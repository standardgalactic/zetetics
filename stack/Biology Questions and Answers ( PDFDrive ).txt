Biology Questions and Answers
Biochemistry 
Introduction
1. What are the chemical 
elements that form most of 
living biological matter?
The chemical elements that form most 
of the molecules of living beings are 
oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H) 
and nitrogen (N).
2. Living beings are made of 
organic and inorganic 
substances. According to the 
complexity of their molecules 
how can each of those 
substances be classified?
Inorganic substances, like water, 
mineral salts, molecular oxygen and 
carbon dioxide, are small molecules 
made of few atoms. Organic substances, 
in general, like glucose, fatty acids and 
proteins, are much more complex 
molecules made of sequences of 
carbons bound in carbon chains. The 
capacity of carbon to form chains is one 
of the main chemical facts that 
permitted the emergence of life on the 
planet.
3. What are the most 
important inorganic molecular 
substances for living beings?
The most important inorganic 
substances for living beings are water, 
mineral salts, carbon dioxide and 
molecular oxygen. (There are several 
other inorganic substances without 
which cells would die.)
4. What are mineral salts? 
Where in living beings can 
mineral salts be found?
Mineral salts are simple inorganic 
substances made of metallic chemical 
elements, like iron, sodium, potassium, 
calcium and magnesium, or of non-
metallic elements, like chlorine and 
phosphorus.
They can be found in non-solubilized 
form, as part of structures of the 
organism, like the calcium in bones. 
They can also be found solubilized in 
water, as ions: for example, the sodium 
and potassium cations within cells.
5. What are the most 
important organic molecules 
for living beings?
There are many types of organic 
molecules that are important for the 
living beings. Especially important are 
amino acids and proteins, carbohydrates 
(including glucose), lipids and nucleic 
acids (DNA and RNA).

Biology Questions and Answers
6. What are the main 
functions of the organic 
molecules for living beings?
Organic molecules, like proteins, lipids 
and carbohydrates, perform several 
functions for living organisms. 
Noteworthy functions are the structural 
function (as part of the material that 
constitutes, delimits and maintains 
organs, membranes, cell organelles, 
etc.), the energetic function (chemical 
reactions of the energetic metabolism), 
the control and informative function 
(genetic code control, inter and 
intracellular signaling, endocrine 
integration) and the enzymatic function 
of proteins (facilitation of chemical 
reactions).
7. What are some examples of 
the structural function of 
organic molecules?
Organic molecules have a structural 
function as they are part of cell 
membranes, cytoskeleton, organ walls 
and blood vessel walls, bones, cartilages 
and, in plants, of the conductive and 
support tissues.
8. What are some examples of 
the energetic function of 
organic molecules?
Since they are complex molecules, 
presenting many chemical bonds, 
organic molecules store large amount of 
energy.
Glucose, for example, is the main 
energy source for the formation of ATP 
(adenosine triphosphate), a molecule 
that is necessary in several metabolic 
reactions. ATP is an organic molecule 
too and is itself the energy source for 
many biochemical reactions. Fat, 
proteins and some types of organic 
polymers, like starch and glycogen, that 
are polymers of glucose, are energy 
reservoirs for the organism.
9. What are some examples of 
the control and informative 
function of organic molecules?
Based on genetic information, organic 
molecules control the entire work of the 
cell. The nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, 
are organic molecules that direct the 
protein synthesis, and proteins in their 
turn are the main molecules responsible 
for the diversity of cellular biological 
tasks. In membranes and within the 
cell, some organic molecules act as 
information receptors and signalers. 
Proteins and lipids have an important 
role in the communication between cells 
and tissues, acting as hormones, 
substances that transmit information at 
a distance throughout the organism.
10. What are biopolymers?
Polymers are macromolecules made by 
the union of several smaller identical 
molecules, called monomers. 
Biopolymers are polymers present in the 
living beings. Cellulose, starch and 
glycogen, for example, are polymers of 
glucose.

Biology Questions and Answers
Water and Mineral 
Salts
1. What is the approximate 
percentage (in mass) of water 
in the human body? Is this 
percentage expected to be 
larger in the adult or in the old 
individual?
Approximately 65% of the human 
individual mass is water. The brain, for 
example, has around 90% of water in 
mass, the muscles, 85%, and the bones 
have between 25% and 40% of water.
Younger adult individuals have 
proportionally more water in mass than 
older individuals.
2. What are the main 
biological functions of water?
Water is the fundamental solvent for 
chemical reactions of living beings; it is 
the main means of substance 
transportation in the cell and between 
cells and tissues and it is responsible for 
the maintenance of adequate 
temperature for the functioning of the 
organism. Water is also the reagent or 
the product of many biochemical 
reactions, like photosynthesis, cellular 
respiration, peptide bond for protein 
formation, etc.
3. Water has key participation 
in organic reactions. What are 
examples of two types of 
organic reactions in which 
water is respectively 
incorporated or liberated in 
the products of these 
reactions?
Photosynthesis is a biochemical process 
in which water is incorporated into 
organic molecules. In the reaction, the 
hydrogen atoms from water go to the 
produced glucose and the oxygen atoms 
from water form the molecular oxygen 
liberated: carbon dioxide + water + 
light = glucose + molecular oxygen. 
Aerobic respiration is an example of 
biochemical reaction in which water is 
produced: glucose + molecular oxygen 
= carbon dioxide + water.
4. Is water a polar or a non-
polar molecule? What is the 
consequence of that 
characteristic for the function 
of water as solvent?
Water is made of two atoms of 
hydrogen attached by covalent bond 
with one central atom of oxygen making 
an angular spatial structure. The 
hydrogen atoms “lend” electrons to the 
oxygen and consequently this atom 
becomes more negative while the 
hydrogens become more positive. The 
spatial geometry of the water molecule 
makes it a polar molecule, with negative 
and positive poles.

Biology Questions and Answers
Water is an excellent solvent for polar 
substances because the electrical 
activity (attraction and repulsion) of its 
poles helps the separation and the 
mixing of these substances, giving them 
more movement and thus increasing the 
number of molecular collisions and the 
speed of chemical reactions. On the 
other hand, water is not good as a 
solvent for non-polar substances.
Polarity is one of the water properties.
5. Which kind of polarity do 
water-soluble and fat-soluble 
substances respectively have?
Water-soluble substances are polar 
molecules, i.e., they have electrically 
charged areas. These molecules get the 
description “water-soluble” because 
they are soluble in water, a polar 
molecule too.
Fat-soluble substances are non-polar 
molecules, i.e., they are electrically 
neutral. They get the description “fat-
soluble” because they dissolve other 
non-polar substances.
6. What is the importance of 
water for enzymatic activity?
Enzymes, biological catalysts, depend 
on water to reach their substrates and 
bind to them. There is no enzymatic 
activity without water. In addition, 
enzymes depend on adequate pH 
interval to work and the pH is a 
consequence of the liberation of 
hydrogen cations (H+) and hydroxyl 
anions (OH-) by acids and bases in 
water solution.
7. Can the heat capacity of 
water be considered small or 
large? What is the biological 
significance of that 
characteristic?
From Thermology it is known that the 
quantity of exchanged heat (Q) is equal 
to the mass (m) multiplied by the 
specific heat of the substance (c) 
multiplied by the variation of 
temperature (T), Q = m.c.ΔT., and that 
heat capacity is Q/T, hence, m.c. Heat 
capacity, however, relates to a specific 
body, since it considers mass, whereas 
specific heat relates to the general 
substance. Therefore it is more correct 
to refer to specific heat in this problem.
Water has a specific heat of 1 cal/g.oC 
which means that 1 oC per gram is 
changed in its temperature with the 
addition or subtraction of 1 cal of 
energy. This is a very elevated value 
(for example, the specific heat of 
ethanol is 0,58 cal/g.oC, and mercury, a 
metal, has a specific heat of 0,033 
cal/g. oC) making water an excellent 
thermal protector against variations of 
temperature. Even if sudden external 
temperature changes occur, the internal 
biological conditions are kept stable in 
organisms which contain enough water.
High specific heat is one of the most 
important water properties.

Biology Questions and Answers
8. What are the main water 
properties that make water 
special for life?
The water properties that make water 
biologically important are molecular 
polarity, thermal stability (elevated 
specific heat), fusion and ebullition 
points that allow water to be liquid in 
most environments, acid-base 
neutrality, small molecular size and low 
chemical reactivity. (Compared to other 
substances, like ethanol or hydrogen 
sulfide.)
9. What are ions? What are 
the two types of molecules 
into which ions are classified?
Ions are atoms or substances 
electrically charged by means of loss or 
gain of electrons.
The two types of ions are the cations 
and the anions. Cations are ions with 
positive total electric charge and anions 
are ions with negative total electric 
charge.
10. Which are the main 
positive ions found in living 
beings?
The main cations found in living beings 
are the sodium cation (Na+), the 
potassium cation (K+), the calcium 
cation (Ca++), the iron cations (Fe++, 
Fe+++), the magnesium cation (Mg++), 
the zinc cation (Zn++) and the 
manganese cation (Mn++).
11. What are the main 
negative ions found in living 
beings?
The main anions found in living beings 
are the chlorine anion (Cl-), the 
phosphate anion (PO4
--), the bicarbonate 
anion (HCO3
-), the nitrate anion (NO3
-) 
and the sulfate anion (SO4
-).
12. How do mineral salts 
participate in osmotic 
regulation?
Osmotic pressure depends on the 
number of particles dissolved in a 
solution and not on the nature of such 
particles. Mineral salts, glucose, 
proteins and urea are the main 
regulating particles for the osmolarity of 
the organism. These molecules along 
with other particles inside and outside 
the cell generate the larger or smaller 
osmotic gradient between the 
intracellular and the extracellular space.
13. What is the role of mineral 
salts in the creation of electric 
tension (voltage) at the 
cellular level?
The electric activity of the cell, for 
example, in neurons, depends on the 
different concentrations of positive and 
negative ions between the inner and the 
outer surfaces of the cell membrane. 
Mineral salts are responsible for that 
voltage.
The cell membrane of non-excited cell 
has commonly a negative inner side and

Biology Questions and Answers
a positive outer side. This electrical 
situation is maintained by ion transport 
across the membrane.
14. Why is pH regulation 
important for living beings? 
How do mineral salts 
participate in this regulation?
The potential of hydrogen (pH) is a 
measure of the amount of hydrogen 
ions (H-) in a solution. The regulation of 
the pH according to the necessities of 
each organ or tissue is extremely 
important for the organism since 
enzymes act only under some pH 
ranges and many proteins are only 
active under some pH ranges. Therefore 
biochemical reactions depend on correct 
levels of pH to occur.
Neutral pH is one of the water 
properties.
15. How do mineral salts 
participate in enzymatic 
activity?
Many mineral salts are cofactors of 
enzymes, i.e., they are substances 
without which enzymes do not work.
16. What are the main 
biological processes in which 
calcium participates?
Calcium is present in almost all cells and 
has several functions.
Calcium has an important role in 
muscular contraction, in the blood 
coagulation process, in the structure of 
bone tissue, in teeth, in the motility of 
the sperm cell flagellum and in the 
nervous transmission.
17. What is hemoglobin? What 
is the inorganic element that 
is fundamental in the 
composition of hemoglobin?
Hemoglobin is the protein present in the 
blood responsible for the transport of 
oxygen from the lungs to the tissues 
and cells.
The hemoglobin molecule is composed 
of four protein chains, each with a heme 
group containing an iron atom. The iron 
is responsible for the binding of oxygen 
in the lungs and also for the red color of 
hemoglobin and thus of the blood.
18. What is the importance of 
magnesium for plants? What 
are the other main biological 
functions of magnesium?
Magnesium is fundamentally important 
for plants because it is part of the 
chlorophyll molecule (and chlorophyll is 
essential for photosynthesis).
Magnesium also acts as a cofactor of 
several enzymes and it is important the 
muscle relaxation and for the nervous 
transmission.

19. What is phosphorylation? 
What are some biological 
processes in which 
phosphorylation plays a 
critical role?
Phosphorylation is the name given to 
processes of the addition of phosphates 
to some molecules thus making these 
molecules more energized. 
Phosphorylation has an important role, 
for example, in photosynthesis (the 
photophosphorylation of the light phase) 
and in aerobic respiration (oxidative 
phosphorylation of the respiratory 
chain). In general the phosphate used in 
phosphorylation comes from ATP 
molecules.
20. Why is iodine important 
for human beings?
Iodine is a fundamental chemical 
element for the proper functioning of 
the thyroid since it is part of the 
hormones produced by this gland. 
Iodine deficiency creates a kind of 
hypothyroidism, a disease known as 
endemic goiter.
21. What are the main 
biological functions in which 
chlorine ions participate?
Like sodium cations, chlorine anions 
actively participate in the regulation of 
the osmolarity of tissues and cells by 
crossing the cellular membrane and 
avoiding entrance of water into the cell 
or excessive loss of water from the cell. 
Chlorine anions have an important role 
for the acid-base balance of the 
organism since they participate, along 
with bicarbonate anions, in the pH 
buffer system of the body. Another 
function of chlorine is in the digestive 
physiology: inside the gastric lumen, 
hydrochloric acid secreted by stomach 
cells ionizes itself into hydrogen and 
chlorine ions lowering the pH of the 
gastric juice and then permitting the 
enzymatic digestion to take place.

Biology Questions and Answers
Carbohydrates
1. What are the organic 
chemical groups that 
characterize carbohydrates? 
How are carbohydrates 
classified according to the 
presence of those groups?
Carbohydrates are also known as sugars 
(starches, cellulose and other 
substances are carbohydrates too).
Carbohydrates are polyhydroxylated 
aldehydes or polyhydroxylated ketones 
(polyalcohol aldehydes or polyalcohol 
ketones).
Polyhydroxylated aldehydes are called 
aldoses and polyhydroxylated ketones 
are called ketoses.
2. What is the molecular 
formula of glucose? How can 
its structural formula be 
described?
The molecular formula of glucose is 
C6H12O6.
Structurally glucose is a hexagonal ring 
formed by one atom of oxygen and five 
atoms of carbon; a hydroxyl radical and 
a hydrogen atom bind in each carbon of 
the ring, except for one of the carbons 
bound to the oxygen of the ring; this 
carbon binds to a CH2OH radical. Spatial 
sides of hydroxyl bonds are alternated.
3. What are monosaccharides, 
oligosaccharides and 
polysaccharides?
Monosaccharides are simple molecules 
of carbohydrates that cannot be broken 
into smaller molecules of other 
carbohydrates. Oligosaccharides are 
carbohydrates made by union of a 
maximum of 10 monosaccharides. 
Polysaccharides are polymers of 
monosaccharides made of more than 10 
units of such monomers. The most 
important polysaccharides are cellulose, 
starch, glycogen and chitin.
4. What is the difference 
between monosaccharides and 
disaccharides? What are some 
examples of disaccharides and 
of monosaccharides that form 
them?
Monosaccharides are simple molecules 
of carbohydrates that cannot be broken 
into other carbohydrates. Glucose and 
fructose are examples of 
monosaccharides. Disaccharides are 
carbohydrates made of two 
monosaccharides and with the loss of 
one molecule of water (dehydration). 
The chemical bond between two 
monosaccharides is known as a 
glycosidic bond.
Sucrose (table sugar) is a disaccharide 
made by the union of one molecule of 
glucose with one molecule of fructose. 
Maltose is a disaccharide made by two 
glucose molecules. Lactose (milk sugar) 
is another disaccharide and it is created

role as energy sources for the 
metabolism.
6. What are pentoses? What 
are the roles of pentoses in 
DNA and RNA molecules?
Pentoses are carbohydrates made of 
five carbons.
The DNA molecule is made of a 
sequence of molecules called 
nucleotides. Each nucleotide is formed 
by the association of one pentose called 
deoxyribose with a phosphoric acid and 
a nitrogen-containing base (A, T, C or 
G). RNA is also formed by a sequence of 
nucleotides. The RNA nucleotides are 
made by association of one ribose (a 
pentose) with one phosphoric acid and 
one nitrogen-containing base (A, U, C or 
G).
So pentoses are fundamental 
components of DNA and RNA.
7. What are the main 
biological functions of the 
polysaccharides?
Polysaccharides have an energy storage 
function and a structural function. 
Polysaccharides incorporated by living 
beings along the food chain are 
important sources of carbohydrates for 
the energetic metabolism of organisms 
of the next trophic levels.
Starch is the polysaccharide used for 
energy store by plants. Glycogen is a 
macromolecule responsible for the 
storage of glucose in the liver and 
muscles. Chitin is a polysaccharide with 
structural functions that constitutes the 
exoskeleton of the arthropods and the 
cell wall in fungi.

Biology Questions and Answers
Lipids
1. What are the main types of 
lipids?
The main types of lipids are triglycerides 
(fats and oils), phospholipids, waxes 
and steroids.
2. What is the structural 
formula of glycerol? To which 
organic function do these 
molecules belong?
Glycerol is a linear chain of three 
carbons; the central carbon is bound to 
one hydroxyl radical and to one 
hydrogen and the two other carbons in 
the extremities are bound to a hydroxyl 
radical and to two hydrogens. Spatial 
sides of the hydroxyls are the same.
3. How are triglycerides 
made?
Triglycerides, fats or oils, are made of 
three molecules of fatty acids bound to 
one molecule of glycerol. Hydroxyls of 
each one of the three fatty acids and 
each hydrogen of the hydroxyls of the 
glycerol bind to form three molecules of 
water that are liberated.
4. What are phospholipids?
Phospholipids are molecules made of 
glycerol bound to two long molecules of 
fatty acids and to one phosphate group. 
Therefore, phospholipids are 
amphipathic molecules, i.e., they have a 
non-polar portion, due to the long fatty 
acid chains, and a polar portion, due to 
the group phosphate.
Phospholipids are the main component 
of cell membranes. Sphingomyelin, the 
substance that forms the myelin sheath 
of axons in the nervous system, is a 
phospholipid too.
5. What are steroids? What 
are some examples of steroids 
with a biological function?
Steroids are lipids based in an angular 
combination of four carbon rings, three 
of them made of six carbons and one 
ring made of five carbons in the 
extremity. The union of each ring to the 
adjacent ring is made by the sharing of 
two adjacent carbons belonging to both 
rings.
Bile salts, cholesterol, the sexual 
hormones estrogen, progesterone and 
testosterone, the corticosteroids and the 
pro-vitamin D are examples of steroids.

Biology Questions and Answers
6. What are hydrophobic 
molecules (or hydrophobic 
molecular regions)? What are 
hydrophilic molecules? How 
can they be characterized in 
relation to their polarity?
Hydrophobic molecules are those that 
have little or no propensity to dissolve 
in water (hydro = water, phobia = fear). 
Hydrophilic molecules are those that 
have great propensity to dissolve in 
water (philia = friendship).
Water is a polar substance. 
Remembering the rule that “equal 
dissolves equal” one can conclude that 
hydrophobic substances are non-polar 
molecules while hydrophilic molecules 
are polar molecules.
7. Are organic solvents like 
benzene and ether polar or 
non-polar substances?
Benzene and the ethers are molecules 
without electrically charged portions and 
thus they are non-polar substances.
8. Regarding solubility, how 
are lipids classified?
Fats and oils are hydrophobic molecules, 
i.e., they are non polar and insoluble in 
water. Lipids in general are molecules 
with a large non-polar extension and so 
they are soluble in non polar solvents, 
like benzene, ether and chloroform.
There are some amphipathic lipids, i.e., 
lipids whose molecules have a 
hydrophilic portion, like the 
phospholipids, giving them the property 
of being dragged by water, and a 
hydrophobic portion (non polar).
9. What is meant by 
saturation or unsaturation of 
oils and fats?
When it is said that a triglyceride is 
saturated it means that in its molecule 
the carbon chain is bound in its 
maximum capacity to hydrogens, i.e., 
there are no double or triple bonds 
between carbons. These saturated 
molecules are generally solid fats at 
normal temperature.
Unsaturated triglyceride molecules are 
those in which there are double or triple 
bonds between carbons and so they do 
not accomplish their maximum capacity 
of hydrogenation. These unsaturated 
molecules in general are oils, liquid at 
normal temperature.
The terms saturated or unsaturated 
refer then to the saturation of the 
carbonic chain by hydrogen atoms.

Biology Questions and Answers
Proteins
1. What are proteins? How can 
the protein diversity of living 
beings be explained?
Proteins are molecules made of 
sequences of amino acids bound by a 
peptide bond.
The genetic code codifies twenty 
different amino acids that can compose 
proteins. So there are numerous 
combinations of amino acid which can 
form polypeptide chains and for this 
reason protein molecules can be 
immensely diverse.
2. What is the importance of 
proteins for living beings?
Proteins play a fundamental role in 
nearly all biological processes. Due to 
their diversity they can assume many 
different configurations and they can 
play varied roles in cells and tissues.
Some protein functions are noteworthy: 
the structural function (cell membrane 
proteins, cytoskeleton proteins, proteins 
of the connective tissue), the enzymatic 
function (enzymes are proteins), the 
energy storage function (proteins can 
be degraded into acetyl-CoA and “cycle” 
the Krebs cycle), the osmotic regulation 
function (albumin), the transportation 
function (membrane channels, 
respiratory pigments), the immune 
protection function (antibodies), the 
movement function (contractile 
proteins), the endocrine integration 
function (hormones) and the 
informative function (membrane 
receptors, intracellular signalers). There 
are also many proteins whose biological 
functions are not yet known.
3. What is the constitutional 
unit of proteins?
The constitutional units of proteins are 
the amino acids.
4. What is an oligopeptide? 
How is it different from a 
polypeptide?
Peptide is the molecule formed by the 
union of amino acids through the 
peptide bond. Oligopeptide is a peptide 
made of few amino acids (oligo = few). 
Polypeptides are peptides with many 
amino acids (poli = many), in general 
more than 50.
5. How many are the known 
amino acids that form proteins 
in living beings?
There are twenty different known amino 
acids that form proteins related to the 
genetic code of the living beings.
There are still many other amino acids 
as yet not known.

Biology Questions and Answers
6. Does every amino acid have 
a central carbon? To which 
organic group is that central 
carbon bound?
A carboxyl group –COOH, an amine 
group – NH2, an atom of hydrogen –H 
and a variable radical -R necessarily are 
bound to the central carbon of an amino 
acid.
7. How can amine groups be 
classified?
Amines can be classified into primary 
amines, those to which one –R (variable 
radical) is attached to a –NH2, 
secondary amines, those where one 
hydrogen of NH2 is substituted by 
another –R, thus having two –R, and 
tertiary amines, those with no hydrogen 
bound to the nitrogen and with three –
R.
8. What is the structural 
representation of a carboxyl 
group?
Carboxyl groups have a carbon attached 
to one hydroxyl group by a simple bond 
and to one oxygen by a double bond. 
The other site of binding in the carbon is 
available to other chemical entities.
9. What is the structural flat 
representation of an amino 
acid molecule?
An amino acid has a central carbon to 
which a carboxyl group binds on a side 
and to which a –R (variable radical) 
binds on the opposite side. In the 
perpendicular direction of those ligands 
an amine group binds the central carbon 
on one side and a hydrogen binds on 
the opposite side.
The bind of the carboxyl group to a 
carbon where a hydrogen is laterally 
attached is responsible for the name 
“acid” in amino acids. The bound of an 
amine group in the central carbon 
provides the name “amino”.
10. What is the importance of 
the –R group (variable 
radical) in an amino acid 
molecule?
The –R group, also called a lateral 
chain, is the variable part of the amino 
acid molecule. The –R group can be a 
complex carbonic chain, a substituting 
methyl group (forming then the amino 
acid alanine) or even only a hydrogen 
(forming glycine, the simplest amino 
acid). So the –R group is important 
because it is the differentiation factor of 
amino acids.
11. How can the binding of 
two amino acids for the 
peptide formation be 
described?
A peptide is formed when a carbon from 
the carboxyl group of one amino acid is 
connected to the nitrogen of the amine 
group of another amino acid. During

that binding the hydroxyl of the 
carboxyl and one hydrogen of the amine 
is lost resulting in the liberation of one 
water molecule.
12. What is the binding 
between two amino acids 
called?
The chemical bond between two amino 
acids is called a peptide bond.
13. Do the –R groups bound to 
the central carbons participate 
in the union between amino 
acids?
The peptide bond attaches the nitrogen 
of the amine group of one amino acid to 
the carbon of the carboxyl group of 
another amino acid liberating one 
molecule of water. So the –R groups do 
not participate in that bond.
14. Do the –H groups bound to 
the central carbons participate 
in the peptide bond?
The central carbons themselves, the –R 
groups and the hydrogens attached to 
the central carbons do not participate in 
the peptide bond.
15. Do the amine and the 
carboxyl groups attached to 
central carbons participate in 
the union between amino 
acids?
Yes. The nitrogen of the amine group of 
one amino acid binds to the carbon of 
the carboxyl group of the other amino 
acid. The water molecule liberated from 
the formation of the peptide bond thus 
has a hydrogen from the amine and an 
oxygen and another hydrogen from the 
carboxyl.
16. Does the chemical reaction 
to unite amino acids 
incorporate or liberate atoms? 
What are the chemical entities 
incorporated or liberated in 
this reaction?
The union of amino acids by peptide 
bond liberates atoms. They are liberated 
as constituents of one molecule of 
water.
17. Are there different 
proteins made by the same 
total number of amino acids?
Different proteins with the same total 
number of amino acids may exist. In 
such cases the differentiation is given 
by the types of amino acids or by the 
sequence in which they form the 
protein.

Biology Questions and Answers
18. Are proteins with the 
same number of each different 
amino acid that form them 
necessarily identical proteins?
Even if many proteins have the same 
number of each different amino acid 
that form them, for example, 50 
alanines, 70 glycines and 20 histidines, 
the sequences in which these amino 
acids are connected may be very 
different. So if two or more proteins are 
in such condition of numeric similarity 
for each type of their constituent amino 
acids, they are not necessarily identical.
19. What is the essential 
condition for a protein to be 
identical to another protein?
For a protein to be identical to another 
protein it is necessary for the sequence 
of amino acids that form them to be 
identical.
20. What is the primary 
structure of a protein? What is 
the importance of the primary 
structure?
The primary protein structure is the 
linear sequence of amino acids that 
form the molecule.
The primary structure is the basis of the 
protein identity. Modification of only one 
amino acid of the primary structure 
creates a different protein. This different 
protein can be inactive or can even have 
other biological functions.
21. What is the secondary 
structure of a protein?
The secondary protein structure is 
generated by the manner its amino 
acids interact through the 
intermolecular bond. These interactions 
create a spatial conformation of the 
polypeptide filament. The two most 
studied secondary conformations of 
proteins are the alpha-helix and the 
beta-sheet.
22. What is the difference 
between the alpha-helix and 
the beta-sheet protein 
conformations?
Alpha-helix and beta-sheet 
conformations are the two main types of 
secondary structure of a protein 
molecule. According to the primary 
protein structure its secondary structure 
can be of one type or the other.
In the alpha-helix structure the 
polypeptide curls longitudinally by the 
action of hydrogen bonds forming a 
spiral, or helix. In the beta-sheet 
conformation the protein is more 
distended and the hydrogen bonds form 
a zig-zag-shaped protein structure 
called B-strand. Many assembled beta-
strands make a beta-sheet.
23. What is the tertiary 
structure of a protein? What 
are the main types of tertiary 
structure?
www.biology-questions-and-answers.com
25
Buyer: Victoria Proctor (vicproc6@gmail.com)
Transaction ID: 4KS71350WY6468607

Biology Questions and Answers
The tertiary protein structure is a spatial 
conformation additional to the 
secondary structure in which the alpha-
helix or the beta-sheet folds itself up. 
The forces that keep the tertiary 
structure generally are interactions 
between the –R groups of the amino 
acids and between other parts of the 
protein and water molecules of the 
solution.
The main types of tertiary structure of 
proteins are the globular proteins and 
the fibrous proteins.
24. What is the quaternary 
structure of a protein? Do all 
proteins have quaternary 
structure?
The quaternary protein structure is the 
spatial conformation due to interactions 
among polypeptide chains that form the 
protein.
Only those proteins made of two or 
more polypeptide chains have 
quaternary structure. Insulin (two 
chains), hemoglobin (four chains) and 
the immunoglobulins (antibodies, four 
chains) are some examples of protein 
having quaternary structure.
25. What is protein 
denaturation? Is there any 
change in the primary 
structure when a protein is 
denatured?
Secondary, tertiary and quaternary 
structures of proteins are spatial 
structures. Denaturation is modification 
in any of these spatial structures that 
makes the protein deficient or 
biologically inactive.
After denaturation the primary protein 
structure is not affected.
26. How can denaturation be 
classified regarding its 
reversibility?
Protein denaturation can be a reversible 
or an irreversible process, i.e., it may 
be possible or impossible to make the 
protein regain its original spatial 
conformation.
27. What are some factors 
that can lead to protein 
denaturation?
Protein denaturation can be caused by 
temperature variation, pH change, 
changes in the concentration of 
surrounding solutes and by other 
processes. Most proteins denature after 
certain elevation of temperature or 
when in very acid or very basic 
solutions. This is one of the main 
reasons that it is necessary for the 
organisms to keep stable temperature 
and pH.

28. Is it expected that a 
change in the primary, in the 
secondary or in the tertiary 
structure of a protein will 
produce more functional 
consequences?
Any change of the protein structure is 
relevant if it alters its biological activity. 
Changes in the primary protein 
structure are more important because 
they are modifications in the 
composition of the molecule and such 
composition determines all other 
structures of the protein.
29. In sickle cell anemia, a 
hereditary disease, there is 
substitution of one amino acid 
by another in one of the four 
polypeptide chains of 
hemoglobin. In this case are 
all of the structural levels of 
the protein modified?
In sickle cell disease there is a change 
in the primary protein structure of one 
of the polypeptide chains that form 
hemoglobin: the amino acid glutamic 
acid is substituted by the amino acid 
valine in the β chain. The spatial 
conformation of the molecule in addition 
is also affected and modified by this 
primary “mistake” and the modification 
also creates a different (sickle) shape to 
the red blood cells.
Modified, sickled, red blood cells 
sometimes aggregate and obstruct the 
peripheral circulation causing tissue 
hypoxia and the pain crisis typical of 
sickle cell anemia.
30. What is the difference 
between essential and natural 
amino acids?
Essential amino acids are those that the 
organism is not able to synthesize and 
that need to be ingested by the 
individual. Natural amino acids are 
those that are produced by the 
organism.
There are living species that produce 
every amino acid they need, for 
example, the bacteria Escherichia coli, 
that does not have essential amino 
acids. Other species, like humans, need 
to obtain essential amino acids from the 
diet. Among the twenty different known 
amino acids that form proteins humans 
can make twelve of them and the 
remaining eight need to be taken from 
the proteins they ingest with food.
The essential amino acids for humans 
are phenylalanine, histidine, isoleucine, 
lysine, methionine, threonine, 
tryptophane and valine.
31. What are respectively 
some remarkable functions of 
myosin, CD4, albumin, keratin, 
immunoglobulin, reverse 
transcriptase, hemoglobin and 
insulin?
Myosin is a protein that when associated 
with actin produces a muscular 
contraction. CD4 is a membrane protein 
of some lymphocytes, the cells that are 
infected by HIV. Albumin is an energy 
storage protein and also an important 
regulator of the blood osmolarity.

Biology Questions and Answers
Enzymes
1. What are catalysts?
Catalysts are substances that reduce 
the activation energy of a chemical 
reaction, facilitating it or making it 
energetically viable. The catalyst 
increases the speed of the chemical 
reaction.
2. What amount of catalyst is 
consumed in the reaction it 
catalyzes?
Catalysts are not consumed in the 
reactions they catalyze.
3. Is there a difference 
between the initial and the 
final energy levels in 
catalyzed and non-catalyzed 
reactions?
The catalysis does not alter the 
energetic state of reagents and products 
of a chemical reaction. Only the energy 
necessary for the reaction to occur, i.e., 
the activation energy, is altered.
4. What are enzymes? What is 
the importance of enzymes for 
living beings?
Enzymes are proteins that are catalysts 
of chemical reactions. From Chemistry it 
is known that catalysts are non-
consumable substances that reduce the 
activation energy necessary for a 
chemical reaction to occur.
Enzymes are highly specific to the 
reactions they catalyze. They are of vital 
importance for life because most 
chemical reactions of the cells and 
tissues are catalyzed by enzymes. 
Without enzymatic action those 
reactions would not occur or would not 
happen in the required speed for the 
biological processes in which they 
participate.
5. What is meant by 
substrates of enzymatic 
reactions?
Substrates are reagent molecules upon 
which enzymes act.
The enzyme has spatial binding sites for 
the attachment of its substrate. These 
sites are called activation centers of the 
enzyme. Substrates bind to theses 
centers forming the enzyme-substrate 
complex.
6. What are the main 
theoretical models that try to 
explain the formation of the 
enzyme-substrate complex?
There are two main models that explain 
the formation of the enzyme-substrate 
complex: the lock and key model and 
the induced fit model.
www.biology-questions-and-answers.com
29
Buyer: Victoria Proctor (vicproc6@gmail.com)
Transaction ID: 4KS71350WY6468607

Biology Questions and Answers
In the lock and key model the enzyme 
has a region with specific spatial 
conformation for the binding of the 
substrate. In the induced fit model the 
binding of the substrate induces a 
change in the spatial configuration of 
the enzyme for the substrate to fit.
7. How does the formation of 
the enzyme-substrate 
complex explain the reduction 
of the activation energy of 
chemical reactions?
The enzyme possibly works as a test 
tube within which reagents meet to 
form products. With the facilitation of 
the meeting provided by enzymes it is 
easier for collisions between reagents to 
occur and thus the activation energy of 
the chemical reaction is reduced. This is 
one of the possible hypotheses.
8. On what structural level of 
the enzyme (primary, 
secondary, tertiary or 
quaternary) does the enzyme-
substrate interaction depend?
The substrate binds to the enzyme in 
the activation centers. These are 
specific three-dimensional sites and 
thus they depend on the protein tertiary 
and quaternary structures. The primary 
and secondary structures, however, 
condition the other structures and so 
they are equally important.
9. What is the activation 
center of an enzyme? Is it the 
key or the lock of the lock and 
key model?
The activation center is a region of the 
enzyme produced by its spatial 
conformation to which the substrate 
binds. In the lock and key model the 
activation center is the lock and the 
substrate is the key.
10. Why can it be said that the 
enzymatic action is highly 
specific?
The enzymatic action is highly specific 
because only specific substrates of one 
enzyme bind to the activation center of 
that enzyme. Each enzyme generally 
catalyzes only a specific chemical 
reaction.
11. What happens to a 
denatured enzyme regarding 
its functionality? How can that 
result be explained with the 
help of the lock and key 
model?
According to the lock and key model the 
enzyme functionality depends entirely 
on the integrity of the activation center, 
a molecular region with specific spatial 
characteristics. After the denaturation 
the spatial conformation of the protein 
is modified, the activation center is 
destroyed and the enzyme loses its 
catalytic activity.

Biology Questions and Answers
12. What are the main factors 
that alter the speed of 
enzymatic reactions?
The main factors that change the speed 
of enzymatic reactions are temperature, 
pH and substrate concentration 
(quantity).
13. How does the substrate 
concentration affect the speed 
of enzymatic reactions?
Initially as substrate concentration 
increases, the speed of the reaction 
increases; this happens because free 
activation centers of the enzyme bind to 
free substrates. Once all activation 
centers of the available enzymes 
become bound to their substrates new 
increments of the substrate 
concentration will have no effect on the 
speed of the reaction.
14. How does temperature 
affect the action of enzymes 
upon their substrates?
There are defined temperature ranges 
under which enzymes operate and there 
is a specific temperature level (optimum 
temperature) in which enzymes have 
maximum efficiency. Therefore 
temperature variations affect enzymatic 
activity and the speed of the reactions 
they catalyze.
In addition, as proteins, enzymes can be 
denatured under extreme temperatures.
15. Concerning enzymatic 
reactions, how different are 
the graphic curve of the 
variation of the speed of a 
reaction as function of 
substrate concentration and 
the curve of variation of the 
speed of a reaction as function 
of temperature?
The curve of variation of speed of the 
enzymatic reaction as a function of 
growing substrate concentration is a 
growing curve until the point where it 
stabilizes due to the saturation of the 
activation centers of the enzymes.
The curve of variation of speed of the 
enzymatic reaction as a function of 
growing temperature has a crescent 
portion and reaches a peak (the 
optimum temperature) then it decreases 
and reaches zero in the point of 
inactivity of the enzymes by 
denaturation.
16. How is the cooling of 
organs and tissues for medical 
transplants associated with 
the effect of temperature 
upon enzymatic reactions?
The molecular degradation during the 
decomposition of organs and tissues is 
catalyzed by enzymes. The cooling to 
adequate temperatures of some organs 
and tissues destined for transplantation 
reduces that enzyme activity and thus 
lessens the natural decomposition 
process. By the same rationale, the 
cooling reduces the metabolic work of 
cells and prevents degradation of their

own structures to obtain energy. 
Elevation of temperature later reverts 
denaturation of enzymes and the organs 
and tissues also preserved by other 
specific techniques may be grafted into 
the receptors.
17. Does pH affect the enzyme 
activity?
The concentration of hydrogen ions in 
solution affects the enzyme activity. 
Each enzyme has maximal efficiency 
under an optimum pH.
Since pH is one of the factors for the 
denaturation of proteins, if an enzyme is 
submitted to a pH level under which it is 
denatured there will be no enzymatic 
activity.
18. Do enzymes act better 
under acid or basic pH?
Most enzymes act in pH between 6 and 
8, a range that corresponds to the 
general acidic level of cells and blood. 
There are enzymes, however, that act 
only under very acid or very basic pH. 
So enzyme activity depends on pH 
interval.
In the stomach, for example, the gastric 
juice has a very low pH, around 2, and 
there the enzyme pepsin acts to 
intensively digest proteins. In the 
duodenum, pancreatic secretions 
increase the pH of the enteric juice for 
the action of other digestive enzymes, 
for example, trypsin.
19. Since pepsin is a gastric 
enzyme does it have an acid 
or basic optimum pH? What 
happens to pepsin when it 
passes into the duodenum?
Pepsin acts within the stomach so its 
optimum pH is around 2, an acid pH. 
When the enzyme passes into the 
duodenum it meets a higher pH and its 
enzyme activity ends.
20. What are enzyme 
cofactors?
Some enzymes need other associated 
molecules to work. These molecules are 
called enzyme cofactors and they can 
be, for example, organic ions like 
mineral salts, or organic molecules.
Inactive enzymes which are not bound 
to their cofactors are called 
apoenzymes. Active enzymes bound to 
their cofactors are called holoenzymes.
21. What is the relationship 
between vitamins and enzyme 
cofactors?
Many vitamins are enzyme cofactors 
that cannot be synthesized by the 
organism and must be obtained from 
the diet.

22. For the enzymatic reaction 
what is the effect of a 
substance with the same 
spatial conformation as an 
enzymatic substrate? How is 
this type of substance known?
Substances that “simulate” substrates 
can bind to the activation center of 
enzymes thus blocking the true 
substrates to bind to these enzymes and 
paralyzing the enzymatic reaction. Such 
“fake substrates” are called enzyme 
inhibitors.
The binding of enzyme inhibitors to 
enzymes can be reversible or 
irreversible.
Many medical drugs, for example, some 
antibiotics, antivirals, antineoplastics, 
antihypertensives and even sildenafil 
(trade name Viagra), are enzyme 
inhibitors that block enzyme activity.
23. What is the action 
mechanism of the antibiotic 
penicillin?
Penicillin, discovered by the Scottish 
doctor Alexander Fleming in 1928, is a 
drug that inhibits enzymes necessary 
for the synthesis of peptidoglycans, a 
constituent of the bacterial cell wall. 
With the inhibition the bacterial 
population stops growing because there 
is no new cell wall formation.
Fleming won the Nobel prize in Medicine 
for the discovery of penicillin.
24. What is the action 
mechanism of the 
antiretroviral drugs called 
protease inhibitors which are 
used against HIV infection?
Protease inhibitors are some of the 
antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV 
infection. Protease is an enzyme 
necessary for the assembling of HIV 
after the synthesis of its proteins within 
the host cell. The protease inhibitor 
binds to the activation center of the 
enzyme blocking the formation of the 
enzyme-substrate complex and the 
enzyme activity thus impairing the viral 
replication.
25. What are allosteric 
enzymes?
Allosteric enzymes are those that have 
more than one activation center and to 
which other substances, called allosteric 
regulators, bind.
Allosteric regulators can be allosteric 
inhibitors or allosteric activators. The 
interaction between an allosteric 
enzyme and the allosteric inhibitor 
disallows the binding of the substrate to 
the enzyme. The interaction between 
the allosteric enzyme and the allosteric 
activator allows the binding of the 
substrate to the enzyme and sometimes 
increases the affinity of the enzyme for 
the substrate. This regulatory 
phenomenon of the enzyme activity is 
called allosterism.

Biology Questions and Answers
26. What are zymogens?
Zymogens, or proenzymes, are 
enzymes secreted in inactive form. 
Under certain conditions a zymogen 
shifts to the active form of the enzyme. 
Zymogen secretions in general happen 
because the enzyme activity can harm 
the secretory tissue.
For example, the pepsinogen secreted 
by the stomach becomes active under 
acid pH turning into the enzyme pepsin. 
Other well-known zymogens are 
trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen, 
enzymes that are secreted by the 
exocrine pancreas and which become 
trypsin and chymotrypsin respectively.

Biology Questions and Answers
Nucleic Acids
1. What are nucleic acids? 
What is the historic origin of 
this name?
DNA and RNA, the nucleic acids, are the 
molecules responsible for the hereditary 
information that commands the protein 
synthesis in living beings. The name 
“nucleic” derives from the fact that they 
were discovered (by the Swiss 
biochemist Friedrich Miescher, in 1869) 
within the cell nucleus. In that time it 
was not known that those substances 
contained the hereditary information.
2. Of what units are nucleic 
acids constituted? What are 
the chemical entities that 
compose that unit?
Nucleic acids are formed by sequences 
of nucleotides.
Nucleotides are constituted by one 
molecule of sugar (deoxyribose in DNA 
and ribose in RNA) bound to one 
molecule of phosphate and to one 
nitrogen-containing base (adenine, 
uracil, cytosine or guanine, in RNA, and 
adenine, thymine, cytosine and 
guanine, in DNA).
3. What are pentoses? To 
what organic group do 
pentoses belong? Are 
nucleotides formed of only 
one type of pentose?
Pentoses are carbohydrates made of 
five carbons. Deoxyribose is the pentose 
that constitutes DNA nucleotides and 
ribose is the pentose that is part of RNA 
nucleotides.
4. Into which two groups can 
the nitrogen-containing bases 
that form DNA and RNA be 
classified? What is the 
criterion used in that 
classification?
The nitrogen-containing bases that form 
DNA and RNA are classified as 
pyrimidine and purine bases.
By the analysis of the structural 
formulae of those nitrogen-containing 
bases it is possible to realize that three 
of them, cytosine, thymine and uracil, 
have only one nitrogenized carbon ring. 
The others, adenine and guanine, have 
two nitrogenized associated carbon 
rings.
5. Concerning the nitrogen-
containing bases that 
participate in nucleotides, 
what is the difference 
between DNA and RNA?

Biology Questions and Answers
In DNA nucleotides can be formed of 
adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) 
or guanine (G). In RNA nucleotides can 
also contain adenine (A), cytosine (C) or 
guanine (G), however, instead of 
thymine (T) there is uracil (U).
6. Which are the nucleotides 
“portions” that bind in the 
formation of nucleic acids? 
What is meant by the 5’ and 3’ 
extremities of nucleic acids?
The phosphate group of one nucleotide 
binds to the pentose of the other 
nucleotide and so on to make the 
polynucleotide chain.
Each extremity of a DNA or RNA chain 
can be distinguished from the other 
extremity according to their terminal 
chemical entity. The phosphate-ended 
extremity is called 5’-extremity and the 
pentose-ended extremity is called 
3’-extremity. So DNA or RNA chains can 
be run along the 5’-3’ way or along the 
3’-5’ way. These ways are important in 
several biological functions of DNA and 
RNA since some reactions specifically 
occur following one way or the other 
way.
7. Bacteria are prokaryotic 
cells, i.e., they do not have a 
membrane-delimited nucleus. 
Eukaryotes have cells with a 
delimited nucleus. Where in 
these types of cells can DNA 
be found?
In eukaryotic cells DNA is found within 
the cell nucleus. In prokaryotic cells 
DNA is found dispersed in the cytosol, 
the fluid space inside the cell.
Other DNA molecules can also be found 
within mitochondria and chloroplasts, 
specialized organelles of eukaryotic 
cells.
8. Who were James Watson, 
Francis Crick and Maurice 
Wilkins?
Watson (North American), Crick 
(British) and Wilkins (New Zealander) 
were the discoverers of the molecular 
structure of DNA, the double helix made 
of two polynucleotide chains paired by 
their nitrogen-containing bases. They 
won the Nobel prize in Medicine in 1962 
for the discovery.
9. According to the Watson-
Crick model how many 
polynucleotide chains does a 
DNA molecule have?
The DNA molecule is formed by two 
polynucleotide chains bound in 
antiparallel mode (5’-3’ to 3’-5’) and 
forming a helical structure.
10. What is the rule for the 
pairing of nitrogen-containing 
bases in the DNA molecule? 
And in the RNA? Is this last 
question appropriate?

Biology Questions and Answers
The rule for the pairing of nitrogen-
containing bases of the polynucleotide 
chains that form the DNA molecule is 
pyrimidine base binds to purine base, 
under the condition that thymine (T) 
binds to adenine (A) and cytosine (C) 
binds to guanine (G).
In RNA there is no binding between 
nitrogen-containing bases. That is 
because RNA is formed of only one 
polynucleotide chain; differently, DNA is 
formed of two chains. It is therefore not 
correct to question base pairing in RNA.
11. What is the numeric 
relation between pyrimidine 
and purine bases in the DNA 
molecule? Is that relation 
valid in RNA molecules?
The DNA molecule is made of two bound 
polynucleotide chains that form a helical 
structure (the double helix). The binding 
of the two chains is between their 
nitrogen-containing bases and it always 
obeys the following rules: adenine (A), 
a purine base, binds with thymine (T), a 
pyrimidine base, and guanine (G), a 
purine base, binds to cytosine (C), a 
pyrimidine base. Therefore in one 
molecule of DNA there will be the same 
number of adenine (A) and thymine (T) 
and same number of cytosine (C) and 
guanine (G). The quantities of purine 
and of pyrimidine bases then will also 
be the same in a 50% proportion for 
each type. The relation A = T and C = 
G, or A/T = C/G = 1, is called Chargaff’s 
relation and the pairing rules described 
above are known as Chargaff’s rules.
In RNA there are not two nucleotide 
chains. RNA is a simple chain molecule 
and there is no necessary 
proportionality of nitrogen-containing 
bases to form it.
12. Which type of chemical 
bond maintains the pairing of 
each chain in the DNA 
molecule?
To form the DNA molecule, purine bases 
bind to pyrimidine bases by 
intermolecular bonds called hydrogen 
bonds. Hydrogen bonds occur when 
there is hydrogen near one of these 
electronegative elements: fluorine, 
oxygen or nitrogen.
In such conditions hydrogen looks like 
having lost electrons for those elements 
and a very strong polarization is 
created. The highly positive hydrogen 
attracts pairs of electrons of other 
molecules making a hydrogen bond.
13. What is the completing 
sequence of nitrogen-
containing bases for a 
AGCCGTTAAC fragment of a 
DNA chain?
TCGGCAATTG.
14. What is the name of the 
DNA duplication process? 
What is the main enzyme that 
participates in it?

Biology Questions and Answers
The process of copying, or duplication, 
of the DNA molecule is called 
replication. The enzyme that 
participates in the formation of a new 
DNA chain is the DNA polymerase. 
There are also other important enzymes 
in the replication process, the helicase, 
the gyrase and the ligase.
15. Why is it not correct to 
assert that DNA self-
replicates?
DNA is not completely autonomous in its 
duplication process because the 
replication does not occur without 
enzymatic activity. So it is not entirely 
correct to assert that DNA self-
replicates.
16. How do the two 
complementary nucleotide 
chains of the DNA facilitate 
the replication process of the 
molecule?
The fact that the DNA molecule is made 
of two polynucleotide chains whose 
nitrogen-containing bases form 
hydrogen bonds facilitates the 
duplication of the molecule. During the 
DNA replication, the binding of the two 
chains is broken and each of them 
serves as a template for the formation 
of a new nucleotide sequence along it, 
with the help of the enzyme DNA 
polymerase and obeying the pairing rule 
A-T, C-G. At the end of the process two 
double helix of DNA are produced, each 
made of an original template chain and 
of a new synthesized polynucleotide 
chain.
17. What are the chemical 
bonds of the DNA molecule 
that are broken for the 
replication process to occur?
During the DNA replication process, 
hydrogen bonds between nitrogen-
containing bases of the polynucleotide 
chains are broken.
18. As a result of DNA 
replication two DNA molecules 
come into existence. Why is it 
not correct to assert that two 
“new” DNA molecules are 
created? What is the name 
given to the process 
concerning that fact?
During replication each chain of the DNA 
molecule acts by pairing new 
nucleotides and after the process two 
newly formed chains made with the 
union of these nucleotides appear. Then 
two DNA molecules are created, each 
with one chain from the original 
molecule and one new chain formed by 
new nucleotides. Thus it is not entirely 
correct to assert that the replication 
produces two new molecules of DNA. It 
is better to affirm that two new half-
molecules are created.
For this phenomenon DNA replication is 
called semiconservative replication.

Biology Questions and Answers
19. Does DNA replication 
occur in cell division?
Yes. DNA replication occurs in mitosis as 
well in meiosis.
20. One characteristic of the 
DNA molecule is its replication 
capability. What are the 
consequences of failures 
during DNA replication?
Ideally a DNA molecule should replicate 
in a perfect way. Sometimes however 
failures in the duplication occur, with 
alteration (deletion, addition or 
substitution) of one or more nucleotides 
in the molecule.
Those mistakes, or mutations, therefore 
make changes in the protein synthesis 
process too. For example, the 
production of an important protein for 
cells or tissues may be suppressed, new 
utile or inutile proteins can be created, 
etc. The mistake in the DNA duplication 
and the resulting production of altered 
genetic material are some of the main 
creative forces for the biological 
evolution and the diversity of species.
21. Mistakes may happen 
during every copying process. 
The same is true for DNA 
replication. Are there 
correction systems in cells 
that try to fix those mistakes? 
Under which situation are the 
mistakes carried only by the 
individual owner of the cell 
within which the mistake has 
occurred and in which 
situation are they transmitted 
to other individuals?
The cell is equipped with an enzymatic 
system that tries to fix mistakes of the 
DNA replication process. This system 
however is not completely efficient.
DNA replication mistakes are kept in the 
original individual where the failure 
occurred when the phenomenon affects 
somatic cells. If a replication mistake 
occurs in the formation of a germline 
cell (e.g., in gametes) the DNA 
alteration may be transmitted to the 
offspring of the individual.
22. Where can RNA be found 
within cells?
In the eukaryote cell nucleus RNA can 
be found dispersed in the nuclear fluid, 
along with DNA, and as the main 
constituent of the nucleolus. In cytosol 
(in eukaryotes or in bacteria) RNA 
molecules can be found free, as 
structural constituent of ribosomes 
(organelles specialized in protein 
synthesis) or even associated to them in 
the process of making proteins.

Mitochondria and chloroplasts also have 
their own DNA and RNA.
23. Does RNA molecule have 
two polynucleotide chains like 
DNA?
Only DNA has two polynucleotide 
chains. RNA is formed by just one 
polynucleotide chain.
24. What is the production of 
RNA called and what is the 
enzyme that catalyzes the 
process?
The making of RNA from information 
contained in DNA is called transcription. 
The enzyme that catalyzes the process 
is the RNA polymerase.
25. What are similarities and 
differences between the 
transcription process and the 
replication processes?
A DNA polynucleotide chain serves as a 
template in replication (DNA 
duplication) as well as in transcription 
(RNA formation). In both processes the 
pairing of the two polynucleotide chains 
of the original DNA molecule is broken 
by the breaking of hydrogen bonds for 
the chains to be exposed as templates. 
The reaction is catalyzed by specific 
enzymes in transcription and in 
replication.
In replication the enzyme DNA 
polymerase catalyzes the formation of a 
new polynucleotide chain using free 
nucleotides in solution and putting them 
in the new chain according to the DNA 
template exposed and to the rule A-T, 
C-G. In transcription the enzyme RNA 
polymerase makes a new polynucletide 
chain according to the DNA template 
exposed obeying, however, the rule A-
U, C-G.
In replication the original template DNA 
chain is kept bound by hydrogen bonds 
to the newly formed DNA chain and a 
new DNA molecule is then created. In 
transcription the association between 
the template DNA chain and the newly 
formed RNA is undone and RNA 
constituted of only one polynucleotide 
chain is liberated.
26. What are the three main 
types of RNA? What is meant 
by heterogeneous RNA?
Messenger RNA, or mRNA, transfer 
RNA, or tRNA, and ribosomal RNA, or 
rRNA, are the three main types of RNA.
The newly formed RNA molecule, a 
precursor of mRNA, is called 
heterogeneous RNA (hnRNA). The 
heterogenous RNA bears portions called 
introns and portions called exons. The 
hnRNA is processed in many chemical 
steps, introns are removed and mRNA is 
created formed only of exons, the 
biologically active nucleotide sequences.

27. Concerning their biological 
function what is the difference 
between DNA and RNA?
DNA is the source of information for 
RNA production (transcription) and thus 
for protein synthesis. DNA is still the 
basis of heredity due to its replication 
capability.
The messenger RNA is the template for 
protein synthesis (translation). In this 
process tRNA and rRNA also participate 
since the first carries amino acids for 
the polypeptide chain formation and the 
second is a structural constituent of 
ribosomes (the organelles where 
proteins are made).
28. Is there any situation in 
which DNA is made based on a 
RNA template? What is the 
enzyme involved?
The process in which DNA is synthesized 
having as template a RNA chain is called 
reverse transcription. In cells infected 
by retroviruses (RNA viruses, like the 
AIDS or SARS viruses) reverse 
transcription occurs and DNA is made 
from information contained in the viral 
RNA.
Viral RNA within the host cell produces 
DNA with the help of an enzyme called 
reverse transcriptase. Based on that 
DNA the host cell then makes viral 
proteins, new viruses are assembled 
and viral replication occurs.
29. Do the phosphate and the 
pentose groups give 
homogeneity or heterogeneity 
to the nucleic acid chains? 
What about the nitrogen-
containing groups? Supported 
by that, which of those groups 
is expected to directly 
participate in the highly 
diverse and heterogeneous 
genetic coding, i.e., which of 
those groups is the basis of 
the information for protein 
production?
The phosphate and the pentose groups 
are the same in every nucleotide that 
forms the nucleic acid and so they give 
homogeneity to the molecule. The 
nitrogen-containing bases however can 
vary among adenine, thymine, cytosine, 
guanine (in DNA) and uracil (in RNA). 
These variations provide the 
heterogeneity of the nucleic acid 
molecule.
Homogeneous portions of a molecule 
seldom would store any information, by 
the same reason that a sequence of the 
same letter of the alphabet cannot 
make many words with different 
meanings. The nitrogen-containing 
bases, on the other hand, because they 
are different (four different types for 
RNA or DNA), can make different 
sequences and combinations that allow 
the diversity of the genetic code.

Biology Questions and Answers
Cell Structure
1. What is cell theory?
Cell theory asserts that the cell is the 
constituent unit of living beings.
Before the discovery of the cell, it was 
not recognized that living beings were 
made of building blocks like cells.
The cell theory is one of the basic 
theories of Biology.
2. Are there living beings 
without cells?
Viruses are considered the only living 
beings that do not have cells. Viruses 
are constituted by genetic material 
(DNA or RNA) enwrapped by a protein 
capsule. They do not have membranes 
and cell organelles nor do they have 
self-metabolism.
3. In 1665 Robert Hooke, an 
English scientist, published his 
book Micrographia, in which 
he described that pieces of 
cork viewed under the 
microscope presented small 
cavities similar to pores which 
were filled with air. Based on 
later knowledge, of what were 
the walls of those cavities 
constituted? What is the 
historical importance of that 
observation?
The walls of the cavities observed by 
Hooke were the walls of the plant cells 
that form the tissue. The observation 
led to the discovery of the cells, a fact 
only possible after the invention of the 
microscope. In that work, Hooke 
established the term “cell”, now widely 
used in Biology, to designate those 
cavities seen under the microscope.
4. What are the two big 
groups into which cells are 
classified?
Cells can be classified as eukaryotic or 
prokaryotic.
Prokaryotic cell is that without a 
delimited nucleus. Eukaryotic cells are 
those with nucleus delimited by 
membrane.

Biology Questions and Answers
5. Do bacteria cells have a 
nucleus?
In bacteria the genetic material is 
dispersed in the cytosol and there is no 
internal membrane that delimits a 
nucleus.
6. Are there any bacteria 
made of more than one cell?
There are no pluricellular bacteria. All 
bacteria are unicellular prokaryotic.
7. What is the plasma 
membrane of the cell? What 
are its main functions?
The plasma membrane is the outer 
membrane of the cell, it delimits the cell 
itself and a cell interior with specific 
conditions for the cellular function. 
Since it is selectively permeable, the 
plasma membrane has an important 
role for the passage of substances 
inwards or outwards.
8. What are the chemical 
substances that compose the 
plasma membrane?
The main constituents of the plasma 
membrane are phospholipids, proteins 
and carbohydrates. The phospholipds, 
amphipathic molecules, are regularly 
organized in the membrane according to 
their polarity: two layers of 
phospholipids form the lipid bilayer with 
the polar part of the phospholipids 
pointing to the exterior of the layer and 
the non-polar phospholipid chains in the 
interior. Proteins can be found 
embedded in the lipid bilayer and there 
are also some carbohydrates bound to 
proteins and to phospholipids in the 
outer face of the membrane.
9. What is the difference 
between plasma membrane 
and cell wall?
Plasma membrane and cell wall are not 
the same thing. Plasma membrane, also 
called cell membrane, is the outer 
membrane common to all living cells 
and it is made of a phospholipid bilayer, 
embedded proteins and some appended 
carbohydrates.
Because cell membranes are fragile, in 
some types of cells there are even outer 
structures that support and protect the 
membrane, like the cellulose wall of 
plant cells and the chitin wall of some 
fungi cells. Most bacteria also present 
an outer cell wall made of 
peptidoglycans and other organic 
substances.
10. What are the main 
respective constituents of cell 
walls in bacteria, protists, 
fungi and plants?
In bacteria the cell wall is made of 
peptidoglycans; among protists algae 
have cell walls made of cellulose; in 
fungi, the cell wall is made of chitin (the 
same substance that makes the

exoskeleton of arthropods); in plants, 
the cell wall is made of cellulose too.
11. Do membranes form only 
the outer wrapping of cells?
Lipid membranes do not form only the 
outer cover of cells. Cell organelles, 
such as the Golgi complex, 
mitochondria, chloroplasts, lysosomes, 
the endoplasmic reticula and the 
nucleus, are delimited by membranes 
too.
12. Which type of cell came 
first in evolution - the 
eukaryotic cell or the 
prokaryotic cell?
This is an interesting problem of 
biological evolution. The most accepted 
hypothesis asserts that the more simple 
cell, the prokaryotic cell, appeared 
earlier in evolution than the more 
complex eukaryotic cell. The 
endosymbiotic hypothesis, for example, 
affirms that aerobic eukaryotic cells 
appeared from the mutualist ecological 
interaction between aerobic prokaryotes 
and primitive anaerobic eukaryotes.
13. Concerning the presence 
of the nucleus what is the 
difference between animal 
and bacterial cells?
Animal cells (cells of living beings of the 
kingdom Animalia) have an interior 
membrane that delimits a cell nucleus 
and thus they are eukaryotic cells; in 
these cells the genetic material is 
located within the nucleus. Bacterial 
cells (cells of living beings of the 
kingdom Monera) do not have organized 
cellular nuclei and so they are 
prokaryotic cells and their genetic 
material is found dispersed in the 
cytosol.
14. What are the three main 
parts of a eukaryotic cell?
The eukaryotic cell can be divided into 
two main portions: the cell membrane 
that separates the intracellular space 
from the outer space physically 
delimiting the cell; the cytoplasm, the 
interior portion filled with cytosol (the 
aqueous fluid inside the cell); and the 
nucleus, the membrane-delimited 
internal region that contains the genetic 
material.
15. What are the main 
structures within the cell 
nucleus?
Within the cell nucleus the main 
structures are: the nucleolus, an 
optically dense region, spherical shaped, 
where there are concentrated ribosomal 
RNA (rRNA) associated to proteins 
(there may be more than one nucleolus 
in a nucleus); the chromatin, made of 
DNA molecules dispersed in the nuclear 
matrix during the cell interphase; the 
karyotecha, or nuclear membrane, the 
membrane that delimits the nucleus.

16. What are the substances 
that constitute the chromatin? 
What is the difference 
between chromatin and 
chromosome?
The chromatin, dispersed in the 
nucleus, is a set of filamentous DNA 
molecules associated to nuclear proteins 
called histones. Each DNA filament is a 
double helix of DNA and thus a 
chromosome.
17. What is the fluid that fills 
the nucleus called?
The aqueous fluid that fills the nuclear 
region is called karyolymph, or 
nucleoplasm. In the fluid there are 
proteins, enzymes and other important 
substances for the nuclear metabolism.
18. Of what substances is the 
nucleolus made? Is there a 
membrane around the 
nucleolus?
Nucleolus is a region within the nucleus 
made of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and 
proteins. It is not delimited by 
membrane.
19. What is the name of the 
membrane that delimits the 
nucleus? To which component 
of the cell structure is that 
membrane contiguous?
The nuclear membrane is also called 
karyotheca. The nuclear membrane is 
continuous to the endoplasmic reticulum 
membrane.
20. What are the main 
cytoplasmic structures 
present in animal cells?
The main cytoplasmic structures of the 
cell are the centrioles, the cytoskeleton, 
lysosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, 
the Golgi apparatus, the endoplasmic 
reticula and ribosomes.
21. What are cytoplasmic 
inclusions?
Cytoplasmic inclusions are cytoplasmic 
molecular aggregates, such as 
pigments, organic polymers and 
crystals. They are not considered cell 
organelles.
Fat droplets and glycogen granules are 
examples of cytoplasmic inclusions.

Biology Questions and Answers
22. Where in the cell can 
ribosomes be found? What is 
the main biological function of 
ribosomes?
Ribosomes can be found free in the 
cytoplasm, adhered to the outer side of 
the nuclear membrane or associated to 
the endoplasmic reticulum membrane 
defining the rough endoplasmic 
reticulum. Ribosomes are the structures 
where protein synthesis takes place.
23. What is the difference 
between smooth and rough 
endoplasmic reticulum?
The endoplasmic reticulum is a delicate 
membranous structure contiguous to 
the nuclear membrane and present in 
the cytoplasm. It forms an extensive 
net of channels throughout the cell and 
is classified into rough or smooth types.
The rough endoplasmic reticulum has a 
great number of ribosomes attached to 
the external side of its membrane. The 
smooth endoplasmic reticulum does not 
have ribosomes attached to its 
membrane.
The main functions of the rough 
endoplasmic reticulum are synthesis 
and storage of proteins made in the 
ribosomes. The smooth endoplasmic 
reticulum plays a role in the lipid 
synthesis and, in muscle cells, it is 
important in the conduction of the 
contraction stimulus.
24. A netlike membranous 
complex of superposed flat 
saccules with vesicles 
detaching from the 
extremities seen in electronic 
microscopy. What is the 
observed structure? What is 
its biological function?
What is being observed is the Golgi 
complex, or Golgi apparatus. This 
cytoplasmic organelle is associated with 
chemical processing and modification of 
proteins made by the cell and with 
storage and branding of these proteins 
for posterior use or secretion. Vesicles 
seen under the electronic microscope 
contain material already processed, 
ready to be exported (secreted) by the 
cell. The vesicles detach from the Golgi 
apparatus, travel across the cytoplasm 
and fuse with the plasma membrane 
then secreting their substances to the 
exterior.
25. On which organelle of the 
cell structure does 
intracellular digestion 
depend? What is the chemical 
content of those organelles?
Intracellular digestion occurs by the 
action of lysosomes. Lysosomes have 
digestive enzymes (hydrolases) that are 
made in the rough endoplasmic 
reticulum and stored in the Golgi 
apparatus. Lysosomes are hydrolase-
containing vesicles that detach from the 
Golgi apparatus.

Biology Questions and Answers
26. Why are lysosomes known 
as “the cleaners” of the cell 
waste?
Lysosomes carry out autophagic and 
heterophagic digestion: autophagic 
digestion by digesting residual 
substances from the cellular 
metabolism; heterophagic digestion by 
digesting substances that enter the cell. 
Lysosomes enfold the substances to be 
degraded forming digestive vacuoles, or 
residual vacuoles, that later migrate 
toward the plasma membrane fusing 
with it and liberating (exocytosis) the 
digested material to the exterior.

27. Which are the cell 
organelles that participate in 
cell division and in the 
formation of cillia and flagella 
of some eukaryotic cells?
The organelles that participate in the 
cell division and in the formation of cilia 
and flagella of some eukaryotic cells are 
the centrioles. Some cells have cillia 
(paramecium, the bronchial ciliated 
epithelium, etc.) or flagella (flagellate 
protists, sperm cells, etc.); these cell 
structures are composed of 
microtubules originated from the 
centrioles. Centrioles also make the 
aster microtubules that are very 
important for cell division.
28. What are the 
morphological, chemical and 
functional similarities and 
differences between 
lysosomes and peroxisomes?
Similarities: lysosomes and peroxisomes 
are small membranous vesicles that 
contain enzymes and enclose residual 
substances from internal or external 
origin degrading them. Differences: 
lysosomes have digestive enzymes 
(hydrolases) that break substances to 
be digested into small molecules; 
peroxisomes contain enzymes that 
degrade mainly long-chained fatty acids 
and amino acids and that inactivate 
toxic agents including ethanol; within 
peroxisomes there is the enzyme 
catalase, responsible for the oxidation of 
organic compounds by hydrogen 
peroxide (H2O2) and, when this 
substance is in excess, by the 
degradation of the peroxide into water 
and molecular oxygen.
29. What are mitochondria? 
What is the basic morphology 
of these organelles and in 
which cells can they be found?
Mitochondria are the organelles in which 
the most important part of the cellular 
respiration occurs: the ATP production.
Mitochondria are organelles delimited by 
two lipid membranes. The inner 
membrane invaginates to the interior of 
the organelle forming cristae that 
delimitate the internal space known as 
mitochondrial matrix and where 
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), 
mitochondrial RNA (mt RNA),

Biology Questions and Answers
mitochondrial ribosomes and respiratory 
enzymes can be found. Mitochondria are 
numerous in eukaryotic cells and they 
are even more abundant in those cells 
that use more energy, like muscle cells. 
Because they have their own DNA, RNA 
and ribosomes, mitochondria can self-
replicate.
30. Why can mitochondria be 
considered the power plants 
of the aerobic cells?
Mitochondria are the “power plants” of 
aerobic cells because within them the 
final stages of the cellular respiration 
process occurs. Cellular respiration is 
the process of using organic molecule 
(mainly glucose) and oxygen to produce 
carbon dioxide and energy. The energy 
is stored in the form of ATP (adenosine 
triphosphate) molecules and later used 
in other cellular metabolic reactions. In 
mitochondria the two last steps of the 
cellular respiration take place: the Krebs 
cycle and the respiratory chain.
31. What is the endosymbiotic 
hypothesis about the origin of 
mitochondria? What are the 
molecular facts that support 
the hypothesis? To which 
other cellular organelles can 
the hypothesis also be 
applied?
It is presumed that mitochondria were 
primitive aerobic prokaryotes that were 
engulfed in mutualism by primitive 
anaerobic eukaryotes, receiving 
protection from these beings and 
offering energy to them. This hypothesis 
is called the endosymbiotic hypothesis 
on the origin of mitochondria.
The hypothesis is strengthened by some 
molecular evidence such as the fact that 
mitochondria have their own 
independent DNA and protein synthesis 
machinery, with their own RNA and 
ribosomes, and that they can self-
replicate.
The endosymbiotic theory can be 
applied to chloroplasts too. It is 
supposed that these organelles were 
primitive photosynthetic prokaryotes 
because they have their own DNA, RNA 
and ribosomes and they can self-
replicate too.
32. What are the main 
components of the 
cytoskeleton?
The cytoskeleton is a network of very 
small tubules and filaments distributed 
throughout the cytoplasm of eukaryotic 
cells. It is made of microtubules, 
microfilaments and intermediate 
filaments.
Microtubules are formed by molecules of 
a protein called tubulin. Microfilaments 
are made of actin, the same protein that 
participates in the contraction of muscle 
cells. Intermediate filaments are made 
of protein too.
33. What are the functions of 
the cytoskeleton?

Biology Questions and Answers
As the name indicates, the cytoskeleton 
is responsible for the support of the 
normal shape of the cell; it also acts as 
a facilitator for substance transport 
across the cell and for the movement of 
cellular organelles. For example, the 
sliding between actin-containing 
filaments and the protein myosin 
creates pseudopods. In cells of the 
phagocytic defense system, like 
macrophages, cytoskeleton is 
responsible for the plasma membrane 
projections that engulf the external 
material to be interiorized and attacked 
by the cell.
34. What are chloroplasts? 
What are the main function of 
chloroplasts?
Chloroplasts are organelles present in 
the cytoplasm of plant and algae cells. 
Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have 
two boundary membranes and many 
internal membranous sacs. Within the 
organelle there are DNA, RNA and 
ribosomes and also the pigment 
chlorophyll, responsible for absorption 
of photic energy that is used in 
photosynthesis.
The main function of chloroplasts is 
photosynthesis: the production of highly 
energetic organic molecules (glucose) 
from carbon dioxide, water and light.
35. What is the molecule 
responsible for the absorption 
of photic energy for 
photosynthesis? Where is that 
molecule located in 
photosynthetic cells?
The chlorophyll molecules are 
responsible for the absorption of light 
energy for photosynthesis. These 
molecules are found in the internal 
membranes of chloroplasts.
36. What are the colors (of the 
electromagnetic spectrum) 
absorbed by plants? What 
would happen to 
photosynthesis if the green 
light waves that reach a 
vegetable were blocked?
Chlorophyll absorbs all other colors of 
the electromagnetic spectrum but it 
practically does not absorb the green. 
The green color is reflected and such 
reflection provides the characteristic 
color of plants. If the green light that 
reaches a plant is blocked and exposure 
of the plant to other colors is 
maintained there would be no harm to 
the photosynthesis process. Apparent 
paradox: the green light is not 
important for photosynthesis.
There is a difference between the 
optimum color frequency for the two 
main types of chlorophyll, the 
chlorophyll A and the chlorophyll B. 
Chlorophyll A has an absorption peak at 
approximately 420 nm wavelength 
(anil) and chlorophyll B has its major

absorption in 450 nm wavelength 
(blue).
37. What is the path followed 
by the energy absorbed by 
plants to be used in 
photosynthesis?
The energy source of photosynthesis is 
the sun, the unique and central star of 
our planetary system. In photosynthesis 
the solar energy is transformed into 
chemical energy, the energy of the 
chemical bonds of the produced glucose 
molecules (and of the released 
molecular oxygen). The energy of 
glucose is then stored as starch (a 
glucose polymer) or it is used in the 
cellular respiration process and 
transferred to ATP molecules. ATP is 
consumed in metabolic processes that 
spend energy (for example, in active 
transport across membranes).
38. Of what substance is the 
plant cell wall made? Of which 
monomer is it made?
The plant cell wall is made of cellulose. 
Cellulose is a polymer whose monomer 
is glucose. There are other polymers of 
glucose, like glycogen and starch.
39. What is the function of the 
plant cell wall?
The plant cell wall has structural and 
protective functions. It plays an 
important role in the constraint of the 
cell size, preventing the cell to break 
when it absorbs a lot of water.
40. What are plant cell 
vacuoles? What are their 
functions? What is the 
covering membrane of the 
vacuoles called?
Plant cell vacuoles are cell structures 
delimited by membranes within which 
there is an aqueous solution made of 
various substances like carbohydrates 
and proteins. In young plant cells many 
small vacuoles can be seen; within adult 
cells the most part of the internal area 
of the cell is occupied by a central 
vacuole.
The main function of the vacuoles is the 
osmotic balance of the intracellular 
space. They act as “an external space” 
inside the cell. Vacuoles absorb or 
release water in response to the cellular 
metabolic necessities by increasing or 
lowering the concentration of osmotic 
particles dissolved in the cytosol. 
Vacuoles also serve as a storage place 
for some substances.
The membrane that delimits the 
vacuoles is called tonoplast, named 
after the osmotic function of the 
structure.

Biology Questions and Answers
Cell Membrane
1. What is a membrane?
Membrane is any delicate sheet that 
separates one region from another 
blocking or permitting (selectively or 
completely) the passage of substances. 
The skin, for example, can be 
considered a membrane that separates 
the exterior from the interior of the 
body; cellophane, used in chemical 
laboratories to separate solutions, acts 
as a membrane too.
2. Concerning their 
permeability how are 
membranes classified?
Membranes can be classified as 
impermeable, permeable, 
semipermeable or selectively 
permeable.
An impermeable membrane is that 
through which no substance can pass. 
Semipermeable membranes are those 
that let only solvents, like water, to 
pass through it. Permeable membranes 
are those that let solvent and solutes, 
like ions and molecules, to pass across 
it. There are also selectively permeable 
membranes, i.e., membranes that 
besides allowing the passage of solvent, 
let only some specific solutes to pass 
while blocking others.
3. What is diffusion?
Diffusion is the spreading of substance 
molecules from a region where the 
substance is more concentrated to 
another region where it is less 
concentrated. For example, during the 
boiling of water in a kitchen gaseous 
water particles tend to uniformly spread 
in the air by diffusion.
4. What is meant by 
concentration gradient? Is it 
correct to refer to 
“concentration gradient of 
water”?
Concentration gradient is the difference 
of concentration of a substance between 
two regions.
Concentration is a term used to 
designate the quantity of a solute 
divided by the total quantity of the 
solution. Since water in general is the 
solvent in this situation it is not correct 
to refer to “concentration of water” in a 
given solution.
5. What is the difference 
between osmosis and 
diffusion?
Osmosis is the phenomenon of 
movement of solvent particles (in 
general, water) from a region of lower 
solute concentration to a region of 
higher solute concentration. Diffusion, 
on the other hand, is the movement of 
solutes from a region of higher solute

Biology Questions and Answers
concentration to a region of lower solute 
concentration.
One can consider osmosis as movement 
of water (solvent) and diffusion as 
movement of solutes, both 
concentration gradient-driven.
6. What is osmotic pressure?
Osmotic pressure is the pressure 
created in an aqueous solution by a 
region of lower solute concentration 
upon a region of higher solute 
concentration forcing the passage of 
water from that to this more 
concentrated region. The intensity of 
the osmotic pressure (in units of 
pressure) is equal to the pressure that 
is necessary to apply in the solution to 
prevent its dilution by the entering of 
water by osmosis.
It is possible to apply in the solution 
another pressure in the contrary way to 
the osmotic pressure, like the 
hydrostatic pressure of the liquid or the 
atmospheric pressure. In plant cells, for 
example, the rigid cell wall makes 
opposite pressure against the tendency 
of water to enter when the cell is put 
under a hypotonic environment. 
Microscopically, the pressure contrary to 
the osmotic pressure does not forbid 
water to pass through a semipermeable 
membrane but it creates a 
compensatory flux of water in the 
opposite way.
7. Can solutions with the same 
concentration of different 
solutes have different osmotic 
pressures?
The osmotic pressure of a solution does 
not depend on the nature of the solute, 
it depends only on the quantity of 
molecules (particles) in relation to the 
total solution volume. Solutions with 
same concentration of particles even 
containing different solutes exert the 
same osmotic pressure.
Even when the solution contains a 
mixture of different solutes its osmotic 
pressure depends only on its total 
particle concentration regardless of the 
nature of the solutes.
8. How are solutions classified 
according to their comparative 
tonicity?
Comparative to another, a solution can 
be hypotonic (or hyposmotic), isotonic 
(or isosmotic) or hypertonic (or 
hyperosmotic).
When a solution is less concentrated 
than another the adjective hypotonic is 
given and the more concentrated is 
called hypertonic. When two compared 
solutions have the same concentration 
both receive the adjective isotonic. So 
this classification makes sense only for 
comparison of solutions.

9. Concerning permeability 
what type of membrane is the 
cell membrane?
The cell membrane is a selectively 
permeable membrane, i.e., it allows the 
passage of water and some selected 
solutes.
10. What are the basic 
constituents of the cell 
membrane?
The cell membrane is formed of lipids, 
proteins and carbohydrates.
The membrane lipids are phospholipids, 
a special type of lipid to which one 
extremity a phosphate group is bound 
thus assigning electrical charge to this 
region of the molecule. Since 
phospholipids have one electrically 
charged extremity and a long neutral 
organic chain they can organize 
themselves in two layers of associated 
molecules: the hydrophilic portion 
(polar) of each layer faces outwards in 
contact with water (a polar molecule 
too) of the extracellular and the 
intracellular space and the hydrophobic 
chains (non polar) face inwards isolated 
from the water. Because this type of 
membrane is made of two phospolipid 
layers it is also called a bilipid 
membrane.
Membrane proteins are embedded and 
dispersed in the compact bilipid 
structure. Carbohydrates appear in the 
outer surface of the membrane 
associated to some of those proteins 
under the form of glycoproteins or 
bound to phospholipids forming 
glycolipids. The membrane 
carbohydrates form the glycocalix of the 
membrane.
This description (with further 
explanations) is known as the fluid 
mosaic model about the structure of the 
cell membrane.
11. What are the respective 
functions of phospholipids, 
proteins and carbohydrates of 
the cell membrane?
Membrane phospholipids have a 
structural function, they form the bilipid 
membrane that constitutes the cell 
membrane itself.
Membrane proteins have several 
specialized functions. Some of them are 
channels for substances to pass through 
the membrane, others are receptors 
and signalers of information, others are 
enzymes, others are cell identifiers 
(cellular labels) and there are still those 
that participate in the adhesion 
complexes between cells or between the 
internal surface of the membrane and 
the cytosketeleton.
Membrane carbohydrates, associated to 
proteins or to lipids, are found in the 
outer surface of the cell membrane and 
they have in general labeling functions 
for recognition of the cell by other cells 
and substances (for example, they 
differentiate red blood cells in relation to 
the ABO blood group system), immune 
modulation functions, pathogen 
sensitization functions, etc.

Biology Questions and Answers
12. What are differentiations 
of the cell membrane?
In some types of cells, the cell 
membrane presents differentiations that 
are necessary for the specific functions 
of the cells. The main differentiations 
are the microvilli and the structures for 
reinforcement of adhesion or union 
between cells (cell junctions).
Microvilli are multiple external 
projections of the membrane resembling 
glove fingers. This differentiation is 
found in cells of tissues where it is 
advantageous to increase the size of the 
surface area in contact with the 
exterior, for example, in the enteric 
(intestinal) epithelium for absorption of 
nutrients.
Membrane differentiations for 
reinforcement of adhesion between cells 
occur mainly in epithelial tissues where 
the need for coverage and 
impermeability requires cells to be 
“glued” to neighboring cells. These 
differentiations can be interdigitations, 
desmosomes, tight junctions (zonula 
occludens), zonula adherens (adherens 
junctions) and gap junctions.
13. What is the relationship 
between concentration 
gradient and active and 
passive transport?
Passive transport is the movement of 
substances across membranes in favor 
of their concentration gradient, i.e., 
from a more concentrated region to a 
less concentrated region. Active 
transport, on the other hand, is the 
transport of substances across 
membranes against their concentration 
gradient, from a less concentrated to a 
more concentrated region. In passive 
transport, because it is spontaneous, 
there is no energy spent; the active 
transport however requires energy 
(work) to occur.
Active transport works to maintain or 
increase the concentration gradient of a 
substance between two regions while 
passive transport acts in a manner to 
reduce the concentration gradient.
14. What are the three main 
types of passive transport?
The three main types of passive 
transport are simple diffusion, osmosis 
and facilitated diffusion.
15. What is the energy source 
used in active transport 
through biological 
membranes?
The energy necessary for active 
transport (against the concentration 
gradient of the transported substance) 
to occur comes from ATP molecules. The 
active transportation uses chemical 
energy from ATP.
16. What is the difference 
between simple and facilitated 
diffusion? Facilitated by which 
type of molecule does the 
term “facilitated” mean?
www.biology-questions-and-answers.com

Transaction ID: 4KS71350WY6468607

Biology Questions and Answers
Simple diffusion is the direct passage of 
substances across the membrane in 
favor of their concentration gradient. In 
facilitated diffusion the movement of 
substances is also in favor of their 
concentration gradient but the 
substances move bound to specific 
molecules that act as “permeabilizers”, 
i.e., facilitators of their passage through 
the membrane.
17. How does the intensity of 
simple diffusion vary in 
relation to the concentration 
gradient of the moved 
substance?
The higher the concentration gradient of 
a substance the more intense its simple 
diffusion will be. If the concentration 
gradient diminishes the intensity of 
simple diffusion diminishes too.
18. How does the intensity of 
facilitated diffusion vary in 
relation to the concentration 
of the moved substance? What 
is the limiting factor?
Like simple diffusion facilitated diffusion 
is more intense when the concentration 
gradient of the substance increases and 
less intense when the gradient lessens. 
In facilitated diffusion however there is 
a limiting factor: the quantity of the 
permeases that facilitate the transport 
through the membrane. Even in a 
situation in which the concentration 
gradient of the diffusing substance 
increases, if there are not enough 
permeases to perform the transport 
there will be no increase in the intensity 
of the diffusion. This situation is called 
saturation of the transport proteins and 
it represents the point at which the 
maximum transport capacity of the 
substance across the membrane is 
achieved.
19. Without saturation of 
transport proteins and under 
the same concentration 
gradient how can the speed of 
simple diffusion be compared 
to the speed of facilitated 
diffusion?
The action of facilitator proteins in 
facilitated diffusion makes this type of 
diffusion faster than simple diffusion 
under equal concentration gradients of 
the moved substance.
20. How does facilitated 
diffusion present similarities 
with enzymatic chemical 
reactions?
One of the main examples of facilitated 
transport is the entrance of glucose 
from the blood into cells. Glucose from 
blood binds to specific permeases 
(hexose-transporting permeases) 
present in the cell membrane and by 
diffusion facilitated by these proteins it 
enters the cell to play its metabolic 
functions.
Facilitated diffusion resembles chemical 
catalysis because the transported 
substances bind to permeases like 
substrates bind to enzymes and in

addition, after one transport job is 
concluded, the permease is not 
consumed and can perform other 
successive transports.
21. What are some examples 
of biological activities in which 
osmosis plays an important 
role?
Hemolysis (destruction of red blood 
cells) by entrance of water, the hydric 
regulation in plants and the entrance of 
water in the xylem of vascular plants 
are all examples of biological 
phenomena caused by osmosis.
Excessive dilution of the blood plasma 
causes, by osmosis, the entrance of too 
much water into red blood cells and 
then the destruction of these cells 
(hemolysis). Osmosis is also the main 
process for maintenance of the flaccid, 
turgid or plasmolytic states of plant 
cells. Osmosis is one of the forces 
responsible for the entrance of water 
into plant roots since root cells are 
hypertonic in comparison to the soil.
22. What do facilitated 
diffusion and active transport 
have in common? What are 
the differences between 
them?
Facilitated diffusion can be confused 
with active transport because in both 
processes there is participation of 
membrane proteins.
In active transport however the 
transported substance moves against its 
concentration gradient and with energy 
spent. Facilitated diffusion is a passive 
transport in favor of the concentration 
gradient and it does not require energy.
23. Which are the molecules 
that make possible active 
transport through 
membranes?
Active transport is made by specific 
membrane proteins. These proteins are 
called “pumps” because they “pump” 
the moving substance through the 
membrane using energy from ATP 
molecules.
24. How does the sodium-
potassium pump present in 
the cell membrane work? 
What is the importance of this 
protein for the cell?
The sodium-potassium pump is the 
transport protein that maintains the 
concentration gradient of these ions 
between the intra and the extracellular 
spaces. This protein is phosphorylated 
in each pumping cycle and then it 
pumps three sodium ions outside the 
cell and puts two potassium ions 
inwards. The phosphorylation is made 
by the binding of a phosphate donated 
by one ATP molecule that then is 
converted into ADP (adenosine 
diphosphate).

also known as sodium-potassium

ATPase, is fundamental to keep the 
characteristic negative electrical charge 
in the intracellular side of the 
membrane of the resting cell and to 
create adequate conditions of sodium 
and potassium concentrations inside 
and outside the cell to maintain the 
cellular metabolism.
25. What is mass 
transportation across the cell 
membrane?
Mass transportation is the entrance or 
the exiting of substances in or from the 
cell engulfed by portions of membrane. 
The fusion of internal substance-
containing membranous vesicles with 
the cell membrane is called exocytosis. 
The entrance of substances into the cell 
after they have been engulfed by 
projections of the membrane is called 
endocytosis.
26. What are the two main 
types of endocytosis?
Endocytosis is the entrance of material 
in the cell engulfed by portions of the 
cell membrane.
Endocytosis can be classified as 
pinocytosis or phagocytosis. In 
pinocytosis small particles on the 
external surface of the membrane 
stimulate the invagination of the 
membrane inwards and vesicles full of 
that particles then detach from the 
membrane and enter the cytoplasm. In 
phagocytosis bigger particles on the 
external surface of the membrane 
induce the projection of pseudopods 
outwards enclosing the particles; the 
vesicle then detaches from the 
membrane and enters the cytoplasm 
receiving the name phagosome.
27. How does the plant cell 
wall react when it is placed 
under hypotonic medium?
The plant cell wall (the covering of the 
cell external to the cell membrane) is 
made of cellulose, a polymer of glucose.
When the cell is put under hypotonic 
medium it absorbs too much water 
through osmosis. In that situation the 
cell wall pressure acts to compensate 
the osmotic pressure thus forbidding 
excessive increase of the cellular 
volume and the cell lysis.
28. What is meant by suction 
force of the plant cell? Does 
the suction force facilitate or 
make difficult the entrance of 
water into the cell?
The suction force (SF) is the osmotic 
pressure of the plant cell vacuole, i.e., 
of the vacuolar internal solution.
Since the vacuolar solution is hypertonic 
in comparison to cytosol it attracts 
water thus increasing the cytosol 
concentration. With the osmotic action 
of the vacuole the cytosol becomes 
hypertonic in relation to the exterior and 
more water enters the cell.

Biology Questions and Answers
29. What is the wall resistance 
of plant cells? Does this 
resistance facilitate or make 
difficult the entrance of water 
into the cell?
Wall resistance, or turgor pressure (TP), 
is the pressure made by the distension 
of the plant cell wall in opposition to the 
increase of the cell volume. The wall 
resistance works against the entrance of 
water in the cell, i.e., it acts forcing the 
exiting of water and compensating the 
entrance of the solvent by osmosis.
30. What does the formula 
DPD = SF – TP mean?
DPD is the abbreviation of diffusion 
pressure deficit, SF (suction force) is the 
vacuolar osmotic pressure and TP is the 
turgor pressure.
The difference between SF and TP 
determines whether water tends or not 
to enter the cell. If SF > TP, DPD > 0 
and water tends to enter the cell by 
osmosis. If TP > SF, DPD < 0 and water 
cannot enter the cell by osmosis.
31. What are the values of 
DPD for plant cells under 
hypertonic, isotonic and 
hypotonic media?
In plant cells under hypertonic medium 
there is loss of water for the exterior, SF 
> 0 (the vacuolar pressure is high 
because it is concentrated) and TP = 0 
(there is no distension of the cell wall 
since the cellular volume is reduced) so 
DPD = SF. These cells are called 
plasmolysed cells, situation 
characterized by the retraction of the 
cell membrane that detach from the cell 
wall.
In plant cells under isotonic medium 
there is no increase of the internal 
water volume, SF > 0 and TP = 0 (since 
the cell wall is not distended). The cell 
membrane slightly touches the cell wall 
and in this situation the cell is called a 
flaccid cell.
In plant cells under hypotonic medium 
there is tendency of water to enter, SF 
= TP (since the osmotic pressure is 
totally compensated by the distension of 
the cell wall) and DPD = 0. The cell that 
has expanded itself to this point is 
called a turgid cell.
32. What is the formula of the 
DPD for withered (shrunken) 
plant cells? How is that 
situation possible?
Withered plant cells are those that have 
shrunk due to loss of water by 
evaporation without enough 
replacement. In this situation the cell 
membrane retracts and detaches from 
the cell wall. The cell wall moreover 
expands in length to stimulate the 
entrance of water making TP < 0. Since 
DPD = SF – TP and TP is negative (< 0) 
its formula becomes DPD = SF + |TP|.
33. What is deplasmolysis of 
plant cells?

The plant cell when placed under 
hypertonic medium loses a great 
amount of water and its cell membrane 
detaches from the cell wall. In that 
situation the cell is called a plasmolysed 
cell. When the plasmolysed cell is placed 
under hypertonic medium it absorbs 
water and becomes a turgid cell. This 
phenomenon is called deplasmolysis.
34. Why are salt and sugar 
used in the production of dried 
meat and dried fruits?
Substances that maintain a highly 
hypertonic environment, like sugar and 
salt, are used in the production of dried 
meat, fruits or fish (for example, cod) 
because the material to be conserved is 
then dehydrated and the resulting 
dryness prevents the growth of 
populations of decomposer beings (since 
these beings also lose water and die).

Biology Questions and Answers
Cytoskeleton and 
Cell Movement
1. What is a cytoskeleton? 
What are its main constituents 
in animal cells?
Cytoskeleton is the cytoplasmic 
structure that supports the cell, keeps 
its shape and fixates and moves the cell 
organelles. It is made of an extensive 
network of fibers dispersed in the 
cytoplasm and anchored in the plasma 
membrane. Its components are 
microtubules, microfilaments and 
intermediate filaments.
2. Of which substance are 
microtubules made? In which 
structures and cellular 
processes do microtubules 
participate?
Microtubules are made of consecutive 
dimers of the protein tubulin (each 
dimer has an alpha and a beta tubulin 
associated). Microtubules participate in 
cell division, they are constituents of 
cilia and flagella and they also form the 
centrioles.
3. Of which substance are 
microfilaments made? What 
are the properties of these 
elements that give motility to 
cells?
Microfilaments are made of actin (a 
protein). The contractile association of 
actin with myosin and other cytoplasmic 
proteins give to microfilaments the 
ability to promote cell movement.
4. What are cell movements? 
How are these movements 
created?
Cell movements are movements 
performed by cell structures, like the 
movements of cilia and flagella, the 
pseudopod movements (in amoeba, 
macrophages, etc.), the cyclosis of the 
cytoplasm and the sarcomere 
contraction in muscle cells.
Cell movements can be created by the 
cytoskeleton action, by differences of 
viscosity among cytoplasmic regions 
and by intracellular contraction systems.
5. What are cilia and flagella? 
How do these structures 
acquire movement? What are 
some examples of ciliated and 
flagellated cells in humans?
Cilia and flagella are structures found in 
some prokaryotes as well in some 
eukaryotic cells. They play defense, 
nutrition and movement roles for the

cell. In eukaryotic cells of protists and 
animals they originate from centrioles 
that migrate towards the plasma 
membrane and differentiate into 
structures projected outside the cell. 
Each cilium or flagellum is made of nine 
peripheral pairs of microtubules and one 
central pair all covered by membrane. 
(In bacteria, flagella are made of a 
protein named flagellin and there can 
also be fimbria made of pilin.)
In the fixation base of each cilium or 
flagellum in the plasma membrane 
there are proteins that work as 
molecular motors providing movement 
for these structures with energy 
spending. Due to this energy spending 
ciliated or flagellated eukaryotic cells 
have a large number of mitochondria.
In humans ciliated cells can be found, 
for example, in the bronchial and 
tracheal epithelium. In these tissues the 
cilia have the defensive function of 
sweeping mucous and foreign 
substances that enter the airways. 
Sperm cells are a typical example of 
flagellated cells, their flagellum is the 
propulsion equipment for the movement 
towards the ovule.
6. How does the amoeboid 
movement occur? What are 
examples of beings and cells 
that use such movements for 
locomotion?
Amoeboid movements are created by 
cytoplasmic movements and plasma 
membrane projections called 
pseudopods. Their formation actively 
changes the external shape of some 
portions of the cell surface making it 
move along a substratum. Pseudopods 
appear from differences of viscosity 
among neighboring regions of 
cytoplasm near the plasma membrane 
and from the contractile action of 
microfilaments.
Amoeboid movements occur, for 
example, in amoebas (a protozoan), 
organisms that use their movement to 
find food. The leukocytes, cells of the 
immune system, when attracted by 
chemical substances (immune 
mediators) use amoeboid movements to 
get out from capillaries in regions of 
tissue damage to participate in the 
inflammatory process.
7. What are some examples of 
movement created by the 
contraction of sarcomeres of 
the muscle cells?
The handling of a cup of coffee, the 
peristaltic movements of the bowels, 
the cardiac beats and even a smile are 
examples of movement created by 
contraction of the sarcomeres of the 
muscle cells. This contraction is a type 
of cell movement.
8. What is cyclosis?
Cyclosis is a type of internal cell 
movement in which an oriented flow of 
circulating material is created and 
maintained in the cytoplasm by the 
action of microfilaments. Cyclosis is 
more easily observed in plant cells.

Biology Questions and Answers
Cell Secretion
1. What is meant by cellular 
secretion?
Cell secretion is the elimination to the 
exterior of substances produced by the 
cell (for example, hormones, mucus, 
sweat, etc.)
2. Which cell organelles are 
well-developed in secretory 
cells?
In secretory cells, like the secretory 
cells of endocrine glands, organelles 
related to production, processing and 
“exportation” of substances are widely 
present and well-developed. These 
organelles are the rough endoplasmic 
reticulum and the Golgi apparatus.
The nuclear membrane of the secretory 
cells generally has more pores to allow 
the intense traffic of molecules related 
to protein synthesis between the 
cytoplasm and the nucleus.
3. How do the rough 
endoplasmic reticulum and the 
Golgi apparatus act in the 
production and releasing of 
proteins?
The rough endoplasmic reticulum has in 
its outer membrane numerous 
ribosomes, structures where translation 
of messenger RNA and protein synthesis 
occur. These proteins are stored in the 
rough endoplasmic reticulum and later 
they go to the Golgi apparatus. Within 
the Golgi apparatus proteins are 
chemically transformed and when ready 
they are put inside vesicles that detach 
from the organelle. These vesicles fuse 
with the plasma membrane (exocytosis) 
in the right place and its content is 
liberated outside the cell.
4. What are some examples of 
secretory cells?
Endocrine and exocrine pancreatic cells, 
thyroid and parathyroid endocrine cells, 
adenohypophysis, adrenal and pineal 
endocrine cells, the many types of 
gastric exocrine and endocrine cells, the 
mucus secretory cells of the lungs and 
of the bowels, the salivary gland cells, 
the lacrimal gland cells, the sebaceous 
gland cells, the secretory cells of the 
ovaries and testicles, etc., are all 
examples of secretory cells.

Biology Questions and Answers
Cell Digestion
1. What is extracellular 
digestion?
Extracellular digestion is that in which 
food breaking into utile molecules that 
can be internalized by the cell is done in 
the extracellular space, i.e., outside the 
cell. In extracellular digestion, the cells 
secret substances that break big 
molecules into smaller ones in the 
external environment. Later the cell can 
benefit from these products of 
digestion.
2. What is intracellular 
digestion?
Intracellular digestion, or cellular 
digestion, is the breaking in the interior 
of the cell of big molecules coming from 
outside or even from its own cell 
metabolism into smaller molecules. 
Products and residues of the 
intracellular digestion are used by the 
cell or excreted.
Intracellular digestion is classified into 
two types: heterophagic intracellular 
digestion and autophagic intracellular 
digestion.
3. What is the main cell 
organelle involved in cell 
digestion? What are the 
properties of that organelle 
that enable it to do the task?
The organelles responsible for 
intracellular digestion are the 
lysosomes. Lysosomes are vesicles that 
contain digestive enzymes capable of 
breaking big molecules into smaller 
ones. These vesicles fuse with others 
that carry the material to be digested 
and then digestion takes place.
4. What is heterophagic 
intracellular digestion? How is 
this process accomplished?
Heterophagic intracellular digestion is 
the breaking into smaller substances of 
external substances engulfed in the cell 
by pinocytosis or phagocytosis. 
Phagosomes or pinosomes fuse with 
lysosomes making the digestive 
vacuoles. Within the digestive vacuoles 
the molecules to be digested are 
hydrolyzed and the products of the 
digestion cross through the membrane 
and reach the cytoplasm or they are 
kept inside the vacuoles. The vacuole 
with residues from digestion is called 
residual body and by exocytosis it fuses 
with the plasma membrane and 
liberates its “waste” in the exterior 
space.

5. What is autophagic 
intracellular digestion? Why is 
this type of intracellular 
digestion intensified in an 
organism undergoing 
starvation?
Autophagic intracellular digestion is the 
cellular internal digestion of waste and 
residual materials. In general it is done 
by lysosomes.
Autophagic intracellular digestion is 
intensified in situations of starvation 
because in such condition the cell tries 
to obtain from its own constituent 
materials the nutrients necessary to 
stay alive.
6. What are some biological 
examples in which lysosomic 
enzymes play a fundamental 
role?
The remodelation of the osseous tissue, 
the function of acrosomes in sperm cells 
and the elimination of the tadpole tail 
are examples of biological processes in 
which lysosomic enzymes are key 
factors.
The bone is a tissue made of osteoblast-
containing matrix (osteoblasts are the 
secretory cells of the osseous matrix), 
osteocytes (mature bone cells) and 
osteoclasts (the remodeling cells). 
Osteoclasts are responsible for the 
continual renovation of the osseous 
tissue since their lysosomic enzymes 
digest the osseous matrix.
The sperm acrosome, for carrying 
digestive enzymes within, is responsible 
for the perfuration of the egg cell 
membrane in the fertilization process. 
The acrosome, located in the anterior 
end of the sperm cell, is a specialized 
region of the Golgi apparatus that 
accumulates a great amount of 
digestive enzymes.
In tadpoles the tail regresses while the 
organism develops into an adult frog. 
This tissue destruction is a digestion of 
the tail's own cells and extracellular 
materials and it is made by lysosomes 
and their enzymes. The complete 
digestion of a cell by its own 
mechanisms is called autolysis, a type 
of apoptosis (cell suicide).

Biology Questions and Answers
Cell Nucleus
1. What are cells with a 
delimited nucleus called ? 
What are the main elements 
of the nucleus?
Cells with delimited nucleus are called 
eukaryotic cells. Organisms composed 
of one or more eukaryotic cells are 
called eukaryotes.
The mains elements of the nucleus are 
the chromatin (made of DNA 
molecules), the nucleolus, the 
karyolymph, or nucleoplasm, and the 
nuclear membrane (or karyotheca).
2. Do all eukaryotic cells have 
nucleus and only one nucleus?
There are eukaryotic cells without a 
nucleus and others with more than one 
nucleus. Osteoclasts, the cells 
responsible for resorption of the 
osseous matrix, for example, are 
multinucleate cells; striated muscle 
fibers are multinucleate too. Red blood 
cells are an example of enucleated 
specialized cells.
3. Of which substances is 
chromatin made?
Chromatin is made of DNA molecules 
associated to proteins called histones.
4. What are heterochromatin 
and euchromatin?
Chromatin is uncondensed nuclear DNA, 
the typical DNA morphology in 
interphase (the phase of the cell cycle in 
which the cells is not dividing itself). In 
this phase of the cell cycle chromatin 
can be found as heterochromatin, more 
condensed and dark (in electronic 
microscopy) portions of DNA molecules, 
and as euchromatin, less condensed and 
lighter portions of DNA molecules.
Since it is uncondensed the euchromatin 
is the biologically active portion of the 
DNA, i.e., the region that has active 
genes to be transcripted into RNA. The 
heterochromatin represents the inactive 
portions of the DNA molecule.
5. What is the relation 
between the concepts of 
chromatin and chromosome? 
Are euchromatin and 
heterochromatin part of 
chromosomes?
Every filament of chromatin is a 
complete DNA molecule (a complete 
double helix), i.e., a complete 
chromosome. A DNA molecule may form 
euchromatin and heterochromatin 
portions thus both are part of 
chromosomes.

6. In the phase when the cell 
is not dividing (interphase) is 
there activity within the cell 
nucleus?
In the interphase there is intense 
metabolic activity in the cell nucleus: 
DNA is duplicating, euchromatin is being 
transcripted and RNA is produced.
7. How are the concepts of 
chromosome, chromatin and 
chromatids related? In which 
phase of the cell cycle does 
DNA duplicate?
Chromatin is a set of filamentous DNA 
molecules dispersed in the karyoplasm 
forming euchromatin and 
heterochromatin portions. Each 
chromatin filament is a complete 
chromosome (a DNA molecule, or 
double helix). The chromatin of the 
human somatic cell is formed by 46 
DNA molecules (22 homologous 
chromosomes and 1 pair of sex 
chromosomes).
In interphase the cell prepares itself for 
division and duplication of DNA 
molecules occurs. The duplication of 
every DNA molecule forms two identical 
DNA double helix bound by a structure 
called centromere. In this phase each 
identical chromosome of these pairs is 
called chromatid. It is also during the 
interphase that the chromatids begin to 
condensate assuming the thicker and 
shorter shape typical of chromosome 
illustrations. So the phase of the cell 
cycle in which DNA duplicates is the 
interphase.
Some Biology textbooks call the 
chromosome a unique filament of 
chromatin as well as the condensed 
structure made of two identical 
chromatids after the DNA duplication. 
Rigorously the pair of identical 
chromatids bound in the centromere are 
two copies of the same chromosome 
and therefore they are two identical 
chromosomes (and not only one).
8. What is the structure that 
maintains identical chromatids 
bound?
The structure that maintains identical 
chromatids bound is the centromere.
9. How is the chromosome 
region where the centromere 
is located called? How are 
chromosomes classified in 
relation to the position of their 
centromere?
The chromosome region where the 
centromere is located is called primary 
constriction. In microscopic view this 
region is narrower (a stricture) than 
most part of the chromosome.
According to the position of the primary 
constriction the chromosomes are 
classified as telocentric, acrocentric, 
submetacentric or metacentric.

10. What are the primary and 
the secondary constrictions of 
a chromosome? What is the 
other name given to the 
secondary constriction?
Primary constriction is the narrower 
region of a condensed chromosome 
where the centromere, the structure 
that unites identical chromatids, is 
located. Secondary constriction is a 
region similar to the primary 
constriction, narrower than the normal 
thickness of the chromosome too, and 
in general it is related to genes that 
coordinate the formation of the 
nucleolus and control the ribosomic RNA 
(rRNA) synthesis. For this reason the 
secondary contrictions (that can be one 
or more in chromosome) is called 
nucleolus organizer region (NOR).
11. What are homologous 
chromosomes? Which are the 
human cells that do not have 
homologous chromosomes?
Chromosomes contain genes (genetic 
information in the form of nucleotide 
sequences) that command the protein 
synthesis thus regulating and controlling 
the activities of the cell. In the nucleus 
of somatic cells of diploid beings every 
chromosome has its correspondent 
homologous chromosome, both 
containing alleles of the same genes 
related to same functions. This occurs 
because one chromosome of one pair 
comes from the father and the other 
comes from the mother of the 
individual. The chromosomes that form 
a pair with alleles of the same genes are 
called homologous chromosomes. In 
humans, there are 22 pairs of 
homologous chromosomes plus the pair 
of sex chromosomes (the sex 
chromosomes are partially 
homologous).
The only human cells that do not have 
homologous chromosomes are the 
gametes since during meiosis the 
homologous chromosomes are 
separated.
12. What is the difference 
between the concepts of 
karyotype and genome?
Genome is the set of DNA molecules 
that characterizes each living being or 
each species. The concept then includes 
the specific nucleotide sequence of the 
DNA molecules of each individual or 
species. Karyotype is the set of 
chromosomes of individuals of a given 
individual or species concerning 
morphology and number of each 
chromosome or pair of homologous.
13. Can two normal 
individuals of the same 
species with sexual 
reproduction have identical 
genomes and identical 
karyotypes? How is the human 
karyotype usually 
represented?
Except for clones (individuals created 
from nucleus transplantation, like the 
Dolly sheep) and monozygotic twins, it 
is very improbable the genomes of two 
individuals of the same species and

identical. Nevertheless the karyotypes 
of two normal individuals of the same 
species and of the same sex are always 
identical. The human normal karyotype 
is represented by the formula 44+XX for 
women and 44+XY for men.
14. What is the other name 
given to sex chromosomes? 
What is the function of sex 
chromosomes?
Sex chromosomes are also called 
allosomes (the other chromosomes that 
are not sex chromosomes are called 
autosomes).
Sex chromosomes get such name 
because they have genes that 
determine the sex (male or female) of 
an individual. Sex chromosomes also 
have genes related to other biological 
functions.
15. How many chromosomes 
does a human normal haploid 
cell have? How many 
chromosomes does a human 
normal diploid cell have? How 
many are the sex 
chromosomes within each of 
them?
The human haploid cell is the gamete 
(egg cell and sperm cell). The human 
gamete has 22 autosomes and 1 
allosome, i.e., 23 chromosomes. The 
diploid cell is the somatic cell and it has 
44 autosomes and 2 allosomes, i.e., 46 
chromosomes.
Gametes have one sex chromosome and 
somatic cells have two sex 
chromosomes.
16. Do phylogenetically 
proximal species have cells 
with proximal chromosome 
counts?
The number of chromosomes typical of 
each species is proximal for 
phylogenetically proximal species (for 
example, orangutan, gorilla, 
chimpanzee and human). But it is not 
impossible that evolutionary distant 
species, like rat and oat, bears similar 
karyotypes and the same total number 
of chromosomes.
Even presenting equal number of 
chromosomes evolutionary distant 
species have radically different 
characteristics since the quantity and 
the sequence of nucleotides that 
compose their respective DNA molecules 
are quite different.
17. What is the nucleolus?
The nucleolus is a small and optically 
dense region in the interior of the cell 
nucleus. It is made of ribosomic RNA 
(rRNA) and proteins. One nucleus can 
have one or more nucleolus.

Biology Questions and Answers
Cell Division
1. What is mitosis? What is 
the importance of mitosis?
Mitosis is the process in which one 
eukaryotic cell divides into two cells 
identical to the parent cell (generally 
identical, since alterations in genetic 
material can occur, more or less 
organelles may be distributed between 
the daughter cells, etc.)
Mitosis is fundamental for asexual 
reproduction of eukaryotes, for the 
embryonic development, for the growth 
of pluricellular beings and for tissue 
renewal.
2. Why in some cases is 
mitosis a synonym of 
reproduction?
In some living beings asexual 
reproduction occurs by many means: 
binary division, schizogony, budding, 
grafting, etc. In asexual reproduction of 
eukaryotes mitosis is the mechanism by 
which the constituent cells of the new 
beings are made.
The term mitosis does not apply to 
prokaryotes since it involves nuclear 
division and eukaryotic structures.
3. What is the importance of 
mitosis for the embryonic 
development?
Every embryo grows from a single cell 
that suffers mitosis and generates other 
cells that also divide themselves by 
mitosis forming tissues and complete 
organs. The perfect regulation and 
control of each of those cell divisions 
are fundamental for the creation of a 
normal individual. Without mitosis the 
embryonic development would be 
impossible.
4. What are some examples of 
organs and tissues where 
mitosis is more frequent, less 
frequent or practically absent?
Generally in vertebrates mitosis is more 
frequent in tissues that require intense 
renewing due to their functions, like 
epithelial tissues and the bone marrow. 
In plants the meristem tissue has 
numerous cells undergoing mitosis.
Mitosis take place with low frequency in 
tissues of slow renovation, like the 
bones in adults and the connective 
tissues.
In some adult tissues mitosis is almost 
absent, like the nervous tissue and the 
striated muscle tissue (skeletal and 
cardiac). The nervous tissue develops 
from stimulus by development of new 
electrical networks between cells and 
the striated muscle tissue grows by 
cellular hypertrophy.

5. How does mitosis 
participate in the growth of 
pluricellular organisms?
All pluricellular beings grow with the 
increase in quantity of their cells. This 
increase is produced by mitosis 
(although some types of growth occur 
by cellular hypertrophy or by deposition 
of substances in interstitial spaces).
6. What is the uncontrolled 
mitotic process that occurs as 
disease in pluricellular beings 
called?
Uncontrolled mitotic cell division is 
called neoplasia. Neoplasia (the 
formation of new strange tissues) 
occurs when a cell suffers mutation in 
its genetic material, loses the ability to 
control its own division and the failure is 
transmitted to its descendants.
Cancers are malignant neoplasias. The 
term malignant means that neoplastic 
cells can disseminate to distant sites 
invading other organs and tissues. 
Neoplasias whose cells cannot 
disseminate to distant sites are called 
benign neoplasias.
7. Is the internal epithelium of 
the bowel the same as it was 
one month ago?
The internal epithelial covering of the 
intestine acts as protective barrier and 
also as means of nutrient absorption. 
The traffic of ingested material inside 
the intestinal lumen is very intense and 
the consequent tissue damage requires 
incessant epithelial renovation through 
cell division. The tissue renovation is 
completed in two to three days and is 
made by mitosis.
8. What is cellular 
regeneration? How is mitosis 
related to this process?
Some tissues are able to regenerate 
when injured. The liver, for example, 
regenerates when small pieces of 
hepatic tissue are removed, bones make 
new tissues in fracture regions, etc. 
Some animals, like planarias, are 
capable of regenerating their bodies 
when sectioned. In tissue regeneration 
cellular proliferation happens by mitosis.
9. What is cell cycle?
Cell cycle, or mitotic cycle, is the time 
period that begins when the cell is 
created and finishes when it is divided 
by mitosis creating two daughter cells. 
The cell cycle is divided into interphase 
and the mitotic phase.
10. Is cell division happening 
during the entire cell cycle? 
What is interphase?
Cell division properly occurs during the 
mitotic phase of the cell cycle. During 
interphase processes that are a 
preparation to cell division take place, 
like the duplication of DNA and 
centrioles. Interphase is the preceding

phase and the mitotic is the following 
phase.
11. What are the three periods 
into which interphase is 
divided?
Interphase is the preceding phase to the 
mitotic division. It is divided into three 
periods, G1, S and G2 (the letter G 
comes from “gap”, meaning interval or 
breach, and the letter S comes from 
“synthesis”, indicating the period in 
which DNA replicates).
In fact, “gap” is not totally appropriate 
for the periods immediately before and 
after the DNA synthesis. The idea of 
“growth” would be more adequate since 
in those periods (G1 and G2) the cell is 
growing to divide later in mitosis.
12. In general which phase of 
the cell cycle has longer 
duration?
The interphase comprises approximately 
4/5 of the cell cycle and the mitotic 
phase has quite a shorter length.
13. What are the events that 
mark the beginning and the 
end of the first interphase 
period? What happens within 
the cell in this period?
The first interphase period is the G1. It 
begins with the end of the preceding cell 
division, i.e., with the formation of the 
new cell and it ends with the beginning 
of DNA replication. In the G1 period the 
cell is growing.
14. What are the events that 
mark the beginning and the 
end of the second interphase 
period? What happens in the 
cell in this period?
The second interphase period is the S. 
It starts with the beginning of DNA 
replication and finishes with the end of 
that process. The main event in this 
period is the synthesis of new 
polynucleotide chains, each bound to 
each DNA chain that served as a 
template, i.e., the duplication of the 
original set of DNA molecules.
15. What are the events that 
mark the beginning and the 
end of the third interphase 
period? What happens in the 
cell in this period?
The third interphase period is the G2. It 
begins with the end of DNA replication 
and ends with the beginning of the first 
period of the mitotic phase. On G2 the 
cell is growing too and the duplication of 
centrioles occurs (only in cells that have 
these structures).

Biology Questions and Answers
16. Does mitosis properly 
occur before or after the 
interphase? Is it a mere “point 
of view” issue?
Mitosis must be considered a succeeding 
phase after interphase since this is a 
preparation step to mitosis. Thus it is 
not merely a point of view issue.
17. Into which periods is 
mitosis divided?
Mitosis is divided into four periods: 
prophase, metaphase, anaphase and 
telophase.
18. What are centrioles? In 
which type of cell are they 
present?
Centrioles are tiny cylindrical structures 
made of nine microtubule triplets. They 
appear in pairs in the cell. Centrioles 
participate in the making of 
cytoskeleton and of cilia and flagella. In 
cell division they play a role in the 
formation of the aster fibers.
Centrioles are structures present in 
animal cells, in most protists and in 
some primitive fungi. There are no 
centrioles in cells of superior plants and 
in general it is considered that plant 
cells do not have centrioles (although 
this is not entirely correct since some 
plants have centriole-containing cells).
The region where the centrioles are 
located is called the centrosome of the 
cell.
19. What are the main events 
of the first mitotic period?
The first mitotic period is prophase. 
During prophase the following events 
occur: migration of each centriole pair 
(centrioles were duplicated in 
interphase) to opposite cell poles; aster 
formation around the centriole pairs; 
formation of the spindle fibers between 
the two centriole pairs; end of 
chromosome condensation; 
disintegration of the nucleolus; breaking 
of the karyotheca; dispersion of 
condensed chromosomes in the 
cytoplasm; binding of chromosomes to 
the spindle fibers.
20. What is the mitotic 
apparatus?
Mitotic apparatus is the set of aster 
fibers, radial structures around each 
centriole pair, plus the spindle fibers, 
fibers that extend across the cell 
between the two centriole pairs located 
in opposite cell poles. The mitotic 
apparatus appears in prophase and has 
important role in the orientation and 
gripping of chromosomes and other 
cellular elements causing them to 
separate and migrate to opposite cell 
poles.
Substances that disallow the formation 
of the mitotic apparatus, like colchicine, 
a molecule that binds to tubulin 
molecules and prevents the synthesis of 
microtubules, interrupt cell division. 
Colchicine is used to study 
chromosomes since it paralyzes mitosis 
when chromosomes are condensed and 
so are more easily viewed under the 
microscope.

Biology Questions and Answers
21. What are the main events 
of the second mitotic period?
The second mitotic period is metaphase. 
In metaphase the following events 
occur: condensed chromosomes bind (in 
their centromere region) to the spindle 
fibers and get concentrated in the 
middle of the cell; the formation of the 
mitotic apparatus is completed. 
Metaphase ends with the breaking of 
the binding of identical chromatids and 
then anaphase begins.
22. What are the main events 
of the third mitotic period?
The third mitotic period is anaphase. In 
anaphase the following events occur: 
duplication and breaking of centromeres 
with separation of identical chromatids; 
traction (by the spindle fibers) of 
identical chromatids each to opposite 
cell poles; beginning of chromosome 
decondensation.
23. During mitotic anaphase is 
there separation of 
homologous chromosomes or 
separation of identical 
chromatids?
In the anaphase of mitosis the identical 
chromatids separate and complete pairs 
of homologous chromosomes continue 
to exist in each daughter cell. The 
separation of the homologous 
chromosomes occurs in the anaphase of 
the cell division by meiosis.
24. What are the main events 
of the final mitotic period?
The final mitotic phase is telophase. In 
telophase the following events occur: 
decondensation of chromosomes, each 
set located in opposite cell poles; 
karyotecha formation around each set of 
chromosomes forming two nuclei; 
destruction of the mitotic apparatus; 
reappearing of the nucleoli; beginning of 
cytokinesis (the division of cytoplasm to 
ultimately separate the new cells).
25. What is the name of the 
cytoplasm division in the end 
of mitosis? What are the 
differences in this process 
between animal and plant 
cells?
Cytoplasm division occurs after 
telophase and it is called cytokinesis. In 
animal cells an invagination of the 
plasma membrane toward the cell 
center appears in the equator of the 
parent cell and then the cell is 
strangulated in that region and divided 
into two daughter cells. This type of 
division is called centripetal cytokinesis 
(from outside).
In plant cells the cytokinesis is not 
centripetal since the division happens 
from the inside. Membranous sacs full of 
pectin concentrate in the internal central 
region of the cell and propagate to the 
periphery toward the plasma 
membrane. The pectin-containing sacs 
fuse themselves and form a central 
structure called phragmoplast. On the 
phragmoplast cellulose deposition 
occurs and a true cell wall is created to

separate the daughter cells. Plant cells 
thus present centrifugal cytokinesis.
The phragmoplast has “failures”, or 
pores, to permit cytoplasmic 
communications between the daughter 
cells. These openings are called 
plasmodesms.
26. Why is it important for 
chromosomes to be 
condensed during mitosis and 
decondensed during 
interphase?
During mitosis the main problem to be 
solved is the correct separation of 
chromosome sets between daughter 
cells. If chromosomes were 
decondensed long tiny fibers of DNA 
would be dispersed in cytoplasm after 
the karyotheca breaking and 
chromosomes could not be easily 
organized and pulled by the spindle 
fibers.
During interphase the function of 
chromosomes, i.e, of DNA molecules, is 
the synthesis of RNA and thus of 
proteins. For this task it is necessary for 
functional molecular regions to be 
decondensed (these regions form the 
euchromatin). During interphase in 
addition DNA replication occurs as a 
preparatory step for cell division. In this 
process it is fundamental for the 
exposition of DNA molecules to serve as 
templates to new DNA chains under 
production.
27. How does the quantity of 
genetic material vary within 
the cell during the sequential 
phases of the cell cycle?
The first period of the first phase 
(interphase) of the cell cycle is the G1, 
followed by S and G2 and then by the 
mitotic phase.
In G1 the ploidy (the quantity of DNA 
molecules in the cell) can be 
represented by the formula 2n (n is the 
number of DNA molecules in a gamete 
cell of a given species). In S DNA 
duplicates and the quantity of genetic 
material increases from 2n to 4n. In G2 
that quantity is constant: 4n. After the 
mitotic phase the quantity of genetic 
material decreases to 2n in each 
daughter cell.
28. What are the differences 
between astral and anastral 
mitosis?
Astral mitosis is that in which there is 
formation of the aster, a structure made 
by the centrioles. Anastral mitosis is 
that in which there is no formation of 
the aster; it occurs in cells without 
centrioles, like plant cells (superior 
plants).
29. Can mitosis occur in 
haploid (n) cells? And in 
triploid cells?
The mitotic cell division can occur in 
haploid (n) cells, diploid (2n) cells, 
triploid (3n) cells, etc. Mitosis is a

copying process that does not interfere 
with cell ploidy.
30. Concerning their final 
products (daughter cells and 
their ploidies) what are the 
differences between mitosis 
and meiosis?
In mitosis one cell, for example, with 2n 
chromosomes, duplicates its 
chromosomal set and divides generating 
two other cells, each with 2n 
chromosomes too. In meiosis, one 
diploid cell (2n) duplicates its 
chromosomes too, but four cells with n 
chromosomes are generated.
31. Concerning their biological 
function what is the difference 
between mitosis and meiosis?
The main biological function of mitosis is 
cellular multiplication, a fundamental 
process for the growth and development 
of multicellular organisms, tissue 
renewing, asexual reproduction, etc. 
The biological function of meiosis is 
gamete formation (in gametic meiosis) 
or spore formation (in sporic meiosis), 
i.e., the production of cells qualified for 
sexual reproduction with half the 
quantity of chromosomes compared to 
the original cell.
There is a special type of meiosis that 
happens in zygotes of some algae, 
protozoans and fungi. This meiosis, 
called zygotic meiosis, has the function 
of reducing to a half the number of 
chromosomes of adult individuals that 
will be formed from the zygote. In 
species with zygotic meiosis the adult 
individuals are haploid and they form 
gametes by mitosis. These gametes 
fuse in pairs with others and generate a 
diploid zygote that, then, undergoes 
meiosis to restitute the normal ploidy of 
adult individuals.
32. For the biological diversity 
is mitosis or meiosis the more 
important process?
Meiosis is the cell division process that 
allows the formation of gametes to 
sexual reproduction, with aleatory 
separation of each chromosome of the 
individual homologous pairs. These 
gametes can fecundate gametes from 
other individuals promoting combination 
of homologous chromosomes from 
different individuals. In that manner the 
chromosomal recombination provided 
by meiosis and sexual reproduction 
creates individuals with dissimilar 
genetic patrimony from their fathers 
and thus promotes biological diversity.
Some fungi species and plants, for 
example, present sporic meiosis, i.e., a 
structure where half of the 
chromosomes of the species is 
generated from meiosis. This structure, 
by mitosis, forms gametes. Even in this 
case diversity comes from meiosis. 
Meiosis then is the cell division process 
that in conjunction with genetic 
mutations is responsible for the 
biological diversity.
Even in species having zygotic meiosis 
the aleatory separation of homologous 
chromosomes in meiosis creates 
biological diversity.

Biology Questions and Answers
33. What are the respective 
ploidies of gamete, zygote and 
somatic cells in a species with 
gametic meiosis?
Adopting as pattern an “x” quantity of 
chromosomes for gametes, zygotes will 
have 2x chromosomes and somatic cells 
will have 2x too.
34. Why is meiosis important 
for the maintenance of the 
normal quantity of 
chromosomes of a species 
with sexual reproduction?
A reduction to a half of the maximum 
normal quantity of chromosomes is 
mandatory in some phase of the life 
cycle of a species that reproduces 
sexually. If that could not happen in 
each generation, whenever a zygote is 
formed by fusion of gametes there 
would be duplication in the quantity of 
chromosomes in a geometric 
progression.
35. What is the difference 
between sexual spores and 
gametes? Do humans present 
sexual spores or gametes?
Sexual spores are structures generated 
from meiosis with ploidy (number of 
chromosomes) reduction to a half 
compared to the spore mother cell. 
Spores germinate and give existence to 
gametophytes, individuals that by 
mitosis form gametes. The meiosis that 
generates sexual spores is called sporic 
meiosis; it is, for example, the type of 
meiosis that occurs in plants.
Gametes are also cells with half the 
number of chromosomes of the normal 
cell of the species, but they are 
specialized in fecundation, the fusion 
with another gamete that generates the 
zygote, a cell with double the number of 
chromosomes than gametic cells. 
Gametes can appear from gametic 
meiosis or by mitosis in gametophytes 
originated from sexual spores.
In humans as well in most animals the 
meiosis is gametic. There are no spores 
nor alternation of generations. The male 
gamete is the sperm cell, and the 
female gamete is the egg cell.
36. Is the interphase of 
meiosis different from the 
interphase of mitosis?
The interphase that precedes meiosis is 
similar to the interphase that precedes 
mitosis. In them the main event is DNA 
replication (chromosome duplication).
37. What are the two divisions 
of meiosis? What are the main 
events that occur in those 
divisions?
Meiosis is divided into first meiotic 
division, or meiosis I, and second 
meiotic division, or meiosis II. During 
meiosis I the separation of homologous 
chromosomes occurs, with formation of 
two haploid cells. In meiosis II there is 
separation of identical chromatids of

each of the two haploid cells created in 
meiosis I, giving birth to four haploid 
cells.
Meiosis II is a process identical to 
mitosis.
38. In which meiotic division 
does the separation of the 
homologous occur? What are 
the ploidies of the generated 
cells after the end of that 
process?
The separation of the homologous 
chromosomes occurs in the first division 
of meiosis, or meiosis I. After the end of 
this cell division two haploid cells are 
made, each having different 
chromosomes (with no set of 
homologous). Note that in the cells 
generated after meiosis I each 
chromosome is still duplicated since the 
homologous chromosomes and not the 
identical chromatids were separated.
39. In which meiotic division 
does the separation of 
identical chromatids occur? 
After the end of this process 
what are the ploidies of the 
new cells?
The separation of identical chromatids 
occurs in the second meiotic division, or 
meiosis II. After this cell division 
(similar to mitosis and that does not 
alter ploidy) the cells are still haploid 
(they have become haploid after 
meiosis I).
40. How many cells are made 
after meiosis I and meiosis II?
After meiosis I two cells with already 
separated homologous are created. 
After meiosis II four cells are created.
41. What are the periods of 
the first meiotic division?
Meiosis I is divided into prophase I, 
metaphase I, anaphase I and telophase 
I.
42. In which period of meiosis 
does the pairing of 
homologous chromosomes 
occur?
The pairing of homologous 
chromosomes is a vital step for meiosis 
because the rightness of the 
homologous separation depends on the 
process. This event occurs in prophase I 
of the cell division.
43. What is crossing over? In 
which period of meiosis does 
this event occur?
Crossing over is the eventual exchange 
of chromosomal fragments between 
homologous chromosomes. The 
phenomenon occurs in prophase I when 
homologous chromosomes are paired. 
Crossing over is of great importance for 
evolution and biodiversity since it

provides recombination of alleles (of 
different genes) linked in the same 
chromosome during cell divison by 
meiosis.
44. What are the “chiasms” of 
homologous chromosomes 
seen in prophase I?
Chiasms are intersections of two tracts 
in the form of X.
The chiasms seen in prophase I are 
chromosome arms crossing over same 
arms of their homologous. In fact when 
chiasms are seen under the microscope 
chromatids are exchanging 
chromosomal segments with other 
chromatids of its homologous.
45. Is there interphase again 
between meiosis I and 
meiosis II?
There is no interphase nor DNA 
duplication between the divisions of 
meiosis. Only a short interval called 
diakinesis occurs.
46. What are the periods of 
the second meiotic division?
Meiosis II is divided into prophase II, 
metaphase II, anaphase II and telofase 
II.
47. What are the respective 
functions of the separation of 
homologous chromosomes 
and of the separation of 
identical chromatids in 
meiosis?
The separation of homologous 
chromosomes in meiosis I has two main 
functions: to reduce to a half the total 
number of chromosomes, generating 
haploid daughter cells at the end of the 
process, and to make possible genetic 
recombination since the separation is 
aleatory, i.e., each pair of daughter cells 
can be different from the other pair 
relating chromosomal combination from 
paternal and maternal origins. (And if 
crossing over is considered each of the 
four resulting cells can be different from 
the others.)
The separation of identical chromatids in 
meiosis II has the same function it has 
in mitosis: to separate the 
chromosomes already duplicated to the 
daughter cells.
48. During which meiosis 
division does ploidy reduction 
occur? Does ploidy reduction 
occur in mitosis?
In the cell division by meiosis ploidy 
reduction occurs in meiosis II. Initially, 
taking as example a 2n somatic cell, 
ploidy increases to 4n (duplication of 
DNA) during interphase. During meiosis 
I, since homologous chromosomes are 
separated, ploidy falls to 2n (the original 
number) and then during meiosis II 
ploidy finally falls to n in the resulting 
daughter cells.

Photosynthesis
1. What is the primary source 
of energy for living beings on 
earth?
The sun, center of our planetary system 
and star of the milky way galaxy (our 
galaxy), is the source of the energy that 
is processed and consumed by living 
beings. Intense nuclear reactions in the 
sun liberate light and other energetic 
radiations into the surrounding space. 
Some of this energy reaches our planet.
2. How is light from the sun 
transformed into chemical 
energy to be used by the 
living beings on earth?
Light from the sun is transformed into 
chemical energy contained in organic 
material by the photosynthesis process. 
In photosynthesis light, water and 
carbon dioxide react and highly 
energetic glucose molecules and 
molecular oxygen are made.
3. What is the chemical 
equation of photosynthesis?
The chemical equation of photosynthesis 
is the following:
6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light --> C6H12O6 + 6 
O2
4. Which are the living beings 
that carry out photosynthesis? 
Which is the cell organelle 
responsible for the absorption 
of light for the photosynthesis 
process in plants and algae?
There are many beings (including all 
animals) that do not carry out 
photosynthesis. There are also 
autotrophic beings that do not perform 
photosynthesis but they perform 
chemosynthesis. Plants, algae and 
cyanobacteria are photosynthetic 
beings.
In plants and algae, light is absorbed by 
chlorophyll, a molecule present in 
cytoplasmic organelles called 
chloroplasts.
5. Are there chloroplasts in 
cyanobacteria?
In cyanobacteria there are no 
chloroplasts and the chlorophyll layers 
are dispersed in cytosol.
6. Which chemical element is 
central in the chlorophyll 
molecule?
The chemical element that is central in 
the chlorophyll molecule is magnesium. 
One atom of magnesium is present in 
the center of an amalgam of eight 
nitrogen-containing carbon rings.

7. How do chloroplasts 
multiply?
Like mitochondria chloroplasts have 
their own DNA, RNA and ribosomes and 
they self-replicate through binary 
division.
8. How can the hypothesis 
that asserts that chloroplasts 
as well as mitochondria were 
primitive prokaryotes that 
associated in mutualism with 
primitive anaerobic eukaryotic 
cells be corroborated?
The described hypothesis is known as 
the endosymbiotic hypothesis about the 
evolutionary origin of mitochondria and 
choloroplasts.
Mutualism is explained as: mitochondria 
and chloroplasts can offer energy and 
nutrients to the cell in exchange for 
protection. The hypothesis is 
strengthened since those organelles 
have their own DNA, RNA and protein 
synthesis machinery and they divide 
themselves through binary division like 
bacteria do.
9. What are the main 
structures of chloroplasts?
Chloroplasts are involved by two 
membrane layers, the outer and the 
inner membranes. Inside the organelle 
the formative unit is called the granum, 
a coin-shaped structure that, piled with 
others grana, forms several structures 
called thylakoids. The thylakoids fill the 
chloroplast and an intergrana 
membrane permeates the interior of the 
organelle.
10. In which chloroplast 
structure are chlorophyll 
molecules found?
Chlorophyll molecules are placed in an 
organized manner in order to enhance 
the exposure to light on the thylakoid 
surfaces.
11. What do ATP and ADP 
mean? What are the roles of 
these molecules for the 
cellular energetic metabolism?
ATP is an abbreviation of adenosine 
triphosphate, a molecule made of 
adenosine bound to three inorganic 
phosphates. ADP is an abbreviation of 
adenosine diphosphate, two molecules 
of phosphate bound to adenosine. ATP 
is a molecule that stores energy for the 
cell. When ATP hydrolyzes and becomes 
ADP energy is liberated and then 
consumed by several metabolic 
reactions of the organism.
12. What is ADP 
phosphorylation? What 
respectively are 
photophosphorylation and 
oxidative phosphorylation?

Biology Questions and Answers
ADP phosphorylation is the addition of 
one inorganic phosphate in the molecule 
of adenosine diphosphate thus creating 
ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and 
incorporating energy. The 
phosphorylation is oxidative when the 
energy incorporated comes from the 
breaking of organic molecules having 
oxygen as reagent, as in aerobic cellular 
respiration. The reaction is called 
photophosphorylation when the energy 
source is light, as in photosynthesis.
The energy incorporated into ATP is 
disposable (liberated) to other cellular 
reactions when ATP hydrolyzes and ADP 
is formed again.
13. What are the stages into 
which photosynthesis is 
divided?
Photosynthesis is divided into the 
photochemical stage, or light reactions, 
and the chemical stage.
14. What are the processes of 
the photochemical stage of 
the photosynthesis process?
Photolysis of water, with liberation of 
molecular oxygen, and 
photophosphorylation of ADP, with 
production of ATP and NADPH, are the 
processes that occur during the 
photochemical stage of photosynthesis.
15. How is the photic energy 
absorbed by chlorophyll 
transfered to ATP molecules in 
photophosphorylation? How 
will be the resulting ATP 
used?
Light excites chlorophyll and energizes 
electrons that jump off the molecule. 
The energy liberated when these 
electrons escape is used in the 
phosphorylation of ADP, forming ATP. 
The enzyme that catalyzes the reaction 
is the ATP synthase.
The resulting ATP is then consumed in 
the next chemical stage of 
photosynthesis to energetically enrich 
carbon dioxide for the formation of 
glucose.
16. Is it correct to consider 
water decomposition by the 
action of light the basis of the 
photosynthesis process?
Besides ADP photophosphorylation, 
photic energy is also responsible for the 
breaking of water molecules during 
photosynthesis in a process known as 
water photolysis. In this reaction water 
molecules are exposed to photic energy 
and liberate protons (hydrogen ions), 
highly energetic electrons and molecular 
oxygen (O2). Later the hydrogen atoms 
will be incorporated into carbon dioxide 
molecules to form glucose. Since water 
is the hydrogen donor for 
photosynthesis it is correct to say that 
the water photolysis is the basis of the 
process.

The electrons will replace those 
electrons lost by chlorophyll molecules 
in photophosphorylation. The hydrogen 
ions will be incorporated into hydrogen 
acceptor molecules (NADP) and later 
will be used in the synthesis of glucose 
during the chemical stage. Molecular 
oxygen is liberated to the atmosphere.

In sulfur photosynthetic bacteria the 
substance that donates hydrogen is

Therefore there is no liberation of 
molecular oxygen but there is 
production of molecular sulfur (S2). 
(Oxygen and sulfur have same number 
of valence electrons.)
19. Why is it said that during 
photosynthesis carbon dioxide 
is enriched to form glucose?
During photosynthesis carbon dioxide is 
energetically enriched with hydrogen 
from water. Water broken by photolysis 
is the hydrogen donor of the reaction. 
Glucose is made of carbon and oxygen 
atoms obtained from carbon dioxide and 
of hydrogen atoms obtained from water.
20. What is the complete 
chemical equation of 
photosynthesis?
The complete chemical equation of 
photosynthesis is the following:
6 CO2 + 12 H2O + light --> C6H12O6 + 
6 H2O + 6 O2
21. What is an example of a 
lab experiment that shows the 
variation of the 
photosynthesis efficiency in 
relation to different photic 
energy frequencies to which 
the reaction is exposed? Was 
it expected that green light 
frequency favored the 
reaction?
The experiment: Plants of same species 
and ages are placed each under 
(respecting their photoperiods) light 
sources emitting only one of the colors 
of the light spectrum (violet, anil, blue, 
green, yellow and red). The experiment 
is executed with each of the colors and 
after days each plant's development is 
compared. Those plants whose 
development was normal performed 
satisfactory photosynthesis while those 
with abnormal development underused 
the offered light.

Chlorophyll is green because it reflects 
the green light frequency, i.e., it does 
not “use” the green range of the 
electromagnetic spectrum. Thus green 
light does not favor photosynthesis 
(curiously green is the light that plants 
“dislike”).
22. What are the divisions of 
white light according to the 
electromagnetic spectrum? 
Which are the two most 
efficient colors for 
photosynthesis?
The color divisions of the 
electromagnetic spectrum in decreasing 
order of frequency are: red, orange, 
yellow, green, blue, anil and violet. 
When mixed together these colors 
generate white.
Experimentally it is verified that the 
most useful colors for photosynthesis 
are blue and red.
23. What is NADP and NADPH?
NADP is the abbreviation of the 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate cation, a hydrogen acceptor. 
NADPH is made when NADP binds to 
one hydrogen atom and it is the form 
that actually transports hydrogen.
24. Photosynthesis is the most 
important producer of 
molecular oxygen (O2) on our 
planet. From which molecule 
do oxygen atoms liberated by 
photosynthesis come? From 
which other molecule could 
one suspect they have come? 
What are the destinations of 
those oxygen atoms?
The oxygen atoms liberated as 
molecular oxygen by the photosynthesis 
process come from water.
One indeed could suspect that those 
oxygen atoms would have come from 
carbon dioxide. Oxygen atoms from 
carbon dioxide however are 
incorporated into glucose molecules and 
into water molecules liberated in the 
chemical stage of photosynthesis.
25. Where do the 
photochemical and the 
chemical stages of 
photosynthesis occur?
The photochemical stage of the 
photosynthesis process occurs mainly 
on the thylakoids (the green part) and 
the chemical stage occurs in the stroma 
(the colorless framework) of the 
chloroplasts.

26. Which are the subproducts 
of the photochemical stage 
that are essential for the 
chemical stage of 
photosynthesis?
The chemical stage of photosynthesis 
depends on NADPH and ATP produced in 
the “light reactions” (photochemical 
stage).
27. What are the roles of 
NADPH and ATP in the 
chemical stage of 
photosynthesis?
NADPH acts as reductant of carbon 
dioxide, it delivers highly energetic 
hydrogens to precursor molecules 
during the glucose formation process. 
ATP is an energy source for the 
reactions of chemical stage.
28. Why is the nickname “dark 
reactions” not entirely correct 
for the chemical stage of 
photosynthesis?
“Dark reactions” is not a correct name 
for the chemical stage of photosynthesis 
since the reactions of the chemical 
stage also occur in the presence of light.
29. What is the general 
chemical equation of 
photosynthesis? Why doesn't 
that equation clearly show the 
real origin of the molecular 
oxygen liberated?
The general equation of photosynthesis 
is:
6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light --> C6H12O6 + 
6 O2.
Water molecules are also produced in 
the chemical stage of photosynthesis as 
the following complete equation reveals:
6 CO2 + 12 H2O + light --> C6H12O6 + 
6 H2O + 6  O2
Water molecules are present in the 
reagent side as well in the product side 
of the equation. Pure mathematical 
simplification of stoichiometric 
coefficients however leads to elimination 
of water from the product side and it 
then seems that 6 molecules of 
molecular oxygen (O2), i.e., 12 atoms of 
oxygen, are made for each 6 molecules 
of water, i.e., 6 oxygen atoms, in the 
reagent side. Thus a false impression 
that 6 other oxygens come from carbon 
dioxide is created.
30. What are the three main 
limiting factors of 
photosynthesis?
The three main limiting factors of 
photosynthesis process are light 
intensity, carbon dioxide concentration 
and temperature.

Biology Questions and Answers
31. Photosynthesis rate varies 
according to the photic energy 
intensity. Does the same occur 
in aerobic respiration? What 
happens to the glucose 
balance as a result of these 
variations?
In a photosynthetic being the aerobic 
respiration rate can be superior, inferior 
or equal to the photosynthesis rate. 
Respiration rate depends on the 
energetic needs of the plant while the 
photosynthesis rate varies, as other 
conditions are maintained, with the 
variation of light energy.
In a situation in which the respiration 
rate is greater than the photosynthesis 
rate glucose consumption is higher than 
glucose production. In a situation in 
which the respiration rate is lower than 
photosynthesis rate there is 
accumulation of glucose (positive 
balance). In a situation in which the 
rates are equal all molecular oxygen 
produced by the photosynthesis process 
is used in respiration and all carbon 
dioxide liberated by respiration is 
consumed in photosynthesis and so 
there is no positive balance of glucose 
nor depletion of carbohydrate stores.
32. What is the compensation 
point? What is the implication 
of the compensation point for 
the plant growth?
The (photic) compensation point is the 
photic energy intensity under which 
aerobic respiration rate equals 
photosynthesis rate. In this situation all 
produced glucose is consumed and 
there is no incorporation of material into 
the plant and thus the plant growth 
discontinues.
33. Why is the carbon dioxide 
concentration a limiting factor 
of the photosynthesis 
process? When the carbon 
dioxide concentration is 
increased indefinitely is 
photosynthesis also increased 
indefinitely?
The availability of carbon dioxide is a 
limiting factor for the photosynthesis 
process because this gas is a reagent of 
the reaction.
Since enzymes catalyze the building of 
organic molecules with carbon atoms 
from carbon dioxide photosynthesis 
stops as soon as these enzymes become 
saturated, i.e., when all their activation 
centers are bound to their substrates. In 
that situation an increase of the carbon 
dioxide concentration will not increase 
the photosynthesis rate.
34. Why do some trees lose 
their green color in the 
autumn?
In autumn days become shorter and 
nights longer thus there is a reduction 
of the photosynthesis rate and some 
plants prepare themselves for the 
winter making nutrient stores. In this 
process, nutrients from the leaves travel 
towards storage sites: limbs, trunk and 
roots. With less chlorophyll produced in 
leaves the typical green color of the 
plant fades.

Biology Questions and Answers
Cell Respiration
1. How do cells obtain energy 
for their functioning?
Cells obtain energy for their metabolic 
reactions from the breaking of organic 
molecules with high energetic content. 
This energy is mostly stored as ATP 
molecules.
The process of obtaining energy in order 
to produce ATP molecules is named 
cellular respiration.
2. What is the compound that 
is phosphorylated for ATP 
formation? What is the 
resulting compound when ATP 
liberates energy?
ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, is 
formed after the binding of one 
phosphate (phosphorylation) to one ADP 
(adenosine diphosphate) molecule. This 
is a process that stores energy into the 
produced ATP molecule.
When ATP gives energy to the cellular 
metabolism it loses one of its 
phosphates and ADP reappears.
ADP can also lose more phosphates and 
generate AMP (adenosine 
monophosphate) or even non-
phosphorylated adenosine. Adenosine 
production from ATP is a solution used 
in tissues that need urgent oxygen 
supply, for example, in the heart during 
myocardial infarction (heart attack), 
since adenosine has a local vasodilator 
effect thus providing faster vasodilation 
than other physiological methods.
3. What are the types of cell 
respiration?
There are two types of cell respiration: 
aerobic cell respiration, a reaction with 
participation of molecular oxygen (O2), 
and anaerobic cell respiration, without 
participation of molecular oxygen but 
with other inorganic molecules as 
oxidant. There are several varieties of 
anaerobic cell respiration, the main one 
is fermentation.
4. Under which conditions do 
aerobic cells carry out 
fermentation?
Some cells that usually obtain energy 
from aerobic cellular respiration can 
carry out fermentation when oxygen is 
not available.
There are bacteria and fungi that under 
absence of oxygen use their anaerobic 
metabolic capability for energetic 
supply. Muscle cells carry out 
fermentation too when oxygen is scarce.
5. What is the difference 
between aerobic and 
anaerobic beings?
Aerobic organisms are those whose cells 
do not survive without oxygen since

they depend on aerobic cell respiration 
to obtain energy for ATP production. 
Anaerobic organisms are those that live 
or can live under oxygen-lacking 
environments.
6. What is the difference 
between facultative anaerobic 
beings and obligate anaerobic 
beings?
Facultative anaerobic beings, like the 
fungi Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a 
brewing yeast, can survive under 
oxygen-poor environments carrying out 
fermentation. However when oxygen is 
available these beings carry out aerobic 
respiration.
Obligate anaerobic beings are those that 
cannot survive when oxygen is present. 
Some fungi, some bacteria (like the 
agent of botulism Clostridium 
botulinum, and the agent of tetanus, 
Clostridium tetani) and some 
protozoans are examples of obligate 
anaerobes.
7. What are the two types of 
fermentation? What are their 
chemical equations?
The two main types of fermentation are 
alcoholic fermentation and lactic 
fermentation.
In alcoholic fermentation pyruvic acid, 
an intermediate molecule, is converted 
into ethanol with liberation of carbon 
dioxide. The alcoholic fermentation 
equation is as follows:
C6H12O6 + 2 ADP + P --> 2 C2H5OH + 
2 CO2 + 2 ATP
In lactic fermentation pyruvic acid is 
transformed into lactic acid and there is 
no production of carbon dioxide. The 
lactic fermentation equation is:
C6H12O6 + 2 ADP + P --> 2 C3H5OOH + 2 
ATP
8. In general what are the 
reagents and products of 
fermentation?
In fermentation glucose (sugar) is 
degraded into pyruvic acid (each 
glucose molecule forms two pyruvic acid 
molecules). In this process two 
molecules of ATP are produced.
According to the type of fermentation, 
pyruvic acid can produce ethanol and 
carbon dioxide (in alcoholic 
fermentation) or lactic acid (in lactic 
fermentation). There are other varieties 
of fermentation in which pyruvic acid 
can generate acetic acid (acetic 
fermentation), propionic acid, 
isopropanol (an alcohol too), etc. The 
type of fermentation depends on the 
species of the involved organisms.
9. Why in cake and bread 
manufacture are alcoholic 
fermenting organisms used 
and not lactic fermenting 
organisms?
Fermentation has the function of 
making cakes and breads grow. This is

accomplished by liberation of carbon 
dioxide in alcoholic fermentation as the 
gas passes through the dough and 
makes it grow. In lactic fermentation 
there is no liberation of carbon dioxide 
and the desired result would not be 
obtained.
10. To what substance is the 
acidic flavor of fermented milk 
due?
Some bacteria ferment milk lactose by 
lactic fermentation producing lactic acid. 
This product is responsible for the acidic 
flavor of yogurts, curd and milk.
11. How can the knowledge 
about fermentation explain 
the origin of muscle cramps 
and pains after intense 
physical exertion?
A typical fermentation process due to 
oxygen scarcity happens in the muscle 
tissue. Under intense use muscles 
demand too much energy (ATP) and 
consume much more oxygen to produce 
that energy. High consumption leads to 
oxygen scarcity and the muscle cells 
begin to make lactic fermentation trying 
to satisfy their energetic needs. In this 
situation muscle pain, cramps and 
fatigue are due to the lactic acid 
released by fermentation.
12. How many ATP molecules 
are produced for each glucose 
molecule used in 
fermentation? How many ATP 
molecules are produced for 
each glucose molecule used in 
aerobic respiration?
In fermentation from one glucose 
molecule two ATP molecules are 
produced. In aerobic respiration, a 
much more productive process, from 
one glucose molecule 36 ATP molecules 
are made.
13. Which is the cell organelle 
that is specialized in aerobic 
respiration?
The cell organelles that are specialized 
in aerobic respiration are the 
mitochondria.
14. Of which main compounds 
is the mitochondrion structure 
made?
Mitochondria are organelles delimited by 
two lipid membranes. The inner 
membrane invaginates to the interior of 
the organelle forming cristae and 
delimiting an internal space known as 
the mitochondrial matrix.

Biology Questions and Answers
15. What are the three phases 
into which the cell respiration 
is divided?
The three phases of aerobic cell 
respiration are glycolysis, Krebs cycle 
and respiratory chain (also known as 
the electron transport chain).
16. What is glycolysis? What 
are the products of this 
process?
Glycolysis, the first stage of the aerobic 
cell respiration, is a process in which 
glucose is degraded (broken) to form 
two pyruvic acid molecules along with 
the formation of two ATP and two 
NADH.
Glycolysis is a complex reaction 
implying the formation of several 
intermediate molecules until pyruvic 
acid molecules are made. Although two 
ATP molecules are consumed in the 
reaction, there is also production of four 
molecules of ATP, thus a positive 
balance of two ATP molecules is 
obtained. Two NADH molecules are also 
produced. In glycolysis the 6-carbon 
structure of glucose is broken and two 
organic chains of three carbons each are 
made; these chains give birth to two 
pyruvic acid molecules.
17. Does glycolysis occur 
within the mitochondria?
Glycolysis happens in the cytosol and 
not within the mitochondria. Pyruvic 
acid molecules later enter mitochondria 
to participate in the next phase of the 
aerobic cell respiration.
18. How many ATP molecules 
are made after glycolysis?
Glycolysis is a process similar to glucose 
degradation in fermentation. It produces 
(final balance) two molecules of ATP for 
each broken glucose.
19. What is NAD? What is the 
role of the NAD molecule in 
glycolysis?
NAD (nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide) is a hydrogen acceptor 
necessary as reductant (to receive 
hydrogen) in some reactions in which it 
is reduced and converted into NADH2. 
During glycolysis two NAD molecules 
retrieve hydrogens liberated after an 
intermediate reaction thus forming 
NADH2.
20. What happens during 
aerobic respiration to the 
pyruvic acid molecules made 
by glycolysis? What is the 
sequence of reactions that 
then follows?
The pyruvic acid molecules made in 
cytosol by glycolysis enter into the 
mitochondria.
Within the mitochondria each pyruvic 
acid molecule is converted into one 
molecule of acetyl-CoA (acetyl

coenzyme A) with liberation of one 
carbon dioxide. The Krebs cycle (also 
known as citric acid cycle), the second 
stage of aerobic respiration, then 
begins.
21. What is the official name 
of pyruvic acid?
Pyruvic acid is 2-oxopropanoic acid. It is 
thus a molecule made of three linearly 
bound carbons with one extremity 
forming the organic acid function 
(COOH) and the middle carbon binding 
to an oxygen atom by double bond.
22. Why can it be said that 
each glucose molecule runs 
the Krebs cycle twice?
Each glucose molecule “cycles” the 
Krebs cycle twice because after 
glycolysis each used glucose has 
generated two pyruvic acid molecules 
and each pyruvic acid is converted in a 
1:1 proportion into acetyl CoA. Each 
acetyl CoA then cycles the Krebs cycle 
once.
23. Why is the Krebs cycle 
also called the final common 
pathway of the degradation of 
organic compounds?
The Krebs cycle is called the final 
common pathway of the degradation of 
organic compounds because it is also 
possible to generate acetyl CoA from 
the degradation of lipids and proteins. 
Since acetyl CoA is the substrate that 
triggers the Krebs cycle, this process is 
called the final common pathway for 
being activated by other organic 
molecules (lipids and proteins) and not 
only by glucose.
The organism uses energetic reserves of 
fat and proteins to cycle the Krebs cycle 
when undergoing malnutrition or when 
there is no glucose available for the 
cells.
24. What are the final 
energetic products of each 
round of the Krebs cycle? 
Where is most part of the utile 
energy at the end of Krebs 
cycle found?
After each round of the Krebs cycle two 
carbon dioxide molecules, eight protons 
(hydrogen ions) captured by NAD and 
FAD (a hydrogen acceptor too) and one 
ATP molecule are produced.
During the Krebs cycle acetyl CoA is 
degraded. At the end the utile energy is 
incorporated into hydrogens transported 
by FADH2 and NADH2 molecules.
25. How many carbon dioxide 
molecules are liberated after 
each cycle of the Krebs cycle? 
For a single glucose how many 
carbon dioxide molecules 
were already liberated by the 
aerobic respiration at that 
point?

Biology Questions and Answers
Each round of the Krebs cycle liberates 
two carbon dioxide molecules.
At the end of the cycle all carbon atoms 
from the original glucose molecule 
degraded in glycolysis are already 
liberated incorporated into carbon 
dioxide molecules. That occurs because 
for each glucose two pyruvic acid 
molecules were made by glycolysis. 
Each of these two pyruvic acids then is 
converted into acetyl CoA with liberation 
of one carbon dioxide molecule (two in 
total). Since each of the two produced 
acetyl CoA cycles the Krebs cycle once, 
from the initial glucose two rounds of 
the Krebs cycle is generated and so four 
other carbon dioxide molecules are 
made.
All of the six carbons of the glucose 
molecule are then incorporated into six 
carbon dioxide molecules (two made 
during acetyl CoA formation and four 
during the two cycles of the Krebs 
cycle).
26. Where in mitochondria 
does the process called 
respiratory chain occur? 
Which are the products of the 
Krebs cycle used in that final 
phase of the aerobic 
respiration?
Respiratory chain, or the electron 
transport chain, is performed by protein 
systems located in the inner membrane 
of the mitochondria. Energized electrons 
of hydrogen atoms transported by 
NADH2 and FADH2 are the products of 
the preceding phases used in the 
respiratory chain.
27. What are cytochromes?
Cytochromes are proteins of the internal 
mitochondrial membrane that are 
specialized in electron transfer and 
participate in the respiratory chain. 
Energized electrons liberated by the 
hydrogen donors NADH2 and FADH2 
(then reconverted into NAD and FAD) 
pass through a sequence of 
cytochromes losing energy in each 
passage. The energy is then used in the 
synthesis of ATP.
28. How in the respiratory 
chain do electrons from FADH2 
and NADH2 passing through 
cytochromes liberate energy 
for the ATP synthesis? What is 
this ATP synthesis called?
FADH2 and NADH2 oxidate into FAD and 
NAD and liberate hydrogen ions and 
highly energized electrons in the 
beginning of the respiratory chain.
The energy lost by electrons that pass 
through the cytochromes is used to 
pump protons (hydrogen ions) out of 
the inner mitochondrial membrane (to 
the region between the inner and the 
outer membranes of the 
mitochondrion). Hydrogen concentration 
gradient between the inner and the 
outer spaces delimited by the inner 
membrane forces protons (hydrogen 
ions) to return to the mitochondrial 
matrix (the region inside the inner 
membrane) however that return is only 
possible if hydrogen ions pass through 
an enzymatic complex called ATP 
synthetase embedded in the inner 
membrane. In that passage the ATP

synthetase phosphorylates ADP and 
then ATP molecules are produced.
Hydrogen liberated in the mitochondrion 
then combines with oxygen to form 
water. As a reaction that depends on 
oxygen this type of ATP synthesis is 
called oxidative phosphorylation.
29. Until the Krebs cycle, 
aerobic respiration can be 
described without mentioning 
oxygen, the chemical element 
after which the reaction gets 
its name. Where in the 
process does this chemical 
element take part? What is its 
importance?
Oxygen enters the aerobic respiration in 
its final phase, the respiratory chain. It 
is of fundamental importance because it 
is responsible for the maintenance of 
the hydrogen concentration gradient 
between the spaces separated by the 
inner mitochondrial membrane. This 
gradient promotes the functioning of the 
ATP synthetase and thus the 
phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP. In 
the space inside the inner membrane 
oxygen binds to free hydrogens to form 
water and this hydrogen consumption 
keeps the hydrogen gradient and the 
proton traffic through the ATP 
synthetase.
The entire aerobic respiration process 
has the intent to make the ATP 
synthetase work. Aerobic beings, for 
example, we humans, need to breathe 
oxygen to maintain that hydrogen 
concentration gradient and keep the 
ATP synthetase working.
30. How does the poison 
cyanide act upon the aerobic 
respiration?
Cyanide is a poison that inhibits the last 
cytochrome of the respiratory chain, 
interrupting the ATP formation and thus 
leading the cell to death.
31. What is anoxia?
Anoxia is a situation in which there is no 
available oxygen in the cell. Whitout 
oxygen the respiratory chain stops, 
there is no ATP production, the cell does 
not obtain energy and dies.
Anoxia can be caused, for example, by 
pulmonary insufficiency (drowning, 
extensive pulmonary injuries, etc.), by 
obstructions, halts and deficiencies in 
tissue circulation (atherosclerosis of the 
coronary arteries that irrigate the 
myocardium, tourniquets, heart arrest), 
by hemolysis (lysis of red blood cell) or 
hemoglobin diseases (anemias, fetal 
erythroblastosis), etc.
32. How many ATP molecules 
are made after the aerobic 
respiration and what is the net 
energetic gain of the process?
After aerobic respiration 38 ATP 
molecules are made with the 
consumption of one glucose molecule 
(but two of these ATP are consumed by 
glycolysis). The net gain of the process 
is then 36 ATP molecules per glucose 
molecule.

equation of the aerobic 
respiration (also representing 
ADP and phosphate)?
The general equation of the aerobic 
respiration is:
C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 36 ADP + 36 P --> 
6 CO2 + 6 H2O + 36 ATP
34. Why can the consumption 
of molecular oxygen indicate 
the metabolic rate of aerobic 
organisms?
Molecular oxygen (O2) consumption has 
direct relation to the cell metabolic rate 
in aerobic cells and so to the metabolic 
rate of the organisms. Cells having 
higher metabolic activity demand more 
energy and such energy comes from 
ATP molecules. As there is need for ATP 
production, the intensity of aerobic cell 
respiration is also higher and then more 
oxygen is consumed.

Protein Synthesis
1. What is the genetic code?
Genetic code is the key for the 
conversion of DNA nucleotide sequences 
(and thus RNA nucleotide sequences) 
into amino acids sequences that will 
compose proteins.
2. Which is the biological 
molecule that contains the 
genetic information that is 
transmitted hereditarily and 
controls the cellular 
functioning?
The hereditary molecule that controls 
the cellular functioning is the DNA 
(deoxyribonucleic acid). The DNA 
contains information for protein 
synthesis in cells.
3. How are the concepts of 
DNA, gene, proteins and 
characteristics of living beings 
related?
Characteristics of organisms depend on 
chemical reactions that occur in them. 
These reactions are catalyzed by 
enzymes, highly specific proteins. Every 
protein of an organism is made from 
information contained in RNA molecules 
that are made according to a template 
sequence of nucleotides of a DNA chain.
A gene is a DNA polynucleotide 
sequence that contains information for 
the production of a protein.
4. What is the role of 
messenger RNA and 
ribosomes for the protein 
synthesis?
The mRNA is produced within the 
cellular nucleus and migrates to the 
cytoplasm where associated to 
ribosomes it guides the building of 
amino acid sequences that will compose 
proteins. Ribosomes are sites for the 
meeting and binding of mRNA and 
transfer RNA (tRNA), they are the 
structures where amino acids 
transported by tRNA are united by 
peptide bonds forming polypeptide 
chains (proteins).
5. Of what subunits are 
ribosomes are made?
Ribosomes are made of two subunits, 
the small subunit and the large subunit. 
These subunits are made of ribosomic 
RNA (rRNA) and proteins. Ribosomes 
have three binding sites, one for mRNA 
and two for tRNA.

energy). This explains why within those 
organelles there are DNA and protein 
synthesis machinery, including 
ribosomes. This hypothesis is known as 
the endosymbiotic hypothesis on the 
origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts.
8. What are some examples of 
human cells that produce 
proteins for exportation? 
Which cytoplasmic organelle 
is expected to be well-
developed and abundant in 
those cells?
Specialized cells of the glands, like the 
Langerhans cells of the pancreas (that 
produce insulin) or the saliva-producing 
cells, are examples of secretory cells. In 
cells specialized in secretion, the 
endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi 
apparatus are well-developed since they 
participate in the storage and 
processing of proteins for exportation.
9. Which are the more 
abundant ribosomes in 
secretory cells - the free 
cytoplasmic ribosomes or 
those associated with the 
rough endoplasmic reticulum?
Free cytoplasmic ribosomes are more 
related to protein production for internal 
cellular consumption while those 
adhered to the rough endoplasmic 
reticulum are more important in protein 
synthesis for exportation. Proteins made 
by adhered ribosomes enter the rough 
endoplasmic reticulum and are later 
transferred to the Golgi apparatus. So in 
secretory cells ribosomes adhered to the 
endoplasmic reticulum are more 
notable.
10. Where in eukaryotic cells 
does mRNA synthesis occur? 
To where do these molecules 
migrate?
Messenger RNA molecules are 
synthesized within the nucleus, pass 
through pores of the nuclear membrane 
and gain the cytoplasm to reach the 
ribosomes where protein synthesis 
occurs.

Biology Questions and Answers
11. After the fact that it is 
based on information from 
mRNA what is the process of 
protein synthesis called?
Protein synthesis is called translation (of 
genetic information into proteins).
12. What is the difference 
between transcription and 
translation?
Transcription is the name given to the 
formation of DNA molecules from an 
open DNA chain used as a template. 
Translation is the making of 
polypeptides (amino acids bound in 
sequence) and thus of proteins based 
on information encoded in the mRNA 
molecule.
In eukaryotic cells transcription occurs 
in the nucleus and translation occurs in 
ribosomes. Transcription precedes 
translation.
13. How do nucleotides of 
mRNA chains encode 
information for the formation 
of the amino acids sequences 
of a protein?
There are only four types of nitrogen-
containing bases that can compose RNA 
nucleotides: adenine (A), uracil (U), 
guanine (G) and cytosine (C). Amino 
acids however are 20 different ones. 
Considering only one nucleotide (a 1:1 
coding) it would be impossible to codify 
all amino acids.
Considering two nucleotides there would 
be an arrangement of 4 elements, 2 x 
2, resulting in a total of only 16 possible 
codifier units (4 x 4). Nature may know 
combinatory analysis since it makes a 
genetic code by arrangement of the 4 
RNA bases, 3 x 3, providing 64 different 
triplets (4 x 4 x 4).
So each triplet of nitrogen-containing 
bases of RNA codifies one amino acid of 
a protein. As these triplets appear in 
sequence in the RNA molecule, 
sequential amino acids codified by them 
are bound together to make polypeptide 
chains. For example, a UUU sequence 
codifies the amino acid phenylalanine, 
as well the UUC sequence; the ACU, 
ACC, ACA and ACG sequences codify the 
amino acid threonine; and so on for all 
possible triplet sequences and all other 
amino acids.
14. What is the name of an 
RNA sequence that codifies 
one amino acid?
Each sequence of three nitrogen-
containing bases of RNA that codifies 
one amino acid is called a codon. The 
codon is the codifier unit of the genetic 
code.

Biology Questions and Answers
15. Since among the 64 
codons of mRNA 61 codify 
amino acids that form 
polypeptide chains what are 
the functions of the three 
remaining codons?
Since there are 20 amino acids and 64 
possibilities of mRNA codons, it is 
expected some amino acids to be 
codified by more than one codon. And 
that really happens.
Not all 64 codons however codify amino 
acids. Three of them, UAA, UGA and 
UAG, work on information that the last 
amino acid of a polypeptide chain under 
productions was already bound, i.e., 
they signal the end of the polypeptide 
synthesis. These codons are called 
terminal codons. The codon AUG 
codifies the amino acid methionine and 
at the same time it signals the 
beginning of the synthesis of a 
polypeptide chain (it is an initialization 
codon).
In prokaryotic cells there is a sequence 
called Shine-Dalgarno sequence (in 
general AGGAGG) in the position that 
antecedes the initialization codon AUG. 
The function of this sequence is 
distinctness between the initialization 
AUG and other AUG codons of the RNA.
16. What is the cellular 
structure to which mRNA 
molecules bind to start the 
protein synthesis?
To make proteins mRNA molecules 
necessarily associate to ribosomes. 
Ribosomes have two sites for the 
binding of two neighboring mRNA 
codons and where anticodons of tRNA 
bind by hydrogen bond. Thus ribosomes 
are the structure responsible for the 
positioning and exposure of mRNA 
codons to be translated. In ribosomes 
the peptide bond between two amino 
acids brought by tRNA molecules also 
occurs. The peptide bond happens when 
tRNAs carrying amino acids are bound 
to exposed mRNA codons.
17. How are amino acids 
brought to the cellular site 
where translation takes place? 
What is an anticodon?
Amino acids are brought to ribosomes 
by RNA molecules known as transfer 
RNA, or tRNA. One tRNA associated to 
its specific amino acid binds by a special 
sequence of three nucleotides to a 
mRNA codon exposed in the ribosome. 
This sequence in the tRNA is known as 
anticodon. The tRNA anticodon must be 
complementary to the mRNA codon to 
which it binds, according to the rule A-
U, CG. The ribosome then slides along 
the mRNA molecule (a process called 
translocation) to expose the following 
codon to the binding of other tRNA. 
When amino acids corresponding to 
neighboring codons bind by peptide 
bond the first tRNa is liberated.

Biology Questions and Answers
18. Why is the proximity 
between ribosomes and amino 
acids important for the protein 
formation? What is the 
enzyme that catalyzes that 
reaction?
The proximity between ribosomes and 
amino acids is important because the 
enzyme that catalyzes the peptide bond 
resides in ribosomes. As substrates of 
these enzymes, amino acids need to 
bind to the enzyme activation centers.
The enzyme that catalyzes the peptide 
bond is the peptidyl transferase.
19. Why do ribosomes move 
along mRNA during 
translation?
During translation the ribosome always 
exposes two mRNA codons to be 
translated by moving along the mRNA. 
When a peptide bond is made the 
ribosome moves to expose the next 
codon. This moving is called ribosomal 
translocation. (In the rough 
endoplasmic reticulum ribosomes are 
attached outside the membrane and 
mRNA molecules rather moving through 
them).
20. How many of the same 
proteins are made at the same 
time by each ribosome in the 
translation of one mRNA 
molecule? How does 
consecutive protein 
production occur in 
translation?
Ribosomes do not make several 
different proteins simultaneously. They 
make them one after another.
Along one single mRNA molecule 
however many ribosomes may move in 
a real mass manufacturing of the same 
protein. The unit made of many 
ribosomes working upon the same 
mRNA molecule is called polysome.
21. An mRNA molecule 
codifies only one type of 
protein?
Eukaryotic cells have monocistronic 
mRNA, i.e., each mRNA codifies only 
one polypeptide chain. Prokaryotes can 
present polycistronic mRNA.
At the end of the assembling of amino 
acids into a polypeptide chain, the 
mRNA, by one of its terminal codons, 
signals to the ribosome that the 
polypeptide is complete. The ribosome 
then liberates the produced protein. In 
prokaryotes after this conclusion the 
information for the beginning of the 
synthesis of another different protein 
may follow in the same mRNA.

Biology Questions and Answers
22. If a tRNA anticodon is CAA 
what is its corresponding 
mRNA codon? For the genetic 
code which amino acid does 
this codon codify?
According to the A-U , C-G rule, the 
corresponding codon to the CAA 
anticodon is GUU.
The genetic code table for translation is 
related to codons and not to anticodons. 
The amino acid codified by GUU, 
according to the genetic code, is valine.
23. If a fragment of nucleic 
acid has a nucleotide 
sequence TAC can one assert 
that it is a codon or an 
anticodon?
A nucleic acid having a TAC sequence 
surely is not tRNA, it is DNA since RNA 
does not present the nitrogen-
containing base thymine. Since it is not 
RNA it cannot be a codon or an 
anticodon.
24. Why can the genetic code 
be qualified as a “degenerate 
code”?
The genetic code is a degenerate code 
because there are amino acids codified 
by more than one type of codon. It is 
not a system in which each element is 
codified by only one codifying unit.
For example, the amino acid arginine is 
codified by six codons: CGU, CGC, CGA, 
CGG, AGA and AGG.
25. What is the concept of 
universality of the genetic 
code? What are the exceptions 
to this universality?
The genetic code is universal because 
the rules of protein codification based 
on mRNA codons are practically the 
same for all known living beings. For 
example, the genetic code is the same 
for humans, for bacteria and for 
invertebrates.
The protein synthesis in mitochondria, 
chloroplasts and some protozoans 
however are accomplished by different 
genetic codification.
26. How does the universality 
of the genetic code make the 
recombinant DNA technology 
possible?
The universality of the genetic code 
refers to the fact that all living beings 
have their protein synthesis machinery 
functioning according to the same 
principles of storage, transmission and 
recognition of information, including 
translation of mRNA codons. This fact 
makes possible the exchanging of genes 
or gene fragments between different 
organisms and secures that these genes 
continue to command protein synthesis.
This universality, for example, makes 
feasible the insertion of a fragment of

human DNA containing a gene for the 
production of a given protein into the 
genetic material of bacteria. Since the 
bacterial transcription and translation 
systems work in the same manner as 
the correspondent human systems do, 
the bacteria will begin to synthesize the 
human protein related to the inserted 
DNA fragment. There are industries that 
produce human insulin (for use by 
diabetic patients) in this way, 
synthesized by bacteria with modified 
DNA. If the genetic code was not 
universal this kind of genetic 
manipulation would be impossible or 
very difficult to accomplish without new 
technological progresses.

Biology Questions and Answers
Bacteria
1. What are bacteria?
Bacteria are prokaryotic and unicellular 
beings. Bacteria have simple 
organization, they present an external 
cell wall, plasma membrane, circular 
DNA within the cytoplasm and 
ribosomes for protein synthesis. Some 
bacteria are encapsulated, i.e., they 
have a polysaccharide capsule outside 
the cell wall.
2. Are bacteria the only 
prokaryotic beings?
Prokaryotic beings are classified into 
two big groups: archaebacteria and 
bacteria (this last also known as 
eubacteria).
Compared to bacteria, archaebacteria 
have basic differences, like the chemical 
compositions of their plasma membrane 
and cell wall and different enzymes 
related to DNA and RNA metabolism.
3. What are halophile, 
thermoacidophile and 
methanogen archaebacteria?
There are three peculiar types of 
archaebacteria. The halophile 
archaebacteria only survive in salt-rich 
environments (even salinity of the sea is 
not enough for them). Thermoacidophile 
archaebacteria are characterized by 
living under high temperatures and low 
pH. The methanogen archaebacteria are 
those that liberate methane gas (CH4), 
they are found in swamps.
4. What are the main 
ecological roles of bacteria?
Bacteria are responsible for the 
decomposition process at the end of 
food chains and food webs; in this 
process, they also liberate utile gases 
and nutrients for other living beings. 
Bacteria that live within the digestive 
tube of ruminants and of some insects 
digest cellulose for these animals. Some 
bacteria also participate in the nitrogen 
cycle, making fixation of nitrogen, 
nitrification and denitrification, almost 
always in mutualist ecological 
interaction with plants. Bacteria present 
within living beings, for example, some 
that live inside the bowels, compete 
with other pathogenic bacteria so 
controlling the population of noxious 
agents. There are also bacteria that 
cause diseases and bacteria used in the 
production of medical drugs.
Excessive proliferation or mass 
destruction of bacteria can impact entire 
ecosystems. For example, when a river 
is polluted by organic material the 
population of aerobic bacteria increases 
since the organic material is food for 
them; the great number of bacteria 
then exhausts the oxygen dissolved in 
water and other aerobic beings (like 
fishes) undergo mass death.

Biology Questions and Answers
5. What are examples of 
human diseases caused by 
bacteria?
Some human diseases caused by 
bacteria are tuberculosis, pertussis, 
diphtheria, bacterial meningitis, 
gonorrhea, syphilis, bubonic plague, 
leptospirosis, cholera, typhoid fever, 
Hansen’s disease, trachoma, tetanus, 
anthrax.
6. What are some industrial 
processes that use bacteria?
Bacteria are used by industry in various 
ways. There are vaccines made of 
attenuated pathogenic bacteria or of 
antigens present in bacteria. One of the 
most ancient uses of bacteria is the 
fermentation of milk to produce yogurt, 
cheese and curd (even before the 
knowledge of the existence of bacteria 
these microorganisms were already 
used in the making of those products). 
Some methods of antibiotic production 
involve bacteria. The recombinant DNA 
technology (genetic engineering) allows 
the industrial production and 
commercialization of human proteins, 
like insulin for diabetics, synthesized by 
mutant bacteria. Some bacteria can 
produce fuel, like methane gas.
7. What are some mechanisms 
by which pathogenic bacteria 
cause diseases? Why is this 
knowledge important?
Pathogenic bacteria have characteristics 
known as virulence factors that help 
them to parasite their host. Some 
bacteria have fimbriae, cilium-like 
structures that attach the bacterial cell 
to the host tissue. There are bacteria 
specialized in intracellular parasitism. 
Other bacteria secrete toxins, molecules 
that cause disease; in some cases, the 
bacterial population growth causes food 
contamination by toxins. Generally, 
bacterial disease is caused by bacterial 
population growth with invasion and 
destruction of tissues or by bacterial 
toxins that contaminate the organism.
8. In which environments do 
bacteria live?
Bacteria can be found in various 
environments throughout the planet. 
There are bacteria in the air, in fresh 
water, on the surface, in the 
intermediate depth and on the bottom 
of the sea, in soils, in our skin and 
practically in all terrestrial environments 
through which air circulates freely. 
Some bacteria can be found in volcanic 
craters under extremely high 
temperatures.
9. How are bacteria classified 
according to the production of 
organic material for the 
energetic metabolism?
Most bacteria are heterotroph, they do 
not produce their own food. There are 
also autotroph bacteria: chemosynthetic 
bacteria or photosynthetic bacteria.
Some photosynthetic bacteria, like 
cyanobacteria, make photosynthesis like 
plants do, using water. Others, the

hydrogen sulfide (H2S) instead of water.
10. How are bacteria classified 
according to their need for 
oxygen?
According to their necessity of oxygen 
bacteria are classified into anaerobic 
(those that survive without oxygen) and 
aerobic (those that do not survive 
without oxygen).
11. What is meant when it is 
said that a bacteria is an 
obligate anaerobe?
Obligate anaerobes are those living 
beings that do not survive in the 
presence of oxygen. For example, the 
bacteria Clostridium tetani, agent of 
tetanus, is an obligate anaerobe.
In superficial wounds, it is commom to 
use hydrogen peroxide to expose 
anaerobic microorganisms to oxygen 
and kill them.
12. According to their 
morphology how are bacteria 
classified?
Bacteria present different morphological 
patterns. A bacterium can be classified 
into coccus, bacillus, vibrion or 
spirochete.
13. What is the main 
constituent of the cell wall of 
bacteria?
The bacterial cell wall is made of 
peptidoglycans.
14. Which are the intracellular 
organelles present in 
bacteria?
Considering typical eukaryotic cell 
organelles, heterotrophic bacteria have 
ribosomes, essential for protein 
synthesis.
15. What are plasmids? What 
is the importance of plasmids 
for the recombinant DNA 
technology?
Plasmids are circular fragments of DNA 
that are accessories to the main 
bacterial DNA. Plasmids are important 
for genetic engineering because genes 
from other organisms are inserted into 
them to produce recombinant beings, 
for example, mutant bacteria. These 
bacteria are made, for example, to 
produce utile proteins for humans on an 
industrial scale.
16. How do bacteria 
reproduce?
Bacteria reproduce by binary fission 
(scissiparity). Some bacteria however 
present a kind of sexual reproduction

(transformation, transduction or 
conjugation) with a combination of 
genetic material from different 
individuals.
17. How does sexual 
reproduction occur in 
bacteria? How different are 
the modalities of bacterial 
sexual reproduction?
Sexual reproduction occurs when 
bacteria incorporate genetic material 
into other bacteria of the same species; 
the inserted genetic fragment then 
becomes part of the genetic material of 
the second bacteria. This kind of 
reproduction can happen by means of 
transformation, transduction or 
conjugation.

Biology Questions and Answers
Protists
1. Which are the groups of 
living beings that form the 
protist kingdom?
The protist kingdom includes protozoans 
and algae. (Two groups of fungi with 
similar characteristics to protozoans, 
myxomycetes and oomycetes, have 
been classified as protists.)
Unicellular protozoans and algae are 
unicellular eukaryotes. The pluricellular 
algae are eukaryotes of simple structure 
too. It is believed that protists are 
phylogenetic ancestors of living beings 
of the other eukariotic kingdoms (fungi, 
animals and plants).
2. What is the fundamental 
difference between 
protozoans and algae?
The basic difference between 
protozoans and algae is the fact that 
protozoans are heterotrophs while algae 
are photosynthetic autotrophs.
3. What are the characteristics 
of protozoans that make them 
resemble animals?
Protozoans are unicellular beings with 
some similar characteristics to animal 
cells.
In comparison to pluricellular organisms 
protozoans are more proximal to the 
animal kingdom than to plants: they are 
heterotrophs, they have a rudimentary 
locomotion system (amoeboid 
movements, cilia, flagella), they do not 
have cell wall, some species present 
structures that resemble structures of a 
primitive digestive system, with 
cytostome (mouth) and cytopyge 
(anus), specialized in digestion and 
excretion.
The evolutionary hypothesis that animal 
cells have come from differentiation of 
protozoans is strong.
4. What is the basic 
morphology of a protozoan 
cell?
Protozoans are eukaryotic cells so they 
have organelles and structures common 
to this kind of cell: endoplasmic reticula, 
Golgi apparatus, digestive vesicles, 
ribosomes, mitochondria, nucleus with 
genetic material, karyotheca, etc. All 
these elements are found dispersed 
throughout the cytoplasm. Protozoans 
do not have cell walls.
Protozoans from the mastigophora 
group (like trichomonas) have flagella 
and others, others from the ciliated 
group (like paramecium) have cilia.
5. Do protozoans have a 
cellular nucleus?
All protozoans, as eukaryotes, have 
nucleus. Some species, like the

Biology Questions and Answers
paramecium, have two nuclei: the 
macronucleus and the micronucleus.
6. What are the respective 
functions of the macronucleus 
and of the micronucleus in the 
paramecium?
The macronucleus is properly the cell 
nucleus, it has DNA and RNA and acts 
as the center of the cellular control and 
regulation. The micronucleus has 
reproductive functions and it is related 
to the conjugation process (sexual 
reproduction).
7. What do protozoans “eat”? 
Do they move in search for 
food?
Protozoans are heterotroph beings, i.e., 
they do not make their own food and 
thus they need to search for it in the 
environment. Protozans have developed 
several locomotion mechanisms and 
they actively move towards food.
8. How do amoebae, 
paramecia and trichomonas 
respectively move?
Amoebae move by amoeboid 
movements, small projections and 
invaginations of their plasma membrane 
(pseudopods) that alter the external 
morphology of the cell making it move 
on surfaces. Paramecia have the outer 
face of their plasma membrane covered 
by cilia that flap helping the cell to 
move. Trichomonas are flagellated 
protozoans, i.e., they have relatively 
long filaments outside the cell that beat 
and make possible active swimming in 
fluid environments.
9. How is digestion performed 
in protozoans?
Digestion in protozoans is intracellular 
digestion: organic material is 
internalized and degraded inside the 
cell.
Protozoans get food by phagocytosis 
and then the food is digested when 
phagosomes fuse with lisosomes within 
the cell, forming digestive vacuoles. The 
digestive vacuoles give origin to residual 
bodies that are eliminated from the cell 
by exocytosis.
In the paramecium the entrance of food 
into the cell and the excretion of 
digestive residuals occur at specialized 
regions of the plasma membrane, the 
cytostom and the cytopyge, 
respectively.
10. Are protozoans presenting 
contractile, or pulsatile, 
vacuoles easily found in fresh 
or in salt water?
Fresh water is the less concentrated of 
solutes than sea water and it (fresh 
water) tends to be less concentrated 
than the intracellular environment 
making cells to swell. Sea water, on the 
other hand, since it is very concentrated 
tends to dehydrate the cell.

Transaction ID: 4KS71350WY6468607

Biology Questions and Answers
The vacuoles of protozoans are internal 
structures specialized in water storage 
that when necessary liberate water to 
the cytoplasm. Vacuoles thus can dilute 
the cytoplasm for it to enter into 
osmotic equilibrium with the 
environment. Protozoans of fresh water 
then need vacuoles more since their 
intracellular is hypertonic in relation to 
the exterior. Without the dilution 
mechanism provided by the vacuoles, 
protozoans of fresh water would absorb 
too much water and would die.
11. Do protozoans have sexual 
or asexual reproduction?
In protozoans reproduction is sexual or 
asexual. The most frequent form of 
sexual reproduction is binary division, or 
scissiparity, in which the cell divides 
itself by mitosis originating two 
daughter cells. Some species, like the 
plasmodium, agent of malaria, 
reproduce asexually by schizogony 
(multiple fission); in this form of 
reproduction the cell becomes 
multinucleated, generally inside a host 
cell, and each nucleus is expelled out 
together with cytoplasm portions giving 
rise to new protozoans.
The sexual reproduction in protozoans 
can happen by conjugation, with 
incorporation of genetic material from 
one cell into another, or by gametes 
that fecundate others and form zygotes. 
In the plasmodium sexual reproduction 
happens in the mosquito, the definitive 
host, and the zygote undergoes mitosis 
(sporogony) creating many sporozoites.
12. Which is the form of 
protozoan reproduction that 
generates more variability?
Sexual reproduction always generates 
more genetic variability than asexual 
reproduction. That is because in sexual 
reproduction the fusion of genetic 
material from different individuals 
occurs and so the offspring is not 
genetically identical to the parent cell.
If the hypothesis that protozoans 
originated multicellular animals is 
strong, other hypotheses may be even 
stronger: that these protozoans were 
able to reproduce sexually, since only 
genetic variation can produce biological 
differentiation to the point of creating 
new types of living beings.
13. What are the four groups 
of protozoans?
The four main groups of protozoans are 
the sarcodines (that form pseudopods, 
like amoebae), the mastigophores 
(flagellated, like the trypanosome that 
causes Chagas’ disease), the ciliated 
(like paramecia) and the sporozoans 
(spore-forming, like plasmodia).
14. Why are euglenas involved 
in polemics related to their 
taxonomic classification?
Euglenas are involved in taxonomic 
polemics because they tend to be 
classified sometimes as protozoans and 
sometimes as algae. Although they have 
chloroplasts and they are photosynthetic

autotrophic beings, euglenas do not 
have a cell wall and they can survive by 
“eating” substances from the 
environment when light is not available 
for photosynthesis. Curiously euglenas 
also have a photosensitive structure 
called stigma that orients the movement 
of the cell towards light. Nowadays 
euglenas are classified as algae, but it is 
suspected that they are common 
ancestors of algae and protozoans.
15. Do algae reproduce 
sexually or asexually?
There are algae that reproduce sexually 
and there are algae that reproduce 
asexually.
In unicellular algae reproduction is 
generally asexual by binary division.
In pluricellular algae asexual 
reproduction can occur by 
fragmentation or by sporulation.
In sexual reproduction of algae, uni or 
pluricellular, there is fusion of gametes 
(syngamy). There are algae in which all 
cells can become gametes and there are 
algae in which only some cells can play 
that role. Some species may present 
alternation of generations, forming 
gametophytes and sporophytes with 
different ploidies.
16. What is the commercial 
importance of algae?
Many algae have high nutritional value 
and are commercialized and consumed 
as human food, they are very popular 
food in the oriental world. Jelly 
compounds are extracted from some 
algae, like glues and pastes for 
industrial and commercial use.
The agar-agar, used as a medium for 
biological culture in laboratories and in 
medicines, and the substance known as 
carrageenin, a component of tooth 
pastes, cosmetics, paint and hygienic 
products, are extracted from 
rhodophyte algae. Diatom algae 
deposited on the bottom of the sea form 
diatomites, used in the production of 
filters, refractories, thermal isolation 
and cement. Some algae are used as 
agricultural fertilizers.
17. What is the phenomenon 
known as “red tide”? Which 
ambiental harms can it cause?
Red tide is a phenomenon that occurs 
when dinoflagellates (algae from the 
pyrrophyte group) proliferate 
excessively in the ocean. These algae 
liberate toxins that affect the nervous 
system and can cause death when 
ingested by marine animals and by 
humans that eat contaminated animals.

Biology Questions and Answers
Fungi
1. What are the main cellular 
features of fungi?
There are unicellular and pluricellular 
fungi. All fungi are eukaryotes and 
heterotrophs.
Fungi have cells with cell wall made of 
chitin, the same substance that 
constitutes the exoskeleton of 
arthropods. Fungi, likewise animals, 
characterize for storing glucose in the 
form of its polymer glycogen.
2. Are there photosynthetic 
fungi? How do fungi nourish 
themselves?
All fungi are heterotrophs (so, they do 
not perform photosynthesis). Fungi are 
typical decomposers, they eat and 
degrade organic material.
3. Fungi are classified in their 
own kingdom. Into which 
phyla is the fungi kingdom 
divided? Into which of those 
phyla are mushrooms 
classified?
The kingdom fungi is divided into four 
phyla: ascomycetes, basidiomycetes, 
zygomycetes and deuteromycetes.
Mushrooms are basidiomycetes.
4. What are the hyphae and 
the mycelium of pluricellular 
fungi?
The main structures of pluricellular fungi 
are the hyphae (threadlike filaments 
made of contiguous uni or 
multinucleated cells) and the mycelium 
(a set of hyphae).
5. What are the types of 
reproduction that occur in 
fungi?
In fungi there are asexual and sexual 
reproduction. Fungi reproduce asexually 
by fragmentation, gemmation and 
sporulation. Some species can 
reproduce sexually by fusion of hyphae 
from different individuals, even with 
metagenesis (alternation of 
generations).
6. What are the fruiting bodies 
present in some fungi?
Fruiting bodies are structures made of 
hyphae that project radially from the 
superior portion of the peduncle of some 
fungi. These structures contain the 
reproductive cells of the individual. They 
form the umbrella-like cap in 
mushrooms (basidiocarp) or the 
ascocarp in ascomycetes.
7. What is the ecological 
importance of fungi?

Biology Questions and Answers
Fungi are heterotrophs and 
decomposers (they break down dead 
beings) and they actively participate in 
the recycling of organic material in 
ecosystems. Some fungi keep mutualist 
ecological interaction with algae or 
cyanobacteria, forming lichen, and with 
plant roots, forming mycorrhizas.
8. What is the utility of fungi 
for some industries?
Fungi are industrially used in the 
production of fermented beverage, 
bread, cheese, etc. Some fungi are very 
important for the production of medical 
drugs. There are fungi processed to 
serve as food for humans, like eatable 
mushrooms.
9. What are lichens? How do 
fungi participate in this 
ecological interaction?
Lichens are formed by mutualist 
ecological interaction between fungi and 
algae or between fungi and 
cyanobacteria. In this ecological 
interaction, the fungi absorb water that 
is then used by algae (or 
cyanobacteria), and algae (or 
cyanobacteria), as autotrophs, produce 
organic material in excess to serve as 
food for the fungi.
10. What are mycorrhizas? 
How does each participant 
benefit in this ecological 
interaction?
Mycorrhizas are mutualist ecological 
interactions between fungi and some 
plants roots. Fungi provide to the plant 
more water and mineral salts and obtain 
organic material from the vegetable.
11. What are the main human 
diseases caused by fungi?
The main human diseases caused by 
fungi are coccidioidomycosis, 
histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, 
paracoccidioidomycosis, or South 
American blastomycosis, sporotrichosis, 
aspergillosis and systemic candidiasis.
Fungi are also responsible for many 
dermatologic diseases 
(dermatomycosis) that affect the skin, 
the nails, the scalp, etc.
On the other hand, many fungi are able 
to produce antibacterial substances that 
combat diseases. In the second world 
war, in German jails, Russian prisoners 
that accepted to eat moldy bread had 
less skin infection than those that 
refused the food. In China, moldy soy 
sauce has millennial past use against 
infections. Penicillin, a potent antibiotic, 
was discovered in 1928 by Alexander 
Fleming when he observed the 
antibacterial activity of fungi from the 
genus Penicillium.

12. What is cyclosporin? How 
are fungi related to this 
substance?
Cyclosporin is a drug discovered in the 
1970’s that revolutionized organ 
transplantation in Medicine. It is a 
powerful immunosuppressor and so it 
lessens the immune activity of the 
receptor and reduces the risk of 
rejection of the transplanted organ.

Biology Questions and Answers
Viruses
1. Are viruses cellular beings?
Viruses are considered living beings but 
they do not have cellular structure.
There is some controversy regarding 
their classification as living beings. Their 
characteristics of self-reproduction and 
of having genetic material however 
reinforce that classification.
2. What is the basic structure 
of a virus?
Viruses are constituted of genetic 
material (DNA or RNA) covered by a 
protein capsule also known as a capsid. 
Some viruses, like HIV, have in addition 
an external envelope derived from the 
plasma membrane of the host cell from 
which it came.
3. Are there non-parasitic 
viruses?
All viruses are obligate intracellular 
parasites, i.e., they depend on the host 
cell to complete their life cycle. A virus 
does not have its own metabolism.
4. Why is it a strong 
evolutionary hypothesis that 
although viruses are the 
structurally simplest beings 
they were not the first living 
beings?
The fact that viruses are obligate 
intracellular parasites makes very weak 
the hypothesis that virus appeared 
before cellular beings in the evolution of 
life.
5. What is the genetic material 
of a virus? How does that 
material act in viral 
reproduction?
There are DNA viruses (double strand or 
single strand DNA) and RNA viruses 
(double strand or single strand RNA 
too). Viruses inoculate their DNA or RNA 
molecules into cells and these cells (by 
means of transcription or reverse 
transcription and translation) synthesize 
proteins for the assembling of a new 
virus. This synthesis is commanded by 
the viral DNA or RNA molecules.
6. What is the typical 
reproduction cycle of a DNA 
virus?
A typical virus has proteins on its capsid 
that bind to the outer membrane of the 
host cell. In the place where the virus 
adhered viral proteins act to break the 
cell membrane and then the virus

Biology Questions and Answers
injects its DNA molecules into the host 
cell.
Within the host cell the viral DNA is 
transcripted and thus messenger RNA is 
produced. Viral mRNA then is translated 
and viral proteins are made.
Viral polypeptides made within the host 
cell are cut by enzymes called proteases 
and then copies of the virus are 
assembled with the newly formed 
proteins. When the assemblage of new 
viruses is completed the cell membrane 
breaks and the viruses are released to 
the outside. One sole infected cell can 
produce hundreds of viruses.
7. What are retroviruses? How 
do they reproduce and what is 
the role of the enzyme reverse 
transcriptase?
Retroviruses are viruses whose genetic 
material is RNA. HIV and the virus of 
SARS (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome) are examples of retrovirus.
These viruses inoculate their RNA into 
the host cell and within the cell the viral 
RNA is reversely transcripted into DNA. 
DNA made from the viral RNA then 
commands the synthesis of viral 
proteins for the assemblage of new 
viruses and the breaking of the host cell 
to liberate them outside.
The enzyme reverse transcriptase is the 
catalyst of the reverse transcription of 
RNA into DNA. The enzyme is part of 
the virus and it is also inoculated into 
the host cell.
8. What is the basic structure 
of the HIV virus? What is the 
function of the glycoproteins 
of its envelope?
HIV is an RNA virus. In its core there 
are two strands of RNA and reverse 
transcriptase molecules. The core is 
covered by a capsid, a layer of proteins. 
The capsid then is covered by an 
envelope having glycoproteins and 
lipids.
The glycoproteins of the HIV envelope 
are located on the outer surface of the 
virus and they are responsible for the 
recognition of the cells to be infected 
(the HIV host cell is the CD4 
lymphocyte) and for the adhesion of the 
virus to the cell membrane. (CD4 is a 
receptor glycoprotein of the outer 
membrane of some lymphocytes).
9. What are bacteriophages?
Bacteriophages are viruses specialized 
in parasitism of bacteria. They are used 
in genetic engineering as molecular 
cloning vehicles to insert recombinant 
DNA into bacteria. They were also used 
in the former Soviet Union to treat 
bacterial infections.
Bacteriophages have a polyhedron-like 
capsid and DNA as genetic material. The 
“head” of the virus is connected to a tail 
that ends in small fibers that help the 
virus to attach to the bacterial cell wall 
and to inject its genetic material into 
the host.

Biology Questions and Answers
10. What is meant when it is 
said that a virus is in an 
inactive state?
Viruses considered in inactive state are 
those whose genetic material is within 
host cells without synthesis of viral 
proteins and assemblage of new virus. 
The life cycle of these viruses can be 
activated under certain conditions and 
then synthesis of viral proteins begins 
and new copies are made.
The virus that causes herpes (herpes 
virus) is an example of a virus that 
stays in an inactive state and is 
sometimes activated.
11. What are the main human 
diseases caused by virus?
Among diseases caused by virus are 
common cold, mumps, variola 
(considered eradicated nowadays), 
rubella, measles, AIDS, the viral 
hepatitis, human papillomatosis (HPV 
infection), rabies, dengue fever, yellow 
fever, poliomyelitis (an almost 
eradicated disease in developed 
countries), hemorrhagic fever from 
Ebola virus, SARS (severe acute 
respiratory syndrome).
Viruses also cause many other diseases 
in animals and plants.
12. SARS is a disease that 
appeared in 2003 with 
epidemic features in the 
province of Guangdong, in 
east China. What type of agent 
causes SARS?
SARS is caused by a virus from the 
coronavirus group, a RNA virus 
(retrovirus). SARS can be fatal.
13. What is crystallization of a 
virus? What is the importance 
of this process?
Crystallization is the process of 
transformation of viral components into 
organized solid particles.
Crystallization of biological 
macromolecules, including viral 
components, is used to study structural 
characteristics, for example, through X-
rays, laser beams, etc.

Biology Questions and Answers
Life Kingdoms
1. What is the Biology field 
that studies the classification 
of living beings?
The Biology field that studies the 
classification of living beings is called 
Taxonomy.
2. Into which categories are 
living beings classified?
Living beings are classified, from the 
broader to the more particular category, 
into kingdom, phylum, class, order, 
family, genus and species (KPCOFGS 
can be used as mnemonic). Kingdom is 
the broadest category and the others in 
sequence are encompassed by the 
previous one.
3. What is meant by binomial 
nomenclature and what are its 
basic rules?
Scientific nomenclature of a species 
must have, at least, two names: one 
that classifies it as genus and the other 
that identifies it as species. The name 
related to genus is the first and must 
begin in uppercase, the other following 
names must be written in lowercase. 
Besides this rule, scientific names of 
species must stand out and be written 
either in italics or underlined or still 
bolded or between quotation marks.
For example, the scientific name of the 
human species is "Homo sapiens", 
indicating that it belongs to the genus 
Homo.
Scientific nomenclature of species is 
important because it universalizes the 
way to refer to a species making it 
easier for people of different languages 
and cultures to understand each other. 
Same species that have very different 
names in different regions of the planet 
can be identified easily by their scientific 
binomial name.
4. What are the five kingdoms 
into which living beings are 
divided? Which group of living 
being is out of this 
classification?
The five kingdoms of living beings are 
the kingdom Monera, the kingdom 
Protista, the kingdom Fungi, the 
kingdom Plantae and the kingdom 
Animalia.
Viruses are out of this classification and 
sometimes they are said to belong to 
their own kingdom, the kingdom Virus.
5. According to cellular 
organization how are living 
beings divided into two 
groups?
Cellular beings are divided into two 
groups: the prokaryotes, unicellular 
beings whose sole cell does not have a 
delimited nucleus, and eukaryotes, uni

or multicellular beings with cells having 
delimited nucleus.
6. Which are the beings that 
constitute the kingdom 
Monera?
The kingdom Monera is the kingdom of 
the prokaryotes, composed of bacteria 
and archaebacteria.
7. Which are the beings that 
form the kingdom Protista?
The kingdom Protista comprises 
protozoans and algae.
8. Which are the beings that 
form the kingdom Fungi?
The kingdom Fungi is formed by fungi.
9. Which are the beings that 
form the kingdom Plantae? 
Are algae part of this 
kingdom?
The kingdom Plantae is composed of 
plants.
Algae are classified into the kingdom 
Protista and not into the kingdom 
Plantae (they are not plants).
10. Which are the beings that 
form the kingdom Animalia? 
What are the two big groups 
into which this kingdom is 
divided?
The kingdom Animalia is the animal 
kingdom. Commonly the kingdom 
Animalia is subdivided into invertebrates 
and vertebrates.
11. What are the nine phyla of 
the kingdom Animalia?
The nine phyla of the animal kingdom 
are: Porifera (poriferans), Cnidaria 
(cnidarians), Platyhelminthes 
(flatworms), Nematoda (roundworms), 
Annelida (annelids), Mollusca 
(molluscs), Arthropoda (arthropods), 
Echinodermata (echinoderms) and 
Chordata (chordates).
12. What are the two mains 
divisions of the chordate 
phylum?
Chordates are divided into 
protochordates (cephalochordates and 
urochordates) and vertebrates.
13. What are the differences 
between vertebrates and the 
other chordates?
Vertebrates are different because they 
have a spinal column (vertebral 
column). In these animals the

substituted by the vertebral column in 
adults.
14. What are the five classes 
of vertebrates? To which of 
these do human beings 
belong?
The five classes of vertebrates are: 
fishes (osteichthyes and 
chondrichthyes), amphibians, reptiles, 
birds and mammals. Humans classify as 
mammals.
15. What is an evolutionary 
tree? Is there a precise 
evolutionary tree known by 
science that explains the 
emergence and origin of every 
type of living being?
Evolutionary tree is the pictorial and 
schematic representation of 
evolutionary relations among species of 
living beings in which the trunk (or a 
preceding branch) represents common 
ascendants of species and groups of 
living beings that are distributed along 
its branches according to hypothesis on 
their origin. For example, today it is 
admitted that birds and mammals are 
two distinct branches of the same 
preceding reptile branch.
Biology cannot assures a definite 
evolutionary tree (phylogeny) on the 
species of living beings that live or have 
lived in our planet. There are many data 
to be discovered and many knowledge 
gaps to be filled. One of the most 
promising methods to study phylogeny 
is the comparison of DNA molecules 
from different groups of living beings 
researching similarities and differences 
in nucleotide sequences that may 
indicate more or less relatedness among 
species.

Biology Questions and Answers
Poriferans
1. What are poriferans?
The phylum Porifera contains the 
simplest creatures of the animal 
kingdom. Sponges are aquatic sessile 
beings (they are not able to move by 
themselves and they keep themselves 
attached to substrates), they do not 
have tissue diversity and their bodies 
have pores (feature after which their 
name comes).
They are multicellular, like all beings of 
the animal kingdom.
2. What is the way of life of 
sponges?
Sponges live exclusively in an aquatic 
environment and they are attached by 
their base to a substrate (fixation 
ground). Sponges are filtering animals, 
they nourish themselves from nutrients 
that enter their atrium brought in with 
water.
3. What is the typical shape of 
poriferans?
Sponges have bodies in the form of 
tubular vases or globes open in the 
upper extremity. They have an internal 
central cavity and porous walls. The 
central cavity is called spongocoel and 
the opening in the upper extremity is 
called osculum.
4. How does water move 
inside sponges? What is the 
function of the pores in these 
animals?
Sponges are filtering beings. They make 
water enter their bodies by their lateral 
pores. Water then circulates inside the 
central cavity and exits through the 
osculum.
5. How do sponges try to 
protect themselves against 
harm from the environment? 
Is that method efficient or 
rudimentary?
Sponges can close their pores to avoid 
the entrance of water into their bodies 
in the presence of stimulus that may 
mean danger. This method however is 
rudimentary but it is actually a 
protection attempt against nocent 
agents.
6. What are the main cells of 
which poriferans are made?
Sponges have their outer wall covered 
by flat cells called pinacocytes and 
having pores well-delimited by special 
cells called porocytes. The internal wall 
is filled with choanocytes, flagellate cells 
specialized in phagocytosis of food 
brought to the central cavity; the 
choanocyte flagella also maintains the 
water flux inside the sponge.
Between the outer and the inner 
coverage of the poriferan body there are

Biology Questions and Answers
cells with amoeboid movement (by 
pseudopods), the amoebocytes; since 
they are embedded in connective 
matrix, amoebocytes move and 
distribute nutrients to other cells and 
they also produce spicules that like a 
primitive skeleton fill the tissue and 
support the body structure. (Some 
poriferans have an internal skeleton, an 
endoskeleton, made of spicules and 
organic fibers.)
7. Concerning digestion how 
are poriferans characterized?
Sponges are different from other 
animals since they present only 
intracellular digestion. They do not have 
a digestive system nor do they release 
digestive enzymes in the spongocoel to 
cause extracellular break down of 
nutrients.
8. How are animals divided 
according to their type of 
digestive process?
Apart from sponges, that do not have a 
digestive cavity where extracellular 
digestion takes place, all other animals 
have a digestive system with an internal 
cavity in which extracellular digestion 
occurs.
9. How are gases exchanged 
in sponges?
The gas exchange in sponges happens 
by diffusion from the exterior to the 
cells that absorb molecular oxygen and 
liberate carbon dioxide.
10. Do sponges have nervous, 
circulatory and excretory 
systems?
Sponges do not have a nervous system 
neither circulatory system nor excretory 
system.
11. Is reproduction in sponges 
sexual or asexual?
Reproduction in sponges can be asexual 
by budding, gemmation or 
fragmentation (regeneration) or sexual 
with larval stage (a ciliated 
amphiblastula larva).
12. What is the evolutionary 
advantage of the occurrence 
of sperm cells and larval stage 
in the life cycle of sponges?
The sexual reproduction in sponges, in 
addition to contributing to genetic 
variability, also facilitates the 
colonization of farther environments by 
these beings, since sperm cells and 
larvae are mobile and can swim in the 
exterior to compensate the immobility 
of the adult individual.

13. What is the economic 
importance of sponges?
Some chemical substances secreted by 
sponges have anti-inflammatory, 
antibiotic and anti-tumoral activities and 
they are used in the production of 
medicines. Since ancient times the 
endoskeleton of some sponges has had 
commercial value, they are used as 
cleansing implements for baths (bath 
sponges), to wash animals, objects and 
so on.
14. Sponge identity card. How 
are sponges characterized 
according to example of 
representing beings, basic 
morphology, type of 
symmetry, embryonic (germ) 
layers and coelom, digestive 
system, respiratory system, 
circulatory system, excretory 
system, nervous system and 
types of reproduction?
Example of representing beings: 
sponges. Basic morphology: tubular or 
globular body with spongocoel, sessile; 
choanocytes, pinacocytes and 
amoebocytes. Type of symmetry: not 
established. Germ layers and coelom: 
do not apply since poriferans do not 
have true tissue organization. Digestive 
system: nonexistent. Respiratory 
system: nonexistent. Circulatory 
system: nonexistent. Excretory system: 
nonexistent. Nervous system: 
nonexistent. Types of reproduction: 
asexual and sexual with larval stage.

Biology Questions and Answers
Cnidarians
1. What are some examples of 
cnidarians? In which 
environments can these 
animals be found?
Jellyfish, hydra, corals and sea 
anemones are good examples. All of 
them are aquatic and most live in the 
sea.
2. What are the two main 
morphological patterns of 
cnidarians? Concerning 
locomotion how do these 
forms differentiate from each 
other?
Morphologically, cnidarians classify as 
polyps or medusae. Polyps are 
cylindrical and medusae are circular 
convex, like an umbrella. Both shapes 
have tentacles.
In general polyps are sessile but some 
species, like hydra, can move by 
alternating contact points on the 
substrate and performing somersaults. 
Medusae can move expelling water jets 
by contraction of the body.
Some cnidarians alternate polypoid and 
medusoid forms in their life cycle.
3. Concerning tissue 
complexity how different are 
cnidarians from poriferans?
Cnidarians have true tissue 
differentiation, they present distinct 
organized tissues in the body. Poriferans 
present only some dispersed specialized 
cells with no tissue differentiation.
4. Which are the germ layers 
present in cnidarians? Which 
tissues of the animal do they 
originate?
These beings present ectoderm and 
endoderm, two germ layers. Animals 
with only two germ layers are called 
diploblastic animals.
The ectoderm gives birth to the 
epidermis and the endoderm originates 
the covering of the digestive cavity.
5. Why is the digestive system 
of these animals called 
incomplete?
Incomplete digestive system is that in 
which the digestive cavity has only one 
opening.

Biology Questions and Answers
6. What is the type of 
digestion that occurs in 
cnidarians?
These animals have a digestive cavity 
and they make extracellular and 
intracellular digestion. The extracellular 
digestion takes place within the 
digestive cavity.
7. What are cnidocytes? What 
is the name of the capsule 
inside the cnidocyte? What are 
the biological functions of this 
structure?
Cnidocytes are specialized cells present 
in coelenterates. They are found in the 
epidermis and contain toxic substances 
that can hurt, paralyze or even kill other 
animals.
Each cnidocyte has an internal capsule 
know as nematocyst where the actual 
urticating substance is stored. When a 
cnidocyte is excited it causes the 
nematocyst to expose a filament 
containing the toxic chemical.
Cnidocytes and their nematocysts have 
the biological functions of defending the 
individual from external aggression and 
of helping to capture their prey.
8. How is the nervous tissue 
distributed in cnidarians?
Their nervous system is diffuse, there 
are no brain or ganglia.
9. What are the types of 
reproduction presented by 
cnidarians?
They present asexual and sexual 
reproduction.
10. What is the type of 
asexual reproduction that 
occurs in hydras?
Hydras reproduce asexually by budding.
11. What is metagenesis? 
What are the other names of 
this process?
Metagenesis is the type of life cycle in 
which there are two different forms of 
individuals of the same species, one 
haploid and the other diploid. In one of 
these stages gametogenesis occurs and 
fecundated gametes give birth to the 
zygote that then develops into the other 
form. Metagenesis is also known as 
alternation of generations or as 
diplobiont life cycle. (All plants, for 
example, present metagenesis.)

there is alternation between polypoid 
and medusoid forms. The polyps 
reproduce asexually originating 
medusae that then liberate gametes. 
The male and female gametes unite 
under water to form the zygote that 
then develops into larva and later 
originates another polyp.
The form that reproduces asexually is 
the polyp. Polyps give birth to medusae 
by budding in Obelia and by 
strobilization in Aurelia.
13. What is the name of the 
larva of corals and sea 
anemones? What is the 
biological importance of that 
larval stage?
Sexual reproduction in corals and sea 
anemones have a larval stage and the 
larva is called planula.
Many marine animals are sessile or 
practically sessile, like sponges, corals 
and sea anemones. The mobile larval 
stage of their life cycle provides better 
spatial distribution of these species.
14. What are the main classes 
into which the phylum is 
divided? What are some 
examples of each and in which 
form (polyp or medusae) are 
they found?
Coelenterates are divided into three 
main classes: hydrozoans, scyphozoans 
and anthozoans. In hydrozoans the 
polypoid form predominates and 
examples are hydras, by-the-wind-
sailors and Obelia. In scyphozoans the 
main phase is the medusoid and the 
best known example is the common 
jellyfish (Aurelia). In anthozoans there 
is only the polypoid form and corals and 
sea anemones are notable in this group.
15. What does radial 
symmetry means? What is the 
type of symmetry found in 
chordates? Which are other 
phyla of the animal kingdom 
that present species with 
radial symmetry?
Radial symmetry means (biologically) 
that the animal structures are situated 
in a radial or circular pattern around a 
center point with nonexistence of sides, 
like right or left. An alternative type of 
symmetry in which structures are 
placed equally in the sides of a 
longitudinal axis is the lateral symmetry 
(the symmetry present in human 
beings, for example).
Chordates present lateral symmetry.
Besides cnidarians another animal 
phylum with species presenting 
secondary radial symmetry is the 
phylum Echinodermata. (It is considered 
that the simplicity of poriferans does not 
characterize any symmetry.)
16. What are corals?
Corals are characterized by their 
polypoid shape, sessility and slow 
growth and secretion of a solid skeleton

made of calcium carbonate. Numerous 
coral individuals associate in 
intraspecific harmonic ecological 
interaction forming colonies with 
hundreds, thousands and even millions 
of beings. Water-permeated solid 
structures of these colonies, known as 
reefs, work as true ecosystems for other 
living beings. The biggest known coral 
colony is the Great Barrier Reef in the 
northeast coast of Australia. There are 
however many coral species whose 
individuals live alone and do not form 
colonies.

according to examples of 
representing beings, basic 
morphology, type of 
symmetry, germ layers and 
coelom, digestive system,

Biology Questions and Answers
Platyhelminthes
1. What are the best known 
representatives of the 
platyhelminth phylum?
The most popular representatives of the 
platyhelminthes are worms that cause 
human diseases, like taenia and 
schistosome. The planaria, since it is 
been extensively studied in Biology, is 
also well known.
2. What is the main external 
morphological feature that 
differentiates platyhelminthes 
from other worms 
(nematodes)?
Platyhelminthes are also known as 
flatworms because they are worms with 
a flat body. This is the main external 
morphological feature that differentiates 
them from nematodes (roundworms).
3. How many germ layers 
originate the body of 
platyhelminthes? In relation 
to this characteristic how are 
these animals classified?
Platyhelminthes are the first triploblastic 
animals (remember that cnidarians are 
diploblastic), i.e., they present three 
germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm and 
endoderm.
4. What are the types of 
digestion and of digestive 
system of platyhelminthes?
Flatworms have incomplete digestive 
systems and they present extracellular 
and intracellular complementary 
digestions.
5. How are nutrients 
distributed by the digestive 
system in planarias?
Planarias have single opening digestive 
system (incomplete) with ramifications 
that transport nutrients to all areas of 
the body.
6. How is gas exchange done 
in flatworms?
Platyhelminthes exchange gases 
exclusively by diffusion through their 
body surface. This is only possible 
because all cells are localized relatively 
near to the exterior since gases diffuse 
cell by cell (the flat shape of these 
worms is a feature that allows this type 
of respiration).
7. Poriferans and cnidarians 
do not have excretory 
systems. Do platyhelminthes 
have an excretory system?
Platyhelminthes have a primitive 
excretory system made of flame cells

(also called solenocytes), excretory 
ducts and excretory pores.
8. What is an example of 
freshwater flatworm? Due to 
that habitat what is the 
physiological problem that 
these animals must solve?
Platyhelminthes of freshwater, like 
planarias, have an internal environment 
much more concentrated in solutes than 
the exterior and so they present a 
tendency to gain water. These 
organisms then need a drainage system 
to avoid cell death caused by excessive 
water.
The problem is solved by the presence 
of protonephridia located along 
longitudinal channels in the animal 
body. Protonephridia have ciliated cells, 
the flame cells, that push water outside 
the body through excretory pores.
9. Is the nervous system in 
platyhelminthes more or less 
sophisticated than in 
cnidarians? What are the main 
neural structures found in 
flatworms? How is this neural 
organization important for the 
diversity of biological niches 
explored by species of the 
phylum?
Platyhelminthes present a more 
sophisticated nervous system than 
cnidarians, as the first neural chords 
with ganglia (grouping of neurons) 
appear, a characteristic of the 
evolutionary process of increased 
nervous complexity. In platyhelminthes 
one can note the beginning of the 
cephalization process, with a 
concentration of neurons (nervous cells) 
in the anterior portion of the body and 
the appearance of photoreceptor cells in 
the ocelli.
With the increased capacity of these 
animals to perceive and to interact with 
the surrounds due to the increased 
complexity of their neural complexity, it 
is possible to find platyhelminthes in a 
variety of environments, including the 
terrestrial, and with diverse ways of life, 
like those that are parasites and those 
that are free-living.
10. What is cephalization? 
How does lateral symmetry 
favor cephalization?
Cephalization is the evolutionary 
tendency of concentration of the 
nervous command in central structures 
in which there are grouping of neurons 
(i.e, brain and ganglia formation). 
Evolutionarily the cephalization process 
begins with the appearance of ganglia 
(group of neurons) in platyhelminthes 
and reaches an apex in vertebrates, 
animals with a cranial box to protect the 
well-developed brain.
With lateral symmetry the body can be 
divided into lateral portions, superior, 
inferior, anterior and posterior. These 
portions must be integrated and 
controlled in some manner and this 
need stimulated the appearance of 
ganglial complexity and of beings with a 
head, a privileged extremity of the

bilateral body where the nervous central 
command and important sensory organs 
are located.
11. What is the type of 
reproduction, sexual or 
asexual, that occurs in 
platyhelminthes?
Platyhelminthes may present sexual or 
asexual reproduction.
12. How can asexual 
reproduction in planarias be 
described?
Planarias can divide themselves 
asexually by transversal bipartition due 
to the great regeneration capability of 
their tissues. When they attach to a 
substrate they can induce a constriction 
in their middle region and the body is 
then separated into two parts and each 
of these parts gives birth to a new 
individual as tissue regenerates.
13. Are flatworms monoecious 
or dioecious?
There are monoecious hermaphrodite 
flatworms, like planarias and taenias, 
and there are dioecious (having male 
and female individuals) species too, like 
schistosomes.
14. Is it possible for a 
hermaphrodite species to 
present cross-fecundation?
There are hermaphrodite species of 
animals and plants that present cross-
fecundation mainly due to the 
maturation of female and male 
structures at different periods.
Cross fecundation occurs in planarias, 
hermaphrodites in which sexual 
fecundation takes place with male and 
female gametes from different 
individuals. These individuals approach 
their copulating structures and 
exchange gametes.
15. What is direct 
development? Is there a larval 
stage in planarias?
Sexual reproduction with direct 
development is that in which there is 
not a larval stage in the embryonic 
development. When a larval stage exists 
it is said to be indirect development.
In the sexual reproduction of planarias 
there is no larval stage.
16. Into which classes are 
platyhelminthes divided? How 
are these classes 
characterized and what are 
some representative beings of 
each of them?
Platyhelminthes are divided into three 
classes: turbellarians (or Turbellaria), 
www.biology-questions-and-answers.com

Transaction ID: 4KS71350WY6468607

Biology Questions and Answers
trematodes (or Trematoda) and 
cestodes (or Cestoda).
Turbellarians are free-living 
platyhelminthes and their main 
representative is the planaria (Dugesia 
tigrina). Trematodes are parasites, they 
live inside a host and the schistosome 
(Schistosoma mansoni) that causes 
schistosomiasis is an example. Cestodes 
are parasites too, they do not have 
digestive tubes and their cells are 
nourished by absorption of nutrients 
from the host; their most popular 
representative are the beef and pork 
taenias (Taenia saginata and Taenia 
solium) that parasite humans.
17. What are the main human 
diseases caused by 
platyhelminthes?
The main human diseases caused by 
platyhelminthes are schistosomiasis, 
tapeworm disease (cestodiasis) and 
cysticercosis.
(Note:Diseases are studied in the 
“Diseases” division of this e-book.)

examples of representing 
beings, basic morphology, 
type of symmetry, germ layers

Biology Questions and Answers
Nematodes
1. What are examples of 
nematodes?
Ascaris, hookworm and filaria, all 
parasites of humans, are examples of 
nematodes (also known as 
roundworms).
2. Are nematodes exclusively 
parasites?
There are parasitic roundworms, 
including parasites of plants, but there 
are also free-living nematodes.
3. What is the typical 
morphological feature of 
nematodes that differentiates 
them from platyhelminthes?
Nematodes are also known as 
roundworms. As the name indicates 
they are not flat like platyhelminthes. In 
evolutionary grounds with the 
nematodes the first complete digestive 
system appears, with mouth and anus, 
and the pseudocoelom is also a novelty.
4. What are the morphological 
similarities and differences 
between nematodes and 
annelids?
Nematodes, like annelids, have a 
cylindrical elongated body. Annelids 
differentiate from nematodes by 
presenting a segmented body (body 
divided into metameres) and so they 
are called segmented worms.
5. Are nematodes diploblastic 
or triploblastic animals?
Just like platyhelminthes, nematodes 
are triploblastics, i.e., they present 
three germ layers (ectoderm, 
mesoderm and endoderm).
6. What is the main 
evolutionary innovation 
presented by nematodes? 
What is the advantage of that 
innovation?
The main evolutionary innovation of 
nematodes is the complete digestive 
system, with two openings (mouth and 
anus).
Since the ingestion and the defecation 
processes can occur in different 
extremities of the digestive tube, beings 
with a complete digestive system have 
the advantage of ingesting new food 
while residuals of already eaten food are 
still inside the body and not yet 
eliminated.

Biology Questions and Answers
7. Compared to 
platyhelminthes which 
physiological problem have 
the cylindrical body of 
nematodes brought? How was 
that problem solved?
The cylindrical shape of nematodes 
made impossible the respiration 
exclusively by simple diffusion among 
cells since there are tissues far from the 
exterior. This problem was solved by 
the presence of an inner cavity in the 
body filled with fluid, the pseudocoelom. 
The pseudocoelom has the function of 
distributing gases and nutrients to the 
body and to collect residuals, besides 
serving as a hydrostatic base to keep 
the worm shape.
(For the fact that the pseudocoelom 
fluid and the pseudocoelom do not 
characterize a true circulatory system 
with blood and heart it is not said that 
in nematodes the respiration is 
cutaneous; it is considered that these 
animals still make respiration by 
diffusion).
8. How does the excretory 
system of nematodes work?
The metabolic residuals of nematodes 
are collected by two longitudinal lateral 
excretory channels that open in one 
single excretory pore near the mouth.
9. How is the nervous system 
of nematodes organized? 
Where are the neural chords 
located in their body?
Roundworms have a ganglial nervous 
system with an anterior neural ring 
representing (evolutionarily) a primitive 
cephalization.
Nematodes have two main longitudinal 
ganglial chords that extend one dorsally 
and the other ventrally under the 
epidermis. There may also be nerves 
lateral to these main chords. The 
nervous system of a free-living 
nematode, “Caenorhabditis elegans”, 
has been well-studied in 
neurophysiological research and 
presents 302 neurons.
The nematode “C. Elegans” was the 
organism used in the research on the 
genetic regulation of organogenesis and 
apoptosis whose researchers won the 
Nobel prize of Medicine in 2002 
(Brenner, Horvitz and Sulston).
10. What is the type of 
reproduction that occurs in 
roundworms? What typical 
feature do nematode sperm 
cells have?
Nematodes reproduce sexually. The 
nematode sperm cell does not have cilia 
nor flagella and they move by amoeboid 
movement forming pseudopods.

Biology Questions and Answers
Annelids
1. What are some examples of 
annelids?
Earthworms, leeches and lugworms.
2. Which are the 
morphological features that 
differentiate the beings of the 
phylum Annelida from 
nematodes and 
platyhelminthes?
Platyhelminthes are worms with flat 
bodies (flatworms), nematodes are 
worms with cylindrical but not 
segmented bodies (roundworms). 
Annelids are cylindrical worms with 
segmented bodies (they are 
metameric).
3. What is the main 
evolutionary novelty 
presented by annelids?
The main evolutionary novelty 
presented by the beings of the phylum 
Annelida is the coelom, the internal 
body cavity totally covered by 
mesoderm, a feature also present in 
arthropods, molluscs, echinoderms and 
chordates. Platyhelminthes are 
acoelomate and nematodes are 
pseudocoelomate (their internal cavity 
is partially covered by mesoderm).
Another important evolutionary novelty 
of the annelids is the closed circulatory 
system.
4. What is the morphological 
characteristic that 
evolutionarily approximates 
the beings of the phylum 
Annelida to arthropods?
The metameric feature, i.e., the body 
segmentation in metameres, 
approximates annelids to arthropods 
since these animals are segmented 
beings too. (Bristles present in 
oligochaete and polychaete annelids are 
also covered with chitin, the same 
substance of the arthropod 
exoskeleton.)
5. How does digestion in 
beings of the phylum Annelida 
work and which type of 
digestive system do they 
have?
Digestion in beings of the phylum 
Annelida is extracellular. These animals 
have a complete digestive system, with 
mouth and anus.
6. Which are the 
characteristics and organs of 
the digestive system of 
earthworms related to the 
type of diet of these animals?

Biology Questions and Answers
Earthworms eat decomposing organic 
material and small organisms ingested 
together with soil particles. The 
digestive tubes of earthworms have 
special structures, like a muscular wall 
and a gizzard, that triturate the food 
and scratch it against the ingested soil 
particles. Since annelid digestion is 
exclusively extracellular earthworms 
also present in the posterior part of 
their digestive system structures like 
the cecum and the typhlosole that have 
the function of increasing the absorption 
surface of the intestine.
7. The vascular lesions caused 
by leeches upon the blood 
vessels of their host cause 
blood naturally to coagulate. 
How does the leech solve this 
problem since it could be 
expected that the ingested 
blood would coagulate inside 
its body?
Ingested blood does not coagulate 
inside the leech (Hirudo medicinalis) 
because in its saliva there is a potent 
anticoagulant substance, a protein 
called hirudin.
In the past leeches were largely used as 
medical treatment. Nowadays 
hirudotherapy is being used in patients 
with extensive and chronic inflammation 
of the skin, in prevention against tissue 
necrosis after some surgeries and in 
several others fields of Medicine.
8. How is the respiratory 
system of beings of the 
phylum Annelida 
characterized?
Respiration in annelids can be 
cutaneous or branchial. Cutaneous 
respiration occurs due to the rich 
vascularity under the epidermis. The 
gills, present in aquatic annelids, are 
located in the parapodia (false claws) 
that have an extensive capillary net.
9. What is meant when it is 
said that beings of the phylum 
Annelida are vascular beings? 
From which other phyla of the 
animal kingdom does this 
feature differentiate them?
The classification of these beings as 
vascular beings means that they have a 
circulatory system, with vessels that 
distribute substances throughout the 
body.
Poriferans, cnidarians and flatworms do 
not have a circulatory system. In 
nematodes there is circulation of gases 
and nutrients through the pseudocoelom 
fluid.
10. How are the circulatory 
systems of animals classified?
A circulatory system is classified as 
open or closed. In open circulatory 
systems blood gets out of vessels and 
flows also to large cavities that perfuse

the tissues to be irrigated. In closed 
circulatory systems blood circulates only 
within blood vessels and through the 
heart.
11. What is the type of 
circulatory system present in 
annelids?
In beings of the phylum Annelida the 
circulatory system is closed, i.e., blood 
circulation takes place only within 
specialized vessels.
12. Is there a respiratory 
pigment in the annelid blood?
The blood in beings of the phylum 
Annelida contains the respiratory 
pigment hemoglobin (the same found in 
chordates) and other pigments too.
13. How can the presence, 
localization and function of 
muscular tissue in beings of 
the phylum Annelida be 
explained?
In these beings there are a longitudinal 
muscular layer under the epidermis and, 
internally juxtaposed and perpendicular 
to it, another circular (radial to the axis) 
muscular layer. The circular muscle 
layer has the function of elongating the 
body while the longitudinal shortens it. 
By alternating actions both promote 
movement.
14. How can the excretory 
system of annelids be 
described?
In each segment (metamere) of the 
being a pair of complete excretory 
structures called metanephridium exists. 
The metanephridium has an extremity, 
the nephrostoma, which collects 
residuals from the coelom, filtering 
them and causing reabsorption along its 
extension (similar to human nephron 
tubules). The material to be excreted 
goes out through a pore, the 
nephridiopore, which opens in the body 
surface.
15. How is the nervous system 
characterized in beings of the 
phylum Annelida? How can 
one compare cephalization in 
annelids to cephalization in 
nematodes and 
platyhelminthes?
Annelids have a nervous system made 
of two ventral chords and one relatively 
big nervous cell concentration in its 
anterior portion resembling a primitive 
brain.
Nematodes have an anterior neural ring 
connected to two neural chords, a 
ventral and a dorsal one, while in 
planarias (platyhelminthes) there are 
only two small anterior “cerebral” 
ganglia from which neural chords split. 
Cephalization in annelids thus is more 
outstanding than in nematodes or in 
flatworms.

16. What is the clitellum of 
earthtworms and where it is 
located?
The clitellum is a special region of the 
annelid constituted by rings 
(metameres) with reproductive function. 
It can be found in the anterior portion of 
the animal and it is characterized by a 
lighter color in comparison to the 
normal color of the other segments.
17. Concerning the occurrence 
of separated sexes how are 
the beings of the phylum 
Annelida classified?
These beings may be dioecious (the 
majority of polychaetes) or 
hermaphrodite monoecious 
(oligochaetes and hirudineans).
18. Is the embryonic 
development in earthworms 
direct or indirect?
In earthworms there is no larval stage, 
so the embryonic development is direct.
19. What is the name of the 
larval stage of polychaetes?
Among the annelid classes only 
polychaetes present a larval stage. Their 
larva is called trocophore.
20. What is the ecological role 
of earthworms?
Earthworms have an important 
ecological role as they eat decomposing 
organic material. They also dig tunnels 
in the subsoil allowing the entrance of 
gases and nutrients that are useful for 
plant roots and other living beings. So 
they act as decomposers and as 
fertilizers too.
21. Into which classes is the 
phylum Annelida divided?
The phylum is divided into three 
classes: oligochaetes (for example, 
earthworms), hirudineans (e.g., 
leeches) and polychaetes (these are 
mostly marine aquatic with parapodia, 
like nereis).

Biology Questions and Answers
Arthropods
1. What are some examples of 
arthropods?
Ants, flies, cockroaches, shrimps, crabs, 
spiders and scorpions are examples of 
arthropods.
2. What are the classes into 
which the phylum Arthropoda 
is divided? What are the three 
main ones and some of their 
representative species?
The three main classes of arthropods 
are: insects (cockroachs, ants, flies, 
bees, beetles, butterflies), crustaceans 
(crabs, lobsters, shrimps, barnacles) 
and arachnids (scorpions, spiders, 
mites). Other classes are 
onychophorans (velvet worms), 
diplopods (millipedes) and chilopods 
(centipedes).
3. What are the main 
morphological features of 
arthropods?
Arthropods present three distinguishing 
features: they are metameric beings 
(segmented body), they have an 
exoskeleton made of chitin and they 
present articulated limbs.
4. Concerning germ layers and 
the presence of coelom how 
are arthropods characterized?
Arthropods are triploblastic (they have 
three germ layers) and coelomate 
beings.
5. Considering the presence of 
segmentation (metameres) in 
their body to which other 
already studied phylum are 
arthropods proximal?
Considering their metameric feature 
arthropods are proximal to annelids that 
also have segmented bodies. In the 
embryonic development of some 
arthropods there are fusions of 
metameres forming structures like, for 
example, the cephalothorax of 
arachnids.
6. What is the external rigid 
carapace of arthropods called? 
Of which substance is it 
made? Which type of organic 
molecule is that substance?
The external carapace of arthropods is 
called exoskeleton. The arthropod 
exoskeleton is made of chitin, a 
nitrogen-containing polysaccharide.

Biology Questions and Answers
7. How do arthropods grow?
Due to the presence of exoskeleton the 
growth of an arthropod is periodical. 
During the growth period the animal 
loses the exoskeleton, grows and 
develops a new exoskeleton. This 
process is named ecdysis, or molting.
8. How does the presence of 
exoskeleton explain the 
general small size of 
arthropods?
Since they have exoskeleton and 
periodic ecdysis, the growth of 
arthropods is limited to avoid the animal 
becoming vulnerable to environmental 
harm. There are however some 
arthropod species with relatively large-
sized individuals, like “giant” 
cockroaches, crabs and spiders.
9. How can the features of the 
arthropod exoskeleton explain 
the terrestrial adaptation of 
some species of the phylum?
In the arthropod exoskeleton there is a 
layer of wax which is impermeable. This 
feature was fundamental for primitive 
arthropods from the sea to survive on 
dry land without losing excessive water 
to the environment.
10. What is the type of 
digestive system present in 
beings of the phylum 
Arthropoda? Are these 
animals protostomes or 
deuterostomes?
The digestive tube of arthropods is 
complete, containing mouth and anus. 
Arthropods are protostome animals, i.e., 
in their embryonic development the 
blastopore originates the mouth.
11. How is the extracorporeal 
digestion associated to 
predation in arachnids?
Arachnids can inoculate poison to 
paralyze or kill their preys using 
structures called chelicerae. The prey is 
partially digested outside the body of 
the arachnid by digestive enzymes 
inoculated together with the venom or 
injected posteriorly. After this 
extracorporeal digestion the food is 
ingested and gains the digestive tube of 
the predator where the extracellular 
digestion continues.
12. Which organs or 
respiratory adaptations do 
aquatic and terrestrial 
arthropods respectively 
present?
In crustaceans, typical aquatic beings, 
there are richly vascularized gills that 
make contact with water and permit gas 
exchange. In terrestrial insects the 
respiration is tracheal and gases flow

Biology Questions and Answers
inside small tubes that connect the 
animal external surface and ramify to 
tissues and cells without the 
participation of blood. In arachnids, 
besides the tracheal respiration, book 
lungs (thin folds resembling leaves in a 
book) may also exist.
13. In arthropods why isn't 
gas exchange done through 
cutaneous diffusion?
In arthropods the impermeability of the 
exoskeleton makes the passage of 
gases difficult. In addition the new 
methods of respiration present in 
arthropods were preserved by evolution 
because they were more efficient for 
those animals.
14. What is the type of 
circulatory system present in 
arthropods? Do these animals 
have heart and respiratory 
pigments?
In arthropods the respiratory system is 
open (lacunar). Blood, also known as 
hemolymph, is pumped by a heart and 
falls into cavities (lacunas) irrigating 
and draining tissues.
All arthropods have a heart. 
Crustaceans and arachnids have 
respiratory pigments. Insects do not 
have respiratory pigments since their 
blood does not carry gases (in them 
gases reach tissues and cells through 
tracheal structures).
15. What are respiratory 
pigments? What is the 
respiratory pigment present in 
some arthropods? Which is 
the analogous molecule in 
humans?
Respiratory pigments are molecules able 
to carry oxygen and other respiratory 
gases present in circulatory fluids.
In crustaceans and in arachnids 
hemocyanin is the respiratory pigment. 
In humans the analogous pigment is 
hemoglobin.
16. How is the respiratory 
system of insects (with its 
independence between 
circulation and respiration) 
related to the motor agility of 
some species of this arthropod 
class?
Even having low speed and low pressure 
circulatory system, since it is a lacunar 
(open) circulatory system, insects 
perform extremely fast and exhaustive 
movements with their muscle fibers, like 
wing beating. This is possible because in 
these animals the respiration is 
independent from the open circulation. 
Gas exchange is done with great speed 
and efficiency by the tracheal system 
that puts cells in direct contact with air. 
Muscles can then work fast and hard.

Biology Questions and Answers
17. How are the excretory 
systems of the three main 
arthropod classes constituted?
In crustaceans a pair of excretory 
organs called green glands exists. The 
green glands collect residuals from the 
blood and other parts of the body. They 
are connected by ducts to excretory 
pores located under the base of the 
antennae and these pores release the 
excretions outside.
In insects small structures called 
malpighian tubules gather wastes from 
the blood and throw them into excretory 
ducts that open in the intestine. In 
these animals excretions are eliminated 
together with feces.
In arachnids, besides malpighian 
tubules, there are coxal glands located 
in the cephalothorax near the limbs that 
also participate in excretion.
18. What are the noteworthy 
features of the nervous 
system of arthropods?
In arthropods the nervous system has 
more sophisticated sensory receptors 
with well-advanced cephalization. In the 
anterior region of the body there is a 
fusion of ganglia forming a brain 
connected to two ventral ganglial chains 
having motor and sensory nerves.
The boosted development of the 
sensory system of arthropods provides 
more adaptive possibilities for these 
animals to explore many different 
environments.
19. What are compound eyes?
Arthropods have compound eyes made 
of several visual units called ommatidia. 
Each ommatidium transmits visual 
information through the optic nerve to 
the brain, which interprets the image. 
Because they are round and numerous, 
these ommatidia, whose external 
surfaces point in different directions 
creating independent images, cause 
arthropod eyes have a large visual field, 
larger than the visual field of 
vertebrates. Some insects have one or 
more simple eye besides their pair of 
compound eyes.
20. How is arthropod 
reproduction characterized?
Reproduction in beings of the phylum 
Arthropoda is sexual, with larval stage 
in some insects and crustaceans 
(arachnids present only direct 
development).
21. What are the types of 
fecundation that occur in 
arthropods? What is the 
predominant type?
In arthropods there are species having 
external fecundation and other species 
having internal fecundation. Internal 
fecundation is predominant.

22. How is fecundation done 
in insects (external or 
internal)? Is there copulation 
between insects?
Fecundation in insects is internal, with 
copulation.
23. How are the main classes 
of arthropods classified 
according to the presence of 
larval stage in their embryonic 
development?
In crustaceans there are species with 
direct and others with indirect 
development. In insects there are 
species without larval stage (ametabolic 
insects), others undergoing indirect 
development beginning with an egg 
stage followed by a nymph stage 
(hemimetabolic insects) and others with 
indirect development beginning with the 
larval stage (holometabolic insects).
The transformation of a larva into an 
adult individual is called metamorphosis. 
Hemimetabolic insects undergo 
incomplete metamorphosis while 
holometabolic insects undergo complete 
metamorphosis.
24. What are nymph and 
imago?
Nymphs are larvae of hemimetabolic 
insects (like grasshoppers). They are 
very similar to the adult insect although 
smaller. In holometabolic insects (like 
butterflies) the larva makes a cocoon 
(chrysalis, pupa) where it lives until 
emerging into the adult form. Imago is 
the name given to the adult form of 
insects with indirect development.
25. Is the stage when an 
insect larva is within a cocoon 
a stage of total biological 
inactivity?
The period when the larva is within its 
cocoon is a time of intense biological 
activity since the larva is being 
transformed into an adult animal.
26. How are the three main 
arthropod classes 
characterized according to the 
presence of wings?
Crustaceans and arachnids do not have 
wings. Most insects have wings.
27. Most insects have wings. 
Which is the other animal 
phylum that contains 
creatures with analogous 
organs?
Besides the phylum Arthropoda another 
animal phylum with flying creatures is 
the chordate phylum, birds and 
chiropterans mammals (bats) have 
wings. In the past some reptiles that 
possibly originated the aves had wings 
too. There are also amphibians and 
fishes that jump high exploring the 
aerial environment.

28. How are the three main 
arthropod classes 
characterized according to the 
presence of antennae?
Crustaceans have two pairs of 
antennae; insects have one pair; 
arachnids do not have antennae.
29. How are the three main 
arthropod classes 
characterized according to the 
body division?
In crustaceans and arachnids the head 
is fused with the thorax forming the 
cephalothorax. Their body thus is 
divided into cephalothorax and 
abdomen.
In insects there are head, thorax and 
abdomen.
30. How are the three main 
arthropod classes 
characterized according to the 
number of limbs?
Most crustaceans have five pairs of 
limbs. Insects have three pairs and 
arachnids present four pairs of limbs.
31. Which arthropod class is 
the most diversified animal 
group of the planet? How can 
this evolutionary success be 
explained?
The insects are the animal group with 
most diversity of species. Almost 
750000 insect species are known, about 
55% of the total already cataloged 
species of living beings (compare with 
mammals, with no more than 4000 
known species). It is calculated however 
that the number of unknown species of 
insects may be over 2 million. The 
insect population on the planet is 
estimated to be more than 10 quintillion 
(1000000000000000000) individuals.
The great evolutionary success of 
insects is due to factors such as: small 
size and alimentary diversity, making 
possible the exploration of numerous 
different ecological niches; wings that 
provided more geographic spread; the 
tracheal respiration that gave them 
motor agility; high reproductive rates 
with production of great numbers of 
descendants.
32. What are some examples 
of beings of the phylum 
Arthropoda that present a 
high level of behavioral 
sophistication?
Insects like some species of bees, 
wasps, ants and termites form societies 
that include hierarchy and job division 
among members. Spiders build 
sophisticated external structures, webs, 
mainly to serve as a trap for capturing 
prey. Another example is the

Biology Questions and Answers
Molluscs
1. What are some 
representatives of the phylum 
Mollusca?
Snails, octopuses, squids and oysters 
are examples of molluscs.
2. In which habitats do 
molluscs live?
Molluscs can be found in the sea, 
freshwater and in terrestrial 
environments.
3. What is the morphological 
feature of molluscs after 
which the phylum is named?
The word “mollusc” means “soft thing”. 
Molluscs have soft bodies and this 
feature explains the name of the 
phylum.
4. What are the biological 
troubles that molluscs face 
due to their soft body?
Because molluscs have a soft body they 
are more fragile. They also have more 
difficulty to support their bodies in 
terrestrial environments or to fixate to 
substrates in aquatic habitats. Many 
species solve these problems by 
secreting a calcareous carapace, or 
shell, an exoskeleton to support and 
protect them and to prevent 
dehydration.
5. Are mollusc metameric 
beings? Exclusively analyzing 
this feature could it be said 
that molluscs are 
evolutionarily proximal to 
nematodes or to annelids?
In molluscs there is not a body divided 
into segments. Considering just this 
feature it could be said that 
evolutionarily they are more proximal to 
nematodes than to annelids.
6. Into which classes are 
mollusc divided? What are 
some representing beings of 
each class?
The phylum Mollusca is divided into five 
main classes: pelecypods, or bivalves 
(Pelecypoda, or Bivalvia), includes 
oysters, clams, mussels; gastropods 
(Gastropoda), snails, sea slugs; 
cephalopods (Cephalopoda), squids, 
octopuses; scaphopods (Scaphopoda), 
tooth shells; Polyplacophora, chitons. 
There are a few other mollusc classes.

Biology Questions and Answers
The body of gastropods is divided into 
three main portions: head, the visceral 
mass and foot.
8. What is the type of 
digestive system in molluscs?
Molluscs present extracellular digestion 
and a complete digestive system, with 
mouth and anus.
9. What is the radula? What is 
the function of this organ?
Some molluscs have a tongue-like 
structure with harsh saliences similar to 
small teeth. This structure is called 
radula. The radula projects outside and 
helps to scrape food.
10. How is the respiratory 
system in aquatic molluscs 
characterized? What adaptive 
respiratory structure do 
terrestrial molluscs present?
Aquatic molluscs oxygenate their blood 
through gills in direct contact with 
water. In terrestrial molluscs the rich 
vascularity under the mantle cavity 
absorbs air doing the role of a primitive 
lung.
11. Which type of circulatory 
system do molluscs have? 
How can it be compared to the 
respiratory system of 
annelids?
Molluscs, with the exception of 
cephalopods, have an open circulatory 
system, i.e., the blood circulates within 
vessels, from the heart, but it also fills 
open lacunas or cavities. In annelids the 
circulatory system is closed, i.e., the 
blood circulates only inside blood 
vessels.
12. How is the large size of 
some cephalopods related to 
the type of circulatory system 
they present?
In cephalopods the circulatory system is 
closed and this provides more speed 
and pressure for the blood circulation 
allowing the existence of species with 
large bodies, like octopuses and giant 
squids.
13. How is the excretory 
system of molluscs 
characterized?
Molluscs have one or two pair of 
spongelike nephridia, similar to kidneys.

Biology Questions and Answers
14. What type of exoskeleton 
do some molluscs present?
Some molluscs, like bivalves and 
gastropods, secrete an external 
calcareous carapace (the shell). Calcium 
carbonate is secreted by the mantle, a 
fold in the epidermis, forming the shell.
In pelecypods, the shell is made of two 
valves that articulate and contain the 
individual body within. In gastropods 
the shell contains only part of the body, 
the visceral mass.
15. Do octopus and squids 
have exoskeleton?
Octopus and squids generally do not 
produce external shell (some squid 
species can have an internal shell). One 
cephalopod group, the nautiluses, 
produces an external spiral shell.
16. Which other phylum of the 
animal kingdom present 
species with exoskeleton?
Arthropods present exoskeleton made of 
chitin. Echinoderms do not have 
exoskeleton but they present a 
calcareous endoskeleton. Some 
chordates also have an external 
carapace.
17. What is the function of the 
feet in molluscs? How is the 
mollusc foot related to the 
name given to the classes of 
the phylum?
The mollusc foot has the function of 
locomotion, support, fixation, digging in 
the environment and sometimes of 
holding prey.
The terminations of the names given to 
the main mollusc classes come from the 
Greek word “podos” that means foot. 
Gastropods have feet in their ventral 
region (as the name indicates); 
pelecypods have ax-shaped feet (ax in 
Greek is “pelekys”); in cephalopods the 
feet are near the head.
18. How is the nervous system 
of molluscs organized?
Molluscs have well-developed sensory 
structures. It is accepted that 
cephalopods, like octopus and squid, 
have eyes with image formation. Snails 
have antennae and a pair of well-
defined eyes. Bivalves do not present 
eyes but they have photosensitive and 
tactile cells.
Cephalization is evident in molluscs and 
neurons concentrate in a ganglial 
pattern.

ecological and economic 
importance of molluscs?

Biology Questions and Answers
Molluscs are important players in 
several food chains in ecosystems. Many 
marine molluscs are part of a common 
human diet, like octopus and squid, 
very appreciated in the East, and 
oysters and mussels, consumed all 
around the world. Besides molluscs that 
are part of the food industry, pearls 
made by oysters have high commercial 
value.
20. How are natural and 
artificial pearls created?
Pearls are made from small strange 
particles that deposit between the shell 
and the mantle of the oyster. These 
particles trigger a defense process by 
the organism and they are gradually 
covered by calcium carbonate layers 
secreted by the oyster thus giving birth 
to pearls.
In the artificial production of pearls a 
small fragment of shell covered with 
mantle pieces is inserted between the 
shell and the mantle of an oyster and a 
pearl is formed around the graft.
21. Mollusc identity card. How 
are molluscs characterized 
according to examples of 
representing beings, basic 
morphology, type of 
symmetry, germ layers and 
coelom, digestive system, 
respiratory system, circulatory 
system, excretory system, 
nervous system and types of 
reproduction?
Examples of representing beings: snails, 
sea slugs, octopuses, squids, mussels, 
oysters. Basic morphology: soft body, 
with or without calcareous shell. Type of 
symmetry: bilateral. Germ layers and 
coelom: triploblastics, coelomates. 
Digestive system: complete. Respiratory 
system: branchial or, in terrestrial 
gastropods, lungs. Circulatory system: 
open or, in cephalopods, closed. 
Excretory system: nephridia. Nervous 
system: ganglial, advanced

Biology Questions and Answers
Echinoderms
1. What are some 
representatives of the 
echinoderm phylum?
Starfishes, sea cucumbers 
(holothurians), sea urchins and brittle 
stars are examples of echinoderms.
2. Under which environments 
do echinoderms live?
Echinoderms are marine animals, they 
live in salt water.
3. What are the basic 
morphological features of 
echinoderms?
Echinoderms, as the name indicates 
(echino = spiny, derma = skin), are 
creatures with spines originated from an 
endoskeleton. Their endoskeleton is 
made of calcareous plaques that besides 
spines contain pedicellaria, small pincers 
used to clean the body and to help the 
capturing of prey. They also present a 
hydrovascular system known as the 
ambulacral system. Adult echinoderms 
have pentaradial symmetry; the radial 
symmetry in these animals is 
secondary, present only in adults.
4. How can the endoskeleton 
of echinoderms be 
characterized in comparison 
to analogous structures 
present in vertebrates, 
arthropods and molluscs?
The echinoderm skeleton is internal, 
i.e., it is an endoskeleton. It is made of 
calcium carbonate (calcareous).
Vertebrates also have internal skeleton 
made of bones and cartilages. 
Arthropods have an external carapace 
made of chitin, a chitinous exoskeleton. 
Some molluscs present a calcareous 
shell that works as exoskeleton.
5. What is the system that 
permits movement and 
fixation to echinoderms?
The system that permits movement and 
fixation to substrates in echinoderms is 
called the ambulacral system. In these 
animals water enters through a 
structure called madreporite, passes 
through channels and reaches the 
ambulacral feet in the undersurface of 
the body. In the ambulacral region in 
contact with the substrate, there are 
tube feet filled and emptied by water 
thus acting as suckers.

Biology Questions and Answers
6. What is the type of 
digestive system of 
echinoderms?
Echinoderms present a complete 
digestive system, with mouth and anus.
7. Do sea urchins have teeth?
Sea urchins have a teeth-like structure 
juxtaposed to the mouth and made of 
five teeth connected to ossicles and 
muscle fibers. This structure, known as 
Aristotle’s lantern, is use to scratch 
food, mainly algae, from marine rocks.
8. What is the embryonic 
characteristic that 
evolutionarily makes 
echinoderms proximal to 
chordates?
Echinoderms and chordates are 
deuterostomes, i.e., in their embryonic 
development the blastopore turns into 
the anus. All other animals with 
complete digestive system are 
protostomes, i.e., their blastopore 
originates the mouth.
The blastopore is the first opening of 
the digestive tube that appears in the 
embryonic development.
9. Do echinoderms have 
respiratory and circulatory 
systems?
In echinoderms there are not well-
defined respiratory (with the exception 
of the holothurian group) and 
circulatory systems. The ambulacral 
hydrovascular system plays the function 
of these systems.
10. Do echinoderms have an 
excretory system? How is 
excretion done in these 
animals?
Echinoderms do not have an excretory 
system. Their excretions are eliminated 
by diffusion.
11. How are the symmetry and 
the nervous system 
characterized in echinoderms?
Adult echinoderms, along with 
cnidarians, are the animals that present 
radial symmetry, i.e., their body 
structures are distributed around a 
center. The radial symmetry in 
echinoderms however is a secondary 
radial symmetry, since their larval stage 
has bilateral symmetry and the radial 
pattern appears only in adult individuals 
(there are some few adult echinoderms 
with lateral symmetry). All other 
animals have lateral symmetry with 
exception of poriferans (no symmetry is 
defined for them).
Echinoderms do not present 
cephalization and they have a diffuse 
network of nerves and neurons made of 
a neural ring around the mouth and of 
radial nerves that ramify to follow the 
pentaradial structure of the body.

12. Do echinoderms present 
internal or external 
fecundation? Is there sex 
division among individuals?
The fecundation in echinoderms is 
external, gametes are liberated in water 
where fecundation occurs.
The majority of echinoderms are 
dioecious with male and female 
individuals.
13. Is there a larval stage in 
echinoderms?
In echinoderms embryonic development 
is indirect, with ciliated larvae.
14. What are the classes into 
which the phylum

Biology Questions and Answers
Chordates
1. What are the two main 
subdivisions of the phylum 
Chordata?
The phylum Chordata is divided into 
protochordates (urochordates and 
cephalochordates) and vertebrates 
(cyclostomes, fishes, amphibians, 
reptiles, birds and mammals).
2. What are the three 
structures shared by every 
chordate that characterize the 
group?
All beings of the phylum Chordata have 
branchial clefts in the pharynx (in some 
species present only in the embryo), 
notochord (substituted by the spinal 
column in vertebrates) and dorsal 
neural tube.
3. What is the destination of 
the branchial clefts in 
humans?
In humans the branchial clefts located 
in the anterior region of the pharynx 
(also known as pharyngeal clefts) are 
present only in the embryonic stage and 
disappear later.
4. What is the destination of 
the notochord in vertebrates 
and in protochordates?
In vertebrates the notochord disappears 
and gives birth to the spinal column 
(vertebral column). In protochordates 
the notochord remains for the rest of 
the life.
5. Is the tubular-dorsal 
nervous system of chordates 
associated to radial or lateral 
symmetry? How does that 
explain the complexity level of 
the nervous system reached 
by the vertebrate evolutionary 
branch?
The tubular and dorsal nervous system 
of chordates is related to the 
cephalization in these animals and to 
bilateral symmetry.
The presence of neural integrating 
centers with concentration of neurons in 
the brains and the spinal cord (central 
nervous system, CNS) allowed the 
increase of the interaction complexity 
between these animals and the 
environment. Receptor (afferent 
conduction) and efferent (motor, 
regulatory and behavioral reactions) 
functions come out more sophisticated 
in chordates due to the presence of 
more well-developed neural networks. 
These features have been preserved by 
evolution as they provide adaptive 
advantage to their owners.

Biology Questions and Answers
6. How can the tubular-dorsal 
nervous system in chordates 
be compared to the nervous 
pattern present in 
invertebrates?
In chordates the nervous system is 
dorsal and highly cephalized while in 
most invertebrates the nervous system 
is ganglial and ventral.
7. What is the group of the 
phylum Chordata that first 
colonized the terrestrial 
environment? From which 
habitat did they come?
Amphibians, partially aquatic partially 
terrestrial animals, were the first 
chordates that colonized the dry land. 
They came from the aquatic habitat and 
were originated from fishes. 
(Nevertheless the first completely 
terrestrial chordates were the reptiles).
8. How do chordates 
reproduce?
Reproduction in beings of the phylum 
Chordata is sexual, with the exception 
of urochordates that can also reproduce 
asexually. In some classes 
(cyclostomes, osteichthyes fishes and 
amphibians) there is larval stage. With 
rare exceptions, fishes, amphibians, 
reptiles and monotreme mammals are 
oviparous, egg-laying (embryos develop 
within eggs and outside the mother’s 
body) and marsupial and placental 
mammals are viviparous (embryos 
develop inside the mother’s body, 
feeding from her).
9. Into which subphyla are the 
protochordates divided? What 
are some representatives of 
each protochordate 
subphylum?
Urochordates (or tunicates) and 
cephalochordates are the two subphyla 
into which protochordates are divided.
Ascidians, sessile animals similar to 
sponges, are examples of tunicates. The 
amphioxus, well-studied in Embryology, 
is an example of cephalochordate.
10. What are the six criteria 
used to build a complete 
evolutionary branch of 
vertebrates?
Dichotomy in each of the six following 
criteria builds the vertebrate 
evolutionary branch: absence of 
mandibles separates cyclostomes from 
others; absence of limbs separates 
fishes from the remaining; absence of 
osseous skeleton separates 
chondrichthian (cartilaginous) fishes 
from osteichthyes; absence of 
impermeable skin separates amphibians 
from the terrestrial vertebrates; 
absence of warm blood (homeothermic 
body) separates reptiles from birds and 
mammals; absence of mammary glands 
and hair separates birds from 
mammals.

Biology Questions and Answers
11. Evolutionarily 
protochordates may be 
intermediate animals between 
invertebrates and vertebrates. 
Imagine a scientist is testing 
the hypothesis that 
vertebrates evolved from 
echinoderms. Having as 
research object a newly found 
protochordate species, what is 
an example of a discovery that 
would weaken the hypothesis? 
What is an example of a 
discovery that would 
strengthen it?
Hypothesis to be tested: Vertebrates 
evolved from echinoderms. Testing 
material: A newly found protochordate 
species (i.e., a vertebrate forerunner).
Example of weakening observation (that 
puts the new protochordate species 
evolutionarily far from echinoderms): 
“The new species is protostome”, as 
opposed to echinoderms, that are 
deuterostomes. This observation brings 
the suspicion that deuterostomy in 
vertebrates is independent in origin 
from echinoderms.
Example of strengthening observation 
(that nears the new protochordate 
species to echinoderms): “The new 
species has secondary radial 
symmetry”, similar to echinoderms. This 
observation makes stronger the 
hypothesis that echinoderms and 
vertebrates are relatives.
(This item shows how science works, 
beginning with the placement of 
hypothesis and further observational 
testing.)

Examples of representing beings: 
protochordates (ascidians, amphioxus), 
vertebrates. Basic morphology: 
branchial clefts, notochord, neural tube. 
Type of symmetry: bilateral. Germ 
layers and coelom: triploblastics, 
coelomates. Digestive system: 
complete, deuterostomes. Respiratory 
system: branchial (in aquatic), 
cutaneous (in adult amphibians), 
pulmonary (others). Circulatory system: 
open in protochordates, closed in 
vertebrates. Excretory system: diffusion 
and flame cells in protochordates, 
kidneys in vertebrates. Nervous system: 
neural tube in embryos, cerebral vesicle 
and single ganglion in protochordates,

Biology Questions and Answers
Fishes
1. What are the two main 
classes into which fishes are 
divided?
Fishes are divided into two main 
classes: chondrichthyes, fishes with 
cartilaginous skeletons (sharks, rays, 
dog-fishes), and osteichthyes, bony 
fishes (tuna, sardines, salmons).
2. From which features do 
condrichthyes and 
osteichthyes get these names?
“Chondros” means cartilage, “ictis” 
means fish (both from the Greek); the 
name chondrichtians is for fishes with 
cartilaginous endoskeleton. The name 
osteichthyes comes from the existence 
of a bony endoskeleton in these fishes 
(“osteo” means bone, from the Greek 
too).
3. What are the main features 
of fishes associated to the 
habitat where they live?
Fishes are all aquatic animals and thus 
they have a hydrodynamic elongated 
body suitable to move under water, 
without limbs and with fins. The habitat 
conditions the branchial respiration too.
4. Comparing to cyclostomes 
(primitive vertebrates) what 
are the main novelties 
presented by fishes?
Compared to cyclostomes, evolutionary 
novelties presented by fishes are: 
pectoral and pelvic fins, symmetric and 
paired; the presence of mandibles.
5. How different are the 
swimming strategies in 
osteichthyes and in 
chondrichthyes? Why do 
sharks need to agitate their 
body to swim while bony 
fishes do not?
Bony fishes have a specialized organ 
called a gas bladder, or swim bladder, 
whose interior can be filled with gas 
liberated from gas glands. The swim 
bladder works as a hydrostatic organ 
since it varies the relative density of the 
body regulating buoyancy and the depth 
of the animal in water.
Chondrichthyes do not have swim 
bladders and thus they must 
continuously agitate their body to keep 
swimming and maintain their depth in 
water. As an additional swimming aid, in 
chondrichthyes the liver is big and oily; 
this feature helps to reduce their body 
density relative to water.

Biology Questions and Answers
6. How does the swim bladder 
of fishes work allowing fishes 
to control their depth under 
water?
From Hydrostatics it is known that an 
object does not sink if its density is 
equal or less than the density of the 
fluid in which it is immersed.
When the swim bladder is filled by gas it 
reduces the density of the fish body and 
when it is emptied this density is 
increased. So this mechanism controls 
the fish depth under water.
7. How do fishes do gas 
exchange?
Fishes “breath” through gills. Gills, or 
branchiae, are highly vascularized 
organs specialized in gas exchange 
under water and present in aquatic 
animals (marine annelids, crustaceans, 
fishes and tadpoles). Gills are a 
respiratory organ (analogous, for 
example, to lungs) containing very thin 
lamellae with many apparent blood 
vessels in direct contact with water.
In osteichthyes the gills are covered by 
a bony flap that protects them called 
operculum. In chondrichthyes there are 
no opercula.
8. Do fishes present an open 
or closed circulatory system? 
How many chambers does a 
fish heart have? How does 
blood flow throughout the fish 
body?
As in every vertebrate the circulatory 
system of fishes is closed, i.e., blood 
flows only within blood vessels.
The fish heart has only two consecutive 
chambers: a thin-walled atrium and a 
muscular ventricle. The arterial 
(oxygenated) blood comes from the gills 
and gains arteries towards tissues, then 
venous blood is collected by veins and 
reaches the atrium of the heart passing 
to the ventricle that pumps the venous 
blood towards the gills to be again 
oxygenated.
9. How is excretion done in 
fishes?
Fishes have a pair of kidneys that 
filtrate the blood. Bony fishes excrete 
nitrogen as ammonia, NH3, (they are 
ammoniotelic) and cartilaginous fishes 
excrete urea as nitrogen waste (they 
are ureotelic, like adult amphibians and 
mammals).
10. What are the lateral lines 
of fishes?
The lateral lines of bony fishes are 
sense organs that extend along both 
sides of the animal body. They make 
contact with the environment by a 
series of specialized scales that transmit

information about pressure variation 
and vibrations in the surrounding water.
11. How different are 
fecundation in osteichthyes 
and in chondrichthyes?
In chondrichthyes fecundation is 
internal by means of copulation. In 
osteichthyes fecundation generally is 
external and the gametes are released 
in the water, where they can fecundate 
their counterpart and form the zygote.
12. Fish identity card. How are 
fishes characterized according 
to examples of representing 
beings, basic morphology, 
skin, respiration, circulation, 
nitrogen waste, thermal 
control and types of 
reproduction?
Examples of representing beings: 
sharks, rays, sardines, tuna, salmons. 
Basic morphology: hydrodynamic body, 
fins; cartilaginous skeleton in 
chondrichthyes, bony skeleton in 
osteichthyes. Skin: with scales in 
osteichthyes and placoid scales in 
chondrichthyes. Respiration: branchial. 
Circulation: closed, incomplete, heart 
with two chambers. Nitrogen waste: 
urea in chondrichthyes, ammonia in 
osteichthyes. Thermal control: 
heterothermic. Types of reproduction: 
sexual, internal fecundation in 
chondrichthyes, external in 
osteichthyes.

Biology Questions and Answers
Amphibians
1. Which is the chordate class 
considered an evidence of the 
transition of the vertebrates 
from the aquatic to the dry 
land environment?
The amphibians are totally aquatic in 
the larval stage and partially terrestrial 
animals as adults and for these facts 
they are considered intermediate beings 
in the evolutionary passage of 
vertebrates from the aquatic to the dry 
land habitat. Amphibians are also the 
first tetrapod animals, i.e., the first with 
two pair of limbs, a typical feature of 
terrestrial vertebrates. The name 
“amphibian” comes from the double life 
(aquatic as larvae and partially 
terrestrial as adults) of these animals.
2. What are the amphibian 
features that make them 
dependent on water to 
survive?
Permeable skin, body subject to 
dehydration, external fecundation, eggs 
without shells and larval stage with 
branchial respiration are features that 
make amphibians dependent on water 
to survive.
3. Do amphibians have direct 
development?
In amphibians the embryonic 
development is indirect (there is a larval 
stage).
4. How different are the 
respiration in fishes and the 
respiration in adult 
amphibians?
In fishes gas exchange is done by direct 
contact of water with the branchiae 
(gills). Gases gain and exit the 
circulation through the gills.
In adult amphibians gas exchange is 
done through the moist and permeable 
skin (cutaneous respiration) and also 
through the lungs, a set of tiny airway 
terminations associated to a highly 
vascularized tissue specialized in gas 
exchange.
The axolotl is an exotic amphibian found 
in Mexico that lives in water and 
“breathes” through gills even as an 
adult.
5. How is respiration 
performed by the larva of 
amphibians?
The larva of amphibians has exclusively 
branchial respiration. This is one of the 
reasons why it depends on water to 
survive.

Biology Questions and Answers
6. How different is the 
amphibian heart from the fish 
heart?
The fish heart has only two chambers, 
an atrium and a ventricle, and the blood 
that comes to it is purely venous.
In amphibians there are three heart 
chambers (a second atrium is present) 
and there is arterial blood coming from 
the lungs; in these animals the heart 
has two atria (one that gets blood from 
the body and other that gets blood from 
the lungs) and one ventricle; arterial 
blood mixes with venous blood within 
the ventricle which in turn pumps the 
blood to the lungs and to the systemic 
circulation.
7. How is excretion done in 
amphibians?
Adult amphibians have kidneys that 
filter blood. Nitrogen waste is excreted 
as urea (so amphibians are ureotelic 
beings). The larvae, aquatic, excrete 
ammonia.
8. Is fecundation in 
amphibians external or 
internal? In this aspect are 
amphibians evolutionarily 
proximal to fishes or to 
reptiles?
In the majority of the amphibian species 
fecundation is external. This feature is 
common to bony fishes too and it shows 
that the reproductive system and the 
embryonic development of amphibians 
are a heritage from osteichthyes.
Curiously although having external 
fecundation amphibian male and female 
copulate to stimulate the liberation of 
sperm and egg cells. This phenomenon 
does not characterize internal 
fecundation since the gametes unite in 
water.
9. Why is the occurrence of 
eyelids in amphibians in 
comparison to their absence in 
fishes an adaptation to 
terrestrial life?
Eyelids associated to lacrimal glands 
protect and keep eyes lubricated against 
damage from the great luminosity of 
terrestrial environments. Fishes do not 
have eyelids since their eyes are in 
constant contact with the fluid medium.
10. What are the problems 
that vertebrates needed to 
solve to adapt to the 
terrestrial environment since 
they came from the aquatic 
habitat? How does evolution 
solved those problems?
The main problems vertebrates coming 
from water needed to solve to adapt to 
the terrestrial environment were the 
following: the problem to avoid 
dehydration; the problem of elimination 
of wastes in a medium where water is 
less available; the problem of protection 
against nocent solar radiation; the 
problem of gamete locomotion in the

environment for fecundation; the 
problem of gas exchange, earlier done 
by direct contact of water with gills; the 
problem of body support, since it was 
water that played this role in fishes.
Solutions for the dehydration problem: 
thicker and impermeable skin, to lose 
less water, or moist and permeable 
skin, like in amphibians. Solution for the 
excretion problem: excretion of urea 
(also excreted by chondrichthyes) or 
uric acid, substances that need less 
water to be dissolved. Solutions for the 
problem of protection against radiation: 
skin pigments that filter harmful 
radiation, feathers, hair or carapaces. 
Solution for the gamete movement 
problem: internal fecundation (except 
for most amphibians, that have external 
fecundation). Solution for the gas 
exchange problem: appearing of 
airways and lungs. Solution for the body 
support problem: further development 
of muscular and bony structures, like 
limbs and claws.
11. Amphibian identity card. 
How are amphibians 
characterized according to 
examples of representing 
beings, basic morphology, 
skin, respiration, circulation, 
nitrogen waste, thermal 
control and types of

Examples of representing beings: frogs, 
toads, salamanders. Basic morphology: 
two pairs of limbs, eyelids, 
hydrodynamic larvae. Skin: moist and 
permeable, mucous glands. Respiration: 
cutaneous and pulmonary, branchial in 
larval stage. Circulation: closed, 
incomplete, heart with three chambers 
without interventricular septum. 
Nitrogen waste: urea. Thermal control:

Biology Questions and Answers
Reptiles
1. Which is the vertebrate 
class that is considered the 
first entirely terrestrial?
The first entirely terrrestrial vertebrate 
class, totally independent from the 
aquatic habitat, is the class Reptilia.
2. Compared to amphibians 
what is an example of 
evolutionary novelty present 
in beings of the class Reptilia 
against the loss of water 
through the skin?
The reptile skin is keratinized and 
impermeable to water while the 
amphibian skin is permeable. The skin 
impermeability made impossible the 
cutaneous gas exchange performed by 
amphibians and respiration became 
dependent on internal organs like 
airways and lungs.
3. What are examples of a 
carnivorous and a herbivorous 
reptile?
Snakes are carnivorous. Iguanas are 
herbivorous.
4. Do beings of the class 
Reptilia perform gas exchange 
in the same way amphibians 
do?
These beings do not have permeable 
skin so they do not make cutaneous 
respiration like amphibians do. Just like 
in birds and in mammals, their 
respiration is pulmonary.
5. How is the circulatory 
system of reptiles 
characterized? What is the 
basic difference between the 
reptile and the amphibian 
heart?
The circulatory system of beings of the 
class Reptilia is similar to the 
amphibian, closed and incomplete. 
Although the heart presents three 
chambers (two atria and one ventricle) 
in reptiles there is a beginning of 
ventricular septation and the mixture of 
arterial with venous blood is lessened.
6. Which is the type of 
nitrogen waste eliminated by 
beings of the class Reptilia?
These beings excrete mainly uric acid. 
This substance is less toxic than 
ammonia and it can be kept stored for a 
longer time inside the individual, 
including within eggs. In addition uric 
acid is practically insoluble and it 
depends less on water to be eliminated.

7. How has the importance of 
the brain evolved from fishes 
to reptiles?
From the least to the most complex 
brain structure, it is evident that the 
brain, from fishes to beings of the class 
Reptilia, became larger and 
predominant in the central nervous 
system.
8. How is reproduction done in 
beings of the class Reptilia?
These beings reproduce sexually 
through internal fecundation by means 
of copulation between male and female 
individuals. They lay eggs with shell and 
extraembryonic membranes. The 
embryo thus develops within the egg 
and outside the mother’s body (there 
are also ovoviviparous reptiles that 
retain the egg within the body until 
hatching).
9. Do beings of the class 
Reptilia have direct or indirect 
development?
In beings of the class Reptilia the 
embryonic development is direct. So 
there is no larval stage.
10. Compared to amphibians 
what are the two reproductive 
novelties of beings of the class 
Reptilia for the survival in dry 
environments?
Compared to amphibians the two main 
reproductive innovations of beings of 
the class Reptilia for the terrestrial 
habitat are internal fecundation and 
shelled eggs.
11. Concerning the 
maintenance of body 
temperature how do beings of 
the class Reptilia classify?
Like fishes and amphibians, beings of 
the class Reptilia are heterothermic 
animals (also known as poikilothermic, 
or ectothermic), i.e., they are not able 
to control by themselves their body 
temperature and thus they depend on 
external warm sources (mainly the 
sun).
12. What is an example of a 
hypothesis which may explain 
why there is not a big 
representation of the class 
Reptilia found in polar 
regions?
Beings of the class Reptilia are 
abundant and more diverse in hot 
climate regions and they are rare in 
intensely cold regions like close to the 
earth poles. This is explained because 
these animals are heterothermic, i.e., 
they have “cold blood” and they need an

The heterothermic feature also explains 
why reptiles are more active during the 
day, a period when they can use the 
sun heat to warm their bodies.

card. How are they 
characterized according to 
examples of representing 
beings, basic morphology, 
skin, respiration, circulation, 
nitrogen waste, thermal 
control and types of 
reproduction?
Examples of representing beings: 
snakes, turtles, crocodiles, lizards, 
dinosaurs (extinct). Basic morphology: 
tetrapods, some with carapaces (like 
turtles). Skin: impermeable keratinized, 
corneous plates (known as scales). 
Respiration: pulmonary. Circulation: 
closed, incomplete, heart with three 
chambers and partial interventricular 
septation. Nitrogen waste: uric acid. 
Thermal control: heterothermic. Types

Biology Questions and Answers
Birds
1. What are the main 
morphological features of 
birds?
Birds are animals that present 
aerodynamic bodies covered with 
feathers, anterior limbs transformed 
into wings, pneumatic bones and horny 
(corneous) beaks.
2. In which habitat do birds 
live?
Birds are terrestrial animals but the 
majority of species also explore the 
aerial environment by flying.
3. What are flight adaptations 
present by birds?
Wings associated to a well-developed 
pectoral musculature, pneumatic bones, 
less accumulation of feces in the bowels 
due to the absence of the colon, 
absence of the bladder (no urine 
storage), aerodynamic body and lungs 
with specialized air sacs are all 
adaptations which enable birds to fly.
4. What are pneumatic bones?
Birds have lightweighted bones with 
internal spaces filled with air. These 
bones are called pneumatic bones. This 
feature reduces the corporal density of 
the animal facilitating the flight.
5. How is the respiratory 
system of birds characterized?
Like reptiles and mammals, they make 
gas exchange through lungs.
6. How is the circulatory 
system of birds characterized?
Birds, like every vertebrate, have a 
closed circulatory system. The heart is 
similar to the mammalian heart, having 
four chambers (two atria and two 
ventricles) and with no mixture of 
venous and arterial blood. (In 
mammals, however, the aorta curves 
down to the left and in birds it curves 
down to the right).
7. Which is the type of 
nitrogen waste birds produce? 
Why does this feature, besides 
being an adaptation to the 
terrestrial environment, also 
mean an adaptation to flight?
Birds are uricotelic, i.e., like reptiles, 
they excrete uric acid. This substance 
needs less water to be eliminated and 
so it helps to reduce the body weight 
thus aiding in flight.

8. What similarities do birds 
and reptiles share regarding 
external coverage, 
reproduction and excretion?
Regarding external coverage, birds are 
similar to reptiles as they present 
impermeable keratinized coverages. 
Concerning reproduction, in both 
fecundation is internal and the embryo 
develops within a shelled egg. 
Regarding excretion, both excrete uric 
acid.
9. How do birds reproduce?
Birds, like every vertebrate, have sexual 
reproduction. Their embryos develop 
within shelled eggs containing 
extraembryonic membranes and outside 
the mother’s body.
Birds copulate. Fecundation is internal 
and it occurs only before the female 
gamete is involved by the calcareous 
eggshell.
10. Is the embryonic 
development in birds direct or 
indirect?
The embryonic development is direct, 
there is no larval stage.

predominating chemical 
compounds respectively in 
eggshell, white and yolk?
The eggshell is basically made of 
calcium carbonate. The white, or 
albumen, is composed by albumin, a 
protein. The yolk is predominantly 
constituted of lipids but it also contains 
proteins and vitamins.
12. How different are reptiles 
and birds concerning the 
maintenance of body 
temperature? Are birds rare in 
polar regions?
Reptiles are heterothermic, i.e., they do 
not control their body temperature. 
Birds however are the first 
homeothermic animals, they are able to 
maintain their body temperature 
constant.
There are many birds that live in intense 
cold regions. Penguins are examples of 
birds that live in polar region.
13. What are zoonoses? What 
are some examples of 
zoonoses transmitted by 
birds?
Zoonoses are human diseases 
transmitted by animals. Psittacosis, a 
bacterial disease, hystoplasmosis and 
cryptococcosis, fungal diseases, are 
examples of zoonoses transmitted by 
birds.

Biology Questions and Answers
Mammals
1. What are the typical 
features of mammals?
The typical features of mammals are: 
body (more or less) covered with hair; 
presence of the diaphragm muscle (that 
separates the thorax from the 
abdomen); mammary glands that 
produce milk (in females); enucleated 
blood red cells; middle ear with three 
ossicles.
2. What are the three main 
groups into which mammals 
are divided?
The three groups into which mammals 
are divided are: monotremes (or 
prototherian, e.g., platypus), marsupials 
(or metatherian, for example, 
kangaroos) and placental (or eutherian, 
such as humans).
3. Do all mammals have a 
placenta?
Mammals of the monotreme group 
(platypus, echidnas) are oviparous, egg-
laying, and they do not have a placenta. 
Mammals of the marsupial group 
(kangaroos, koalas, opossums) do not 
have a placenta either; females of this 
group give birth to embryonic young 
that then continue development within 
the mother’s pouch. Placenta only forms 
in female placental mammals.
4. What are the main orders of 
placental mammals? What are 
some representative species 
and distinguishing features of 
each of those orders?
The orders into which placental 
mammals are divided are the following:
Artiodactyls, mammals with an even 
number of fingers in claws or paws like, 
e.g., cows, sheep, giraffes. Carnivorous, 
predators with canine teeth like dogs, 
lions, tigers. Cetaceans, aquatic animals 
without posterior limbs and similar to 
fishes, like whales and dolphins. 
Edentates, creatures with rare or absent 
teeth, like sloths, armadillos, anteaters. 
Lagomorphs, small-sized mammals 
having three pairs of continuously 
growing incisive teeth specialized in 
gnawing, like rabbits and hares. 
Perissodactyls, also known as ungulates 
(hooved), big-sized animals with an odd 
number of fingers in each paw, e.g., 
horses and rhinos. Primates, 
characterized by the big cranium and 
well-developed brain, like humans and 
apes. Proboscideans, big-sized animals 
whose nose and superior lip form the 
trunk (snout), e.g., elephants. 
Chiropterans, flying nocturnal mammals 
(bats). Rodents, animals with two pairs 
of continuously growing incisive teeth, 
e.g., mice, rats, castors, squirrels. 
Sirenians, aquatic mammals of 
freshwater, deprived of posterior limbs, 
like dugongs and manatees.

Biology Questions and Answers
5. How is gas exchange done 
in mammals?
Mammals breathe through lungs, their 
respiration is pulmonary.
6. How is circulation 
characterized in mammals?
Mammals present a closed and complete 
circulatory system. The heart has four 
chambers and the arterial blood does 
not mix with venous blood.
7. What is the type of nitrogen 
waste that mammals 
eliminate?
Like chondrichtian fishes and adult 
amphibians, mammals are ureotelic, 
i.e., they excrete urea.
8. How do placental mammals 
reproduce?
Placental mammals reproduce sexually, 
they have internal fecundation and they 
are viviparous, i.e., their embryo 
develops within the mother’s body and 
from her it gets the nutrients through 
the placenta.
9. Is fecundation in mammals 
internal or external?
Fecundation in mammals is internal, 
with copulation. In the contemporary 
world human technology is able to 
promote artificial external fecundation 
of human gametes and of gametes of 
other animals.
10. Is the mammalian 
embryonic development direct 
or indirect?
In mammals the embryonic 
development is direct, without larval 
stage.
11. Are there aquatic and 
flying mammals?
Cetaceans (whales, dolphins) and 
sirenians (dugongs, manatees) are 
aquatic mammals. Chiropterans (bats) 
are flying mammals.
12. Are the limbs modified 
into wings of bats and the 
wings of birds examples of 
evolutionary analogy or 
homology? What about whale 
fins compared to fish fins?
Bat and bird wings have the same 
function and the same origin (they are 
modified limbs) so they are analogous 
and homologous organs. Whale fins are 
a modification of the posterior limbs

while fish fins although having the same 
function do not come from modified 
limbs; so they are analogous but not 
homologous structures.
Evolutionary homology suggests 
common ancestry while biological 
analogy relates to the concept of 
evolutionary convergence, the 
appearance of similar features in 
evolutionarily distant species that 
explore the same type of environment 
(in the mentioned case, the aquatic 
habitat).
13. Mammal identity card. 
How are mammals 
characterized according to 
examples of representing 
beings, basic morphology, 
skin, respiration, circulation, 
nitrogen waste, thermal 
control and types of 
reproduction?
Examples of representing beings: dogs, 
cats, horses, giraffes, elephants, apes, 
humans, bats, whales, dolphins, 
opossums, kangaroos, platypus. Basic 
morphology: hair, diaphragm muscle, 
mammary glands, enucleated red blood 
cells. Skin: impermeable, hairy. 
Respiration: pulmonary. Circulation: 
closed and complete, heart with four 
chambers. Nitrogen waste: urea. 
Thermal control: homeothermic. Types 
of reproduction: sexual, internal 
fecundation, oviparous monotremes

Biology Questions and Answers
Basic Histology
1. What is the logical order in 
which the concepts of atoms, 
molecules, cells... up to 
biosphere are associated?
Atoms form molecules that form cells 
that form tissues that form organs that 
form systems. Systems, in their turn, 
constitute individuals that form 
populations that compound (biological) 
communities that form the biotic 
components of ecosystems. All 
ecosystems of earth form the biosphere.
2. From the zygote, 
pluricellular organisms are 
formed by serial mitosis. 
Would this formation be 
possible if each cell made by 
mitosis had an identical life in 
relation to its antecedent 
cells? How did evolution solve 
that problem?
The formation of complex and distinct 
pluricellular organisms would not be 
possible if mitosis in embryos produced 
only daughter cells with an identical life 
history as the mother cell, since there 
would not be differentiation and 
structural or functional specialization 
among cells.
Evolution solved the problem creating 
the cellular differentiation process by 
which, motivated by stimulus not yet 
well-known by science, different and 
specialized cell lineages gave birth to 
different tissues, organs and systems 
that, as a whole, form the pluricellular 
organisms.
Cellular differentiation probably is a 
very intricate process that activates and 
inactivates some genes within the cell in 
response to some stimulus.
3. What are the main types of 
animal tissue?
The main animal cell tissues are the 
epithelial tissue, the nervous tissue, the 
muscle tissue and the connective tissue.
4. What are epithelial tissues? 
What are their general 
function and how is that 
function associated to the 
features of the tissue?
Epithelial tissues, also called epithelia, 
are tissues specialized in the covering of 
external and internal surfaces of the 
body.
The general function of the epithelium is 
to provide protection and 
impermeability (or selective 
permeability) to the covered structure. 
This justifies the epithelium's typical 
features: the cellular juxtaposition 
forming layers of very proximate cells 
with diminished or none intercellular 
space between each two neighbor cells.

Biology Questions and Answers
5. Of which cells is the 
nervous tissue constituted? 
How is the generic function of 
this tissue related to the 
characteristics of the main cell 
type that forms it?
The nervous tissue is formed of neurons 
and glial cells.
The function of the nervous tissue is to 
receive and to transmit neural impulses 
(reception and transmission of 
information). This function justifies the 
characteristic morphology of neurons, 
with membrane projections (dendrites) 
to get information and an elongated 
membrane projection (axon, or nerve 
fiber) to transmit information at 
distance. In their turn, the glial cells 
support the neurons and facilitate their 
work (sometimes acting as insulators).
6. What are muscle tissues? 
How is the function of this 
tissue related to the typical 
characteristics of its cells?
Muscle tissues are tissues made of cells 
able to perform contractions and thus to 
generate movement.
The function of the muscle tissue is to 
pull bones (skeletal striated muscle), to 
contract and move viscera and vessels 
(smooth muscle) and to make the heart 
to beat (cardiac striated muscle). The 
muscle cells have internal structures 
called sarcomeres where there are 
myosin and actin molecules disposed to 
create contraction and distension 
(movement).
7. What is the typical 
biological function of the 
connective tissues? How is 
this function associated to the 
main features of its cells?
The typical function of the connective 
tissues is to fill empty spaces among 
other body tissues.
This function is related to the great 
capability of the cells of the connective 
tissue to secrete substances that 
constitute extracellular material, like 
collagen and elastic fibers, creating a 
significant spacing between these cells.
(There are other important biological 
features of the connective tissues, such 
as substance transportation, defense of 
the organism, etc.)
8. Of which type of tissue are 
cartilages and bones made?
Bones and cartilages, tissues with great 
amount of intercellular material, are 
formed of connective tissue.
9. Are the cells of the 
connective tissue far or near 
to the others?
The relative great spacing between cells 
is a typical feature of the connective 
tissue. There are much intercellular 
material generally secreted by the 
tissue cells.

Biology Questions and Answers
10. What are the general 
functions of the connective 
tissues?
The main functions of the connective 
tissues are: supporting and filling of 
spaces; cellular nutrition; energetic 
storage (fats); hematopoiesis 
(formation of blood, blood cells and 
blood components); immune defense 
(specialized cells).
11. What is connective tissue 
proper?
The name connective tissue proper is 
used to designate the connective tissue 
that fills interstitial spaces as opposed 
to the specialized connective tissues 
(blood, bones, cartilage, adipose tissue, 
etc.). The connective tissue proper 
secretes collagen, elastin and reticular 
fibers.
12. What are the main cells of 
the connective tissue proper? 
What is the name given to the 
intercellular material that 
surround these cells?
The main cells of the connective tissue 
proper are the fibroblasts, cells that 
secrete the intercellular material. These 
cells are the majority of cells of the 
tissue. Fibroblasts later are transformed 
into fibrocytes, mature cells with 
restricted secretory role.
The intercellular substance that fills the 
interstice is called interstitial matrix, or 
just matrix.
13. What are the three types 
of protein fibers of the 
connective tissue proper?
The matrix of the connective tissue 
proper is made of collagen fibers, elastic 
fibers and reticular fibers.
14. What is the function of the 
collagen fibers of the 
connective tissue?
There are different collagen types. The 
main function of these proteins is to 
keep the shape and the structural 
rigidity of the tissue. (Collagen is the 
most abundant protein of the human 
body.)
15. Of which substance do 
elastic fibers of the connective 
tissue are made? What are 
some functions of these 
fibers?
The elastic fibers are made of a protein 
called elastin.
Elastic fibers abound in artery walls, 
helping the maintenance of the arterial 
blood pressure in these vessels. They 
are also present in the lungs, providing 
them with elasticity (some respiratory 
diseases are caused by destruction of 
these fibers). In many other organs and 
tissues the elastic fibers are found in the 
interstitial matrix.

Biology Questions and Answers
16. What are the reticular 
fibers of the connective tissue 
and where can they be found?
The reticular fibers are very delicate 
interstitial fibers made of a special type 
of collagen known as collagen type III. 
They can be found in many organs and 
tissues such as in lymphnodes, in the 
spleen, in the liver, in blood vessels and 
also covering muscle fibers.
17. What are diseases of the 
connective tissue? What are 
some of them?
Diseases of the connective tissue are 
hereditary or acquired diseases(many of 
autoimmune cause) characterized by 
deficiency in structure or function of 
components of the connective tissue, for 
example, deficiencies of collagen, 
elastin, etc. Some of such diseases are 
lupus, dermatomyositis, cheloid, 
scleroderma, mixed connective tissue 
disease, mucinosis and Marfan's 
syndrome.

Biology Questions and Answers
Blood
1. What are the main 
functions of the blood?
The blood is a means of substance 
transportation throughout the body. The 
blood distributes nutrients, oxygen, 
hormones, antibodies and cells 
specialized in defense to the tissues and 
collects residuals like nitrogen wastes 
and carbon dioxide from them.
2. What are the constituent 
elements of the blood?
The blood is made of a liquid and a 
cellular part. The fluid part is called 
plasma and in it there are several 
substances, like proteins, lipids, 
carbohydrates and mineral salts. The 
cellular constituents of the blood are 
also known as blood corpuscles and 
they comprise the erythrocytes (red 
blood cells), leukocytes and platelets.
3. What is hematopoiesis?
Hematopoiesis is the formation of blood 
cells and other constituent elements of 
the blood.
4. Where does hematopoiesis 
occur?
Hematopoiesis occurs in the bone 
marrow (mainly within flat bones), 
where erythrocytes, leukocytes and 
platelets are made, and in the lymphoid 
tissue, responsible for the maturation of 
leukocytes and found in the thymus, 
spleen and lymphnodes.
5. In which bones can bone 
marrow chiefly be found? Is 
the bone marrow made of 
osseous tissue?
Bone marrow can mainly be found in the 
internal cavities of flat bones, like the 
vertebrae, the ribs, the scapulae, the 
sternum and the hips.
The bone marrow is not made of 
osseous tissue, although it is a 
connective tissue as bone tissue is.
6. What are blood stem cells?
Stem cells are undifferentiated cells able 
to differentiate into other types of 
specialized cells.
The stem cells of the bone marrow 
originate the differentiated blood cells. 
According to stimulus from specific 
growth factors the stem cells are turned 
into red blood cells, leukocytes and 
megakaryocytes (cells that form 
platelets). Research shows that stem 
cells of the bone marrow can also 
differentiate into muscle, nervous and 
hepatic cells.

7. What are the other names 
by which erythrocytes are 
known? What is the function 
of these cells?
Erythrocytes are also known as red 
blood cells (RBCs), or red corpuscles. 
Red blood cells are responsible for 
oxygen transport from the lungs to the 
tissues.
8. What is the name of the 
molecule that transports 
oxygen in red blood cells?
The respiratory pigment of the red blood 
cells is hemoglobin.
9. What is the molecular 
composition of hemoglobin? 
Does the functionality of 
hemoglobin as a protein 
depend upon its tertiary or 
upon its quaternary structure?
Hemoglobin is a molecule made of four 
polypeptide chains, each bound to a 
iron-containing molecular group called a 
heme group. So the molecule contains 
four polypeptide chains and four heme 
groups.
As a protein composed of association of 
polypeptide chains, the functionality of 
hemoglobin depends upon the integrity 
of its quaternary structure.
10. On average what is the life 
duration of the red blood 
cells? Where are they 
destroyed? What is the 
destination of the heme 
groups after the destruction of 
hemoglobin molecules?
On average red blood cells live around 
120 days. The spleen is the main organ 
where old red blood cells are destroyed.
During the red blood cell destruction the 
heme groups turn into bilirubin and this 
substance is then captured by the liver 
and later excreted in the bowels as part 
of the bile.
11. What are the functions of 
the spleen? Why is a total 
splenectomy (surgical removal 
of the spleen) compatible with 
life?
The spleen has many functions: it 
participates in the destruction of old red 
blood cells; in it specialized leukocytes 
are matured; it helps the renewal of the 
hematopoietic tissue of the bone 
marrow when necessary; it can act as a 
spongelike organ to retain or liberate 
blood from or for the circulation.
Total splenectomy is not incompatible 
with life as none of the functions of the 
spleen are vital and at the same time 
exclusive of this organ.

Biology Questions and Answers
12. What is anemia? What are 
the four main types of 
anemia?
Anemia is low concentration of 
hemoglobin in the blood.
The four main types of anemia are the 
nutrient-deficiency anemia, anemia 
caused by blood loss, hemolytic anemia 
and aplastic anemia.
Nutrient-deficiency anemia is caused by 
dietary deficiency of fundamental 
nutrients for the production or 
functioning of the red blood cells, like 
iron (iron deficiency anemia), vitamin 
B12 and folic acid.
Anemia caused by blood loss occurs in 
hemorrhagic conditions or in diseases 
like peptic ulcerations and hookworm 
disease.
Hemolytic anemia is caused by 
excessive destruction of red blood cells, 
for example, in diseases like malaria or 
in hypervolemic conditions (excessive 
water in blood that causes lysis of red 
blood cells).
Aplastic anemia occurs from deficiencies 
of the hematopoiesis and it happens 
when the bone marrow is injured by 
cancers from other tissues (metastasis), 
by autoimmune diseases and by 
intoxication from drugs (like sulfas and 
anticonvulsants) or by chemical 
substances (like benzene, insecticides, 
paints, herbicides and solvents in 
general). Some genetic diseases also 
affect the bone marrow causing aplastic 
anemia.
13. What is the difference 
between white and red blood 
cells? What are leukocytes?
Red blood cells are erythrocytes and 
white blood cells are the leukocytes.
Leukocytes are cells specialized in the 
defense of the body against strange 
agents and they are part of the immune 
system.
14. What are the types of 
leukocytes and how are they 
classified into granulocytes 
and agranulocytes?
The types of leukocytes are 
lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, 
eosinophils and basophils. Granulocytes 
are those in whose cytoplasm there are 
granules (when viewed under electronic 
microscopy): neutrophils, eosinophils 
and basophils are granulocytes. 
Agranulocytes are the other leukocytes: 
lymphocytes and monocytes.
15. What is the generic 
function of leukocytes? What 
are leukocytosis and 
leukopenia?
The generic function of leukocytes is to 
participate in the defense of the body 
against strange agents that penetrate it 
or are made inside the body.
Leukocytosis and leukopenia are clinical 
conditions in which the count of 
leukocytes in a blood sample is 
abnormal. When the leukocyte count in

Biology Questions and Answers
a blood sample is above the normal 
level for the individual leukocytosis is 
defined. When the leukocyte count is 
lower than the expected normal level 
leukopenia is defined. The multiplication 
of these defense cells, leukocytosis, 
generally takes place when the body is 
suffering infections or in cancers of 
these cells. The lowering of these 
defense cells, or leukopenia, occurs 
when some diseases attack the cells, 
like in AIDS, or when 
immunosuppressor drugs are used.
In general the body creates leukocytosis 
as a defense reaction when it is facing 
infectious or pathogenic agents. The 
clinical condition of leukocytosis is thus 
a sign of infection. Leukopenia occurs 
when there is a deficiency in the 
production (for example, in bone 
marrow diseases) or excessive 
destruction of leukocytes (for example, 
in case of HIV infection).
16. What are the mechanisms 
of hemorrhage contention 
called?
The physiological mechanisms of 
hemorrhage contention (one of them is 
blood clotting) are generically named 
hemostasis, or hemostatic processes.
17. How are platelets formed? 
What is the function of 
platelets? What consequences 
does the clinical condition 
known as thrombocytopenia 
yield?
Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, 
are fragments of giant cells of the bone 
marrow called megakaryocytes. With 
their properties of aggregation and 
adhesiveness they play a direct role in 
blood clotting and they also liberate 
substances that activate other 
hemostatic processes.
Thrombocytopenia is a clinical condition 
in which the platelet count of the blood 
is lower than normal. In this situation 
the person becomes susceptible to 
hemorrhages.
18. How does the organism 
understand that a clotting 
process must begin?
When there is some tissue wound with 
injury of blood vessel the platelets and 
endothelial cells of the wall of the 
damaged vessel liberate substances 
(respectively platelet factors and tissue 
factors) that trigger the clotting 
process.
19. How can the blood 
coagulation (clotting) process 
be described?
Blood clotting encompasses a sequence 
of chemical reactions whose respective 
products are enzymes that catalyze the 
following reactions (that is why the 
clotting reactions are called cascade 
reactions). In the plasma 
thromboplastinogen transforms into 
thromboplastin, a reaction triggered by 
tissue and platelet factors liberated after 
injury of the blood vessel. 
Thromboplastin then catalyzes along

Biology Questions and Answers
with calcium ions the transformation of 
prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin 
then catalyzes a reaction that produces 
fibrin from fibrinogen. Fibrin, as an 
insoluble substance, precipitates to form 
a network that traps red blood cells and 
platelets forming the blood clot and 
containing the hemorrhage.
20. What are clotting factors?
Clotting factors are substances 
(enzymes, coenzymes, reagents) 
necessary for the clotting stages to 
happen. Besides those triggering factors 
and reagents already described (tissue 
and platelet factors, thromplastinogen, 
prothrombin, fibrinogen, calcium ions), 
other substances participate in the 
blood clotting process as clotting 
factors, like factor VIII, whose 
deficiency causes hemophilia A, or the 
factor IX, whose deficiency causes 
hemophilia B.
21. What is the organ where 
most of the clotting factors 
are produced? What is the role 
of vitamin K in the blood 
coagulation?
Most of the clotting factors are produced 
in the liver.
Vitamin K participates in the activation 
of several clotting factors and it is 
fundamental for the well-functioning of 
the blood coagulation.
22. What is factor VIII? What 
is the genetic disease in which 
this factor is absent?
Factor VIII has the function of activating 
factor X that in its turn is necessary for 
the transformation of prothrombin into 
thrombin in the clotting cascade. 
Hemophilia A is the X-linked genetic 
disease in which the individual does not 
produce factor VIII and so is more 
susceptible to severe hemorrhages.
23. How is hemophilia 
treated? Why is hemophilia 
rare in females?
Hemophilia is medically treated with 
administration of factor VIII, in case of 
hemophilia A, or of factor IX, in case of 
hemophilia B, by means of blood or 
fresh frozen plasma transfusions.
Hemophilia, A or B, is an X-linked 
recessive inheritance and for a girl to be 
hemophilic it is necessary for both of 
her X chromosomes to be affected while 
boys, that have only one X 
chromosome, are more easily affected. 
A girl with only one affected 
chromosome does not present the 
disease since the normal gene of the 
unaffected other X chromosome 
produces the clotting factor.

Since hemophilic patients need frequent 
transfusions of clotting factors (VIII or 
IX) they are more susceptible to 
contamination by infectious agents 
present in the blood from which the 
transfused elements come. In the past 
the blood banks did not usually perform 
HIV detection tests and many 
hemophilic patients have become 
infected with the virus.

Anticoagulants are substances that 
block the clotting reactions and thus 
stop the coagulation process. Ordinarily 
there are anticoagulants circulating in 
the plasma since under normal 
conditions the blood must be kept fluid.
In Medicine anticoagulants like heparin 
are used in surgeries in which tissue 
injuries made by the surgical act could 
trigger undesirable systemic blood 
clotting. They are also used to avoid the 
formation of thrombus inside blood 
vessels of patients facing increased 
thrombotic risk.
26. What is dicoumarol? How 
does this substance act in the 
clotting process and what are 
some examples of its toxicity?
Dicoumarol is an anticoagulant drug. 
Due to its molecular structure 
dicoumarol competes with vitamin K for 
the binding to substrates blocking the 
formation of clotting factors and 
interrupting the making of prothrombin. 
Dicoumarol is found in some vegetables 
undergoing decomposition, and it can 
cause severe internal hemorrhages 
when those vegetables are accidentally 
ingested. Coumarinic anticoagulants 
cannot be administered during 
pregnancy since they pass the placental 
barrier and can cause fetal 
hemorrhages.
27. Streptokinase is a 
substance used in the 
treatment of acute myocardial 
infarction. How does this 
substance act?
Substances known as fibrinolytics, like 
streptokinase and urokinase, can 
destroy thrombi (clots formed inside 
blood vessels, capillaries or within the 
heart chambers) and are used in the 
treatment of obstructions of the 
coronary arteries or other blood vessels.
Streptokinase destroys the fibrin 
network and so it dissolves the 
thrombotic clot. Its name comes after 
the bacteria that produce it, the 
streptococci.

Biology Questions and Answers
Metabolism and 
Homeostasis
1. What is metabolism?
Metabolism is the set of physical and 
chemical processes upon which the life 
of the cells of a living being depends.
2. What is the difference 
between anabolism and 
catabolism?
Metabolism comprises two opposing 
processes: anabolism and catabolism. 
Anabolism is a set of synthesis reactions 
that transform simpler compounds into 
organic molecules in general with 
energy spending. Catabolism is a set of 
reactions that break organic molecules 
into simpler and less complex 
substances in general with liberation of 
energy. The energy liberated in 
catabolism may be used in vital 
processes of the organism, including 
anabolism.
3. What is homeostasis? What 
are the sensors, controllers 
and effectors of homeostasis?
Homeostasis comprises the processes 
by which the organism maintains 
adequate intra and extracellular 
conditions to keep possible the normal 
reactions of the metabolism.
Homeostatic sensors are structures that 
detect information from the inner and 
outer environment of the body. These 
sensors may be nervous receptor cells, 
cytoplasmic or membrane proteins and 
other specialized molecules. Controllers 
are structures responsible for processing 
and interpreting information received 
from the sensors. Controllers in general 
are specialized regions of the central 
nervous system but on the molecular 
level there are also some of them, like 
DNA, a molecule that can get 
information from proteins to inhibit or 
stimulate the expression of some genes. 
Effectors are elements commanded by 
the controllers that have the function of 
bringing about actions that in fact 
regulate and maintain the equilibrium of 
the organism, like muscles, glands, 
cellular organelles, etc., and in the 
molecular level structures that 
participate in the genetic translation, 
the produced proteins, etc.
4. How do antagonistic 
mechanisms manage 
homeostatic regulation?
The homeostatic maintenance of the 
body mostly occurs by means of 
alternating antagonistic compensatory 
mechanisms. There are regulators that 
lower the pH and others that increase it, 
there are effectors whose function is to 
increase the body temperature and 
others that lower it, hormones exist 
that, e.g., reduce the level of glucose in 
the blood and others that increase the 
glycemic level. The use of antagonistic 
mechanisms is a strategy found by 
evolution to solve the problem of the 
maintenance of the body equilibrium.

Biology Questions and Answers
5. What is an example of 
negative feeback of the 
homeostatic regulation?
Negative feedback happens when the 
response to a given action generates an 
effect that inhibits that action. For 
example, when the carbon dioxide 
concentration in blood is high the 
pulmonary respiration is stimulated for 
the CO2 excess to be expelled through 
expiration. Hyperventilation, however, 
lowers the carbon dioxide concentration 
in blood too much generating a negative 
feedback that commands the reduction 
of the respiratory frequency.
Negative feedback is the main 
mechanism of homeostasis and it occurs 
in a variety of processes, such as in 
blood pressure control, glycemic control, 
muscle contraction, etc.
6. What is an example of 
positive feedback of the 
homeostatic regulation?
In positive feedback the effect caused 
by an action stimulates the action even 
more. This is a rarer mechanism of the 
homeostatic regulation.
An example of positive feedback is the 
blood clotting process in which each 
chemical reaction produces enzymes 
that catalyze the following reaction until 
the formation of fibrin. Therefore the 
products of the antecedent chemical 
reactions are consumed and the 
equilibrium of each reaction is 
dislocated towards the production of 
more enzymes (a positive feedback).

Biology Questions and Answers
Nutrition and 
Vitamins
1. What is a nutrient?
A nutrient is every substance used in 
the metabolism and which is acquired 
from the diet. For example, vitamins 
and essential amino acids are nutrients.
2. What is the difference 
between macro and 
micronutrients?
The classification criterion of nutrients 
into macro and micronutrients has no 
relation to the size of the molecule. 
Macronutrients are those needed in 
great amount, for example, proteins 
and carbohydrates. Micronutrients are 
those needed in small quantities, like 
vitamins.
3. According to their functions 
how can nutrients be 
classified?
One possible and utile functional 
classification for nutrients is the one 
that separates them into energetic, 
structural and regulatory.
Energetic nutrients are those used as 
energy source for the metabolism; 
mainly they are the carbohydrates (but 
fats and proteins can also be converted 
into acetyl-CoA and “cycle” the Krebs 
cycle). Structural nutrients are those 
used in the support and structure of 
cells and tissues; they are the amino 
acids that form structural proteins, like 
collagen, the membrane proteins, the 
cytoskeleton proteins, the contractile 
proteins of the muscle tissue, etc. 
Regulatory nutrients are those that 
constitute enzymes and coenzymes of 
the homeostasis, metabolites of the 
osmotic and electrolytic equilibrium of 
cells and hormones; some amino acids, 
vitamins and mineral salts are part of 
this group.
4. What are vitamins? What 
are the main vitamins needed 
by humans?
Most vitamins are coenzymes 
(fundamental substances for the 
enzyme functioning) that are not 
produced by the organism and must be 
obtained from the diet.
The main vitamins needed by humans 
are vitamins A, C, D, E, K, the vitamins 
of the B complex (including folic acid), 
biotin and pantothenic acid.
5. What is the difference 
between water-soluble and 
fat-soluble vitamins? Why can 
fat-soluble vitamins cause 
harm when ingested in 
excess?
Water-soluble vitamins are those 
soluble in water. Fat-soluble vitamins 
are those soluble in oil (lipids, fat). 
www.biology-questions-and-answers.com

Transaction ID: 4KS71350WY6468607

Biology Questions and Answers
Vitamin C and the vitamins of the B 
complex are examples of water-soluble 
vitamins. Vitamins A, D, E and K are 
examples of fat-soluble vitamins.
Fat-soluble vitamins, since they are not 
soluble in water, cannot easily be 
excreted by the body. So they tend to 
accumulate in tissues with toxic effect 
when they are ingested in amounts over 
what is necessary.
6. What are the main harms 
caused by vitamin A 
deficiency? How does this 
vitamin act in the physiology 
of vision?
Deficiency of vitamin A (retinol) may 
cause night blindness, corneal dryness 
(xerophthalmia) and predisposition to 
skin injuries.
In the physiology of vision, vitamin A 
participates in the formation of 
rhodopsin, a pigment responsible for the 
visual perception in less illuminated 
places.
Nutrition Vitamins - Image Diversity: 
vitamin A deficiency
7. What is folic acid? Why is 
the anemia caused by 
deficiency of folic acid known 
as megaloblastic anemia?
The folic acid (when ionized it is called 
folate) is a coenzyme that participates 
in the synthesis and duplication of DNA 
and for this reason it is fundamental for 
cell division. If there are not enough 
folic acid in cells with great turnover, 
like red blood cells, they have their 
production reduced.
In folic acid deficiency precursor cells 
(reticulocytes) that would originate 
erythrocytes (red blood cells) begin cell 
division but the process is very slow 
while the cytoplasm growth is normal. 
So the cells became abnormally large, a 
typical feature of this kind of anemia 
called megaloblastic anemia.
Megaloblastic anemia can be caused 
also by vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) 
deficiency since this vitamin is 
important for cell division too. Both 
types of anemia are nutrient deficiency 
anemias.
Nutrition Vitamins - Image Diversity: 
megaloblastic red blood cell
8. What are the vitamins 
which make up the B 
complex? Which problems 
does the lack of these 
vitamins cause?
Vitamins of the B complex are: thiamin, 
or vitamin B1; riboflavin, or vitamin B2, 
and niacin (B3), essential for the 
constitution of the hydrogen acceptors 
FAD, NAD and NADP of the energetic 
metabolism; pyridoxine, or B6; and 
cyanocobalamin, or vitamin B12.
Deficiency of vitamin B1 causes beriberi, 
loss of appetite and fatigue. The lack of 
vitamin B2 causes mucosal injuries in 
the mouth, tongue and lips. Deficiency 
of niacin causes nervousness, digestive 
disturbances, loss of energy and

pellagra. Lack of vitamin B6 causes skin 
lesions, irritation and convulsions. 
Vitamin B12 acts together with folic acid 
and its deficiency causes cell division 
disruptions leading to pernicious anemia 
(a type of megaloblastic and nutrient 
deficiency anemia).
The absorption of vitamin B12 depends 
on another substance called the intrinsic 
factor secreted by the gastric mucosa.
9. How does vitamin C act in 
the body? What is the harm 
caused by insufficiency of 
vitamin C? Why was this 
deficiency also known as 
“sailors' disease”?
Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, participates 
in the metabolism of collagen and it is 
fundamental for the integrity of blood 
capillaries.
Scurvy is the disease caused by a lack 
of vitamin C. It is characterized by 
tissue lesions in the skin, lips, nose and 
joints. Scurvy, or scorbutus, was also 
known as sailors' disease because in 
maritime voyages of the past it was not 
common to get on board food that 
contained vitamin C, like citric fruits. So 
the sailors became ill with scurvy.
10. Why isn't the cooking of 
vitamin C-containing foods 
appropriate for vitamin C 
supply?
To obtain vitamin C, for example, from 
an orange dessert, the vitamin-
containing food cannot be submitted to 
high temperatures (cooking) since 
vitamin C is thermolabile, i.e., it is 
inactivated by heat.
11. What is the association 
between vitamin D and 
sunrays?
Vitamin D, or calciferol, is synthesized 
in the skin by the action of the 
ultraviolet range of sunrays upon 
precursor molecules. Later it is 
transformed into its active form in the 
liver and the kidneys.
12. What is the disease 
caused by vitamin D 
deficiency? Which tissue does 
it affect?
The lack of vitamin D causes the disease 
known as rickets (rachitis), 
characterized by decalcification of bones 
and bone deformities. Vitamin D is 
fundamental for absorption of calcium 
and thus it is related to the osseous 
tissue health.
13. What is the function of 
vitamin E? In which foods can 
it be found?
Vitamin E, or tocopherol, is a fat-soluble 
vitamin that participates as coenzyme in 
the respiratory chain, the final stage of 
the aerobic cellular respiration. Its 
deficiency may cause sterility,

spontaneous abortions and muscle 
dystrophy.
Vitamin E is mainly found in corn oil and 
peanut oil, wheat germ, milk, eggs and 
leafy vegetables.
14. Why are some types of 
hemorrhagic diseases caused 
by genetic or acquired 
deficiency of the vitamin K 
metabolism?
Deficiency of vitamin K predisposes to 
hemorrhages since this vitamin is 
fundamental for the formation of 
prothrombin in the blood clotting 
process.
15. What are the functions of 
biotin and pantothenic acid for 
the body? How are these 
vitamins obtained?
Biotin (also know as vitamin B8) is a 
vitamin that acts in the metabolism of 
amino acids and other acids. 
Pantothenic acid (also known as vitamin 
B5) is important for the aerobic cellular 
respiration since it acts in the transport 
of acetyl and acyl radicals.
Biotin is made by bacteria that live in 
the human digestive tube (under 
interspecific harmonious ecological 
interaction) and this supply in general is 
enough for the body. Biotin and 
pantothenic acid are found in 
vegetables, cereals, eggs, fish, milk and 
lean meat.
16. What are the main mineral 
salts responsible for the 
cellular osmotic regulation?
The main ions that act in the regulation 
of the osmotic pressure in cells and 
tissues are the chlorine anion, the 
sodium cation and the potassium cation.
17. What are the main cellular 
functions of potassium?
Besides being important for the osmotic 
regulation and for the acid-base 
equilibrium (pH) potassium is 
fundamental for the excitatory 
mechanisms of nerves and in muscle 
contraction.
18. What are some examples 
of mineral salts from the diet 
that act as coenzymes?
Magnesium, zinc and copper are 
examples of biological coenzymes.
19. What is the disease 
caused by dietary iodine 
deficiency?
Iodine deficiency causes 
hypothyroidism, an abnormally lower 
production of thyroid hormones that 
need iodine to be synthesized.

iron in diet? What is the 
disease caused by iron 
deficiency?
Iron acts as a constituent of the 
hemoglobin molecule and of enzymes of 
the digestion and energetic metabolism. 
Dietary iron deficiency causes iron 
deficiency anemia, abnormal lowering of 
hemoglobin concentration in blood due 
to lack of iron. (In pregnancy there is a 
high consumption of iron by the fetus 
and this fact can lead to anemia.)

Biology Questions and Answers
Digestive System
1. What is digestion?
Digestion is the breaking down of larger 
organic molecules obtained from the 
diet, e.g. carbohydrates, fats, proteins, 
into smaller ones, like glucose, fatty 
acids, glycerol and amino acids.
2. How different are 
intracellular and extracellular 
digestion? What is the 
evolutionary advantage of 
extracellular digestion?
Intracellular digestion is that in which 
the breaking down of macromolecules 
takes place within the cell. Extracellular 
digestion is that in which 
macromolecules are broken down in 
places outside the cell (in the 
extracellular space, in the surrounds, in 
the lumen of digestive tubes, etc.)
The advent of extracellular digestion in 
evolution allowed organisms to benefit 
from a greater variety of food. The 
breaking down of larger molecules into 
smaller ones outside the cell permitted 
the use of other foods than those that, 
due the size of their molecules, could 
not be interiorized by diffusion, 
phagocytosis or pinocytosis.
3. How is extracellular 
digestion related to cellular 
and tissue specialization?
A variety of specialized cells and tissues 
appeared with extracellular digestion to 
provide enzymes and special structures 
for the breaking down of dietary 
macromolecules.
This phenomenon allowed other cells to 
be liberated for other tasks and 
differentiations while benefiting from 
nutrients distributed through the 
circulation.
4. What is the difference 
between a complete digestive 
system and an incomplete 
digestive system? How are 
these types of digestive tubes 
associated or not to 
extracellular digestion?
Animals with an incomplete digestive 
system are those in which the digestive 
tube has only one opening (cnidarians, 
platyhelminthes). Animals with a 
complete digestive system are those in 
which the digestive tube has two 
openings, mouth and anus (all other 
animal phyla, with the exception of 
poriferans, that do not have any 
digestive tube).
In animals with incomplete digestive 
tubes the digestion is mixed, it begins in 
the extracellular space and finishes in 
the intracellular space. In animals with 
complete digestive systems extracellular 
digestion within the digestive tube 
predominates.

Biology Questions and Answers
5. What are some evolutionary 
advantages of animals with 
complete digestive tube?
The complete digestive tube allows 
animals to continuously feed themselves 
without waiting for residuals to be 
eliminated before beginning the 
digestion of new foods. In this way the 
absorption of larger amount of nutrients 
is possible and therefore bigger and 
more complex species can develop. 
Digestive tubes with two openings also 
make digestion more efficient since they 
provide different sites with different 
physical and chemical conditions 
(mouth, stomach, bowels) for the action 
of different complementary digestive 
enzymatic systems.
6. What is mechanical 
digestion? In molluscs, 
arthropods, earthworms, birds 
and vertebrates, in general, 
which organs respectively 
participate in this type of 
digestion?
Mechanical digestion is the 
fragmentation of food aided by 
specialized physical structures, such as 
teeth, previous to extracellullar 
digestion. The mechanical 
fragmentation of food helps digestive 
enzymatic reactions because it provides 
a larger total area for the contact 
between enzymes and their substrates.
In some molluscs, the mechanical 
fragmentation is done by the radula (a 
teeth-like structure). Some arthropods, 
like lobsters and dragonflies, have 
mouthparts that make mechanical 
digestion of food. In earthworms and 
birds, the mechanical digestion is made 
by an internal muscular organ. In 
mandibulate vertebrates there are 
mandibles and chewing muscles to 
triturate food previous to the chemical 
digestion.
7. Concerning extracellular 
digestion what is meant by 
chemical digestion?
Chemical digestion is the series of 
enzymatic reactions to break 
macromolecules into smaller ones.
8. Which type of chemical 
reaction is the breaking of 
macromolecules into smaller 
ones that occurs in digestion? 
What are the enzymes that 
participate in this process 
called?
The reactions of the extracellular 
digestion are hydrolysis reactions, i.e., 
breaking of molecules with the help of 
water. The enzymes that participate in 
digestion are hydrolytic enzymes.
9. Which organs of the body 
are part of the human 
digestive system?
The digestive system, also known as 
“systema digestorium”, or 
gastrointestinal system, is composed of 
the digestive tube organs plus the

digestive adnexal glands. The digestive 
tube is composed of mouth, pharynx, 
esophagus, stomach, small intestine 
(duodenum, jejunum, ileum), large 
intestine (caecum, colon, rectum) and 
anus.
10. What are peristaltic 
movements? What is their role 
in human digestion?
Peristalsis is the process of 
synchronized contractions of the 
muscular wall of the digestive tube. 
Peristaltic movements may occur from 
the esophagus until and including the 
bowels.
The peristaltic movements are 
involuntary and they have the function 
of moving and mixing food along the 
digestive tube. Peristaltic movement 
deficiency, for example, in case of 
injuries of the innervation of the 
muscular wall of the digestive tube 
caused by Chagas’ disease, can lead to 
the interruption of the food traffic inside 
the bowels and to severe clinical 
consequences like megacolon (abnormal 
enlargement of the colon) and 
megaesophagus (enlargement of the 
esophagus).
11. From the lumen to the 
external surface what are the 
tissues that form the digestive 
tube wall?
From the internal surface to the external 
surface, the digestive tube wall is made 
of mucosa (epithelial tissue responsible 
for the intestinal absorption), 
submucosa (connective tissue beneath 
the mucous membrane and where blood 
and lymphatic vessels and neural fibers 
are located), muscle layers (smooth 
muscle tissue, two layers, one interior 
circular and other exterior longitudinal, 
structures responsible for the peristaltic 
movement), serous membrane 
(associated epithelial and connective 
tissue forming the external surface of 
the organ). In the bowels the serous 
membrane prolongs to form the 
mesentery, a serosa that encloses blood 
vessels and supports the bowels within 
the abdominal cavity.
12. What is the location of the 
salivary glands in humans?
There are 6 major salivary glands and 
they are located one in each parotid 
gland, two beneath the mandibles 
(submandibular) and two in the base of 
the tongue (sublingual). More than 700 
other minor salivary glands exist 
dispersed on the lip mucosa, gingiva, 
palate and pharynx.
13. What is the approximate 
pH of the salivary secretion? 
Is it an acid or basic fluid? 
What are the main functions 
of saliva?
The saliva pH is approximately 6.8. It is 
thus a slightly acid pH.
Saliva lubricates the food bolus and 
initiates the enzymatic extracellular 
digestion of food. It also works as a

buffer for the mouth pH and it has an 
important role of having IgA antibodies 
(also present in tears, colostrum, 
mother’s milk and in the mucosae of the 
intestine and airways) that protect the 
organism against pathogens.
14. What is the salivary 
digestive enzyme? Which type 
of food does it digest and into 
which smaller molecules does 
it transform the food?
The salivary hydrolase is known as 
salivary amylase, or ptyalin. Ptyalin 
digests carbohydrates breaking starch 
and glycogen, glucose polymers, into 
maltose (a glucose disaccharide) and 
dextrin.
15. Why doesn't the food 
enter the trachea instead of 
going to the esophagus?
When food is swallowed the swallow 
reflex is activated and the larynx 
elevates and closes to avoid portions of 
the food bolus entering the trachea 
causing aspiration of strange material to 
the bronchi.
16. Is the esophagus a 
muscular organ? Why even in 
a patient lying totally flat on a 
hospital bed can the 
swallowed food reach the 
stomach?
The esophagus is a predominantly 
muscular organ so the assertion is 
correct. The esophagus is a muscular 
tube formed in its superior third of 
striated muscle tissue, in its middle 
third of mixed muscle tissue (striated 
and smooth) and in its lower third of 
smooth muscle tissue. The peristalsis of 
the esophagus provides the movement 
of the food towards the stomach even 
without gravitational help.
17. What is the route of the 
ingested food from swallowing 
until the duodenum?
Until reaching the duodenum the food 
enters the mouth, passes the pharynx, 
goes down the esophagus and passes 
the stomach.
18. what is the valve that 
separates the stomach from 
the esophagus called? What is 
its function?
The valve that separates the stomach 
from the esophagus is the cardia. It has 
the function of preventing acid gastric 
content from entering back into the 
esophagus. Insufficiency of this valve 
causes gastroesophageal reflux, a 
disease in which patients complain of 
bloating and heartburn (retrosternal 
burning).

19. What is the valve that 
separates the duodenum from 
the stomach called? What is 
its function?
The valve that separates the stomach 
from the duodenum is the pylorus. It 
has the function of keeping the food 
bolus within the gastric cavity for 
enough time to allow the gastric 
digestion to take place. It also has the 
function of preventing the intestinal 
content from going back into the 
stomach.
20. What is the pH inside the 
stomach? Why is there a need 
to keep that pH level? How is 
it maintained? Which are the 
cells that produce that pH?
The normal pH of the gastric juice is 
around 2. So it is an acid pH.
It is necessary for the gastric pH to be 
kept acid for the activation of 
pepsinogen (a proenzyme secreted by 
the gastric chief cells) into pepsin, the 
digestive enzyme that acts only under 
low pH. This pH level is attained by the 
secretion of hydrochloric acid (HCl) by 
the parietal cells.
21. Besides being fundamental 
for the activation of the main 
gastric digestive enzyme how 
does HCl also directly 
participate in digestion?
With its corrosive effect, HCl also helps 
the rupture of the adhesion between 
food particles, facilitating the digestive 
process.
22. How is the gastric mucosa 
protected from the acid pH of 
the stomach?
The gastric epithelium is mucus 
secretory, i.e., it produces mucus. The 
mucus covers the stomach wall 
preventing corrosion by the gastric 
juice.
23. What is the digestive 
enzyme that acts within the 
stomach? Which type of food 
does it digest? What are the 
cells that produce that 
enzyme?
The digestive enzyme that acts in the 
stomach is pepsin. Pepsin has the 
function of breaking proteins into 
smaller peptides. The gastric cells that 
produce pepsinogen (the zymogen 
precursor of pepsin) are the chief cells.
24. What name does the food 
bolus that passes from the 
stomach to the duodenum 
get?
The partially digested and semifluid food 
bolus that leaves the stomach and 
enters the duodenum is called chyme.

of the small intestine?
The small intestine is divided into three

ileum.
26. By generally dividing food 
into carbohydrates, fats and 
proteins and considering the 
digestive process until the 
pylorus (exit of stomach), 
which of these mentioned 
types of food have already 
undergone chemical 
digestion?
Until the exit of the stomach, 
carbohydrates, in the mouth, and 
proteins, in the stomach, have already 
undergone chemical breaking by 
digestive enzymes. Carbohydrates have 
suffered action of the salivary amylase 
(ptyalin) and proteins have suffered 
action of the enzyme pepsin of the 
gastric juice. Fats, until reaching the 
duodenum, do not undergo chemical 
digestion.
27. What is the substance 
produced in the liver that acts 
in the small intestine during 
digestion? How does that 
substance act in the digestive 
process?
Bile, an emulsifier liquid, is made by the 
liver and later stored within the 
gallbladder and released in the 
duodenum.
Bile is composed of bile salts, 
cholesterol and bile pigments. Bile salts 
are detergents, amphiphilic molecules, 
i.e., molecules with a polar water-
soluble portion and a non-polar fat-
soluble portion. This feature allows bile 
salts to enclose fats inside water-soluble 
micelles in a process called 
emulsification for them to be in contact 
with intestinal lipases, enzymes that 
break fats into simpler fatty acids and 
glycerol.
28. What is the adnexal organ 
of the digestive system in 
which bile is stored? How 
does this organ react to the 
ingestion of fat rich food?
Bile is concentrated and stored in the 
gallbladder.
When fat rich foods are ingested the 
gallbladder contracts to release bile 
inside the duodenum. (This is the 
reason why patients with gallstones 
must not ingest fatty food, the reactive 
contraction of the gallbladder may move 
some of the stones to the point of 
blocking the duct that drains bile into 
the duodenum, causing pain and 
possible severe complications.)

Biology Questions and Answers
Besides making bile for release in the 
duodenum, the liver has other digestive 
functions.
The venous network that absorbs 
nutrients from the guts, called 
mesenteric circulation, drains its blood 
content almost entirely to the hepatic 
portal vein. This vein irrigates the liver 
with absorbed material from the 
digestion. So the liver has the functions 
of storing, processing and inactivating 
nutrients.
Glucose is polymerized into glycogen in 
the liver; this organ also stores many 
vitamins and the iron absorbed in the 
intestine. Some important metabolic 
molecules, like albumin and clotting 
factors, are made in the liver from 
amino acids of the diet. In the liver 
ingested toxic substances, like alcohol 
and drugs, are inactivated too.
30. Besides the liver which is 
the other adnexal gland of the 
digestive system that releases 
substances in the duodenum 
participating in extracellular 
digestion?
The other adnexal gland of the digestive 
system is the pancreas. This organ 
makes digestive enzymes that digest 
proteins (proteases), lipids (lipases) and 
carbohydrates (pancreatic amylases). 
Other digestive enzymes, like 
gelatinase, elastase, carboxipeptidase, 
ribonuclease and deoxyribonuclease are 
also secreted by the pancreas.
31. How does the pancreatic 
juice participate in the 
digestion of proteins? What 
are the involved enzymes?
The pancreas secretes trypsinogen that, 
undergoing action of the enzyme 
enterokinase secreted by the 
duodenum, is transformed into trypsin. 
Trypsin in its turn catalyzes the 
activation of pancreatic 
chymotrypsinogen into chymotrypsin. 
Trypsin and chymotrypsin are proteases 
that break proteins into smaller 
peptides. The smaller peptides are then 
broken into amino acids by the enzyme 
carboxipeptidase (also secreted by the 
pancreas in a zymogen form and 
activated by trypsin) helped by the 
enzyme aminopeptidase made in the 
intestinal mucous membrane.
32. How does the pancreatic 
juice resume the digestion of 
carbohydrates? What is the 
involved enzyme?
Carbohydrate digestion begins with the 
action of the salivary amylase (ptyalin) 
in the mouth and it continues in the 
duodenum by the action of the 
pancreatic juice. This juice contains the 
enzyme pancreatic amylase, or 
amylopsin, that breaks starch (amylum) 
into maltose (a disaccharide made of 
two glucose molecules).

33. How does the pancreatic 
juice help the digestion of 
lipids? What is the involved 
enzyme?
The enzyme pancreatic lipase is present 
in the pancreatic juice. This enzyme 
breaks triacylglycerol (triglyceride) into 
fatty acids and glycerol.
34. Besides the pancreatic 
juice in the intestine there is 
the releasing of the enteric 
juice that contains digestive 
enzymes too. What are these 
enzymes and which type of 
molecule do each of these 
enzymes break?
The enteric juice is secreted by the 
small intestine mucosa. The enzymes of 
the enteric juice and their respective 
functions are described as follows:
Enterokinase: enzyme that activates 
trypsinogen into trypsin. Saccharase: 
enzyme that breaks sucrose 
(saccharose) into glucose and fructose. 
Maltase: enzyme that breaks maltose 
into two glucose molecules. Lactase: 
enzyme that breaks lactose into glucose 
and galactose. Peptidases: enzymes 
that break oligopeptides into amino 
acids. Nucleotidases: Enzymes that 
break nucleotides into its components 
(nitrogen-containing bases, phosphates 
and pentoses).
35. Coming from the acid pH 
of the stomach which pH level 
does the chyme find when it 
enters the duodenum? Why is 
it necessary to maintain that 
pH level in the small intestine? 
What are the organs 
responsible for that pH level 
and how is it kept?
Entering the duodenum the chyme 
meets the pancreatic juice under a pH 
of approximately 8.5. The neutralization 
of the chyme acidity is necessary to 
keep adequate pH level for the 
functioning of the digestive enzymes 
that act in the duodenum. Without the 
neutralization of the chyme acidity the 
mucous membrane of the intestine 
would be injured.
When stimulated by the chyme acidity 
the duodenum makes a hormone called 
secretin. Secretin stimulates the 
pancreas to release the pancreatic juice 
and also the gallbladder to expel bile in 
the duodenum. The pancreatic 
secretion, rich in bicarbonate ions, is 
released in the duodenum and 
neutralizes the chyme acidity; this 
acidity is also neutralized by the 
secretion of bile in the duodenal lumen.
36. What are the five human 
digestive secretions? Which of 
them is the only pne that does 
not contain digestive 
enzymes?
The human digestive secretions are: 
saliva, gastric juice, bile, pancreatic 
juice and enteric juice. Among these

Biology Questions and Answers
secretions only the bile does not contain 
digestive enzymes.
37. Why do protease-
supplying cells of the stomach 
and of the pancreas make only 
precursors of the active 
proteolytic enzymes?
The stomach and the pancreas make 
zymogens of the proteases pepsin, 
chymotrypsin and trypsin and these 
zymogens are released into the gastric 
or duodenal lumen for activation. This 
happens to prevent the digestion of 
these organs' (stomach and pancreas) 
own cells and tissues by the active form 
of the enzymes. So the production of 
zymogens is a protective strategy 
against the natural effects of the 
proteolytic enzymes.
38. After digestion the next 
step is absorption done by 
cells of the mucous membrane 
of the intestine. For this task a 
large absorption surface is an 
advantage. How is it possible 
in the small internal space of 
the body of a pluricellular 
organism to present a large 
intestinal surface?
Evolution tried to solve this problem in 
two ways. The simplest is the long and 
tubular shape of the bowels 
(approximately eight meters in 
extension), making possible that 
numerous small intestine loops fold 
closely. More efficient solutions are the 
intestinal villi and the microvilli of the 
mucosal membrane cells.
The intestinal wall is not smooth. The 
mucous membrane, together with its 
submucosa, projects inside the gut 
lumen like glove fingers forming 
invaginations and villi that multiply the 
available surface for absorption. In 
addition the epithelial cells that cover 
these villi have themselves numerous 
hairlike projections called microvilli on 
the external face (lumen face) of their 
plasma membrane. The absorptive area 
of the intestines is thus increased 
hundreds of times with these solutions.
In the jejunum and ileum there are 
folds that have the function of 
increasing the absorption surface too.
39. In which part of the 
digestive tube is water is 
chiefly absorbed? What about 
the mineral ions and vitamins?
Most part of water, vitamins and 
mineral ions are absorbed by the small 
intestine. The large intestine, however, 
is responsible for the reabsorption of 
nearly 10% of the ingested water, an 
important amount that gives 
consistency to feces (colon diseases can 
cause diarrhea).
40. From the intestinal lumen 
through to the tissues - what 
is the route of nutrients after 
digestion?

Transaction ID: 4KS71350WY6468607

Biology Questions and Answers
Monosaccharides, amino acids, mineral 
salts and water are absorbed by the 
intestinal epithelium and collected by 
capillary vessels of the intestinal villi. 
From the capillaries, nutrients go to the 
mesenteric circulation, a system of 
vessels that drains the intestinal loops. 
The blood of the mesenteric circulation 
is drained to the portal hepatic vein and 
some nutrients are processed by the 
liver. From the liver, nutrients are 
gathered by the hepatic veins that 
discharge its blood content into the 
inferior vena cava. Blood from the 
inferior vena cava then gains the right 
chambers of the heart and is pumped to 
the lungs for oxygenation. From the 
lungs the blood then returns to the 
heart where it is pumped to the tissues 
distributing nutrients and oxygen.
41. What is the special route 
that lipids follow during 
digestion? What are 
chylomicrons?
Triglycerides emulsified by the bile 
within micelles suffer the action of 
lipases that break them into fatty acids 
and glycerol. Fatty acids, glycerol and 
cholesterol are absorbed by the 
intestinal mucosa. In the interior of the 
mucosal cells fatty acids and glycerol 
form again triglycerides that together 
with cholesterol and phospholipids are 
packed in small vesicles covered by 
proteins and called chylomicrons. The 
chylomicrons are released in minuscule 
lymphatic vessels not in blood vessels 
and they gain the lymphatic circulation. 
So the lymphatic system plays an 
important role in the absorption of 
lipids.
The lymphatic circulation drains its 
content to the venous blood circulation. 
In that manner chylomicrons reach the 
liver where their lipid content is 
processed and released in the blood 
under the form of protein-containing 
complexes called lipoproteins, like HDL, 
VLDL and LDL.
42. What are the so-called 
“good” and “bad” cholesterol?
Lipoproteins are complexes made of 
lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol) and 
proteins. The lipoproteins present 
different densities according to the 
relationship between their protein and 
lipid quantities since lipids are less 
dense than proteins. Low-density 
lipoproteins (LDL) are those with a low 
protein/lipid relation; high-density 
lipoproteins (HDL) have a high 
protein/lipid relation; another group is 
the very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) 
with very low protein/lipid relation.
LDL is known as “bad cholesterol” 
because it transports cholesterol from 
the liver to the tissues and so induces 
the formation of atheroma plaques 
inside blood vessels, a condition called 
atherosclerosis (do not confuse with 
arteriosclerosis) that can lead to severe 
circulatory obstructions like acute 
myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular 
accidents and thrombosis. HDL is known 
as “good cholesterol” since it transports 
cholesterol from the tissues to the liver 
(to be eliminated with the bile) and 
elevation of the HDL blood level reduces 
the risk of atherosclerosis. (VLDL 
transforms into LDL after losing 
triglycerides in the blood).

Biology Questions and Answers
43. Why does the ingestion of 
vegetable fibers improve the 
bowel habit in people that 
suffer from hard stools?
Some types of plant fibers are not 
absorbed by the intestine but play an 
important role in the functioning of the 
organ. They retain water inside the 
bowels and thus contribute to the 
softening of the fecal bolus. A softer 
fecal bolus is easier to be eliminated 
during defecation. People that eat less 
dietary fiber may suffer from hard stools 
and constipation.
44. What are the main 
functions of the bacterial flora 
within the human gut?
Bacteria that live inside the gut have 
great importance in digestion. Some 
polysaccharides like cellulose, 
hemicellulose and pectin are not 
digested by the digestive enzymes 
secreted by the body, instead, they are 
broken by enzymes released by bacteria 
of the gastrointestinal tract. The 
intestinal bacterial flora also make vital 
substances for the functioning of the 
bowels facilitating or blocking the 
absorption of nutrients and stimulating 
or reducing peristalsis. Some gut 
bacteria are the main source of vitamin 
K for the body and so they are essential 
for the blood clotting process.
In the intestinal flora there are utile but 
also potentially harmful bacteria. It is 
estimated that more than 100 trillion 
bacteria live in a human gut. Some 
bacteria are useful too because they 
compete with other species preventing 
excessive proliferation of these bacteria.
45. The releasing of digestive 
secretions is controlled by 
hormones. What are the 
hormones that participate in 
this regulation?
The hormones that participate in the 
regulation of digestion are gastrin, 
secretin, cholecystokin and 
enterogastrone.
46. How is it produced and 
what is the function of gastrin 
in the digestive process?
The presence of food in the stomach 
stimulates the secretion of gastrin that 
in its turn triggers the releasing of the 
gastric juice.
47. Where is it produced and 
what is the function of 
secretin in the digestive 
process?
Secretin is made in the duodenum. The 
chyme acidity causes the duodenum to 
release this hormone that in its turn 
stimulates the secretion of the 
pancreatic juice.

48. How is it produced and 
what is the function of 
cholecystokin in the digestive 
process?
The fat level of the chyme detected in 
the duodenum stimulates the secretion 
of cholecystokin (CCK). CCK acts by 
stimulating the secretion of the 
pancreatic juice also, and the releasing 
of bile by the gallbladder.
49. Where is it produced and 
what is the function of 
enterogastrone in the 
digestive process?
When the chyme is too fatty there is a 
secretion of enterogastrone by the 
duodenum. This hormone reduces the 
peristalsis of the stomach thus slowing 
the entrance of food into the duodenum 
(as the digestion of fats takes more 
time).
50. What are the special 
structures of the avian 
digestive tube and their 
respective functions?
The digestive tube of birds has special 
structures, in this sequential order: the 
crop, the proventriculus and the gizzard.
The crop has the function of temporary 
storage of ingested food and it is a more 
dilated area of the avian esophagus. 
The proventriculus is the chemical 
stomach of the birds where food is 
mixed with digestive enzymes. The 
gizzard is a muscular pouch that serves 
as a mechanical stomach where the 
food is ground to increase the exposure 
area of the food particles for the 
digestive enzymes to act.
51. Compared to mammals do 
birds absorb more or less 
water in their digestive 
system? Why is this 
phenomenon an adaptation to 
flight?
Bird feces are more liquid than mammal 
feces, i.e., less water is absorbed in the 
avian digestive system. The more 
frequent elimination of feces in birds 
due to their less solid feces is an 
adaptation to flight since their body 
weight is kept lower.
52. What is meant by 
“mutualist exploration of 
cellulose digestion”, a 
phenomenon that occurs in 
some mammals and insects?
Herbivorous animals eat great amounts 
of cellulose, a substance not digested by 
their digestive enzymes. In these 
animals regions of the digestive tube 
are colonized by microorganisms that 
digest cellulose. This mutualist 
ecological interaction between animals 
and microorganisms occurs, e.g., in 
horses, cows, rabbits and in some 
insects such as termites.

53. Cows swallow their food 
once and then this food goes 
back to the mouth to be 
chewed again. How can this 
phenomenon be explained?
The food ingested by cows and other 
ruminant animals passes first within two 
compartments of the digestive tube 
called the rumen and the reticulum. 
Within them the food suffers the action 
of digestive enzymes released by 
microorganisms that live there in 
mutualist ecological interaction. In the 
reticulum the food is divided in some 
food bolus too. After passing the 
reticulum the food (cud) is regurgitated 
to the mouth to be again chewed and 
swallowed in a process called 
rumination. The digesting food then 
enters the omasum where it is 
mechanically mixed. After that the food 
goes to the abomasum, the organ 
where the chemical digestion takes 
place. After leaving the abomasum (the 
true stomach) the food bolus gains the 
intestine.

Biology Questions and Answers
Respiratory System
1. What is the difference 
between respiration meaning 
gas exchange and cellular 
respiration?
Respiration meaning gas exchange is 
the process in which an organism 
absorbs from the environment gases 
necessary for its cellular metabolism 
and expels gases that are products of 
this metabolism. Cellular respiration 
(aerobic or anaerobic) is the chemical 
reaction in which organic molecules are 
degraded to make ATP molecules, the 
main energy source for the metabolism.
Gas exchange is fundamental for 
cellular respiration since the supplying 
of some reagents (oxygen, in aerobic 
cellular respiration) and the expelling of 
some products (e.g., carbon dioxide) of 
this chemical reaction depends on gas 
exchange.
2. What is the chemical 
equation of the aerobic 
cellular respiration?
The chemical equation of the aerobic 
cellular respiration is the following:
C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 36 ADP + 36 P --> 
6 CO2 + 6 H2O + 36 ATP
3. Considering the chemical 
equation of the aerobic 
cellular respiration which 
molecules does the cell need 
and which molecules does it 
liberate in the process?
Considering the chemical equation of 
the aerobic cellular respiration it is 
observed that glucose and molecular 
oxygen are needed as reagents and 
carbon dioxide and water are released. 
The process also spends ADP and 
phosphate that turn into ATP.
4. What are the different types 
of gas exchange that occur in 
animals?
In beings from the kingdom Animalia 
the gas exchange may occur either by 
diffusion, tracheal respiration, 
cutaneous respiration, branchial 
respiration or pulmonary respiration.
5. Oxygen comes from the 
environment and carbon 
dioxide in the end returns to 
the environment. How do 
small animals solve the 
problem of taking away and 
bringing these molecules 
from/to their cells? Why isn't 
that solution possible for 
larger animals?
Small animals whose tissues make 
direct contact or are very close to the

environment, like cnidarians and 
poriferans, make gas exchange by 
diffusion.
Larger animals with cells without direct 
contact with the environment or far 
from it need special gas transportation 
systems. In these animals the 
respiratory and the circulatory systems 
play this role.
6. Beings from four phyla of 
the animal kingdom “breath” 
(do gas exchange) by 
diffusion. Which are those 
phyla? How is this type of 
respiration associated to 
features present in those 
animals?
The phyla of the animal kingdom whose 
beings do gas exchange by diffusion are 
the poriferans, the cnidarians, the 
platyelminthes (flatworms) and the 
nematodes (roundworms). This type of 
respiration in these beings is possible 
because their tissues and cells are 
relatively close to the exterior.
7. Which animals make 
tracheal respiration? Is there 
a blood-like fluid that 
participates in this process?
Insects and arachnids are the arthropod 
animals that make tracheal respiration. 
In the body surface of these animals 
there are many orifices called spiracles 
that communicate with small tubules, 
the tracheae, through which air 
penetrates and carbon dioxide is 
expelled. The tracheae ramify into 
tracheoles that reach all tissues of the 
animal.
In the circulatory system of insects the 
blood only transports nutrients; gases 
are independently transported by the 
tracheal system.
8. What is the difference 
between respiration by 
diffusion and cutaneous 
respiration? Does blood 
participate in cutaneous 
respiration?
Cutaneous respiration is not as simple 
as diffusion. In diffusion the gases 
diffuse directly between the external 
environment and the cells. In cutaneous 
respiration molecular oxygen penetrates 
through the skin and it is collected by 
the blood circulation that then 
distributes the gas to the tissues. 
Carbon dioxide is also collected from the 
tissues by the blood and taken to the 
skin to be eliminated to the 
environment. So there is important 
participation of blood in cutaneous 
respiration.
9. Which animals make 
cutaneous respiration?
Terrestrial annelids and adult 
amphibians make cutaneous respiration 
(in amphibians there is also pulmonary 
respiration).

The thin skin and the need for living in 
moist surrounds are typical features of

10. What are branchiae? What 
are examples of animals that 
“breath” through branchiae?
Branchiae, also known as gills, are small 
portions of richly vascularized tissues 
internal or external to the body and in 
direct contact with the surrounding 
water. The gills are organs that make 
gas exchange in aquatic annelids, 
crustaceans, fishes and amphibian 
larvae (e.g., tadpoles).
11. What is the difference 
between gills and lungs?
Gills and lungs are richly vascularized 
organs that serve for gas exchange 
between the environment and the 
circulatory system.
The lungs differentiate from gills in that 
they are saclike structures always 
internal to the organism and specialized 
in gas exchange in terrestrial 
environment. Branchiae, in their turn, 
are internal or external laminar 
structures in direct contact with water 
and specialized in gas exchange in 
aquatic environment.
12. Besides vertebrates two 
invertebrate phyla contain 
species that make pulmonary 
respiration. Which are these 
phyla?
Terrestrial molluscs and the arachnid 
arthropods are the invertebrates that 
present pulmonary-like respiration. 
Some terrestrial molluscs have a mantle 
cavity filled with air that makes contact 
with richly vascularized tissues that 
work as rudimentary lungs. Besides 
their tracheal respiration some 
arachnids have book lungs (thin folds 
resembling leaves of a book) that make 
gas exchange.
13. What are the three types 
of respiration in which the 
circulatory system transports 
gases?
The circulatory system has an important 
role in cutaneous respiration, branchial 
respiration and pulmonary respiration. 
The respiratory function of the blood is 
tailored for transportation of gases for 
exchange between tissues and 
respiratory surfaces in contact with the 
exterior (skin, gills, lungs).
14. What are respiratory 
pigments? What are some 
respiratory pigments and in 
which animal groups can each 
of them be found?

Biology Questions and Answers
Respiratory pigments are molecules 
present in the blood that bind to oxygen 
transporting it to the tissues.
In vertebrates the respiratory pigment 
is hemoglobin, reddish due to the iron 
of its composition. In crustacean and 
arachnid arthropods and in some 
molluscs the respiratory pigment is 
hemocyanin, blue due to the copper of 
its composition. Annelids have 
hemoglobin, hemerythrin and 
chlorocruorin as respiratory pigments.
15. What are the organs that 
form the human respiratory 
system?
The organs that are part of the human 
respiratory system can be divided into 
three groups: lungs, airway and 
respiratory muscles.
The lungs are the right and the left 
lungs made of alveoli where gas 
exchange (entrance of oxygen and exit 
of carbon dioxide) takes place; the 
lungs are covered by the pleura (a 
serous membrane). The airway 
comprehends the nose, the pharynx, 
the larynx (including the vocal cords), 
the trachea, the bronchi and the 
bronchioles. The muscles upon which 
the breathing process depends are 
mainly the diaphragm and the 
intercostal muscles (muscles between 
the ribs).
16. What is the anatomical 
reason for the left bronchus to 
be more elevated than the 
right bronchus? Why in most 
cases of aspiration of foreign 
material by children is the 
object found in the right 
bronchus?
The left bronchus is more elevated than 
the right bronchus because of the 
position of the heart in the left side of 
the chest, anterior and inferior to the 
left bronchus.
Accidentally aspired objects are 
frequently found in the right bronchus 
because the inferior angle between the 
trachea and this bronchus is lower than 
the inferior angle between the trachea 
and the left bronchus since the left 
bronchus is more horizontalized. 
Therefore aspired objects tend to fall in 
the right side (bronchus) and not in the 
left.
17. How does the body defend 
itself from microorganisms 
and other harmful substances 
that enter the airway during 
the breathing process?
The epithelium of the airway is a ciliated 
epithelium and has mucus-secreting 
specialized cells. The secreted mucus 
covers the internal wall of the airway 
retaining organisms and foreign 
particles that then are swept by the cilia 
of the epithelium.
In the mucous ciliated epithelium of the 
airway there is also intense activity of

the immune system with antibodies and 
leukocytes inactivating and destroying 
foreign agents.
Other defense mechanisms of the 
airway are the sneeze and the cough. 
They help the elimination of solid and 
semifluid particles like pathologic 
residuals (sputum) and accidentally 
aspired objects.
18. Which are the respiratory 
muscles in mammals?
In mammals the muscles that 
participate in the breathing process are 
the diaphragm and the intercostal 
muscles. In respiratory insufficiency 
other muscles can help the respiration, 
the muscles of the shoulders, neck, 
thorax and abdomen.
19. How are inhalation and 
expiration carried out?
The diaphragm (exclusive of mammals) 
and the intercostal muscles can contract 
or relax varying the volume of the 
thorax (the compartment where the 
lungs are located). The changing of the 
thorax volume forces inhalation or 
expiration.
When the thorax volume is increased an 
internal pressure lower than the 
atmospheric pressure (external) is 
created and gases naturally enter the 
lungs. When the thorax volume is 
lowered the internal pressure rises 
above the external pressure and the air 
is expelled from the lungs.
20. What is the difference 
between arterial and venous 
blood?
Arterial blood is the oxygen-rich and 
carbon dioxide-poor blood that irrigates 
the tissues. Venous blood is the oxygen-
poor and carbon dioxide-rich blood 
collected from the tissues.
21. What is hematosis? In 
humans where does 
hematosis occur?
Hematosis is the oxygenation of the 
blood. Venous blood (oxygen-poor) 
after hematosis is transformed into 
arterial blood (oxygen-rich).
In humans hematosis takes place in the 
lungs.
22. What are the blood vessels 
that carry venous blood to the 
heart? What is the blood 
vessel that collects arterial 
blood from the heart?
The blood vessels that debouch in the 
heart carrying venous blood are the

blood vessel that carries arterial blood 
from the heart is the aorta.

Biology Questions and Answers
The gas exchange units of the 
mammalian lungs are the alveoli.
24. What is the physical 
process through which gas 
exchange is accomplished in 
the pulmonary alveoli?
The gas exchange (entry of oxygen and 
exit of carbon dioxide) in the pulmonary 
alveoli occurs by simple diffusion in 
favor of the partial pressure gradient.
When the oxygen partial pressure in the 
inhaled air is higher than the oxygen 
partial pressure of the capillaries of the 
alveoli the air diffuses to the circulatory 
system. If the oxygen partial pressure 
in the air is lower (a rare situation since 
the blood that reaches the alveoli is 
venous blood) the oxygen exits the 
circulatory system. The same is true for 
carbon dioxide.
25. What is the structure of 
the central nervous system 
that regulates pulmonary 
respiration?
The pulmonary respiration is controlled 
by the neural respiratory center located 
within the medulla (the lower part of the 
brain continuous to the spinal cord).
26. What is the chemical 
equation of the formation of 
bicarbonate from carbon 
dioxide and water? What is 
the enzyme that catalyzes this 
reaction?
The chemical equation of the chemical 
equilibrium of the formation of 
bicarbonate having as reagents carbon 
dioxide and water is as follows:
CO2 + H20 --> H2CO3 --> H+ + HCO3
-
The reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme 
carbonic anhydrase present in red blood 
cells.
27. What are the 
consequences of shifting the 
chemical equilibrium of the 
formation of bicarbonate from 
carbon dioxide and water 
towards the increase of 
product (bicarbonate) 
formation?
The increase in product formation in the 
chemical equilibrium of the formation of 
bicarbonate from carbon dioxide and 
water heightens the concentration of 
hydrogen ions and thus lowers the pH of 
the solution.

28. What are the 
consequences of shifting the 
chemical equilibrium of the 
formation of bicarbonate from 
carbon dioxide and water 
towards the consumption of 
products of the reverse 
reaction?
The shifting of the chemical equilibrium 
of the formation of bicarbonate from 
carbon dioxide and water into the 
reverse reaction (production of water 
and carbon dioxide) means spending of 
hydrogen ions and thus it increases the 
solution pH.
29. How does the pulmonary 
ventilation affect the carbon 
dioxide concentration in 
blood? What happens to the 
carbon dioxide concentration 
and to the blood pH when the 
respiratory frequency is either 
lowered or increased?
The pulmonary ventilation frequency 
(number of inhalations per time unit) 
rises or lowers the carbon dioxide 
concentration in blood. If it is intense 
the gas is more eliminated to the 
exterior and if it is reduced the gas is 
retained inside the organism.
Applying the principles of chemical 
equilibriums to the formation of 
bicarbonate from carbon dioxide and 
water one gets the following: if the 
carbon dioxide concentration is 
increased the equilibrium shifts towards 
the formation of bicarbonate and 
liberation of hydrogen ions and the pH 
of the solution is lowered; if the carbon 
dioxide concentration is lowered the 
equilibrium shifts reversely towards the 
formation of water and carbon dioxide 
and also of more hydrogen ions 
spending and the pH of the solution is 
raised.
30. What are acidosis and 
alkalosis?
Acidosis is the condition in which the 
blood pH is abnormally low. Alkalosis is 
the condition in which the blood pH is 
abnormally high. Normal pH levels for 
the human blood are between 7.35 and 
7.45 - slightly alkaline.
31. How does the breathing 
process correct acidosis?
If the body experiences acidosis the 
respiratory center located in the medulla 
gets the information and induces the 
increase of the respiratory frequency. 
The increment of the respiratory 
frequency makes the body eliminate 
more carbon dioxide and to shift the 
equilibrium of the formation of 
bicarbonate towards the spending of 
more hydrogen ions and thus the blood 
pH raises.
32. How does the breathing 
process correct alkalosis?
If the body undergoes alkalosis the 
respiratory center located in the medulla 
gets the information and induces the 
lowering of the respiratory frequency.

The reduction of the respiratory 
frequency makes the body retain more 
carbon dioxide and to shift the 
equilibrium of the formation of 
bicarbonate towards the production of 
more hydrogen ions and thus the blood 
pH lowers.
33. What is the difference 
between respiratory acidosis 
and metabolic acidosis and 
what is the difference 
between respiratory alkalosis 
and metabolic alkalosis?
Respiratory acidosis is that in which the 
blood pH is low due to increased 
retention of carbon dioxide caused by 
the lowering of the respiratory 
frequency or by pulmonary diseases 
that impair the gas exchange. So the 
cause of the respiratory acidosis is the 
pulmonary respiration. Metabolic 
acidosis is that in which the blood pH is 
low not due to the pulmonary retention 
of carbon dioxide but due to metabolic 
disturbances. Some metabolic 
disturbances result in liberation in the 
blood of nonvolatile acids that release 
hydrogen ions lowering the blood pH 
(e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis).
Respiratory alkalosis is that in which the 
pH is high due to increased expelling of 
carbon dioxide caused by elevated 
respiratory frequency. Metabolic 
alkalosis is the alkalosis caused by 
metabolic disturbances that increase the 
concentration of bases (alkalis) in the 
blood.
34. Where are the 
chemoreceptors that detect 
the acidity of the blood and 
trigger the respiratory 
compensation located?
The chemoreceptors that participate in 
the ventilation control are structures 
that collect information about the acidity 
and alkalinity of the blood. The 
information is then transmitted by 
nervous fibers to the respiratory center 
located within the medulla. The center 
then commands the respiratory muscles 
to compensate the abnormal pH.
There are central and peripheral 
chemoreceptors. Peripheral 
chemoreceptors of pH, carbon dioxide 
partial pressure and oxygen partial 
pressure are located in the walls of the 
aorta and of the carotid arteries. Central 
chemoreceptors that get pH information 
are located within the medulla in the 
respiratory center. (The pulmonary 
ventilation is also controlled by 
receptors that receive pH information 
from the cerebrospinal fluid.)

Biology Questions and Answers
Circulatory System
1. What is circulation?
Circulation is the movement of 
substances like nutrients and gases 
within blood vessels and cavities 
throughout the organism.
2. Do all animals have a 
circulatory system?
Not all animals have a circulatory 
system.
Poriferans, cnidarians, platyhelminthes 
and nematodes (in these there are the 
pseudocoelom fluid but no vessels) are 
avascular animals. Echinoderms do not 
have true circulatory systems either.
3. What is the alternative 
means for transport of 
substances in animals without 
a circulatory system? Why is 
blood important for larger 
animals?
In animals that do not present the 
circulatory system the transport of 
substances occurs by cell to cell 
diffusion.
The blood is a fundamental means of 
substance transport for larger animals 
since in these animals there are tissues 
distant from each other and from the 
environment thus making diffusion 
impossible.
4. What are the two types of 
circulatory systems?
The circulatory systems can be classified 
into open circulatory system and closed 
circulatory system.
5. What is an open circulatory 
system?
Open circulatory system is the one in 
which blood does not circulate only 
inside blood vessels but it also falls in 
cavities that irrigate tissues. In the open 
circulatory system the blood pressure is 
low and generally the blood (called 
hemolymph) has low cellularity.
Arthropods, molluscs (the cephalopods 
are exception) and protochordates have 
open circulatory system.
6. What is a closed circulatory 
system?
A closed circulatory system is one in 
which blood circulates only inside blood 
vessels. For this reason the blood 
pressure is higher in animals with closed 
circulatory system. The cellularity of the 
blood is also higher with many specific 
blood cells.
The closed circulatory system is a 
feature of annelids, cephalopod molluscs 
and vertebrates.

Biology Questions and Answers
7. What are the advantages of 
the closed circulatory system 
over the open circulatory 
system?
The closed circulatory system is more 
efficient. Since blood circulates only 
inside blood vessels it can do it with 
more pressure reaching farther 
distances between the organs where 
hematosis happens and the peripheral 
tissues. In addition the circulatory speed 
also heightens making possible more 
oxygen supply to great consuming 
tissues, like the muscle tissues that 
then can perform faster movements. 
Animals with an open circulatory system 
(with the exception of insects that do 
gas exchange independently from the 
circulation) are generally slower and 
have a low metabolic rate.
8. What is the difference 
between octopuses and 
mussels regarding their 
circulatory systems? How 
does that difference influence 
the mobility of these animals?
Cephalopod molluscs, like octopuses 
and squids, have a closed circulatory 
system with blood pumped under 
pressure flowing within vessels. Bivalve 
molluscs, like mussels and oysters, have 
an open circulatory system (also known 
as lacunar circulatory system) where 
blood flows under low pressure since it 
falls in cavities of the body and does not 
only circulate within blood vessels. 
Molluscs with closed circulatory systems 
are larger, agile and can actively move; 
molluscs with open circulatory systems 
are smaller, slow and some are 
practically sessile.
9. Why, even thoough they 
have an open circulatory 
system, can flying insects like 
flies beat their wings with 
great speed?
In insects the circulatory system is open 
but this system does not participate in 
the gas exchange process and in oxygen 
supply to the tissues. Gases go in and 
out through the independent tracheal 
system that allows direct contact of cells 
with the ambient air. Therefore an 
insect can supply the great oxygen 
demand of its fast-beating wing muscles 
even having open circulatory system.
10. What are the typical 
components of a closed 
circulatory system?
The typical components of the closed 
circulatory system are the blood vessels 
within which blood circulates (arteries, 
veins and capillaries), a pumping organ 
(heart) and the blood or bloodlike fluid.
11. How does the heart impel 
the blood?
The heart is a muscular organ that 
contains chambers (right atrium and 
right ventricle and left atrium and right 
ventricle) through which blood passes. 
The blood enters the heart in the atria,

Biology Questions and Answers
goes to the ventricles and then leaves 
the organ.
The blood is pumped out of the heart by 
the contraction of the muscle fibers that 
form the ventricular walls. The 
contraction reduces the ventricle 
volume thus increasing the internal 
pressure and the blood then flows to the 
exit vessels (pulmonary artery for the 
right ventricle and aorta for the left 
ventricle). When ventricular muscle 
fibers distend the ventricles regain their 
original size and receive new blood flow 
coming from the atria.
12. What is the difference 
between systole and diastole
Systole and diastole are the two stages 
into which the cardiac cycle is divided. 
Systole is the stage when the 
contraction of ventricular muscle fibers 
occurs and the ventricles are emptied. 
Diastole is the stage of the cardiac cycle 
when the ventricular muscle fibers 
distend and the ventricles are filled with 
blood.
13. What are arterial vessels, 
arteries and arterioles?
Arterial vessels are every blood vessel 
that carries blood from the heart to the 
tissues. Arteries and arterioles are 
arterial vessels. Arterioles are thin 
arteries that end in capillaries.
Not all arteries however contain arterial 
blood (highly oxygenated blood). The 
pulmonary artery and its ramifications, 
arteries that carry blood from the right 
heart ventricle to the lungs, contain 
venous blood.
14. What are venous vessels, 
veins and venules?
Venous vessels are every blood vessel 
that carries blood from the tissues to 
the heart. Veins and venules are venous 
vessels. Venules are thin veins that are 
continuous to capillaries.
In general venous vessels carry venous 
blood. The pulmonary veins that carry 
blood from the lungs to the left atrium 
of the heart however contain arterial 
blood.
15. What are the capillaries of 
the vascular system?
Capillaries are small blood vessels that 
perform exchange of substances 
between the blood and the body tissues. 
Capillaries are neither arteries nor are 
they veins since they have distinct 
features. In capillaries the wall is made 
of a single layer of endothelial cells 
through which substances are 
exchanged. These vessels receive blood 
from the arterioles and drain to the 
venules.
16. What is the part of the 
vascular system that performs 
exchange of gases and other 
substances with the tissues?
www.biology-questions-and-answers.com

Buyer: Victoria Proctor (vicproc6@gmail.com)
Transaction ID: 4KS71350WY6468607

Biology Questions and Answers
Only capillaries perform exchange of 
gases and other substances with the 
tissues.
17. Are the arteries or the 
veins constituted of more 
muscle tissue? How different 
are the walls of these two 
types of blood vessels?
The arterial system has thicker muscle 
walls since within arteries the blood 
circulates under higher pressure. The 
veins are more flaccid than arteries.
From the lumen to the external layer 
both types of vessels are made of 
endothelium, muscle tissue and 
connective tissue. In both the 
endothelium is a single layer of cells. In 
arteries the muscle tissue portion is 
thicker than in veins and in these 
vessels the external connective tissue is 
thicker than in arteries.
Arteries are the pulsating blood vessels. 
The arterial pulse can be felt in a 
medical examination, for example, by 
the palpation of the radial artery in the 
internal and lateral face of the wrist 
near the base of the thumb.
18. What are the valves of the 
venous system? What is their 
function?
The valves of the venous system are 
structures inside the veins that permit 
blood to flow only in the normal way 
(from the tissues to the heart) and 
forbid it to return in the reverse way in 
favor of gravity. The valves close when 
the pressure of the fluid column above 
(after, regarding normal flux) is higher 
than the fluid pressure before them. 
Valves are thus fundamental for the 
returning of blood to the heart.
19. How do the muscles of the 
legs and of the feet contribute 
to the venous return?
The muscles of the legs, mainly the 
muscles of the calves, contract and 
compress the deep veins of the legs 
impelling the blood to the heart.
The plantar portion of the feet retains 
blood and when it is compressed against 
the ground it impels its blood volume 
and aids venous return.
20. What are varices? Why are 
they more common in the 
inferior limbs?
Varix means abnormal enlargement of 
veins. Varices occur when excessive 
pressure against the normal blood flux 
creates enlargement of the vein and 
thus insufficient functioning of its valves 
(venous insufficiency).
Varices are more common in the veins 
of the inferior limbs since the fluid 
column above these vessels is higher. 
This is the reason why people that 
spend much time standing (e.g., 
surgeons) are more susceptible to 
varices.
In general varices are not the apparent 
superficial veins that appear in the leg

of varix patients. These apparent 
vessels are the consequences of internal 
varices (venous insufficiency) in the 
deep internal veins of the legs and they 
appear because the blood flux is 
diverted to superficial veins. (Popularly 
however apparent superficial veins are 
called varices.)
21. What is the lymphatic 
system?
The lymphatic system is a network of 
specialized valved vessels that drain 
interstitial fluid (lymph). The lymphatic 
system is also responsible for the 
transport of chylomicrons (vesicles that 
contain lipids) made after the 
absorption of fats by the intestinal 
epithelium.
In the way of the lymphatic vessels 
there are ganglial-like structures called 
lymph nodes that contain many cells of 
the immune system. These cells filter 
impurities and destroy microorganisms 
and cellular wastes. The lymphatic 
vessels drain to two major lymphatic 
vessels, the thoracic duct and the right 
lymphatic duct, that in their turns drain 
into tributary veins of the superior vena 
cava.
22. Why in inflammatory and 
infectious conditions may 
clinical signs related to the 
lymphatic system occur?
The lymph nodes, or lymph glands, 
have lymphoid tissue that produces 
lymphocytes (a type of leukocyte). In 
inflammatory and infectious conditions 
the enlargement of lymph nodes of the 
lymphatic circuits that drain the affected 
region due to the reactive proliferation 
of leukocytes is common. This 
enlargement is known as 
lymphadenomegaly and sometimes it is 
accompanied by pain. The search for 
enlarged or painful lymph nodes is part 
of the medical examination since these 
findings may suggest inflammation, 
infection or other diseases.
23. Which are the heart 
chambers respectively where 
the entrance and the exit of 
blood occur?
The heart chambers through which 
blood enters the heart are the atria. 
There are the right atrium and the left 
atrium.
The heart chambers through which the 
blood exits the heart are the ventricles. 
There are the right ventricle and the left 
ventricle.
24. Concerning the thickness 
of their walls how different 
are the heart chambers?
The ventricle walls are thicker than the 
atrium walls since ventricles are 
structures responsible for the pumping 
of the blood to the lungs or tissues. The 
muscular work of the ventricles is 
harder and their muscle fibers develop 
more.
The left ventricle is more muscular than 
the right ventricle because pumping

blood to the lungs (the right ventricle 
task) is easier (needs less pressure) 
than pumping blood to the other tissues 
of the body (the left ventricle task).
25. What is vena cava? Which 
type of blood circulates within 
the vena cava?
The vena cava are either of two large 
veins that debouch into the right atrium. 
The superior vena cava drains all blood 
that comes from the head, the superior 
limbs, the neck and the superior portion 
of the trunk. The inferior vena cava 
carries blood drained from the inferior 
portion of the trunk and the inferior 
limbs.
Venous blood circulates within the vena 
cava.
26. Which is the first (human) 
heart chamber into which 
blood enters? Where does the 
blood go after passing that 
chamber? What is the name of 
the valve that separates the 
compartments? Why is that 
valve necessary?
The venous blood that comes from the 
tissues arrives in the right atrium of the 
heart. From the right atrium the blood 
goes to the right ventricle. The valve 
that separates the right ventricle from 
the right atrium is the tricuspid valve (a 
valvular system made of three leaflets). 
The tricuspid valve is necessary to 
prevent returning of blood to the right 
atrium during systole (contraction of 
ventricles).
27. What is the function of the 
right ventricle? To where does 
the right ventricle pump the 
venous blood?
The function of the right ventricle is to 
get venous blood from the right atrium 
and pump the blood to be oxygenated in 
the lungs.
The venous blood is carried from the 
right ventricle to the lungs by the 
pulmonary artery and their 
ramifications.
28. What is the valve that 
separates the right ventricle 
from the pulmonary artery? 
Why is that valve important?
The valve that separates the right 
ventricle and the base of the pulmonary 
artery is the pulmonary valve. The 
pulmonary valve is important to prevent 
blood from the pulmonary circulation to 
flow back to the heart during diastole.
29. Do the arteries that carry 
blood from the heart to the 
lungs contain arterial or 
venous blood? What happens 
to the blood when it passes 
through the lungs?

Biology Questions and Answers
Arteries of the pulmonary circulation are 
arteries that carry venous blood and not 
arterial blood.
When the blood passes within the 
alveolar capillaries of the lungs 
hematosis (oxygenation) occurs and 
carbon dioxide is released to the 
exterior.
30. What and how many are 
the pulmonary veins?
The pulmonary veins are part of the 
pulmonary circulation. They are vessels 
that carry oxygen-rich (arterial) blood 
from the lungs to the heart. There are 
four pulmonary veins, two that drain 
blood from the right lung and other two 
that drain the left lung. The pulmonary 
veins debouch into the left atrium 
bringing arterial blood to the heart. 
Although they are veins they carry 
arterial blood and not venous blood.
31. To which heart chamber 
does the blood go after 
leaving the left atrium? What 
is the valve that separates 
these compartments?
The arterial blood that has come from 
the lungs to the left atrium passes then 
to the left ventricle.
The valve between the left ventricle and 
the left atrium is the mitral valve, a 
bicuspid (two leaflets) valve. The mitral 
valve is important because it prevents 
the regurgitation of blood to the left 
atrium during systole (contraction of the 
ventricles).
32. What is the function of the 
left ventricle? Where does the 
blood go after leaving the left 
ventricle?
The function of the left ventricle is to 
get blood from the left atrium and to 
pump the blood under high pressure to 
the systemic circulation. After leaving 
the left ventricle the blood enters the 
aorta, the largest artery of the body.
33. What is the valve that 
separates the aorta from the 
heart? What is the importance 
of that valve?
The valve between the left ventricle and 
the aorta is the aortic valve. The aortic 
valve prevents the retrograde flux of 
blood to the left ventricle during 
diastole. Besides, as the aortic valve 
closes during diastole, part of the 
retrograde blood flux is impelled 
through the coronary ostia (openings), 
orifices located in the aorta wall just 
after the valvular insertion and 
contiguous to the coronary circulation 
responsible for the blood supply of the 
cardiac tissues.

larger during systole or during 
diastole?

Biology Questions and Answers
Systole is the stage of the cardiac cycle 
on which the ventricles contract. So the 
lumen of these chambers is reduced and 
the pressure upon the blood within 
them is heightened.
During diastole the opposite occurs. The 
muscle fibers of the ventricles relax and 
the lumen of these chambers enlarges 
helping the entrance of blood.
35. What is the stage of the 
cardiac cycle during which the 
ventricles are filled?
The filling of the ventricles with blood 
occurs during diastole.
36. Of which type of tissue is 
the heart made? How is this 
tissue oxygenated and 
nutrified?
The heart is made of striated cardiac 
muscle tissue. The heart muscle is 
called the myocardium and it is 
oxygenated and nutrified by the 
coronary arteries. The coronary arteries 
come from the base of the aorta and 
ramify around the heart penetrating the 
myocardium.
Diseases of the coronary arteries are 
severe conditions.
37. Which are the two main 
metabolic gases transported 
by the blood?
The main metabolic gases transported 
by the blood are molecular oxygen (O2) 
and carbon dioxide (CO2).
38. How do respiratory 
pigments act?
Respiratory pigments are oxygen-
carrying molecules present in the blood. 
When the oxygen concentration is high, 
for example, in the pulmonary alveoli, 
the respiratory pigments bind to the 
gas. In conditions of low oxygen 
concentration, e.g., in tissues, the 
respiratory pigments release the 
molecule.
In the human blood the respiratory 
pigment is hemoglobin, present within 
the red blood cells.
39. How different are 
oxyhemoglobin and 
hemoglobin? Where is it 
expected to find a higher 
concentration of 
oxyhemoglobin, in peripheral 
tissues or in the lungs?
Oxygen-bound hemoglobin is called 
oxyhemoglobin. In the lungs the oxygen 
concentration is higher and so there is a 
higher oxyhemoglobin concentration. In 
the peripheral tissues the situation is 
the reverse, the concentration of 
oxygen is lower and there is more free 
hemoglobin.

Biology Questions and Answers
40. What is hemoglobin F? 
Why does the fetus need a 
different hemoglobin?
Hemoglobin F is the hemoglobin found 
in the mammalian fetus and hemoglobin 
A is the normal hemoglobin. 
Hemoglobin F has higher affinity for 
oxygen.
The fetus needs hemoglobin capable of 
extracting oxygen from the mother’s 
circulation. Therefore the fetus uses 
hemoglobin F since it has higher affinity 
for oxygen than the mother’s 
hemoglobin.
41. In high altitudes is it 
necessary for the blood to 
have more or less 
hemoglobin?
In high altitudes the air is rarefied and 
oxygen concentration is lower than in 
low altitudes. In this situation the 
efficiency of the respiratory system 
must be greater and thus the organism 
synthesizes more hemoglobin (and 
more red blood cells) trying to get more 
oxygen. This phenomenon is known as 
compensatory hyperglobulinemia.
The compensatory hyperglobulinemia is 
the reason why athletes that will 
compete in high altitudes need to arrive 
in the place some days before the event 
so there is time for their body to make 
more red blood cells and they will be 
less affected by the effects of the low 
atmospheric oxygen concentration 
(fatigue, reduced muscular strength).
42. What is the substance that 
stimulates the production of 
red blood cells? Which is the 
organ that secretes it? Under 
what conditions does this 
secretion increase?
The substance that stimulates the 
production of red blood cells by the 
bone marrow is erythropoietin. 
Erythropoietin is a hormone secreted by 
the kidneys. Its secretion is increased 
when there is deficient tissue 
oxygenation (tissue hypoxia) caused 
either by reduced oxygen availability (as 
it occurs in high altitudes) or by internal 
diseases, as in pulmonary diseases.
43. Why is carbon monoxide 
toxic for humans?
Hemoglobin “likes” carbon monoxide 
(CO) much more than it likes oxygen. 
When there is carbon monoxide in the 
inhaled air it binds to hemoglobin 
forming carboxyhemoglobin by 
occupying the binding site where 
oxygen would bind. Due to the higher 
hemoglobin affinity for carbon monoxide 
thus (e.g., in intoxication from car 
exhausts) there is no oxygen transport 
and the individual undergoes hypoxia, 
loses conscience, inhales more carbon 
monoxide and may even die.
Intoxication by carbon monoxide is an 
important cause of death in fires and in 
closed garages.

44. What is the stage of 
cellular respiration during 
which carbon dioxide is 
liberated?
In aerobic cellular respiration the 
release of carbon dioxide happens in the 
transformation of pyruvic acid into 
acetyl-CoA (two molecules) and in the 
Krebs cycle (four molecules). For each 
glucose molecule, six carbon dioxide 
molecules are made.
45. How is carbon dioxide 
released by cellular 
respiration transported from 
the tissues to be eliminated 
through the lungs?
In vertebrates almost 70% of the 
carbon dioxide is transported by the 
blood in the form of bicarbonate, 25% 
bound to hemoglobin and 5% dissolved 
in the plasma.
46. What is the difference 
between double closed 
circulation and simple closed 
circulation?
Double closed circulation, or closed 
circulation, is that in which the blood 
circulates through two associated and 
parallel vascular systems: one that 
carries blood to and takes blood from 
the peripheral tissues (the systemic 
circulation) and the other that carries 
blood to and takes blood from the 
tissues that perform gas exchange with 
the environment, e.g, the lungs 
(pulmonary circulation). Double 
circulation occurs in amphibians, 
reptiles, birds and mammals.
Simple closed circulation, or simple 
circulation, is the one in which the 
tissues that perform gas exchange are 
associated in series with the systemic 
circulation, as in fishes.
47. How many chambers does 
the fish heart have?
The fish heart is a tube made of two 
consecutive chambers: one atrium and 
one ventricle.
48. Does the fish heart pump 
venous or arterial blood?
The venous blood coming from the 
tissues enters the atrium and passes to 
the ventricle that then pumps the blood 
towards the gills. After oxygenation in 
the gills the arterial blood goes to the 
tissues. So the fish heart pumps venous 
blood.
49. Why is the fish circulation 
classified as a simple and 
complete circulation?
Complete circulation is that in which 
there is no mixture of venous blood and 
arterial blood. Simple circulation is that 
in which the blood circulates only in one 
circuit (as opposed to the double 
circulation that have two circuits, the 
systemic circulation and the pulmonary

circulation). In fishes the circulatory 
system is simple and complete.
50. How many heart chambers 
does the amphibian heart 
have?
The amphibian heart has three heart 
chambers: two atria and one ventricle.
51. Why can the amphibian 
circulation be classified as 
double and incomplete?
The amphibian circulation is double 
because it is composed of systemic and 
pulmonary circulations: respectively, 
heart-tissues-heart and heart-lungs-
heart. Since amphibians have only one 
ventricle in the heart, venous blood 
taken from the tissues and arterial 
blood coming from the lungs are mixed 
in the ventricle that then pumps the 
mixture back to the systemic and to the 
pulmonary circulations. The amphibian 
circulation is classified as incomplete 
because venous and arterial blood mix 
in the circuit.
The blood oxygenation in amphibians 
occurs also in the systemic circulation 
since their skin is a gas exchange 
organ.
52. What is the difference 
between the amphibian heart 
and the reptile heart?
The reptiles have double and incomplete 
circulation too, three heart chambers 
(two atria and one ventricle). The reptile 
heart however presents the beginning of 
a ventricular septation that partially 
separates a right and left region of the 
chamber. With the partial ventricular 
septation the mixture of arterial with 
venous blood in the reptile heart is less 
than in amphibians.
53. How many chambers do 
the bird heart and the 
mammalian heart have? 
Concerning temperature 
maintenance what is the 
advantage of the double and 
complete circulation of these 
animals?
The bird and the mammalian hearts are 
divided into four chambers: right 
atrium, right ventricle, left atrium and 
left ventricle.
Birds and mammals are homeothermic, 
i.e., they control their body 
temperature. The four-chambered heart 
and the double circulation provide the 
supply of more oxygenated blood to the 
tissues making possible a higher 
metabolic rate (mainly cellular 
respiration rate). Part of the energy 
produced by the cellular respiration is 
used to maintain the body temperature.

54. Concerning the mixture of 
arterial with venous blood 
what is the difference 
between the human fetal 
circulation and the adult 
circulation?
In the human fetal circulation there are 
two communications between arterial 
and venous blood characterizing an 
incomplete circulation. One of them is 
the oval foramen, an opening between 
the right and the left atria of the fetal 
heart. The other is the arterial duct, a 
short vessel connecting the pulmonary 
artery to the aorta. These 
communications close a few days after 
birth and so they are not present in the 
adult heart.
55. How is heart contraction 
triggered?
Heart contraction is independent from 
neuronal stimulus (although it can be 
modulated by the autonomous nervous 
system). In the heart there are 
pacemaker cells that trigger by 
themselves the action potentials that 
begin the muscle contraction. These 
cells are concentrated at two special 
points of the heart: the sinoatrial node 
(SA node) located in the superior 
portion of the right atrium and the 
atrioventricular node (AV node) located 
near the interatrial septum.
The action potentials generated by 
depolarization of the SA node cells 
propagate cell to cell throughout the 
atria producing the atrial contraction. 
The atrial depolarization also propagates 
to the AV node that then transmits the 
electric impulse to the ventricles 
through specialized conduction bundles 
of the interventricular septum (the 
bundle of His) and then to the Purkinje 
fibers of the ventricle walls causing 
ventricular contraction. (The atrial 
contraction precedes the ventricular 
contraction for blood to fill the ventricles 
before the ventricular contraction.)
The repolarization of the SA node makes 
the atria relax and then the ventricles 
relax too.

Biology Questions and Answers
Excretory System
1. What is excretion?
Excretion in Physiology is the process of 
elimination of metabolic wastes and 
other toxic substances from the body.
2. What are nitrogen wastes?
Nitrogen wastes are residuals derived 
from the degradation of proteins. They 
are made from chemical transformation 
of the amine group of amino acid 
molecules.
3. What are the three main 
types of nitrogen wastes 
excreted by living beings?
The main nitrogen wastes excreted by 
living beings are ammonia, uric acid and 
urea. Living beings that secrete 
ammonia are known as ammoniotelic. 
Creatures that secrete uric acid are 
known as uricotelic. Organisms that 
secrete urea are called ureotelic.
4. Why are most ammoniotelic 
beings aquatic animals?
Aquatic animals, like crustaceans, bony 
fishes and amphibian larvae, generally 
are ammoniotelic since ammonia 
diffuses more easily through 
membranes and it is more water-soluble 
than the other nitrogen wastes. 
Ammonia is still the most energetically 
economical nitrogen waste to be 
synthesized.
5. Why after the passage of 
animals from the aquatic to 
the terrestrial habitat does the 
abandonment of the 
ammoniotelic excretion occur?
Ammonia is a highly toxic molecule if 
not diluted and quickly excreted out of 
the body. For this reason the 
ammoniotelic excretion was abandoned 
in terrestrial habitats because the 
availability of water for dilution is 
reduced in this medium and wastes 
cannot be excreted so promptly to the 
exterior.
6. Comparing toxicity and the 
need for dilution in water how 
different are the ureotelic and 
the uricotelic excretions? 
What are some examples of 
animals that present these 
respective types of excretion?
Urea is more water-soluble than uric 
acid (an almost insoluble substance). 
Urea is also more toxic. Both however 
are less toxic than ammonia.
Some invertebrates, chondrichthian 
fishes, adult amphibians and mammals 
are ureotelic. Reptiles, birds and most 
arthropods are uricotelic.

Biology Questions and Answers
7. What is the nitrogen waste 
in amphibian larvae and in the 
adult animal?
Since amphibian larvae are aquatic they 
excrete ammonia. The terrestrial adult 
excretes urea.
8. Why is the uricotelic 
excretion essential for avian 
and reptile embryos?
In reptiles and birds the excretory 
system is uricotelic since uric acid is 
insoluble, less toxic and suitable to be 
stored within the eggs where their 
embryos develop.
9. How do embryos of 
placental mammals excrete 
nitrogen wastes?
Placental animals, including embryos, 
excrete urea. In the adult placental 
mammal urea is excreted through the 
urine. In embryos the molecule passes 
to the mother’s blood through the 
placenta and it is excreted in the 
mother’s urine.
10. What is the main nitrogen 
waste of humans?
Human beings excrete mainly urea 
eliminated with the urine.
11. How is urea formed in the 
human body?
Urea is a product of the degradation of 
amino acids. In the process amino acids 
lose their amine group which is then 
transformed into ammonia. In the liver 
ammonia reacts with carbon dioxide to 
form urea and water, a process called 
ureogenesis.
In the intermediary reactions of the 
ureogenesis a molecule of ornithine is 
consumed and another is produced. For 
this reason ureogenesis is also known 
as the ornithine cycle.
12. Which are the organs of 
the excretory system?
The excretory system is formed of 
kidneys (two), ureters (two), bladder 
and urethra.
13. What are the vessels that 
carry blood to the kidneys? Is 
this blood arterial or venous?
The arterial vessels that carry blood to 
be filtrated by the kidneys are the renal 
arteries. The renal arteries are 
ramifications of the aorta and so the 
blood filtered by the kidneys is arterial 
(oxygen-rich) blood.
14. Which are the vessels that 
drain filtered blood from the 
kidneys?

Buyer: Victoria Proctor (vicproc6@gmail.com)
Transaction ID: 4KS71350WY6468607

Biology Questions and Answers
The venous vessels that collect the 
blood filtered by the kidneys are the 
renal veins. The renal veins carry the 
blood that has been reabsorbed in the 
nephron tubules.
15. What is the functional 
unity of the kidneys?
The functional (filtering) unity of the 
kidneys is the nephron. A nephron is 
made of afferent arteriole, efferent 
arteriole, glomerulus, Bowman's 
capsule, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, 
distal tubule and collecting duct.
In each kidney there are about one 
million nephrons.
16. What are the three main 
renal processes that combined 
produce urine?
Urine is made by the occurrence of 
three processes in the nephron: 
glomerular filtration, tubular resorption 
and tubular secretion.
In the nephron the blood carried by the 
afferent arteriole enters the glomerular 
capillary network where it is filtered. 
The filtration implies that part of the 
blood returns to the circulation through 
the efferent arteriole and the other part, 
known as the glomerular filtrate, enters 
the proximal tubule of the nephron. In 
the nephron tubules (also known as 
convoluted tubules) substances of the 
glomerular filtrate like water, ions and 
small organic molecules are resorbed by 
the cells of the tubule wall and gain 
again the circulation. These cells also 
secrete other substances inside the 
tubules. The urine is formed of not 
resorbed filtered substances and of 
secreted (by the tubules) substances. 
Urine is drained by the collecting ducts 
to the ureter of each kidney, then it 
enters the bladder and later it is 
discharged through the urethra.
The nephron tubules are surrounded by 
an extensive capillary network that 
collects resorbed substances and 
provides others to be secreted.
17. What is the main 
transformation presented by 
the glomerular filtrate in 
comparison to the blood?
Glomerular filtrate is the name given to 
the plasma after it has passed the 
glomerulus and entered the Bowman’s 
capsule. The glomerular filtrate has a 
different composition compared to urine 
since the fluid has not yet undergone 
tubular resorption and secretion.
The main difference between the blood 
and the glomerular filtrate is that in the 
latter the amount of proteins is at a 
minimum and there are no cells or blood 
platelets.
18. What is proteinuria? Why 
is proteinuria a sign of 
glomerular renal injury?
Proteinuria means losing of proteins 
through urine. Under normal conditions 
proteins are too big to be filtered by the 
glomerulus and they are practically

absent in the urine (the few filtered 
proteins may also be resorbed in the 
nephron tubules). Proteinuria is an 
indication that a more than expected 
amount of proteins is passing the 
glomerulus suggesting glomerular 
disease, e.g., in diabetic nephropathy.
The glomerulus also blocks the passage 
of blood cells and platelets (hematuria is 
often a sign of urinary disease although 
less specific of kidneys since the blood 
may come from the lower parts of the 
excretory tract).
19. Where does most of the 
water resorbed after 
glomerular filtration go? What 
are the other substances 
resorbed by the nephron 
tubules?
Only 0.5 to 1% of the glomerular filtrate 
is eliminated as urine. The remaining 
volume, containing mainly metabolic 
ions, glucose, amino acids and water, is 
resorbed through the nephron tubules 
(by means of active or passive 
transport) and gains the blood 
circulation again.
The convolute tubules of the nephron 
are responsible for the resorption of 
substances.
20. Why do cells of the 
nephron tubules present a 
great amount of 
mitochondria?
The cells of the tubule wall have high 
number of mitochondria because many 
substances are resorbed or secreted 
through them by means of active 
transport (a process that spends 
energy). Therefore many mitochondria 
are necessary for the energetic supply 
(ATP supply) of this type of transport.
21. What is tubular secretion? 
What are some examples of 
substances secreted through 
the renal tubules?
Tubular secretion is the passage of 
substances from the blood capillaries 
that surround the nephron tubules to 
the tubular lumen for these substances 
to be excreted with urine. Ammonia, 
uric acid, potassium, bicarbonate and 
hydrogen ions, metabolic acids and 
bases, various ingested drugs 
(medicines) and other substances are 
secreted by the nephron tubules.
22. In which nephron portion 
does the regulation of acidity 
and alkalinity of the plasma 
occur?
The regulation of the acid-basic 
equilibrium of the body is done by the 
kidneys and depends upon the tubular 
resorption and secretion.

Biology Questions and Answers
23. How do kidneys 
participate in the regulation of 
the acid-basic equilibrium of 
the body? How are alkalosis 
and acidosis respectively 
corrected by the kidneys?
Kidneys can regulate the acidity or 
alkalinity of the plasma varying the 
excretion of hydrogen and bicarbonate 
ions.
In alkalosis (abnormally high level of 
the plasma pH) the kidneys excrete 
more bicarbonate and the equilibrium of 
formation of bicarbonate from water 
and carbon dioxide shifts towards 
formation of more hydrogen ions and 
bicarbonate and then the plasma pH is 
lowered. When the body undergoes 
acidosis (abnormal low level of the 
plasma pH) the kidneys excrete more 
hydrogen ions and retain more 
bicarbonate thus the equilibrium of 
formation of bicarbonate from water 
and carbon dioxide shifts towards more 
hydrogen consumption and the plasma 
pH is increased.
24. How do kidneys 
participate in the blood 
volume control? How is the 
blood volume of the body 
related to the arterial 
pressure?
The kidneys and the hormones that act 
upon them are the main physiological 
regulators of the total blood volume of 
the body. As more water is resorbed in 
the nephron tubules the more the blood 
volume increases; as more water is 
excreted in urine the more the blood 
volume lowers.
The blood volume in its turn has a direct 
relation to blood pressure. The blood 
pressure increases when the blood 
volume increases and it lowers when 
the blood volume lowers. That is the 
reason why one of the main groups of 
antihypertensive drugs is the diuretics. 
Doctors often prescribe diuretics for the 
hypertensive patients to excrete more 
water and thus lower their blood 
pressure.
25. Which are the three 
hormones that participate in 
the regulation of the renal 
function?
Antidiuretic hormone (or ADH, or 
vasopressin), aldosterone and atrial 
natriuretic factor (or ANF) are hormones 
that participate in the regulation of the 
excretory system.
26. What is the function of the 
antidiuretic hormone? Where 
is it made and which are the 
stimuli that increase or reduce 
its secretion?
The antidiuretic hormone is secreted by 
the hypophysis (also known as pituitary) 
and it acts in the nephron tubules 
increasing the resorption of water. 
When the body needs to retain water, 
for example, in cases of blood loss and 
abrupt blood pressure lowering or in 
cases of abnormally high blood

Biology Questions and Answers
osmolarity, there is stimulus for ADH 
secretion.
When the body has an excess of water, 
as in cases of excessive ingestion or in 
abnormally low blood osmolarity, the 
secretion of ADH is blocked and the 
diuresis increases. ADH is also known as 
vasopressin since it increases the blood 
volume and thus heightens the blood 
pressure.
27. Why does the ingestion of 
alcohol increase diuresis?
Alcohol inhibits the secretion of ADH 
(antidiuretic hormone) by the pituitary. 
That is why when it is drunk to excess 
the person urinates too much.
28. How does aldosterone act 
and where is it produced?
Aldosterone is a hormone that acts upon 
the nephron tubules stimulating the 
resorption of sodium. Therefore it 
contributes to the increase of the blood 
osmolarity and consequently to the 
increase of the blood pressure.
Aldosterone is made by the adrenals, 
glands located over the superior portion 
of the kidneys.
29. What is an evolutionary 
explanatory hypothesis for the 
secretion by the heart of a 
hormone that regulates the 
renal function? Which is that 
hormone?
The renal regulator hormone secreted 
by the heart is the atrial natriuretic 
factor (or ANF). The ANF increases the 
excretion of sodium in the nephron 
tubules causing less resorption of water, 
more urinary volume, and thus lowering 
the blood pressure. The atrial natriuretic 
factor is secreted when there is an 
increase of the length of the heart 
muscle fibers in response to high blood 
pressure. The ANF is a natural 
antihypertensive substance. Since the 
health of the heart depends largely 
upon the stability of the normal blood 
pressure the evolution should have 
preserved the atrial natriuretic factor to 
allow information from the heart to be 
an additional mechanism for the renal 
control of the blood pressure.
30. What is hemodialysis?
Hemodialysis is the artificial blood 
filtration made by specific machines in 
substitution of the kidneys. 
Hemodialysis may be necessary in 
patients suffering from diseases that 
cause renal failure, like diabetic renal 
complications, lupic renal complications 
and others. During hemodialysis the 
blood of the patient is deviated to the 
filtering machine and after the filtration 
it returns to the body. 
Hemodialysis is generally done two, 
three or more times a week in a process

Biology Questions and Answers
Epithelia
1. What is the function of the 
skin in humans?
The skin is the external covering of the 
body. In humans its main functions are 
protection, perception of information 
from the environment, control of the 
body temperature and secretion of 
substances.
2. What are the tissues that 
form the skin in vertebrates?
The skin of vertebrates is made of 
epidermis, an external layer of epithelial 
tissue, and dermis, a layer of connective 
tissue under the epidermis. One can cite 
also the hypodermis, a layer of adipose 
tissue under the dermis.
Skin annexes may exist in some phyla 
and classes, like hair, sweat glands and 
sebaceous glands.
3. Besides the skin what are 
the other coverings of the 
body?
Besides the skin there are other 
covering tissues made of epithelium 
over other tissue layers. They are the 
tissues that cover the internal surfaces 
of hollow organs, like the organs of the 
digestive tube, the airway, the renal 
tubules, the ureters, the bladder, the 
urethra and the blood vessels. The 
glands and the serous membranes are 
made of epithelial tissue too.
4. What are some functions of 
the epithelium?
The epithelial tissues can perform 
covering, impermeability and protection 
against the environment, for example, 
in the skin, resorption, as in the guts 
and renal tubules, gas exchange, for 
example, the amphibian skin, thermal 
regulation, like sweating, secretion of 
substances, as in the epithelium of 
glands. In some animals the skin also 
has the important function of 
camouflage and mimicry .
5. What is the typical feature 
of the epithelia? How different 
is it from the connective 
tissue?
The typical feature of the epithelium is 
the absence or almost absence of space 
between cells. The epithelial cells are 
compactly positioned side-by-side with 
the help of specialized structures for cell 
adhesion like desmosomes and 
interdigitations. This feature relates to 
the fact that these tissues are generally 
exposed to an exterior surround and so 
they need more resistance and 
impermeability against the entrance of 
strange material into the body.
The connective tissue presents opposite 
features due to its filling function. It has 
much interstitial material (the matrix) 
and relatively large space between cells.

6. What are the specialized 
structures that help the 
adhesion between cells?
The structures responsible for the union 
of the epithelial cells are called cell 
junctions. The main cell junctions are 
interdigitations, desmosomes, zonula 
adherens (adherens junction), tight 
junctions (zonula occludens) and gap 
junctions.
7. Is the epithelium 
vascularized? How do 
nutrients and oxygen reach 
the epithelium? Why is this 
feature an important 
evolutionary acquisition?
Epithelia are not vascularized 
(capillaries do not directly reach their 
cells). The epithelium exchanges 
substances by diffusion with the 
connective tissue situated under it.
Since the epithelia are not vascularized 
minuscule skin injuries or scratches that 
happen all the time do not trigger 
bleeding and do not expose the blood to 
contamination from external agents. 
This is an important protective strategy 
discovered by evolution.
8. How are the epithelial 
tissues classified?
The epithelial tissues are classified 
according to the shape of the cells that 
form it (epithelial cells may be cuboidal, 
columnar, or squamous) and according 
to the number of layers in which those 
cells are placed in the tissue (into 
simple or stratified).
The main types of epithelial tissues are 
simple cuboidal, simple columnar, 
simple squamous, stratified squamous 
and pseudostratified columnar 
(resembling more than one layer but 
actually having only one). There are 
also stratified cuboidal and stratified 
columnar epithelia (rare).
9. How different is the simple 
cuboidal epithelium from the 
columnar epithelium? Where 
can these epithelia be found in 
the human body?
The simple cuboidal epithelium is made 
of a single layer of cuboidal epithelial 
cells. The simple columnar epithelium is 
made of a single layer of prismatic cells.
The simple cuboidal epithelium can be 
found, for example, in the renal tubules 
and in the walls of the thyroid follicles. 
The simple columnar is the epithelium 
that covers internally the intestines, the 
stomach and the gallbladder, for 
example.
10. How different is the simple 
squamous epithelium from the 
stratified squamous 
epithelium? Where can these 
epithelia be found in the 
human body?
The simple squamous epithelium is 
made of a single layer of flat 
(squamous) cells. The stratified 
www.biology-questions-and-answers.com

squamous epithelium is made of the 
same type of flat cells placed in several 
superimposed layers.
The simple squamous epithelium is 
found in the pulmonary alveoli. The 
stratified squamous epithelium can be 
found in the moist mucosae, like the 
mucosae of the mouth, esophagus and 
vagina, and it is the epithelium of the 
skin.
11. What is the function of 
keratin in the epidermis?
The epidermis is the outer layer of the 
skin made of epithelial tissue. In the 
epidermis there are keratin-secreting 
cells (keratinocytes). Keratin is an 
insoluble protein that impregnates the 
surface of the skin providing protection 
and impermeability. In mammals 
keratin also forms the hairs.
The keratinized cells of the skin surface 
form the corneal layer. These cells die 
and are continuously replaced by 
others.
12. How different is the fish 
epidermis from the amphibian 
epidermis?
The fish epidermis is very thin and 
contains mucus-secreting cells. The fish 
skin does not present keratin. The 
mucus has a protective function and it 
also helps the sliding of the animal 
under water. (The fish scales originate 
from the dermis and not from the 
epidermis.)
In amphibians there is already a slight 
keratinization of the skin, probably an 
additional adaptation to the terrestrial 
environment. Amphibians have smooth 
and wet epidermis without scales. These 
features facilitate their cutaneous 
respiration.
13. Which are the glands 
present in the epidermis of 
mammals, birds and reptiles?
In the epidermis of birds and reptiles 
there are practically no glands. In 
mammals there are sweat glands and 
sebaceous glands.
14. What are melanocytes?
Melanocytes are epithelial cells of the 
skin specialized in secretion of melanin. 
Melanin is a pigment that besides 
coloring the skin, the iris of the eye and 
the hair, also works as a filter against 
the ultraviolet radiation of the sun thus 
protecting the body against the harmful 
effects of this radiation (mainly burns 
and carcinogenic mutations).
Melanocytes are the cells affected in one 
of the more deadly skin cancers: 
melanoma.

Musculoskeletal 
System
1. Which are the organs that 
are part of the 
musculoskeletal system?
The main organs and tissues that are 
part of the musculoskeletal system in 
humans are the cartilages, the bones 
and the muscles.
2. What are the functions of 
the musculoskeletal system?
The musculoskeletal system has the 
functions of supporting and protecting 
organs, maintenance of the body spatial 
conformation, motion of organs, limbs 
and bodily portions and nutrient storage 
(glycogen in muscles, calcium and 
phosphorus in bones).
3. Which type of tissue are the 
cartilaginous and the osseous 
tissue?
The cartilaginous and the osseous 
tissues are considered connective 
tissues since they are tissues in which 
the cells are relatively distant from 
others with a great amount of 
extracellular matrix in the interstitial 
space.
4. What are the cells that form 
the cartilaginous tissue?
The main cells of the cartilages are the 
chondrocytes, originated from the 
chondroblasts that secrete the 
intersticial matrix. There are also 
chondroclasts, cells with many 
lisosomes and responsible for the 
digestion and remodelation of the 
cartilaginous matrix.
5. What is the constitution of 
the cartilaginous matrix?
The cartilaginous matrix is made of 
collagen fibers, mainly collagen type II, 
and of proteoglycans, proteins 
associated to glycosaminoglycans, 
chiefly hyaluronic acid. The 
proteoglycans provide the typical 
rigidity of the cartilages.
6. What are some functions of 
the cartilages in the human 
body?
Cartilages are responsible for the 
structural support of the nose and ears. 
The trachea and the bronchi are also 
organs with cartilaginous structures that 
prevent the closing of these tubes. In 
joints there are cartilages that cover the 
bones providing a smooth surface to 
reduce the friction of the joint 
movement. In the formation of bones 
the cartilages act as a mold and they 
are gradually substituted by the osseous 
tissue.

7. What are the three main 
cell types that form the 
osseous tissue? What are their 
functions?
The three main cell types of the osseous 
tissue are the osteoblasts, the 
osteocytes and the osteoclasts.
Osteoblasts are known as bone-forming 
cells since they are the cells that secrete 
the proteinaceous part of the bone 
matrix (collagen, glycoproteins and 
proteoglycans). The bone matrix is the 
intercellular space where the mineral 
substances of the bones are deposited.
Osteocytes are differentiated mature 
osteoblasts formed after these cells are 
completely surrounded by the bone 
matrix. Osteocytes have the function of 
supporting the tissue.
Osteoclasts are the giant multinucleate 
cells that remodelate the osseous 
tissue. They are originated from 
monocytes and they contain many 
lisosomes. Osteoblasts secrete enzymes 
that digest the osseous matrix creating 
canals throughout the tissue.
8. What is the bone matrix? 
What are its main 
components?
Bone matrix is the content that fills the 
intercellular space of the osseous tissue. 
The bone matrix is made of mineral 
substances (about 5%), mainly 
phosphorus and calcium salts, and 
organic substances (95%), mainly 
collagen, glycoproteins and 
proteoglycans.
9. What are the Haversian 
canals and the Volkmann’s 
canals of the bones? Is the 
osseous tissue vascularized?
The Haversian canals are longitudinal 
canals present in the osseous tissue 
within which blood vessels and nerves 
pass. The osseous tissue distributes 
itself in a concentric manner around 
these canals. The Volkmann’s canals are 
communications between the Harvesian 
canals.
The osseous tissue is highly 
vascularized in its interior.
10. What are the functions of 
the osseous tissue?
The main functions of the osseous tissue 
are: to provide structural rigidity to the 
body and to delineate the spatial 
positioning of the other tissues and 
organs; to support the body weight; to 
serve as a site for mineral storage, 
mainly of calcium and phosphorus; to 
form protective structures for important 
organs like the brain, the spinal cord, 
the heart and the lungs; to work as a 
lever and support for the muscles, 
providing movement; to contain the 
bone marrow where hematopoiesis 
occurs.
11. What are the flat bones 
and the long bones?
The main bones of the body may be 
classified as flat or long bones (there 
are bones not classified into these

categories). Examples of flat bones are 
the skull, the ribs, the hipbones, the 
scapulae and the sternum. Examples of 
long bones are the humerus, the radius, 
the ulna, the femur, the tibia and the 
fibula.
12. What are the types of 
muscle tissues? What are the 
morphological features that 
differentiate those types?
There are three types of muscle tissue: 
the skeletal striated muscle tissue, the 
cardiac striated muscle tissue and the 
smooth muscle tissue.
The striated muscles present under 
microscopic view transversal stripes and 
their fibers (cells) are multinucleate (in 
the skeletal) or may have more than 
one nucleus (in the cardiac). The 
smooth muscle does not present 
transversal stripes and it has spindle-
shaped fibers each with only one 
nucleus.
13. Which is the type of 
muscle tissue that moves the 
bones?
The bones are moved by the skeletal 
striated muscles. These muscles are 
voluntary (controlled by volition).
14. Which is the type of 
muscle tissue that contracts 
and relaxes the heart 
chambers?
The myocardium of the heart is made of 
cardiac striated muscle tissue.
15. Which is the type of 
muscle tissue that performs 
the peristaltic movements of 
the intestines?
The smooth muscle tissue is responsible 
for the peristaltic movements of the 
intestines. The smooth muscles are not 
controlled by volition.
16. Which is the type of 
muscle tissue that helps to 
push the food down through 
the esophagus?
The esophageal wall in its superior 
portion is made of skeletal striated 
muscle. The inferior portion is made of 
smooth muscle. In the intermediate 
portion there are skeletal striated and 
smooth muscles. All of these muscles 
are important to push the food down 
towards the stomach.
17. How is the striped pattern 
of the striated muscle cells 
formed?
The functional units of the muscle fibers 
are the sarcomeres. Within the

Biology Questions and Answers
sarcomeres blocks of actin and myosin 
molecules are posed in organized 
manner. The sarcomeres align in 
sequence forming myofibrils that are 
longitudinally placed in the cytoplasm of 
the muscle fibers (cells). The grouping 
of consecutive blocks of actin and 
myosin in parallel filaments creates the 
striped pattern of the striated muscle 
tissue seen under the microscope.
18. What are sarcomeres?
Sarcomeres are the contractile units of 
the muscle tissue formed of alternating 
actin blocks (thin filaments) and myosin 
blocks (thick filaments). Several 
sarcomeres placed in linear sequence 
form a myofibril. Therefore one muscle 
fiber (cell) has many myofibrils made of 
sacomeres.
The compartments where myofibrils are 
inserted are delimited by an excitable 
membrane known as sarcolemma. The 
sarcolemma is the plasma membrane of 
the muscle cell.
19. What are the main 
proteins that constitute the 
sarcomere? What is the 
function of those molecules in 
the muscle cells?
In the sarcomere there are organized 
actin and myosin blocks. Troponin and 
tropomyosin also appear associated to 
actin.
The actin molecules when activated by 
calcium ions liberated in the proximities 
of the sarcomere are pulled by myosin 
molecules. This interaction between 
actin and myosin shortens the myofibrils 
originating the phenomenon of muscle 
contraction.
20. What are the positions of 
actin and myosin molecules in 
the sarcomere before and 
during the muscle 
contraction?
Schematically actin filaments attached 
perpendicularly to both sarcomere 
extremities (longitudinal sides) make 
contact with myosin filaments 
positioned in the middle of the 
sarcomere and in parallel to the actin 
filaments.
Before the contraction the sarcomeres 
are extended (relaxed) since the contact 
between actin and myosin filaments is 
only made by their extremities. During 
contraction actin filaments slide along 
the myosin filaments and the 
sarcomeres shorten.
21. How do calcium ions 
participate in muscle 
contraction? Why do both 
muscle contraction and 
muscle relaxation spend 
energy?
In the muscle cells calcium ions are 
stored within the sarcoplasmic 
reticulum. When a motor neuron emits 
stimulus for the muscle contraction 
neurotransmitters called acetylcholine 
are released in the neuromuscular 
junction and the sarcolemma is excited.

Biology Questions and Answers
The excitation is conduced to the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum that then 
realeases calcium ions into the 
sarcomeres.
In the sarcomeres the calcium ions bind 
to troponin molecules associated to 
actin activating myosin binding sites of 
actin. The myosin, then able to bind to 
actin, pulls this protein and the 
sarcomere shortens. The summation of 
simultaneous contraction of sarcomeres 
and myofibrils constitutes the muscle 
contraction. During muscle relaxation 
the calcium ions return back to the 
sarcoplasmic reticulum.
For myosin to bind to actin, and thus for 
the contraction to occur, hydrolysis of 
one ATP molecule is necessary. During 
relaxation the return of calcium ions to 
the sarcoplasmic reticulum is an active 
process that spends ATP too. So both 
muscle contraction and relaxation are 
energy-spending processes.
22. What is myoglobin? What 
is the function of this 
molecule in the muscle tissue?
Myoglobin is a pigment similar to 
hemoglobin and present in muscle 
fibers. Myoglobin has a great affinity for 
oxygen. It keeps oxygen bound and 
releases the gas under strenuous 
muscle work. So myoglobin acts as an 
oxygen reserve for the muscle cell.
23. How does phosphocreatine 
act in the muscle contraction 
and relaxation?
Phosphocreatine is the main means of 
energy storage of the muscle cells.
During relaxed periods ATP molecules 
made by the aerobic cellular respiration 
transfer highly energized phosphate 
groups to creatine forming 
phosphocreatine. In exercise periods 
phosphocreatine and ADP resynthesize 
ATP to dispose energy for the muscle 
contraction.
24. What happens when the 
oxygen supply is insufficient 
to maintain aerobic cellular 
respiration during muscle 
exercise?
If oxygen from hemoglobin or 
myoglobin is not enough for the energy 
supply of the muscle cell the cell then 
begins to do lactic fermentation in an 
attempt to compensate the deficiency.
The lactic fermentation releases lactic 
acid and this substance causes muscle 
fatigue and predisposes the muscles to 
cramps.
25. What is the 
neurotransmitter of the 
neuromuscular junction? How 
does the nervous system 
trigger muscle contraction?
The nervous cells that trigger the 
muscle contraction are the motor 
neurons. The neurotransmitter of the 
motor neurons is acetylcholine. When a 
motor neuron is excited the depolarizing 
current flows along the membrane of its

Biology Questions and Answers
axon until reaching the synapse at the 
neuromuscular junction (the neural 
impulse passage zone between the axon 
extremity and the sarcolemma). Near 
the axonal extremity the depolarization 
allows the entrance of calcium ions into 
the axon (note that calcium also has a 
relevant role here). The calcium ions 
stimulate the neuron to release 
acetylcholine in the synapse.
Acetylcholine then binds to special 
receptors in the outer surface of the 
sarcolemma, the permeability of this 
membrane is altered and an action 
potential is created. The depolarization 
is then conduced along the sarcolemma 
to the sarcoplasmic reticulum that thus 
releases calcium ions for the sarcomere 
contraction.
26. To increase the strength of 
the muscle work is the muscle 
contraction intensely 
increased?
An increase in the strength of the 
muscle work is not achieved by increase 
in the intensity of the stimulation of 
each muscle fiber. The muscle fiber 
obeys an all-or-nothing rule, i.e., its 
contraction strength is only one and 
cannot be increased.
When the body needs to increase the 
strength of the muscle work a 
phenomenon known as spatial 
summation occurs: new muscle fibers 
are recruited in addition to the fibers 
already in action. So the strength of the 
muscle contraction increases only when 
the number of active muscle cells 
increases.
27. What is the difference 
between spatial summation 
and temporal summation of 
muscle fibers? What is tetany?
Spatial summation is the recruiting of 
new muscle fibers to increase the 
muscle strength. Temporal summation 
occurs when a muscle fiber is 
continuously stimulated to contract 
without being able to conclude 
relaxation.
The permanence of a muscle fiber under 
a continuous state of contraction by 
temporal summation is known as tetany 
(e.g., the clinical condition of patients 
contaminated by the toxin of the 
tetanus bacteria). Tetany ends when all 
available energy for contraction is spent 
or when the stimulus ceases.

Biology Questions and Answers
Nervous System
1. What are the physiological 
systems known as integrative 
systems? Why is this 
designation justified?
The integrative systems are the nervous 
system and the endocrine system. The 
designation is justified since both 
systems control and regulate biological 
functions and act at distance receiving 
information from organs and tissues and 
sending effector commands (nervous 
impulses or hormones) to organs and 
tissues thus integrating the body.
2. Which are the structures 
that are part of the nervous 
system?
The structures that form the nervous 
system can be divided into the central 
nervous system (CNS) and the 
peripheral nervous system (PNS).
The organs of the CNS are the brain 
(cerebrum, brainstem and cerebellum) 
and spinal cord. The PNS is made of 
nerves and neural ganglia. Besides 
these organs the meninges (dura-
mater, arachnoid and pia-mater) are 
part of the nervous system too since 
they cover and protect the encephalon 
and the spinal cord.
3. Which are the main cells of 
the nervous system?
The main cells of the nervous system 
are the neurons. Besides the neurons 
the nervous system is also constituted 
of glial cells.
4. What are the functional 
differences between neurons 
and glial cells?
Glial cells and neurons are the cells that 
form the nervous system. Neurons are 
cells that have the function of receiving 
and transmitting the neural impulses 
and glial cells (astrocytes, 
microgliacytes, ependymal cells and 
oligodendrocytes) are the cells that 
support, feed and insulate (electrically) 
the neurons. The Schwann cells that 
produce the myelin sheath of the 
peripheral nervous system can also be 
considered glial cells.
5. What are the three main 
parts into which a neuron can 
be divided? What are their 
respective functions?
The three mains parts into which a 
neuron can be didactically divided are: 
dendrites, cell body and axon.
Dendrites are projections of the plasma 
membrane that receive the neural 
impulse from other neurons. The cell 
body is where the nucleus and the main 
cellular organelles are located. Axon is 
the long membrane projection that

transmits the neural impulse at distance 
to other neurons, to muscle cells and to 
other effector cells.
6. What is the name of the 
terminal portion of the axon?
The terminal portion of the axon is 
called presynaptic membrane. Through 
this membrane neurotransmitters are 
released into the synaptic junction.
7. What are synapses?
Synapses are the structures that 
transmit the neural impulse between 
two neurons.
When the electric impulse arrives the 
presynaptic membrane of the axon 
releases neurotransmitters that bind to 
postsynaptic receptors of the dendrites 
of the next cell. The activated state of 
these receptors alters the permeability 
of the dendritic membrane and the 
electric depolarization propagates along 
the neuron plasma membrane to its 
axon.
8. What is an example of a 
situation in which the neuron 
cell body is located in a part of 
the body and its axonal 
terminal portion is in another 
distant part of the body? Why 
does this happen?
Most of the neurons are situated within 
the brain and the spinal cord (central 
nervous system) in places known as 
neural nuclei. Neural ganglia, or simply 
ganglia, are structures of the peripheral 
nervous system located beside the 
spinal column or near some organs 
where neuron cell bodies are also 
located.
Neurons situated at specific points can 
present distant axonal terminations and 
they also can receive impulses from 
axons of distant neurons. The inferior 
motor neurons situated in the spinal 
cord are examples since their axons can 
transmit information to the extremities 
of the inferior limbs triggering 
contractions of the foot.
9. According to the function of 
the transmitted neural 
impulse which are the types of 
neurons? How different are 
the concepts of afference and 
efference of the neural 
impulse transmission?
There are three types of neurons: 
afferent neurons, efferent neurons and 
interneurons. Afferent neurons are 
those that only transmit sensory 
information from the tissues to neural 
nuclei and ganglia (where they make 
connection with interneurons or effector 
neurons). Efferent neurons are those 
that transmit commands to tasks 
performed in several parts of the body. 
Interneurons, also known as association 
neurons or relay neurons, serve as 
connection between two other neurons.
Afference is the conduction of sensory 
impulses and efference is the 
conduction of effector impulses

(impulses that command some body 
action).
10. What are nerves?
Axons extend throughout the body 
inside nerves. Nerves are axon-
containing structures presenting many 
axons and covered by connective tissue. 
The nerves connect neural nuclei and 
ganglia with the tissues.
Nerves may contain only sensory axons 
(sensory nerves), only motor axons 
(motor neurons) or both types of axons 
(mixed nerves).
11. What are ganglia?
Ganglia (singular ganglion), or neural 
ganglia, are structures located outside 
the central nervous system (for 
example, beside the spinal column or 
near viscera) made of concentration of 
neuron bodies.
Examples of neural ganglia are the 
ganglia that concentrate cell bodies of 
sensory neurons in the dorsal roots of 
the spinal cord and the ganglia of the 
myenteric plexus responsible for the 
peristaltic movements of the digestive 
tube.
In the central nervous system (CNS) the 
concentrations of neuron bodies are 
called nuclei and not ganglia.
12. What is meant by the 
peripheral nervous system 
(PNS)?
The peripheral nervous system 
comprehends the nerves and ganglia of 
the body.
13. What is the function of the 
myelin sheath? Do all axons 
present a myelin sheath?
The function of the myelin sheath is to 
improve the safety and speed of the 
neural impulse transmission along the 
axon. The myelin sheath serves as an 
electrical insulator preventing the 
dispersion of the impulse to other 
adjacent structures. Since the myelin 
sheath has gaps called Ranviers’ nodes 
in its length, the neural impulse “jumps” 
from one node to another thus 
increasing the speed of the neural 
transmission.
Not all neurons have a myelin sheath. 
There are myelinated axonal fibers and 
unmyelinated ones.
14. What are the cells that 
produce the myelin sheath? Of 
which substance is the myelin 
sheath formed?
In the central nervous system (CNS) the 
myelin sheath is made by apposition of 
oligodendrocyte membranes. Each 
oligodendrocyte can cover portions of 
axons of several different neurons. In 
the peripheral nervous system (PNS) 
the myelin sheath is made by

consecutive Schwann cell membranes 
covering segments of a single axon. The 
Ranviers’ nodes appear in the 
intercellular space between these cells.
The myelin sheath is rich in lipids but it 
also contains proteins.
15. What are some diseases 
characterized by progressive 
loss of the axonal myelin 
sheath?
Multiple sclerosis is a severe disease 
caused by progressive destruction of the 
myelin sheath in the central nervous 
system. The Guillain-Barré disease is 
due to destruction of the myelin sheath 
in the peripheral nervous system caused 
by autoimmunity (attack by the own 
immune system). The genetic deficiency 
in the formation or preservation of the 
myelin sheath is an X-linked inheritance 
called adrenoleukodystrophy. The movie 
“Lorenzo’s Oil” featured a boy with this 
disease and his father's dramatic search 
for treatment.
16. What are meninges and 
cerebrospinal fluid?
Meninges are the membranes that 
enclose and protect the central nervous 
system (CNS). Cerebrospinal fluid is the 
fluid that separates the three layers that 
form the meninges and it has the 
functions of nutrient transport, defense 
and mechanical protection for the CNS.
The cerebrospinal fluid fills and protects 
cavities of the brain and the spinal cord.
17. What is the difference 
between brain and cerebrum? 
What are the main parts of 
these structures?
The concept of brain, or encephalon, 
comprehends the cerebrum (mostly 
referred to as the hemispheres, but 
actually the concept also includes the 
thalamus and the hypothalamus), the 
brainstem (midbrain, pons and medulla) 
and the cerebellum. Brain and spinal 
cord form the central nervous system 
(CNS).
18. How is the cerebrum 
anatomically divided?
The cerebrum is divided into two 
cerebral hemispheres, the right and the 
left. Each hemisphere is made of four 
cerebral lobes: frontal lobe, parietal 
lobe, temporal lobe and occipital lobe.
Each cerebral lobe contains the gray 
matter and the white matter. The gray 
matter is the outer portion and it is 
made of neuron bodies; the gray matter 
is also known as the cerebral cortex. 
The white matter is the inner portion 
and it is white because it is in the region 
where axons of the cortical neurons 
pass.
19. Which is the brain region 
responsible for the 
coordination and equilibrium 
of the body?
In the central nervous system the 
cerebellum is the main controller of the

motor coordination and equilibrium of 
the body. (Do not confuse this with 
muscle command, performed by the 
cerebral hemispheres).
20. Why is the cerebellum 
more developed in mammals 
that jump or fly?
The cerebellum is the main brain 
structure that coordinates the 
movement and the equilibrium of the 
body. For this reason it appears more 
developed in mammals that jump or fly 
(like bats). The cerebellum is also very 
important for the flight of birds.
21. Which is the brain region 
responsible for the regulation 
of breathing and blood 
pressure?
The neural regulation of breathing, 
blood pressure and other physiological 
parameters like heartbeat, digestive 
secretions, peristaltic movements and 
transpiration is performed by the 
medulla.
The medulla, together with the pons 
and the midbrain, is part of the 
brainstem.
22. Which is the brain region 
that receives conscious 
sensory information? Which is 
the brain region that triggers 
the voluntary motor activity?
In the brain conscious sensory 
information is received by the neurons 
situated in a special region called 
postcentral gyrus (or sensory gyrus). 
Gyri are the convolutions of the 
cerebrum. Each of the two postcentral 
gyri are located in one of the parietal 
lobes of the cerebrum.
The voluntary motor activity (voluntary 
muscle movement) is commanded by 
neurons situated in the precentral gyrus 
(or motor gyrus). Each of the two 
precentral gyri are located in one of the 
frontal lobes of the cerebrum.
The names post- and pre-central refer 
to the fact that the motor and sensory 
gyri are spaced apart in each cerebral 
hemisphere by the sulcus centralis, a 
fissure that separates the parietal and 
frontal lobes.
23. What is the spinal cord? Of 
which elements is the spinal 
cord constituted?
The spinal cord is the dorsal neural cord 
of vertebrates. It is the part of the 
central nervous system that continues 
in the trunk to facilitate the nervous 
integration of the whole body.
The spinal cord is made of groups of 
neurons situated in its central portion 
forming the gray matter and of axon 
fibers in its exterior portion forming the 
white matter. Neural bundles connect to 
both lateral sides of the spinal cord 
segments to form the dorsal and ventral 
spinal roots that join to form the spinal 
nerves. The dorsal spinal roots present 
a ganglion with neurons that receive 
sensory information; the ventral spinal

roots contain motor fibers. Therefore 
the dorsal roots are sensory roots and 
the ventral roots are motor roots.
24. Which are the brain 
regions associated with 
memory?
According to researchers some of the 
main regions of the nervous system 
associated with the memory 
phenomenon are the hippocampus, 
situated in the interior portion of the 
temporal lobes, and the frontal lobe 
cortex, both part of the cerebral 
hemispheres.
25. How is it structurally 
explained that the motor 
activity of the left side of the 
body is controlled by the right 
cerebral hemisphere and the 
motor activity of the right side 
of the body is controlled by 
the left cerebral hemisphere?
In the cerebral hemispheres there are 
neurons that centrally command and 
control muscle movements. These 
neurons are called superior motor 
neurons and they are located in a 
special gyrus of both frontal lobes 
known as motor gyrus (or precentral 
gyrus). The superior motor neurons 
send axons that transmit impulses to 
the inferior motor neurons of the spinal 
cord (for neck, trunk and limb 
movements) and to the motor nuclei of 
the cranial nerves (for face, eyes and 
mouth movements).
The fibers cross to the other side in 
specific areas of those axon paths. 
About 2/3 of the fibers that go down the 
spinal cord cross at the medullar level 
forming a structure known as pyramidal 
decussation. The other (1/3) of fibers 
descend in the same side of their 
original cerebral hemisphere and cross 
only within the spinal cord at the level 
where their associated motor spinal root 
exit. The fibers that command the 
inferior motor neurons of the cranial 
nerves cross to the other side just 
before the connection with the nuclei of 
these nerves.
The motor fibers that descend from the 
superior motor neurons to the inferior 
motor neurons of the spinal cord form 
the pyramidal tract. Injuries in this 
tract, for example, caused by spinal 
sections or by central or spinal tumors 
may lead to paraplegia and tetraplegia.
26. What is meant by the arch 
reflex?
In some situations the movement of the 
skeletal striated muscles does not 
depend upon commands of the superior 
motor neurons, i.e., it is not triggered 
by volition.
Involuntary movements of those 
muscles may happen when sensory 
fibers that make direct or indirect 
connection with inferior motor neurons 
are unexpectedly stimulated in 
situations that suggest danger to the 
body. This happens, for example, in the 
patellar reflex, or knee jerk reflex, when 
a sudden percussion on the knee patella 
(kneecap) triggers an involuntary 
contraction of the quadriceps (the 
extension muscle of the thigh). Another

example of the arch reflex occurs when 
someone steps on a sharp object: one 
leg retracts and the other, by the arch 
reflex, distends to maintain the 
equilibrium of the body.
27. Which are the types of 
neurons that participate in the 
spinal arch reflex? Where are 
their cell bodies situated?
In the arch reflex first a sensory neuron 
located in the ganglion of a dorsal spinal 
root collects the stimulus information 
from the tissues. This sensory neuron 
makes direct or indirect (through 
interneurons) connection with inferior 
motor neurons of the spinal cord. These 
motor neurons then command the reflex 
reaction. So sensory neurons, 
interneurons and inferior motor neurons 
participate in the arch reflex.
28. What are the respective 
constituents of the gray 
matter and of the white 
matter of the spinal cord?
The gray matter, or gray substance, of 
the spinal cord contains predominantly 
neuron bodies (inferior motor neurons, 
secondary sensory neurons and 
interneurons). The white matter is 
mainly made of axons that connect 
neurons of the brain with spinal 
neurons.
29. Is the neural impulse 
generated by the stimulus 
that triggers the arch reflex 
restricted within the neurons 
of this circuit?
The sensory fiber that first conducts the 
arch reflex connects with neurons of the 
arch reflex but it also connects with 
secondary sensory neurons of the spinal 
cord that transmit information upwards 
to other neurons of the brain. This is 
obvious since the person that received 
the initial stimulus (e.g., the percussion 
on his/her kneecap) perceives it 
(meaning that the brain became 
conscious of the fact).
30. How is it explained that a 
person with the spinal cord 
sectioned at the cervical level 
is still able to perform the 
patellar reflex?
The arch reflex depends only on the 
integrity of the fibers at a single spinal 
level. In the arch reflex the motor 
response to the stimulus is automatic 
and involuntary and does not depend 
upon the passage of information to the 
brain. So it happens even if the spinal 
cord is damaged at other levels.

affect the neural transmission 
in the spinal cord?

of the muscles that depend on these 
neurons.
32. Concerning volition of the 
individual how can the 
reactions of the nervous 
system be classified?
The efferences (reactions) of the 
nervous system can be classified into 
voluntary, when controlled by the will, 
and involuntary, those not consciously 
controlled. Examples of reactions 
triggered by volition are the movements 
of the limb, tongue and respiratory 
muscles. Examples of involuntary 
efferences are those that command the 
peristaltic movements, the heartbeat 
and the arterial wall muscles. The 
skeletal striated muscles are voluntarily 
contracted; the cardiac striated and the 
smooth muscles are involuntarily 
contracted.
33. What are the functional 
divisions of the nervous 
system?
Functionally the nervous system can be 
divided into the somatic nervous system 
and visceral nervous system.
The somatic nervous system includes 
the central and peripheral structures 
that make voluntary control of 
efferences. Central and peripheral 
structures that participate in the control 
of the vegetative (unconscious) 
functions of the body are included in the 
concept of visceral nervous system.
The efferent portion of the visceral 
nervous system is called the autonomic 
nervous system.
34. What are the two divisions 
of the autonomic nervous 
system?
The autonomic nervous system is 
divided into the sympathetic nervous 
system and the parasympathetic 
nervous system.
The sympathetic nervous system 
comprehends the nerves that come out 
from the ganglia of the neural chains 
lateral to the spinal column (near the 
spinal cord) and thus are distant from 
the tissues they innervate. The central 
and peripheral neurons associated to 
those neurons are also part of the 
sympathetic.
The parasympathetic nervous system is 
made of nerves and central or 
peripheral neurons related to the 
visceral ganglia, neural ganglia situated 
near the tissues they innervate.
35. What is the antagonism 
between the sympathetic and 
the parasympathetic neural 
actions?
In general the actions of the 
sympathetic and the parasympathetic 
are antagonistic, i.e., while one 
stimulates something the other inhibits 
and vice versa. The organs, with few 
exceptions, get efferences from these 
two systems and the antagonism

between them serves to modulate their 
effects. For example, the 
parasympathetic stimulates salivation 
while the sympathetic inhibits it; the 
parasympathetic constricts pupils while 
the sympathetic dilates it; the 
parasympathetic contracts the bronchi 
while the sympathetic relaxes them; the 
parasympathetic excites the genital 
organs while the parasympathetic 
inhibits the excitation.
36. Using examples of 
invertebrate nervous systems 
how can the process of 
evolutionary cephalization be 
described?
Considering the example of 
invertebrates it is observed that 
evolution makes the increasing of the 
complexity of the organisms to be 
accompanied by convergence of nervous 
cells to special structures for controlling 
and commanding: the ganglia and the 
brain. In simple invertebrates, like 
cnidarians, the nervous cells are not 
concentrated but they are found 
dispersed in the body. In 
platyhelminthes a beginning of 
cephalization with the anterior ganglion 
concentrating neurons is already 
verified. In annelids and arthropods the 
existence of a cerebral ganglion is 
evident. In cephalopod molluscs the 
cephalization is even greater and the 
brain commands the nervous system.
37. What are some main 
differences of the vertebrate 
nervous systems comparing to 
invertebrates?
In vertebrates the nervous system is 
well-characterized, having the brain and 
dorsal neural cord protected by rigid 
skeletal structures. In most 
invertebrates the nervous system is 
predominantly ganglial, with ventral 
neural cords.
38. What are the protective 
structures of the central 
nervous system present in 
vertebrates?
In vertebrates the brain and the spinal 
cord are protected by membranes, the 
meninges, and by osseous structures, 
respectively the skull and the vertebral 
column. These protections are 
fundamental for the integrity of those 
important organs that command the 
functioning of the body.
39. What is the nature of the 
stimulus received and 
transmitted by the neurons?
Neurons receive and transmit chemical 
stimuli through neurotransmitters 
released in the synapses. Along the 
neuron body however the impulse 
transmission is electrical. So neurons 
conduct electric and chemical stimuli.
40. What are the two main 
ions that participate in the 
electrical impulse 
transmission in neurons?

Biology Questions and Answers
The two main ions that participate in the 
electrical impulse transmission in 
neurons are the sodium cation (Na+) 
and the potassium cation (K+).
41. Which is the normal sign 
of the electric charge between 
the two sides of the neuron 
plasma membrane? What is 
the potential difference 
(voltage) generated between 
these two sides? What is that 
voltage called?
As in most cells the region just outside 
the surface of the neuron plasma 
membrane presents a positive electrical 
charge in relation to the region just 
inside that thus is negative.
The normal (at rest) potential difference 
across the neuron membrane is about –
70 mV (millivolts). This voltage is called 
the resting potential of the neuron.
42. How do the sodium and 
potassium ions maintain the 
resting potential of the 
neuron?
The plasma membrane of the neuron 
when at rest maintains an electric 
potential difference between its external 
and internal surfaces. This voltage is 
called resting potential. The resting 
potential about –70 mV indicates that 
the interior is more negative than the 
exterior (negative polarization). This 
condition is maintained by transport of 
sodium and potassium ions across the 
plasma membrane.
The membrane is permeable to 
potassium ions but not to sodium ions. 
At rest the positive potassium ions exit 
the cell in favor of the concentration 
gradient since within the cell the 
potassium concentration is higher than 
in the extracellular space. The positive 
sodium ions cannot however go into the 
cell. As positive potassium ions exit the 
cell with not enough compensation of 
positive ions entering the cell, the 
intracellular space becomes more 
negative and the cell stays polarized.
43. How is the depolarization 
of the neuronal plasma 
membrane generated? How 
does the cell return to its 
original rest?
When the neuron receives a stimulus by 
the binding of neurotransmitters to 
specific receptors sodium channels open 
and the permeability of the plasma 
membrane in the postsynaptic region is 
altered. Sodium ions then go into the 
cell causing lowering (less negative) of 
the membrane potential. If this 
reduction of the membrane potential 
reaches a level called the excitation 
threshold, or threshold potential, about 
–50 mV, the action potential is 
generated, i.e., the depolarization 
intensifies until reaching its maximum 
level and the depolarization current is 
transmitted along the remaining length 
of the neuronal membrane.
If the excitation threshold is reached 
voltage-dependent sodium channels in 
the membrane open allowing more 
sodium ions to enter the cell in favor of 
the concentration gradient and an 
approximate –35 mV level of positive

Biology Questions and Answers
polarization of the membrane is 
achieved. The voltage-dependent 
sodium channels then close and more 
voltage-dependent potassium channels 
open. Potassium ions then exit the cell 
in favor of the concentration gradient 
and the potential difference of the 
membrane decreases, a process called 
repolarization.
The action potential triggers the same 
electrical phenomenon in neighboring 
regions of the plasma membrane and 
the impulse is thus transmitted from the 
dendrites to the terminal region of the 
axon.
44. What is the excitation 
threshold of a neuron? How 
does this threshold relate to 
the “all-or-nothing” rule of the 
neural transmission?
The excitation threshold of a neuron is 
the depolarization level that must be 
caused by a stimulus to be transmitted 
as a neural impulse. This value is about 
–50 mV.
The transmission of the neural impulse 
along the neuronal membrane obeys an 
all-or-nothing rule: or it happens with 
maximum intensity or nothing happens. 
Always and only when the excitation 
threshold is reached the depolarization 
continues and the membrane reaches 
its maximum possible positive 
polarization, about +35 mV. If the 
excitation threshold is not reached 
nothing happens.
45. How does the 
depolarization of the neuronal 
membrane start?
The primary cause of the neuronal 
depolarization is the binding of 
neurotransmitters released in the 
synapse (by the axon of the neuron that 
sent the signal) to specific receptors in 
the membrane of the neuron that is 
receiving the stimulus. The binding of 
neurotransmitters to those receptors is 
a reversible phenomenon that alters the 
membrane permeability of the region 
since the binding causes sodium 
channels to open. When positive sodium 
ions enter the cell in favor of their 
concentration gradient, the membrane 
voltage increases, thus lessening the 
negative polarization. If this 
depolarization reaches the excitation 
threshold (about –50 mV) the 
depolarization continues, the action 
potential is reached and the impulse is 
transmitted along the cell membrane.
46. How different are the 
concepts of action potential, 
resting potential and 
excitation threshold 
concerning neurons?
Action potential is the maximum 
positive voltage level achieved by the 
neuron in the process of neuronal 
activation, around + 35 mV. The action 
potential triggers the depolarization of 
the neighboring regions of the plasma 
membrane and thus the propagation of 
the impulse along the neuron.

Biology Questions and Answers
Resting potential is the membrane 
voltage when the cell is not excited, 
about –70 mV.
Excitation threshold is the voltage level, 
about –50 mV, that the initial 
depolarization must reach for the action 
potential to be attained.
47. In chemical terms how is 
the neuronal repolarization 
achieved?
Repolarization is the return of the 
membrane potential from the action 
potential (+35 mV) to the resting 
potential (-70 mV).
When the membrane reaches its action 
potential voltage-gated sodium channels 
close and voltage-gated potassium 
channels open. So sodium stops 
entering into the cell and potassium 
starts to exit. Therefore the 
repolarization is due to exiting of 
potassium cations from the cell.
The repolarization causes the potential 
difference temporarily to increase under 
–70 mV, below the resting potential, a 
phenomenon known as 
hyperpolarization.
48. What is the mechanism by 
which the neural impulse is 
transmitted along the axon?
The neural impulse is transmitted along 
the neuronal membrane through 
depolarization of consecutive 
neighboring regions. When a region in 
the internal surface of the membrane is 
depolarized it becomes more positive in 
relation to the neighboring internal 
region. So positive electrical charges 
(ions) move towards this more negative 
region and voltage-gated sodium 
channels are activated and open. The 
action potential then linearly propagates 
along the membrane until near the 
presynaptic region of the axon.
49. What is the structure 
through which the neural 
impulse is transmitted from 
one cell to another? What are 
its parts?
The structure through which the neural 
impulse passes from one cell to another 
is the synapse. The synapse is 
composed by the presynaptic 
membrane in the terminal portion of the 
axon of the transmitter cell, the 
synaptic cleft (or synaptic space) and 
the postsynaptic membrane in the 
dendrite of the receptor cell.
50. How does synaptic 
transmission between neurons 
take place?
The propagation of the action potential 
along the axon reaches the region 
immediately anterior to the presynaptic 
membrane causing its permeability to 
calcium ions to change and these ions 
to enter the cell. In the presynaptic area 
of the axon there are many 
neurotransmitter-repleted vesicles that 
by means of exocytosis activated by the 
calcium influx release the 
neurotransmitters into the synaptic

cleft. The neurotransmitters then bind 
to specific receptors of the postsynaptic 
membrane. (The binding of 
neurotransmitters to their receptors is 
reversible, i.e., the neurotransmitters 
are not consumed after the process.) 
With the binding of neurotransmitters to 
the postsynaptic receptors the 
permeability of the postsynaptic 
membrane is altered and the 
depolarization that will lead to the first 
action potential of the postsynaptic cell 
begins.
51. What are some important 
neurotransmitters?
The following are some 
neurotransmitters: adrenaline 
(epinephrine), noradrenaline 
(norepinephrine), acetylcholine, 
dopamine, serotonin, histamine, gaba 
(gamma aminobutyric acid), glycine, 
aspartate, nitric oxide.
52. Since neurotransmitters 
are not consumed in the 
synaptic process, what are the 
mechanisms to reduce their 
concentrations in the synaptic 
cleft after they have been 
used?
Since the binding of neurotransmitters 
to the postsynaptic receptors is 
reversible, after these neurochemicals 
perform their role they must be 
eliminated from the synaptic cleft. 
Neurotransmitters can then bind to 
specific proteins that carry them back to 
the axon they came from in a process 
called neurotransmitter re-uptake. They 
can also be destroyed by specific 
enzymes, like acetylcholinesterase, an 
enzyme that destroys acetylcholine. Or 
they can simply diffuse out of the 
synaptic cleft.
53. Fluoxetine is an 
antidepressant drug that 
presents an action mechanism 
related to the synaptic 
transmission. What is that 
mechanism?
Fluoxetine is a substance that inhibits 
the re-uptake of serotonin, a 
neurotransmitter that acts mainly in the 
central nervous system. By inhibiting 
the re-uptake of the neurotransmitter 
the drug increases its availability in the 
synaptic cleft thus improving the 
neuronal transmission.
54. What is the neuromuscular 
synapse?
Neuromuscular synapse is the structure 
through which the neural impulse 
passes from the axon of a motor neuron 
to the muscle cell. This structure is also 
known as neuromuscular junction, or 
motor end plate. As in the nervous 
synapse, the axonal terminal membrane 
releases the neurotransmitter 
acetylcholine in the cleft between the 
two cells. Acetylcholine binds to specific 
receptors of the muscle membrane, 
dependent sodium channels then open 
and the depolarization of the muscle 
membrane begins. The impulse is then 
transmitted to the sarcoplasmic

reticulum that releases calcium ions into 
the sarcomeres of the myofibrils thus 
triggering contraction.
55. How does the nervous 
system get information about 
the external environment, the 
organs and the tissues?
Information about the conditions of the 
external and internal environments, like 
temperature, pressure, touch, spatial 
position, pH, metabolite levels (oxygen, 
carbon dioxide, etc.), light, sounds, etc., 
are collected by specific neural 
structures (each for each type of 
information) called sensory receptors. 
Sensory receptors are distributed 
throughout the tissues according to 
their specific roles. The receptors get 
that information and transmit them 
through their own axons or through 
dendrites of neurons that connect to 
them. The information reaches the 
central nervous system that interprets 
and uses it to control and regulate the 
body.
56. What are sensory 
receptors?
Sensory receptors are structures 
specialized in the acquiring of 
information, like temperature, 
mechanical pressure, pH, chemical 
environment and luminosity, 
transmitting them to the central 
nervous system. Sensory receptors may 
be specialized cells, e.g., the 
photoreceptors of the retina, or 
specialized interstitial structures, for 
example the vibration receptors of the 
skin. In this last case they transmit 
information to dendrites of sensory 
neurons connected to them. There are 
also sensory receptors that are 
specialized terminations of neuronal 
dendrites (e.g., the olfactory receptors).
57. According to the stimuli 
they collect how are the 
sensory receptors classified?
The sensory receptors are classified 
according to the stimuli they get: 
mechanoreceptors are stimulated by 
pressure (e.g., touch or sound); 
chemoreceptors respond to chemical 
stimuli (olfactory, taste, pH, metabolite 
concentration, etc.); thermoreceptors 
are sensitive to temperature changes; 
photoreceptors are stimulated by light; 
nocireceptors send pain information; 
proprioceptors are sensitive to the 
spatial position of muscles and joints 
(they generate information for the 
equilibrium of the body).

Biology Questions and Answers
Visual System
1. What is vision? Why is 
vision important for life on 
earth?
Vision is the ability of some living beings 
to perceive, to distinguish and to 
interpret luminous stimuli.
Vision is important on earth mainly in 
the terrestrial and in the superficial 
aquatic habitats because our planet is 
intensely exposed to sunlight and thus 
light and colors become distinguishing 
factors of objects present in the 
environment, even at distance. This 
distinction provided new survival 
strategies for the organisms, new 
protection mechanisms against external 
dangers, new ways to find food and to 
communicate with other individuals, 
new types of courting and reproduction 
behaviors, etc. That is, it created new 
possibilities of interaction with the 
surrounds and increased capacity to 
explore new ecological niches.
2. How does photosensitivity 
in cnidarians, annelids and 
worms differ from insects, 
cephalopods and vertebrates?
In the first mentioned group of animals 
there are photoreceptor cells organized 
in ocelli or diffusely dispersed in the 
body. These animals do not form 
images.
In the animals of the second group the 
photoreceptor cells are part of more 
sophisticated structures, the eyes, able 
to form images and to send them to the 
nervous system.
3. What are the structures 
that compose the human 
vision apparatus?
The organs of the human visual 
apparatus are the eyes, the optical 
nerves and the visual areas of the brain 
(located in the occipital lobes of both 
hemispheres).
4. What are the main 
structures of the human eye?
The main structures of the human eye 
are the cornea, the iris, the pupil, the 
ciliary muscles, the crystalline lens and 
the retina (the space between the 
crystalline lens and the retina within the 
eyeball is filled with vitreous humor).
5. What is the function of the 
iris and of the pupil?
The iris works like the diaphragm of a 
photographic camera since it has 
muscles that contract or relax varying 
the pupil diameter. When the luminous 
intensity heightens the parasympathetic 
nervous system commands the 
contraction of the pupil; when there is 
shortage of light the sympathetic 
nervous system stimulates the dilation

of the pupils. These movements depend 
upon the muscles of the iris.
6. Which is the part of the 
human visual system where 
the receptors that sense light, 
i.e., the photoreceptor cells, 
are located? How do those 
cells work?
The photoreceptor cells form the retina, 
a lamina that covers the internal 
posterior region of the eyeball. The 
photosensitive cells of the retina are 
divided into two types: the cone cells 
and the rod cells. These cells have 
pigments that sense specific light wave 
ranges (frequencies) and trigger action 
potentials conducted by the optical 
nerves to the visual area of the brain.
7. Since the visual images are 
projected in an inverted 
manner on the retina why 
don't we see things upside 
down?
Since the crystalline lens is a convex 
spherical lens it forms inverted images 
on the retina (every converging lens 
forms inverted images). The inverted 
information follows through the optical 
nerves until the occipital cerebral cortex 
that contains the visual area of the 
brain. In the brain the interpretation of 
the image takes place and the inverted 
information is reverted.
8. What type of structure is 
the crystalline lens? What is 
its function?
The crystalline is a converging spherical 
lens. This natural lens has the function 
to project images of objects onto the 
retina.
9. What is visual 
accommodation?
Visual accommodation is the 
phenomenon of varying the curvature of 
the crystalline lens to make possible the 
variation of its refractivity to adjust the 
images of objects exactly onto the 
retina. The visual accommodation is 
accomplished by the action of the ciliary 
muscles.
The nitid vision depends on the visual 
accommodation since, if the images are 
not projected onto the retina but in 
front or behind it, they will appear 
blurred. The closer an object is more 
the ciliary muscles must compress the 
crystalline lens (increasing its 
curvature); the more distant an object 
is more the ciliary muscles must relax.
10. What are the near point 
and the far point of the vision?
The near point is the closest distance 
between an object and the eye that 
makes possible the formed image to be 
focused, i.e., it is the point in which the 
ciliary muscles are in their maximum 
contraction. The far point is the most 
distant point from the eye in which an

object can be placed and its image is 
still focused, i.e., it is the situation of 
maximum relaxation of the ciliary 
muscles. The zone between the near 
point and the far point is called the 
accommodation zone.
11. How can the visual 
deficiencies known as myopia 
and hypermetropia be 
optically explained?
Myopia is the visual condition in which 
the images are formed before (in front 
of) the retina. Hypermetropia is the 
visual condition in which the point of 
image formation is beyond (behind) the 
retina. Actually myopia is due to an 
increase in the distance between the 
retina and the crystalline lens, mainly 
caused by a slight flattening of the 
eyeball. In hypermetropia the retina is 
too close to the crystalline lens due to 
slight shortening of the eyeball.
In myopia the near point and the far 
point of vision come closer (the 
refractivity of the crystalline lens that 
corresponds to the maximum distension 
capacity of the ciliary muscles is not 
enough to provide visual 
accommodation). In hypermetropia the 
ciliary muscles are not able to contract 
more to compensate the inadequate 
position of the retina, i.e., the near 
point becomes more distant.
12. What are presbyopia and 
astigmatism?
Presbyopia is the visual impairment in 
which there is loss of the cililary muscle 
strength thus reducing the capability of 
the crystalline lens to adjust images of 
near objects onto the retina. In 
presbyopia the near point of vision 
becomes more distant. The disease 
generally occurs in old people.
Astigmatism is caused by irregular 
shape of the refractive structures, 
mainly the cornea. In astigmatism a 
single object-point may produce more 
than one image onto the retina and so 
the vision becomes distorted.

Hearing System
1. What are the structures 
that participate in the human 
auditory sensitivity?
The structures of the human auditory 
sensitivity are the ears (external, middle 
and internal), the vestibulocochlear 
nerves and the auditory areas of the 
brain (located in the temporal lobes of 
both hemispheres).
2. What are the main parts of 
the human ear?
The human ear is divided into three 
mains parts: the external ear, the 
middle ear and the internal ear.
3. What are the structures 
that form the external ear? 
What is its function?
The internal ear comprises the pinna, or 
auricle, and the auditory canal. Its 
function is to conduct the sound waves 
to the tympanum.
4. What are the elements that 
form the middle ear? What are 
the names of the three middle 
ear ossicles that participate in 
the phonosensitivity?
The middle ear is formed by the 
tympanum, the ossicular chain and the 
oval window. The functional ossicles of 
the middle ear are the hammer 
(malleus), the incus and the stapes.
5. What is the tympanum? In 
which part of the ear is it 
located and what is its 
function?
The tympanum (or ear drum) is a 
membrane located in the middle ear 
just after the auditory canal and so it 
separates the middle ear from the 
external ear. The function of the 
tympanum is to vibrate with the same 
frequency of the sound waves that 
reach it.
6. How is the sound vibration 
captured by the tympanum 
transmitted through the 
ossicular chain of the middle 
ear?
The acoustic transmission from the 
external to the middle ear (and to the 
internal ear too) is entirely mechanical. 
The vibration of the tympanic 
membrane triggers the vibration of the 
hammer that then causes the incus to

stapes to vibrate.
7. What are the elements that 
constitute the internal ear? 
What are the functions of 
those structures?
In the internal ear there are the cochlea 
and the semicircular canals. The fluid 
that fills the cochlea receives vibration 
from the ossicular chain of the middle 
ear and transmits the pressure to the 
semicircular canals. Within the 
semicircular canals the pressure 
variation of the filling fluid moves cilia of 
the hair cells of these structures. The 
hair cells then generate action 
potentials that are transmitted to the 
brain through the auditory nerves.
8. Why is there a sense of 
pressure change inside the ear 
when someone goes down a 
mountain?
The pressure inside the middle ear is 
maintained equal to the external ear (so 
to the exterior too) due to a 
communicating duct between the middle 
ear and the pharynx called the auditory 
tube, or Eustachian tube. When 
someone goes down a mountain the air 
pressure upon the middle ear increases 
and it is necessary to do some exercises 
like fake swallowing to force the 
opening of the pharyngeal orifice of the 
auditory tube to equalize the pressure 
again.
9. What is the vestibular 
system? How does it operate?
The vestibular system is the part of the 
ear that participates in the control and 
regulation of the equilibrium of the body 
(balance).
The semicircular canals of the inner 
(internal) ear are perpendicularly placed 
and detect changes in the gravitational 
position of the head (this is another 
sensorial function of the inner ear, 
besides auditory perception). When the 
head rotates the pressure of the fluid 
within the canals upon the cilia of 
specific receptor cells varies and these 
cells generate action potentials 
transmitted by the vestibulocochlear 
nerve. The neural impulse is then 
interpreted by the brain as information 
about the gravitational position of the 
head.

Biology Questions and Answers
Endocrine System
1. What is the difference 
between the endocrine gland 
and the exocrine gland?
Endocrine gland is a gland whose 
secretions (called hormones) are 
collected by the blood and reach the 
tissues through the circulation. The 
hypophysis (pituitary) and the adrenals 
are examples of endocrine glands. 
Exocrine gland is a gland whose 
secretions are released externally 
through ducts (into the skin, intestinal 
lumen, mouth, etc.). The sebaceous 
glands and the salivary glands are 
examples of exocrine glands.
2. What is the constitution of 
the endocrine system?
The endocrine system is constituted by 
the endocrine glands and the hormones 
they secrete.
3. What is the histological 
nature of the glands? How are 
they formed?
The glands are epithelial tissues. They 
are made of epithelium that during the 
embryonic development invaginated 
into other tissues.
In the exocrine glands the invagination 
has preserved secretion ducts. In the 
endocrine glands the invagination is 
complete and there are no secretion 
ducts.
4. Why is the endocrine 
system considered one of the 
integrative systems of the 
body? What is the other 
physiological system that also 
has this function?
The endocrine system is said to have 
integrative character since the 
hormones produced by the endocrine 
glands are substances that act at a 
distance and many of them act in 
different organs of the body. So the 
endocrine glands receive information 
from some regions of the body and they 
can produce effects in other regions 
providing functional integration for the 
body.
Besides the endocrine system, the other 
physiological system that also has 
integrative function is the nervous 
system. The nervous system integrates 
the body through a network of nerves 
connected to central and peripheral 
neurons. The endocrine system 
integrates the body through hormones 
that travel through the circulation and 
are produced by the endocrine glands.
5. What are hormones?
Hormones are substances secreted by 
the endocrine glands and collected by 
the circulation that act to produce 
effects upon specific organs and tissues.

Biology Questions and Answers
Hormones are effectors of the endocrine 
system.
6. What are target organs of 
the hormones?
Target organs, target tissues and target 
cells are those specific organs, tissues 
and cells upon which each hormone acts 
and produces its effects. Hormones 
selectively act upon their targets due to 
specific receptor proteins present in 
these targets.
7. How does the circulatory 
system participate in the 
functioning of the endocrine 
system?
The circulatory system is fundamental 
for the functioning of the endocrine 
system. The blood collects the 
hormones made by the endocrine 
glands and through the circulation these 
hormones reach their targets. Without 
the circulatory system the 'action at 
distance' characteristic of the endocrine 
system would not be possible.
8. Are hormones only 
proteins?
Some hormones are proteins, like 
insulin, glucagon and ADH, others are 
derived from proteins (modified amino 
acids), like adrenaline and 
noradrenaline, other are steroids, like 
the corticosteroids and estrogen.
9. What are the main 
endocrine glands of the 
human body?
The main endocrine glands of the 
human body are the pineal gland (or 
pineal body), the hypophysis (or 
pituitary), the thyroid, the parathyroids, 
the endocrine part of the pancreas, the 
adrenals and the gonads (testicles or 
ovaries).
Other organs like the kidneys, the heart 
and the placenta also have endocrine 
functions.
10. What is the pineal gland?
The pineal gland, also known as pineal 
body or epiphysis, is situated centrally 
in the head. It secretes the hormone 
melatonin, a hormone produced at night 
and related to the regulation of the 
circadian rhythm (or circadian cycle, the 
wakefulness-sleep cycle). Melatonin 
possibly regulates many body functions 
related to the night-day alternation.
11. What is the osseous cavity 
where the pituitary gland is 
located?
The pituitary gland, or hypophysis, is 
located in the sella turcica of the 
sphenoid bone (one of the bones in the 
base of the skull). So the gland is 
situated within the head.

Biology Questions and Answers
12. What are the main 
divisions of the hypophysis? 
What are their functions?
The hypophysis is divided into two 
portions: the adenohypophysis, or 
anterior hypophysis, and the 
neurohypophysis, or posterior 
hypophysis.
In the adenohypophysis two hormones 
that act directly, the growth hormone 
(GH) and the prolactin, and four tropic 
hormones, i.e., hormones that regulate 
other endocrine glands, the 
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), 
the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 
the luteinizing hormone (LH) and the 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are 
produced.
The neurohypohysis stores and releases 
two hormones produced in the 
hypothalamus, oxytocin and the 
antidiuretic hormone (ADH, or 
vasopressin).
13. What is the relation 
between the hypothalamus 
and the hypophysis?
The hypothalamus is a part of the brain 
situated just above the hypophysis. The 
hypothalamus gets peripheral and 
central neural impulses that trigger 
response of its neurosecretory cells. The 
axons of these cells go down to the 
adenohypophysis to regulate the 
hipophyseal secretions by means of 
negative feedback. When the plasma 
levels of adenohypophyseal hormones 
are too high the hypothalamus detects 
this information and commands the 
interruption of the production of the 
hormone. When the blood level of an 
adenohypophyseal hormone is low the 
hypothalamus stimulates the secretion 
of the hormone.
The hypothalamic cells produce the 
hormones released by the 
neurohypophysis. These hormones are 
transported by their axons to the 
hypophysis and then released in the 
circulation.
14. What are the hormones 
secreted by the 
adenohypophysis? What are 
their respective functions?
The adenohypophisys secretes GH 
(growth hormone), prolactin, ACTH 
(adrenocorticotropic hormone), TSH 
(thyroid-stimulating hormone), FSH 
(follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH 
(luteinizing hormone).
GH, also known as somatotropic 
hormone (STH), acts upon bones, 
cartilages and muscles promoting the 
growth of these tissues. Prolactin is the 
hormone that in women stimulates the 
production and secretion of milk by the 
mammary glands. The ACTH is the 
hormone that stimulates the cortical 
portion of the adrenal gland to produce 
and secrete the cortical hormones 
(glucocorticoids). The TSH is the 
hormone that stimulates the activity of 
the thyroid gland increasing the 
production and secretion of its 
hormones T3 and T4. The FSH is a 
gonadotropic hormone, i.e., it 
stimulates the gonads and in women it 
acts upon the ovaries inducing the 
growth of follicles, in men it stimulates 
spermatogenesis. The LH is also a

gonadotropic hormone that acts upon 
the ovaries of women to stimulate 
ovulation and the formation of the 
corpus luteum (that secretes estrogen) 
and in men upon the testicles to 
stimulate the production of 
testosterone.
15. What is the relation 
between the thyroid and the 
hypophysis?
The hypophysis secretes TSH, thyroid-
stimulating hormone. This hormone 
hastens the secretion of thyroid 
hormones (triiodothyronine and 
thyroxine, or T3 and T4).
When the plasma concentration of 
thyroid hormones is high this 
information is detected by the 
hypothalamus and by the hypophysis 
and this gland reduces the TSH 
secretion. When the thyroid hormone 
levels are low the TSH secretion 
increases. It is thus a negative 
feedback.
Injuries of the hypophysis that cause 
TSH hyposecretion (for example, in case 
of tissue destruction) or hypersecretion 
(in case, e,g., of excessive cell 
proliferation or cancer) can change the 
functioning of the thyroid gland 
completely.
16. What are some diseases 
caused by abnormal GH 
secretion by the hypophysis?
In childhood deficient GH secretion may 
lead to delayed growth and in severe 
cases to nanism (dwarfism). Excessive 
production of GH in children may cause 
exaggerated osseous growth and 
gigantism. In adults GH excess (for 
example, in hypophiseal cancer or in 
people that wrongly ingest GH as a 
nutritional supplement) may lead to 
acromegaly, excessive and 
disproportional growth of the bone 
extremities, like the skull, the 
maxillaries, the hands and the feet.
17. What are the target 
tissues and target organs of 
each adenohypophyseal 
hormone?
GH: bones, cartilages and muscles. 
Prolactin: mammary glands. ACTH: the 
cortical portion of the adrenals. TSH: 
thyroid gland. FSH and LH: ovaries and 
testicles.
18. What are the hormones 
secreted by the 
neurohypophysis? What are 
their respective functions?
The neurohypophysis secretes oxytocin 
and the antidiuretic hormone (ADH).
Oxytocin is secreted in women during 
delivery to increase the strength and 
frequency of the uterine contractions 
and thus to help the baby’s birth. 
During the lactation period the infant’s 
sucking action on the mother’s nipples 
stimulates the production of oxytocin 
that then increases the secretion of milk 
by the mammary glands.

Biology Questions and Answers
Vasopressin, or ADH, participates in the 
water regulation of the body and thus in 
the control of the blood pressure since it 
allows the resorption of free water 
through the renal tubules. As water 
goes back to the circulation the blood 
volume increases.
19. What is the difference 
between diabetes mellitus and 
diabetes insipidus? What are 
the characteristic signs of 
diabetes insipidus?
Diabetes mellitus is the disease caused 
by deficient insulin secretion by the 
pancreas or by impaired capturing of 
this hormone by the cells. Diabetes 
insipidus is the disease caused by 
deficient ADH secretion by the pituitary 
(hypophysis) or also by impaired 
sensitivity of the kidneys to this 
hormone.
In diabetes insipidus the blood lacks 
ADH and so tubular resorption of water 
in the kidneys is reduced and a great 
volume of urine is produced. The patient 
urinates a lot and many times a day, a 
sign also accompanied by polydipsia 
(increased thirst and exaggerated 
ingestion of water) and sometimes by 
dehydration.
20. Why does the urinary 
volume increase when 
alcoholic beverages are 
ingested?
Alcohol inhibits the ADH (antidiuretic 
hormone) secretion by the hypophysis. 
Low ADH reduces the tubular resorption 
of water in the kidneys and thus the 
urinary volume increases.
21. Which are the target 
organs and target tissues of 
the neurohypophysis?
The target organs of oxytocin are the 
uterus and the mammary glands. The 
target organs of ADH are the kidneys.
22. Where in the body is the 
thyroid gland located?
The thyroid is located in the anterior 
cervical region (frontal neck), in front of 
the trachea and just below the larynx. It 
is a bilobated mass below the Adam’s 
apple.
23. What are the hormones 
secreted by the thyroid gland? 
What are their functions?
The thyroid secretes the hormones 
thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) 
and calcitonin.
T3 and T4 are iodinated substances 
derived from the amino acid tyrosine. 
They act to increase the cellular 
metabolic rate of the body (cellular 
respiration, metabolism of proteins and 
lipids, etc.). Calcitonin inhibits the 
release of calcium cations by the bones 
thus controlling the blood level of 
calcium.

Biology Questions and Answers
24. Why is the dietary 
obtainment of iodine so 
important for thyroid 
functioning?
The obtainment of iodine from the diet 
is important for the thyroid because this 
chemical element is necessary for the 
synthesis of the thyroid hormones T3 
and T4. The iodine supply often comes 
from the diet.
25. What is a goiter? What is 
endemic goiter? How is this 
problem socially solved?
Goiter is the abnormal enlargement of 
the thyroid gland. The goiter appears as 
a tumor in the anterior neck and it may 
be visible or sometimes not visible but 
palpable. Goiter can occur in 
hypothyroidism or in hyperthyroidism.
Endemic goiter is the goiter caused by 
deficient iodine ingestion (deficiency of 
iodine in the diet). The endemic 
character of the disease is explained 
because the iodine content of the diet is 
often a social or cultural condition 
affecting many people of some 
geographical regions. The 
hypothyroidism caused by deficient 
iodine ingestion is more frequent in 
regions far from the sea coast (since 
sea food is rich in iodine).
Nowadays the problem is often solved 
by obligatory addition of iodine in table 
salt. As table salt is a widely used 
condiment the supply of iodine in diet is 
almost assured by this method.
26. What happens to the TSH 
(thyroid-stimulating hormone) 
blood level in hypothyroidism? 
Why is there enlargement of 
the thyroid in the endemic 
goiter disease?
When there is low T3 and T4 secretion 
by the thyroid the TSH secretion by the 
hypophysis is very stimulated and the 
TSH blood level increases. The increase 
in the TSH availability promotes the 
enlargement of the thyroid gland.
The thyroid enlargement is a reaction of 
a tissue that tries to compensate the 
functional deficiency by making the 
gland increase its size.
27. What are some signs and 
symptoms found in patients 
with hyperthyroidism?
The hormones made by the thyroid 
gland stimulate the basal metabolism of 
the body. In hyperthyroidism there is 
abnormally high production and 
secretion of T3 and T4 so the basal 
metabolic rate is increased. The signs of 
this condition may be tachycardia 
(abnormally high heart rate), weight 
loss, excessive heat sensation, 
excessive sweating, anxiety, etc. One of 
the typical signs of hyperthyroidism is 
exophthalmos (protrusion of the 
eyeballs). Generally the patient also 
presents goiter.

28. What are some signs and 
symptoms found in patients 
with hypothyroidism?
In hypothyroidism the production and 
secretion of T3 and T4 are impaired. 
Since these thyroid hormones stimulate 
the basal metabolism of the body 
(cellular respiration, fat acid and protein 
metabolism, etc.) the patient with 
hypothyroidism may present 
bradycardia (low heart rate), low 
respiratory rate, excessive tiredness, 
depression, cold intolerance and weight 
gain. Hypothyroidism is normally 
accompanied by goiter (enlargement of 
the thyroid in the neck).
29. What is the physiological 
cause of the syndrome known 
as cretinism?
Cretinism is caused by chronic 
deficiency of the thyroid hormones (T3 
and T4) during childhood. The chronic 
hypothyroidism during childhood may 
cause retardation and low stature due to 
the low basal metabolic rate in a period 
of life when growth and development of 
mind faculties occur.
30. What are the 
parathyroids? Where are they 
located and what are the 
hormones secreted by these 
glands?
The parathyroids are four small glands 
embedded two in each posterior face of 
one thyroid lobe. The parathyroids 
secrete parathormone, a hormone that 
together with calcitonin and vitamin D 
regulates the calcium blood level.
31. What is the relation 
between secretion of 
parathormone and the calcium 
blood level?
The parathormone increases the calcium 
blood level since it stimulates the 
resorption (remodelation) of the 
osseous tissue. When osteoclasts 
remodel bones calcium is released in 
the circulation.
Parathormone also acts increasing the 
calcium absorption in the intestines by 
vitamin D activation. It acts in the 
kidneys promoting tubular calcium 
resorption too.
32. What is a mixed gland? 
Why is the pancreas 
considered a mixed gland?
Mixed gland is a gland that produces 
endocrine and exocrine secretions.
The pancreas is an example of a mixed 
gland because it secretes hormones in 
the circulation, like insulin and 
glucagon, but it also releases an 
exocrine secretion, the pancreatic juice.

Biology Questions and Answers
33. What are the pancreatic 
tissues involved respectively 
in the exocrine and endocrine 
secretions? What are their 
respective hormones and 
enzymes?
The exocrine secretion of the pancreas 
is produced in the pancreatic acini, 
aggregates of secretory cells that 
surround small exocrine ducts. The 
exocrine pancreas secretes digestive 
enzymes of the pancreatic juice: 
amylase, lipase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, 
carboxypeptidase, ribonuclease, 
deoxyribonuclease, elastase and 
gelatinase.
The endocrine secretion of the pancreas 
is produced and secreted by small 
groups of cells dispersed throughout the 
organ called islets of Langerhans. The 
pancreatic islets make insulin, glucagon 
and somatostatin.
34. What is the importance of 
the glucose blood level for 
human health?
The glucose blood level (glycemia) must 
be kept normal. If it is abnormally low 
there is not enough glucose to supply 
the energetic metabolism of the cells. If 
it is abnormally and chronically high it 
causes severe harm to the peripheral 
nerves, the skin, the retina, the kidneys 
and other important organs and it may 
predispose to cardiovascular diseases 
(acute myocardial infarction, strokes, 
thrombosis, etc). If it is acutely too high 
medical emergencies like diabetic 
ketoacidosis and the hyperglycemic 
hyperosmolar state may occur.
35. What are the functions of 
insulin and glucagon for the 
blood glucose control?
Glucagon increases glycemia and insulin 
reduces it. They are antagonistic 
pancreatic hormones. Glucagon acts 
stimulating glycogenolysis and thus 
forming glucose from glycogen 
breaking. Insulin is the hormone 
responsible for the entrance of glucose 
from the blood into the cells.
When glycemia is low, for example, 
during fasting, glucagon is secreted and 
insulin is inhibited. When glycemia is 
high, as after meals, there are inhibition 
of glucagon and more secretion of 
insulin.
36. What are the target 
organs upon which insulin and 
glucagon act?
Glucagon mainly acts upon the liver. 
Insulin acts in general upon all cells. 
Both also act upon the adipose tissue 
respectively stimulating (glucagon) and 
inhibiting (insulin) the use of fatty acids 
in the energetic metabolism (an 
alternate path of the energetic 
metabolism is activated when there is 
shortage of glucose).
37. What are the effects of 
somatostatin for the 
pancreatic hormonal 
secretion?
Somatostatin inhibits both insulin and 
glucagon secretions.

Biology Questions and Answers
38. What is diabetes mellitus?
Diabetes mellitus is the disease caused 
by deficient production or action of 
insulin and the consequent low glucose 
uptake by the cells and high blood 
glucose level.
39. What are the three main 
signs of diabetes?
The three main signs of diabetes 
mellitus are known as the diabetic triad: 
polyuria, polydipsia and polyphagia.
Polyuria is the excessive elimination of 
urine; in diabetes it is caused by 
reduced water resorption in the renal 
tubules due to increased osmolarity of 
the glomerular filtrate (caused by 
excessive glucose). Polydipsia is the 
exaggerated ingestion of water; the 
thirst is due to the excessive water loss 
in the urine. Polyphagia is the 
exaggerated ingestion of food caused by 
deficiency in energy generation by 
glucose-lacking cells.
40. Why do diabetic patients 
often undergo dietary sugar 
restriction? What are the main 
complications of diabetes 
mellitus?
Diabetic patients are often advised to 
ingest less carbohydrates since these 
substances are degraded into glucose 
and this molecule is absorbed in the 
intestines. The dietary sugar restriction 
goal is to control glycemia to maintain it 
at normal levels.
The main complications of diabetes are 
tissue injuries that occur in vaious 
organs caused by the chronic increased 
blood osmolarity: in the peripheral 
nerves (diabetic neuropathy), resulting 
in sensitivity loss, increased wounds 
(the person does not feel that the tissue 
is being wounded and the wound 
expands) and muscle fatigue; in the 
kidneys (diabetic nephropathy), causing 
glomerular lesions that may lead to 
renal failure; in the retina (diabetic 
retinopathy), leading to vision 
impairment and blindness; in the skin, 
as a consequence of the neuropathy. 
Diabetes mellitus also is one of the 
major risk factors for cardiovascular 
diseases like embolism, myocardial 
infarction and stroke.
41. What is the difference 
between type I diabetes 
mellitus and type II diabetes 
mellitus?
Type I diabetes, also known as juvenile 
diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes 
(this name is not adequate as type II 
diabetes may become insulin-
dependent), is the impaired production 
of insulin by the pancreas believed to be 
caused by destruction of cells of the 
islets of Langerhans by autoantibodies 
(autoimmunity).
Type II diabetes occurs in the adult 
individual and it is often diagnosed in 
people of more advanced age. In type II 
diabetes there is normal or low 
secretion of insulin by the pancreas but 
the main cause of the high glycemia is 
the peripheral resistance of the cells to 
the action of the hormone.

Biology Questions and Answers
42. In ancient Greece the 
father of Medicine, 
Hypocrates, described a 
method of diagnosing diabetes 
mellitus by tasting the 
patient's urine. What is the 
physiological explanation for 
this archaic method?
Under normal conditions the glucose 
filtered by the renal glomeruli is almost 
entirely resorbed in the nephron tubules 
and not excreted in urine. With the 
elevated glucose blood level the renal 
tubules cannot resorb all the filtered 
glucose and some amount of the 
substance appears in the urine. This 
amount is enough to provide the sweet 
taste that helped Hypocrates to 
diagnose diabetes and to differentiate it 
from other diseases accompanied by 
polyuria. Nowadays the method is 
inconceivable due to the danger of 
contamination of the tester by disease 
agents possibly present in the patient's 
urine.
43. What are the main 
treatments of diabetes 
mellitus?
The general goal of the diabetes 
treatment is to maintain normal 
glycemic levels.
Type I diabetes is treated with 
parenteral administration of insulin. 
Insulin must be administered 
intravenously or intramuscularly 
because as a protein it would be 
digested if ingested orally. In type II 
diabetes treatment is done with oral 
drugs that regulate the glucose 
metabolism or in more severe cases 
with parenteral administration of insulin. 
The moderation of carbohydrate 
ingestion is an important aid to diabetes 
treatment.
The diabetes treatment with the use of 
hypoglycemic agents, like insulin or oral 
medicines, must be carefully and 
medically supervised since if wrongly 
used these drugs may abruptly decrease 
the glucose blood level, cause 
hypoglycemia and even death.
Many other forms of diabetes treatment 
are under research worldwide.
44. How can bacteria produce 
human insulin on an industrial 
scale? What are the other 
forms of insulin made 
available by the 
pharmaceutical industry?
Bacteria do not naturally synthesize 
insulin. It is possible however to implant 
human genetic material containing the 
insulin gene into the bacterial DNA. The 
mutant bacteria then multiply and 
produce human insulin. The insulin is 
isolated and purified for later 
commercialization. This biotechnology is 
known as the recombinant DNA 
technology.
Besides human insulin the 
pharmaceutical industry also produces 
insulin to be used by humans made 
from the pancreas of pigs and cows.

45. Where are the adrenal 
glands located? How many are 
they and what are their 
portions?
Each adrenal gland is located on the top 
of each kidney (forming a hat-like 
structure for the kidneys), so there are 
two glands. The adrenal parenchymal 
structure is divided into two portions: 
the most peripheral is the cortical 
portion, or adrenal cortex, and the 
central is the medullary portion, or 
adrenal medulla.
46. What are the hormones 
secreted by the adrenal 
medulla? What are their 
respective functions?
The medullary portion of the adrenals 
secretes hormones of the catecholamine 
group: adrenaline (also known as 
epinephrine) and noradrenaline (also 
known as norepinephrine). Besides their 
hormonal function, adrenaline and 
noradrenaline act as neurotransmitters 
too. The neurons that use them as 
neurotransmitters are called adrenergic 
neurons.
Adrenaline increases the glycogen 
breaking into glucose (glycogenolysis) 
thus increasing glycemia and the basal 
metabolic rate of the body. Adrenaline 
and noradrenaline are released during 
situations of danger (fightfight or flight 
response) and they intensify the 
strength and rate of the heartbeat and 
selectively modulate the blood irrigation 
in some tissues by selective vasodilation 
and selective vasoconstriction. By 
vasodilation they increase the blood 
supply to the brain, the muscles and the 
heart and by vasoconstriction they 
reduce the blood supply to the kidneys, 
the skin and the gastrointestinal tract.
Substances like adrenaline and 
noradrenaline that promote vasodilation 
or vasoconstriction are called vasoactive 
substances.
47. What are the hormones 
secreted by the adrenal 
cortex? What are their 
respective functions?
The cortical portion of the adrenals 
secretes hormones of the corticoid (or 
corticosteroid) group, derived from 
cholesterol: glucocorticoid, 
mineralocorticoids and cortical sex 
hormones.
The glucocorticoids are cortisol and 
cortisone. The glucocorticoids stimulate 
the formation of glucose from the 
degradation of proteins of the muscle 
tissue (gluconeogenesis) and so they 
help to increase glycemia. These 
hormones play an important 
immunosuppressant role, i.e., they 
reduce the action of the immune system 
and for this reason they are used as 
medicine to treat inflammatory and 
autoimmune diseases and rejection of 
transplanted organs.
The mineralocorticoids aldosterone and 
deoxycorticosterone regulate the 
sodium and potassium blood 
concentration and thus they control the 
water level of the extracellular space. 
Aldosterone increases the sodium 
resorption and thus the water resorption 
in the renal tubules and it also

stimulates the renal excretion of 
potassium and hydrogen.
The adrenal cortical sex hormones are 
androgens, male sex hormones present 
in men and women. In men their main 
site of production is the testicle and 
they promote the appearance of 
secondary male sex characteristics, like 
body hair and beard, deep voice, the 
male pattern of fat distribution and 
maturation of the genitalia. If 
abnormally high in women they cause 
inhibited maturation of the female 
genitalia and disturbances of the 
menstrual cycle.
48. Why are glucorticoids 
used in transplant patients?
Patients with transplanted organs are 
prone to host versus graft rejection 
since their own immune system tends to 
attack the grafted organ because of 
recognition of the grafted tissue as 
foreign matter. In the prevention and 
treatment of this common problem 
patients are given glucorticoids or other 
immunosupressants. Glucocorticoids 
have an immunosuppressant action and 
so they reduce the aggression of the 
immune system against the graft.
The immune action however is also very 
important for the individual. The 
immune system defends the body 
against invasion and infection by 
pathogenic agents (virus, bacteria, 
toxins) besides being fundamental for 
the elimination of modified cells that 
may proliferate and cause cancer. 
Patients receiving immunosuppressants 
like glucocorticoids are thus under 
increased risk of infectious and 
neoplastic diseases.
49. What are the hormones 
produced by the testicles and 
the ovaries?
The testicles make androgenic 
hormones, the main of them being 
testosterone. The ovaries produce 
estrogen and progesterone.
50. What is the endocrine 
function of the placenta?
The placenta is not a permanent gland 
of the endocrine system but it also has 
endocrinal function. The placenta 
produces estrogen and progesterone. It 
also secretes human chorionic 
gonadotropin (HCG, that acts similarly 
to the hypophyseal LH), human 
placental lactogen, similar to prolactin 
and stimulant of the mammary glands, 
and a series of hormonal peptides 
similar to the hormones of the 
hypothalamus-hypophysis axis.

Biology Questions and Answers
Immune System
1. What is the function of the 
immune system?
The immune system performs specific 
defense against agents, the antigens, 
that are foreign or harmful to the body.
Exogenous antigens are often in contact 
with the skin or entering the airway, the 
digestive tube and the genital orifices 
and mucosae. They can also penetrate 
the circulation directly through wounds.
2. What are the two groups of 
defense mechanisms of the 
body against foreign or 
harmful agents? What is the 
difference between them?
The body has many defense 
mechanisms against foreign pathogenic 
agents. These mechanisms are divided 
into two groups: the specific 
mechanisms and the unspecific 
mechanisms. The specific mechanisms 
are part of the immune system and 
comprehend the humoral immune 
response and the cellular immune 
response that respectively produce 
antibodies and defense cells against 
specific antigens. The unspecific 
mechanisms fight in a general manner 
any type of antigen (they do not have 
specificity) and in them a series of 
defense means are included, like the 
skin barrier against foreign agents, the 
mucous and ciliated epithelium of the 
airway, inflammation (the inflammatory 
response) and the action of unspecific 
proteins and defense cells (e.g., 
interferons and macrophages).
3. What is inflammation?
Inflammation is the initial response of 
the unspecific defense system versus 
aggressions against the body (the 
aggressions may be caused by 
infectious parasites, chemical 
contamination, trauma, physical agents 
like heat and fire, autoimmunity, etc.). 
During inflammation a series of 
unspecific leukocytes present in the 
circulation are attracted to the injury 
site in an attempt to destroy harmful 
agents and to isolate the affected region 
of the tissue.
4. How does the inflammation 
mechanism work?
When some tissue injury occurs 
histamine and other vasoactive 
substances (called mediators of 
inflammation) are released, they cause 
vasodilation and the blood flow to the 
affected site increases. Granulocyte 
leukocytes present in the blood are 
attracted to the site of the injury by 
substances known as chemotactic 
factors also released by the injured 
tissue and by the active granulocytes in 
the area. The granulocytes exit the 
capillaries by diapedesis, i.e., using 
pseudopods. Macrophages present in 
the region are activated too. These cells 
flood the extracellular space of the 
affected area trying to kill or eliminate 
harmful agents, to prevent tissue

necrosis and to isolate the damaged 
tissue.
5. What is pus?
Pus is a residual of the inflammatory 
reaction. It contains a mixture of 
fragments of dead leukocytes, infectious 
agents (generally bacteria) and tissues.
6. What is the association 
between inflammation and 
fever?
In the tissue region where inflammation 
occurs bacterial toxins, cytokines, 
prostaglandins, interleukins and 
endothelins are released. These 
substances gain the circulation and 
reach the central nervous system which 
then commands the increase of the 
body temperature.
7. Which type of defense cell 
do bacteria attract and cause 
to multiply during the 
inflammation process? What is 
the name given to the waste 
material produced by the 
inflammation triggered by 
bacterial infection?
The main leukocytes that generally 
multiply and participate in the 
inflammation reaction against bacterial 
infections are the neutrophils. In this 
type of inflammation the blood level of 
these cells are increased, a clinical 
condition known as neutrophilia.
In the bacterial inflammation fragments 
of dead bacteria, dead neutrophils and 
tissues form the pus.
8. Of which type of defense 
cell do worm infections 
stimulate the multiplication?
The main leukocytes that generally 
multiply and participate in the defense 
against worm infections are the 
eosinophils. In this type of inflammation 
the blood level of these cells are 
increased, a clinical condition known as 
eosinophilia.
Eosinophils are also increased in allergic 
conditions.
9. Of which type of defense 
cell do viral infections 
stimulate the multiplication?
The main leukocytes that generally 
multiply and participate in the defense 
against viral infections are the 
lymphocytes. In this type of 
inflammation the blood level of these 
cells are increased, a clinical condition 
known as lymphocytosis.
10. What is the defense 
mechanism that begins to 
work when inflammation fails 
to stop an infection?

Biology Questions and Answers
If the inflammatory attack is not enough 
to halt the infectious process the body 
still relies on a specific defense, the 
immune response proper (humoral and 
cellular) performed by the lymphocytes.
11. What is the difference 
between humoral specific 
immune response and cellular 
specific immune response?
Humoral specific immune response is 
the defense system by means of 
antibodies, defense proteins secreted by 
lymphocytes that attack foreign agents 
with high specificity. Cellular specific 
immune response is the defense system 
by means of specific lymphocytes (cells) 
that directly attack other foreign cells 
and agents.
12. What is an antigen?
Antigen is any substance, particle or 
infectious agent recognized as foreign to 
the body. The contact of the antigen 
with the body promotes a defense 
reaction against the antigen (unspecific, 
specific or both).
13. What are the cells 
responsible for the production 
of antibodies?
The cells that produce antibodies, i.e., 
the cells of the humoral immune 
system, are the B lymphocytes (B cells).
14. What are 
immunoglobulins?
Immunoglobulin is the alternate name 
given to antibody. Immunoglobulins are 
complex proteins containing an 
invariable portion and a variable portion 
and made of four polypeptide chains. 
The variable portion of each 
immunoglobulin is responsible for the 
high specificity of the antigen-antibody 
bond.
15. How do antibodies work to 
neutralize antigens?
The antibodies, or immunoglobulins, act 
to facilitate the destruction of antigens: 
they attract phagocytic leukocytes, they 
trigger the attack of specific defense 
molecules (activation of the complement 
system) and they directly neutralize the 
toxicity of some antigens.
16. How can an organism that 
once underwent contact with 
an antigen be immunized 
against future infections by 
the same agent?
This phenomenon is called immune 
memory. When an antigen makes 
contact for the first time with cells of 
the humoral immune system, B 
lymphocytes that are producers of 
specific immunoglobulins against that 
antigen multiply and in days synthesize 
their antibodies. This is called primary 
response. Some of these specific B 
lymphocytes remain in the circulation 
for a long time, sometimes during the

Biology Questions and Answers
entire life of the individual, and they 
become the memory cells of the 
immune system. When the body is 
exposed in the future to the same 
antigen the production of antibodies will 
be faster and more intense since the 
immune system is already prepared to 
react against that antigen. This is called 
the secondary response.
17. How can the immune 
memory lead to the efficacy of 
vaccines and also produce 
allergies?
Vaccines are controlled inoculations of 
fragments of infectious agents or of 
inactive infectious agents to induce the 
primary immune response, the 
formation of specific memory B 
lymphocytes against the antigen. 
Therefore the organism produces 
immunoglobulins and becomes prepared 
to destroy antigens when exposed to 
new infections by those agents.
In allergies the humoral immune system 
is sensitized (makes antibodies and 
specific memory B lymphocytes) against 
some common environmental 
substances wrongly recognized as 
antigens. For example, pollen-derived 
substances, dust particles, compounds 
present in foods or in medicines, etc. 
may be recognized as antigens 
triggering the primary response and 
creating an immune memory against 
them that then become causes of 
allergy. The more the individual is 
exposed to those substances the more 
intense is the immune reaction.
The IgE antibodies that cause allergy 
bind to receptors of leukocytes called 
mastocytes whose cytoplasm is full of 
histamine granules. The antibody-
mastocyte bond causes these cells to 
release a great amount of histamine in 
the circulation, stimulating inflammation 
and generating the allergic symptoms 
and signs. For this reason allergy is 
treated with antihistamines, drugs that 
block the histaminic reaction. 
Exacerbated allergic reactions, for 
example, in hypersensitivity to some 
medicines like penicillin and sulfas, may 
cause anaphylactic shock, a severe 
clinical condition that sometimes leads 
to death.
18. How different are the 
actions of antibodies against 
bacteria and against virus? 
Why is the cellular immune 
response activated in case of 
chronic viral infection?
The antibodies of the humoral immune 
system act against extracellular agents, 
like toxins or bacteria, but they are not 
active in the intracellular space and they 
cannot fight virus efficiently.
In case of viral infection (and also of 
cancerous or precancerous cells) the 
immune attack is made by the cellular 
immune system, mediated by T and NK 
(natural killers) lymphocytes that 
destroy specific cells and virus.
19. How does the cellular 
immune response take place?
The lymphocytes that participate in the 
cellular immune response are the T

Biology Questions and Answers
lymphocytes. T lymphocytes 
differentiate into three main types: 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (cytotoxic T 
cell), helper T lymphocytes (helper cell) 
and suppressor T lymphocytes. The 
cytotoxic cells are the effectors of the 
system, i.e., they directly attack other 
cells recognized as foreign (for example, 
fungi cells, cells infected by virus, 
neoplastic cells, graft cells, etc.). The 
helper cells and the suppressor T 
lymphocytes act as regulators of the 
system releasing substances that 
respectively stimulate and inhibit the 
immune action of T and B lymphocytes. 
After the primary immune response 
memory T lymphocytes also remain in 
the circulation to provide faster and 
more effective reaction in case of future 
infections.
20. What are the antigen-
presenting cells of the 
immune system?
The antigen-presenting cells of the 
immune system, also known as APC 
cells, are cells that do phagocytosis and 
digestion of foreign (to the body) 
microorganisms and later expose 
antigens derived from these 
microorganisms in the outer side of 
their plasma membrane. These 
processed antigens are then recognized 
by lymphocytes that activate the 
immune response. Several types of 
cells, like the macrophages, can act as 
antigen-presenting cells.
21. What are passive and 
active immunization? 
According to the duration of 
the protection how do these 
types of immunization differ?
Active immunization is that in which an 
antigen penetrates the body triggering 
the primary immune response and the 
production of memory lymphocytes and 
antibodies that provide faster and more 
effective immune defense in future 
infections by the same antigen. Passive 
immunization is that in which 
immunoglobulins against an antigen are 
inoculated in the body to provide 
protection in case the body becomes 
infected by the antigen.
Active immunization tends to be longer 
lasting than passive immunization since 
in the active type as well as antibodies, 
specific memory lymphocytes remain in 
the circulation. In the passive 
immunization the duration of the 
protection is that of the duration of the 
antibodies in the circulation.
22. Why is maternal milk 
important for the immune 
protection of the baby?
Besides being nutritionally important, 
maternal milk participates in the 
defense of the baby against infectious 
agents. Soon after delivery the mother 
produces a more fluid milk called 
colostrum that is rich in 
immunoglobulins (antibodies). These 
antibodies are not absorbed by the 
baby’s circulation but they cover the 
internal surface of the baby’s bowels 
thus attacking possible antigens and

making more difficult the proliferation of 
pathogenic bacteria within the organ.
23. How are antivenoms 
produced? Why are 
antivenoms an example of 
passive immunization?
Antivenoms are obtained by the 
following process: the venom (antigen) 
is inoculated into other mammals, e.g., 
in horses; these animals make specific 
antibodies against the antigen; blood 
from the animals is collected and 
purified to get the antibodies; this 
antibody-containing material is the 
antivenom. When a human being is 
infected by the antigen the specific 
antivenom is given to him/her and the 
action against the antigen occurs.
Antivenoms may also be administered 
as a preventive measure and, since it is 
basically made of specific 
immunoglobulins against some antigen, 
the process is an example of passive 
immunization.
24. What is the difference 
between homologous and 
heterologous 
immunoglobulins?
Homologous immunoglobulin is the 
human (from the same species) 
immunoglobulin. In case of inoculation 
in animals as in veterinary procedures 
homologous immunoglobulin is that 
from the blood of animals of the same 
species of the animal undergoing 
treatment. Heterologous 
immunoglobulin is that obtained from 
animals of different species from the 
individual into which it will be 
inoculated.
The homologous immunoglobulin is 
safer since it is collected from beings of 
the same species of the individual in 
which it will be inoculated and thus the 
risk of the antibodies to be recognized 
as foreign and to trigger an immune 
response is lower. Heterologous 
immunoglobulins are more prone to 
being destroyed by the own antibodies 
of the individual.
25. What are natural active 
immunization and artificial 
active immunization?
Natural active immunization is that in 
which a previous natural infection 
induces the primary immune response, 
specific memory cells are produced and 
the individual becomes immune to new 
infections with the antigen. This is what 
happens in diseases that affect people 
only once in life, like mumps and 
chickenpox.
Artificial active immunization is that in 
which the primary immune response is 
caused by the inoculation into an 
individual of specially prepared 
antigens. This is the case with vaccines.
26. Why are vaccines made of 
the own disease agent or of 
fragments of it?
The goal of vaccines is to artificially 
induce a specific primary immune

response (and the consequent formation 
of antibodies and memory cells) 
concerning a given infection or disease 
in order to immunize the individual 
against infections by the pathogenic 
agent in the future.
Since each antibody does not act 
against a variety of antigens but instead 
it acts only against its specific antigen, 
it is necessary for the immune system 
to make contact in some way with the 
antigen against which the immunization 
is wanted. The reconnaissance of 
specific molecular portions of each 
antigen causes the immune system to 
produce the specific variable portion of 
the immunoglobulins to attack that 
antigen. Therefore to induce the active 
immunization it is necessary to 
inoculate into the body small parts of 
the infectious agent or the agent 
entirely (dead or inactivated).
27. What are the types of 
antigenic agents that may 
constitute vaccines?
Vaccines can be constituted of dead 
agents of disease, of inactivated agents 
of disease, of inactivated toxins or of 
fragments of the infectious agent.
Examples of some vaccines and their 
type of antigenic agents are: BCG, 
inactivated tuberculosis bacilli; 
antitetanic vaccine, inactivated toxin; 
antidiphtheric, inactivated toxin; 
antipolio Salk, dead poliovirus; antipolio 
Sabin, attenuated (inactivated) 
poliovirus.
28. Why doesn't a long lasting 
vaccine against common cold 
exist yet?
Viruses that present a high mutation 
rate like the virus that causes the 
common cold escape easily from the 
action of vaccines against them. After a 
primary immune response (natural or 
artificially induced) against the virus in 
the next season of infection new mutant 
resistant strains appear and the 
protection obtained with the immune 
response of the last season is lost. (One 
could say that the high mutation rate is 
a form of “immunization” found by 
these viruses.)
29. Why are vaccines used in 
the prevention but not in the 
treatment of infections? Why 
can antivenom serums be 
used in prevention and 
treatment?
Vaccines are not used in the treatment 
of infections because they depend on 
the primary immune response that 
takes about a week to occur and is not 
so intense and effective. Antivenom 
serums however are inoculated into the 
circulation and used as an immediate 
treatment because they are made of a 
great amount of immunoglobulin 
(antibodies) which is potent against 
their respective specific venom.
30. What is the DNA vaccine?
The DNA vaccine, or DNA vaccination, is 
a vaccination technology based on

genetic engineering. In DNA vaccination 
a recombinant plasmid (vector) 
containing the gene of a specific antigen 
that is part of a given pathogenic agent 
is inserted into cells of the individual to 
be immunized. These cells then begin to 
produce the antigen that triggers the 
primary immune response and 
theoretically the individual becomes 
immunized against that antigen.
31. What is the name given to 
conditions in which the own 
immune system of the 
individual is the agent of 
diseases? What are some 
examples of these conditions?
Diseases caused by the action of the 
own immune system of the individual 
are called autoimmune diseases.
The autoimmune diseases appear when 
the immune system makes antibodies or 
defense cells that attack cells, tissues 
and organs of its own body. The 
attacked cells or tissues are wrongly 
recognized as antigens by the immune 
system. Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, 
scleroderma, vitiligo, pemphigus, type I 
diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease 
(chronic inflammation of the gut), 
myasthenia gravis, Graves disease, 
Hashimoto's disease, etc., are all 
examples of autoimmune diseases.

Biology Questions and Answers
Gametogenesis
1. What are gametes?
Gametes are cells specialized in sexual 
reproduction. They contain half of the 
maximum number of chromosomes of 
the species and unite with another 
gamete giving birth to a zygote with 
double of the number of chromosomes 
of the gametic cells.
In humans gametes are formed by 
meiosis; the male gametes are the 
sperm cells and the female gametes are 
the egg cells.
2. What is the type of cell 
division that allows sexual 
reproduction? What is 
gametogenesis?
Meiosis is the type of cell division that 
allows sexual reproduction since it 
reduces to a half the number of 
chromosomes of the species making 
possible the combination of two 
gametes to form a new individual. (In 
some beings meiosis creates haploid 
gametophytes that by means of mitosis 
generate gametes. Even in this case the 
function of meiosis is the same: to 
provide cells with half of the number of 
chromosomes of the species with 
separation of the homologous.)
Gametogenesis is the name given to the 
process of gamete production.
3. What is the name of the 
cells capable of making 
gametes? What is the ploidy 
of these gamete-forming 
cells?
The cells that form gametes are the 
germ cells as opposed to the somatic 
cells. The ploidy (number of 
chromosomes) of the germ cells is the 
same as the somatic cells (only during 
the formation of gametes meiosis occurs 
and the number of chromosomes is 
reduced to half).
4. What are gonads? What are 
the male and the female 
gonads in humans?
Gonads are the organs that produce 
gametes. They contain the germ cells 
that undergo division and generate 
gametes. In males the gonads are the 
testicles. In females the gonads are the 
ovaries.
5. Indicating the name and 
respective ploidy of each 
involved cell how can the 
formation of sperm cells from 
germ cells be described?
The formation of sperm cells, or 
spermatogenesis, begins with a germ 
cell called spermatogonium (2n) that 
suffers mitosis and gives birth to the 
spermatocyte I (2n). The spermatocyte 
I undergoes meiosis I and generates 
two spermatocyte II (n) that then

undergo meiosis II and produce four 
spermatids (n). Each spermatid 
undergoes a maturation process called 
spermiogenesis and four sperm cells 
appear.
6. What is the difference 
between spermatogonium and 
spermatocyte I?
The male germ cells are the 
spermatogonia (diploid cells, 2n) 
situated in the testicles. They mature 
and by means of mitosis give birth to 
spermatocytes I (2n) that will undergo 
meiosis.
7. What is the difference 
between spermatocyte I and 
spermatocyte II?
The spermatocyte I (2n) undergoes the 
first division of meiosis (meiosis I) 
originating two spermatocyte II 
(haploid, n).
8. What is the difference 
between spermatocyte II and 
spermatid?
The spermatids (n) are the products of 
the second division of meiosis (meiosis 
II) in the male gametogenesis. Each 
spermatocyte II originates two 
spermatids totaling four spermatids for 
each spermatocyte I that enter meiosis.
9. What is the difference 
between spermatids and 
sperm cells? What is the name 
of the transformation of 
spermatids into sperm cells?
Sperm cells (the male gametes) are 
matured spermatids that have already 
undergone differentiation (appearance 
of the flagellum, reduction of the 
cytoplasm, formation of the acrosome, 
increase in the number of 
mitochondria). This differentiation 
process is called spermiogenesis.
10. What is the acrosome of 
the sperm cell? How is it 
formed?
The acrosome is a structure that 
contains a great number of digestive 
enzymes, it is located in the anterior 
end of the sperm cell and it is formed by 
the union of Golgi apparatus vesicles. 
The function of the acrosome is to 
release its enzymes when the sperm cell 
meets the egg cell to break the external 
covering of the female gamete thus 
making fecundation possible.
11. What is the function of the 
flagellum of the sperm cell? 
How is it formed?
The flagellum of the sperm cell is made 
by the centrioles that migrate to the 
region posterior to the nucleus. Its 
function is to promote locomotion 
towards the egg cell.

Biology Questions and Answers
12. Why is the cytoplasm of 
sperm cells very reduced? 
Why do mitochondria of sperm 
cells concentrate in the base 
of the flagellum?
The reduced cytoplasm of sperm cells 
decreases the cell weight and provides a 
more hydrodynamic shape for the 
locomotion in fluids.
The high concentration of mitochondria 
at the base of the flagellum of the 
sperm cell is necessary for the energetic 
supply of the flagellum (for it to beat 
and move the sperm cell).
13. Concerning events during 
the periods of life how 
different is the gametogenesis 
in women and in men?
The formation of spermatogonia in men 
takes place during the embryonic 
period. The formation of sperm cells 
however is a continuous process that 
begins in puberty and goes on until old 
age and sometimes during all the 
remaining life of the man.
In women all oogonia are formed before 
birth. The oogonia turn into oocytes I 
that enter the first division of meiosis 
(meiosis I). This division however is 
interrupted at prophase and continues 
only in puberty. After the beginning of 
menses an egg cell is released during 
each period and, if fecundated, it 
finishes the meiotic division. The 
oogenesis stops after menopause 
(cessation of the menstrual activity) and 
the climacteric period of life begins.
14. Indicating the name and 
respective ploidy of each 
involved cell how can the 
formation of egg cells from 
germ cells be described?
The formation of egg cells begins with a 
germ cell called oogonium (2n) that 
undergoes mitosis and gives birth to the 
oocyte I (2n). The oocyte I undergoes 
meiosis I that however is interrupted at 
prophase. After puberty during each 
menstrual cycle an oocyte I finishes the 
meiosis I and generate one oocyte II (n) 
and the first polar body (n). With 
fecundation the oocyte II then 
undergoes meiosis II and produces the 
mature egg cell (n) and the second 
polar body (n).
15. What is the first polar 
body? How different is it from 
the oocyte II?
In oogenesis the oogonium 
differentiates into oocyte I (2n) and this 
cell enters meiosis. After finishing the 
first meiotic division (meiosis I) the 
oocyte I forms two cells: the oocyte II 
(n) and the first polar body. The oocyte 
II is bigger because it gets almost all 
the cytoplasm and the cytoplasmic 
structures of the oocyte I as a strategy 
for metabolite and nutrient storage. The 
oocyte II cell goes then to the second 
meiotic division. The first polar body is 
very small and almost lacks cytoplasm; 
it disintegrates or stays attached to the 
oocyte II.

16. What is the relation 
between fecundation and the 
end of the meiotic process 
during oogenesis?
The oocyte II only completes the second 
meiotic division (interrupted at 
metaphase) if fecundation by a male 
gamete occurs. (One can say therefore 
that in fact the female gamete is the 
oocyte II).
17. What is the second polar 
body?
After termination of the second meiotic 
division of the oocyte II two cells are 
generated: the egg cell proper and the 
second polar body. The second polar 
body is a very small cell that almost 
lacks cytoplasm and stays adnexal to 
the egg cell. The entire cytoplasmic 
content of the oocyte II passes to the 
egg cell.
18. What is the relationship 
between the menstrual cycle 
and ovulation?
Ovulation is the releasing of the female 
gamete from the ovary. Ovulation is a 
periodical event that occurs during each 
menstrual cycle. Considering as the first 
day of the menstrual cycle the day when 
menses begins, the ovulation occurs 
around the 14th day when the 
concentrations of the hormones LH and 
FSH reach high levels.
19. How does the male 
gamete penetrate the egg 
cell? How does the female 
gamete protect itself from the 
entrance of more gametes 
after the entrance of the first 
sperm cell?
The sperm cell that reaches the egg cell 
triggers the acrosome reaction, a 
process in which hydrolytic enzymes of 
the acrosome are released on the 
external surface of the zona pellucida 
(the protective layer that surrounds the 
egg cell). A portion of this layer is 
digested by the acrosomal enzymes 
allowing the sperm cell to reach the 
plasma membrane of the egg cell 
carrying out fecundation.
At the moment that the sperm cell 
makes contact with the egg cell 
membrane a chemical alteration of this 
membrane occurs. Enzymes secreted by 
exocytosis (cortical reaction) make the 
zona pellucida unable to bind to other 
sperm cells (zonal reaction) and other 
male gametes cannot enter the egg cell.
20. What are the female 
pronucleus and the male 
pronucleus?
The female pronucleus is the proper 
haploid nucleus of the egg cell. Male 
pronucleus is the haploid nucleus of the 
sperm cell that has fecundated the egg 
cell. After fecundation both pronuclei 
fuse forming the nucleus of the diploid 
zygote.

Biology Questions and Answers
21. Concerning their size and 
basic morphology how and 
why do the male and the 
female gametes differentiate 
from each other?
The female gametes are big cells full of 
vitellus (nutritive material). The male 
gametes are small, mobile and agile 
flagellate cells.
Those features are related to their 
respective biological functions. While 
the female gametes have the basic 
functions of receiving the sperm cell 
nucleus and of storing nutrients for the 
zygote, the male gametes have the 
function of active movement towards 
the egg cell.

Biology Questions and Answers
Reproductive 
System
1. What are the organs that 
are part of the male genital 
system?
The organs that comprise the male 
genital system are the testicles, the 
epididymides, the vas deferens, the 
seminal vesicles, the ejaculatory duct, 
the prostate, the bulbourethral glands, 
the urethra and the penis.
2. Concerning reproduction 
what is the function of the 
testicles?
The testicles are the male gonads, i.e., 
the organs where the production of 
gametes takes place. In human beings 
the gametes are made by meiosis that 
occur in the testicles.
3. After passing the 
epididymides through which 
structures do sperm cells go 
until exteriorization?
After leaving the epididymis in the 
testicle sperm cells enter the vas 
deferens, after that they receive 
secretions from the seminal vesicles and 
gather (from right and left sides) in the 
ejaculatory duct that passes inside the 
prostate. They also get secretions from 
the prostate and the bulbourethral 
glands and then go through the urethra, 
inside the penis, to the exterior.
4. What is the function of the 
secretions of the prostate, 
seminal vesicle and 
bulbourethral glands in 
reproduction?
These secretions along with sperm cells 
from the testicles form the semen. The 
secretions have the function of 
nourishing the sperm cells and serving 
them as a fluid means of propagation. 
The basic pH of the seminal fluid also 
neutralizes the acid secretions of the 
vagina allowing the survival of sperm 
cells in the vaginal environment after 
copulation.
5. What are the endocrine 
glands that regulate sexual 
activity in males? How does 
this regulation work and what 
are the involved hormones?
In males the sexual activity is regulated 
by the endocrine glands hypophysis 
(pituitary), adrenals and gonads 
(testicles).
The FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) 
secreted by the adenohypophysis acts 
upon the testicles stimulating the 
spermatogenesis. The LH (luteinizing 
hormone), another adenohypophyseal 
hormone, stimulates the production of 
testosterone by the testicles too. 
Testosterone, whose production

intensifies after the beginning of 
puberty, acts in several organs of the 
body and it is responsible for the 
appearing of the male secondary sex 
characteristics (beard, body hair, deep 
voice, increase of the muscle and 
osseous mass, maturation of genitalia, 
etc.) Testosterone also stimulates 
spermatogenesis.
6. What are the organs that 
are part of the female 
reproductive system?
The organs that constitute the female 
reproductive system are the ovaries, the 
Fallopian tubes (or uterine tubes), the 
uterus, the vagina and the vulva.
7. In which period of life does 
the formation of gametes 
begin in women?
The meiosis that forms female gametes 
begins in the cells of the ovarian follicles 
before birth. After the beginning of 
puberty, under hormonal stimuli, during 
each menstrual cycle one of the cells is 
released on the surface of the ovary and 
meiosis resumes. The meiotic process is 
only concluded however if fecundation 
happens.
8. What is the organ that 
releases the female gamete 
under formation? How is this 
release triggered? What is the 
organ that collects the 
released gametes?
The organ that liberates the female 
gamete is the ovary, the female gonad. 
The releasing of the oocyte is a 
response to hormonal stimuli. The 
immature egg cell (still an oocyte) falls 
into the abdominal cavity and is picked 
up by the Fallopian tube (uterine tube, 
or oviduct), a tubular structure that 
connects the ovary with the uterus.
9. What are the anatomical 
relationships between the 
organs of the female 
reproductive system from the 
external vulva to the ovaries?
The external female genitalia is called 
the vulva. The vulva is the external 
opening of the vaginal canal, or vagina. 
The vagina is the copulation organ of 
the females and its posterior extremity 
communicates with the uterus through 
the uterine cervix. The uterus is divided 
into two portions: the cervix and the 
uterine cavity. The lateral walls of the 
uterine fundus communicate with the 
Fallopian tubes. The other extremity of 
each Fallopian tube ends in fimbria 
forming fringes in the abdominal cavity. 
Between the uterine tube and the ovary 
there is still intra-abdominal space.

Biology Questions and Answers
10. What is the menstrual 
cycle?
The menstrual cycle is the periodic 
succession of interactions between 
hormones and the organs of the female 
reproductive system that, after the 
beginning of puberty, regulates the 
release of the female gametes and 
prepares the uterus for fecundation and 
pregnancy.
11. What are the endocrine 
glands involved in the 
menstrual cycle? What are the 
hormones in action?
The endocrine glands that secrete 
hormones involved in the menstrual 
cycle are the hypophysis (pituitary) and 
the ovaries.
The hormones from adenohypophysis 
are FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) 
and LH (luteinizing hormone) and the 
hormones from the ovaries are estrogen 
and progesterone.
12. What event marks the 
beginning of the menstrual 
cycle? What is the blood 
concentration of FSH, LH, 
estrogen and progesterone in 
this phase of the cycle?
By convention the menstrual cycle 
begins at the day that menses begins. 
(Menses is the endometrial hemorrhage 
excreted through the vaginal canal.) At 
these days the hormones FSH, LH, 
estrogens and progesterone are in low 
concentration.
13. After menses what is the 
hormone that influences the 
maturation of the ovarian 
follicles?
The maturation of the ovarian follicles 
after menses is stimulated by the action 
of FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone).
14. What is the hormone 
secreted by the growing 
ovarian follicles? What is the 
action of that hormone upon 
the uterus?
The follicles that are growing after 
menses secrete estrogen. These 
hormones act upon the uterus 
stimulating the thickening of the 
endometrium (the internal mucosa of 
the uterus).
15. What is the relationship 
between the estrogen level 
and the LH level in the 
menstrual cycle? What is the 
function of LH in the 
menstrual cycle and when 
does its blood concentration 
reach a peak?
The increase in the blood concentration 
of estrogen with the growing of the 
ovarian follicle causes the hypophysis to 
secrete LH. In this phase LH acts

together with FSH promoting the 
maturation of the follicle that at the 
14th day ruptures releasing the female 
gamete (ovulation). After the release of 
the ovum LH acts stimulating the 
formation of the corpus luteum, a 
structure made from the remaining 
follicular mass. The LH concentration is 
at maximum at the 14th day of the 
cycle.
16. What are the hormones 
that promote the release of 
the female gamete from the 
follicle and at which day of the 
menstrual cycle does this 
phenomenon happen? What is 
this event called?
The hormones that promote the release 
of the ovum from the follicle are FSH 
and LH, hormones found in maximum 
blood concentration around the 14th 
day of the cycle. The release of the 
female gamete from the ovary is called 
ovulation. Ovulation happens at 
(around) the 14th day of the menstrual 
cycle.
17. How does the female 
gamete move from the ovary 
to the uterus?
The female gamete released from the 
ovary falls into the surrounding 
abdominal cavity and is collected by the 
Fallopian tube. The internal epithelium 
of the uterine tubes has ciliated cells 
that move the ovum or the fecundated 
egg cell towards the uterus.
18. How long after ovulation 
must fecundation occur to be 
effective?
If fecundation does not occur 
approximately 24 hours after ovulation 
the released ovum often dies.
19. What is the structure into 
which the follicle is 
transformed after ovulation? 
What is the importance of that 
structure in the menstrual 
cycle?
The follicle that released the ovum 
suffers the action of LH and is 
transformed into the corpus luteum. The 
corpus luteum is very important 
because it secretes estrogen and 
progesterone.
These hormones prepare the uterine 
mucosa, also known as endometrium, 
for nidation (implantation of the zygote 
in the uterine wall) and embryonic 
development since they stimulate the 
thickening of the mucous tissue, 
increase its vascularity and make the 
appearing of uterine glycogen-producing 
glands.
20. What is the importance of 
the uterine glycogen-
producing glands?
The uterine glands produce glycogen 
that can be degraded into glucose to 
nourish the embryo before the complete 
development of the placenta.

Biology Questions and Answers
21. How does the hypophysis-
corpus luteum negative 
feedback work? What is the 
name given to the atrophied 
corpus luteum after this 
feedback process?
After ovulation the estrogen and 
progesterone secretions from the corpus 
luteum inhibit the hypophyseal FSH and 
LH secretions (this happens by inhibition 
of GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone, a hypothalamic hormone). 
The blood concentration of these 
adenohypophyseal hormones falls to 
basal levels again. As LH lowers the 
corpus luteum (luteum means “yellow”) 
becomes atrophic and turns into the 
corpus albicans (“white”). With the 
regression of the corpus luteum the 
production of estrogen and 
progesterone ceases.
22. In hormonal terms why 
does menses occur?
Menses is the endometrial monthly 
desquamation that occurs as the 
estrogen and progesterone levels fall 
after the regression of the corpus 
luteum because these hormones, mainly 
progesterone, can no longer support 
and maintain the thickening of the 
endometrium.
23. What is the explanation 
for the bleeding that 
accompanies menses?
The hemorrhage that accompanies 
menses occurs because the 
endometrium is a richly vascularized 
tissue. The rupture of blood vessels of 
the uterine mucosa during the 
menstrual desquamation causes the 
bleeding.
24. Which are the phases of 
the menstrual cycle?
The menstrual cycle is divided into two 
main phases: the follicular (or 
menstrual) phase and the luteal (or 
secretory) phase.
The menstrual phase begins at the first 
day of menses and lasts until ovulation 
(around the 14th day). The luteal phase 
begins after ovulation and ends when 
menses begins (around the 28th day).
25. Including main events and 
hormonal changes how can 
the menstrual cycle be 
described?
One can imagine a cycle like an analog 
clock at which at 0 o’clock is the 
beginning and the end of the menstrual 
cycle and that 6 o’clock corresponds to 
the 14h day of the cycle.
At 0 o’clock the menses and so the 
menstrual cycle begins and FSH blood 
level begins to increase. Around 2 
o’clock the maturing follicles under FSH 
action are already secreting estrogen 
and the endometrium is thickening. 
Around 3 o’clock estrogen is intensely 
stimulating the increase of LH blood 
level. At 6 o’clock (the 14th day) LH is 
at its maximum concentration and FSH 
also at high levels to promote ovulation, 
www.biology-questions-and-answers.com
295
Buyer: Victoria Proctor (vicproc6@gmail.com)
Transaction ID: 4KS71350WY6468607

Biology Questions and Answers
LH then stimulates the formation of the 
corpus luteum. Around 7 o’clock the 
corpus luteum is already secreting a 
great amount of estrogen and 
progesterone and the endometrium 
thickens even more, concomitant 
lowering of FSH and LH occurs with the 
increasing of the ovarian hormones. 
Around 11 o’clock the reduced LH and 
FSH levels make the corpus luteum turn 
into the corpus albicans, the production 
of estrogen and progesterone ceases 
and the endometrium regresses. At 0 
o’clock again (28th day) the 
endometrium desquamates and a new 
menstrual cycle begins.
26. In general what is the 
phase of the menstrual cycle 
when copulation may lead to 
fecundation?
Although this is not a rule, to be 
effective fecundation in general must 
occur within about 24 hours after 
ovulation (that occurs around the 14th 
day of the menstrual cycle). 
Fecundation may occur even if 
copulation took place up to 3 days 
before ovulation since the male gametes 
remain viable for about 72 hours within 
the female reproductive system.
The fertile period of the women however 
is considered the period from 7 days 
before ovulation to 7 days after 
ovulation.
27. What is the part of the 
female reproductive system 
where fecundation occurs?
Fecundation generally occurs in the 
Fallopian tubes but it can also take 
place within the uterus. There are cases 
when fecundation may occur even 
before the ovum enters the uterine 
tube, a fact that may lead to a severe 
medical condition known as abdominal 
pregnancy.
28. How does the sexual 
arousal mechanism in women 
facilitate fecundation?
During sexual arousal in women the 
vagina secretes substances to neutralize 
its acidity thus allowing the survival of 
sperm cells within it. During the female 
fertile period hormones make the mucus 
that covers the internal surface of the 
uterus less viscous to help the passage 
of sperm cells to the uterine tubes. 
During copulation the uterine cervix 
advances inside the vagina to facilitate 
the entering of male gametes through 
the cervical canal.
29. What is nidation? In which 
phase of the menstrual cycle 
does nidation occur?
Nidation is the implantantion of the 
embryo in the uterus. Nidation occurs 
around the 7th day after fecundation, 
i.e., 7 to 8 days after ovulation 
(obviously, it occurs only if fecundation 
also occurs). Since it occurs in the luteal 
phase the progesterone level is high and

Biology Questions and Answers
the endometrium is in its best condition 
to receive the embryo.
30. What is tubal pregnancy?
Many times fecundation takes place in 
the Fallopian tubes. Generally the newly 
formed zygote is taken to the uterus 
where nidation and the embryonic 
development occur. In some cases 
however the zygote cannot go down to 
the uterus and the embryo implants 
itself in the uterine tube tissue, 
characterizing the tubal pregnancy. 
Tubal pregnancy is a severe clinical 
condition since often the tube ruptures 
during gestation causing hemorrhage 
and even death of the woman. The most 
common treatment for tubal pregnancy 
has been surgery.
31. How do hormonal tests to 
detect pregnancy work?
Laboratory tests to detect pregnancy 
commonly test for human chorionic 
gonadotropin (HCG) concentration in 
blood or urine samples. If the level of 
this hormone is abnormally high, 
pregnancy is likely.
32. Does the hypophysis-
ovaries endocrine axis work in 
the same way during 
pregnancy as in non-pregnant 
women? If pregnancy does 
not occur how does another 
menstrual cycle begin?
The functioning of the hypophysis is 
altered during pregnancy. Since 
estrogen and progesterone levels 
remain elevated during the gestational 
period the production of GnRH 
(gonadotropin-releasing hormone) from 
the hypothalamus is inhibited. The lack 
of GnRH thus inhibits the secretion of 
FSH and LH from the hypophysis and a 
new menstrual cycle does not begin.
If pregnancy does not occur the 
lowering of estrogen and progesterone 
levels stimulates the production of 
GnRH by the hypothalamus. This 
hormone then hastens the 
adenohypophyseal secretion of FHS and 
LH that in their turn stimulate the 
maturation of follicles and the beginning 
of a new menstrual cycle.
33. What is the endocrine 
function of the placenta?
The placenta besides being the organ 
through which the exchange of 
substances between the mother and the 
fetus is done also has the function of 
secreting estrogen and progesterone to 
keep a high level of these hormones 
during pregnancy. (The placenta still 
secretes other hormones like human 
placental lactogen, that act similarly to 
the hypophyseal hormones that regulate 
reproduction, and HCG, human 
chorionic gonadotropin.)
34. How do contraceptive pills 
generally work?
Contraceptive pills generally contain the 
hormones estrogen and progesterone. If

Biology Questions and Answers
taken daily from the 4th day after 
menses the abnormal elevation of these 
hormones acts upon the hypophysis-
hypothalamus endocrine axis inhibiting 
the FSH and LH secretions. Since these 
hormones then do not reach their 
normal high levels during the menstrual 
cycle ovulation does not occur.
(Treatment with contraceptive pills must 
be initiated under medical supervision.)
35. What are the common 
contraindications of the 
contraceptive pills?
There are medical reports associating 
the use of contraceptive pills with 
vomiting, nausea, vertigo, headaches, 
hypertension and other pathological 
conditions. Some research has 
attempted to relate the medical 
ingestion of estrogen and progesterone 
with increased propensity to 
cardiovascular diseases (like infarction, 
strokes and thrombosis) and to 
malignant neoplasias (cancers). Doctors 
must always be asked about the risks 
and benefits of the contraceptive pill 
prior to use.
36. What are the most 
common methods of male and 
female surgical sterilization?
Vasectomy is the most common method 
of surgical sterilization in men. In 
vasectomy the vas deferens inside the 
scrotum are sectioned and closed at a 
section which will forbid the sperm cells 
to follow to the ejaculatory duct but still 
allowing the release of seminal fluid 
during ejaculation.
Surgical sterilization of women is often 
done by bilateral tubal ligation. With 
tubal ligation the ovum does not pass to 
the uterus so the sperm cells cannot 
reach it.
37. How does the 
contraceptive diaphragm 
work? What are the 
limitations of this 
contraceptive method?
The contraceptive diaphragm is an 
artifact made of latex or plastic that 
when placed on the vaginal fundus 
covers the uterine cervix forbidding the 
passage of sperm cells through the 
cervical canal. To be more effective the 
diaphragm needs to be used together 
with spermicide. This method however 
does not prevent sexually transmitted 
diseases (STDs).
38. Why is the use of condoms 
not just a contraceptive 
method but also a health 
protection behavior?
The use of condoms besides being an 
efficient contraceptive method also 
helps the prevention of diseases caused 
by sexually transmitted agents (STDs), 
like syphilis, gonorrhea, HPV (human 
papilloma virus that may lead to genital 
cancers) infestation, HIV infection, etc.

39. What is the normal 
duration of the menstrual 
cycle? How does the calendar 
contraceptive method work?
The normal duration of the menstrual 
cycle is 28 days but it can vary among 
different women or in different cycles of 
the same woman.
In the calendar contraceptive method 
the date n-14 (n minus 14) is taken 
considering n the number of days of the 
normal menstrual cycle of the woman 
(generally n=28). The safety margin +3 
or –3 refers to the days around n-14 
that intercourse should be avoided to 
prevent pregnancy. (This method is not 
exempt from failures. A doctor must 
always be consulted before relying on 
any contraceptive method.)
40. How is the ovulation date 
estimated with the control of 
the woman's body 
temperature?
One method to estimate the exact 
ovulation day is daily control of the 
body temperature taken always under 
same conditions. At the ovulation day 
the body temperature often increases 
about 0.5 degrees centigrade.
41. What is the contraceptive 
mechanism of the IUD?
The IUD (intrauterine device) is a piece 
of plastic coated with copper that is 
inserted within the uterus by a doctor. 
Copper is then gradually released (IUD 
may last 5 to 10 years) and since it has 
a spermicidal action sperm cells are 
destroyed before fecundation. Besides 
this mechanism the movement of the 
IUD inside the uterus causes slight 
endometrial inflammation that helps to 
prevent nidation.
42. Generally how does a male 
animal realize that the female 
is receptive to copulation?
In most vertebrate species with internal 
fecundation the females have 
reproductive cycles with fertile periods. 
During this period the female secretes 
pheromones (odoriferous substances 
that attract the male of the species) 
from the skin and mucosae. The 
presence of the male individual and his 
pheromones also stimulates the release 
of pheromones by the female. (Many 
animals also use pheromones for 
territorial demarcation and for signal 
transmission between individuals about 
the location of dangers and food.)
43. What is parthenogenesis?
Parthenogenesis is the reproduction or 
formation of a new individual from the 
egg cell but without fecundation by the 
male gamete. According to the species, 
individuals born by parthenogenesis 
may be male or female, or of any sex.
In bees the drone (the single male bee) 
is haploid and born by parthenogenesis 
while the females (queen and workers) 
are diploid.

Biology Questions and Answers
Embryonic 
Development
1. What is the cell division 
process directly related to the 
embryonic growth?
The embryonic growth depends directly 
on mitosis. Through this type of cell 
division the zygote divides itself giving 
birth to a series of cells that by mitosis 
also compose differentiated tissues and 
organs until the formation of a complete 
individual.
2. What is the function of the 
vitellus in the vertebrate egg? 
How are these eggs classified 
according to the amount of 
vitellus within them?
Vitellus (yolk) is the nutritive material 
that accumulates in the cytoplasm of 
the egg (zygote) with the function of 
nourishing the embryo. According to the 
amount of vitellus in them, the 
vertebrate eggs are classified as 
oligolecithal (little yolk), centrolecithal, 
or heterolecithal (more yolk diffusely 
distributed) and telolecithal (more yolk 
concentrated in one end of the egg).
3. What are the animal pole 
and the vegetal pole of the 
vertebrate egg?
The animal pole of a telolecithal egg is 
the portion of the egg with little vitellus, 
it is opposite to the vegetal pole which 
is the region where the yolk is 
concentrated.
4. What are the four initial 
stages of the embryonic 
development?
The four initial stages of the embryonic 
development are the morula stage, the 
blastula stage, the gastrula stage and 
the neurula stage.
5. What is the cell division 
during the first stage of the 
embryonic development 
called? How is this stage 
characterized?
The cell division in the first stage of the 
embryonic developments is called 
cleavage, or segmentation. In this stage 
several mitoses occur from the zygote 
forming the new embryo.
6. What are the cells produced 
in the first stage of the 
embryonic development 
called?
The cells that result from the cleavage 
(the first stage of the embryonic 
development) are called blastomeres. In 
this stage the embryo is called morula 
(similar to a “morus”, mulberry).

Biology Questions and Answers
7. After the morula stage what 
is the next stage? What is the 
morphological feature that 
defines this stage?
After passing the morula stage in which 
the embryo is a compact mass of cells, 
the next stage is the blastula stage. In 
the blastula stage the compactness is 
lost and an internal cavity filled with 
fluid appears inside, the blastocele.
8. After the blastula stage 
what is the following stage of 
the embryonic development? 
What is the passage from 
blastula to the next stage 
called?
The blastula turns into gastrula in a 
process known as gastrulation.
9. What is gastrulation? How 
during gastrulation are the 
first two germ layers formed? 
What are these germ layers?
Gastrulation is the process through 
which a portion of the blastula wall 
undergoes invagination inside the 
blastocele, forming a tube called 
archenteron (primitive intestine). The 
cells of the inner side of the tube form 
the endoderm (germ layer) and the cells 
of the outer side form the ectoderm 
(another germ layer). It is the beginning 
of the tissue differentiation in embryonic 
development.
10. What are the archenteron 
and the blastopore? What is 
the stage of the embryonic 
development in which these 
structures are formed? What 
are the destinations of the 
archenteron and of the 
blastopore?
Archenteron is the tube formed during 
gastrulation by means of invagination of 
the blastula wall inside the blatocele. It 
is the origin of the gastrointestinal tract. 
Blastopore is the opening of the 
archenteron to the exterior. The 
blastopore gives birth to one of the 
extremities of the digestive tube: the 
mouth in protostome beings, or the 
anus in deuterostome beings.
11. How is the mesoderm 
(third germ layer) of 
triploblastic animals formed?
The mesoderm appears from 
differentiation of endodermal cells that 
cover the dorsal region of the 
archenteron.
12. What are the three types 
of germ layers that form 
tissues and organs in animals?
The three germ layers are the 
ectoderm, the mesoderm and the 
endoderm.

Biology Questions and Answers
13. How are animals classified 
according to the germ layers 
present in their embryonic 
development?
Cnidarians are diploblastic, i.e., they 
present only endoderm and ectoderm. 
With the exception of poriferans, all 
remaining animals are triploblastic. 
Poriferans do not present differentiated 
tissue organization and so they do not 
classify regarding germ layers (although 
sometimes they are mentioned as 
diploblastic).
14. How does the embryo turn 
from gastrula into neurula? 
How is the neural tube 
formed? What is the 
embryonic origin of the 
nervous system in 
vertebrates?
The neurula stage is characterized by 
the appearance of the neural tube along 
the dorsal region of the embryo. The 
growth of mesoderm in that region 
induces the differentiation of ectodermal 
cells just above. These cells then 
differentiate forming the neural tube. So 
the origin of the nervous system is the 
ectoderm (the same germ layer that 
gives birth to the skin).
15. What is the notochord? 
How is this structure formed?
The notochord is a rodlike structure that 
forms the supporting axis of the embryo 
and gives birth to the vertebral column 
in vertebrates. It is formed by 
differentiation of mesodermal cells.
16. What is the coelom? To 
which structures do coeloms 
give birth? Are all animals 
coelomate?
Coeloms are cavities delimited by 
mesoderm. Coeloms originate the 
cavities where the internal organs of the 
body are located, like the pericardial 
cavity, the peritoneal cavity and the 
pleural cavity.
Besides coelomate animals, there are 
acoelomate animals, like 
platyhelminthes, and pseudocoelomate 
animals, like nematodes.
17. What is the germ layer 
from which the coeloms 
originate?
The coeloms are originated from 
mesoderm.
18. What are pleura, 
pericardium and peritoneum?
Pleura is the membrane that covers the 
lungs and the inner wall of the chest; 
pericardium is the membrane that 
covers the heart; peritoneum is the 
membrane that covers most organs of 
the gastrointestinal tract and part of the 
abdominal cavity. All these membranes 
delimit coeloms (internal cavities).

Biology Questions and Answers
19. After the neurula stage 
and from its ventral portion to 
the dorsal how can the 
morphology of the embryo be 
described?
In a schematic longitudinal section of 
the embryo after the neurula stage, the 
outermost layer of cells is the ectoderm. 
In the ventral region comes the 
archenteron tube formed of endodermal 
cells. In both sides of the embryo 
coeloms delimited by mesoderm are 
present. In the central region above the 
archenteron and in the middle of the 
coeloms there is the notochord. In the 
dorsal region just above the notochord 
lies the neural tube.
20. What are somites?
Somites are differentiated portions of 
mesodermal tissue longitudinally 
distributed along the embryo. The 
somites originate the muscle tissue and 
portions of the connective tissues.
21. What are histogenesis and 
organogenesis?
Histogenesis is the process of tissue 
formation in the embryonic 
development. Organogenesis is the 
process of organ formation. Before 
histogenesis and organogenesis the 
primitive embryonic structures have 
been already formed: germ layers, 
neural tube, notochord, coeloms, 
somites.
22. From which germ layer do 
the epidermis and the nervous 
system originate? What are 
other organs and tissues made 
from that germ layer?
Epidermis and nervous system have the 
same embryonic origin: the ectoderm. 
The epidermal appendages (like nails, 
hair, sweat glands and sebaceous 
glands), the mammary glands, the 
adenohypophysis, the cornea, the 
crystalline lens and the retina are also 
derived from ectoderm.
23. From which germ layer do 
blood cells originate? What 
are other organs and tissues 
made from that germ layer?
Blood cells have a mesodermal 
embryonic origin. Other organs made 
from mesoderm are: covering serous 
membranes like the pericardium, the 
peritoneum and the pleura, muscles, 
cartilages, dermis, adipose tissue, 
kidneys, ureters, bladder, urethra, 
gonads, blood and lymph vessels, 
bones.
24. From which germ layer do 
the liver and the pancreas 
originate? What are other 
organs and tissues made from 
that germ layer?
The liver and the pancreas are 
originated from the endoderm. Also 
from endodermal origin are the epithelia 
of the airway, the epithelia of the

bladder, of the urethra and of the GI 
tube (except of the mouth and anus), 
the alveolar cells of the lungs and the 
thyroid and parathyroid glands.
25. What are twins? 
Genetically what are the two 
types of twins that can be 
generated?
Twins are simultaneously generated 
(within the mother’s uterus) offspring. 
Twins classify according to zygosity as 
monozygotic or as dizygotic twins.
Monozygotic twins, also known as 
identical twins, are those originated 
from one single fertilized ovum 
(therefore from one single zygote); 
monozygotic twins are genetically 
identical, i.e., they have identical 
genotypes and are necessarily of the 
same sex. Dizygotic twins, also known 
as fraternal twins, are those generated 
from two different ova fecundated by 
two different sperm cells; so they are 
not genetically identical and they are 
not necessarily of the same sex.
26. What is polyembryony?
Polyembryony is the phenomenon in 
which a single embryo in its initial 
embryonic stage divides itself forming 
many new individuals of the same sex 
and genetically identical. This is the 
way, for example, in which reproduction 
takes place in armadillos of the genus 
Dasypus. Polyembryony is an example 
of natural “cloning”.

Biology Questions and Answers
Extraembryonic 
Membranes
1. What are extraembryonic 
membranes?
Extraembryonic membranes are 
membranous structures that appear in 
parallel with the embryo and play 
important roles in the embryonic 
development. They form from the 
embryo but do not become part of the 
individual organism after its birth.
2. What are the 
extraembryonic membranes 
present in vertebrates?
The extraembryonic membranes that 
may be present in vertebrates are the 
yolk sac, the amnion, the chorion, the 
allantois and the placenta.
3. Are the extraembryonic 
membranes the same in all 
vertebrates?
The presence of each extraembryonic 
membrane varies according to the 
vertebrate class.
In fishes and amphibians only the yolk 
sac is present. In reptiles and birds 
besides the yolk sac there are also the 
amnion, the chorion and the allantois. 
In placental mammals besides all these 
membranes the placenta is present too.
4. How is the yolk sac formed? 
What is the function of the 
yolk sac?
The yolk sac is formed from the 
covering of the vitellus by some cells 
originated from the primitive gut.
The yolk sac stores vitellus, the main 
nourishment source of non-placental 
embryos.
5. Which is the 
extraembryonic membrane 
whose function is to store 
nitrogen wastes of the 
embryo? Is this function 
present in placental 
mammalian embryos?
The allantois is the extraembryonic 
membrane whose function is to store 
the excreted matter of the embryo.
In placental mammals the allantois is 
present but it does not exert that 
function since the embryonic wastes are 
collected by the mother’s body through 
the placenta.

Transaction ID: 4KS71350WY6468607

Biology Questions and Answers
6. Why can the allantois be 
considered an adaptation to 
terrestrial life?
The allantois is an adaptation to dry 
land because in embryos of oviparous 
terrestrial beings, like reptiles and birds, 
the metabolic residuals cannot be 
immediately excreted to the aquatic 
surrounds (as fishes and amphibian 
larvae do). It was necessary then for 
the appearance of a structure capable of 
storing the embryonic excretes until 
hatching.
7. What is the difference 
between amnion and chorion?
Amnion is the membrane that covers 
the embryo. Chorion is the membrane 
that covers the amnion, the yolk sac 
and the allantois. The space delimited 
by the chorion and the amnion is called 
amniotic cavity and it is filled with 
aminiotic fluid. The amniotic cavity has 
the functions of preventing desiccation 
of the embryo and of protecting it 
against mechanical shocks.
8. Why can the amnion also be 
considered an adaptation to 
terrestrial life?
The amnion is also an adaptation to dry 
land since one of its functions is to 
prevent desiccation of the embryo.
9. What is the chorioallantois 
membrane present in the 
embryonic development of 
reptiles and birds? How does 
this membrane participate in 
the energetic metabolism of 
the embryo?
The chorioallantois membrane is formed 
by juxtaposition of some regions of the 
chorion and the allantois. Since it is 
porous, the chorioallantois membrane 
allows the passage of gases between 
the embryo and the exterior thus 
making aerobic cellular respiration 
possible.
10. In which type of animals 
does the placenta exist? What 
is its main function?
True placenta is present in placental 
mammals.
The placenta is formed from the chorion 
of the embryo and from the mother’s 
endometrium. Its main function is to 
allow the exchange of substances 
between the fetus and the mother’s 
body.
11. What are the main 
substances transferred from 
the mother to the fetus 
through the placenta? And 
from the fetus to the mother?
From the mother to the fetus the main 
transferred substances through the 
placenta are water, oxygen, nutrients

and antibodies. From the fetus to the 
mother, metabolic wastes, including 
urea (nitrogen waste), and carbon 
dioxide.
12. Is there a exchange of 
cells between the mother and 
the fetus through the 
placenta?
Under normal conditions, there is no 
passage of cells across the placenta 
during gestation. The placenta has a 
smooth mucosa separating the richly 
vascularized region in contact with the 
mother’s endometrium from the 
umbilical cord in contact with the fetal 
blood. This barrier is known as placental 
barrier. Although permeable to some 
substances (selective permeability) the 
placental barrier forbids the passage of 
cells.
13. What are the endocrine 
functions of the placenta?
The placenta has endocrine function 
since it secretes the hormones 
progesterone and estrogen that 
maintain the endometrium (internal 
covering of the uterus) and prevent 
menses during pregnancy. The placenta 
also secretes other important hormones 
for pregnancy regulation.
14. What is the function of the 
umbilical cord?
The umbilical cord is a set of blood 
vessels that connects the fetus with the 
placenta. In the fetus one extremity of 
the cord inserts into the center of the 
abdominal wall (the later scar of this 
insertion is the umbilicus or navel).
The function of the umbilical cord is to 
allow the transport of substances, 
nutrients, gases and residuals, between 
the fetus and the mother’s body.

Biology Questions and Answers
Plant Classification
1. What are the main cellular 
features of the beings of the 
plant kingdom?
The typical plant cells are eukaryotic 
(have nucleus), autotrophic (produce 
their own food) and photosynthetic (use 
light to make food). Plant cells also 
have chloroplasts and a cell wall (a 
structure exterior to the plasma 
membrane) made of cellulose.
2. How different are animal 
cells from plant cells?
While plant cells are eukaryotic, 
autotrophic, photosynthetic and have 
chloroplasts and cell wall, the animal 
cells are eukaryotic, heterotroph and do 
not present chloroplasts nor cell wall.
3. Do plants have tissue 
organization and specialized 
organs?
Plants have specialized organs (like 
reproductive organs, roots, limbs, 
leaves) and differentiated tissues 
(vascular tissue in tracheophytes, 
support tissue, parenchyma, etc.)
4. What are the subkingdoms 
into which the plant kingdom 
is divided?
The kingdom Plantae is divided into two 
big subkingdoms: the bryophytes and 
the tracheophytes (pteridophytes, 
gymnosperms and angiosperms). The 
criterion for the division is the presence 
or not of conductive (vascular) tissue.
5. What is the difference 
between bryophytes and 
tracheophytes?
Bryophytes are nonvascular plants 
(mosses, liverworts, hornworts), i.e., 
they do not have a conductive system 
for transport of sugar, water and 
nutrients. Tracheophyte plants are 
vascular plants, they have conductive 
structures.
6. What are the four main 
groups into which the study of 
the plants is divided?
In Botany the plant kingdom is divided 
into bryophytes, pteridophytes, 
gymnosperms and angiosperms.
7. What is the difference 
between cryptogamic and 
phanerogamic plants?
Cryptogamic (hidden sex organs) plants 
are those that do not present flowers or

seeds. They comprise the bryophytes 
and the pteridophytes.
Phanerogamic plants are those having 
seeds. They comprise the gymnosperms 
and the angiosperms.
8. What are the two divisions 
of the angiosperms?
The angiosperms are divided into 
monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous. 
(These categories are explained later in 
this text.)
9. What are the three basic 
sexual life cycles studied in 
Biology? Which of them 
corresponds to metagenesis? 
Which of them is the human 
life cycle?
Sexual reproduction may take place 
through three different types of life 
cycles: the haplontic (the being is 
haploid) haplobiontic (a single type of 
being) cycle; the diplontic (the being is 
haploid) haplobiontic (a single type of 
being) cycle; and the diplobiontic cycle 
(two types of beings, one haploid and 
the other diploid). The diblobiontic cycle 
is known as alternation of generations, 
or metagenesis. In humans the cycle is 
diplontic haplobiotic (a single diploid 
being).
10. What respectively are 
zygotic meiosis, gametic 
meiosis and sporic meiosis?
Zygotic meiosis is the one that occurs in 
the haplontic haplobiontic life cycle. 
Gametes from adult haploid individuals 
unite forming the diploid zygote. The 
zygote undergoes meiosis and 
generates four haploid cells that by 
mitosis develop into adult individuals. 
Therefore in the zygotic meiosis the cell 
that undergoes meiosis is the zygote 
and the gametes are formed by mitosis.
Gametic meiosis is that in which meiosis 
produces gametes, i.e., haploid cells 
that each of which can unite with 
another gamete forming the zygote. It 
occurs in the diplontic haplobiontic life 
cycle (e.g., in humans) in which the 
individual is diploid and meiosis forms 
gametes.
Sporic meiosis happens in metagenesis 
(alternation of generations, or 
diplobiontic life cycle). In this life cycle 
cells from the diploid individual (called 
sporophyte) undergo meiosis producing 
haploid spores that do not unite with 
others but instead develop by mitosis 
into haploid individuals (called 
gametophytes). In this life cycle the 
gametes are made by mitosis from cells 
of the gametophyte.
11. Are gametes always made 
by meiosis?
In the plant life cycle (diplobiontic life 
cycle) and in the haplontic haplobiontic 
life cycle gametes are made by mitosis 
and not by meiosis. Obviously in some

stage of these sexual life cycles meiosis 
must occur.
12. Why is the plant life cycle 
known as alternation of 
generations?
The plant life cycle is known as 
alternation of generations because in 
this cycle there are two different forms 
of living beings that alternate each 
other, one haploid and the other diploid. 
Alternation of generations is also called 
the diplobiontic cycle, or metagenesis, 
and it does not occur only in plants, 
other living beings, like cnidarians, 
present the cycle.
13. For each of the three types 
of life cycles what is the 
respective ploidy of the 
individual that represents the 
adult or lasting form?
In the haplontic haplobiontic life cycle 
the single and lasting form is haploid. In 
the diplontic haplobiontic life cycle it is 
diploid. In the diplobiontic life cycle the 
lasting individual that alternates with 
the intermediate form may be the 
haploid gametophyte (as in bryophytes) 
or the diploid sporophyte (as in 
pteridophytes).
14. Do plants present only 
sexual reproduction?
There are asexual forms of reproduction 
in plants. Some naturally detached 
pieces of root, limbs or leaves develop 
into another complete individual. 
Artificial asexual reproduction of plants 
can be obtained by means of grafting or 
cutting.

Biology Questions and Answers
Bryophytes
1. What are the main 
characteristics of the 
bryophytes?
Bryophytes are nonvascular plants, i.e., 
they do not have conductive tissues and 
they perform transport of water and 
nutrients by diffusion; they are 
cryptogamic, i.e., they do not present 
flowers or seeds; they are small in size; 
they present water-dependant 
fecundation; in their life cycle the 
lasting form is haploid (the 
gametophyte) and the sporophyte 
depends on the gametophyte to survive.
2. What are the main 
bryophyte groups?
The main bryophyte groups are the 
mosses, the liverworts and the 
hornworts.
3. How is the transport of 
substances done across the 
bryophyte tissues? How is this 
feature related to the general 
size of these plants?
In bryophytes there are no water-
conducting or nutrient-conducting 
structures and the transport of these 
substances is done by cell to cell 
diffusion. The small size of bryophytes 
relates to this feature since if there are 
no conductive vessels it is not viable to 
have cells too far from each other (the 
emergence of the conductive tissues in 
tracheophytes allowed their increase in 
size).
4. What is the life cycle type 
of bryophytes?
As in all plants the life cycle of 
bryophytes is diplobiontic (alternation of 
generations). In bryophytes the lasting 
form is the haploid one.
5. In general where is the 
sporophyte positioned in 
relation to the gametophyte in 
bryophytes? How does the 
sporophyte obtain nutrients?
The bryophyte sporophyte in general is 
a tiny long stem that grows on the top 
of the gametophyte. The sporophyte 
depends totally upon the gametophyte 
to obtain nutrients.
6. Why can the bryophytes be 
considered the “amphibians of 
the plant world”?
Like adult amphibians, the bryophytes 
live in the terrestrial environment but 
they depend on water to reproduce. For 
this reason the nickname is justified.

Biology Questions and Answers
Pteridophytes
1. What are the main 
representatives of the 
pteridophytes? Is this plant 
group cryptogamic or 
phanerogamic?
The better known pteridophytes are the 
ferns and the maidenhairs, from the 
filicinae (filicopsida) group, and the 
selaginellas, mosslike plants from the 
lycopodineae group (lycopsida). 
Pteridophytes are cryptogamic plants, 
i.e., they are flowerless and seedless.
2. How different are 
pteridophytes from 
bryophytes regarding 
substance transport?
Pteridophytes are tracheophyte 
(vascular) plants, i.e., they have tissues 
specialized in conduction of water and 
nutrients. Bryophytes are nonvascular 
plants. In pteridophytes therefore the 
substance transport is done through 
vessels and in bryophytes that transport 
occurs by diffusion.
3. Why are pteridophytes 
better adapted to dry land 
than bryophytes? Were 
pteridophytes always less 
abundant than phanerogamic 
plants?
Although bryophytes and pteridophytes 
have water-dependant gametes for 
fecundation the emergence of 
conductive vessels in this last group 
facilitated life in a terrestrial 
environment. The conductive vessels of 
the pteridophytes collect water from the 
moist soil and distribute it to the cells. 
Bryophytes do not have this option and 
they depend entirely on the water that 
reaches the aerial part of the plant and 
so they need to live in humid or rainy 
places.
Before the ascension of the 
phanerogamic plants (plants that 
present seeds) the pteridophytes were 
the plants that predominated in the 
terrestrial environment. The large 
pteridophyte forests of the 
Carboniferous period (named after the 
pteridophytes) are responsible for the 
formation of coal deposits, mainly in 
Europe, Asia and North America; the 
Carboniferous period occurred between 
290 and 360 million years ago and is 
part of the Paleozoic era.
4. What is the evolutionary 
importance of pteridophytes?
As the first tracheophytes, 
pteridophytes were also the first plants 
to extensively colonize the terrestrial 
environment forming forests. They also

constituted an important source of food 
for terrestrial animals. By presenting 
conductive vessels they could be larger, 
a feature inherited from them by 
phanerogamic plants.
5. What are the main parts of 
ferns?
Ferns are constituted by small roots that 
come downwards from the rhizome 
(stem, often horizontalized). The fronds 
also arise from the rhizome. On the 
back side of each leaf of the plant there 
are small dustlike dots called sori 
(singular, “sorus”, also known as 
“seeds”).
6. What is the type of life 
cycle present in 
pteridophytes?
Like all plants pteridophytes present 
diplobiontic (alternation of generations, 
or metagenesis) life cycle.
7. Why are pteridophytes 
more common in humid 
places?
Pteridophytes are more common in 
humid places because they depend on 
water for their gametes to fecundate 
one another. In humid environments 
their reproduction is more intense and 
they proliferate.
8. What is the structure of the 
adult fern within which cells 
undergoing meiosis can be 
found?
In these plants meiosis takes place 
within structures called sorus (plural, 
sori), small dustlike brown dots lining 
the underside of fern leaves. The sori 
contain sporangia where reproductive 
cells undergo meiosis and where spores 
are produced.
9. What is the prothallus of 
pteridophytes?
Prothallus is the pteridophyte 
gametophyte (the haploid individual 
that forms gametes). The gametophyte 
develops by mitosis from a spore.
10. How are gametes formed 
in the pteridophyte life cycle, 
by mitosis or meiosis? What is 
the type of meiosis that occurs 
in pteridophytes?
In pteridophytes gametes are made by 
mitosis from special cells of the 
gametophyte. As in all plants, in 
pteridophytes, meiosis is sporic, i.e., 
cells of the sporophyte undergo meiosis 
and generate spores that then by 
mitosis develop into the gametophyte.

11. What is the lasting form in 
pteridophytes, the 
gametophyte or the 
sporophyte? How can it be 
compared to bryophytes?
The lasting form in pteridophytes is the 
diploid (2n) sporophyte (the fern itself, 
for example). In bryophytes the lasting 
form is the gametophyte (n).
12. What is xaxim?
Most pteridophytes have subterraneous 
stems parallel to the substrate called 
rhizomes. Xaxim is a type of 
pteridophyte with an aerial stem 
generally perpendicular to the soil and 
from which hundreds of roots arise to 
absorb water from the environment. 
The xaxim stem is used to make flower 
pots and other plant supports for 
gardening (also popularly known as 
xaxim).

This group of plants can be divided into 
conifers (pine, sequoia, cypress), that 
have flowers known as strobiles 
(cones), cycads (very ancient 
gymnosperms, like the cycads used in 
garden architecture, that also form 
strobiles), gnetaceae (gnetum) and 
ginkgos (the known species is Ginkgo 
biloba).
2. How different are 
gymnosperms from 
bryophytes and 
pteridophytes?
Gymnosperms are not cryptogamic as 
bryophytes and pteridophytes are. They 
are phanerogamic and so they form 
flowers and seeds.
3. What is the evolutionary 
importance of the emergence 
of seeds in the plant kingdom?
The evolutionary importance of the seed 
is related to the plant capability of 
distant colonization and to the 
protection of the embryo. Embryo-
containing seeds can be carried by 
water, wind and animals and germinate 
in different environments. This fact 
contributes to the exploration of a 
variety of ecological niches and for the 
diversity of plant species.
Seeds in addition protect the plant 
embryo against external aggressions 
and they also provide germination under 
more adequate conditions (inside the 
seed). These features contribute to the 
evolutionary success of the 
phanerogam.
4. In which areas of the globe 
is gymnosperm abundance 
noteworthy?
These plants are the typical vegetation 
of cold regions like the taiga, or boreal 
forest, of the northern hemisphere, or 
the araucaria forests of the southern 
hemisphere.
5. What is the life cycle of the 
gymnosperms?
As all plants they present a diplobiontic 
life cycle, i.e., alternation of generations 
with diploid and haploid stages. The 
lasting (final) stage is the diploid one.
6. What is pollen?
Pollen grains are the male 
gametophytes of the phanerogamic 
(flowering) plants. Therefore within the 
pollen grains the male gametes of these 
plants are formed by mitosis.

7. How are the male gametes 
of gymnosperms formed? 
What is the relationship 
between the pollen grains and 
the concept of alternation of 
generations?
In the male strobiles (cones) there are 
microsporophylls (fertile leaves of the 
strobile) that contain microsporangia. 
Within the microsporagium spore 
mother cells undergo meiosis and 
generate haploid microspores. The 
microspore wall develops into winglike 
projections (to facilitate its aerial 
propagation) and mitosis occurs 
producing two cells, the generative cell 
and the tube cell. The final structure 
containing these elements is the pollen 
grain.
The pollen grain relates to the 
alternation of generations since it is the 
male gametophyte (the haploid stage of 
the life cycle).
8. How are the female 
gametes of gymnosperms 
formed? What is the 
relationship between this 
process and the concept of 
alternation of generations?
In the female strobiles (cones) there are 
megasporophylls (fertile leaves of the 
strobile) that contain megasporangia. In 
the megasporangium the spore mother 
cell undergoes meiosis generating four 
haploid cells of which three regress and 
one gives birth to the functional 
megaspore. The functional megaspore 
by several mitosis forms the female 
gametophyte that contains the 
oospheres (female gametes) of the 
plant. The female gametophyte is 
located within the megasporangium that 
has a small opening, the micropyle, 
through which the pollen tube enters.
The process is related to the diplobiontic 
life cycle (alternation of generations) 
since the functional megaspore 
generates the haploid stage of the plant 
(the female gametophyte).
9. How do fecundation and 
zygote formation occur in 
these plants? Do these 
processes depend on water?
The microsporangia in the male strobile 
rupture at the right period of the year 
releasing thousands of pollen grains. 
Since their pollen grains are “winged” 
they can be transported by the wind 
over distances. When the pollen grains 
fall into the female strobiles they pass 
the micropyle and enter the pollen 
chamber. This process is called 
pollination.
Within the pollen chamber the 
generative cell nucleus divides forming 
two gametic nuclei and the tube cell 
elongates forming the pollen tube. The 
pollen tube penetrates the female 
gametophyte and the gametic nuclei 
(also known as sperm nuclei) pass 
through the tube; one of them unites 
with an oosphere (the female gamete) 
and forms the zygote (2n). Generally 
fecundation occurs one year after 
pollination and during this time interval 
the maturation of the male and of the 
female gametes takes place.

The fecundation in these plants is 
independent from water. The 
gametophytes however are entirely 
dependent on the sporophyte (the adult 
plant) for nutrition and hydration.
10. How are the gymnosperm 
seeds formed? What are the 
ploidies of the structures that 
compose the seeds?
Their seeds are formed from 
differentiation of the megasporangia in 
the female strobiles (cones). After an 
oosphere is fecundated the female 
gametophyte originates the haploid (n) 
primary endosperm (nutritive tissue 
that covers the embryo) and the 
covering of the megasporangium turns 
into the diploid (2n) seed shell.

Biology Questions and Answers
Angiosperms
1. What are angiosperms, the 
flowering plants? What is the 
main feature that 
distinguishes them from the 
gymnosperms?
Flowering plants have flowers and seeds 
(phanerogamic plants). They differ from 
gymnosperms by having their seeds 
within fruits.
2. What are the two main 
groups into which flowering 
plants are divided?
Angiosperm plants are divided into 
monocotyledonous (monocots) and 
dicotyledonous (dicots).
3. What are the main 
morphological differences 
between monocot plants and 
dicot plants?
The main differentiation criteria between 
monocots and dicots are: number of 
cotyledons (seed leaf) in seeds, one in 
monocots and two in dicots; pattern of 
leaf veins, parallel in monocots, 
reticulated in dicots; multiplicity of petal 
number, multiples of three in monocots, 
multiples of four or five in dicots; 
position of vascular bundles in the stem, 
scattered in monocots, concentrically 
ringed in dicots.
Grasses, banana tree, sugar cane, 
orchids are examples of monocots. 
Sunflowers, oaks and waterlilies are 
examples of dicots.
4. What are the androecium 
and the gynoecium? What are 
the other structures of 
flowers?
Androecium is the set of male 
reproductive structures of flowers. It 
comprehends the stamens formed of 
filament and anther; one flower has one 
androecium that may have one or 
several stamens. Gynoecium is the set 
of female reproductive structures of 
flowers. It generally is composed of a 
single pistil that includes the stigma, the 
style and the ovary. The androecium 
usually surrounds the central 
gynoecium.
Besides the androecium and the 
gynoecium typical flowers are also made 
of peduncle, sepals and petals.
5. What is pollination? What 
are the main forms of 
pollination?
The process in which pollen grains (the 
male gametophytes of phanerogamic 
plants) reach the female gametophyte is 
called pollination.
The main forms of pollination are: 
anemophily, in which pollen is carried 
by wind. Hydrophily, pollination helped

by water; entomophily, pollen carried by 
insects; ornitophily, pollination by birds; 
chiropterophily, pollen dissemination by 
bats.
Characteristics of the flowers of each 
plant species relate to the type of 
pollination used by the plant. Colored 
flowers are specialized in bird and insect 
attraction; nocturnal flowers generally 
are white and perfumed, many 
specialized in pollination by bats; the 
nectar is also a specialization to attract 
pollinator animals; flowers that produce 
an exaggerated amount of pollen often 
use the wind as pollinator; the position 
of anthers more external or internal 
next to the nectar is a way to facilitate 
the pollen dissemination respectively by 
the wind or by animals.
6. How are the male 
gametophytes and the male 
gametes formed in 
angiosperms?
In the anthers of each stamen there are 
pollen sacs. Within the pollen sacs there 
are microspore mother cells, or 
microsporocytes. These cells undergo 
meiosis forming microspores. Each 
microspore by mitosis forms a pollen 
grain containing one generative cell and 
one tube cell. The pollen grain is the 
male gametophyte.
When pollination occurs and the pollen 
grain makes contact with the stigma 
(the apex of the pistil) the tube cell 
elongates its cytoplasm forming the 
pollen tube that grows towards the 
ovary. The generative cell divides 
forming two sperm nuclei (male 
gametes) that migrate through the 
pollen tube.
7. How many cellular nuclei 
does the pollen tube of 
angiosperms have? What is 
the ploidy of each of these 
nuclei?
The pollen tube that is the mature male 
gametophyte of angiosperms has three 
cellular nuclei: two sperm nuclei and 
one tube cell nucleus.
All those nuclei are part of the male 
gametophyte of the plant and thus each 
of them is haploid (n).
8. How is the female 
gametophyte formed in 
angiosperms?
In the flower ovary there are 
megasporangia enclosed by a tegument 
having a small opening, the micropyle. 
Within the megasporangium there is a 
megasporocyte, or megaspore mother 
cell, that undergoes meiosis forming 
four megaspores of which three regress 
and only one is functional. The 
functional megaspore undergoes (three) 
mitosis generating eight cells that as a 
whole form the embryonic sac.

Biology Questions and Answers
9. What is the embryonic sac? 
Which are the cells that form 
the embryonic sac? What are 
their ploidies?
The embryonic sac is the female 
gametophyte of angiosperms.
The embryonic sac is composed of three 
cells that remain next to the micropyle, 
two lateral synergids and the central 
oosphere (egg); one binucleated cell, 
the polar nuclei, is placed in the central 
region; three antipodal cells stay in the 
opposite side to the micropyle.
Since all these cells come by mitosis 
from the functional megaspore they are 
haploid (n).
10. After pollination how does 
fecundation occur in 
angiosperms? In these plants 
is fecundation dependent on 
water?
After pollination one of the sperm nuclei 
from the pollen tube unites with the 
oosphere of the embryonic sac forming 
the diploid (2n) zygote. The other 
sperm nucleus fuses with the polar 
nuclei of the embryonic sac originating a 
triploid (3n) cell that by mitosis will turn 
into the secondary endosperm of the 
seed. The synergids and the antipodal 
cells degenerate after the fecundation 
process.
Fecundation in these plants is 
independent from water.
11. What is the difference 
between self pollination and 
cross pollination? Which of 
these two modes of 
pollination contributes more 
to the plant diversity?
Self pollination occurs when pollen 
grains from a flowering plant fall into 
the pistils of the same plant and thus 
gametes from the same individual unite 
to form a zygote. Cross pollination 
occurs when pollinators carry pollen 
grains from a plant to reach other 
individual plants of the same species 
thus gametes of different individuals 
form the zygote.
Since it promotes formation of zygotes 
containing genes from different 
individuals (new gene combinations) 
cross pollination contributes more to 
biological diversity.
12. What is dichogamy?
Dichogamy is the phenomenon of the 
maturation of female reproductive 
structures of the plant in a different 
period to the maturation of the male 
reproductive structures. Dichogamy 
prevents self pollination and makes 
cross pollination almost obligatory so 
assisting in an evolutionary strategy to 
promote genetic recombination.

structures of the seed? What 
is endosperm?

Biology Questions and Answers
A typical seed is composed of the 
embryo, endosperm and shell. Within 
seeds of angiosperms there are one or 
two cotyledons (seed leaf, one in 
monocots, two in dicots).
The endosperm is the tissue within the 
seed that has the function of nourishing 
the embryo.
14. How different are the 
endosperm of gymnosperms 
and the endosperm of 
angiosperms?
In gymnosperms the endosperm is 
haploid (n), it is called primary 
endosperm. In angiosperm the 
endosperm is triploid (3n), it is called 
secondary endosperm.
15. What are cotyledons?
Cotyledons, or seed leaves, are 
structures formed by the embryo of 
angiosperms to absorb nutrients from 
the endosperm and to store and 
transfer these nutrients to the embryo. 
(Cotyledons are auxiliary embryonic 
structures).
Seeds of monocots have a single 
cotyledon. Seeds of dicots have two 
cotyledons.
16. What are the main 
functions of fruits?
The main functions of fruits are the 
protection and spreading of seeds.
17. From which floral 
structure do fruits come?
Fruits are modified ovaries of the 
flowers.
18. How are fruits formed?
The fecundation in angiosperms triggers 
the release of hormones that act upon 
the ovaries. The ovary wall then 
develops into a fruit that contains the 
seeds.
19. Are fruits always the flesh 
part of the “fruits”? Is the 
edible part of the onion a 
fruit?
In some so-called fruits the actual fruit 
is not the flesh part. For example, the 
flesh part of the strawberry is not the 
fruit. The fruits are the small hard dots 
on the surface of the strawberry. 
Another example: the flesh part of the 
cashew is not the fruit. The fruit is the 
nut.
The edible part of the onion is the stem 
of the plant and not the fruit.
20. Why are there plants 
having single-seeded fruits 
and plants having fruits with 
more than one seed?
Plants that produce single-seeded fruits, 
for example, mango and avocado, often

have ovaries with only one egg inside. 
Fruits with more than one seed are 
originated from plants whose ovaries 
have more than one egg.
21. What are infructescences, 
pseudofruits and 
parthenocarpic fruits?
Infructescences are aggregated fruits 
formed from inflorescences, aggregated 
flowers. Grape clusters are examples of 
infructescences. Pseudofruits are “fruits” 
not made in the ovaries and in general 
their true fruits lack development and 
are found within the flesh, like in apples 
and pears. Parthenocarpic fruits are 
those made without fecundation, by 
means of hormonal stimuli, like 
bananas.
22. What is the evolutionary 
importance of the fruits for 
the angiosperms?
The fruits contain seeds and they can 
detach from the plant falling on the 
ground or can serve as food for animals. 
Therefore with the emergence of fruits 
the seeds of angiosperms could be 
transported across long distances 
contributing to the propagation of the 
species.
23. What are the trends of the 
gametophyte in the evolution 
of plants?
A tendency of the gametophyte 
evolution in plants has been towards the 
formation of gametes that are 
independent from water. In bryophytes 
and in pteridophytes the fecundation is 
totally dependent on water. In 
phanerogamic plants such dependency 
does not exist.
Another tendency is the reduction in the 
size and duration of the gametophyte. 
In bryophytes the gametophyte is 
indeed the lasting stage. In 
pteridophytes, gymnosperms and 
angiosperms it became the temporary 
stage and its relative size was 
successively reduced.
A third evolutionary trend relates to the 
interdependency between gametophytes 
and sporophytes. In bryophytes the 
sporophyte is entirely dependent on the 
gametophyte to survive. In the 
remaining plants the sporophyte is the 
independent stage and the once 
autotrophic gametophyte in bryophytes 
and pteridophytes became dependent 
upon the sporophyte in the 
phanerogamic plants.

Biology Questions and Answers
Plant Tissues
1. How are the plant tissues 
classified according to their 
functions?
Plant tissues are divided into growth 
(embryonic) tissues, supporting, filling 
and photosynthetic tissues (ground 
tissues), conductive (vascular) tissues 
and covering (dermal) tissues.
Embryonic tissues: primary meristems; 
secondary meristems. Supporting 
tissues: collenchyma; sclerenchyma. 
Filling and photosynthetic tissues: 
photosynthetic parenchyma; storage 
parenchyma. Conductive tissues: 
xylem; phloem. Covering tissues: 
epidermis; periderm.
2. Which are the growth 
tissues of plants? How do they 
classify and where can they be 
found?
The growth tissues of the plants are the 
meristems. Meristems are the tissues 
that produce the plant growth giving 
birth to all other tissues; they are 
formed of undifferentiated cells having 
intense cell division rate. Meristems 
classify as primary meristems and as 
secondary meristems.
Primary meristems are found in the 
apex of the stem, in the lateral buds of 
the stem, in the basis and tips of the 
shoots and within the root cap. Primary 
meristems are responsible for the 
primary growth (lengthening) of the 
plant.
Secondary meristems are those that 
make the plant grow in thickness 
(secondary growth) and they are 
formed by tissues that thicken the 
stem: cambium and phellogen (cork 
cambium).
3. What is the difference 
between the lateral and the 
apical buds of the plants?
Lateral buds are portions of 
meristematic tissue located in the base 
of the shoots. Apical buds are portions 
of meristematic tissue situated in the tip 
of the stem and shoots.
4. What are apical meristems? 
Which type of plant growth 
does this meristem promote?
Apical meristems are those primary 
meristems found in the apex of the 
stem and in the tips of shoots and roots.
The apical meristems are responsible for 
the primary growth of the plants.
5. What are lateral 
meristems? Where can they 
be found and which type of 
plant growth do they 
promote?

Biology Questions and Answers
Lateral, or secondary, meristems, are 
the cambium and the phellogen (also 
known as cork cambium), tissues from 
the stem, branches and roots that by 
mitosis generate other tissues. These 
tissues participate in the secondary 
growth of plant, i.e., in the thickening of 
the stem, branches and roots.
6. What are the main features 
of the meristematic cells? Why 
do these cells need to have a 
high mitotic rate?
Meristematic cells have very thin cell 
walls, small vacuoles, a well-centralized 
nucleus and they are constantly 
undergoing mitosis. Meristematic cells 
need a high mitotic rate because they 
are responsible for the plant growth.
7. What is the best 
identification hypothesis for a 
plant tissue seen under the 
microscope having most cells 
undergoing cell division?
The best hypothesis is that the tissue is 
a sample of meristematic tissue. 
Meristematic tissues seen under the 
microscope have many cells undergoing 
mitosis.
8. Which are the plant tissues 
responsible for the supporting 
of the plant?
The plant supporting tissues are the 
collenchyma and the sclerenchyma.
The collenchyma is made of living and 
elongated cells that accumulate 
cellulose and pectin in some regions of 
the cell wall making them unequally 
thick and thus providing flexibility.
The sclerenchyma is made mostly of 
dead cells killed by lignin deposition 
(lignin is an impermeable biopolymer) 
forming elongated, rigid and 
impermeable fibers. The sclerenchyma 
is a plant tissue widely used in the 
textile industry.
9. Which is the plant tissue 
responsible for the filling of 
the space between other 
tissues?
The plant-filling tissue is generically 
called parenchyma. The plant 
parenchyma can be divided into 
photosynthetic parenchyma, a tissue 
that has cells with many chloroplasts 
and a high photosynthesis rate found 
mainly in leaves, and storage 
parenchyma, specialized in the storage 
of water (e.g., in cactus), starch or air 
(e.g., in aquatic plants).
10. Where in the leaves is the 
photosynthetic tissue often 
located?
The main photosynthetic tissue is the 
photosynthetic parenchyma (also known 
as chlorenchyma, do not confuse with 
collenchyma) often located between the

superior and the inferior epidermis of 
the leaves.
11. How are water, mineral 
salts and food (sugar) 
transported throughout the 
plant?
Water, mineral salts and sugar are 
transported throughout the plant 
through conductive vessels formed by 
specialized tissues.
12. Which are the specialized 
conductive tissues of the 
plants?
The vascular tissues of the plants are 
the xylem and the phloem. Xylem is the 
plant tissue that forms the vessels that 
conduct water and mineral salts 
absorbed from the soil to the plant cells. 
Phloem is the plant tissue that forms 
the vessels that conduct dissolved sugar 
from the leaves (where they are 
produced by photosynthesis) to other 
plant cells.
13. What are the cell types 
that form the xylem? What are 
the main features of those 
cells?
The main cells of the xylem are the 
tracheids and the vessel elements 
(these only in angiosperms). The 
tracheids and the vessel elements are 
dead cells that have lost their cytoplasm 
and only their cell wall impregnated with 
lignin (an impermeable biopolymer) 
remained. The tracheids form tubes that 
communicate with neighboring tubes 
through pores; the vessel elements do 
not present pores but instead they 
communicate with the successive vessel 
element through perforations in their 
extremities.
14. What are the cell types 
that form the phloem? What 
are the main features of those 
cells?
The main cells that form the phloem are 
the sieve elements and the companion 
cells. The sieve elements form the 
vessel walls; they are living enucleated 
cells positioned in series forming the 
sieve tubes. Between successive vessel 
elements there are communicating 
pores. The companion cells are located 
outside and alongside the sieve tubes 
and they help in the absorption of the 
material to be transported.
15. What is the vascular 
cambium? What is its 
function?
Vascular cambium is the secondary 
meristematic tissue that in roots and in 
the stem forms the vascular tissues 
(xylem and phloem) of the plant. 
Usually the outer side of the vascular 
cambium produces a layer of phloem 
and the inner (more central) side of the 
tissue produces a layer of xylem.

16. What are vascular 
bundles? How does the 
configuration of the vascular 
bundles within the stem 
differentiate monocots from 
dicots?
Vascular bundles are segments of xylem 
and associated phloem that run 
longitudinally within the stem. In dicots 
the vascular bundles are organized side-
by-side forming concentric rings. In 
monocots the vascular bundles are 
scattered and do not form rings.
17. What are the main plant 
tissues that form the rings 
observed on stem sections of 
some trees?
The rings observed on a stem cross 
section of dicot trees are made of 
conductive tissues: xylem and phloem.
18. How can the age of a tree 
be estimated from the 
analysis of the rings present 
on a cross section of its stem?
For the growth of the tree it is 
necessary to have formation of new 
vessels within the stem, a task 
performed by the vascular cambium. 
The vascular cambium is more active in 
hot seasons (summer and spring) 
generating a lighter band made of large 
calibered vessels. During winter and fall 
the vascular cambium produces the 
opposite, so small calibered vessels and 
a darker band appears outside the 
previous lighter band. Therefore two 
ring bands are made yearly, one lighter 
and the other darker. By a direct count 
of these band pairs one can estimate 
the age of the tree.
19. What are the plant tissues 
that constitute the functional 
structures of the leaf veins?
Leaf veins are made of vascular tissues. 
They are constituted by xylem and 
phloem that respectively conduct water 
and mineral nutrients (xylem) and sugar 
(phloem).
20. Which are the plant 
tissues specialized in 
covering?
The covering tissues, or dermal tissues, 
of the plants are the epidermis (that 
covers the leaves and the young stems 
and shoots) and the periderm (a tissue 
that substitutes the epidermis in stems, 
shoots and roots). The periderm is 
made of phelloderm, phellogen and 
suber (cork).
21. Which are the plant 
tissues that cover the stem 
and the leaves?
The stem may be covered by epidermis 
(having stomata, cuticle and 
photosynthetic cells) as in monocots or, 
alternatively, the epidermis is 
substituted by the periderm

(phelloderm, phellogen and cork) as in 
dicots and gymnosperms.
The leaves are covered by epidermis.
22. What is phellogen? What 
is its function?
Phellogen, also known as cork cambium, 
is the meristematic plant tissue 
responsible for the formation of the 
periderm (the covering of the stem, 
shoots and roots). The inner side of the 
phellogen layer forms the phelloderm 
and its outer side forms the cork 
(suber). The suber secretes suberin, an 
impermeable substance that 
impregnates the tissue.
23. Which type of plant tissue 
is cork?
Cork, the material, for example, used to 
cap wine bottles, is extracted from the 
suber of a special oak called cork oak.
24. What are the plant root 
hairs? Where can they be 
found and what is their 
function?
The root hairs are external elongated 
projections of the root epidermis. Their 
role is to increase the absorption of 
water by the root.
25. Why does bark often die 
and break naturally?
The bark is the mature periderm of the 
stem, branches and roots. It dies and 
breaks when these structures grow and 
thus the peridermal suber formed of 
already dead cells ruptures.
26. What is the leaf cuticle?
The leaf cuticle is a thin waxy layer 
made of cutin and waxes on the outer 
surface of the leaf epidermis. Its 
function is to control the cellular 
transpiration.
27. Which are the plant 
tissues that form the plant 
roots?
The roots have a central portion called 
medulla made of vascular tissue (inner 
xylem and outer phloem). The medulla 
is surrounded by the medullary 
parenchyma and delimited by pericycle, 
a meristem that originates the 
secondary roots (ramifications). 
Externally to the medulla lies the 
cortical portion formed of endodermis 
(that surrounds the pericycle) and 
cortical parenchyma. The covering of 
the roots is epidermis (with root hairs) 
later substituted by suberized (corky) 
periderm.
28. What is the root cap?
The root cap is a protective structure 
located in the tip of the growing root. It 
protects the meristematic tissue of the 
root forming a cap that surrounds the 
tip. The cover is necessary since during

the growth of the root the meristem 
otherwise would be injured by the 
friction with the soil.
29. What are secondary roots? 
In origin how secondary roots 
differentiate from shoots?
Secondary roots are ramifications of the 
primary (main) root. The secondary 
roots emerge from the pericycle, inner 
tissue of the root. The shoots originate 
from the lateral buds of the stem. 
Therefore the origin of the secondary 
roots is endogenous and the origin of 
the shoots is exogenous.
30. Why do roots of many 
swamp plants have a special 
morphology?
Swamp and marsh plants generally 
present supporting roots that ramify 
from portions of the stem above the 
ground helping the plant to fixate down 
the muddy and sandy soil. They may 
also have respiratory roots 
(pneumatophores), structures that 
emerge from buried roots to catch 
oxygen.

Biology Questions and Answers
Plant Physiology
1. Why do plants need to 
exchange gases with the 
environment?
Plants need to do gas exchange because 
they create aerobic cellular respiration 
(like animals) and they need to get 
molecular oxygen and to release carbon 
dioxide. Besides aerobic cellular 
respiration plants still need to get 
carbon dioxide to make photosynthesis 
and to release the molecular oxygen 
that is the product of this reaction.
2. What are the main gas 
exchange organs of the 
plants? How is the process 
accomplished?
In the covering of the leaves and of the 
primary structure of the stem gas 
exchange is made through the cuticle 
and pores of the epidermis. In the 
covering of the secondary structure of 
the stem of woody plants gas exchange 
is made through the lenticels of the 
periderm (small breaches of the cork). 
The gas exchange in plants is 
accomplished by simple diffusion.
3. What is plant transpiration? 
What are the two main types 
of plant transpiration process? 
Which of them is more 
significant in volume?
Transpiration is the loss of water from 
the plant to the atmosphere in the form 
of vapor.
Transpiration occurs through the cuticle 
of the epidermis (cuticular transpiration) 
or through the ostioles of the stomata 
(stomatal transpiration). The most 
important is stomatal transpiration since 
it is more intense and physiologically 
regulated.
4. What are stomata? How do 
these structures participate in 
the plant transpiration?
Stomata (singular, stoma) are small 
specialized passages for water and 
gases present in the epidermis of the 
plants. As the plant needs more or less 
to lose water and heat the stomata 
respectively close or open preventing or 
allowing the passage of gases by 
diffusion.
5. What are the elements that 
constitute the stomata?
The stoma is made of a central opening, 
the ostiole, or slit, delimited by two 
guard cells responsible for its closing or 
opening. A substomatal chamber is 
located under the ostiole.

Biology Questions and Answers
6. How do plants control the 
opening and the closing of the 
stomata?
The opening and the closing of the 
stomata depend upon the necessity of 
the plant to lose water and heat through 
transpiration (exit of water vapor means 
elimination of heat). When the plant has 
excessive water the guard cells become 
turgid and the ostiole opens. When little 
water is available the guard cells 
become flaccid and the ostiole closes.
Water enters and goes out the stomata 
by osmosis.
Other factors like light intensity and 
carbon dioxide concentration in the 
leaves influence the opening and the 
closing of the stomata. When luminosity 
is high the photosynthesis rate 
increases and the stomata open to 
absorb more carbon dioxide from the 
environment and release heat; when 
luminosity is low the stomata tend to 
close. When the carbon dioxide 
concentration in the photosynthetic 
parenchyma is low the stomata open to 
absorb more of the gas and make 
photosynthesis possible; when such 
concentration is high the stomata tend 
to close.
7. Do plants placed under an 
environment drier than the 
habitat where they are used to 
living have an increase or a 
reduction in the time during 
which their stomata remain 
open?
If plants from a moister region were 
transferred to a drier region probably 
their stomata would remain closed for a 
longer time, i.e., the time during which 
stomata are open will be reduced to 
lower the loss of water by transpiration.
8. Why do some plants 
adapted to a dry environment 
open their stomata only at 
night?
During the day in dry habitats the guard 
cells become flaccid and the stomata 
close; concurrently carbon dioxide is 
disallowed to pass to participate in 
diurnal photosynthesis. Some plants 
from dry regions solve this problem 
through the method of nocturnal carbon 
dioxide fixation. At night, when water 
loss by transpiration is lower, the 
stomata open, carbon dioxide enters 
and it is stored within the parenchymal 
tissues. During the day the stored gas is 
mobilized to be used in photosynthesis.
9. How has the position of the 
stomata changed in some 
plants to prevent excessive 
water loss by transpiration?
In some plants that have leaves that 
receive too much sunlight the stomata 
concentrate in the inferior epidermis, so 
their heating is lower and less water is 
lost by stomatal transpiration. In other 
plants of dry environments the stomata 
group in some regions of the leaf; over 
the surface of these areas the water 
concentration of the air is higher 
comparing to the environment and the

Biology Questions and Answers
loss of water by transpiration is thus 
reduced. Some plants of dry climates 
also have stomata within cavities.
10. Is transpiration the only 
way through which leaves lose 
water?
Plants do not only lose water as vapor, 
as by transpiration. The leaves also lose 
liquid water by a phenomenon known as 
gutation. Gutation takes place through 
structures called hydathodes similar to 
stomata. Gutation mainly occurs when 
transpiration is difficult due to high air 
humidity or when the plant is placed in 
a watery soil.
11. When air humidity is high 
does the plant transpiration 
increase or lower?
When air humidity is high transpiration 
diminishes. Since transpiration is a 
simple diffusion process it depends upon 
the concentration gradient of water 
between the plant and the environment. 
If the atmosphere has too much water 
vapor the gradient becomes lower or 
even reversed.
12. How do the water 
absorption volume and the 
water transpiration volume 
comparatively vary in plants 
in a day? What is the final 
comparative balance of these 
processes?
During the day the transpired volume of 
water is higher than the volume 
absorbed by the roots. At night the 
situation reverses and the roots absorb 
more water than the transpired volume.
It is observed that the transpired and 
the absorbed volumes practically equal 
in a day.
13. How do plants solve the 
problem of transporting 
substances throughout their 
tissues?
In bryophytes the substance transport is 
done by diffusion. In tracheophytes 
(pteridophytes, gymnosperms and 
angiosperms) there are specialized 
conductive vessels, the xylem that 
carries water and mineral salts and the 
phloem that conducts organic material 
(sugar).
14. Is transportation of gases 
in tracheophytes made 
through the vascular tissues?
Carbon dioxide and oxygen are not 
transported through the xylem or 
phloem. These gases reach the cells and 
exit the plant by diffusion through 
intercellular spaces or between 
neighboring cells.

Biology Questions and Answers
15. Are the xylem and the 
phloem made of living cells?
The cells that constitute the xylem ducts 
are dead cells killed by lignin deposition. 
The cells of the phloem are living cells.
16. What is the importance of 
lignin for the xylem 
formation?
Lignin is important because it is 
deposited on the cell wall of the xylem 
cells providing impermeability and 
rigidity to the xylem vessels.
17. What is root pressure?
Root pressure is the pressure that 
forces water from the soil to be 
absorbed by the xylem of the root. It is 
due to the osmotic gradient between the 
interior of the root and the soil.
18. What is capillarity? How is 
this phenomenon chemically 
explained? What is the 
relevance of capillarity for 
water transport in plants?
Capillarity is the phenomenon through 
which water moves inside extremely 
thin tubes (capillaries) aided by the 
attraction between water molecules and 
the capillary wall. The capillarity 
phenomenon is possible because water 
is a polar molecule and forms 
intermolecular hydrogen bonds. 
Therefore there is electrical attraction 
(adhesion force) between the capillary 
wall and the water molecules that then 
pull each other (cohesion force) since 
they are bound. Not just water but 
other liquids may move inside capillaries 
by capillarity.
Capillarity is not too relevant for the 
transport of water in plants. It 
contributes only to a few centimeters of 
ascension.
19. What are the forces that 
make water to flow within the 
xylem from the roots to the 
leaves?
Water enters the roots due to the root 
pressure and a water column is 
maintained within the xylem from the 
roots to the leaves. The most important 
factor that makes water ascend is 
transpiration, mainly in the leaves. As 
leaves lose water by transpiration their 
cells tend to attract more water creating 
suction inside the xylem. The cohesion 
property of water that keeps its 
molecules bound (one pulls the other) 
by hydrogen bonds helps the process.
20. What is tree girdling? 
What happens to a plant when 
that girdle is removed from 
the stem (below the 
branches)?
Malpighi’s girdling, or tree girdling, is 
the removal from a stem of a complete 
external girdle containing the phloem

Biology Questions and Answers
(that is more external) but preserving 
the xylem (that is more internal).
When a girdle like that is removed 
below the branches the plant dies 
because organic food (sugar) is 
disallowed to pass to the region below 
the girdle and thus roots die from the 
lack of nutrients. Since roots die the 
plant does not get water and mineral 
salts and dies too.
21. What are plant hormones?
Plant hormones, also called 
phytohormones, are substances that 
control the embryonic development and 
the growth of the adult plant.
22. What are the main natural 
plant hormones and what are 
their respective effects?
The main natural plant hormones and 
their respective functions are the 
following:
Auxins (the best known natural auxin is 
IAA, indoleacetic acid): their function is 
to promote plant growth, distension and 
cellular differentiation. Gibberellins: 
have action similar to auxins (growth 
and distension), stimulate flowering and 
fruit formation and activate seed 
germination. Cytokinins: increase 
cellular division rate and together with 
auxins help growth and tissue 
differentiation, slow the plant aging. 
Ethylene (ethene): a gas released by 
plants that participates in the growth 
process and has noteworthy role in fruit 
ripening and in leaf abscission.
23. What is the plant 
coleoptile? Why does the 
removal of the coleoptile 
extremity disallow plant 
growth?
Coleoptile is the first (one or more) 
aerial structure of the sprouting plant 
that emerges from the seed. It encloses 
the young stem and the first leaves, 
protecting them.
The top of the coleoptile generally is the 
region where auxins are made. If this 
region is removed, plant growth stops 
since auxins are necessary to promote 
growth and tissue differentiation.
24. What is indolacetic acid 
(IAA)?
Indolacetic acid (indolyl-3-acetic acid), 
or IAA, is the main natural auxin made 
by plants. It promotes plant growth and 
cellular differentiation.
25. What are synthetic auxins 
and what are their uses?
Synthetic auxins, like indolebutyric acid 
(IBA) and naphthalenic acid (NAA) are 
substances similar to IAA (a natural 
auxin) but artificially made. Some are 
used to accelerate methods of asexual 
reproduction (like grafting or budding) 
and others are even used as herbicides 
since they selectively kill some plants 
(mainly dicots).

Biology Questions and Answers
26. Where in plants is a large 
amount of IAA found?
Auxins are produced and found in large 
amount in the apical buds of the stem 
and shoots and in the young leaves.
27. How do phytohormones 
help the development of 
parthenocarpic fruits?
Parthenocarpic fruits are those produced 
without fecundation. Some plants 
naturally make parthenocarpic fruits, 
like the banana tree, stimulated by their 
own hormones.
Angiosperms that do not naturally 
produce parthenocarpic fruits may do it 
if auxins are applied to flowers before 
fecundation. Therefore even without 
fecundation the ovaries grow and fruits 
are formed although seedless.
28. How do auxins act helping 
the lateral (secondary) 
growth of the stem?
Auxins stimulate the formation of 
conductive vessels, xylem and phloem, 
promoting the thickening of the stem.
29. What happens when the 
auxin concentration in some 
structures of the plant is over 
the action range of the 
hormone?
In some parts of the plant (stem, roots, 
lateral buds) there are auxin 
concentration ranges in which the 
hormonal action is positive (stimulate 
growth). It is observed that 
concentrations over the superior limit of 
those ranges have the opposite effect 
(inhibition of growth).
30. What is the phenomenon 
of apical dominance in plants? 
How can it be artificially 
eliminated?
Apical dominance is the phenomenon 
through which high (over the positive 
range limit) auxin concentrations due to 
auxins from the apical bud moving 
downward the stem inhibit the growth 
of the lateral buds of the plant. At the 
beginning of the stem development the 
apical dominance causes the plant 
growth to be longitudinal (upwards) 
since the growth of the lateral buds 
remains inhibited. As the lateral buds 
become more distant from the apex the 
auxin concentration in these buds 
lowers and shoots grow more easily.
The growth of tree branches can be 
stimulated preventing the apical 
dominance through the removal of the 
apical bud.
31. What are gibberellins? 
Where are they produced?
Gibberellins are plant hormones that 
stimulate plant growth, flowering and 
fruit formation (also parthenocarpy) and 
the germination of seeds. There are 
more than 70 known types of

gibberellins. Gibberellins are made in 
the apical buds and in young leaves.
32. What are cytokinins? 
Where are they made?
Cytokinins are phytohormones active in 
the promotion of cellular division, they 
slow down the aging of tissues and act 
together with auxins stimulating plant 
growth. Cytokinins are produced by the 
root meristem and distributed through 
the xylem.
33. What is the plant hormone 
remarkable for stimulating 
flowering and fruit ripening? 
What are the uses and 
practical inconveniences of 
that hormone?
The plant hormone notable for 
stimulating and accelerating fruit 
ripening is the gas ethylene (ethene). 
By being a gas, ethylene acts not only 
in the plant that produces it but also in 
neighboring ones.
Some fruit processing industries use 
ethylene to accelerate fruit ripening. On 
the other hand, if the intensification or 
acceleration of fruit ripening is not 
desirable care must be taken to prevent 
the mixture of ripe fruits that release 
ethylene with the others.
34. Are the development and 
growth of plants only 
influenced by plant hormones?
Physical and chemical environmental 
factors, like intensity and position of 
light in relation to the plant, 
gravitational force, temperature, 
mechanical pressures and chemical 
composition of the soil and of the 
atmosphere, can also influence the 
growth and development of plants.
35. What are plant tropisms?
Tropisms are movements caused by 
external stimulus. In Botany the studied 
plant tropisms are: phototropism 
(tropism in response to light), 
geotropism (tropism in response to the 
earth gravity) and thigmotropism 
(tropism in response to mechanical 
stimulus).
36. To which direction does 
the growth of one side of a 
stem, branch or root induce 
the structure to curve?
Whenever one side of a stem, branch or 
root grows more than the other side the 
structure curves towards the side that 
grows less. (This is an important 
concept for plant tropism problems.)
37. What is phototropism?
Phototropism is the movement of plant 
structures in response to light. 
Phototropism may be positive or 
www.biology-questions-and-answers.com

negative. Positive phototropism is that 
in which the plant movement (or 
growth) is towards the light source and 
negative phototropism is that in which 
the movement (or growth) is inverse, 
away from the light source.
Phototropism relates to auxins since the 
exposition of one side of the plant to 
light makes these hormones 
concentrate in the darker side. This fact 
makes the auxin action upon the stem 
to be positive, i.e., the growth of the 
darker side is more intense and the 
plant arcs towards the lighter side. In 
the root (when submitted to light, in 
general experimentally) the auxin action 
is negative (over the positive range), 
the growth of the darker side is 
inhibited and the root curves towards 
this side.
38. What are the types of 
plant geotropisms? Why do 
the stem and the root present 
opposite geotropisms?
The types of geotropisms are the 
positive geotropism, that in which the 
plant grows in favor of the gravitational 
force, as for example in roots, and the 
negative geotropism, that against the 
gravitational force, for example, in the 
stem.
Root geotropism and stem geotropism 
are opposed due to different 
sensitivities to auxin concentration in 
these structures. The following 
experiment can demonstrate the 
phenomenon: Stem and root are placed 
in a horizontal position (parallel to the 
ground) and naturally auxins 
concentrate along their bottom part. 
Under this condition it is observed that 
the stem grows upwards and the root 
grows downwards. This happens 
because in the stem the high auxin 
concentration in the bottom makes this 
side grow (longitudinally) more and the 
structures arcs upwards. In the root the 
high auxin concentration in the bottom 
inhibits the growth of this side and the 
upper side grows more making the root 
to curve downwards.
39. What is thigmotropism?
Thigmotropism is the movement or 
growth of the plant in response to 
mechanical stimuli (touch or physical 
contact), as when a plant grows around 
a supporting rod. It occurs for example 
in grape and passionfruit vines, etc.
40. What is photoperiod?
Photoperiod is the daily time period of 
light exposure of a living being. The 
photoperiod may vary according to the 
period of the year.
41. What is photoperiodism?
Photoperiodism is the biological 
response presented by some living 
beings to their daily time of light 
exposure (photoperiod).

42. What are the plant organs 
responsible for the perception 
of light variation? What is the 
pigment responsible for this 
perception?
Leaves are mainly responsible for 
perception of light intensity in plants. 
The pigment that performs this 
perception and commands 
photoperiodism is called phytochrome.
43. How does the 
photoperiodism affect the 
flowering of some plants?
Flowering is a typical and easy to 
observe example of photoperiodism. 
Most flowering plants flower only during 
specific periods of the year or when 
placed under some conditions of daily 
illumination. This occurs because their 
blossoming depends on the duration of 
the photoperiod that in its turn varies 
with the season of the year. Flowering is 
also affected by exposition to certain 
temperatures.
44. What is the critical 
photoperiod? How can the 
critical photoperiod relate to 
flowering be experimentally 
determined?
The critical photoperiod is the limit of 
the photoperiod duration for the 
occurrence of some biological response. 
This limit can be a maximum or a 
minimum, according to the 
characteristics of the biological response 
and to the studied plant.
To determine the critical photoperiod 
relating to flowering, 24 groups of 
plants of the same species can be taken 
and the following experiment can be 
done: Each group is submitted to a 
different photoperiod, the first group to 
1 hour of daily exposure to light, the 
second to 2 hours, the third to 3 hours, 
and so on, until the last group is 
exposed to 24 hours. It is observed 
later that beyond a specific duration of 
light exposure plants present or do not 
present flowering and the remaining 
submitted to a shorter photoperiod 
present opposite behavior. The duration 
of the light exposure that separates 
these two groups is the critical 
photoperiod.
45. How do plants classify 
according to their 
photoperiodism-based 
flowering?
According to their photoperiodism-based 
flowering plants classify as long-day 
plants, those that depend on longer 
photoperiods than the critical 
photoperiod to flower, as short-day 
plants, those that depend on shorter 
photoperiods than the critical 
photoperiod to flower, and as indifferent 
plants, whose flowering does not 
depend on the photoperiod.

present opposite phyllotaxis?
Phyllotaxis is the way leaves are 
arranged on shoots. Most plants have 
opposite phyllotaxis (alternating in 
sequence, one in one side of the shoot, 
the following in the opposite side) as a 
solution to prevent self shading of the 
leaves thus improving the efficiency of 
photosynthesis.

Genetic Concepts
1. What is a gene?
A gene is a sequence of DNA 
nucleotides that codifies the production 
of a protein.
2. Is a gene a triplet of 
consecutive DNA nucleotides?
A gene is not a triplet of DNA 
nucleotides with their respective 
nitrogen-containing bases, like AAG or 
CGT. The nucleotide triplets may be 
pieces of genes but not genes.
A gene is a portion of a DNA molecule 
that codifies a specific protein. Thus it is 
formed by several DNA nucleotide 
triplets.
3. How is the concept of 
chromosome related to the 
concept of the gene?
A chromosome is a DNA molecule. A 
chromosome may contain several 
different genes and also DNA portions 
that are not genes.
4. What is meant by “gene 
locus”?
Gene locus (locus means place) is the 
location of a gene in a chromosome, 
i.e., the position of the gene in a DNA 
molecule.
5. What are alleles of a gene?
Diploid individuals have paired 
chromosomes. For example in humans 
there are 23 pairs of chromosomes 
totaling 46 chromosomes. Each pair 
comprehends homologous 
chromosomes, one chromosome from 
the father and another from the mother, 
both of them containing information 
related to the production of the same 
proteins (with the exception of the sex 
chromosomes, which are partially 
heterologous). So in the diploid 
individual it is said that each gene has 
two alleles, one in each chromosome of 
the homologous pair.
6. Are the alleles of a gene 
necessarily originated one 
from the father and the other 
from the mother? Are there 
exceptions?
It is natural that alleles have come one 
from the father and the other from the 
mother but it is not obligatory. In a 
“clone” generated by nucleus 
transplantation technology, for example, 
the alleles come from a single 
individual. In polysomies (as in trisomy 
21) each gene of the affected 
chromosome has three alleles, in 
trisomies, or four, in tetrasomies.

Biology Questions and Answers
7. What is a phenotype?
A phenotype is every observable 
characteristic of a living being 
conditioned by its genes. Some 
phenotypes may be altered by 
nongenetic factors (for example, 
artificial hair coloring). Specific 
phenotypes are also called phenotypical 
traits.
8. What is a genotype? What 
is the difference between 
genotype and phenotype?
Genotype is the genes, DNA nucleotide 
sequences contained in the 
chromosomes of an individual, that 
condition the phenotype. Phenotypes 
then are a biological manifestation of 
genotypes.
For example, the altered hemoglobin 
chain of sickle cell disease and the 
manifestation of the disease itself are 
the phenotype. The altered DNA 
nucleotide sequence in the gene that 
codifies the production of that abnormal 
hemoglobin chain is the genotype.
9. Does the environment exert 
an influence on the 
phenotype?
A phenotype may be altered (compared 
to the original situation conditioned by 
its genotype) by nongenetic means. 
Examples: some hormones may cease 
to be secreted due to diseases but the 
genes that determine their secretion 
remain intact; a person can go to a 
hairdresser and change the color of 
his/her hair; plastic surgery can be 
performed to alter facial features of an 
individual; colored contact lenses may 
be worn; a plant can grow beyond its 
genetically conditioned size by 
application of phytohormones.
Revealing cases of environmental 
influence on phenotypes are observed in 
monozygotic twins that have grown in 
different places. Generally these twins 
present very distinct phenotypical 
features due to the environmental and 
cultural differences of the places where 
they lived and to their different 
individual experiences in life.
(Biologically programmed phenotypical 
changes, like nonpathological changes 
of the skin color caused by sunlight 
exposure, tanning, or the variation of 
the color of some flowers according to 
the pH of the soil cannot be considered 
independent from the genotype. 
Actually these changes are planned by 
the genotype as natural adaptations to 
environmental changes.)
10. Are environmental 
phenotypical changes 
transmitted to the offspring?
Changes caused on phenotypes by the 
environment are not transmitted to the 
offspring (unless their primary cause is 
genotypical change in germ cells or in 
gametic cells). If a person changes the 
color of the hair or undergoes aesthetic 
plastic surgery the resulting features are 
not transmitted to his/her offspring.

11. What are the situations in 
which the environment can 
alter the genotype of an 
individual? What is the 
condition for this type of 
change to be transmitted to 
the offspring?
The environment can only alter 
genotypes when its action causes 
alterations in the genetic material 
(mutations) of the individual, i.e., 
deletion, addition or substitution of 
entire chromosomes or of nucleotides 
that form the DNA molecules.
Mutations are only transmitted to the 
offspring when affecting the germ cells 
that produce gametes or the gametes 
themselves.
12. What are some examples 
of phenotypical characteristics 
that present two or more 
varieties and of phenotypical 
features that do not vary? In 
relation to the genes 
correspondent to those 
characteristics that vary 
among individuals what can 
be expected about their 
alleles?
Color of the eyes, color of the hair, color 
of the skin, height, blood type are 
examples of phenotypical features that 
present two or more varieties. Other 
examples are the color of flowers and 
seeds in some plants, the sex of the 
individual in dioecius species, etc. 
Examples of phenotypical characteristics 
that do not present variation among 
individuals of the same species are: in 
general the number of limbs, the 
anatomical position of the organs, the 
general constitution of tissues and cells, 
etc.
Phenotype possibility of presenting 
natural variations (in beings of the same 
species) are necessarily determined by 
two or more different alleles of the 
correspondent gene. These different 
alleles combine and form different 
genotypes that condition the different 
phenotypes (variations).
13. Considering a pair of 
homologous chromosomes 
containing a gene having two 
different alleles how many 
different genotypes can the 
individual present?
If a gene of a diploid species has 
different alleles, for example, A and A’, 
the possible genotypes are: A’A’, AA, 
and AA’. So any of these three different 
genotypes may be the genotype of an 
individual.
14. For an individual having a 
genotype formed of two 
different alleles that condition 
different varieties of the same 
phenotypical trait, upon what 
will the phenotypical feature 
actually manifested depend?

different alleles (common situation), for

Biology Questions and Answers
example, A and A’, three types of 
genotypes may be formed: AA, A’A’ and 
AA’. The question refers to an individual 
bearing a genotype made of two 
different alleles, so it is the AA’ 
genotype (the heterozygous individual).
This AA’ individual may manifest the 
phenotype conditioned by the allele A or 
the phenotype conditioned by the allele 
A’ or still a mixed phenotype of those 
two forms. If the allele A is dominant 
over the allele A’ the form conditioned 
by A will manifest. If A’ is the dominant 
allele, the form determined by A’ will 
manifest. This phenomenon is known as 
dominance and occurs because the 
recessive (nondominant) allele 
manifests only when present in double 
in the genotype (in homozygosity), 
while the dominant allele manifests 
even when in heterozygosity. If none of 
the alleles dominate a mixture of the 
two varieties conditioned by both alleles 
appears or instead a third form may 
come out.
15. What is the difference 
between dominant allele and 
recessive allele?
Dominant allele is the allele that 
determines phenotypical features that 
manifest in homozygous or 
heterozygous genotypes.
In Genetics the dominant allele is 
represented in uppercase, e.g., “A”, and 
its recessive allele is written in 
lowercase, “a”.
In molecular terms generally the 
recessive allele has a nucleotide 
sequence previously identical to the 
corresponding sequence in the dominant 
allele but that during evolution was 
inactivated by mutation. This fact 
explains the expression of the dominant 
phenotype in heterozygosity (since one 
functional allele is still present).
16. Whenever a pair of alleles 
has different alleles is there 
dominance between them?
Not in all cases of a gene having two 
different alleles is the dominance 
complete. There are genes in which 
heterozygosity occurs with incomplete 
dominance (manifestation of an 
intermediate phenotype in relation to 
the homozygous, like in the color of 
roses, between white and red) and 
other genes that present codominance 
(expression of a third different feature, 
as in the MN blood group system).
17. What is the difference 
between homozygosity and 
heterozygosity?
Homozygosity occurs when an individual 
has two identical alleles of a gene, for 
example, AA or aa. Heterozygosity 
occurs when an individual has two 
different alleles of the same gene, in the 
example, Aa.

Biology Questions and Answers
18. Why can it be said that a 
recessive allele can remain 
hidden in the phenotype of an 
individual and revealed only 
when manifested in 
homozygosity in the 
offspring?
A recessive allele can remain hidden 
because it does not manifest in 
heterozygous individual, i.e., it may be 
present in the genotype but not 
expressed in the phenotype. When this 
allele is transmitted to the offspring and 
forms homozygous genotype with 
another recessive allele from other 
chromosomal lineage the phenotypical 
characteristics that come out reveal its 
existence.

Biology Questions and Answers
Mendel's Laws
1. Who was Gregor Mendel?
Mendel is considered the father of 
Genetics. He was a monk, biologist and 
botanist born in Austria in 1822 and 
who died in 1884. During the years 
1853 to 1863 he cultivated pea plants in 
the gardens of his monastery to be used 
in his research. His experiments 
consisted of crossing pea plants of 
distinct characteristics (size, color of the 
seeds, etc.), cataloging the results and 
interpreting them. The experiments led 
him to enunciate his laws, results 
published in 1886 with no scientific 
repercussion at that time. Only at the 
beginning of the 20th century, in 1902, 
18 years after his death, were his merits 
broadly recognized.
2. What in Genetics is 
hybridization?
Hybridization in Genetics is the crossing 
of individuals from “pure” and different 
lineages in relation to a given trait, i.e., 
the crossing of different homozygous for 
the studied trait.
In Mendel’s experiments with peas, for 
example, a plant from a green pea 
lineage obtained from self fecundation 
of its ascendants through several 
generations was crossed (cross 
fecundation) with another plant from a 
yellow lineage also obtained by self 
fecundation of ascendants. (The self 
fecundation through several generations 
of ascendants and the exclusive 
obtainment of individuals with the 
desired characteristics ensured that the 
individuals of the parental generation 
were “pure”, i.e., homozygous for that 
characteristic.)
3. What is monohybridism?
Monohybridism is the study of only one 
characteristic in the crossing of two pure 
individuals (hybridization) for that 
characteristic.
4. Considering hybridization in 
a trait like the color of the 
flowers of a given plant 
species (red dominant/ yellow 
recessive) conditioned by a 
pair of different alleles, what 
are the phenotypical results of 
the first generation (F1) and 
the phenotypical results of the 
second generation (F2, formed 
by crossing among F1 
genotypes)? What are the 
phenotypical proportions in F1 
and F2?
In relation to genotypes and phenotypes 
the hybridization comprises of: parental 
generation (P): RR (read), yy (yellow). 
F1 generation (RR x yy): Ry (red). F2 
generation (Ry x Ry): RR (red), Ry 
(red), Ry (red) and yy (yellow).
In the F1 generation the proportion of 
red flowers is 100%. In the F2

generation, the phenotypical proportion 
is three red (75%) to one yellow (25%).
5. Considering hybridization in 
a trait like the color of the 
flowers of a given plant 
species (red/yellow) 
conditioned by a pair of 
different alleles in relation to 
complete dominance (red 
dominant/ yellow recessive), 
why in the F1 generation is 
one of the colors missing?
In this monohybridism one of the colors 
does not appear in the F1 generation 
because their parental generators are 
pure, i.e., homozygous, and in F1 all 
descendants are heterozygous (each 
parental individual forms only one type 
of gamete). Since only heterozygous 
genotypes appear and red is dominant 
over yellow the individuals of the F1 
generation will present only red flowers.
6. Considering hybridization in 
a given trait like the color of 
the hair of a mammalian 
species (white/black) 
conditioned by a pair of 
different alleles under 
complete dominance (black 
dominant, B/ white recessive, 
w), how can the phenotypical 
proportion obtained in the F2 
generation be explained? 
What is this proportion?
In the monohybridism conditioned by 
two different alleles the F1 generation 
presents only heterozygous individuals 
(Bw). In F2 there is one individual BB, 
two individuals Bw and one individual 
ww. In relation to the phenotype there 
are in F2 two black individuals and one 
white individual, since black is the 
dominant color. So the proportion is 
3:1, three black-haired to one white-
haired.
7. What is meant by saying 
that in relation to a given trait 
conditioned by a gene with 
two different alleles the 
gametes are always “pure”?
To say that gametes are pure means 
that they always carry only one allele of 
the referred trait. Gametes are always 
“pure” because in them the 
chromosomes are not homologous, they 
contain only one chromosome of each 
type.
8. What is the Mendel’s first 
law?
The Mendel’s first law postulates that a 
characteristic (trait) of an individual is 
always determined by two factors, one 
inherited from the father and the other 
from the mother and the direct offspring 
of the individual receives from it only 
one of these factors (aleatory). In other 
words, each trait is determined by two 
factors that segregate during gamete 
formation.

Biology Questions and Answers
The Mendel’s first law is also known as 
the law of purity of gametes. Mendel 
deduced the way genes and alleles were 
transmitted and traits were conditioned 
without even knowing of the existence 
of these elements.
9. Which is the type of gamete 
(for a given trait) produced by 
a dominant homozygous 
individual? What is the 
genotypical proportion of 
these gametes? What about a 
recessive homozygous 
individual?
If an individual is dominant 
homozygous, for example, AA, it will 
produce only gametes having the allele 
A. The proportion thus is 100% of AA 
gametes.
If an individual is recessive 
homozygous, for example, aa, it will 
produce only gametes having the allele 
a, also in a 100% proportion.
10. Which is the type of 
gamete produced by a 
heterozygous individual? 
What is the genotypical 
proportion of these gametes?
Heterozygous individuals, for example, 
AA, produce two different types of 
gametes: one containing the allele A 
and another type containing the allele a. 
The proportion is 1:1.
11. In the F2 generation of a 
hybridization for a given trait 
conditioned by a pair of alleles 
T and t, according to Mendel’s 
first law what are the 
genotypes of each 
phenotypical form? How many 
respectively are the 
genotypical and phenotypical 
forms?
In the mentioned hybridization the 
genotypical forms in F2 will be TT, tt 
and Tt. Therefore there will be three 
different genotypical forms and two 
different phenotypical forms 
(considering T dominant over t).
12. Why can the crossing of an 
individual that manifests 
dominant phenotype with 
another that manifests 
recessive phenotype (for the 
same trait) determine 
whether the dominant 
individual is homozygous or 
heterozygous?
From the crossing of an individual 
having recessive phenotype with 
another having dominant phenotype (for 
the same trait) it is possible to 
determine whether the dominant 
individual is homozygous or 
heterozygous. This is true because the 
genotype of the recessive individual is 
obligatorily homozygous, for example, 
aa. If the other individual is also 
homozygous, AA, the F1 offspring will 
be only heterozygous (aa x AA = only 
Aa). If the other individual is

Biology Questions and Answers
heterozygous there will be two different 
genotypical forms, Aa and aa in the 1:1 
proportion. So if a recessive phenotype 
appears in the direct offspring the 
parental individual that manifests 
dominant phenotype is certainly 
heterozygous.
13. What is a genetic family 
tree?
Genetic family tree is a schematic family 
tree that shows the biological 
inheritance of some trait through 
successive generations.
Genetic family trees are useful because 
it is practically impossible and ethically 
unacceptable to make experimental 
crossings for genetic testing between 
human beings. With the help of family 
tress the study is made by analysis of 
marriages (and crossings) that have 
already occurred in the past. From the 
analysis of family trees, for example, 
information on probabilities of the 
emergence of some phenotype and 
genotypes (including genetic diseases) 
in the offspring of a couple can be 
obtained.
14. What are the main 
conventional symbols and 
signs used in genetic family 
trees?
In genetic family trees the male sex is 
usually represented by a square and the 
female by a circle. Crossings are 
indicated by horizontal lines that 
connect squares to circles and their 
direct offspring are listed below and 
connected to that line. The presence of 
the studied phenotypical form is 
indicated by a complete hachure 
(shading) of the circle or the square 
correspondent to the affected individual. 
It is useful to enumerate the individuals 
from left to right and from top to 
bottom for easy reference.
15. What are the three main 
steps for a good study of a 
genetic family tree?
Step 1: to determine whether the 
studied phenotypical form has a 
dominant or recessive pattern. Step 2: 
to identify recessive homozygous 
individuals. Step 3: to identify the 
remaining genotypes.
16. What is Mendel’s second 
law?
Mendel’s second law postulates that two 
or more different traits are also 
conditioned by two or more pair of 
different factors and that each inherited 
pair separates independently from the 
others. In other words, gametes are 
formed always with an aleatory 
representative of each pair of the 
factors that determine phenotypical 
characteristics.
Mendel’s second law is also known as 
the law of independent segregation of 
factors, or law of independent 
assortment.

Biology Questions and Answers
17. What is the condition for 
Mendel’s second law to be 
valid?
Mendel’s second law is only valid for 
genes located in different chromosomes. 
For genes situated in the same 
chromosome, i.e., linked genes (genes 
in linkage) the law is not valid since the 
segregation of these genes is not 
independent.
18. According to Mendel’s 
second law, in the crossing 
between homozygous 
individuals concerning two 
pairs of nonlinked alleles, 
AABB x aaBB, what are the 
genotypical and phenotypical 
proportions in F1 and F2?
Parental genotypes: AABB, aaBB. 
Gametes from the parental generation: 
Ab and aB. Thus F1 will present 100% 
AaBb gametes (and the phenotypical 
correspondent form).
As F1 are AaBb individuals the gametes 
from their crossing can be: AB, Ab, aB 
and ab. The casual combination of these 
gametes forms the following genotypical 
forms: one AABB, two AABb, two AaBb, 
four AaBB, one Aabb, one Aabb, one 
aaBB, two aaBb and two aabb. The 
phenotypical proportion then would be: 
nine A_B_ (double dominant); three 
A_bb (dominant for the first pair, 
recessive for the second); three aaB_ 
(recessive for the first pair, dominant 
for the second); one aabb (double 
recessive).
19. Considering independent 
segregation of all factors, how 
many types of gametes does a 
VvXXWwYyzz individual 
produce? What is the formula 
to determinate such number?
The mentioned individual will produce 
eight different types of gametes 
(attention, gametes and not zygotes). 
To determine the number of different 
gametes produced by a given multiple 
genotype the number of heterezygous 
pairs is counted (in the mentioned case, 
three) and the result is placed as an 
exponent of two (in the example, 23 = 
8).
20. How is it possible to 
obtain the probability of 
emergence of a given 
genotype formed of more than 
one pair of different alleles 
with independent segregation 
from the knowledge of the 
parental genotypes?
Taking as example the crossing of 
AaBbCc with aaBBCc, for each 
considered pair of allele it is possible to 
verify which genotypes it can form (as 
in an independent analysis) and in 
which proportion. AA x aa: Aa, aa (1:1). 
Bb x BB: BB, Bb (1:1). Cc x Cc: CC, Cc, 
cc (1:2:1). The genotype to which the 
probability is to be determined is for 
example aaBbcc. For each pair of this 
genotype the formation probability is 
determined: to aa, 0.5; to Bb, 0.5; to 
cc, 0.25. The final result is obtained by 
multiplication of these partial 
probabilities, 0.5 x 0.5 x, 0.5, resulting 
0.0625.

Biology Questions and Answers
Non-mendelian 
Inheritance
1. According to Mendel’s law 
phenotypical characteristics 
would be determined by pair 
of factors (alleles) that 
separate independently in 
gametes. What are the main 
types of inheritances that are 
exceptions to Mendel’s rules?
There are many types of inheritance 
that do not follow the mendelian 
pattern. Notable among them are: 
multiple alleles, gene interactions 
(complementary genes, epistasis and 
quantitative, or polygenic, inheritance), 
linkage with or without crossing over 
and sex-linked inheritance.
Pleiotropy, lacking of dominance and 
lethal genes do not fit as variations of 
inheritance since genes can have these 
behaviors and at the same time obey 
mendelian laws.
Mutations and aneuploidies are 
abnormalities that also alter the 
mendelian pattern of inheritance as well 
as mitochondrial inheritance (passage of 
mitochondrial DNA from the mother 
through the cytoplasm of the egg cell to 
the offspring).
2. What is the genetic 
condition in which the 
heterozygous individual has 
different phenotype from the 
homozygous individual?
This condition is called lack of 
dominance and it can happen in two 
ways: incomplete dominance or 
codominance.
In incomplete dominance the 
heterozygous presents an intermediate 
phenotype between the two types of 
homozygous, as in sickle cell anemia in 
which the heterozygous produces some 
sick red blood cells and some normal 
red blood cells. Codominance occurs, for 
example, in the genetic determination of 
the MN blood group system, in which 
the heterozygous has a phenotype 
totally different from the homozygous, 
not being an intermediate form.
3. What is pleiotropy?
Pleiotropy (or pliotropy) is the 
phenomenon in which a single gene 
conditions several different phenotypical 
traits.
Some phenotypical traits may be 
sensitive to pleiotropic effects (for 
example, inhibition) of other genes, 
even when conditioned by a pair of 
alleles in simple dominance. In these 
cases a mixture of pleiotropy and gene 
interaction is characterized.

Biology Questions and Answers
4. What are lethal genes?
Lethal genes are genes having at least 
one allele that, when present in the 
genotype of an individual, causes death. 
There are recessive lethal alleles and 
dominant lethal alleles. (There are also 
genes having alleles that are dominant 
when in heterozygosity but lethal when 
in homozygosity, i.e., the dominance 
related to the phenotype does not 
correspond to the dominance related to 
lethality.)
5. What are multiple alleles? 
Is there dominance in multiple 
alleles?
Multiple alleles is the phenomenon in 
which the same gene has more than 
two different alleles (in normal 
mendelian inheritance the gene has only 
two alleles). Obviously these alleles 
combine in pairs to form the genotypes.
In multiple alleles relative dominance 
among the alleles may exist. A typical 
example of multiple alleles is the 
inheritance of the ABO blood group 
system, in which there are three alleles 
(A, B or O, or IA, IB and i). IA is 
dominant over i, which is recessive in 
relation to the other IB allele. IA and IB 
lack dominance between themselves.
Another example is the color of rabbit 
fur, conditioned by four different alleles 
(C, Cch, Ch and c). In this case the 
dominance relations are C > Cch > Ch 
> c (the symbol > means “dominates 
over”).
6. What are gene interactions? 
What are the three main types 
of gene interactions?
Gene interaction is the phenomenon in 
which a given phenotypical trait is 
conditioned by two or more genes (do 
not confuse with multiple alleles in 
which there is a single gene having 
three or more alleles).
The three main types of gene 
interaction are: complementary genes, 
epistasis and polygenic inheritance (or 
quantitative inheritance).
7. What are complementary 
genes? Does this inheritance 
pattern obey Mendel’s second 
law?
Complementary genes are different 
genes that act together to determine a 
given phenotypical trait.
For example, consider a phenotypical 
trait conditioned by 2 complementary 
genes whose alleles are respectively X, 
x, Y and y. Performing hybridization in 
F2 4 different phenotypical forms are 
obtained: X_Y_ (double dominant), 
X_yy (dominant for the first pair, 
recessive for the second), xxY_ 
(recessive for the first pair, dominant 
for the second) and xxyy (double 
recessive). This is what happens, for 
example, regarding the color of 
budgerigar feathers, in which the double 
dominant interaction results in green 
feathers, the dominant for the first pair, 
recessive for the second interaction 
results in yellow feathers, the recessive 
for the first pair, dominant for the

Transaction ID: 4KS71350WY6468607

Biology Questions and Answers
second interaction leads to blue feathers 
and the double recessive interaction 
leads to white feathers.
Each complementary gene segregates 
independently from the others since 
they are located in different 
chromosomes. Therefore the pattern 
follows Mendel’s second law (although it 
does not obey Mendel’s first law).
8. What is epistasis? What is 
the difference between 
dominant epistasis and 
recessive epistasis?
Epistasis is the gene interaction in which 
a gene (the epistatic gene) can disallow 
the phenotypical manifestation of 
another gene (the hypostatic gene). In 
dominant epistasis the inhibitor allele is 
the dominant allele (for example, I) of 
the epistatic gene so inhibition occurs in 
dominant homozygosity (II) or in 
heterozygosity (Ii). In recessive 
epistasis the inhibitor allele is the 
recessive allele of the epistatic gene (i) 
so inhibition occurs only in recessive 
homozygosity (ii).
9. In the hybridization of 2 
genes (4 different alleles, 2 of 
each pair) how does epistasis 
affect the proportion of 
phenotypical forms in the F2 
generation?
In dihybridism without epistasis double 
heterozygous parental individuals cross 
and in F2 4 phenotypical forms appear. 
The proportion is 9 double dominant to 
3 dominant for the first pair, recessive 
for the second to 3 recessive for the 
first pair, dominant for the second to 1 
double recessive (9:3:3:1).
Considering that the epistatic gene is 
the second pair and that the recessive 
genotype of the hypostatic gene means 
lacking of the characteristic, in the F2 
generation of the dominant epistasis the 
following phenotypical forms would 
emerge: 13 dominant for the second 
pair or recessive for the first, i.e., the 
characteristic does not manifest, 3 
dominant for the first pair, recessive for 
the second, i.e., the characteristic 
manifests. The phenotypical proportion 
would be 13:3. In the recessive 
epistasis in F2 the phenotypical forms 
that would emerge are: 9 double 
dominant (the characteristic manifests), 
7 recessive for the first pair or recessive 
for the second, i.e., the characteristic 
does not manifest. So the phenotypical 
proportion would be 9:7.
These examples show how epistasis 
changes phenotypical forms and 
proportions, from the normal 9:3:3:1 in 
F2 to 13:3 in dominant epistasis or to 
9:7 in recessive epistasis (note that 
some forms have even disappeared).
(If the recessive genotype of the 
hypostatic gene is active, not simply 
meaning that the dominant allele does 
not manifest, the number of 
phenotypical forms in F2 changes.)

10. What is polygenic 
inheritance? How does it 
work?
Polygenic inheritance, also known as 
quantitative inheritance, is the gene 
interaction in which a given trait is 
conditioned by several different genes 
having alleles that may or may not 
contribute to increase the phenotype 
intensity. The alleles may be 
contributing or noncontributing and 
there is no dominance among them. 
Polygenic inheritance is the type of 
inheritance, for example, of skin color 
and of stature in humans.
Considering a given species of animal in 
which the length of the individual is 
conditioned by polygenic inheritance of 
three genes, for the genotype having 
only noncontributing alleles (aabbcc) a 
basal phenotype, for example, 30 cm, 
would emerge. Considering also that for 
each contributing allele a 5 cm increase 
in the length of the animal is added, so 
in the genotype having only contributing 
alleles (AABBCC) the animal would 
present the basal phenotype (30 cm) 
plus 30 cm more added by each 
contributing allele, i.e., its length would 
be 60 cm. In the case of triple 
heterozygosity, for example, the length 
of the animal would be 45 cm. That is 
the way polygenic inheritance works.
11. What is the most probable 
inheritance pattern of a trait 
with gaussian proportional 
distribution of phenotypical 
forms?
If a trait statistically has a normal 
(gaussian, bell-shaped curve) 
distribution of its phenotypical forms it 
is probable that it is conditioned by 
polygenic inheritance (quantitative 
inheritance).
In quantitative inheritance the effects of 
several genes add to others making it 
possible to represent the trait variation 
of a given population in a gaussian 
curve with the heterozygous genotypes 
in the center, i.e., appearing in larger 
number, and the homozygous in the 
extremities.
12. How to find the number of 
pair of alleles involved in 
polygenic inheritance using 
the number of phenotypical 
forms of the trait they 
condition?
Considering “p” the number of 
phenotypical forms and “a” the number 
of involved alleles of the polygenic 
inheritance. The formula p = 2a + 1 is 
then applied.
(Many times it is not possible to 
determine precisely the number of 
phenotypical forms, p, due to the 
multigenic feature of the inheritance, 
since often the observed variation of 
phenotypes seems to be on a continuum 
or the trait suffers environmental 
influence.)

Biology Questions and Answers
13. Why is sex-linked 
inheritance an example of 
nonmendelian inheritance?
Sex-linked inheritance is a type of 
nonmendelian inheritance because it 
opposes Mendel’s first law, which 
postulates that each trait is always 
conditioned by two factors (alleles). In 
nonhomologous regions of the sex 
chromosomes the genotypes of the 
genes contain only one allele (even in 
the case of the XX karyotype, i.e., in 
women, one of the X chromosomes is 
inactive).
14. What is mitochondrial 
inheritance?
Mitochondrial inheritance is the passage 
of mitochondrial DNA molecules 
(mtDNA) to the offspring. All stock of 
mtDNA an individual has have come 
from the mother, the maternal 
grandmother, the maternal great 
grandmother and so on, since 
mitochondria are inherited from the 
cytoplasm of the egg cell (that later 
constitutes the cytoplasm of the 
zygote).
There are several genetic diseases 
caused by mitochondrial inheritance, 
like Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, 
that leads to loss of the central vision of 
both eyes, and the Kearns-Sayre 
syndrome, a neuromuscular disease 
that causes ophthalmoplegia and muscle 
fatigue.
Mitochondrial inheritance is an excellent 
means of genetic analysis of the 
maternal lineage (just like the Y 
chromosome is an excellent means of 
study of the paternal lineage).

Biology Questions and Answers
Linkage and 
Crossing Over
1. Why is not Mendel’s second 
law always valid for two or 
more phenotypical traits of an 
individual?
Mendel’s second law, or the law of the 
independent assortment, is valid for 
genes located in different chromosomes. 
These genes during meiosis segregate 
independently.
Mendel’s second law however is not 
valid for phenotypical features 
conditioned by genes located in the 
same chromosome (genes under 
linkage), since these genes, known as 
linked genes, do not separate in meiosis 
(except for the phenomenon of crossing 
over).
2. Why is drosophila a 
convenient animal for the 
study of linked genes?
The fruit fly drosophila is suitable for the 
study of Genetics because it presents 
many distinct traits but only four 
chromosomes (one sex chromosome 
and three autosomes).
3. What is linkage?
Two genes are said to be under linkage, 
or linked, when they reside in the same 
chromosome.
For example, the research of the human 
genome discovered that the factor III of 
clotting gene and the factor V of clotting 
gene are located in the same 
chromosome (the human chromosome 
1). The factor VII gene however is not 
linked to those genes since it is located 
in the chromosome 13.
4. What is crossing over? How 
is meiosis related to this 
phenomenon?
Linked alleles, for example, A-b and a-
B, form the gametes A-b and a-B that 
maintain the linkage of the alleles. This 
type of linkage is called complete 
linkage. In the first division of meiosis 
(meiosis I) however the crossing over 
phenomenon may occur. Chromosomes 
from a pair of homologous may 
exchange extremities and some once 
linked alleles, for example, A-b and a-B, 
recombine to form different gametes, in 
the case, A-B and a-b.
Crossing over may happen when the 
arms of the chromatids of each 
homologous are paired during meiosis. 
Matching portions of the extremities of 
two nonsister chromatids (one from one 
homologous of the pair) break and the 
pieces are exchanged, each of them 
becoming part of the arm of the other 
chromatid. For example, if the allele A is 
situated in a side of the arm relating to 
the point of breaking and the allele b is

Biology Questions and Answers
located in the other side, they will be 
separated and gametes A-B and a-b will 
be formed, instead of A-b and a-B.
(The percentage of recombinant 
gametes relating to normal gametes 
depends upon the crossing over rate 
that in its turn depends upon how far 
distant the given alleles are in the 
chromosome.)
5. In genetic recombination by 
crossing over what is the 
difference between parental 
gametes and recombinant 
gametes?
Parental gametes are those gametes 
that maintain the original linkage of 
genes (alleles) in the chromosome. 
Recombinant gametes are those in 
which the original linkage is undone due 
to exchange of chromosomal pieces by 
crossing over during meiosis.
6. What is recombination 
frequency?
Recombination frequency, or crossing 
over rate, is the percentage of 
recombinant gametes made by crossing 
over (in relation to the number of 
parental gametes made). It always 
refers to two genes located in the same 
chromosome.
7. Why does the 
recombination frequency of 
genes vary with the distance 
between them in the 
chromosome?
The farther the distance between the 
loci of two genes in a chromosome the 
higher the recombination frequency 
between these genes. This is true 
because once alleles are nearer in the 
chromosome it is more probable that 
they are kept united when chromosomal 
extremities are exchanged by crossing 
over. On the other hand, if they are 
farther apart it will be easier for them to 
separate by crossing over.
8. What is a centimorgan?
Centimorgan, or recombination unit, by 
convention is a distance between two 
linked genes that corresponds to 1% of 
recombination frequency of these 
genes.
9. How can the concept of 
recombination frequency be 
used in genetic mapping?
Genetic mapping is the determination of 
the location of the genes in a 
chromosome.
By determining the recombination 
frequency between several different 
linked genes it is possible to estimate 
the distance between them in the 
chromosome. For example, if a gene A 
has a recombination frequency of 20% 
with the gene B, this gene B has

Biology Questions and Answers
recombination frequency of 5% with the 
gene C and this gene C has 
recombination frequency of 15% with 
the gene A, it is possible to assert that 
the gene A is 20 centimorgans distant 
from the gene B and that between them 
lies the gene C at 15 centimorgans of 
distance from the gene A.
10. Is crossing over important 
for the diversity of biological 
evolution?
Sexual reproduction and recombination 
of linked genes (crossing over) are, 
along with mutations, the main 
instruments of biological variability. 
Sexual reproduction allows many 
combinations between genes situated in 
different chromosomes. Crossing over, 
however, is the only means to provide 
recombination of alleles located in a 
same chromosome. Crossing over 
probably emerged and has been 
maintained by the evolution because of 
its importance to biological diversity.

Biology Questions and Answers
Sex Determination 
and Sex-Linked 
Inheritance
1. How is the genetic 
determination of sex 
established in humans?
In the diploid genome of human beings 
there are 46 chromosomes, 44 of them 
are autosomes and two are sex 
chromosomes. The individual inherits 
one of these chromosomes from each 
parent.
The human sex chromosomes are called 
X chromosome and Y chromosome. 
Individuals having two X chromosomes 
(44 + XX) are female. Individuals 
having one X chromosome and one Y 
chromosome (44 + XY) are male. 
(Individuals 44 + YY do not exist since 
the chromosome Y is exclusively from 
paternal lineage.)
2. What are the homologous 
and the heterologous portions 
of the human sex 
chromosomes?
Homologous portion is that in which 
there are genes having alleles in both Y 
and X sex chromosomes. The 
homologous portions are situated more 
in the central part of the sex 
chromosomes, near the centromere.
Heterologous portion is that whose 
genes do not have correspondent alleles 
in the other sex chromosome. These 
genes are located more in the peripheral 
regions of the arms of the Y and X 
chromosomes.
3. Concerning the sex 
chromosomes of the XY 
system which type of gamete 
do the male and the female 
individuals respectively 
produce?
The individual of the male sex is XY so 
he forms gametes containing either the 
X chromosome or the Y chromosome in 
a 1:1 proportion. The individual of the 
female sex is XX and thus she forms 
only gametes containing an X 
chromosome.
4. Is it possible that an X 
chromosome of a woman can 
have come from her father?
It is not only possible that an X 
chromosome of a woman is from her 
father, it is certain. Every woman has 
an X chromosome from her father and 
the other X chromosome from her 
mother.
In men however the X chromosome 
comes always from his mother and the 
Y chromosome is always from his 
father.

Biology Questions and Answers
5. Is it more indicated for a 
geneticist desiring to map the 
X chromosome of the mother 
of a given family (the 
researcher does not have 
access to her DNA, only access 
to the genetic material of the 
offspring) to analyze the 
chromosomes of her 
daughters or of her sons?
To analyze the X DNA of a mother 
(assuming no access to her own 
material) it is more indicated to study 
the genetic material of her sons since all 
X chromosomes of males come from the 
mother while the daughters have X 
chromosomes from the mother and 
from the father. By researching the 
material of the sons it is ensured that 
the studied X chromosome is from the 
mother.
6. Do the genes of the X and Y 
chromosomes determine only 
sex characteristics?
Besides sex genes the sex 
chromosomes have also autosomal 
genes, genes that codify several 
proteins related to nonsexual traits.
7. What are the main diseases 
caused by errors of the 
number of sex chromosomes 
in the cells of an individual?
Diseases caused by abnormal number of 
sex chromosomes are called sex 
aneuploidies.
The main sex aneuploidies are: 44 + 
XXX, or trisomy X (women whose cells 
have an additional X chromosome); 44 
+ XXY, or Klinefelter's syndrome (men 
whose cells have an extra X 
chromosome); 44 + XYY, or double Y 
syndrome (men whose cells have an 
additional Y chromosome); 44 + X, 
Turner’s syndrome (women whose cells 
lack an X chromosome).
8. What is the inactivation of 
the X chromosome? What is a 
Barr body?
Inactivation of the X chromosome is a 
phenomenon that occurs in women. 
Since women have two X chromosomes 
only one of them remains active and 
functional mixed to the chromatin while 
the other remains condensed and 
inactive.
In the same woman in some cell 
lineages the functional X chromosome is 
the one from the father and in other cell 
lineages the functional chromosome is 
the X from the mother characterizing a 
condition known as mosaicism (related 
to the X chromosome).
Under the microscope the inactive X 
chromosome is seen as a granule 
generally in the periphery of the 
nucleus. This granule is called the Barr 
body.

Biology Questions and Answers
9. Besides the XY system are 
there other sex determination 
systems?
Some animals have a sex determination 
system different from the XY system.
The X0 system is the sex determination 
system of many insects; in this system 
the females are XX and the males have 
only one X chromosome (a conditioned 
represented by X0).
In birds, in some fishes and in 
lepidopterae (butterflies) insects the sex 
determination is made by the ZW 
system; in this system females are ZW 
and males are ZZ.
In another system, the haploid-diploid 
sex determination system, one of the 
sexes is represented by the fertilized 
diploid individual and the individual of 
the opposite sex is formed by 
parthenogenesis, being haploid (it 
occurs in bees and other insects).
10. What are X-linked traits?
X-linked traits are phenotypical traits 
conditioned by genes located in the 
nonhomologous (heterologous) portions 
of the X chromosome.
11. How many alleles of genes 
that condition X-linked traits 
do female and male 
individuals respectively 
present?
For each correspondent gene to an X-
linked trait women present always two 
alleles since they have two X 
chromosomes. Men present only one 
allele of genes related to X-linked traits 
since they have one X chromosome.
12. What is the clinical 
deficiency presented by 
hemophilic people? What is 
the genetic cause of that 
deficiency?
Hemophilia is a disease characterized by 
impaired blood clotting and the affected 
person is more prone to internal and 
external hemorrhages.
Patients with hemophilia A have 
alteration in the gene that codifies the 
factor VIII of blood clotting, a gene 
located in the non-homologous portion 
of the X chromosome. Patients with 
hemophilia B present a defect of the 
gene that codifies the factor IX of 
clotting, a gene also located in the non-
homologous region of the X 
chromosome. Thus both diseases are X-
linked diseases.
13. What are all possibilities 
of genotypes and phenotypes 
formed in the combination of 
alleles responsible for the 
production of factor VIII?
Considering the alleles Xh and X, where 
Xh represents the allele that conditions 
hemophilia A, in women the possible 
genotypes are XX, XXh and XhXh. In 
men the possible genotypes are XY and

Biology Questions and Answers
XhY. Concerning the phenotypes, factor 
VIII is produced in every individual with 
at least one nonaffected X chromosome. 
So the women XX and X Xh and the 
men XY are normal. Only women XhXh 
and men XhY have the disease.
14. Why is it rare to find 
hemophilic women?
There are more hemophilic men than 
hemophilic women because women 
need to have two X chromosomes 
affected to develop the disease while in 
men the disease manifests when the 
single X chromosome is affected.
15. Is it possible for any son 
of a couple formed by a 
hemophilic man (XhY) and a 
nonhemophilic noncarrier 
(XX) woman to be hemophilic?
If mothers are not affected by the 
disease and noncarriers of the gene (do 
not have an Xh allele) it is impossible 
for their sons to be hemophilic since the 
X chromosome of males always comes 
from the mother. Hemophilic sons are 
only possible when the mother is 
hemophilic (homozygous for the 
hemophilic gene, a very rare situation) 
or carriers of an affected X chromosome 
(XXh).
16. What is the clinical 
manifestation of the disease 
known as daltonism?
The X-linked daltonism is a disease in 
which the affected individual sees the 
red color as green or confounds these 
two colours.
17. What is the type of genetic 
inheritance of daltonism? Is 
daltonism more frequent in 
men or in women? What is the 
physiological explanation for 
the daltonism?
Daltonism is a recessive X-linked 
inheritance (gene situated in the 
nonhomologous portion of the X 
chromosome).
Daltonism is more frequent in men since 
in them only the single X chromosome 
needs to be affected for the disease to 
manifest. In women it is necessary for 
both X chromosomes to be affected for 
the disease to come out.
The disease appears due to a defect in 
the gene that codifies a retinal pigment 
sensitive to red.
18. Are sex-linked diseases 
associated only to genes of 
the X chromosome?
There are many X-linked diseases, like 
hemophilia A, hemophilia B and 
adrenoleukodystrophy, but known Y-
linked diseases are few and very rare.

19. What are holandric genes?
Holandric genes are genes situated in 
the nonhomologous region of the Y 
chromosome. Holandric genes condition 
phenotypes that emerge only in men 
since individuals of the female sex do 
not present in their X chromosomes 
genes from the nonhomologous portion 
of the Y chromosome (existent only in 
men). A widely known holandric gene is 
the one that conditions hypertrichosis 
pinnae (hair in the ears), a phenotype 
inherited from fathers to sons through 
the Y chromosome.
20. What is sex-influenced 
dominance?
Sex-influenced dominance is the 
phenomenon in which the manifestation 
of a phenotype of a gene in 
heterozygosity depends on the sex of 
the individual. For example, hereditary 
baldness is a dominant phenotypical 
form if the individual is male and it is a 
recessive form if the individual is 
female.

Biology Questions and Answers
Blood Types
1. What are the main human 
blood group systems?
In humans the main blood group 
systems are the ABO system, the Rh 
system and the MN system.
2. Why is the determination of 
the blood types of the donor 
and of the recipient important 
in transfusions?
Red blood cells have different antigens 
in the outer surface of their plasma 
membrane; for example, the antigens A 
and B of the ABO system are 
glycoproteins of the membrane. If a 
donor has red blood cells with antigens 
not present in the red blood cells of the 
recipient (lacking of transfusion 
compatibility) the immune system of the 
recipient recognizes these molecules as 
actual antigens (i.e., foreign 
substances) and triggers a defense 
response producing specific antibodies 
against those antigens. The transfused 
red blood cells then are destroyed by 
these antibodies and the recipient 
individual may even die.
3. What are the antigens and 
the respective antibodies of 
the ABO blood group system?
The ABO blood system includes the 
erythrocytic antigens A and B that can 
be attacked by the antibodies anti-A and 
anti-B.
The antigens A and B are agglutinogens 
and the antibodies anti-A and anti-B are 
agglutinins.
4. What are the blood types of 
the ABO blood system?
The blood types of the ABO blood 
system are the type A, the type B, the 
type AB and the type O.
5. What are the antigens and 
antibodies of each blood type 
of the ABO blood system?
Type A: antigen A, antibody anti-B. 
Type B: antigen B, antibody anti-A. 
Type AB: antigens A and B, does not 
produce antibody A neither antibody B. 
Type O: does not have antigen A neither 
antigen B, has antibodies anti-A and 
anti-B.
(Obviously antibodies are made by B 
lymphocytes not by red blood cells.)
6. What is the logic of the 
transfusional compatibility 
concerning the ABO blood 
group system?
The transfusional compatibility for the 
ABO system takes into account the 
www.biology-questions-and-answers.com

Biology Questions and Answers
antigens present in the red blood cells 
of the donor and the antibodies that the 
recipient can produce. Whenever the 
recipient is not able to produce 
antibodies against antigens of the red 
blood cells of the donor the transfusion 
is compatible.
So regarding ABO compatibility type A 
can donate to type A and to type AB. 
Type B can donate to type B and to type 
AB. Type AB can donate only to type 
AB. Type O can donate to all ABO types.
(Blood transfusion must be studied, 
planned and supervised by doctors.)
7. What are universal donors 
and universal recipients 
concerning the ABO blood 
system?
Universals donors of the ABO blood type 
system are the individuals of the type 
O. Type O blood does not have antigen 
A neither antigen B in its red blood cells 
and can be donated to individuals of any 
ABO type.
Universal recipients of the ABO blood 
type system are the individuals of the 
type AB. Type AB blood does not 
contain antibody anti-A neither antibody 
anti-B and people of this group can 
receive blood from any of the ABO 
types.
8. What is the type of genetic 
inheritance that determines 
the ABO blood group system? 
What are the relations of 
dominance among the 
involved alleles?
The inheritance of the ABO blood 
system is a multiple alleles inheritance. 
There are three involved alleles, IA, IB 
and i that combine in pairs to form the 
genotypes.
Concerning dominance, the allele i is 
recessive in relation to the alleles IA and 
IB. Between IA and IB however lack of 
dominance is established with the 
heterozygous (IAIB) manifesting distinct 
phenotype.
9. What are the genotypes and 
respective blood types of the 
ABO system?
Since the alleles are IA, IB and i the 
possible genotypes are IAIA (blood type 
A), IAIB (blood type AB), IBIB (blood type 
B) and ii (blood type O).
10. Is it possible to perform 
investigation of natural 
paternity, maternity or 
brotherhood and sisterhood 
using the ABO blood typing?
By using the ABO blood typing it is 
possible only to exclude paternity, 
maternity or brotherhood/sisterhood but 
it is not possible to conclude positively 
about these relationships.

Biology Questions and Answers
For example, if an individual has type O 
blood, ii genotype, he or she cannot 
have biological parents of the type AB 
(IAIB genotype) since necessarily one of 
his/her alleles has come from the father 
and the other from the mother. Another 
example: a couple of individuals of the 
type O (ii) in their turn can only 
generate direct offspring of the type O 
blood, since they do not have alleles 
that condition antigen A neither antigen 
B.
11. Is ABO blood compatibility 
enough for the safety of blood 
transfusion?
Besides ABO blood compatibility the 
compatibility concerning the Rh blood 
system must also be checked. In 
addition it is of fundamental importance 
for the safety of blood transfusion 
performing tests to detect agents of 
main blood transmitted infectious 
diseases, like HIV (AIDS), hepatitis B 
and C, syphilis, Chagas disease, etc.
(Any transfusion must be studied, 
planned and supervised by doctors.)
12. What is the Rh factor?
RH factor is a protein of the red blood 
cell plasma membrane that behaves as 
antigen in blood transfusions triggering 
a humoral (antibody-based) immune 
response. Most people present the 
protein in their red blood cells and are 
part of the Rh+ group. People that do 
not have the protein classify as Rh-.
The origin of the name Rh factor is 
related to the first researches that 
discovered this blood antigen was in 
rhesus monkeys (“Macaca mulatta”).
13. How are the antibodies 
against the Rh factor formed?
Anti-Rh antibodies are made by humoral 
immune response. When an Rh- 
individual makes contact with the Rh 
factor this is recognized as foreign 
(antigen), the primary immune 
response begins and small amounts of 
anti-Rh antibodies and memory B 
lymphocytes are made. In future 
contact with the antigen there will 
already be circulating antibodies and 
memory immune cells prepared to 
create an intense and effective attack 
against the Rh factor.
14. What is blood typing?
Blood typing is the determination, by 
means of tests, of the classification of a 
blood sample concerning blood group 
systems (specially the ABO system and 
the Rh system).
15. How is the blood typing 
concerning the ABO system 
and the Rh usually done?
In the blood typing for the ABO system 
and the Rh system a blood sample is 
collected from the person and three 
small volumes of the sample are 
separated and dispersed on glass 
laminae (slides). On the first lamina

serum containing anti-A antibody is 
dripped; on the second lamina serum 
containing anti-B antibody is dripped; 
on the third lamina serum with anti-RH 
antibody is dripped. If no agglutination 
reaction takes place in all of the laminae 
the blood is of type O- (universal 
donor); if agglutination occurs only in 
the first lamina the blood is type A-; 
and so on.
There are other methods of blood 
typing. Blood typing must be performed 
by qualified technicians.
16. What are the inheritance 
and dominance patterns of the 
Rh blood system?
The inheritance pattern of the Rh blood 
system is autosomal dominant, i.e., the 
heterozygous manifests as Rh+. The 
dominance is complete (R is dominant 
over r). The possible genotypes are RR, 
Rr (both Rh+) and rr (Rh-).
Curiosity: the Rh factor is codified by a 
gene containing 2790 DNA nucleotides 
situated in the human chromosome 1.
17. What is the logic of the 
transfusional compatibility 
concerning the Rh blood group 
system?
An Rh+ donor can only donate blood to 
an Rh+ recipient. A person that lacks 
the Rh factor (Rh-) can donate to 
individuals of the Rh+ and Rh- groups.
18. What is the Rh typing of 
the mother and of the fetus in 
the hemolytic disease of the 
newborn?
In the hemolytic disease of the newborn 
the mother is Rh- and the fetus Rh+. In 
this disease antibodies produced by the 
mother attack the fetal red blood cells.
The hemolytic disease of the new born 
is also known as erythroblastosis fetalis.
19. How does the immune 
process that causes the 
hemolytic disease of the 
newborn take place?
In the hemolytic disease of the newborn 
the mother has Rh- blood. This mother 
when generating her first Rh+ child 
makes contact, possibly during delivery, 
with Rh+ red blood cells of the child and 
her immune system triggers the primary 
immune response against the Rh factor. 
In the next gestation in which the fetus 
is Rh+ the mother will already have 
much more anti-Rh antibodies in her 
circulation; these antibodies cross the 
placental barrier and gain the fetal 
circulation causing fetal hemolysis 
(destruction of the red blood cells of the 
fetus).
20. How can the hemolytic 
disease of the newborn be 
prevented?
Erythroblastosis fetalis can be prevented 
if in the first delivery of a Rh+ child 
from a Rh- mother serum containing

anti-Rh antibodies is given to the 
mother in the first 72 hours (after the 
delivery). Therefore the administered 
anti-Rh antibodies destroy the fetal red 
blood cells that entered the mother’s 
circulation before the triggering of her 
primary immune response.
21. What is the MN blood 
system? What is the pattern of 
genetic inheritance of the MN 
blood system?
The MN blood system is a third (in 
addition to the ABO and the Rh) system 
of blood antigens also related to 
proteins of the red blood cell plasma 
membrane.
The inheritance pattern of the MN blood 
system is autosomal with codominance, 
a type of lack of dominance in which the 
heterozygous manifests a phenotype 
totally distinct from the homozygous. 
The possible phenotypical forms are 
three blood types: type M blood, type N 
blood and type MN blood.

Biology Questions and Answers
Karyotype and 
Genetic Diseases
1. What is karyotype?
The name karyotype is given to the set 
of chromosomes of an individual, 
usually when visualized and identified 
under the microscope. The visualization 
generally is made with the cells in the 
initial phases of cell division for the 
chromosomes to be seen already 
replicated and condensed.
2. Which type of genetic 
disease can be identified from 
the visual analysis of the 
number of chromosomes 
present in a karyotype?
The counting and identification of 
chromosomes in the karyotype of an 
individual can diagnose the 
aneuploidies, diseases caused by 
alteration in the number of 
chromosomes in relation to the normal 
number of the species.
3. Why in the preparation of a 
karyotype analysis is the use 
of a substance like colchicine 
interesting?
Colchicine is a substance that disallows 
the formation of microtubules and thus 
of the spindle fibers in cell division. 
Under the action of this drug the cells 
interrupt division at metaphase and the 
anaphase does not occur. Therefore the 
use of colchicine in the study of 
karyotypes is interesting because 
chromosomes will be seen replicated 
and condensed.
4. What is the karyotype 
found in Down syndrome?
Down syndrome is an aneuploidy, i.e., a 
numeric alteration of chromosomes 
within the cells compared to the normal 
number of chromosomes of the species. 
Affected individuals have in their cells 
an additional chromosome 21 instead of 
only one pair. For this reason the 
condition is also called trisomy 21. The 
affected person has karyotype with 47 
chromosomes: 45 + XY or 45 + XX.
5. What is aneuploidy? What 
are the conditions caused by 
the aneuploidies?
Aneuploidy is an abnormal number of 
chromosomes in the cells of an 
individual.
The main aneuploidies of the human 
species and their respective conditions 
are: the nullisomies (absence of any 
chromosome pair of the species, often 
incompatible with life); the monosomies 
(absence of a chromosome from a pair, 
for example, Turner’s syndrome, 44 + 
X); the trisomies (an extra 
chromosome, for example, the triple X 
syndrome, 44 + XXX, or the Edwards

Biology Questions and Answers
syndrome, trisomy 18, 45 + XY or 45 + 
XX).
6. In general what is the 
cause of the aneuploidies?
Generally the aneuploidies are caused 
by impaired assortment of 
chromosomes during meiosis. For 
example, when the homologous 
chromosomes of the pair 21 do not 
separate gametes with two 
chromosomes 21 and gametes without 
chromosomes 21 form. If a gamete with 
two chromosomes 21 fecundates a 
normal gamete of the opposite sex the 
zygote will present trisomy (three 
chromosomes 21). If a gamete without 
chromosomes 21 fecundates a normal 
gamete of the opposite sex there will be 
a zygote with monosomy (with only one 
chromosome 21).
The defects in the separation of 
chromosomes during cell division are 
called chromosomal nondisjunctions. 
During meiosis nondisjunctions may 
occur in the anaphase I (nondisjunction 
of homologous) as well in anaphase II 
(nondisjunction of sister chromatids).
7. Do all genetic diseases 
result from alteration in the 
number of chromosomes of 
the cells?
Besides aneuploidies there are other 
genetic diseases, other chromosomal 
abnormalities and also the genetic 
mutations.
8. How are genetic diseases 
classified?
Genetic diseases classify into 
chromosomal abnormalities and genetic 
mutations.
Among chromosomal abnormalities 
there are the aneuploidies, diseases 
caused by alterations of the normal 
(euploidy) number of chromosomes of 
the species. An example of aneuploidy is 
Down syndrome, or trisomy 21, in which 
there are three chromosomes 21 
instead of the normal pair. In the group 
of chromosomal abnormalities there are 
also the deletions (absence of part of a 
chromosome), the inversions (in which 
a chromosome breaks and its pieces 
reconnect in inverse manner) and the 
translocations (pieces of a chromosome 
that exchange positions).
In the genetic mutation group there are 
the deletions (one or more DNA 
nucleotide absent), the substitutions 
and the insertions.
9. What are genetic 
mutations?
Genetic mutations are alterations of the 
genetic material (compared to the 
normal condition of the species) 
involving modifications in the normal 
nucleotide sequence of a gene but 
without structural or numeric 
chromosomal changes.
These modifications may be deletions 
(loss of nucleotides), substitutions 
(exchange of nucleotides by other 
different nucleotides) or insertions

Biology Questions and Answers
(placement of additional nucleotides in 
the DNA molecule).
10. Does every gene mutation 
cause alteration in the protein 
the gene normally codifies?
Not every gene mutation causes 
alteration in the composition of the 
protein the gene codifies. Since the 
genetic code is degenerated, i.e., there 
are amino acids codified by more than 
one different DNA nucleotide triplet, if 
by chance the mutation substitutes one 
or more nucleotides of a codifier triplet 
and the newly formed triplet still 
codifies the same amino acid codified by 
the original triplet there will be no 
modification in the protein made from 
the gene.
11. How do genetic mutations 
influence biological diversity?
Too extensive or too frequent genetic 
mutations generally are deleterious for 
individuals and species. These 
mutations often cause important 
phenotypical changes or defects 
incompatible with the survival of the 
body and the continuity of the species.
However small genetic mutations that 
do not cause the appearing of lethal 
changes are continuously accumulated 
in the genetic patrimony of the species. 
These mutations gradually add to each 
other giving birth to small phenotypical 
changes in individuals. These small 
changes are exposed to the selective 
criticism of the environment (natural 
selection) and the more favorable for 
survival and reproduction are preserved 
(the remaider are eliminated as their 
carriers have difficulty in surviving and 
reproducing). In this manner the 
combined processes of accumulation of 
small mutations and of natural selection 
incorporate new features in the species 
and they may even lead to speciation 
(formation of new species) and 
promotion of biological diversity.
(Obviously only genetic mutations 
transmitted by cells that originate new 
individuals, in sexual or asexual 
reproduction, have evolutionary effect.)
12. What are mutagenic 
agents?
Mutagenic agents, or mutagens, are 
physical, chemical or biological factors 
that can cause alteration in DNA 
molecules.
Examples of well-known or believed to 
be mutagenic agents are: X, alpha, beta 
and gamma rays, ultraviolet radiation, 
nitrous acid, many dyes, some 
sweeteners, some herbicides, many 
substances of tobacco, some viruses, 
like HPV, etc. Small DNA fragments 
known as transposons can also act as 
mutagens when incorporated into other 
DNA molecules.

Biology Questions and Answers
13. How are mutagenic agents 
related to cancer incidence in 
a population? Is cancer a 
disease transmitted to the 
individual offspring?
The exposition of a population to 
mutagenic agents (for example, the 
people living in the surrounds of the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant and 
exposed to the radiation from the 
nuclear accident in 1986) increases the 
cancer incidence in that population. This 
occurs because the mutagenic agents 
increase the rate of mutation and the 
probability of mutant cells to proliferate 
in pathological manner (cancer).
Cancer itself is not a hereditarily 
transmissible disease. Genetic 
predispositions for the development of 
cancer, however, can be inherited.
14. How do the repairing 
enzymes of the genetic 
system act?
There are enzymes within the cells that 
detect errors or alterations in DNA 
molecules and begin a repair of those 
errors. First, enzymes known as 
restriction endonucleases, specialized in 
cutting DNA molecules (also used in 
genetic engineering), cut the affected 
piece of DNA. Then polymerase 
enzymes build correct sequences of 
nucleotides correspondent to the 
affected piece taking as template the 
DNA chain complementary to the 
affected chain. Finally the new correct 
sequence is bound in the DNA under 
repair by specific enzymes.
15. What are some diseases or 
genetic abnormalities caused 
by recessive genes?
Examples of recessive genetic diseases 
are: cystic fibrosis, albinism, 
phenylketonuria, galactosemia, Tay-
Sachs disease.
16. What are some diseases or 
genetic abnormalities caused 
by dominant genes? Why are 
severe dominant genetic 
diseases rarer than recessive 
ones?
Examples of dominant genetic diseases 
are: Huntington's disease (or 
Huntington’s chorea), 
neurofibromatosis, 
hypercholesterolemia, polycystic kidney 
disease.
Severe and early autosomal dominant 
diseases are rarer than recessive 
autosomal diseases because in this last 
group the affected allele may be hidden 
in the heterozygous individuals and 
transmitted to the offspring until 
undergoing homozygosity (actual 
manifestation of the disease). In severe 
dominant diseases the heterozygous 
manifests the condition and often dies 
without having offspring. (Some genetic 
diseases are of later manifestation, like 
Huntington disease; in these cases the 
incidence is higher because many 
individuals have children before knowing 
that they are carriers of the dominant 
gene).

17. What is consanguineal 
marriage? Why is the 
appearing of genetic disease 
more probable in the offspring 
of a consanguineal marriage?
Consanguineal marriage is the marriage 
between relatives, i.e., people having 
common near ancestors.
The consanguineal marriage increases 
the probability of recessive genetic 
disease in the offspring since it is 
common for people from the same 
genetic lineage to be heterozygous 
carriers of alleles that condition 
recessive genetic diseases.
18. How is the early diagnosis 
of genetic diseases usually 
done?
Genetic disease may be diagnosed in 
the prenatal period by karyotype 
analysis, in case of aneuploidies, or by 
DNA analysis, in case of other diseases.
The test is performed by removal of 
material containing cells of the embryo 
by amniocentesis (extraction of amniotic 
fluid) or cordocentesis (puncture of the 
umbilical cord) or even by chorionic 
villus biopsy (that can be done earlier in 
gestation).
Ultrasonography is a diagnostic 
procedure for some genetic diseases 
that produce morphological variations 
during the embryonic development. The 
study of genetic family trees is also an 
important auxiliary method in the early 
diagnosis of many genetic diseases.
The Hardy-
Weinberg Principle
1. What is allele frequency?
Allele frequency is the percentage of 
appearances of an allele in the 
genotypes of a given population 
(compared to the other alleles of the 
studied gene).
For example, in the ABO blood system 
there are three alleles (IA, IB and i). 
Considering a group of three persons, 
one with genotype IAi, other IAIB and 
other ii, the frequency of the allele IA in 
this “population” is 2/6, the frequency 
of the allele IB is 1/6 and the frequency 
of the allele i is 3/6.
2. What is genetic 
equilibrium?
Genetic equilibrium is the result of the 
Hardy-Weinberg law, a principle that 
affirms that under specific conditions 
the frequencies of the alleles of a gene 
in a given population remain constant.
(The Hardy-Weinberg principle is not 
valid in the following conditions: for 
populations too small, in the occurrence 
of noncasual (driven) crossings, for 
populations with many infertile 
members and in case of action of 
evolutionary factors, like natural 
selection, mutations and migrations.)

Biology Questions and Answers
3. What is the mathematical 
expression of the genetic 
equilibrium for genes with two 
alleles? Is this statistical 
distribution the same as the 
statistical distribution of the 
respective phenotypes?
Considering p the frequency of one of 
the alleles and q the frequency of the 
other allele of a given gene in a 
population, in this population individuals 
produce p gametes with the first allele 
for each q gamete containing the 
second allele. Therefore the probabilities 
of formation of homozygous genotype 
for the first allele is p2, of homozygous 
genotype for the second allele is q2 and 
of the heterozygous genotype is p.q + 
q.p, i.e., 2p.q.
Since the sum of those probabilities 
necessarily is 1, the resulting 
mathematical expression is: p2 + 2p.q + 
q2 = 1.
In general the number of genotypical 
forms is not identical to the number of 
phenotypical forms since there are 
dominance and other interactions 
between genes that affect the 
manifestation of the phenotype.
4. An hypothesis for the 
extinction of the dinosaurs is 
that the earth had been hit by 
a gigantic meteor that caused 
the death of those big reptiles. 
In that case the entire genetic 
pool of those animals has 
been destroyed, invalidating 
the Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium. In Genetics what 
is this type of gene frequency 
change called?
The phenomenon in which a large 
number of genes is destroyed or 
introduced in a population is called 
genetic drift.
When a genetic drift occurs the Hardy 
Weinberg principle is not applicable.
5. What are the penetrance 
and the expressivity of a 
gene?
Individuals that carry a same genotype 
do not always manifest in an identical 
manner the correspondent phenotype. 
These manifestations may differ in 
intensity, from one individual to 
another, or even the phenotype may not 
manifest in some percentage of carriers.
Gene penetrance is the percentage of 
phenotypical manifestation of a gene in 
a given population of carrier individuals 
(same genotype). Gene expressivity is 
the degree (intensity) of the 
phenotypical manifestation of a gene in 
each individual or group of individuals 
that carry the gene (same genotype).

expressiveness may be influenced by 
the environment.
6. Why is a balanced 
frequency of different alleles 
of a gene in a population more 
useful for the survival of that 
population facing 
environmental changes?
For a trait conditioned by two alleles, for 
example, A and a, a balanced frequency 
between the alleles A and b is more 
advantageous for survival. For example, 
in an environmental situation in which 
the aa homozygous phenotype becomes 
incompatible with life the presence of a 
good number of individuals AA and Aa 
will result in better survival chance for 
the species. Another example: an 
environmental situation in which the 
dominant phenotype becomes 
incompatible with life; in this case the 
existence of heterozygous and recessive 
homozygous individuals in enough 
number may be fundamental for the 
survival of the species.

Genetic 
Engineering
1. What is biotechnology?
Biotechnology is the application of 
biological knowledge to obtain new 
techniques, materials and compounds of 
pharmaceutical, medical, agrarian, 
industrial and scientific use, i.e., of 
practical use.
The pioneer fields of biotechnology were 
agriculture and the food industry but 
nowadays many other practical fields 
use its techniques.
2. What is genetic 
engineering?
Genetic engineering is the use of 
genetic knowledge to artificially 
manipulate genes: It is one of the fields 
of biotechnology.
3. At the present level of the 
biotechnology what are the 
main techniques of genetic 
engineering?
The main techniques of genetic 
engineering today are: the recombinant 
DNA technology (also called genetic 
engineering itself) in which pieces of 
genes from an organism are inserted 
into the genetic material of another 
organism producing recombinant 
beings; the nucleus transplantation 
technology, popularly known as 
“cloning”, in which a nucleus of a cell is 
grafted into a enucleated egg cell of the 
same species to create a genetic copy of 
the donor (of the nucleus) individual; 
the technology of DNA amplification, or 
PCR (polymerase chain reaction), that 
allows millions replications of chosen 
fragments of a DNA molecule.
The recombinant DNA technology is 
used to create transgenic organisms, 
like mutant insulin-producing bacteria. 
The nucleus transplantation technology 
is in its initial development but it is the 
basis, for example, of the creation of 
“Dolly” the sheep. PCR has numerous 
practical uses, as in medical tests to 
detect microorganisms present in blood 
and tissues, DNA fingerprint and 
obtainment of DNA samples for 
research.
4. What are restriction 
enzymes? How do these 
enzymes participate in the 
recombinant DNA technology?
Restriction enzymes, or restriction 
endonucleases, are enzymes specialized 
in the cutting of DNA fragments each 
acting upon specific sites of the DNA 
molecule. Restriction enzymes are used 
in the recombinant DNA technology to 
obtain with precision pieces of DNA 
molecules to be later inserted into other 
DNA molecules cut by the same 
enzymes.

5. What are DNA ligases? How 
do these enzymes participate 
in the recombinant DNA 
technology?
DNA ligases are enzymes specialized in 
tying the complementary DNA chains 
that form the DNA double helix. These 
enzymes are used in the recombinant 
DNA technology to insert pieces of DNA 
cut by restriction enzymes into other 
DNA molecules submitted to the action 
of the same endonucleases.
6. What are plasmids?
Plasmids are circular DNA molecules 
present in the genetic material of some 
bacteria. They may contain genes 
responsible for bacterial resistance to 
some antibiotics and for proteins that 
cause virulence (pathogenic hostility).
7. How is genetic engineering 
used to create bacteria 
capable of producing human 
insulin?
In the production of human insulin by 
bacteria the human insulin gene is 
incorporated into the genetic material of 
these microorganisms. The mutant 
bacteria multiply forming lineages of 
insulin-producing bacteria.
In bacteria there are circular strands of 
DNA called plasmids, minichromosomes 
which act as an accessory to the main 
DNA. To create a mutant bacteria 
capable of producing insulin a plasmid is 
submitted to the action of restriction 
enzymes (restriction endonucleases) 
specialized in cutting DNA fragments. 
The once circular plasmid is open by the 
restriction enzyme. The same enzyme is 
used to cut a human DNA molecule 
containing the insulin gene. The piece of 
human DNA containing the insulin gene 
then has its extremities bound to the 
plasmid with the help of DNA ligases. 
The recombinant plasmid containing the 
human insulin gene is then inserted into 
the bacteria.
Another human hormone already 
produced by recombinant bacteria is GH 
(somatotropin, or growth hormone).
The insertion of DNA molecules into 
cells of an individual is also the method 
of the gene therapy, a promising 
treatment for genetic diseases. In gene 
therapy cells from an organism deficient 
in the production of a given protein 
receive (by means of vectors, e.g., 
virus) pieces of DNA containing the 
protein gene and they then begin to 
synthesize the protein.
8. What is cloning?
Cloning is the making of an organism 
genetically identical to another by 
means of genetic engineering.
The basis of cloning is the nucleus 
transplantation technology. A nucleus 
from a cell is extracted, generally from 
an embryonic (not differentiated) cell 
and this nucleus is inserted into a 
previously enucleated reproductive cell 
(in general an egg cell); the egg is then 
implanted in the organ where the 
embryonic development will take place. 
If embryonic development occurs the 
new organism will have identical genetic

patrimony to the organism owner of the 
cell whose nucleus was used in the 
transplantation.
9. What is PCR? How does PCR 
works?
PCR, polymerase chain reaction, is a 
method to synthesize many copies of 
specific regions of a DNA molecule 
known as target-regions. Its inventor, 
Kary Mullis, won the Nobel prize for 
Chemistry in 1993.
First, the DNA to be tested is heated to 
cause the double helix to rupture and 
the polynucleotide chains to be 
exposed. Then small synthetic 
sequences of DNA known as primers 
and containing nucleotide sequences 
similar to the sequences of the 
extremities of the region to be studied 
(for example, a region containing a 
known gene exclusive of a given 
organism) are added. The primers 
paired with the original DNA in the 
extremities of the gene to be amplified. 
Enzymes known as polymerases, that 
catalyze DNA replication, and nucleotide 
supply are added. The primers then are 
completed and the chosen region is 
replicated. In the presence of more 
primers and more nucleotides millions of 
copies of that specific region are 
generated. (PCR is very sensitive even 
using a minimal amount of DNA).
10. What is the fact of 
Molecular Biology on which 
DNA fingerprint is based?
DNA fingerprint, the method of 
individual identification using DNA, is 
based on the fact that the DNA of every 
individual (with exception of identical 
twins and individual clones) contains 
nucleotide sequences exclusive to each 
individual.
Although normal individuals of the same 
species have the same genes in their 
chromosomes, each individual has 
different alleles and even in the inactive 
portions of the chromosomes 
(heterochromatin) there are differences 
in nucleotide sequences among 
individuals.
11. Why are the recombinant 
DNA technology and the 
nucleus transplantation 
technology still dangerous?
The recombinant DNA technology and 
the nucleus transplantation technology 
(cloning) are extremely dangerous since 
they are able to modify, in a very short 
time, the ecological balance that 
evolution has taken millions of years to 
create on the planet. During the 
evolutionary process, under the slow 
and gradual action of mutations, genetic 
recombinations and of natural selection 
species emerged and were modified and 
genetic patrimonies were formed. With 
genetic engineering however humans 
can mix and modify genes, making 
changes of unpredictable long term 
consequences, risking creating new 
plant or animal diseases, new types of 
cancers and new disease outbreaks. It 
is a field as potentially dangerous as the 
manipulation of nuclear energy.

12. What is the main moral 
problem about the cloning of 
human individuals?
Besides biological perils, a very serious 
moral problem involves the nucleus 
transplantation technology concerning 
humans: an individual right of a human 
being is offended when a man or 
woman is made as a copy of another.
Since it is impossible to first ask if the 
person to be generated wants or not to 
be a genetic copy of another person, 
certainly the most important human 
right is being offended, one's individual 
freedom, when a human being is 
obliged to be a genetic copy of another. 
It is indeed a danger to democracy, 
whose most basic principle must be 
nonviolation of individual freedom.

Biology Questions and Answers
Origin of Life
1. How old is the earth?
It is believed that the earth is 
approximately 4.5 billion years old.
2. How old is the universe?
From analysis of data collected by the 
Hubble telescope the age of the 
universe is estimated to be about 12 
billion years.
3. When did life appear on 
earth?
It is estimated that life on earth 
emerged about 3.5 billion years ago, 
thus 1 billion years after the formation 
of the planet.
4. Historically how has the 
origin of life on earth been 
explained?
The most recurrent explanation for the 
phenomenon of life on earth is the 
mythological. People from various parts 
of the world developed explanatory 
myths about the origin of animals and 
human beings. Some of those myths 
were incorporated into religions and 
almost all religions have metaphorical or 
transcendental explanations about the 
origin of life on the planet.
With the development of science new 
explanatory attempts have emerged. 
Notable among them are the 
spontaneous generation hypothesis, or 
abiogenesis, that asserted that living 
beings were created from nonliving 
material, the cosmic panspermia 
hypothesis, theory that life on earth is a 
result of seeding from the outer space, 
the autotrophic hypothesis, according to 
which the first living beings were 
autotrophs, and the heterotrophic 
hypothesis, the most accepted 
nowadays, that affirms that life 
emerged from heterotrophic cells.
At the end of the 1980s decade a new 
hypothesis known as the RNA world 
hypothesis was presented. This 
hypothesis asserts that primitive life 
had only RNA as genetic material and as 
structural molecules that later turned 
into DNA and proteins. The RNA world 
hypothesis is strengthened by the fact 
that RNA can play a catalytic role, like 
enzymes, and by the finding that some 
bacteria have ribosomes made only of 
RNA without associated proteins.
5. What is the spontaneous 
generation hypothesis?
The spontaneous generation 
hypothesys, or abiogenesis, asserts that 
life on earth has come from nonliving 
material. For example, the fact that with 
time rats appeared around waste was 
considered in the past a confirmation of 
this hypothesis. Some supporters of 
spontaneous generation associated it 
with the existence of an active principle

(the vital elan) that would be the source 
of life, a theory known as vitalism.
6. How did the experiments of 
Redi and Pasteur refute the 
hypothesis of spontaneous 
generation?
To refute the spontaneous generation 
hypothesis many experiments were 
performed. Francisco Redi, in 1668, 
verified that maggots appeared on meat 
only when there was exposition to the 
environment; within closed 
environments, they did not appear. In 
1862, Louis Pasteur working with swan-
neck flasks refuted the abiogenesis 
hypothesis definitively. In this 
experiment Pasteur demonstrated that 
boiled (to kill microorganisms) nutritive 
soups put in swan-neck flasks (with a 
curved down mouth so microorganisms 
could not enter easily) did not 
contaminate with microorganisms while 
the same soups within flasks with open 
upwards mouths were contaminated in 
a few days. The fact that both flasks 
were open refuted the argument of the 
vitalists that the vital elan could not 
enter the flasks. Pasteur broke the 
swan-necks of the flasks to demonstrate 
that proliferation of microorganism 
could happen if these beings were able 
to reach the broth.
7. What is panspermia?
Panspermia is a hypothesis that 
describes life on earth as not originated 
from the planet. The idea is that the 
first living beings that colonized the 
earth came from outer space, from 
other planets or even from other 
galaxies by traveling in meteorites, 
comets, etc. According to this 
hypothesis even the type of life now 
existent on earth could have also been 
seeded intentionally by extraterrestrial 
beings in other stellar and planetary 
systems.
8. What is the autotrophic 
hypothesis on the origin of 
life?
The autotrophic hypothesis on the origin 
of life asserts that the first living beings 
on earth were producers of their own 
food, just like plants and 
chemosynthetic microorganisms.
9. What is the heterotrophic 
hypothesis on the origin of 
life?
According to the heterotrophic 
hypothesis the first living beings were 
very simple heterotrophic organisms, 
i.e., not producers of their own food, 
which emerged from the gradual 
association of organic molecules into 
small organized structures (the 
coacervates). The first organic 
molecules in their turn would have 
appeared from substances of the earth's 
primitive atmosphere submitted to 
strong electrical discharges, to solar 
radiation and to high temperatures.

10. What is the most accepted 
hypothesis about the origin of 
life on earth? How does it 
compare to the other main 
hypotheses?
The heterotrophic hypothesis is the 
strongest and most accepted hypothesis 
about the origin of life.
The spontaneous generation hypothesis 
has been excluded by the experiments 
of Pasteur. The panspermia hypothesis 
is not yet completely refuted but it is 
not well-accepted since it would be 
necessary to explain how living beings 
could survive long space journeys under 
conditions of extreme temperatures as 
well as to clarify the manner by which 
they would resist the high temperatures 
faced when entering the earth's 
atmosphere. The autotrophic hypothesis 
is weakened if one takes into account 
that the production of organic material 
from inorganic substances is a highly 
complex process requiring diversified 
enzymatic systems and that the 
existence of complex metabolic 
reactions on the primitive earth were 
not probable.
11. Before the emergence of 
life of what gases was the 
earth's primitive atmosphere 
constituted?
The earth's primitive atmosphere was 
basically formed of methane, hydrogen, 
ammonia and water vapor.
12. What are the main 
constituents of the earth's 
atmosphere in our time?
The present atmosphere of the earth is 
constituted mainly of molecular nitrogen 
(N2) and molecular oxygen (O2). 
Nitrogen is the most abundant gas, 
approximately 80% of the total volume. 
Oxygen makes up about 20%. Other 
gases exist in the atmosphere in a low 
percentage. (Of great concern is the 
increase in the amount of carbon 
dioxide due to human activity, the cause 
of the threatening global warming.)
13. Was there molecular 
oxygen in the earth's primitive 
atmosphere? How has that 
molecule become abundant?
The presence of molecular oxygen in the 
primitive atmosphere was probably at a 
minimum and extremely rare. Oxygen 
became abundant with the emergence 
of photosynthetic beings, 
approximately, 1.5 billion years after 
the appearance of life on the planet.
14. Which physical elements 
contributed to the great 
amount of available energy on 
the primitive earth at the time 
of the origin of life?
3.5 billion years ago the water cycle was 
faster than today, resulting in hard 
storms with intense electrical 
discharges. There was also no chemical 
protection from the ozone layer against

ultraviolet radiation. The temperatures 
in the atmosphere and on the planet 
surface were very high. Electricity, 
radiation and heat constituted large 
available energy sources.
15. What was the experiment 
of Stanley Miller (1953) on the 
origin of life?
In 1953 Stanley Miller arranged an 
experimental apparatus that simulated 
the atmospheric conditions of the 
primitive earth. The experiment 
contained a mixture of methane, 
ammonia, hydrogen and circulating 
water that when heated was 
transformed into vapor. He submitted 
the mixture to continuous bombardment 
of electrical discharge and after days 
obtained a liquid residual within which 
he discovered organic molecules and 
among them surprisingly the amino 
acids glycine and alanine, the most 
abundant constituents of proteins. Other 
researchers reproduced the Miller 
experiment and noted also the 
formation of other organic molecules 
such as lipids, carbohydrates and 
nucleotides.
16. What are coacervates?
Coarcervates are small structures made 
of the aggregation of organic molecules 
under water solution. By electrical 
attraction the molecules join into bigger 
and more organized particles distinct 
from the fluid environment forming a 
membrane-like structure that separates 
an internal region of the coacervate 
from the exterior. The coacervates 
might divide themselves and also 
absorb and excrete substances. It is 
believed that these structures may have 
been the precursors of cells.
17. How can coacervates be 
formed of phospholipids or 
polypeptides?
Phospholipids are amphipathic 
molecules, i.e., they present a polar 
portion and a nonpolar portion. In 
contact with water these molecules tend 
to spontaneously unite and organize 
themselves forming membranes that 
create a closed interior space separated 
from the exterior environment. 
Polypeptide chains in their turn can 
attract water (by electrical attraction) 
forming a surrounding water layer and 
also creating an organized structure 
with delimited interior space.
18. How could coacervates 
have facilitated the 
emergence of life on earth?
Coacervates probably provided a nitid 
separation between an internal and an 
external environment and thus the 
organic material within was not lost to 
the ocean. The enzymatic action inside 
that internal environment could develop 
in different manners increasing the 
speed of specific chemical reactions. 
Coacervates also allowed the molecular 
flux across its membrane to be 
selective. Since containing different 
molecules and differently organized 
from each other, coacervates could 
have promoted a competition for

molecules from the environment setting 
out an evolutionary selection.
19. What is the evolutionary 
origin of the internal 
membranous organelles of the 
cell?
It is accepted that the internal 
membranous organelles of the 
eukaryotic, like the Golgi apparatus and 
the endoplasmic reticulum, appeared 
from invaginations of the external 
membrane of primitive cells.
20. How have prokaryotic cells 
given origin to aerobic 
eukaryotic cells and to 
photosynthetic aerobic 
eukaryotic cells?
According to the most accepted 
hypothesis aerobic eukaryotic cells 
emerged from the association of aerobic 
prokaryotes engulfed by primitive 
anaerobic eukaryotic cells. This would 
have been the origin of mitochondria 
that thus would have primitively been 
aerobic bacteria engulfed by eukaryotic 
anaerobes. This hypothesis is called the 
endosymbiotic hypothesis on the origin 
of mitochondria.
Chloroplasts would also have appeared 
by endosymbiosis from the entry of 
photosynthetic prokaryotes into aerobic 
eukaryotes, both establishing a 
mutualist ecological interaction.
21. What evidence 
strengthens the hypothesis 
that chloroplasts could have 
been photosynthetic 
prokaryotes and mitochondria 
could have been aerobic 
prokaryotes?
The fact that chloroplasts are the 
organelles responsible for 
photosynthesis in plants leads to the 
supposition that before symbiosis they 
were autotrophic prokaryotes. For the 
reason that mitochondria are the center 
of the aerobic cellular respiration, the 
powerhouse of the eukaryotic cell, it is 
supposed that they were once aerobic 
prokaryotes.
The endosymbiotic hypothesis to explain 
the emergence of aerobic and 
autotrophic eukaryotic beings is 
strengthened further by the following 
evidence: chloroplasts as well as 
mitochondria have their own DNA, 
similar to bacterial DNA; chloroplasts 
and mitochondria reproduce asexually 
by binary division, like bacteria do; both 
organelles have ribosomes and 
synthesize proteins.
22. How did the first 
fermenting autotrophs 
appeared? What about the 
first aerobic beings?
The heterotrophic hypothesis asserts 
that the first living beings were the 
fermenting heterotrophs. Fermentation 
released carbon dioxide (CO2) and then 
the atmosphere became enriched by 
this gas. By mutation and natural 
selection organisms capable of using

carbon dioxide and light to synthesize 
organic material appeared. These would 
have been the first photosynthetic 
beings (that were also fermenting 
beings since there was no abundance of 
oxygen).
Since photosynthesis is a reaction that 
releases molecular oxygen, with the 
emergence of fermenting autotrophs 
this gas became available. Some 
organisms then developed aerobic 
respiration using O2, a highly efficient 
method to produce energy.
23. Why is it more probable 
that the photosynthetic 
prokaryotes appeared before 
the aerobic eukaryotes?
It is more probable that photosynthetic 
prokaryotes appeared before the 
aerobic eukaryotes because without 
photosynthesis the earth's atmosphere 
would not be enriched with molecular 
oxygen, and without oxygen the 
existence of aerobic beings would not be 
possible.
24. What is an argument that 
shows that the emergence of 
photosynthetic beings was 
crucial for life to reach the 
marine surface and later the 
dry land?
Ultraviolet radiation from the sun was 
not disallowed to reach the surface of 
the primitive earth. Therefore the 
development of life on dry land or even 
near the aquatic surface was 
impracticable. Probably the first living 
beings lived submerged in deep water 
to avoid destruction by solar radiation. 
Only after the appearance of 
photosynthetic beings and the later 
filling of the atmosphere with oxygen 
released by them the formation of the 
atmospheric ozone layer that filters 
ultraviolet radiation was possible.

Biology Questions and Answers
Theory of Evolution
1. What is the problem that 
the theory of evolution and its 
rival theories try to solve?
The problem that the theory of 
evolution, or simply evolution, and its 
rival theories try to solve is to explain 
how the different living beings that live 
on earth have appeared.
2. What is the main theory 
opposed to evolution?
The main theory that opposes the 
evolution theory on the explanation of 
how species emerged (phylogenesis) is 
fixism.
3. What is fixism?
Fixism is the theory about the diversity 
of life on earth that affirms that the 
current existent species were identical 
to species of the past and came out 
already adapted to the environment 
without undergoing changes.
Fixism opposes evolutionism since 
evolutionism is the idea that current 
species emerged from gradual 
transformations suffered by ancestral 
and extinct species.
The religious version of fixism is called 
creationism. Many different forms of 
creationism are found in the mythology 
of various religions. Modernized 
religious interpreters teach creationism 
as a metaphorical wisdom and not as 
opposed to evolutionism.
Furthermore it is possible to make 
evolution compatible with creationism 
by considering that God in His 
perfection would not create a world so 
full of imperfections and sufferings like 
our world. One can maintain the 
creationist belief thinking that the world 
God created is another much better 
world or at least not the one that we 
see while admitting the imperfection of 
life that we see has emerged by 
evolution.
4. In the scientific competition 
against fixism what are the 
main arguments that favor 
evolutionism?
The main arguments in favor of 
evolutionism are: paleontological, from 
the study of similarities among fossils of 
different periods; of compared anatomy, 
the existence of structures with same 
origin and function and of residual 
organs, like the human appendix, that 
reveal relationships among species; of 
compared embryology, similarities of 
structures and developmental processes 
among embryos of related species; of 
molecular biology, larger percentage of 
similar nucleotide sequences in the DNA 
of species having common ancestors.

5. What are fossils?
Fossils are petrified vestiges of beings 
that lived in the past conserved by 
chemical and geological processes and 
found within rocks and sedimentary 
strata of the terrestrial crust.
6. How does the study of 
fossils strengthen the theory 
of evolution?
The study of fossils reveals ancient and 
extinct species having many similar 
structures to others of the present and 
of the past. Fossils still allow radioactive 
dating to estimate the periods during 
which species lived and to establish a 
chronological relationship between 
them. Those evidences strengthen the 
hypothesis of relationship and common 
origin among species and that their 
features have modified gradually until 
the formation of the current species.
7. Historically what were the 
two main evolutionary 
theories?
The two main evolutionary theories 
were lamarckism and darwinism.
8. What is meant by the law of 
use and disuse and by the law 
of the transmission of 
acquired characteristics?
According to the law of use and disuse 
the characteristics of a body vary as it is 
more or less used. This rule is valid for 
example for features like the muscular 
mass and the size of the bones.
The law of the transmission of acquired 
characteristics in its turn established 
that parents could transmit to their 
offspring characteristics acquired by the 
law of use and disuse.
9. What is lamarckism?
Lamarckism is the theory that unites the 
law of use and disuse with the law of 
the transmission of acquired 
characteristics, i.e., that asserted that 
acquired characteristics, for example, 
the muscular mass, could be 
transmitted from a parent to its 
offspring.
The theory was proposed by the French 
naturalist Lamarck in the beginning of 
the 19th century. At that time the idea 
was not so absurd since nobody knew 
how the transmission of hereditary 
characteristics occurred. (Lamarck had 
great merit in introducing an 
evolutionary theory based in natural law 
at a time dominated by fixism.)
10. Who was Charles Darwin?
Charles Darwin was an English 
naturalist born in 1809 and considered 
the father of the theory of evolution. At 
the end of the year 1831, before turning 
23 years of age, Darwin embarked as 
volunteer scientist on the ship the 
Beagle for a five year expedition to the

South American coast and the Pacific. 
During the voyage, whose most famous 
passage was the stop in the Galapagos 
Islands, Darwin collected data that he 
used to write his masterpiece “The 
Origin of Species” (1859). In this book 
the principles of the common ancestry 
of all living beings and of natural 
selection as the force that drives the 
diversity of species were described. 
Darwin died in 1882.
(The original name of the most famous 
book written by Darwin was “On the 
Origin of Species by Means of Natural 
Selection”.)
11. What is the mechanism 
described by Darwin that 
eliminates species less 
adapted to environmental 
conditions?
The mentioned mechanism is the 
natural selection.
12. How did Darwin reach the 
principle of natural selection 
from the observation of 
differences among individuals 
of the same species?
Darwin recognized that in a same 
species there were individuals with 
different characteristics. He also realized 
that those differences could lead to 
different survival and reproduction 
chances for each individual. Therefore 
he discovered the importance of the 
environment acting upon organisms and 
preserving those having more 
advantageous characteristics for 
survival and more able to generate 
offspring and so he described the basis 
of the principle of natural selection.
13. How did the industrial 
revolution in England offer an 
example of natural selection?
One of the classic examples of natural 
selection is regarding the moths of 
industrial zones of England in the end of 
the 19th century and the beginning of 
the 20th century. As the industrial 
revolution advanced the bark of the 
trees that moths landed on became 
darker due to the soot released from 
factories. The population of light moths 
then decreased and was substituted by 
a population of dark moths since the 
mimicry of the dark moths in the new 
environment protected them from 
predators, i.e., they had an adaptive 
advantage in that new environment. 
Light moths in their turn suffered the 
negative effect of natural selection for 
becoming more visible to predators and 
were almost eliminated. In the open 
forest far from factories however it was 
experimentally verified that light moths 
maintained their adaptive advantage 
and the dark moths continued to be 
more easily found by predators.
14. What are the fundamental 
similarities and differences 
between lamarckism and 
darwinism?
Both lamarckism and darwinism are 
evolutionary theories as opposed to

fixism, both admit the existence of 
processes that caused changes in the 
characteristics of the living beings in the 
past.
They have however different 
explanations for those changes. 
Lamarckism combines the law of use 
and disuse with the law of the 
transmission of acquired characteristics 
to explain the changes. Darwinism 
defends the action of the natural 
selection.
15. In the time of Darwin the 
results of Mendel’s research 
on biological inheritance had 
not been published, Genetics 
was not yet developed, 
neither DNA nor the concept 
of genetic mutation were 
known. What is the modern 
darwinist theory that 
incorporates these bodies of 
knowledge?
The modern darwinist theory that 
incorporates knowledge from Genetics 
and Molecular Biology is called 
neodarwinism, or synthetic theory of 
evolution.
16. How does the synthetic 
theory of evolution 
incorporate knowledge from 
Genetics and Molecular 
Biology into the darwinism?
Today it is known that variation of 
inherited characteristics is created by 
alterations in the genetic material of the 
individuals, more precisely by 
modifications or recombinations of DNA 
molecules. Small changes in the genetic 
material accumulate and new 
phenotypical characteristics emerge. 
The carriers of these characteristics 
then are submitted to natural selection. 
From modern Biology its recognized that 
natural selection generates in a given 
population an increase in the frequency 
of alleles and genes more favorable to 
survival and reproduction; less 
advantageous genes and alleles tend to 
be eliminated.
17. Using the concepts of 
variability, environmental 
pressure and natural selection 
how does the synthetic theory 
explain the darwinian natural 
selection?
Genetic variability occurs from 
recombination of chromosomes during 
sexual reproduction and from DNA 
mutations in germ cells and gametes. 
Such variability creates individuals who 
are carriers of some new phenotypical 
characteristics compared to their 
ancestors. These individuals are 
submitted to environmental pressure 
and can be more or less well-succeeded 
concerning survival or reproduction. 
Those better succeeded transmit their 
genetic patrimony to a larger number of 
descendants increasing the frequency of 
their genes in the population; those less 
well-succeeded tend to transmit their 
genes to a small number of descendants 
decreasing the frequency of their genes 
in the population or even becoming 
extinct. This process is called natural 
selection (preservation of organisms

that present more adapted phenotypes 
for the environmental pressure they 
face).
18. In hospitals where many 
tuberculosis patients are 
treated the population of the 
tuberculosis mycobacteria 
may be constituted of 
multiresistant (to antibiotics) 
strains. How does the 
synthetic theory of evolution 
explain this fact?
The appearance of multiresistant strains 
of pathogenic parasites in hospitals, for 
example, of multiresistant tuberculosis 
bacteria, can be explained by the 
synthetic theory of evolution.
As in any environment, TB bacteria in 
hospitals undergo changes in their 
genetic material. In the hospital 
environment however they suffer 
continuous exposition to antibiotics. 
Many of them die by the antibiotic 
action but carriers of mutations that 
provide resistance to those antibiotics 
proliferate freely. These resistant 
microorganisms when submitted to 
other antibiotics again undergo natural 
selection and those which became 
resistant to these other drugs are 
preserved and proliferate. Thus strains 
of multiresistant (nontreatable) mutant 
bacteria emerge in hospitals.
The use of antibiotics is a factor that 
promotes natural selection and the 
emergence of multiresistant bacteria. 
This is the reason why hospitals often 
have committees that control the use of 
antibiotics.
19. What is reproductive 
isolation?
Living beings are considered under 
reproductive isolation when they cannot 
cross among themselves or if they can 
cross but cannot generate fertile 
offspring.
20. What is the relationship 
between the concept of 
reproductive isolation and the 
concept of species?
Reproductive isolation is an important 
concept because it defines the concept 
of species: only living beings that can 
cross among themselves and generate 
fertile offspring, i.e., that are not under 
reproductive isolation, belong to the 
same species. For example, humans 
and chimps are under reproductive 
isolation and are not of the same 
species.
21. What is speciation?
Speciation is the process by which 
different species emerge from a 
common ancestor species. Speciation 
generally begins when populations of 
the same species become 
geographically isolated, i.e., when they 
are separated by some physical barrier 
that disallows crossing between 
individuals from one population and 
individuals of another population.
Groups that for a long time are kept 
under geographical isolation tend to 
accumulate different phenotypical

characteristics from each other by 
means of genetic variability (mutations 
and recombination) and natural 
selection. When those differences reach 
a point that makes the crossing of 
individuals of one group with individuals 
of the other group impossible or the 
generation of fertile offspring no longer 
happens it is said that speciation has 
occurred.
22. Why does geographical 
isolation lead to speciation?
Geographical isolation between groups 
of the same species leads to formation 
of a new species since it disallows 
crossing among isolated individuals. 
Distinct characteristics from the other 
groups are incorporated by genetic 
variability and natural selection into the 
isolated groups until the emergence of a 
new species. So the geographical 
isolation creates the reproductive 
isolation.
23. How can the fact that 
fishes and dolphins have 
similar organs and similar 
general shape be explained?
Fishes and dolphins have similar organs 
and shape because although they have 
phylogenetically distant ancestors they 
face similar environmental pressures 
since they share the same habitat 
(water). So by undergoing genetic 
variability and natural selection some 
similar features, for example, the 
hydrodynamic body and the presence of 
fins, were incorporated into these 
animals.
24. What is adaptive 
convergence?
Adaptive convergence is the 
phenomenon by which living beings 
facing the same environmental pressure 
(problems) and undergoing genetic 
variability and natural selection 
incorporate similar (analogous) organs 
and structures (solutions) into their 
bodies during evolution. For example, 
the fins and the hydrodynamic body of 
fishes and dolphins, phylogenetically 
distant animals.
25. What is adaptive 
radiation?
Adaptive radiation is the appearance of 
several other species from one common 
ancestral species that have spread to 
various regions or environments. The 
different characteristics among the 
species correspond to the adaptive 
necessities of the ecological niches each 
one occupies, i.e., to different 
environmental pressures.
26. What is the difference 
between analogous and 
homologous organs?
Characteristics of different species are 
said to be analogous when having the 
same biological function, for example, 
the wings of bats and the wings of 
insects.
Characteristics of different species are 
said to be homologous when having the

Biology Questions and Answers
Concepts of Ecology
1. What is Ecology?
Ecology is the field of Biology that 
studies the relationship between living 
beings and between living beings and 
the environment.
2. What is a species?
A species is a set of living beings able to 
cross among themselves generating 
fertile offspring.
This concept however does not apply to 
individuals of exclusive asexual 
reproduction and so other definitions 
have been proposed. For example, “a 
species is a set of living beings that 
evolve in a common manner all of them 
considered ancestors of the same type 
in relation to common descendants”.
3. What is a population?
A population is a set of individuals of 
the same species found in a given place 
in a given time.
4. What is a community? What 
is the difference between the 
concepts of community and 
population?
A community is a set of populations of 
living beings that live in the same 
region and interact with each other.
In Ecology a population is a set whose 
members (living in a given place in a 
given time) are part of the same 
species. A community is a set of 
populations of different species (living in 
a given place in a given time).
5. What is the difference 
between an ecological niche 
and a habitat?
An ecological niche is a set of peculiar 
activities, resources and strategies that 
a species explores to survive and 
reproduce.
An habitat is the place where the 
species lives to explore its ecological 
niche.
In other words it can be said that the 
habitat is the “address” of the species 
and the ecological niche is the 
“profession” of the species.
6. What are biotic factors?
Biotic factors are living beings (plants, 
animals and microorganisms) that are 
part of a given environment.

Biology Questions and Answers
Abiotic factors are the nonliving 
elements that constitute a given 
environment, like light, temperature, 
minerals, water, gases, atmospheric 
pressure, etc.
8. What is an ecosystem?
An ecosystem is a system composed of 
biotic and abiotic factors in interaction.
9. What is a biosphere?
A biosphere is a set of all of the 
ecosystems of the planet.
10. What are autotrophic 
beings? What are 
heterotrophic beings?
Autotrophic beings are those that can 
produce their own food, i.e., that make 
organic material from inorganic 
compounds. Heterotrophic beings are 
those that need to incorporate organic 
material to nourish themselves. 
Therefore heterotrophs depend on the 
production of the autotrophs.
11. What are the processes 
that autotrophic beings use to 
produce organic material from 
inorganic substances?
Autotrophic beings make organic 
material by photosynthesis or by 
chemosynthesis. There are 
photosynthetic autotrophs, like plants, 
and chemosynthetic autotrophs, like 
some bacteria.

Biology Questions and Answers
Earth's Biomes
1. What is a biome?
A biome is a prevailing ecosystem 
constituted by similar biotic and abiotic 
factors present in one or more regions 
of the planet.
2. What are the major 
terrestrial biomes?
The major terrestrial biomes are: 
tundra, taigas (or boreal forest), 
temperate forests, tropical forests, 
grasslands and deserts.
3. What are the typical 
vegetation and the typical 
fauna of the tundra?
Tundra has vegetation formed mainly by 
mosses and lichens. In the fauna the 
densely furred animals, like caribous, 
musk oxen and polar bears, and also 
migratory birds are found.
4. What are the typical 
vegetation and the typical 
fauna of the taigas?
Taiga, or the boreal forest, is 
characterized by coniferous trees, pine 
forests. There are also mosses, lichens, 
small bushes and angiosperms. In the 
taiga many mammals, like moose, 
wolves, foxes and rodents, migratory 
birds and a great diversity of insects are 
found.
5. What are the typical 
vegetation and the typical 
fauna of the temperate 
forests?
In the temperate forest deciduous trees 
predominate. Mammals are found in 
great number, like bears and deer.
6. What are deciduous trees?
Deciduous trees are plants that lose 
their leaves in a period of the year. In 
the case of the deciduous trees of the 
temperate forest the fall of the leaves 
occurs in the autumn (fall). The loss of 
leaves is a preparation to face the cold 
months of the winter: roots, stem and 
branches are more resistant to low 
temperature and snow than the leaves; 
without leaves the metabolic rate of the 
plant is reduced; the decaying fallen 
leaves help to nourish the soil.
7. What is the typical 
localization of the tropical 
forests regarding latitude?
Tropical rain forests, like the Amazon 
forest and the Congo forest, are 
typically located in low latitude, i.e., in 
the equatorial and tropical zones.

Biology Questions and Answers
8. What are the typical 
vegetation and the typical 
fauna of the tropical forests?
In the vegetation of the tropical forests 
broadleaf evergreen trees predominate. 
On the top of the trees epiphytes and 
lianas grow. Many varieties of 
pteridophytes can be found in these 
forests. Regarding the fauna, the 
abundance and diversity is also great: 
there are monkeys, rodents, bats, 
insectivores, felines, reptiles, birds, 
amphibians and invertebrates, mainly 
insects.
9. How can the abundance and 
diversity of living beings in 
the tropical forests be 
explained?
The biodiversity of these ecosystems 
can be explained by the great 
availability of the main abiotic factors 
for photosynthesis. Since these factors 
are abundant plants can perform 
maximum photosynthetic activity, living 
and reproducing easily. With a great 
amount and diversity of producers 
(autotrophs), the consumers 
(heterotrophic animals and 
microorganisms) also have abundant 
food and a complex food web emerges 
creating many different ecological 
niches to be explored. So the 
appearance of varied living beings as 
well as the existence of large 
populations is possible.
10. Why are the tropical 
forests also known as 
stratified forests?
In tropical forests tall trees of several 
species have their crowns forming a 
superior layer under which diverse other 
trees and plants develop forming other 
inferior layers. From the upper layer to 
the inferior layers the penetration of 
light lowers gradually and the exposition 
to wind and rain, the moisture and the 
temperature also vary. Different 
compositions of abiotic factors condition 
the prevailing of different vegetation in 
each layer.
11. What is the typical 
vegetation of the grasslands?
Grasslands are mainly formed of 
herbaceous (nonwoody) vegetation: 
grass, bushes and small trees.
12. What are the grasslands of 
North America and of South 
America respectively called?
The steppe grasslands of North America 
are called prairies. The grasslands of 
South America are known as “pampas” 
(the steppe grassland) and “cerrado” 
(the savannah grassland).

Biology Questions and Answers
Grasslands may be classified into 
steppes and savannahs. In the steppes 
the prevailing vegetation is grass, as in 
the pampas of South America and in the 
prairies of North America. The fauna is 
mainly formed by herbivores, like 
rodents and ungulates. The savannahs 
present small trees, for example in the 
Brazilian cerrado or the African 
savannahs. The fauna is diverse; in the 
Brazilian cerrado there are animals like 
ostriches, lizards, armadillos, jaguars, 
etc., and many types of insects; the 
African savannahs are the home of large 
herbivores and carnivores, like zebras, 
giraffes, antelopes, lions and leopards.
14. What are the typical 
vegetation and the typical 
fauna of the deserts?
The predominant fauna of desert 
ecosystems is formed by reptiles, like 
lizards and snakes, terrestrial 
arthropods and small rodents. In these 
areas plants very adapted to a dry 
climate may be found, like the cactus, 
which are plants that do not have real 
leaves and thus lose less water, along 
with grasses and bushes near places 
where water is available.
15. Which terrestrial 
vertebrate group is extremely 
rare in deserts?
Amphibians are terrestrial vertebrates 
extremely rare in desert environments 
(although there are a few species 
adapted to this type of ecosystem). 
Amphibians are rare in deserts because 
they do not have a permeable skin and 
so they easily lose water by evaporation 
and desiccate. They also need an 
aquatic environment to reproduce, since 
their fecundation is external and their 
larva is water-dependent.
16. What are plankton, nekton 
and benthos?
Plankton, nekton and benthos are the 
three groups into which aquatic living 
beings may be divided.
The plankton is formed by the algae and 
small animals that float near the water 
surface carried by the stream. The 
nekton is composed of animals that 
actively swim and dive in water, like 
fishes, turtles, whales, sharks, etc. The 
benthos comprises the animals 
ecologically linked to the bottom, 
including many echinoderms, benthonic 
fishes, crustaceans, molluscs, poriferans 
and annelids.
17. What are the 
phytoplankton and the 
zooplankton?
Phytoplankton and zooplankton are 
divisions of the plankton. The 
phytoplankton comprises the 
autotrophic floating beings: algae and 
cyanobacteria. The zooplankton is 
formed by the heterotrophic planktonic 
beings: protozoans, small crustaceans, 
cnidarians, larvae, etc.

Biology Questions and Answers
Food Chains and 
Trophic Pyramids
1. What is the primary energy 
source for life on earth?
The primary energy source for life on 
earth is the sun. The sun plays the 
important role of keeping the planet 
warmed and it is the source of the 
luminous energy used in 
photosynthesis. This energy is 
converted into organic material by the 
photosynthetic autotrophic beings and 
consumed by the other living beings.
2. What is the main means by 
which autotrophic beings 
obtain energy?
The main means by which autotrophs 
obtain energy is photosynthesis. (There 
are also chemosynthetic autotrophs.)
3. Which is the autotrophic 
group responsible for the 
production of most part of the 
molecular oxygen of earth?
Algae and cyanobacteria of the 
phytoplankton are the organisms that 
contribute most to the production of 
molecular oxygen.
4. In the ecological study of 
food interactions, what are 
the autotrophic beings called?
In Ecology autotrophic beings are called 
producers because they synthesize the 
organic material consumed by the other 
living beings of an ecosystem.
An ecosystem cannot exist without 
producers.
5. How are the heterotrophic 
beings divided in the 
ecological study of food 
interactions?
Heterotrophs are divided into 
consumers and decomposers. An 
ecosystem can exist without consumers 
but it cannot be sustained without 
decomposers. Without the decomposers 
the organic material would accumulate 
causing environmental degradation and 
later death of the living beings.
6. What is a food chain?
The food chain is the linear not 
branched sequence in which a living 
being serves as food for another, 
starting with the producers and going 
up to the decomposers.

Biology Questions and Answers
7. How is energy transferred 
along a food chain?
The energy flux along a food chain is 
always unidirectional, from the 
producers to the decomposers.
8. What are trophic levels? 
How many trophic levels can a 
food chain have?
Trophic levels correspond to positions 
on a food chain. Therefore producers 
always belong to the first trophic level 
and decomposers to the last trophic 
level, consumers that directly eat the 
producers belong to the second trophic 
level and so on.
There is no limit regarding the number 
of trophic levels on a chain, since many 
orders of consumers can exist.
9. What are primary 
consumers? Can a food chain 
present quaternary consumers 
without having secondary or 
tertiary consumers? Can a 
tertiary consumer of one chain 
be a primary or secondary 
consumer of another chain?
Primary consumers are living beings 
that eat autotrophic beings, i.e., they 
eat the producers. Primary consumers 
always belong to the second trophic 
level of a chain.
A food chain cannot have consumers of 
superior orders without having the 
consumer of the inferior orders. A 
consumer however can participate in 
several different chains not always 
belonging to the same consumer order 
in each of them.
10. What is the difference 
between the concepts of food 
chain and food web?
The chain concept is a theoretical model 
to study the energy flux in ecosystems. 
Actually in an ecosystem the organisms 
are part of several interconnected food 
chains, forming a food web. Therefore 
the chain is a theoretical linear 
sequence and the web is a more 
realistic representation of nature in 
which the food chains interconnect 
forming a web.
11. What are the three main 
types of trophic pyramids 
studied in Ecology?
The three types of trophic pyramids 
studied in Ecology are the numeric 
pyramid, the biomass pyramid and the 
energy pyramid.
Generally the variable dimension of the 
pyramid is the width, and the height is 
always the same for each represented 
strata of living beings. The width 
therefore represents the number of 
individuals, or the total mass of these 
individuals or the available energy in 
each trophic level.

Biology Questions and Answers
12. What do numeric pyramids 
represent?
Numeric pyramids represent the number 
of individuals in each trophic level of a 
food chain.
13. In a numeric pyramid to 
which trophic level does the 
base always refer? What 
about the top level?
In a numeric pyramid the base 
corresponds to the first trophic level, 
i.e., to the producers. The top level of 
the pyramid corresponds generally to 
the last consumer order of the food 
chain (since the number of individual 
decomposers, most of them 
microorganisms, is too large to be 
represented).
14. In a numeric pyramid is it 
possible for the base to be 
smaller than the other levels?
Since the numeric pyramid represents 
the quantity of individuals in each 
trophic level of the food chain, inferior 
trophic levels with less individuals than 
the superior trophic levels may exist. 
For example, a single tree can serve as 
food to millions of insects.
15. In the short term what will 
happen to the levels above 
and below a population of 
secondary consumers of a 
numeric pyramid if a large 
number of individuals from 
this population dies?
If an intermediate level of a numeric 
pyramid has its variable dimension 
decreased, i.e., if the number of 
individuals of that level is reduced, the 
number of individuals of the level below 
will increase and the number of 
individuals of the level above will be 
reduced. That happens because the 
individuals of the level below will face 
less predators and the individuals of the 
level above will have less available food.
16. What do biomass pyramids 
represent?
Biomass pyramids represent the sum of 
the masses of the individuals that 
participate in each trophic level of a 
food chain.
17. What is dry mass?
When biomasses are compared often 
the concept of dry mass is used. The 
dry mass is the total mass less the 
water mass of an individual. The total 
mass is also called fresh mass. To use 
dry mass instead of fresh mass is useful 
because among living beings there are 
differences related to the proportion of 
water within their body and such 
differences can distort the quantitative

analysis of incorporated organic 
material.
18. What do energy pyramids 
represent?
Energy pyramids represent the amount 
of available energy in each trophic level 
of the food chain.
19. Into which type of energy 
is the light used in 
photosynthesis transformed?
The luminous energy used in 
photosynthesis is transformed into 
chemical energy.
20. Can the amount of 
available energy in a given 
trophic level be larger than 
the available energy in inferior 
trophic levels? What does that 
condition means to the 
conformation of the energy 
pyramids?
A superior trophic level always has less 
available energy than inferior trophic 
levels. This is because in each trophic 
level only a fraction of the organic 
material of the level below is 
incorporated into the consumers (into 
their bodies). The other part is 
eliminated as waste or is used in the 
metabolism as energy source. Therefore 
it is never possible to have energy 
pyramids with inverted conformation, 
i.e., with the tip to the bottom and the 
base to the top. It is also not possible to 
have superior trophic levels with a 
variable dimension larger than inferior 
ones. In every energy pyramid, from 
the base to the top, the size of the 
variable dimension decreases.
21. What is the gross primary 
production of an ecosystem? 
How does GPP relate to 
photosynthesis?
Gross primary production of an 
ecosystem, or GPP, is the quantity of 
organic material found in a given area in 
a given period.
Since only autotrophs produce organic 
material and photosynthesis is the main 
production process, GPP is a result of 
the photosynthesis.
22. What are the factors that 
for influencing photosynthesis 
also interfere with the gross 
primary productivity?
Mainly water and light, but also mineral 
salts, temperature and carbon dioxide 
are factors that interfere with the gross 
primary productivity.

23. What are the destinations 
of the organic material 
fabricated by the producers?
Part of the organic material synthesized 
by the producers is consumed as energy 
source for the metabolism of the own 
producer individual. The other part is 
incorporated (into the body) and 
becomes available to heterotrophic 
beings of the ecosystem. In each 
following trophic level part of the 
organic material is used in the 
metabolism of the individuals of the 
level, the other part is eliminated as 
waste and only a fraction is 
incorporated and becomes available as 
food for the following level.
24. What is the formula of the 
net primary production (NPP)? 
How does NPP relate to the 
energy pyramids?
Net primary production is the gross 
primary productivity less the organic 
material consumed as energy source in 
the metabolism of the producers: NPP = 
GPP – (organic material spent in aerobic 
respiration). It represents the organic 
material available in the first trophic 
level.
The base of the energy pyramids must 
represent the NPP and not the GPP since 
the idea of these pyramids is to show 
the available energy in each trophic 
level of the food chain.

Biology Questions and Answers
Biogeochemical 
Cycles
1. What are biogeochemical 
cycles?
Biogeochemical cycles are 
representations of the circulation and 
recycling of matter in nature.
The main biogeochemical cycles studied 
in Ecology are the water cycle, the 
carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle.
2. What is the respective 
importance of water, carbon 
and nitrogen for living beings?
Water is the main solvent of living 
beings and it is necessary practically for 
all biochemical reactions, including as 
reagent of photosynthesis. Many 
properties of water are very important 
for life.
Carbon is the main chemical element of 
organic molecules; carbon dioxide is 
also reagent of photosynthesis and 
product of the energetic metabolism of 
living beings.
Nitrogen is a fundamental chemical 
element of amino acids, the building 
blocks of proteins that in their turn are 
the main functional molecules of living 
beings; nitrogen is also part of the 
nucleic acid molecules, the basis of 
reproduction, heredity and protein 
synthesis.
3. What is the water cycle?
The water cycle represents the 
circulation and recycling of water in 
nature.
Liquid water on the planet surface is 
heated by the sun and turns into water 
vapor that gains the atmosphere. In the 
atmosphere large volumes of water 
vapor form clouds that when cooled 
precipitate liquid water as rain. 
Therefore water comes back to the 
planet surface and the cycle is 
completed. As possible steps of the 
cycle, water may still be stored in 
subterranean reserves or in the form of 
ice in mountains and oceans and it may 
also be used in the metabolism of living 
beings, incorporated into the body of 
the individuals or excreted through 
urine, feces and transpiration.
4. Why is the sun the “motor” 
of the water cycle?
The sun can be considered the motor of 
the water cycle because upon its energy 
the transformation of liquid water into 
water vapor depends. So the sun is the 
energy source that causes water to 
circulate in nature.
5. What is the carbon cycle?
The carbon cycle represents the 
circulation and recycling of the chemical 
element carbon in nature as a result of 
the action of living beings.

Biology Questions and Answers
Photosynthetic beings absorb carbon as 
carbon dioxide available in the 
atmosphere and the carbon atoms 
become part of glucose molecules. 
During the cellular respiration of these 
beings part of this organic material is 
consumed to generate ATP and in this 
process carbon dioxide is returned to 
the atmosphere. The other part is 
incorporated by the photosynthetic 
organisms into the molecules that 
compose their structure. The carbon 
atoms incorporated into the producers 
are transferred to the next trophic level 
and again part is liberated by the 
cellular respiration of the consumers, 
part becomes a constituent of the 
consumer body and part is excreted as 
uric acid or urea (excretes later recycled 
by decomposer bacteria). Therefore 
carbon absorbed by the producers in 
photosynthesis returns to the 
atmosphere through cellular respiration 
along the food chain until the 
decomposers that also liberate carbon 
dioxide in their energetic metabolism. 
Under special conditions in a process 
that takes millions of years carbon 
incorporated into organisms may also 
constitute fossil fuels stored in deposits 
under the surface of the planet; as fossil 
fuels burn the carbon atoms return to 
the atmosphere as carbon dioxide or 
carbon monoxide. The burning of 
vegetable fuels, like wood, also returns 
carbon to the atmosphere.
6. What is the main biological 
process that consumes carbon 
dioxide?
The main biological process that 
consumes carbon dioxide is 
photosynthesis.
7. How is carbon dioxide made 
by producers and consumers?
Carbon dioxide is made by producers 
and consumers through cellular 
respiration.
8. What are fossil fuels?
Fossil fuels, like oil, gas and coal, form 
when organic material is preserved from 
the complete action of decomposers, 
generally buried deep and under 
pressure over millions of years. Under 
such conditions the organic material 
transforms into hydrocarbon fuels.
Fossil fuels are a natural reservoir of 
carbon. When oxygen is present these 
fuels can be burned and carbon dioxide 
and carbon monoxide are released into 
the atmosphere.
9. What is the most abundant 
form under which nitrogen is 
found in nature?
The most abundant nitrogen-containing 
molecule found in nature is molecular 
nitrogen (N2). The air is 80% 
constituted of molecular nitrogen.
10. Under which form is 
nitrogen fixed by living 
beings?
Most living beings cannot use molecular 
nitrogen to obtain nitrogen atoms.

Biology Questions and Answers
Producers fix nitrogen mainly from 
nitrate (NO3
-). Some plants also fix 
nitrogen from ammonia. Consumers and 
decomposers acquire nitrogen through 
digestion of mainly proteins and nucleic 
acids from the body of other living 
beings.
11. What is the nitrogen 
cycle?
The nitrogen cycle represents the 
circulation and recycling of the chemical 
element nitrogen in nature.
The nitrogen cycle basically depends on 
the action of some specialized bacteria. 
Bacteria of the soil called nitrogen-fixing 
bacteria present in plant roots absorb 
molecular nitrogen from the air and 
liberate nitrogen in the form of 
ammonia. The decomposition of organic 
material also produces ammonia. In the 
soil and roots (mainly of leguminous 
plants), a first group of chemosynthetic 
bacteria called nitrifying bacteria, the 
nitrosomonas, produces energy 
consuming ammonia and releasing 
nitrite (NO2). The second group of 
nitrifying bacteria, the nitrobacteria, 
uses nitrite in chemosynthesis releasing 
nitrate (NO3). In the form of nitrate, 
nitrogen is then incorporated by plants 
to be used as constituent of proteins 
and nucleic acids and the element then 
follows along the food chain. Nitrogen 
returns to the atmosphere by the action 
of denitrifying bacteria that use 
nitrogen-containing compounds from 
the soil and release nitrogen gas 
(molecular nitrogen).
12. Why is a leguminous crop 
rotation used in agriculture?
Leguminous crop rotation and other 
crop rotations are used in agriculture 
because in these plants many bacteria 
important for the nitrogen cycle live. 
The leguminous crop rotation (or 
cojointly with the main crop) helps the 
soil to become rich in nitrates that are 
then absorbed by the plants.
Green manure, the covering of the soil 
with grass and leguminous plants, is 
also a way to improve the fixation of 
nitrogen and it is an option in avoiding 
chemical fertilizers.

Biology Questions and Answers
Biodiversity
1. What is biodiversity?
Biological diversity is the variety of 
species of living beings of an 
ecosystem. In ecosystems which are 
more biodiverse, like tropical forests, a 
great variety of plants, microorganisms 
and animals live; in ecosystems less 
biodiverse, like deserts, there are less 
variety of living beings.
2. How does biological 
diversity relate to the 
characteristics of the abiotic 
factors of an ecosystem?
The availability of abiotic factors like 
light, moisture, mineral salts, heat and 
carbon dioxide, more or less conditions 
the biodiversity of an ecosystem. 
Photosynthesis depends on water and 
light, and plants also need mineral salts, 
carbon dioxide and adequate 
temperature for their cells to work. In 
environments where these factors are 
not restrictive the synthesis of organic 
material (by photosynthesis) is at a 
maximum, plants and algae can 
reproduce easier, the population of 
these beings increase, potential 
ecological niches multiply and new 
species emerge. The large mass of 
producers makes viable the appearing 
of a diversity of consumers of several 
orders. In environments with restrictive 
abiotic factors, like deserts, the 
producers exist in small numbers and 
less diversity, a feature that thus 
extends to consumers and conditions 
fewer ecological niches to be explored.
3. How does the vegetal 
stratification of an ecosystem 
influence the biological 
diversity?
The vegetal stratification of an 
ecosystem, like the strata of the 
Amazon Rainforest, creates vertical 
layers with peculiar abiotic and biotic 
factors, dividing the ecosystem into 
several different environments. 
Therefore in the superior layer near the 
crowns of big trees the exposition to 
light, rain and wind is greater but 
moisture is lower compared to the 
inferior layers. As one goes down the 
strata the penetration of light 
diminishes and moisture increases. 
Regarding the biotic factors, 
communities of each stratum present 
ing differcomposition and features, food 
habits, reproduction strategies, etc. 
Such variations in the abiotic and biotic 
factors make the selective pressure 
upon living beings to be also diversified, 
there are more ecological niches to be 
explored and more varied beings 
emerge during the evolutionary process.
4. Despite having a great 
biodiversity why is the 
Amazon Rainforest under risk 
of desertification?

enriched by the vegetal covering made 
of leaves and branches that fall from the 
trees. Deforestation reduces this 
enrichment. In deforestation zones the 
rain falls directly on the ground causing 
erosion, “washing” large areas 
(leaching) and contributing to make the 
soil even less fertile. Besides that, the 
deforestation disallows the recycling of 
essential nutrients for plants, like 
nitrogen. In this manner those regions 
and their neighboring regions undergo 
desertification.
5. How can a great biological 
diversity protect an ecosystem 
from environmental damage? 
Why are less biodiverse 
ecosystems at risk of suffering 
deep biological harm if 
submitted to even small 
changes?
In ecosystems with more biodiversity 
the food webs and ecological 
interactions among living beings are 
more complex and diverse. In these 
ecosystems environmental changes can 
be more easily compensated by the 
multiplicity of available resources, foods 
and survival options.
In ecosystems with less biodiversity the 
individuals are more dependent on 
some beings that serve them as food 
and they interact with a small number 
of different species. In these 
ecosystems generally abiotic factors are 
restrictive and the species are more 
specialized to such conditions and more 
sensitive to environmental changes. So 
even small environmental harm can 
cause big disturbances in the 
equilibrium of the ecosystem.
6. Is monoculture a system 
that contributes to great 
biological diversity of an 
ecosystem?
Monoculture means that in a large area 
a single crop (only one species of plant) 
is cultivated. Therefore monoculture 
does not contribute to the formation of 
a community with great variety of 
species in the area. Since there is only a 
single type of producer the types of 
consumers that can live in the area are 
also restricted.
7. What are some economic 
applications that can be 
generated by very biodiverse 
ecosystems?
Very biodiverse areas present enormous 
economic potential. They can be a 
source of raw material for the research 
and production of medicines, cosmetics, 
chemical products and food. They are 
depositories of genetic wealth that can 
be explored by biotechnology. They are 
sources of species for agriculture. They 
can also be explored by 'ecological 
tourism'.

Biology Questions and Answers
8. What are the main causes 
of the loss of biological 
diversity nowadays?
The biggest dangers to biological 
diversity today are the action of 
humans. The main of them is the 
destruction of habitats caused by the 
growth of the cities, deforestation, 
pollution and fires. The second is the 
invasion of ecosystems by nonnative 
species introduced by humans; these 
species change the equilibrium of 
ecosystems causing harm. Other big 
dangers are predatory hunting and 
fishing and global warming.

Biology Questions and Answers
Ecological 
Interactions
1. What is inharmonious 
ecological interaction?
Inharmonious, or negative, ecological 
interaction is that in which at least one 
of the participating beings is harmed.
2. How are ecological 
interactions classified?
Ecological interactions are classified as 
intraspecific or interspecific interactions 
and as harmonious or inharmonious 
interactions.
3. What are intraspecific and 
interspecific ecological 
interactions?
Intraspecific ecological interactions are 
those between individuals of the same 
species. Interspecific ecological 
interactions are ecological interactions 
between individuals of different species.
4. What is inharmonious 
ecological interaction?
Inharmonious, or negative, ecological 
interaction is that in which at least one 
of the participating beings is harmed.
5. What is harmonious 
ecological interaction?
Harmonious, or positive, ecological 
interaction is that in which none of the 
participating beings is harmed.
6. What are the main 
intraspecific ecological 
interactions?
The main harmonious intraspecific 
ecological interactions are colonies and 
societies. The main inharmonious 
intraspecific ecological interactions are 
intraspecific competition and 
cannibalism.
7. What are colonies and 
societies?
Colonies are functional integrated 
aggregates formed by individuals of the 
same species. Colonies are often 
confused with a single individual. 
Examples are the coral reefs, by-the-
wind sailors and filamentous algae.
Societies are interactions for labor 
division and collaboration among 
individuals of the same species. Human 
societies are examples of ecological 
societies; other species, like bees, ants, 
termites, wolves and dolphins, also form 
societies.

Biology Questions and Answers
8. What is competition? Which 
type of ecological interaction 
is competition?
Competition is the ecological interaction 
in which the individuals explore the 
same ecological niche or their ecological 
niches partially coincide and therefore 
competition for the same environmental 
resources takes place.
Competition is harmful for all 
participating beings and thus it is 
classified as an inharmonious (negative) 
ecological interaction.
9. What is an example of 
intraspecific competition?
Intraspecific competition occurs in 
practically all species, for example, the 
competition of humans for a job.
10. Why is cannibalism an 
inharmonious intraspecific 
ecological interaction?
In cannibalism an individual eats other 
of the same species (occurs in some 
insects and arachnids). Since it is an 
interaction between beings of the same 
species and at least one of them is 
harmed (the other is benefited) the 
classification as inharmonious 
intraspecific ecological interaction is 
justified.
11. What are the main 
interspecific ecological 
interactions?
The main harmonious interspecific 
ecological interactions are: 
protocooperation, mutualism and 
commensalism. The main inharmonious 
interspecific ecological interactions are: 
interspecific competition, parasitism, 
predatism and ammensalism.
12. What is protocooperation?
Protocooperation is the ecological 
interaction in which both participants 
benefit but which is not obligatory for 
their survival. Protocooperation is a 
harmonious (positive) interspecific 
ecological interaction. Examples of 
protocooperation are: the action of the 
spur-winged plover that using its beak 
eats residuals from crocodile teeth; the 
removal of ectoparasites from the back 
of bovines by some birds that eat the 
parasites; the hermit crab that live 
inside shells over which sea anemones 
live (these offer protection to the crab 
and gain mobility to obtain food).
13. What is mutualism?
Mutualism is the ecological interaction in 
which both participants benefit and that 
is obligatory for their survival. 
Mutualism is a harmonious (positive) 
ecological interaction. Mutualism is also 
known as symbiosis. Examples of 
mutualism are: the association between 
microorganisms that digest cellulose 
and the ruminants or insects within 
which they live; the lichens, formed by

algae or cyanobacteria that make 
organic material for the fungi and 
absorb water with their help; nitrifying 
bacteria of the genus Rhizobium that 
associated to leguminous plants offer 
nitrogen to these plants.
14. What is commensalism?
Commensalism is the ecological 
interaction in which one individual 
benefits while the other is neither 
benefited nor harmed. Commensalism is 
a harmonious (positive) ecological 
interaction, since none of the 
participants is harmed. An example of 
commensalism is the numerous bacteria 
that live in the skin and in the digestive 
tube of humans without being 
pathogenic or beneficial. They are 
innocuous bacteria living in 
commensalism with humans.
15. What benefits can 
commensalism offer to a 
species?
Commensalism may involve obtainment 
of food (for example, the innocuous 
bacteria of the human gut), shelter or 
support (epiphytes on trees) and 
transportation (pollen carried by insects 
or birds). The commensalism that 
involves obtainment of shelter is also 
called inquilinism.
16. What are some examples 
of interspecific competition?
Examples of interspecific competition 
are: the dispute among vultures, 
worms, flies and microorganisms for 
carrion and the competition between 
snakes and eagles for rodents.
17. What is parasitism?
Parasitism is the ecological interaction in 
which a being lives at the expense of 
another. The parasite often does not 
cause immediate death of the host since 
it needs the host alive to survive.
Parasitism is an inharmonious 
(negative) interspecific ecological 
interaction, since although one 
participant benefit the other is harmed.
18. What are some examples 
of parasitism?
Classical examples are the parasites of 
humans (host), like the trypanosome 
that causes Chagas’ disease, the HIV 
virus (AIDS), the bacteria that causes 
tuberculosis, the schistosome that 
causes schistosomiasis, the hookworms, 
etc. Other examples are: tree (host) 
and parasitic helminths (parasite), dog 
(host) and lice (parasite), cattle (host) 
and tick (parasite), etc.
19. What is predatism?
Predatism is the ecological interaction in 
which one individual mutilates or kills 
another to get food. Predatism is an

Biology Questions and Answers
inharmonious (negative) ecological 
interaction since one participant is 
harmed.
20. Is herbivorism a form of 
predatism?
Herbivorism is a form of predatism in 
which first order consumers feed from 
producers (plants or algae). For 
example, birds and fruits, humans and 
edible vegetables, etc. (There are 
proposals to consider the herbivorism of 
leaves a form of parasitism and the 
herbivorism of entire plants and seeds a 
form of predatism).
21. What is ammensalim?
Ammensalism is the ecological 
interaction in which an individual harms 
another without obtaining benefit. 
Ammensalism is an inharmonious 
(negative) ecological interaction since 
one participant is harmed.
(Sometimes it is wrongly said that 
ammensalism is a form of ecological 
interaction in which an organism 
releases in the environment substances 
that harm another species; this 
situation is indeed an example of 
ammensalim but the concept is not 
restricted to it.)
One of the best examples of 
ammensalism is the one established 
between humans and other species 
under extinction due to human actions 
like habitat devastation by fires, 
ecological accidents, leisure hunting, 
etc. Anther example is the red tide, 
proliferation of algae that by 
intoxication can lead to death of fishes 
and other animals.

Biology Questions and Answers
Ecological 
Succession
1. What is ecological 
succession?
Ecological succession is the changing 
sequence of communities that live in an 
ecosystem during a given time period.
2. What are pioneer species? 
What is the role of the pioneer 
species?
Pioneer species are those first species 
that colonize places where previously 
there were no living beings, like, for 
example, algae that colonize bare rocks. 
In general, pioneer species are 
autotrophs or those that maintain 
harmonious ecological interaction with 
autotrophic beings (like autotrophic 
bacteria, herbaceous plants, lichens).
The pioneer community is formed of 
species able to survive under hostile 
environments. The presence of these 
species modifies the microenvironment 
generating changes in abiotic and biotic 
factors of the ecosystem undergoing 
formation. Therefore they open the way 
to other species to establish in the place 
by the creation of new potential 
ecological niches.
3. What is the difference 
between primary ecological 
succession and secondary 
ecological succession?
Primary ecological succession is the 
changing sequence of communities from 
the first biological occupation of a place 
where previously there were no living 
beings. For example, the colonization 
and the following succession of 
communities on a bare rock.
Secondary ecological succession is the 
changing sequence of communities from 
the substitution of a community by a 
new one in a given place. For example, 
the ecological succession of the invasion 
of plants and animals in an abandoned 
crop or land.
4. What is the climax stage of 
an ecological succession?
The climax stage is the stage of the 
ecological succession in which the 
community of an ecosystem becomes 
stable and does not undergo significant 
changes. In the climax community 
practically all ecological niches are 
explored and greater biodiversity is 
possible. In this stage the biomass, the 
photosynthesis rate and the cellular 
respiration reach their maximum levels 
and thus the net primary production 
(NPP = organic material made by the 
producers – organic material consumed 
in the cellular respiration of the 
producers) tends to zero. At the climax 
the amount of oxygen released by 
photosynthesis is practically equal to 
the oxygen consumed by respiration. 
(This is one more reason why it is

Biology Questions and Answers
wrong to say that the Amazon 
Rainforest, an ecosystem at climax 
stage, is “the lung” of the earth. Other 
reasons are: lungs are not producers of 
oxygen; the algae and cyanobacteria of 
the phytoplankton are the main 
producers of the molecular oxygen of 
the planet.)
5. How do biodiversity, the 
total number of living beings 
and the biomass respectively 
vary during the ecological 
succession?
Biodiversity, the number of living beings 
and the biomass of an ecosystem tend 
to increase as the succession progresses 
and they stabilize when the climax 
stage is reached.
At the initial stage of the succession the 
use of carbon dioxide and the fixation of 
carbon into the biomass are high, since 
the total number of living beings in the 
ecosystem is increasing. At the climax 
stage the use of carbon dioxide by 
photosynthesis equals the production by 
cellular respiration and the fixation of 
carbon into the biomass tends to zero.

Biology Questions and Answers
Population Ecology
1. What is a population?
In Biology a population is a set of 
individuals of the same species living in 
a given place and in a given time.
2. What is population density?
Population density is the relation 
between the number of individuals of a 
population and the area or volume they 
occupy. For example, in 2001 the 
human population density of the United 
States (according to the World Bank) 
was 29.71 inhabitants per square 
kilometer and China had a population 
density of 135.41 humans per square 
kilometer.
3. What is population growth 
rate?
Population growth rate (PGR) is the 
percent variation between the number 
of individuals in a population at two 
different times. Therefore the population 
growth rate can be positive or negative.
4. How different are the 
concepts of migration, 
emigration and immigration?
Migration is the moving of individuals of 
a species from one place to another. 
Emigration is the migration seen as an 
exit of individuals from one region (to 
another where they will settle 
permanently or temporarily). 
Immigration is the migration seen as 
the settling in one region (permanently 
or temporarily) of individuals coming 
from another region. Therefore 
individuals emigrate "from" and 
immigrate "to".
5. What are the main factors 
that affect the growth of a 
population?
The main factors that make populations 
grow are births and immigration. The 
main factors that make populations 
decrease are deaths and emigration.
6. What are some examples of 
migratory animals?
Examples of migratory animals are: 
southern right whales from Antarctica, 
that procreate on the Brazilian coast; 
migratory salmons that are born in the 
river, go to the sea and return to the 
river to reproduce and die; migratory 
birds from cold regions that spend the 
winter in tropical regions, etc.

Biology Questions and Answers
7. What is biotic potential?
Biotic potential is the capability of 
growth of a given population under 
hypothetical optimum conditions, i.e., in 
an environment without limiting factors 
to such growth. Under such conditions 
the population tends to grow 
indefinitely.
8. What is the typical shape of 
a population growth curve? 
How can the biotic potential 
be represented in the same 
way graphically?
A typical population growth curve 
(number of individuals x time, linear 
scale) has a sigmoidal shape. There is a 
short and slow initial growth followed by 
a fast and longer growth and again a 
decrease in growth preceding the 
stabilization or equilibrium stage.
The population growth according to the 
biotic potential curve however is not 
sigmoidal, it is only crescent-shaped 
and points up to the infinite value of the 
scale (there is neither a decreasing 
stage nor equilibrium).
9. What is environmental 
resistance?
Environmental resistance is the action of 
limiting abiotic and biotic factors that 
disallow the growth of a population as it 
would grow according to its biotic 
potential. Actually each ecosystem is 
able to sustain a limited number of 
individuals of a given species.
The environmental resistance is an 
important concept of population 
ecology.
10. What are the main limiting 
factors for the growth of a 
population?
The factors that limit the growth of a 
population can be divided into biotic 
factors and abiotic factors. The main 
abiotic limiting factors are: availability 
of water and light, availability of shelter. 
The main limiting biotic factors are: 
population density and inharmonious 
(negative) ecological interactions 
(competition, predatism, parasitism, 
ammensalism).
11. How do the availability of 
water and light and the 
climate affect the growth of a 
population?
The availability of water and light and 
the climate are abiotic factors that limit 
the growth of a population. Since the 
producers are responsible for the 
synthesis of organic material transferred 
along the food chains of an ecosystem, 
water and light affect the availability of 
food and a population cannot grow 
beyond the number of individuals the 
environment is able to feed. For 
example, in the desert, the biomass is 
relatively small and populations that live 
in this ecosystem are smaller (compared 
to the same species in environments 
with large available biomass). The 
climate, including the temperature, 
affects the population growth because

Biology Questions and Answers
excessive change in this factor, as the 
occurrence of droughts or floods, may 
cause significant population decline; 
small climatic changes can also alter the 
photosynthesis rate and reduce the 
availability of food in the ecosystem.
12. How do populations of 
predators and prey vary in 
predatism?
Whenever a predator population 
increases at the first moment the prey 
population tends to decrease. At a 
second moment the decrease of the 
prey population and the bigger 
population density of predators cause 
the predator population to decrease. 
The prey population then reverts the 
tendency to decrease and begins to 
grow.
If variations in the size of populations 
occur in an unexpected intensity 
(different from the usual intensity of the 
ecological interaction) for example, due 
to ecological accidents killing many 
prey, the prey-predator equilibrium is 
disturbed and both species can be 
harmed. The existence of the predator 
sometimes is fundamental for the 
survival of the prey population, since 
the absence of predatism favors the 
proliferation of the prey and, in some 
cases, when the excessive proliferation 
creates a population size over the 
sustenance capacity of the ecosystem, 
environmental degradation occurs and 
the entire prey population is destroyed.
13. What is the relationship 
between environmental 
resistance and the population 
growth according to the biotic 
potential curve and the real 
population growth curve?
The difference between the real 
population growth curve (number of 
individuals x time) and the population 
growth according to the biotic potential 
curve of a given population is a result of 
environmental resistance.
14. How different is the 
growth according to the biotic 
potential of a viral population 
from the growth according to 
the biotic potential of a 
bacterial population?
The growth curve according to the biotic 
potential of virus and bacteria both 
present a positive exponential pattern. 
The difference between them is that in 
each time period bacteria double their 
population while the viral population 
multiplies dozens or hundreds of times. 
The viral population growth curve thus 
has more intense growth. This happens 
because bacteria reproduce by binary 
division, each cell generating two 
daughter cells, while each virus 
replicates generating dozens or even 
hundreds of new viruses.
15. What are age pyramids?
Age pyramids are graphical 
representations in form of superposed

rectangles each representing the 
number of individuals included in age 
ranges into which a population is 
divided. Generally the lower age ranges 
are represented more to the bottom of 
the pyramid, always below higher 
ranges, and the variable dimension that 
represents the number of individuals is 
the width (there are age pyramids 
however in which the variable 
dimension is the height).
16. What are the analyses 
provided by the study of 
human age pyramids?
The study of human age pyramids can 
provide the following analyses: 
proportion of individuals at an 
economically active age; proportion of 
elderly (indicating the quality of the 
pension and health systems); proportion 
of children and youth (indicating need 
for job generation and educational 
services); reproductive profile (shows 
the population growth tendency); 
postnatal survival rate (indicates quality 
of the health system, hygiene 
conditions, nutrition and poverty); 
longevity profile; etc.
It is possible to predict whether a 
population belongs to a rich and 
industrialized society or to a poor 
country since the patterns of the age 
pyramids differ according to these 
conditions.
17. What are the main 
characteristics of the age 
pyramids of developed 
countries?
In a stabilized human population the 
age pyramid has a narrower base since 
the reproduction rate is not so high. The 
adult age ranges are generally wider 
than the infantile ranges showing that in 
practice there is no population growth. 
There is a proportionally high number of 
older individuals meaning that the life 
quality is elevated and the population 
has access to health services and good 
nutrition. These are features of the age 
pyramids of developed countries.
18. What is the typical 
conformation of the age 
pyramids of underdeveloped 
countries?
The age pyramids of peripheral 
countries or underdeveloped countries 
have characteristics related to the 
poverty of such populations, with a 
wider base and narrow apex. The base 
age range, if much wider than the other 
levels, indicates a high birth rate. The 
levels just above the base may present 
an impressive reduction in poorer 
populations due to infant mortality. 
Ranges that represent the youth are 
also wide showing future pressure on 
job and habitation needs. The widths of 
the rectangles diminish as age increases 
to the apex that represents the elderly, 
demonstrating difficult life conditions, 
precarious health services and low life 
expectancy.

Biology Questions and Answers
Environmental 
Issues
1. What is pollution?
Pollution is the contamination of an 
ecosystem by factors that are harmful 
for the equilibrium of its biotic or abiotic 
constituents.
2. Is pollution always caused 
by humans?
In most cases pollution is caused by 
human activity. Other species and some 
abiotic factors however can also pollute 
an ecosystem. For example, the red tide 
is created by proliferation of some algae 
and volcanic dust is a consequence of 
the internal activity of the planet.
3. Why is waste considered 
one of the major 
environmental issues?
The environmental problem concerning 
waste worsens with industrial 
development and the global growth of 
consumption societies in the 20th and 
21st centuries, factors that cause the 
immense volume of residuals produced 
by mankind in the last decades. The 
increased waste generation raises the 
issue about what to do with waste since 
nature is not able to degrade and resorb 
with adequate speed and efficiency 
most of the residuals. Therefore the 
various kinds of waste accumulate, 
polluting the environment and creating 
danger to humans and nature. (The 
present destination of waste has been 
public waste depositories where the 
waste volume is compressed and buried 
underground, an environmentally risky 
method. Another method has been 
incineration, with the grave 
consequence of causing air pollution.)
4. What are the main types of 
waste?
The waste can be classified into many 
types, each of them carrying its own 
different environmental problem: 
organic waste, recyclable waste, non 
recyclable waste, toxic waste, nuclear 
toxic waste and space waste.
The organic waste is more easily 
resorbed by nature, but the speed and 
the geographical concentration of its 
production due to urbanization generate 
pollution of rivers, lakes, proliferation of 
disease vectors and environmental 
degradation of towns. The recyclable 
waste is composed of residuals that can 
be reprocessed, used again by humans, 
like plastics and metals; the problem 
regarding recyclable waste is that the 
separation of such material is not 
culturally diffused and there is not 
enough social organization to use them; 
so the recyclable waste is mixed to 
other wastes increasing the volume of 
waste depositories even more. The non 
recyclable waste is formed of residuals 
that technology cannot yet recycle, like 
ceramics, photographic paper, mirrors, 
cigarettes, plasticized papers, etc; this 
kind of waste in the future may become 
recyclable waste and should be

separated. The toxic waste includes 
industrial chemical residuals that are 
harmful for life and the environment, 
like contaminated medical waste and 
the domestic waste containing 
insecticides and medicines; the toxic 
waste is one of the major environmental 
problems since it puts the life of 
humans and other living beings in 
danger. The nuclear toxic waste is made 
of materials that release invisible 
dangerous radiation for many years; 
nuclear toxic waste is produced in the 
extraction of nuclear minerals (like 
uranium), by nuclear reactors and 
nuclear plants, in hospitals where 
Nuclear Medicine is performed and in 
research centers; although the nuclear 
waste is often put into armored 
receptacles the risk of accidents is 
permanent. Space waste is the waste 
produced by the activity of humans in 
space from the second half of the 20th 
century; it consists of non operating 
satellites, rocket piece and other 
equipments that remain orbiting the 
earth or other celestial bodies or even 
travelling across space.
Environmental Issues: organic waste 
recyclable waste non recyclable waste 
toxic waste nuclear toxic waste
5. What is selective waste 
collection?
Recyclable waste is waste that can be 
reprocessed and used again. Waste 
recycling depends on the separation of 
the recyclable residuals from non 
recyclable ones and on the classification 
of the recyclable into plastics, metals, 
papers, etc. The function of the 
selective waste collection is to simplify 
that separation for the waste to be 
sorted at the point of origin. Selective 
collection also helps the creation of an 
environmental conscience in the people 
that produce the waste.
6. What is the cost-benefit 
relationship regarding sewage 
treatment as a strategy to 
fight water pollution?
To treat sewage is much cheaper for 
society. The non treated sewage 
pollutes rivers, lakes and the sea, being 
a cause of diseases transmitted through 
water. For the society the costs of these 
diseases are much higher than the cost 
of the sewage treatment.
One of the most economical systems to 
treat sewage is the aerobic treatment 
system, reservoirs kept very 
oxygenated for aerobic bacteria to 
decompose organic material.
7. What is eutrophication?
Eutrophication is the process of 
excessive increasing of nutrients, like 
phosphate and nitrate, in water due to 
direct deposit of non treated sewage. 
The nutrients act as fertilizers leading to 
abnormal proliferation of aquatic algae. 
With the exaggerated growth of the alga 
population the number of aerobic 
bacteria that cause decomposition of 
organic material also increases. The 
proliferation of these bacteria depletes 
the dissolved oxygen killing fishes and 
other animals. Besides, the lack of 
oxygen causes the decomposition to be 
assumed by anaerobic bacteria.

Biology Questions and Answers
hydrogen sulfide that makes water 
improper to other living beings and 
creates a putrid smell.
8. What is a biodigester?
A biodigester is equipment that 
produces carbon dioxide, hydrogen 
sulfide and fuel gases (biogases) like 
methane from organic material under 
decomposition (dung, food waste, sugar 
cane waste, etc.). The biogas is used in 
heating, as energy for motors and 
machines and it even has industrial 
uses. Biodigesters are widely used in 
public waste depositories and in rural 
areas. Besides producing biogas the 
organic waste can be turned into good 
quality fertilizer.
9. What are the environmental 
harms caused by mercury 
pollution? What are the main 
sources of mercury pollution?
Mercury is a metal that when present in 
the water of rivers, lakes and seas 
contaminates fishes, crustaceans, 
molluscs and other living beings. The 
mercury accumulates along the food 
chain and in each following trophic level 
the amount of the metal within the 
individuals is higher. When humans eat 
contaminated animals they also become 
contaminated and severe nervous 
system injuries may emerge. The main 
sources of mercury pollution are gold 
mining and the use of derived 
substances in industry and agriculture.
10. Besides mercury which 
other heavy metals cause 
toxic pollution?
Examples of other heavy metals that 
cause toxic pollution are lead, cadmium 
and chromium.
11. What are persistent 
organic pollutants (POPs?
POPs, or persistent organic pollutants, 
are toxic substances formed from 
organic compounds. POPs are made in 
several industrial processes, like the 
production of PVC, paper whitened by 
chlorine, herbicides, insecticides and 
fungicides, and also in the incineration 
of waste. Examples of POPs are dioxins, 
furanes, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, 
heptachloride, toxaphen and 
hexachlorbenzene.
POPs are toxic and highly harmful since, 
like the heavy metals, they are 
bioaccumulative, i.e., they are not 
degraded by the body and accumulate 
even more in each following trophic 
level of the food chains. In humans 
POPs can cause cancer and nervous, 
immune and reproductive impairments.
12. Is the upward move of 
warm air good or bad for the 
dispersion of pollutants?
The upward movement of warm air is a 
natural method of dispersion of 
pollutants. The air near the ground is 
hotter because the sun heats the soil 
and the soil heats the air nearby. Since

Biology Questions and Answers
it is less dense, the warm air tends to 
move towards higher and colder strata 
of the atmosphere. Such movement 
helps the dispersion of pollutants.
13. Does thermal inversion 
occur in the winter or in the 
summer?
Pollutant low altitude thermal inversion 
occurs in the winter. In this period of 
the year the sun heats the soil less and 
the natural upward move of warm air 
decreases. Therefore the pollutants 
form a low altitude layer between the 
cold air layer near the ground and 
another layer of warmer air above. The 
pollutant layer over industrial areas or 
big urban concentrations reduces the 
penetration of the sun's energy and the 
air bellow takes an even longer time to 
warm.
14. Why does thermal 
inversion increases air 
pollution? What harm can 
thermal inversion cause to 
humans?
Thermal inversion confines at low 
altitude a layer of pollutants that would 
have been dispersed by the natural 
upward move of warm air. The solid 
particles present in the atmosphere 
cause health problems, like the 
exacerbation of asthma and other 
pulmonary diseases, cough, respiratory 
unease and ocular discharges; later the 
pollution can also trigger the 
appearance of cardiovascular and 
neoplastic diseases.
15. What is the role of the 
ozone layer for living beings?
Ozone, O3, is a gas of the atmosphere 
that filters ultraviolet radiation from the 
sun disallowing most of that radiation 
from reaching the surface of the planet. 
Ultraviolet radiation is harmful for living 
beings because it is a mutagen and can 
cause cancer (mainly skin cancer), other 
DNA mutations and even burns.
16. What are the main 
chemical compounds that 
destroy the ozone layer?
The mains chemical compounds that 
destroy the ozone layer are the CFCs, 
chlorofluorocarbons, or freons, 
substances used in the past in 
refrigerators, airconditioners and spray 
cans.
Chlorofluorocarbons react with ozone in 
the high atmosphere releasing 
molecular oxygen and therefore the 
amount of ozone in the atmosphere is 
reduced.
Another substance that destroys the 
ozone layer is methyl bromide, used in 
agricultural insecticides.
17. What is nuclear pollution?
Nuclear pollution consists of radiations 
emitted from atomic nuclei, these 
radiations are highly injurious to living 
beings. They can be originated from the 
extraction of radioactive minerals, 
nuclear plant reactors, nuclear research

centers, hospitals and medical centers 
that use radioisotopes, nuclear bomb 
explosions or accidents with 
transportation, handling or storage of 
nuclear material. Nuclear materials 
remain dangerous for many years, 
contaminating the environment with 
radiation that can cause cancer, 
immune impairment, congenital 
deficiencies, burns and even death. The 
damage is proportional to the intensity 
of the exposition to the radiation.
Its persistent feature and high 
aggression power make nuclear 
pollution one of the major 
environmental problems of our time.
18. What is plutonium 
reprocessing? Why is it a big 
environmental issue?
Plutonium is the highly radioactive 
chemical element produced from 
uranium by nuclear plants. Plutonium 
can be reprocessed to be used again in 
nuclear plants or in other destinations, 
like the making of nuclear bombs. 
Plutonium reprocessing nowadays, 
however, is done only in some countries 
like France, Russia and Britain. The 
countries that have nuclear plants, like 
Japan, Australia, etc., send their atomic 
waste by ship to those plutonium 
reprocessing centers. Besides the 
inherent risks of the storage of nuclear 
waste, plutonium reprocessing brings 
the risks of the transport of radioactive 
material across the oceans. The 
“nuclear ships” often travel near the 
coast of many countries posing danger 
to their populations.
19. What is transgenic food?
Transgenic beings are animals, 
microorganisms and plants that contain 
recombinant DNA, i.e., genes from 
other plants, microorganisms or animals 
artificially inserted into their genetic 
material. Transgenic beings are made 
for scientific and economic purposes, in 
this last case with the intention of 
improving their commercial features. 
For example, bacteria that produce 
human insulin are transgenic beings 
made by biotechnology. The main 
targets of the transgenic technology are 
edible vegetables, like soy, corn, potato 
and tomato.
20. Why are transgenics 
considered a threat to the 
environmental safety?
Transgenics can be dangerous to the 
entire biosphere since the transfer of 
genes between species may have 
immediate and long term unpredictable 
consequences. The creation of new 
species by nature is a slow process, 
dependent on causal mutations and 
natural selection, a relatively safe 
process for the ecological equilibrium. It 
is impossible to know how the fast and 
artificial introduction of transgenic 
beings in nature affects ecosystems. 
Pathogenic agents may be involuntarily 
created in laboratories, spreading 
unknown diseases; transgenic species 
may uncontrollably proliferate 
destroying ecological interactions that 
have taken thousands of years to be 
established; the ingestion of transgenic 
food also has unpredictable effects.

Biology Questions and Answers
21. What is biological control?
Biological control is a natural method to 
control the size of animal, 
microorganism or plant populations. 
Biological control is based on the 
knowledge of inharmonious (negative) 
ecological interactions between species. 
Using such knowledge a parasite, 
competitor or predator species is 
introduced in an ecosystem in order to 
attain reduction of the population of 
another species with which it has 
inharmonious ecological interaction. The 
biological control presents the 
advantage of substituting the use of 
pesticides and other toxic chemical 
products in the control of plagues and 
diseases. It however should be 
employed with caution under serious 
previous study to avoid harmful 
ecological disequilibrium.
A kind of biological control of some 
species can be done by the introduction 
of previously sterilized males, that do 
not generate offspring.
22. What is bioremediation?
Bioremediation is the use of 
microorganisms, like bacteria, protists 
and fungi, to degrade noxious 
substances turning them into non toxic 
or less toxic substances. Bioremediation 
employs microorganisms whose 
metabolism uses contaminants as 
reagents.
Bioremediation is used, for example, in 
the decontamination of environments 
polluted by oil spills. In this process 
bacteria that use hydrocarbons as 
substrate for their cellular respiration 
are employed.
23. What is global warming?
Global warming is the increase in the 
temperature of the planet due to 
accumulation of some gases in the 
atmosphere, especially gases that retain 
the solar energy reflected by the planet 
surface. The main gas that causes the 
global warming is carbon dioxide, CO2, 
but other gases act as “warming gases” 
too, like methane, CH4, and nitrous 
oxide, N2O. The exaggerated increase of 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has 
been caused by the burning of fossil 
fuels (mainly oil and coal) in industrial 
and urban societies and by forest fires. 
(It is important to note that the natural 
warming provided by gases of the 
atmosphere is fundamental for the 
maintenance of the planet 
temperature.)
Predictions of studies sponsored by the 
United Nations stated that the global 
warming may cause life-threatening 
transformations to the planet in the 
near future. Countries that are the 
biggest emitters of carbon dioxide, like 
the United States and China, however, 
systematically ignore the warnings and 
continue to largely contribute to the 
danger.
Global warming is one of the most 
polemic environmental issues today.

Biology Questions and Answers
Concepts of 
Parasitism
1. What is parasitism?
Parasitism is an inharmonious 
interspecific ecological interaction in 
which individuals of a species (the 
parasites) explore organs, tissues or 
cells of individuals of another species 
(the hosts) causing harm to these.
2. What is the difference 
between ectoparasite and 
endoparasite?
Ectoparasites are parasites that explore 
the external surface of the host (like, for 
example, mites that parasite the skin). 
Endoparasites are parasites that live 
within the body of the host (like the 
taenias).
3. Concerning the number of 
hosts how are parasites 
classified?
Parasites that require only one host are 
called monoxenous parasites. Parasites 
that need more than one host for their 
life cycle are called heteroxenous 
parasites.
4. What is the criterion used 
to classify hosts as 
intermediate hosts or as 
definitive hosts?
The criterion used to classify hosts as 
intermediate hosts or as definitive hosts 
is the kind of reproduction of the 
parasite, sexual or asexual, within the 
host. The host within which the sexual 
reproduction stage of the parasite 
occurs is the definitive host. The host 
within which the asexual reproduction 
stage of the parasite occurs is the 
intermediate host.
5. What are vectors of 
parasites?
Vectors of a parasite are organisms able 
to transport the parasite during stages 
of its life cycle mediating the infection of 
other hosts. For example, the mosquito 
Aedes aegypti is the vector of the 
dengue virus; triatomine bugs are 
vectors of the Trypanosoma cruzi, 
protozoan that causes Chagas’ disease; 
mice are vectors of leptospira, bacteria 
that cause leptospirosis.
6. What is an etiological agent 
of disease?
An etiological agent of disease is the 
agent that causes the disease. It may 
be a living being, substance or 
environmental fact.

between the concepts of 
epidemic disease and endemic 
disease?
Endemic diseases are those that often 
affect people of a given place, many or 
few individuals. Epidemic diseases are 
those of rapid spread and elevated 
number of new cases. An endemic 
disease can turn into an epidemic 
disease.

Biology Questions and Answers
Bacterial Infections
1. What are some human 
diseases caused by bacteria 
and what are their respective 
modes of transmission?
The main human bacterial infections 
transmitted by respiratory secretions 
(sneezes, cough) and saliva drops are: 
bacterial pneumonias, tuberculosis, 
whooping cough (pertussis), diphtheria, 
bacterial meningitis. Main bacterial 
diseases transmitted by blood or sexual 
contact are: gonorrhea, syphilis. Main 
bacterial diseases transmitted by animal 
vectors are: bubonic plague, endemic 
typhus, leptospirosis. Some bacterial 
diseases transmitted through fecal-oral 
route and contaminated food are: 
cholera, typhoid fever. Other important 
bacterial infections: Hansen's disease, 
possibly transmitted by saliva drops and 
contact with injured skin and mucosae; 
trachoma, eye disease transmitted by 
ocular secretions; tetanus, transmitted 
when the etiological agent enters the 
body through skin wounds.
2. What is tuberculosis? How 
is the disease transmitted? Is 
there treatment for 
tuberculosis?
Tuberculosis is a disease caused by the 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, bacteria 
which attack other organs of the body 
but mainly the lungs leading to 
respiratory insufficiency. Before 1940, 
tuberculosis had already been one of 
the main causes of death in the USA 
and Europe. The disease can remain 
latent, without manifestation for several 
years and even throughout the life.
Tuberculosis is highly contagious, 
transmitted by air route through 
sneezes and coughs from a person with 
the active disease. Transmission is 
common between members of the same 
family or even in work environments. 
The disease today has treatment with 
efficient antibiotics. Generally, the 
patient receives three different drugs for 
several months until healing is 
complete. There are however some 
strains of multiresistant TB bacteria that 
emerged by mutation and natural 
selection due to the intense use of 
antibiotic drugs mainly in hospitals and 
treatment facilities; in these cases the 
treatment is more difficult.
3. Is there vaccine against 
tuberculosis?
The vaccine against tuberculosis is 
called BCG (bacillus Calmette-Guérin). 
BCG is not used in some countries 
where tuberculosis is not so prevalent 
because it can distort later diagnostic 
studies of the disease; in other 
countries, like Brazil, it is obligatory for 
children. The vaccine is made of 
attenuated TB bacteria.

Biology Questions and Answers
4. Are all pneumonias caused 
by bacteria?
Pneumonia is the generic name of 
inflammation of the lungs. Besides 
bacterial pneumonias, there are 
pneumonias caused by virus, fungi, 
toxic pneumonias, etc.
5. What is Hansen’s disease 
(etiological agent, mode of 
transmission, clinical 
manifestations and 
prevention)?
The etiological agent of Hansen’s 
disease is bacteria called Mycobacterium 
leprae. The mode of transmission is not 
yet totally known but it is believed that 
respiratory secretions and saliva drops 
can spread the disease. Hansen’s 
disease is a chronic disease (slow 
progression) that generally attacks the 
skin and the peripheral nerves although 
other areas of the body can be affected. 
In the skin nodules, reddish spots, 
thickening of the dermis and lack of 
sensitivity appear; the mucosae, 
especially the nasal mucosa, may be 
injured and also the viscera may be 
affected. The main form of prevention is 
information, since there is available 
treatment; infected people should, as 
soon as possible, look for health 
services for evaluation and treatment of 
the disease.
In the past Hansen’s disease was called 
leprosy.
6. What is the etiological 
agent and the main 
manifestations of cholera?
Cholera is a bacterial disease caused by 
the Vibrio cholerae. The disease is 
transmitted by fecal-oral route and the 
main mode of transmission is ingestion 
of contaminated water or food. It is 
most prevalent in places that lack 
adequate sanitary conditions.
Inside the human gut the cholera 
vibrion releases toxins called 
enterotoxins. The infection can cause 
intense diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration 
and even death in more severe cases.
7. What is meningitis?
Meningitis is the generic name given to 
inflammation of the meninges, 
membranes that cover the central 
nervous system. Meningitis can have 
several causes (infectious, toxic, 
traumatic, neoplastic infestation, 
autoimmune). Bacterial infections 
caused by meningococcus, haemophilus, 
pneumococcus or by tuberculosis 
bacteria are severe and contagious.
The main symptoms of bacterial 
meningitis are high fever, nuchal 
rigidity, intense headache, vomiting and 
sometimes convulsions. The disease 
should be treated with antibiotics.
8. What is syphilis?
Syphilis, also known as lues, is a 
disease caused by the bacteria 
Treponema pallidum. Before the

Biology Questions and Answers
discovery of penicillin, syphilis was a 
fatal disease. Today the use of 
antibiotics can cure the disease 
completely. Patients with primary 
syphilis present a single and painless 
wound in the skin, sometimes called 
chancre, in the region where the 
treponema has penetrated; the chancre 
is highly infective. Syphilis is one of the 
main STDs, sexually transmitted 
diseases. Generally the chancre 
develops in the penis, vagina, anus, 
hands or mouth, and the bacteria is 
often transmitted by sexual contact. 
Later syphilis develops into systemic 
diseases, secondary and tertiary 
syphilis.
Syphilis can also be transmitted by 
blood transfusions, accidents with 
contaminated objects and vertically 
from the mother to the child (congenital 
syphilis). It is very important for 
patients with the disease to seek 
treatment as soon as possible and to 
undergo tests to look for other STDs, 
like HPV and HIV infections.
9. What is an antibiogram?
Antibiogram is a laboratory test 
intended to guide the choice of 
adequate antibiotic to treat a given 
bacterial infection. In the antibiogram 
cultures of bacteria obtained from 
tissues contaminated by the infection 
under study are submitted to the action 
of different antibiotics. After some time 
it is verified which of the antibiotics 
were successful in interrupting the 
bacterial growth or in killing the 
bacterial population.
The antibiogram is very important to 
avoid exaggerated and inefficient use of 
antibiotics and the emergence of 
multiresistant bacteria.

Biology Questions and Answers
Protozoan 
Diseases
1. Which is the kingdom of the 
parasites that cause malaria 
and Chagas’ disease?
Those diseases are caused by the 
protozoans, beings of the kingdom 
Protista.
2. What is the scientific name 
of the etiological agent of 
Chagas’ disease?
The etiological agent of Chagas’ disease 
is the Trypanosoma cruzi. The name 
“cruzi” was given in honor of the 
Brazilian doctor Oswaldo Cruz. The 
disease was named after the Brazilian 
doctor Carlos Chagas.
3. Under which forms is the 
Trypanosoma cruzi found in 
its hosts?
In the definitive hosts as well as in 
triatomine bugs (intermediate hosts) 
the protozoan that causes Chagas’ 
disease alternates mastigote (flagellate) 
and amastigote forms and also 
intermediate forms between these 
forms.
4. What is the vector of 
Chagas’ disease? How is the 
disease transmitted?
The vector of Chagas’ disease is its 
intermediate host, a triatomine bug. The 
main species is Triatoma infestans.
Hemipteran insects, like triatiomines, 
have sucking mouthparts that can be 
used to suck blood from animals or 
organic fluids from plants. The vectors 
of Chagas’ disease are hematophagous 
hemipterans that have nocturnal habits. 
The blood-sucking bugs become 
infected when they bite a contaminated 
person. The parasites then multiply 
within the bug gut and are eliminated 
with its feces. When a contaminated 
triatomine bites another person it 
defecates near the bite site and the 
released protozoans can penetrate into 
the definitive host through mucosae or 
through the bite wound. Wild and 
domestic mammals can also be vessels 
for the disease.
5. What is the life cycle of 
Trypanosoma cruzi?
Trypanosoma cruzi is a heteroxenous 
parasite, i.e., it has an intermediate 
host, the triatomine bug, and a 
definitive host, the human. The 
triatomine bug becomes infected by 
sucking the blood of a contaminated 
person. Within the bug gut the 
protozoan reproduces itself. When the 
triatomine bites another person it 
defecates near the bite site. Generally 
the bitten person itches the area of the 
bite and the parasite gains the 
circulation of the definitive host. Within

humans the Trypanosoma cruzi multiply 
as amastigote form in the cardiac 
muscle tissue or in the nervous tissue 
forming pseudocysts. These 
pseudocysts break releasing flagellate 
parasites into the circulation and the 
cycle is repeated.
6. What is the incubation 
period of an infection?
Incubation period is the time interval 
between the infection by an agent that 
causes disease and the first signs or 
symptoms of the disease.
7. What is the average 
incubation period of Chagas’ 
disease? What are some signs 
and symptoms of the acute 
phase of Chagas’ disease?
Chagas’ disease may or may not 
present an acute phase. When it is 
present, the incubation period is about 5 
to 14 days. The chronic phase, however, 
can manifest in more than 10 years 
after the infection.
At the site where the trypanosoma has 
penetrated the skin or the mucosa 
becomes swelled: This sign is known as 
chagoma. Another sign that may appear 
in up to 20% of cases after the infection 
is the Romana’s sign, a swelling of one 
of the eyelids when infection took place 
through the ocular route. In the acute 
Chagas’ disease fever, malaise, 
inflammation and enlargement of lymph 
nodes may occur. In more severe cases 
fatal inflammation of the cardiac muscle 
or of the meninges may happen.
8. In the long term which are 
the organs affected by chronic 
Chagas’ disease?
In the chronic phase of Chagas’ disease, 
that manifests years after the infection, 
the trypanosoma infests the muscles of 
the heart causing insufficient blood 
pumping, pulmonary edema and 
increase in the size of the organ 
(cardiomegaly). This is the cardiac 
manifestation of Chagas’ disease. The 
main symptoms that appear are 
dyspnea, cough and cardiac 
arrhythmias.
In the digestive form of manifestation of 
the disease the parasite destroys cells 
of the autonomic nervous system 
responsible for the peristaltism of the 
digestive tube. Since the motility of the 
esophagus and intestines is reduced the 
transit of materials inside these organs 
is impaired and they increase in size 
(width), conditions respectively known 
as megaesophagus and megacolon. The 
main symptoms are dysphagia 
(impaired swallowing), constipation, 
flatulence and formation of fecaloma 
(accumulation of feces inside the 
bowels).
9. What is prophylaxis?
Prophylaxis are measures taken to 
prevent diseases. For example, the use 
of condoms in sexual relations is a 
prophylaxis against contamination by

agents that cause STDs (sexually 
transmitted diseases).
10. What are the etiological 
agents of malaria?
The etiological agents of malaria are 
protozoans of the genus Plasmodium. 
There are four different types of 
plasmodia that cause malaria: 
Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium 
vivax, Plasmodium falciparum and 
Plasmodium ovale.
11. What are the human 
tissues affected by malaria? 
What are the main clinical 
manifestations of the disease?
The plasmodium infects the human 
blood causing destruction of red blood 
cells and it also affects the liver. Malaria 
characterizes by periodical episodes of 
fever, chills and sweating that can be 
accompanied by headache, nausea, 
vomiting and jaundice. The destruction 
of red blood cells may lead to anemia 
and hypoxemia.
The infection by Plasmodium falciparum 
if not treated can cause other 
complications and even death.
12. What is the vector of 
malaria? How different is its 
behavior from the behavior of 
the vector of dengue fever?
The vector of malaria is a mosquito of 
the genus Anopheles, also called 
anopheline. In opposition to the 
mosquito vector of the dengue fever, 
the anopheline has nocturnal habits.
13. What are the intermediate 
and the definitive hosts of the 
plasmodium?
In the life cycle of the plasmodium 
humans are the intermediate hosts 
(where asexual reproduction takes 
place) and the vector mosquito is the 
definitive host (where sexual 
reproduction occurs).
14. What is the life cycle of 
Plasmodium vivax?
The vector mosquito bites a 
contaminated person and ingests female 
and male gametocytes of the parasite. 
Within the insect gut the gametocytes 
differentiate into gametes and 
fecundation occurs, forming zygotes. 
Each plasmodium zygote by mitosis 
(sporogony) generates numerous 
infective sporozoites that migrate to the 
salivary glands of the mosquito. When 
the mosquito bites a person the 
sporozoites enter the human circulation 
and when in the liver they undergo the 
first asexual reproduction (tissue 
schizogony), releasing several 
merozoites into the blood. The

Biology Questions and Answers
merozoites infect red blood cells where 
the second asexual reproduction of the 
cycle (erythrocytic schizogony) and the 
production of many other parasites 
occur; some of these parasites 
differentiate into gametocytes. The red 
blood cells then break (hemolysis), the 
parasites are released in the blood and 
the cycle can restart.
15. To which phase of the 
plasmodium life cycle do the 
typical chills and fever of 
malaria correspond?
The typical chills and fever episodes of 
malaria correspond to the phase when 
red blood cells are destroyed after the 
erythrocytic schizogony of the 
plasmodium life cycle.
16. What are the main 
prophylactic measures against 
malaria?
The main preventive measures against 
malaria are the elimination of the vector 
mosquito, treatment of infected people, 
avoidance of the mosquito bite, 
information for travelers to endemic 
areas and the use of preventive 
medicines.
17. What are other important 
human diseases caused by 
protozoans?
Some other important protozoan 
infections are amebiasis, giardiasis, 
trichomoniasis, leishmaniasis, 
toxoplasmosis and meningoencephalitis 
by free-living amoebas.
18. What is the etiological 
agent of amebiasis? How is it 
transmitted and what are the 
typical manifestations of the 
disease?
Amebiasis is caused by the protozoan 
Entamoeba histolytica, or simply 
amoeba.
The transmission of the disease is oral-
fecal, through contaminated water and 
food or by insects like cockroaches and 
flies. The amoeba parasites the intestine 
of humans generally in an 
asymptomatic manner, but it can 
sometimes cause enteritis with diarrhea 
and severe dysentery, abdominal pain, 
weight loss and anemia. In rare cases 
extra-intestinal invasion may occur 
affecting the liver, skin, genital organs 
and other organs.
19. What is the parasite that 
causes giardiasis? How is it 
transmitted and what are the 
typical manifestations of the 
disease?
Giardiasis is a protozoal infection caused 
by Giardia lamblia, or simply giardia, a 
flagellate protozoan.
The transmission is fecal-oral, through 
contaminated water and food or carried 
by insects like cockroaches and flies. 
Giardiasis manifests like amebiasis, as

an enteritis with diarrhea, abdominal 
pain, weight loss and anemia.
20. What is trichomoniasis? 
Why is it classified as an STD?
Trichomoniasis is an extra-intestinal 
protozoan infection caused by 
Trichomonas vaginalis, a flagellate 
protozoan. The parasite infects the 
urinary tract of males and females. In 
females it causes discharge, pain and 
itching.
Trichomoniasis is an STD because its 
main mode of transmission is sexual 
contact.
21. What are the main 
manifestations of 
leishmaniasis?
There are two main forms of 
leishmaniasis: cutaneous leishmaniasis 
and visceral leishmaniasis (also known 
as kala-azar). The form is determined 
by the species of infective leishmania 
and by the immune response of the 
host.
22. What is the etiological 
agent of cutaneous 
leishmaniasis? How is the 
disease transmitted and what 
are its typical manifestations?
The etiological agent of cutaneous 
leishmaniasis is the protozoan 
Leishmania braziliensis.
The transmission, like in the visceral 
form of the disease, is by the bite of the 
sand fly Lutzomya (named after the 
Brazilian scientist Adolfo Lutz), the 
vector host. Cutaneous leshmaniasis 
develops in the bite site where the 
parasite establishes itself. The skin 
wound has a volcanic crater shape, a 
reddish injury with elevated borders. 
From the primary lesions the parasites 
can spread through the blood to affect 
other areas, mainly the mucosae of the 
nose, mouth and pharynx, causing facial 
deformations.
23. What is the etiological 
agent of visceral 
leishmaniasis? How is the 
disease transmitted and what 
are its typical manifestations?
Visceral leishmaniasis is caused by the 
protozoan Leishmania donovani.
The transmission is similar to the 
cutaneous leishmaniasis, by the bite of 
sand flies. The affected organs generally 
are the liver, the spleen and the bone 
marrow. The patient often has fever, 
weight loss, splenomegaly (hypertrophy 
of the spleen), anemia and decreased 
counts of leukocytes and platelets. The 
disease may cause death.

24. What is the parasite that 
causes toxoplasmosis? How is 
the disease transmitted and 
what are its typical 
manifestations?
Toxoplasmosis is caused by the 
protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, a 
sporozoan.
Toxoplasmosis is a disease transmitted 
by cats, which are the definitive hosts of 
the parasite. Cats eliminate toxoplasma 
oocysts in feces; the oocysts are 
extremely resistant and remain viable 
for months in the environment. Human 
beings are infected when ingesting 
water or food contaminated by oocysts 
or when making contact with 
contaminated objects. Humans can also 
become infected by eating meat of 
animals like pork, cow and sheep, which 
can be intermediate hosts too. Vertical 
transmission, from mother to offspring, 
may also occur.
In toxoplasmosis the cystic form of the 
parasite invades tissues of the body, 
including the brain and the retina. The 
infestation is potentially fatal. In 
congenital toxoplasmosis the child may 
present blindness and mental 
retardation. The disease is especially 
severe when occurring as an 
opportunistic disease in AIDS patients.

Biology Questions and Answers
Fungal Infections
1. What are the main human 
diseases caused by fungi?
The main human diseases caused by 
fungi in immunocompetent patients are 
coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, 
blastomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, 
or South American blastomycosis, 
sporotrichosis and onychomycosis (nail 
mycosis).
In immuno-deficient patients, besides 
the diseases mentioned above, other 
fungal diseases like systemic 
candidiasis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis 
and other opportunistic diseases can 
occur.
2. Moniliasis is one of the 
most common opportunistic 
diseases in AIDS. What is the 
etiological agent of moniliasis 
and what is the other name of 
the disease? Why is monilia 
also common in healthy 
newborns?
The etiological agent of moniliasis is 
Candida albicans, a fungus. Moniliasis is 
also known as mucocutaneous 
candidiasis. In AIDS moniliasis can 
complicate and turn into systemic 
candidiasis, affecting many organs.
Newborns do not yet have their immune 
system working with complete efficiency 
and thus they are more susceptible to 
candidiasis that generally appears in 
mouth and in the genital mucosae and 
disappears naturally.
3. What are some fungal 
diseases transmitted by 
animal feces?
Bat and pigeon feces can carry 
Histoplasma capsulatum, the fungus 
agent of histoplasmosis. The infection is 
transmitted through inhalation of 
contaminated dust in places visited by 
these animals (caves, tunnels, squares, 
roofs, etc.). Cryptococcosis is another 
fungal disease transmitted by pigeon 
excrement.
4. What are some antibiotics 
used against fungi?
The topical or systemic azoles (like 
itraconazole, fluconazole and others), 
amphotericin B, the echinocandins 
(caspofungin, micafungin), terbinafine 
and griseofulvin are examples of 
antifungal drugs.

Biology Questions and Answers
Viral Infections
1. What are some human 
diseases caused by virus and 
what are their respective 
modes of transmission?
The main viral diseases transmitted by 
respiratory secretions (sneezes, cough) 
and by saliva drops are flu, mumps, 
smallpox (variola, already considered 
eradicated), rubella, measles, SARS. 
Main viral diseases transmitted through 
blood or sexual contact are AIDS, 
hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HPV, ebola 
hemorrhagic fever. Main viral diseases 
transmitted by animal vectors are 
rabies, dengue fever, yellow fever. 
Some viral diseases transmitted by 
fecal-oral route, including contaminated 
food, are hepatitis A, poliomyelitis 
(disease almost eradicated in many 
parts of the world).
2. What is the virus that 
causes flu? Why doesn't the 
body produce permanent 
immunity against that virus? 
How does the vaccine against 
flu work?
Flu is a disease caused by the influenza 
virus, a highly mutant DNA virus. Due 
to the high mutation rate of the virus, 
that forms many different strains, flu 
always presents epidemic features in 
affected populations and people may 
have several flu episodes during life 
(the immune response made from 
previous infections is not efficient in 
future infections).
The vaccine against flu is a vaccine 
made of attenuated virus of three 
different strains. Each year the WHO 
(World Health Organization) researches 
and determines which are the strains 
that should compose the vaccine. This is 
a strategy to face the high mutation 
rate of the virus.
3. Why is rubella during 
gestation a threat to the 
fetus?
If occurring during gestation rubella is a 
dangerous disease because the virus 
crosses the placenta and contaminates 
the fetus. The fetus then develops 
congenital rubella, a teratogenic (cause 
of malformations) disease.
Congenital rubella may be prevented by 
vaccination. Doctor must always be 
consulted before vaccination.
4. What are the main available 
vaccines against 
poliomyelitis?
The vaccines used against poliomyelitis 
are the Sabin vaccine and the Salk 
vaccine. The Sabin vaccine contains 
attenuated virus and is taken through 
oral drops. The Salk vaccine is made of 
dead virus and is administered by 
injection.

Biology Questions and Answers
5. Is rabies caused by virus or 
by bacteria? How is it 
transmitted? Which organs 
and tissues are affected by the 
disease? How is it prevented 
and treated?
Rabies, also known as hydrophobia, is a 
viral disease. It is found in dogs, cats, 
bats and other wild mammals. The 
transmission to humans occurs through 
the saliva of contaminated animals, 
mainly through bites.
The rabies virus is neurotropic and 
attacks the central nervous system in a 
fast and lethal fashion. The prevention 
of the disease is done by prophylactic 
vaccination of animals and humans. The 
treatment is done by anti-rabies serum 
containing specific antibodies against 
the virus.
6. What is the difference 
between smallpox (variola) 
and measles?
Smallpox is a viral infection like 
measles. Smallpox is transmitted by 
respiratory secretions, saliva and 
objects in contact with contaminated 
patients. The disease is characterized by 
the appearance of numerous vesicles on 
the skin of the face, trunk and limbs, 
that can suppurate and form crusts; 
smallpox complications can lead to 
death. Measles is transmitted by saliva 
drops and respiratory secretions too. It 
is characterized by exanthems (red 
spots on the skin), fever, malaise and 
lymphadenomegaly (enlarged 
lymphnodes). If not treated measles 
complications can cause death.
Smallpox killed thousands of people 
around the world in the end of the 19th 
century and the beginning of the 20th 
century but today it is almost eradicated 
by vaccination. Nowadays however a 
great fear is the possibility of use of 
smallpox virus in biological weapons and 
by bioterrorists. Measles is not 
eradicated and affects millions of people 
each year. Both diseases can be 
prevented by vaccination.
7. What are the three main 
types of viral hepatitis?
There are many types of viral hepatitis. 
The most important epidemiologically 
are hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis 
C.
8. What are the modes of 
transmission, main signs and 
symptoms and treatments of 
hepatitis A?
Hepatitis A is an acute disease of low 
mortality caused by the hepatitis A virus 
(an RNA virus). It is transmitted by 
fecal-oral route often through 
contamination of foods like vegetables 
and sea-food. The virus attacks the liver 
and its incubation period varies between 
15 and 45 days. After incubation the 
symptoms are fever, headache, 
abdominal pain, malaise, nausea and 
vomiting and the main signs are 
jaundice, hepatomegaly (enlargement of 
the liver) and darkened urine (due to 
excessive bile in blood). Blood tests 
show increased levels of hepatic 
enzymes caused by injuries to liver

cells. Hepatitis A often heals naturally 
after 4 to 6 weeks.
9. What are the modes of 
transmission, main signs and 
symptoms and treatments of 
hepatitis B?
Hepatitis B is a disease caused by a 
DNA virus. The transmission is by blood 
(wounds, sexual relations, transfusions, 
accidents with contaminated material, 
etc.). The most common form of the 
disease is chronic, the infected patient 
carries the virus for life and the liver 
gradually suffers injuries that can lead 
to cirrhosis or even to hepatic cancer. 
Another form of the disease is acute, 
sometimes fulminating, with symptoms 
similar to those of hepatitis A but more 
severe and sometimes lethal. There are 
persons that are asymptomatic carriers 
of the virus. The level of hepatic injury 
is assessed by blood tests of hepatic 
enzymes and by hepatic biopsy 
(extraction of small samples of tissue to 
be examined under the microscope). 
Viral replication can be estimated 
through PCR (polymerase chain 
reaction).
10. What are the modes of 
transmission, main signs and 
symptoms and treatments of 
hepatitis C?
Hepatitis C is caused by an RNA virus 
and transmitted through blood (like 
hepatitis B, through wounds, sexual 
relations, transfusions, accidents with 
contaminated material, etc.). The usual 
manifestation is chronic and many 
people that have the virus are 
asymptomatic. The liver gradually 
undergoes injuries and some patients 
evolve to cirrhosis, hepatic cancer and 
death. Today interferon use is an 
attempt to control replication of the 
hepatitis C virus. The assessment of the 
disease is made periodically by hepatic 
biopsy and by blood tests of hepatic 
enzymes. Viral replication can be 
estimated through PCR (polymerase 
chain reaction).
11. Are there non viral 
hepatitides?
Hepatitis is a generic name for 
inflammation of the liver. There are 
bacterial hepatitides, for example, in 
lepstopirosis, and toxic hepatitides, for 
example by alcohol, medicines or 
inhaled chemical products.
12. What are the main human 
viral diseases transmitted by 
mosquitoes?
The main human viral infections 
transmitted by mosquitoes are dengue 
fever and yellow fever.
13. What is dengue?
Dengue, or dengue fever, is an epidemic 
disease in some countries (for example, 
in Brazil), and its most dangerous form 
is hemorrhagic dengue. It is caused by 
four different but related viruses, the 
reason that it is difficult for an already

infected person to become immunized 
against the disease. Dengue is prevalent 
in tropical and subtropical regions of 
Asia, Africa and South America and it is 
transmitted by the bite of the Aedes 
aegypti mosquito, a diurnal mosquito. 
The viral infection causes varied 
symptoms similar to flu, like fever, 
malaise, myalgia (muscle pain); in 
hemorrhagic dengue high fever, with or 
without convulsions, and hemorrhages 
may occur leading to circulatory failure 
and death. There is no vaccine against 
dengue since there are four agent 
viruses and it is supposed that the 
severity of the disease is greater when 
the patient is already protected against 
one type of virus and is infected by 
another. The best prophylactic method 
is to eliminate the vector mosquito.
14. What is yellow fever?
Yellow fever is a viral infection that 
occurs mainly in Central Africa and in 
the Amazon region of South America. It 
is prevented through vaccination and 
transmitted by many species of 
mosquitoes of the Aedes genus, 
including Aedes aegypti e Haemogogus. 
The infection causes clinical 
manifestations that range from 
asymptomatic cases to lethal 
fulminating cases. Generally the disease 
begins with fever, chills, malaise, 
headache, nausea and evolves to 
jaundice (increase of bilirubin in blood, 
after which the disease is named), 
mucosal and internal hemorrhages, 
hemorrhagic vomiting and renal failure.
Prevention is done by regular mass 
vaccination and vaccination of travelers 
to endemic areas. The combat against 
the vector mosquito is also an important 
prophylactic measure.
15. Why is it difficult to 
produce efficient vaccines 
against a viral infection like 
dengue and AIDS?
It is difficult to make vaccines against 
dengue because there are four different 
types of viruses that cause the disease 
(DEN1, DEN2, DEN3 and DEN4) and it is 
supposed that the protection against 
one of them aggravates the clinical 
manifestation when the person is later 
infected by the another dengue virus.
In the case of HIV, the production of a 
vaccine is difficult because the virus is 
highly mutant and evades the antibody 
action.
16. Is a viral infection treated 
with the same kind of drug 
that treats bacterial 
infections?
Antibacterial drugs, potent against a 
great variety of bacteria, are not 
effective against viruses, which are 
intracellular parasites. A viral infection 
is difficult to treat since anti-viral drugs 
are too specific and have limited 
efficiency. In general the anti-viral 
drugs reduce the viral load (number of 
virus) relieving symptoms. The anti-
virals (and anti-retrovirals, drugs that 
act against RNA virals) often inhibit the 
action of specific enzymes that 
participate in the virus life cycle.

Biology Questions and Answers
AIDS
1. How is HIV transmitted? 
What is the disease caused by 
this virus?
HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is 
supposed to be transmitted through 
blood, semen, vaginal secretions and 
maternal milk.
HIV is the virus that causes AIDS 
(acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome), a disease characterized by 
destruction of cells of the immune 
system making the body susceptible to 
many opportunistic and severe 
diseases.
2. Which type of virus is the 
HIV? What is the enzyme 
reverse transcriptase present 
in HIV?
HIV is a retrovirus, i.e., an RNA viral (its 
genetic material is RNA and not DNA).
Reverse transcriptase is a specific 
enzyme of the retrovirus responsible for 
the transcription of the viral RNA into 
DNA within the infected (host) cell. This 
DNA then commands the production of 
viral proteins and the viral replication.
3. What are CD4 lymphocytes? 
What is the relationship 
between these cells and HIV? 
How does HIV replicate?
CD4 lymphocytes are T helper 
lymphocytes that present in their 
plasma membrane receptor proteins 
called CD4.
CD4 lymphocytes are the cells that HIV 
infects and within which the virus 
replicates. HIV has proteins in its 
capsule that bind to the CD4 receptors 
of lymphocytes. Through that bond the 
virus fuses with the cell membrane and 
its content (RNA, reverse transcriptase, 
protease, etc.) penetrates into the 
cytoplasm and the viral replication 
process begins.
HIV RNA is then converted into DNA by 
the reverse transcriptase. The new DNA 
is inserted into the genetic material of 
the lymphocyte with the aid of enzymes 
called integrases. By transcription and 
translation this DNA commands the 
synthesis of proteins necessary for the 
assemblage of new viruses. Long 
polypeptides are thus produced and 
then fragmented into proteins and viral 
enzymes by the enzyme protease. So 
new HIV viruses are assembled and 
break the cell membrane to gain the 
circulation.
4. Why is AIDS difficult to 
prevent by vaccination?
It is difficult to produce a vaccine 
against AIDS because the HIV is a 
highly mutant virus. In almost every 
replication the produced viruses have 
different proteins in their surface

making difficult their recognition by the 
immune system.
5. What is the cause of the 
immunodeficiency presented 
by AIDS patients?
The cause of the immunodeficiency 
presented by AIDS patients is the 
destruction of CD4 T helper 
lymphocytes by the HIV. With this 
destruction the immune system 
becomes impaired and the body cannot 
defend itself against many diseases that 
normally do not develop in 
immunocompetent people.
6. What is the difference 
between carriers of HIV and 
AIDS patients?
A person can be a carrier of the HIV 
without necessarily being affected by 
the immunodeficiency syndrome at that 
time since the virus can remain in the 
body for many years without producing 
clinical manifestations. The AIDS 
condition is characterized when the 
patient actually becomes 
immunodeficient and begins to show 
signs and symptoms of opportunistic 
diseases.
7. How does the CD4 counting 
act to monitor the HIV 
infection? What is another 
laboratory method to follow 
up the disease?
The CD4 counting test is done from a 
blood sample of a person infected by 
the HIV. In this test the number of CD4 
cells is counted. If that number 
(concentration) is abnormally low it 
means immunodeficiency and the 
patient usually must be treated with 
antiretroviral drugs. The other test used 
to follow up the infection is the viral 
load test. In this test the number of HIV 
virus is estimated from a blood sample 
indicating whether the treatment 
(control) of the disease has been 
successful or not.
8. What are the main 
opportunistic diseases that 
can affect AIDS patients?
Among the opportunistic diseases that 
affect HIV infected people during the 
AIDS stage some are: mucocutaneous 
and systemic candidiasis, Kaposi’s 
sarcoma (blood vessel tumors that 
result in darkened spots on the skin and 
internal organs), tuberculosis, 
cytomegalovirus infection, pneumonia 
by the fungus P. Carinii (pneumocystis 
pneumonia), toxoplamosis, herpes, etc. 
Some other opportunistic diseases are: 
salmonellosis, histoplasmosis, 
aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, 
isosporiasis, lymphomas.
9. How long is the incubation 
period of the HIV? What is 
meant by acute AIDS?
The incubation period of the HIV (the 
time interval between the infection and 
the beginning of the immunodeficiency

symptoms) ranges in average from 10 
to 15 years.
Acute AIDS is the clinical situation 
characterized by signs and symptoms 
that may appear in 5 to 30 days after 
the infection by the HIV, due to the high 
replication rate of the virus on this 
period. Acute AIDS does not always 
happen and many times it is mistaken 
for common diseases like the common 
cold. The patient can present fever, 
malaise, myalgia (muscle pain) and 
arthralgia (joint pain), 
lymphadenomegaly (enlargement of 
lymphnodes), sweating and diarrhea. 
The manifestation often lasts from 3 to 
15 days.
10. What are the three phases 
into which the HIV infection is 
often divided?
The HIV infection is often divided into 
three phases: the acute phase, from the 
infection to 1 until 9 weeks after the 
infection, a phase in which the virus 
replicates and the number of CD4 
lymphocytes is reduced; the 
asymptomatic phase, lasting from 9 
weeks to often more than 10 years, in 
which the viral load remains stable and 
the CD4 count is not abnormally low; 
the AIDS stage, when the viral load is 
high, CD4 count is abnormally low and 
opportunistic diseases manifest.
11. How do antibody-based 
tests detect how HIV infection 
works?
After the infection by the HIV the 
immune system begins the production 
of antibodies (primary immune 
response) against the virus. The tests 
ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay) and Western-blot search for the 
presence of specific antibodies against 
HIV antigens in blood samples. Since 
only one positive ELISA is not 
conclusive, as false positive tests may 
happen, the Western-blot test is often 
used after the positive ELISA.
12. What is the window phase 
of an infection? How is this 
concept important for the test 
of HIV infection in blood 
banks?
The primary immune response of the 
body facing any infection is not 
immediate. The window phase is the 
period from the infection until the 
formation of detectable specific 
antibodies against the infective agent. 
In this period, immunochemical tests 
that indirectly search infections, like the 
ELISA and the Western-blot for HIV, 
give a negative result even if the person 
is actually infected by the agent. In the 
case of HIV, the window phase can last 
about 2 weeks to 3 months.
The window phase is a big problem for 
blood banks that perform only 
immunochemical tests on the donated 
blood. This is the reason why in some 
countries the blood donors are 
submitted to a series of questions 
regarding their prior behavior, mainly 
sexual and drug use related, in the 
months preceding the donation and also 
to voluntary confidential self exclusion, 
in which they declare whether their 
blood may be used or should be 
excluded. Instead of facing this 
dangerous problem, modern blood

Biology Questions and Answers
banks nowadays use the PCR 
(polymerase chain reaction) for HIV, a 
test that is not distorted by the window 
phase since it is not antibody-based. 
Using specific primers, the PCR detects 
the presence of DNA generated by 
reverse transcription of the HIV RNA.
13. What are some strategies 
of the anti-retroviral drugs 
used in the AIDS treatment?
Anti-retroviral drugs used in AIDS 
treatment try to approach any of the 
several steps of the HIV life cycle. There 
are three main groups of drugs: the 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors, that 
attempt to disallow the formation of 
DNA from the viral RNA (zidovudine, or 
AZT, ddI, d4T, 3TC, nevirapine, 
efavirenz, etc.); the protease inhibitors, 
that block the enzyme protease 
necessary for the assemblage of new 
virus (saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir, 
indinavir); and the group of entry 
inhibitors (includes fusion inhibitors), 
that try to block the entry of HIV into 
the host cell (enfuvirtide, a fusion 
inhibitor).
14. Why is the AIDS treatment 
often done with a drug 
cocktail?
The treatment of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome is often done with 
one or more anti-retroviral drugs of 
different groups, for example, a 
protease inhibitor plus a reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor in an attempt to 
approach in one single time two or more 
stages of the HIV life cycle. Besides 
that, the high mutation rate of the virus 
may make the treatment ineffective and 
for this reason the use of the drug 
cocktail allows physicians to choose 
other different drug combinations to 
escape the viral resistance.
15. What are some 
prophylactic measures against 
HIV infection?
The main prophylactic measures against 
HIV infection are: the use of condoms in 
sexual relations, not to share syringes 
and needles, careful handling of 
contaminated medical and nosocomial 
material, up-to-date information about 
the virus and its mode of transmission.

Worm Diseases
1. What are worm infections?
Worm infections are human diseases 
caused by platyhelminthes (flatworms) 
or nematodes (roundworms).
2. What are the most 
important worm infections?
The most important human worm 
infections are schistosomiasis, taeniasis, 
cysticercosis, ascariasis and 
ancylostomiasis (hookworm infection).
Other important worm infections caused 
by platyhelminthes are: fascioliasis, 
caused by Fasciola hepatica, which 
attacks the liver and the bile ducts; 
hydatid disease, also known as 
echinococcosis, caused by a taenia-like 
parasite and transmitted by feces of 
dogs in contact with sheep, with a 
clinical picture similar to cysticercosis. 
Other important infections caused by 
roundworms are: strongyloidiasis, agent 
Strongyloides stercoralis, a common 
opportunistic disease in AIDS; filariasis, 
also known as elephantiasis, 
transmitted by mosquitoes of the Culex

(lymphedema) of limbs; enterobiasis 
(pinworm infection), caused by 
Enterobius vermicularis, a worm that 
parasites the colon and the human 
perianal region; cutaneous larva 
migrans, an ancylostomiasis of the skin 
caused by Ancylostoma braziliensis.
3. What is schistosomiasis?
Schistosomiasis is a worm infection 
caused by schistosomes, a species of 
flatworms (platyhelminthes). The 
disease is prevalent in Latin America 
and in the Far East. The main species of 
schistosome found in Latin America is 
Schistosoma mansoni.
4. How do schistosomes 
differentiate regarding sex 
separation?
Schistosomes are dioecious, i.e., the 
species has separated sexes, male and 
female individuals.
5. What is the intermediate 
host of Schistosoma mansoni? 
Where does that host live?
The intermediate host of the 
schistosome is a gastropod mollusc, a 
snail of the Planorbidae family and 
Biomphalaria genus. The snail vector of 
schistosomiasis lives in freshwater, as in 
lagoons and creeks.

Biology Questions and Answers
6. What is the life cycle of the 
schistosome?
Male and female adult schistosomes live 
within blood vessels of the human 
intestines. The females release eggs 
that trespass the vessel walls and enter 
the intestinal lumen being eliminated 
with the human feces. When in water 
the egg releases a larva called 
miracidium that then swims to reach the 
snail that is the intermediate host. 
Within the snail miracidia transform into 
cercariae, another kind of schistosome 
larva. The cercariae leave the snail and 
swim until penetrating through the 
human skin. In humans the cercaria 
gains the circulation infecting mainly the 
blood vessels of the intestines, liver or 
lungs and develops into the adult form 
of the parasite.
7. What are the main phases 
and clinical manifestations of 
schistosomiasis?
Schistosomiasis has acute and chronic 
phases. Days after the infection the 
cercarial dermatitis appears at the site 
where the worm penetrated the skin. In 
one or two months the acute phase 
begins and fever, cough, muscle pain 
and nausea occur but soon disappear; in 
some people this phase may not 
manifest. In the chronic phase of the 
disease the worm infestation can affect 
the bowels, causing diarrhea, bloody 
feces, tiredness and 
hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of 
the liver and spleen). The excessive 
pressure upon the hepatic portal vein 
produces varix (collateral circulation) in 
the esophagus and the patient may 
have hemorrhages and bloody vomiting 
that may even cause death.
8. What are the main 
prophylactic measures against 
schistosomiasis?
The main measures to prevent 
schistosomiasis are: information for 
infected individuals to look for 
treatment and to not disseminate the 
disease; chemical and biological combat 
against the vector snail; basic sanitary 
conditions to avoid contamination of 
lakes, rivers and other water streams by 
infected feces; to avoid contact with 
fresh water suspected of contamination.
9. What are taenias? What are 
the diseases caused by them?
Taenias, also know as tapeworms, are 
platyhelminth animals (flatworms). The 
main diseases caused by taenias are 
taeniasis and cysticercosis.
10. How do taenias classify 
according to the division of 
sexes?
Taenias are monoecious 
(hermaphrodite), the same individual 
has female and male reproductive 
organs and undergoes self fecundation.

Biology Questions and Answers
11. What are the two main 
species of taenias that cause 
human diseases?
The two mains species of taenias that 
cause disease in humans are Taenia 
solium, or the pork tapeworm, and 
Taenia saginata, or the beef tapeworm.
Besides these species there are still the 
fish tapeworm, or Diphyllobothrium 
latum, and a tapeworm, Echinococcus 
granulosus, which lives in dogs and 
cause in humans the severe disease 
known as hydatid disease, or 
echinococcosis.
12. How do taenias obtain 
food and make gas exchange?
Tapeworms have hooks and sucking 
structures on their heads (scolex) that 
fixate the parasite in the gut wall; these 
structures often do not injure the host 
tissue. The parasite obtains food and 
makes gas exchange through absorption 
and diffusion across its skin; since it is a 
platyhelminth it does not have a 
digestive system or a circulatory 
system.
13. What are the segments 
that form the body of the 
tapeworm called? What is 
their function?
The body of the tapeworm is made of 
segments called proglottids. The 
proglottids are reproductive structures 
of the taenia and contain the organs 
that produce male and female gametes. 
As the proglottids become distant from 
the scolex (head) they mature. Mature 
proglottids can fecundate themselves or 
neighboring ones and the eggs formed 
are stored inside them. Proglottids 
called pregnant proglottids, full of eggs, 
detach from the body of the worm and 
are eliminated with the human feces.
14. Concerning their 
respective intermediate hosts 
how different are Taenia 
solium and Taenia saginata?
The intermediate hosts of Taenia solium 
are pigs and the intermediate hosts of 
Taenia saginata are cattle.
15. What is the life cycle of a 
tapeworm?
Pregnant proglottids with taenia eggs 
are released together with human feces. 
If ingested by the intermediate hosts, 
swine or bovine, the eggs break inside 
their intestines and the larva trespass 
the mucosa and gains the circulation to 
settle on muscles, heart, brain and 
other organs of these animals and then 
differentiate into cystic larvae called 
cysticerci. Humans become infected 
when eating raw or badly cooked swine 
or bovine meat contaminated by 
cysticerci. In the human intestines the 
cysticerci develop into adult worms and 
the cycle goes on.

Biology Questions and Answers
16. What is the difference 
between taeniasis and 
cysticercosis?
Taeniasis is the parasitic disease caused 
by the adult tapeworm installed within 
the human intestine.
Cysticercosis occurs when humans 
ingest eggs or pregnant proglottids of 
taenias, for example, through badly 
washed food or self infection. In 
cysticercosis humans assume the role of 
intermediate hosts of the parasite and 
the cysticerci develop within human 
organs like muscles, brain, eyes and 
subcutaneous tissue. The brain 
infestation by cysticerci, a condition 
known as neurocysticercosis, is 
extremely severe and may lead to 
death.
In the normal life cycle of taenias the 
humans are the definitive hosts and 
develop taeniasis, a less serious 
disease, and not cysticercosis.
17. If a person eats raw or 
badly cooked meat infected by 
Taenia solium or Taenia 
saginata will this person 
develop taeniasis or 
cysticercosis?
If a person eats raw or badly cooked 
meat infected by Taenia solium or 
Taenia saginata he or she will develop 
the disease taeniasis. The ingestion of 
contaminated raw or badly cooked 
infected meat means that cysticerci are 
being ingested. The human then will be 
affected by taeniases since in his or her 
gut the cysticerci may develop into an 
adult tapeworm.
18. How does self infection by 
tapeworms occur?
Taeniasis patients may develop the 
most severe form of the worm infection, 
cysticercosis, because their feces 
contain eggs and pregnant proglottids of 
the taenia and there is risk of self 
infection due to bad hygienic habits, like 
not washing the hands after defecation. 
If these individuals ingest the eggs of 
the parasite they can develop 
cysticercosis too.
19. What are some 
prophylactic measures for 
tapeworm infections?
The main prophylactic measures against 
taeniasis and cysticercosis are: not to 
ingest raw or badly cooked swine or 
bovine meat; sanitary education of the 
people; appropriate destination of feces; 
adequate treatment of infected people.
20. What is ascaris? What is 
the disease caused by this 
worm?
Ascaris, or Ascaris lumbricoides, is an 
animal of the nematode phylum, i.e., a 
roundworm. Ascaris causes ascariasis, a 
common worm infection of the intestine.

Biology Questions and Answers
21. How do ascaris obtain 
food?
The ascaris live within the human gut 
and feed from the food ingested by the 
infected person.
22. Does Ascaris lumbricoides 
present an intermediate host?
Ascaris is a monoxenous parasite, its 
life cycle is dependent only on one host 
and so it does not have intermediate 
host.
23. What is the life cycle of 
ascaris?
Adult ascaris that live within the human 
intestine can release up to 200 
thousand eggs a day. The eggs are 
eliminated with human feces and 
mature in the environment under some 
heat and moisture conditions. Humans 
may ingest mature eggs through food 
contaminated by human feces or 
through bad hygienic habits. The eggs 
again inside the human intestine release 
larvae that cross the enteric mucosa 
and gain the circulation reaching the 
lungs. In the lungs the larva mature and 
go to the airway and to the pharynx 
when they are then swallowed. Within 
the gut the larvae develop into adult 
worms.
24. What are the main 
symptoms of the pulmonary 
and of the intestinal phases of 
the ascaris infestation?
In the pulmonary phase the ascaris 
infestation causes cough, hemoptysis, 
dyspnea, fever, fatigue and may cause 
a special kind of pneumonia called 
eosinophilic pneumonia. In the intestinal 
phase the symptoms are due to 
spoliation of nutrients of the host and 
thus hunger and weight loss may 
appear. Masses of ascaris inside the 
bowels can cause severe intestinal 
obstruction.
25. What are some 
prophylactic measures against 
ascariasis?
The main prophylactic measures against 
ascariasis are: efficient washing of 
vegetables and other foods; basic 
sanitary conditions and appropriate 
destination of feces; hygiene education 
for people; combat against insects that 
can carry the eggs of the parasite, like 
flies and cockroaches.
26. What is ancylostomiasis?
Ancylostomiasis is a disease caused by 
Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator 
americanus, both hookworms belonging 
to the nematode phylum (roundworms). 
Ancylostomiasis caused by these worms 
is also called hookworm disease.
Since the parasites nourish themselves 
on human blood the infection causes

Biology Questions and Answers
anemia, hypoproteinemia and the 
patient often seems pale.
27. Which is the typical 
feature of the hookworms 
related to the way they obtain 
food and explore the host?
Both Ancylostoma duodenale and 
Necator americanus have mouthparts 
with hooks or “teeth” that help the 
fixation of the parasite in the human 
intestine wall and facilitate the tissue 
injury necessary to drain blood from the 
host. The structures are evolutionary 
adaptations for the parasitic way of life 
of these animals.
28. Are hookworms 
monoxenous or 
heteroxenous?
Hookworms are monoxenous, i.e., their 
life cycle depends only on one host.
29. What is the life cycle of 
the hookworms?
Adult hookworms within the human 
intestine release eggs that are 
eliminated with the human feces. Under 
adequate conditions of moisture and 
temperature the eggs mature in the soil 
and generate larvae. The larvae 
differentiate into thread-like infective 
larvae that can penetrate the human 
skin, generally through the feet. The 
larvae them gain the human circulation 
and reach the lungs from where they go 
to the airway and the pharynx. When 
the larvae are swallowed they enter the 
small intestine and develop into adult 
worms and the cycle restarts.
30. What are the main 
prophylactic measures against 
hookworm disease?
The main prophylactic measures against 
hookworm disease are: to avoid walking 
barefoot on soils suspected of 
contamination; basic sanitary conditions 
and appropriate destination of feces; 
treatment of infected people.

Biology Questions and Answers
Prion Diseases
1. What is a prion?
A prion is an infectious (transmissible) 
protein able to replicate by transforming 
other proteins into a copy of the prion. 
The mechanism of copying is not yet 
understood by science.
The hypothesis come out from research 
about a nervous system disease known 
as Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, 
epidemiologically associated to a bovine 
disease called bovine spongiform 
encephalitis (the mad cow disease). 
Research discovered that the infectious 
agent that causes those diseases, 
suprisingly, was a protein capable of 
copying itself and of being transmitted 
by ingestion (the reason why meat from 
contaminated animals cannot be 
consumed), inoculation and even 
heredity.
2. What are the main human 
diseases caused by prions?
The main known human diseases of 
such type are the Creutzfeldt-Jacob 
disease (CJD), the kuru and the 
Gerstmann-Sträussle-Scheinken disease 
(GSS). The hypothesis that many other 
diseases of unknown etiological agents 
are actually caused by self-replicating 
infectious proteins is strong.

Degenerative 
Diseases
1. What are degenerative 
diseases?
Degenerative diseases are non 
infectious prevalent diseases whose 
incidences increase with aging.
2. What are risk factors for 
diseases?
Risk factors for a disease are everything 
that contributes to increase the risk of 
the disease to appear. For example, for 
most cardiovascular diseases, tobacco 
smoking and diabetes mellitus are both 
important risk factors; for some cancers 
having a genetic component a positive 
family history is a risk factor, etc.
3. What are the main human 
degenerative diseases?
The main human degenerative diseases 
are divided into three groups: 
cardiovascular diseases, neoplastic 
diseases and degenerative diseases of 
the nervous system. The main 
cardiovascular diseases are 
hypertension, the cardiopathies, 
including coronary disease and 
myocardial infarction, and the 
cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs, or 
strokes). Neoplasias are benign tumors 
and cancers. The main degenerative 
diseases of the nervous system are 
Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's 
disease.
4. What is hypertension?
Hypertension is a disease in which the 
arterial blood pressure, during systole 
or during diastole, is abnormally high.
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is 
a condition that must be diagnosed and 
treated since it produces irreversible 
injuries in arteries and, later, it causes 
other severe diseases in organs like the 
heart, brain, kidneys, retina, etc.
5. What are the main risk 
factors for hypertension?
The main risks factors for hypertension 
are tobacco smoking, stress, obesity, 
sedentary lifestyle and alcoholism.
6. What is the relation 
between the maximum and 
the minimum blood pressure 
with the phenomena of systole 
and diastole?
The maximum blood pressure is the 
pressure on the wall of the systemic 
arteries during systole, i.e., when the 
heart is pumping blood to arterial 
vessels. The minimum blood pressure is 
the pressure on the wall of the systemic 
arteries during diastole, i.e., when the 
heart ventricles are relaxing and getting 
blood.

7. What are the main 
degenerative diseases of the 
heart?
The main degenerative diseases of the 
heart are heart failure, arrhythmias, 
valvular heart diseases, coronary 
insufficiency and myocardial infarction.
8. What is coronary disease?
Coronary disease, or coronary 
insufficiency, is a disease in which there 
is total or partial obstruction of one or 
more of the arteries that irrigate the 
heart musculature, i.e., obstruction of 
the coronary arteries. The disease is 
formed by slow and gradual formation 
of atheroma plaques inside the 
coronaries. The fatty plaques grow and 
block the flow of blood, a process known 
as atherosclerosis (do not confuse with 
arteriosclerosis which is the hardening 
of the arteries generally cause by 
chronic high blood pressure).
The main risk factors for coronary 
disease are tobacco smoking, diabetes 
mellitus, hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia (high level of bad 
cholesterol and low level of good 
cholesterol), stress, alcoholism and 
sedentary lifestyle.
Coronary disease may present in two 
manners, as angina pectoris or as 
myocardial infarction. If the arterial 
obstruction is not complete and 
extensive the patient often feels chest 
pain (angina pectoris), mainly when 
performing physical exercise or in any 
situation when the heart needs more 
oxygen. If the obstruction of one or 
more coronaries is complete or blood 
cannot irrigate some regions of the 
heart muscle (myocardium) the 
infarction occurs and the muscle cells of 
the affected area die.
9. What is myocardial 
infarction?
Myocardial infarction is the condition in 
which an area of this tissue or the entire 
heart muscle dies by hypoxia due to 
lack of blood irrigation. Myocardial 
infarction is a severe disease since on 
the dependence of its extension the 
heart can fail, i.e., it can no longer 
pump blood to the lungs or to the body 
or it can even stop beating (causing 
death).
The main cause of myocardial infarction 
is coronary obstruction, blocking of the 
arteries that carry arterial blood to the 
heart muscle. Other events like 
hemodynamic shock (circulation 
stoppage due to large hemorrhages, for 
example) can also cause myocardial 
infarction.
10. What is coronary bypass 
graft?
Coronary artery bypass graft is a kind of 
surgical myocardial revascularization, 
i.e., a way to provide blood to a 
myocardium whose blood supply is 
impaired or blocked due to coronary 
disease. In this surgical treatment of 
coronary disease one or more blood 
vessel grafts taken from other parts of 
the body are used to join the obstructed 
artery (in a region after the obstruction) 
with the aorta or other healthy coronary

artery thus reestablishing the blood flow 
to the myocardium. Often the blood 
vessel grafts are part of the saphenous 
vein from the leg or of the mammary 
artery from the chest or even of the 
radial artery from the forearm.
11. What are cerebrovascular 
accidents?
Cerebrovascular accident (CVA), also 
known as stroke, is the generic name 
given to infarction (tissue and cellular 
death by hypoxia) of areas of the brain 
due to vascular obstruction or 
hemorrhages. CVAs are divided into 
ischemic and hemorrhagic. In the 
ischemic CVA blocking of arteries that 
carry blood to the brain occurs; its 
cause is generally atherosclerosis 
(atheroma formation) of these vessels. 
In the hemorrhagic CVA there is rupture 
of one or more blood vessels of the 
brain with blood leakage, increasing 
intracranial pressure and thus 
interruption of blood flow in some areas 
of the brain. The severity of the stroke 
depends on the function performed by 
the affected area of the brain, for 
example, motor function, visual 
function, vegetative function, etc., and 
on the size of the involved area.
The main risk factors for 
cerebrovascular accidents are 
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, 
tobacco smoking and old age.
12. What are neoplasias?
Neoplasia is any abnormal and 
uncontrolled proliferation of cells of an 
organism. Neoplasias can be benign or 
malign. Benign neoplasias are those in 
which the cell proliferation is limited to a 
given site of the body and so neoplastic 
cells do not spread to other close 
regions or at distance through the 
circulation. Malign neoplasias are those 
in which the neoplastic cells disseminate 
at distance to other sites and organs of 
the body, a process called metastasis, 
where they continue to proliferate. 
Malign neoplasias injure tissues and if 
not eradicated they are fatal. Benign 
neoplasia can also be deadly when it 
forms a tumor that grows and 
compresses vital organs.
13. How different are the 
concepts of neoplasia, tumor 
and cancer?
Not every tumor is neoplastic and not 
every neoplasia creates tumor. Tumor is 
the generic name given to the abnormal 
increase in mass or volume of any area 
of the body (for example, the enlarged 
tonsils during throat infection are a kind 
of tumor, any inflammation creating a 
swelled area characterize a tumor, etc.). 
Neoplasias can form tumors, some of 
them very large, by aggregation of 
neoplastic cells in the region where the 
neoplasia began or in distant 
implantations. Cancer is a synonym for 
malign neoplasia.
14. What is cancer?
Cancers are malign neoplasias, i.e., 
abnormal and uncontrolled proliferation 
of cells that can disseminate to other 
sites of the body. Cancer dissemination

Biology Questions and Answers
at distance usually occurs through blood 
or lymphatic vessels.
15. How do malign neoplasias 
appear?
Neoplasias appear due to DNA 
mutations in genes that regulate the 
cellular proliferation thus making the 
cell lose its capacity to control and limit 
its division by mitosis. The cell then 
divides continuously and uncontrollably 
and this defect is transmitted to its 
daughter cells.
16. What are carcinogens?
Carcinogens are factors capable of 
producing neoplasias. Any mutagen, a 
substance that can induce DNA 
mutation, is a potential carcinogen. 
Examples of carcinogens are radiation, 
nitrous acid, many substances inhaled 
through tobacco smoking and the 
human papilloma virus (HPV).
17. How do cells of neoplastic 
tumors obtain oxygen and 
nutrients and release wastes?
In neoplastic tumors a phenomenon 
called angiogenesis occurs. 
Angiogenesis is the formation of new 
blood vessels. Neoplastic cells induce 
the formation of new blood vessels to 
irrigate and drain the neoplastic tissue.
Angiogenesis is important because the 
tumor growth depends on it. A lot of 
research on cancer has tried to discover 
natural and synthetic substances to 
inhibit angiogenesis.
18. What are the main types 
of cancer that affect humans?
Excluding skin cancer, that are the more 
easily detected and so cases are 
registered in larger number, the main 
types of cancer in men are prostate 
cancer, lung cancer, stomach cancer; in 
women, breast cancer, colon and rectal 
cancer and lung cancer are of great 
incidence. Other common cancers are 
ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver 
cancer, esophageal cancer, brain cancer 
and the leukemias and lymphomas 
(blood cancers).
Epithelial cancers, of the skin as well as 
of the internal organs, are more 
common because epithelial tissues are 
more exposed to carcinogens.
The proportional incidence of the many 
types of cancers varies according to the 
considered population.
19. What is the main risk 
factor for lung cancer?
The main risk factor for lung cancer is 
tobacco smoking. The large number of 
cases of this type of cancer is due to the 
increased number of smokers 
worldwide.

Biology Questions and Answers
The main risk factor for skin cancer is 
solar exposition of the skin without 
protection against ultraviolet radiation 
(a potential carcinogen).
The most lethal skin cancer is 
melanoma.
21. How is cancer usually 
treated?
If the cancer is in its initial stage 
treatment is often done by surgical 
removal of the neoplastic tissue. 
Cancers already disseminated are often 
treated with radiation (radiotherapy) 
and anti-mitotic drugs (chemotherapy).
22. What are the main 
degenerative diseases of the 
nervous system?
The main degenerative diseases of the 
nervous system are Alzheimer’s disease 
and Parkinson’s disease.
Degenerative diseases of the nervous 
system are caused by progressive tissue 
degradation or loss of neurons in some 
regions of the nervous system.
23. What is Alzheimer’s 
disease?
Alzheimer’s disease is a degenerative 
disease of the central nervous system in 
which the patient has progressive 
dementia and alteration of mental 
functions.
The disease generally appears after 40 
years of age and it is more frequent in 
the elderly. Image studies of the brain 
show broad loss of brain tissue. (The 
Alzheimer’s disease should not be 
confused with other mental 
deteriorations common in the elderly.)
24. What is Parkinson’s 
disease?
Parkinson’s disease is a degenerative 
disease of the nervous system in which 
the main manifestations are progressive 
motor disturbances, like tremors of feet, 
hands and mandibles (jaws) and 
walking and balance impairments. 
Parkinson’s disease is due to the 
degeneration of dopaminergic motor 
neurons, i.e., motor neurons that use 
dopamine as a neurotransmitter, 
located in a specific region of the brain, 
the mesencephalon. Such degeneration 
creates deficiency of dopamine in the 
nervous system. (Parkinson’s disease 
should not be confused with other 
causes of tremors, like the use of some 
medicines.)
