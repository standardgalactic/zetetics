If you want to understand an 
electronic device, you can simply 
review its circuit diagram. But 
even if such diagrams existed 
for the brain, they would be of 
limited use in unraveling this 
organ’s bewildering complexity. 
This is because the physical 
connections between its billions 
of neurons tell just a small 
part of the story. The real key 
is understanding how these 
cells communicate in real 
time, and how these patterns 
synchronize in the service of 
different behaviours.
Critical gaps exist in 
the toolbox for addressing 
such questions. “Electrode-
based measurements can 
provide sensitive and precise 
measurements of neuronal 
activity,” says Atsushi Miyawaki, 
team leader of the Cell Function 
Dynamics lab at the RIKEN 
Center for Brain Science (CBS) in 
Wako, Japan. “But they can only 
measure very limited numbers of 
neurons simultaneously.”
In contrast, functional 
magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) can map activity 
throughout the brain, but 
lacks the resolution to dissect 
individual circuits. In between lie 
a range of microscopic methods 
that do not quite bridge the gap 
separating these extremes.
Armed with support 
from a ten-year Japanese 
research initiative known 
as Brain Mapping by 
Integrated Neurotechnologies 
for Disease Studies 
(Brain/MINDS), Miyawaki and 
his CBS collaborator Masanori 
Murayama are making critical 
headway in building out the 
toolbox for imaging brain 
functions. Although this work 
is preliminary, these methods 
could enable researchers to 
begin interpreting the functional 
consequences of complex 
neuronal activity across large 
swaths of brain tissue.
A SMALL WORLD AFTER ALL
The cerebral cortex is the central 
hub for coordinating behaviour 
and cognition in the brain. As 
the head of the Haptic Perception 
and Cognitive Physiology lab at 
CBS, Murayama is interested in 
understanding how this process 
unfolds at both the single-cell 
and network level.
Two-photon microscopy 
(2PM) is among the most 
powerful methods for studying 
neuronal activity in live animals. 
This technique uses rapid laser 
pulses to selectively illuminate 
fluorescently-labeled ‘reporter’ 
proteins, while inflicting minimal 
damage, making relatively long-
term observations possible. 
But most 2PM systems 
have only a tiny field of view 
— the area of tissue that can 
be observed at any instant. 
Attempts to broaden this field 
of view have created trade-offs 
between image resolution and 
the frequency at which images 
can be collected.
“Those microscopes at the 
time had just one frame per 
one or two seconds, and that’s 
too slow,” says Murayama. 
“Indeed, most neurons fire at 
frequencies of more than one 
burst per second.”
Fast, high-resolution imaging 
with a broad field of view 
requires a microscope equipped 
with an extra-large, specially-
designed lens — and over the 
course of nearly a decade, 
Murayama’s team was able to 
develop such a system. In 2021, 
they used their novel FASHIO-
2PM platform to visualize more 
than 16,000 neurons across 
9 square millimetres of cerebral 
cortex tissue in live mice at more 
than 7.5 to 15 frames per second1.
Their analysis revealed that 
this cortical region has a ‘small 
world’ architecture, in which 
any given neuron is generally 
only separated from another 
by relatively few degrees of 
separation. Most have small 
numbers of connections, 
but Murayama also noted a 
subpopulation of ‘hub’ neurons. 
“These are very active, with 
more than 100 neurons 
together, including long-
distance pairs,” he says.
Preliminary functional analysis 
of these hubs has already 
revealed distinct changes in 
their activity between sleep and 
waking states in the brain.
Murayama’s team is 
continuing to explore network 
function in the healthy brain, but 
also plans to look at how these 
patterns are derailed in cognitive 
disorders like Alzheimer’s 
disease. For example, 
fMRI studies of Alzheimer’s 
patients have indicated abnormal 
activity in the default mode 
network, a brain system that 
plays a central role in self-
awareness and introspection as 
well as behavioural planning.
FASHIO-2PM could offer 
a cellular-scale view of these 
changes — and Murayama notes 
that his team’s microscope 
is also suitable for so-called 
optogenetics experiments, where 
lasers are used to modulate brain 
activity via specially engineered 
light-responsive proteins.
MOTOR FUNCTION FOCUS
Recently, Miyawaki’s lab has 
been focusing on another brain 
region, the cerebellum, which 
coordinates physical movement. 
Any time we extend our arm or 
open our mouth, the cerebellum 
is issuing instructions to direct 
that action.
Neuroscientists have 
long debated whether this 
region of the brain exhibits a 
property called somatotopy. 
This describes the concept 
wherein every part of the 
body can be directly mapped 
onto the cerebellum, such 
that one specific region of 
neurons controls the left leg, 
for example, whereas another 
governs the right leg.
In principle, this can be 
assessed by measuring the 
distinctive firing patterns, 
known as complex spikes, 
generated by Purkinje cells — 
the neurons that generate the 
output of the cerebellum. But 
in practice, existing imaging 
methods are ill-suited for 
achieving this task at scale.
“Consequently, the 
somatotopic organization of the 
cerebellum is still controversial,” 
says Miyawaki. “We needed 
a new method for wide and 
high-spatiotemporal-resolution 
mapping of complex spikes.”
Miyawaki’s lab has pioneered 
the development of numerous 
powerful imaging tools, including 
a fluorescent reporter protein 
called cameleon that reveals 
changing cellular levels of 
calcium ions associated with 
neuronal spikes. A few years 
ago, they managed to label every 
Purkinje cell (large neurons with 
numerous branching extensions) 
in the mouse cerebellum with the 
cameleon reporter. In parallel, 
they devised a custom-built 
‘macroscope’ instrument that 
could survey the entire cerebellar 
surface through a surgical 
window into the skull. 
ORGANIZATIONAL PRINCIPLE
In a 2021, Miyawaki’s group 
succeeded in clustering 
Purkinje cells into roughly 200 
‘segments’, each containing 
50 to 100 Purkinje cells2. They 
subsequently examined how 
these segments responded 
after stimulating muscles in 
each of the mouse’s four limbs, 
and were surprised to learn 
that the activity profiles were 
indistinguishable at first glance. 
But more extensive mathematical 
analysis revealed that each 
stimulus was actually eliciting a 
subtle but distinctive spatial and 
temporal pattern of response in 
multiple segments throughout 
the cerebellum.
This offers compelling 
evidence against somatotopy, 
and Miyawaki believes this 
organizational principle makes 
good evolutionary sense. He 
draws parallels to computer 
servers, which use arrays of 
redundant hard drives. “The 
whole system is composed of 
16 hard drives and is based on 
distributed processing, and any 
two hard drives can be broken 
at any time,” he says. This same 
strategy could preserve motor 
function in the aftermath of 
localized injury at a particular 
site in the brain.
Miyawaki’s lab now aims to 
take a deeper dive into these 
segments — perhaps using the 
Murayama lab’s FASHIO-2PM 
platform. “By using 2PM, we 
could maybe zoom in on a 
specific segment to visualize 
how Purkinje cells in the segment 
synchronize their firing,” he says. 
“That’s one of our next goals.”
