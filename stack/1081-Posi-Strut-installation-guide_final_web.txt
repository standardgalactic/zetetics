Posi-Strut trusses are not to be modified in any way on site without the approval of the manufacturer.  
Any Posi-Strut truss damaged in transport or handling cannot be repaired on site  
without the advice or approval of a Professional Engineer.
STORAGE On site storage of the product should be for a limit-
ed period of time prior to installation. All Posi-Strut components 
should be strapped and stacked vertically with the bottom chord 
clear of the ground, supported on spacers located directly under 
web points.  If stored in a flat position, sufficient bearings should  
be provided to prevent any lateral bending. 
After being strapped together, Posi-Struts should be covered  
with a waterproof wrap to protect them from short-term exposure  
as well as inclement weather. When covered, ensure adequate  
circulation around the trusses. Store and handle with care and protect  
the ends and edges of the Posi-Strut components from damage. 
HANDLING Handle the Posi-Struts with care in a vertical  
orientation only (not in a flat position) to avoid twisting or sagging. 
When loading/offloading with a crane, slings should always be 
attached to the lumber chords, and NOT to the metal webs as this 
may damage the product (no load should be applied to the metal 
webs as this may cause damage to the steel itself or withdrawal  
of the web from the chord). Slings should be attached at panel 
points closest to the quarter points of the Posi-Strut length.  
SAFETY Unbraced floor members are unstable. Do not allow anyone to walk on unbraced Posi-Struts. Install all  
strongbacks, ribbons and bracing at the locations specified on the installation drawings before proceeding to install  
the subfloor. Posi-Strut trusses must be restrained at all support points to prevent lateral movement or toppling.
DO install proper temporary bracing. Bracing is vital to the safe installation of Posi-Strut floors. Temporary bracing 
includes diagonal bracing, longitudinal strapping/purlins and permanent strongbacks. 
DON’T store building materials on unbraced Posi-Struts. Do not store building materials whose weight exceeds  
design loads on the floor, even for a short period of time. Weight of materials should be spread out over an area covering a minimum  
of 3 Posi-Strut trusses (see page 3). Do not apply heavy concentrated construction loads to the Posi-Strut floor.
DO fasten subfloor sheathing. Subfloor sheathing provides lateral support and should be fully fixed (glued and nailed/ screwed)  
to the Posi-Struts before additional loads are applied to the floor. 
DON’T drill holes in the chords, cut or remove the metal webs, notch / cut the chords or the strongbacks.

Installation Tips
Proper coordination and open communication between all subcontractors are essential during the design and installation stages of all 
construction. Too often structural elements are cut, notched or damaged as a result of lack of planning. Performance of the structural 
elements is affected and in some cases, damage is irreparable and replacement is extremely expensive. Better planning between  
the different subcontractors saves time and money while ensuring the structural integrity of the building. Please review the installation 
layout, important dimensions and instructions before starting the installation of the Posi-Strut system. For any questions you may 
have, please contact your Posi-Strut manufacturer.
SUBFLOOR
To prevent cracks in heavy floor tiles (ceramic, porcelain, slate, etc.), it is important to choose the appropriate type, quality and thickness 
of subfloor. A minimum of 1“ (subfloor and backer board combination) is required to ensure proper support to the finished flooring  
material. In addition, the backer board must be installed perpendicular to the subfloor and the joints must be overlapped to avoid  
any dimensional variance. 
ELECTRICITY
Although electric wires are less intrusive due to their smaller size, the fact remains that the vertical passage of wiring may encounter  
obstructions caused by the structural elements. Electrical wires should only be attached to the lumber bottom and top chords or wood 
web verticals and in such a way as to prevent them from touching the metal webs.
PLUMBING
One of the most common cases of damage to structural floor components is the passage of vertical plumbing through the chord of the 
structural element. Yet, simply planning ahead allows the contractor and subcontractor to properly position the floor trusses. If you need  
to move a Posi-Strut truss on site, please consult your authorized Posi-Strut manufacturer first. To allow movement of plumbing pipes,  
it is suggested to install a rubber or foam-like mat around the pipe where it touches the truss.
When planning the installation and faced with potential problems 
with plumbing, electricity or ductwork interfering with the truss, 
please contact your Posi-Strut manufacturer.
  
They will check if one of the Posi-Struts can be slightly moved  
to avoid damaging the truss. If this is not possible, the addition  
of another Posi-Strut may be necessary. Although this option will be 
slightly more expensive, it will provide better support and minimize 
the potential of finished flooring cracking, caused by poor support 
and deformation of the subfloor.
Vertical plumbing installation
VENTILATION DUCTS
To avoid unpleasant surprises on the job site, it is important to inform your Posi-Strut manufacturer of the positioning and the dimensions 
of the different ventilation ducts for your project. They can then better advise you on available options, and design the floor according  
to your specifications. Good planning will allow, when possible, the passage of large ducts through the floor cavity.

Do not overload floor with building materials. Make sure to distribute the loads uniformly  
on the floor so as not to exceed the design loads. Do not cut, drill into,  
or alter the Posi-Strut components, nor cut notches in the strongbacks.

INSTALLATION DIRECTION
Ensure that all Posi-Strut trusses are installed in the correct orientation relative to all supports. There is typically only one correct ori-
entation for installation and depending on the specific project, this may not be evident by simply looking at the truss.  In lieu of a marking 
from the supplier indicating proper TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT and RIGHT directions, consult the engineering drawing for that specific truss.  
The drawing will always show the correct orientation of the truss relative to its supports.
Orientation as displayed on 
engineering / shop drawing
Incorrect truss placement 
(Truss is upside down)
SHEATHING ALLOWABLE LOADING
The maximum allowable load of sheathing materials temporarily stored on Posi-Strut trusses should not be greater than the design load.  
For typical residential floor loading with plywood and OSB sheets that are sized 4’x8’, and 4’x12’, this equates to approximately:
Plywood
OSB
Thickness
Number  
of sheets

3/4"
13
23/32"

Where the sheets are stacked by hand, they should span lengthways  
across the trusses. When lifted via crane, they should bear on five  
bearing blocks the width of which should be 2’ longer than the width 
of the sheathing.
Notes:	
1. Ensure that stacked sheathing materials are supported by at least three trusses.
	
2. Construction loads on floors are meant to be short term duration only.

Posi-Strut trusses are generally placed perpendicular to the load-bearing supporting walls and should be located so that the distance 
between the centrelines of the trusses does not exceed the design spacing.  Always consult the placement plan and ensure to note and 
plan for all girders, openings and any other special requirements before beginning installation. Proper installation and bracing are vital 
to the safe construction of Posi-Strut systems. 
Recommended installation is as follows:
1.	
Review the layout and identify any multi-ply girders. Connect girder plies ahead of installation according to the connection  
instructions on page 10 and install the girders into position first. 
2.	
Plan the installation sequence after the girders and place the Posi-Strut trusses close to where they are required.  Only remove  
a minimum number of trusses from storage and place them around the building so that they may be installed in a reasonable  
period of time.  Posi-Strut trusses should be protected from inclement weather and stored as per storage instructions.
3.	
Make sure that Posi-Strut trusses are installed in their correct orientation. Manufacturers may mark the Posi-Strut truss with the 
word “TOP”, "BOTTOM", "LEFT", "RIGHT". In lieu of any markings, consult the engineering drawings prior to installation. Before  
lifting the Posi-Strut trusses into place, make sure the correct end of the truss is at the appropriate support (as the end details may 
be different) and that the Posi-Strut is correctly oriented vertically. If intermediate supports are being used, ensure that they are in 
the correct position (as shown on the engineering drawings) and that all intended truss bearing points align with the actual supports.
4.	
For top chord bearing Posi-Strut trusses (with an end vertical at the extension), the gap between the bearing and lumber vertical 
web must not exceed 1/2” (12 mm). For top chord bearing Posi-Strut trusses (see pages 6 and 7) without an end vertical, the first 
diagonal must overlap the support by a minimum of 1.0” (25 mm) to ensure proper load transfer.
5.	
Required bearing length for all trusses should be as indicated on the engineering design drawings but never less than 1.5".
6.	
Posi-Strut trusses should be installed square and vertical /plumb. The maximum deviation from horizontal should not exceed 1/4" 
and the maximum deviation from vertical should not exceed 1/16".
7.	
Temporarily brace the Posi-Strut trusses in place as they are being installed, utilizing temporary strapping/purlins and diagonals  
as well as permanent strongbacks.
8.	
Install the strongback bracing as required before closing in the ends. Strongbacks are always installed vertically (not flat oriented) 
and must be attached tight to the underside of the top chord or tight to the topside of the bottom chord. Strongbacks should be  
fastened to a minimum of three trusses. Please refer to strongback installation details on page 12.
9.	
All Posi-Strut trusses must be restrained at all support points to prevent lateral movement or toppling.
10.	 Complete the installation of all end details (e.g. ribbons) as well as all 
bottom / top chord bracing as indicated on the engineered drawings.
11.	 Temporary lateral stability is achieved by providing a diagonally braced 
system across at least 3 Posi-Strut trusses. Additional diagonal bracing 
should be added at a maximum of 20' spacing or 10 truss spaces 
(whichever is less) in long truss runs. Temporary strapping/purlins 
should be added every 8'. Temporary bracing may be progressively 
removed as the decking is installed and fixed.
12.	 It is important to fasten the subflooring to the trusses immediately  
following the application of construction adhesive. Waiting until the  
adhesive is dry to screw down the subfloor is a common mistake, one 
that can cause floor systems to squeak. Temporarily attaching a subfloor 
with a few nails, only to install screws a few days later, only contributes 
to the future possibility of floor noises.
13.	 The maximum load of sheathing materials temporarily stored on 
the Posi-Strut trusses is limited. Please refer to page 3 and do not  
overload or exceed the design loads of the truss (even if temporary).
14.	 Ensure to use only SPF No. 2 or better S-dry/KD (kiln dried) lumber.
15.	 Ensure nail and screw edge and end distances are as per building code.
Remember to install the required strongbacks before closing in the ends.
Please refer to the BCSI Canada guide section BCSI-B7C, for a complete list  
of recommendations for temporary and permanent restraint/bracing  
of 3x2 and 4x2 parallel chord trusses.

Vertical Load Transfer
CLEARANCE OVER NON-LOAD BEARING INTERNAL WALLS
BLOCKING INSTALLATION UNDER NON-LOAD-BEARING WALLS
Non-load-bearing walls
TYPICAL VERTICAL LOAD TRANSFER
Depending on the different site conditions and load-path requirements,  
the project engineer may require blocking for vertical load transfer.  
To the left is a typical example of blocking needed between the trusses 
to transfer loads from a bearing wall above. This detail indicates only 
one possibility, but highlights the need to have a proper load path  
designed for your building.
Please consult the project engineer to ensure that load transfer 
blocking is properly detailed and adequately installed on site.  
It is also the responsibility of the project engineer to determine  
the different shear and bracing details required for the project.  
In addition, trusses cannot support load-bearing walls from above  
unless specifically designed to do so.
Load transfer blocking  
as per project engineer’s 
instructions
Posi-Strut trusses on the upper storey of multi-storey dwellings should be kept clear of internal non-load-bearing walls of the lower 
storey. It is recommended that the Posi-Strut truss be connected to these internal partition walls using MiTek TR or HTC ties / clips in 
order to provide lateral stability to the wall below while allowing the Posi-Strut trusses to deflect under load.
The placing of non-load bearing partition walls on the Posi-Strut floor system may require additional stiffening of the structure. Building 
designer to assess the weight of the partition wall. There are two situations:
1.	 If the length of the partition wall is parallel to the Posi-Strut trusses, 
a.	 And the length of the partition wall is 8’ or less, no additional truss support is required. However 2x4 blocking is required  
every 2’ o/c to reinforce the subfloor under the non-load bearing partition walls. 
	
These must be installed with ZC2 clips and with four 10d x 1.5” nails.  
This reinforcement will not only ensure a better assembly but will  
also minimize the potential squeaking problem caused by poor wall  
support or poor wall to floor nailing.
b.	 And the length of the partition wall is greater than 8’, an additional  
Posi-Strut truss is required below the partition wall or the weight  
of the wall must be accounted for in the design.
2.	 If the length of the partition wall is perpendicular to the Posi-Strut trusses,  
generally no additional support is required.

For any questions you might have, or if a strongback has been damaged during construction, please contact  
your MiTek authorized Posi-Strut manufacturer. They have the expertise to assist you and answer your questions.
Strongbacks
Strongbacks are boards of dimensional lumber (usually 2x6) that are positioned at specific 
locations within the floor system cavity. These boards act as mini beams, introducing a 
transverse stiffness element that allows the trusses to work together as a system,  
resulting in increased performance of the floor against vibration. Strongback size,  
grade and positions vary by project and are typically specified on engineering design 
drawings that are produced by authorized Posi-Strut manufacturers.
MITEK ENGINEERING DRAWINGS
A copy of all engineering drawings are sent along with the trusses to the job site and are included with the installation layout  
and installation guide. 
It is essential to consult these documents for specific technical  
details such as orientation, loading, bearings, spacing and  
strongback positioning.
Strongback positions (highlighted in yellow) are shown on the 
Posi-Strut engineering drawings. Position, size, grade and nailing 
instructions should be respected.

STRONGBACK ATTACHMENT
Strongbacks need to be tightly connected to the perpendicular bearing walls  
to ensure their performance. Also, the strongbacks need to be attached, with no 
gap, to the Posi-Strut using three 3.25" nails or two 3" #8 screws.

SCAB OPTION
OVERLAP OPTION
When the strongbacks are positioned against the top or bottom chord, the addition of a 2x4 block 
attached against the top and bottom of the Posi-Strut chords will improve the assembly and per-
formance of the floor system. Connect the strongback and the block with two 3.25” nails or two  
3” #8 screws.
When the strongbacks are positioned against a top or bottom chord, use 
two 3” #8 screws to install the strongbacks. It is important to ensure that 
the strongback is in full contact with the top or bottom chord.
INSTALLATION AGAINST THE TOP OR BOTTOM CHORD
2x4 block
When the strongbacks are positioned against vertical  
posts, use three 3.25” nails to install the strongbacks. 
For a stronger connection, use two 3” #8 screws 
instead of the nails.
It is important to ensure that the strongback  
is in full contact with the vertical post and  
the horizontal chord.
