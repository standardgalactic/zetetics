Calculation of functional gradients
and extended diﬀerentiation of operators
S. Ya. SEROVAJSKY∗
Received July 7, 2003
Abstract — Qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimal-control problems and
inverse problems in mathematical physics largely implies the calculation of functional
gradients giving optimality criteria or closing errors. As a rule, this procedure is used in
calculating necessary extremum conditions and in gradient methods. If a system under
study is linear, then calculation of a functional gradient presents no serious diﬃculties.
Yet, in nonlinear problems of mathematical physics there arise substantial diﬃculties
stemming from the fact that, as the control (parameter to be identiﬁed) is put to vari-
ation, the state function of the system also undergo changes. Thus, for the functional
gradient to be found, diﬀerentiability of the state function with respect to control
must be established. Substantiation of this property for nonlinear inﬁnite-dimensional
systems is a point far from being trivial. Moreover, the example given below shows
that, although the system of interest contains no nonsmooth expressions, the required
property can be violated. This circumstance does not allow one to calculate functional
gradients by standard methods and use traditional optimization methods. Nonethe-
less, the system under study displays a property that can be considered as a weak
form of diﬀerentiability of the state function with respect to control. As a result, we
arrive at the notion of extended derivative of an operator, presenting generalization
of the classical types of operator derivatives. With the help of this notion, one can
ﬁnd a functional gradient even if its direct determination is impossible. In this way,
we can enlarge the area of applicability of optimization methods. It is shown that, for
extended derivatives, an analogue to the inverse function theorem can be formulated
which makes it possible to give a general scheme permitting calculation of functional
gradients in nonlinear problems of mathematical physics even in those cases in which
the state function turns out to be a nondiﬀerentiable function of the control variable.

−∆y + |y|ρy = v
(1)
with some homogeneous boundary conditions (Dirichlet problem), where v is
the control variable, y is the state function of the system, and ρ is some positive
constant. We deﬁne the spaces Y = H1
0(Ω) ∩Lq(Ω), and V = Y ′ = H−1(Ω) +
Lq′(Ω), where Y ′ is the space conjugate to Y , q = ρ + 2, and 1/q + 1/q′ = 1.
By the theory of monotone operators (see [1], for instance) one can establish
the fact that for any v ∈V equation (1) has a unique solution y = y(v) in the
space Y such that the mapping v →(v) is continuous and weakly continuous.
We consider the functional I(v) = J(v) + K[y(v)], where the functionals J
and K, bounded and weakly semicontinuous from below, are deﬁned respectively
in the spaces V and Y , the former functional being a coercive one.
In the
optimal-control problem, it is required to ﬁnd such a control that minimizes the
functional I in the space V . There holds the following lemma:
Lemma 1. The optimal-control problem is a solvable problem.
Indeed, since the functional I is bounded from below on a bounded set U,
then there exists a minimizing sequence {vk} being a bounded sequence, be-
cause the functional J is coercive. Then, in accord with the Banach—Alaoglu
theorem, one can separate out from this sequence such a subsequence (with
preservation of initial designations) that vk →v weakly in V . Taking into ac-
count weak continuity of v →y(v), we ﬁnd that y(vk) →y(v) weakly in Y .
Since the functionals under consideration are weakly semicontinuous from be-
low, the inequality I(v) ≤limk→∞I(vk) holds, from which the optimal property
of v follows.
Necessary conditions for extremum can be obtained by standard methods.
In particular, the solution v0 of the problem on minimization of a Gateaux-
diﬀerentiable functional I in the Banach space V satisﬁes the equality (see [2])
I′(v0) = 0,
(2)
where I′(v) is the derivative (gradient) of I at the point v. Thus, to construct
necessary conditions for extremum in the case of interest, it suﬃces to establish
diﬀerentiability of the optimality criterion. In turn, this necessitates proving
diﬀerentiability of the mapping v →y(v).
Implicitly or explicitly, a natural way to obtain the desired result leans upon
the inverse function theorem [3]. Let the Banach spaces V and Y , the operator
A : Y →V of class C1, and the points y0 ∈Y and v0 = Ay0 be set parameters.
According to the inverse function theorem and providing that the inclusion
A′(y0)−1 ∈L(V, Y ),
(3)
holds (here L(V, Y ) is the set of linear continuous operators acting from V
into Y ), there exists such a vicinity O of the point y0 that the set A(O) presents
a vicinity of the point v0, the restriction of A into O is reversible, and the
corresponding inverse operator is diﬀerentiable at the point v0. Note that, for
inclusion (3) to be valid, it is necessary and suﬃcient (by the Banach theorem

Calculation of functional gradients . . .

about inverse operator) that the linearized equation
A′(y0)y = v
(4)
be uniquely solvable for any v ∈V in the space Y .
We assume that there takes place a continuous inclusion
H1
0(Ω) ⊂Lq(Ω).
(5)
By the Sobolev theorem, this condition being valid if ρ < 2n/(n −2) for n > 2
(ρ is an arbitrary number ﬁnite at n = 2). Prove the following theorem:
Theorem 1. If the inclusion (5) holds, then the operator y( · ) is diﬀeren-
tiable in V and its derivative y′(v0) at an arbitrary point v0 satisﬁes the equality
−∆y′(v0)h + (ρ + 1)|y(v0)|ρy′(v0)h = h
∀h ∈V.
(6)
Proof. We introduce the operator A : Y →V choosing, as Ay, the left-hand
side of (1). At any point y0 ∈Y , this operator has a derivative satisfying the
equality
A′(y0)y = −∆y + (ρ + 1)|y0|ρy
∀y ∈Y.
Then, the linearized equation (4) assumes the form
−∆y + (ρ + 1)|y0|ρy = v.
(7)
We multiply this equality by the function y and formally integrate the resulting
equality over the domain Ω; this yields:
Z
Ω
|∇y|2 dx + (ρ + 1)
Z
Ω
|y0|ρy2 dx =
Z
Ω
vy dx.
(8)
If condition (5) is valid, then the spaces Y and V coincide respectively with
the sets H1
0(Ω) and H−1(Ω), and equality (8) gives the estimate ∥y∥Y ≤∥v∥V .
Using the classical theory of elliptic-type equations (see [3], for instance), we
obtain that (6) is an equation uniquely solvable in the space Y for any v ∈V .
Application of the inverse function theorem proves diﬀerentiability of the solu-
tion of (1) with respect to the free term. To explicitly ﬁnd the derivative of y( · )
at an arbitrary point v0, we are going to prove the equality
−∆[y(v0 + σh) −y(v0)] + [|y(v0 + σh)|ρy(v0 + σh) −|y(v0)|ρy(v0)] = σh. (9)
Dividing this equality by σ and passing to the limit of σ →0 with allowance for
diﬀerentiability of y( · ), we obtain relation (6). The theorem is proved.
Based on the proved statement, we readily establish necessary conditions for
the optimality condition.
Theorem 2. Suppose that the functional J is Gateaux-diﬀerentiable on
the optimal control v0, and the functional K is Freshet-diﬀerentiable at the

386
S. Ya. Serovajsky
point y(v0) and, additionally, inclusion (5) is valid. Then, v0 satisﬁes the equa-
tion
J′(v0) + p0 = 0,
(10)
where p0 is the solution of the homogeneous Dirichlet problem for the equation
−∆p0 + (ϱ + 1)|y(v0)|ρp0 = K′[y(v0)].
(11)
Proof. Taking into account Theorem 1 and using the theorem about diﬀer-
entiation of complicated functions in Banach spaces, we ﬁnd that the derivative
of I at the point v0 satisﬁes the relation
⟨I′(v0), h⟩= ⟨J′(v0), h⟩+ ⟨K′[y(v0)], y′(v0)h⟩
∀h ∈V,
where ⟨a, b⟩denotes the value of the linear continuous functional a at the point b.
We multiply equality (7) by an arbitrary function λ from the space V ′ and
integrate the resulting equality over the domain Ωby the Green formula; this
yields
⟨−∆λ + (ρ + 1)|y(v0)|ρλ, y′(v0)h⟩= ⟨λ, h⟩
∀h ∈V.
With inclusion (5), equation (11), analogous to (7), is uniquely solvable in V ′.
Then, we set λ = p0 in the last relation and ﬁnd:
⟨I′(v0), h⟩= ⟨J′(v0) + p0, h⟩
∀h ∈V.
Insertion of the found derivative of I into (2) yields equality (10). The theorem
is proved.
If condition (5) is violated, then relation (8) no longer yields an a priori
estimate for the solution of the linearized equation in the space Y , and the
right-hand side of (8) even may be meaningless at all because of low regularity
of v. Thus, in proving diﬀerentiability of the solution of the equation under
examination with respect to the ﬁrst term, one cannot use the inverse function
theorem. With the latter fact, lack of diﬀerentiability of the operator under
consideration still remains to be seen. Yet, the following statement is valid:
Theorem 3. Condition (5) being violated, the operator y( · ) is not Gateaux-
diﬀerentiable.
Proof. Suppose that y0 is a continuous function. Then the left-hand side
of (7) for any y ∈Y belongs to the space V∗, being in the absence of inclusion (5)
the proper subset of V . Hence, the inclusion (3) is violated. If y( · ) is a Gateaux-
diﬀerentiable operator at the point v0 = Ay0, then for any v ∈V for σ →0 we
have convergence
y(v0 + σv) −y0
σ
→y′(v0)v
in Y.
Consider equality (9). After division of this equality by σ and passage to the
limit we obtain:
−∆y′(v0)v + (ρ + 1)|y0|ρy′(v0)v = v.

387
We compare this expression with (7) and conclude that for any v ∈V the
linearized equation has a solution y = y′(v0)v from the class Y , proving condi-
tion (3) to be fulﬁlled. Yet, it was established earlier that the latter is not the
case, at least for v ∈V \ V∗. The established contradiction accomplishes the
proof.
Thus, for the considered example two variants are possible.
The case of
suﬃciently low dimensions of the given domain and nonlinearity index, both
making inclusion (5) valid, (i. e., the case of a comparatively low degree of
complexity of the state equation) is a regular case, with the state function
being diﬀerentiable with respect to control. Here, the gradient of the minimizing
functional can be calculated in the standard manner, and the extremum problem
can be solved by traditional optimization methods.
On the contrary, if the
dimensions of the domain and that of the nonlinearity index are so high that
inclusion (5) does not take place, then we encounter a singular case. In the latter
situation, the degree of complexity of the equation under consideration turns out
to be so high that the dependence of the state function on the control (parameter
to be identiﬁed) becomes no longer diﬀerentiable, although equation (1) itself
seems to be not involving explicit nonsmooth terms (like modulus, minimum
of two functions, etc.). In the singular case we are unable to determine the
functional gradient by standard methods; this circumstance hampers application
of classical optimization methods for solving the posed extremal problem. Thus,
in the absence of inclusion (5) the conjugate equation (11) can no longer have
an a priori estimate of the solution in the space V ′. As a result, the optimality
conditions obtained previously turn out to be incorrect. We are going to show
now that, using some weak form of diﬀerentiability of the operator, we can
extend the proposition in Theorem 2 to the singular case.
2.
SINGULAR CASE
The considered example shows no desired result because of bad properties of
linearized equation (7) in the singular case. Yet, even in the absence of inclu-
sion (5) some positive results for this equation can be established. We deﬁne
sets
Y (v0) = H1
0(Ω) ∩{y | |y(v0)|ρy ∈L2(Ω)},
V (v0) = Y (v0)′.
The space Y (v0) is a Hilbert space with the scalar product
(y, z) =
Z
Ω
∇y · ∇z dx + (ρ + 1)
Z
Ω
|y(v0)|ρyz dx.
The set V (v0) transforms in a Hilbert space with the norm of the conjugate
space. Then, equality (8) yields the estimate ∥y∥Y (v0) ≤∥v∥V (v0), from which
it follows that for any v from a space V (v0) narrower than V , equation (7) is
uniquely solvable in the class Y (v0), wider than Y . The statement obtained
can be interpreted as a weak form of inclusion (3). It would appear natural to
be supposed that, for the above reasons, the operator y( · ) has some positive
properties, although weaker than diﬀerentiability. As a result, we arrive at the

388

notion of extended derivative of an operator. Let the linear topological spaces V
and Y , and the operator A : V →Y , be set parameters.
Deﬁnition. An operator A is called a (V0, Y0; V, Y )-extended β-differenti-
able operator (or a simply extended-diﬀerentiable operator) at a point v0 ∈V if
there exist linear topological spaces V0, Y0, V , and Y that satisfy some continu-
ous inclusions V∗⊂V0 ⊂V , Y ⊂Y0 ⊂Y∗, and also a family of subsets β from V
and a linear continuous operator D : V0 →Y0 (extended derivative) such that
the equality A(v + h) = Av + Dh + r(h) is fulﬁlled, and for any set B from β
and for σ →0 convergence r(σh)/σ →0 in Y , uniform over h ∈B, takes place.
If β is a family of ﬁnite (all bounded and compact) subsets V , then we
have (V0, Y0; V∗, Y∗)-extended (simply extended) diﬀerentiability according to
Gateaux (or according to Frechet and Hadamard). Apparently, the (V, Y ; V, Y )-
extended β-derivative coincides with the derivative in the Sebastyan el Silva
sense [4], the (V, Y ; V, Y )-extended Gateaux, Frechet, and Hadamard derivatives
coincide with the respective classical derivatives, and the (V, Y ; V∗, Y )-extended
Gateaux derivative coincides with the derivative over the subspace V∗[4].
Turn back to equation (1). Consider an arbitrary point v0 ∈V and the
above-deﬁned spaces V (v0), Y (v0), V∗, and Y∗.
Theorem 4.
The operator y( · ) for equation (1) at the point v0 is a
(V (v0), Y (v0); V∗, Y∗)-extended diﬀerentiable according to Gateaux.
Proof. Consider again equality (9), which results from (1), for any h ∈V .
We multiply this equality by a suﬃciently smooth function λ and integrate the
resulting equality over the domain Ω; this yields
−

∆[y(v0 + σh) −y0]λ dx +

hλ dx, (12)
where y0 = y(v0), (gσ)2 = (ρ + 1)|y0 + ε[y(v0 + σh) −y0]|ρ, ε ∈[0, 1].
Consider the equation
−∆p + (gσ)2p = µ
(13)
and Hilbert spaces Yσ = H1
0(Ω) ∩{y | gσy ∈L2(Ω)}, Vσ = Y ′
σ, coincident
with the previously deﬁned classes Y (v0) and V (v0) at σ = 0. We multiply
equality (13) by the function p and integrate the resulting equality over the
domain Ω; this yields the estimate ∥p∥V ′
∗≤∥µ∥Y ′
∗. It follows from here that for
all numbers σ and all values of h ∈V∗and µ ∈Y ′
σ equation (13) has a unique
solution p = pσ(µ) from the class V ′
σ. In (12), we deﬁne λ = pσ(µ); then, we
obtain:
Z

(14)
In the case of σ →0, in view of continuity of the solution of (1) over the free
term, for any h ∈V we have convergence y(v0+σh) →y0 in Y . Then the family
{y(v0 + σh)} is bounded in the space Lq(Ω); from here, boundedness of {gσ} in
the class L2q/ρ(Ω) follows. We multiply equality (13) by a function pσ(µ) and

Calculation of functional gradients . . .
389
integrate the resulting expression over the domain Ω; in this manner, we obtain
the inequality
∥pσ(µ)∥2
V ′
∗+ ∥gσpσ(µ)∥2
2 ≤∥pσ(µ)∥V ′
∗∥µ∥Y ′
∗,
where ∥· ∥p is the norm in Lp(Ω). We deﬁne a set M = {µ ∈Y ′
∗| ∥µ∥≤1},
and for any h ∈V obtain the following estimates:
sup
µ∈M
∥pσ(µ)∥V ′
∗≤1,
sup
µ∈M
∥gσpσ(µ)∥2

This yields the inequality

∥(gσ)2pσ(µ)∥q′ ≤∥gσ∥2q/ρ sup
µ∈M
∥gσpσ(µ)∥2 ≤∥gσ∥2q/ρ ≤c,
where c is some positive constant.
In the case of σ →0, after separating out a subfamily with preserved pre-
vious designations we obtain convergence pσ(µ) →p(µ) weakly in V ′
∗and uni-
form over µ ∈M.
We use the Rellich—Kondrashov theorem and ﬁnd that
pσ(µ) →p(µ) strongly in L2(Ω) and almost everywhere in Ω. As a result, we
obtain convergence (gσ)2pσ(µ) →(ρ + 1)|y0|ρp(µ) almost everywhere in Ωuni-
formly over µ ∈M. Using the lemma about weak convergence in the spaces
of integrable functions [1], with due regard for the above estimate we have:
(gσ)2pσ(µ) →(ρ + 1)|y0|ρp(µ) weakly in Lq′(Ω) and uniformly over µ ∈M.
We pass to the limit of σ →0 in (13) and conclude that the function p(µ) is a
solution of the homogeneous Dirichlet problem for the equation
−∆p(µ) + (ρ + 1)|y0|ρp(µ) = µ.

We deﬁne a linear continuous operator D : V (v0) →Y (v0) through the

Let B be an arbitrary ﬁnite subset from V ∗. Using the previously established
results, we have convergence pσ(µ) →p(µ) weakly in V ′
∗and uniformly over
µ ∈M, h ∈B. Then, from the last inequality we deduce that
y(v0 + σh) −y(v0)
σ
→Dh
in Y ∗uniformly over h ∈B.
Hence, the operator y( · ) is an operator extended-diﬀerentiable according to
Gateaux. The theorem is proved.
Thus, solvability of the linearized equation in the comparatively weak sense
is indeed accompanied by some positive properties of y( · ). It is signiﬁcant that
the notion of extended diﬀerentiability allows one to clarify the dependence of
the solution of (1) on the free term. Indeed, for low values of ρ and n (being
parameters of the problem determining the degree of its complexity) in the pres-
ence of inclusion (5) the solution of the equation is diﬀerentiable with respect to
the free term by Theorem 1. Simultaneously, at suﬃciently large values of these
parameters in the absence of the above inclusion the operator y( · ) is no longer
diﬀerentiable by Theorem 3. Thus, with increase in ρ and n, for some reasons
the properties of the equation at some stage undergo step changes: diﬀerentia-
bility existed but, then, has vanished. Theorem 4 gives a more accurate picture
of the phenomenon in question. Extended diﬀerentiability is observed always;
yet, the spaces that enter the deﬁnition of extended derivative explicitly depend
on ρ and n (and also on the point at which the derivative is calculated). For
low values of these parameters extended derivative coincides with the classical
derivative. As the parameters increase, i. e., with increasing degree of complex-
ity of the equation under study, there occurs a critical situation in which the
Gateaux derivative no longer exists. Nonetheless, the operator y( · ) still re-
mains extended-diﬀerentiable and, here, the greater are ρ and n, the stronger
are the spaces that enter the deﬁnition of the extended derivative diﬀer from
the natural spaces V and Y and, hence, the diﬀerential properties of the oper-
ator suﬀer more pronounced distortions. Thus, we observe a gradual, and not
sharp, worsening of the solution of the problem as a function of the free term
with increasing degree of complexity of the problem. Here, we emphasize once
again that the class the extended derivative belongs to essentially depends on
the point where diﬀerentiation is performed. It can be expected that, with es-
tablished detailed picture of the phenomenon under study, one will become able
to obtain for equation (1) results unachievable by traditional methods resting
on the more crude apparatus of classical derivatives. There holds
Theorem 5. The propositions in Theorem 2 remain valid if the functional J
is diﬀerentiable over the subspace V∗at the point v0 and K is a functional
(Y (v0), R; Y∗, R)-extended diﬀerentiable according to Frechet at the point y(v0).
Proof. There holds the relation
I(v0 + σh) −I(v0) = J(v0 + σh) −J(v0) + K[y(v0 + σh)] −K(y0) ≥0
∀h ∈V∗,
σ > 0,

where y0 = y(v0). It follows from diﬀerentiability of K that K[y(v0 + σh)] −
K(y0) = K′(y0)z + η(z), where |η(z)| = o(∥z∥Y∗). Hence, for any h ∈V∗we
obtain
K[y(v0 + σh)] −K(y0)
σ

+ η(z)

Y∗.
Dividing the preceding inequality by σ and passing to the limit of σ →0, we
obtain:
⟨J′(v0), h⟩+ ⟨K′[y(v0)], y′(v0)h⟩≥0
∀h ∈V∗.
Using relations (15), (16), and (11), we arrive at the inequality
⟨J′(v0) + p0, h⟩≥0
∀h ∈V∗,
which yields optimality condition (10). The theorem is proved.
Note that, with condition (5) being fulﬁlled, restrictions on the function-
als considered in Theorems 2
5 are coincident.
Simultaneously, Theorem 5
does not require any restrictions to be imposed on the nonlinearity index of the
equation and on the dimensions of the domain providing for validity of inclu-
sion (5). Thus, the use of the apparatus of extended derivatives allows one to
eliminate the indicated restriction and extend the optimality condition to the
singular case. It is signiﬁcant that the use of traditional optimization methods
oriented on classical operator derivatives does not allow the pursued purpose
to be achieved. In the latter case, it seems equally impossible to obtain op-
timality conditions basing on the penalty method (see [5]) since this method
imposes rather stringent requirements on the properties of the conjugate equa-
tion, in fact equal in strength to the validity of inclusion (5). It is not a mere
coincidence that in all the examples considered in [5] the dimensions of the
domain and the nonlinearity index were assumed to be suﬃciently small. In
the extremum theory, they often use methods of nonsmooth optimization bear-
ing upon such notions as subdiﬀerential, Clark derivative, etc. [6]. With the
help of these notions, it becomes possible to minimize some particular function-
als not diﬀerentiable in the classical sense (module of a function, minimum of
two smooth functions, etc.). Nonetheless, the corresponding generalizations of
derivatives touch exclusively on algebraic properties of the object under study
and in no way take the topological nature of the phenomenon under study into
account. On the contrary, in the case of extended diﬀerentiability the priority
remains with the topological aspect, whereas the algebraic aspect in the deﬁ-
nition of the derivative precisely reproduces properties of classical derivatives.
Of course, there is nothing preventing the both approaches from being united
by deﬁning, for instance, an extended Clark derivative so that this derivative
would have the same relation to the ordinary Clark derivative as the relation
the introduced notion has to the derivative in the Sebastyan el Silva sense.

EXTENDED DIFFERENTIABILITY
OF INVERSE FUNCTION
The necessary conditions for extremum were obtained in the regular case using
the inverse function theorem, which makes it possible to prove diﬀerentiability of
the state function with respect to control. In the general case, the weak variant
of this property (extended diﬀerentiability) was established immediately. The
obtained positive result suggests that a general statement concerning extended
diﬀerentiability of the inverse function in linear topological spaces can be for-
mulated, Theorem 4 being a particular manifestation of this general statement.
Consider some linear topological spaces V and Y , an operator A : Y →V ,
and points y0 ∈Y and v0 = Ay0. A locally convex space V∗with a limited
convergence topology is set, being a subspace V with some vicinity of zero O∗.
We assume that the following condition is fulﬁlled:
Condition A. For any v from the set O = v0 + O∗there exists a point
y = y(v) such that Ay = v.
If the operator A is Gateaux-diﬀerentiable on O, then, by the theorem about
the mean, the following equality holds:
Ay −Ay0 =
Z 1
0
A′[y0 + t(y −y0)] dt (y −y0).
For any v ∈O, we introduce an operator G(v) ∈L(Y, V ) by the formula
G(v) =
Z 1
0
A′[y0 + t(y −y0)] dt.
The equality
G(v)[y(v) −y0] = v −v0
∀v ∈O
holds. From here, it follows that
⟨λ, G(v)[y(v) −y0]⟩= ⟨λ, v −v0⟩
∀λ ∈V ′,
v ∈O.
(17)
For any v ∈O we consider linear topological spaces V (v) and Y (v) such
that Y , Y∗and Y (v) are continuously and densely embedded into V (v), Y (v),
and V , respectively. We assume the following condition to be fulﬁlled:
Condition B. For any v ∈O there exists a continuous continuation G(v)
of G(v) over Y (v) such that Im G(v) ⊂V (v).

With the inclusion y(v) ∈y0 +Y (v) taken into account, equality (17) yields:
⟨G(v) ∗λ, y(v) −y0⟩= ⟨λ, v −v0⟩
∀λ ∈V (v)′,
v ∈O.
(18)
We deﬁne a linear equation
G(v) ∗p = µ.
(19)
Consider some locally convex space V∗with a limited convergence topology, into
which for any v ∈O the space Y (v) is continuously and tightly embedded, and
also an arbitrary set M bounded in Y ′
∗and some family β of subsets from V∗.
We assume that the following restriction holds.
Condition C. For all v ∈O, µ ∈Y (v)′ equation (19) has a unique solution
p = pµ(v) from the set V (v)′, and for any B ∈β in the case of σ →0 there
takes place convergence pµ(v0 + σh) →pµ(v0) weakly in V ′
∗and uniformly over
µ ∈M, h ∈B .
The following theorem about extended diﬀerentiability of inverse function is
valid.
Theorem 6. If Conditions A, B and C are fulﬁlled, the operator A−1 :
V →Y at the point v0 has (V (v0), Y (v0); V∗, Y∗)-extended β-derivative D de-
ﬁned by
⟨µ, Dh⟩= ⟨pµ(v0), h⟩
∀µ ∈Y (v0)′,
h ∈V (v0).
(20)
Proof.
Consider a family {hσ} such that for σ →0 there takes place
convergence hσ →h in V∗. It follows from the deﬁnition of topology of the
space V∗that for any set Λ bounded in V ′
∗convergence ⟨λ, hσ⟩→⟨λ, h⟩uniform
over λ ∈Λ takes place. The family {pµ(v0)} (µ ∈M) is bounded in the weak
topology of V ′
∗, which is separable [7]. Since in a locally convex space any weakly
restricted set is bounded, the family {pµ(v0)} (µ ∈M) is bounded in V ′
∗. As a
result, we obtain convergence ⟨pµ(v0), hσ⟩→⟨pµ(v0), h⟩uniform over M.
We set λ = pµ(v) for µ ∈M in (18) and obtain
⟨µ, y(v) −y(v0)⟩= ⟨pµ(v), v −v0⟩
∀v ∈O,
µ ∈M.
(21)
In V∗, we set an operator r putting r(h) = y(v0 + h) −y(v0) −Dh. For any
µ ∈M, h ∈V∗and suﬃciently small σ, from (20) and (21) we derive:
⟨µ, r(σh)/σ⟩= ⟨µ, [y(v0 + σh) −y(v0)]/σ −Dh⟩= ⟨pµ(v0 + σh) −pµ(v0), h⟩.
Passing to the limit of σ →0, we establish convergence ⟨µ, r(σh)/σ⟩→0
uniform over µ ∈M, h ∈B, which yields that r(σh)/σ →0 in Y∗uniformly
over h ∈B. Thus, the operator D is indeed the extended derivative of the
inverse operator under consideration. The theorem is proved.
Let us show that all conditions of Theorem 6 are valid for equation (1).
Lemma 2. The operator A deﬁned by equation (1) satisﬁes conditions A,
B and C.

Proof.
Condition A implies solvability of (1) in a vicinity of the given
point, which statement is, of course, valid. The operator G(v) is characterized
by the relation G(v)y = −∆y + g(v)2y
∀y ∈Y , where g(v)2 = (ρ + 1)|y(v0) +
ε[y(v) −y(v0)]|ρ, ε ∈[0, 1]. We choose the spaces V∗and Y∗as previously and
set Y (v) = H1
0(Ω) ∩{y | g(v)y ∈L2(Ω)}, V (v) = Y (v)′. Then, we can deﬁne an
operator G(v) by the relation G(v)y = −∆y + g(v)2y ∀y ∈Y (v) and establish
validity of Condition B. In the latter case, equation (19) has the form
−∆p + g(v)2p = µ
and is analogous to equation (13). Then, validity of condition C can be estab-
lished in the same manner like validity of the analogous property in proving
Theorem 4. The lemma is proved.
It follows from the latter statement that, in fact, Theorem 5 can be proved
using the standard optimization methods [2] with replacing classical operator
derivatives with extended derivatives. Lemma 2 also shows that the presence
of a weak form of the conditions of the inverse function theorem in the latter
example guarantees fulﬁllment of positive properties of the corresponding inverse
operator which are close in sense to diﬀerentiation. Yet, it still remains to check
whether this result is preserved or not in the general case.
Lemma 3. If the conditions of the inverse function theorem are fulﬁlled,
then Conditions A, B, and C are valid.
Proof. Condition A, i. e., the existence of an inverse operator in a vicinity
of the point of interest is a direct corollary from the inverse function theorem.
We deﬁne the spaces V∗= V and Y∗= Y . Then, equalities V (v) = V and
Y (v) = Y are valid and, hence, the operator G(v) coincides with G(v), and
Condition B is trivial. It remains to establish the validity of Condition C.
Equality (19) can be written as
G(v0)∗p = [G(v0)∗−G(v)∗]p + µ.
From inclusion (3) it follows that the operator
Γ = [G(v0)∗]−1 = [A′(y0)∗]−1 = [A′(y0)−1]∗
belongs to the class L(Y ′, V ′). This yields the relation
p = Γ{[G(v0)∗−G(v)∗]p + µ},
(22)
equivalent to (19). We deﬁne the operator F : V ′ →V ′ by choosing, as Fp, the
right-hand side of (22). Thus, we have an operator equation Fp = p. Taking
the fact into account that the mappings v →y(v) and y →A′(y) are continuous
respectively at the points v0 and y0, we conclude that the mapping v →G(v)∗
is continuous at the point v0. Then, the vicinity O of the point v0 can be chosen
so small that the inequality
∥G(v)∗−G(v0)∗∥≤ε∥Γ∥−1
∀v ∈O,

will be fulﬁlled, where ε ∈(0, 1). As a result, we obtain the estimate
∥Fp −Fp′∥≤∥Γ∥∥G(v)∗−G(v0)∗∥∥p −p′∥≤ε∥p −p′∥
∀p, p′ ∈V ′,
v ∈O.
Hence, the operator F is a compressing operator and, hence, for all v ∈O and
µ ∈Y ′ the equation Fp = p has a unique solution p = pµ(v) from the set V ′.
From (22), we derive the inequality
∥pµ∥≤∥Γ∥∥µ∥
1 −ε
∀v ∈O,
µ ∈Y ′.
Let us establish continuity of the mapping v →pµ(v) at the point v0. There
holds the equation
G(v)∗pµ(v) = G(v0)∗pµ(v0),
which can be transformed to
G(v0)∗[pµ(v) −pµ(v0)] = [G(v0)∗−G(v)∗]pµ(v).
This yields the inequality
sup
µ∈M
∥pµ(v) −pµ(v0)∥≤∥Γ∥∥G(v0)∗−G(v)∗∥sup
µ∈M
∥pµ(v)∥
≤∥Γ∥2
1 −ε ∥G(v)∗−G(v0)∗∥.
As a result, we obtain continuity of the mapping v →pµ(v) at the point v0,
uniform over µ ∈M, and, hence, the validity of Condition C. The lemma is
proved.
Based on the obtained results, the following conclusions can be drawn:
• the conditions of the inverse function theorem being satisﬁed, extended
diﬀerentiability of the inverse function always takes place;
• a situation is possible when extended diﬀerentiability is observed under
violation of both the conditions and statements of the inverse function
theorem;
• extended diﬀerentiability is capable of replacing the classical diﬀerentia-
bility in applications.
The established results, representing a development of previously reported
works [8, 9] by the present author give promise that extended derivatives may
successfully replace the classical derivatives in various applications.
Among
such applications are numerous problems that arise in nonlinear analysis (the
implicit function theorem and the Lusternik theorem), in diﬀerential topology
(notions of diﬀerentiable manifold, tangent space, and tangent ﬁbration), in the
Lee group theory (relations between Lee groups and Lee algebras), in the theory

of nonlinear equations (dependence of solution on parameter, inverse problems,
solution bifurcations and branching, stability of equilibrium position by linear
approximation), in the optimal control theory (necessary and suﬃcient condi-
tions for extremum, direct optimization methods), in approximation techniques
(quasilinearized algoritms), etc.
