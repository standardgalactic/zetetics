Abstract. In a recent paper we proposed a means to realize a quasicrystal with eight-fold symmetry by
trapping particles in an optical potential created by four lasers. The quasicrystals obtained in this way,
which are closely related to the well-known octagonal tiling, oﬀer unique possibilities to study the eﬀects
of quasiperiodicity on physical properties. This method allows, furthermore, to transform the structures,
to inﬂate or deﬂate them, include interactions or disorder and thus realize a large variety of theoretical
models, both classical and quantum. In this paper we present details of the model, derive a number of
interesting geometrical properties of the optical quasicrystals, as well as some results obtained by numerical
calculations.
1 Introduction
The unusual structural properties of solid state quasicrys-
tals are by now well established, more than a quarter cen-
tury after the ﬁrst publication [1]. The best quasicrys-
talline samples, which are obtained by standard methods
of crystallization, are perfectly ordered over very great
distances, as indicated by their extremely narrow, in-
dexable diﬀraction peaks. In the absence of translational
invariance, quasicrystals can have rotational symmetries
forbidden for crystals, such as 5-fold, or in the present
case, 8-fold symmetry. The property of repetitivity of lo-
cal environments in quasicrystals ensures that identical
ﬁnite conﬁgurations of atoms occur in close proximity to
each other. Quasicrystals have a self-similarity property
with respect to change of length-scale. These properties
lead one to expect novel physical properties in these ma-
terials, and indeed, they are seen to possess intriguing
electronic, magnetic and mechanical properties. Unfortu-
nately theoretical understanding of these materials lags
behind the experimental ﬁndings, in part due to the com-
position of solid state quasicrystals, which are usually bi-
nary or ternary alloys. Their structural complexity makes
it impossible to use analytical methods and it stretches
numerical computations to the limit.
Thus, the realization of a single component quasicrys-
tals has been a long-standing goal. We recently showed [2]
how one can use the optical potential due to four stand-
ing wave laser ﬁelds to trap particles and realize a two
dimensional quasiperiodic structure with eight-fold sym-
metry. In this paper we give details of this structure, the
8-fold optical quasicrystal, which is closely related to the
well-known octagonal (or Ammann-Beenker) tiling qua-
sicrystal [3]. When the trapped particles are atoms, de-

scribed by a simple tightbinding model at suﬃciently low
temperatures, this type of system should provide valuable
insights into the quantum properties of quasicrystals. In a
quite diﬀerent context, trapping colloidal particles in such
potentials could allow to study phases resulting from com-
petition between the quasiperiodic optical potential and
electrostatic interactions.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents
the experimental set-up. Section 3 presents the mathemat-
ical background and notation for this problem when lifted
to four dimensions. Section 4 derives the condition that
must hold in order to obtain the optical quasicrystal, Sec-
tion 5 details some of its principal structural properties
and Section 6 discusses some properties of the intensity
landscape seen by the trapped particles. Section 7 presents
discussions and conclusions.
2 Set-up for a quasiperiodic optical potential
in two dimensions
We consider a region where standing waves have been
set up using four laser beams oriented at 45◦angles in
the xy plane, as shown in Figure 1. The wavelengths, λ,
are the same for all the beams, as are their amplitudes.
We will consider the situation where all the polarizations
are perpendicular to this plane, allowing the amplitudes to
sum up to an absolute maximum. The alternative choice,
of using in-plane polarizations yields smaller maxima of
amplitudes, smaller contrast, and would therefore be less
eﬃcient in trapping particles. For the case of four standing
waves, the intensity is given by:

where ⃗r = (x, y) is the position vector in the plane. The
four wave vectors are given by:

with n = 1, . . . , 4. Notice that the four beams can have
arbitrary diﬀerent phase-shifts φn. As long as the relative
phase shifts are maintained at some ﬁxed arbitrary values,
these phase shifts do not change the nature of the struc-
tures obtained, as discussed later. In colloidal systems,
particles are attracted to maxima of the intensity – the
“optical tweezer” phenomenon [4]. In cold atomic gases,
due to the ac Stark shift, atoms are attracted to the max-
ima if the laser frequency is chosen to be slightly smaller
than the atomic resonance frequency – so-called “red” de-
tuning [5]. The optical potential seen by particles in both
these situations is V (⃗r) ∝−I(⃗r), i.e. particles minimize
energy by going towards local maxima of the intensity
ﬁeld. The potential corresponding to equation (1) is an
instance of a quasiperiodic function, a particular case of
almost periodic functions, the theory of which goes back
to Bohr [6] and Besicovitch [7]. Notice that the connec-
tion between almost periodic functions and aperiodic sets
of points is a far more complex mathematical problem,
ﬁrst raised by the mathematician Meyer in the 70’s who
“invented” the ﬁrst quasicrystals [8].
The plot of Figure 2 shows a complex intensity land-
scape of local maxima, local minima and saddlepoints with
intensities 0 ≤I ≤16|I0| obtained for a random choice
of the phases φn. The function I(⃗r) is quasiperiodic since
there is no integer relationship between the four wave vec-

tors ⃗kn. The intensities of the peaks, or local maxima, have
a range of values with the upper bound Im = 16I0.
We now assume that occupied sites are those local
maxima for which |I(⃗rj)| ≥Ic. Ic is the cutoﬀvalue, which
can depend for instance on the temperature, for systems
dominated by thermal ﬂuctuations. In practice, the cutoﬀ
is not expected to be sharp, but the corresponding struc-
tures are not signiﬁcantly aﬀected, providing it lies within
a suﬃciently narrow range of values, as we will see later.
This occupancy assumption supposes that there is ergod-
icity and that particles can eﬀectively reach the minima
of the potential. For certain choices of the cutoﬀ, one ob-
tains the kind of tiling illustrated in Figure 3. In Section 4,
we derive this series of values of cutoﬀ, Ic/I0 in terms of
wavelength λ.
Figure 3 shows the optical quasicrystals obtained for
Ic/I0 = 15 (top) and 15.82 (bottom). The edgelength of
the two quasicrystals are approximately 3.81λ and 9.19λ,
respectively. The tilings are shown superposed on the in-
tensity proﬁle, represented by a shaded plot (dark shades
for small intensity). The two are examples of the type
of structure that we will refer to as the optical qua-
sicrystal (OQ). It is closely related to the standard oc-
tagonal tiling (OT) [9,10] composed of squares and 45◦
rhombuses. For larger and larger values of the cutoﬀ,
approaching 16|I0|, only the largest maxima (correspond-
ing to the lowest energy states) will be occupied, and the
atomic density in the xy plane correspondingly decreases.
As the cutoﬀtakes on successive values in the series,
the lattice vectors get larger, by powers of the irrational
number α = 1 +
√

3 Deﬁnitions of the 4D model
The wave vectors of the laser beams, ⃗kn, can be re-
garded as projections in the xy plane of four orthogo-
nal 4-dimensional vectors ⃗Kn = K⃗εn, where ⃗εn form the
standard orthonormal basis of the 4D space R4. We have
K =
√
2 k and ⃗kn = π( ⃗Kn), where π is an orthogonal
projection matrix onto the xy physical plane denoted P
(see Appendix).
The directions orthogonal to P deﬁne a perpendicular
plane P ′, so that the 4D space is the direct sum P ⊕P ′
of the two planes and the corresponding complementary
projection matrix is π ′ = I −π.
The projections ⃗en = π(⃗εn) in P, and ⃗e ′
n = π ′(⃗εn)
in P ′, of the 4D orthonormal basis are shown in Figure 4.
The norms of these vectors are en = e ′
n =

√
2.
In P, we choose the orientations of the x and y axes
parallel to the vectors ⃗e1 and ⃗e3. In the P ′ plane, the x′
and y′ axes are oriented along the ⃗e ′
1 and −⃗e ′
3 directions,
respectively. These projections are shown in Figure 4.
A point ⃗R = (R1, R2, R3, R4) in the four dimensional
space can be written in terms of its components in P and
P ′ as ⃗R = (⃗r,⃗r ′), where ⃗r = (x, y) and ⃗r ′ = (x′, y′) lie in P
and P ′, respectively. The transformation can be written
in terms of a 4D rotation R as follows:

If ⃗r ′ = 0 the last equation gives the 4D coordinates
(R1, . . . , R4) of a point ⃗r = (x, y) in P, a property which
will be used later on in the analysis of the optical po-
tential. Some of the properties of the 4D cubic lattice
with regard to symmetry under eight-fold rotations are
given in the Appendix. If ⃗R = (⃗r,⃗r ′) and ⃗K = (⃗k,⃗k ′)
denote the decompositions of 4D vectors ⃗R and ⃗K in
the direct sum P ⊕P ′, the 4D scalar product writes
⃗K.⃗R =  KnRn = ⃗k.⃗r + ⃗k ′.⃗r ′ by orthogonality of P
and P ′.

discussion is that the intensity function I of equation (1),
can be seen to be the restriction to the plane P of the
4D-periodic function I: I(⃗r) = I(⃗r, 0). The function I
is obviously periodic with respect to the 4D cubic lat-

surface of equation 4
n=1 cos( ⃗Kn.⃗R) = 0. This is periodic
with respect to BCC lattice, and it intersects P along lines
where I(⃗r) = 0.
The projections of the basis vectors of B in the
planes P and P ′ are ⃗bn = π(⃗βn) and ⃗b ′

set-up and the properties of the optical quasicrystal in the
next section.
4 Construction of an optical quasicrystal
In equation (3) above we have not written the phases, for
simplicity, as they do not modify the type of structures
– more precisely, adding the phases φn in equation (1) is
equivalent to a global 4D translation ⃗τ, such that K⃗τ.⃗εn =
φn. Such translations yield OQ’s belonging to the same

cated on a body centered square lattice.
“local isomorphism class” (meaning that any ﬁnite pattern
occurs in both tilings with the same probability).
Local maxima of I in the xy plane are “selected” if
their intensity I(⃗r) > Ic for some value of the cutoﬀIc.
For suﬃciently large values of the cutoﬀ, the regions in
which I(⃗R) > Ic form small disjoint domains, Δj, cen-
tered on the lattice points of the BCC lattice, as shown
in the 2-dimensional example of Figure 6. Therefore a se-
lected local maximum of I occurs when a domain Δj inter-
sects the xy plane P. Expanding around each maximum
to quadratic approximation, one ﬁnds
I(⃗R)/I0 ≈16 −8k2 ⃗R 2 = 16 −8k2(⃗r 2 + ⃗r ′2).
(4)
As Ic tends to 16, these domains shrink to lattice points
and their shapes tend to spheres of radius ρ such that
8k2ρ2 = 16 −Ic/I0. In the same limit the projections
of Δj on P (or P ′) tend to disks Dj (or D′
j) of radius ρ.
If such a domain Δj cuts the plane P, the local max-
imum of I occurs at a point ⃗sj = (x, y), close to the pro-
jection ⃗rj of ⃗Rj. Moreover, ⃗sj converges to ⃗rj in the limit
Ic →16. It is easy to see that if Ic is large enough, the
local maxima of I in the domain I > Ic can be indexed by
lattice points of the BCC lattice. This point is explained
in more detail in Appendix.
One now has an alternative form of the condition which
must be satisﬁed for a lattice point to be selected. In or-
der for a domain Δj, centered about ⃗Rj, to intersect the
plane P the projection ⃗r ′
j of ⃗Rj must lie within a cor-
responding domain in the P ′ plane. Figure 7 shows two
domains, for values Ic/I0 = 3 and 13, lying inside an
octagon shaped domain W, the projection in P ′ of the
BCC unit cell based on the four vectors π

enough Ic, this domain tends to a disk (see Fig. 7), of

We now turn to the standard octagonal tiling [9–13].
This tiling, illustrated in Figure 8, can be obtained from
the four dimensional lattice π

method. In this case, the selection window is the already
deﬁned domain W. This tiling can be transformed into a

2. This operation can be re-
peated inﬁnitely many times, and it can be reversed (deﬂa-
tions). Inﬂations can be carried out in the cut and project
method by redeﬁning the selection window in the P ′ plane.
Thus, the series of inﬂated octagonal tilings are associ-
ated with concentric selection windows, W1, W2, . . . , Wp,
the series of octagons scaled down by factors of αp with
p = 1, 2, . . . The condition for maximal coincidence of the
optical quasicrystal and the octagonal tilings is that the
disk D′ overlaps with one of these selection windows, Wp.

the size of the domains corresponding to the optical

In our present case, with the standard projection
method, which consists of substituting p = 0 in equa-
tion (5), and projecting points whose coordinates ⃗r ′ fall
within the domain D′
0, one obtains the tiling shown in
Figure 9 (left). The next tiling corresponds to p = 1 and
it is shown in Figure 9 (right).

Equation (5) can now be used to determine the cutoﬀ
value of the intensity Ic. This results in the following con-
dition for the special values of Ic, namely
Ic/I0 ≈16 −8
√
2πα−2p,
(7)
where the quadratic approximation used is satisfactory for
p > 1. The values of Ic for the ﬁrst few values of p along
with the corresponding edge lengths are given in Table 1.
Note that the tiling corresponding to p = 0 cannot be
obtained by selecting peaks based on their intensities.
Using the selection rule I ≥Ic in real space, as opposed
to the projection method already illustrated, one gets the
structures shown in Figure 3. These tilings diﬀer from the
ones shown in Figure 9 in one respect which is not visi-
ble to the eye, namely the positions of vertices are very
slightly displaced from their ideal positions, since they are
given by the intersection of physical plane P with the do-
mains D′ of the 4D lattice. The displacements from the
ideal structure get progressively smaller as the cutoﬀ(or
equivalently, p) is increased. Another point to note is that
all the OQ for p ≥1, can be generated by the intensity se-
lection rule, but not the one corresponding to p = 0, which
can only be obtained by the projection method. This is
due to the fact that I(⃗r) is a monotonically decreasing
function of ⃗r only up to a certain distance, making the 4D
construction inapplicable for small Ic. As Ic decreases, the
disjoint domains Δj centered on the BCC lattice expand
and ﬁnally become connected.
To resume, the optical quasicrystals can be obtained in
two ways. The usual cut-and-project method using circu-
lar windows as the selection rule gives quasiperiodic struc-
tures with well deﬁned, ﬁxed, edge lengths. The alterna-
tive method is the one we have described using the optical
potential and the criterion I ≥Ic, which, via equation (5)
generates an almost perfect optical quasicrystal. The sec-
ond method can be experimentally realized in a conceptu-
ally simple and physically transparent way, in contrast to
the former, which relies on an unphysical 4D theoretical
construction.
We conclude this section by noting that the OQ is sta-
ble under ﬂuctuations of value of the cutoﬀin the following
sense: as long as the changes are small compared to the
spacing between cutoﬀs Ic, the vertices OQ can be labeled
by the set of quasilattice vectors ⃗rn for a given value of p.
Additional vertices appear, in the empty plaquettes for
example, if the cutoﬀis lowered below the ideal value (ver-
tices disappear if the cutoﬀis raised) without modifying
the “backbone” of the structure.
5 Structural properties
In this section we discuss the structure of the optical qua-
sicrystal, compared with that of the standard octagonal
tiling. As seen in the previous section, we deﬁned the OQ
as the set of points corresponding to a circular selection
window of area equal to one of the series of octagons,
W, W1, . . . corresponding to the inﬂations of the octago-
nal tiling. The OQ and the OT coincide, for the majority
of points, whose perpendicular space projections lie in the
intersection of the two selection windows. The diﬀerences
arise due to the few remaining points. If we take the ref-
erence structure to be the OT, then certain points are
missing, in the OQ, as can be seen from the empty oc-
tagons and hexagons in Figure 9, which are not present in
Figure 11. Conversely, there are some closely-spaced sites
in the OQ, not present in the OT. A simple calculation
shows that about 2% of the OQ points are missing in the
OT and the same percentage of the OT points are missing
in the OQ.
To understand more precisely these structure diﬀer-
ences between the OT and the optical quasicrystal, it
is necessary to enter into the details of the perpendic-
ular space projections of diﬀerent local environments of
the octagonal tiling. These local environments correspond
to coordination numbers z = 8, 7, . . . , 3 and are labeled
A, B, C, . . . , F as shown in Figure 11. It can be shown [13]
that the coordination number z of any vertex of the OT is
simply related to its position in P ′, as shown in Figure 10.
Comparing the two acceptance domains for the OT and
for the OQ, one sees that the diﬀerences arise in the out-
lying E and F domains. The resulting diﬀerences are that
(i) some sites are missing, giving rise to the empty oc-
tagons and hexagons in the OQ, and (ii) some new F sites
appear in close proximity to another F site. In quasicrys-
tals such as the OT, two such close-lying sites are well-
known in the literature, as being related by a “phason-
ﬂip”. A phason excitation mode is a collective excitation
made up of many such individual hops [14]. Whereas in
quasicrystals only one of the pair of sites is occupied, in
the present case of the OQ, both sites are simultaneously

occupied – we will refer to these as twin-sites. Thus, in
sum, the OQ has some missing sites, leading to holes in
the structure, and some twin-sites, compared to the OT
which is a more homogeneous structure. These structure
diﬀerences, which concern a small fraction of atomic po-
sitions, diﬀerentiate the OQ from the standard OT. In
the next section we indicate how these diﬀerences can be
done away with or minimized, by introducing repulsive
interactions.
One can now understand the eﬀects of small changes
in the cutoﬀintensity with respect to the values given by
equation (7). When the value of the cutoﬀIc is slightly
higher than the value given by equation (5) correspond-
ing to a particular OQ, some points are eliminated, leading
to a structure with more holes. Conversely, if the cutoﬀis
lowered slightly with respect to the optimal value then the
density of points slightly increases, along with the appear-
ance of more twin-sites. One can introduce disorder in the
model by smoothing the cutoﬀ, which we have assumed
to be abrupt. If the selection condition is relaxed, by im-
posing a stochastic rule for peaks of intensities I close
to Ic, there will be a spatial disorder. One can smooth the
irregularities in spatial density by introducing repulsive
interactions (next section).
We now turn to the diﬀraction pattern of the optical
quasicrystal, one of its readily measurable properties in an
experiment. The general method for ﬁnding the Fourier
transform and indexation of peaks is discussed for exam-
ple by Katz and Gratias in reference [15]. The structure
factor consists of Bragg peaks whose positions are given
by the reciprocal lattice of the 4D cubic lattice, and whose
peak intensities are given by the Fourier transform of the

selection window. Due to the close similarity of their selec-
tion windows, the structure factor of the OQ and that of
the OT are expected to be very similar, with peaks in the
same positions but with slight diﬀerences in their inten-
sities. Here we will conﬁne our attention to the indexing
of Bragg peaks. It is interesting to observe that spherical
selection windows were introduced by Grimm and Baake
in the context of the diﬀraction patterns of quasiperiodic
tilings [16], as a useful approximation in the calculation of
the structure factor of, for example, the icosahedral tiling.
For the optical quasicrystal, in contrast, we see that the
spherical window turns out to be the correct, physically
imposed choice, provided only that the cut-oﬀIc is large
enough.
The 4D basis vectors are ⃗Kn = (2
√
2π/λ)⃗εn. After
projection in P, one obtains the four lattice vectors of
equation (2)
⃗kn = 2π

sities are determined by the Fourier transform of the selec-
tion window, which is of octagonal shape for the OT, and
circular shape for the OQ. The resulting diﬀerences be-
tween the two structure factors would show up only under
a detailed comparison of peak intensities. Figure 12 shows

where N is the number of sites in the sample. The set of
intense peaks nearest the origin correspond to the com-
binations {±1, ±1, 0, 0} and permutations thereof, in ac-
cordance with the condition in equation (9). The struc-
ture factors of successive OT for p ≥1 will be the same,
only rescaled by powers of α−p, to take into account the
inﬂation in real space.
6 Distribution of intensities in the optical
quasicrystal
6.1 Global distribution function of peak intensities
To describe quasicrystals made by trapping particles in
this quasiperiodic potential, one needs to know the dis-
tribution of values of their potential energy, Vi. We re-
call that the potential energy is proportional to the inten-
sity, and that in terms of dimensionless variables Vi/V0 =
−I(⃗ri)/I0. The distribution of potential energies is the dis-
tribution of values of the peak intensities, I(⃗ri)/I0, which
we denote P(I). The 4D description of the optical poten-
tial allows one to calculate P(I) explicitly for large values
of the intensity. Using the 4D function I deﬁned in equa-
tion (3) we deﬁne the intensity function in the x′y′ plane,
I⊥(⃗r ′):
I⊥(⃗r ′) = I(⃗r = 0,⃗r ′) = I0

The intensity of a peak, I(⃗ri) is given to good approx-
imation by I⊥(⃗r ′). Figure 13 shows the constant inten-
sity contours of this function in the P ′ plane, along with
the selection windows W1 and W2. The total number of
peaks of intensity between I and Im, N(I) ∼
 I0
I
P(I)dI,
is proportional to the area A(I) enclosed by the contour
I⊥(x′, y′) = cst. For large intensity, the quadratic approx-
imation for I⊥holds, and the contours are circles. For
large I, one has:
N(I) = A(I) =
1
32π (Im −I) .
(13)
This results in a probability distribution P(I) ∼C for
large I, where C is a normalization constant. We have
compared this prediction with the peak intensity distri-
bution calculated numerically. Samples were created by
taking a variety of random angles φn in equation (1), and
the largest peaks were found numerically. The sample av-
eraged probability distribution P(I) and its integral N(I)

were then calculated. Figure 14 shows the resulting nu-
merically determined values of N(I) for 10I0 ≤I ≤16I0,
along with the straight line behavior predicted by equa-
tion (13). One ﬁnds that there is good agreement for large
intensities, as expected. For smaller intensities, the curve
departs from the straight line and rises faster. This is in
part due to the deformation of the contours due to the
fourth (and higher) order terms which break the rota-
tional invariance. It is interesting to note that for an op-
tical potential with decagonal symmetry but not of the
standing wave type we consider here, the probability dis-
tribution of peak heights was found to be a power law,
P(I) ∼(I/Im)−3/4 [17].
6.2 Onsite potentials for diﬀerent families of sites
We next discuss the onsite potential, as a function of the
type of site. As was seen in Section 5, each of the fami-
lies of sites A, B, . . . corresponds to a domain in P ′. The
points near the origin, which correspond to A sites of the
OT, have large values of the intensity, and the intensity

diminishes as one goes to the B, C, . . ., out to the F sites.
Thus, the peak intensity is decreasing as one goes from
z = 8 (A sites) down to z = 3 (F sites). In other words,
the z = 8 sites are located in the deepest potential wells.
This statement applies to the mean value of I for each
class of sites, while the actual value for a given site will
lie within a certain interval around the mean value. Fig-
ure 15 shows the spread of values of the local intensity
corresponding to each value of z. The maximum and min-
imum values of the potential were calculated based on the
perpendicular space dependence of the intensity shown in
Figure 13 using the domains shown in Figure 10. This in-
terval grows as z is reduced: the distribution is narrow
for A sites, and gets fairly broad for the E and F sites.
Twin-pairs, as deﬁned in Section 5 are pairs of sites
which are close together in real space. In P ′, they are at
opposite ends the selection window, such that their dis-
tances from the origin r′ are very similar. Since the in-
tensity is a smooth function of r′, the diﬀerence of peak
intensity between two twin F sites will therefore be small.
As a consequence of this property, a small repulsive inter-
action between particles should be suﬃcient to raise the
energy of a twin-pair, making it energetically unfavorable.
Conversely, it would become favorable to occupy empty
hexagons and octagons, since the empty site in their cen-
ters corresponds to an intensity which is just below the
cutoﬀ. Thus, in conclusion, small repulsive interactions
should induce a transformation of the OQ into the OT.
This is an interesting possibility, since there is a large
body of work devoted to studying models of electronic
and vibrational properties of the OT [18–26].
6.3 Intensity variations between sites
We examine in the section the problem of the behavior of
I(⃗r) between two adjacent sites in the optical quasicrystal.
This information is relevant, for example, in discussions of
the tunnelling probability between adjacent sites. A priori,
it is clear that the variations of the intensity should be
diﬀerent for each pair of sites in the quasicrystal. However,
one can ﬁnd a close similarity of behavior for diﬀerent
types of pairs, depending on their relative positions in the
4D lattice. We describe below the typical intensity proﬁles
for two types of nearest neighbors in a qualitative fashion,
leaving a more complete study for a future work. The two
kinds of pairs are (i) edge-linked pairs where the distance
between sites is ℓ(the edge length) and (ii) small-diagonal
pairs where the distance between the pair is the length of
a small diagonal of the 45◦rhombus, ℓ

2 −
√
2.
The simplest case is that of the densest theoretical
structure, the p = 0 optical quasicrystal (not realizable
using the intensity cut-oﬀmethod).
(i)
Edge-linked pairs. Moving from site i to site j corre-
sponds, in 4D space, to going along a body diagonal.
The function I must have at least one zero along this
path, since the amplitude 4
n=1 cos(⃗k′
n.⃗r ′) changes
from −4 to +4. After projecting into the physical
plane P,the intensity would go from a local maxi-
mum, through zero, and back up to a local maximum.
(ii)
Small-diagonal pairs. Moving from site i to site j
corresponds, in 4D space, to going along an edge of
the 4D hypercube. The intensity would evolve from
a local maximum to another local maximum without
passing through zero in between.
We now consider the physically relevant p = 1 OQ,
where neighboring sites are spaced further apart and be-
long in diﬀerent unit cells in 4D. This leads to inten-
sity variations which have a more complicated dependence
upon distance. There are additional maxima and minima
between the start and ﬁnish, compared to the simple case
discussed above. However there is still a strong similarity
between the curves obtained for each of the two cases (i)
sites joined by an edge and (ii) sites lying across the small
diagonal. This is now shown by numerical computation,
for the case of the optical quasicrystal obtained by im-
posing the cutoﬀvalue Ic = 11. For pairs joined by an
edge, results are shown in Figure 16a, where the variation
of the intensity I(d) is plotted as a function of the dis-
tance along the edge d for a large number of pairs. The
curves are individually distinct, however they show sim-
ilar qualitative behavior. A similar set of computations
was carried out for sites separated by a short diagonal,
with the results shown in Figure 16b. These plots indicate
that the intensity proﬁle is determined by the type of pair
(joined along an edge or along the small diagonal) to ﬁrst
approximation. One can expect therefore the tunnelling
amplitude between sites should be approximately of the
same order of magnitude for pairs of a given type. A de-
tailed quantitative study to check this statement about
the intensity proﬁles for the optical quasicrystal is left for
future calculations.
7 Discussion and conclusions
We have discussed how to obtain an optical quasicrystal
with eight-fold symmetry by trapping particles in a laser
potential generated by four lasers. By varying tempera-
ture for a ﬁxed laser intensity I0 or by varying the laser

intensity at ﬁxed temperature, one can obtain structures
which are closely related to the standard octagonal tiling,
whose properties have been investigated by many authors.
The optical quasicrystal can be made to transform into
the octagonal tiling by increasing repulsive interactions
between particles. The densest optical quasicrystal has an
edge length of the order of the laser wavelength, while the
inﬁnite series of inﬂated tilings can be obtained in prin-
ciple by decreasing the number of particles and increas-
ing the laser intensity. We presented a four dimensional
model and derived the relation between the quasi lattice
vectors and the laser wavelength. The model also allows
us to calculate the distribution of peak heights analyti-
cally for large intensities. We also give the typical values
and the widths of the distribution of peak intensities for
diﬀerent families of sites of the optical quasicrystal and
we discussed the form of the intensity variations between
pairs of sites. This information is relevant to experimental
realizations and for numerical studies of such systems.
It should be noted that quasicrystals made by trap-
ping colloidal particles (typically of nm size) have been
studied, for example in the context of melting and phase
transitions, as in reference [27]. However, the optical po-
tential there is a superposition of travelling, rather than
standing, waves, and our model is not applicable in that
case. The method described here to obtain an 8-fold qua-
sicrystal can be readily generalized to describe systems
with 5-fold and 10-fold symmetry. The optical quasicrystal
presented here, due to its conceptual simplicity, and the
numerous experimental tuning parameters that one can
use, is an excellent candidate to study the physical prop-
erties of quasicrystals. Cold atom quasicrystals, in partic-
ular, would allow to study the eﬀects of quasiperiodicity
on the quantum diﬀusion of wave packets, and on a vari-
ety of transport properties. They oﬀer a new solution to
the long-standing problem of experimentally creating and
studying single-component quasicrystals.
Appendix: 8-fold symmetry of the 4D
cubic lattices
In this Appendix, we review brieﬂy some properties relat-
ing to 8-fold symmetry, namely, invariance under rotations
by 2π/n with n = 8. The octagonal group C8v has 16 ele-
ments: In 2 dimensions, the 8-fold generator is a rotation
g of π
4 or g′ of
3π
4 , giving rise to inequivalent represen-
tations of the group. The remaining elements are vertical
“mirror” planes which make two conjugation classes. As is
well-known, an 8-fold rotational symmetry is not compat-
ible with the translation invariance of a 2D lattice since
the trace tr(g) =
√
2 is not an integer as it should be if the
matrix of g could be written in the basis of an invariant
lattice. However, the group C8v has crystallographic rep-
resentations in 4D, as we will now explain in more detail.
Generators of this representation are an 8-fold element γ
which we choose as:
γ =
⎡
⎢⎣
0 0 0 −1
1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 1 0
⎤
⎥⎦

(A.2)
They satisfy the following relationships: γ8 = I, σ2 = I
and σγσ = γ−1. All elements of the group are of the form
γk or σγk for 0 ≤k < 8, the latter are symmetries of or-
der 2. As can be checked readily, the hypercubic 4D lattice
Z4 is invariant under transformation by these matrices and
consequently under the whole group. This representation
of C8v is reducible: the 4D space R4 splits into the planes
P and P ′ deﬁned above which are invariant and carry
inequivalent irreducible representations of the group. The
orthogonal projections onto P and P ′ are π and π′ = I−π
with
π = 1

The restriction of γ to P is the rotation g of angle

whereas the restriction to P ′ is the rotation g′ of angle 3π

We next turn to the body centered lattice B. The
vertices of B can be written as ⃗R = T⃗n =  jnβn

Page 10 of 10
Eur. Phys. J. B (2014) 87: 149
with ⃗n = (n1, n2, n3, n4) (where the ni are integers) and
where T is the matrix
T = 1

A basis of B is given by the vectors ⃗βn = T⃗εn (n =
1, . . . , 4). One can check that det(T ) =
1
2 and that
T.C8v = C8v.T so that B is invariant with respect to C8v
and belongs to the same Bravais class as the hypercubic
lattice Z4.
We now discuss the indexation of peak positions us-
ing the BCC lattice points. When Ic tends to 16I0, the
acceptance domains associated with each of the BCC lat-
tice points shrink and their shapes tend to spheres, while
their projections on P (or P ′) tend to disks Dj (or D′
j) of
radius ρ. If such a domain Δj cuts the plane P, the local
maximum of I occurs at a point ⃗sj = (x, y) which con-
verges to the projection ⃗rj of ⃗Rj in the limit Ic →16. The
4D coordinates of ⃗sj are given by the coordinate transfor-
mation ⃗Sj = Rt(x, y, 0, 0). ⃗Sj belongs to P and is close to
the lattice point ⃗Rj, so that ⃗Sj ≈
√
2π
k T⃗j. Thus, if Ic is
large enough, the local maxima of I in the domain I > Ic
can be indexed by lattice points of the BCC lattice.
