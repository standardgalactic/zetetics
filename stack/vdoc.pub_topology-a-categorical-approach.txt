Preface
When teaching a graduate topology course, it’s tempting to rush through the point-set
topology, or even skip it altogether, and do more algebraic topology, which is more fun
to teach and more relevant to today’s students. Many point-set topology ideas are already
familiar to students from real analysis or undergraduate point-set topology courses and
may seem safe to skip. Also, point-set ideas that might be unfamiliar but important in
other subjects, say the Zariski topology in algebraic geometry or the p-adic topology in
number theory, can be picked up later when they are encountered in context.
An alternative to rushing through point-set topology is to cover it from a more modern,
categorical point of view. We think this alternative is better for several reasons. Since
many students are familiar with point-set ideas already, they are in a good position to learn
something new about these ideas, like the universal properties characterizing them. Plus,
using categorical methods to handle point-set topology, whose name even suggests an old-
fashioned way of thinking of spaces, demonstrates the power and versatility of the methods.
The category of topological spaces is poorly behaved in some respects, but this provides
opportunities to draw meaningful contrasts between topology and other subjects and to
give good reasons why some kinds of spaces (like compactly generated weakly Hausdorff
spaces) enjoy particular prevalence. Finally, there is the practicality that point-set topology
is on the syllabus for our ﬁrst-year topology courses and PhD exams. Teaching the material
in a way that both deepens understanding and prepares a solid foundation for future work
in modern mathematics is an excellent alternative.
This text contains material curated from many resources to present elementary topology
from a categorical perspective. In particular, we cover some of the same topics as Ronnie
Brown (2006), although our outlook is, from the outset, more categorical. The result is
intentionally less comprehensive but more widely useful. We assume that students know
linear algebra well and have had at least enough abstract algebra to understand how to
form the quotient of a group by a normal subgroup. Students should also have some basic
knowledge about how to work with sets and their elements, even as they endeavor to work
with arrows instead. Students encountering diagrams and arrows for the ﬁrst time may

want to spend a little extra time reading the preliminaries where the objects (sets) are
presumably familiar but the perspective may be new.
Covering spaces, homology, and cohomology are not in this book, but students will be
ready to learn more algebraic topology after reading through our text. The omitted top-
ics are likely included in whichever algebraic topology book is used afterward, including
Massey (1991), Rotman (1998), May (1999), Hatcher (2002), and tom Dieck (2008), for
which the reader will be well prepared. When we teach the ﬁrst semester topology course
in our PhD program, we usually cover the classiﬁcation of compact surfaces. While this
classiﬁcation theorem is not in the text, an instructor may wish to cover it in their course,
and it is hard to beat Conway’s ZIP proof or the proof in Massey (1991).
With detailed descriptions of topological constructions emphasizing universal proper-
ties; ﬁlter-based treatment of convergence; thorough discussions of limits, colimits, and
adjunctions; and an early emphasis on homotopy, this book guides the student of topology
through the important transition from an undergraduate with a solid background in analysis
or point-set topology to a graduate student preparing to work on problems in contemporary
mathematics.

Preliminaries
I argue that set theory should not be based on membership, as in Zermelo-Frankel set theory, but
rather on isomorphism-invariant structure.

Introduction.
Traditionally, the ﬁrst chapter of a textbook on mathematics begins by recalling
basic notions from set theory. This chapter begins by introducing basic notions from category the-
ory, the shift being from the internal anatomy of sets to their relationships with other sets. The
idea of focusing on the relationships between mathematical objects, rather than on their internals,
is fundamental to modern mathematics, and category theory is the framework for working from
this perspective. Our goal for chapter 0 is to present what is perhaps familiar to you—functions,
sets, topological spaces—from the contemporary perspective of category theory. Notably, category
theory originated in topology in the 1940s with work of Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders MacLane
(Eilenberg and MacLane, 1945).
This chapter’s material is organized into three sections. Section 0.1 begins with a quick review of
topological spaces, bases, and continuous functions. Motivated by a few key features of topological
spaces and continuous functions, we’ll proceed to section 0.2 and introduce three basic concepts of
category theory: categories, functors, and natural transformations. The same section highlights one
of the main philosophies of category theory, namely that studying a mathematical object is akin to
studying its relationships to other objects. This golden thread starts in section 0.2 and weaves its way
through the remaining pages of the book—we encourage you to keep an eye out for the occasional
glimmer. Finally, equipped with the categorical mindset, we’ll revisit some familiar ideas from basic
set theory in section 0.3.
0.1
Basic Topology
Deﬁnition 0.1 A topological space (X, T ) consists of a set X and a collection T of subsets
of X that satisfy the following properties:
(i)
The empty set ∅and X are in T .
(ii)
Any union of elements in T is also in T .
(iii)
Any ﬁnite intersection of elements in T is also in T .

2
Chapter 0
The collection T is called a topology on X, and we’ll write X in place of (X, T ) if the
topology is understood. Occasionally, we’ll also refer to the topological space X as simply
a space. Elements of the topology T are called open sets, and a set is called closed if and
only if its complement is open.
Example 0.1 Suppose X is any set. The collection 2X of all subsets of X forms a topology
called the discrete topology on X, and the set {∅, X} forms a topology on X called the
indiscrete topology or the trivial topology.
Sometimes, two topologies on the same set are comparable. When T ⊆T ′, the topology
T can be called coarser than T ′, or the topology T ′ can be called ﬁner than T . Instead of
coarser and ﬁner, some people say “smaller and larger” or “weaker and stronger,” but the
terminology becomes clearer—as with most things in life—with coffee. A coarse grind
yields a small number of chunky coffee pieces, whereas a ﬁne grind results in a large
number of tiny coffee pieces. Finely ground beans make stronger coffee; coarsely ground
beans make weaker coffee.
In practice, it can be easier to work with a small collection of open subsets of X that
generates the topology.
Deﬁnition 0.2 A collection B of subsets of a set X is a basis for a topology on X if and
only if
(i)
For each x ∈X there is a B ∈B such that x ∈B.
(ii)
If x ∈A∩B where A, B ∈B, then there is at least one C ∈B such that x ∈C ⊆A∩B.
The topology T generated by the basis B is deﬁned to be the coarsest topology containing
B. Equivalently, a set U ⊆X is open in the topology generated by the basis B if and only
if for every x ∈U there is a B ∈B such that x ∈B ⊆U.
We call the collection of B ∈B with x ∈B the basic open neighborhoods of x. More
generally, in any topology T , those U ∈T containing x are called open neighborhoods of
x and together are denoted Tx.
Example 0.2 A metric space is a pair (X, d) where X is a set and d: X × X →R is a
function satisfying
• d(x, y) ≥0 for all x, y ∈X,
• d(x, y) = d(y, x) for all x, y ∈X,
• d(x, y) + d(y, z) ≥d(x, z) for all x, y, z ∈X,
• d(x, y) = 0 if and only if x = y for all x, y ∈X.
The function d is called a metric or a distance function. If (X, d) is a metric space, x ∈X,
and r > 0, then the ball centered at x of radius r is deﬁned to be
B(x, r) = {y ∈X | d(x, y) < r} .

Preliminaries
3
The balls {B(x, r)} form a basis for a topology on X called the metric topology. So any
set with a metric gives rise to a topological space. On the other hand, if Y is a space with
topology T and if there is a metric d on Y such that the metric topology is the same as T ,
then Y is said to be metrizable.
Any subset of a metric space is a metric space. In particular, subsets of Rn provide numer-
ous examples of topological spaces since Rn with the usual Euclidean distance function is
a metric space. For example,
• the real line R,
• the unit interval I := [0, 1],
• the closed unit ball Dn := {(x1, . . . , xn) ∈Rn | x2
1 + · · · + x2
n ≤1}, and
• the n-sphere S n := {(x1, . . . , xn+1) ∈Rn+1 | x2
1 + · · · + x2
n+1 = 1}
are all important topological spaces.
We’ll see more examples of topological spaces in chapter 1 and will discuss some im-
portant features in chapter 2. One way we’ll glean information is by studying how spaces
relate to each other. These relationships are best understood as functions that interact
nicely—in the sense of the following deﬁnition—with open subsets of the spaces.
Deﬁnition 0.3 A function f : X →Y between two topological spaces is continuous if and
only if f −1U is open in X whenever U is open in Y.
It is straightforward to check that for any topological space X, the identity idX : X →X is
continuous, and for any topological spaces X, Y, Z and any continuous functions f : X →Y
and g: Y →Z, the composition g f := g ◦f : X →Z is continuous, and moreover that
this composition is associative. On the surface, these observations may appear to be ho-
hum, but quite the opposite is true. Collectively, the seemingly routine observations above
amount to the statement that topological spaces together with continuous functions form a
category.
0.2
Basic Category Theory
In this section, we’ll give the formal deﬁnition of a category along with several examples.
0.2.1
Categories
Deﬁnition 0.4 A category C consists of the following data:
(i)
a class of objects,

4
Chapter 0
(ii)
for every two objects X, Y, a set1 C(X, Y) whose elements are called morphisms and
denoted by arrows; for example f : X →Y,
(iii)
a composition rule deﬁned for morphisms: if f : X →Y and g: Y →Z, then there
is a morphism g f : X →Z.
These data must satisfy the following two conditions:
(i)
Composition is associative. That is, if h: X →Y, g: Y →Z, f : Z →W, then
f(gh) = (fg)h.
(ii)
There exist identity morphisms. That is, for every object X, there exists a morphism
idX : X →X with the property that f idX = f = idY f whenever f is a morphism
from X to Y. By the usual argument, identity morphisms are unique: if id′
X : X →X
is another identity morphism, then id′
X = id′
X idX = idX .
The associativity condition can also be expressed by way of a commutative diagram. A
diagram can be thought of as a directed graph with morphisms as edges and with objects
as vertices, though we’ll give a more categorical deﬁnition in chapter 4. A diagram is said
to commute (or is commutative) if all paths that share the same initial and ﬁnal vertex are
the same. For example, if h: X →Y and g: Y →Z are composable morphisms, then there
is a commutative diagram:
X
Y
Z
h
gh
g
And if f : Z →W is a third morphism, then the property, “composition is associative,”—
that is, f(gh) = (fg)h—is equivalent to the statement that the following diagram com-
mutes:
X
Y
Z
W
gh
h
g
fg
f
Simply put, a diagram is a visualization of morphism composition. A commutative dia-
gram is a visualization of equalities between compositions. We’ll see many more examples
1 Some authors denote the set of morphisms from X to Y by homC(X, Y) or simply hom(X, Y) if the category C is
understood. Since keeping track of subscripts can be a chore, we’ll usually promote the subscript to the forefront
and write C(X, Y). While this notation may take some getting used to, we encourage the reader to do so. Authors
also differ in their deﬁnitions of “category.” We require a category to have only a set’s worth of morphisms
between any two objects—a property known as being locally small. Others sometimes allow categories to have
more arrows.

in the pages to come. And speaking of examples, we already mentioned that topological
spaces with continuous functions form a category. Here is another.
Example 0.3 For any given ﬁeld k, there is a category denoted Vectk whose objects
V, W, . . . are vector spaces over k and whose morphisms are linear transformations. To
verify the claim, suppose T : V →W and S : W →U are linear transformations. Then for
any v, v′ ∈V and any k ∈k,
S T(kv + v′) = S (kTv + Tv′) = kS Tv + S Tv′
and so S T : V →U is indeed a linear transformation. Associativity of composition is
automatic since linear transformations are functions and composition of functions is always
associative. And for any vector space, the identity function is a linear transformation. More
generally, modules over a ﬁxed ring R together with R-module homomorphisms form a
category, RMod.
Here are a few more examples. This time we’ll leave the veriﬁcations as an exercise.
• Set: The objects are sets, the morphisms are functions, and composition is composi-
tion of functions.
• Set∗: The objects are sets S having a distinguished element. (Such sets are called
pointed sets.) A morphism f : S →T is a function satisfying f s0 = t0 whenever s0
is the distinguished element of S and t0 is the distinguished element of T. (Such func-
tions are said to “respect” the distinguished elements.) Composition is composition of
functions.
• Top: The objects are topological spaces, the morphisms are continuous functions, and
composition is composition of functions.
• Top∗: The objects are topological spaces with a distinguished point, often called a
basepoint. (Such spaces are called pointed or based spaces.) The morphisms are
continuous functions that map basepoint to basepoint, and composition is composition
of functions.
• hTop: The objects are topological spaces, the morphisms are homotopy classes of
continuous functions, and composition is composition of these homotopy classes. The
notion of homotopy will be introduced in section 1.6.
• Grp: The objects are groups, the morphisms are group homomorphisms, and compo-
sition is composition of homomorphisms.
• Every group G can be viewed as a category with one object • and with a morphism
g: • →• for each group element g. The composition of two morphisms f, g corre-
sponds to the group element g f.

• A directed multigraph determines a category whose objects are the vertices and whose
morphisms are the directed paths along ﬁnitely many arrows joined head-to-tail.2 For
example, the directed graph

· · ·
determines a category that will make an appearance in example 4.1. For simple graphs,
one might want to display more information by drawing identities and composite mor-
phisms. To avoid confusion, one can state whether identities and composites are dis-
played. Here, of course, they are not drawn. This example also illustrates another
notational convenience: we’ll frequently use symbols such as • and ◦as anonymous
placeholders. So unless otherwise indicated, each “•” should be considered a distinct
object.
• For any category C, there is an opposite category Cop. The objects are the same as
the objects of C, but the morphisms are reversed. Composition in Cop is deﬁned by
composition in C, that is, Cop(X, Y) = C(Y, X). To check that composition makes
sense, suppose f ∈Cop(X, Y) and g ∈Cop(Y, Z) so that f : Y →X and g: Z →Y.
Then fg: Z →X and therefore fg ∈Cop(X, Z) as needed.
Category theory is an appropriate setting in which to discuss an age-old question: “When
are two objects really the same?” The concept of “sameness” being a special kind of re-
lationship means that objects are the same if there is a particular morphism—an isomor-
phism—between them. How we talk about sameness is at the heart of category theory. We
take Wittgenstein’s (1922) critique,
Roughly speaking, to say of two things that they are identical is nonsense, and to say of
one thing that it is identical with itself is to say nothing at all
as an invitation to ask for less, namely isomorphic (or uniquely isomorphic) objects, rather
than identical objects.
Deﬁnition 0.5 Let X and Y be objects in any category, and suppose f : X →Y.
(i)
f is left invertible if and only if there exists a morphism g: Y →X so that g f = idX.
The morphism g is called a left inverse of f.
(ii)
f is right invertible if and only if there exists a morphism h: Y →X so that fh = idY.
The morphism h is called a right inverse of f.
In the case when f has both a left inverse g and a right inverse h, then
g = g idY = g fh = idX h = h
and the single morphism g = h is called the inverse of f. (We encourage you to verify our
use of “the.” If f has an inverse, it is unique.) Therefore
2 Including—for each object—a unique path of length zero starting and ending at that object.

Preliminaries

(iii)
f is invertible and is said to be an isomorphism if it is both left and right invertible.
Two objects X and Y are isomorphic, denoted X  Y, if there exists an isomorphism
f : X →Y.
The notion of being isomorphic is a form of equivalence, meaning it is reﬂexive, sym-
metric, and transitive—properties you should check. Isomorphic objects, therefore, form
equivalence classes. Some categories have their own special terminology for both isomor-
phism and these isomorphism classes. For instance,
• Isomorphisms in Set are called bijections, and two isomorphic sets are said to have
the same cardinality. A cardinal is an isomorphism class of sets.
• Isomorphisms in Top are called homeomorphisms, and two isomorphic spaces are said
to be homeomorphic.
• Isomorphisms in hTop are called homotopy equivalences, and isomorphic spaces in
hTop are said to be homotopic. (See section 1.6 for a discussion of homotopy.)
Mathematics is particularly concerned with properties that are preserved under isomor-
phisms in a given category. For instance, topology is essentially the study of properties
that are preserved under homeomorphisms. Such properties are referred to as topological
properties and distinguish spaces: if X and Y are homeomorphic and X has (or doesn’t
have) a certain property, then Y must have (or cannot have) that property, too.
Example 0.4 The cardinality of a topological space is a topological property since any
homeomorphism f : X →Y is necessarily a bijective function, and so X and Y, when
viewed as sets, must have the same cardinality. Metrizability is also a topological prop-
erty. Connectedness (section 2.1), compactness (section 2.3), Hausdorff (section 2.2), ﬁrst
countability (section 3.2), . . . are examples of other topological properties that will be dis-
cussed in the indicated sections.
However, not every familiar property is a topological one.
Example 0.5 A metric space is called complete if every Cauchy sequence converges. Be-
ing a complete metric space is not a topological property. For instance, the map (−1, 1) →
R by x 7→
x
(1−x2) is a homeomorphism, yet R is a complete metric space while (−1, 1) is not.
This example also shows that being bounded is also not a topological property: a metric
space is said to be bounded if the metric is a bounded function. Clearly, (−1, 1) is bounded
while R is not.
Comparing an object X with another object can help us to understand X better. Taking this
idea further, we may also compare X with all objects at once. In other words, we can learn
a great deal of information about X by looking at all morphisms both out of and in to X.
This is the content of the next theorem. In essence, it states that the isomorphism class of
an object is completely determined by morphisms to and from it. This is one of the main
maxims of category theory:

8
Chapter 0
an object is completely determined by its relationships with other objects.
In fact, it’s a corollary of a major result to be discussed in section 0.2.3. But before we
state the theorem formally, here is some useful terminology.
Deﬁnition 0.6 For each morphism f : X →Y and object Z in a category, there is a map
of sets f∗: C(Z, X) →C(Z, Y) called the pushforward of f deﬁned by postcomposition
f∗: g 7→fg.
C(Z, X)
C(Z, Y)
X
Y
Z
f∗
f
g
f∗(g):= fg
There is also a map of sets f ∗: C(Y, Z) →C(X, Z) called the pullback deﬁned by precom-
position f ∗: g 7→g f.
C(X, Z)
C(Y, Z)
X
Y
Z
f ∗
f
f ∗(g):=g f
g
The reason for the visual names pushforward and pullback is hopefully clear from the
diagrams above. With this terminology in hand, here is the theorem whose summary we
provided above.
Theorem 0.1 The following are equivalent.
• f : X →Y is an isomorphism.
• For every object Z, the pushforward f∗: C(Z, X) →C(Z, Y) is an isomorphism of sets.
• For every object Z, the pullback f ∗: C(Y, Z) →C(X, Z) is an isomorphism of sets.
Proof. We’ll prove that a morphism f : X →Y is an isomorphism if and only if for every
object Z, the pushforward f∗: C(Z, X) →C(Z, Y) is an isomorphism of sets; then, we’ll
leave the other statements as exercises.
Suppose f : X →Y is an isomorphism. Let g: Y →X be the inverse of f. Then for any
Z, the map g∗: C(Z, Y) →C(Z, X) is the inverse of f∗.
Conversely, suppose that for any Z, the map f∗: C(Z, X) →C(Z, Y) is an isomorphism
of sets. Choosing Z = Y, we have f∗: C(Y, X)
−→C(Y, Y), so in particular f∗is surjective.
Therefore there exists a morphism g: Y →X so that f∗g = idY, which by deﬁnition implies
fg = idY. To see that g f = idX, consider the case Z = X. We know f∗: C(X, X)
−→C(X, Y),

Preliminaries
9
so in particular f∗is injective. And since f∗(idX) = f and f∗(g f) = fg f = f, injectivity of
f∗implies idX = g f as needed.
In summary, if you understand all the morphisms X →Z, then you know X up to iso-
morphism. Or if you understand all the morphisms Z →X, then you know X up to
isomorphism.
Now it turns out that categories themselves are objects worthy of study. And as per our
maxim above, studying a category should amount to studying its relationships to other
categories. But what is a relationship between categories? It is called a functor. That is the
subject of the next section.
You might wonder if we are about to construct a category of categories where the objects
are categories and the morphisms are functors. This can be done, but there are a few impor-
tant considerations. One consideration is size. When we deﬁned categories, we assumed
that for any two objects X and Y, there is a set of morphisms C(X, Y). This is convenient
so that, as in the case of the pushforward f∗: C(Z, X) →C(Z, Y) of a morphism f : X →Y
in the previous theorem, we can consider functions between sets of morphisms. However,
if C and D are categories, then there may be more than a set’s worth of functors C →D.
There’s also another, more subtle consideration to think about: The sharpest identiﬁcation
of an object generally available when doing category is up to unique isomorphism. This
should apply to the morphisms between categories as well. It can be dizzying, but the
takeaway is that invertible functors provide a notion of equivalence that’s too rigid to be
useful. So instead of an “isomorphism of categories,” we talk about an “equivalence of
categories,” which is deﬁned in a more subtle way. A third consideration is that one might
want to remember that categories themselves have objects and morphisms, and the cate-
gory of categories has more structure than a category—it’s probably better to think of it as
a “higher” category, a concept we won’t stop to discuss here.
0.2.2
Functors
Deﬁnition 0.7 A functor F from a category C to a category D consists of the following
data:
(i)
An object FX of the category D for each object X in the category C,
(ii)
A morphism F f : FX →FY for every morphism f : X →Y.
These data must be compatible with composition and identity morphisms in the following
sense:
(iii)
(Fg)(F f) = F(g f) for any morphisms f : X →Y and g: Y →Z,
(iv)
F idX = idFX for any object X.
A functor as deﬁned above is sometimes described as a covariant functor to distinguish it
from its contravariant counterpart. A functor F : Cop →D whose domain is the opposite
category is called a contravariant functor from C to D. Contravariant functors “reverse

10
Chapter 0
arrows.” That is, for every morphism f : X →Y, the functor F : Cop →D assigns a
morphism F f : FY →FX. We sometimes abuse terminology and refer to a contravariant
functor simply as a functor. This usually doesn’t cause confusion since the direction of the
arrows can often be worked out easily.
Example 0.6 Here are some examples of functors.
• For an object X in a category C, there is a functor C(X, −) from C to Set that assigns
to each object Z the set C(X, Z) and to each morphism f : Y →Z the pushforward f∗
of f as in deﬁnition 0.6.

• For an object X in a category C, there is a functor C(−, X) from Cop to Set that assigns
to each object Z the set C(Z, X) and to each morphism f : Y →Z the pullback f ∗of f
as in deﬁnition 0.6.
Y
C(Y, X)
Z
C(Z, X)

• Fix a set X. There is a functor X × −from Set to Set deﬁned on objects by Y 7→X × Y
and on morphisms f by id ×f. As we’ll see in example 5.1, the functors X × −and
C(X, −) form a special pair called the product-hom adjunction.
• Fix a vector space V over a ﬁeld k. There is a functor V ⊗−from Vectk to Vectk
deﬁned on objects by W 7→V ⊗W and on morphisms by f 7→id ⊗f.
• There is a forgetful functor, usually denoted U for “underlying,” from Grp to Set that
forgets the group operation. Concretely, it sends a group G to its underlying set UG
and a group homomorphism to its underlying function.
• There is a free functor F from Set to Grp that assigns the free group FS to the set S .
The free and forgetful functors form a special pair called the free-forgetful adjunction.
We’ll expand on this in section 5.2.
• There are other “forgetful” functors besides the one that forgets the group operation.
Any functor that forgets structure, such as the U : Top →Set that forgets the topology,
may be referred to as a forgetful functor.
• The fundamental group, to be discussed in detail in chapter 6, deﬁnes a functor π1
from Top∗to Grp.
• The construction of the Grothendieck group of a commutative monoid is functorial.
That is, there is a “Grothendieck group” functor from the category of commutative

Preliminaries
11
monoids to the category of commutative groups that constructs a group from a com-
mutative monoid by attaching inverses.
Here are a few different kinds of functors.
Deﬁnition 0.8 Let F be a functor from a category C to a category D. If for all objects X
and Y in C, the map
C(X, Y) →D(FX, FY)
given by
f 7→F f
(i)
is injective, then F is called faithful;
(ii)
is surjective, then F is called full;
(iii)
is bijective, then F is called fully faithful.
Fully faithful functors preserve all relationships among objects of the domain category:
F is fully faithful if and only if each FX →FY is the image of exactly one morphism
X →Y. Think of it as an embedding, so to speak, of one category into another. But note,
a fully faithful functor need not be injective on objects, so we use the term “embedding”
loosely here. A fully faithful functor that is injective on objects is called a full embedding.
We’ll deﬁne one of category theory’s most famous fully faithful functors in the following
section, but ﬁrst we emphasize an important utility of functors. A functor F : C →D
encodes invariants of isomorphism classes of objects within C. This is a fundamental
idea, arising from the fact that functors take compositions to compositions and identities
to identities. Consequentially,
functors take isomorphisms to isomorphisms.
So if two objects X and Y are “the same” in C, then FX and FY must be “the same” in D,
the contrapositive being just as useful. For instance, the value that any functor Top →C
assigns to a topological space is automatically a topological property (or we might say a
topological invariant). So the question arises, “What is a useful choice of category C?” If
we choose C to be an algebraic category, then we enter into the realm of algebraic topology.
A homology theory, for example, is a functor H : Top →RMod and is an excellent means
of distinguishing topological spaces: if HX and HY are not isomorphic R-modules, then X
and Y are not isomorphic spaces.
Having adopted the perspective that functors are invariants, it’s natural to wonder: “When
are two invariants the same?” To answer this, one needs a way to compare functors.
0.2.3
Natural Transformations and the Yoneda Lemma
Deﬁnition 0.9 Let F and G be functors C →D. A natural transformation η from F to G
consists of a morphism ηX : FX →GX for each object X in C. Moreover, these morphisms
in D must satisfy the property that ηYF f = G fηX for every morphism f : X →Y in C. In

For any two functors F,G: C →D, let Nat(F,G) denote the natural transformations from
F to G. If ηX : FX
−→GX is an isomorphism for each X, then η is called a natural
isomorphism or a natural equivalence, and we say F and G are naturally isomorphic,
denoted F  G.
Keep in mind that a natural transformation η is the totality of all the morphisms ηX, and
each ηX can be thought of as a component, so to speak, of η. Simply put, a natural trans-
formation is a collection of maps from one diagram to another, and these maps are special
in that they commute with all the arrows in the diagrams.3
The language of natural transformations not only provides us an avenue in which com-
paring invariants (functors) becomes possible, but it also prompts us to revisit an idea
mentioned in section 0.2.1. There we introduced the categorical philosophy that studying
a mathematical object is more of a global, as opposed to a local, endeavor. That is, we can
paint a better—rather, a complete—picture of an object once we investigate its interactions
with all other objects. This theme ﬁnds its origins in an—if not the most—important result
in category theory.
Yoneda Lemma
For every object X in C and for every functor F : Cop →Set, the set of
natural transformations from C(−, X) to F is isomorphic to FX,
Nat(C(−, X), F)  FX
In other words, elements of the set FX are in bijection with natural transformations from
C(−, X) to F. We omit the proof but take note of the special case when F = C(−, Y):
Nat(C(−, X), C(−, Y))  C(X, Y)
(0.1)
It’s closely related to theorem 0.1 in the following way.
First observe that given two categories C and D, we can form a new category DC whose
objects are functors C →D and whose morphisms are natural transformations. To ensure
that DC is locally small, we may require C to be small and D to be locally small. When
considering contravariant functors and taking D = Set, we obtain the category SetCop. An
object here is called a presheaf. This is a very nice category—it has all ﬁnite limits and
3 So a natural transformation may be viewed simultaneously as a single arrow between two functors or as a
collection of arrows between two diagrams. Therefore you might hope that diagrams can be viewed as functors.
As we will see in section 4.1, this is indeed the case.

colimits (to be discussed in chapter 4), it is Cartesian closed, and it forms what’s called
a topos. We won’t dwell on these properties, though. Instead we turn our attention to a
special functor y: C →SetCop. It’s deﬁned by sending an object X to the presheaf C(−, X)
and a morphism f : X →Y to the natural transformation f∗,
X
C(−, X)
Y
C(−, Y)
f
f∗
This is a slight abuse of notation, though. By f∗: C(−, X) →C(−, Y) we mean the natural
transformation whose component morphisms are the pushforward of f.
The isomorphism in (0.1) shows that the functor y is fully faithful and therefore embeds
C into the functor category SetCop. For this reason, y is called the Yoneda embedding. The
punchline is that each object X in C can be viewed as the contravariant functor C(−, X).
Practically speaking, this means information about X can be obtained by studying the set
of all morphisms in to it. But what about morphisms out of it?
There is a version of the Yoneda lemma for covariant functors (called co-presheaves) in
the category SetC and, accordingly, a contravariant Yoneda embedding Cop →SetC. The
corresponding result is that X can also be viewed as a functor C(X, −). So the moral of the
story is that if you understand maps in and out of X, then you understand X. Thus we’ve
come full circle to the theme introduced in section 0.2.1:
objects are completely determined by their relationships with other objects.
The adjective “completely” is justiﬁed by the following important corollary of the Yoneda
lemma:
X  Y
if and only if
C(−, X)  C(−, Y).
One direction follows from the fact that the Yoneda embedding is a functor. The other
direction follows from the fact that it is fully faithful. It’s also true that X  Y if and only if
C(X, −)  C(Y, −), as can be veriﬁed by considering the contravariant Yoneda embedding.
And with that, we’ve just provided a restatement of theorem 0.1.
As a ﬁnal remark, at times we’ll adapt this philosophy and use it to consider just a
few (and not necessarily all) morphisms to or from an object—this also yields fruitful
information.
Example 0.7 Two sets X and Y are isomorphic if and only if Set(Z, X)  Set(Z, Y) for
all sets Z. That is, X and Y are the same if and only if they relate to all other sets in the
same way. But this is overkill! Two sets are isomorphic if and only if they have the same
cardinality, so to distinguish X and Y we need only look at the case when Z is the one-point
set ∗. Indeed, a morphism ∗→X is a choice of element x ∈X, and X and Y will have the
same cardinality if and only if Set(∗, X)  Set(∗, Y).

Chapter 0
Perhaps it’s not surprising that the full arsenal of the Yoneda lemma is not needed to distin-
guish sets. After all, they have no internal structure. The strength of lemma is more clearly
seen when we look at objects such as groups or topological spaces that have more interest-
ing aspects. But we include the example to draw attention to some notation you’ll likely
have noticed: we choose to omit the parentheses around the arguments of morphisms, for
example, f x versus f(x). This is consistent with category theory’s frequent emphasis on
morphisms, for as we’ve just seen, every element x in a set X can be viewed as a morphism
x: ∗→X. So given a function f : X →Y, the image of x in Y is ultimately the composite
morphism f x.
Keeping in tune with the previous paragraph, we now proceed to a discussion on basic
set theory by recasting familiar material in a more categorical light.
0.3
Basic Set Theory
We’ll begin with a brief review of functions.
0.3.1
Functions
A function is said to be injective if and only if it is left cancellative. That is, f : X →Y
is injective if and only if for all functions g1, g2 : Z →X with fg1 = fg2, it follows that
g1 = g2. Equivalently, f is injective if and only if f∗: Set(Z, X) →Set(Z, Y) is injective
for all Z. Yet another equivalent deﬁnition is that f is injective if and only if it has a left
inverse, that is, if and only if there exists g: Y →X so that g f = idY. Note that the
composition of injective functions is injective; also, for any f : X →Y and g: Y →Z, if
g f is injective, then f is injective. We will denote injective functions by hooked arrows, as
in f : X ,→Y.
More generally, left-cancellative morphisms in any category are called monomorphisms
or said to be monic and are denoted with arrows with tails as in X ↣Y. In this more
general case, left invertible implies left cancellative, but not conversely. For example, the
map n 7→2n deﬁnes a left-cancellative group homomorphism f : Z/2Z →Z/4Z. However,
there is no group homomorphism g: Z/4Z →Z/2Z so that g f = idZ/2Z .
A function is said to be surjective if and only if it is right cancellative. That is, f : X →Y
is surjective if and only if for all functions g1, g2 : Y →Z with g1 f = g2 f, it follows that
g1 = g2. Equivalently, f is surjective if and only if f ∗: Set(Y, Z) →Set(X, Z) is injective
for all Z or, equivalent still, if and only if it has a right inverse. That is, f : X →Y is
surjective if and only if there exists g: Y →X so that fg = idX. The composition of
surjective functions is surjective, and for any f : X →Y and g: Y →Z, if g f is surjective,
then g is surjective. Surjective functions will be denoted with two headed arrows as in
f : X ↠Y.
In general, right-cancellative morphisms in any category are called epimorphisms or said
to be epic and are also denoted with two-headed arrows. Right invertible implies right

cancellative in any category, but not conversely. (You are asked to provide an example in
exercise 0.3 at the end of the chapter.)
Finally, note that in Set a function that is both injective and surjective is an isomor-
phism. This is because left invertible and right invertible imply invertible. (You should
check that having a left inverse and a right inverse both imply there’s a single two-sided
inverse). But left cancellative and right cancellative together do not imply invertible: there
are categories—and Top is one of them—that have morphisms that are both monic and
epic, which nonetheless fail to be isomorphisms.
0.3.2
The Empty Set and One-Point Set
The empty set ∅is initial in Set. That is, for any set X there is a unique function ∅→X.
On the other hand, the one-point set ∗is terminal. That is, for any set X, there is a unique
function X →∗. You might take issue with the deﬁnite article “the” in “the one-point set,”
but it is standard to use the deﬁnite article in circumstances that are unique up to unique
isomorphism. That is the case here: if ∗and ∗′ are both one-point sets, then there is a
unique isomorphism ∗
−→∗′. Note also that this terminology is not unique to Set: we can
make sense of initial and terminal objects in any category, though such objects may not
always exist. An object C in a category C is called terminal if for every object X in C there
is a unique morphism X →C. Dually, an object D is called initial if for every object X in
C there is a unique morphism D →X.
0.3.3
Products and Coproducts in Set
The Cartesian product of two sets X and Y is deﬁned to be the set X ×Y of all ordered pairs
(x, y) such that x ∈X and y ∈Y. While this tells us what the set X × Y is, it doesn’t say
much about the properties that it possesses or how it relates to other sets in the category.
This prompts us to look for a more categorical description of the Cartesian product.
The Cartesian product of two sets X and Y is a set X×Y that comes with maps π1 : X×Y →
X and π2 : X × Y →Y. The product is characterized by the property that for any set Z and
any functions f1 : Z →X and f2 : Z →Y, there is a unique map h: Z →X × Y with
π1h = f1 and π2h = f2. By “characterized by,” we mean that the Cartesian product is the
unique (up to isomorphism) object in Set with this property.
Z

Y

f2
h
π1
π2
As an example, note the isomorphism of ﬁnite sets {1, . . . , n} × {1, . . . , m}  {1, . . . , nm}.

16
Chapter 0
The disjoint union of two sets X and Y also has a categorical description. It is a set
X ` Y that comes with maps i1 : X →X ` Y and i2 : Y →X ` Y and is characterized by
the property that for any set Z and any functions f1 : X →Z and f2 : Y →Z, there is a
unique map h: X ` Y →Z with hi1 = f1 and hi2 = f2.
X
Y
X ` Y

Sometimes, disjoint union is called the sum and is denoted X + Y or X ⊕Y instead of
X ` Y. As an example, note that {1, . . . , n} + {1, . . . , m}  {1, . . . , n + m}. The property
characterizing the disjoint union is dual to the one characterizing the product, and the
disjoint union is sometimes called the coproduct of sets.
We can also take products and disjoint unions of arbitrary collections of sets. The disjoint
union of a collection of sets {Xα}α∈A is a set `
α∈A Xα together with maps iα : Xα →` Xα
satisfying the property that for any set Z and any collection of functions {fα : Xα →Z},
there is a unique map h: ` Xα →Z with hiα = fα for all α ∈A.

The product of a collection of sets {Xα}α∈A is sometimes described as the subset of
functions f : A →` Xα satisfying f(α) ∈Xα. But, as we mentioned earlier, what’s
more important than the construction of the product is to understand its universal prop-
erty. The product of a collection of sets {Xα}α∈A is a set Q
α∈A Xα together with maps
πα : Q Xα →Xα characterized by the property that for any set Z and any collection of
functions {fα : Z →Xα}, there is a unique map h: Z →Q Xα with παh = fα for all α ∈A.

0.3.4
Products and Coproducts in Any Category
The universal properties outlined above provide a template for deﬁning products and co-
products—and more generally limits and colimits—in any category. A more complete
discussion is found in chapter 4, but for now, we’d like to point out that in an arbitrary
category, products and coproducts may not exist, and when they do they might not look
like disjoint unions or Cartesian products. For example, the category Fld of ﬁelds doesn’t
have products: if there were a ﬁeld k that were the product of F2 and F3, then there would
be homomorphisms k →F2 and k →F3. But this is impossible since the characteristic
of k would be equal to both 2 and 3. On the other hand the category Vectk and more
generally RMod has both products and coproducts. Products are Cartesian products, but
coproducts are direct sums. In Grp coproducts are free products, while in the category of
abelian groups, coproducts are direct sums. Even in the category Set, there is something
to say about the existence of products and coproducts. The axiom of choice is precisely the
statement that for any nonempty collection of sets {Xα}α∈A, the product Q Xα exists and is
nonempty. (For more on the axiom of choice, see section 3.4.)
Even though products and coproducts in an arbitrary category might look different than
they do in Set, the constructions are closely related to the constructions in Set. That’s
because the universal properties of products and coproducts in an arbitrary category C
yield bijections of sets
C  `
α Xα, Z  Q
α C (Xα, Z)
C  Z, Q
α Xα
  Q
α C (Z, Xα)
In other words, the product is characterized by the fact that maps into it are in bijection
with maps into each of the factors. Dually, the coproduct is characterized by the fact that
maps out of it are in bijection with maps out of each of the components. (In a sense that can
be made precise, products and coproducts in a category are [co]representations of products
and coproducts of sets.) To phrase it another way, coproducts come out of the ﬁrst entry
of hom as products, and products come out of the second entry of hom as products. An
example where this comes up often is in Vectk and RMod where the coproduct is direct sum
and the product is Cartesian product. For an R module X, let X∗:= RMod(X, R) denote the
dual space. Then setting Z = R in the ﬁrst isomorphism above yields
L
Xα
∗

Q (Xα)∗
So the fact that the “the dual of the sum is the product of the duals” is a consequence of the
existence of coproducts in RMod.
0.3.5
Exponentiation in Set
In the category of sets, the set of morphisms Set(X, Y) is also denoted YX. Moreover there
is a natural evaluation map eval X×: YX →Y deﬁned by eval(x, f) = f x. The exponential

18
Chapter 0
notation is convenient for expressing various isomorphisms, such as
(X × Y)Z

XZ × YZ
which is a concise way to express the universal property of the Cartesian product: maps
from a set Z into a product correspond to maps from Z into the factors. There is also the
isomorphism
YX×Z

(YX)Z
which is an expression of the product-hom adjunction. We made brief mention of this
adjunction in example 0.6 and will discuss it in greater detail in example 5.1. But here’s a
sneak preview. Fix a set X. Let L be the functor X × −and let R be the functor Set(X, −).
In this notation, the isomorphism YX×Z  (YX)Z becomes Set(LZ, Y)  Set(Z, RY), which
evokes the deﬁning property of adjoint linear maps. (Hence the term “adjunction.”)
0.3.6
Partially Ordered Sets
A partially ordered set or poset is a set P together with a relation ≤on P that is reﬂexive,
transitive, and antisymmetric. Reﬂexive means that for all a ∈P, a ≤a; transitive means
that for all a, b, c ∈P, if a ≤b and b ≤c, then a ≤c; antisymmetric means that for all
a, b ∈P, if a ≤b and b ≤a, then a = b.
One can view a poset as a category whose objects are the elements of P by declaring
there to be a morphism a →b if and only if a ≤b. Transitivity says not only can composi-
tion be deﬁned, but it may only be deﬁned in one way since there’s at most one morphism
between objects. Alternatively, one can deﬁne a poset to be a (small) category with the
property that there’s at most one morphism between objects.
We expect that you have encountered different deﬁnitions for some of the concepts in
this section than what we have provided. In your previous work, an injective function,
for example, might have been deﬁned in terms of what it does to the elements of the
domain. Here, instead, we’ve deﬁned an injective function in terms of how it interacts
with other functions. For another example, instead of deﬁning what the disjoint X ` Y is
(which ultimately involves the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of union and extension), we’ve
characterized it up to isomorphism by explaining how it interacts with other sets, bringing
back to mind the Lawvere quote that opened the chapter.

Examples and Constructions
All of it was written by Sammy.... I wrote nothing.
—Henri Cartan (Jackson, 1999)
Introduction.
Our goal in this chapter is to construct new topological spaces from given ones.
We’ll do so by focusing on four basic constructions: subspaces in section 1.2, quotients in section
1.3, products in section 1.4, and coproducts in section 1.5. To maintain a categorical perspective, the
discussion of each construction will ﬁt into the following template:
• The classic deﬁnition: an explicit construction of the topological space
• The ﬁrst characterization: a description of the topology as either the coarsest or the ﬁnest
topology for which maps into or out of the space are continuous, leading to a better deﬁnition
• The second characterization: a description of the topology in terms of a universal property as
given in theorems 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4
Before we construct topological spaces, it will be good to have some examples in mind. We’ll begin
then in section 1.1 with examples of topological spaces and continuous maps between them.
1.1
Examples and Terminology
Let’s open with examples of spaces followed by examples of continuous functions.
1.1.1
Examples of Spaces
Example 1.1 Any set X may be endowed with the coﬁnite topology, where a set U is
open if and only its complement X ∖U is ﬁnite (or if U = ∅). Similarly, any set may be
equipped with the cocountable topology whose open sets are those whose complement is
countable.
Example 1.2 The empty set ∅and the one-point set ∗are topological spaces in unique
ways. For any space X, the unique functions ∅→X and X →∗are continuous. The
empty set is initial and the one-point set is terminal in Top, just as they are in Set.
Example 1.3 As we saw in section 0.1, R is a topological space with the usual metric
topology, but it admits other topologies, too. For example, like any set, R has a coﬁnite

22
Chapter 1
topology and a cocountable topology. The set R also has a topology with basis of open sets
given by intervals of the form [a, b) for a < b. This is called the lower limit topology (or the
Sorgenfrey topology, or the uphill topology, or the half-open topology). Unless speciﬁed
otherwise, R will be given the metric topology.
Example 1.4 In general, for any totally ordered set X, the intervals (a, b) = {x ∈X | a <
x < b}, along with the intervals (a, ∞) and (−∞, b), deﬁne a topology called the order
topology. The set R is totally ordered and the order topology on R coincides with the usual
topology.
Example 1.5 Unless otherwise speciﬁed, the natural numbers N and the integers Z are
given discrete topologies, but there are others. Notably, there is a topology on Z for which
the sets
S (a, b)
=
{an + b | n ∈N}
for a ∈Z ∖{0} and b ∈Z, together with ∅, are open. Furstenberg used this topology in a
delightful proof noting that there are inﬁnitely many primes (see Mercer (2009)). It’s not
hard to check that the sets S (a, b) are also closed in this topology, and since every integer
except ±1 has a prime factor, it follows that
Z ∖{−1, +1}
=
S
p prime
S (p, 0)
Since the left hand side is not closed (no nonempty ﬁnite set can be open) there must be
inﬁnitely many closed sets in the union on the right. Therefore there are inﬁnitely many
primes!
Example 1.6 Let R be a commutative ring with unit and let spec R denote the set of prime
ideals of R. The Zariski topology on spec R is deﬁned by declaring the closed sets to be the
sets of the form VE = {p ∈spec R | E ⊆p}, where E is any subset of R.
Example 1.7 A norm on a real (or complex) vector space V is a function ∥−∥: V →R
(or C), satisfying
• ∥v∥≥0 for all vectors v with equality if and only if v = 0
• ∥v + w∥≤∥v∥+ ∥w∥for all vectors v, w
• ∥αv∥= |α|∥v∥for all scalars α and vectors v
Every normed vector space is a metric space and hence a topological space with metric
deﬁned by d(x, y) = ∥x −y∥. The standard metric on Rn comes from the norm deﬁned by
∥(x1, . . . , xn)∥:=
pPn
i=1 |xi|2. More generally, for any p ≥1, the p-norm on Rn is deﬁned
by
∥(x1, . . . , xn)∥p
:=
Pn
i=1 |xi|p 1
p
and the sup norm is deﬁned by
∥(x1, . . . , xn)∥∞
:=
sup{|x1|, . . . , |xn|}

Examples and Constructions
23
These norms deﬁne different metrics with different open balls, but for any of these norms
on Rn, the passage norm ⇝metric ⇝topology leads to the same topology. In fact, for any
choice of norm on a ﬁnite dimensional vector space, the corresponding topological spaces
are the same—not just homeomorphic but literally the same.
Example 1.8 We can generalize the previous example from Rn to RN, the space of se-
quences in R, if we avoid those sequences with divergent norm. The set lp of sequences
{xn} for which P∞
n=1 xp
n is ﬁnite is a subspace of RN (see section 1.2), and lp with
∥{xi}∥p
:=
 P∞
i=1 |xi|p 1
p
is a normed vector space. It’s difﬁcult to compare the topological spaces lp for different
p since the underlying sets are different. For instance, {1/n} is in l2 but not in l1. Even
so, the spaces lp are homeomorphic as topological spaces (Kadets, 1967). The the set l∞
of bounded sequences with ∥{xi}∥:= sup |xi| is also a normed vector space, but it is not
homeomorphic to lp for p , ∞; it is an exercise to prove it.
Note that set RN of sequences (x1, x2, . . .) in R can be viewed as a topological space
when endowed with the product topology (deﬁned in section 1.4) and the subset of pth
power summable sequences can be given a subspace topology (deﬁned in section 1.2).
The resulting topology is quite different from the topology obtained from viewing lp as a
normed vector space.
1.1.2
Examples of Continuous Functions
With some examples of spaces in tow, let’s now consider a few examples of continuous
functions. The ﬁrst one we’ll look at is a vivid illustration in Top of the philosophy (intro-
duced in chapter 0) that objects are determined by their relationships with other objects.
Example 1.9 The set S = {0, 1} with the topology {∅, {1}, S } is sometimes called the
Sierpi´nski two-point space. In this topology, for any open set U ⊆X, the characteristic
function χU : X →S deﬁned by
χU(x) =

1
if x ∈U
0
if x < U
is a continuous function. What’s more, every continuous function f : X →S is of the form
χU where U = f −1{1}. Thus the open subsets of X are in one-to-one correspondence with
continuous functions X →S . In other words the set Top(X, S ) is a copy of the topology of
X.
Example 1.10 The previous example shows that the topology of a space X can be recov-
ered from the set of maps Top(X, S ), so you might wonder: can the points be recovered,
too? But that’s an easy “Yes!” Since a point x ∈X is the same as a map ∗→X, the set of
points of a space X is isomorphic to the set Top(∗, X).

24
Chapter 1
A practical impact of the philosophy referred to above is that a space X can be studied by
looking at continuous functions either to or from a (usually simpler) space. For example,
the fundamental group of X, which we’ll cover in chapter 6, involves functions from the
circle S 1 to X. And sequences in X, which are used to probe topological properties (as
we’ll see in chapter 3), are continuous functions from the discrete space N to X. On the
other hand, maps out of X are also interesting. For instance, maps from X to the discrete
space {0, 1} detect connectedness. For another instance involving maps into X, homotopy
classes of maps ∗→X reveal path components. We’ll discuss both connectedness and
path connectedness in section 2.1. And speaking of paths.. ..
Example 1.11 A path in a space X is a continuous function γ: [0, 1] →X. A loop in a
space X is a continuous function γ: [0, 1] →X with γ0 = γ1.
γ0
γ1
γ0 = γ1
path
loop
Example 1.12 If (X, d) is a metric space and x ∈X, then the function f : X →R deﬁned
by fy = d(x, y) is continuous.
Example 1.13 Unlike the categories Grp and Vectk where bijective morphisms are iso-
morphisms, not every continuous bijection between topological spaces is a homeomor-
phism. For example, the identity function id: (R, Tdiscrete) →(R, Tusual) is a continuous
bijection that is not a homeomorphism. But continuous bijections are always homeomor-
phisms in the category of compact Hausdorff spaces—see corollary 2.18.2.
Armed with examples of topological spaces and continuous functions, we now turn to the
question of construction. How can we construct new spaces from existing ones? Sub-
spaces, quotients, products, and coproducts are a few ways, and although the deﬁnitions of
some (or perhaps all) of these constructions may be familiar, keep in mind that the goal of
the remainder of the chapter is to view them through a categorical lens. As mentioned in the
chapter introduction, we’ll accomplish this by exploring each construction—a subspace, a
quotient, a product, a coproduct—in three stages:
• The classic deﬁnition: the familiar, explicit construction of the topology
• The ﬁrst characterization: a description of the topology as either the coarsest or the

As the text unwinds, take note of the words “ﬁnest” and “coarsest” in the ﬁrst characteri-
zation. Which term appears in which of the four constructions? Also keep an eye out for
which topologies are characterized by maps into the space and which are characterized by
maps out of the space.
1.2
The Subspace Topology
Given a set X, we can obtain a new set by choosing a subset Y of X. If X is endowed with
a topology, we’d like a way to see Y as a topological space, too. This leads to the ﬁrst of
the four constructions—a subspace. The subspace topology is often deﬁned (for example,
in Munkres (2000)) as follows:
Deﬁnition 1.1 Let (X, TX) be a topological space and let Y be any subset of X. The sub-
space topology on Y is given by TY := {U ∩Y | U ∈TX}.
You can and are encouraged to check that this deﬁnition does indeed deﬁne a topology on
Y. What’s more interesting, though, is the property it satisﬁes. In particular, Y naturally
comes with an inclusion map i: Y →X, and the subspace topology is the coarsest topology
on Y for which i is continuous. This is its ﬁrst characterization.
1.2.1
The First Characterization
Before we elaborate on this characterization, let’s consider a more general situation by way
of motivation. Let (X, TX) be a topological space and let S be any set whatsoever. Consider
a function
f : S →X
It makes no sense to ask if f is continuous until S is equipped with a topology. There
always exist topologies on the set S that will make f continuous—the discrete topology is
one. But is there a coarser one? Is there a coarsest one? The answer to both questions is
“yes.” Indeed, the intersection of any topologies on S for which f is continuous is again a
topology on S for which f is continuous. Therefore, the intersection of all topologies on
S for which f is continuous will be the coarsest topology for which f is continuous. Let’s
call it Tf and observe that it has the simple description {f −1U | U ⊆X is open}. This shows
that the subspace topology TY on a subset Y ⊆X is the same as Ti where i: Y →X is the
natural inclusion. This prompts us to adopt a better deﬁnition for the subspace topology.
Better deﬁnition
Let (X, TX) be a topological space and let Y be any subset of X. The
subspace topology on Y is the coarsest topology on Y for which the canonical inclusion
i: Y ,→X is continuous.
More generally, if S is any set and if f : S →X is an injective function, then Tf —the
coarsest topology on S for which f is continuous—may be called the subspace topology
on S . This is a good deﬁnition even though the set S is not necessarily a subset of X.

26
Chapter 1
Why? Since f is injective, S is isomorphic as a set to its image fS ⊆X, and the space
(S, Tf ) determined by f : S →X is homeomorphic to fS ⊆X with the subspace topology
determined by the inclusion i: fS ,→X. (If f : S →X is not injective, then there is still
a coarsest topology Tf on S that makes f continuous, though we won’t refer to it as the
subspace topology.)
Deﬁnition 1.2 Suppose f : Y →X is a continuous injection between topological spaces.
The map f is called an embedding when the topology on Y is the same as the subspace
topology Tf induced by f.
Example 1.14 Consider the set [0, 1] with the discrete topology.
The evident map
i: ([0, 1], Tdiscrete) →(R, Tordinary) is a continuous injection, but it is not an embedding.
The topology on the domain is not the subspace topology induced by i.
Notice that endowing a subset Y ⊆X with the subspace topology provides meaning to the
question, “Is a function Z →Y continuous?” Simply put, the subspace topology deter-
mines continuous maps to Y. The converse holds as well: continuous maps to Y determine
the topology on Y. This is yet another illustration of the philosophy that objects in a cat-
egory are determined by morphisms to and from them. It’s also the heart of the second
characterization of the subspace topology.
1.2.2
The Second Characterization
This way of thinking about the subspace topology describes the important universal prop-
erty which characterizes precisely which functions into the subspace are continuous—they
are, reasonably, the functions Z →Y that are continuous when regarded as functions into
X.
Theorem 1.1 Let (X, TX) be a topological space, let Y be a subset of X, and let i: Y ,→X
be the natural inclusion. The subspace topology on Y is characterized by the following
property:
Universal property for the subspace topology
For every topological space (Z, TZ) and
every function f : Z →Y, f is continuous if and only if the map i f : Z →X is continuous.
Z
Y
X
f
i f
i
Proof. Let’s think of this theorem in two parts: we’ll ﬁrst verify that the subspace topology
has the universal property. Then we’ll verify that the subspace topology is characterized
by this universal property, which is to say that any topology on Y satisfying the universal
property must be the subspace topology.

Examples and Constructions
27
To start, let TY be the subspace topology on Y, let (Z, TZ) be any topological space, and
let f : Z →Y be a function. We have to prove that f : Z →Y is continuous if and only
if i f : Z →X is continuous. First, if f is continuous, then the composition of continuous
functions i f : Z →X is also continuous. Now suppose i f : Z →X is continuous, and let U
be any open set in Y. Then U = i−1V for some open V ⊆X. Since i f is continuous, the set
(i f)−1V ⊆Z is open in Z. And since (i f)−1V = f −1U, it follows that f −1U is open and so
f : Z →Y is continuous. The topology TY therefore has the universal property above.
Suppose now that T ′ is any topology on Y having the universal property. We’ll prove
that T ′ equals the subspace topology TY, that is T ′ ⊆TY and TY ⊆T ′. The universal
property for T ′ is that for every topological space (Z, TZ) and for any function f : Z →Y,
the map f is continuous if and only if i f is continuous. In particular, if we let (Z, TZ) be
(Y, TY) where TY is the subspace topology on Y and let f : Y →Y be the identity function,
then we have the following diagram
(Y, TY)
(Y, T ′)
X
idY
i idY=i
i
Since we know the function i idY = i: Y →X is continuous when Y has the subspace
topology T , the universal property implies that idY : (Y, TY) →(Y, T ′) is continuous, and
therefore the subspace topology TY is ﬁner than T ′, that is T ′ ⊆TY. Finally, to show
that TY ⊆T ′, let (Z, TZ) be (Y, T ′) and let f = idY : (Y, T ′) →(Y, T ′). So we have the
following diagram
(Y, T ′)
(Y, T ′)
X
idY
i idY=i
i
The continuity of idY implies that i idY = i: Y →X is also continuous, and so T ′ is a
topology on Y for which the inclusion i: Y →X is continuous. But the subspace topology
TY is the coarsest topology on Y for which i: Y →X is continuous, and therefore TY is
coarser than T ′. In other words TY ⊆T ′.
Example 1.15 In the subspace topology on Q ⊆R, open sets are of the form Q ∩(a, b)
whenever a < b. Notice that the discrete and subspace topologies on Q are not equivalent:
for any rational r, the singleton set {r} is open in the former but not in the latter.

1.3
The Quotient Topology
Before getting to the deﬁnition and characterizations of the quotient topology, let’s recall
how quotients of sets work. Suppose X is a set and let ∼be an equivalence relation on
X. Then X/∼denotes the set of equivalence classes, and the natural projection π: X ↠
X/∼that sends x to its equivalence class deﬁnes a surjective function whose ﬁbers are the
equivalence classes of ∼.
Conversely, given any set S and any surjection π: X ↠S , the set S is isomorphic to X/∼
where ∼is the equivalence relation whose equivalence classes are the ﬁbers of π:
x ∼y ⇐⇒πx = πy
The map π conveniently provides the isomorphism
S
X/∼
s
π−1s

Now suppose X is a topological space. So we have a surjective map π: X ↠S from a
topological space X to a set S . What kind of topology can or should we give the set S ?
This topology—called the quotient topology—is often deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 1.3 A set U ⊆S is open in the quotient topology if and only if π−1U is open in
X.
Because S and X/∼(the quotient determined by the ﬁbers of π) aren’t even distinguishable
as sets, we can always think of the quotient topology as being deﬁned either on S or on
X/∼. This is analogous to thinking of the subspace topology determined by an injection
f : S ,→X as either being deﬁned on S or as being deﬁned on the subset fS ⊆X.
1.3.1
The First Characterization
It doesn’t make sense to ask if π is continuous when π: X ↠S is a map from a topological
space X to a set S . We can ask whether there exists a topology on S for which π : X ↠S
continuous. The answer to this question is a straightforward “yes” if S is endowed with
the indiscrete topology. But is there a ﬁner topology? Is there a ﬁnest topology? Again,
the answer is afﬁrmative. In fact, deﬁnition 1.3 makes the quotient topology on S the ﬁnest
topology for which the map π: X →S is continuous: declaring U to be open only if π−1U
is open implies that π is continuous, while declaring U to be open if π−1U is open makes
the quotient topology the ﬁnest topology for which π is continuous. We thus obtain the
ﬁrst characterization of the quotient topology, which is a better deﬁnition.
Better deﬁnition
Let X be a topological space, let S be a set, and let π: X ↠S be
surjective. The quotient topology on S is the ﬁnest topology for which π is continuous, and
π is called a quotient map.

Examples and Constructions
29
A word of caution: be careful when talking about the ﬁnest topology satisfying some prop-
erty since such a topology may not exist. This is less of an issue for the coarsest topology
satisfying a property. The difference is that the intersection of topologies is always a topol-
ogy, whereas the union of topologies is usually not a topology.
1.3.2
The Second Characterization
In section 1.2.2, we observed that a topology on a subset Y ⊆X is determined by specifying
what Top(Z, Y) is for any space Z. Analogously, given a surjection π: X ↠S from a space
to a set, a topology on S is determined by specifying what Top(S, Z) is for any space Z. The
universal property that characterizes the quotient topology on S tells us that the continuous
maps S →Z are precisely those whose precompositon with π are continuous functions
X →Z.
Theorem 1.2 Let X be a topological space, let S be a set, and let π: X →S be surjective.
The quotient topology on S is determined by the following property.
Universal property for the quotient topology
For every topological space Z and every
function f : S →Z, f is continuous if and only if fπ: X →Z is continuous.
X
S
Z
fπ
π
f
Proof. Exercise.
The universal property of the quotient topology tells us precisely which functions S →Z
from a quotient to a space Z are continuous: they are continuous maps X →Z that are
constant on the ﬁbers of π: X →S .
Example 1.16 The map π: [0, 1] →S 1 deﬁned by π(t) =   cos(2πt), sin(2πt) is a quotient
map. Therefore, for any space Z, continuous functions S 1 →Z are the same as continuous
functions [0, 1] →Z which factor through π. That is, continuous functions S 1 →Z are the
same as paths γ: [0, 1] →Z satisfying γ0 = γ1. These are the loops in Z.
Example 1.17 The projective space RPn is deﬁned to be the quotient of Rn+1 ∖{0} by the
relation x ∼λx for λ ∈R. So RPn is the set of all lines through the origin in Rn+1, and the
quotient topology gives us the topology on this set of lines.
Example 1.18 As in the previous example, topological spaces are often constructed by
starting with a familiar space and then identifying points to obtain a quotient. In the ﬁgure
below, for instance, a new space is obtained from the unit square I2 in R2 by identifying
opposite sides. The topology on I2/∼is obtained from the mapping I2 →I2/∼where

30
Chapter 1
(x, 0) ∼(x, 1) and (0, y) ∼(1, y).
The resulting quotient space is called the torus, T. Other identiﬁcations of the square yield
the Mobius band M, the Klein bottle K, and the projective plane RP2:
M
K
RP2
Notice now that we have two deﬁnitions of RP2: example 1.17 describes it as the space of
lines through the origin, and here we’ve described it as a quotient of the unit square. We
encourage you to verify that these two descriptions yield homeomorphic spaces.
1.4
The Product Topology
Let {Xα}α∈A be an arbitrary collection of topological spaces and consider the set
X =
Y
α∈A
Xα
We’d like to make the set X into a topological space, but how? One way is by equipping it
with the product topology, typically deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 1.4 The product topology on X is deﬁned to be the topology generated by the
basis

Y
α∈A
Uα
 Uα ⊆Xα is open and all but ﬁnitely many Uα = Xα

But this deﬁnition, with its surprising “all but ﬁnitely many,” suggests that there are better
ways to deﬁne the product topology. And indeed, there are.
1.4.1
The First Characterization
Recall from section 0.3.3 that the set X comes with projection maps πα : X →Xα. Is there
a topology on X for which these natural maps are continuous? The discrete topology is
certainly one, and the intersection of all topologies that make the projections continuous
will be the coarsest topology for which the projections are continuous.

Examples and Constructions
31
Better deﬁnition
Let {Xα}α∈A be an arbitrary collection of topological spaces and let X =
Q
α∈A Xα. The product topology on X is deﬁned to be the coarsest topology on X for which
all of the projections πα are continuous.
The better deﬁnition of the product topology is equivalent to deﬁnition 1.4, and we’ll leave
the proof as an exercise.
1.4.2
The Second Characterization
The second characterization of the product topology amounts to saying precisely which
functions to the product are continuous. As before, let {Xα}α∈A be an arbitrary collection of
topological spaces, and consider the set X = Q
α∈A Xα. Keeping in mind that the universal
property of the product of sets says that functions into X are the same as collections of
functions into the sets Xα, it’s not hard to guess that for any space Z, a map Z →X is
continuous whenever all the components Z →X →Xα are continuous.
Theorem 1.3 Let {Xα}α∈A be an arbitrary collection of topological spaces, and let X =
Q
α∈A Xα. Let πα : X →Xα denote the natural projection. The product topology on X is
characterized by the following property.
Universal property for the product topology
For every topological space Z and every
function f : Z →X, f is continuous if and only if for every α ∈A, the component
πα f : Z →Xα is continuous.
Z
X
Xα
πα f
f
πα
Proof. Exercise.
Example 1.19 Let X = R2. One can write any function f : S →R2 in terms of com-
ponent functions f s = (xs, ys), where the components xs and ys are simply given by the
composition
S
R2
R
R
x
y
f
π1
π2

32
Chapter 1
The function f is continuous if and only if x and y are continuous, and it’s good to realize
that this way of specifying which functions into R2 are continuous completely determines
the topology on R2.
But be careful: functions from R2 and more generally Rn can be confusing, in part because
our familiarity with Rn can give unjustiﬁed topological importance to the maps R →R2
given by ﬁxing one of the coordinates. So don’t make the mistake of thinking that a func-
tion f : R2 →S is continuous if the maps x 7→f(x, y0) and y 7→f(x0, y) are continuous
for every x0 and y0, as in the diagram below:
R
R
R2
S
x7→(x,y0)
f(x,y0)
y7→(x0,y)
f(x0,y)
f
Here’s a counterexample to keep in mind: the function f : R2 →R deﬁned by
f(x, y) =

xy
x2 + y2
if (x, y) , (0, 0)
0
if (x, y) = (0, 0)
is not continuous even though for any choice of x0 or y0, the maps f(x, y0) and f(x0, y) are
continuous functions R →R.
1.5
The Coproduct Topology
Let {Xα}α∈A be a collection of topological spaces. We’d like to make the disjoint union
X = `
α∈A Xα into a topological space. Typically, this is done via the following explicit
deﬁnition of the coproduct topology.
Deﬁnition 1.5 A set U ⊆X is open in the coproduct topology if and only if it is of the
form U = `
α∈A Uα where each Uα ⊆Xα is open.
But since the disjoint union—when viewed as a set—comes with canonical inclusion func-
tions iα : Xα →` Xα for each α, we’d like a topology on X for which these natural maps
are continuous.
1.5.1
The First Characterization
There are many topologies on ` Xα for which the inclusions iα are continuous—the in-
discrete topology is one. But the right topology to put on ` Xα is the ﬁnest topology for
which the maps Xα →` Xα are all continuous. This leads to another deﬁnition—one that
is equivalent to deﬁnition 1.5 but better.

Examples and Constructions
33
Better deﬁnition
Let {Xα}α∈A be an arbitrary collection of topological spaces, and let
X = `
α∈A Xα. The coproduct topology on X is deﬁned to be the ﬁnest topology on X for
which all of the inclusions iα are continuous.
1.5.2
The Second Characterization
To characterize the coproduct topology a second way, recall from section 0.3.3 that func-
tions from X, viewed as a set, are determined by collections of functions from Xα. That
is, for any set Z, a collection of functions fα : Xα →Z corresponds uniquely to a func-
tion X →Z. Not surprisingly, then, the coproduct topology on X is characterized by the
following universal property.
Theorem 1.4 Let {Xα}α∈A be an arbitrary collection of topological spaces and let X =
`
α∈A. Let iα : Xα →X denote the natural inclusion. The coproduct topology on X is
characterized by the following property.
Universal property for the coproduct topology
For every topological space Z and ev-
ery function f : X →Z, f is continuous if and only if for every α ∈A, fiα : Xα →Z is
continuous.
Xα
X
Z
iα
fiα
f
Proof. Exercise.
Example 1.20 Any set X is the coproduct over its points viewed as singletons:
X 
a
x∈X
{x}
As topological spaces, however, X is homeomorphic to `
x∈X{x} if and only if X has the
discrete topology.
Here’s a summary of the results we’ve collected thus far:
• The subspace topology on a subset Y ⊆X is the coarsest topology for which the
natural inclusion Y ,→X is continuous. It’s determined by maps into the subspace.
• The quotient topology on a quotient X/∼is the ﬁnest topology for which the natural
projection X ↠X/∼is continuous. It’s determined by maps out of the quotient.
• The product topology on a set Q
α∈A Xα is the coarsest topology for which the natural
projections Q
α∈A Xα →Xα are continuous. It’s determined by maps into the product.

34
Chapter 1
• The coproduct topology on a set `
α∈A Xα is the ﬁnest topology for which the nat-
ural inclusions Xα →`
α∈A Xα are continuous. It’s determined by maps out of the
coproduct.
You’ll notice that “coarsest” and “into” are paired in the ﬁrst and third constructions while
“ﬁnest” and “out of” are paired in the second and fourth.
This duality is no coinci-
dence. Each of these four constructions is a special case of a more general, categorical
construction—either a limit or a colimit. Limits are characterized by maps into them; co-
limits are characterized by maps out of them. We’ll discuss these constructions in much
greater detail in chapter 4, but exercises 1.12 and 1.13 at the end of the chapter provide a
sneak peek.
1.6
Homotopy and the Homotopy Category
We’ll close this chapter with an important application of the product topology, namely
homotopy. A homotopy from a map f : X →Y to a map g: X →Y is a continuous
function h: X × [0, 1] →Y satisfying h(x, 0) = f x and h(x, 1) = gx. (Notice that “the
topological space X × [0, 1]” makes sense now that we have the product topology!) Two
maps f, g: X →Y are said to be homotopic if there is a homotopy between them, in which
case we write f ≃g. Homotopy deﬁnes an equivalence relation on the maps Top(X, Y), the
equivalence classes of which are called homotopy classes of maps. We use [f] to denote
the homotopy class of f, and we use the notation [X, Y] for the set of homotopy classes
of maps. You can check that the composition of homotopic maps are homotopic, and
thus composition of homotopy classes of maps is well deﬁned. The homotopy category of
topological spaces is deﬁned to be the category hTop whose objects are topological spaces
and whose morphisms are homotopy classes of maps:
hTop(X, Y) := [X, Y]
Two spaces are said to be homotopic if and only if they are isomorphic in hTop. That is,
X and Y are homotopic if and only if there exist maps f : X →Y and g: Y →X so that
g f ≃idX and fg ≃idY. In this case we write X ≃Y. A homotopy invariant is a property
that is invariant under homotopy equivalence. More precisely, there is a natural functor
Top →hTop
with X 7→X and f 7→[f]. Functors from hTop are homotopy invariants, and functors from
the category Top that factor through the functor Top →hTop are called homotopy functors.
Example 1.21 The space Rn is homotopic to the one-point space, Rn ≃∗. To see this,
deﬁne f : ∗→Rn by ∗7→0 and deﬁne g: Rn →∗in the only way possible. Then
g f = id∗, and fg: Rn →0 is homotopic to idRn via the homotopy h: Rn × [0, 1] →Rn

Examples and Constructions
35
given by h(x, t) = tx. Spaces such as Rn that are homotopic to a point are said to be
contractible.
Quite often, a restricted notion of homotopy applies. For example, if α, β: [0, 1] →X are
paths from x to y, then a homotopy of paths is deﬁned to be h: [0, 1]×[0, 1] →Y satisfying
h(t, 0) = αt, h(t, 1) = βt, and h(0, s) = x and h(1, s) = y for all s, t ∈[0, 1]. In other words,
the homotopy ﬁxes the endpoints of the path: for all s, the path t 7→h(t, s) is a path from
x to y agreeing with α at s = 0 and with β at s = 1. At this point, you might wonder
why we’re interested in ﬁxing the endpoints of paths throughout a homotopy of paths. The
reason is simple. Without this requirement, way too many paths may become homotopic:
you could continuously “wind in” the endpoint of a path until it meets the initial point, then
move the initial point around, then expand the point to be another path.
Succinctly put, homotopy in topology is of great importance. We’ll return to it in much
more detail in chapter 6.

Connectedness and Compactness
One of the classical aims of topology is to classify topological spaces by their topological type, or in
other terms to ﬁnd a complete set of topological invariants.
—Samuel Eilenberg (1949)
Introduction.
In chapter 1, we discussed four main constructions of topological spaces: sub-
spaces, quotients, products, and coproducts. In this chapter, we’ll see how these constructions inter-
act with three main topological properties: connectedness, Hausdorff, and compactness. That is, are
subspaces of compact spaces also compact? Is the quotient of a Hausdorff space itself Hausdorff?
Are products of connected spaces also connected? Is a union of connected spaces connected? We’ll
explore these questions and more in the pages to come.
Section 2.1 contains a survey of basic notions, theorems, and examples of connectedness. It also
includes a statement and categorical proof of the one-dimensional version of Brouwer’s well-known
ﬁxed-point theorem. Section 2.2 contains the Hausdorff property, though we’ll keep the discussion
brief. The Hausdorff property becomes much richer once it’s combined with compactness, which is
the content of section 2.3. The same section also introduces three familiar theorems—the Bolzano-
Weierstrass theorem, the Heine-Borel theorem, and Tychonoff’s theorem.
2.1
Connectedness
We’ll begin with a discussion of the main ideas about connectedness. The deﬁnitions are
collected up front and the main results follow. The proofs are mostly left as exercises, but
they can be found in most any classic text on topology, such as Willard (1970), Munkres
(2000), Kelley (1955), Lipschutz (1965).
2.1.1
Deﬁnitions, Theorems, and Examples
Deﬁnition 2.1 A topological space X is connected if and only if one of the following
equivalent conditions holds:
(i)
X cannot be expressed as the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets.
(ii)
Every continuous function f : X →{0, 1} is constant, where {0, 1} is equipped with
the discrete topology.

40
Chapter 2
Exercise 2.1 at the end of the chapter asks you to prove the equivalence of the two deﬁni-
tions. Even though they are equivalent, we prefer the second. We can deﬁne an equivalence
relation ∼′ on X by declaring x ∼′ y if and only if there’s a connected subspace of X that
contains both x and y. Reﬂexivity and symmetry are immediate, while transitivity follows
from theorem 2.3. The equivalence classes of ∼′ are called the connected components of
X. But there is also a different—and richer—kind of connectedness.
Deﬁnition 2.2 A topological space X is said to be path connected if and only if for all
x, y ∈X there is a path that connects x and y.
Recall that a path from x to y in a topological space X is a map γ: I →X with γ0 = x
and γ1 = y. There is an equivalence relation on X deﬁned by declaring x ∼y if and only
if there is a path in X connecting x and y. The existence of the constant path shows ∼is
reﬂexive. To see that it is symmetric, suppose f is a path from x to y. Then g deﬁned by
gt = f(1 −t) is a path from y to x. For transitivity, we ﬁrst deﬁne the product of paths. If
f is a path from x to y and g is a path from y to z, the product g · f is the path from x to z
obtained by ﬁrst traversing f from x to y and then traversing g from y to z, each at twice
the speed:
(g · f)t =

f(2t)
0 ≤t ≤1
2
g(2t −1)
1
2 ≤t ≤1
(2.1)
This shows that ∼is transitive, and the equivalence classes of ∼are called the path
components of X. In essence, path components are homotopy classes of maps ∗→X since
a point x ∈X is a map ∗→X and a path between two points ∗→X is a homotopy between
the maps. We will denote the set of all path components in X by π0X.
Equipped with basic deﬁnitions, we now list some of the theorems. Commentary will
be kept to a minimum as this section is meant to be a highlight of standard results. Do,
however, take special notice of our frequent use of condition (ii) in lieu of condition (i)
from deﬁnition 2.1.
Theorem 2.1 If X is (path) connected and f : X →Y, then f X is (path) connected.
Proof. If f X is not connected, then there is a nonconstant map g: f X →{0, 1}, which
implies the map g f : X →{0, 1} is not constant. Now suppose X is path connected. Let
y, y′ ∈f X so that y = f x and y′ = f x′ for some x, x′ ∈X. By assumption, there is a path
γ: I →X connecting x and x′, and so fγ is a path in Y connecting y and y′.
Corollary 2.1.1 Connected and path connected are topological properties.
Since quotient maps are continuous surjections, we know quotients preserve (path) con-
nectedness.
Corollary 2.1.2 The quotient of a (path) connected space is (path) connected.
With the right hypothesis, we can go the other way.

Connectedness and Compactness

Theorem 2.2 Let X be a space and f : X →Y be a surjective map. If Y is connected in
the quotient topology and if each ﬁber f −1y is connected, then X is connected.
Proof. Let g: X →{0, 1}. Since the ﬁbers of f are connected, g must be constant on each
ﬁber of f. Therefore g factors through f : X →Y, and there is a map g: Y →{0, 1} that
ﬁts into this diagram.
X
Y
{0, 1}
g

g
But Y is connected and so g must be constant. Therefore g = g f is constant.
Theorem 2.3 Suppose X = S
α∈A Xα and that for each α ∈A the space Xα is (path)
connected. If there is a point x ∈T
α∈A Xα then X is (path) connected.
Proof. Exercise.
Theorems 2.3 and 2.2 illustrate common strategies in mathematics. Theorem 2.3 involves a
space decomposed into a collection of open sets. Information about each open set (they’re
connected) and information about the intersection (it’s nonempty) provides information
about the whole space (it’s connected). On the other hand, theorem 2.2 involves a space X
decomposed into ﬁbers over a base space. Here, information about the base space (it’s con-
nected) and information about the ﬁbers (they’re connected) provides information about the
total space (it’s connected). This approach to extending knowledge of parts to knowledge
of the whole appears over and over again in mathematics. Something else that commonly
appears in mathematics is giving counterexamples to help illuminate deﬁnitions.
Example 2.1 The rational numbers Q are not connected as the continuous map k: Q →
{0, 1} deﬁned by kx = 0 if x <
√
2 and kx = 1 if x >
√
2 shows. In fact, the rationals are
totally disconnected, meaning that the only connected subsets are singletons.
This prompts the question: Does R have any connected subsets? If we have a good deﬁ-
nition of connected, then an interval ought to be connected. It turns out that there are no
other connected subsets of R.
Theorem 2.4 The connected subspaces of R are intervals.
Proof. Suppose A is a connected subspace of R that is not an interval. Then there exist
x, y ∈A such that x < z < y for some z < A. Thus
A = (A ∩(−∞, z)) ∪(A ∩(z, ∞))

42
Chapter 2
is a separation of A into two disjoint nonempty open sets.
Conversely, suppose I is an interval with I = U ∪V where U and V are nonempty, open
and disjoint. Then there exist x ∈U and y ∈V, and we may assume x < y. Since the set
U′ = [x, y) ∩U is nonempty and bounded above, s := sup U′ exists by the completeness
of R. Moreover, since x < s ≤y and I is an interval, either s ∈U or s ∈V and so
(s −δ, s + δ) ⊆U or (s −δ, s + δ) ⊆V for some δ > 0. If the former holds, then s fails to
be an upper bound on U′. If the latter, then s −δ is an upper bound for U′ which is smaller
than s. Both lead to a contradiction.
The completeness of R was essential in proving the above, which accounts for our use
of part (i) of deﬁnition 2.1 in the proof in lieu of part (ii). Now that we’ve proved that
the interval I = [0, 1] is connected, we can prove a couple of nice general results about
connectedness and path connectedness. Note that since I is connected, the image of any
path is connected. That is, if k: X →{0, 1} is a continuous map from a space X, then k is
constant along any path γ: I →X. Here are a couple of immediate consequences.
Theorem 2.5 Path connected implies connected.
Proof. Suppose X is path connected, and let k: X →{0, 1} be a function. Choose any two
points in X. There exists a path connecting them. Since k must be constant on that path, it
takes the same value at these two points. Therefore k is constant.
Theorem 2.6 Connected and path connected are homotopy invariants.
Proof. Suppose f : X →Y is a homotopy equivalence, and let g: Y →X and h: Y×I →Y
be a homotopy from fg to idY.
Suppose that X is connected. To show that Y is connected, let k: Y →{0, 1} be any map,
and let y, y′ ∈Y. The map k f : X →{0, 1} must be constant since X is connected, and so
k fgy = k fgy′. Observe that h(y, −): I →Y is a path from h(y, 0) = fgy to h(y, 1) = y, and
so k fgy = ky. Also, h(y′, −): I →Y is a path from h(y′, 0) = fgy′ to h(y′, 1) = y′, and so
k fgy′ = ky′. Therefore, ky = ky′, which implies that k is constant.
Now suppose that X is path connected. Since f X is path connected, we need only worry
about its complement. But if y ∈Y ∖f X, then hy : I →Y is a path from fgy to y. In other
words, any point in Y ∖f X can be connected by a path hy to a point in f X. Therefore Y is
path connected.
The connectedness of I has other nice consequences. We begin with a fun result we found
in Nandakumar and Rao (2012) and Ziegler (2015).
Theorem 2.7 Every convex polygon can be partitioned into two convex polygons, each
having the same area and same perimeter.

Connectedness and Compactness
43
Proof. Let P be a convex polygon, and ﬁrst observe that ﬁnding a line that bisects the area
of P is not difﬁcult. Simply take a vertical line and consider the difference of the area on
the left and the right. As the line moves from left to right the difference goes from negative
to positive continuously and therefore must be zero at some point. Of course, there was
nothing special about a vertical line. There’s a line in every direction which bisects P. So
start with the vertical line, and consider the difference between the perimeter on the left
and the perimeter on the right. Rotate this line in such a way that it always bisects the area
of P, and note that the difference between the perimeters switches sign as the line goes
halfway around. Therefore there exists a line that cuts P into two convex polygons, both
with equal areas and equal perimeters.
The next result is a special case of Brouwer’s ﬁxed-point theorem, a landmark theorem in
topology.
Theorem 2.8 Every continuous function f : [−1, 1] →[−1, 1] has a ﬁxed point.
Proof. Suppose f : [−1, 1] →[−1, 1] is a continuous function for which f x , x for all
x ∈[−1, 1]. In particular we have f(−1) > −1 and f1 < 1. Now deﬁne a map g: [−1, 1] →
{−1, 1} by
gx = x −f x
|x −f x|
Then g is continuous and g(−1) = −1 and g1 = 1. But this is impossible since [−1, 1] is
connected.
We’ve just proved the n = 1 version of Brouwer’s ﬁxed-point theorem which states more
generally that for all n ≥1, any continuous function Dn →Dn must have a ﬁxed point,
where n denotes the n-dimensional disk. The result when n = 2 is proved in section 6.6.3,
where we use a functor called the fundamental group. In fact, we can reprove the n = 1
case using a different but closely related functor, π0.
2.1.2
The Functor π0
As we hinted earlier in the chapter, there is an assignment X 7→π0X that associates to
a space X its set of path components π0X. Now suppose f : X →Y is continuous and
A ⊆X is a path component of X. Then f A is connected and thus contained in a unique
path component of Y. Therefore the function π0 f that sends A to the path component
containing f A deﬁnes a function from π0X →π0Y. These data assemble into a functor

Chapter 2
Now the fact that functors respect composition when applied to morphisms—often referred
to as functoriality—makes them quite powerful. To illustrate, let’s recast the proof of the-
orem 2.8 by using the functoriality of π0. So suppose f : [−1, 1] →[−1, 1] is continuous.
If f x , x for any x, then the map g: [−1, 1] →{−1, 1} deﬁned by
gx = x −f x
|x −f x| =


if x > f x
is continuous, assuming {−1, 1} is given the discrete topology. So we have a homeomor-
phism {−1, 1} →{−1, 1} that factors through [−1, 1], which is to say it can be written as a
composition of the inclusion i: {−1, 1} ,→[−1, 1] with g.
{−1, 1}
[−1, 1]

Applying π0, we get a diagram of sets

But this is impossible! No map {−1, 1} →∗can be left invertible, nor can a map ∗→
{−1, 1} be right invertible.
2.1.3
Constructions and Connectedness
In chapter 1, we worked through the constructions of new topological spaces from old
ones. So far in this chapter, our discussion has centered on two topological properties: con-
nectedness and path connectedness. We’ve already seen some interactions between these
properties and the constructions, but let’s systematically run through the the constructions
and check whether they preserve connectedness. Quotients do, as stated in corollary 2.1.2.
Subspaces don’t preserve connectedness: it doesn’t take much imagination to come up with
an example. Neither do coproducts—the disjoint union of two connected spaces won’t be
connected—but remember theorem 2.3 if the union is not disjoint. Products, as the next
theorem shows, do preserve connectedness.
Theorem 2.9 Let {Xα}α∈A be a collection of (path) connected topological spaces. Then
X := Q
α∈A Xα is (path) connected.
Proof. We’ll prove the theorem for path connected spaces and will leave the rest as an
exercise. Suppose Xα is path connected for every α ∈A, and let a, b ∈X. Since each Xα is
path connected, there exists a path pα : [0, 1] →Xα connecting aα to bα. By the universal
property of the product topology, the unique function p: [0, 1] →X deﬁned by declaring
that παp = pα for all α is continuous, and moreover p is a path from a to b.

Connectedness and Compactness
45
So we’ve addressed the direct question for subspaces, quotients, coproducts, and products.
Before we move on to other topological properties, there are a couple of other interesting
things we can say about connectedness and coproducts.
Every topological space X is partitioned by its connected components {Xα}.
When
viewed as a set, X is always equal to the disjoint union of its connected components
X =
a
α
Xα
But if we view X as a topological space, it may or may not be homeomorphic to the
coproduct of its connected components. For example, the connected components of the
rationals Q are singletons {r}. But as a topological space, Q is not homeomorphic to
`
r∈Q{r} (why not?), which is a countable discrete space. A more positive result is the
following, whose proof we leave as an exercise.
Theorem 2.10 The following are equivalent.
(i)
A space X is the coproduct of its connected components
(ii)
The connected components of X are open.
(iii)
The quotient space X/∼of X by its connected components is discrete.
Recall from deﬁnition 2.1 that a space is connected if and only if the only maps from it to
a two-point discrete space are constant. Let’s make this a little more categorical. Observe
that for any space X there is exactly one function X →∗. And let’s think of a two-point
discrete space as the coproduct ∗` ∗. Now if X is connected, then there are precisely
two maps X →∗` ∗; namely, the two constant functions: X maps to the ﬁrst point and X
maps to the second point. So the set Top(X, ∗` ∗) is the two-point set, which is canonically
isomorphic to Top(X, ∗) ` Top(X, ∗).
However, if X is not connected, then there are more than two maps Top(X, ∗` ∗). For
example, if X = [0, 1] ∪[2, 3], then there are four functions X →∗` ∗. So the set
Top(X, ∗` ∗) is not equal to Top(X, ∗) ` Top(X, ∗). These observations motivate a deﬁ-
nition of connectedness that makes sense in any category that has coproducts, including
Top.
Theorem 2.11 A space X is connected if and only if the functor Top(X, −) preserves co-
products.
For more information, the categorically minded reader is encouraged to consult the entry
on connectedness at the nLab (Stacey et al., 2019).
Wrapping up this brief excursion on constructions, we’ve seen that connectedness and
path-connectedness are preserved by products and quotients but are not preserved by sub-
spaces or coproducts. With that in mind, let’s now turn our attention to a local version of
connectedness.

46
Chapter 2
2.1.4
Local (Path) Connectedness
Deﬁnition 2.3 A topological space is locally connected (or locally path connected ) if and
only if for each x ∈X and every neighborhood U ⊆X of x, there is a connected (or path
connected) neighborhood V of x with V ⊆U.
Example 2.2 Consider the graph of f x = sin(1/x) where x > 0 along with part of the
y axis ranging from (0, −1) to (0, 1). This space, called the topologist’s sine curve, is
connected but not path connected. See ﬁgure 2.1.
...
Figure 2.1
The topologist’s sine curve
If a space X is locally connected, then the connected components are open, as can be
easily veriﬁed. This has several consequences. For one, theorem 2.10 implies that locally
connected spaces are the coproducts of their connected components. We also have the
following.
Theorem 2.12 In any locally path connected topological space, the connected compo-
nents and path components are the same.
Proof. Exercise.
Example 2.3 The topologist’s sine curve from example 2.2, then, is connected but not
locally connected. However, the space [0, 1]∪[2, 3] is locally connected but not connected.
The previous example illustrates that neither connectedness nor local connectedness im-
plies the other, and the same is true if we replace “connected” with “path connected.”
Example 2.4 Let C =  1
n | n ∈N	 ∪{0}, and set X = (C × [0, 1]) ∪([0, 1] × {0}). Then
X, called the comb space, is path connected but not locally path connected. See ﬁgure 2.2.

Connectedness and Compactness

On the other hand, the set [0, 1] ∪[2, 3] in R with the subspace topology is locally path
connected but not path connected.

2.2
Hausdorff Spaces
In the previous section, we discussed connectedness, which in a sense describes when
a space can or cannot be separated into nonoverlapping “chunks.” The next topological
property arises when one seeks for separation at the level of individual points.
Deﬁnition 2.4 A space X is Hausdorff if and only if for every two points x and y, there
exist disjoint open sets U and V with x ∈U and y ∈V.
x
y
First, it’s good to check that Hausdorff deﬁnes a topological property but not a homotopy
invariant property. Then we might wonder which constructions preserve the Hausdorff
property. One ﬁnds that subspaces of Hausdorff spaces are Hausdorff, products of Haus-
dorff spaces are Hausdorff, and coproducts of Hausdorff spaces are Hausdorff, but quo-
tients of Hausdorff spaces are not necessarily Hausdorff. In fact, quotients of Hausdorff
spaces are the source of non-Hausdorff spaces throughout the mathematical world. But
quotients and Hausdorff spaces do interact well in the following sense.
Theorem 2.13 Every space X is the quotient of a Hausdorff space H.
Proof. Omitted. See Shimrat (1956).

48
Chapter 2
Example 2.5 Metric spaces are Hausdorff. To see this, let x and y be points in a metric
space. If x , y, then d := d(x, y) > 0 and B(x, d
2) and B(y, d
2) are disjoint open sets
separating x and y.
Theorem 2.14 A space X is Hausdorff if and only if the diagonal map ∆: X →X × X is
closed.
Proof. Exercise.
The Hausdorff property interacts with other topological properties in some far-reaching
ways. In particular, it gives rise to rich results when combined with compactness.
2.3
Compactness
In this section we introduce the notion of compactness, along with examples and theorems.
Admittedly, the proofs in this section have a classical rather than a categorical ﬂavor. But
don’t fret. Instead, we encourage you to eagerly anticipate chapter 5 where we’ll revisit
compact Hausdorff spaces in great categorical detail.
2.3.1
Deﬁnitions, Theorems, and Examples
Deﬁnition 2.5 A collection U of open subsets of a space X is called an open cover for
X if and only if the union of sets in U contains X. The space X is compact if and only if
every open cover of X has a ﬁnite subcover.
Theorem 2.15 If X is compact and f : X →Y is continuous, then f X is compact.
Proof. Exercise.
Corollary 2.15.1 Compactness is a topological property.
One way to think of compact spaces is that they are somehow small—not in terms of
cardinality but in terms of roominess. For example, if you squeeze an inﬁnite set of points
into the unit interval, they’ll get cramped—for any ε > 0, there are two points that are less
than ε apart. But it’s easy to ﬁt an inﬁnite number of points in the real line so that they’re
all spread out. Indeed, the unit interval is compact while the real line is not. This idea is
summarized in the next theorem. First, a piece of terminology. A point x is called a limit
point of a space X if every neighborhood of x contains a point of X ∖{x}.
The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem
Every inﬁnite set in a compact space has a limit
point.
Proof. Suppose that F is an inﬁnite subset with no limit points. If x is not a limit point
of F and x < F, there is an open set Ux around x that misses F. If x is not a limit
point of F and x ∈F, then there is an open set Ux with Ux ∩F = {x}. Then {Ux}x∈X

Connectedness and Compactness
49
is an open cover of X. Notice that there can be no ﬁnite subcover Ux1, . . . , Uxn since
(Ux1 ∪· · · ∪Uxn) ∩F = {x1, . . . , xn}, and cannot contain the inﬁnite set F.
Example 2.6 Note that compactness is not necessary in the previous theorem, as there
exist noncompact spaces for which every inﬁnite subset has a limit point. For instance,
take R with topology {(x, ∞) : x ∈R} together with ∅and R. This space is not compact,
but any set (inﬁnite or not) has a limit point (inﬁnitely many, in fact).
In general, directly checking if a space is compact can be tricky. The following deﬁnition
sets the stage for an alternate criterion, as described in the next theorem.
Deﬁnition 2.6 Let S be a collection of sets. We say that S has the ﬁnite intersection
property if and only if for every ﬁnite subcollection A1, . . . , An ⊆S, the intersection A1 ∩
· · · ∩An , ∅. We abbreviate the ﬁnite intersection property by FIP.
Theorem 2.16 A space X is compact if and only if every collection of closed subsets of X
with the FIP has nonempty intersection.
Proof. Exercise.
Here’s yet another way to check for compactness.
Theorem 2.17 Closed subsets of compact spaces are compact.
Proof. Let X be compact with C ⊆X closed and suppose U = {Uα}α∈A is an open cover
of C. Then X ∖C together with U forms an open cover of X. Since X is compact, there
are ﬁnitely many sets {Ui}n
i=1 in U, possibly together with X ∖C, which covers X. Thus
{Ui}n
i=1 is a ﬁnite subcover for C.
Now we’re ready to see how compactness and the Hausdorff property interact. To start,
compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are quite nice—they can be separated from points by
open sets.
Theorem 2.18 Let X be Hausdorff. For any point x ∈X and any compact set K ⊆X ∖{x}
there exist disjoint open sets U and V with x ∈U and K ⊆V.
Proof. Let x ∈X and let K ⊊X be compact. For each y ∈K, there are disjoint open sets
Uy and Vy with x ∈Uy and y ∈Vy. The collection {Vy} is an open cover of K; hence there
is a ﬁnite subcover {V1, . . . , Vn}. Let U = U1 ∩· · · ∩Un and V = V1 ∪· · · ∪Vn. Then U
and V are disjoint open sets with x ∈U and K ⊆V.
This theorem quickly gives rise to two important corollaries.
Corollary 2.18.1 Compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are closed.
Proof. Exercise.

50
Chapter 2
Corollary 2.18.2 If X is compact and Y is Hausdorff, then every map f : X →Y is
closed.1 In particular,
• if f is injective, then it is an embedding;
• if f is surjective, then it is a quotient map;
• if f is bijective, then it is a homeomorphism.
Proof. Let f : X →Y be a map from a compact space to a Hausdorff space, and let C ⊆X
be closed. Then C is compact, so fC is compact, so fC is closed.
As you’ll recall from example 1.13, not every continuous bijection f : X →Y is a homeo-
morphism. The previous corollary guarantees us that such maps are homeomorphisms
whenever X is compact and Y is Hausdorff.
2.3.2
Constructions and Compactness
As with our discussion on connectedness, we are also interested in the preservation of
compactness under the four constructions: subspaces, quotients, products, and coproducts.
Subspaces of compact spaces are not compact in general, but we saw in theorem 2.17 that
closed subspaces of compact spaces are compact. You’ll also realize that we’ve proved
that quotients of compact spaces are compact. Coproducts of compact spaces are certainly
not compact—just look at the coproduct of inﬁnitely many copies of a point. But what
about products? There are a few interesting things to explain here, and we’ll start with
Tychonoff’s theorem and some of its corollaries.
Tychonoff’s Theorem 1 The product of compact spaces is compact.
Proof. See section 3.4.
Corollary 2.18.3 (Heine-Borel Theorem)
A subset of Rn is compact if and only if it is
closed and bounded.
Proof. Suppose that K ⊂Rn is compact. Since the cover of K consisting of open balls
centered at the origin of all possible radii must have a ﬁnite subcover, K must be bounded.
Since Rn is Hausdorff and all compact subsets of a Hausdorff space must be closed, K is
closed.
Conversely (and this is the part that uses the Tychonoff theorem), suppose that K ⊂Rn
is closed and bounded. Since K is bounded, the projection of K onto the ith coordinate is
bounded; that is, for each i there’s an interval [ai, bi] containing πiK. Then K ⊆[a1, b1] ×
[a2, b2] × · · · × [an, bn]. Since each set [ai, bi] is compact, the Tychonoff theorem implies
1 The map f is closed if fC is closed whenever C ⊆X is closed. See exercise 1.14 at the end of chapter 1.

that the product [a1, b1] × [a2, b2] × · · · × [an, bn] is compact. Since any closed subset of a
compact space is compact, we conclude that K is compact.
Corollary 2.18.4 Continuous functions from compact spaces to R have both a global max-
imum and a global minimum.
Proof. Exercise.
The characterization of compact subsets of Rn as closed and bounded may be familiar
from analysis, but recall that bounded is not a topological property! For example, there is
a homeomorphism of topological spaces R  (0, 1), yet R is not a bounded metric space
while (0, 1) is. It’s also not a homotopy invariant, and neither is compactness.
Example 2.7 Like any space whose underlying set is ﬁnite, the one-point set ∗is compact.
Since R is not compact but is homotopy equivalent to ∗, we see that compactness is not a
homotopy invariant.
Finally, we have the so-called Tube Lemma, which isn’t a corollary of Tychonoff, but it
does concern compact sets and products. First, here’s an example.
Example 2.8 Let U be the interior of the triangle with corners (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, 1)—
U := {(x, y) ⊂R2 | 0 < x < 1, 0 < y < x}
—and consider the set A ×

is not contained in U for any ε > 0. But if A were compact. . ..
The Tube Lemma
For any open set U ⊆X × Y and any set K × {y} ⊆U with K ⊆X
compact, there exist open sets V ⊆X and W ⊆Y with K × {y} ⊆V × W ⊆U.
Proof. For each point (x, y) ∈K ×{y}, there are open sets Vx ⊆X and Wx ⊆Y with (x, y) ∈
Vx × Wx ⊆U. Then, {Vx}x∈K is an open cover of K; take a ﬁnite subcover {V1, . . . , Vn}.
Then V = V1∪· · ·∪Vn and W = W1∩· · ·∩Wn are open sets with K ×{y} ⊆V ×W ⊆U.
We now close by brieﬂy mentioning the local version of compactness.
2.3.3
Local Compactness
We will deﬁne local compactness by way of saying that “spaces that are locally compact
are spaces whose neighborhoods look like neighborhoods of compact spaces.”
Deﬁnition 2.7 A space X is locally compact if and only if for every point x ∈X there
exists a compact set K and a neighborhood U with x ∈U ⊆K.
Example 2.9 Every compact space is locally compact, as is every discrete space. Also, Rn
is locally compact; however, the real line with the lower limit topology Tll (example 1.3)
is not, as the reader can verify.

52
Chapter 2
Note that the image of a locally compact space need not be locally compact. For example,
consider the map id: (R, Tdiscrete) →(R, Tll). Nonetheless, locally compact is a topological
property, as one can verify. For Hausdorff spaces, local compactness is much stronger.
Theorem 2.19 Suppose X is locally compact and Hausdorff. Then for every point x ∈X
and every neighborhood U of x, there exists a neighborhood V of x such that the closure V
is compact and x ∈V ⊆V ⊆U.
Proof. This is a corollary of theorem 2.18 and the deﬁnition of local compactness.
Lastly, we mention that the product and quotient topologies are not compatible in the sense
of exercise 1.11 at the end of chapter 1, but the hypothesis of locally compact and Hausdorff
makes the situation much better.
Theorem 2.20 If X1 ↠Y1 and X2 ↠Y2 are quotient maps and Y1 and X2 are locally
compact and Hausdorff, then X1 × X2 ↠Y1 × Y2 is a quotient map.
Proof. We postpone the proof until theorem 5.7 in chapter 5.

Introduction.
Chapter 2 featured various properties of topological spaces and explored their
interactions with a few categorical constructions. In this chapter we’ll again discuss some topological
properties, this time with an eye toward more ﬁne-grained ideas. As introduced early in a study of
analysis, properties of nice topological spaces X can be detected by sequences of points in X. We’ll
be interested in some of these properties and the extent to which sequences sufﬁce to detect them.
But take note of the adjective “nice” here. What if X is any topological space, not just a nice one?
Unfortunately, sequences are not well suited for characterizing properties in arbitrary spaces. But all
is not lost. A sequence can be replaced with a more general construction—a ﬁlter—which is much
better suited for the task. In this chapter we introduce ﬁlters and highlight some of their strengths.
Our goal is to spend a little time inside of spaces to discuss ideas that may be familiar from analysis.
For this reason, this chapter contains less category theory than others. On the other hand, we’ll see in
section 3.3 that ﬁlters are a bit like functors and hence like generalizations of points. This perspective
thus gives us a coarse-grained approach to investigating ﬁne-grained ideas. We’ll go through some
of these basic ideas—closure, limit points, sequences, and more—rather quickly in sections 3.1 and
3.2. Later in section 3.2 we’ll see exactly why sequences don’t sufﬁce to detect certain properties
in all spaces. We’ll also discover those “nice” spaces for which they do. Section 3.3 introduces
ﬁlters with some examples and results about them. These results include the claim that ﬁlters, unlike
sequences, do sufﬁce to characterize certain properties. Finally, in section 3.4 we’ll use ﬁlters to
share a delightfully short proof of Tychonoff’s theorem.
3.1
Closure and Interior
Here are a few basic deﬁnitions, which may be familiar from analysis. Given any subset
B of a space X, two topological constructions suggest themselves. There is the closure
B which is the smallest closed set containing B, and there is the interior B◦which is the
largest open set contained in B. When B = X, we say B is dense in X. If

B
◦= ∅, we say
B is nowhere dense.

56
Chapter 3
Notice that the deﬁnition of a topology guarantees that the interior and closure exist. For
example, because a topology is closed under arbitrary unions, the interior B◦is precisely
the union of all open subsets of B. Contrast this with the ideas of a “largest closed set”
contained in B and a “smallest open set” containing B, which might not exist.
A point x is called a limit point of a set B if every open set around x contains a point of
B ∖{x}. The closure B consists of B together with all of its limit points. A point x is called
a boundary point of B if every open set containing x contains both a point in B and a point
in the complement of B.
Limit points help to understand closures and interiors. So, taking a cue from analysis,
let’s turn to a study of sequences in an attempt to characterize limit points.
3.2
Sequences
Deﬁnition 3.1 Let X be a topological space. A sequence in X is a function x: N →X. We
usually write xn for x(n) and may denote the sequence by {xn}. A sequence {xn} converges
to z ∈X if and only if for every open set U containing z, there exists an N ∈N so that if
n ≥N then xn ∈U. When {xn} converges to z ∈X we’ll write {xn} →z. A subsequence of
a sequence x is the composition xk where k: N →N is an increasing injection. We’ll write
xki for xk(i) and denote the subsequence by {xki}.
Here are a few examples.
Example 3.1 Let A = {1, 2, 3} with the topology T = ∅, {1}, {1, 2}, A	. The constant
sequence 1, 1, 1, 1, . . . converges to 1. It also converges to 2 and to 3.
Example 3.2 Consider Z with the coﬁnite topology. For any m ∈Z, the constant sequence
m, m, m, . . . converges to m and only to m. Indeed if l , m, then the set R ∖m is an open
set around l containing no elements of the sequence.
However, the sequence {n} = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . converges to m for every m ∈Z. To see this,
let m be any integer, and let U be a neighborhood of m. Since Z ∖U is ﬁnite, there can
only be ﬁnitely many natural numbers in Z ∖U. Let N be larger than the greatest natural
number in Z ∖U. Then n ∈U whenever n ≥N, proving that {n} →m.
Example 3.3 Consider R with the usual topology. If {xn} →x, then {xn} does not converge
to any number y , x. To prove it, note we can always ﬁnd disjoint open sets U and V with
x ∈U and y ∈V. (We can be explicit if necessary: U = (x −c, x + c) and V = (y −c, y + c)
where c =
1
2|x −y|.) Then there is a number N so that xn ∈U for all n ≥N. Since
U ∩V = ∅, the set V cannot contain any xn for n ≥N, and hence {xn} does not converge
to y.
As we’ll see below, sequences can be used to detect certain properties of spaces, subsets
of spaces, and functions between spaces. But before continuing, it will be helpful to ﬁrst
introduce a couple more topological properties—two of the so-called “separation” axioms.

Deﬁnition 3.2 We say
(i)
A topological space X is T0 if and only if for every pair of points x, y ∈X there
exists an open set containing one, but not both, of them.
x
y
(ii)
A topological space X is T1 if and only if for every pair of points x, y ∈X there exist
open sets U and V with x ∈U, y ∈V with x < V and y < U.
x
y
We could have added a third property to the list. A space X with the property that for
every pair of points x, y ∈X there exist open sets U and V with x ∈U, y ∈V with
U ∩V = ∅is sometimes called T2, but we’ve already named the property Hausdorff,
after Felix Hausdorff who originally used the axiom in his deﬁnition of “neighborhood
spaces” (Hausdorff and Aumann, 1914). Note that T0, T1, and T2 all deﬁne topological
properties.
Here are a few theorems about sequences that might evoke familiar results from analysis.
Some of the proofs are left as exercises. You’ll want to keep the examples above in mind.
Theorem 3.1 A space X is T1 if and only if for any x ∈X, the constant sequence x, x, x, . . .
converges to x and only to x.
Proof. Suppose X is T1 and x ∈X. It’s clear that x, x, x, . . . →x. Let y , x. Then there
exists an open set U with y ∈U and x < U. Therefore, x, x, x, . . . cannot converge to y.
For the converse, suppose X is not T1. Then there exist two distinct points x and y for
which every open set around y contains x. Thus x, x, x, . . . →y.
Theorem 3.2 If X is Hausdorff, then sequences in X have at most one limit.
Proof. Let X be Hausdorff and suppose {xn} is a sequence such that {xn} →x and {xn} →y.
If x , y, then there are disjoint open sets U and V with x ∈U and y ∈V. Since {xn} →x
there is a number N so that xn ∈U for all n ≥N. Since {xn} →y there is a number K so
that xn ∈U for all n ≥K. Let M = max{N, K}. Since M ≥N and M ≥K we have xM ∈U
and xM ∈V, contradicting the fact that U and V are disjoint.
Theorem 3.3 If {xn} is a sequence in A that converges to x, then x ∈A.
Proof. Exercise.

58
Chapter 3
Theorem 3.4 If f : X →Y is continuous, then for all sequences {xn} that converge to x in
X, the sequence {f xn} converges to f x in Y.
Proof. Exercise.
You’ll notice that theorem 3.1 is an if-and-only-if theorem that characterizes the T1 prop-
erty with a statement about sequences. So you might wonder if sequences are also enough
to characterize Hausdorff spaces, closed sets, and continuous functions. That is, do theo-
rems 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 have if-and-only-if-versions, too? The answer is no.
Example 3.4 Sequences don’t sufﬁce to detect Hausdorff spaces. Consider R with the
cocountable topology. This space is not Hausdorff, and yet convergent sequences have
unique limits.
Example 3.5 Sequences don’t sufﬁce to detect closed sets. Let
X = [0, 1][0,1] := {functions f : [0, 1] →[0, 1]}
with the product topology, and let A be the subset of X consisting of functions whose graphs
are “sawtooths” with vertices on the x axis at a ﬁnite number of points {0, r1, . . . , rn, 1} and
spikes of height 1, as in ﬁgure 3.1. The zero function is in A, but there is no sequence {fn}
in A converging to it.

Example 3.6 Sequences don’t sufﬁce to detect continuous functions. Let X = [0, 1][0,1] :=
{functions f : [0, 1] →[0, 1]} with the product topology, and let Y be the subspace of X
consisting of integrable functions. The function I : Y →R deﬁned by I f =
R 1
0 f is not a
continuous function but {I fn} →I f whenever {fn} →f.

Sequences don’t sufﬁce to detect the Hausdorff property, closure, and continuity in these
examples because the spaces in question have too many open sets around each point for
their topological properties to be adequately probed by sequences. But for spaces without
too many open sets around each point, sequences do sufﬁce to characterize their properties.
These spaces are called ﬁrst countable.
Deﬁnition 3.3 Let X be a space. A collection of open sets B is called a neighborhood
base for x ∈X if and only if for every open set O containing x, there exists an open set
U ∈B with x ∈U ⊆O. A space X is called ﬁrst countable if and only if every point has a
countable neighborhood base. A space X is called second countable if and only if it has a
countable basis.
Example 3.7 By deﬁnition, the set Tx of open neighborhoods of a point x in a space X is
a neighborhood base for x.
Example 3.8 Every metric space is ﬁrst countable since the open balls around x of radius
1, 1
2, 1
3, . . . form a countable neighborhood base.
Example 3.9 An n-dimensional manifold is a second countable Hausdorff topological
space with the property that every point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to Rn.
Two examples of nonﬁrst countable spaces were given in example 3.4, example 3.5, and
example 3.6; namely, R with the cocountable topology and [0, 1][0,1] with the product
topology. But in ﬁrst countable spaces such as metric spaces, sequences do sufﬁce to
characterize separation, closure, and continuity properties. In other words, theorem 3.2,
theorem 3.3, and theorem 3.4 do have if-and-only-if versions in this special context.
Theorem 3.5 Let X be a ﬁrst countable space. Then X is Hausdorff if and only if every
sequence has at most one limit.
Proof. Suppose that X is ﬁrst countable. If X is not Hausdorff, there exist points x and
y that cannot be separated by open sets. Let U1, U2, . . . be a neighborhood base of x and
V1, V2, . . . be a neighborhood base for y. For every n choose a point xn ∈Un ∩Vn , ∅.
The sequence {xn} has a subsequence that converges to x and to y.
Theorem 3.6 Let X be a ﬁrst countable space and let A ⊆X. A point x ∈A if and only if
there exists a sequence {xn} in A with {xn} →x.
Proof. Exercise.
Theorem 3.7 Suppose X and Y are ﬁrst countable. A function f : X →Y is continuous if
and only if for every sequence {xn} in X with {xn} →x, the sequence {f xn} →f x.
Proof. Exercise.

60
Chapter 3
The reason sequences characterize separation, closure, and continuity in ﬁrst countable
spaces but not in arbitrary spaces is simply because sequences are countable. If, however,
we want the previous three if-and-only-if theorems to hold in a wider context, then we’ll
want a generalization of sequences—one that more accurately reﬂects the range of pos-
sibilities for convergence. This generalization is the topic of the next section. To help
introduce the ideas, let’s make a simple observation.
Given a sequence {xn} in a space X, consider the collection of sets the sequence is even-
tually inside of:
Exn := {A ⊆X | there exists an N so that xn ∈A for all n ≥N}
(3.1)
Now here’s the key:
The sequence {xn} converges to a point x if and only if the neighborhood base Tx is con-
tained in Exn.
Understanding convergence, therefore, amounts to understanding the set Exn. This immedi-
ately suggests how one might attempt to generalize sequences: abstract the notion of “the
set of sets the sequence is eventually inside of.” Cartan (1937b) did just that in 1937, when
he introduced an appropriate generalization of sequences well suited to studying conver-
gence: ﬁlters. As we’ll soon see, ﬁlters are just what’s needed to obtain the three analogous
if-and-only-if theorems for all spaces, not just ﬁrst countable ones.
3.3
Filters and Convergence
A ﬁlter is like an algebraic road map with (perhaps rough) directions to points or places in
a space. More precisely, it is a certain subset of a poset (a partially ordered set). In this
chapter, the poset we focus on is the powerset of a set X. That is, we consider ﬁlters of
subsets of a given set. Here is the deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.4 A ﬁlter on a set X is a collection F ⊆2X that is
(i)
downward directed: A, B ∈F implies there exists C ∈F such that C ⊆A ∩B
(ii)
nonempty: F , ∅
(iii)
upward closed: A ∈F and A ⊆B implies B ∈F
An additional property is often useful:
(iv)
proper: there exists A ⊆X such that A < F
So a ﬁlter on X is a downward directed, nonempty, upward closed subset of the powerset
2X. A couple of comments are in order. Being downward directed and upward closed
implies that ﬁlters are closed under ﬁnite intersections. We can also rephrase properness
as the requirement that ∅< F . For example, 2X is itself a ﬁlter and is well named the
improper ﬁlter on X. A set that is only downward directed and nonempty is called a
ﬁlterbase. Any ﬁlterbase generates a ﬁlter; just take the upward closure of the base.

Limits of Sequences and Filters
61
In chapter 0, it was noted that any poset can be viewed as a category; objects are elements
in the set, and morphisms are provided by the partial order. So there’s hope that ﬁlters have
a categorical description. Indeed they do. It starts with the observation that the poset 2X
has the property that every pair of elements A, B ∈2X has a meet (a greatest lower bound),
namely their intersection A ∩B. We can deﬁne another poset also having this property.
Consider the two-element poset 2 := {0 ≤1}. For a, b ∈2 deﬁne their meet a ∧b by
0 ∧0 = 0
0 ∧1 = 0
1 ∧0 = 0
1 ∧1 = 1
Every monotone function f : 2X →2 that respects this structure—that is, that satisﬁes
f(A ∩B) = f A ∧f B—deﬁnes a ﬁlter, namely the preimage f −11. Verifying this claim is a
simple exercise. In the language of order theory, f is called a meet-semilattice homomor-
phism. In the language of category theory, it is called a continuous functor.
Indeed, the posets 2X and 2 are categories, and a functor between them is precisely a
monotone function. We’ll see in chapter 4 that a meet is an example of a more general
categorical construction called a limit, and a functor that respects limits is, with inspiration
from theorem 3.4, called continuous. Filters thus arise from continuous functors 2X →2.
Example 3.10 For any set X, the trivial ﬁlter F = {X} is a proper ﬁlter. More generally,
for any nonempty subset A ⊆X, the set of all sets containing A is a proper ﬁlter.
Example 3.11 Another example of a proper ﬁlter is the eventuality ﬁlter Exn associated to
the sequence {xn} from equation 3.1. It’s aptly named since it’s the collection of all sets
that the sequence eventually remains in.
Example 3.12 The coﬁnite subsets of a set X
F := {A ⊆X | X ∖A ﬁnite}
deﬁne a ﬁlter called the Fr´echet ﬁlter. If X is inﬁnite, then the Fre´chet ﬁlter is proper.
Example 3.13 Given a topological space (X, T ), the open neighborhoods Tx of a point
x form a ﬁlterbase, though they generally do not form a ﬁlter. The reason is simply that
(usually) not every set containing an open neighborhood of x is open. But there is some
ambiguity in the mathematics community on this point. Kelley (1955) deﬁnes “a neigh-
borhood of x” to mean exactly “a set containing an open set containing x.” Others, such
as Munkres (2000), prefer all neighborhoods be open neighborhoods. In our language, the
ﬁlterbase Tx generates the ﬁlter of (not necessarily open) neighborhoods of x.
We began our discussion about ﬁlters with an observation about convergence: a sequence
in a topological space converges if and only if its eventuality ﬁlter contains the ﬁlterbase
Tx. This motivates the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.5 A ﬁlter F on a topological space (X, T ) converges to x if and only if F
reﬁnes Tx, that is if Tx ⊆F . When F converges to x we’ll write F →x.

62
Chapter 3
Example 3.14 The real-valued sequence {xn} := {1, −1, 1
2, −1, 1
4, −1, 1
8, . . .} does not con-
verge, whereas the subsequence {x2n} = {1, 1
2, 1
4, 1
8, . . .} does. We can see this by reasoning
with eventuality ﬁlters, which isn’t so different from reasoning with sequences. Here’s the
thing to notice: the eventuality ﬁlter Ex2n is the set of all subsets A ⊂R for which there
exists an N so that
1
2n ∈A for all n ≥N. It’s straightforward to check that Ex2n →0.
However, the eventuality ﬁlter Exn has the same description as Ex2n, except each A must
also include −1. So Exn ⊆Ex2n.
This example illustrates that passing to a subsequence increases the size of an eventuality
ﬁlter since the membership condition is weaker. At the extreme end of this, the improper
ﬁlter F = 2X converges to every point in X! (And yet it is not the eventuality ﬁlter of any
sequence.)
At this juncture, you’ll recall our earlier claim that ﬁlters sufﬁce to give a characterization
of the Hausdorff property, closure, and continuity. The proofs of the ﬁrst two are now
available.
Theorem 3.8 A space is Hausdorff if and only if limits of convergent proper ﬁlters are
unique.
Proof. Suppose X is Hausdorff and that a proper ﬁlter F converges to both x and y with
x , y. Then there are open neighborhoods U of x and V of y with U ∩V = ∅. By
convergence, U, V ∈F . Since F is a ﬁlter, ∅= U ∩V ∈F , which contradicts F being
proper.
However, if X is not Hausdorff then there are two distinct points x and y that cannot be
separated by open sets. Let
B = {U ∩V | x ∈U, y ∈V with U and V open}
Note that B is downward directed and nonempty, so it is a ﬁlterbase. The ﬁlter F generated
by the collection B converges to both x and y.
Theorem 3.9 Let X be a space with A ⊆X. A point x ∈A if and only if there exists a
proper ﬁlter F containing A with F →x.
Proof. First recall that x ∈A if and only if every neighborhood of x nontrivially intersects
A or equivalently if and only if the ﬁlterbase B = {U ∩A}U∈Tx does not contain the empty
set. So if x ∈A, then simply generate a proper ﬁlter from B. Conversely, if there is a proper
ﬁlter F that converges to x and contains A, then B ⊆F and so B cannot contain the empty
set.
In the next theorem we’ll show that ﬁlters also sufﬁce to detect continuity. But ﬁrst we
need to understand functions in the context of ﬁlters.

Deﬁnition 3.6 Given a ﬁlter F on X and a function f : X →Y, the set {f A | A ∈F } of
images of elements of F form a ﬁlterbase. The ﬁlter f∗F generated by this base is the
pushforward of F with respect to f. Explicitly:
f∗F := {B ⊆Y | there exists A ∈F with f A ⊆B}
In this deﬁnition, the “generated by” is necessary since the set of images itself may not
form a ﬁlter. For example, if f is not surjective, then the images don’t contain Y and
therefore cannot be upward closed.
Example 3.15 As a simple example, f∗Exn = Ef xn. In other words, the pushforward of the
eventuality ﬁlter of a sequence is the eventuality ﬁlter of the pushforward of that sequence.
Now here’s the desired theorem.
Theorem 3.10 A function f : X →Y is continuous if and only if for every ﬁlter F on X,
if F →x, then f∗F →f x.
Proof. Let F be a ﬁlter on X with F →x, and suppose f : X →Y is continuous. We
want to show Tf x ⊆f∗F ; that is, for any B ∈Tf x there exists a set A ∈F with f A ⊆B. So
choose A = f −1B. Continuity implies f −1Tf x ⊆Tx, which means A ∈Tx. The statement
F →x means Tx ⊆F and so A ∈F .
Conversely, suppose that whenever F →x we have f∗F →f x for any ﬁlter F . Take F
to be the ﬁlter generated by Tx to ﬁnd that f∗F →f x, which means Tf x ⊆f∗F . Thus for
every B ∈Tf x, there exists a set A in Tx with f A ⊆B. This proves that f is continuous.
Filters, therefore, do indeed give the triad of theorems for all spaces.

Having reached our goal, you might expect the chapter to conclude here. But not so fast.
There’s much more to ﬁlters. We’ve used them to study convergence, thereby promoting
some “if, then” theorems about sequences to “if and only if” theorems about ﬁlters. But
ﬁlters also shine particularly bright in discussions of compactness. To illustrate, we will
use ﬁlters in the next section to provide a wonderfully short proof of Tychonoff’s theorem,
which was introduced—but not proven—in chapter 2.

Tychonoff’s Theorem
The goal of this section is to prove the following theorem.
Tychonoff’s Theorem 2 Given any collection {Xα}α∈A of compact spaces, the product
Q
α∈A Xα is compact.
It’s easier to prove that the product of ﬁnitely many compact spaces is compact than it
is to prove the general case. For example, in Munkres’ Topology (2000), compactness is
introduced in chapter 3, where it is proven that the product of ﬁnitely many compact spaces
is compact (Theorem 26.7). For the proof of the general case, the intrepid reader must
wait until chapter 5 (Theorem 37.3), with a full chapter on countability and separation
interrupting. Schaum’s Outline (Lipschutz, 1965) states Tychonoff’s theorem in chapter
12, but the proof is banished to the exercises. One must use the axiom of choice (or its
equivalent) to prove the general case (see our theorem 3.14).
We will present a variation on Cartan’s proof (1937a) by way of a little more ﬁlter tech-
nology. That technology is a particular kind of ﬁlter called an ultraﬁlter, which we intro-
duce next. We’ll take a leisurely stroll through the ideas, pointing out notable results along
the way. In a grand ﬁnale, Tychonoff’s theorem is proven in a few short lines in section
3.4.2.
3.4.1
Ultraﬁlters and Compactness
An ultraﬁlter is simply a ﬁlter that is maximal. The terms are synonymous.
Deﬁnition 3.7 A proper ﬁlter on a set is an ultraﬁlter if and only if it is not properly
contained in any other proper ﬁlter.
This deﬁnition is second order since it deals with a quantiﬁcation over subsets of a set. In
practice, we’d like to work with a ﬁrst-order deﬁnition—a characterization of an ultraﬁlter
that doesn’t require us to compare it to all other ﬁlters. Happily, such a characterization
exists.
Proposition 3.1 A ﬁlter U on a set X is an ultraﬁlter if and only if for every subset A ⊆X
the following condition holds: A < U if and only if there exists B ∈U with A ∩B = ∅.
Proof. Let U be an ultraﬁlter. Then A < U if and only if the ﬁlter generated by U ∪{A}
is the powerset 2X. Since the generated ﬁlter consists of all sets containing an intersection
of the form B ∩A for some B ∈U, this is equivalent to the statement that the empty set
contains B ∩A for some B ∈U. Since the empty set is a subset of any set, the result
follows.
Conversely, suppose U is a ﬁlter on X satisfying the condition, and let F be a ﬁlter
properly containing U. So there is at least one A ∈F which is not in U. By hypothesis,
there must also exist a B ∈U disjoint from A. But ∅= A ∩B ∈F , and so F is the
improper ﬁlter by upward closure.

65
Here’s a nonexample followed by an example.
Example 3.16 If X has more than one point, then the trivial ﬁlter {X} is not an ultraﬁlter.
Example 3.17 Given any x in a set X, the principal ﬁlter at x deﬁned as {A ⊆X | x ∈A}
is an ultraﬁlter.
The next example highlights a point we wish to emphasize. In this chapter, we deﬁned
ﬁlters on powersets, but the deﬁnition of “downward directed, nonempty, upward closed”
makes perfect sense in any poset. Keep this in mind. Filters in more general posets are
useful, natural objects of study. This is illustrated well by Riemann integration.
Example 3.18 Let f : [a, b] →R be a bounded function and let (P, ⪯) be the poset of
partitions of [a, b] ordered by reﬁnement. Any partition P = {a = x0 < x1 < · · · < xn = b}
yields two real numbers:
uP := Pn
i=1 sup   f|[xi−1,xi]
(xi −xi−1)
lP := Pn
i=1 inf  f|[xi−1,xi]
(xi −xi−1)
Similarly, any ﬁlter of partitions in P deﬁnes a pair of ﬁlters on R:
Bu(F ) = {U ⊆R | there exists Q ∈F such that Q ⪯P implies uP ∈U}
and
Bl(F ) = {U ⊆R | there exists Q ∈F such that Q ⪯P implies lP ∈U}
For any ultraﬁlter U in P, the ﬁlters Bu(U) and Bl(U) converge to real numbers. The
function f is Riemann integrable if and only if they converge to the same value. In such a
case, that value is called the integral
R b
a f. So ultraﬁlters and the natural ordering of parti-
tions allow us to replace the typical “partition norms” or “meshes” with a direct handling
of the underlying orders. (As is often the case with categorical constructions, ﬁlters are
reﬂective of what we have, not necessarily the computation of what we want.)
So just remember that a thorough discussion of ﬁlters can—and does—exist outside the
context of powersets. But the powerset context is a very nice one: ﬁlters on powersets
have special properties not shared by more general ﬁlters (see exercise 3.13 at the end of
the chapter). In particular, because our ﬁlters are on powersets, the property of maximality
is equivalent to another property—primality. In other words, ultraﬁlters on X are equiv-
alent to prime ﬁlters on X. This reformulation will give us a simple characterization of
compactness and ultimately a clean proof of Tychonoff’s theorem.
Deﬁnition 3.8 A ﬁlter F on a set X is prime if and only if it is proper and if for all
A, B ⊆X,
A ∪B ∈F implies A ∈F or B ∈F

66
Chapter 3
Theorem 3.11 A ﬁlter on X is maximal if and only if it is prime.
Proof. Suppose F is an ultraﬁlter on X and fails to be prime. Then there are A, B ⊆X
such that A∪B ∈F , but neither A nor B are in F . The latter holds if and only if there exist
sets A′, B′ ∈F with A ∩A′ = ∅= B ∩B′. This implies the intersection (A ∪B) ∩(A′ ∪B′)
is empty, which is true if and only if A ∪B < F , a clear contradiction.
Now suppose F is prime but not a maximal. Then F is properly contained in a proper
ﬁlter G. So there exists a nonempty A ∈G with A < F . Notice that X ∖A < F , for
otherwise X ∖A ∈G and if G contains both A and X ∖A, then G would not be proper. But
A ∪(X ∖A) = X ∈F , contradicting the hypothesis that F is prime.
Below, we’ll use this theorem to give a succinct characterization of compact spaces. But
despite the theorem, it will be good to keep a distinction between prime and maximal in our
minds. There are several reasons why. First, as alluded to above, prime and maximal are
not equivalent in more general settings. Keeping the two distinct in our minds strengthens
our intuition. Second, a priori prime ﬁlters are difﬁcult to construct. But as we’ll soon see,
we can always consider a maximal extension of a proper ﬁlter and then use the fact that
ultraﬁlters are prime. Finally, the theorems proven below are naturally phrased in terms of
prime ﬁlters because images commute with unions and therefore prime ﬁlters pushforward.
Keeping the distinction thus makes proving theorems easier: if you need a prime ﬁlter, just
construct one by extending a proper ﬁlter. If your construction involves pushing a ﬁlter
forward, then prime ﬁlters are your friend. Now, en route to compactness let’s prove our
claim that every proper ﬁlter can be extended to a maximal one. We’ll call on Zorn’s
lemma, whose statement we recount here.
Zorn’s Lemma
If every chain in a nonempty poset P has an upper bound, then P has a
maximal element.
The Ultraﬁlter Lemma
Every proper ﬁlter is contained in an ultraﬁlter.
Proof. Any set of ﬁlters {Fα}α∈A is bounded above by the ﬁlter generated by ﬁnite inter-
sections of elements of the {Fα}. When the set is a chain of proper ﬁlters, this upper bound
is itself proper. Given a proper ﬁlter F , chains of proper ﬁlters containing F thus have
proper upper bounds. By Zorn’s Lemma, there is a maximal ﬁlter containing F .
Corollary 3.11.1 Any inﬁnite set has a non-principal ultraﬁlter.
Proof. Consider the Fr´echet ﬁlter F := {A ⊆X | X ∖A is ﬁnite} and appeal to the Ultra-
ﬁlter Lemma to extend F to an ultraﬁlter U. Were U to contain any ﬁnite set, it would
contain its (coﬁnite) complement; hence ∅∈U, which contradicts that U is a proper
ﬁlter.

67
To appreciate this result, think back to example 3.17. When pressed, it’s hard to come up
with ultraﬁlters that are not principal. The fact that any nonprincipal ultraﬁlters exist is
not at all obvious. To produce one, we needed to appeal to the Ultraﬁlter Lemma. The
Ultraﬁlter Lemma also gives the promised characterization of compactness.
Theorem 3.12 A space X is compact if and only if every prime ﬁlter converges.
Proof. Suppose F is a prime ﬁlter that fails to converge to any x ∈X. Equivalently, sup-
pose for all x there exists Ux ∈Tx −F . The set {Ux}x∈X is an open cover. By compactness,
choose a ﬁnite subcover {Uxi}n
i=1. Then Ux1 ∪· · · ∪Uxn = X ∈F . By primality, there exists
an i such that Uxi ∈F , a contradiction.
Now suppose X is not compact. Choose a collection V of closed sets with the ﬁnite
intersection property and empty intersection. Note that for all x there exists Vx ∈V with
x < Vx. Further, by the Ultraﬁlter Lemma, V is contained in an ultraﬁlter U. However,
U ̸→x for any x, for otherwise it would imply ∅= Vx ∩Vc
x ∈U contradicting properness
of U.
You’ll recognize this theorem as a generalization of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem in-
troduced in chapter 2. Restated, it says:
If X is compact, then every sequence has a convergent subsequence.
So recalling from example 3.14 that subsequences correspond to larger (eventuality) ﬁlters
and that ﬁlters are good at promoting “if then” theorems to “if and only if” ones, you might
hope for a promotion of Bolzano-Weierstrass for ﬁlters:
X is compact if and only if every proper ﬁlter is contained in a convergent proper ﬁlter.
As a result of theorem 3.12, this is indeed the case. Where we once used convergent
subsequences, we now use prime ﬁlters. Another consequence of theorem 3.12 comes for
free when paired with theorem 3.8.
Corollary 3.12.1 A space X is compact Hausdorff if and only if every prime ﬁlter has
exactly one limit point.
This characterization of compact Hausdorff spaces is the beginning of a long categorical
tale. Sharing the full story would take us too far off course, so instead we’ll tell an abridged
version. It starts with the fact that ultraﬁlters deﬁne a functor from the category Set to itself,
a consequence of this next theorem.
Theorem 3.13 Let U be an ultraﬁlter on X and let f : X →Y. The pushforward f∗U is
an ultraﬁlter on Y.
Proof. Exercise.
Since the pushforward of an ultraﬁlter is an ultraﬁlter, the assignment β: Set →Set that
sends a set X to βX, the set of ultraﬁlters on X, deﬁnes a functor. For a morphism f : X →Y
of sets, the function βf : βX →βY sends an ultraﬁlter to its pushforward. In the special

68
Chapter 3
case when X is a compact Hausdorff space, every ultraﬁlter on X converges to exactly one
point. So you might wonder whether the assignment α: βX →X that sends an ultraﬁlter
to its unique limit point is of any interest. It is. It’s the key to unlocking an important
categorical statement:
The category of compact Hausdorff spaces is equivalent to the category of algebras for the
ultraﬁlter monad.
What’s the ultraﬁlter monad? And what does it mean to be an algebra for one? We won’t
get into the details, but we will try to give you an idea about what the statement means.
Principal ﬁlters play a principal role: since the pushforward of a principal ﬁlter is principal,
they assemble into a natural transformation η : idSet →β deﬁned by
ηX(x) = Px
where Px is the principal ﬁlter at x ∈X. There is another natural transformation µ: β◦β →
β that comes into play. We will not describe µ except to say that it works like a kind of
multiplication, and the natural transformation η behaves like a unit for this multiplication.
The triple (β, η, µ) deﬁnes something called a monad. (It should remind you of a monoid,
which also consists of three things: a set X, an associative multiplication map m: X × X →
X, and an element u: ∗→X behaving as a unit for m.) Once you have a monad, you
can deﬁne something called an algebra for that monad, and the algebras for a monad form
a category. And this category, one can show, is equivalent to the category of compact
Hausdorff spaces. Behind the curtain of this categorical connection between ultraﬁlters and
compact Hausdorff spaces is the rich theory of adjunctions. For this reason, the story will
naturally resurface later in this book: it’s closely related to the discussion of the Stone- ˇCech
compactiﬁcation in chapter 5. For an introduction to monads, see Riehl (2016), and for a
fuller account of the ultraﬁlter monad tale, see Manes (1969) and the article on compacta
at the nLab (Stacey et al., 2019). The ambitious reader may further enjoy Leinster (2013).
After this leisurely stroll through ultraﬁlters, prime ﬁlters, Bolzano-Weierstrass, and
monads, we are now ready to prove that which we set out to prove: Tychonoff’s theo-
rem.
3.4.2
A Proof of Tychonoff’s Theorem
There is a conservation of difﬁculty in mathematics. One theorem may have many proofs,
and more sophisticated tools will give more elegant proofs. Historically, the difﬁculties
in Tychonoff’s theorem were in ﬁnding the correct deﬁnition of the product topology and
in characterizing compactness. By using ultraﬁlters to characterize compactness, we are
using a sophisticated theoretical tool. The proof we share is correspondingly elegant (Cher-
noff, 1992).
If sequences had been sufﬁcient for discussions of convergence, then we could use a
ready-made argument. Just use continuity of projection maps from the product to push a
sequence forward. In each factor, pass to a subsequence, which converges by Bolzano-

Limits of Sequences and Filters
69
Weierstrass. Then in the product, form a subsequence by taking the indices common to
all the convergent subsequences in the projections, and conclude this sequence converges.
Here’s the thrill: by replacing sequences with ﬁlters and doing the work needed to develop
some understanding of the theory, this ready-made argument becomes a genuine proof.
Proof of Tychonoff’s theorem. Let {Xα}α∈A be a family of compact spaces, deﬁne X :=
Q
α∈A Xα, and let F be an ultraﬁlter on X. We must show that F converges.
The pushforward of an ultraﬁlter is an ultraﬁlter and, since the Xα are compact, there
exists xα such that (πα)∗F →xα. So by deﬁnition, for all open neighborhoods U of xα,
there exists B ∈F with παB ⊆U. Equivalently, B ⊆π−1
α U, and so π−1
α U ∈F . And every
open neighborhood of (xα)α∈A ∈X is a union of ﬁnite intersections of the π−1
α U. Therefore,
F →(xα)α∈A.
We’ll close this chapter with the remark that any treatment of Tychonoff’s theorem re-
quires some machinery from set theory. In our presentation, we hid the machinery in
Zorn’s lemma, which we used to prove the Ultraﬁlter Lemma. The reason set theory is
unavoidable is because Tychonoff’s theorem is equivalent to the axiom of choice. Without
digressing too much, we’d like to give you some idea of why Zermelo-Frankel-Choice is
equivalent to Zermelo-Frankel-Tychonoff.
3.4.3
A Little Set Theory
In any imaginable proof that the Tychonoff theorem implies the axiom of choice, one
begins with an arbitrary collection of sets and then creates a collection of compact topo-
logical spaces. The compactness of the product leads to the existence of a choice function.
In 1950, Kelley proved that the Tychonoff theorem implies the axiom of choice (Kelley,
1950) using augmented coﬁnite topologies. Here, we give an easier proof. First, we recall
the axiom of choice.
The Axiom of Choice
For any collection of nonempty sets {Xα}α∈A, the product Q
α∈A Xα
is nonempty.
Theorem 3.14 Tychonoff’s theorem is equivalent to the axiom of choice.
Proof. We used Zorn’s lemma to prove Tychonoff’s theorem. Although we don’t prove
it, the axiom of choice implies Zorn’s lemma (see exercise 3.14 at the end of the chapter),
from which it follows that Tychonoff’s theorem is implied by the axiom of choice.
To prove that Tychonoff’s theorem implies the axiom of choice, let {Xα}α∈A be a collec-
tion of nonempty sets. We need to make a bunch of compact spaces so we can apply the
Tychonoff theorem. First, add a new element to Xα called “∞α,” letting Yα = Xα ∪{∞α}.
Each set Yα can be made into a space by deﬁning the topology to be {∅, {∞α}, Xα, Yα}. Note
that Yα is compact—there are only ﬁnitely many open sets so every open cover is ﬁnite.
Thus by Tychonoff’s theorem, Y := Q
α∈A Yα is compact.

70
Chapter 3
Now consider a collection of open sets {Uβ}β∈A of Y where Uβ is the basic open set in
Y obtained by taking the product of all Yαs for α , β and putting the open set {∞β} in
the βth factor. Notice that any ﬁnite subcollection {Uβ1, . . . , Uβn} cannot cover Y, for the
function f deﬁned as follows is not in ∪n
i=1Uβi. Choose a partial function f ∈Qn
i=1 Xβi,
which is possible without the axiom of choice since the product is ﬁnite. Then extend f to
a function f ∈Y by setting f(α) = ∞α for all α , β1, . . . , βn, which is possible since we’re
not making any choices.
Therefore, the collection {Uβ} cannot cover Y. So there is a function f ∈Y not in the
∪α∈AUα. This says that for no α ∈A does fα = ∞α. Therefore, fα ∈Xα for each α, which
is a desired choice function.

Nets are an earlier generalization of sequences introduced by Moore and Smith (1922); Moore
(1915) used to address the insufﬁciency of sequences. This exercise demonstrates that nets and
proper ﬁlters are formally interchangeable.
Deﬁnition 3.9 A net is a function η: S →X whose domain is a directed set.
A directed set is deﬁned to be a pair (S, ≤), where S is a set and ≤is a relation on S satisfying:
• for all s ∈S , s ≤s,
• for all s, t, u ∈S , s ≤t and t ≤u imply s ≤u,
• for all s, t ∈S , there exists u ∈S with s ≤u and t ≤u.
We say that η converges to x if and only if its eventuality ﬁlter

maximal in the lattice on the left.
Note: Lattices without any sublattice isomorphic to one of these satisfy the distributive property
x ∧(y ∨z) = (x ∧y) ∨(x ∧z). And in particular, we may conclude that for distributive lattices,
maximal ﬁlters are prime by recycling our proof substituting unions for joins and intersections
for meets.

14. Transﬁnite Induction: Axiom of choice implies Zorn’s lemma
Ordinals are set theory’s response to the question of how things may be ordered “one after
another.” Consequently, they form the setting in which induction may be deﬁned.
Deﬁnition 3.11 A well ordering on a set S is a linear (or total) order “≤” in which every
nonempty subset has a least element. Together with order preserving—that is, monotone—
functions, well-orders form a category. Ordinals are deﬁned to be the isomorphism classes of
objects in this category. Following von Neumann, we associate to each ordinal [α] a representa-
tive well-ordering:
α := { ordinals β < α}
and will feel free to refer to “the” ordinal α as this representative well-order.
Being well-ordered amounts to having two pieces of information: there’s always a starting point
and at every element there is an unambiguously deﬁned next element—precisely the information
needed to carry out induction. It’s worth looking at the ﬁrst few familiar ordinals to get a feel
for them:
Example 3.19 First observe that there is a least ordinal, typically called 0, namely the initial
well-order ∅with the empty relation. This is the seed from which we may freely generate
ordinals.

0 →1 →· · ·
ω + 1
0 →1 →· · · ω

0 →1 →· · · ω →ω + 1
...
...
...
Some caution is in order. Note that the underlying sets of, say, ω and ω + 1 are in bijection,
but as orders they are distinct. For example, the ordinal ω + 1 has a nonzero element that is
not the immediate successor of any other element. Such elements are called limit ordinals and
play an important role in the theory of ordinals. Second, keep in mind that not every total order
is a well-order; the rationals are not well ordered, for example. Finally, it is tempting to guess
that the ordinals are themselves well ordered. After all, they are linearly ordered by “is an initial
segment of,” and in any set of ordinals, there is a least element. However, this leads to the Burali-
Forti paradox: were Ωthe set of all ordinals, then it’s well ordered by our above comments and
hence is (order isomorphic to) an ordinal. So Ω< Ω, contradicting trichotomy—we are forced
to conclude that the collection of all ordinals is not a set.
(i)
Use the Burali-Forti paradox to prove that there are ordinals of arbitrarily large cardinality.
(Hint: try contradiction.)
(ii)
Demonstrate the following: to prove a property P(−) holds for all ordinals, it is sufﬁcient
to demonstrate that:

74
Chapter 3
• Base Case: P(0) holds.
• Successor Step: P(α) implies P(α + 1).
• Limit Step: Given limit ordinal λ, for all α < λ such that P(α) holds, then P(λ)
holds.
(iii)
Using the following strategy, prove that the axiom of choice implies Zorn’s lemma:
Given the axiom of choice and a nonempty partially ordered set (P, ≤) in which every
chain has an upper bound, for each a ∈P deﬁne
Ea := {b ∈P | a < b}
There are two cases: if there is some a for which Ea = ∅, then a is maximal and we are
done; otherwise, the axiom of choice guarantees that there is a function f : P →P such
that fa ∈Ea for all a.
Use transﬁnite induction to prove that there are chains of all ordinal lengths in P. State a
contradiction and conclude that the axiom of choice implies Zorn’s lemma.

Categorical Limits and Colimits
A comathematician is a device for turning cotheorems into ffee.
—Unknown (Please tell us if you made this joke up!)
Introduction.
Categorical limits and colimits are one of the—and in some sense the most—
efﬁcient way to build a new mathematical object from old objects. The constructions introduced
in chapter 1—subspaces, quotients, products, and coproducts—are examples in Top, though the
discussion can occur in any category. In fact, there are a number of other important constructions—
pushouts, pullbacks, direct limits, and so on—so it’s valuable to learn the general notion.
In practice, limits are typically built by picking a subcollection according to some constraint,
whereas colimits are typically built by “gluing” objects together. More formally, the deﬁning prop-
erty of a limit is characterized by morphisms whose domain is the limit. The deﬁning property of a
colimit is characterized by morphisms whose codomain is the colimit. Because of their generality,
limits and colimits appear all across the mathematical landscape. A direct sum of abelian groups,
the least upper bound of a poset, and a CW complex are all examples of limits or colimits, and we’ll
see more examples in the pages to come. Section 4.1 opens the chapter by answering the antici-
pated question, “A (co)limit of what?” The remaining two sections contain the formal deﬁnition of
(co)limits followed by a showcase of examples.
4.1
Diagrams Are Functors
In topology, one asks for the limit of a sequence. In category theory, one asks for the
(co)limit of a diagram. In what follows, it will be helpful to view a diagram as a functor.
More speciﬁcally, a diagram in a category is a functor from the shape of the diagram to the
category. For example, a commutative diagram like this
X
Y
Z
f
g
h
in a category C is a choice of three objects X, Y, and Z and some morphisms f : X →Y,
g: X →Z, and h: Z →Y, with f = hg. It can be viewed as the image of a functor from an

76
Chapter 4
indexing category; that is, from a picture like this:
•
•
•
This is a small category—let’s call it D—containing three objects pictured as bullets and
three morphisms pictured as arrows. Though they must be in D, not shown are the identity
morphisms and compositions. Here composition is determined by setting the composition
of the two diagonal arrows to be the horizontal arrow. A functor F : D →C involves a
choice of three objects and three morphisms and must respect composition. In summary,
a diagram

is a functor


•
→C

The concept of identifying a map with its image is a familiar one. A sequence of real
numbers, for instance, is a function x: N →R, though one may write xn for xn and think
of the sequence as the collection (x1, x2, . . .). Likewise, a path in a topological space X is a
continuous function p: [0, 1] →X, though one may often have the image pI ⊂X in mind.
The idea that “a diagram is a functor” is no different.
Deﬁnition 4.1 Let D be a small category. A D-shaped diagram in a category C is a functor
D →C. If the categories C and D are understood, we’ll simply say diagram instead of D-
shaped diagram in C.
Because a diagram is a functor, it makes sense to ask for a morphism from one diagram
to another—it’s a natural transformation of functors. As we’ll see below, a (co)limit of a
diagram F involves a morphism between F and a diagram of a speciﬁc shape—a point. A
point-shaped diagram is a functor that is constant at a given object of a category. Indeed
we can view any object A of C as a D-shaped diagram for any category D and namely as
the constant functor. It is deﬁned by sending every object in D to A and every arrow in D
to the identity at A in C.
•
A
•
A
idA
A
Notice we’re using the symbol A for both the object A and for the constant functor itself.
In other words, we allow ourselves ﬂexibility in viewing A as an object or as a functor. In
this way, we introduce the phrase “a map from an object to a diagram” to mean a natural
transformation from the constant functor to the diagram.

Categorical Limits and Colimits
77
Deﬁnition 4.2 Given a functor F : D →C, a map from an object A to F—that is, an
element of Nat(A, F)—is called a cone from A to F. Similarly, a cone from F to A is an
element of Nat(F, A).
Unwinding the deﬁnition, a cone from A to F : D →C is a collection of maps
 A
η•
−→F • where • is an object in D 	
such that the diagrams:
A
F•
F◦
η•
η◦
Fϕ
commute for every morphism •
ϕ
−−→◦in D. For example, a cone from some object A to the
functor F with which we opened the section consists of three maps ηX, ηY, and ηZ ﬁtting
together in a commutative diagram:
A
X
Y
Z
ηX
ηY
f
g
h
ηZ
As we’ll see in the next section, a limit of F is a special cone over F and a colimit of F is
a special cone under F.
4.2
Limits and Colimits
Here are the formal deﬁnitions of limit and colimit.
Deﬁnition 4.3 A limit of the diagram F : D →C is a cone η from an object lim F to the
diagram satisfying the universal property that for any other cone γ from an object B to the
diagram, there is a unique morphism h: B →lim F so that γ• = η•h for all objects • in D.
B
lim F
F•
γ•
h
η•
One may understand this colloquially in the following way. First, recognize that there may
exist many cones over F—many objects with maps pointing down to the diagram. But

78
Chapter 4
only one of them can satisfy the property of limit, namely η: lim F →F. You might,
however, come across another cone γ: B →F that behaves similarly. Perhaps γ also
commutes with every arrow in the diagram F and thus seems to imitate η. But the similarity
is no coincidence. The natural transformation γ behaves like η precisely because it is
built up from η. That is, it factors through η as γ = η ◦h for some unique morphism
h. This is the universality of the limit cone. Informally, then, the limit of a diagram is
the “shallowest” cone over the diagram. One might visualize all possible cones over the
diagram as cascading down to the limit. It is the one that is as close to the diagram as
possible:
F
lim F
η
•
•
•
We can similarly ask for maps from a diagram to an object in the category. This leads to
the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4.4 A colimit of the diagram F : D →C is a cone ϵ from the diagram to an
object colim F satisfying the universal property that for any other cone γ from the diagram
to an object B, there is a unique map h: colim F →B so that γ• = hϵ• for all objects • in
D.
F•
colim F
B
γ•
ϵ•
h
Informally, a colimit of a diagram F is the “shallowest” cone under F. There many exist
many cones—many objects with maps pointing away from the diagram—under F, but a
colimit is the cone that is closest to the diagram. Again, one makes sense of the informal

Categorical Limits and Colimits
79
words “shallow” and “close” via the universal property in the deﬁnition:
F
ε
colim F
•
•
•
Be aware that the (co)limit of a diagram may not exist, but if it does, then—as the reader
should verify—it is unique up to a unique isomorphism. We will therefore refer to the
(co)limit of a diagram.
4.3
Examples
Depending on the shape of the indexing category, the (co)limit of a diagram may be given a
familiar name: intersection, union, Cartesian product, kernel, direct sum, quotient, ﬁbered
product, and so on. The following examples illustrate this idea. In each case, recall that
the data of a (co)limit is an object together with maps to or from that object, satisfying a
universal property.
4.3.1
Terminal and Initial Objects
If the indexing category D is empty—no objects and no morphisms—then a functor D →C
is an empty diagram. The limit of an empty diagram is called a terminal object. It is an
object T in C such that for every object X in C there is a unique morphism X →T. In
other words, all objects in the category terminate at T. In Set the terminal object is the
one-point set; in Top it’s the one-point space; in Grp it’s the trivial group; in FVect, it’s
the zero vector space; in a poset, its the greatest element, if it exists. This highlights an
important point: not every category has a terminal object. For example, R with the usual
ordering is a poset without a greatest element—it is a category without a terminal object.
Dually, the colimit of an empty diagram is called an initial object. It is an object I in C
such that for every object X in C there is a unique morphism I →X. In other words, all
objects in the category initialize from I. In Set the initial object is the empty set; in Top

80
Chapter 4
it’s the empty space; in Grp it’s the trivial group; in FVect, it’s the zero vector space; in a
poset, it’s the least element, if it exists. Again, not every category has an initial object.
Many times, when one is interested in the limit of a diagram, the colimit of the diagram
will be trivial, or vice versa. For example, the colimit of a diagram that has a terminal
object Y is just the object Y, together with the morphisms in the diagram. For example, the
object Y is terminal in this diagram:
Z
X
Y
h
f
g
and indeed the colimit of this diagram is just Y with the map of the diagram given by
f : X →Y, h: Z →Y, and idY : Y →Y. It has the universal property since for any object
S , a map from the diagram to S includes a map from Y to S making everything commute.
That map is the one satisﬁed by the universal property of Y being the colimit.
Z
X
Y
S
h
f
g
Similarly, the limit of a diagram with an initial object X is just the initial object X, together
with the morphisms in the diagram.
4.3.2
Products and Coproducts
If the indexing category D has no nonidentity morphisms—that is, if D is a discrete cat-
egory—then a diagram D →C is just a collection of objects parametrized by D. In this
case, the limit of the diagram is called the product and the colimit is called the coproduct.
When C = Set, you can verify the universal properties of the product and coproduct given
in chapter 0 and show that they are indeed the limit and colimit of discrete diagrams. When
the category is Top, the limit is the product of the spaces in the diagram, equipped with the
product topology, together with projection maps, down to each of the factors. Likewise, the
coproduct is the disjoint union of spaces, equipped with the coproduct topology, together
with inclusion maps from each space.
Quite often, one is only interested in a subset (or subspace) of the product. For instance,
given sets or spaces X and Y, it’s often interesting to consider only those pairs (x, y) ∈
X × Y where x and y relate to each other according to some equation. In a dual sense, one
may be interested in identifying parts of sets (or spaces) rather than considering their full

Categorical Limits and Colimits
81
coproduct. The next few categorical constructions provide different ways of accomplishing
these tasks.
4.3.3
Pullbacks and Pushouts
A functor from • −→• ←• is a diagram
X
Y
Z
f
g
and its limit is called the pullback of X and Y along the morphisms f and g. In Set the
pullback is realized by the set consisting of all pairs (x, y) satisfying f x = gy, along with
projection maps onto each factor X and Y. The set is denoted by X×Z Y. Diagrammatically,
there is a special notation to describe pullbacks. A square diagram decorated with a caret
“ ⌟” in the upper left corner denotes a pullback diagram. For example, this diagram
◦
•
•
•
⌟
should be read as saying, “the square commutes and the object ◦is the pullback.” As a
concrete example, suppose X = ∗is the one-point set so that a function f : ∗→Z picks out
an element z ∈Z. Then the pullback consists of the set of points y ∈Y such that gy = z. In
other words, the pullback is the preimage g−1z ⊂Y.
In Top, the pullback has X ×Z Y as its underlying set and it becomes a topological space
when viewed as a subspace of the product X×Y. It satisﬁes the universal property described
by this diagram:
X ×Z Y
X
Y
Z
πX
πY
⌟
f
g
Explicitly, the pullback topology (ﬁrst characterization) is the ﬁnest topology for which the
projection maps πx : X ×Z Y →X and πY : X ×Z Y →Y are continuous. Alternatively, the
pullback topology (second characterization) is determined by specifying that maps into the
pullback from any space W are continuous if and only if the maps W →X and W →Y
obtained by postcomposing with f and g are continuous. Said the other way around: maps
to the pullback from a space W are speciﬁed by maps a: W →X and b: W →Y with
fa = gb.
At some point you might encounter a statement such as “the map p: Y →X is the
pullback of π: E →B along the map f : X →B.” This means that p ﬁts into a pullback

82
Chapter 4

Y
E

p
⌟
π
f
and that Y together with p: Y →X and the unnamed map is the pullback of the rest of
the diagram. The unnamed map Y →E exists and is part of the pullback but might not be
explicitly mentioned.
Dually, a functor from • ←• →• is a diagram,
Z
X
Y
g
f
and its colimit is called the pushout of X and Y along the morphisms f and g. In Set the
pushout of maps f : Z →X and g: Z →Y is realized by the quotient set X⊔ZY := X ` Y/∼
where ∼is the equivalence relation generated by fz ∼gz for all z ∈Z, together with maps
from X and Y into the quotient. By analogy with pullbacks, we will use a caret to denote a
pushout square. That is, a diagram such as
•
•
•
◦
⌜
means that the square commutes and that ◦is the pushout. As a concrete example of a
pushout in Set, note that given any two sets A and B, the intersection A ∩B is a subset of
A and B. So we have the diagram of inclusions
A ∩B
A
B
The pushout of this diagram is the union A ∪B. Said explicitly, the union ﬁts into the
diagram, and for any other set S that ﬁts into the diagram, there’s a unique function from
A ∪B →S as pictured by the dashed line below:
A ∩B
A
B
A ∪B
S
⌜

Categorical Limits and Colimits
83
The universal property of the pushout in this example says that a function A ∪B →S is
the same as a pair of functions A →S and B →S that agree on A ∩B.
In Top, the pullback has the quotient X⊔ZY as its underlying set. It becomes a topological
space as a quotient space of the coproduct. This pushout satisﬁes the universal property
described by this diagram; that is, by making use of the caret notation for pushouts:
Z
X
Y
X ⊔Z Y
f
g
iX
iY
⌜
The pushout topology (ﬁrst characterization) is the coarsest topology for which the maps
iX : X →X ⊔Z Y and iY : Y →X ⊔Z Y, which send an element to its equivalence class, are
continuous. Alternatively, the pushout topology (second characterization) is determined
by specifying that maps from the pushout to any space W are continuous if and only if the
maps X →W and Y →W obtained by precomposing with f and g are continuous. Said the
other way around: maps from the pushout to a space W are speciﬁed by maps a: X →W
and b: Y →W with a f = bg.
Pushout diagrams like this are commonly used to describe the space obtained by attach-
ing a disc Dn to a space X along a map f : S n−1 →X.
S n−1
X
Dn
X ⊔S n−1 Dn
f
i
iX
iY
⌜
In this case, the map S n−1 ,→Dn is usually understood as the inclusion, and one describes
the pushout succinctly by saying “the disc Dn is attached to X via the attaching map f” and
writes X ⊔f Dn. Some authors (Brown, 2006) call these pushouts “adjunction spaces,” but
we will not. We reserve “adjunction” for another purpose (see chapter 5).
To summarize, pullbacks provide one way to obtain a limit from the product while
pushouts provide one way to obtain a quotient of the coproduct. If we change the shape
of the indexing categories, then the (co)limit of the resulting diagrams provide additional
constructions: inverse and directed limits.
4.3.4
Inverse and Direct Limits
The limit of a diagram of the shape • ←• ←• ←· · · , such as
X1
f1←X2
f2←X3 ←· · ·
is sometimes called the inverse limit of the objects {Xi}. As in the case of pullbacks, the
inverse limit in Set is a certain subset of the product of the objects. Explicitly, the inverse
limit is realized by the set of sequences (x1, x2, . . .) ∈Q
i Xi satisfying fixi+1 = xi for all i,

84
Chapter 4
together with projection maps from the product down to each factor. It is denoted by lim
←−−Xi
and can be thought of as the smallest object that projects down to the factors. The inverse
limit in Top has this set of sequences as its underlying set. It becomes a topological space
when endowed with the subspace topology of the product. For example, the limit of the
diagram of spaces
R ←R2 ←R3 ←· · ·
where the maps Rn+1 →Rn are given by (x1, . . . , xn, xn+1) 7→(x1, . . . , xn) is the product
X = Q
n∈N R, the set of all sequences (x1, x2, x3, . . .) with the product topology. The projec-
tions X →Rn deﬁned by (x1, x2, . . .) 7→(x1, . . . , xn) deﬁne the map from X to the diagram,
and the topology on X is the coarsest topology making the maps from X to the diagram
continuous. Here, the limit X of the diagram R ←R2 ←R3 · · · agrees in both Top and
Vectk.
Dually, the colimit of a diagram of the shape • →• →• →· · · , such as
X1 →X2 →X3 →· · ·
is sometimes called the directed limit of the {Xi}. It is denoted by lim
−−→Xi and consists of
an object X, together with maps ik : Xk →X that assemble to be a map from the diagram.
In a concrete category in which the objects are sets with some additional structure and
the Xk →Xk+1 are injections, one can think of the diagram as an increasing sequence of
objects. The colimit, if it exists, may be thought of as the union of the objects.
As a closing remark, notice that the limit of the diagram X1 →X2 →X3 →· · · or the
colimit of the diagram X1 ←X2 ←X3 ←· · · are both just the object X1.
Example 4.1 In linear algebra, the colimit of N copies of R is the set of sequences of real
numbers for which all but ﬁnitely many are zero and is denoted ⊕n∈NR. This is not the
same as the colimit of N copies of R in Top, which is `
n∈N R. To make the vector space
⊕n∈NR into a topological space, we need to view it in a different way.
Speciﬁcally, X = ⊕n∈NR is the colimit of the diagram of (vector and topological) spaces
R →R2 →R3 →· · ·
where the map Rn →Rn+1 is given by (x1, . . . , xn) 7→(x1, . . . , xn, 0). Think of the diagram
as an increasing union: R sits inside R2 as the x axis, then R2 sits inside R3 as the xy-plane,
and so on. The colimit X of the diagram is an inﬁnite dimensional space in which all these
ﬁnite dimensional spaces sit inside and is the smallest such space, meaning that if Y is any
other space that has maps Xi →Y, these maps factor through a map X →Y. The space X is
realized as the set of sequences (x1, x2, . . .) for which all but ﬁnitely many xi are nonzero,
together with the maps Rn →X deﬁned by
(x1, . . . , xn) 7→(x1, . . . , xn, 0, 0, . . .)

Categorical Limits and Colimits
85
which identify the Rns with increasing subsets of X. The vector space structure is addition
and scalar multiplication of sequences. The topology on X coming from the colimit can
be described explicitly by saying that a set U of sequences is open if and only if the inter-
section U ∩Rn is open for all n ∈N. This is the ﬁnest topology that makes the inclusions
Rn ,→X continuous.
4.3.5
Equalizers and Coequalizers
The limit of a diagram of the shape •
• , such as
X
Y
f
g
is called the equalizer of f and g. In Set the equalizer is realized as the set E = {x ∈
X | f x = gx}, together with the inclusion map E →X. It’s the largest subset of the domain
X on which the two maps agree. In Top, the equalizer has E as its underlying set and
becomes a space when endowed with the subspace topology. The universal property is
captured in this diagram:
S
E
X
Y
f
g
In algebraic categories, such as Grp, Vectk, RMod, the equalizer of f : G →H and the
unique map from the initial object 0: G →H is called the kernel of f.
Dually, the colimit of the same diagram
X
Y
f
g
is called the coequalizer of f and g. In Set and Top, the coequalizer is realized as the
quotient Y/∼where ∼is the equivalence relation generated by f x ∼gx for each x ∈X,
endowed with the quotient topology in the case of Top. It’s the quotient of the codomain Y
by the smallest relation that makes the maps agree. The universal property is captured in
this diagram:
X
Y
C
S
f
g
In algebraic categories, such as Grp, Vectk, RMod, the coequalizer of f : G →H and the
unique map from the initial object 0: G →H is the called the cokernel of f.
After reading through the examples in this chapter, you might suspect that a limit is
always, in some sense, either a product or a construction obtained from a product. This
suspicion is indeed correct and provides a prescription for constructing limits in general. In
fact, it is a theorem: if a category has all products and all equalizers, then it has all limits.
Likewise, the feeling that a colimit may be regarded as either a coproduct or a quotient of

86
Chapter 4
a coproduct is also a theorem: if a category has all coproducts and all coequalizers, then it
has all colimits. We’ll close with these results in the next section.
4.4
Completeness and Cocompleteness
A category is called complete if it contains the limits of small diagrams and is called co-
complete if it contains the colimits of all small diagrams.1 The categories Set and Top are
both complete and cocomplete. In Set, one can construct the colimit of any diagram by
taking the disjoint union of every set in the diagram and then quotienting by the relations
required for the diagram to map into the resulting set. In Top, this set gets the quotient
topology of the disjoint union. This topology is the ﬁnest topology for which all the maps
involved in the map from the diagram are continuous.
Dually, to construct the limit of any diagram of sets, ﬁrst take the product of all the sets
that appear in the diagram. The product then maps to all objects in the diagram. The limit
of the diagram is simply the subset of the product so that the projection maps to the objects
assemble to be a map to the diagram. In Top, this set gets the subspace topology of the
product. This topology is the coarsest topology for which all the maps involved in the map
to the diagram are continuous.
Seeing how to deﬁne an arbitrary colimit of sets as a quotient of the disjoint union or
how to deﬁne an arbitrary limit as a subspace of the product gives the idea of how to prove
the following theorem: small (co)limits are all “generated by” a set’s worth of (co)products
and (co)equalizers.
Theorem 4.1 If a category has products and equalizers, then it is complete. If it has
coproducts and coequalizers, then it is cocomplete.
Proof. Here’s how to construct the colimit of a diagram in a category with coproducts and
coequalizers. Proceed in two steps. First, take the coproduct Y of all the objects Xα in the
diagram that have morphisms Xα →Xβ from them (there may be multiple copies of Xαs)
and take the coproduct Z of all the objects Xβ that appear in the diagram (just one copy
each):
Y :=
a
Xα→Xβ
Xα
Z :=
a
β
Xβ
There are two maps Y →Z. One map, call it f, is deﬁned by taking the coproduct of the
morphisms in the diagram, and one map is deﬁned simply by identities. The coequalizer
of these two maps
Y
Z
f
id

is the colimit of the diagram. The idea for limits is similar.
A summary of the ideas discussed in this chapter can be organized as seen in table 4.1.
We end this chapter with a deﬁnition and an example.

Deﬁnition 4.5 A functor is continuous if and only if it takes limits to limits. It is cocon-
tinuous if it takes colimits to colimits.
Example 4.2 Given a object X in a category C, the hom functor C(X, −): C →Set is
continuous. One may wish for a dual statement, “C(−, X): Cop →Set is cocontinuous,”
but this is not the case. The contravariance of C(−, X) does imply that colimits are sent to
limits. In fact, we’ve seen a special case of these results in the discussion of the universal
property of products and coproducts in Set in section 0.3.4. An example of a cocontinuous
functor may be found in exercise 4.5 at the end of the chapter.

Adjunctions and the Compact-Open Topology
Birds ﬂy high in the air and survey broad vistas of mathematics out to the far horizon. They delight
in concepts that unify our thinking and bring together diverse problems from different parts of the
landscape. Frogs live in the mud below and see only the ﬂowers that grow nearby. They delight in
the details of particular objects, and they solve problems one at a time.
—Freeman Dyson (2009)
Introduction.
Early in chapter 0 it was noted that category theory is an appropriate setting in
which to discuss the concept of “sameness” between mathematical objects. This concept is captured
by an isomorphism: a morphism from one object to another that is both left and right invertible.
The discussion becomes especially interesting when those objects are categories. Two categories are
isomorphic if there exists a pair of functors—one in each direction—whose compositions equal the
identities. But equality is a lot of ask for! Isomorphisms of categories are too strict to be of much
use. Relaxing the situation yields something better: categories C and D are equivalent if there exists
a pair of functors L: C
D: R and natural isomorphisms idC →RL and LR →idD.
Relaxing this a step further yields another gem of category theory: adjunctions. A pair of functors
L: C
D: R forms an adjunction, and L and R are called adjoint functors, if there are natural
transformations (not necessarily isomorphisms) η: idC →RL and ϵ : LR →idD that, in addition,
interact compatibly in a sense that can be made precise. Here the categories may not be equivalent,
but don’t think that adjunctions are mere second (or third) best. Quite often, relaxing a notion of
equivalence results in a trove of rich mathematics. That is indeed the case here.
In this chapter, then, we introduce adjoint functors and use them to highlight several construc-
tions in topology. We’ll present the formal deﬁnition in section 5.1 and give some examples—free
constructions in algebra, a forgetful functor from Top, and the Stone- ˇCech compactiﬁcation—in sec-
tions 5.2, 5.3, and 5.5, respectively. Then we’ll use a particularly nice adjunction—the product-hom
adjunction—as motivation for putting an appropriate topology on function spaces. In section 5.6,
we’ll take an in-depth look at this topology, called the compact-open topology. Quite a few pages
are devoted to this endeavor and some of the difﬁculties involved. Finally, section 5.7 closes with
a discussion on the category of compactly generated weakly Hausdorff spaces—a “convenient” cat-
egory of topological spaces. So in the pages to come, we’ll be both birds and frogs. A categorical
point of view oftentimes highlights and elevates the important properties that characterize an object
or construction but fails to establish that such objects exist. Existence can require getting down in
the mud.

Chapter 5
5.1
Adjunctions
As mentioned above, an adjunction consists of a pair of functors L and R and a pair of
natural transformations η and ϵ that interact in a certain way. But there is an equivalent
deﬁnition, which is simpler to digest in a ﬁrst introduction. We’ll present this deﬁnition
now and jump right into an example. The alternate deﬁnition will be given shortly after.
Deﬁnition 5.1 Let C and D be categories. An adjunction between C and D is a pair of
functors L: C →D and R: D →C together with an isomorphism
D(LX, Y)

←→C(X, RY)
(5.1)
for each object X in C and each object Y in D that is natural in both components. The
functor L is called the left adjoint and the functor R is called the right adjoint. We say the
adjunction isomorphism—applied in either direction—sends a morphism to its adjunct (or
transpose) and we write ˆf for the adjunct of a map f. Together, all of this information is
often denoted by
L: C
D: R
or even more succinctly by L ⊣R.
To say that the isomorphism in (5.1) is “natural” in both components means that it arises
via natural transformations. More precisely, notice that for each object X in C we get a pair
of hom-functors
D(LX, −)
C(X, R−)
from D →Set. Similarly, for each object Y in D we have the hom-functors
D(L−, Y)
C(−, RY)
from Cop →Set. Saying the isomorphism C(LX, Y)
−→D(X, RY) is “natural in both
components” means that there are natural transformations of functors
D(LX, −)
C(X, R−)
D(L−, Y)
C(−, RY)


Example 5.1 For any sets X, Y, and Z, the bijection YX×Z

−−→

YXZ arises from an ad-
junction. The functor X×−: Set →Set is left adjoint to the functor Set(X, −): Set →Set.
To see it clearly, ﬁx a set X, and deﬁne two functors
L := X × −: Set →Set
R := Set(X, −): Set →Set
Then
Set(LZ, Y) = YX×Z 

YXZ = Set(Z, RY)

Adjunctions and the Compact-Open Topology

The setup L: Set
Set: R is called the product-hom adjunction. It will make several
appearances in the pages to come. The “hom” in “product-hom” refers to “homomor-
phisms,” which is how people used to, and sometimes still do, refer to “morphisms” in
categories. We didn’t want to try out a new name, like “product-mor,” for this adjunction,
however.
5.1.1
The Unit and Counit of an Adjunction
Suppose L: C
D: R is an adjunction with adjunction isomorphism
ϕX,Y : D(LX, Y)

−−→C(X, RY)
(5.2)
By setting Y = LX, we have an isomorphism
ϕX,LX : D(LX, LX)

−−→C(X, RLX)
Under this isomorphism, the morphism idLX in the category D corresponds to a morphism
ηX := ϕX,LX(idLX): X →RLX in the category C. As one can check, these maps assemble
into a natural transformation
η: idC →RL
called the unit of the adjunction. In other words, the unit is comprised of the adjuncts of
the identity maps: ηX := d
idLX. Similarly for X = RY, under the isomorphism
ϕRY,Y : D(LRY, Y)

−−→C(RY, RY)
the morphism idRY in C corresponds to a morphism ϵY := d
idRY : LRY →Y that deﬁnes a
natural transformation
ϵ : LR →idD
called the counit of the adjunction.
Understanding the counit and unit of an adjunction helps to understand the isomor-
phisms (5.2) and their corresponding universal properties. For example, suppose X ∈C.
For any Y ∈D and f : X →RY, there exists a unique g: RLX →RY so that gηX = f.
Here’s the picture.
RLX
X
RY
g
ηX
f
Indeed, we can explicitly identify g as R ˆf. The equality gηX = f follows from the naturality
of the adjunction isomorphism ϕ: D(LX, −) →C(X, R−).

94
Chapter 5
Explicitly, ﬁx X and Y, and let f ∈C(X, RY). Then we have the adjunct map ˆf ∈
D(LX, Y) where ϕ ˆf = f. Moreover, this square commutes:
D(LX, LX)
C(X, RLX)
D(LX, Y)
C(X, RY)
ϕ
ˆf∗
(R ˆf)∗
ϕ
Choosing idLX ∈D(LX, LX) and noting that ϕ idLX = ηX, commutativity implies ϕ ˆf = R ˆfη,
that is f = gη with g = R ˆf.
Example 5.2 Let’s look at the unit and counit of the product-hom adjunction L: Set
Set: R
in Set where
L = X × −: Set →Set
and
R = Set(X, −): Set →Set
The counit of this adjunction is the evaluation map eval: X×YX →Y deﬁned by eval(x, f) =
f(x). The unit is the map Z →(X × Z)X deﬁned by z 7→(−, z), where (−, z): X →X × Z is
the function x 7→(x, z).
The natural transformations η and ϵ provide another way to deﬁne an adjunction.
Deﬁnition 5.2 An adjunction between categories C and D is a pair of functors L: C →D
and R: D →C together with natural transformations η: idC →RL and ϵ : LR →idD such
that for all objects X ∈C and Y ∈D the following triangles commute:
LX
LRLX
RY
RLRY
LX
RY
LηX
idLX
ϵLX
ηRY
idRY
RϵY
Verifying the equivalence of deﬁnitions 5.1 and 5.2 is a good exercise.
The next few sections contain additional examples of adjunctions. The ﬁrst example
arises in an algebraic context, while the remaining examples come from topology.
5.2
Free-Forgetful Adjunction in Algebra
Often, free constructions in algebra (free modules, free groups, free abelian groups, free
monoids, etc.) are deﬁned by universal properties. To be concrete, let’s consider free
groups, since modifying the discussion for other free constructions is usually easy. Here’s
the way a free group is commonly deﬁned:
A free group on a set S is a group FS together with a map of sets η: S →FS satisfying
the property that for any group G and any map of sets f : S →G there exists a unique
group homomorphism ˆf : FS →G so that ˆfη = f.

Adjunctions and the Compact-Open Topology
95
This diagram can help:
FS
S
G
ˆf
η
f
and yet, the diagram is also confusing. After all, some objects in the diagrams are sets,
some are groups, some of the arrows are set maps, and some are group homomorphisms.
The situation becomes clearer when one observes that there is a forgetful functor U from
groups to sets.
Grp
Set
G
UG
G′
UG′
U
ϕ
Uϕ:=ϕ
It assigns to any group its underlying set (which explains the letter “U”) and to any group
homomorphism its underlying function. The adjective forgetful is often applied to a functor
that “forgets” some or all of the structure of the objects in its codomain. It is a loose term
that can be applied to lots of functors whose main job is to drop some data.
One may then deﬁne a free group on a set S to be a group FS and a map η: S →UFS
with the property that, for all groups G and maps f : S →UG, there exists a unique map
ˆf : FS →G so that f = U ˆfη. So the right picture is in Set:
UFS
S
UG
U ˆf
η
f
Notice that the “there exists” part of the deﬁnition of a free group says that for every group
G, the map Grp(FS,G) →Set(S, UG) is surjective. The “unique” part of the deﬁnition
says that Grp(FS,G) →Set(S, UG) is injective. The upshot is that “free” and “forgetful”
form an adjoint pair F : Set
Grp: U, providing the isomorphism,
Set(S, UG)

Grp(FS,G)
The unit of this adjunction deﬁnes the inclusion η: S →UFS .
Remark 5.1 The universal property deﬁning a free group can also be understood within
the context of set maps S →UG for all groups G. So, one could make a category out
of this context. Let’s call this category US. An object in US is a group G and a set map
f : S →UG. A morphism between two objects S
f−→UG and S
f ′
−→UG′ is a group

96
Chapter 5
homomorphism ϕ: G →G′ so that Uϕf = f ′. That is,
S
UG
UG′
f
f ′
Uϕ
Then,
a free group on a set S is an initial object in the category US.
The context for the universal property is put into a category US that is built out of the
undisguised material involved: the set S and the functor U : Grp →Set. Then the univer-
sal object is a familiar notion (an initial object) from category theory.
The algebraic discussion here arose from considering a forgetful functor. One also has a
forgetful functor in the topological setting, which gives rise to further adjunctions.
5.3
The Forgetful Functor U: Top →Set and Its Adjoints
There is a forgetful functor U : Top →Set that assigns to any topological space (X, TX)
the set X and to any continuous function f : (X, TX) →(Y, TY) the function f : X →Y.
It is both a left and right adjoint in Top. Deﬁne a functor D: Set →Top that assigns to
any set X the space (X, Tdiscrete) with the discrete topology. To any function f : X →Y, let
D f = f, which is a continuous function. The setup D: Set
Top: U is an adjunction;
for any set X and any space Y, we have
Top(DX, Y)

Set(X, UY)
On the right, we have arbitrary functions from the set X into the space Y, viewed as a set.
On the left, we take continuous functions DX →Y, which are all functions from X →Y,
since every function from a discrete space is continuous.
But here’s another functor I : Set →Top that assigns to a set the same set with the
indiscrete topology and to any function f : X →Y, the same function, which will be
continuous. Then U : Top
Set: I is an adjunction; for any space X and any set Y, we
have
Set(UX, Y)

Top(X, IY)
On the left we have arbitrary functions from X, viewed as a set, to the set Y. On the right,
we have continuous functions X →IY, which are all functions X →Y since every function
into an indiscrete space is continuous.
The universal properties arising from these adjunctions don’t seem very interesting, but
the fact that U is both a left and a right adjoint has important consequences. Notice this
theorem in particular.

Adjunctions and the Compact-Open Topology
97
Theorem 5.1 If L: C →D has a right adjoint, then L is cocontinuous. If R: D →C has a
left adjoint, then R is continuous.
Proof. Recall from exercise 4.8 at the end of chapter 4 that there is a natural isomorphism:
C(colim F, Y)

lim C(F(−), Y)
for any functor F : B →C. Therefore,
D(L(colim F), Y)

C(colim F, RY)

lim C(F−, RY)

lim D(LF−, Y)

D(colim LF, Y)
Therefore, L(colim F) satisﬁes the universal property of colim LF. And in particular,
because colimits (if they exist) are unique up to unique isomorphism,
L(colim F)

colim LF
Thus, L is cocontinuous.
By a similar argument—which we encourage the reader to
verify—right adjoint functors are continuous.
Corollary 5.1.1 Right adjoints preserve products.
Proof. Immediate. Products are limits.
This explains why the constructions of products and coproducts, subspaces and quotients,
equalizers and coequalizers, and pullbacks and pushforwards in Top must have, as an un-
derlying set, the corresponding construction in Set: if the construction exists in Top then
the forgetful functor U : Top →Set preserves it!
5.4
Adjoint Functor Theorems
What about a converse to theorem 5.1? Let R : D →C be any functor. Under what
conditions will R have a left adjoint? Clearly, R must be continuous. Is the continuity of R
sufﬁcient? Not quite. Here’s a nice way to think about it. For each object X ∈C, look at the
category RX whose objects consist of an object Y in D together with a morphism X →RY.
A morphism between f : X →RY and f ′ : X →RY′ is a morphism g: Y →Y′ such that
(Rg)f = f ′. As in remark 5.1, given a functor L: C →D, an object LX ∈D satisfying
D(LX, Y)  C(X, RY) for all Y is an initial object in RX. If there is an initial object LX
in RX for every object X, then they assemble functorially into a left adjoint L: C →D.
In any category, an initial object is the limit of the identity functor. So, R will have a left
adjoint if and only if the identity functor on the category RX has a limit for all objects
X. If the category D is complete, then the functor R being continuous implies that RX is

98
Chapter 5
complete. However, even if RX is complete, the identity functor on RX is usually not a
small diagram. So, there are a suite of theorems known as adjoint functor theorems that
assume the functor R is continuous and the category D is complete and that add some kind
of hypothesis allowing one to use the fact that RX has limits of all small diagrams to prove
that the identity functor on RX has a limit. We don’t use any adjoint functor theorems in
this book, but it’s good to know they exist. Let’s state one precisely with the Solution Set
Condition (Mac Lane, 2013; Freyd, 1969) hypothesis.
The Solution Set Condition
A functor R: D →C satisﬁes the Solution Set Condition
if and only if for every object X in C, there exists a set of objects {Yi} in D and a set of
morphisms
S = {fi : X →RYi}
so that any f : X →RY factors through some fi ∈S along a morphism Yi →Y in D.
The Adjoint Functor Theorem
Suppose D is complete and that R: D →C is a continu-
ous functor satisfying the Solution Set Condition. Then R has a left adjoint L: C →D.
For details beyond what we’ve already said, see the classic reference by Mac Lane (2013)
or section 4.6 of the excellent book by Riehl (2016), and for an enlightening treatment of
adjunctions including applications, see Spivak (2014). Before moving on, we should say
that there are adjoint functor theorems for the existence of right adjoints as well. They
suppose that L: C →D is a cocontinuous functor from a cocomplete category C, with
some “co” version of the Solution Set Condition.
Our discussion of adjoint functor theorems arose from an observation about the forget-
ful functor on Top and its adjoints. Another notable adjunction in topology arises in a
discussion on compactiﬁcations.
5.5
Compactiﬁcations
Deﬁnition 5.3 A compactiﬁcation of a topological space is an embedding of the space as
a dense subspace of a compact Hausdorff space.
So a compactiﬁcation of X is a compact Hausdorff space Y and a continuous injection
i: X →Y with X  iX ⊆Y and X = Y. Note that only Hausdorff spaces have compactiﬁ-
cations since every subspace of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff.
Example 5.3 The inclusion (0, 1) ,→[0, 1] and the map (0, 1) ,→S 1 deﬁned by t 7→
(cos 2πt, sin 2πt) are both compactiﬁcations. For the space X = (0, 1) with the discrete
topology, the map X ,→[0, 1] is not an embedding and is hence not a compactiﬁcation.
5.5.1
The One-Point Compactiﬁcation
If a compactiﬁcation Y of a space X is obtained by adding a single point to X, then X ,→Y
is called a one-point compactiﬁcation—also sometimes called the Alexandroff one-point

Adjunctions and the Compact-Open Topology
99
compactiﬁcation. A space X has one-point compactiﬁcation if and only if X is Hausdorff
and locally compact. If a space has a one-point compactiﬁcation, then it’s unique.
To see this, suppose X ,→X∗is a compactiﬁcation and X∗∖X = {p}. The open neighbor-
hoods of p are precisely the complements of compact subsets of X: the complement of an
open set containing p is a closed subset of a compact space and so is compact. Conversely
if K is a compact subset of X ⊂X∗, then it is closed, so its complement in X∗is an open
set containing p. Then, because points of X can be separated by open sets from the point
p ∈X∗∖X, there’s a neighborhood of every point of X contained in a compact set, so X is
locally compact. The fact that X is a dense subset of X∗implies {p} is not open, meaning
that X is not already compact.
Conversely, beginning with any space X, one constructs a new space by adding a point p
and deﬁning the open neighborhoods of p to be complements of compact sets in X. If X is
locally compact and Hausdorff and not compact, the result is a topology on X∗:= X ∪{p}
that is compact and Hausdorff having X as a dense subset.
Now, what kind of property does the one-point compactiﬁcation have?
Theorem 5.2 Suppose X is locally compact, Hausdorff, and not compact, and let i: X →
X∗be the one-point compactiﬁcation of X. If e: X →Y is any other compactiﬁcation of
X, then there exists a unique quotient map q: Y →X∗with qe = i.
Y
X
X∗
q
i
e
Proof. The idea is that the quotient of Y obtained by identifying Y ∖eX to one point is
homeomorphic to X∗. The details are left as an exercise.
This theorem can be useful, but it really doesn’t say much more than “the one-point com-
pactiﬁcation of X is the smallest compactiﬁcation of X,” which you may ﬁnd unsurprising.
At the other extreme is the Stone- ˇCech compactiﬁcation, which has good categorical prop-
erties.
5.5.2
The Stone- ˇCech Compactiﬁcation
Let CH be the category whose objects are compact Hausdorff spaces and whose morphisms
are continuous functions. There is a functor U : CH →Top, which is just the inclusion of
compact Hausdorff spaces as a subcategory of topological spaces and is the identity on
objects and morphisms. The functor U has a left adjoint β: Top →CH called the Stone-
ˇCech compactiﬁcation. Constructions of β are outlined as construction 6.11 in May (2000)
and in more detail in section 38 of Munkres (2000).
For now, let’s just unwind this functorial description and see what it means. To say that β
is a left adjoint of U means that for every topological space X and every compact Hausdorff

100
Chapter 5
space Y, we have a natural bijection
CH(βX, Y)  Top(X, UY) = Top(X, Y)
This says continuous functions f : X →Y from a space X to a compact Hausdorff space
Y correspond precisely to continuous functions ˆf : βX →Y. Specifying the continuous
functions from βX determines the space βX if it exists, but it doesn’t prove it exists. For
that, you need a construction as outlined in the references above, or you could invoke some
version of the Adjoint Functor Theorem to prove that U : CH →Top has a left adjoint
(Mac Lane, 2013).
The unit of the Stone- ˇCech compactiﬁcation adjunction
β: Top
CH: U
deﬁnes a morphism η: X →UβX. Since UβX = βX, the Stone- ˇCech compactiﬁcation as
a left adjoint of U doesn’t just produce a compact Hausdorff space βX from any topolog-
ical space X; it also produces a continuous function η: X →βX involved in a universal
property. For every map f : X →Y between X and a compact Hausdorff space Y, there is
a unique map U ˆf = ˆf : βX →Y, the adjunct of f, so that ˆfη = f. Pictorally,
βX
X
Y
ˆf
η
f
In the case when X is locally compact and Hausdorff, the map η: X →βX is a compact-
iﬁcation of X. That is, η: X →βX is an embedding and X = βX. Then for any compact
Hausdorff space Y, the map ˆf : βX →Y is the extension of the map f : X →Y.
You might have noticed that the triangle above has the same ﬂavor as the triangle deﬁn-
ing free groups discussed earlier. This is no coincidence. In addition to the constructions
already cited, one can use ultraﬁlters to construct the Stone- ˇCech compactiﬁcation. For
any space X, there is a natural topology on the set βX of ultraﬁlters on a X. The space
βX with this topology is compact and Hausdorff, and the inclusion ηX : X →βX deﬁned
by sending a point to its principal ultraﬁlter is a realization of the Stone- ˇCech compacti-
ﬁcation. The fact that there exists an algebraic structure called a monad on the ultraﬁlter
functor β sheds further light on resemblance between the Stone- ˇCech compactiﬁcation and
the free-forgetful adjunctions in algebraic categories mentioned earlier in this chapter. For
details, we refer interested readers to the compactum article at the nLab (Stacey et al.,
2019) as well as E. Manes’s original paper (1969).
In closing, note that unlike the Stone- ˇCech compactiﬁcation, the one-point compactiﬁca-
tion X∗of a locally compact Hausdorff space X is easy to deﬁne, but it doesn’t have good

Adjunctions and the Compact-Open Topology

properties with respect to morphisms. It deﬁnitely doesn’t satisfy the condition that
CH(X∗, Y)  Top(X, Y)
For a simple example, consider X = (0, 1) and its one point compactiﬁcation i: (0, 1) →
S 1. Let Y = [0, 1] and consider the inclusion f : (0, 1) →[0, 1]. It cannot be extended to a
continuous function from S 1 →[0, 1]; there is no diagonal map that ﬁts into the diagram

In the next section, we’ll continue the discussion of adjunctions in topology. So far,
we’ve discussed free constructions in algebra, the forgetful functor in Top and its adjoints,
and compactiﬁcations. All of these are are united by the language of adjunctions. Next, we
turn to the topic of mapping spaces. For any topological spaces X and Y, there is a set of
continuous maps Top(X, Y) between them. Can that set be viewed as a space itself? That
is, for any X, Y ∈Top, can Top(X, Y) also be regarded as an object in Top in a useful way?
We’ll see that ﬁnding a suitable topology for Top(X, Y) is more subtle than, say, ﬁnding a
vector space structure on the set Vectk(V, W) of linear maps between vector spaces V and
W. In chapter 1, universal properties in Set guided us as we constructed new spaces from
old. We will also have categorical guidance on the journey to deﬁne topologies on mapping
spaces. The guide this time is the product-hom adjunction in Set.
5.6
The Exponential Topology
Let X and Y be spaces. Consider the general problem of equipping the set of continuous
functions Top(X, Y) with a topology making it a space of maps, or a mapping space. For
the record, the product topology is usually not an appropriate topology for Top(X, Y) since
it treats the space X only as an index set—it doesn’t use the topology of X except to identify
the continuous functions within the set of all functions X →Y. But what properties should
a topology on Top(X, Y) have? We take as guidance the following desired property.
Desired Property
For a ﬁxed space X, the functors
X × −: Top →Top
and
Top(X, −): Top →Top
should form an adjoint pair. That is, for all spaces Y and Z, we should have an isomorphism
of sets Top(X × Z, Y)  Top(Z, Top(X, Y)).
Let’s begin to analyze this property. First think of three ﬁxed spaces X, Y, and Z. One can
obtain a function X →Y by starting with a function g: X × Z →Y of two variables and
by ﬁxing one of the variables z ∈Z, resulting in g(−, z): X →Y. We’d like a topology on

102
Chapter 5
Top(X, Y) to have the property that, if the function g of two variables is continuous, then
the assignment z 7→g(−, z) will deﬁne a continuous map Z →Top(X, Y). Going the other
way, if we have a continuous map Z →Top(X, Y), then we should be able to assemble the
family of continuous maps from X to Y that are continuously parametrized by the space Z
into a single continuous map X × Z →Y of two variables.
Now, let’s look more closely at the desired property. Let g: X × Z →Y be continuous.
Denote the adjunct by ˆg: Z →Top(X, Y). For ˆg to be continuous, the topology on Top(X, Y)
should be rather coarse. However, if the topology on Top(X, Y) is too coarse (think of
the indiscrete topology), then the set Top(Z, Top(X, Y)) will contain too many continuous
functions—it will contain functions that are not the adjunct of any continuous map g: X ×
Z →Y. It’s a balancing act that turns out neatly; if there exists a topology on Top(X, Y) so
that for any space Z, the correspondence g 7→ˆg deﬁnes a bijection of sets
Top(X × Z, Y)  Top(Z, Top(X, Y))
then that topology is unique (Arens and Dugundji, 1951; Escard´o and Heckmann, 2002).
Let’s call it the exponential topology on Top(X, Y).
This balancing act is reminiscent of the constructions of new spaces from old in chapter
1. That’s what we’re doing here as well: given two spaces X and Y, we want to make a
new topological space from the set of continuous maps from X to Y. In chapter 1, we had
guidance from universal properties characterizing similar constructions in Set. Here, the
product-hom adjunction in Set provides our categorical guidance. Let’s go through some
of the details.
Let’s call a topology on Top(X, Y) splitting if the continuity of g: Z × X →Y implies
the continuity of ˆg: Z →Top(X, Y). Let’s call a topology on Top(X, Y) conjoining if the
continuity of ˆg: Z →Top(X, Y) implies the continuity of g: Z × X →Y. Then, to repeat
the previous remarks using this terminology (Render, 1993), a topology on Top(X, Y) must
be rather coarse to be splitting and must be rather ﬁne to be conjoining. A topology on
Top(X, Y) is exponential if and only if it is both splitting and conjoining.
Now keep in mind two things. First, the evaluation map is the counit of the product-hom
adjunction in Set. Second, the adjunct of the evaluation map is the identity. Together, these
give a very nice characterization of conjoining topologies.
Lemma 5.1 A topology on Top(X, Y) is conjoining if and only if the evaluation map
eval: X × Top(X, Y) →Y is continuous.
Proof. Assume we have a topology on Top(X, Y) for which the evaluation map is contin-
uous. Consider a continuous map ˆg: Z →Top(X, Y), and look at the following diagram
X × Z
X × Top(X, Y)
Y
id ×ˆg
eval

Adjunctions and the Compact-Open Topology
103
The identity is continuous, ˆg is continuous, and eval is continuous, so the composition
eval(id ×ˆg) is continuous. The composition is precisely g, proving that the topology on
Top(X, Y) is conjoining
For the other direction, assume we have a conjoining topology on Top(X, Y). Since the
adjunct of the evaluation map d
eval: Top(X, Y) →Top(X, Y) is the identity, which is always
continuous, we conclude that the evaluation map is continuous.
Lemma 5.2 Every splitting topology on Top(X, Y) is coarser than every conjoining topol-
ogy.
Proof. Let T , T ′ be topologies on Top(X, Y). If T ′ is conjoining, then the evaluation map
X × (Top(X, Y), T ′) →Y is continuous. If in addition T is splitting, then the adjunct of the
evaluation map X × (Top(X, Y), T ′) →Y is continuous. Since the adjunct of the evaluation
map is the identity (Top(X, Y), T ′) →(Top(X, Y), T ), we conclude that T ⊆T ′.
The balancing act follows directly from Lemma 5.2.
Theorem 5.3 If there exists an exponential topology on Top(X, Y), then it is unique.
Proof. Suppose T and T ′ are exponential topologies on Top(X, Y). Since T is splitting
and T ′ is conjoining, we have T ⊆T ′. And vice versa: we have T ′ ⊆T since T ′ is
splitting and T is conjoining.
The catch, as you might have guessed, is that there might not exist an exponential topology
on Top(X, Y)—there may be a gap between the splitting topologies and the conjoining
topologies on Top(X, Y). So at this point, you might wonder about taking an “adjoint
functor theorem” approach to ﬁnding a right adjoint to the functor X × −: Top →Top. To
do so, we would have to explore the extent to which X × −preserves colimits. Whether
X ×−preserves colimits depends on X. The spaces X for which the functor X ×−preserves
colimits were characterized in 1970 as those spaces that are core-compact (Day and Kelly,
1970). We’ll skip the deﬁnition of core-compact here, except to say that a Hausdorff space
is core-compact if and only if it is locally compact. It follows that for a locally compact
Hausdorff space X, there does exist an exponential topology on Top(X, Y) for any space
Y. Even better, this exponential topology, when X is locally compact Hausdorff, coincides
with what is classically called the compact-open topology (Fox, 1945). So, at least when X
is locally compact and Hausdorff, we can get started thinking about the desired categorical
properties of mapping spaces using ideas in classical topology. This is what we do in the
next few sections.
Before going on to the compact-open topology, we should give a general categorical
deﬁnition. In any category C that has ﬁnite products, one can ask if for all X, Y ∈C the set
C(X, Y) can be considered as an object in C and if so, whether it supports a product-hom
adjunction X × −: C
C: C(X, −). If the answer is yes, then the category is referred to

104
Chapter 5
as Cartesian closed. The fact that exponential topologies do not always exist implies that
the category Top is not Cartesian closed. One might try to ﬁnd a “convenient” category
of topological spaces in which the product-hom adjunction holds that is also rich enough
to contain the spaces we care about (Brown, 2006; Isbell, 1975; Steenrod, 1967; Stacey
et al., 2019). One might guess that locally compact Hausdorff spaces are such a category.
But no. Nevermind that we might want some non-Hausdorff spaces. If X and Y are both
locally compact and Hausdorff, then Top(X, Y) may not be. In the ﬁnal section 5.7 of this
chapter, we discuss the search for a convenient Cartesian closed category of topological
spaces. That discussion will involve a shift in perspective that, once again, is illuminated
with adjunctions.
5.6.1
The Compact-Open Topology
Let’s now deﬁne the compact-open topology, and try to give you a feel for it.
Deﬁnition 5.4 Let X and Y be topological spaces. For each compact set K ⊆X and each
open set U ⊆Y, deﬁne S (K, U) := {f ∈Top(X, Y) | f K ⊆U}. The sets S (K, U) form a
subbasis for a topology on Top(X, Y) called the compact-open topology.
Notice that a subbasis for the product topology on Top(X, Y) consists of sets
S (F, U) = {(f : X →Y) | f F ⊆U}
where F ⊆X is ﬁnite and U ⊆Y is open. That is, the product topology is what one
might call the “ﬁnite-open” topology. In the case when X has the discrete topology, all
functions X →Y are continuous and the compact-open topology on Top(X, Y) coincides
with the product topology on Top(X, Y). More generally, every ﬁnite set is compact, so the
compact-open topology is ﬁner than the product-topology. As a consequence, fewer ﬁlters
converge in the compact-open topology than in the product topology.
In fact, a closer look at convergence can give you a good feel for the difference between
the product topology and the compact-open topology. Let’s start by looking at sequences.
A sequence of functions {fn : [0, 1] →[0, 1]}n∈N converges to a limiting function f in
the product topology if and only if the sequence converges pointwise. On the other hand, a
sequence of functions {fn : [0, 1] →[0, 1]}n∈N converges to f in the compact-open topology
if and only if the sequence converges uniformly. To see this, consider a more general
situation. Suppose that X is compact and Y is a metric space. Then Top(X, Y) becomes a
metric space with the metric deﬁned by
d(f, g) := sup
x∈X
d(f x, gx)
Two functions f, g ∈Top(X, Y) are close in this metric if their values f x and gx are close
for all points x ∈X. A sequence {fn} in Top(X, Y) converges to f in this metric topology
if and only if for all ε > 0 there exists an n ∈N so that for all k > n and for all x ∈X,

Adjunctions and the Compact-Open Topology
105
d(fkx, gkx) < ε. The fact that when X is compact and Y is a metric space the compact-open
topology coincides with this metric topology is the content of the next theorem. First, a
lemma.
Lemma 5.3 Let X be a metric space and let U be open. For every compact set K ⊆U,
there is an ε > 0 so that for any x ∈K and any y ∈X ∖U, d(x, y) > ε.
Proof. This is a straightforward argument using the deﬁnition of compactness.
Theorem 5.4 Let X be compact and Y be a metric space. The compact-open topology on
Top(X, Y) is the same as the metric topology.
Proof. Let f ∈Top(X, Y) and ε > 0 be given. Consider B(f, ε). We’ll ﬁnd a set O
that is open in the compact-open topology, with f ∈O ⊆B(f, ε). Hence, compact-open
neighborhoods of f reﬁne the metric neighborhoods of f, proving that the compact-open
topology is ﬁner than the metric topology. Now, since X is compact, its image f X is
compact. Since the collection

for each i = 1, . . . , n. Therefore, f is in the open set O := ∩n
i=1S (Ki, Ui). To see that
O ⊆B(f, ε), let g ∈O. If x ∈Ki for some i, we have f x, gx ∈Ui since f, g ∈S (Ki, Ui).
Therefore,
d(f x, gx) ≤d(f x, f xi) + d(f xi, gx) = ε

2 = ε
Since the balls

cover f X, the compact sets {Ki} cover X and every point x lies
in Ki for some i. Therefore, d(f x, gx) < ε for every x ∈X, and so d(f, g) < ε in Top(X, Y).
To show that the metric topology is ﬁner than the compact-open topology, let K ⊆X be
compact, U ⊆Y be open, and consider f ∈S (K, U). From Lemma 5.3, we know there
exists a ﬁxed ε > 0 so that for any y ∈f K and any y′ ∈Y ∖fU, d(y, y′) ≥ε. Then if
g ∈B(f, ε), we have d(f x, gx) < ε for every x ∈X. Therefore, if x ∈K, then gx ∈U, and
we see that gK ⊆U. This proves B(f, ε) ⊆S (K, U). If O = S (K1, U1) ∩· · · ∩S (Kn, Un) is
any basic open set in the compact-open topology, we have the open metric ball B(f, ε) ⊆O
where ε = min{ε1, . . . , εn}. This proves that every basic open set in the compact-open
topology is open in the metric topology and hence the metric-topology is ﬁner than the
compact-open topology.

106
Chapter 5
Now that we’ve given a feel for the compact-open topology, let’s look at it in the context
of mapping spaces. The ﬁrst thing to notice is that the compact-open topology is coarse
enough to be splitting.
Theorem 5.5 For any spaces X and Y, the compact-open topology on Top(X, Y) is split-
ting.
Proof. Let Z be any space, and suppose g: X × Z →Y is continuous. To show that
the adjunct ˆg: Z →Top(X, Y) is continuous, consider a subbasic open set S (K, U) in
Top(X, Y). We need to show that (ˆg)−1S (K, U) = {z ∈Z | g(K, z) ⊆U} is open in Z. Let
z ∈(ˆg)−1S (K, U). So, z ∈Z and g(K, z) ⊆U. Since g is continuous, we know that g−1U =
{(x, z) | g(x, z) ⊆U} is open in X × Z and contains K × {z}. Therefore, the Tube Lemma
says there are open sets V and W with K ⊆V and z ∈W with K × {z} ⊆V × W ⊆g−1U.
Then, z ∈W ⊆(ˆg)−1S (K, U) as needed.
Theorem 5.6 If X is locally compact and Hausdorff and Y is any space, then the compact-
open topology on Top(X, Y) is exponential.
Proof. We only need to check that the compact-open topology is conjoining, and this is
equivalent to showing that the evaluation map eval: X × Top(X, Y) →Y is continuous at
every point (x, f). Let (x, f) ∈X × Top(X, Y), and let U ⊆Y be an open set containing the
evaluation eval(x, f) = f x. Because f is continuous, f −1U is an open set in X containing
x. Since X is locally compact and Hausdorff, there exists an open set V ⊆X with K := V
compact and x ∈V ⊆K ⊆f −1U. This implies that f x ∈f K ⊆U. Then V × S (K, U) is an
open set in X × Top(X, Y) with (x, f) ∈V × S (K, U) and eval(V × S (K, U)) ⊆U.
And thus, when X is locally compact and Hausdorff and Top(X, Y) is equipped with the
compact-open topology, we have the desired property listed at the opening of section 5.6.
As an application, let’s prove theorem 2.20 from chapter 2. We begin with a lemma.
Lemma 5.4 If f : X →Y is a quotient map and Z is locally compact and Hausdorff, then
f × idZ : X × Z →Y × Z is a quotient map.
Proof. Let f : X →Y be a quotient map. We want to prove that the product Y × Z has the
quotient topology inherited from the map f × idZ. So consider Y × Z with two possibly
distinct topologies: (Y × Z)p will denote the product topology, and (Y × Z)q will denote the
quotient topology inherited from the map f × idZ : X × Z →Y × Z.
The universal property of the quotient topology tells us which maps out of (Y × Z)q are
continuous. In particular, id: (Y × Z)q →(Y × Z)p is continuous since f × idZ : X × Z →
(Y×Z)p is continuous. That is, in the diagram below, the dashed map is continuous because

the solid diagonal is continuous.
X × Z
(Y × Z)q
(Y × Z)p
f×idZ
π
id
So we only have to prove that the identity in the other direction id: (Y × Z)p →(Y × Z)q
is continuous. Since Z is locally compact Hausdorff, it sufﬁces to prove that the adjunct
bid: Y →Top(Z, (Y × Z)q) is continuous. As a map out of Y, bid will be continuous if its
precomposition with the quotient map f is continuous. That is, in the diagram below, the
dashed map will be continuous if the solid diagonal map is continuous.

Top(Z, (Y × Z)q)

The solid diagonal map in the picture is bπ, the adjunct of the continuous quotient map
π: X × Z →(Y × Z)q, and so it is indeed continuous.
Theorem 5.7 If X1 ↠Y1 and X2 ↠Y2 are quotient maps and Y1 and X2 are locally
compact and Hausdorff, then X1 × X2 ↠Y1 × Y2 is a quotient map.
Proof. Suppose Y1 and X2 are locally compact and Hausdorff and that f1 : X1 ↠Y1 and
f2 : X2 ↠Y2 are quotient maps. By the lemma, the two maps f1 ×idX2 : X1 × X2 ↠Y1 × X2
and idY1 × f2 : Y1 × X2 ↠Y1 × Y2 are quotient maps. Therefore the composition
 idY1 ×f2
 ◦  f1 × idX2
 : X1 × X2 ↠Y1 × Y2
is a quotient map.
In the next section, we’ll give an application to analysis. Unlike Rn, whose compact subsets
are nicely characterized by the Heine-Borel theorem as the sets that are closed and bounded,
it’s not always easy to decide when a subset of Top(X, Y) is compact. Ascoli’s theorem in
the next section provides a criterion.

108
Chapter 5
5.6.2
The Theorems of Ascoli and Arzela
It’s not difﬁcult to decide when a family of functions is compact using the product topology.
Theorem 5.8 If X is any space and Y is Hausdorff, then a subset A ⊆Top(X, Y) has
compact closure in the product topology if and only if for each x ∈X, the set Ax = {f x ∈
Y | f ∈A} has compact closure in Y.
Proof. This was exercise 2.19 at the end of chapter 2.
If we can identify families of functions for which the product topology and the compact-
open topology coincide, then we have necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for such families
to be compact in the compact-open topology. The following deﬁnition provides a common
way to make such an identiﬁcation.
Deﬁnition 5.5 Let X be a topological space and (Y, d) be a metric space. A family A ⊆
Top(X, Y) is called equicontinuous at x ∈X if and only if for every ε > 0, there exists an
open neighborhood U of x so that for every u ∈U and for every f ∈A, d(f x, fu) < ε. If
F is equicontinuous for every x ∈X, the family A is simply called equicontinuous.
So a family of functions is equicontinuous if, within a neighborhood, one can bound the
variation of every function in the family by a single epsilon. For this section, the most
important facts about equicontinuous families are that the compact-open topology agrees
with the product topology on them and that their closures are also equicontinuous. We
leave the proofs of these two facts as exercises for you to solve.
Lemma 5.5 Let X be a topological space and (Y, d) be a metric space. If A ⊆Top(X, Y)
is an equicontinuous family, then the subspace topology on A of Top(X, Y) with compact-
open topology is the same as the subspace topology on A of Top(X, Y) with the product
topology.
Lemma 5.6 If A ⊆Top(X, Y) is equicontinuous, then the closure of A in Top(X, Y) using
the product topology is also equicontinuous.
Putting these ideas together gives us the famous theorems of Ascoli and Arzela.
Ascoli’s Theorem
Let X be locally compact Hausdorff, and let (Y, d) be a metric space.
A family F ⊆Top(X, Y) has compact closure if and only if F is equicontinuous and for
every x ∈X, the set Fx := {f x | f ∈F } has compact closure.
Arzela’s Theorem
Let X be compact, (Y, d) be a metric space and {fn} be a sequence
of functions in Top(X, Y). If {fn} is equicontinuous and if for each x ∈X the set {fnx} is
bounded, then {fn} has a subsequence that converges uniformly.

Adjunctions and the Compact-Open Topology

5.6.3
Enrich the Product-Hom Adjunction in Top
In the case that Top(X, Y) has an exponential topology, we know it’s unique. Let’s introduce
some notation for it.
Deﬁnition 5.6 Deﬁne the space YX to be the set Top(X, Y) with its exponential topology,
provided it exists.
Suppose we have an exponential topology on Top(X, Y) and use YX to denote it. We have
a bijection of sets
Top(Z × X, Y)  Top(Z, YX)
(5.3)
Now, we can put the compact-open topology on these mapping spaces. One can then ask
the question: under what conditions is the bijection of sets in (5.3) a homeomorphism?
One answer is: when X is locally compact and Hausdorff and when Z is Hausdorff. In-
stead of proving this (as done in Hatcher, 2002, 529–532), let’s prove a slightly weaker
version by assuming that Z is, additionally, locally compact. Then the compact open topol-
ogy Top(Z, YX) will be exponential. Also, since the product of locally compact Hausdorff
spaces is locally compact Hausdorff (exercise 2.9 at the end of chapter 2), the compact
open topology on Top(Z × X, Y) will be exponential. So, we’re looking at proving that
YZ×X 

YXZ
The payoff in proving the weaker version is that we have a lot more adjunctions available
and we can give a clean, categorical argument, as in Strickland (2009), without diving in
to the topologies themselves.
Theorem 5.9 If X and Z are locally compact Hausdorff, then for any space Y, the isomor-
phism of sets Top(Z × X, Y) →Top(Z, Top(X, Y)) is a homeomorphsim of spaces.
Proof. Throughout this proof, remember that for any spaces A and C, the compact open
topology on Top(A,C) is splitting. This means that the adjunct of a continuous map A ×
B →C, which is a function B →Top(A,C), is also continuous. Also, if B is locally
compact and Hausdorff, then for any space C, the compact open topology on Top(B,C) is
conjoining. This is equivalent to the statement that for any space C, the evaluation map
B × Top(B,C) →Top(C) is continuous.
Now suppose X and Z are locally compact Hausdorff. Because X is locally compact
Hausdorff, the evaluation map X × (YZ)X →YZ is continuous. Also, because Z is lo-
cally compact Hausdorff, the evaluation map Z × YZ →Y is continuous. Therefore, the
composition
Z × X × (YZ)X →Z × YZ →Y
is continuous. Now, to keep things clear, set A = Z × X and set B = (YZ)X. We have a
continuous function g: A × B →Y. Since the compact-open topology is always splitting,
the adjunct ˆg: B →Top(A, Y) of the map g is continuous. Restoring A = Z × X and

110
Chapter 5
B = (YZ)X reveals that the map ˆg: (YZ)X →Top(Z × X, Y) is continuous. This map ˆg is
precisely the map that we want to show is a homeomorphism. We’ve shown it’s continuous,
so we’re halfway done.
Because Z × X is locally compact Hausdorff, the evaluation map
Z × X × YZ×X →Y
is continuous. Now, thinking of this as a continuous map from Z×−, its adjunct X×YZ×X →
YZ is continuous. And again. Finally, thinking of this as a continuous map from X × −,
we conclude its adjunct YZ×X →(YZ)X is continuous. This is the inverse of the continuous
map ˆg in the previous paragraph, completing the proof.
Now, let’s make some concluding remarks about the compact-open topology on Top(X, Y)
when X is locally compact Hausdorff. From a certain point of view, it’s insufﬁcient to work
with locally compact Hausdorff spaces. For example, these spaces are not closed under
many common constructions. The colimit of the following diagram of locally compact
Hausdorff spaces
R ,→R2 ,→R3 ,→· · ·
is not locally compact. Moreover, even if X is locally compact and Hausdorff, YX with the
compact-open topology may not be locally compact and Hausdorff, so the construction of
a topology on a mapping space is not repeatable. One solution to all these issues involves
more adjunctions—“k-iﬁcation” and “weak-Hausdorﬁcation.” This is the next topic.
5.7
Compactly Generated Weakly Hausdorff Spaces
Here, we present a bird’s eye view of constructing a topology on Top(X, Y) in a more
general setting. The main idea is to ﬁnd a “convenient category” of topological spaces
which has limits and colimits, has exponential objects with the desirable property listed
in section 5.6, and is large enough to contain the spaces we care about. The category
of compactly generated weakly Hausdorff spaces is such a category. The importance of
compactly generated spaces for topologies on function spaces was recognized early on
by Brown (1964). A categorical perspective along the lines we present here, including
the behavior of compactly generated spaces under limits, occurred later (Steenrod, 1967).
Finally, Hausdorff was replaced with weakly Hausdorff yielding what is often considered
the most convenient category of topological spaces (McCord, 1969).
Be aware that the terminology is not used consistently in the literature. For example,
“compactly generated” in May (1999) means what we call “compactly generated and weak
Hausdorff.” Here we err on over-adjectivized terminology in an effort to avoid any confu-
sion, especially since we omit most of the proofs. We’ll start with a few deﬁnitions.

Adjunctions and the Compact-Open Topology
111
Deﬁnition 5.7 A space X is compactly generated if and only if for all compact spaces K
and continuous maps f : K →X, the set f −1A being closed (or open) implies A is closed
(or open).
Deﬁnition 5.8 A space X is weakly Hausdorff if and only if for all compact spaces K and
continuous maps f : K →X, the image f K is closed in X.
Deﬁnition 5.9 Let CG, WH, and CGWH denote the full subcategories of compactly gen-
erated, weakly Hausdorff, and compactly generated weakly Hausdorff spaces, respectively.
Example 5.4 The category CG includes all locally compact spaces and all ﬁrst countable
spaces. The category CGWH includes locally compact Hausdorff spaces and metric spaces.
Notice that weakly Hausdorff lies between T1 and T2. The interested reader will ﬁnd these
properties are all distinct by searching for examples in Steen and Seebach (1995).
The reader might recall from chapter 1 that we introduced constructions of topologies in
three ways: ﬁrst, with a classic deﬁnition, which described the open sets; second, with a
better deﬁnition that characterized the topology among a set of possible topologies; and
third, with a still better deﬁnition, which characterized which functions into or out of the
construction are continuous. Let’s describe k-iﬁcation in these three ways. Let X be any
space. First, one can deﬁne a topology on X to consist of all sets U so that f −1U is open
for some continuous f : K →X from a compact space K. This topology is compactly
generated. In fact, it is the smallest compactly generated topology containing the original
topology on X. It is further characterized by the property that a function g: X →Y out of X
with this topology is continuous if and only for all compact K and all functions f : K →X,
g f : K →Y is continuous. The set X with this compactly generated topology is called the
k-iﬁcation of X and is denoted by kX. The k-iﬁcation of a map f : X →Y is the map f
viewed as a map kX →kY, which will be continuous. Thus, k-iﬁcation deﬁnes a functor
k: Top →CG.
Theorem 5.10 The following setup is an adjunction: U : CG
Top: k, where U is the
inclusion of CG →Top and k is the k-iﬁcation functor.
Proof. Proved as theorem 3.2 in Steenrod (1967).
Theorem 5.1 then implies that k preserves limits and U preserves colimits. The statement
that k preserves limits implies that the limit of a diagram in Top is sent by k to the limit
of the k-iﬁcation of the diagram. To clarify what this means, consider two compactly
generated spaces X and Y. The product X × Y in Top may not be compactly generated, but
k(X × Y) is the product of X and Y in CG. This means that k(X × Y) satisﬁes the universal
property to be a product for compactly generated spaces. The quantiﬁer in the universal
property for the product k(X × Y) involves fewer spaces, and so in general, the topology on
k(X × Y) is ﬁner than the topology on X × Y.

112
Chapter 5
Now, the consequences of U being a left adjoint means that U preserves colimits. This
means that if a diagram in CG has a colimit in CG, then it must agree with the colimit of
the diagram in Top. While there’s no obvious reason that colimits in CG need exist, it is
nevertheless true.
Theorem 5.11 CG is a cocomplete category.
Proof. See appendix A of Lewis (1978).
Now let’s add weakly Hausdorff to the picture with an analogous “weak-Hausdorfﬁﬁcation”
functor q. Let X be any space. We deﬁne the weakly Hausdorff space qX to be the quotient
of X by the smallest closed equivalence relation in X × X. You can think about what the
open sets of qX are and how to characterize which functions into or out of (which will it
be?) qX are continuous.
Theorem 5.12 There is an adjunction q: CG
CGWH: U where U is the inclusion of
CGWH →CG.
Proof. See appendix A of Lewis (1978).
As a consequence, take a diagram in CGWH. The colimit of this diagram may not be
weakly Hausdorff, but it is compactly generated by theorem 5.11. Then apply the functor
q, which as a left adjoint preserves colimits and hence yields a space in CGWH that must
be the colimit of the diagram in CGWH.
As for limits, if a diagram in CGWH has a limit in CGWH, then it must agree with the
limit of the diagram in CG. While there’s no obvious reason that limits in CGWH need
exist, it is nevertheless true.
Theorem 5.13 CGWH is a complete category.
Proof. See proposition 2.22 in Strickland (2009).
The upshot of this back and forth game between adjoint functors produces a category
CGWH that is closed under limits and colimits. But be careful of multiple interpretations.
For example, for two compactly generated weakly Hausdorff spaces X and Y, we have the
“old” product, denoted by X ×o Y, which is the product in Top. We also have the new
product, denoted by X × Y, which is the product in CGWH.
Now, for compactly generated weakly Hausdorff spaces X and Y, let YX = kTop(X, Y).
That is, the topology we put on the space of maps from X to Y is the k-iﬁcation of the
compact-open topology.
Theorem 5.14 If X and Y are CGWH, then YX is in CGWH. For a ﬁxed X, the assignment
Y 7→YX deﬁnes a functor −X : CGWH →CGWH that ﬁts into the adjunction
X × −: CGWH
CGWH: −X

inducing homeomorphisms of spaces YX×Z  (YX)Z.
Proof. See Lewis (1978).
Corollary 5.14.1 For X, Y, Z ∈CGWH,
(i)
the functor −× X preserves colimits.
(ii)
the functor −X preserves limits.
(iii)
the functor Y−takes colimits to limits.
(iv)
composition ZY × YX →ZX is continuous.
(v)
evaluation eval: X × YX →Y is continuous.
Thus, the category CGWH is Cartesian closed. The category of compactly generated
weakly Hausdorff spaces has other good properties, too. We recommend the excellent
notes in Strickland (2009) for statements and proofs.
We opened this chapter with the idea that relaxing a notion of equivalence can result in
rich mathematics. As we’ve seen, the data of an adjunction L ⊣R is similar to, but not
quite the same as, the data of an equivalence between categories C and D. This relaxed
version provides a characterization about relationships between objects in these categories:
if you know all morphisms LX →Y in D, then you know all morphisms X →RY in C,
and vice versa. When the category of interest is Top and X is a locally compact Hausdorff
space, the compact-open topology provides a bijection of mapping spaces Top(X × Z, Y) 
Top(Z, Top(X, Y)) for all spaces Y and Z. More generally, the functors X × −and C(X, −)
form an adjoint pair when the category C is a convenient one, such as CGWH.
In the next chapter, we’ll again use a loosened-up version of equivalence—homotopy
equivalence—to motivate other rich constructions and adjunctions in topology. As intro-
duced in chapter 1, a homotopy between functions f, g: X →Y is a map h: I × X →Y
with h(0, −) = f and h(1, −) = g. Since the unit interval is locally compact and Hausdorff,
there is a bijection Top(I × X, Y)  Top(X, Top(I, Y)) for all spaces X and Y. On the left
are homotopies and on the right are maps into Top(I, Y), the space of all paths in Y. This
dual perspective, together with the ideas in this chapter, naturally leads to a discussion on
homotopy, path spaces, and more adjunctions that arise in topology.

In certain situations (such as descent theorems for fundamental groups `a la van Kampen) it is much
more elegant, even indispensable for understanding something, to work with fundamental groupoids
with respect to a suitable packet of base points....
—Alexander Grothendieck (1997)
Introduction. Chapter 0 introduced the categorical theme that objects are completely determined
by their relationships with other objects. It has origins in theorem 0.1, a corollary of the Yoneda
lemma stating that objects X and Y in a category are isomorphic if and only if the corresponding
sets Top(Z, X) and Top(Z, Y) are isomorphic for all objects Z. This notion of gleaning information
by “probing” one object with another is used extensively throughout algebraic topology where a
famously useful probing object for topological spaces is the circle S 1 (and the sphere S n, more
generally).
A continuous map S 1 →X is a loop within the space X, so comparing Top(S 1, X) and Top(S 1, Y)
amounts to comparing the set of all loops within X and Y. In practice, however, these are massively
complicated sets. To declutter the situation, it’s better to consider homotopy classes of loops, where
loops aren’t distinguished if one can be reshaped continuously to another. The question arises: “What
are the most ‘fundamental’ loops in X, and do they differ from those in Y?” To simplify things further,
it helps to consider only those loops that start and end at a ﬁxed point in X. The set of such homotopy
classes of loops forms a group called the fundamental group of X at the chosen point, which deﬁnes
the object assignment of a functor Top →Grp. And with this, the meaning of “algebraic topology”
begins to come to life.
These ideas motivate a more general categorical study of pointed topological spaces and homotopy
classes of maps between them. That is the goal of this chapter. Along the way, we’ll encounter an
interesting zoo of examples of such spaces; natural maps between them; and various adjunctions
involving paths, loops, cylinders, cones, suspensions, wedges, and smashes. We open with a brief re-
fresher in section 6.1 on homotopies and alternate ways of viewing them. In section 6.2 we motivate
homotopy classes of based loops as a special case of a general construction called the fundamental
groupoid. Focusing on “pointed” topological spaces in section 6.3 results in the fundamental group.
We then analyze the pointed version of the product-hom adjunction, called the smash-hom adjunc-
tion, in section 6.4, and specializing yet further we obtain the suspension-loop adjunction in section
6.5. This adjunction and accompanying results on ﬁbrations in section 6.6 provide a wonderfully
short proof that the fundamental group of the circle is Z. In section 6.6.3 we will showcase four

Chapter 6
applications of this result, and in section 6.7 we’ll introduce the Seifert van Kampen theorem and use
it to compute the fundamental groups of other familiar topological spaces.
6.1
Cylinder-Free Path Adjunction
Adjunctions provide us with several different but equivalent pictures of homotopies. As
usual, let I = [0, 1]. Recall from section 1.6 that a homotopy h: I × X →Y between maps
f and g is a map from I × X →Y that on one end is the map f = h(0, −): X →Y and the
other end is the map g = h(1, −): X →Y. When such a homotopy exists, f and g are said
to be homotopic, and we’ll write f ≃g. In this setup, one usually thinks of continuously
reshaping f into g over time, which is parametrized by the unit interval. Because I is
locally compact and Hausdorff, there is an adjunction between the functors I × −and (−)I.
We call the setup
I × −: Top
Top: (−)I
the cylinder-free path adjunction since for a space X the space I × X is the cylinder on X
and XI is the space of paths in X. These paths are described as “free” to contrast them
with a based path space—the space of all paths beginning at a given point—which we’ll
consider later on.
Under the cylinder-free path adjunction, there is a bijection Top(I × X, Y)  Top(X, YI)
for any space Y. On the left-hand side are homotopies between maps X →Y; on the
right-hand side are maps that associate a point in X to a path in Y. This bijection is fairly
intuitive. Suppose that h is a homotopy from f to g. Then for each x ∈X there is a path in
Y from f x to gx. Simply ﬁx x during the homotopy h: I × X →Y. This path is precisely
the adjunct of h evaluated at x. So a homotopy can be viewed as a function from X to the
paths in Y whose value at each x is a path from f x to gx.

Let’s consider yet another way to view homotopies. For any spaces X and Y, the compact-
open topology on YX is splitting, so we have an injection
Top(X × I, Y) →Top(I, YX)
So a homotopy may also be viewed as a map I →YX. That is, a homotopy from f to g can
be viewed as a path from the point f to the point g within the space of continuous functions
YX. If X is locally compact Hausdorff, or if we’re working in the category CGWH using
the k-iﬁed product and k-iﬁed compact-open topologies, then YX×I  (YX)I and so every
path in the mapping space YX deﬁnes a homotopy.
As the next theorems show, the space X, the cylinder X ×I, and the free path space XI are
indistinguishable in the eyes of homotopy theory. That is, these three spaces are homotopy
equivalent. Homotopy equivalence was introduced in section 1.6; we’ll restate it here for
ease of reference.
Deﬁnition 6.1 Topological spaces X and Y are called homotopy equivalent if and only
if there exist maps f : X →Y and g: Y →X with fg ≃idY and g f ≃idX. In this
case, we write X ≃Y and f (or g) is called a homotopy equivalence. The category hTop
is the category whose objects are spaces and whose morphisms are homotopy classes of
continuous maps. So, X ≃Y if and only if X  Y in hTop.
Theorem 6.1 The map π: XI →X deﬁned by γ 7→γ0 and the map i: X →XI deﬁned by
x 7→cx, the constant path at x, are homotopy inverses.
Proof. Note that iπ: XI →XI is the map that sends a path γ to cγ1, the constant path at
γ1. Let h: XI × I →XI by h(γ, t) = γt where γt : I →X is given by γts = γ(s + t −st).
Then h(γ, 0) = γ and h(γ, 1) = cγ1, and we see h is a homotopy between idXI and iπ. Since
πi = idX, there’s nothing more to check.
Theorem 6.2 The map i: X →X×I deﬁned by x 7→(x, 1) and the projection p: X×I →X
are homotopy inverses.

Chapter 6
In any discussion on paths and homotopy, one is prompted to think of homotopies between
paths. Category theory provides a good setting in which to explore this. To every space,
one can associate to it a category whose objects are the points in that space and whose
morphisms are homotopy classes of paths between those points. This category is called the
fundamental groupoid.
6.2
The Fundamental Groupoid and Fundamental Group
Let’s ﬁrst warm up with a few words about groupoids in general. As the name suggests, a
groupoid is like a group. The connection is clear when one views groups from a categorical
perspective.
A group, as noted in chapter 0, is a category with a single object where every morphism
is an isomorphism. A groupoid is a slight generalization of this.
Deﬁnition 6.2 A groupoid is a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism.
For example, a category with two objects, each with identity morphisms, and an invertible
morphism between the two is a groupoid.
•
◦
•

groupoid
So groupoids are categories that are like groups but have possibly more than one object.
For this reason, groupoids are a great way to gain intuition or inspiration when working
with ideas in category theory. For example, ignoring the direction of arrows in a category
results in a groupoid and hence in a structure that is very much like a group. In that sense,
you might hope to “lift” theorems about groups to theorems about groupoids and then to
theorems about categories. The Yoneda lemma is an example of this. It can be viewed as
a lifting of Cayley’s theorem in group theory—think about what the Yoneda lemma says
when the category in question is a group.
Groupoids also appear naturally in topology when considering paths in a space. Think of
a space as a category whose objects are the points in the space, and picture the morphisms
to be paths between points. This doesn’t quite work, though. The complication is that
composition of paths isn’t quite associative since the parametrization, and not just the
image, is involved for paths deﬁned as maps from the unit interval. But composition of
paths is associative up to path homotopy. Path homotopy was deﬁned in chapter 1. For
convenience, we’ll restate it here, using f and g for paths instead of α and β because we’re
about to think of paths as morphisms.

Paths, Loops, Cylinders, Suspensions, . . .
119
Deﬁnition 6.3 Two paths f, g: I →X from x to y in a space X are path homotopic if and
only if there exists a homotopy h: I × I →X from f to g that satisﬁes h(0, t) = x and
h(1, t) = y for all t.
Under the product-hom adjunction, the homotopy may be viewed as a map I →XI that
lands in the subspace of XI consisting of paths with ﬁxed endpoints in X. A picture to
have in mind is the cartoon below, which illustrates a simple homotopy between paths f
and g. The picture can be interpreted in two equivalent ways. First, you can think of the
homotopy as an extension of the paths to the shaded region. At each time t there is a path
h(−, t) from x to y. As t ranges from 0 to 1, one imagines f traversing the shaded region
toward g. Alternatively, the homotopy can be viewed as a continuously varying family of
paths from f to g. Indeed, for each point s ∈I there is a path from f s to gs.
x
y
f
g
h(−, t)
f s
gs
f
g
h(s, −)
Given any two points x, y ∈X and a path f from one to the other, we’ll be interested in
the class [f] of all paths from x to y that are path-homotopic to f. Points in X together with
homotopy classes [f] deﬁne a groupoid.
Deﬁnition 6.4 The fundamental groupoid π1X of a space X is the category whose objects
are points of X. A morphism x →y is a homotopy class of paths from x to y. Composition
is given by concatenation of paths [g] ◦[f] := [g · f].
As introduced in section 2.1, if one has a path f and a path g, which begins where f ends,
then their concatenation g · f is also a path, deﬁned by
(g · f)t =

Chapter 6
This deﬁnition provides composition in π1X, making π1X into a category. There are a
few things to verify. First, check that composition is well deﬁned: if f ′ ≃f and g′ ≃g
then g′· f ′ ≃g· f. Also check that composition of homotopy classes of paths is associative,
i.e., (h · g) · f ≃h · (g · f) for any three composable paths f, g, h. Finally, check that the
homotopy class of the constant path at a point x is the identity morphism idx. One further
shows that π1X is a groupoid by running paths in reverse. That is, for any path f from x to
y, deﬁne a path g by gt := f(1 −t). This is a path from y to x and it satisﬁes [g][f] = idx
and [f][g] = idy. So every morphism in π1X is an isomorphism.
Now consider the category Grpd whose objects are small groupoids and whose mor-
phisms are functors between groupoids. It is not difﬁcult to check that the fundamental
groupoid deﬁnes a functor π1 : Top →Grpd. There’s no question about what π1 does
on Top(X, Y).
The pushforward of a morphism α ∈Top(X, Y) gives a map on paths
α∗: XI →YI. One only needs to check that α∗respects homotopy equivalence.
As a general remark, in any category C one can ﬁx an object X ∈C and consider the
set of all isomorphisms from X to itself. Under composition, this set forms a group Aut X.
In particular, ﬁxing an object x0 ∈X in the fundamental groupoid π1X yields a one-object
category consisting of all isomorphisms from x0 to itself. It is called the fundamental group
of X based at the point x0 and is denoted by π1(X, x0).
Deﬁnition 6.5 The fundamental group of X based at the point x0 is the group π1(X, x0) of
homotopy classes of loops based at x0 ∈X.
As another general remark, if G is a groupoid and x is any object in G, then Aut x thought
of as a category with one object is a full subcategory of G. (Here we momentarily denote
our object x with a lowercase letter, bearing in mind points in a topological space.) The
inclusion of Aut x into the category G deﬁnes a fully faithful functor. If G is connected,
meaning that there is a morphism between any two objects, then the inclusion of Aut x as a
subcategory of G is also essentially surjective. Therefore, for any object x of a connected
groupoid, there is an equivalence of categories between the group Aut x and the groupoid
G. So, for any path connected space X, the fundamental group is equivalent as a category
to the fundamental groupoid, and moreover, for any x0, x1 ∈X, the fundamental groups are
isomorphic π1(X, x0)  π1(X, x1).
Before we compute and make use of fundamental groups, we will spend the next section
giving another interpretation of the fundamental group that is very good to know. Notice
that a loop that begins and ends at a point x0 is the same as a continuous function from the
circle S 1 to X that sends the point (1, 0) ∈S 1 to the point x0 ∈X. In this way, π1(X, x0)
may be viewed as homotopy classes of basepoint-preserving maps S 1 →X; that is, maps
that send a chosen point in S 1 to a chosen point in X. An effective, categorical way to
treat basepoint-preserving maps is to consider a pair of spaces together with a point (X, x0)
as a single object and to think of basepoint-preserving maps as morphisms between these
single objects.

Paths, Loops, Cylinders, Suspensions, . . .

6.3
The Categories of Pairs and Pointed Spaces
Deﬁne the category of pairs of topological spaces to be the category whose objects are pairs
(X, A) where X is a topological space and A is a subspace of X. A morphism f : (X, A) →
(Y, B) is a continuous function f : X →Y with f A ⊆B. When we consider pairs for
which the subset A consists of a single point, we obtain the category Top∗of pointed
topological spaces. Objects in Top∗are pairs (X, x0) where X is a topological space and
x0 is a designated point in X called the basepoint. A morphism is a continuous function
f : (X, x0) →(Y, y0) with f x0 = y0. Such maps are said to preserve or respect basepoints.
Sometimes we’ll write X for the pair (X, x0) if it’s understood that X has a basepoint
x0 ∈X. In the case when X is locally compact and Hausdorff so that Top(X, Y) with the
compact-open topology is exponential, then the set Top∗(X, Y) becomes a pointed space
itself; it gets a topology as a subspace of Top(X, Y), and its basepoint is the constant map
from X to the basepoint of Y.
It can be tempting to think that a choice of a basepoint in a space is only a matter of
bookkeeping and that Top and Top∗may not be too different. But the categories do differ
and in signiﬁcant ways. For starters, colimits in Top∗are different than in Top. For exam-
ple, the one-point space ∗is both terminal and initial in Top∗, but it is not initial in Top. As
we’ll see in the next section, coproducts differ as well, though products do not.
Homotopies are more straightforward. A homotopy between spaces in Top∗is required
to respect the basepoints: it’s a map h: I × X →Y such that h(t, x0) = y0 for all t ∈
I, which we’ll call a based homotopy. And just as Top has a homotopy version hTop,
so also does Top∗have a homotopy version hTop∗. This is the category whose objects
are pointed topological spaces X and whose morphisms X →Y are homotopy classes of
basepoint-preserving maps, the set of which is denoted by hTop∗(X, Y) or also by [X, Y]∗or
simply [X, Y] if it’s understood that we’re working with basepoints. If X is locally compact
and Hausdorff, then [X, Y] is itself a pointed space. It gets a topology as a quotient of
Top∗(X, Y), and its basepoint is the homotopy class of the constant map from X to the
basepoint of Y.
We opened this chapter with a particular focus on the unit interval I and corresponding
functor Top(I, −) : Top →Top. There we probed a space X with I and obtained the
space of paths XI. In the context of pointed spaces and homotopy classes of based maps, a
fruitful choice of “probing space” is the sphere. By convention, the sphere S n is a pointed
space with basepoint (1, 0, 0, . . . , 0). Sometimes we’ll refer to the basepoint of S 1 as 1
rather than (1, 0), thinking of S 1 as the set of complex numbers z with |z| = 1. So one may
consider the corresponding functor Top∗(S n, −) = [S n, −]. When n = 1 this is precisely
the fundamental group. That is, we have the interpretation of the fundamental group of a
pointed space (X, x0) as the set of homotopy classes of based maps from (S 1, 1) to (X, x0):
π1(X, x0) = [(S 1, 1), (X, x0)]

122
Chapter 6
This perspective has advantages. For one, it makes it clear that the fundamental group is
a functor π1 : Top∗→hTop∗→Set. It also makes it clear that it ﬁts into a family of
functors: for each n = 0, 1, . . . we have a homotopy functor πn := [S n, −] from Top∗to Set
called the nth homotopy group. What’s not clear is that these functors land in Grp. The
name will be justiﬁed in corollary 6.4.1 where it’s shown that πn(X, x0) is a group whenever
n ≥1.
Before moving on, we should look at the case when n = 0 since we’ve already deﬁned
a functor π0 : Top →Set in section 2.1.2. First, note that S 0 consists of the two points −1
and 1, and since any map f : (S 0, 1) →(X, x0) must preserve basepoints, we have 1 7→x0.
So the map f is the same as a choice for f(−1); that is, a point ∗→X. Since homotopies
between two such maps must also preserve basepoints, a homotopy is simply a path from
one point to the other. This is consistent with our previous discussion of π0 as the set of
path components of X. If X has a basepoint, then π0(X) is a pointed set, the basepoint being
the connected component of the basepoint of X.
So far, we’ve discussed some ideas in Top along with their based version in Top∗—
objects, morphisms, homotopies, mapping spaces. Next, we turn to the product-hom ad-
juction (X × −) ⊣Top(X, −) and its based version in Top∗. We already have the analogous
mapping space: if X and Y have basepoints x0 and y0, then Top∗(X, Y) becomes a space
as a subspace of Top(X, Y). The space Top∗(X, Y) is also based with the constant function
X 7→y0 as the basepoint. The Cartesian product X × Y also has a basepoint, (x0, y0). But
as we’ll see in the next section, the functor X × −is not left adjoint to Top∗(X, −). This
motivates a new construction in Top∗, resulting in an adjunction that is the based version
of the product-hom adjunction.
6.4
The Smash-Hom Adjunction
We’ll begin with a more categorical discussion of the product in Top∗. To start, observe that
there’s a forgetful functor U : Top∗→Top that forgets basepoints. As usual, one should
ask if it has a left adjoint. It does. The plus construction +: Top →Top∗is a left adjoint
of U deﬁned on objects by adding a point X 7→X `{∗} and on morphisms f : X →Y by
f 7→˜f where ˜f extends f by sending the extra point of X to the extra point of Y. Notice
that Top∗(+X, Y)  Top(X, UY), so we have the adjunction
+: Top∗
Top: U
This implies that U preserves limits. For example, the product of based spaces (X, x0) ×
(Y, y0) must be the product of the underlying topological spaces, and its basepoint is the
point (x0, y0). Colimits, however, are different in Top∗compared with those in Top, as we
hinted at earlier. In particular, the coproduct of pointed spaces X and Y is given a special
name: the wedge product.

Paths, Loops, Cylinders, Suspensions, . . .
123
Deﬁnition 6.6 For pointed spaces (X, x0) and (Y, y0) the wedge product X ∨Y is the quo-
tient X ⊔Y/∼where x0 ∼y0. The basepoint ∗of X ∨Y is the class [x0] = [y0].
That is, the wedge product X ∨Y is constructed by glueing X and Y together at their
basepoints, and the basepoint of the new space is the single point where the two basepoints
of X and Y have been identiﬁed. For example,
(S 2, 1)
•
(S 1, 1)
•
∨

•
(S 2 ∨S 1, ∗)
Note that there are inclusion maps
(X, x0)
(Y, y0)
(X ∨Y, ∗)
iX
iY
which together with the wedge product satisfy the following universal property. For any
pointed space (Z, z0) and any maps fX : (X, x0) →(Z, z0) and fY : (Y, y0) →(Z, z0), there
exists a unique map f : (X ∨Y, ∗) →(Z, z0) so that fX = fiX and fY = fiY.
(X, x0)
(Y, y0)
(X ∨Y, ∗)
(Z, z0)
iX
fX
iY
fY
f
We can establish this universal property for the wedge product in Top∗by using some of
the universal properties already known for familiar coproducts in Top. First observe that a
pointed space (X, x0) is the same as a space X together with a map ∗→X. So we can view
the wedge product as the pushout:
∗
Y
X
X ∨Y
⌜
The universal property for the pushout implies that for any pointed space Z, a pair of
basepoint-preserving maps X →Z and Y →Z is the same as a basepoint-preserving map
X ∨Y →Z. In other words, the wedge product is the coproduct in Top∗. We’ll use this
coproduct to give a reﬁned version of the product-hom adjunction for based spaces.

124
Chapter 6
To begin, consider the identiﬁcation Top(X×Y, Z)  Top(Y, ZX). In the context of pointed
spaces, there are a couple of things to consider. First, if x0 and z0 are basepoints in Z and
X respectively, then ZX has a basepoint given by the constant function f0 : X →z0. A map
f : Y →ZX on the right-hand side must preserve basepoints, meaning that it must satisfy
(fy0)x = z0 for all x ∈X. Additionally, for any y ∈Y the resulting map fy: X →Z must
also preserve basepoints. That is, (fy)x0 = z0 for all y ∈Y. Therefore, if the adjoint of a
map f : X × Y →Z is a basepoint preserving map Y →ZX, then f must be constant on
({x0} × Y) ∪(X × {y0}), sending it to z0. This motivates the deﬁnition of the smash product
of topological spaces.
Deﬁnition 6.7 The smash product of two pointed spaces (X, x0) and (Y, y0) is deﬁned to
be the quotient space
X ∧Y
:=
X × Y/X ∨Y
where X ∨Y is identiﬁed with the subspace ({x0} × Y) ∪(X × {y0}). It has (x0, y0) as a
basepoint.
When X is locally compact and Hausdorff, the smash product is the quotient of the product
by the minimal relation that ensures that there is a bijection of sets Top∗(X ∧Y, Z) 
Top∗(Y, ZX). So it is not surprising that the naturality of the product-hom adjunction in Top
descends to yield the smash-hom adjunction among pointed spaces:
X ∧−: Top∗
Top∗: (−)X
As we’ll see next, an important case of the smash-hom adjuntion arises when X is taken to
be the circle.
6.5
The Suspension-Loop Adjunction
There is a special name given to the smash product of the circle with a pointed space X—
the reduced suspension of X. One can also smash X with the unit interval to obtain the
reduced cone over X.
Deﬁnition 6.8 For a pointed space (X, x0), the reduced cone CX and the reduced suspen-
sion are given by
CX := X ∧I
and
ΣX := X ∧S 1

for all x, x′ ∈X and s, t ∈I, and the basepoints of CX and ΣX are the classes [x0] = {x0}×I.
Simple sketches show that they look like quotients of (i) a cone drawn up from X to a point
and (ii) a copy of X suspended between two points—one above, one below—as though by
rigging lines. See ﬁgure 6.1.

Now, if X does not have a basepoint, then we have the analogous “unreduced” construc-
tions.

While the terminology may be new, suspensions arise in a familiar context: compactiﬁca-
tions. The one-point compactiﬁcation of R, for example, is the circle S 1, and the one-point
compactiﬁcation of R × R is the sphere S 2. But another compactiﬁcation of R × R is the

126
Chapter 6
torus S 1 × S 1. How are these related? By the main property of the one-point compact-
iﬁcation, S 2 is the quotient of S 1 × S 1 by the extra points (1 × S 1) ∪(S 1 × 1). That is,
S 1 ∧S 1  S 2:
T 2  S 1 × S 1
S 2  S 1 ∧S 1
This argument works in general.

Suppose X∗and Y∗are one-point compactiﬁcations of spaces X and Y. Then

where the extra points at inﬁnity are the basepoints.
As a result, suspensions give a simple relationship between S n and S n+1.

Notice that S 1 ∧−and (−)S 1 are both functors from Top∗to Top∗, called the reduced
suspension Σ and the based loop functor Ω, respectively. This gives rise to the suspension-
loop adjunction.
Σ: Top∗
Top∗: Ω
The correspondence Top∗(ΣX, Y)  Top∗(X, ΩY) is understood as follows. Suppose we
have a map f : ΣX →Y, and for any point x ∈X, consider the subspace {x} × I of the
cylinder X × I. After forming the quotient ΣX, this space becomes {x} × S 1, which is then
mapped to Y via f. The assignment sending x to this loop is the adjunct of f. In particular,
f must map the basepoint ∗of ΣX to the basepoint y0 of Y. This gives a map from ∗to
the constant loop at y0. If we further pass to (basepoint-preserving) homotopy classes of

Paths, Loops, Cylinders, Suspensions, . . .
127
morphisms, then we obtain for every pair of pointed spaces X and Y,
[ΣX, Y]

[X, ΩY]
which has important consequences.
Theorem 6.4 Let X be a pointed space. Then πnX  πn−1ΩX for each n ≥1.
Proof. By corollary 6.3.1 and the suspension-loop adjunction,
πnX
=
[S n, X]

[ΣS n−1, X]

[S n−1, ΩX]
=
πn−1ΩX
Since this construction is repeatable, we ﬁnd that πnX ≃π1Ωn−1X. We already know that
the fundamental group of any space is a group, and so we now know that the higher homo-
topy groups are also a group.
Corollary 6.4.1 Let (X, x0) be a pointed space. Then πn(X, x0) is a group for each n ≥1.
In addition, it turns out that πnX is abelian if n ≥2. We’ll hint at the proof in theorem
6.6. Our next goal is to compute the fundamental group of some familiar spaces, starting
with the circle. One would think the circle is a rather benign space, but to compute its
fundamental group, we will use some new machinery—ﬁbrations.
6.6
Fibrations and Based Path Spaces
Often in mathematics, one is interested in organizing similar objects into families. Usually,
this is formalized as follows: one has a “total space” E that maps onto a “base” space B.
The objects being organized into families are the ﬁbers of the map E →B. With this
in mind, let us describe a situation that arises in homotopy theory. We have a map of
topological spaces p: E →B, and there is another space X that lies inside E in some
way—say, g: X →E—and which also lies in the base space B as pg: X →B. Now
suppose X lies within B as the initial part of a homotopy h: X × I →B. In this setup, one
views the copy of X within E as being the ﬁrst step in “lifting” the homotopy from B up to
E. A natural question is: Can we ﬁnish the task? That is, can the rest of the homotopy in
B be lifted to E? If the answer is “yes,” then the map p is called a ﬁbration.

This idea of lifting a homotopy has a dual notion: extending a homotopy. Start with
a homotopy A × I →X, and suppose A sits inside another space Y by way of a map
i: A →Y. It’s natural to wonder if the homotopy extends to Y. In particular, if a map
g: Y  Y × {0} →X already exists and is thought of as the ﬁrst step of an extension, then
one might hope that a full extension exists. If it does, then the map i is called a coﬁbration.
Deﬁnition 6.10 A map p: E →B is called a ﬁbration if and only if for any maps h and
g making the outer square commute, there exists eh: Y →XI so that the whole diagram
commutes:
X
E
X × I
B
g
i
p
h
eh
Here i is the map sending each x ∈X to (x, 0). Often, E is referred to as the total space of
the ﬁbration while B is called the base space of the ﬁbration.

Paths, Loops, Cylinders, Suspensions, . . .
129
Dually, a map i: A →Y is a coﬁbration if for any maps h and g making the outer square
commute, there exists eh: Y →XI so that the whole diagram commutes:
A
XI
Y
X
h
i
e
g
eh
Here the map e is evaluation at 0. It sends a path γ to its starting point γ(0).
These are challenging deﬁnitions. Here’s the takeaway. Fibrations are maps into B with the
property that, if a homotopy in B lifts to the total space at a point, then it lifts completely.
Coﬁbrations are the maps out of space A where, if a homotopy in A extends at a point, then
it extends completely. This follows quickly from a consideration of what commutativity
means in these diagrams:
X
E
X × I
B
g
i
p
h
A
XI

X
h
i

For the left diagram to commute, the map h(−, 0): X × {0} →B, which is hi up to the
isomorphism X  X ×{0} and must be equal to pg, which is to say g is lift of the homotopy
h at the point 0. Now let’s turn to the homotopy extension diagram at the right. Recall the
adjunction Top(A × I, X)  Top(A, XI). So h in the diagram corresponds to a homotopy
A × I →X. And, up to the isomorphism X  X × {0}, the map g between Y →X{0} extends
the homotopy h along i at the point 0.
We’ve referred to ﬁbrations and coﬁbrations as “dual” notions, but know that some care
must be taken to properly dualize concepts in mathematics—there’s usually more going on
under the hood. But here’s the simple idea: (co)ﬁbrations are maps for which (extensions)
lifts exist as soon as we have them for a single point. These ideas respectively are called the
homotopy lifting property and homotopy extension property, and you can generally think
of a (co)ﬁbration as a map with the homotopy (extension) lifting property for all spaces.
We’ll give some examples below, but ﬁrst, it’s good to know that the lifting/extension
properties enjoyed by (co)ﬁbrations are especially potent in a discussion of homotopy the-
ory. From the homotopical viewpoint, any continuous function is either a ﬁbration or a
coﬁbration. Let’s say a few brief words about this.
6.6.1
Mapping Path Space and Mapping Cylinder
Any continuous function factors as a homotopy equivalance followed by a ﬁbration. Du-
ally, any continuous function factors as a coﬁbration followed by a homotopy equivalence.
In other words, any map can be replaced by a ﬁbration or a coﬁbration at will, “up to ho-
motopy.” Even better, this a constructive statement. Given any map f : X →Y, we can

130
Chapter 6
explicitly construct a homotopy equivalance and ﬁbration that realizes this factorization,
and it is similar for coﬁbrations. The homotopy equivalences appearing in these statements
involve two topological spaces associated to f: its mapping path space and its mapping
cylinder.
Deﬁnition 6.11 The mapping path space P f of a map f is the pullback:
Pf
X
PY
Y
⌟
f
In other words, P f consists of pairs (x, γ) ∈X × PY where f x = γ1. Sometimes Pf is also
called the mapping cocylinder.
A nice consequence is that the assignment x 7→(x, cf x) deﬁnes a homotopy equivalence
from X to P f . (Its homotopy inverse is simply projection onto the ﬁrst factor.) And the map
Pf →Y sending the pair (x, γ) to γ1 is a ﬁbration. The idea behind the proof is similar
to that in example 6.1. Then, as claimed, we have a factorization of f as a homotopy
equivalence followed by a ﬁbration:
X
Pf
Y
≃
f
Deﬁnition 6.12 The mapping cylinder Mf of f is the pushout
X
X × I
Y
Mf
f
⌜
where X →X × I is the map x 7→(x, 0). In other words, Mf is the quotient of the disjoint
union of Y and X × I obtained by identifying f x and (x, 0) for each x ∈X. One imagines
Mf as a “cylinder” whose top is a copy of X and whose base is f X, which sits inside Y.
It can be shown that the map X →Mf deﬁned by x 7→[(x, 1)] is a coﬁbration, that Y is
homotopy equivalent to Mf , and that any map f : X →Y factors through this coﬁbration
and equivalence,
X
Mf
Y
f
≃
The fact that any map is, up to homotopy, either a ﬁbration or a coﬁbration composed
with a homotopy equivalence suggests that the triad—ﬁbration, coﬁbration, and homo-
topy equivalence—is intrinsically useful in an exploration of homotopy theory. Indeed, it

131
propels one to the study of model category theory. A model category is a complete and
cocomplete category with three classes of morphisms called ﬁbrations, coﬁbrations, and
weak equivalences that satisfy certain conditions. Or, more succinctly, it’s a category in
which one can “do homotopy theory.” As you might hope, Top with homotopy equiva-
lences and (co)ﬁbrations as given in deﬁnition 6.10 provides a prime example of a model
category (see Strøm (1972)), but it’s not the only model structure on Top, nor is Top the
only category with a model structure. We mention these ideas simply to whet the appetite.
A more categorical discussion of (co)ﬁbrations, equivalences, model categories, and gen-
eral categorical homotopy theory may be found in Riehl (2014).
Let’s now return to the task at hand—examples.
6.6.2
Examples and Results
To give a ﬁrst example of a ﬁbration, we’ll introduce a new mapping space associated to a
pointed space X.
Deﬁnition 6.13 The mapping space PX = Top∗
 (I, 0), (X, x0) is called the based path
space of X.
So points in PX are paths that start at x0 and end at some x ∈X. This space of based paths
is itself a pointed space with the constant path cx0 : I 7→x0 serving as the basepoint.
You’ll have noticed we view the interval I as a pointed space in two ways: either with
basepoint 0 or with basepoint 1. When constructing the reduced cone CX on a pointed
space X as CX = X ∧I, we regard the basepoint of I to be 1. We like our cones to be
right-side up, not upside down. On the other hand, when constructing the based path space
PX on a pointed space X as Top∗(I, X), we regard the basepoint of I to be 0. We like the
basepoint of X to be the beginning—rather than the end—of a path.
But the endpoints of paths are of interest. There is a map p: PX →X which sends
a path γ to its endpoint γ1 ∈X. This map provides a nice connection between PX and
another important mapping space: the ﬁber p−1x0 consisting of all loops at x0. That is,
p−1x0 = ΩX, a situation typically illustrated as a diagram:
ΩX
PX
X
p
There are other ways in which p is a particularly nice kind of map. It sends cx0 to x0, so it
is basepoint preserving. Moreover, it is a ﬁbration.

132
Chapter 6
Example 6.1 For any based space X, the map p: PX →X sending a path γ to its endpoint
γ(1) is a ﬁbration. Suppose we have the commuting square
Z
PX
Z × I
X
g
p
h
where Z is any pointed space. Notice that for a ﬁxed z ∈Z, gz is a path in X ending at
the point h(z, 0), which, with z still ﬁxed, is the starting point of the path hz. So deﬁne
eh: Z × I →PX to be the parameterization of the concatenation hz · gz given by:
eh(z, t)s =

gz(s(1 + t))
if 0 ≤s ≤
1
1+t
h(z, s(1 + t) −1)
if
1
1+t ≤s ≤1.
One can check that eh preserves basepoints and commutes with the diagram.
While on the topic of based path spaces, here is a good property to know about.
Proposition 6.1 PX is contractible.
Proof. Let ∗denote the one-point space. The composition ∗→PX →∗is equal to
id∗, so to prove PX is homotopy equivalent to ∗, we need only show the composition
PX →∗→PX that sends a path γ to cx0 is homotopic to idPX.
Deﬁne h: PX×I →PX by h(γ, t) = γt, where γt : I →X is the path γt(s) = γ s+(1−s)t.
Then h is the identity on PX at t = 0, and h is the constant map γ 7→cγ1 at t = 1. Further,
h is basepoint-preserving since h(cx0, t) = cx0 for all t.
Here is another important example of a ﬁbration.
Example 6.2 The map p from R to S 1 given by y 7→e2πiy is a ﬁbration with ﬁber Z. That
is, if the following diagram commutes
X
R
X × I
S 1
g
p
h
then there is a lift of the homotopy h through p.
The key here is that p is a local homeomorphism: for every y ∈R there is an open
neighborhood of y that maps homeomorphically onto its image—for instance, the interval
(y −1
2, y + 1
2) would work. So there is an open cover U of S 1 so that for each U ∈
U, the inverse image p−1U is a collection of disjoint open sets in R, each of which is
homeomorphic to U. Because h is continuous, its inverse image h−1U is an open cover
of X × I. Further, on each of the compact subspaces {x} × I there is a ﬁnite subcover, say
Vx ⊆h−1U.

Paths, Loops, Cylinders, Suspensions, . . .
133
Lifting h inductively along any one of the Vx isn’t hard. We need two observations.
First, if a lift gx : S →R is deﬁned for a nonempty subset S ⊆h−1U ∈Vx, then gxS is
contained entirely in one of the disjoint homeomorphic copies of U in p−1U—call it US .
Second, p restricts to a homeomorphism pS : US →U. We can thus extend the domain of
such a gx to include all of h−1U by declaring gx := p−1
S h on h−1U. Diagrammatically, we
have:
X
R
...
...
x
X × I
S 1
g
p
h
i
p−1
S h

Inducting through the ﬁnite subcover (using the given g as the base step) we deﬁne for each
x ∈X a lift gx whose domain includes the open cover Vx of {x} × I:
x
R
gx
It’s possible that three or more sets in the cover Vx overlap, in which case there is a choice
of inductions extending g to a gx. However, all such inductions must agree on any overlaps
precisely because p is a local homeomorphism, so the gx are well deﬁned.
This same observation guarantees that any two lifts gx and gx′ must be equal on the
intersection of their domains. Therefore the gx assemble to uniquely determine a map

134

eh: X × I →R such that

commutes. In other words, the exponential map p is a ﬁbration.
These examples give two different ﬁbrations whose base space is the circle.
PS 1
R
S 1
Example 6.1
Example 6.2
Naturally one wonders if this triangle can be completed. Are R and PS 1 related? Yes,
both spaces are contractible, so there is a homotopy equivalence between them. As the
next theorem shows, these ﬁbrations must therefore have homotopy equivalent ﬁbers.
Theorem 6.5 Suppose p and q are ﬁbrations with base space B and f is a map of total
spaces causing the diagram to commute:
E
D
B
f
p
q
If f is a homotopy equivalence, then f induces a homotopy equivalence between ﬁbers.
Commutativity of the triangle implies f p−1b ⊆q−1b for all b ∈B, which is to say that f
is a ﬁber-preserving map. But its homotopy inverse f ′ : D →E may not be ﬁber preserv-
ing, and the homotopies witnessing f f ′ ≃idD and f ′ f ≃idE may not be comprised of
ﬁber-preserving maps. However, if one can replace f ′ with a ﬁber-preserving homotopy
equivalent map g that satisﬁes fg ≃idD and g f ≃idE, where each homotopy is com-
prised of ﬁber-preserving maps, then for each b ∈B the map f can restrict to a homotopy
equivalence between ﬁbers, p−1b ≃q−1b. The theorem thus rests on producing such a
map g.
Proof. By assumption, there is a homotopy h′ from f f ′ to idD. Postcomposing it with the
ﬁbration q gives homotopy h: D × I →B from p f ′ to q, and the outer square commutes
by commutativity of the triangle:
D
E

eh

Paths, Loops, Cylinders, Suspensions, . . .
135
Since p is a ﬁbration, there is a lift eh with eh(−, 0) = f ′. We claim that g := eh(−, 1) is the
desired map. First note that g is ﬁber preserving by commutativity of the previous diagram.
Moreover, fg and idD are homotopic by k: D × I →D deﬁned by
k(d, t) =

feh(d, 1 −2t),
if 0 ≤t ≤1
2
h′(d, 2t −1),
if 1
2 ≤t ≤1
The map k(−, t), however, may not be ﬁber preserving for each t ∈I. To work around
this, one can deﬁne a homotopy M : D × I × I →D from the homotopy qk to a homotopy
between q and itself so that the square commutes:
D × I
D
D × I × I
B
k
q
M
L
Since q is a ﬁbration, M lifts to a homotopy L. Since L ﬁts into the diagram, it provides
the desired ﬁber-preserving homotopy from fg to idD:
fg = k(−, 0) = L(−, 0, 0) ≃L(−, 1, 0) = k(−, 1) = idD
A similar story shows g f ≃idE. Here’s the sketch. First use the ﬁbration p together with
the homotopy witnessing f ′ f ≃idE to get a homotopy E × I →B that ﬁts into the square
E
D
E × I
B
f
q
The lift of the homotopy deﬁnes a map ¯g: E →D. One can then show g¯g ≃idE through
a ﬁber-preserving homotopy, from which it follows that ¯g = idD ¯g ≃fg¯g ≃f and so
g f ≃g¯g ≃idE.
Right away, we obtain several important corollaries.
Corollary 6.5.1 The loop space of the circle ΩS 1 is homotopy equivalent to Z
Proof. Both R →S 1 and PS 1 →S 1 are ﬁbrations by earlier examples. Moreover, both
PS 1 and R are contractible (proposition 6.1 and example 1.21). There is thus a homotopy
equivalence between them that commutes with the ﬁbrations
PS 1
R
S 1

136
Chapter 6
By theorem 6.5 it induces a homotopy equivalence between the ﬁbers ΩS 1 and Z of PS 1 →
S 1 and R →S 1, respectively.
In fact, this idea holds in greater generality.
Corollary 6.5.2 Let p: E →B be a ﬁbration with ﬁber F. If E is contractible, then F is
homotopy equivalent to the loop space ΩB.
Immediately, we obtain the next result.
Corollary 6.5.3 The fundamental group of S 1 is isomorphic to Z.
Proof. By the previous corollary, ΩS 1 ≃Z which implies
π0ΩS 1  π0Z
The left-hand side is π1S 1 by theorem 6.4. The right-hand side is the set of path compo-
nents of Z, which is simply Z.
Now, you might be concerned that π0Z is merely a set with no additional structure since,
after all, the corollary to theorem 6.4 held only in the case when n ≥1. But by the
homotopy invariance of π0, it follows that π0Z is isomorphic to π0ΩS 1 = [S 0, ΩS 1], and
the latter, being a set of (homotopy classes of) maps into a group, is itself a group. So we
are assured that π0Z  Z is indeed a group.
Another important consequence is the following.
Corollary 6.5.4 The nth homotopy group of the circle is trivial for n ≥2.
Proof. If n ≥2, then
πnS 1 = πn−1ΩS 1 = πn−1Z = [S n−1, Z]
The result follows since S n−1 is connected for n > 1 so any basepoint-preserving map from
it to Z must be constant to the basepoint of Z.
While on the topic of nth homotopy groups, here is the result promised earlier.
Theorem 6.6 For any space X the nth homotopy group πnX is abelian for n ≥2.
Proof. The proof is left to exercise 6.4 at the end of the chapter. The picture below gives
a hint when n = 2.

Now that we’ve computed the fundamental group of the circle, we’ll present a few ap-
plications of the result. Afterward, we’ll turn our attention to the fundamental groups of
other familiar spaces. As we’ll see then, a theorem of Seifert and van Kampen provides a
methodical way of doing so.
6.6.3
Applications of π1S 1
The isomorphism π1S 1  Z leads to some nice results, some of which we showcase here.
To start, recall that in section 2.1 we proved that every map from the closed interval [−1, 1]
to itself must have a ﬁxed point. Here is the two-dimensional analog.
Brouwer’s Fixed Point Theorem
Every map D2 →D2 has a ﬁxed point.
Proof. Suppose f : D2 →D2 is a map with no ﬁxed points. Then for any x ∈D2, there is
a unique ray starting at f x and passing through x.
f x
x
rx
Let rx denote the point where this ray intersects the boundary of the disc S 1 = ∂D2, and
observe that r is a continuous map which satisﬁes r(x) = x for all x ∈S 1. Thus ri = idS 1
where i: S 1 ,→D2 is the inclusion. Choosing a basepoint in S 1 and applying π1, we obtain
π1(S 1, 1)
π1(D2, 1)
π1(S 1, 1)
π1i
π1(idS 1) = idπ1(S 1,1)
π1r
But this is impossible since π1D2  0 while π1S 1  Z. Emphatically, the identity does not
factor through the constant map at 0.
The following result from linear algebra is a corollary.
Perron-Frobenius Theorem
Every 3×3 matrix with positive entries has a positive eigen-
value.
Proof. Let ∆2 denote the subset of R3 consisting of all points (x, y, z) satisfying x+y+z = 1,
where each coordinate lies in the interval [0, 1]. That is, ∆2 is the face opposite the origin
of the unit tetrahedron in the ﬁrst quadrant of R3. Now if A is any 3 × 3 matrix with real
positive entries, deﬁne a linear map B by
Bv = 1
λv Av

138
Chapter 6
where λv is the sum of the coordinates of the vector Av. Then B is a linear transformation
from ∆2 to itself. And since ∆2 and the disc D2 are homeomorphic, B must have a ﬁxed
point. Thus there is a vector w so that w = Bw and so Aw = λww where, by assumption,
λw must be positive.
We have two more applications of π1S 1 to share. Both require the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 6.14 Let f : (S 1, 1) →(S 1, f1). Choose a path f1 →1, which deﬁnes an
isomorphism π1(S 1, f1) ≃π1(S 1, 1). Then π1 f sends a generator [γ] ∈π1(S 1, 1) to an
integer multiple of [γ]. This integer, denoted deg f, is called the degree of f.
A check is required to make sure that deg f does not depend on the choice of path, which
follows from the fact that π1(S 1, 1) is abelian. Also, notice that deg f only depends on the
homotopy class of f since π1 f and π1g are equal as group homomorphisms whenever f
and g are homotopy equivalent maps.
Example 6.3 The degree of the identity map on S 1 is 1. The degree of the map sending z
to iz is also 1 since rotation by 90◦is homotopic to the identity map. And for any n ≥1,
the degree of the map z 7→zn is n.
Theorem 6.7 If f : S 1 →S 1 has degree n , 1, then f has a ﬁxed point.
Proof. If f does not have a ﬁxed point, deﬁne h: S 1 × I →S 1 by
h(x, t) = (1 −t)f x + tx
|(1 −t)f x + tx|
Then h gives a homotopy between f and idS 1 and so deg f = 1.
The notion of degree provides yet another application of π1S 1  Z.
The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
Every polynomial
pz = zn + cn−1zn−1 + · · · + c0
with ci ∈C and n , 0 has a root in C.
Proof. Let n , 0, and suppose f does not have a root. Then
h(z, t) = p(tz)
|p(tz)|
deﬁnes a homotopy between
p
|p| and
c
|c|, the latter being the constant map at c0. Thus
p
|p|
must have degree 0. On the other hand,
i(z, t) =
tnp( z
t )
|p( z
t )|

Paths, Loops, Cylinders, Suspensions, . . .
139
deﬁnes a homotopy between p
|p| and the map z 7→zn which has degree n. Thus 0 = deg p
|p| =
n, which is a contradiction.
With π1S 1 in hand, let’s now turn to compute the fundamental group of other spaces. A
result of Seifert and van Kampen gives us a tool for doing so.
6.7
The Seifert van Kampen Theorem
There is a common strategy employed in mathematics, which we mentioned early on in
section 2.1: information about parts and how they interact is often used to obtain informa-
tion about a whole. This is especially true in topology, where (as we’ve seen) spaces are
oftentimes decomposed into open sets and information about those sets and their intersec-
tion is used to obtain information about the space. This approach is particularly valuable
when computing fundamental groupoids (and fundamental groups). If a space X can be
decomposed as the union of open sets U and V and if the fundamental groupoids of U, V
and U ∩V are known, then we can expect to understand something about the fundamental
groupoid of X. As the next theorem shows, it can be understood completely—it is a colimit
involving the fundamental groupoids of the spaces comprising X.
Seifert van Kampen Theorem
Suppose U and V are open subsets of a topological space
X = U ∪V. Then one has the following diagram of spaces and continuous functions:
U ∩V
U
V
X
Applying π1 yields a pushout diagram in the category of groupoids.
π1(U ∩V)
π1U
π1V
π1X
⌜
Proof. Here is the idea of the proof. If G is any groupoid ﬁtting into a diagram as on the
left,
π1(U ∩V)
π1U
π1V
G
f
g
π1(U ∩V)
π1U
π1V
π1X
G
f
g
Φ

140
Chapter 6
then we must construct a functor Φ completing the diagram as on the right. On objects,
this is straightforward. Let x ∈X. If x ∈U, deﬁne Φx = f x, and if x ∈V, deﬁne Φx = gx.
If x ∈U ∩V, these two assignments agree.
To deﬁne Φ on a homotopy class of paths from x →y, choose a representative path
γ: I →X, and use compactness of I to subdivide the path γ into a composition of paths
γn · · · γ1, each component of which lies in either U or V. Then, deﬁne Φ([γ]) to be the
composition of (f or g)[γn] · · · (f or g)[γ2](f or g)[γ1] as the case may be. To see that Φ[γ]
is well deﬁned, let γ′ ≃γ, and choose a homotopy h between γ and γ′. Use compactness
of I × I to subdivide the image of h into rectangles that lie entirely in U or V. The details
are left as an exercise.
The next result is an important consequence.
Proposition 6.2 Suppose U and V are open subsets of a topological space X = U ∪V,
and suppose x0 ∈U ∩V. Then one has the following diagram of spaces and continuous
functions:
U ∩V
U
V
X
If U ∩V is path connected, then the following diagram is a pushout in the category of
groups.
π1(U ∩V, x0)
π1(U, x0)
π1(V, x0)
π1(X, x0)
⌜
Proof. By the general remark following the deﬁnition of the fundamental group, the fun-
damental groups are equivalent as categories to the fundamental groupoids since U ∩V is
path connected.
To see why U ∩V must be path connected, consider the circle X = S 1, and let U and V be
the subsets as indicated.
U
V

Paths, Loops, Cylinders, Suspensions, . . .
141
Then U∩V is homotopy equivalent to a two-point space and U and V are both contractible.
Assuming Seifert van Kampen gives a supposed pushout of groups,
1
1
1
π1(S 1, 1)
⌜
But the pushout of the diagram 1 ←1 →1 is the trivial group 1, and thus 1  π1(S 1, 1) 
Z, which is of course a contradiction.
Now you might be wondering, “What exactly are pushouts in the category Grp?” The
coproduct of two groups G and H is their free product G ∗H, the group generated by the
generators of both G and H with relations (equations satisﬁed by the generators) coming
from the relations in G and H. The pushout, then, of a diagram of groups H ←K →G is
a quotient of the free product such that the diagram commutes:
K
G
H
(G ∗H)/N
f
g
One concludes that N must be the (smallest) normal subgroup of G ∗H generated by the
relations fk = gk for each k ∈K. This construction is sometimes called the amalgamated
free product.
6.7.1
Examples
Let’s close by using the Seifert van Kampen theorem to compute the fundamental group of
some familiar spaces.
Example 6.4 Suppose X = S 2 is the sphere. Let U be all of S 2 except for the point
(0, 0, 1), and let V be all of S 2 except for (0, 0, −1). Then U ∩V is homotopy equivalent to
a circle, and thus its fundamental group is isomorphic to Z. And since both U and V are
contractible we obtain the diagram of groups
Z
1
1
π1(S 2, 1)
The fundamental group of S 2 is then trivial.

142
Chapter 6
Example 6.5 Consider the wedge product of two circles S 1 ∨S 1, a “ﬁgure eight.” Let U
and V be the indicated subspaces.
U
V
Notice that U ∩V is contractible while U and V are each homotopy equivalent to a
circle. Thus, the fundamental group of each is isomorphic to Z. This is isomorphic to the
free group on a single generator, so let’s write π1U  Fα and π1V  Fβ where α and β are
the loops generating π1U and π1V, respectively. Then we have the diagram:
1
Fα
Fβ
π1(S 1 ∨S 1, s0)
The fundamental group of S 1 ∨S 1 is therefore the free group on two generators, Fα∗Fβ 
F(α, β).
Example 6.6 Recall from example 1.17 that we can view the torus T as the quotient of a
square with opposite sides identiﬁed:
All four corners of the square are identiﬁed to a single point, say, t0. So let’s consider the
pointed torus (T, t0). Now suppose p is any other point in T. Set V = T ∖{p}, and let U be
a “small” disc containing both p and t0. Naming the two edges α and β, we have a situation
like this:
p
U
β
α
t0
Then U is contractible. Further, V retracts onto the wedge of the loops α and β. To see this,
think of removing the point p and retract the remaining gray area onto the boundary of the
square. Keeping in mind that opposite sides are identiﬁed, one obtains the wedge product
of the loops (α, t0) and (β, t0), namely, (S 1 ∨S 1, t0). Hence, by example 6.5, π1(V, t0) is

Paths, Loops, Cylinders, Suspensions, . . .
143
given by the free product on two generators which we may as well call α and β. Finally,
the intersection of U and V is a punctured disc: U ∖{p} which retracts onto the inner
“lollipop” below
γ
β
α
t0
whose fundamental group is given by the free group generated by the loop γ moving from
t0 out along the diagonal, counterclockwise around the circle, and back down the diagonal
to t0. Therefore, by Seifert van Kampen,
Fγ
1
F(α, β)
π1(T, t0)
But under the inclusion U ∩V →V, the loop γ is sent to itself. And under the retraction of
V onto the boundary of the square, γ maps to αβα−1β−1; that is, the group homomorphism
Fγ →F(α, β) sends γ to αβα−1β−1. Therefore π1(T, t0) is the quotient of F(α, β) generated
by the relation αβα−1β−1 = 1. This group is isomorphic to Z × Z.
This example shows that π1(S 1 × S 1)  π1S 1 × π1S 1, which isn’t too surprising. As the
categorically minded reader can check, the functor π1 takes products to products.
Example 6.7 Referring again to example 1.17, recall that the Klein bottle K is obtained
by identifying opposite sides of a square as shown.
We can compute its fundamental group in the same way as for the torus. Let k0 be the
single vertex of the square, and let p be another point in K. If U is an open disc containing
p and V = K ∖{p}, then by the same arguments as in the previous example, we have the
following setup

π1(K, k0)
by Seifert van Kampen. The conclusion is that π1(K, k0) is isomorphic to a group with a
presentation given in two generators and one relation, namely, ⟨α, β | αβαβ−1⟩.
But before too heartily congratulating ourselves on the calculation, recall that deciding
whether a given group presentation describes the trivial group or not can’t algorithmically
be determined (Wikipedia, 2019). This is a variant of the word problem and is indeed
equivalent to the halting problem in computing. Some wariness in working with group
presentations is in order.
