Introduction
A market is the combined behaviour of thousands of people
responding to information, misinformation and whim.
Kenneth Chang
Resolving issues like ‘‘how and why markets work? … and work well?’’1 are often
concerns of the so-called mainstream economists. The query dates back to Adam
Smith who conjectured a self-regulating economic system that heads towards a
stable equilibrium, as individual economic agents pursue their divergent, often
conﬂicting self-interest. No vulnerabilities on the part of the market were feared,
the markets were supposed to be ‘‘fundamentally stable’’. The illusion continued to
impinge on ideas of other noted economists of the day such as Ricardo, Say,
Marshal, and Walrus. Out of this evolved a related chimera: in a fundamentally
stable market, asset prices truly reﬂect fundamentals and are fairly priced. The
optimistic belief was too strong to be uprooted even by the great depression of the
1930s. The post-war economic theory saw a resurgence of the idea of rationality
and efﬁciency of the market: ‘‘they breathed new life into the old fallacy’’.2
One of the most celebrated post-war economics theories is the efﬁcient market
hypothesis (Fama 1970). The theory propagated the ‘fact’ that it may be possible
to beat some of the markets all the time and all the markets some of the times but it
would be impossible to beat all the markets all the time. The efﬁcient market
hypothesis tells that it would be impossible to make consistent proﬁt from any
asset market. The market is able to process new information instantaneously and
this is reﬂected properly in the asset price. In a stock market, where numerous
proﬁt motivated investors are playing with similar objectives, where each of them
prefers a stock with high return than a stock with low return and a stock with low
risk to a stock with high risk, with no insider knowledge available to anyone (at
least legally), each investor can expect to earn only a fair return for the risks
undertaken (Hagin 1979). According to Cootner (1964), ‘‘If any substantial group
of buyers thought prices were too low, their buying would force up the prices. The
reverse would be true for sellers. Except for appreciation due to earnings retention,
the conditional expectation of tomorrow’s price, given today’s price, is today’s
price. In such a world, the only price changes that would occur are those that result

from new information. Since there is no reason to expect that information to be
non-random in appearance, the period-to-period price changes of a stock should be
random movements, statistically independent of one another’’.
The efﬁcient market hypothesis has been challenged time and again on various
grounds. One of the most potent of these is on the basis of consistently proﬁtable
trading strategies. According to the efﬁcient market hypothesis, the performance of
portfolios of stocks should be independent of past returns (Hon and Tonks 2003).
However, empirical studies have shown that stock prices are not actually inde-
pendent of past returns. They exhibit positive autocorrelation for a very long time
which decays slowly. Momentum trading is one of the trading strategies which
bank on this autocorrelation and buy and sell accordingly to make consistent
proﬁts. Since its discovery by DeBondt and Thaler (1985), the beneﬁts of
momentum strategies have been documented in many markets. Momentum trad-
ing, in simple words, means buying stocks which exhibit past overperformance.3
Momentum trading is built on the rule that stocks which have been performing
well, more precisely, better than the market for a predeﬁned historical period, will
tend to perform strongly in the coming periods as well. It has been shown that
these momentum stocks outperform the market signiﬁcantly in future periods as
well. As Vanstone (2010) puts aptly, with momentum trading strategies, the
investors hitch a ride on the stronger stocks. The efﬁcient market hypothesis, is
however unable to explain this phenomenon. Fama himself referred this as ‘‘the
premier unexplained anomaly’’. The proponents of efﬁcient market theory con-
tinue to call momentum trading a result of irrational investor behavior or ‘‘psy-
chological biases’’ (Abreu and Brunnermeier 2003). The study of momentum in a
particular asset market is of utmost importance, as in extreme cases, it may cause
herding, bubble, and subsequent crash4 (Vayanos and Wooley 2009). A possible
reason for existence of momentum in the stock market is that the market is at most
semi-strong efﬁcient and exhibits a certain degree of long-term memory, i.e., once
a shock is propagated into the system, it does not die down instantly as proposed
by the efﬁcient market theory, but decays slowly. Thus, the presence of momentum
trading and the resultant denial of efﬁcient market hypothesis have implications for
ﬁnancial market theories as well as for government policies. And, the area has
emerged as the ﬁnancial market analysts’ delight.
This study is an exploration of the Indian stock market for the possible presence
of momentum trading. One thing, however, is to be noted. While it is true that
momentum trading, generating speculative bubble may bring in its train a ﬁnancial
market crash, its nature on the other hand might depend on the nature of the
economy itself. The study, while exploring the presence and nature of momentum
trading in the Indian stock market in recent years tries to relate it to the signiﬁcant
structural breaks in the Indian or global economy. To be precise, it tries to relate
the instability in the stock market possibly to the speculative trading in the market:

Introduction

whether it is human psychology that drives ﬁnancial markets. In that process, the
choice of a signiﬁcant structural break has been obvious: the global ﬁnancial melt-
down of 2007–2008—a crisis that has often been referred to as the worst ﬁnancial
crisis ever since the one related to the great depression of 1929.
While analyzing the nature of momentum trading in the Indian stock market
around the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–2008, the study takes into account two major
representatives of the market, Bombay stock index (BSE) and National stock index
(NSE), over the period 2005–2012. This study seeks to answer a few important
questions. First of all, it tries to unveil the underlying structure of the market. In
that process, it examines the following issues:
• What has been the latent structure in the Indian stock market around the crisis of
2007–2008? Does the structure hint scope for designing a proﬁtable trading
strategy?
• Is it possible to construct a proﬁtable portfolio in the Indian stock market?
• Is there any proﬁtable trading strategy in the Indian stock market?
While exploring these issues, the study delves deeper and breaks the whole
period into two sub-periods, before the crisis of 2008 and after the crisis of 2008.
The rationale beneath this segregation is to see whether there has been any dis-
cernible change in the market structure before and after the shock.
There have been some studies that have explored some of these issues albeit in
an isolated manner. An empirical analysis in the Indian context addressing all such
issues, particularly in the context of recent ﬁnancial meltdowns, is however, lacking
in the ﬁeld. The present study is a comprehensive, analytical study (instead of being
theoretical only) on momentum trading, thus trying to ﬁll the void in the literature.
After this introductory chapter, the trajectory of the study will be as follows:
Chapter 2 explores the latent structure in the Indian stock market, along with its
sectors, around the ﬁnancial crisis. To understand the market structure, the study
makes use of exploratory factor analysis. It also tracks the factor scores along with
the cycles in the respective indexes to scrutinize the underlying market behavior.
Speciﬁcally, the chapter seeks to address the following issues:
• How the market has behaved over the period of study? Has there been any latent
structure in the market?
• What are the trends at sectoral level? Are they similar, or otherwise, to the
market trends?
• Are the trends independent of the selection of the stock market exchanges?
• Whether and how ﬁnancial crisis could affect the market trends? The rationale
beneath such analyses is to see whether there has been any discernible change in
the market structure before and after the shock. A clear behavioral pattern would
hint towards an inefﬁcient market and possible scope for designing proﬁtable
portfolio mix.
Chapter 3 tries to ﬁnd an optimal portfolio mix in the Indian stock market. It
considers different parameters like risk, return, risk-adjusted return, and market
risk to construct portfolios at market and sectoral levels. It then considers whether
1

the choice of the portfolio is independent of the selection of the stock market
exchanges and can avoid the cycles of the economy.
Chapter 4 deals with momentum trading and possibility of a proﬁtable trading
strategy in the Indian stock market. It does so by examining the historical moving
averages of the indexes. According to the trading rule an investor should buy when
price is above some moving average of historical prices and sell when price falls
below some moving average. The study will consider several moving averages,
short run, medium run, and long run, and will see whether the general buy and sell
strategies fare better than the holding strategy based on the moving average.
Existence of a momentum strategy would reafﬁrm the doubt that the Indian stock
market is not efﬁcient. It will put a question mark to the invincibility of the market,
as suggested by the efﬁcient market hypothesis.
The study concludes by pointing towards the implications of the ﬁndings at
investment and policy level.

Trends in Indian Stock Market: Scope
for Designing Proﬁtable Trading Rule?
Abstract This chapter explores the latent structure in the Indian stock market,
along with its sectors, around the ﬁnancial crisis. To understand the market
structure, the study makes use of exploratory factor analysis. It also tracks the
factor scores along with the cycles in the respective indexes to scrutinize the
underlying market behavior. Apart from looking for the latent structure, the
chapter seeks to explore the following issues: How the market has behaved over
the period of study? What are the trends at sectoral level? Are they similar, or
otherwise to the market trends? Are the trends independent of the selection of the
stock market exchanges and whether, and how ﬁnancial crisis could affect such
trends? The rationale behind such analyses is to see whether there has been any
discernible change in the market structure before and after the shock. A clear
behavioral pattern would hint toward an inefﬁcient market and possible scope for
designing proﬁtable portfolio mix.

2.1 Introduction
The presence of momentum trading and the resultant trial put on the efﬁcient
market hypothesis have attracted the attention of ﬁnancial analysts and researchers.
Momentum trading is a result of irrational investor behavior or ‘‘psychological
biases’’ or ‘‘biased self-attribution’’, and may lead to, in extreme cases, herd
behavior, formation of bubble, and subsequent panic and crashes in ﬁnancial
market. The speculative bubble generated by momentum trading inﬂate, becomes

‘self-fulﬁlling’ until they eventually burst with their far-reaching, ruinous impact
on real economy. The crash is usually followed by an irrational, negative bubble.
Momentum trading thus leads to irrational movement in prices in both directions
and its presence is a serious attack on the myth that a capitalist system is self-
regulating heading toward a stable equilibrium. Rather, as noted by Shiller and
others, it is an unstable system susceptible to ‘‘irrational exuberance’’ and ‘‘irra-
tional pessimism’’.
Ours is a study that explores the possible presence of momentum trading in the
Indian stock market in recent years, particularly in light of the recent global ﬁnancial
melt-down of 2007–2008. Given the close connection between ﬁnancial melt-down
and speculative trading, the relevance of the study is obvious. The study starts with
an exploration of the trend and latent structure in the Indian stock market around the
crisis and eventually tries to relate the instability to the speculative trading.
2.2 Trends and Latent Structure in Indian Stock Market
While analyzing the trends in the Indian stock market around the ﬁnancial crisis of
2007–2008, the study uses some benchmark stock market indexes along with
different sectoral indexes. The Bombay stock exchange (BSE) and the National
stock exchange (NSE) are the two oldest and largest stock market exchanges in
India and hence, could be taken as representatives of the Indian stock market. The
study analyzes the trends, their similarities and dissimilarities, in the two
exchanges to get a complete description of Indian stock market movements. While
analyzing the market trends the study concentrates on the following:
How the market has behaved over the period of study. Has there been any latent
structure in the market?
What are the trends at sectoral level? Are they similar, or otherwise, to the market
trends?
Are the trends independent of the selection of the stock market exchanges?
Whether and how ﬁnancial crisis could affect the market trends?
Before we go into the detailed analysis let us brieﬂy report on the market index and
the sectoral indexes that the study picks up from the two exchanges.The study uses
daily price data for all the market and sectoral indexes for the period ranging from
January 2005 to September 2012. The price data are then used to calculate daily
return series using the formula Rt = ln(Pt/Pt-1), where Pt is the price on the t’th day.
2.2.1 The Market and the Sectors: Bombay Stock Exchange
The study considers BSE SENSEX or BSE Sensitive Index or BSE 30 as the
market index from BSE. BSE SENSEX, which started in January 1986 is a value-
6
2
Trends in Indian Stock Market: Scope for Designing Proﬁtable Trading Rule?

weighted index composed of 30 largest and most actively traded stocks in BSE.
The SENSEX is regarded as the pulse of the domestic stock markets in India.
These companies account for around 50 % of the market capitalization of the BSE.
The base value of the SENSEX is 100 on April 1, 1979, and the base year of BSE-
SENSEX is 1978–1979. Initially, the index was calculated on the ‘full market
capitalization’ method. However, it has switched to the free ﬂoat method since
September 2003. The stocks represent different sectors such as, housing related,
capital goods, telecom, diversiﬁed, ﬁnance, transport equipment, metal, metal
products and mining, FMCG, information technology, power, oil and gas, and
healthcare.
As far as the sectoral indexes are concerned, we select 11 market capitalization
weighted sectoral indexes introduced by BSE in 1999. These are BSE AUTO, BSE
BANKEX, BSE CD, BSE CG, BSE FMCG, BSE IT, BSE HC, BSE PSU, BSE
METAL, BSE ONG, and BSE POWER. Of these indexes, only BANKEX has its
base year in 2000. All the others have base year in 1999 with base value of 100 in
February 1999. The indexes represent different sectors in the Indian economy
namely, automobile, banking, consumer durables, capital goods, fast moving
consumer goods, information technology, healthcare, public sector unit, metal, oil
and gas, and power, respectively.
2.2.2 The Market and the Sectors: National Stock Exchange
The NSE is the stock exchange located at Mumbai, India. In terms of market
capitalization, it is the 11th largest index in the world. By daily turnover and
number of trades, for both equities and derivative trading it is the largest index in
India. NSE has a market capitalization of around US$1 trillion and over 1,652
listings as of July 2012. NSE is mutually owned by a set of leading ﬁnancial
institutions, banks, insurance companies, and other ﬁnancial intermediaries in
India but its ownership and management operate as separate entities. In 2011, NSE
was the third largest stock exchange in the world in terms of the number of
contracts traded in equity derivatives. It is the second fastest growing stock
exchange in the world with a recorded growth of 16.6 %. As far as the sectoral
indexes are concerned, we select some market capitalization weighted sectoral
indexes introduced by NSE. These are CNX BANK, CNX COMMO, CNX
ENERGY, CNX FINANCE, CNX FMCG, CNX IT, CNX METALS, CNX MNC,
CNX PHARMA, CNX PSU BANK, CNX PSE, CNX INFRA, and CNX SER-
VICES. The indexes represent different sectors in the Indian economy namely
Bank, Consumptions sector, Energy, Finance, FMCG, IT, Metal, MNC, Pharma-
ceutical, Public Sector Unit, Infrastructure, and Services.
The study is conducted and market trends are analyzed over three phases in the
Indian stock market:
2.2
Trends and Latent Structure in Indian Stock Market

1. The entire period: 2005 January to 2012 September. The trends obtained for
this entire period could be taken as the ‘average’ market trend.
2. The prologue of crisis: 2005 January to 2008 January.
3. The aftermath of crisis: 2008 February to 2012 September.
The phases are constructed using the methods of detecting a structural break in
a ﬁnancial time series. Any ﬁnancial crisis could well be thought of as a switch in
regime that is often reﬂected in a structural break in the market volatility. In that
way, a ﬁnancial crisis could possibly be associated with a volatility break or
regime switches that might lead to ﬁnancial crises. While identifying volatility
breaks, we use the same methodology, introduced originally by Inclan and Tiao
(1994), and used in our earlier studies (2011, 2012). We recapitulate the meth-
odology brieﬂy in the following sections.
2.3 Detection of Structural Break in Volatility
The parameters of a typical time series do not remain constant over time. It makes
paradigm shifts in regular intervals. The time of this shift is the structural break
and the period between two breakpoints is known as a regime. There have been
several studies aimed at measuring the breakpoints. As usual, a majority of them
are in the stock market. As only the algorithm used to detect the breakpoints is
important rather than the underlying time series, the following section discusses
those studies with important breakthroughs in the algorithm.
The ﬁrst group of studies was able to detect only one unknown structural
breakpoint. Perron (1990, 1997a), Hansen (1990, 1992), Banerjee et al. (1992),
Perron and Vogelsang (1992), Chu and White (1992), Andrews (1993), Andrews
and Ploberger (1994), Gregory and Hansen (1996), did some major works in this
area. Studies by Nelson and Plosser (1982), Perron (1989), Zivot and Andrews
(1992) tested unit root in presence of structural break. Bai (1994, 1997) considered
the distributional properties of the break dates.
The second group of studies was an improvement over the ﬁrst as it was able to
detect multiple structural breaks in a ﬁnancial time series, most importantly
endogenous breakpoints. Signiﬁcant contributions were made by Zivot and Andrews
(1992). Perron (1989, 1997b), Bai and Perron (2003), Lumsdaine and Papell (1997)
tests for unit root allowing for two breaks in the trend function. Hansen (2001)
considers multiple breaks, although he considers the breaks to be exogenously given.
The major breakthrough was the study by Inclan and Tiao (1994), who pro-
posed a test to detect shifts in unconditional variance, that is, the volatility. This
test is used extensively in ﬁnancial time series to identify breaks in volatility
(Wilson et al. 1996; Aggarwal et al. 1999; Huang and Yang 2001). This test was
later modiﬁed by (Sansó et al. 2004) to account for conditional variance as well.
Hsu et al. (1974) proposed in their study a model with non-stationary variance
which is subjected to changes. This is probably the ﬁrst work involving structural
8
2
Trends in Indian Stock Market: Scope for Designing Proﬁtable Trading Rule?

breaks in variance. Hsu’s later works in 1977, 1979, and 1982 were aimed at
detecting a single break in variance in a time series. Abraham and Wei (1984)
discussed methods of identifying a single structural shift in variance. An
improvement came in the study of Baufays and Rasson (1985) who addressed the
issue with multiple breakpoints in their paper. Tsay (1988) also discussed ARMA
models allowing for outliers and variance changes and proposed a method for
detecting the breakpoint in variance. More recently, Cheng (2009) provided an
algorithm to detect multiple structural breakpoints for a change in mean as well as
a change in variance.
This study does not explicitly incorporate any regime switching model but
considers the period between two breaks as a regime. Schaller and Norden (1997)
used Markov Switching model to ﬁnd very strong evidence of regime switch in
CRSP value-weighted monthly stock market returns from 1929 to 1989. Marcucci
(2005) used a regime switching GARCH model to forecast volatility in S&P500
which is characterized by several regime switches. Structural breaks and regime
switch is addressed by Ismail and Isa (2006) who used a SETAR-type model to test
structural breaks in Malaysian Ringgit, Singapore Dollar, and Thai Baht.
Theoretically, volatility break dates are structural breaks in variance of a given
time series. Structural breaks are often deﬁned as persistent and pronounced
macroeconomic shifts in the data generating process. Usually, the probability of
observing any structural break increases as we expand the period of study. The
methodology used in this chapter is the line of analysis followed by Inclan and
Tiao (1994). In the following section, we brieﬂy recapitulate the methodology.
We may start from a simple AR(1) process as that described in (2.1)
yt ¼ a þ qyt1 þ et
Ee2
t ¼ r2
ð2:1Þ
Here et is a time series of serially uncorrelated shocks. If the series is stationary,
the parameters a; q and r2 are constant over time. By deﬁnition, a structural break
occurs if at least one of the parameters changes permanently at some point in time
(Hansen 2001). The time point where the parameter changes value is often termed
as a ‘‘break date’’. According to Brooks (2002), structural breaks are irreversible in
nature. The reasons behind occurrence of structural breaks, however, are not very
speciﬁed. Economic and non-economic (or even unidentiﬁable) reasons are
equally likely to bring about structural break in volatility. (Valentinyi-Endrész
2004).
2.3.1 Detection of Multiple Structural Breaks in Variance:
The ICSS Test
The Iterative Cumulative Sum of Squares (or the ICSS) algorithm by Inclan and
Tiao (1994) can very well detect sudden changes in unconditional variance for a

stochastic process. Hence, the test is often used to detect multiple shifts in vola-
tility. The algorithm starts from the premise that over an initial period, the time
series under consideration displays a stationary variance. The variance changes
following a shock to the system and continues to be stationary till it experiences
another shock in the future. This process is repeated over time till we identify all
the breaks. Structural breaks can effectively capture regime switches (Altissimo
and Corradi 2003; Gonzalo and Pitarakis 2002; Valentinyi-Endrész 2004). The
different tests for identifying volatility breaks isolate dates where conditional
volatility moves from one stationary level to another. The idea is similar to those
lying behind the Markov regime switching models, where a system jumps from
one volatility regime to another.
2.3.1.1 The Original Model: Breaks in Unconditional Variance
The original model of Inclan and Tiao (1994) are reproduced as follows:

independent observations at

each interval, the variance is s2

The centralized or normalized cumulative sum of squares is denoted by Dk
where
Dk ¼ Ck

ð2:3Þ
CT is the sum of squared residuals for the whole sample period.
If there is no volatility shift Dk will oscillate around zero. With a change in
variance, it will drift upward or downward and will exhibit a pattern going out of
some speciﬁed boundaries (provided by a critical value based on the distribution of
Dk) with high probability. If at some k, say k*, the maximum absolute value of Dk,

For multiple breakpoints, however, the usefulness of the Dk function is ques-
tionable due to ‘‘masking effect’’. To avoid this, Inclan and Tiao designed an

iterative algorithm that uses successive application of the Dk function at different
points in the time series to look for possible shift in volatility.
2.3.1.2 Modiﬁed ICSS Test: Breaks in Conditional Variance
The modiﬁed ICSS test is reproduced and used in this study. Sansó et al. (1994)
found signiﬁcant size distortions for the ICSS test in presence of excessive kurtosis
and conditional heteroscedasticity. This makes original ICSS test invalid in the
context of ﬁnancial time series that are often characterized by fat tails and con-
ditional heteroscedasticity. As a remedial measure, they introduced two tests to
explicitly consider the fourth moment properties of the disturbances and the
conditional heteroscedasticity.
The ﬁrst test, or the k1 test, makes the asymptotic distribution free of nuisance
parameters for iid zero mean random variables.

The use of the above-mentioned tests on our data set identiﬁes the sub-phases
mentioned earlier. One point, however, is to be noted while considering these sub-
phases. The period of aftermath might be found to be characterized by further
ﬂuctuations in the Indian stock market, some of which might even be capable of
generating further ﬁnancial market crisis. However, analysts often consider it too
early to call this period another era of ﬁnancial crisis. This period of ﬁnancial
turmoil and vulnerability should be better treated as aftershocks of the crisis of
2007–2008 than altogether a new eon of crisis. Moreover, the ﬂuctuations in recent
years are yet to be comparable to the older ones in terms of their overall

devastating impact on the real economy. Our study hence is built particularly
around the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–2008. And hence, the crisis period and its
aftermath are exclusively in terms of this ﬁnancial crisis.
2.4 Identifying Trends in Indian Stock Market:
The Methodology
The latent structure in the market could be best analyzed by using an exploratory
factor analysis (EFA). EFA is a simple, nonparametric method for extracting
relevant information from large correlated data sets (Hair et al. 2010). It could
reduce a complex data set to a lower dimension to reveal the sometimes hidden,
simpliﬁed structures that often underlie it. In EFA, each variable (Xi) is expressed
as a linear combination of underlying factors (Fi). The amount of variance each
variable shares with others is called communality. The covariance among variables
is described by common factors and a unique factor (Ui) for each variable. Hence,
Xi ¼ Ai1F1 þ    þ AimFm þ ViUi
ð2:7Þ
and Fi ¼ Wi1X1 þ    þ WikXk
ð2:8Þ
where, Ai1is the standardized multiple regression coefﬁcient of variable i on factor
j; Vi is the standardized regression coefﬁcient of variable i on unique factor i; m is
the number of common factors; Wi’s are the factor scores, and k is the number of
variables. The unique factors are uncorrelated with each other and with common
factors.
The appropriateness of using EFA on a data set could be judged by Bartlett’s
test of sphericity and the Kaiser-Meyar-Olkin (KMO) measure. The Bartlett’s test
of sphericity tests the null of population correlation matrix to be an identity matrix.
A statistically signiﬁcant Bartlett statistic indicates the extent of correlation among
variables to be sufﬁcient to use EFA. Moreover, KMO measure of sampling
adequacy should exceed 0.50 for appropriateness of EFA.
In factor analysis, the variables are grouped according to their correlation so
that variables under a particular factor are strongly correlated with each other.
When variables are correlated they will share variances among them. A variable’s
communality is the estimate of its shared variance among the variables represented
by a speciﬁc factor.
Through appropriate methods, factor scores could be selected so that the ﬁrst
factor explains the largest portion of the total variance. Then a second set,
uncorrelated to the ﬁrst, could be found so that the second factor accounts for most
of the residual variance and so on. This chapter uses the Principal Component
method where the total variance in data is considered. The method helps when we
isolate minimum number of factors accounting for maximum variance in data.
12

Factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 are retained. An eigenvalue represents
the amount of variance associated with the factor. Factors with eigenvalues less
than one are not better than a single variable, because after standardization, each
variable has a variance of 1.0.
Interpretation of factors will require an examination of the factor loadings. A
factor loading is the correlation of the variable and the factor. Hence, the squared
loading is the variable’s total variance accounted by the factor. Thus, a 0.50
loading implies that 25 % of the variance of the variable is explained by the factor.
Usually, factor loadings in the range of ±0.30 to ±0.40 are minimally required for
interpretation of a structure. Loadings greater than or equal to ±0.50 are practi-
cally signiﬁcant while loadings greater than or equal to ±0.70 imply presence of
well-deﬁned structures.
The initial or unrotated factor matrix, however, shows the relationship between
the factors and the variables where factor solutions extract factors in the order of
their variance extracted. The ﬁrst factor accounting for the largest amount of
variance in the data is a general factor where almost every variable has signiﬁcant
loading. The subsequent factors are based on the residual amount of variance. Such
factors are difﬁcult to interpret as a single factor could be related to many vari-
ables. Factor rotation provides simpler factor structures that are easier to interpret.
With rotation, the reference axes of the factors are rotated about the origin, until
some other positions are reached. With factor rotation, variance is re-distributed
from the earlier factor to the latter. Effectively, one factor will be signiﬁcantly
correlated with only a few variables and a single variable will have high and
signiﬁcant loading with only one factor. In an orthogonal factor rotation, as the
axes are maintained at angles of 90, the resultant factors will be uncorrelated to
each other. Within the orthogonal factor rotation methods, VARIMAX is the most
popular method where the sum of variances of the required loading of the factor
matrix is maximized. There are, however, oblique factor rotations where the ref-
erence axes are not maintained at 90 angles. The resulting factors will not be
totally uncorrelated to each other. This chapter will use that method of factor
rotation which will ﬁt the data best.
The study then employs Cronbach’s alpha as a measure of internal consistency.
In theory a high value of alpha is often used as evidence that the items measure an
underlying (or latent) construct. Cronbach’s alpha, however, is not a statistical test.
It is a coefﬁcient of reliability or consistency.
The standardized Cronbach’s alpha could be written as: a ¼
N:c
vþ N1
ð
Þ:c
Here N is the number of items (here markets); c is the average inter-item
covariance among the items and v is the average variance. From the formula, it is
clear that an increase in the number of items increases Cronbach’s alpha. Addi-
tionally, if the average inter-item correlation increases, Cronbach’s alpha increases
as well (holding the number of items constant). This study uses Cronbach’s alpha
to check how closely related a set of markets are as a group and whether they
indeed form a ‘group’ among themselves.

2.5 Trends and Latent Structure in Indian Stock Market:
Bombay Stock Exchange
1. Trends over the entire period: 2005 January to 2012 September
The study starts from an analysis of correlation among the different indexes.
Table 2.1 suggests presence of statistically signiﬁcant correlation among market as
well as sectoral returns over the entire study period.
To justify the use of EFA over the chosen data set we consider the KMO and
Bartlett’s tests for data adequacy. The KMO measure of sampling adequacy takes
a value of 0.873 and Bartlett’s test statistic of sphericity is signiﬁcant at one
percent level of signiﬁcance implying validity of using EFA on our data set.
Based on eigenvalue a single factor (eigenvalue 8.784) is extracted that
explains 73.2 % of total variability. The single factor contains all the indexes that
are highly loaded in that factor. The Cronbach’s alpha stands at 0.9631 and
declines with exclusion of each index. This makes the extracted structure a valid
one (Table 2.2).
The presence of a single structure implies the presence of a single dominant
trend in the market. All the sectors and the market move in similar fashion and
direction (as reﬂected in their positive loadings on the factor). The indexes are
highly correlated and together they reﬂect a distinct and broad market trend. The
detailed analysis of such broad, dominant trend could be of further interest.
Analysis of market trend: use of factor score
In EFA, factors represent latent constructs. From a practical standpoint,
researchers often estimate scores on a latent construct (i.e., factor scores) and use
them instead of the set of items that load on that factor. While constructing a factor
score, researchers could use the sum or average of the scores on items loading on
that factor. However, the procedure could be reﬁned and made statistically
acceptable by using the information contained in the factor solution. The problem
with such elementary construction of factor score is that simple average uses only
the information that the set of items load on a given factor. The process fails if
items have different loadings on the factor. In such cases, some items, with rela-
tively high loadings, are better measures of the underlying factor (i.e., more highly
correlated with the factor) than others. Therefore, construction of ‘good’ factor
scores requires attaching higher weights to items with high loadings and vice
versa. The weights that are used to combine scores on observed items to form
factor scores could be obtained through some form of least squares regression.
Thus, the factor scores obtained serve as estimates of their corresponding unob-
served counterparts.
The use of EFA on our data set extracts a single factor that could be thought of
as representing the broad trend in the stock market. However, the stock market
trend could not be properly or effectively analyzed until and unless we could get
some proxy for this trend. Individual items in the factors (the market index and all
the sectoral indexes) could be analyzed separately but the process will provide us

with hardly any insight regarding the broad trend. We could instead construct the
factor score for our single extracted factor. These factor scores then could serve as
a proxy for the latent structure of the market. That is where the study moves next.
The movement or behavior of market trends (given by the factor scores),
henceforth described as the stock market is depicted in Fig. 2.1. As is evident from
the diagram, the stock market movement is highly volatile, characterized by the
presence of volatility clustering where periods of high (low) volatility are followed
by periods of high (low) volatility. However, from the simple plot it is difﬁcult to
form any idea regarding the trends and nature of movements properly.
The trend could be better analyzed if it is possible to bring out the nature of the
cycle inherent in the series. For this purpose, the study uses the method of band
pass (frequency) ﬁlter. The band pass (frequency) ﬁlters are used to isolate the
cyclical component of a time series by specifying a range for its duration. The
band pass ﬁlter is a linear ﬁlter that takes a two-sided weighted moving average of
the data where cycles in a ‘‘band’’, given by a speciﬁed lower and upper bound, are
‘‘passed’’ through, or extracted, and the remaining cycles are ‘‘ﬁltered’’ out. To use
a band pass ﬁlter, we have to ﬁrst specify the ‘periods’ to ‘pass through. The
periods are deﬁned in terms of two numbers (PL and PU) based on the units of the
frequency of the series used. There are different band pass ﬁlters that differ in their
treatment of the moving average. The study uses the full sample asymmetric ﬁlter,
where the weights on the leads and lags are allowed to differ. The asymmetric ﬁlter
is time-varying with the weights both depending on the data and changing for each
observation. The study uses the Christiano–Fitzgerald (CF) form of this ﬁlter. As a
rule of thumb, PL and PU are set as 1.5 and 8 years for yearly data. The ranges for
daily data should be adjusted accordingly. The series is found to be level stationary
using Augmented Dickey Fuller test statistic (null hypothesis of unit root is

rejected at one percent level of signiﬁcance). We chose to de-trend the data before
ﬁltering. The cycle is depicted in Fig. 2.2.
The return-cycle for the stock market enables us to identify the ups and downs
in BSE. The stock market as a whole experiences a boom during the phases
namely, 2006–2007, 2009–2010, and since early 2012. The market as a whole
slides down from its peak over the periods namely, 2007–2008 and 2010–2011.
Our analysis is concentrated around the ﬁrst cycle.
The trend is further analyzed through an examination of the risk-return rela-
tionship in the market as a whole. The variance of a series could serve as a good
proxy for the risk of the series. As is suggested by the simple plot of the stock market
return, the series is characterized by volatility clustering or volatility pooling.
Moreover the series is negatively skew (skewness -0.23), highly peaked (kurtosis
6.65), and non-normal. Such a series is best analyzed by an appropriate GARCH
family model and risk for such a series is proxied best by its conditional variance.
The stock market is modeled best by Exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model,
an asymmetric GARCH model of order (1, 1). The study uses the version of the
model ﬁrst proposed by Nelson in 1991. The EGARCH (1, 1) model can be
speciﬁed as:
log r2

j  E zt1

j

Þ

Þ þ czt1 þ blogðr2
t1Þ; where et1 ¼ rt1zt1
ð2:9Þ
The dependent variable is not the conditional variance, but rather the log of
conditional variance. Hence the leverage effect is exponential rather than quadratic
in the EGARCH model. The EGARCH model overcomes the most important
limitation of the GARCH model by incorporating the leverage effect. If a [ 0 and
c ¼ 0; the innovation in log r2

is positive (negative) when zt1 is larger (smaller)

Another
signiﬁcant
improvement of the EGARCH process is that it contains no inequality constraint,

can take negative value so there are fewer

persistence by looking at the stationarity and ergodicity conditions. However, the
EGARCH model is also not free from its drawbacks. This model is difﬁcult to use
for there is no analytic form for the volatility term structure.
As is suggested by Table 2.3, the stock market is characterized by asymmetric
response of volatility toward positive and negative announcements in the market.
The market reacts more toward the negative news than toward the good news.
The conditional volatility for the series is saved and depicted in Fig. 2.3.
The conditional variance, after de-trending, exhibits signiﬁcant cyclical pattern

The conditional volatility has been signiﬁcantly higher during the period of
ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–2008. The two other peaks are not at all signiﬁcant
compared to this peak. Thus, although the return cyclebrings out two signiﬁcant
peaks in BSE return, conditional variance cycle rules out one and suggests pres-
ence of a single high-volatile period in the market. The peak of 2010–2011 is not
associated with a very high volatility. This justiﬁes our choice of ﬁnancial crisis of
2007–2008 as the most signiﬁcant ﬁnancial crisis of recent years. The cycle of
2010–2012 is yet to be designated as a true ﬁnancial crisis. Interestingly, the nature
of cycle of conditional variance is completely opposite to the cyclical nature of the
return series. Return peaks are always associated with low conditional variance or
conditional variance slumps. This is further analyzed and depicted in Fig. 2.4. The
nature of time-varying conditional correlation between stock market return and
conditional variance brings out the negative relationship between risk and return in
the market.
The conditional correlation has been computed using a multivariate GARCH
technique that models the variance–covariance matrix of a ﬁnancial time series.
This section makes use of Diagonal Vector GARCH (VECH) model of Bollerslev
et al. (1988). In a Diagonal VECH model the variance–covariance matrix of stock
market returns is allowed to vary over time. This model is particularly useful,
unlike the BEKK model of Baba et al. (1990), with more than two variables in the
conditional correlation matrix (Scherrer and Ribarits 2007). However, it is often
difﬁcult to guarantee a positive semi-deﬁnite conditional variance–covariance
matrix in a VECH model (Engel and Kroner 1993; Brooks and Henry 2000).
Following the methodology of Karunanayake et al. (2008) this study avoids this
problem by using the unconditional residual variance as the pre-sample conditional
variance. This is likely to ensure positive semi-deﬁnite variance–covariance matrix
in a diagonal VECH model. Since, we are more interested in volatility co-
movement and spill over, the mean equation of the estimated diagonal VECH
model contains only the constant term. In the n dimension variance–covariance
matrix, H, the diagonal terms will represent the variance and the non-diagonal
terms will represent the covariances. In other words, in

hiit is the conditional variance of ‘ith market in time t; hijt is the conditional
covariance between the ith and jth market in period t (i = j). The conditional
variance depends on the squared lagged residuals and conditional covariance
depends on the cross lagged residuals and lagged covariances of the other series
(Karunanayake et al. 2008). The model could be represented as:
VECH Ht

aii in matrix A, that is the diagonal elements show the own spillover effect. This is
the impact of own past innovations on present volatility. The cross diagonal terms
(aij; i 6¼ j) show the impact of pat innovation in one market on the present vola-
tility of other markets. Similarly, bii in matrix B shows the impact of own past
volatility on present volatility. Likewise, bij represents cross volatility spill over or
the impact of past volatility of the ith market on the present volatility of jth market.
For our purpose, aij’s and bij’s are more important.
As pointed out by Karunanayake et al. (2008) an important issue in estimating a
diagonal VECH model is the number of parameters to be estimated. To solve the
problem, Bollerslev et al. (1988) suggested use of a diagonal form of A and B. A
related issue is to ensure the positive semi-deﬁniteness of the variance–covariance
matrix. The condition is easily satisﬁed if all of the parameters in A, B, and C are
positive with a positive initial conditional variance–covariance matrix. Bollerslev
et al. (1988) suggested some restrictions to impose that have been followed by
Karunanayake et al. (2008). They used maximum likelihood function to generate
these parameter estimates by imposing some restriction on the initial value. If h be
the parameter for a sample of T observations, the log likelihood function will be:

The presample values of h can be set to be equal to their expected value of zero
(Bollerslev et al. 1988). The Ljung Box test statistic could further be used to test
for remaining ARCH effects. For a stationary time series of T observations and a
multivariate process of order (p, q) the Ljung Box test statistic is given as:

the number of lags used, T is the number of observations. For large sample, the test
statistic is distributed as a v2 under the null hypothesis of no remaining ARCH
effect.
A multivariate GARCH of appropriate order has been estimated for the data on
factor scores for BSE return and BSE conditional variance and the conditional
correlation values have been saved. The movement in this conditional correlation

reﬂects the risk-return relationship in the context of BSE. During most of the time
period, particularly during the ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–2008, risk and return had
been perfectly negatively correlated (correlation coefﬁcient = -1). For only a
short period of time, risk and return was perfectly positively correlated (correlation
coefﬁcient = +1). This suggests the presence of dominantly negative (perfect)
risk-return relationship in BSE. More interestingly, correlation coefﬁcient was
either +1 or -1. Only for a short period of time (during August 2010 to January
2012) correlation coefﬁcient remained positive and ﬂuctuated. The characteristics
in conditional correlation could further be traced in the cycle in conditional cor-
relation (Fig. 2.5).
The analysis of overall market trend would now be supplemented by analyses
of market trend before and after the crisis.
2. The trends in the pre-crisis period: 2005 January to 2008 January
The analysis of trends in the market in the pre-crisis period starts from iden-
tiﬁcation of latent structure in the market.
Table 2.4 suggests presence of statistically signiﬁcant correlation among mar-
ket as well as sectoral returns during the pre-crisis.The correlation coefﬁcients are
more or less the same in magnitude compared to those for the entire period.
The use of EFA over the pre-crisis data set is further justiﬁed by the favorable
values of the KMO measure of sampling adequacy and Bartlett’s tests for data
adequacy. The KMO measure of sampling adequacy takes a value of 0.885 and
Bartlett’s test statistic of sphericity is signiﬁcant at one percent level of signiﬁ-
cance implying validity of using EFA on the pre-crisis data set.
On the basis of eigenvalue a single factor (eigenvalue 8.908) is extracted that
explains 74.2 % of total variability. Both the eigenvalue and the total variability
explained by the single factor extracted are higher than those obtained for the
entire period. Once again, the single factor contains all the indexes that are highly
loaded in that factor. The Cronbach’s alpha stands at 0.9650 (which is higher than
the entire period) and declines with exclusion of each index. This makes the
extracted structure, once again a valid one (Table 2.5).

Trends in Indian Stock Market: Scope for Designing Proﬁtable Trading Rule?

The presence of a single structure implies the presence of a single dominant
trend in the market even in the pre-crisis period. All the sectors and the market
move in similar fashion and direction (as reﬂected in their positive loadings on the
factor). The indexes are highly correlated and together they reﬂect a distinct and
broad market trend. The detailed analysis of such broad, dominant trend in the pre-
crisis period would be our further area of analysis.
Analysis of market trend in pre-crisis period: use of factor score
The use of EFA on our pre-crisis data set extracts a single factor that could be
thought of as representing the broad trend in the stock market in the pre-crisis
period. However, this stock market trend cannot be properly or effectively ana-
lyzed until and unless we could get some proxy for this trend. Just like the previous
case, we have constructed the factor score for our single extracted factor for the
pre-crisis period. These factor scores then serve as a proxy for the latent structure
of the pre-crisis market.
The movement or behavior of market trends (given by the factor scores),
henceforth described as the stock market in pre-crisis period, is depicted in
Fig. 2.6. As is evident from the diagram, the stock market movement is highly
volatile, characterized by the presence of volatility clustering where periods of
high (low) volatility are followed by periods of high (low) volatility. However,
from the simple plot it is difﬁcult to form any idea regarding the trends and nature
of movements properly. The trend in the pre-crisis period resembles that for the
entire Period.
The trend could be better analyzed if it is possible to bring out the nature of the
cycle inherent in the series. The cycle is generated once again using the method of
band pass (frequency) ﬁlter in its CF form. The pre-crisis series is found to be
level stationary using Augmented Dickey Fuller test statistic (null hypothesis of
unit root is rejected at one percent level of signiﬁcance). We chose to de-trend the
data before ﬁltering. The cycle is depicted in Fig. 2.7.

The cycle for the stock market enables us to identify the ups and downs in
returns in the BSE in the pre-crisis period. As suggested by our earlier analysis, the
stockmarket as a whole experienced a boom during the phases namely, 2006–2007,
2009–2010, and since early 2012. The market as a whole slides down from its peak
over the periods namely, 2007–2008 and 2010–2011. An analysis of the pre-crisis
period return shows distinct cycle that is different from the cycle that we obtained
from our earlier analysis of the entire period. If we could take the pre-crisis period
separately, and not as a part of the entire period, a small peak could be traced
during the period of 2005–2006. This peak was not very prominent in the cycle for
the entire period. There has been another signiﬁcant peak in the pre-crisis period
that could be traced during the period of 2007–2008. The market in the pre-crisis
period started declining just toward the end of the period namely in January 2008.
The trend is further analyzed through examination of the risk-return relation-
ship in the market as a whole. The variance of a series could serve as a good proxy
for the risk of the series. As is suggested by the simple plot of the stock market
return, the series is characterized by volatility clustering or volatility pooling.
Moreover, the series is negatively skew (skewness -0.25), highly peaked (kurtosis
8.65), and non-normal. Such a series is best analyzed by an appropriate GARCH
family model and risk for such a series is proxied best by its conditional variance.
The stock market is modeled best by EGARCH, an asymmetric GARCH model
of order (1, 1, 1). As is suggested by Table 2.6, the stock market in the pre-crisis
period is characterized by asymmetric response of volatility toward positive and
negative announcements in the market. The market reacts more toward the neg-
ative news than toward the good news.
The conditional volatility for the pre-crisis series is saved and depicted in
Fig. 2.8.
The conditional variance, after de-trending, exhibits signiﬁcant cyclical pattern.
The conditional volatility has been signiﬁcantly higher during the period of
2005–2006. The conditional volatility was signiﬁcantly lower during mid-2007.
However, just before the crisis was to set in, conditional volatility started
mounting. Thus risk in a market (given by the conditional variance) starts esca-
lating as the market approaches a crisis. The risk-return relationship in the market
is further analyzed and depicted in Fig. 2.9. The nature of time-varying conditional

correlation brings out the presence of a positive relationship between risk and
return in the market. While the correlation ﬂuctuates, it started declining since
mid-2007 and approached zero toward the beginning of the crisis.
Hence, the analysis of pre-crisis period reveals few notable characteristics of
Indian stock market:
• Indian stock market is dominated by a ‘‘single’’ trend where all the sectors and
the market move together. The trend in the pre-crisis period is stronger than the
‘average’ (the trend for the entire period) market trend.
• The entire stock market is characterized by signiﬁcant volatility with volatility
clustering.

• Asymmetric response of volatility toward good and bad news where volatility
responds more toward bad news. The leverage effect is more pronounced in the
pre-crisis period (coefﬁcient = -0.23) compared to the entire period (-0.11)
• Returns start falling and risks start mounting as the market approaches a crisis.
• Market is mostly characterized by a positive risk-return relationship. However,
the correlation coefﬁcient between risk and return starts declining as the market
approaches crisis. Just before the crisis sets in, the correlation coefﬁcient
becomes zero.
3. The trends in the post-crisis period: 2008 February to 2012 September
The analysis of market trend in the post-crisis period starts from identiﬁcation
of latent structure in the market. Table 2.7 suggests presence of statistically sig-
niﬁcant correlation among market as well sectoral returns during the post-crisis
period. The correlation coefﬁcients are more or less the same in magnitude
compared to those for the entire and pre-crisis period.
The use of EFA over the post-crisis period data set is once again justiﬁed by the
favorable values of the KMO measure of sampling adequacy and Bartlett’s tests
for data adequacy. The KMO measure of sampling adequacy takes a value of 0.866
and Bartlett’s test statistic of sphericity is signiﬁcant at one percent level of sig-
niﬁcance implying validity of using EFA on the post-crisis data set.
On the basis of eigenvalue a single factor (eigenvalue 8.740) is extracted that
could explains 72.83 % of total variability. Both the eigenvalue and the total
variability explained by the single factor extracted are lower than those obtained
for the entire period as well as for the pre-crisis period. Once again, the single
factor contains all the indexes that are highly loaded in that factor. The Cronbach’s
alpha stands at 0.9625 (which is lower than those obtained for the entire period as
well as for the pre-crisis period) and declines with exclusion of each index. This
makes the extracted structure, once again a valid one (Table 2.8).

The presence of a single structure implies the presence of a single dominant
trend in the market even in the post-crisis period. All the sectors and the market
move in similar fashion and direction (as reﬂected in their positive loadings on the
factor). The indexes are highly correlated and together they reﬂect a distinct and
broad market trend. The detailed analysis of such broad, dominant trend in the
post-crisis period would be our further area of analysis.
Analysis of market trend in post-crisis period: use of factor score
The use of EFA on our post-crisis data set extracts a single factor that could be
thought of as representing the broad trend in the stock market in the post-crisis
period. However, to analyze this stock market trend properly and effectively, we
need to get some proxy for this trend. Just like the previous two cases, we have
constructed the factor score for our single extracted factor for the post-crisis
period. These factor scores then serve as a proxy for the latent structure of the post-
crisis market.
The movement or behavior of market trends (given by the factor scores),
henceforth described as the stock market in post-crisis period, is depicted in
Fig. 2.10. As it is evident from the diagram, the stock market movement is highly
volatile, characterized by the presence of volatility clustering where periods of
high (low) volatility are followed by periods of high (low) volatility. However,
from the simple plot it is difﬁcult to form any idea regarding the trends and nature
of movements properly. The trend in the post-crisis period resembles those for the
entire as well as the pre-crisis periods. The volatility is signiﬁcantly higher during
the period of February 2008 to March 2009: the period when stock market was
sliding.

The trend could be better analyzed if it is possible to bring out the nature of the
cycle inherent in the series. The cycle in the post-crisis market return movement is
depicted in Fig. 2.11. The cycle is generated once again using the same method of
band pass (frequency) ﬁlter in its CF form. The post-crisis series is found to be
level stationary using Augmented Dickey Fuller test statistic (null hypothesis of
unit root is rejected at one percent level of signiﬁcance). We chose to de-trend the
data before ﬁltering. The cycle is depicted in Fig. 2.11.
The cycle for the stock market enables us to identify the ups and downs in
returns in the BSE in the post-crisis period. The return was lower during the period
of 2008–2009, the period of crisis. Return increased gradually over the year of
2009 and reached a peak in November 2009. Return dipped since then and made a
gradual, but not very signiﬁcant improvement since mid-2011. The trend is further
analyzed through examination of the risk-return relationship in the market as a
whole in the post-crisis period. The variance of a series could serve as a good
proxy for the risk of the series. As is suggested by the simple plot of the stock
market return, the series is characterized by volatility clustering or volatility
pooling. Moreover, the series is negatively skew (skewness -0.26), highly peaked
(kurtosis 7.65), and non-normal. Such a series is best analyzed by an appropriate
GARCH family model and risk for such a series is proxied best by its conditional
variance.
The stock market is modeled best by EGARCH, an asymmetric GARCH model
of order (1, 1). As is suggested by Table 2.9 the stock market in the post-crisis
period is characterized by asymmetric response of volatility toward positive and
negative announcements in the market. The market reacts more toward the neg-
ative news than toward the good news.
The conditional volatility for the post-crisis series is saved and depicted in
Fig. 2.12.
The conditional variance, after de-trending, exhibits signiﬁcant cyclical pattern.
The conditional volatility has been signiﬁcantly higher during the period of
2008–2009. The conditional volatility was signiﬁcantly lower during late
2009–2011. Thus, volatility and hence risk, remained signiﬁcantly higher during
the period of crisis. The risk-return relationship in the market is further analyzed
and depicted in Fig. 2.13. The nature of time-varying conditional correlation

brings out the presence of a positive relationship between risk and return in the
market. During the period of 2008, the correlation coefﬁcient was negative,
implying a negative risk-return relationship in the market. Since then the risk-
return relationship has been mostly positive, with some exceptions during
2010–2011 and during late 2012. The conditional correlation cycle in the post-
crisis period is, however, smoother compared to that in the pre-crisis period.
Hence, the analysis of post-crisis period reveals few notable characteristics of

Trends in Indian Stock Market: Scope for Designing Proﬁtable Trading Rule?

• Indian stock market is dominated by a ‘‘single’’ trend where all the sectors and
the market move together. The trend in the post-crisis period is weaker than the
‘average’ (the trend for the entire period) market trend as well as the trend in the
pre-crisis period.
• The market is characterized by signiﬁcant volatility with volatility clustering.
• Asymmetric response of volatility toward good and bad news where volatility
responds more toward bad news. The leverage effect is less pronounced in the
post-crisis period (coefﬁcient = -0.08) compared to that in the entire period (-
0.11) and in the pre-crisis period (-0.23).
• Returns start falling and risks start mounting as the market plunges into a crisis.
• Market is mostly characterized by a positive risk-return relationship. However,
the correlation coefﬁcient between risk and return starts declining and becomes
negative as the market dips into crisis.
The trends in BSE: Any ‘Signal’ to frame proﬁtable trading strategy?
Over the past 8 years, the Indian stock market, as represented by the BSE, is
dominated by a ‘‘single’’ trend where all the sectors and the market move together.
The latent structure of the market is constructed of all the sectors and the market
Index. The structure has remained unchanged over the past 8 years and has been
independent of the cycles in the economy. Moreover, the trend in the post-crisis
period is weaker than the ‘average’ (the trend for the entire period) market trend,
whereas the trend in the pre-crisis period is stronger than the ‘average’. This is
revealed by the EFA where the single factor extracted could account for more
variability (as given by the values of the Eigenvectors) in the pre-crisis period than
for the post-crisis period. Further analysis of eigenvalue and eigenvector compo-
sition might provide us with signiﬁcant signals that might be useful as an indicator
of future events. For example, if a unique eigenvector composition is consistently
observed before a market crash or period of market growth, then this unique
eigenvector provides a signal that can be responded to in the future. As the
economy passes through different stages, and market forces change, the eigen-
vectors might be expected to change to describe the new situation. Thus, an
analysis of trends in Eigenvector might help us identify pattern and trend in market

movements. This in turn might help investors design strategies that would reduce
risk and increase gains.
As suggested by our earlier analysis, the market is dominated by a single trend.
The single eigenvalue, however, is changing from month to month (Fig. 2.14). The
fraction of market variation captured by the ﬁrst eigenvector thus changes over
time. The movements are sometime marked by sharp changes.
Starting from January 2005, eigenvalue increases sharply over the ﬁrst 15
months. It then falls gradually and reaches a slump during the 25th month. The
following months (25th to 40th) witnessed a moderate rise in eigenvalue. The 45th
to 65th months witnessed a fall in eigenvalue. The movement in the eigenvalue
might indicate the fact that the periods between 0th and 10th month and between
25th and 40th month might be associated with some signiﬁcant market event so
that a larger portion of market variability is being captured by the ﬁrst (in this
context, the single) eigenvector. Thus, when the market experiences or passes
through some ‘extra-ordinary’ events, some ‘unique’ or ‘special’ trend persists in
the market. As the economy reverts back to its ‘normal’ state this ‘special’ trend
weakens in the sense that the variability captured by the ﬁrst factor declines
steadily. For investors this information might be extremely useful in designing
proﬁtable trading strategy. To be more speciﬁc, if it is possible to identify when
this special trend would set in or how long it would last, investors might be able to
design strategies to make proﬁt out of market movements. The movements in the
ﬁrst factor eigenvalue reveal few more observations. The eigenvalue increases
during the periods of recovery and reaches maximum just before the peak. During
a stable period, however, the eigenvalue falls or reaches a plateau. Therefore, the
‘special’ trend persists during the phases of recovery and weakens during the
periods of recession or stability. The market crash could be predicted from a high
eigenvalue of the ﬁrst factor and high eigenvalue could be associated with market
crash. In Indian context, hence, there is immense scope for the investors to use this
piece of information to design proﬁtable trading strategyin BSE.
Apart from the presence of a special trend in the market, BSE is characterized by
the presence of signiﬁcant volatility in stock return. The volatility responds asym-
metrically toward good and bad news with sharper reaction toward bad news. The
asymmetric responses (the ‘leverage’ effect) tend to be sharper during the pre-crisis
period rather than in the post-crisis period. The ‘normal’ positive relationship between
risk and return seems to exist in the market. However, the correlation coefﬁcient

between risk and return starts declining and becomes negative (or even zero) as the
market dips into crisis. Distinct and persistent trends thus are perceptible in the Indian
stock market leaving the efﬁcient market hypothesis on trial. Such trends could
skillfully be used by investors to design proﬁt making strategies to beat the market.
Let us now consider the other stock exchange, namely the NSE and explore
whether the movements and other characteristics in the NSE resemble the trends in
BSE. While exploring the issues, we shall be following the same methodologies
that were followed in the previous sections. Hence, we are not repeating the
methodology, but reporting the results only focusing on the analytical discussion.
2.6 Trends and Latent Structure in Indian Stock Market:
National Stock Exchange
1. Trends over the entire period: 2005 January to 2012 September
The analysis of market movement in NSE starts from the analysis of correlation
among the different indexes. Table 2.10 reveals signiﬁcant correlation pattern in
the NSE.
While statistically signiﬁcant correlation exists among the sectoral returns,
correlation between the market and the sectoral returns has been almost negligible.
This is in sharp contrast with the trends in BSE. While in BSE all the sectors and
the market were intertwined, NSE market is likely to be segregated from the
sectors as a whole. Such a simple correlation analysis, however, hardly sufﬁces to
establish such segregation. EFA might help us better analyze the trends.
The KMO measure of sampling adequacy takes a value of 0.89 and Bartlett’s
test statistic of sphericity is signiﬁcant at one percent level of signiﬁcance
implying validity of using EFA on our data set.
On the basis of eigenvalue, two factors are extracted. The ﬁrst factor with an
eigenvalue of 9.129, explains 70 % of total variability. The second factor has an
eigenvalue of 1.006 and explains 8 % of total variability. The ﬁrst factor contains all
the sectoral indexes that are highly loaded in that factor. The Cronbach’s alpha stands
at 0.95 and declines with exclusion of each index. This makes the extracted structure
a valid one. The second factor contains the market index only (Table 2.11).
Identiﬁcation of two factors reveals presence of two structures, and hence two
dominant trends in the NSE. All the sectors move in similar fashion and direction
(as reﬂected in their positive loadings on the factor) and together they constitute
the broad, dominant trend in NSE. The sectoral returns however are completely
dissociated from the market trend. The sectoral trend happens to be more dominant
than the market itself. The detailed analysis of such broad, dominant trend could
be of further interest.
Analysis of market trend in NSE: use of factor score
The use of EFA on our data set for NSE extracts two factors that could be
thought of as representing the broad trends in the stock market. Now we construct

factor scores for the two uncorrelated factors. These factor scores, just like our
earlier analysis, would serve as a proxy for the latent structure of the market and
help us analyze the stock market trend in proper or effective way.
The factor scores for the ﬁrst factor would depict the movement or behavior at
the sectoral level. Such trends will henceforth be described as the sectoral trend.
The sectoral trend is depicted in Fig. 2.15. As is evident from the diagram, the
sectoral return movement is highly volatile, characterized by the presence of
volatility clustering where periods of high (low) volatility are followed by periods
of high (low) volatility. The period of ﬁnancial crisis that is the period of
2007–2009 is characterized by high volatility.
The factor scores for the second factor reﬂects the movement in NSE market
index and would be henceforth described as reﬂecting the market trend. The
market trend is depicted in Fig. 2.16. Just like the trends at the sectoral level, the
market movements volatile are characterized by the presence of volatility clus-
tering where periods of high (low) volatility are followed by periods of high (low)
volatility. The period of ﬁnancial crisis that is the period of 2007–2009 is char-
acterized by high volatility.
However, from the simple plot it is difﬁcult to form any proper or conclusive
idea regarding the trends and nature of movements.

Just like our earlier analysis, trends at market and sectoral levels would now be
analyzed by bringing out the nature of the cycle inherent in the series. Toward the
purpose, the study uses once again the method of band pass (frequency) ﬁlter. Both
the series are found to be level stationary using Augmented Dickey Fuller test
statistic (null hypothesis of unit root is rejected at one percent level of signiﬁ-
cance). We chose to de-trend the data before ﬁltering. The cycle for the sectoral
return is depicted in Fig. 2.17.
The cycle for the sectoral return enables us to identify the ups and downs in
NSE sectoral indexes. The sectors as a whole experience a boom during the phases
namely, 2006–2007, 2009–2010, and since early 2012. The trends are similar to
those experienced in the context of BSE. The sectors as a whole slide down from
its peak over the periods namely, 2007–2008 and 2010–2011. Our analysis is
concentrated around the ﬁrst cycle. This cycle, however, is in terms of return in the
sectors.
The market return cycle is depicted in Fig. 2.18. The nature of the cycle is
exactly similar to those experienced at the sectoral level.

Although the two latent structures in the market are uncorrelated, the cycles are
similar at the sectoral as well as at the market level. States of economy (recovery
or recession) are having similar impacts on sectoral and market level.
The trend is further analyzed through an examination of the risk-return rela-
tionship in the market as a whole. The variance of a series could serve as a good
proxy for the risk of the series. As is suggested by the simple plot of the market
and sectoral return, the two series are characterized by volatility clustering or
volatility pooling. Moreover, the two series are negatively skew, highly peaked,
and non-normal. Such series are best analyzed by an appropriate GARCH family
model and risk for such a series is proxied best by its conditional variance.
The two series are modeled best by simple GARCH model of order (1, 1). The
two series are hence not characterized by asymmetric response of volatility toward
positive and negative announcements in the market. There is no evidence that the
market or the sectors reacts more toward the negative news than toward the good
news. The sectoral return as a whole is characterized by signiﬁcant presence of
ARCH (or, the news) effect and GARCH (the own past volatility) impacts. The
ARCH effect (0.12), however, is weaker than the GARCH effect (0.87). Hence, past
volatility, rather than past news at the sectoral level has relatively stronger impact
on present volatility of the sectoral return. The market return is also characterized
by signiﬁcant presence of ARCH (0.11) and GARCH (0.88) effects with GARCH
effects stronger than the ARCH effects. The results are similar to those obtained for
the sectoral level. The ARCH effect at the sectoral level is marginally higher and
GARCH effect is marginally lower compared to the market level.
The conditional volatility for the sectoral return is saved and depicted in
Fig. 2.19.
The conditional variance, after de-trending, exhibits signiﬁcant cyclical pattern
(Fig. 2.20).
The conditional volatility has been signiﬁcantly higher during the period of
ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–2008. The two other peaks are not at all signiﬁcant compared
to this peak. The trend reminds us about the trend in BSE over the same period. Once
again, the nature of cycle of conditional variance is completely opposite to the
cyclical nature of the return series. Return peaks are always associated with low
conditional variance or conditional variance slumps. This is further analyzed and

depicted in Fig. 2.21. The nature of time-varying conditional correlation between
sectoral return in NSE and conditional variance is used to bring out the relationship
between risk and return at the sectoral level in NSE. Like the previous section, the
conditional correlation has been computed using a multivariate GARCH technique
that models the variance–covariance matrix of a ﬁnancial time series. A multivariate
GARCH of appropriate order has been estimated for the data on two factor scores for
NSE return and NSE conditional variance and the conditional correlation values
have been saved. The movement in this conditional correlation reﬂects the risk-
return relationship in the context of NSE.
The risk-return relationship has been negative and falling until mid-2006. During
the period that immediately preceded the crisis, risk-return relationship started
rising. However, it remained negative until mid 2007. As crisis set in, the risk-return
relationship became positive and continued to rise. As crisis continued, risk-return
relationship at the NSE sectoral level remained constant and positive. However, as
the economy was recovering, the conditional correlation between risk and return
started dwindling. Eventually, the risk-return relationship became negative.
Let us now consider the conditional variance at the market level. The market is
highly volatile and the volatility has been signiﬁcantly higher during the period of
ﬁnancial crisis. The trend could be better analyzed if we could consider the cycle
in volatility at the market level (Fig. 2.22).
The cycle in market return volatility in NSE is depicted in Fig. 2.23. The nature
of the cycle is similar, however not identical, to that in the sectoral return. Vol-
atility remained constant at a very high level during the period of ﬁnancial crisis.
Volatility has been much lower during the pre-crisis and the post-crisis periods.

However, volatility started mounting as the market was approaching the crisis. As
the market was recovering volatility dwindled to reach the ﬂoor.
The risk-return relationship at the market level, however, has been different at
the market level rather than at the sectoral level in NSE. Risk-return relationship
has been negative during the period of January 2005 to January 2007. However, as
the economy was approaching the crisis since mid-2006, the correlation between
risk and return started rising. As the economy was plunging into crisis, the cor-
relation ﬂuctuated but remained negative. The correlation became positive only in
the post-crisis period and eventually started dwindling since mid-2010 (Fig. 2.24).
The analysis of overall market trend would now be supplemented by analyses
of market trend before and after the crisis.

with the sectoral returns. The results are same as those obtained for the entire
period.
The use of EFA over the pre-crisis data set is further justiﬁed by the favorable
values of the KMO measure of sampling adequacy and Bartlett’s tests for data
adequacy. The KMO measure of sampling adequacy takes a value of 0.897 and
Bartlett’s test statistic of sphericity is signiﬁcant at one percent level of signiﬁ-
cance implying validity of using EFA on the pre-crisis data set.
On the basis of eigenvalue two factors are retained that are uncorrelated with
one another. This signiﬁes the presence of two dominant but distinct trends in the
NSE during the pre-crisis period. The ﬁrst factor with an eigenvalue of 9.373 could
explain 72 % of total variability. All the sectoral indexes have strong and positive
loading in the ﬁrst factor. The Cronbach’s alpha stands at 0.9750 (which is higher
than the entire period) and declines with exclusion of each index. This makes the
extracted structure a valid one. Thus the sectors are strongly connected, move in
similar fashion and direction and together they constitute the dominant trend in the
market in the pre-crisis period.The second factor has the market index with strong
loading in it. The market thus is completely decoupled from the sectors that are
closely connected among themselves. The second factor with an eigenvalue of
1.01 could explain only 7.76 % of total variability in the NSE (Table 2.13).
The detailed analysis of such broad, dominant trend in the pre-crisis period
would be our further area of analysis.
Analysis of market trend in NSE in pre-crisis period: use of factor score
Factor scores are constructed for the two factors extracted for the NSE. The
factor scores for the ﬁrst factor represent the sectoral behavior in the market. The
market movement will be proxied by the second factor score. The movement or
behavior of sectoral returns as a whole (given by the factor scores), henceforth
described as the sectors in pre-crisis period, is depicted in Fig. 2.25. As is evident
from the diagrams, the market as well as sectoral movements are highly volatile,
characterized by the presence of volatility clustering where periods of high (low)

volatility are followed by periods of high (low) volatility. However, from the
simple plots it is difﬁcult to form any idea regarding the trends and nature of
movements properly. The trend in the pre-crisis period resembles that for the
entire Period.
The trend could be better analyzed if it is possible to bring out the nature of the
cycle inherent in the series. The cycle in the pre-crisis sectoral and market
movements are depicted in Fig. 2.26. The cycles are generated once again using
the method of band pass (frequency) ﬁlter in its CF form. Both the pre-crisis series

are found to be level stationary using Augmented Dickey Fuller test statistic (null
hypothesis of unit root is rejected at one percent level of signiﬁcance). We chose to
de-trend the data before ﬁltering. The sectoral return reached top during January
2006 and falls then after. The market, however, reached peak in January 2007 and
then plummeted. As the market was riding high, the sectors were offering higher
returns than the market (‘‘beating the market’’, perhaps). During the recession,
sectoral returns remained considerably lower than the market return. The sectoral
peak, however, has been lower than the market peak.
The trend is further analyzed through examination of the risk-return relation-
ship in the market as a whole. The variance of a series could serve as a good proxy
for the risk of the series. As is suggested by the simple plots of the market and
sectoral returns, the series are characterized by volatility clustering or volatility
pooling. Moreover, the series are negatively skew, highly peaked, and non-normal.
Such series are best analyzed by an appropriate GARCH family model and risk for
such a series are proxied best by their conditional variance.
The NSE return is modeled best by simple GARCH model of order (1, 1). The
market, as well as sectors as a whole is characterized by signiﬁcant ARCH and
GARCH effects. The ARCH coefﬁcients are 0.21 and 0.26 respectively for the
market and the sector. The GARCH coefﬁcients for the market and sectors as a
whole are 0.71 and 0.67 respectively. Thus past volatility impacts on present
volatility are stronger than the news impact for the market as well as sectors. Past
volatility impacts however are relatively stronger and news impacts are relatively
weaker for the market rather than the sectors. This is in line with the results
obtained for the entire period. The conditional volatilities for the pre-crisis series
are saved and depicted in Fig. 2.27.
The conditional variance, after de-trending, exhibits signiﬁcant cyclical pattern.
Both the cycles in the conditional variance have been of inverted u shape. Vola-
tility increased, reached a top and then fell for both the sector and the market.
When market volatility was rising, sectoral volatility was higher than the market
volatility up to a certain point. The sectoral volatility reached its peak much before
the crisis had set in and much before the market volatility did so. The conditional
volatility in market increased signiﬁcantly and remained high as the economy was
approaching the crisis. The diagram shows a comparative study of risks (given by

the conditional variance) at the sectoral and the market level. The risk-return
relationship in the NSE is further analyzed and depicted in Fig. 2.28.
The nature of time-varying conditional correlation brings out the presence of a
positive relationship between risk and return in the NSE as a whole. While the
correlation ﬂuctuates, it started declining sharply since early-2007 for the market
and plummeted to a very low level in mid-2007. The risk-return correlation in the
market was increasing sharply during the recession. The sectoral correlation has
mostly been higher than the correlation at the market level. The sectoral corre-
lation dropped to a low level only during mid-2005. The ﬁnancial crisis of
2007–2008 did not have much impact on the risk-return correlation at the sectoral
level. For most of the times, the value of correlation coefﬁcient remained higher
than 0.8.
3. The trends in the post-crisis period: 2008 February to 2012 September
The analysis of market trend in the post-crisis period starts from identiﬁcation
of latent structure in the market.
Table 2.14 suggests presence of statistically signiﬁcant correlation among
sectoral returns during the post-crisis period. The correlation between the market
and the sector, however, has been quite low and in signiﬁcant. The results are
similar to those obtained for the previous phases. The correlation coefﬁcients are
more or less the same in magnitude compared to those for the entire and pre-crisis
period.
The use of EFA over the post-crisis period data set is once again justiﬁed by the
favorable values of the KMO measure of sampling adequacy and Bartlett’s tests
for data adequacy. The KMO measure of sampling adequacy takes a value of 0.875
and Bartlett’s test statistic of sphericity is signiﬁcant at one percent level of sig-
niﬁcance implying validity of using EFA on the post-crisis data set.
On the basis of eigenvalue, once again, two factors are extracted that are
uncorrelated to each other. The ﬁrst factor with an eigenvalue 9.007 explains
69.29 % of total variability. The second factor with eigenvalue of 1.009 explains
7.76 % of total variability. Both the eigenvalue and the total variability explained
by the single factor extracted are lower than those obtained for the entire period as

well as for the pre-crisis period. Once again, the ﬁrst factor contains all the
sectoral indexes that are highly and positively loaded in that factor. The Cron-
bach’s alpha stands at 0.9525 (which is lower than those obtained for the entire
period as well as for the pre-crisis period) and declines with exclusion of each
index. This makes the extracted structure, once again a valid one. The second
factor has the market index with strong loading in it (Table 2.15).
The NSE is characterized by two distinct trends in the post-crisis period. The
sectors constitute the broad, dominant trend and they, among themselves are
strongly correlated and move in similar fashion and similar direction even in the
post-crisis period. All the sectors and the market move in similar fashion and
direction (as reﬂected in their positive loadings on the factor). The detailed
analysis of the dominant trends in the post-crisis period would be our further area
of analysis.
Analysis of market trend in post-crisis period: use of factor score
Just like the previous cases, we have constructed the factor scores for the two
extracted factors for the post-crisis period. These factor scores would serve as a
proxy for the latent structure of the post-crisis market.
The movement or behavior of market and sectoral trends (given by the factor
scores), are depicted in Fig. 2.29. As is evident from the diagram, the market and
sectoral movements are highly volatile, characterized by the presence of volatility
clustering where periods of high (low) volatility are followed by periods of high
(low) volatility. However, from the simple plot it is difﬁcult to form any idea
regarding the trends and nature of movements properly. The trend in the post-crisis
period resembles those for the entire as well as the pre-crisis periods. The vola-
tility is signiﬁcantly higher during the period of February 2008 to March 2009: the
period when stock market was sliding.
The trend could be better analyzed if it is possible to bring out the nature of the
cycle inherent in the series. The cycles are generated once again using the same
method of band pass (frequency) ﬁlter in its CF form. The post-crisis series are

found to be level stationary using Augmented Dickey Fuller test statistic (null
hypothesis of unit root is rejected at one percent level of signiﬁcance). We chose to
de-trend the data before ﬁltering. The cycles are depicted in Fig. 2.30.
The cycle for the stock market enables us to identify the ups and downs in
returns in the NSE in the post-crisis period. The sectoral and market cycles are
almost similar in nature. Both the cycles are inverted u-shaped. When the economy
was recovering after the crisis, sectoral returns were marginally lower than the
market return. Similar behavior was observed when economy is sliding down in
recent years. The sectoral peak, however, is higher than the market peak. This
relationship is completely different from that obtained for the pre-crisis period.
The trend in NSE is further analyzed through examination of the risk-return
relationship at the market as well as sectoral level in the post-crisis period. As is
suggested by the simple plot of the stock market returns, both the series are
characterized by volatility clustering or volatility pooling. Moreover the series are

negatively skew, highly peaked, and non-normal. Such series could be best ana-
lyzed by an appropriate GARCH family model and risks for such series are
proxied best by the conditional variance.
The market is modeled best by EGARCH, an asymmetric GARCH model of
order (1, 1). As is suggested by Table 2.16, the sectoral return in the post-crisis
period is characterized by asymmetric response of volatility toward positive and
negative announcements in the market. The sectoral return reacts more toward the
negative news than toward the good news.
The market in the post-crisis period is also characterized by asymmetric
response of volatility toward positive and negative announcements in the market.
The market reacts more toward the negative news than toward the good news
(Table 2.17).
This result is in sharp contrast to what we obtained for the pre-crisis period.The
conditional volatility cycles for the post-crisis series are depicted in Fig. 2.31.
The conditional variance, after de-trending, exhibits signiﬁcant cyclical pattern.
The conditional volatility has been signiﬁcantly higher during the period of
2008–2009. The conditional volatility was signiﬁcantly lower during late
2009–2011. Thus, volatility and hence risk, remained signiﬁcantly higher during
the period of crisis. The risk cycles have been almost similar in nature for the
market and the sectors as a whole. As risks were falling sectoral risks were

marginally higher than the market risk. However, during any downfall in the
market when risks were mounting sectoral risks almost coincide with the market
risk.
The risk-return relationship in the NSE in the post-crisis period is further
analyzed and depicted in Fig. 2.32. The nature of time-varying conditional cor-
relation brings out the nature of risk-return relationship in the market. The cor-
relation between risk and return in the market level fell just after the crisis and
remained marginally positive over the entire post-crisis period. Risk-return rela-
tionship has been ﬂuctuating and mostly negative at the sectoral level. The cor-
relation became close to zero during the period of 2008–2009 when the economy
was plummeted in crisis.

The trends in National Stock Exchange: Any ‘Signal’ to frame proﬁtable
trading strategy?
NSE has been dominated by two dominant trends in the market. The most
dominant or ‘market’ trend is formed by all the sectors in the NSE. The sectors as
a whole are completely decoupled from the market. The trend has lasted for the
past 8 years. The sectors among themselves however are closely connected among
themselves and move in similar fashion and in similar direction. Such dissociation
between sectoral indexes and market index, that is independent of the states of the
economy, might offer investors proﬁtable business opportunities. Moreover, the
trend in the post-crisis period is weaker than the ‘average’ (the trend for the entire
period) market trend where as the trend in the pre-crisis period is stronger than the
‘average’. This is revealed by the EFA where the single factor extracted could
account for more variability (as given by the values of the eigenvectors) in the pre-

crisis period than for the post-crisis period. In our earlier analysis of eigenvalue
and eigenvector composition for BSE has revealed how that might provide us with
signiﬁcant signals that might be useful as an indicator of future events. The
changing nature of eigenvalue for the ﬁrst factor in NSE has been shown in
Fig. 2.33. The eigenvalue has changed from month to month. The fraction of
market variation captured by the ﬁrst eigenvector thus changes over time. The
movements are sometime marked by sharp changes.
Thus, just like BSE, when the market experiences or passes through some
‘extra-ordinary’ events, some ‘unique’ or ‘special’ trend persists in the market. As
the economy reverts back to its ‘normal’ state this ‘special’ trend weakens in the
sense that the variability captured by the ﬁrst factor declines steadily. For investors
this information might be extremely useful in designing proﬁtable trading strategy.
To be more speciﬁc, if it is possible to identify when this special trend would set in
or how long it would last, investors might be able to design strategies to make
proﬁt out of market movements. The movements in the ﬁrst factor eigenvalue
reveal few more observations. The eigenvalue increases during the periods of
recovery and reaches maximum just before the peak. During a stable period,
however, the eigenvalue falls or reaches a plateau. Therefore, the ‘special’ trend
persists during the phases of recovery and weakens during the periods of recession
or stability. The market crash could be predicted from a high eigenvalue of the ﬁrst
factor and high eigenvalue could be associated with market crash. In the Indian
context, hence, there is immense scope for investors to use this piece of infor-
mation to design a proﬁtable trading strategy in the National Stock Exchange.
While it is evident that some trading or fruitful investment strategies could be
derived for the Indian stock market, it would be of interest to explore how such
strategies could be framed. That is where we move to next.

Possible Investment Strategies in Indian
Stock Market
Abstract This chapter explores the presence of possible and proﬁtable investment
strategies in the Indian stock market. The exploratory factor analysis used in Chap.
2 explored the presence of a distinct latent structure in the Indian stock market.
Given the latent structures in the BSE and NSE, it is indeed possible for investors
to design proﬁtable investment strategies. Both risk-averse and risk-loving
investors might ﬁnd portfolios suitable for them based on different indicators such
as return, risk-adjusted return, systematic, and unsystematic risk. The nature of
such portfolios, however, has changed over time. The ﬁnancial crisis of 2007–2008
has affected some sectors adversely, while some have been able to avoid the
impact of the crisis. Some defensive sectors have emerged out of the crisis with an
aggressive tenor. Portfolios in BSE and NSE moreover have some characteristics
in common. Such discernable patterns in portfolio choice, however, will put
Efﬁcient Market Hypothesis on trial.

3.1 Introduction
The modern portfolio construction theory revolves around the fact that assets of
different categories behave differently from one another. This implies that an asset
from a different class has its own unique risk and return proﬁle. They respond
differently to different economic events and during cycles. The idea of combining
various asset classes, each with unique attributes, is the basis for building a
diversiﬁed portfolio. Any rational investor, however, will always try to build-up a

portfolio with less-risky assets that provide high return: a portfolio that is very
difﬁcult, if not impossible, to construct in the real world. It is then a headache for
the investors to construct a ‘‘perfect’’ portfolio, or a portfolio that closely
resembles the ‘‘perfect’’ one.
Markowitz (1952) asserted that while investing in ﬁnancial assets, looking at
the returns and associated risks is not sufﬁcient. By choosing and combining more
than one stock, it is possible to reduce riskiness of investment: one should not put
all the eggs in one basket. The risk in a portfolio of diverse individual stocks will
be less than the risk inherent in holding any one of the individual stocks (provided
the risks of the various stocks are not positively related). Effective investment,
however, does not mean either picking or combining stocks at random. Rather, it is
the combination of stocks that matters: ﬁnd out the right baskets to keep the eggs.
The Modern portfolio theory suggests that the risk for individual stock returns
could be decomposed into two: (1) the Systematic Risk Component or the market
risks that cannot be diversiﬁed away and (2) the Unsystematic Risk or the risk
speciﬁc to individual stocks that can be diversiﬁed away as one increases the
number of stocks in the portfolio. For a well-diversiﬁed portfolio, individual stock
risks add very little to portfolio risk. Instead, it is the correlation between indi-
vidual stocks’ return that determines overall portfolio risk.
The history of ﬁnancial market movement, however, makes us realize that
portfolio theory is just a theory in itself. At the end of the day, a portfolio’s success
rests on the investor’s skills and the time he or she devotes to it. Sometimes it is
better to pick a small number of out-of-favor investments and wait for the market
to turn in your favor than to rely on market averages alone. Moreover, it is hard to
beat the market. Some beat the market, no doubt, by taking up excessive risk, but
they get their retribution as markets slide down.
Using the information on the latent structure of the Indian stock market let us
now concentrate on some of the possible and proﬁtable investment strategies.
3.2 Investment Strategies in BSE
The BSE is characterized by a single latent structure that includes all the sectors
and the market index. The sectors and the market are closely connected among
themselves. Any portfolio construction by any rational investor is based on a
simple rule of thumb: the returns of the assets constituting the portfolio should not
be very closely related, or even if they are strongly connected, the correlation
among the stock returns should be strongly negative. As revealed by the explor-
atory factor analysis the possible portfolios will have to be constructed using some
assets whose returns are closely connected. We shall, in our further analysis
consider the possible portfolio construction over the three subphases of the study.
The construction of portfolio is based on some indicators described as follows:
Indicator of average return: The average returns are calculated for the market
and the sectoral indexes.
56

Possible Investment Strategies in Indian Stock Market

Indicator of unique risk: A multivariate GARCH of appropriate order has been
estimated taking all the sectors and the market as a ‘system’. The conditional
variances are saved and are used as proxy for unique risk of the Index.
Indicator of market risk: The conditional correlations obtained from the esti-
mation of multivariate GARCH have been used as proxies for market risk. This
type of risk has been once again categorized into two: the conditional correlation
among the sectoral return would proxy for the cross-sectoral risk, the individual
sector’s risk with respect to other sectors; and the conditional correlation between
a sector and the market would serve as the proxy for the market beta.
Indicator of risk-adjusted return: The Sharpe Index deﬁned as (Ri - RF)/Si,
where Ri, RF and Si are returns of i’th asset, risk free rate, and standard deviation
of Ri respectively, serving as proxy for the risk-adjusted return.
Let us now consider some possible portfolios under these circumstances.
3.2.1 Portfolio Construction in BSE: 2005–2012
The sectors and market indexes could be arranged as shown in Table 3.1. The
sectors could be categorized broadly into four groups. The bank and the consumer
durable indexes earn above average return with above average unique risk. The
automobile, capital goods, and FMCG sectors earn above return at below average
return. The metal, PSU, and IT sectors earn below average return at above average
risk. The market index too falls under this category. Healthcare, Oil and Natural
Gas, and Power sectors earn low return at low risk. The market risks are in line
with the unique risks. The sectors with high unique risk have very high conditional
correlation among themselves and with the market.

The risk lover and risk averse: the study deﬁnes a risk lover investor as one who
loves taking risk irrespective of the extent of returns earned. A risk-averse
investor, on the other hand, will be interested in higher return at the cost of lower
risk. Or, alternatively, they would prefer higher risk-adjusted returns. Given the
scenario, the possible portfolios for the investors in the BSE might be the
following:
Investment Strategy 1: A high-return, high-risk group The portfolio would
consist of the BSE Bank Index and BSE Consumer Durable Index. Both the
indexes earn above average returns. The BSE CD and Bank Index returns have
been the second and fourth highest in the market. The portfolio would thus earn
above average return. The unique risk, however, for the individual Indexes has
been substantially high. For each index return, the cross-correlation and the cor-
relation with the market have also been quite high. The risk of the portfolio thus
would be very high. The risk-adjusted returns, however, are quite high for the two
indexes. This might imply that an investor, not so risk-lover and interested in high
risk-adjusted-return might also accept the portfolio.
Investment Strategy 2: A low-return, high-risk group The low-return-high
(both unique and market)-risk portfolio will be accepted neither by the risk lover
nor by the risk-averse investor. This is simply for the reason that the risk-lover
would never accept below average return for taking above average risks. The low
Sharpe ratios for the indexes concerned would make risk-averse investors disin-
terested in the portfolio. The group, however, could be combined with other
groups to make proﬁtable portfolios.
Investment Strategy 3: A combination of (1) high-return, high-risk and (2)
low-return, high-risk group This portfolio, by nature, is extremely risky. The
portfolio would consist of the Bank, Consumer Durable, Metal, PSU, IT, and
possibly the market indexes. While the individual risks are substantially high, the
cross-correlation among the sectoral returns and the correlation of the individual
sectoral returns with that of the market have been above average. The portfolio
might be preferred by extreme risk lovers. However, the low-return, high-risk
group with very low Sharpe ratios will always be dominated by the other group of
high-risk and high-return indexes. For an investor, who is not so risk loving,
portfolio 3 will always be dominated by portfolio 1. The combination is not at all
acceptable to a risk-averse investor.
Investment Strategy 4: A high-return, low-risk group The portfolio would
consist of automobile, capital goods, and FMCG indexes. In terms of return, the
indexes rank third, fourth, and ﬁrst respectively. The unique risks are substantially
lower, the three sectors being the lowest conditional variance sectors. The cross-
correlations among sectors as well as correlations with the market have been the
lowest possible. The FMCG, automobile, and capital goods rank ﬁrst, third, and
sixth respectively. This is the best place of investment for a risk-averse person.

Investment Strategy 5: A combination of high-return, low-risk, and low-
return, low-risk group This group consists of the capital goods, FMCG, auto-
mobile, healthcare, oil and natural gas, and power sectors. The group is an
extremely low-risk group. The cross-correlations among the sectoral returns have
been very low. The correlation with market return has been the lowest for capital
goods, FMCG, automobile, and the healthcare sectors. This correlation has been
marginally higher for the oil and natural gas and power sectors. The sectors
individually have been very low unique risk sectors. The portfolio could well be
accepted by risk-averse investors. However, the low market risk and the high risk-
adjusted return for the capital goods, FMCG, automobile, and healthcare sectors
suggest that a portfolio could be constructed with them that would dominate any
other combination in the group.
Investment Strategy 6: A low-return, low-risk group The group consists of the
healthcare, power, and oil and natural gas sectors. The sectors possess very low
unique risk. While the cross-correlations among sectoral returns have been almost
below average, the market risks have been moderately high. The Sharpe ratios,
however, have not been very high. The portfolio might be accepted by some risk-
averse investors.
3.2.2 Portfolio Construction in BSE in the Pre-crisis Period:
2005–2008
During the pre-crisis period, as suggested by the exploratory factor analysis, there
has been a single latent structure constituted of all the sectors and the market. Any
portfolio construction would then be choosing among a closely connected set of
assets. On the basis of risk-return relationship the indexes in the pre-crisis period
could be categorized into three groups. The groups are shown in Table 3.2. There
is, however, no low-return, high-risk group in the stock market.
The study now considers the possible portfolios that could be constructed
during this period.
Investment Strategy 1: High-return, high-risk group This group earns above
average return but possesses above average risk. The group consists of Metal, CD,
Bank, CG, and Power indexes. The conditional cross-correlations among the
sectoral returns are also high, except for that between CD and Bank index. The
conditional correlation with market return has also been high except for that of
CD. This group thus, could be favored by risk-lover investors. The risk-averse
investor could choose only CD from the group that has very low market risk.
However, the below average Sharpe Ratio for the sector might discourage extreme
risk-averse persons to invest in the sector. Although, the high Sharpe ratio sectors
belong to this group, they will fail to attract the risk-averse investors due to the
high market risk associated with them.
3.2
Investment Strategies in BSE
59

Investment Strategy 2: Investment in single sector—ONG The Oil and Natural
Gas Sector has been a high-mean, low-risk sector that ranks third in terms of
Sharpe ratio. This sector, apart from the uncomfortable part that it has a high
conditional correlation with the market, may be the choice of a risk-averse
investor.
Investment Strategy 3: Investment in single sector, ONG combined with the
market index Investment in ONG could be combined with the market index,
since both are high-return, low-risk indexes. However, extremely risk-averse
investors might be discouraged by the high conditional correlation between the
two indexes.
Investment Strategy 4: Consideration for high return only (combination of
investment in high-return, high-risk group and in high-return, low-risk
group) In construction of such portfolio, ONG or market index or both could be
combined with the High-Return, High-Risk Group. This will further increase the
return of the portfolio. The fact that the unique risk of ONG index is low, however,
does not necessarily mean that the portfolio risk will be minimized. The ONG
index has high cross-correlation with the other members in the group as well as
with the market. This portfolio therefore will be the choice of only risk-lover
investors.
Investment Strategy 5: Consideration for low risk only (combination of
investment in high-return, low-risk group and in low-return, low-risk
group) This group will constitute of ONG, IT, PSU, FMCG, Automobile, and
Healthcare indexes. The cross-correlations among the sectors are low, except for
that between PSU and Automobile. PSU and ONG, on the other hand have high

correlation with market index. The group might be favored by risk-averse inves-
tors. However, some sub-groups could also be formed. Investment in two high-
Sharpe ratio indexes, namely ONG (rank 3) and FMCG (rank 4) could be proﬁt-
able for relatively more risk-averse investor.
Investment Strategy 6: Pessimist investment (investment in low-return, low-
risk group) This group will constitute IT, PSU, FMCG, Automobile, and
Healthcare indexes. The cross-correlations among the sectors are very low, except
for that between PSU and Automobile. PSU on the other hand has high correlation
with market index. The group might be favored by excessively risk-averse
investors who have consideration for low risk only. However, in that context
exclusion of PSU from the portfolio could be more proﬁtable for a pessimist
investor. One thing, however, is to be noted. Given the investment strategy 5,
investment strategy 6 will always be dominated and redundant.
3.2.3 Portfolio Construction in BSE in the Post-crisis
Period: 2008–2012
The post-crisis period, unlike the pre-crisis period, is characterized by the presence
of four groups on the basis of risk-return information. The low-return, high-risk
group was absent in the pre-crisis period. The groups are shown in Table 3.3. The
sectors and the market constitute the single latent structure in the post-crisis BSE.
The portfolios are then to be constructed using a set of closely connected assets.
Under such circumstances, the study considers the following investment strategy.

Investment Strategy 1: High-return, high-risk group The group consists of the
IT, CG, and Metal sectors. The sectors have high unique risk as well as high
market risks. The group might be preferred by risk-loving investors only. The
Negative Sharpe ratio for each of these sectoral indexes will discourage risk-averse
investors to invest in this group. This is the only proﬁtable portfolio for the risk-
lovers. The point will be evidenced from the investment strategy 2.
Investment Strategy 2: Low-return, high-risk group This group consists of
Power, ONG, CD, and Bank indexes. The group will hardly be chosen by any
rational investors because of the negative returns offered by the sectors in the post-
crisis period. Although the consumers’ durable index possesses a high Sharpe ratio
(rank 2), risk-averse investors are unlikely to choose the sector as a proﬁtable place
for investment because of its negative return. The group or its members, either in
isolation or in combination with others, will not be chosen by the Investors. This
makes the group redundant from the point of view of investment.
Investment Strategy 3: Low-return, low-risk group By the similar logic, the
low-return, low-risk group will also be a redundant choice for investment. Usually
these types of assets are preferred by extremely risk-averse investors. This group
contains FMCG sector, the sector with the highest Sharpe ratio. Nonetheless,
investors may not ﬁnd the sector an attractive place of investment due to the
negative returns offered by it.
Investment Strategy 4: High-return, low-risk group This group consists of the
Healthcare and the Automobile sectors. This combination is a risk-averse inves-
tor’s delight to invest in. Apart from the fact that the two sectors are of above
average return and below average risks, they rank high (Rank 2 and 3, respec-
tively) in terms of the Sharpe ratio. This group may be combined with the group of
high-return, high-risk assets judiciously to construct a proﬁtable portfolio.
Now, the study may proceed to compare the investment strategies in the pre-
and post-crisis periods for BSE. The pre-crisis period is characterized by the
presence of three groups in terms of risk-return relationship. The low-return, high-
risk group does not exist in the pre-crisis period. The risk of investment thus was
lower in the pre-crisis period. The risk-lover as well as risk-averse investors was
able to design proﬁtable investment strategies by judicious selection and combi-
nation of the constituents of the three groups. The post-crisis period is different in
the sense that the low-return, high-risk group exists along with the three others.
However, the choice of investment is much limited in the post-crisis period. This is
particularly because of the low and even negative returns earned by many sectors
in the post-crisis period. Hence, the groups consisted of the low (and, negative)
return sectors become redundant for Investors’ choice. There have been some
striking similarities in the nature of the sectoral returns also. Metal and CG have
always remained high-return, high-risk sectors. FMCG and PSU, on the other
hand, have remained low-return, low-risk sectors. There is however, a signiﬁcant
difference. The FMCG and PSU were earning negative returns in the post crisis
period. Thus, crisis has affected the sectors adversely in terms of return. Healthcare

and automobile have remained low risk but changed their return characteristics
with the cycle in the economy. From low-return sectors in the pre-crisis period,
they turned out to be high-return ones in the post-crisis period. The crisis has
transformed the IT sector from a defensive low-return, low-risk sector into an
aggressive high-return, high-risk sector. On the other hand, the aggressive high-
return, high-risk sectors like CD, Bank and Power sectors have turned into rather
unattractive low (even negative)-return, high-risk sectors. Thus, crisis has
adversely affected the sectors like FMCG, PSU, CD, Bank, Power, and ONG
sectors. Of these, perhaps ONG has been the most affected. From an Investor’s
delight in the pre-crisis period (being the most attractive high-return, low risk
sector) it became a high risk sector after the crisis earning negative returns. Metal
and CG have been able to avoid the impacts of crisis, while healthcare and
automobile emerged as proﬁtable places of investment after the crisis. The crisis
has made the IT sector more aggressive in the stock market.
The study thus completes the discussion on designing of proﬁtable investment
strategies in BSE. It now proceeds to explore the presence or otherwise of the same
for the NSE, the other stock market exchange chosen as the representative of the
Indian stock market. The methodologies will remain the same as those used in the
previous section.
3.3 Investment Strategies in NSE
As revealed by the exploratory factor analysis, the NSE is characterized by the
presence of two uncorrelated, latent structures. The sectors constitute the ﬁrst and
the dominant trend where as the market comes under the second and less dominant
structure. Hence, an investor while designing the investment strategy will have to
select and combine sectoral and market indexes judiciously. Let us now consider
the possible investment strategies under NSE and the impact of crisis on them. The
methodologies followed will be the same as those used for the BSE. The sectors,
along with the unique risk, will have only one component of systematic risk
namely the correlation among the sectoral returns. The market is completely
decoupled from the sectors.
3.3.1 Portfolio Construction in NSE: 2005–2012
The sectors are classiﬁed in terms of the risk-return relationship. The rankings,
Sharpe ratios, extent of systematic risks are shown in Table 3.4.
The sectors are grouped into four in terms of the risk-return relationship. The
market is singled out as a high-return, low-risk sector with a positive Sharpe Ratio
(rank 5). Risk-averse investors might ﬁnd the market index as a suitable place for
investment.
3.2

At the sectoral level, the low-return, high-risk group with high systematic risk is
very difﬁcult to be accepted by any investor. The low-return, low-risk group with
moderate systematic risk, on the other hand, might attract some pessimist
investors.
Investment in Sectors: Strategy 1 Investment in the High return, high risk
sector: Risk-averse investors might ﬁnd the sector attractive due to its high Sharpe
ratio. However, this investment will be preferred by the risk-lovers.
Investment in Sectors: Strategy 2 Investment in the High return, low risk sector:
The group with very low systematic risk will be a must-pick-up for the risk-averse
investors. The choice is further justiﬁed by the high Sharpe Ratio ranking of the
constituent sectors (rank 1, 2, and 3 respectively).
Investment in Sectors: Strategy 3 Consideration for high risk independent of
level of return: the investors may think of combining the high-return, high-risk
sector (Finance) with the low-return, high-risk sector constituted of Commodities,
Infrastructure, Metal, and PSUBanks. This combined group, however, will be
preferred by the risk-lover investors.
Investment in Sectors: Strategy 4 Consideration for high return independent of
level of risk: Investors may think of combining the high-return, high-risk sector
(Finance) with the high-return, low-risk sector constituted of FMCG, MNC and
Pharmaceuticals. This combined group contains the ﬁrst four sectors in terms of
Sharpe ratio. The risk-averse investors are likely to prefer the portfolio because of
the high risk-adjusted return offered by it.

(constituted of FMCG, MNC and Pharmaceutical) with the low-return, low-risk
sector constituted of Energy, IT, PSE, and Services. The risk-averse investors are
likely to prefer the portfolio because of the low risk offered by it. However, a
closer look at the combined group might reveal that the high-return, low-risk group
will always dominate the low-return, low-risk group. This is because the ﬁrst
group contains the ﬁrst four sectors in terms of Sharpe ratio and has a lower level
of systematic risk. Hence, strategy 4 will always be dominated by the strategy 3.
Let us now consider the impact of ﬁnancial crisis on the investment strategies.
For the purpose, we need to compare the investment strategies in the pre- and post-
crisis period.
3.3.2 Portfolio Construction in NSE: 2005–2008
The NSE in the pre-crisis period is characterized by presence of three groups at the
sectoral level. The high-return, high-risk group, which is often preferred by
extreme risk lovers, is absent. The market is singled out as a high-return, low-risk
sector with a high and positive Sharpe Ratio (rank 4). Risk-averse investors might
ﬁnd the market index as a suitable place for investment (Table 3.5).
At the sectoral level, the low-return, high-risk sector namely PSU Bank is
hardly to be accepted by any. The extreme risk lover might go for it, but it seems
unusual. The low Sharpe Ratio for the sector might discourage the risk-averse

investor from investing in it. The low-return, low-risk group, with low systematic
risk might attract some pessimist investors. The low Sharpe ratios for the indi-
vidual sectors within the group might be a dispiriting factor.
Investment in Sectors: Strategy 1 Investment in the High return, low risk sector:
Risk-averse investors will always ﬁnd the sector attractive. The only uncomfort-
able factor will be the high systematic risk of the group.
Investment in Sectors: Strategy 2 Consideration for low risk independent of
level of return: Investors may think of combining the high-return, low-risk sector
(constituted of Commodity, Energy, Finance, Infrastructure and Services) with the
low-return, low-risk sector constituted of FMCG, IT, MNC, Pharmaceuticals and
PSE. The risk-averse investors are likely to prefer the portfolio because of the low
risk offered by it. However, a closer look at the combined group might reveal that
the high-return, low-risk group will always dominate the low-return, low risk
group. This is because the ﬁrst group contains the sectors with higher Sharpe
ratios. Hence, strategy 2 will always be dominated by the strategy 1.
The risk-lovers might ﬁnd it difﬁcult to single out suitable place for investment.
3.3.3 Portfolio Construction in NSE: 2008–2012
The NSE in the post-crisis period is characterized by presence of four groups at the
sectoral level in terms of the risk-return relationship. The market is singled out as a
low-return, low-risk sector with a negative Sharpe Ratio. Hence, it is unlikely for
the investors to choose the market index as a suitable place for investment
(Table 3.6).
At the sectoral level, the low-return, high-risk sector with negative return,
negative Sharpe ratio and high systematic risk will hardly be accepted by the
investors. Even the most optimistic, risk-loving person will be discouraged to
construct his/her portfolio with these sectors. The low-return, low-risk group with
low systematic risk will also not ﬁnd acceptability among investors. This is
because of their negative returns and negative Sharpe Ratios. Even the most
pessimist investor will avoid the group. The other strategies might be as follows:
Investment in Sectors: Strategy 1 Investment in the High return, high risk
sector: Risk-averse investors might ﬁnd the sector attractive due to its high Sharpe
ratio. However, this investment will be preferred by the risk-lovers.
Investment in Sectors: Strategy 2 Investment in the High return, low risk sector:
the group with very low systematic risk will be a must-pick-up for the risk-averse
investors. The choice is further justiﬁed by the high Sharpe Ratio ranking of the
constituent sectors (rank 1, 2 and 3 respectively).
Investment in Sectors: Strategy 3 Consideration for high return independent of
level of risk: Investors may think of combining the high-return, high-risk sector
66

Possible Investment Strategies in Indian Stock Market

(Finance and IT) with the high-return, low-risk sector constituted of FMCG, MNC
and Pharmaceuticals. This combined group contains the ﬁrst ﬁve sectors in terms
of Sharpe ratio. The risk-averse investors are likely to prefer the portfolio because
of the high risk-adjusted return offered by it. However, in terms of the systematic
risk and Sharpe ratio, the ﬁrst group has a slight edge over the second one. Hence,
strategy 3 might be dominated by strategy 2, particularly for some extremely risk-
averse investors.
Now we may consider the impact of ﬁnancial crisis on the investment strategies
in NSE. The pre-crisis period was characterized by the absence of high-return,
high-risk group. The risk-lovers had relatively fewer choices during the period.
The post-crisis period, however, is characterized by low, even negative returns of
some sectors making the choice much more limited. Just like the BSE market, IT
has transformed itself from a defensive one in the pre-crisis period to an aggressive
one in the post-crisis period. Financial sector has become riskier. FMCG, MNC,
pharmaceutical have emerged as proﬁtable places for investment, as their return
increased after the crisis. Sectors like Commodity, Infrastructure, Metal, PSU
bank, Energy, PSE, Services and the market index itself have been adversely
affected by the crisis. Their returns became negative after the crisis.
The study thus far has considered the possible investment strategies and port-
folio construction in the Indian stock market. Apart from the portfolio construc-
tion, the investors often struggle to decide on the optimum holding period for the
assets they hold. Often diversiﬁcation is a risk in itself: by diversifying across
more stocks one reduces the speciﬁc risks of holding individual stocks and become
more vulnerable to the market and economic conditions. Warren Buffet considers

diversiﬁcation as a return management platform, rather than a risk management
one. A rational investor should judge ﬁnancial assets on their merits and their price
and should change their allocations as circumstances change. They are to follow a
ﬂexible, opportunistic approach that would allow them to invest wherever the
expected returns are maximum. According to him, diversiﬁcation is nothing but a
protection against ignorance—‘‘it makes very little sense for those who know what
they’re doing’’. It is in this context that the importance of having some knowledge
of trading rule crops up.

Chapter 4
Investigation into Optimal Trading Rules
in Indian Stock Market
Abstract This chapter deals with momentum trading and possibility of a proﬁt-
able trading strategy in the Indian stock market. It does so by examining the
historical moving averages of the indexes. According to the trading rule, an
investor should buy when price is above some moving average of historical prices
and sell when price falls below some moving average. The study considers several
moving averages, short run, medium run, and long run, and explores whether the
general buy and sell strategies fare better than the holding strategy based on the
moving average. Existence of a momentum strategy would reafﬁrm the doubt that
the Indian stock market is not efﬁcient. It will put a question mark to the invin-
cibility of the market, as suggested by the efﬁcient market hypothesis.

4.1 Introduction
Efﬁciency of the ﬁnancial markets has long been a topic of hot discussion.
According to Fama’s (1970) efﬁcient market hypothesis, the ﬁnancial market is
inherently efﬁcient, that is, it reﬂects all available information. Therefore, it is
impossible to ‘‘beat’’ the market. In other words, it is impossible for an investor to
consistently achieve excess returns on a risk-adjusted basis, given the available
information. An efﬁcient market necessarily follows a random walk, or a mar-
tingale process. A market following random walk is necessarily impossible to
predict. Therefore, it goes perfectly hand-in-hand with the idea that an efﬁcient
market is unbeatable. The efﬁcient market hypothesis has been hugely popular

since its inception and many modern market models are based on this theory.
However, there has been a clear disagreement among economists regarding the
efﬁcacy of efﬁcient market hypothesis. Especially after the collapse of the ﬁnancial
market in 2007–2008, the validity of efﬁcient market hypothesis is largely at stake.
This study tries to examine the efﬁciency in Indian stock market by taking 13
sectoral stock indexes from Bombay Stock Exchange and 13 sectoral indexes from
National Stock Exchange. The objective of this chapter is to analyze the Indian
stock market and ﬁgure out a discernible trading rule, which is able to consistently
generate a positive return over time, thus ‘‘beating’’ the market. It will be done in
three stages. In the ﬁrst stage, we will try ﬁnd out the underlying trading rule for all
tradable indexes in Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE henceforth) and National Stock
Exchange (NSE henceforth). Stage 2 will test the efﬁcacy of the trading rule
against the economy’s performance. The concluding part of the study will test for
volatility contagion across the indexes.
4.2 Literature Review
There is a whole body of empirical research looking into the phenomenon of
efﬁcient market and its validity. The evidence suggests that a strongly efﬁcient
market is rare, however, most stock markets are largely semistrong efﬁcient. Now
this provides the investors with a scope to ‘‘beat’’ the market consistently. Basu
(1977) took return data for over 1,400 ﬁrms over a period 1956–1971 and con-
sidered the price earning ratio for all the ﬁrms and concluded that the market
behavior is not fully captured by the efﬁcient market hypothesis. The portfolios
with low price earning ratios consistently earned superior returns on a risk-
adjusted basis, thus making the efﬁcient market hypothesis invalid. Bondt and
Thaler (1985) discovered weak for market inefﬁciency in daily CRSP return data,
with a clear January effect. This month-of-year effect, 0 calendar effect has been
found to exist in stock market in several studies (Calendar effects) are cyclical
anomalies in returns, based on different times of year, month or week. Many
studies have shown that there is a signiﬁcant January effect present in many
markets. Not only month-of-year effect, calendar effect is witnessed as day of
week and even holiday effects are witnessed. Relevant papers include Lakonishok
and Smidt (1988), Hawawini and Keim (1995), and Mills and Coutts (1995). Lo
and Mackinley (1988) took weekly stock returns to test for efﬁciency. Their result
suggested that the stock market is inherently inefﬁcient and does not follow a
random walk. Ding et al. (1993) in their seminal study has shown that the stock
market (S&P500) is characterized by long-term memory. If a market exhibits long-
term memory, it means that when a shock is propagated into the system, it does not
get absorbed by the market instantly, as suggested by the efﬁcient market
hypothesis. But it persists into the system for a very long time before slowly
disappearing. This is directly in contrast to the efﬁcient market hypothesis. If the
market is inefﬁcient or even semi-strong efﬁcient, there may be ways to ‘‘beat’’ the
70

market, i.e., make consistent proﬁts from the market with a suitable buy-sell
strategy. The suitable strategy is often guided by looking at the moving averages of
the underlying stock. This is called momentum trading. The researchers did not
ﬁnd any suitable literature in momentum trading, as it is mostly applied in
businesses.
In recent past, there has been a whole body of literature on possible momentum
strategies in the market. Jagadeesh (1990), Lo and MacKinlay (1988), and Fama
and French (1988) showed that the market is characterized by negative correlation
among stock returns in the long run but positive correlation in the short run, which
implies that there is indeed a scope of proﬁtable momentum strategies in the short
run. Existence of positive autocorrelation among stocks in the short run and hence
relevance of momentum strategies is also documented by Jegadeesh and Titman
(1993, 1995). Lee and Swaminathan (2000) documented that momentum strategies
are successful in the US stock market. Rouwenhourst (1998) considered 20
emerging stock markets and found signiﬁcantly positive results when momentum
strategies are implemented in all countries. Hameed and Yuanto showed existence
of proﬁtable momentum strategies in some selected Asian stock markets. Success
of momentum strategies are also documented in the studies of Conrad and Kaul
(1998), Richards (1997), and Liu et al. (1999).
4.3 Objectives of the Chapter
1. To ﬁnd out an optimum trading rule for each index in Indian stock market (BSE
and NSE). This will give an insight into how the market can be ‘‘beaten’’. On a
more academic note, existence of a trading rule proves that the market is not
efﬁcient. The ramiﬁcation is, manifold.
2. Testing the efﬁcacy of the trading rule across regimes. In other words, whether
the same trading rule is applicable during a crisis as well. This will give the
investor an insight into whether to stick with the same trading rule when the
economy is under considerable economic stress.
The analysis will be done in three stages. The details are given below.
4.4 Dataset
This study will consider all 13 sectoral indexes from BSE, namely BSE CD, BSE
POWER, BSE CG, BSE FMCG, BSE TECK, BSE HC, BSE IT, BSE PSU, BSE
AUTO, BSE REALTY, BSE METAL, BSE BANKEX, and BSE OIL&GAS.
Also, this study will consider all 13 sectoral indexes from NSE, namely CNX
AUTO, CNX BANK, CNX ENERGY, CNX FINANCE, CNX FMCG, CNX IT,
CNX METALS, CNX MNC, CNX PHARMA, CNX PSU BANK, and S&P CNX

INDUSTRY. The period under the study would be from 2000 till 2011, the data
will be taken in a daily basis.
4.5 Finding the Optimum Trading Rule
In the next section, we continue with identifying possible moving average trading
rules. According to the trading rule, one buys when price is above some moving
average of historical prices and sell when price falls below some moving average.
Methodology
STEP 1 The variable underlying would be the daily return series [where
return = ln(Pt/Pt - 1)].
STEP 2 Next, short run, medium run, and long run moving averages are to be
constructed.
STEP 3 A general regression model will be constructed which will work as a
benchmark for a proﬁtability comparison with trading rule.
STEP 4 All possible combinations of short run, medium run, and long run signals
are constructed, such as buy37 (short run combinations); buy314, buy714 (short
run–medium run combination); buy330, buy360, buy730, and buy760 (short run–
long run combination); buy1430, buy1460, (medium run–long run combination);
and buy3060 (long run–long run combination). In reality, an inﬁnite number of
combinations can be generated but this study considers till 60 days which, in a
high frequency market such as stock market, is signiﬁcantly long run.
All the buying signals are dummy variable taking a value of 1 if the price is
above the nth day moving average of historical prices and zero otherwise.
STEP 5 Regress return on a constant and a lagged value of buy signal. The
estimated slope coefﬁcient will give the possible proﬁt. A signiﬁcantly positive
slope coefﬁcient, which is higher than the intercept as well as the coefﬁcient of the
general buy sell regression hints toward existence of a proﬁtable trading rule,
STEP 6 All possible buying signals (the set under consideration) are taken into
account and the signal with highest proﬁtability shows the optimum trading
strategy.
4.6 How the Trading Rule Varies Depending
on the Performance of the Economy
The study delves deeper and investigate whether and how the trading rule differs
signiﬁcantly when the economy is experiencing a crisis vis-à-vis when it is per-
forming well.
72

Investigation into Optimal Trading Rules in Indian Stock Market

STEP 1 We divide the whole time series into two periods for each index, namely
pre-crisis, and post-crisis period. For this study, we focus mainly on the recent
ﬁnancial crisis of 2008–2010.
STEP 2 Once we have two distinct periods or regimes, we will test for the
underlying trading rule for each regime. The target is to identify whether the
trading rule during a crisis vary signiﬁcantly during a time when the economy is
performing well.
There are, however, some limitations of this study. For example, (1) the bid—
ask spread is not considered, as the data is not available, (2) intraday or tick-by-
tick price, rather than daily price would have given a more accurate result, and (3)
possible idiosyncrasies may exist, as India is still an emerging market.
4.7 Finding the Optimum Trading Rule for BSE Indexes
Momentum, or in other words, positive serial correlation is a common phenom-
enon in ﬁnancial asset returns. According to www.Investopedia.com, ‘‘in
momentum trading, traders focus on stocks that are moving signiﬁcantly in one
direction on high volume. Momentum traders may hold their positions for a few
minutes, a couple of hours or even the entire length of the trading day, depending
on how quickly the stock moves and when it changes direction’’.1 As the main
objective of a momentum trader is to make proﬁt, it is very important from a
traders perspective to understand when to ride the momentum train and when to
get off it. The most common tool in ﬁnding this underlying trading rule is by using
the moving average (MA) method.
4.7.1 Visual Analysis of Autocorrelation
An inefﬁcient market is often characterized by long-term memory and traders
usually exploit this characteristic to their beneﬁt. Before we move into analyzing
the market trend and trading rules, it is beneﬁcial to examine if the underlying series
is characterized by long-term memory, or, in other words, whether a shock prop-
agated into the system remains within it for a long time or dies down very quickly.
One simple way to test it is checking for autocorrelations. Using the correlogram
function, the autocorrelations for each of the 12 return series are generated for 36
lags. Return, is deﬁned at Rt = ln(Pt/Pt - 1) where Pt is the price on t-th day.
Interestingly, even after 36 lags, the autocorrelations do not die down. They still
remain signiﬁcantly greater than zero. The autocorrelation functions are plotted
below, in Graphs 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 4.10, 4.11, and 4.12.

Based on the ACFs above, it can be said that all the return series are charac-
terized by long-term memory, that is, the autocorrelation decays very slowly over
a long time. Even after 36 lags, the autocorrelation does not fall to zero. The visual
representation above provides some degree of evidence in favor of the market
being inefﬁcient (Graph 4.13).
4.7.2 Trading Rule in BSE
The moving averages generated are buy3, buy7, buy14, buy21, buy30, buy60, and
all possible combinations of short run, medium run, and long run signals such as
buy37 (short run combinations); buy314, buy321, buy714, and buy721 (short run–
medium run combination); buy330, buy360, buy730, and buy760 (short run–long
run combination); buy1430, buy1460, buy2130, and buy2160 (medium run–
medium run combination); and buy3060 (long run–long run combination). Twenty
buying signals are also generated. The buying signals are a series of dummy
variables which takes a value of 1 when the price is above some speciﬁed
threshold and zero, when it is below. The buying signals generated are:
1. Buy3 = price [ Mov3, i.e., when the return is higher than the 3 days moving
average;
2. Buy7 = price [ Mov7, i.e., when the return is higher than the 7 days moving
average;
3. Buy14 = price [ Mov14, i.e., when the return is higher than the 14 days
moving average;
4. Buy30 = price [ Mov30, i.e., when the return is higher than the 30 days
moving average;
5. Buy60 = price [ Mov60, i.e., when the return is higher than the 60 days

4.7.2.1 Sector 1: BSE AUTO Trading Rule
The daily return of AUTO is regressed upon a constant and the result is sum-
marized in Table 4.1.
In the next step, lagging the buy rule signals by one period, several regression
equations are generated. They are

Each regression is estimated and the regression that gives highest daily return,
i.e., the coefﬁcient a, is considered. From above regressions, AUTO = -
c ? a3buy60(-1) gives the highest daily return. The coefﬁcient of BUY60(-1) is
0.0003. This means, when the investor is holding the fund, he is getting a daily
return of 0.0003 % and he will be making a loss of 0.0006 % when he is out. The

return, however, is small and not so much signiﬁcant, as seen from the high
probability values.
As it can be seen from Table 4.2 above, the proﬁtability of the trading rule is
lower than the general daily buy and hold return. This is seen from the fact that the
return from the general buy and sell regression is larger and more signiﬁcant than
the return on the best possible trading rule.

return. The result of the regression is summarized in Table 4.4. The coefﬁcient of
BUY60(-1) is 0.005 while the intercept coefﬁcient is -0.002. This means, when
the investor is holding the fund, he is getting a daily return of 0.0003 % and he will
be making a loss of 0.002 % when he is out. The return, is quite signiﬁcant as well,
as seen from the low probability values.
As compared to the general buy and hold pattern in Table 4.3, the trading rule
gives a larger return and this return is more statistically signiﬁcant as well.

means, when the investor is holding the fund, he is getting a daily return of
0.004 % and he will be making a loss of 0.001 % when he is out. The return from
the trading rule is statistically signiﬁcant as well (Table 4.6).
Comparing the return from the trading rule with the return from the general buy
and hold pattern, it can be said that the optimal trading rule is that the investor
must buy whenever the price is higher than the 60 days moving average and do not
hold whenever it is below the 60 days moving average.

making a smaller proﬁt of 0.000518 % when he is out. The return, however, is
small and not so much signiﬁcant (Table 4.8).
Therefore, the optimal trading rule is that the investor must buy whenever the

From above regressions, HC = c ? a3buy60(-1) gives the highest daily
return. The coefﬁcient of BUY60(-1) is 0.0023 and the intercept is -0.0006. This
means, when the investor is holding the fund, he is getting a daily return of

statistically signiﬁcant as well (Table 4.10).
By comparing the result from the trading rule with the result from the general
buy and hold pattern, it can be seen that the return from the trading rule is
signiﬁcantly higher than the return from the general buy and hold strategy. It can
be said that the optimal trading rule is that the investor must buy whenever the

From above regressions, AUTO = c ? a3buy60(-1) gives the highest daily
return. The coefﬁcient of BUY60(-1) is 0.003 and it is statistically signiﬁcant.
This means, when the investor is holding the fund, he is getting a daily return of
0.003 % and he will be making a loss of 0.002 % when he is out (Table 4.20).

Investigation into Optimal Trading Rules in Indian Stock Market

The optimal trading rule is clearly better in terms of return than the general
strategy. Therefore, the optimal trading rule is that the investor must buy whenever
the price is higher than the 60 days moving average and do not hold whenever it is
below the 60 days moving average.
4.7.2.11 Sector 11: BSE SENSEX Trading Rule
The daily return of SENSEX is regressed upon a constant and the result is sum-
marized in Table 4.21.
In the next step, lagging the buy rule signals by one period, several regression
equations are generated. They are

From above regressions, SENSEX = c ? a3buy60(-1) gives the highest daily

holding the fund, he is getting a daily return of 0.002 % and he will be making a
loss of 0.0005 % when he is out (Table 4.22).
Therefore, the optimal trading rule is that the investor must buy whenever the
price is higher than the 60 days moving average and do not hold whenever it is
below the 60 days moving average.

4.7.2.12 Sector 12: BSE TECK Trading Rule
The daily return of TECK is regressed upon a constant and the result is summa-

ð
Þ
From above regressions, TECK = c ? a3buy60(-1) gives the highest daily
return. The coefﬁcient of BUY60(-1) is 0.001. This means, when the investor is
holding the fund, he is getting a daily return of 0.001 % and he will be making a
loss of 0.00021 % when he is out. The return, however, is small and not so much
signiﬁcant, as seen from the probability values (Table 4.24).
Therefore, the optimal trading rule is that the investor must buy whenever the
price is higher than the 60 days moving average and do not hold whenever it is
below the 60 days moving average; however, the proﬁtability of the trading rule
from is not statistically signiﬁcant.
Looking at the results above from the study in context of the BSE stocks, one
clear pattern emerges. There is a signiﬁcant amount of inefﬁciency in the market
and there does exist a clear trading rule. For all 13 indexes, the most proﬁtable
trading rule emerges in the long run, to be more precise, a buy and sell strategy
based on a 60 day moving average is more proﬁtable than a general buy and sell
strategy for all indexes.

The analysis starts with the graphical representation of the autocorrelation pattern
embedded in each indexes. In the following diagrams, each ACF function is
plotted. A close look at the graphs reveal that, like BSE indexes, for NSE indexes
as well, the autocorrelation decays slowly and stays signiﬁcantly different from
zero even at long lags (Graphs 4.14, 4.15, 4.16 4.17, 4.18, 4.19, 4.20, 4.21, 4.22,

4.8.2 Trading Rule in NSE
4.8.2.1 Sector 1: NSE Consumption Trading Rule
The regression result for general buy and sell strategy is summarized in
Table 4.27.
The trading rule that returns the highest proﬁt is based on 60 days moving
average. The regression result for a 60 day trading rule is given in Table 4.28.
The coefﬁcient of BUY60(-1) is 0.0015. This implies, when the investor is
holding the fund, he is getting a daily return of 0.0015 % and he will be making a
loss of 0.00055 % when he is out. The return from the general buy and sell strategy
is 0.000361. The return from the trading rule is clearly better than the general
strategy. Therefore, the optimal trading rule is that the investor must buy whenever
the price is higher than the 60 days moving average and do not hold whenever it is
below the 60 days moving average.

whenever the price is higher than the 60 days moving average and do not hold
whenever it is below the 60 days moving average.

the general strategy. Therefore, the optimal trading rule is that the investor must
buy whenever the price is higher than the 60 days moving average and do not hold
whenever it is below the 60 days moving average.
So far, the analysis suggests the Indian stock market is quite risk averse in
nature, as the holding pattern of stocks is determined by a 60 day moving average,
that is a long run in stock market. The next section is devoted in the investigation of
the fact whether the market has become more risk averse after the recent crisis or it
was always like this. For this purpose, a similar methodology is applied before and
after the crisis in order to understand any discernible change in the trading rule.
4.9 Behavior of Indexes Before and After the Crisis
4.9.1 Behavior of NSE Indexes Before and After the Crisis
This section segments the return of NSE indexes before and after the ﬁnancial
crisis. The pre-crisis period is considered to be January 2005 to January 2008 and
the post-crisis period is considered to be February 2008 till September 2012.
4.9.1.1 Behavior of NSE Indexes in the Pre-Crisis Period
The results of the general buy and sell strategy for all the indexes are summarized
in Tables 4.51 and 4.52.
As the result above suggests, the 60 day trading rule is almost always more
proﬁtable for the investor, except for the case of NSE INFRA, where the general buy
and sell strategy is more proﬁtable. But the majority of the indexes show a clear
trading pattern, which is based on a 60 day moving average of the stock price.
In the next section, we analyze the pattern for the post-crisis period, starting
from February 2008 till September 2012.

Investigation into Optimal Trading Rules in Indian Stock Market

The post-crisis period behavior of the NSE indexes, surprisingly exhibit a
similar trading pattern. Except NSE IT, all other indexes have a clear trading rule,
that says when price goes above 60 day moving average, the investor should hold
to make proﬁt. Only for NSE IT, the general buy and sell strategy is applicable.
Let us now move on to consider the presence or otherwise of the trading rule in
Bombay Stock Exchange. A comparison between NSE and BSE would enable us
to get a comprehensive picture of the Indian stock market.
4.9.2 Behavior of BSE Indexes Before and After the Crisis
This section segments the return of BSE indexes before and after the ﬁnancial
crisis. The pre-crisis period is considered to be January 2005 to January 2008 and
the post-crisis period is considered to be February 2008 till September 2012.
4.9.2.1 Behavior of BSE Indexes in the Pre-Crisis Period
The general buying and selling rule for different sectoral and market indexes in the
BSE in the pre-crisis period is described in Table 4.55.
The trading strategies in BSE are shown in Table 4.56.
The result above suggests that except BSE OILGAS, all other indexes show a
clear pattern of proﬁtable trading policy. For each one of the indexes, except
OILGAS, the 60 day moving average presents a proﬁtable holding pattern than the
general buy and sells strategy.

4.9.2.2 Behavior of BSE Indexes in the Post-Crisis Period
The general buying and selling rule for different sectoral and market indexes in the
BSE in the post-crisis period is described in table 4.57.
The trading strategies in post-crisis BSE are shown in Table 4.58.
A look at the results from the post-crisis SENSEX indexes show that largely the
market exhibits a long term holding pattern. Out of the 12 indexes, only one index,
FMCG does not show a proﬁtable trading rule. Ten of the remaining eleven
indexes exhibit a proﬁtable trading rule based on a 60 day moving average and IT
shows a proﬁtable trading rule at 30 day moving average. Therefore, it can be
concluded that the Indian stock market is quite pessimistic and risk averse, because
even after the crisis, the trading pattern does not change much.

Behavior of Indexes Before and After the Crisis

4.10 The Optimal Trading Rule in India: The Epilogue
The present study has been an exploration into the possible presence of momentum
or speculative trading in Indian stock market. The momentum trading, as men-
tioned earlier generates speculative bubble that might lead to panic and a ﬁnancial
market crash. This study is an attempt to look for the presence of persistent trends
that could be fruitfully used by the investors along different stages of an economy.
Speciﬁcally, it inquires whether EMH could be put on trial during a ﬁnancial crisis
and whether it is the human psychology, in the form of speculation and irrational
exuberance, which drives or rather destabilizes a ﬁnancial market.
The Indian stock market has been characterized by some signiﬁcant latent
structures. The structure, however, differs across the stock exchanges chosen. The
Bombay Stock Exchange is characterized by a single structure where sectors and
market are closely connected. The trend in the post-crisis period is, however,
weaker than the ‘average’ (the trend for the entire period) market trend as well as
the trend in the pre-crisis period. The BSE is always characterized by signiﬁcant
volatility with volatility clustering and asymmetric response of volatility toward
good and bad news where volatility responds more toward bad news. The leverage
effect is less pronounced in the post-crisis period compared to that in the entire
period and in the pre-crisis period. The returns start falling and risks start mounting
as the market plunges into a crisis. BSE is mostly characterized by a positive risk-
return relationship. However, the correlation coefﬁcient between risk and return
starts declining and becomes negative as the market dips into crisis. The NSE is
characterized by the presence of two latent structures, where the closely associated
group of sectoral indexes dominates the market and is completely decoupled from
the market index. Otherwise, the trends are quite similar to those obtained for BSE.
Apart from the similarities in volatility trends and return cycles another trend is
easily perceptible in the Indian stock market irrespective of the choice of the
exchange. When the market experiences or passes through some ‘extra-ordinary’
events, some ‘unique’ or ‘special’ trend persists in the market. As the economy
reverts back to its ‘normal’ state this ‘special’ trend weakens in the sense that the
variability captured by the ﬁrst factor declines steadily. For investors, this infor-
mation might be extremely useful in designing proﬁtable trading strategy. To be
more speciﬁc, if it is possible to identify when this special trend would set in or
how long it would last, investors might be able to design strategies to make proﬁt
out of market movements. The movements in the ﬁrst factor Eigen value reveal
few more observations. The Eigen value increases during the periods of recovery
and reaches maximum just before the peak. During a stable period, however, the
Eigen value falls or reaches a plateau. Therefore, the ‘special’ trend persists during
the phases of recovery and weakens during the periods of recession or stability.
The market crash could be predicted from a high Eigen value of the ﬁrst factor and
high Eigen value could be associated with market crash. In Indian context, hence,
there is immense scope for the investors to use this piece of information to design
proﬁtable trading strategy in Bombay as well as the National Stock Exchange.

Investigation into Optimal Trading Rules in Indian Stock Market

As suggested by the portfolio construction rule, the risk-averse as well as risk-
lover investors could ﬁnd proﬁtable investment opportunities in the Indian stock
market. The choice of investment, however, has been much limited in the post-
crisis period. This is particularly because of the low and even negative returns
earned by many sectors in the post-crisis period. Signiﬁcant trends persist so far as
the nature of the sectors are concerned. While Metal and Consumer Goods sector
avoided the crisis as members of BSE, they have been hard hit by the crisis in
NSE. Pharmaceutical sector has emerged as proﬁtable places of investment in the
entire market as a whole after the crisis. FMCG and MNC are now offering
proﬁtable investment opportunity in NSE. FMCG, however, has lost proﬁtability
in BSE after crisis. Public Sector Units, Banks, Energy, Oil and Gas, Services, and
the market indexes have been worst-hit by the crisis. The crisis, however, has
transformed the defensive IT and the Financial Sector most aggressive.
Thus, the investors have immense scope in Indian market to design proﬁtable
investment strategies. The crisis, however, had signiﬁcant impact on the possible
portfolio construction. Deﬁnite trends exist in the market depending on the nature
of the cycle of economy that could be proﬁtably reaped by the investors. While the
presence of such trends and opportunities raises doubt about the validity of the
EMH in Indian context, the doubt might turn into belief if one looks at the long-
term holding pattern in the market.
The Indian market is characterized by the presence of a long-term holding
pattern. Almost all the indexes, irrespective of the choice of Exchanges, exhibit a
proﬁtable trading rule based on a 60 day moving average and IT shows a proﬁtable
trading rule at 30 day moving average. The trading pattern remains unaffected
even after the crisis. The Indian market is thus not very myopic. Rather, it is quite
pessimistic and risk averse.
Thus, Indian market, in the face of a global melt-down has been far from
efﬁcient. Deﬁnite trends and structures exist in the market that could be fruitfully
used by the investors. Moreover, the market is characterized by presence of
speculative trading and the crisis, in some cases had deﬁnite impacts on some
aspects of the market rendering the EMH useless. The analysis of momentum
trading, however, deserves special attention. The persistent presence of a sufﬁ-
ciently long holding period that is independent of the cycles of the economy
reveals an important fact about the Indian stock market. The market is vulnerable
on many counts: the EMH is on trial, the market is not ‘‘fundamentally stable’’,
and the market trends are strong enough to attract momentum traders in the
market. There is, however, one comfortable tone: it is perhaps not the human
psychology that drives the Indian ﬁnancial market. At least, it has been not so for
the last ﬁnancial melt-down of 2007–2008.
