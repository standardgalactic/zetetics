Creating molecules with tailored functionality requires understanding the intricate interplay 
between structure and interactions at the sub-molecular level. Here, we emulate the structure and 
orbital landscape of planar organic molecules using solely individual cesium ions atomically 
positioned on the surface of semiconducting indium antimonide. Using scanning tunneling 
microscopy and spectroscopy, combined with ab initio calculations, we show that an artificial 
atom can be derived from localized states created from a patterned cesium ring. The resultant 
nearly radially symmetric potential can then be used to couple artificial atoms, leading to 
bonding and antibonding orbitals as well as to different orbital symmetries. Based on these 
artificial orbitals, we emulate well-known organic molecules based on various constructed 
atomic structures, including anti-aromatic molecules, and characterize the resultant emulated 
molecular orbitals. This platform can be used to emulate molecular structures as well as monitor 
the interplay between structure and the orbital landscape with sub-molecular precision. 
 
One-Sentence Summary: Organic molecules are emulated solely based on the use of atomically 
positioned cesium ions on the surface of a semiconductor.

Designing materials with tailored physical and chemical properties requires a quantitative 
understanding of interacting quantum systems. In order to bring predictability to such complex 
interacting systems, a promising route is to create bottom-up platforms, where the electronic 
properties of individual and interacting atoms in solid-state materials can be emulated in a 
tunable manner. Such artificial lattice platforms have been realized with very different 
approaches (1-9), including cold atoms (1), optical lattices (6, 7), and twisted bilayer van der 
Waals materials (8, 9). Yet, these approaches have focused primarily on emulating the complex 
many-body quantum states that arise in solids, such as superconductivity, or exotic insulating 
states, based on creating lattices with translational symmetry. Orthogonal to this, an intriguing 
direction is to emulate quantum chemistry based on designing artificial molecular structures by 
tailoring the interacting atomic and molecular orbitals they are derived from (10). In this way, 
such an emulator based on tunable parameters may provide insight into molecular structures, as 
well as probe the interplay between the orbital landscape and geometry with a high degree of 
control. 
 
One approach toward this end is to emulate artificial atoms derived from patterned individual 
atoms on surfaces, based on scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS). The 
iconic example of an artificial atom was demonstrated by the quantum corral (11), where the 
constructive interference of scattered quasiparticles was used to derive the electronic states of a 
quantum dot. Based on such approaches, various artificial lattices on multiple surfaces have been 
created to emulate the band structure of Dirac and topological materials (5, 12, 13). Yet, this 
approach is based on using metallic surfaces, where the underlying delocalized electronic states 
strongly interact with the patterned atomic lattice leading to strong broadening of the electronic 

3 
¬†
states. This inherent interaction leads to energetic broadening of states that are larger than the 
typical coupling strength responsible for the formation of bonding/antibonding orbitals (13-15). 
Therefore, it is advantageous to emulate the properties of an individual artificial atom using 
weakly conducting surfaces, like semiconductors, where effective atomic states can be emulated 
and bonding/antibonding orbitals can be created (16-19). 
 
We illustrate, using quantum confinement, that bound states generated by patterned cesium (Cs) 
ions embedded in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) on the surface of indium antimonide 
(InSb) can be used to emulate quantum chemistry. Semiconducting InSb exhibits a band gap of 
235 meV (20). Upon adsorption on its (110) surface, Cs atoms resided at hollow sites of the Sb-
terminated surface (see Fig. S1) (21). Concomitantly, charge donation from Cs atoms leads to the 
formation of a dilute 2DEG near the InSb(110) surface, where the electric field of the Cs ions 
bends the conduction band below the Fermi energy (EF), leading to the 2D confinement potential 
(22-24). The manifestation of this 2DEG could be seen by a step-like onset in STS observed in 
the bulk band gap of the semiconductor (Fig. S3), with a carrier density of N2DEG = 2√ó1012 cm-2 
where each Cs ion donated approximately 0.4 electrons, depending on the Cs density and doping 
of the semiconductor (23).  
 
We exploited the ionic nature of individual Cs atoms and patterned these atoms into ring 
structures (Fig. 1B) in order to create potential energy landscapes that mimic the 1/r potential of 
an atom. The local concentration of Cs ions created an attractive potential for the electrons of the 
2DEG, leading to a bound state that could be visualized using STS (Fig. 1C). This bound state 

4 
¬†
typically occurred as a sharp peak, with full width at half maximum (FWHM) ‚âÉ 7 mV, within 
the bulk band gap, below the onset of the 2DEG as measured ~20 nm away from the structure. 
Using spatially dependent dI/dV imaging (see Supplementary Materials) at the peak energy (Fig. 
1D), which we refer to as an orbital map, it can be seen that this bound state was located within 
the structure but also symmetrically delocalized up to 9.0 ¬± 0.4 nm outside of the structure. The 
spatial delocalization of this wave function is a result of the interplay of the local band bending 
induced by the Cs-ring structure and the weak screening of the 2DEG. As a result, we could 
identify this bound state as an s-like atomic state stemming from the circular potential, and 
therefore we define this structure as an artificial atom. We observed that the formation of such a 
bound state is not particular to the use of eight atoms or a circular geometry, as used in Fig. 1, 
but can also occur for other geometries and number of atoms as we show later (see Fig. S8). 
While there were small deviations in the constructed structure from circular symmetry, these 
deviations led to negligible changes (e.g. anisotropy) in the electronic structure. This results 
since these spatial variations were small compared to the length scale of the wave function 
associated with the bound state. Namely, resultant potential is well approximated by a circularly 
symmetric 1/r potential at sufficient separation from the Cs-ring structure. The energy of the 
bound state was sensitive to a number of parameters, including the average Cs concentration, 
subsurface defects, as well as the distance to other Cs atoms.  
 
To quantify the localized charge density near the artificial atom related to the observed bound 
state, we solved the 2D Schr√∂dinger equation for electrons with an effective mass exposed to the 
potential created by the Cs-ring structure using parameters derived from density functional 
theory calculations (see Supplemental Materials). For the lowest bound state, we found a charge 

5 
¬†
density that was mostly confined within the structure but also contained a significant intensity 
outside the structure with a decaying tail (Fig. 1E,F). The presence of significant intensity 
outside of the structure can be attributed to the poor screening of the surface and is vital to allow 
molecule formation. This state was fully rotationally invariant and could thus be identified as an 
artificial orbital state with s character, which is comparable to the observed state (Fig. 1D). In 
addition to the s-state, the calculation also showed two excited states that were close in energy 
(209 meV and 214 meV above the ground state energy). These states showed px and py 
symmetries (see Fig. 1E). The degeneracy of these two states was lifted due to the broken 
rotational symmetry of the Cs-ring structure, arising due to the combination of the discreteness 
and symmetry of the underlying InSb lattice. The calculated results were qualitatively robust to 
variations of the involved parameters. For an isolated artificial atom, we did not experimentally 
observe these higher energy bound states as they presumably lie above EF in the conduction 
band. 
 
In order to tailor molecular orbitals, it is first necessary to demonstrate that these artificial atoms 
couple as well as exhibit orbitals with distinct symmetry (e.g. œÉ and œÄ character). We 
subsequently created coupled dimers by patterning two artificial atoms separated by d = 11 nm 
(Fig. 2A), where d is defined as the ring center-to-center distance. In Fig. 2B, we illustrate a 
false-color plot of spatially dependent STS taken at points along the line indicated in Fig. 2A. 
Unlike the case of the single artificial atom, Fig. 2B reveals two sharp low energy states, 
separated by an energy (Œîùê∏‡¨µ‡¨∂‡µåùëíŒîùëâ‡¨µ‡¨∂ = 46.0 ¬± 0.6 meV). While the lowest energy state was 
most strongly localized in between the two artificial atomic sites, the higher energy state 
exhibited a pronounced node with negligible intensity at the same location. This observation was 

6 
¬†
also consistent with orbital maps at these energies (see Fig. S9), indicating that these energy 
levels could be identified as bonding (œÉ) and antibonding (œÉ*) orbitals resulting from coupling 
between the two artificial atomic s orbitals (Fig. 1D). 
 
The coupling between artificial atoms was long range, namely could be observed for dimers 
separated by distances larger than the extent of the atomic wave function shown in Fig. 1F. We 
subsequently measured the bonding/antibonding spitting for different spacings d, as illustrated in 
Fig. 2C. We observed a clear monotonic decrease of Œîùê∏‡¨µ‡¨∂ with increasing d, with significant 
splitting measured up to values ùëë‡µé25 nm and residual splitting (indicated by a significantly 
broadened peak) observed up to 29 nm. Bonding/antibonding-like orbitals in coupled artificial 
structures have been observed on other surfaces with STM-based methods (13-18). Substrates 
based on metallic surfaces (13-15) exhibited bonding/antibonding splittings that were smaller 
than the width of these states (typically 10-50%). In this work, the splitting was much larger than 
the apparent width of the states themselves, similar to previous studies of In adatoms on 
InAs(111) (16-18). Compared to those examples, our data shows the bonding and antibonding 
peaks the sharpest with FWHM ‚âÉ 8 mV, and the underlying conduction band of InSb was 
unpinned. As a result, the states of the artificial atom were in the bulk band gap of the InSb, 
separated in energy from the bulk bands of the semiconductor, and also below the onset of the 
surrounding 2DEG. 
 
Before emulating molecular orbitals, it is necessary to emulate atomic orbitals with different 
symmetry, e.g. œÉ and œÄ orbitals. As discussed above (Fig. 1E), the separation in energy between s 

7 
¬†
orbital and p orbitals was most likely too large to observe in the dI/dV spectra for the structures 
discussed above, because the œÄ orbitals would reside in the conduction band of the InSb. 
Therefore, we fabricated a linear molecular structure composed of six artificial atoms, where 
each artificial atomic site is separated by d = 11 nm (Fig. 3A). Using dI/dV spectra along a line 
near the structure as input (see Fig. S10), more states separated by smaller energies were 
identified. A first hierarchy of states vs. energy could be seen, separated by a second hierarchy of 
states that are closer to EF. 
 
To illuminate the nature of these states, we acquired orbital maps of the ground state and the 
excited states (Fig. 3B-H, for a full set, see Fig. S11). The first hierarchy of six states found 
between VS = -126 mV and -66 mV (Fig. 3B-D) was a series of œÉ molecular orbitals derived 
from a superposition of the artificial atomic s orbitals. The spatial distribution of the orbitals 
followed textbook examples of the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO). The ground 
state (Fig. 3B) was a superposition with the same sign of all artificial atomic wave functions (see 
inset schematic), i.e. they all coupled in a bonding fashion. Successively, an increasing number 
of nodes was added, i.e., the second orbital (Fig. S11B) contained one node in the center of the 
chain, the third state (Fig. 3C) contained two nodes, and so on. The highest orbital of this 
hierarchy (Fig. 3D) contained five nodes due to alternating sign of the artificial atomic wave 
functions (indicated by red and blue colors in the inset, respectively)  
 
The second hierarchy of states starting from VS = -51 mV (Fig. 3E-H) was a series of molecular 
orbitals derived from a superposition of artificial atomic p orbitals. Fig. 3E shows a fully 

8 
¬†
bonding-type coupling of artificial atomic py states, leading to an artificial molecular œÄ orbital 
wih a node plane along the chain axis (see horizontal dashed black line) and increasing local 
density of states (LDOS) above and below the chain. The next œÄ orbital (Fig. 3F) contained a 
faint node in the middle of the chain (indicated by the vertical dashed line), which can be 
rationalized by a change of the phase of the artificial atomic py wave functions (see inset). This 
was followed by a third œÄ orbital with two nodes (Fig. 3G). While there should still be three more 
py-derived molecular orbitals at higher sample biases, we did not observe them, again 
presumably since those were located at energies where hybridization with the conduction band 
may weaken and broaden their LDOS. However, we found another œÉ orbital at Vs = -18 mV (Fig. 
3H) which perfectly resembled the LCAO of artificial atomic px orbitals with bonding character, 
leading to increased LDOS along the chain axis between each of the artificial atomic sites. We 
note that in almost all orbital maps the LDOS intensity was reduced at the ends of the linear 
artificial molecule. This is in accordance with expectations from molecular orbital theory (e.g. 
H√ºckel) where the coefficients for each atomic wave function in LCAO are modulated by a 
particle-in-a-box-like envelope function, reducing the total energy (referred to a delocalization 
energy) (25). Evidence for œÄ-like orbitals has previously been reported in an artificial structure 
based on In atoms on InAs(111) (19), albeit a full characterization using orbital maps would be 
important to distinguish the different artificial atomic p orbital symmetries as well as to provide 
evidence for their LCAO into molecular orbitals, as shown here. 
 
As a final step toward emulating molecular orbitals, it is necessary to illustrate that these 
artificial orbitals can hybridize. We therefore subsequently created a six-fold symmetric hexagon 
of artificial atoms, each composed of six Cs atoms, that resembles a benzene ring (Fig. 4A; see 

9 
¬†
Fig. S12 for details of the structure). We imaged the resultant orbital maps based on STS taken at 
various locations (Fig. S13). All relevant orbital maps found up to EF are illustrated in Fig. 4, 
where they are compared with the first eight calculated molecular orbitals of benzene (Fig. 4B), 
based on density functional theory (DFT) (see Supplementary Materials). The lowest state at Vs 
= -135 mV (Fig. 4C) was an orbital delocalized over the entire hexagonal structure, exhibiting no 
nodes and maximum LDOS intensity in the center of the hexagon. This is in very good 
agreement with the charge density of the calculated first molecular orbital (Fig. 4D). The next 
state at Vs = -103 mV exhibited maximal LDOS delocalized across a ring that connects all the 
artificial sites. In comparison to the calculations, the observed intensity was reminiscent of the 
superposition of the second and third molecular orbitals of benzene (Fig. 4F), which are 
degenerate. The next orbital map (Fig. 4G) had a similar geometry to the previous map (Fig. 4E), 
but the intensity was more delocalized toward the circumference of the artificial atomic sites, 
exhibiting a pronounced hexagonal symmetry. When comparing these calculations, this can be 
explained by a superposition of the degenerate fourth and fifth benzene orbitals (Fig. 4H). The 
map at Vs = -34 mV (Fig. 4I) displayed a more nodal pattern of six lobes with intensity toward 
the exterior of the artificial sites and a pronounced lobe in the center of the structure. This is 
different in the next map taken at Vs = -27 mV, where the lobes at each artificial atom were 
azimuthally more localized with node lines in between each site, while there was no LDOS at the 
center of the hexagon. Both the orbital maps in Fig. 4I and 4K agree with the sixth and seventh 
calculated orbital (Fig. 4J and 4L), respectively. Finally, Fig. 4M shows a map where LDOS was 
located between each of the artificial atoms, while nodes were present at each of them. This map 
is in partial agreement with the calculated eighth benzene orbital (Fig. 4N). There was also 
intensity in the center of the structure, which was not seen in the calculation. The overall strong 

10 
¬†
agreement between the orbital maps and the calculated orbitals provides evidence that the 
artificial atomic s, px and py orbitals have undergone sp2 hybridization to form artificial 
molecular orbitals.  
 
We subsequently focus on emulating molecular structures whose chemical analogues are 
difficult to synthesize or chemically unstable. Using artificial benzene as a basis, we constructed 
a structure comparable to the [3]triangulene molecule, which we refer to as triangulene in the 
subsequent discussion. This molecular structure consists of six fused benzene rings in a form of a 
triangle. No Kekul√© structure exists for triangulene (26), making it an antiaromatic diradical with 
a triplet ground state which is extremely reactive (27, 28). Only recently, the on-surface 
synthesis of unsubstituted monomers, dimers and chains has been achieved (29-31). 
 
In a similar fashion as for benzene, we built a structure made of 22 artificial atoms (Fig. 5A; see 
Fig. S16 for details of the structure) to resemble the molecular structure of triangulene (Fig. 5B). 
Due to its large nature, we observed a wider range of artificial molecular orbitals, with 
separations in energy smaller than in the discussed benzene structure (see Fig. S17). In Fig. 5, we 
present an excerpt of certain artificial molecular orbitals together with a comparison with the 
calculated molecular orbitals for triangulene (see Fig. S13 for a full set of all observed orbital 
maps). We found a very good agreement between the first five orbital maps (VS = -179 mV to -
100 mV) and the first twelve of the corresponding calculated molecular orbitals, as shown in Fig. 
5C-L. The further evolution of states at higher energies is visible in STS (Fig. S17). However, 
given the width (FWHM ‚âà 10-12 mV) of each state, maps at a particular voltage pick up 

11 
¬†
superpositions of an increasing number of orbitals (see Supplementary Materials), making an 
unambiguous assignment to states of triangulene difficult. Moreover, there is an anomalous 
orbital map taken at Vs = -18 mV where we found an intense resonance whose spatial distribution 
was rather different compared to the orbital maps close in energy (Fig. 5M). These orbital maps 
exhibited a strong LDOS intensity with triangular shape and no clear nodes in the central part of 
the structure. The feature resembles the calculated first pz-derived ÔÅ∞ÔÄ†orbital of triangulene (Fig. 
5N), which is also expected in this order. However, weaker intensity was also visible in the map 
along the periphery of the artificial structure. As we discuss later, based on the potential energy 
landscape in this system, it is not clear if out-of-plane orbitals that mimic typical LCAO-like 
character can be emulated.  
 
Finally, we present another example of an artificial structure (Fig. 6A; see Fig. S20 for details of 
the structure) that resembles the anti-aromatic molecule, cyclobutadiene (Fig. 6B) (32, 33). In its 
square shape, it is anti-aromatic, extremely reactive and thus far has not been isolated. When 
synthesized, the molecule reduces its four-fold symmetry to a rectangular structure by 
undergoing a Jahn-Teller distortion, thereby transforming from a triplet to a singlet state. Fig. 6A 
illustrates a square of four artificial atoms (each using a ring of eight Cs atoms) separated by d ‚âà 
11 nm. Based on STS taken at various locations along the structure (Fig. S21), we measured 
orbital maps of this artificial structure, and compared their spatial distributions with the 
calculated molecular orbitals of cyclobutadiene. The lowest energy state at Vs = -176 mV (Fig. 
6C) showed LDOS centered in the square and delocalized over all four artificial atoms, in 
agreement with the first orbital of cyclobutadiene (Fig. 6D). The second state showed a ring of 
LDOS with no intensity in the center of the square (Fig. 6E), also in agreement with a 

12 
¬†
superposition of the degenerate second and third orbitals of the molecule (Fig. 6F). The third 
state at Vs = -83 mV (Fig. 6G) showed LDOS located at the center of each artificial atom, but 
with intensity extending outward at 45 degrees with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes of 
the structure. This state can be identified as the fifth orbital of cyclobutadiene (Fig. 6H) of the 
DFT calculation. At Vs = -67 mV, we observed LDOS inside as well as a faint ring outside of the 
square structure (Fig. 6I). While this orbital map did not agree well with the cyclobutadiene 
orbital #4 as shown in Fig. 6J, we note that the four outer lobes have the same sign, which is why 
they fuse into a square-shaped ring when imaging the calculated orbital using smaller isosurface 
values. Still, the much smaller intensity of the ring vs. the central lobe in the experimental map 
cannot be explained this way. We speculate that this effect can be caused by the orbital coupling 
to the 2DEG, which would delocalize the density of states. Finally, the map at Vs = -49 mV (Fig. 
6K) showed LDOS concentrated in between the artificial atoms, in very good agreement with 
orbital #6 (Fig. 6L). The last two orbital maps similarly show that the LDOS extends laterally 
more outside the structure than at other energies. Therefore, it further supports our hypothesis 
that artificial molecular orbitals above the 2DEG onset couple to it. 
 
Discussion 
Looking at the spatial distribution of the bound state of single (Fig. 1) as well as the distance-
dependent level splitting of coupled artificial atoms (Fig. 2), we can approximate the potential at 
intermediate to large distances as 1/r potential in the xy- plane (see discussion below for the z 
direction). This long-range behavior was due to the poor screening of the substrate, owing to the 
low free carrier density. We note that the potential was tunable, because the free carrier density 
and hence the screening could be influenced by the surface Cs concentration. This is very 

13 
¬†
different from the In/InAs(111)-A platform, where the underlying 2DEG from which the 
artificial atomic states are derived is an intrinsic surface state with fixed carrier density that pins 
the Fermi level into the conduction band (16). Here, the reduced screening led to much more 
delocalized states that were not extremely sensitive to the exact configuration of the Cs atoms 
(Fig. S8), i.e. the artificial atomic bound state was radially isotropic at large distances from the 
artificial atomic structure. We note that very close to and inside the Cs-ring structure the 
underlying potential is not clear, and there may be additional electron-electron interactions that 
are significant. However, for the coupling of artificial atoms at the large distances presented 
here, only the isotropic long-range wave function outside the trap plays a role. From individual 
artificial atoms, it was not yet clear what the apparent filling is, i.e. how many electrons are 
bound, but this may be dictated by the number of Cs atoms used (see below). 
 
The simple LCAO picture applicable to the linear structure (Fig. 3) as well as the resemblance of 
the orbital maps for the various structures (Fig. 4-6) to actual organic molecules is uncanny. 
They provide evidence that the underlying radially isotropic potential of each artificial atom 
created not only s but also px and py orbitals that couple into molecular orbitals. Moreover, we 
found evidence for carbon-like sp2 hybridization in all structures with 120¬∞ angles between 
artificial atoms. Such bond angles make this type of hybridization more favorable. However, the 
hybridization is not necessarily driven by geometry alone. This was most obvious for the 
artificial cyclobutadiene structure, which exhibited a fourfold symmetry but still provided 
evidence for sp2 hybridization by comparison with the calculated orbitals of actual 
cyclobutadiene. This is different from previous studies based on confining surface states with 
particular orbital band character, where the geometry of the artificial structure determines the 

14 
¬†
spatial distributions and energies of the band modulations that mimic the s-, px- and py-like states 
(34, 35). 
 
Despite the astounding similarity of the orbital maps to those of organic molecules, it is 
important to be careful not to assign a particular element (e.g. carbon) to the artificial atoms in 
the given structure. This becomes clear when estimating how many electrons were actually 
bound to the artificial atoms and molecules. For artificial benzene, we identified six different 
states below EF, of which two are doubly degenerate. Hence, about 16 electrons should be 
trapped within the structure, which corresponds to about 2.7 electrons per artificial atom (or 
about 0.44 electrons per Cs atom). In comparison, each carbon atom in benzene provides four 
electrons from the 2s and 2p levels to form molecular orbitals. In a real molecule, the chemical 
(and hence electronic) structure is determined by this electron occupation of the chosen elements, 
and the exact splittings between the s, p etc. states. In our artificial molecular structures, we still 
achieved carbon-like sp2 hybridization despite a different filling by fixing the geometry. It 
remains unclear why also the artificial cyclobutadiene orbitals showed this hybridization. We 
note that we make similar estimates ranging from 0.4 to 0.5 electrons per Cs atom, also for the 
other molecular structures. 
 
Nevertheless, it is still surprising that we find a very good agreement with molecular orbitals, 
considering that we did not emulate the presence of additional artificial sites that would play the 
role of the hydrogen atoms in the artificial molecule. To this end, we also calculated the 
electronic structure of a C6 ring as well as a C4 ring without H (see Fig. S24 and S25). While the 

15 
¬†
spatial distributions of the calculated C6 molecular orbitals were found to be qualitatively 
identical to those of benzene, their energetic order is only the same for the first five orbitals but 
deviates from both benzene and the observations of our artificial structure (Fig. 4) for higher 
orbitals. At the moment, it is unclear why our artificial molecular orbitals are in better agreement 
with C6H6 and C4H4 rather than C6 and C4, respectively. This point is particularly important for 
cyclobutadiene, where the sp2 hybridization, despite the angular distortion, is stabilized by the 
hydrogen atoms bound to each carbon. The lack of additional artificial atoms that would take 
over the role of hydrogen in our structures might have also led to unhybridized orbitals (as we 
observed for the linear structure in Fig. 3), as the overlap of unhybridized px- and py-orbitals 
would also be large. More systematic studies that include varying bond angles and distances as 
well as coupling to the 2DEG may shed more light on how hybridization can be influenced. 
 
The cyclobutadiene case is furthermore particularly interesting as its theoretical description is 
non-trivial due to its multireference ground state (36) for which mean-field calculations, such as 
within DFT, can lead to inaccurate results. Thus, the deviation between the experimental and 
theoretical molecular orbital ordering might also be hint towards the shortcoming of DFT. Vice 
versa, this would mean that our theoretical atomic emulations might also allow for the prediction 
of correlation effects. 
 
An important point that is still unclear is whether the artificial molecules can also emulate out of 
plane ÔÅ∞ orbitals, which would be derived from artificial atomic pz orbitals. The potential energy 
generated from an artificial atom in the xy-plane mimics a 1/r potential at large distance from the 

16 
¬†
core of the artificial atom. However, in the z direction, the potential into the bulk of the InSb is to 
first approximation triangular-like due to the band bending of the conduction band (23), and not 
mirror symmetric at the vacuum interface. In other words, the potential landscape of an artificial 
atom is not spherically symmetric. This may have an influence on both the energies and the 
spatial distributions of any potential ÔÅ∞ orbitals, and requires further experiments to ascertain the 
interplay between the emulated orbitals and the quantization of charge density orthogonal to the 
surface. 
 
Conclusion 
In summary, we showed that artificial atoms can be created from Cs ions on the surface of 
InSb(110) and subsequently be used to emulate the molecular orbitals of different organic 
molecules. The physical system combining ions and a two-dimensional electron gas resembles 
the original proposal by J.J. Thomson (37), where one type of charge is embedded in a volume of 
the other. More specifically, the approach here¬†is based on the resultant bound states that are 
localized in energy and reside in the band gap of the semiconductor created by the attractive 
potential from the Cs ions. The coupling of the generated electronic states with the bulk is 
strongly suppressed, leading to charge densities that are spatially delocalized over distances 
much larger than an expected atomic wave function. This approach is distinctly different from 
previous studies of artificial lattices where utilized states are strongly coupled to the bulk (5, 11-
15, 34, 38), for example using scattered quasiparticles from patterned defects on metallic 
surfaces. It remains to be understood how to fully describe the electronic structure of the 
artificial atom, including the localized quasiparticles within the structure, any residual electron-
electron interactions, as well as the potential role of spin in these structures. Based on the ability 

17 
¬†
to finely tune the structure and concomitantly monitor the energy landscape, this platform can be 
used to study a vast number of planar molecular structures. For example, planar molecules that 
are chemically unstable can be emulated, as well as perturbations to molecular structures, such as 
transitions between cis/trans conformations. In addition, the local orbital resolution can be used 
to probe the electronic structure of carbon-based nanostructures, such as nanographene and 
graphene nanoribbons, and emulate exotic type of lattices (39). Finally, due to the relatively poor 
screening in this material and the low carrier density, this platform may also potentially be 
interesting to probe the effect of electron-electron interactions in artificial structures.

Materials and Methods 
 
All experiments were performed under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions with an 
Omicron low-temperature STM at a base temperature of 4.4 K. Electrochemically etched W 
tips cleaned by standard in situ procedures were covered with Au by means of dipping and 
further characterized on a clean Au(111) surface. Undoped InSb crystals were glued to 
sample holders using a conductive epoxy glue, with an additional stripe of glue along the 
edge of the crystal to ensure electrical contact to the surface and cleaved in UHV. After the 
sample was cooled down to the base temperature, Cs was evaporated from a Cs2CrO4 
dispenser (SAES getters) directly onto the cold surface. We used a typical surface coverage 
of 0.006 ML (ML defined based on adsorption site described below), as determined by 
counting individual atoms. Unless stated otherwise, STM topography images were acquired 
in constant-current mode with typical tunneling parameters of VS = 200 mV and It = 20 pA. 
Atomic manipulation was performed using lateral manipulation, with various types of tips 
treated on the surface, with typical tunneling parameters in the range of VS = 12 √∑ 20 mV and 
It = 50 √∑ 300 pA. 
 
Each STS spectrum was acquired after stabilizing the tip at VS = 50 mV, It = 100 pA. Unless 
stated otherwise, lock-in parameters were set to Vmod = 1 mVrms and between f = 667.1 -941.1 
Hz. Orbital maps were obtained by using a multi-pass method allowing a single line to be 
scanned multiple times with different parameters for each pass. Taking this approach was 
necessary to obtain a significant signal without moving the atoms. Here, the data was 
obtained in line-by-line fashion where initially one line of the structure‚Äôs contour was 
obtained in constant-current mode at the standard tunneling parameters (VS = 200 mV, It = 20 
pA), followed by a line with the same lateral and vertical coordinates (i.e. feedback loop 
turned off) where the dI/dV signal was registered at a particular voltage corresponding to 
specific energy derived from the STS spectra. Whenever needed, the signal strength was 
controlled by adding or subtracting a constant z offset. The process was repeated for each line 
of the image and for all the voltages of interest. All data has been processed using MATLAB 
and Gwyddion software. All orbital maps are filtered using a mean filter with a 2 px probing 
window, as well as with standard plane subtraction methods where necessary. 
 
Most parameters for the Schr√∂dinger equation used to calculate the ground and excited bound 
states of electrons in the eight Cs-ring structure on InSb(110) were obtained using density 
functional theory (DFT). To this end we construct a unit cell with an isolated Cs atom on a 
4x4 InSb(110) surface supercell consisting of 4.5 layers with 20 √Ö vacuum spacing and 
passivated dangling bonds at the bottom. All DFT calculations are performed within the 
generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE) (40) using projector augmented wave basis 
sets as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) (41). In these 
calculations we set the energy cutoff to 300 eV, the energy convergence criteria to 10-6 eV, 
and use 3x3x1 k-meshes for the Brillouin zone integrations. The effective mass m* ~ 0.02 me 
of the 2D electron gas is taken from experimental results (42). The total residing charge Z  
+0.8 at the Cs atom was estimated from a charge transfer analysis. This at the Cs position 
residing positive charge creates an effective potential which is screened by the InSb surface 
with dielectric constant Œµ = 8.4 and the 2D electron gas itself, which is considered via a 
Yukawa screening length Œª ~ 10 nm derived from comparison to experimental data. 
 
The partial charge densities of benzene C6H6, cyclobutadiene C4H4, triangulene C22H12, and 
artificial C6 and C4 molecules were obtained from DFT calculations of the isolated molecules 
with optimized geometries.

S1 - Determination of the Cs adsorption site on InSb(110) 
 
We started by identifying the sublattices of the InSb(110) substrate. According to Whitman et 
al. (21), the Sb and In sublattices have an ionic character and can be imaged via STM at -1.0 
V and 1.2 V, respectively. Fig. S1A and B clearly show that the sub-lattices were shifted with 
respect to each other by a half unit cell in horizontal direction, as expected. However, our 
STM images were typically obtained at positive bias voltages close to EF where the Sb 
sublattice was imaged (Fig. S1C). Fig. S1D shows that Cs atoms were always adsorbed in 
hollow sites of the Sb unit cell. 
 
For a theoretical assignment of the Cs adsorption site on the InSb(110) surface, we performed 
DFT calculations of isolated Cs atom on the surface of a 4√ó4 InSb(110) surface supercell 
using the experimental bulk lattice constant a = 6.479 √Ö and applied periodic boundary 
conditions. In z direction (perpendicular to the surface) we used 4.5 InSb layers and a vacuum 
spacing of 20 √Ö to reduce artificial interactions between the slabs. Dangling bonds at the 
bottom of the slab were passivated by pseudo-hydrogen atoms, as described in Ref. (43). The 
exact positions of the Cs adatom and the two uppermost layers of the InSb(110) substrate 
were optimized. This led to a corrugation of the surface, pushing the Sb atoms up and shifting 
the In atoms down, in agreement with STM data and previous computational results (42). 
Furthermore, the calculations confirmed that the experimentally identified adsorption site has 
the lowest energy (Fig. S2). 
 
S2 - Electronic structure of clean and Cs-covered InSb(110) 
 
The undoped InSb crystals are intrinsically n-doped. STS experiments revealed that the 
conduction band minimum (CBM) was typically about 50 meV above EF (Fig. S3A). The 
exact position of the onset of both valence and conduction bands can be identified more 
clearly in a semi-log plot. Upon Cs adsorption, a step-like feature with increased dI/dV 
intensity at higher voltages became visible in STS, which is a fingerprint of the two-
dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with a band onset at around VS = -90 mV (Fig. S3B).  
 
Bulk InSb is a semiconductor with a narrow band gap of about 230 meV (42). Within the slab 
geometry, the gap depends on the number of InSb(110) layers. On the DFT level it has been 
shown that 42 layers are needed to reproduce the experimental band gap (43), which was 
beyond the feasibility of our supercell calculations. For a reasonable balance between 
accuracy and computational feasibility, we used 4.5 layers (one layer marked with black lines 
in Fig. S2B) of InSb(110) (if not stated otherwise). Cs deposition yielded a charge transfer 
from the outer Cs 6s1 shell to the InSb(110) surface, which effectively dopes the lowest 
conduction band of InSb(110). We identified this partially occupied lowest band as the origin 
of the 2DEG (42), which has a parabolic dispersion E(k) = (ƒßk)2/(2m*) centered at the Œì‡¥§ point 
(Fig. S3). The effective mass m* depends on the doping concentration and varies within the 
range 0.014 ‚Äì 0.02 me (42). Our 4√ó4 surface supercell with one Cs atom and 4.5 layers of 
InSb(110) corresponds to a large doping concentration, with effective masses between ùëö‡Ø´·à∫‡Ø¨·àª
‚àó
 
‚âÉ 0.04 me (0.08 me). Note that the effective mass of this band is also affected by the number 
of involved InSb(110) layers (Fig. S4).

We calculated the transferred charge density Œ¥œÅ as the difference between the charge densities 
of the full supercell Cs/InSb(110), the pure substrate InSb(110), and the isolated Cs atom 
according to: 
Œ¥‡Æ°‡µå œÅ‡Øô‡Ø®‡Øü‡Øü ‚Äì œÅ‡ØÇ‡Ø°‡Øå‡Øï ‚Äì œÅ‡Æº‡Ø¶ 
S1 
From this we found that the transferred charge is mostly confined to the InSb(110) surface 
near the Cs impurity (Fig. S5). To analyze the total transferred charge from the Cs adatoms to 
the InSb(110) surface we integrated Œ¥œÅ(r) outside a sphere of Rc centered on the Cs atom. The 
result is depicted in Fig. S5 and shows a maximum of about 0.22 electrons far away from the 
impurity atom. This demonstrates a strong delocalized behavior similar to the 2DEG. 
Additionally, we performed a Bader charge analysis resulting in an approximate total charge 
of Cs equals to 0.82, which suggests that 0.18 of the 6s1 electron density has been transferred 
to the InSb surface (Fig. S6). Both of these values are thus in reasonable agreement with the 
experimental estimate of about 0.4.

where ri the ith Cs atom position in the Cs-ring structure as used in the experiments. We set Z 
= 0.8, based on our Bader charge analysis, and the experimental dielectric constant (44) is set 
to InSb Œµ = 16.8/2, where the factor of 2 is effectively accounting for the surface geometry. 
The experimental effective mass m* = 0.02 me was used in our simulations (42). The Yukawa 
screening length Œª = 10 nm is fitted to the experimental data.  
 
In the ground state we find a radially symmetric charge density with no nodal planes located, 
which mostly reside inside the structure but also contained a significant intensity outside the 
structure with a decaying tail, which can be identified as a s state. Two excited states at 209 
meV and 214 meV have px and py spatial distributions, respectively, extending far outside of 
the cluster (see main text, Fig. 1E). The degeneracy is lifted due to the broken symmetry of 
Cs-ring structure. Overall, the ground state charge density is in good agreement with the 
experimental data (Fig. S7). 
 
Variations of the screening length Œª in the Yukawa potential (Eq. S3) modify the shape of the 
charge density. The charge densities obtained with smaller Œª is in better agreement with the 
experimental data inside the structure, however, larger Œª are required for a better agreement 
outside the cluster. Larger effective masses m* as well as larger Z in the Yukawa potential 
result in more localized charge density distributions. All calculated energies of the ground 
and excited states are given in Table 1. 
 
S4 - Examples of different Cs structures 
 

6 
¬†
We built two nearly symmetric structures representing an artificial atom: nearly hexagonal 
consisting of six Cs atoms and nearly circular rings consisting of eight Cs atoms, displayed in 
the structural models and STM images in Fig. S8A,B and D,E, respectively. Here, nearly 
refers to the fact that the Cs atoms can only be manipulated to hollow adsorption sites of the 
InSb(110) lattice (see Section S1), hence the rectangular surface unit cell (lattice constants 
4.58 √Ö along x and 6.48 √Ö along y direction) only permits discretized patterns. Both 
structures exhibited a localized resonance state is STS as presented in Fig. S8C and F, 
respectively. Compared to the 8-Cs ring structure, the bound state of the 6-Cs hexagonal 
structure was shifted toward the Fermi level, to VS = -79 mV. It also displayed lower intensity 
and increased width, which indicates a slightly increased coupling to the surrounding 2DEG. 
 
S5 - Differential conductance maps of two coupled artificial atoms 
 
STS spectra of two coupled artificial atoms showed two states, as presented in Fig. 2B. The 
first state was located at V1 = -133 mV with maximum dI/dV intensity between the artificial 
atoms. The second state was found at V2 = -86 mV with dI/dV intensity at the artificial atomic 
sites and no intensity in between. To confirm that these states can be identified as bonding 
and antibonding orbitals derived from the LCAO of the artificial atomic s orbitals, we 
performed orbital maps taken at the two peak energies, shown in Fig. S9. These clearly 
reflected the LDOS distribution expected for s-derived bonding (œÉ) and antibonding (œÉ*) 
orbitals with an antinode and a node between the artificial atoms, respectively. 
 
S6 - Linear chain composed of six artificial atoms 
 
Figure S10 shows a constant-current STM image of the same linear chain composed of six 
artificial atoms (Cs-ring structure) presented in Fig. 3. To identify resonances, we measured 
dI/dV spectra at each point along a scanline above the structure, as shown by the dashed line 
in Fig. S10A. Each point spectra were stabilized individually with the same stabilization 
parameters (VS = 50 mV, It = 100 pA). In Fig. S10C, the resulting dI/dV intensity is plotted in 
a false-color scale as a function of position and voltage (similar to the plot presented for the 
dimer in Fig. 2B). In order to also identify resonances that have increased LDOS further 
away from the central axis of the chain, as to be expected for œÄ orbitals, we repeated the 
measurement along a scanline that is further displaced in y direction, as shown in Fig. S10B. 
The resulting set of dI/dV spectra is shown in Fig. S10D. A wide range of resonances could 
be identified in these spatially resolved dI/dV spectra and subsequently imaged as an orbital 
map (Fig. S11). For instance, between VS = -130 mV and -60 mV, we found resonances with 
LDOS distributions following a particle-in-a-box behavior, starting with a state at VS = -126 
mV that has no nodes. The next resonance at VS = -118 mV contained one node in the middle 
of the chain, followed by resonances with two (VS = -106 mV), three (VS = -91 mV), four (VS 
= -79 mV), and five (VS = -66 mV) nodes. Orbital maps taken at these voltages (Fig. S11) 
confirmed that these resonances could be identified as œÉ molecular orbitals derived from a 
LCAO of s orbitals of the artificial atoms. 
 
In the range VS = -60 mV to -30 mV, the spectra in Fig. S10C shows an apparent gap when 
measured near the chain. But looking at spectra obtained at a further distance orthogonal to 
the chain axis (Fig. S10D), this region contains three resonances. Orbital maps at these three 
energies (VS = -51 mV, -42 mV and -30 mV) are shown in Fig. 3E-G and repeated in Fig. 
S11. We have identified them as the first three œÄ molecular orbitals derived from a LCAO of 
py orbitals of the artificial atoms, again containing an increasing number of nodes with 
increasing energy, as highlighted by dashed lines in Fig. 3. 

7 
¬†
 
Another strong resonance was also identified at VS = -18 mV, which we assigned to the first 
molecular orbital derived from a bonding LCAO of px orbitals of the artificial atoms, leading 
to increased LDOS in between the six artificial atomic sites as well as outside of the two 
outer sites. Fig. S10 shows that the dI/dV intensity showed additional dispersive behavior at 
even larger voltages, with distinct LDOS distributions. However, in this energy range the 
spectral features are washed out, presumably due to an increase of coupling to the 2DEG as 
well as incipient coupling to the bulk conduction band with increasing voltage. 
 
S7 - Artificial benzene structure and DFT results of benzene molecule 
 
Fig. S12 presents a structural model of the artificial benzene molecule consisting of six 
artificial atoms, where each artificial atom was Cs-hexagonal structure. We note that owing 
to the discretization of the possible positions of Cs atoms on the InSb(110) lattice (see 
Section S4), there is a slight deviation from the perfect hexagonal symmetry. However, the 
difference in bond lengths of less than 0.2 √Ö is negligible compared to the spatial extension 
of the artificial atomic wave functions (see Fig. 1F and Fig. S7). 
 
Fig. 13A shows an STM image of the artificial benzene structure, including two points and a 
dashed line that mark positions where we measured dI/dV spectra (shown in Fig. 13B,C) to 
identify resonances for orbital maps. Fig. S14 presents orbital maps at all voltages below the 
Fermi level where a peak was observed in one of the dI/dV spectra. Most of these maps are 
the same as already presented in Fig. 4. In addition, we also found a faint resonance at about 
VS = -51 mV localized in the center of the artificial benzene ring. This map could not be 
assigned to a particular orbital of benzene. We speculate that this may be a signature of the 
underlying 2DEG. As already discussed for the linear six-site chain in the previous section, 
we found additional dispersive behavior with distinct LDOS distributions above the Fermi 
level, as shown in the last three orbital maps in Fig. S13. Especially the map at VS = 50 mV is 
reminiscent of standing wave patterns as known from 2DEG quasiparticle interference, 
indicating a coupling to the 2DEG or even the bulk conduction band. For this reason, we 
refrain from interpreting maps above the Fermi level in terms of artificial molecular orbitals 
(Fig. S14). 
 
For more detailed comparison of the experimental orbital maps of the artificial structure with 
the actual benzene molecule, we show all DFT-calculated occupied benzene molecular 
orbitals in Fig. S15. Note that degenerate orbitals are presented separately, while 
superpositions were presented in Fig. 4, as the latter is what is expected to be visible in the 
experiments.  
 
S8 ‚Äì Artificial triangulene structure and DFT results of triangulene molecule 
 
Figure S16 presents the structural model of the artificial triangulene structure made from 22 
artificial atoms, where each artificial atom was Cs hexagonal structure. The artificial benzene 
structure shown in the previous section served as the building block. Again, in order to 
identify voltages of interest where a molecular resonance state might be, we performed dI/dV 
spectra along various lines and points of the structure, some of which are presented in Fig. 
S17. The number of resonances within the probed energy window strongly increased 
compared to the smaller artificial structures. We note that at these small voltage separations, 
some resonances also overlapped within their widths. Therefore, it was not possible to 
acquire orbital maps at discrete energy separations due to the overlapping resonances, but the 

8 
¬†
dI/dV maps rather represent linear combinations. Consequently, it becomes more difficult to 
compare the experimental maps with the calculated orbitals of the triangulene molecule. 
 
Fig. S18 summarizes all orbital maps taken in a range from -200 to +50 mV. The upper row 
of maps is also shown in Fig. 5, where they were compared with and assigned to (mostly 
superpositions of) the first twelve DFT-calculated orbitals of the triangulene molecule.  
 
Fig. S19 shows the first 30 orbitals of triangulene from the DFT calculations. Here, we also 
show degenerate orbitals separately. Further comparison with the additional orbital maps in 
Fig. S18 is possible but becomes increasingly more difficult with increasing energy. 
Nevertheless, we can try to identify major features. The maps at VS = -96 mV and -92 mV 
showed features that are reminiscent of the degenerate orbitals #13-15. The map at VS = -83 
mV showed only weak dI/dV intensity but it resembles the orbital #16. The map at VS = -74 
mV displayed a noticeable roughly triangular shape with an intensity at the center artificial 
atom of the structure. A LDOS distribution with the same features can also be seen in orbital 
#17 while the outer intensity is captured in orbitals #18-19. The map at VS = -62 mV featured 
strong intensities located within outermost hexagonal rings. This feature can be partially 
explained by the orbitals #20-21. 
 
For a comparison to the calculations, the maps from VS = -55 mV to VS = -25 mV might be 
considered as a gradual transition between characteristic features found in the orbitals #22-
27. The resonances were so close in energy that disentangling the characteristic features of 
each and assigning a specific orbital is not possible. Finally, the maps at VS = -18 mV and -8 
mV show a central triangular feature reminiscent of orbital #28, which is the first pz-derived œÄ 
orbital of triangulene. Further strong resonances with distinct spatial distributions appear 
above the Fermi level, but due to the reasons mentioned before, we refrain from any further 
assignments to actual molecular orbitals of triangulene. 
 
S9 - Artificial cyclobutadiene structure 
 
Fig. S20 illustrates the structural model of the artificial cyclobutadiene molecule consisting of 
four artificial atoms, where each artificial atom is Cs ring structure. In order to identify the 
energies of interest where a molecular resonance state might be, we performed dI/dV spectra 
along various lines and points of the structure, some of which are presented in Fig. S21. Fig. 
S22 presents orbital maps at all voltages below the Fermi level where a peak was observed in 
one of the dI/dV spectra. Most of these maps are the same as already presented in Fig. 6. 
 
For a more detailed comparison of the experimental orbital maps of the artificial structure 
with the actual cyclobutadiene molecule, we show all DFT-calculated occupied benzene 
molecular orbitals in Fig. S23. The degenerate orbitals are presented separately, while 
superpositions were presented in Fig. 6, as the latter is what is expected to be visible in the 
experiments.  
 
S10 - Comparison of calculated orbitals for molecules with and without H termination 
 
Figures S24 and S25 present a comparison between two hexagonal and two square molecules. 
For each comparison one of the molecules contains hydrogen terminations while the other 
does not. The molecules with hydrogen terminations are the same as presented before, i.e. 
benzene and cyclobutadiene. For each molecule, we present the first 10 molecular orbitals. 

9 
¬†
We note that for both of these comparisons the shapes of the orbitals were comparable, but 
their energy ordering changed. 
 
For the C6H6 to C6 comparison (Fig. S24) there is an agreement for the first five orbitals. The 
shape of the orbital #6 of C6H6 is similar to the orbital #7 of C6. At the same time, the orbital 
#6 of the C6 can be compared to the orbital #8 of the C6H6. We note that in this comparison 
an equivalent of the C6H6 orbital #7 cannot be found. For the C6 molecule, the orbitals #8-10 
are œÄ-orbitals and equivalents of those for C6H6 can be found at higher energies than the ones 
presented here. 
 
For the case of C4H4 to C4 comparison (Fig. S25) there is an agreement for the first three and 
the last three orbitals. The shape of the C4H4 orbital #4 can be compared to the C4 orbital #6 . 
The C4H4 orbital #5 is similar to the C4 orbital #7. The C4H4 orbital #6 resembles the C4 
orbital #4. Finally, the out-of-plane œÄ-orbitals can be found as #7 and #5 for the C4H4 and C4 
molecule, respectively.
