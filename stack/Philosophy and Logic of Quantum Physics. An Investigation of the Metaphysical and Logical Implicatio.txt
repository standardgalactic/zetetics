The book investigates the ontology and logic of quantum physics. The first 
part discusses the relationship of theory and observation and different views 
on the ontological status of scientific theories. It introduces the fundamen-
tals of quantum mechanics and some of its interpretations and their com-
patibility with various ontological positions. In the second part, implications 
of quantum mechanics on classical logic, especially on the distributive law 
and bivalence, as discussed by Garrett Birkhoff & John von Neumann (1936) 
and Hilary Putnam (1968), and their counterarguments are reconstructed 
and discussed. It is concluded that classical logic is sufficient for dealing 
with quantum mechanical propositions.

Joint Foreword 
(by Jan Philipp Dapprich and Annika Schuster)
The evidence and background theory of quantum mechanics have raised 
questions among both physicists and philosophers resulting on the one hand 
in several interpretations of the theory and on the other hand in logical sys-
tems which are to reflect its unique structure. Its radical consequences such 
as indeterminism with regard to measurable, but incompatible, quantities 
and value indefiniteness provided philosophers with empirical evidence for 
arguments against realism and classical logic. In the two parts of this book 
we provide an overview over the interpretations of quantum mechanics as 
well as some of the quantum logical arguments and investigate the implica-
tions of quantum mechanics on ontology and classical logic.
The book is designed for readers without background knowledge in nei-
ther quantum mechanics nor logic and ontology. Each part begins with an 
introduction covering the phenomena needed for our philosophical analysis. 
But it surely would go beyond the scope of this book to review all the details 
in all the disciplines, which is why it will probably be more accessible with 
some foundations in these areas. 
The two parts of this book can be read independent from each other as 
they are based on our Master’s resp. Bachelor’s thesis which we handed in 
at the Heinrich-Heine-University Düsseldorf.
The first part by Jan Philipp Dapprich is called “Theory and Observation 
in Quantum Physics”. It is divided into three parts. The first part gives an in-
troduction to the relationship between theory and observation and proposes 
a classification of terms and sentences. Then it discusses the theory depend-
ence of observation and observational language and provides an overview 
of the various standpoints with regard to the ontological status of scientific 
theories. The second part introduces the aspects and interpretations of 
quantum mechanics relevant to the philosophical analysis in the third part. 
Three fundamental questions are discussed as part of this analysis: a) what 
kind of relationship there is between theory and observation in quantum 
mechanics, b) whether quantum mechanics is an acceptable theory, and c) 
which ontological status can be assigned to quantum mechanics.

12
The second part by Annika Schuster is called “Quantum Logic” and 
is divided into three chapters. The first chapter comprises a review of the 
fundamentals of classical logic and quantum mechanics necessary for the 
philosophical analysis. The second chapter discusses arguments for the 
invalidity of the distributive law in quantum logic based on quantum-
mechanical considerations and their defeaters. The third chapter examines 
Hilary Putnam’s approach to quantum logic and the implications regarding 
meaning and bivalence which he derived from his approach more closely.
Although the two parts of the book were written independently, our 
conclusions are in a way similar: We both concluded that there seems to 
be no need to introduce a new ontology or logic in the light of the findings 
of quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics seems to be compatible both 
with a classical ontology and classical logic.

Part 1: Theory and Observation in 
Quantum Physics

1.  Introduction
Quantum physics constitutes one of the major developments in physics 
during the 20th century and remains current to this day. Ever since the first 
advancements by the early pioneers of quantum mechanics, it has been the 
subject of great controversy, often touching on questions of philosophy. 
Here we will pay particular attention to the relevance of discussions in 
philosophy regarding the concepts of theory and observation to quantum 
physics.
The first part will introduce a classification of theoretical and observa-
tional terms and sentences following Schurz (2013), and will discuss vari-
ous problems regarding theory and observation. In particular, we will try 
to understand the age-old discussion between realism and anti-realism as 
a question of the reference of theory. We will dismiss several ontological 
positions and lay out some cornerstones for a new radical empiricist view.
The second part will introduce quantum mechanics for those readers 
not familiar with it, in simple terms. We will notice some of the differences 
to classical physics, and discuss some of the empirical phenomena that led 
to quantum physics as well as the core ideas used to explain them. Further 
on, we will discuss some of the many interpretations of quantum physics 
out there and the problem they are trying to solve.
In the final part, we will use the philosophical foundations laid in part 1 
to reflect on quantum physics. We will discuss various issues regarding the 
theoretical structure and observation of quantum physics, as well as asking 
whether quantum physics is an acceptable viewpoint from a philosophical 
perspective, and discuss how the different interpretations can be understood 
ontologically. We will also argue that a sensible ontological position may be 
relevant for the success of further research in modern physics, in particular 
the development of a quantum theory of gravity.

Part I.  Theory and Observation
This part will lay the philosophical foundations for our discussion of quan-
tum physics. After some opening remarks on the relationship between 
theory and observation, we will introduce a formal classification of terms 
and statements. In this context, we will discuss the relevance of ostensive 
learning to distinguish observational from theoretical language. Next we 
will discuss various arguments concerning an asserted dependence of obser-
vation on theory. The final section is dedicated to the discussion of various 
ontological positions. We will propose some key aspects on which to build 
a modern radical empiricism.
2.  The Relationship between Theory and Observation
One of the first logical positivists to distinguish clearly between theory 
and observation was Moritz Schlick, in his General Theory of Knowledge 
(1918). He argued that scientific theories consist of an observational part 
and a theoretical part. Theoretical terms gain their meaning from the role 
they play in theories. The theoretical and observational parts are linked 
through a correlation between theoretical and observational terms.
The logical positivists had different viewpoints on the exact nature of the 
separation of theory and observation, some of them changing their minds 
several times. What many of these viewpoints seem to have in common 
though, is that observation is considered a certain basis for knowledge, since 
it is seen as directly accessible through what might be called introspection. 
Scientific theories could then be used to explain past observations and also 
predict future ones. This also serves as a method of establishing empirical 
justification for a theory. An explicit formulation of this would later be 
known as the deductive-nomological model.
An alternative view point to that of Schlick, was made popular by Rudolf 
Carnap’s Aufbau (Carnap 1979). All theoretical terms are to be constructed 
from an observational basis. Theoretical terms can be defined through:
(a)	 observational terms
(b)	 logical and mathematical terms
(c)	 already well-defined theoretical terms

18
Theory can thus be seen as simply observation enriched with mathematics 
and logic.
Later views started to question whether theory could be traced back to 
observation through such definitions. The idea of a correlation between 
theoretical parts and observational parts was reintroduced (cf. Uebel 2011, 
section 3.4). We will tie in with this idea.
One important consequence of not defining theory through observation, 
is that the two are logically completely separate. It is impossible to deduce 
an observational statement from purely theoretical axioms. The same holds 
true the other way around. A connection between the two is only estab-
lished by mapping certain theoretical statements with certain observational 
statements. This mapping can be expressed in the form theoretical sentence 
“x” corresponds to observational sentence “y”. A more complex correlation 
is, however, also possible. What we mean by this is that it is not necessary 
to map every theoretical sentence to an observational sentence individually, 
but rather to establish certain general rules from which such individual 
mappings can be deduced.
There must also be a mapping between observational sentences and ob-
servations, and for realists a mapping between some theoretical statements 
and states of reality. The problem here is that observations are not sentences 
and the linguistic representation of sentences is precisely what we are try-
ing to link to it. So, the correspondence between observational statements 
and observations cannot itself be expressed as a statement in the form “x” 
corresponds to “y”, because y is not a statement. A similar argument is 
to be made for theoretical statements and states of reality. Any linguistic 
representation of reality is already a theoretical statement.
That such a correspondence cannot be expressed through language 
doesn’t necessarily mean it can’t be learned. In section 3.1.1 we will intro-
duce the concept of ostensive learning. We believe that the correspondence 
between observational sentences and observation can be learned in such a 
way. The link between theoretical statements and states of reality will be 
discussed further in section 5, which is dedicated to the question of ontology.
The role of scientific theories in our view is to yield, through deduc-
tion, some theoretical statements which are linked to observational state-
ments through a mapping as we discussed. In physics this may be through 

19
prediction of a certain ‘state’ of a physical system. This state can then be 
linked to some observational sentence.
Of course usually this link will not be direct. What observation is made 
depends on how the state is measured or observed. Generally this is done 
by means of some measuring apparatus. We can, however, describe the state 
of the apparatus being caused by a certain physical state using theoretical 
language as well. The apparatus will have some sort of display, whose 
state will be included in the state of the apparatus, e.g. a computer screen. 
Naturally the state of the computer screen doesn’t tell us anything about 
whether we are looking at it, in what angle we are doing so, and so forth. 
This problem could be solved by adding the light emitted by the screen, 
which reaches our retina into the description. After that, we could also 
add the state of our brain caused by it, because our conscious response 
to the light may depend on psychological and neurological factors. In the 
end, what we’d actually be mapping to observational statements would be 
physical states of our brain, or possibly other parts of the body if they are 
deemed to play a role in consciousness.
We are neither saying, that with the current status of neuroscience, such 
a description is actually possible, nor that scientists should actually proceed 
in such a way. The presented procedure would, however, yield the most 
complete explanation possible for any given observation. In practice, many 
of these steps are left out for reasons of simplicity. There are two reasons 
this can be done:
(1) We can reasonably assume some device to work in a certain way. 
For example, physicists usually don’t understand or describe the entire 
measuring device they are using. They simply assume that it displays the 
results correctly, while always being aware of the possibility that this as-
sumption is wrong. Note that the scientist also doesn’t have to understand 
the exact workings of the measuring device. The only important issue is 
that he understands which reading on the display corresponds to which 
state of the physical system being measured. The same goes for our brain. 
The precise workings of it as well as the precise correspondence of certain 
states of the brain with observations is still a mystery. Yet, we know roughly 
what observation to expect when a certain pattern of light enters our eye. 
But here we also have to be aware of the possibility of our brain not work-

20
ing precisely the way we expect. The most extreme example would be the 
possibility of hallucination.
(2) Part of the ‘full description’ can be left out, because the precise ob-
servation is often not of interest. We are rather interested in whether the 
observation is of a certain type. For example, when reading some measure-
ment on a computer screen, it is irrelevant if the perception of the screen is 
slightly tilted due to the head of the observer leaning to the left.
An important aspect of our viewpoint is, as with most logical positivists, 
the notion that our observations can justify observational sentences. They 
can thus serve as a basis for all science. Karl Popper called this perspective 
psychologism (Popper 2005). It is opposed to doxasm, which states that all 
justification of statements must be through deductive reasoning from other 
statements. Psychologism claims that experiencing something is sufficient 
justification for the linguistic representation of this experience. Sometimes 
this is taken to be a certain justification. The reasoning for this is that, while 
you may be experiencing a hallucination and thus not experience reality 
correctly, you cannot possibly be mistaken about the experience itself.
Popper, in his Logic of Discovery (Popper 2005), further claimed that a 
theory-independent language of observation is impossible. Instead of obser-
vational language, he introduces ‘basic statements’. These serve as the most 
fundamental sentences by which more general theories can be tested. There 
are two main differences between Popper’s view and the one we hold. The 
first is that Popper doesn’t allow for separate theoretical and observational 
languages. The reason he believes such a separation to be impossible will 
be discussed in section 4.1. The second regards the justification of these 
sentences. Popper disregards what he called psychologism. He thinks jus-
tification is only possible through logical deduction by other sentences. 
Instead, he proposes that the ‘basic statements’ are not supposed to be free 
from theoretical elements. They must be singular existential statements 
which can be agreed upon by scientists. They are fallible and may later be 
rejected. While scientists may be motivated by observation to accept certain 
basic statements, observation does not serve as a justification.
We believe there is a fundamental problem with relying on a consensus 
for basic statements. The individual scientist has no guideline on the basis of 
which to decide whether to accept a basic statement or not. Popper agrees 
that observation serves as a basis for knowledge for the individual, but it 

21
may never justify a statement (Popper 2005, p. 74). How can the individual 
scientist thus know whether to accept a certain basic statement or not? And, 
if the individual scientists have no criteria by which to decide whether to ac-
cept a statement or not, any statement they will be able to collectively agree 
upon will thus not have been reached by any criteria which might justify giv-
ing this statement a somehow heightened epistemic status. All that happens 
when scientists reach a consensus is that the individuals happen to accept 
the same sentence, each one of them with no justification whatsoever. We 
might as well accept basic statements generated by any other means, such 
as a random generator. Note that basic statements, and thus all of science, 
don’t have any connection to observation at all, other than that they might 
or might not be a motivating factor for individual scientists. This raises the 
question, whether science as imagined by Popper can even be considered 
empirical. Popper’s conventionalism may be true in the sense that it describes 
how scientists actually proceed. If a basic statement is agreed on by everyone, 
scientists can use it to falsify theories, but this is independent of whether the 
statement is actually true. In the words of Dennis Graemer:
‘Ohne einen gewissen Grad an Einigkeit innerhalb der Forschergemeinschaft kann 
keine Theorie ihre Geltung beanspruchen. In dieser Hinsicht hat Popper mit seinem 
Konventionalismus durchaus Recht: Faktisch gesehen werden Basissätze immer 
durch Beschluss anerkannt. Egal wie falsch, egal wie schlecht begründet ein Satz 
auch sein mag, wenn er von der gesamten wissenschaftlichen Gemeinschaft als 
wahr anerkannt wird, so stellt dieser Satz de facto einen Basissatz dar, an dem jene 
Wissenschaftler ihre Theorien prüfen könnten. In dieser deskriptiven Hinsicht ist 
die Aussage, dass Basissätze durch Beschluss zustande kämen, geradezu trivial. 
Aufgabe der Wissenschaftstheorie ist es jedoch, Methoden zu liefern, anhand der-
er Gründe für oder gegen die Anerkennung bestimmter Sätze abgeleitet werden 
können.’
1 (Graemer 2012, p. 6)
1	 ‘Without a certain degree of unity within the research community, no theory 
can claim validity. In this sense, Popper’s conventionalism is correct: factually 
basic statements are always acknowledged through a decision. No matter how 
wrong, no matter how faultily justified a statement may be if it is accepted as 
true by the entire scientific community this statement will de facto be a basic 
statement which scientists could use to test their theories. In this descriptive 
sense the claim that basic statements come about as a decision is almost trivial. 
But the task of philosophy of science is to deliver methods which can be used 
to deduce reasons for or against a specific statement.’ (translated by the author)

22
Much more interesting than the notion that statements cannot be justified 
through observation, seems to be the notion that all statements are neces-
sarily formulated as theory-laden realistic statements. Gerhard Schurz, on 
whom we will rely heavily for introducing a precise classification of terms 
and sentences, partly agrees with this. In his conception observational state-
ments are indeed realistic statements, which also have an observational 
content (Schurz 2013, pp. 107–110). They are, however, not classified as 
‘theoretical statements’. We believe that his notion of using ostensive learn-
ability to distinguish observational statements, also allows for non-realistic 
observational sentences, as we will discuss later.
But why do we even need such non-realistic statements? Introducing 
them into science would be highly complicated and likely have little ben-
efit. We believe them to be beneficial primarily in the realm of philoso-
phy, because it allows for a better understanding of scientific realism and 
instrumentalism. Realism can then be understood as the notion that the 
theoretical statements of science refer to actually existing entities, while 
instrumentalism deems them to be mere tools for the prediction of future 
observations. A more detailed discussion of the ontological debate between 
scientific realism and instrumentalism will follow in section 5.
3.  Classification of Terms and Sentences
In this section we will introduce the idea of empirical and theoretical terms 
in the style of Gerhard Schurz (Schurz 2013, pp. 96 ff.), which will later be 
used to define empirical and theoretical sentences. Empirical and theoretical 
terms are both descriptive terms. This differentiates them from prescriptive 
terms referring to questions of moral judgement. They can also be differenti-
ated from purely logical terms, such as logical connectors.
3.1  Empirical Terms
Empirical terms include both observational terms and empirical disposi-
tion terms.
3.1.1  Observational Terms and Ostensive Learnability
Observational terms refer to some perceivable trait or a complex of such 
traits. Colours are examples of singular perceivable traits. Observational 

23
terms may, however, be much more comprehensive. The term ‘raven’ for 
example can be understood as the perceptions associated with ravens, which 
may include a wide range of properties including shape, colour and sound.
As such, observational terms are terms whose meaning is learnable osten-
sively. A term is learnable ostensively if it can be learned by being pointed 
out positive and negative examples of the term, i.e. by inducing the learner 
with several observations and informing him which of them constitute 
positive and which negative cases of the term.
The observational usage of the word raven, as in the example above, 
differs from the way a biologist might use the term. A biologist will likely 
refer to a raven as a member of a taxon in the sense of some taxonomical 
theory. The taxonomical theory may refer to some criteria which are not 
observational. In the cladistic approach for example, vital importance is 
given to ancestry, which can obviously not be directly observed, but has to 
be reconstructed using genetic and other evidence.
Schurz (2013) understands observational terms to have a realistic con-
tent. But we believe that the concept of ostensive learning also allows for 
observational terms free of any realistic implication. Since the terms are 
learned through observations, there is no reason to start associating any 
more than observational characteristics with them. If someone is taught the 
term ‘raven’ he will be confronted with certain observations. There is no 
reason why he should thus associate anything else but certain observational 
features (e.g. really existing, mind-independent objects) with ‘raven’.
What is, however, required for ostensive learning to work, is an inter-
subjectiveness of observation. If I wish to introduce a new colour-term for 
example, I have to assume that other people experience the same objects in 
a similar manner. Let’s say I wish to teach the term “blue” to someone who 
is not familiar with it. I will point out several objects and comment which 
ones are blue and which ones aren’t. To me the blue objects obviously have 
some similarity, which is why I recognise them as belonging in the category 
‘blue objects’. It is theoretically possible that someone else doesn’t experi-
ence these objects in the same way. He might experience some of them ‘red’. 
In that case he will not be able to learn the new term.
This doesn’t mean that different people have to experience ‘blue’ in the 
same way. There is no way to test that, because we have no access to other 

24
people’s minds. For ostensive learning to work, all we need to assume is 
that we experience certain similarities between the same objects.
While realism might be seen as the best explanation of such an inter-
subjectiveness of observation, it is not necessarily implied by observational 
terms. Realism will be discussed in section 5. The possibility of theory-
independent observational language will be further discussed in section 4.1.
3.1.2  Empirical Disposition Terms
An empirical disposition term expresses the disposition to react to some 
condition in a certain empirically observable way. An example is ‘water-
soluble’, assuming that the dissolving of the substance can be observed. ‘x 
is water-soluble’ is equivalent to the general law hypothesis: ‘Whenever 
x is put in water, it will dissolve.’ All empirical disposition terms can be 
translated into such hypotheses.
Empirical disposition terms transcend the actual observable since one 
cannot observe whether the disposition really does hold true in all possible 
cases. However, they do not reference theoretical entities, but only possible 
observations. Consequently they should be seen as empirical terms.
3.2  Theoretical Terms
Schurz differentiates between theoretical terms in a broad and narrow sense.
3.2.1  Theoretical Terms in the Broad Sense
Theoretical terms in the broad sense (s.l.) are any descriptive terms which 
are not empirical terms, but are nonetheless meaningful. They are not lim-
ited to terms which are part of a scientific theory but may include meta-
physical or speculative terms, if we consider such terms to be nonetheless 
meaningful.
3.2.2  Theoretical Terms in the Narrow Sense
Theoretical terms in the narrow sense (s.s.) are theoretical terms (s.l.) which 
are introduced as part of a scientific theory. They thus exclude any meta-
physical terms, but are limited to scientific theories with empirical relevance. 
If a theoretical term (s.s.) is introduced as part of a theory T, it is called 
T-theoretical. Examples of theoretical terms in physics include force, energy 

25
and current. For simplicity from now on ‘theoretical term’ will always refer 
to theoretical terms (s.s.), as these will be more relevant for our discussion 
of quantum mechanics.
3.3  Classification of Statements
This subsection will discuss the classification of statements offered by Schurz 
(2013, pp. 107–110). We will largely adopt it, with one minor difference, 
which is due to the fact that Schurz consideres observational statements 
to have realistic content and we don’t. A discussion of this divergence is 
made in section 5. We will first present the classification offered by Schurz, 
then explain his reasons for adopting it and why we need to make a slight 
adaptation. As we did with terms we will limit ourselves to the synthetic-
descriptive realm.
The classification of the sentences is based on the type of terms they use, 
as well as their logical form. Schurz’s classification goes as follows:
‘If S is a synthetic-descriptive sentence, the following holds:
a. S is an observation sentence iff apart from logical concepts, S contains only 
observation concepts, and S is either a singular sentence, or a localized existential 
or universal sentence, whose quantifiers possess empirical range.
b. S is an empirical sentence (i.n.s.) iff apart from logical-mathematical concepts,  
S contains only empirical concepts (i.n.s.), and its quantifiers possess empirical range. 
c. S is a theoretical sentence iff S contains theoretical concepts i.w.s. or its quantifiers 
possess theoretical range.
d. S is a T-theoretical sentence of (theoretical i.n.s.) iff S is a theoretical sentence 
i.w.s. and the theoretical concepts of S are introduced by the scientific theory T’ 
(Schurz 2013, p. 108)
The existential or universal statements that make up observational state-
ments must be localised. This allows for an observational examination of 
their truth. So an existential statement would have to specify the location 
of the object, while a universal statement would have to be limited to a 
region which can be observed entirely.
Empirical reach means that only observable objects are included. The 
reason observational statements have to be limited to those objects that can 
be observed is obvious. The statement ‘All objects in this room are red.’ 
cannot truly be considered observational if it includes molecules so small 

26
that they cannot be observed, but which nevertheless reflect light with a 
wavelength corresponding to the colour red.
For us, the redness which an unobservable object might have, i.e. the 
disposition to reflect light with a certain wavelength, is, however, not the 
same as the observational term ‘red’. The observational term simply refers 
to red observations. Schurz on the other hand takes observational terms 
to have a realistic content, which is why the observational term ‘red’ may 
include dispositions which also apply to non observable objects. So, for 
Schurz the limitation ‘empirical reach’ may be necessary, but for us it is 
irrelevant. Unobservable objects cannot be red in our sense.
4.  Theory (In-)dependence
A number of arguments have been put forward to establish a depend-
ence of observation on theoretical concepts (cf. Schurz 2013, 65–72). We 
will distinguish between two sorts of arguments and discuss their accuracy 
and relevance to the view on theory and observation mentioned above. 
The first sort of arguments state that all descriptions of observations do 
include references to theoretical concepts, thus putting into question any 
clear distinction between observational and theoretical statements, as the 
one we adopted in the previous section. The second sort refers to a sup-
posed dependence of the observations made on theoretical assumptions. 
This includes the notion of linguistic relativism, which we will, however, 
discuss lengthier in a separate subsection.
4.1  Theory (In-)dependence of Observational Language
The point that it is impossible to formulate a theory-independent sentence 
was most notably put forward by Karl Popper in the Logic of Discovery:
’Wir können keinen wissenschaftlichen Satz aussprechen, der nicht über das, was 
wir >auf Grund unmittelbarer Erlebnisse< sicher wissen können, weit hinausgeht 
(>Transzendenz der Darstellung<); jede Darstellung verwendet allgemeine Zeichen, 
Universalien, jeder Satz hat den Charakter einer Theorie, einer Hypothese. Der 
Satz: ‘Hier steht ein Glas Wasser’ kann durch keine Erlebnisse verifiziert wer-
den, weil die auftretenden Universalien nicht bestimmten Erlebnissen zugeordnet 

27
werden können (die >unmittelbaren Erlebnisse< sind nur einmal >unmittelbar 
gegeben<, sie sind einmalig).’2 (Karl Popper 2005, p. 71)
‘Here is a glass of water’ is, according to Popper, a realistic statement. It 
transcends the mere observation and references the real existence of a glass. 
Even if we were to replace the sentence with ‘I have the perception of a 
glass of water’, it still contains reference to a glass, which is a theoretical 
and realistic concept.
Schurz’s definition of observational terms as those that can be learned 
ostensively offers a way out of this problem. Schurz himself does take the 
observational statements to have both a realist and an observational content 
(Schurz 2013, p. 65), but ostensive learning relies solely on observations. 
What is learned is thus only observational, too. When the learner is induced 
with certain perceptions, e.g. of a raven, there is no reason he should iden-
tify anything else with the raven than certain observational characteristics. 
An interpretation of observational statements as free of realistic content is 
thus also possible.
We should not dismiss Poppers objection to the notion of pure observa-
tional language completely though. While ostensive learning doesn’t require 
the learner to associate any realistic content with the terms he is learning, 
he does need to make certain theoretical assumptions. If we show him a 
black raven flying in the blue sky, we assume that he will recognise the black 
part of his visual perception as a distinct object from the blue background. 
Such a recognition of individual objects already requires some theoretical 
background. We concede that this is the case. However, the individual 
object, or ‘thing’, doesn’t have to be interpreted in the realist sense. In the 
‘realistic interpretation, this term refers to assumed entities outside of one’s 
experiences, and in the phenomenalistic interpretation it refers to entities 
within one’s experience.’ (Schurz 2013, p. 65)
2	 ‘We can’t speak any scientific statement which doesn’t go far beyond what we 
can know for certain >on the basis of direct experience<. (>transcendence of 
representation<); every representation uses general symbols, universals, every 
statement has the character of a theory, an hypothesis. The statement: ‘Here is 
a glass of water’ can’t be verified by any experience because the occurring uni-
versals can’t be matched with any specific experiences (the >direct experiences< 
are only once >directly given<, they are unique).’ (translation by the author)

28
Let us be a bit clearer on the role of theoretical assumptions in ostensive 
learning. The learner is confronted with several positive and negative cases 
of the term to be learned. How does he, from some particular examples, 
learn an abstract term? The goal is, that he be able to recognise actualisa-
tions of the term, even those he has not been confronted with before. After 
the learning process he should be able to tell which observations constitute 
an example of the term, even if he has not previously been confronted with 
an identical observation. In order to do this he has to form theories about 
what is meant by the term. These theories can then be empirically tested 
through the positive and negative examples he is given.
What kind of theories he will come up with, will depend heavily on his 
previous beliefs, like what kinds of features of the observations he deems 
relevant or what sort of observations he considers to be similar. In fact simi-
larity seems to be very crucial, since an important aspect in ostensive learn-
ing is recognizing the similarities between the various positive examples.
What is not important in ostensive learning, is the belief that the obser-
vations are caused by ‘real’ objects. It can further be argued that, while 
previous (theoretical) beliefs are important for ostensive learning, this 
doesn’t imply that the learned term itself has theoretical content. Either 
way ostensively learned terms, do not have to imply reference to ‘real’ 
mind-independent entities.
4.2  Theory (In-)dependence of Observation
The second sort of argument claims that what observations are made some-
how depends on theoretical assumptions. Here are some ways in which this 
is supposedly the case:
(1)	The theories we hold determine where we direct our attention and what 
experiments we conduct.
(2)	Perception sometimes depends on pre-expectation.
(3)	Our 3D visual observations are constructed by our brain from two 2D 
images received by our retinas.
(4)	Scientific measurement assumes theories about the way the measuring 
apparatus works.
(5)	Observation is language dependent. We can only perceive what is de-
scribable in a language we are familiar with.

29
All of these, except (5) we believe to be true. However, we will doubt that 
they pose any serious problem for us. Afterwards, we will discuss why we 
have doubts (5) is true if seen as a separate point from (1).
(1) claims that which experiments we do depends on the theories we 
accept. This is true, because different theories might raise different ques-
tions, so the experiments we believe to be relevant are guided by them. 
However, it doesn’t follow that two scientists who accept different theories 
will obtain different results if they do happen to perform the same experi-
ment. They will either explain them differently or they may not be able to 
explain them within their theory, meaning they have to either adapt their 
theory or abandon it.
Points (2) – (4) are not problematic, because they all refer to some theo-
ries, which we need to take into account to correctly predict our observa-
tions. This does not contradict the notion that theories are used to explain 
and predict observations. On the contrary, all of these actually specify 
theories we need to take into account when making predictions. We will, 
in order, explain how this is the case for each one.
While perception may sometimes be dependent on pre-expectations, 
there isn’t an absolute correlation. We don’t always experience exactly what 
we expect. I think it is clear how this would lead to an absolute circularity 
of science. Luckily it is not the case.
And as long as it is not the case, we can view (2) simply as another theory, 
which needs to be taken into account when making predictions. To be pre-
cise, it means that we always have to consider, that our perceptions may be 
closer to our expectation, than they would be, if (2) was wrong. Scientists 
can make provisions in order to make sure their observations are not simply 
the result of their pre-expectation, for example by letting computers evalu-
ate the measurements. As long as their observation of the computer screen 
isn’t also completely deluded by their pre-expectations in a way that they 
might even see a 1, when there is really a 0, the non-circularity of science is 
not in danger. And even if this is individually the case, other scientists will 
point out that they are getting different results.
(3) contradicts naïve realism, the notion that we perceive objects as 
they really are. We can, however, simply take into account that what we 
perceive is a construction of two 2D images. If a theory predicts that our 
retinas should receive certain 2D images, by considering how 3D images 

30
are constructed from the 2D images, we can make predictions about our 
actual observation.
Unlike (2) and (3), (4) doesn’t make us aware of a theory that we should 
take into account, but rather reminds us of theories we already assume. 
When performing an experiment to test some new hypothesis, scientists 
always use equipment in the measurement process, which they assume to 
work in a certain way. When for example taking a measurement of tem-
perature with a mercury thermometer, what one directly observes is only 
the expansion or compression of the mercury. We assume that this is related 
to temperature in a certain way.
So what scientists often call ‘data’ is in fact not observation, but rather 
an interpretation of observations based on assumptions about the experi-
mental set up. (4) thus doesn’t concern the distinction between theory and 
observation.
4.3  Linguistic Relativism
The idea of linguistic relativism was made popular by the linguists Edward 
Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf. The core idea is that languages differ in 
important ways which influence the way we experience and conceptualize 
the world (cf. Chris Swoyer 2003). While it may well be true that language 
has an influence on the way we think about the world, we have doubts that 
it influences our observations, except in ways that can be reduced to (1), 
which we have shown to be unproblematic. We will build up our discussion 
of language relativism along the example of the lack of separate words for 
yellow and orange in the Zuni language (Lenneberg and Roberts 1953).
In what way might language influence observations in the sense of (1)? 
Zuni native speakers may, when being confronted with an orange object, 
not have a closer look to see what precise colour it is. Since yellow and 
orange are expressed by the same word in the Zuni language, it may not 
be relevant for them to find out which one it is. This corresponds to (1), 
since it is the theoretical assumptions about the categorization of colour 
that leads the Zuni speaker to not direct his closer attention to the colour 
of the object.
Whether language influences the observations we make if we do di-
rect our attention to a certain object is an empirical matter. We wish to 

31
demonstrate what dramatic empirical consequences it would have if Zuni 
speakers really didn’t see a difference between orange and yellow. If we 
were to generalize this principle it would also imply that english-speakers 
who know the word “blue”, but not words for different shades of blue, 
experience all blue colours the same. It could never be the case that they 
experience two different shades of blue, without knowing what they are 
called. For example if you don’t know the words “Royal blue” and “me-
dium blue”, you’d experience them identically.
The only difference between Zuni-speakers and English-speakers who 
don’t know words for different shades of blue is that in English these dif-
ferent words do exist. Some English-speakers are simply not aware of them. 
So unless the existence of words for colours in the language you speak, 
but which you are not aware of, can influence the way you experience a 
colour we should really expect these consequences. This is, however, highly 
implausible, and we think many people will testify that these consequences 
contradict their personal experience.
We don’t have to rely on such personal testimony, though. Schurz (2013, 
p. 71) made the point that if people who are not aware of two differ-
ent words for orange and yellow were to perceive them the same, they 
shouldn’t be able to learn such words ostensively.3 If they were shown 
yellow and orange objects and then told which ones are yellow and which 
ones are orange, they couldn’t tell the difference, so would thus later not 
know when to use the word for orange and when the word for yellow. 
This is, however, not the case. Speakers of the Tiv and Dani languages 
were able to learn colour concepts for which there is no word in their 
native tongue ostensively (Garnham and Oakhill 1994, pp. 39–51; Berlin 
and Kay 1999, p. 24).
A weaker version of linguistic relativism, in which the difference be-
tween colours for which one does not know a name is experienced, but 
less intensive, may still be true. As long as there is some small difference 
one would in principle be able to learn words for the different colours 
ostensively. The burden of proof for this rests with the proponents of such 
a theory though and if it were true, it would not pose a serious problem 
3	 Compare section 3.1.1 for an explanation of the concept of ostensive learning. 

32
to the distinction between theory and observation. While this would be 
another example of the influence of ones theories on ones observations, 
comparable to (2), it does not imply that theory and observation aren’t in 
principle distinguishable concepts or that science is a circular enterprise.
5.  Ontological Status of Scientific Theories
There is a variety of positions on the ontological status of scientific theories. 
The most important divide in ontology is been between realism and ideal-
ism (antirealism). Historically ontology has often been concerned with the 
status of the objects of our everyday experiences. In philosophy of science, 
the focus is on the status of scientific theories and the theoretical entities 
they entail. Here the main positions have been named scientific realism and 
scientific instrumentalism. In the first subsection we will attempt to define 
(anti-)realism and distinguish the debate from other philosophical issues. 
The second subsection introduces different kinds of antirealism and real-
ism. Next we will argue against various of these positions. Finally we will 
discuss our own position, which is in the tradition of the logical positivists.
5.1  Realism and Antirealism
Realists believe that there is some sort of reality which is independent of 
the mind. Objects that are part of this reality exist independently of our 
observation of them or our theories about them. Antirealists either deny this 
or claim that the notion of mind-independent existence is ill-defined. They 
believe that only the content of minds can be said to exist, i.e. conscious 
experiences, observations, thoughts, beliefs and ideas. A more differentiat-
ing account of the sort of things antirealists believe to exist will be given 
in the next section.
Epistemological realism is logically stronger than this (ontological) real-
ism. In addition to claiming that a mind-independent reality exists, it is 
claimed that we can gain knowledge about this reality. While epistemologi-
cal realism can be seen as a position on epistemology rather than ontology, 
it implies ontological realism. It makes no sense to claim we have access to 
mind-independent reality without also believing that such a reality exists. 
But it remains important to note that whether something exists and what we 
can know about it are two different issues. One may well be an ontological 

33
realist without being an epistemological realist. In that case one believes 
that there exists something which is independent of the mind, but we can 
never know anything about it.
Scientific realism and instrumentalism deal specifically with the onto-
logical status of scientific theories. The former holds that the theoretical 
entities which are part of our scientific theories refer to some real entities. 
The exact nature of the relationship between the theory and these entities 
is subject of debate.
Recall the classification of terms presented in section 3. Observational 
terms are those that can be learned ostensively. Unlike Schurz, we consider 
them to have purely observational content, i.e. the observable traits associ-
ated with it. They may include theoretical interpretation, but only of ob-
servations, not mind-independent objects. Distinct from the observational 
terms are the theoretical terms, which don’t simply reference observations.
With such a classification in mind we get a clearer notion of scientific 
realism and what its rejection implies. Rejection usually implies the belief 
that the content of science can be reduced to (potential) observations. Only 
observational statements refer to real entities, i.e. observations.
Instrumentalists believe that the goal of science is simply to explain and 
predict observations. Theories are selected for their utility for making cor-
rect predictions. Their theoretical entities are not seen as referring to real 
entities, or at least this is not seen as relevant.
One might think that realism and scientific realism have to go hand in 
hand and that the same is true for antirealism and instrumentalism. But 
this is not necessarily the case. Scientific realism entails realism, because it 
postulates the existence of that which scientific theories are thought to refer 
to. However, an ontological realist may believe that a mind-independent 
reality exists, but that scientific theories don’t refer to it. This might be the 
position of an ontological realist who is not also an epistemological realist.
For the same reason, instrumentalism doesn’t necessarily imply idealism. 
One may, as a realist, believe that scientific theories don’t refer to reality, 
but that we can still use it to predict observations. On the other hand ideal-
ism does seem to imply instrumentalism, unless someone suggests an op-
tion that is distinct from both scientific realism and instrumentalism, since 
idealism is certainly not compatible with scientific realism.

34
These considerations demonstrate the difference between the ontologi-
cal question ‘Is there a mind-independent reality’ on the one side and the 
epistemological question ‘What can we know about mind-independent real-
ity?’ on the other side. In philosophy of science the epistemological ques-
tion addresses scientific theories in particular. What do they tell us about 
a mind-independent reality? All of these questions are interrelated though, 
and will be considered in this section.
Another issue which needs to be distinguished from ontology is that of 
the correspondence theory of truth, which states that the truth of a state-
ment is determined by a correspondence of the statement with reality. The 
statement ‘There exists a black raven.’ is true if and only if there really does 
exist a black raven. One can thus argue, that for any statement to be true 
there has to be a reality with which the statement can correspond. This is 
true; however, it tells us nothing about the content of this reality. Is it lim-
ited to the content of minds or does it include mind-independent objects? 
An idealist can thus also accept the correspondence theory of truth, only 
that he believes the reality with which a statement might correspond to be 
limited to minds. The correspondence theory of truth is thus ‘metaphysically 
neutral’ (cf. Kirkham 1992, sec 6.5). It does, however, raise the question 
whether an antirealist can consider theoretical statements to be true, since 
antirealists don’t believe them to refer to anything with which they might 
correspond. Instead of regarding theoretical statements as truth carriers, 
they could be described as more or less ‘useful’ in predicting observations. 
The correspondence theory of truth can, however, still be applied to obser-
vational statements.
5.2  Kinds of (Anti-)Realism
This subsection will introduce some important ontological positions. The 
first part will introduce more fundamental positions and more complex 
views, which are often based on these fundamental positions, will be dis-
cussed in the second part.
5.2.1  Fundamental Positions
There are three important kinds of idealism (Dancy 1985, p. 136 ff., Schurz 
2013, p. 60):

35
Subjective idealism/Solipsism: Only ones own experiences exist.
Intersubjective idealism: Only ones own experiences and those of other subjects 
exist.
Possibilistic idealism: The possible experiences of all subjects exist.
While all idealists agree that only experiences exist, they don’t agree on 
what subjects there are that might have experiences and on whether pos-
sible experience can be said to exist, too. Solipsism can be seen as the 
most restrictive form of idealism. A solipsists believes only in his own 
experiences. Intersubjective idealists acknowledge that there are other sub-
jects than themselves. Opinions on what other subjects exist vary, e.g. on 
whether non-human animals may be subjects. Note that the recognition 
of other subjects doesn’t imply that one has access to the experiences of 
other subjects. Precisely this makes it hard to recognise other subjects as 
subjects, though. Possibilistic idealists also believe possible experiences to 
exist in some sense. At least they believe statements about such experiences 
to be meaningful. If there is a table inside a room with no person inside, a 
possibilistic idealist might say, ‘If someone was to enter the room, they’d 
see a table.’, even if no one actually does so.
Epistemic Realism can be divided into two forms (Schurz 1995):
Naive Realism: Reality is exactly as we experience it.
Indirect Realism: Reality is not exactly as we experience it, but we can indirectly 
gain knowledge about it through our experiences.
Naive realism is largely disregarded now, which is partly due to the fact 
that our 3D visual observations are constructed by our brain from two 2D 
images received by our retinas, a fact we already mentioned in section 4.2. 
However, most realists believe that we can gain knowledge about reality 
through our experiences, even though our experiences cannot be said to be 
an exact, direct representation of reality.
Other fundamental positions which we already discussed in the previous 
subsection are ontological realism, scientific realism and instrumentalism. 
It should be noted that it is also possible to take a scepticist stance on most 
of these issues. One might for example be a scepticist towards the question 
of the existence of other subjects. In that case one doesn’t deny such an 
existence, as a solipsist does, but one believes that we cannot know whether 
other subjects exist or not. The same can be said for realism. A scepticist 
may not only argue that we have no knowledge about the truth of certain 

36
realistic statements, such as realistic interpretations of scientific theories, 
but also that we can have no knowledge of whether such a reality exists. 
Such a position is also opposed to idealism which states that such a reality 
doesn’t exist or that the concept is ill-defined.
5.2.2  Advanced Positions
Two specific antirealist positions we would like to discuss are radical con-
structivism and logical positivism. While both are antirealist, there are sig-
nificant differences in their argumentation against realism. We will discuss 
them in turn.
Radical constructivists argue that our perceptions are not of a reality as 
it is. Instead, they are constructions by our mind or brain. They conclude 
from this that there can be no discoverable reality independent of our mind 
and further no mind-independent reality at all. One could say that a rejec-
tion of naive realism leads them to rejecting epistemic realism altogether, 
which in turn leads to a rejection of ontological realism or at least scientific 
realism. We will examine the validity of this argumentation in section 5.5.
Logical positivism is an umbrella term for a range of views on the phi-
losophy of science, most notably those held by members of the Vienna 
Circle. While their views on ontology varied, a common theme seems to be 
the notion that real existence of mind-independent objects is a meaningless 
concept, since it doesn’t have empirical content. Not only does it not add 
predictive power to a theory, but it is not even understandable, since it can-
not be reduced to empirical terms. Consequently logical positivists don’t 
claim that there is no mind-independent reality, but rather that the claim of 
its existence is meaningless. The negation of it is thus just as meaningless. 
We will argue for a modern version of logical positivism in section 5.7.
Next we will discuss two opposing realist positions. An important dis-
tinction is to be made between metaphysical realism and hypothetical re-
alism (Schurz 2013, p. 293). Both are forms of scientific realism. Let us 
explain what we mean by metaphysical and hypothetical realism, before 
we will introduce hypothetical-constructive realism, as an example of hy-
pothetical realism.
For a metaphysical realist, scientific realism, i.e. the notion that theoreti-
cal entities refer to real entities, is ‘a necessary precondition of theoretical 

37
science’ (described, but not endorsed by Schurz 2013, p. 293), a view we 
will argue against in section 5.4. Hypothetical realists view scientific realism 
as a ‘fallible hypothesis’ (Schurz 2013, p. 63), which relies on justification 
through its ‘empirical success’ (Schurz 2013, p. 61).
Hypothetical-constructive realism holds that the tie between a true state-
ment and the object it refers to is not a ‘quasi-identical mirror-image’, but 
a ‘structural correspondence’ (Schurz 2013, p. 62). The relationship is thus 
neither exact nor unique. A true statement is merely ‘an incomplete struc-
tural representation’ (Ibid.) of some aspect of reality. Schurz puts emphasis 
on constructive realism being a hypothetical realism (Schurz 2013, p.293 
ff.). The hypothesis of realism is not given a priori. but requires justifi-
cation through abduction, i.e. the inference of the best explanation. The 
explanandum is the empirical success of scientific theories. We will discuss 
the justification of constructive realism further in section 5.6.
5.3  The Case against Solipsism
Solipsism often relies on sceptic arguments that question our ability to 
have knowledge of other minds. We may be able to observe the physical 
body of other people, the way they behave and communicate with us. But 
none of this ever gives us access to their minds. So how do we even know 
they have one? Such sceptic arguments cannot establish a strong version of 
solipsism that claims we can have knowledge that there are no other minds. 
Just because we don’t have access to other minds, doesn’t mean they don’t 
exist. A sceptical version of solipsism, that simply states that we cannot 
know whether other minds exist or not, is, however, much more difficult 
to refute and arguably there will always remain some justified scepticism.
The most promising approach to establishing other minds seems to be 
that of analogical inference (cf. Alec Hylsop 2014, sec. 3.1). The idea is that 
we experience other people to be like us in various ways, including their 
physical characteristics, behaviour and the thoughts they communicate. 
Since these seem to correlate with certain states of mind for us, it seems 
plausible that the same holds for others. Modern proponents of this argu-
ment often bring it in the form of a scientific inference. Admittedly, the 
empirical basis for such an inference is relatively small compared to what 
is trying to be established. We only have access to one person’s mind, our 

38
own, yet we intend to establish the existence of minds of billions of people 
and possibly even non-humans. It does, however, yield us a certain level 
of justification.
5.4  The Case against Metaphysical Realism
As discussed in section 5.2.2 metaphysical realism holds that realism is a 
necessary presupposition of science. One way of arguing this is by build-
ing the discovery of mind-independent reality into the goal of science. This 
seems to be a cheap trick because with it we can establish almost anything, 
simply by claiming it is presupposed by the goal of science. What many 
should be able to agree on though is that part of the goal of science, if not 
the goal of science, is ‘to find true and content-rich statements, laws, or 
theories, relating to a given domain of phenomena’ (Schurz 2013, p. 19, 
also cf. Weingartner 1978, sec. 3.2.). But that truth, particularly the cor-
respondence theory of truth, does not require correspondence with a mind-
independent reality was already established in section 5.1.
The existence of antirealist approaches to science puts into question 
the necessity of realism for science on a more general level. If science re-
ally does presuppose realism, one should be able to point out exactly why 
these antirealist approaches are unsatisfying. While one might disagree with 
them on various points, including the justification of their antirealism, the 
implication that science is impossible on their premises seems to be much 
stronger and requires additional justification.
A further argument against (metaphysical) realism, named Pessimistic 
Meta-Induction draws on empirical evidence from the history of science 
(cf. Laudan 1996). Many scientific theories that have been empirically suc-
cessful are now considered outdated and it is no more believed that their 
theoretical entities have counterparts in the real world. Yet they were empir-
ically successful nonetheless. So the finding of empirical successful theories 
doesn’t seem to require correspondence with mind-independent reality. An 
example for an empirically successful theory which was later replaced, given 
by Laudan, is the phlogiston theory, which is now dismissed in favour of the 

39
oxygen theory.4 We will return to the Pessimistic Meta-Induction argument 
in our discussion of constructive realism in section 5.6.
5.5  The Case against Radical Constructivism
As presented in section 5.2.2, radical constructivism concludes from a re-
jection of naive realism that reality itself is constructed. This seems to be 
quite a leap. Schurz (2013), argues that the ‘subtle Error’ is the failure to 
recognise that the concept of ‘knowing’ doesn’t have to be understood ‘in 
the naive-realistic sense of a kind of direct mirror-imaging’ (Schurz 2013, 
p. 62). Instead we should understand ’the relationship between a true state-
ment and its object not as a quasi-identical mirror-image, but as a structural 
correspondence, which conveys certain information and neither has to be 
complete or unique’ (Ibid.).
The case of the constructive realists like Schurz, drawing partly on argu-
ments put forward by other scientific realists, is a strong one. It will be the 
subject of the next section. We will suggest that arguments in the framework 
of radical constructivism are not sufficient to convincingly reject construc-
tive realism.
5.6  The Case for and against Constructive Realism
5.6.1  Inference of the Best Explanation
For constructive realists, a structural correspondence between an empiri-
cally successful scientific theory and reality is justified as the best expla-
nation of its empirical success. A well-known version of this argument, 
the No-Miracles Argument, was put forward by Putnam (1975, p. 73). 
According to this argument, the empirical success of science would be an 
incredible miracle if not for scientific realism. It is thus more plausible to 
accept some form of scientific realism. The problem with inference of the 
best explanation or abduction is that they are not valid in the strictly logical 
sense. This raises the question of its justification, which will be discussed 
in section 5.6.4.
4	 The original oxygen theory has today also been replaced by a more generalized 
theory of oxidization.

40
5.6.2  Pessimistic Meta-Induction
Pessimistic Meta-Induction, which was already mentioned in section 5.4, 
can be seen as a counter-argument to the No-Miracles Argument. If empiri-
cal success justifies the belief in a (structural) correspondence with reality, 
how come originally empirically successful theories had to be revised so 
often in the history of science? Meta-Induction, i.e. the use of an induction 
for evaluating methods, suggests that, since the No-Miracles Argument or 
inference of the best explanation are not very successful, we are not justified 
in using them. It is important to stress that this is an empirical argument 
based on evidence from the history of science. It thus depends on the empiri-
cal claims it is based on, i.e. that historically a significant number of empiri-
cally successful scientific theories have eventually turned out to be wrong.
5.6.3  Intertheoretical Correspondence
Structural correspondence offers a way to deal with Pessimistic Meta-
Induction. Even if theories are using ‘false ontologies’, i.e. they postulate 
theoretical entities which don’t correspond to real objects, there may still be 
‘something true in their theoretical superstructure’ (Schurz 2013, p. 296). 
Constructive realism doesn’t treat true statements as a mirror image of 
reality, but as having a structural correspondence with it. Therefore there 
may be some structural correspondence between a theory and reality, even 
if the theory is false and another theory shows a stronger correspondence.
The idea is that if a new theory replaces an old theory and entails all of 
the old theory’s empirical success, then the correspondence with reality of 
the old theory may be conserved, even if the ontologies of the two theories 
contradict each other. This in turn leads to a correspondence between the 
old theory and the new theory. Correspondences between successive scien-
tific theories have been pointed out by Boyd (1984) and Worrall (1989/97).
Laudan’s responded by arguing that the cases given are mere excep-
tions and offers a list of counter-examples (Laudan 1996, p. 121). In these 
examples, he argues, the successive theories have incompatible ontologies 
and it is therefore impossible that there is any correspondence between 
their theoretical structures. What he seems to fail to realise is that while 
two different theories will almost always have different, incompatible on-
tologies, this doesn’t necessarily mean that parts of them can’t show some 

41
similarity in the structure. This similarity can be understood in terms of a 
correspondence relations.
Schurz (2009) goes so far as to claim the opposite of Laudan. He offers 
logical proof for his Correspondence Theorem based on assumptions he 
deems plausible. The Correspondence Theorem states;
‘if a physical system x satisfies the conditions A (which define the range of [the theory 
T] and [its successor theory] T*’s shared empirical success), then x satisfies the 
T-theoretical description τ iff x satisfies the T*-theoretical description τ *.’ (Schurz 
2013, p. 297)
This means that some structural correspondence between two successive 
theories which share some empirically successful predictions is necessary. 
Schurz, goes on to show how one of the conflicting ontologies examples 
given by Laudan, the succession of phlogiston theory by oxidation theory, 
does in fact include a correspondence relation.
There are two reasons Schurz’s Correspondence Theorem is relevant. 
First of all, it follows that the Pessimistic Meta-Induction argument fails, 
because in all cases of succession of theories some structure of the original 
theory is conserved. The replacement by a successor theory thus doesn’t 
necessarily mean that the original theory didn’t correspond to reality in 
some way. It might be that the structure that has been conserved is actually 
one corresponding to some aspect of reality. The second reason Schurz’s 
Correspondence Theorem is relevant is that it serves as a basis for his at-
tempt at justifying abduction or inference of the best explanation, as we 
will see in the next subsection.
5.6.4  Justification of Abduction according to Schurz
Schurz (2009, sec. 7.3), continues by arguing that the correspondence theo-
rem may provide a justification of the abductive argument for realism, if a 
further assumption is made. The correspondence theorem itself only implies 
that if the present theory is true, there is some truth to a preceding theory 
which shares some of the empirical success of the current theory. But in-
stead of considering a current theory, we can apply it to an unknown ideal 
theory’(Schurz 2013, p. 299). Schurz calls the assumption that such an ideal 
theory, which offers ‘an approximately true description of the structure of 
reality’ exists, minimal realism. If we apply the correspondence theorem 

42
to this ideal theory, it follows that strong empirical success of any theory 
implies partial realistic truth.
Since Schurz has to make the assumption of minimal realism, his argu-
ment can be attacked by rejecting his assumption from the start. Nonethe-
less, his argument serves as a powerful counter to the radical constructivists, 
since their arguments are critical of our ability to gain knowledge of reality. 
Schurz managed to demonstrate that, assuming an ideal theory describing 
the structure of reality exists, we are justified in assuming our empirically 
successful theories entail some truth. So the assumption that we can have 
no access to reality, made by the radical constructivists, is put into question.
5.6.5  The Logical Positivist Objection
A typical logical positivist position is to deny that the notion of ‘real ex-
istence’ of theoretical entities is meaningful. Meaning has to be related to 
observation. However, the notion of ‘real existence’ doesn’t add empirical 
content to a theory. This objection can be raised to constructive realism, 
too. Here the talk is of ‘structural correspondence’ of theories with real-
ity. Nonetheless this correspondence doesn’t add empirical content, if this 
reality is understood as mind-independent.
A logical positivist thus also has to reject Schurz’s justification of abduc-
tion, since it is based on the assumption of minimal realism. Minimal real-
ism presupposes the existence of a reality, which is described by an ideal 
theory. But it is the meaningfulness of the notion of such a reality which is 
already being denied.
It might be argued that, even if we cannot rely on Schurz’s justification 
of abduction, scientific realism can be established through scientific infer-
ence. If this inference should not be justified, this is not just a problem of 
realism, but of science in general. This argument is independent of what 
precise form we believe such an inference to have, e.g. abduction, induction 
or critical testing as suggested by Popper (2005).
The difference between the use of such arguments to justify realism, and 
the use of scientific inference in empirical science, is that a realistic theory 
doesn’t have more empirical content than its non-realistic counter-part. In 
science an empirically successful theory may be explained by a more general 
theory. But this general theory has to explain additional evidence or make 

43
additional predictions, not already given by the former theory. With real-
ism this is not the case.
Realism is in this regard no different than the metaphysical explanations 
criticised by the Vienna Circle. Among these were vitalist theories, which 
attempted to explain aspects of living organisms by a vital force or entel-
echie, as Hans Driesch called it (cf. Verein Ernst Mach 1981, p. 312). The 
idea is that living organisms have certain characteristics such as growth or 
the ability to move because of a vital force. Sometimes vitalists were able 
to give accurate descriptions of empirical correlations. These were to be 
explained by vitalism.
The logical positivists argued that terms such as vital force cannot be 
constituted from the observable and are thus meaningless. We can disregard 
vitalism for a similar reason, without having to accept a verificationist crite-
rion of meaning. The hypothesis of vitalism simply doesn’t add any empiri-
cal content to the mere description of observable correlations, on which 
vitalists and non-vitalists often agreed. Vitalism tells us nothing about the 
way an organism moves or grows, beyond what we already know and are 
trying to explain. It should be easy to accept that such an explanation is 
useless at best.
The same can be said for realism. When assuming ‘real existence’ of 
the theoretical entities of some theory, we add no empirical content to our 
theory at all. There are no predictions we can make with the assumption 
of ‘real existence’ that we can’t also make without it. We should elabo-
rate a bit further, since we have to recognise that for proponents of the 
No-Miracles argument, scientific realism doesn’t attempt to explain any 
particular empirical regularities, but rather that there are such regularities 
at all. Without such regularities science could not be so successful. But the 
response to this is in principle the same: What does scientific realism tell 
us about these regularities except that they exist? And that they exist we 
already know. We have to acknowledge that there are some things for which 
there is no scientific explanation. They are brute facts, which we simply 
have to accept based on the empirical evidence. If we don’t accept this, we 
will soon be postulating all kinds of metaphysical entities and additional 
metaphysical entities to explain these and so on. A similar view is expressed 
by Van Fraasen in The Scientific Image (1980, p. 19 ff.).

44
5.7  Towards a Modern Radical Empiricism
Based on our considerations so far, we believe that, while we may need to 
reject some typical logical positivist views, the case against realism is still a 
very strong one. We should thus work towards a modern version of radical 
empiricism, drawing on the ideas considered here, including the concept of 
ostensive learnability as a basis for observational language. An important 
work on radical empiricism, which should also be taken into account, is The 
Scientific Image by Van Fraasen (Ibid.). It is beyond the scope of this article 
to present such a modern radical empiricism in detail. Van Fraasen offers 
a much more comprehensive account. We will simply present four points 
which we think can serve as a fundament of a radical empiricist outlook. 
These will be sufficient for our discussion of quantum mechanics. Readers 
familiar with Van Fraasen will notice some fundamental deviation from his 
work. A detailed account of our differences with Van Fraasen may be the 
content of future work.
5.7.1  The Independence of Theory
Unlike some other radical empiricists, we take theory to be relatively inde-
pendent from observation. Theoretical terms don’t have to be constituted 
through empirical terms. Instead, certain theoretical states are correlated 
with certain observations. The designation of these correlations is not in-
tended to be a definition. It only links the theory to observations, so that 
it can actually make empirical predictions, rather than simply predictions 
about purely theoretical states. We discussed this link in more detail in 
section 2.
5.7.2  Observational Language as Ostensively  
Learnable Language
Following Schurz (2013), we introduced observational language as osten-
sively learnable language in section 3.1.1. We believe that ostensive learn-
ability serves as a good criterion, because ostensive learning depends on 
observable differences. We can thus use it to really capture observational 
concepts as opposed to theoretical concepts.

45
5.7.3  The Limited Theory-Ladeness of Observational Language
As we discussed in section 4.1, observational language does contain some 
theoretical content, even when defined through ostensive learning. But the 
important thing for us is solely that it doesn’t have to contain realistic 
content. While we might make certain theoretical assumptions when in-
terpreting our observation, we don’t have to assume realism. Even if there 
are some problems separating observational from theoretical content, there 
can be little doubt that these are in principle different.
5.7.4  Literalness of Theories
One Point which we haven’t discussed so far is the literalness of theory, 
suggested by Van Fraasen (1980, pp. 9–13). Van Fraasen makes a distinc-
tion between two types of antirealism:
‘The first sort holds that science is or aims to be true, properly (but not liter-
ally) construed. The second holds that the language of science should be literally 
construed, but its theories need not be true to be good. The anti-realism I shall 
advocate belongs to the second sort.’ (Ibid., p. 10)
‘Orthodox’ instrumentalists believe that there is no relevant difference be-
tween two theories with identical empirical predictions. They ‘hold that two 
theories may in fact say the same thing although in form they contradict 
each other’ (Ibid, pp. 10–11). They share the same truth-value, because of 
their identical empirical content. By taking a theory literally, one rejects 
this view and accepts it as opposed to any theory with a distinct theoreti-
cal structure.
Unlike realists Van Fraasen, however, doesn’t take theories to be literally 
true. They don’t refer to real entities. The theoretical structure is nonetheless 
deemed important, because accepting a particular structure corresponds 
to subscribing to a particular research program. Research based on one 
theoretical structure will lead in a different direction than research based 
on another structure. So even if two theories make identical predictions 
at the moment, further research may develop them in different directions.
One such example where the choice of theoretical structure matters is the 
combination of different theories. When combining two theories we equate 
some of their theoretical entities. The way we can combine them, and this 
may affect the empirical adequacy of the resulting theory, may well depend 

46
on which theoretical entities and structure we choose for the theories. In 
section 13.3 we will suggest that this may be relevant for the formulation 
of a theory of quantum gravity.
We think that Van Fraasens’ viewpoint offers a sensible middleground be-
tween ‘orthodox’ instrumentalism and scientific realism. It does not include 
reference to an independent reality, which we deemed to add no empirical 
content in section 5.6.5. At the same time it allows us to recognise theories 
with distinct theoretical structures as significantly distinct from one another.
Note that although we believe theories should be taken literally, this 
doesn’t mean that in principle the goal of science is something other than 
to find empirically adequate theories, as suggested by the scientific instru-
mentalists. This view is thus not entirely contradictory to instrumentalism. 
The suggestion is simply to take theories literally in order to be better able 
to generate more complete and empirically adequate theories.

Part II.  Basics of Quantum Physics
This chapter will attempt to give a brief introduction to quantum physics. 
It is beyond the scope of this article to give a detailed explanation of the 
mathematical structure of quantum theory, so instead we will simply give 
an incomplete overview of the most important aspects. Hopefully this will 
be comprehensible to laymen and equip them with the basic knowledge 
necessary for understanding our discussion of the concepts of theory and 
observation in quantum physics, which we will present in the next chapter.
We will begin by considering the picture of the world presented by clas-
sical physics. Afterwards we will consider some of the experimental results 
that started to shatter this picture and the explanation offered by quantum 
mechanics. We will introduce the restrictions on interpretations of quan-
tum physics imposed by Bell’s Theorem and the Kochen-Specker Theorem. 
Finally, we will discuss some of the many alternative interpretations.
6.  The Classical Picture of the World
In classical physics, a system is always thought to have a certain state and 
several properties. These properties are independent of measurement. While 
a measurement constitutes an interaction with the system and may thus 
influence the system in a way which is also described by classical physics, 
the properties are nonetheless thought to exist prior to and independent 
of the measurement.
There may be several mathematical formalisms describing the same issue. 
Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics are both reformulations 
of the mechanics of Newton that use different mathematical approaches, 
but yield exactly the same results (cf. Fließbach 2009). All three formula-
tions can be shown to be logically equivalent.
Classical physics is generally thought to be deterministic. This means 
two things:
(1)	Complete knowledge of the state of the system allows one to deduce 
all properties of the system and the results of any measurements taken.
(2)	Complete knowledge of the state of a system in principle allows one to 
predict the state of the system at any future moment in time.

48
It is interesting to note that it follows that we can also predict all proper-
ties and results of measurements for the future.
Let us consider the non-relativistic case of two uncharged particles of 
masses m1 and m2 in free space.5 Free space means that there are no ex-
ternal force fields. Or in layman’s terms, there is nothing else to influence 
the movement of the particles. This example is known as the two-body 
problem. We assume full knowledge of the system. In this case this means, 
we know m1 and m2, the position of the particles as well as their relative 
velocities. From this knowledge, we can deduce all properties of the system 
such as momentum or energy. This corresponds to (1). The predictions of 
future states of the system, i.e. the future positions and velocities of the 
particles is also possible. In principle all we need for this are these two laws:
(1)	The force acting on a particle is equal to its mass multiplied by its ac-
celeration, i.e. rate of change of velocity.
(2)	The law of gravity describing the magnitude and direction of the force 
acting on a particle in terms of the masses of the particle and the particle 
exerting the force as well as their relative position.
A solution of the two-body problem is presented in Fließbach (2009), and 
most other textbooks on classical mechanics. Strong doubts about the uni-
versal possibility of deterministic prediction in newtonian mechanics have 
been raised by Norton (2003). Norton suggests an example, known as 
Norton’s dome, for which he claims the Newtonian equations have more 
than one solution. According to which of these solutions the system evolves 
would thus not be predictable. We will not discuss Norton’s dome in any 
more detail here.
In classical statistical physics the system is not fully described, i.e. not 
all information about the state of the system, in statistical physics referred 
to as microstate, is given. Instead, the different possible microstates are as-
signed statistical weight. Such a description is referred to as a macrostate. 
The system is thought to be in a certain microstate; however, information 
about the precise state of a many particle system is impossible to attain and 
5	 Non-relativistic means we will not consider relativistic effects described by the 
theories of special and general relativity. This is a newtonian example, meaning 
it can be completely described by the mechanics of Isaac Newton. 

49
usually irrelevant (cf. Fließbach 2010). The statistical weight assigned to 
the microstates is thus an epistemic probability. It is epistemic since it is not 
thought to be due to some uncertainty in the world, but only uncertainty 
of our knowledge of the world.
Lack of complete knowledge of the original state may have dramatic 
consequences in so-called chaotic systems (cf. Schurz 2006). Chaotic sys-
tems are systems for which a small difference in the original state may lead 
to very different later states. In a non-chaotic system a small difference in 
the original state will only lead to a very small difference in the consecu-
tive states. This means that getting the original state slightly wrong will 
not mean the predictions will be completely off. In a chaotic system this 
doesn’t apply. This can prove particularly problematic when the difference 
between two states is below what is detectable by measurement. If these 
two states will lead to completely different end states, accurate prediction is 
impossible. An example of a chaotic system is the double pendulum. Note, 
however, that the unpredictability of chaotic systems is still due to lack of 
knowledge about the world. In chaotic systems, this lack of knowledge 
simply has more dramatic consequences.
We already mentioned that in classical physics, complete knowledge of 
the state of a system allows an accurate prediction of any measurements 
taken. But what is measurement in classical physics? As we will see, meas-
urement is a bit of an issue in quantum physics, so it makes sense to discuss 
what measurement is in classical physics. During measurement, the system 
under investigation is linked with a measurement device. The system and 
the measurement device interact according to the laws of classical physics. 
Ideally the effect of the measurement device on the physical quantity which 
we wish to measure is minimal. The system, however, has to influence the 
measurement device in a directly observable way that is somehow related 
to the quantity which we wish to measure. In electronic measurement de-
vices the effect is usually translated into an electric signal which is in turn 
translated into a number on a screen. The following example was chosen 
because the device used is a bit simpler than that.
When using a mercury thermometer to measure the temperature of wa-
ter, the thermometer has to be in contact with the water. This allows for 
exchange of energy between the water and the mercury in the thermometer 
until the temperature is in equilibrium, i.e. the temperature of the water 

50
and the mercury are the same. Since there is usually a larger amount of 
water than mercury, and due to the high specific heat capacity of water6, the 
mercury will have little effect on the temperature of the water. The tempera-
ture of the mercury on the other side will adapt to whatever temperature 
the water has if given enough time. The temperature of the mercury is of 
course not directly visible, just as the temperature of the water isn’t. Luckily 
the volume of the mercury correlates with the temperature though, so that 
we can simply check how much the mercury has expanded or contracted.
7.  Experimental Basis of Quantum Physics
This section will discuss so-called double slit experiments, which are well-
suited for explaining the necessity to replace classical notions with those of 
quantum physics. In order to understand the double slit experiments, one 
first has to understand the phenomena of diffraction and superposition. 
After explaining these we will consider the double slit experiment with 
light, which can be explained within classical physics. But, afterwards we 
will consider double slit experiments with other particles, whose results 
classical physics is unable to explain.
The diffraction of waves regards all waves, including for example water 
waves. The idea is that a when a wave front encounters a narrow opening 
in a barrier, roughly the size of the wavelength, it will move through the 
opening and behind the barrier it will spread out from the opening, but 
not just in the direction the wave originally moved in (Halliday et al. 2008,  
p. 963). Figure 1 shows an illustration of this.
Superposition is when the net effect of several effects occurring simul-
taneously is equal to the sum of both effects. One example of this is the 
superposition of waves which states that the displacement of two waves 
at any point in space will be added. This implies that two equal wave 
peaks will combine to a new peak, double the size of the original peaks.
6	 The specific heat capacity is the amount of energy needed to raise the tempera-
ture of 1 kg of a substance by 1◦C

Philip Graemer.
A wave peak and a wave trough on the other side will eradicate each other. 
These effects, called constructive and destructive interference, respectively 
are illustrated in figure 2.
The original double-slit experiment was used by Young (1802) to dem-
onstrate that light is a wave. Two slits in a barrier are used to create two 
diffracted waves. They interfere with each other yielding an alternation of 
constructive and destructive interference between the waves from the two 
slits on a screen placed behind the barrier. This pattern has become known 
as an interference pattern. See figure 3 for an illustration of the experiment. 
The wave properties of light can be explained by classical electrodynamics. 
(cf. Jackson 2006, Fließbach 2008a)
Much more puzzling for classical physics are the following two versions 
of the double-slit experiment. The first one, done by Davisson and Germer 

52
in 1927, simply used a beam of electrons instead of light and managed to 
demonstrate that this will also yield an interference pattern.
In the second version, a single particle is send through the double-slit at 
a time. This is repeated several hundred or thousand times until one starts 
to see a pattern. One might expect that every particle will pass through one 
of the slits and be detected behind either one. The screen should thus detect 
particles as if half of them go through one slit and half through the other. 
This is, however, not the case. Instead, we still find the same interference 
pattern. This has been demonstrated for a number of particles, includ-
ing photons7, electrons, protons and neutrons (cf. Halliday et al. 2008, 
pp. 1068–1069).

interference (top) and destructive interference (bottom). Image used

53
Even more astonishing is the fact that the interference pattern vanishes 
if we detect through which slit the particle went. In this case we really do 
find the result we’d expect if half of the particles go through one slit, and 
half through the other (cf. Fließbach 2008b, p. 10–12). In the next chapter 
we will see how quantum physics explains these phenomena.

pattern. Image used with the permission of Philip Graemer.
8.  The Quantum Explanation
We will now discuss the basic explanation for these empirical results of-
fered by quantum mechanics. There are of course different interpretations 
of quantum mechanics, some of which we will discuss later. However, this 
section will introduce the earliest attempts of an interpretation, on which 

54
the other attempts are based. First we will discuss the so called wave-particle 
duality and afterwards the Schrödinger equation.
8.1  Wave-Particle Duality
The 1927 experimental detection of interference in electrons goes back to 
an idea of de Broglie, expressed in 1924. Classical electrodynamics had 
treated light as an electromagnetic wave. The early 20th century, however, 
brought the discovery of the photoelectric effect and the Compton effect, 
that demonstrated that light had properties associated with particles such 
as momentum8 (Fließbach 2008b, p. 5–9). De Broglie then suggested that if 
light is a particle, but also has wave characteristics, the same might be the 
case for other particles (Halliday et al. 2008, p. 1068). As we have seen, 
experimental results showed his intuition to be correct. Particles have a de 
Broglie wavelength λ , which is inversely proportional to its momentum 
(ibid.).9
This led to the notion of wave-particle duality. Originally being a wave 
and a particle were seen as contradictory. The former leads one to expect 
an interference pattern when performing a double slit experiment, the latter 
does not. According to the wave-particle duality, a particle moving through 
a double-slit will do so as a wave; however, when it is detected at the screen, 
this will be done as a particle.
We find this description a bit irritating, the problem being the charac-
terisation of a physical entity as a ‘wave’. We should rather consider the 
strict mathematical meaning of the term wave. A wave is nothing but a 
mathematical function that constitutes a solution to the ‘wave equation’. 
Instead of asking ourselves in what way an electron is a wave, we should 
rather ask ourselves what physical attribute of an electron is described by 
a wave function. This is what we will do in the next chapter.

8.2  Schrödinger Equation and Born Rule
The Schrödinger equation
is the basis of quantum physics, directly inferred from empirical evidence. 
We will not explain it in detail, but only give a rough idea of its meaning. 
The Hamilton operator H(q, p, t), describes the system and 
(q, t) is the 
wave function. The wave function describes the state of the system and the 
Schrödinger equation how the state changes in time. Just like in classical 
physics the change of the system is deterministic and continuous, i.e. not 
abrupt. The state can interfere with itself, thus explaining the emergence 
of an interference pattern in the double slit experiment, even when a single 
particle is used.
But can it be explained that a particle is always detected at one location 
on the screen? It is, after all, only after several repetitions and addition of 
the individual detections that we start to see an interference pattern. From 
this we can deduce that it is the probability of detecting a particle at a 
certain place that is related to the interference pattern and thus the wave 
function. The exact relationship is described by the so-called Born rule.
While undergoing measurement, it seems that the state is changed from 
a superposition to one where the particle is localized. Unlike the evolution 
of a system as described by the Schrödinger equation, this evolution of 
a system undergoing measurement is discontinuous and indeterministic 
(Spekkens 2011). We thus have no way of predicting with certainty where a 
particle will be detected. We can only make probabilistic predictions. Unlike 
in classical statistical physics, this uncertainty is not the result of lack of 
information about the state of the system. Even when we have full knowl-
edge of the state, we cannot predict the outcome. Some theories suggest 
that there exist hidden variables which would allow us to predict the out 
come. However, even these theories don’t assume that we can gain knowl-
edge of the hidden variables without measuring first. A detailed discussion 
of hidden variable theories will follow in the section on no-go theorems.
In section 6 we discussed measurement in classical physics. It seems that 
in quantum physics measurement plays a different role, since it influences 
the state of the system in a way not described by the Schrödinger equation. 

56
The role of measurement in quantum physics has been the cause of great 
controversy. Penrose (2004) suggested that there is an unresolved empirical 
issue at hand, while Englert (2013) argues that the so-called measurement 
problem is a pseudo-problem and that no ‘foundational matters are waiting 
to be settled’ (Englert 2013, p. 1).
8.3  Observables
Physical quantities are properties of a system that can be quantified by 
measurement. In quantum physics, these are represented by hermitian  
operators in the so called Hilbert Space. Depending on the author, the 
physical quantities or the mathematical operators representing them are 
referred to as observables (Ismael 2009). The eigenvalues of the Operator 
correspond to the value of the physical quantity. The Born Rule, mentioned 
above, allows for statistical, but not deterministic, prediction of the out-
come of measurement of a certain observable; while the wave function is 
complex, the values of observables are real numbers.
8.4  Einstein-Podolski-Rosen Paradox and  
Quantum Entanglement
In 1935 Einstein, Podolski and Rosen challenged the orthodox interpreta-
tion of quantum mechanics with what has become known as the Einstein-
Podolski-Rosen Paradox (Einstein et al. 1935). In their minds quantum 
mechanics as understood at the time would require action at a distance, 
i.e. that an event at some location has an instant physical effect on events 
elsewhere. Special relativity, however, seemed to suggest that the effect of 
any event can only spread with the speed of light, but never instantaneously. 
The effect they described has become known as ‘quantum entanglement’ 
and has been empirically demonstrated. However, the interpretation offered 
by Einstein et al. is largely deemed impossible as we shall see in the next 
chapter. We will now introduce the concept of quantum entanglement and 
discuss its relevance.
Two interacting systems may be described by a single wave function, i.e. 
they are in fact described as a single system. The state of this system may 
be a superposition of two states. Both of these states are a combination of 
states of the subsystems. If both subsystems can either be in the state a or 

57
b the allowed combinations are (a, a), (a, b), (b, a) and (b, b). Let us now 
consider the case where the overall system is in a superposition of (a, a) 
and (b, b). Einstein et al. now considered that after a time of interaction 
the two subsystems are physically separated and one of them is measured. 
Since the overall system is in a superposition of (a, a) and (b, b), and dur-
ing measurement the system will be reduced to one of the states that make 
up the superpositioned state we know that both subsystems will have to 
be in the same state. Measurement of one subsystem thus instantaneously 
influences the other subsystem to be in the state measured.10
This seems to contradict the notion of special relativity, that actions can 
only spread with the speed of light.11 So Einstein et al. instead suggested 
that there are hidden variables which determine which state each subsystem 
is in before they are separated. They promoted what is described as a local 
hidden variable theory. The theory is local, because there is no action at a 
distance. It is a hidden variable theory, because the apparent indetermin-
ism is believed to be the result of hidden variables, and not some objective 
chance in the world. John Stuart Bell is widely regarded as having demon-
strated that such a local hidden variable is impossible. Bell’s theorem and 
another so called no-go theorem will be the subject of the next section.
9.  No-go Theorems
No-go theorems are theorems that forbid certain kinds of quantum physi-
cal theories. By making use of theoretical considerations, they demonstrate 
that some aspects a physical theory might have, would lead to predic-
tions which contradict empirical results. We thus know that all theories 
that contain these aspects must be false. There are two important no-go 
theorems. The first one is Bell’s theorem which states the impossibility of 
a local hidden variable theory which is consistent with the empirical facts 
(Bell 1964). The second theorem is the so-called Kochen-Specker theorem 
10	 Note that whether and along which lines one divides a system into subsystems 
is arbitrary. In the case of the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen Paradox the subsystems 
are chosen so that they are physically far apart in order to demonstrate action 
at a distance.
11	 Since no information can be transmitted faster than light using entanglement 
the contradiction is only apparent.

58
which further limits the possibility of a hidden variable theory (Kochen 
and Specker 1967). We will discuss both these theorems without going in 
any detail about their proofs, which we deem too complex for this context.
9.1  Bell’s Theorem
Bell (1964) builds on the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen paradox. He considers 
the case of particles with entangled ‘spin’. Instead of performing the same 
measurement on both particles, he suggested measuring the spin in different 
directions and examine the correlations between the results. He was able 
to demonstrate, that any local hidden variable theory predicts that these 
correlations adhere to the so-called Bell inequality.
It has, however, been demonstrated empirically that in reality Bell’s in-
equality is violated (Freedman et al. 1972). Instead, the results comply with 
the predictions made by orthodox quantum mechanics. It follows that any 
local hidden variable theory is empirically inadequate, as it cannot account 
for all facts which its alternative can account for. Since orthodox quantum 
mechanics also rejects locality, as demonstrated in the Einstein-Podolski-
Rosen Paradox, this raises strong doubts, not just about a local hidden 
variable theory, but about locality in general.
9.2  Kochen-Specker Theorem
While Bell’s theorem implies that a hidden variable theory must be non-
local, the Kochen-Specker Theorem further limits the kinds of hidden vari-
able theories compatible with quantum mechanics. In our discussion of 
the Kochen-Specker theorem we will largely follow Held (2013). At this 
point we will need to give a more precise statement of what we mean by a 
hidden variable theory. We understand a hidden variable theory to be one 
where value definiteness holds true. Value definiteness, as defined by Held 
(2013) is the following:
‘(VD) All observables defined for a QM system have definite values at all times.’ 
(Held 2013, sec. 1)
This implies that, unlike presented in section 8, measurement doesn’t change 
the values being measured, but it rather reveals values which exist previ-
ous to and independent of measurement. Measurement would thus have 

59
the same role it has in classical physics, which we discussed in section 6.  
Two further principles a quantum theory may or may not satisfy are the 
following:
If A, B and C are compatible observables, then: 
(SR) If C = A + B, then v(C) = v(A) + v(B)
(PR) If C = A ∗ B, then v(C) = v(A) · v(B)
These are called the sum rule and the product rule respectively. v(X) refers 
to the value of the observable X. The sum rule thus states that the value of 
the sum of A and B is equal to the sum of the value of A and the value of 
B. The product rule states the equivalent for multiplication. Both of these 
seem to be plausible demands. They follow from a broader principle called 
the functional composition principle (FUNC), which states that the value 
of any function of an observable is equal to the value of the same function 
of the same observables, or in more formal terms:
(FUNC) ‘Let A be a self-adjoint operator associated with observable A, 
let f: 
 be an arbitrary function, such that f (A) is another self-adjoint 
operator, and let 
 be an arbitrary state; then f (A) is associated uniquely 
with an observable f (A) such that: v(f (A)) 
 = f (v(A)) 
’ (Held 2013, 
sec. 4)
The 
 indicates that the system is in an arbitrary state 
. The Kochen-
Specker theorem, however, states that compliance of (VD), as well as (PR) 
and (SR) contradicts orthodox quantum mechanics (cf. Kochen and Specker 
1967 or Held 2013).
(KS) If quantum mechanics is true, the following two are contradictory:
(1)	 (VD) is true.
(2)	 (SR) and (PR) are true.
So for any hidden variable theory of quantum mechanics, (SR) or (PR) must 
be false. Of course this also implies that the general principle (FUNC) must 
be false. (FUNC) can, however, be deduced from a set of four principles. 
A hidden variable theory must thus reject at least one of these principles. 
The four principles are as follows:
(1)	(STAT FUNC) ‘Given A, f , 
 as defined in FUNC, then, for an arbi-
trary real number b:

60
prob[v(f(A)) 
 = b] = prob[f (v(A)) 
 = b]’ (Held 2013)
(STAT FUNC) is a weaker, probabilistic version of (FUNC). A, f , 
 are 
the same as in (FUNC) and b is an arbitrary real number. It states that the 
probability of the value of f (A) being b is the same as the probability of f  of 
the value of A being b. (STAT FUNC) is implied by the formalism of quan-
tum mechanics. This means that any quantum mechanical theory has to 
imply (STAT FUNC), unless it completely diverges from the original theory.
(2)	(VD) Value Definiteness as defined above.
(3)	(VR) Value Realism: ’If there is an operationally defined real number 
α, associated with a self-adjoint operator A and if, for a given state, 
the statistical algorithm of QM for A yields a real number β with β = 
prob(v(A) = α), then there exists an observable A with value α.’ (Held 
2013, sec. 4)
Quantum mechanics allows us to calculate the probability of a value, given 
the state and the observable. Value Realism implies that if the probability 
calculated for a given operator and real value is real, then the operator 
represents an observable. Rejecting (VR) implies that construction of an 
operator from another operator which represents an observable doesn’t 
automatically lead to another observable. An example would be the energy 
squared, which is constructed from the energy operator. Usually this would 
be an operator that represents an observable, same as energy on its own. If 
we reject value realism this isn’t necessarily the case (Held 2013, sec. 5.2).
(4)	(NC) Noncontextuality: ‘If a QM system possesses a property (value 
of an observable), then it does so independently of any measurement 
context.’ (Held 2013, sec. 4)
Measurement of a noncontextual property thus means determining a value 
which is independent of the fact that measurement is taking place and the 
way measurement is taking place. This is the case with classical measure-
ment as described in section 6. Within a noncontextual theory, you can not 
make sense of a value of an observable without it being measured.

61
10.  Interpretations
There is a variety of interpretations of quantum mechanics. They differ 
mainly in their position on the so-called measurement problem, but also 
in the theoretical entities they assume. The version of quantum physics 
we introduced, is close to the originally dominant interpretations. We will 
thus call it the ‘orthodox interpretation’. The need for further interpreta-
tion derives from the obscurity when it comes to measurement and the 
sense of many that the nature of reality is not adequately described. One 
early interpretation was the so-called Copenhagen Interpretation, which 
is still popular today. The issue has, however, been the focus point of so 
much debate, that there are now actually several interpretations of this 
interpretation.
This section will give an overview of some of the many attempts to 
interpret quantum physics, but before we introduce these interpretations, 
we will discuss the famous Schrödinger’s cat thought experiment, which 
originated much of the controversy regarding measurement. The different 
interpretations can best be explained in regard to their position on the 
thought experiment.
10.1  Schrödinger’s cat
Schrödinger’s cat is a thought experiment, suggested by Erwin Schrödinger 
in 1935 to illustrate absurd consequences of the orthodox interpretation of 
quantum physics (Schrödinger 1935). The experiment requires a ‘quantum 
box’, which shields the inside from interaction with the outside in order to 
create an isolated system. Inside the box is a radioactive source. At what 
point such a source emits radiation depends on quantum mechanical pro-
cesses of chance. The source can thus be used as a generator of chance of 
sort. But as long as the system is not measured, i.e. the box is opened, the 
source has to be seen as being in a superposition state of having emitted 
radiation and not having emitted radiation. Schrödinger further imagines 
a Geiger counter to be inside the box, which detects whether the radiation 
was emitted or not. The system of radiation source and Geiger counter is 
thus in a superposition state of ‘radiation emitted and radiation detected’ 
and ‘radiation not emitted and radiation not detected’. The detector is 
connected to an apparatus in such a way that it breaks a glass with poison 

62
if radiation is detected. Additionally, there is a cat inside the box which 
dies if the poison is released. The whole system is thus in a superposition 
of two states, in one of which the cat is dead and the other alive. We can 
never observe this state though, since once we open the box, the state will 
be reduced to one of the two options.
Is such a superposition of macroscopic objects, like cats, really possible? 
The thought experiment raises the question, at what point a superpositioned 
state is measured and thus reduced to the measured state, if this is what 
happens at all. One possible answers is that the detector is already carrying 
out a measurement. A very strange possible answer is that the cat is measur-
ing, simply because it is a conscious being. Note that in principle, one could 
also replace the cat with a human being. If measurement and reduction is 
taking place within the box, this certainly demands an answer to the ques-
tion, which precise process or interaction constitutes such a measurement?
10.2  Subjectivist Interpretations
Subjectivist interpretations view quantum physics as a tool to predict sub-
jective probability of measurement. In the case of Schrödinger’s cat, this 
tool can be used from the perspective of the Geiger counter, the Cat or the 
person who opens the box. The probabilities will be the same in all cases, 
so there will be no conflict of results. If the probability of radiation being 
emitted is 50%, then there will be a 50% chance for the detector to detect 
radiation, a 50% chance for the cat to inhale to poison and a 50% chance 
for the person who opens to box to find the cat dead. So when we consider 
a measurement to be taking place has no empirical relevance. Some versions 
of the Copenhagen Interpretation are subjectivist.
10.3  Objective-Collapse Interpretations
Objective-Collapse Interpretations hold that there is an objective state of 
the system, which collapses when measured. Collapse theories have to tell 
us at which point a superpositioned system, such as Schrödinger’s cat, 
collapses. Penrose (2004) argues for an objective-collapse interpretation. 
He suggests an experiment, called FELIX, which arguably can not be ac-
counted for by subjectivist interpretations. In it different results will be 
measured, depending on whether a mirror, which is part of the set up, can 

63
be in superposition or not. Penrose argues that whether a state collapses is 
related to the gravitational potential.
10.4  Modal Interpretations
Modal Interpretations, defended among others by Van Fraasen (1991), 
hold that the description of the state through the Schrödinger equation 
is complete. There is no state collapse or reduction, neither in the sub-
jective, nor objective sense. Instead the system has a definite state at all 
times, which evolves deterministically in accordance with the Schrödinger 
equation, including all cases of interaction with particles, which are not 
part of the system. It is merely the values of the observables which are de-
termined by chance. The possibilities of the values of the observables and 
their assigned probabilities are thus implied by the state, hence the name 
modal interpretation.
10.5  Many-Worlds Interpretation
The Many-Worlds Interpretation doesn’t only offer a view on the evolution 
of states, but also interprets them in a certain way (cf. Vaidman 2014). 
According to this Interpretation, first suggested by Everett (1957), the uni-
verse contains many different worlds. Each time a quantum chance event 
takes place, new worlds are created, one for each possible outcome. Super-
positioned states constitute certain interactions between the worlds. So with 
regard to Schrödinger’s cat, there are two worlds, one in which the cat is 
alive and one in which it is dead. In the double slit experiment there is one 
world in which the particle goes through the left slit, and one in which it 
goes through the right slit. However, these two worlds are still linked in a 
way, which explains the possibility of superposition events.
10.6  Hidden-Variable Interpretations
A hidden-variable interpretation is any interpretation, which postulates un-
known variables, which determine the apparently indeterministic processes 
in quantum physics. The hidden variables are not only unknown, but un-
knowable before measurement. Hidden-variable interpretations thus don’t 
allow us to make additional predictions about measurement results. It 

64
is only after measurement we can decide which hidden state the system 
was previously in. The apparent randomness is thus thought to be due to 
epistemic chance as in classical statistical physics, and not objective chance. 
As opposed to classical statistical physics complete knowledge of the state 
is not only impossible for technical reasons but in principle.
As discussed in section 9, the possibility of hidden variable theories 
is limited by so-called no-go theorems. The local hidden variable theory 
imagined by Einstein et al. (1935) is forbidden by Bell’s theorem. An in­
terpretation which is not forbidden by any no-go theorem is the de Broglie- 
Bohm theory (cf. Goldstein 2013).
As in the orthodox interpretation, the de Broglie-Bohm theory includes a 
wave function governed by the Schrödinger equation. Unlike in the ortho-
dox interpretation a full description of the system also includes an actual 
position of the particle. The movement of the particle is described by an 
additional equation, called the guiding equation, which depends on the 
wave function. One could say that the wave function guides the particle. In 
a double slit experiment with a single particle, the outcome is already de-
termined by the original position of the particle. However, this position can 
only be known in hindsight, i.e. after the experiment has been performed.
10.7  Operational Approach
While all interpretations discussed so far included a description of a state of 
a system, the operational approach doesn’t intend to describe such a state 
at all (cf. Spekkens 2011). Instead the aim is to devise rules which allow to 
predict the results of measurements based on the experimental set up. The 
experiment is divided up into the preperation and the measurement. The 
former describes the way the system is prepared and the second the way it 
is measured, i.e. the measurement set up. Every action on the system has 
to be described as part of the preparation or the measurement. The goal is 
now to simply find rules which allow (probabilistic) prediction of measure-
ment results, based on knowledge of preparation and measurement set up.

65
Part III.  Reflections on Quantum Physics
In this part, we will use some of the philosophical foundations laid in part 1 
to reflect on quantum physics and its various interpretations. First, we will 
discuss various questions related to theory and observation in quantum 
physics. Then, we will ask whether quantum physics is acceptable, despite 
various ‘odd’ characteristics. Finally, we will discuss ontological questions 
related to quantum physics. We will suggest that some of these thoughts 
may be relevant to attempts to combine quantum physics with gravitational 
theory.
11.  Theory and Observation in Quantum Physics
11.1  Observables and Observation
Their name may suggest that ‘observables’ are observational terms, but is 
this really the case? As we discussed in section 8.3, observables are measur-
able physical quantities. Does this qualify them as observations? The answer 
is clearly no, since measurement and observation are not the same. We shall 
discuss the difference, as well as the relationship between measurement and 
observation and thereby establish the status of observables as theoretical 
terms, which are, however, more directly linked to observations than other 
theoretical terms.
When a physical system undergoes measurement, it interacts with a 
measuring device, which changes in a way that is linked to the aspect of 
the system being measured. The change of the measuring device must be 
observable. We explicated this classical notion of measurement in section 6. 
It is clear that the aspect of the system being measured, which in quantum 
mechanics is the observable, is not itself content of our observation. Physi-
cists will in general observe a graphic or numerical representation of the 
measurement results on a computer screen, but certainly not the observable 
directly.
Another way to demonstrate that measurement is not observation is 
through the criterion of ostensive learnability. The terms used to describe 
measurement results are not ostensively learnable. There is no ostensive 
learning experiment that has any chance of teaching someone the meaning 

66
of ‘momentum’ or what it means for an unobservable particle to have the 
momentum 1 Ns.12
We have, however, seen that measurement seems to play a slightly differ-
ent role in quantum physics, a role which is still the subject of controversy. 
Two hypothetical differences we should consider are the following:
(a)	 Measurement has an effect on the physical system which is not in ac-
cordance with its normal evolution.
(b)	 The observables have no values independent of measurement.
The different interpretations we learned about in section 10 imply differ-
ent views on whether these are true. (b) constitutes a rejection of value 
definiteness, which we will discuss again in section 12.2. For now, all that 
needs to concern us is whether (a) or (b) change anything about the status 
of observables as theoretical terms. That this is not the case doesn’t require 
great explanation. The reasons given above for observables not being ob-
servational terms are independent of (a) and (b).
Even though observables are not observational terms, they are nonethe-
less linked more closely to observation than other theoretical constructs in 
quantum physics, such as the wave function. Observables can be measured 
and measurement can result in some observable change in the measurement 
apparatus, or a device linked to it such as a computer screen. So, the link 
from observables to observation is relatively brief. The wave function, on 
the other hand, can only be used to predict the probability of measuring cer-
tain values of observables. It is thus one step further away from observation.
11.2  Theory or Interpretation?
In section 10 we referred to the different versions of quantum physics as 
interpretations. But when do different interpretations of a theory stop being 
mere interpretations and become separate theories? The answer given by 
Van Fraasen (1991, pp. 241–244) is that two different theories make differ-
ent empirical predictions, while two interpretations of the same theory agree 
on the empirical predictions, but disagree on matters which are beyond 
empirical phenomena. One might say that the interpretation describes a 
12	 Ns is Newton seconds, the unit of momentum.

67
structure of reality which is in accordance with the empirical predictions 
of the theory. We will distinguish this matter further in the next section. 
What is important is that the interpretation makes a stronger claim than 
the theory by itself.
Van Fraasen (1991, p. 243) further claims that ‘attempts to interpret 
are very much like, if not the same thing as, attempts to introduce hidden 
variables’. The idea is that the additional content of an interpretation is be-
yond the empirical phenomena and thus a hidden variable. Hidden variable 
theories are, however, a much more specific kind of theory. As introduced in 
section 10.6, they attempt to explain the apparently indeterministic nature 
of quantum mechanics through the existence of definite hidden variables. 
Knowledge of these variables, although not necessarily believed to be ac-
cessible, would in principle allow for deterministic prediction. But not all 
interpretations assume determinism. The collapse theory and modal theory 
have a theoretical structure which goes beyond empirical phenomena, in-
cluding for example the wave function. They are nonetheless indeterministic 
and don’t assume value definiteness.
Penrose (2004, pp. 782–784), for example, is unsatisfied with main-
stream views on quantum mechanics, because they tell us ‘essentially noth-
ing about an actual quantum reality of the world’ (Penrose 2004, p. 782). 
But the description of reality offered by him includes an indeterministic evo-
lution of the quantum state. This is in no way contradictory to his realism.
The distinction between theory and interpretation offered by Van Fraasen 
is certainly possible. It does, however, imply that two interpretations of the 
same theory may have a completely different and contradictory theoretical 
structure. It may well be argued that this should be sufficient to classify 
them as distinct theories. Van Fraasen himself seems to do this in ‘The Sci-
entific Image’ (Van Fraasen 1980, pp. 10–11). In the end this boils down to 
pure semantics. For this reason, we don’t pay particular attention to when 
we use the word ‘theory’ and when ‘interpretation’. What is important is 
that according to the realist and literal reading of theories, two theories or 
interpretation are significantly distinct from one an other if they have con-
tradictory theoretical structures. Whether one classifies them as opposing 
theories or merely interpretations of the same theory is a matter of choice.
There is, however, a major problem with classifying some of the views on 
quantum physics. They hold different views on the measurement problem. 

68
This means that they disagree on something which is neither an empirical 
matter, nor a matter of description of reality. The disagreement is about 
whether the orthodox view of quantum physics is complete or not. Someone 
in favour of the collapse view may for example hold that the subjectivist 
view is incomplete, because there are empirically relevant cases for which 
the subjectivist can not account. The subjectivist would disagree on the 
existence of such cases. The point of the collapse theorist would not be 
that there is empirical evidence contrary to the subjectivist view, it is rather 
that there supposedly are cases for which it is nor clear which empirical 
predictions follow from the subjectivist interpretation.
11.3  Theory and Ontology
We believe that the dichotomy of empirical theory and realist interpretation 
requires further differentiation. As we have argued through out part 1, the 
theoretical structure of a theory doesn’t have to be interpreted in the realist 
sense. But neither is it simply observation. So, there is room for interpreta-
tion which is not occupied with a description of the ‘real’ world. We suggest 
that, besides the empirical aspect of quantum theory, one should recognise 
an ontology as well as a theoretical structure.
In section 5 we introduced scientific realism as the notion that theoreti-
cal entities refer to real (mind-independent) objects. So, scientific realists 
believe that the theoretical structure represents some aspect of reality. This 
is the ontology. For a scientific realist, theoretical structure and ontology 
are thus closely linked. We think that a distinction is necessary anyway, for 
two reasons. The first is that not everyone accepts scientific realism. The 
second is that scientific realists who agree upon a theoretical structure, may 
still hold opposing views on what aspects of it are representations of reality 
and how they represent it.
The interpretations of quantum physics we discussed imply different 
theoretical structures. Most notably they differ on how the wave function 
evolves and how it is linked to observables. In the collapse interpretation 
the wave function collapses at some point, while in the modal interpre-
tation it evolves continuously. During collapse the wave changes in an 
indeterministic way. The resulting state of the system yields the value of a 
measured observable. In the modal interpretation the wave function doesn’t 

69
change in an indeterministic manner, but the value of an observable can not 
be deterministically predicted by the wave function.
Proponents of the many-worlds interpretation suggest that the super-
posed states correspond to different worlds and that all possible outcomes, 
even those not realized in our world, are real in some world. This should 
be seen as a question of ontology. It clearly surpasses a mere description 
of the evolution of the quantum state. It also includes a description of the 
reality which is believed to underlie the theoretical structure.
11.4  Structural Correspondences of Interpretations
It is not entirely clear if all the interpretations we discussed make the same 
empirical predictions under all possible circumstances. But they do agree 
on a wide range of empirical matters. Otherwise it would be a matter of a 
few simple experiments to falsify some of them.
Section 5.6.3 discussed intertheoretical correspondences. It seems plau-
sible that the interpretations of quantum physics, which agree upon a wide 
range of empirical phenomena, should have some theoretical correspond-
ences between them. It turns out that the wave function and the Schrödinger 
equation play a central role in all the interpretations we discussed. The 
interpretations vary in two aspects:
(a)	 Under which conditions, if any, the wave function evolves divergent of 
the Schrödinger equation.
(b)	 How the wave function is related to observables.
Disregarding these differences, the wave function is still an essential aspect 
of all these interpretations. It is fair to say that this intertheoretical cor-
respondence explains the shared empirical success. Phenomena such as the 
interference pattern in the double slit experiment are typical wave phenom-
ena. Therefore, it comes as little surprise that a wave function plays a key 
role in many if not all theories that are able to explain these phenomena.
12.  Is Quantum Physics Acceptable?
Quantum physics is able to explain a wide range of empirical phenomena. 
However, it brings with it some strange consequences such as indetermin-
ism and arguably also the rejection of value definiteness. In addition, some 

70
commentators on the measurement problem suggest that quantum physics 
is incomplete. This raises the question whether quantum physics is an ac-
ceptable theory. We will discuss the three mentioned issues in turn.
12.1  Indeterminism
Newtonian physics was arguably one of the greatest advances in the physi-
cal sciences. No previous theory was as all-embracing as the physics of 
Newton. The movement of all objects could be understood as compliant 
with a very limited and fairly simple set of deterministic laws. Newton 
impacted the understanding of science itself to such an extent that science 
arguably became synonymous with explanation through deterministic laws. 
While this effect of Newtonian theory on our thinking about science is 
understandable, it is only partially justified. Explanation and prediction of 
individual phenomena through more abstract laws is undoubtedly a key 
aspect of scientific methodology, but it is by no means necessary that these 
laws are deterministic. Quantum physics is an example for this.
Without a certain uniformity of the world, science is impossible, since we 
would be unable to derive empirically adequate, abstract laws. But a deter-
ministic uniformity, in other words a uniformity, not just of probabilities, 
but of actual phenomena, is by no means necessary. Probabilistic laws are 
not as rich in content as deterministic laws, since they don’t contain certain, 
positive information about what will happen under given circumstances. 
But they have content nonetheless and thus do constitute substantial insight.
That there are uniformities in the world at all is not given a priori, since 
it is not logically necessary. So we should count ourselves lucky that science 
is as successful as it is. If we now also demand that observable phenomena 
be explainable by deterministic laws, that is just asking for way more than 
we can expect. It would no doubt be convenient if this was possible. But 
something being convenient doesn’t necessarily make it true. Newtonian 
physics gave us too high expectations of what science can achieve. Now 
we have to lower them.
This doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t look for deterministic explanations. 
They are after all richer in content and finding them would thus constitute 
an advancement. We just shouldn’t be surprised if we don’t find determin-
istic explanations. There is no necessity for them to exist. It is likely that 

71
for quantum physics the search is futile. Even the so-called hidden variable 
theories don’t assume that we can ever make deterministic predictions about 
quantum phenomena. They only assume that the underlying theoretical 
structure or reality is deterministic.
12.2  Value Definiteness
We have seen in section 9 that there are strong problems when trying to 
construct a version of quantum physics in which value definiteness holds 
true. There are some hidden-variable theories like the De Broglie-Bohm 
theory, which are not contradictory to the Kochen-Specker theorem. But 
nonetheless, we have to consider the possibility of abandoning value defi-
niteness. In this section, we will try to get a clearer picture of what this 
implies and whether a version of quantum physics where it doesn’t hold 
true could be acceptable.
An account of a hypothetical measurement which would force us to 
either reject value definiteness or basic principles of logic is given by  
Van Fraasen (1991, p. 107–108). Imagine there are three observables, which 
we can measure in principle. Let us call them A, B and C. In quantum physics 
it is common that certain observables can’t be measured simultaneously. Let 
us assume that in this case we can measure any two of the three observables 
at once, but never all three at once. For all three observables we can expect 
any value from 0 to 1. We repeat the experiment several times for each pair 
of observables. Consider now we find that for the pair A and B we always 
find that in half of the cases the measured value of A is 0 and that of B is 
1. In the other half of the cases it is the other way around, i.e. A has the 
value 1 and B has the value 0. We can now make clear probabilistic pre-
dictions about the results. Now let us say that for the other two pairs we 
find exactly the same results. We can derive the following two statements 
from our findings:
(a)	 ‘No two of A, B, C have the same value.’
(b)	 ‘Each of A, B, C has value 0 or 1.’ (Van Fraasen 1991, p. 107)
Clearly these two statements are contradictory. If A, B and C all have either 
value 0 or 1, then it is necessary that at least two of them share the same 
value. So how do we deal with such a contradiction?

72
The most obvious response would be to say that such a scenario, since it 
implies a logical contradiction, cannot exist. Since this particular scenario 
was made up by Van Fraasen and doesn’t constitute a real experiment, 
there is no problem. There are, however, similar, real cases discussed in 
the literature.
It also seems counter-intuitive to think that a series of measurement 
results can ever constitute a logical contradiction. What logical principle 
could ever forbid certain measurement results in a series of experiments? 
Certainly this is not possible. It is only our interpretation of the results that 
can be illogical. So, instead of rejecting classical logic and trying to find 
non-classical logics to replace it (as some authors do), we should re-examine 
the hidden assumptions that led us to postulate (a) and (b), which, without 
doubt, really are contradictory.
Van Fraasen identifies two hidden assumptions that leads us to (a) and 
(b). The first is value definiteness, i.e. that A, B and C have values independ-
ent of measurement. The second is that measurement faithfully reveals those 
values. Let us have a brief look at the latter first. If A, B and C have values 
independent of measurement, but these are not revealed by measurement, 
then it can’t really be considered measurement of A, B and C. What ever 
else this process might reveal – it is not a measurement of A, B and C. We 
might instead call the quantities we measure A’, B’ and C’. But now we have 
just moved the problem to these new observables. The statements (a) and 
(b) now hold true for them. So rejecting the second principle without also 
rejecting value definiteness offers no real solution.
We thus have to choose between basic principles of classical logic and 
value definiteness. Van Fraasen chooses logic. But is a rejection of value 
definiteness acceptable? In the case of the double slit experiment, discussed 
in section 7, this implies that if we don’t measure through which slit the 
particle goes it doesn’t have any location at all. But why should it always 
have a location? This may be contrary to the thinking about location in 
classical physics, which is also a lot closer to the way we think about it in 
our every day life. But it is by no means contrary to scientific reasoning. 
As part of a scientific theory we may well postulate quantities which only 
have values when measured. This still allows for (probabilistic) prediction 
of the outcomes of measurements. In section 13.1 we will argue that it is 
also compatible with the notion of realism.

73
12.3  Measurement Problem
While we should have no problem with indeterminism or the rejection of 
value definiteness, the question remains whether quantum physics is com-
plete. So, the question is not if quantum physics has some consequences 
which might be considered undesirable, such as indeterminism or the rejec-
tion of value definiteness. Instead we have to ask whether quantum theory 
can stand by itself as a theory with wide ranging empirical consequences.
What is perceived as a problem by some, is the lack of a clear description 
of the process of measurement in quantum physics. The two main issues 
appear to be:
(a)	 Does measurement influence the quantum mechanical state in a way 
that is not described by the Schrödinger Equation?
(b)	Under what conditions does such a measurement occur?
Penrose (2004, pp. 856–865) suggests the so-called FELIX experiment to 
test his hypothesis on how gravity influences a collapse of the wave func-
tion. To our knowledge, such an experiment has not been conducted to 
this day, due to difficulties in its realisation. The basic idea is ‘to construct 
a ‘Schrödinger’s cat’ that consists of a tiny mirror M, placed in a quantum 
superposition of two slightly different locations’ (Penrose 2004, p. 856). 
The experimental set up is supposed to ensure that a superposed mirror 
and a collapsed mirror will yield different measurements of light reflected 
from the mirror. Penrose gives a more detailed description of the experiment 
and suggests that the outcome depends on the gravitational potential of the 
mirror. Like in the Schrödinger’s cat thought experiment, a macroscopic 
superposition is induced. The difference is that in this case we should be 
able to experimentally verify whether the object was in superposition or not 
and thus at what point a ‘collapse’ of the wave function takes place. This 
contradicts the notion held by proponents of the subjectivist interpreta-
tion (cf. section 10.2) that it does not matter at what point ‘measurement’ 
takes place.
Others, like Englert (2013), argue that there aren’t really any problems 
with standard quantum theory. No fundamental issues need to be solved. 
We are unable to resolve this matter here and now, but it is fair to say that 

74
even if their is no real problem, at least there are some issues that need to 
be made clearer in order for everyone to accept it as a pseudo-problem.
13.  Ontology of Quantum Physics
In this section, we will discuss the ontological status of quantum theory. 
We will first discuss what implications the rejection of value definiteness 
would have for a realist or literal view on quantum physics. Afterwards, we 
will pay attention to the different interpretations introduced in section 10. 
We will be asking how compatible they are with the different ontological 
viewpoints, including realism, instrumentalism and the position advanced 
by us in section 5.7. According to our view scientific theories shouldn’t be 
considered a descriptions of reality, but should nonetheless be taken liter-
ally. In the final subsection we will argue that such literalness is potentially 
important for resolving unsolved issues in quantum physics, such as the 
unification of quantum physics and gravity.
13.1  Value Definiteness and Ontology
Does the rejection of value definiteness imply a rejection of realism? Argu-
ably observables can not reference real properties of real objects if they 
don’t have values independent of measurement. There are still the possibili-
ties that either the real objects only have the properties during measurement, 
or that the objects themselves only exist during measurement. Both views 
are not necessarily contradictory to realism. This would, however, be a very 
limited form of realism, which doesn’t correspond to what most realists 
have in mind. After all, a realist wants to discover an independent reality, 
and not one that is created through measurement.
A more fruitful way to save realism is by saying that not all theoretical 
terms and entities need to have a real reference. Just because certain theo-
retical entities, such as observables don’t have real reference, doesn’t mean 
that others can’t have them either. We think the most obvious candidate 
for real reference is the wave state. A quantum mechanical system is always 
in a definite state, even if this state doesn’t include a definite location or 
momentum. So, one may well take this theoretical state to correspond to 
an actual state of reality. Realists have to accept that quantum reality looks 
very different to the reality pictured by classical physics, and that terms like 

75
location and momentum are not a part of it or at least play a very different 
role. Accepting this should be easy for constructive realists, who already 
limit their realism to certain structural correspondences between theory 
and reality.
We have argued in section 5.6.5 that realism should be rejected because 
it adds no empirical content. Theories should nonetheless be taken liter-
ally in order to allow for further research, based on such a literal reading. 
For the same reason realists should take the wave state as corresponding 
to reality, we think the wave state is what should be taken literally. The 
difference between our view and realism is, as always, that we don’t take 
this state to reference reality. The literal interpretation of the wave state 
serves as a basis for further research. The matter of open issues in physics 
will be discussed further in subsection 13.3.
As we have seen, value definiteness is not necessary for a constructive 
realist reading of quantum theory. It seems that resistance to the rejection of 
value definiteness might be motivated by a naive understanding of realism. 
According to naive realism, reality is exactly as we experience it (cf. section 
5.2.1). The values of observables measured by us, one might follow, thus 
also have to be part of reality.
It is, however, questionable whether value definiteness actually follows 
even from a naive form of realism. As we have argued in section 11.1, 
statements about the values of observables are not actually statements 
about observation. They are in fact theoretical statements, even though 
they are more directly linked to observation than the wave state. So, ob-
servables are not observations. It follows that, while naive realism might 
be a motivation for defending value definiteness, it is not a justification of 
it. Independent values are not required by naive realism, since these values 
are not observations.
Even if naive realism required a commitment to value definiteness from 
us, the problem quantum mechanics poses for value definiteness remains. 
If some forms of realism really require us to hang onto value definiteness, 
maybe it is time to reject such forms of realism. Besides various anti-realist 
views, more sophisticated forms of realism, such as constructive realism 
pose an alternative. Modern science, and quantum mechanics in particular, 
demand an ontology which allows for a more complex reality. This is par-
ticularly so since observations are often, especially in quantum mechanics, 

76
very indirect. If we want any part of quantum mechanics to be real, then 
reality certainly needs to have a more complex relationship to observation 
than a simple ‘reality is just as we perceive it’.
13.2  Interpretations and Ontology
This section will deal with the different interpretations of quantum mechan-
ics and their compatibility with the various ontological view points. Our 
ontological views may guide which interpretations we deem acceptable. If 
they are incompatible we may reject the interpretation of quantum mechan-
ics a priori. We will, however, argue that most of the interpretations are 
largely ontologically neutral.
13.2.1  Subjectivist Interpretations
The subjectivist interpretations can be seen as examples of logical positiv-
ism or instrumentalism. At what point measurement takes place is deemed 
irrelevant on the ground that it changes nothing about the probabilistic 
prediction. The subjectivist interpretation thus serves fine from an instru-
mentalist point of view. A literal or realist reading on the other hand seems 
at first sight impossible, since it doesn’t offer a single state, which can be 
said to be the state of the system. Instead there are several states, depending 
on the point we consider measurement to be taking place.
We believe that it should, however, be possible to construct a single state 
from the many states in the subjectivist interpretation. One way to do this 
would be to form an ensemble of all the individual states. While none of 
the individual states can be said to be more significant than the others, we 
could read this ensemble literally or even consider it to correspond to real-
ity in some way. The ensemble would include all the individual states and 
thus all relevant information. Such an ensemble is not included in the clas-
sical subjectivist interpretation, but this goes to show that the subjectivist 
interpretation is not in principle contradictory to a literal or realist reading. 
We believe that the real conflict between the subjectivist interpretation and 
the objective-collapse interpretation concerns their different takings on the 
measurement problem, not ontology. This doesn’t mean that they don’t 
imply very different descriptions of reality. But the subjectivist interpreta-
tion is not inherently linked to a rejection of realism. We will argue in the 

77
next section that such an ontological neutrality holds true for the objective 
collapse interpretation, too.
13.2.2  Objective-Collapse Interpretations
The objective-collapse interpretations are often regarded as realist interpre-
tations. In fact, one of the main motivations for proposing an objective-
collapse interpretation cited by Penrose (2004, p. 782 ff.) is that he is 
unsatisfied with the lack of a clear description of reality of other inter-
pretations. But just because the objective-collapse interpretation implies a 
fairly clear description of a state, doesn’t mean it presupposes realism. We 
can accept its theoretical structure and empirical consequences without 
believing that this theoretical structure references an independent reality. 
It is thus also ontologically neutral. We can take the theoretical structure 
literally, without implying realism or we can accept it as a useful instrument 
for empirical prediction. This doesn’t even need to imply a literal reading. 
While realism does require a proper description of reality, instrumentalism 
doesn’t necessarily require a lack of such a description. It can always treat 
this description as a framework for prediction, without associating any 
larger meaning with it. A literal reading goes slightly further in the direc-
tion of realism, because it doesn’t treat two different theoretical structures 
with identical empirical content as equal.
An instrumentalist acceptance of the objective-collapse interpretation 
thus accepts it as equally valid to all other interpretations which are empiri-
cally equivalent. It may be favoured or disfavoured for pragmatic reasons 
such as its comprehensibleness and difficulty of calculation in its math-
ematical framework. A literal acceptance also implies a commitment to the 
objective-collapse interpretation as a basis for further research.
A realist or literal reading of the objective-collapse interpretation implies 
realness or literalness of the wave function, since the wave function is seen 
as objectively collapsing. We have endorsed the view that the wave state 
should be taken literally in section 13.1 and thus see this as a positive aspect 
of the objective-collapse interpretation. Whether one should favour an ob-
jective-collapse interpretation over other interpretations which allow to 
take the wave state literally does, however, ultimately depend on what one 
makes of its taking on the measurement problem. Penrose (2004, p. 816 ff.)  

78
offers a very specific view on the conditions of collapse and empirical ways 
to test it. Acceptance of his interpretation can thus not solely be based on 
ontological considerations.
13.2.3  Modal Interpretations
Modal interpretations allow for a realist or literal reading of the wave 
function. Unlike with objective-collapse interpretations, the wave func-
tion is not subject to collapse, but behaves completely in accordance with 
the Schrödinger equation. So, there are important theoretical differences 
between modal and objective-collapse interpretations. Observables don’t 
correspond deterministically to certain wave states and can thus be said to 
be completely distinct theoretical entities. The possibilities of ontological 
interpretation are, however, essentially the same. The wave function can 
be regarded as corresponding with reality; it can be taken literally without 
implying any connection with a mind-independent reality, or the whole 
theoretical structure can be seen as a mere instrument for prediction. Van 
Fraasen (1991, p. 273 ff.) is one proponent of a modal interpretation. He 
is also a defender of a literal, but not realist reading of scientific theories 
(cf. Van Fraasen 1980). A realist or instrumentalist reading of the modal 
interpretation is, however, also possible.
13.2.4  Many-Worlds Interpretation
In section 11.3 we differentiated between theory and ontology. This dis-
tinction is particularly important with regard to the many-worlds inter-
pretation. The many-worlds interpretation, besides having a particular 
theoretical structure, postulates that certain elements of that structure con-
stitute different worlds. This is the ontology. For the theoretical structure, 
one might in principle say the same, we have said for the objective-collapse 
and modal interpretations, i.e. that it can be read in a realist, literal or 
instrumentalist manner. The idea that there really are different worlds is, 
however, clearly a realist notion. It may in principle be possible to have a 
realist reading of the same theoretical structure, which doesn’t imply such 
worlds. But the postulate of many-worlds is closely associated with this 
interpretation, which explains its name.

79
Besides our general criticism of scientific realism expressed in section 5.6.5, 
we think that the ontology of the many-worlds interpretation is particularly 
speculative. Constructive realists limit themselves to postulating certain struc-
tural correspondences between theories and reality. But the many-worlds 
interpretation goes so far as to postulate the existence of multiple worlds. 
This seems to be a quite extensive ontology with no, or at least very limited, 
empirical consequences. It is highly doubtful that proponents will ever be 
able to present sufficient justification for it.
13.2.5  Hidden-Variable Interpretations
The de Broglie-Bohm theory is praised by Penrose as being ‘much more 
down to Earth’ (Penrose 2004, p. 789) than other interpretations. What 
he means is that it is much closer to the kind of clear description of real-
ity, which he aspires to. He perceives a weakness in the existence of ‘two 
levels of reality’ (ibid.), one being the particle with an actual position, the 
other being the guiding wave. There is a parallel to the modal interpreta-
tion, which treats the wave function and the observable as two separate 
entities. Penrose deems such a splitting of reality unnecessary. As with 
the other interpretations a literal or instrumentalist reading is, however, 
also possible.
The defining characteristic of all hidden-variable interpretations is that 
all quantities are considered to have definite values at all times and that 
evolution of the state and measurement outcome is guided by deterministic 
laws. As we have argued in section 12.1, these aspects are, however, not 
necessary for scientific realism or science in general. Determinism and value 
definiteness can thus not be used to justify hidden-variable theories over 
other interpretations of quantum physics.
13.2.6  Operational Approach
For all interpretations so far, we have argued that they are to a large ex-
tent ontologically neutral. There is, however, a decisive difference when it 
comes to operational approaches. The idea of an operational approach is 
that it doesn’t yield a description of a state of a system. Instead, it merely 
offers a way to calculate measurement outcome based on the experimental 
preparation. This is a very instrumentalist approach, that doesn’t allow 

80
for a realist or literal reading. If there is no state, but only measurement 
outcomes, then there is nothing which can be said to correspond with 
reality or be taken literally. While as we have argued, a description of a 
theoretical state doesn’t necessarily require a realist or literal reading of that 
state, the absence of a state does imply instrumentalism. Even a realist may 
adopt an operational approach to calculate measurement outcomes. But 
he can never be satisfied by an operational approach alone, because it says 
nothing about the structure of reality. In the same way there is nothing to 
be taken literally, on which further research could be based. Operational 
approaches, one might argue, correspond to crude collection of empirical 
facts and have nothing to do with the abstract theorizing so crucial for the 
advancement of the sciences.
13.2.7  Interpretations and Ontological Parsimony
We have argued that most interpretations are compatible with all ontologi-
cal positions. It follows that we can not dismiss these interpretations based 
on an incompatibility with whatever ontological position we deem to be 
right. Ontology may however still have something to say about choice of 
interpretation if we aspire ontological parsimony. The problem with onto-
logical parsimony is that it is often difficulty to decide which theory is more 
parsimonious. It is easy to reject theories with entirely superfluous elements 
in favour of a reduced version of the theory. But this is a very specific case 
and it is not applicable if there are two theoretical structures or ontolo-
gies which are simply different, without one being a simpler version of the 
other. So, ontological parsimony can be of very limited use for choosing 
an interpretation of quantum physics. There are however two arguments 
which might be applied:
(1)	The many-worlds interpretations may be rejected on the basis that 
many worlds are more extensive than one world.
(2)	Penrose (Ibid.) argued that hidden-variable interpretations are more 
extensive than the collapse interpretation because they contain two 
states; the state of the particle and the guiding wave. This argument 
may also be applied to the modal interpretation because observables 
are not deterministically linked to a wave state and thus, one might 
argue, constitute separate entities.

81
13.3  Literalness and the Challenge of Quantum Gravity
An important open issue in modern physics is the combination of quantum 
theory with gravity, creating a unified theory of quantum gravity. This has 
proven problematic, as the two theories seem incompatible. We believe that 
the interpretation of quantum physics we choose and that we take it liter-
ally may be important in the process of finding a solution to this problem.
One of the reasons finding a theory of quantum gravity proves so hard is 
that the matter has very limited empirical implications, making it very dif-
ficult to collect empirical data on the subject. This means that an empirical 
generalization from already collected data is impossible. We do, however, 
have quantum theory and the theory of general relativity, which are both 
empirically very successful. If we take their theoretical structures literally, 
and not merely as predictive instruments, we can try to combine them in 
various ways. Combined theories created this way may yield specific ways 
to test them empirically. By proceeding this way, we don’t have to collect 
large amounts of data before being able to formulate a first promising hy-
pothesis. Instead, we can collect specific data to test a specific hypothesis.
As mentioned before, combining quantum theory and gravitational 
theory turns out to be not so easy. This may be due to physicists assum-
ing wrong theoretical structures. Maybe certain theoretical structures are 
simply impossible (or at least very hard) to combine. Choosing a different 
theoretical structure may yield different results. Penrose (2004, p. 817) 
writes on the subject:
‘The usual perspective, with regard to the proposed marriage between these theo-
ries, is that one of them, namely general relativity, must submit itself to the will 
of the other. There appears to be the common view that the rules of quantum field 
theory are immutable, and it is Einstein’s theory that must bend itself appropriately 
to fit into the standard quantum mould. Few would suggest that the quantum 
rules must themselves admit to modification, in order to ensure an appropriately 
harmonious marriage. […] Yet, I would claim that there is observational evidence 
that Nature’s view of this union is very different from this!’
So, according to Penrose, quantum mechanics has to be revised in order 
to make it compatible with gravity. Another author who suggests that a 
revisiting of the foundations of quantum physics might be due is Flori 
(2013, p. 2 ff.). Such a revision may also solve any conceptual problems 

82
which might exist in relation to the measurement problem. Flori (2013, 
p. 2) notes:
‘For the supporters of the claim that indeed there are conceptual problems pre-
sent in quantum theory, it seems reasonable to try solving fundamental issues 
before attempting to define a quantum theory of gravity.’
Flori regards Topos Quantum Theory as a promising new formalism for 
quantum mechanics in light of the challenge of a theory of quantum gravity. 
Penrose, on the other hand, counts on his objective collapse interpretation. 
We believe that as long as the matter is not resolved empirically it is good 
that there are a variety of competing research paradigms. This increases 
the chance of one of them turning out to be right. Hopefully even more 
approaches will develop in the near future.
14.  Conclusion
Quantum physics has thrown doubt on some principles, which we didn’t 
necessarily doubt before. While determinism and value definiteness are seen 
by some to be necessary parts of a physical theory, we have argued that this 
is not the case. These principles are neither necessary for gaining scientific 
knowledge, nor should we expect the world to accord with them.
Support for one of the many interpretations of quantum physics should 
therefore not be based on these principles. Both conformance and non-
conformance with them is acceptable and can thus not serve as a justifica-
tion for choice of one theory over its alternatives. We have also argued 
that (except for operational approaches) all interpretations of quantum 
mechanics are more or less compatible with all discussed ontological posi-
tions. So ontology is no decisive ground for theory choice either. Instead, 
choice of interpretation should mainly be based on the position one takes 
on the measurement problem – even if the position is that there isn’t actu-
ally any real problem.
It was not the aim of this work to resolve the measurement problem. We 
will, however, say that it seems odd (if not impossible) for a deterministic 
equation like the Schrödinger equation to give rise to non-deterministic phe-
nomena unless there are some non-deterministic defiances of the Schrödinger 
equation. This suggests some sort of indeterministic mechanism, such as a 
collapse of the wave function.

83
We have argued that scientific theories should be taken literally, i.e. 
contradictory theoretical structures should be recognised as significantly 
distinct, even if they yield identical empirical consequences. They corre-
spond to different research programs and may yield different results when 
developed further or combined with other theories. In the case of quantum 
mechanics, this may be relevant for the development of a theory of quan-
tum gravity. Success in the field may depend on a restructuring of quantum 
mechanics and in particular resolution of any conceptual problems that 
may remain.

Part 2: Quantum Logic


93
Introduction
This part of the book examines approaches to quantum logic which con-
sider classical logic to be defeated by the findings of quantum mechanics 
and therefore propose a new logical system to deal with quantum mechani-
cal phenomena or even replace classical logic. Classical logic is based on 
two fundamental principles: (a) the principle of bivalence, according to 
which one of the two truth values (true and false) can be assigned to every 
proposition – independent of our ability to know which of the values a 
certain proposition has, and (b) the principle of extensionality, according 
to which the truth value of compound sentences is determined by the truth 
values of its components. The findings in the area of quantum mechanics, 
namely Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, do not allow for a sentence like 
“The electron e can be found at position x and has a momentum p.” to 
be assigned the truth value true. When the position of a particle has been 
determined, an equally exact determination of the momentum is impossible. 
Further, quantum objects are subject to wave-particle duality, meaning they 
can act like waves and particles under certain circumstances. Heisenberg’s 
uncertainty principle and wave-particle duality contradict the principles of 
bivalence and extensionality according to some of the quantum logicians’ 
argumentation. It is argued that this is due to the impossibility of determin-
ing the truth value of a compound sentence about quantum mechanical 
phenomena from the truth values of its components and to the impossibil-
ity of assigning truth values to certain statements about quantum objects 
in general.
This problem will be addressed in the following. In chapter 1, the funda-
mentals of quantum mechanics and classical logic relevant to the discussion 
will be described. The failure of the distributive law is a main argument for 
the invalidity of classical logic when it comes to statements about quantum 
mechanical phenomena. It will be discussed in chapter 2. Arguments by 
John von Neumann and Garrett Birkhoff (1936) and Hilary Putnam (1968) 
and counter-arguments by Karl Popper (1968), Gerhard Schurz (2014), 
Michael Dummett (1976) and John Stachel (1986) will be reconstructed and 
discussed. As a conclusion it is found that by correct classical assignment of 

94
truth values to the statements in question and by interpreting the sentence 
connectives involved classically the distributive law does not fail to hold 
for the quantum mechanical phenomena discussed. Further it will be shown 
that classical logic cannot be defeated in case the underlying structure is 
no longer isomorphic to a Boolean algebra, because a comparison of the 
relevant properties of the structures is then no longer possible.
Chapter 3 is a closer examination of Hilary Putnam’s paper “Is logic 
empirical?” (1968). It comprises his invariance argument, according to 
which the meaning of the logical connectives does not change when the dis-
tributive law is omitted from classical logic, and his argument for bivalence 
in his quantum logical system, which he justifies with a certain interpre-
tation of statements about quantum objects. The counter-arguments by 
John Bell and Michael Hallett from their paper “Logic, Quantum Logic 
and Empiricism” (1982) will be reconstructed, leading to the conclusion 
that neither can invariance be claimed to hold for Putnam’s system nor is 
it compatible with bivalence.
The results are summarised and discussed in chapter 4. In a nutshell, this 
text comes to the conclusion that classical logic cannot be defeated by the 
findings of quantum mechanics as the discussed approaches propose, since 
they are based on a false or non-classical assignment of propositions or on a 
change of meaning of the logical connectives and therefore should not have 
been considered to be arguments against classical logic in the first place.
A fundamental assumption underlying the examination of the relation-
ship between classical logic and quantum mechanics is that logic can be 
empirically founded, or at least motivated. Otherwise, the question whether 
there is a need for a new logic to describe quantum mechanical phenomena 
would have to be negated right away. Since the presented approaches neces-
sarily make this assumption, it will not be questioned in this text.

1.  Fundamentals of Classical Logic and 
Quantum Mechanics
This chapter presents the logical and physical fundamentals for understand-
ing the following philosophical analysis of quantum logic. The phenomena 
of quantum mechanics in the approaches to quantum logic discussed in the 
chapters to come, namely wave-particle duality and Heisenberg’s uncer-
tainty principle, are illustrated by means of the double-slit experiment in 
section 1.1. The fundamental principles of classical logic are summarised 
in section 1.2 with focus on the principles of extensionality and bivalence, 
to which the quantum-logical approaches in this paper will be contrasted.
1.1  Peculiarities of Quantum Mechanics
Classical mechanics is a deterministic theory. This means that each property 
of a system has a specified value at each point in time, which makes future 
states of a system computable when the initial state is known13. Wave prop-
erties and particle properties are mutually exclusive in classical physics since 
particles are described as “localized bundles of energy and momentum”14 
and “[a] wave, in contrast, is a disturbance spread over space. It is described 
by a wave function 
(r,t) which characterizes the disturbance at the point 
r at time t.”15
These classical definitions cannot be applied to quantum mechanical 
objects since they show properties of particles and waves, which led to the 
assignment of a wave function  (x,t) to classical particles and waves, the 
squared absolute | (x,t)|
2 of which “gives the probability of finding it at a 
point x at time t”16. This property of quantum objects is called wave-particle

duality. It can be seen in the double-slit experiment in which single particles 
are registered on an observation screen after passing two slits (figure 1).
Figure 1:  Apparatus of the double-slit experiment.17
When the experiment is carried out with classical particles, like munition, 
the observation screen would show a pattern with maxima directly be-
hind the slits, see figure 2(a). Classical waves, e.g. water waves, would be 
fractured on the slits and new circular waves would spread from there, 
leading to an interference pattern on the observation screen as a result of 
constructive and destructive interference, see figure 2(b).18 The maxima 
(minima) are at those spots at which the distance of the observation screen 
to one of the slits is an integer of the wavelength (half of the wavelength) 
bigger or smaller than the distance from the observation screen to the other 
slit19. If the experiment is carried out with electrons as quantum objects, an 
interference pattern is detected on the observation screen (wave property)

Mechanics, Basic Books, 1–2.

97
while at the same time they are registered individually (particle property), 
see figure 2(c)20.
Figure 2:  Patterns observed in the double-slit experiments (a) with classical 
particles, (b) classical waves and (c) quantum objects.
Given that particles have a sharp position and electrons as quantum objects 
are not dividable it should be possible to determine through which of the 
two slits each single particle passes (the which-way information). But the 
pattern on the observation screen changes drastically as soon as a detector 
is placed behind the slits to determine the which-way information: there 
is no interference pattern anymore, but a pattern as is observed when car-
rying out the experiment with particles as displayed in figure 2(a). So it is 
not possible to know the way of the electron without changing the results 
of the experiment.21 This has been demonstrated for all quantum objects22.
Summing up, the following relevant phenomena can be seen from the 
experiment:
Wave-particle duality: Quantum objects show properties of waves and par-
ticles. In the double-slit experiment without detectors they are registered 
individually on the observation screen and build up an interference pattern 
as a wave characteristic.
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (HU): Determining precisely the posi-
tion x of a quantum object leads to a more imprecise determinability of 
its momentum p, which is described by the formula ∆

and other material particles do have a wavelength λ which is related to the 
momentum by the de-Broglie-relation λ = h/p23.) The formula means that  
the certainty of position (Δx) multiplied by the certainty of momentum 
(Δp) cannot be determined more precisely than the reduced Planck constant 
(ħ). In the experiment, this can be seen from the interference pattern being 
smeared out as soon as the way through the double-slit is determined using 
a detector24.
Moreover, it is impossible to determine the which-way information for 
one single electron beforehand. Only statistical predictions are possible with 
regard to the pattern detected on the observation screen and the behaviour 
of electrons.
1.2  Classical Logic
By classical logic we mean classical propositional logic. Here, as in many 
logical systems, formalisation is used to be able to make general statements 
about the truth and falsity of sentences and the validity of inferences and 
inference schemes. For this purpose, small letters p, q, r, … stand for propo-
sitions (like “It’s raining.”) and truth-functional operators (∨, ∧, →, ↔, ¬) 
stand for logical connectives (like the and-connection in “It’s raining and 
the street is wet.”). 
Formalisation enables us to study not only particular sentences and argu-
ments but the truth/falsity of sentence forms and the validity/invalidity of 
inference schemes. The definitions of logically true (L-true) sentences and 
logically valid (valid) inferences are:
Logically true: A sentence is logically true (for short: L-true) iff its (logical) sentence 
form is true for every possible interpretation of its non-logical symbols. We then 
also call this sentence form logically true.25
Logically valid: An inference is logically valid (for short: valid) iff for the logi-
cal form of this inference the following holds: every possible interpretation 
which makes all premises true, also makes the conclusion true. – Equivalently 
expressed: … iff there is no interpretation which makes all the premises true, but

99
the conclusion false. – If an inference is valid, then we say that its conclusion 
follows (logically) from its premises.26
The logical connectives have unique truth conditions which are summarised 
in table 1. For any connection of sentences with sentence connectives it is 
possible to decide whether it is true or false using truth conditions. The 
sentence “It’s not raining.” (¬ p) for example is true if and only if (iff) the 
sentence “It’s raining.” is false.

L-true (tautological) and L-false (contradictive) sentences (symbols:  resp. 
⊥) have a special status because they are true (resp. false) just because of 
their logical form: the former are true for each truth value assignment of 
the propositions they consist of, like p∨ ¬ p (Law of the Excluded Middle), 
the latter are false for each truth value assignment of their propositions, 
like p∧ ¬ p. Contingent sentences are sentences for which the truth value 
depends on the truth value of their components in the sense of varying with 
varying component truth values, the simplest example being p which is true 
if the sentence formalised as p is true and false if the underlying sentence is 
false. The truth values of the sentence connectives for each possible assign-
ment of truth values to the sentences p and q, as well as the terms L-true 
and L-false are illustrated in a truth table in table 2.

Classical logic is isomorphic to a Boolean algebra, which is defined as 
follows:
“A Boolean algebra is a system consisting of a set S and two operations,  and 
∩
 (cap and cup), subject to the following axioms. For all sets a, b, c, that are 
members of S:
1.	
a ∩ (b ∩ c) = (a ∩ b) ∩ c 
Also a 
∩
 (b

 c) = (a

There belong to S two elements, 0 and 1, with the properties
	
a

 0 = a; a ∩ 1 = a (identity)
5.	
For each set a in S there exists a set a′ with the properties that a

a ∩ a′ = 0. (complementation).”29 
Classical logic can be represented as a Boolean algebra by the assignments 
shown in table 3.

Sets of logically equivalent sentences (equivalence classes).
Two semantic principles are essential to classical logic (my own translation):
Principle of extensionality: “A sentence connective is truth-functional resp. 
extensional, if the truth value of its application is always and uniquely 
determined by the truth values of its arguments.”31
Principle of bivalence: “Any statement is either true or false (principle of 
bivalence).
This principle of bivalence can be split into two parts:
o	Any statement is either true or false, there is no ‘third’ truth value (Law 
of Excluded Middle, formalised: A or not-A).
o	No statement can be true and false at the same time (Law of Noncon-
tradiction, formalised: not(A and not-A).”32
The former (section 1.1) described impossibility of determining a quantum 
object’s position and momentum with a certain precision due to HU33 is 
in certain interpretations a defeater for the principle of extensionality. For 
example, the statements p and q can be true simultaneously, without their 
conjunction being true for small intervals [a, b] and [c, d]:

though.

102
p = “The particle’s position is in the interval [a, b].”
q = “The particle’s momentum is in the interval [c, d].”
According to the principle of extensionality, the truth value of a compound 
sentence can be determined from the truth value of its components and a 
conjunction is true iff both of its components are true, which is not auto-
matically the case here since the conjunction p ∧ q might violate HU.
A similar point can be made with regard to wave-particle duality. Ana-
lysed separately the statements r and s seem to have a different meaning 
than there disjunction has:
r = “The particle passes through the left slit.”
s = “The particle passes through the right slit.”
In case the which-way information is not determined and accordingly the 
disjunction r ∨ s is interpreted as if there was no detector in the double-slit 
experiment, r and s seem to be false when analysed separately, whereas 
their disjunction r ∨ s seems to be true. This contradicts classical logic 
because for a disjunction to be true at least one of its disjuncts has to be 
true. r resp. s can only be true in case the which-way information has been 
determined. Therefore, the statements and their disjunction are subject to 
different experimental setups in this interpretation.
These problems were addressed by John von Neumann and Garrett 
Birkhoff as well as Hilary Putnam and shall be discussed in the following.

103
2.  Quantum logic and the distributive law
An argument for the refusal or restriction of the validity of classical logic 
when it comes to quantum mechanics is that the distributive law
p ∧ (q ∨ r) ↔ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r)
is not valid for certain quantum mechanical statements. In table 4 it is 
demonstrated that it is valid in classical logic since the left and the right 
side of the argument have the same truth value for any truth value assigned 
to the propositions p, q, r – both sides are either true or false and therefore 
the truth condition of the biconditional connective is satisfied.

Two types of arguments for its failure in quantum mechanics are discussed 
in the following:
1)	Birkhoff and von Neumann construct a counter-example in which  
p ∧ (q ∨ r) is tautologically true, while the conjunctions (p ∧ q) and  
(p ∧ r) are false.
2)	Putnam proposes a logical structure in which the left and the right side 
of the distributive law have different meanings for mathematical reasons.

104
2.1  Birkhoff and von Neumann’s argument
In their paper “The Logic of Quantum Mechanics” (1936), Garrett Birkhoff 
and John von Neumann argue for the failure of the distributive law for 
quantum mechanical propositions. They introduce a set of propositions in 
which the left side and the right side are not equivalent:
“That it [the distributive law, AS] does break down is shown by the fact that if a 
denotes the experimental observation of a wave-packet 
 on one side of a plane 
in ordinary space, a′ correspondingly the observation of 
 on the other side, and  
b the observation of 
 in a state symmetric about the plane, then (as one can 
readily check): 
b ∩ (a 
∩
 a′) = b ∩ 1 = b > 0 = (b ∩ a) = (b ∩ a′) = (b ∩ a) 
∩
 (b ∩ a′)”34
In logical symbols their argument is represented as
b ∧ (a ∨ ¬a) ↔ b ∧ 
⊥
 ↔ b  
 ⊥ ↔ (b ∧ a) ↔ (b ∧ ¬a) ↔ (b ∧ a) ∨ (b ∧ ¬a).
The argument is based on the assumption that the observation of a particle 
 on the one and the other side of a plane at the same time is a tautology  
(a ∨ ¬a), while observing the one resp. the other side at the same time 
with a symmetric observation of the plane is regarded a contradiction  
(b ∧ a resp. b ∧ ¬a). The reason for this assumption can be considered to 
be wave-particle duality, due to which the possibility of determining the 
position (particle property) and at the same time observing the whole plane 
(which will without disturbance result in an interference pattern character-
istic for waves) is excluded.
To illustrate their argument more clearly, it shall be discussed applied to 
a double-slit experiment performed with one single electron. The set of the 
propositions a, ¬a and b is in this case

= “Detection of the electron at the left slit.”
¬a	
= “Detection of the electron at the right slit.”
b	
= “Observation of the double-slit without determining the which-
way information.”

and is illustrated in figure 3, where the path of the electron is indicated by 
an arrow.
Figure 3: Propositions in Birkhoff and von Neumann’s argument against the 
distributive law applied to the double-slit experiment (D=detector).35
The two possible paths that the electron can take through the double-slit 
are denoted by the propositions a and ¬a. In reality, the detection of the 
electron at one of the slits (left or right) will result in a particle pattern on 
the observation screen when enough electrons have been sent through the 
apparatus. Proposition b denotes the observation of the double-slit without 
detectors which would result in an interference pattern on the observation 
screen for a sufficient amount of electrons. It is indicated by several arrows 
that the which-way information is not available is proposition b is true. 
Loosely formalised, Birkhoff and von Neumann’s argument is:
Left side (from left to right): Observing the double-slit without which-way 
information AND (Detection of the electron at the left slit OR detection of 
the electron at the right slit) is equal to observing the double-slit without 
which-way information AND a tautology, which is equal to observing the 
double-slit without which-way information.
Right side (from right to left): (Observing the double-slit without which-way 
information AND detection of the electron at the left slit) OR (Observing 
the double-slit without which-way information AND detection of the

electron at the right slit) is equal to (Observing the double-slit without 
which-way information AND detection of the electron at the left slit), which 
is equal to (Observing the double-slit without which-way information AND 
detection of the electron at the right slit) and both are contradictions.
So it is assumed on the one hand that the detection of the electron at the 
left and the right slit at the same time (a ∨ ¬a) is a tautology, whereas the 
observation of the double-slit as a whole and the detection of the electron 
at one of the two slits at the same time is interpreted as a contradiction. In 
this example this is due to the interference pattern smearing out as soon as 
the which-way information is determined, which makes the truth of a sen-
tence like “The particle passes the left slit and acts like a wave.” impossible.
These assumptions can ad hoc be criticised as follows. As illustrated in 
figure 3, detection of the electron at the left or right slit is not the same as 
an observation without detection, since determination of the which-way 
information will always result in the electron behaving as a particle, which 
is indicated by one single arrow in propositions a and ¬a, whereas the 
experiment without detectors will result in the electron behaving like a 
wave which cannot be assigned a sharp position, indicated by many arrows 
in proposition b. Karl Popper’s criticism of this argument will be discussed 
in the following.
2.1.1  Popper’s criticism
Karl Popper criticises the set of propositions which Birkhoff and von Neu-
mann chose in their argument in that it would not be in accordance with 
classical logic which made their argument invalid:
“Nothing in this argument is specific to quantum mechanics: indeed, we may 
substitute an elephant in ‘ordinary observation space’ for the wave-packet. For if a 
denotes the experimental observation or position of anything, be it a wave-packet 
or an elephant (even a classical mass-point may be included, though it comes 
nearest to being dubious) on one side of a plane in ordinary observation space, 
then a′ (the complement of a which according to Birkhoff and von Neumann is 
the ordinary classical set-theoretic orthocomplement) does not ‘correspondingly’ 
denote its observation or position on the other side. a′ denotes, rather, the property 
‘not on the one side’. For wave-packets, elephants, or even classical mass-points, 
this is perfectly compatible with the property denoted earlier by b; that is to say 
with the property ‘symmetric about the plane’. It is also compatible with many 

107
other properties. Thus b = b ∧ a′ and b ≠ 0 = b ∧ a ≠ b ∧ a′ and so the thought 
experiment of Birkhoff and von Neumann breaks down.”36
Thus, according to Popper, if a denotes observation of the one side, ¬ a does 
not denote observation of the other side, but in accordance with the classical 
definition of the negation connective an observation made not on the one 
side, which is a proper subset of proposition b and thus b can be substi­
tuted for b ∧ ¬a. As a consequence, the truth values of b ∧ a and b ∧ ¬a 
are not identical, as Birkhoff and von Neumann argued, but distinct, the 
former as a contradiction being false in any case, the latter being contingent 
as b can be substituted for it and which is therefore true if b is true.
Applied to the example of the double-slit experiment introduced above 
to clarify Birkhoff and von Neumann’s argument, ¬a would no longer stand 
for the detection on the right side, but for
¬2a = “Observation with no detection at the left slit”.
Thus, in the following the negation used by Birkhoff and von Neumann 
will be denoted ¬1 and Popper’s negation ¬2. Loosely formalised Popper’s 
argument is then:
Left side (b ↔ b ∧ ¬2a): Observing the double-slit without which-way infor-
mation is equal to observing the double-slit without which-way information 
AND observation without detection at the left slit.
Right side (b 
 
 0 ↔ b ∧ a 
 
 b ∧ ¬2a): Observing the double-slit without 
which-way information is not equal to the contradiction “Observing the 
double-slit without which-way information AND detection of the electron 
at the left slit” which in turn is not equal to observing the double-slit 
without which-way information AND observation without detection at 
the left slit.
Popper’s argument seems to be more compatible with quantum mechan-
ics, especially with wave-particle duality, because it takes into account the 
fact that the experiment has different outcomes depending on whether or 
not a detector is integrated. This is why b ∧ a is a contradiction. Figure 4 
demonstrates the argument including the changes proposed by Popper.

The dashed arrow points to the part of the argument that Popper rejects: 
detecting the electron at the left slit and at the same time observing the 
double-slit without which-way information is a contradiction and there-
fore is not equal to the observation without detection at the left slit while 
observing without which-way information (which can be regarded identi-
cal, as argued). The continuous arrows point at the parts of the argument 
where Popper’s changes have to be applied: b ∧ a is equal to a contradiction 
and can be replaced therefore by ⊥ and b ∧ ¬2a can be replaced by b. As a 
result, the left side as well as the right side of the argument are equal to b, 
the observation of the double-slit without which-way information. Thus, 
on the grounds of the classical meaning of negation alone, Birkhoff and von 
Neumann’s argument is not valid according to Popper.
2.1.2  Schurz’s criticism
A slight variation of the argument was proposed:
“To illustrate why the distributive law fails, consider a particle moving on a line 
and let:
a = ‘the particle has momentum in the interval 
0, +    ’
b = ‘the particle is in the interval [–1, 1]’
c = ‘the particle is in the interval [–1, 3]’
1
6



109
We might observe that:
a ∧ (b ∨ c)= true
In other words, that the particle’s momentum is between 0 and +1/6, and its po-
sition is between –1 and +3. On the other hand, the propositions a ∧ b and a ∧ c  
are both false, since they assert tighter restrictions on simultaneous values of 
position and momentum than is allowed by the uncertainty principle in quantum 
mechanics. So: 
(a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c)= false
Thus the distributive law fails.”37
Just as in the argument proposed by Birkhoff and von Neumann, a set of 
propositions is proposed in which the right side of the distributive law is 
false due to the findings of quantum mechanics, here because of HU. On 
the right side of the argument, the position and momentum coordinates are 
determined with greater certainty than HU allows. On the left side of the 
argument, the disjunction of b and c is considered to be equivalent to the un-
ion of the intervals described by these propositions, [–1,1]  [1,3] = [–1,3],  
which is compatible with HU.
Gerhard Schurz38 criticises the set of propositions in this argument. 
According to quantum mechanics it is not possible to make a statement 
about a particle (e.g. an electron) being in a defined interval or having a 
defined momentum before measurement, but only about a measurement 
carried out on the particle to find out its position or momentum leading to 
a certain result. It is only possible to make statements about the result of a 
certain measurement of position or of momentum, and of the probability 
of this result. This is why in quantum mechanics statements about the posi-
tion or momentum of a particle before measurement are always statements 
about the possible results of a position or momentum measurement. Thus, 
in accordance with quantum mechanics, the predictions possible before 
measurement are rather:

b* = “The result of a measurement of the particle’s position will be in 
the interval [–1,1].”
c* = “The result of a measurement of the particle’s position will be in 
the interval [1,3].”
Measuring the particle’s position and its momentum at the same time is re-
stricted by HU. Therefore, the statements about the position of the particle, 
b* and c*, are false when the statement about the position, a*, is true. It is 
not possible to carry out the measurement corresponding to b* and c* as soon 
as the momentum has been specified. On the other hand, if either b* or c* is 
true, a prediction of the momentum as described by a* is no longer possible 
which thus leads to a* being false. Summing up: The propositions a* and 
b* and a* and c* describe mutually exclusive properties because of HU. In 
figure 5 it is illustrated that the distributive law holds for the aligned set of 
propositions proposed by Schurz – exemplarily for the case of a* being true 
making b* and c* false. Since the main sentence connectives on the left (∧) 
and on the right (∨) side of the argument are false, the biconditional is true.
Figure 5: Validity of the distributive law following the argumentation of Schurz, 
exemplarily for a* being true, b* and c* being false.
Both Popper’s and Schurz’s arguments account for quantum mechanics 
more accurately. Schurz’s argument reflects HU more accurate than the ori-
ginal argument because it accounts for the fact that simultaneous measure-
ment of position and momentum is in quantum mechanics restricted by HU.

2.2  Putnams’s argument
Hilary Putnam defines statements about quantum mechanical system as 
“statements of the form m(s) = r – ‘the magnitude m has the value r in the 
system s’”39. Each of these statements corresponds to a one-dimensional 
subspace in the vector space which describes the system in question math-
ematically and the subspaces corresponding to all possible values r n span the 
vector space (i. e. they define its dimension – meaning mathematically that 
they are mutually orthogonal and a set of basis vectors). Figure 6 illustrates 
this for the three-dimensional case, meaning that the considered magnitude 
has three possible values. The one-dimensional subspaces (vectors) S(p), 
S(q) and S(r) each correspond to a statement regarding the value of the 
magnitude in and span together the vector space H(s).
Figure 6: Three-dimensional example of the assignment of propositions S(p), S(q) 
and S(r) to vectors in the vector space H(s) describing the system.

Science 5, Dordrecht, Holland: Reidel, 216–41. Page numbers in the text are

(1979): Philosophical Papers Vol. 1: 174–197, 177. [Emphasis in original.] 

112
The sentence connectives are defined as follows in Putnam’s system:
“S(p ∨ q) = the span of the spaces S(p) and S(q), 	
(1)
S(p ∧ q) = the intersection of the spaces S(p) and S(q),	
(2)
S(¬p) = the orthocomplement of S(p). 	
(3)”40
In contrast to Boolean algebras the disjunction of two propositions does 
not correspond to the union of two sets but is defined as the span of the 
vectors of which it consists. Negation is defined as orthocomplement, but 
in space and not for sets. Figure 7 illustrates the mathematical meaning of 
Putnam’s sentence connectives exemplarily for the three-dimensional case.
Figure 7: Mathematical meaning of the sentence connectives as proposed by 
Putnam for the three-dimensional case.
In this system Putnam argues for the invalidity of the distributive law for 
quantum mechanical propositions as follows. Considering the properties 
position, S i, and momentum, T j, of a particle he states:
“[…] S1 ∨ S2 ∨ …∨ SR	
(1)
is a true state description in quantum logic and so is
T1 ∨ T2 ∨ … ∨ TR	
(2)
In words: 	Some Si is a true state description 	
(1')
and 	
Some Tj is a true state description. 	
(2')
[…] However […] the conjunction Si ∧ Tj is inconsistent for all i, j.” 41
40	 Ibid., 178. [Notation aligned to fit the rest of this text.]
41	 Ibid., 184–185. [Notation aligned to fit the rest of this text.]

113
Thus, he evaluates the disjunction over all possible position resp. momen-
tum coordinates to be true, while he evaluates the conjunction of two 
specific values, Si ∧ Tj , to be false for any possible pairing (for all i, j). As-
suming that position S has been specified by measurement and the possible 
momentum coordinates are T1 ∨ T2 ∨ … ∨ TR, he reasons
S ∧ (T1 ∨ T2 ∨ … ∨ TR) ↔ S.
 42
In words: The intersection of the position (S) and the whole vector space  
(T1 ∨ T2 ∨ … ∨ TR spans the vector space since this disjunction represents all 
possible values of the considered magnitude – see figure 8, left) is equal to 
the position.
On the other hand, he argues that
(S ∧ T1) ∨ (S ∧ T2) ∨ … ∨ (S ∧ TR) ↔ ⊥ ∨ ⊥ ∨ … ∨ ⊥ ↔ ⊥.
43
In words: The span of the intersection of the position and any possible 
momentum coordinate is equal to the origin of the vector space, which is 
identical to the empty set (see figure 8, right).
Figure 8: All possible values for T span the whole space H(s) (left). The 
intersection of the position S with any of the momentum coordinates  
is equal to the origin (right). Example for three-dimensional case. 
42	 Cf. Ibid., 179.
43	 Cf. Ibid., 179.

114
This is the reason for the failure of the distributive law in Putnam’s system; 
the left side of the argument (position, S) is not equal to the right side (the 
origin, ⊥). A formalization of the complete argument is
S ∧ (T1 ∧ T2  ∨ … ∨ TR ) ↔ S  
 ⊥ ↔ ⊥ ∨ ⊥ ∨ … ∨ ⊥ ↔ ( S ∧ T1) ∨ ( S ∧ T2) ∨ … ∨ ( S ∧ TR).
Putnam’s interpretation of the statements about position and momentum 
allows for statements of the form “The particle has a position and a mo-
mentum.” to be evaluated as true, since he evaluates the disjunction of all 
possible values for the momentum of the particle as true in case of a given 
position and interprets the sentence as meaning “The particle has sharp 
position S and any sharp momentum.”:
“At this point let us return to the question of ‘determinism’ for the last time. Sup-
pose I know a ‘logically strongest factual statement’ about S at t0, and I deduce a 
similar statement about S after time t has elapsed – say, S3. Then I measure mo-
mentum. Why can I not predict the outcome? We already said: ‘because S3 does 
not imply Tj for any j′. But a stronger statement is true: S3 is incompatible with Tj, 
for all j! But it does not follow that S3 is incompatible with (T1 ∧ T2  ∨ … ∨ TR).
Thus it is still true, even assuming S3, that ‘the particle has a momentum’; and 
if I measure I shall find it. However, S3 cannot tell me what I shall find, because 
whatever I find will be incompatible with S3 (which will no longer be true, when 
I find Tj). Quantum mechanics is more deterministic than indeterministic in that 
all inability to predict is due to ignorance.”44
Leaving open the specific momentum coordinate of the particle when know-
ing its position leads to a statement compatible with HU and at the same 
time the problem of assigning truth values to statements about a particle’s 
position and momentum seems to vanish as soon as the distributive law is 
not considered to hold for these statements.
2.2.1  Dummett’s criticism
In his article “Is logic empirical?” (1976), Michael Dummett shows that 
Putnam has to assume distributivity in his system because of the way he 
assigns meaning to disjunction:
“It is not Putnam’s opponents, but Putnam himself, who cannot, for very long 
at a time, ‘appreciate the logic employed in quantum mechanics’; it is Putnam, 
44	 Ibid., 186–187. [Emphasis in original.]

115
and not they, who ‘smuggles in’ distributivity. For Putnam’s whole argument, at 
this point, depends upon distributing truth over disjunction; upon assuming that, 
because the disjunction B1 ∨ … ∨ Bn is true, therefore some one of the disjuncts 
must be true. And, if we assume this, it becomes impossible to see how the law 
which distributes conjunction over disjunction can fail to hold, since, patently, 
truth distributes over conjunction on any view.”45 
Thus, Dummett’s criticism regards the inference from the truth of the dis-
junction of all momentum coordinates to the truth of one of the momentum 
coordinates. Since Putnam assumes this is valid, he makes the first assump-
tion of the distributive law – a disjunction is true if one of the disjuncts is 
true. This is also the reason why the disjuncts can be distributed. The other 
necessary assumption for the distributive law cannot be rejected easily – 
truth has to be distributive over conjunction, since the conjunction’s truth 
condition is that for the conjunction to be true both conjuncts have to be 
true. For the sake of his argument, thus, Putnam would have to reject the 
weaker assumption that truth distributes over disjunction. As he defined 
the disjunction as the span in space and not union of sets he could more 
easily argue for a different interpretation of its meaning or truth conditions. 
But this would in turn lead to his interpretation of the disjunction of all 
momentum coordinates to be invalid, namely the particle would not have 
any defined momentum. Thus, Dummett showed that the distributive law 
is necessarily needed for the interpretation Putnam derives from the failure 
of the distributive law.
2.2.2  Stachel’s criticism
John Stachel argues in his paper “Do Quanta Need a New Logic?” (1986) 
that Putnam cannot use the classical definitions of the sentence connectives 
in the system he proposes and that therefore the statements which Putnam 
derives from the failure of the distributive law do not follow from his sys-
tem. This was due to Putnam proving the statements with quantum-logical 
sentence connectives, while interpreting them using their classical definition:
45	 Dummett, M. (1976): “Is Logic Empirical?” in: Truth and Other Enigmas, 
Harvard University Press, 1978, 269–289, 273.

116
“This case is based, I think, on tacitly allowing the standard logical interpretation 
of the meaning of these propositions to hover about their discussion, while proving 
them by a strictly quantum-logical interpretation of their meaning.”46
Stachel shows that applying the quantum-logical interpretation Putnam 
uses when proving the failure of the distributive law to statements on a 
particle’s position and momentum leads to far weaker statements than 
those Putnam derives.
Stachel begins his argument citing Saul Kripke, who showed that it is 
impossible for the distributive law to fail when the classical interpretation of 
sentence connectives is applied. From this fact Stachel reasons that Putnam 
has to apply a non-classical interpretation in his argument47.
According to Stachel, Kripke argues as follows: 48
(1)	 He assumes that there are two magnitudes A, B and each can have the 
value 1 or 2.
(2)	 In analogy to Putnam he assumes that the statements in (a) are true 
while the statements in (b) are false – the disjunction of the two values 
that the magnitudes can have is true and the conjunction of one set 
value of each magnitude is false:
(a)	 True: A = 1 ∨ A = 2, B = 1 ∨ B = 2
(b)	 False: A = 1 ∧ B = 1, A = 1 ∧ B = 2, A = 2 ∧ B = 1, A = 2 ∧ B = 2
(3)	 Then he assumes A = 1. There are two possibilities for the value of B 
according to (1): B = 1 ∨ B = 2.
(3.1) He assumes B = 1. This leads to A = 1 ∧ B = 1 being true.
 contradiction to (2b)
(3.2) He assumes B = 2. This leads to A = 1 ∧ B = 2 being true.
 contradiction to (2b)
Thus, assuming two magnitudes with two values in the way Putnam does 
leads in any case to a contradiction when the sentence connectives are in-
terpreted classically. Stachel argues that this is why the distributive law is 
46	 Stachel, J. (1986): “Do Quanta Need a New Logic?” in: From Quarks to 
Quasars: Philosophical Problems of Modern Physics, R. G. Colodny, A. Coffa

117
valid in the classical case and if it is not valid in Putnam’s logical system, 
then Putnam could not use the classical meaning of the sentence connectives 
when interpreting the statements of his system.49 
In Putnam’s system the disjunction is defined as the span of the vectors 
to which the propositions are assigned and all propositions described 
in one basis, which correspond to all possible values of a magnitude, 
span the whole vector space assigned to the system in question. Stachel 
argues that because of this definition the disjunction of all possible mo-
mentum values 
1, 
2, …, 
n does in fact not mean that the system has  
any sharp momentum but rather that a Hilbert space is assigned to the 
system in question which corresponds to any tautology like the one that 
the system exists:
“Now, the quantum-logical interpretation of ‘∨’ is spanning of the subspaces 
involved, so 
1∨ 
2∨ … ∨ 
n is equivalent to the entire Hilbert space. How 
are we to translate this into a proposition? Presumably by ‘Oscar has a Hilbert 
space.’[…] Perhaps we may express this more colloquially by some other version 
of the trivially true proposition, such as ‘Oscar exists.’”50
Thus, Stachel shows that when rejecting the distributive law, Putnam cannot 
at the same time assume the classical meaning of the sentence connectives. 
This leads to the disjunction of all possible momentum values in conjunc-
tion with a sharp position (S ∧ (T1 ∨ T2 ∨ … ∨ TR)) meaning that the system 
has a defined position S and not that the system has any momentum and a 
position at the same time.
2.3  Conclusion on the distributive law
The arguments that reject the distributive law because of a counter-
argument with quantum mechanical propositions seem not to work. 
Birkhoff and von Neumann’s argument is not plausible because they do 
not interpret negation classically. Slightly altered, the argument still fails 
because the disjunction on the left side is assigned the truth value true,  
 
49	 Cf. Ibid., 305.
50	 Ibid., 303. “Oscar” refers to a single-particle system introduced by Putnam in 
his paper ‘How to think quantum-logically’ in an argument corresponding to 
the one reconstructed in section 2.2.

118
although both disjuncts are false due to HU if the propositions involved 
are reformulated, as proposed by Schurz, in stronger accordance with 
quantum mechanics.
Putnam’s argument is based on a different logical system and can there-
fore not be seen as directly criticising classical logic. According to Dum-
mett, Putnam has to apply the distributive law in order to assign true to 
the disjunction of all possible momentum coordinates. This is confirmed 
by Stachel who argued that a classical interpretation of the sentence con-
nectives is not possible in Putnam’s system because his argument is based 
on a quantum-logical interpretation. The problem of the meaning of the 
sentence connectives in Putnam’s system will be examined in section 3.1.

119
3.  Meaning and bivalence in Putnam’s 
quantum logical system
Putnam not only argues for the need of a new logic for quantum mechanical 
statements but even for refusing classical logic in favour of quantum logic 
which he claims to be the true logic of the world:
“We must now ask: what is the nature of the world if the proposed interpretation of 
quantum mechanics is the correct one? The answer is both radical and simple. Logic 
is as empirical as geometry. […] We live in a world with a non-classical logic.”51
He argues that just like Euclidian geometry which had to be replaced by 
general relativity because of its higher empirical accuracy, classical logic 
might approximate reality but is not universally applicable. This is empha-
sized by the following relation:
 
GEOMETRY
GENERAL RELATIVITY
LOGIC
QUANTUM MECHANICS
=
52
His main reason for proposing a change in logic seems to be the wish for a 
more accurate treatment of the – from the classical standpoint at first glance 
paradox – results of quantum mechanics. Putnam argues that the classical 
standpoint brings about inexplicable phenomena:
“Now then, the situation in quantum mechanics may be expressed thus: we could 
keep classical logic, but at a very high price. Just as we have to postulate mysterious 
'universal forces' if we are to keep Euclidean geometry 'come what may', so we 
have to postulate equally mysterious and really very similar agencies – e.g. in their 
indetectability, their violation of all natural causal rules, their ad hoc character – if 
we are to reconcile quantum mechanics with classical logic via either the 'quantum 
potentials' of the hidden variable theorists, or the metaphysics of Bohr.”53
John Bell and Michael Hallett describe Putnam’s motivation as follows: 
he is trying to save realism – a move which is required because the classi-
cal metaphysical theory (MC) is not in accordance with the empirical data 
when classical physics (C) is replaced by quantum physics (Q). So Putnam

120
tries to get from Q + MQ + LC to Q + MC + LQ (quantum physics with 
quantum metaphysics and classical logic to quantum physics with classical 
metaphysics and quantum logic), because changing logic seems to him to 
be less severe than giving up realism because of a counterintuitive quantum 
mechanical metaphysics (e. g. with hidden variables).54
Putnam’s refusal of the distributive law raises questions. Which meaning 
can be assigned to the sentence connectives if the law is not valid? Putnam 
argues that the meaning of the sentence connectives stays the same as in 
classical logic, because all other classical properties of the connectives are 
valid in quantum logic as well. This argument is called “invariance of mean-
ing argument” by Bell and Hallett and will be discussed together with their 
criticism in section 3.1.
Another question is whether or not the principle of bivalence is in ac-
cordance with Putnam’s system and will be discussed in section 3.2. Putnam 
argues in the affirmative: as discussed above, statements about the position 
and momentum of a particle can be made in his interpretation of his system 
which would imply bivalence for quantum mechanical propositions. Bell 
and Hallett show that bivalence is not possible in his system because of the 
Kochen-Specker theorem: there is no unique mapping from Putnam’s system 
to the set of truth values which would be needed to ensure that a truth value 
is assigned to at least one statement the system contains.
3.1  Invariance of meaning
Putnam argues that the distributive law (10) is not valid in quantum logic 
but for the sentence connectives to keep their classical meaning it was suf-
ficient that the properties (1) – (9) hold:
“The following principles:
p implies p ∨ q	
(1)
q implies p ∨ q	
(2)
if p implies r and q implies r then p ∨ q implies r	
(3)
all hold in quantum logic, and these seem to be like the basic properties of ‘or’. 
Similarly
p, q together imply p ∨ q	
(4)
54	 Cf. Bell, J., Hallett, M. (1982): “Logic, Quantum Logic and Empiricism”, Phi-
losophy of Science 49 (3), 355–379, 356. 

121
(Moreover, p ∨ q is the unique proposition that is implied by every proposition 
that implies both p and q.)
p ∧ q implies p	
(5)
p ∧ q implies q	
(6)
All hold in quantum logic. And for negation we have that p and ¬ p never both 
hold p ∧ ¬ q is a contradiction) 	
(7)
(p ∧ ¬ q) holds 	
(8)
¬¬ p is equivalent to p	
(9)
[…]  
p ∧ (q ∨ r)is equivalent to p ∧ q ∨ p ∧ r (which fails in quantum logic) 	
(10)
Only if it can be made out that (10) is ‘part of the meaning’ of ‘or’ and/or ‘and’ 
(which and how does one decide?) can it be maintained that quantum mechanics 
involves a ‘change of meaning’ of one or both of the connectives.”55
Thus, Putnam considers the classical interpretation of the sentence connec-
tives to be valid in quantum logic as long as it cannot be shown that the 
distributive law contributes to their meaning.
In his paper “Some conceptual problems of quantum theory” (1972), 
Arthur Fine (cited according to Bell and Hallett) points to the fact that a 
change of meaning occurs in Putnam’s system just because the connectives 
are introduced as operations in spaces:
“It has been justly observed by Fine (1972) that this fact already reveals a difference 
in meaning between the quantum-logical and classical connectives, because in the 
quantum case we are concerned with a lattice of subspaces while in the classical 
case we are concerned with a lattice of subsets, and the operations correspond-
ing to negation and disjunction are manifestly different in the two cases […].”.56
Thus, Putnam already introduces a change of meaning of the sentence con-
nectives when choosing a structure different from a Boolean algebra, and in 
this case, Fine’s argument is sufficient to show the failure of the invariance 
of meaning argument – the distributive law has not even to be considered 
as the change from sets to spaces already changes the meaning of disjunc-
tion and negation. 
55	 Putnam (1968), 189–190.

levant here: 16–19), cited as in Bell, Hallett (1982), 362. [Emphasis in original.]

122
But Bell and Hallett make an even stronger case for the failure of the in-
variance of meaning argument. They analyse ortholattices which have been 
proposed as an underlying structure for quantum logic instead of Hilbert 
space and in fact do have the same core axioms as Boolean algebras. This 
is why it could be possible to define both classical and quantum connec-
tives in terms of those core axioms and in this case Fine’s argument could 
no longer be applied and quantum logic could be considered to be a more 
general logic as Putnam argued.
Lattices are in general algebraic structures in which the laws of associa-
tivity, commutativity and adsorption are valid and Boolean algebras are 
distributive lattices57. Ortholattices are defined as follows: “An ortholattice 
is a complemented bounded lattice (not necessarily distributive) satisfying 
the De Morgan laws and the law of double negation.”58. Just like Boolean 
algebras they are bounded (i.e. they have a smallest element 0 and a biggest 
element 1) and complemented. Further, the following theorems are valid 
in both structures:
“(DN)	
A ↔ ¬¬A	
Double negation
(DM∧)	
¬(A ∧ B) ↔ (¬A ∨ ¬B)	
DeMorgan-law 1
(DM∨)	
¬(A ∨ B) ↔ (¬A ∧ ¬B)	
DeMorgan-law 2”59
Since Boolean algebras have all the properties that ortholattices have, all 
Boolean algebras are ortholattices, but not the other way round (in other 
words: Boolean algebras are a subset of ortholattices). Thus, ortholattices 
are more general structures and if quantum-logical connectives could be 
defined in ortholattices equivalently to the classical connectives, then clas-
sical logic would be a (distributive) subset of quantum logic and Putnam’s 
analogy would be valid. 60
Bell and Hallett show in their paper “Logic, Quantum Logic and Em-
piricism” (1982) that the meaning of negation changes in any case if the 
connectives are defined in an ortholattice instead of Boolean algebras. Thus,

buch der Mathematik (6. Auflage), Deutsch, Frankfurt am Main, 355.

bras, World Scientific, 81.

123
it is not a slight change of meaning to define the connectives in a non-
distributive structure:
“We argue here that the invariance of meaning claim is false. Indeed, we show that 
the meaning of the negation operation in (abstract) quantum logic is quite different 
from the meaning of classical negation. This is sufficient to destroy the 'marginal 
change' contention, and thus the suggestion that quantum logic is automatically 
a satisfactory replacement for classical logic.”61
They formally argue as follows: a change of meaning of a term t occurs if t can 
be defined with regard to entities a, b, … in one structure L but not in another 
structure L′ which contains the same entities a, b, …62. The structure of the 
argument is shown in figure 9 (1). Applied to the quantum-logical case, their 
argument is as follows: while all connectives can be defined using the order 
relation ≤ in Boolean algebras, this cannot be done in ortholattices where 
another relation is needed, “most naturally”63 the orthogonality relation ⊥ 
(see figure 9 (2)). This fact will be examined more closely in the following.

logic (2). (BA=Boolean algebra, OL=ortholattice).
61	 Ibid., 362.
62	 Cf. Ibid., 363.
63	 Ibid., 365.

124
Following Bell and Hallett, the sentence connectives can be defined with 
the order relation as follows:64
•	 Conjunction: a ∧ b = c ↔ {x : x ≤ c} = {x : x ≤ a} ∩ {x : x ≤ b}
•	 Disjunction: a ∨ b = c ↔ {x : c ≤ x} = {x : a ≤ x} ∩ {x : b ≤ x}
•	 Negation: a = b′ ↔ {x : x ≤ a} = {x : b ∧ x = 0}
In words if the order relation is interpreted as implication: the conjunction 
of a and b is true for all x which imply both a and b.The disjunction of a 
and b is true for all x which are implied by a and b. a is the negation of 
b for all x which imply a resp. which are false in conjunction with b. It is 
exactly the latter definition which cannot be applied in non-distributive 
ortholattices and according to Bell and Hallett the most natural definition 
here would use the orthogonality relation:
a = b′ ↔ {x : x ≤ a} = {x : x ⊥ b}.65
In words: a is the negation of b (b′) for all x which imply a resp. which are 
orthogonal to b.
This is why according to Bell and Hallet’s definition the meaning of nega-
tion changes if it is defined in ortholattices. Thus, the same entity (negation) 
has different definitions in different structures which leads to their rejection 
of Putnam’s invariance of meaning claim: 
“We may conclude from this that Putnam’s invariance thesis fails even in this 
abstract setting, for the apparently minor ‘failure of distributivity’ of quantum 
logic is inextricably bound up with a shift in the meaning of negation. The fact 
that quantum negation satisfies the rules (8) and (9) mentioned by Putnam does 
not prevent its meaning from differing from that of its classical counterpart.”66
3.2  Bivalence
Putnam’s paper is based on the metaphysical assumption of value definite-
ness which means that the exact values of a particle’s momentum and 
position do exist and just cannot be known both at the same time. This 
is why he considers quantum mechanics to be rather deterministic than 
64	 Ibid., 364–365.
65	 Ibid., 365.
66	 Ibid., 366.

125
indeterministic – he regards the impossibility of predicting both the momen-
tum and the position coordinate’s value as grounded in the impossibility 
to know them which is why, he argues, the state descriptions in quantum 
mechanics cannot answer all physically important questions, but they are 
still complete. As discussed above a particle has a sharp position and mo-
mentum at each point in time according to Putnam.
If the magnitudes of a quantum mechanical system are considered to 
have sharp values at each time which just cannot be known all at once, then 
statements about them would have a defined truth value which is why the 
principle of bivalence could be applied to statements about those properties.
Bell and Hallett argue against this assumption using the Kochen-Specker-
theorem as proof which states that in the lattice of subspaces of three-
dimensional Euclidian space there are no weak homomorphisms67. In order 
to apply this theorem to Putnam’s case, they first introduce the assumptions 
(*) and (**) which are valid in Boolean algebras and to keep bivalence they 
have to be valid in quantum logic as well:
“(*) for any distinct elements a, b of a Boolean algebra B there is a 2-valued ho-
momorphism h on B such that h(a) ≠ h(b).
Here a 2-valued homomorphism is a homomorphism to the Boolean algebra 
2 = {0, 1}, which, of course, can be construed as the truth value algebra, {T, F}.  
The statement (*) implies (and indeed, for Boolean algebras, is equivalent to)
(**) for any Boolean algebra B and any element a ≠ 0 in B, there is a 2-valued 
homomorphism h such that h(a) = 1.”68
Thus, for the principle of bivalence to be valid there has to be a unique map-
ping between two algebraic structures which keeps the structure unchanged 
(homomorphism)69, more specifically between the set of propositions a, b, …  
and the set of truth values {0, 1} (see figure 10) and if a proposition a is not 
false (a ≠ 0), h has to assign the truth value true to it (h(a) = 1).

Figure 10: Demonstration of the homomorphism between Boolean algebras 
containing the elements a and b and the Boolean algebra 2 = {0,1}.
But, they continue, ortholattices fail to comply with (**). This is for 
quantum logic due to the existence of incompatible propositions, which 
are those that are true when considered separately but false if they are 
connected with the conjunction connective70 (e.g. statements about spe-
cific position and momentum coordinates at the same time – (S ∧ Ti).  
Truth values can only be assigned to the Boolean subalgebras which do 
not contain incompatible propositions, ”but bivalence about the world 
concerns simultaneous assignment of truth values”71, i.e. the principle of 
bivalence could only hold if the mapping h was valid for all statements made 
in quantum logic and would be in accordance to classical-logical laws for 
compatible propositions. The assignment of propositions to the lattice of 
closed subspaces of Hilbert space is done according to table 5:
Table 5: Assignment of quantum mechanical statements to the lattice of closed 
subspaces of Hilbert space72
Types of quantum mechanical 
propositions
Corresponding elements in the lattice of 
closed subspaces Lω of Hilbert space
Compatible propositions
Boolean subalgebras of Lω
Atomic propositions like “The value 
of the magnitude is such-and-such.”
Lines in Lω 
A truth value must be assigned to both types of quantum mechanical propo-
sitions to keep bivalence and this assignment must be in accordance with 
classical-logical laws for the compatible propositions:
“[…] given an orthocomplemented lattice L, is there a map h (representing, if 
you like, a simultaneous valuation) which is a weak homomorphism of L to 2, 
70	 Cf. Bell, Hallett (1982), 368.
71	 Ibid., 368.
72	 Ibid., 369.

127
that is to say, such that the restriction of h to any Boolean subalgebra of L is a 
homomorphism? The celebrated results of Kochen and Specker (1967) show, in 
effect, that for the relevant quantum lattices there can be no such map.”73
This assumption is illustrated in figure 11: the incompatible propositions do 
not form a Boolean subalgebra – as the compatible propositions do – but 
are represented by lines in space. For a weak homomorphism, a homomor-
phism from the Boolean algebra of compatible propositions to the Boolean 
algebra (the special Boolean algebra which only contains the elements 0 
and 1) would be sufficient, but Kochen and Specker showed that weak 
homomorphisms do not exist in 3-dimensional Euclidian space.
Figure 11: The mapping h which is needed to keep bivalence in quantum logic 
does not exist in ortholattices. 
This is why it is not possible to talk about the truth or falsity of any 
proposition in ortholattices. Thus, the principle of bivalence is not valid 
in ortholattices and therefore cannot hold in Putnam’s system even if his 
structure is changed to the more abstract one.

4.  Conclusion
The question whether or not logic can be empirically founded or motivated 
cannot be answered with the arguments discussed in this text. However, 
assuming that empirical data can defeat logical truths, this text points to 
the following results.
The counter-arguments for the distributive law are not convincing. Birk-
hoff and von Neumann simply do not use the classical meaning of nega-
tion in their set of propositions which makes their argument no defeater 
for classical logic. The distributive law was shown to be valid when the 
propositions were corrected in accordance with classical logic, as Popper 
proposed. Schurz showed that the assignment of propositions is wrong in 
the slightly altered form of the argument. Again, the distributive law was 
shown to be valid if the propositions were corrected. This means for the 
cases considered here that the distributive law is valid for quantum me-
chanical propositions if they are formulated in accordance with quantum 
mechanics and if the sentence connectives are interpreted in accordance 
with classical logic. The counter-arguments even show a higher accuracy 
in describing wave-particle duality and HU.
The quantum-logical system proposed by Putnam is not convincing as 
a replacement for classical logic as well. The distributive law is not valid 
in the system he proposes but his interpretation based on its failure is not 
possible. Dummett and Stachel showed that a non-classical interpretation 
of the sentence connectives is used to show the failure of the distributive 
law, while he interprets the result based on the distributive law resp. their 
classical interpretation. Therefore the statements he derives – especially on 
value definiteness – do not follow from his system. He either has to assume 
distributivity or change his interpretation. His invariance of meaning claim 
fails, as the proposed system is not isomorphic to Boolean algebras which 
leads to the definition of the negation being changed in any case (Hilbert 
space or ortholattice), as Bell and Hallett showed. Bivalence cannot hold in 
Putnam’s system, since no weak homomorphisms exist in three-dimensional 
Euclidian space (Kochen-Specker-theorem). Those would be needed for a 

130
mapping from Boolean subalgebras in the ortholattice of all propositions 
to the truth values.
All in all, the discussed arguments for refusing classical logic when deal-
ing with quantum phenomena are not plausible, as they do not reflect 
classical logic accurately and give no accurate account of the quantum 
mechanical phenomena they discuss. Putnam’s quantum logic cannot be 
regarded a more general logic (which he takes it to be), since the meaning 
of the sentence connectives he introduces is not clear and the principle of 
bivalence is not compatible with his approach. The counter-arguments lead 
to the assumption that classical logic is suitable for dealing with proposi-
tions about quantum objects.

Joint Conclusion 
(by Jan Philipp Dapprich and Annika Schuster)
One of the central themes in this book can be summarized as follows: Is 
quantum mechanics compatible with both ‘classical logic’ and ‘classical 
ontology’? A negative answer to this question would force us to choose 
between classical logic and classical ontology. Putnam argues that in the 
light of quantum mechanics classical logic is wrong and has to be replaced 
by a quantum logic. He wishes to save realism, including value definiteness. 
According to him, this would save us from inacceptable ontological impli-
cations which quantum mechanics when applied to classical logic would 
lead to, namely that it is incompatible with realism and value definiteness. 
Annika Schuster showed in the second part of the book that on the one 
hand Putnam’s quantum logic can itself not fulfil these needs (since the 
meaning of the connectives in his system is not clear and his system is not 
compatible with bivalence) and secondly that classical logic is not neces-
sarily incompatible with quantum mechanical propositions as long as these 
are formulated respecting the value indefiniteness of quantum mechanics.
Whether logic can be empirically motivated is not decidable from the 
arguments discussed. But it is possible to state that even if it was in fact 
empirical, the discussed arguments are unsuccessful in establishing an in-
compatibility between the empirical phenomena and classical logic.
Does this mean we have to reject realism? In the first part of this book 
Philipp Dapprich argued that we indeed have to choose between classi-
cal logic and value definiteness. However, a rejection of value definiteness 
doesn’t imply a rejection of realism altogether. Even if some observables 
only have values when measured, other quantities, such as the wave state, 
may well be interpreted in a realist fashion. 
Quantum mechanics is revolutionary in many ways. Besides making 
value definiteness impossible, it also precludes the possibility of determinis-
tic prediction. But claims that it is in conflict with core aspects of standard 
scientific methodology are exaggerated. It is not the method of science that 
needs to be revised, but rather our understanding of quantum mechanics.

134
We were unable to decide conclusively whether or not such a revision 
of our understanding should include a revision of the very fundamentals 
of quantum mechanics, as Penrose suggests. The least we can say is that, 
in the light of the problems arising when attempting to combine quantum 
mechanics with general relativity, the choice of an interpretation of quan-
tum mechanics may well be relevant. Choice of interpretation can, however, 
not solely be based on our ontological background, as most interpretations 
are compatible with a wide range of ontological positions.
