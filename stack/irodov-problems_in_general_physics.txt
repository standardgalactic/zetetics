PREFACE 
This book of problems is intended as a textbook for students at 
higher educational institutions studying advanced course in physics. 
Besides, because of the great number of simple problems it may be used 
by students studying a general course in physics. 
The book contains about 1900 problems with hints for solving the 
most complicated ones. 
For students' convenience each chapter opens with a time-saving 
summary of the principal formulas for the relevant area of physics. As a 
rule the formulas are given without detailed explanations since a stu-
dent, starting solving a problem, is assumed to know the meaning of the 
quantities appearing in the formulas. Explanatory notes are only given 
in those cases when misunderstanding may arise. 
All the formulas in the text and answers are in SI system, except in 
Part Six, where the Gaussian system is used. Quantitative data and 
answers are presented in accordance with the rules of approximation and 
numerical accuracy. 
The main physical constants and tables are summarised at the end of 
the book. 
The Periodic System of Elements is printed at the front end sheet 
and the Table of Elementary Particles at the back sheet of the book. 
In the present edition, some misprints are corrected, and a number 
of problems are substituted by new ones, or the quantitative data in 
them are changed or refined (1.273, 1.361, 2.189, 3.249, 3.97, 4.194 and 
5.78). 
In conclusion, the author wants to express his deep gratitude to col-
leagues from MIPhI and to readers who sent their remarks on some prob-
lems , helping thereby to improve the book.

A FEW HINTS FOR SOLVING 
THE PROBLEMS 
1. First of all, look through the tables in the Appendix, for many 
problems cannot be solved without them. Besides, the reference data 
quoted in the tables will make your work easier and save your time. 
2. Begin the problem by recognizing its meaning and its formula-
tion. Make sure that the data given are sufficient for solving the 
problem. Missing data can be found in the tables in the Appendix. 
Wherever possible, draw a diagram elucidating the essence of the 
problem; in many cases this simplifies both the search for a solution 
and the solution itself. 
3. Solve each problem, as a rule, in the general form, that is in 
a letter notation, so that the quantity sought will be expressed in 
the same terms as the given data. A solution in the general form is 
particularly valuable since it makes clear the relationship between 
the sought quantity and the given data. What is more, an answer ob-
tained in the general form allows one to make a fairly accurate judge-
ment on the correctness of the solution itself (see the next item). 
4. Having obtained the solution in the general form, check to see 
if it has the right dimensions. The wrong dimensions are an obvious 
indication of a wrong solution. If possible, investigate the behaviour 
of the solution in some extreme special cases. For example, whatever 
the form of the expression for the gravitational force between two 
extended bodies, it must turn into the well-known law of gravitational 
interaction of mass points as the distance between the bodies increases. 
Otherwise, it can be immediately inferred that the solution is wrong. 
5. When starting calculations, remember that the numerical values 
of physical quantities are always known only approximately. There-
fore, in calculations you should employ the rules for operating with 
approximate numbers. In particular, in presenting the quantitative 
data and answers strict attention should be paid to the rules of 
approximation and numerical accuracy. 
6. Having obtained the numerical answer, evaluate its plausibil 
ity. In some cases such an evaluation may disclose an error in the 
result obtained. For example, a stone cannot be thrown by a man 
over the distance of the order of 1 km, the velocity of a body cannot 
surpass that of light in a vacuum, etc. 

NOTATION 
Vectors are written in boldface upright type, e.g., r, F; the same 
letters printed in lightface italic type (r, F) denote the modulus of 
a vector. 
Unit vectors 
j, k are the unit vectors of the Cartesian coordinates x, y, z (some- 
times the unit vectors are denoted as ex, ey, e z), 
ep, eq), e z  are the unit vectors of the cylindrical coordinates p, p, z, 
n, i are the unit vectors of a normal and a tangent. 
Mean values are taken in angle brackets ( ), e.g., (v), (P). 
Symbols A, d, and 6 in front of quantities denote: 
A, the finite increment of a quantity, e.g. Ar = r2  — r1; AU = 
U 2 - U1, 
d, the differential (infinitesimal increment), e.g. dr, dU, 
8, the elementary value of a quantity, e.g. 6A, the elementary work. 
Time derivative of an arbitrary function f is denoted by dfldt, 
or by a dot over a letter, f. 
Vector operator V ("nabla"). It is used to denote the following 
operations: 
Vy, the gradient of q) (grad (p). 
V •E, the divergence of E (div E), 
V X E, the curl of E (curl E). 
Integrals of any multiplicity are denoted by a single sign S and 
differ only by the integration element: dV, a volume element, dS, 
a surface element, and dr, a line element. The sign denotes an 
integral over a closed surface, or around a closed loop.

where Ar is the displacement vector (an increment of a radius vector). 
• Velocity and acceleration of a point:

(1.1b) 
v—  dt ' w  = dt 
• Acceleration of a point expressed in projections on the tangent and the 
normal to a trajectory:

(1.1c) 
dt ' 
w n 	
R ' 
where R is the radius of curvature of the trajectory at the given point. 
• Distance covered by a point: 
s = 	
v dt, 	
(1.1d) 
where v is the modulus of the velocity vector of a point. 
• Angular velocity and angular acceleration of a solid body: 
dtp

(1.1e) 
• Relation between linear and angular quantities for a rotating solid 
body: 
v = [ow], wn  = o)2R, I w, I 	
(1.1.f) 
where r is the radius vector of the considered point relative to an arbitrary point 
on the rotation axis, and R is the distance from the rotation axis. 
1.1. A motorboat going downstream overcame a raft at a point A; 
T = 60 min later it turned back and after some time passed the raft 
at a distance 1 = 6.0 km from the point A. Find the flow velocity 
assuming the duty of the engine to be constant. 
1.2. A point traversed half the distance with a velocity v0. The 
remaining part of the distance was covered with velocity vl  for half 
the time, and with velocity v2  for the other half of the time. Find 
the mean velocity of the point averaged over the whole time of mo-
tion. 

1.3. A car starts moving rectilinearly, first with acceleration w = 
5.0 m/s2  (the initial velocity is equal to zero), then uniformly, and 
finally, decelerating at the same rate w, comes to a stop. The total 
time of motion equals t = 25 s. The average velocity during that 
time is equal to (v) = 72 km per hour. How long does the car move 
uniformly? 
1.4. A point moves rectilinearly in one direction. Fig. 1.1 shows 
s,m

the distance s traversed by the point as a function of the time t. 
Using the plot find: 
(a) the average velocity of the point during the time of motion; 
(b) the maximum velocity; 
(c) the time moment to  at which the instantaneous velocity is 
equal to the mean velocity averaged over the first to  seconds. 
1.5. Two particles, 1 and 2, move with constant velocities v1  and 
v2. At the initial moment their radius vectors are equal to r1  and r2. 
How must these four vectors be interrelated for the particles to col-
lide? 
1.6. A ship moves along the equator to the east with velocity 
vo  = 30 km/hour. The southeastern wind blows at an angle cp = 60° 
to the equator with velocity v = 15 km/hour. Find the wind velocity 
v' relative to the ship and the angle p' between the equator and the 
wind direction in the reference frame fixed to the ship. 
1.7. Two swimmers leave point A on one bank of the river to reach 
point B lying right across on the other bank. One of them crosses 
the river along the straight line AB while the other swims at right 
angles to the stream and then walks the distance that he has been 
carried away by the stream to get to point B. What was the velocity u 
12 

of his walking if both swimmers reached the destination simulta-
neously? The stream velocity v, = 2.0 km/hour and the velocity if 
of each swimmer with respect to water equals 2.5 km per hour. 
1.8. Two boats, A and B, move away from a buoy anchored at the 
middle of a river along the mutually perpendicular straight lines: 
the boat A along the river, and the boat B across thg river. Having 
moved off an equal distance from the buoy the boats returned. 
Find the ratio of times of motion of boats TA/TB  if the velocity of 
each boat with respect to water is i1 = 1.2 times greater than the 
stream velocity. 
1.9. A boat moves relative to water with a velocity which is n 
= 2.0 times less than the river flow velocity. At what angle to the 
stream direction must the boat move to minimize drifting? 
1.10. Two bodies were thrown simultaneously from the same point: 
one, straight up, and the other, at an angle of 0 = 60° to the hori-
zontal. The initial velocity of each body is equal to vo  = 25 m/s. 
Neglecting the air drag, find the distance between the bodies t = 
= 1.70 s later. 
1.11. Two particles move in a uniform gravitational field with an 
acceleration g. At the initial moment the particles were located at 
one point and moved with velocities v1  = 3.0 m/s and v2  = 4.0 m/s 
horizontally in opposite directions. Find the distance between the 
particles at the moment when their velocity vectors become mutu-
ally perpendicular. 
1.12. Three points are located at the vertices of an equilateral 
triangle whose side equals a. They all start moving simultaneously 
with velocity v constant in modulus, with the first point heading 
continually for the second, the second for the third, and the third 
for the first. How soon will the points converge? 
1.13. Point A moves uniformly with velocity v so that the vector v 
is continually "aimed" at point B which in its turn moves recti-
linearly and uniformly with velocity u< v. At the initial moment of 
time v J 
 u and the points are separated by a distance 1. How soon 
will the points converge? 
1.14. A train of length 1 = 350 m starts moving rectilinearly with 
constant acceleration w = 3.0.10-2  m/s2; t = 30 s after the start 
the locomotive headlight is switched on (event 1) , and t = 60 s 
after that event the tail signal light is switched on (event 2) . Find the 
distance between these events in the reference frames fixed to the 
train and to the Earth. How and at what constant velocity V rela-
tive to the Earth must a certain reference frame K move for the two 
events to occur in it at the same point? 
1.15. An elevator car whose floor-to-ceiling distance is equal to 
2.7 m starts ascending with constant acceleration 1.2 m/s2; 2.0 s 
after the start a bolt begins falling from the ceiling of the car. Find: 
(a) the bolt's free fall time; 
(b) the displacement and the distance covered by the bolt during 
the free fall in the reference frame fixed to the elevator shaft.

1.16. Two particles, 1 and 2, move with constant velocities vi 
and v2  along two mutually perpendicular straight lines toward the 
intersection point 0. At the moment t = 0 the particles were located 
at the distances 11  and 12  from the point 0. How soon will the distance 
between the particles become the smallest? What is it equal to? 
1.17. From point A located on a highway (Fig. 1.2) one has to get 
by car as soon as possible to point B located in the field at a distance 1 
from the highway. It is known that the car moves in the field ri 
times slower than on the highway. At what distance from point D 
one must turn off the highway? 
1.18. A point travels along the x axis with a velocity whose pro-
jection vx  is presented as a function of time by the plot in Fig. 1.3.

of the given ellipse, i.e. (r R)12, since in accordance with Kepler's 
laws the period of revolution is the same. 
1.203. Falling of the body on the Sun can be considered as the 
motion along a very elongated (in the limit, degenerated) ellipse 
whose major semi-axis is practically equal to the radius R of the 
Earth's orbit. Then from Kepler's laws, (2T/T)2  = [(R12)1R13, 
where i is the falling time (the time needed to complete half a revo-
lution along the elongated ellipse), T is the period of the Earth's 
revolution around the Sun. Hence, T = T/4112 = 65 days.

1.211. (a) First let us consider a thin spherical layer of radius p 
and mass SM. The energy of interaction of the particle with an ele-
mentary belt SS of that layer is equal to (Fig. 8) 
dU = —y (m8M/2/) sin 0 dO. 
According to the cosine theorem in the triangle OAP 12  = p2  
r2  — 2pr cos 0. Having determined the differential of this expres-
sion, we can reduce Eq. (*) to the form that is convenient for integ-
ration. After integrating over the whole layer we obtain SU = 
= —ym 61111r. And finally, integrating over all layers of the sphere, 
we obtain U = —ymM/r; (b) Fr  = —0U/Or = —ymM/r2.

1.212. First let us consider a thin spherical layer of substance 
(Fig. 9). Construct a cone with a small angle of taper and the vertex 
at the point A. The ratio of the areas cut out by the cone in the layer 
is dSi  : 
dS2  =71 : 71. The masses of the cut volumes are proportion-
al to their areas. Therefore these volumes will attract the particle A 
with forces equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. What 
follows is obvious.

each element with all others is SU = —vm SmIR. Summing over all

2.204. Let us apply Eq. (2.4e) to the reversible isothermic cycle 
1-2-3-4-5-3-1: 
T §dS =§dU-1-§pdV. 
Since the first two integrals are equal to zero, 
p dV = 0 as well. 
The latter equality is possible only when areas I and II are equal. 
Note that this reasoning is inapplicable to the cycle 1-2-3-1, for 
example. It is irreversible since it involves the irreversible transi-
tion at point 3 from a single-phase to a diphase state.

3.153. Imagine the voltage V to be applied across the points A 
and B. Then V = IR = I 0R0, where I is the current carried by the 
lead wires, 10  is the current carried by the conductor AB. 
The current /0  can be represented as a superposition of two cur-
rents. If the current I flowed into point A and spread over the 
infinite wire grid, the conductor AB would carry (because of symmet-
ry) the current 1/4. Similarly, if the current I flowed into the grid 
from infinity and left the grid through point B, the conductor AB 
would also carry the current I/4. Superposing both of these solutions, 
we obtain /0  = 1/2. Therefore, R = R0/2.

0. The spatial 
derivatives of the field E, however, may not be equal to zero 
(V x E 	
0) only in the presence of an electric field. 
(b) If B (t), then V X E = 	 0. But in the uniform 
field V x E = 0. 
(c) It is assumed that E = of (t), where a is a vector which is 
independent of the coordinates, f (t) is an arbitrary function of time. 
Then —awat = V X E = 0, that is the field B does not vary with 
time. Generally speaking, this contradicts the equation V x H = 
= apiat for in this case its left-hand side does not depend on time 
whereas its right-hand side does. The only exception is the case 
when f (t) is a linear function. In this case the uniform field E can 
be time-dependent. 
3.356. Let us find the divergence of the two sides of the equation 
V X H = j 	
°plat. Since the divergence of a rotor is always equal 
to zero, we get 0 = V•j + 4F  (V •D). It remains to take into 
account that V•D = p. 
3.357. Let us consider the divergence of the two sides of the 
first equation. Since the divergence of a rotor is always equal to 
zero, V • (mat) = 0 or --a-Fa  (V•B) = 0. Hence, V•B = const which 
does not contradict the second equation.

3.371. Suppose the charge q moves in the positive direction of 
the x axis of the reference frame K. Let us pass into the frame K' 
at whose origin of coordinates this charge is at rest (the x and x' 
axes of the two frames coincide and the y and y' axes are parallel). 
In the frame K' the field of the charge has the simplest form: E' 
= 4n

q 	
, 	1 	
q 
4neo  r's x 	4neo  is Y • 
Now let us make the reverse transition to the initial frame K. At the 
moment when the charge q passes through the origin of coordinates 
of the frame K, the x and y projections of the vector r are related 
to the x and y' projections of the vector r' as 
x = r cos 0 = x1 1/ 1 — (v/c)2, y = r sin 0 = y', 
Besides, in accordance with the formulas that are reciprocal to 
Eqs. (3.6i),

objective's focal plane, with their zeroth maxima being separated

by an angle * (Fig. 41). As the distance d decreases the angle 0 be-
tween the neighbouring maxima in each diffraction pattern increases, 
and when 0 becomes equal to 2*, the first deterioration of visi-
bility occurs: the maxima of one system of fringes coincide with the 
minima of the other system. Thus, from the condition 0 = 2p and 
the formula sin 0 = Xld we obtain , = X/2d ge, 0.06".

5.164. (a) Let us represent the natural light as a sum of two mutual-

polarizer transmits in its plane the fraction a, of the light with 
oscillation plane parallel to the polarizer's plane, and the fraction 
cc, with oscillation plane perpendicular to the polarizer's plane. 
The intensity of light transmitted through the system of two pola-

5.187. (a) The light with right-hand circular polarization (from 
the observer's viewpoint) becomes plane polarized on passing through 
a quarter-wave plate. In this case the direction of oscillations of 
the electric vector of the electromagnetic wave forms an angle of 
+45° with the axis 00' of the crystal (Fig. 43a); in the case of left-
hand polarization this angle will be equal to —45° (Fig. 43b). 
(b) If for any position of the plate the rotation of the Polaroid 
(located behind the plate) does not bring about any variation in 
the intensity of the transmitted light, the initial light is natural; 
if the intensity of the transmitted light varies and drops to zero, 
the initial light is circularly polarized; if it varies but does not 
drop to zero, then the initial light is composed of natural and cir-
cularly polarized light.

i.e. the light propagates as a plane wave whose amplitude depends

the wave due to absorption). When n' = ix, then 
A= AO" cos wt. 
This is a standing wave whose amplitude decreases exponentially 
(if x < 0). In this case the light experiences total internal reflection

ally identical in the reference frames fixed to the source and to the 
receiver. Suppose that the source emits short pulses with the inter-
vals To. Then in the reference frame fixed to the receiver the distance 
between two successive pulses is equal to X = — v,-To, when 
measured along the observation line. Here vr  is the projection of the 
source velocity on the observation line (v,. = v cos 0). The frequency 
of received pulses v = clk = v01(1 — vile), where vo  = 1/To. Hence

where d' = d yi - (v/c)2. The corresponding "natural" frequency

5.243. The field induced by a charged particle moving with 
velocity V excites the atoms of the medium turning them into sources 
of light waves. Let us consider two 
arbitrary points A and B along the 
path of the particle. The light waves 
emitted from these points when the 
particle passes them reach the point 
P (Fig. 44) simultaneously and amplify 
each other provided the time taken 
by the light wave to propagate from 
the point A to the point C is equal 
to that taken by the particle to fly 
over the distance AB. Hence, we 
obtain cos 0 = v/V, where v = c/n is the phase velocity of light. 
It is evident that the radiation is possible only if V > v, i.e. when 
the velocity of the particle exceeds the phase velocity of light in 
the medium.

oxra  +7;_y;....kk2t=._ 0 , k2=2mElh2. 
Let us take the origin of coordinates at one of the corners of the 
well. On the sides of the well the function * (x, y) must turn into 
zero (according to the condition), and therefore it is convenient to 
seek this function inside the well in the form 1) (x, y) = a sin kix X 
x sin key, since on the two sides (x = 0 and y = 0) = 0 automa-
tically. The possible values of k1  and k2  are found from the condi-
tion of 1 
 turning into zero on the opposite sides of the well: 
* (4, y) = 0, k1  = ± (n/h) nl,

(x, 12) = 0, k2  = f (7t112) n2, n2  = 1, 2, 3,

tion leads to the relation lc; + k2 = k2, whence

Since the discontinuity U is finite the integral tends to zero as

function it follows that a = 0 and c = O. And finally, from the 
continuity of 1) (x) and its derivative at the point x = 1 we obtain 
tan kl = —k/x, whence 
sin kl = t kl 
h2/2m/zUo. 
Plotting the left-hand and right-hand sides of the last equation 
(Fig. 45), we can find the points at which the straight line crosses 
the sine curve. The roots of the equation corresponding to the eigen-
values of energy E are found from those intersection points (kl)i  
for which tan (kl)i  < 0, i.e. the roots of that equation are located 
in the even quadrants (these segments of the abscissa axis are shown 
heavy in the figure). It is seen from the plot that the roots of the 
equation, i.e. the bound states of the particle, do not always exist. 
The dotted line indicates the ultimate position of the straight line.

Now it remains to take into account that Pa  +P i = 1; then Pa = 
= 2/(4 + 3n) = 14.9%. 
The penetration of the particle into the region where its energy 
E < U is a purely quantum phenomenon. It occurs owing to the 
wave properties of the particle ruling out the simultaneous precise 
magnitudes of the coordinate and the momentum, and consequently 
the precise division of the total energy of the particle into the poten-
tial and the kinetic energy. The latter could be done only within 
the limits set by the uncertainty principle. 
6.87. Utilizing the substitution indicated, we get 
x" k2x = 0, where k2  = 2mE/h2. 
We shall seek the solution of this equation in the form x = 
= a sin (kr + a). From the finiteness of the wave function , at 
the point r= 0 it follows that a = 0. Thus, = (alr) sin kr. From 
the boundary condition * (r0) = 0 we obtain kr, = nn, where 
n = 1, 2, . . . Hence, Ea  = n23-E2h212m,r:.

From the continuity of the function

As it was demonstrated in the solution of Problem 6.85, this equa-

6.94. (a) Let us write the solutions of the Schrodinger equation 
to the left and to the right of the barrier in the following form: 
x < 0, 14)i (x)=aieihiH- bie-ikix, where k1 = V-2mElh, 
x> 0, 
2  (x) = a2eih2x 
b2e-ih2s, where k2  = -1(2m (E —U0)1h. 
Let us assume that the incident wave has an amplitude a1  and the 
reflected wave an amplitude b2. Since in the region x >0 there is 
only a travelling wave, b2  = 0. The reflection coefficient R is the 
ratio of the reflected stream of particles to the incident stream, or, 
in other words, the ratio of the squares of amplitudes of correspond-
ing waves. Due to the continuity of* and its derivative at the point 
= 0 we have a1 	
b1  = a2  and al  — bi  = (k21k1) a2, whence 
R =(b1/a1)2 =  (ki—  k2)2/(k1  + k2)2. 
(b) In the case of E < U0  the solution of the SchrOdinger equa-
tion to the right of the barrier takes the form 
11,2  (x) = a2e" b2e--", where x =2m (U0  — E)1h. 
From the finiteness of 
(x) it follows that a2  = 0. The probability 
of finding the particle under the barrier has the density P2 (x) = 
114 (x)— e-2". Hence, xefi  = 1/2x.

This is the third volume in the series of textbooks written by the author 
for physics students at colleges and universities. The first two books 
(Molecular Physics and Electricity and Magnetism) were published in 
1985 and 1986. 
The material presented in this book is developed on the basis of the 
electromagnetic theory. Fourier transformations have been used for 
monochromatic, nonmonochromatic and random radiation. The 
description of traditional aspects is supplemented by a discussion of 
problems from the branches that have been developed intensively over 
the last 15-20 years.These include Fourier optics, Fourier analysis of 
random signals, matrix methods in geometric optics, holography, 
lasers, nonlinear phenomena, etc. 
Contents. Electromagnetic Waves. Nonmonochromatic and Random 
Radiation. Light Propagation in Isotropic Media. Geometric Optics. 
Interference. Diffraction. Fourier Optics. Light Propagation in 
Anisotropic Media. Dispersion. Generation of Light. Nonlinear 
Phenomena in Optics.
