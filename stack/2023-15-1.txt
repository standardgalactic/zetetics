When a hyperelastic hydrogel confined between two parallel glass plates begins to dry from a lateral
boundary, the volume lost by evaporation is accommodated by an inward displacement of the air-hydrogel
interface that induces an elastic deformation of the hydrogel. Once a critical front displacement is reached,
we observe intermittent fracture events initiated by a geometric instability resulting in localized bursts at the
interface. These bursts relax the stresses and irreversibly form air cavities that lead to cellular networks. We
show that the spatial extent of the strain field prior to a burst, influenced by the air-hydrogel interfacial
tension and the confinement of the gel, determines the characteristic size of the cavities.

Cracks in paintings and colloidal suspensions [1,2],
buckling of pollen grains [3], and columnar joint formation
in rocks [4] are examples where multiphase solids develop
patterns as the solvent evaporates. The interplay between
drying-induced shrinkage gradients in the material and
geometric constraints induces mechanical stresses that lead
to structural deformation and failure [5–7]. In evaporating
sessile drops and films of colloidal suspensions, intricate
fracture patterns form in the dried close-packed particle
deposit, characterized by brittle cracks that are governed by
the release of flow-induced tensile stresses [8–11]. In
polymer gels, where the solvent concentration is typically
higher, evaporation can induce large shrinkage before the
material reaches an arrested glassy state [5]. This affects the
resulting morphologies; during the drying of a cylindrical
piece of gel, for example, the deformation is not sufficient
to induce patterns, unless a glassy crust forms on the
softer inner gel and wrinkles develop [12]. However, under
strong geometrical constraints, such as in confinement,
larger elastic deformations might emerge. In highly
stretchable materials subjected to fluid injection or tensile
tests, instabilities and material failure resulting from non-
linear mechanics at large deformations have been reported
[13–20]. Here we probe the regime where nonlinear
deformations are induced by solvent evaporation.
We report a unique type of cellular pattern growth that
emerges in highly deformable hydrogels confined between
two parallel plates [Fig. 1(a)]; upon drying, air cavities
intermittently burst into the hydrogel creating a cellular
network of cavities, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The temporal
evolution of the interface reveals two regimes of growth: a
slow expansion of a cavity to a critical front displacement
followed by an irreversible fracture that leads to the
formation of a new cavity. Following such an event, the
surrounding air-hydrogel interface recedes indicating a
relaxation of elastic stresses as a new cavity emerges.
The characteristic size of the cavities increases with
increasing spacing between the two plates and decreases

weakly with the hydrogel modulus. We rationalize this
selection of cavity size in a scaling model that accounts for
the elastic strain stored in the deformed hydrogel, which are
affected by the interfacial tension at the air-hydrogel
interface.
Drying experiments are performed in cells made of two
microscope glass plates of length 25 mm, width 25 mm and
thickness 1 mm. The spacing between the plates ranges
from b ¼ 5–250 μm controlled by calibrated spacers
(Precision Brand) or by UV-polymerized SU-8 photoresist
(MicroChem). The cells are sealed on three sides to induce
evaporation from the one open side only. The adhesion
between the hydrogel and the cell is ensured by coating the
glass plates with acrylate brushes (Sigma-Aldrich) [21].
Drying takes place in a closed transparent container at
temperatures of T ¼ 23 °C or T ¼ 50 °C, and at relative
humidity < 10%. The final drying pattern is unaffected by
temperature in this range. The patterns are imaged on an
inverted microscope (Eclipse TE2000-U, Nikon) equipped
with a digital camera (Lumix GH5) or a high-speed camera
(Photron). Data are extracted from photographs of the final
dried samples, or from time-lapse images recorded at frame
rates of 0.5, 1, or 400 frames= sec.
The hydrogels are composed of polyacrylamide at con-
centrations ranging from 3–8 wt%. Acrylamide monomers
(Bio-Rad Laboratories), the crosslinker bis-acrylamide
(Bio-Rad Laboratories), the initiator potassium persulfate
(Sigma-Aldrich)
and
the
catalyst
tetramethyldiamine
(Sigma-Aldrich) are mixed in deionized water [22]. The
solution is filled into the cell in the liquid state by capillary
action or injection. Gelation occurs in a water-saturated
desiccator for two hours. The hydrogels have storage moduli
ranging between G0 ≡G ¼ 11–2200 Pa, as measured
in the linear elastic regime using a stress-controlled rhe-
ometer (AR-G2, TA Instruments). The hydrogels are highly
deformable and exhibit failure strains > 100% [22].
At the end of the drying process, the hydrogels exhibit
morphologies that are distinct from those observed in
confined close-packed colloidal deposits, where drying
induces straight cracks [2,23–25]. Instead, we observe a
network of air cavities separated by thin walls composed of
dried hydrogel and connected through small air openings,
as shown in Fig. 1(b). The cavities form in the bulk of the
hydrogel, as evidenced by the existence of dried gel on both
glass plates observed upon opening the cell.
We follow the growth of the air cavities via time-lapse
imaging under an optical microscope. In a first stage, the
flat air-hydrogel interface advances inward as water evap-
orates. The interface eventually destabilizes into regularly
spaced air fingers [Figs. 2(a),2(b)]. These fingers are
similar to those observed as confined hydrogels are
deformed via fluid injection or in debonding experiments,
and are the result of a reversible elastic instability [15–17].
In a second stage, larger cavities appear through localized
and intermittent bursts at the destabilized interface, which
invade the entire hydrogel, as shown in Figs. 2(c)–2(f).
The bursts are irreversible events that locally fracture the
hydrogel. Focusing on a single cavity, the interface first
grows slowly, expanding radially by a displacement
δ [Fig. 2(g)]. When a critical value δc is reached [Fig. 2(h)],
a new cavity emerges by a rapid irreversible growth
[Figs. 2(i)–2(k)]. The process is then repeated as the drying
front progresses through the system.
As water evaporates from the hydrogel, the hydrophilic
gel initially deforms elastically while losing water from
within the matrix. This leads to a buildup of elastic stress,
primarily in the vicinity of the air-hydrogel interface [5]
where water loss is largest. The poroelastic deformation of
the polymer matrix driven by water flow has an associated
timescale given by τp ¼ ðηbδÞ=ðGξ2Þ, where η is the water
viscosity, δ the front displacement, and ξ the hydrogel
pore size [26]. We evaluate the importance of poroelastic

effects by comparing τp with the characteristic loading
time τe ¼ δ=˙r, where ˙r is related to the air-hydrogel
interface velocity [22]. This yields τp=τe ¼ ηb˙r=ðGξ2Þ.
Using representative values of ξ ∼100 nm [27] and
˙r ∼10−7 m=s, we find τp=τe ∼10−4–10−1 for the range
of G and b investigated [22]. Poroelastic effects are
thus negligible during the slowly moving phase of the
drying front.
To probe the relaxation of the air-hydrogel interface that
occurs upon a burst, we define the area of the network of
cavities that are formed at time Δt as AnetðΔtÞ and the area
of the new cavity at time Δt as AcavðΔtÞ. The area ratio
ΓðΔtÞ ¼ ðAnetðΔt ¼ 0Þ −AnetðΔtÞÞ=AcavðΔtÞ then corre-
sponds to the ratio of the newly lost network area from
the relaxing air-hydrogel interface and the area gained from
the newly formed cavity. To quantify the spatial extent of
the interface relaxation, we measure ΓðΔtÞ within circular
masks of diameter d centered on the new cavity, as shown
in Fig. 3(a) for Δt ¼ 0.1 and Δt ¼ 1 s. We find that Γ
increases with increasing mask diameter and reaches a
plateau value Γ ∼0.9 at a critical mask diameter dc that
characterizes the spatial extent lel of the stress field at the
onset of a burst. This almost complete area conservation
indicates that a burst induces a simple elastic relaxation of
the hydrogel matrix via cavity formation.
To characterize the cavity size, we analyze photographs
of fully dried samples and find that the cavity area Acav
increases monotonically from the initial front location at
x ¼ 0 and reaches a constant value A∞
cav in the interior of the
cell, as shown in Fig. 3(b) for a hydrogel with G ¼ 80 Pa
and b ¼ 25 μm. We define an average cavity size in the
plateau regime as Lcav ¼ ð1=NÞ PN

, where N is
the total number of cavities, and find that Lcav increases
with increasing plate spacing and decreases weakly with
the hydrogel modulus, as shown in Figs. 4(a),4(b). The
critical front displacement at burst δc, by contrast, is
independent of G and increases linearly with b, as shown
in the inset of Fig. 4(b). This rules out that the sudden burst
at the end of the slow growth regime is triggered as the front
displacement reaches the failure strain of the hydrogel
measured in rheology, as this failure strain exhibits a strong
dependence on G [22].
The independence of the burst strain δc=b on the
hydrogel modulus suggests a triggering mechanism that
is purely geometric. This is reminiscent of a reversible
elastic instability of geometric origin observed as air is
injected into bulk polyacrylamide hydrogels [15]. Such
instability can trigger an irreversible fracture that prop-
agates across the material [14]. Instead, in the present case
of evaporation-driven loading under confinement, we
observe multiple arrested fractures that lead to cavities
of well-defined length scale. To rationalize this distinct
phenomenology, we consider (i) that the elastic instability
occurs as the air-hydrogel interface reaches a critical front
displacement δc ∼b, (ii) that this instability triggers a
fracture, and (iii) that the area of gel lost upon a cavity
burst is recovered in the vicinity of the burst, as sketched in
Fig. 4(c). During slow cavity growth, the strain grows to a
value that scales as ðγ=bGÞ þ fðδÞ, since the interfacial
pressure jump scales as γ=b, where γ is the air-hydrogel
interfacial tension and fðδÞ the elastic deformation from the
evaporation [28].
For γ=bG ≪1 where interfacial tension effects are
negligible, the drying in the slow growth regime is
accompanied by the buildup of a strain field of spatial
extent lel that is set by the smaller of the geometric length
scales given by the plate spacing, lel ∼b [16]. In this

regime, the interface curvature evolves to optimize the
elastic energy stored in the matrix. For γ=bG ≫1, the high
cost for creating new interface results in a smaller curvature
than that adopted if interfacial tension effects are negligible,
which induces a larger strain close to the two plates. This
larger strain at the plates is accommodated by a larger
spatial extent of the strain field into the hydrogel, which we
hypothesize to be set by the elastocapillary length scale
lel ∼γ=G in this regime [29].
The formation of a cavity relaxes the stresses over the
length scale lel, which together with the area conservation
upon a burst when δ ¼ δc suggests that L2cav ∼lelδc.

In summary, we show how the evaporation of a confined
hydrogel induces the irreversible growth of cellular patterns
of air cavities with well-defined characteristic size. The
burst of a new cavity occurs at a critical front displacement
that is independent of the hydrogel modulus and set by
the geometric confinement. We rationalize the size of the
cavities by considering the elastic strain stored in the
material at the onset of a burst whose spatial range can
be affected by interfacial tension effects. Our work paves
the way for theoretical work on drying-induced instabilities
in strongly deformable materials. For example, the neo-
Hookean framework developed in [16,17,29] might be
expanded to include an elastic energy density function that
considers a strain induced by material loss from evapora-
tion, as well as irreversible effects due to damage and
failure. Along another axis, our work shows that complex
structures and specific length scales can be “encoded”
within the material through mechanical constraints. Going
beyond the evaporation protocols commonly used in the
industrial production of homogeneous films, this could
open new avenues for fabrication, for example, by design-
ing topographic constraints induced by spatially variable
confinement and moduli, or by utilizing nematic gels.
