Y
Young’s Modulus
Young’s modulus, E, is the ratio
E ¼ uniaxial stress
uniaxial strain
Poisson’s ratio, nP, indicates how a sample changes its shape:
nP ¼ transverse strain
normal strain
Young’s Slits
In the Young’s slits experiment, a diﬀraction pattern is observed on
a screen placed behind an opaque screen with two parallel slits a
short distance apart and illuminated with monochromatic light
(Figure Y.1). A diﬀraction pattern is also seen if the light is replaced

by a monochromatic stream of electrons, so confirming their wave-
like character. The pattern is observed even when the intensity of the
beam is reduced to the point that only one electron at a time passes
through the slits, suggesting that the electron senses the presence of a
second slit even though it is passing through another slit. This para-
dox, which arises from improperly mixing position and momentum
descriptions, is resolved by expressing the entire apparatus, including
the screen with its slits, in a wave (linear momentum) formalism and
invoking the conservation of linear momentum in the interaction of
the wavelike electrons and the wavelike recreation of the screen with its
slits.
