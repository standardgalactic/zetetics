FOREWORD
/ have drawn pom

"well of language many
a
thought which
I do not have and which
I could not
put into words.
C. G. Lichtenberg
Many who write about 'linguistics' go astray because they
overlook the fundamental fact that we use words for two
quite
different
purposes;
as
a
code
of
communication
whereby,
as
individual members
of
the human
race, we
can request and supply information necessary to
life, and
as Speech in the true sense, the medium in which, as unique
persons who think in the
first and second person singular,
we gratuitously disclose ourselves to each other and share
our experiences.
Though no human utterance
is either
a
pure code statement or a pure personal act, the difference
is obvious if we compare a phrase-book for tourists travel-
ling abroad with
a poem. The former
is concerned with
needs common to
all human beings; hence, for the phrases
given,
there
exist more
or
less
exact
equivalents
in
all
languages. No poem, on the other hand, can be even ap-
proximately
translated
into any
other language. A
poet,
one might say,
is someone who tries to give an experience
its Proper Name, and
it is a characteristic of Proper Names
that they cannot be translated, only transliterated.
Further-
more, precisely because writing poetry
is a gratuitous act,
5

Foreword
in
it, as Valery observed, "everything which must be said,
is almost impossible to say well."
Whereas most code statements are verifiable or disprov-
able, most personal utterances are neither; they can only be
believed, doubted or denied. When we speak
as persons,
capable of good and
evil, the important question
is not
'Is
what we say the case or not?', but 'Are we speaking the
truth, or deceiving ourselves, or deliberately lying?'
Many animals possess a code for communicating vital in-
formation about food,
sex,
the presence of enemies,
etc.,
and in social animals like the bee this code may be extremely
complex.
It
is even
possible
that,
in the case of animals,
geese, for example, which are capable of forming personal
bonds between
individuals,
their
sound-and-gesture
code
may have an element of personal expression but, even if this
be
so,
it
is secondary, whereas, in the case of human lan-
guage, personal speech
is its primary function, to which its
use as a code is subordinate.
If this were not so, then, like
all other species, we should
only have one language, used and understood by
all human
beings, with at most slight regional dialect differences, like
the song of the chaffinch, and this language would undergo
no historical change, but remain the same from generation
to generation.
But from the beginning, not only have men
spoken many
different languages,
all subject
to
historical
change, but
also no two persons with
the same mother-
tongue speak
it
in exactly the same way.
Understanding
what another human being says to us
is always a matter of
translation.
In this book, Mr Barfield
is trying to help us
to translate correctly, instead of making, as we all too often
do, the most elementary errors.

Foreword
True understanding
is
unattainable without both
love
and detachment, and we can only learn to view anything
with detachment by comparing
it with other things which
are both
like and
unlike
it. We cannot understand
the
present without a knowledge of the
past, our native land
without having spent some time in a foreign country, our
mother-tongue without
a working knowledge
of
at
least
two other languages.
Without such knowledge, our love
of ourselves at the present moment, of our country, of our
language, remains an ignorant idolatry, exemplified by the
Frenchman who said: "The great advantage of the French
language is that in
it the words occur in the order in which
one thinks them."
In weaning us from this idolatry, the historical approach
employed by Mr Barfield seems to me much more
likely
to be effective than the approach of the linguistic analysts.
The latter seem to believe that, by a process of 'demythol-
ogising' and
disinfecting,
it should be possible to create
a
language in which,
as
in algebra, meanings would be un-
equivocal
and
misunderstanding
impossible.
But human
language
is mythological and metaphorical by nature.
As
Thoreau
said:
"All perception of truth
is a perception of
an analogy; we reason from our hands to our heads." Mr
Barfield gives many fascinating illustrations of this process.
The English words delirious and prevaricate, for example,
are derived from the Latin verbs, delirare and praevaricari,
which originally meant, he
tells
us,
'to go out of the fur-
row
1
and
'to
plough
in
crooked
lines'.
A
secular
and,
therefore,
fool-proof language
is an unphilosophical day-
dream. We can only cope with the dangers of language if
we recognize that language is by nature magical and there-
7

Foreword
fore
highly dangerous.
It
will always be
possible to use
language,
as
a demagogue
uses
it,
as Black Magic which
neither,
like
a communication code,
supplies people with
information they need to know, nor, like Speech, asks for
a personal and therefore unpredictable response, but seeks
to extort from others mindless tautological echoes of itself.
"We must not
forget," Mr
Barfield reminds
us,
"that
nine-tenths of the words comprising the vocabulary of
a
civilised nation are never used by more than
at most one
tenth of the population; while of the remaining tithe, nine-
tenths of those who use them are commonly aware of about
one-tenth of their meanings."
Until quite recently, this did not matter very much. Be-
fore the spread of semi-literacy and the development of the
mass media, the language used by the nine-tenths was the
language they had learned at first-hand from their parents
and their next-door neighbors.
Their vocabulary might be
limited, they might be aware of many of its possible mean-
ings, but with
it they were able to say what they meant to
say and to understand what was said to them. Their ignor-
ance of historical changes in the meanings of words was not
a serious handicap because they could not or had no desire
to read the
literature of the
past.
The age of innocence,
however, has come to an end and can never return. To-day,
when
all school children and college students are expected
to read some English Literature, the consequence of such
ignorance
is that a nineteen-year-old, confronted with the
lines,
The aged bloodhound rose and shook his hide,
But his sagacious eye an inmate owns.
can interpret them
as follows: "The poor dog was blind.

Foreword
Some lunatic had punched
his eye out and kept it."
To-day we must modify Mr Barfield's warning and say
that nine-tenths of the population use twice as many words
as they understand.
It
is no longer a matter of their know-
ing some of the possible meanings of the words they use;
they
attach meanings to them which are simply false. Thus
one can hear
a person, when he
is feeling
sick, say
/ am
nauseous;
a reviewer
of
a
spy-thriller can
describe
it
as
enervating; a famous television star can call a firm of invest-
ment brokers,
for which
he
is making
a
plug,
integrity -
ridden.
So befuddled, how can
the
man-in-the-street be
expected
to
resist
the
black magic
of
the
propagandists,
commercial and
political?
Formerly, philology could
re-
main
a study
for
specialists:
to-day,
History
in
English
Words, and
other books
like
it, must be made required
reading in all schools.
I have deliberately refrained from saying much about the
contents of Mr Barfield's book.
After reading
it, one
first
impulse
is to
tell others about the many facts in
it which
have surprised and delighted one.
I never knew before, for
instance, that the first recorded use of the word self-respect
in a favorable sense—hitherto
it had always been a pejora-
tive, akin to selfishness—occurs in Wordsworth's poem The
Excursion.
One's second impulse is to cite further examples
of
significant meaning-changes.
I am
fascinated,
for
ex-
ample, by euphemisms and would very much like to know
exactly when
it was
first thought tactful to
call the poor
under-privileged and the old senior citizens.
But, on reflec-
tion, one
realises
that asking such
questions
is
a form of
showing off, and that to quote extensively from a book of

Foreword
this kind
is as bad as telling readers in advance the solution
to a murder mystery.
It
is
a
privilege
to be allowed
to recommend
a book
which
is not only
a joy to read but
also
of great moral
value
as a weapon in the unending battle between
civilisa-
tion
and
barbarism.
As
Dag
Hammarskjold
wrote
in
Markings:
Respect for the ivord
is the first commandment in the
discipline by which
a man can be educated to maturity
—intellectual, emotional and moral.
Respect for the word— to employ
it with scrupulous
care and an incorruptible heartfelt love of truth—is essen-
tial
if there
is to be any growth
in a society
or
in the
human race.
To misuse the word
is to show contempt for man.
It
undermines the bridges and poisons the wells.
It causes
Man to regress down the long path of his evolution.
-W. H. Auden

. TIMBER
If
somebody showed us a document which he said was
an unpublished letter ofDr. Johnson's, and on reading
it through we came across the word 'telephone', we
should be fairly justified in sending him about his business.
The fact that there was no such thing as a telephone until
many years after Johnson's death would leave no doubt
whatever in our minds that the letter was not written by
him. Ifwe cared to go farther, we could say with equal cer-
tainty that the letter was written since the beginning of the
nineteenth century, when the telephone was invented.
Now suppose that there had been nothing about tele-
phones in the letter, but that it had contained an account of
a thunder-storm. Ifin describing the stillness just before the
storm broke the writer had said that 'the atmosphere was
electric', we could
still be fairly positive that he was not
Dr. Johnson. But this time
it would not be because the
thing ofwhich the letter spoke had no existence inJohnson's
day. No doubt the heavens during a storm a hundred and
fifty years ago were as highly charged with electricity as
they are today; but if we look up the word electric in the
i5

Philology and the Aryans
Oxford Dictionary, we find that in Johnson's time it simply
was not used in that way. Thus, in his own dictionary it is
defined as:
'A property in some bodies, whereby when rubbed so as
to grow warm, they draw little bits of paper, or such-like
substances, to them.'
The world was only just beginning to connect this mys-
terious property of amber with the thunder and lightning,
and however
still and heavy the air might have been,
it
would have been impossible for the lexicographer to des-
cribe
it by that word. Or again, supposing the letter had
said nothing about a storm, but that it had described a con-
versation between Garrick and Goldsmith which was car-
ried on 'at high tension', we should still have little hesita-
tion in pronouncing
it to be a forgery. The phrase 'high
tension', used of the relation between human beings,
is a
metaphor taken from the condition of the space between
two electrically charged bodies. At present many people
who use such a phrase are still half-aware of its full mean-
ing, but many years hence everybody may be using it to
describe their quarrels and their nerves without dreaming
that it conceals an electrical metaphor—just as we ourselves
speak of a man's 'disposition' without at all knowing that
the reference is to astrology. 1 Nevertheless by consulting an
historical dictionary
it will
still be possible to 'date' any
passage of literature in which the phrase occurs. We shall
still know for certain that the passage could not have been
written in a time before certain phenomena of static elec-
tricity had become common knowledge.

Philology and the Aryans
Thus, the scientists who discovered the forces of electri-
city actually made
it possible for the human beings who
came after them to have a slightly different idea, a slightly
fuller consciousness of their relationship with one another.
They made it possible for them to speak of the
' high ten-
sion' between them. So that the discovery of electricity,
besides introducing several new words (e.g. electricity itself)
into our everyday vocabulary, has altered or added to the
meaning of many older words, such as
battery,
broadcast,
button,
conductor,
current,
force,
magnet,
potential,
tension,
terminal, wire, and many others.
But apart from the way in which it is used, there is a little
mine of history buried in the word electric itself. Ifwe look
it up in a dictionary we find that it is derived from a Greek
word 'elektron', which meant 'amber'. And in this etymo-
logy alone anyone who was completely ignorant of our
civilization could perceive three
facts—that
at one time
English scholars were acquainted with the language spoken
by the ancient Greeks, that the Greeks did not know of
electricity (for if they had there would have been nothing
to prevent our borrowing their word for it), and that the
idea of electricity has been connected in men's minds with
amber. Lastly, ifwe were completely ignorant of the qual-
ity ofamber itself, the fact that 'elektron' is connected with
'elektdr', which means 'gleaming' or 'the beaming sun',
might give us a faint hint of its nature. These are some ofthe
many ways in which words may be made to disgorge the
past that is bottled up inside them, as coal and wine, when
we kindle or drink them, yield up their bottled sunshine.
Now the deduction ofinformation from the presence or
absence of certain words is a common practice which has
n

Philology and the Aryans
been known to
critics and historians of literature, under
some such name as 'internal evidence', for many years. It is
from such evidence, for instance, that we deduce Shake-
speare's ignorance of the details ofRoman civilization. But
until a few years ago—within the memory of men
still
living—very
little use had been made of language
itself,
that is to say, ofthe historical forms and meanings ofwords
as interpreters both of the past and of the workings of
men's minds. It has only just begun to dawn on us that in
our own language alone, not to speak of its many com-
panions, the past history of humanity
is spread out in an
imperishable map, just as the history of the mineral earth
lies embedded in the layers of its outer crust. But there is
this difference between the record of the rocks and the
secrets which are hidden in language: whereas the former
can only give us a knowledge of outward, dead things
such as forgotten seas and the bodily shapes of prehistoric
animals and primitive men—language has preserved for us
the inner, living history of man's soul. It reveals the evolu-
tion ofconsciousness.
In the common words we use every day the souls ofpast
races, the thoughts and feelings of individual men stand
around us, not dead, but frozen into their attitudes like the
courtiers in the garden of the Sleeping Beauty. The more
common a word is and the simpler its meaning, the bolder
very likely is the original thought which it contains and the
more intense the intellectual or poetic effort which went to
its making. Thus, the word quality is used by most educated
people every day of their lives, yet in order that we should
have this simple word Plato had to make the tremendous
effort (it is one of the most exhausting which man is called
18

Philology and the Aryans
on to exert) of turning a vague feeling into a clear thought.
He invented the new word 'poiotes', 'what-ness',
as we
might say, or 'of-what-kind-ness', and Cicero translated it
by the Latin 'qualitas', from 'qualis'. Language becomes a
different thing for us altogether if we can make ourselves
realize, can even make ourselves feel how every time the
word quality is used, say upon a label in a shop window, that
creative effort made by Plato comes into play again. Nor is
the acquisition of such a feeling a waste of time; for once
we have made it our own, it circulates like blood through
the whole of the literature and life about us.
It is the kiss
which brings the sleeping courtiers to life.
But in order to excavate the information which is buried
in a word we must have the means to ascertain its history.
Until quite recently (about a hundred years ago) philology,
as an exact science, was still in its infancy, and words were
derived by ingenious guesswork from all kinds of impos-
sible
sources.
All languages were referred to a Hebrew
origin, since Hebrew was the language of the Bible. This
was
taken
for
granted. Since
then, however, two new
developments have revolutionized the whole study, made
it accurate, and enormously extended its scope. During the
eighteenth
century
Sanskrit,
the
ancient
speech of the
Hindoos, began for the first time to attract the attention of
European scholars. In 1767 a French Jesuit named Coeur-
doux pointed out certain resemblances between the Euro-
pean and Sanskrit languages. In 1786
Sir William Jones
described that language as being
'ofwonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more
copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than
19

Philology and the Aryans
either, yet bearing to both ofthem a stronger affinity, both
in the roots of verbs and in the forms of grammar, than
could have been produced by accident—so strong that no
philologer could examine all three without believing them
to have sprung from some common source which, perhaps,
no longer exists.'
At the time it was no more than a brilliant conjecture, but
with it the comparative philology of the Aryan languages
may be said to have begun.
Secondly, with the advent ofphonology certain apparent
laws were discovered governing the sounds made by the
human throat and the way in which these sounds change
with the passing of time and react upon each other when
they are knit together in a spoken word. Henceforward it
was
possible
to
say
for
certain
that,
for example,
the
English word wit (from the old verb 'witan', to know)
was not derived from the Latin 'videre', but cognate, or
related, with it. Many words derived from 'videre', such as
advice, envy, review, seem at first sight much farther offfrom
the stem
'vid-'
than
wit, but
it was now
possible
for
scholars to say definitely that a Latin stem 'vid' adopted
into English could not possibly have changed into wit. They
could be equally certain that,
if the Romans had borrowed
the Greek word
'idein'
(to
see)
into
their language,
it
could never have changed its form to 'videre', so that, in-
numerable as are the words which Rome borrowed from
Greece, 'videre' is not one of them. Thus, it was clear that
such groups of three words as idein, videre, and wit, or aster,
Stella, and star, were not father, son, and grandson (as is the
case, for instance, with poeine, poena, and penal), but three
20

Philology and the Aryans
brothers or cousins all descended from a common ancestor
with a stem something like 'weid' belonging to some other
language. This, put very briefly and with many omissions,
was the contribution made by phonology to the science of
comparative philology.
Perhaps it is not altogether insignificant that the study of
that seemingly dull subject—phonology—should be associ-
ated in our minds with one ofthe most charming collections
of fairy-tales in Europe. It is thanks to the labours ofJacob
Grimm during the first half of the last century that we are
now able to reconstruct the remote pasts of words, not, it is
true, with absolute certainty, but with a degree of it which
makes a chapter such as the present one worth writing. And
while Grimm was burrowing into the rich, loamy soil of
German speech and German
folk-lore, another German
scholar, Franz Bopp, was laying the foundations, with the
help of this knowledge and of the results of the study of
Sanskrit, of a genuinely scientific comparative philology.
Nor was it long before less scholarly but more imaginative
minds, such as Max Muller's, were interpreting the meaning
of their researches to a wider public.
We can imagine the suppressed excitement of the philo-
logists of that time as they began to discover in that remote
Eastern language, the sacred language of the Vedic hymns,
words such as 'vid'
(to see),
'tara'
(a star), 'sad'
(to
sit),
'bhratar'
(a brother). For it was not only the evident rela-
tion of Sanskrit to the languages of Europe that was excit-
ing. Sanskrit, which had preserved the forms of its words
more unchanged than any other Aryan tongue, threw a
brilliant light on the close relations existing between those
other languages
themselves.
For
instance,
although
the
21

Philology and the Aryans
sisterhood of words such
as
the Greek 'onoma',
Latin
'nomen', and name, had long been suspected, yet there had
been no way of distinguishing such
a
sisterhood from
purely accidental resemblances like Hebrew 'gol', Greek
'kaleo', and call, and the connection between 'brother' and
'frater' was by no means obvious. But when the older
Sanskrit form 'bhratar' was brought to light, the gap be-
tween these words was at once bridged. It could be seen at a
glance how the three of them,
brother,
bhratar, and frater,
had
started from the same
original form and diverged
through the years. Gradually all doubt was blown away,
and Sanskrit, the language of a race with whom Europeans
had thought, and for the most part still think, that they had
almost nothing in common, stood revealed as an obvious
relative of Latin, Greek, Modern English, and practically
all the other languages of Europe. It seemed, therefore, to
follow that our ancestors and those of the Hindoos were at
one time living together, that our ancestors and theirs were,
in fact, the same.
At first it was thought that Sanskrit itselfwas the parent-
language from which all the others had derived, and that
the nations of Europe were descended from a body of
Hindoos, some of whom had migrated westwards. We
called ourselves 'Aryans' because the people who had once
spoken Sanskrit were known as
' Aryas', or worshippers of
the God ofthe Brahmins. But soon the accurate methods of
analysis which philology had now acquired made it plain
that this could not be so. Therefore a still older language
was postulated and called indifferently the Aryan, the Indo-
Germanic, or the Indo-European parent-language. If there
was a language, there must have been a people who spoke
22

Philology and the Aryans
it, and attention was soon focused on the character, civiliza-
tion, and whereabouts in space and time of the people who
spoke the lost Indo-European, or 'Aryan' parent-language.
The fascination of this particular branch of philological
research is apparent when we recollect that in this case, in
the case of these remote Eastern ancestors—or predecessors
—of ours, philology
is almost the only window through
which we can look out on them.
In most subsequent
periods of history we have many other ways, besides the
study of language, of discovering the outward circum-
stances of men's lives. Historical records, archaeology, eth-
nology, folk-lore,
art, literature,
all come to our help in
considering, say, the ancient Egyptian civilization; but it is
not so with the Aryans. Here ethnology and archaeology tell
us practically nothing, anthropology a
little, and the rest
nothing at all. Ifwe wish to cross the darkness which separ-
ates us from this period we must lay down a little plank of
words and step delicately over
it. And in such romantic
circumstances it is hardly surprising that we should find a
veritable army of scholars and philosophers, both profes-
sional and amateur, jostling each other upon that plank with
such vigour that the bridge and its burden have often seemed
in danger ofvanishing quietly together into the abyss.
The
central
principle upon which
philologists
have
worked is this, that if a word occurs today in a fair sprink-
ling of the Aryan languages, then that word existed in the
Aryan parent-language, and therefore the thing ofwhich it
is the label existed in some form or other in the primitive
Aryan civilization. Conversely, if an object or an idea
is
found to have a different name in most of the Aryan lan-
guages, it was sometimes assumed that that object was not
23

Philology and the Aryans
known to the Aryans before their dispersion. But this nega-
tive deduction soon came to be regarded as unsafe, and
there are indeed many reasons why the whole method
is
limited and uncertain. For instance, even in one language it
is constantly happening that, when a new thing or a new
idea comes into the consciousness of the community,
it is
described, not by a new word, but by the name of the pre-
existing object which most closely resembles
it. This
is
inevitable. We have to proceed from the known to the
unknown in language as in life; but language lags behind
life and words change more slowly than things or ideas.
When railways first came in, their rolling-stock consisted
of a string of vehicles resembling the old horse coach so
exactly that
it was
said later that 'the ghost of a horse
stalked in front of the engine'. Although this is no longer
the case, we still call these vehicles carriages or coaches, and
look like continuing to do so. To take an even more patent
example, when a modern Englishman or American uses the
very old Celtic word car, we all know what he means: yet
it would be an error to deduce from this that the principle
of internal combustion was known in pre-Christian times
in Wales, Ireland, Cornwall, Brittany, and probably Rome
(Latin 'carrus', a cognate word). Moreover, we can see at
once that the fraction of error is very much greater whenwe
are dealing, not with the development of a word in one
language, but with
its history
as
it descended from one
language to another; for example, from the hypothetical
parent-tongue into the languages with which we are fami-
liar today. Indeed, this kind of reasoning, if no other evi-
dence were available, would lead us to conclude that the
Greeks were acquainted with electricity.
24

Philology and the Aryans
Fortunately, however,
it
is not the object of this
little
book to put forward theories and
discuss the extent to
which they can be proved or disproved by words. And
though it has been interesting to observe that in some cases
—and notably when we are endeavouring to reconstruct
the life and thought of our Aryan ancestors—our know-
ledge, such as it is, is derived very largely from the evidence
of words, yet in these pages, even when that particular
period is being dealt with, the words chosen for description
will by no means necessarily be those which provide the
most conclusive evidence for what is said. A great deal has
been done in quite recent years by way of collating the
results of comparative philology with those of anthropo-
logy, ethnology, comparative mythology, etc., and recon-
structing from the combined data something of the past
history ofour own and other races or cultures. We are con-
cerned here, not with the way in which those results were
arrived at, but with the results themselves. The reconstruc-
tion itself has been and is being done by scholars; here the
endeavour
is rather to make use of their labours; not to
think about the past, as it were, but to look at
it. Conse-
quently the words chosen are not the most useful ones, but
those which are the best telescopes; for while the nineteenth
century spent itselfprodigally in multitudinous endeavours
to know what the past was,
it is now possible for us, by
penetrating language with the knowledge thus accumu-
lated, to feel how the past is.
Who are the Aryans? Where did they come from? Look-
ing back down the corridor of time from the particular
perspective to which we have attained in the twentieth cen-
tury, far away in the past—it may be in the Stone Age
25

Philology and the Aryans
we seem to be able to perceive a remarkable phenomenon.
At some particular spot in the vast plains stretching from
Eastern Europe to Central Asia
it was as though a fresh
spring bubbled up into the pool of humanity. Whether it
represented the advent of a new 'race-type', what a race-
type exactly is, and how it begins are questions which we
must leave to others to settle. That spring was the Aryan
culture.
Throughout much ofEurope and Asia there were already
in
existence
different
civilizations
in
different
stages of
development; such were the Egyptian, the Chaldean, and
farther west the great Minoan
civilization, which in
its
Bronze Age was to ray out an influence from Crete all over
the Aegean world.
It may be that there was something
static 1 in the very nature of these pre-Aryan cultures, or it
may be that they were ageing and passing in the natural
course ofevents; what is certain is that there was something
dynamic, some organic, out-pushing quality in the waters
of this Aryan spring. For these waters spread. They have
been spreading over the world ever since that time, now
quickly, now slowly, down into India and Persia, north to
the Baltic, west over all Europe and the New World, until
in the persons ofthe three Aryan explorers, Peary, Amund-
sen, and Scott, their waves have licked the poles. It appears
to have been the tendency of the Aryan settler, whether he
came as a conquering invader or as a peaceful immigrant,
to obliterate more than he absorbed of the aboriginal cul-
ture on which he imposed himself. In this the Celts and
1 The linear writing of Cretan inscriptions has been pointed to by one
writer as a sign of this passivity. Philologists have also pointed out the impor-
tant position occupied by the verb in Aryan speech.
26

Philology and the Aryans
Teutons who ages ago overran most of Europe appear to
have resembled
the English-speaking
settlers who long
afterwards almost annihilated the North American Indian
with his gods and traditions. It is true that we English owe
to this latter pre-Aryan race the ability to express just that
shade of contempt which is conveyed by the word skunk,
also the charming blend of whimsicality and reprobation
crystallized in mugwump. But such survivals really only
emphasize the extent to which, as the Aryan waters spread,
the pre-Aryan past has been covered over. The past does
indeed live in the language we speak and in those with
which we are familiar, but it is the past ofthe Aryans. Ifwe
dig down far enough into the English language, we reach
an old civilization flourishing somewhere round the banks
ofthe Dnieper; ofwhat was going on in these islands at that
time we hear scarcely the faintest reverberation.
There is little doubt that the ancient inhabitants ofWest-
ern Europe as a whole differed from their Aryan successors
in two important customs. They buried their dead, whereas
the
Aryans
invariably
used
cremation;
and
they were
organized in systems ofmatriarchies. Aryan culture is patri-
archal to its foundations. We may patronize our less fortun-
ate neighbours, but we do not 'matronize' them. Yet faint
memories of such strange ways seem to have lingered on
among the Aryans in the widespread legend of a race of
Amazons who once dwelt in the lost continent of Atlantis,
the western land, and in the rumour of mighty female
warriors in pre-Celtic 1 Gaul, while the name of the River
Marne (Matrona) has been said to be another relic of the
1 Gaul was inhabited by Celts at least as early as the third century B.C. The
Galli, against whom Caesar fought, were Celtic tribes.

Philology and the Aryans
existence in pre-Aryan Europe ofa race ofmen who deified
their trees and streams, and hoped, when they died, to be
gathered to their mothers.
With this brief glance at our forgotten forerunners, we
may turn our gaze upon that region near the banks of the
Dnieper whence our own ancestors first began to expand
into the world. And we get a glimpse of the kind of settle-
ments in which these pastoral people must have lived in the
fact that the English word garden has grown from the same
stem as the termination -grad in Petrograd, where it means
'town', while on the other hand the Dutch for garden
is
'tuin'. We see their villages, family settlements springing
up in an enclosure round the home of a patriarch. House-
holds are large and cumbersome, the sons, as they grow up,
bring home wives from
different
villages, and
all
live
together under
the roof and
absolute dominion of the
mother and father-in-law. Both sexes wear zones or loin-
cloths, and probably in addition one simple garment of fur
or ofsome woven material, which does not altogether hide
their tattooed bodies, adorned with armlets and necklaces
of animals' teeth, or it may be of shells or amber beads. It is
the business of the women in these communities, not only
to remain faithful to their husbands on pain of the most
appalling penalties, not only to bring up the children, to
keep house, and to weave and spin, but also to till the fields
and look after the
bees, geese, oxen, sows, and such other
animals as may have been domesticated. A hard enough
life, but they have their consolations as they grow older and
become respected as dames. Moreover, they have a reli-
gious cult of their own. In some cases their imaginations are
rich in myth, and they are looked up to as knowing the
28

Philology and the Aryans
secrets of Nature and possibly of the future itself It is the
men's business to make war, hold councils, and hunt—pos-
sibly with horses 1 and hounds, both ofwhich animals are at
any rate known to them. The family lives on a kind of un-
leavened bread,
milk,
cheese, 2 cooked meats, vegetables,
and some fruits.
There
is much brutality. Widows may be expected to
join their husbands in the grave, and old men are some-
times killed offto make room; nevertheless, life is not with-
out its friendlier aspect. There is little doubt, for instance,
that our Aryan
ancestors knew how to get drunk. The
liquor, made principally of honey, with which they sent
themselves to bed, appears to have been fraught with such
sweet
associations
that no branch of the Aryan family,
however far they went upon their travels, could forget it.
The Angles and Saxons brought this mead into our country,
and the word occurs in Dutch, Icelandic, Danish, Swedish,
German,
Irish,
Lithuanian,
Russian,
Greek
('methu'),
Sanskrit, Zend, and modern Persian. As it threads its way
through this babel of tongues, ringing the changes on the
meanings of 'honey', 'drunkenness', and 'enjoyment', the
little monosyllable seems to give us a peculiarly intimate
peep into the interior of an Aryan home. Yet the connec-
tion of the word bed with the Latin stem 'fod-' (fodio), 'to
dig', should prevent us from forming an unduly voluptuous
image of the final stages of this prehistoric pastime. If we
call up before us a roof and walls of wood or wattles,
bounding a dark interior crowded with human beings and
possibly some cattle, lit only by a draughty hole in the roof
1 Greek 'hippos'; Lithuanian 'asva', etc.
2 Greek 'turos', from which was formed 'bouturon' (butter).
29

Philology and the Aryans
—an arrangement which the Teutons were evidently trying
to express when they afterwards dubbed it a 'wind's eye' or
window—we have a picture which will serve. It is a picture
of our ancestors just before they began to spread out over
the world, and the time is before 2000 B.C.
But the question of the houses in which they lived takes
us farther back
still. At some time, probably before they
became acquainted with agricultural modes of livelihood,
the Aryans were living a nomadic existence. Axle, nave,
wheel, yoke, and a common word for 'waggon' have con-
vinced people that they once moved from place to place in
a kind of primitive caravan, running probably on solid
wheels (for there is no common word for 'spoke'). Now
the English word cove, which in its Icelandic form means
'hut' and in its Greek form ('gupe') a subterranean dwell-
ing such as that which was inhabited by the Cyclops, takes
us back to a
still older form of residence. Again, wand in
English means a 'slender rod', but in German and Dutch it
means a 'wall', while the weightier and more solid word
timber is connected with the Greek root 'dem-' (demein),
'to build', Latin 'domus', 'a house'. In these words we can
perhaps see the most ancient house rising as time goes on
out of a natural cave in the ground to the dignity of a sort
of dug-out with wattled sides and roof—eventually to the
estate of a firm, wooden hut. And so, behind the picture of
our ancestors as they lived together on the spot from which
they finally began to spread, we can discern another less
certain picture of the very beginnings; of a race, a family
perhaps, or some voluntary collection of men not tied by
blood, who were together in the Stone Age somewhere in
Central Asia. They increase in numbers and power, and,
30

Philology and the Aryans
trekking westwards, live—for how many years or centuries
we cannot tell—as a race of pastoral nomads, until some-
where in the region of the Dnieper they pass from the
wandering nomad existence to some more settled life such
as that which has been described.
In addition to the somewhat prosaic words from which
we have attempted to derive information,
it is pleasant to
us to think ofthese ancestors ofours already uttering to one
another in that remote past great and simple words like
fire, night, star, thunder, and wind, which our children
still
learn to use as they grow up. And we must think also how
during all this time the new thing, the force, the spirit which
the Aryans were to bring into the world, must have been
simmering
within
them.
Strengthening
their
physique
through the generations by stricter notions of matrimony,
working by exogamy upon their blood, and through that
perhaps upon some quality of brightness and sharpness in
their thought, the Aryans became—Aryans. 1 And then they
began to move. And the result was the Bhagavad Gita, the
Parthenon frieze, the Roman Empire, and the Holy Roman
Empire—it was Buddha, Michelangelo, the plays of Shake-
speare, Bach, Goethe—it was Aristotle and Bacon, and the
vast modern industrial civilizations of Europe, Britain and
America reaching out to the Antipodes.
1 Terms such as 'nation',
'race',
'ancestors',
'descendants'
are used in
these chapters loosely, and without intending political or ethnological impli-
cations. The people referred to as 'Aryans' are the people who spoke the
Aryan language. They are clearly our cultural 'ancestors', and that is really
the only concern of this book, which was written several years before the
word 'Aryan' had been adopted as a racial shibboleth by the Nazi Party in
Germany.

It
would be a great mistake to picture the Aryans setting
out in some vast, organized expedition such as that of
the Israelites under Moses. The study of comparative
grammar suggests rather that they spread outwards from
their centre in a series of little rills, each one, as it flowed,
either pushing the
rill in front of it a stage farther on, or
flowing through
it and passing beyond. During the
first
thousand years of this process we have very little idea ofthe
extent to which the individual groups of these ever-widen-
ing circles—the different 'races' as they were perhaps now
beginning to be—were in communication with one an-
other. After a time, however, we can discern them pretty
sharply divided into two streams, a north-western and a
south-eastern stream. It was the main stream which flowed
north-west, and it carried along with it the ancestors of the
powerful races which were afterwards to be called Greeks,
Italians,
Slavs, Teutons, and Celts. The settlement of the
Celts in Britain and the subsequent arrival first of the Teu-
tonic Angles and Saxons and then of the Normans, the
32

The Settlement ofEurope
movement ofthe Celts westward to Wales and Ireland, and
the
final
streaming
of
their
Teutonic
successors
right
through them and across the Atlantic—all these are excel-
lent examples of the way in which the separate rills of the
north-western stream have continued ever since the
first
central commotion to crawl and mingle and overlap like
the waves ofan incoming tide.
Meanwhile
the
south-eastern
stream
flowed
past
the
Himalayas down into India and westward to Persia, where
their descendants became the Brahmanic Hindoos and the
Zoroastrian Persians of a later date.
That all connection was lost at a very early date between
these two main streams is suggested by another interesting
little group of words. These are common to all the mem-
bers of the north-western group, but quite unknown to the
south-eastern, and perhaps the most interesting is mere, the
Old English for
' sea', which is still used poetically ofinland
waters, and in the word mermaid, while
its Latin form
'mare'
is equally familiar to most educated Englishmen.
From
the
distribution of this word among
the Aryan
nations, together with similar equations such as fish and
piscis, we can deduce that these two groups oftravellers had
already separated before either of them reached the sea-
board.
There
is evidence, too, that this north-western group,
comprising
as
it
did
the
ancestors of the
Greeks
and
Romans,
as well as of the Celts, Teutons, and Slavs, had
reached, before it dispersed, a new country of forests, such
as must have covered most of Northern and Western
Europe at that time. At any rate we find words for trees
such as beech, elm, and hazel—and for birds—finch, starling,
33

The Settlement ofEurope
swallow, throstle—common to most ofthe languages spoken
by their descendants, yet absent from Persian and Sanskrit.
It was at this time, and amid these surroundings, that agri-
culture seems to have appeared among the north-western
Aryans. The old Aryan word from which we have acre lost
its former meaning of 'any enclosed piece of land' and
acquired the new and special significance of tilled land, as in
the Latin 'ager', etc. Corn, furrow, bean, meal, ear of corn,
and the verb to mow also date back to this period of our
history.
And then the north-western stream again sub-divided;
andwe will follow first of all that branch ofit which dropped
away southward into the Balkan peninsula and the islands
of the Aegean. This time
it
is not a word, but a poet's
imagination which has fixed for us in a passage of consider-
able beauty the historic moment when this wave first lapped
the farther shore, the prophetic shock of contact between
Aryan settler and aborigine:
Then fly our greetings, fly our speech and smiles!
As some grave Tyrian trader, from the sea,
Descried at sunrise an emerging prow
Lifting the cool-haired creepers stealthily,
The fringes of a southward-facing brow
Among the Aegean isles;
And saw the merry Grecian coaster come,
Freighted with amber grapes, and Chian wine,
Green bursting figs, and tunnies steep d in brine;
And knew the intruders on his ancient home,
The young light-hearted Masters of the waves.
.
.
.
34

The Settlement ofEurope
These young, light-hearted masters were called Greeks,
or Hellenes; they migrated southwards in a series ofwaves,
the
first of which contained two
tribes known
as
the
Achaians and Danaans. We
still make use of some of the
experiences undergone by these and other Greek tribes, and
of the
characteristics which they developed,
in
order
to
express more exactly our own inner experiences. Through
the channel of words and myths which have come down
to
us from
that
time,
the
great
poet who
sang
to
the
Achaians and Danaans
of
the
exploits
of
their
ancestors
has
given
us many
metaphors
and
images—special
little
reservoirs of feeling which we could not have created for
ourselves.
Most
people,
for
instance,
like
to
be
called
Trojans; stentorian, pander, and hector are from the names
of characters in his poems, and nectar and ambrosial from
the food and drink consumed by
his gods.
Speech was
a
more
miraculous and
rhythmical
thing
to
the
Achaians
than it is to us today, and whether or no the Gaelic bard is
cognate with the Greek
'phrazein',
to
'speak', there
is no
doubt
that
'epos',
the
'word',
had
its
other meaning
of
'poem'. Long afterwards the adjective 'epikos' came to be
applied
especially
to
lofty compositions such
as those
of
the great poet himself.
Accordingly, in the European war
the special correspondent could often find no more vivid
expression for his sense of the vastness and grandeur of the
catastrophe he was recording than to call up by the word
epic vague memories of Homer's gods and heroes.
A single timid reference to 'awful signs', 1 together with
the absence of any ordinary word for 'writing', suggests
that Homer's Achaians did not know how to write, and
1 oij/xara Auypa.
35

The Settlement ofEurope
that his two long poems of twenty-four books each had to
be memorized from beginning to end by that class ofpro-
fessional reciters from which our word rhapsody is derived.
The actual text of the Iliad and Odyssey gives us a vivid and
majestic picture ofearly, but not the earliest, Aryan culture.
Of their author, in so far as there was one particular author,
we know very litde except that he was probably blind. It
was the common thing for the bards who were to be found
among all the Aryan races, and survived as
' Minstrels ' into
the Middle Ages, to be blind; and Homer's own blindness,
apart from a reference to it, has been deduced by some from
a preponderance in his poems of *audile' epithets, such as
the clanging arrow and the loud-sounding sea. It may be men-
tioned that the Slavs once called their bards
'sliepac', a
word which also meant 'blind*.
The Dorians settled in Laconia in the southern part of
the Peloponnese or, as
it
is now called, the Motean penin-
sula.
The notorious taciturnity of the inhabitants of La-
conia has given us laconic, and we are referring to their rigid
ideas on infant welfare when we speak of a 'spartan mother',
for Sparta was the capital of Laconia.
Attica, for a time the home of the Ionians (who event-
ually crossed the Aegean to Asia Minor), has a more com-
plex
history; and
it was
in
Attica,
in the
sixth and
fifth
centuries
B.C.,
that the Hellenic culture reached
its
finest
flower. We use the word Attic
]
to describe
a peculiarly
finished work of art or an exquisite literary style. No won-
der.
In the city state of Athens, for the
first time among
the Aryans, there began to grow up something which an
1 The modern sense of 'a small room at the top of the house' goes back to
the time when Attic was also used ofarchitectural refinements, especially that
which is achieved by placing a smaller order above a larger one.
36

The Settlement ofEurope
educated man of today would be willing to recognize as a
civilization. In that clear air of a marvellous political free-
dom—a
social atmosphere which could
hardly have con-
densed from any but Aryan moral ideas—the matured, age-
old wisdom of Egypt and the East was absorbed by these
youngsters and transformed in a few hundred years into a
science, an art, and a philosophy of their own which have
never been wholly surpassed.
Consequently, the names of
many things which we regard as the very hall-marks of a
cultured society can be traced back to the Attic dialect of
this
period.
Academy,
school,
history,
logic,
grammar,
poetry,
rhythm,
harmony,
melody,
music,
are
all
from
Greek works which were in common use in Athens, and
the
lasting influence
of her sublime dramatic
tradition
is
indicated by the great words, chorus, comedy , drama, the-
atre, and tragedy, and the
lesser catastrophe, episode, pro-
logue, and protagonist,
all of which draw
their meanings
from the inspiration of the great Athenian dramatists.
Meanwhile another branch of the Aryan family had
found its way into Italy, and there, in the eighth century
before our era, had founded the city of Rome. It is notice-
able that the pitch darkness in which the early doings of all
the Aryans are lost often seems to flash into a spark ofmyth
or legend at those moments when they come into contact
with other races. It isjust such a spark which, in the story of
the rape of the Sabine women, perhaps lights up for us one
of the
early shocks
of encounter between
Italiot Aryans
and the older inhabitants of Italy.
Most people know a
little about the subsequent history
of these Italiots. The republic which they eventually estab-
lished
at Rome transformed
itself into an empire that ex-
31

The Settlement ofEurope
tended
its bounds
until they were coterminous with the
civilized world—an
empire
of Europe
and
part
of
Asia
which retained
its real authority oven men's persons until
the
fifth century
a.d., and
its
authority,
as an
idea, over
their minds and actions down to that day at the beginning
of
the
last century when
Bonaparte
first
styled
himself
'Emperor of the French'. There is, in fact, scarcely a word
in our language
expressing even remotely
the
notion
of
'authority', which
does not come
to
us from
the
Latin:
authority,
chief,
command,
control,
dictator,
dominion,
empire,
government,
master,
officer,
rule,
subordinate,
are
some
of
them;
and
it
is
significant
that
the
two
Greek words which we use
to express the same idea
are
despot and tyrant. Both these terms have a definite stigma
attaching to them, and are employed very much more often
by the foes of authority than by her friends. The Greeks
were not the nation to
establish a world-empire. They
would have combined to bury Caesar, not to praise him;
and from another point of view the odious sybarite is good
proof that they were not the stuff of which colonists are
made. The English lord and king, on the other hand, retain
about them a hint of the possibility of affection. It is a mark
of affection when sailors drop the Latin captain and adopt
the Dutch skipper, and the substitution by landsmen of Old
High German boss for Latin manager seems to have begun
in the same way. 1 And lastly, when we wish to suggest a
peculiar blend ofdignity and chill self-consciousness, we use
1 Note, however, that the tendency is now the other way and, with the
growth of twentieth-century class-consciousness, manager and managerial are
used where the intention
is to express the bare fact of authority without
innuendo, while boss and bosses are pejorative.
38

The Settlement ofEurope
the name of the most
remarkable of
all
the Roman
emperors.
Rome not only extended herjurisdiction over all Europe;
she was responsible for the birth of a new idea in men's
minds—the idea
that
'authority',
as
such, based on an
abstraction called 'law' and irrespective of real ties ofblood
or
affection, of sympathy or
antipathy, of religion
or
ownership, can exist as a relation between human beings.
But we have hurried on to the Empire and left out the
Republic. What were the beginnings and early occupations
of this astonishing
race, of whose national hero we are
reminded when we use the word
brute} In the previous
chapter reference was made to certain words and phrases
which are now used for the purposes of everyday life, but
which were originally technical metaphors drawn from the
phenomena of electricity. If we examine such words
as
calamity,
delirious, emolument, pecuniary, prevaricate,
tribula-
tion, we
shall
find
that
they
possess
a
similar
history.
Although
the Romans of classical times used the Latin
words from which they are derived in much the same way
as the English words are used now, yet if we trace them a
little farther back, we learn that 'delirare' had at one time
no other meaning than to 'go out of the furrow', when
ploughing; 'praevaricari' was to 'plough in crooked lines';
'tribulare'
to thrash with a 'tribulum', and so forth. In
interval, on the other hand (from 'intervallum', the space
between two palisades),
excel, premium, salary, and many
other words we have examples of metaphors taken from
the military life. The English-sounding word, spoil, comes
to us from a Latin term which once had no other meaning
than to
'strip a conquered foe of his arms'. By entering
39

The Settlement ofEurope
with our imaginations into the biography of such a word,
we
catch
glimpses of
civilization
in
primitive Rome.
Agriculture and war, we feel, were the primary businesses
of life, and it was to these that the Roman mind instinc-
tively flew when it was casting about for some means of
expressing a new abstract idea—ofrealizing the unknown in
terms of the known. Not often could the warlike
city
afford to beat her swords into ploughshares, but she was
constantly melting both implements into ideas.
Wherever we turn in our language, we have only to
scratch the surface in order to come upon fresh traces of
Rome and of her solid achievements in the world. With
Greece, however, it is different. It was not the outer fabric
of a future European civilization which the Greeks were
building up while their own civilization flourished, but the
shadowy, inner world of human consciousness. They were
helping to create our 'outlook'. We shall see a little later
how the language which is used by the theologians, philo-
sophers, and scientists of Europe was the gradual and pain-
ful creation of the thinkers of ancient Greece; and we shall
see that, without that language, the thoughts and feelings
and impulses which
it
expresses
could have no
being.
Rome's task was to erect across Europe a rigid and durable
framework on which the complicated texture of thought,
feeling, and will, woven in the looms of Athens and Alex-
andria, could be permanently outspread. Yet the perform-
ance of this task, concrete as it was, was inseparably con-
nected with an event of tremendous import for that grow-
ing, inner world to which we have already referred—the
most significant event, as many believe, in the history of
mankind.
40

The Settlement ofEurope
The
first
casual
contact between Greek
coaster and
Semitic trader, imaginatively portrayed in the stanza quoted
above from Matthew Arnold, was indeed prophetic.
It
proved afterwards to have been not merely a memorable
event, but a sort of fertilization of the whole history of
humanity. For to one Semitic tribe the passionate inner
world of its thoughts and feelings had remained almost
more real than the outward one of matter and energy. The
language of the Old Testament is alone enough to tell us
that, while the Greek Aryans had been pouring their vigour
into the creation of intellectual wisdom and liberty, the
Hebrews had been building up within themselves an extra-
ordinary moral and emotional
life,
as narrow
as
it was
intense. The two streams of evolution, stronger for having
been kept apart, were destined to meet and intermingle. In
332 B.C., when Alexander the Great sacked Sidon and Tyre,
Greeks and Hebrews began for the first time to live side by
side. They did not intermarry, but subtle influences must
have passed from one
to
the
other,
for in Alexandria,
shortly afterwards, contact between the two grew so inti-
mate that by the second century B.C. Greek had become the
official language of the Hebrew
Scriptures. In the same
century a Roman Protectorate was established over Syria,
which in course of time became
a province of the Roman
Empire.
In that province was born the individual who
is
known to history as Jesus of Nazareth.
His
teaching,
as
far
as
it has come down to
us, was
Semitic both in
its form and in
its outlook on the past.
Nevertheless, it was His teaching, and the feelings and im-
pulses (though in a somewhat unrecognizable form) which
He implanted in the hearts and wills of men, which were
4'

The Settlement ofEurope
spread by the organization of the Roman Empire all over
Europe; and it was, above all, that part of the Greek world of
thought which had crystallized round His teaching that was
carried over into the thought and feeling ofmodern Europe.
But
all this could only happen very slowly; for while
Greece and Rome had been rising successively to pinnacles
of civilization,
the
rest of the north-western group of
Aryans had remained plunged in darkness. They had passed
Italy by, and already, more than a thousand years
B.C.,
begun
to spread themselves over the
rest of Europe and
to
develop
in
the
different
areas wherein they found
a
resting-place the distinctive characteristics of Teuton, Slav,
and
Celt. The
Slavs, although they occupied—and
still
occupy—the whole vast east of Europe, and although they
number something like two hundred million souls, have as
yet had extraordinarily little influence upon our national
life. There are only two adopted Slavonic words which
may be described as common in all our language, trumpet
and slave, and both have come to us by devious routes, the
first through German and
French,
the second through
Greek and
Latin. One of the
lesser
Slavonic
races,
the
Croatians, developed a kind ofneckwear which appealed to
the fashionable French, who adopted it and described it as
'croate', 'crovate', or 'cravate', from which we get our
cravat. Otherwise the words are mostly exotic both in sound
and meaning. Thus, those
that come
to
us
direct from
Russia are copek, drosky, knout, rouble, samovar, steppe, verst
—all of which, with the possible exception of steppe, are
still only used when we are speaking of life in Russia itself. 1
1 The reader will readily add, for himself, those which have been coming
into use since this book was written.
42

The Settlement ofEurope
How different it is when we come to consider the Teu-
tons! When we have abstracted
all the Latin words, the
French words, the Celtic words, etc., from our vocabulary,
the 'English' words which remain are all Teutonic; for we,
ourselves, are a branch of the Teutonic race. 1 Accordingly
some of our older and most English words contain buried
vestiges of the lives which our ancestors once lived in the
continental forests. Fear, which
is thought to be derived
from the same word as fare, has been taken to suggest the
dangers, and weary, which is traced to an old verb meaning
'to tramp over wet ground', the fatigues of early travel,
while learn goes back to a root which meant 'to follow a
track'. As the Italiot Aryans, the Romans, created and ex-
tended their empire, they came into contact with these bar-
baric
Teutonic
tribes, whom
they
regarded,
naturally
enough, not as kinsmen, but as strangers. We find some of
the results of this contact in such words as inch, kitchen, mile,
mill, pound, street, toll, wall, and table—all ofwhich are Latin
words borrowed by our ancestors while they were
still
living on the Continent together with the ancestors of the
Scandinavian, Dutch, German, Austrian, and Swiss nations.
By their nature these words suggest civilizing influences,
and we find in their company the names of more portable
articles, such as
chest,
dish,
kettle, pillow, and wine, which
traders might have brought with them on their beasts of
burden. This hypothesis becomes almost a certainty when
it is seen that mule and ass were borrowed from Latin at this
1 But with a good deal of the Celt in us. There is no exact correspondence
between language and blood, the one being a measure of an intellectual, the
other of a more directly spiritual heritage. Cf. the influence of the Celts upon
the meanings ofRomance words, pp. 40-1, 89-90, 118, 200.

ruption of 'mango', the Latin name for a trader; and that

still keep in

. goes
back
to
'caupones',
the
Roman name for wine-dealers. A few words like pepper
even seem to have come in at this time from the remote
East, by way of Rome, and altogether these old Teutonic
words may indeed give us, as Mr. Pearsall Smith has said,
'a dim picture of Roman traders,
travelling with
their
mules and asses along the paved roads of the German pro-
vinces,
their chests and boxes and wine-sacks, and their
profitable bargains with our primitive ancestors'. Finally,
the military words camp and pile recall the heyday of the
Empire, when Rome would recruit vast armies from her
provincial subjects, and the -Chester, which terminates the
names of many English towns,
is of course Latin castra, a
camp.
Even church
(another word common
to
all
the
Teutonic
languages)
may
have
been
brought home by
German mercenaries on
service
in the
East.
The Greek
'Kuriakon', from which
it
is said to be derived, was in use
in the Eastern provinces, as opposed to the 'ekklesia' (French
'eglise', Italian 'chiesa' and ecclesiastical) adopted by Latin
Christianity, and our pagan forefathers probably picked
it
up accidentally while they were pillaging the sacred build-
ings in which their posterity was to kneel.
The modern nations of Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
Holland,
England, Germany,
Austria,
and
Switzerland
cover most of the area over which the Teutonic immi-
grants originally spread. In a good many cases they found
Celtic predecessors already in possession. These Celts had
been the first Aryans to arrive in Northern Europe, and
44

The Settlement ofEurope
they seem, at one time, to have spread over most of the
Continent. Later on, in historical times, they were to be
found
chiefly throughout
that wide
district—including
most of modern France and
a great part of Spain and
Portugal—which the Romans called 'Gaul', as well as all
over Great Britain and Ireland. In Spain and France they
mingled their blood extensively with that ofthe Italiots, the
two together becoming the ancestors of the present 'Latin'
races or speakers of the 'Romance' 1 languages. But already,
long before the decline of the Roman Empire, the Teutons
were beginning to drive the Celts westward and away, a
process which is clearly marked in these islands by the pre-
valence of Celtic place-names in the west country. Thus,
the percentage of Celtic place-names in Cornwall has been
calculated to be about 80; in Devon it
is only 32, and in
Suffolk 2. The conflict between Celt and Teuton dragged
on in Ireland until 1921, and
it
is doubtful if it
is quite
finished yet. One contingent ofthe old Celtic inhabitants of
this island, or Britons, driven to the tip ofCornwall, decided
to leave these shores altogether. They sailed back to the
Continent,
and there
established themselves in the
sea-
board district which
still bears the name of Brittany.
It
is
said that a Welsh peasant and a Breton can still, to this day,
understand one another's speech well enough
for most
practical purposes.
The number of proved Celtic words which have found
their way
into
English
is
extraordinarily
small—scarce
1 Students of the Wordsworthian theory of poetic diction will be inter-
ested to learn that the origin of this curious woed
is believed to be a Late
Latin phrase, 'romanice loqui', meaning 'to speak the vulgar Latin of every-
day life, as distinguished from book-Latin'.
45

The Settlement ofEurope
above a dozen. Bard, bog, and glen are among those which
have come to us direct, and car had to travel through Latin
and French before it reached us, the original having been
borrowed by Julius Caesar from the Gauls, who had thus
named their war chariots. But for the most part,
Celtic
words like banshee, eisteddfod, galore, mavourneen,
.
.
. have a
remote and foreign look, even though we may have used
them for many years. When we
reflect that the Welsh
tongue is still spoken within two hundred miles ofLondon,
and that another Celtic language, the Cornish, has onlyjust
died out, this seems very difficult to understand.
Such, then, in barest outline, was the distribution of the
Aryan races which formed the major part ofthat vague and
loose-knit organization, the later Roman Empire. But it
must not be imagined that this picture of Rome's European
subjects
is anything like complete. Evoking history from
words
is
like
looking
back
at our own
past
through
memory; we see it, as it were, from within. Something has
stimulated the memory—a smell, a taste, or a fragment of
melody—and an inner light is kindled, but we cannot tell
how far that light will throw its beams. Language, like the
memory, is not an automatic diary; and it selects incidents
for preservation, not so much according to their intrinsic
significance as according to the impression they happen to
have made upon the national consciousness.
Thus, English words have little to tell us about the great
migrations and massacres in Europe during the
first ten
centuries of the Christian era, for terms of abuse like vandal
and hun draw their emotional force from the imaginations
of historians rather than from actual contact with the tribes
46

The Settlement ofEurope
in question. 1 From a mathematically impartial point of
view,
therefore, the small amount of space that can be
assigned here to events which absorbed such an enormous
share oftime and energy and swallowed millions ofhuman
lives is indeed misleading. There is, however, an interesting
little group ofwords still bearing the imprint of the mighty
upheaval which took
place around
the Mediterranean
during the seventh and eighth centuries a.d., when Moham-
medan Arabs overran Persia, Syria, Egypt, North Africa,
Spain, and the south of France. As might be expected, these
words come to us mostly from Arabic, via Spanish and
French, for it was in Spain that Islam took her firmest hold
on Europe. They include
cotton, gazelle,
giraffe,
lacquey,
masquerade, syrup,
tabby
(originally a kind of silk),
tabor,
talc, tambourine, and some very interesting technical terms
to which we shall presently return. Naturally the receding
tide ofinvasion has left Arabic place-names dotted about in
all the countries mentioned, while Spain herselfis crammed
with them; but to give examples would be beyond the
scope of this little volume, which now finds itselfdrawn by
the laws of its subject-matter to hover more closely about
the shores ofthese islands.
1 Bigot, which is found in French as early as the twelfth century, has been
connected with Visigoth, but this derivation is not regarded as probable.

There could hardly be a better example of the un-
easy movement of Aryan migrations than the his-
tory of the settlement of the British Isles. We find
them, first of all, as far back as we can look, inhabited by an
unknown population who
left their barrows and tumuli
dotted about the country, whose society seems to have
been matriarchally organized, and who, if the name Pict
may be taken as any indication, probably had the habit of
painting or tattooing their bodies. At length, several cen-
turies before our era, the
first Aryan wave reaches these
shores in the persons ofthe Celts, who spread over England,
Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, where they have been pointed
out and variously described by historians, as Britons, Ancient
Britons, Welsh, Gaels, Celts,
.
.
. They settle down and live
for some centuries the kind of life which we describe as
primitive,
till half-way through the first century B.C. they
are disturbed by a
little Aryan tongue reaching out from

England before the Reformation
the wellnigh spent Italian wave. Pagan Rome establishes a
brief dominion over
a small portion of Britain,
drives
roads, builds camps and cities, and after some four hundred-
years is sucked back again to the Continent. Another cen-
tury, and the Angles and Saxons, borne forward on the
crest of the Teutonic wave, overrun the main island, driv-
ing the Celts into its extremities, whence they regurgitate,
before finally
settling down, upon various military and
missionary
enterprises which have played an important
part in our history. But already another ripple of the Teu-
tonic wave
is upon us, rocking over the seas in the long
boats of the Scandinavian Vikings, and almost before they
have left their impress on the eastern quarter of the land, a
third—the Normans this time—is breaking on Britain once
again at Pevensey. The liquid metaphor is unavoidable, for
no other image seems adequate to express what actually
happened. To watch through the
glasses of history the
gradual arrival and settlement of the Aryans in this country
is to be reminded irresistibly of the rhythmic wash and
backwash,
the
little
accidental
interplays of plash and
ripple, which accompany the tide as
it
fills an irregularly
shaped pool.
Every one of these motions has left its mark on our lan-
guage, though the traces of the earliest immigration of all
—that of the Celts—are rather scarce. The clearest vestiges
of it are to be found in the proper names ofour rivers, for a
surprising number of these contain one or other of the
various Celtic terms for 'water' or 'river', e.g. avon, dwr
iter or der), uisge (wye, usk,
is, ax), while the other parts of
the name are often composed of words for 'water' taken
from another Aryan language, as in Derwentwater, Winder-
49

England before the Reformation
mere,
Easeburn,
Ashbourne.
.
.
. An
ingenious
theory
has
been evolved to account for this. In the case of the Dur-beck
in Nottinghamshire, and the Dur-bach in Germany,
it has
been supposed that in the first place a body of Celtic immi-
grants squatted by the side of a stream which, as they were
not extensive
travellers, they knew simply
as the dwr—
'The Water'. Their Teutonic successors inquired the name
of the stream, and on learning that
it was dwr, naturally
assumed that this was a proper name. They accordingly
adopted
it, and tacked on one of their own words for
'water'—'bach' or 'beck', just as we may speak of the
'Avon
River'
or the
'River
Ouse'. The phenomenon
occurs so
persistently both in
this country and
all over
Europe
that
this
explanation can hardly be
altogether
fanciful.
The four hundred years of Roman colonization, follow-
ing Julius Caesar's landing in 55 B.C.—years which left such
permanent and conspicuous vestiges on the face ofEngland
—have made
little enough impression on her language.
Recent as the memory of that civilization must have been
when the Angles and Saxons arrived, they seem to have
learnt nothing from it. A few towns, such as York (Ebor-
acum), retain in a more or less corrupted form the parti-
cular
titles given to them by their Roman founders, but
outside these almost the only Latin words which we seem
to owe to the Romanizing of Britain are port and the form
of
'castra'
(a camp),
already referred
to, which survives
today in Chester and
in the ending of many other town
names such as Winchester, Lancaster, Gloucester.
.
.
.
Then, during the fifth and sixth centuries of our era, the
Angles and Saxons began to flow in from the Continent,
So

England before the Reformation
bringing with them old Aryan words like dew, night, star,
and wind, which they had never forgotten, new words
which they had coined or developed in their wanderings,
and Latin words which they had learnt as provincial sub-
jects of the Roman Empire, 1 bringing, in fact, that peculiar
Teutonic variant of the Aryan tongue which forms the rich
nucleus of our English vocabulary. Their arrival here was
followed almost immediately by their conversion to Christ-
ianity; and this moment in our history was a pregnant one
for the future of Europe. For now the two great streams of
humanity—Teutonic blood from the one side, and from
the other the old classical civilization, bearing in
its dark
womb the strange, new Christian impulse—met. The Latin
and Greek words which entered our language at this period
are concerned for the most part with the dogma and ritual
of the Church; such are
altar,
candle,
clerk,
creed,
deacon,
hymn, martyr, mass, nun, priest, psalm, shrine, stole, temple, and
many others. Far more important was the alteration which
now gradually took place in the meanings of many old
Teutonic words—words like heaven, which had hitherto
denoted a 'canopy', or bless, which had meant to 'conse-
crate with blood'. But to this we must return later, when
we come to consider what is called the
' semantic' history of
English words—that is to say, the history of their meanings.
Although
Christianity
did
not come
officially from
Rome to England until Augustine landed in a.d. 597,
it
had
already found
its way
here
indirectly
during

occupation.

Saxons,

England before the Reformation
been the work of Celtic Christians, who returned from
Ireland and established missionary bases in Scotland and
Northumbria. Their influence was so extensive that
' Scotia',
the old name for Ireland, came to be applied to the country
which we still know as Scotland. Pat and Taffy, the popular
nicknames for an Irishman and a Welshman, are descended
from the Celtic saints, Patrick and David, and it is interest-
ing to reflect that the Celtic missionaries were starting their
work in Northumbria at almost exactly the same moment
as Saint Augustine landed in Kent. Thus Christianity en-
filaded England, as it were, from both ends; and while the
southern Anglo-Saxons were learning the Greek and Latin
words to which we have referred, the Irish Christians in the
north had been making the language a present of a few
Celtic words, two of which
druid and lough—have sur-
vived. Again, although the name for the instrument of the
Passion comes to us ultimately from the Latin 'crux', yet
the actual form which the word
cross has taken in our
language is very largely due to these Irish Christians. But
for them it would probably have been something like cruke,
or cruce, or crose. This word has an interesting history.
It
was adopted from the old Irish 'cros' by the Northmen,
and it is due to them that the final V took on that hissing
sound which is represented in modern spelling by 'ss\ We
may suppose, therefore, that but for the Irish Christians the
word would have been something like cruce, and but for the
Northmen it might have been croz or croy.
In the ninth and tenth centuries these Northmen, the
Scandinavian Teutons, whom our ancestors called Danes,
established an ascendancy over a large part of England.
They seem to have mingled easily with the English, and we
52

England before the Reformation
can trace back to their dialect some of the very commonest
features ofour language. Thus, the Scandinavian pronouns,
they,
them,
their,
she,
gradually replaced
less convenient
Anglo-Saxon forms, and it is to the Northmen that we owe
that extremely useful grammatical achievement which has
enabled us
to form both the genitive and the plural of
nearly
all nouns by merely adding the letter V. Other
Scandinavian words are call, get, hit, husband, knife, leg, odd,
same, skin, take, want, wrong; and there are many more hardly
less common. The mighty word law, together with outlaw,
hustings, wapentake, moot, and riding (division of Yorkshire)
serve to remind us
that the Danish ascendancy was no
hugger-mugger
affair, but a firm
political organization.
The old Anglo-Saxon words which these Northern in-
truders replaced, such as niman,
'to take', and Rood (the
Cross) have mostly fallen out of use; but in some cases the
two words survive side by side. Thus, our useful distinction
between law and right was once geographical rather than
semantic, the two words covering roughly the eastern and
the western halves of England. Appropriately enough, it is
a distinction which is much less clear in the German, and
perhaps in other European languages than it is in our own.
'Recht',
for example, covers 130th law and right in some
contexts where we are obliged to choose one word or the
other. The course of events, and the genius of the English
language, seem together to have taken early cognizance of
the fact that a separate name would be required for the
thing peculiar to those who speak it, namely a rule of con-
duct which is enforceable by the Courts before it has been
enacted by the legislature—a common or 'unwritten' law.
And now there followed an event which has had more
53

England before the Reformation
influence on the character of the English language than any
other before or
since. The conquest of England by the
Norman 1
invaders brought
about an
influx of French
words which went on increasing in volume for more than
three centuries. At first it was little more than a trickle. For
a long time the Norman conquerors did not mix much
with their Saxon subjects. There are plenty ofindications of
this; for the languages, too, moved side by side in parallel
channels. The custom of having one name for a live beast
grazing in the field and another for the same beast, when it
is killed and cooked,
is often supposed to be due to our
English squeamishness and hypocrisy. Whether or no the
survival of this custom through ten centuries is due to the
national characteristics in question it would be hard to say,
but they have certainly nothing to do with its origin. That
is a much more blameless
affair. For the Saxon neatherd
who had spent a hard day tending his oxen, sheep, calves,
and swine, probably saw little enough of the beef, mutton,
veal, pork, and bacon, which were gobbled at night by his
Norman masters. There is something a little pathetic, too,
in the thought that the homely old word, stool, could be
used to express any kind of seat, however magnificent,
until
it was, so to speak, hustled into the kitchen by the
smart French chair. Even the polite, however, continued to
use the old word in the idiom 'to fall between two stools'.
Master,
servant,
butler,
buttery, parlour,
dinner, supper, and
banquet all came over with William, besides the names of
our titular ranks, such as duke, marquis, viscount, baron, and
1 These Normans, or North-men, were the
descendants of a Teutonic
Danish tribe, which had taken possession ofNormandy about a hundred and
fifty years before.
54

England before the Reformation
countess. The French word 'comte' was evidently con-
sidered to be equivalent to the one existing Anglo-Saxon
title, earl, with the result that count never became an English
rank. But since it had not been the Saxon custom to give
ladies titles corresponding to those of their lords, the word
countess was able to fill an important gap. That the Feudal
System had an educative value and played its part in creat-
ing modern ideals ofconduct is suggested by such words as
honest, kind, and gentle, which meant at first simply 'ofgood
birth or position' and only acquired during the Middle
Ages their later and lovelier meanings.
Not the least interesting of the words that must have
come over from France about this time are such courtly
flower-names as dandelion and pansy, from
' dent-de-lion
(describing the ragged leaves) and the sentimental 'pensee'
—remembrance. Many of these early Norman words seem
to have a distinctive character of their own, and even now,
after nearly a thousand years, they will sometimes stand out
from the printed page with peculiar appeal. Perhaps this is
especially true of the military vocabulary. That sharp little
brightness, as of a window-pane flashing just after sunset,
which belongs to the ancient, technical language of heral-
dry, such as argent, azure, gules,
.
.
. sometimes seems to have
spread to more common Norman words
banner, hauberk,
lance, pennon,
.
.
. and—in the right mood—we can even
catch a gleam ofit in everyday terms like arms, assault, battle,
fortress, harness, siege, standard, tower, and war. The Norman-
French etymology of curfew (couvre-feu) is too well known
to require comment.
It will be noticed that nearly all these words are directly
descended from the Latin, beef going back through 'boeuf
55

England before the Reformation
to 'bov-em', master to 'magister', duke to 'dux',
.
.
. Thus
already, by the thirteenth century, we can trace in our
vocabulary four distinct layers of Latin words. There are
the Latin words learnt by our ancestors while they were
still on the Continent, such as camp, mile, and street; 1 there
are the Latin words brought over by the Roman invaders,
ofwhich port and Chester were given as surviving examples;
and thirdly there are those words
altar,
candle, nun,
.
.
.
brought over by the
Christian missionaries
as described
earlier in this chapter. These three classes are reckoned to
account for about four hundred Latin words altogether;
and lastly there
is
this great deposit of Norman-French
words, ofwhich the number must have been running into
thousands. For
it was not only terms of general
utility
which were transferred from one language to another. A
second and
entirely
different
kind of borrowing now
sprang up—the literary kind. For two or three centuries
Poetry and Romance had been making rapid
strides in
Italy and France. The medieval habit of writing only in
Latin was dying out and Dante in Italy and Du Bellay in
France had both written treatises extolling the beauties of
their native tongues. French lyric poetry burst into its early
spring blossom among the troubadours, with their curious
'Rose'
tradition, and for two hundred years the English
poets imitated and translated them as fast as ever they could.
It was just at the end of this long period of receptiveness
that an event occurred which fixed the ingredients of our
language in a way they had never been fixed before. The
printing press was invented.
A modern poet, looking back on that time, can scarcely
1 See p. 40.
56

England before the Reformation
help envying a writer like Chaucer with
this enormous
store of fresh, unspoilt English words ready to his hand and
an unlimited treasury across the channel from which he
could pick a brand-new one whenever he wanted it.
Thou hast deserved sorerfor to smart,
But pitee renneth soone in gentil heart.
Here
are
three Norman French borrowings,
three
fine
English words with the dew still on them, in two lines. It
was the May morning ofEnglish poesy.
For these were not 'French' words. Right at the begin-
ning of the thirteenth century the English kings had aban-
doned Normandy, and the English Normans,
separated
from their brethren, began to blend more and more closely
with their neighbours. In England French remained at first
the exclusive language of the Court and the law, but, as the
blood of the two peoples mingled,
the Norman words
which were not dropped gradually altered their shapes,
developing various English characteristics, which not only
differentiated from their original French forms the words
already in the language, but served as permanent moulds
into which new borrowings could be poured as they were
made. Gentil changed to gentle, pitee to pitie or pity; and it
was the same with innumerable others. Familiar French-
English terminations like -Hon,
-ty, -age, -able, -on, were
already nearly as common in Chaucer as they are in the
pages of an average modern writer. Begotten on Latin
words by
generations
of happy-go-lucky
French
and
English lips, they were fixed for ever by the printing press,
and today, if we want to borrow a word directly from
Latin, we still give it a shape which tacitly assumes that it
51

England before the Reformation
came to us through the French language at about that time.
As Nature takes the human embryo through repetitions of
its discarded forms—fish, reptile, mammal, and vertebrate
—before bringing it to birth, so whoever introduced, let us
say,
the word
heredity
in
the nineteenth century went
through the instinctive process of deriving from the Latin
'hereditare' an imaginary French word,
'heredite', and
converting the latter into heredity.
It is usually done when
we wish to borrow a new word from Latin.
We have borrowed so many that it has lately been calcu-
lated that as many as one-fourth of the words which we
can find in a full-sized Latin dictionary have found then-
way directly or indirectly into the English vocabulary. A
large number of these are Greek words which the Romans
had taken from them. Thus,
taking into account those
Greek words which have come to us by other channels,
Greek and Latin form a very large and a very important
part of the English language. All through the history ofour
nation the two threads can be seen running together. At
first sight they appear to be so inextricably twisted round
one another as to form but one solid cord, but in reality it is
not so difficult to unravel them. The fact, for instance, that
hospital and prison are Latin, while church and school have
only come through Latin from the Greek,
is typical of the
two main
divisions
into which
the
classical
part
of our
language
falls;
for words which
are
genuinely
of
Latin
origin—unless they have been especially used at some time
to translate the thoughts of Greek writers—are very often
concerned with
the
material
outer
world,
but words
of
Greek origin are more likely to be landmarks in the world
of thoughts and feelings.
58

England before the Reformation
Rome had
spent herself in building up the
external,
visible framework on which European civilization was to
hang; and this
fact, observable in the word-relics of her
military and political exploits, is observable still more inti-
mately in the character and history of that great institution,
our common law. Dignified vocables likejustice,jurisdiction,
jurisprudence, speak for themselves the lasting influence of
the great Roman conception of 'jus'—that abstract ideal of
the relation between one free human being and another in
so far as it is expressed in their actions. It is not that in any
sense we took over the Roman system; lawyers as well as
poets are keen to insist that we built up our own. But as
freedom slowly broadened down from precedent to prece-
dent, there was always before the early English kings and
judges a sort of pattern—more than that, a vital principle
which had outlived one body and was waiting to be clothed
with another. It was the spirit of Roman law living on in
her language.
A whole chapter might be written on the numerous
English words whose meanings can be traced back to the
usages of Roman law. Take, for instance, the word person.
Derived, probably, from an Etruscan word meaning an
actor's mask, 'persona' was used by the Roman legislators to
describe a man's personal rights and duties, which were
defined according to his position in life. Its present meaning
of an individual human being is largely due to the theolo-
gians who hit upon it when they were looking for some
term
that would
enable them
to
assert
the
trinity
of
Godhead without admitting more than one 'substance'.
When we remember
for how long
a time Latin con-
tinued to be the universal written language of educated
59

England before the Reformation
Europe, 1 the language of history and philosophy as well as of
theology, we can imagine how the subtle flavour of this
word's former meaning clung to its syllables through all their
ecclesiastical soarings and was ready, as soon as it came to
English earth, to
assist the brains of our early lawyers in
their task of imagining and thus creating that perhaps for-
tunate legal abstraction, the British subject. 'Obligatio' in
early Latin meant merely the physical binding of someone
to something; but in the Roman law of that date a default-
ing debtor was literally bound and delivered a prisoner into
the hands of his creditor. Thus, when a little later on this
crude practice was abandoned, 'obligatio' came to mean
the duty to pay—a duty which the creditor could now only
enforce against his debtor's property; and in this way the
general meaning of our word
obligation was developed.
Similarly
retaliation
came
to
us
from
the
Latin
'Lex
Talionis', the latter word being associated with 'talis' (such
or same) and implying a punishment that
fits the crime;
while advocate, capital, 2 chattel, 2 classical, contract, emancipate,
formula,
heir, peculiar, prejudice, private, property, and
testa-
ment are a few more examples of the same process, chosen
from a great many.
Naturally many of these words came into the English
language just
after the Conquest. The French, being
so
much nearer to Rome, both in blood and in space, were a
1 At least down to the fourteenth century. Even in Milton's time it was the
language ofinternational scholarship.
2 Latin 'capitalis' from 'caput'—a head, and thus 'the status of Roman
citizenship'. Under the old Roman law each citizen was assessed according to
the number of beasts which he possessed. Thus, the word cattle is also derived,
through French, from 'capitalis'. Compare the derivation of pecuniary from
'pecus'—a head of cattle, and/ee from Old English 'feoh'
(cattle).
60

England before the Reformation
century or two ahead of the Teutons in their civilization,
and the Normans, after their long sojourn on the Conti-
nent, brought with them to England quite a complicated
system oflegislature and executive. Besides the Latin words
to which we have referred, there are a large number of
legal terms which are not so easily recognizable as Latin,
having passed through Late Latin, Low Latin, and Early
French colloquial speech before they reached our shores. In
some cases they only developed a specifically legal sense in
Late Latin or even Early French. Yet because the whole
spirit of Roman civilization had been so impregnated with
legalism, the capacity for expressing exact legal ideas seems
to have remained latent, through
all their curious vicissi-
tudes, in such words as assize
(literally 'a sitting down'),
court, judge, jury, county,
district,
manor,
rent,
.
.
. Lawyers
have gone on employing a queer kind of Anglo-French,
in some cases, right down to the present day. The official
use of 'Law French' in legal documents was only recently
abandoned, and such technical terms as champerty,feme sole,
tort, chose-in-action, cestui-que-trust,
.
.
. survive to remind us
of the days when an English-speaking lawyer would natur-
ally write such a sentence as:
Arsons de measons felonisement faits est felony per
le comen
ley. (Arson of houses committed with felonious intent
is
felony by the common law.) The profession still sometimes
refers affectionately to an old law-report, which mentions
that the prisoner at the bar jecta un
brickbat a le dit Justice,
que narrowly mist.
Convey, felon, forfeit, lease, mortgage, perjury, plaintiff and
defendant, on the other hand, have acquired a somewhat
more general use; and indeed this Frenchifiedjargon, partly
61

England before the Reformation
imported and partly built up by English lawyers as they
went
along,
has produced
in
later times
several words
which the language as a whole would find it hard to do
without. Among them are assets (French 'assez'), burglar,
cancel, conventional, disclaim, flotsam and jetsam, jettison, im-
prove, matter-of-fact, mere,
' the premises'', realize, size, and
in
its modern sense—franchise; while
culprit, which was
used in court down to the eighteenth century, has an inter-
esting history of its own. In former days, when the prisoner
had pleaded 'Not Guilty', the Clerk of the Crown would
open proceedings by saying 'Culpable:
prest', meaning
that the prisoner is
' guilty', and I am 'ready' to prove it. In
the official records of the case this formula was abbreviated,
first to 'cul-prest' and afterwards to 'cul-prit', until later
clerks formed the habit ofrunning the two words together.
Looking at such words as cancel, improve, realize, and size,
we can feel the force of Professor Maitland's remark that in
the Middle Ages 'Law was the point where life and logic
met'. It served another purpose besides that of establishing
a secure polity; for through it some ofthe new Latin words
which were gradually being created by its own, or trans-
lated from Greek, thought by the abstruse scholastic philo-
sophy of the day found their way into the vocabulary of the
people. Even the old word cause seems to have reached us by
way of the law courts. They were thus the pipe through
which a little ofthat hard tliinking by the few, which under-
pins every great civilization, could flow into the common
consciousness of the many, and in their terminology we
can see most clearly
an example of that never-pausing
process by which the speculative metaphysics of yesterday
are transformed into the 'common sense' of today.

The
English language has been facetiously described
as 'French badly pronounced'. At the death of
Chaucer, and for nearly a hundred years
after-
wards, tliis description would have been very nearly a true
one. Apart from the adoption ofa few Latin words, changes
seem to have been few and insignificant during the fifteenth
century, and we may assume that, for the first half of it at
any
rate,
the Hundred Years' War was occupying too
many of our
energies
to
leave much time
for
cultural
growth. Nevertheless, from developments such
as those
which have been pointed out in some ofour legal termino-
logy we can feel something of the way in which the genius
of the English language was steadily, if slowly, reasserting
itselfand claiming its right to a separate personality. At the
Reformation, when England finally shook herself free from
the dangerous embraces of the Holy Roman Empire, the
period of excessive French influence came to an end. The
general effect of Protestantism on our language, subtle and
profound as
it has been, will be dealt with later, but the
Reformation cannot be passed over here without recording
63

Modern England
one instance in which a word—perhaps a misunderstood
word—has had extraordinarily lasting results. It is the con-
fusion of the English Sunday with the Jewish Sabbath 1 and
the consequent fastening upon that day of rest of many of
the sombre inhibitions entailed by Sabbatic Law.
There is, however, another historical event which had a
far more universal and direct bearing on English words,
and that is the Revival of Learning. The new intercourse
with the ancient literatures of Greece and Rome naturally
brought into English a positive stream of 'literary borrow-
ings'. At first these were mostly Latin words. If we try to
imagine an English from which such words as accommodate,
capable,
capacious,
compute,
corroborate,
distinguish,
efficacy,
estimate, experiment, insinuate, investigate, and a host ofothers
equally common are as yet absent, we may partly realize
what an important part was played by the Renaissance in
producing
the language
in which we speak and
think.
There is indeed good evidence that the stream ofnew words
flowed too fast at this time for ordinary people to keep up
with
it. For instance, many of the Latin words that were
borrowed have since fallen out of use. At the beginning of
the seventeenth century Francis Bacon, who
is not a fan-
tastic
writer, was
using
such
unfamiliar
expressions
as
contentation,
contestation,
digladiation,
morigeration,
redar-
gution,
ventosity,
.
.
. and somewhat before
this, when the
Classical influx was at its height, it was conspicuous enough
to
call
forth
several amusing
parodies. We remember
Shakespeare's Holofernes in Love's Labour s Lost, and Sir
Thomas Wilson includes in his Arte ofRhetorike a fictitious
1 First found with the meaning of Sunday in an edict of the Long Parlia-
ment.
64

Modern England
letter applying for a church benefice, in which he satirizes
as follows the Klondyke rush after fashionable Latinity:
'Pondering,
expending,
and
revoluting with
myself,
your ingent affability, and ingenious capacity for mundane
affairs:
I cannot but celebrate and extoll your magnifical
dexterity above all other. For how could you have adepted
such illustrate prerogative, and domestical superiority, if
the fecundity of your ingeny had not been so fertile and
wonderful pregnant?
.
.
.'
Now this outcrop of linguistic parody is significant for
other reasons too. It reminds us that the English language
had
at
last become
'self-conscious'. In former times the
struggle between different ways of saying the same thing,
between the old and the new, the native and the foreign,
had generally worked itselfout under the surface, amid the
half-conscious preferences of the mass of the people. Thus,
the old English translators who rendered the Latin 'exodus'
as outfaring and 'discipulus'
(disciple) as learning-boy, were
not consciously trying to keep the Latin words out; nor did
the fourteenth-century author of a book, which he called
the Againbite of Intuit, have any academic horror, as far as
we know, of the new Latin borrowings remorse and con-
science, with one of which,
at
least, he must have been
familiar. The same may be said of Wyclif, who translated
'resurrectio'
againrising
and
'immortalitas'
undeadliness.
These old writers anglicized because
it came natural to
them to
anglicize, just
as the next generation began to
prefer the Latin words. But it was not so in Italy, nor in
France,
in both of which countries poets had long ago
written careful treatises on the beloved medium of their
art, their native language. And now, after the Revival of
65

Modern England
Learning, in England, too, scholars and literary men began
to notice such things. Counterbalancing the enthusiasm for
Latin and Greek, there arose a 'Purist' movement ofjust
the kind which has had such
a powerful
effect on the
development of modern German. People tried to expel all
'foreign' words from the language; Sir John Cheke began
a translation of the New Testament in which none but
native words were to be used; and we fmd in his Matthew
moond for lunatic, hundreder for centurion, frosent (from-sent)
for
apostle,
crossed for
crucified, freshman for proselyte, and
many other equally odd-sounding concoctions. To look
back
in
this way on
the
uncertainty and chaos which
reigned at the beginning of the seventeenth century is to
intensify our admiration
for the
scholarship and poetic
taste displayed by the devout compilers of the Authorised
Version.
If we were to look for another symptom of this some-
times pedantic self-consciousness, we could find
it in the
modernway ofspelling debt and doubt. The old orthography,
det and dout, is a perfectly correct English rendering of the
French words from which they are taken, but the scholars
of the Renaissance, anxious to show the ultimate derivation
from the Latin stems 'deb' and 'dub', inserted an entirely
unnecessary
' b ' into the words, and there it has stayed ever
since. Sometimes, too, these Elizabethan dons made learned
howlers,
as in the now abandoned
spelling abhominable,
which arose from a quite false idea that that adjective
is
derived from the Latin
' ab ' (from) and
' homo ' (man).
One can also get a curiously vivid sense of the way in
which new Latin words had been streaming into the lan-
guage during the sixteenth century from Bacon's literary
66

Modern England
style. He is so fond of placing a Latin and an English word
side by side, in order to express what is virtually a single
idea,
that two
consecutive pages of the Advancement of
Learning supply no
less than ten examples of this habit.
Among them are immoderate and overweening,
action and
business, charge and accusation, eloquence and speech. To under-
stand the exact effect which this kind of writing must have
had on the
ears of his contemporaries we must
try
to
realize the
faintly novel and
difficult sound with which
many of these Latin syllables would
still be ringing. No
such effort is required, however, to comprehend the way in
which
this
deliberate
duplication must have helped
to
familiarize English people with the sound and meaning of
the new words.
Very soon the Greek language too began to be drawn
upon, though never to quite the same extent as Latin. Thus,
English of the fifteenth century must also be thought of as
a language
in which hundreds of familiar words
like
apology, apostrophe, bucolic, climax, drama, emphasis, encyclo-
pedia, epidemic, epilogue, episode, hypothesis, hysterical, para-
graph, parallel, paraphrase, physical, do not yet
exist,
for
these are
all examples of words which came in with the
Renaissance. 1 The number of technical terms of art and
literature is particularly noticeable, and it was now that the
foundations were
laid of that almost automatic system
whereby a new Greek-English word is coined to mark each
1 Two of the words quoted
are
first found, according to
the Oxford
Dictionary, in Sir Thomas More, one (apostrophe) in the text and the other in
the title of his Apologie of Syr Thomas More, Knyght, 'made by him, after he
had geven over the Office of Lord Chancellor of Englande'.
It
is not sur-
prising that the creator of a European success like the word Utopia should
have had a fine taste in real Greek words too.

Modern England
advance that is made in science, and especially in technics.
Automatic is itself an example, and it is hardly necessary to
add chronometer, dynamo, magneto, metronome, telescope, theo-
dolite, thermometer,
.
.
.
But though the stern lovers of their native tongue were
thus hopelessly outclassed, yet the mere existence of the
conservative feeling which they tried to voice must have
acted as a useful brake on the too indiscriminate adoption of
new words. The English language was,
in
fact,
settling
down. It was in the future to receive countless additions
never to change
its very essence
as
it had done in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. And thus, as we look
on towards the modern period, we find only fewer and
more scattered historical vestiges. But if we can no longer
expect etymology to
tell us anything approaching to
a
complete and coherent tale,
it will nevertheless
still light
up for us from different angles different little portions of
that dark, mysterious mass, the past.
By the sixteenth century, for example,
that peculiarly
English characteristic, the love of sport, had already begun
to make its mark on the language. Sport itself is an abbrevi-
ation of 'disport', a French word meaning 'to carry oneself
in a different direction from that of one's ordinary busi-
ness'.
It is interesting to observe how both the form and
meaning of the English word have diverged from their
origin, and how they have since been reborrowed into
French and most of the other languages of Europe. Italian
tailors will even use the term to describe a roll ofloud check
cloth! Of the older sports, hawking has given us
allure,
haggard,
rebate, and
reclaim. The
Latin
'reclamare'
had
meant 'to cry out against' or 'to contradict'; it was only in
68

Modern England
hawking that it acquired its present sense of 'calling back'
from the cries that were uttered to summon the hawk back
to the wrist. Allure
is from the old
lure, an apparatus for
recalling the birds, and haggard is a word of obscure etymo-
logy which was used ofa wild hawk. Forte andfoible are old
fencing
terms,
describing
the
strong and weak
(feeble)
points of a sword.
Couple,
muse,
relay,
retrieve
(French
'retrouver'), run riot, ruse, sagacious, tryst, and worry we owe
to hunting, as also the development of the Latin 'sentire'
into the English word scent. Of these the most interesting
are perhaps muse, which is supposed to be derived from the
same word as muzzle, and ruse, another form of rush.The
hounds were said to 'muzzle' when they sniffed the air in
doubt about the scent, and a ruse was a doubling of the
hunted animal on
its own tracks. Rove (but not rover)
is
from archery, meaning in the first place 'to shoot arrows
at an arbitrarily selected target'. Bias, bowl over, and rub in
the phrase 'there's the rub' are from bowls, crestfallen and
white feather from cockfighting, and chess, check, checkmate,
cheque, and chequer come to us through the Arabian from
Persian, the central word being a corruption of the Persian
'Shah mat', meaning 'The Shah (the King)
is dead'.
It is
not so generally known that the varied meanings of all
these words are metaphors taken either from the game or
from the board on which it is played.
The more modern sports do not yet seem to have pro-
vided us with many new words, but there
is a promising
tendency to transmute some of their technical terms into
lively idiom, hi this way we can use, for example, to sprint,
to put on a spurt, the last lap, clean bowled, to take his middle
stump, to skate on thin
ice, to kick off, to tee off, one up,
.
.
.;
69

Modern England
and modern games have also been instrumental in preserv-
ing from oblivion the odd old French word bisque, of un-
known origin, which came over to England with the now
nearly
obsolete game of tennis,
as well
as
the French-
Scottish caddie.
When we hear a golfer use this word, when we hear a
Scotch person ask for an aschet, instead of a dish, or see the
queer expression petticoat-tails on a tin of Edinburgh short-
bread, we are taken back to the close connection between
the French and Scottish Courts which existed in the days of
Mary
Stuart.
For
caddie
is
a
corruption of the French
'cadet'
(younger son), whence also modern English cad
and
cadet;
aschet
is a form of the French
'assiette'; and
petticoat-tails a corruption of 'petits gateaux'
(little cakes).
Another phenomenon of history which is very faithfully
preserved in the English language is our long-standing and
not always creditable nautical relations with the Dutch.
From the fourteenth to the seventeenth century Dutch sea
words continued to trickle into the language, the fourteenth
seeing the arrival of bowsprit and skipper, the fifteenth of
freight, hoy, keel, lighter, pink, pump, scout, marline, and buoy,
the sixteenth of aloof, belay, dock, mesh,
reej, rover, and fly-
boat, while
the seventeenth century, when Van Tromp
nailed his broom to the mast, the Dutch fleet sailed up the
Medway, and William of Orange
sat upon the English
throne, gave us avast, bow, boom,
cruise,
cruiser, gybe, and
keelhaul.
Besides
these maritime words English possesses
certain military memories of the Dutch.
Freebooter goes
back to the war with Spain in the reign of Elizabeth, and
cashier, domineer, drill,furlough, and onslaught are also among
the words brought back from
the Low
Countries by
jo

Modern England
English soldiers. A particularly freakish Dutch borrowing
is the apparently English forlorn hope, which is in reality a
popular
corruption of the
Flemish
'verloren
hoop',
a
phrase that has nothing to do with hope and means a 'lost
expedition'.
The Spanish words in the English language,
like the
Dutch, are few in number, but often full of history. Those
which came originally from Arabic—the most interesting
of all—will be dealt with in another chapter. We received
them for the most part through the French.
Alligator, 1
chocolate,
cocoa, and tomato, which come through Spanish
from Mexican, commemorate
the
Spanish conquest of
Mexico, and breeze is a sixteenth-century adaptation of the
Spanish 'briza', a name for the north-east trade wind in the
Spanish Main. Of the
other words which come
to
us
through Spanish cannibal, hammock,
hurricane, maize, and
savannah are Caribbean, while canoe, potato, and tobacco are
South American. Cannibal, like the names West Indies and
Indian (meaning 'aboriginal inhabitant of America'), hides
a more detailed history. It was brought back by Christopher
Columbus, who believed, when he reached the islands of
the Caribbean Sea, that he had sailed right round the world,
back to the east coast of India. The name 'Caniba'—a vari-
ant of 'Carib' or 'Caribes'—he took as a proof that the
inhabitants were subjects ofthe Grand Khan ofTartary.
We can see, then, how the new impulse towards travel
and exploration which followed the Renaissance
left be-
hind, when
it ebbed, many exotic and exotic-sounding
words whose etymologies can
tell us not a
little of the
nationality of those adventurous mariners who led the way
1 A corrupted form of 'al-lagarto'—
'the lizard'.

Modern England
to the East and to the new world. The Spaniards were not
the only explorers. The Indian words coolie and curry come
to us through Portuguese; banana and negro reached us from
Africa, possibly by the same route; and cocoanut is from the
Portuguese
'coco',
a bugbear or bogy—alluding to the
nut's
monkey-like
face.
Drub—once
used
only
of the
bastinado—is thought to be an Arabic word brought back
by suffering Christians from the Barbary
States. Amuck,
bamboo, and cockatoo, come from Malayan through Portu-
guese, and
caddy
(the
receptacle) from Malayan
direct.
Moccasin, tomahawk, and hickory are among the words sent
back to us by the seventeenth-century English settlers in
North America.
Taboo,
tattoo, and kangaroo came home
with Captain Cook from the Pacific.
Meanwhile, the civil and political history ofEngland has
been growing steadily. Political, politics, politician, and par-
liamentary first appear in the sixteenth century, and Cabinet
Council seems to have been introduced at the accession of
Charles
I.
Cabal, one of the few Hebrew words in the
English language, probably owes
its
familiarity
to two
historical events.
It was applied in Charles
II's reign to a
small committee of the Privy Council, also known as the
'Committee for Foreign Affairs', which afterwards became
the Cabinet; moreover, a little later on it happened that the
names of the
five Ministers who
signed
the Treaty of
Alliance with France against Holland were Clifford, Arling-
ton, Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale. Their initials
thus arranged spell the word cabal, which was humorously
used to describe them. Another far commoner expression
which dates back to the Civil War is the phrase 'the army'.
It reminds us that we had no standing army until after the
12

Modern England
foundation
of the
Parliamentary
Forces.
Cavalier
and
Roundhead are words which carry their history, so to speak,
on their sleeves. They were both coined as terms of abuse,
and among other uncivil
relics of the Civil War which
have found a more extended application, fanatic and Puri-
tan were invented by the Royalists and malignant by the
Roundheads.
Independent and independence are also Puritan
words, and the useful demagogue first appeaerd in the Eikon
Basilike, the famous pamphlet in defence of the Crown,
which Milton answered with his Eikonoklastes. The expres-
sion to send to Coventry is probably a gift from the rebellious
citizens of Birmingham, who, according
to Clarendon,
frequently
'rose upon
small
parties of the
King's' and
either killed them or sent them, as prisoners, to Coventry,
which was a Parliamentary stronghold.
Spite, which always loves a rich vocabulary,
is also the
father of those venerable
labels
tory and whig. The old
Celtic word tory was first applied in the seventeenth cen-
tury
to
the unfortunate
Irish
Catholics,
dispossessed by
Cromwell, who became savage outlaws living chiefly upon
plunder; after that it was used for some time of bandits in
general, and
at the close of James
II's reign the 'Exclu-
sioners' found
it
a conveniently offensive nickname for
those who favoured the succession of the Roman Catholic
James, Duke of York. Thus, when William of Orange
finally succeeded in reaching
the throne,
it became the
approved name of one of the two great political parties in
Great Britain. Whig
is a shortened form of whiggamore, a
name given to certain Scotchmen from the word whiggam,
which they used in driving their horses. It was first used of
the rebellious Scottish Covenanters who marched to Edin-
13

Modern England
burgh
in
1648;
then of
the
Exclusioners, who
were
opposed
to
the
accession of James;
and
finally,
from
1689 onwards, of the other
great
political party or one
of its
adherents.
That the seventeenth century saw the true genesis of
many of our commercial and financial institutions
is sug-
gested by the fact that their names first appear at this time.
Such are capital, which is a doublet of cattle—the very oldest
Aryan form ofwealth 1—commercial, discount, dividend, insur-
ance,
investment, and lastly the modern meaning of bank,
which, like the names of so many protective and respon-
sible institutions—the Assizes, the Bench, the Consulate, the
Council, the Chair at a public meeting, a Seat in Parliament,
and the Throne—is based etymologically on what may well
be one of the oldest and safest of human occupations. The
old Teutonic word which subsequently became modern
English bench was adopted into Italian, probably from the
Teutonic Lombards ofnorthern Italy, in the form 'banco'.
It soon acquired the
special
sense of a moneychanger's
'bench'
or
table and found
its way,
together with the
object it represents, into most of the countries of Europe.
Thus, like the name Lombard Street, the little word carries
us back with it to the origin of banking in northern Italy
and to Edward I's substitution of Italian bankers for Jewish
moneylenders. Bankruptcy, currency, and remittance appeared
in the first half of the eighteenth century, and in the second
bonus,
capitalist, consols, and finance. The history offinance
is again interesting. The word goes right back to the Latin
'finis' (end). When it first appeared in English,
it had the
sense of a 'fine' or forfeit, but its modern significance was
1 See p. 56, note.
14

Modern England
developed in eighteenth-century France among the tax-
farmers or 'financiers',
as they were called, to whom the
king delegated the duty of collecting his
taxes. As time
went on, these shrewd individuals amalgamated into a sort
of limited company, which, by a judicious application of
the principles of usury, gradually gained more and more
control over
the
revenue,
until
'toutes
les
finances du
royaume', as Voltaire says, 'dependirent d'une compagnie
de commerce'. In England the phrase Bank ofEngland first
appears in 1694, describing a body ofindividuals associated
for the purpose of lending money to the Government; and
about thirty years later this
still
(1953) outstanding loan
began to be known as the National Debt.
From the beginning of the eighteenth century commer-
cial and
financial considerations seem
to have played a
steadily increasing part in deterrnining the nation's policy.
Horace Walpole
is the
first person known to have used
speculation in the sense of buying and
selling stocks and
shares; and
budget
(a
little bag or pocket) may owe
its
modern political meaning to a pamphlet sarcastically en-
titled The Budget Opened, in which his brother Robert's
financial
policy
received
some
severe
handling.
Prime
Minister also takes us back to Sir Robert Walpole, to whom
it was applied with derisive innuendo, for it had in those
days more the sense of 'Grand Vizier' or despot's tool. In
the old-fashioned nabob, as a synonym for 'plutocrat', we
have a memory of the latter days of the East India Com-
p any when the squandering of large sums of money in
London,
often rounded off a
life of empire-building
in
Bombay or Calcutta. The dictionary suggests, however,
that later generations of Anglo-Indians preferred to bring
15

Modem England
back with them
less questionable impedimenta, such
as
pyjamas and shampoo.
The
phrase,
the
Rights of Man,
takes
us back
to
the
American Declaration of Independence. The borrowing of
aristocrat and
democrat from
French,
the
French word
guillotine, and the appearance in English of revolutionize and
terrorize are enduring relics of the French Revolution, and
the word sectional, which came in in the nineteenth century,
is closely bound up with the history of France, for
it
is
derived
(together with
the geographical
use of section)
from the division of France into electoral sections under the
Directory. The military meaning of conscription goes back
to the France of the same period. To the campaigns in the
Soudan we owe zareeba, and to the Boer War the Dutch
words kopje and spoor. The 1914 War has left us the anony-
mous stunt and gadget (small mechanical contrivance), and
the French camouflage, and President Wilson's self-determin-
ation has probably been added to half the languages of the
world, while the expressions eyewash, to scrounge (meaning
to
'steal'), to get the wind up, to go west, and possibly to
swing the lead (to be idle at somebody else's expense), are
idioms which may or may not take a permanent hold. In
the second European War the Air Force has shown itself
more
'fertile and wonderful pregnant'
in
the
field of
vocabulary than the Army. But it
is too early yet to say
whether stooge and stooging, kite (for aeroplane), gen, bods,
and the rest ofthem will rise above the status ofslang.
A list of new words like anaesthetic, galvanometer, morse,
railroad, telephone, turbine,
.
.
. which appeared in the nine-
teenth century, would tell a full and fairly accurate story of
its extraordinarily sudden mechanical and scientific devel-
76

Modern England
opment, but such a list has yet to be compiled. More inter-
esting in many ways are the appearance ofnew metaphors
and idioms, such as to peter out, to pan out (from mining),
to blow off or get up steam and to go off the rails from the
steam engine, and many electrical metaphors such as those
mentioned in Chapter I. For new ways of doing are bound
up with new ways of knowing and thinking, and the true
story of the nineteenth century, as of every other century,
is the story of its mental and emotional outlook. To this
long and intricate story the rest of this book is devoted, but
before passing on to
it a few aspects of our subject, with
which there
is not space to deal
fully, may perhaps be
mentioned.
The light thrown by certain words on the social history
ofEngland, as opposed to her political history, is a clear and
often a new one. To look up in the Oxford Dictionary such
words as blackguard, carol, club, morris, teetotal, or a thousand
others which seem to have no particular historical signi-
ficance, and to read through the many illustrative quota-
tions,
is to take a wonderfully easy and intimate peep into
the past; while the dates at which such words as magazine,
news-letter, newspaper, novelist, press, or again,
callers, small
talk,
tea-party,
snob,
antimacassar,
.
.
. appeared,
together
with quotations showing the particular shades of meaning
with which they have been used, are in themselves a little
history of the English people. What could be more sugges-
tive, for instance, than the fact that the adjective improper
was first applied to human beings in the early fifties?
Words which are derived from the names of real indi-
viduals, as bowdlerize, boycott, burke, derrick, dunce, 1 galvan-

ize, mesmerism, morse, sandwich, tawdry, or fictitious ones, as
gamp, knickerbocker,
lilliputian, quixotic, pamphlet, pickwick-
ian, are sometimes, but not always, historically interesting.
Again, the place-names of England, whether of country
villages or London streets, are heavily loaded with the past,
but the subject is such a vast and disconnected one that it
would require, and in the Oxford Dictionary of Place-names
has received, a volume to itself.
The characteristics ofnations, as of races, are fairly accur-
ately reflected linguistically in the metaphors and idioms
they choose, in their tricks of grammar, in their various
ways of forming new words.
It
is,
for obvious reasons,
easier to apply this principle to other nations than to one's
own;
nevertheless
there
are
a
few
such
points which
English people can observe even in the English language.
The number of words and expressions drawn from sport
is a phenomenon which has already been touched upon,
and
it
is at any rate a question whether humour has not
played a larger part in the creation of English and Ameri-
can words than in those of other languages. The French
'tete' 1
is humorous in
origin, and there must be other
French and Latin-French words with a similar history, but
English has
really
quite
a number of words
in which
humour has taken a hand. One way in which this comes
about is the process known as back-formation. We realize
the facetious intention when somebody invents from the
noun swashbuckler
2. verb to swashbuckle, or to
buttle and
cuttle from butler and cutler, but it is not so well known that
the same process (probably with the same humorous intent
behind
it) gave us such sober words as
burgle,
sidle,
edit,
1 Seep. 137.
7*

Modern England
grovel,
beg, and greed. One of the most interesting back-
formations is the verb to maffick, formed from the supposed
present participle mafficking, which was coined to describe
the
festivities that greeted the
arrival
in London of the
news of the relief of Mafeking during the Boer War. The
well-known humorous device ofunderstatement is respon-
sible for the modern meaning of hit and most of its syn-
onyms. The notion of striking was once conveyed by the
verb to slay, by Tudor times, however, smite, which in Old
English meant to 'smear' or 'rub over', had become the
commoner word.
Strike
itself in Old English meant
' to
stroke' or 'to rub gently', and hit, which is now universal
in
serious
colloquial
speech, meant
to
'meet with'
or
'light upon'—'not to miss', in fact; just as to win
('not
to lose') something means, or at one time meant, in the
British Army,
to
steal
it. Blow and
thrash are both sly
agricultural metaphors, and the present popularity of such
slang phrases as wipe, and even paste, meaning to
strike,
and
to
wipe
out, suggests that this
pleasing
and
rather
simple form of humour
is
still active in English word-
formation.
But the number of these little etymological side-tracks is
almost
infinite. We
might,
for
instance,
ask
ourselves
whether the colloquial use of chap for 'individual' (from
the Old English 'cheapen' to 'buy', cognate with chapman,
cheap, Cheapside,
.
.
.)
is really the unconscious self-expres-
sion of a nation of shopkeepers, or whether
it
is purely
accidental; in which connection we should have to notice a
later tendency to renew a faded metaphor by substituting
the word merchant, and so on. But the truly scientific way
of approaching
this part of our subject
is to study the
19

Modern England
various English words which have been adopted by foreign
nations, and the meanings they have developed there.
These were few enough up to the end of the seventeenth
century, but from then on their number and importance
increased; and we cannot help being interested in them,
whether on the one hand the foreigner has merely em-
ployed them in despair of finding any word in his own
language adequate to describe the object or idiosyncrasy in
question, or whether his adoption of them implies that he
has also borrowed the things of which they are the names.
In the
first of these classes we should probably put cant,
comfort, gentleman, humbug, humour,
respectability,
romantic,
sentimental, snobbism, spleen,
.
.
.
; in the second,
ale,
beef-
steak, gin, grog, mackintosh, pudding, riding-coat (redingote),
roast-beef,
rum,
sport,
sportsman,
waterproof,
whisky,
and
various technical terms of sport such as box, Derby, handi-
cap,jockey,
.
.
.
To the second group also would belong our most impor-
tant contributions to foreign languages—the political words.
When we find bill, budget, committee, jury, lock-out, meeting,
pamphlet,
speech,
strike,
trade-union, ... on the Continent,
and realize that the modern meanings of European words
such as constitution, represent, vote, or of Old French words
like
address,
majority,
minority,
motion, parliament,
.
.
. are
derived from English, we feel ourselves in the presence, not
so much of something peculiarly English as of something
universal which England has been the means ofbringing to
earth. That vast theoretical terms like liberty, equality, and
fraternity should be borrowed by England from France in
return
for
committee,
jury,
meeting,

.
. that
the
French
ideologue and doctrinaire should be bartered for utilitarian and

Modern England
experimental—these
facts have been
taken
to
indicate
a
certain division of function in the economy of European
social
evolution,
the Frenchman producing
the
abstract
moral ideals and the Englishman attempting to clothe them
with reality. And
it may be that in such important loan-
words
as club and freemason and sport, but, above
all, in
committee—that boring but sensitive instrument for main-
taining the balance as between individual and associative
personality—we can perceive the Englishman's secret: his
power of voluntary co-operation, and his innate under-
standing ofthe give-and-take it requires.
While we can hardly expect to see an undistorted reflec-
tion of ourselves in the
first group of words mentioned
above, yet the grotesque meanings which many of them
have acquired abroad are interesting partly for that very
reason. They enable us, if studied carefully, to see ourselves
not only as others see us, but as others saw us. And from
both groups together we can
re-create,
as Mr.
Pearsall
Smith has pointed out, something of the curious England
which was 'discovered' about the middle of the eighteenth
century by the rest of Europe, can rejoice with Voltaire in
her atmosphere of religious toleration and personal liberty,
and admire with Montesquieu her haphazard constitution;
we can take back to our native France or Germany romantic
and sentimental memories of le
' lovely moon' des Anglois, or,
better
still,
delving
farther into
the
past, we can
stride
across the Italian stage in our top boots and our redingote,
a moody and spleenful English milord,
liable to commit
suicide at any moment.
Important as they are, however, we must not be misled
by this little group of words into supposing that English is

Modem England
a language which has given away much. On the contrary,
surveying
it as a whole, we are struck, above
all, by the
ease with which
it has
itself appropriated the
linguistic
products of others. Like Autolycus, or rather like Bernard
Shaw's Shakespeare,
its genius seems to have lain not so
much in originality as in the snapping up of unconsidered
trifles; and where it has excelled all the other languages of
Europe, possibly of the world, is in the grace with which it
has hitherto digested these particles of foreign matter and
turned them into
its own
life's blood.
Historically,
the
English language is a muddle; actually it is a beautiful, per-
sonal, and highly sensitive creature.

PART
II
THE WESTERN OUTLOOK


V
MYTH
PANIC
• TUESDAY
. MONEY
. SORCERY
• MAN
Let
us take two common English words, panic and
cereal, and compare them etymologically; we owe
both of them to the personages of classical myth-
ology. Cereal comes to us from Ceres, the Roman goddess
ofcorn and flowers, and panic is from Pan, a Greek Nature-
god, who was regarded as the protector offlocks and herds.
But here the resemblance ends; for not only
is one Latin
and the other Greek, but one is the name ofan object which
we can touch and see, while the other relates to that inner
world of human consciousness which cannot be grasped
with hands. Now it is important to notice that the word is
very much more closely connected with the thing in the
case of panic than in the case of cereal. Certainly, we are
interested
to know
that one of our words
for corn
is
derived from the name of a Roman goddess, but we do not
feel that it has much effect on our own ideas about corn.
We feel, in fact, that reflection on the word cereal will tell
us something about Rome, but very little either about corn
or about ourselves. With panic it is different. In that intan-
gible inner world words are themselves, as it were, the solid
S5

Myth
materials. Yet they are not solid as stones are, but rather as
human faces, which sometimes change their form as the
inner man changes, and sometimes, remaining practically
unaltered, express with the same configuration a developed
personality. 'Human speech and human thought,' said the
psychologist Wundt,
' are everywhere coincident.
.
.
. The
development of human consciousness includes in itself the
development ofmodes ofexpression. Language is an essen-
tial element ofthe function ofthinking.'
There was a time when no such word as panic existed,
just
as there was a time when no such word
as
electric
existed, and in this case, as in the other, before the word
first sprang into life in somebody's imagination, humanity's
whole awareness of the phenomenon which we describe as
'panic' must have been a different thing. The word marks
a discovery in the inner world of consciousness, 1 just as
electric2 marks a discovery in the outer world of physical
phenomena. Now
it was said that the connection of the
latter word, in
its Greek form, with 'amber' would be
informative if we had no other means of determining the
electrical properties of that substance. Words like panic are
important, because we really have no other means ofdeter-
mining how the ancients, who lived before the days of
literature and written records, thought and felt about such
matters.
Its derivation enables us to
realize that the early
1 There is as yet no satisfactory word in English to express quite what is
meant. The German 'Weltanschauung' (world-outlook)
is nearer to
it.
If,
however, the word consciousness is taken not simply in its finite sense, as
' the
opposite of unconsciousness', but rather as including a man's whole aware-
ness of his environment, the sum
total of his
intellectual and emotional
experiences as an individual, perhaps it may serve.
2 Seep. 13.
86

Myth
Greeks could become conscious of this phenomenon, and
thus name it, because they felt the presence of an invisible
being who swayed the emotions of flocks and herds. And
it also reveals how this kind of outlook 1 changed slowly
into the abstract idea which the modern individual strives
to express when he uses the word panic. At last, as that idea
grows more abstract still, the expression itselfmay change;
yet, just as the power to think of the 'quality' of an article
was shown to be the gift ofPlato, so it would be impossible
for us to think, feel, or say such things as 'crowd-psycho-
logy' or 'herd-instinct' if the Greeks had not thought, felt,
said 'Pan'—as impossible as it would be to have the leaf of
a plant without first having a seed tucked into the warm
earth. Hero, which originally meant a being who was half-
human and half-divine, is a similar descendant from Greek
religion which could not be extinguished from our voca-
bulary without restricting our outlook.
As to the number of words which are indirectly des-
cended from prehistorical religious feeling,
it
is not pos-
sible to count them. We can only say that the farther back
language as a whole
is traced, the more poetical and ani-
1 Like consciousness, this word must be taken here in its very widest, meta-
phorical sense, as of a human ego 'looking out' upon the world through the
windows of memory, recognition, the senses, etc., and of the cosmos which
it
'sees' through those windows.
It
is obvious that the outlook of every
individual will be slightly different from that of every other, also that there
will be a great difference between the average outlook ofbroad contemporary
classes, such, for instance, as learned and ignorant, artist and scientist, agnostic
and Roman Catholic. The widest gulf of all is likely to be that between the
average outlooks of different historical periods, and this will be increased if
we are dealing with different races—such as, for example, ancient Egyptians
and modern Americans—for in this case the dissimilarity will extend over
nearly every experience ofwhich the human outlook is composed.
Si

Myth
mated do its sources appear, until it seems at last to dissolve
into a kind of mist ofmyth. The beneficence or malignance
—what may be called the soul-qualities—of natural pheno-
mena, such as clouds or plants or animals, make a more
vivid impression at this time than their outer shapes and
appearances. 1 Words themselves are felt to be alive and to
exert a magical influence. But,
as the period which has
elapsed since the beginning of the Aryan culture is only a
tiny fragment of the whole epoch during which man has
been able to speak, it is only in glimpses that we can per-
ceive this; in a word here and a word there we trace but the
final stages of a vast, age-long metamorphosis from the
kind of outlook which we loosely describe
as 'mytho-
logical' to the kind which we may describe equally loosely
as 'intellectual thought'. To comprehend the process fully,
we must build up the rest of it in the imagination, just as,
from seeing a foot of cliffcrumble away at Dover, we may
set wings to time and call up the immemorial formation of
the English Channel.
The English words diurnal, diary, dial are derived from
the Latin 'dies'
(day), while journal comes to us, via the
French language, from the same word. These syllables con-
ceal among
themselves
the
central
religious conception
common to the Aryan nations. As far back as we can trace
them, the Sanskrit word 'dyaus', the Greek 'zeus' (accusa-
tive 'dia'), and the Teutonic 'tiu' were all used in contexts
where we should use the word sky; but the same words
were
also used to mean God,
the
Supreme
Being,
the
1 We may compare, unless we are enthusiastic naturalists, the enormously
different impression made upon ourselves by two such outwardly similar
creatures as a cockroach and a ladybird.

Myth
Father of all the other gods—Sanskrit 'Dyaus pitar', Greek
'Zeus pater',
Illyrian 'Deipaturos', Latin 'Juppiter'
(old
form 'Diespiter'). We can best understand what this means
ifwe consider how the English word heaven and the French
'del' are
still used for a similar double purpose, and how
it was once not a double purpose
at
all. There are
still
English and French people for whom the spiritual 'heaven'
is identical with the visible sky; and in the Spanish language
it is even a matter ofsome difficulty to draw the distinction.
But ifwe are to judge from language, we must assume that
when our earliest ancestors looked up to the blue vault they
felt that they saw not merely a place, whether heavenly or
earthly, but the bodily vesture, as it were, ofa living Being.
And this fact is
still extant in the formal resemblance be-
tween such words as diary and divine.
The French 'Dieu', with its close resemblance to 'dies',
retains the luminous suggestion of day and sky very much
more vividly than any of our words from the same stem,
but we have kept the Teutonic form nearly intact in Tues-
day. The fact that 'Tiu's day' came in as a translation of the
Latin 'Dies Martis' (surviving in French 'mardi') also sug-
gests that for the Teutons, alone among the Aryans, the
supreme Father-God afterwards became their god of war;
and this may throw some light both on their fundamental
character and on the nature of the experiences which they
encountered during the thousand odd years oftheir sojourn
in the northern forests.
It must not be assumed that the 'ancestors' spoken of
above are identical with the Aryans described in Chapter I.
By the time of the dispersion the thought of
' sky ' may
have been quite separated in the average Aryan mind from
8 9

Myth
the thought of 'God', or it may not have been. We cannot
say; we only know that at one time, among the speakers of
the Aryan language, these two thoughts were one and the
same. It is impossible to fix a point in time, and then to cut
a kind of cross-section, and define the exact relation be-
tween language and thought at that particular moment.
This relation—and especially in the domain ofreligion—is a
fluid and flickering thing, varying incredibly in individual
minds, leaping up and sinking down like a flame from one
generation to another. Consequently no two theories on
the religious beliefs held by the Aryans in the third millen-
nium B.C. are alike; and we are concerned here only with
those modern words which are the product of Aryan reli-
gious consciousness at some time or another in its history.
They come to us, naturally, by different routes, a few by
the south-eastern and any number by the north-western
group. Pariah, a non-Aryan word which has come into our
language from the East, derives its peculiar force from the
age-old division of India's population into castes. Ignite is
from the Latin
'ignis', which
is derived from the same
parent word as the Sanskrit 'Agni', the fire-god. In magic
we have a reminiscence of the Persian 'Magi', mighty
prophets and interpreters of dreams, of whom three were
said to have found their way to Bethlehem; but unless it be
in the modern trade-name Mazda, there
is
little, if any,
trace in our language of the great Persian religion of Zoro-
astrianism, with
its everlasting conflict between light and
darkness, Ahura Mazdao and Ahriman. The meagreness in
our language of these relics ofHindoo and Persian religion
is again eloquent of the total separation of the north-west-
ern and south-eastern Aryans. The whole vast structure of
9°

Myth
Eastern philosophy, with its intricate classifications cutting
completely across our own, was practically a sealed book to
the West until after the French re-established a commercial
connection with India in the eighteenth century. Signs are
not wanting, however, that the rapid growth of interest in
this ancient outlook, which has taken place in Europe during
the last fifty years, may enrich our vocabulary with some
extracts from the ancient terminology, such, for example,
as maya—the
soul's
external environment considered
as
being 'illusion', or as obscuring and concealing the spiritual
reality, and karma, the destiny of an individual as it is deve-
loped from incarnation to incarnation.
To turn from these nations to a member of the north-
western group, such as Greece, is, for the etymologist, like
passing from an arid desert into a land flowing with milk
and honey. Panic and hero have already been mentioned.
Iris (the flower, and also the part of the human eye), to-
gether with the beautiful word iridescent, have come to us
from the Greek goddess
Iris, whose outer form was the
rainbow. Titanic is from the Titans, huge earth-beings who
rebelled
against God much
as
did
the
fallen
angels
in
Genesis. Hermetically (in 'hermetically sealed') comes to us
from the Greek messenger god, Hermes, by a roundabout
route
(see Chapter VII); and in more or less common use
are aphrodisiac, Apolline, Asia, Atlas, chimera, daedal, Dion-
ysiac, Etysian, Europe, Hades, harmony, Muse and music,
mystery,
nemesis, nymph,
paean,
panacea,
phaeton,
pro-
tean,
satyr,
siren,
stygian. The word
erotic, from Eros, a
Greek god of love, is an interesting example of the way in
which the experiences of past civilizations evaporate into
essential refinements of modern speech. Because of differ-
9 l

Myth
ences between Greece and Rome, which it took about two
thousand years to work out on the stage of history, we are
now able to make a fine distinction, such as that between
erotic and amorous.
The true Roman god of love, however, though in the
world of phantasy he
still survives in his original form,
Cupid, has only actually entered our language in the word
cupidity. In the difference between the material associations
of cupidity and the more imaginative ones of erotic we begin
already
to
divine
a
fundamental
dissimilarity between
Greek and Roman mythology. Other words which come
to
us from Roman religion are cereal, genius, fate, fortune,
fury, grace, June, mint, money, Saturday, vesta, the names of
the planets, contemplate, sacrifice, temple, Host (from 'hostia',
the victim which was sacrificed), augury, and auspice. The
last two words
take us back
to
the Roman custom of
divining the will of the gods by watching the nights of
birds.
' Aves-specere' meant 'to see birds', and we still have
the first word preserved to us in aviary. Fury and grace are
translations of Greek names; but in some of the others
especially money and mint, from the goddess Moneta—we
behold the late reflection of a highly significant process. It
is
this: As time went on, Roman religious feeling quickly
changed in two almost opposite ways. On the one hand it
attached
itself more and more
to concrete and material
objects, and, on the other, its gods and goddesses were felt
less and less as living beings, and more and more as mere
abstract
intellectual conceptions. Yet
these two changes
were not really opposite, but complementary. For as the
visible part of a goddess like Ceres became more and more
solid, as she came more and more to be used simply as a
92

Myth
synonym for corn, the invisible part of her naturally grew
more and more attenuated. Thus, the mythical world was
much less real to the Romans than it had been to the Greeks.
It was more like a world ofmental abstractions.
Soon there was a
' god', or part ofa god, for every object
and every activity under the sun, and when the empire was
founded, each emperor, as he died, automatically became a
divinity. Today the first two 'divine' emperors, Julius and
Augustus,
take
their
places
beside Juno,
the Queen of
Heaven, in our monthly calendar. We may say, in
fact,
that by the time Christianity began to spread in the Roman
Empire, Roman official religion had become divorced from
feeling altogether, its dry bones remaining little more than
a convenient system of nomenclature. Not that the new
religion had no serious rivals; but the doctrines of Stoics
and Epicureans, the Mystery Schools, and cults such as that
of Mithras, had
little historical connection with Roman
mythology. Yet if Rome contributed no
discoveries of
value concerning the relations ofhuman beings to the gods,
it was perhaps for this very reason that she was able to con-
centrate more exclusively upon working out their relations
with each other; and in so doing she created jurisprudence.
But in the later days of the empire, when this attenuation
of
the imaginative and supernatural element in Roman
mythology had already gone beyond its logical conclusion,
when Rome had absorbed the myths of Greece and Egypt
and sterilized them both, the soul of Europe was stirring
afresh in the north. Contact between the Roman tongue
and that of their subjects, the Celtic 'Galli' in north Italy
and beyond the Alps, had grown more and more intimate.
Gradually there came into being a sort of hybrid Low Latin,
93

Myth
the father of modern French and the other Romance lan-
guages, which in many cases expressed Celtic notions and
feelings in Latin forms. So it was that new life came to be
breathed into some of the dead abstractions of Roman
mythology; but
it was a very different life from the old
one. Thus, the old Roman deity Sors (Chance) had long
ago developed for the Romans into a purely abstract idea,
referring to the drawing of lots. But up in the north, far
away from the capital, the 'sortiarius' became a mysterious
teller of fortunes by that means. As the years went on, the
syllables softened and smoothed and shortened themselves,
until they became the old French
'sorrier' from which
'sorcerie' was formed, and so our English
sorcery.
It
is
strange to think how far this word has travelled from its
origin; and in the work of a modern poet we find it travel-
ling even farther, changing from a process into a sort of
mysterious realm:
Heart-sick ofhisjourney was the Wanderer;
Foot-sore and sad was he;
And a Witch who long had lurked by the wayside,
Looked out ofsorcery
It was much the same with 'Fata'. For the Romans them-
selves the old goddesses called the Fata, or Fates, turned
quickly into an abstracted notion of destiny. But contact
with the dreamy Celts breathed new life into their nostrils,
and 'Fata' in Late Latin became spiritual once more. The
sharp sounds were softened and abraded until they slipped
imperceptibly into Old French 'fee' (Modern English^y),
and so fa-ery and fairy. Demon
is the
result of a similar
metamorphosis.
94

Myth
Now in dealing with mythology nothing is more mis-
leading than
to compare
the gods of different
nations,
assuming
that
those who
have
etymologically
similar
names meant the same thing
to
their worshippers. For
instance, it has been pointed out that the name Tiu descends
from a word which also developed elsewhere into Dyaus
and Zeus, but to suggest that Tiu was the 'same god' as
Zeus would have little meaning.
And it is the same with
the other persons ofnorthern mythology, such as Thor, the
thunder-god, from whom we have
Thursday, or Wotan
(Odin) who taught men language and gave up his eye in
order to possess his beloved Fricka (Wednesday and Friday).
There are many external resemblances, etymological and
otherwise,
between
this
Teutonic mythology
and
the
mythology ofGreece, but for the historical study ofhuman
consciousness it is the differences between them which are
really significant. Here there is no room to consider either
the resemblances or the differences, except in so far as they
are preserved for us in the words we use. And we notice at
once how small is the number of our words which refer to
the Teutonic myths. Where relics still remain they seem to
be either—like elf, goblin, pixy, puck, troll—the names of the
creatures themselves, still used but no longer felt to exist, or
else—like
cobalt and
nickel, the names given by German
miners to demoniac spirits—they have lost all memory of
their original meaning.
There are, of course, exceptions, such as Easter, from an
old Teutonic goddess of the spring, Old Nick, from 'nicor',
a fabulous
sea-monster, and
nightmare from
the demon
Mara, while the concepts earth and
lie (untruth) may pos-
sibly have originated as the divinities Erda and Loki. But
95

Myth
compared with
the number of derivations from
older
myths these examples are practically negligible. There is an
accidental quality about them, and few have entered very
deeply into our language. The Aryan family was now
growing older and more firmly knit. While Slavs, Teutons,
and Celts were
still uncivilized, their cousins, the Greeks
and Romans, had already developed an elaborate culture.
Had the former been left alone like the latter, their myth-
ology, too, might in time have grown down into the lan-
guage. But that was not to be. The great Aryan family did
not lose touch long enough. When Rome came, and with
her
Christianity,
the
missionaries
naturally
assured
the
believers in Thor and Wotan that Thor and Wotan were
not. And coming, as they did, from a developed civilization,
they not only ousted the old Teutonic gods from the lan-
guage, but brought with them a supply of ready-made
Greek and Latin words, many of which—did they but
know
it—drew their peculiar shades of meaning from a
pagan mythology which they held in equal abhorrence.
The classical gods and goddesses faded so slowly into the
thin
air of abstract thought that the process was hardly
perceived, but the Nibelungs and Valkyries, the Siegfrieds
and Fafnirs of Teutonic myth, were doomed while they
were still alive. Thus our fathers beheld the death ofBaldur
with their own eyes, and were awake during the twilight
of the gods.
Ofcourse, where the events ofTeutonic myth and legend
were associated with a particular
locality,
they have left
their mark in the names of places. These, naturally enough,
are found for the most part in Germany. In Great Britain
apart from Asgardby, Aysgarth, Wayland Smith, Wansdyke,

Scotland,
Wales, and Cornwall. Apart from place-names, galahad is
a relic of Celtic legend which has found a permanent place
and a modern usage in the language; and there may be one
or two others. But not many. In England the whole Celtic
nation and language died early out of the common con-
sciousness, and it died even more suddenly than the persons
of Teutonic myth. This explains the freshness and delight
which many young writers of the last generation found in
the language and legend of Irish antiquity. To resuscitate,
as Keats did, the invisible beings of classical mythology was
to dig down into the roots ofour present everyday outlook;
to take part in the Celtic revival was to feel that you were
looking out on the world through an entirely new window
—or at any rate through one which had not been cleaned
for centuries.
We seem only to owe one English word to the Slavonic
myths,
and
that
is
the
unpleasant
vampire, which was
brought back from the East by travellers in the eighteenth
century.
The general relation between language and myth
is,
as
the word myth (Greek 'muthos'—narrative speech) suggests,
almost unfathomable; but before leaving the limited Aryan
aspect, which is all we have had space to touch on here, one
interesting etymology ought
to be mentioned, which
has
sometimes been taken to conceal the whole root and purpose
of Aryan culture in the history of mankind. The Hindoos
look back to a great teacher called Manu. Whether this indi-
91

Myth
vidual himself, or his name, is historical or mythical is not
particularly important. Hindoo sacred language and litera-
ture reveal
at any rate a prehistoric belief among certain
classes of society that Manu was the originator of their
culture and religion. Now 'manu'
is also their word for
man; and about this word,
as
it appears in the different
Aryan languages, there are two interesting points. The first
is that wherever it crops up it bears the double meaning of
'human being' and 'member of the male sex'; the second
that it is thought to be cognate with the root 'men', imply-
ing 'to think', which appears also in English mind, Latin
'mens',
.
.
. We have seen that to the external view one of
the most remarkable characteristics in which Aryans dif-
fered from the races they supplanted was their patriarchal
system. The etymology of the word man suggests the inner
reason for this, for it hints at a dim consciousness among the
Aryans that the essential function of the human being—at
any rate ofthe Aryan human being—is to think.
And side by side with the conception of the human being
as a 'thinker', we find an instinctive feeling that the human
race
is especially represented by
its male portion. To the
Aryan outlook, wherever we find
it, the human being
is
man, and God is God the Father. What exotic matriarchies
may have held sway before humanity began to worship
logic and mascuhnity we cannot
say,
for our language
throws light only on that tiny portion of humanity's inner
and outer history which is the peculiar contribution of the
Aryan races; and, in doing so,
it suggests that, in spite of
their tendency towards monogamy and
a
rigid family
organization, the 'subjection' ofwomen has its roots very
deep in Aryan psychology. In this respect Greece and Rome
98

Myth
differed but little in essence from India and Persia. The im-
pulse towards a different conception of women, both in
their own minds and in the minds of men, which has been
giving an increasing amount of trouble to the European
races for the last two thousand years, was really, as we shall
see, implanted in the Aryan outlook by foreign religions.

TheifferencebetweenGreekandRornancharacter,
which is marked so plainly by the way in which
Aryan myths developed among the two peoples
and moulded the finer meanings of their languages,
is evi-
dent in many other English words besides those which we
can actually trace back to such myths. For instance, the
Greek 'scandalizein' and the Latin 'offendere' both meant
to 'cause to stumble', but for us there is a subtle difference
between
scandalize and
offend;
for while
scandalize and
scandal merely hint at the liveliness of an emotion, offend
and offence convey a sober warning of its probable results.
'Discere' in Latin and 'mathein' in Greek both meant to
'learn'; but the substantives which are derived from these
verbs have come down into our language, the one as discip-
line and the other as mathematics. Rome turned instinctively
to the external, Greece to the inner world as a vehicle for
the expression of her impulses. And just as 'learning' for
the Roman
gradually came
to mean
'learning
to be
a
soldier', so the ordinary Latin word for 'teacher' (doctor)
100

Philosophy and Religion
is now applied most commonly to a teacher of physical
health. And these two are not the only Latin words which
have hurried out of school in
this way.
'Magister',
for
instance, has exchanged the class-room for the police-court
and
left behind the Greek 'paidagogos'
(pedagogue)
to
express the most schoolmasterish kind of schoolmaster that
can be imagined. Perhaps the most significant of all is school
itself. Words
for
'teaching'
and
'learning' among
the
Romans
inevitably
came
to
express unacademic
ideas.
When they did want a word for academic processes they
had to borrow it, like 'schola', from Greece. Yet, curiously
enough, the original meaning of 'schole' in Greek was not
school at all. What the Roman felt about the whole business
of book-learning and disputing and thinking and talking
philosophy is indeed conveyed to us clearly enough by the
meaning of the Latin 'schola', from which we have taken
school. But to a Greek all this had been merely the natural
way of spending his spare time. 'Schole' was the common
Greek word for 'leisure'.
Now this insatiable appetite ofthe Greek mind for think-
ing and philosophy is a phenomenon in the history of the
Western outlook as sudden and unaccountable as the ap-
pearance of the Aryan peoples on the stage of history. As
far back as the sixth or seventh century B.C. we find, side
by side with the popular Greek mythology, a developed
and intricate system ofphilosophy—a kind oflanguage and
thought, in fact, which, as the labyrinthine history of our
own tongue is enough to show us, could not possibly have
sprung up in the night. And in their writings the Greek
philosophers themselves allude to sources from which they
may well have taken the seeds of abstract thought. Refer-
101

Philosophy and Religion
ences are made as early as Pythagoras and as late as Plato to
the priestly wisdom of Egypt; and when we remember
that the time which elapsed between the rise of Egyptian
civilization and the birth of Homer is about as long as the
period between Homer's day and our own, we need not be
surprised. Moreover, we find some evidence of the debt to
Egypt in our language. Two almost indispensable pre-
requisites for the development of philosophy are the art of
writing and something
to write upon.
It
is
interesting,
therefore, to observe that our word alphabet comes to us,
through Latin, from the first two letters in the Greek alpha-
bet—'alpha' and 'beta'—which are themselves in the first
place Phoenician words. Greek mythology looked back to
Cadmus, a Phoenician, as the founder of the alphabet, and
it is now believed that the Semitic Phoenicians did indeed
bring writing into Greece, and that they themselves took it
from the 'hieratic script' or priestly writing of Egypt. Jot,
in the phrase 'jot or tittle', is an English form invented by
the
translators of the Authorised Version for the Greek
letter 'iota', which
is also of Phoenician origin. Bible, on
the other hand,
is from the Greek 'biblos', which meant
'the inner bark of the papyrus', and so
'a book'; and paper
was borrowed by
the
Angles and
Saxons from
Latin
'papyrus',
itself a transliteration of the Greek 'papuros',
meaning an Egyptian rush or flag, ofwhich writing mate-
rial was made. Both these words
are thought to be of
Egyptian origin. 1
1 And linked with an Egyptian myth of the origin of the alphabet; for
By bios was the Greek name for the Phoenician city when the ark contain-
ing the fourteen pieces of the body of Osiris was cast ashore and rescued
by
lsis.
I am informed by
a very learned friend that the same word
is
connected— particularly through Etruscan—with the God Dionysus, who
suffered
a similar dismemberment.
102

Philosophy and Religion
External evidence tells us that already, a thousand years
before the Aryans began to move, Egypt had mapped out
the stars in constellations and divided the zodiac into twelve
signs, and we are told by Aristotle that the Egyptians 'ex-
celled in mathematics'. But if there was among the priests
a 'philosophy' in our sense of the word, we know little of
it—perhaps because
truth, unadorned by myth, was re-
garded in those days as something dangerous, to be kept
religiously secret from
all save those who were specially
prepared to receive it. This idea ofinner religious teachings,
guarded carefully from the ignorant and impure, survived
in great force among the Greeks themselves, and we come
across references in their philosophy to institutions called
Mysteries, which were evidently felt by them to he at the core
of their national and intellectual life. Thus that hard-worked
little English trisyllable, without which minor poetry and
sensational journalism could barely eke out a miserable
existence, has a long and dignified history, into which we
must pry a little farther ifwe wish to understand how Greek
thought and feeling have passed over into our language.
We have adopted from Latin the word
initiate, which
meant 'to admit a person to these Mysteries', and the im-
portance attached
to
secrecy
is shown by the
fact
that
'muein', the Greek for 'to
initiate', meant originally 'to
keep
silent'. From
it
the
substantive
'mu-sterion' was
developed,
thence
the
Latin
'mysterium',
and
so
the
English word. The
secrets of the Greek Mysteries were
guarded so jealously and under such heavy penalties that
we still know very little about them. All we can say is that
the two principal ideas attaching to them in contemporary
minds were,
firstly, that they revealed in some way the
103

Philosophy and Religion
inner meaning of external appearances, and secondly, that
the 'initiate' attained immortality in a sense different from
that of the
iininitiated. The ceremony he went through
symbolized dying in order to be 'born again', and when it
was over, he believed that the mortal part of his soul had
died, and
that what had risen again was immortal and
eternal. Such were the associations which Saint Paul had in
mind, and which he
called
to
the imaginations of his
hearers, when he made use of the impressive words: 'Be-
hold, I tell you a mystery
!
' And it is the same whenever the
word occurs elsewhere in the New Testament and in writ-
ings of that period, for it retained its technical meaning and
associations well on into the Christian era. 1
The
first man—as
far
as we know—to
call himself a
'philosophos', or lover of wisdom, was Pythagoras, who
applied the label to himself and his followers. Philosophy
among the Pythagoreans, with its emphasis on astronomy,
geometry, and number, was
still decidedly Egyptian; but
gradually, from these starry beginnings, the Greek mind
built up a vast, independent edifice of thought and lan-
guage. The words
that have come
into
our language
directly from Greek philosophy are numerous enough, but
ifwe were to add those which have reached us in Latinized
form, and finally those words which are actually Latin, but
which take their meaning from the Greek thought they
were used to translate, we should fill several pages with the
1 Sec also p. 120. The Temple scenes in Mozart's Magic Flute are a Free-
mason's attempt to depict the proceedings within an Egyptian Mystery
School, and the opera itself is plainly a fanciful treatment of the drama of
initiation. (Incidentally, the noises made by Papageno when he attempts to
sing with the padlock on his lips are an excellent illustration of the possibly
natural origin ofthe root 'mu-' in 'mu-ein'.)
104

Philosophy and Religion
mere enumeration of them. The list would spread itself all
over the dictionary, varying from such highly technical
terms as method, homonyvi and noumena to common ones
like individual and subject.
Perhaps a more accurate term than Greek philosophy
would be 'Greek thought', for Greek thinkers took some
time to arrive at the distinction, so familiar to us, between
philosophy and other branches ofstudy such as history. The
Greek word
'historia' meant at
first simply 'knowledge
gained by inquiry', and some of the words which follow
are first found in the works of Hesiod and Herodotus.
Among the words which have come to us from earlier
Greek thought are cosmos
1—the name applied by the Pytha-
goreans to the universe, which they perceived as a
' shapely'
and harmonious whole—geometrical terms such as pyramid
(probably of Egyptian
origin),
hypotenuse and
isosceles)
many of the technical terms of music,
as chord, harmony,
melody, tone; of literature: hyperbole, metaphor, rhetoric, syn-
tax,
trope; and a host of common words of wider signi-
ficance,
such
as
academy,
analogy,
aristocracy,
astronomy,
cosmogony,
critic,
democracy,
eclipse,
economic,
enthusiasm,
ethical, genesis, grammatical, hypothesis, mathematical, method,
phenomenon, physical, poetic, politics, rhythm, theology, theory.
1 This word has been used by English writers in various ways—generally
as a synonym for universe. Of late, however, there has perhaps been a slight
tendency to differentiate it by making it mean the universe as seen andfelt by a
particular individual or body of individuals—'the cosmos
of our experience'.
This distinction appears to be a fruitful one and will be adopted here. As the
words are used in this book, therefore, we should say that there is only one
universe, but as many cosmoses as there are individuals. In this way the word
cosmos becomes a sort of tool with which we can detach, and objectify for the
purpose of inspection, the purely subjective consciousness or outlook (see pp.
82 and 83, notes).
105

Philosophy and Religion
Of those which were translated into Latin by Cicero and
other Latin writers, and possibly by Greek schoolmasters in
Rome,
we
may
mention
element,
essence,
individual,
quality,
question,
science,
species, and vacuum, together with
most of the terminology of grammar, such as adjective, case,
gender, noun, number, verb,
.
.
. Type comes from 'typos',
a figure or image impressed or struck—from the verb 'typ-
tein', to hit or strike.
In a sense, the thought of the earlier Greek philosophers
may be said to have reached
its consummation,
its very
fullest expression,
in the writings of Plato. Among the
words which are
first found in his works are the Greek
originals of analogy,
antipodes,
dialectic, enthusiasm, mathe-
matical, synthesis, and system; while he imparted a new and
special meaning to many others like method, musical, philo-
sopher,
sophist,
theory,
type,
irony
(the name he gave to
Socrates's peculiar method ofsimulating ignorance in order
to impart knowledge), and, ofcourse, idea and ideal. Before
Plato used it, the word 184a meant simply the form or sem-
blance of anything. It is connected with 'idein', 'to see', 1
and when Cicero came to translate
it, he had to use the
Latin word 'species', which had a similar meaning, being
connected with
'specere',
'to
see'
and
'speculum',
'a
mirror'. Today idea does not mean to us quite what
iSe'a
did to Plato; but tracing the whole history of the word, we
can see how it was Plato who, by his creative use of these
four letters, began to make it possible for us to get outside
our thoughts and look
at them,
to
separate our
'ideas'
about things from the things themselves.
Thus, it was not only Greek words of which he was to
1 See p.
1 6.
1 06

Philosophy and Religion
alter the meanings, nor only Greek and Latin words. Love
and good, for instance, are neither Greek nor Latin, and
beauty is only Latin remotely, yet the spirit of Plato really
works more amply in them, and in a hundred others bear-
ing on the presence or absence of these qualities, than
it
does in such specifically Platonic terms as idea and dialectic.
Let us try and trace the origin of some of the meanings
which are commonly attached to the word love. As in the
Mysteries, so at the heart ofearly Greek philosophy lay two
fundamental assumptions. One was that an inner meaning
lay hid behind external phenomena. Out of this Plato's
lucid mind brought to the surface of Europe's conscious-
ness the stupendous conception that
all matter
is but an
imperfect copy of spiritual 'types' or 'ideas'—eternal prin-
ciples which, so far from being abstractions, are the only
real Beings, which were in their place before matter came
into existence, and which will remain after
it has passed
away. The other assumption concerned the attainment by
man of immortality. The two were complementary. Just
as it was only the immortal part of man which could get
into touch with the eternal
secret behind the changing
forms of Nature, so also it was only by striving to contem-
plate that eternal that man could develop the eternal part
of himself and put on incorruption, There remained the
question of how to
rise from the contemplation of the
transient
to
the contemplation of the
eternal,
and,
for
answer, Plato and Socrates evolved that other great con-
ception—perhaps even more far-reaching in
its historical
effects—that
love
for
a
sensual and temporal
object
is
capable of gradual metamorphosis into love for the in-
visible and eternal. It is not only in the New Testament and
ioj

Philosophy and Religion
the Prayer Book,
in
the Divine Comedy,
Shakespeare's
Sonnets, and
all great Romantic poetry that the results of
this thinking are to be seen. Through the Church and the
poets to the dramatist and the novelist, and through them
to the common people—there is no soulful drawing-room
ballad, no cinema-plot, no day-dream novelette or genteel
text on the wall of a cottage parlour through which, every
time the hackneyed word is brought into play, the authentic
spirit of Plato does not peep for a moment forlornly out
upon us.
In
the
latter
days of Plato's
life
there came
to
the
* Academy' where he taught a young man from Stagira in
Macedonia. His name was Aristotle, and after he left Plato
he became for a time the tutor of Alexander the Great. In
spite of their proximity in time and space, the difference
between Plato's method of thought and the Aristotelian or
peripatetic system can hardly be exaggerated. While Plato
had concentrated
his
intellectual effort on mapping out
what we should now call the 'inner' world ofhuman con-
sciousness; starting from the point ofview of ancient tradi-
tion and myth, and working outward; relating his thoughts
to one another in accordance, as it were, with their own
inherent qualities; and deducing the sense-world from the
spiritual world; Aristotle turned to the acquisition ofknow-
ledge about the outer world of matter and energy—that is
to say, that part of the world which can be apprehended by
the five senses and the brain. The two philosophers were
alike in their emphasis on the importance of cultivating
immortality—or rather of 'immortalling'
(for they used a
special verb which we have lost), but otherwise there were
few resemblances indeed. To Plato the soul of the universe
1 08

Philosophy and Religion
had seemed inseparable from his own soul, and natural
phenomena such as the revolutions of the planets had inter-
ested him rather as tangible, outward pictures of the life
within that soul. To Aristode the world outside himself
was interesting more for its own sake. Plato had looked up
to
'Ideas'—real Beings with an existence of their own,
which stood behind physical phenomena rather than within
them. Aristotle deliberately attacked this doctrine, main-
taining that the Ideas were immanent; they could not have
existed before
visible Nature, nor could they have any
being apart from it; and they could only be arrived at, he
said, by investigating Nature
itself. When Aristotle laid
down his pen after writing the Metaphysics, the word idea
had taken a long step towards its present meaning.
Thus in Aristotle's imagination the two worlds, outer
and inner, met and came into contact in quite a new way.
The mind was,
as
it were, put at the absolute disposal of
matter; it ceased to brood on what arose from within, and
turned
its attention outwards. The result of this was, of
course, an enormous increase in the amount of knowledge
concerning the material processes of the outer world. But
that was not the first result. For, curiously enough, the first
result was a pronounced hardening and sharpening of the
mind's own outlines.
Struggling to
fit herself,
as into
a
glove,
to
the processes of cause and
effect observed
in
physical phenomena, the mind became suddenly conscious
of her own shape. She was astonished and delighted. She
had discovered
logic. The actual Greek word
'logic'
(•>?
XoyiK-tj
rexvrj)
is
first found with
its present meaning in
Cicero, but he is speaking of Aristotle; the thing itself and
the technique of it was the invention of Aristotle, and it
109

Philosophy and Religion
was
Aristotle who
first
used
the word
syllogism
in
its
modern sense.
Perhaps the most significant of all those words which are
first found in Aristotle's treatise on Logic is analytic. Here is
indeed a new word made to express a new kind of think-
ing. Energy,
entelechy,
ethics, physiology, and synonym, are
further examples of words which, as far as we know, were
actually created by Aristotle, while we owe metaphysics to
the accident of his having treated that subject after ('meta')
his treatise on Physics. Axiom,
category, mechanics,
organic,
physics, and synthesis are Greek words which take
their
modern meanings chiefly from Aristotle; but his emphasis
on the concrete and his constant gravitation towards a kind
ofknowledge which might turn out to be practically useful
evidently made him a favourite with the Roman mind.
Consequently many of his words have come down to us
translated into Latin. Among those which we can actually
trace are absolute,
actual,
definition,
equivocal,
induction, in-
stance,
moral,
potential, property,
quintessence,
subject, 1
sub-
stance,
virtual, and the grammatical term particle; of the
plentiful number which have flown, more indirectly, from
his mind we may mention
conceit and
concept,
deduction,
difference, experiment, principle, and universal. In quantity
(a
translation of the Greek 'posotes'—'how-muchness'—and
seemingly formed by Aristotle on the analogy of Plato's
'poiotes', from which we have quality) we can perhaps see
1 It
is curious how many of these would-be precise terms have
since
reversed their meanings. For the adjective derived from subject see p. 171;
virtual, which was once allied with potential as the opposite of actual, is now
practically a synonym for the latter term; and the Greek word from which
instance is taken was originally an objection to an argument, not an example
of it.
1 10

the beginning of that interest in the calculable aspect of the
objects of the visible world from which the exact sciences
have arisen. The human mind had now begun to weigh and
measure, to examine and compare; and that weighing and
measuring has gone on—with intervals—for twenty-three
centuries.
Thus, Platonic philosophy fades from our view in the
person of Socrates, proving by analogy the immortality of
the soul of man and the soul of the world; and the fatal
chill has scarcely risen to his heart when Aristotelian philo-
sophy comes over the horizon, vigorously investigating by
analysis the structure and composition of the body of man
and the body of the world. Thanks to his friendship with
Alexander,
Aristotle
himself had
hitherto
unparalleled
opportunities
for
collecting information on every con-
ceivable subject. Knowledge, often inaccurate enough, was
garnered from the four quarters of the civilized world, old
manuscripts were edited and compared,
and, above
all,
Nature herselfwas observed in a way which was quite new.
After his death his followers went on putting his methods
into practice. Side by side with the weighing and measuring
went naming. And so to the three or four hundred years
which followed we owe a good deal of the technical termi-
nology of our
arts and sciences.
It was
at
this time, for
instance, that botany first developed into a science. Many
of the names ofour commonest wild-flowers can be traced
back to writings of the period, and the following examples
are
all taken from the
first half of the alphabet:
aconite,
amaranth, balsam, balm, box, calamint, celandine, cherry, chest-
nut, chicory, germander,
heliotrope, marjoram,
melilot. More-
over, nearly
all the technical terms of botany are Greek,
///

Philosophy and Religion
and though most of them, including the word botany itself,
were created later, writers of this period may be said to
have given the lead with such learned labels as calyx, peri-
anth, and gymnosperm.
When we are 'dating' a word in this way, however, we
must remember
that only a fragment of the whole of
Greek literature has come down to us. Thus we cannot be
sure, because a flower-name first occurs, about the end of
the fourth century
B.C., in a writer of the Alexandrian
period, that it was actually created by him or his contem-
poraries. Anemone,
asparagus,
bugloss,
celery,
centaury,
cle-
matis,
coriander,
crocus,
lily,
medlar, and mint
all go right
back to Classical Greek, while petal and possibly spore are
botanical terms which were already in use. On the whole,
the Alexandrians probably
collected,
arranged, and
re-
newed the meanings of more words than they actually
created.
This is even truer in the case of medicine. The analytical
method ofthought led naturally in Alexandria to the actual
dissection of bodies, living and dead. Aristotle himself is
still regarded as the founder of comparative anatomy (cut-
ting up), and
it was he who
first used
this word in
its
medical sense. The peculiar meaning of the word empirical,
moreover, derives from a set of physicians who held that
practice was the one thing necessary in their art. It might
be
thought
that
with
this
foreshadowing
of modern
'methods' there would have been a great influx of new
information and new terminology. In actual fact we find
that the Greek words
(and their name
is legion) in the
terminology ofmedical science were either created later by
the different European peoples, or else they appear in the
112

Philosophy and Religion
works of Hippocrates,
a physician who was practicing in
Athens and elsewhere before Plato was born. Among the
words found
in Hippocrates
are
the Greek
originals
of
arthritis, catalepsy, diarrhoea, dropsy, dysentery, epidemic,
erysipelas, haemorrhage, hypochondriac, hysteria, nephritis,
ophthalmia, paregoric, phlebotomy, phthisis, quinsy , rheum,
and sciatica; while the word apoplexy
is particularly inter-
esting because its Latin translation, 'sideratio', shows that it
originally had the sense of 'star-struck' or 'planet-struck*.
Crisis is Hippocrates' name for the crucial point at which a
disease takes a turn for the worse or the better. It came to
England with this meaning in the sixteenth century, and
was gradually extended to cover first 'the conjunction of
stars on which
this
"crisis"
depended', and then
'any
critical situation'. Anaemia, however, and possibly enteric,
seem to have been first used by Aristotle.
The centre of all this furious intellectual activity was the
city ofAlexandria. Nor was it confined to scientific spheres;
for the results of religious and philosophical developments
which now took place in and around the cosmopolitan city
in the north ofEgypt were, if anything, more far-reaching
than those of empirical science. Indeed,
it was from this
point in history that theology and science first 1 began to be
two separate studies, science eventually following the lead
given by Aristotle and religion brooding over the profundi-
ties of Platonic or neo-Platonic philosophy and saturating
them with feeling. Between Aristotle and Plato is the great
divide from which flowed in two different directions two
1 The striking exception
is the fifth-century philosopher, Democritus,
who definitely foreshadowed the Atomic Theory and, in fact, gave to the
word atom its modern meaning.
113

Philosophy and Religion
separate streams, as it were, of human outlook; and just as the
modern European, whether or no he possesses any genuine
scientific knowledge, can trace the general shape and method
of his thinking back to the former, so, whether or no he calls
himself a Christian, he must trace much ofwhat he regards
as his ordinary
' feelings ' back to the latter.
For the stream of Platonic thought was now to join itself
with other
influences coming,
for the most
part, from
farther East. One of the few Egyptian words which have
come down into our language is ammonia. It is the name of
an alkali which was said to have been found near a certain
spot in the Libyan desert, where there was an Egyptian
temple to Zeus Ammon, and it will serve to remind us that
Alexander the Great must have been deeply under the
influence of the Egyptian priesthood when, in 332 B.C., after
his brilliant career of conquests, he went far out of his way
to visit this temple before founding the city of Alexandria.
We find, therefore—as might be expected—a strong Egyp-
tian element blending with what was Greek in the thoughts
and feelings that began to ferment in the more enterprising
Alexandrian bosoms. And that is not all. A third influence
was added. In the third century B.C. a certain capable ruler
of Alexandria invited a body of Egyptian Jews to translate
the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek. The Septuagint, as
it
was
called, was so
successful that Greek soon became a
recognized language of the Hebrew
religion. Thus, the
Greek version found its way into the synagogues of Pales-
tine, where it may well have been read byJesus ofNazareth.
Without making a study of the Septuagint, it is easy to
perceive how passionate Hebrew meanings were gradually
imported into the cold and clear-cut Greek words, until
114

Philosophy and Religion
classical Greek had grown slowly into
the
'Hellenistic'
Greek ofthe New Testament. Seeking for words to convey
such notions as 'sin', 'righteousness', 'defilement', 'abomi-
nation', 'ungodly', theJewish translators had to do the best
they could with noises which to Heraclitus and Plato had
implied something more
like
'folly',
'integrity',
'dirt',
'objectionable practice', 'ignorant', Any number of such
examples
could
be
found.
The
harmless
Greek word
'eidSlon'
(idol), which had formerly meant any sort of
mental image, including a mere mental fancy, suddenly
found itself selected from its fellows to be spit upon and
cast into outer darkness. 'Paradeisos', on the other hand—
the park of a Persian nobleman—was
spirited away,
as
though by the four Djinns of Arabian legend, first to the
Garden of Eden and then to the heavens.
It may well be
that in the Septuagint version of the Old Testament, more
than anywhere else,
is crystallized out for us that process
which went on in and about Alexandria for three or four
hundred years, and which remained almost unaffected by
the inclusion of the city within the Roman Empire. Lan-
guage never ceases growing, but an important document
such as this is like a cross-section of its stem. In it we can see
clearly what an enormous part that Alexandrian mingling
of Jewish, Egyptian, and Greek conceptions of the Al-
mighty has played in deterrnining the subtler part of the
words we use every day—in building up those delicate
associations of which few of us ever become fully con-
scious, but which we all instinctively bring into play when
we are speaking under the influence ofemotion.
And later, in the work ofa writer like Philo theJew, who
lived and wrote about a.d. 50, we can discern some of the
"5

Philosophy and Religion
religious activities which had followed the translation of
the Septuagint; how the Jew, with his instant expectation
of the Messiah, the Egyptian devotee, with his reverence
for Horus—the child of a virgin mother,
Isis—who died
and rose again as the sun-god Osiris, and the Greek, with
his elaborated Platonic doctrine, met together, speaking
Greek; how innumerable sects, ascetic and licentious, philo-
sophical and superstitious, wise and foolish, had been spring-
ing up and dying down all over the Alexandrian world
all ofthem, to whatever extravagant lengths they may have
carried their philosophies and their dreams, working un-
consciously at the long task of altering the meaning, the
emotional colour, the evocative power of common Greek
words. Concepts such as 'God', 'world',
'love',
'soul',
'life', 'death',
'spirit',
'self', and a hundred others were
first resolved by the chemical action upon them of similar
concepts from the minds of other nations and races, and
then they began to be built up anew and to take on the
form in which they are presented, as he learns to speak, to
the modern European child.
Greek philosophy had developed
in many
directions
since Plato's day. We hear of Cynics,
Sceptics, Epicureans,
Stoics, all ofwhich words originated as the names of differ-
ent schools of philosophy. The last two, whose doctrines
were to take such a firm hold on the educated classes of
imperial Rome, have given us one or two important words.
Apart from
their moral teachings, they appear to have
directed their philosophical inquiries more especially to the
point of contact between thoughts and things or,
as we
should say, between objective and subjective. 'Phantasia',
from which we havefantasy andfancy, was a popular word
116

Philosophy and Religion
with the Stoics, who gave it much of its modern meaning;
notion and comprehension are Cicero's translations of Stoic
terms; while image in the sense of
* mental image' and
spectre are Latin renderings of Epicurean expressions. Epi-
curus had founded his doctrines on those of Democritus,
and these last two words were employed by Cicero and
one of his
friends
in
discussing
that philosopher's odd
theory of perception. He had held that the surfaces of all
objects are continually throwing off 'images'—a kind of
films or husks which float about in space and at last pene-
trate to the mind through the pores of the body. Both the
Stoic
'phantasia' and
this Democritan word
'eid5lon',
which Cicero translated by 'imago', seem to have contri-
buted a part of their meaning to the later 'imaginatio',
from which, ofcourse, we have taken our imagination.
It was the Stoics, too, who gradually burdened the little
Greek word 'logos' with the weight of a whole meta-
physical theory of the relation between spirit and matter.
'Logos' in Greek had always meant both 'word' (an expressed
meaning) and the creative faculty in human beings—'Reason',
as it is often translated—which expresses itself by making and
using words. The Stoics were the first to identify this human
faculty with that divine Mind (Nous) which earlier Greek
philosophers had perceived as pervading the visible uni-
verse. They were the first to make the progressive incarna-
tion ofthought in audible sound a part ofthe creative work-
ing ofGod in the world; and it is to them accordingly, with
their deep sense of the divine significance of words and
their origin, that we owe the word etymology, the first half
ofwhich is composed ofa poetical Greek adjective meaning
'true'. Though he had never heard of Christianity, Philo,
"7

Philosophy and Religion
importing
into
the theory
a
certain
Semitic
awfulness,
actually called this mysterious 'logos' the
' only-begotten-
son'.
It must not be imagined that the majority of Alexan-
drian citizens were interested in these matters.
Israel and
Egypt resembled Greece in this, that they had in the first
place their inner religious traditions, and in the second their
stock of popular myth and legend. And just as, in Athens,
the average citizen had accepted the teachings of ordinary
Greek mythology, without knowing anything at all about
the thoughts of contemporary philosophy,
so was
it in
Alexandria, where the majority lived a life of easy-going
frivolity and dissipation, paying to the gods the regular
outward observances demanded by the calendar, and other-
wise not bothering to think much about them until they
were frightened or
ill. Throughout the course of history
the many have accepted,
as
far
as they were
able,
the
thoughts which have been made for them by the few in
the past, and the few have gone on constructing the opinion
ofthe future.
In Palestine Jesus of Nazareth lived and taught and died.
As the years passed by, an increasing number of sages and
religious teachers began to agree among themselves that
recendy something had actually occurred which had before
only been talked about or erroneously believed to have
occurred. Certain of the Jews, for instance, admitted that
their Messiah had now come and gone. Egyptians and fol-
lowers of the Egyptian cults were persuaded that a real
Horus had been born of a virgin, and had risen again as an
Osiris. Some of the more forward-looking among those
who had been initiated into the Mysteries felt that what had
118

Philosophy and Religion
so often been enacted dramatically within the sacred pre-
cincts had now taken place in a peculiar way on the great
stage ofthe world, this time not for a few, but for all to see.
A God had himselfdied in order to rise again to eternal life.
Thus, those who had not been initiated—the poorer classes,
most of the women, and the slaves—had a joyous feeling
that at last the Mysteries had been revealed, that 'many
things which were hid had been made plain'. And some
students ofPlatonic philosophy could admit that this might
be true, that henceforth those who could not rise to the con-
templation of the eternal in Nature might yet win immor-
tality by contemplating the life and death ofJesus. For they
could see in Christ one who had first taught in a new and
simpler way, and had then Himself demonstrated, a truth
which nearly every one of the Greek philosophers, includ-
ing Aristotle, had been trying to say all their lives—that, in
order to achieve immortality, it is necessary to 'die' to this
world of the senses and the appetites, and that he who thus
'dies' is already living in eternity during his bodily life and
will continue to do so after his bodily death. 'Whosoever
shall lose
his
life shall find
it.'
In the Christ the Logos of
Philo and his school had become incarnate in human form,
the Word had been made Flesh.
Such were some of the numerous ideas and emotions
which had become embedded in the Greek language by the
time
that, somewhere about
a hundred years
after His
death, the life of Christ was written by the four Evangelists
and others. Out of these ideas and emotions arose, in the
first place, the dogma and ritual of the Catholic Church,
and in the second place a great part ofthe ordinary thoughts
and
feelings and impulses of will which flourish in the
119

Philosophy and Religion
bosoms ofmodern Europeans and Americans.
Very early in its career the leaders of the infant Church
must have realized two things—firstly, that those who, like
the Gnostics, were passionately interested in philosophical
and mystical interpretations of the life of Christ, not only
differed very widely among themselves, but also often paid
little attention to that personal life ofJesus, as recorded in
the Gospels, whose sweetness was beginning to bind men
together with marvellous new
ties;
secondly,
that
the
simple and ignorant people to whom, according to the
Gospels, Jesus addressed Himselfalmost exclusively, would
be
quite
incapable of grasping
these
interpretations.
If
Christianity was to spread, it must be simplified. For these
reasons the leading spirits gradually set their faces more and
more rigidly against those long and laboriously evolved
ideas which had actually created the language of the Gos-
pels. And no doubt there were other reasons too: the most
shocking immorality was rampant everywhere, and
in
those days opinion and behaviour were more closely bound
up with one another. Moreover, in
all but the strongest
natures an extreme love of moral purity
is often accom-
panied by an extreme love ofexerting authority.
Therefore incredibly industrious Fathers busied them-
selves in editing and selecting from the literature and tradi-
tions of a hundred semi-Christian sects. Doctrines which
had taken a very strong hold on many imaginations were
accepted, given the orthodox stamp, and incorporated in
the canon; others were rejected, and, being pursued at first
with a mixture of genuine logic, misrepresentation, and
invective, and, as the Church grew stronger, with active
persecution, gradually vanished away or dwindled down to
120

Philosophy and Religion
obscure apocryphal manuscripts, some of which have only
been partially translated within the last few decades. Thus,
for more than ten centuries, creeds and dogmas,
to the
accompaniment
of immense
intellectual
and
physical
struggles, were petrified into ever clearer and harder forms.
Christianity became identified with Catholic doctrine, and,
soon after the Church's authority was backed by that ofthe
Roman Empire, any other form of it might be punished by
death. The stigma which
still
attaches
to
the ordinary
Greek word for 'choosing'
{heresy)
is a fair indication of
the zeal with which the early Popes and Bishops set about
expunging from
the
consciousness of Christendom
all
memory of its history and all understanding of its external
connections; while their success may be judged from the
fact that as late as the last century an Englishman of public
position who
should have openly
interpreted
the Old
Testament
as Origen,
for instance,
interpreted
it in the
third century, would have incurred serious disabilities.
Consequently it is not surprising if we have found our-
selves digging in somewhat unfamiliar places. Later on, the
Catholic outlook spanned the whole imagination of the
Middle Ages like the vaulted nave of a vast cathedral. By
laying bare some of the foundations of that outlook and
applying
to them a
little knowledge of the
histories of
words and their meanings, we can do something which we
could hardly do else but by a long and difficult study of the
arcana of the Dark Ages, their Neoplatonism, their mon-
astic traditions, their Schools, and their cults of the Virgin.
We can, in some degree, be present with our own imagin-
ations at the building of the cathedral. And this is worth
while, not only for its own sake, but because, as that huge
121

edifice slowly ruined, we filched its worn but shapely stones
and began to build up with them those bridges of feeling
which join us today to our husbands and our wives, our
children, our lovers, our friends.

Plato, following the doctrines of Timaeus and Pythagoras, taught
also a moral and intellectual system of doctrine, comprehending at
once the past, the present, and the future condition of man. Jesus
Christ divulged the sacred and eternal truths contained in these views
to mankind, and Christianity, in its abstract purity, became the exo-
teric expression ofthe esoteric doctrines of the poetry and wisdom of
antiquity. The incorporation of the Celtic nations with the exhausted
population of the south, impressed upon it the figure of the poetry
existing in their mythology and institutions. The result was a sum of
the action and reaction of all the causes included in it; for it may be
assumed as a maxim that no nation or religion can supersede any
other without incorporating into itself a portion of that which
it
supersedes. The abolition of personal and domestic slavery, and the
emancipation ofwomen from a great part of the degrading restraints
of antiquity, were among the consequences ofthese events.
.
.
. The freedom of women produced the poetry of sexual love.
Love became a religion, the idols of whose worship were ever pre-
sent.
It was as if the statues of Apollo and the Muses had been en-
dowed with life and motion, and had walked forth among their wor-
shippers; so that the earth became peopled by the inhabitants of a
diviner world. The familiar appearance and proceedings of life be-
came wonderful and heavenly, and a paradise was created as out of
the wrecks ofEden. And as this creation itself is poetry, so its creators
were poets; and language was the instrument of their art: Galeottofil

I\ puleius and other imperial writers have

of the

_a~ earlier centuries of the Roman Empire. In their
works the pomps and
frivolities of that decaying world
pass in procession before our eyes; the tenuous old Roman
gods and goddesses rub shoulders in the popular imagina-
tion, on the one hand, with powerful relics of the Egyptian
Mysteries, and on the other—already in the second century
—with full-blooded medieval witches and demons; while
the polite scepticism and graceful dissipation of the edu-
cated
raises
its eyebrows and shrugs
its shoulders
at the
credulous fervours ofChristians and their numerous fellow-
cranks. There are only one or two common English words
which throw any direct light on this period. Martyr, the
Greek word for a
' witness', and so 'a witness to the truth',
tells its story of the earlier days of the Church, as heresy of
the later. The name Constantinople has a double historical
significance. It bears the name of the first Roman emperor
who recognized Christianity as the established religion of
the empire, and
it marks the removal in a.d. 330 of the
imperial capital from Italy to the shores of the Bosphorus.
That removal foreshadowed the inevitable splitting up of
the Roman Empire into an eastern and a western half, a
schism which survives formally today in the difference be-
tween
the Greek Orthodox and
the Roman
Catholic
Church.
It may be called the starting-point of European
history.
Huge shadowy movements were taking place deep down
in the wills and imaginations of men.
Powerful move-
ments; for now the meanings and associations of all those
124

Devotion
Latin words which were subsequently to come into our
language in the various ways described in Chapter III were
being built up or altered, not only by outstanding figures
such as Saint Jerome and Saint Augustine, and the lawyer
Emperor Justinian, but also by insignificant Roman legion-
aries and barbarian private soldiers, by outlandish scholars
and studious, dreaming monks. In particular, an increasing
number of the profound and manifold concepts which had
been laboriously worked into the Greek language in the
manner suggested in the last chapter were gradually de-
canted,
either by actual
translation or by more indirect
methods, into Latin syllables. Thus, side by side with the
Septuagint,
there came into being the Vulgate,
a Latin
translation of the Old and New Testaments, finished by
Saint Jerome in a.d. 405, and still the received text of the
Roman Catholic Church. But it did not stand alone like the
Septuagint. Many volumes of ecclesiastical literature are
extant through which we could trace the gradual importa-
tion into the Latin language of the new meanings. For
example, at the end of the second century—no doubt with
the object of distmguishing the Christian Mystery ofincar-
nation, death, and rebirth from its many rivals—Tertullian
fixed the Latin 'sacramentum' as the proper translation of
'musterion' instead of'mysterium', which would probably
have disappeared altogether had not Jerome restored it to
partial use. Thus one word, as is often the case, split up into
two, sacrament remaining within the Church to
express,
among other things, part of the old technical meaning of
mystery, while
mystery
itself,
freed from one half of its
associations, moved outside and quickly grew wider and
vaguer. 'Passio', the Latin word for suffering, used in eccle-
i2f

Devotion
siastical literature for the death ofJesus on the cross, gradu-
ally extended in a similar way the scope ofits pregnant new
meaning, and we find already in Tertulhan a derivative
'compassio'. From
Latin,
largely through French,
such
new meanings found their way into English, and
it was
these, as we shall see, more than anything else which trans-
formed the country between the Norman Conquest and
the fifteenth century into something like the England which
we know today.
For if we omit the Dark Ages, and, turning suddenly
from the civilization of classical Greece and Rome,
raise
the curtain on,
say, thirteenth-century England, we are
struck by a remarkable transformation. An attempt has
been made in previous chapters to trace the general changes
of meaning in certain key-words of human thought and
feeling, such as God and love,
life and death, heaven and hell,
.
.
. When we reach medieval Europe, it is necessary to add
a new
class of key-word
altogether.
Let
us look
at
a
fifteenth-century English carol:
I sing ofa maiden
That is makeless; 1
King ofall kings
To her son she ches?
He came al so still
There his mother was,
As dew in April
Thatfalleth on the grass.
He came al so still
To his mother s hour,
1 Matchless.
2 Chose.
126

Devotion
As dew in April
Thatfalleth on theflour.
He came al so still
There his mother lay,
As dew in April
Thatfalleth on the spray.
Mother and maiden
Was never none but she;
Well may such a lady
Goddes mother be.
In such a poem we have once more a kind of cross-
section of the growth of European outlook. Between its
lines we seem to be able to hear, as in a dream, the mono-
tonous intonings of Egyptian priests, the quiet words of
Socrates in the Academy, and the alert speculative hum of
the Alexandrian world. It is so graceful that for the moment
it seems as though all these things, with all the pillages and
massacres and crucifixions and vast imperial achievements
of Rome, had been conspiring together merely to load the
homely old Teutonic word 'loaf-kneader' with new sem-
antic significance,
to transform
it into that mystery and
symbol in the imaginations ofmen, a lady.
The medieval lyric, as it gradually loses its exclusive pre-
occupation with ecclesiastical subjects, becomes more and
more concerned with woman, and concerned with her in a
new way. Through the poetry of Italy, where the Renais-
sance was
already
stirring,
the troubadour
literature of
France, and that strange 'Rose'
tradition which
is pre-
served to us in Chaucer's translation of the Roman de
la
Rose, there grew up during the thirteenth and fourteenth
12-J

Devotion
centuries a small special vocabulary defining the landmarks
in that new region of the imagination which the poets, and
even the
scholars, of Europe were just discovering; we
might call it the region of devotional love. Indeed,
it was
more than a vocabulary;
it developed at one time into a
sort of miniature mythology, for the various conflicting
elements in a lady's disposition which the lover had to
meet with and overcome were actually personified,
' Dan-
ger' being a kind of mixture of modesty and haughtiness
—an ill-omened creature whom 'Pity' or 'Mercy', if the
lover was fortunate, finally put to rout:
Alfounde they Daungerfor a tyme a lord,
Yet Pitee, thurgh his stronge gentle might
Foryaf
1 and made Mercy passen Ryght.
In these three lines from Chaucer's Legend of Good Women
the four Anglo-French words Danger,
Pity,
Gentle, and
Mercy are
all Latin terms whose forms had
altered, and
whose meanings had received the Christian stamp during
the Dark Ages. Pity comes from 'pietas' (compare piety);
gentle from
'gentilis' meaning 'of the same family' and
later 'ofnoble birth'; and mercy from 'merces', 'a reward',
then 'a reward in heaven for kindness displayed on earth'.
None of them—with the exception of mercy in
its theo-
logical sense—are known to have been used in English
before
the
thirteenth
century.
Anguish,
beauty,
bounty,
charity, comfort, compassion, courtesy,
delicate, devotion, grace,
honour,
humble,
passion,
patience,
peace,
purity,

are
further examples of this new vocabulary of tenderness
which came to us from Latin through Early French. Some

of them, such as charity, delicate, and passion, were probably
brought to England by the preaching
friars before
the
Conquest; others came with the devout Normans, and did
not develop a secular meaning until after they had reached
our shores
(devotion remaining purely theological until as
late as the sixteenth century); while yet a third class had
already been secularized by nimble spirits like Petrarch and
Ronsard a century or two before they reached us by the
Norman route along with more frivolous terms, amorous,
dainty, dalliance, debonair, delight, pleasure, pleasance, and the
like, in which there
is no particular reason to perceive a
strong ecclesiastical influence. All of them, apart from the
last group, are alike in that they started with a theological
meaning and subsequently developed an affectionate one
alongside of it. We may think ofthem as gifts presented to
the lyric lover by the Bride of Christ—well-chosen gifts;
for were they not the ardent creations of her own early
passion?
Thus, side by side with such lyrics as the carol quoted
above, we find in the Middle Ages charming little secular
poems almost indistinguishable from them in tone and
manner:
Sweet rose ofvertew and ofgentilness,
Delightsome lily ofeverie lustyness,
Richest in bountie and in bewtie clear,
And everie vertew that is wened dear,
Except onlie that ye are mercyless.
Into yourgarth this day I did pursew;
There saw Ijlowris thatfresh were ofhew;
Both white and red most lusty were to seene

And halesome herbis upon stalkisgreene;
Yet leafnorjlowrfind could I none ofrew.
I doubt that Merche, with his cauld blastis keene,
Has slain thisgentil herb, that I ofimene;
Whose piteous death does to my heart suchpaine
That I would make to plant his root againe,—
So comforting his leavis unto me bene.
And along with the influx of Anglo-French words further
semantic changes were, of course, taking place in the more
important Old English words. If there are occasions when
a single word seems to throw more light on the workings
ofmen's minds than a whole volume of history or a whole
page of contemporary literature, the Middle English love-
longing is certainly one of them.
A new element had entered into human relationships, for
which perhaps the best name that can be found is
' tender-
ness'. And so—at any rate in the world of imagination
children as well as women gradually became the objects of
a new solicitude. We do not find in all literature prior to
the Middle Ages quite that pathetic sense ofchildhood which
Chaucer has expressed so delicately in the story of Ugolino
ofPisa in his Monk's Tale:
But litel out ofPize stant1 a tour
In whiche tour inprisounput was he,
And with hym been his litel children three,
The eldest scarslyfyj"yeer was ofage.

Quotations
are
scarcely needed
to
intimate how
such
colourless words
as
little—here sentimentally repeated
children, and even cruelty, had gradually been laden with
fresh emotional significance by the Roman Church's wor-
ship of the baby Jesus and its popular expression in carol
and drama. We
still have
a few examples of these old
Nativity Plays, from the individual scenes of which we
take
the word pageant, and
about
the same time
that
Chaucer wrote we know that the tailors of Coventry com-
posed and sang the beautiful carol which begins:
Lully, lullay, thou little tiny Child,
By by lully, lullay.
Herod the King
In his raging
Charged he hath this day
His men ofmight
In his own sight
All young children to slay.

Thus, when Tindale and Coverdale came to make their
translations ofthe Bible in the sixteenth century, they found
ready
to
their hand a vocabulary of feeling which had
indeed been drawn in the first place from the austerities of
the religious hfe, but which had in many cases acquired
warmer and more human echoes by having been applied to
secular
uses. And just
as
lyrical devotion
to
the Virgin
Mary and to the infant Jesus had helped to evolve a voca-
bulary which could express, and thus partly create, a senti-
ment of tenderness towards all women and young children,
so we seem to
feel the warmth of human affection, as
it
were, reflected back into religious emotion in such crea-
131

Devotion
tions
as Coverdale's lovingkindness and tender mercy, Tin-
dale's
long-suffering,
mercifulness, peacemaker, and
beautiful
(for it was he who brought this word into general use), and
in many of the majestically simple phrases of the Author-
ised Version.
In tracing the elements ofmodern consciousness through
the history ofwords in this way, there is one mistake which
it is especially important to avoid, and that is the mistake of
over-simplification. For instance, just as it is true that the
shade of feeling which we call 'tenderness' can be traced
back to the literature of the Middle Ages, and that from
there we can trace it farther back still, through the Mario-
latry of the Roman Church to the opening chapters of the
Luke Gospel, and
so, maybe,
to
the old Egyptian
Isis-
worship and the philosophy of Plato, so it
is also true that
it can be understood more perfectly and
felt more fully
when we have thus unravelled
it. But not to realize that
with the appearance of a poetic tradition which can give
rise to such a poem as 'I sing of a maiden' something quite
new,
something
with no
perceptible
historical
origin,
enters into humanity, is to cultivate a deaf ear to literature,
and to mistake quite as grievously both the method and the
object ofunderstanding history.
If medieval Europe is cut off from Greece and Rome by
her imaginative conception of women, she is cut off even
more completely by her abstention from slavery. Of this
development, thus negatively stated, there are few, if any,
signs in our language; but traces are by no means wanting
of a certain deeper and more interior change which must
have underlain the other two. Perhaps
it can best be ex-
pressed
as a new consciousness of the individual human
132

Devotion
soul. On the one hand the sense of its independent being
and
activity, of bottomless
depths and
soaring
heights
within it, to be explored in fear and trembling or with hope
and joy—with delight and
mirth, or with agony,
anguish,
despair, repentance—and on the other hand that feeling of its
being an inner world, which has since developed so fully
that this book, for example, has fallen naturally into two
halves.
In this connection it is particularly interesting to note the
appearance of conscience in the thirteenth century. In classi-
cal times the Latin 'conscientia' seems to have meant some-
thing more
like 'consciousness' or 'knowledge';
it was
generally qualified by some other word ('virtutum, viti-
orum'—'consciousness of virtues, of vices,'
.
.
.), and
its
termination, similar to that of science,
intelligence,
.
.
. sug-
gests that it was conceived of by the Romans more as a
general, abstract quality, which one would partake of, but
not actually possess—just as one has knowledge or happi-
ness, but not
'a knowledge'
or
'a happiness'. Used in
ecclesiastical Latin and later in English, conscience seems to
have grown more and more real, until at last it became that
semi-personified and perfectly private mentor whom we
are inclined to mean today when we speak of
' my con-
science' or 'his conscience'.
The movement
towards
'individualism',
like many
other phenomena of modern
civilization,
has long ago
shifted its centre ofgravity outside the walls ofthe Church.
Once it was felt as the peculiar glory of the Christian reli-
gion. In the Dark Ages heresies which attempted to explain
away the significant paradox ofChrist's simultaneous divin-
ity and humanity were hunted down with
the utmost
i33

Devotion
rigour, and it is probable that a vivid sense ofthe dignity of
the individual human soul was at the bottom of a good
many actions which now seem to us like the very stultifica-
tion of such a conviction. This great inner world of con-
sciousness, we may suppose, which each individual was
now
felt to control in some measure for himself, was a
thing to fear as well as to respect.
It gave to every single
soul almost infinite potentialities, for evil as well as good;
and even the wisest heads seem to have felt that civilization
could only be held together as long as all these souls main-
tained a certain uniformity of pattern. Thus, while the in-
fluence of Christianity had ensured to all men—not merely
to
a
small slave-owning
class—a modicum of personal
liberty, it deprived them in the same breath of that dearest
of all possessions, freedom of thought. The grim meaning
gradually acquired by the Latin word Inquisition, meaning
an 'inquiry', still signifies to us the ruthless pains that were
now taken, for the first time in the world's history, to pry
into and endeavour to control that private thinking life of
men which had suddenly acquired such a vast importance
in their eyes. The
still grimmer auto-da-fe began life as a
Spanish phrase meaning simply an 'act of faith'.
It seems remarkable to us
that, in spite of this active
discouragement
of
independent
thinking,
the
Dark
and Middle Ages were, beyond
dispute,
the
cradle of
European philosophy. Perhaps this was because men did
not yet feel the need for such independence. The leading
quality of medieval thought was
its
receptiveness, and
towards the end of its life it seems to have become almost
conscious of this itself; for it
is hardly possible to open a

volume of Chaucer without lighting on some half-respect-
ful, half-ironical reference to 'olde clerkes' or 'olde bokes'.
But the profound respect in which the written word had
been held throughout the Middle Ages survives in many
other curious ways as well. We still use the word authority
in its two separate meanings of 'a quotation from a book'
and 'the power of controlling'. Of these the first meaning
is the older, and from the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries
it may almost be said to have included the latter within it.
Again, our word glamour, a later form o£gramarye, suggests
—or suggested, before
it was debauched by Hollywood
and the popular press—an almost mystical reverence for the
'grammar' which—along with most of the other branches
ofmedieval learning—was derived entirely from the works
of Aristotle. The popularity and general use of term, which
began
life
as
a
subtle
technicality of Aristotelian
logic,
reminds
us
again of the
universal study of that writer
in the Middle
Ages,
and
spice—a
corrupted
form
of
'species'—is but another indication of the way in which
the jargon of classical philosophy crept into their everyday
thought.
The change from Greek and Roman civilization to the
civilization of modern Europe is often represented as hav-
ing been more abrupt than it really was. We have deduced
some of the intermediate stages in the alterations of feeling.
In the world ofthought there are actual written documents
for our information, philosophical
treatises and counter-
treatises, which, by revealing to us the very moment of
impact, enable us to trace more easily the reverberation of
thought from mind to mind. Not so long after the break up

as the Germanic
Kaiser,
the great medieval
1 Schools', ofwhich the most famous was at Paris, began to
arise out of the
traditions of monastic
learning.
Their
classical library apparently consisted of one Platonic dia-
logue and two or three works of Aristotle,
all of them
translated; but the authority of these translations was abso-
lute. At first Plato was considered the greater 'authority',
but from the beginning ofthe thirteenth century it seems to
have been accepted almost as a matter ofcourse that the one
great object of all philosophy for all time was the harmon-
ization of Aristotelian
logic and
Catholic dogma. But
though the Aristotelian method (as they understood it) was
all in all, the actual Platonic system, with the help ofNeo-
platonism and the Mystics, lingered in sufficient strength to
divide medieval philosophy for several hundred years into
two rival camps. The one party, known as 'Realists', held
with Plato that 'ideas'—now usually called universals—had
existed before, and could exist quite apart from, things;
while the
' Nominalists' held that universals had no separate
or previous
existence. But
as time passed, many of the
Nominalists went farther
still, maintaining that these uni-
versals did not exist at all, that they were mere intellectual
abstractions or classifications made by the human mind—in
fact 'ideas' in the sense in which, owing to them, we use the
word today. One of the reasons—perhaps the chief reason
—why so many Schoolmen carried Aristotle beyond him-
selfin this way is a particularly interesting one.
Reference has already been made to the wave of Arabic
civilization which surged into Europe early in the Dark
Ages. It was a civilization in every sense of the word; for in

the ninth century learning had developed under the Caliphs
ofBaghdad to a degree unparalleled elsewhere in the world,
and rapprochements between the two races and civilizations,
which had already begun in the world ofphilosophy, were
soon strengthened and increased by those great medieval
experiments, the Crusades. 1 Now Arabic scholars were, if
anything, more enthusiastic Aristotelians than the scholars
of Europe. The curious word arabesque, and the fact that
words like algebra, cipher, zero, and some others to be men-
tioned in the next chapter, are among the few Arabic words
which reached our language before the fourteenth century,
are both symptomatic of a certain peculiarity of the Arabic
mind which we may perhaps call the tendency to abstrac-
tion. The Arab seems to have possessed something of that
combination of materialism on the one hand and excessive
intellectual abstraction on the other which we have already
noticed in the later stages of Roman mythology. Just as he
made Mohammedanism out oftheJewish sacred traditions,
so he made Nominalism out of Greek philosophy. The in-
fluence upon Christian thought ofgreat Arabic philosophers
like Averroes and Avicenna is one of the most astonishing
1 More direct products of the Crusades may be found in our language in
the words azure, cotton, orange, saffron, scarlet, sugar, and damask
(from the
town of Damascus), all ofwhich come to us either from Arabic or, through
Arabic, from some Oriental language. Miscreant (misbeliever) was applied to
the Mohammedans by the French Crusaders. Assassin (hashish-eaters) was
used by the Christians to describe the secret murderers sent out by the Old
Man of the Mountains against their leaders, because they used to intoxicate
themselves with hashish before the interview. Hazard—originally a game
played with dice—has been traced to Asart, the name of a castle in Palestine,
during the siege of which it is said to have been invented; and termagant was
first used in medieval romances as the name of one of the idols which the
Saracens were supposed to worship.

chapters in its history. But it is not difficult to see how it
occurred. The learning of the Middle Ages was founded
entirely on translations, and this was an activity in which,
as far as Aristotle's works were concerned, the Arabs had
got in first. According to Renan, some of the current ver-
sions of Aristotle were 'Latin translations from a Hebrew
translation of a Commentary of Averroes made on an
Arabic
translation of a
Syriac
translation of a
Greek
text'.
To the Popes and those who had the power and interest
of the Church most at heart the problem appeared in quite
a
different
light.
It was a question of steering Christian
dogma between the Scylla ofpantheism and the Charybdis
of materialism and its logical conclusion, scepticism. Thus,
throughout the history of Scholasticism we have to do with
a
sort
of
triangle
of
intellectual
forces:
Realism
and
Nominalism fighting a five hundred years' war, and the
Church, in its official capacity, anxiously endeavouring to
hold the balance between them. One wonders whether the
three parties to this ancient dispute may not have found
symbolic expression in Tweedledum, Tweedledee, and the
'Monstrous Crow' of nursery legend. But
it
is no
dis-
paragement of the intellects of that day to say that to us the
chief interest of their polemics lies in the many new and
accurate instruments of thought with which they provided
us. The common word accident is an excellent example. We
use it every day without realizing that it was only imported
from Latin by the indefatigable efforts of the Schoolmen to
reconcile the doctrine of Realism with the Catholic dogma
of Transubstantiation. The accidents, when they first came
into the English language, meant that part of the sacred
i 38

bread and wine which remained after the substance had been
transmuted into the body and blood of Christ.
On the whole it is a safe rule to assume that those who
speak most contemptuously of such thinkers
as Thomas
Aquinas and Duns Scotus are the nearest modern represen-
tatives of their own idea of what these Schoolmen were;
that is to say, they are those whose imaginations are most
completely imprisoned within the intellectual horizon of
the passing
age. Much fun has been made of medieval
philosophy for discussing such matters as how many angels
can stand on the point of a needle, and whether Christ
could have performed His cosmic mission equally well if
He had been incarnated as a pea instead of as a man. The
growth of a rudimentary historical sense has,
it
is
true,
made
it fashionable lately to take these ancient thinkers
rather more seriously, but
it
is
still rare to find a philo-
sopher or a psychologist who fully comprehends that he is
consuming the
fruits of this long, agonizing struggle to
state the exact relation between spirit and matter, every
time he uses such key-words of thought as absolute, actual,
attribute, cause, concept, deduction,
essence, existence,
intellect,
intelligence,
intention,
intuition,
motive,
potential,
predicate,
substance, tendency, transcend; abstract and concrete, entity and
identity, matter and form, quality and quantity, objective and
subjective, real and ideal, general, special and species, particular,
individual, and universal. 'Free will'
is the translation of a
Latin phrase first used by a Church Father, and
' argumen-
tum ad hominem' is an example ofa scholastic idiom which
has remained untranslated. Many of these words, it is true,
are in the first instance Latin translations of Greek terms
introduced by pagan writers before the days of the School-

men; some, like quality and species, by Cicero himself, and
others, like accident, actual, and essence, by later Latin writers
such as Quintilian or Macrobius. But
it must be remem-
bered that, even in these cases, the words, as we use them
today,
are
not
mere
translations. By
their
earnest and
lengthy discussions the Schoolmen were all the time defin-
ing more strictly the meanings of these and of many other
words already in use, and so adapting them to the European
brain that in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries it was
an easy matter for the lawyers and for popular writers like
Chaucer and Wyclif to stamp them with the authentic
genius of the English language and turn them into current
coin. 1 Nobody who understands the amount of pain and
energy which go to the creation of new instruments of
thought can feel anything but respect for the philosophy of
the Middle Ages.
Ifthe philosophy ofthe Middle Ages is based on the logic
of Aristotle, their science can be traced rather to the Greek
thought of pre-Aristotelian times. For authority
it relied
very largely on a single dialogue of Plato, to which may be
added Latin translations of a small part ofHippocrates, and
of his post-Christian successor and interpreter, Galen. But
the way in which its terms have entered right into the heart
of our language is proof enough that this medieval science
arose, not merely from blind subservience to tradition, but
also from an actual survival of the kind of feeling, the kind
of outlook which, ages ago, had created the tradition. In

spite of that strong and growing sense of the individual
soul, man was not yet felt, either physically or psychically,
to be isolated from his surroundings in the way that he is
today. Conversely his mind and soul were not felt to be
imprisoned within, and dependent upon, his body. Intel-
lectual classifications were accordingly less dry and clear,
and science—that general speculative activity which a later
age has split up into such categories as astronomy, physics,
chemistry, physiology, psychology,
.
.
.—was as yet almost
an undivided whole. Common words like ascendant, aspect,
atmosphere, choleric, common sense, complexion, consider, cordial,
disaster, disposition, distemper, ether, hearty, humour, humorous,
indisposed,
influence, jovial,
lunatic,
melancholy,
mercurial,
phlegmatic, predominant,
sanguine, saturnine, spirited, temper,
temperament, with
heart, liver, spleen, and stomach in their
psychological sense, most of which retained their original
and literal meanings down to the fourteenth century, give us
more than a glimpse into the relations between body, soul,
and cosmos,
as they were
felt by the medieval scientist.
Thus, the physical body was said to contain four humours
(Latin 'humor', 'moisture')
blood, phlegm,
bile or choler,
and black bile (melancholy)—which last had its seat in the
hypochondria. Not only diseases, or distempers, but qualities
of character were intimately connected with the proper
'mixture' (Latin 'temperamentum') of these humours, just
as modern medical theory sees a connection between the
character and the
glands. Thus,
a man might be good
humoured or bad humoured; he might have a good temper or a
bad temper; and according to which humour predominated
in his temperament or complexion, he was choleric, melancholy,
phlegmatic, or sanguine. His character depended on other

things
as well;
for the medieval
scientist believed with
Hippocrates
that
the
arteries
of
the
body
were
ducts
through which there flowed, not blood, but three different
kinds of ether (Greek
'aither',
'the upper
air') or
spirits
(Latin
'spiritus',
'breath',
'life'),
viz. the animal1
(Latin
'aninia', 'soul'), the vital, and the natural. But the stars and
the planets were also living bodies; they were composed of
that
'fifth
essence'
or
quintessence, which was
likewise
latent in all terrestrial things, so that the character and the
fate of men were
determined by
the
influences
(Latin
'influere', 'to flow in') which came from them. The Earth
had its atmosphere (a kind of breath which it exhaled from
itself); the Moon, which was regarded as a planet, had a
special connection with lunacy, and according as the planet
Jupiter, or
Saturn, or Mercury was predominant or in the
ascendant in the general disposition of stars at a man's birth,
he would be jovial, saturnine, or mercurial. Finally, things or
persons which were susceptible to the same influences, or
which influenced each other in this occult way, were said to
be in sympathy or sympathetic.

alchemist's word,
corning from
the Latin
'testa', an earthen pot in which the alchemist made his
alloys. The same word was once used as a slang term for

alembic, alkali, elixir, and tartar. The last five, together with
the word alchemy itself, all come to us from Arabic, and are
evidence ofthe fact that the Arabs ofthe Dark Ages, besides
being philosophers, were the fathers of modern chemistry.
It was, indeed, they who firstjoined the study ofchemistry
to the practice of medicine, and thus initiated a science of
drugs. Moreover, that old 'humoral' pathology which has
shaped so many ofour conceptions ofhuman character—in
so far as it was based on ancient authority and tradition
came from Hippocrates to Europe, for the most part not
directly, but by way ofBaghdad and Spain.
The more intimate and indispensable such conceptions
are, the more effort does
it require from the twentieth-
century imagination to realize how they have grown up.
It is so difficult, even when we are reading the old books
themselves, to blot out from our consciousness the different
meanings which have since gathered round the words.
If,
however, we can succeed in doing this, we cannot but be
struck by the odd nature of the change which they have all
undergone. When we reflect on the history ofsuch notions
as humour,
influence,
melancholy,
temper, and
the
rest,
it
seems for the moment as though some invisible sorcerer
had been
conjuring them
all
inside
ourselves—sucking
them away from the planets, away from the outside world,
away from our own warm flesh and blood, down into the
shadowy realm of thoughts and feelings. There they

Philosophy, alchemy, and mathematics were not the
only branches of learning in which the Arabs had
excelled. The appearance in English of such words
as azimuth, nadir, and zenith towards the end of the four-
teenth century suggests among other things that the think-
ing of this Syrian race contributed in no small degree to the
rise in Europe of the new astronomy. These three Arabic
words (two of them for the first time in English) are to be
found in Chaucer's Treatise on the Astrolabe, written in 13 91
for the instruction of his little son, 'Lowis'; and this inter-
esting document contains many other words also for which
the Oxford Dictionary does not give any earlier quotation,
such as almanac,
ecliptic, equinox, equator, horizon,
latitude,
longitude,
meridian, minute (meaning one-sixtieth of a de-
gree), while zodiac was used by Gower a few years before.
Such words show us that the Europe of the Dark Ages
had been experiencing once more what the ancient scien-
tists had known. Its learned men had been marking down
recurrences of natural phenomena and orientating them-
144

Experiment
selves on the earth by dividing its face up into imaginary
rings and segments. For such purposes they had found
Latin and Greek terms ready to their hand, and the survival
of the Greek zodiac reminds us that they had, moreover,
adopted the ancient system of mapping out the heavens
into twelve 'signs'. When, therefore, we find three Arabic
words among these relics of classical wisdom, we need not
be surprised to see that they express something which the
ancients had, apparently, never felt the need of expressing
—that is, an abstracted geometrical way ofmapping out the
visible heavens. These are conceived of as a vast sphere
encircling the earth; the zenith and the nadir are its poles,
while the azimuths are meridians ofcelestial longitude.
It
is probable that, with the use of these words, there
came for the first time into the consciousness of man the
possibility of seeing himself purely as a solid object situated
among solid objects. Of course, the Arab astronomer ofthe
Dark and Middle Ages
still saw the earth
as the centre
round which the universe revolved, and he would no more
have dreamed ofdoubting the 'astral' quality ofthe planets
than the schoolmaster of today who instructs his pupils to
write down 'Let #=20 oranges' doubts whether oranges
have any taste. Nevertheless we may feel pretty sure that
those minds which were apparently the
first to
tliink of
cutting up the sky without reference to the constellations,
and which could, moreover, develop so fully the great and
novel system of abstraction which they called algebra, did
their part in bringing about that extraordinary revolution
in astronomical thought which is associated with the name
of Copernicus. It is true that the astronomy of Plato's time
had been intimately connected with arithmetic and geo-
H5

Experiment
metry;
but
Plato's 'number' and
his geometry do not
appear to have been quite the abstract sciences which these
things are today. What we call their 'laws' seem to have
been felt, not as intellectual deductions, but rather as real
activities of soul—that human soul which, as we saw, the
philosopher could not yet feel to be wholly separate from a
larger world Soul, or planetary Soul. The Zodiacal signs,
for instance, had been as much, if not more, classifications
of this Soul as they had been sections of space. The word
comes from the Greek 'zodion', a
little animal, and not
only was every sign distinguished by a constellation, of
which the majority were associated with some beast, but
human character and human destiny were believed to be
bound up inextricably with the position of the sun and the
planets among these signs.
If, therefore, there
is any truth in the belief of the old
Greek philosophers and ofsome modern historians that the
study of mathematics has its origin in the observed move-
ments of the stars, the progress is of the same nature as that
which we noticed at the end of the last chapter.
Is it too
fanciful to picture to ourselves how, drawn into the minds
of a few men, the relative positions and movements of the
stars gradually developed a more and more independent
life there until, with the rise in Europe first oftrigonometry
and then of algebra, they detached themselves from the
outside world altogether? And then by a few great men
like Copernicus, Kepler,
Galileo, Newton, these abstract
mathematics were re-fitted to the
stars which had given
them birth, and the result was that cosmogony of infinite
spaces and a tiny earth in which our imaginations roam
today? When the Aryan imagination had at last succeeded
146

Experiment
in so detaching its 'ideas' about the phenomena of the uni-
verse that these could be 'played with', as mathematicians
say, in the form of an equation, then, no doubt,
it was a
fairly easy matter to turn them inside out.
The alterations wrought in the meanings ofmany of our
common words by this revolution of physical outlook are
not difficult to perceive and yet not easy to realize. As the
discoveries ofKepler and Galileo slowly filtered through to
the popular consciousness,
first of all simple words like
atmosphere, down, earth, planet, sky, space, sphere, star, up,

underwent a profound yet subtle semantic change. And
then, in the eighteenth century,
as Newton's discoveries
became more widely known, further alterations took place.
Weight, 1 for instance, acquired a new significance, differing
from mass, which also changed, having formerly meant
simply a lump ofmatter.
2 Gravity,
3 (from the Latin 'gravi-
tas' 'heaviness') took on its great new meaning, and the
new words gravitation and gravitate were formed, the latter
being soon adapted to metaphorical uses. If we cared to
examine them closely enough, we should probably find
that from this point a certain change of meaning gradually
spread over all words containing the notion of attraction,
or ideas closely related to it. The twin phenomena ofgravi-
1 'Heaviness or weight is not here considered,

quality, whereby condensed bodies do of themselves tend downwards; but
rather as being an affection whereby they may be measured. And in this
sense Aristotle himself referres
it amongst the other species of quantity, as
having the same proper essence, which
is to be compounded of integrall
parts. So a pound doth consist of ounces.

tation and magnetism, contemplated by most of us at an
early age, and impalpably present in the meanings of so
many of the words we hear spoken around us, make the
conception of one lifeless body acting on another from a
distance seem easy and familiar. 1 But the very word attrac-
tion (from the Latin 'ad-trahere',
'to draw' or 'drag to-
wards') may well serve to remind us that until the dis-
covery of gravitation this conception must have been prac-
tically beyond the range of human intellection. There was
formerly no half-way house in the imagination between
actual dragging or pushing and forces emanating from a
living being, such as love or hate, human or divine, or those
'influences' of the
stars which have already been men-
tioned.
A good illustration of this fact—and one which takes us
back again to the seventeenth century—is the word law.
The Latin 'lex' was first applied to natural phenomena by
Bacon. Later in the century law was used in the same sense,
but
it did not then mean quite what
it does today. The
'laws of Nature' were conceived of by those who
first
1 To
the ordinary, untrained imagination. Philosophers and
scientists,
however, have continued to boggle at this notion of action at a distance.
Thus Leibnitz, shortly after Newton published his discovery: "Tis also a
supernatural thing that bodies should attract one another at a distance without
any intermediate means.' And Huxley in 1886, on the terms atom and force:
'As real entities, having an objective existence, an indivisible particle which
nevertheless occupies space is surely inconceivable; And with respect to the
operation of that atom, where it is not, by the aid of a "force" resident in
nothingness, I am as little able to imagine it as I fancy anyone else is.' Hence
the invention of a hypothetical ether, in order that space might be supposed
filled with a continuum ofinfinitely attenuated matter (p. 160). In the world
of scientific theory the question of action at a distance is still a fairly appetiz-
ing bone ofcontention.
148

Experiment
spoke ofthem as present commands of God. It is noticeable
that we still speak of Nature 'obeying' these laws, though
we really think of them now rather as abstract principles
logical deductions of our own which we have arrived at by
observation and experiment.
Some account of Francis Bacon's general influence, as a
writer, on our language has already been given in Chapter
IV. His influence on thought was far greater, for he was in
some sense the moving spirit of that intellectual revolution
which began to sweep over Europe in the sixteenth cen-
tury. It was a revolution comparable in many ways to the
change inaugurated by Aristotle twenty centuries earlier,
and there
is accordingly much in Bacon's work that re-
minds us of the Greek philosopher. To begin with, he was
thoroughly dissatisfied with the whole method of thought
as he found it in his day, and, like Aristotle, he strove first
of all to effect a reformation in this. Aristotle had written
the Organum—that is to say, the 'Instrument' (ofThought)
—and Bacon intended his Novum Organum to go one step
farther. He proclaimed himself satisfied with
Aristotle's
legacy—the
prevailing
logical
system of syllogism and
deduction—as far as it went. Given the 'premises',
it was
the correct line of further discovery. What he questioned
was the Scholastic premises themselves, and he propounded
accordingly a new and surer method of establishing fresh
ones. It is known as the 'inductive method'. This is not the
place to expound Bacon's logical system, and it will suffice
that it was based on an extensive and, above all, a systematic
observation ofNature herself. Aristotle had indeed (though
the Schoolmen had nearly forgotten it) pointed the way to
such an observation, but it was left for Bacon to try and
149

Experiment
construct a prejudice-proof system of arranging and classi-
fying the results. These instances, as they were called, were,
on the one hand, to be manufactured by means of experi-
ment, and on the other to be arranged and weeded out
according to their significance. The word crucial comes to
us from Bacon's Latin phrase 'instantia crucis'—the crucial
instance—which,
like
a
sign-post,
decided between two
rival hypotheses by proving one and disproving the other
;
and it may be said that he endeavoured, but failed, to alter
the meaning of axiom itselffrom
' a self-evident proposition'
to
'a proposition established by the method of experi-
mental induction'.
Once more men turned the light of their curiosity upon
the stubborn phenomena ofthe outside world, and as it was
Aristotle's works in which we first found the Greek ana-
tomy, 'cutting up', so
it
is Bacon who
first uses dissection
(from the Latin for the same thing) in its modern technical
meaning. After an interval ofabout 1,500 years, the weigh-
ing, measuring, examining, and cutting up had now begun
again, and they have gone on ever since. How far Francis
Bacon was responsible for the form subsequently taken by
scientific thought will probably remain a matter of dispute.
His views on ecclesiastical authority, on Scholastic philo-
sophy, on Aristotle, on the Alchemists, certainly suggest
that he possessed what the nineteenth century has called the
'scientific attitude'
to an extent which distinguishes him
startlingly from any previous
or contemporary
writer;
acid, hydraulic, and suction are among the words first found
in his pages; but, above
all,
his consciousness of greater
changes afoot is manifested linguistically in such things as
his use of the words progressive and retrograde in an historical
150

Experiment
sense unknown, as we shall see, to the majority of thinkers
until the middle of the eighteenth century, or his equally
innovating distinction between ancient and modern. A marked
increase over the second quarter of the seventeenth century
in the number of words expressing the notion of doubt,
such
as dubious
(used of opinions),
dubiousness,
dubitable,
sceptic,
sceptical,
sceptically,
scepticism,
scepticity,
scepticize,
compares with an increase of only one or two during the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. And at about the same
time the words curious, curiosity, and inquisitive seem to have
lost the air of pious disapproval which they had previously
carried with them when used to express the love ofinquiry.
How much of this is due to novel combinations, such as 'a
natural curiosity and inquisitive appetite', which we find in
Bacon's Advancement ofLearning} We cannot say. There are
symptoms of the coming metamorphosis already, before
his time, in the appearance in English of the sixteenth cen-
tury of such significant new terms
as analyse,
distinguish,
investigate, together with the semantic change of observe
from
'to obey a
rule', or
'to inspect auguries'
into
its
modern meaning, and similar changes in the case of experi-
ment and experimental. It is impossible to prove these things.
As with Aristotle, so with Bacon,
it
is impossible to say
whether his own intellectual volume displaced the great
wave or whether he merely rose upon its early crest.
There are other influences, too, that must be taken into
account. Discovery
(it was a new word) was in the very air
of sixteenth-century England. From the West came tidings
ofa new world; from the East news yet more marvellous of
an old one; and the rebirth of Science was, in its infancy,
but a single aspect of that larger Renaissance which played
151

Experiment
such an important part in moulding the subsequent life and
outlook of Europe. Italy had felt the shock
first, and we
have a special group ofwords in our language to remind us
of the visual arts in which the new impulse drove her to
excel. Cameo, cupola, fresco, and model all reached us in the
sixteenth century from or through the Italian, and the next
saw the arrival of attitude, bust, chiaroscuro, dado, dome, fili-
gree, intaglio, mezzotinto, and pastel. If these are of a some-
what technical nature, words like antic, canto, capriole, galli-
gaskins, sonnet, and stanza build a bridge in the imagination
from Renaissance Italy to Tudor England, and ducat, incar-
nadine, and madonna are three Italian words with pleasant
Shakespearian associations. They remind us, too, that by
the time the Renaissance reached England it was already in
full swing. No wonder the literary world was swept off its
feet. First-hand acquaintance with the works of Classical
writers
gradually
substituted an
affectionate,
an almost
passionate, familiarity for that religious awe with which the
Middle Ages had honoured their garbled translations. One
of the first results—an immediate and violent intellectual
revolt against the Schoolmen and all things connected with
them—is faithfully preserved to us in the unenviable im-
mortality achieved about this time by the luckless Duns
Scotus, whose patronymic has given us dunce. The history
of the word conceit, which in Chaucer merely meant 'any-
thing conceived', tells its tale of the wild, undiscrirninating
rush after elegance ofthought and diction. By Shakespeare's
time the tasteless habit of piling fanciful conceit upon con-
ceit had already become
a thing
to parody,
the merest
affectation of wit, and so the word lives today chiefly as a
synonym for personal vanity, the language having been
752

Experiment
obliged by its degradation to re-borrow the Latin original
'conceptus' in the more exact form of concept.
It can readily be imagined that the restless activity which
these
little symptoms betoken had a remarkable effect in
altering, developing, and indeed modernizing, the English
vocabulary. The genius of the language sprouted and bur-
geoned in the genial warmth of Elizabethan and Jacobean
fancy, and—most effective of all—it passed through the fire
of Shakespeare's imagination. There is an unobtrusiveness
about
Shakespeare's enormous
influence on
his
native
tongue which sometimes recalls the records of his private
life. This is no doubt partly due to the very popularity of
his plays, which has preserved the direct influence in every
age. Where the word which he employs is a new one, it has
usually become so common in the course of years that we
find it hard to conceive ofthe time when it was not. Where
it is a meaning or a shade of meaning which he has added,
as likely as not that very shade was the one most familiar to
our own childhood before we had ever read a line of his
poetry. Phrases and whole lines from the plays and sonnets
are as much a part of the English vocabulary as individual
words. Such sue pitched battle, play on words, give him his due,
well on your way, too much ofa good thing, to the manner born,
the glass offashion, snapper-up of unconsidered
trifles, more
honoured in the breach than the observance,
.
.
. The influence
of such a mind on the language in which it expresses itself
can only be compared to the effect ofhigh temperatures on
solid matter. As imagination bodies forth the forms of
things unknown, each molecule ofsuggestiveness contained
in each word gains a mysterious freedom from its neigh-
bours; the old images move to and fro distinctly in the
i53

Experiment
listener's fancy, and when the sound has died away, not
merely the shape, but what seemed to be the very substance
ofthe word has been readjusted.
Examples are found readily enough with the help of a
volume of Shakespeare and the Oxford Dictionary. As to
new words themselves, it has been said that there are more
in Shakespeare's plays than in
all the rest of the English
poets put together. Advantageous, amazement, critic and criti-
cal,
dishearten,
dwindle, generous,
invulnerable,
majestic,
ob-
scene, pedant, pious, radiance, reliance, and sanctimonious are a
few examples, but
it
is
still more interesting to trace the
subtler part of his influence. As an instance ofwhat we may
call his literary alertness let us take the word propagate. It is
not found in English before 1570, and is thus a new word in
Shakespeare's time. Yet he handles it four times, now liter-
ally, now figuratively, with as much ease and grace as if it
had been one of the oldest words in the language. Listen to
Romeo:
Griefs ofmine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have itprest
With more ofthine.
Again, the figurative—that is to say, the only modern use
of influence—is
first quoted from his works, and we can
watch him gradually
taking
the meaning of the word
sphere through
its
historical developments of planetary
'sphere', high social rank, any sort of category. A certain
curious intransitive use of the verb take, as when a doctor
says 'the vaccination took very well', can also be traced
back to Shakespeare, and a few more of the innumerable
new uses of words which appear to have begun from him
154

Experiment
are sequence and creed, with purely secular meanings;
real,
in its ordinary modern sense of 'actual'; magic, magical, and
charm,
1 used figuratively; apology as the personal and verbal
expression of compunction; positive in
its psychological
sense; function,
used
biologically; fashion and fashionable
with their modern meanings; and action, meaning a battle.
The fact that the first examples of these new uses quoted in
the Oxford Dictionary are taken from Shakespeare cannot,
of course, be taken as absolute proof that he introduced
them. But there are so many of them, and the Dictionary
is so thorough, that there can be little doubt of his being the
first in many cases and among the first in every case.
Shakespeare's influence on the personal relations between
the sexes, as they have developed in subsequent periods of
English history,
is a matter for the literary and social his-
torian; but it is interesting to reflect how the meanings of
that group of Norman French words mentioned in the last
chapter, and of others which were slowly drawn into their
circle, must have expanded under the warm breath of his
vivacious and human heroines. The ideal atmosphere of
gracious tenderness which was the contribution to human-
ity of the Middle Ages was to some extent realized by the
Elizabethans. The women towards whom it was directed
became less and less mere ecclesiastical or poetical symbols,
existing only in the imagination of the lover, and more and
more creatures of real flesh and blood. Once again it is a
1 The transition of meaning is beautifully visible in the following passage
from The Merry Wives of Windsor:
Mistress Quickly: T never knew a woman so dote upon a man: surely, I
think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.'
Falstaff: 'Not I, I assure thee: setting the attraction ofmy good parts aside,
I have no other charms.'

case of a later age striving to live out what an earlier age
or
its few best minds—have dreamed. Thus, the Blessed
Virgin is partly supplanted in men's hearts by the virgin
Queen; the charming figure of Sidney—personified gentle-
ness and chivalry—actually passes across the stage of his-
tory; the peculiarly English word gentleman appears. And
we can hardly help holding Shakespeare partly responsible
for what is going forward when we find him writing
' the
devout religion of mine eye' and making Richard III im-
plore Anne to 'let the soul forth that adoreth thee'—where
the words religion and adore are both applied to humanity
for the first time, as far as we know, in English literature.
Moreover, the new access to the Classics added to all this
the direct influence of the Platonic philosophy which now
played, through Spenser and his circle, upon the thought
and feeling of the Elizabethan age. A careful reading of
Spenser's four hymns to Love, Beauty, Heavenly Love, and
Heavenly Beauty will throw much light on the subsequent
semantic history of the title words and ofmany others. We
find in them the Platonic antithesis between the Eternal and
its for-ever-changing outward garment:
For that same goodly hew ofwhite and red,
With which the cheekes are sprinckled, shall decay,
And those sweete rosy leaves sofairely spread
Upon the lips, shallfade andfall away
To that they were, even to corrupted clay.
Thatgolden wyre, those sparckling stars so bright
Shall turne to dust, and loose theirgoodly light.
But thatfaire lampe,from whose celestial ray
That light proceedes, which kindleth lovers'fire,

But when the vitall spirits doe expyre,
Unto her native planet shall retyre,

Being a parcell oj the purest skie.
and the conception of contemplation rising, through love,
from the one to the other, as in
For love is Lord oftruth and loialtie,
Lifting himselfe out ofthe lowly dust,
On golden plumes up to the purest skie.

or:
But they which love indeede, look otherwise,
With pure regard and spotless true intent,
Drawing out ofthe object oftheir eyes
A more refynedforme, which they present

finally,
in the Hymne of Heavenly Beauty,
Spenser
reveals the source ofhis faith:
Faire is the heaven, where happy soules have place,
Infull enjoyment offelicitie.
.
.
.
Morefaire is that where those Idees on hie,
Enraunged be, which Plato so admyred,
Andpure Intelligences^/rom God inspyred.
When we recall the great influence which Spenser's poetry
has exerted on English poets who have lived and written
since his day, we can clearly see how the two kinds of
Platonism—a direct Platonism, and a Platonism long ago
transmuted and worked right down into the emotions of
151

Experiment
common people by the passionate Christianity of the Dark
and Middle Ages—combined to beget the infinite sugges-
tiveness which is now contained in such words as love and
beauty. Let us remember, then, that every time we abuse
these terms, or use them too lightly, we are draining them
of their power; every time a society journalist or a film
producer exploits this vast suggestiveness to tickle a vanity
or dignify a lust, he is squandering a great pile of spiritual
capital which
has been
laid up by centuries of weary
effort.
The fact that a great deal of what had formerly been
religious emotion was being secularized in this way does
not, however, mean that the Church had ceased to play an
all-important part in the life of the people. The Reforma-
tion seems, with its insistence on the inwardness of all true
grace, to have been but another manifestation ofthat steady
shifting inwards of the centre of gravity of human con-
sciousness which we have already observed in the scientific
outlook. That shift is, in a larger sense, the story told by the
whole history of the Aryan languages. Thus religion itself,
which had formerly been used only ofexternal observances
or of monastic orders, took on at about this time its mod-
ern, subjective meaning. Now
it was that piety, differen-
tiating itself from pity, began to acquire
its present sense.
Godly,
godliness,
and godless are
first found in Tindale's
writings, and evangelical and sincere are words which have
been noted by a modern writer as being new at this time
and very popular among the Protestants. The great word
Protestant itselfwas applied formerly to the German princes
who had dissented from the decision of the Diet of Spires
in 1529, and together with Reformation it now acquired its
i 58

Experiment
new and special meaning, while the old words, dissent and
disagree, were
transferred
at about the same time from
material objects to matters ofopinion.
Another
little group of words which appeared in the
language at about this time is interesting in its suggestion
that human emotions, like the forces of Nature, are usually
accompanied by their equal and opposite reactions. The
well-known phrases, odium
theologicum and odium philo-
sophicum, survive to remind us of a new kind of bitterness
and hatred which had slowly been arising in men's hearts,
and which were also, it would seem, the gifts of Christian-
ity and the Dark Ages. Very soon after the Reformation
we find alongside the syllables of tenderness and devotion a
very
pretty
little
vocabulary of abuse.
Bigoted, faction,
factious, malignant, monkish, papistical, pernicious, popery are
among the products of the struggle between Catholic and
Protestant; and the terms Roman, Romanist, and Romish
soon acquired such a vituperative sense that it became neces-
sary to evolve Roman
Catholic in order
to
describe the
adherents of that faith without giving offence to them. The
later internecine
struggles among
the
Protestants them-
selves gave us Puritan, precise,
libertine—reminiscent of a
time when 'liberty' of thought was assumed as a matter of
course to include licence of behaviour
credulous,
super-
stitious,
selfish,
selfishness, and the awful Calvinistic word
reprobate. It was towards the end of the Puritan ascendancy
that atone and atonement (at-one-ment) acquired their present
strong suggestion of legal expiation, and
it may not be
without significance that the odious epithet vindictive was
then for the first time applied approvingly to the activities
ofthe Almighty Himself.
i59

Experiment
As the language grows
older, when
all the principal
tributaries have met at last in the main stream,
it begins,
unfortunately,
to
tell a less and less coherent tale of the
people who speak it. The few large groups of new words
and meanings which we have hitherto been tracing give
way to a much greater number of small groups—or even
of single words—for the vocabulary
is now so capacious
that important new movements of thought are likely to
find the old terms adaptable to their use with very slight
semantic alterations, or perhaps with the formal addition of
an -arian, an -ism, or an -ology. These become accordingly
harder to trace, and a book ofthese dimensions is obliged to
select a word here and a word there in almost arbitrary
fashion. It must be remembered, then, in this and the suc-
ceeding chapters
that only a few of the tendencies and
changes
at work have been picked out
for
inspection,
though it is probable that a study of words, which should
be
at the same time subtle and comprehensive enough,
would throw some light on them all.

When
Charles II returned from France to an
England which had long been growing more
and more sullen under the reproving glances
of a middle-aged Puritanism, the suppressed thoughts and
feelings of fashionable English society evidently
lost no
time in rising to the surface. The appearance in the seven-
teenth century of new expressions such
as
to
banter,
to
burlesque, to ridicule, to prim, travesty, badinage, and, above
all, prig, helps to
fill in for the imagination the deep gulf
between the Pilgrim's Progress and the Country Wife. Even
to those
totally unacquainted with the
literature of the
period this little archipelago of words might betray with
unmistakable
solidity the moral geography of the sub-
merged region. For it marks a cycle of events which has
been repeated over and over again in the history ofhuman-
ity, in
its families,
its societies,
its nations. Certain moral
qualities gain respect for themselves;
the
respect brings
with it material benefits; weaker brethren affect the moral
qualities in order to acquire the material benefits; hypo-

is detected;
all morality is treated as hypocrisy. The
trite little cycle spins like a whirligig round and round the
social history of the world, but this is a good place to lay a
finger on it, for it is a process in which the question of the
meanings of words takes a particularly active part. It is, in
fact, one of the few occasions upon which ordinary men,
neither
scientists nor poets,
will deliberately attempt to
alter the meanings of the words they must use. 'Morality',
said the late Sir Walter Raleigh,
' colours all language and
lends to
it the most delicate of its powers of distinction';
and
so, when any significant change
takes place in the
moral standards ofa community, it is immediately reflected
in a general shifting ofthe meanings ofcommon words.
One of the earliest recorded examples of such a shift is
analysed with
sharp
penetration by Thucydides
in
his
account of the demoralization of the Greek States during
the Peloponnesian War:
'Proper shame (he says)
is now termed sheer stupidity:
shamelessness, on the other hand, is called manliness: volup-
tuousness passes for good tone: haughtiness for good edu-
cation:
lawlessness
for
freedom:
honourable
dealing
is
dubbed hypocrisy, and dishonesty, good fortune.
Similar, but less conspicuous and rapid, alterations ofmood
must have been at work when silly lost its old meaning of
'blessed'; when demure changed from 'grave' or 'sober' to
'affectedly modest'; and when the kindly officious acquired
its modern sense of bustling interference. Trench regards it
as a tribute to the Roman character that theirs is the only
civilized language in which the word for 'simple' never
acquired
a contemptuous
signification
alongside of
its
162

Personality and Reason
ordinary one. And at the opposite pole from Thucydides
we have another Aryan historian, Mr. G. K. Chesterton,
good-humouredly
suggesting what might
be
called
a
semantic method ofslipping offa Semitic incubus:
'As for sin, let us call it folly and have done with it, for
until we call it folly we never shall have done with it. The
conception of sin
flatters us grossly. There
is something
grandiose in it that cannot but appeal to the child in every
man. That we infinitesimal creatures, scrambling like ants
over the face of this minor planet in pursuit ofour personal
aims—that we have it in our power to affront the majesty
of the universe is a most preposterous, delightful fancy
It may be remarked in passing that there is no surer or
more illuminating way of reading a man's character, and
perhaps a little of his past history, than by observing the
contexts in which he prefers to use certain words. Each of
us would no doubt choose his own list of test words—and
the
lists themselves, if we were foolish enough to reveal
them, would probably present a fairly accurate diagram of
our own leading propensities. Fortunately the subject is too
long to elaborate.
Ogle is another new word which appeared soon after the
Restoration; and at the same time intrigue, which had come
into the language earlier in the century in the general sense of
'intricacy', was seized upon to express an illicit love-affair.
The steady growth of ' polite ' society during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries is also—curiously enough—indica-
ted by the gradual appearance of bearish, countrified, fatuous,
flippant, gawky,
mawkish,
prude,
and
other such terms.
Hoyden was first used ofa girl by Wycherley in 1676.

But outside the limelit circle this period was one ofrapid
intellectual development. That the novel interest in the
external world, typified in the sixteenth century by such
new words as analyse, distinguish, investigate,
1 expanded con-
tinuously during the next hundred years is suggested by the
addition to our vocabulary of inspect, remark and scrutinize,
together with
the modern meanings of perception
and
scrutiny, which had meant up till then respectively
' the col-
lection of rents' and 'the taking of a vote'. We also find a
group ofnew words to describe the inherent conditions and
qualities ofexternal objects, such as acid, astringency, cohesion,
elasticity,
equilibrium, fluid
(as
a noun),
intensity, polarity,
pressure,
spontaneous,
static,
temperature,
tendency,
tension,
volatile, besides the physical and impersonal meanings of
energy and force. The old verb to discover, which originally
signified simply to 'uncover' or 'reveal',
2 was used attribu-
tively in the sixteenth century of travellers 'discovering'
foreign lands and customs. Shortly after the Restoration
the new metaphor, so
it would seem, was
itself applied
metaphorically to the results ofa chemical experiment, and
in this way the ordinary modern meaning arose. The crea-
tion of the new word gas by the Dutch chemist van Hel-
mont marks a definite epoch in the evolution of the scien-
tific outlook. He used
it, however, to describe an occult
principle—a sort of ultra-rarefied water—which he sup-
posed to be contained in all matter. It was not until the last
quarter of the eighteenth century that the word acquired
its modern meaning of 'matter in the condition of an aeri-

still retains in stage directions—e.g. 'The curtain

form fluid', at which time the word gaseous also appeared.
Ether (Greek
'aither',
'the upper air' above the clouds),
which had been practically a synonym for the Aristotelian
quintessence, 1 was now adopted to express the mechanical
substitute for that spiritual medium, required by modern
science in order to explain the phenomenon of action at a
distance. These are among the first attempts which were
made
to
describe the outer world objectively—from
its
own point of view instead of from the point of view of
divinity or of human souls;
it is interesting, therefore, to
reflect that the success achieved is really only a relative one,
as all the words mentioned, with the possible exception of
gas,
2 are in the first place metaphors drawn from human
activities
such
as
those
of
'cutting',
'stretching',
and
'pulling'.
In about the year 1660 the spirit ofcurious inquiry which
was abroad prompted the foundation of the Royal Society,
for
the purpose,
as
its
title announced, of 'Improving
Natural Knowledge',
and
it
is
notable
that
the word
improve should have been employed. Originating,
as we
saw, in Lawyer's French, it had been used up to about 1620
to denote merely
' the enclosure and cultivation of waste
land'. So that when we find its old meaning butchered to
make a striking metaphor,
it
is reasonable to assume that
some new idea or feeling had come to the front, to which
men were struggling to give the outward expression that is
life, that their outlook had changed somewhat, and that

they were groping for a means of readjusting their cosmos
accordingly.
We have attempted
so
far
to
trace
the evolution of
Western outlook from the earliest days of Greece down to
the Revival of Learning in England.
It must not be for-
gotten that this process is hitherto an unconscious one. Up
to the seventeenth century the outlook of the European
mind upon the world, fluid as it has always been, has yet
always
felt itself to be at rest, just as men have hitherto
believed that the earth on which they trod was a solid and
motionless body. The first appearance of a distinction be-
tween ancient and modern, and of the word progressive, in
Bacon's Essays has already been noted, and we find that
progress itself had only begun to emerge a few years before
from its relatively parochial meaning of 'royaljourney' or,
as we
still say, 'progress'. To the seventeenth century, as
Mr.
Pearsall Smith has pointed out, we owe the words
antiquated, century, decade, epoch, Gothic, out-of-date, primeval,
and we may add to
these contemporary,
contemporaneous,
synchronize,
synchronous,
and
a
queer jungle-growth of
words with similar meanings which sprang up about the
middle of the seventeenth century and has since vanished:
contemporal, co-temporary, contemporize, isochronal, synchronal,
synchronical,
synchronism,
synchronistic. A
curious
feature
about these latter words is the number of them which first
appeared in theological writings, the mystic philosopher,
Henry More, being alone responsible for three. They seem
to have arisen chiefly from an interest in comparing the
dates of different events recorded in Scripture, and they
may thus be placed beside the epithet primitive, applied by
the Reformers to the early Church, which Mr.
Pearsall
1 66

Personality and Reason
Smith has pointed to as 'probably the first word in which
our modern historical sense finds expression'.
When we try combing the dictionaries—Greek, Latin,
English, and others—for words expressing a sense of the
'march ofhistory', or indeed of a past or future differing at
all essentially from the present, we are forced to the con-
clusion that this kind of outlook on time is a surprisingly
recent growth. We saw how the Greek
'historia' could
mean practically any kind of knowledge; in the same way,
when 'periodos'
(literally 'way round') was used of time,
it meant a cycle, one of a recurring series; it was not till the
eighteenth century
that
a period of history acquired
its
modern sense of an indefinite portion cut from a con-
tinuous process. Labels like Middle Ages, Renaissance,

are none ofthem earlier than the eighteenth century, which
also saw the new expressions develop and development, and
the fact that the significant words anachronism, 1 evolution, 1
and prehistoric, with the new perspectives they denote, only
appeared
during
the
nineteenth
century may make
us
doubtful whether the mists of time have even yet fallen
wholly from our eyes.
In order to enter sympathetically into the outlook of an
educated medieval gentleman, we have
to perform the
difficult feat of undressing, as it were, our own outlook by
divesting it of all those seemingly innate ideas ofprogress
and evolution, ofa movement ofsome sort going on every-
where around us, which make our cosmos what it is. This is
more difficult even than it sounds, because so many ofthese
thoughts and feelings have become subconscious. We have
imbibed them with our vocabulary and cannot without

much labour and research disentangle the part that is due to
them from the rest of our consciousness. Let us try, for a
moment, to realize with our imaginations as well as with
our
intellects
the world in which our
fathers dwelt—
a
world created abruptly
at a fixed moment in time, and
awaiting a destruction equally abrupt,
its inhabitants for
ever to be the same, and for ever struggling, not to progress
or to evolve into something different, but rather to become
once more exactly like the first man and woman. Where
we speak of progress and evolution, the Middle Ages could
speak only of regeneration and amendment. Their evolution
was like Alice's race with the Red Queen.
It took all their
energies to keep
still; and even in this they had very little
hope of succeeding, for they believed that the world was
getting steadily worse.
But perhaps their total lack of historical imagination
is
brought home to us most forcibly by the prevalent belief
that—apart from the Chosen People—all the inhabitants of
the pre-Christian world were doomed to eternal exclusion
from paradise. When we recollect that for some time the
doctors ofmedieval universities were obliged to swear upon
oath that they would teach nothing contrary to the doc-
trines of a Greek philosopher who must already have been
in this situation for three hundred years at the birth of the
Redeemer, and when we further
reflect that
it was the
acute brains of these very doctors which were engaged in
building up our present thinking apparatus, we may well
feel inclined to give up as hopeless the task of sympatheti-
cally recreating the medieval cosmos in our imaginations
unless we realize, as indeed the history of meanings clearly
shows, that it is not merely ideas and theories and feelings
1 68

Personality and Reason
which have changed, but the very method offorming ideas
and of combining them,
the very
channels,
apparently
eternal, by which one thought or feeling is connected with
another. Possibly the Middle Ages would have been equally
bewildered
at the
facility with which twentieth-century
minds are brought to believe that, intellectually, humanity
languished for countless generations in the most childish
errors on all sorts of crucial subjects, until it was redeemed
by some simple scientific dictum ofthe last century.
There is another difference between the past and the pre-
sent which it is hard for us to realize; and perhaps this is the
hardest of all. For with the seventeenth century we reach
the point at which we must at last try to pick up and inspect
that discarded garment of the human soul, intimate and
close-fitting as it was, into which this book has been trying
from the fifth chapter onwards to induce the reader to re-
insert his modern limbs. The consciousness of 'myself ' and
the distinction between 'my-self ' and all other selves, the
antithesis between 'myself, the observer, and the external
world, the observed,
is such an obvious and early fact of
experience to every one of us, such a fundamental starting-
point ofour life as conscious beings, that it really requires a
sort of training of the imagination to be able to conceive of
any different kind of consciousness. Yet we can see from
the history ofour words that this form ofexperience, so far
from being eternal,
is quite a recent achievement of the
human spirit. It was absent from the old mythological out-
look; absent, in its fullness, from Plato and the Greek philo-
sophers; and, though
it was beginning to light up in the
Middle Ages, as we see in the development of Scholastic
words like individual and person, yet the medieval soul was

still felt to be joined by all sorts of occult ties both to the
physical body and to the world. Self-consciousness,
as we
know it, seems to have first dawned faintly on Europe at
about the time of the Reformation, and it was not till the
seventeenth century
that the new light really began to
spread and brighten. One of the surest signs that an idea or
feeling
is coming to the surface of consciousness—surer
than the appearance of one or two new words—is the ten-
dency of an old one to form compounds and derivatives.
After the Reformation we notice growing up in our lan-
guage a whole crop of words hyphened with self; such are
self-conceit, self-liking, self-love, and others at the end of the
sixteenth
century,
and
self-confidence,
self-command,
self-
contempt,
self-esteem,
self-knowledge,
self-pity, ... in
the
next.
From a full list of such words as the above the historical
student ofwords and their meanings could almost predict,
apart from any other source of knowledge, the appearance
at about this time ofsome philosopher who should do intel-
lectually to the cosmos what Copernicus and Kepler had
already done astronomically—that
is, turn
it inside out.
And in Descartes, with his doctrine of 'Cogito, ergo sum',
we do, in fact, find just such a philosopher. His influence
was immense. Practically
all philosophy since his day has
worked outwards from the triinking self rather than in-
wards from the cosmos to the soul. In England, not long
afterwards, we find the brand-new expressions,
'the ego*
and egoism, coming into the language from French philo-
sophy, while the English thinker, Locke, adopts the new
(1632) word consciousness, defining it as 'perception ofwhat
passes in a man's own mind', and at the same time impresses
170

Personality and Reason
on the
still newer self-consciousness1
its distinctive modern
meaning.
Though these two developments—the birth of an his-
torical sense and the birth of our modern self-consciousness
—may seem at first sight to have little connection with one
another, yet it is not difficult, on further consideration, to
perceive that they are both connected with that other and
larger process which has already been pointed to
as the
story told by the history ofthe Aryan languages as a whole.
If we wished to find a name for it, we should have to coin
some such ugly word as 'internalization'. It is the shifting
of the centre of gravity of consciousness from the cosmos
around him into the personal human being himself. The
results are twofold: on the one hand the peculiar freedom
ofmankind, the spontaneous 2 impulseswhich control human
behaviour and destiny, are felt to arise more and more from
within the individual, as we saw in the semantic change of
such words as conscience, disposition, spirit, temper, ... in the
application to inner processes of words like dissent, gentle,
perceive, religion, and in the Protestant Reformation; on the
other the spiritual life and activity felt to be immanent in
the world outside—in star and planet, in herb and animal,
in thejuices and 'humours' ofthe body, and in the outward
ritual ofthe Church—these grow feebler. The conception of
'laws' governing this world arises and grows steadily more
impersonal; words like consistency, pressure, tension, ... are
found to describe matter 'objectively' and disinterestedly,
and at the same time the earth ceases to be the centre round
which the cosmos revolves. All
this time the European

Personality and Reason
'ego' appears to be engaged, unawares, in disentangling
itself from its environment—becoming less and less of the
actor, more and more of both the author and the spectator.
In the eighteenth century the word outlook is used for the
first time in the sense in which it has been used here; in the
nineteenth environment is introduced by Carlyle. And so it
goes on; and
as, on the one hand,
it
is only when that
detachment has progressed
to
a
certain point that man
becomes able to observe the changes which constitute his-
tory, so it is only as he begins to observe them that he be-
comes fully conscious ofhimself—the observer.
Thus, the general process which we have called 'intern-
alization' can be traced working itself out into all kinds of
details; not only in that intimate, metaphysical change of
outlook which it is so hard for us to realize now that the
change has taken place—in the appearance of words be-
tokening a sharper self-consciousness—but also in the moral
and personal sphere. We could, for instance, take such a
common word as duty and mark its expansion of meaning
at about the time of Shakespeare. By its derivation it carries
the sense of 'owing', and it meant in Chaucer's time an act
of obedience which was owed to some other person
usually to a feudal superior. 1
It
is not
till the close of the
sixteenth century that it begins to take on its modern sense
of a more or less abstract moral obligation—an obligation
owed, if to any being, to oneself or to a sort of ideal of
manhood—such an ideal, for instance, as is expressed in the
word gentleman. Later on, as with conscience, there is a ten-
dency to personify it. At the beginning of the seventeenth

Scotland, as afeu duty on land.

century we first find the word Nature employed in con-
texts where medieval writers would certainly have used the
single word God. Spontaneous has already been mentioned,
and it is interesting to note a certain tendency, which seems
to have been inherent, before Shakespeare's time, in the
adjective
voluntary,
to connote disapproval when
it was
applied to human actions or feelings. Later in the century
the word character
1 was
first used in
its modern personal
sense by the historian Clarendon.
Students of the period know well the sudden,
extra-
ordinary craze for 'character-drawing' which swept over
France and England at this time. In France literary 'por-
traits' of oneself and one's friends were produced in hun-
dreds, the first as a hobby, the second actually as a round
game; and Clarendon, whose History of the Great Rebellion
is a string ofsuch character-studies, was only doing system-
atically what men like Hall, Overbury, Earle, and others
had already done in a more disjointed and dilettante way.
To the medieval observer a person or a soul had been inter-
esting chiefly in its relation to Society, to the Church, to the
Cosmos. 'All the personality of man,' said Wyclif, 'stand-
eth in the spirit of him.' But these new writers and their
readers were interested in
characters and
characteristics for
their own sakes. We begin to hear ofpeople's autographs, of

fade away, and their modern meanings arise instead. One
relic of these ancient physics, however—the vapours which
were supposed to rise into the head from the region of the
stomach—lingered well on into the eighteenth century; and
from the way in which Boswell and Johnson write of then-
fits of melancholy, it seems that they had just reached a point
at which they could not be sure, from their feelings at any
rate, whether their common malady was physical in
its
origin or purely mental.
The same difference is observable in the names for feel-
ings and passions. The nomenclature of the Middle Ages
generally views them from without, hinting always at their
results or their moral significance
envy, greedy, happy
(i.e.
'lucky'),
malice,
mercy,
mildheartness, peace, pity, 2
remorse,
repentance, rue, sin,

.
. Even the old word sad had not long
lost its original sense of ' sated '
,
' heavy' (which it still retains
in sad bread), and fear continued for a long time to mean,
not the emotion, but a 'sudden and unexpected event'.
Hardly before the beginning of the seventeenth century do
we find expressed that sympathetic or 'introspective' atti-
tude to the feelings which
is conveyed by such labels as
aversion, dissatisfaction, discomposure,
.
.
. while depression and
emotion—further lenient names for human weaknesses
were used till then ofmaterial objects.
In the eighteenth century we notice, as we should expect,
a considerable increase in the number ofthese words which
attempt to portray character or feeling from within; such
are apathy, chagrin,
diffidence,
ennui, homesickness, together

with the expression
' thefeelings' , while agitation, constraint,
disappointment, embarrassment, excitement are transferredfrom
the outer to the inner world. Outlook, which meant
' a place
from which a good view is obtained', was first employed
figuratively by Dr. Young in 1742.
This brings us to another
class of words—appropriate
enough to the century which produced Berkeley's Prin-
ciples ofHuman Knowledge—describing external things not
objectively, from their own point of view, but purely by
the effects which they produce on human beings, such, for
instance,
as
affecting,
amusing,
boring,
charming,
diverting,
entertaining, enthralling, entrancing, exciting, fascinating, inter-
esting, and pathetic in its modern sense, none of which are
found before the seventeenth and only a few before the
eighteenth century. These adjectives can be distinguished
sharply—indeed they are in a sense the very opposite of
those older words, which can
also be
said, though
less
accurately, to describe external objects 'from the human
point of view'. Thus, when a Roman spoke of events as
auspicious or sinister, or when some natural object was said
in the Middle Ages to be baleful, or benign, or malign, a herb
to possess such and such a virtue, an eye to be evil, or the
bones of a saint to be holy, or even, probably, when Gower
wrote:
The day was merry and fair enough,
it is true that these things were described from the human
point ofview, but the activity was felt to emanate from the
object
itself. When we speak of an object or an event as
amusing, on the contrary, we know that the process indi-
cated by the word amuse takes place within ourselves; and
>75

Personality and Reason
this is none the less obvious because some of the adjectives
recorded above, such as charming, enchanting, andfascinating,
are the present participles ofverbs which formerly did imply
genuine, occult activity.
The change is an important one; it is a reverberation into
wider and wider
circles of the
scholastic progress from
Realism to Nominalism, and inside the walls of the Church
we can perceive
the same movement going on
at
the
Reformation in the Protestant and Dissenting tendency to
abandon belief in the Real Presence. Perhaps the somersault
was turned most neatly by the old Aristotelean word sub-
jective, which developed in the seventeenth century from its
former meaning of 'existing in itself to the modern one of
'existing in human consciousness'. Objective made a similar
move in the opposite direction. When using such words as
'progress' and 'develop' in this connection, however, we
must remember that the semantic histories ofwords merely
inform us of changes which have actually occurred in a
large number of minds or 'outlooks'. They tell us ofwhat
is earlier and what is later, but not of truth and error. In this
direction all that a knowledge of them can do is to equip
us a little better for forming opinions ofour own.
At the same time we find a few words to denote the kind
of people who are easily 'affected' in this way. Susceptible
is first found in Clarendon, and in the eighteenth century
the words sensible and sensibility acquire their special sense
of 'easily affected' or 'having the emotions easily aroused';
and as this kind of experience grows more familiar, clearer
heads become conscious of it, and the new words sentiment
and sentimental appear. Sentimental, which was first used in
the title of Sterne's Sentimental Journey, published in 1768,
i-l6

Personality and Reason
was found so convenient that the French language borrowed
and the German translated it. No doubt these new notions
of 'sensibility' and 'sentimentality', of a variety of emo-
tions lying dormant in the bosom and waiting eagerly to be
called forth, combined with the recently developed interest
in
character
to
produce
the
curious
personality, which
acquired its modern meaning a few years later and has gone
on increasing in popularity ever since.
It is impossible in the short space that is left to us to do
justice to that extraordinary interlude in England's literary
and
social
history—the eighteenth century. The age of
powder and platitudes, of charmers and sivaim; the age of
artificial 'ruins' and of ugly shaven heads secretly perspir-
ing under fashionable periwigs; this age seems to us now to
have faded away as suddenly and inexplicably as it arose,
leaving only the faintest traces upon our language. Those
half-hidden vestiges, however—the just slightly different
shades of meaning with which sundry familiar words were
used a hundred and fifty years ago—sometimes seem to
fascinate us by the very paradox of their proximity and
elusiveness. We feel that, ifwe could only bring them out
in some way, we might take from them the very form and
pressure of the age. And so, when we come across some
particularly popular word like reason in eighteenth-century
literature, we are sometimes tempted to lay down the book,
while imagination goes groping vainly round the impene-
trable fringe of that mysterious no-man's-land which lies
between words and their meanings.
Ifwe would seek for the genesis ofthe curious clockwork
cosmos through which the minds and imaginations of the
period seem to have moved with a measure ofcontentment,
'77

Personality and Reason
we should find it, perhaps, not so very far back in the past.
Emotionally, the age was still dominated by a pronounced
reaction against religious fanaticism—an attitude we
see
reflected in the changeable meaning of enthusiasm, which in
Plato's Greek meant 'possessed by a god'. Spenser uses it in
its Greek form in a good sense, but by the end of the seven-
teenth century we
find Henry More
writing:
'If ever
Christianity be exterminated,
it will be by enthusiasm';
and even as
late
as 1830 a certain zealous,
if dogmatic,
Churchman thought it worth while to write and publish a
Natural History ofEnthusiasm, in which that folly, especially
in
its
theological
aspect,
is
castigated with
appropriate
vigour. Fanatic, which had also meant 'possessed by a god
or demon', underwent the same change of meaning and
gave birth tofanaticism about the middle of the seventeenth
century.
Extravagant, which had formerly meant 'non-
codified', got its new meaning and produced extravagance.
And the way in which the word Gothic was used to describe
anything barbarous and uncouth reminds us of how the
eighteenth century perceived barbarity and uncouthness in
many places where we no longer see it—such as medieval
architecture, much of which was pulled down at this time
and replaced by buildings which were
felt to be more
'correct' and classical.
Intellectually, on the other hand, men's minds seem to
have been influenced above all things by that conception of
impersonal 'laws' governing the universe which, as we saw
in the
last chapter, was scarcely apprehended before the
previous century. Poets and philosophers alike were de-
lighted by the perfect order in which they perceived the
cosmos to be arranged. They sought everywhere for ex-
i 78

Personality and Reason
amples of this orderliness. Pope, for instance, praises Wind-
sor Forest on the ground that it is a place:
Not Chaos-like together crush'd and bruisd;
But, as the world, harmoniously confusd:
Where order in variety we see,
And where, tho
all things differ, all agree.
This appreciation of Nature's regularity—from which we
do not ourselves so easily derive poetic inspiration—is now
so familiar that it is difficult for us to realize its freshness at
that time. Yet this is unquestionably demonstrated by the
dates at which such crucial words as arrange, category, classify ,
method,
organize,
organization,
regular,
regulate,
regularity,
system, systematic, ... or their modern meanings, appeared
in the language. Only two of these are
earlier than the
seventeenth, and most of them
are not found
till
the
eighteenth century. Thus, arrange was a military term like
array until that time, and regular was only used of monastic
'orders' until the close ofthe sixteenth century.
It is this universal conformity to laws, then, this perfect
order reigning everywhere undisturbed, which the eigh-
teenth century seems to have had in mind when it used, and
sometimes personified, the word Reason. Reason explained
everything.
Letgodlike Reasonfrom her sovereign throne
Speak the commanding word—/ will—and it is done,
wrote James Thomson, and Pope expressed the same idea
even more slickly when he announced in his Essay on Man:
'Whatever is, is right.' Thus, rapt in adoration of the radi-
ant new lady, the poets lost all interest in dame Nature. Only
H9

Personality and Reason
when she was arranged and regulated and organized into a
park or a landscape garden would they consent to have
anything to do with her, and then it was chiefly as a foil to
the superior attractions of her rival. She became a stage, a
'pleasing'
background
to
a
sort of everlasting human
boxing-match between reason and 'the passions'; and the
dictionary dates from this time our curious custom of des-
cribing her face as scenery. And then, after having quietly
murdered
her, poetry proceeded
to
galvanize
the poor
corpse into a shameful, marionette-like semblance oflife by
switching into it that supposititious personal sympathy with
human
affairs which mars so much of the verse of the
eighteenth century. We can, however, mark the beginning
of this practice at an earlier date.
The word conscious, like consciousness, was unknown until
the seventeenth century, when its newfangledness was ridi-
culed by Ben Jonson.
It
is odd,
therefore,
that the
first
recorded
uses
are
figurative,
applying
it
to
inanimate
objects. When we fmd Denham writing in 1643
:

The scenes ofhis past Triumphs and his Loves.
.
.
.
and Milton a few years later:
So all ere day-spring, under conscious Night

.
.
.
we can almost fancy, by their readiness to seize upon the
new word, that our poets were beginning, even so soon, to
feel the need of restoring 'subjectively' to external Nature
—of 'projecting into' her, as we are now inclined to say—
a
fanciful substitute for that voluntary
life and inner con-
180

Personality and Reason
nection with human affairs which Descartes and Hobbes
were draining from her in reality. The tendency we can see
here, carried to extravagant lengths, at last produced the
poetic conventions of the eighteenth century, by which
fictitious personality was
attributed to every object and
idea under the sun. Finally the complicated machinery of
classical mythology was applied in the same subjective and
purely
fanciful way to English society and the English
countryside.
It is in the same Windsor Forest that we are
asked to
See Pan withflocks, withfruits Pomona crowned,
Here blushing Flora paints the enamel *dground,
Here Ceres* gifts in waving prospect stand,
And nodding tempt thejoyful reaper's hand.
At first sight this state of affairs looks like an exact repeti-
tion of the later stages of Roman mythology, but in point
of fact the two outlooks are sharply distinguished by the
new element of self-consciousness. Myth was in some way
in the blood of the Romans;
it was a living part of their
national history, and in spite of all their
artificiality and
scepticism there is no evidence that they ever deliberately
created gods and goddesses of the fancy, in whom they
neither believed themselves nor expected anyone else to
believe. We imagine them
incapable of grasping,
for
instance, such an idea as that which found expression in the
brand-new
eighteenth-century
verb,
to
personify. One
wonders, therefore, to what extent the dawn ofa mechanical
age was reflecting itselfin this new outlook, this new cosmos
controlled by dead laws rather than
instinct with living
spirit, and therefore requiring to be peopled by the fancy.
181

Personality and Reason
We have spoken of the
eighteenth-century mind
as
living in a 'clockwork' cosmos, and
it
is interesting
to
reflect that even this simplest form of mechanical contri-
vance was a thing quite unknown to the ancient world.
Was the rhythmical mimicry of organic life, which is the
characteristic of machinery, already having its unperceived
effect on men's minds and philosophies? The influences
which go to make up the outlook of an age are sometimes
seen working most powerfully—though beneath the sur-
face—in the very minds which believe themselves to be
combating
that outlook most
stubbornly. The
closing
years of the eighteenth century produced Paley's famous
watch, a popular cosmic allegory which, in proving the
existence of a Creator, at the same time relegated
all His
activities to the remote past. But this is a subject which can
be more usefully considered in the next chapter. Thither
we must now turn in order to trace the further develop-
ment of the eighteenth-century gentleman's imaginative
double life—his life in the order and reason ofthe moral and
material universe and of 'sensibility' in the little universe of
himself—into two divergent directions.

Whatever else a child may be, in respect of this particular question
[respiration] , it is a complicated piece of mechanism, built up out of
materials supplied by its mother; and in the course of such building-
up, provided with a
set of motors—the muscles. Each of these
muscles contains a stock of substance capable of yielding energy
under certain conditions, one of which
is a change of state in the
nerve fibres connected with it. The powder in a loaded gun is such
another stock of substance capable of yielding energy in consequence
of a change of state in the mechanism of the lock.

these operate through the mechanism of the nervous machinery,
with the result that the potential energy of some of the work-stuff

into actual energy; and this, operating through the mechanism of the
respiratory apparatus, gives rise to an act of inspiration. As the bullet

Mechamsm
The
two most interesting points about the passage
quoted above from Science and Morals are firstly,
that it was written, not by an engineer, but by a
natural scientist; and secondly,
that the
title of the essay
from which it is taken is Capital and Labour. That is to say,
the abundance of mechanical simile
in
it
is neither the
natural colouring of an imagination subdued to what
it
works in, nor a deliberate system of metaphors fabricated
with the object of figuring forth a biological process to the
uninitiated. On the contrary, the notion of child-birth
is
itself only introduced for the purpose of illustration. The
images by which
it
is conveyed are thus revealed
as the
natural furniture of the writer's imagination. They can no
longer have been images to him, but rather his normal out-
look on the chain of facts in which he was most interested;
and the passage
is, of course, only one of thousands in
which we can see nineteenth-century imagination working
in a similar way.
It would be of small general interest to give a list of all
the mechanical and technical words which had come into
our vocabulary since the middle of the seventeenth century
—words like calculus, centrifugal, dynamic, galvanize, inertia,
momentum, oscillate, polarity, reciprocating, rotate, vibrate (ex-
cept in the sense
'to brandish'), 1
.
.
. We are concerned
more with their influence on the meanings of older words.
And from
this point of view the passage quoted from
Huxley can indeed give us a fair idea of the untold changes
that were secretly brewing when, for instance, the word
mechanic (Greek 'mechane', a 'device', or 'contrivance')
1 Used once in 1632 of sea-waves.
184

Mechanism
lost its old meaning of 'pertaining to manual labour', and
began to be applied to machines. This happened in the
seventeenth century, when also the word machine, which
had formerly been used of plots and intrigues, or for any-
thing erected or put together by man, was first used with
its modern meaning. We begin to hear of the six 'Mech-
anick
Faculties'
or 'Simple Machines',
i.e.
the
Balance,
Lever, Pulley, Screw, Wedge, and Wheel', and in a little book
called Mathematicall Magick, by Bishop Wilkins, one of the
first members of the Royal Society, these are discussed with
great enthusiasm and many respectful references to Aris-
totle. It is in the same work that we first hear in English of
a science of Mechanics. This new science, foreshadowed to
some extent by Aristotle, from whose treatise with that
title we take the word, had quickly been carried farther by
his successor, Archimedes. Most civilizations seem to have
produced towards their close mechanical devices of one
kind or another, but more
especially
'engines' of war.
What distinguishes our own is the way in which mechan-
ism has gradually entered into our outlook—a fact which is
marked, among other things, by our use ofthe Greek prefix
'auto-'
(self) for things worked by machinery. In a Greek
dictionary we find upwards of two hundred words begin-
ning with this prefix, but not one ofthem is applied to any-
thing mechanical.
Let us consider the word automatic. The Greek 'auto-
mates', which meant 'self-moved', 1 was Latinized in the
form 'automatus' at about the beginning of our era, and
1 Or 'self-minded'.
Its earliest appearance
is in Homer's Iliad, where
it
occurs twice, and
is applied to divine phenomena, viz. the gates of heaven
and the tripod of the god Hephaestus.
185

Mechanism
automatons—now obsolete—is actually found in the works
of the seventeenth-century writer,
Sir Thomas Browne.
This old adjective had the sense of 'spontaneous', 'of one's
own free will', and was used of the animal and vegetable
worlds as opposed to the mineral, or of events which came
about 'by chance'; while in Plato's philosophy the distinc-
tion between that which
is 'self-moved', and that which
can only be moved by something outside itself had been
taken
as
the very
antithesis between
spirit and matter,
between eternal and perishable. Automatic is first found in
English in the eighteenth century. The earliest quotation
given by the Oxford Dictionary is taken from David Hart-
ley, who wrote in 1748
:
' The motions of the body are of two kinds, automatic
and voluntary. The automatic motions are those which
arise from the mechanism of the body in an evident man-
ner. They are called automatic from their resemblance to
the motions of automata, or machines, whose principle of
motion is within themselves. Of this kind are the motions
ofthe heart and peristaltic motion ofthe bowels.'
In 1802 Paley pointed out 'the difference between an
animal and an automatic statue',
and sixty years later a
writer on physics,
after speaking of the amoeba as being
'irritable and automatic', added a note to the effect that
'Automatic
.
.
. has recently acquired a meaning almost
exactly opposite to that which
it originally bore, and an
automatic action
is now by many understood to mean
nothing more than an action produced by some machinery
or other. In this work I use it in the older sense, as denoting
186

Mechanism
an action of a body, the causes ofwhich appear to He in the
body itself
The reason for this semantic volte face may perhaps be
detected in the history of the parallel word automaton. This
had long ago (about 10 B.C.) been applied to the few primi-
tive mechanical devices which Aryan civilization had then
evolved, and its appearance in English seems to have pre-
ceded that of automatic by nearly two centuries, as it is found
in 1611 describing 'a picture of a gentlewoman' made with
eyes that open and shut. Then, later on in the same century,
it began to be applied to clocks and watches, and there
seems every reason to suppose that the presence of this par-
ticular kind of apparent 'self-mover' on so many mantel-
pieces and in so many vest-pockets must have determined
the peculiarly dead and mechanical meaning which auto-
matic now possesses.
The ancients measured time by the regulated flow of
water. Striking clocks ofsome kind were known in Europe
as far back as the twelfth or thirteenth century. But they
seem to have been unreliable, costly, and rare until the dis-
covery by
Galileo of the
'isochronism' of pendulums.
Pendulum is first found in 1660, in Boyle's writings, vibrate
and vibration in 1667. The new toy seems to have taken hold
of Europe's imagination in the most extraordinary way.
Both clockwork and mainspring were used figuratively the
first time they are known to have been used in English at
all, a sixteenth-century writer even anticipating Paley so
far as to write:
God's the main spring, that maketh every way
All the small wheels ofthis great Engin play.

pened so recently. Differences of outlook on such matters

readily perceive, though we may not
properly understand them; here we stand a long way off,
and can often see quite plainly how the old words have
altered their meanings. But from the way in which our
great grandfathers used such words as energy, midriff, motor,
muscle, nerve, respiration, work—to take examples only from
the passage quoted at the beginning of this chapter—we
sometimes find
it hard, even when we have traced the
history of their meanings up to that date,
to
feel what
different associations they must have called up to the gener-
ations which died before Huxley was born. At this time,
fifty years after his death,
it is only our own imagination,
working
introspectively on
such
a
phrase
as
'nervous
machinery', and grasping, as it can do, how the meanings
of the two words have been running into one another,
which can bring this difference before us. When it has done
so, we are again reminded of the simple yet striking truth
that all knowledge which has been conveyed by means of
speech to the reason has travelled in metaphors taken from
1 The meaning of this metaphor has probably been affected by the other
meaning ofspring (as in well-spring), but this did not occur till later.

Mechanism
man's own activities and from the solid things which he
handles. The present is no different from the past. Only the
metaphors get buried deeper and deeper beneath one an-
other; they interact more subtly, and do not always leave
any outward trace on the language. It would be interesting,
for example, were it possible, to discoverjust how much of
the average man's idea of blood circulation
is due to the
invention ofthat elementary mechanical device, the pump; 1
or how much of the mental image which he has formed of
the interaction of muscle,
nerve, and brain would fade
from his consciousness if there were no such thing
as the
electric telegraph.
We think by means of words, and we have to use the
same ones for so many different thoughts that, as soon as
new meanings have entered into one set, they creep into all
our theories and begin to mould our whole cosmos; and
from the theories they pass into more words, and so into
our lives and institutions. Thus, not only were the New-
tonian heavens the playground ofjust those forces which
had been used for the working ofthe six 'simple machines',
but Montesquieu insists that the English Whigs copied the
new astronomy when
they were
creating
the modern
British Constitution. Referring to this in one of his essays,
1 Not only is the word pump constantly used to describe the heart's action,
but one must also consider its reaction on the meaning of older physiological
terms such as
valve. Pump, with the meaning
'ship's pump',
is found in
English in the fifteenth century, but in the sense of 'instrument for raising
water' it is unknown to the Teutonic languages before the sixteenth century,
though instruments of some sort had been used for that purpose in classical
times. An understanding of the underlying mechanical principle, however,
only developed, as we should expect, in the seventeenth century, when the
words
suction and
hydraulic appeared
in,
for instance,
Bacon's
writings.
Harvey published his treatise, De motu cordis et sanguinis, in 1628.

Woodrow Wilson drew attention to the fact that the Con-
stitution of the United States had been made on the same
principle. 'They
[writers in the
Federalist]
speak of the
checks and balances of the Constitution,' he said, 'and use to
express their idea the simile of the organization of the uni-
verse, and particularly of the solar system.
.
.
.' And we
notice
that the President himself, when he went on to
speak of reconstructing the Constitution, was fain to lean
on another analogy, reminding his hearers that government
is
' not a machine, but a living thing ' ; that it is
' modified by
its environment,
necessitated by
its
tasks, shaped
to
its
functions by the sheer pressure of life'; and again that it is a
body ofmen 'with highly differentiated functions'. In fact,
we are merely launched into another set of metaphors, of
which, however, the speaker is in this case conscious, for he
explicitly affirms that government is
' accountable to Dar-
win, not to Newton'.
Environment, evolution, development,
instinct, species, spon-
taneous,
variation are some of the more important words,
whose modern meanings, if we look at their semantic his-
tory, are found to bear the unmistakable stamp ofDarwin-
ism, and we ought perhaps to add ooze 1 and slime. 1 To
Darwin we should have to attribute the tendency of evolu-
tion
to
lose
its
etymological
suggestion of a vegetable
growth, an unfolding from the centre outwards.

'species',

important place in the logic of the Middle Ages as one of
the five 'predicables' by which an object could be defined,
and
for
centuries
its
biological meaning was only one
among many. This particular interpretation did not begin
to come into prominence
until
the eighteenth century,
when Addison, for instance, used the phrase 'the species'
of the human race; but since Darwin published his Origin
of Species (in which the word is, of course, given an exclu-
sively biological sense)
it has, for the ordinary man, had
practically no other.
It is interesting to observe, that here
again,
as the words are commonly employed, the Latin
form has grown more concrete and the Greek more ab-
stract and intellectual.
But the change did not confine itself to such technical
words
as
these. One has only to pick up
a journalistic
article on almost any subject and read it, endeavouring to
let the words mean only what they did a hundred years ago,
to see how the whole scheme of Natural Selection can lurk
unseen, but not unfelt, behind some colourless little word
like
adapt,
competition,
gregarious,
modification,
protective,
selection, and even animal,facts, law, life, man, Nature, ... Or
we can see it in the curious, absolute use of the word fit, in
the sense of 'physically healthy', which, appearing first in
the seventies,
is obviously due to the famous phrase, the
'survival ofthe fittest'
(i.e. the fittest to survive in a struggle
for existence). How modern the new meanings are may be
gauged by the fact that the word heredity, the basic prin-
ciple of modern natural scientific theory,
is recorded by
Francis Galton as having been considered
' fanciful and un-
usual' in 1859, while atavism first appears in 1833.
Now that a little more time has elapsed and the nine-

Mechanism
teenth century can be properly studied from the semantic
point of view, it may begin to dawn on us that the inter-
fusion of mechanical and biological conceptions and the
penetration of both
into
meaning
presents
one
of
its
most striking
features. One of the greatest triumphs of
mechanism—greater
than
the
Forth Bridge
or
the
St.
Gothard Tunnel—is the fact that it has wormed itself into
the meaning of the word cause. This
is, of course, a word
which tends to
alter
its meaning a little every time
it
is
used, and there is evidence that in former times, while there
were
separate words
to
express
such
separate
ideas
as
'bringing to birth', 'making to grow', 'being guilty of,
.
.
. there was no general term into which one single essence
supposed to be common to all these relations had been dis-
tilled. The Greek and Latin words for cause, for example,
were both closely connected from the earliest times with
their legal procedure
(cf. ac-cuse, etc., and the modern use
of cause in the same sense). At some period, however—per-
haps in the last two centuries before our era—such a con-
cept must have been
precipitated, and we
find Cicero
defining the Latin
'causa', with mathematical precision,
simply as
' that which effects the thing of which it
is the
cause'. The fascination which this abstraction exerted on
the medieval imagination may bejudged from the fact that
the writer of a fifteenth-century
treatise on Love intro-
duced into it the sentence: 'Every cause of a cause is cause
ofthing caused' ; and we soon find the philosophers seeking
through a 'chain' of causes for that First Cause, which they
identified with the Almighty. By the nineteenth century
this thought-system of an abstract causality, brought about
by means ofabstract 'laws', lay, like an empty house, ready
192

Mechanism
to be taken over by a new owner. The new owner was
mechanism.
'The great abstract law of mechanical causality' (mech-
anische Kausalitat), wrote Haeckel in 1899, 'now rules the
entire universe, as it does the mind of man. It is the steady,
immutable pole-star, whose clear light
falls on our path
through the dark labyrinth of the countless separate pheno-
mena.'
Under its influence even consciousness itself was, and still
is, often conceived of as being caused by mechanical move-
ments taking place within the body. We also fmd thought
described as
a. function of the brain. This curious word had
become extremely
popular;
and somewhere
about
the
sixties the noun began to be used as a verb. We hear of
nerves, brain, heart,
.
. .functioning or refusing to function,
an expression in which the mechanical flavour is especially
strong.
Thus, in the light of words, the historical relation be-
tween mechanics and physiology looks not unlike that rela-
tion between mathematics and astronomy which was sug-
gested in a previous chapter. We drew from out our own
bodies,
it would seem, the sense-experiences of force and
pressure and the like, 1 on which mechanics are based; then
we externalized them in tools and machines, and turned
them into
abstract
'laws';
finally, we proceeded
to
re-
apply the 'laws' to the familiar objects from which we had
first extracted them, and the result was that we turned our
previous notions of these inside out. For the typical intel-
lectual position towards the end of the nineteenth century

was exactly the reverse of the typical Academic position.
Plato had deduced the sense-world from what we have
called the inner world, and, while he had worked out an
elaborate and wise knowledge of this inner world, with its
moral impulses and
aspirations,
his philosophy had
re-
mained admittedly bankrupt as far as detailed knowledge
of the mechanism of the outer world was concerned. Nine-
teenth-century
science, on the other hand, deduced the
inner from the outer; it had mapped and charted the mech-
anical part of Nature to a tenth of a millimetre, 1 but it was
wellnigh bankrupt as far as the inner world was concerned.
Huxley invented the word agnostic (not-knowing) to ex-
press his own attitude, and that of many millions since his
day, to the nature and origin of all this part of the cosmos.
One of the few things about which practically all 'men of
science', as the phrase now went, besides all those laymen
who took the trouble to follow out the various scientific
discoveries and to listen to their metaphysical reverbera-
tions, were agreed upon was that his senses and his reason
had succeeded in placing man in a material environment
which appeared to bear no relation whatever to his inner
feelings and moral impulses.
For the expression of these, his proper humanity, he con-
tinued, irrespective of his conscious belief, to live on what
had been developed through Plato and the Gospels, the
Church and the poets. For it was these,
as we have seen,
which had built up the meanings of those old words in

terms ofwhich he learnt to think and feel about his fellow-
men. Whenever the biologico-mechanical meanings did
creep into human relationships—as, for example, into the
economic relationship through the word competition and
otherwise—the result was, almost without exception, dis-
astrous. The famous Encyclical Letter and Syllabus of 1864,
in which modern movements of thought were condemned
and anathematized wholesale from the Vatican, was thus in
some sense an attempt to express in dogmatic form a prin-
ciple which was, in fact, already active throughout Europe.
And the pathetic impotence of this papal gesture probably
marks the maximum point of that divergence between
science and religion, as modes of experience, which first
became noticeable in the Alexandrian world, and ofwhich
nineteenth-century
philosophy
had become
sufficiently
conscious to create the word Dualism.
The rapid conquest of intellectual Europe, which was
achieved, not only by the general idea of evolution, but by
the particular Darwinian theory ofmechanical natural selec-
tion, is a matter of some surprise when we consider that a
full acceptance of it necessitated a reversal of practically
every metaphysical idea and feeling likely to be present in a
nineteenth-century soul. No doubt one could point to a
variety of causes. There is evidence, for instance, in a cer-
tain class of word which had recently begun to multiply
that even
in Protestant countries
the
custodians of the
ancient outlook were not always fortresses of wisdom and
enlightenment. Religionism appears towards the close of the
eighteenth century, and then
religiosity

and in the next century the now obsolete
religiose. The

word pious, which had long been degenerating towards an
imputation of feeble-mindedness, formed an unpleasant
derivative, pietism, which in turn produced
its adjective
pietistic; and in 1 864—an appropriate year—we first come up
against clericalism. Unction—the name of one of the deepest
mysteries of the Catholic Church—is first recorded by the
Oxford English Dictionary with an offensive meaning in 1 870,
when Lowell writes of 'that clerical unction whichin avulgar
nature so easily degenerates into greasiness'.
Unctuous was
not long in following suit, and instances could no doubt be
multiplied. The extension towards the priesthood ofthis par-
ticular shade of disapproval seems to have been the product
ofthe age. Possibly the single earlier example is the old word
cant, which dates back to the Middle Ages, and is said to
have been born of exasperation at the whining tone adopted
by the mendicant friars in their 'chants' (cantare) . In the same
way may we not suppose that the words quoted above grew
up out of that extraordinary atmosphere of partly bovine,
partly
hypocritical,
acquiescence in unexamined dogma
which Stuart Mill hit offin his famous phrase? 1
Nevertheless, we should have to look deeper than all this
for the true causes of a change of outlook as rapid and em-
phatic as that which swept through the last century. If we
did
so, we should probably discern,
as one of the most
efficient,
that vivid
sense of orderliness and
arrangement
which had grown up during the eighteenth century, the
reverence for Reason, and especially for Reason reflected 2
1 'There is no God.—but this is a family secret'.

proceeding in varying degrees of intensity in minds all over Europe, des-
cribes Nature as a
' materialized logical process'.

in the impartial laws which govern the working ofNature.
To minds thus attuned direct intervention by the divine at
any one point in the natural process could only seem like an
intolerable liberty; and feeling as well as thought began to
revolt at the conjuring-tricks apparently reported in the
Gospels. Perhaps there is a faint indication of the new point
of view in the nineteenth-century use of the wordfreak to
describe a lusus naturae, instead of the old monster, which is
derived from the Latin 'moneo' and implies that the oddity
is sent as a divine warning or portent.
The new cosmos—a complex of matter and forces pro-
ceeding mechanically from spiral nebula to everlasting ice
—took such a firm hold on the imagination ofEurope that
labels
like
spiritualism,
spiritualist,
spiritualistic1 were em-
ployed to
describe those who believed
it was anything
more, and even
Vitalism and
Vitalist to distinguish those
who held that life, as such, had any purpose or significance.
It is a curious remark that the erection within men's imagin-
ations of this severely mechanical framework for them-
selves was accompanied by, and may have been partly
responsible for, an increase in their sense of self-conscious-
ness. The more automatic the cosmos, apparently, the more
the vital ego must needs feel itselfdetached. At any rate, we
find upwards of forty words hyphened with selfcreated in
the nineteenth century, and of these only about six

middle of the nineteenth century, and the modern 'table-rapping' implica-

.) are mechanical. Nor was it only
the material world from which men felt themselves more
aloof. Herbert Spencer remarked on the recent extension of
the meaning of the word phenomenon to cover the thoughts
of human beings—a point of view which suggests an in-
creased degree ofdetachment even from thought itself; and
an enormous number of words with terminations such as
-ism, -ist, -ite, -ology, -arian, are indications of a more con-
templative attitude to all that we ourselves do and feel and'
think. What a difference between being feminine and being
a feminist, between hope and optimism, romance and roman-
ticism, between Christianity and Christology, between liking
vegetables and being a vegetarian ! We are hardly conscious
at all of being human, more so of being humane, more still
ofbeing humanitarian, and very conscious indeed of human-
itarianism.
Detachment, however, spells freedom; and words are not
wanting to remind us of that enhanced sense ofthe value of
individual liberty which now found expression in the writ-
ings ofthe great Romantics and ofmen likeJohn Stuart Mill.
Autonomy had not been applied to individuals, but only to
states and societies, until the close of the eighteenth century,
and in the following century the adjective autonomous was
introduced. We may compare liberalism and liberal-minded
with the old libertine; authoritarian implies a feeling in him
who uses the word that all authority, as such, is bad; the nine-
teenth century also saw the distinction between broad-minded
and narrow-minded, and between obscurantism and enlighten-
ment—aword which met with some opposition, according to
FitzEdward Hall, who records in his Modern English (1873)
that:
198

Mechanism
'Enlightenment is, to this day, always used by a certain
class of English writers with a manifest sneer. The writers
referred to are those who would rather have been born
under the rule of the barons than under the inchoate rule of
reason, and would gladly exchange the age of science for
the ages of faith and folly. Those who object to the word
will ordinarily be found to object to all that it stands for.'
Since the sense of freedom often appeared at its strongest
in imaginations which were most possessed with the mech-
anical view of the universe, the paradox was not infrequent
—especially in Germany—of philosophers and
scientists
insisting fiercely on the freedom of thought and using it to
deny the possibility of any freedom at all
! Such thinkers
found the word Determinism useful to express the mech-
anical part of the old predestination without the latter's theo-
logical assumptions.
Other words which seem to be connected with the same
trend of thought are those that confine themselves to ex-
pressing a sense of the worth and dignity of man, as man,
and irrespective of his cosmic connections. Such are human-
ism, 1 humanitarian, 1 humanitarianism, individualism, individu-
alist,
individualistic, and many of the self words, such
as
Carlyle's
self-help, or the semantic change of self-respect,
which is first recorded as used with a praiseworthy meaning
in Wordsworth's Prelude. Now the consciousness of the
absolute value and infinite potentiality of each human soul
is revealed, as we saw, by the words in which it first began
to take verbal form, as having been essentially an attribute
of Christianity. Yet how differently these nineteenth-cen-

doctrine that Christ was a merely human figure.

tury words sound from the Christian vocabulary of the
human and
social
virtues
charity,
lovingkindness,
mercy,
pity, and the like! The modern words seem to be related
to these glowing old Christian terms as the unemphasized,
because unquestioned, mutual affection of a happy couple
is related to the voluble ardours of courting. They pre-
serve, we may say—they have even greatly developed
that divine sense of the value and autonomy of each indi-
vidual human soul. But it is now more of a political auto-
nomy. It is as though they respected it rather from a manly
sense of obligation, and the sense of obligation is even ex-
tended,
as we see in the later semantic development of
humane, humanity, and humanitarian, to the brutes.
Thus, if the one outlook is indeed a lineal descendant of
the other, we are constrained to ask a little sadly what had
become of a certain sunny element,
a suppressed poetic
energy, a wonder and a wild surprise, which lurks in the
former words, but somehow—with
all our
respect
for
them—not in the latter. And for light upon this question
we must turn to yet another group ofwords—small, yet of
such far-reaching implications as to demand a final chapter
to themselves.

Early
Christianity, with its delighted recognition of
the soul's reality,
its awful consciousness of inner
depths unplumbed, had produced, as we saw, many
words
describing human emotions by
their
effects, and
especially by
their
effects on
the
soul's
relation
to
the
Divine. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with the
increase of self-consciousness among the leisured classes, a
more sympathetic, 'introspective' 1 attitude to the emotions
grew up, and
this we traced to
its development in the
romantic sensibility of the seventeenth and eighteenth cen-
turies. How did
it fare, then, with this tender nursling in
the years that followed? Was it crushed and dissected into a
neatly labelled little corpse, or was it suffered to grow up
unchecked, uneducated, into the middle-aged and well-fed
sentimentalism of our Victorian
ancestors?
Fortunately
it
avoided both these fates. Carefully tended by small groups
ofearnest men, now in this academy and now in that, it had
escaped the dissection of Nature because it had learned not

to draw
its nourishment from Nature and the God of
Nature, but from man himself. And on
this
diet
it had
thriven and waxed until
it was a veritable young
giant,
able to stand up and confront Nature as her equal. But we
must retrace our steps a little.
Attentive
readers of Jane
Austen's
novels
will have
noticed the slightly unfamiliar way in which she employs
the two words romantic and picturesque. A closer examina-
tion reveals the fact that in her time they still bore traces of
their
origin. These
adjectives
are taken from
the
arts,
romantic meaning in the first instance 'like the old Rom-
ances', and picturesque 'like a picture' or 'reminding one of
a picture'. They are thus members of a quite considerable
group ofwords and phrases, attitude , comic, dramatic, lyrical,
melodramatic, point of view, and the
like, in which terms
taken in the first place from the arts are subsequently ap-
plied to life. Nowadays we sometimes go farther and use
the name of a particular artist, speaking, for instance, of a
Turneresque sunset, a Praxitelean shape; or we even call to
our
aid
a
writer's
fictitious
creatures,
as
in
' Falstaffian
morality',
'the
Pickwickian
sense',
.
.
. Such
a
figure of
speech looks at first sight like any other kind of imagery,
and we perhaps imagine it in use since the beginnings ofart.
In point of fact, however,
it
is probable that
it was not
known before the time of the Renaissance, when men's
notions of art changed so suddenly, when, indeed,
their
very consciousness of it as a separate, unrelated activity,
something which can be distinguished in thought from a
'craft', a 'trade', or a religious ceremony, seems to have
first sprung into being. Moreover, the ancient word
art
used to include in its purview not only these meanings, but
202

Imagination
also most of those which we now group under the heading
science.
In
the Middle Ages
the
Seven
Liberal
Arts1—
Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and
Astronomy—were contrasted with the 'servile' or 'mech-
anical' arts—that is, handicrafts involving manual labour.
And thus, though art in this wide sense
is old,
artist first

Sir Philip
Sidney's Apologie for Poetry.
Artisan
appeared at about the same time, and was not then, as now,
confined to mechanical and manual labourers.
O, what a world ofprofit and delight
wrote the poet, Marlowe,
Is promisd to the studious artisan.
In the light of two or three familiar words let us try and
trace the development, from Sidney's time onwards, of
some of our modern notions of 'art', and in particular of
poetry. Criticism—the branch of literature or journalism
with which our
daily and weekly reviews make
us
so
familiar—does not date very
far back into the
past.
Its
parents were the medieval arts of grammar and philology,
which, among the commentators on
classical
texts, had
already sometimes blossomed into the rudiments of aesthe-
tic. The actual words critic and critical, however, have been
traced no farther back than Shakespeare; critic in its aesthetic
sense
is first found in Bacon; and criticism and criticize are
neither ofthem earlier than the seventeenth century. Based
for the most part on Aristotle's
Poetics,
serious criticism
began to take shape in England at the Renaissance. From

Imagination
Elizabethan
critical
essays, such
as
Sidney's Apologie for
Poetry, we can get an idea of the light in which poetry and
the other
arts had begun to be viewed at that time. To
Sidney,
for example,
the distinguishing mark of poetry
was, not metre, but a certain 'feigning'. The first philo-
sophers and historians, he affirmed, were also poets, not
indeed because of what we should magnificently call their
'creative imagination', but simply because they 'invented'
certain fictitious persons and events. We should not now
regard
this
as a virtue in an historian. Sidney, however,
points out the derivation ofpoetry from the Greek 'poiein',
'to make', 1 and shows how this distinguishes it from all the
other arts and sciences, which in the last analysis merely
' follow Nature', while only the poet,
'disdaining to be tied to any such subjection, lifted with the
vigour of his own invention, doth grow in effect another
nature, in making things either better than Nature bringeth
forth, or, quite anew, forms such as never were in Nature,
as the Heroes, Demigods, Cyclops, Chimeras, Furies, and
such like: so as he goeth hand in hand with Nature, not
enclosed within the narrow warrant of her gifts, but freely
ranging only within the Zodiac ofhis own wit.'
And Sidney adds that this fact is not to be made light of
merely because the works of Nature are 'essential' while
the poet's are only 'in imitation or fiction'. The poet has
contemplated the
'Ideas' behind Nature, and
it
is those
which he 'delivers forth, as he hath imagined them'. With
1 Poets were regularly called makers in the fourteenth and fifteenth cen-
turies. 'I know not', says Sidney, 'whether by luck or wisdom we English-
men have met with the Greeks in calling him a " maker".'

ten or twenty new novels appearing on the bookstalls every
week it is not so easy for us to realize the dignity and glory
which were once
felt
to
distinguish
this
great human
achievement offiction—that is, of 'making' or 'making up'
(from the Latin
'fingere',
to 'form' or 'make') purely
imaginary forms, instead ofmerely copying Nature.
Now the presence ofa made-up element, especially when
it comprised supernatural beings such as giants and fairies,
was
held
to
be one of the
distinguishing marks of a
romance. The old medieval romances,
as their name sug-
gests, had been nursed to life in that curious period of con-
tact between Roman and Celtic myth which also gave us
such words asfairy and sorcery.
1 They were so called because
they were written or recited in the romance vernacular 2
instead of in literary Latin, and they seem to have deve-
loped out of an increasing tendency among the medieval
bards to embroider, on their own responsibility, the tradi-
tional accounts of historical and mythical events. This ten-
dency, wherever it had hitherto been detected among the
western Aryans, had been strenuously opposed in the inter-
ests oflearning and morality. It was one of the reasons why
Plato decided to expel poets from Ins Republic, and
it
is
remarkable
that the
earlier uses of a word
like fable in
twelfth- and
thirteenth-century French and
fourteenth-
century English should have been all condemnatory. Now
by the time the Renaissance dawned on England this word
had come to be applied, in one instance at least, not merely
to the embroidery, but to the garment itself, so that, for

poets'. And after the Revival of Learning, when the most
able men began to have a very different feeling towards the
myths of Greece and Rome, such a phrase became the very
opposite of disparaging. Fiction and romance were gradually
recognized
as
a legitimate and noble expression of the
human spirit.
Gradually: to Sidney, poetry was
still, after Aristotle's
definition, 'an art of imitation'; only poets must 'to imi-
tate, borrow nothing ofwhat is, hath been, or shall be, but
range
.
.
. into the divine consideration ofwhat may be and
should be'. And during the seventeenth century all art con-
tinued to be regarded
as imitation, of which, however,
there were two kinds—the imitation of other arts and the
imitation of Nature herself. The second kind, by analogy
from picture-dealing, was called original, and the faculty
which achieved it was named invention
(Latin, 'invenire',
'to find'), a word implying that something had been found
in Nature which had not yet been imitated by man. Early
in the eighteenth century the substantive
originality was
formed from original, and an increasing importance began
to be attached to the element of novelty in experiences of
all kinds, Addison placing it on a level with greatness and
beauty as a source ofpleasure to the imagination.
At the same time another word appeared in the vocabu-
lary ofaesthetic criticism. An Elizabethan critic had already
pointed out that, if poets could indeed spin their poetry
entirely out of themselves, they were as 'creating gods', and
Dryden soon used the same verb of Shakespeare, because,
in Caliban, he had invented
' a person not in Nature'. So also
Addison:
206

Imagination
'.
.
. this Talent, of affecting the Imagination
.
.
. has some-
thing in it like Creation: It bestows a kind ofExistence, and
draws up to the Reader's View several Objects which are
not to be found in Being.
It makes Additions to Nature,
and gives greater Variety to God's Works.'
This word, too, with its derivative creative, is used far too
often and too lightly 1 now to allow us to easily perceive its
importance. 'Creare' was one of those old Latin words
which had been impregnated through the Septuagint and
the Vulgate with Hebraic and Christian associations;
its
constant use in ecclesiastical Latin had saturated it with the
special meaning of creating, in divine fashion, out of no-
thing,
as opposed
to
the merely human making, which
signified the rearrangement of matter already created, or
the imitation of 'creatures'. The application ofsuch a word
to human activities seems to mark a pronounced change in
our attitude towards ourselves, and it is not surprising that,
in the course ofits career, the new use should have met with
some opposition on the grounds ofblasphemy.
Once
established, however,
the conception
evidently
reacted on other terms embodying theories of art, such, for
example,
as
original and
originality
(already mentioned),
art,
artist, genius, imagination,
inspiration, poesy, poetry, and
others. The meaning which inspiration possessed up to the
seventeenth or eighteenth centuries carries us right back to
the old mythical outlook in Greece and elsewhere, when
poets and prophets were understood to be the direct mouth-
pieces of superior beings—beings such as the Muses, who
1 London emporiums even advertise themselves in chatty essays entitled
The Creative Aspect ofa Store.
207

Imagination
inspired or 'breathed into' them the divine afflatus. Through
Plato and Aristotle this conception came to England at the
Renaissance and lasted as an element of aesthetic theory
well on into the eighteenth century, if it can be said to have
died out altogether even now. But,
like so many other
words, this one began in the seventeenth century to suffer
that process which we have called 'internalization'. Hobbes
poured etymologically apposite scorn on the senseless con-
vention 'by which a man, enabled to speak wisely from the
principles of Nature and his own meditation, loves rather
to be thought to speak by inspiration, like a Bagpipe'. And
we may suppose that from about this time inspiration, like
some of the 'character' words which we traced in a pre-
vious chapter, began to lose its old literal meaning and to
acquire
its modern and metaphorical one. Like
instinct,
it
was now
felt, whatever
its real nature, to be something
arising from within the human being rather than some-
thing instilled from without.
Such a revised notion of the immediate source ofhuman
activities
inevitably concentrated
attention on
the
indi-
vidual artist—a fact which may perhaps be reflected in the
use from the seventeenth century onwards of the word
genius to describe not merely the 'creative' faculty, but its
possessor. For we can speak now of such and such a man
being
' a genius' . This little word, on which a whole chapter
might be written, comes from the Latin 'genius'
1 (from

tions having been merely imported by the hostility and superstition of early
Christianity. Socrates, for instance, attributed all his wisdom to his 'daimo-
nion\ andgenius must undoubtedly have been affected by this word through
the assiduous translation of Greek philosophy into Latin

101).

Imagination
'gign-o',
'to bring into being', a stem appearing also in
ingenious, engine,
.
.
.), which in Roman mythology meant
a person's tutelary
spirit, or special angel attending him
everywhere and influencing his thoughts and actions.
Its
early meaning in English was much the same as that of
talent, 1 which, of course, takes its meaning from the New
Testament parable. That is to say, genius signified an ability
implanted in a man by God at his birth. But from about the
seventeenth century
this meaning began to ferment and
expand in the most extraordinary way; it was distinguished
from, and even opposed to, talent, and in the following cen-
tury its force and suggestiveness were much enhanced by
the use which was made of it to translate the Arabic
' Djinn ',
a powerful supernatural being. Although nowadays we
generally distinguish this particular sense by the spelling
Genie, the temporary fusion ofmeanings certainly deepened
the strength and mystery of the older word, and may even
have procreated
the
later Byronic
tradition of mighty,
lonely poets with open necks and long hair and a plethora
ofmistresses and daguerreotypes.
Before, however, these words could acquire the potent
meanings which they bear today, they had
to run the
gauntlet of the Age of Reason, with its hatred of all that
savours ofenthusiasm and fanaticism. And it was out of the
ridicule and distrust which they encountered at
its hands
that
the important new
epithet
romantic,
together with
some obsolete terms like romancy, romancical,. romantical,
.
.
.
was born. With its meaning of 'like the old romances' (and
therefore barbarous, fantastic), romantic was one of those
adjectives, like enthusiastic, extravagant, Gothic, by which the

later
seventeenth, and
the eighteenth century expressed
their disapproval of everything which did not bear the
stamp of reason and polite society.
It was soon applied to
people whose heads were stuffed out with the ballooning
extravagancies of the old romances, just as enthusiastic was
employed to describe superstitious people who believed
themselves distended with a special variety of divine in-
spiration. Above
all,
it had the sense of fabulous, unreal,
unnatural. 'Can anything,' asked Bishop South, 'be ima-
gined more
profane
and
impious,
absurd,
and
indeed
romantic?' But at the beginning of the eighteenth century
this meaning developed a little farther. Romantic was now
used of places, or aspects of Nature, of the kind among
which the old Romances had been set. It was noticed that
'romantic' people displayed a preference for wild land-
scapes and ruined
castles, and would even 'fancy'
these
things, where more rational people could see nothing more
exciting
than
a tumbledown
barn
and
a
dirty
ditch.
And
it
is this particular shade of meaning, together with
a
strong
suggestion of absurdity
and
unreality,
which
the word
seems
still to have conveyed to Jane
Austen,
who preferred
to
use
picturesque
in contexts where we
should now employ
romantic
in
its approving or non-
committal sense.
Had one of her heroines, however, succeeded in emerg-
ing from that endless round of incredibly dull
activities
which she contrives to make so incredibly interesting, and
had
this
enterprising young woman then attempted
to
breast the intellectual currents of the age, she would have
been startled to find that that sarcastic consciousness of a
war between sense and sensibility, which was her creator's
210

Imagination
inspiration, was a spent stream flowing from the remote
past. For while echoes of the original thinking of men like
Bacon, Hobbes, and Locke continued to rumble and rever-
berate on in the disparaging implications carried by a word
like romantic, a new note had already become audible be-
neath them as long ago as the beginning of the century.
It
was an undertone of reluctant approval. These 'romantic*
notions might be absurd, but they were at least pleasant.
'We do not care for seeing through the falsehood', wrote
Addison, 'and willingly give ourselves up to so agreeable
an imposture.'
It was in the second half of the eighteenth century that
this aesthetic 1 vocabulary
genius,
original, romantic,
.
.
.
whose meanings had up
to
the present been developed
largely by the English, began to make a stir on the Conti-
nent. The words were talked ofin France; they were taken
up by the critics, poets, and philosophers of Germany; and
after much handling by men like Kant, Hegel, Schelling,
Goethe, and
others,
the
further and
partly popularized
meanings which they thus acquired were, in a sense, again
inserted into their English forms by one or two Englishmen
who, towards the close of the century, felt a strong affinity
between their own impulses and the Sturm una
1 Drang which
had been agitating Germany. The most influential of these
was Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and just before the turn of
the century there burst, with his help, upon England that
1 To the beginning of this period in Germany we owe the word aesthetic,
which we take from the German philosopher Baumgarten's use of 'aesthe-
tik' to describe a 'criticism of taste' considered as part of a complete philo-
sophy. Needless to say, the word chosen (Greek 'aisthetos', 'perceived by
the senses') bears a relation to the nature ofBaumgarten's theory.
211

Imagination
strange explosion which received, naturally enough, the
name of the Romantic Movement. At first it took the form
of a sort of cult of the Middle Ages. Ballad is another word
which added several cubits to
its stature by travelling in
France and Germany, where it also gave birth to the musi-
cal ballade; and we find medieval words like
bard, foray,
gramarye1
(and
its Scotch
derivative, glamour), and
raid,
revived by Walter Scott after having fallen out of use for
two or three hundred years. Derring-do—another of these
revivals—is interesting because it originates in a mistake
made by Spenser about Chaucer. He had described how
Troilus was second to nobody in
' derring do that longeth
to a knight'—that
is to say,
'in daring to do that which
belongs to a knight'—or, in Cornish idiom, 'that which a
knight "belongs to do"'.
It
is easy to see the nature of
Spenser's error. The mysterious substantive derring-do (des-
perate courage), which he created and used several times, is
not found again until Scott's Ivanhoe.
Very soon the Romantic Movement was
resuscitating
the Elizabethan world as well as the 'Gothic'—a word, by
the way, which now, for the first time in its history, began
to connote approval. It was Coleridge himselfwho invented
the word Elizabethan, and his inspiring lectures on Shake-
speare must be very largely responsible for that renewed
and deepened interest in the great dramatist in which Ger-
many once more set us the example. It is also noteworthy
that
the word fitful, which
Shakespeare
had
probably
coined in the famous line from Macbeth, was never used
again until the close of the eighteenth century; and another
word which expired when the Elizabethan spirit expired in
1 See p. 130.
212

Imagination
Milton, to be resurrected
in
the
nineteenth
century,
is
faery, with that
spelling, and with the meaning, not so
much of an
individual
sprite
as of a magic realm or
state of being—almost
' the whole
supernatural
element
in romance'.
This supernatural element—as we saw in the history of
the words creative and genius—is connected very intimately
indeed with the origin of the Romantic Movement. And
we shall see the connection even more clearly in the seman-
tic development of two more words—the last to be exam-
ined in this book—fancy and imagination. The various Greek
words which
the
Latin
'imago' was
used
to
translate
acquired their special meanings among the Stoics, where,
as we saw in Chapter VI, that teasing sense of a contrast,
a lack of connection, between the 'objective' and 'sub-
jective' worlds appears
first to have developed. One of
these words was 'phantasia', from which we have taken
indirectly the divergent forms fantasy, phantasy, and fancy.
In
the
first century
a.d.
the Greek
'phantasia' was
pre-
dominantly used, so we are told, 'in cases where, carried
away by enthusiasm and passion, you think you see what
you describe, and you place
it before the eyes of your
hearers'. 1 'Phantasia' and 'imaginatio' were in use among
the Schoolmen, andfantasy and imagination are both found
in Chaucer in the sense of 'a mental image or reflection',
or more particularly
' an image of something which either
has no real existence or does not yet exist'. After the Renais-
sance Shakespeare suddenly transfigured one of the two
words in one of those extraordinary passages which make
1 Longinus, On the Sublime, a treatise which exerted a remarkable influence
on English criticism from the time ofDryden onwards.

Imagination
us feel that genius is indeed something more than earthly:
And as imagination bodiesforth
Theforms ofthings unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shapes andgives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.
In such a passage we seem to behold him standing up, a
figure of colossal stature, gazing at us over the heads of the
intervening generations. He transcends the flight of time
and the laborious building up ofmeanings, and, picking up
a part of the outlook of an age which is to succeed his by
nearly two hundred years, gives it momentary expression
before he lets it drop again. That mystical conceptionwhich
the word embodies in
these
lines—a conception which
would make imagination the interpreter and part creator
of a whole unseen world—is not found again until the
Romantic Movement has begun.
And then
it had to be reached slowly. Seventy years
after Shakespeare wrote we find the philosopher, Henry
More, cautiously distinguishing from other kinds of ima-
gination
' that Imagination which is most free, such as we
use in Romantick Inventions ' .
' Imagining', wrote Dryden,
'is in itself the very height and life of poetry'; and in 1 712
Addison published
in
the
Spectator
his
papers on 'The
Pleasures of the Imagination', in which he used the two
words fancy and imagination synonymously, describing in
one of the essays how, because of the faculty ofwhich they
are the names,
'.
.
. our Souls are at present delightfully lost and bewildered
in a pleasing Delusion, and we walk about like the in-
o
214

Imagination
chanted Hero of a Romance, who sees beautiful
Castles,
Woods, and Meadows; and
at the same time hears the
warbling ofBirds, and the purling of Streams; but upon the
finishing ofsome secret Spell, the fantastic Scene breaks up,
and
the
disconsolate Knight
finds himself on
a barren
Heath, or in a solitary Desart.
The tendency among critics to use this sort of imagery,
or words suggestive of it, when writing of thefancy and the
imagination, rapidly increased. Dryden had already distin-
guished the
'fairy' way of writing, and from Addison's
time we constantly hear writers and their art referred to in
terms of fairyland,
enchantments,
magic,
spells,
wands,
.
.
.
Shakespeare, we are told by one writer, is
' a more powerful
magician than his own Prospero'. 'The world is worn out
to us,' wrote Young. 'Where are its formerly sweet delu-
sions, its airy castles, and glittering spires? ' And five years
later he assured us that
' the pen of an original writer, like
Armida's wand, out of a barren waste
calls a blooming
spring'.
But as the Romantic impulse grew older and crystallized
into a philosophy—when the child which had germinated,
as
feeling, among
the
ignorant many who
spoke
the
Romance languages, after passing through its Elizabethan
adolescence, achieved self-conscious maturity, as thought,
among the learned few who were familiar with the com-
plicated literary languages of modern Europe—the need
was felt for some way of distinguishing what were merely
'sweet delusions' from the more perdurable productions of
the Romantic
spirit. And this Coleridge achieved by his
famous distinction between fancy and imagination. Fancy,
215

Imagination
since
his day, has meant rather the power of inventing
illustrative imagery—the playful adornment, as it were, of
Nature; but imagination is the power ofcreating from with-
in forms which themselves become a part of Nature
'Forms', as Shelley put it,
more real than living man,
Nurslings ofimmortality.
The next step in the meaning of this word was really
taken on the day upon which Coleridge, with his head full
of ancient witchery, was introduced to another poet with
his heart full of mountains. Under their joint influence we
can behold that despised habit oflooking at life through the
spectacles of the old Romances, the mysterious faculty of
superimposing on
Nature
a magical
colour
or mood
created in the observer by thefictions ofgenius or the myths
of bygone ages, expanding until
it includes the contem-
plation of Nature impassioned by any
effluence
arising
from within—it may be emotion or
it may be the indi-
vidual memory. It was the philosophy of the Lake School
that the perception of Nature—that
is
to
say of all in
Nature that is not purely mechanical—depends upon what
is brought to it by the observer. Deep must call unto deep.
To a creation apprehended as automatic by the senses and
the reason, only imagination could
Add the gleam,
The light that never was on sea or land;
for imagination was 'essentially vital, even as all objects (as
objects) are essentially fixed and dead'. 1
1 Coleridge: Biographia Literaria.
216

Imagination
Imagination was, in fact, organic; and the application of
this adjective to the inner world has not been traced farther
back than Coleridge, who, in his lectures on Shakespeare's
plays, emphasized the mistake of confounding 'mechanical
regularity with organic form'. But perhaps the most bril-
liant, even epigrammatic, expression which has ever been
given
to
the
everlasting war between
the unconscious,
because creative, vital principle and the conscious, because
destructive, calculating principle, is contained in four lines
from
a
little poem of Wordsworth's
called
The
Tables
Turned:
Sweet is the lore which nature brings:
Our meddling intellect
Mis-shapes the beauteousforms ofthings—
We murder to dissect.
And so it is in the philosophy and poetry of Romanti-
cism that we first feel a true understanding, not indeed of
the process itself, but of the results of that process, which
has been traced in this book under the name of 'internal-
ization'.
Slowly the divers of the Romantic
expedition
brought up to the surface of consciousness that vast new
cosmos which had so long been blindly forming in the
depths. It was a cosmos in which the spirit and spontaneity
of life had moved out of Nature and into man. The magic
of Persia, the Muses of Greece, the witches and fairies and
charms and enchantments of Romance—all these had been
locked safely in man's bosom, there to sleep until the trump
of Romanticism sounded
its
call to imagination to give
back their teeming life to Nature. 'O Lady', wrote Coler-
idge in that most heartrending of all poems, wherein, like
2/7

Imagination
the disconsolate knight awaking on the barren heath, he
reports the decay in himselfof this very power:
O Lady! we receive but what we give,
And in our life alone does nature live:
Ours is her wedding-garment, ours her shroud!
And would we aught behold, ofhigher worth,
Than that inanimate cold world allowed
To the poor loveless, ever-anxious crowd,
Ah!from the soul itselfmust issueforth
A light, a glory, afair luminous cloud
Enveloping the Earth—
Andfrom the soul itselfmust there be sent
A sweet andpotent voice, ofits own birth,
Ofall sweet sounds the life and element.
And this re-animation of Nature was possible because the
imagination was felt as creative in the full religious sense of
the word. It had itself assisted in creating the natural forms
which the senses were now contemplating.
It had moved
upon the face of the waters. For it was 'the repetition in the
finite mind of the eternal act of creation'—the Word made
human.
In tracing the semantic history of important words like
these, we must not forget that nine-tenths of the words
comprising the vocabulary of a civilized nation are never
used by more than at most one-tenth of the population;
while of the remaining tithe nine-tenths of those who use
them are commonly aware of about one-tenth of
their
meanings. Nevertheless it isjust by following those meanings
to the high-water mark which they have reached in a few
eager minds that we can observe what may fairly be called
218

Imagination
changes in the general consciousness. It is true that the new
meanings must
filter through a graduated hierarchy of
imaginative
literature,
literary journalism,
reviews,
ser-
mons, journalism, popular novels, advertisements, radio,
and cinema captions before what is left of them reaches the
general public; but the amount that
is
left, and the spell
which is accordingly exerted on the many, depends on how
far they have first been carried by the few. A hundred and
fifty or more years ago, when mountains were still 'horrid',
the
foundations
of the
present economic
structure
of
Switzerland were being quietly laid by the dreams of a few
Lake poets and their brother Romantics. And incidentally
the extraordinary load ofmeaning often borne by the word
dream itself, in phrases like dreamland, my dreams, the land of
my dreams, ... is no doubt traceable ultimately to the use of
this word by the great Romantics. When Shelley wrote:
Through the cold mass
Ofmarble and ofcolour his1 dreams pass
.
.
.
and
He hath awakenedfrom the dream oflife
.
.
.
he was also, we might say, writing the greater part of a
good many twentieth-century drawing-room ballads.
Others today are fascinated by their dreams, because they
regard them
as messengers from
that mysterious inner
world in which, like the Christians of old, they are begin-
ning
to
divine
depths
hitherto
unimagined. They
feel
'forces' at work there which they are tempted to personify
in terms ofancient myth
Ahriman, Lucifer, Oedipus, Psyche,
1 I.e. man's; the allusion is, of course, to plastic and visual art.
219

Imagination
and
the
like. But
outside
the
significant
adjective
sub-
conscious, which has almost certainly come
to
stay,
the
effect which such
tendencies may have on
the English
language remains a tale to be told a hundred years hence.
The numerous secondary implications unfolding within
dream, however,
its popularity, and its obvious power of
suggesting images, must interest us as further symptoms of
a now almost universal consciousness of at any rate the
existence ofsuch an 'inner' world. In some lines written as
a preface to the Recluse—the long, unfinished philosophical
poem ofwhich the Prelude and the Excursion were to form
parts—Wordsworth has described the holy awe which he,
for one, entertained as he realized that he must now set out
to explore this world:
Urania, I shall need
Thy guidance, or a greater Muse, ifsuch
Descend to earth or dwell in highest heaven!
For I must tread on shadowy ground, must sink
Deep—and, aloft ascending, breathe in worlds
To which the heaven ofheavens is but a veil.
All strength—all terror, single or in bands,
That ever was putforth in personalform—
Jehovah—with his thunder, and the choir
Ofshouting Angels, and the empyreal thrones,
Ipass them unalarmed. Not Chaos, not
The darkest pit oflowest Erebus,
Nor aught ofblinder vacancy, scooped out
By help ofdreams—can breed suchfear and awe
Asfall upon us often when we look
Into our Minds, into the Mind ofMan—
My haunt, and the main region ofmy song.
220

AFTERWORD
So
many books on words have appeared since the
first edition of History in English Words that it would
be a mistake to attempt a bibliography. The follow-
ing remarks introduced the brief, selective and inadequate
bibliography which was appended to the first edition.
'The immense debt which the foregoing pages owe to
the Oxford English Dictionary—now practically complete
is,
I hope, too obvious from the text to need further em-
phasis. Without
access to
that unrivalled monument of
imaginative scholarship a great deal of the first part, and
nearly all the second part, of this book could never have
been even attempted. Readers who wish to study history
in English words for themselves should lose no opportunity
of consulting its fascinating volumes. And in case the fear
of wearisome
repetition
has induced me
to
mislead,
I
should like to take advantage of this opening to point out
that
the O.E.D.
is
the
authority
for
practically
all
the
English etymological and semantic material on which my
book
is based. For example, the incautious but conveni-
ently brief statement that such a word "was first used by"
Chaucer or
"first appeared in"
the fourteenth century
must be regarded
as
the abbreviated form of a longer
statement to the effect that the earliest illustrative quotation
given in the O.E.D. under the heading of the word in
221

Afterword
question is drawn from Chaucer or from a book written
during that century.
' On the subject as a whole—history, and the outlook of
men upon the world, as they are embodied in the histories
ofwords—comparatively few people seem to have written
in English. Trench led the way with his little book On the
Study of Words, which
is interesting, both for itself and
because the Archbishop was the first to attach as much or
more importance to the semantic than to the etymological
side of his subject, being, in fact, himself the originator of
the Oxford Dictionary. Max Miiller's numerous essays and
writings are fresh and keen and full ofinterest. The material
adduced by both these writers should always be verified by
reference to the Dictionary.
'I do not know if anyone has hitherto attempted to treat
the subject chronologically and systematically, apart from
one
solitary English writer, Mr.
Pearsall Smith. To
his
invaluable little book, The English Language (Home Uni-
versity Library),
I am indebted throughout, not only for
very much of my material, but also for many extremely
fruitful suggestions as to the best way of dealing with
it.
I have
also made extensive use of two
essays
('English
Words Abroad' and 'Four Romantic Words'), printed in
Words and Idioms (Constable), of which, as of The English
Language,
it would, in my opinion, be very
difficult to
speak too highly, partly because of the imaginative treat-
ment of the material and partly because of its solid back-
ground ofcareful scholarship and wide reading. It is a great
pleasure to acknowledge here the more direct and personal
help which I have been fortunate enough to receive from
time to time from this distinguished writer.
222

Afterword
* For the rest, I have attempted to skim over such a wide
area that a
full bibliography
is impossible. As an intro-
duction to a closer study of the English language, the late
Henry Bradley's The Making ofEnglish is practically indis-
pensable. Skeat's Etymological Dictionary and Concise Etymo-
logical Dictionary (of which it is important to get the latest
editions), and Weekly's Etymological Dictionary of Modern
English are extremely useful works of reference, while for
those who wish to acquire some sort offeeling for the rela-
tionship between apparently dissimilar Aryan words, such
as wheel and 'kuklos', brother and 'frater', Skeat's Primer of
Classical and English Philology (Clarendon Press) is inexpen-
sive, brief, and to the point
'
'It remains to add that such efficiency and precision as
this little volume may possess have been increased by the
kindness ofmy wife, who assisted me in the irksome task of
indexing it, and of my father, who undertook the equally
exacting business ofreading the sheets.'

its remotest Aryan origins, in the
.
English language as we now have
it.

sound.
.In
the
second
part,
Mr.
Barfield
traces
the
history
of
Western thought and feeling as reflected in the changes of langu
in the introduction of neWvwords, and, what
is perhaps more im-
ji
portant, the gradual introduction offrew meanings for old words,

'The most interesting book about words

It
is astonishing
to
realize
what a tremendous and widespread effect Christianity has had on
words.
.

nearly every page of
this book has something. to

prise and often amuse, and yet
it carries .on^gre'at theme of the
