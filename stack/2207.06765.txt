In this work we show how FibLang, a category-theoretic framework concerned with
the interplay between language and meaning, can be used to describe vocabulary
acquisition, that is the process with which a speaker 𝑝acquires new vocabulary (through
experience or interaction).
We model two diﬀerent kinds of vocabulary acquisition, which we call ‘by example’
and ‘by paraphrasis’. The former captures the idea of acquiring the meaning of a word
by being shown a witness representing that word, as in ‘understanding what a cat is,
by looking at a cat’. The latter captures the idea of acquiring meaning by listening to
some other speaker rephrasing the word with others already known to the learner.
We provide a category-theoretic model for vocabulary acquisition by paraphrasis
based on the construction of free promonads. We draw parallels between our work
and Wittgenstein’s dynamical approach to language, commonly known as ’language
games’.

Introduction
Language has always been characterised as a distinctive, exclusive feature of human beings,
yet children are not born ﬂuent in any language at all. Along the history of human thought,
this apparent discrepancy has promptly led to philosophical speculation on the innateness of
language [24], which was subsequently replaced with a more cautious theory of innateness
of syntactic structures [6]. On the other hand, empiricists such as J. Locke [23] argued that
the human mind had to be thought of as a tabula rasa.
Either way, these heterogeneous philosophical stances share the necessity of formalising
a common process: language acquisition, i.e. the process in which proﬁciency in a language

increases with time or solicitation.1 Although years of debate in linguistics have not come to
a deﬁnite resolution yet, the transformationalist orientation of Chomsky has received severe
criticism in the 20th century with the growing development of linguistic philosophy and with
the renewed interest in L. Wittgenstein’s ideas.
In particular, Chomsky’s model of language acquisition has been accused of being
overly reductionist and mechanical [29], as opposed to Wittgenstein’s dynamic theory that
embraces context as a fundamental aspect of meaning analysis [34, 33].
In this latter perspective, syntax and semantics must interact and reciprocally inﬂuence
each other during communication, a process also referred to as a language game [5]. More
precisely, language games can serve as a tool to untie the problems of context-dependency
and ambiguity regarding words with multiple semantic interpretations.
The recently developed FibLang framework [14] takes a stab at tackling the enticing
and deep problem of language, oﬀering a category-theoretic framework concerned with
describing the interplay between meaning and structure in natural language. As a theory,
FibLang relies on ﬁbered categories [17, 25, 32, 30]; the main idea underlying FibLang is
characterizing linguistic meaning as ﬁbered over grammar.
Here we argue that Wittgenstein’s perspective hints at a ﬁbrational formalisation of
language acquisition. We will substantiate our hypothesis by formalising vocabulary acqui-
sition in FibLang and show how the context-dependency and semantic ambiguity aspects
underlying language games are organically embraced in our categorical description.
Since our ﬁbrational approach to language acquisition naturally encodes agency, it is
out-of-the-box compatible with applications to learning tasks in natural language processing
(NLP). In this sense, it also enriches the static perspective of DisCoCat [7], which by the
way, has also been recently revised using tools from categorical game theory applied to
language games in [15].
In point of fact, in more recent years, a diﬀerent framework, named DisCoCirc, has been
adopted to allow for a dynamic ﬂow between syntax and semantics [8]. Implementation
aspects regarding quantum computers suggested this switch and, as a side-eﬀect, it provides
stronger foundations to the philosophical stance of FibLang.
Structure of the paper.
In section 2, we will recall the basic deﬁnitions of FibLang.
We will then provide our description of vocabulary acquisition by example in section 3.
Subsequently, we will deﬁne the tool of explanations in section 4, and will use them to
deﬁne vocabulary acquisition by paraphrasis in section 5. Finally, at the end of section 5,
we provide a construction (cf. Construction 5.3) with which to show how our formalisation
1Here and in the rest of paper we will be referring to ﬁrst language acquisition only: although similarities
have been pointed out concerning second language acquisition, such as the silent period [10], several substantial
diﬀerences separate the two processes [16]. For instance, there is evidence that the learner’s ﬁrst language slows
the development of acquisitional sequences predicted by the Natural Order Hypothesis [18, 27]. Additionally,
according to the Critical Period Hypothesis, after puberty, lateralisation is accomplished, and reduced plasticity
of the brain can compromise the ﬂuent acquisition of a second language [3].

of vocabulary acquisition can be used to enrich grammar by appropriately acknowledging
semantic interrelations.

Rappels of FibLang
FibLang was introduced in a prior installment of this series, [14].
Its main idea can
be summarized as follows: whereas it is reasonable to believe that language has at least
some degree of compositionality, especially when describing grammar, it becomes much
more diﬃcult to substantiate this position when it comes to describe meaning. Indeed,
compositional –and especially cognitive– models of meaning such as Gärdenfors’ [12] are
prone to criticism on multiple fronts, not last the fact that a truly universal model of meaning
is very diﬃcult to deﬁne because of cultural and cognitive diﬀerences between speakers.
To circumvent these problems FibLang focuses on describing the interplay between
meaning and structure in abstract terms in a way that is agnostic to the particular model one
chooses to represent either. This vision is reiﬁed in the main idea being that a ‘language’ is
a category L of some sort, and a speaker 𝑝of a language L is a ﬁbration

E 𝑝

over L.2
The deﬁning property of a ﬁbration is that its domain E 𝑝is obtained gluing together all the
various ﬁbres E𝐿over objects of L in a coherent manner.
Borrowing from the work of Lambek [21], L represents a ‘language category’ while
borrowing from ﬁbration theory [CLLT, 2] E 𝑝, called the total category of the ﬁbration,
represents a ‘semantics category’ for the speaker 𝑝.
This semantics category could be
thought of as any sort of cognitive or distributional model of meaning for the language in
question: this is to say that we are not particularly attached to any speciﬁc model but rather
aim at the highest possible generality.
To arrive at this idea, the starting point in [14] constitutes the most general and yet
reasonable assumption one could make, namely there is some structure-preserving map
from what a speaker means to what a speaker says. Formally, this directly translates to
modelling speakers as simple functors between categories. From this, multiple reasons are
stated that lead to believe that the language category L should be treated as something that
can be explicitly modelled and studied, while E 𝑝should be treated as a black box. Then, it
is shown how every functor can be factorised into a ﬁbration via Theorem 2.4, obtaining a
more workable deﬁnition of a speaker from the very abstract one we started from.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Fibration). A functor 𝑝♯: E →C is a discrete ﬁbration (for us, just a
ﬁbration) if, for every object 𝐸in E and every morphism 𝑓: 𝐶→𝑝♯𝐸with 𝐶in C, there
exists a unique morphism ℎ: 𝐸′ →𝐸such that 𝑝♯ℎ= 𝑓.
Notation 2.2. The domain of a ﬁbration 𝑝♯: E →C is usually called the total category of
the ﬁbration, and its codomain is the base category. Given any functor 𝑝we can deﬁne the
ﬁbre of 𝑝over an object 𝐶∈C, i.e. the subcategory E𝐶= { 𝑓: 𝐸→𝐸′ | 𝑝𝑓= 1𝐶} ⊆E.
2In [14] ﬁbrations are denoted using the superscript −♯to distinguish them visually from bare functors.

Fibrational linguistics II
Intuitively, a ﬁbration is a functor 𝑝♯: E →C that realises the category E as a ‘covering’
of C, in such a way that morphisms in C can be lifted to E, to induce functions between
the ﬁbres in E, called reindexing functions. We have represented an elementary example
of ﬁbration in the following ﬁgure, with the action of the reindexing functions between the
elements in the ﬁbres made explicit. The gray rectangles are the ﬁbres of the ﬁbration.

A fundamental result in the theory of ﬁbrations that we will often use is that ﬁbrations over
a category L are equivalent to functors out of L, with codomain the category of sets and
functions. More details on the construction, and a full explanation of its usefulness for
FibLang, can be found in [14, A.6]; a classical reference for the theory of ﬁbrations is [17].
Theorem 2.3. There is a category DFib/L of ﬁbrations over a given L, where an object
is a ﬁbration

There is an equivalence of categories:

where at the right-hand side we have the category of all functors L →Set and natural trans-
formations thereof. The functor
∫
−is often called the category of elements construction,
or in its most general form the Grothendieck constuction.
Theorem 2.3 is also instrumental in pointing out how FibLang– which postulates an
approach going from meaning to language – can be made compatible with traditional
models of meaning such as DisCoCat – which postulate an approach going from language
to meaning3. Many conceptual reasons are given in [14] to prefer the meaning-to-language
approach, but Theorem 2.3 shows how the two are faces of the same medal.
As we remarked above, FibLang relies on some machinery to turn a model for speakers
consisting of simple functors into a model consisting of ﬁbrations.
The main theorem
allowing us to do so is the following:
3In the particular case of DisCoCat it would be more proper to say that the chosen approach is from grammar
to semantics. The apparent dissonance is resolved by taking into account the agnostic approach of FibLang.
The language category L can be purely grammatical, employing for instance a Lambek’s pregroup [20] as in
DisCoCat, or more expressive. Similarly, the meaning category E 𝑝for a speaker 𝑝could be purely semantical
– for instance, a distributional model or a conceptual space [12] – or more expressive.

We will make heavy use of Theorem 2.4 in the following sections to model language
acquisition.

Vocabulary acquisition by direct example
Vocabulary acquisition denotes the act of acquiring meanings for a word previously unknown
[26]. In this work, we aim to describe two main modes of vocabulary acquisition. In this
section, we focus on vocabulary acquisition by direct example: this is the easiest method
of language acquisition that we can describe and a commonly used method in children’s
education and monolingual ﬁeldwork [11, 28]: it simply works by pointing at something and
saying the word one is referring to. This process of language acquisition, as Wittgenstein
explains in [35], can serve as a primitive example of a language game.
Example 3.1. Consider the following dialogue:
alice: Look, a cat!
bob: A what?
[Alice points to a cat]
alice: That, a cat!
bob: Oh!
What happened in that ‘Oh!’ can be mathematically modelled as a colimit in the ﬁbrations
that represent Alice and Bob.

, which we will call teacher and learner, respectively.
Suppose that, for some 𝐿∈L – called the linguistic element to learn4 – we have that

𝐿= ∅. Fix a subset 𝑆⊆E 𝑝
𝐿, called an example for 𝐿. Then we can deﬁne a
new category F 𝑞as follows:
obj(F 𝑞) := obj(E𝑞) ⊔𝑆
hom(F 𝑞) := hom(E𝑞)
and a functor 𝑇: F 𝑞→L agreeing with

on every ﬁbre 𝐿′ ≠𝐿, and sending every
object of 𝑆to 𝐿. Relying on Theorem 2.4, the new ﬁbration modelling the speaker 𝑞after
4We will use the wording linguistic elements referring to words, entire sentences or something else, depending
on the model we chose for L, without committing to a particular choice. More formally, a linguistic element is
the (possibly nonfull) subcategory of L spanned by a certain choice of objects.

Fibrational linguistics II
learning 𝐿is the factorization ˜𝑞♯such that:
𝑇=  F 𝑞
𝑠
/ E ˜𝑞
˜𝑞♯/ / L.
Let us unpack this deﬁnition. We consider two speakers 𝑝,𝑞of the same language L.
Speaker 𝑞does not know the meaning of a given linguistic element which corresponds to an
object 𝐿∈L –which is why we call 𝑞learner. The ﬁbre E𝐿in E is the empty set, as 𝐿has
no meaning for 𝑞. On the other hand, speaker 𝑝has some model of meaning for 𝐿–which
is why we call 𝑝teacher, and we assume the ﬁbre E 𝑝
𝐿to be not empty.
If 𝑝points out an instance of 𝐿to 𝑞, as in Example 3.1, it is reasonable to assume that the
instance in question is itself part of the ﬁbre E 𝑝
𝐿, as 𝑝recognises the example as an instance
of the concept 𝐿. So we postulate that the example identiﬁes a subset 𝑆⊆E 𝑝
𝐿. While
following along with the example, 𝑞incorporates the set 𝑆as a ﬁbre over 𝐿by extending its
meaning.
On the intuitive side, there is no reason to claim that forcefully adding a scattered set of
notions to the ones previously mastered by a speaker is enough to let 𝑞‘understand’ that said
set of notions deﬁnes a new language term. Instead, to attain this level of understanding, 𝑞
has to build meaningful relations between the new term 𝐿and all the others they master, in
concordance with all the pre-existing relations between general terms.
On the mathematical side, there is no reason why the functor obtained by forcefully
adding a nonempty ﬁbre to a previously empty one shall remain a ﬁbration; to be such, we
must let the new ﬁbre interact well with the environment, in concordance with the hom-sets
L(𝑋, 𝐿) and L(𝐿,𝑌). This is why we consider the comprehensive factorisation of 𝑇and
take into consideration only ˜𝑞♯instead of the whole 𝑇.
Example 3.3 (A language game). Consider the following language game borrowed from
Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations [35]: a builder 𝐴asks his assistant 𝐵to pass him
the stones with which they are building, in the order 𝐴calls them out. In this situation, let
us imagine that the language they use consists of only four words: block, pillar, slab, beam.
This language game can be interpreted as a particular case of vocabulary acquisition by
example. The builder 𝐴, when requesting a slab, speciﬁes the linguistic element slab that he
wants to learn. On the other hand, the teacher 𝐵associates the right stone to the word slab
and hands it over to 𝐴. This way, the ﬁbre of 𝐴over the word slab is no longer empty since
𝐴has incorporated as part of its meaning the stone received by 𝐵.
Crucially, in the construction of Deﬁnition 3.2 we suppose that 𝑞has no meaning at all
for the word 𝐿. What if this is not the case? More generally, we can model a vocabulary
acquisition between two speakers that share some prior knowledge of 𝐿as a pushout, but this
will render necessary the introduction of some compatibility conditions. Indeed, consider

The arrow marked as 𝑢! always exists whenever E𝑞
𝐿is the empty set because of the universal
property of initial objects. Whenever E𝑞
𝐿is not empty, the arrow 𝑢! will have to be explicitly
instantiated. This must be understood as: the meaning that 𝑞has for 𝐿must be compatible
with the subset 𝑆that constitutes the meaning of the example for 𝑝. In simpler words, the
example 𝑝is making must make sense for 𝑞.

Explanations
Our task for the remainder of this work is about modelling vocabulary acquisition by
paraphrasis, which denotes the task of explaining a word by describing it with language, as
it happens in a dictionary. To do so, we ﬁrst need to model what an explanation is.
In stark contrast with works that are exclusively based on syntax, FibLang can describe
linguistic constructions that have meaning for a given speaker despite their ungrammaticality.
For example, it is a fact of life that often one can understand the meaning of unsound
sentences, such as in ‘I hungry now’: this is because every proﬁcient speaker can interpolate
what is missing in the message they receive by analysing its context, in order to build a
grammatical sentence. For that matter, this is precisely how Wittgenstein’s language games
unravel in disambiguating a sentence.
On the other hand, there are perfectly grammatical sentences, such as the famous ‘Dogs
dogs dog dog dogs’ (cf. [1]) that are grammatical (since ‘dog’ is both a verb and a noun in
English) but have no meaning when they are translated to any other speaker out of context.
This tension stems from the fact that acceptability –i.e. the fact that a sentence has a meaning
and grammaticality –the fact that a sentence is formed in observance of some generation
rules do not fully overlap (cf. [22]).
As such, leveraging a grammar-based approach to infer meaning in semantics, as in the
case of DisCoCat, is going to miss something –an important part, we say. By contrast,
the ﬁbrational approach of FibLang allows more ﬁne-grained bookkeeping: grammaticality
is completely encapsulated in the category L modelling language, whereas acceptability
comes into play in the following deﬁnitions:
Deﬁnition 4.1 (Finite category, ﬁnite diagram). A ﬁnite category is a category A having a
ﬁnite set of morphisms. A ﬁnite diagram valued in L is a functor A →L whose domain is

8
Fibrational linguistics II
a ﬁnite category.
Deﬁnition 4.2 (Explanation). Consider a speaker


. Fix moreover an object 𝐿of L.
An explanation for 𝐿according 𝑝is a ﬁnite diagram 𝐷𝐿: A →L such that the limit ˆ𝐿of
the diagram
A
𝐷𝐿/ L
∇𝑝♯/ Set
(4.1)
is a subset of the ﬁbre E 𝑝
𝐿(Here ∇−is the functor of Theorem 2.3). If ˆ𝐿= E 𝑝
𝐿, we call the
explanation exact.
Here, the functor 𝐷𝐿is picking a collection of linguistic elements in the language
intending to describe 𝐿. The ﬁniteness requirement for A stems from the obvious fact
that a linguistic sentence is always made of a ﬁnite number of words.
The linguistic
elements picked by 𝐷𝐿are then sent to the sets of sections sitting over them under 𝑝♯,
in accordance with Theorem 2.3.
In postulating that 𝑝‘knows’ how to make sense of
some given complex concept 𝐿∈L by breaking it down into some atomic constituents, it
becomes reasonable to assume that the combination of these atomic meanings – that is, the
limit ˆ𝐿– must itself be a concept representing 𝐿, and thus be a subset of the ﬁbre over
it. In light of this interpretation, an exact explanation is a selection of linguistic elements
describing the ﬁbre over 𝐿completely, that is, an explanation that more than any other,
conveys exactly all the nuances that the meaning of 𝐿can assume according to the speaker.

Remark 4.3 (Acceptability
vs.
grammaticality). As we
remarked at the beginning of
this section, a remarkable fea-
ture of Deﬁnition 4.2 is that
explanations can be ungram-
matical, as they evaluate the
acceptability and not gram-
maticality. For instance, if L
is a pregroup [20], the func-
tor 𝐷𝐿can specify a bunch of
elements that possibly do not
reduce to a sentence type.
Remark 4.4 (On the na-
ture of explanations). Expla-
nations are engineered to be
far from unique: there may be many functors 𝐷𝐿, with diﬀerent domains, satisfying the
property of Deﬁnition 4.2. This conforms to the idea that the same concept 𝐿can be ex-
plained in diﬀerent ways (the same object can be the limit of many diﬀerent diagrams) by

Genovese, Loregian, Puca
9
diﬀerent people, at diﬀerent moments in time, in diﬀerent cultures, in diﬀerent communica-
tion settings.
Interestingly, for every object 𝐿∈L, there is always an exact explanation for it by
choosing A to be the terminal category and 𝐷𝐿to be the functor picking 𝐿∈L; This
explanation is tautological, as it aﬃrms in essence that the meaning of the word ‘cat’ is
‘cat’.

Vocabulary acquisition by paraphrasis
As remarked in the opening of section 4, by vocabulary acquisition by paraphrasis we
denote the mechanism by which we give meaning to things using linguistic explanation.
This is the method of language acquisition commonly used in books and papers like this
one, in conversations with a blind man about cathedrals, and pretty much everywhere 𝑝
needs to convey the meaning of something they know to a 𝑞who does not.
Example 5.1. Consider the following dialogue:
alice: I adopted a cat!
bob: A what?
alice: You know, a cat: one of those felines.
bob: Oh, you mean, like a tiger?
alice: No: a cat is smaller and it comes in various colours, not only stripes.
Mine is black.
bob: Oh, maybe I see. A cat is like. . . a lynx.
alice: Well, almost; black cats are cursed.
bob: Ah, now I see.
Bob still has probably never seen a real cat when the dialogue ends, and he would have
trouble recognizing one. Still, he can get a rough idea of ‘a cat’ by mixing concepts for
which he already had a model of meaning.
Mathematically, what we would like to do is proceed as we did in Deﬁnition 3.2, by
incorporating an explanation as in Deﬁnition 4.2 into the ﬁbration of the learning speaker.
In short, our strategy is the following:
• 𝑝has an explanation 𝐷𝐿: A →L of some word 𝐿;
• 𝑝shares A with 𝑞. This represents the act of 𝑝uttering the explanation to 𝑞;
• 𝑞computes the limit of the diagram Aop 𝐷op
𝐿
−−−→Lop ∇𝑞♯
−−−→Set;
• 𝑞includes this limit in their own ﬁbre over 𝐿.
Diﬃculties arise in the last point. The problem we face is that an explanation is a limit, and as
such, a particular kind of cone in Set is composed not only of objects but also of morphisms.
Unfortunately, including the whole cone in the total category of a ﬁbration sometimes entails
the impossibility of deﬁning the functor 𝑇: F 𝑞→L as we did in Deﬁnition 3.2.

10
Fibrational linguistics II
Example 5.2. To see a practical example, consider the explanation as in Figure 1. Here, the
cone legs are morphisms in Set connecting concepts signifying diﬀerent nouns (for example,
from ‘cat’ to ‘feline’). If L is a Lambek pregroup, the only morphisms are reductions, so
there are no morphisms between nouns in L. Thus in including the whole cone in F 𝑞, we
could not deﬁne the functor 𝑇on the cone legs. This is related to our previous considerations
about grammaticality and acceptability: pregroups only represent grammatical connections
and fail to see conceptual relatedness. Consequently, although pregroup grammars have been
enriched to identify diﬀerently worded sentences in [9], the added relations are exquisitely
grammatical and cannot account for context.
One possible solution to this problem would be to consider only the limit itself and
proceed as in Deﬁnition 3.2. However, in doing so, we would miss the big opportunity of
adding meaning while being mindful of the context in which this meaning lives.
Another –more stimulating– solution considers Wittgenstein’s approach to language,
which we brieﬂy summarized in the introduction, and leverages the interplay between
grammar and semantics. The main idea here is to use semantics data - i.e. the limiting
cone - to enrich the grammar with new morphisms. Going back to Example 5.2, this means
adding new morphisms to the pregroup grammar L that do not represent reductions but
some sort of ‘semantic connection’ between words.
To add new morphisms to a category, we highlight the following procedure. Recall that
there is an adjunction
( ) 𝛿: Set
/ Quiv
o
: ( )0
(5.1)
sending every quiver 𝑄to the set 𝑄0 of its vertexes, and every set 𝑋to the ‘discrete quiver’
𝑋𝛿with no edges, and an adjunction
𝐹: Quiv
/ Cat
o
: 𝑈
(5.2)
sending every quiver 𝑄to the free category 𝐹𝑄generated by it, and every category C to its
underlying quiver 𝑈C.
The following construction is a recipe to add the set of edges 𝐸of a quiver 𝑄to a (small)
category C and form a category out of it when C and 𝑄have the same set of vertices.
Regarding a category as a monad in the bicategory of spans, the following Construction 5.3
consists of a particular instance of a free-monoid construction in a decent enough monoidal
category (cf. [19]).
Construction 5.3 (FP construction). Let C be a category, and 𝑄: 𝐸⇒𝐶0 a quiver over the
same set 𝐶0 of objects of C.5
• consider the underlying quiver 𝑈C of C;
5The notation is slightly overloaded here because we denote 𝑄0 the set of vertices of a quiver and 𝐶0 the set
of objects of the underlying quiver of a category C. This confusion is harmless.

Fibrational linguistics II
Remark 5.5. A more general construction for C ≀𝑄is then the following: ﬁx a monad 𝔮
as above, and consider its Kleisli object ¯C; the free part of the Kleisli adjunction yields an
identity on objects functor C →¯C. Given 𝔮, it can be highly complicated to describe its
Kleisli category; what makes this construction combinatorially tamer is that the structure
we are adding through the quiver 𝑄is free.
Now we ﬁnally have all the needed tools to deﬁne vocabulary acquisition via paraphrasis
satisfactorily.

, which we will call teacher and learner, respectively.
Suppose that, for some 𝐿∈L –called the linguistic element to learn– we have that
E 𝑝
𝐿≠∅and E𝑞
𝐿= ∅. Let 𝐷𝐿: A →L be an explanation of 𝐿according to 𝑝. Deﬁne the
category F 𝑞as L ≀𝑄, where 𝑄is the quiver obtained as follows:
• the vertices are the same of L;
• there is an edge 𝐿→𝐿′ for each limiting cone leg lim  Aop →Lop ∇𝑞♯
−−−→Set →∇𝑞♯𝐿′.
Now deﬁne a functor 𝑇: F 𝑞→Set by mapping 𝐿to ˆ𝐿𝑞and every other 𝐿′ to ∇𝑞♯(𝐿′).
On morphisms, 𝑇agrees with ∇𝑞♯wherever the latter is deﬁned and maps the newly added
edges of 𝑄to the legs of the limit ˆ𝐿𝑞.
Using Theorem 2.3, the new ﬁbration modelling 𝑞after learning 𝐿is
∫
𝑇.
This deﬁnition is a bit terse and needs some unpacking, so let us piggyback to Exam-
ple 5.1. In our situation, 𝑝knows at least partly what a ‘cat’ (the object 𝐶) is, because the
ﬁbre E 𝑝
𝐶is not empty. We postulate that 𝑝can explain this concept in words, that is, 𝑝can
deﬁne a functor 𝐷𝐶picking a bunch of linguistic elements in the language that mean ‘cat’ to
𝑝since, by Deﬁnition 4.2, the limit ˆ𝐶𝑝of ∇𝑝♯◦𝐷𝐶is a subset of ∇𝑝♯𝐶, which corresponds
exactly to E 𝑝
𝐶via Theorem 2.3.
The teacher 𝑝would like to ‘transmit’ ˆ𝐶𝑝to 𝑞, but this is not possible since, unless we
postulate either of them is from the planet Vulcan, the only way 𝑝and 𝑞have to communicate
is through the language L. Still, 𝑝can utter the explanation and thus share the functor 𝐷𝐶
with 𝑞. Notice how, at this stage, 𝐷𝐶is most likely not an explanation for 𝑞as ∇𝑞♯𝐶= E𝑞
𝐶
is empty by deﬁnition.
In any case, 𝑞can calculate the limit ˆ𝐶𝑞of ∇𝑞♯◦𝐷𝐶. The limits ˆ𝐶𝑞and ˆ𝐶𝑝will, in
general, be diﬀerent, as the same explanation makes sense to diﬀerent speakers in diﬀerent
ways. Notice that whereas ˆ𝐶𝑝is always non empty as 𝐷𝐶is deﬁned to be an explanation for
𝑝, ˆ𝐶𝑞can be empty. This happens when 𝑞is not able to successfully combine the meanings
of the words in the explanation 𝐷𝐶: the explanation does not make sense to 𝑞. Interestingly,
this is the case for the tautological explanation of Remark 4.4, which captures perfectly the
meaning of 𝐶for 𝑝, but means absolutely nothing to 𝑞.

Whenever ˆ𝐶𝑞is not empty, this is nothing more than a combination of concepts that
𝑞already knows, as illustrated in Figure 1. 𝑞includes this composition of concepts in the
ﬁbre over 𝐿, while the morphisms from the limit to its atomic constituents are included as
morphisms between the ﬁbres. In this procedure, the underlying language category for 𝑞
changes, as we now have a ﬁbration over the category F 𝑞, which is obtained by adding new
morphisms to the language category L. This is not a bug but a feature: in learning the
meaning of a new concept, the speaker 𝑞also learns new ways to turn words and sentences
into others.
Remark 5.7. The language game in Example 3.3 is taken up and debated later in [35] with a
question: should we interpret the request ‘Slab!’ as a word or a sentence? In the latter case,
the sentence ‘Slab!’ should be understood as a shortening of the sentence ‘Bring me a slab!’.
Concerning this sentence, we can consider the roles as inverted with respect to Example 3.3:
the builder makes a request, and the assistant can use Deﬁnition 5.6 to build a meaning for
the sentence ‘Bring me a slab!’. Hopefully, this meaning will include things contextually
relevant to the situation, allowing the assistant to identify the slab and fulﬁl the builder’s
request correctly.
Yet, this does not answer Wittgenstein’s question, namely how we manage to go from
‘Slab!’ to ‘Bring me a slab!’. Wittgenstein argues that the reason behind this semantic
identiﬁcation is the fact that these two sentences admit the same contextual use: there is
no need for an explicit explanation, as context is directly responsible of disambiguating this
sentence.
...But what is context mathematically? This is quite a thorny question. One possible
solution to model context in our framework is using stronger models for the language category
L. In many examples, L is taken to be a pregroup, which corresponds to a context-free
grammar in the sense of Chomsky [4]. We could instead make use of models of grammar
that are context-sensitive, allowing for a ﬁner degree of context management. In theory, we
could have grammars where ‘Slab!’ can be reduced to ‘Bring me a slab!’ in a given context,
and proceed as speciﬁed in Remark 5.7.
Yet, if there is something that Deﬁnition 5.6 taught us, it is that the process of acquiring
vocabulary can result in enriching language with semantic meaning. Following the same
idea, we could start with a model of L that is context-free, such as a pregroup, and grad-
ually adding ‘context-sensitive’ morphisms that we borrow from the semantics, exactly as
in Deﬁnition 5.6. Going back to Remark 5.7, the reduction from ‘Slab!’ to ‘Bring me a
slab!’ would be added to L as a result of a language game previously played.
This last consideration hints at the fact that we shall be able to deﬁne disambiguation,
and more in general communication, ﬁbrationally. This is a broad topic, and a current matter
of investigation.

Conclusion and future work
In this work, we used the framework provided by FibLang to take a ﬁrst stab at describing
vocabulary acquisition mathematically. In particular, we deﬁned the concept of explanation
to deﬁne, in turn, vocabulary acquisition by paraphrasis. A clear direction of future work
is to use Deﬁnition 4.2 as the building block for a more general theory of communication:
intuitively, speakers communicate in a game-theoretic fashion, exchanging explanations and
using them to build meanings until they reach some kind of ﬁxed point, at which providing
further explanations does not result in building further meaning. This broader picture would
fully capture Wittgenstein’s ideas regarding language games, and we consider it an ambitious
goal. With respect to this, a conjecture we are currently working on is to show how the
bidirectional, game-theoretic nature of interactions between two speakers naturally suggests
the use of self-dual categorical structures.
On a more practical standpoint, we would like to investigate a possible replacement
of the limit in Deﬁnition 4.2 and in Deﬁnition 5.6 with something more linguistically
sound: it is true that limits are universal constructions in category theory, and, as such, are
mathematically well-behaved. Yet, in strictly applied contexts it may be useful to experiment
with alternative deﬁnitions: for instance, considering a model of meaning where concepts
in the ﬁbres are images may be a sensible choice to experiment with machine-learning
algorithms that merge images together [13].
