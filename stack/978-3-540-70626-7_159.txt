Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)

Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction between
the quarks that constitute the strongly interacting particles, the hadrons, consisting
of baryons and mesons. ( Particle Physics. Quarks, see  Color Charge Degree of
Freedom in Particle Physics; Mixing and Oscillations of Particles; Particle Physics;
Parton Model; QFT). It is modeled on the extremely successful theory of  electrons
and photons, quantum electrodynamics ( QED). However, unlike the latter, which
is tested now to 10th order in the strength of the electric charge of the electron, it is
not easy to compare QCD with experiment. This is not only because the coupling is
strong, not weak as in electrodynamics, but also because of the related fact that the
fundamental components of the theory, the quarks and the force-carrying gluons,
have never been directly seen, and are generally believed to be unattainable because
of the phenomenon of conﬁnement.
Yukawa [1] was the ﬁrst to start to understand the strong force in terms of his
posited “mesotron,” what we now call the pion. He believed that the strong nu-
clear force between protons and neutrons in the nucleus could be understood in
terms of the exchange of a mesotron between these particles, the short range of
the nuclear force reﬂecting the fact that the mass of the mesotron was around
100 MeV c−2. However, by the end of the 1950s dozens of strongly interacting par-
ticles, most rapidly decaying, had been discovered in cosmic rays and accelerators,
and these could not all be fundamental. Physicists searched for various schemes to
unite the zoo of particles, and Gell-Mann [2] and Zweig [3] independently came
up with the quark model, which was ﬁrst not taken very seriously except as a way
to describe the group theory that organized the hadrons. This group was called by
Gell-Mann the eightfold way, but in fact it was simply SU(3), the group of three
by three unitary matrices with determinant one. The fundamental representation of
the group was realized by three quarks, what we now call up, down, and strange.
(Now we know there are six “ﬂavors” of quarks, up, down; charm, strange; and top,
bottom; grouped in three families or generations of two each.) The quarks had frac-
tional charge; up had charge +2/3, down had charge −1/3 in units of the electron
charge, and each carried  spin ℏ/2.
The quark model could be used to classify all the observed strongly interacting
particles: baryons, like the proton and neutron, were composed of three quarks, and
mesons, like the pion, were composed of a quark and an antiquark. No other combi-
nations seemed then, or now, to appear in nature. (The recent ﬂap over pentaquarks
has ended with no believable evidence for exotic states.) However, it supplied no
dynamics, and it left open the question of why quarks were not seen.
The next major step was supplied by Greenberg [4], who noted that to consis-
tently describe baryons in the quark model required a new quantum number, called
color, since three “charges” were required, called, say, red, green, and blue. The

simplest example is the famous  baryon resonance, which comes in four charge
states, −1, 0, 1, 2. The ++ state should be composed of three up quarks, each hav-
ing charge +2/3. The spin of the  was 3/2, precisely what one would expect by
adding the spins of the three up quarks in a symmetrically aligned state. Correspond-
ingly, the spatial wave function should have zero orbital angular momentum, and
should therefore be symmetric as well. But the  wave function of a fermion must
be totally antisymmetric under interchange of the constituent coordinates, so if it is
symmetric in space, and symmetric in spin, it must be antisymmetric in something
else, color. Such a state is one with no net color, the antisymmetrical combination
of red, green, and blue. So the rule became, only those states are allowed which are
color singlets; these are just the mesons and baryons described above.
The mathematics of this is that the color group is also SU(3) (no relation to the
ﬂavor SU(3) group introduced in the eightfold way); the quarks are triplets under
color, and in terms of irreducible representations of SU(3), labeled by their dimen-
sionality, baryons and mesons are described by
3 ⊗3 ⊗3 = 10 ⊕8 ⊕8 ⊕1;
3 ⊗¯3 = 8 ⊕1,
the singlet in each case corresponding to the color part of a hadron wavefunction.
Still there was no dynamics. That came from earlier work in the 1950s, when
Yang and Mills [5] discovered non Abelian gauge theories (quantum electrodynam-
ics is an Abelian gauge theory). The great success of these theories came with the
electroweak synthesis ( Particle Physics), carried out by Schwinger [6], Glashow
[7], Weinberg [8], and Salam [9]. As soon as that approach was seen to be successful
and consistent in 1971 [10], it was natural to apply it to the quark model. However,
how could that theory be consistent with the conﬁnement property that only color
singlet states appear in nature? The answer came with the work of Politzer [11],
Gross, and Wilczek [12], who showed that a non Abelian gauge theory like that
based on SU(3) would have the property of asymptotic freedom:  Color Charge
Degree of Freedom in Particles Physics; QFT. That is, the force becomes strong at
large distance (low energies) but weak at short distance (high energies). This is just
what is needed to explain the quark model, where inside the nucleons (neutrons and
protons) the quarks are nearly free, but they can never get more than about 10−15 m
away from each other. This was also quite consistent with the deep-inelastic experi-
ments which had appeared by 1970 which showed nearly free point-like constituents
within the nucleons [13].
Gell-Mann is usually attributed as author of QCD [14]. The theory is governed
by a Lagrangian density very similar to that of QED,

The difference between QCD and QED is that in the former there are eight colors
of gluon ﬁelds, which are represented by the index a (repeated indices are to be
summed over). The sum over f represents summing over the different ﬂavors of

quarks; each ﬂavor of quark has three components in color space, and the eight
matrices λa live in that space:
λ1 =

The matrices satisfy the group property

where the f abc are the structure constants of the SU(3) group. The non Abelian ﬁeld
strength is constructed in terms of potentials as follows,

Note that the theory states that, unlike photons ( light quantum), gluons carry
color, and hence couple to each other.
As in QED, Feynman rules can be readily written down to describe how to carry
out perturbative calculations in powers of the coupling constant g. (A readable dis-
cussion is in [17]). These are, however, somewhat more complex than those in QED,
and by themselves, of somewhat limited utility. Perturbation theory does not capture
the conﬁnement property, and in any case we do not want to calculate scattering
amplitudes for free quarks, but for observable particles, the hadrons. To do this,
semiempirical models are used to construct form factors and structure functions, so
there are rather few direct tests of QCD itself. The structure functions encode our
ignorance about the real wavefunction of hadrons. Moreover, because g is rather
large, g2/4πℏc ranging from 0.1 to 2 depending on the process (remember that the
strength of the coupling decreases as the energy of the process increases), higher
corrections may in fact turn out to be larger that the leading terms, so perturbation
theory is intrinsically unreliable. There are various methods to reduce this unreliabil-
ity (for example, what is called analytic perturbation theory [15]), and lattice gauge
theory [16] is a viable approach to transcend perturbation theory, but it may be fair
to say that QCD, although nearly universally believed true, is not yet a quantitative
model of strong interactions.
