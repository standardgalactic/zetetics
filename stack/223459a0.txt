Interstellar grains may be a mixture of graphite particles formed 
in carbon stars and of silicates in oxygen-rich giants. 
The astro-
physical consequences of such a grain mixture are examined. 
THE problem of the formation and composition of inter-
stellar grains has assumed a rapidly increasing importance 
in recent years, beeause of the likely connexion between 
grains and the infrared emission from stars, nebulae and 
galaxies. The failure to detect the expected 3·1 micron 
infrared band of solid H 20 (ref. I), together with the 
difficulty of maintaining ice near stars and the difficulty 
of condensing ice, has pointed more and more towards 
grains composed of a refractory material, or at any rate 
to grains with a refractory core. Graphite has been widely 
discussed as the most likely material of this kind, partly 
because carbon is an abundant element and partly 
because the optical constants of graphite are favourable 
for explaining features of the extinction curve of starlight. 
Support has recently been given to another interesting 
possibility for the refractory material of grains 2- 6 and we 
begin by discussing these arguments. 
The proposed refractory material consists of silicates, 
MgSi0 3 , (Mg, Fe) Si0 3 • A broad emission feature occur-
ring in the range 8-12 microns in the stars 0 Ceti, fL Cephei, 
IX Orionis and )( Cygni is similar to an infrared band of 
these silicate materials. On tho other hand, the carbon 
star R Leporis does not show this band, but shows an 
infrared excess in the ~waveband 8-14 microns which has 
been attributed to thermal emission by grains. 
The 
situation then is that in the case where graphite is most 
likely to be formed there is no emission feat.ure which 
characterizes graphite and that for M stars, in which it 
is more difficult to form graphite, an emission feature 
similar to that of silicate materials is actually found. 
We think this argument may well be correct, but it is 
worth noticing that laboratory data for graphite weaken 
certain aspects of it. Thus Taft and Phillipp (ref. 7 and

pure graphite is not active in the 8-12 micron region, 
whereas Foster and Howarth8 find that activity in this 
region occurs when the graphite contains hydrogen of the 
order of 1 per cent. 
One could argue, then, that in R 
Leporis, the carbon star, graphitc is essentially pure, 
whereas in the less favoured stars it is not. In fact, the 
data of Foster and Howarth for the 8-10 micron range 
are strikingly similar to the astronomical observations.

Unfortunately, Foster and Howarth do not give data

Fig. 3. Normalized emissivity of soot with 98'5 per cent graphite 
content calculated from the data of Foster and Howarth'. 
This curve is to be compared with the upper most dashed 
~lUrve of Fig. 4 (reproduced from ref. 2). The agreement 
IS at least as good as that for silicate materials. 
The argument for silicate materials would therefore 
seem to us to be reduced to a consideration of the oxygen-
carbon ratio for the stars in question. Undoubtedly in 
condItIOns of appreCIable oxygen cxcess graphite will 
not be formed. 
Two of the stars mentioned, c£ Orionis 
and 0 Oeti, have, ~owever, already been considered by 
o~e of us9 as stars m WhICh a small quantity of graphite 
mIght form. 
The oxygcn excess in these stars appears 
to be only slight. Gilman3 considers that silicon carbide 
will be formed in such cases rather than graphite. Our 
calculations on this point are incomplete because of 
uncertainties in thermochemical data for silicon carbide. 
Whatever the course of thc argument in particular 
cases, there can be no doubt that refractory grains con· 
densing in cooling gas will be mainly graphite if % 
is 
appreCIably greater than unity and will be chiefly com-
po~ed of MgO, SiO. and Fe if % 
is appreciably less than 
umty. 
We arrived at this conclusion earlier'o. 
The 
latter case must certainly occur, and so we agrec with 
the. workers of the Minnesota and Oalifornia groups that 
grams composed of silicate materials exist. In our cal-
c~lations we found MgO condensed first, then Fe, then 
SIO., and we thought in terms of composite grains with 
an MgO core surrounded by Fe and SiO. mantles. Thc 
condensation temperatures for MgO and SiO. differed 
by only about 200
0 0, however, which is almost close 
enough for the small binding of SiO. to MgO in MgSi0 3 
crystal to playa part. Uncertainties in the thcrmochemi-
c~l .data could also be significant when small temperature 
dIfferences are mvolved. Hence we consider it possiblc 
that MgSiOs might condense directly, giving a mineral 
grain rather than an MgO core and SiO. mantle. Even 
if the mineral form does not condense directly a composite 
grain condensing at minimum phase in the atmosphere 
of a star of variable luminosity could become fused at 
maximum phase, again leading to mineral formation. 
Fe would tend to bc evaporated in such a reheating 
process. 
. Granted ~hat both mineral and graphite grains are 
lIkely t~ eXIst, th~ next question is, in what proportion? 
Pure mmeral grams have low conductivity and would 
not by themselves give a satisfactory stellar extinction 
curve. On the other hand, impurities, in particular Fe, 
could provide appreciable conductivity. There could be 
situations in which the conductivity was similar to that 
of graphite, making the general features of the extinction 
curve similar to graphite. It seems more interesting, 
however, to consider a mixture of graphite with mineral 
grains of low conductivity. 
Extinction calculations were first carried out for 
MgSiOs particles (refractive index m = 1·66) of various 
radii. No single size of such dielectric particle seems able 
NATURE. VOL. 223. AUGUST 2. 1969 
to match the intcrstellar extinction curve in thc optical 
and ultraviolet spectral regions. 
We next considered a mixturc of MgSiOa grains of radii 
1'sil with graphitc particles of radii rgr. Thc proportions 
of the two types of grains were described by a parameter 
x defined so that x times as much extinction at ).. = 4500 A 
arose from the graphite as from the silicate. It was found 
that for rgr in the range 0·055-0·07 microns and rsil in 
the range 0'06-0·09 microns very good agreement with the 
extinction curve occurs for x"'- 6. The best dctailed fits 
emerged for the combination Of' radii rgr= 0·065 microns, 
rsil = 0·07 microns. 
The extinction curves for this case 
normalized to ~m = 0 at ).. -, = 1· 22 microns-l, ~m = 1 at 
)..-'=2·22 microns-' are plotted in Fig. 5. 
The several 
curves are for the cases x = 4, 5, 6 and 8; the points are 
the observations of Nandyll in the optical region and of 
Stecher" in the rocket ultraviolet. (Although our results 
are for combinations of single sizes of graphite and MgSiOa, 
It IS likely that similar results hold for size-distribut.ions 
wit.h appropriately chosen values of the mean radii.) 
. The present fit is seen to include a hump in the ext.inc-
tIOn curve at ).. -, = 4·4 microns-' corresponding t.o au 
ultraviolet absorption feature in graphite. 
Although a 
second hump occurs at )..-' = 6 microns-' its position is 
dependent on the radius of the silicate particle and is 
expected to be somewhat smeared out by a size distribu-
tion. The best agreement in Fig. 5 is for the case X= 6-
t.hat is, with six times more extinction at. 4500 A arising 
from the graphite component of the mixt.ure. 
Because 
graphit.e particles of radii 0·065 microns have an extinction 
cross-section ~ 10 times t.hat of silicate particles of radii 
0·07 microns, it would appcar that comparable Illass 
densities of graphite and silicates may well exist in the 
int.erstellar medium. 
B~sides giving a good fit to the extinction curve, such 
a mIxture has several other advantages. Being wholly 
composed of refractory mat.erials it can persist near st.ars, 
whereas grains with ice mantles or mantles of solid H. 
cannot. In fact it behaves very much like graphite grains 
surrounded by ice mantles-the silicates taking the place 
of the ice mantles-and such grains have been shown by 
Van de Hulst and de J ong'S to satisfy the albedo and 
phase function requirements of the diffuse galactic light. 
Iron impurities in the silicates could produce an 
efficient magnetic alignment'· of the silicate grains. If 
these are of cylindrical shape they not only lead to a 
polarization of starlight but, as Greenberg has pointed 
out, they give a good fit to the mean wavelength depend-
ence of the polarization14 ,15. In this connexion it may be 
noted that, according to Purcell", graphite grains are 
difficult to align magnetically.

F"ig. 5. Comparison of the wavelength dependence of interstellar extinction predicted for a graphite-silicate mixture with observations. 
Points without bars are the optical observations of NandyH; points with error bars are the rocket ultraviolet observations of Stecher". The 
theoretical curves are for the case of graphite particles of radii rgr = 0'065 microns combined with silicate particles of radii rsil = 0'07 microns. 
The parameter x (characterizing the several curves) is the weighting factor defined so that x times as much extinction at 4500 A arises from the 
graphite as from the silicate. 
All quantities are normalized to Llm=O at }._t = 1·22 microns-to Llm=l at }.-t=2·22 microns-to 
""ith radii rgr ~ 0·1 micron, can be possibly aligned, how-
CVE'r, by a non.magnetic process17• 
Graphite particles of 
thE'sC dimensions can also provide agreement with the 
mean wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization. 
\\Te come now to the important point that grains of low 
conductivity have an unexpectedly large emissivity in 
t,he far infrared, With 
m 2 = x - 2i<r)./c

equation (1) gives 
(4) 
For fixed wavelength A the right-hand side of equation (4) 
has a maximum with respect to the conductivity cr when 
2crA/C=2+x 
(5) 
For x=2, A=O·1 cm, equation (5) gives cr=6x 1011 S-l 
Inserting equation (5) in equation (4) gives 
12rra 
(Qabs)max= (2+x)/, 
(6) 
This shows that provided cr is appropriately chosen the 
absorption coefficient falls rather slowly as A increases. 
Low conductivity grains can still retain a considcrable 
absorptive efficiency (and hence a considerable emissive 
efficiency) even at wavelengths of ~ 0·1 cm. Thus insert-
ing x=2, A = 0·1 cm in equation (6) gives (Qabs)m~x = 
30rra :;::, 102a. For grains with radius a approaching 1 micron 
this iR ~ 10-2, a remarkably high value for so long a wave-
length. 
Low conductivity grains have tho important property 
of remaining cool in the presence of starlight. For a par-
ticular grain define Ag by 
2crAg/C= 2+x 
(7) 
Ag being long compared with optical wavelengths. For 
the moment let cr be independent of A. Then for A~Ag we 
have 
487tacr 
1 
Qabs;; --0-
. (2+X)2 
(8) 
so that Q'bs is independent of A. 
Next let the starlight 
have an energy density equal to that of a thermodynamic 
radiation field of temperature Terr. Let Ael! be the wave-
length at the maximum of the Planck curve for tempera-
ture Terl. Then provided Aeft < Ag the grain takes up a 
temperature not significantly higher than T ett. 
For 
starlight in the galaxy this is about 3 K. The reason for 
this property is that Q.bs is effectively independent of 
wavelength over the whole range from Aerr down to optical 
wavelengths. For Tefl = 3 K, Aerr~ 0·2 cm. The condition 
on the conduct.ivity is cr < ~ 3 x lO" S-l. 
It is possible therefore that low conductivity grains 
without graphite are not significantly affected by starlight, 
and hence take up a temperature of ~ 2'7 K determined 
by the microwave background. It is on such grains that 
solid hydrogen is likely to form 1". 
The conductivity of 
solid hydrogen is also likely to be low, so that the same 
considerations continue to apply to a grain consisting of 
a low conductivity refractory core surrounded by an 
extensive mantle of solid hydrogen. It is a matter of 
considerable urgency to determine cr for solid hydrogen 
because mantles of solid hydrogen may well have quite 
large radii. For such grains Qabs could be as high as 10-' 
in the far infrared. 
Low conductivity grains scatter starlight but they 
hardly absorb it alL On the other hand, graphite grains 
have conductivity ~ 1015 8-1 , which makes them extremely 
effective in absorbing starlight. The high conductivity 
of graphite makes such grains less effective in the far infra-
red, however. Thus pure graphite grains must take up a 
temperature significantly higher than low conductivity 
grains, which makes them less suitable as nuclei for the 
condensation of solid hydrogen.

It is interesting that a mixture of graphite and low 
conductivity grains can serve as an effective thermalizer 
of starlight. The graphite is responsible for absorbing the 
starlight and for re-radiating far enough into the infrared 
for the low conductivity grains to take over the situation. 
The low conductivity grains redistribute the infrared 
emission of the graphite. In our view it is probable that 
the energy released by H->-He conversion in the early 
history of the galaxies was thermalized by such a grain 
mixture. 
This explains the origin of the microwave 
background radiation and it removes the coincidcnce 
which otherwise exists between the energy density given 
by H->-He conversion and the energy density of the 
microwave background. 
The possibility of relating an issue of such great cosmo-
logical importance to the properties of grains emphasizes 
the importance of conducting experiments in the labora-
tory in order to remove uncertainties in our knowledge 
of their physical properties. Conductivity measurements 
are an obvious example, in particular conductivity meas-
urements on solid hydrogen including conditions of 
radiation damage (from cosmic rays in the astrophysical 
situation). The relevant range of cr, as far as the micro-
wave background is concerned, is from 10'0 to 10'3 8-' •

Airborne radiometriC measurements in the water vapour rotational 
band over extended flight paths indicate frequent variations of 
stratospheric water vapour apparently associated with tropo-
spheriC meteorological features.

THE distribution of water vapour in the stratosphere 
plays an essential part in the analysis of the illfrared 
radiation budget of the atmosphere and in the determina-
tion of the thermal structure of the atmosphere from 
satellite radiometric measurements. 
Hitherto, however, 
it has been almost impossible to obtain real time profiles of 
the stratospheric water vapour chiefly becanse of the 
difficnlty of coordinating balloon hygrometer ascents l .' and 
the small number of local aircraft measurements 3 • 
By 
following satellite experimenters, we have now determined 
water vapour profiles in the stratosphere over long aircraft 
traverses from infrared radiometric observations in 
cloudless conditions by an inverse solution of the radiative 
transfer equation'. 
The method has previously been 
applied to balloon borne radiometer measurements' and 
to balloon radiometersonde measurements. 
Instead of looking down into the Earth's atmosphere, 
we look upwards with a broad band radiometer at the 
constant cold sky backgr'ound through a KRS-5 ceiling 
port of a high-flying long-range jet aircraft. Instead of 
scanning spectrally to observe radiant emittances thr'ongh 
varions atmospheric depths, we obseI've at three different 
:wnith angles to vary the observed water vapour optical 
mass over the spectral band 17·0 [Lm to 31·0 [LIll. 
Onr 
objective was to develop a technique for the determination 
of real/time profiles of water vapour in a cloudless strato-
sphere as we]) as of spatial variations in them. 
The infrared radiation detector is a hyper. immersed 
thermistor' bolometer radiometer. 
Optical filtering pro-
vides a cut-on frequency of 17·09 [Lm (585 cm-I ). 
The 
transmissivity of the filter system is reduced from 42 per 
cent at cut-on fr'equency to 10 per cent at 31·75 [Lm 
(315 cm- l ), which eliminates the strong CO 2 absorption 
band at 15·0 [Lm (667 cm-I ) and puts the spectrall'ange of 
the system in the rotational water vapour band. 
The noise equivalent irradianee rating of the basic 
radiometer was improved by eliminating the cavity 
heater circuit and allowing the large aluminium window 
port to act as a stable heat sink at approximately - 20° C, 
thus reducing the detector cavity operating temperature 
from 55° C to approximately - 20° C. 
The solid angle 
aperture of the instrument was also increased from 2°
