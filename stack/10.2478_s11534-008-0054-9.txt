Abstract:
An expression for the chain length probability distribution p(l) of a one dimensional Ising chain was
derived using the cluster variation method formalism, the p(l) being expressed through the pair cluster
probabilities. It was shown numerically that the same expression also applies in the case of one dimen-
sional chains formed along one of the next-nearest neighbor interactions included in the two dimensional
ASYNNNI (Asymmetric Next-Nearest Neighbor Ising) model, widely used to describe the statistics of
oxygen ordering in the basal CuOx planes of the YBa2Cu3O6+x type high-Tc superconducting materials.
Equivalency between ASYNNNI and 1d Ising model is discussed.

Introduction
It is well known that the oxygen concentration, x, plays
a signiﬁcant role in determining the superconducting
and structural properties of the high Tc superconduc-
tor, YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO). Soon after the discovery of
YBa2Cu3O6+x it was established that when the oxygen
content exceeds x = 0.35, the oxygen atoms in the basal
CuOx planes (also referred as the chain plane) tend to
arrange into Cu-O chains of diﬀerent lengths [1] aligned
along one of the crystallographic axes, usually taken to
be the b axis. This chain formation initiates a structural
phase transition from a disordered tetragonal state to an

orthorhombic structural phase. The existence of ﬁve diﬀer-
ent orthorhombic phases has been established experimen-
tally. The ﬁve orthorhombic phases are characterized by
both diﬀerences in the way that sequences of Cu-O chains
are arranged along the a axis, and diﬀerences in the unit
cell periods [2]. The fact that only orthorhombic samples
are superconducting, led to the conclusion that the forma-
tion of Cu-O chains is crucial for the hole doping of the
superconducting CuO2 planes which causes the supercon-
ducting behavior in YBCO [3, 4]. Since the YBCO material
becomes superconducting only after a certain oxygen sto-
ichiometry is achieved, it was assumed that this coincides
with oxygen chains reaching some critical length lcr. The
theory of critical chain length and the microscopic prop-
erties of the chain fragments were investigated in several
theoretical studies [5–9]. The general conclusion of these
studies was that only chains longer than a critical length,

whose value was argued [8, 10] to be 3 or 4, can transfer
charge out of the basal planes, thus providing the increase
in the number of the mobile charge carriers in the CuO2
sheets which leads to the appearance of superconductivity
[11].
One of the ﬁrst theoretical models proposed for the study
of oxygen ordering in the basal planes of YBCO was
the twodimensional Ising model with asymmetric interac-
tions of next nearest neighbors (ASYNNNI model). The
ASYNNNI model was originally developed by de Fontaine
et al. [12] and, at the time, adequately described all the
main features of the structural phase diagram and cor-
rectly predicted the order of the phase transitions. How-
ever, the model failed to stabilize other than the Ortho
I and Ortho II (Fig.
1) orthorhombic structural phases.
Though attempts have been made to extend the model in
order to include other experimentally observed structures
[13–16], the plain ASYNNNI model has remained the most
widely used model for the investigation of the thermody-
namics of oxygen ordering in the CuOx planes.
Recently, the plain ASYNNNI model has been employed
in extensive studies of the properties of the distribution of
the CuO chains with respect to chain length [17, 18]. It was
found that the chain length probability distribution satis-
ﬁes the simple geometrical law [17] i.e. that the distribu-
tion is determined by only one parameter. This parameter
is the average chain length, lav, for a given oxygen sub-
lattice and is experimentally measurable. This result was
derived, in the case of low temperatures, by studying the
structure of low energy levels and was conﬁrmed in Monte
Carlo numerical simulations for Ortho I and II structural
phases. The result was conﬁrmed for the Ortho II struc-
tural phase at a temperature of T ≈450 K, where T is
the oxygen equilibrium temperature [18], and in the case of
the Ortho I phase for temperatures as high as T ≈1800
K [17]. Furthermore, it was concluded that this speciﬁc
form of the chain probability distribution should be valid
for all oxygen concentrations, and all temperatures where
the orthorhombic structures are stable, except in the close
vicinity of the line of the critical points [18]. Since the
same geometric chain length probability distribution also
applies in the case of the inﬁnite one dimensional Ising
model [19, 20], the conclusion was made that the result
obtained is another manifestation of the previously estab-
lished low temperature equivalence between ASYNNNI
and 1d Ising model, in which the role of the Ising chain
NN coupling J is played by the NNN interaction V2 of
the ASYNNNI model [21].
In this work we will use the cluster variation method
(CVM) formalism, to show that the chain length probabil-
ity distribution p(l) of the 1d Ising model can be expressed
through the pair cluster probabilities xi (i denotes one of

the possible cluster microstates), and that the expression
obtained is equivalent to the one found in Ref. [17]. for
the chain length probability distribution of Cu-O chains
formed in the basal planes of YBCO material, studied in
the frame of the ASYNNNI model.
We will also show
that in the case of the ASYNNNI model, the same chain
length probability distribution applies along both of the
next-nearest neighbor interactions present in the model.

Chain length probability distribu-
tion
The cluster variation method is an approximate numer-
ical method originally proposed by Kikuchi [22] for the
calculation of phase diagrams of alloys. It has been refor-
mulated several times which has enabled both its wider

application [23–28], and contributed to an improved under-
standing of the method itself. Though the method yields
mean ﬁeld critical exponents, it is able to predict the val-
ues of the critical transition temperatures very accurately.
While the 1d Ising model can be treated exactly within
the CVM formalism, in the 2D and 3D cases this method
gives approximate results with an accuracy that is depen-
dant on the size of the basic cluster. It has been shown
that the approximate results obtained by the CVM method
tend to the exact results as the size of the basic cluster
increases [29].
Figure 2. Chain fragment of length l contained in the 1d Ising
chain, and the microstates of the pair cluster with cor-
responding probabilities and state degeneracies.
In the simple case of the ordinary 1d Ising model, which
can be represented by an inﬁnite Ising chain consisting of
spins coupled by the nearest neighbor exchange interac-
tions, it is suﬃcient to choose a pair of spins as a basic
cluster for the CVM implementation. Possible microstates
of the pair cluster and the corresponding probabilities and
state degeneracies are shown at Fig. 2. We shall consider
the full chain fragment of length l, within the inﬁnite Ising
chain, to consist of the sequence of l “up” spins,σi = +1,
(analogous to the l sites occupied by an oxygen atom in
the case of the CuOx lattice), with end sites having “down”
spins, σi = −1, (analogous to unoccupied sites of the lat-
tice) as neighbours.
The probability distribution of the
full chain fragment can be constructed using the itera-
tive procedure presented in the work of Vinograd et al.
[30, 31]. This procedure allows the probabilities of chain
fragments of any length to be calculated as a function
of pair and point cluster microstate probabilities. Appling
this procedure, and employing the fact that the point clus-
ter probabilities can be expressed through the pair cluster
probabilities, the probability of a full chain fragment hav-
ing length l (0 < l) can be written as a function of the
pair cluster probabilities x1 and x2:
p(l) = x2
x1
x1 + x2
x1
x1 + x2
· · ·

x1 + x2
x2
x1 + x2

.
(1)
Since we want these probabilities to fall between zero
and 1 we normalize them according to the following nor-
malizing condition:
X
l
p(l) = 1.
(2)
Thus, we ﬁnally obtain true chain length probabilities:
p(l) =
x2
x1 + x2

x1
x1 + x2
l−1
.
(3)
These normalized probabilities represent the fraction of
the chains having length l:
p(l) =
n(l)
P
k
n(k),
(4)
where n(l) is the number of chain fragments of length, l,
and P
k n(k) is the total number of chain fragments in the
system. Let us denote c, the concentration of up (+1) spins
(or oxygen atoms in the case of the basal plane lattice of
YBCO material) in the chain, and let n be the fraction of
oxygen atoms situated at the end of the full chain frag-
ment. These two variables can be expressed through the
pair cluster conﬁguration probabilities as follows:
c = x1 + x2,
n = 2x2.
(5)
Since every full chain fragment has two atoms residing at
the chain ends, the total number of chain fragments will
be proportional to half the number of the chain ends. Thus
the following expression for the average chain length can
be written:
lav = 2c
n = x1 + x2
x2
.
(6)
After few manipulations the chain probability p(l) can be
expressed, as a function of c and T, through a single pa-
rameter, the average chain length lav(c, T):
p(l) = (1 −lav)l−1

which is exactly the expression for the chain probability
distribution which was shown in Ref. [17] to be valid for
the ASYNNNI model at low temperatures.

numerical simulations while the open triangles represent results found using the CVM method and expression (3).
where El,i is the energy of the cluster l in its i-th cluster
microstate, and Zl is its partition function, the chain length
probability can be cast in the following form:
p(l) = r(1 −r)l−1,
(9)
where r = (1+eβ(E2−E1))−1, β = kBT. In the case of the 1d
Ising model with ferromagnetic coupling J, we have E2 −
E1 = 2J with expression (9) being equal to the probability
distribution of the number of spins in the “up” domain in
an inﬁnite Ising chain as reported in Ref. [19].

Numerical simulations and dis-
cussion
In the previous section the chain length probability dis-
tribution of the 1d Ising chain was expressed through the
pair cluster probabilities xi
(i = 1, 2), the values of which
determine the microstate of the complete Ising chain. We
have shown that expression (3) is equivalent to that used
in the ASYNNNI model for the probabilities, p(l), of the
Cu-O chains formed along V2 bonds. The equivalency of
the two expressions is considered to be a consequence of
the previously established isomorphism between this and
the 1d Ising model. However, the pair cluster probabili-
ties, which are to be used in expression (3) to calculate
the chain fragment probabilities of the ASYNNNI model
formed along V2 bonds, are not the same as those ob-
tained from the simple pair approximation of the CVM
method when applied to the 1d Ising chain coupled by V2
interaction. Instead, when expression (3) is applied to the
ASYNNNI model, the probabilities x1 and x2 are taken as
the equilibrium cluster probabilities within some higher
order CVM approximation appropriate for the ASYNNNI
model investigation. This higher order approximation will
certainly include basic clusters much larger than the pair
clusters suﬃcient to treat the 1d Ising model. As a re-
sult, the pair cluster probabilities will include information
on the inﬂuence that the surrounding spins have on the
interaction of two spins incorporated in the chain. Thus,
in terms of the chain length probabilities, the ASYNNNI
model can be considered, equivalent to the 1d Ising model
in which spins are coupled by some eﬀective pair interac-
tion which incorporates the eﬀect of the surrounding sites
on the interaction energy of the spin pair considered, as
well as the bare pair spin interaction of the ASYNNNI
model. This equivalency can be assumed to exist along
each of the two next-nearest neighbour pair interactions
included in the ASYNNNI model, but it is more evident
along the attractive V2 interaction which induces the for-
mation of long chain fragments.
It is also important to note that, from expression (6) and the
deﬁnition of the variable r, we can derive the relationship,

lav = 1/r. Since the variable r is, in the case of the 1d
Ising chain with ferromagnetic interaction J > 0, bounded
from above by 1/2, it follows that the ASYNNNI model can
be considered equivalent to the ferromagnetically coupled
Ising model only when the condition lav > 2 is met.
To prove the validity of expression (3) for the ASYNNNI
model, the chain length probability distribution, p(l), was
calculated by using the cluster variation method (4,5-
points cluster approximation) and expression (3), and then
compared with the value of p(l) calculated directly in
Monte Carlo simulations of the ASSYNNI model (apply-
ing the standard Metropolis algorithm). The Hamiltonian
of the ASYNNNI model can be expressed by the following
equation:
H = −µ
X
i
σi + V1
X
NN
σiσj + V2
X
NNN′
σiσj + V3
X
NNN
σiσj,
(10)
where σ i is the Ising spin, which can take the value +1 or
−1 depending on the site, i occupancies, µ is the chem-
ical potential representing external ﬁeld, and V1, V2 and
V3 are the model interactions (see Fig. 1): V1 and V3 are
repulsive, while V2 is attractive. The ﬁrst sum goes over
all sites and second one is taken over all nearest neigh-
bours.
The third summation is performed over all next
nearest neighbour sites along V2 bond, while the last one
is calculated over next nearest neighbours coupled via V3
interaction. The values of the interaction parameters used
were those obtained by Sterne and Wille from the ﬁrst
principle calculations using the linear-muﬃn-tin orbital
method: V1= 6.9 mRy ,V2= -2.4 mRy and V3= 1.1 mRy
[33]. In order to determine the probabilities, p(l), the num-
ber of chains of length l, and total number of chains were
calculated for every lattice microstate generated in every
accepted Monte Carlo step of the simulation; the maximal
chain length was determined by the size of the system.
The results of the numerical simulations are presented
in Fig. 3. The ﬁgure shows the probability distribution
of chains extending along V3 interactions as a function
of chain length l calculated at the reduced temperature
τ = kBT/V1 = 0.45 (T ≈450 K). Results are shown
for two diﬀerent oxygen concentrations c (x = 2c) in the
range of the Ortho I structural phase of the YBa2Cu3O6+x
material. Though some discrepancies are present for the
shortest chains, it can be seen that the results obtained
from Monte Carlo simulations performed on a system of
200 x 200 spins are in excellent agreement with those ob-
tained using the 4,5-points cluster approximation of the
CVM method employing the expression (3). Monte Carlo
numerical simulations were also performed at higher tem-
peratures, up to 2000 K in the range of the Ortho I struc-
tural phase (Fig. 4a); once again the results showed excel-
lent agreement with those obtained by the CVM method.
Furthermore, relation (3) was also found to be valid in
the disordered tetragonal phase, though in this structural

Conclusion
In this study the chain length probabilities of the 1d Ising
model were expressed through the pair cluster probabil-
ities. The same expression was used to calculate chain
length probabilities in the frame of the 2d ASYNNNI
model, and the results are compared to those obtained by
numerical Monte Carlo simulations. It was argued that
the ASYNNNI model can be considered equivalent to a
1d Ising model in which the coupling is modeled as a pair
cluster interaction with a spin pair interaction energy that
includes a contribution from both the interaction between
nearest neighbour spins, and the interaction of surround-
ing spins with the spin pair. In general, the equivalency
of the two models can be assumed to exist along any of
the next-nearest neighbor pair interactions included in the
ASYNNNI model, however, when the ASYNNNI model is
applied to the problem of oxygen ordering in the basal
planes of YBa2Cu3O6+x material, it is most evident along
the direction of Cu-O chain formation, i.e. along the V2
coupling.
