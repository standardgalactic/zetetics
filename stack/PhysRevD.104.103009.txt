The axion objects such as axion miniclusters and axion clouds around spinning black holes induce
parametric resonances of electromagnetic waves through the axion-photon interaction. In particular, it has
been known that the resonances from the axion with the mass around 10−6 eV may explain the observed
fast radio bursts (FRBs). Here we argue that similar bursts of high frequency gravitational waves, which we
call fast gravitational wave bursts (FGBs), are generated from axion clumps with the presence of
gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) coupling. The typical frequency is half of the axion mass, which in
general can range from kHz to GHz. We also discuss the secondary gravitational wave production
associated with FRB, as well as the possible host objects of the axion clouds, such as primordial black holes
with typical masses around 10−5 M⊙. Future detections of FGBs together with the observed FRBs are
expected to provide more evidence for the axion.

I. INTRODUCTION
The first observation of the gravitational waves has
started a new era for astrophysics, cosmology and even
particle physics. Searching for gravitational wave signals in
the universe at different frequencies from different sources
has started, from the primordial gravitational waves at
10−16 Hz to the pulsars and binary system signals up to
104 Hz. What is more, the higher frequency up to MHz or
GHz gravitational wave searches have also been proposed
[1,2], and those signals can be generated by the axion
annihilation around the black holes [3–6]. The axion is a
well-motivated dark matter candidate [7–9], though the
distribution of such dark matter around the universe
remains an unknown and interesting topic. Considering
that in early universe evolution the density variations of
both matter and dark matter occurred and acted as the seeds
for cosmic structures today, there are great reasons to
believe that axion distributes in cosmic space unevenly.
The axion was proposed as the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone
boson from the spontaneous breaking of a U(1) global
symmetry, the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry, to solve the
strong CP problem in QCD [10,11]. It was later realized that
there can be more axionlike pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone
bosons related to various global symmetry in UV theories
[12,13]. If this spontaneous breaking of global symmetry
happened before or during inflation, then the axion field
value can be considered homogenous across the observed
Universe, except for small isocurvature and density pertur-
bations. In this case, the axion density variation is not
generically large. If the symmetry was broken after inflation,
then the axion field can only be correlated across the local
horizon size. Later when the temperature dropped to the
order of the axion mass T ∼ma, the axion began to oscillate
at the bottom of the potential, which is acquired by non-
perturbative effects such as instanton. At the same time
axion topological defects decay. The oscillation is not
coherent across the horizon. Notice that during the universe
evolution history, the axion mass also depends on the
temperature of the universe. These different horizon patches
of the axion may have large density variations.
Some of the initial axion density variations grow under
gravity, eventually collapse into denser objects and go

through Bose-Einstein condensation [14–24] or even form
blackholes[25,26].Anothertypeof axionobjectis theaxion
clouds around the spinning black hole. It is produced from
the black hole superradiance or simply gravitational accre-
tion, which can induce black hole instability [25]. The
typical size and radius of the dense axion object depend on
the mass of the axion, the decay constant Λa, assumptions on
the initial density fluctuations and the thermal dependence
of the axion mass. The masses of such dense objects range
from 10−18 M⊙∼102 M⊙[15–20]. The formation and
evolution of such objects include some highly nonlinear
process and can be studied by numerical calculation.
Furthermore, if the axion self-interaction is included or
the density is very large, such axion dense objects can go
through Bose-Einstein condensation and become even
denser. Depending on the model, the average size can be
approximated in some case around 102 km for QCD axion,
and could be possible candidates for the observed fast
radio bursts (FRBs) [15–20,27]. Moreover, there are various
kinds of multimessenger signals of the axionlike dark matter
[28–32], and the recent supermassive black hole image from
the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) can be used to probe the
existence of ultralight bosonic particles that accumulate
through the black hole superradiance effect [33,34].
Here in this paper, we study a scenario that high energy
bursts or periodic bursts of gravitational waves can be
generated around the axion objects, including axion mini-
clusters and axion clouds around the black holes, with the
gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) couplings between axion-
like particle and gravitons [35,36]. It is well studied that
the electromagnetic radio bursts can be produced through
similar processes, from the axion-photon couplings. We do
a similar analysis with the gravitational CS coupling and
the gravitational wave production from the drastic axion/
photon energy oscillation and discuss their properties on
the frequencies, strains, duration, and the energy released.
Such bursts have distinct signatures and interesting con-
sequences and we can look for them with proposed
different types of gravitational wave detectors [1,2].
This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we discuss
the cases with the axion clouds around the primordial
black holes. In Sec. III, we turn on both axionphoton and
gravitational CS couplings and discuss dierent sources and
gravitational strains produced. We end with discussions and
comments in Sec. IV. In the Appendix Awe review the FRB
discussion for axion-photon couplings. In Appendix B we
calculate the gravitational waves induced by gravitational
CS couplings on a at background and discuss various
features of such gravitational waves.
II. AXION CLOUDS AND PRIMORDIAL
BLACK HOLES
In this section, we show that for the axion with mass μeV
(QCD axion) surrounding the black holes, the mass regime
of the black holes that the axion clouds can form is between
10−7 M⊙and 10−3 M⊙, supporting the parameters used in
the previous sections. Rather than the stellar mass black
holes, the masses of primordial black holes mostly fall into
this mass region. See, e.g., [37,38] for the formation of
primordial black holes and recent constraints.

In Fig. 1, we plot the allowed mass range that the axion
clouds can form for primordial black holes. In the shaded
area, the upper bound is given by τa↑< τU, and the lower
bound is given by τa↓< τU, with the expressions (2) (3) (4).
Thus, for the clouds of axions with masses around μeV, the
typical masses of host primordial black holes are around
10−5 M⊙, which in agreement with the early estimation in
[39]. More intriguingly, it matches with the mass estimation
of the novel object “Planet 9” with a mass 5 −10M⊕in the
outer Solar System [40,41], which is just around the order
of 10−5 M⊙.

III. AMPLIFIED ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES
AND GRAVITATIONAL WAVES
In this section, we would like to discuss both the
electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves as well
as the interference effects coming from axion clumps.
Especially, we consider the branching factor of the axion
energy bursts into both waves and the gravitational waves
created by the photon bursts. The total action of CS
modified gravity with axion photon coupling is given by

Again, we assume that the axion field a is only time-
dependent. Except for the axion resonance, there are two
other possible sources for the gravitational waves, although
they are expected to be much smaller than the resonance.
Those two sources are the stress energy tensors of the
Maxwell field and axion field. The equation of the motion
becomes:

It requires involved numerical studies to solve the coupled

IV. ESTIMATION OF THE BRANCHING RATIOS
In the following, we estimate the strength of both signals.
One key property we would like to mention is the branching
ratios from axion to both photons and gravitons, assuming
both couplings turned on. Considering both photon and
graviton are massless and have only two degrees offreedom,
we have at the tree level at the zero temperature,
Brða →ggÞ
Brða →γγÞ ≃α2g
α2γ
:
ð12Þ
Considering that the gravitational CS coupling αg is much
less constrained than the photon-axion coupling αγ, we can
expect that the energy of bursts can go to the gravitational
sector dominantly. For example, if we take the typical values
in αγ ≃10−2=fa ∼10−14 GeV−1. and κ4αg ¼ l2
MP <108 eV−3,
αg ¼ l2MP
2
< 1038 eV−1. which will lead to α2g
α2γ ∼10110. See
the appendix for more discussion on the constraints of these
couplings. That means the gravitational wave bursts asso-
ciated with the FRBs can be tremendously large. Observing
this will put a new constraint for αg, apart from the current
observation.
It is interesting to discuss the CS gravity coupling a little
more here. In UV-completed models, the CS gravity and
photon-axion couplings are considered at the same order
from compactification [42]. However in recent study [43],
as well as our concern here, the CS gravity is treated as
the low energy effective field theory with a cutoff. The
existence of the ghost mode constrains the theory in certain
parameter space, see [43] for an interesting discussion. We
refer to Fig. 2 to show some connections between two
different kinds of CS couplings. This triangle diagram is
divergent with 4 extra powers of momentum from aR ˜R
vertex and one power of momentum from each hμνTμν
coupling (see the interaction forms in [44]), and evaluated
FIG. 2.
Top: the triangle Feynman diagram, where the axion-
photon coupling is generated from axion-graviton coupling.
Bottom: the one loop diagram of graviton, which renormalizes
the axion mass term, and provides the sub-leading correction to
the axion-photon coupling.

as αγ ∼αgðΛc=MplÞ4, where Λc is the cutoff for Chern-
Simons theory. The cutoff scale Λc is considered to be
much
lower
than
the
Planck
scale,
which
implies
αg=αγ ∼ðMpl=ΛcÞ4 ≫1. Moreover, since the photon-
axion coupling is a lot much constrained, this diagram
can also be used for constraining the effect of the low
energy Chern-Simon gravity theory. Besides, aR ˜R also
induces an axion self-energy loop with two gravitons
running in the loop. This diagram is also divergent and
renormalizes the axion mass term. With a much lower
cutoff scale Λc ≪Mpl, the one loop diagram provides the
subleading correction to the axion-photon coupling. Here
we only focus on the first triangle diagram, and assume
that the axion-photon coupling is generated from axion-
graviton coupling.
For the aR ˜R term, people have mostly studied its impact
on the binary systems in the early inspiral phase, above the
LISA sensitivities. The released power PðgÞ of the gravi-
tational wave bursts can be related to the strain hðgÞ at the
detector through h2
ðgÞ ∼
κ4PðgÞ
L2ν2 [3–6]. From the FRB infor-
mation, the power PðγÞ is roughly 1042 ergs in 10−3 seconds
[16–20]. Assuming that PðgÞ=PðγÞ ≃α2g=α2γ ≃108, we have
hðgÞ ∼10−23

ð13Þ
The branching ratio in (12) implies
PðgÞ
PðγÞ ≃α2g
α2γ ≫1. Then it is
possible that hðgÞ can be greatly enhanced at the same
frequency of photons ν ¼ k=2π ¼ ma=4π ∼GHz. Though
we need to assume a much larger axion clump, instead of
the size of mini-cluster estimated only from the power
PðγÞ ∼10−12 M⊙=ms of the FRBs.
Now let us estimate the secondary effects of the gravi-
tational waves productions from the photon burst process,
with the source given by the stress energy tensor TðγÞ
μν of the
Maxwell field in (9). The discussion of the stress-energy
tensor of axion field TðaÞ
μν in (9) is similar and generalization
is straightforward. The quadrupole of the stress energy
tensor is defined as IijðtÞ ¼ R
da xixjTttðt; ⃗xÞd3x. The quad-
rupole integration is over the size of the axion object. And
for the detector at the distance of L from the source and
assuming L ≫da, we have hijðtÞ ¼ κ4
4πL̈Iijðt −LÞ. Notice
that a sphere has zero quadruple moments and only out of
the equilibrium decay process of the axion clump can
induce
the
gravitational
waves.
We
approximate
Iij ∼ϵEðγÞd2a, where EðγÞ is the total observed released
energy of the photons in FRBs, and ϵEðγÞ is the nonspheri-
cal contribution. Then hij ∼ϵ πκ4
L EðγÞd2aν2, and we will
compare this to the direct gravitational wave production
from the CS gravitational term later. Considering ϵ ∼10−8,
the strain hðaÞ and hðγÞ that our detector can receive are

Another way to estimate the quadrupole moment is
considering the nonspherical contribution ̈IðγÞ

Notice that the typical frequency k are ma and 2ma
respectively for hðγÞ and hðaÞ, generated from different
sources TðγÞ
μν and TðaÞ

diagrams of these possible signals in Fig. 3. In particular,
we expect the signals around the spinning black hole is
even stronger [25] and may be within the range of the high
frequency gravitational waves detection proposals [1,2].
When the size of the black hole is at the order of 1=ðmavaÞ,
we have the superradiance effects and the axion clouds
form. For ma ∼GHz gravitational waves, the correspond-
ing black hole mass is around 10−5 M⊙, and the bound of
strains hðaÞ becomes

where ϵc is the portion of the energy stored in the black hole
clouds, and can be taken as 10−4. It is foreseeable that the
CS term corrects the black hole superradiance effects by
some factor, e.g., see [36], or induce Kerr black hole
instability [45], although the overall order should not
change much.
One can also see more discussions on hðaÞ in a black hole
background in [1,2], corresponding to aa →g annihilation.
Also, notice here the estimations for the stain h are very
rough, since the collapsing and bursting processes are
actually very complicated. The more precise estimation
will require some involved numerical studies. From the
estimations above and related pulsars or supernovae burst
processes information, these secondary gravitational effects
without the CS gravity terms can release around 1% of total
released energy.
Above the strains are estimated for GHz fast gravita-
tional wave bursts. We expect that hðaÞ ∼hðγÞ can be
different from hðgÞ for MHz gravitational waves, and notice
that the normal drastic FRB energy oscillations induce
gravitational bursts hðaÞ ∼hðγÞ as well without the CS
gravitational coupling. For aF ˜F the particle decay process
a →γγ or aa →γγ gives rise to a gravitational wave signal
directly, although the signal is very small without the
presence of a black hole. The authors of [1,2] discussed this
kind of gravitational wave production enhanced around the
black hole. Especially for the black hole superradiance the
process aþ →a−þ g happens, where a superradiant cloud
axion emits a graviton and jumps onto a lower level, then
may get captured by the black hole horizon. A benchmark
frequency of this process can be 10−2 Hz for a 107 M⊙
black hole and a 10−17 eV axion. And this could possibly
be detected by LISA. Considering the distance between the

V. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY
We have studied the gravitational wave bursts from the
CS coupling with axion and graviton as well as the
associated FGB from FRB sources without the CS term,
though we only performed the calculation on the flat
background to demonstrate the features of the signals.
For the case with axion clouds around the spinning black
hole, the situation is more complicated. Especially the
black hole superradiance can keep on copiously producing
axions, and induce the instability around the axion clouds,
where the gravitational bursts/radio bursts can happen
periodically.
We would also like to comment on the fact that the CS
gravity has a ghost in the UV, which can be fixed by higher
order terms, e.g., [48–50]. Moreover, our discussions, even
around the black holes, are in the IR region, and it is
perturbative in the gravitational release case. The para-
metric resonance effects of both electromagnetic and
gravitational fields are important ingredients. Especially
the gravitational wave bursts can be dominant in the energy
release. In that case, the radio burst signals can be a
reference point for the gravitational releases. Notice that the
CS gravity coupling can be much larger than the axion-
photon coupling, due to the limited studies and experiments
on the bound.
For the cosmological inflation with axion term, the
GW signal/photon signal is usually circularly polarized,
since one mode is growing and the other mode is decaying.
This is due to the fact that the background field dθ
dt is with
the fixed sign. However, in our case with the oscillating
background θ ∝sinðmtÞ, both of modes are growing expo-
nentially. So the signals do not have a certain polarization.
Theoscillating backgroundonly modifies thephasefactor of
the signal modes, e.g., see [51] for a related discussion.
In summary, the gravitational wave burst signals pro-
posed here happened in the late universe and can be
strongly enhanced by the gravitational CS couplings
inside the dense axion regions. Its characteristics include
high frequencies and burst features within a short period.
For this process around the spinning black holes, we
expect some technical issues to overcome [52]. The
spinning black hole solution is corrected in CS gravity.
And the black hole accretion process and the axion cloud
dynamics are modified from this enhanced decays of
a →gg.
Detecting
the gravitational
waves of high
frequencies around kHz to GHz is also an interesting
topic for future detectors. In addition, there could be
entangled signals from particles decays, which might be
detected with the HBT interferometers, as suggested in
[53,54]. For the discussion on gravitational waves from
light primordial black holes one can refer to [55], and
recent progresses on the FRBs and resonant instability as
well as superradiance around primordial black holes can
also be found in [56–63].

general axion-like particles, the relation between fa and ma
is model dependent and we consider two parameters as
independent of each others. For a model of largely
homogenous axion vacuum dark matter and considering
that the oscillating axion accounts for no more than all dark

where ϑ0 ≡faθi. Without loss of generality, we will adopt
the phase ϕ0 ¼ 0.
Note that for now, we do not consider the spatial
dependence of the axion field value for simplicity, although
the axion field today is assumed to be incoherent across
space. It means that any large scale resonance is nearly
impossible. The incoherence is due to the realization of the
axion oscillation in the early universe, and the axions field
at the different spatial points may pick up different phases
factors. However, the local axion object can play an
important role in this electromagnetic amplification effect
and has been discussed extensively, see e.g. [12–17]. Thus,
we consider the coherent solution (A7) above as the
background solution.
We assume that the gauge potential Aμðt; zÞ is homo-
geneous in x- and y-directions and define the helicity 

for
the
Maxwell field (A6) are reduced to the formula

ðA8Þ
With the ansatz of the axion field in (A7), _¯aðtÞ is a cosine
type function. Consider the following mode,
Aðt; zÞ ¼ bðtÞeikz:

In the momentum space, the equation of motion (A8) is
reformulated as

The resonance can be achieved when a decays to the
diphoton, at the resonance frequency k ¼ ma=2. And a
typical amplification happens when μkt > 1.
Consider the size of the axion stars or mini-cluster with
average size da as the light travels through, then the total
time tγ ≃da=c ≃1=ðmavacÞ, where va is the typical
velocity inside of the clumps and the typical relation
da ≃1=ðmavaÞ where the equilibrium cluster has been
used [12–17]. Thus, the amplification factor for the
Maxwell field is eΓγtγ, with

We can see that the explosive decay of the axion clumps or
axion clouds can happen, with certain axion parameters.
At the meanwhile, we have the dynamic equation of
motion for the axion field (A5). The complete solution of
both axion and electromagnetic fields dynamics requires
numerical studies. For example, see [22] for the curved
background solution. Here we only present the qualitative
description of the process that axion oscillation induces a
burst of energy in the electromagnetic sector at the
resonance frequency and the axion fields lost energy.
With the ansatz of the axion field with the typical wave

the spacial factor in (A5) can be decomposed. It is enough
to see a couple of features in this effect to explain the FRBs.

When the Maxwell fields pass through these axion dense
objects or the axion clouds, due to the photon-axion
interaction, the coherent oscillation of axions amplifies
the Maxwell field. The result is an explosion of the photon
number in the resonance frequency k ¼ ma=2, as in the
mechanism a →γγ described in the introduction. This
effect has been amazingly linked to the observed multiple
FRBs in the galaxy, in both the axion dense object case
[12–17]
and
black

[22,29,31].
Especially, it is for the peak frequency,

with a benchmark point frequency around GHz(∼μeV).

where □¼ ∇μ∇μ and ˜ϵpki ¼ ϵtpki.

L, (B4) becomes
½̈hIðtÞ þ k2hIðtÞ½1 −εIκ4αgk_aðtÞ ¼ εIκ4αgk̈aðtÞ_hIðtÞ:
ðB6Þ
At the meanwhile, the dynamical equation of motion for the
axion field is
ð□−m2aÞa ¼ −αg
4 R ˜R:
ðB7Þ
Now we can discuss the bursts of the gravitational waves
around the axion dense object or the axion clouds around
the black hole. We use the conventions in [66,67], and the
typical peak frequency of such GW is around k ¼ ma=2
with a bandwidth κ4αgϑ0
m3a
4 . It corresponds to the process
a →gg, where an axion decays into two gravitons. This is a
different and more drastic process comparing to two axion
annihilation to the graviton process proposed in [1,2],
where no gravitational CS coupling is assumed.
The duration of the energy released in such burst is
related to the axion objects and clouds properties. In the
FRB cases, time duration is very short in milliseconds and
the energy released is around 1038 ∼1040 ergs with high
flux densities [13–17]. If we assume the same clumps
formed by axions also has the gravitational CS couplings, a
portion of the axion energy, if not all, can be released to the
gravitational waves. Notice here these two couplings are
not related to each other, without assuming certain UV
theory. If we assume such axion-like particles only have the
gravitational couplings rather than photon couplings, we
can expect the gravitational wave bursts with the similar
total energy released as the FRBs, although the duration
might be different, depending on the CS coupling.
1. The amplification factor
The amplification factor is another important parameter
of such phenomenon, especially for the expected signal to
background
ratios.
The
gravitational
waves
traveled
through the axion objects pick up an exponential factor,
while the other gravitational waves remain the background.
We can estimate that for the peak frequency, the expo-
nentiated factor is eΓgtg, where

We can now see that the observation of such bursts can
put severe constraints on the gravitational CS coupling
and axion properties. We take the current upper bound of
CS modified gravity coupling from [33], that l ≃1011 m≃
5 × 1017 eV−1. In our notations, it turns out to be
κ4αg ¼ l2
MP
< 108 eV−3;
ðB10Þ
αg ¼ l2MP

< 1038 eV−1:
ðB11Þ
Thus, if taking κ4αg ∼10−4 eV−3, ma ∼μeV and ϑ0 ∼
109 GeV in (B9), we can see that the current upper bound
of Γg
ma is around 102, which means a very large amplification
factor eΓgtg ∼e100=va, considering that va ∼10−3. In Fig. 5,
we plot the schematic diagrams of the amplification of the
gravitational wave. The energy density of the photons ρg ¼

2. Various Gravitational waves signals from axions
For the early universe, one thing we would like to
comment here is the gravitational wave production from
aF ˜F or aR ˜R terms during inflation. They are at the
frequency of 10−16 Hz to 10−10 Hz, which has been
discussed in [33] and [68–71] for the interests of the
primordial gravitational waves. For both cases, one can
solve the EM or GW modes in an FRW geometry and take
the inflationary background. For the electromagnetic case
with aF ˜F, the growing modes of the EM waves act like the
sources for the background cosmological scalar fluctua-
tions, which give rise to the near scale-invariant power
spectrum and can be probed by the CMB and large scale
structure. Especially, the tensor to scalar ratio becomes
rξ ¼ 8.1 × 107 H2
M2p ½1 þ 4.3 × 10−7 H2
M2p
e4πξ
ξ6 , where ξ ¼ αγ _a
2H.
Moreover, this tensor fluctuation can be detected in much
smaller scales when these modes exit the horizon close to
the end of inflation. And a stochastic gravitational back-
ground can be possibly detected by advanced LIGO/
VIRGO [72,73]. For the aR ˜R term one has the gravitational
wave production directly, one needs to solve the field
equations in an inflationary background. In the regime of
Θ ≡2αgH2
Mp
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2ϵ
p
< 10−5 with the slow roll parameter ϵ, one
can reach the tensor to scalar ratio
rCS
rnon-CS ∼1 þ 0.022Θ2. For
the larger Θ the analysis has some technical difficulties, for
example, the ghosts arise and the result is unknown
currently [36,74].
