Through combining theoretical models and empirical data, complexity science has increased our understanding of social
behavior of animals, in particular of social insects, primates, and ﬁsh. What are missing are studies of collective behavior of huge
swarms of birds. Recently detailed empirical data have been collected of the swarming maneuvers of large ﬂocks of thousands of
starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) at their communal sleeping site (roost). Their ﬂocking maneuvers are of dazzling complexity in their
changes in density and ﬂock shape, but the processes underlying them are still a mystery. Recent models show that ﬂocking may
arise by self-organization from rules of co-ordination with nearby neighbors, but patterns in these models come nowhere near the
complexity of those of the real starlings. The question of this paper, therefore, is whether such complex patterns can emerge by
self-organization. In our computer model, called StarDisplay, we combine the usual rules of co-ordination based on separation,
attraction, and alignment with speciﬁcs of starling behavior: 1) simpliﬁed aerodynamics of ﬂight, especially rolling during
turning, 2) movement above a ‘‘roosting area’’ (sleeping site), and 3) the low ﬁxed number of interaction neighbors (i.e., the
topological range). Our model generates patterns that resemble remarkably not only qualitative but also quantitative empirical
data collected in Rome through video recordings and position measurements by stereo photography. Our results provide new
insights into the mechanisms underlying complex ﬂocking maneuvers of starlings and other birds. Key words: collective behavior,
ﬂocking maneuvers of starlings, locomotory behavior, self-organization, swarming. [Behav Ecol 21:1349–1359 (2010)]
M
ore and more often, it has been shown that social behav-
ior of groups of animals can be understood with the help
of complexity science (Camazine et al. 2001; Hemelrijk 2002).
Combining models of self-organization with empirical data
has helped to explain diverse behavioral aspects of several
taxa (Hemelrijk 2005). For instance, the foraging and group-
ing behavior of social insects (Gautrais et al. 2003; Dussutour
et al. 2004; Ame et al. 2006) and of primates (te Boekhorst
and Hogeweg 1994a, 1994b; Hemelrijk et al. 2008; Puga-
Gonzalez et al. 2009) and the co-ordination in swarms of in-
sects (Buhl et al. 2006), of ﬁsh (Becco et al. 2006; Ward et al.
2008; Hemelrijk et al. forthcoming), and of birds in a small
ﬂock (Biro et al. 2006). However, particularly, studies of self-
organization of large ﬂocks of birds are missing. For instance,
what causes the complex ﬂocking maneuvers of tens of thou-
sands of European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) over the sleep-
ing site at night has not been solved. These aerial ﬂocking
maneuvers take place in winter in the period before migration
when starlings come together with tens of thousands of indi-
viduals at their sleeping sites. Before settling in the trees for
the night, they circle above the roost for about half an hour,
although their ﬂocks split and merge and change in shape
and density (Brodie 1976; Feare 1984; Beauchamp 1999). An
unlikely explanation was given by Selous (1931): He attrib-
uted their wheeling and turning, splitting, and merging to
‘‘telepathy’’. The aim of this paper is to study whether patterns
similar to aerial displays can be generated in models of self-
organization. We validate our model, called StarDisplay, by
comparing its patterns to empirical data recently collected
in Rome. These data consist in extensive video recordings
of these spectacular patterns (Carere et al. 2009) and the
3-dimensional positions of all individuals of 10 huge ﬂocks
consisting of thousands of starlings that were obtained using
stereo photography (Ballerini et al. 2008a, 2008b; Cavagna
et al. 2008a, 2008b). Such data are very difﬁcult to collect
because of the huge number of individuals and the large
distance of the ﬂocks from the observer (Major and Dill
1978; Pomeroy and Heppner 1992; Budgey 1998). The study
in Rome has revealed a number of interesting new traits
(Ballerini et al. 2008a). For instance, that the ﬂock banks as
a whole in the direction of banking by the individuals, that
nearest neighbors are usually located at the side, that the
shape of ﬂocks is diverse as regards its orientation in the
movement direction (e.g. whether it is longer than wide or
vice versa) and that ﬂock density is similar between back and
front (Ballerini et al. 2008b) and that ﬂock density is inde-
pendent of ﬂock size (Ballerini et al. 2008b). The latter 3 traits
differ from descriptions of ﬁsh schools in empirical data and
also in models. In ﬁsh schools, we typically ﬁnd that schools
have 1) an oblong shape, 2) high frontal density (Bumann
et al. 1997), and that 3) group density depends on the num-
ber of individuals (Kunz and Hemelrijk 2003; Hemelrijk and
Kunz 2005; Hemelrijk and Hildenbrandt 2008; Hemelrijk
et al. forthcoming).
The usual biologically oriented models of swarming are
tuned toward ﬁsh, in that they reproduce single schools with
these 3 traits, and they lack the complexity of the ﬂocking
maneuvers of starlings. These models are based on 3 rules:
individuals avoid those that are too nearby, they align with
those at intermediate distance, and are attracted to those
further away (Reynolds 1986; Huth and Wissel 1992, 1994;

Helbing et al. 2005; Parrish and Viscido 2005).
To generate starling-like patterns in a model, we have in the
present study extended our former model of ﬁsh schools
(Hemelrijk and Hildenbrandt 2008) with aspects characteris-
tic of starlings. For instance, in the new model, individuals,
like in real starlings, interact with others in their so-called
‘‘topological range’’, that is, with the nearest 6–7 neighbors,
independently of the absolute distance to them (Ballerini
et al. 2008a, 2008b). They ﬂy at cruise speed (Videler 2005)
from which they sometimes deviate to avoid collisions and to
rejoin others. Their ﬂocks remain above a sleeping site at
a certain height (Ballerini et al. 2008a; Carere et al. 2009)
because we give individuals, once they are outside the area
above the sleeping site, a horizontal attraction to return to
that area and a vertical attraction to a preferred height. As
regards their ﬂying behavior, individuals in StarDisplay expe-
rience lift, drag, and the force of gravity. They ﬂy in the same
way as supposed in some other studies of bird ﬂight, following
theories of ﬁxed wing dynamics (Norberg 1990). When ﬂying
along a curve, like real birds they roll into the direction of the
turn until they are at a certain angle to the horizontal plane,
the so-called banking angle (Videler 2005). Their tendency to
roll into the turn increases with the strength of their tendency
to turn sideward, which is due to the urge to co-ordinate with
their topological neighbors and to stay above the roost. Once
an individual has banked in the model, its tendency to roll
back is proportional to its actual banking angle.
In order to verify whether ﬂocking maneuvers of real star-
lings may arise by self-organization, the aim of the present
study is to investigate the resemblance between ﬂocking pat-
terns in the model and empirical data in Rome. We study this
resemblance in 2 ways. First, we compare the model to qual-
itative empirical data (Ballerini et al. 2008b; Carere et al.
2009). Second, we compare it to quantitative data collected
by stereo photography described in Table 1 of the paper by
Ballerini et al. (2008a, 2008b). Finally, we discuss what may
cause these patterns in the model and how these explanations
could be studied through experiments in the model and
collection of new empirical data in future.
METHODS
The model
The behavior of each individual in StarDisplay is based on its
cruise speed, its social environment (i.e., the position and
heading of its nearby neighbors), its attraction to the roost,
and the simpliﬁed aerodynamics of ﬂight that includes bank-
ing while turning. Because ﬂying implies movement in all
directions, our model is 3 dimensional. We built the model
in SI units and choose real parameter values where available
(Table 1).
Even though social co-ordination depends on internal mo-
tivations, we model it in terms of (social) forces as has been
done by others (Reynolds 1987; Couzin et al. 2002; Hemelrijk
and Hildenbrandt, 2008).
Details of behavioral rules
Each individual is characterized by its mass, m, its speed, v, and
its location, p. Its orientation in space is given by its local
co-ordinate system (ex, ey, and ez). Following the model by
Reynolds (1987), its orientation is indicated by its forward
direction, ex, its sideward direction, ey, and its upward direction,
ez, which it changes by rotating around these 3 principal axes,
ex, ey, and ez (roll, pitch, and yaw) (Figure 1).
As to its speed, a force, f si (Equation 1), brings an individ-
ual back to its cruise speed v0 after it has deviated from it
(Hemelrijk and Hildenbrandt 2008).

where s represents the relaxation time, m is the mass of the
individual i and v0 its cruise speed, vi is its velocity, and exi its
forward direction.
To represent topological interaction, each individual i in the
model adapts its metric interaction range, Ri(t) (Hemelrijk
and Hildenbrandt 2008) in such a way that individuals at-
tempt to interact only with a constant number of their closest
neighbors (Equations 2 and 3).

neighbors of an individual i which is composed of jNi(t)j
neighbors from the total ﬂock of size N, nc is the ﬁxed num-
ber of topological interaction partners it strives to have, and dij
is the distance between individual i and j given by kpj 2 pik,
where pi gives the position of an individual i. Thus, the radius
of interaction at the next step in reaction time, Ri (t 1 Du), is
increased if the number of interaction partners jNi(t)j is small-
er than the targeted number nc, and it is decreased if it is
larger than that; it remains as before if jNi(t)j equals nc. Here,
Ri can neither decrease below the hard sphere in which indi-
viduals are maximally avoiding each other rh (Equation 4,
Figure 2) nor increase beyond Rmax and s, the interpolation
factor, which determines the step size of the changes and
herewith, the variance of the number of actual inﬂuential
neighbors.
As to separation, individual i is led by a force f sito move in the
opposite direction of the average direction of the locations of
the Ni(t) others in its neighborhood (Figure 2). Following other
scientists (Couzin et al. 2002; Zheng et al. 2005), we have omit-
ted the blind angle at the back (Equation 4 and see Parameter-
ization, initial condition, and experiments). We gave individuals
a hard sphere with radius rh as mentioned above in which they
are not attracted to each other (Equation 5). Outside the hard
sphere, but inside the radius of separation rsep, the degree of
avoidance of others decreases with the distance to the neighbor
following a halved Gaussian, g(dij), with r the standard deviation
of the Gaussian set such that at the border of the separation
zone the force is almost zero, g(rsep) ¼ 0.01 (Equation 4).

Here, jNi(t)j is the number of individuals in the neighbor-

pik and ws is the ﬁxed weighting factor for separation (Table 1).
Note that if a ﬂock is thinly spread out, some individuals will
only be subject to alignment and cohesion because they are
located outside the range of separation of others.
As to cohesion (Equations 5, 6 and 7), individual i is

(Huth and Wissel 1992; Reuter and Breckling 1994; Couzin

2005), we excluded individuals located in its blind angle at its
back. Here, wc is the weighing factor for cohesion (Equation 6,
Table 1). Within the radius of the hard sphere rh, we ignore
cohesion to others. We make individuals cohere more strongly
when they are at the border of the ﬂock than in its interior by
multiplying the force of cohesion by a factor indicating the
degree to which an individual is peripheral (Equations 5 and
7). To measure this, we use its degree of ‘‘centrality’’ in the
group, Ci, calculated as the length of the average vector of the
direction toward its neighbors NG(t) (Hemelrijk and Wantia
2005). The centrality of the individual Ci(t), we base on all its
‘‘neighboring’’ individuals NG(t) in a radius of twice its actual
perceptual distance (Equation 7).

Individuals ﬂy at a similar height above the sleeping site
because we made them experience both in a horizontal and
vertical direction a force of attraction f Roost to the ‘‘roosting
area’’ (Equations 10, 11, and 12). The strength of the hori-
zontal attraction, f RoostH, is greater, the more radial it moves
away from the roost; it is weaker if it is already returning. The
sign in Equation 11 is chosen to reduce the outward heading.
The actual direction of the horizontal attraction force is given
by eyi, which is the individual’s lateral direction. Vertical at-
traction, f RoostV, is proportional to the individual’s vertical
distance from the preferred height above the roost (arbitrarily
called the 0 level). Here z is the vertical unit vector. wRoostH

where q is the density of the air and S represents the wing area

coefﬁcients. We assume that q is a constant and that the wing
areas of all birds in the model are identical, and the ratio of
the coefﬁcients CL and CD is constant (Norberg 1990). When
a bird is ﬂying horizontally while maintaining a constant
cruise speed v0, its lift balances its weight mg (i.e., mass 3
gravity) and its thrust balances its drag (Equation 15b).
Division of L by L0 and of D by L in Equation 15a and 15b
yields Equation 15c in which the lift and the drag depend on
ﬁxed values and only one variable, i.e. the actual speed.
By deﬁnition, gravity is directed toward the global ‘‘down’’
direction, g ¼ (0, 0, 2g), the lift toward the local ‘‘up’’ di-
rection ez of the bird, and the drag is pointing in the direction
opposite to the individual’s actual ‘‘forward’’ direction ex.

To represent banked turns, we ﬁrst calculate the degree to
which individuals want to turn, that is, their lateral accelera-
tion, al, which is exerted by the steering force (Figure 3).
Banking implies that the individual’s local frame rolls around
the forward axis in the direction of the lateral acceleration, al.

The degree of lateral acceleration determines the extent of
inwards banking into the turn. The intended inward angle is
given as the product of the weight for inward turning, the
strength of the lateral acceleration, and the time interval
over which it was updated (Equation 18, top row in Figure
3). To make the individual return again to level ﬂight, it
experiences also a tendency to roll out, which is larger when
the actual banking angle is greater (Equation 19). The ac-
tual banking angle (Equation 20) is the sum of the current
angle and the tendencies to roll in and to roll out (bottom
row, Figure 3). The ratio of wbin and wbout determines the roll
rate. Note that the acceleration, which was originally strictly
lateral, has after the roll, obtained a component of magni-
tude kalk sin(bin) parallel to the lift (dotted lines in the last
column, Figure 3).
After summing the forces of steering and ﬂying, we use Euler
integration to calculate the position and velocity at the end of
each time-step Dt:

Parameterization, Initial condition, and Experiments
As far as data are available, we parameterize StarDisplay to
realistic values (Table 1). Values were available for starlings
regarding body mass, lift/drag ratio, CL/CD, cruise speed
(Ward et al. 2004), and reaction time (Pomeroy and Heppner
1977). We tune the interpolation factor s (Equation 2) to
obtain the topological range jNi(t)j of starlings of nc ¼
6.5 6 1 neighbors (Ballerini et al. 2008a).
By tuning the weights for repulsion, alignment, and attrac-
tion, we adjust the steering force to the order of magnitude of
the physical forces of ﬂight, that is, around 1 Newton (L0 and
D0, Table 1). The radius of the hard sphere, rh, equals half the
starlings’ average wingspan (Ward et al. 2004; Mo¨ller 2005;
Ballerini et al. 2008b). We tune the weight of the separation
force, ws, such that no collisions occur (Potts 1984). We adjust
the separation radius, rsep, to obtain an average nearest neigh-
bor distance similar to that of the starlings of Rome (Table 2,
Supplementary Material Figure S1).
In order to force individuals to move mostly in a horizontal
area above the sleeping site, we adjust the horizontal attraction
to the roost (tuning wRoostH). The sleeping site is represented
with radius, RRoost (Table 1), of the approximate size of the
roost at Termini in Rome (Carere et al. 2009). We tune the
vertical attraction of individuals to a speciﬁc altitude (calibrat-
ing wRoostV) in order to prohibit them from ﬂying off vertically
and to produce a ‘‘ﬂat’’ ﬂock shape such as has been observed
in reality (Ballerini et al. 2008b). The modeled bird reacts to
others at its back only for movements that are really necessary:
Following Couzin et al. (2002), individuals avoid others in
their blind angle, thus all around (Figure 2), because it is very
dangerous to collide frontally with each other. Following mod-
els by others (Huth and Wissel 1992), there is a blind angle
for the forces of alignment and cohesion because it is more
difﬁcult to react to others when the others are located at the
back. We adjust the ﬂying behavior by observing the behavior
of a single individual in ﬂocks of several sizes. We tune the
relaxation parameter of the speed s in combination with the
vertical attraction to the roost wRoostV so that ﬂocks stay at
similar altitude when they are not disturbed. The reaction
time of individuals is represented by the update time of the
‘‘steering’’ force (Du seconds, Equation 2). This interval we
make longer than the time step of integration of the location
and speed (of Dt seconds, see Equations 21 and 22). Due to
their ‘‘slow’’ reaction, minor errors in navigation result. We
also add a random force scaled to 10% of the steering force. It
reﬂects random errors, for example, in perception and control
of movement (Equations 13 and 14).
We have made side-by-side comparisons of the visualization
of the model and video recordings in Rome from Claudio
Carere. To tune our model, we adjusted parameters of bank-
ing, wbin and wbout, so that the roll rates and bank angles match
those observed in the videos of real ﬂocks, and controlled the
weight of the alignment force, wa, to obtain the strong polar-
ization of real starlings.
At the beginning of each simulation, individuals start with
random orientations at random positions inside a cylinder
with radius, RRoost.
Measurements and statistical analysis
All variables are measured 10 times per second during 2 min
(Table 2). Nearest neighbor distances are averaged per ﬂock.
To avoid effects of the ﬂock border (Ballerini et al. 2008b), we
consider only individuals in the interior of the ﬂock. In the
interior of the ﬂock, individuals are surrounded at all sides by
others as reﬂected by their values of centrality Ci(t) (Equation
7) being smaller than 0.35. The angular distribution of near-
est neighbors of all individuals is measured as the distribution
of cosines of the angle h between the forward direction of an

inwards over an angle b in
order to take the turn. Bottom

individual and the vector to its nearest neighbor. In a circle
around the individuals, angles are labeled as follows: A nearest
neighbor that is straight ahead is deﬁned as having and angle
h of zero, thus, its cosine is 11. Exactly, orthogonally at either
side is deﬁned as being under an angle h of 90 (thus, its
cosine is 0), precisely behind implies an angle h of 180 (thus
a cosine of 21), ‘‘etcetera.’’
The volume of a ﬂock is measured by mapping the position of
the individuals on a cubic lattice and counting the occupied lat-
tice cells, so-called voxelization. For this, the cell size is adapted
to the average distance to the nearest neighbors in the ﬂock.
Balance shift is computed as the difference between center
of mass and geometrical center divided by the length of the
axis along the direction of motion. Positive values indicate
higher frontal density.
The ﬂock dimensions are measured by means of the mini-
mum-volume bounding box of the ﬂock. This bounding box
is calculated by means of a principal component analysis of
the co-ordinates of the ﬂock members (Barequet and Har-
Peled 2001) (Movie S3). The eigenvectors that are associated
with the largest/medium/smallest eigenvalue of the covari-
ance matrix provide a co-ordinate system oriented along the
axes deﬁning the longest/medium/shortest dimensions of
the ﬂock, respectively, I3, I2, I1.
Orientation parameters (Ballerini et al. 2008b) are given by
3 angles, the angle between the shortest dimension of the
ﬂock I1 and gravity G, between the shortest dimension I1
and the direction of movement of the ﬂock’s center of mass
V, and between gravity G and the direction of movement of
the ﬂock’s center of mass V. These angles are represented by
the absolute values of the dot products (which represent the
cosines of these angles), jI1Gj, jVI1j and jVGj.
Flock banking is calculated every 0.1 s for 8 min. Given that
I1 is the ‘‘up’’-direction of the bounding box (because the
ﬂock is ﬂat) and V is the direction of movement of the ﬂock’s
center of mass, the banking of the ﬂock is the angle between
the horizontal plane and the vector orthogonal to the plane
spanned by I1 and V (thus I1 3 V, where ‘‘3’’ indicates the
cross product).
We have used nonparametric statistics (the Wilcoxon
matched-pairs signed-ranks test and the Kendall tau correla-
tions) to avoid the difﬁculty of determining for small sample
sizes whether data are distributed according to a normal distri-
bution. For sample sizes above 10, we used the Pearson corre-
lation because it is robust as regards the distribution of data
(Sokal and Rohlf 1995). To be conservative, we have only con-
sidered 2-tailed probabilities.
Video recordings and other empirical data
The ‘‘quantitative’’ data of stereo photography were taken at
the roost in the city center close to the central station ‘‘Ter-
mini’’ in Rome (Ballerini et al. 2008b). They were taken of
ﬂocks that were not threatened by attacks from predators.
Predator attacks by falcons (Falco peregrinus) have been shown
to inﬂuence the ﬂocking patterns (Carere et al. 2009). For our
‘‘qualitative’’ empirical data, we used video recordings of
ﬂocks of the same roost taken between 19 January 2006 and
17 March 2006 and between 12 December 2006 and 2 March
2007 with a HD video camera (JY-HD10, JVC).

(Supplementary Material Figure S2), 2) the trajectories of
groups and individuals during a turn (Figures 5A and 6), 3)
their changes in shape and density over time (Movies 1 and 2
of the model vs. Movie S6 and Figure 6), and 4) the way
complete ﬂocks tilt sideward while they are turning (Figure
5B). The movement paths and changes of shape and density
of ﬂocks in the model can be compared with data of real
starlings only qualitatively because quantitative data of time
series do not yet exist. In the model, the degree of banking by
individuals is correlated with the curvature j of their paths
(Figure 6A); the turn starts by the banking of the individuals
(Figure 6A, I–II), leading to loss of effective lift (Figure 6B,
I–II) and altitude and thus, to increase of vertical speed
(Figure 6B, I–II). After passing the apex of the turn, banking
diminishes (Figure 6A, II–III) and effective lift is gained
(Figure 6B, II–III), whereas there is still a loss of altitude, which
causes increase in horizontal speed (Figure 6C, II–III). Subse-
quently, individuals slowly return to level ﬂight (Figure 6A, III–
IV), to their original altitude and horizontal speed (Figure 6C,
III–IV). While turning, the ﬂock is compressed (Figure 6D),
and although its thickness remains similar, its relative propor-
tions change, particularly the largest over the shortest dimen-
sion, I3/I1 (Figure 6E). Thus, the variation of ﬂock shape arises
in the model mostly during turning, and due to this variability,
the shape of the ﬂock is often not oblong (Movie S3).
In small ﬂocks in the model, the trajectories of all individuals
during turns are similar in length and in radius (Figure 5A,
Movie S5): individuals after the turn end up in another loca-
tion inside the ﬂock. For instance, during the right turn in
Figure 5A, the ‘‘square’’ individual is initially located in the
left of the ﬂock (at T ¼ 0 s), but after the turn (T ¼ 3 s), it
is located at the right side (grey line). Note that in this case,
the shape of the ﬂock is unchanged, but its orientation has
changed relative to the movement direction because the point
of the triangle (connecting 3 individuals) initially points back-
wards (T ¼ 0 s), but after the turn (3, 6 s), it points forward.
During spontaneous turns of smaller ﬂocks in the model,
sometimes the whole ﬂock banks in the direction of individual
banking, so-called ‘‘ﬂock banking’’ (e.g., M32-06, Figure 5B).
This is apparent from the correlation between the degree of
banking of the complete ﬂock and the average degree by its
members. It is found only in small ﬂocks and during smooth
turns.
Comparison to quantitative empirical data
In order to compare quantitative properties of 10 modeled
ﬂocks to the 10 corresponding ﬂock events in Rome (Table 1
of Ballerini et al. 2008b), we ﬁrst adjusted the following 3
traits to those of each of the 10 empirical ﬂock events: ﬂock
size (N), speed (by tuning cruise speed v0), and average dis-
tance to the nearest neighbor (by tuning the separation radius
rsep). Next, we showed that for each of the 10 empirical
ﬂock events, a ﬂock in the model could be found that resem-
bled its empirical counterpart in many respects (Table 2 and
Figure 7A,B, for signiﬁcance tests, see Supplementary Material
Table S1).
Just as in the empirical data, in the modeled ﬂocks, the
balance shift was low, which indicates that the density is similar
at front and back of the ﬂock (ME1, Table 2).
The shape of all ﬂocks as measured through the aspect ratios
of the shorter dimensions, I2/I1, and the longest divided by
the shortest dimension I3/I1 was similar and resembled the
empirical values (ME2 and 3, Table 2). Just as in empirical
data, I3/I1 did neither depend on ﬂock size nor volume
(C1 and 2, Table 2), but in contrast to empirical data, ﬂock
shape measured by the aspect ratio I2/I1 did depend on ﬂock
size and volume: Larger ﬂocks (whether in number or in
volume) are more asymmetric, and smaller ones are closer
to being spherical (C3 and 4, Table 2).
As in empirical data, in StarDisplay, the plane of the ﬂock
was oriented parallel to the ground as measured by studying
to what degree the shortest dimension of the ﬂock I1 was
parallel to the gravity G and, therefore, jI1Gj was close to 1.
Despite the similarity of the average values in the model
jI1Gj ¼ 0.97 6 0.04 and empirical data jI1Gj ¼ 0.92 6 0.06,
the plane of the modeled ﬂocks was signiﬁcantly more parallel
to the ground. Flocks moved mostly at a constant height above
the ground, and therefore, both dot products were on average
low, that is, jVGj of the movement direction and the direction
of gravity and jVI1j of the angle between the velocity and the
direction of the shortest dimension. However, the modeled
ﬂocks showed a smaller variation in altitude above the ground,
that is, the average value of jVGj ¼ 0.03 6 0.04 was lower than
in empirical data jVGj 5 0.13 6 0.06, even though the average
values of jVI1j were similar, that is, in StarDisplay jVI1j ¼ 0.15
6 0.14 and in the empirical data jVI1j ¼ 0.19 6 0.11. Thus,
compared with the empirical data, our modeled ﬂocks ﬂew on
average more horizontal and more parallel to the ground.
In the model, the thickness and volume are signiﬁcantly
smaller than in the empirical data (ME7 and 8, Table 2).
As in the empirical data, in our model, the nearest neighbor
distance (NND) appears to be independent of group size for
the 10 ﬂocks (C7, Table 2) and also for 10 replicas of an even
larger range of group sizes than the empirical data (viz. for
a group size of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900,

separation rsep, Pearson correlation, N ¼ 140, r ¼ 0.32, P ¼
0.14).
For the following measures of internal structure, 1) the dis-
tribution of the distances to the nearest neighbors and 2) of
the angles to the nearest neighbors, we compare our modeled
ﬂocks to their corresponding empirical ﬂock. Of the empirical
ﬂock events E25-11 and E32-06, the frequency distribution of
the distances to the nearest neighbors shows a peak around the
hard sphere of 0.4 m, and the distribution is skewed to the
right as measured by the second derivative of the shape of
the curve (skewness for E25-11 and E32-06 are, respectively,
10.36 and 10.39). In the model of the corresponding ﬂocks,
the skew is also to the right (skewness for M25-11 and M32-06
are, respectively, 10.37 and 10.54, Figure 7A).
In empirical data of 4 ﬂocks (E32-06, E17-06, E25-10, and
E25-11), the frequency distribution of the angle between the
heading of the individual and the location of the nearest
neighbor (i.e., ‘‘bearing angle’’) shows that the closest neigh-
bors are lacking along the direction of the movement. In the
corresponding 4 ﬂocks of StarDisplay (M32-06, M17-06, M25-
10, and M25-11), we ﬁnd a similar distribution of bearing
angles (compare model data in squares to empirical data in
circles, Figure 7B).
DISCUSSION
Insights from the model
In line with earlier models of swarming (Couzin et al. 2002;
Hemelrijk and Kunz 2005; Parrish and Viscido 2005; Buhl
et al. 2006; Hemelrijk and Hildenbrandt 2008), our model
StarDisplay shows that the ﬂocking maneuvers of starlings
may result from local interactions only. The interactions are
local because they take place in a space (of ,10 m3) that is
much smaller than that of the complete ﬂock (which ranges
between 500 and 17.000 m3, Table 2). StarDisplay shows that
neither perception of the complete ﬂock nor any leadership
or complex cognition is needed. With this result, the model
reduces the need for perceptual and cognitive assumptions
for the individual birds. As long as there is no evidence to
the contrary, a model based on local perception and simple
cognition is to be preferred to a model that assumes that the
individual interacts with the whole group.
Density is independent of ﬂock size, and it is similar in the
front half and back half, both in our model and in empirical
data of starlings (Ballerini et al. 2008b). This may be due to
the individual’s short range of interaction, which involves
a low and constant number of (topological) interaction part-
ners (Ballerini et al. 2008a). The greater density that is associ-
ated with larger groups of ﬁsh (Breder 1954; Keenleyside
1955; Nursall 1973; Partridge 1980; Partridge et al. 1980) is
explained in our models by a greater attraction among a high-
er number of individuals in larger groups (Kunz and
Hemelrijk 2003; Hemelrijk and Kunz 2005; Hemelrijk and
Hildenbrandt 2008). This difference may indicate that ﬁsh
interact with a higher number of inﬂuential neighbors than
starlings do. To study this, modeling experiments with topo-
logical range should be done. Further, the independence of
density and ﬂock size and absence of high frontal density in
starlings may also follow from the frequent turns the ﬂocks
take because in turning, groups are compressed, and this
compression may neutralize the effect of the group size. To
omit the effects of turning in empirical data and in our model
StarDisplay, ﬂocks should be studied when they are traveling
in a straight line for a longer period (i.e., outside the roost).
In empirical data of starlings by Ballerini et al. (2008b), the
aspect ratios of ﬂocks were ﬁxed and independent of ﬂock
size. However, in StarDisplay, aspect ratios vary with time and
ﬂock size. This maybe due to a bias in the selection of events
of real ﬂocks. Investigators may have selected only large ﬂocks
(i.e., with more than 447 individuals) that traveled in a straight
line. This is also the kind of ﬂocks we had to chose in our
model in order to match their empirical data (Table 2). In our
model, variability of relative dimensions of ﬂocks is a conse-
quence of abrupt turns, which lead to temporarily compres-
sion of the ﬂock (Figure 6). To verify these suggestions, we
have to measure in empirical data of starling ﬂocks 1) whether
aspect ratios of ﬂock shape change over time and 2) whether
turns are the major cause of these shape changes (in the
absence of predation).
Through our model, we develop a hypothesis about the
interconnection between 3 traits described empirically (Ballerini
et al. 2008b): 1) while turning, the shape of the ﬂock changes
in relation to the direction of movement, 2) while turning, all
individuals of a ﬂock follow paths of the same length with
equal radii in real starlings and rock doves (Pomeroy and
Heppner 1992), and 3) in starlings, the neighbors that are
nearest are rarely located behind or ahead. Our model con-
ﬁrms these 3 traits (Figures 5A, 6A,D,E, and 7B). They may be
interconnected as follows. Because individuals follow paths of
the same length while turning, this means that they turn with-
out speeding up or slowing down, and therefore, their speed
variance is low. Low speed variance in a turn causes the shape
of the ﬂock to change in relation to the movement direction;
avoiding collisions by turning away rather than by speeding up
or slowing down may bring their closest neighbors at their
side more often (Figure 7B). This may be useful because col-
lisions at an equal speed from the side may be less harmful
than those caused by speeding up and slowing down. These
suggested interrelations must be investigated in empirical and
theoretical studies.

Limitations of the model
StarDisplay produces lower values than those in the empirical
data in 4 aspects, namely, the volume and thickness of the
starling ﬂocks, the variation in altitude above the ground,
and the deviation from the plane of the ﬂock from being
parallel to the ground. All 4 differences may be interrelated:
They may be due to the absence of frequent disturbances in
the model, such as predators, wind, rain, and change in light-
ing conditions. The relevance for real starlings of this hypoth-
esis may be investigated by studying in real starlings whether
attacks of a predator cause ﬂocks to increase in volume on
average (due to continuous reshufﬂing). This is a counter-in-
tuitive hypothesis because on the short term, a predator attack
may cause compression of the ﬂock, for example, to a ball
shape.
Further,
in
our model,
robustness

parameter
changes must be studied in greater depth. Because we were
interested in modeling the ﬂocking maneuvers of starlings in
Rome, we have not systematically studied different parame-
ters, apart from a range of empirically measured lift/drag
ratios (Mo¨ller 2005). For these values of ratios of lift/drag,
the results of the model showed no change.
A general often heard criticism of models that are based on
many parameters is that they are lacking in explanatory value
because they too easily ﬁt single patterns. However, most of
our parameters are ‘‘ﬁxed’’ because they depend on data of
starlings. Further, we have generated as emergent phenomena
not merely a single pattern, but many of them. We have fol-
lowed the so-called bottom-up procedure in which we trace
the connection between simple behavioral rules and collective
patterns (Hemelrijk 2002). Further, StarDisplay may be used
as a ‘‘prediction’’ for empirical data. This concerns its ﬂock
dynamics over time because despite qualitative resemblance

In sum, we demonstrate in our model StarDisplay that local
interactions and self-organization sufﬁce to reproduce pat-
terns of aerial display of starlings qualitatively and in many
cases also quantitatively. In future, we will study the causes
of these patterns in the model. Our model-based hypotheses
may be useful in indicating suitable topics for empirical re-
search of collective ﬂocking maneuvers not only of starlings
but also of other birds. This may be particularly useful because
the empirical study of huge swarms is labor intensive.

(A) Distribution of nearest neighbor distance of 2 ﬂocks that differ in their average density (Table 2). Closed circles: empirical data from ﬂock
E25-11, solid line: corresponding ﬂock in the model M25-11. Open circles: empirical data from ﬂock E32-06, dotted line: corresponding ﬂock
M32-06. (B) Distribution of directions of nearest neighbor (i.e., ‘‘bearing angles’’). Open circles: average angular distribution of the
corresponding empirical data E21-06, E32-06, E25-10, and E25-11 after (Ballerini et al. 2008b). Black rectangles: average angular distribution of
the modeled ﬂocks M21-06, M32-06, M25-10, and M25-11. Correlation with empirical distribution: Kendall tau, N ¼ 9, s ¼ 0.72, P , 0.01.
Absolute difference between distribution in model and empirical data: Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test, N ¼ 9, sr ¼ 14, not signifcant.
Dashed gray curve: averaged nearest neighbor distribution of 100 randomly chosen ﬂocks in the model. Dashed line: expected value for
a random isotropic system Prandom(cos(h)) ¼ 0.5. Error bars: standard error.
