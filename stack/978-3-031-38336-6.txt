The Emergence, Complexity and Computation (ECC) series publishes new devel-
opments, advancements and selected topics in the ﬁelds of complexity, computa-
tion and emergence. The series focuses on all aspects of reality-based computation
approaches from an interdisciplinary point of view especially from applied sciences,
biology, physics, or chemistry. It presents new ideas and interdisciplinary insight on
the mutual intersection of subareas of computation, complexity and emergence and
its impact and limits to any computing based on physical limits (thermodynamic and
quantum limits, Bremermann’s limit, Seth Lloyd limits…) as well as algorithmic
limits (Gödel’s proof and its impact on calculation, algorithmic complexity, the
Chaitin’s Omega number and Kolmogorov complexity, non-traditional calculations
like Turing machine process and its consequences,…) and limitations arising in arti-
ﬁcial intelligence. The topics are (but not limited to) membrane computing, DNA
computing, immune computing, quantum computing, swarm computing, analogic
computing, chaos computing and computing on the edge of chaos, computational
aspects of dynamics of complex systems (systems with self-organization, multiagent
systems, cellular automata, artiﬁcial life,…), emergence of complex systems and its
computational aspects, and agent based computation. The main aim of this series is
to discuss the above mentioned topics from an interdisciplinary point of view and
present new ideas coming from mutual intersection of classical as well as modern
methods of computation. Within the scope of the series are monographs, lecture
notes, selected contributions from specialized conferences and workshops, special
contribution from international experts.

Preface
The fungi is the largest, widely distributed and the oldest group of living organisms.
The smallest fungi are microscopic single cells. The largest mycelium occupies over
dozens of hectares and weighs several tons. Fungi possess almost all the senses as
humans do. They sense light, chemicals, gases, gravity and electric ﬁelds. Fungi
exhibit an electrical response to stimulation in a matter of seconds or minutes. The
book looks at fungi from an unusual perspective—as sensors, electronic devices and
future computers. The book offers fungal electronics and computing as an alternative
to currently adopted methodologies used to manufacture electronic devices with a
high degree of negative environmental impacts. There are ﬁve parts. The ﬁrst part
analyses endogenous fungal electrical activity, its complexity and how it is affected
by anaesthesia. The second part is about fungal sensors and reactive wearables. There
we discuss reactions of fungi to mechanical, chemical and optical stimuli. We stim-
ulate fungi with heavy weights, white light, ethanol, sugars, stretching and human
stress hormones. Living fungal insoles, which could, potentially, detect a posture
of a wearer, are presented there as well. The third part is about fungal electronics.
There we present experimental prototype of fungal oscillators, capacitors, memris-
tors and low pass ﬁlters. Several prototypes of fungal computers are presented in
the fourth part of the book. There we present spiking-based computing on fungal
colonies, discrimination of electrical frequencies by composites colonised by fungi,
electrical fungal gates and mining logical circuits in living fungal substrates. The
ﬁfth, and the last, part of the book is devoted to fungal language and cognition.
It introduces us to fungal language and fungal cognition. The chapters are written
by world-leading experts in computer science, engineering, electronics, biophysics
and architecture. The book is the encyclopaedia, the ﬁrst-ever complete authoritative
account, of the theoretical and experimental ﬁndings in the sensing and computing of
fungi written by the people who pioneered the ﬁeld of fungal machines. All the chap-
ters are self-contained, and no specialist background is required to appreciate ideas,

Fungal Electrical Activity

Action Potential Like Spikes in Oyster
Fungi Pleurotus Djamor
Andrew Adamatzky
Abstract We record extra-cellular electrical potential of fruit bodies of oyster fungi
Pleurotus djamor. We demonstrated that the fungi generate action potential like
impulses of electrical potential. Trains of the spikes are observed. Two types of
spiking activity are selected: high-frequency (period 2.6min) and low-freq (period
14min); transitions between modes of spiking are illustrated. An electrical response
of fruit bodies to short (5 s) and long (60 s) thermal stimulation with open ﬂame
is analyses in details. We show that non-stimulated fruit bodies of a cluster react to
thermal stimulation, with a single action-potential like spike, faster than the stimulate
fruit body does.

Introduction
Electricity is one of key factors shaping growth and development of fungi. Polarity
and branching of mycelium are induced by electric ﬁelds [1]. Hyphae are polarised
in electric ﬁelds [2]: sites of germ tube formation and branching, the direction of
hyphal extension and the frequency of branching and germination could be affected
by electric ﬁeld. Fungi also produce internal electrical currents and ﬁelds. Electrical
current is generated by a hypha: positive current, more likely carried by protons [3],
enters tip of a growing hypha [4, 5]. Current density reported is up to 0.6 µA/cm2 [3].
Electrostatic repulsion of charged basidiospores propulses the spores from alike
charged basidium [6, 7]. The electrical current can be involved or associated with
translocation of material in pair with hydraulic pressure [8]. There are evidences of
electrical current participation in the interactions between mycelium and plant rots
during formation of mycorrhiza [9].
In 1976 Slayman, Long and Gradmann discovered action potential like spikes
using intra-cellular recording of mycelium of Neurospora crassa [10]. Four types
of action potential have been identiﬁed: (1) spontaneous quasi-sinusoidal ﬂuctu-
ations of 10–20 mV amplitude, period 3–4 min, (2) as previous but shorter period

of 20–30 s, (3) cyanide induced oscillation of progressively lengthening period, start-
ing with initial depolarisation of 20–60 mV, and (4) damped sinusoidal oscillations
with amplitude 50–100 mV, period 0.2–2 mins. In 19995 Olsson and Hansson demon-
strated spontaneous action potential like activity in a hypha of Pleurotus ostreatus
and Armillaria bulbosa; they conducted intra-cellular recording with reference elec-
trode in agar substrate [11]. They shown that resting potential is –70 to –100 mV,
amplitude of spikes varies from 5 to 50 mV, duration from 20 to 500 ms, frequency
0.5–5 Hz.
Olsson and Hansson shown that frequency of spiking increases in response to
stimulating a hypha with a sulphuric acid, malt extract, water, fresh piece of wood.
When stimulus is removed the frequency decreases and then increases again if object
is re-introduced. Olsson and Hansson [11] speculated that electrical activity could
be used for communication with message propagation speed 0.5mm/s. Changes in
frequency of oscillation of a hypha in response to a wide range of stimuli reported
in [11] matches results of our personal studies with slime mould Physarum poly-
cephalum, see overview in [12]. We established a mapping between volatile chemi-
cals, wavelength of light and tactile stimulation, one side, and changes in frequency
of oscillations of electrical potential of slime mould’s protoplasmic tubes, on other
side [13–16]; and, designed a prototype of a slime mould based sensor devices [17].
To advance our bio-sensing concepts to fungi and evaluate a possibility of using
wild fungi in situ as sensors we conducted experiments on electrical activity of fungi
in conditions more close to natural conditions than experiments [10, 11] on intra-
cellular recording of a hypha conducted in laboratory conditions with mycelium
growing on a nutrient agar substrate. For our experiments, we chosen oyster mush-
room, species Pleurotus, family Tricholomataceae, they are most widely cultivated
family of fungi [18] with proven medicinal properties [19], and they are amongst few
species of carnivorous mushrooms [20] which might add some not common sensing
properties.

Methods
We used commercial mushroom growing kits (© Espresso Mushroom Company,
Brighton, UK) of pink oyster mushrooms Pleurotus djamor. Each substrate’s bag
was 22 by 10 by 10cm, 800–900 g in weight. The bag was placed was cross-sliced
10cm vertical and 8cm horizontal and placed in a cardboard box with 8 by 10cm
opening. The fungi kits were kept at room temperature in constant (24 h) ambient
lighting of 10 lux.
Electrical potential of fruit bodies was recorded from the second-third day of
their emergence. Resistance between cap and stalk of a fruit body was 1.5 M in
average, between any two heads in the cluster 2 M (measured by Fluke 8846A). We
recorded electrical potential difference between cap and stalk of the fruit body. We
used subdermal needle electrodes with twisted cable (© SPES MEDICA SRL Via
Buccari 21 16153 Genova, Italy). Recording electrode was inserted into stalk and

reference electrode in the translocation zone of the cap (Fig.1a); distance between
electrodes was 3–5 cm. In each cluster we recorded 4–6 fruit bodies simultaneously
(Fig.1b, c) for 2–3 days.
ElectricalactivityoffruitbodieswasrecordedwithADC-24HighResolutionData
Logger (Pico Technology, St Neots, Cambridge shire, UK). The data logger ADC-24
employs differential inputs, galvanic isolation and software-selectable sample rates
all contribute to a superior noise-free resolution; its 24-bit A/D converted maintains
a gain error of 0.1%. Its input impedance is 2 M for differential inputs, and offset
error is 36 µV in ± 1250 mV range use. We recorded electrical activity one sample
per second; during the recording the logger makes as many measurements as possible
(typically up 600) per second then saves average value.

Results
Here we provide evidence that fruit bodies exhibit spontaneous spiking behaviour,
we also characterise types of trains of spikes observed. When calling the spikes spon-
taneous we mean they are not invoked by an intentional external stimulation, i.e. not
expected by an external observer. Otherwise, the spikes indeed reﬂect physiological
and morphological processes ongoing in mycelial networks and growing fruit bod-
ies. We also provide evidence that fruit bodies respond to external stimulation by
changing its electrical potential and that neighbours of stimulated fruit bodies might
show action-potential like response.
3.1
Spontaneous Spiking
The electrical activity of fruit bodies shows a rich combination of slow (hours)
drift of base electrical potential combined with relatively fasts (minutes) oscillations
of the potential, see example at Fig.2a. We observed trains of spikes of electrical
potential. Each spike resembles an action potential where all ‘classical’ part can be
found (Fig.2b): depolarisation, repolarisation, refractory period. The exemplar spike
shown in (Fig.2b) has a period of 130 s, from base level potential to refractory-like
period, depolarisation rate 0.05 mV/s, repolarisation rate is 0.02 mV/s, refractory
period is c. 360 s.
We observed two types of spike trains: high-frequency (H-spikes), a spike per c.
2.6min, and low-frequency (L-spikes), a spike per c. 14min, see examples in Fig.3.
Characteristics of the spikes are shown in Table1. Period of L-spoke is ﬁve time
longer than period of H-spikes. Amplitudes of H-spikes are just below 1 mV and of
L-spikes is nearly 1.5 mV.
Durations and depolarisation rates of L- and H-spikes are nearly the same. A
repolarisation rate of L-spikes is a double of the repolarisation rate of H-spikes.
Refractory period of L-spikes is ten times longer than the period of H-spikes. Trains
of H-spikes last for up to two-and-half hours while trains of L-spikes for up to six
hours. Transitions between trains of H-spikes and L-spikes have been also observed,
see example in Fig.4.
3.2
Response to Stimulation
To check if there will be any changes in electrical potential in response to stimu-
lation we applied 50 µL of 40% ethanol, tap water, polydimethylsiloxane on top
of fruit bodies’ caps and thermally stimulated edges of the caps with open ﬂame

Fig. 4 Example of transition from a train of H-spikes to a train of L-spikes. Electrical potential of
two fruit bodies of the same cluster are shown by black solid and green dashed lines
Response of non-stimulated fruit bodies to the short-term thermal stimulation
of a member of their cluster is shown in Fig.5b. While the stimulated fruit body
responded to a thermal stimulation after c. 103 s delay, two other fruit bodies in the
same cluster shown shorter latency times of their responses. One body responded
with a positive spike 26 s after stimulation (green dotted line in Fig.5b), amplitude
c. 1.2 mV, duration 21 s. Another body responded with a negative spike 51 s after
stimulation (blue dash-dot line in Fig.5b), amplitude c. 1 mV, duration 26.3 s.
The fruit bodies’ response to a long term thermal stimulation—subjecting an edge
of a cap to an open ﬂame for 60 s, was demonstrated to be highly pronounced. A
typical response is shown in Fig.6a. At ﬁrst we observe an action potential like
response of the stimulated fruit body, with depolarisation up c. 1.4 mV, followed by
repolarisation by 2 mV. This response lasts 7.6 s. It is immediately followed by a
high-amplitude depolarisation. There electrical potential grows by 38.2 mV in 18.4 s
followed by slow repolarisation and returning to the base potential in 83 s. Other
fruit bodies react with short-living spikes to the long-term thermal stimulation of a
member of their cluster. Example is shown in Fig.6b. Four seconds after start of the
stimulation, there is a sharp depolarisation by 5.2 mV reached in 1.38 s. It follows
by repolarisation by 6.2 mV reached in 20 s. There is an indication of a refractory
period c. 59 s. The potential returns closely to its base (for this fruit body) level after
stimulation ends.

Discussion
Fruit bodes, stromata, are made of interwoven hyphae, organic continuation of a
mycelium. Thus by inserting electrodes in cap and stalk we measured extracellular
electrical potential difference between the cap and the stalk as generated by interwo-
ven hyphae. We observed trains of action potential like spikes. Microtubule bundles
observed in basidiomycetae [22] may be responsible for propagation of trains of
action potential like spikes. Amplitudes of spikes measured were very low compar-

ing to amplitudes reported in [10, 11] because the works cited used intra-cellular
recording while we used extra-cellular.
Periods of spikes evidenced in [10] 0.2–2min, are comparable with period 2.5–
3min of high frequency spikes in our experiments. High frequency of oscillations of
oyster fungi also similar to that recorded in slime mould of Physarum polycephalum:
electrical potential between two electrodes connected by a protoplasmic tube oscil-
lates with period 1–2min [23–26]. In slime mould the calcium waves are reﬂected
in oscillations of external membrane potential and periodic reversing of cytoplas-
mic ﬂow in the tubes. Drawing up analogies between the slime mould and mycelial
fungi we speculate that trains of spikes recorded in fruit bodies correlate, or even
responsible for, translocation of nutrients and relocation of product of metabolism
and communication. There are indication, see e.g. timing of spikes recorded from
two fruit bodies of the same cluster in Fig.4, that trains of spikes are coming from
the mycelium, where they most likely originate in way similar to calcium waves in
slime mould P. polycephalum.
With regards to communicative function of the spikes, fungi responds to stimu-
lation with singular spikes of electrical potential in their fruit bodies. Amplitude of
the response is higher in the stimulated body than in its non-stimulated neighbours.
However, non-stimulated members of the cluster respond earlier to the stimulation
than the stimulated body itself. These response of the non-stimulated bodies to a
destructive stimulation of one of the cluster’s members might be seen either as a
‘byproduct’ of an electrical potential deviations propagating from the damaged body
through the mycelium network towards intact bodies or a purposeful signal to the
intact bodies aimed at speeding up their growth and maturation to shorten a period
leading to accelerated production of spores. As shown in [27] (cited by [28]) sporu-
lation could be induced by partial desiccation, and a number of fruit bodies could be
larger in proximity of injury. This observation is in line with ﬁnding that damaged
mycelium responds with branching [29]; and, similar to sprouting response of a slime
mould P. polycephalum to a dissection of its protoplasmic tubes [30].

On Electrical Spiking of Ganoderma
Resinaceum
Andrew Adamatzky and Antoni Gandia
Abstract Fungi exhibit action-potential like spiking activity. Up to date most elec-
trical activity of oyster fungi has been characterised in sufﬁcient detail. It remains
unclear if there are any patterns of electrical activity speciﬁc only for a certain set of
species or if all fungi share the same ‘language’ of electrical signalling. We use pairs
of differential electrodes to record extracellular electrical activity of the antler-like
sporocarps of the polypore fungus Ganoderma resinaceum. The patterns of the elec-
trical activity are analysed in terms of frequency of spiking and parameters of the
spikes. The indicators of the propagation of electrical activity are also highlighted.

Introduction
Action-potential spikes are an essential component of the information processing sys-
tem in a nervous system [1–4]. Creatures without a nervous system—plants, slime
moulds and fungi—might also use the spikes of electrical potential for coordina-
tion and decision-making. There is mounting evidence that plants use the electrical
spikes for a long-distance communication aimed to coordinate the activity of their
bodies [5–7]. The spikes of electrical potential in plants relate to a motor activ-
ity [8–11], responses to changes in temperature [12], osmotic environment [13] and
mechanical stimulation [14, 15]. There is evidence of electrical current participation
in the interactions between mycelium and plant roots during formation of mycor-
rhiza [16].
Oscillations of electrical potential in slime mould Physarum polycephalum were
discoveredinthelate1940s[17]andstudiedextensively[18–20].Itwasdemonstrated
that patterns of electrical activity of the slime mould change in response to stimulation
with volatile chemicals, wavelength of light, and tactile stimulation [21–25].

A. Adamatzky and A. Gandia
In 1976 Slayman, Long and Gradmann discovered action potential-like spikes
using intra-cellular recording of mycelium of Neurospora crassa [26]. Periods of
spikes evidenced in [26] were 0.2–2min.1 In experiments with recording of electri-
cal potential of oyster fungi Pleurotus djamor we discovered two types of spiking
activity: high-frequency (period 2.6min) and low-freq (period 14min) [28]. In semi-
automated analysis of the electrical spiking activity of the hemp substrate colonised
by mycelium of Pleurotus djamor we found that a predominant spike width is
c. 6min [29].
A question arises—“Are characteristics and patterns of electrical potential spiking
the same for all species of fungi or there are some species speciﬁc parameters of the
fungal electrical activity?”. Aiming to ﬁnd an answer we recorded and analysed
electrical activity of Ganoderma resinaceum sporocarps. We have been studying the
electrical activity of this fungus previously [30] however only electrical responses to
stimulation have been analysed and endogenous electrical activity of the mycelium
has been ignored.

Methods
The Ganoderma resinaceum culture used in this experiment was obtained from a wild
basidiocarp found on the shores of Lago di Varese, Lombardy (Italy) in 2018, and
maintained in alternate PDA and MEA slants at MOGU S.r.l. for the last 3years at
4 ◦C under the collection code 019–18. For practical purposes, the aforementioned G.
resinaceum culture was propagated on an sterile mixed substrate of hemp shives and
soybean hulls (3:1), with a moisture content (MC) of 65% contained in plastic ﬁlter-
patch microboxes c. 17 × 17 cm2 (SacO2, Belgium). The substrates were incubated
in darkness at ambient room temperature c. 22 ◦C, until antler-shaped sporocarps
started to form on the surface c. 14 days post inoculation.
Electrical activity of a forming antler-like sporocarp was recorded using pairs
of iridium-coated stainless steel sub-dermal needle electrodes (Spes Medica S.r.l.,
Italy), with twisted cables and ADC-24 (Pico Technology, UK) high-resolution data
logger with a 24-bit A/D converter, galvanic isolation and software-selectable sam-
ple rates all contribute to a superior noise-free resolution. Each pair of electrodes
(i, i + 1), called ‘channel’, reported a potential difference pi+1 −pi between the
electrodes. The pairs of electrodes were pierced into the sporocarp as shown in
Fig.1. The channels were from the top of the antler-like sporocarp to the bottom.
Distance between electrodes was 1–2 cm. In each trial, we recorded 8 electrode pairs
simultaneously. We recorded electrical activity one sample per second. During the
1 In 1995 Olsson and Hansson demonstrated spontaneous action potential like activity in a hypha
of Pleurotus ostreatus and Armillaria bulbosa (synonymous with A. gallica and A. lutea) via intra-
cellular recording with a reference electrode in an agar substrate [27]. Our present results concern
extracellular recordings, therefore we will not compare thee with Olsson and Hansson results.

Results
Distribution of spike widths versus amplitudes is shown in Fig.2a with the majority
of spikes having amplitude less than 4 mV and width less than 41min. Distribu-
tions of frequencies of occurrences of the spike amplitudes and widths are shown in
Fig.2b and c. Most common amplitudes lie between 0.1 and 0.4 mV. The frequency
distribution of the amplitudes is well described by a power 0.047
a , where a is an ampli-
tude, shown by a solid line in Fig.2b. Most common widths of spikes are 300–500 s
(5–8 mins) as evidenced in Fig.2c.
Most common types of nontrivial electrical activity observed are singular spikes,
compound spikes, and trains of spikes. Singular spikes are shown by arrows in Fig.3a.
Compound spikes are thought to be composed of several singular spikes, or a spike
train which duration is in the range of a single spike width, so several spikes overlap,
as labelled by arrows with stars in Fig.3a. An example of the train of spikes is shown
in Fig.3a. In the ﬁrst train the average distance between spikes is 731 s and in the
second train 2300 s. There are two potential origins of the compound spikes. First,
the compound spikes could be seen as trains of spikes with a very short distance
between the spikes, i.e. trains of overlapping spikes. Second, the compound spikes

Fig. 4 Example of a long high frequency burst of spikes
could be see as a slow wave potential superimposed with a train of low amplitude
spikes.
Single spikes can form analogies of damped or growing type oscillators. The
growing type of oscillator with increasing amplitude and period of oscillations is
illustrated by four spikes in Fig.3c. The amplitude increases as 0.35, 0.84, 1.01,
1.27 mV. The width of spikes increases as 88, 210, 252, 273 s. The distance between
spikes is changing as 2253, 3739, 5372 s.
A rare but interesting feature observed is a long (up to 2h) burst of high-frequency
(a spike per 7min) spikes. An example is shown in Fig.4. The main burst is preceded
by a short (13min) burst of ﬁve spikes, shown as ‘S’ in Fig.4, and is completed by
another short (15min) burst of seven spikes. There are c. 70 spikes in the main burst:
average width of a spike is 29 s and average amplitude 0.1 mV; an average distance
spikes is 92 s.

Discussion
We found that most common width of an electrical potential spike is 5–8 min. An
average distance between electrodes in the pairs of differential electrodes was 1cm.
We speculate it takes a phase-wave, which governs the electrical potential, to prop-
agate between the electrodes 6min in average, i.e. a speed of the phase-wave is
c.0.028mm/s.Calciumwavescanpropagatewiththefastestspeedup0.03mm/s[31].
Thus we can speculate that the spikes of the electrical potential in Ganoderma
resinaceum antler-like sporocarps might relate to the fast calcium waves. The nature
of long burst of high-frequency (a spike per 7 mins) short-width (half-a-minute)
spikes is beyond speculations and could not be attributed to calcium waves.

On Electrical Spiking of Ganoderma Resinaceum
21
The width of the spike of antler-like sporocarps of Ganoderma resinaceum is
twice of the width of the spikes detected in sporocarps of Pleurotus djamor [28]
yet of the same width as spikes detected in a substrate colonised by mycelium of
Pleurotus djamor [29]. Possible explanations are the following. First, sporocarps
show higher growth rate than mycelium. Therefore, spikes detected on sporocarps
of Pleurotus djamor are twice as narrow as spikes detected on a substrate colonised
by mycelium of Pleurotus djamor. Second, Ganoderma resinaceum might have a
slower metabolism than Pleurotus djamor and therefore its spiking activity shows
wider spikes, and consequently, lower frequency of the spiking.
In the laboratory experiments we have employed a 1–2 cm distance between elec-
trodes in the pair. The distance is optimal for recording electrical impulses in slime
moulds and fungi, as have been demonstrated in [29, 32, 33]. With the increasing a
distance between active and reference electrode amplitude of spikes decrease due to
increased resistance of the shortest path between the electrodes and interference of
excitation wave-fronts originated from many disparate sources.
Recalling our initial question—“Do different species of fungi have different
parameters of their electrical spiking activity?”—we could answer “Likely, yes”.
However it would be reckless to base the answer on comparing just two species of
fungi. Therefore future research will focus on collecting statistics of spiking of wider
range of fungi species.

Electrical Spiking of Psilocybin Fungi
Antoni Gandia and Andrew Adamatzky
Abstract Psilocybin fungi, aka “magic” mushrooms, are well known for induc-
ing colourful and visionary states of mind. Such psychoactive properties and the
ease of cultivating their basidiocarps within low-tech setups make psilocybin fungi
promising pharmacological tools for mental health applications. Understanding of
the intrinsic electrical patterns occurring during the mycelial growth can be utilised
for better monitoring the physiological states and needs of these species. In this study
we aimed to shed light on this matter by characterising the extra-cellular electrical
potential of two popular species of psilocybin fungi: Psilocybe tampanensis and P.
cubensis. As in previous experiments with other common edible mushrooms, the
undisturbed fungi have shown to generate electric potential spikes and trains of spik-
ing activity. This short analysis provides a proof of intrinsic electrical communication
in psilocybin fungi, and further establishes these fungi as a valuable tool for studying
fungal electro-physiology.

Introduction
Psilocybin fungi, popularly known as “magic” mushrooms, are a group of differ-
ent species of psychoactive basidiomycetes that have gained an immense popularity
since the ethnomycologists Gordon Wasson and his wife Valentina Pavlovna Wasson
introduced them to the western audiences in 1957 [1–3]. Psilocybin fungi are remark-
ably famous for inducing mystical-type experiences thanks to tryptamine alkaloids
contained in its hyphae, mainly psilocybin, baeocystin and norbaeocystin [4, 5], to
which the community of users and a growing pool of scientiﬁc evidence grants dif-
ferent potential beneﬁts, such as treating depression to helping manage alcoholism
and drug addiction [6–11].

These organisms have been ever since surrounded of an aura of mysticism and
criticism in equal shares, with opinions mostly tied to religious or political beliefs
rather than being based in scientiﬁc research. Nevertheless, magic mushroom have
been used by different human cultures across the globe for millennia, probably since
the dawn of mankind, as a tool for exploring and healing psychological and physical
disorders, or simply to inspire awe, creativity, introspection, and a better appre-
ciation for nature [12–18]. Considering their cultural and psycho-pharmaceutical
importance, the scientiﬁc community is trying to make sense of different aspects
of their ecology, physiology, pharmacology, and overall, potential biotechnological
applications favouring human society and Earth’s biosphere.
Recent research suggests that spontaneous electrical low-frequency oscillations
(SELFOs) are found across most organisms on Earth, from bacteria to humans,
including fungi, playing an important role as electrical organisation signals that guide
the development of an organism [19]. Considering its potential function as communi-
cation and integration waves, detecting and translating SELFOs in psilocybin fungi
species may result of great utility in understanding the growth and behaviour of
these organisms, a knowledge that could be added to the toolbox of cultivation and
pharmacological optimisation techniques used by the fungal biotech industry.
Thereby, we recorded the extracellular electrical potential in mushrooms and
mycelium-colonised substrates as indicators of the fungi intrinsic activity. Action
potential-like spikes of electrical potential have been observed using intra-cellular
recording of mycelium of Neurospora crassa [20] and further conﬁrmed in intra-
cellular recordings of action potential in hyphae of Pleurotus ostreatus and Armil-
laria gallica [21] and in extra-cellular recordings of basidiocarps of and substrates
colonised by mycelium of P. ostreatus [22], Ganoderma resinaceum [23], and
Omphalotus nidiformis, Flammulina velutipes, Schizophyllum commune and Cordy-
ceps militaris [24]. While the exact nature of the travelling spikes remains uncertain
we can speculate, by drawing analogies with oscillations of electrical potential of
slime mould Physarum polycephalum [25–28], that the spikes in fungi are triggered
by calcium waves, reversing of cytoplasmic ﬂow, and translocation of nutrients and
metabolites.

Methods
Two widely distributed species of psilocybin fungi, namely Psilocybe cubensis strain
“B+” (Mondo Mycologicals BV, NL), and Psilocybe tampanensis strain “ATL#7”
(Mimosa Therapeutics BV, NL), were cultured separately on a mixture of hemp
shavings amended with 5% wheat ﬂour, at 60% moisture content, in polypropylene
(PP5) ﬁlter-patch bags.1 Electrical activity of the basidiocarps and the colonised
substrate was recorded using pairs of iridium-coated stainless steel sub-dermal
needle electrodes (Spes Medica S.r.l., Italy), with twisted cables and ADC-24
1 Experiments were conducted at Mimosa Therapeutics BV, The Netherlands.

(Pico Technology, UK) high-resolution data logger with a 24-bit analog-to-digital
converter (Fig.1). Resistance of electrodes with cables was 1. Input impedance of
Pico ADC-24 logger was 2 MOhm, ADC input bias current less than 50 nA.
We recorded electrical activity at one sample per second. During the recording,
the logger has been doing as many measurements as possible (typically up to 600s)
and saving the average value. We set the acquisition voltage range to 156 mV with an
offset accuracy of 9 µV at 1Hz to maintain a gain error of 0.1%. Each electrode pair

was considered independent with the noise-free resolution of 17 bits and conversion
time of 60 ms. Each pair of electrodes, called channels, reported a difference of the
electrical potential between the electrodes. Distance between electrodes was 1–2 cm.
We have conducted eight experiments, in each experiments we recorded electrical
activity of the fungi via four channels, i.e. 32 recordings in total.

Results
Electricalactivityrecordedfrombothspeciesofpsilocybinfungishowsarichdynam-
ics of electrical potential. Examples of the recording conducted for nearly four days
are show in Fig.1c–d. Drift of the base potential can be up to 10–15 mV however rate
of the base potential change is measured in days therefore it does affect our ability to
recognise spikes. Plots also show that in some cases the signal-to-noise ratio might
be substantially low. We omitted such cases from the spike detection pool.
We observed action-potential like spikes of electrical potential. Most expressive
spikes, see e.g. Figure2a, shown very characteristics of action potential recorded
in nervous system with distinctive depolarisation and repolarisation phases and a
refractory period. In the exemplar action-potential like spike shown in Fig.2a depo-
larisation phase is c. 18 s up to 4.5 mV; re-polarisation phase is 97 s; refractory period
is rather long c. 450 s.
In some cases, as illustrated in Fig.2b, two action-potential like spikes can occur
at so short interval that they almost merge. In this particular example, an average
spike duration is 13min, and average amplitude is 1.4 mV.
More commonly the spikes emerge in the trains of spikes. A train is a sequence of
spikes where distance between two consecutive spikes does not exceed an average
duration of a spike. Two trains of spikes are shown in Fig.2e. Also, spike can stand
alone, as shown in Fig.2d.
Amongst many types of spike classed by their duration we can select very fast
spikes, with duration of 1–2 min, and slow spikes, which width can be 15–60 min. An
example of very fast spikes directly co-existing with slow spikes is shown in Fig.2c.
In some cases, only very fast spikes can be observed during the whole duration of
the recording, see an example in Fig.2f.
A co-existence of spikes with high, 0.5–1 mV, and low, 0.1–0.3 mV, is evidenced in
the recording plotted in Fig.2g. An amplitude, however, might be not a good charac-
teristic of spikes because it only indicated how far away a wave-front of propagating
electrical activity was from a pair of differential electrodes.
Distribution of spike amplitudes version spike width is shown in Fig.3a. Pearson
correlation R = 0.0753 calculated on the distribution is technically a positive corre-
lation, however it is low value shows that the relationship between spike width and
amplitude is weak.
Distributions of spike width (Fig.3b), intervals between spikes (Fig.3c) and spike
amplitudes (Fig.3d) are not normal. This is demonstrated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test of normality. Values of Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic is 0.19467 for width dis-

Fig. 3 a Spike width versus spike amplitude distribution constructed on recording from bother
species of fungi studied. b Distribution of spike widths, c Distribution of interval between spikes.
Bin size is 500 in both distributions. d Distribution of spike amplitudes, bin size is 0.1
tribution, 0.21914 for interval distribution, and 0.28243 for amplitude distribution.
Corresponding p-values are 0.00072, 0.00016 and 0.00001.
Integrative parameters of spiking behaviour are the following (Table1). Average
duration of a spike is 70min (σ = 81min), median duration is 35min. Average
amplitude of a spike is 0.71 mV (σ = 1.06 mV), median is 0.3 mV. Average distance
between spikes is 145min (σ = 181min), median is 98min. That is average/median
distance between two spikes is a double of the average/median duration of a spike.
By the deﬁnition of the train, this means that most spikes observed are solitary spikes.
Standard deviations of spike duration and amplitude and of interval between spikes
are higher than respective average values. This indicates data are more spread out
and we should look out for distinct families of spikes.
Let us separate species and—if any—families of spikes in each species. In Psilo-
cybe tampanensis spikes are relatively uniform (Table1): average duration 104min
with σ = 69min, average distance between spikes is over three hours and median
distance equal to average. In Psilocybe cubensis we propose three families of spikes:
fast spike, up to 3min duration, slow spikes, up to 6 h duration, and very slow spikes,
up to 2 days (Table1). Fast spikes rarely form train, an average distance between
fast spikes is 17 h. An average duration of a slow spike is 3.9 h with an average

Discussion
We found that psilocybin fungi exhibit a rich spectrum of oscillations of extracellular
electrical potential. We illustrated several types of oscillations and characterised fam-
ilies of fast, slow and very slow oscillations. We demonstrated that several scales—
minutes, hours and day—of oscillators states co-exist in basidiocarps and mycelium
network of psilocybin fungi. This co-existence is similar to electrical oscillation
of a human brain, where fast oscillations might be related to responses to stimula-
tion, including endogenous stimulation by release of nutrients, and slow oscillations
might be responsible for memory consolidation [29–32]. Future research could be
concerned with decoding and understanding the spiking events to monitor growth,
development and physiological states and overall condition of the fungi both in cul-
tivation setups and natural environments. If we were able to decode spiking patterns
of fungi we would be able of ’speaking back’ to the mycelial network to manipu-
late the network’s morphology, behaviour and, potentially, enhance production of
basidiocarps and sclerotia.

Complexity of Electrical Spiking of Fungi
Mohammad Mahdi Dehshibi and Andrew Adamatzky
Abstract Oyster fungi Pleurotus djamor generate action potential like spikes of
electrical potential. The trains of spikes might manifest propagation of growing
mycelium in a substrate, transportation of nutrients and metabolites and commu-
nication processes in the mycelium network. The spiking activity of the mycelium
networks is highly variable compared to neural activity and therefore can not be
analysed by standard tools from neuroscience. We propose original techniques for
detecting and classifying the spiking activity of fungi. Using these techniques, we
analyse the information-theoretic complexity of the fungal electrical activity. The
results can pave ways for future research on sensorial fusion and decision making
by fungi.

Introduction
Excitation is an essential property of all living organisms, bacteria [1], Protists [2–4],
fungi [5] and plants [6–8] to vertebrates [9–12]. Waves of excitation could be also
found in various physical [13–16], chemical [17–19] and social systems [20, 21].
Extracellular (EC) action potential recordings have been widely used to record and
measure neural activity in organisms with excitation. When recorded with differential
electrodes, the spike manifests a propagating wave of excitation.
In our recent studies [22–24], we have shown that the Pleurotus djamor oys-
ter fungi generate action potentials like electrical potential impulses. We observed

depolarisation and refractory period, can be found in this sample spike. This spike has a length of

The depolarisation and depolarisation rates are 0.03 and 0.009 mV/s, respectively
spontaneous spike1 trains with two types of activity, i.e. high-frequency (2.6min
period) and low-frequency (14min period). However, the proper use of this informa-
tion is subject to the accurate extraction of the EC spike waveform, separating it from
the background activity of the neighbouring cells and sorting the characteristics.
The lack of an algorithmic framework for the exhaustive characterisation of the
electrical activity of the substrate colonised by mycelium of oyster fungi Pleurotus
djamor has inspired us to develop a framework to extract spike patterns, quantify the

diversity of spike events and measure the complexity of fungal electrical communi-
cation. We evidenced the spiking activity of the mycelium (see an example in Fig.1),
which will enable us to build an experimental prototype of fungi-based information
processing devices.
We evaluated the proposed framework in comparison with existing spike detec-
tion techniques in neuroscience [25, 26] and observed a signiﬁcant improvement
in the spike activity extraction. The evaluation of the proposed method for detect-
ing spike events compared to the speciﬁed spike arrival time by the expert shows
true-positive and false-positive rates of 76 and 16%, respectively. We found that the
average dominant duration of an action-potential-like spike is 402 s. The amplitude
of the spikes ranges from 0.5 to 6 mV and depends on the location of the source
of electrical activity (the position of electrodes). We have found that the complexity
of the Kolmogorov fungal spike ranges from 11 × 10−4 to 57 × 10−4. In [27], the
human brain’s Kolmogorov complexity is measured in normal, pre-ictal and ictal
states resulting in 6.01, 5.59 and 7.12 values, respectively. Although the fungi’ com-
plexity is considerably smaller than that of the human brain, its changes suggest a
degree of intra-communication in the mycelium sub-network. In fact, different parts
of the substrate transmit different information to other parts of the mycelium net-
work, where the more prolonged propagation of excitation waves leads to higher
levels of complexity.

Experimental Set-up
A wood shavings substrate was colonised by the mycelium of the grey oyster fungi,
Pleurotus ostreatus (Ann Miller’s Speciality Mushrooms Ltd, UK). The substrate
was placed in a hydroponic growing tent with a silver Mylar lightproof inner lining
(Green Box Tents, UK). Recordings were carried out in a stable indoor environment
with the temperature remaining stable at 22 ± 0.5◦and relative humidity of air 40 ±
5%. The humidity of the substrate colonised by fungi was kept at c. 70–80%. Figure2
shows examples of the experimental setups.
We inserted pairs of iridium-coated stainless steel sub-dermal needle electrodes
(Spes Medica SRL, Italy) with twisted cables into the colonised substrate for record-
ing electrical activity. Using a high-resolution ADC-24 (Pico Technology, UK) data
logger with a 24-bit A/D converter, galvanic insulation and software-selectable sam-
ple rates all lead to superior noise-free resolution. We recorded electrical activity one
sample per second, where the minimum and maximum logging times were 60.04 and
93.45h, respectively. During recording, the logger makes as many measurements as
possible (basically up to 600 per s) and saves the average value. We set the acquisi-
tion voltage range to 156 mV with an offset accuracy of 9 µV at 1Hz to preserve a
gain error of 0.1%. Each electrode pair was considered independently with a 17-bit
noise-free resolution and a 60 ms conversion time. In our experiments, electrode pairs
were placed in one of two conﬁgurations: random placement or in-line placement.

The distance between the electrodes was between 1–2 cm. In each cluster, we
recorded 5–16 pairs of electrodes (channels) simultaneously.
In six trials, we also undertook recordings of the fruit body’s resistance, where
electrodes were inserted in stalks of the bodies. We measured and logged a range of
resistances 1–1.6k using Fluke 8846A precision multimeter, where the test current
being 1 ± 0.0013 µA, once per 10s, 5 × 104 samples per trial [28]. It should be
noted that the placement of the electrodes in two experiments was in-lines with a
distance of 1cm, in two experiments it was in-lines with a distance of 2cm, and in
two experiments it was random with a distance of approximately 2cm.

Proposed Method
A spike event can be formally deﬁned as an extracellular signal that exceeds a sim-
ple amplitude threshold and passes through a corresponding pair of user-speciﬁc
time-voltage boxes. The spike, which involves depolarisation, depolarisation and
refractory cycles, represents physiological and morphological processes in mycelial
networks. To extract spike events, we proposed an unsupervised approach consisting
of three major steps. The pipeline of the proposed approach is shown in Fig.3
—Step 1: We split the entire recording duration (F(t)) into k chunks ( fk(t)) with
respect to the signal transitions. In order to evaluate the transitions, we determined
the state level of the signal by its histogram and identiﬁed all regions that cross the
upper boundary of the low state and the lower boundary of the high state. Then, we

Fig. 3 The pipeline for the identiﬁcation of spike events
measure scale-to-frequency conversions of the analytic signal in each chunk using
Morse wavelet basis [29]. To assess the existence of spike-like events, we scaled
the wavelet coefﬁcients at each frequency and obtained the sum of the scales below
the threshold speciﬁed in Algorithm 6. Finally, we selected regions of interest (ROI)
enclosed between a consecutive local minimum and a maximum of more than 30 sec.
—Step 2: We used spline interpolation to measure the analytic signal envelopes
around local maximum values. To determine the analytical signal, we ﬁrst applied
the discrete approximation of Laplace’s differential operator to fk(t) to obtain a
ﬁnite sequence of equally-spaced samples. Then, we applied discrete-time Fourier
transform to this ﬁnite sequence. From the average signal envelope, we extracted
regions spanning between a consecutive local minimum and a maximum. These
regions created constraints that contributed to the identiﬁcation of spike events.
—Step 3: We retained the ROIs extracted in the ﬁrst step, which met the constraints
of the second step. The signal envelope could direct wavelet decomposition in an
unsupervised manner in order to cluster the signal into the spike, pseudo-spike, and
background activity of the adjacent cells. In the following sub-sections, we detailed
the proposed process.
3.1
Slicing Fungi Electrical Activity
To split the electrical activity of fungi (F(t)) with a duration of (t) second into (k)
chunks ( f k(t), 1 ≤k ≤t −1), we used the signal transitions that constitute each
pulse. To determine the transitions, we estimated the state level of F(t) using the
histogram method [30]. Then, we identiﬁed all regions that cross the upper boundary
of the low state and the lower boundary of the high state. We followed the following
steps to estimate the signal states:

(1) Determine the minimum, maximum and range of amplitudes.
(2) Sort the amplitude values in the histogram bins and determine the width of the
bin by dividing the amplitude range by the number of bins.
(3) Identify the lowest- and highest-indexed histogram bins, hblow, hbhigh, with
non-zero counts.
(4) Divide the histogram into two sub-histograms, where the indices of the lower
and upper histogram bins are hblow ≤hb ≤1
2(hbhigh −hblow) and hblow +
1
2(hbhigh −hblow) ≤hb ≤hbhigh, respectively.
(5) Calculate the mean of the lower and upper histogram to compute the state levels.
Each chunk is then enclosed between the last negative-going transitions of each
positive-polarity pulse and the next positive-going transition. Figure4 shows the
slicing results of two channels.
3.2
Detecting Time-Localised Events by Morse-based
Wavelets
The electrical activity of mycelium shows modulated behaviour with changes in
amplitude and frequency over time. This feature suggests that the signal can be
analysed with analytic wavelets, which are naturally grouped into pairs of even or
cosine-like and odd or sine-like pairs, allowing them to capture phase variability.
A wavelet (ψ(t)) is a ﬁnite energy function that projects f (t) to a family of time-
scale waveforms through translation and scaling. The Morse wavelet (ψβ,γ(t)) is
an analytical wavelet whose Fourier transform is supported only on a positive real
axis [29, 31]. This wavelet is deﬁned in the frequency domain using Eq.1.

The representation of Morse wavelets would be more oscillatory when both β and
γ increase, and more localised with impulses when these parameters decrease. On the
other hand, increasing β and holding γ ﬁxed expand the central portion of the wavelet
and increase the long-term rate of decay. Whereas, increasing γ by keeping β constant
extends the wavelet envelope without affecting the long-term decay rate. Inspired
by [32], we set the symmetry parameter γ to 3 and the time-bandwidth product
P2 = βγ to 60. We have used L1 normalisation to provide the same magnitude
in wavelets when we have the same amplitude oscillatory components at different
scales.
Figure5 displays two randomly chosen 3000-second chunks of fungi electri-
cal activity (namely Slice1 and Slice2) with their Morse wavelet scalograms. We
observed that the use of the maximum absolute value at each frequency (level) to
normalise coefﬁcients may help to identify events that may involve spikes. We then
used Eq.3 to normalise coefﬁcients and set zero entries to 1.

found that the analysis of the analytic signal by its envelope could improve the
accuracy of the spike detection.
3.3
Analytical Signal Envelope for Locating Spike Pattern
We calculated the magnitude of the analytic signal to obtain the signal envelope (ξ).
The analytic signal is detected using the discrete Fourier Transform as implemented
in the Hilbert Transform. In order to highlight effective signal peaks and neutralise
inﬂection regions, the second numerical signal derivation (L = ∂2 f/4∂t2) was cal-
culated. A frequency-domain approach is proposed in [33] to approximately generate
a discrete-time analytic signal. In this approach, the negative frequency in half of
each spectral period is set to 0, resulting in a periodic one-sided spectrum. The pro-

Obtaining an analytic signal in this way satisﬁes two properties: (1) The real part is
equivalent to the original discrete-time sequence; (2) the real and imaginary com-
ponents are orthogonal. Calculating the magnitude of the analytic signal using Eq.6
results in the signal envelope (ξ[n]) containing the upper (ξH[n]) and lower (ξL[n])
envelopes of L[n].
ξ[n] = |z[n]|
(6)
Envelopes are calculated using spline interpolation over a local maximum sepa-
rated by at least n p = 60 samples. We considered n p = 60 because, in our previous
studies [22, 23], we did not observe any electrical potential of spikes shorter than 60s.
Algorithm Fig.10 was proposed to locate candidate regions using a signal envelope.
Figure11a, d shows the candidate regions in R before applying Step 13. At this
step, while R includes regions that do not align with the spike deﬁnition (pointed
by arrow in the plot), the correctly identiﬁed spikes are consistent with our ﬁndings
in [22, 34]. Steps 13 and 14 were used to remove non-spike regions marked in
red in Fig.11b, e. However, the output of Algorithm Fig.10 (see Fig.11c, f) still
includes regions belonging to either pseudo-spike/inﬂection regions or refractory
periods attached to pseudo-spike regions.
To ﬁx mis-identiﬁed ROIs in Algorithms Figs.8 and 10, we proposed Algorithm
Fig.12 in which regions in (C ∪D) are used to update R. Indeed, if the ROI in R is
a subset of (C ∪D), we add it to the spike event set (Fs) and update the spike length.
If the ROI in (C ∪D) is a subset of R, we add it to the pseudo-spike set (Fp). In the
case of an intersection that does not meet the subset requirement, we concatenate
ROIs and divide the new region from the intersection point into two segments. Then,
we add the segment with the minimum length to Fp. Finally, regions with a length
of less than 60s are excluded from both Fs and Fp. The results are shown in Fig.13.

pared the proposed method with the expert opinion on the location of spikes. In the
complexity analysis, we selected the complexity measures used in previous studies
[35–41] to quantify spatio-temporal activity patterns.
4.1
Objective Analysis
Various methods have been proposed for detecting and sorting spike events in EC
recordings [25, 42–51]. However, only a few of these methods do not require addi-
tional details, such as template construction and the supervised setting of thresholds
for detecting and sorting spike events [25, 26]. Nenadic and Burdick [25] have
developed an unsupervised method for detecting and locating spikes in noisy neural
recordings.Thisapproachbeneﬁtsfromthecontinuoustransformationofthewavelet.
They applied multi-scale signal decomposition using the ‘bior1.3,’ ‘bior1.5,’ ‘Haar,’
or ‘db2’ wavelet basis. To determine the presence of spikes, they separated the signal
and noise at each scale and performed Bayesian hypothesis testing. Finally, they

Fig. 14 Results of applying proposed algorithms in [25, 26] to a Slice1 and b Slice2. Note that
the wavelet-based method can only locate spike arrival time. The kernel bandwidth optimisation
can, however, extract the spike region
combined decisions on different scales to estimate the arrival times of individual
spikes.
Shimazaki and Shinomoto [26] proposed an optimisation technique for the timing-
histogram bin width selection. This optimisation minimised the mean integrated
square in the kernel density estimation. This method beneﬁts from variable kernel
width, which allowed grasping non-stationary phenomena. Also, this method used
stiffness constant to avoid possible overﬁtting due to excessive freedom in the band-
width variability. The calculated bandwidth was then used as a proxy for ﬁltering
spike event regions. Figure14 shows the results of applying these methods to two
chunks with a length of 3000s.
Both compete methods could not correctly detect all spike events that were located
by the expert. The wavelet-based method could locate three spikes in Fig.14b without
detecting any spike in Fig.14a. The adaptive bandwidth kernel-based method could
detect one spike in Fig.14b and one pseudo-spike in Figs.14a, b. While our proposed
method misidentiﬁed one spike event in Fig.13a and three spikes in Fig.13b.
We also compared the proposed method with the expert opinion on a randomly
selected 36,000s chunk, i.e., 10h of electrical activity recordings. In this quantitative
comparison, the proposed approach could correctly locate 21 spikes and four pseudo-
spike events. Our method also overestimated two refractory periods, resulting in the
true-positive and false-positive rates of 76 and 16%, respectively. Figure15a shows
located spikes by the expert, and Fig.15b demonstrates the results of the proposed
spike detection method.
We applied the proposed method to six experiments where the statistical results
are shown in Figs.16 and 17 and summarised in Table1. It should be noted that the
placement of the electrodes in two experiments was in lines with a distance of 1cm, in
two experiments it was in lines with a distance of 2cm, and in two experiments it was
random with a distance of approximately 2cm. The proposed method is implemented

These results are consistent with the experiments carried out on the electrical
activity of Physarum polycephalum [34, 53] where it has been reported that the
length of the Physarum spike is between 60 and 120s. Physarum is faster than fungi
in terms of growth. Now, with further observations, we can hypothesise that the
length of the fungal spikes cannot be less than 60s.

Complexity Analysis
Toquantifythecomplexityoftheelectricalsignallingrecorded,weusedthefollowing
measurements:
(1) TheShannonentropy (H)iscalculatedas H = −
w∈W(ν(w)/η · ln(ν(w)/η)),
where ν(w) is a number of times the neighbourhood conﬁguration w is found in
conﬁguration W, and η is the total number of spike events found in all channels
of the experiment.
(2) Simpson’s diversity (S) is calculated as S = 
w∈W(ν(w)/η)2. It linearly corre-
lates with Shannon entropy for H < 3 and the relationship becomes logarithmic
for higher values of H. The value of S ranges between 0 and 1, where 1 represents
inﬁnite diversity and 0, no diversity.
(3) Space ﬁlling (D) is the ratio of non-zero entries in W to the total length of string.
(4) Expressiveness (E) is calculated as the Shannon entropy H divided by space-
ﬁlling ratio D, where it reﬂects the ‘economy of diversity’.
(5) Lempel–Ziv complexity (L Z) is used to assess temporal signal diversity, i.e.,
compressibility. Here, we represented the spiking activity of mycelium with a
binary string where ‘1s’ indicates the presence of a spike and ‘0s’ otherwise.
Formally, as both the barcode and the channels’ electrical activity are stored as

Complexity of Electrical Spiking of Fungi
51
PNG images, LZ is the ratio of the barcode image size to the size of the electrical
activity image (see Figs.18 and 19).
(6) Perturbation complexity index PC I = L Z/H.
To calculate Lempel–Ziv complexity, we saved each signal as a PNG image (see
two examples in Fig.19), where the ‘deﬂation’ algorithm used in PNG lossless com-
pression [54–56] is a variation of the classical LZ77 algorithm [57]. We employed
this approach as the recorded signal is a non-binary string. We take the largest PNG
ﬁle size to normalise this measurement.
In order to assess signal diversity across all channels and observations, each exper-
iment was represented by a binary matrix with a row for each channel and a column
for each observation. This binary matrix is then concatenated by observation to form a
single binary string. We used Kolmogorov complexity algorithm [58] to measure the
Lempel–Ziv complexity (L Zc) across channels. L Zc captures both temporal diver-
sity on a single channel and spatial diversity across channels. We also normalised
L Zc by dividing the raw value by the randomly shufﬂed value obtained for the same
binary input sequence. Since the value of L Z for a ﬁxed-length binary sequence is
maximum if the sequence is absolutely random, the normalised values represent the
degree of signal diversity on a scale from 0 to 1. The results of the calculation of
these complexity measurements for all six conﬁgurations are shown in Fig.20 and
summarised in Table2.
We calculated the aforementioned complexity criteria for three forms of writing
to illustrate the communication complexity of the mycelium substrate, including (1)
news items,3 (2) random alphanumeric sequences4 and (3) periodic alphanumeric
sequences encoded with Huffman code [59], see barcode in Fig.21. Table3 presents
the results of the comparison. We also considered two podcasts in English (387s)
and Chinese (385s) to compare the complexity of fungal spiking with human speech.
Both podcasts were in MP3 format at a sampling rate of 44100Hz. We randomly
selected two chunks from two electrical activity channels with a duration of 388 and
342s to compare with the English and Chinese podcasts, respectively. We observed
that, in both cases, the Kolmogorov complexity of the fungal is lower than the human
speech, implying the fact that the amount of information transmitted by the fungi is
less than the human voice. From a technical point of view, we computed the DC level
of each signal and binarised the signal with respect to that level [60]. To binaries the
signal, we set the inputs with values less than or equal to the DC level to 0 and the
rest of the inputs to 1. The ﬁndings are shown in Fig.22.

Discussion
We developed algorithmic framework for exhaustive characterisation of electrical
activity of a substrate colonised by mycelium of oyster fungi Pleurotus djamor. We
evidenced spiking activity of the mycelium. We found that average dominant duration
of an action-potential like spike is 402 sec. The spikes amplitudes’ depends on the
location of the source of electrical activity related to the position of electrodes, thus

This is indeed low compared to 50–60 mV of intracellular recording, nevertheless
understandable due to the fact the electrodes are inserted not even in mycelium
strands but in the substrate colonised by mycelium. The shift of the distribution to
higher values of spike amplitude in experiments with a distance of 2cm between the
electrodes might indicate that the width of the propagation of the excitation wave
front exceeds 1cm and might even be close to 2cm.
The spiking events have been characterised with several complexity measures.
Most measures, apart of Kolmogorov complexity shown a low degree of variability
between channels (different sites of the recordings). The Kolmogorov complexity of
fungal spiking varies from 11×10−4 to 57×10−4. This might indicated mycelium
sub-networks in different parts of the substrate have been transmitting different infor-
mation to other parts of the mycelium network. This is somehow echoes experimen-
tal results on communication between ants analysed with Kolmogorov complexity:
longer paths communicated ants corresponds to higher values of complexity [61].
LZ complexity of fungal language (Table2) is much higher than of news, random
or periodic sequences (Table3). The same can be observed for Shannon entropy.
Kolmogorov complexity of the fungal language is much lower than that of news
sampler or random or periodic sequences. Complexity of European languages based
on their compressibility [62] is shown in Fig.23, French having lowest LZ complexity
0.66 and Finnish highest LZ complexity 0.79. Fungal language of electrical activity
has minimum LZ complexity 0.61 and maximum 0.91 (media 0.85, average 0.83).
Thus, we can speculate that a complexity of fungal language is higher than that of
human languages (at least for European languages).

Fungi Anaesthesia
Andrew Adamatzky and Antoni Gandia
Abstract Electrical activity of fungus Pleurotus ostreatus is characterised by slow
(hours) irregular waves of baseline potential drift and fast (minutes) action potential
likes spikes of the electrical potential. An exposure of the mycelium colonised sub-
strate to a chloroform vapour lead to several fold decrease of the baseline potential
waves and increase of their duration. The chloroform vapour also causes either com-
plete cessation of spiking activity or substantial reduction of the spiking frequency.
Removal of the chloroform vapour from the growth containers leads to a gradual
restoration of the mycelium electrical activity.

Introduction
Most living cells are sensitive to anaesthetics [1–3]. First experiments on anaesthesia
of plants have be done by Claude Bernard in late 1800s [4]. Later experiments on
amoeba [5] shown that weak concentration of narcotics causes the amoebae to spread
out and propagate in a spread condition while narcotic concentrations led to cessation
of movements. During last century the experimental evidences mounted up including
anaesthesia of yeasts [1], various aquatic invertebrates [6], plants [3, 7], protists [8],
bronchial ciliated cells [9]. A general consensus now is that any living substrate can
be anaesthetised [3]. The question remains, however, how exactly species without a
nervous system would respond to exposure to anaesthetics.
In present chapter we focus on fungi anaesthesia. Why fungi? Fungi are the largest,
most widely distributed, and oldest group of living organisms [10]. Smallest fungi are
microscopic single cells. The largest (15 hectares) mycelium belongs to Armillaria
gallica (synonymous with A. bulbosa, A. inﬂata, and A. lutea) [11] and the largest
fruit body belongs to Phellinus ellipsoideus (formerly Fomitiporia ellipsoidea) which
weighs half-a-ton [12].

A. Adamatzky and A. Gandia
Fungi exhibit a high degree of protocognitive abilities. For example, they are
capable for efﬁcient exploration of conﬁned spaces [13–17]. Moreover, optimisation
of the mycelial network [18] is similar to that of the slime mould Physarum poly-
cephalum [19] and transport networks [20]. Therefore, we can speculate that the fungi
can solve the same range of computational problems as P. polycephalum [21], includ-
ing shortest path [22–26], Voronoi diagram [27], Delaunay triangulation, proximity
graphs and spanning tree, concave hull and, possibly, convex hull, and, with some
experimental efforts, travelling salesman problem [28]. The fungi’s protocognitive
abilities and computational potential make them fruitful substrates for anaesthesia
because they might show us how non-neuron awareness is changing under effects of
narcotics.
We use extracellular electrical potential of mycelium as indicator of the fungi
activity. Action potential-like spikes of electrical potential have been discovered
using intra-cellular recording of mycelium of Neurospora crassa [29] and further
conﬁrmed in intra-cellular recordings of action potential in hyphae of Pleurotus
ostreatus and A. gallica [30] and in extra-cellular recordings of fruit bodies of and
substrates colonized by mycelium of P. ostreatus [31]. While the exact nature of
the travelling spikes remains uncertain we can speculate, by drawing analogies with
oscillations of electrical potential of slime mould Physarum polycephalum [32–
35], that the spikes in fungi are triggered by calcium waves, reversing of cytoplas-
mic ﬂow, translocation of nutrients and metabolites. Studies of electrical activity of
higher plants can brings us even more clues. Thus, the plants use the electrical spikes
for a long-distance communication aimed to coordinate the activity of their bodies
[36–38]. The spikes of electrical potential in plants relate to a motor activity [39–42],
responses to changes in temperature [43], osmotic environment [44], and mechanical
stimulation [45, 46].

Methods
A commercial strain of the fungus Pleurotus ostreatus (collection code 21–18, Mogu
S.r.l., Italy), previously selected for its superior ﬁtness growing on the targeted sub-
strate, was cultured on sterilised hemp shives contained in plastic (PP5) ﬁlter patch
microboxes (SacO2, Belgium) that were kept in darkness at ambient room tempera-
ture c. 22 ◦C. After one week of incubation, a hemp brick well colonised by the fun-
gus was manually crumbled and spread on rectangular fragments, c. 12 × 12 cm2,
of moisturised non-woven hemp pads. When these fragments were colonised, as
visualised by white and healthy mycelial growth on surface, they were used for
experiments.
Electrical activity of the colonised hemp pads was recorded using pairs of iridium-
coated stainless steel sub-dermal needle electrodes (Spes Medica S.r.l., Italy), with
twisted cables and ADC-24 (Pico Technology, UK) high-resolution data logger with
a 24-bit A/D converter. To keep electrodes stable we have been placing a polyurethane

in the grow tent
pad under the fabric. The electrodes were arranged in a line (Fig.1a, b). The pairs of
electrodes were pierced through the fabric and into the polyurethane pad.
The fungal substrates pierced with electrodes was placed into 20cm by 10cm by
10cm plastic boxes with tight lids.
We recorded electrical activity at one sample per second. During the recording,
the logger has been doing as many measurements as possible (typically up to 600
per second) and saving the average value. We set the acquisition voltage range to
156 mV with an offset accuracy of 9 µV at 1Hz to maintain a gain error of 0.1%.
Each electrode pair was considered independent with the noise-free resolution of 17
bits and conversion time of 60 ms. Each pair of electrodes, called channels, reported
a difference of the electrical potential between the electrodes. Distance between
electrodes was 1–2 cm. In each trial, we recorded eight electrode pairs, channels,
simultaneously.
To study the effect of chloroform we soaked a piece of ﬁlter paper c. 4cm by 4cm
in chloroform (Sigma Aldrich, analytical standard) and placed the piece of paper
inside the plastic container with the recorded fungal substrate.

The humidity of the fungal colonies was 70–80% (MerlinLaser Protimeter, UK).
The experiments were conducted in a room with ambient temperature 21 ◦C and in
the darkness of protective growing tents (Fig.1c).
We have conducted ten experiments, in each experiments we recorded electrical
activity of the fungi via eight channels, i.e. 80 recordings in total.

Results
Mycelium colonised hemp pad exhibit patterns of electrical activity similar to that of
spiking neural tissue. Examples of action potential like spikes, solitary and in trains,
are shown in Fig.2.
Application of the chloroform to the container with fungi substantially affected
the electrical activity of the fungi. An example of an extreme, i.e. where almost all
electrical activity of mycelium seized, response is shown in Fig.3. In this example,
the introduction of the chloroform leads to the suppression of the spiking activity
and reduction of deviation in values of the electrical potential differences recorded
on the channels.
The intact mycelium composite shows median amplitude of the irregular move-
ments of the baseline potential is 0.45 mV (average 0.64 mV, σ = 0.64), median
duration 29850 s (average 67507 s, σ = 29850). After exposure to chloroform the
baseline potential movements show median amplitude reduced to 0.16 mV (average
0.18 mV, σ = 0.12) and median duration increased to 38507 s (average 38114 s,
σ = 38507). For the eight channels (pairs of differential electrodes) recorded expo-
sure to chloroform led to nearly three times decrease in amplitude of the drifts of
baseline potential and nearly 1.3 increase in duration of the drifts. Before exposure to
chloroform the mycelium composite produced fast (i.e. less than 10–20 mins) spikes.
Median amplitude of the spikes was 0.48 mV (average 0.52 mV, σ = 0.2). Median
duration of spikes was 62 s (average 63 s, σ = 18), median distance between the

composite did not show any spiking activity above level of background noise, which
was for this particular recording c. 0.05 mV.
In some cases the spiking activity is diminished gradually with decreased fre-
quency and lowered amplitude, as exempliﬁed in Fig.4. Typically, the intact spiking
frequency is a spike per 70min while after inhalation of chloroform a spike per
254min in the ﬁrst 40–50 h and decreased to nearly zero after. The median ampli-
tude of intact mycelium spikes is 0.51 mV, average 0.74 mV (σ = 0.59). Anaes-
thetised mycelium shows, spikes with median amplitude 0.11 mV, average 0.2 mV
(σ = 0.2). Spikes are not distributed uniformly but gathered in trains of spikes. In
the intact mycelium there is a media of 3 spikes in the train, average number of

stimulation with chloroform vapour. Arrow labelled ‘ON’ shows moment when a source of chlo-
roform vapour was added was added into the enclosure, ‘OFF’ when the source of chloroform was
removed. The spiking activity of the mycelium recovering from anaesthesia is zoomed in
spikes is 4.2 (σ = 4.4). Median duration of a spike train is 84min, average 112min
(σ = 32). Media interval between trains is 53min, average 55 s (σ = 29). Anaes-
thetised mycelium emits trains with median number of 2 spikes, average 2.5 spikes,
average 2.5 spikes (σ = 0.84). A median duration of such trains is 29min, average
51min (σ = 22). The trains appear much more rarely than the trains in the intact
mycelium: median interval between trains is 227min.
In all ten but one experiment the container remained closed for over two-three
days. By that time all kinds of electrical activity in mycelium bound substrate extin-
guished and the mycelium never recovered to a functional state. In experiment illus-
trated in Fig.5 we removed a source of chloroform after 16h and kept the con-
tainer open and well ventilated for an hour to remove any traces of chloroform from
the air. The intact mycelium shows median frequency of spiking as one spike per
27min, average 24min. Median amplitude of the spikes is 3.4 mV, average 3.25 mV
(σ = 1.45). The anaesthetised mycelium demonstrates electrical spiking activity
reduced in amplitude: median amplitude of spikes is 0.24 mV, average 0.32 mV
(σ = 0.2), and low frequency of spiking: median distance between spikes is 38min,
average 40min. Electrical activity of the mycelium restores to above noise level
c. 60h after the source of the chloroform is removed from the enclosure (insert in
Fig.5). Frequency of spikes is one spike per 82min (median), average 88min. The
amplitudes of recovering spikes are 0.96 mV in median (average 0.93 mV, σ = 0.08)
which are three times less than of the spikes in the mycelium before the narcosis but
nearly ﬁve times higher than of the spike of the anaesthetised mycelium.

Discussion
We demonstrated that the electrical activity of the fungus Pleurotus ostreatus is a
reliable indicator of the fungi anaesthesia. When exposed to a chloroform vapour
the mycelium reduces frequency and amplitude of its spiking and, in most cases,
cease to produce any electrical activity exceeding the noise level (Table1a). When
the chloroform vapour is eliminated from the mycelium enclosure the mycelium
electrical activity restores to a level similar to that before anaesthesia (Table1b).
The fungal responses to chloroform are similar to that recorded by us with slime
mould Physarum polycephalum (unpublished results). A small concentration of
anaesthetic leads to reduced frequency and amplitude of electrical potential oscil-
lation spikes of the slime mould, and some irregularity of the electrical potential
spikes (Fig.6a). Large amounts of anaesthetic causes the electrical activity to cease
completely and never recover (Fig.6b).
With regards to directions of future research, as far as we are aware, the present
paperistheﬁrstintheﬁeld,andthereforeitratherinitiatestheresearchthanbringsany
closure or conclusions. We know that anaesthetics block electrical activity of fungi
(as well as slime moulds) however we do not know exact biophysical mechanisms
of these actions. The study of biophysics and molecular biology of fungi anaesthesia
could be a scope for future research. Another direction of studies could be the analysis
of the decision making abilities of fungi under the inﬂuence of anaesthetics. An
experiment could be constructed when fungal hyphae are searching for an optimal
path in a labyrinth when subjected to increasing doses of chloroform vapour. There
may be an opportunity to make a mapping from concentrations of anaesthetic to
geometry of the mycelium search path.

Living Mycelium Composites Discern
Weights via Patterns of the Electrical
Activity
Andrew Adamatzky and Antoni Gandia
Abstract Fungal construction materials—substrates colonised by mycelium—are
getting increased recognition as viable ecologically friendly alternatives to conven-
tional building materials. A functionality of the constructions made from fungal
materials would be enriched if blocks with living mycelium, known for their ability
to respond to chemical, optical and tactile stimuli, were inserted. We investigated
how large blocks of substrates colonised with mycelium of Ganoderma resinaceum
responded to stimulation with heavy weights. We analysed details of the electrical
responses to the stimulation with weights and show that ON and OFF stimuli can
be discriminated by the living mycelium composites and that a habituation to the
stimulation occurs. Novelty of the results in the reporting on changes in electrical
spiking activity of mycelium bound composites in response to a heavy loads.

Introduction
Current practices in the construction industry make a substantial contribution to
global climate change with potential damages to natural environment, natural
resources supplies, agriculture, and human health [1–3]. Therefore recyclable bio-
materials are emerging as potential key players in the alternative construction indus-
try [4–6]. Materials produced from and with fungi are amongst most promising
candidates.
Mycelium bound composites—masses of organic substrates colonised by fungi—
are considered to be future environmentally sustainable growing biomaterials
[7–9]. The fungal materials are used in acoustic insulation panels [10–12], thermal
insulation wall cladding [13–18], packaging materials [19–21] and wearables [7,
22–25].

In [26] we proposed to develop a structural substrate by using live fungal
mycelium, functionalise the substrate with nanoparticles and polymers to make
mycelium-based electronics [27–29], implement sensorial fusion and decision mak-
ing in the mycelium networks [30]. The structural substrate—the mycelium bound
composites—will be used to grow monolithic buildings from the functionalised fun-
gal substrate [31]. Fungal buildings would self-grow, build, and repair themselves
subject to substrate supplied, use natural adaptation to the environment, sense all that
humans can sense. Whilst major parts of a building will be made from dried and cured
mycelium composites there is an opportunity to use blocks with living mycelium as
embedded sensorial elements. On our venture to investigate sensing properties of
the mycelium composite blocks, called ‘fungal blocks’ further, we decided to study
how large fungal blocks respond to pressure via changes in their electrical activity.
The electrical activity have been chosen as indicator because fungi are known to
respond to chemical and physical stimuli by changing patterns of their electrical
activity [32–34] and electrical properties [29].

Methods and Materials
Mycelium bound composites have been prepared as follows. A pre-selected strain
of the ﬁlamentous polypore fungus Ganoderma resinaceum (stock culture #19-18,
Mogu S.r.l., Italy) was cultured on a block shaped substrate based of hemp shives
and soybean hulls (mixture ratio 3:1, moisture content 65%) in plastic ﬁlter-patch
microboxes in total darkness and at ambient room temperature c. 22 ◦C. After 7 days
of incubation, the colonised substrate produced living blocks c. 20×20×10 cm that
were immediately used for the experiments.
Electrical activity of the colonised fungal blocks was recorded using pairs of
iridium-coatedstainlesssteelsub-dermalneedleelectrodes(SpesMedicaS.r.l.,Italy),
with twisted cables and ADC-24 (Pico Technology, UK) high-resolution data logger
with a 24-bit A/D converter, galvanic isolation and software-selectable sample rates
all contribute to a superior noise-free resolution. An overall scheme of recording
is shown in Fig.1a. The pairs of electrodes were pierced, 5 mm deep, into sides
of the blocks as shown in Fig.1bc, two pairs per side. Distance between electrodes
was 1–2 cm. In each trial, we recorded 8 electrode pairs, channels, simultaneously.
We recorded electrical activity one sample per second. During the recording, the
logger has been doing as many measurements as possible (typically up to 600 per
second) and saving the average value. The humidity of the fungal blocks was 70–80%
(MerlinLaser Protimeter, UK). The experiments were conducted in a growing tent
with constant ambient temperature at 21 ◦C in absence of light.
We stimulated the fungal blocks by placing a 8 and 16 kg cast iron weights on the
tops of the blocks (Fig.1d). The surface of the fungal blocks was insulated from the
cast iron weight by a polyethylene ﬁlm.

Results and Discussion
An example of fungal block’s electrical responses to 8 kg load is shown in Fig.2a.
The responses are characterised by an immediate response, i.e. occurring in 10–
20 min of the stimulation, and a delayed, in 1–4 h after beginning of the stimulation,
response. The immediate responses were manifested in spikes of electrical potential
recorded on the electrodes. Average amplitude of an immediate response to the
loading with 8 kg was 3.05 mV, σ = 2.5 and the spikes’ average duration 489 s,
σ = 273. Average amplitude of the immediate response to lifting the weight was
4 mV, σ = 4.4 and average duration of 217 s, σ = 232. Delayed responses were

decreases and stays in the interval [−0.0015, 0.0015] mV.
Fungal blocks shown responses, with patterns of electrical activity different in
amplitude and frequency of oscillations from that observed in the non-stimulated
blocks, to the 8 kg loads only for 1–2 cycles of loading and unloading, no signiﬁcant
responses to further cycles of the stimulation have been observed. The fungal blocks
responded to stimulation with 16 kg weight for at least 8 cycles of loading and
unloading. Let us discuss these responses in details.
An example of electrical activity recorded on 8 channels, during the stimulation
with 16 kg weight, is shown in Fig.2b. Distributions of ‘spikes amplitudes versus

lifting of the weight (OFF spikes) are shown in Fig.4. In response to application
of 16 kg weight the fungal blocks produced spikes with median amplitude 1.4 mV
and median duration 456 s; average amplitude of ON spikes was 2.9 mV, σ = 4.9
and average duration 880 s, σ = 1379. OFF spikes were characterised by median
amplitude 1 mV and median duration 216 s; average amplitude 2.1 mV, σ = 4.6, and
average duration 453 s, σ = 559. ON spikes are 1.4 higher than and twice as longer
as OFF spikes. Based on this comparison of the response spikes we can claim that
fungal blocks recognise when a weight was applied or removed.
Would living fungal materials habituate to the stimulation with weights? Yes, as
evidenced in Fig.5. Amplitudes of ON and OFF spikes decline with iterations of
stimulation as shown in Fig.5a. The duration of spikes also decreases, in overall,
with iterations of stimulation, Fig.5b, albeit not monotonously.
As previously demonstrated in [32–34] mycelium networks exhibit action-
potential like spikes. An example of spiking activity recorded in present experiments
is shown in Fig.6, where spikes are shown by arrows. The plot demonstrates an extent
of the variability of the spike in amplitude and duration. The spikes have an average
amplitude of 0.02 mV, σ = 0.01. The amplitudes of spikes depend on a distance of
an excitation wave-front from the electrodes and therefore will be ignored here, and
we will focus only on frequencies of spiking. We found that median frequency of
spiking of the non-stimulated fungal blocks is
1
702 Hz while the fungal blocks loaded
with the weights spike with a median frequency
1
958 Hz. Average spiking frequency
of the unloaded fungal blocks is
1
793 Hz and of the loaded blocks
1
1031 Hz. Thus, we
can speculate that fungal blocks loaded with weights spike 1.4 times more frequently
than unloaded blocks.
Let us overview the ﬁndings presented. We applied heavy weights to large blocks
of mycelium bound composites, fungal blocks, and recorded electrical activity of the
fungal blocks. We found that the fungal block respond to application and removal of

Fig. 6 Example of spiking activity of living mycelium composite. The spikes of electrical potential
are shown by arrows
the weights with spikes of electrical potential. The results complement our studies
on tactile stimulation of fungal skin (mycelium sheet with no substrate) [35]: the
fungal skin responds to application and removal of pressure with spikes of electrical
potential. The fungal blocks can discern whether a weight was applied or removed
because the blocks react to application of the weights with higher amplitude and
longer duration spikes than the spikes responding to the removal of the weights.
The fungal responses to stimulation show habituation. This is in accordance with
previous studies on stimulation of plants, fungi, bacteria, and protists [36–40]. An
additional ﬁnding was that loading of the fungal blocks with weights increase fre-
quency of electrical potential spiking. This increase in the spiking frequency might
be due to physiological responses to a mild mechanical damage caused by heavy
loads; the responses involve calcium waves and lead to regeneration processes and
sprouting [41].
Further studies in stimulation of living mycelium bound composites with weights
could focus on studying whether shapes of the weights could be recognised by
mycelium networks. A possible scenario would be to map a set of basic shapes into
sets of electrical responses recorded on pairs of differential electrodes inserted into
sides of the fungal blocks. Another promising direction of the research will be to
study electrical responses of the fungal blocks to changes in ambient temperature.

Conclusion
Live mycelium composites exhibit a range of electrical activity. The patterns of their
electrical activity change when a pressure (in the form of a weight) is applied to
the composites. Whilst it is still unknown if the composites can accurately reﬂect
an amount of pressure developed via their electrical activity patterns, it is proved
that they can act as ON/OFF sensors. The ﬁndings open new horizons into reactive
biomaterials.

Fungal Sensing Skin
Andrew Adamatzky, Antoni Gandia, and Alessandro Chiolerio
Abstract A fungal skin is a thin ﬂexible sheet of a living homogeneous mycelium
made by a ﬁlamentous fungus. The skin could be used in future living architectures of
adaptive buildings and as a sensing living skin for soft self-growing/adaptive robots.
In experimental laboratory studies we demonstrate that the fungal skin is capable
for recognising mechanical and optical stimulation. The skin reacts differently to
loading of a weight, removal of the weight, and switching illumination on and off.
These are the ﬁrst experimental evidences that fungal materials can be used not only
as mechanical ‘skeletons’ in architecture and robotics but also as intelligent skins
capable for recognition of external stimuli and sensorial fusion.

Background
Flexible electronics, especially electronic skins [1–3] is amongst the most rapidly
growing and promising ﬁelds of novel and emergent hardware. The electronic skins
are made of ﬂexible materials where electronics capable of tactile sensing [4–7] are
embedded.Theelectronicskinsarecapableoflowlevelperception[8, 9]andcouldbe
developed as autonomous adaptive devices [10]. Typical designs of electronic skins
include thin-ﬁlm transistor and pressure sensors integrated in a plastic substrate [11],
micro-patterned polydimethylsiloxane with carbon nanotube ultra-thin ﬁlms [12,
13], a large-area ﬁlm synthesised by sulfurisation of a tungsten ﬁlm [14], multilayered
graphene [15], platinum ribbons [3], Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) based silver
electrodes [16], digitally printed hybrid electrodes for electromyographic recording
[17] or for piezoresistive pressure sensing [18], or channels ﬁlled with conductive
polymer [19].

Whilst the existing designs and implementations are highly impactful, the pro-
totypes of electronic skins lack a capacity to self-repair and grow. Such properties
are useful, and could be necessary, when an electronic skin is used in e.g. unconven-
tional living architecture [20], soft and self-growing robots [21–24] and development
of intelligent materials from fungi [25–28]. Based on our previous experience with
designing tactile, colour sensors from slime mould Physarum polycephalum [29–
31] and our recent results on fungal electrical activity [32–34], as well as following
previously demonstrated thigmotropic and phototropic response (Fig.1) in higher
fungi [35], we decided to propose a thin layer of homogeneous mycelium of the
trimitic polypore species Ganoderma resinaceum as a live electronic skin and thus
investigate its potential to sense and respond to tactile and optical stimuli. We call
the fungal substrate, used in present paper, ‘fungal skin’ due to its overall appearance
and physical feeling. In fact, several species of fungi have been proposed as literal
skin substitutes and tested in wound healing [36–41].

Methods
Potato dextrose agar (PDA), malt extract agar (MEA) and malt extract (ME) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). The Ganoderma resinaceum culture used in
this experiment was obtained from a wild basidiocarp found at the shores of Lago di
Varese, Lombardy (Italy) in 2018 and maintained in alternate PDA and MEA slants
at MOGU S.r.l. for the last 3 years at 4 ◦C under the collection code 019-18.
The fungal skin was prepared as follows. G. resinaceum was grown on MEA plates
and a healthy mycelium plug was inoculated into an Erlenmeyer ﬂask containing
200 ml of 2% ME broth (MEB). The liquid culture ﬂask was then incubated in a
rotary shaker at 200 rpm and 28 oC for 5 days. Subsequently, this liquid culture was
homogenised for 1 minute at max. speed in a sterile 1L Waring laboratory blender
(USA) containing 400 mL of fresh MEB, the resulting 600 mL of living slurry were
then poured into a 35 by 35 cm static fermentation tray. The slurry was let to incubate
undisturbed for 15 days to allow the fungal hyphae to inter-mesh and form a ﬂoating
mat or skin of fungal mycelium. Finally, a living fungal skin circa 1.5 mm thick was
harvested (see texture of the skin in Fig.1a), washed in sterile demineralised water,
cut to the size 23 cm by 11 cm and placed onto a polyurethane base to keep electrodes
stable during the electrical characterisation steps (Fig.1b).
Theelectricalactivityoftheskinwasmeasuredasfollows.Weusediridium-coated
stainless steel sub-dermal needle electrodes (Spes Medica S.r.l., Italy), with twisted
cables. The pairs of electrode were inserted in the fungal skin as shown (Fig.1b):
the ﬁrst placed in position 2 × 5 cm from a vertex, the following placed at 1 cm
distance each. In each pair we recorded a difference in electrical potential between
the electrodes. We used ADC-24 (Pico Technology, UK) high-resolution data logger
with a 24-bit Analog to Digital converter, galvanic isolation and software-selectable
sample rates. We recorded electrical activity with a frequency of one sample per
second. We set the acquisition voltage range to 156 mV with an offset accuracy of

Results
Endogenous electrical activity of the fungal material is polymorphic. Low and high
frequency oscillations patterns can emerge intermittently. A train of four spikes in
Fig.1c is an example of low frequency oscillations. By measuring the electrical
response with multiple electrodes, positioned along coordinated axes like row and
columns of a matrix, and connecting them to a differential operational ampliﬁer,
it is possible to exclude singularities and enhance coordinated responses, which is
indicated as a ﬁltering procedure to exclude endogenous polymorphic activity.
Electrical responses to tactile loading and illumination are distinctive and can
be easily recognized from endogenous activity. An example of several rounds of
stimulation is shown in Fig.3a. The fungal skin responds to loading of a weight
with a high-amplitude wide spike of electrical potential sometimes followed by a
train of high-frequency spikes. The skin also responds to removal of the weight by a
high-amplitude spike of electrical potential (Fig.2).
An exemplar response to loading and removal of weight is shown in Fig.3b. The
parameters of the fungal skin responses to the weight being placed on the skin are
the following. An average delay of the response (the time from weight application
to a peak of the high-amplitude spike) is 911.4 s (σ = 1280.1, minimum 25 s and
maximum 3200 s). An average amplitude of the response spike (marked ‘s’ in the
example Fig.3b) is 0.4 mV (σ = 0.2, minimum 0.1 mV and maximum 0.8 mV).
An average width of the response spike is 1261.8 s (σ = 1420.3, minimum 199 s
and maximum 4080 s), meaning that the average energy consumed per current unit,
associated to the response, is approximately 0.5 J/A. A train of spikes (marked ‘r’ in
the example Fig.3b), if any, following the response spike usually has 4 or 5 spikes.
The fungal skin responds to removal of the weight (the response is marked ‘p’ in
the example Fig.3b) with a spike which average amplitude is 0.4 mV (σ = 0.2,
minimum 0.2 mV and maximum 0.85 mV). Amplitudes are less indicative than
frequencies because an amplitude depends on the position of electrodes with regards
to propagating wave of excitation. An average width of the spike is 774 s (σ = 733.1,
minimum 100 s and maximum 2000 s). A response of the fungal skin to removal of
the weight was not observed in circa 20% of differential electrode pairs. The average
response time is 385.5 s (σ = 693.3 s, minimum 77 s and maximum 1800 s). By
taking into account inter-electrode distance it could be possible to weigh temporal
delays and further strengthen the rejection circuits based on operational ampliﬁers,
as per above suggestion to discard endogenous activity.
The response of the fungal skin to illumination is manifested in the raising of
the baseline potential, as illustrated in the exemplar recordings in Fig.3c. In con-
trast to mechanical stimulation response the response-to-illumination spike does not
subside but the electrical potential stays raised until illumination is switched off.
An average amplitude of the response is 0.61 mV (σ = 0.27, minimum 0.2 mV and
maximum 1 mV). The raise of the potential starts immediately after the illumination
is switched on. The potential saturation time is 2960 s in average (σ = 2201, mini-
mum 879 s and maximum 9530 s); the potential relaxation time is 8700 s in average

(σ = 4500, minimum 962 s and maximum 24790 s). Typically, we did not observe
any spike trains after the illumination switched off however in a couple of trials we
witnessed spike trains on top of the raised potential, as shown in Fig.3d.
In the case of illumination it is particularly easy to imagine how effective a rejec-
tion stage could be, since all the responses are well synchronized (Fig.3c).

Discussion
We demonstrated that a thin sheet of homogeneous living mycelium of Ganoderma
resinaceum, which we named ‘fungal skin’, shows pronounced electrical responses
to mechanical and optical stimulation. Can we differentiate between the fungal skin’s
response to mechanical and optical stimulation? Deﬁnitely, see Fig.4a. The fungal
skin responds to mechanical stimulation with a 15 min spike of electrical potential,
which diminishes even if the applied pressure on the skin remains. The skin responds
to optical stimulation by raising its electrical potential and keeping it raised till the
light is switched off.
Can we differentiate the responses to loading and removal of the weight? Yes.
Whilst amplitudes of ‘loading’ and ‘removal’ spikes are the same (0.4 mV in average)
the fungal skin average reaction time to removal of the weight is 2.4 times shorter
than the reaction to loading of the weight (385 s vs. 911 s). Also ‘loading’ spikes are
1.6 times wider than ‘removal’ spikes (1261 s vs. 774 s).

Fungal skin response to weight application is, in some cases, esp. Figure3b,
similar to response of slime mould to application of the light weight [30]. The fol-
lowing events are observed (Fig.4b): oscillatory activity before stimulation, imme-
diate response to stimulation, prolonged response to stimulation as a train of high-
amplitude spikes, return to normal oscillatory activity. This might indicate some uni-
versal principles of sensing and information processing in fungi and slime moulds.
The sensing fungal skin proposed has a range of advantages comparing to other
living sensing materials, e.g. slime mould sensors [29–31] electronic sensors with
living cell components [42], chemical sensors using living taste, olfactory, and neural
cells and tissues [43] and tactile sensor from living cell culture [44]. The advantages
are low production costs, simple maintenance and durability. The last but not least
advantage is scalability: a fungal skin patch can be as small as few milimeters or it
can be grown to several metres in size.
In future studies we will aim to answer the following questions. Would it be
possible to infer a weight of the load applied to the fungal skin from patterns of its
electrical activity? Would the fungal skin indicate directionality of the load movement
by its spiking activity? Would it be possible to locate the position of the weight within
the fungal network? Would it be possible to map a spectrum of the light applied to
the skin onto patterns of the skin’s electrical activity?

Reactive Fungal Wearable

Abstract Smart wearables sense and process information from the user’s body and
environment and report results of their analysis as electrical signals. Conventional
electronic sensors and controllers are commonly, sometimes augmented by recent
advances in soft electronics. Organic electronics and bioelectronics, especially with
living substrates, offer a great opportunity to incorporate parallel sensing and infor-
mation processing capabilities of natural systems into future and emerging wearables.
Nowadays fungi are emerging as a promising candidate to produce sustainable tex-
tiles to be used as ecofriendly biowearables. To assess the sensing potential of fungal
wearables we undertook laboratory experiments on electrical response of a hemp
fabric colonised by oyster fungi Pleurotus ostreatus to mechanical stretching and
stimulation with attractants and repellents. We have shown that it is possible to dis-
cern a nature of stimuli from the fungi electrical responses. The results paved a way
towards future design of intelligent sensing patches to be used in reactive fungal
wearables.

Introduction
Smart wearables are devices that extend the functionality of clothes and gad-
gets, they are responsive to the wearer and can act as an interface between the
wearer and the environment producing a user responsive symbiotic system. The
smart wearables have been developed as a result of the convergence between tex-
tiles and electronics (e-textiles). They integrate a high level of technology to pro-
vide complex functions and an easy operation and maintenance [1]. They can be
divided into three subgroups: (1) passive smart wearables: able to sense the environ-
ment/user, (2) active or reactive smart wearables: able to sense the environment/user,
and react performing some actions, therefore integrating an actuator, (3) advanced
smart wearables: able to sense, react and adapt their behaviour to given circum-
stances. Sensors provide means to detect signals, actuators react upon stimuli either
autonomously or after commands received from a central processing unit [2]. Textile-
embedded sensing systems have been developed and commercially exploited in both
the biomedical and safety communities [3]. Smart wearables have been used to record
electrocardiography signals [4], electromyography signals [5], electroencephalogra-
phy signals [6], temperature [7], biophotonic sensing [8], movement [9], oxygen
content, salinity, moisture, or contaminants [10, 11]. Active functionalities might
include power generation or storage capabilities [12], machine to human interface
elements [13], radio frequency communication capabilities [14]. Wearable intelli-
gent systems, intrinsically soft and better compliant with extension, deformation and
skin stiffness have been developed since a long time [15].
The electronic wearables cannot self-grow and self-repair. This deﬁciency limits
their application in the ﬁeld of soft robotics and self-growing robots [16–19]. We
can overcome these limits by incorporating living fabric in the smart wearables.
One of the solutions, explored by us previously, would be to grow slime mould P.
polycephalum on a surface of the cloths or a body of a robot [20]. The slime mould
is proven to be a biosensor for the chemical, mechanical and optical stimuli [21–23].
Despite the sufﬁcient sensorial abilities, the slime mould is rather fragile, highly
dependent on environmental conditions and requires particular sources of nutrients.
Fungi could, however, make a feasible alternative to the slime mould. Fungal
materials—grow substrates colonised with mycelium of ﬁlamentous fungi—are
emerging to be robust, reliable and ecologically friendly replacement for conven-
tional building materials and fabrics [24–33]. Fungi “possess almost all the senses
used by humans” [34]. Fungi sense light, chemicals, gases, gravity and electric ﬁelds.
Fungi show a pronounced response to changes in a substrate pH [35], mechanical
stimulation [36], toxic metals [37], CO2 [38], stress hormones [39]. Thus, wearables
made of or incorporating fabric colonised by fungi might act as a large distributed
sensorial network. Fungi is known to respond to chemical and physical stimuli by
changing patterns of its electrical activity [40–42] and electrical properties [43].
This feature would allow to interface fungal wearables with conventional electronics.
In view of their extension and interconnectivity, fungal networks represent certainly
a sustainable infrastructure-forming substrate, able to wire loci separated by consid-

Reactive Fungal Wearable

erable space. Moreover, there are indications that mycelium networks not just sense
the external stimuli but also process information, and that there is feasible opportu-
nity to convert fungal responses into Boolean circuits, thus making fungal wearables
parallel biological processing networks [44]. Previously conducted experiments on
sensorial properties of fungi have been using experimental laboratory setups where
substrates colonised by fungi have been kept in ‘comfortable’ conditions of closed
containers with preserved humidity [45]. To assess the feasibility of a fungal wearable
prototype in the real world we conducted experiments with a thin hemp-mycelium
composite fabric incorporated on a t-shirt wore by a mannequin.
2
Methods
A commercial strain of the fungus P. ostreatus (Mogu’s collection code 21–18),
previously selected for its superior ﬁtness growing on the targeted substrate, was
cultured on a hemp bedding substrate in plastic boxes c. 35 × 20 cm2 in darkness at
ambient room temperature c. 22 ◦C.
A hemp substrate well colonised by the fungus was spread on rectangular frag-
ments, c. 12 × 12 cm2, of moisturised hemp fabric. When the fragments were
colonised, as visualised by white mycelial growth on surface, they were used for
experiments. The colonised fabric was attached to a cloth, which in turn was placed
on a mannequin (Fig.1a). The mannequin was covered by a plastic sheet to prevent a
quick decrease of moisture in the fungal fabric. The fabric was sprayed with distilled
water once per two days. The humidity of the fungal fabric was 70–80% (Merlin-
Laser Protimeter, UK). The experiments were conducted in a room with ambient
temperature 21 ◦C and illumination 30-150 LUX (ISO-Tech ILM 1332A).
Electrical activity of the colonised fabric was recorded using pairs of iridium-
coated stainless steel sub-dermal needle electrodes (Spes Medica S.r.l., Italy), with
twisted cables and ADC-24 (Pico Technology, UK) high-resolution data logger with
a 24-bit A/D converter, galvanic isolation and software-selectable sample rates all
contribute to a superior noise-free resolution. To keep electrodes stable we have been
placing a polyurethane pad under the fabric. The pairs of electrodes were pierced
through the fabric and into the polyurethane pad (Fig.1b and c). We recorded electri-
cal activity one sample per second, where the minimum and maximum logging times
were 60.04 and 93.45h, respectively. During the recording, the logger has been doing
as many measurements as possible (typically up to 600 per second) and saving the
average value. We set the acquisition voltage range to 156 mV with an offset accuracy
of 9 µV at 1Hz to maintain a gain error of 0.1%. Each electrode pair was considered
independently with the noise-free resolution of 17 bits and conversion time of 60 ms.
Each pair of electrodes, further called a Channel (Ch), reported a difference of the
electrical potential between the electrodes. Distance between electrodes was 1–2cm.
In each trial, we recorded 5–8 electrode pairs (Ch) simultaneously. We stimulated
the fungus with 96% ethanol, malt extract powder (Sigma Aldrich, UK) dissolved in

Results
A response of the fungal wearable to a chemo-attractant was studied using malt
extract and dextrose. An exemplar response to application of malt extract is shown in
Fig.2a. The immediate, ﬁrst 3 h, response is manifested in the spikes up to 15 mV and

duration up to 140min, and is due to a sudden increase in humidity of the substrate.
Further response is attributed to fungi sensing malt extract as a chemo-attractant and a
source of nutrients. The onset of the response is characterised by low frequency trains
of spikes (Fig.2b). There are 3–4 spikes, with amplitude over 2 mV, in each train.
Average distance between spikes in each train is 291s, σ = 90, average spike width
is 273s, σ = 110, average spike amplitude 2.6 mV, σ = 0.15. Average duration of
a train is 31min, σ = 3, a distance is up to one hour. Typically, a frequency of spike
trains increases with time, a distance between trains decreases to 15min in average,
σ = 5 (Fig.2c). Average amplitude of spike trains is 4.6 mV, σ = 2.5.
Results of experiments with malt extract echo in the experiments with application
of dextrose (Fig.2d). The fungi show low frequency oscillatory activity before stim-
ulation: average distance between spikes is 197min, σ = 13.9, average amplitude
0.3 mV, σ = 0.2. In ﬁrst 5h after the dextrose application the frequency of spikes
substantially increases: average distance between spikes becomes 22min, σ = 13
and amplitude increases to average 0.43 mV, σ = 0.27. In next 5h average ampli-

tude of spikes increases to 1.3 mV, σ = 0.35, and distance between spikes 20min,
σ = 7.
To assess a response to chemo-repellents we used ethanol. We applied 1 ml of
96% ethanol on the colonised fabric near loci of Ch5. The response on one of the
channel close to the application loci is shown in Fig.2e. We observed a drop by
nearly 8 mV followed by further drop of the electrical potential by nearly 8 mV.
The time to the peak of the response is c. 7s. The drop in potential followed by
repolarisation phase, which lasted c. 14s. The potential remained c. 11 mV lower
than that before stimulation. The response on channels further from the application
loci is less pronounced, as seen in Fig.2f. The spikes of electrical potential recorded
on the channels have the following amplitudes: 0.65 mV on Ch1, 0.34 mV on Ch3,
0.31 mV on Ch7, 0.5 mV on Ch11, and 0.3 mV on Ch13, where Ch1 is the closest
to the application loci and Ch13 is the farthest one.
To uncover the fungal wearable’s response to stretching we attached 50 and 200g
weights to the bottom part of the fabric colonised by the fungus. A typical response
to the application of 50g weight is shown in Fig.3a). The response duration is 97s
in average, σ = 37 s with average response amplitudes is 1.3 mV, σ = 0.74 mV.
Differential electrode pairs, labelled as channels in Fig.3a have been arranged in
a line from the top to the bottom (Fig.1), with Ch1 being closest to the top of the
fabric and Ch13 to the bottom part. Most of the response spikes show action potential
like depolarisation, repolarisation and hyperpolarisation phases. Ch1 and Ch13 show
hyperpolarisation phases set up at higher, compared to that before stimulation, base
potential.
On application of 200g weight to lower part of the fabric, variety of response from
differential electrodes pairs have been recorded. An exemplar response is shown in
Fig.3b. The response has an average duration 38min, σ = 2 min, and average ampli-
tude 1.56 mV, σ = 1.24 mV. The response in the example consists of two trains of
high (‘high’ in the frameworks of fungal temporal activity) frequency spikes. Aver-
age spike width is 80s (σ = 50), average amplitude 0.31 mV (σ = 0.32), average
distance between spike in each train is 71s (σ = 47 s).
Overall reaction to the removal of the stretching stimuli is in the drift of the
base potentials on electrodes towards zero, e.g. in Fig.3c we see that the average
based potential is −1.17, σ = 2 mV, before stimulation was removed, and −0.8,
σ = 1.3 mV, after the weight was removed. A typical response, to removal of 200g,
recorded on a single Ch is shown in Fig.3d). The spike there has a duration of 9 s
and amplitude 11 mV.

Discussion
We demonstrated that a fabric colonised by the fungus P. ostreatus shows distinc-
tive sets of responses to chemical and mechanical stimulation. The response to 50g
load, Fig.3a, is in the range of c. 1.5min which might indicate that rather purely
electro-mechanical events take place than reactions involving propagation of cal-

the electrodes pairs in the line is as follows: d(Ch1, Ch3)=3.6s, d(Ch1, Ch5)=20s,
d(Ch1, Ch7)=16s, d(Ch1, Ch13)=3s. This might indicate that the mycelium net-
works closer to the ﬁxed end (Ch1) and the end where the load is attached (Ch13)
react to the stretching ﬁrst, the reaction then propagates further into the interior parts
of the fabric, thus delayed reactions are recorded on the channels Ch5 and Ch7.
The response to stimulation with ethanol is in a range of 7s. This would rather
indicate physico-chemical damages to hyphae walls and corresponding electrical
responses. Would amplitude of a response spike reﬂect a distance to the stimulation
loci? As seen in Fig.2f), on most channel the response amplitudes slightly decrease
with increasing distance to the stimulation loci however more studies are required to
give a certain answer. The response on the channels remote to the stimulation loci
happens at the same time, as on the channel in proximity of the stimulation loci.
This indicates that the response might be purely electrical (due to damage to cell
walls impulse) and not due to diffusion in the fabric or volatile ethanol.
The increase of frequency of electrical potential oscillation in a response to appli-
cation of chemo-attractants or nutrients is consistent with previous studies, where
intracellular electrical potential of stimulated fungi was measured [40]. Even if in
the case of malt extract solution increased spiking could be attributed to a water
the experiments with dextrose, which was applied dry, show that the spiking shown

increased frequency, and often amplitude, due to reaction to a chemoattractant or
nutrient. The increase in amplitude of spiking ﬁve hours after the application of malt
or dextrose might be due to the fungus ingesting the nutrients and transposing them
across the wide mycelial network.
In laboratory conditions the fungal wearables survive for several months being
kept in high humidity conditions. For practical future applications of the fungal
wearables, preserving the moisture is fundamental. For example, the fragments of
fungal materials could be coated with a breathable bioplastic.
Future developments in the ﬁeld of fungal wearables may be along the following
directions.
First direction is a computational one. We demonstrate in computational models
that a fungal colony can implement a range of Boolean function [44]. It might be
possible to implement an experimental mapping between a set of stimuli and distri-
bution of Boolean gates implemented by fungal wearables, as we demonstrated on
sensing and computing organic liquid skin [47]. In other words, in a response to a
particular stimuli the fungal wearable will generate a unique set of Boolean function.
Second direction is in development of a large scale fabric made purely from
mycelium—fungal skin (Fig.4) and tailoring the fabric into wearables. Such mycelial
tissue can be prepared using trimitic polypore fungal cultures, which are appar-

ently preferred for the production of sturdy fungal skins, such as fungal leather or
mycoleather [33]. More speciﬁcally, a fungal fabric can be prepared by pouring a
homogenised slurry of a liquid culture of Ganoderma resinaceum into a static fer-
mentation tray and incubated for two weeks to allow the fungal hyphae to intermesh,
forming a ﬂoating mat or skin [42]. Examples of such type of fungal fabrics are
shown in Fig.4.
Third direction would be to culture fungi directly onto the pieces of clothing
(Fig.5a). This will allow us to achieve full response cloths and garments.
Fourth direction in the development of fungal wearables could be in using fungal
hyphae (Fig.5b) as wires and programmable (with e.g. light) resistor or electrically
activated resistive switching devices in hybrid architectures incorporating conven-
tional ﬂexible electronics [48] and live fungi. Routing the direction of the fungal
wires can be done by arranging sources of attractants and repellents. Isolation of
fungal wires, as well as localized connections when ordered arrays like the cross-bar
array arrangement are required, could be done using inorganic materials, such as
metal oxides of the proper work function deposited by means of atomic layer depo-
sition [49], or digitally printed over a large scale, also in case of uneven surfaces [50].

and Andrew Adamatzky
Abstract Fungi cells can sense extracellular signals via reception, transduction, and
response mechanisms, allowing them to communicate with their host and adapt to
their environment. They feature effective regulatory protein expressions that enhance
and regulate their response and adaptation to various triggers such as stress, hor-
mones, physical stimuli as light, and host factors. In our recent studies, we have
shown that Pleurotus oyster fungi generate electrical potential impulses in the form
of spike events in response to their exposure to environmental, mechanical and chem-
ical triggers, suggesting that the nature of stimuli may be deduced from the fungal
electrical responses. In this study, we explored the communication protocols of fungi
as reporters of human chemical secretions such as hormones, addressing whether
fungi can sense human signals. We exposed Pleurotus oyster fungi to hydrocorti-
sone, which was directly applied to the surface of a fungal-colonised hemp shav-
ings substrate, and recorded the electrical activity of the fungi. Hydrocortisone is a
medicinal hormone replacement that is similar to the natural stress hormone cortisol.
Changes in cortisol levels released by the body indicate the presence of disease and
can have a detrimental effect on physiological process regulation. The response of
fungi to hydrocortisone was also explored further using X-ray to reveal changes in

the fungi tissue, where receiving hydrocortisone by the substrate can inhibit the ﬂow

Introduction
All living organisms have evolved elaborate communication processes and mech-
anisms to sense, respond, and adapt to the surrounding environment in order to
survive.1These processes take place through reception, transduction, and response
systems, which enable them to sense and adapt to their surroundings in response to
a variety of cues such as nutrients, light, gases, stress, and host factors. Any form of
communication requires the existence of three essential elements: a sender, a mes-
sage, and a receiver. The process begins with a sender releasing a message and ends
with a receiver understanding the message [1]. Fungi are composed of eukaryotic
cells that report, react, and adapt to external stimuli primarily through signal trans-
duction pathways [2]. They have extracellular and intracellular sensing mechanisms,
as well as protein receptors that enable them to detect and respond to a variety of
signals. Pleurotus ostreatus, a basidiomycete fungi, has effective regulatory protein
expression that enhances its adaptation to stress triggers [3].
In our previous studies, we reported that the oyster fungi Pleurotus djamor exhibit
trains of electrical potential spikes similar to action potential spikes [4–7]. Our ini-
tial assumption was that spike trains might reﬂect increasing mycelium propagation
in the substrate, nutrient and metabolite transport, and communication processes
within the mycelium network. We investigated the information-theoretic complexity
of fungal electrical activity [8–10] to pave the way for additional investigation into
sensorial fusion and fungi decision making [11–13]. Later, in a series of labora-
tory experiments [14, 15], we demonstrated that fungal electrical activity patterns,
speciﬁcally mycelium bound hemp composite, changes in response to stimuli such
as light, mechanical stretching, and attractants and repellents. Our ﬁndings demon-
strated that fungi are a promising candidate for producing sustainable textiles for use
as eco-friendly bio-wearables.
We present an illustrative scoping study in which we investigate the short and long-
term dynamics in mycelium of the oyster fungi Pleurotus ostreatus in response to
stimulation with hydrocortisone. The purpose of this study is to enthuse the scientiﬁc
community to address the issue of fungi being able to sense animal hormones. The
human body’s adrenal glands release hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline.
Cortisol levels in various bodily ﬂuids can range from 4 to 70 pM [16, 17]. Sweat
cortisol levels have a strong correlation with salivary cortisol concentrations [18],
and the optimal cortisol level ranges from 0.02 to 0.5 M [16, 17]. Monitoring cortisol

levels in bodily ﬂuids, which can be altered by chronic stress and disease, is critical
for maintaining healthy physiological conditions. For this study, not only are the
electrical activities investigated, but the substrate is also irradiated with the X-ray
beam from multiple angles to produce cross-sectional images of the substrate [19].
This multimodal approach enables us to identify and track the dynamics of changes
in the tissue of the mycelium anatomy.
We demonstrated that fungi’s electrical responses and reconstructed computed
tomography images can be used to detect the presence of stimuli. The ﬁndings could
lead to the development of biosensing patches for use in organic electronics and
bio-electronics, especially with living substrates, which offer a great opportunity to
integrate natural systems’ parallel sensing and information processing capabilities
into future and emerging wearables.

Methods
2.1
Experimental Setup
A commercial strain of the fungus Pleurotus ostreatus (Mogu’s collection code
21–18), preselected for showing a superior ﬁtness growing on different lignocel-
lulosic substrates, was cultured on sterilised hemp shives contained in plastic boxes
c. 35 × 20 cm2 in darkness at ambient room temperature c. 22 ◦C. Particles of
substrate well colonised by the fungus were spread on rectangular fragments, c.
12 × 12 cm2, of moisturised nonwoven hemp ﬁbre mats. When the mats were prop-
erly colonised, as visually conﬁrmed by white and homogeneous mycelial growth
on the surface, these were used in the experiments. The humidity of the hemp mats
ranged from 70 to 80% (MerlinLaser Protimeter, UK). The experiments were carried
out in a room with an ambient temperature of c. 21 ◦C in the absence of light. It is
worth mentioning that it takes approximately 25 days for the mats to be properly
colonised, depending on the mat size, the ambient room temperature, and the lig-
nocellulosic substrates chosen for the experiments. Figure1 shows examples of the
experimental setups.
Electrical activity of the colonised hemp mats was recorded using pairs of iridium-
coated stainless steel sub-dermal needle electrodes (Spes Medica S.r.l., Italy) with
twisted cables, via a high-resolution data logger with a 24-bit A/D converter, gal-
vanic isolation, and software-selectable sample rates (Pico Technology, UK). The
electrodes were placed in a straight line with a distance of 1–2cm. To keep the
electrodes stable, we put a polyurethane pad underneath the fabric. As a result, the
electrode pairs were inserted through the fabric and onto the polyurethane pad, as
shown in Fig.1a.
In each trial, we recorded the electrical activity of seven electrode pairs simulta-
neously. Each pair of electrodes, referred to as a Channel (Ch), reported a difference
in the electrical potential between the electrodes. The electrical activity was recorded

in the tent
at a rate of one sample per second (1Hz), with logging times ranging from 60.04
to 93.45h for the different experiments. Throughout the recording, the logger took
as many samples as it could (typically up to 600 per second) and saved the average
value. We set the acquisition voltage range to 156 mV with an offset accuracy of
9 µV at 1Hz to maintain a gain error of 0.1%. Each electrode pair was considered
independently with a noise-free resolution of 17 bits and conversion time of 60 ms.
We measured and logged a range of resistances 1–1.6 k using Fluke 8846A preci-
sion multi-meter, where the test current being 1 ± 0.0013 µA, once per 10s, 5 × 104
samples per trial [7]. Furthermore, the electrical resistance of the electrodes is always
less than 10 , making it minor in comparison to the resistance of the mycelium.
Even employing pure gold electrodes would have no effect on the trials. Figure1b
shows one of the recording setup inside a light-proof growing tent.
For stimulation, we used hydrocortisone (Solu-Cortef trademark, 4mL Act-O-
Vial, Pﬁzer, Athens, Greece). We then applied 2mL of the resulting solution to the
surface of the colonised substrate in the loci surrounding Ch4 and Ch5.
The following was the rationale behind the dosage selection: human patients
weighing 80kg are typically given 20mg of synthetic cortisol per day for a variety of
diseases, such as maintenance therapy for patients with hypopituitarism. As a result,
20mg divided by 80kg yields 0.25mg/kg. Hemp mats colonised with fungi weighed
around 100–200g each, so a 2mL dose of 250 µg was needed.
2.2
Electrical Activity Analysis
Extracellular signals which surpassed a certain amplitude threshold with depolarisa-
tion, repolarisation, and refractory cycles are referred to as spike events (see Fig.2).
Spike events represent the physiological and morphological processes of mycelium
in the colonised hemp mat. We proposed a novel method for identifying spiking
events, including three main stages as (1) splitting signal into chunks, (2) smoothing
the chunk by mapping the constant amplitude to an instantaneous amplitude, and (3)
detecting spike events.

S = {s1, s2, . . . , sη}, where η << T . We segmented the signal X using the idea of
the variable size sliding window to analyse its dynamics before and after hydro-
cortisone application in the same intervals. Each segment was then subdivided into
chunks of m = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16} h. Note that the chunk m = 16 in all 16 experiments
does not have the same length that resulted in 12–16h of electrical activity recording.
The electrical activity of the colonised hemp mats with fungi displays diffraction
patterns. The presence of these diffraction patterns from multiple slits can cause
determining spike events to be distorted. The envelope of an oscillating signal can
expand the concept of constant amplitude to instantaneous amplitude and, there-
fore, bypass multiple slits with a single slit diffraction pattern to outline signiﬁcant
extremes, i.e., spike events [10].
To obtain the signal envelope (ξ), we used the discrete Fourier Transform, as
implemented in the Hilbert transform, to detect the analytical signal. Then, inspired
by Marple et al. [20], we set the negative frequency in half of each spectral period to
zero, resulting in a periodic one-sided spectrum. More formally, using the sampling
theorem [21], we convert the input chunk2, X, into a sequence of values with the
sample period of τ ≜w T
fs (see Eq.1).

of L[n], with sampling at τ intervals to prevent aliasing (see Eq.2). We take the

and neutralise diffraction patterns.

signal using the upper and lower envelopes to identify spike events. All amplitude
values greater than or equal to the upper envelope and less than or equal to the lower
envelope are replaced with the upper and lower envelope values, respectively, while
all other amplitude values are preserved. Then, as in Eq.6, we calculate the absolute
differences between the input signal (x) and this intermediate representation (˜x).

events. However, because this limitation applies to all trials, we report the amortised
complexity analysis. Figure3 shows an example of the proposed method’s results.

CT Images Analysis
To gain a better understanding of the effect of stimuli on the fungal substrate, we
prepared two containers. Two hours before being irradiated with an X-Ray beam
using the dual-energy Discovery City 750 HD CT scanner, one container received
no stimuli, while the other received hydrocortisone. The detector provides for data

acquisition with 64 detector rows of 0.625mm collimation. Together with a z-ﬂying
focal spot, this allows simultaneous acquisition of data in 64 × 0.625 slices. The
tubes were operated at 120 kVp. The gantry rotation time of the system is 0.35s. CT
images were reconstructed using Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction [23].
The image sets were reconstructed at a slice thickness of 1.25mm, performing 128
slices per rotation (see Fig.4a). We used two different containers since the fungal
colony retains its integrity through the ﬂow of cytoplasm in the mycelium network,
where calcium waves [24] and associated electrical potential waves change the prop-
agation coordinate of this ﬂow.
Therefore, we were able to analyse the stimuli spread across the ﬂow of cytoplasm
by comparing the CT image of the container that had not received any stimulus with
the container that had only one segment exposed (see Fig.4b, c). When working with
images in the spatial domain, we deal with changes in pixel values with respect to
the scene. In the frequency domain, however, we are interested in the rate at which
the pixel values in the spatial domain change, which provides us with a better under-
standing of the underlying distribution of changes and complexities. The discrete
cosine transform (DCT) was used in this study (see Eq.8) to transform the input CT
image IR×C from the spatial domain to the frequency domain, allowing us to divide
the image into spectral sub-bands of varying signiﬁcance. This transform can also
concentrate the majority of the image’s visually important details in just a few DCT
coefﬁcients. This property enables us to uncover changes in the substrate that are not
apparent throughout visual inspection.

Statistical and Information Theory Metrics
In statistics [25] and information theory [26], the concept of entropy is essential.
In statistics, entropy refers to the inference functional for an updating process, and
in information theory, it speciﬁes the shortest attainable encoding scheme. Recent
advances in complex dynamical systems, on the other hand, have necessitated an
extension of the entropy theory beyond the conventional Shannon-Gibbs entropy
(H) [27]. In this study, we used the Rényi (Rq) [28] and Tsallis (Tq) [29] additive
entropyconcepts,whicharegeneralisationsoftheclassicalShannonentropy.Regard-

statistical estimation theory. Shannon, Tsallis, and Rényi entropy measurements are

Here, S is a discrete random variable that represents spike events, with potential out-
comes in the set S = {s1, s2, . . . , sη} and corresponding probabilities pi .= Pr(S =

i pi = 1,
and q is the entropic-index or Rényi entropy order with q ≥0 and q ̸= 1, which in
our experiments was set to 2.
We take the logarithm to be in base 2, since we interpreted the entire recording
duration T with bits, with ‘1s’ indicating the availability of spike events and ‘0s’
otherwise. To determine spike diversity across all channels, we represent recordings
by a binary matrix with a row for each channel. We calculated the Lempel–Ziv
complexity (L Zc) over channels using the Kolmogorov complexity algorithm [30]
to capture both temporal and spatial diversity. We then concatenated the rows of this
binary matrix to form a single binary string and normalised L Zc by dividing the raw
value by the randomly shufﬂed value obtained for the same binary input sequence
to obtain PCIpK. Since the value of PCIpK for a ﬁxed-length binary sequence is

data points as a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies. a On a non-exposed
container, higher energies (red hue) are concentrated in the top left corner, while lower energies
(green and blue hues) are concentrated in the bottom right corner. b The cortisol-exposed segment
has a lower concentration of high energy in the top left corner and a higher dispersion of low energy
(blue hue). c The no-exposed segment has a moderate energy distribution than the others, where
the higher-energy spectral sub-bands are scattered rather than being concentrated in a few DCT

maximum when it is totally random, the normalised values reﬂect the degree of
signal diversity on a scale of 0 to 1.
Other metrics that were used to quantify the complexity of spike events are Simp-
son’s diversity, Space-ﬁlling, and Expressiveness. Simpson’s diversity is calculated
as  = 
i(p(si))2. For H < 3, it correlates linearly with Shannon entropy, and the
relationship becomes logarithmic for higher values of H. The value of  varies from
0 to 1, with 1 representing inﬁnite diversity and 0 representing no diversity. Space-
ﬁlling () is the ratio of non-zero entries in the binary representation of X to the total
duration of the recording T . Expressiveness (ϒ) is calculated as the Shannon entropy
H divided by space-ﬁlling ratio , which represents the economy of diversity.

Results
Table1 presents a qualitative description of electrical activity for one of the trials,
where all complexity metrics can be compared for the condition in which the sub-
strate was exposed 16h before hydrocortisone exposure and 1h after hydrocortisone
exposure.
Figure6 graphically summarises the qualitative description of electrical activity
for all trials in a multi-curve layout that can be used to easily identify those metrics
that are more inﬂuenced by stimulation with hydrocortisone and can thus be used to
track the impacts in electrical dynamics complexity. The different panels implicitly
represent time, where Fig.6a refers to 16h before exposure, Fig.6b refers to the
exposure or trigger event, and Fig.6c refers to 1h after exposure. The x-axis, where
the channels are aligned, represents space. Those complexity metrics with no varia-
tion appear ﬂat (for example after trigger the Shannon entropy for the signal, shown
in red in the plots). Those inﬂuenced show positive or negative peaks, either to the
left (Shannon entropy for the spike event, Simpson’s diversity, Space-ﬁlling, Expres-
siveness, Kolmogorov Complexity, and PCIpK) or towards the right of the sample
(Tsallis and Rényi entropies). By superimposing complexity metrics on each chan-
nel and reconstructing the time evolution of the spiking dynamics the mycelium, we
can create a graphical representation of the excitatory or inhibitory state before, dur-
ing, and after hydrocortisone exposure, demonstrating the formation of an electrical
activity ﬁngerprint that corresponds to that speciﬁc event (see Fig.6e).
We found that the PCIpK, Tsallis, and Rényi entropies are the most relevant
metrics for system analysis among all complexity measurements considered here (see
Fig.7). The PCIpK measure provides an easy inspection of the substrate’s evolution
analysis,includingitsspatio-temporalfeatures.Figure7ashowsthatahydrocortisone
stimulus induces a much stronger response in the application locus. Following a
stimulus, some excitation events can be seen propagating in the substrate at much
lower potentials. Tsallis entropy, as shown in Fig.7b, is less sensitive but more
accurate in tracking the evolution of the reference electrode signal. We can see from
Fig.7c that Rényi entropy helps us to monitor peak evolution over time.

Discussion
Theintegrityof thefungal colonyis preservedbycytoplasmﬂowinthemyceliumnet-
work,wherecalciumwaves[24]changetheﬂow’spropagationcoordination.Cortisol
metabolism stimulates the production of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa-
B ligand (RANKL), a type II membrane protein that regulates bone regeneration
and remodelling in mammals [31]. The activity of cells responsible for calcium
resorption from bone is inhibited when RANKL is stimulated [32]. The elevated
circulating cortisol levels maintain stress levels, triggering physiological changes in
the body’s regulatory networks. Hog1 is a stress-activated mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) in fungi that is homologous to the p38 MAPK pathways in mam-
mals [33]. When exposed to stress conditions, Hog1 rapidly dephosphorylates and
induces the appropriate cellular responses against the offending environmental stim-
uli [34]. We speculate that receiving cortisol by the substrate can inhibit the ﬂow of
calcium and, in turn, reduce its physiological changes.

Conclusion
We conclude that the effects of hydrocortisone exposure on a Pleurotus ostreatus
mycelium can be demonstrated using a well-known combination of techniques in a
proper interdisciplinary approach. The computed tomography shows a change in grey
tones as a result of hydrocortisone exposure, which is associated with active ion trans-
port triggered in the living mycelium in response to the hormone. Simultaneously, by
capturing biopotential signals and extracting their numerical complexity, we could
identify consistent metrics for tracing the stimulus and tracking the propagation of
ionic waves in response to the hormone. Our research extends our understanding of
living fungal, which could be used in future wearable and architectural systems to
beneﬁt living species while also maximising sustainability.

Fungal Photosensors

Abstract The rapidly developing research ﬁeld of organic analogue sensors aims to
replace traditional semiconductors with naturally occurring materials. Photosensors,
or photodetectors, change their electrical properties in response to the light levels they
are exposed to. Organic photosensors can be functionalised to respond to speciﬁc
wavelengths, from ultra-violet to red light. Performing cyclic voltammetry on fungal
mycelium and fruiting bodies under different lighting conditions shows no apprecia-
ble response to changes in lighting condition. However, functionalising the specimen
using PEDOT:PSS yields in a photosensor that produces large, instantaneous current
spikes when the light conditions change. Future works would look at interfacing
this organic photosensor with an appropriate digital back-end for interpreting and
processing the response.

Introduction
The world’s drive for sustainability dictates a need to develop ‘green architectures’,
where buildings are made from natural, recyclable materials and incorporate liv-
ing matter in their constructions [1, 2]. Recent examples include algae facades
[3, 4], buildings incorporating bio-reactors [5] and buildings made from pre-
fabricated blocks of substrates colonised by fungi [6–8]. Not long ago we proposed
growing monolith constructions from live fungal materials, where living mycelium
coexist with dry mycelium functionalised with nanoparticles and polymers [9]. In
such monolith constructions, fungi could act as optical, tactile and chemical sensors,
fuse and process information and make decisions [10].
Functionalisation of living substrates aimed at increasing their sensitivity or con-
ductivity, or imbuing them with novel properties, has been achieved before. Exam-

ples include: tuning electrical properties of plants and slime mould with nanopar-
ticles [11, 12], increasing photosynthetic properties of plants with nanoparticles
[13, 14] and hybridizing slime mould with conductive polymers [15, 16]. An impor-
tant advantage of functionalising living substrates with particles, and/or polymers,
is that the substrate will remain functional, as an inanimate electronic device, even
when no longer living. Here, in an attempt to advance our ideas of living fungal archi-
tectures, sensors and computers, we explore the photosensitive properties of the grey
oyster mushroom with aim of designing and prototyping novel organic electronic
devices.
The ﬁeld of organic analogue electronics replaces traditional semi-conductors
with organic material. This can be seen in the development of organic thin ﬁlm tran-
sistors [17–19], organic LEDs [20, 21], and sensors, such as photosensors [22–27].
Organic photosensors are a potentially disruptive technology that lend themselves
well to being tuned for speciﬁc band absorption [28]. Additionally, organic electron-
ics have the potential to self heal as the substrate is a living material [29]. Function-
alising organic compounds with polymers can create hybrid components that utilise
speciﬁc properties from the various individual compounds. For example, increasing
the capacitance of a multi-layer capacitor using photosensitivity [30]. Fungi have the
capacity to readily transport polymers which can be used to functionalise the speci-
men. Given these properties, fungi may be a useful substrate for the development of
organic photosensors and a digital back-end can be used to interpret and process the
signal. The chapter explores the use of the fruiting bodies of the grey oyster fungi
as photosensors and present the implications of such an application when used in
organic electronic systems.

Experimental Method
Samples of mycelium and fruiting bodies of the grey oyster fungi Pleurotus ostreatus
(Ann Miller’s Speciality Mushrooms Ltd, UK), cultivated on damp wood shavings,
are explored for their photosensitive properties. Iridium-coated stainless steel sub-
dermal needles with twisted cables (Spes Medica SRL, Italy) were inserted approxi-
mately 10mm apart in samples An LCR meter (BK Precision, model 891) was used
to constantly record the DC resistance of the sample. The sample was periodically
covered or exposed to intense light (c. 1500Lux, with a cold light source PL2000,
Photonic Optics, USA). Exposure to the high intensity light was in the order of tens
of seconds. The container with PEDOT:PSS functionalised fungi was kept in a fume
hood for the duration of the experiment.
The I-V characteristics of the fungal substrate were measured using a Keithely
source measure unit (SMU) 2450 (Keithley Instruments, USA). Cyclic voltammetry
was conducted as using a voltage steps of 0.01V between −1 and 1V. The delay
between setting each voltage increment was 0.1s. Cyclic voltammetry was performed
under both constant and changing light conditions. Similar tests were performed with
a pure resistive load as a control.

In the experiments on functionalised fruit bodies, 10ml of PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-
ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate) (Sigma Aldrich, UK) solution was
injected in the stalks the fruit bodies. The fungi were rested for 24h to allow for
translocation of them material towards other parts of the stem and caps of the bodies.

Results
Two individual cultures of mycelium and fruiting bodies of the grey oyster mushroom
(sample 1 and sample 2) (before functionalisation) were subject to cyclic voltamme-
try under both constant and changing lighting conditions—Figs.1 and 2. The cyclic
voltammetry gives a mem-fractive response where elements of memristive and mem-
capactive properties are seen [31]. Combining the cyclic voltammetry with instan-
taneously changing light conditions (runs 3–5 in Fig.1) showed no notable change
when compared to constant light conditions. Cyclic voltammetry of the mycelium
specimenunderinstantaneouslychanginglightconditions(runs3–5inFig.1)showed
no notable change when compared to constant light conditions. Similarly, we saw
the same when comparing the cyclic voltammetry of fruiting bodies in Fig.2. Runs
1 and 2 are constant lighting conditions and run 3 is changing lighting conditions.
As samples of grey oyster fungi are functionalised with PEDOT:PSS they are also
dried out. The process of drying the mushrooms reduces their natural conductivity.
However the presence of the PEDOT:PSS in the dried fruit bodies . Figure3 shows
the I-V response of the functionalised fruiting body with constant light changes.
Again, a mem-fractive response is achieved [31].
In fruiting bodies injected with PEDOT:PSS, rapid changes in lighting conditions
produced instantaneous changes in the conducted current. Figures4 and 5 show the I-
V response for the functionalised specimen, under changing light conditions. Figure4
has the specimen being subject to changes in ambient lab lighting during the positive
phase of the cyclic voltammetry between 0 and 0.5V. Signiﬁcant spikes, eight fold

light conditions.
Figure5 shows the same specimen being subjected to more extreme changes in
lighting conditions. The I-V curves continue to exhibit a number of spikes, where
the spikes correspond to the point at which the lighting conditions were changed.
Figure5b has greater noise on the I-V curve making distinguishing the response
harder (SNR ranges between c. 5.5 and 1.3). The injected specimen was allowed to
progressively dry out as cyclic voltammetry was conducted. The drier the specimen
becomes, the noisier the recordings can become.
Dried fruit bodies located further, c. 25cm, from the injection site of the
PDOT:PSS were also subjected to cyclic voltammetry. Figure6 shows the response
of the sample under the control conditions. The specimen had very poor conductive

Fig. 7 Cyclic voltammetry of dried sample of grey oyster mushrooms. Samples are periodically
exposed to intense light changes from darkness to 1500lux
properties. Presumably this is due to the fact that the injection site of the PEDOT:PSS
was sufﬁciently far from the recording site that there was, at best, only minimal uptake
of the conductive polymer. However, sweeping the voltage did result in some change
in conducted current, although always in the pico-Amps range.
Cyclic voltammetry was then performed on the same specimen during intense
changes in lighting conditions (Fig.7). Here, increasing and decreasing the light
levels also resulted in an instantaneous spike in the conducted current. However, this
specimen was not as responsive as the specimen injected directly with PEDOT:PSS.

Conclusions
Fungi are known for their photosensitive nature, with research showing fungi can be
more photosensitive than green plants [32, 33]. Fungi are most receptive towards the
UV end of the spectrum but exhibit photoresponses across the entire light spectrum.
Brieﬂy exposing fungi to light can interrupt their current growth cycle, triggering
other responses. The reported photosensitivity of fungi inspired us to check if the
fungi can be used as photosensors.
The cyclic voltammetry of the mycelium and fruit bodies specimens shows that
exposing the test subject to instantaneously changing light conditions has no dis-
cernible impact on conducted current when compared to keeping the light conditions
constant. Extreme constant lighting conditions (darkness or extreme illumination)
again has little to no bearing on the I–V curves for cyclic voltammetry. Under all
conditions, the specimens exhibit characteristic mem-fractance responses [34]. The
lack of response to the stimulation with light might be due to the fact that the bio-
chemical responses required to initiate electric responses might take several hours
and, therefore, the length of recordings made here was not sufﬁcient to capture
such changes. This leads to us to conclude that intact fungi can be not be used as
immediate-response photoswitches.
Functionalisingthespecimenwithaconductivepolymer,inthiscasePEDOT:PSS,
and re-performing cyclic voltammetry yielded a photosensitive response when the
light conditions change instantaneously. Therefore, polyﬂuorene and PEDOT:PSS
photosenesing inks [35], n-Si/PEDOT:PSS solar cells [36], by functionalising mush-
rooms using the conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS, we were able to produce a pho-
tosensor. Furthermore, the spikes in the cyclic voltammetry were signiﬁcant enough
to be detectable by additional hardware. Future work would be to develop the dig-
ital back-end that can be used to interpret and process the spiking response of the
mushrooms.

Reactive Fungal Insoles

and Andrew Adamatzky
Abstract Mycelium bound composites are promising materials for a diverse range
of applications including wearables and building elements. Their functionality sur-
passes some of the capabilities of traditionally passive materials, such as synthetic
ﬁbres, reconstituted cellulose ﬁbres and natural ﬁbres. Thereby, creating novel propo-
sitions including augmented functionality (sensory) and aesthetic (personal fashion).
Biomaterials can offer multiple modal sensing capability such as mechanical load-
ing (compressive and tensile) and moisture content. To assess the sensing potential
of fungal insoles we undertook laboratory experiments on electrical response of
bespoke insoles made from capillary matting colonised with oyster fungi Pleuro-
tus ostreatus to compressive stress which mimics human loading when standing and
walking. We have shown changes in electrical activity with compressive loading. The
results advance the development of intelligent sensing insoles which are a building
block towards more generic reactive fungal wearables. Using FitzhHugh-Nagumo
model we numerically illustrated how excitation wave-fronts behave in a mycelium
network colonising an insole and shown that it may be possible to discern pressure
points from the mycelium electrical activity.

or optical sensor technologies in relevant locations for monitoring the foot-ground
interaction force [1], providing complex functions and exhibiting broad sensing range
when exposed to mechanical stimuli. Smart insoles can be divided into three sub-
groups: (1) passive smart insoles able to sense parameters including weight loading
of user, local terrain topology, volatile organic compounds, (2) active or reactive
smart insoles able to sense and react performing some actions, by integrating an
actuator, (3) advanced smart insoles able to sense, react and tailor their behaviour to
speciﬁc operating circumstances.
Integrating sensor technologies into insoles, patterns and strategies for executing
different functional tasks can be assessed, capturing data that can form the basis for
use in areas such as rehabilitation, prehabilitation, monitoring elderly people who
have mobility problems, mitigating slipping and falling as well as assessing long-
term chronic conditions such as dementia, Parkinson’s disease and stroke [2]. For
example, smart insoles have been used for the measurement of the weight pressure
distribution that a patient exerts on each foot, in addition to the gait time, swing time,
and stance time of each leg while walking to diagnose several medical conditions [3].
Smart insoles have lately found new applications outside the clinical domain. The
proliferation of consumer-grade smart wearables has further propelled the develop-
ment of commercial in-shoe devices to assess health and wellness-related mobility
parameters in activities of daily living [4–7] e.g., pressure mapping of insoles in
footwear based on conventional sensor technology (e.g. dielectric layer) have been
reported [8, 9] and insoles with diagnostic capabilities are commercially available,
for example NURVV Run Smart Insoles [10]. While the use of smart insoles in non-
medical applications has recently attracted signiﬁcant interest, there are important
challenges to overcome.
Cost represents a limiting factor. The devices require a number of sensors and actu-
ators driven by electrical circuit components, usually supplied by a battery, making
them not only expensive to fabricate but also signiﬁcantly contributing to the deple-
tion of natural resources. Insoles based on conventional sensor technology have short
battery life (e.g. 5 h [11]) and are available in a limited number of insole sizes/shapes
(e.g. 6 sizes [12]). Moreover, the performance of smart insoles is directly linked to
the number and distribution of the sensors integrated as well as the identiﬁcation
of optimal sensor locations that match areas subject to the highest plantar pressures
during gait or standing. These locations can vary depending on the foot sizes and gait
patterns of different users and can therefore alter or limit the gait or standing event
recognition accuracy. Finally, high sensor responsivity which is the fundamental
indicator to ensure a prompt real-time detection of speciﬁc biomechanically-relevant
gait and standing events and a timely and synchronous action of the linked wearable
device, multiple sensor signals as well as information related to the interaction with
the external environment are necessary but not always achievable.
Biomaterials, such as mycelium bound composites, present a promising alterna-
tive to conventional smart insoles. They exhibit sensing and responsive capabilities
without requiring additional space (for support infrastructure) and external inputs
(e.g., electrical power sources) to operate, using its own bioelectric activity. Fun-
gal sensors offer increased biodegradability, they are self- sustainable as they can

self-grow, self-repair and self-assemble, they are abundant and offer in situ low tech-
nology cultivation. Moreover, they present low capital requirements and are easily
scalable for the production of customised insole sizes.
In our previous studies, we demonstrated that living blocks of colonised by ﬁl-
amentous polypore fungus Ganoderma resinaceum substrate (MOGU’s collection
code 19-18, Mogu S.r.l., Inarzo, Italy), showed immediate responses in the form of
spikes of electrical potential when subjected to weight application (8 kg and 16 kg),
recognising the application or removal of weight [13]. We present an illustrative
scoping study in which we research the response of mycelium composite insoles to
pressure generated by the feet during gait or standing. The primary objective of the
studies reported in this paper is to assess the performance and spiking activity of the
fungal insoles when exposed to mechanical stimuli and in particular, weight shifting
(shifting of weight from toe to heel). We present a prototype of pressure-sensitive
fungal insoles, aiming to open up opportunities for further research and discussions
on the novel ﬁeld of responsive smart insoles from living material, with the objec-
tive of enabling real-time applications and providing a sustainable, cost efﬁcient and
accurate tool for posture, gait and activity recognition events.

Methods
A method of forming insoles colonised with fungi from capillary matting (rather
than hemp) was developed through multiple iterations. 200 g slab of mixed (mostly
Rye grain) seed substrate well colonised with Pleurotus ostreatus (Ann Miller’s Spe-
ciality Mushrooms, UK, https://www.annforfungi.co.uk/shop/oyster-grain-spawn/)
was placed in the bottom of clean plastic container (5l, 280 × 145 × 110 mm,
Amazon, UK). Multi-layered, absorbent, capillary action matting, c. 3 mm thick-
ness, made from bonded, non-toxic, wool and acrylic ﬁbres, 450gm−(manufactured
by Tech-Garden, UK) was manually cut into the shape of insoles (UK ladies size
10) using hemp scissors (manufactured by Pemmiproducts, Germany), see Fig. 1a.
The bespoke insole was sprayed with deionized water (15 M cm, model Essen-
tial, Millipore, UK) and placed on spawn bed, see Fig. 1b. The plastic container
was placed inside a polypropylene bag (type 14A) ﬁtted with 0.5µm air ﬁlter patch
(Ann Miller’s Speciality Mushrooms, UK) and sealed with food storage clip (model
Bevara, IKEA, UK). The insole was kept at ambient room temperature 18 ◦C to 22 ◦C
inside a growth tent (in darkness). The insole was checked for growth every 3 days
and additional moisture added (via manual water spray bottle) as required. After c.
3 weeks, uniform mycelium growth throughout the capillary matting was observed,
see Fig. 1b. The colonised insole was carefully lifted off the spawn bed, see Fig. 1c.
A bespoke test rig was developed to apply compressive loading to insoles to repli-
cate the weight of a human when walking and standing. A prosthetic foot (ladies,
UK size 10) was 3D printed in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (with Ultimaker S5,
UK), see Fig. 2. The top part of the prosthetic foot was intentionally printed ﬂat.
A pivot joint (with integrated locking mechanism) was positioned between the weight

Fig. 1 a Capillary matting cut into insole pattern b insole on bed of spawn c well colonised insole
and aluminium plate on top of the prosthetic foot to provide control over how the
compressive load was distributed across the insole, see Fig. 2b. Test rig frame was
assembled from plywood sheet (18mm thickness) with plastic pipe (110mm diam-
eter). Mild steel bar (100mm diameter) was free to move vertically inside the pipe
to provide compressive loading on the insole at the bottom. For example, 500mm
length of steel bar weighs 37kg which approximates a woman (with size 10 feet)
standing on two feet (two 500mm lengths can be used to replicate standing on one
foot). The weight(s) could be raised and locked in the retracted position (by manual
winch, ﬁtted with a ratchet locking mechanism) to enable insoles to be interchanged
and the load varied. To prevent the colonised insole slowly dehydrating over time
(which might affect measurements) a sheet of capillary matting was placed under the
insole, see Fig. 2a. The end of the capillary matting was left in a tray of de-ionised
water which provided a source of moisture.
Three modes of compressive loading were explored (i) toe bias, Fig. 2d (ii) heel
bias, Fig. 2c and (iii) uniformly distributed, Fig. 2b.
Electrical activity of the mycelium colonising insoles was recorded using eight
pairs of stainless steel sub-dermal needle electrodes (Spes Medica S.r.l., Italy), with
twisted cables and ADC-24 (PICO Technology, UK) high-resolution data logger with
a 24-bit A/D converter, galvanic isolation and software-selectable sample rates. The
pairs of electrodes were pierced through the insole’s edge as shown in Fig. 2. We
recorded electrical activity one sample per second. During the recording, the logger
has been doing as many measurements as possible (typically up to 10 per second) and
saving the average value. We set the acquisition voltage range to 156 mV. Each pair

of electrodes, called a channel (Ch), reported a difference of the electrical potential
between the electrodes. Distance between electrodes was 1 to 2cm.
Numerical modelling of the electrical activity was implemented as follows.
We used an artistic image of the mycelium network (Fig. 3a) projected onto a
364 × 985nodesgrid.Theoriginalimage M = (mi j)1≤j≤ni,1≤j≤n j ,mi j ∈{ri j, gi j, bi j},
where ni = 364 and n j = 985, and 1 ≤r, g, b ≤255 (Fig. 3a), was converted to a
conductive matrix C = (mi j)1≤i, j≤n (Fig. 3b) derived from the image as follows:
mi j = 1 if ri j > 170, gi j > 170 and bi j < 200; a dilution operation was applied to
C.
FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) equations [14–16] is a qualitative approximation of the
Hodgkin-Huxley model [17] of electrical activity of living cells:
∂v
∂t = c1u(u −a)(1 −u) −c2uv + I + Du∇2
(1)
∂v
∂t = b(u −v),
(2)
where u is a value of a trans-membrane potential, v a variable accountable for a total
slow ionic current, or a recovery variable responsible for a slow negative feedback, I
is a value of an external stimulation current. The current through intra-cellular spaces
is approximated by Du∇2, where Du is a conductance. Detailed explanations of the
‘mechanics’ of the model are provided in [18], here we shortly repeat some insights.

The term Du∇2u governs a passive spread of the current. The terms c2u(u −a)(1 −
u) and b(u −v) describe the ionic currents. The term u(u −a)(1 −u) has two stable
ﬁxed points u = 0 and u = 1 and one unstable point u = a, where a is a threshold
of an excitation.
We integrated the system using the Euler method with the ﬁve-node Laplace
operator, a time step t = 0.015 and a grid point spacing x = 2, while other
parameters were Du = 1, a = 0.13, b = 0.013, c1 = 0.26. We controlled excitability
of the medium by varying c2 from 0.05 (fully excitable) to 0.015 (non excitable).

To record dynamics of excitation in the network, as if in laboratory experiments,
we simulated electrodes by calculating a potential pt

To imitate a pressure onto insole we perturbed the medium around electrodes E1
or E2 or both.
Time-lapse snapshots provided were recorded at every 100th time step, and we
display sites with u > 0.04; videos and ﬁgures were produced by saving a frame
of the simulation every 100th step of the numerical integration and assembling the

Results
Electrical activity was recorded for c. 30 min immediately before, c. 30 min during
and c. 30 min immediately after35kg was evenly distributed across the insole, see
Fig. 4.
Electrical activity was recorded for ∼24min immediately before 35kg was evenly
distributed across the insole for c. 72min. The prosthetic foot was then tilted back to
bias the weight onto the heel region of the insole c. 24min. The prosthetic foot was
then tilted forward to bias the weight onto the toe region of the insole for c. 24 min.
Finally, the weight was removed for c. 24min. Eight pairs of needle electrodes were
distributed along the side of the insole as shown in Fig. 5.
When a small area, c. 10 nodes, is perturbed the excitation starts propagating
along the simulated mycelium network (Fig. 6ab). With time, typically after 50K-
60K iterations of the integration, the excitation wave fronts span all the mycelium
network (Fig. 6cde). Due to inhomogeneity of the network source so the spiral waves
are formed. They become sources of oscillatory excitations. Repeated propagation
of the spiral waves is reﬂected in the oscillatory activity levels on the mycelium
network (Fig. 7).
Is it possible to discern what loci of the insole a pressure was applied based on
electrical activity of the mycelium network? Yes, as we demonstrate further. Let
us start with activity. As evidenced in Fig. 7 the overall activity of the mycelium
network depends on the site of pressure application (as imitated via exciting areas
around electrodes E1 or E2 or both). When consider the three possible scenarios of
Fig. 4 Electrical activity (recorded on Ch 1–2, Ch 3–4, Ch 7–8, Ch 9–10) before, during and after
load (35kg) was evenly distributed across insole

Fig. 6 Snapshots of the excitation dynamics of the mycelium network colonising the insole. Area
around electrode E1 has been excited originally
the stimulation, the overall activity is lowest when area around electrode E2 is excited
(E1 = 0, E2 = 1). This is due to relatively lower number of mycelium strands in that
part of the insole. The overall activity increases in the scenario where area round E1
is excited (E1 = 1, E2 = 0). And the highest level of overall activity is evidenced
for the scenario when areas around both electrodes (E1 = 1, E2 = 1).
Coverage frequency could be another indicator to discern geometry of pressure.
A coverage frequency at node x is a number of iterations values of excitation variable
ux exceeded 0.1, normalised by maximum coverage frequency amongst the nodes.
The coverage frequency is illustrated in Fig. 8. The coverage frequency is maximum
around the areas of pressure application and might even reﬂect a distance, not an

unique representations of the geometries of pressure applications. The formal rep-
resentation of the spiking patterns could be done by distributions of Boolean gates
in the spiking activity. This original technique has been developed by us in frame-
works of cytoskeleton networks [19], fungal colony [20] and ensemble of proteinoid
microspheres [21].
A spiking activity of the mycelium network shown in Fig. 9 in a response to
stimulation, i.e. application of inputs (E1, E2) = {(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)} via impulses
at the electrodes E1 and E2, recorded from electrodes E1, . . . , E12. We assume
that each spike represents logical True and that spikes occurring within less than
2 · 102 iterations are simultaneous. Then a representation of gates by spikes and
their combinations can be implemented as shown in Table 1. By selecting speciﬁc
intervals of recordings we can realise several gates in a single site of recording.
In this particular case we assumed that spikes are separated if their occurrences are
more than 103 iterations apart. In the simulated scenarios, we found that the following
Boolean functions can be implemented on the electrodes E1, . . . , E12. Three or gates
are realised on electrodes E3, E8 and E12. Ten Selecty, where y=true signiﬁes
initial excitation around electrode E2, are realised on electrodes E3 and E12. Fifty
Selectx, where x=true signiﬁes initial excitation around electrode E1, are realised
on the electrodes but E1, E9 and E11. Five not-and gate, in the form not x and y,
are realised on electrodes E2, E9 and E10. The implementation of logical functions on
the electrodes will allow for logical inference about geometries of pressure applied
to insoles.

Discussion
Initial testing of insoles made of other materials (not reported here) conﬁrmed the
necessity to use a material compatible with the biological organism being utilised.
For example, off-the-shelf hemp insoles (sourced from six different manufacturers)
showed poor fungal colonisation (possibly due to unknown chemical processes to
minimise bacterial growth which could lead to undesirable foot wear odour). Fur-
ther testing of bespoke insoles cut from non-woven hemp matting (manufactured by
Pemmiproducts, Germany) showed improved colonisation by fungi but inconsistent
electrical activity (possibly due to inconsistent moisture level) and weak mechani-
cal robustness. Following a process of trial and error with different materials over
several months, capillary matting was identiﬁed as a strong candidate for the desired
functionality.
It was observed that the risk of unwanted bacterial infection during colonisation of
the insole could be reduced by keeping the insole inside a sealed local environment
(for example, plastic bag ﬁtted with sub-micron air ﬁlter) that mitigates airborne
infection. Additionally, enclosing in a bag helps to prevent the insole dehydrating by
maintaining a high local air humidity. Keeping the insole in darkness or low intensity
light encourages its colonisation.
Optionally, forming the insole from two sheets of capillary matting allows a
sandwich to be formed with nutrient layer (such as Rye grain seeds) between the top
and bottom layer. This can allow the fungi to remain active for longer. Insoles infused
with ﬂour paste were prone to infection (even with sterilisation via autoclave).
The large internal volume and porous seals (long fabric zips) on the growth tent
containing test rig was prone to low humidity, even with an open container of water
present. It was found adding a sheet of capillary matting under the insole, see Fig. 2a,
helped to maintain an adequate moisture level in the insole for fungal activity. The
end of the sheet was left in a tray of de-ionised water which provided a source of
moisture.
Oscillations in plant membrane are already know [22]. The physiological role of
such oscillations has been the subject of much speculation. It has been hypothesised
these oscillations are links to plants’ adaptive response to environmental stresses [23].
The number of spikes (<0.1mV) recorded over three c. 30 min periods before,
during after even compressive load are summarised in Table
2. Further, it was
observed that periodicity of electrical spikes changed when the mycelium was under
compressive load.
Measurements indicate a layer of mycelium integrated into an insole shows elec-
trical response to mechanical stimulation with change in oscillatory activity. In par-
ticular, the number of spikes increases under compressive load. The response to
removing weight is different to applying weight.
To examine this response in more detail, the distribution of the weight across
the insole was varied and applied in different regions (i.e., toe, heel, whole). That
was designed in order to be similar to the way people change their weight distri-
bution from heel to toe while walking. The number of spikes in each time period

were automatically counted by utilising SciPy, an open-source collection containing
mathematical algorithms and functions built on an extension of Python (https://docs.
scipy.org). In speciﬁc, the function ﬁnd_peaks was utilised to identify peaks with a
prominence of 0.03 mV for this application. Then, a custom program was developed
in Python to calculate the time difference between two spikes. Histograms of the
distribution of time differences between spikes in each insole region under no load,
heel biased and toe biased load were produced and they were drawn over the same
axes to allow the comparison of the results as shown in Fig. 10. Data visualization
software Tableau was used to identify the potential (mV) differences under no load,
even load, heel biased and toe biased load for every channel separately as shown in
Fig. 11. The amplitude of spikes decreases under even load application compared to
no load application. No conclusions could be made regarding the electrical activity
under heel biased and toe biased load. It was therefore, not possible to accurately
discern the distribution of compressive loading across the insole from analysis of
electrical responses.
Experimentation identiﬁed the rate of occurrence of spikes is lower than desirable
to accurately infer the weight bearing when walking. However, when standing for
a period, electrical activity can be collected and analysed to infer weight bearing
which can be used for anatomical diagnostics [24, 25]. Continuous monitoring of feet
could offer numerous medical/health beneﬁts [26–28]. For example, early detection
of health related conditions (such as knee injury) or tiredness. It can also be useful
for sports training [29–31].
In the experimental setup described, sensory mapping is limited to ‘1.5D’ (8 pairs
of differential electrodes in a row and limited vertical motion) however this could
be expanded to ‘2.5D’ by mapping with a 2D distributed array of electrodes across
the insole. For example, needle electrodes replaced by thin/ﬂexible wires integrated
into the capillary matting such that uninsulated sections of the wires are spatially
distributed and electrical connections are realised to the edge of the insole.
Direct conversion of mechanical energy into electricity offers potential as power
source for various systems [32–34].
It was observed during the fabrication and testing of a diverse range of prototype
wearables (including clothing) that capillary matting offer superior durability over
hemp matting (in particular on ﬂexible clothing joints, knees and elbows) and easy of

tion wave-fronts behave in a mycelium network colonising an insole and shown that
it is possible to discern pressure points from the mycelium electrical activity.

Conclusion
Electrical activity (spiking) was recorded in mycelium bound composites fabri-
cated into insoles. The number and periodicity of electrical spikes change when
the mycelium is subjected to compressive loading. We have shown that it might be
possible to discern the loading from the electrical response of the fungi to stim-
uli. The results advance the development of intelligent sensing insoles which are a
building block towards more generic reactive fungal wearables. Electrical activity
changes in both spatial and temporal domains. Using FitzhHugh-Nagumo model
we numerically illustrated how excitation wave-fronts behave in a mycelium net-
work colonising an insole and shown that it might be possible to discern pressure
points from the mycelium electrical activity. Fungal based insoles offer augmented
functionality (sensory) and aesthetic (personal fashion).

Electrical Response of Fungi to Changing
Moisture Content
Neil Phillips, Antoni Gandia, and Andrew Adamatzky
Abstract Mycelium-bound composites are potential alternatives to conventional
materials for a variety of applications, including thermal and acoustic building panels
and product packaging. If the reactions of live mycelium to environmental condi-
tions and stimuli are taken into account, it is possible to create functioning fungal
materials. Thus, active building components, sensory wearables, etc. might be cre-
ated. This research describes the electrical sensitivity of fungus to changes in the
moisture content of a mycelium-bound composite. Trains of electrical spikes ini-
tiate spontaneously in fresh mycelium-bound composites with a moisture content
between ∼95 and ∼65%, and between ∼15 and ∼5% when partially dried. When
the surfaces of mycelium-bound composites were partially or totally encased with
an impermeable layer, increased electrical activity was observed. In fresh mycelium-
bound composites, electrical spikes were seen both spontaneously and when induced
by water droplets on the surface. Also explored is the link between electrical activity
and electrode depth. Future designs of smart buildings, wearables, fungi-based sen-
sors, and unconventional computer systems may beneﬁt from fungi conﬁgurations
and biofabrication ﬂexibility.

Introduction
Mycelium-bound composites—masses of organic substrates colonised by fungi—are
consideredenvironmentallyfriendlybiodegradablebiomaterials[1–4].Thesefungal-
based materials can be used in thermal insulation wall cladding [5–10], acoustic
insulation panels [11–13], packaging materials [14–16], wearables [1, 17–22], art
[23, 24], and interior design [24, 25]. Fungi are frugal colonisers and are found in
most habitats on Earth wherever there is a minimal moisture availability. Remarkably,

theycanthriveindesertedareasthankstosymbioticrelationshipswithphotosynthetic
organisms like algae and plants. To this day, most fungal materials are ﬁnished and
served in a dehydrated form that stops all biological activity throughout the substrate
and avoids the eventual regrowth, sporulation, or further decay of the pieces and
derived bioburden [12, 26]. Furthermore, downstream preservation techniques such
as paint coatings and plasticisation are commonly used to extend the lifespan of these
biomaterials to properly ﬁt their functional and commercial purpose as decorative or
architectural elements.
Contrary to common practice, in [27] we proposed to develop a structural sub-
strate by using non-dehydrated living fungal mycelium, functionalise the substrate
with nanoparticles and polymers to make mycelium-based electronics [28–31], and
implement sensorial fusion and decision making in the mycelium networks [32].
Following that vision, the structural substrate—the living mycelium-bound compos-
ites — will be used to grow monolithic buildings from the functionalised fungal
substrate [33]. Buildings grown with mycelium-bound composites could provide
intelligent sensory capability if some parts of the mycelium remain alive, therefore
securing a minimal viable moisture content will be crucial to keep the sensorial net-
work of the fungus electrically active. In this case the fungal materials might be able
to detect structural loads (dead loads such as the weight of the structure, live loads
such as vehicle trafﬁc, building contents, etc, and environmental loads such as wind,
snow, etc) [34], illumination [31], temperature, and air pollution.
As part of our research into the sensing characteristics of fungus, we demonstrate
how mycelium-bound composites respond to variations in moisture content by mod-
ifying their electrical activity. We chose electrical activity as an indicator of fungal
response because fungi have been shown to respond to chemical and physical stimuli
by changing patterns of electrical activity [35–37] and electrical properties [31].

Methods and Materials
Blocks of spawn substrate were bought from commercial suppliers. They were made
of rye seeds and millet grain and were well colonised with two types of fungi:
Hericium erinaceus (supplied by Urban Farm It Ltd, UK, product code M9514) and
Pleurotus ostreatus (supplied by Mycelia BVBA, BE, product code M2125).
A moisture probe (HOBO EC-5, Tempcon Instrumentation Ltd, UK) was inserted
into blocks of colonised substrate and connected to a data logger (HOBO H21 USB
Micro Station, Tempcon Instrumentation Ltd, UK). Every ten seconds, the electrical
conductivity between the probe’s two electrodes was measured and saved (using
HOBOware Pro Software from Tempcon Instrumentation Ltd, UK) on a Windows
10 computer for later analysis, see Fig. 1.
The following steps were taken to calibrate the moisture probe: (1) The sample is
weighed, and the electrical conductivity between the probe electrodes is measured.
(2) The sample is dried in an oven at at 80 ◦C for ∼48 h. The sample is weighed again,
and then the electrical conductivity between the probe electrodes is measured while

the sample is ‘bone dry.’ (4) The difference in weight and electrical conductivity
between the two situations is calculated.
A freshly unwrapped (∼500g) block of substrate (rye seeds and millet grain)
that had been colonised by Pleurotus ostreatus was left to slowly dehydrate at room
temperature (18 ◦C to22 ◦C) and ambient humidity (∼30%). A calibrated HOBO EC-
5 moisture probe was used to monitore the substrate’s moisture content (as previously
described). A high-resolution data logger with a 24-bit A/D converter (ADC-24,
PICO Technology, UK) and software (PicoLog 6, PICO Technology, UK) with a
selectable sample rate and pairs of stainless steel sub-dermal needle electrodes were
used to record electrical activity (Spes Medica S.r.l., IT). The sampling period was
one second, which was used to record electrical activity. During the recording, the
logger took as many measurements as it could (usually up to 600 per second) and
saved the average value. The voltage range for acquisition was set to ±39 mV.
Each pair of electrodes, called a channel (Ch), reported a difference in the electrical
potential between them. The electrodes were pierced through the mycelium on the
substrate’s surface. The distance between electrodes was 1–2cm, see Fig. 1.
In a different experiment, a fresh block (∼500g) of substrate (rye grain seeds and
millet grain) that had been colonised by Pleurotus ostreatus was left partly wrapped
inside the plastic bag it was supplied in. The top of the bag was left open so that the
substrate could slowly lose its moisture content. Subdermal needle electrodes with
a length of 18mm length were pushed through the plastic bag and ∼15mm into the
body of the substrate.
5l bag of substrate (rye and millet grain seed) well colonised with Ganoderma
lucidum (manufactured by Mycelia BVBA, product code M97261) was divided into
the following ten samples (plus waste):

• 1 collection of fruiting bodies (50g), sample ‘E’, see Fig. 2b.
• 4 sub-blocks with substrate exposed surface (80g each), samples ‘F’, ‘G’, ‘H’, ‘I’,
see Fig. 2c.
• 1 collection of substrate fragmented into loose seeds (80g), sample ‘J’
Each portion was put in a 2l, plastic container with a removable airtight lid (model
1720ZS KLIP IT, Sistema, NZ). The divider in the middle allows air ﬂow between
the two sides. On the other side, two 50g sachets of dry silica gel (model WD-1,
Viola Technology Ltd, UK) that could hold more than 30 g of water together were
put, as shown in the bottom half of Fig. 2. The weight of silica gel was recorded daily
for 41 days.
Three conﬁgurations of electrodes were used to record electrical activity at dif-
ferent depths in mycelium-bound composite:
1. unmodiﬁed sub-dermal needle electrodes (18mm length) inserted ∼15mm depth
into body of spawn substrate, see Fig. 3a.
2. unmodiﬁed sub-dermal needle electrodes inserted through 20mm thick foam
spacer so inserted ∼3mm depth into mycelium, see Fig. 3b.
3. sub-dermal needle electrodes partly electrically insulated (with 16mm of heat
shrink tubing) inserted ∼18mm into body of spawn substrate to make electrical
contact ∼16 to 18mm below surface, see Fig. 3c.
Samples of spawn substrate blocks (with a myceliated surface) were taken out of
their dehydration containers and the electrical activity was measured with stainless
steel sub-dermal needle electrodes, see Fig. 4b, and a data logger (ADC-24, PICO
Technology Ltd, UK). For experimental ﬂexibility and consistency, recordings were
made inside a custom-made environmental chamber, as shown in Fig. 4a. Tempera-
ture control (e.g. 10± 1oC) was done with a digital thermostat that controlled how the
cooling compressor worked. The temperature and humidity inside the chamber were

in the environmental chamber was raised to ∼75% using an ultrasonic humidiﬁer
(3 l Silent, Hffheer Ltd.) ﬁlled with deionised water and activated for 15 min every
3 h, see Figs. 4 and 5.
In a separate experiment, a fresh block of substrate (1l bag) that had been well
colonised with Pleurotus ostreatus was taken out of the bag and left to dry in the air.
To record electrical activity, (18mm length) needle electrodes were inserted ∼15mm
below the skin. After 24 h, the surface of the mycelium was sprayed by hand with
de-ionised water. The results are shown in Results shown in Fig. 13.
In a different experiment, to make sure that water on the surface of the mycelium
didn’t change the electricity conductivity between the electrodes, a block of substrate
that hadbeenwell colonisedwithPleurotus ostreatus was left insideaplasticbagwith
only the top part of the bag open so it could slowly dry out. Eight pairs of subdermal
needle electrodes (18mm length) were inserted (15mm) through the sides of the

An exemplar of electrical activity against moisture content in partly wrapped block

spontaneously spike trains are recorded from the start and ceased after ∼20 h at
which time the moisture content has dropped to <∼70%.

The rate of water loss from substrate colonised with fungi and fruiting bodies in low
humidity air against time is shown in Fig. 9. To simplify the comparison, the rate
of water loss from fruiting bodies was adjusted pro rota (x1.6) to compensate for a
smaller sample mass (50g rather than 80g).

Discussion
Obtaining fresh blocks (∼500g) of electrically active spawn substrate from com-
mercial suppliers at desired times was challenging (e.g. limited stock availability,
some blocks didn’t show electrical activity). Further, most commercial suppliers
were unwilling to provide details of substrate composition (beyond “rye or mil-
let seeds” as considered a ‘trade secret’). Therefore, variation in substrate might
exist between both batches from the same supplier and different suppliers. Further,
the level of colonisation of blocks varied greatly between suppliers and times of

recordings as the fungi consumed the substrate as a source of nutrients. Additionally,
the heterogeneous mixture of substrate and fungi added an additional variable.
Despite an extensive search, no commercial available moisture probe calibrated
for substrate colonised with fungi was found. Therefore, it was necessary to calibrate
a general-purpose moisture probe for this purpose. Moisture probe HOBO EC-5 and
H21 Micro Station from Tempcon Instrumentation Ltd were selected and readings
were calibrated by weighting samples before and after oven drying to determine
water content. The large physical size of the EC-5 probes meant blocks of spawn

160

Fig. 14 Exemplar of electrical activity before, during and after manually spraying water droplets
onto the surface of mycelium inside the bag (after spontaneous spike trains ceased)
substrate needed to be sufﬁciently large (e.g. 500g) to avoid them splitting when the
EC-5 probes were inserted into them (which would have interfered with electrical
conductivity measurements).
An electrical path from the EC-5 probes via HOBO H21 Micro Station to the data
logging computer appeared to interfere with the recording of electrical potentials
made with PICO ADC-24. Therefore, it was necessary to unplug the USB connection
between HOBO H21 Micro Station and computer during recordings (utilising Micro
Station internally batteries for power).
The initial moisture content of fresh spawn substrate blocks (as supplied) is high
(typically 80–100%) over time (several days) in low humidity air (∼30% relative
humidity) the moisture content reduces signiﬁcantly (<20%). The drying curves of
colonised substrate were found to be similar to organic material (such as seeds and
vegetables) dehydrating in air [38–41].
Electricalspikeswerenotinitiallyrecordedinunwrappedfreshblocksofcolonised
substrate. For example, see Fig. 7. However, as the moisture content dropped (e.g.
<20%) the fungi become stressed and spikes spontaneously initiated (e.g. 3 ±3 h−1).
After a further period of dehydration, the rate spikes decreased and ﬁnally ceased
(e.g. ∼64 h).
Partly wrapped fresh blocks of colonised substrate typically exhibit markedly dif-
ferent electrical characteristics. For example, Fig. 8 shows a partly wrapped block
of substrate colonised with Pleurotus ostreatus dehydrating. In this example, spon-
taneously spike trains are recorded from the start and ceased after ∼20 h at which
time the moisture content has dropped to <∼70%.
The rates of dehydration shown in Figs. 7 and 8 against time are different as the
latter is partly enclosed in an (open) plastic bag which slows the rate of water loss
from the block.

Electrical Response of Fungi to Changing Moisture Content

Oscillations in plant membrane are already known [42].
The rate of water loss from fruiting bodies was considerably higher (40–60%)
than substrate both with and without mycelium skin. This suggests that linear cyto-
plasmic units [43, 44] are drawing water near the surface which increases the rate
of evaporation (in an environment with low-humidity air). The rate of water loss
from the substrate with a mycelium skin became increasingly higher (10–60%) than
substrate without mycelium skin.
Initially, the rate of water loss from the fragmented substrate (mostly loose rye
and millet grain seeds) was slightly higher than the average substrate both with and
without mycelium skin. However, over time this situation reversed and the rate of
water loss become slightly lower than the average substrate both with and without
mycelium skin. This suggests that the greater surface area of the fragmented substrate
becomes less important as the substrate’s moisture content is reduced close to bone
dry.
After ∼35d the measured rate of ‘water loss’ levelled off which suggests the
remaining measurement of weight gain was water absorbed from the ambient air
when the plastic enclosures were opened to remove the sachets of silica gel for
weighing. Measuring the weight of the silica gel (rather than directly weighting the
sample) provides several advantages including no loss of material or infection of the
sample during the weighting process.
Recordings of electrical activity measured just below the surface (0–3mm) typi-
cally contain higher potential differences than those recorded across a broader depth
(0 to 15mm) inside the block, as shown in Fig. 10. This difference is also noticeable
in recordings electrodes inserted 0 to 15mm compared to 16 to 18mm. For example,
Ch 1–2 and 3–4 compared to Ch 9–10 and 11–12 in Fig. 11. This suggests that elec-
trical potential is discharged by electrodes making electrical connections to others
parts of the block which are less electrically active. In other words, the high elec-
trical conductivity of the metal electrodes discharges voltage differential as current
through other low conductivity parts of the block.
Inserting sub-dermal needles at a signiﬁcant depth (e.g. 15mm) into the colonised
substrate provides mechanical support to hold the electrodes in position. If sub-
dermal needles are only inserted a shallow depth (e.g. 3mm) then any movement of
the ﬂying leads can disturb the connection between the electrode and mycelium. To
overcome this issue, a foam spacer was ﬁrst glued to the surface of the plastic bag
containing the spawn substrate. Unmodiﬁed sub-dermal needles were then inserted
through 20mm thick foam spacer to securely positioned them ∼3mm depth into
mycelium. Other methods of securing the electrodes’ positions (e.g. holding the top
of the electrodes with a frame rigid relative to the block, electrically insulating the
bottom part of the needle and inserting further into the substrate, etc) are possible.
Electrical potential was also observed to vary with electrode separation. A distance
of ∼20mm between centres of electrodes was found to be effective for monitoring
electrical activity, as was evidenced by the identiﬁcation of signiﬁcantly more and
larger spikes in the recordings. This suggests that there is an optimum spacing for
the electrodes in any environment.

162
N. Phillips et al.
Optimising the relative physical positions of electrodes in colonised substrate
(in terms of both depth and spacing) is important to maximising the sensitivity of
monitoring and interconnections to other systems.
Figure 12 shows water droplets condensing on the surface of mycelium from the
high humidity air (in this example from the ultrasonic humidiﬁer) can trigger trains
of electrical spikes. Spikes of diminishing electrical potential continue to occur for
∼2h after the humidiﬁer is switched off.
Infreshspawnsubstrate, spikes caninitiatebothspontaneouslyand/or betriggered
by water droplets on the surface in mycelium. For example, in Fig. 13, trains of
spikes (∼3mV peak) trigger spontaneously ∼10 h period. Spraying with de-ionised
water triggers a spike train of twice the voltage potential (∼6mV peak). Electrical
potential in fruiting bodies with precipitation has been reported [45]. The inﬂuence
of environmental conditions on the electrical activity of fruiting bodies has been
reported [46].
If the spawn substrate is allowed to partly dehydrate, spontaneous spike trains
cease. However, electrical response (non-spike train) to water droplets still occurs.
Exemplar Fig. 14 shows signiﬁcant electrical pulses (∼15mV peak), most pulses
contain two peaks, the initial one is larger followed (∼15s later) by a second peak.
If the spawn substrate is allowed to completely dehydrate, no electrical response to
water droplets on the surface of mycelium occurs.

Conclusions
Electrical activity in fresh well colonised substrate is signiﬁcantly greater if part or
all of the surface is enclosed with an impermeable layer (e.g. ﬂexible plastic bag
or rigid plastic container). For example, trains of electrical spikes initiate sponta-
neously in fresh spawn substrate blocks with >∼65% moisture content inside an
(open) plastic bag. If the substrate is unwrapped and allowed to partly dehydrate
spikes can spontaneously occur at <∼15% moisture content. The rate of change of
moisture content in the substrate is affected by how well the substrate’s surface is
colonised with fungi. In particular, the higher the proportion of the surface covered
with fungi the quicker the substrate dehydrates. In fresh spawn, electrical spikes can
initiate both spontaneously and/or be triggered by water droplets on the surface in
the mycelium. If the spawn is allowed to partly dehydrate, spontaneous spike trains
cease. However, electrical response (non-spike train) to water droplets can still occur.
The versatility of fungi, in terms of being able to tailor different biofabricated con-
ﬁgurations such as composites, ﬂexible tissue, rhizomorphs, and foamy materials,
provides a promising opportunity for the development of unconventional comput-
ing systems. The suitability of utilising fungi for particular applications needs to be
carefully assessed (e.g. quantitative analysis of the selected species) as some fungi
form mycotoxins or might become invasive species [47].

Electrical Resistive Spiking of Fungi
Andrew Adamatzky, Alessandro Chiolerio, and Georgios Sirakoulis
Abstract We study long-term electrical resistance dynamics in mycelium and fruit
bodies of oyster fungi P. ostreatus. A nearly homogeneous sheet of mycelium on the
surface of a growth substrate exhibits trains of resistance spikes. The average width
of spikes is c. 23 min and the average amplitude is c. 1 k. The distance between
neighbouring spikes in a train of spikes is c. 30 min. Typically there are 4–6 spikes
in a train of spikes. Two types of electrical resistance spikes trains are found in fruit
bodies: low frequency and high amplitude (28 min spike width, 1.6 k amplitude,
57 min distance between spikes) and high frequency and low amplitude (10 min
width, 0.6 k amplitude, 44 min distance between spikes). The ﬁndings could be
applied in monitoring of physiological states of fungi and future development of
living electronic devices and sensors.

Introduction
Electrical resistance of living substrates is used to identify their morphological and
physiological state [1–5]. Examples include determination of states of organs [6],
detection of decaying wood in living trees [7, 8], estimation of roots vigour [9], study
of freeze-thaw injuries of plants [10], as well as classiﬁcation of breast tissue [11].
The aim of this study is two-fold.
First aim is to study the dynamics of the fungal electrical resistance during long-
term (up to two days of intermittent measurements). Whilst resistive properties of
plants and mammals tissue have been studied extensively, results on electrical resis-
tance of fungi are absent. This gap should be properly ﬁlled because the fungi is

the largest, widely distributed and the oldest group of living organisms [12]. Fungi
“possess almost all the senses used by humans” [13]: they can sense light, chemicals,
gases, gravity and electric ﬁelds. Fungi show a pronounced response to changes in a
substratepH[14],demonstratemechanosensing[15]andsensingoftoxicmetals[16],
CO2 [17], and chemical cues, especially stress hormones, from other species [18].
Thus mycelium networks can be used as large-scale distributed sensors. To prototype
fungal sensing networks we should know their electrical features and resistance is
deﬁnitely one of these characteristics.
Second aim is to assess whether fungi can be employed as electronic oscilla-
tors. The application domain of the fungal electronic oscillators could be the ﬁeld
of unconventional computing [19], especially in the framework of organic electron-
ics, living sensor and living computing wetware. Feasibility studies with plants [20,
21], slime mould [22–25] and fungi [26] have shown that it is possible to develop
electrical analog computing circuits either based or with these living creatures. Bio-
logical molecules such as suine microtubules have been shown to enable very fast
oscillations, in the tents of MHz range [27]. However, to have a full functional ana-
log computer, we probably need an oscillator. As Horowitz and Hill reported—“A
device without an oscillator either doesn’t do anything or expects to be driven by
something else (which probably contains an oscillator)” [28]. Thus, we envisage that
the resistive spiking can be utilised to produce fungal electronic oscillators.

Methods
Oyster fungi P. ostreatus have been cultivated on hemp substrate in plastic containers
in darkness and at ambient temperature 20–23 ◦C. We used the substrate after it was
nearly fully colonised by mycelium, which was indicated by an almost everywhere
white colour and white ﬁlm of nearly homogeneous mycelium, sometimes called
‘skin’ on surface of the substrate that was formed. The electrical resistance of the skin
was measured as follows. We used iridium-coated stainless steel sub-dermal needle
electrodes (Spes Medica S.r.l., Italy), with twisted cables. The pairs of electrodes
were inserted in fungal skin, while the distance between electrodes was kept 1 cm
(Fig.1a). Twelve trials of measurements were undertaken with fungal skin. In six
trials, we also undertook recordings of the fruit body’s resistance, where electrodes
were inserted in stalks of the bodies (Fig.1b). The resistance was measured using the
Kelvin, or 4-wire, resistance measurement method (Fig.1c) and logged using Fluke
8846A precision multimeter, the test current being 1±0.0013 µA (each measurement
taken in less than 10 ms) once per 10 s, 5 · 104 samples per trial. When characterising
trainsofspikes,wemeasuredspikeaveragewidthw,averageamplitudea andaverage
distance between spikes d. To check if there are potential oscillations of voltage
applied to the fungi, we applied direct current voltage with GW Instek GPS-1850D
laboratory DC power supply and measured voltage with Fluke 8846A (Fig.1d).

Results
The resistance of fungal mycelium exhibits very slow, 1.5 · 104–3 · 104 s, disor-
dered changes of the resistance values with trains of spikes, of increased resistance,
emerging. An example of the long-term recording is shown in Fig.2a and a train of
spikes in Fig.2b. In over 16 trials we inferred the following parameters of spikes:
w = 1380 s (median 1190 s, σ = 77), a = 1,036  (median 815 , σ = 674),
d = 1830 s (median 175 s, σ = 87). Spike width versus amplitude distribution is
shown in Fig.2c.
Two trials of the resistance recording from substrate, colonised by fungi, have
shown outstanding phenomena (although these have not been explicitly included in
the above analysis).
More speciﬁcally, in one trial (not included in the analyses above) we observed
highfrequency(w = 86s,median86s,σ = 7andd = 283s,median250s,σ = 166)
and high amplitude (a = 11,448 , median 10,750 , σ = 3, 664). An example of
these high amplitude spikes is shown in Fig.2d.
In another trial we observed very slow variations of resistance (c. 3 · 104 from the
start of the ascent to the end of the descent). On tops of these variations there were
trains of 5–7 spikes. An example is shown in Fig.2e. Average widths w of these
spike is 1, 094 s (σ = 475), a = 158  (σ = 49) and d = 1, 135 s (σ = 442).
In fruit bodies, we typically recorded two types of spikes: low frequency (w =
1, 690 s, σ = 32 and d = 3, 450 s, σ = 161) and high amplitude (a = 1, 632 ,
σ = 116) and high frequency (w = 580 s, σ = 16 and d = 2, 630 s, σ = 188) and

experiments by applying direct voltage to the fungal substrate and measuring output
voltage. An example of the electrical potential of a substrate colonised by fungi
under 10 V applied is shown in Fig.2g. Voltage spikes are clearly observed. Spikes
with amplitude above 1 mV, marked by ‘*’, except the spike marked by ‘s’ have
been analysed. We can see two trains of three spikes each. Average width of the
spikes is 1,050 s (σ = 9.2, median 1,090 s), average amplitude 2.5 mV (σ = 0.68,
median 2.2 mV), while average distance between spikes is 2,318 s (σ = 25.6, median
2370 s).

Discussion
We demonstrated that oyster fungi P. ostreatus undergo oscillations of resistance
with trains of resistive spiking emerging. Spikes amplitude vary from 1 to 1.6 k
and width of spikes from 23 up to 28 min. A distance between spikes in a train varies
from 30 to nearly 60 min. The oscillations of resistance have so low frequency that
could not be explained using conventional electronics framework (e.g. charging of
a mycelium during probing) and resistance sampling was with very low frequency
(once per 10 s). Thus the only feasible explanation, we see is the translocation of
water and metabolites taking place in the mycelium. This translocation is periodic,
and more likely guided by calcium waves. Increase in a liquid in the mycelium loci
leads to reduced resistance. When the translocated mass of metabolites leaves the
area, the resistance increases. Rates of the translocation, measured by injecting ﬂu-
oresecent dye in hyphae, reported in [29] are 2–6 cm/hour for small specimen and
9–15 cm/hour for large specimen. The distance between electrodes in our exper-
iments was 1 cm, thus the above rate can be translated to the following width of
resistive spikes—10–30 min and 4–7 min. The ﬁrst estimates matches in scale with
resistive spikes measured in our experiments. The widths of resistive spikes are twice
the widths of electrical potential spikes observed by us previously in fruit bodies of
P. ostreatus [30]. All the above indicate that the resistive spiking observed is not an
artefact but manifestation of physiological processes in fungal mycelium and fruit
bodies. Therefore one of the application domains of the proposed methodological
setup and delivered results could be in monitoring physiological states of fungi:
the physiological states might reﬂect states of ecosystems inhabited by fungi [31].
In experiments with fungal oscillator we have found that at some stages the fun-
gal skin exhibits oscillations of the electrical potential. A width of a voltage spike
is c. 18 min, which is slightly less than an average width of resistive spikes, and an
average amplitude c. 2.5 mV (at 10 V DC voltage applied). The amplitude is not as
high as would be expected from our previous experience with slime mould electronic
oscillators [32]. This may be due to the fact that in the experiments with slime mould,
the electrodes were connected by a single protoplasmic tube, so its resistance was

crucial, while in the fungal skin the current can also propagate along remnants of
the wet hemp substrate. A very low frequency of fungal electronic oscillators does
not preclude us from considering inclusion of the oscillators in fully living or hybrid
analog circuits embedded into fungal architectures [33] and future specialised cir-
cuits and processors made from living and functionalised with nanoparticles fungi as
have been illustrated in prototypes of hybrid electronic devices with slime mould [22,
34–37].

Abstract The emerging ﬁeld of living technologies aims to create new functional
hybrid materials in which living systems interface and interact with inanimate ones.
Combining research into living technologies with emerging developments in com-
puting architecture has enabled the generation of organic electronics from plants and
slime mould. Here, we expand on this work by studying capacitive properties of a
substrate colonised by mycelium of grey oyster fungi, Pleurotus ostreatus. Capaci-
tors play a fundamental role in traditional analogue and digital electronic systems and
have a range of uses including sensing, energy storage and ﬁlter circuits. Mycelium
has the potential to be used as an organic replacement for traditional capacitor tech-
nology. Here, wer show that the capacitance of mycelium is in the order of hundreds
of picofarads and at the same time a voltage-dependent pseudocapacitance of the
order of hundreds of microfarads. We also demonstrate that the charge density of
the mycelium ‘dielectric’ decays rapidly with increasing distance from the source
probes. This is important as it indicates that small cells of mycelium could be used
as a charge carrier or storage medium, when employed as part of an array with
reasonable density.

knowledge to the development of future computing devices and architectures [1].
Research into living technologies is focused on the co-functional integration of
animate and non-organic systems [2]. Finally, organic electronics looks to use nat-
urally occurring materials as analogues to traditional semi-conductor circuits [3],
which often requires functionalisation using polymers or metallic compounds to
exploit ionic movement [4]. The development of organic electronics promises a
technology that is low-cost and has low production temperature requirements [5].
However, difﬁculties such as relatively low gain of organic transistors (approx. 5), and
the behavioural variability inherently means that there is a large amount of research
effort being placed into organic thin ﬁlm transistors [6–9], organic LEDs [10, 11],
and organic capacitors [12–14]. The capacitive properties of a device allows it to
either store energy or react to AC/DC signals differently. There are a number of
applications in which this property may be utilised, such as energy harvesting [15]
and memory [16]. Hybrid electronic circuits are a concept that looks to combine
traditional silicon, semi-conductor devices with elements found in nature [17, 18].
The capacitive properties of living tissues [19] have a wide range of potential
applications, e.g. the estimation of a plan root system size [20, 21], quantifying
the DNA content of eukaryotic cells [22], analysing water transport pathways in
plants [23], measuring heat injury in plants [24], measuring contents of minerals
in bones [25], gauging ﬁrmness of apples [26], sugar contents of citrus fruits [27],
maturity of avocados [28], estimating depth of epidermal barriers [29], studies of
endo- and exocytosis of single cells [30], and approximating mass and morphology
of microbial colonies [31–33].
Among various possible biological substrates for electronics, fungal mycelia are
one of the most promising materials.
Continuously increasing demand for electronics of new capabilities toward sens-
ing, signal analysis, data acquisition, and information processing pushes scientists for
searching for unconventional approaches creating new possibilities that may allow
fulﬁlling the growing requirements of users. The utilisation of fungal mycelium
seems to be an interesting approach that may enable the fabrication of a new class
of green wearable electronics of the future.
In the present study we focus on the capacitive properties of the mycelium of the
grey oyster fungi Pleurotus ostreatus for several reasons.
Firstly, research into the capacitive properties of fungi is lacking, despite their
huge potential for bioelectronic applications. Fungi are the largest, most widely
distributed and oldest group of living organisms on the planet [34]. The smallest
fungi are microscopic single cells, the largest, Armillaria bulbosa?, occupies 15
hectares and weighs 10 tons [35]. Fungi sense light, chemicals, gases, gravity and
electric ﬁelds [36] as well as demonstrating mechanosensing behaviour [37]. Thus,
their electrical properties can be tuned via various inputs.
Secondly, fungi have the potential to be used as distributed living computing
devices, i.e. large-scale networks of mycelium, which collect and analyse information
about environment and execute some decision making processes [38].
Finally, there is a growing interest in developing buildings from pre-fabricated
blocks of substrates colonised by fungi [39–41]. A recent initiative aims to grow

monolithic constructions in which living mycelium coexists with dried mycelium,
functionalised with nanoparticles and polymers [42]. In such a case, fungi could be
act as optical, tactile and chemical sensors, fuse and process information and perform
decision making computations [38].
Providing local charge to areas of mycelium allows the storage of information
inside the substrate. Identifying the area around which the induced charge can be
detected allows the construction of an array in the substrate where each cell can
contain individual bits of information. Determining the capacitive properties of fungi
takes a step towards the realisation of fungal analogue circuits—circuits that use fungi
to replace traditional semiconductors.

Experimental Method
Mycelium of the grey oyster fungi Pleurotus ostreatus (Ann Miller’s Speciality
Mushrooms Ltd, UK) was cultivated on damp wood shavings (Fig.1). Control sam-
plesofthegrowthmedium,woodshavings,werenotcolonisedbymycelium.Iridium-
coated stainless steel sub-dermal needles with twisted cables (Spes Medica SRL,
Italy) were inserted in the colonised substrate. An LCR meter (BK Precision, model
891) was used to provide a nominal reading of the capacitance of the sample with
probes at 10, 20, 40 and 50mm separation. Cyclic voltammograms in two electrode
setup has been recorded with with SP-150 potentiostat (Bio-Logic, France) in the
dark. Impedance spectra in the 1Hz–100 kHz frequency range were recorded with
Bode 100 vector network analyser (Omicron Labs, Austria). Voltage dependence
of pseudocapacitance was measured using chronocoulometric module of Bio-Logic
potentiostat.
The samples were charged using a bench top DC power supply (BK precision
9206) to 50V. The power supply output was de-activated and the discharge curve was
measured using a bench top digital multi-meter (DMM) Fluke 8846A (Fig.1b). To
fullycharacterisethecapacitanceofthesamples,boththechargeanddischargecurves
were monitored [43] with a number of probe separations (e.g. 10, 20, 40, and 50mm).
Measurements from the DMM were automated through a serial terminal from a host
PC. All bench-top equipment was high impedance to limit power lost through leakage
in the test equipment. All plots were generated using MATLAB. The sample interval
was approximately 0.33s. Multiple samples and repeated experimental recordings
were used to increase the statistical signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings.

Results
Capacitance Measurement
Samples of the growth medium and mycelium were measured for their capacitance
using a standard bench top LCR meter (Table1). The measured capacitance value of
the mycelium substrate was two to four fold greater than that of the growth medium
alone.Thevaluerecordedfordrywoodshavingscorrespondstothecapacitanceofthe
twisted cable inserted into the sample and served as a background value. Increased
humidity of the pristine substrate is higher. The values of capacitance were also
effected by the moisture content such that, if the capacitance of the mycelium was
measured straight after it is sprayed with water, the capacitance typically increased
compared to that of dry substrate.

Discharge Characteristics
Discharge characteristics of the growth medium and mycelium samples are shown
in Figs.2 and 3. Discharge curves were produced by setting up the DC power supply
and DMM in parallel with each other. The substrate being tested is then charged to
50V and the power supply output is disabled. The DMM continued to periodically
measure the remaining charge in the substrate for a period of time. The sample
interval was approximately 0.33s.
The discharge curves for both the growth medium and the mycelium are very
steep—approximated by an exponential Equation (1):

where the parameters for 95% ﬁtness for different mediums can be found in Table 2.
The discharge time is governed by equation τ = RC, where τ is the time constant,
R is a resistance, and C is a capacitance.
With capacitance in the order of pico-Farads, and input impedance of the source
and measurement equipment in the order of mega-Ohms, it is expected that the
discharge will be in the order of seconds.
Comparing the discharge curves of the growth medium to that of the mycelium
samples, it is evident that the discharge was not as steep in the mycelium due to
the increase in capacitance over the growth medium. However, it was still in the
pico-Farad range and, therefore, the majority of charge was lost after just over 5s.
Increasing the separation distance of the probes (Fig.3) had only a minimal effect
on the capacitance of the substrate (shown in Table1), and therefore minimal effect
on the discharge curve.
Observingthecharginganddischargingbehaviour of thesamplearoundthesource
electrodes helps to build a better picture of the current density of the mycelium
substrate. Figure4 shows how we placed the measurement equipment electrodes
10mm away from the source electrodes in the mycelium, in three different locations
shown in Fig.5. The sample was then charged for approximately 10mins before the
supply was turned off. The electrodes placed in ‘series’ (locations (a) and (b) on

Fig.5) with the charge electrodes (Fig.4a) show minimum voltage detected beyond
the supply electrodes in the horizontal plane, when the supply is active. Placing
the measurement probes in ‘parallel’ (location (c) on Fig.5) with the supply probes
(Fig.4b) demonstrates the fact that considerably more current is conducted between
the supply probes in the vertical plane. When the supply is de-activated, the voltage
around the supplies collapses almost instantly.
In order to provide better contact and a more consistent data set, another batch of
freshly inoculated substrate was placed in a box with gold-plated silver electrodes
(multiply twisted loop, ca 1.5cm long) with spacing of 2cm. Changes in electrical
properties of growing mycelium samples can be seen using cyclic voltammetry tech-
nique as shown in Fig.6a. These changes, however, does not seem fully systematic
and the ﬁrst (and only one clearly deﬁned) jumps randomly between 0.23 and 0.36V.
This behaviour may be associated with accumulation of more redox active metabolite
and indicate that simple voltammetry may not be the best technique for monitoring
of growth and evolving properties of mycelium.
Impedance spectroscopy (Fig.6b) indicates a gradual changes in the spectra,
reﬂecting the mycelium growth and demonstrating that almost fresh (wet substrate)
and substrate with well-grown mycelium have completely different electrical prop-
erties (Fig.6). Observed data indicate that both capacity and resistance of the sample
change gradually. In ﬁrst days after inoculation changes are fast, however after day 4
changes are much smaller. Character of recorded impedance spectra indicates a com-

plex electrical behaviour of studied samples—along with capacitive-like behaviour a
signiﬁcant contribution from diffusion-related Warburg-type component can be seen,
especially with more matured mycelium. Therefore an equivalent circuit encompass-
ing all these element was suggested.
The changes in the electrical properties of growing mycelium are logical and con-
sistent with expected mycelium topology of percolated network, with percolation
increasing with time (Fig.7). It can be clearly seen as gradually decreasing resistiv-
ity of the network, both Ohmic and Warburg components. Interestingly, capacitance
of the network stabilised after ca. 4 days, this is also associated with decreasing
capacitor quality factor. This is fully justiﬁed, as increased percolation of the net-
work created more conductivity pathways of different time constants—proton and
ionic conductivity both along the mycelium hyphae and between them. Capacitance

between real impedance (Zr), imaginary impedance (Zi) and phase shift angle (φ)
can be associated both with electrode/mycelium interface, and contacts between dif-
ferent hyphae. Time course of observed changes suggests the latter as the principal
component of observed capacitive behaviour.
This description is a bit simplistic and does not include the whole complexity of
electrical properties of mycelium. 3D representation of impedance spectra indicates,
much larger complexity of their capacitive response (Fig.8).
Charge Characteristics
The charge curves in the specimens around the supply electrodes provide an insight
into the ability of the substrate to conduct current. The sense electrodes were dis-
tanced from the source electrodes by varying amounts. Initially, the growth medium
was studied on its own (Fig.9). The dry wood shavings (Fig.9a) showed very low
voltage across the sense electrodes placed 10mm away from the source electrodes

(parallel). The dry shavings essentially acted as an open circuit and the measurement
electrodes picked up noise. Damp wood shavings form a more contiguous mass
and the introduction of the water helped to conduct current (Fig.9b). From a 50V
source a maximum voltage of approx. 15V was reached across the measurement
electrodes. Figure11 shows all charge curves for growth medium and mycelium.
From the superimposed plots we are able to observe the maximum voltage recorded
from the samples as the distance of the measurement probes are increased away from
the charge probes.
Preforming similar experiments with the mycelium substrate (Fig.10), it was
observed that moving the measurement electrodes further from the supply reduced
the measured Vmax over the ˜22min measurement window. Figure12 shows that the
maximum measured voltage dropped rapidly as the distance from the source elec-

trodes increased. At 10mm away from the source, less than 1/5th of the supply
was measured over 22mins, decreasing to less than 1/10th at 15mm separation.
Figure13 shows that, for the shortest paths between the two source electrodes, there
was a higher current density, indicated by the ﬁeld lines being closer together. As we
move further away from the centre of the two probes, the current density decreased
(arrows are shown further apart). Beyond the two probes in the ‘y–direction’, we
would expect to experience very little current ﬂow, however there are still fringing
ﬁeld effects which give rise to the small voltages shown in Fig.4a. Modern par-
allel plate capacitors have a large electrode/dielectric surface area to increase the
capacitance, and multi-layer capacitors interdigitate the electrode and dielectric to
achieve the required surface area in a very small package. Here we have not explored
the effect of surface area on capacitance, however, it can be seen from equation (2)
that increasing the area of the electrodes, in contact with our mycelium dielectric,
would lead to an increase in the capacitance. This was addressed by monitoring
the mycelium growth on electrodes implanted into freshly inoculated medium (vide
supra).
C = ϵ A
d
(2)
Where C is the capacitance, ϵ is the relative permittivity, A is the surface area, and
d is the separation of the electrodes.
Additionally, the moisture content of the mycelium had an impact on its ability
to conduct current. Figure14 shows that, if the sample of mycelium is continually
charged over a period where it is also drying out, the conducted charge can decrease
rapidly as the water content vanishes. The measurement electrodes for this sample
are 5mm away from the source, however we see a decrease in measured voltage of
almost 15V over the measurement window.
Application of high potentials (50V in the case of former experiments) may, how-
ever result in electrolysis of mycelial ﬂuid and some irreversible changes. In order
to evaluate utility of fungal capacitor charge-discharge tests have been performed
with much lower voltages and chronoamperimetric detection. Charging pulses with
amplitudes varying from 0.2 to 1.0V were applied to pairs of electrodes with 2cm
clearance for 30s, and then discharge current at short circuit conditions was recorded
for additional 90s. Resulted current proﬁles are shown in Fig.15a. It can be observed,
that effective total capacitance (Fig.15b) is much higher than results obtained at low
amplitude impedance spectroscopy (Fig.7). It can be justiﬁed by a mixed capacitance
character with a dominating contribution of electrochemical pseudocapacitance,

cal membranes are the dominating factor, as the voltage dependence of capacitance

dominating one, however its importance should be also noted. It is further supported
by observed discrepancy between charge stored during charging pulse and charge
collected during discharge. This discrepancy is voltage-independent and indicates
signiﬁcant charge loss, most probably due to ionic diffusion within hyphae.

Conclusions
Mycelium exhibits rather unconventional, voltage- and frequency- dependent capac-
itive characteristics. Depending on the frequency measurement and applied voltage,
capacitance of mycelium samples very form hundreds of picofarads to hundreds
of microfarads. This enormous discrepancy, spanning six orders of magnitude, is,
however not unjustiﬁed. In reﬂects complexity of electrical behaviour of mycelium,
which is a consequence of its molecular composition, structure and topology. We

overgrown with living mycelium. Complex topology of the materials, combined
with biochemical processes creates a challenging system to study. Simple measure-
ments with benchtop multimeter do not yield high capacitance values, probably due
to non-optimal contact of electrodes with mycelium and substrate. High voltage
measurements, it turn, may induce some irreversible processes and electrolysis of
mycelial cytosol, followed by cell disruption. Not harmful to the mycelium as a
whole, these local damages are reﬂected in rather low charge storage capability due
to damaged cell walls. AC measurements also do not give high capacitance values
(up to 10 nF), suggesting contribution of diffusive processes (observed as Warburg
impedance in impedance experiments) Finally, at low applied voltages, DC exper-
iments demonstrate, however, high charge storage capacity signiﬁcantly increased
up to 150 microfarads. Due to leackage processes and rather low quality factor they
cannot be efﬁciently used for energy storing application, however may be further
explored for other application, e.g. sensing, mycelial communication and monitor-
ing of mycelium growth. This shows great potential for the use of mycelium networks
to conduct or store charge in local ‘hot spots’ that are isolated from other areas in
the immediate vicinity, especially at low signal amplitudes. However, it is crucial
that the moisture content of the mycelium is kept constant since the ability to carry
charge is strongly inﬂuenced by moisture content.
Any potential analogue circuits implemented with live mycelium will be vul-
nerable to environmental conditions, especially humidity, availability of nutrients
and removal of metabolites. Ideally, the mycelium networks should be stabilised
so they continue functioning whilst drying. This stabilisation can be achieved
either by coating or priming the mycelium with polyaniline (PANI) or poly(3,4-
ethylenedioxythiophene) and polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT-PSS). This approach
hasbeenproventobesuccessfulinexperimentswithslimemouldP.polycephaum [44,
44, 45],andthusitislikelythatasimilartechniquemaybeappliedtofungi.Moreover,
PABI and PEDOT-PSS incorporated in, or interfaced with, mycelium can bring addi-
tional functionality in terms of conductive pathways [46], memory switches [47, 48]
and synaptic-like learning [49, 50]. An optional route toward the functional ﬁxation
of mycelium would be doping the networks with substances that affect the electrical
properties of mycelium, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, aluminium oxide,
calcium phosphate. Similar studies conducted in our laboratory using slime mould
and plants have shown that such an approach is feasible [51, 52]. Moreover using a
combination of PANI and carbon nanotubes in the mycelium network afford it super-
capacitive properties [53, 54]. Another potential direction of future studies would be
to increase the capacity of the mycelium as a result of modifying the network geom-
etry by varying nutritional conditions and temperature [55–58], concentration of
nutrients [59] or with chemical and physical stimuli [36]. With regards to the impact
of our ﬁnding for the ﬁeld of unconventional computing, we believe further research
on experimental laboratory implementation of capacitive threshold logic [60, 61],

Mem-Fractive Properties of Fungi
Alexander E. Beasley, Mohammed-Salah Abdelouahab, René Lozi,
Michail-Antisthenis Tsompanas, and Andrew Adamatzky
Abstract Memristors close the loop for I-V characteristics of the traditional, pas-
sive, semi-conductor devices. A memristor is a physical realisation of the material
implication and thus is a universal logical element. Memristors are getting particular
interest in the ﬁeld of bioelectronics. Electrical properties of living substrates are
not binary and there is nearly a continuous transitions from being non-memristive to
mem-fractive (exhibiting a combination of passive memory) to ideally memristive.
In laboratory experiments we show that living oyster mushrooms Pleurotus ostreatus
exhibit mem-fractive properties. We offer a piece-wise polynomial approximation
of the I-V behaviour of the oyster mushrooms.

Introduction
Originally proposed by Chua in 1971 [1], the memristor poses a fourth basic circuit
element, whose characteristics differ from that of R, L and C elements. Going through
a more general point of view, Chua with coauthors Abdelouahab and Lozi [2], using
fractional calculus, published 43 years after his original intuition, a global theory
of family of electric elements: the memfractance theory which is the most general
theory of such elements with memory, enlarging this family to mem-capacitive and
mem-inductive elements of ﬁrst, second third, etc. order.

In the memfractance theory the pinch observed in the voltage-current curves of
the memristor is only a particular case (Figs. 1 and 2) of this memfractive electric
element, allowing more ﬂexibility in modeling.
Memristance has been seen in nano-scale devices where electronic and ionic
transport are coupled under an external bias voltage. Strukov et al. [3] posit that
the hysteric I-V characteristics observed in thin-ﬁlm, two-terminal devices can be
understoodasmemristive.However,thisisobservedbehaviourofdevicesthatalready
have other, large signal behaviours.
The ideal memristor model (Figs. 1 and 2) is shown to display ‘lobes’ on the I-V
characterisation sweeps, indicating that the current resistance is a function of the
previous resistance—hence a memristor has memory. For the purposes of analysis,
graphs are referred to by their quadrants, starting with quadrant one as the top right
and being numbered anti-clockwise.
Similarly, the mem-capacitor and mem-inductor exhibit a change in capaci-
tance/inductance as a function of the applied voltage being swept. The introduction
of the mem-capacitor and mem-inductor in [2, 4] complete the non-binary solution
space of the mem-fractor that exerts a device may exhibit a combination of memris-
tive, mem-inductor and mem-capacitor elements.
Finding a true memristor is by no means an easy task. Nevertheless, a number of
studies have turned to nature to provide the answer, with varying success. Memristive
properties of organic polymers were discovered before the ‘ofﬁcial’ discovery of the
memristor was announced in [3]. The ﬁrst examples of memristors could go back to
the singing arc, invented by Duddell in 1900, which was originally used in wireless

telegraphy before the invention of the triode [5]. In addition, memristive proper-
ties of organic polymers have been studied since 2005 in experiments focussing on
hybrid electronic devices based on the polyaniline-polyethylenoxide junction [6].
Memristive properties of living creatures, their organs and ﬂuids have been demon-
strated in skin [7–9], blood [10], plants [11, 12] (including fruits [13, 14]), slime
mould [15, 16], tubulin microtubules [17–19]. Most recent results include DNA and
melanin based memristive devices [20], biomaterials extracted from plant tissue [21].
We present a study of the I-V characteristics of the fruit bodies of the grey Oyster
fungi Pleurotus ostreatus. Why fungi? Previously we recorded extracellular electrical
potential of Oyster’s fruit bodies, basidiocarps [22] and found that the fungi generate
action potential like impulses of electrical potential. The impulses can propagate as
isolated events, or in trains of similar impulses. Further, we demonstrated, albeit in
numerical modelling, that fungi can be used as computing devices, where informa-
tion is represented by spikes of electrical activity, a computation is implemented in a
mycelium network and an interface is realised via fruit bodies [23]. A computation
with fungi might not be useful per se, because the speed of spike propagation is sub-
stantially lower than the clock speed in conventional computers. However, the fungal
computation becomes practically feasible when embedded in a slow developing spa-
tial process, e.g. growing architecture structures. Thus, in [24] we discussed how
to: produce adaptive building constructions by developing structural substrate using
live fungal mycelium, functionalising the substrate with nanoparticles and polymers

196

to make mycelium-based electronics, implementing sensorial fusion and decision
making in the fungal electronics.
Why we are looking for mem-fractive properties of fungi? Mem-fractors [2] have
combinations of properties exhibited by memristors, mem-capacitors and mem-
inductors. A memristor is a material implication [25, 26] and can, therefore, can
be used for constructing other logical circuits, stateful logic operations [25], logic
operations in passive crossbar arrays of memristors [27], memory aided logic cir-
cuits [28], self-programmable logic circuits [29], and memory devices [30]. If strands
of fungal mycelium in a mycelium bound composites and the fruit bodies show some
mem-fractive properties then we can implement a variety of memory and comput-
ing devices embedded directly into architectural building materials made from the
fungal substrates [24] and living fungal wearables [31, 32]. The ﬁeld of living fun-
gal wearables is currently in its infant stage, however it showed undeniably slim
shape, good adaptability, and very low energy consumption compared to artiﬁcial
wearable sensory devices [33]. Mycelium bound composites—masses of organic
substrates colonised by fungi—are future environmentally sustainable growing bio-
materials [34–36], already they are used in acoustic [37–39] and thermal [40–45]
insulation wall cladding and packaging materials [46–48].
In [24] it is proposed to develop a structural substrate by using live fungal
mycelium, functionalise the substrate with nanoparticles and polymers to make
mycelium-based electronics, implement sensorial fusion and decision making in the
mycelium networks [49] and to grow monolithic buildings from the functionalised
fungal substrate [50]. Fungal buildings would self-grow, build, and repair themselves
subject to substrate supplied, use natural adaptation to the environment, sense all that
humans can sense. To implement sensorial integration and make decisions fungal
materials will require electronic circuits, the fungal memristors will form essential
part of the circuits.
The approach taken has a two-fold novelty component. First, we focus on mem-
fractive properties of a substrate, which offers more fuzzy logic like approach of the
IV properties of materials. Second, we study electrical IV properties of fungi, which
are per se is a novel substrate for future organic electronics.

Experimental Set Up
We used grey oyster fungi Pleurotus ostreatus (Ann Miller’s Speciality Mushrooms
Ltd, UK) cultivated on wood shavings. The iridium-coated stainless steel sub-dermal
needles with twisted cables (Spes Medica SRL, Italy) were inserted in fruit bodies
(Fig. 3) of grey Oyster fungi using two different arrangements: 10 mm apart in the
cap of the fungi (cap-to-cap), Fig. 3a, and translocation zones (cap-to-stem), Fig. 3b.
I-V sweeps were performed on the fungi samples with Keithley Source Measure Unit
(SMU)2450(KeithleyInstruments,USA)underthefollowingconditions:[−500mV
to 500 mV, −1 V to 1 V] with the samples in ambient lab light (965 Lux). Varying the
step size of the voltage sweep allowed testing the I-V characteristics of the subject at

different frequencies. The voltage ranges are limited so as not to cause the electrolysis
of water. Each condition was repeated at least six times over the samples. Voltage
sweeps were performed in both directions (cyclic voltammetry) and plots of the I-V
characteristics were produced.
MATLAB was used to analyse the frequency and distribution of spiking behaviour
observed in the I-V sweeps of the fruiting bodies under test (Sect. 3.1). All histogram
plots are binned according to the voltage interval set for the Keithley SMU.

Results
Fruit body samples are shown to exhibit memristive properties when subject to a
voltage sweep. The ideal memristor model has a crossing point at 0V, where theo-
retically no current ﬂows. Figures 4 and 5 show the results of cyclic voltammetry of
grey oyster fungi with electrodes positioned both in the fungi caps and stems. From
Figs. 4 and 5, it can be seen that when 0 V is applied by the source meter, a reading of
a nominally small voltage and current is performed. The living membrane is capable
of generating potential across the electrodes, and hence a small current is observed.
Mem-capacitors produce similar curves to that of an ideal memristor in Fig. 1, when
plotting charge (q) against voltage (v) [51]. Additionally, mem-inductors produce
similar plots for current (i) against ﬂux (ϕ). However, the crossing point in the curves
observed in quadrant 3 results to a pinched hysteresis loop. That is an indication that
the cyclic voltammetry measurement is provided by a device that has mem-fractance
properties.
While the sample under test is subjected to a positive voltage (quadrant 1), it can
be seen there is nominally a positive current ﬂow. Higher voltages result in a larger
current ﬂow. For an increasing voltage sweep there is a larger current ﬂow for the
corresponding voltage during a negative sweep.
Similarly, in quadrant 3 where there is a negative potential across the electrodes,
the increasing voltage sweep yields a current with smaller magnitude than the mag-
nitude of the current on a negative voltage sweep. Put simply, the fruit body has a
resistance that is a function of the previous voltage conditions.
By applying averaging to the performed tests, a clear picture is produced that
demonstrates for a given set of conditions, a typical response shape can be expected
(Figs. 6 and 7). The stem-to-cap placement of the electrodes in the fruit body yields
a tighter range for the response (Figs. 6b and 7b). This can be expected due to the
arrangement of the transportation pathways, so-called translocation zone distinct
from any vascular hyphae [52, 53], in the fruit body which run from the edge of
the cap and down back through the stem to the root structure (mycelium). Cap-to-
cap placement of the electrodes applies the potential across a number of the solutes
translocation pathways and hence yields a wider range of results. However, for all
results, it is observed that the positive phase of the cyclic voltammetry produces a
different conduced current than the negative phase. The opening of the hysteresis
curve around point zero suggests the fungus is not an ideal mem-ristor, instead it is

device prevents the curve from closing completely to produce the classic mem-ristor
pinching shape.
Reducing the voltage step size (by ten fold, i.e. to 0.001 V) for the I-V characteri-
sation is synonymous to reducing the frequency of the voltage sweep. Decreasing the
sweep frequency of the voltage causes the chances of “pinching” in the I-V sweep to
increase, as seen in quadrant 1 of Fig. 8. This further reinforces the presence of some
mem-capacitor behaviour. Since the charging frequency of the fungus has now been

reduced there is a greater amount of time for capacitively stored energy to dissipate,
thus producing a more ‘resistive’ plot with a pinch in the hysteresis. However, as
indicated by two subsequent runs of voltammetry (Fig. 8), the electrical behaviour of
the fungus is heavily altered under these frequencies and, thus, the repeatable obser-
vation of similar curves can not be realised (as it was observed in the aforementioned
measurements and especially the stem to cap electrode placement). Nonetheless, the
production of the curves can be controlled more efﬁciently by selecting appropriate

Spiking
It is observed from Figs. 4 and 5 that portions of the cyclic voltammetry result in
oscillations in the conduced current, or spiking activity. Oscillations occur most
prominently on the positive phase of the cyclic voltammetry as the applied voltage
approaches 0V and similarly on the negative phase, again as the applied voltage
approaches 0 V. Current oscillations are typically in the order of nano-amps and
persist for a greater number of cycles when the electrodes are arranged as a pair

Oyster mushroom fruit bodies with cap to cap electrodes
Fig. 8 I-V Characteristics of fungi fruit bodies with the voltage step size set to 0.001 V. The two
traces represent repeated runs of the same experiment
on the fruit body cap (between ﬁve and ten cycles) compared to the stem-to-cap
arrangement (fewer than ﬁve repeats).
Figure 9 demonstrates the spiking frequency of a single repeat of the cyclic
voltammetry performed between −0.5 V and 0.5 V with the electrodes in a cap-
to-cap arrangement. It is shown in the ﬁgure that the voltage interval—change in the
applied, swept voltage— between spikes in an oscillation period are less than 0.06 V.
Figure 10 concatenates the data for all repeats of the cyclic voltammetry performed
under four different conditions. It is clearly shown that in cap-to-cap arrangements
the voltage interval between spikes is less than when the electrodes are in a translo-
cation arrangement. Any spikes that occur when the voltage interval becomes large
can be taken as not occurring during a period of oscillation in the sweep, instead they
occur infrequently and randomly during the sweep. Reducing the frequency of the
voltage sweep (Fig. 8) also has the effect of removing the current oscillations.

Mathematical Model of Mushroom Mem-Fractance
Here we report the I-V characteristics of grey Oyster fungi Pleurotus ostreatus
fruit bodies. It is evident from the results that grey Oyster fungi display memris-
tive behaviour.
Although the fruit bodies typically do not demonstrate the “pinching" property
of an ideal memristor [54], it can be clearly seen that the biological matter exhibits
memory properties when the electrical potential across the substrate is swept. A
positive sweep yields a higher magnitude current when the applied voltage is positive;
and a smaller magnitude current when the applied voltage is negative.

Fractional Order Memory Elements (FOME) are proposed as a combination of
Fractional Order Mem-Capacitors (FOMC) and Fractional Order Mem-Inductors
(FOMI) [2]. The FOME (Eq. 1) is based on the generalised Ohm’s law and
parameterised as follows: α1, α2 are arbitrary real numbers—it is proposed that
0 ≤α1, α2 ≤1 models the solution space by [4], Fα1,α2
M
is the mem-fractance, q(t)
is the time dependent charge, ϕ(t) is the time dependent ﬂux. Therefore, the mem-
fractance (Fα1,α2
M
) is an interpolation between four points: MC—mem-capacitance,
RM—memristor, M I—mem-inductance, and R2 M—the second order memristor
(Fig. 11). Full derivations for the generalised FOME model are given by [2, 4].
The deﬁnition of mem-fractance can be straightforward generalised to any value of
α1, α2 (see Fig. 27 in [2]).

The appearance of characteristics from various memory elements in the fungal
I-V curves supports the assertion that the fungal is a mem-fractor where α1 and α2
are both greater than 0 and less than 2.
There is no biological reason for mem-fractance of oyster fungi fruit bodies with
stem to cap electrodes, to be a usual closed formula. Therefore, one can get only
a mathematical approximation of this function. In the following, we propose two
alternatives to obtain the best approximation for mem-fractance in the case of average
fruit bodies I-V characteristics for cyclic voltammetry of Fig. 7b.

numerically, the values t∗(α2) which vanish the denominator of Fα1,α2

to eliminate the singularities, we need to determine the couples (α1, α2) ∈[0, 2]2,
vanishing simultaneously denominator and numerator of Fα1,α2

Fig. 21 Comparison between average experimental data of cyclic voltammetry performed over
−1V to 1V, Stem-to-cap electrode placement, and approximate values of v(t) and i(t)
Fig. 22 Both average experimental data curve and the curve computed from closed approximative
formula are nested into the histogram of data of all runs
The comparison of average experimental data of cyclic voltammetry performed
over −1V to 1V, stem-to-cap electrode placement, and closed approximative formula
is displayed in Fig. 21, showing a good agreement between both curves except near
the maximum value of v(t) and i(t). Figure 22 shows that the curve computed from
closed approximative formula belongs to the histogram of data of all runs. The
discrepancy between both curves is due to the method of approximation chosen in
(2) and (3).
It is possible, as we show in the next subsection to improve the ﬁtting of the
approximated curve near the right hand-side vertex, using piecewise polynomial
approximation of both v(t) and i(t).

Alternative Approximation of the Cycling Voltammetry
Due to the way of conducting the experiments, the voltage curve presents a vertex,
that means that the function v(t) is non-differentiable for T = 87.23747459. In fact,
the value of T is the average value of the non-differentiable points for the 20 runs.
In this alternative approximation, we follow the same 4 steps as previously, chang-
ing the approximation by a twenty-four-degree polynomial to an approximation by
a 2-piecewise ﬁfth-degree-polynomial, for both v(t) and i(t).
Step 1: approximation of v(t) by a 2-piecewise ﬁfth-degree-polynomial (Fig. 23)
whose coefﬁcients are given in Table 6.

However, because fractional derivative has memory effect, for T < t < 171, the
formula is slightly more complicated (depicted in Eq. 15).
UsingintegrationbypartrepeatedlysixtimesweobtainEq.16.Inthis2-piecewise
approximation, the vertex is non-differentiable, this implies that Eq. 16 expression
has a singularity at T (because (t −T )−α1,2 →∞). It could be possible to avoid this
singularity, using a 3-piece wise approximation, smoothing the vertex. However, the
calculus are very tedious. We will explain, below, what our simpler choice implies.
Finally, Eqs. 17 and 18 are obtained.

Step 4: choice of parameter α1 and α2: Following the same idea as for the ﬁrst
alternative, we try to avoid singularity for Fα1,α2
M
(t), except of course the singularity
near T , which is of mathematical nature (non-differentiability of voltage and inten-
sity at t = T ). Figure 25 displays the ﬁrst zero t∗(α2) ≥T , of the denominator of
Fα1,α2
M
(t). One can see that t∗(1) ∼= T .
Figure 26 displays the curves of couples (α1, α2) for which the denominator
and numerator of Fα1,α2
M
(t) are null simultaneously for t < T and t > T . On this
ﬁgure, the value of α1, that corresponds to α2 = 1 is α1 ≈1.78348389322388. The
corresponding Mem-fractance is displayed in Fig. 27.
The singularity observed in Figs. 27 and 28 is due to the non-differentiability of
both voltage and intensity functions at point T . It is only a mathematical problem
of approximation which can be solved using a 3-piecewise polynomial instead of
the 2-piecewise polynomial (P1(t), P2(t)) and (P3(t), P4(t)). The third added
piecewise polynomials for v(t) and i(t) being deﬁned on the tiny interval [87.24,
87.90]. However due to more tedious calculus, we do not consider this option in the
Fig. 26 Couples (α1, α2) for which the denominator and numerator of Fα1,α2
M
(t) are null simulta-
neously for t < T (blue dot) and t > T (red dot)

present study. It is only a math problem, and one can consider that Fig. 28 represents
the value of the mem-fractance in the interval [0, 87.24] ∪[87.90, 171].
The value of (α1 = 1.78, α2 = 1.00) belongs to the line segment of Fig. 11, whose
extremities are Memristor, and Capacitor. Which means that Oyster mushroom fruit
bodies with stem-to-cap electrodes, is like a mix of such basic electronic devices.
The comparison of average experimental data of cyclic voltammetry performed over
−1V to 1V, stem-to-cap electrode placement, and closed approximative formula is
displayed in Fig. 29, showing a very good agreement between both curves.

Discussion
Two are the main remarks of this study. First, both approximations used in Sect. 4
converge to Mem-fractance with parameter value (α1, α2)—belonging inside or on
edge of the triangle T of Fig. 11, whose vertices are Memristor, Memcapacitor and
Capacitor. Of course, the value for these approximations are not exactly the same.

Mem-Fractive Properties of Fungi
221
Fig. 29 Comparison between average experimental data of cyclic voltammetry performed over
−1V to 1V, Stem-to-cap electrode placement, and closed approximative formula
This is in part, due to the fact that we consider that the most regular approxima-
tion is the one for which the function range (Fα1,α2
M
(t)) is minimal. Other choices
based on physiology of Mushroom could be invoked. Moreover, the Mem-fractance
is computed on the averaged curve of 20 runs which do not present exactly the
same characteristic voltammetry. Oyster mushroom fruit bodies are living substrates.
Commonly for living substrates their morphology, i.e. geometry of the translocation
zones [52], is changing from one fruit body to another. This high variability prevents
exact reproduction of electrical property between the experimental trials.
The second remark is the fact that the use of fractional derivatives to analyze the
mem-fractance, is obvious if one considers that fractional derivatives have memory,
which allows a perfect modelling of memristive elements. Their handling is however
delicate if one wants to avoid any ﬂaw.
Similar I-V characteristics have been experienced for slime mould [15] and
apples [13]. The cyclic voltammetry experiments demonstrate that the I-V curve
produced from these living substrates is a closed loop where the negative path does
not matchthepositivepath. Hencethefungi displaythecharacteristics of amemristor.
A similar conclusion is drawn for the microtubule experiments [56]. The microtubule
exhibits different resistive properties for the same applied voltage depending on the
history of applied voltages.
Additionally, the fruit bodies produce current oscillations during the cyclic
voltammetry. This oscillatory effect is only observed on one phase of the voltamme-
try for a given voltage range which is, again, a behaviour that can be associated to a
device whose resistance is a function of its previous resistance. This spiking activity
is typical of a device that exhibits memristive behaviours. Firstly, it was reported in
experiments with electrochemical devices using graphite reference electrodes, that
a temporal dependence of the current of the device—at constant applied voltage—
causes charge accumulation and discharge [57]. The spiking is also apparent in some
plots, for a large electrode size, in experiments with electrode metal on solution-
processed ﬂexible titanium dioxide memristors [58]. A detailed analysis of types of
spiking emerging in simulated memristive networks was undertaken in [59]. Most

222
A. E. Beasley et al.
recent research on spiking of memristors demonstrated the rich and complex spiking
dynamics of the NbO2 memristor memristive neurons based on the insulator-metal
transition model [60]. Repeatable observations of the spiking behaviour in I-V of the
fungi is very important because this opens new pathways for the implementation of
neuromorphic computing with fungi. A fruitful theoretical foundation of this ﬁeld is
already well developed [61–66].

Conclusion
The fruit bodies of grey oyster fungi Pleurotus ostreatus were subjected to I-V char-
acterisation a number of times, from which it was clearly shown that they exhibit
mem-fractor properties. Under cyclic voltammetry, the fruit body will conduct dif-
ferently depending on the phase (positive or negative) of the voltammetry. This
behaviour produces the classic “lobes” in the I-V characteristics of a memristor.
However, a biological medium, such as the fruit body of the grey Oyster fungi
presented here, will differ from that of the ideal memristor model since the “pinching”
behaviour and size of the hysteresis lobes are functions of the frequency of the voltage
sweep as well as the previous resistance. Typically, the biological medium generates
its own potential across the electrodes, therefore, even when no additional potential
is supplied, there is still current ﬂow between the probes. This property of the fungi
produces an opening in the I-V curve that is a classic property of the mem-capacitor.
Since the fungi are exhibiting properties of both memristors and mem-capacitors,
their electrical memory behaviour puts them somewhere in the mem-fractor solution
space where 0 < α1, α2 < 1. Hence, it has been shown that fungi act as mem-fractors.
We believe a potential practical implementation of the mem-fractive properties of
the fungi would be in the sensorial and computing circuits embedded into mycelium
bound composites. In [24] we proposed to develop a structural substrate by using
live fungal mycelium, functionalise the substrate with nanoparticles and polymers to
make mycelium-based electronics, implement sensorial fusion and decision making
in the mycelium networks [49] and to grow monolithic buildings from the func-
tionalised fungal substrate [50]. Fungal buildings would self-grow, build, and repair
themselves subject to substrate supplied, use natural adaptation to the environment,
sense all that humans can sense. Whilst major parts of a building will be made from
dried and cured mycelium composites there is an opportunity to use blocks with living
mycelium as embedded living computing elements. Right now we established just
some components of the computing fungal architectures. Future challenges will be
in implementation of a large scale computing circuits employing mem-fractive prop-
erties of the living mycelium and fruit bodies and an integration of living mycelium
computers into buildings made from biomaterials.

Electrical Signal Transfer by Fungi

Abstract Mycelium-bound composites consist of discrete substrate elements joined
together by ﬁlamentous hypha strands. These composites can be moulded or extruded
into custom components of desired shapes. When live fungi are present these com-
posites exhibit electrical conductivity as well as memfractive and capacitive prop-
erties. These composites might be used in nonlinear electrical circuits. We investi-
gated the AC conductive properties of mycelium-bound composites and fungal fruit
bodies at higher frequencies, spanning three overlapping frequency ranges: 20Hz
to 300kHz, 10Hz to 4MHz, and 50kHz to 3GHz, to advance fungal electronics.
Our measurements revealed that mycelium-bound composites primarily function as
low-pass ﬁlters, with an average cut-off frequency of 500kHz and a roll-off rate
of −14 dB/decade. Within the pass band, the average attenuation is less than 1dB.
Fungal fruiting bodies have signiﬁcantly lower mean cut-off frequencies that range
from 5Khz to 50Khz depending on the species. Their roll-off range from −20 to
−30 decibels per decade, with mean attenuation across the pass band less than
3decibels. The precise mechanism underlying frequency-dependent attenuation is
unclear. However, the high-water content, which is around 80% in mycelium-bound
composites and up to 92% in fruiting bodies, is important. Because of the presence
of dissolved ionizable solids, this water content is electrically conductive, making
it a likely contributing factor. This research looks into the potential applications of
mycelium-bound composites and fungal fruiting bodies in analog computing.

Introduction
Mycelium-bound composites are commonly formed by fungi colonising natural sub-
strates such as Rye grain seeds [1–4]. In a recent paper [5], we proposed a plan to
create a functional material out of living fungal mycelium. This entails strengthening
the substrate with nanoparticles and polymers in order to construct mycelium-based
electronics [6–8]. These composites can be moulded into customised combinations
of desired shapes and dimensions using procedures such as moulding [9] or extru-
sion [10]. There is also the possibility of cultivating mycelium-bound composites
for the construction of uniﬁed circuits, including constructs such as mycelium net-
works [11].
At lower frequencies, both mycelium-bound composites and fungal fruit bodies
exhibit complicated electrical features, including resistive spikes [12], memfractive
behaviour [7, 13], and the ability to control the frequency of external electrical
inputs [14]. Moisture concentration affects their electrical characteristics [15]. They
are also known for their ability to respond to chemical and physical inputs, which
results in changes in their electrical patterns [16–19] and electrical conductivity [8].
In a separate research [13], we developed a unique notion called “direct fungal elec-
tronics.” This burgeoning ﬁeld consists of a collection of live electronic devices made
of mycelium-bound composites or pure mycelium. These fungal electronic devices
may change their impedance and emit bursts of electrical potential in response to
external control settings. Fungal electronics can be integrated into fungal materials,
worn technologies, or used as standalone sensing and computing tools. Communi-
cation between basic fungal-electronic components is critical. Encoding data inside
alternating current frequencies is one potential approach for transferring data in a
robust manner.
In order to further our investigation into the information-conveying properties
of mycelium-bound composites and fungal fruit bodies, we conducted a study to
determine how their electrical properties evolve across the higher frequency range
[20, 21].

Methods and Materials
100 g block of substrate (Rye grain seeds) well colonised with Pleurotus ostreatus
(Ann Miller’s Speciality Mushrooms, UK, [22]) was enclosed in polypropylene bags
ﬁtted with 0.5µm air ﬁlter patch, see Fig. 2a. The block was kept at ambient room
temperature (18 ◦C to 22 ◦C ) inside a growth tent (in darkness) when not being used
in experiments.
Five species of fresh fruiting bodies were sourced from a local supplier (Wholesale
Fruit Centre Bristol, UK), see Fig. 1a–e. Two additional species were sourced from
a woodland mushroom farm (Livesey Brothers Ltd., Leicestershire, UK), seebreak

2.1
Electrical Properties of Mycelium-Bound Composites
and Fungal Fruiting Bodies Over the 20Hz to 300kHz
Frequency Range
To make electrical connections to the mycelium-bound composites and fungal fruit-
ing bodies, bespoke electrodes were developed. The copper crimps at the terminal end
of the stainless steel sub-dermal needle electrodes (Spes Medica S.r.l., IT) were sol-
dered to the centre conductor of SMA (SubMiniature version A) right angle connec-
tors, see Fig. 2a. The needles were inserted ∼15mm depth into body of grain spawn
and through fungal fruiting bodies of various thicknesses. The distance between the
centres of the needle electrodes was maintained at 20 mm by a spacer, see Fig. 2b.
‘Radial’ measurements were recorded with the electrodes equal distance from the
centre of the cap of the fruiting body while ‘axial’ measurements were recorded with
the electrodes perpendicular to centre of the cap. ‘Radial’ electrodes are therefore
across the cap’s gills while ‘axial’ electrodes are aligned with the gills.
Measurements were recorded within a bespoke RF-shielded test chamber, see
Fig.2.Themycelium-boundcompositeandfruitingbodieswereelectricallyinsulated
(and physically separated by ∼5mm) from the inside of diecast aluminium enclosure

(Agaricus bisporus) inside RF shielded enclosure via coaxial connections
(model Hammond 1550H, 222 mm × 146 mm × 105 mm) with a polypropylene
liner. Coaxial leads and connectors (including through the RF-chamber wall) were
SMA type.
Electrical impedance and other circuit parameters were measured using a dig-
ital Inductance Capacitance Resistance (LCR) meter (model 891, BK Precision
Ltd., UK [23]). The LCR meter was conﬁgured to scan across the 20Hz to
300kHz frequency range applying 1Vrms sinusoidal voltage waveform through the
mycelium bound composite and fruiting bodies. 301 measurements being automati-
cally recorded per sweep with ∼0.05% accuracy.
2.2
Electrical Properties of Mycelium Bound Composites and
Fungal Fruiting Bodies Over the 10Hz to 4MHz
Frequency Range
The signal propagation was measured using an impedance—amplitude—phase fre-
quency response network analyzer (C60, Cypher Instruments, London, UK [24]).
The C60 network analyzer passes 2Vpp sinusoidal voltage waveform through the
mycelium bound composite and fruiting bodies at a plurality of frequencies (10Hz to
4MHz). The network analyzer was connected to the native CypherGraph (V1.28.0)
software package on a Windows computer to control functionality and store measure-
ments. The software evaluates the waveform after it passes through the sample and
displays it as a Bode plot, the frequency response was analyzed and measurements
stored.
Experimental ‘controls’ were recorded using the same setup, however, the
mycelium-bound composite was replaced with uncolonised substrate (Rye grain
seeds in 50ml glass beaker) and electrically insulating substrate (open cell
polyurethane foam with water of different conductivity in 50ml glass beaker). The
‘controls’ were subject to the same frequency spectrum of sinusoidal waveforms to

explore if part of the signal was being propagated through the fungal hypha rather
than the substrate or the instrumentation.
2.3
Electrical Properties of Mycelium Bound Composites and
Fungal Fruiting Bodies Over the 50kHz to 3GHz
Frequency Range
S-parameters S11 and S21 were measured using the previously described setup of
electrodes and RF-shielded test chamber. This allowed reﬂection and transmission
measurements. The signal propagation was measured using a Vector Network Anal-
yser (NanoVNA-F V2, Amazon Plc, UK [25]). The instrument’s maximum output
powerdependsonthefrequencyandisbetween−14dBmand−19dBm.Thedynamic
range for reﬂection measurements (S11) is 70dB or better up to 1.5GHz and 60dB
or better up to 1.5GHz to 3GHz.
The Vector Network Analyser (VNA) was regularly calibrated to maintain accu-
racy involving short-circuit, 50 load, and open termination, followed by a direct
connection between ports (inside the RF-chamber). VNA was connected to the native
NanoVNA-QT VNA Saver (V 0.5.3) software package on a Windows computer to
control functionality and store measurements.

The LCR meter estimates a series resistance (R) and a series capacitance (Cs) equiv-
alent model as shown in Fig. 3 for the mycelium substrate.
The electrical impedance Z( f ) = R +

jωCs of the fruiting body (cap and stalk)
decreased with increasing frequency over 20Hz to 300kHz range. The impedance
of mycelium-bound composite also decreased but at a considerably slower rate, see
Fig. 4. The stalk of the fruiting body has a higher electrical impedance than the cap.
The axial impedance of cap is lower than the radial impedance at lower frequencies

becoming similar ∼300kHz. This trend shows that mycelium-bound composites
demonstrate lower impedance at higher frequencies.
A summary of other electrical properties of mycelium-bound composites and
fungal fruiting bodies is shown in Table 1. The fruiting body’s stalk has less than
half the capacitance, more than twice the inductance, and lower steady-state DC
resistance of the cap (both radial and axial). The steady-state DC resistance of the
colonised substrate is higher than the fruiting body.
Using the lump model of the fruiting body and the colonised substrate, we have
carried out SPICE S-parameter simulation to understand the frequency dependant
characteristics of the mycelium substrate for signal transfer characteristics. Figure 5
depict the S-parameter simulation of the lump model for the return loss (S11) and
the gain (S21) for different cases. In very low frequencies up to 100 kHz, a signif-
icant amount of the signal is reﬂected back to the source and the amount of signal
transferred through the substrate is very low. However, starting from around 1 MHz
onward the return loss becomes negative around −0.1 to −0.5 which is still higher
in comparison to a normal conductive substrate.

Electrical Properties of Mycelium-Bound Composites
and Fungal Fruiting Bodies Over the 10Hz to 4MHz
Frequency Range
The signal propagation passing through mycelium-bound composite was frequency
dependent; the lower frequency waveforms passed through with little attenuation
while the higher frequencies became increasingly attenuated. The magnitude fre-
quency proﬁle matched that of a low pass ﬁlter; the phase response also appeared to
correlate with a typical low pass ﬁlter. The Bode plot of mycelium-bound composite,
see Fig. 6, shows the level of attenuation increased noticeably above 100kHz (e.g.
−8dB at 1MHz). The phase decreases noticeably above 10 kHz.
The Bode plots of ﬁve species of fungal fruiting bodies are shown in Fig. 7.
For measurement consistency, the electrodes (with 20 mm spacing) were normally
inserted into the caps of the fruiting bodies. However, the smaller physical size of
Hypsizygus tessellatus meant that in one recording both electrodes were inserted
into the stalk, and for a second recording one electrode was in the stalk and one in

the cap. The mean cut-off frequency was between 5kHz to 50kHz (depending on
species); −20dB/decade to −30dB/decade roll-off, with mean attenuation across the
pass band of ∼−3dB.
To support the analysis of material properties (attenuation and phase against fre-
quency) six conﬁgurations were measured: well colonised substrate Pleurotus ostrea-
tus on Rye seeds, blocks of 100 g and 750 g), uncolonised substrate (Rye seeds ∼66 %
moisture content and Rye seeds with 2ml of mains water 10M cm added to increase
moisture content to ∼76 %, in 50ml glass beakers) and open cell polyurethane foam
(with 2ml de-ionised water 10M cm and 2ml mains water 0.0025M cm, in 50ml
glass beakers), see Fig. 8.
It was observed during measurements that the cap and stalk of fruiting bodies can
have signiﬁcantly different electrical properties. By way of example, Fig. 9 shows
an exemplar of sequential recording from the same Agaricus bisporus fruiting body.
It was not possible to measure some species as their stalks were physically too small
to accommodate electrodes with 20 mm separation.

The moisture content of mycelium-bound substrates and fruiting bodies was deter-
mined by the following procedure: (1) measure the ‘wet’ weight of the sample (2)
dehydrate the sample in an oven at 80 ◦C for ∼48h (3) measure the ‘dry’ weight of
the sample (4) calculate the difference between ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ weights then dividing
by the ‘dry’ weight.
Overall, electrical characteristics were observed to vary with electrode separation.
A distance of ∼20 mm between centres of electrodes was found to be effective for
most measurements. This suggests that there is an optimum spacing for the elec-
trodes in any environment. Optimising the relative physical positions of electrodes
in colonised substrate and fungal fruiting bodies is important to maximising the
sensitivity of monitoring and interconnections to other systems.

Obtaining fresh blocks of spawn (e.g. 100g bags) from commercial suppliers at
desired times was challenging (e.g. limited stock availability). Further, most com-
mercial suppliers were unwilling to provide details of substrate composition (beyond
“Rye seeds” as considered a ‘trade secret’). Therefore, variation in substrate might
exist between both batches from the same supplier and different suppliers. The level
of colonisation of blocks varied greatly between suppliers and times of recordings
as the fungi consumed the substrate as a source of nutrients. Additionally, the het-
erogeneous mixture of substrate and fungi added an additional variable.

Discussion
With 80% moisture content, the growth of a strong hypha network through the body
of well-colonised substrate, particularly near the surface of fresh spawn, appears to
signiﬁcantly raise the mean cut-off frequency to >500kHz compared to 10kHz with
bare Rye seeds with 66% moisture content and 50kHz with Rye seeds moistened
with mains water with 76% moisture content.
The lower mean cut-off frequency of fruiting bodies (5kHz to 50kHz depending
on species) may be useful in a variety of applications, including non-computing
electronic circuits (e.g. signal ﬁltering in audio systems). The higher mean cut-
off frequency of mycelium-bound composites might be used in high-speed analog

computer circuits. ‘Switches’ based on regulated development of hypha networks,
for example, might build ultra-low power consumption signal routers.
Living mycelium might be employed for sensing, sensory fusion, and preprocess-
ing. Furthermore, combining mycelium with silicon components (potential on dried
mycelium) may provide innovative analog computing hardware capabilities.
A low pass ﬁlter might be used to establish an upper bound on data processing
rate in any computational, logic gate circuitry incorporated in or produced from the
substrates.

Conclusions
The electrical properties of mycelium-bound composites were investigated in order
to determine their suitability for signal transmission, particularly in electronic sectors
such as bio-hybrid computing systems.
Mycelium-bound composites have low-pass ﬁlter properties, with an average cut-
off frequency of around 500kHz, a roll-off rate of around −14dB/decade, and an
average attenuation inside the pass band of less than 1dB. Fungal fruiting bodies, on
the other hand, have substantially lower average cut-off frequencies that range from
5kHz to 50kHz depending on the species. Their roll-off rates range from −20to
−30decibels per decade, and the typical attenuation inside the pass band is less
than 3decibels. While the mechanism underlying frequency-dependent attenuation
is unknown, the presence of high-water content, which is electrically conductive due
to dissolved ionizable solids (approximately 80% in mycelium-bound composites
and up to 92% in fruiting bodies depending on species), is most likely a major
contributor.
Mycelium-bound composites and fungal fruiting bodies may be useful compo-
nents in analog computing systems. They could, for example, serve as frequency
ﬁlters in oscillator computing and contribute to sensory data processing in edge
computing. Living mycelium could be used in sensing, sensory fusion, and pre-
liminary data processing. Furthermore, the integration of mycelium networks with
silicon components (possibly with dried mycelium) could lead to novel capabilities
in next-generation analogue computing. This research shows that mycelium-bound
composites have signiﬁcant losses in the low-to-high frequency region and have
dielectric characteristics. Despite being considered electrical insulators, the moisture
content may diminish their electrical breakdown voltage, making them unsuitable for
high-voltage applications. While transferring electrical signals through mycelium is
difﬁcult, including conductive particles holds promise for future sustainable elec-
tronic systems [26].

Fungal Computing

Towards Fungal Computer
Andrew Adamatzky
Abstract We propose that fungi Basidiomycetes can be used as computing devices:
information is represented by spikes of electrical activity, a computation is imple-
mented in a mycelium network and an interface is realised via fruit bodies. In a
series of scoping experiments we demonstrate that electrical activity recorded on
fruits might act as a reliable indicator of the fungi’s response to thermal and chemi-
cal stimulation. A stimulation of a fruit is reﬂected in changes of electrical activity
of other fruits of a cluster, i.e. there is distant information transfer between fungal
fruit bodies. In an automaton model of a fungal computer we show how to imple-
ment computation with fungi and demonstrate that a structure of logical functions
computed is determined by mycelium geometry.

Introduction
The fungi is a largest, widely distributed and the oldest group of living organisms [1].
Smallest fungi are microscopic single cells. The largest mycelium belongs to Armil-
laria bulbosa which occupies 15 ha and weights 10 tons [2] and the largest fruit body
belongs to Fomitiporia ellipsoidea which at 20 years old is 11m long, 80cm wide,
5cm thick and has estimated weight of nearly half-a-ton [3]. During last decade
we produced nearly forty prototypes of sensing and computing devices from the
slime mould Physarum polycephalum [4], including shortest path ﬁnders, compu-
tational geometry processors, hybrid electronic devices, see compilation of latest
results in [5]. We found that the slime mould is a convenient substrate for uncon-
ventional computing however geometry of the slime mould’s protoplasmic networks
is continuously changing, thus preventing fabrication of long-living devices, and
the slime mould computing devices are conﬁned to experimental laboratory setups.
Fungi Basidiomycetes are now taxonomically distinct from the slime mould, how-
ever their development and behaviour are phenomenologically similar: mycelium

networks are analogous to the slime mould’s protoplasmic networks, and the fruit
bodies are analogous to the slime mould’s stalks of sporangia. Basidiomycetes are
less susceptible to infections, when cultured indoors, especially commercially avail-
able species, they are larger in size and more convenient to manipulate than slime
mould, and they could be easily found and experimented with outdoors. This make
the fungi an ideal object for developing future living computing devices. Advancing
our recent results on electrical signalling in fungi [6], which in a way is similar to
electrical signalling in plants [7], we are exploring computing potential of fungi in
present chapter.

Mycelium Basis of Fungal Computer
Mycelium propagates by a foraging front and consolidations of mycelial cords behind
the front [11]. The foraging front travels outward and produces fruit bodies (Fig.1ab).
The front is also manifested by rings of increased vegetation and ‘exhausted’ soil
(Fig.1c), see historical overviews in [8, 9]. Propagation/extension of the ring is due
to exhaustion of nutrients necessary for fungi growth.
A mycelial growth pattern is determined by nutritional conditions and tempera-
ture [11–16], as also demonstrated in computer models in [17, 18]. A complexity
of the mycelium network, as estimated by a fractal dimension, is determined by the
nutrient availability and the pressure built up between various parts of the mycelial
network [19] In domains with high concentration of nutrients mycelia branch, in
poor nutrient domains mycelia stop branching [20]. As indicated in [13] optimisation
of resources is evidenced by inhibitory effect of contact with baits on the remain-
der of the colony margin, regression of mycelium originating from the inoculum
associated with the renewed growth from the bait, and differences between growth
patterns of large and small inocula/baits (Fig.1d). Optimisation of the mycelial net-
work [15] is quite similar to that of the slime mould P. polycephalum, as evidenced
in our previous studies, esp. in terms of proximity graphs [21] and transport net-
works [22]. Exploration of conﬁned spaces by hyphae has been studied in [23–27],
and evidences of the efﬁciency of the exploration provided. All the above indicates
that (1) fungal mycelium can solve the same range of computational geometry prob-
lems as the slime mould P. polycephalum does [5]: shortest path [28–32], Voronoi
diagram [33], Delaunay triangulation, proximity graphs and spanning tree, concave
hull and, possibly, convex hull, and, with some experimental efforts, travelling sales-
man problem [34], and (2) by changing environmental conditions we can reprogram
a geometry and graph-theoretical structure of the mycelium networks and then utilise
electrical activity of fungi [6, 35, 36] to realise computing circuits.
A mycelium is hidden underground, therefore only conﬁgurations of fruit bod-
ies can be seen as outputs of a geometric computation implemented by propagating
mycelium. Consider the following example of interacting foraging fronts. Propaga-
tion of wave-fronts of fungi at large scale was described by Shantz and Piemeisel
in Yuma, Colorado, on June 1916 [9]. This is illustrated in (Fig.1d). There are

two species of fungi Agaricus campestris and Calvatia ciathyiformi. The ring of
C. ciathyiformi was nearly 65m in diameter with 50 fresh fruits. There are several
smaller rings of A. campestris: in some places they interrupt ‘wave-fronts’ of C.
ciathyiformi growth. In theory, such interaction of wave fronts of different species
can be used to approximate the Voronoi diagram, as have been done previously with
slime mould [33, 37], when planar data points are represented by locations of fungi
inoculates.
Also, notice characteristic location of dry fruits of C. ciathyiformi (blue in
Fig.1bd), this brings in an analogy with excitable medium: the fresh fruits are anal-
ogous to the ‘excitation’ wave-front and the dried fungi to ‘refractory’ tails of the
excitation waves. Fungi rings can extend up to 200 meters diameter [9]. Analogy
between fungi foraging fronts and excitation wave fronts indicate that already algo-
rithms for computing with wave fronts in excitable medium [38, 39] can be realised
with foraging mycelium. Said that, solving geometrical problems with mycelium
networks does not sound feasible, because the mycelium growth rate is very low,
thus a solution of any problem could take weeks and months, if not the years for
problems which spatial representation covers hundreds of meters.
In contrast to the slow growth of mycelium, fungi exhibit an electrical response to
stimulation in a matter of seconds or minutes [6, 35, 36]. Therefore, a computation
using electrical impulses propagating in and modiﬁed by the mycelium networks
seems to be promising. We propose the following architecture of a fungal computer
A (Fig.1h): a mycelium C is a processor, or rather a network of processors, and fruit
bodies D1, D2, . . . comprise I/O interface of the fungal computer. The information
is represented by spikes of electrical potential. Thus a state of Dt
i at a time step t
could be either binary, depending on whether a spike is present or absent at time t,
or multiple valued, depending on a number of spikes in a train, duration of spikes
and their amplitudes. Any fruit body can be considered as input and output and the
fungal computer A: Dt+w = F(D), where w is a positive integer. Details on how
exactly A could compute will be analysed in Sect.4, ﬁrst let us consider, Sect.3, few
examples from laboratory experiments on endogenous spiking, response of fungi to
stimulation and evidences of communication between fruit bodies.

ﬂush is usually provides a maximum yield of fruiting bodies [41] and the growing
mycelium in the substrate was less affected by products of fungi metabolism [42,
43]. Each substrate’s bag was 22cm by 10cm by 10cm, 800–900g in weight. The
bag was cross-sliced 10cm vertical and 8cm horizontal and placed in a cardboard
box with 8cm by 10cm opening. Experiments were conducted at room temperature
in constant (24 h) ambient lighting of 10 lux. Electrical potential of fruit bodies was
recorded from the second-third day of their emergence. Resistance between cap and
stalk of a fruit body was 1.5 M in average, between any two heads in the clus-
ter 2 M (measured by Fluke 8846A). We recorded electrical potential difference
between cap and stalk of the fruit body. We used sub-dermal needle electrodes with
twisted cable2. Recording electrode was inserted into stalk and reference electrode
in the translocation zone, cross-section of a fruit body showing translocation zone,
drawing by Schütte [40], of the cap (Fig.2b); distance between electrodes was 3–
5cm. In each cluster we recorded 4–6 fruit bodies simultaneously (Fig.2a) for 2–3
days. Electrical activity of fruit bodies was recorded with ADC-24 High Resolution
Data Logger3. The data logger employs differential inputs, galvanic isolation and
software-selectable sample rates—these contribute to a superior noise-free resolu-
tion; its 24-bit A/D converter maintains a gain error of 0.1%. Its input impedance
is 2 M for differential inputs, and offset error is 36µV in ±1250 mV range use.
We recorded the electrical activity one sample per second; during the recording the
logger made as many measurements as possible (typically up 600) per second then
saved average value.

Endogenous Spiking
As we previously discussed in [6] fruits show a rich family of endogenous, i.e. not
caused by purposeful stimulation during experiments, spiking behaviour. Spiking
patterns of several types have been observed during simultaneous recording from
the different fruits of the same cluster. Recordings of four fruit bodies during nearly
20h are shown in Fig.3. Most pronounced patterns are the trains of large amplitude
spikes (Fig.3b) and the wave-packets (Fig.3c).
Large amplitude spikes (Fig.3b) have average amplitude 0.77 mV, st. deviation
0.29. The spikes are usually observed in pairs. Average distance between spikes in
a pair is 238 s, st. deviation 81 s. Time interval between two largest, over 0.8 mV,

spikes varies from 20min to 48min. Two wave-packets are shown in Fig.3c. First
wave-packet, roughly 91min long, consists of ten spikes. Their amplitude varies
from 0.05 mV a the beginning to 0.1 mV at the eclipse. Shortest spike is 362 s
duration, longest, in the middle of the waveform is 705 s. Second wave-packet, most
pronounced, consists of 19 spikes and lasts for 163min. Amplitudes of the spikes
vary from 0.05 mV at the beginning of the wave-packet to 0.2 mV in the middle.
Shortest spike is 457 s long, longest spike is 609 s long. Average spike duration is
516 s (σ = 56), average amplitude is 0.12 mV (σ = 0.06).
3.3
Signalling Between Fruits
To check if fruits in a cluster would respond to stimulation of their neighbours
we conducted experiments illustrated in Fig.4. Note, fruits which electrical poten-
tial recorded were not stimulated (Fig.4a). Recording on one of the fruiting bodies
(Ch3) shows periodic oscillations: average amplitude 0.47 mV (σ = 0.19), average
duration of a spike is 1669 s (st. deviation 570), average period 1819 s (st. deviation
847) (Fig.4b). Other recorded fruiting bodies also show substantial yet non-periodic
changes in the electrical potential with amplitudes up to 1 mV. A thermal stimulation,
S1 and S2 in Fig.4b, leads to a temporal disruption of oscillation of the fruit Ch3,
and low amplitude short period spikes in other recorded fruits Ch1, Ch2, Ch4–Ch9.
The response of an intact fruit to stimulation of another fruit with an open ﬂame
consists of a depolarisation c. 0.02 mV amplitude, c. 6 s duration, followed by a
repolarisation c. 0.2 mV amplitude, c. 9 s duration. The depolarisation starts c. 3 s
after start of stimulation. This might indicate that it is caused by action potential-like
fast dynamical changes. High-amplitude repolarisation takes place at c. 13 s after
start of stimulation, when a substantial loci of a fruit cap becomes thermally dam-
aged. Application of ethanol (S3, Fig.4) and salt (S4, Fig.4) leads to 0.15–0.45 mV
drop in electrical potential, recovery occurs in c. 1200 s.
In experiment illustrated in Fig.5 we stimulated fruits with open ﬂame, salt and
sugar, and recorded electrical responses from non-stimulated neighbours. Applica-
tion of sugar did not cause any response, and thus can be seen as a control experi-
ment on mechanical stimulation. There were no responses to a short-term (c. 1–2 s)
mechanical stimulation recorded. Fruits respond to thermal stimulation of a member
of their cluster by a couple of action-potential like impulses (Fig.5b). The amplitude
of the response differ from fruit to fruit, and more likely depends not only on the
distance between the recorded fruit and the stimulated fruit but also on the position
of electrodes. The fruits respond to saline stimulation of their neighbour in a more
uniform manner (Fig.5c). In 12–15 s after application of salt, electrical potential of
the recorded fungi drops by c. 0.2–0.8 mV. The potential recovers in c. 30 s.

To test a response of fruits to environmental changes in the growth substrate we
injected150mLof sodiumchloride(6mg/mL) inthesubstrateandrecordedelectrical
potential of a fruit. The moment of injection is reﬂected in the spike of electrical
potential with amplitude 9 mV. This spike might be caused by mechanical stimulation
of mycelium (Fig.6). Four hours after injection, the recorded fruit exhibited trains
of spiking activity. Amplitude of spikes vary from 0.29 to 12.3 mV, average 4.1 mV

Periods varies from 450 to 2870 s, average duration 953 s (σ = 559). The spikes
might be caused by an osmotic function of mycelium due to saline solution intaken
and transported into the caps of fruits [44] (cited by [7]).

Automaton Model of a Fungal Computer
To imitate propagation of depolarisation waves in the mycelium network we adopt
an automaton model. The automaton models are proved to be an appropriate dis-
crete models for spatially extended excitable media [45–47] and veriﬁed in models
of calcium waves propagation [48], propagation of electrical pulses in the heart

[49–51] and simulation of action potential [52, 53]. We represent a fungal computer
by an automaton A = ⟨C, Q,r, h, θ, δ⟩, where C ⊂R is a planar set, each point
p ∈C takes states from the set Q = {⋆, •, ◦}, excited (⋆), refractory (•), resting (◦),
and updates its state in a discrete time depending on its current state and state of its
neighbourhood u(p) = {q ∈C : d(p, q) ≤r}; r is a neighbourhood radius, θ is an
excitation threshold and δ is refractory delay. All points update their states in parallel
and by the same rule:

Every resting (◦) point of C excites (⋆) at the moment t + 1 if a number of its excited
neighbours at the moment t—σ(p)t = |{q ∈u(p) : qt = ⋆}|—exceeds a threshold
θ. Excited point pt = ⋆takes refractory state • at the next time step t + 1, at the
same moment a counter of refractory state h p is set to the refractory delay δ. The
counter is decremented, ht+1
p
= ht
p −1 at each iteration until it becomes 0. When
the counter h p becomes zero the point p returns to the resting state ◦.
Architecture of C was chosen as following. We randomly distributed 2 · 104 points
in a ring with small radius R = 0.5 and large radius 1 (Fig.7a). To reﬂect higher
density of mycelium near the propagation front and decay of mycelium inside the
propagating disc we distributed points with a probability described by a quadratic
function p(R) = 3.7 · R2 −3.6 · R + 0.9, where R ∈[0.5, 1] (Fig.7b); the function
reﬂects biomass distribution in a cross-section of a fairy ring [54, 55]. To imitate
fruit bodies we distributed points in horizontal (L and R) and vertical (U and D)
domains with size 0.27 by 0.023 (Fig.7a); each domain contains 370 points dis-
tributed randomly. Distributions of a point’s number of neighbours for neighbour-
hood radius r = 3, . . . , 15 are shown in Fig.7c. We have chosen θ = 4 (Sect. 4.2.1),
θ = 5 (Sect. 4.2.2), r = 10, δ = 5 in the reported experiments for the following rea-
sons. A median radius r = 10 neighbourhood size is c. 600 times less than a number
of points in C (Fig.7d) thus a locality of the automaton state updates is assured.
Excitation threshold θ = 4 is a critical for A with r = 10 (Fig.7e), i.e. it assures
that excitation waves fronts propagate for at least half of the perimeter of the ring
(Fig.7a).
4.1
Automaton Action Potential
The automaton A supports propagation of excitation waves, fronts of which are
represented by points in the state ⋆and tails by points in state •. We assume a point
in the state ⋆has higher electrical potential than a point in the state •. To imitate a
voltage difference between electrodes inserted in fruit bodies we select two domains
D1 and D2 in each of four fruit bodies and calculate a voltage difference V between
domains as follows: V = 
q∈D1 χ(qt) −
q∈D2 χ(qt), where χ(◦) = 0, χ(⋆) = 1,
and χ(•) = ht
q. This imitates an electrical potential difference between electrodes
inserted in the cap and the step of a fruit, as illustrated in Fig.2.
We excite the fungal automaton A by assigning points of a selected fruit body
states ⋆. This is equivalent to thermal or mechanical stimulation of fruits in our
laboratory experiments. We record voltage on fruit bodies at every iteration of the
automation evolution. Two examples are shown in Fig.8. For simplicity we consider
A with only two fruit bodies: L and R. When right fruit R is stimulated (see ﬁrst
spike in Fig.8c) an excitation wave propagates into the mycelium ring C and splits
into two waves (Fig.8a). Excitation waves enter fruit bodies when reach them, which
is reﬂected in spikes of the calculated potential. If the medium was regular (as e.g.
a lattice) the excitation wave-fronts would annihilate each other when colliding.
However, the disorganised structure of the conductive medium leads to formation

of the new excitation waves (see train of three spikes in Fig.8c). New waves travel
along the ring but eventually die out. Excitation of the left fruit L (Fig.8b) generate
two waves propagating along the ring. However, in this case, due to irregularity of the
excitablemediumatemporarywavegeneratorisbornintheupperpartofthering(2nd
snapshot in Fig.8b). The generator produces pairs of waves (3rd snapshots in Fig.8b).
The transition from sparse spiking to wave-packets is similar to experimental results
shown in Fig.3. In this example we witness that fungal responses to stimulation of the
left and the right fruits are different. This can be employed in desings of computing
schemes with fungal automata, as outlined in next section.
4.2
Logical Functions Computed by A
DynamicsofexcitationwavespropagationandinteractioninCisdeterminedbyexact
conﬁguration of the planar set. The conﬁgurations are generated at random, therefore
we expect fungal automaton to implement different functions for each, or nearly
conﬁguration. This is illustrated by two following examples. Here we use four fruit
bodies acting as both inputs and outputs. A logical input True, or ‘1’, is represented
by excitation of a chosen fruit body. A logical output True, or ‘1’, is recognised as one
or more impulses recorded at the fruit body some time interval after stimulation: we
started recording 40 iterations (this parameter w introduced in Sect.2), of automaton
evolution, after stimulation and stopped recording 130 iterations. Let us consider
two examples. The sets C are generated randomly, therefore dynamics of excitation
is expected to be different in these examples.
4.2.1
First Example
In ﬁrst example we consider the conﬁguration C shown in Fig.9a. Excitation dynam-
ics for inputs R = 0, U = 1, D = 0, L = 1 is shown in Fig.9 and for inputs R = 1,
U = 0, D = 1, L = 0 in Fig.10. When fruits U and D are stimulated (Fig.9) the
fungal automaton A responds with spikes on fruits L and R (Fig.11a). Excitation
dynamics is less trivial when fruits L and R are stimulated (Fig.10): automaton A
responds with two voltage spikes at fruit D, and a single spikes at fruits U and R
(Fig.11b). When only fruit R is stimulated the automaton A responds with pairs of
spikes on all fruits but L (Fig.12b). The automaton A responds with a spike on fruit
L just before cutoff time 150. After 150th iteration two centres of spiral waves are
formed and thus the fungal automaton exhibits regular trains of spikes on all fruit
bodies (Fig.12a), similar to dynamics of excitation shown in Fig.4b.
We stimulated the fungal automaton with sixteen combinations of input variables
and constructed a tabular representation of a function realised by the automaton
(Table1), where R, U, L, D are values of input variables, and R⋆, U⋆, L⋆, D⋆are
values of output variables. Assuming one or two impulses on the fruits represent
True we have the following functions implemented by the fungal automaton

Fig. 14 Dynamics of electrical potential on fruits, in experiment with random seed 357556317,
in response to stimulation of inputs. The inputs are shown in the captions in the format (RU L D).
Spikes appearing during ﬁrst 10–15 iterations are input spikes. All other spikes are outputs. Voltage
recorded on fruit R is plotted with red colour, U blue, L green D magenta
demonstrated that fungi responds with spikes of electrical potential to stimulation
of their fruit bodies. Thus we can input data into a fungal computer via mechanical,
chemical and electrical stimulation of the fruit bodies. Electrical signalling in fungi,
previously evidenced during intracellular recording of electrical potential [35, 36] is
similar to the signalling in plants [7, 56]. The experimental results provided in the
paper are of illustrative nature with focus on architectures of potential computing
devices, a statistical analysis of spontaneous spiking behaviour of the fungi can be

found in [6]. Further extensive studies will be necessary to obtain statistical results
on fungal response to a stimulation, particularly on the response’ dependence on a
strength of stimuli and inter-species differences in their responses.
Voltage spikes travelling along mycelium networks might be seen as analogous,
but of different physical and chemical nature, to oxidation wave-fronts in a thin-layer
Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) medium [57, 58]. Thus, in future, we could draw some
useful designs of fungal computers based on established set of experimental labora-
tory prototypes of of Belousov-Zhabotinsky computing devices. The prototypes pro-
duced are image processes and memory devices [59–61], logical gates implemented
in geometrically constrained BZ medium [62, 63], approximation of shortest path by
excitation waves [64–66], memory in BZ micro-emulsion [61], information coding
with frequency of oscillations [67], on-board controllers for robots [68–70], chemical
diodes [71, 72], neuromorphic architectures [39, 73–77] and associative memory [78,
79], wave-based counters [80], and other information processors [81–84]. First steps
have been already made towards prototyping arithmetical circuits with BZ: simula-
tion and experimental laboratory realisation of gates [38, 62, 63, 85–87], clocks [88]
and evolving logical gates [89]. A one-bit half-adder, based on a ballistic interac-
tion of growing patterns [90], was implemented in a geometrically-constrained light-
sensitive BZ medium [91]. Models of multi-bit binary adder, decoder and comparator
in BZ are proposed in [92–95]. These architectures employ crossover structures as
T-shaped coincidence detectors [96] and chemical diodes [72] that heavily rely on
heterogeneity of geometrically constrained space. By controlling excitability [97] in

different loci of the medium we can achieve impressive results, as it is demonstrated
in works related to analogs of dendritic trees [76], polymorphic logical gates [98],
and experimental laboratory prototype of four-bit input, two-bit output integer square
root circuits based on alternating ‘conductivity’ of junctions between channels [99].
Spikes of electrical potential are not the only means of implementing information
processing in the fungal computers. Microﬂuidics could be an additional compu-
tational resource. Eukaryotic cells, including slime moulds and fungi exhibit cyto-
plasmic streaming [100, 101]. In experiments with slime mould P. polycephalum
we found that when a fragment of protoplasmic tube is mechanically stimulated a
cytoplasmic streaming in this fragment halts and the fragment’s resistance substan-
tially increases. Using this phenomena we designed a range of logical circuits and
memory devices [102]. These designs can be adopted in prototypes of fungal com-
puters, however, more experiments would be necessary to establish optimal ways of
mechanical addressing of strands of mycelium.
5.1
Programmability
To program fungal computers we must control a geometry of mycelium network.
The geometry of mycelium network can be modiﬁed by varying nutritional condi-
tions and temperature [11, 16–18], especially a degree of branching is proportional
to concentration of nutrients [20], and a wide range of chemical and physical stim-
uli [103]. Also, we can geometrically constrain it [23–27]. A feasibility of shaping
similar networks has been demonstrated in [104]: high amplitude high frequency
voltage applied between two electrodes in a network of protoplasmic tubes of P. poly-
cephalum leads to abandonment of the stimulated protoplasmic without affecting the
non stimulated tubes and low amplitude low frequency voltage applied between two
electrodes in the network enhance the stimulated tube and encourages abandonment
of other tubes [104].
5.2
Parameters of Fungal Computers
Interaction of voltage spikes, travelling along mycelium strands, at the junctions
between strands is a key mechanism of the fungal computation. We can see each
junction as an elementary processor of a distributed multi-processor computing net-
work. We assume a number of junctions is proportional to a number of hyphal tips.
There are estimated 10–20 tips per 1.5–3mm [105] of a substrate. Without knowing
depth of the mycelial network we go for a safest lower margin of 2D estimation:
50 tips/mm2. Considering that the largest known fungi Armillaria bulbosa populates
over 15 ha [2] we could assume that there could be 75·1011 branching points, that is
near a trillion of elementary processing units. With regards to a speed of computation
by fungal computers, Olsson and Hansson [36] estimated that electrical activity in

266
A. Adamatzky
fungi could be used for communication with message propagation speed 0.5mm/s
(this is several orders slower than speed of a typical action potential in plants: from
0.005m/s to 0.2m/s [106]). Thus it would take about half-an-hour for a signal in the
fungal computer to propagate one meter. The low speed of signal propagation is not
a critical disadvantage of potential fungal computers, because they never meant to
compete with conventional silicon devices.
5.3
Application Domains
Likely application domains of the fungal devices could be large-scale networks of
mycelium which collect and analyse information about environment of soil and, pos-
sibly, air, and executes some decision making procedures. Fungi “possess almost all
the senses used by humans” [103]. Fungi sense light, chemicals, gases, gravity and
electric ﬁelds. Fungi show a pronounced response to changes in a substrate pH [107],
demonstrate mechanosensing [108]; they sense toxic metals [109], CO2 [110] and
direction of ﬂuid ﬂow [111]. Fungi exhibit thigmotactic and thigmomorphogenetic
responses, which might be reﬂects in dynamic patterns of their electrical activ-
ity [112]. Fungi are also capable for sensing chemical cues, especially stress hor-
mones, from other species [113], thus they might be used as reporters of health and
well-being of other inhabitants of the forest. Thus, fungal computers can be made an
essential part of distributed large-scale environmental sensor networks in ecological
research to assess not just soil quality but an over health of the ecosystems [114–116].
5.4
Further Studies
In automaton models of a fungal computer we shown that a structure of Boolean
functions realised depends on a geometry of a mycelial network. In further studies
we will tackle four aspects of fungal computing as follows.
First, ideas developed in the automaton model of a fungal computer should be
veriﬁed in laboratory experiments with fungi. In the automaton model developed we
did not take into account a full range of parameters recorded during experimental
laboratory studies: origination and propagating of impulses have been imitated in
dynamics of the ﬁnal state machines. To keep the same physical nature of inputs and
outputs we will consider stimulating fruit bodies with alternating electrical current.
To cascade logical circuits implemented in clusters of fruit bodies we might need to
include ampliﬁers in the hybrid fungi based electrical circuits.
Second, in experiments we evidenced electrical responses of fruits to thermal and
chemical stimulation; in some cases we observed trains of spikes. This means we
could, in principle, apply experimental ﬁndings of Physarum oscillatory logic [117],
where logical values are represented by different types of stimuli, apply threshold
operations to frequencies of the electrical potential oscillations, and attempt to imple-

ment logical gates. Another option would be to adopt ideas of oscillatory threshold
logic reported in [118]; however this might require unrealistically precise control of
a geometry of mycelial networks.
Third, we might consider to measure electrical potential between fungal bodies.
In a setup shown in Fig.15ab we recorded electrical potential difference between
neighbouring fruits. Example of the recorded activity is shown in Fig.15b. Average
distance between spikes is 4111 s (σ = 2140). Average duration of a spike is 287 s
(σ = 1515). Average amplitude is 0.25 mV (σ = 0.06). There is a possibility that
patterns of oscillation will be affected by stimulation of other fruit bodies in the
cluster. This might lead to a complementary methods of computing with fungi.
Fourth, we must learn how to program a geometry of mycelial networks to be
able to execute not arbitrary, as demonstrated in the automaton model, but prede-
termined logical circuits. Computer modelling approach may be based on formal
representation of mycelial networks as a proximity graph, e.g. relative neighbour-
hood graph [119] (Fig.16), and then dynamically updating the graph structure till a
desired logical circuit is implemented on the graph. Connection rules in proximity

graphs are ﬁxed, therefore the graph structure can be updated only by adding or
removing nodes. New set of nodes can be added to a living mycelial network by
placing sources of nutrients. However, due to a very slow growth rate of mycelium,
this could be unfeasible. Thus, best way would be to focus only on removing parts of
the mycelial network. When parts of a network are removed the network will re-route
locally, and a set of logical functions implemented by the network will change.

On Boolean Gates in Fungal Colony

Abstract A fungal colony maintains its integrity via ﬂow of cytoplasm along
mycelium network. This ﬂow, together with possible coordination of mycelium tips
propagation, is controlled by calcium waves and associated waves of electrical poten-
tial changes. We propose that these excitation waves can be employed to implement a
computation in the mycelium networks. We use FitzHugh-Nagumo model to imitate
propagation of excitation in a single colony of Aspergillus niger. Boolean values are
encoded by spikes of extracellular potential. We represent binary inputs by electri-
cal impulses on a pair of selected electrodes and we record responses of the colony
from sixteen electrodes. We derive sets of two-inputs-on-output logical gates imple-
mentable the fungal colony and analyse distributions of the gates.

Introduction
A vibrant ﬁeld of unconventional computing aims to employ space-time dynamics of
physical, chemical and biological media to design novel computational techniques,
architectures and working prototypes of embedded computing substrates and devices.
Interaction-based computing devices, is one of the most diverse and promising fam-
ilies of the unconventional computing structures. They are based on interactions of
ﬂuid streams, signals propagating along conductors or excitation wave-fronts, see
e.g. [1–3, 3–9, 9–12]. Typically, logical gates and their cascade implemented in
an excitable medium are ‘handcrafted’ to address exact timing and type of interac-
tions between colliding wave-fronts [1, 2, 13–23]. The artiﬁcial design of logical
circuits might be suitable when chemical media or functional materials are used.
However, the approach might be not feasible when embedding computation in living
systems, where the architecture of conductive pathways may be difﬁcult to alter or
control. In such situations an opportunistic approach to outsourcing computation can

be adopted. The system is perturbed via two or more input loci and its dynamics if
recorded at one or more output loci. A wave-front appearing at one of the output
loci is interpreted as logical truth or ‘1’. Thus the system with relatively unknown
structure implements a mapping {0, 1}n →{0, 1}m, where n is a number of input loci
and m is a number of output loci, n, m > 0 [24, 25]. The approach belong to same
family of computation outsourcing techniques as in materio computing [26–30] and
reservoir computing [31–35].
Fungal colonies are characterised by rich typology of mycelium networks [36–
40] in some cases afﬁne to fractal structures [41–46]. Rich morphological features
might imply rich computational abilities and thus worse to analyse from realising
Boolean functions point of view. In numerical experiments we study implementation
of logical gates via interaction of numerous travelling excitation waves, seen as as
action potentials, on an image of a real fungal colony. Action potential-like spikes of
electrical potential have been discovered using intra-cellular recording of mycelium
of Neurospora crassa [47] and further conﬁrmed in intra-cellular recordings of
action potential in hypha of Pleurotus ostreatus and Armillaria bulbosa [48] and
in extra-cellular recordings of fruit bodies of and substrates colonized by mycelium
of Pleurotus ostreatus [49] (Fig.1). While the exact nature of the travelling spikes
remains uncertain we can speculate, by drawing analogies with oscillations of elec-
trical potential of slime mould Physarum polycephalum [50–53], that the spikes in
fungi are triggered by calcium waves, reversing of cytoplasmic ﬂow, translocation of
nutrients and metabolites. Studies of electrical activity of higher plants can brings us
even more clues. Thus, the plants use the electrical spikes for a long-distance com-
munication aimed to coordinate an activity of their bodies [54–56]. The spikes of
electrical potential in plants relate to a motor activity [57–60], responses to changes
in temperature [61], osmotic environment [62] and mechanical stimulation [63, 64].

Methods
2.1
Colony Imaging
Aspergillus niger strain AR9#2 [65], expressing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)
from the glucoamylase (glaA) promoter, was grown at 30oC on minimal medium
(MM) [66] with 25 mM xylose and 1.5% agarose (MMXA). MMXA cultures were
grown for three days, after which conidia were harvested using saline-Tween (0.8%
NaCl and 0.005% Tween-80). 250 ml liquid cultures were inoculated with 1.25 · 109
freshly harvested conidia and grown at 200 rpm and 30oC in 1L Erlenmeyer ﬂasks in
complete medium (CM) (MM containing 0.5% yeast extract and 0.2% enzymatically
hydrolyzed casein) supplemented with 25 mM xylose (repressing glaA expression).
Mycelium was harvested after 16h and washed twice with PBS. Ten g of biomass
(wet weight) was transferred to MM supplemented with 25 mM maltose (inducing
glaA expression).
Fluorescence of GFP was localised in micro-colonies using a DMI 6000 CS
AFC confocal microscope (Leica, Mannheim, Germany). Micro-colonies were ﬁxed
overnight at 4oC in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed twice with PBS and taken
up in 50 ml PBS supplemented with 150 mM glycine to quench autoﬂuorescence.
Micro-colonies were then transferred to a glass bottom dish (Cellview™, Greiner
Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany, PS, 35/10 MM) and embedded in 1% low melting
point agarose at 45oC. Micro-colonies were imaged at 20× magniﬁcation (HC PL
FLUOTAR L 20 × 0.40 DRY). GFP was excited by white light laser at 472nm using
50% laser intensity (0.1 kW/cm2) and a pixel dwell time of 72 ns. Fluorescent light
emission was detected with hybrid detectors in the range of 490–525 nm. Pinhole
size was 1 Airy unit. Z-stacks of imaged micro-colonies were made using 100 slices
with a slice thickness of 8.35 µm. 3D projections were made with Fiji [67].
2.2
Numerical Modelling
We used still image of the colony as a conductive template. The image of the fungal
colony (Fig.2a) was projected onto a 1000 × 960 nodes grid. The original image
M = (mi j)1≤j≤ni,1≤j≤n j , mi j ∈{ri j, gi j, bi j}, where ni = 1000 and n j = 960, and
1 ≤r, g, b ≤255 (Fig.2a), was converted to a conductive matrix C = (mi j)1≤i, j≤n
(Fig.2b) derived from the image as follows: mi j = 1 if ri j < 20, gi j > 40 and bi j <
20; a dilution operation was applied to C.
FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) equations [68–70] is a qualitative approximation of the
Hodgkin-Huxley model [71] of electrical activity of living cells:

is approximated by Du∇2, where Du is a conductance. Detailed explanations of the
‘mechanics’ of the model are provided in [72], here we shortly repeat some insights.

The term Du∇2u governs a passive spread of the current. The terms c2u(u −a)(1 −
u) and b(u −v) describe the ionic currents. The term u(u −a)(1 −u) has two stable
ﬁxed points u = 0 and u = 1 and one unstable point u = a, where a is a threshold
of an excitation.
We integrated the system using the Euler method with the ﬁve-node Laplace
operator, a time step t = 0.015 and a grid point spacing x = 2, while other
parameters were Du = 1, a = 0.13, b = 0.013, c1 = 0.26. We controlled excitability
of the medium by varying c2 from 0.05 (fully excitable) to 0.015 (non excitable).

The waves of excitation propagated on conductive nodes of the grid of C, in
addition to the parameter c2, excitability of each conductive node was dependent on
a number k of its immediate conductive neighbours. Distribution of neighbourhood
sizes are shown in Fig.2c.
To show dynamics of excitation in the network we simulated electrodes by calcu-
lating a potential pt
x at an electrode location x as px = 
y:|x−y|<2(ux −vx). Con-
ﬁguration of electrodes 1, · · · , 16 is shown in Fig.2d. The conﬁguration selected
imitates a micro-electrode array. The numerical integration code written in Process-
ing was inspired by previous methods of numerical integration of FHN and our own
computational studies of the impulse propagation in biological networks [25, 70,
72–74]. Time-lapse snapshots provided were recorded at every 100th time step, and
we display sites with u > 0.04; videos and ﬁgures were produced by saving a frame
of the simulation every 100th step of the numerical integration and assembling the
saved frames into the video with a play rate of 30fps. Videos are available at [75].

Results
While implementing numerical experiments we selected a range of the network
excitability (Sect. 3.1) and then realised sets of logical gates for excitability values
selected (Sect. 3.2).
3.1
Effect of Excitability on Overall Activity
For c2 < 0.0945 any source of excitation triggers excitation dynamics which occu-
pies all parts of the network accessible, via mycelial strands, from the source. Due
to the high level of excitability the network remains in the excitable state (Fig.3a).
For values c2 from 0.094 to 0.0965 we observe propagation of ‘classical’ excitation
wave-fronts resembling circular, target and spiral waves in a continuous medium.
Examples of wave-fronts propagating in networks with excitability levels c2 = 0.095
and c2 = 0.096, excited at the same loci shown in Fig.4a, are shown in Figs.4
and 5. In the network with c2 there are many pathways for propagation of the exci-

tation wave-fronts, therefore, despite being fully deterministic, the network exhibit
disordered oscillations of its activity (Fig.3c). A number of conductive pathways
decreases when c2 increases from 0.095 to 0.096. Thus many propagating wave-
fronts become, relatively, quickly conﬁned to a limited domains of the network,
where they continue ‘circling’ indeﬁnitely. A set of regular oscillations of activity
becomes evidence after a number of iterations (Fig.3d). The coverage of the network
by excitation wave-fronts reduced with increase of c2 from 0.095 to 0.096 (Fig.6a,
b) and becomes localised when c2 reaches 0.097 (Figs.6c and 3b). Thus we used
networks with c2 = 0.095 or 0.096 for implementation of Boolean functions.
3.2
Distribution of Boolean Gates
Input Boolean values are encoded as follows. We earmark two sites of the network as
dedicated inputs, x and y, and represent logical True, or ‘1’, as an excitation, or an
impulse injected in the network via electrodes. If x = 1 then the site corresponding
to x is excited, if x = 0 the site is not excited (Fig.8).
Assume that each spike represents logical True and that spikes occurring within
less than 2 · 102 iterations happen simultaneously. By selecting speciﬁc intervals of

dashed line, (10), red dotted line, (11), solid green line, entered as impulses via electrodes Ex = 5
and Ey = 15. See locations of electrodes in Fig.2d. To make the individual plots visible in places
of exact overlapping, we added potential −5 to recording in response to input (01) and and potential
5 to recording in response to input (11)
recordings we can realise several gates in a single site of recording. In this particular
case we assumed that spikes are separated if their occurrences lie more than 103
iterations apart. An example is shown in Fig.7.
Numbers of Boolean gates detected on the electrodes for selected pairs of input
electrodes are shown in Table1. We see that select x and select y gates, Sx and Sy
are most frequent. They usually are detected with the same frequency (Table1d–f),
however there are examples of input electrode pairs, where one of the select gates
is found much more often than another. This is most visible for the pair (Ex, Ey) =
(3, 13) where Sx dominates (Table1a), and the pair (7, 14) and (Table1bc) where
Sy dominates. Next common gates in the hierarchy are x y and x y. The gates xy and
x + y are detected with nearly the same frequency with gate x + y being slightly
more common. The x ⊕y is the most rare gate.
The sub-tables Table1d–f show how excitability of the network affects numbers
of gates detected. The networks with high excitability, c2 = 0.094, and low excitabil-
ity, c2 = 0.0096 realise smaller number of gates then that realised by sub-excitable
network, c2 = 0.095.
Overall distribution (average of outputs of input electrode pairs (3,13), (5,15),
(7,14), (4,13), (13,7)) of a ratio of gates discovered is shown in Fig.9. This is accom-
panied by distributions of gates discovered in experimental laboratory reservoir com-
puting with slime mould Physarum polycephalum [76], succulent plant [77] and
numerical modelling experiments on computing with protein verotoxin [78], actin
bundles network [24], and actin monomer [79]. All the listed distributions have very

Discussion
We have demonstrated how sets of logical gates can be implemented in single colony
mycelium networks via initiation of electrical impulses. The impulses travel in the
network, interact with each other (annihilate, reﬂect, change their phase). Thus for
different combinations of input impulses and record different combinations of output
impulses, which in some cases can be interpreted as representing two-inputs-one-
output functions.
To estimate a speed of computation we refer to Olsson and Hansson’s [48] original
study, in which they proposed that electrical activity in fungi could be used for
communication with message propagation speed 0.5mm/s. Diameter of the colony
(Fig.2a), which experimental laboratory images has been used to run FHN model,
is c. 1.7mm. Thus, it takes the excitation waves initiated at a boundary of the colony
up to 3–4 s to span the whole mycelium network (this time is equivalent to c. 70K
iterations of the numerical integration model). In 3–4 sec the mycelium network can
compute up to a hundred logical gates. This gives us the rate of a gate per 0.03 s, or,
in terms of frequency this will be c. 30Hz. The mycelium network computing can

not compete with existing silicon architecture however its application domain can
be a unique of living biosensors (a distribution of gates realised might be affected by
environmental conditions) [80] and computation embedded into structural elements
where fungal materials are used [81–83].

Electrical Frequency Discrimination
by Fungi Pleurotus Ostreatus
Dawid Przyczyna, Konrad Szacilowski, Alessandro Chiolerio,
and Andrew Adamatzky
Abstract We stimulate mycelian networks of oyster fungi Pleurotus ostreatus with
low frequency sinusoidal electrical signals. We demonstrate that the fungal networks
can discriminate between frequencies in a fuzzy-like or threshold based manner.
Details about the mixing of frequencies by the mycelium networks are provided.
The results advance the novel ﬁeld of fungal electronics and pave ground for the
design of living, fully recyclable, electron devices.

Introduction
Fungal electronics aims to design bio-electronic devices with living networks of fun-
gal mycelium [1] and proposes novel and original designs of information and signal
processing systems. The living fungal electronic devices offer fault-tolerance and
self-repairability featured in living systems, non-linear electrical properties (mem-
fractance, capacitance, photoreactance, electrical oscillations) necessary for imple-
menting analog electronic, neuromorphic and even digital (spike based) circuits, and
the fungal circuits are capable of electrical responding to mechanical, optical, chemi-
cal and electrical stimulation. Mycelium bound composites (grain or hemp substrates
colonised by fungi) are environmentally sustainable growing bio-materials [2–4].
They have been already used in insulation panels [5–9], packaging materials [10,
11], building materials and architectures [12] and wearables [2, 13–16]. To make
the fungal materials functional we need to embed ﬂexible electronic devices into the
materials. Hyphae of fungal mycelium spanning the mycelium bound composites

can play a role of unconventional electronic devices. interestingly, their topology is
very similar to conducting polymer dendrites [17, 18]. These properties originate
not only from common topology [19] but also from complex charge carrier trans-
port phenomena. Therefore, it is not surprising that electrical properties of mycelial
hyphae and conducting polymer ﬁlaments have similar electrical properties: pro-
ton hopping and ionic transport in hyphae verses ionic and electronic transport in
polymers. Such transport duality must result in highly nonlinear voltage/current char-
acteristics, which in turn, upon AC stimulation must result in generation of complex
Fourier patterns in resulting current, as well as other phenomena relevant from the
point of view of unconventional computing, e.g. stochastic resonance [20].
We have already demonstrated that we achieved in implementing memristors [21],
oscillators [22], photo-sensors [23], pressure sensors [24], and Boolean logical cir-
cuits [25] with living mycelium networks. Due to nonlinead electric response of
fungal tissues, they are ideally suited for transformation of low-frequency AC sig-
nals. The study presented is devoted to frequency discriminators and transformers,
which are a signiﬁcant contribution to the ﬁeld of fungal electronics.
Electrical communication in mycelium networks is an almost unexplored topic.
Fungi exhibit oscillations of extracellular electrical potential, which can be recorded
via differential electrodes inserted into a substrate colonised by mycelium or directly
into sporocarps [26–28]. We used iridium-coated stainless steel sub-dermal nee-
dle electrodes (Spes Medica S.r.l., Italy), with twisted cables. In experiments with
recording of electrical potential of oyster fungi Pleurotus djamor we discovered two
types of spiking activity: high-frequency 6 mHz and low-freq 1 mHz [28] ones.
While studying other species of fungi, Ganoderma resinaceum, we found that the
most common signature of an electrical potential spike is 2–3 mHz [22]. In both
species of fungi we observed bursts of spikes within trains of impulses similar to that
observed in animal central nervous system [29, 30]. In [31] we demonstrated that
information-theoretical complexity of fungal electrical activity exceeds the complex-
ity of European languages. In [32] we analysed the electrical activity of Omphalotus
nidiformis, Flammulina velutipes, Schizophyllum commune and Cordyceps militaris.
We assumed that the spikes of electrical activity could be used by fungi to communi-
cate and process information in mycelium networks and demonstrated that distribu-
tions of fungal word lengths match that of human languages. Taking all the above into
account it would be valuable to analyse the electrical reactions of fungi to strings of
electrical oscillations, featuring frequencies matching those of the supposed fungal
language.

(purchased by Spes Medica S.r.l., Italy), with twisted cables. Signal was applied
with 4050B Series Dual Channel Function/Arbitrary Waveform Generators (B&K
Precision Corporation) with a 16-bit vertical resolution. Signals featuring a series
of frequencies—1–10 mHz with a 1 mHz step and 10–100 mHz with a 10 mHz
step—have been applied between two points of the fungi and measured with two dif-
ferential channels on ADC-24 (purchased by Pico Technology, UK) high-resolution
data logger with a 24-bit analog-to-digital converter. We have chosen these particu-
lar intervals of frequencies because they well cover frequencies of action-potential
spiking behaviour of a range of fungi species [22, 28, 32].

Finally, mixing of signals was performed for 1 mHz base frequency applied on Path
1 and a series of frequencies on the Path 2. Frequencies used on Path 2 are 2, 5
and 7 mHz). Fast Fourier transform (FFT) was calculated with Origin Pro software.
Blackman window function was used as it is best suitable for the representation of
amplitudes [33]. Fuzzy sets for inference of new input data were constructed using
“fuzzylogic 1.2.0” Python package.

Results
A response of the fungi sample to electrical stimulation is shown in Fig.1a. In all mea-
surements, electrical activity with frequency 50–200 mHz was observed even when
substrates were not stimulated. This activity is attributed to endogenous oscillations
of electrical potential of fungi [22, 28, 32].
Exemplary generations of higher harmonics are shown in Fig.2b. In some cases
presented on Fig.3, 2nd harmonic is more damped than the 3rd harmonic. Generally,
for frequencies below 10 mHz, higher amplitudes were observed for 3rd harmonic
versus the 2nd.

Fig. 4 Harmonic distributions. a Normalised ratios of 2nd verses 3rd harmonics for analysed
signals. Straight line marks threshold frequency. b Total Harmonic Distortion calculated for fungi
sample. Proposition of the fuzzy sets is included in the background
The ratio of the 2nd to 3rd harmonic amplitudes was calculated to better illustrate
the changes between them (Fig.4a). The calculated ratios were then normalised to
the ratio of harmonics at 10mHz. Points at 30 and 50 mHz in 1 path, and 2 channel
were treated as outliers because the ratios at these frequencies were disproportionally
larger than those at other frequencies, which disturbed data visualisation. Besides,
the omitted data points in the presented graph still support the observation that in
general, below 10 mHz, the ratio of the 2nd and 3rd harmonics are smaller than for
higher frequencies.
In the next step, Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the measured signal was
calculated (Fig.4b). THD is the ratio between the fundamental frequency amplitude
V0 and the amplitude of higher harmonics Vn:
THDF =

V 2
2 + V 2
3 + V 2
4 + . . .
V1
(1)
where V n is the nth amplitude of the frequency of successive higher harmonic peaks
observed in the Fourier spectra. Furthermore, normalisation to 100% of the THD
parameter can be applied as follows:
THDR =
THDF

1 + THD2
F
,
(2)
where R in THDR stands for “root mean square”.
For the frequencies below 10 mHz, higher values of THD (up to 45.9%) can be
observed in relation to higher frequencies, which tend to exhibit lower THD val-
ues (below 10%). The THD of a pure signal ranges between different values, for
example a square wave features a THD of 48.3% and a triangular wave features a

298
D. Przyczyna et al.
THD of 12.1%. This result may suggest changes in the dominant conductivity type:
slower signals are more distorted and faster signals are much less distorted. Lower
THD values are obtained, when the generation of higher harmonics of the modulated
signal is low, hence the fungi sample has lower effect on its transformation. This
effect is a consequence of a dual electric charge transport mechanism in mycelium.
Furthermore, the changes occurring at low frequencies indicate, that slow physical
phenomena (as diffusion) are critically responsible for the distortion of electric sig-
nals. This effect is similar to those observed in the case of solid-state memristor,
however in the latter case the dependence is opposite [34]. It can be concluded that
in the studied case at high frequencies only one, faster conductivity mode plays a
signiﬁcant role. Therefore, the nonlinear character of electric transport is much less
pronounced and signal can apparently “ﬂy through” the sample and can be transmit-
ted across a macroscopic distance with low distortion.
As the changes of THD parameter below 10mHz occurs in a rather continuous
manner, arbitrary linguistic (very low, low, medium, high, very high, etc.) could be
deﬁned for ranges of obtained values. To cope with uncertainty of the classiﬁca-
tion, we can employ fuzzy sets theory [35]. Following, membership function could
be speciﬁed for the allocation of data into sets so that fuzziﬁcation of data could
be implemented and allow for inference of given new input data into proper cate-
gory [36]. Proposition for such sets is depicted in the background of Fig.4b. Two
sigmoidal sets were selected for the boundary and three Gaussian sets for the center
of the data.
The results demonstrate that, based on increase of the THD parameter or on the
amplitude values of 2nd and 3rd harmonic components, signal discrimination based
on its frequency could be realised.
After analysis of single signal paths, signals were applied to the two signal paths
at once. Results show that with increasing frequency, further damping of the 2nd
harmonic is achieved. Furthermore, satellite frequencies appear around base fre-
quencies as well as around higher harmonics. For example, on the Fig.5b, for the
mixing of 1 and 5 mHz signal, higher frequencies—9 mHz and 11 mHz—around
damped 10 mHz 2nd harmonic are present. This effect is present as well for the 1 mHz
Fig. 5 Result of frequency mixing in the fungi samples. For each measurement, base 1 mHz driving
signal was used on Path 1 (Fig.1). For each successive measurement, higher frequency signal—2,
5 and 7 mHz—was applied to the Path 2

Electrical Frequency Discrimination by Fungi Pleurotus Ostreatus
299
and 7 mHz mixed frequencies. The results indicate a nontrivial frequency mixing
scheme, which may results in transport phenomena within highly branched network
of mycelial hyphae. Such a transport can be a topic of future experiments [37, 38].
4
Conclusion
We demonstrated that fungal mycelium networks modify frequencies of external
electrical inputs. Damping of 2nd harmonic and ampliﬁcation of the 3nd harmonic
amplitudes below 10mHz allow for frequency discrimination in a threshold manner.
The frequency discrimination could occur in a continuous manner, with the help of
the concepts of fuzzy logic based on THD parameter.

On Electrical Gates on Fungal Colony
Alexander E. Beasley, Phil Ayres, Martin Tegelaar,
Michail-Antisthenis Tsompanas, and Andrew Adamatzky
Abstract Mycelium networks are promising substrates for designing unconven-
tional computing devices providing rich topologies and geometries where signals
propagate and interact. Fulﬁlling our long-term objectives of prototyping electrical
analog computers from living mycelium networks, including networks hybridised
with nanoparticles, we explore the possibility of implementing Boolean logical gates
based on electrical properties of fungal colonies. We converted a 3D image-data stack
of Aspergillus niger fungal colony to an Euclidean graph and modelled the colony
as resistive and capacitive (RC) networks, where electrical parameters of edges were
functions of the edges’ lengths. We found that and, or and and- not gates are
implementable in RC networks derived from the geometrical structure of the real
fungal colony.

Introduction
Fungi are demonstrated to be at the forefront of environmentally sustainable bioma-
terials [1–3] used in manufacturing of acoustic [4–6] and thermal [7–12] insulation
panels,packagingmaterials[13–15]andadaptivewearables[1, 16–19].Inourproject
‘Fungal architectures’ [20] we proposed to grow mycelium bound composites into
monolithic building elements [21]. The composite would combine living mycelium,
capable of sensing light, chemicals, gases, gravity and electric ﬁelds [22–28], with
dead mycelium functionalised using nanoparticles and polymers. These living build-

ing structures would have embedded bioelectronics electronics [29–31], implement
sensorial fusion and decision making in the mycelium networks [32] and be able to
grow monolithic buildings from the functionalised fungal substrate [21].
A decision making feature requires inference logical circuits to be embedded
directly into mycelium bonded composites. To check what range and frequencies of
logical gates could be implemented in the mycelium bound composites we adopted
an approach developed originally in [32, 33]. The technique is based on selecting
a pair of input sites, applying all possible combinations of inputs to the sites and
recording outputs on a set of the selected output sites. The approach belongs to same
family of computation outsourcing techniques as in materio computing [34–38] and
reservoir computing [39–43]. In our previous studies [32] we demonstrated that
logical circuits can be derived from electrical spiking activity of the fungal colony.
The approach, whilst elegant theoretically, might lack practical applications because
the spiking activity of living fungi is of very low frequency, e.g. a spike per 20
min [44, 45]. Thus, we decided to explore electrical properties of the fungal colony,
because the electrical analog implementation of logical gates is notoriously fast. In
the numerical experiments described here, ‘0’ and ‘1’ signals are represented by low
and high voltage applied to the input sites.

Aspergillus niger strain AR9#2 [46], expressing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)
from the glucoamylase (glaA) promoter, was grown at 30 oC on minimal medium
(MM) [47] with 25 mM xylose and 1.5% agarose (MMXA). MMXA cultures were
grown for three days, after which conidia were harvested using saline-Tween (0.8%
NaCl and 0.005% Tween-80). 250 ml liquid cultures were inoculated with 1.25 · 109
freshly harvested conidia and grown at 200 rpm and 30 oC in 1 L Erlenmeyer ﬂasks in
complete medium (CM) (MM containing 0.5% yeast extract and 0.2% enzymatically
hydrolyzed casein) supplemented with 25 mM xylose (repressing glaA expression).
Mycelium was harvested after 16 h and washed twice with PBS. Ten g of biomass
(wet weight) was transferred to MM supplemented with 25 mM maltose (inducing
glaA expression).
Fluorescence of GFP was localised in micro-colonies using a DMI 6000 CS
AFC confocal microscope (Leica, Mannheim, Germany). Micro-colonies were ﬁxed
overnight at 4 oC in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed twice with PBS and taken
up in 50 ml PBS supplemented with 150 mM glycine to quench autoﬂuorescence.
Micro-colonies were then transferred to a glass bottom dish (Cellview™, Greiner
Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany, PS, 35/10 MM) and embedded in 1% low melting
point agarose at 45 oC. Micro-colonies were imaged at 20× magniﬁcation (HC PL
FLUOTAR L 20 × 0.40 DRY). GFP was excited by white light laser at 472 nm using
50% laser intensity (0.1 kW/cm2) and a pixel dwell time of 72 ns. Fluorescent light
emission was detected with hybrid detectors in the range of 490–525 nm. Pinhole
size was 1 Airy unit.

3D projections were made with Fiji [48] (Fig.1). Conversion of the imaged micro-
colonies to graph data was accomplished using a publicly available ImageJ macro.1
The macro was run on the Fiji (ImageJ) platform, version 1.52, with the supple-
mentary 3D ImageJ Suite installed to provide enhanced 3D capabilities [49]. To run
the macro, initialisation parameters for expected hypha radius were given as 3 µm
[50]; detection sensitivity threshold was set to 8; minimal vessel volume was set
to 100 pixels. Key processing tasks performed by the macro were: morphological
closing of tubular structures, pre-ﬁltering to enhance ﬁlamentous voxels, segmen-
tation of tubular structures, skeletonisation and analysis of the network. Results of
the segmentation included a Z-stack 3D visualisation of the network with identiﬁed
branching and end-points, and tabular data including the number of disjoint networks
together with constituent branch segments deﬁned by start and end points given in
voxel coordinates.
The tabular data was then processed using a custom Python script to convert voxel
coordinates to real-world coordinates. The set of all vertices was determined and all
branch start and end points were indexed. A weighted graph was generated using
the NetworkX library for python [51], with graph nodes deﬁned by the vertex index,
edges deﬁned between vertex pairs and edge weights given as the euclidean distance
of the branch segment (Fig. 2). Graph topology could then be determined using the
NetworkX degree function. Shortest weighted paths between source and sink vertices
could also be found, allowing a direct correlation to resistive networks.
The 3D graph was converted to a resistive and capacitive (RC) network, whose
magnitudes are a function of the length of the connections. Resistances were in
the order of kOhms and capacitance were in the order of pF. Separate models were
created with the RC connections modelled either in series or in parallel modules. The
networks were parsed for the order one nodes, which are considered to the extent
of the sample. The positive voltage and ground nodes were randomly assigned from
the sample and 1000 networks are created in each arrangement for analysis. SPICE
analysis consisted of transient analysis using a two voltage pulses of 60 mV on the
randomly assigned positive nodes with the following parameters: Tdelay= 10 s for V1
and20sfor V2, Trise =0.001s, Tfall =0.001s, Ton =10sfor V1 and20sfor V2, Toff =20s
for V1 and 20 s for V2, Ncycles = 2 for V1 and 1 for V2. Circuit analysis was transient
analysis for 40 s in steps of 1 ms. The voltage at each node and current through
each link were measured every 1 ms of the simulation. We modelled the fungal
colony in serial RC networks and parallel RC networks. The output voltages have
been binarised with the threshold θ: V > theta symbolises logical True otherwise
False.

to process Z-stack data for blood vessel segmentation and network analysis, see details

Results
In general, there are 16 possible logical gates realisable for two inputs and one
output. The gates implying input 0 and evoking a response 1, i.e. f (0, 0) = 1, are
not realisable because the fungal circuit simulated is passive. The remaining 8 gates
are and, or, and–not (x and not y and not x and y), select (select x and
select y) and xor.
No xor gates have been found in neither of the RC models of the fungal colony.
In the model of serial RC networks we found gates and, select and and-
not; no or gates have been found. The number n of the gates discovered decreases
by a power low with increase of θ: nand- not = 72 · x−0.98, nselect = 2203 · x−0.48,

number of or gates decreases quadratically and becomes nil when θ > 0.03. The

with increase of θ. The number of select gates reaches its maximum at θ = 0.023,
and then starts to decreases with the further increase of θ: nselect = 9.61 · 106 +

Discussion
By simulating a fungal colony as an electrical network we discovered families of
Boolean gates realisable in the network. Voltage values have been binarised via
threshold θ. All non-active, i.e. f (0, 0) ̸= 1, gates but xor have been discovered
and their dynamics in relation to θ. The systems of gates discovered are functionally
complete and therefore we can speculate that an arbitrary logical circuit can be
realised in living fungal networks by encoding Boolean values in differences of
electrical potential. The xor gates have not been observed in our models. This is
unsurprising as the xor gate is the most rare gate to be discovered in non-linear
systems [52–54]. A disadvantage of the electrical analog logical circuits in living
fungal colonies would be that the colony requires maintenance and have a relatively
short life span. A way forward would be to ‘imprint’ the colony in other long-living
materials. This can be done, for example, by means of biolithography as previously
tested on slime mould Physarum polycephalum [55].

Mining Logical Circuits in Fungi
Nic Roberts and Andrew Adamatzky
Abstract Living substrates are capable for nontrivial mappings of electrical signals
due to the substrate nonlinear electrical characteristics. This property can be used
to realise Boolean functions. Input logical values are represented by amplitude or
frequency of electrical stimuli. Output logical values are decoded from electrical
responses of living substrates. We demonstrate how logical circuits can be imple-
mented in mycelium bound composites. The mycelium bound composites (fungal
materials) are getting growing recognition as building, packaging, decoration and
clothing materials. Presently the fungal materials are passive. To make the fungal
materials adaptive, i.e. sensing and computing, we should embed logical circuits into
them. We demonstrate experimental laboratory prototypes of many-input Boolean
functions implemented in fungal materials from oyster fungi P. ostreatus. We char-
acterise complexity of the functions discovered via complexity of the space-time
conﬁgurations of one-dimensional cellular automata governed by the functions. We
show that the mycelium bound composites can implement representative functions
from all classes of cellular automata complexity including the computationally uni-
versal. The results presented will make an impact in the ﬁeld of unconventional
computing, experimental demonstration of purposeful computing with fungi, and in
the ﬁeld of intelligent materials, as the prototypes of computing mycelium bound
composites.

Introduction
The fungi are one of the largest, the oldest, most adaptive and widely distributed
group of organisms [1]. Smallest fungi are single cells. The largest mycelium spreads
in hectares [2]. When growing in a bulk medium of wood or plant shavings fungi
bind the medium in a solid monolith with outstanding mechanical properties. The

mycelium bound composites are seen as future environmentally sustainable growing
biomaterials [3–6]. They are already used in acoustic [7–9] and thermal [10–15]
insulation panels and cladding, materials for packaging [16–18] and wearables [3,
19–22]. The currently used fungal materials are passive and inert because the fungi
in the composites are dead and treated to prevent decay. To make the fungal materials
adaptive and intelligent we must either (1) leave part of the fungal materials alive,
or (2) dope the materials with functional nanoparticles and polymers.
Why do we need to compute with fungi? The research is undertaken in the frame
for the FUNGAR (www.fungar.eu), acronym for Fungal Architectures, a EU Horizon
2020 research project that seeks to develop a fully integrated structural and compu-
tational living monolith by using fungal mycelium. The goal, to advance towards the
realisation of full-scale intelligent bio-buildings and other functional bio-structures.
Distributions of Boolean gates depends on environmental and physiological con-
ditions of the mycelium bound composites and therefore will provide a computa-
tional characterisation of the fungal material states. This distribution of logical func-
tions will be somewhat analogous to Kolmogorov complexity of the living building
materials.
Fungal colonies are characterised by rich typology of mycelium networks [23–
27] in some cases similar to fractal structures [28–33]. Rich morphological features
might imply rich computational abilities and thus worth to analyse from a realising
Boolean functions point of view. To implement logical functions we adopted a the-
oretical approach developed in [34, 35]. The technique is based on selecting a pair
of input sites, applying all possible combinations of inputs, where logical values are
represented by electrical characteristics of input signals, to the sites and recording
outputs, represented by electrical responses of the substrate, on a set of the selected
output sites. The approach belong to the family of reservoir computing [36–40] and
in materio computing [41–45] techniques of analysing computational properties of
physical and biological substrates.

Methods
A hemp shavings substrate was colonised by the mycelium of the grey oyster fungi, P.
ostreatus (AnnMiller’sSpecialityMushroomsLtd,UK).Recordingswerecarriedout
in a stable indoor environment with the temperature remaining stable at 22 ± 0.5°and
relative humidity of air 40 ± 5%. The humidity of the substrate colonised by fungi
was kept at c. 70–80%.
Hardware was developed that was capable of sending sequences of 4 bit strings to
a mycelium substrate. The strings were encoded as step voltage inputs where –5 V
denoted a logical 0 and 5 V a logical 1. The hardware was based around an Arduino
Mega 2560 (Elegoo, China) and a series of programmable signal generators, AD9833
(Analog, USA). The 4 input electrodes were 1 mm diameter platinum rods inserted
to a depth of 50 mm in the substrate in a straight line with a separation of 20 mm.
Data acquisition (DAQ) probes were placed in a parallel line 50 mm away separated

sequences; CU–control unit, dashed section is a breakdown of a single channel; ADC–analogue to

by 10 mm. The electron sink and source was placed 50 mm on from DAQ probes.
There were 7 DAQ differential inputs from the mycelium substrate to a Pico 24 (Pico
Technology, UK) analogue-to-digital converter (ADC), the 8th channel was used to
pass a pulse to the ADC on every input state change, see Fig. 1 for a schematic of the
apparatus. The substrate and probes were placed in a semi-sealed container. After
each experimental repeat the substrate was sprayed with water, left for an hour and
then the next repeat was conducted. There were a total of 14 repeats.
A sequence of 4 bit strings counting up from binary 0000 to 1111, with a state
change every hour, were passed into the substrate, see Fig. 2 for timing details. In
all 14 repeats of the experiment were done on the same substrate to capture changes
in structure of the growing mycelium. Samples from 7 channels were taken at 1 Hz
over the whole duration of a given experimental run. Peaks for each channel were
located for a set of 32 thresholds, from 20 to 175 mV with step 5 mV, for each input
state, 0000 to 1111.
The voltage spiking events occur at the scale of seconds usually during state
transitions which happen every hour which is in line with the decay time after a
spike. Boolean strings were extracted from the data, where a logic ‘1’ was noted for
a channel if it had a peak outside the threshold band for a particular state else, a value
of ‘0’ was recorded, the polarity of the peak was not considered.
The strings for each experimental repeat were stored in their respective Boolean
table. To extract state graphs, a state/node was deﬁned as the string of output values
from each channel at each input state, transitions/edges were deﬁned as a change
in input state. This led to a total of 448 state graphs. The sum of products (SOP)

Boolean functions were calculated for each output channel. For each repeat there
were 7 channels and 32 thresholds giving total of 3136 individual truth tables.
See Fig. 3 for SOP extraction. If a peak is found in Fig. 3a during an input state

Results
We have discovered total of 3136 4-inputs-1-output Boolean functions. Figure 4
shows the Boolean function distribution. The two peak values were logical False,
n = 238, and logical True, n = 237. The highest occurring non-trivial gate was A +
B + C + D, n = 145. The top 16 occurring non-trivial Boolean functions are listed
in Table 1. The only single gate functions found were for nand (A + B + C + D),
n = 145, or (A + B + C + D), n = 46, and and (ABC D), n = 8.
Let us discuss complexity of the functions discovered (Table 1) via complexity
of the space-time conﬁgurations of one-dimensional cellular automata governed by
the functions. We consider an array Z of ﬁnite state machines, called cells, where
every cell takes states ‘0’ or ‘1’ and updates its state depending on the states of
its four immediate neighbours. All cells update their states by the same rule and in
discrete time. For example, a cell with index i, xi ∈Z, updates its state at time t
as a function of states of its four neighbours: xt+1 = f (xt
i−2, xt
i−1, xt
i+1, xt
i+2). To
map functions from Table 1 to the rules governing the cellular automata we assume
that A corresponds to xt
i−2, B to xt
i−1, C to xt
i+1 and D to xt
i+1. For example, a cell
xi of cellular automaton governed by the function F5 (Table 1) updates its state as
xt+1 = xi−2xi−1 + xi+1xi+2 + xi−2xi+2.

the ’deﬂation’ algorithm used in PNG lossless compression [46–48] is a variation
of the classical Lempel–Ziv 1977 algorithm [49]. The frequency of the functions
occurrence in the experimental circuit mining versus L Z complexity of the func-
tions is shown in Fig. 6. We can see that there is no correlation between how often a
function can be found and how complexity the function is. Thus, e.g. the function F13
(Table 1) generates most complex space-time conﬁguration (Fig. 5i) yet it is in the
mid-range of the frequency of experimental occurrence. The less complex functions
F5, F7, F12, F15 span the interval [29, 55] counts of occurrences in experimental
laboratory mining.
Let us consider positions of the functions Table 1 in the Wolfram classiﬁcation [50]
of cellular automaton behaviour. Functions F1, F6, F8, F9 and F11 belong to the class
I, the class of automata exhibiting a dull dynamics and evolving to a stable state where
all cells are in the same state. Functions F2, F7, F12, F14, F15 belong to the class

II: the automata fall into global cells do not update their state or update them cycli-
cally from ‘0’ to ‘1’. Functions F4, F10 and F13 belong to class III: the space-time
dynamics is characterised by quasi-random behaviour and difﬁcult predictability of
the successions of the global states. These functions generate the most complex, as
evaluated by L Z measure, space-time conﬁgurations. Function F2 shows an inter-
esting example of the function belonging to classes II and III. Two functions F3 and
F16 belong to class IV: the space-time dynamics of automata show gliders (compact
patterns translating in space) with non-trivial interactions between the gliders. The
automata governed by rules F3 and F16 are computationally universal, because it is
possible to implement an arbitrary logical circuit via collisions between the gliders,
see e.g. [51, 52].

Discussion
Mycelium bound composites transform electrical signals in a non-linear manner due
to mem-fractive and capacitive properties of the fungal tissue [53]. Whilst exact bio-
physical mechanisms of the signal transformation by the mycelium remain unknown
we can explore the non-linear properties of this living substrate to implement logical
circuits. In experimental laboratory studies we demonstrated that mycelium bound
composites implement a wide range of Boolean circuits. Analyses of the functions
extracted in terms of space-time dynamics of cellular automata helped us to order the
functions in several classes of complexity and pinpoint the functions supporting a
universal computation. It would be possible to concatenate outputs from the different
channels to create another layer of logic gate outputs. The current study looked at
single output systems via SOP but the potential of using multiple outputs in parallel
is there.
The ﬁrst ever prototype of the fungal reservoir computer, presented in the chapter,
demonstrates that a computation can be embedded into living materials. The research

presented also pinpointed a high degree of variability in the logical circuits imple-
mented by the fungi. This is because the live mycelium remain in the continuous
process of growth and reconﬁguration. To decrease the variability of the results we
could consider to functionalise the mycelium networks with semi-conductive parti-
cles and polymers and allow the mycelium to dry. The resulting networks will have
a permanent structure which will guarantee repeatability of the experimental circuits
discovered. This will be a topic of our future studies.

Abstract We study a cellular automaton (CA) model of information dynamics on a
single hypha of a fungal mycelium. Such a ﬁlament is divided in compartments (here
also called cells) by septa. These septa are invaginations of the cell wall and their
pores allow for ﬂow of cytoplasm between compartments and hyphae. The septal
pores of the fungal phylum of the Ascomycota can be closed by organelles called
Woronin bodies. Septal closure is increased when the septa become older and when
exposed to stress conditions. Thus, Woronin bodies act as informational ﬂow valves.
The one dimensional fungal automata is a binary state ternary neighbourhood CA,
where every compartment follows one of the elementary cellular automata (ECA)
rules if its pores are open and either remains in state ‘0’ (ﬁrst species of fungal
automata) or its previous state (second species of fungal automata) if its pores are
closed. The Woronin bodies closing the pores are also governed by ECA rules. We
analyse a structure of the composition space of cell-state transition and pore-state
transitions rules, complexity of fungal automata with just few Woronin bodies, and
exemplify several important local events in the automaton dynamics.

Introduction
The fungal kingdom represents organisms colonising all ecological niches [1] where
they play a key role [2–5]. Fungi can consist of a single cell, can form enormous
underground networks [6] and can form microscopic fruit bodies or fruit bodies

weighting up to half a ton [7]. The underground mycelium network can be seen
as a distributed communication and information processing system linking together
trees, fungi and bacteria [8]. Mechanisms and dynamics of information processing in
mycelium networks form an unexplored ﬁeld with just a handful of papers published
related to space exploration by mycelium [9, 10], patterns of electrical activity of
fungi [11–13] and potential use of fungi as living electronic and computing devices
[14–16].
Filamentous fungi grow by means of hyphae that grow at their tip and that branch
sub-apically. Hyphae may be coenocytic or divided in compartments by septa. Fila-
mentous fungi in the phylum Ascomycota have porous septa that allow for cytoplas-
mic streaming [17, 18]. Woronin bodies plug the pores of these septa after hyphal
wounding to prevent excessive bleeding of cytoplasm [19–24]. In addition, they
plug septa of intact growing hyphae to maintain intra-and inter-hyphal heterogeneity
[25–28].
Woronin bodies can be located in different hyphal positions (Fig.1a). When ﬁrst
formed, Woronin bodies are generally localised to the apex [29–31]. Subsequently,
Woronin bodies are either transported to the cell cortex (Neurospora crassa, Sordaria
ﬁmicola) or to the septum (Aspergillus oryzae, Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus
fumigatus, Magnaporthe grisea, Fusarium oxysporum, Zymoseptoria tritici) index-
Aspergillus fumigatus ) where they are anchored with a leashin tether and largely
immobile until they are translocated to the septal pore due to cytoplasmic ﬂow or
ATP depletion [23, 24, 27, 29, 30, 32–35]. Woronin bodies that are not anchored
at the cellular cortex or the septum, are located in the cytoplasm and are highly
mobile (Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus nidulans, Zymoseptoria tritici) [27, 29,
31]. Septal pore occlusion can be induced by bulk cytoplasmic ﬂow [27] or develop-
mental [36] and environmental cues, like puncturing of the cell wall, high tempera-
ture, carbon and nitrogen starvation, high osmolarity and low pH. Interestingly, high
environmental pH reduces the proportion of occluded apical septal pores [28].
Aiming to lay a foundation of an emerging paradigm of fungal intelligence—
distributed sensing and information processing in living mycelium networks—we
decided to develop a formal model of mycelium and investigate a role of Woronin
bodies in potential information dynamics in the mycelium.

Fungal Automata M
A fungal automaton is a one-dimensional cellular automaton with binary cell states
and ternary, including central cell, cell neighbourhood, governed by two elementary
cellular automata (ECA) rules, namely the cell state transition rule f and the Woronin
bodiesadjustmentrule g:M = ⟨N, u, Q, f, g⟩.Eachcell xi hasauniqueindexi ∈N.
Its state is updated from Q = {0, 1} in discrete time depending of its current state xt
i ,
the states of its left xt
i−1 and right neighbours xt
i+1 and the state of cell x’s Woronin
body w. Woronin bodies take states from Q: wt = 1 means Woronin bodies (Fig.1)
in cell x blocks the pores and the cell has no communication with its neighbours, and

wt = 0 means that Woronin bodies in cell x do not block the pores. Woronin bodies
update their states g(·), wt+1 = g(u(x)t), depending on the state of neighbourhood
u(x)t. Cells x update their states by function f (·) if their Woronin bodies do not
block the pores (Fig.2).
Two species of fungal automata are considered M1, where each cell updates its
state as following:
xt+1 =

0
if wt = 1
f (u(x)t) otherwise
and M2 where each cell updates its state as following:
xt+1 =

xt
if wt = 1
f (u(x)t) otherwise
where wt = g(u(x)t).
State ‘1’ in the cells of array x symbolises metabolites, signals exchanged between
cells. Where pores in a cell are open the cell updates its state by ECA rule f :
{0, 1}3 →{0, 1}.
In automaton M1, when Woronin bodies block the pores in a cell, the cell does
not update its state and remains in the state ‘0’ and left and right neighbours of the
cells can not detect any ‘cargo’ in this cell. In automaton, M2, where Woronin bodies
block the pores in a cell, the cell does not update its state and remains in its current
state. In real living mycelium glucose and possibly other metabolites [26] can still

this fact in present abstract model.
Both species are biologically plausible and, thus, will be studied in parallel. The

If g(u(x)t) = 0 this means that pores are open, if g(u(x)t) = 1 Woronin bodies block
the pores. Examples of space-time conﬁgurations of both species of M are shown

Properties of Composition f ◦g
Predecessor sets
Let F = {h : {0, 1}3 →{0, 1}} be a set of all ECA functions. Then for any compo-
sition f ◦g, where f, g ∈F, can be converted to a single function h ∈F. For each
h ∈F we can construct a set P(h) = { f ◦g ∈F × F | f ◦g →h}. The sets P(h)
for each h ∈F are available online.1
A size of P(h) for each h is shown in Fig.3c. The functions with largest size of
P(h) are rule 0 in automaton M1 and rule 51 (only neighbourhood conﬁgurations
(010, 011, 110, 111 are mapped into 1) in M2.
Size σ of P(h) vs a number γ of functions h having set P(h) of size σ is shown
for automata M1 and M2 in Table 1a.
With regards to Wolfram classiﬁcation [37], sizes of P(h) for rules from Class III
vary from 9 to 729 in M1 (Table 1b). Rule 126 would be the most difﬁcult to obtain
in M1 by composition two ECA rules chosen at random, it has only 9 ‘predecessor’
f ◦g pairs. Rule 18 would be the easiest, for Class III rules, to be obtained, it has
729 predecessors, in both M1 (Table 1b) and M2 (Table 1d). In M1, one rule, rule
41, from the class IV has 243 f ◦g predecessors, and all other rules in that class
have 81 (Table 1c). From Class IV rule 54 has the largest number of predecessors in
M2, and thus can be considered as most common (Table 1d).
Diagonals
In automaton M1 for any f ∈F f ◦f = 0. Assume f : {0, 1}3 →1 then Woronin
bodies close the pores and, thus, second application of f produces state ‘0’. If f :
{0, 1}3 →0 then Woronin bodes does not close pores but yet second application of
the f produce state ‘0’.
For automaton M2 a structure of diagonal mapping f ◦f →h, where f, h ∈F
is shown in Table 2. The set of the diagonal outputs f ◦f consists of 16 rules: (0, 1, 2,
3), (16, 17, 18, 19), (32, 33, 34, 35), (48, 49, 40, 51). These set of rules can be reduced
to the following rule. Let C(xt) = [u(x)t = (111)] ∨[u(x)t = (111)] and B(xt) =
[u(x)t = (011)] ∨[u(x)t = (010)]. Then xt = 1 if C(x)t ∨C(x)t ∧B(xt).

Turing Complexity: Rule 110
To evaluate on how introduction of Woronin bodies could affect complexity of
automaton evolution, we undertook two series of experiments. In the ﬁrst series
we used fungal automaton where just one cell has a Woronin body (Fig.5). In the
second series we employed fungal automaton where regularly positioned cells (but
not all cells of the array) have Woronin bodies.
State transition functions g of Woronin bodies were varied across the whole dia-
pason but the state transition function f of a cell was Rule 110, ρ f = 110. We have
chosen Rule 110 because the rule is proven to be computationally universal [38, 39],
P-complete [40], the rules belong to Wolfram class IV renown for exhibiting com-
plex and non-trivial interactions between travelling localisation [41], rich families
of gliders can be produce in collisions with other gliders [42–44].
We wanted to check how an introduction of Woronin bodies affect dynamics
of most complex space-time developed of Rule 110 automaton. Thus, we evolved
the automata from all possible initial conﬁgurations of 8 cells placed near the end
of n = 1000 cells array of resting cells and allowing to evolve for 950 iterations.
Lempel–Ziv complexity (compressibility) LZ was evaluated via sizes of space-time
conﬁgurations saved as PNG ﬁles. This is sufﬁcient because the ‘deﬂation’ algorithm
used in PNG lossless compression [45–47] is a variation of the classical Lempel–Ziv
1977 algorithm [48]. Estimates of LZ complexity for each of 8-cell initial conﬁg-
urations are shown in Fig.4a. The initial conﬁgurations with highest estimated LZ

(253), see example of space-time dynamics in Fig.4b.
We assumed that a cell in the position n −100 has a Woronin body which can be
activated (Fig.5), i.e. start updating its state by rule f , after 100th iteration of the
automaton evolution. We then run 950 iteration of automaton evolution for each of
256 Woronin rules and estimated LZ complexity. In experiments with M1 we found
that 128 rules, with even decimal representations, do not affect space time dynamics
of evolution and 128 rules, with even decimal representations, reduce complexity of
the space-time conﬁguration. The key reasons for the complexity reduction (compare
Fig.4b and c) are cancellation of three gliders at c. 300th iteration and simpliﬁcation
of the behaviour of glider guns positioned at the tail of the propagating wave-front.
In experiments with M2 128 rules, with even decimal representations, do not change
the space-time conﬁguration of the author. Other 128 rules reduce complexity and
modify space-time conﬁguration by re-arranging the structures of glider guns and
establishing one oscillators at the site surrounding position of the cell with Woronin
body (Fig.4d).
In second series of experiments we regularly positioned cells with Woronin bod-
ies along the 1D array: every 50th cell has a Woronin body. Then we evolved fungal
automata M1 and M2 from exactly the same initial random conﬁguration with den-
sity of ‘1’ equal to 0.3. Space-time conﬁguration of the automaton without Woronin
bodies is shown in Fig.6a. Exemplar of space-time conﬁgurations of automata with
Woronin bodies are shown in Fig.6b–h. As seen in Fig.7 both species of fungal
automata show similar dynamics of complexity along the Woronin transition func-
tions ordered by their decimal values. The automaton M1 has average LZ complexity
82.2 (σ = 24.6) and the automaton M2 78.4 (σ = 22.1). Woronin rules g which gen-
erate most LZ complex space-time conﬁgurations are ρg = 133 in M)1 (Fig.6b) and
ρg = 193 in M)2 (Fig.6e). The space-time dynamics of the automaton is charac-
terised by a substantial number of gliders guns and gliders (Fig.6b). Functions being
in the middle of the descending hierarchy of LZ complexity produce space-time
conﬁgurations with declined number of travelling localisation and growing domains
of homogeneous states (Fig.6cg). Automata with Woronin functions at the bottom
of the complexity hierarchy quickly (i.e. after 200–300 iterations) evolve towards
stable, equilibrium states (Fig.6dh).

Local Events
Let us consider some local events happening in the fungal automata discussed in
Sect.4: every 50th cell of an array has a Woronin body.
Retaining gliders. A glider can be stopped and converted into a station localisation
by a cell with Woronin body. As exempliﬁed in Fig.8a, the localisation travelling left
was stopped from further propagation by a cell with Woronin body yet the localisation
did not annihilate but remained stationary.
Register memory. Different substrings of input string (initial conﬁguration) might
lead to different equilibrium conﬁgurations achieved in the domains of the array
separated by cells with Woronin bodies. When there is just two types of equilibrium
conﬁgurations they be seen as ‘bit up’ and ‘bit down’ and therefore such fungal
automaton can be used a memory register (Fig.8b).
Reﬂectors. In many cases cells with Woronin bodies induce local domains of station-
ary, sometimes time oscillations, inhomogeneities which might act as reﬂectors for
travelling localisations. An example is shown in Fig.8c where several localisations
are repeatedly bouncing between two cells with Woronin bodies.
Modiﬁers. Cells with Woronin bodies can act as modiﬁers of states of gliders
reﬂected from them and of outcomes of collision between travelling localizations.
In Fig.8d we can see how a travelling localisation is reﬂected from the vicinity of
Woronin bodies three times: every time the state of the localisation changes. On
the third reﬂection the localisation becomes stationary. In the fragment (Fig.8e) of
space-time conﬁguration of automaton with Woronin bodies governed by ρg = 201
of the fragment we can see how two localisations got into contact with each in the

vicinity of the Woronin body and an advanced structure is formed two breathing
stationary localisations act as mirror, and there are streams of travelling localisations
between them. A multi-step chain reaction can be observed in Fig.8f: there are two
stationary, breathing, localisations at the sites of the cells with Woronin bodies. A
glider is formed on the left stationary localisation. The glider travel to the right and
collide into right breather. In the result of the collision the breath undergoes structural
transitions, emits a glider travelling left and transforms itself into a pair of stationary
breathers. Meantime the newly born glider collided into left breather and changes its
state.

Discussion
As a ﬁrst step towards formalisation of fungal intelligence we introduced one-
dimensional fungal automata operated by two local transition function: one, g, gov-
erns states of Woronin bodies (pores are open or closed), another, f , governs cells
states: ‘0’ and ‘1’. We provided a detailed analysis of the magma ⟨f, g, ◦⟩, results of
which might be useful for future designs of computational and language recognition
structures with fungal automata. The magma as a whole does not satisfy any other
property but closure. Chances are high that there are subsets of the magma which
might satisfy conditions of other algebraic structures. A search for such subsets could
be one of the topics of further studies.
Another topic could be an implementation of computational circuits in fungal
automata. For certain combination of f and g we can ﬁnd quite sophisticated families
of stationary and travelling localisations and many outcomes of the collisions and
interactions between these localisations, an illustration is shown in Fig.9. Thus the
target could be, for example, to construct a n-binary full adder which is as compact
in space and time as possible.
The theoretical results reported show that by controlling just a few cells with
Woronin bodies it is possible to drastically change dynamics of the automaton array.
Third direction of future studies could be in implemented information processing
in a single hypha. In such a hypothetical experimental setup input strings will be
represented by arrays of illumination and outputs could be patterns of electrical
activity recorded from the mycelium hypha resting on an electrode array.

Exploring Dynamics of Fungal Cellular
Automata

Abstract Cells in a fungal hyphae are separated by internal walls (septa). The septa
have tiny pores that allow cytoplasm ﬂowing between cells. Cells can close their
septa blocking the ﬂow if they are injured, preventing ﬂuid loss from the rest of
ﬁlament. This action is achieved by special organelles called Woronin bodies. Using
the controllable pores as an inspiration we advance one and two-dimensional cellu-
lar automata into Elementary fungal cellular automata (EFCA) and Majority fungal
automata (MFA) by adding a concept of Woronin bodies to the cell state transition
rules. EFCA is a cellular automaton where the communications between neighbor-
ing cells can be blocked by the activation of the Woronin bodies (Wb), allowing
or blocking the ﬂow of information (represented by a cytoplasm and chemical ele-
ments it carries) between them. We explore a novel version of the fungal automata
where the evolution of the system is only affected by the activation of the Wb. We
explore two case studies: the Elementary Fungal Cellular Automata (EFCA), which
is a direct application of this variant for elementary cellular automata rules, and the
Majority Fungal Automata (MFA), which correspond to an application of the Wb to
two dimensional automaton with majority rule with Von Neumann neighborhood.
By studying the EFCA model, we analyze how the 256 elementary cellular automata
rules are affected by the activation of Wb in different modes, increasing the com-
plexity on applied rule in some cases. Also we explore how a consensus over MFA is
affected when the continuous ﬂow of information is interrupted due to the activation
of Woronin bodies.

Introduction
The fungi kingdom is one of the widest spread form of life on earth. Without them
our planet landscape would be totally different. Life on land has evolved with the par-
ticipation of fungi and would collapse without their continued activities [1]. Fungal
morphology is based on hyphae, which are long and branching ﬁlaments. Collec-
tively called mycelium, they form the vegetative body on fungi. Hyphae are formed
by one or more cells enclosed by a tubular cell wall. In Ascomycota, one of the
several divisions of the fungi, hyphae are divided into compartments by internal
cross-walls named septum, formed by centripetal growth of the cell wall and crossed
by a perforation through which cytoplasmic organelles can pass. An electron-dense
protein body called Woronin body (Wb), is present on either side of the septa, reg-
ulating the opening and closing of the septal pores which is used to reduce or cut
the ﬂow of cytoplasm and organelles between cells compartments when the hypha
is ruptured [2].
Fungal physiology and behaviour gave rise to a novel ﬁeld of fungal computing
and fungal electronics [3–5]. Whilst experimental laboratory prototyping of fungi-
based computing devices is underway it is imperative to establish a wider theoretical
background for fungal computing. This is why we drawn our attention to developing
formal models of fungal automata. First steps in these theoretical designs have been
done in [6–8]. We advance the ideas into the dynamical properties of a model based
on the elementary cellular automata (ECA). This is a classic model that describes a
vast variety of natural dynamical phenomena over the years. One of the aspect that
is most interesting of ECA model is that, even when it is based in a simple set of
local rules that can be quite straightforward, its global dynamical behavior can be
extremely complex. In fact, since the end of the 1970’s, the behavioural complexity
emerging from normative simplicity motivated a wide range of researcher to under-
stand and classify ECA rules according to their dynamic behavior and computational
capabilities [9, 10]. A ﬁrst well known example is Wolfram’s classiﬁcation which
considers different criteria to cluster rules in four groups according to their dynamical
behavior starting from random initial conditions [11]. A second way of grouping the
elementary rules is according to their equivalences up to simple transformations of
their local transitions, such as reﬂection, conjugation and the combination of both.
There are 88 elementary cellular automata that are non-equivalent up to these trans-
formations. A third important example of rule classiﬁcation is in the study of the
computational capabilities of a given rule [12–14]. For instance, rule 110 is capable
of representing universal Turing computation in its dynamics [15]. Within this frame-
work, different cellular automata models, inspired from fungi hyphae behavior have
been recently proposed. For instance, in [8] the one-dimensional fungal automaton
has been introduced. This model is based on the composition of two elementary cel-
lular automaton functions, one controlling the activation state of the Wb and the other
controlling the automaton evolution. In addition, in [6], the authors have extended
the concept to two dimensions implementing a fungal sandpile automata, and shown
the computational universality of this FCA.

Exploring Dynamics of Fungal Cellular Automata
343
We present novel variant of the one-dimensional fungal automaton model, called
elementary fungal cellular automata (EFCA). By numerical simulations of this
model, we exhaustively explore the impact of Wb activation on the dynamics of
88 non-equivalent ECA rules. In addition, based on the fungal sandpile automata,
we develop a two dimensional cellular automaton ruled by the well-known majority
rule cellular automaton with the Von-Neumann neighborhood. We focus on observ-
ing how different choices for the activation of Wb can produce different dynamical
behavior on both cases. We accomplish this task by proposing different metrics such
as the magnetization and Hamming distance in order to compare the original rules
with the ones in which the Wb are activated. Finally, for majority rule, we study
how the besides Wb activation, which temporally block information ﬂow the con-
sensus of the network is not affected for strict majority rule and the consensus skew
is accelerated in the skew majority rule.

Preliminaries
2.1
Elementary Fungal Cellular Automata
An elementary fungal cellular automaton (EFCA) is an elementary cellular automata
(ECA) where adjacent cells can cut the ﬂow of information1 between them by the
activation of Wb (see Fig. 1). This means that cells with activated Wb can’t see the
current state of their neighbors, which produces a miss information and ambiguity
in applying the ECA rules and updating the cells’ states.
FCA were ﬁrst proposed on [8], implemented as one-dimensional cellular
automata2 with cell binary state and governed by two ECA rules, one for the
cell state transition rule f (·) and other the activation of Wb g(·). In this manner,
they implemented two species of FCA on which the activation of Wb is given by
wt+1 = g

u (x)t
, where u(x)t represents the neighborhood of cell x at instant t and
the update of cell x for the ﬁrst specie, is given by Eq. 1 and for the second specie
by Eq. 2.

Our approach is different. First the Wb state is not governed by current cell state,
instead is externally controlled, having states Q = {0, 1}, representing deactivation
1 The rule according which the automaton changes his current state.
2 A ring of size N which update his current state according to a rule.

Fig. 1 Fungal cellular automata structure based on fungal hypha. At the top is the biological scheme
of the hypha. At the bottom is a one-dimensional FCA, where each cell has a Woronin body (Wb)
that can be activate/deactivated blocking or allowing to see the current state value of his neighbors
and activation respectively. Our formulation for the update of cell state is the follow-
ing: Each cell xi has a unique index i ∈{0, 1, . . . , n} in a ring of size n, with n ∈N,
and a Wb Wbi. If the Wb is activated, Q : Wbi = 1, there is no communication
between cell xi and cell xi+1. Special case is when i = n, due the implementation
is in a ring there will be no communication between xn and x0. Every cell xi has
two neighbors at distance 1, xi−1 to the left and xi+1 to the right. The function f (·)
is then applied to the triplet which leads to a traditional ECA. Considering four
cells (xi−1, xi, xi+1, xi+2) and the activation of Woronin body at position i, when
the rule f (xi−1, xi, xi+1) is applied we will not able to see the content of cell at
i + 1 position due to the Wb activation and therefore we will face an ambiguity of
information at the left of the Woronin body activation. Then, applying the rule to
the next triplet f (xi, xi+1, xi+2) will produce an ambiguity information to the right
of Wb activation. We can manage the information ambiguity in both sides of Wb
activation when f (xi−1, xi, 0) = f (xi−1, xi, 1) for rules at left of activated Wb and
f (0, xi+1, xi+2) = f (1, xi+1, xi+2) if not, we remain in actual state. The explained
behavior is equivalent to application of the rule at left side of Wb activation and
other, different, rule at the right side of Wb. The formalization of this behavior, that
describes the evolution of EFCA from instant t to instant t + 1 is given by Eq. 3, as
follow:

Majority Fungal Automata
A two dimensional cellular automaton is a torus in which the value of a cell x(i, j)
will be 1 or 0 depending on the value of a function F(·) whose apply over neighbors
of x(i, j). We use von Neumann neighborhood of range 1 which is deﬁned as follows:
V (i0, j0) = {(i, j) :| i −i0 | + | j −j0 |≤1}
(4)
The function F(·) determines the value of a cell based on his neighbors is the majority,
meaning that the value of cell x(i, j) will be (zero or one) the most frequent value
among neighborhood. In other words, the opinion of a subject will be the opinion
of majority. Two types of majority are possible depending on how we deal with ties
(equal number of zeros and ones among neighbors). We will refer to skew majority
when in presence of a tie we force the value of cell x(i, j) to one (or zero depending
on how the skew is deﬁned). We will use majority when in presence of the tie the cell
value will remain in his current state (no change of opinion). The study of this type
of totalistic function is useful to understand consensus achievable over a network.
In Majority fungal automaton (MFA) each cell x(i, j) has horizontal and verti-
cal Wbs Wb(i, j) which can be activated by analogy with Wb activated in EFCA.
The activation modiﬁes neighbors that cell x(i, j) can see (Fig. 2). Following the
implementation used in [6] we activated Wb groups by rows or columns. In this
way, each cell has a state Q : {0, 1} which is updated according to a global function
F(·). At each time step t we could open or close all horizontal or vertical Wb, thus
the MFA becomes a tuple M F A =
	
Z2, Q, V, F, w

, where V is the von Neumann
neighborhood, F a global function (majority in this case), w is a ﬁnite word on the
alphabet H,V (horizontal, vertical) denoting which Wb are activated at each iteration
of automata evolution.
To implement majority function over a von Neumann neighborhood we denoted
V(i, j) =

When the Wb is activated (vertical or horizontal) the neighbors of x(i, j) are reduced
at half, so we have two options that is a conservative approach—we take the majority
of this reduced set or we sustain the original threshold which is equivalent to skew to
the opposite value. When Wbs are activated the following functions are employed:

Simulation Description and Metrics
Several types of numerical experiments were carried on FCA and MFA to evaluate
the impact of Wba on the behavior of the dynamics related to each cellular automata
rule. We describe how the experiments were implemented and also the metrics we
used to study them.
3.1
EFCA Rules
First simulation EFCA were implemented on a ring of size 100, with a random
initial condition. Then the automata were evolving according to the speciﬁed rules

Exploring Dynamics of Fungal Cellular Automata
347
for 99 generations given a ﬁnal matrix of 100 × 100. Based on the complete review
of ECA rules classiﬁcation in [16], we only used the 88 non-equivalent rules of ECA
rule-space. Every cell is binary, so we call magnetization the number of cells whose
state is one. Initial EFCA state is randomly selected employing [1, 10, 30, 60] mag-
netizations. For every selected initial state ﬁve different Wb activation were explored,
plus a base case where none Wb is activated (this corresponds to a traditional ECA).
The modes in which Wbs were activated are following:
• 1Wb-on: Only the Wb between the last and ﬁrst element of the ring was activated
during 99 generations. The rule behaves in a constraint array instead of a ring.
• 4Wb-on: Four Wbs regularly placed every N/4 of ring length (N) and activated
during all generations.
• 4Wb-mod: The same four Wbs previously mentioned, but with cycles of activa-
tion/deactivation every 10 steps.
• 4Wb-c&r (cut and release): The same four Wbs activated by 20 ﬁrst steps and then
deactivated until the ﬁnal step.
• allWb-on: every cell with its Wbs is activated to see how rule acts in a single cell
in isolation.
In order to get insights into how the activation of Wb affects EFCA, we measure
the magnetization index m, deﬁned at t instant as:
mt =
n

i=0
xt
i
(5)
Also relative hamming distance δt between two consecutive generations is mea-
sured, deﬁned as:
δt = (Xt−1, Xt)
n
with t ≥1, n ∈N and
(Xt−1, Xt) = Xt−1 ⊕Xt
(6)
.
Exhaustive simulation with one Wb activated In order to get a more complete
dynamic comprehension of Wb effect over the rule dynamics, we run the follow-
ing numerical experiment. We implement EFCA rules on a ring of size 12 and for
every possible initial input state (this is 212 = 4096 conﬁgurations) we measure the
hamming distance and magnetization index between the original ECA rule (none
Wb activated) and the same rule with one Wb activated. This is done for ECA rules
[30, 32, 90, 110, 150]. Also for each conﬁguration we search for cycles and when
they are found the period and transient are measured. For every conﬁguration we
also build the evolution graph, which is a directed graph where nodes represent the
state conﬁguration and edges indicate the next generation state in the evolution. This
kind of graph let us visualize graphically the occurrence of cycles and ﬁxed points
when they exists.

348
C. S. Sepúlveda et al.
Simulating more cells with one Wb activated Mixing the two previous experiment
we use same four rules of the second trial, with Wb activation of the previous exper-
iment but in an increased ring size of 32. The initial state of the EFCA is randomly
selected from the 232 possible initial condition making a sample of 6500 different
initial conﬁguration. The same metrics than in previous experiment were calculated
adding the relative Hamming distance from initial to ﬁnal state and magnetization
variation, also from initial to ﬁnal state. These two new measures are deﬁned as
shown in Eqs. 7 and 8.

Majority Fungal Automata
MFA were implemented in a torus of size 100 × 100 and we let evolve during 99
generations as we did with EFCA. Evolution of the MFA was done using the global
function previously described over Von Neumann neighborhood. Our global function
was implemented to be invariant respect Woronin bodies activation, this mean that
when Wb were activated the function (e.g. majority) was applied to smaller Von
Neumann neighborhood, due to the activation restricting the number of neighbors
that is possible to see. Initial condition of the MFA is randomly chosen using different
magnetizations (number of cells whose state is one) up to a maximum of 9000, which
is 90% of the torus. In every step only one kind of Wbs (horizontal or vertical), all
of them, are activated. To describe the activation sequence of Wbs we use words on
the alphabet H, V . For example, if we close horizontal Wb at current step, and in the
next step we switch them by verticals this will be expressed as: HV , if we repeat this
sequence until the ﬁnal step an additional star (*) will be added, having a notation in
the form of (HV )∗. We do not study the behavior when only vertical or horizontal
Wbs are activated, due to this case being similar to a typical ECA with the following
rules:
• Strict Majority transform into ECA rule 232.
• Majority (skew) transform into ECA rule 250.
To investigate how the MFA dynamics is affected by behaviour of Wbs, we set up
ﬁve different modes of Wb activation deﬁned as follow:

Exploring Dynamics of Fungal Cellular Automata
349
• Modulation,switchingbetweenopenandcloseofHorizontalandVerticalWoronin
bodies at every step (HV )∗
• H2V2, an activation of Wb but every two steps (H HV V )∗
• H4V4, an activation of Wb but every four steps (H H H HV V V V )∗
• cut & release, an activation of Wb at every step (HV )20, but only for the ﬁrst 20
generations, then all the Wbs are open until the next generation.
• Rand, a random activation of Wb at every step (HV )20. This means that in each
step a vertical or horizontal Wb is activated with probability 0.5.
To quantify the possible change, we deﬁned the following inter and intra-mode
metrics:
• (intra) Relative Hamming distance, is the hamming distance between MFA self
initial and ﬁnal state divided by N 2, where N is the size of MFA (square matrix
N × N), this can be expressed as:
δintra = X F,w
t0
⊕X F,w
tn
N 2
(9)
where X is a square matrix of size m × m, F is the global activation function in
use, w represents the word that describe the activation sequence of Wb and the
step of evolution of the MFA goes from t0, t1, . . . , tn.
• (inter) Relative Hamming distance, is the hamming distance between ﬁnal state
of control MFA (without activation of Wb at any time) and the others MFA with
different Wb activation mode, both with the same initial state and global function.
This can be described as:
δinter = X F,w0
tn
⊕X F,wk
tn
N 2
(10)
where X is a square matrix of size m × m, F is one of the two global activation
functions, w0 = ∅which means none Wb activated, wk represent a mode in the
set w = {H1V 1, H2V 2, H4V 4, cut&rel}
• (intra) Magnetization index, quantiﬁes the variation in cells with one as value,
between MFA self initial and ﬁnal state. This can be write as:
mintra =
m

i=0
m

j=0
x F,w
t0
(i, j) −
m

i=0
m

j=0
x F,w

(i, j)
(11)
where x(i, j) is the element in position (i, j) of the square matrix X.
• (inter) Magnetization index, quantiﬁes the variation of cells with one as value
between ﬁnal state of control MFA (without activation of Wb at any time) and the
others MFA with different Wb activation mode, both with the same initial state
and global function, according to the following:

(12)
Our global functions are both majority. A natural question that arises from this fact
is how the consensus, meaning the agreement over the network, is affected by the
activation of Wb. With the aim of investigate this phenomena we deﬁne the consensus
index, which is the mean MFA state at a time t, but changing all zero values by −1.
The following equation describes this index:
Cid(xt) =

By using this index, we seek to capture two different type of phenomena: (a)
we measure the possible ﬂuctuation in consensus between two different timestamps
ti, t j, and (b) we study the average consensus reached or see how different Wb
activations could change the consensus of the network. This is specially interesting
in knowledge areas such as: social dynamics, networking and even blockchain, to
determine if consensus is affected by the temporal interruption on the communication
ﬂow for Wb activation or if we can accelerate.

EFCA Rules
Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA) rules were classiﬁed by Wolfram in [11] into
four classes depending on their behavior starting from uniform (class 1) and follow
by periodic, chaotic and complex (class 4). This classiﬁcation naturally leads to
the question in whether our approach induces changes in the class classiﬁcation.
To answer that question and to get a better representation of new system dynamics
induced by the Wb activation, we create a graph in which the nodes represent every
of the 255 ECA rules. In this graph, each rule represented by a node has an edge
towards its his left (in red color) and right (in green color) equivalent EFCA rule.
This graph is shown in Fig. 3 where rules [0, 51, 204, 255] are the only ones with
loops representing the strongly connected components of the graph. The rule 51 has
two incoming self-edges representing that no matter how many Wb are activated or
in which mode its left and right rules are not only the same but actually the same rule
51. On the other hand rule 204 (identity rule) has the biggest incoming degree (acts
as a sink), meaning that the majority of rules will have a path in the graph connecting

them to rule 204. In order to illustrate some of the observations that can be inferred
from the graph, consider the following example. An EFCA rule is deﬁned over a
ring of length N with only one Wb activated at position i and rule 110 is the update
function for the next state. In all the cells not affected by the Wb activation, the rule
110 will be applied normally, as if the original ECA rule. For the triplets of cells that
are affected by Wb in his rightmost bit, instead of applying rule 110, rule 204 will
be applied and, on the other hand, for the triplet affected in his leftmost bit by Wb,
rule 238 will be applied. A complete list in a table format of rule’s equivalence (left
and right) is given in Table 2.
We note from the previous results that rules 57 and 99 (which are equivalent
between them and belong to Wolfram’s class 2) are the only ones in which Wb
activation increases class complexity at the right and left rules, transforming it into
class 3 rules. The rest of rules are summarised in Table 1 (Table 2).
4.1.1
First Simulation
A total of 6336 simulations were run, covering all 255 ECA rules, Figs. 4, 5, 6 and 7
are samples of the this numerical experiment. In these ﬁgures it is possible to see how
the ﬁve modes in which we activated Wb affect the normal behavior of ECA rule for
the same initial state and we compare against control rule (without Wb activation).
In Fig. 4f, the previous parameters for rule 57 are shown. Observe that this latter
rule is one of those rule that increases a complexity with Wb activation. On the
other hand, the same can be seen in Fig. 4f. Figures 5f, 6f and 7f exemplify how the
activation of all Wb leads the dynamical behavior of rule 90 to a behavior similar
to rule 204 (the identity rule) which plays the role of a sink on the graph shown in
Fig. 3.
A more quantitative way to see the effects produced by Wb activation on the
dynamics of each ECA rule is shown in Figs. 8, 9, 10 and 11, where for each rule the
Hamming distance and the magnetization index are shown for a given initial state,
the same initial state as in Figs. 4, 5, 6 and 7.
4.1.2
Exhaustive Simulation Results
For all 4096 different initial state and for each rule selected ([30, 32, 90, 110, 150])
we ﬁnd cycles or ﬁxed point when they exist and calculate period and transient. An
example of the analysis is shown in In Fig. 12 where is possible to see the histogram
of periods and transient for rule 110 with and without Wb activated.
A detailed example of this process for a given input can be seen in Fig. 13. The
ﬁrst images show the EFCA evolution for a given initial state with and without
Wb activation, next the evolution graph is produced and ﬁnally a plot showing the
variation in relative Hamming distance and magnetization index. The result shows
that the activation of Wb induces changes in the behavior of automata, for example
rule 150 generates for almost 95% of the time cycles with period of 62 in comparison
with the scenarios where no Wbs were activated.

Simulation with More Cells and One Wb Activated
A total of 195,000 simulations were run, each of which resulted in the identiﬁcation of
cycles and ﬁxed points. Similar to the previous section, the results were summarized
in histograms, as shown in Fig. 14. The objective of this stage was to investigate how
changes in ring size affect the effects produced by different Wb activation types.
4.2
Majority Fungal Automata
A total of 12000 simulations with random initial magnetization state were run. Sam-
ple of some timestamps for both global rules and H2V2 activation mode are shown
in Figs. 15 and 16.
The general results are summarized in Figs. 17 and 18. This ﬁgures show the
individual metrics as a function of magnetization in initial state using skew-majority
and majority as global function, and different Wb activation sequence. It is possible

to observe in Fig. 17 the effect of Wb activation, transforming the dynamic of skew-
majority. In the case of strict majority only irrelevant changes are induced as shown
Fig. 18.
Using MFA ﬁnal state with global functions without Wb activation as a point of
comparison we get metrics to quantify the change between these reference points and
the activation of Woronin bodies in sequence previously deﬁned. Figures 19 and 20
are the plots representing this changes.
To get a better understanding of consensus dynamics due Woronin bodies activa-
tion, we plot the consensus achieved in the ﬁnal step of every simulation getting the
Figs. 21 and 22.

Discussion
The activation of Woronin bodies (Wb) in EFCA has direct impact in system dynam-
ics. This is shown for example in rule 32 where the Wbs activation didn’t change
transient of cycle, but instead changes his period. In rule 90 on a ring of size 32, the

Wb activation introduces cycles where previously ﬁxed points exist. Same changes
in dynamics happen on size 12 ring and in all rules implemented, and rules 57-99
increase complexity behavior due the activation of Woronin bodies were other group
decrease complexity, leading to more trivial behaviors.
In MFA at ﬁrst glance we have the intuition that Wb could change the consensus
dynamics, perhaps transforming a un-skew function as strict majority into skew one
or kind of behaviors. The data shows strict majority is not affected in a signiﬁcant
way by the Wbs activation, achieving same dynamics of the global function without
Wb activated. In the case of skew-majority the skew is augmented making that all

means that no mater what we do, in this network the negative alternative/opinion will
always win.

Computational Universality of Fungal
Sandpile Automata

Abstract Hyphae within the mycelia of the ascomycetous fungi are compartmen-
talised by septa. Each septum has a pore that allows for inter-compartmental and
inter-hyphal streaming of cytosol and even organelles. The compartments, how-
ever, have special organelles, Woronin bodies, that can plug the pores. When the
pores are blocked, no ﬂow of cytoplasm takes place. Inspired by the controllable
compartmentalisation within the mycelium of the ascomycetous fungi we designed
two-dimensional fungal automata. A fungal automaton is a cellular automaton where
communication between neighbouring cells can be blocked on demand. We demon-
strate computational universality of the fungal automata by implementing sandpile
cellular automata circuits there. We reduce the Monotone Circuit Value Problem to
the Fungal Automaton Prediction Problem. We construct families of wires, cross-
overs and gates to prove that the fungal automata are P-complete.

Introduction
Fungi are ubiquitous organisms that are present in all ecological niches. They can
grow as single cells but can also form mycelium networks covering up to 10km2 of
forest soil [1, 2]. Fungi can sense what humans sense and more, including tactile
stimulation [3, 4], pH [5], metals [6], chemicals [7], light [8] and gravity [9]. Fungi
exhibit a rich spectrum of electrical activity patterns [10–12], which can be tuned by
external stimulation. On studying electrical responses of fungi to stimulation [12]

we proposed design and experimental implementation of fungal computers [13].
Further numerical experiments demonstrated that it is possible to compute Boolean
functions with spikes of electrical activity propagating on mycelium networks [14].
At this early stage of developing a fungal computer architecture we need to establish
a strong formal background reﬂecting several alternative ways of computing with
fungi.
In [15] we introduced one-dimensional fungal automata, based on a composition
of two elementary cellular automaton functions. We studied the automata space-time
complexity and discovered a range of local events essential for a future computing
device on a single hypha. We aim to demonstrate a computational universality of
fungal automata. To do this we modify state transition rules of sand pile, or chip
ﬁring, automata [16–20] to allow a control for moving of sand grains, or chips,
between neighbouring cells. The local control of the interactions between cells is
inspired by a control of cytosol ﬂow control in fungal hyphae [21–25]. Then we used
developed tools of sand pile automata universality [26–31] to show that functionally
complete sets of Boolean gates can be realised in the fungal automata.

Two Dimensional Fungal Automata
Filamentous fungi of the phylum Ascomycota have porous septa that allow for cyto-
plasmic streaming throughout hyphae and the mycelium [21, 22]. The pores of dam-
aged hyphae will be plugged by a peroxisome-derived organelle to prevent bleeding
of cytoplasm into the environment [32–35]. These Woronin bodies can also plug
septa of intact hyphae [23, 36]. The septal pore occlusion in these hyphae can be
triggered by septal ageing and stress conditions [23, 25, 37].
A scheme of the mycelium with Woronin bodies is shown in Fig.1. An api-
cal compartment has one neighbouring sub-apical compartment, while a sub-apical
compartment has a neighbouring compartment at both ends. Because compartments
can also branch, they can have one or more additional neighbouring compartments.
Thus, the compartment with pores and Woronin bodies is a elementary unit of fun-
gal automata, Fig.1bcd. From these compartments one can assemble quasi-one-
dimensional, Fig.1e, and two-dimensional, Fig.1f, structures.
In this context, let us consider a cellular automaton in the two dimensional grid
Z2 with the von Neumann neighbourhood, with set of states Q and a global function
F. Each cell of the grid has four sides that could be open or closed. An open side
means that the information (the state) of both cells is shared. If not, when the side is
closed, both sites mutually ignore each other. When every side is open we have the
usual cellular automata model [38]. On the other hand, if sides are open or closed
in some random or periodical way we get for the same local functions different
dynamic behaviours. We consider only “uniform” ways to open-close the sides.
Actually at a given step to open every vertical side (every column of the grid) or
every horizontal side, rows of the array. So the fungal automata model becomes a
tuple F A = ⟨Z2, Q, V, F, w⟩, where V is the von Neumann neighbourhood, w is a

where Vv is the von Neumann neihborhood of the site v, x′
v is update of xv.
By adding the condition of open or close sides of the site proposed here, the rule
changes as follows:
xv ≥4 ⇒x′
v = xv −α
∀u ∈Vv such that the gate is open

u = xu + 1

When the rule is applied in parallel on every site, the new state at a site v is:

v = xv −α + β
where β is the number of chips which the site v receives from its open and ﬁring
neighbours.
If every side (columns and rows) is always open, then we have the usual chip
ﬁring automaton. When a word w of open or close sides is considered, for instance
w = H HV V , at each step we open (or close) the rows or columns of the grid
periodically

Computational Complexity Notions
In order to study the complexity of an automaton we can analyse a power of the
automaton to simulate Boolean functions, i.e., by selecting speciﬁc initial condi-
tions and sites as inputs and outputs to determine the different Boolean functions the
automaton may compute by its dynamics [41]. More Boolean functions are founded,
more complex is the automaton. A similar notion, related to some prediction prob-
lems, appears in the framework of the theory of computational complexity. Essen-
tially this is similar to trying to determine the computational time related to the size
of a problem, that a Turing machine take to solve it. In our context, let us consider
the following decision or prediction problem.
PRE: Consider the chip ﬁring fungal automaton F A = ⟨Z2, V, Q, F, w⟩, an initial
assignment of chips to every site , x(0) ∈QZ2, an integer number T > 0 of steps of
the automaton and a site v ∈Z2, such that xv(0) = 0. Question: Will xv(t) > 0 be
for some t ≤T ?
Of course one may give an answer by running the automaton at most T steps,
which can be done in a serial computer in polynomial time. But the question is a little
more tricky: could we answer faster than the serial algorithm, ideally, exponentially
faster in polylogarithmic time in a parallel computer with a polynomial number of
processor?

Computational Universality of Fungal Sandpile Automata
375
To answer the questions we consider two classes of decision problems, those
belonging to P, the class of problems solved by a polynomial algorithm, and the class
NC, being the problems solved in a parallel computer in O(logqn) steps (polyloga-
rithmic time). This is straightforward that NC ⊆P because any parallel algorithm
solved in polylogarithmic time can be simulated efﬁciently in a serial computer. But
the strict inclusion is a very hard open problem (like the well know P = N P).
An other notion from computational complexity related with the possibility that
the two classes melt is P-completeness. A problem is P-complete if it is in the class
P, (that is to say, there exist a polynomial algorithm to solve it) and every other
problem in P can be reduced, by a polynomial transformation, to it. Clearly, if one
of those P-complete problems is in NC, both classes collapsed in one. So, to prove
that a problem is P-complete gives us an idea of its complexity.
One well known P-complete problem is the Circuit Value Problem, i.e., the eval-
uation of a Boolean Circuit (Boolean function). Roughly because any polynomial
problem solved in a serial computer (a Turing machine) can be represented as a
Boolean circuit. On the other hand, Boolean circuits intuitively are essentially serial
because in order to compute a layer of functions it is necessary to compute previous
layers so in principle it is not clear how to determine the output of the circuit in
parallel. Further, when the circuit is monotonous, i.e., it admits only or and and
gates (no negations) it is also a P-complete problem. This is because negation can
be put in the input (the two bits of the variable 0 and 1) and for the gates which are
a negation, to use the De Morgan laws.
The complexity of the chip ﬁring automata was ﬁrst studied in [26, 39], where
it was proved that in arbitrary graphs (in particular, non-planar ones) the chip ﬁring
automata are Turing Universal. To prove this a universal set of Boolean circuits is built
by using speciﬁc automata conﬁgurations, so, also PRE is P-complete. In a similar
way, but in a d-dimensional grid, Zd, it was proved in [40] that for d ≥3 the problem
is P-complete and the complexity, until today, remains open for a two-dimensional
grid. In [30] it was proved that in a two-dimensional grid and the von Neumann and
Moore neighbourhood it is not possible to cross signals by constructing wires over
quiescent conﬁgurations. That can be done only for bigger neighbourhood, so, in
fact, over non planar graphs.

Computational Complexity of the Fungal Automata
We will study the computational complexity of the Fungal Sand Pile Automaton, by
proving that for the word w = H 4V 4 = H H H HV V V V , the Prediction Problem,
PRE, is P-complete. That is to say one can not determine an exponentially faster
algorithm to answer unless NC = P.
Prop 1 For the word H 4V 4 = H H H HV V V V the fungal chip ﬁring automaton is
P-complete.

376
E. Goles et al.
Proof Clearly the problem is in P. It sufﬁces to run the automaton at most T steps
and see if the site i changes, which is done in O(T 3): in fact we have to compute
the “cone” between site i, its neighbourhood at step T −1, T −2, and so on, until
the initial values in the site in an square (2T −1) × (2T −1). So the number of
sites is to consider is 12 + 32 + 52 + · · · + (2T −1)2 which is bounded by a cubic
polynomial, so one may compute the state of site i in T 3.
To establish the completeness, we will reduce the Monotone Circuit Value Prob-
lem to the Fungal Automaton Prediction Problem, PRE. That is to say, to establish
speciﬁc automaton conﬁgurations which simulates a wire, the and and the or gates,
as well as a cross-over. This last gadget is important to compute non-planar circuits
in the two dimensional grid.
In the constructions below every cell which is not in the diagram is understood
initially empty, without chips (xi = 0).
To construct the wire let us ﬁrst see what happen when V 4 is applied in the
particular structure showed in Fig.2a. The important issue is that the initial site with
4 chips, after the application of V 4, remains with 4 chips. Only the adjacent sites and
down change their number of chips. Then one applies H 4 to obtain Fig.2b which is
similar to the initial conﬁguration, shifted to the right Fig.2c.
To implement and gate Fig.3 and or gate Fig.4 we have to connect two wires
(this corresponds to a branching of mycelium). In the and gate two single chips
arrive to a central site with 2 chips, so to trigger ﬁring, threshold 3, the signal has
to arrive. With H the signal continues to the right, thus the output is 1. The or gate
functions similarly to and gate but the central site has 3 chips. There is an unwanted
signal coming back signal but the computation is made to the right.
The cross-over is demonstrated in Fig.5. Here we apply four V and H steps. In
Fig.5a we illustrate the crossing of a horizontal signal (by applying H 4). For the
vertical signal the dynamics is similar but V 4 is applied. Figure5b shows the case
when two signals arrive at the junction at the same time.

Other Words of Automaton Updates
For other shorter words, like the usual chip ﬁring (with sides always open) and the
words in the set B = {HV, H 2V 2, H 3V 3} we are able to construct wires, the or and
the and gates, but we are unable to built a cross-over. In such cases we can only
implement planar circuits with non-crossing wires.
Below we exhibit the different constructions for those words. It is important to
point out that the strategy we used to built the constructions has been by taking as
initial framework a quiescent conﬁguration, i.e. a ﬁxed point of the automaton. In
[30] it has been proved that with this strategy, for a two dimensional grid with the
von Neumann or Moore neighbourhoods it is impossible to cross information, i.e.
to built a cross-over. It seems that is also the case for the words in the set B. In this
sense one may say that our result is the best possible: no shortest word allows to
cross information, at least following the quiescent strategy.

Discussion
Using sandpile, or chip ﬁring, automata we proved that Fungal Automata are com-
putationally universal, i.e., by arranging positions of branching in mycelium it is
possible to calculate any Boolean function.
The structure of Fungal Automata presented can be relaxed by consider the site
ﬁring chips only when it has as many chips as open side. In present model, since
at each step there are only two sides can be open, the ﬁring threshold is 2. In this

Consider the N × N grid {0, 1, 2, ..., N −1} × {0, 1, 2, ..., N −1}. Another pos-
sibility to open-close sides could be the following: at even steps t = 0, 2, ..., open
the even rows and columns and at odd steps, t = 1, 3, 5, ... open the odd rows and
columns.
If we do that we simulate exactly the Margolus partitions (2 × 2 blocks) [42].
This give us another way to determine the universality and, in this case, reversibility
of this speciﬁc Fungal Automaton, because with this strategy one may simulate the

Computational Universality of Fungal Sandpile Automata

Margolus billiard [43]. Not only that, given any other block partition automaton, say
by p × p blocks there exist a way to open-close the sides which simulates it [44–47].
A signiﬁcance of the results presented for future implementations of fungal
automata with living fungal colonies in experimental laboratory conditions is the
following: in our previous research, see details in [14], we used FitzHugh-Nagumo
model to imitate propagation of excitation on the mycelium network of a single
colony of Aspergillus niger. Boolean values are encoded by spikes of extracellular
potential. We represented binary inputs by electrical impulses on a pair of selected
electrodes and we record responses of the colony from sixteen electrodes. We derived
sets of two-inputs-on-output logical gates implementable the fungal colony and anal-
yse distributions of the gates [14]. Indeed, there were combination of functionally
complete sets of gates, thus computing with travelling spikes is universal. However,
in [14], we made a range of assumptions about origins, mechanisms of propagation
and interactions of impulses of electrical activity. If the spikes of electrical potential
do not actually propagate along the mycelium the model might be incorrect. The
sandpile model presented in the chapter is more relaxed because does not any auto-
catalytic processes: avalanches can be physically simulated by applying constant
currents, chemical stimulation to mycelium network. This is because the avalanches
can be seen as movement of cytoplasm of products of fungal metabolism.
Whilstthinkingaboutpotentialexperimentalimplementationinitiatingavalanches
is just one part of the problem. Selective control of the Woronin bodies might bring
substantial challenges. As previous studies indicate the Woronin bodies can block the
pores due to cytoplasmic ﬂow [36] or mechanical stimulation of the cell wall, high
temperatures, carbon and nitrogen starvation, high osmolarity and low pH [48–50].
We are unaware of experimental studies on controlling Woronin bodies with light
but we believe this is not impossible.

Fungal Language and Cognition

Language of Fungi Derived from their
Electrical Spiking Activity
Andrew Adamatzky
Abstract Fungi exhibit oscillations of extracellular electrical potential recorded via
differential electrodes inserted into a substrate colonised by mycelium or directly into
sporocarps. We analysed electrical activity of ghost fungi (Omphalotus nidiformis),
Enoki fungi (Flammulina velutipes), split gill fungi (Schizophyllum commune) and
caterpillar fungi (Cordyceps militaris). The spiking characteristics are species spe-
ciﬁc: a spike duration varies from one to 21 h and an amplitude from 0.03 mV to
2.1mV. We found that spikes are often clustered into trains. Assuming that spikes
of electrical activity are used by fungi to communicate and process information
in mycelium networks, we group spikes into words and provide a linguistic and
information complexity analysis of the fungal spiking activity. We demonstrate that
distributions of fungal word lengths match that of human languages. We also con-
struct algorithmic and Liz-Zempel complexity hierarchies of fungal sentences and
show that species S. commune generate the most complex sentences.

Introduction
Spikes of electrical potential are typically considered to be key attributes of neurons
and neuronal spiking activity is interpreted as a language of a nervous system [1–3].
However, almost all creatures without nervous system produce spikes of electrical
potential—Protozoa [4–6], Hyrdoroza [7], slime moulds [8, 9] and plants [10–12].
Fungi also exhibit trains of action-potential like spikes, detectable by intra-and extra-
cellular recordings [13–15]. In experiments with recording of electrical potential of
oyster fungi Pleurotus djamor we discovered two types of spiking activity: high-
frequency (period 2.6 m) and low-freq (period 14 m) [15]. While studying other
species of fungus, Ganoderma resinaceum, we found that most common width of an
electrical potential spike is 5–8 m [16]. In both species of fungi we observed bursts

of spiking in the trains of the spike similar to that observed in central nervous system
[17, 18]. Whilst the similarly could be just phenomenological this indicates a pos-
sibility that mycelium networks transform information via interaction of spikes and
trains of spikes in manner homologous to neurons. First evidence has been obtained
that indeed fungi respond to mechanical, chemical and optical stimulation by chang-
ing pattern of its electrically activity and, in many cases, modifying characteristics
of their spike trains [19, 20]. There is also evidence of electrical current participation
in the interactions between mycelium and plant roots during formation of mycor-
rhiza [21]. In [22] we compared complexity measures of the fungal spiking train and
sample text in European languages and found that the ‘fungal language’ exceeds the
European languages in morphological complexity.
In our venture to decode the language of fungi we ﬁrst uncover if all species of
fungi exhibit similar characteristics of electrical spiking activity. Then we charac-
terise the proposed language of fungi by distributions of word length and complexity
of sentences.
There is an emerging body of studies on language of creature without a nervous
system and invertebrates. Biocommunication in ciliates [23] include intracellular sig-
nalling, chemotaxis as expression of communication, signals for vesicle trafﬁcking,
hormonal communication, pheromones. Plants communication processes are seen
as primarily sign-mediated interactions and not simply an exchange of information
[24, 25]. Evidences of different kinds of chemical ‘words’ in plants are discussed
in [26, 27]. Moreover, a modiﬁed conception of language of plants is considered to
be a pathway toward “the de-objectiﬁcation of plants and the recognition of their
subjectivity and inherent worth and dignity” [28]. A ﬁeld of the language of insects
has been developed by Karl von Frisch and resulted in his Nobel Prize for detection
and investigation of bee languages and dialects [29, 30]. An issue of the language of
ants, and how species hosted by ants can communicate the ants language, was ﬁrstly
promoted in 1971 [31]. In early 1980s analysis of the ants’ language using informa-
tion theory approaches has been proposed [32]. The approach largely succeeded in
analysis of ants’ cognitive capacities [33–36].

Experimental Laboratory Methods and Analysis
Four species of fungi have been used in experiments: Omphalotus nidiformis and
Flammulina velutipes, supplied by Mycelia NV, Belgium (www.mycelium.be),
Schizophyllum commune, collected near Chew Valley lake, Somerset, UK, Cordyceps
militaris, supplied by Kaizen Cordyceps, UK (www.kaizencordyceps.co.uk).
Electrical activity of the fungi was recorded using pairs of iridium-coated stainless
steel sub-dermal needle electrodes (Spes Medica S.r.l., Italy), with twisted cables
and ADC-24 (Pico Technology, UK) high-resolution data logger with a 24-bit A/D
converter, galvanic isolation and software-selectable sample rates all contribute to a
superior noise-free resolution. Each pair of electrodes reported a potential difference
between the electrodes. The pairs of electrodes were pierced into the substrates

Fig. 2 Example of spike detection. Temporal position of each spike is shown by red vertical line.
The minor shift of the vertical lines away from the summits is consistent all over the recording and
therefore does not affect the results of the analysis
colonised by fungi or, as in case of S. commune, in the sporocarps are shown in
Fig.1. Distance between electrodes was 1–2 cm. We recorded electrical activity
one sample per second. We recorded 8 electrode pairs simultaneously. During the
recording, the logger has been doing as many measurements as possible (typically
up to 600 per second) and saving the average value. The acquisition voltage range
was 78 mV. S. commune has been recorded for 1.5 days, other species for c. 5 days.
The experiments took place at temperature 21 ◦C, c. 80% humidity, darkness.
Spikes of electrical potential have been detected in a semi-automatic mode as
follows. For each sample measurement xi we calculated average value of its neigh-
bourhood as ai = (4 · w)−1 · 
i−2·w≤j≤i+2·w x j. The index i is considered a peak of
the local spike if |xi| −|ai| > δ. The list of spikes were further ﬁltered by removing
false spikes located at a distance d from a given spike. Parameters were species spe-
ciﬁc, for C. militaris and F. velutipes w = 200, δ = 0.1, d = 300; for S. commune
w = 100, δ = 0.005, d = 100; for O. nidiformis w = 50, δ = 0.003, d = 100. An
example of the spikes detected is shown in Fig.2. Over 80% of spikes have been
detected by such a technique.

Characterisation of the Electrical Spiking of Fungi
Examples of electrical activity recorded are shown in Fig.3. Intervals between the
spikes and amplitudes of spikes are characterised in Fig.4 and Table 1.
C. militaris shows the lowest average spiking frequency amongst the species
recorded (Figs.3 and 4a): average interval between spikes is nearly two hours. The
diversity of the frequencies recorded is highest amongst the species studied: standard
deviation is over ﬁve hours. The spikes detected in C. militaris and F. velutipes have

highest amplitudes: 0.2 mV and 0.3 mV, respectively. Variability of the amplitudes
in both species is high, standard deviation nearly 0.3.
Enoki fungi F. velutipes show a rich spectrum of diverse patterns of electrical
activity which combines low and high frequency oscillations (Fig.3b). Most com-
monly exhibited patterns are characterised by low frequency irregular oscillations:
average amplitude 0.3 mV (Fig.4d) and average interval between two spikes is just
over 1.5 hr (Fig.4c and Table 1). There are also bursts of spiking showing a transi-
tion from a low frequency spiking to high frequency and back, see recording in blue
in Fig.3b. There are 12 spikes in the train, average amplitude is 2.1 mV, σ = 0.1,
average duration of a spike is 64 min, σ = 1.7.
O. nidiformis also show low amplitude and low frequency electrical spiking activ-
ity with the variability of the characteristics highest amongst species recorded (Fig.3d
and Table 1). Average interval between the spikes is just over 1.5 hr with nearly 2.5
hr standard variation (Fig.4g). Average amplitude is 0.007 mV but the variability of
the amplitudes is very high: σ = 0.006 (Fig.4h).
S. commune electrical activity is remarkably diverse (Figs.3c and 4ef). Typically,
there are low amplitude spikes detected (Fig.4f), due to the reference electrodes in
each differential pair being inserted into the host wood. However, they are the fastest
spiking species, with an average interval between spikes is just above half-an-hour
(Fig.4e). We observed transitions between different types of spiking activity from
low amplitude and very low frequency spikes to high amplitude high frequency spikes
(Fig.5). A dynamic change in spikes frequency in the transition Fig.5 is shown in
Fig.5a. A closer look at the spiking discovers presence of two wave packets labelled
(p1, p2) and (p2, p3) in Fig.5a. One of the wave-packets is shown in Fig.5c, and the
key characteristics are shown in Fig.6.
In experiments with S. commune we observed synchronisation of the electrical
potential spikes recorded on the neighbouring fruit bodies. This is illustrated in
Fig.7. The dependencies between the spikes are shown by red (increase of potential
spike) and green (decrease of potential spike) lines in Fig.7a. Time intervals between
peaks of the spikes occurred on neighbouring fruit bodies are illustrated in Fig.7b.
Average interval between ﬁrst four spikes is 1425 s (σ = 393), next three spikes 870
s (σ = 113), and last four spikes 82 (σ = 73).

Towards Language of Fungi
Are the elaborate patterns of electrical activity used by fungi to communicate states
of the mycelium and its environment and to transmit and process information in the
mycelium networks? Is there a language of fungi? When interpreting fungal spiking
patternsasalanguage,hereweconsiderconsideranumberoflinguisticphenomenaas
have been successfully used to decode pictish symbols revealed as a written language
in [37]: (1) type of characters used to code, (2) size of the character lexicon, (3)
grammar, (4) syntax (word order), (5) standardised spelling. These phenomena, apart
from grammar and spelling, are analysed further.
To quantify types of characters used and a size of lexicon we convert the spikes
detected in experimental laboratory recordings to binary strings s, where index i is
the index of the sample taken at ith second of recording and si = 1 if there is a spike’s

code like forms, extracted from the electrical activity of C. militaris and F. velutipes
are shown in Fig.8.
To convert the binary sequences representing spikes into sentences of the spec-
ulative fungal language, we must split the strings into words. We assumed that if
a distance between consequent spikes is not more than θ the spikes belong to the
same word. To deﬁne θ we adopted analogies from English language. An average
vowel duration in English (albeit subject to cultural and dialect variations) is 300 ms,
minimum 70 ms and maximum 400 ms [41], with average post-word onset of c.
300 ms [42]. We explored two options of the separation the spike trains into words:

Distributions of fungal word lengths, measured in a number of spikes in θ-separated
trains of spikes are shown in Fig.9. The distributions follow predictive values
fexp = β · 0.73 · lc, where l is a length of a word, and a varies from 20 to 26, and
b varies from 0.6 to 0.8, similarly to frequencies of word lengths in English and
Swedish, Fig.10 and Table 2 [38]. As detailed in Table 2, average word length in
fungi, when spikes grouped with θ = a are the same range as average word lengths
of human languages. For example, average number of spikes in train of C. militaris
is 4.7 and average word length in English language is 4.8. Average word length of
S. commune is 4.4 and average word length in Greek language is 4.45.
To uncover syntax of the fungal language we should estimate what is most likely
order of the words in fungal sentences. We do this via characterisation of global

transitions are estimated from the sentences of the fungal language.
The state transition graphs of the fungal spiking machines are shown in Fig.11
for full dictionary case and in Fig.12 for the ﬁltered states sets when states over 9
are removed.
The probabilistic state transition graphs shown in Fig.11 are drawn using physical
model spring-based Kamada-Kawai algorithm [43]. Thus we can clearly see cores of
thestatespaceas clusters of closelypackedstates. Thecores act as attractivemeasures
in the probabilistic state space. The attractive measures are listed in Table 3. The
membership of the cores well matches distribution of spike trains lengths (Fig.9).
A leaf, or Garden-of-Eden, state is a state which has no predecessors. C. militaris
probabilistic fungal spiking machine has leaves ‘25’ and ‘37’ in case of in grouping
θ = a (Fig.11a) and ‘20’, ‘17’ and ‘37’ in case of in grouping θ = 2 · a (Fig.11e).
All other probabilistic fungal machines do not have leaves apart of S. commune which
has one leaf ‘11’ in case of in grouping θ = 2 · a (Fig.11g).

θ = a a–d and θ = 2 · a e–h. ae C. militaris, bf F. velutipes, cg S. commune, dh O. nidiformis
An absorbing state of a ﬁnite state machine is a state in which the machine remains
forever once it takes this state. All spiking fungal machines, derived in grouping
θ = a, have the only absorbing state ‘1’ (Fig.12a–d). They have no cycles in the
state space. There are between 8, F. velutipes (Fig.12c) and O. nidiformis (Fig.12g),
and 11 leaves, S. commune) (Fig.12e) in the global transition graphs. A maximal
length of a transient period, measured in a maximal number of transitions required
to reach the absorbing state from a leaf state varies from 3 (F. velutipes) to 11 (S.
commune).
State transition graphs get more complicated, as we evidence further, when group-
ingθ = 2 · a isused(Fig.12h).FungalspikingmachineO.nidiformis hasoneabsorb-
ing state, ‘1’ (Fig.12h). Fungal spiking machines S. commune (Fig.12g) and C.
militaris (Fig.12e) have two absorbing state each, ‘1’ and ‘2’ and ‘1’ and ‘8’, respec-
tively. The highest number of absorbing states is found in the state transition graph
of the F. velutipes spiking machine (Fig.12f). They are ‘1’, ‘6’ and ‘2’. A number
of leaves varies from 7, S. commune, to 9, O. nidiformis and C. militaris, to 12,F.
velutipes. Only O. nidiformis spiking machine has cycles in each state transition
graph (Fig.12h). The cycles are 1 ←→5 and 2 ←→3.

To study complexity of the fungal language algorithmic complexity [44], Shannon
entropy [45] and Liv-Zempel complexity [46, 47] of the fungal words (sequences
of spike trains lengths) are estimated using The Online Algorithmic Complexity
Calculator1 [44, 48–50] in Table 4. The complexity estimates help us to rule out
randomness of the electrical spiking events and to compare complexity of the fungal

language with that of human. Shannon entropy of the strings recorded is not shown to
be species speciﬁc, it is 2.3 for most species but 2.4 for C. militaris in case of θ = a
grouping and 2.5 for most species but 2.6 for O. nidiformis in case of θ = 2 · a. The
same can be said about second order entropy (Table 4). O. nidiformis shows highest
values of algorithmic complexity for both cases of spike trains separation (Table 4ab)
and ﬁltered sentences (where only words with up to 9 spikes are left) (Table 4c). In
other of decreasing algorithmic complexity we then have C. militaris, F. velutipes
and S. commune.
The hierarchy of algorithmic complexity changes when we normalise the com-
plexity values dividing them by the string lengths. For the case θ = a the hierarchy
of descending complexity will be S. commune (7.55), C. militaris (6.51), F. velutipes
(3.94), O. nidiformis (3.67) (Table 4a). Note that in this case a normalised algorith-
mic complexity of S. commune is nearly twice higher than that of O. nidiformis. For
the case θ = 2 · a S. commune still has the highest normalised algorithmic complex-
ity amongst the four species studied (Table 4b). Complexities of C. militaris and
F. velutipes are almost the same, and the complexity of O. nidiformis is the lowest.
When we consider ﬁltered sentences of fungal electrical activity, where words with
over 9 spikes are removed, we get nearly equal values of the algorithmic complexity,
ranging from 3.96 to 4.05 (Table 4c). LZ complexity hierarchy is the same for all
three cases—θ = a (Table 4a), θ = 2 · a (Table 4b) and ﬁltered sentences (Table
4c): S. commune, C. militaris, F. velutipes, O. nidiformis. To summarise, in most
conditions, S. commune is an uncontested champion in complexity of the sentences
generated followed by C. militaris.

Discussion
We recorded extracellular electrical activity of four species of fungi. We found evi-
dences of the spike trains propagating along the mycelium network. We speculated
that fungal electrical activity is a manifestation of the information communicated
between distant parts of the fungal colonies. We adopted a framework of informa-
tion encoding into spikes in neural system [51–54] and assumed that the information
in electrical communication of fungi are encoded into trains of spikes. We therefore
attempted to uncover key linguistic phenomena of the proposed fungal language. We
found that distributions of lengths of spike trains, measured in a number of spikes,
follow the distribution of word lengths in human languages. We found that size of
fungal lexicon can be up to 50 words, however the core lexicon of most frequently
used words does not exceed 15–20 words. Species S. commune and O. nidiformis
have largest lexicon while species C. militaris and F. velutipes have less extensive
one. Depending on the threshold of spikes grouping into words, average word length
varies from 3.3 (O. nidiformis) to 8.9 (C. militaris). A fungal word length averaged
over four species and two methods of spike grouping is 5.97 which is of the same
range as an average word length in some human languages, e.g. 4.8 in English and
6 in Russian.

To characterise a syntax of the fungal language we analysed state transition graphs
of the probabilistic fungal spiking machines. We found that attractive measures, or
communication cores, of the fungal machines are composed of the words up to ten
spikes long with longer words appearing less often.
We analysed complexity of the fungal language and found that species S. commune
generates most complex, amongst four species studied, sentences. The species C.
militaris is slightly below S. commune in the hierarchy of complexity and F. velutipes
and O. nidiformis occupy lower levels of the hierarchy. We found that Shannon
entropy poorly, if at all, discriminate between the species. That could due to sentences
in the fungal language posses the same amount of information about physiological
state of fungi and environment. LZ complexity, algorithmic complexity and logical
depth give us substantial differentiation between species. The algorithmic complexity
is most ‘species sensitive’ measure. This could be to the fact, while convey the same
amount of information, dialects of different species are different.
Future research should go in three directions: study of inter-species variations,
interpretation of a fungal grammar and re-consideration of the coding type. First, we
should increase a number of fungi species studied to uncover if there is a signiﬁ-
cant variations in the language syntax among the species. Second, we should try to
uncover grammatical constructions, if any in the fungal language, and to attempt to
semantically interpret syntax of the fungal sentences. Third, and probably the most
important direction of future research, would to be make a thorough and detailed
classiﬁcation of fungal words, derived from the train of spikes. Right now we clas-
siﬁed the word based solely on a number of spikes in the corresponding trains. This
is indeed quite a primitive classiﬁcation akin to interpreting binary words only by
sums of their bits and not exact conﬁgurations of 1s and 0s. That said we should not
expect quick results: we are yet to decipher language of cats and dogs despite living
with them for centuries and research into electrical communication of fungi is in its
pure infant stage. And last but not least, there may be alternative interpretations of
spiking electrical activity as a language. For example, one can adopt the technique of
signals integration over time trace, as has been in experiments with chemical Turing
machine [55]. Another option could be to characterise each peak by determining its
fuzzy entropy by the algorithm presented in [56].

Abstract Fungal organisms can perceive the outer world in a way similar to what
animals sense. Does that mean that they have full awareness of their environment and
themselves? Is a fungus a conscious entity? In laboratory experiments we found that
fungiproducepatternsofelectricalactivity,similartoneurons.Therearelowandhigh
frequency oscillations and convoys of spike trains. The neural-like electrical activity
is yet another manifestation of the fungal intelligence. We discuss fungal cognitive
capabilities and intelligence in evolutionary perspective, and question whether fungi
are conscious and what does fungal consciousness mean, considering their exhibiting
of complex behaviours, a wide spectrum of sensory abilities, learning, memory and
decision making. We overview experimental evidences of consciousness found in
fungi. Our conclusions allow us to give a positive answer to the important research
questions of fungal cognition, intelligence and forms of consciousness.

The Basic Nature of Fungi
Cognition and intelligence in nature is a topic of debate from multiple points of view.
While nowadays it is acceptable to speak about the cognition and intelligence within
the biological kingdom Animalia, and even up to certain degree in Plantæ[1, 2],
it is still controversial to discuss those capacities in other lifeforms such as Fungi,
Protista and Monera, the latest corresponding to single-celled organisms without
true nucleus (particularly bacteria) [3, 4]. However, the current move in research
towards basal cognition and intelligence shows how already unicellular organisms
possess basal levels of cognition and intelligent behaviour [5–11]. Further perplexity
arises when considering consciousness in living organisms. Humans are conscious,
and some allow consciousness in animals provided by a nervous systems. But other
living creatures are typically considered not having consciousness at all. Our focus is
on fungi, remarkable organisms with surprising cognitive capacities and behaviours
which can be characterised as intelligent, and this article will argue that they possess
a level of basal consciousness.
Fungi dominated the Earth 600 million years before the arrival of plants [12, 13].
Even today the largest known living organism in the world is a contiguous colony of
Armillaria ostoyae, found in the Oregon Malheur National Forest, and colloquially
known as the “Humongous fungus”. Its size is impressive: 910 hectares, possibly
weighing as much as 35,000 tons and having an estimated age of 8,650years [14].
Identiﬁcation of Armillaria species used two methods: diploid-diploid pairings, and
restriction fragment length polyporphisms (RFLPs) of the intergenic spacer I (IGS-I)
ribosomal DNA region. A total of 112 Armillaria isolates were collected over two
years campaigns, from six conifer species [15].
Furthermore, current estimations sum up a total of 3.8 million existing species
of fungi, out of which only 120.000 are currently identiﬁed [16], representing a
promising biotechnological tool-set from which human kind has slightly scratched
the surface.
Fungi have represented for humans ever since both an ally and a foe, in the ﬁrst
case serving to produce fermented food and beverages (just to cite the most impor-
tant one, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, fundamental for bread, beer and wine) and in
the second case, able to attack the same raw stocks and generate famine and dev-
astation (Puccinia graminis responsible for stem, black or cereal rust) [17]. They
have also shown particular features, including interaction with the nervous system of
parasitised superior organisms, to induce them performing actions which are instru-
mental to further fungi propagation. This is the case of Ophiocordyceps sinensis, also
known with its Tibetan name yartsa gumbu, an enthomopathogenic fungus parasitis-
ing ghost moths larvae, that is able to induce them standing vertically under the soil
surface, to facilitate spores spreading in spring times [18]. Similarly, Ophiocordyceps
unilateralis—a complex of species also known as “zombie ant fungus”—surrounds
muscle ﬁbres inside the ant’s body, and fungal cells form a network used to collec-
tively control the host behaviour, keeping the brain operative and guiding the ants to
the highest points of the forest canopy, the perfect place to sporulate [19].

By studying Fungi kingdom we can better hope to understand the origin of life
[20] and evolution of cognition, intelligence and consciousness as they gradually
emergefrombasalformsandup.But,beyondalltheextremelyimportantbiochemical
mechanisms that make them possible, a fundamental aspect in their organisation
emerges: consciousness.
2
Neuron-Like Spiking of Fungi
Spikes of electrical potential are an essential characteristic of neural activity [21–23].
Fungi exhibit trains of action-potential like spikes, detectable by intra-and extra-
cellular recordings [24–26]. In experiments with recording of electrical potential of
oyster fungi Pleurotus djamor (Fig.1a) we discovered a wide range of spiking activity
(Fig.1b). Two types were predominant high-frequency (period 2.6m) and low-freq
(period 14m) [26]. While studying other species of fungus, Ganoderma resinaceum,
we found that most common width of an electrical potential spike is 5–8 m [27]. In
both species of fungi we observed bursts of spiking in the trains of the spike similar
to that observed in central nervous system [28, 29]. Whilst the similarly could be
just phenomenological this indicates a possibility that mycelium networks transform
information via interaction of spikes and trains of spikes in manner homologous to
neurons. First evidence has been obtained that indeed fungi respond to mechanical,
chemical and optical stimulation by changing pattern of its electrically activity and,
in many cases, modifying characteristics of their spike trains [30, 31]. There is also
evidence of electrical current participation in the interactions between mycelium and
plant roots during formation of mycorrhiza [32]. In [33] we compared complexity
measures of the fungal spiking train and sample text in European languages and
found that the ‘fungal language’ exceeds the European languages in morphological
complexity. As per the speed of propagation of information by means of spike-like
structuresinthebioelectricsignal,wefoundaspikevelocityinslimemold(Physarum
policephalum) ca. 0.08 – 0.17mm/s [34], in Acetobacter aceti speed between 0.37
and 0.5mm/s [35], and we know that in superior animals a spike propagates with a
broad spectrum of speeds, ranging from the order of 1m/s up to 100m/s.
In [36] we recorded extracellular electrical activity of four species of fungi. We
speculated that fungal electrical activity is a manifestation of the information commu-
nicated between distant parts of the fungal colonies and the information is encoded
into trains of electrical potential spikes. We attempted to uncover key linguistic phe-
nomena of the proposed fungal language. We found that distributions of lengths
of spike trains, measured in a number of spikes, follow the distribution of word
lengths in human languages. The size of fungal lexicon can be up to 50 words, how-
ever the core lexicon of most frequently used words does not exceed 15–20 words.
Species Schizophyllum commune and Omphalotus nidiformis have largest lexicon
while species Cordyceps militaris and Flammulina velutipes have less extensive
one. Depending on the threshold of spikes grouping into words, average word length
varies from 3.3 (O. nidiformis) to 8.9 (C. militaris). A fungal word length averaged

General anaesthetics in mammals causes reduction of neural ﬂuctuation intensity,
shift of electrical activity to a lower frequency spectrum, depression of ﬁring rates,
which are also reﬂected in a decrease in the spectral entropy of the electroencephalo-
gram as the patient transits from the conscious to the unconscious state [37–40].
In words, a rich spiking activity is a manifestation of consciousness, and reduced
activity of unconsciousness.
In [41] we demonstrated that the electrical activity of the fungus Pleurotus ostrea-
tus is a reliable indicator of the fungi anaesthesia. When exposed to a chloroform
vapour the mycelium reduces frequency and amplitude of its spiking and, in most

the chloroform vapour is eliminated from the mycelium enclosure the mycelium elec-
trical activity restores to a level similar to that before anaesthesia.
To summarise, in experimental laboratory studies of electrical activity of fungi
we demonstrated that fungi produce neuron-like bursts of spikes which are affected
by general anaesthetics. These phenomena indicate that fungi can posses the same
degree of consciousness as creatures with central nervous system do.

Fungal Cognition
Once accepting the unity of such a big fungal biological structure as a single living
entity, we need to face a second challenge, that is, the anthropocentric bias [42] which
sees consciousness as an exclusively human capacity. This latter is the main cause for
the lack of interest in cognition and intelligence in minimal living systems. At this
very moment we can afﬁrm that intelligence is a property extended across all living
taxa, and that we can even talk about minimal consciousness, starting at microbial
level [5–11, 43]. The functional requests that make possible the existence of such
huge fungal colony are beyond the simple or automated addition of neighbouring
cells, but require a level of cooperation and informational communication that make
necessary to ask for a mechanism that makes possible all these processes, could it
be a form of consciousness? [44]. From a phylogenetic perspective fungi provide
the mechanisms for the existence of plant synapses [11], a fundamental aspect for
enabling plants complex information processing.
Our departure point is naturalistic and follows a simple idea: the biological expla-
nations which can be identiﬁed using a functionalist approach supervene on chemical
mechanisms; consequently, any approach to the emergence of informational minds
must rely on such embodied factors. On the other hand, social interactions modify

414
A. Adamatzky et al.
this process, forcing us to consider the emergence of mind as the coupling between
single individual units and collective behaviour.
Our approach to the study of fungal minds is not a panpsychist one (attributing
sentience to matter), but is based on an informational processing model in which we
identify the fungal self-awareness mechanisms which provide an empirical founda-
tion for the study of fungal minds. Two questions are orienting our study: are fungi
sentient? and...if so, could we talk about fungal collective consciousness?
From mycorrhizal relations, we know that fungi interact with plants roots and
allow the existence of mycorrhizal networks, used by plants to share or transport car-
bon, phosphorus, nitrogen, water, defence compounds, or allelochemicals. Thanks
to this network, plants regulate better their survival, growth, and defence strategies.
Such symbiotic relationship provides fungi carbohydrates, which are used metabol-
ically to generate energy or to expand their hyphal networks, generating therefore
the collective mycelium. And such mycelium can be considered the superstructure
from which the collective fungal consciousness emerges. As magisterially described
by Stamets [45] (page 4):
The mycelium is an exposed sentient membrane, aware and responsive to changes in its
environment. As hikers, deer, or insects walk across these sensitive ﬁlamentous nets, they
leave impressions, and mycelia sense and respond to these movements. A complex and
resourceful structure for sharing information, mycelium can adapt and evolve through the
ever-changing forces of nature... These sensitive mycelial membranes act as a collective
fungal consciousness.
From an evolutionary point of view, mycelia are a clear example of cooperation,
but also are used as a cheating mechanism in relation to host plants [46]. Cheating,
besides, decreases when high genetic relatedness exists, a key point for sustaining
multicellular cooperation in fungi [47]. We’ve considered possible cheating actions
of fungi towards their mycorrhizal hosts, but how can they form collective living
forms without cheating among themselves? The answer is related to the concept of
allorecognition. The ability to distinguish self from non-self is beneﬁcial not only for
self-preservation purposes [48] but also for protecting the body from external men-
aces, like somatic parasitism [49, 50]. We’ve seen how fungi are able to distinguish
between themselves and others, and how several mechanisms allow them to work in
colonies, to establish symbiotic or parasitic relationships with other living systems.
Their biochemistry allows them to adapt their actions to the informational variations
of the surrounding conditions, and requires a cognitive system able to adaptively
manage such actions.
4
Consciousness as Self-cognition
When observing cognitive and intelligent behaviour (adequate decision making,
learning, problem solving) of fungi we may ask whether some kind of consciousness
enables their goal-directed behaviour, where consciousness is the ability to make
sense of the present situation. One can search for the consciousness and its markers

Fungal Minds
415
starting with humans and investigate its evolutionary origins in other living organ-
isms. Comparing humans with simpler living organisms it might be useful to make
the distinction between primary and higher order consciousness. With minimal mod-
iﬁcations we can adapt the notion of “primary consciousness” in humans to describe
“primary consciousness“(that corresponds to “basal cognition“in other organisms
including fungi and even unicellular organisms.
Over the centuries, consciousness has been a puzzling phenomenon despite all the
efforts of the scientists who tried to unveil its mysteries. Plant cognition and intelli-
gence has been a matter of study for hundreds of years, and still there is an ongoing
controversy on its deﬁnition and functional extent [51]. There is a strong resis-
tance and reluctance to acknowledge intelligence and cognitive capacities (including
degree of consciousness) in other living beings.
Fungi can store information and recall it [52]. Fungal memories are procedural,
what is associated with anoetic consciousness. Fungi show self-nonself recognition
patterns. Fungi can navigate and solve mazes looking for a bait. Fungi perceive their
environment guiding themselves to sources of light or higher oxygen concentrations.
Self-nonself recognition, synchronous perception of light, nutrients, gravity, or gas,
moisture or other chemical gradients, only involves response to internal or external
stimuli, thus these cannot be quoted to support the afﬁrmation that fungi are conscious
or self-aware. Such behaviours can be also encoded in a computer, which will respond
accordingly to the instructed parameters.
Fungus has a role in the managing of such aneuronal consciousness, as has been
observed on tree colonies [53]. The fundamental part of our debate is to show that
living systems without nervous systems (which we usually regard as necessary for
self-awareness or intelligence) are able to perform tasks that we usually would ascribe
to conscious systems, and that consciousness is ubiquitous [54].
5
Biosensing for Data Integrating: The Mechanistic Path
to Fungi Consciousness
The ﬁrst aim of consciousness, from a pragmatic point of view is that of collecting
and combining information at some speciﬁc level of detail in order to take a decision
for action. Up to now the main focus on consciousness studies has been focused on
high level cognitive processes that follow a top-down hierarchical structure. Using
this model, fungi should be automatically discarded as suitable living systems which
could show consciousness. Instead of it our approach to the notion of consciousness
will follow a bottom up approach, from basic data to its ulterior processing and the
possible conscious decisions. We will present this case from a context situation:
Mycelium typically is just under the humus (the soil cover, i.e. a mix of leaves,
needles from pines, fallen branches etc.). Thus when we walk in the forest mycelium
“knows“by mechanical stimulation and stretch-activated receptors [55] that we are

416
A. Adamatzky et al.
walking there. This mechanoception process is shared by several living systems,
including plants [56].
Consider for example calcium signal transduction [57]: it has been proven that
in fungi this signalling pathway has an essential role in the survival of fungi [58],
as well as mediate stress responses, or promote virulence [59]. Mechanosensitive
channels can also be important for mating, as we see in Neurosopora Crassa [60].
The existence of such mechanosensitive receptors in fungi make possible to extend
some cognitive properties we have already clearly deﬁned in plants or mammals
to fungi. Consider for example the purinergic signalling [61]. Furthermore, sensing
capabilities so far described include also nutrient sensing (glucose, nitrogen) and
general chemophysical sensing (pH, temperature, light, gravity, electric ﬁeld) [55].
Are those mechanisms a sufﬁcient basis for the grounding of the following questions:
What does mycelium feel about this? Can the mycelium trace our movement? Can
the mycelium predict that we are approaching fruiting bodies (mushrooms)?
5.1
Integration Data in Fungi Systems
All cognitive systems display mechanisms for using captured information (an active
process, not just a passive one) and to decide output actions. Due to the multimodal
nature of data, this process implies an integration and meaning hierarchies. The
properties of fungi in data integration are shown in Table 1.
5.2
The Self: From the Genetic View to the Perceptual
and Processing Ones
It is necessary to say that the search for published scientiﬁc papers on the topics
about “fungal cognition” offers us zero results. The only connections between fungi
and cognition are related most of times to the cognitive impact for humans who are
in contact with fungi. But, of course, fungi do perform cognitive tasks, being self
perception one of the most important.The most basic notion of self identiﬁcation is
related to the delimitation of the structural elements that belong or not to one system.
In this sense, fungi have shown that their hyphae are able to discriminate self/non-self
and that use this skill to decide to fuse themselves with other genetically compatible
hyphae, thanks to anastomosis [91]. The mycelial networks of mycorrhizal fungi
can also recognise correctly the roots of their hosts from those of other surrounding
non-hosts. Even different mycorrhizas can coexist but never fuse together. There is a
second mechanism implied in self recognition that is omitted in most of current stud-
ies: alarmones [92]. These are regulatory molecules used to communicate exclusively
among single cells (not as host). Following [92], pages 13–14, we notice that a static
organism, like a ﬁlamentous fungi can live very long and move by hyphal growth,

Table 1 Different cognitive tasks performed by fungi
Fungal Abilities
Evidence
Decision-making and spatial recognition
Fungi use an elaborate growth and space-searching strategy
comprising two algorithmic subsets: long-range directional
memory of individual hyphae and inducement of branching by
physical obstruction [62]. The human pathogenic fungus
Candida albicans is able to reorient thigmotropically its
hyphae to ﬁnd entry points into hosts [63]
Short-term memory and learning
Fungi exposed to a milder temperature (priming) stress
perform better when exposed to a potentially damaging second
heat (triggering) stress. The priming state in ﬁlamentous fungi
dissipates over time: memory of the initial priming stress event
for a period of time of at least 24h [64]. Mycelium of
Phanerochaete velutina remembered the location in which a
bait was placed in a previous test, growing towards the same
direction in a new empty tray [52]. Saturating light stimulus
habituates Phycomyces sporangiophores to a light stimulus
but not to an avoidance stimulus [65]
Long-distance communication
Vacuole-mediated long-distance transporting systems support
mycelial foraging and long-distance communication in
saprophytes and mycorrhizal fungi [66, 67]
Photo-tropism
Fungi show a rich spectrum of responses to light. They sense
near-ultraviolet, blue, green, red and far-red light using up to
11 photoreceptors [68–71]
Gravi-tropism
Gravitropism, as well as thigmotropism, is the strongest
tropims of fungi. This tropism is well studied and
documented [72, 73]
Chemo-tropism and chemical sensitivity
Fungi are able to detect sources of nutrients and grow towards
them (foraging), in a similar fashion, a fungus would react
against a harmful chemical trace (e.g. toxic metals) by
growing towards the opposite direction [74, 75]. Fungal
colonies communicate through volatile compounds [76–78]
Sensing touch and weight
Thigmo-based responses, include thigmo differentiation,
thigmonasty, thigmotropism [31, 79–82]
Self versus non-self recognition
Fungi possesses incompatibility loci and a genetic difference
at any one of them is sufﬁcient to trigger destruction of the
mixed cell: in most fungal species, pairs of isolates taken at
random are generally incompatible [50]
Fighting behaviour
Several species of fungi are capable for capturing and
consuming nematodes [83, 84]. Antagonistic interactions
between wood decay basidiomycetes show combative
hierarchies with different species possessing different
combinations of attack and defence traits [85]
Trade behaviour
The nutrient exchange mutualism between arbuscular
mycorrhizal fungi (AMFs) and their host plants qualiﬁes as a
biological market [86–89]
Manipulating other organisms
Fungi evolved elaborate tactics, techniques and molecular
mechanisms to control other organisms, from attracting and
paralysing nematodes to programming insects behaviour and
death [18, 19, 90]

although it is physically constrained and must withstand the onslaught of all potential
genetic parasites they will encounter in their long life. The skill of self-identiﬁcation
and colonial identity is therefore fundamental for several purposes (such as mating
control). And some fungi even use retro-parasites for their own development.

Discussion
We presented experimental laboratory and philosophical studies of the fungal states
of mind. We considered several aspects of fungal cognition and provided arguments
supporting existence of fungal consciousness. We raised many more questions than
we provided answers. The new ﬁeld of fungal consciousness is opening in front of
us. Let us discuss directions of future studies. How could we make sure (in wording)
that the fungal behaviour is not mechanical (automatic) responses but that it holds
intention?Abstraction,creativity,judgement,arecharacteristicsofhumanconscious-
ness. Are fungi able of performing these? It might be useful to make the distinction
between “primary” and “higher order” consciousness.
Do fungi have holistic states of mind? Do they combine/modify such states? How
many fungal states of mind could be described? Do fungi create speciﬁc relational
contexts? Or are they, on the contrary, not capable of having holistic states of mind,
ajust following completely preﬁxed patterns? At which extent can we include fungi
affects into such cognitive processing? Fungal chemotaxis could be part of such
proto-emotional states.
A deeper consciousness state allows us to understand and accept sacriﬁcing our
“self“ for higher purposes (martyrs, heroes). Nevertheless we must recognise that
human individuals (and animals as well) are genetically different from each other,
with the only exception of twins, while the same could not apply to fungi. This in part
supports the observation that fungi sacriﬁce their bodies for the sake of their propa-
gation. Another thought is about mortality: though it is, particularly in the western
civilisation, uncommon for people to live everyday life with a constant thought of
being mortal, and pursue choices that quite often go in the opposite direction, as if
the individuals are immortal, it is unquestionably difﬁcult for humans to ﬁgure out
how the world would appear for immortal beings, like certain fungi. An immortal,
or even extremely old consciousness, would be able to develop perhaps an intel-
ligence out of reach for us, pursuing objectives that might seem unreasonable, for
our limited perception. Perception of space and time, causality, are all aspects that
we consider our unquestionable bottom line. But given the peculiarity of fungi mor-
phology and degree of connection, we may imagine how radically different compu-
tational schemes are embedded into a fungal consciousness. For example, rather than
3-dimensional visual perception, holographic perception might be possible, consid-
ering the quasi-ﬂat distribution of mycelia and its mechanoceptive reconstruction
of moving objects (animals) at the upper boundary layer. Non-causal consciousness
might arise from this speciﬁc perception framework, eventually hindering the time
perception. All of these remain open questions for further investigations.
