Abstract
The objective in extreme multi-label learning is to train a classiﬁer that can auto-
matically tag a novel data point with the most relevant subset of labels from an
extremely large label set. Embedding based approaches attempt to make training
and prediction tractable by assuming that the training label matrix is low-rank and
reducing the effective number of labels by projecting the high dimensional label
vectors onto a low dimensional linear subspace. Still, leading embedding ap-
proaches have been unable to deliver high prediction accuracies, or scale to large
problems as the low rank assumption is violated in most real world applications.
In this paper we develop the SLEEC classiﬁer to address both limitations. The
main technical contribution in SLEEC is a formulation for learning a small ensem-
ble of local distance preserving embeddings which can accurately predict infre-
quently occurring (tail) labels. This allows SLEEC to break free of the traditional
low-rank assumption and boost classiﬁcation accuracy by learning embeddings
which preserve pairwise distances between only the nearest label vectors.
We conducted extensive experiments on several real-world, as well as bench-
mark data sets and compared our method against state-of-the-art methods for ex-
treme multi-label classiﬁcation. Experiments reveal that SLEEC can make signif-
icantly more accurate predictions then the state-of-the-art methods including both
embedding-based (by as much as 35%) as well as tree-based (by as much as 6%)
methods. SLEEC can also scale efﬁciently to data sets with a million labels which
are beyond the pale of leading embedding methods.

Introduction
In this paper we develop SLEEC (Sparse Local Embeddings for Extreme Classiﬁcation), an extreme
multi-label classiﬁer that can make signiﬁcantly more accurate and faster predictions, as well as
scale to larger problems, as compared to state-of-the-art embedding based approaches.
eXtreme Multi-label Learning (XML) addresses the problem of learning a classiﬁer that can auto-
matically tag a data point with the most relevant subset of labels from a large label set. For instance,
there are more than a million labels (categories) on Wikipedia and one might wish to build a classi-
ﬁer that annotates a new article or web page with the subset of most relevant Wikipedia categories.
It should be emphasized that multi-label learning is distinct from multi-class classiﬁcation where the
aim is to predict a single mutually exclusive label.
Challenges: XML is a hard problem that involves learning with hundreds of thousands, or even mil-
lions, of labels, features and training points. Although, some of these problems can be ameliorated

using a label hierarchy, such hierarchies are unavailable in many applications [1, 2]. In this setting,
an obvious baseline is thus provided by the 1-vs-All technique which seeks to learn an an indepen-
dent classiﬁer per label. As expected, this technique is infeasible due to the prohibitive training and
prediction costs given the large number of labels.
Embedding-based approaches: A natural way of overcoming the above problem is to reduce the
effective number of labels. Embedding based approaches try to do so by projecting label vectors onto
a low dimensional space, based on an assumption that the label matrix is low-rank. More speciﬁcally,
given a set of n training points {(xi, yi)n
i=1} with d-dimensional feature vectors xi ∈Rd and L-
dimensional label vectors yi ∈{0, 1}L, state-of-the-art embedding approaches project the label
vectors onto a lower bL-dimensional linear subspace as zi = Uyi. Regressors are then trained to
predict zi as Vxi. Labels for a novel point x are predicted by post-processing y = U†Vx where U†
is a decompression matrix which lifts the embedded label vectors back to the original label space.
Embedding methods mainly differ in the choice of their compression and decompression techniques
such as compressed sensing [3], Bloom ﬁlters [4], SVD [5], landmark labels [6, 7], output codes [8],
etc. The state-of-the-art LEML algorithm [9] directly optimizes for U†, V using a regularized
least squares objective. Embedding approaches have many advantages including simplicity, ease of
implementation, strong theoretical foundations, the ability to handle label correlations, as well as
adapt to online and incremental scenarios. Consequently, embeddings have proved to be the most
popular approach for tackling XML problems [6, 7, 10, 4, 11, 3, 12, 9, 5, 13, 8, 14].
Embedding approaches also have limitations – they are slow at training and prediction even for small
embedding dimensions bL. For instance, on WikiLSHTC [15, 16], a Wikipedia based challenge data
set, LEML with bL = 500 takes ∼12 hours to train even with early termination whereas prediction
takes nearly 300 milliseconds per test point. In fact, for text applications with bd-sparse feature
vectors such as WikiLSHTC (where bd = 42 ≪bL = 500), LEML’s prediction time Ω(bL(bd + L))
can be an order of magnitude more than even 1-vs-All’s prediction time O(bdL).
More importantly, the critical assumption made by embedding methods, that the training label matrix
is low-rank, is violated in almost all real world applications. Figure 1(a) plots the approximation
error in the label matrix as bL is varied on the WikiLSHTC data set. As is clear, even with a 500-
dimensional subspace the label matrix still has 90% approximation error. This happens primarily
due to the presence of hundreds of thousands of “tail” labels (Figure 1(b)) which occur in at most 5
data points each and, hence, cannot be well approximated by any linear low dimensional basis.
The SLEEC approach: Our algorithm SLEEC extends embedding methods in multiple ways to ad-
dress these limitations. First, instead of globally projecting onto a linear low-rank subspace, SLEEC
learns embeddings zi which non-linearly capture label correlations by preserving the pairwise dis-
tances between only the closest (rather than all) label vectors, i.e. d(zi, zj) ≈d(yi, yj) only if
i ∈kNN(j) where d is a distance metric. Regressors V are trained to predict zi = Vxi. We pro-
pose a novel formulation for learning such embeddings that can be formally shown to consistently
preserve nearest neighbours in the label space. We build an efﬁcient pipeline for training these
embeddings which can be orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art embedding methods.
During prediction, rather than using a decompression matrix, SLEEC uses a k-nearest neighbour
(kNN) classiﬁer in the embedding space, thus leveraging the fact that nearest neighbours have been
preserved during training. Thus, for a novel point x, the predicted label vector is obtained using
y = P
i:Vxi∈kNN(Vx) yi. The use of a kNN classiﬁer is well motivated as kNN outperforms dis-
criminative methods in acutely low training data regimes [17] as is the case with tail labels.
The superiority of SLEEC’s proposed embeddings over traditional low-rank embeddings can be
seen by looking at Figure 1, which shows that the relative approximation error in learning SLEEC’s
embeddings is signiﬁcantly smaller as compared to the low-rank approximation error. Moreover, we
also ﬁnd that SLEEC can improve the prediction accuracy of state-of-the-art embedding methods
by as much as 35% (absolute) on the challenging WikiLSHTC data set. SLEEC also signiﬁcantly
outperforms methods such as WSABIE [13] which also use kNN classiﬁcation in the embedding
space but learn their embeddings using the traditional low-rank assumption.
Clustering based speedup: However, kNN classiﬁers are known to be slow at prediction. SLEEC
therefore clusters the training data into C clusters, learning a separate embedding per cluster and
performing kNN classiﬁcation within the test point’s cluster alone. This allows SLEEC to be more

than two orders of magnitude faster at prediction than LEML and other embedding methods on the
WikiLSHTC data. In fact, SLEEC also scales well to the Ads1M data set involving a million labels
which is beyond the pale of leading embedding methods. Moreover, the clustering trick does not
signiﬁcantly beneﬁt other state-of-the-art methods (see Figure 1(c), thus indicating that SLEEC’s
embeddings are key to its performance boost.
Since clustering can be unstable in large dimensions, SLEEC compensates by learning a small en-
semble where each individual learner is generated by a different random clustering. This was empir-
ically found to help tackle instabilities of clustering and signiﬁcantly boost prediction accuracy with
only linear increases in training and prediction time. For instance, on WikiLSHTC, SLEEC’s pre-
diction accuracy was 55% with an 8 millisecond prediction time whereas LEML could only manage
20% accuracy while taking 300 milliseconds for prediction per test point.
Tree-based approaches: Recently, tree based methods [1, 15, 2] have also become popular for
XML as they enjoy signiﬁcant accuracy gains over the existing embedding methods. For instance,
FastXML [15] can achieve a prediction accuracy of 49% on WikiLSHTC using a 50 tree ensemble.
However, using SLEEC, we are now able to extend embedding methods to outperform tree ensem-
bles, achieving 49.8% with 2 learners and 55% with 10. Thus, SLEEC obtains the best of both
worlds – achieving the highest prediction accuracies across all methods on even the most challeng-
ing data sets, as well as retaining all the beneﬁts of embeddings and eschewing the disadvantages of
large tree ensembles such as large model size and lack of theoretical understanding.

Method
Let D = {(x1, y1) . . . (xn, yn)} be the given training data set, xi ∈X ⊆Rd be the input feature
vector, yi ∈Y ⊆{0, 1}L be the corresponding label vector, and yij = 1 iff the j-th label is turned
on for xi. Let X = [x1, . . . , xn] be the data matrix and Y = [y1, . . . , yn] be the label matrix. Given
D, the goal is to learn a multi-label classiﬁer f : Rd →{0, 1}L that accurately predicts the label
vector for a given test point. Recall that in XML settings, L is very large and is of the same order as
n and d, ruling out several standard approaches such as 1-vs-All.
We now present our algorithm SLEEC which is designed primarily to scale efﬁciently for large L.
Our algorithm is an embedding-style algorithm, i.e., during training we map the label vectors yi to
bL-dimensional vectors zi ∈RbL and learn a set of regressors V ∈RbL×d s.t. zi ≈V xi, ∀i. During
the test phase, for an unseen point x, we ﬁrst compute its embedding V x and then perform kNN
over the set [V x1, V x2, . . . , V xn]. To scale our algorithm, we perform a clustering of all the training
points and apply the above mentioned procedures in each of the cluster separately. Below, we ﬁrst
discuss our method to compute the embeddings zis and the regressors V . Section 2.2 then discusses
our approach for scaling the method to large data sets.
2.1
Learning Embeddings
As mentioned earlier, our approach is motivated by the fact that a typical real-world data set tends
to have a large number of tail labels that ensure that the label matrix Y cannot be well-approximated
using a low-dimensional linear subspace (see Figure 1). However, Y can still be accurately modeled

using a low-dimensional non-linear manifold. That is, instead of preserving distances (or inner
products) of a given label vector to all the training points, we attempt to preserve the distance to
only a few nearest neighbors. That is, we wish to ﬁnd a bL-dimensional embedding matrix Z =
[z1, . . . , zn] ∈RbL×n which minimizes the following objective:
min
Z∈R b
L×n ∥PΩ(Y T Y ) −PΩ(ZT Z)∥2

where the index set Ωdenotes the set of neighbors that we wish to preserve, i.e., (i, j) ∈Ωiff
j ∈Ni. Ni denotes a set of nearest neighbors of i. We select Ni = arg maxS,|S|≤α·n
P
j∈S(yT
i yj),
which is the set of α · n points with the largest inner products with yi. |N| is always chosen large
enough so that distances (inner products) to a few far away points are also preserved while optimiz-
ing for our objective function. This prohibits non-neighboring points from entering the immediate
neighborhood of any given point. PΩ: Rn×n →Rn×n is deﬁned as:
(PΩ(Y T Y ))ij =
⟨yi, yj⟩,
if (i, j) ∈Ω,

otherwise.
(2)
Also, we add L1 regularization, ∥Z∥1 = P
i ∥zi∥1, to the objective function to obtain sparse embed-
dings. Sparse embeddings have three key advantages: a) they reduce prediction time, b) reduce the
size of the model, and c) avoid overﬁtting. Now, given the embeddings Z = [z1, . . . , zn] ∈RbL×n,
we wish to learn a multi-regression model to predict the embeddings Z using the input features.
That is, we require that Z ≈V X where V ∈RbL×d. Combining the two formulations and adding
an L2-regularization for V , we get:
min
V ∈R b
L×d ∥PΩ(Y T Y ) −PΩ(XT V T V X)∥2
F + λ∥V ∥2
F + µ∥V X∥1.
(3)
Note that the above problem formulation is somewhat similar to a few existing methods for non-
linear dimensionality reduction that also seek to preserve distances to a few near neighbors [18, 19].
However, in contrast to our approach, these methods do not have a direct out of sample generaliza-
tion, do not scale well to large-scale data sets, and lack rigorous generalization error bounds.
Optimization: We ﬁrst note that optimizing (3) is a signiﬁcant challenge as the objective function is
non-convex as well as non-differentiable. Furthermore, our goal is to perform optimization for data
4

sets where L, n, d ≫100, 000. To this end, we divide the optimization into two phases. We ﬁrst
learn embeddings Z = [z1, . . . , zn] and then learn regressors V in the second stage. That is, Z is
obtained by directly solving (1) but without the L1 penalty term:
min
Z,Z∈R b
L×n ∥PΩ(Y T Y ) −PΩ(ZT Z)∥2
F ≡
min
M⪰0,
rank(M)≤bL
∥PΩ(Y T Y ) −PΩ(M)∥2
F ,
(4)
where M = ZT Z. Next, V is obtained by solving the following problem:
min
V ∈R b
L×d ∥Z −V X∥2
F + λ∥V ∥2
F + µ∥V X∥1.
(5)
Note that the Z matrix obtained using (4) need not be sparse. However, we store and use V X as our
embeddings, so that sparsity is still maintained.
Optimizing (4): Note that even the simpliﬁed problem (4) is an instance of the popular low-rank
matrix completion problem and is known to be NP-hard in general. The main challenge arises
due to the non-convex rank constraint on M. However, using the Singular Value Projection (SVP)
method [20], a popular matrix completion method, we can guarantee convergence to a local minima.
SVP is a simple projected gradient descent method where the projection is onto the set of low-rank
matrices. That is, the t-th step update for SVP is given by:
Mt+1 = PbL(Mt + ηPΩ(Y T Y −Mt)),
(6)
where Mt is the t-th step iterate, η > 0 is the step-size, and PbL(M) is the projection of M onto
the set of rank-bL positive semi-deﬁnite deﬁnite (PSD) matrices. Note that while the set of rank-
bL PSD matrices is non-convex, we can still project onto this set efﬁciently using the eigenvalue
decomposition of M. That is, if M = UMΛMU T
M be the eigenvalue decomposition of M. Then,
PbL(M) = UM(1 : r) · ΛM(1 : r) · UM(1 : r)T ,
where r = min(bL, bL+
M) and bL+
M is the number of positive eigenvalues of M. ΛM(1 : r) denotes
the top-r eigenvalues of M and UM(1 : r) denotes the corresponding eigenvectors.
While the above update restricts the rank of all intermediate iterates Mt to be at most bL, computing
rank-bL eigenvalue decomposition can still be fairly expensive for large n. However, by using special
structure in the update (6), one can signiﬁcantly reduce eigenvalue decomposition’s computation
complexity as well. In general, the eigenvalue decomposition can be computed in time O(bLζ)
where ζ is the time complexity of computing a matrix-vector product. Now, for SVP update (6),
matrix has special structure of ˆ
M = Mt + ηPΩ(Y T Y −Mt). Hence ζ = O(nbL + n¯n) where
¯n = |Ω|/n2 is the average number of neighbors preserved by SLEEC. Hence, the per-iteration time
complexity reduces to O(nbL2 + nbL¯n) which is linear in n, assuming ¯n is nearly constant.
Optimizing (5): (5) contains an L1 term which makes the problem non-smooth. Moreover, as the L1
term involves both V and X, we cannot directly apply the standard prox-function based algorithms.
Instead, we use the ADMM method to optimize (5). See Sub-routine 4 for the updates and [21] for
a detailed derivation of the algorithm.
Generalization Error Analysis: Let P be a ﬁxed (but unknown) distribution over X × Y. Let each
training point (xi, yi) ∈D be sampled i.i.d. from P. Then, the goal of our non-linear embedding
method (3) is to learn an embedding matrix A = V T V that preserves nearest neighbors (in terms
of label distance/intersection) of any (x, y) ∼P. The above requirements can be formulated as the
following stochastic optimization problem:
min
A⪰0
rank(A)≤k
L(A) =
E
(x,y),(ex,ey)∼Pℓ(A; (x, y), (ex, ey)),
(7)
where the loss function ℓ(A; (x, y), (ex, ey)) = g(⟨ey, y⟩)(⟨ey, y⟩−exT Ax)2, and g(⟨ey, y⟩) =
I [⟨ey, y⟩≥τ], where I [·] is the indicator function. Hence, a loss is incurred only if y and ˜y have
a large inner product. For an appropriate selection of the neighborhood selection operator Ω, (3)
indeed minimizes a regularized empirical estimate of the loss function (7), i.e., it is a regularized
ERM w.r.t. (7).
5

We now show that the optimal solution bA to (3) indeed minimizes the loss (7) upto an additive
approximation error. The existing techniques for analyzing excess risk in stochastic optimization
require the empirical loss function to be decomposable over the training set, and as such do not
apply to (3) which contains loss-terms with two training points. Still, using techniques from the
AUC maximization literature [22], we can provide interesting excess risk bounds for Problem (7).

See Appendix A for a proof of the result. Note that the generalization error bound is independent
of both d and L, which is critical for extreme multi-label classiﬁcation problems with large d, L. In
fact, the error bound is only dependent on ¯L ≪L, which is the average number of positive labels
per data point. Moreover, our bound also provides a way to compute best regularization parameter
λ that minimizes the error bound. However, in practice, we set λ to be a ﬁxed constant.
Theorem 1 only preserves the population neighbors of a test point. Theorem 7, given in Appendix A,
extends Theorem 1 to ensure that the neighbors in the training set are also preserved. We would also
like to stress that our excess risk bound is universal and hence holds even if ˆA does not minimize
(3), i.e., L( ˆA) ≤L(A∗) + E-Risk(n) + (L( ˆA) −L(ˆ(A∗)), where E-Risk(n) is given in Theorem 1.
2.2
Scaling to Large-scale Data sets
For large-scale data sets, one might require the embedding dimension bL to be fairly large (say a few
hundreds) which might make computing the updates (6) infeasible. Hence, to scale to such large
data sets, SLEEC clusters the given datapoints into smaller local region. Several text-based data sets
indeed reveal that there exist small local regions in the feature-space where the number of points as
well as the number of labels is reasonably small. Hence, we can train our embedding method over
such local regions without signiﬁcantly sacriﬁcing overall accuracy.
We would like to stress that despite clustering datapoints in homogeneous regions, the label matrix of
any given cluster is still not close to low-rank. Hence, applying a state-of-the-art linear embedding
method, such as LEML, to each cluster is still signiﬁcantly less accurate when compared to our
method (see Figure 1). Naturally, one can cluster the data set into an extremely large number of
regions, so that eventually the label matrix is low-rank in each cluster. However, increasing the
number of clusters beyond a certain limit might decrease accuracy as the error incurred during the
cluster assignment phase itself might nullify the gain in accuracy due to better embeddings. Figure 1
illustrates this phenomenon where increasing the number of clusters beyond a certain limit in fact
decreases accuracy of LEML.
Algorithm 1 provides a pseudo-code of our training algorithm. We ﬁrst cluster the datapoints into
C partitions. Then, for each partition we learn a set of embeddings using Sub-routine 3 and then
compute the regression parameters V τ, 1 ≤τ ≤C using Sub-routine 4. For a given test point x,
we ﬁrst ﬁnd out the appropriate cluster τ. Then, we ﬁnd the embedding z = V τx. The label vector
is then predicted using k-NN in the embedding space. See Algorithm 2 for more details.
Owing to the curse-of-dimensionality, clustering turns out to be quite unstable for data sets with
large d and in many cases leads to some drop in prediction accuracy. To safeguard against such
instability, we use an ensemble of models generated using different sets of clusters. We use different
initialization points in our clustering procedure to obtain different sets of clusters. Our empirical
results demonstrate that using such ensembles leads to signiﬁcant increase in accuracy of SLEEC
(see Figure 2) and also leads to stable solutions with small variance (see Table 4).

Experiments
Experiments were carried out on some of the largest XML benchmark data sets demonstrating that
SLEEC could achieve signiﬁcantly higher prediction accuracies as compared to the state-of-the-art.
It is also demonstrated that SLEEC could be faster at training and prediction than leading embedding
techniques such as LEML.

curve. For WikiLSTHC, SLEEC with a single learner is more accurate than LocalLEML-Ensemble with even
15 learners. Similarly, SLEEC with 2 learners achieves more accuracy than FastXML with 50 learners.
Data sets: Experiments were carried out on multi-label data sets including Ads1M [15] (1M la-
bels), Amazon [23] (670K labels), WikiLSHTC (320K labels), DeliciousLarge [24] (200K labels)
and Wiki10 [25] (30K labels). All the data sets are publically available except Ads1M which is
proprietary and is included here to test the scaling capabilities of SLEEC.
Unfortunately, most of the existing embedding techniques do not scale to such large data sets. We
therefore also present comparisons on publically available small data sets such as BibTeX [26],
MediaMill [27], Delicious [28] and EURLex [29]. (Table 2 in the appendix lists their statistics).
Baseline algorithms: This paper’s primary focus is on comparing SLEEC to state-of-the-art meth-
ods which can scale to the large data sets such as embedding based LEML [9] and tree based
FastXML [15] and LPSR [2]. Na¨ıve Bayes was used as the base classiﬁer in LPSR as was done
in [15]. Techniques such as CS [3], CPLST [30], ML-CSSP [7], 1-vs-All [31] could only be trained
on the small data sets given standard resources. Comparisons between SLEEC and such techniques
are therefore presented in the supplementary material. The implementation for LEML and FastXML
was provided by the authors. We implemented the remaining algorithms and ensured that the pub-
lished results could be reproduced and were veriﬁed by the authors wherever possible.
Hyper-parameters: Most of SLEEC’s hyper-parameters were kept ﬁxed including the number of
clusters in a learner

, embedding dimension (100 for the small data sets and 50
for the large), number of learners in the ensemble (15), and the parameters used for optimizing (3).

SVP, were both set by limited validation on a validation set.
The hyper-parameters for all the other algorithms were set using ﬁne grained validation on each data
set so as to achieve the highest possible prediction accuracy for each method. In addition, all the
embedding methods were allowed a much larger embedding dimension (0.8L) than SLEEC (100)
to give them as much opportunity as possible to outperform SLEEC.
Evaluation Metrics: We evaluated algorithms using metrics that have been widely adopted for
XML and ranking tasks. Precision at k (P@k) is one such metric that counts the fraction of correct
predictions in the top k scoring labels in ˆy, and has been widely utilized [1, 3, 15, 13, 2, 9]. We
use the ranking measure nDCG@k as another evaluation metric. We refer the reader to the supple-
mentary material – Appendix B.1 and Tables 5 and 6 – for further descriptions of the metrics and
results.
Results on large data sets with more than 100K labels: Table 1a compares SLEEC’s prediction
accuracy, in terms of P@k (k= {1, 3, 5}), to all the leading methods that could be trained on ﬁve
such data sets. SLEEC could improve over the leading embedding method, LEML, by as much as
35% and 15% in terms of P@1 and P@5 on WikiLSHTC. Similarly, SLEEC outperformed LEML
by 27% and 22% in terms of P@1 and P@5 on the Amazon data set which also has many tail labels.
The gains on the other data sets are consistent, but smaller, as the tail label problem is not so acute.
SLEEC also outperforms the leading tree method, FastXML, by 6% in terms of both P@1 and P@5
on WikiLSHTC and Wiki10 respectively. This demonstrates the superiority of SLEEC’s overall
pipeline constructed using local distance preserving embeddings followed by kNN classiﬁcation.
SLEEC also has better scaling properties as compared to all other embedding methods. In particular,
apart from LEML, no other embedding approach could scale to the large data sets and, even LEML
could not scale to Ads1M with a million labels. In contrast, a single SLEEC learner could be learnt
on WikiLSHTC in 4 hours on a single core and already gave ∼20% improvement in P@1 over
LEML (see Figure 2 for the variation in accuracy vs SLEEC learners). In fact, SLEEC’s training

Table 1: Precision Accuracies (a) Large-scale data sets : Our proposed method SLEEC is as much as 35%
more accurate in terms of P@1 and 22% in terms of P@5 than LEML, a leading embedding method. Other
embedding based methods do not scale to the large-scale data sets; we compare against them on small-scale
data sets in Table 3. SLEEC is also 6% more accurate (w.r.t. P@1 and P@5) than FastXML, a state-of-the-
art tree method. ‘-’ indicates LEML could not be run with the standard resources. (b) Small-scale data sets
: SLEEC consistently outperforms state of the art approaches. WSABIE, which also uses kNN classiﬁer on
its embeddings is signiﬁcantly less accurate than SLEEC on all the data sets, showing the superiority of our
embedding learning algorithm.

time on WikiLSHTC was comparable to that of tree based FastXML. FastXML trains 50 trees in
7 hours on a single core to achieve a P@1 of 49.37% whereas SLEEC could achieve 49.98% by
training 2 learners in 8 hours. Similarly, SLEEC’s training time on Ads1M was 6 hours per learner
on a single core.
SLEEC’s predictions could also be up to 300 times faster than LEMLs. For instance, on Wik-
iLSHTC, SLEEC made predictions in 8 milliseconds per test point as compared to LEML’s 279.
SLEEC therefore brings the prediction time of embedding methods to be much closer to that of
tree based methods (FastXML took 0.5 milliseconds per test point on WikiLSHTC) and within the
acceptable limit of most real world applications.
Effect of clustering and multiple learners: As mentioned in the introduction, other embedding
methods could also be extended by clustering the data and then learning a local embedding in each
cluster. Ensembles could also be learnt from multiple such clusterings. We extend LEML in such
a fashion, and refer to it as LocalLEML, by using exactly the same 300 clusters per learner in the
ensemble as used in SLEEC for a fair comparison. As can be seen in Figure 2, SLEEC signiﬁcantly
outperforms LocalLEML with a single SLEEC learner being much more accurate than an ensemble
of even 10 LocalLEML learners. Figure 2 also demonstrates that SLEEC’s ensemble can be much
more accurate at prediction as compared to the tree based FastXML ensemble (the same plot is
also presented in the appendix depicting the variation in accuracy with model size in RAM rather
than the number of learners in the ensemble). The ﬁgure also demonstrates that very few SLEEC
learners need to be trained before accuracy starts saturating. Finally, Table 4 shows that the variance
in SLEEC s prediction accuracy (w.r.t. different cluster initializations) is very small, indicating that
the method is stable even though clustering in more than a million dimensions.
Results on small data sets: Table 3, in the appendix, compares the performance of SLEEC to sev-
eral popular methods including embeddings, trees, kNN and 1-vs-All SVMs. Even though the tail
label problem is not acute on these data sets, and SLEEC was restricted to a single learner, SLEEC’s
predictions could be signiﬁcantly more accurate than all the other methods (except on Delicious
where SLEEC was ranked second). For instance, SLEEC could outperform the closest competitor
on EurLex by 3% in terms of P1. Particularly noteworthy is the observation that SLEEC outper-
formed WSABIE [13], which performs kNN classiﬁcation on linear embeddings, by as much as
10% on multiple data sets. This demonstrates the superiority of SLEEC’s local distance preserving
embeddings over the traditional low-rank embeddings.
