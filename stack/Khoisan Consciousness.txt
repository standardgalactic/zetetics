Claiming Roots
Claiming roots is an arduous enterprise
not assigned to the faint of heart
its calling comes only to those who can
risk ridicule, scorn, quarantine
When I set out to look, to find the pieces
of myself, parts of my architecture buried
below the foundations, narratives excised, ancestral tongues
cut brutally from my mouth
When I followed the four winds, to search
for scattered histories, deliberately lost
purposefully distorted, inexplicably strayed
beyond the grasp, beyond my tactile reach
When I went into caves to discern the messages
of the grand-​great ones who went before
the diligent custodians of paradise
where the eland roamed and fynbos flourished
When I touched the earth of Robben Island
bathed in the streams of Hoerikwaggo
followed the shaman’s trail on !Gam //​Naka
or sat in the darkness of the torture room
yes, it was here, at the Castle of Good Hope
where they brought the treaties that would never be honoured
where decrees buttressed manifest destiny
[…]
It is this blood root, this perverted crucible
that consigned entire peoples to the boundaries
to the very edges of banishment, into a dangerous twilight
where strip-​mined, they were broken, divested of agency
Yet, the white man did not know

there’s a stubborn resistance in feigned surrender
there’s still currency in fragments
of tongues and the genetic block
No decree, no false deed of sale or transfer
can carry the memories, preserved for posterity
in blood-​bound masterpieces on the rocks
in one word, one salutation in a banished tongue
Seeking after roots, clamouring for banished pieces
of the me I was never allowed to be
of the heroes that were never heralded
of the chronicles buried under other stories
it is to this place that I came, risking the laughter
where I suffered, the indignity of imposed labels
where I was flung into the raging turbulence
of a people re-​birthing under pressure
[…]
Tomorrow our children will dance the riel
with sweet abandon, and sing in revived tongues
they will walk along the rivers and seas
and they will know, like sunrise, that they belong.

Foreword
It was only on my third reading of this most compelling, urgent, intriguing, and 
ultimately unsettling book by Rafael Verbuyst that I grasped the depth of this 
most exceptional, original contribution to the vibrant contemporary phenom­
enon that has come to be known as the resurgence of Khoi and San descen­
dants in Post-​apartheid South Africa.
In this refreshingly thorough and rigorous, and meticulously referenced 
work, through which Verbuyst interrogates the antecedents, the ideological, 
cultural, and sociological underpinnings, the methods and the motives of those 
driving this phenomenon, one is almost left standing on a piece of disturbed 
ground, a space where the remains of a crime scene have been excavated for a 
closer look at the body of evidence.
What sets this work apart is that it presents, in the classical emic view, a 
most cohesive insider’s view of the Khoi and San resurgence or, as Verbuyst 
puts it, the Khoisan revivalist movement, presenting the positions and per­
spectives of the progenitors, drivers, and active participants in this phenom­
enon, which, in less than three decades, has shifted both consciousness and 
actual policy in South Africa.
On a very personal level, I must record that it took quite some time before 
I actually acceded to what eventually became a marathon series of interviews 
with the author, even though I had observed him in attendance at numerous 
public events where critical issues were debated or where we were engaging 
in the process of cultural praxis through which the resurgence is given shape 
and form.
What struck me then, and what rings out clearly through the methodical 
presentation of the revivalist movement, is the sensitivity of the writer to the 
absolute agency of those identifying with this phenomenon to have their voice 
heard, to engage in the process of finding themselves, and identifying or asso­
ciating themselves with what they hold as their heritage.
It is this process of deconstructing an imposed identity and reconstructing 
a more appropriate identity, drawn from the strands of a rich history which, for 
all intents and purposes, had been lost, distorted, stolen, and strayed over cen­
turies of colonialism and, damningly, in the democratic era of South Africa’s 
history.
Verbuyst, through this methodically presented work has brought us face to 
face with a movement that no-​one believed would survive the marginalised 
space through which it had been relegated by those in power, by dismissive 
members of the academy, and by those who have vested interests, for whom

Foreword
this phenomenon presents the greatest threat because it challenges the sta­
tus quo.
What is furthermore most refreshing about Khoisan Consciousness is the 
authenticity of the voices of those who have been at the coalface of the pro­
cess of revivalism, from across the spectrum of the movement, whose perspec­
tives are presented in a dignified and respectful manner, not fetishized as has 
been the experience with so much other academic writing about indigenous 
movements.
Through this book, which needs to be widely read, we will connect the 
names of the critical interlocutors to events, follow the development of con­
sciousness of the descendants of the original inhabitants of Cape Town as they 
travelled from the first victorious freedom fighters, through dispossession, cul­
tural genocide, and, finally through a revivalist movement, risen to stake their 
claim to the ancient city where their ancestors were the custodians.

Preface
Right then and there I knew it was preface material. As I was browsing my 
social media feed on a lazy afternoon in early February 2019, I came across a 
dance performance, ‘coloured swans i: KhoiSwan’, that was taking place 
in two weeks’ time at the arts centre Vooruit, located a stone’s throw from my 
desk at Ghent University in Ghent, Belgium. The show was part of a two-​week 
festival, ‘Same Same But Different’, organized by Vooruit and partners. With a 
packed program of performances, the festival sought to reflect on the decolo­
nization debate in Belgium and beyond, with a focus on the role of the arts and 
African artists in particular. I booked my ticket in a flash, then read a bit more 
about the performance itself on Vooruit’s website:
In ‘coloured swans’, dancer, performer and choreographer Moya 
Michael wonders how the various different identities that are imposed 
on us might influence our body and how we move, speak and sing […] 
In ‘coloured swans i: KhoiSwan’ Michael teams up with visual-​ and 
performance artist Tracey Rose to explore their African roots and heri­
tage. They investigate where they stand today as women of colour and as 
descendants of the Khoi peoples of southern Africa.1
I am still wrapping my head around the stunning coincidence of encounter­
ing this performance that shared the theme of this book, not in South Africa 
but back at home in Belgium. Khoisan identity was permeating South African 
society at an exponential rate, but I never would have thought Khoisan reviv­
alism extended beyond its borders. At the time of the recital, I had just come 
back from fieldwork in South Africa, but I was teleported straight back to Cape 
Town as Michael moved across the stage through expressive dancing against a 
background of flashing images and eerie music. She embodied with verve the 
central theme of a woman struggling to find her way out of an identity crisis.
Like Michael, increasing numbers of South Africans are seeking meaning 
and comfort in Khoisan identity. For the past six years I have been trying to 
make sense of this phenomenon. Perhaps because it was so unexpected, both 
in terms of timing and location, attending KhoiSwan led me to reflect on the 
trajectory of Khoisan revivalism but even more so on my time in Cape Town.

Preface
I found myself in the most divergent of spaces and meeting the most fascinat­
ing range of people. I visited government buildings and universities. I attended 
book launches, protests, poetry recitals, and everything in-​between. Yet more 
than anything else, ‘Cape Town’ conjures up fond memories of the countless 
hours I spent with interlocutors in the city’s townships and suburbs, chatting 
about all things Khoisan over coffee or rooibos tea. The more I look back, the 
more I realize it is a privilege and a humbling experience to write about some­
thing so close to people’s hearts, yet so poorly understood in the society they are 
part of. It is primarily because of their generosity and trust that this book exists.
There are too many people to thank individually. I would, however, like to 
single out a few; many of whom I met in the name of research but now know as 
friends. I cannot begin to express my gratitude to two of the most committed 
Khoisan revivalists I came across: Chantal Revell and her husband Julian. You 
made sure a clueless Belgian somehow ended up meeting the right people and 
attending the relevant events. I could not have come as close to an understand­
ing of Khoisan identity had it not been for your continual guidance. I have 
never met a community activist as determined as Basil Coetzee. Spending 
time with you gave me an invaluable perspective on life in the Cape Flats. 
Rochey Walters: you combine a unique affection for Khoisan heritage with an 
unwavering entrepreneurial spirit; I appreciate you taking the time to share 
your insights with me. I thank the fiery Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras for explaining 
what drives her and countless other activists like her. To Mackie: thank you 
for our philosophical discussions about the meaning of Khoisan identity. I am 
thankful for the help I have received from Joseph Little and Aaron Messelaar; 
it is a privilege to have met people that are so driven. I salute Zenzile Khoisan 
and thank him for the many conversations. Your unrivalled passion and gifted 
mind have in large part made Khoisan revivalism what it is today. Finally, I am 
grateful to Desmond Sampson, who generously shared copies of Eland Nuus. 
I can think of no greater compliment than to have these people find value in 
the pages that follow.
As Khoisan revivalism expanded, so did my sense of analytical modesty. 
I could not properly and sufficiently include everyone who has made their 
mark on Khoisan revivalism. I trust that the reader will find this to be no act of 
deliberate omission. I undoubtedly left out important voices, failed to detect 
important cues, and misunderstood various issues. I take full responsibility for 
my choices and for any mistakes. I welcome any criticism of my work with 
great enthusiasm. In fact, as Khoisan revivalism grows more prominent, it 
will benefit from commentary from diverse perspectives. Such contributions 
are all the more important in light of the fact that, despite being subjected 
to decades of deconstruction in academia, ‘identity’ is firmly at the core of

various phenomena globally. Understanding the passion that drives ever 
greater numbers of people towards Khoisan identity is certainly the first step 
in any attempt to productively deal with their grievances. I have tried to pro­
vide such a critical understanding to the best of my abilities.
I could not have done so alone. I was a historian in training when I started 
my ma at Leiden University, but I graduated a fieldworker. I could not have 
wished for a better guide than Harry Wels. Your continuous support and 
encouragement bear witness not only to your fine qualities as a human being 
but also to your talents as an educator and academic. Generous grants and 
scholarships from vlir-​uos, fwo and the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy at 
Ghent University made it possible for me to carry out the PhD research on 
which this book is based (Verbuyst 2021). Here I was blessed once again with 
great supervisors and wonderful colleagues, all of whom gave me tremen­
dously useful feedback. To my supervisor, Berber Bevernage: your confidence 
in my academic potential means a great deal. Your razor-​sharp comments and 
eye for detail improved my text drastically. I thank Hanne Cottyn for her co-​
supervision and unwavering support, despite changing institutional homes. 
More than anyone else, you reminded me that my case is embedded in a global 
context. I also thank Felicitas Becker and Michael Meeuwis for carefully going 
through my text and providing invaluable input.
This project would not have been possible without my other co-​supervi­
sor, William Ellis. Your ability to think and make others think outside of the 
box is unparalleled. Our many conversations resonate throughout this text. 
Alongside many others, you have also made me feel at home at the University 
of the Western Cape (uwc). I thank Annelies Verdoolaege and Umesh Bawa 
in particular for making the joint PhD with uwc a reality. Doing this PhD in 
collaboration with uwc reflects more than a partnership between institutions. 
To me, it symbolizes a recognition of the link between uwc and Khoisan reviv­
alism. Henry Bredekamp, the ‘father of Khoisan revivalism’, was a historian at 
uwc for decades. I had the honour of interviewing Prof. Bredekamp several 
times, which resulted in a veritable treasure trove of information. While she 
has left uwc for some time, Yvette Abrahams, in her own right ‘the mother 
of Khoisan revivalism’, continues to enrich the debate on Khoisan issues tre­
mendously. There are not that many of us who study Khoisan revivalism in an 
academic setting. I therefore appreciate the thought-​provoking conversations 
I have enjoyed over the years with colleagues with whom I share this inter­
est: Siv Øvernes at the University of Tromsø, Itunu Bodunrin at the Univeristy 
of Johannesburg, and June Bam-​Hutchison at the University of Cape Town.
Last, but certainly not least, I thank Francesca Pugliese for travelling this 
road alongside me and my family for their continuous support.

Introduction
Everything we do is about our history. Although our ancestors were 
treated badly, we can still make a difference.

‘Just like our ancestors’, Chantal Revell remarked.2 Braai: sitting around a 
crackling fire, munching on meat. A quintessentially South African experience 
and a fitting conclusion to my fieldwork in Cape Town. Aside from the deli­
cious boerewors and homemade chakalaka, I recall the wonderful company 
of interlocutors-​turned-​friends that evening towards the end of August 2019. 
As we sat comfortably on lawn chairs, we reflected on all things ‘Khoisan’ and 
looked back on my time in South Africa. Over the course of several years, I had 
nagged pretty much everyone present with questions about Khoisan iden­
tity. For one last time before I flew back home to Belgium, they indulged me 
with their thoughts. Richard Burns joked that he was not accepted as Khoisan 
because of his fair skin. Rochey Walters teasingly confirmed that he was ‘pass­
ing for White’ and could not claim to be a ‘true’ Khoisan like him. Revell and 
the others chuckled. In contrast to ‘his privileged friend’, Walters reasoned 
that he had earned his credentials after being bullied as a child for ‘looking 
like a Boesman [Bushman]’. Then again, ‘coloureds do not exist’, he added in 
reference to the official classification of everyone present, except myself, as 
‘Coloured’. Indeed, ‘this name was given to us by your people’, Walters quipped, 
while turning towards me and taking my Belgian nationality as proof of 
complicity.
These jokes tackled stereotypes and taboos about race and ethnicity within 
the confines of the braai; a de facto South African safe space. On other occa­
sions or among different individuals, terms such as Coloured, Boesman, or even

Introduction
Khoisan might cause offense.3 Before recounting what further transpired at 
the braai, I therefore need to explicate some of the ambiguous legacies of colo­
nialism and apartheid that are embodied in contemporary forms of ethnic and 
racial identification –​ a topic I will revisit many times. As I explain in greater 
detail in Chapter 2, under apartheid (1948–​1994), those labelled ‘Coloured’ 
(i.e. Khoisan, enslaved people from Asia and other parts of Africa, as well as 
so-​called mixed-​race descendants of unions between Africans, Asians, and 
Europeans) received (marginally) greater societal benefits in certain respects 
than those classified ‘Black’ (i.e. the Bantu-​speaking majority) but fewer than 
‘Indians’ (i.e. descendants of migrants from the Indian subcontinent who 
arrived in the 20th century) and far less than those designated ‘White’ (i.e. 
descendants of European settlers and migrants). The more arbitrary interpre­
tations of skin tone and descent branded someone ‘African’, the lower their 
place on the hierarchy, causing the African majority to occupy the lowest rung 
in the socioeconomic and political pecking order. Among many other facets 
of life, ‘race’ determined where one could live, which professions they could 
practice, and who they could have intimate relations with. These policies were 
discontinued with the end of apartheid in 1994, but their legacies remain glar­
ingly visible. Moving about in Cape Town, where stunning beaches and luxuri­
ous wine estates are often a stone’s throw from overcrowded townships lacking 
basic infrastructure, one quickly realizes why South Africa competes for the 
highest rate of economic inequality in the world (Chatterjee 2019). Despite 
some improvements, disparities between rich and poor in various domains of 
life continue to correlate with one’s racial identity (Knight 2014, 24; Francis 
and Webster 2019). Race is no longer registered at birth, but the post-​apart­
heid census differentiates between ‘Black African’, ‘Coloured’, ‘Indian or Asian’, 
and ‘Other’, although one is free to identify with any ‘population group’ of 
their choosing (Statistics South Africa 2012, 31). At the same time, the 2003 
Broad-​Based Black Economic Empowerment Act –​ an affirmative action pol­
icy aimed at dismantling the privileges associated with one’s previous place 
on the apartheid racial hierarchy –​ stipulates that ‘Black people is a generic 
term which means Africans, Coloured and Indians’ (see Chapter 5). For these 
reasons and many more, racial labels still resonate with people’s experiences, 
	3	 As I explain in Chapter 2, the term ‘Khoisan’ was coined by the physical anthropologist 
Leonhard Schultze in 1928 to emphasize the similarities between what are by many still con­
sidered to be two distinct groups: the Khoi/​Khoikhoi (also spelled Khoe/​Khoekhoe) and the 
San (see below).

and code everyday conversations and encounters like those at the braai (Posel 
2001, 89, 109).4
Racial labels also remain contested, however. Indeed, those at the braai 
dismissed their official classification as Coloured and identified as ‘Khoisan’ 
instead: an ethnic identifier that also requires some explanation off the bat. 
While ‘Khoisan’ was the most common way interlocutors identified and there­
fore my default option (cf. Le Fleur and Jansen 2013, 1; Van Wyk 2014, 18; Brown 
and Deumert 2017, 572; Ives 2017, 10; Øvernes 2019, 47), others preferred instead 
(or interchangeably) to identify as ‘Khoi’, ‘Khoikhoi’, or a wide range of alterna­
tive terms such as Boesman. To minimize the risk of causing offence, I use inter­
locutors’ preferences, including their spelling (Barnard 2007, 1–​10). Khoisan is 
an umbrella term that refers to various population (sub)groups who are indige­
nous to Southern Africa, and share numerous linguistic and cultural traits. It is 
common to differentiate between the ‘Korana’, ‘San’, ‘Griqua’, ‘Nama’, and ‘Cape 
Khoi’ (Barnard 1992, 3).5 In Chapter 2, I explain why a great deal is contested 
about the term ‘Khoisan’, not least its relation to specific population groups, 
past and present. Suffice it to say that most of the people I interacted with used 
it, or any of the alternatives, to identify as the indigenous people of the Cape, 
who confronted an expanding European settler population from the mid-​17th 
century onward.6 The decimation, dispossession, and assimilation that ensued 
over the course of several centuries gave rise to the widespread notion that the 
Khoisan ceased being a distinct collective, particularly in urban settings. The 
Khoisan’s classification as Coloured alongside other groups was arguably most 
devastating, as it was accompanied by a violent suppression of Khoisan culture 
and identity. Not surprisingly then, the label Coloured is habitually rejected 
by people who are emphasising their Khoisan ancestry (as well as by various 
others; see Chapter 2).
Coming back to the braai, it is indeed not a coincidence that after our more 
light-​hearted exchange about racial identities, Walters emphasized how their 
	4	 I capitalize the racial labels when talking about the categories themselves as well as when 
referring to the people that are and were classified as such by the South African government. 
This enables me to name highly contested social realities. It does not reflect my personal 
opinion on the merit of these labels. Some South Africans embrace the racial labels and oth­
ers vehemently reject them.
	5	 I elaborate on these groups in Chapter 2. However, I flag already here that there are both 
proponents and critics of the terms ‘San’ and ‘Bushmen’, including its Afrikaans variant 
Boesmans (see Smith 1998; Ellis 2015).
	6	 At various points in this text, I reflect on why Khoisan revivalists prefer specific forms of 
identification over others. However, an in-​depth examination of identification preferences 
remains to be written.

Introduction
continued circulation had important consequences for people like him. ‘All 
of this land used to belong to us and we are going to claim it all back’, he 
proclaimed with a sense of urgency. He felt being designated Coloured dis­
avowed his claims to the land as Khoisan. A conversation ensued about how 
the lack of property ownership and redress for historical injustices, such as 
the forced removals that took place during apartheid and uprooted countless 
families from their homes (see Chapter 2), is linked to present-​day socioeco­
nomic ills plaguing the areas where Coloureds live. We were sitting in such an 
area, Bellville South. Neighborhoods of Cape Town such as these struggle with 
community violence, unemployment, sexual assault, break-​ins, carjacking, 
organized crime, substance abuse, and lack of infrastructure (Jensen 1999,76; 
2006; Pinnock 2016, 12, 101). Taken together, the area where most Coloured and 
Black Capetonians live is known as the Cape Flats –​ a loosely defined low-​lying 
sand-​swept and flood-​prone expanse to the north of Table of Mountain, which 
separates it from the Central Business District. The Cape Flats is notorious for 
having one of the world’s highest per capita murder rates (Pinnock 2016, 8–​
9). The government has at times resorted to deploying the army to patrol the 
area and quell the violence; most recently between September 2019 and March 
2020 (Bernardo 2020).
As they themselves continuously emphasize, it is against this backdrop 
of violence and marginalization that people like Walters, Burns, and Revell 
are finding comfort, meaning, and political leverage in Khoisan identity. As 
Walters explained during the braai, Coloureds embracing this long-​lost her­
itage are not only fulfilling a strong psychological need but are also using 
this heritage as a vehicle for their political emancipation and socioeconomic 
advancement: ‘They may have taken our heritage away piece by piece, but each 
of us are putting back those pieces to make the puzzle whole again’. Tapping on 
my shoulder and touching on the history of European knowledge production 
about the Khoisan and the complexities of doing field research in light of this 
(see below), he told me: ‘Even you are part of the revival, my bru [my brother]’. 
I suppose he had a point. I had suggested a braai in large part so that Walters 
and Burns, who were relatively new to the scene, could meet Revell, a seasoned 
activist. And sure enough, she introduced them to the ins and outs of Khoisan 
politics that evening; not unlike the way she had educated me over the years. 
Revell had come a long way since I first met her in 2014 at her home in Bishop 
Lavis, one of the most violent neighbourhoods of the city. She has since moved 
to a slightly more stable part of Cape Town. In 2012, she had formally joined 
the Katz Korana Royal House, a Khoisan traditional leadership entity based 
in the Northern Cape Province, and took up a position as ‘Princess’ in 2017. 
Princess Chantal Revell, as she is since known, opened the 2019 State of the

Nation Address alongside another well-​known Khoisan activist, Bradley van 
Sitters. While the media focused entirely on Van Sitters, who in a historical 
first praised President Cyril Ramaphosa in the Khoekhoegowab language, 
I instantly recognized Revell in the pictures in the newspapers (Etheridge 2019; 
see Chapter 6). Seeing her in Parliament in full regalia at the State of the Union 
Address that marked 25 years since the end of apartheid, I reflected on her long 
journey, and on how much more visible and assertive the Khoisan had become 
during the years we had known each other (see Figure 1).
Evidence of this was indeed rapidly accruing. About a month after the braai, 
on 28 September 2019, the ‘Khoisan Heritage Festival’ took place at the Castle 
of Good Hope in central Cape Town. Constructed in the mid-​17th century, the 
Castle was the epicentre of colonialism in Southern Africa. Organizing the cel­
ebration at the oldest surviving colonial building in South Africa was there­
fore highly symbolic. During the well-​attended festival –​ Walter’s brainchild

Introduction
but supported and sponsored by various others –​ several Khoisan artists per­
formed music, poetry, and dance (Rochey Walters, personal communication, 
03/​03/​2020). Items related to Khoisan culture were on sale, ranging from 
tea and art, to soap and t-​shirts. At the same venue, about two months ear­
lier, I had attended the launch of Poetry Revolution, a poetry collection cele­
brating the Khoisan past, penned by another passionate Khoi activist, Basil 
Coetzee (Coetzee 2019a). Further back in time still, in 2015, I regularly went to 
the Castle to attend Khoekhoegowab classes by the aforementioned Van Sitters. 
One of the main hurdles, which the teacher shared with most of his students, 
was commuting from the Cape Flats to the city centre. Nevertheless, classes 
were usually well attended, bearing testimony to people’s commitment and 
determination to learn the language and reconnect with the Khoisan past. 
But perhaps no event at the Castle made me appreciate the widespread reso­
nance (and spirituality) of Khoisan identity more than the ‘Resurrection Day’ 
celebration I attended in April 2018 (see Figure 2). The idea for the gathering 
was Revell’s, who organized it together with the leadership of the New Hope 
Church based in Retreat, where she was working as a secretary and office man­
ager at the time. As speakers celebrated the Khoisan and stressed the histori­
cal and spiritual significance of their celebration at such a ‘traumatic’ site, the 
crowd responded with resounding applause and cheers (see Chapter 4).
I found myself at the Castle on countless other occasions, but it is only one 
of the many settings where the Khoisan are becoming increasingly visible. 
I explicitly went to look for manifestations of Khoisan identity in Cape Town, 
but sometimes I came across Khoisan-​related images, objects, and ideas by 
coincidence. When I was walking on Long Street, one of the city’s most pop­
ular streets, I spotted a sign that read ‘Khoisan indigenous teas /​ KhoiKoffee’. 
As I chatted to the owner over a cup of buchu tea moments later, he explained 
that his shop sought to promote indigenous knowledge about plants, herbs, 
and tea. Sadly, the business was not financially viable and had to close its 
doors soon after. However, sometime later I found another establishment in 
Long Street that also had ‘indigenous teas’ on offer. Going to the supermarket, 
I similarly came across ‘Khoisan Tea’, not too far from the isle where ‘Bushman 
Hot Sauce’ and ‘Khoisan Salt’ were also for sale.7 Khoisan-​related events also 
regularly featured in the news. Over the years I have asked South Africans if 
they noticed the increased visibility of all things Khoisan and hardly anyone 
had not picked up on this. Many would point to the ongoing campaign to

rename Cape Town International Airport after Krotoa, an indigenous Khoisan 
woman who interpreted for Dutch colonialists in the mid-​17th century (see 
Chapter 4). Others would mention the protesters who have been camping 
outside of the Union Buildings in Pretoria on and off since 2017 to demand 
indigenous rights (Mitchley 2019). Yet others mentioned the Traditional and 
Khoi-​San Leadership Act (tkla), which was signed into law on 28 November 
2019. The tkla stipulates the criteria for the official recognition of Khoisan 
traditional leadership for the first time in history. Whether seen as a positive or 
negative development –​ this is certainly widely contested among the Khoisan 
themselves (see Chapter 3) –​ the tkla confirms the increased involvement of 
the political establishment in Khoisan matters, and indeed the wider phenom­
enon of ‘Khoisan revivalism’ that is at the core of this book.

Introduction
Khoisan since the end of apartheid in 1994. As I will show, Khoisan identity is 
at the core of protests, celebrated at cultural events, debated on social media, 
contested in parliament and sold as consumables. An ever greater number 
of people have been challenging the assumption that the Khoisan are (virtu­
ally) extinct by self-​identifying as Khoisan in the post-​apartheid era. The term 
‘Khoisan revival’ has been suggested to describe this phenomenon, including 
by the Khoisan themselves (Bredekamp 2001; Besten 2006). ‘Revival’ implies 
that ‘the Khoisan’ ‘died’ at one point in time, which offends those who claim 
to have always been aware of their Khoisan ancestry (De Wet 2006, 14–​15).8 
When I speak of ‘revival’, I do not discount claims of continuity but rather refer 
to both the undeniable lingering effects of the suppression of Khoisan identity 
during colonialism and apartheid, as well as the numerous efforts that seek 
its present-​day reinvigoration in various spheres of South African society (see 
also Forte 2006, 13). This sets ‘Khoisan revivalist’ apart from one of the alter­
natives, ‘neo-​Khoisan’ (Besten 2006), which implies a more rigid distinction 
based on essence (cf. Brown and Deumert 2017, 573). Khoisan revivalists dif­
fer from ‘other’ Khoisan in relative terms, because they are arguably engaged 
in different activities. Indeed, as I clarify below, revivalism refers to a process 
rather than an essence and therefore captures that which is markedly different, 
both in quantity and quality, in the salience of Khoisan issues post-​1994. With 
these caveats in mind, I suggest the following working definition of Khoisan 
revivalism:
The increasing affinity towards, and politicization of, the Khoisan in post-​
apartheid South Africa, deriving mostly from a critical interrogation of 
the identity label Coloured, especially among those currently classified 
as such, whereby some (re)claim Khoisan identities, indigenous status 
and/​or land and leadership titles.9
	8	 Some have perhaps for these reasons suggested other terms to denote the same phenome­
non. Richard Lee (2003, 100) for instance speaks of a ‘Khoisan renaissance’ and Siv Øvernes 
(Øvernes 2019, 10) wondered if ‘revitalisation’ might not be a more suitable alternative.
	9	 While not an attempt at a definition, June Bam-​Hutchison’s remarks are relevant here: ‘The 
overarching current contentious heritage issue for “contemporary” Khoisan communities 
appears to be the notion of “identity” and its concomitant “sense of belonging”. Both inform 
a range of contemporary campaigns: land restitution and justice; language diversity revival­
ism; constitutional accommodation; appropriating education and knowledge systems; occu­
pying sacred and ancestral spaces; indigenous “self-identification”; and returning human 
remains’ (Bam 2014, 123).

This deliberately open-​ended definition captures the breadth of activities 
that Khoisan ‘revivalists’ are engaged in, at least with regards to Cape Town, 
where my definition is primarily based on (see Chapter 1). As my opening seg­
ment illustrates, Khoisan revivalism entails cultural performances and pleas 
for socioeconomic justice. Many Khoisan revivalists also claim indigenous 
rights, traditional leadership titles and land. For reasons already mentioned, 
most people do not associate Cape Town with a contemporary Khoisan pres­
ence. I only made the connection myself after looking into the South African 
government’s stated intent to accommodate Khoisan land claims in the con­
text of my ma thesis in 2014 (Verbuyst 2015). At that point in time I knew little 
about the Khoisan. The term evoked scenes set in the Kalahari Desert in the 
north of the country. This is where I envisioned I would carry out my fieldwork, 
but I still have yet to set foot there after all these years. From the moment I saw 
a newspaper article featuring a group of Khoisan protesters in Cape Town, 
I have focused on the city’s Khoisan revivalist scene, including during my PhD 
research (Verbuyst 2021). More than anything else, I was eager to find out more 
about who these people were and what was driving them. Few academics had 
anticipated anything like a Khoisan revival taking place post-​1994; a notewor­
thy exception being Andrew Smith (1983, 47–​48), who identified a ‘potential 
resurgence of historical tradition’ back in 1983: ‘People of the Cape can look 
back to their ancestors in this land […] The links with the past remain in spite 
of attempts to obliterate them’. Indeed, from a researcher’s point of view, Cape 
Town is an intriguing case study: ‘people’ thought to no longer ‘exist’ are now 
‘seemingly’ and ‘suddenly’ back and seeking various forms of restitution and 
recognition.
While precise figures on the number of Khoisan revivalists do not exist (cf. 
Le Fleur and Jansen 2013, 1), nowhere is Khoisan revivalism more vibrant than 
in Cape Town. And yet, paradoxically, as one interlocutor is fond of saying, it 
is where ‘the bomb of colonialism fell and did most damage’.10 The Khoisan at 
the Cape bore the brunt of colonialism, which fed the myth of their supposed 
disappearance. To be sure, centuries of historical change complicate the link 
between Khoisan revivalists and their 17th century counterparts. A productive 
interrogation of Khoisan revivalism therefore requires being cognizant of the 
interplay between historical, biographical and societal contexts. This brings to 
mind Walters’ puzzle-​metaphor I shared earlier: if Khoisan revivalism is about 
putting pieces of a puzzle back together, what do the pieces and the end result 
	10	
Ngugi wa Thiongo (1986, 3) famously likened the impact of colonialism to the dropping 
of a ‘cultural bomb’. This description of Cape Town might very well be inspired by his 
writings.

Introduction
look like? Studying this puzzle triggers all manner of reflections at the inter­
section of anthropology and history. What drives people like Walters or Revell? 
Why do people put up with hours of traffic to reach the Khoekhoegowab classes 
at the Castle or campaign for Cape Town International Airport to be renamed 
after Krotoa? When did Khoisan revivalism take off and who were its pioneers? 
How do you ‘revive’ a ‘culture’, let alone an ‘identity’? How do you prove that 
you are not ‘extinct’ and how do you leverage that survival to demand historical 
justice in the face of great scepticism? How has the state responded to Khoisan 
revivalism? Since Khoisan revivalists speak of both historical and contempo­
rary oppression, how do they relate to their fellow South Africans of different 
backgrounds? These types of questions have captivated me ever since I began 
studying Khoisan revivalism in 2014. Looking back, they can be encapsulated 
in terms of a basic enquiry: how and why do Khoisan revivalists engage with the 
past? In the remainder of this introduction, I explain how I translated my main 
interest into research questions and looked for theoretical inspiration accord­
ingly. Firstly, however, I need to position myself vis-​à-​vis the existing research 
on Khoisan revivalism.

Researching Khoisan Revivalism: Challenges and Opportunities
2.1	
Khoisan Identity in Post-​apartheid South Africa: Debating 
Instrumentalism
As I will show in greater detail in Chapter 2, early research on the Khoisan 
was preoccupied with features that supposedly made them ‘living fossils’: their 
ancient archaeological record, physical features, click languages, and mori­
bund culture. While times have changed, studies continue to be biased towards 
areas where the ‘remaining Khoisan’ are located, that is, the Kalahari Desert’s 
reaches into Namibia, Botswana and to a lesser extent, South Africa. Scholars 
have consequently written mainly about the San, and to a far lesser extent the 
Griqua, both groups residing mostly outside Cape Town and therefore believed 
to evidence a greater degree of continuity with the past (see e.g. Waldman 
2007a; 2007b). As the apartheid regime was on its way out, however, Khoisan 
identity began to be overtly mobilized in other locations and among differ­
ent groups of people than academics were accustomed to. Some anthropolo­
gists took notice and the first study on Khoisan revivalism (as I have defined 
it) followed suit. In their pioneering publication, South African anthropolo­
gists John Sharp and Emile Boonzaier (1994) studied the mobilization of Nama 
identity in the Northern Richtersveld in the Northern Cape in the 1990s. The 
authors wondered why the inhabitants had recently traded in their identity as

Coloured for ‘Nama’, a subgroup of the Khoisan, since, ‘by any ‘objective’ mea­
sure of similarity to, and difference from, the culture of the pre-​colonial inhab­
itants of the region, contemporary people are less Nama than their forebears 
were’ (ibid., 405). Sharp and Boonzaier (ibid., 406–​407) argued that this shift 
in identification was linked to debates about a recently established national 
park in the area. By claiming an indigenous identity, residents could bolster 
their claims to the land and, by extension, their rights to benefit from, and be 
included in, the establishment of the park. Inspired by Hobsbawn and Ranger’s 
(1983) famous thesis on the invention of tradition, Sharp and Boonzaier con­
cluded that Nama identity was therefore a ‘controlled performance’:
It is role-​playing, in many ways like acting on a stage. [They] identify 
strongly with the part they play […] at the same time they are able, as good 
actors are, to step back, out of character, and consider their part from a 
distance […] [T]‌hose who assert this identity do so with a conviction that 
is tempered by a self-​conscious reflexivity.
sharp and boonzaier 1994, 415
It is important to note that the authors were writing in the tradition of so-​called 
exposé anthropology, the strand of social anthropology that had for decades 
opposed volkekunde, the pro-​apartheid branch of anthropology premised 
on biologically determined ethnic groups and races (Sharp 1988, 79; Dubow 
1994, 361). According to volkekundiges, ethnicity and race –​ the two were often 
conflated –​ were not in themselves in need of explanation but could explain 
behaviour (Sharp 1981; Gordon 1988; Van der Waal 2015). The apartheid regime 
relied on volkekunde to justify their ideology of separate development, that 
is, the belief that ethnic groups were best serviced (and exploited) by catering 
to their distinct ethnic needs. Academics like Sharp and Boonzaier countered 
with a social-​constructivist worldview: identities, ethnicities and much else 
are best understood not as self-​evident but as the result of dynamic and com­
plex processes of social construction (Alvesson and Sköldberg 2009, 24). As the 
name implies, exposé ethnography applied this critique to ‘expose’ the con­
structed nature of the notions ethnicity, race, or tribe that apartheid was built 
on (Robins 1996, 16). To many, these were in fact forms of false consciousness 
(Wilmsen, Dubow and Sharp 1994, 347). Inspired by Marxism, critics argued 
that such concepts were exploited by elites in the pursuit of socioeconomic 
resources or domination over others. Race and ethnicity were masking what 
‘really’ mattered: class (Van Wyk 2013a, 71; Sylvain 2014, 254). With a new South 
Africa around the corner, Sharp and Boonzaier were therefore uneasy about

Introduction
the mobilization of Khoisan ethnicity.11 While their analysis was nuanced, they 
clearly intended to bring the point across that, as the title of their piece stated, 
‘lessons’ had to be learned from the fact that Nama ethnicity was being used as 
an instrument to attain something else.
Reacting to their article, Steven Robins wondered if such an instrumen­
talist reading did not prevent taking away other important ‘lessons’. By see­
ing ethnicity as a performance, Sharp and Boonzaier were implying that the 
‘true’ identity of the Nama was that of assimilated Coloureds, thereby failing 
to appreciate that ‘cultural hybridity, fragmentation, and inconsistency’ was 
the devastating outcome of colonialism (Robins 1997, 26). To Robins, Nama 
identity was not ‘a shrewd and calculated performance of an aboriginal past 
while living a Westernised and modern present’ but ‘an act of recuperation 
and memory’, with meaning outside public or political settings as well. Robins 
(ibid., 40) was not denying that ethnicity was also being used instrumentally 
but that this did not diminish the claims to the past of those involved. Instead 
of focusing on inconsistencies and contradictions, he pleaded for a hybrid 
view of Khoisan culture and identity (Jackson and Robins 1999, 92). Robins 
also suggested that the ‘controlled performance’ was better understood as a 
form of strategic essentialism, a term coined by Gayatri Spivak (1988, 216) to 
highlight the self-​conscious mobilization of ‘essentialisms’, that is, (stereotyp­
ical) images and ideas that reduce reality to a singular essence in the pursuit 
or socioeconomic or political resources ‘from below’ (Robins 2003b, 278; see 
also Phillips 2010, 48, Eide 2016, 2). For Robins (2003a, 131), this theoretical 
framework allowed him not only to avoid uncritically endorsing essentialist 
claims but also to deconstruct what he saw as the ‘weapons of the weak’ –​ a 
point that was also made by some of his colleagues (White 1995, 51; Lee 2006, 
471). Crucially, this not only took the agency of the Khoisan into account but 
also the context in which they operated (Robins 2000, 58). Through nuanced 
readings of the mobilization of Khoisan identity in land claims and tourist set­
tings, authors like Robins pointed out how Khoisan revivalism was not simply 
a means to an end but an expression of a post-​colonial condition.
The late historian Michael Paul Besten, whose work on Khoisan revivalism 
spans over a decade (2000–​2011), elaborated on this hypothesis. Like Robins, 
he was unconvinced by what he called ‘crude instrumentalism’ (i.e. Khoisan 
	11	
The authors were not alone in expressing their concern. Most notably Robert Gordon 
(1992) had argued earlier that class issues among Khoisan in Namibia had been concealed 
by a ‘Bushman myth’. It is also worth nothing that around this time the historical continu­
ity of Khoisan identity was fiercely debated by archeologists and anthropologists in the 
so-​called Kalahari debate (see Chapter 2).

identity as simply a means to an end) and instead regarded Khoisan revival­
ism as ‘an expression of extreme psychological, cultural, or material disem­
powerment’ (Besten 2000, 4–​8), expressed through ‘acts of reclamation and 
reaffirmation of identity and heritage’ (Besten 2011b, 180). Besten argued that 
colonial and apartheid-​era thinking impacted both what Khoisan revivalism 
looked like and how it was perceived in South African society. He for instance 
showed how historians such as George McCall Theal (1837–​1919) and their 
legacy of stereotypes and falsehoods about the Khoisan haunt contemporary 
thinking and research, most notably in history textbooks (Besten 2011a). While 
much of his work explicitly seeks to move past ‘crude instrumentalism’, the 
closing sections of his PhD thesis on Griqua identity from 1894 to 2004 does 
arguably apply such a lens to the ‘antics’ of non-​Griqua Khoisan revivalists in 
Cape Town (Besten 2006, 296). This demographic, he argues, mostly mobi­
lizes ‘coloured concerns’ through the vehicle of Khoisan identity, for example 
in reaction to affirmative action policies. Besten seems somewhat guilty of a 
double standard here. While the Griqua and their engagements with Coloured 
identity merit closer historical scrutiny, the Cape Town-​based Khoisan reviv­
alists are somehow less complicated, less deserving of in-​depth examination. 
I cannot fault Besten for not incorporating first-​hand encounters with Khoisan 
revivalists in his analysis –​ he mostly refers to newspaper articles when talking 
about them –​ as his PhD dissertation mainly consists of a reconstruction of 
Griqua history. Nor are his arguments about Khoisan revivalism in Cape Town 
entirely unfounded. I wonder, however, how much his views would have dif­
fered had he engaged in a more directed and sustained way with the people he 
was writing about –​ or for that matter, why some of his other writings on the 
subject were more nuanced.
There is a pattern here: an almost default scepticism towards Khoisan 
revivalism in Cape Town in particular, often based on scant empirical data. 
According to critics, Khoisan revivalists are opportunistically mobilizing essen­
tialisms, peddling inflated and inaccurate claims, and promoting retrograde 
traditionalism and ethnic chauvinism (see e.g. Adhikari 2005, 186; Oomen 
2005, 113; Erasmus 2017, 113–​114, 119; 2019, 498–​499). Ciraj Rassool (2009, 115–​
116) for instance believed Khoisan revivalism was in essence ‘a belated pitch for 
an accelerated route to ethnic formation in the name of Indigenous identity’, 
ironically taking place after apartheid. Others, like Besten, argued that Khoisan 
revivalism (in Cape Town) was to a great extent cloaked Coloured identity 
politics (Hendricks 2004, 123–​125; Fauvelle-​Aymar 2006; Ruiters 2009; Jacobs 
and Levenson 2018). ‘[N]othing less than a form of brown nationalism’, as one 
pundit put it (Kombuis 2013). These critics tend to view the persistence of 
race and ethnicity as a dangerous intellectual mistake, the remaining vestiges

Introduction
of which still need dismantlement (Furlong 2012, 58; Winkler 2017; Rassool 
2019, 365; see Conclusion). However, this unidimensional line of reasoning 
conflates identity constructions from below with top-​down manipulations by 
colonialists, leaving little room for agency and foreclosing the possibility that 
Khoisan revivalism is about Khoisan-​related issues as well. In their ‘unreflec­
tive deconstructionism’ (Sylvain 2014: 259), such critiques seem disinterested 
in the contextual and postcolonial factors Robins and others highlighted. To be 
sure, as I will show, critics diagnose worrying trends in Khoisan revivalism, but 
Khoisan revivalists do not all share the same motivations or politics. Khoisan 
revivalism also has a role in private, non-​political life. It might be embedded in 
several political contexts, but it is not reducible to them (see also Alcoff 2000).
In short: however useful in discerning certain aspects of Khoisan revivalism, 
instrumentalism’s a priori framing of ethnic identity as an invention or essen­
tialism that is strategically mobilized to procure power and resources bespeaks 
a lack of curiosity in its various other meanings. These meanings might explain 
Khoisan revivalism’s appeal more so than explanations that solely focus on the 
politics of entitlement. I will give countless other examples in the pages that 
follow to make this point, but take the Khoekhoegowab classes at the Castle 
I mentioned earlier, for instance. How is this ‘cloaked Coloured identity pol­
itics’ or a promotion of ethnic chauvinism? If the goal is to account for such 
activities in order to arrive at a more comprehensive understanding of Khoisan 
revivalism, the analysis needs to appreciate the specific processes and moti­
vations that drive Khoisan revivalists. This not only entails complementing 
instrumentalist understandings and taking contextual factors into account but 
also requires looking beyond land claims or tourist settings to more unconven­
tional sites. As I show next, it is perhaps not surprising therefore that research 
on Khoisan revivalism in Cape Town is currently laying the groundwork for 
such an approach.

Khoisan Revivalism in Cape Town: Reorienting the Research Agenda 
Towards Identification, Emic Perspectives, and Indigeneity
When Norwegian anthropologist Siv Øvernes (2019, 1, 3) initiated her fieldwork 
among people living on the streets of Cape Town in the late 1990s, she was sur­
prised to find an awareness of Khoisan identity among them. As she recounts 
in her recent monograph Street KhoiSan: On belonging, recognition and survival 
(Øvernes 2019) –​ to date the most in-​depth examination of Khoisan revival­
ism in Cape Town –​ the experiences of her interlocutors resonated strongly 
with her own relationship to her Sami and Kven ancestry. As with Khoisan 
identity, the latter were for a long time supressed in the context of assim­
ilationist policies but were once again widely asserted in recent decades

in Sápmi, Northern Scandinavia. Throughout her book, Øvernes weaves these 
autoethnographic reflections into sensitive explorations of ‘the appearance of 
a people presumed dead’ (see Oevernes 2002, 173). She found little evidence to 
back up an instrumentalist explanation of why this was occurring, so decided 
instead to explore how Khoisan identity provided a strong psychological sense 
of belonging. Rather than scrutinizing whether her interlocutors are ‘indige­
nous’ (see below), she explored why it was ‘meaningful to claim this identity 
in today’s Cape Town’ (ibid.). While Steven Robins and Michael Besten had 
previously pleaded to take Khoisan belonging seriously, Øvernes’ work is 
ground-​breaking for the extent to which it explores this argument through eth­
nographic fieldwork in Cape Town, where continuity with the Khoisan past is 
often deemed to be most problematic. She ultimately narrows down her argu­
ment about Khoisan identity among people living on the streets of Cape Town 
to ‘five dimensions’:
[A]‌ sense of having been tricked at some early stage which has led to the 
current situation of powerlessness and poverty; having been reminded 
of this connection though stigmatising referrals and branding by others; 
ideas and knowledge about family connections to the people of the arid 
Karoo; certain values of sharing which were spoken of as ‘the ways of our 
people’; and finally, self-​naming. The latter is by far the most important. 
What people say about themselves should never be ignored.
øvernes 2019, 230
As I will show, Øvernes’ take on Khoisan identity is directly relevant for my 
own observations, particularly the links between socioeconomic marginal­
ization and identity, references to areas outside of Cape Town as embodying 
continuity with the Khoisan past (in her case, the Karoo), and, indeed, most of 
all the emphasis on ‘self-​naming’. While Øvernes leads the way in taking ‘what 
people say about themselves’ seriously, researchers have looked into Khoisan 
revivalism in recent years with similar methods and questions. Justin Brown 
and Ana Deumert (2017), Shanade Barnabas and Samukelisiwe Miya (Barnabas 
and Miya 2019), and Heike Becker (Becker 2017) have written about language 
activism and the motivations behind the revival of Khoekhoegowab (in Cape 
Town). William Ellis (2019) has recently published an ethnographic interpre­
tation of Khoisan traditional leadership, including among Khoisan revivalists. 
Aside from my own work on indigeneity and land claims (Verbuyst 2015, 2016), 
Chizuko Sato (2018), Duane Jethro (2017) and Katharina Schramm (2016) have 
also written on the subject. Scholars that openly identify as Khoisan have 
increasingly contributed to these debates, such as Berte van Wyk (2014) and

Introduction
June Bam-​Hutchison (Bam 2014; Bam-​Hutchison, 2016).12 Bam-​Hutchison’s 
work is especially relevant, as it deals with issues of identity, belonging, and 
social justice in the Cape Town area.13 This re-​orientation in the research 
agenda is also discernible in studies that do not deal with Cape Town: for 
example Sarah Ives’ ethnography of the Rooibos industry in the Cederberg 
region (2017), the popularising ethnographies of the Hessequa and Karretjie 
people by Michael de Jongh (2012, 2016), or Sharon Gabie’s (2014, 2018) study 
of the aforementioned Katz-​Korana Royal House in the Northern Cape and 
everyday Khoisan belonging. I also note the significance of Itunu Bodunrin’s 
PhD research about !Xun14 and Khwe identity in Platfontein (2018). His work 
pioneers the study of urban Khoisan identities outside of Cape Town, although 
the potential of such an approach for the study of Khoisan revivalism was 
already noted by Piet Erasmus in 2012, who conducted research on the revival 
of Korana identity in the Free State Province (Erasmus 2012).
These studies, which I engage with more thoroughly in later chapters, not 
only show the increased attention towards Khoisan revivalism in Cape Town 
and elsewhere but also a shift from ‘identity’ to identification, in which I dis­
cern a promising research agenda. Whereas classical approaches to ethnicity/​
identity viewed these as bounded ‘innate’ units, the seminal work of Frederick 
Barth (1969) reframed them as dynamic outcomes of a complex process of social 
construction (see also Banks 1996, 12). The research on Khoisan revivalism 
I mentioned in the previous section used such a lens to study the contextual 
factors that make Khoisan identity politically meaningful, but the abovemen­
tioned work adds another dimension by also examining emic perspectives, 
that is, what the identity means to the people themselves, rather than the so-​
called ‘etic’ meaning that others ascribe to it (see Chapter 1). Various anthro­
pologists have advocated for more research on ethnicity along these lines as 
instrumentalism only partially accounts for its enduring appeal (Sharp 1997; 
De Jongh 2007; Becker 2010). Instead of asking what ethnicity is or studying the 
contexts that shape it, this kind of research asks why it is meaningful for those

June Bam-​Hutchison has also written a novel under the penname ‘Musuva’ (2010), which 
explores, among other things, the role of Khoisan belonging for Coloureds in Cape Town 
during apartheid and the overall devastating legacy of colonialism. Please note that Bam 
and Bam-​Hutchison refer to the same author.

Rethinking Africa. Indigenous Women Re-​Interpret Southern Africa’s Pasts (2021), edited by 
June Bam and Bernedette Muthien, appeared just prior to the publication of this book, 
and I could therefore not meaningfully engage with it. However, because of its important 
contribution to the field, I do want to mention it here.

who identify with it (see e.g. Alcoff 2000, 325; Hale 2004, 463; Jenkins 2008, 
11). These emic perspectives have ‘real’ effects on what Rogers Brubaker and 
Frederick Cooper (2000, 18–​20) referred to as the understanding of self, group­
ness, and the social world at large. In following Brubaker’s (2004) suggestion 
to avoid reducing ethnicity automatically to groups, Khoisan identity –​ which 
I use as a synonym of Khoisan ‘identification’ for stylistic reasons only (on this 
point, see Jenkins 2008, 14–​15) –​ is understood as unfolding in both political 
and existential contexts (see also Banks 1996, 182). In conforming to this rea­
soning, Andreas Wimmer’s (2008, 973) Weberian definition of ethnicity as ‘a 
subjectively felt sense of belonging based on the belief in shared culture and 
ancestry’ is satisfyingly succinct. To better understand how individuals reify 
such ‘subjectively felt senses’, Brubaker and Cooper (2000, 2, 5) suggest going 
‘beyond’ the analytical tools of ‘identity’ or ‘ethnicity’, and explain instead how 
and why interlocutors themselves experience and couch various moments, 
people, and contexts in those terms.
I take a similar approach with regards to the loaded term ‘indigenous’, which 
is central to Khoisan revivalism but considered particularly controversial in 
the South African context due to the many meanings that are attached to it. 
While my aim is not to evaluate whether Khoisan revivalists conform to a cer­
tain set of criteria to qualify as ‘indigenous’, I need to allocate some space to 
the contentious issues that this question gives rise to in a South African con­
text, as these will unavoidably resurface throughout the book and explicitly 
in the Conclusion.15 Perhaps the biggest controversy flows from indigeneity’s 
connotations of prior occupancy, that is, the question of who was the ‘first’ 
to settle in South Africa? There is some consensus that the San are the oldest 
inhabitants of Southern Africa. A 2010 publication in Nature even referred to 
the San as ‘the oldest known lineage of modern human’ in reference to the 
hypothesis that their descendants from roughly 100,000 years ago gave rise 
to modern humans (Moran 2009, 4; Schuster et al. 2010, 943). The rationale 
for distinguishing between Khoi and San in this regard relates to contested 
archaeological and historical evidence that suggests different modes of sub­
sistence: the former based on pastoralism, the latter on hunting and gath­
ering (see Chapter 2). If one accepts this distinction, then it entails that the 
Khoi came from northern Botswana (some say East Africa) to inhabitant the 
Western half of South Africa about 2000 years ago (Elphick and Malherbe 1989, 
	15	
Together with Lorenzo Veracini, I elaborated on indigeneity in South Africa from a settler-​
colonial studies’ perspective (Veracini and Verbuyst 2020). This theoretical framework 
however falls beyond the scope of this book. Alternate data and research questions would 
also better service such an enquiry.

Introduction
3; Lee 2006, 462; Barbieri et al. 2014, 446). Bantu-​speaking populations –​ whose 
origins are also disputed –​ settled the Eastern half of South Africa more or less 
1800 years ago (Parkington and Hall 2010, 70; Schlebusch et al. 2016, 1365). The 
final sizeable demographic shift occurred from the mid-​17th century onward, 
with the arrival of European settlers, and African and Asian slaves. The San are 
the only ones who can claim prior occupancy in this chronology; everyone else 
settled on South African soil later in time.
Yet who are the contemporary claimants of ‘San-​prior occupancy’ and on 
what basis? Archaeological and genetic evidence clearly suggests different 
migration patterns, but this does not give way to unscrupulously linking his­
torical populations to contemporary groups with the same modern ethnic 
categories (Parkington and Hall 2010, 70; Erasmus 2013, 46–​47; Ulrich 2015, 
19). Such simple equations leapfrog centuries of (conflictual) interactions, 
including changes in self-​identification. Various groups identify as San today, 
not least the many Khoisan revivalists who do not accept a (hard) distinction 
between Khoi and San. One could hypothetically look at certain genetic mark­
ers instead. While the genetic strain (haplogroup) associated with the Khoisan 
is most prevalent among Coloureds (although many non-​Khoisan descendants 
also came to be labelled as such, see Chapter 2), it also features prominently 
among Bantu-​speaking populations, and, to a lesser extent, among Afrikaners 
as well (Quintana-​Murci et al. 2010, 611; De Wet et al. 2010, 150; Barbieri et al. 
2014, 440). The question of how ‘much’ and which genetic criteria suffice in 
order to claim descent from the ‘first’ San is clearly arbitrary. It not only flirts 
with notions of genetic purity (cf. Erasmus 2013) but also flies in the face of 
a complex historical record of migration, assimilation, and change. Edward 
Cavanagh’s (2013) study of the Orange River valley in the Northern Cape shows 
this clearly. The area was originally inhabited by the San but settled at various 
points in time by different populations who displaced and assimilated each 
other in the process, including Europeans, Sotho-​Tswana peoples, but also 
Griqua, who are themselves largely made up of Khoisan descendants (see also 
Prins 2009, 108; Schlebush et al. 2016, 1365). Cavanagh (2013, 8, 15) argues on the 
basis of such entangled histories that South Africa is a country with ‘various 
degrees of indigeneity’. Others have similarly suggested that ‘[i]‌ndigeneity in 
South Africa is in fact layered. Waves of migration and immigration, over both 
land and sea, have produced degrees of indigeneity’ (McDonald 2016a, 76).
While these authors have stopped short of explaining what sets these 
‘degrees’ or ‘layers’ apart; they clearly intend to caution against clear-​cut dis­
tinctions between ‘indigenous’ and ‘non-​indigenous’ in a South African con­
text; particularly when tied to notions of prior occupancy and genetic descent. 
The case against legally defining certain groups in Africa as ‘indigenous’ is

often made on this basis as well, by arguing that indigeneity as an interna­
tional legal category is based on South America, whose history of migration 
and colonization differs significantly (Lehmann 2006; Pelican 2009; Hodgson 
2010a). As I explain in later chapters, this position also underpins the South 
African government’s unofficial stance on indigeneity, that is, all Africans are 
equally indigenous to South Africa. Academics too have rejected ‘indigenous’ 
as an analytical concept in part because of its connotations of prior occupancy. 
Adam Kuper’s polemical essay The Return of the Native (2003) stands out in 
this regard. Kuper not only warned that indigeneity embodied ahistorical 
conceptions of identity and culture but also that it was usually embedded in 
an inappropriate romanticism and retrograde politics. Anthropologists were 
ignoring that ‘indigenous’ is a instrumentalist re-​invention of the discred­
ited term ‘native’, or ‘primitive’, and instead took arguments made by indige­
nous people at face value out of a sense of political correctness and default 
activist stance (Kuper 2006, 22). This was a dangerous mistake, Kuper (2003, 
390) argued, as claims based on prior occupancy are not unlike the exclusion­
ary rhetoric of ‘blood and soil’ championed by certain right-​wing traditional­
ists and secessionists.
Responding to Kuper’s article, various pundits acknowledged that the con­
cept ‘indigenous’ might engender essentialist rhetoric on occasion but that it 
had to be retained since it refers to a distinct form of marginalization related 
to processes of assimilation and dispossession (Asch 2004; Gausset, Kenricks, 
and Gibb 2011). Campaigns to seek compensation for, and recognition of, this 
history should not be automatically cast as virtuous but also not dismissed 
‘as racist manipulations by unscrupulous opportunists’ who seek to advance 
exclusionary agendas (Ramos 2003, 398). While some might reduce indigene­
ity to prior occupancy, many relate the concept to various other factors as well. 
There is no internationally agreed-​upon definition, but it is common to refer 
to the so-​called Cobo-​definition that informs much of the United Nation’s dis­
course on indigeneity to argue that being indigenous relates to the following 
non-​exclusive criteria: occupation of a territory prior to the arrival of domi­
nant others, the maintenance of culturally distinct practices, self-​definition as 
indigenous, and historical and contemporary marginalization (Maybury-​Lewis 
2003, 324; Niezen 2003, 19; Merlan 2009, 305). Others responded to the type of 
criticism that Kuper put forward by pointing out that most indigenous people 
do not seek secession or a privileged position when they campaign for self-​
determination but seek equal rights and reparations from the state through the 
recognition of their distinct historical trajectories (Niezen 2003, 204; Kenrick 
and Lewis 2004, 9; Zenker 2011, 65). While recognizing that the two regularly 
overlap in practice, many have distinguished indigeneity from ‘autochthony’

Introduction
(i.e. the type of blood-​and-​soil rhetoric Kuper warned about) on this basis (see 
e.g. Geschiere 2011, 323). As Andrew Canessa (2014, 168) put it: ‘Discourses of 
indigeneity have as much potential to create hierarchy as to dismantle it’.
As I already noted with regards to critics of Khoisan revivalism in general, 
I will show how both the conflation of indigeneity and autochthony, as well as 
the mixture of empowerment and disempowerment is discernible among some 
Khoisan revivalists. My main issue with Kuper’s essay is therefore not with its 
observation that indigeneity can be used to advance exclusionary agendas but 
that he does not seem to acknowledge that there might be other (more import­
ant) reasons for why people identify with it. ‘Indigenous’ is not an ‘indigenous 
concept’, but to many it has come to be profoundly meaningful as an emic 
signifier (Canessa 2018, 316). As Ronald Niezen (2003, 221) put it: ‘It has been 
taken control of by its living subjects –​ reverse engineered, rearticulated, and 
put to use as […] an expression of identity, a badge worn with pride, revealing 
something significant and personal about its wearer’s collective attachments’. 
Studying indigeneity as an emic signifier therefore not only lays bare the var­
ied meanings it has for Khoisan revivalists but also the complexities that arise 
from its diverse ascriptions, that is, the tensions between Khoisan revivalists, 
the historical Khoisan, ‘indigenous’ as a legal category and indigeneity as lived 
experience. In the remainder of this introduction, I suggest a conceptualiza­
tion of indigeneity as an analytical lens in order to explore these emic interpre­
tations and tensions in the most productive way. I also identify further gaps in 
the research in the process. I begin by explaining how articulation theory helps 
to set up such a framework and then argue how a specific understanding of the 
role of the past in processes of indigenous revivalism is necessary to proceed 
with my research questions, which I detail in the final section.

Khoisan Revivalist Articulations of Indigeneity
If the goal is not to validate whether Khoisan revivalists are indigenous, but 
why and how they identify as such, one needs to move away from a priori defi­
nitions of the term and survey a diversity of interpretations instead. These 
can not only differ individually but also depend on the context. Indigeneity 
might be regarded as a legal concept, in terms of prior occupancy or a dis­
tinct mode of marginalization, but also in entirely unforeseen ways. To move 
beyond an ‘abstract indigeneity’ (Cowlishaw 2012, 398) and study its vari­
ous localized meanings instead, I found inspiration in ‘articulation theory’, a 
Gramscian approach first developed in the late 1970s by Ernesto Laclau but 
elaborated on by scholars such as Stuart Hall (Angus 1992, 539; Hirsch 2015,

104). For present purposes I single out Hall, as his work relates closely to the 
aforementioned literature on identification. For Hall, ‘articulation’ not only 
connotes the act of expressing something in language but also that of making 
and unmaking connections between elements that do not necessarily ‘belong’ 
together (Grossberg 1996, 141–​142). Studying articulations therefore entails 
unpacking the seeming ‘unity’ within a discourse, ideology, and, indeed, iden­
tity: under what conditions and at which moments are different articulations 
made, remade, and unmade? Nothing can be taken for granted or explained 
by only referencing political or economic contexts; the ways in which individ­
uals articulate these concepts to make sense of the social world around them 
is paramount. Applying this reasoning to identity and its relation to the past, 
Hall made the following observations that are highly relevant for research on 
indigeneity as well:
Cultural identity […] is a matter of ‘becoming’ as well as of ‘being’ […] 
Cultural identities come from somewhere, have histories. But, like every­
thing which is historical, they undergo constant transformation […] Far 
from being grounded in a mere ‘recovery’ of the past, which is waiting 
to be found, and which, when found, will secure our sense of ourselves 
into eternity, identities are the names we give to the different ways we are 
positioned by, and position ourselves within, the narratives of the past.
hall 1990, 225
James Clifford was one of the first to recognize the potential of articulation 
theory for the study of indigenous identities. To him, the biggest advantage was 
that it sidestepped the debate on the (in)authenticity of indigenous claims by 
underscoring diversity and complexity (Clifford 2013, 54). As with any other 
articulation, indigenous identity is a rearticulation taking place under cer­
tain conditions. It is these conditions and the creative selection of elements 
(from the past) that make up the articulation that Clifford and others have 
focused on in their research (Clifford 2003, 88–​90; see also Li 2000, 169). As 
Kim TallBear (2013, 512) notes, this includes ‘acts of borrowing, interpretation, 
and reconfiguration’. Whereas TallBear speaks of ‘indigenous articulations of 
indigeneity’, I prefer not to add the qualifier ‘indigenous’ since this presumes 
an unproblematic indigenous subject at the base of the articulation. While 
sensitive to the problem at hand, I do not seek to debunk or endorse claims to 
indigeneity. I am interested instead in why and how it is articulated and there­
fore speak of Khoisan revivalist articulations of indigeneity. Tania Li (2000) too 
preferred to speak of articulations of indigeneity in her study of indigenous 
identity in Indonesia. Li’s work is interesting because, like Clifford, she uses an

Introduction
ethnographic approach to hone in on the agency of the people doing the artic­
ulating, which forms the basis for her broader observations about where and 
when indigenous identities become pronounced (Li 2000, 153). However, like 
many of her colleagues, Li sticks to an analysis of articulations of indigeneity 
in the pursuit of political and economic resources, thereby running into the 
limits of instrumentalism pointed out earlier.
To be sure, it makes sense to focus on articulations in such contexts since 
entitlement claims regularly accompany claims to indigeneity. This also 
accounts for why much of the research on Khoisan revivalism has focused on 
land claims, including my own. However, as the limits of my previous research 
show, applying articulation theory to less politically charged settings as well 
has even more potential to unravel how indigeneity is shaped by Khoisan 
revivalists. While I did not use articulation theory in my ma thesis, I did some­
thing similar in practice. As I noted previously, I investigated what it meant 
for Khoisan revivalists in Cape Town to claim land. Through ethnographic 
research I came to the conclusion that claiming land, whether in abstract or 
concrete forms, was a way for Khoisan revivalists to express a wide range of 
grievances, some pertaining to land in the material sense but mostly relating 
to Coloured identity, indigenous rights, belonging and healing –​ a hypothesis 
I revisit later on in this book. These issues were tied to land in a ‘symbolic’ 
way, necessitating what I in accordance labelled a ‘symbolical interpretation’ 
of Khoisan activism and land claims (Verbuyst 2016). In a way, I was arguing for 
Khoisan land claims to be studied as articulations. I even noted that claiming 
land was a way of ‘articulating a sense of loss […] where hopes, frustrations 
and histories, both contemporary and distant, become enmeshed’ (ibid., 93). 
Despite this language of enmeshing and articulating, I did not explore the full 
implications of studying Khoisan indigeneity as an articulation. During my ini­
tial fieldwork I had come across various facets of Khoisan revivalism that were 
not articulated in relation to land or even explicitly political in nature, which 
made me wonder to what extent the arguments I made about land being a 
‘symbolic’ issue were relevant for Khoisan revivalism in general.
As I embarked on further research with articulation theory in mind, I became 
convinced that Khoisan revivalism is not so much a ‘movement’ with clear 
boundaries and aims –​ my assumption in my ma thesis –​ as it is a multifaceted 
phenomenon (i.e. articulation) affecting people in different ways and often 
for different reasons (see Chapter 1). Indigeneity is not articulated by Khoisan 
revivalists in a univocal manner, and I aim to scrutinize the various linkages 
that it engenders in order to appreciate the concept’s diverse roles in Khoisan 
revivalism. While the potential of articulation theory to study Khoisan identity 
has been noted by Shanade Barnabas and Samukelisiwe Miya (2019; see also

Erasmus 2017, 54), further exploration and theorizing is required. The litera­
ture on the concept of ‘indigeneity’ itself points the way forward. In line with 
the shift towards identification in the study of identity and indeed echoing 
premises of articulation theory, scholars have moved away from bounded defi­
nitions of indigeneity. The term has instead come to be theorized as a process 
of becoming (Byrd and Rothberg 2011, 3). Like much else in the social world, 
it is articulated by diverse actors in relation to various histories and represen­
tations (De la Cadena and Starn 2007, 3). With its connotations of prior occu­
pancy in relation to others, indigeneity is not only geographically bounded 
but also relational and retrospective (ibid., 398). For this reason it has been 
described as a form of historical consciousness, forward looking but anchored 
in the past (Graham and Penny 2014, 2). As Andrew Canessa (2008, 358) put it, 
‘indigeneity is best understood as a contemporary social relation articulated 
in terms of the past’. This leads to a rather obvious realization on the face it, 
namely that the past is central to articulations of indigeneity, including those 
by Khoisan revivalists.
While Keyan Tomaselli (2012c, 48) and Katharina Schramm (2016, 131) have 
advanced past-​oriented approaches to indigeneity in the context of the 
Khoisan, and Itunu Bodunrin (2018, 75) wondered how his interlocutors in 
Platfontein constructed their indigeneity in relation to the past, an in-​depth 
investigation of the uses of the past within Khoisan revivalism remains to 
be carried out. Due to the predominance of instrumentalism, the role of the 
past has often been reduced to a reservoir of figures and events that can be 
called upon to buttress socioeconomic or political claims. Richard Lee already 
flagged the limits of this approach roughly twenty years ago, when he wrote 
that ‘the issue of San and Khoi historical memory has barely been addressed’ 
(Lee 2003, 84) and called for an ‘expanded anthropology’ that would be able to 
appreciate how Khoisan revivalism generates new ways of studying indigene­
ity (Lee and Hitchcock 2001, 273). To understand Khoisan revivalism’s appeal 
and aspirations, one needs to appreciate what I will loosely refer to as ‘emic 
histories’16 –​ a concept I explore in greater detail in Chapter 7: the various ways 
in which the events, figures, and cultural practices of the Khoisan past inform 
the equally divergent discourses and practices of Khoisan revivalists. If every­
thing is indeed about their ‘history’, as the interlocutor in the opening quote 
suggests, it is key to learn what roles that past plays in their lives. While artic­
ulation theory lays bare the ways in which indigeneity is constructed, it does 
not say much about why this is the case (see also Hirsch 2015, 109). Some of the

Introduction
authors I mentioned previously have already begun to explore this question. 
To assist in this exploration, I argue next why I based my enquiry on a concep­
tualization of indigenous revivalism that centres on the relationship between 
past and present.
4	
Indigenous Revivalism and Emic Histories: The Past in the Present
Earlier, I introduced Khoisan revivalism as ‘a recent phenomenon about 
an ancient past’ to suggest it is as much about the present as it is about the 
past. While I get to the relevant research on indigenous revivalism below, it is 
important to note that the relationship between past and present has received 
increased attention in recent years. Historians in particular have urged their 
colleagues to break with conventional research agendas and pay closer atten­
tion to the various ways in which people are engaging with the past outside 
of academia (Rosenzweig and Thelen 1998; Paul 2015; Aurell 2018; Bevernage 
et al. 2019; Palmié and Stewart 2019). Sources ranging from tv series and nov­
els, to private recollections and re-​enactments, are no longer dismissed as 
watered-​down versions of history but valued as objects of study in their own 
right (De Groot 2015, 6; Landsberg 2015, 24). Various analytical concepts have 
been suggested to study such sources, each aimed at a particular aspect of 
the relationship between past and present. Some of these, such as ‘memory’ 
or ‘nostalgia’ are used in everyday conversation. Others, like ‘popular histor­
ymaking’ (Rosenzweig and Thelen 1998, 3), ‘historical consciousness’ (Seixas 
2004; Pihlainen 2014), or ‘presence’ (Bevernage 2016, 353) are of more recent 
coinage. Browsing this literature, each of these concepts and approaches made 
me reflect on particular aspects of Khoisan revivalism. Limiting myself to only 
some of them felt arbitrary.
Take ‘memory’ for instance, perhaps the most obvious choice for my 
research at first sight. After all, some define memory studies as a transdisci­
plinary field that investigates how, why, and when individual and collective 
pasts are constructed and contested (Kansteiner 2002, 180; Berliner 2005, 
200; Confino 2011, 41). The field’s findings that constructions of the past are 
dynamic, selective, and biased are directly relevant for my research (Nora 1989, 
8; Argenti and Schramm 2009, 2). However, to me, memory primarily refers 
to lived experiences, and Khoisan revivalists are also engaging with a past 
that extends centuries before their lifetimes (see also Poole 2008, 150). This 
does not disqualify memory studies all together out of a preoccupation with 
semantics. On the contrary, my point is rather that I cannot commit myself to 
a singular approach. With Wulf Kansteiner (2002, 181–​182), I see concepts such

as memory as but one of the many valid and overlapping approaches mak­
ing up the aforementioned research agenda looking into history beyond aca­
demia. Some authors have in response suggested more open-​ended concepts. 
Take for example Jorn Rüsen and his definition of ‘historical consciousness’ as 
the activity whereby the ‘past is interpreted for the sake of understanding the 
present and anticipating the future’ (Rüsen cited in Clark and Peck 2018, 2–​3). 
But this concept is in turn too wide in scope, making it difficult to work with 
as an analytical lens. Perhaps applicability in empirical research is one of the 
reasons why Herman Paul (2015) has called for the study of ‘relations to the 
past’, that is, the ways of ‘understanding, interpreting, or experiencing the past’ 
that differ from academic historiography. Rather than differentiating between 
different ‘relations’ to the past, however, I prefer Alison Landsberg’s (2015) less 
limiting phrasing, ‘engaging the past’, also because it denotes a more active 
process.
All the while, this type of research on everyday historical experiences sel­
dom makes use of anthropological methods (see e.g. Classen and Kansteiner 
2009, 1). John and Jean Comaroff’s (1992, 48) call for ‘an ethnography of the his­
torical imagination’ has not gained much traction. This is surprising since, as 
Stephan Palmié and Charles Stewart (2019, 2) remark in a recent volume: ‘How 
and why the past can and does become palpable in our present-​day experience 
is a genuinely anthropological question’. Grasping ‘how history is subjectively 
experienced’ is necessary to understand why it is ‘significant and often affec­
tively charged’. Such questions are at the core of what has been termed ‘the 
affective turn’ in history: ‘historical representation characterized by conjec­
tural interpretations of the past, the collapsing of temporalities and an empha­
sis on affect, individual experience and daily life rather than historical events, 
structures and processes’ (Agnew 2007, 299). As evidenced by the anecdotes 
involving the braai I shared earlier, it is indeed striking how engagements with 
the past by Khoisan revivalists are emotionally charged and commonly made 
in reference to the present. As I noted previously, I scrutinize these dynam­
ics by drawing on several concepts and strands of literature, some of which 
I introduce in Chapter 7. However, in the next section I need to single out the 
literature on ‘heritage’ as it stands out in this regard, plays an important role 
in the South African context, and chimes well with my conceptualization of 
indigenous revivalism and emic histories.

Heritage as a Process
Heritage eludes easy definition. Laurajane Smith (2006, 1), a leading author 
in the field of heritage studies, explains how ‘heritage’ is indeed all at once 
about the past, its material remains, and about how these are engaged with in

Introduction
the present. Nothing is heritage by virtue of its mere existence as a material or 
immaterial reference to the past. Rather, heritage is the process through which 
those references are engaged with and given meaning in the present (ibid., 1–​3). 
As a contemporary process, ‘heritageisation’ is more about the present than it 
is about the past and, with that, open to continuous selection, contestation, 
and redefinition by a multitude of actors (Harvey 2001, 320). Heritage can be 
used to contest and assert particular views of the past, as well as to bolster or 
discount identities (Smith 2006, 4). It is more often than not a site of strug­
gle, where contestations over representation, exclusion, and belonging tend 
to crystalize. This is certainly the case in post-​apartheid South Africa, where 
museums, tourist sites, and monuments that bear the marks of apartheid and 
colonialism are prime sites of contestation (McGregor and Schumaker 2006, 
649). The efforts of the African National Congress (anc)-​led government have 
thus come under fire for allegedly solely commemorating figures who deliv­
ered the country from apartheid and who embodied the spirit of reconciliation 
(Rassool 2000, 1; Marschall 2005, 78). This has been challenged in particular by 
various minorities, such as Khoisan revivalists, who feel left out in such nar­
ratives (Meskell 2011, 63). Yet others have argued that the decolonization of 
heritage does not proceed fast enough or probe as deep as it should. Perhaps 
the most recent example was the ‘Rhodes Must Fall’ protests that swept across 
the country’s campuses and beyond in 2015. Taking the removal of the statue of 
quintessential colonialist Cecil John Rhodes from the campus of the University 
of Cape Town as a rallying point, a wide range of grievances were voiced, from 
the lack of African perspectives in the curriculum to poor job prospects and 
the steep price of enrolment fees (Holmes and Loehwing 2016, 13; Oxlund 2016; 
see Conclusion).
While acknowledging that the boundaries between heritage and history are 
in practice often blurred, various scholars have commented on such develop­
ments by noting how the former is primarily about subjective interpretations 
of the past, thereby putting it in direct competition with the latter, where dis­
passionate critical enquiry and the reconstruction of past events is tradition­
ally at stake. Jean Comaroff (2005, 15) argued for instance that in South Africa 
‘history seems to have been disappearing in the academy in direct proportion 
to the degree to which it is being made elsewhere –​ as popular revolution, as 
media spectacle, as national pageant, as intellectual property, as recovered 
memory, as therapy’. For Ciraj Rassool (2000, 21), however, this did not nec­
essarily spell ‘the end of history’ but rather that ‘historians who have chosen 
to regard ‘heritage’ as an inferior domain have not understood the changed 
nature of their field’ since it was ‘the most important sphere in which contests 
over South African pasts have been taking place’. Echoing the abovementioned

debates about history outside of academia, he took issue with assumptions 
that academic historians held a monopoly over truth claims about the past and 
that those of others constituted at best primary source material, and at worst, 
a bundle of falsehoods and inaccuracies (ibid., 4). Rassool (ibid., 5; see also 
Witz, Minkley and Rasool 2017, 15) instead viewed both heritage and academic 
history as forms of ‘history-​making’ and called for the study of the differences 
in ‘categories, codes and conventions’ between them. Rassool is not alone in 
pleading for the study of heritage as a way of relating to the past in its own 
right. David Lowenthal’s work (1998, 2015) is widely accredited as one of the 
most in-​depth explorations of the topic (Gentry and Smith 2019, 1148). While 
Lowenthal (2015, 3) acknowledges his Eurocentric bias and that his impres­
sionistic writing style and eclectic source material might leave some readers 
wanting, I have found his observations to be highly valuable as an approach to 
the emic histories of Khoisan revivalists. Although it is true that he focuses on 
the potential of heritage to foment societal polarization, he does not simply 
dismiss heritage as a dangerous lesser form of history, as some of his critics 
claim (Gentry and Smith 2019, 1157). Like Smith, Lowenthal views heritage as a 
continuous process of engaging with the past to fulfil present needs and shape 
identities (Lowenthal 1994,43; 1998, 192). Heritage pursues different, yet equally 
important needs from ‘history’, but he warns that the two can at times be con­
flated in political settings –​ a subject I revisit at great length in Chapter 7.
What Lowenthal’s work does not do, however, is explain why certain ‘pasts’ 
are engaged with as heritage. As Smith (2006, 45) notes, ‘what exactly people 
‘do’ –​ subjectively and culturally –​ at heritage sites or with the concept of her­
itage itself, is as yet an under-​theorized issue in the literature’. She pleads in 
particular for more research on ‘the networks of meaning and practice’ that 
influence the relationship between heritage and identity under the banner of 
‘critical heritage studies’ (Smith 2006, 308; Gentry and Smith 2019, 1149). The 
bulk of Smith’s own research has drawn on critical discourse analysis to focus 
on how official national and international discourses on heritage constitute a 
‘authorised heritage discourse’ that defines what can and cannot be consid­
ered heritage. As I am interested in how and why Khoisan indigeneity is articu­
lated, I take inspiration from Smith to scrutinize a similar hegemonic discourse 
in my context, which I refer to as the Khoisan extinction discourse (see below). 
As I detail in Chapter 1, I apply this approach in concert with ethnographic 
methods, the potential of which for heritage studies has been recognized 
(Jones, Mozaffari, and Jasper 2017, 2). Ethnography not only accommodates 
my focus on the Khoisan revivalists themselves but also allows me to study the 
affective dimensions of their engagements with the past (i.e. ‘emic histories’) 
I mentioned earlier. In her most recent work, Smith and colleagues (Smith,

Introduction
Wetherell, and Campbell 2018, 10) have shown how emotions are central to 
heritage as a ‘practice of meaning-​making’ and how, in this process, individuals 
constantly ‘draw on a mix of past personal and cultural meanings to address 
their current circumstances and aspirations’ (Smith and Campbell 2017, 616). 
In line with my inspiration from articulation theory, it is this type of ‘mixing’ 
between past and present that I am interested in accounting for. In order to 
round out my analytical framework, with which I will undertake this enquiry, 
I need to relate these insights on heritage to the specific dynamics of indige­
nous revivalism.
4.2	
Indigenous Revivalism
If heritage is a process, then indigenous revivalism can be conceived of as a 
particular type of heritage-​as-​process. The context through which it unfolds, 
the motivations that guide it, and the various ways in which it expresses itself 
make it a distinct way of engaging with the past. I previously noted how there 
is a widespread belief that the Khoisan no longer exist as a distinct collective. 
Similar views about the supposed extinction of indigenous people elsewhere 
foreclosed the possibility of a vibrant indigenous presence, or indeed ‘revival’, 
until the global indigenous rights movement began to coalesce from the 1970s 
onward to challenge these notions (Soguk 2007, 15; Hill 2012b, 27). Prior to this 
development, academics did not really pay indigenous revivalism any mind. 
Two noteworthy exceptions are Ralph Linton and A. Irving Hallowell’s 1943 
paper on ‘nativistic movements’ and Anthony Wallace’s 1956 piece on ‘revital­
ization movements’. While these texts are outdated, some of their arguments 
were remarkably ahead of their time. Wallace (1956, 265) viewed ‘revitaliza­
tion’ as ‘a deliberate, organized, conscious effort by members of a society to 
construct a more satisfying culture’, and Linton and Hallowell (1943, 230–​232) 
observed that revivalism was a calculated response that involved a transforma­
tion of elements from the past to suit present needs, where ‘authenticity’ was 
of minor relevance. It is possible that these arguments were inspired by the 
anti-​colonial discourses of their time, such as Négritude, which rallied a wide 
range of anti-​racist poets, activists, and writers under its banner from the mid-​
1930s onward, most notably Léopold Senghor and Aimé Césaire. It was evident 
to these diaspora intellectuals that they would never be accepted as ‘French’ 
in the same way as their colonizers. Instead of further distancing themselves 
from their African heritage, the correct response was to take pride in it in order 
to cultivate a revolutionary historical ‘consciousness’ (Césaire 2000 [1950], 92). 
As Albert Memmi (2003 [1957], 135, 146, 149) argued, colonized people were 
alienated from their own past as it had been replaced by that of the colonizer 
through education programs. For Memmi (ibid., 168) and others, the turning

point in the anti-​colonial struggle was the rejection of assimilation, including 
the historical narrative it propagated. While the answers are found in the pre-​
colonial past, Césaire (2000 [1950], 52) warned that the aim of Négritude was 
not a fetishist repetition of the past but a creative return to origins (see also 
Nielsen 2013, 448).
As colonial legacies endure, so too have variations on the theme of Négritude. 
It shares with indigenous revivalism a rejection of assimilation and a concom­
itant embrace of roots (see e.g. Clifford 2013, 16; Coulthard 2014, 131). From an 
‘indigenous awakening’ in Latin America (Canessa 2018, 313), to the mobili­
zation of the Sámi in Northern Scandinavia (Nyseth and Pedersen 2014) and 
the ‘Maori Renaissance’ in New Zealand (Gagné 2013, 34), indigenous people 
around the world have indeed been seeking to address and resolve legacies of 
dispossession and assimilation along the lines of Négritude, at times explic­
itly (see e.g. Coulthard 2014). As is the case with Cape Town, assimilationist 
policies have alienated people from their indigenous ancestry in urban areas 
more than anywhere else. As the majority of indigenous people currently live 
in cities (Gagné 2013, 4; Watson 2014, 391; Peters and Andersen 2014, 1), this is 
also where most people take on a new identity as ‘indigenous’, giving rise to 
a growing demographic that has been referred to as ‘New Identifiers’ (Watt 
and Kowal 2019, 63) or ‘Reclaimers’ (Jacobs and Merolla 2017, 64). Ironically, 
whereas cities were once seen as antithetical to indigenous presence, they are 
now facilitating indigenous revivalism (Sissons 2005, 39; Liu 2014, 103). And 
yet, there is a lack of research on urban indigeneity (Nyseth and Pedersen 2014, 
133; Peters and Andersen 2014, 2) and newly identifying indigenous people 
(Culhane 2005, 297). As I will show, not only does the rural stereotype per­
severe in South Africa as it does elsewhere, the authenticity of urban indige­
nous identity is also disproportionally met with scepticism (Sissons 2005, 159; 
Gagné 2013, 39; Maddison 2013, 295).
The debate on ‘authenticity’, which I revisit at length in Chapter 7, tends 
to distract from the more relevant examination of what indigenous revival­
ism means as a socially significant process. In this regard, I am fond of Chris 
Andersen and Evelyn Peters’ (2014, 11) description of urban indigenous identi­
ties as ‘complex, highly vernacular engines of Indigenous cultural power’. In cit­
ies, indigeneity all at once ‘survives, adapts, and innovates’ (ibid., 2). Indigenous 
revivalism is indeed not about reconstructing the past as it was once but about

Rappaport and Tavuzzi 1998, 179; Coburn 2016, 298). The debate over whether 
or not this constitutes ‘genuine’ or ‘spurious’ heritage has ceased to be one for 
decades at this point (Handler and Linnekin 1984, 287–​288). Researchers have

Introduction
long realized that, as with heritage, identities and traditions are continuously 
adapted (Linnekin 1983, 241; Handler and Linnekin 1984). As Thomas Spear 
(2003, 4) noted in his critique of the literature on the invention of tradition, 
‘traditions’ are never invented out of thin air but are always adaptations and 
manipulations of historical precedents. In this sense, there is nothing distinc­
tive about the articulation of indigenous identity in indigenous revivalism. 
Indeed, unlike others, I do not argue that there is something necessarily ‘indig­
enous’ about the ways in which my interlocutors engage with the past (see e.g. 
Rappaport and Tavuzzi 1998; Borofsky 2000; Clifford 2013, 28).
I would put it differently: there is something unique about the historical 
and contemporary context in which Khoisan revivalism unfolds, which in turn 
engenders specific emic histories. As Steven Robins pointed out (see above), 
the fragmentation caused by colonialism partially accounts for the fact that 
indigenous identities are articulated through ‘entangled, compromised, unex­
pected histories’ (Clifford 2013, 183). Conversely, as Jonathan Friedman (2002, 
30) remarked, if identities are couched in the language of essentialism, then 
this should be approached as a ‘social phenomenon rather than shunned as 
a terrible mistake’. Maximilian Forte (2005, 27, 32), who conceptualizes indig­
enous revivalism at the crossroads of ‘total absence and seamless continuity’, 
argues in this regard that the ‘reengineering of indigeneity’ cannot be reduced 
to the political and economic contexts in which it is embedded. The point here 
is not merely that strategic essentialism is encouraged by a specific type of 
politics but that there is more to essentialism than politics. All essentialisms 
are also not ‘fake’. As Stuart Hall (1990, 224) reminds us, the powerful feeling 
of having rediscovered a previously lost or suppressed ‘essential identity’ or 
‘hidden history’ should not be taken for granted. My fieldwork showed that 
there is indeed something emotionally appealing and comforting in an essen­
tialist view of Khoisan indigeneity, whether mobilized in a political context 
or not. This brings to mind Avril Bell’s (2014a, 122) suggestion to avoid looking 
at indigenous revivalism solely through the prism of strategic essentialism or 
resistance, as doing so misses the ‘positive politics of recovery’ that underpins 
it –​ another notion I develop at great length in Chapter 7. As Taiaiake Alfred 
and Jeff Corntassel (2005, 611) explain, indigenous revivalism begins with 
individuals defining their own indigeneity and then using this self-​definition 
to engage in ‘everyday acts of resurgence’ in the world around them. ‘Being 
indigenous’ is therefore ultimately about ‘thinking, speaking and acting’ in 
accordance with one’s own articulation of indigeneity, whether in mundane or 
politically charged contexts (ibid., 614). In the next section, I detail how I will 
examine both the mundane and the political across several chapters in order 
to bolster my interpretation of Cape Town-​based Khoisan revivalism.

Research Questions and Outline
I began this introduction by illustrating how Khoisan revivalism is a growing 
multifaceted phenomenon in post-​apartheid South Africa. I proceeded to 
position myself in the literature and carve out an analytical framework that 
is best suited to study its driving forces and diverse expressions. I framed indi­
geneity as a specific mode of identification, an individually and contextually-​
depended articulation, shaped by both Khoisan revivalists and others. Crucial 
here is appreciating that the past is engaged with in the present in a setting 
of indigenous revivalism, which I described as a specific context of heritage-​
making where emic histories are central. I do not scrutinize whether Khoisan 
revivalist articulations of indigeneity are ‘authentic’ or ‘accurate’, but why 
and how this notion is shaped in the present, primarily by Khoisan revival­
ists themselves. My main research question is therefore rather broad: how and 
why do Khoisan revivalists engage with the past? I have split this up into three 
interrelated lines of inquiry:
	–​	 What are the historical and intellectual roots of Khoisan revivalism?
	–​	 Why and how do Khoisan revivalists make historical events, practices, and 
figures relevant for the present and how are these emic histories embedded 
in diverging articulations of indigeneity?
	–​	 What does Khoisan revivalism entail for contemporary debates on the poli­
tics of indigeneity in a South African context?
I have already mentioned at various points that ethnography is my weapon of 
choice to grapple with these research questions, but I provide more detail on 
my methodological approach in Chapter 1. Since arriving in Cape Town in 2014 
I have essentially looked for any expression of Khoisan revivalism. I scanned 
social and print media for Khoisan revivalists I could contact as well as to find 
relevant events and sources. I stuck with ethnographic methods throughout 
my research, amounting to a total of more or less one and half years’ worth 
of fieldwork (July 2014-​January 2015; July 2017-​October 2017; February 2018-​
July 2018; June 2019-​August 2019). In this chapter, I also review the delineation 
of my field site, the limitations of my approach, my positionality, the various 
methods I deployed, and the types of data I drew on to sustain my arguments 
and foreground emic perspectives. I have built up a considerable network of 
interlocutors over the years, which results in heaps of data, consisting mainly 
of interviews, observations, grey literature, newspaper articles, and social 
media posts. My fieldwork approach brought me to universities, libraries, and 
government buildings, but most of all to the aforementioned Cape Flats, where 
the majority of my interlocutors live and work. Across Greater Cape Town 
I attended book launches, protests, poetry recitals, and everything in-​between.

Introduction
In general, it is these kinds of materials that form the empirical grounds for my 
arguments.
After detailing my methodology, the two chapters that make up Part 1, Lost 
in Categorization? The Khoisan extinction discourse and the intellectual roots 
and aspirations of Khoisan revivalism, address the first research question and 
broach the third one by contextualizing the historical roots and political aspi­
rations of Khoisan revivalism. In Chapter 2, instead of providing a history of 
the Khoisan as a people, I focus on the historical trajectories of the ideas that 
have shaped, and continue to shape, (re)thinking about the Khoisan, from 
the early colonial encounters to the beginnings of Khoisan revivalism in the 
late 1990s. Inspired by the work of various scholars who have produced sim­
ilar insights (Adhikari 2011, 21; Besten 2011a, 69, 77; Ellis 2012, 2, 10; Schramm 
2016, 134; Parkington, Morris, and De Prada-​Samper 2019, 739, Øvernes 2019, 
152–​193), I refer to this set of ideas and stereotypes as the ‘Khoisan extinction 
discourse’, as its most enduring and shared notion is that the Khoisan have 
ceased to be a distinct collective. The roots of Khoisan revivalism are located 
not only among those that began to reject this hypothesis in academic circles 
but also among certain avant-​gardists in society at large. In Chapter 3, I go on 
to detail the trajectory of Khoisan revivalism in the post-​apartheid era by dis­
cussing watershed events, legislative developments, and key actors that have 
impacted it. Particularly relevant here are the engagements between the state 
and Khoisan revivalists regarding land restitution and traditional leadership. 
The chapter concludes with the observation that Khoisan revivalism is turn­
ing into a broad-​based identity movement. The overview more or less ends 
chronologically with the signing into law of the Traditional and Khoi-​San 
Leadership Act in 2019.
In Part 2, Ethnographic encounters with Khoisan revivalism in Cape Town, 
I present my fieldwork data across three chapters and continue addressing the 
third research question but focus in particular on the second one. Rather than 
working with a series of in-​depth case-​studies, I arrange my data according 
to fieldwork-​induced themes and observations. In Chapter 4 and Chapter 5, 
I discuss what I call the ‘Khoisan identity discourse’, that is, how my interloc­
utors speak about their Khoisan identity and indigeneity, and what it means 
to them. I tackle how this identity discourse relates to the aforementioned 
Khoisan extinction discourse in Chapter 7. Despite there being great diver­
sity, during my fieldwork I observed how Khoisan revivalists share elements 
of this discourse to varying degrees when identifying with or as Khoisan. In 
Chapter 4, I explain how the rejection of Coloured identity is linked to the 
notion of an ‘identity crisis’, which is in turn judged to cause the social ills in 
Coloured communities and which can only be remedied through a cathartic

(spiritual/​religious) embrace of Khoisan identity. As I show with the help of 
several examples, this identification is accompanied by a particular interpreta­
tion of the Khoisan past, that is, emic histories that emphasize relatability and 
historical continuity between the Khoisan past and personal and collective 
experiences of being known as Coloured. As I show in Chapter 5, this identifi­
cation is also regularly accompanied by a series of entitlement claims, which 
can include claiming land and traditional leadership titles, but also relate to 
other forms of everyday empowerment. Crucially however, these have to be 
understood in relation to specific contestations over who is legible to claim 
Khoisan indigeneity and on what basis. In Chapter 6, I shift the emphasis away 
from what Khoisan revivalists say to what they do. Looking at Khoisan reviv­
alism in practice through a wide range of examples, I discerned two kinds of 
activities: those that seek to emulate the past as it is believed to have been 
at one point in time and those that strive to revive Khoisan culture via the 
explicit introduction of novel elements, all the while acknowledging that this 
distinction is primarily analytical, as Khoisan revivalism, just like any other 
culture, in practice always adapts (see above).
I provide my theoretical analysis of all this empirical material and my cen­
tral research question in the sole chapter of Part 3, Theoretical perspectives 
on Khoisan revivalism. Due to the recurrent emphasis on ‘healing’ in Khoisan 
revivalism, I critically draw on several authors –​ Ronald Niezen (2009) in par­
ticular –​ to focus on emic history’s ascribed ‘therapeutic’ qualities and how this 
reflects Khoisan revivalists’ views of what constitutes an ‘authentic’ engage­
ment with the Khoisan past. While certainly not all of their engagements with 
the past fit this pattern, I argue that Khoisan revivalists’ emic histories have a 
tendency to take on particular characteristics (e.g. emphasizing historical con­
tinuity, romanticizing or focusing on specific time-​periods or events) as they 
need to first and foremost counteract histories of dispossession and assimila­
tion and serve present needs. Defining authenticity as a subjective interpreta­
tion of the ‘essence’ of the past with the help of Laura Saxton (2020), I further 
posit that what is authentic in this setting is a result of in-​group validation. 
The resulting articulation of indigeniety takes on ‘subversive’ qualities in that 
content, source, and medium are all not bound to a colonial legacy of what is 
regarded as ‘accurate’ or appropriate. Khoisan revivalists, at one and the same 
time, replicate, disregard, and appropriate these legacies as embodied in the 
Khoisan extinction discourse. To be sure, this type of ‘subversive authenticity’ 
in engaging with the past poses a range of important conundrums, particularly 
when it forms the basis for entitlement claims.
In the Conclusion I provide a summary of my main arguments and tease 
out the limitations of my research, which in turn allows me to formulate

suggestions for future research. I also reflect on the societal, intellectual, and 
political implications of how we view and study Khoisan revivalism, and 
revisit my third research question a final time. I do this in reference not only to 
recent developments regarding land reform in South Africa but also by expli­
cating the various reasons for why I chose ‘Khoisan Consciousness’ as the title 
of this book.

­chapter 1
Defining a Phenomenon, Navigating a Field
Studying Khoisan Revivalism through Reflexive Ethnography
Research is […] a trans-​directional revolving door or turnstile, 
marked by ironies, manifold negotiations, elasticity, zigzagging, 
disruptions, reflections, interventions, interferences, suspicions, 
friendships, enmities, disinterest, weeks of inactivity follow by days 
of feverish activity, and zones of instability where actors are always 
entering and exiting, exiting and entering […] That is, where we 
work, the process is always already the product.
nyasha mboti (2012, 63).
∵
Nyasha Mboti’s description ought to resonate with anyone who is familiar with 
fieldwork. His turnstile metaphor captures that characteristic fieldwork-​feel­
ing that everything is constantly shifting and increasingly perplexing. From 
the moment I set foot in Cape Town, this research has felt like the exploration 
of a never-​ending maze of identity politics, the past and the present, notions 
of (in)authenticity, townships, government meeting rooms, international 
concepts and their local appropriations, and much, much more. Like Mboti, 
I recall as many moments of lucidity and confidence, as episodes when I felt 
lost at sea. The complexities of social reality make fieldwork demanding and 
messy but for those same reasons creative and rewarding. I could share various 
anecdotes to that effect, but in and of themselves such reflections are superflu­
ous. Rather, following Mboti, I pay closer attention in this chapter to how ‘the 
process was already the product’, to how I manoeuvred, for better and worse, 
through my ‘maze’, and what this entails for my arguments about Khoisan 
revivalism. This is not a triumphalist narrative of how I ultimately conquered 
my challenges and ended up with the most relevant sources and methods. This 
would be of little use to anyone, least of all those seeking to do similar field­
work. Rather, ‘methodology’ involves examining how and why methods were 
selected and applied in practice (Carter 2018, 397), particularly in a context of 
fieldwork, where ‘the experiencing body and reflective consciousness of the

Chapter 1
anthropologist becomes the crucial scientific instrument’ (Kapferer 2007, 82; 
see below).
As much of my argumentation relies on my own interpretations, it is imper­
ative that I elucidate my positionality and role as a fieldworker and the choices 
that I made in this capacity, an exercise known as ‘reflexivity’, a core value of 
anthropological research since the 1980s (Salzman 2002). Reflexivity is pre­
mised on the notion that no aspect of research is self-​evident. According to 
Mats Alvesson and Kaj Sköldberg (2009, 8, 9), this requires researchers to be 
permanently aware of the ‘complex relationship between processes of knowl­
edge production and the various linguistic, social, political, and theoretical 
contexts of such processes, as well as the involvement of the knowledge pro­
ducer’. Others similarly define reflexivity as a ‘turning back on oneself’ (Davies 
1999, 4), a ‘continual internal dialogue’ (Berger 2015, 220), or a process of ‘con­
stant awareness, assessment, and reassessment’ (Salzman 2002, 806). The aim 
is to contemplate the influence, for better or worse, of personal and contextual 
(subconscious) biases on the research process and outcomes, from the gather­
ing and interpretation of data, to the political aspects of the study and the eth­
ics of authorship (Alvesson and Sköldberg 2009: 11; Berger 2015, 221). It is not a 
matter of ticking boxes on a list of issues to be mindful of, such as ‘biography’, 
‘ethics’, or the suitability of certain ‘methods’. Although no aspect is off limits, 
reflexivity is productive in so far as it speaks to the specifics of the research(er) 
at hand (Berger 2015, 220). By their very nature, not all biases can be detected 
by the author, or by others for that matter; neither is reflexivity meant to be an 
exculpatory ‘audit trail’ that mimics the experimental procedures of the exact 
sciences to bolster scientific credibility (Hammersley 2010, 29; Bell 2014b, 519; 
Lichterman 2017, 35). Rather, reflexivity invites readers to be on the lookout for 
aspects that seemingly went unnoticed, yet significantly impacted the research. 
This does not necessarily make arguments more convincing but certainly more 
transparent and open to contestation (Kapferer 2007, 82; Lichterman 2017, 35, 
38). Ultimately, reflexivity strives towards what Alvesson and Sköldberg (2009, 
222) called an ‘open text’, where the distance between reader, researcher, and 
researched is minimized.
Reflexivity is therefore hopefully apparent throughout the book, but this 
chapter in particular contributes to this effort by scrutinizing how, when, 
and why I made choices that meaningfully impacted my research. I begin by 
explaining in the first subchapter why ethnography was my primary means of 
data collection. I define ethnography as a distinct analytical mind-​set focused 
on interpreting emic perspectives, rather than a set of methods. In the second 
subchapter, I detail how I gathered data in practice. Throughout this discus­
sion of sources and methods, I expand on relevant aspects of research ethics

and positionality. I also explain how my fieldwork was characterized by a pro­
ductive tension between my research questions and fieldwork-​induced defini­
tions of Khoisan revivalism. Since fieldwork forms the empirical basis for my 
arguments, this realization constitutes a vital caveat.
1.1	
Ethnography and the Interpretation of Emic Perspectives
As I recounted in the introduction, for over six years (at the time of writing) 
I have been trying to understand what drives Khoisan revivalism. More than 
anything else, I remain interested in the perspectives and experiences of the 
Khoisan revivalists themselves. What are called emic perspectives (as opposed 
to the ‘etic’ perspectives from others) are central in qualitative enquiry across 
several disciplines, but they are arguably particularly so in anthropological 
investigations (Snape and Spencer 2003, 3–​4; Kapferer 2007, 81). It is therefore 
not surprising that I found ethnography alluring. I do not want to get side-​
tracked here by detailing the supposed boundaries between ethnography and 
‘anthropology’, ‘fieldwork’ or ‘qualitative research’ (see e.g. Denzin and Lincoln 
2017, 46–​47), but I will focus instead on what they have in common. Many have 
suggested in this spirit that ethnography is a mode of verbal description, an 
analytical mind-​set, rather than a distinct set of methods, and that it prefers 
bottom-​up perspectives over top-​down theoretical ones (Hammersley and 
Atkinson 2007, 230; Krzyżanowski 2011, 232; Ingold 2017, 88). Ethnography 
engages with the theoretical depending on its ability to yield valuable expla­
nations of the empirical, not the other way around (Kapferer 2007, 81; Schiller, 
Reyna, and Eckert 2016, 136). I too am primarily intent on understanding the 
phenomenon of Khoisan revivalism in Cape Town and engaging with theoret­
ical concepts in that order –​ a point I elaborate on below.
Empirically-​based ‘thick descriptions’, as Clifford Geertz (1973, 7) called 
them, are favoured in ethnographic research because they describe not so 
much external factors (i.e. ‘thin descriptions’) but the ‘[thick] layers of mean­
ing and symbolism that characterize human action and social phenomena’ 
(Alvesson and Sköldberg 2009, 130). Thick descriptions are bound to emic per­
spectives; they speak to anthropologists’ desire to understand how people per­
ceive of, and act in, the world around them (Carter 2018, 398). As Geertz (1988, 
16) put it, ethnographers want ‘[t]‌o discover who people think they are, what 
they think they are doing, and to what end they think they are doing it’. To this 
end ethnography requires a certain degree of open-​mindedness and cultural 
relativism (Hammersley and Atkinson 2007, 230). John and Jean Comaroff 
(2003, 164, 166) argued that ethnography begins by seeing and listening, and

Chapter 1
appreciating the ‘polyphony of perceptions, valuations, means and ends’ that 
make up social reality. Ethnographers avoid viewing things primarily through a 
lens of preconceptions and theories. The practice in fact encourages theoreti­
cal eclecticism and exposing the contingency of theories and models (Kapferer 
2007, 88; Hammersley 2019, 579). This chimes well with my take on indigeneity. 
As Dorothy Hodgson (2011, 215–​216) learned from her study of Maasai iden­
tity in Tanzania, ethnography allows researchers to go beyond legal debates 
about the term and pay closer attention to how and why people themselves are 
engaging with indigeneity in everyday practices and discourses.
From theories to biases, as the classic dictum goes, ethnography is about 
‘making the familiar strange, and the strange familiar’ (cf. Ybema and Kamsteeg 
2009). For Geertz (1973, 20), making the strange familiar entails ‘guessing at 
meanings, assessing the guesses, and drawing explanatory conclusions from 
the better guesses’. Making those educated guesses does not require ‘becom­
ing’ our interlocutors by ‘going native’, but rather obtaining ‘a working familiar­
ity with the frames of meaning within which [people] enact their lives’ (Geertz 
2001, 16). Fieldwork is all about establishing this ‘working familiarity’, hence 
the premium placed on ‘detailed observation and prolonged first-​hand experi­
ence’ (Ingold 2017, 69) or ‘close-​up, on-​the-​ground observation of people and 
institutions in real time and space’ (Wacquant 2003, 5) in definitions of eth­
nography. Since each ‘field’ is unique, there is no single guide on how to carry 
out ethnographic fieldwork. Martyn Hammersley (2010, 36) suggested that 
ethnography is therefore less a matter of following procedures than it is a craft 
based on situated decision-​making. All the while, he distinguishes several fea­
tures of fieldwork that resonate with my own experience, particularly the need 
for an improvised mode of data collection (Hammersley and Atkinson 2007, 
3; see below). I concur that the analysis is ultimately enriched by the wealth 
of the empirical material as a result of having ‘been there’ in the field, rather 
than the meticulous application of specific methods (Geertz 1988, 3–​4). The 
added value of ‘being there’ is not always evident when put into words, which 
is in turn occasionally cited in order to diminish ethnography as ‘unscientific’ 
and anecdotal (Hammersley 2013, 1). This, however, misunderstands what 
ethnography aims for. Rather than laying claim to objectivity, ethnography is 
ultimately a reflexive ‘exercise in miscommunication’, inescapably confined 
to the specifics of the research, the researcher, and the researched (Benzecry 
2017, 26). Fieldwork is ‘undisciplined’ and elastic in the sense that it in facts 
demands the reinvention of research methods and theoretical models in line 
with local contexts and personal experiences; it is not a replicable experiment 
(Hazan and Hertog 2012, 1). A lot depends on luck and unforeseen encounters 
and findings (Rivoal and Salazar 2013, 178). The intricacies of doing fieldwork

and interpreting data led Tim Ingold (2019) to conclude that it is more of an art 
than a science. Others too have found ethnography to be more impressionistic 
than explanatory in its ability to comment on the social world (Hammersley 
2010, 29–​30).
Ethnography is not an exact science, but it does not give licence to pure fab­
rication. Rather, as Claudio Benzecry (2017, 32) put it, one needs to realize that 
‘[w]‌hat is going on –​ regardless of our questions and theoretical perspectives –​ 
is not docile but resists our attempts to make sense of it, harden it into data, 
and make it into a fact’. As much as this impacted my definition and arguments 
on Khoisan revivalism (see below), it indeed does not disqualify the whole eth­
nographic endeavour. This observation rather prompts researchers to pay close 
attention to how they gather and interpret data. It is common to distinguish 
two methods in particular in this regard: interviewing and observation (Ingold 
2017, 69, Davies 1999, 67). As the next section bears testament to, these cer­
tainly describe the most common activities of my fieldwork. However, ethnog­
raphy ultimately involves gathering and utilizing whatever data sheds light on 
the issues under scrutiny (see also Denzin and Lincoln 2017, 46). This, at least 
in my case, not out of a commitment to ‘triangulation’, that is, the validation or 
legitimation of findings by using several methods and sources (Fielding 2012, 
124), but because emic perspectives are found in various shapes and sizes. As 
a result, Hammersley and Paul Atkinson (2007, 3, 121) urge ethnographers to 
also take documentation and material objects under their purview: ‘[M]any 
of the social settings we study are self-​documenting, in the sense that their 
members are engaged in the production and circulation of various kinds of 
written material’. As will become apparent, Khoisan revivalism is definitely 
self-​documenting.
Whether or not looking at these types of sources means that I carried 
out discourse analysis is a moot point, ultimately dependent on how ‘dis­
course’ is defined. Like ethnography, ‘discourse analysis’ is an umbrella term 
(Hammersley 2005, 2). Traditionally, it refers to the examination of ‘lan­
guage as text’, for instance through detailed scrutiny of interview transcripts 
(Krzyżanowski 2011, 231, Hammersley 2005, 3). ‘Critical discourse analysis’, 
however, began examining discourses contextually, as ‘language in the world’ 
(Atkinson, Okada and Talmy 2011, 87). In this tradition, discourses refer to 
regimes of power that attempt to implicitly or explicitly regulate what can 
and cannot be said, represented, and known about a subject, institution, or 
social activity (Ashcroft 2013, 83). It is contested how much discourses exercise 
power and influence the behaviour of actors, as well as the other way around 
(Smith 2006, 14, 15). Studying discourses therefore requires an interdisciplinary 
approach and it is not hard to see how ethnographic data are indeed highly

relevant here (Bucholtz 2001, 181; Hammersley 2005, 7–​8; Atkinson, Okada, and

One of my concerns is after all analysing how Khoisan revivalists make sense 
of their realities by contesting and drawing on a ‘Khoisan extinction discourse’. 
However, in keeping with my take on ethnography, I reiterate that it is not so 
much the distinct methods and sources as such that have defined my research 
as it is my engagement with them in practice. To make this point more con­
crete, I now scrutinize my research practice in closer, reflexive detail.
1.2	
Gathering Data on an Elusive Phenomenon: Heterogeneous 
Interlocutors, Reflexive Methods, and Eclectic Sources
That I would carry out ethnography was one of the few things I knew for cer­
tain when I left for Cape Town to conduct my first stint of fieldwork, which 
lasted from July 2014 to January 2015. Little did I know at the time that I would 
return on multiple occasions, amounting to roughly one and a half years 
spent in the field (July 2017 –​ October 2017, February 2018 –​ July 2018, June 
2019 –​ August 2019). As I noted in the Introduction, when I arrived in Cape 
Town, I had not foreseen staying there for my fieldwork but instead came 
across Khoisan activists in the city somewhat by coincidence. In my ma the­
sis, I describe how I established my first contacts in the field, which in turn 
caused me to abandon my rather naïve assumptions about Khoisan revival­
ism (Verbuyst 2015, 10–​11). In essence, I had expected to engage with neatly 
bounded communities who were trying to reclaim specific plots of land. What 
I witnessed instead turned out to be fascinatingly more complex, a complex­
ity that I am still trying to unravel. I remain uncertain about what Khoisan 
revivalism ‘is’ and whether I have the right type and amount of data to sustain 
my arguments and generalizations. The ‘field’ is primarily an analytical con­
struction of the researcher. As Darryl Stellmach (2020, 3) explains, not only 
is fieldwork contingent on a particular moment in space and time, it is also 
willed into being by the researcher when speaking and writing about it. When 
I asked my interlocutors to reflect on Khoisan identity, I possibly encouraged 
them to make connections that they otherwise might not have made (see 
below). To some extent, my definition of Khoisan revivalism is undoubtedly 
informed by such feedback loops. Yet, as Stellmach (ibid., 4) goes on to argue, 
this is precisely what characterizes the fieldwork process; it constitutes the 
researcher as much as the researcher constitutes it. Fieldwork experiences 
are not invalid because of this. Rather, they need to be put under detailed 
scrutiny with this dynamic in mind.

If anything, my research attempted to define and understand the undeni­
able revival of Khoisan identity in Cape Town and beyond. Is it a stretch to 
argue that observations relevant to Khoisan revivalism can be gleaned from 
this? In no way am I suggesting that this book is flawless or provides all the 
answers when it comes to Khoisan revivalism. On the contrary, I actively try 
to explicate my limitations and nuance any generalizations. Considering 
where I might have failed is not to rationalize ‘mistakes’ after the facts. 
Contemplating failures, revisions, and challenges is rather part and parcel of 
ethnographic fieldwork as it generates potentially revealing insights about the 
subject of the research itself (Cramer et al. 2016, 159). Various commentators 
have remarked in this regard that fieldworkers ought to be wary of feeling 
that they have collected sufficient data or devised a satisfying interpretation 
of what they observed in the field (Hammersley and Atkinson 2007, 90–​91). 
Recall here the aforementioned directive to make the familiar strange and the 
strange familiar. For Anna Tsing, proper fieldwork entails constantly adapting 
research questions and reengineering methods to fit local settings (cited in 
Trundle 2018, 94). Much of it is figured out along the way and the result of 
continuous fine-​tuning (Hammersley and Atkinson 2007, 4). More often than 
not, this means abandoning at least some of the goals and approaches set out 
in the initial research proposal (Hammersley and Atkinson 2007, 160). During 
my research I was continuously tempted to settle on a definition of Khoisan 
revivalism, only to be quickly frustrated by its inevitable limitations. As I came 
across new data that challenged my analytical deductions, I went back to the 
drawing board. This in turn pushed me to look for data that would fit my new 
mould. Ethnography is indeed ‘a delicate engagement of the inductive with 
the deductive’; a perpetual back-​and-​forth between data gathering and anal­
ysis (Comaroff and Comaroff 2003, 172; see also Rivoal and Salazar 2013, 180; 
Hammersley and Atkinson 2007, 235). Charlotte Davies (1999, 193) argued that 
analysis means ‘intellectual distancing from the minutiae of ethnographic 
observations’, but not too much, since going too far could render it ‘irrelevant 
to the lived experiences of people on the ground and neither grounded in nor 
answerable to ethnographic data’. Ethnography strikes a delicate creative bal­
ance between several tensions inherent to the discipline (Hammersley and 
Atkinson 2007, 230). I already partly explained in the introduction how grap­
pling with these tensions made me end up with a rather open-​ended definition 
of Khoisan revivalism, which I reproduce here for ease of reference:
The increasing affinity towards, and politicization of, the Khoisan in post-​
apartheid South Africa, deriving mostly from a critical interrogation of 
the identity label Coloured, especially among those currently classified

as such, whereby some (re)claim Khoisan identities, indigenous status 
and/​or land and leadership titles.
In line with the abovementioned understanding of fieldwork and ethnogra­
phy, this definition makes peace with the ultimately elusive nature of Khoisan 
revivalism. More importantly, however, it is my way of straddling the particu­
lar and the general, a classic conundrum for ethnographers (Hammersley and 
Atkinson 2007, 233). There is a kind of fealty to the specific features of the 
local context that is studied, which, it is often argued, are at risk of being lost 
when theories are brought to bear on them. Yet, the same ethnographic data 
are bound to be the basis for at least some type of generalizing claim, whether 
explicitly theoretical or not. Having said that, the emphasis is usually on the 
particular and my research is no exception (Davies 1999, 93). My arguments are 
not necessarily representative of Khoisan revivalism as whole. Casting the net 
wide comes at a price. My definition clearly speaks to a wide variety of activi­
ties, too many for a single monograph to fully take into consideration.1 In fact, 
as Part 2 will attest, Khoisan revivalism is branching out into ever more spheres 
of society, redefining itself in the process. Parts of this text might not age well 
as a result. And yet, I retain that through my study of the particular, I speak to 
Khoisan revivalism as whole. Much of this effort hinges on the careful con­
sideration of which type of data can be used to make claims about Khoisan 
revivalism in general and which is too specific to do so. Ultimately, the degree 
to which readers will be convinced of my claims depends on which arguments 
I make, based on which interpretation of which sources, that is, the content of 
the following chapters. In the remainder of this chapter, I look more closely at 
the process of data gathering itself. I begin by examining why I worked with 
particular sources during fieldwork and beyond, and what consequences flow 
from this selection. I then close with some reflections on the implications of 
my examination and interpretation of these sources.
1.2.1	
Sources
My open-​ended definition of Khoisan revivalism is the result of, and results in, 
working with eclectic sources and heterogeneous interlocutors. This approach 
expands on the network of Khoisan activists I established during my ma 
research. Two organizations are worth mentioning as I have continued inter­
acting with them ever since: the Institute for the Restoration of Aborigines of

South Africa (irasa) and the National Khoisan Council (nkc), mainly through 
its Western Cape representative, Chantal Revell. Particularly in my PhD 
research, however, I engaged with Khoisan revivalists with loose or no affilia­
tions to groups or organizations. Others have posited that Khoisan revivalism 
is not so much a ‘movement’ made up of several organizations but ‘a profusion 
of groups and individuals with a variety of agendas who have claimed Khoisan 
identity’ (Adhikari 2005, 177). I prefer speaking of a phenomenon since, to me, 
a collective or movement implies a degree of communality or organization 
which might be hard to pinpoint. While I am reluctant to clarify which kind 
of ‘phenomenon’ Khoisan revivalism is, I do reflect at greater length on some 
of its defining features in Chapter 7. I did however constantly look for a mod­
icum of communality while scouting for anyone who was overtly busy with 
Khoisan issues. This type of unstructured observation is common for ethno­
graphic research in general, particularly during the early stages (DeWalt and 
DeWalt 2011, 10, 34). To increase my sample of Khoisan revivalists, I asked those 
whom I already engaged with to put me in touch with others (referred to as 
snowball sampling) and I scanned various forms of offline and online media 
for Khoisan-​related events that I could attend or people whom I could contact.
Taking a wide focus meant that I quickly gave up on my attempt to get a 
complete overview of all the actors who were busy with Khoisan revivalism 
in Cape Town. I cannot begin to estimate how many Khoisan revivalists there 
are in the city: an assessment that was also abandoned by Chizuko Sato (2018, 
200), who carried out similar fieldwork. Even if I were to make my definition 
more precise, such an attempt would likely remain futile. Not everyone who 
could be considered a Khoisan revivalist overtly self-​identifies as such or joins 
a Khoisan-​related organization (Sato 2018, 202, 206; Øvernes 2019, 11; see also 
Forte 2005, 15; Paradies 2006, 363). I ultimately defined people as Khoisan 
revivalists in my capacity as a researcher. Khoisan revivalism can be as subtle 
as a form of everyday identification; it does not need to be broadcasted far 
and wide for it to be deeply meaningful. Some organizations and individu­
als regularly feature in the media, but many frequently do so with different 
names or titles, or disappear from the public stage seemingly from one day 
to the next. I was confused on more than one occasion to witness Khoisan 
revivalists, ostensibly recently ushered into the fold, take centre stage at 
events, official or otherwise, never to do so thereafter. Khoisan revivalism 
consists of a plethora of ‘chiefs’ and groups in flux who reach varying degrees 
of prominence (see Chapter 5). Contacting people was therefore not always 
easy. Websites are frequently not updated, and pages on social media tend 
to become inactive quickly (cf. Sato 2018, 202). This is not to say that social 
or print/​digital media were not useful. I made extensive use of pmg.org.za,

Chapter 1
the website of the Parliamentary Monitoring Group (or pmg), an organiza­
tion set up in 1995 to record public deliberations in the South African parlia­
ment, to find and keep up with political debates on Khoisan issues. Websites 
of the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (cogta.
gov.za) and the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (drdlr.
gov.za) were similarly helpful. I also kept an eye on the main South African 
newspapers for relevant news, but I did not carry out an in-​depth analysis of 
the media-​reception of Khoisan revivalism as this falls outside the scope of 
this book.
I did meticulously scan 24 issues of Eerste Nasie Nuus (hereafter enn), an 
activist newspaper distributed all over South Africa (enn 2017a, 2) and set up 
by prominent Khoisan revivalists Zenzile Khoisan and Debbie Hendriks in July 
2013. In their words:
enn is the media voice of the Khoi and Boesman Indigenous conscious­
ness resurgence in South Africa. We carry public interest news and analy­
sis directly related to the on-​going fight for indigenous status recognition, 
specialised heritage and history articles, writing on symbols and cultural 
practice and special pages dedicated to the revival of the ancient Khoi 
and Boesman languages.
enn 2013a, 1
There are plans to make enn available online, but for now only a limited 
amount of printed copies exist. I did not manage to get a hold of all of them 
as there is no clear outlet selling them. I received some from Zenzile Khoisan 
and others were donated to me by other generous Khoisan revivalists. While 
it appeared monthly for a while, it often came out whenever an issue was 
ready. What makes this source so invaluable is the fact that it mostly consists 
of emic perspectives of Khoisan revivalists. This also allowed me to identify 
various potential interlocutors. Moreover, while explicitly activist in orienta­
tion, enn frequently invites opposing parties to share their views. It was not 
always clear who authored a specific contribution. Sometimes authors were 
mentioned, sometimes not. For consistency’s sake, I therefore only mention 
page and date when referencing entries in enn. enn is in many ways the suc­
cessor of a similar newspaper called Eland Nuus, where Zenzile Khoisan and 
Debbie Hendriks were also contributors. Eland Nuus was set up by Desmond 
Sampson in 2009 and had a strong focus on Khoisan issues as well, though not 
as exclusively as enn. I am grateful to Sampson for sharing several copies. I will 
come back to these newspapers in subsequent chapters. For the sake of com­
pletion, I also mention grey literature as a valuable source under this rubric

(i.e. documentation produced by my interlocutors, such as history books or 
political pamphlets), the details of which I discuss as I draw on them.
Social media plays an ambiguous role in my research. As with news media, 
I did not focus on social media’s role in Khoisan revivalism or set out to do a 
detailed analysis of it as a source (see e.g. Postill and Pink 2012; Mare 2017). 
Rather, when I began looking into Khoisan revivalism I made use of social 
media to contact Khoisan revivalists individually, and collectively as groups, 
mainly through Facebook and WhatsApp, which remain the most used plat­
forms (cf. Sato 2018, 202).2 As I got accepted into public and private chat 
groups, I noticed how interesting opinions and images were circulating there. 
Other ethnographers too have picked up on peculiar dynamics between online 
and offline selves, something I come back to in Chapter 7. I certainly did not 
enter these groups or make connections on social media with people with the 
intent of using their content. Doing so without getting explicit informed con­
sent would be unethical. One could argue that where it is publicly available, it 
is part of the public domain. Moreover, I could have disclosed my presence in 
the group as a researcher –​ which I did not do explicitly but would have done 
should anyone have asked –​ but then I would have had to do this on every 
occasion when a new user joined. With some groups consisting of hundreds 
of members, this is not a realistic option. My explicit presence as a researcher 
would also potentially impact the nature of the discussions taking place. 
I never posted anything myself as I was more interested in observing what was 
happening. In the case of WhatsApp chat groups in particular, I was always 
admitted by someone who knew who I was and what my research was about. 
In these respects, social media might constitute a grey zone when it comes 
to research ethics (Mare 2017, 659). Yet, it is more correct to err on the side of 
caution. If I found a particular post or image interesting, I contacted the user in 
question to ask for consent to use the data. If this was unsuccessful, then I did 
not use the material. I also gave everyone the option to remain anonymous if 
they so wished, either by removing their name from the post or altering what 
they said in a way that would make it difficult to trace quotes back to specific 
people (see below).
Informed consent is an opportune segue into a discussion of my network­
ing among Khoisan revivalists at large. Every time I met a potential inter­
locutor, I introduced myself and disclosed my research intentions. I did so 
briefly and in my own words, but always mentioned how I would (not) use

Chapter 1
any potential information from our encounter. I only recorded interviews 
after being given explicit informed consent, which I captured in my audio 
recordings. I did not work with written informed consent forms. Rather 
than consisting of one singular act (e.g. the signing of a form), consent and 
research ethics were negotiated at every step of the way (Gillan and Pickerill 
2012; Bell 2014b, 519; Riese 2019, 677).3 Ethical aspects of the research needed 
to be reflected on beforehand but even more so attuned to the social cues 
of the fieldwork encounter. Consent forms could for instance misleadingly 
imply that every aspect of research ethics that was applicable to the specific 
encounter at hand was covered by signing a piece of paper. A signed form 
generates a legalistic –​ and in my opinion ironically so, predatory –​ atmo­
sphere over what is at heart more of a social encounter. Much in the field is 
unpredictable and occurs in grey zones ethically speaking (Sampson 2019, 
142; see above). Fieldwork is shot through with multi-​directional collabora­
tions, complicities, and collusions (Trundle 2018, 107). It would be naïve to 
assume that interlocutors have no agency in this regard. I am not only talking 
here about requests for monetary compensation, which only occurred twice 
and which I politely refused since I found it awkward to haggle over price 
and put pressure on our exchange as a result. I tried to be sensitive to the 
fact that I took up people’s valuable time. I always left it entirely up to my 
interlocutors on when, where, and for how long to meet. I often gave them a 
ride with my car, as many did not have one at their disposal. I always offered 
to pay for a meal, which felt more organic than a cash transfer. Moreover, 
various interlocutors also understood that, by having a car, attending various 
events, and meeting with several people, I could be useful to them. I fre­
quently offered lifts or shared public information with them (see below). In 
that sense, being an ‘insider’ and ‘outsider’ is relative depending on the spe­
cific facet of a research setting.
It is also for these reasons that I, like many others, prefer to speak of facil­
itators rather than gatekeepers, which refers to explicit guardians of spe­
cific information who need to be negotiated with in order to obtain access 
(Hammersley and Atkinson 2007, 49). The point is not that such people did 
not feature but that the transactional nature of such engagements does not 
reflect my own experiences. Like consent, ‘access’ was negotiated through­
out the research process and affected more than specific sets of information 
(Riese 2019, 671, 674). Facilitators facilitated the degree to which the research

as a whole could be carried out, not least by putting me in touch with poten­
tial interlocutors or inviting me to attend certain events. As I already men­
tioned in the Introduction, the fact that I am a Caucasian European clearly 
had an impact. I often had the impression that I was perceived as a neutral 
observer of events, someone ‘from the outside looking in’ without a horse in 
the race. This reputation benefited me when approaching individuals and 
groups who were at odds with one another. Some even commended me for 
doing so, judging my efforts to contribute to the often mentioned need for 
unity among Khoisan revivalists (see Chapter 3). I come back to the issue 
of reciprocity in the next section. I wonder, however, in what ways my field­
work would have been different had I been a White, Black, or Coloured South 
African. I sense that being a White South African, which I was seldom mis­
taken for as far as I can tell, would have probably made people more combat­
ive towards my presence, as they and their historical predecessors are often 
blamed for their current predicaments. Being Belgian and European gave me 
a ‘pass’ in this regard. To most, geographical distance seems to have made 
up for historical complicity. While the history of settler colonialism in South 
Africa is more complex, most of the people I engaged with tied the early colo­
nialism in South Africa principally to the Dutch. The fact that I understood 
Afrikaans as a Flemish native speaker was not directly linked to the history of 
colonialism, but seen as a curiosity, which in turn functioned as an excellent 
conversation starter (see below). Black South Africans might have had more 
trouble with some individuals because of racial tensions between Coloureds 
and Blacks (see Chapter 5). Lastly, being Coloured would have perhaps made 
me more privy to private conversations and events but also more frequently 
called upon to assist and support Khoisan revivalism through my research, 
potentially compromising my ability to write critically.
I come back here to the role of facilitators, as it cannot be underesti­
mated how much they impacted my research. They certainly opened doors 
for me, but they also indirectly made me blind to other possibilities. Davies 
(1999, 79) stresses in this regard that it is vital to interrogate why certain peo­
ple become central in our research, especially when they were instrumental 
in creating a network of other interlocutors. Coming back to my open-​ended 
definition of Khoisan revivalism with this in mind, I was biased to overt forms 
of Khoisan revivalism and interlocutors that embodied the kind of Khoisan 
revivalism I was looking for. That frequently meant people who have the time, 
passion, and means to do so. In practice, these were often, though not always, 
intellectuals or political leaders who were explicitly and visibly promoting 
Khoisan revivalism. For all these reasons, my network consists mostly of overtly 
political Khoisan revivalists. I regularly tried to look for interlocutors for whom

Chapter 1
I suspected Khoisan revivalism might mean something different.4 Despite 
(failed) attempts at diversifying, I undoubtedly remained stuck in certain echo 
chambers or social circles, and my observations are inescapably informed by 
the Khoisan revivalists I ended up interacting with the most (see also Gagné 
2013, 16). While I engaged with individuals and sources at the expense of oth­
ers, I maintain that my research generated insights into Khoisan revivalism 
as a whole. Before moving on to the next chapter and beginning to make this 
case in more concrete terms, I need to address how these insights were gleaned 
from the interpretation of certain data, gathered through the application of 
specific methods.
1.2.2	
Methods and Wider Implications of the Research
Observation is perhaps the method that is most commonly associated with 
ethnography and fieldwork, yet at the same time the most ambiguous. Why, 
how, when, and what does one exactly observe? There is no shortage of lit­
erature on this subject. The method dates back to the formative years of the 
anthropological discipline and traditionally refers to the process of observing 
and participating in the daily lives of people over a considerable period of time 
in order to gain a better understanding of their ways of being (Kawulich 2005, 
3, 26). The potential of observation lies with its ability to translate these sen­
sory –​ but in practice mostly visual –​ experiences of shared realities into rich 
detailed descriptions of the people and contexts that are studied (Kawulich 
2005, 2). Note here how this echoes what I wrote concerning ethnographic 
fieldwork and gaining a working familiarity with local contexts. In line with my 
take on methods in general, I see observation in terms of both intent and prac­
tice as highly dependent on the peculiarities of the field at a given moment 
in time. In my case, looking for Khoisan revivalism meant that I spent time 
with people that I identified as Khoisan revivalists and attended events that 
were billed by interlocutors or others as dealing with Khoisan issues. Though 
not exclusively, I mostly spent time with interlocutors in such settings. In that 
sense, I did not exactly observe ‘everyday life’. My fieldwork was confined to 
Cape Town most of the time, but I made a couple of excursions to other parts 
of the country when there were interesting links to, and influences on the city’s 
	4	 These conversations also assisted in identifying blind spots. The most notable lacuna being 
the religious/​spiritual dimensions of Khoisan revivalism. While I address this topic in 
Chapter 4, in hindsight I realized that I underestimated its importance in articulations of 
indigeneity. This might be because I had not envisioned that it would play such a prominent 
role in my research early on, and/​or because I am not familiar enough with many of the ref­
erences that are made in such contexts to fully appreciate their importance.

Khoisan revivalist scene. As I already alluded to in the Introduction, I attended 
various types of events, from meetings with government officials to cultural 
functions and screenings of documentaries. Most of these took place across 
the Cape Flats, where the bulk of my interlocutors live, or at locations of sym­
bolic significance in the Central Business District of Cape Town.
At these events I tried to spot and record things that embodied Khoisan 
revivalism, such as distinct dress codes or materials linked to Khoisan culture. 
Despite actively paying attention, observation is mostly a matter of always 
being on the lookout for research-​relevant material with an open mind, rather 
than attempting to be a fly on the wall in order to get an all-​encompassing 
view of what is going on (Kawulich 2005, 2). The latter is untenable no mat­
ter how much researchers might try to distance themselves, both physically 
or mentally. They always ‘participate’ at least to some extent, if only by being 
physically present, and this inescapably impacts the research (see above). 
Degrees of observing and participating are interesting to think about in the 
abstract, but they quickly become blurred in the field, at least in my experience 
(Kawulich 2005; DeWalt and DeWalt 2011, 34). For that matter, participating 
does not necessarily insure higher quality observations, but it does influence 
data collection (Davies 1999, 73). I have already spoken in this regard about my 
presence as a Caucasian European. I often stuck out because of this. I certainly 
did not hide my identity as a researcher, but I did not take notes on a notepad 
since I felt this to be somewhat intrusive and distracting (DeWalt and DeWalt 
2011, 161). If I did feel I had to jot something down, I used my smartphone; 
behaviour which hardly raises any heads these days. I made more comprehen­
sive notes when the event concluded and I was back home. Depending on the 
size of the event and whether or not people were aware that I was there in the 
capacity as a researcher, I felt at times as if interlocutors deliberately engaged 
in ‘ethnographic self-​fashioning’ (Wicomb 1998, 92) by exaggerating markers 
of indigeneity in order to convince me of their cultural authenticity. In antici­
pation of upcoming events, I was often told by interlocutors that I would get to 
see and experience ‘real culture’. I come back to where this need to emphasize 
authenticity comes from in Chapter 7. I raise the issue here to acknowledge 
that it impacted my data collection.
A similar kind of dynamic undoubtedly occurred during interviews. While 
I also used interviews to reconstruct events that I could not observe myself, 
rendering interviewees ‘surrogate researchers’ who could provide me with 
second-​hand information (Hammersley 2005, 9), I mostly asked people to 
reflect on what Khoisan revivalism meant to them or when they began identi­
fying as Khoisan. In this process, I explicitly made them front Khoisan-​related 
aspects of their lives, events which they otherwise might not have cast in these

terms. This turned the field into a type of ‘archive’ and even more so the other 
way around, as I relied on ethnographic fieldwork not just to reconstruct past 
events but also to study the way they are remembered and framed in the pres­
ent. If my interlocutors were at any point romanticizing or exaggerating, this 
did not make their accounts less relevant for my research; on the contrary, 
as I am primarily interested in emic perspectives (see also Field 2001, 118). 
Indeed, my interviews were not joint excavations of inner truths that would 
have remained hidden otherwise (Whitaker and Atkinson 2019, 621). Nor were 
they inroads into an authentic Khoisan revivalist experience. Interviews rather 
provoked a series of reflections on the part of the interviewee to shed light on 
their behaviour and thoughts, which might be difficult to achieve in other ways 
(Hammersley 2005, 9). While a specific type of conversation, ethnographic 
interviews are dialogues, which means that those reflections in practice occur 
in both parties. Meaning is not something that I extracted by asking the ‘right’ 
questions. It was negotiated in concert, depending in part on how much inter­
locutors were willing to share (Riese 2019, 670–​671; Perera 2020, 156). During 
interviews I tried to establish what Eduardo Viveiros de Castro (2013, 474–​475) 
has called ‘a relation of knowledge’, an atmosphere where it was clear that 
I approached interlocutors to learn about Khoisan identity, just as much as 
they might learn and theorize from our engagements. As I show, many Khoisan 
revivalists undertook activities that closely resemble ethnographic fieldwork, 
making this observation all the more relevant. I encouraged this type of co-​
construction of data and interpretation by frequently theorizing alongside 
my interlocutors, for instance by floating certain hypotheses or asking them 
at the end of every interview if they had any questions for me –​ a question 
that almost always courted interesting discussions about research ethics and 
the wider impact of my work, or lack thereof. I come back to this point shortly.
Despite encouraging co-​construction, I was the one most able to steer the 
conversations. Researchers need to acknowledge their responsibility in this 
regard. I for instance honed in on Khoisan revivalism at the expense of other 
equally or potentially more important aspects of people’s lives. In this way, 
I might have missed crucial cues that could help explain certain experiences 
or behaviours (see also Bobel 2007, 148). As the following chapters make clear, 
Khoisan identity does not stand alone: hence also my choice for articulations 
of indigeneity (see Introduction). Humans are complex beings and cannot be 
reduced to one aspect of their lives. I tried to be aware of this as much as possible 
during the writing by bouncing ideas off other academics or interlocutors. One 
of the ways in which I tried to minimize seeing everything through a Khoisan 
lens during my research was by starting interviews with biographical questions 
about background, upbringing, and professional history (see Arthur and Nazroo

2003, 113). When people responded to my questions by discussing things that 
seemingly had little to do with the Khoisan, this was in fact highly relevant as it 
was part of their making sense of events and experiences during that particular 
moment in time (Whitaker and Atkinson 2019, 622, 623). I always prepared a 
semi-​structured interview-​guide tailored to the individual I was speaking with, 
that is, a list of topics and questions I wanted to cover. I usually had this guide 
by my side to avoid missing out on the opportunity to ask questions that were 
particularly relevant for the person in question. In practice, however, I impro­
vised and frequently went off-​topic (see also Arthur and Nazroo 2003, 115–​116). 
Indeed, like many ethnographers, I avoided imposing too much structure on 
my interactions, and they tended to take a more informal character (see Davies 
1999, 94). The topics that we covered were at times quite intimate and struck 
at people’s core identities and beliefs. For this reason, I often ended up having 
multiple interviews with the same people.
An advantage in this regard is that I can understand Afrikaans, the mother 
tongue of most of my interlocutors, even if people almost always switched to 
English when they realized I could not speak it fluently. On some occasions, 
the fact that I knew a couple of words and phrases in Khoekhoegowab created 
rapport with interlocutors as this was welcomed as a small-​scale act of Khoisan 
revivalism (see Chapter 7). In an atmosphere where Khoisan identity is often 
ridiculed or doubted, some interlocutors told me it was refreshing, even ther­
apeutic, to have the opportunity to speak about it openly with a non-​Khoisan 
person. There is indeed more to ethnographic interviewing than questions and 
answers (Davies 1999, 95). I tried not be intrusive but to listen, to value their 
opinions, and not to judge, which is certainly something that encourages peo­
ple to open up (DeWalt and DeWalt 2011, 163). After all, if the person sitting 
across from you is perceived to be hostile, it makes little sense to share infor­
mation with them (Berger 2015, 220). At times Khoisan revivalists also used 
me as a sounding board for their ideas (see Riese 2019, 671; see above). I was 
happy to oblige or assist in other ways, but this does not absolve me of the 
responsibility of being the one who ultimately interpreted the data and subse­
quently wrote up the research. This inevitably resulted in at least some form of 
disagreement with some of the interlocutors.
As many have pointed out, there is certainly something awkward about 
deconstructing indigenous identities with sophisticated academic tools when 
those very identities form the basis of their struggles (see e.g. Robins 2001; see 
also Chapter 7). Conversely, as Adam Kuper (2003; see Introduction) and oth­
ers are correct in pointing out, researchers should also not accept and repro­
duce uncritically what they hear in the field (Gillan and Pickerill 2012, 138).

the post-​apartheid era, for example, some South African anthropologists have 
even intimated that such conundrums have led to an existential crisis in the 
discipline (Van Wyk 2013a, 71–​72; Cousins and Reynolds 2016, 11). According to 
Andrew Spiegel (2005, 136), their prime concern is whether or not exposé eth­
nography’s legacy of deconstructing ethnicity ‘is really what needs to come out 
of an ethical consciousness that is in tune with South Africa’s contemporary 
post-​apartheid situation and circumstances’. While I have already explained at 
length in the Introduction that I do not think that it is, the balance between so-​
called engaged research and critical assessment is not self-​evident (Hodgson 
2011, 13, 15; Geertz 1988, 10). As I stated before, ethical boards have their use at 
the beginning of the research, but the nitty-​gritty of research ethics depends 
on the specific dynamics of the field. To me, research encounters are ultimately 
asymmetrical in that they will always benefit me more directly than them (see 
also Geertz 2001, 33). No Khoisan revivalist was waiting for me to write this 
book, nor will it drastically change their lives. But whether or not it will have 
an impact is much more difficult to predict. While I had never thought any 
Khoisan revivalist would have been interested in my ma thesis, a handful of 
interlocutors did read it. As is the case with this book, it is open access5 and 
therefore freely available to anyone with an internet connection.
Linda Tuhiwai Smith (2012, 1) famously called for ‘decolonizing methodol­
ogies’ by validating and legitimating indigenous ways of knowing in order to 
break with centuries of abuse and exploitation at the hands of researchers. As 
I show in Chapter 2, South Africa certainly has a share in this history, not least 
when it comes to research on the San. However, the South African San Institute 
(sasi) made world news by putting out a guide for researchers in March 2017 
(Callaway 2017, 475). The guide clarifies that the San do not reject research 
out of hand but that they demand ‘respect’, a word that suffuses the text. They 
ask researchers to be mindful of various historical and cultural sensitivities, 
privacy issues, as well as the contributions of the San themselves (sasi 2017, 
2). The purpose of the research needs to be transparent, and it can only take 
place if sasi deems it to potentially improve the lives of the San (ibid., 2, 3). 
The guide is a response to the fact that the region it concerns itself with, the 
Kalahari Desert, has been ‘bombarded by researchers’ over the years, some of 
whom guilty of stealing traditional knowledge and making careers or build­
ing lucrative companies on its basis, with few benefits flowing back to the 
San (Callaway 2017, 475, sasi 2017, 3; see Chapter 3). The guide is not the only 
response to these practices (see e.g. Tomaselli 2012c and Ellis 2014, 20–​23), but

it has to be borne in mind that it speaks to an area that has a vastly different 
history of engagements with researchers than Cape Town, even if there is a 
general distrust towards academics and people speaking on their behalf there 
as well (see e.g. enn 2013e, 3).
I agree with the guide’s insistence on the need for respect, reciprocity, and for 
my research to try and be useful for Khoisan revivalists themselves. However, 
this brings me back to the urgent, imperative, but ultimately open question of 
how this is best accomplished. I made clear in the Introduction how I intend 
to break with most of the previous research that has been carried out about 
Khoisan revivalism, particularly studies that deconstruct Khoisan identity 
through an instrumentalist lens. This departure begins by taking Khoisan 
revivalism seriously as an intellectual and sociopolitical phenomenon. In what 
follows, I suggest an interpretation of what drives people to revive Khoisan 
identity, since I believe that such insights are painfully lacking in both the pub­
lic and academic discourse. My efforts are by no means perfect but strive to be 
a productive reference point in order to reflect on how Khoisan revivalism can 
be accommodated in the post-​apartheid era. Hopefully readers will judge my 
work in terms of moving towards realizing that ambition.

(Re)Thinking the ‘Khoisan’
The Fate of a People, the Career of a Concept
We are sick and tired of naked Brown people being exposed to the 
curious glances of rich whites in search of dinner table conversa­
tion. At the exhibition […] indignity was heaped upon indignity, 
culminating in the centrepiece –​ mounted casts of Brown breasts 
and penises. The people of whom these casts were made are long 
dead. They cannot tell of the humiliation suffered, or the pain they 
felt at being manipulated in this way. We can. As the descendants of 
the Khoisan […] we feel it daily and hourly […] The exhibition does 
nothing to oppose the forces which tried, and are still trying, to con­
quer the Khoisan. Instead it is yet another symbol of our status as 
a conquered people. Where is the Khoisan view of these manipula­
tions? Where are our representations of the people who came here 
to steal our land, make us slaves and deprive us of our culture and 
our history? […] We will only accept the good intentions of white 
liberals when they strip off their own clothes in public and take pic­
tures of themselves for a change.

‘There is no escape from the politics of our knowledge, but that politics is not 
in the past. That politics is in the present’. Greg Dening’s observation was dis­
played strategically at various points during the exhibition Miscast: Negotiating 
the Presence of the Bushmen, which opened in April 1996 at the South African 
National Gallery in Cape Town, and was curated by Pippa Skotnes, artist and 
lecturer at the University of Cape Town (Skotnes 2001, 314). As South Africa 
turned over a new page with the democratic transition of 1994, Skotnes felt 
she had to do her part in exposing and tackling the legacies of colonialism and 
apartheid. Drawing on her entanglement in this history as a White academic

exponent of Khoisan studies, Miscast sought to lay bare the various ways cen­
turies of representations of, and research on, the Khoisan left a record of abuse 
and complicity in manifold atrocities in its wake. The exhibition was Skotnes’ 
way of carrying out an exorcism on the discipline and facing her demons by 
confronting them head on. As a consequence, Miscast had a macabre and 
eerie feel to it. Among the various objects on display to implode the scien­
tific gaze were instruments that had been used to measure cranium size or 
genitalia, resin casts of bodies, pictures of naked prisoners chained by the 
neck, and stacks of boxes that had been used to transport and store human 
remains (Lane 1996, 7; Robins 2000, 56; Bregin 2001, 99). While photographs 
from Paul Weinberg showing the contemporary living conditions of Khoisan in 
the Northern Cape were put up as a way of presenting their ‘voice’, as Skotnes 
explains, the exhibition was not ‘about’ the Khoisan, but instead offered a ‘crit­
ical and visual exploration of the term ‘Bushman’ and the various relationships 
that gave rise to it’ (Skotnes 1996, 18).
Not everyone agreed either with this assessment of Miscast or with the man­
ner in which Skotnes attempted to realize her stated ambitions. Even more sig­
nificant than the ensuing discussions among academics was the unprecedented 
degree to which Khoisan themselves exercised their agency in such debates 
(Lane 1996, 9; Bregin 2001, 100, Davison 2001, 6; Skotnes 2001, 317). A case in 
point is the statement by the !Hurikamma Cultural Movement, authored pri­
marily by Yvette Abrahams, a key figure in Khoisan revivalism (see below). In 
her characteristically outspoken style, Abrahams charged Skotnes with (un)
wittingly perpetuating the very type of behaviour Miscast took to task. This 
occured, her argument goes, by taking it upon herself as a White academic to 
exhibit and exploit violence and nudity. While some Khoisan actually praised 
Skotnes for not shying away from the graphic aspects of this history (Skotnes 
2001, 317; Bregin 2001, 100), others deplored her stylistic choices. Particularly 
controversial was the fact that visitors were made to walk over pictures of 
Khoisan (and images related to their representation) that had been turned 
into tiles in most of the rooms making up the exhibition. Though acknowl­
edging this is as Skotnes’ way of rendering visitors uncomfortable with, and 
complicit in, the subjugation of the Khoisan, this was considered offensive by 
some Khoisan as they had to trample on the pictures all the same (Douglas 
and Law 1997, 84–​85). Skotnes’ ‘exhibit about exhibits’ clearly did not resonate 
well with those for whom the ironies of deconstruction were deemed out of 
place (Douglas and Law 1997, 104; Jackson and Robins 1999, 89). While she had 
communicated previously with certain Khoisan communities in the Northern 
Cape in anticipation of such feedback, Skotnes (2001, 315) had not expected 
her exhibition to cause such emotional distress. Dening’s words were perhaps

(Re)Thinking the ‘Khoisan’

more prescient than Skotnes had foreseen: the politics of knowledge certainly 
did not lie in the past, nor would there be any easy escape from them.
As the events surrounding Miscast evidenced, not only were Khoisan descen­
dants not speaking with one voice, their numbers had been vastly underes­
timated by Skotnes. About 700 people attended the public forum about the 
exhibition organized the day after the official opening, among whom dele­
gates representing over 11 Khoisan groups from various corners of the country 
(Bregin 2001, 100). Besides the type of interventions concerning Miscast that 
I just mentioned, the forum also functioned as a platform to articulate (com­
peting) political aspirations. The Khoisan representative from the Northern 
Cape who gave the opening speech at the exhibition did not reference Miscast 
once, instead capitalizing on his moment in the limelight to plead for greater 
protection of economic and cultural rights for the Khoisan (Klopper 2011, 37). 
At the forum, Mansell Upham, ‘the mandated legal representative of the Griqua 
National Conference’, faulted Skotnes for not addressing political issues of rec­
ognition, particularly as they relate to the Griqua (Lane 1996, 9; see below). 
For Skotnes (2001, 317), the forum showed how Miscast had become a rallying 
point for both Khoisan unity and disunity. Disagreement arose over who quali­
fied as authentically Khoisan and on what basis, particularly between the sup­
posedly westernized Griqua and traditionalist San, with arguments revolving 
around the impact of Europe-​derived Afrikaans as the mother tongue of most 
Coloureds, and the need for traditional clothing (Jackson and Robins 1999, 
87; Skotnes 2001, 317). The complexity surrounding Khoisan representation 
was embodied by a group of Khoisan who worked at the tourist village Kagga 
Kamma, located a couple of hours’ drive from Cape Town, where visitors can 
interact with ‘the near extinct Bushmen’ (White 1995, 11). Clad in animal skins 
and personifying the romanticized narrative of Kagga Kamma on the steps of 
the National Gallery, the delegation’s strategic essentialism contrasted starkly 
with the deconstructionist critique of Khoisan representation offered in the 
exhibit behind them (Douglas and Law 1997, 102; Jackson and Robins 1999, 95).
Miscast and its fallout indeed revolved around a maelstrom of controver­
sial issues connected to the question of who had the right to represent the 
Khoisan and in what manner. With the opening up of the public space after 
the end of apartheid, the stage was set for such debates to proliferate, and as 
this book attests to, they certainly have. As the late Michael Wessels (2014, 465, 
470) pointed out, together with a special issue on Khoisan representation in 
1995, Miscast was a conduit in the ongoing self-​reflexive turn in Khoisan stud­
ies. Ironically, as it turned inward, Khoisan studies began paying more mind 
to dynamics outside of academia. Miscast showed how the issues academics 
increasingly concerned themselves with were directly relevant to the political

aspirations of a vocal demographic who Skotnes and many others had hereto 
not accounted for. As Skotnes (2001, 319) learned to her surprise, Miscast cre­
ated an awareness among Khoisan descendants and others of their Khoisan 
lineage (Bregin 2001, 101). In fact, the ‘Khoisan Identities and Cultural Heritage 
Conference’ took place only a year later, which I view as the starting point of 
post-​apartheid Khoisan revivalism proper. Where did these initial Khoisan 
revivalists come from? Who were they and how did they organize themselves? 
What did they want and what did they campaign against? Such questions need 
to be explored in order to fully appreciate Miscast as a watershed moment in 
the history of Khoisan revivalism.
I provide answers in this chapter and the next, which together make up 
Part 1, Lost in Categorization? The Khoisan extinction discourse and the intel­
lectual roots and aspirations of Khoisan revivalism. The aim of this chapter is 
to historicize the operation and contestation of what I, inspired by the work 
of various other scholars (Adhikari 2011, 21; Besten 2011a, 69, 77; Ellis 2012, 2, 
10; Schramm 2016, 134; Parkington, Morris, and De Prada-​Samper 2019, 739, 
Øvernes 2019, 152–​193), will call the ‘Khoisan extinction discourse’ in reference 
to the commonplace belief that the Khoisan have ceased being a distinct col­
lective as a result of their decimation and dispossession by colonial aggressors, 
and their assimilation as Coloureds through a protracted process of bureau­
cratic erasure.
A couple of caveats are vital here. A meaningful distinction can be made in 
this regard between the ‘hunter-​gatherer’ San and the ‘pastoral’ Khoikhoi (see 
Introduction). Debates are ongoing about (the lack of) differences in economic 
activity, descent, language, and culture between them (Elphick and Malherbe 
1989, 5; Smith 1990, 11; Wright 1996; Smith 1998; Du Plessis 2019). As I will show, 
colonialists frequently differentiated between San and Khoikhoi based on 
perceived differences in ways of life, at times with deadly consequences. As 
Robert Ross (cited in Bredekamp 1991, 70) points out, however, ‘the distinction 
[between Khoikhoi and San] is meaningless […] when the history of their sup­
pression comes to be written’. I agree for reasons that will become apparent 
and therefore in the main stick with ‘Khoisan’. I also do not solely reference 
Khoisan history as it relates to Cape Town and its direct environs but draw on 
relevant episodes from South African history in general to make broader points 
concerning the plight of the Khoisan and the development of ideas about 
them. The further one goes back in time, the fewer the sources authored by the 
Khoisan themselves (Penn 2005, 4; Hamilton, Mbenga and Ross 2010, 1, 9). Yet 
it is precisely the resulting Eurocentric bias that I am interested in showing in 
this chapter. With these caveats in mind, I take my cue here from Alan Barnard 
(2007, ix), who calls for studying the diverse interpretations of ‘Khoisan’ (he

specifically speaks of ‘Bushmen’) as ‘an image that remains in anthropological 
consciousness, although transformed through history’.
Studying the diversity of Khoisan representation through the prism of the 
Khoisan extinction discourse yields original interpretations of South African 
history, but this does not mean that all of the relevant history neatly exem­
plifies this discourse. Neither have ideas about the Khoisan remained static 
across centuries. I also do not suggest that resistance to colonialism only 
took place in the form of Khoisan revivalism or that the Khoisan had no prior 
influence on, or say in, how they were represented or represented themselves, 
as I make clear with plenty of examples.1 The point of this chapter is rather 
that Khoisan revivalism is historically significant in the manner in which it 
publicly and assertively leads the Khoisan themselves to engage with the 
Khoisan extinction discourse –​ a point I come back to at length in Chapter 7. 
To make this case for agency compelling, I distil the predominant ideas that 
have shaped, and continue to shape, (re)thinking about the Khoisan. The first 
subchapter provides an overview of colonialism and apartheid and their var­
ied impact on the Khoisan extinction discourse. For the sake of convenience, 
I split the discussion into three parts, respectively covering more or less the 
periods of Dutch colonialism, British colonialism, and apartheid. Surveying 
such vast stretches of time necessitates a broad-​brush approach. Moreover, 
my focus is on the career of ‘Khoisan’ (and its many historical precedents) as 
a top-​down concept rather than on the fate of the people it sought to define. 
The following subchapter takes off from the anti-​apartheid struggle of the 
1970s and shifts the emphasis towards Khoisan agency. I hone in on the role of 
the Khoisan revisionist historiography that was written from this time onward 
as I believe it functioned as a precursor to post-​apartheid Cape Town-​based 
Khoisan revivalism through its (in)direct contestation of the Khoisan extinc­
tion discourse. A pivotal figure in this regard is Henry Bredekamp, who was 
instrumental in organizing the aforementioned ground-​breaking Khoisan 
Identities and Cultural Heritage Conference in 1997, where I pick up the dis­
cussion in Chapter 3. Before getting there, however, I need to back up roughly 
half a millennium, and confront the problem of Khoisan representation at its 
inception.
	1	 It is worth mentioning in this regard that Robert Ross (2017b) recently bundled together a 
selection of political texts authored by (or supposedly verbatim reproductions of) ‘Cape 
Khoesan’ between 1777 and 1879, particularly originating from the Kat River Settlement (see 
below).

Chapter 2
2.1	
Dispossession, Assimilation, and the ‘Vanishing Native’: A Brief 
Overview of Khoisan History
2.1.1	
Dutch Colonialism Settles on South African Shores: Frontier Settlers 
and Expendable Natives (1652–​1806)
As Khoisan revivalists frequently point out, South African history does not 
begin in 1652, the year Jan van Riebeeck arrived as the first commander of 
the Dutch colony. The presence of the Khoisan in Southern Africa, which 
stretched roughly from the Cape of Good Hope to Northern Namibia in the 
North, and to the Fish River in the East (see Figure 3), certainly predates that 
of the settlers by several centuries. The history of Khoisan representation by 
Europeans also does not start with Van Riebeeck. Ideas and images about 
the local inhabitants of the Cape were forged long before. The oldest known 
encounter between Europeans and Khoisan took place during the 1487–​1488 
expedition of Bartolomeo Diaz, under whose command three Portuguese sail­
ing ships rounded the Cape of Good Hope in an attempt to reach India. As they 
sailed around the Cape, the Portuguese and the Khoisan were cautiously try­
ing to figure one another out (Raven-​Hart 1967, 1–​7). Initial impressions from 
the Portuguese side were not particularly negative and they engaged in small-​
scale trade with the local Khoisan. Things turned violent as the Portuguese 
attempted to take fresh water from a watering hole in present-​day Mossel Bay, 
a couple of hours’ drive from Cape Town. Diaz himself reportedly fired his 
crossbow at the Khoisan who were chasing them away, resulting in the first 
recorded murder of a Khoisan at the hands of a European. As Diaz and his 
crew continued their voyage the next day, they noted how ‘ten or twelve blacks’ 
tore down the cross and padrão (a type of signpost) they had erected on the 
land. Similar events occurred roughly twenty years later, in March 1510, when 
another Portuguese commander, Francisco D’Almeida, attempted to make use 
of local resources. In the culmination of an unclear series of events, possibly 
involving the attempted abduction of a Khoisan child, the Portuguese were 
defeated in battle by a group of ‘bestial negroes’ on the shores of Table Bay, 
with D’Almeida perishing in the process (Johnson 2011, 10–​34). This episode 
gave the inhabitants of the Cape a notorious reputation and effectively warded 
off settlers for another 150 years.
Traders kept calling at the Cape, however, particularly during the 17th 
century. Its favourable location and climate made it a natural pit stop on the 
passage to the East. The local Khoisan traded livestock for metal objects and 
other wares Europeans had on offer. The Dutch and English even took the 
Khoisan leaders Coree and Autshumato, some say forceably, to Batavia and 
London respectively to make them acquainted with the local languages and

economic systems, and to subsequently set them up as trading agents at the 
Cape (Worden, Van Heyningen and Bickford-​Smith 1998, 12, 14). Ships came 
and went, and barter trade flourished for decades. Descriptions of the Khoisan 
during this time were not exactly flattering, with Europeans taking offense at 
their supposed hedonistic lifestyle and incomprehensible click-​languages. But 
these types of observations were few and superficial. There was little interest in 
describing or commenting on Khoisan ways of life during this time (cf. Raven-​
Hart 1967). This changed drastically after the Dutch East India Company, or 
Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (voc), decided to erect a permanently 
inhabited structure on the shores of Table Bay in 1652. The rationale behind 
the outpost was that it would facilitate trade with the Khoisan –​ who were 
during this time often referred to using the terms Hottentotten, Kafirs, or 
Bosjesmannen, who many today regard as deeply offensive (Ardnt 2018, 66). 
A permanent post would also make it easier to provide visiting ships with fresh 
water and produce. While the voc was certainly in it for the long haul, there 
was no directive to colonize or dispossess the local population from the onset. 
Van Riebeeck took care to maintain cordial relations with the Khoisan in the 
initial years following the fort’s establishment. Large scale conflict would have 
been too expensive and unlikely to succeed as the Khoisan wholly outnum­
bered them (Elphick 1977, 97).

Chapter 2
As long as it kept its distance and a relatively low profile, the Khoisan seem 
to have viewed the voc as an opportune trading partner and potential ally 
in intertribal conflicts (Worden, Van Heyningen, and Bickford-​Smith 1998, 14). 
However, the establishment, fortification, and expansion of the fort put them 
at risk of no longer being able to access crucial fresh water sources and graz­
ing areas that were part of their traditional migration routes (Elphick 1977, 75; 
Guelke 2003, 93). This cut-​off became a reality for the Khoisan in the aftermath 
of a resolution that was passed on 16 May 1656, which allowed the voc to lease 
tracts of land on the banks of the Liesbeeck river to nine ex-​employees, who 
in turn committed to selling their produce back to the company. This type of 
settlement was increasingly encouraged in order to accommodate the growing 
demand for meat, which exceeded what the Khoisan could or wanted to pro­
vide (Elphick and Malherbe 1989, 11; Ross 2017a, 187–​188). When Van Riebeeck 
planted an almond hedge in 1657 to prevent Khoisan from entering his newly 
demarcated territory, violent retaliation loomed (Bredekamp and Netwon-​
King 1984: 10; Worden, Van Heyningen, and Bickford-​Smith 1998, 25). Estimates 
put the figure of Khoisan in the South-​Western Cape at the time at around 
50,000, but they did not operate as a uniform force (Elphick and Malherbe 
1989, 3). Some argue that leadership was lineage based (ibid., 6), others that 
it depended on the number of livestock someone possessed (Ross 2014, 16). 
There is consensus however that the more powerful tribes extracted tribute 
from the weaker ones, which often led to breakaway groups. The voc readily 
manipulated such divisions to pit tribes against one another, and some collab­
orated with them (Elphick 1977, 53–​55). As the Khoisan were defeated in the 
ensuing wars (1659, 1673–​1677), they were chased from the territories they tra­
ditionally occupied and deprived of their livestock (ibid., 92). In a 1672 treaty, 
two Khoisan chiefs sold a massive tract of land to the voc, from Table Bay 
to Saldanha Bay in the North, to the Hottentots Hollands mountains in the 
East, for close to nothing (Bredekamp 1980). Their defeat was compounded 
by a series of smallpox epidemics, which continued into the first half of the 
18th century and wreaked havoc among the Khoisan, although their impact is 
disputed. Subjugated and dispossessed, Khoisan leaders were at first co-​opted 
as ‘captains’, but eventually totally side-​lined, with no independent tribes in 
existence south of the Orange River by the end of the 17th century (Bredekamp 
and Netwon-​King 1984, 15–​35).2
	2	 Robert Ross (2014, 16) argues that Khoisan leadership was linked to livestock rather than the 
possession of land. Hence the amaXhosa, among whom leadership is lineage-​based, could 
survive the onslaught of colonialism to a greater degree than the Khoisan.

(Re)Thinking the ‘Khoisan’
65
The voc consolidated its power in the region and an expanding settler 
frontier materialized, which eventually engulfed the whole of South Africa 
(Penn 2005, 27). By the end of the 18th century, the population at the Cape 
had risen from 250 in 1679 to 15,500 (Elphick 1977, 222–​223). While the colonial 
government continuously sought to regulate the rapid expansion of settlers 
into the interior, in practice the further from Cape Town, the more what were 
known as trekboers constituted the sole authority regarding how much terri­
tory they seized and how they treated the Khoisan (Adhikari 2011, 18, 29, 34). 
As Nigel Penn (2005, 1) put it, confronted with a violent and land hungry group 
of settlers, the Khoisan had three options available to them: retreat,3 submit, 
or perish. I would replace the latter with resistance, as this better captures 
what occurred well into the 19th century (see e.g. Viljoen 2006 or Elbourne 
2003). Settlers would often be attacked through guerrilla style raids that also 
aimed to (re)capture cattle and sheep (Ross 1979, 69). This in turn provoked an 
extremely violent counteraction from the settlers, which Mohammed Adhikari 
(2011, 12) has persuasively argued amounts to genocide, as in the willful inten­
tion to prevent a group from reproducing itself both biologically and culturally. 
The presence of the Khoisan ran counter to the colonial project: they were lit­
erally in the way of settler expansion and hence ultimately expendable in the 
eyes of settlers. To defend seized lands, the colonial government allowed, and 
at times officially sanctioned, settlers to form ‘commandos’, groups of armed 
men who patrolled an area, arrested or killed intruders, but who also carried 
out punitive expeditions into enemy territory (Adhikari 2011, 39; McDonald 
2016b, 925). Once again, while the colonial authorities sought to regulate the 
excesses of the commando system, the settlers in effect acted with impunity 
(Adhikari 2011, 57).
Such destructive and predatory behaviour found inspiration and legitima­
tion in then-​prevailing notions concerning the Khoisan. In what is a common 
settler fantasy, the land was imagined as virgin territory, terra nullius, largely 
void of people and awaiting cultivation in order to be turned into a settler’s 
paradise (Veracini 2007; Boisen 2017). The Khoisan frequently moved in 
search of good pastures and left few physical traces of their presence behind 
(Guelke 2003, 91). They likely stuck to a system of rotational grazing and 
shared resources (Elphick and Malherbe 1989, 12). Settlers either did not care 
for such local understandings of settlement and land use, or deemed them to 
	3	 This movement northwards or eastwards could entail adopting a hunter-​gatherer lifestyle in 
areas of less appeal to settlers or, in the case of the East, seeking the protection/​suzerainty of 
the amaXhosa or assimilating into their ranks –​ a bidirectional process that had already been 
underway as soon as the amaXhosa encountered Khoisan groups (Ross 2017b, xvii).

be rendered invalid as a result of conquest and the signing over of territories 
(Bredekamp 1982, 62; Worden, Van Heyningen, and Bickford-​Smith 1998, 24). 
Dispossession was further justified on grounds that they did not ‘own’ any land 
and/​or made ill use of it (Adhikari 2011, 19, 52). Making the land productive 
was indeed a common justification for assuming ownership during colonial 
conquest (Veracini 2007, 274). In general, indigenous inhabitants were seen 
as part of the wilderness, people without history in a place without history 
(ibid., 272). Overall attitudes towards the Khoisan in this period were highly 
derisive and degrading, with some even calling for their outright extermina­
tion (Guenther 1980, 135). To be sure, the Khoisan are not the only Africans in 
contemporary South African territory who were subjected to exoticization or 
highly derogatory views, but they arguably received harsher treatment in this 
regard (Lindfors 1996; see below).
Among the many things written about the Khoisan was their supposed 
bestial nature, miserable ways of life, oddly shaped genitals, revolting body 
odour, worship of false gods, raw-​meat diet, laziness, lack of intelligence, 
and proclivity towards theft (Van Wyk-​Smith 1992, 293, 296). Such details 
were honed in on, grossly exaggerated, or simply made up in order to deny 
the Khoisan their (full) humanity and to validate preconceived Eurocentric 
worldviews (Smith 1993, 8, 11). While degrading assessments of the Khoisan 
were the rule, there were noteworthy exceptions. A fascinating pre-​settle­
ment example is the 1647 account of two shipwrecked Dutch sailors, who 
vehemently denied the supposed cannibalistic and violent ways of the 
locals, since they had been taken excellent care of by them for six months 
until they were rescued by a passing ship (Marks 1981, 16). They even justified 
the Khoisan’s retaliatory behaviour by reasoning that Dutch people would 
‘not be a hair better’ if settlers had encroached on their soil. Ironically, how­
ever, this rather sympathetic portrayal of the Khoisan as harmless was drawn 
on to support the idea of establishing a permanent settlement (Worden, 
Van Heyningen, and Bickford-​Smith 1998, 15). As I show in the next sections, 
more sympathetic views of the Khoisan began appearing from the 19th cen­
tury onward in particular, after they had been more thoroughly decimated 
and dispossessed. There are important precursors in the 18th century, with 
travel writers and philosophers, including François Levaillant and Peter Kolb 
but also Jean-​Jacques Rousseau, portraying the Khoisan as ‘noble savages’, 
innocent children of nature who had been unjustly brutalized by Europeans 
(Van Wyk-​Smith 1992, 317). As David Johnson (2007, 544) reminds us, such 
views, uncommon as they were, coexisted alongside violent conquest and 
were hardly ever in direct opposition to colonialism. This paradox will sur­
face at various other points in this chapter.

(Re)Thinking the ‘Khoisan’
67
Seemingly more favourable views can coexist with derogatory ones as nei­
ther necessarily contradicts the aims of the settlers. Indigenous presences are 
disavowed either way, whether through encouraging or mourning their dis­
appearance. Crucial in this regard was the fact that Khoisan labour was not 
a make-​or-​break factor in settler expansion. Khoisan labour was certainly 
exploited by the settlers, but it ran second to the primary objective of procuring 
land (see also Carey and Silverstein 2020, 5). If the Khoisan were supplanted in 
this process, then this was accepted. Labour needs were met not only with new 
settlers but also with slaves who were shipped in from other parts of Africa and 
Asia (Ross 2017a, 188). The Khoisan were never officially enslaved, but those 
who joined the ranks of colonial labourers in practice suffered a similar fate, if 
not worse (see Ross 1979, 68; Elbourne 2003, 383). Slaves held (resale) value as a 
cheap self-​reproducing labour force, as opposed to the Khoisan (Adhikari 1992, 
104). This brings me back to Penn’s third option: ‘submit’. It is hard to estimate 
what percentage of Khoisan decided or were forced to become colonial labour­
ers (Elphick 1977, 175). Legions certainly did, mostly as farmworkers, domestic 
workers, or wagon drivers (Adhikari 2011, 19). In a testament to the rupture 
and chaos caused by colonialism, some Khoisan returned runaway slaves to 
settlers, joined the commandos, or formed a distinct battalion in the colonial 
army (Elbourne 2003, 393, Adhikari 2011, 73). While the Khoisan were never 
considered equal to settlers, neither in law or in practice, the extent to which 
they were allowed to assimilate into colonial society remains contested. As 
I show next, the debate surrounding their assimilation came to a head under 
British colonial rule.
2.1.2	
British Colonialism, Assimilation, and Salvage Ethnography 
(1795–​1910)
The British took over the Cape Colony from 1795 to 1910, with an interlude 
between 1803 and 1806, when the Dutch briefly resumed control. Now part 
of the vast British Empire, South Africa saw a steady influx of British settlers 
(Ross 2017a, 191). The British integrated to some extent with the existing Dutch/​
Afrikaans-​speaking settler population (known around this time as Afrikaner 
or Boer), but there was also a great deal of friction, which provoked the so-​
called Great Trek of the mid-​1830s, that is, the exodus of Afrikaners away 
from the Cape Colony, into the interior. This culminated in the founding of 
two Afrikaner republics in the 1850s, the Orange Free State and the Transvaal 
Republic, which retained their autonomy until the Boer wars of the early 20th 
century. This eastward movement of settlers resulted in violent clashes with 
the local population, which mostly consisted of Bantu-​speaking groups, par­
ticularly the amaXhosa and amaZulu, who, as mentioned earlier, had settled

in the Eastern half of South Africa between two to three thousand years ago. 
European settlement of these areas was nonetheless once more justified by 
notions of ‘vacant lands’ (Crais 1991, 256–​257), ownership of which once again 
justified as well on the grounds that European settlement would render it 
productive. Conversely, a persistent myth came into being during this time –​ 
often attributed to the widely influential historian George McCall Theal –​ that 
posited that Whites and Bantu-​speakers arrived in South Africa at the same 
time, albeit from opposite sides (Pillay 2004, 215–​216; Hamilton, Mbenga, and 
Ross 2010, 21). The Khoisan were acknowledged as the original inhabitants but 
not accorded a contemporary presence (Pillay 2004, 217–​218). With the indig­
enous people ‘gone’, everybody else was rendered a settler, with equally valid/​
invalid claims to the land (see Conclusion). Among other things, this myth was 
mobilized to legitimate the existence of the newly created Colony of Natal. 
The Khoisan had of course not simply disappeared but were instead increas­
ingly assimilated into settler-​colonial society under British rule, as I will show. 
While taking note of territories far away from the Cape, two Khoisan groups 
are worth briefly mentioning in this regard: the Griqua, who I have already 
mentioned various times, and the Khoisan at the Kat River settlement.
Although other Khoisan groups such as the Korana likely coalesced 
(partially) as a result of migrations away from the Cape Colony and frontier 
expansion (see e.g. Ross 1975), the Griqua are arguably the most sizeable and 
enduring collective. The origins of the Griqua are found in the 18th century, 
when various individuals, ranging from runaway slaves and local Khoisan 
to Bantu-​speaking individuals and so-​called Bastaards/​Basters (descen­
dants of mixed parentage, that is, Europeans and slaves, slaves and Khoisan, 
or Europeans and Khoisan), began to settle north of the Orange River and 
align themselves with Adam Kok I, likely a manumitted slave (Lewis 1987, 9; 
Waldman 2007b, 10, 59–​60; Cavanagh 2011, 5). This organic collective, referred 
to by many at the time as Basters but who self-​identified as Griqua, came into 
contact with the London Missionary Society, which had established its first 
mission aimed at the Khoisan in 1799 (Adhikari 2011, 63). The name ‘Griqua’ 
likely refers to the Grigriqua/​Griguriqua/​Chariguriqua tribe they had absorbed 
(Ross 1976, 12; Waldman 2007b, 10–​11, 59–​60, 62). The inclusivity of the Griqua 
has been likened to the rainbow nationalism of the early post-​apartheid era, 
and even to Khoisan revivalism, as the Griqua managed to maintain a form 
of continuity with Khoisan identity, if explicitly adapted to Christian values 
and blended with various other cultural influences (Cavanagh 2011, 8; Johnson 
2011, 166). The historical trajectory of the Griqua has been extensively docu­
mented and falls outside the scope of this book (see Waldman 2007b, 56–​87). 
What is crucial to take into account here is that they were initially successful

in procuring territory, often at the expense of local inhabitants, including 
other Khoisan (Penn 2003, 183; Waldman 2007b, 59–​60). Not unlike Afrikaners, 
Griqua trekked away from the Cape Colony to establish independent farm-​
based polities in the interior in the 19th century, most notably at Philipolis, 
Griquatown, and Kokstad (Waldman 2007b, 69). This relative autonomy, how­
ever, was discontinued after colonial authorities quelled a series of rebellions 
in the 1870s and set their sights on Griqua land, particularly the mineral depos­
its that lay beneath them (Cavanagh 2011, 8). This, however, as I show later, did 
not spell the end of Griqua politics.
The Khoisan at the Kat River settlement on the Eastern Frontier in many 
ways suffered a similar fate. The settlement, which lay on land traditionally 
utilized for cattle grazing by both Khoisan and amaXhosa, had been set up 
by the British in 1829 as a buffer zone with the amaXhosa, who they battled 
for decades (Elbourne 2003, 394). Many Khoisan, notably the brothers Klaas 
and David Stuurman, fought on the side of the amaXhosa against the British 
(Freund 1972, 631, 639). The Khoisan who assisted the British in pacifying the 
frontier were rewarded with plots of land in the settlement (Ross 1997b, 96). 
Khoisan from other parts of the country were also encouraged to join. Due to 
the sizeable presence of Khoisan that materialized as a result, some historians 
have argued that the dynamics of the Kat River settlement acted as a conduit 
for a type of Khoisan/​‘Hottentot’ nationalism that was premised on redressing 
the history of dispossession and decimation (ibid., 91, 99). However, as with 
the Griqua polities, the settlement did not last and with it went perhaps the 
last concerted armed resistance effort on part of the Khoisan, with the pos­
sible exception of the Korana wars, which ran into the 1880s (Elbourne 2003, 
394, Ross 1975). Indeed, according to Robert Ross (1997b, 92), the end of the 
settlement in the aftermath of the failed rebellion of 1851–​1852 also spelled the 
end of an active awareness and expression of Khoisan identity, since thereafter 
such expressions became highly inopportune.
The Kat River settlement was an important experiment in the wake of 
Ordinance 50 of 1828, which recognized land and property ownership by non-​
White individuals (Elbourne 2003, 389, 394). The cynicism inherent in Khoisan 
buying back land they were originally dispossessed of went unacknowledged. 
The involvement of the London Missionary Society with the Khoisan at the Kat 
River settlement and elsewhere also bears witness to the wider push to assim­
ilate the Khoisan as Christian labourers and colonial subjects (Elphick and 
Malherbe 1989, 39–​42; Ross 1997b, 92; Elbourne 2003, 387). This assimilationist 
philosophy sets the British apart from the Dutch, but there were also many 
continuities. The commando system was reluctantly tolerated for some time, 
though eventually discontinued (Adhikari 2011, 60, 64). Speaking in particular

Chapter 2
about the plight of the San, Jared McDonald (2016b, 521) notes that while the 
British sought to quell their brutal treatment, they still violently coerced them 
to relinquish their indigenous culture, to their own supposed benefit. As pas­
toralist Khoikhoi were deemed more suitable as farm workers than the ‘wild’ 
hunter-​gatherer San, adult male San were in particular seen as expendable 
(Penn 2003, 185). San children and women were for their part often taken cap­
tive as their indoctrination was deemed more feasible (ibid., 186). This delib­
erate denial of indigenous sociocultural identity and ways of life is a feature of 
settler-​colonial societies elsewhere, and in effect amounts to cultural genocide 
(McDonald 2016b, 522, 524).
The erasure of Khoisan indigeneity was accompanied by a high degree of 
paternalism. The Caledon Code of 1809, which required Khoisan to have a ‘fixed 
place of abode’ and carry identity-​documents at all times to prove that they 
were not vagrants, was justified on grounds that it would lead the ‘Hottentot 
nation’ away from a life of indolence (Elbourne 2003, 387; Dooling 2005, 
50). A common depiction of the Khoisan in the 19th century was that of the 
drunken drifter (Worden, Van Heyningen, and Bickford-​Smith 1998, 156). The 
state was judged to be a better warden than the abusive bosses on the farms. 
The latter for instance frequently reimbursed labour in the form of alcohol and 
tobacco under the so-​called ‘tot system’, which had devastating intergenera­
tional effects on the Coloured population (Bredekamp and Netwon-​King 1984, 
2–​3). As purchasing land was not a realistic option, in practice legislation such 
as the Caledon Code bound the Khoisan to the farms or mission stations they 
were working on (Dooling 2005, 50). Most Khoisan became integrated into 
colonial society as landless proletarians through such processes and a series 
of pro-​imperialist humanitarian efforts were aimed at dealing with those for 
whom assimilation was more difficult or unsuccessful. Missionaries and clergy 
took the lead in campaigning for the abolition of slavery and signalling the ill 
treatment of the Khoisan (Freund 1972, 641; Ross 1997b, 97). A range of com­
missions were created to investigate the living conditions of the Khoisan in the 
British colony, most notably under the Reverend John Philip (Brantlinger 2014, 
79–​80; McDonald 2016b, 529). While these had little impact on the lives of 
the Khoisan, an interesting exception is the brief existence of ‘Bushmanland’, 
a vaguely defined area in the Northern Cape intended as a reserve for the 
Bushmen, where settlers were not allowed to enter without permission from 
the state (Adhikari 2011, 63; see below).
Initiatives such as these reflected the widespread consensus that so-​called 
primitive societies would vanish in the face of Western civilization (Brantlinger 
2014, 1–​2, 199; see also Forte 2006, 46). This notion had been around for some 
time but received a boost with the proliferation of Social Darwinism in the late

19th century, which held that natives were fated to perish due to their inherent 
biological inferiority (Wolfe 1999, 39). For their part, anthropologists rushed in 
the second half of the 19th century and thereafter to ‘salvage’ the supposedly 
few remaining ‘authentic’ elements of native life and culture through meticu­
lous documentation or safekeeping in reservations, as if to freeze them in time 
before their corruption or disappearance was a done deal (Forte 2006, 9). So-​
called salvage anthropology has its roots in North America, but was practiced 
with rigour in South Africa as well, where traditional Khoisan were studied as 
‘living fossils’ (Clifford 1989, 73; Lane 1996, 7; Rassool 2019, 356). Bantu-​speak­
ing populations were not judged to be facing extinction due to their greater 
numbers and supposedly more advanced stage of civilization (Dubow 1995, 
66; Brantlinger 2014, 13). This is a time when the Khoisan extinction discourse 
flourished. Robert Gordon (2014, 111) even goes so far as to suggest that ‘dis­
covering something of “the last wild Bushmen” has become something of a 
(White) South African tradition’ ever since. Before they would cease to exist, 
scientists rushed to examine, label, and collect what they saw as the peculiar­
ities of the Khoisan. This includes the well-​known late 19th century and early 
20th century efforts by linguists and racial theorists Wilhelm Bleek and Lucy 
Lloyd –​ often accredited with pioneering Khoisan studies –​ to record and pub­
lish stories from the last remaining /​Xam speakers (Deacon 1997, 20; Wright 
and Weintroub 2014, 735).4 Salvage anthropology also nursed an obsession 
with physical features (Rassool 2019, 356). The latter involved, as Miscast would 
later admonish, measuring skulls, making body casts, and examining human 
remains, often stolen from graves and at various times shipped to scientific 
institutions abroad (Morris 1987; Rassool 2019). This type of enquiry also moti­
vated the physical anthropologist Leonhard Schultze to coin the term ‘Khoisan’ 
in 1928 while investigating phenotypical, linguistic, or cultural similarities 
	4	 It is important to appreciate how the efforts of colonial-​era linguists such as Bleek and Lloyd 
were not just attempts at describing linguistic realities. They also served as means through 
which ‘Westerners interpreted the world, categorized its peoples, and affirmed the supe­
riority of their own position within it’ (Gilmour 2006, 2). These categorizations projected 
homogenous and clearly bounded units, which often ‘mapped badly, if at all, onto existing 
social realities, or pre-​colonial African ideas about languages and identities’ (ibid., 11). In the 
1850s, Bleek for instance created the highly influential linguistic-​based distinction between 
‘Hottentot’, ‘Bushman’, and ‘Bantu’ –​ the later classificatory label he coined himself –​ and 
he linked these groups to separate stages of evolutionary development, as well as particular 
cultural and racial traits (ibid., 169, 175, 195). While the historical and contemporary purchase 
of these categories may be put into question, this is not my aim here as I focus on emic iden­
tifications. As I argue in Chapter 7 with regards to Khoisan revivalist appropriations of the 
ethnographic archive in general, such terminology and ideas can be molded to fit present 
needs and ascribed new or altered meanings in the process.

Chapter 2
between Khoi and San –​ a concept that was particularly popularized after the 
publication of noted anthropologist Isaac Schapera’s The Khoisan peoples of 
South Africa in 1930. As I show next, the dynamics regarding the Khoisan that 
came into being in the second half of the 19th century would reach fever pitch 
in the following century.
2.1.3	
Union, Apartheid, and Coloured Citizens (1910–​1970s)
The 1910 Union of South Africa united the colonies of the Cape, Orange River, 
Natal, and Transvaal. As Edward Cavanagh (2013, 7) notes, although the British 
and Afrikaner settlers in these territories were marked by differences in lan­
guage and culture, and the latter had been defeated by the former in battle 
during the Boer wars, they found common cause in securing their position at 
the top of the socioeconomic pecking order. A crucial piece of legislation in 
this regard was the 1913 Natives Land Act, which legally enshrined the prop­
erty ownership patterns that had come about after centuries of dispossession. 
The Act forbade the Bantu-​speaking majority from buying or owning land out­
side of ‘Native reserves’, which together made up about 13 percent of available 
territory (Walker 2014, 655, 659). The remaining land, which was much more 
valuable and fertile, was exclusively available to Whites. Roughly three decades 
later, segregation was implemented even further. In the aftermath of the elec­
toral victory of the Afrikaner-​nationalist National Party in 1948, the apartheid 
doctrine became official policy and settlers left the British Commonwealth 
altogether with the founding of the Republic of South Africa in 1961.
As I noted in the Introduction, apartheid was a set of institutionalized 
policies that policed everyday contexts by according privileges to individu­
als based on their membership in the newly carved out racial groups White, 
Coloured, Indian, and Black. This resulted in an inherently ambiguous bureau­
cratic exercise in racial boundary-​making and management. Notwithstanding 
the arbitrary nature of its verdicts, so-​called native administration articulated 
its demographic labels in relation to the convoluted history of enumerating, 
naming, and legislating population groups that preceded it. The censuses 
that had been carried out previously had used a wide variety of categories. 
The challenge here is to avoid projecting meaning onto such categories anach­
ronistically, specifically when it comes to the use of ‘Native’ and ‘Bantu’. The 
1903–​1905 South African Native Affairs Commission ruled that ‘Native’ would 
henceforth refer to the ‘aboriginal inhabitants of Africa, [including] half-​castes 
and their descendants’ (Pillay 2004, 222). ‘Native’ would subsequently often 
include the Khoisan, although they would also be enumerated as ‘Hottentots’, 
‘Aboriginal Native’, ‘Bantu’, or ‘Coloured’ (see below), depending on the degree 
to which their ways were deemed ‘rural’ (Posel 2001, 93; Christopher 2009, 104).

(Re)Thinking the ‘Khoisan’

From 1951 onward, however, ‘Native’ was replaced by ‘Bantu’ (and adjacent 
subcategories), based on the then prevailing assumption that linguistic com­
munities reflected distinct cultural ones, which were in turn transformed into 
administrable tribal units (Pillay 2004, 226–​227). In 1978, the term ‘Black’ began 
to be favoured (Adhikari 2011, 100). For settlers, these substitutions resolved 
the rather awkward implication of the term ‘Native’ with regards to claims 
to the land (Erasmus 2017, 88). Indeed, as Suren Pillay (2004, 221) remarked, 
this process ironically made settlers belong by turning natives into strangers. 
As he goes on to argue, this ‘discursive shift’ found expression along a contin­
uum: decimation, assimilation, and finally through an emphasis on difference 
and segregation in the 20th century.
As I noted in the Introduction, the ideal of ‘distinctiveness’ through sepa­
rate development was promulgated by the anthropological school known as 
volkekunde, and in particular through influential figures such as Werner Eiselen 
and Nicolaas Jacobus van Warmelo (Spiegel and Becker 2015, 755; Rassool 2019, 
352). Echoing premises of salvage anthropology, volkekundiges argued that 
apartheid would safeguard and nurse the supposedly innate cultural values of 
ethnic groups (Pillay 2004, 224–​225). To realize this vision, vetted pro-​regime 
traditional authorities were put in charge of self-​governing homelands, or 
Bantustans, which were established for the different Bantu-​speaking groups 
in the country from the 1960s onward. The apartheid dispensation fervently 
promoted the development of Bantu culture in these areas (Meskell 2011, 66). 
The same paternalistic reasoning regarding the maintenance of racial purity 
was used to justify limiting the type of jobs that were open to non-​Whites. 
Homelands were in practice vastly overcrowded cheap labour reserves with 
poor infrastructure and were highly dependent on Whites for various forms of 
support (Posel 2011, 329). Segregation was not limited to rural areas, but was 
also implemented in the cities. A key piece of legislation in this regard was the 
Group Areas Act of 1950, which brought about racially homogenous residen­
tial areas (ibid., 335). This and similar legislation ultimately led to the forced 
removal of close to four million people from their homes between 1913 and 
1983 (Field 2001, 119). While apartheid ideologues kept insisting that Africans 
were innately rural and did not belong in cities, and they were only allowed in 
the Western Cape if their documentation allowed them to do so, for instance if 
they had employment there, they kept settling on urban peripheries in search 
of jobs and a better life –​ a trend that continues till this day (Western 2001, 
624–​625; Rassool 2019, 353).
The same reasoning was not extended to those classified as Coloured. The 
historiography on Coloured identity is not settled on its meaning, both histor­
ically and contemporary, legally and symbolically. People remain at odds over

Chapter 2
whether Coloured is a top-​down construction or a bottom-​up one (Erasmus 
2001, 16). While the degree to which Coloured referred and refers to a shared 
historical experience continues to be debated, it undoubtedly became a 
socially significant term to many (Adhikari 1992, 99, 110). As will be evident 
at various points in this book, Coloured remains a rather open-​ended term. 
With these important caveats in mind, the term ‘Coloured’ came into usage 
in the second half of the 19th century by way of lumping together diverse 
groups of people who had been known previously (or interchangeably) by 
various other names, including assimilated Khoisan, but also the aforemen­
tioned Basters, Asians, and other descendants of mixed parentage (Giliomee 
1995, 204; Worden, Van Heyningen and Bickford-​Smith 1998, 177). This vaguely 
defined group was present mostly in the Cape Colony and particularly in Cape 
Town. As Vivian Bickford-​Smith (2012, 146) put it, segregation was more ‘de 
facto than de jure’ in pre-​apartheid Cape Town, and only really sped up with 
the creation of the Union of South Africa, where race replaced class as the 
most significant social marker. In the Cape Colony, for instance, the right to 
vote was extended to non-​Whites during the 19th century, if steadily curtailed 
thereafter, and entirely abolished for both groups during apartheid (Beinart 
and Dubow 1995, 3–​4; Elbourne 2003, 397; Christopher 2009, 105). This had 
little effect as too few were able to meet the stringent educational and property 
criteria to form a critical demographic (Giliomee 1995, 205, 219; Rassool 2019, 
358). This is not to say that the politics of demography did not play a role in 
the city and beyond. In fact, some argue that the earliest segregationist policies 
are to be found there at the turn of the 20th century, with an outbreak of the 
bubonic plague and the subsequent removal of Bantu-​speaking populations 
from the city centre to the periphery, supposedly to stop its spread (Beinart 
and Dubow 1995, 6–​7).
Though fitted within segregationist schemes as well, Coloureds occupied a 
different place than Bantu-​speaking Africans. Indeed, in the course of the 20th 
century, through distinctly tailored cultural, economic, and social policies, 
Coloured took on a slightly different meaning and increasingly began to refer 
to Afrikaans-​speakers who were not categorized as Black or White (or Asian), 
but were considered ‘mixed’ (Erasmus 2017, 112). As a result, several settle­
ments that had been created as mission stations in the Northern Cape were for 
instance transformed into Coloured ‘reserves’ in 1961, where Coloureds would 
get preferential treatment in terms of land ownership and access to grazing 
lands (Oakley 2006, 491). Moreover, parts of the Northern Cape and Western 
Cape fell within the confines of the ‘Eiselen line’ of 1954 –​ named after the 
aforementioned volkekundige and following more or less the borders of the 
old British Cape Colony, wherein the labour of Coloureds was preferred over

that of others (Western 2001, 624). Blacks could (in theory) only be hired if no 
Coloureds were available to fill the position; a rule that remained in effect till 
1984 (Van Kessel 2000, 227). This also applied to Cape Town, where Coloureds 
were steadily relocated from the centre to the public housing developments 
on the Cape Flats from the 1920s onward, causing 150,000 displaced people by 
the late 1960s (Wilkinson 2000, 196). To be sure, Coloured reserves and town­
ships equally functioned as overcrowded (in)formal labour dormitories with 
poor infrastructure, but these were generally speaking (marginally) better ser­
viced than areas where Blacks had to reside (Chetty 2015, 57). Though nowhere 
in the vicinity of the standards applied to Whites, social welfare and housing 
schemes were for example more elaborate for Coloureds than for Blacks (Salo 
2003, 549).
Coloured areas differed in design from homelands in that they were not 
aimed at the preservation of a distinct culture. Coloured culture and iden­
tity always remained highly ambiguous. The 1950s Population Registration 
Act for example defined Coloureds as those who are ‘obviously’ neither Black 
or White. Prior to the impact of the anti-​apartheid ideology of the 1970s and 
1980s, but arguably even thereafter (see below), European ancestry was clearly 
fronted by the vast majority (Worden 2009, 25). Many for instance straight­
ened their hair in order to appear less ‘African’ (Simone 1994, 166). Adhikari 
(1992, 110) argues that the incorporation of Bantu-​speakers into the labour 
force in the wake of territorial conquest and the mineral revolution of the late 
19th century accounts for their pro-​White attitudes. Threatened by the com­
petition, ‘Coloured petty bourgeoisie’ assumed that emphasizing proximity to 
European ways of life and phenotypes was the best strategy to keep an edge 
over Blacks (ibid., 103). This ideology of defending relative privilege under­
pinned Coloured interest groups such as the African Political Organization, 
founded in 1902 (Adhikari 2002). Whites for their part encouraged aspirations 
to Whiteness. During the apartheid years, members of the National Party 
often flirted with notions of ‘Coloured/​bruin [brown] Afrikaners’ and poten­
tial greater benefits, while simultaneously keeping full equality firmly at bay 
(Giliomee 1995, 211). The latter could be denied by falling back on the notion 
that Coloureds were ‘tainted’ by non-​White influences. Sourced from centuries 
of derogatory representation, apartheid’s forceful indoctrination and politics 
of race led Coloureds to internalize a sense of inferiority, not least by (publicly) 
refuting slave and particularly Khoisan ancestry (Smith 1983, 39, 47; Nienaber 
1989, 84; Adhikari 2002, 56). One spokesperson for instance proudly asserted 
in 1937 that ‘all traces of [Coloureds’] Hottentot ancestry have entirely disap­
peared’ (Desmore 1937, 347).

Chapter 2
Legislation also played a role in effacing Khoisan identity. Various scholars 
have noted in this regard how the 1950 Population Registration Act legislated 
the Khoisan out of existence, with ‘one stroke of the bureaucratic pen’ (Besten 
2009: 136–​137; Ellis 2012, 11). The Act consolidated a lengthy process of ‘discur­
sive erasure’ (Cavanagh 2011, 30–​31) that ultimately rendered the Khoisan lost 
in categorization. As I noted, Coloured identity remained vague at all times, 
and its application as a demographic demarcation tool continuously ran into 
practical problems as a result. The various bureaucratic commissions and legal 
amendments that attempted to clarify its boundaries never mentioned the 
Khoisan (Lewis 1987, 3). A 1959 legal revision for instance made provisions for 
seven Coloured subgroups, introducing categories such as ‘Cape Malay’ (see 
Worden 2009, 26; Bickford-​Smith 2012, 138) and ‘Other Coloured’ (Posel 2001, 
102). True, the category ‘Griqua’ also made the cut for some time, although 
some Griqua became classified as Bantu (Waldman 2007b, 90–​91). The govern­
ment recognized a Griqua subcategory in part to validate the specific histori­
cal and contemporary elements of Khoisan culture, such as the prevalence of 
certain traditions or the occasional speaker of Khoisan languages (ibid.). This, 
however, was not so much an acknowledgement of Khoisan ancestry, as it was 
a definitive official branding of the Griqua as Coloured (ibid., 36).
At this stage the Griqua believed their political future was best guaran­
teed by throwing in their lot with Coloureds as opposed to emphasizing an 
indigenous or African identity (Waldman 2007b, 92). European lineage was 
(reluctantly) accentuated as a result (Besten 2006, 263). Ultimately, however, 
this strategy did not pay off in the sense that, several commissions of enquiry 
later, a ‘distinctive’ Griqua identity did not receive official acknowledgement, 
and the Griqua homeland that some campaigned for until the 1980s was not 
established (Besten 2006, 223; Waldman 2007a, 165). Interestingly, one of the 
motivations the 1983 committee provided for not creating a separate Griqua 
category was that it might be seen as an acknowledgment of aboriginality, 
which in turn could set a precedent for others with similar ancestry to come 
forward (Besten 2006, 244). One of the factors that compounded the inability 
to procure special rights for the Griqua was the absence of a united front. 
Foreshadowing similar arguments of the post-​apartheid era, disunity was one 
of the reasons why apartheid anthropologists did not grant the Griqua the 
recognition they desired (Waldman 2007b, 36). Throughout the 20th century, 
infighting around leadership positions led to the formation of several splinter 
groups of Griqua, who amassed their own followers (Waldman 2007a, 163). 
This complex history falls outside the scope of this book (see Waldman 2007b; 
Besten 2006). For present purposes the most relevant group to mention is the 
Griqua National Conference (gnc), as they play an important role in the history

of Khoisan revivalism as well (see below). Created in 1920 by Paramount Chief 
a.a.s. Le Fleur I, the gnc consisted of the newly created Griqua Independent 
Church and the more politically oriented wing. The organization was created 
in Maitland, Cape Town, and a following of Griqua remains there today, but 
the gnc’s activities mostly concerned traditional Griqua areas in the interior 
(Besten 2006, 103).5 Despite a split that occurred in the organization in 1967, 
through its involvement in politics, syncretic Christianity, and the spread of 
its newspaper –​ the tellingly titled The Griqua and Coloured Peoples’ Opinion, 
the gnc emerged during this time as the main vehicle for Griqua political 
aspirations. This in turn made Griqua identity endure in the face of dispos­
sessions and political disappointments (Waldman 2007b, 43; Boezak 2019, 91–​
93, 127). Nevertheless, the gnc generally conformed to the pattern outlined 
above. While occasionally acknowledging speaking on behalf of the ‘offspring 
of the Hottentot race’, Le Fleur himself tailored his aspirations to the political 
realities of the day and strongly profiled the gnc on Colouredness (Besten 
2006, 155).
The plight of the Griqua illustrates the ultimately inescapable imposition 
of apartheid’s tri-​racial native administration as top-​down racial categories by 
the state became reified as social identifiers. Indigeneity lost much of its rel­
evance within apartheid ideology: it had either been appropriated by settlers 
or was considered dissolved among Coloureds as the result of miscegenation 
(see also Cavanagh 2013, 11). References to the Khoisan had become largely 
meaningless, with the term (and its many alternatives) steadily losing its pur­
chase on altered social realities. The Khoisan’s assimilation as Coloured was 
considered a fait accompli. Khoisan history was largely subsumed and com­
pounded by that of Coloured identity, an empty shell devoid of connotations 
of indigeneity and manipulated to best suit the aims of settlers (see also Wolfe 
1999, 34; Cavanagh 2013, 10). As Marike de Klerk infamously put it in 1983, 
‘[coloureds] are a negative group […] They are the leftovers. They are the peo­
ple that were left after the nations were sorted out’ (Marike de Klerk cited in 
Adhikari 2002, 35). Purportedly often referring to themselves as a people with­
out history, Coloureds’ self-​effacement was accelerated (Hattingh 1988, 41). 
‘Coloured’ Khoisan descendants certainly suffered through their enrolment 
in the apartheid system. But Khoisan presences as ‘Khoisan’ were disavowed, 
	5	 More research is needed to ascertain continuities between current-​day residents in the Cape 
Flats and Griqua heritage. While I did not come across such continuities myself and the peo­
ple I interacted with did not mention this either, this could be an oversight on my and their 
part. It is my understanding that, at the time of writing, June Bam-​Hutchison is working on a 
research project that looks precisely at these issues.

which differed from attitudes towards those that were eventually classed as 
Black. As the apartheid system relied heavily on their labour, the Bantu-​speak­
ing populations were not approached with the same type of assimilationist or 
annihilationist policies. To be sure, their territorial conquest and subsequent 
dispossession and discrimination was devastating, but it was not premised on 
an ‘extinction discourse’. At the time, the Khoisan were much fewer in number, 
did not constitute a crucial labour pool, no longer practiced a vibrant culture 
or posed a threat to the system that warranted their containment in home­
lands. At most, reserves were considered for assimilated descendants (Robins 
2001, 847). This is not to ascertain who suffered more than others but to iden­
tify important differences in processes of colonization (see also Veracini and 
Verbuyst 2020).
While ‘Khoisan’ identification faded during this time, Khoisan represen­
tation endured. Assimilated Khoisan were of little interest to researchers, 
unless conceptualized as Coloured (see e.g. Carstens 1966), but the reverse is 
true when it came to those Khoisan who had undergone far less assimilation, 
the San. Against the backdrop of the Khoisan extinction discourse, one could 
posit that the Khoi became ignored in favour of the San in both the academic 
and political sense (see below). Although equally enumerated as Coloured, 
the San were appraised as the last remaining traditional Khoisan specimens 
in the spirit of the aforementioned paradigm of salvage ethnography (Sylvain 
2003b, 112). The prominent historian Isaac Schapera had little doubt in 1930 
that the San were on the verge of extinction: ‘what persecution at the hands 
of other peoples has not achieved is being slowly accomplished by disease 
and racial intermixture’ (Schapera cited in Tobias 1956, 184). In a rather self-​
serving manner, physical anthropologist Phillip Tobias likewise ascertained 
in 1956 that ‘extinction by hybridization’ was awaiting the Bushmen and that 
this would deprive anthropologists of ‘a tremendously important insight into 
human development’ (Tobias 1956, 185). Tobias urgently called for studies 
to document the purported last of their kind in their supposed traditional 
habitat: the remote stretches of the Kalahari Desert across Southern Africa, 
Namibia, and Botswana in particular. Prospects of locating and studying these 
pristine hunter-​gatherers captivated anthropologists (Wilmsen 1995, 2). Agnes 
Winifred Hoernlé, for instance recorded in 1917 how she scouted numerous 
locations in search for Khoisan who had experienced the least encounters 
with settlers (Abrahams 1995, 26). Viewed as curiously surviving anomalies, 
the Bushmen were ‘identified as distinctly South African finds and resources’, 
and subsequently ‘subject to major projects of collection, documentation, and 
preservation […] They were unearthed, demonstrated, annotated, labelled, 
transported, cast, interviewed, reproduced, photographed, exhibited, drawn,

captured, dissected, celebrated, proclaimed, and classified’ (Witz, Minley, and 
Rassool 2017, 182).
Opinions regarding the (in)ability of these remaining pockets of Khoisan 
to assimilate kept circulating. As late as 1936, the Minister of Native Affairs 
referred to them as ‘fauna […] incapable of assimilating to European ideas’ 
(Gordon 1995, 30–​31). Such views were frequently espoused alongside more 
favourable ones (see above). No longer a threat to their rule, settlers could 
afford more sympathetic assessments of the Khoisan: nothing approximat­
ing restitution, but rather manifested through a preservationist ethic (ibid., 
251). On one level, this concerned pre-​historic markers of Khoisan presence. 
The Bushmen Relics Act of 1911 was the first conservation legislation in South 
Africa and aimed not only to protect rock art sites but also to stifle the (inter)
national trade in human remains (Legassick and Rassool 2000, 1). Such col­
lections had been formed already under British rule but boomed in the early 
20th century –​ with many scientific institutions in South Africa and abroad 
still housing vast collections of Khoisan remains (Schramm 2016, 133). Louis 
Péringuey, director of the South African Museum from 1906 to 1924 was for 
example an avid collector of human remains and created several replicas of 
living Khoisan in the form of body casts (McGee 2008, 121). Under his com­
mand the ‘museum modeller’ James Drury made casts of the ‘last remaining 
Bushmen’ in 1907, which would in turn feature in the notorious ‘diorama’ at 
the South African museum (Dubow 1995, 36; Davison 2001, 14). Created in 1959 
and on show from 1960 to 2001, the diorama depicted Khoisan hunter-​gath­
erer ways of life. It was the museum’s most prized attraction, including among 
non-​White visitors (Davison 2001, 4; Rassool 2015, 660).6 As the audience was 
invited to gaze upon a supposedly extinct Stone Age race, guides often capital­
ized on the occasion to share and reify Khoisan stereotypes (Skotnes 2001, 311).
This fossilization logic extended beyond scientific institutions and muse­
ums, and affected living Khoisan as well. General Smuts for instance notori­
ously referred to the Khoisan as ‘living fossils’, who should be allowed to hunt 
in a demarcated area in the Northern Cape provided they use ‘traditional 
weaponry’ (Gordon 1995, 32). This, it seems, was the type of Khoisan exis­
tence that the apartheid dispensation allowed for. As an expression of what 
Renato Rosaldo (Rosaldo 1989, 108) terms ‘imperialist nostalgia’, the mourning 
of what colonialism destroyed, settlers were on some occasions reminiscent, 
	6	 Supporters of the diorama, which included some Khoisan, felt that it was a crucial instru­
ment to get people to learn about Khoisan culture. Critics on the other hand dismissed it 
as an offensive and colonialist portrayal of the Khoisan. The latter camp eventually won the 
argument and the diorama was dismantled in April 2001 (see Davison 2001).

or oddly proud, of the state of their ‘conquered’ subjects. Khoisan were exhib­
ited abroad –​ the most famous case being Sarah Baartman (see Chapter 3) –​ 
but they were also paraded at home. During the 1952 celebration of 300 years 
since the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck, a Bushmen delegation housed in the 
South-​West Africa pavilion was among the most popular stands. Visitors were 
promised the ‘last remnant of [an] almost extinct aboriginal people’ (Witz 
1993, 13, 19). Cast in this fashion, Khoisan were on display as potent objects 
for image building and scientific examination. Viewed as rare resources, there 
have been attempts to protect and ‘save’ the Bushmen under ‘crisis’ as early as 
1836 (Gordon 1995, 28). The claim made earlier that no homelands were ever 
created for the Khoisan needs to be nuanced. In 1935, the head of the Rhenish 
Missionary Society for example campaigned for two Bushmen reserves to be 
created in South-​West Africa after it was transferred from Germany to South 
Africa as a protectorate in the wake of World War I (Gordon 1992, 119). Similar 
pleas were made in 1949 and 1959 (Hoernlé 1925, 8; Gordon 1992, 163, 175). 
While it is unclear to what extent such plans gained traction, they did not 
lead to the establishment of a homeland. The only exception here is the cre­
ation of Bushmanland in 1964, a non-​self-​governing small piece of land in the 
Otjozondjupa Region (Sylvain 2003b, 112). This was negligible however in the 
overall history of dispossession and assimilation.7
The noble savage idea had not disappeared either but was recycled in the 
second half of the 20th century (Barnard 2007, 129; Wright and Weintroub 
2014, 736). Up until then, the Khoisan had mostly been studied through the 
discipline of physical anthropology, as opposed to Blacks, who were studied 
in the main by social anthropologists and volkekundiges (Rassool 2019, 354). 
Interest in the Khoisan among anthropologists of all stripes increased after 
World War ii due to the production of influential works of fiction, particu­
larly the written and televised works of Laurens van der Post, such as Lost 
World of the Kalahari (1958) and The Heart of the Hunter (1961) (Barnard 2007, 
59). Together with Jamie Uys’ The Gods Must be Crazy blockbuster comedy 
movies of the 1980s, these instilled a romanticized image of the Bushmen 
as innocent and primitive, if cunning, hunter-​gatherers among the general 
public (Barnard 2007, 129; Gordon 2014, 111). They also promoted the notion 
that the Khoisan were ‘ethnically particular, culturally vulnerable, and threat­
ened’ (Gordon 1992, 214). Anthropologists assisted in this redefinition of the 
Khoisan by reappraising them as the ‘original affluent society’ and attrib­
uting them with positive qualities such as generosity, egalitarianism, and

peacefulness, which Western civilization was deemed to lack (Guenther 1980, 
123; Barnard 2007, 69). Another popular designation was ‘harmless people’; 
coined by the American Marshall family of anthropologists who carried out 
ethnographic fieldwork among the !Kung in Northern Namibia and Botswana 
between the 1950s and 1970s (Guenther 1980, 123; Barnard 2007, 58). Their 
work enticed countless anthropologists, especially from North America, to 
descend on the Kalahari and conduct their own fieldwork (Wilmsen 1989, xv; 
Barnard 1992, 296).
Detailing their work would put me off track. The broader point is that it 
highlights the status quo of Khoisan representation after centuries of colo­
nialism. The legacies of this history are present throughout this book and 
affect Khoisan revivalism as much as its societal reception. Before Khoisan 
revivalism, whatever was publicly written or said about the Khoisan involved 
anthropologists and other scientists, but increasingly also artists, writers, 
and other members of the general public (Guenther 1980, 123). The Khoisan 
themselves were left out of the equation. Certainly, as far as I could tell there 
were no Khoisan pressure groups during apartheid. This would not have 
been tolerated by the regime, nor found traction among the vast majority of 
Khoisan descendants who had internalized Coloured identities after centu­
ries of assimilation and dispossession. Griqua politics certainly remained a 
factor, but this was caught up in debates on Coloured assimilation. Khoisan 
representation was instead sourced mainly from the Kalahari Desert during 
apartheid, where salvation or salvaging were still considered actions worth 
pursuing. However, as I show next, it is in part in relation to the Kalahari’s 
polar opposite, Cape Town, that rigid conceptions of Khoisan culture and 
identity began to be subverted and the first signs of Khoisan revivalism were 
becoming apparent.

Black Consciousness, Khoisan Revisionist Historiography, and the 
Origins of Khoisan Revivalism (1970s–​1997)
Starting this subchapter in the 1970s is to a certain extent arbitrary. Resistance 
to apartheid and colonialism is as old as the systems themselves. Neither was 
there a greater degree of Khoisan revivalism in the 1970s than the preceding or 
following decade. In retrospect, however, a series of events during this time, 
most not directly related to Khoisan issues and some originating in the 1960s 
and even earlier, clearly formed the basis for the Khoisan revivalism that crys­
talized in Cape Town after 1994: the rejection of Coloured identity among a 
critical minority of Coloureds during the anti-​apartheid struggle, the spread of

Chapter 2
Black Consciousness philosophy, and the proliferation of Khoisan revisionist 
historiography.8
Before making my case, I need to expand on a caveat concerning histori­
cal continuity that I began to unpack in the Introduction. I do not claim that 
people were not relating to Khoisan identity prior to Khoisan revivalism. Such 
an excessive assessment does not live up to empirical scrutiny, as numerous 
accounts in this book confirm (see also Hoff 1993,2; 1995, 29; Western 2001, 621; 
Øvernes 2019, 55).9 Yvette Abrahams (16/​07/​2019) expressed her scepticism at 
the notion of revivalism to me as follows: ‘I always knew who I was […] iden­
tity changes through every generation, it can be suppressed and oppressed, 
but the notion of revival, that it disappeared and then came back, is one from 
the top’. In her 1994 ma thesis, Abrahams (1994, 10) claimed that residents of 
Mitchells Plain and Bonteheuwel in the Cape Flats area ‘always’ acknowledged 
their ‘Khoi’ lineage when she asked them about their identity. Whether her 
or my interlocutors were aware of their Khoisan lineage to the extent that 
they purport to be is not my concern. In any case, proto-​Khoisan revivalists 
were evidently eclipsed by assimilated Coloureds or those identifying as Black 
during the anti-​apartheid struggle (see below), something which Khoisan 
revivalists readily acknowledge. They would also confirm that, pre-​1994, com­
municating about the Khoisan took place in private (cf. Waldman 2007b, 138; 
De Wet 2011, 101). Publicly proclaiming such identities was not tolerated by the 
apartheid dispensation, who for instance violently cracked down on people 
speaking Khoisan languages (Bam-​Hutchison 2016, 22). Embracing Khoisan 
ancestry during this time indeed meant going against the grain of centuries of 
derogatory Khoisan representation and forceful assimilationist policies. The 
Khoisan extinction discourse conflates assimilation and dispossession with 
cultural and physical obliteration, thereby directly/​indirectly disavowing con­
temporary Khoisan identities, but the effects of these processes were certainly 
devastating. When people, including Khoisan revivalists, note that ‘nobody 
identified as Khoisan before 1994’, this should not be taken as an absolute but 
	8	 It should be noted that what I present in this chapter are in many ways superficial observa­
tions about the ways in which Khoisan revivalism’s intellectual history ties into the longer 
Cape intellectual tradition of championing non-​racialism and critiquing White minority 
rule. The work of Crain Soudien (2019) constitutes an excellent starting point to flesh out 
these links in closer detail.
	9	 Continuity with the Khoisan past, if clandestinely communicated through specific strategies, 
including seemingly going along with assimilationist policies, has also been reported with 
regards to !Xam identity (Parkington, Morris, and De Prada-​Samper 2019, 730) or a group of 
San in the Drakensberg region in KwaZulu-​Natal, often referred to as the ‘Secret San’ (Francis 
2009; 2010; Prins 2009).

rather as a reference to the devastating impact of colonialism, as well as the 
critical turning point that is Khoisan revivalism.
2.2.1	
Black Consciousness and the Reinvention of Coloured Identity in the 
Anti-​apartheid Struggle
The anti-​apartheid struggle faced Coloureds with a dilemma. One option was 
to push for greater rights within the apartheid system. This path had been pur­
sued for several decades and although it had safeguarded Coloureds’ position 
of relative privilege, it also kept brushing up against the limits of the regime’s 
assimilationist policies. The alternative was to join the coalition of South 
Africans of all stripes in opposing apartheid and fighting for a more just soci­
ety by relinquishing their distinctive status. A third possibility could have been 
a militant Coloured nationalism that framed Coloured identity and history as 
a rallying point for their grievances, and perhaps even as a basis for solidar­
ity with others in the resistance to apartheid. Coloured intellectuals however 
never succeeded in providing an inspirational unifying historical narrative or 
in exchanging the previously mentioned stigmas regarding miscegenation and 
impurity for a more positive set of identity markers (Adhikari 2002, 483). As 
Zimitri Erasmus (2001, 17) put it, Coloured identity remained mostly defined 
by what it was deemed to lack. Coloureds were not exactly considered a nation 
among nations, which prevented Coloured identity from informing an anti-​
apartheid nationalism (Petrus and Isaacs-​Martin 2012, 53). Those same con­
notations regarding Coloured identity did lead some to oppose apartheid in 
another way: by rejecting the notion altogether. It is important to note that 
most Coloureds continued to support assimilationist ideals, evident for 
instance through their overwhelming support for the National Party during the 
first post-​apartheid elections (Giliomee 1995, 222). Nevertheless, the rejection 
of Coloured identity constitutes an important break with the past; one that 
also laid the foundations for Khoisan revivalism.
Khoisan revivalism was indeed something that featured only at a later stage, 
after apartheid’s assimilationist policies were discontinued and the Khoisan 
past no longer overtly functioned as a reservoir of derogatory stereotypes. More 
importantly perhaps, Khoisan did not become an alternative identity during 
this time because, together with Coloured identity, ‘tribe’, ‘race’, and ‘ethnic­
ity’ were also rejected as colonial inventions intended to divide and rule the 
oppressed. What mattered most of all in the fight against minority rule was cre­
ating a coalition as broad as possible and not getting bogged down in debates 
over distinct historical trajectories. This reasoning was especially applied to 
Coloured identity, which was considered anathema to the anti-​apartheid 
struggle (Jackson and Robins 1999, 89). Slave descent denoted foreignness and

Chapter 2
was also not explicitly mobilized as an anti-​colonial identity (Coetzee 1998, 
209). Tellingly, the various ideologies and groups that called for the rejection of 
Coloured identity shared this consensus. Though earlier attempts by a pocket 
of Trotskyists to rally around class to oppose segregation had not enjoyed much 
support among Coloureds (Adhikari 2002, 25), Marxism remained a source of 
inspiration (see below). Non-​racialism, arguably subscribed to by the Non-​
European Unity Movement created in 1943, remained a powerful ideology in 
South Africa as well. However, notwithstanding important exceptions such as 
Neville Alexander, this ideology too was generally speaking unpopular among 
Coloureds, who seemed content on holding on to their relative privilege (ibid., 
9, 26). Adopting a more amorphous Pan-​Africanist identity, as called for by 
the Pan-​Africanist Congress (pac), and/​or a Black political identity, derived 
from Black Consciousness philosophy, were seemingly more popular choices. 
It is important to interject here that, as this book also shows, ideological pref­
erences or identities such as these do not necessarily contradict or exclude 
each other. In practice, they are able to coexist in their articulation.10 Having 
said that, I believe it is worthwhile to explore Black Consciousness as a source 
of ‘Coloured rejectionism’ in particular due to its strong influence on Khoisan 
revivalism –​ hence in part the choice of the title of this book (Lee 1998, 50; 
Brown and Deumert 2017, 575–​576; see Conclusion).
The Black Consciousness Movement (bcm) crystallized in the mid-​1960s 
in the wake of the imprisonment and exiling of the leadership of the anc and 
pac (Mngxitama, Alexander, and Gibson 2008, 4). bcm is commonly associ­
ated with Steve Biko and the South African Students’ Organization (saso), of 
which he was a founding member in 1968. Biko was a thorn in the side of the 
apartheid government and was assassinated at the hands of security services 
in 1977. Through his work for saso, his writings, speeches, and public pro­
tests, Biko inspired his followers to militantly oppose and defy the apartheid 
dispensation. Black Consciousness philosophy revoked ethnic and tribal 
identities based on skin pigmentation in favour of ‘Black’ as a form of polit­
ical subjectivity. Blackness was not non-​Whiteness but an ‘inward-​looking 
process’, an authentic consciousness that one had to attain in order to come 
to grips with centuries of psychological oppression and ‘false consciousness’ 
(Biko 2005 [1978], 21, 29; Gibson 2003, 1; Thomas 2014, 22–​23). Stimulated 
	10	
An interesting example from the Northern Cape in this regard is the Coloured Trotskyist 
pac politician Benny Alexander, who changed his name to !Khoisan x in 1994, drawing 
parallels with the case of Malcolm x in the US and combining Pan-​Africanism, Khoisan 
heritage, and Black Consciousness (Western 2001, 622; Lee 2003, 98; Brown and Deumert 
2017, 575–​576).

by Pan-​Africanist philosophy and similar movements abroad, particularly in 
the US, bcm promoted a way of life that celebrated and rejuvenated African 
culture through poetry, music. and various other forms of ‘protest art’, which 
flourished in the 1970s and 1980s (Biko 2005 [1978], 91; Minty 2006, 425). 
Black history was not inferior or backward, as colonialists portrayed it, but 
it had to be revised in order to produce African heroes in their own right. As 
Biko (2005 [1978], 29) himself put it: ‘A people without a positive history is 
like a vehicle without an engine’. Due to its wide appeal, bcm never operated 
as a bounded unit but rather inspired a broad coalition of politically like-​
minded individuals who opposed White-​minority rule (Van Kessel 2000, 18; 
Marabel and Peniel 2008, vii). Biko (2005 [1978], 38) was unequivocal in his 
belief that Coloureds could attain the same type of political subjectivity as 
Bantu-​speaking people. As Adhikari (2003, 182) notes, despite there being 
relatively few Coloured bcm activists, its ideological impact was significant 
among the younger generation in terms of questioning, reconfiguring, and 
discarding Coloured identity.
Such dynamics were amplified by the United Democratic Front (udf), 
which was officially launched in Mitchells Plain in the Cape Flats in 1983 in 
opposition to the so-​called Tricameral Parliament, where Whites, Coloureds, 
and Indians were given their own chambers (Johnson 2017, 19). Blacks did 
not qualify for the Parliament as they were still considered citizens of their 
homelands. Coloureds had been removed from the common voters’ role in 
1956 and this redesigned Parliament was presented by the apartheid gov­
ernment as a concession, aimed at increasing support among their ranks 
(Bickford-​Smith 2012, 146). Some politicians participated in this system, but 
their elections were boycotted by the vast of majority of Coloureds, who saw 
the Tricameral Parliament as an empty gesture (Walshe 1988, 342). While 
it originally profiled itself on this issue, the udf grew into the main anti-​
apartheid outfit. With other notable resistance collectives, such as the anc, 
banned or their functioning severely hampered, the udf grouped together 
local, regional, and national organizations, including churches and labour 
unions, under the aegis of non-​racialist opposition to apartheid (Johnson 
2017, 19). Its motto ‘udf Unites, Apartheid Divides’. Throughout the 1980s, the 
udf coordinated massive crowds to take to the streets to protest segregation 
and to call for the unbanning of the anc (Van Kessel 2000, 2). bcm activists 
also found a home with the udf after it too was banned in 1977 (Johnson 
2017, 19). A key figure was the udf President, the Coloured Reverend Allan 
Boesak, who used his oratory talents to spread a revolutionary blend of Black 
liberation theology and Black Consciousness (Van Kessel 2000, 16; Thomas 
2014, 27). Boesak and others drew on such ideologies to argue that Coloureds

were equally ‘Black’, despite receiving slightly preferential treatment under 
apartheid. As a result, it became common practice in these circles to speak 
of ‘so-​called coloureds’ (Yarwood 2006, 162). Discarding the identity alto­
gether became the unstated proviso that accompanied the realignment of 
Colouredness in the context of the anti-​apartheid struggle (Erasmus 2001, 
19). Ultimately this meant that, while the udf had become the most popular 
anti-​apartheid body in the country, it disbanded itself in 1991 to make way for 
the anc in the lead-​up to the democratic transition of 1994 (Van Kessel 2000, 
47; Suttner 2004, 694).
While there are important ways in which Khoisan revivalism differs from 
bcm and related ideologies, many of their core-​concepts and themes, such as 
‘false consciousness’ (which in turn clearly derives from Marxist scholarship) 
and the explicit quest for heroes in the past strongly influenced Khoisan reviv­
alism (see Conclusion). As I show in Chapter 4, various Khoisan revivalists are 
also reminiscent of their participation in the udf and in other anti-​apartheid 
organizations. People such as Jean Burgess (De Wet and Burgess 2011, 489) or 
Garth Erasmus (see Chapter 6) were for example avid bcm enthusiasts. It is also 
not a coincidence that two brothers of udf stalwart Allan Boesak, Reggie and 
Willa, became Khoisan revivalists after the end of apartheid (see Chapter 4). 
The list runs longer, but Yvette Abrahams and Vanessa Ludwig deserve a spe­
cial mention as they were one of the few who were explicitly inspired by the 
bcm to revive the Khoisan before 1994. In an interview, Abrahams (16/​07/​2019) 
explained that growing up with exiled parents in Sweden since she was six 
meant that there was no need for a taboo on Khoisan identity in her family, 
as was the case in South Africa. When Abrahams returned to the University 
of Cape Town to pursue her studies in 1983–​1984, she dropped out and moved 
to Mitchells Plain to become more immersed in the anti-​apartheid struggle. 
Here, together with Ludwig, she founded the bcm-​inspired collective Black 
Culture Lives!, which they renamed the !Hurikamma Cultural Movement in 1994 
(nb: Abrahams is the author of the scathing attack on Miscast). Ludwig, whose 
family was aligned to the pac, had always been aware of her Khoisan roots 
whilst growing up in District Six in Cape Town, but actively began research­
ing her family tree in the Cape Town archives in the 1980s: ‘The history books 
said I was extinct but here I am’ (Vanessa Ludwig, 19/​08/​2019). Through Black 
Culture Lives! Abrahams and Ludwig taught dance classes, spread ‘banned 
books’ (such as the work of Hosea Jaffe, see below), and carried out commu­
nity projects inspired by bcm-​ideology infused with references to the Khoisan.

danced, drew, wrote poems and read’ (en 2009c, 15).11 While the emphasis on 
‘roots’ was textbook bcm, Abrahams noted that the Khoisan element was not 
really mobilized by anyone else at the time, especially not to the same degree. 
To understand how this steadily changed in the run up to the end of apart­
heid, I need to turn to a parallel series of developments in academia regarding 
Khoisan historiography, and more specifically to the pivotal role of the histo­
rian Henry Bredekamp.
2.2.2	
Henry Bredekamp and Khoisan Revisionist Historiography
As Coloured identity was scrutinized during the anti-​apartheid struggle, aca­
demia did not remain unaffected. At the centre of this was the University of 
the Western Cape (uwc), the only university open to Coloureds. Established 
in 1959 with a mostly pro-​apartheid Afrikaner staff, uwc gradually allowed 
Coloured personnel (Messina 1995, 124). As anti-​apartheid efforts picked up 
pace, uwc eventually reinvented itself in 1987 as ‘the intellectual home of 
the left’ (Wolpe 1995, 286). Black Consciousness was tolerated by uwc’s first 
Coloured rector, Richard Van der Ross, and proliferated on campus through 
the sharing of photocopied (banned) books and political leaflets (Messina 
1995, 125; Thomas 2005,81, 87; 2014, 22). This put uwc on the map as a ‘struggle 
university’ and gave its students a reputation for being politically conscious 
and militant. Research conducted at the university’s Institute for Historical 
Research (ihr), founded in 1976, also gradually moved away from its original 
mission to become an ‘archive and research platform on “coloured” history, 
culture, and economic development’, poised to instil Coloureds with the his­
torical consciousness they believed to lack (Hattingh 1988, 41; Forte, Israel, and 
Witz 2017, 226). While initially reifying apartheid notions of Coloured identity 
through an exclusive focus on ‘Coloured history’ and ‘volkverhoudings’ [rela­
tions between populations], much of the ihr’s output from the 1980s onward 
was relatively subversive for its time in that it problematized a settler-​focused 
history of South Africa. A case in point is the publication of Groep sonder 
grense [Group without borders] by Hans Heese (1984), which laid bare the 
‘racial intermixture’ that characterized the early decades of the Cape Colony 
(Worden 2007, 5). Another example is the ihr’s weeklong seminar series on 
‘liberatory history’ in 1989, which deliberately coincided with Black History 
Month in the US (Henry Bredekamp 18/​12/​2018). Ultimately, however, the ihr’s 
use of racial registers and ambivalence towards Coloured identity became too

much to bear for the more radical and Marxist-​oriented members at uwc’s 
History Department (see below), who led the way in refashioning the institute 
into the Centre for Historical Research in 2006 (Worden 2007, 6; Forte, Israel, 
and Witz 2017, 226).
The relevance of the ihr’s mandate for the post-​apartheid era is not my 
concern here, but what tends to get lost in such discussions are the vital con­
tributions of its first Coloured faculty in revaluing Khoisan identity and cul­
ture in both the academic and public space. Indeed, many Khoisan revivalists 
refer to Henry Charles Bredekamp, as ‘the father of the Khoisan revival’ (Willa 
Boezak, 03/​05/​2018) or their guide for making them aware of their Khoisan 
roots (see e.g. De Jongh 2016, xiii). Due to Bredekamp’s significant impact on 
Khoisan revivalism’s genesis, it is worth elaborating on his career and intellec­
tual influences, much of which I reconstruct here from a series of interviews 
I conducted with him between 2018 and 2019.
Born on the old mission station of Genadendal, Bredekamp began his career 
as a school teacher (Henry Bredekamp, 30/​04/​2018). While taking part in an 
afternoon program at uwc for teachers to get their ba, Bredekamp was offered 
a position as lecturer-​researcher at the soon to be established ihr in 1975. He 
accepted and began contemplating a potential line of research. Bredekamp 
had always been aware of his Khoisan roots, but it was after encountering the 
work of the Canadian historian Richard Elphick while compiling a bibliogra­
phy in 1977/​1978 (Scholtz, Bredekamp, and Heese 1981) that he fully embraced 
Khoisan history as a subject in its own right: ‘Elphick opened something in 
my mind, it sparked something in me’ (Henry Bredekamp, 30/​04/​2018). While 
not without its critics (see e.g. Abrahams 1995), Elphick’s PhD dissertation 
(1972) and related monographs (Elphick 1977; 1985) became instant classics in 
the field of Khoisan history. Detailing the devastating impact of the decades 
preceding and following the establishment of the Cape Colony on the local 
population, Elphick’s pioneering arguments contrasted starkly with then-​pre­
vailing notions about the Khoisan. One reviewer praised Elphick for ‘at long 
last’ giving ‘the Khoikhoi their due measure of attention and sympathetic 
understanding’ (Hughes 1978, 65). Another commentator argued he ushered in 
‘a new generation of Khoikhoi studies’ (Smith 1990, 3). Elphick was an exponent 
of the Africanist school of historiography of the late 1960s and 1970s, which 
emphasized the agency of African actors (Falola 2011, 401). This approach was 
for a long time impossible or unpopular at South African history departments, 
which caused several intellectuals to pursue their academic careers in more 
favourable intellectual climates abroad, including Elphick’s supervisor at Yale 
University, Leonard Thompson (Elphick 2008, 555).

(Re)Thinking the ‘Khoisan’
89
According to Edward Cavanagh (2011, 1–​8), these ‘critical revisionists’ were 
responsible for carrying South African history forward from the 1960s onward 
(see also Dubow 2007, 69–​70). Whether at the hands of historians in South 
Africa or elsewhere, an innovative push towards recuperating and fronting 
African agency and class oppression became discernible in the anti-​apartheid 
inflected ‘radical’/​’revisionist’ historiography of the 1970s and 1980s (Cavanagh 
2011, 80; Kros 2017, 360). While these efforts were mainly directed at reinter­
preting South Africa’s mineral revolution and revealing the class-​struggle ori­
gins of apartheid, forgotten ‘histories from below’ during the voc period were 
also written concerning slaves, Khoisan, landless settlers, and so forth (Worden 
2007,3, 7, 9; 2009, 24). An interesting precursor in this regard is Three Hundred 
Years, authored by Cape Town-​born Non-​European Unity Movement member 
Hosea Jaffa, but published under the penname ‘Mnguni’ in 1952 (Saunders 
1986, 75). Jaffa offered an anti-​apartheid and Marxist-​inspired interpretation 
of South African history, seeking to ‘expose the process of the conquest, dis­
possession, enslavement, segregation and disfranchisement of the oppressed 
Non-​Europeans of South Africa, in order that [they] will understand better 
how to transform the status quo’ (Mnguni 1988 [1952], 13). In unprecedented 
fashion, the opening pages of Three Hundred Years condemn the exploitation 
and dispossession of the Khoisan, highlighting their resistance and agency, as 
well as the cruelty of colonialists. Though it stands out as an anti-​colonial text, 
it is not clear to what extent people were aware of its existence at the time (cf. 
Bredekamp 1991, 62). In the more well-​known circuits of academic historiogra­
phy, it is roughly two decades after Three Hundred Years that works of revision­
ism began to appear. Besides Elphick, prime examples in this regard are Shula 
Marks’ (1972) study of Khoisan resistance, Vertrees Malherbe’s (1979) paper on 
the Khoisan convert Cupido Kakkerlak, and Robert Ross’ (1976) history of the 
Griqua. To give an insight into the overtly revisionist stance of these authors 
without going into too much detail, notice how Marks sets the tone for her 
ground-​breaking paper:
The Khoisan […] have on the whole had a bad press from historians 
[…] Jan van Riebeeck […] was neither the first nor the last to refer to 
the Hottentots as ‘a dull, stupid, lazy, stinking nation’ –​ who were, at the 
same time, ‘bold, thievish and not to be trusted’. Stereotypes of the San or 
Bushmen as ‘incorrigible banditti’, ‘uneducable’ and ‘unassimilable’ also 
abound in the literature of South Africa.

Chapter 2
Full-​frontal assaults on remnants of old-​school Khoisan historiography 
such as these captivated Bredekamp. On that note, Elphick not only inspired 
him through his work, but did so in person as well. During our conversations, 
Bredekamp (30/​04/​2018) recalled with fondness how he met Elphick at an 
event in the Whites-​only suburb of Rondebosch in 1980. Classified Coloured, 
Bredekamp was in theory barred from entering, but was allowed inside, and 
managed to set up an appointment with Elphick. Organizing a public meet­
ing between Whites and non-​Whites was a complicated affair at the time, as 
restaurants or pubs were out of the question. They settled on the Compagny’s 
Gardens in central Cape Town, where they enjoyed a picnic on one of the pub­
lic benches. Elphick told Bredekamp he needed to be ‘exposed’ to a different 
intellectual climate, free from apartheid ideology. This ultimately culminated 
in Bredekamp pursuing an ma in Liberal Studies in 1981–​1982 at Wesleyan 
University on a Fulbright scholarship, where Elphick was based (Henry 
Bredekamp, 02/​08/​2019). When he returned to the ihr in 1983, no one was 
working on Khoisan history, at least not to the extent and in the way that he 
was about to do: ‘I spoke of Khoikhoi, San or Khoisan whereas most spoke 
about Hottentots and Boesman. They teased me by calling me ou-​Khoikhoi 
[old Khoikhoi]’ (Henry Bredekamp, 03/​07/​2018). Bredekamp made a con­
scious decision not to pursue a PhD but to make ‘modest contributions’ in the 
form of publications in Afrikaans and English that would appeal to ordinary 
Coloureds’ sense of ancestral heritage (Henry Bredekamp, 21/​05/​2018; see 
also Bredekamp 1992, 54–​55). The mounting opposition to apartheid inspired 
Bredekamp to focus on historical Khoisan figures and their resistance to, and 
interactions with, European settlers (Henry Bredekamp, 21/​05/​2018). The 
publication of his 1979 ma thesis (Bredekamp 1979b) in 1982 under the telling 
title Van veeverskaffers tot veewagters [from cattle suppliers to cattle herders] 
(Bredekamp 1982) bears witness to his revisionism, but examples abound in 
his other work as well (see e.g. Bredekamp 1979a; 1980; 1981; 1987; 1988; 1991). 
There is no need to discuss these publications in detail. What is key is that their 
focus on topics such as the resistance tactics of the Khoisan or the invalidity of 
colonial treaties reveal what one reviewer described as ‘’n besondere simpatie 
vir die inboorlingroepe [a surprising sympathy towards the indigenous people]’ 
(Hattingh 1988, 55) and another one as a ‘gebalanseerde benadering [balanced 
approach]’ that does away with common stereotypes (Lubbe 1983, 78).
As much as Khoisan revisionist historiography broke with tradition by 
being ‘balanced’ and ‘sympathetic’, its effects on Khoisan revivalism should 
not be overstated. Khoisan resistance was certainly explored and the con­
cept ‘Khoisan’ was endorsed along the way because the Khoikhoi and San 
were deemed to have experienced colonialism in similar ways (see Marks

1972, 57, 60; Bredekamp 1991, 65; Wright 1996, 16). However, as Michael Besten 
(2011a, 71) notes, many of these authors implicitly or explicitly subscribed to 
the notion that the Khoisan were extinct or assimilated into oblivion. Marks 
(1972, 55) for instance wrote that the Khoisan had ‘all but disappeared […] at 
least in their earlier guise’; they ‘literally acculturated themselves into the Cape 
Coloured population’ (Marks 1981, 20). In a series of polemics between archae­
ologists and anthropologists in the 1980s and 1990s known as the ‘Kalahari 
Debates’, the degree to which, and in what guise, San culture and identity had 
persisted throughout centuries was likewise ferociously contested (Wright and 
Weintroub 2014, 736). One side claimed they had remained in relative isola­
tion and retained their ‘pre-​historic’ lifestyle, while the other camp argued that 
they needed to be ‘historicized’ in order to lay bare various forms of outside 
influence (Wilmsen 1989, 10; Douglas 1997, 53; Barnard 2007, 97–​111). To varying 
extents this type of language concerning continuity and authenticity lives on 
in academic publications (see e.g. Steyn 1990), and as this book will continu­
ously confirm, outside of academia as well. A second line of criticism levelled 
at Khoisan revisionist scholarship has to do with the extent to which it effec­
tively dispelled stereotypes. While there is consensus that it did (Smith 1983, 
44, Besten 2011a, 67; Øvernes 2019, 152–​193), Abrahams argued that it in effect 
reproduced them (Abrahams 1994, 76; see also Abrahams 2000). As I show in 
later chapters, she is mainly concerned here with gender and traditional lead­
ership. Anticipating Khoisan revivalism, Abrahams warned that if historiogra­
phy did not purge itself of such stereotypes, Khoisan descendants would reject 
it and look elsewhere for the historiography they deserve (Abrahams 1994,77; 
1995, 22).
This brings me to a final related point. It is telling how the origins of Khoisan 
revisionist historiography are located abroad and steadily worked their way 
into South African academia through figures such as Bredekamp. However, as 
I show in the next section, it is only in the run-​up to a large scale conference on 
Khoisan identities in Cape Town that such academic debates definitively pen­
etrated the public sphere and began enticing Coloureds to become Khoisan 
revivalists.
2.2.3	
Towards a New Khoisan Agenda in the Post-​apartheid Era
Until the 1997 edition, which I work my way towards in this section, Khoisan 
studies conferences were habitually held abroad. Consequently, Bredekamp 
found himself attending his first Khoisan-​related conference in Tutzing, 
Germany, in 1994 (Henry Bredekamp, 21/​05/​2018). The gathering had been 
instigated to celebrate and debate the contributions of Wilhelm Bleek (see 
above). What struck Bredekamp were not so much the presentations at the

Chapter 2
conference but the fact that he was the only African in attendance at an event 
that was ostensibly about people like him. This led him to make an off-​the-​cuff 
intervention during the plenary session. The anthropologist Richard Lee was 
struck by Bredekamp’s heartfelt plea to the audience:
This meeting has a great deal of significance for me because I am a 
Khoisan person. There are millions of South Africans like me who trace 
their ancestry back to the Khoi and the San peoples. These are our histo­
ries our languages you are discussing. Under Apartheid we lost much of 
our culture. Now we want to work closely with you in recovering our past 
and our traditions.
lee 2003, 96
As Lee (ibid.) recalls, Bredekamp’s words ‘energized the meeting’ and ‘gave 
a new lease on life to the field of Khoisan studies’. Indeed, Bredekamp was 
overwhelmed by the support he received, particularly by leading scholars in 
the field such as Megan Biesele, Sidsel Saugestad, Jeanette Deacon, and Robert 
Ross. They agreed that Khoisan studies was in for some overdue introspec­
tion and urged him to organize the following edition of the conference not 
in Austin, as originally planned, but in South Africa (Henry Bredekamp, 21/​
05/​2018). After getting the green light from the rector of uwc and the new 
head of the ihr, Colin Bundy, Bredekamp procured funding for the confer­
ence through Lee, who also joined the organizing committee. Financial sup­
port trickled in from other foreign and national sponsors, including the South 
African government (see Bank 1998a). Noted academics such as archaeologists 
John Parkington and Andrew Smith helped organize the conference and lent it 
academic credence. As the absence of Khoisan in Tutzing had been a source of 
consternation for Bredekamp, the organizing committee invited Khoisan from 
all over Southern Africa to attend this time around. The uncomfortable fall­
out from the Miscast exhibition in 1996 created even more impetus to do so.12 
Khoisan representatives from Botswana and Namibia attended the conference 
	12	
When I mentioned to Bredekamp that I had come across a conference report regarding 
a meeting that took place in Pretoria in September 1996 entitled ‘The Khoisan Peoples of 
South Africa’, this was news to him. This is all the more striking as the gathering reportedly 
delivered ‘[a]‌ clear message […] that the Khoisan are not some extinct group of people 
who disappeared after the arrival of the Europeans, but that their descendants are still 
to be found […] in modern South Africa’ (Viljoen 1996, 144). Unfortunately, to my knowl­
edge, there are no published conference proceedings. Nor have I been able to find any 
further information about this gathering.

(Re)Thinking the ‘Khoisan’
93
(see Chapter 3), but in the remainder of this chapter I want to single out two 
South African delegates who sat on the organizing committee and had a more 
direct bearing on the unfolding of Khoisan revivalism in Cape Town.
The first is Cecil Le Fleur, grandson of a.a.s. Le Fleur and chairman of the 
Executive Council of the gnc, who was suggested for the organizing commit­
tee by Jeanette Deacon (Henry Bredekamp, 21/​05/​2018). As the collective with 
arguably the strongest, if complicated, claim to continuity with the past and 
the largest membership base (Schweitzer 2015, 141), the gnc was a natural pick. 
Griqua politics had run somewhat out of steam after the definitive categoriza­
tion of the Griqua as Coloured under apartheid (see above). However, Griqua 
aspirations were given a new lease on life with the end of White-​minority rule 
in sight. On the one hand, Griqua representatives were not part of the so-​called 
codesa (Convention of Democratic South Africa) debates of the early 1990s. 
Various stakeholders presented their vision for a post-​apartheid South Africa 
and negotiated the way forward during these heated deliberations. The gnc’s 
request for a seat at the negotiating table, motivated primarily by the need 
to discuss matters of land in Griqualand-​West, received no response (Willa 
Boezak, 03/​05/​2018; Cecil Le Fleur, 10/​07/​2019; see also sahrc 2018, 56). While 
the burning issue of Zulu separatism was firmly on the agenda, the Griqua’s dis­
possession and political aspirations were not (Muthien and Khosa 1995, 2). On 
the other hand, one author claims it was as a result of pressure from the gnc 
that the South African census included an option ‘Other’ from 1996 onward 
(Christopher 2009, 107). Be that as it may, Griqua issues ranked low on the list 
of priorities for those who were busy designing the new South Africa. The end 
of apartheid brought with it new venues for political pressure, for instance in 
the domain of the recognition of traditional leadership, which I come back to 
in the following chapter, but the democratic transition of 1994 did not bring 
about the de facto accommodation of Griqua grievances. A highly significant 
shift in Griqua discourse occurred in the face of this disappointment, one that 
perhaps had the most enduring impact on Khoisan revivalism as a whole: their 
redefinition as indigenous people.
The concept of indigenous people was foreign to South African politics up to 
that point, and it is telling that it made its way to the Griqua via an outside fig­
ure. Mansell Upham, a lawyer classified White but who also claimed Khoikhoi 
descent, joined the gnc as an advisor between 1994 and 1998 (Schweitzer 2015, 
157–​159). Upham had previously worked for the South African embassy in 
Japan, where he took notice of the Ainu, the country’s indigenous people. Upon 
returning to South Africa, he advised the Griqua to identify as indigenes to 
boost their struggle for land and self-​determination. With the United Nations’ 
proclamation of the World Decade on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in

Chapter 2
1994, it indeed increased the visibility of Griqua grievances, particularly in the 
international arena. With the assistance of Upham, a gnc delegation attended 
a session of the United Nations-​affiliated International Working Group on 
Indigenous Affairs (iwgia) in Geneva in 1995 and they have continued doing 
so since (ibid.). The Griqua were not the only Khoisan lobbying at the UN in 
order to put pressure on the South African government during this time. San 
who had been relocated to the Schmidtsdrift army base in 1990 after fighting 
for the South African Defence Force in Namibia also made several appearances 
at the iwgia (Douglas 1997, 45, 48). Together with other San representatives, 
the Schmidtsdrift community formed the Windhoek-​based Working Group of 
Indigenous Minorities of Southern Africa (wimsa) in 1995, a body aimed at 
protecting San rights in the region (Douglas 1997, 57). The South African San 
Institute (sasi) was in turn created in 1996 as a wimsa affiliate and focused 
specifically on South Africa. A key figure in sasi is the Canadian socio-​lin­
guist Nigel Crawhall. Not unlike what Upham did for the Griqua, Crawhall was 
instrumental in campaigning for the linguistic and resource rights of the San in 
international circles (Crawhall 1999; Le Fleur 2001, 85). This activist conviction 
made Crawhall decide to assist with organizing the 1997 conference.
In this fashion, Bredekamp and his colleagues on the organizing com­
mittee brought together Khoisan representatives and spokespeople from all 
corners of the subcontinent. As I show in the next chapter, there was some 
disagreement over what the focus of the conference ought to be and who could 
attend. Much of this related to the second member of the organizing commit­
tee I want to highlight: Joseph Little. Little, who is arguably the first Khoisan 
revivalist and certainly qualifies as the progenitor of Khoisan identity politics, 
is somewhat of an enigmatic figure, prone to giving different accounts of his 
background and motivations for becoming involved with Khoisan issues. Little 
told a reporter from the Mail & Guardian in 1997 that his father had ‘taught us 
to be proud of our Khoi bloodline’.13 He went on to explain that he perused var­
ious archives in Europe over the last 15 years in his search for his Khoisan roots. 
Without specifying how he got his information, Duane Jethro (2017, 354) notes 
instead that Little lived and worked in Europe in the 1980s and that it was ‘in 
the libraries of England’ that he ‘rediscovered’ his indigenous roots. Access to 
historical works, Jethro argues, helped him substantiate his lack of ‘concrete 
tenets of indigeneity such as blood ties, language, religion and established 
cultural tradition’. When I interviewed Little, I received yet another version of

these events. To me, Little (17/​05/​2018) spoke of his time in Ireland in 1984 
in terms of finding out more about his Irish roots. He ‘lost interest’ in this 
part of the family tree and decided to look more closely at his grandmother 
on his father’s side when he came back to South Africa. He pieced together 
to his surprise that she was of Khoikhoi descent, more specifically from the 
Chainouqua tribe, and that she had married an Irish man with the surname 
Little (Joseph Little, 08/​05/​2018). This finding intrigued Little and made him 
curious to discover as much as possible about the Khoisan. He had always been 
puzzled by the fact that some in his family had been classified White but oth­
ers Coloured. In the context of the Group Areas Act, members of the family 
who were classified Coloured were forcibly removed from Plumstead to Grassy 
Park, a Coloureds-​only suburb of Cape Town. Irish and Scottish ancestry was 
the only recognized lineage in Little’s family. As a result, some family mem­
bers still resent him for exploring the Khoikhoi roots of his father’s side of the 
family. Contrary to Jethro’s account, Little emphasized his purpoted genetic 
descent during my two interviews with him (see Chapter 3).
Jethro’s observation regarding Little’s use of historical and academic mate­
rials does ring true to my experiences, however. Indeed, in preparation for our 
first interview, Little had laid out a series of worn-​out books across the coffee 
table as reference points for the various arguments and claims he was about to 
make. An avid reader with an impressive memory, Little frequently cited pas­
sages from travellers’ accounts or suggested reading materials to me with ease 
during our conversations. As a lecturer in automotive engineering at the Cape 
Peninsula University of Technology, Little had exceptional access to libraries 
containing such research at the time. He was known as a man who had ‘doc­
uments, books and papers’ and was eager to share them with anyone looking 
for information (Øvernes 2019, 45; see Chapter 3 and Four). As Little explained, 
most did not know about the existence of such books, or could not access them 
because they were classified Coloured or did not have the financial means. It 
is important to note therefore that Little was also in touch with other academ­
ics who supplied him with materials and sources. Jeanette Deacon gave him a 
reprinted edition of Donald Moodie’s The Record, a collection of sources relat­
ing to the early years of voc rule, originally compiled in 1838 (Janette Deacon, 
06/​08/​2019). That copy of The Record appeared on the day of our interview 
on the coffee table alongside some of his other cherished sources of inspira­
tion: the aforementioned work of Elphick, Rowland Raven-​Hart’s collection of 
sources, Before van Riebeeck (1967), Gabriel Stefanus Nienaber’s Khoekhoense 
Stamname (1989), and Tony Simpson’s Indigenous Heritage and self-​determi­
nation (1997). One of his favourite texts is Wilfred Haacke and Eliphas Eiseb’s 
dictionary Khoekhoegowab-​English/​English-​Khoekhoegowab (1999). Reviving

Chapter 2
Khoekhoegowab remains central for Little, as he felt it was the most authentic 
marker of indigenous authenticity:
You are identified by a language […] A Coloured does not speak 
Coloured, he speaks English or Afrikaans, he borrows language […] The 
word Coloured does not exist in the Constitution […] it does mention 
language, which put me on course to find our language […] when I found 
the language I wanted to name the people after it: Khoekhoegowab.
joseph little, 17/​05/​2018
This quote gives an insight into what propelled Little to align his fascination 
with the Khoisan with his activism for people classified Coloured, which had 
previously found expression in a brief career as city politician (Lee 2006, 
456). While I am not entirely certain what Little was getting at when weaving 
together references to the 1996 Constitution of South Africa, Coloured iden­
tity, and Khoekhoegowab, he was clearly stressing that Coloureds’ forgotten 
Khoisan ancestry was their salvation from marginalization. To further these 
ambitions, Little quit his job and poured his savings into the Cape Cultural 
Heritage Development Council (cchdc), a non-​profit organization he set up 
in August 1996 in the wake of Miscast (Besten 2006, 288). Little told the afore­
mentioned Mail & Guardian journalist that he created the cchdc ‘to foster 
unity among historically Coloured people and give them pride in their origin 
[and] in response to the government’s affirmative action policies: under the pre­
vious dispensation we weren’t white enough, with the next we weren’t brown 
enough […] Black people have no respect for us because we have no ancestral 
roots’.14 Little was gesturing at Black Economic Empowerment (bee), a policy 
aimed at tackling skewed employment patterns as a result of segregation but 
often judged by Coloureds to be unfairly privileging Blacks (see Chapter 5). 
By making the connection between Coloured identity and the Khoisan, Little 
had effectively come up with a third option for those seeking to re-​invent their 
identities without emphasising White or Black ancestry. The ‘December First 
Movement’ –​ referring to the date of the abolition of slavery in South Africa in 
1834 –​ began emphasizing the history of slavery among Coloureds in 1996, at 
the same time that Little began avidly promoting Khoisan ancestry. However, 
the movement’s traction is dwarfed by that which Khoisan revivalism courted

from the onset, perhaps due to the fact that slavery was not associated with 
indigeneity (cf. Worden 2009, 28; see also Ruiters 2009, 118–​120).
While the ccdhc thus clearly functioned as a way to advance a form of 
Coloured nationalism and flirted with racialized language in the process, I show 
in the next chapter how Little’s views on these matters as well as the opera­
tions of the cchdc are much more complex than what the Mail & Guardian 
article conveys. When Deacon suggested Little for the organizing committee, 
Bredekamp knew what he was in for. By that time Little was already openly 
flirting with the idea of appointing ‘chiefs’, something Bredekamp was always 
wary of. At the same time, when he met Little in person he picked up on his 
charisma, his relative prominence among Coloureds, and his insatiable appe­
tite for Khoisan history (Henry Bredekamp, 21/​05/​2018). The Griqua and var­
ious other Khoisan representatives were already on board, and Bredekamp 
suspected Little could bring an original contribution to the conference with 
his focus on Khoisan identity in the Cape (Henry Bredekamp, 03/​07/​2018). As 
I show in the next chapter, Bredekamp would get more than he bargained for 
as Little exceeded all expectations at the 1997 conference and its aftermath.

The Political Accommodation and Diversification 
of Post-​apartheid Khoisan Revivalism
I used to see this kind of thing as an invention, a calculated manipu­
lation motivated by another agenda, whether it be land acquisition, 
political representation, jobs or an income […] In part it is a cre­
ation, yet that does not mean the participants do not feel strongly 
about these ideas. One must acknowledge many populations draw 
on history to create a sense of identity and they have every right to 
do so […] Within living memory people have experienced negative 
connotations of being called hotnot and bushmen […] That hurt 
is still with them. This is a healing thing. It has a positive aspect. 
But the leaders of such groups are much more conscious and cal­
culating about the way they manipulate symbols than the rank and 
file who see images that resonate with them –​ and that’s one of the 
dangers.

The Political Accommodation and Diversification

Khoisan studies, Little and his entourage presented somewhat of an anomaly. 
Born and bred in Cape Town but dressed for the occasion in a toga refash­
ioned into a faux-​leopard skin kaross [mantle] (Joseph Little, 17/​05/​2018), the 
flamboyant and charismatic Little did not conform to commonly held views 
about where Khoisan reside and how they practice culture. Richard Lee (2006, 
456), whose work focused on Namibia and Botswana, felt Eric Hobsbawn and 
Terrance Ranger ‘would have had a field day’ at the conference; in reference 
to their famous thesis on the invention of tradition (see Introduction). Lee 
was struck by the ceremonial swearing-​in of traditional leaders from tribes 
that had been dissolved in the 17th and 18th centuries: ‘members of the audi­
ence were called to the podium where they donned a highly eclectic mix of 
regalia and announced […] who they were, what clan they were represent­
ing, and what Khoi name they were adopting’. Little became ‘Chief of the 
Hamcumqua’, although he later spoke of the ‘Chainoqua’, which for him refers 
to the same people (Besten 2006, 294–​295). The inductees held ‘impassioned 
speeches’ about forgotten Khoisan ‘heroes’ and the need to reclaim Khoisan 
heritage (Lee and Hitchcock 2001, 272). Revivalist themes also dominated 
the public events prior to the scientific part of the conference, including 
parades and the ritual slaughter of a goat at Iziko Museum. There was also 
an excursion to Robben Island for conference delegates. Famous for impris­
oning Nelson Mandela for 18 years, Little ‘with documentary filmmakers in 
tow’ instead stressed how Robben Island’s first prisoner was the largely for­
gotten 17th century Khoisan chief Autshumato, ‘King of Robben Island’ (Lee 
and Hitchcock 2001, 272; Lee 2006, 456).2 By emphasizing ‘a highly eclectic 
mix of regalia’, ‘the invention of tradition’ or Little’s overall behaviour at the 
1997 conference, Lee was not being condescending. Rather, like Boonzaier, he 
struggled to make sense of budding expressions of Khoisan revivalism in a 
drastically altered conference setting.
While more of an intellectual curiosity to academics, Little’s brand of 
Khoisan revivalism also did not sit well with some of the other stakeholders 
of the 1997 conference. Little controversially borrowed from, and added to, 
various cultural influences, often coupled with politically charged aspira­
tions to traditional leadership roles. He improvised a new kind of overarch­
ing Khoisan identity, but associating with stereotypical imagery and sharing 
a platform with more established Khoisan communities such as the Griqua 
or the San also boosted his credentials as an authentic Khoisan spokesper­
son (see also Jethro 2017, 357). Little was for instance adamant about having

native speakers of Khoisan languages at the conference ‘so that people could 
know our language was not dead and that we are not dead’ (Joseph Little, 
08/​05/​2018). Henry Bredekamp, the driving force behind the conference, 
recalls how some prominent advocates for San rights were put off by Little’s 
Khoisan revivalism (Henry Bredekamp, 11/​12/​2018). To them, Khoisan reviv­
alism smacked of opportunism, risked detracting attention from the cause 
of the San, and above all muddied their efforts at image-​building (Henry 
Bredekamp, 21/​05/​2018; see Chapter 7).3 According to Michael Besten (2006, 
297), sasi was ‘very averse’ to alliances with Khoisan revivalists because they 
‘lacked the marketable primordial sociocultural attributes and the associ­
ation with ultra-​marginality that appealed to international donors’. Some 
San representatives also clashed with the Griqua for similar reasons (Henry 
Bredekamp, 10/​07/​2019). As I show below, some Griqua were in turn initially 
reluctant to associate with Khoisan revivalists like Little, adding further 
complexity to the struggle over Khoisan representation in the post-​apartheid 
era (Besten 2006, 282). Griqua representatives, particularly from the Griqua 
National Conference (gnc), formed the other major block of Khoisan dele­
gates at the conference (Bank 1998b, 1). Like Little, they capitalized on the 
occasion to showcase their culture. An improvised traditional dwelling that 
was loosely modelled on a Nama-​styled matjieshuis was for example erected 
in the courtyard of the South African Cultural History Museum, where a re-​
enacted initiation ritual of a young girl into womanhood was staged for the 
audience (Davison and Klinghardt 1997, 190–​191). The Griqua national choir 
also officially opened the conference with their rendition of, among others, 
the gnc anthem and the new South African national anthem, Nkosi Sikelel’ 
iAfrika.
As per design, the 62 Khoisan delegates outnumbered academics at the 1997 
conference (Bank 1998b, 1). Together with the political overtones and cultural 
performances, this made it a drastically different affair from previous editions. 
In retrospect, the preceding gathering in Germany had indeed perhaps been 
the last ‘colonialist conference’ (Ross 1997a, 154). The academic debates at the 
1997 edition still revolved around rather conventional topics in Khoisan stud­
ies (cf. Bank 1998a), but they were overshadowed by the dynamics outlined 
above; making the 1997 edition according to Robert Ross (1997a, 154) ‘at once 
academic symposium, cultural manifestation and political forum’. He was not 
only referring to intra-​Khoisan tensions, but also to the calls for reparations 
	3	 Although the term’s precise origins remain unclear, Little argues that Nigel Crawhall began 
referring to him as a ‘revivalist’ to create conceptual distance between him and the San

and restitution that were made by various Khoisan delegates. South Africa’s 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission (trc) was still in full-​swing at the 
time. Created in 1995, the trc held public hearings and investigations across 
the country until 1998. Although its mandate concerns the apartheid-​era and 
Khoisan grievances therefore largely fell outside of its scope, the trc placed 
historical justice firmly on everyone’s minds. A land reform process ran paral­
lel to the trc with the aim of redressing dispossession and skewed property 
ownership patterns along racial lines (see below). Not surprisingly therefore, 
calls for land, indigenous rights and recognition pervaded the 1997 confer­
ence (Davison and Klinghardt 1997, 190–​191). For Ross (1997a, 154), these were 
in reality veiled attempts to make presenters complicit and uncomfortable 
and tended to railroad academic sessions as a result. By claiming authorship 
and ownership of what was written and said about them in this fashion, if 
need be at the expense of academics, the Khoisan sought to embolden and 
legitimate their political ambitions. Indeed, Ross appreciated that the ‘emer­
gent Khoisan consciousness from within the Coloured community’ may well 
generate ‘important psychological effects’, but he also flagged the ‘disquiet­
ing’ presence of self-​proclaimed Khoisan ‘traditional leaders’ (ibid., 155). 
Others were more enthusiastic about the prospects of increased interactions 
between Khoisan and academics, as this could lead to greater access of aca­
demic materials (Besten 2006, 320), address the lack of ‘dignity and respect’ 
in relation to research ethics (Ngakaeaja 1998, 31) and reset ‘the relationship 
between popular participant and academic knowledge’ more generally (Bank 
1998a, 41).
By empowering Khoisan agency in the academic debates that concerned 
them, the 1997 conference constitutes the first major public affirmation of 
Khoisan revivalism and its political ambitions. More than ever before, the 
Khoisan demanded to no longer be treated as passive objects of study, and 
asserted themselves as contemporary individuals in need of political rec­
ognition and cultural redemption. Bredekamp was quite clear about what 
this meant when he stated in his opening remarks that ‘it is a beginning of 
a battle for identity in the new South Africa and in Southern Africa’ (ibid., 
14). Though Khoisan revivalism is more complex (see Chapter 7), the prin­
ciple foe in this ‘battle’ is the Khoisan extinction discourse I discussed in 
the preceding chapter. Little understood as much when he likened the 1997 
conference to the rebirth of ‘a proud and honourable nation’ (Bank 1998a, 
7). In his speech, Lionel Mtshali, then Minister Arts, Culture, Science and 
Technology, concurred: ‘one of the biggest problems faced by the Khoisan is 
the way they are seen as static or as nearing extinction’ (ibid., 17). In his key­
note address, the retired professor of anatomy and human biology Phillip

Chapter 3
Tobias (1998) made similar observations when he debunked common mis­
conceptions about the Khoisan. However, as the concerns of critics showed, 
the Khoisan not merely asserted their vitality, they also voiced various 
entitlement claims, especially concerning land and the official recognition 
of traditional leadership; two topics that continue to dominate Khoisan 
politics.
There is of course much more to Khoisan revivalism than ‘politics’ but it 
is imperative to appreciate how the various legislative and political develop­
ments form the backdrop to the expressions of Khoisan revivalism and the 
divergent articulations of indigeneity I detail in Part 2. I organize this chap­
ter around a non-​exhaustive selection of key events and actors that have 
shaped Khoisan revivalism’s diversification and political accommodation 
in the post-​apartheid era, particularly in Cape Town. Some of this has been 
covered by others (Bredekamp 2001, 199; Fauvelle-​Aymar 2006, 129; Besten 
2011b), but they have not yet been strung together in chronological fashion. 
I acknowledge that my text might suffer from important omissions; future 
authors might place different emphases, or focus on other events and actors 
altogether (see Chapter 1). I lean more towards the descriptive side here, but 
revisit policies and government standpoints in more analytical fashion in the 
Conclusion. The first subchapter explores how Khoisan revivalism grew more 
prominent, both numerically and politically, in the wake of the 1997 confer­
ence when a collective of intellectuals under Little’s auspices began publicly 
self-​identifying as Khoisan and drawing on the global indigenous rights move­
ment to initiate institutionalised demands for recognition from the state, par­
ticularly with regards to Khoisan traditional leadership. After the follow-​up 
conference in 2001, Khoisan revivalism momentarily peaked in terms of influ­
ence with the reburial of Sarah Baartman in 2002 and the visit of the United 
Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples in 2005. The 
subsequent period of relative stagnation ends around 2012, where the second 
subchapter picks up the argument. Combined with more assertive articula­
tions of Khoisan indigeneity and direct-​action approaches, significant accel­
erations in land and traditional leadership politics mark the start of a more 
militant and (social)media infused phase of Khoisan revivalism. I end with an 
overview of the status-​quo and the passing of the Traditional and Khoi-​San 
Leadership Act (tkla) in 2019, which potentially heralds a new transforma­
tion of Khoisan politics.

Khoisan Identity (1997–​2012)
3.1.1	
From the Cape Cultural Heritage Development Council to the 
National Khoisan Council: Traditional Leadership and Indigenous 
Rights on the Agenda
As I noted in the previous chapter, while their bid to take part in the codesa 
negotiations was unsuccessful, the Griqua kept pressure on the anc-​govern­
ment to acknowledge their political aspirations. In 1995, gnc Paramount Chief 
a.a.s Le Fleur ii held several meetings with President Nelson Mandela, who 
later visited Griquatown and met with representatives in Genadendal (Besten 
2006, 274; Bredekamp 2001, 204). The gnc was also part of a delegation of 
‘about twenty representatives of Griqua, Nama and San communities’ that 
pleaded with the Department of Constitutional Development to recognize 
their traditional leaders in 1995 (Besten 2006, 274). The Department responded 
with an ‘investigation of the history, social structure and leadership of the 
Griqua community’ in 1997 (Bredekamp 2001, 204). Together with the gnc’s 
lobbying at the United Nations (see Chapter 2), this investigation, which is not 
publicly available, formed the rationale for the National Griqua Forum (ngf), 
established in July that same year as a body to liaise with the government 
on how best to constitutionally accommodate the concerns of ‘indigenous 
minorities’ in South Africa (Besten 2006, 277). According to Bredekamp (2015, 
11), the decision to create the ngf was taken during a closed-​door meeting of 
Department officials and Griqua representatives just days before the 1997 con­
ference. In attending the conference, networking among the various Khoisan 
delegates present and learning about the global indigenous rights movement, 
those same officials were exposed to non-​Griqua related issues as well, not 
least those put forward by Little’s group, which eventually made them pursue 
a different policy route.
As mentioned earlier, Joseph Little created the Cape Cultural Heritage 
Development Council (cchdc) in 1996 as a non-​profit organization to recruit 
allies in his quest to revive Khoisan identity and culture.4 As illustrated by the 
abovementioned ceremony, Little bestowed traditional leadership titles to cer­
tain cchdc members in reference to historical tribes he discovered during 
	4	 Documents detailing cchdc meetings and activities reportedly reside in Oudtshoorn with 
Poem Mooney, one of its members in Oudtshoorn. Attempts to access this information were 
ultimately unsuccessful. It also remains unclear what exactly the distinction is between the 
cchdc and the Cape Cultural Heritage Development Organization (cchdo). As the latter is 
not frequently mentioned, I speak mainly of the ccdhc.

his perusal of the literature, particularly Elphick’s historical maps, Nienaber’s 
etymological study of Khoisan tribal names, or the 17th century Daghregister 
[diary] kept by van Riebeeck (Joseph Little, 08/​05/​2018). To visualize the cch­
dc’s tribal structure, Little drew up a map by hand, indicating the historical 
territories the revived tribes presided over with the help of colour codes. Little 
did not claim that the men and women heading the revived tribes were directly 
related to the Khoisan of the voc era, but rather that their families hailed from 
the same historical areas, and that they were fully committed to learning and 
reviving as much as they could about the tribe they identified with. At the 
same time, Little occasionally implied he was from noble pedigree, particularly 
by referring to his grandmother as a member of a ‘royal tribe’.5 Much about 
these cchdc appointed traditional leaders remains unknown, including how 
many followers they had and whether salaries were ever paid –​ something 
Little vehemently denies. The cchdc reportedly only received small scale 
donations (Basil Coetzee, 06/​05/​2018), but one source mentions that Little’s 
Chainouquas charged membership fees (Bredekamp and Olivier 2000, 81). It 
is also not entirely clear if the traditional leaders appointed at the 1997 confer­
ence are the same who appeared later on.
Among the names that were mentioned to me as cchdc affiliates are Sharon 
Leng, John Cloete, Margareth Coetzee, Moira Daya, John Jansen, Nicholas de 
Weer, Willa Boezak, George Brink, Ron Martin, Poem Mooney, Priscilla De 
Wet, Harleen Sasman, and Basil Coetzee –​ many of whom I did not manage to 
contact and seemed to no longer be publicly involved in Khoisan revivalism. 
Besten (2006, 287) describes the cchdc as an organic network of prominent 
Coloured intellectuals, mainly from the Western and Eastern Cape provinces 
(see also Crawhall 2002, 422). Members such as Willa Boezak and George Brink 
hold PhDs and others such as Little were lecturers at universities. Priscilla De 
Wet studied history and anthropology at uwc and also graduated with an 
ma in Indigenous Studies at Tromsø University, Norway (De Wet 2011). Basil 
Coetzee (06/​05/​2018; 25/​04/​2018), an amateur historian and organic intellec­
tual of repute within the Coloured community of Mitchells Plain, explained 
to me that the cchdc was the ‘vehicle that drove Cape Khoi resurgence’ as a 
result of friends approaching other friends and family.6 Coetzee himself met 
Little by coincidence in 1998, when he delivered a speech on Coloured identity 
and indigenous rights at Pollsmoor prison in Cape Town, where Coetzee had

been working for several years. In his part-​history, part-​autobiography, Tears of 
the Praying Mantis (see Chapter 4), this encounter is described quite vividly:
I was blown over by Joseph Little and never could I predict how my 
acquaintance with him would irreversibly change the course of my life 
[…] I listened attentively to what [he] communicated regarding the true 
identity and culture of the people known as ‘Coloureds’ […] Suddenly 
all the years of inner turmoil, confusion, despondency and introspection 
fell into place like a picture-​puzzle gone crazy […] What I was searching 
for all those agonizing years was in fact right with me, it was me, and I 
found myself! It took one Joseph Little to pluck me from the depths of 
ignorance and to unlock the potential within myself if I were to live my 
life as me.
coetzee 2019b, 93–​94
Although his father had always expressed pride in his ‘Khoi distinctiveness’ 
and vehemently rejected any association with the term Coloured while grow­
ing up in Paarl, it was Little who ‘ignited the proverbial dynamite’ inside 
Coetzee and made him ‘no longer live a lie’ (ibid., 94–​95). Whereas he would 
have sued anyone who had called him ‘Hotnot’ previously, he would now thank 
them for reminding him of his history and what his ancestors had to endure: ‘I 
turn it now into a positivity’ (Basil Coetzee, 25/​04/​2018).7 Coetzee soon had the 
impression that Little ‘has a way of twisting facts’ and he was scorned and rid­
iculed for associating with him, but this was immaterial in light of the urgent 
need to ‘build something that did not exist’. He and others found inspiration 
for their mission during the cchdc’s weekly meetings in the Athlone com­
munity centre. Here they discussed books, shared and photocopied new liter­
ature they had come across, and talked Khoisan culture and history in general 
(Coetzee 2019b, 227). Coetzee (06/​05/​2018) described it as ‘an academic oper­
ation’ where they cross-​read and analysed several historical and contemporary 
authors: ‘we do not own our history so we created a whole bibliography on the 
Khoi’. This was not just a way to inform themselves, but also to spread a new 
type of historical consciousness among Coloureds:
	7	 It is worth noting that the South African Equality Court ruled in 2015 that hate speech 
(including the use of words like ‘Hotnot’) is a punishable offence (see Williams 2015). Whereas 
‘Hottentot’ is likely judged in the same manner, it should be noted that this is a historical 
term, which, while still offensive, is considered less offensive than the word Hotnot, which is 
specifically designed to demean and denigrate (see Chapter 2).

Chapter 3
The undoing of the deliberate destruction of our people’s identities were 
a very difficult challenge as the denialism and lack of knowledge existent 
in our people were so fervently ensconced that we had to devise specific 
stratagems to sway our people with our message […] We held informa­
tive meetings at the residences of people in various communities and 
at schools with fairly reasonable success […] We accepted invitations to 
address communities, schools and unexpectedly from church leaders 
from various denominations.
coetzee 2019b, 150
Little too remembers the passions that drove their collective research and the 
Eurocentric bias they had to contend with:
We wanted to find out about our history, going as deep as possible, going 
to the Diaz’ story, looking for the correct name of our people […] One of 
the major discoveries I made in the books was that there were a lot of 
untruths written about us and taught to us at school […] We never heard 
about Krotoa or Doman. At school they called our people strandlopers, 
wanderers without community spirit […] so we had to swing the history 
more in our favour.
joseph little, 17/​05/​20188
Texts were obtained from archives, libraries, and universities, but also from 
academics who were supportive of their endeavours. Coetzee (2019b, 133) notes 
that a ‘valuable and scholarly fount of expertise’ in this regard was Ron Martin. 
When Martin joined the cchdc in 1999, he was working as a heritage practi­
tioner for the National Monuments Council, where he collaborated with the 
aforementioned archaeologist Janette Deacon in her project to remove graf­
fiti from rock art sites in the Cederberg region. Martin, but also on occasion 
other cchdc members, accompanied Deacon and her team as they went to 
restore sites. These trips gave them direct exposure to Khoisan culture and 
became an excellent setting to meet like-​minded Khoisan revivalists and sup­
portive academics (Janette Deacon, 06/​08/​2019; see also Coetzee 2019b, 133, 
156). The cchdc went for fieldtrips of their own as well, particularly in the 
Northern Cape, where they effectively conducted participant observation 
among the Nama and the San to learn about their ways of life (Basil Coetzee, 
	8	 Although this project never came to fruition, Little professed in 1997 to be in the process of 
compiling a history textbook (‘Chief Little takes on a big job.’ Mail & Guardian (1997) https://​

13/​12/​2018). ccdhc members also scouted out relevant scientific conferences, 
such as the World Archaeological Congress, which was held in Cape Town in 
1999. Indigenous people from all over the world attended, which turned it 
into a unique networking opportunity for the cchdc, as well as for the gnc, 
who made use of the occasion to call for the repatriation of Sarah Baartman’s 
remains (Gordon 2000, 606; Coetzee 2019b, 149; see below).
By participating in conferences, improvising community-​oriented history 
seminars, conducting fieldwork, and drawing on academic materials –​ not least 
the Khoisan revisionist historiography I discussed in Chapter 2 –​ the cchdc 
shaped Khoisan revivalism in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As stated ear­
lier, these endeavours were coupled with calls for recognition from the state. 
Yet the type of recognition the cchdc desired was not entirely clear. Besten 
(2006, 294–​295) notes how the cchdc profiled itself on section 235 of the 
Constitution, which deals with the right to self-​determination for ‘any commu­
nity sharing a common cultural and language heritage’, and section 7, which 
makes provision for the recognition of traditional leadership. The cchdc 
was open to anyone who identified as Khoisan, regardless of lineage or creed 
(Joseph Little, 08/​05/​2018). The criteria for becoming a ‘chief’ as opposed to 
a mere member were not as clear cut, although they were in practice those 
most involved in the cchdc’s day-​to-​day affairs. Coetzee (06/​05/​2018) main­
tains that tribes were referenced to create an awareness of people’s origins, 
not to bring back ‘tribal consciousness’. Indeed, Little seems to have been the 
one most adamant about getting the cchdc’s revived structures officially rec­
ognized by the state. This was in large part a reaction to the 1997 Council of 
Traditional Leaders Act, which provided for the recognition of traditional lead­
ers from other ethnic groups (Ntsebeza 2005; Oomen 2005; Ainslie and Kepe 
2016, 20). The 1996 Communal Property Association Act and later the 2004 
Communal Land Rights Act, which was declared unconstitutional in 2010, also 
made provisions for (traditional) communities to claim and manage land col­
lectively, if according to locally shared customs (Walker 2008, 66). While the 
functions and privileges of traditional leaders remained contested and vague, 
their envisaged role was ceremonial and advisory (Williams 2009, 191–​192; 
Settler 2010, 56–​58). All the while, their permanent presence in South African 
politics was guaranteed and hence there was much for Khoisan revivalists like 
Little to campaign for.
The anc-​led government, and to a lesser extent the Khoisan themselves, 
directed the process of recognising Khoisan leadership in a different direction. 
Griqua representatives had scored a victory in 1997 with the establishment 
of the ngf and were not inclined to collaborate with other groups, particu­
larly the cchdc (Waldman 2007b, 55). For Mansell Upham, associating with

Chapter 3
Little ran the risk of ‘trivializing’ those ‘with genuine historic claims’.9 Khoisan 
revivalists were a recent phenomenon, and it took time for the gnc to warm 
up to the term ‘Khoisan’, which most San representatives and advocates con­
tinue to reject (Henry Bredekamp, 03/​07/​2018; see also Bredekamp 2001, 199; 
Besten 2006, 263). Then again, as Richard Lee and Robert Hitchcock (2001, 
272) observed, while Khoisan revivalists might have lacked the cultural legit­
imacy of the Griqua or the San, they made up for it with their ‘political and 
media clout’. Little leveraged his influence to mint alliances with the gnc’s 
numerically weaker rivals (Besten 2006, 282). While the ngf created an incen­
tive for the various Griqua factions to unite, tensions remained, particularly 
among the two competing branches of the gnc (Waldman 2007b, 31–​32, 53–​
54). These branches are often referred to as ‘gnc-​Knysna’ and ‘gnc-​Kranshoek’, 
based on where their main offices are located. When speaking of the ‘gnc’ up 
till now, I was referring to the more prominent gnc-​Kranshoek and its lead­
ing spokesperson, Cecil Le Fleur. For reasons I explained in Chapter 2, the 
split occurred in 1967. In the 1980s, gnc-​Knysna formed the ‘Griqua National 
Council’ together with the Griekwa Volks Organisasie of Archbishop Daniel 
Kanyiles, and it is this organization Little later endorsed as well (Brink 2003; 
Waldman 2007b, 46).
Little struck up a friendship with Kanyiles, who had campaigned for Griqua 
recognition for decades and was at the time a member of the National Council 
of Provinces for the National Party. Together they launched yet another orga­
nization in 1998, the National Council of Khoi Chiefs (nckc). As Little (08/​
05/​2018) explained to me in reference to the Waterboer lineage among Griqua 
leaders, ‘Kanyiles had been sworn in by Waterboer, the King’ so it was only 
right that he became the ‘Paramount Chief’ of the organization (see also Brink 
2003, 6). On the occasion of a government-​sponsored meeting on the ‘constitu­
tional accommodation of vulnerable indigenous communities in South Africa’ 
in Kimberley in 1998, the nckc officially inducted several ‘chiefs’ (Bredekamp 
and Olivier 2000, 40–​41). Most, if not all, of the twelve inductees were cchdc 
affiliates. Little had come across the !Nau –​ an ancient ritual practiced by cer­
tain Khoisan groups that I say much more about in Chapter 6 –​ while con­
ducting fieldwork in Namibia in 1996 (Joseph Little, 17/​05/​2018). He learned 
that the !Nau was part of a swearing-​in ceremony, whether for chiefs or rank

of Kimberley’s old city hall on 25 April 1998 (see also Besten 2006, 297). The 
inductees were asked to swear that they would further the cause of Khoisan 
revivalism ‘as a First National indigenous descendant of the Great Khoi Nation 
of Southern Africa, So help me !Tsui!Goab/​God’ in front of a Commissioner 
of Oaths and several government officials. Certificates were issued upon com­
pletion as well as necklaces of beads whose colours Little carefully selected to 
reference historical tribes, for example by mirroring the colour of the minerals 
that were found in the area at the time they were first documented (Joseph 
Little, 08/​05/​2018). As new members joined the nckc, it repeated !Nau cere­
monies near the Kango Caves in Oudtshoorn in 1999 and 2000 (Besten 2006, 
298; Coetzee 2019b, 158, 164; see Chapter 6).
Little’s prominence at the 1997 conference and the geographical reach of the 
ccdhc and nckc made the Department of Provincial and Local Government 
appreciate how Khoisan issues extended beyond the Griqua and the San. To 
avoid drowning in a plethora of competing organizations, they decided at 
the aforementioned meeting in Kimberley in 1998 that Khoisan grievances 
would best be dealt with through a National Khoisan Forum, a non-​statu­
tory body which was renamed the National Khoisan Council (nkc) the year 
after (De Wet 2010b, 17–​18). Significantly, it was Little and not an established 
Griqua leader who was elected as chair, a position he filled until 2011 (Cecil 
Le Fleur, 10/​07/​2019). The government hailed the inauguration of the nkc 
as ‘a truly historic occasion, [restoring] the pride and dignity of the Khoisan’ 
(Department of Constitutional Development 1999). Some Khoisan hoped the 
nkc’s mandate included land claims. Little had made his way to the United 
Nations in 1999 to plead for the recognition of aboriginal title (see below) in 
South Africa in a speech about the illegitimacy of the 1672 treaty between the 
voc and the Khoisan (Little 1999; see Chapter 2). What brought Khoisan land 
rights more firmly before the public eye was the much-​publicized restitution 
of about 68,000 hectares of land to the ≠Khomani San in the Northern Cape 
in 1999 (Ellis 2012, 14). As various academics have pointed out, the portrayal 
of the ≠Khomani San as pristine indigenes by organizations such as sasi 
surely contributed to it becoming the first land claim that was settled in the 
post-​apartheid era (Robins 2003a, 131; Ellis 2012, 121; Koot and Büscher 2019, 
358). At the official ceremony where the land was returned, the Minister of 
Agriculture and Land Affairs celebrated not just the land claim, but ‘the rebirth 
of the ≠Khomani San’ (Sylvain 2002, 1081). President Thabo Mbeki likewise 
applauded ‘an ancient people of Africa who regained not only their freedom 
but their identity’ (Besten 2006, 278). He even reasoned it proved his govern­
ment was adhering to UN guidelines regarding indigenous peoples (Chennels 
and du Toit 2004, 100). Legally speaking, the reason the land was returned had

nothing to do with the claimants being Khoisan but with the fact that their 
dispossession from the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park took place in 1931, 
after the constitutionally enshrined cut-​off date of 1913, and as a result of ‘past 
racially discriminatory laws or practices’, that is, the requirements of South 
Africa’s land restitution program.
As I show further on, Khoisan land claims were eventually dealt with 
by another body than the nkc, whose initial mandate was strictly about the 
constitutional recognition of Khoisan communities and traditional leaders 
(Bredekamp 2015, 12). The nkc was originally composed of 22 members, who 
were all elected during the aforementioned meeting where the plans for the 
National Khoisan Forum were laid out (Le Fleur and Jansen 2013, 3). Till this day 
there is little information available regarding the nkc’s activities or its member­
ship. They lack an established communication channel and it is unclear how 
frequently they convene or what is discussed during their meetings. The nkc 
receives little to no funding from the government, who only occasionally reim­
burses travel expenses; it never paid out salaries (enn 2013d, 12; Chantal Revell, 
25/​11/​2014; Henry Bredekamp, 10/​07/​2018). But most frustrating to nkc members 
is the government’s ambiguous position regarding recognition. While the rea­
son for dealing differently with the Khoisan than with other ethnic groups was 
never officially stated, some claim it is due to the Khoisan extinction discourse’s 
afterlife in the post-​apartheid era, that is, the notion that Khoisan culture did 
not survive the violence of colonialism and apartheid (ilo/​achpr 2009, 1). 
Besten (2006, 274) recounts a revealing episode in this regard from 1995. It con­
cerns a reply from Cecil Le Fleur to Roelf Meyer, then Minister of Constitutional 
Development. The latter doubted whether the Griqua met the criteria for the 
recognition of traditional leadership set out in the interim Constitution, par­
ticularly the need for an unabated practice of indigenous law or tradition. Le 
Fleur’s retort took Meyer to task for his apparent ignorance concerning the cen­
turies of violence and assimilation the Khoisan had experienced:
For years, first by the Brits and later by other governments, we have been 
deprived of our traditional customs and rights. Later we were forcefully 
classified as coloureds and deliberately stripped of our identity. Enter a 
house today and you might find Griqua parents, a coloured son, a Griqua 
daughter and another one classified as Cape Coloured or Other Coloured. 
It is only logical that we do not pass that test [of cultural purity].

The government’s reluctance to grant the Khoisan recognition also stemmed 
from their self-​identification as indigenous people and calls for indigenous 
rights. While Khoisan articulations of indigeneity cannot be reduced to prior 
occupancy and special rights, these two connotations of the term ‘indigenous’ 
render it highly controversial in South African society (see Conclusion). South 
Africa was promoting itself as a ‘Rainbow Nation’ at the time, where every­
one collectively made up the multicultural rainbow by cherishing their own 
‘colours’ or cultures but adhered to the same Constitution. The young nation 
also struggled with Zulu separatists in KwaZulu-​Natal and was perhaps fearful 
of a similar scenario unfolding among the Khoisan. As a result, ethnicity in 
general was viewed as potentially destabilizing. The Constitution, internation­
ally recognized for its progressive nature, had also just been passed in 1996; 
coincidentally in a ceremony where Mbeki (1996) controversially pronounced 
the Khoisan ‘perished’ as result of their resistance to colonial violence in his 
famous speech I am an African. He mentioned the Khoisan’s purported extinc­
tion again when he inaugurated the new South African Coat of Arms in 2000, 
although this went largely unnoticed, perhaps because the Coat of Arms was 
inspired by a famous rock art display and the motto was written in |Xam :!ke 
e: |xarra ||ke [diverse people unite] (Barnard 2004, 10). Mbeki also referred to 
the Khoisan as ‘the very first inhabitants of our land’ (ibid., 5–​6). As I show 
further on, Mbeki was not the only official to acknowledge the Khoisan’s indi­
geneity, but as stated before, the government’s stance has never been spelled 
out. Insights into government attitudes and opinions towards the Khoisan 
therefore need to be gleaned from a swathe of official documents that speak to 
the issue of Khoisan traditional leaders. These documents are either publicly 
available –​ if one knows where to look for them –​ or I have gotten access to 
them via my interlocutors.
One of the earliest documents in this regard are the so-​called Status Quo 
Reports (sqr), which were mandated by the Department of Constitutional 
Development in the late 1990s. As their name suggests, these aimed to get an 
overview of where Khoisan groups in South Africa stood in terms of historical 
background, current membership and political aspirations. Khoisan revival­
ists, including nkc members, often complained to me about the inaccessi­
bility of the sqr, and I too never managed to get a hold of them, with one 
exception (enn 2013d, 13; see below). However, Bredekamp shared a report

with me that summarized, evaluated, and elaborated on the sqr at the request 
of the Department of Provincial and Local Governance in 2000, after they 
had taken over the Khoisan portfolio (Henry Bredekamp, 10/​07/​2018). His 
collaborator was Nic Olivier, a law professor at the University of Pretoria who 
had previously done consultancy work for the Department. Bredekamp and 
Olivier (2000, 6) note that the sqr consist of five individual research papers, 
each looking into one of the five Khoisan groups the government identified 
and which also formed the basis for the nkc’s composition: the Griqua, San, 
Nama, Korana, and Cape Khoi. One source claims the respective authors are 
Anthony Le Fleur, Pippa Skotnes (the curator of Miscast, see Chapter 2), Willa 
Boezak (a cchdc member), ‘Mr. Beddy’, and George Brink (also affiliated to 
the chdc) (enn 2013b, 14). Gauging the ‘status and authenticity’ of each group 
was left to unnamed government officials. It is unclear how these authors were 
appointed, although some sources state the communities concerned chose 
them (drdlr 2013, 96). Whoever authored which parts of the sqr, it was evi­
dent to Bredekamp (10/​07/​2018) that the government was dissatisfied with 
their quality. I came across Brink’s report at the University of Stellenbosch, who 
later conceded to me it was not his finest work (George Brink, 09/​05/​2018). 
Despite using the ‘historical method’ to track down and evaluate Khoisan lead­
ers (Brink 2000, iv, 16), Brink merely listed them and their contact information 
alongside a description of the historical tribes they were reviving. Without 
providing evidence, he claims they all have valid bloodline claims and should 
receive funding and recognition (ibid., iv, 2, 57–​58). Bredekamp and Olivier 
(2000, 46, 96) instead called for ‘a much more reliable study of the bloodline 
claims of all current ‘chiefs’ who claim royal lineage’, together with an appraisal 
of how far membership extends beyond the leading figures in the cchdc: ‘It 
seems still too much a matter of many chiefs but not yet Indians to follow’.
The authors were overtly sceptical of any self-​proclaimed Khoisan traditional 
leader being a direct descendant of those that were recorded in the 17th and 
18th centuries. Due to a lack of ‘credible written and oral sources’, they argued 
there is ‘almost no proof yet that most of the current incumbents represent a 
legitimate bloodline to occupy the office of traditional Chief’ (Bredekamp and 
Olivier 2000, 95, 170–​171). Little’s lineage claims are flagged at various points in 
the report as ‘extremely problematic’ in light of his prominent position (ibid., 
15, 53). Khoisan revivalism had more to do with people reviving ‘a suppressed 
self-​identity’ than with traditional leadership, the authors concluded (ibid., 
170). The report also appraised whether the Khoisan qualified as ‘vulnerable 
indigenous people’ (see Bredekamp 2015, 12–​13). The qualifier ‘vulnerable’ set 
the precedent for what more or less became the South African government’s 
implicit take on Khoisan indigeneity, although it is at times couched in slightly

different terms (see below): the Khoisan face a specific predicament but not 
one that warrants special rights, as every African is indigenous to South Africa. 
The first to frame the Khoisan as ‘vulnerable indigenous people’ was the South 
African Human Rights Commission (sahrc) in its 1999 ‘Research Project on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples’ (sahrc 1999a). The research project’s stated 
objective was to ‘inform government’s process in addressing the rights of indig­
enous groups in South Africa, particularly those of the Khoi and San peoples, 
whose rights, for various historical reasons, are not adequately provided for in 
relation to other indigenous communities in South Africa’ (sahrc 1999b; my 
emphasis). I could not access the sahrc report as it was embargoed soon after 
completion, but Bredekamp and Olivier cite an interesting section of it dealing 
with indigeneity in South Africa:
The term first nation is often used to refer to those indigenous commu­
nities who had inhabited a specific territory before the arrival of colo­
nists […] Within the South African context, there is no evidence that the 
Khoisan communities had settled in parts of what later became the geo­
graphical area of 1910 South Africa before the settlement of other indige­
nous communities […] It has to be concluded that it cannot be said that 
the South African vulnerable (or marginalised) indigenous communities 
should be accorded first nation status (with the possible exception of the 
San).
sahrc 1999a cited in bredekamp and olivier 2000, 102
According to Bredekamp and Olivier (2000, 147–​148), the 1999 sahrc report 
suggested self-​identification and lineage as criteria to qualify as indigenous. 
However, as the authors note, these are too vague and do not elucidate the 
distinction between indigenous people and ‘vulnerable’ indigenous people. 
Bredekamp and Oliver point to the International Labour Office’s Indigenous 
and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169) (hereafter ‘ilo 169’) for inspi­
ration instead. Besides self-​identification, the ilo 169 upholds prior occu­
pancy and ‘social, cultural and economic’ distinction as requirements. The 
authors also disagreed with the sahrc’s purported suggestion to recognize 
Khoisan leadership through the same mechanisms as other ethnic groups, and 
instead proposed a ‘special form of recognition and protection by the state’, for 
instance by giving the nkc statutory recognition (ibid., 148). As I show below, 
it took more than a decade for the South African government to take a decision 
on this matter. When the 2001 annual report of the International Work Group 
for Indigenous Affairs (Crawhall 2001, 284), a leading indigenous rights orga­
nization, claimed the South African government had recognized the Khoisan

as indigenous people at the UN in 2000, this was only partially true as this 
‘recognition’ did not translate into any meaningful legislative accommodation 
in South Africa itself. As I show next, the government did keep looking into 
the issue and attempting to refine its position, not least because of the contin­
uous pressure from this pioneering cohort of Khoisan revivalists, whose pop­
ularity and clout peaked in the aftermath of the follow-​up edition of the 1997 
conference.
3.1.2	
Khoisan Politics in the Aftermath of the 2001 National Khoisan 
Consultative Conference: From Peak to Stagnation
If the 1997 conference stood out for the number of Khoisan delegates in 
attendance, the 2001 National Khoisan Consultative Conference held at the 
Burgersentrum in Oudtshoorn between 29 March and 1 April (hereafter ‘the 
2001 conference’) took things one step further and scheduled a majority of 
Khoisan presenters. It had been resolved in 1997 to have another edition in 
three years’ time, but plans for Springbok and Gaborone (Botswana) fell 
through, causing some delay (Crawhall 2002, 422).11 uwc once again acted as a 
sponsor, and the government covered the travel and accommodation expenses 
of Khoisan delegates (Besten 2006, 321). As Bredekamp (18/​12/​2018) explained 
to me, the 2001 conference differed from its predecessor ‘where Khoisan stud­
ies itself was at issue’ since Khoisan representatives took centre stage this time 
around: ‘I proposed a ‘consultative’ conference […] Let us no longer have aca­
demics invite Khoisan people as such, but have another dynamic and more 
emphasis on people speaking for themselves about themselves’. A number of 
intellectuals entered the Khoisan revivalist scene around this time, such as 
Priscilla De Wet, William Langeveldt, and Willa Boezak, who were all eager to 
present at or at least attend the conference. Most of them were also affiliated 
to the cchdc at one time or another. Among them was also Poem Mooney, 
head of the Attaqua, whose organizing abilities and prominence in the area 
motivated the decision to hold the conference in Oudtshoorn. Bredekamp and 
the organizing committee –​ which was virtually identical to the one of the 
1997 conference –​ held a series of meetings around the country to scout for 
potential delegates. For reasons that are not entirely clear, Little is mentioned 
in the list of delegates in Oudtshoorn but did not sit on the organizing com­
mittee. Nor did he deliver a presentation. cchdc affiliates nevertheless once 
again turned out in droves, although the most prominent among the 500–​600

Securing funding for the conference in Botswana was difficult, in part because its govern­
ment was not inclined to engage with the issue of indigenous people within its borders 
(Henry Bredekamp, 18/​12/​2018).

delegates at the 2001 conference were Griqua and Nama-​related organizations 
(Besten 2006, 320; enn 2013b, 14).
Bredekamp’s opening remarks set the tone for the gathering, which he 
saw as an extension of the ‘battle for identity’ he announced at the 1997 
edition: ‘[Khoisan revivalism] is a highly necessary process of self-​discov­
ery, through which you recuperate your humanity through your indigeneity 
and claim and celebrate your true identity’ (enn 2014e, 12).12 Besten (2006, 
323), who also attended the 2001 conference, recalls how the meeting was all 
about ‘Khoe-​San self-​affirmation and multi-​dimensional empowerment, that 
is […] in the economic, political, cultural and psychological realms’. cchdc 
members delivered most of the presentations. Willa Boezak (2001) high­
lighted the common ground between Khoisan spirituality and Christianity 
(see Chapter 4); George Brink (2001) sketched an overview of Khoisan cul­
tural practices; Basil Coetzee (2001) detailed how the Khoi lost their identity 
through the ‘internalization of Coloured identity’ and their forceful conver­
sion to Christianity; and William Langeveldt (2001) spoke about the need for 
land to restore Khoisan culture. Cecil Le Fleur (2001) pleaded for more aware­
ness around international developments in the field of indigenous rights. He 
moreover argued that the social ills plaguing Coloured communities are due 
to an ‘identity crisis’ (Garman 2001). Besten (2006, 323) recalls how emotional 
appeals to Khoisan indigeneity as the antidote to marginalization were met 
with resounding applause from the audience; indeed setting a trend for years 
to come (see Chapter 4). Remarkably, these sentiments were to a large extent 
echoed by then Deputy-​President Jacob Zuma. Bredekamp and the organiz­
ing committee had invited Mandela to the 1997 conference, but he instead put 
in a letter of endorsement (Bank 1998a, x). Then President Mbeki could not 
make it either at the 2001 conference but dispatched his deputy, Jacob Zuma 
(Henry Bredekamp, 18/​12/​2018). Zuma’s address stands out among speeches 
on Khoisan issues for its support for Khoisan revivalists and their political 
aspirations:
It is the first time that people of Khoisan descent […] the first indigenous 
people of our country […] have taken charge of [their] heritage and des­
tiny […] Not even 350 years of harsh colonial rule and apartheid policies 
have crushed the Khoisan spirit […] The history of the struggle against 
colonialism cannot be complete until we record the stories of heroes

such as Khoisan leader Autshumato […] As descendants of the San and 
Khoekhoe whose ancestors lived here for over 100.000 years and popu­
lated the rest of the world, you are a shining example of the liberating 
effects of democracy […] The strong cultural and social focus of this con­
ference will provide significant inspiration for the African renaissance 
movement […] The growing sense of pride amongst people of Khoisan 
descent about their roots in Southern Africa will bring increased benefits 
[…] There is value in Khoisan heritage beyond land claims and tourism. 
Acknowledging where you came from –​ as did the descendants of slaves 
in the United States forty years ago –​ is empowering because it gives you 
the choice to decide where to place yourself in the broader South African 
society.
zuma 2001; my emphasis
There is a lot to unpack here. Zuma acknowledges the ancient presence of the 
Khoisan, their resistance to colonialism as well as their neglect in historical 
consciousness. He also cheers on Khoisan revivalism, which he acknowledges 
is not just about land claims or looking for opportunities in tourism. It is in fact 
a ‘choice’ about which position one takes in South African society. At the same 
time, in describing the Khoisan as the first indigenous people, which Zuma has 
not done since, he remains deliberately ambiguous about indigenous rights or 
who the indigenous people of South Africa are (if any). Indeed, in line with the 
philosophy of Mbeki, Khoisan revivalism is both stimulated and captured as 
an expression of the African Renaissance, the overall celebration and promo­
tion of African culture (Johnson 2011, 29). One of the most interesting lines of 
the speech is the promise of ‘increased benefits’. He once again remains vague, 
although later on he mentions greater access to heritage sites (see below), land 
restitution, and indigenous language development.
Khoisan delegates for their part put forward a series of recommendations 
as the National Khoisan Consultative Conference (nkcc), a new structure 
that was created during the 2001 conference. As is unfortunately the case with 
many similar kinds of bodies, information about its mandate, membership, or 
current status is scarce. However it is clear that the nkcc’s ambition was to 
get an overview of the grievances of Khoisan communities around the country 
and to present these as a united front to the government along with possible 
solutions. Despite some overlap with the nkc, some of its members ultimately 
joined the nkcc as well, including Le Fleur, who became chairman (Besten 
2006, 328). Nineteen other members were elected among the 30-​odd Khoisan 
groups represented at the 2001 conference (Crawhall 2002, 421). Resolutions 
had been improvised at the 1997 conference as well, naming among other

things the need for greater transparency and reciprocity in research and the 
recognition of Khoisan land claims (Bank 1998a, 43–​44), but the 2001 con­
ference explicitly produced actionable resolutions and presented these to 
the government (Bredekamp 2015, 2). These are unfortunately left out of the 
published conference proceedings (Institute for Historical Research 2001), 
but ‘Annexure D’ lists a series of grievances that sprang forth from meetings 
with Khoisan representatives in Cape Town, East London, Port Nolloth, and 
Kimberley Bredekamp, and the organizing committee carried out in prepa­
ration for the conference. These include not only demands for land and the 
constitutional recognition of Khoisan traditional leadership but also greater 
protection for indigenous knowledge systems, as well as control over Khoisan 
representation in education and the media. In the years directly following the 
2001 conference, two other issues would get a fair degree of attention from the 
government as well: heritage and the return of human remains.
The former concerns the Khoisan Legacy Project, which was initiated by the 
Ministry of Arts, Science, Technology and Culture during a meeting in Pretoria 
in 1999. Heritage specialists were asked to pitch potential ‘legacy projects’ to 
highlight ‘historical turning points’ and celebrate multiculturalism but above 
all to boost patriotism by commemorating ‘great leaders’ in the resistance 
against oppression (Rassool 2000, 11). Bredekamp’s suggestion for a national 
route covering significant places in Khoisan history made the final selection 
of ten (Henry Bredekamp, 18/​12/​2018). The South African Heritage Resources 
Agency (sahra), which Bredekamp was a member of between 2000 and 2003 
and chaired between 2016 and 2019, was mandated to draft a proposal of what 
became known as the Khoisan Heritage Route (khr). Funding was made avail­
able to get input from Khoisan communities during a series of meetings that 
were facilitated by the ihr (Deacon 2001, 49; Crawhall 2002, 423). A list of 
proposed sites related to rock art, battles of the colonial era, sacred sites, and 
places of forced removal was quickly compiled (Deacon 2001, 50–​51). Work on 
the khr stalled however because it was apparently unclear who was respon­
sible for implementing the project (Henry Bredekamp, 18/​12/​2018). A compre­
hensive report on the khr replete with a site catalogue only materialized in 
2013 (Department of Arts and Culture 2013b, 1–​10). All the while, the R3.5 mil­
lion earmarked for the project remained on the books in 2016, and it was said 
to remain ‘at the planning stage’.13 The Department of Arts and Culture also

it too remained under construction (dta 2019, 9). As Bredekamp (18/​12/​2018) 
saw legacy projects around anc figures such as the Albert Luthuli Museum 
being prioritized, he concluded that the government never fully committed 
to the khr. Coetzee (12/​05/​2018), who was involved in the early stages of the 
planning, likewise lost faith in the khr, dismissing it as ‘artificial cpr’ on 
Khoisan heritage.14
Khoisan revivalists therefore also looked elsewhere for support. Various 
ccdhc members joined the Western Cape Cultural Commission (wccc), a 
body formed in 1999 to register and subsidize organizations that safeguard and 
develop the cultures of specific demographic groups in the province (wccc 
2003, 8, 10–​11). Being part of the wccc gave the cchdc access to small-​scale 
funding. In 2002, ‘the Gorachouqua House’ for example received R668 to set 
up a Khoisan hut outside the public library of Grassy Park to promote aware­
ness about Khoisan culture (ibid., 11). That same year ‘the Gouriqua House’ 
was sponsored with R15,000 to convene a conference in Great Brak River to 
celebrate Khoisan heritage. It is unclear who currently sits on the wccc or 
what activities they are sponsoring related to the Khoisan.15 Another relevant 
body was the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of 
Cultural, Linguistic and Religious Communities (crlc), established in 2003. In 
her ma thesis, Priscilla De Wet (2006, 36), a cchdc member, argues that the 
crlc was a compromise between the anc and Afrikaner interest groups, who 
sought to guarantee protection of their minority cultures in the post-​apartheid 
era. With a mandate to protect and promote cultures, it operates somewhat 
like the wccc, albeit on a national scale. While two Khoisan representatives, 
Willa Boezak and William Langeveldt, sat on the original board and took up 
a mandate of five years, it is not clear what the crlc has done in terms of 
Khoisan heritage beyond flagging it as an issue requiring urgent attention

The latest concerning the khr is that Cabinet ‘approved it’ on 3 June 2020. A ‘Steering 
Committee’ has been appointed on 22 June 2021 ‘to drive and implement the develop­
ment of the National Khoi and San Heritage Route’. Among its members are Cecil Le Fleur 
and Chantal Revell. ‘Committee appointed to implement development of Khoi and San

(ibid., 44).16 De Wet (ibid., 5–​8, 37) concluded that the crlc’s mandate centres 
on minority group rights and is therefore ultimately ill-​equipped to deal with 
Khoisan grievances and indigenous rights; even if the government seems to be 
steering Khoisan politics in this direction, as I show in a moment.17
Firstly, I turn briefly to a ground-​breaking episode in the history of the repa­
triation of human remains: the much-​publicized reburial of Sarah Baartman 
in 2002. Baartman, a Khoisan woman from the Eastern Cape, was paraded as 
an exotic specimen in Europe in the early 19th century (see Chapter 2). Her 
remains were dissected and stored in jars of formalin by the French anato­
mist Georges Cuvier and a cast made of her body was displayed in the Musée 
de l’Homme in Paris until the 1970s (Fauvelle-​Aymar 2006, 127). The earliest 
calls to repatriate Baartman’s remains were made by the gnc in 1994, more 
specifically by Mansell Upham, who used his connections and appearances 
in the media to exert pressure on the French government (Morris 1997, 106; 
Schweitzer 2015, 173). The latter eventually agreed to return her remains, partly 
due to the popularity of Diana Ferrus’ (2006, 1–​2) evocative A Poem for Sarah 
Baartman.18 The South African government set about preparing an appropriate 
ceremony and approached Bredekamp and Yvette Abrahams, who completed 
a PhD dissertation on Baartman at the University of Cape Town in 2000, to 
figure out the particulars and get as much input from Khoisan communities as 
possible (Henry Bredekamp, 11/​12/​2018). The ceremony took place in Hankey 
on 9 August in front of a massive audience (Besten 2006, 339). The event 
deliberately coincided with National Women’s Day as well as the International 
Day of Indigenous Peoples as declared by the United Nations. While Mbeki 
mentioned the need to restore the ‘dignity and identity’ of the Khoisan during 
his speech, he likened the plight of Baartman to that of African women in 
	16	
Consulting the website of the crlc and some of the documentation it has uploaded did 
not clarify this matter (‘CRL Rights Commission.’ https://​crlcom​miss​ion.org.za/​, accessed 
20 March 2021).
	17	
Willa Boezak (personal communication 20/​05/​2021) disputes that the crlc did ‘noth­
ing’ for the Khoisan. As commissioner for the Northern Cape, he organized Khoisan-​
centred sessions in Namaqualand together with Langeveldt. Standing out among these 
events were a series of ‘peacemaking talks’ held between Nama and San near Steinkopf, 
at a site were Nama children who had been murdered by San were buried. Boezak and 
Langeveldt’s talk provided historical context and included a spiritual ceremony. As a 
result, the Northern Cape government declared the area a heritage site.
	18	
Other remains have been repatriated since (see e.g. Rassool 2015), but this was not a prev­
alent topic among most of my interlocutors, at least not when it came to the repatriation 
of specific individuals. More often, more generalized claims were made referencing the 
historical trade in humans remains (see Chapter 2), as well as the fact that many institu­
tions in South Africa and abroad likely still held their ancestors.

general in line with his African Renaissance philosophy (Besten 2006, 340–​
341; Schweitzer 2015, 177). Conversely, Khoisan revivalists saw Baartman as 
Khoisan first and foremost: a ‘mother and figure of the First Nation of South 
Africa’, as a cchdc-​affiliate put it in her speech (Besten 2006, 337–​338). With 
the world watching, Baartman’s reburial provided a unique opportunity to 
promote Khoisan culture and political aspirations. Khoisan revivalists such as 
Basil Coetzee and Joseph Little were dressed in traditional clothing and fea­
tured prominently at the ceremony. They and other cchdc members made up 
the majority of those who carried the coffin to Baartman’s final resting place 
(Coetzee 2019b, 220). Some gnc representatives also carried the coffin, but 
they were in a minority, symbolizing the influence they had lost to the cchdc 
(Besten 2006, 339). Little had also presided over the cleansing ceremony at the 
Cape Town Civic Centre the day before, where they reportedly read from the 
Bible, prayed, and burned buchu and aloe (ibid.).
The international coverage of Baartman’s funeral likely contributed to the 
Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples’ decision to visit South 
Africa in 2005. For two weeks, Rodolfo Stavenhagen met with Khoisan repre­
sentatives from various provinces (Stavenhagen 2005, 2–​3, 7). He subsequently 
compiled a condemning report, calling for, among others things, scrapping the 
1913 cut-​off date, providing for the Khoisan in existing traditional leadership 
legislation and giving them the ability to refuse being classified as Coloured 
(ibid., 7–​8, 19). The report also advised including the Khoisan in the next cen­
sus, a suggestion that had already been put forward by Bredekamp and Olivier 
(2000, 147). In the aftermath of the Stavenhagen report, the South African gov­
ernment appointed William Langeveldt, who I say more about in Chapter 4, as a 
Khoisan representative to the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous 
Issues for a period of three years, although he believes his job was mostly win­
dow dressing (William Langeveldt, 12/​03/​2018). South Africa also signed the 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (undrip) 
in 2007.19 Calling for various types restitution and recognition for indigenous 
people, the undrip is a powerful document, one that could have important 
	19	
On the occasion, the South African delegation reportedly urged its neighbours to sign the 
declaration as well. This is somewhat ironic considering that Namibia and Botswana’s pol­
icies towards indigenous people are very similar to those of South Africa. Despite a size­
able presence of ngo s dealing with the issue in their countries, particularly Botswana, 
their governments seem to be much more reluctant to explore the matter on a national or 
international level. Ultimately however, they too stress that all African citizen are indige­
nous and that no group warrants special treatment. For more on Khoisan in Namibia and 
Botswana, see Robins 2008, 67, 68; Chebanne 2010.

consequences for the South African context as well. However, as a non-​bind­
ing document it needs to be translated into national legislation, and this has 
not happened yet. Stavenhagen’s report was also never tabled in Parliament 
or officially responded to, once again showing the characteristically ambigu­
ous stance of the South African government. A flirtation with internationally 
recognized instruments also took place in the context of a land claim in the 
Richtersveld region in the Northern Cape that was settled after a protracted 
legal battle in 2003. Some experts argue that the international doctrine of 
aboriginal title was key to the claimants’ victory (see e.g. Chan 2004). In short, 
aboriginal title, which is recognized in countries like Australia, recognizes 
indigenous communal ownership of an area if the community in question 
can prove historical links or continuous occupation (Chan 2004, 115, 118–​119; 
Gilbert 2007, 609). The debate usually revolves around whether or not these 
rights were extinguished because of later developments. The court might have 
drawn inspiration from aboriginal title in underlining the Khoisan’s continued 
occupation of the area, but this did not amount to an official endorsement of 
the doctrine or a subversion of the 1913 cut-​off date (cf. Powell and Bennett 
2005, 431; Lehmann 2006, 521; Cavanagh 2012, 453). As with the ≠Khomani San, 
what ultimately made the land claim successful was that the Nama commu­
nity in question was unjustly dispossessed after 1913.20
Aboriginal title also conflicted with the unofficial standpoint that there 
were no indigenous people in South Africa, or that all Africans were equally 
indigenous. After a cascade of bureaucratic changes in 2000, it became unclear 
which department was in charge of the Khoisan portfolio (Crawhall 2001, 286, 
287). The report by Bredekamp and Olivier was apparently updated in 2004, 
but no further information is available (drdlr 2013, 96). That same year 
Cabinet agreed on a memorandum –​ also not available to the public –​ that 
envisioned recognizing ‘vulnerable indigenous communities’ via separate leg­
islation as well as an ‘inter-​department working group on indigenous affairs’ to 
coordinate this (Crawhall 2005, 511; Stavenhagen 2005, 2, 8; De Wet 2006, 27).21 
This working group commenced its activities in 2005 and received input from

The same goes for smaller settlements that were reached with regards to the farm ‘Ratelgat’ 
and the farm located in Bethany that were both returned to the Griqua in 1998 and 1999, 
respectively, and the land that was returned to the so-​called Schmidsrift Bushmen in 2000 
(see Schweitzer 2015, 138).
	21	
According to Nigel Crawhall (2003, 412) a 2003 revision of the 1999 sahrc report rec­
ommends that the concept of ‘vulnerable indigenous peoples’ be applied only to the 
≠Khomani San and the Nama. I could not locate this source or find further information 
about it.

the nkc during a ‘consultative workshop’ in 2007 (Ntsewa 2013, 13–​14). Willa 
Boezak recalls passionately debating during this meeting with government 
officials who were not convinced that the Khoisan needed to be classified as 
indigenous people (enn 2013b, 14). Indeed, the Department of Provincial and 
Local Governance compiled a ‘Policy Document on Khoi and San Governance 
Issues’ in 2009, which apparently convinced Cabinet to make a policy U-​turn 
and not go down the path of separate legislation after all.22 Ten years down 
the line, the issue of Khoisan recognition was back where it started as the gov­
ernment pondered whether the 2003 Traditional Leadership and Governance 
Framework Act –​ which includes the line ‘South African indigenous people 
consist of a diversity of cultural communities’ –​ and the 1997 National House 
of Traditional Leaders Act could be merged into new comprehensive legisla­
tion on traditional leadership, where the Khoisan would become part of the 
National House of Traditional Leaders.23 This vision culminated in the first 
draft of the National Traditional Affairs Bill in 2011, which I come back to in 
the next section.24
I can only speculate as to why there was little progress with regards the 
Khoisan traditional leadership legislation for almost a decade. Academic sup­
port for Khoisan revivalism certainly waned as long-​time efforts by Bredekamp 
and others to reinvent the ihr as a Khoisan studies centre were unsuccessful 
(Henry Bredekamp, 11/​12/​2018; cf. Brink 2001, 57).25 As mentioned in Chapter 2, 
various critics felt that the ihr’s legacy, or a focus on the Khoisan, were out 
of step with the times. Ex-​rector Jakes Gerwel expressed this sentiment quite 
clearly when he reprimanded Willa Boezak, who lectured at uwc and had 
joined the cchdc (Besten 2006, 305). He felt Khoisan revivalism was tan­
tamount to promoting a ‘recidivist neo-​ethnicity’ that betrayed the type of

This Policy Document is also often referred to as the ‘Draft White Paper on Khoi-​San

One source also mentions an elusive research report ‘focusing on the history and present 
social context of Khoisan communities (the San, the Korana, the Griqua, the Nama and 
the Cape Cultural Heritage Development Organisation (cchdo)’ compiled in 2010 (dta

Although a conference on ‘Research for Khoe and San Development’ was held in Gaborone 
in 2003, it is unclear how this relates to the conferences Bredekamp was involved in (see 
Motshabi and Saugestad 2004).

‘trans-​ethnic nation-​building’ Boezak’s brother Allan had fought for with the 
udf. With the blessing of Bredekamp, who retired as director of the ihr and 
became ceo of Iziko Museums in 2002, the nkcc approached the University 
of the Free State in Bloemfontein for support in 2004 (Henry Bredekamp, 
18/​12/​2018). Members of the Anthropology Department liked the idea and 
founded the Unit for Khoe and San Studies in 2007 to ‘provide an anchor for 
the indigenous movement in South Africa as well as to upgrade the academic 
and research skills of Khoe and San people’ (De Wet and Crawhall 2008, 521). 
While some Khoisan-​related conferences and research projects took place at 
ufs (cf. Crawhall 2005, 511; Erasmus 2012; Øvernes 2019, 205) and its website 
still mentioned the Unit at the time of writing, it became dysfunctional soon 
after opening its doors.26 According to Priscilla De Wet, who worked at the Unit 
for some time, it failed to involve the Khoisan as active agents in its research 
(De Wet 2011, 109). Piet Erasmus (Erasmus 2005,77, 89; 2010, 71), who headed 
the Unit, however argues that infighting among Khoisan representatives vying 
for influence was detrimental to its functioning.
Regardless of what ultimately caused the Unit’s downfall, infighting was 
clearly disrupting Khoisan revivalism. Combined with a lack of funding, inter­
nal discord reportedly caused the nkcc to disband in 2007 (De Wet 2006, 32; 
De Wet and Crawhall 2008, 519). Part of the disagreements arose over who was 
qualified to represent whom. In the nckc (not to be confused with the nkcc, 
see above), this too had become a burning issue when Kanyiles passed away in 
2003. Little (08/​05/​2018) maintains that Kanyiles appointed him as his succes­
sor and that he was sworn in during a !Nau where ‘two members of the National 
Party’ were also present. His leadership was fiercely contested, however, caus­
ing the nckc to collapse as well. Little blames his detractors for breaking the 
momentum of Khoisan politics and sees them as illegitimate representatives 
jockeying for positions that might yield financial benefits if and when they 
become officially recognized. Little’s assessment of the rise of self-​appointed 
Khoisan chiefs and the scourge of opportunism is shared by various others, 
such as Basil Coetzee (25/​04/​2018) or Bredekamp (10/​07/​2018), who both 
blame Zuma for promising to remunerate Khoisan traditional leaders in 2001, 
although the official speech transcript does not mention this. Others blame 
Little himself for appointing the first revived Khoisan ‘chiefs’. For reasons that 
are not entirely clear, while the cchdc –​ which by this time increasingly called 
itself the Khoi Cultural Heritage Development Council (kchdc) (Besten 2006,

He currently goes at it mostly alone and still organizes occasional !Nau cere­
monies among a much smaller number of followers (see Chapter 6). By his 
own account he is ‘virtually broke’ and does not have the means to organize 
conferences and create publicity like he did before. He had hoped to get a book 
published by this time to get some income, but he ‘never got that far’ (Joseph 
Little, 17/​05/​2018).
It is striking that, despite Little’s vital role in politicizing Khoisan identity 
and getting the South African government to take the matter seriously in the 
first decade of Khoisan revivalism, many Khoisan revivalists today have never 
heard of him. And yet, Little and others laid the groundwork for an even more 
vibrant and numerous Khoisan revivalism in the 2010s. Indeed, as I show next, 
the vacuum left by Bredekamp and Little was to a large extent filled by a new 
cohort of Khoisan revivalists who viewed and mobilised Khoisan identity and 
culture in a manner that differed significantly.

A New Cohort of Khoisan Revivalists
‘//​Hui!Gaeb. Where the clouds gather’ read the large green billboard that was 
unveiled outside the Castle of Good Hope on 28 June 2012. The ceremonial 
erection of the sign on this symbolic location meant to restore Cape Town’s ‘old 
name’ and assert a Khoisan presence in the city (Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras, 03/​
01/​2015).27 It was also a way to honour the well-​known ≠Khomani San leader 
Dawid Kruiper, who passed away earlier that month. The event was instigated 
by the Institute for the Restoration of the Aborigines of South Africa (irasa), 
created in 2009 by Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras, Francisco MacKenzie (also known 
as ‘Chief Autshumao’ or ‘Mackie’), and Nico Nel. That day in front of the mas­
sive billboard –​ which was not approved by the Castle or the City of Cape Town 
and was removed weeks later –​ irasa members held up placards that read 
‘Alienation and extermination of the Khoisan’, ‘Cultural genocide of the Khoisan’ 
and ‘Khoisan forever, “Coloured” never!!’ (see Chapter 4).28 Kleinhans-​Cedras

I was not able to trace the origins of the name //​Hui !Gaeb. However, Francisco MacKenzie 
claims people in Namaqualand still use it to refer to Cape Town (Mackie, 04/​07/​2018).

did not mince words when she told reporters that the Khoisan did not need the 
approval of ‘colonialists’ because their rights were entrenched in the ilo 169. 
Mackie in turn told those present that, to honour Kruiper’s legacy, the Khoisan 
should unite to form a strong front against the government: ‘the moment we 
become conscious, we become one’. The //​Hui!Gaeb billboard was sponsored 
by fast-​food chain Nandos, who were contacted by Kleinhans-​Cedras after 
they had implicitly endorsed Khoisan indigeneity in a controversial ad paro­
dying xenophobia (Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras, 03/​01/​2015). In the commercial, 
people with various ethnic groups and nationalities are dubbed ‘foreigners’ 
and vanish into puffs of smoke. When the camera finally turns to a Khoisan 
man dressed in animal skins and equipped with bow and arrow, he says ‘I’m 
not going anywhere. You *$&!@#* [blocked swearword] found us here’ before 
running off into the landscape. The ad debunked anti-​foreigner sentiments by 
showing how everyone but the Khoisan are technically ‘foreign’ to South Africa 
(cf. Mboti 2013, 456).
While the donation of Nandos made the //​Hui !Gaeb-​billboard possible, 
irasa organized similarly controversial activities that same year without 
outsider funding. In April, Mackie and Kleinhans-​Cedras climbed the statue 
of Jan van Riebeeck in Central Cape Town and covered it with black gar­
bage bags to mark ‘360 years of colonialism’. The media were told that the 
statue belonged to the apartheid museum or ought to be shipped off to the 
Netherlands.29 Kleinhans-​Cedras and Mackie called for more visible markers 
of Khoisan presence in the city, for instance by erecting statues of ‘Khoisan 
heroes’ (see Chapter 4). This type of heritage, Kleinhans-​Cedras argued, had 
to be reclaimed in the face of ongoing colonial oppression (en 2012b, 13). The 
perceived lack of respect for the Khoisan also motivated irasa to inaugu­
rate a small kraal and sign honouring ‘Tsui Goab’, the Khoisan god of rain and 
thunder, in Rondebosch Common, a public park in the southern suburbs of 
Cape Town, ‘where the first European farmers settled’ (Jethro 2017, 358). irasa 
wanted to transform the park into a place where Khoisan descendants could 
‘rediscover their self-​determination’. In 2013, irasa members occupied a build­
ing in District Six, one of South Africa’s most complex restitution cases involv­
ing a large number of displaced people from a historically multicultural area 
that since became prime real-​estate (Cronje 2013; see also Mceachern 1998). 
Kleinhans-​Cedras always placed an emphasis on land rights as her family had 
been forcibly removed three times under apartheid (Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras,

Chapter 3
03/​01/​2015). Mackie claimed it was their ‘fundamental right’ to occupy the land 
in District Six as it belonged to the ‘Cochoqua nation’, whose historical territory, 
he claims, stretched from Table Bay along the West Coast to St. Helena Bay. The 
‘Cochoqua flag’ was flown outside one of the windows of the building and a 
matjieshuis was improvised outside. The latter, Kleinhans-​Cedras argued, was 
to pay ‘homage to their ancestral roots’ and to ‘link us to the land before the 
development took place’ (Mposo and Dano 2013).
I will mention several other irasa-​led activities later on but it should 
already be evident at this point that they embodied a new approach to 
Khoisan politics, both in style and content. Preceding generations primarily 
expressed their grievances through institutionalized bodies and organizations 
that liaised with the government. This new cohort was more direct-​action ori­
ented and oppositional towards the state. While not without their critics, their 
influence proved to be enduring. To understand where this militant style of 
Khoisan revivalism comes from, it is worthwhile examining the backgrounds 
of the founding members of irasa.30 However, I want to remind the reader at 
this point that a lot of the information regarding (members of) organizations 
like irasa that are mentioned in this chapter is contested, hard to fact-​check, 
and mainly based on interview data. This is largely unavoidable due to the 
chaotic and quickly shifting nature of Khoisan revivalist politics –​ which is in 
itself a revealing finding –​ but it should nevertheless at all times be taken into 
account.
The relevance of this caveat becomes clear in light of Mackie’s account of 
his ‘awakening’ in 1969, when he spoke out against his colleagues at the South 
African Police Department in Caledon who referred to him as ‘amalawu’, an 
isiXhosa word meaning a person without a soul (Mackie, 02/​07/​2018; see also 
Adhikari 2006, 154). At first he struggled to formulate a response, but when 
he researched his family history –​ he is originally from the Hardeveld region 
of Namaqualand but moved to Cape Town at a young age –​ he ‘rediscovered 
himself’ and managed to ‘put in place the jigsaw puzzles’. Ever since, he iden­
tifies as a ‘radical, revolutionary conscious aboriginal Khoisan’. Being aware 
of his roots early on, Mackie sees himself as the progenitor of Khoisan reviv­
alism and the architect of the original ‘National Khoi-​San Council’. The idea 
for such a council, he claims, was the outcome of several meetings he held in 
Belhar in the 1980s with sympathizers such as Mervyn Ross, who founded the 
right-​wing social movement Kleurling Weerstandsbeweging vir die Vooruitgang

It seems irasa was mostly carried by Kleinhans-​Cedras and MacKenzie. Nel, who I did 
not manage to contact, seems to have receded to the background relatively soon after the 
organization’s founding (see below).

van Bruinmense (kwb) in 1995 (see Ruiters 2009, 116, 121), and a Peter James 
Holmes, both of whom he takes credit for ‘conscientizing’ (Mackie, 04/​07/​
2018). Mackie (05/​07/​2018) says there is ample documentation to back this 
up, but that Joseph Little and others jumped ship and stole his files to create 
the cchdc, which he dismisses as a rip-​off.31 Interestingly, Mackie’s timeline 
then shifts to uwc, where he graduated in theology in 1979 and took up a posi­
tion as faculty librarian for nearly thirty years. Mackie (02/​07/​2018) says he 
was vocal about his Khoisan roots on campus and constantly had to go against 
the grain as a result. He even claims to have ‘conscientized’ Bredekamp, who 
for his part only remembers Mackie speaking about Khoisan issues long after 
the 1997 conference (Henry Bredekamp, 03/​07/​2018). What is certain is that 
Mackie met Kleinhans-​Cedras at uwc as she worked as a shelf-​attendant at 
the same library for a while to finance her studies (Mackie, 04/​07/​2018). Their 
conversations at the library had a profound impact on her, as she explains in 
an article in Eland Nuus in 2009:
During 1982 my consciousness as an aboriginal KhoiSan was reaffirmed 
when I was pleasantly enthralled by the deep aboriginal spirit of [Mackie]. 
It was this initial meeting that fostered the connection of our ancestral 
calling, which has spanned three decades of active aboriginal KhoiSan 
consciousness in South Africa […] Then, in 1982 and a long time after­
wards, the word KhoiSan was a historical reality only in the textbooks of 
academia and historians.
en 2009c, 9
As noted previously, their ‘active aboriginal KhoiSan consciousness’ ultimately 
gave rise to irasa. During a 2015 interview, Kleinhans-​Cedras (03/​01/​2015) said 
the organization had 620 members and counting. Both Mackie and Tania are 
skilled at attracting and galvanizing followers with fiery speeches on the rela­
tion between Khoisan identity, indigenous rights, and contemporary socioeco­
nomic challenges, on which I elaborate at length in Chapter 4. They reasoned 
for instance that people needed to shed Coloured identity and embark on ‘an 
incomprehensible journey of the inner self on a deep spiritual level’ to rec­
ognize ‘the denial, alienation and extermination of the KhoiSan nation’ and 
become involved in the ‘fight for survival’ (en 2009c, 9). irasa broadcasts its

Because I came across this information during the final stages of my fieldwork in South 
Africa, I did not have enough time to cross-​check Mackie’s allegations or to contact some 
of the other people who he claimed were involved in the meetings in the 1980s. Most of 
them are seemingly no longer involved in Khoisan revivalism.

views via self-​funded road trips and educative workshops, but also through the 
abovementioned self-​described ‘radical’ actions (Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras, 03/​
01/​2015). This strategy was indeed consciously pursued by irasa since 2009 in 
order to draw more attention to the plight of the Khoisan: ‘The aggressiveness 
with which we are asserting our consciousness is so fast moving it is scaring 
the government’ (Mackie, 08/​01/​2015). Amplified by social media –​ WhatsApp 
and Facebook in particular –​ the type of Khoisan revivalism irasa promoted 
indeed spread rapidly (cf. De Wet 2012, 508). Yet, Mackie and Kleinhans-​Cedras 
were not its only exponents. Neither was social media the sole medium through 
which it proliferated.
In fact, one could make the case that Zenzile Khoisan, who is not a member 
of irasa, and Eerste Nasie Nuus (enn), the newspaper he co-​founded with 
Debbie Hendricks in 2013 (see Chapter 1), shaped the contemporary discourse 
on Khoisan indigeneity most of all. Zenzile boasts a distinguished career as a 
journalist, radio host, and pundit. He has worked for various outlets, including 
Bush Radio, Cape Argus, and Daily Maverick. Zenzile also acted as an investi­
gator for the trc and wrote about this work in his memoir Jakaranda Time 
(Khoisan 2001). He became involved with Khoisan issues after he joined the 
anc’s military wing, uMkhonto we Sizwe, at the age of 17 and was forced to 
flee South Africa (Zenzile Khoisan, 02/​05/​2018). In striking similarity to what 
happened to Mackie in 1969, one of Zenzile’s ‘comrades’ told him while in 
exile in Lesotho in July 1983 that, being Coloured, he had no culture or his­
tory to speak of. Triggered by this derogatory comment, Zenzile replied to 
his comrade by saying that, as a Zulu, he was in fact a member of a ‘young 
nation’; ‘the Khoisan fought the colonialists long before Shaka Zulu was born’. 
Emotionally-​charged exchanges such as these were a regular occurrence for 
Zenzile, who became convinced that Coloureds would never be regarded as 
equal to Blacks in the anti-​apartheid struggle, despite promises of anc lead­
ership to this effect. In the wake of these incidents, he committed himself to 
the Khoisan cause and unofficially changed his name from Charles Jackson 
to ‘Zenzile’ Khoisan, a isiZulu word he translated as ‘taking responsibility’. He 
eventually made his way to New York on a refugee passport, where he found 
inspiration among African-​American and indigenous activists before return­
ing to South Africa ‘with a Khoisan consciousness’ after the end of apart­
heid (Zenzile Khoisan, 17/​05/​2018). He also attended the 2001 conference. As 
Zenzile became involved in Khoisan revivalism, he railed against what he saw 
as the faulty premises of an anc-​driven cultural nationalism centred on Blacks 
at the expense of Coloureds and other minorities: ‘It is not because one is put 
in the pigsty and the other in the chicken pen that we were not all treated like 
animals during apartheid’ (Zenzile Khoisan, 17/​05/​2018). Like many others,

Zenzile (24/​05/​2018) feels affirmative action policies disproportionally benefit 
Blacks (see Chapter 5). Zenzile does not desire a special position for Coloureds 
reminiscent of apartheid but strives to be a ‘catalyst for broader social justice’ 
by addressing the country’s continued violation of the Khoisan. Drawing on 
revolutionary thinkers and indigenous intellectuals far and wide, he believes 
Khoisan revivalism is ‘the biggest antidote to capitalism’.
To jolt the ‘pacified proletariat’ into action, one needs to ‘sift through bro­
ken pieces of history to frame a sense of identity’ (Zenzile Khoisan, 02/​05/​
2018). While recognizing Little’s pivotal contributions, Zenzile wanted to push 
Khoisan revivalism ‘into overdrive’ and made a deliberate choice in 2001 to 
‘align struggle history to the earlier history’ (Zenzile Khoisan, 17/​05/​2018;24/​
05/​2018). As I detail in Chapter 4, Zenzile is unparalleled in the manner in 
which he frames Coloured people’s grievances in a Khoisan perspective. He 
does so in a revolutionary register that bears witness to his many years in exile 
and familiarity with indigenous struggles worldwide. He succeeded cchdc-​
affiliate Sharon Leng as head of the Gorinhaiqua in 2010. While Zenzile, or 
Chief !Garu as he is since also referred to, frequently attends public events, 
he shares most of his thoughts and those of likeminded Khoisan revivalists 
through Eerste Nasie Nuus (enn). enn was in many ways the successor of 
Eland Nuus, a biweekly newspaper that ran between 2009 and 2013. It was the 
brainchild of Desmond Sampson, a Cape Town-​based entrepreneur who car­
ried the newspaper until it turned a profit (Basil Coetzee, 06/​05/​2018; see also 
De Wet 2010a, 567). The idea for Eland Nuus had come to him as he travelled 
across South Africa in 2003 to explore his Khoisan roots (Desmond Sampson, 
22/​06/​2018). While Eland Nuus did not focus on Khoisan issues to the same 
extent as enn, it did regularly feature Khoisan revivalists such as Little, whose 
contributions on Khoisan history appeared in several issues (see e.g. en 2009d, 
15), or Yvette Abrahams, who wrote about the Khoisan and their relationship 
with food and plants (see e.g. en 2012a, 14). Sampson’s ambition was to spread 
awareness about Khoisan culture and to get Khoisan to share their thoughts 
through the newspaper. For this reason it appeared in Afrikaans and was sold 
at a cheap price across the Western Cape, Northern Cape, and Gauteng prov­
inces, in part with the help of volunteers such as Basil Coetzee (Basil Coetzee, 
25/​04/​2018). Eland Nuus eventually became a financial burden and was discon­
tinued (Desmond Sampson, 22/​06/​2018).
Until he left after a spat with the owner, Zenzile was sub-​editor at Eland 
Nuus and travelled throughout South Africa to report on Khoisan communi­
ties (Zenzile Khoisan, 17/​05/​2018; en 2012d, 2). He continued working with 
this network in enn, but the focus was more firmly on Khoisan indigeneity 
and political activism. The title of the newspaper embodied this and also

reflected the increasingly common import of international concepts such as 
‘First Nations’, ‘Aborigines’, or ‘First People’. enn aspires to be the ‘mid-​wife’ of 
the Khoisan revival by reporting on news related not only to land claims and 
recognition but also culture, history, ‘heroes’, and indigenous knowledge (enn 
2013a, 8). It informs its readers about upcoming events and relevant legislative 
or political developments, nationally and abroad. enn for example published 
the undrip (enn 2013c, 8–​9), had a themed issue on human rights (enn 
2017a), and reported on the plight of the Zapatistas in Mexico (enn 2013d, 1). 
The newspaper also seeks to amplify ‘submerged voices’ and ‘unite the nation’ 
(enn 2013a, 8). As noted in Chapter 1, the pages of enn feature opposing 
points of view, and I regularly found copies of the newspaper at events and 
interlocutors’ homes. If funding is available, up to 5000 enn printed copies 
are distributed across South Africa, but predominantly in Cape Town (Zenzile 
Khoisan, 07/​05/​2018).
Various others pushed Khoisan revivalism forward in the 2010s. One of these 
is Hennie van Wyk, head of the Gorachouqua since 2010 (Bam 2014, 124). Van 
Wyk, a former udf activist and an anc supporter, has an outspoken style and 
stands out with his porcupine quills headgear. He commonly appears in public 
alongside other members of his house, and is generally respected in Khoisan 
circles. However, I never managed to agree with the Gorachouqua House on 
the terms for an interview. While I am therefore to some extent ill-​equipped to 
make this assessment, the Gorachouqua House does not seem to have had the 
same impact on the development of Khoisan revivalism as a whole as irasa or 
Zenzile Khoisan. Another organization that needs to be mentioned is Khoisan 
Kingdom (ksk). Set up in 2010, the ksk was omnipresent during my fieldwork 
in 2014, as well as in the pages of enn around that time, but they were virtually 
absent when I returned in 2017. While the ksk describes itself in 2014 as a non-​
monarchical ‘cultural organization’ with ‘10,000 members’ that seeks to rally all 
Khoisan organizations under its banner, it is headed by the elusive ‘King Cardi’ 
(enn 2014c, 3–​4; see Chapter 5). It carried out various projects in and around 
Cape Town and the Northern Cape in 2013 and 2014 to combat ‘the deprived 
state’ of Khoisan descendants, mostly involving distributing water and food to 
those in need (enn 2014a, 3; 2014c, 5–​6; 2014e, 13; 2014f, 12; 2014j, 15; 2014k, 4; 
2016a, 4). Leveraging its prominence in Khoisan revivalist circles in the run up 
to the elections of 2014, the ksk secured meetings with the Deputy Minister 
of the Department of Rural Development and Land Affairs (enn 2014g, 5), the 
Western Cape Minister for Community Safety (enn 2014j, 4), as well as Julius 
Malema, the leader of the political party Economic Freedom Fighters (see 
Conclusion).

However, as I mentioned, the ksk became largely inactive soon after. This 
‘sudden’ disappearance was (and is) however not unusual for Khoisan organiza­
tions. As I explained in Chapter 1, the mushrooming of short-​lived organizations 
made it impossible to compile an overview of Khoisan revivalist entities in Cape 
Town. As I show below but particularly in Chapter 5, the unabated infighting 
between Khoisan representatives partly accounts for this. To contextualize why 
so many organizations came into being during this time and why they often 
compete vigorously with one another, I turn to legislative developments in the 
domain of land and traditional leadership.
3.2.2	
Land Reform, the Traditional and Khoi-​San Leadership Act, and the 
Advent of a Broad-​Based Identity Movement
In his 2012 State of the Nation Address, President Jacob Zuma told South 
African citizens that ‘[i]‌t is important to remember that the Khoi-​San people 
were the most brutalised by colonialists who tried to make them extinct, and 
undermined their language and identity. As a free and democratic South Africa 
today, we cannot ignore to correct the past’ (Zuma 2012). Zuma added that he 
had met with the ‘Khoi-​San community’ in Cape Town the year before and that 
they agreed to work together.32 In his State of the Nation Address the follow­
ing year, he announced that the 1994 Restitution of Land Rights Act would be 
amended to reopen the land claims process that previously ran between 1995 
and 1998. The restitution of land was part of the anc’s three-​tier land reform 
program alongside land tenure reform (i.e. securing rights for those who con­
tinued to work under unclear statutes) and land redistribution (i.e. the state 
buying up land for landless citizens). Zuma felt not only that too many had 
missed the opportunity to file their claims but also that ‘exceptions to the 
June 1913 cut-​off date’ needed to be codified, among other things ‘to accom­
modate claims by the descendants of the Khoi and San’. The 1997 White Paper 
On South African Land Policy issued by the Department of Land Affairs (1997, 
77–​78) argued that land claims before the cut-​off date would be impossible to 
verify and give rise to ‘overlapping and competing claims [which] awaken and/​
or prolong destructive ethnic and racial politics’. It is not entirely clear why the 
government decided to revisit its position in 2013. irasa however takes credit 
for this and points to a presentation it delivered in Parliament in 2010 highlight­
ing their exclusion from the restitution process and Khoisan marginalization 
	32	
I have not been able to figure out who Zuma was referring to here.

Chapter 3
more generally.33 Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras (05/​01/​2015) also mentioned several 
subsequent ‘informal meetings’ with the Department of Rural Development 
and Land Reform (drdlr) that were instrumental in changing their minds. 
Though the underlying motivations remain somewhat obscure, the drdlr 
organized two ‘National Khoi-​San Dialogues’ to explore Khoisan land issues 
in greater detail in 2013 and 2014. Both took place in Kimberley and are hence 
commonly referred to as Kimberley One and Kimberley Two.
This brings me to Chantal Revell, who featured prominently at both meet­
ings. In the next chapter, I delve deeper into her first encounters with Khoisan 
revivalism. Important to note here is that she was elected to the nkc as 
Western Cape representative in 2012 (Chantal Revell, 07/​10/​2014).34 The well-​
attended election in Rawsonville sought to make the nkc more inclusive of 
the various groups that had come to the fore since it was created in the late 
1990s (Bredekamp 2015, 16). This issue had already been flagged in 2005, but 
the nkc leadership was under the impression they were close to fulfilling their 
mandate and therefore feared elections would cause unnecessary delays (enn 
2013d, 12; see below). As noted previously, even though a lack of government 
support is partially to blame, the nkc communicated poorly with its constit­
uents, not least about who was on the council and how they had gotten there. 
Annual updates from the Indigenous World for instance mention ‘elections’ 
taking place in 2007 and 2008 without any additional information about why 
these were held or who participated in them (De Wet and Crawhall 2008, 518; 
De Wet 2009, 576–​577). Mounting criticism of the nkc, which I come back to 
below, made additional elections unavoidable however. The government con­
curred after consulting with complainants in March and April 2012, and the 
nkc –​ chaired by Cecil Le Fleur since Little’s departure in 2011 –​ subsequently 
expanded from 21 to 30 representatives (Jansen 2013, 440).
The reconfigured nkc was asked by the drdlr alongside other Khoisan rep­
resentatives to select roughly 100 delegates per province for ‘Kimberley One’, 
from which in turn a board of representatives would be established composed 
of 45 members, that is, five per province (Chantal Revell, 25/​11/​2014; Tania 
Kleinhans-​Cedras, 05/​01/​2015). The Western Cape elected Ron Martin, Wendy 
Williams, Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras, Abre Hector, and John Cornelius Witbooi 
during a meeting in March 2013. Gugile Nkwinti, the Minister of the drdlr

An additional Western Cape representative was also elected, Hillary Solomons, but she 
did not become involved in the nkc to the same extent as Chantal Revell (see Chapter 4).

inaugurated this ‘Reference Group’ of 45 at the gathering, which took place on 
15–​16 April 2013 and was ultimately attended by more than 500 delegates (enn 
2013a, 6; Gabie 2014, 64). A ‘Working Group’ of 12 was also appointed to com­
municate with Nkwinti and a policy-​subcommittee of five to suggest policy 
recommendations regarding exceptions to the 1913 cut-​off date and the recog­
nition of ‘historical landmarks’ and ‘heritage sites’ (enn 2014a, 2; 2014b, 2).35 
‘Historical researchers and academics’ were also envisioned to be part of the 
team, but this apparently fell through. There was a recurring call for Khoisan 
researchers to be involved at all stages of the process. Virtually all presenters 
also related the topic of land to issues such as organized crime, ‘psychologi­
cal trauma’, alcohol abuse, and housing (see Chapter 4). Concrete suggestions 
included recognizing Khoisan heritage sites, renaming ‘streets and hospitals’ 
after the Khoisan, valorising rock art as ‘title deeds’, and overall assistance from 
researchers to fact-​check competing claims.
Tommy Ntsewa, ‘special advisor’ to the Department of Traditional Affairs, 
also gave a presentation (Ntsewa 2013). He reasoned that all Africans were 
indigenous to South Africa because centuries of ‘assimilation’ and ‘absorp­
tion’ before the ‘more rude interruption’ of Europeans rendered differences 
between groups meaningless. Everyone ultimately had San ancestry, so they 
too did not need a special designation. ‘Excluding’ Africans as non-​indigenous 
would be unconstitutional and unethical. While he made clear that their lead­
ership still had to be recognized, his refusal to acknowledge the Khoisan as 
indigenous people enraged the audience to the degree that he was called back 
from the airport to apologize (Zenzile Khoisan, 12/​06/​2018). Some felt Ntsewa 
had given away the position of the government and had no business speaking 
about the Khoisan: ‘It seems that everyone, except the [Khoisan], can speak on, 
speculate and make wild assertions about our origins and our essential search 
for identity, cultural definition, and recognition’ (enn 2013e, 3). The Khoisan 
could ‘sort out their own history’ and did not need a ‘quack contaminating 
it’. There were other reasons why the Khoisan did not share the government’s

celebration of Kimberley One as an ‘epic and historical moment’.36 Many felt 
the cut-​off date was never up for debate; the government wanted to negoti­
ate with ‘Coloureds’, not with indigenous people (enn 2013a, 1, 6). Discussions 
about land were also deemed premature as the issue of Khoisan traditional 
leadership and indigenous status was still up in the air (see below). In fact, 
frequent suggestions that traditional leaders would get (back) land only made 
the question of Khoisan leadership more contested (Bateman 2016).
Not surprisingly therefore, delegates declared open season on the nkc at 
Kimberley One. Many were angered by their involvement with land issues as 
their mandate was restricted to constitutional recognition (Tania Kleinhans-​
Cedras, 14/​10/​2014). Others felt the nkc did not represent them and wanted to 
replace it with a new organization (enn 2014e, 6). One critic felt it ultimately 
bore responsibility for the ‘disorder, corruption and opportunism’ among the 
Khoisan (enn 2014e, 6). The government’s calls for ‘unity among the Khoisan’ 
were therefore quite cynical, he concluded. Others too saw the nkc as a way 
for the state to sow division among the Khoisan (enn 2013a, 6). In our inter­
view, Cecil Le Fleur (10/​07/​2019) acknowledged the nkc had not lived up to 
expectations. Engaging with Khoisan revivalists made him appreciate how for­
tunate he was to be born into the culture and never had to ‘revive’. It was never 
foreseen that so many Khoisan revivalists would come to the fore, but the nkc 
could only call so many elections. Le Fleur also blamed the government for 
not providing funding to improve communications with constituents while 
simultaneously interacting with other structures claiming to represent the 
Khoisan (enn 2013a, 6; 2014g, 14). Newcomers are understandably frustrated 
with the status quo, but piecemeal progress was the only way their grievances 
would get addressed according to Le Fleur. Chantal Revell (07/​03/​2018) was 
initially among the nkc’s critics but realized nkc-​related disputes were a red 
herring; they provide the government with a reason to halt negotiations with 
the Khoisan while moving forward with land reform in the country at large. 
The Reference Group was in her view a deliberate attempt to foment discord 
among the Khoisan. A meeting to clarify their roles descended into chaos, with 
government officials reportedly refusing to intervene. While the drdlr stated 
it only dealt with land issues, its consultation process had intertwined them 
with contestations and legislative developments regarding Khoisan leadership 
(see below), putting the Reference Group and the nkc at loggerheads.

As the Reference Group relentlessly criticized the nkc, it ironically faced 
similar problems and accusations. Ron Martin gave an update in enn in 2014 
(enn 2014a, 2) regarding progress made with identifying heritages sites, con­
ceptualizing ‘capacity-​building and development projects’ and formulating 
policy suggestions. In a presentation at Kimberley Two, held on 10–​11 April 2014, 
Martin also listed several sites for consideration, including Table Mountain, 
Genadendal, and the Castle of Good Hope (Martin 2014). Some, including the 
nkc, however claimed the Reference Group had not reported back to its con­
stituents (enn 2014d, 2–​3). In its defence, like the nkc, the Reference Group 
cited a lack of resources and the fact that the government was speaking to 
multiple groups simultaneously (enn 2013e, 6; 2014e, 11; irasa 2017, 3). The 
bulk of exchanges within the Reference Group reportedly revolved around 
locating affordable venues to have meetings and calculating the cheapest 
mode of transport or communication. Once again mirroring allegations lev­
elled against the nkc, some felt unjustly excluded from the Reference Group 
and demanded membership or that it be dissolved (enn 2014e, 11). Many also 
put forward a vote of no confidence against Witbooi, the Reference Group 
chairman, for overtly campaigning for the anc at Kimberley Two (Chantal 
Revell, 25/​11/​2014; enn 2014d, 3). Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras (05/​01/​2015) blamed 
Witbooi for turning the gathering into a ‘cultural concert’, with Nama heritage 
in particular being emphasized thanks to his lobbying. There was little time 
for actual negotiations about land as a result, to the great frustration of those 
attending (enn 2014d, 3).
The drdlr meanwhile contracted independent researchers in 2013 to con­
duct a ‘Regulatory Impact Assessment’ (ria) regarding the new land claims 
process, exceptions to the 1913 cut-​off date, and Khoisan land issues. The two-​
volume ria report perhaps provides the background of the drdlr’s policy pref­
erences (see below). The report, which is not publicly available, is partly based 
on meetings with ‘stakeholders’ in various provinces but not the Western Cape 
(drdlr 2013, 193–​199). Like Ntsewa and others, the authors find ‘first nation 
status’ inappropriate for the South African context as Africans arrived there 
virtually simultaneously and experienced the same degree of dispossession 
and violence at the hands of European settlers (ibid., 24, 133). Yet the Khoisan 
endured ‘the most violent of forms of dispossession including genocide’ and 
could therefore possibly qualify as ‘vulnerable indigenous people’ (ibid., 18, 133; 
see above). Pre-​1913 land claims are ‘politically and economically unbearable’ 
as all land in South Africa would become claimable, including where cases have 
already been settled (drdlr 2013, 149, 186–​187). According to oddly precise 
figures from consultancy firm ‘Urban-​Econ’, scrapping the cut-​off date would 
prompt ‘23,170 claims from traditional Khoi-​San provinces’ involving 500.000

Khoisan descendants (ibid., 25, 40). The authors also warned how ‘politically 
organised and assertive Khoe and San groups’ might feign Khoisan indigeneity 
to access benefits (ibid., 191). As the 1997 White Paper already suggested 16 years 
earlier (Department of Land Affairs 1997, 14–​15), the ria report recommends 
instead to amend the 1993 Provision of Land and Assistance Act to prioritize 
the Khoisan in the land redistribution process (drdlr 2013, 187–​189). Revised 
heritage legislation could also give the Khoisan a greater sense of ownership, 
‘sense of place’ and ability to practice ‘indigenous cultural heritage’ (ibid., 147, 
187–​189). ‘Symbolic gestures/​remedies’, such as renaming towns or roads with 
‘former or new Khoe and San terminologies’ were also options (ibid., 151).
While Reference Group members claimed the ria’s historical narrative 
could be debunked with research ‘of our own’, they relinquished earlier posi­
tions such as a 1652 cut-​off date and endorsed identical recommendations 
regarding land redistribution at Kimberley Two (enn 2014a, 2; 2014b, 2). The 
Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Act, whose announcement had put 
in motion the whole process, was passed two months after Kimberley Two, 
and no longer mentioned the Khoisan.37 The drdlr for their part acknowl­
edged that heritage sites and ‘historical landmarks’ –​ the distinction was never 
clarified –​ needed to be returned to ‘the owners of the heritage and history’, 
but did not specify much beyond that (Mdontswa 2014). While Kimberley Two 
was once again touted as a significant milestone, the Khoisan were even less 
in agreement this time around and wondered why they had been asked for 
feedback in the first place.38 Some felt the Kimberley meetings only served to 
keep up appearances and that the outcomes had been predetermined (enn 
2014e, 11). Others accused the anc of perpetuating a ‘white colonialist agenda’ 
by seeking to capture Khoisan politics, and likened the chaos of the Reference 
Group to the divide-​and-​rule tactics allegedly applied through the nkc (enn 
2014e, 6). Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras claims the Reference Group was rushed to 
reach recommendations and that few of her colleagues suggested pilot proj­
ects because they were too busy campaigning for the anc (irasa 2017, 4).
As agreed during Kimberley Two, a meeting was called in Arniston on 14 
June 2015 where Khoisan representatives were asked to elect 60 delegates for 
the next national dialogue (enn 2017a, 6). Heated exchanges ensued over who

should be included and excluded (Chantal Revell, 19/​08/​2019). A drdlr official 
reportedly made the potentially game-​changing statement that the Khoisan 
would no longer need to prove ‘ancestral ownership’ to file land claims and 
that proving a link to the land would suffice, but this apparently got lost in the 
thick of the fray (Khoisan 2015a). Plans for Kimberley Three were put on hold 
in the wake of the chaotic Arniston meeting, but a pilot land redistribution 
project was at some point launched in Wellington. An enn (2017a, 6) respon­
dent reports that Nkwinti promised the project would bring sustained bene­
fits to all Khoisan, but many criticized the fact that Witbooi and other Nama 
were ‘put in charge’. The trust set up to manage the property reportedly turned 
into a ‘nightmare of greed and personal enrichment’ according to the same 
source. Its current state is unknown. In September 2018, drdlr staff organized 
a ‘study tour’ to ‘draw lessons from Canadian experiences regarding redress for 
land alienation from the indigenous people and processes for reconciliation’.39 
One of the explicit purposes was to reflect on the cut-​off date and the plight 
of the Khoisan, yet little was suggested beyond the general recommendation 
that the South African government ‘should consider prioritising addressing 
the land needs of the descendants of the Khoi & Sans [sic] in terms of the 
Redistribution programme’, a suggestion already made in 1997 (see above).
Despite this apparent long-​time consensus, land redistribution legislation 
has not been revised to date. Zuma announced in 2015 that the Khoisan would 
be able to claim land in the next five years, but it was not clear what he was 
referring to (Zuma 2015). This has not made land any less of an animating issue 
for Khoisan revivalists. The anc’s policy U-​turn regarding the ‘willing buyer, 
willing seller’ principle in February 2018 has in fact made it more volatile than 
ever before. Widely seen as the result of pressure from the opposition and a 
poor showing in the 2016 local elections (Adebayo 2019, 139), the anc now 
endorses expropriating land without compensation to ‘fast-​track land reform’ 
and achieve ‘radical economic transformation’. Although it remains unclear 
how this policy will be implemented, it is advertised as a way of transfer­
ring property from Whites to landless Blacks. As I show in Chapter 5 and the 
Conclusion, many Khoisan fear being side-​lined and look to an unprecedented 
degree for leverage in arguments of prior occupancy and indigeneity. Deputy-​
Minister of the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs 
(cogta), Obed Bapela, however advised the government in 2016 ‘not [to] go

into the temptation of giving [the Khoisan] first-​nation status’ as it stimulated 
secessionism and applied only to Latin America and Canada, ‘where people 
were completely removed from their land and some arrived and settled there’ 
(Makinana 2016). In South Africa by contrast, he argued, ‘we do not know who 
arrived at which point, when and where’ and land was still held by the Khoisan 
‘together with other indigenous people of Africa’. Similar statements have been 
made by others, but it should be evident at this point that despite ambiguous 
statements by officials, the government is not intent on granting the Khoisan 
the exclusive status of indigenous people or entertaining land claims based on 
prior occupancy.40
Yet this does not mean that Khoisan grievances are no longer on the govern­
ment’s radar or that the issue has been settled. After several years of receiving 
complaints, the sahrc decided in 2015 to look into the matter once again (see 
above). A series of public hearings were held in Gauteng, the Western Cape, 
and the Northern Cape in 2015–​2017, which formed the basis for the report 
that was released in 2018 (sahrc 2018, 8). The investigation was instigated by 
the late Danny Titus, who headed the sahrc at the time. Chris Nissen, who 
was born and raised in Cape Town and at one time led the anc in the Western 
Cape, succeeded Titus as commissioner. Both men are openly supportive of 
Khoisan revivalism. Nissen in particular has reflected on Khoisan issues for 
some time. He wrote his ma thesis on the ‘supposed loss of the Khoikhoi tra­
ditional religious heritage amongst it descendants’ at the University of Cape 
Town in 1990 (Nissen 1990; my emphasis). The thesis advances a revival­
ist argument: Khoisan religiosity has survived colonialism and apartheid in 
altered shape, and this realization should give Khoisan descendants a ‘digni­
fied continuation with their forbearers’ (ibid., ii; see Chapter 4). Nissen did 
not want ‘the history to die’ and so deliberately chose this ‘subversive’ topic 
(Chris Nissen, 21/​05/​2018). He personally believes the Khoisan need increased 
access to land in order to make them feel more part of South African society, 
this despite some making ‘a mockery’ of things by making outlandish claims. 
Nissen fears this distracts from the burning question of indigeneity: ‘It is politi­
cally convenient for government to say everyone is indigenous [but] some peo­
ple are indigenous to specific parts of Africa’.
The sahrc report (2018, 17) however endorses a slightly adapted version of 
the vulnerable indigenous people argument: all African groups may be consid­
ered indigenous, but the concept ‘indigenous’ should be used as a parameter

to measure the continued marginalization of the Khoisan, not to one-​up and 
exclude other groups in society based on ‘ethnic, cultural or racial distinction’. 
One wonders where marginalization derives from if not some type of distinc­
tion. Indeed, the report argues that the Khoisan merit special attention because 
they remain ‘virtually invisible as a distinct group’ due to a history of forced 
assimilation, classification as Coloured, and overall denied dignity as ‘a people 
of equal worth and value’ (ibid., 9). It recommends a wide range of measures 
to accommodate their grievances, not only including debunking stereotypes; 
reinvigorating the Khoisan Heritage Route; creating ‘cultural information cen­
tres, museums and tourism initiatives’; but also greater access to ‘ancestral 
land’; and an ‘official and legally recognized existence as a distinct group’ by 
ending their de facto categorization as Coloured (sahrc 2018, 47, 67–​71, 81–​
82, 85, 91–​92). While Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras (11/​07/​2018) believes the report 
does not go far enough, mainly by being imprecise about what ‘recognizing 
the Khoisan’ entails in practice, it is the most pro-​Khoisan official document to 
date. It has already spurred the government to promise the option ‘Khoisan’ in 
the census of 2021 as well as in ‘all government forms’ (dta 2019, 4). As Nissen 
reminded the Khoisan revivalists attending the official release of the report in 
Cape Town on 22 March 2018, the report should be seen as ‘a living, working 
document’.
The passage of the Traditional and Khoi-​San Leadership Act (tkla) in 
Parliament on 26 February 2019 however took away any lasting doubts regard­
ing the recognition of Khoisan traditional leaders.41 Drafts of the tkla circu­
lated for comment in 2011, 2013, and 2015, and several public hearings were 
convened (De Wet 2012, 504; enn 2016b, 1). Khoisan revivalists were quick to 
react to the drafts, crucial sections of which were published in enn (2013d, 
4–​5). One contributor believed the tkla advanced ‘decolonization’ and 
brought ‘hope for the restoration of peoples’ cultural identity’ (enn 2015, 11). 
Although they shared critical feedback on earlier drafts, such as renaming the 
Act ‘National Traditional and First Indigenous Khoi and San Affairs Bill’, the 
nkc also endorsed the tkla (enn 2013d, 2, 7). They had been instrumental to 
the drafting process, but were also keen on securing a consultative role there­
after, something many Khoisan opposed (ibid., 6). The government has already 
requested the assistance of the nkc with identifying communities that could

It is noteworthy that the Western Cape was the only province that voted against the bill. 
Siv Øvernes (2019, 93) argues that they did so because ‘different criteria were used when 
it concerned recognising the Khoisan [and] too much power would be in the hands of 
Khoisan leaders and councils, especially when it came to how land would to be utilised’. 
It should be noted that the tkla does not stipulate anything about controlling land.

qualify for recognition; in what way and whether in the capacity of a statutory 
body remains to be seen (dta 2019, 6; see also sahrc 2018, 57, 60). As stip­
ulated in the tkla, these community representatives may in turn apply for 
recognition with the ‘Commission on Khoi-​San Matters’, which will operate 
similar to the Commission on Traditional Leadership Disputes and Claims –​ 
the so-​called Nhlapo Commission –​ that previously validated the claims of 
non-​Khoisan traditional leaders (Ainslie and Kepe 2016, 23). The government 
issued a call for nominations in April 2019 and up to seven members with rele­
vant experience and without affiliation to any Khoisan collective will staff the 
commission.42
Those that support the tkla are eclipsed by those who thoroughly reject 
it.43 Criticism comes in a variety of forms and relates to various issues. Whereas 
Le Fleur expressed his dismay at once again merely being a guest at the House 
of Traditional Leaders in 2018 (Le Fleur 2018), most Khoisan dread the prospect 
of local, provincial, and national Houses of ‘traditional and Khoi-​San leaders’ 
(tkla, 70; my emphasis). These government-​funded entities will host elected 
traditional and Khoisan leaders fulfilling largely ceremonial and advisory roles 
for five-​year terms (ibid., 77–​78, 82, 90). Most Khoisan do not take issue with 
this but fear to be in a perpetual minority position as a result of having to 
share seats with non-​Khoisan members (William Langeveldt, 12/​03/​2018). The 
Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa (contralesa), a non-​govern­
mental entity founded in 1987 to organize the resistance of traditional leaders 
against the apartheid regime, for its part endorsed ‘claims by the Khoisan peo­
ple and those dispossessed before 1913’ and asked the government to speed up 
‘getting the land back to its rightful owners’ in 2013.44 Aaron Messelaar (16/​
03/​2018), who I say more about in Chapter 4, joined Contralesa as the only 
Khoisan member in 2007 and claims it supported Khoisan revivalism from

the onset as they want to empower traditional leadership wherever they can. 
Those who see a contradiction between the concepts ‘indigenous’ and ‘tradi­
tional’ are therefore mistaken, he argues (Aaron Messelaar, 06/​10/​2017).
And yet, Rico Settler has noted how traditional leaders have increasingly 
been associated with the global indigenous rights movement and the ‘rhetoric 
of the ancestral’ in order to bolster their claims (Settler 2010, 59). Perhaps this 
also played a role in the fierce opposition to earlier drafts of the tkla that 
referred to all parties as ‘traditional leaders’ (enn 2015, 2). Not mentioning 
the Khoisan in the title not only compromised their political influence, it also 
impeded addressing predicaments that are specifically related to their indige­
neity (Gabie 2014, 26). Some felt the tkla ought to have addressed the ‘cultural 
and physical genocide’ of the Khoisan (enn 2013d, 8; 2014g, 8). Khoisan reviv­
alists also regret that the tkla makes no mention of indigenous rights, the 
ilo 169 or undrip (enn 2013d, 6; 2017c, 15). On this point, the tkla is crys­
tal clear: it does not bestow upon anyone ‘any special indigenous, first nation 
or any other similar status’ (tkla, 10). Furthermore, whereas President Cyril 
Ramaphosa celebrated the legislation for granting ‘statutory recognition to the 
Khoi-​San […] one of South Africa’s indigenous groups’, it only speaks to the 
issue of traditional leadership.45 As Zenzile Khoisan (24/​05/​2018) noted, no 
Khoisan are recognized by the tkla beyond a set of government-​approved 
‘chiefs’. These representatives are moreover not constitutionally recognized 
but reliant on legislation that could be repealed in the future (Peter Marais, 
02/​07/​2018).
The criteria for the recognition of Khoisan traditional leaders are also under 
fire. The tkla defines a ‘Khoi-​San’ person as anyone who ‘lives in accordance 
with the customs and customary law’ of any of the five groupings identified 
in the sqr (tkla, 8; see above). ‘Customs and customary law’ need to be suf­
ficiently distinct and in line with the constitution and other criteria set out 
in the tkla, such as gender equality (tkla, 10). Khoisan communities also 
need to demonstrate a history of self-​identification ‘from a particular point in 
time up to the present’ and occupy ‘a specific geographical area or various geo­
graphical areas’ (ibid., 20). Some find this ignores the history of forced assim­
ilation and dispersal as well as the complexities of a process of revival (enn 
2013d, 2; 2017a, 13). The fact that ‘customs and customary law’ and ‘a particular 
point in time’ is open to interpretation, and that both elected and hereditary

leaders qualify might however work in their favour (tkla, 20). Then again, 
the tkla upholds different hierarchies for Khoisan and ‘traditional leaders’. 
The latter is made up of Kings, Queens, Principle Traditional Leaders, Senior 
Traditional Leaders, and Headmen and Headwomen, while the former only 
consists of Senior Khoi-​San Leaders and Branch Heads (ibid., 12, 18). A Khoisan 
‘royal house’ did not make it into the final version (enn 2013d, 6). The mean­
ing of these various appellations is once again left largely unspecified. Much 
is left to the discretion of the premier of the respective province, including 
remuneration and potentially assigning additional advisory roles (tkla, 48, 
64, 68). The aforementioned Commission scrutinizes claims and makes rec­
ommendations, but the final verdict rests with the premier and the Minister 
of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (ibid., 96). Many Khoisan 
wonder what the rationale behind this decision is and why the premier holds 
so much power, not least because they feel those of the Western Cape have 
ignored them for decades (enn 2013e, 5; 2014i, 12; Aaron Messelaar, 06/​10/​
2017). Moreover, many, including the sahrc (2018, 81), judge it unfair that tra­
ditional leaders get automatic ‘authority’ over people within their boundaries 
whereas Khoisan leaders need to supply the premier with an annually updated 
list of members replete with their signatures and explicit consent (tkla, 18–​
20, 24; sahrc 2018, 58–​59). All of this makes many Khoisan revivalists defiant 
of any government involvement in defining Khoisan communities and leader­
ship (enn 2014g, 8; 2014j, 12; Joseph Little, 08/​05/​2018; sahrc 2018, 58).
The emotions accompanying rejections of the tkla are profound. A 2016 
clip circulating on Facebook for example showed Khoisan throwing copies 
of the tkla on the floor before storming out of a public hearing in George. 
Clearly agitated by the subject during our interview, Khoisan activist Tanyan 
Gradwell (31/​07/​2019) rejected the tkla as ‘an apartheid Bill’ that needs to be 
condemned by the international criminal court as it seeks to co-​opt their lead­
ership in order to be able to control them. Another group blasted the ‘heinous 
Euro-​colonial, White-​apartheid and Black neo-​colonial’ tkla and warned it 
might turn the Khoisan into ‘liberation fighters’ (wclksc 2018, 2–​3). As some­
one with a finger on the pulse of Khoisan revivalism, Zenzile Khoisan (12/​
06/​2018) repeatedly cautioned this might be the last generation of peaceful 
Khoisan revivalists (see also enn 2016b, 1). The threat of violence was issued at 
a public hearing on the tkla in Parliament on 8 May 2018, which I attended.46

standby to prove it if need be. To great cheers of his supporters, Van Wyk added 
he did not need ‘government to tell me who I am’ and was insulted for ‘being 
assimilated into Nguni tribes’ through the tkla. Even more applause was gen­
erated when speakers criticized the government for negating Coloureds’ con­
tributions to the struggle or when they asserted the Khoisan had sole authority 
over the land as indigenous people. Hardly anyone commented on the con­
tents of the tkla but rejected it out of hand. Their allotted speaking time was 
filled with history lessons and passionate pleas to embrace Khoisan indige­
neity. The chairman’s attempts to restore order to the meeting were met with 
boos and jeers from the crowd.
Before concluding this chapter, I want to contrast this episode with another 
meeting I attended on 1 August 2019 at the Castle of Good Hope regarding an 
imminent benefit-​sharing agreement between the nkc, the South African 
San Council, and the South African Rooibos Council. Despite many rooibos 
companies explicitly branding their products with references to the Khoisan, 
this was never accompanied by a recognition that the Khoisan were the tra­
ditional knowledge holders (Wynberg 2017, 46). The deal that was about to 
be signed was nine years in the making and did exactly that (Jansen 2016; 
456; see also Ives 2017, 5–​7). One of the main sources of inspiration for the 
agreement was a settlement the San and sasi had reached in 2003 concerning 
Hoodia, an appetite-​supressing plant (Comaroff and Comaroff 2009, 90).47 At 
the time of the meeting, the nkc could not yet disclose the details, but it later 
emerged that 1.5 percent of proceeds from Rooibos sales, which could amount 
to R10 million per annum, would henceforth go to the nkc and the South 
African San Council.48 The purpose of the gathering in August was to get input 
from Khoisan representatives on what that money could best be used for. The 
conveners particularly wanted feedback on their suggestion to set up a ‘Khoi 
trust’ where people could apply to fund projects that benefit the community 
(Chantal Revell, 10/​07/​2019). The meeting however ended up revolving almost 
entirely around whether the nkc had the appropriate mandate to negotiate 
the rooibos settlement –​ a recurrent theme, as overall criticism of the nkc had

the table felt there had not been enough prior public consultation and declared 
the rooibos negotiations null and void. One veteran nkc member tried to dis­
credit his detractors by noting that they were not around when the nkc was 
formed. Zenzile Khoisan attempted several times to lower the temperature by 
stating that leadership issues could be left for another meeting and that it was 
worthwhile to at least listen to the offer that was on the table in the meantime. 
While the nkc eventually managed to explain its plans for the trust, the meet­
ing ended without any feedback. Many of those who came to the meeting were 
apparently predetermined to use the occasion to admonish the nkc.
Whereas the tkla hearing was a rare show of unity among a group that is 
marred by infighting, the rooibos meeting illustrates how detrimental conflicts 
are to moving Khoisan revivalism forward. The income from rooibos brings 
unforeseen financial means to advance Khoisan revivalism, but the endemic 
distrust of the nkc put any agreement over how to manage the funding out of 
reach. Whether the common enemy is the government or the nkc (or both), 
their critics are divided as well. As I noted, Khoisan revivalists share the assess­
ment that the promise of paid leadership positions and land claims exacer­
bated already existing tensions (enn 2014f, 8). For all to see, Khoisan revivalism 
is still trapped in a cycle of fierce infighting and heartfelt pleas for unity (cf. 
Adhikari 2004, 186; Worden 2009, 28; Sato 2018, 206). The situation is all the 
more depressing since, as Basil Coetzee (2019b, 246) realized looking back at 
decades of attempting to rally conflicting parties, ‘the more efforts were made 
to unify and consolidate, the more divisive we became’. Many are painfully 
aware that they duplicate each other’s work and stall political negotiations 
or, even worse, provide the government with a scapegoat (irasa 2012, 13; enn 
2013a, 12; 2014j, 12). Government officials have indeed cited infighting as one of 
the reasons to delay policy developments.49 While certain government officials 
have also backed efforts to establish unity (enn 2014g, 5), their involvement is 
often rejected out of hand, perhaps due to previous experiences with the nkc 
or the Reference Group (enn 2014j, 12; 2017b, 1–​2). As I show in greater detail in 
Chapter 5, infighting is both diagnosed and remedied in a variety of ways.
Those that feared the tkla will divide the Khoisan further might be proven 
right when the Commission on Khoi-​San Matters commences its work for a 
period of five years. Nissen (21/​05/​2018) felt infighting prevented a critical mass 
from materializing and that the government will control Khoisan revivalism’s

development through state-​appointed leaders. However, it is my impression 
that the number of Khoisan revivalists has increased dramatically in recent 
years. Amplified by social media and endorsed by prominent Coloureds, such 
as ex-​Cape Town mayor Peter Marais and the suspended anc politician Marius 
Fransman, Khoisan revivalism seems more popular now than ever before (see 
Conclusion). Several Khoisan political parties have also been founded, such 
as the ‘true Khoisan party’ Patriotic Alliance or the First Nation Liberation 
Alliance, which emphasises ‘aboriginality’ (enn 2014b, 12; 2014c, 3; see also De 
Wet 2012, 504). Besides a few advertisements in enn, no additional informa­
tion is available. None managed to gain any seats, with the possible exception 
of Khoisan Revolution, created in 2016 by Stanley Pieterse, a Northern Cape 
Khoisan representative who also sits on the nkc (Parkinson 2016b). The party 
reportedly has 25,000 paid members and contested the 2016 local elections 
with a campaign centred on land, recognition, and language rights for the 
Khoisan and won one seat in Springbok in the Northern Cape, where it formed 
a coalition with the anc (Jansen 2017, 55). While not translated into votes for 
Khoisan political parties, Khoisan revivalist entities have mushroomed across 
Cape Town and many speak of a ‘mass phenomenon’ (enn 2014i, 12). It is 
indeed turning into what is perhaps best described as a broad-​based identity 
movement. As Khoisan revivalism gained traction, articulations of Khoisan 
indigeneity diversified. The following chapters will show how the majority of 
those that come to find Khoisan identity and culture empowering and help­
ful in understanding the world around them are not necessarily interested 
in joining tribal structures or getting recognized as traditional leaders. They 
relate to their Khoisan identity in different ways. To be able to understand this, 
I explained in the Introduction that it is vital to exchange the concept ‘indig­
enous’ for ‘articulations of indigeneity’ as an analytical lens. In other words, 
one needs to take an in-​depth look at what Khoisan revivalists are doing and 
saying; where, how, and when the Khoisan past is engaged with, and not least, 
why. In Part 2, I aim to do just that by presenting the bulk of my empirical data.

The Khoisan Identity Discourse (i)
Reclaiming History and Remedying the ‘Identity Crisis’
The history of our people has been lost, stolen, strayed and dis­
torted and now, as a resurgent nation, rising from our valley of dry 
bones, where we must knit together a cohesive story of who we are 
as a people, where we come from and who we are now. It is the story 
of our existence, our travails and our triumphs. This is our cohesive 
narrative that must be sensitively put together as we chart our path­
way to a future where we are recognised and restored.
zenzile khoisan (enn 2014j, 6)
∵
When I asked my interlocutors about their identity, the resulting ‘Khoisan 
identity discourse’, as I will refer to it, was typically premised on a rejection of 
the racial label Coloured. Given the history I detailed previously, this should 
not come as a surprise. The apartheid dispensation actively suppressed 
Khoisan identity among Coloureds, particularly in urban environments 
such as Cape Town. While many remained aware of their Khoisan ances­
try, assimilationist ideology ensured that the majority of Coloureds fronted 
their European ancestry while reluctantly acknowledging themselves as 
products of miscegenation. The Khoisan extinction discourse also cut off 
any linkages between Coloured identity and the Khoisan by casting the for­
mer as virtually extinct. In this sense, everything associated with Coloured 
identity runs anathema to Khoisan revivalism. However, when the earliest 
Khoisan revivalists began challenging Coloured identity alongside other crit­
ics in the 1970s and 1980s, they all had come to at least partially experience 
their lives through such a lens, since apartheid did not just assign labels but 
impacted everything from where one lived to the minutiae of everyday life. 
Moreover, although segregationist policies have been discontinued, racial 
labels like Coloured continue to imbue life in the post-​apartheid era, includ­
ing for Khoisan revivalists. Michael Besten (2006, 349) understood as much 
when he noted that they did not just reject Coloured identity but seemingly

affirmed it by defining Khoisan identity in opposition to Black and White. 
Katharina Schramm (2016, 138) likewise found that ‘[t]‌he political subjectiv­
ity as a Khoesan descendant is thus intimately linked to a collective memory 
of apartheid discrimination under the label “coloured”’. While any associa­
tion with the term might be strongly opposed and various other influences 
are discernible, Khoisan revivalists’ articulations of indigeneity are thus 
inescapability related to past and present experiences of being known as 
Coloured. The aim of the three chapters that make up Part 2 is to scrutinize 
the bulk of my empirical data in an effort to examine why, when, and how 
Khoisan revivalists’ articulations of indigeneity are constituted by, among 
others, an intertwining of historical Khoisan representations, notions of 
indigeneity and Coloured identity.
The focus in Chapter 6 is on what Khoisan revivalists do in practice, but 
this chapter and the next tackle the Khoisan identity discourse alluded to 
above, that is, how Khoisan revivalists ‘knit together a cohesive story’ of their 
being, as Zenzile Khoisan put it. What do they mean when they speak of and 
narrate their indigeneity in relation to their Khoisan identity? Identity is to 
a large extent individualized and the aspects of the Khoisan identity dis­
course I delineate might not resonate with each and every Khoisan revivalist. 
Notwithstanding individual discrepancies and keeping in mind the method­
ological limits of my approach (see Chapter 1), I maintain that the fieldwork-​
induced themes that structure this chapter and the next are the core elements 
of how most Khoisan revivalists discursively shape their indigeneity. In this 
chapter, I focus on emic interpretations of the Khoisan past and the com­
monplace that Coloureds suffer from an ‘identity crisis’. In the first subchap­
ter, I scrutinize testimonials from Khoisan revivalists regarding the origins of, 
and motivations for, their embrace of Khoisan identity and attitude towards 
Coloured identity. I show how appeals to the Khoisan past are viewed as the 
remedy to the identity crisis. In the second subchapter, I look more closely at 
how Khoisan revivalists relate to the past in relation to contemporary circum­
stances and needs. The first section examines the widespread assessment that 
Khoisan history has been distorted and needs to be reclaimed and rewritten, 
with an emphasis on emphasizing continuities between past and present. In 
the following section, I take a closer look at some of the historical works and 
initiatives Khoisan revivalists have produced to cultivate an historical interpre­
tation along these lines. In the third section, I hone in on a specific dimension 
of these types of engagements: the search for meaning in the past by focusing 
on specific historical figures. I take the 17th century Khoisan woman Krotoa 
as a case study as she seems to be the most popular reference in this regard. 
I extend the discussion on historical continuities to Chapter 5, where I discuss

The Khoisan Identity Discourse (i)
151
how the Khoisan identity discourse is informed by notions of empowerment, 
land claims, and traditional leadership.
4.1	
‘Khoisan forever, Coloured never’: Khoisan Identity as the Answer 
to the Identity Crisis
‘Khoisan forever, Coloured never’. I came across this slogan early on in my ma 
research. I first saw it written on a placard at the house of Tania Kleinhans-​
Cedras. I later learned it was the same sign which she and other irasa mem­
bers had used during the //​Hui !Gaeb protest in 2012 (see Chapter 3). At the 
time of my fieldwork in 2014, her home functioned as the base of operations 
for irasa. Kleinhans-​Cedras showed me several signs and posters with similar 
messaging that afternoon, but the statement ‘Khoisan forever, Coloured never’ 
in particular seems to have struck a chord with Khoisan revivalists. I have 
heard it being chanted at events and protests, but I also noticed it in various 
newspaper articles and academic publications (see e.g. Brown and Deumert 
2017, 575). The phrase indeed encapsulates one of the central –​ and perhaps 
most controversial to some –​ tenets of Khoisan revivalism: that Khoisan reviv­
alists ‘were’ never Coloured but always Khoisan. The slogan epitomizes the 
outright rejection of anything associated with Coloured identity, a term that 
is dismissed by many Khoisan revivalists as an apartheid-​era imposition that 
is deliberately devoid of connotations of indigeneity and emphasizes miscege­
nation and rootlessness instead.
Just like it is common these days to refer to ‘the k-​word’ instead of using the 
highly derogatory term kaffir to refer to Blacks, Francisco MacKenzie (Mackie), 
the author of the slogan ‘Khoisan forever, Coloured never’, believes people 
should speak of ‘the c-​concept’ instead of Coloured (Mackie, 05/​07/​2018). 
As I noted in Chapter 3, Mackie discarded the Coloured label after a series of 
encounters made him reflect on his roots and reconsider how he identifies. Ever 
since, he has been committed to convincing other Coloureds that they should 
identify as Khoisan, as Coloured identity is a form of ‘false consciousness’. 
Mackie (16/​17/​2018), who regards himself as a ‘historian, historical researcher’, 
not only strives to achieve this through his public appearances in irasa-​spon­
sored activities, or more recently in his capacity as a founding member of the 
Western Cape Khoisan Legislative Council (see Chapter 5), but also during 
daily encounters with strangers on the streets, at restaurants, or on the train. 
As I was chatting to Mackie (02/​07/​2018) over breakfast at Zevenwacht Mall in 
July 2018, he for instance ordered ‘Khoisan tea’ instead of rooibos tea, as the bev­
erage was listed on the menu. He used this reference to the Khoisan in order to

Chapter 4
make the waitress –​ whom he clearly identified as Coloured, perhaps because 
she spoke Afrikaans –​ reflect on her roots and to make a larger point about 
Khoisan claims to rooibos tea (see Chapter 3). Mackie also referenced the gap 
in her teeth, noting it was not a common cultural practice among Coloureds 
but that it dates back to the forced removal of front teeth to make it impossible 
to pronounce the click sounds in Khoekhoegowab. Whether or not his claims 
are factually correct is not my concern, the point is rather that Mackie delib­
erately weaves past and present together to ‘conscientize’ potential Khoisan 
revivalists. As he explained to me on a later occasion, the most effective way 
to achieve this is by making people question the myth that Coloureds are ‘Jan 
van Riebeeck’s bastaards’, that is, the illegitimate offspring of unions between 
Europeans and locals (Mackie, 16/​07/​2018). Like many other Khoisan revival­
ists, Mackie insists that Khoisan ancestry is not diluted by the addition of exog­
enous genetic markers: ‘Who were you before [the Population Registration Act 
of 1950]? If you accept the Coloured label you have to accept you have no exis­
tence prior to that date, no claim to the land no history, nothing […] It means 
you came with Jan van Riebeeck’.
Together with many others, Mackie therefore wants to have the term 
Coloured officially scrapped.1 To be sure, not all Khoisan revivalists are as 
fiercely opposed to the notion of Coloured identity as Mackie. Rochey Walters 
(18/​05/​2018) personally dislikes the term, but does not want it to be abolished 
because he acknowledges that others have an emotional attachment to it and 
do not see it as an imposed or negative identity. In her study of Griqua iden­
tity in the Northern Cape, Linda Waldman (2007b, 114) also found that some 
simultaneously embraced Coloured and Griqua identity. For many, the opposi­
tion or difference between the two is not absolute. Moreover, given the demo­
graphic history of the Cape, one wonders whether Khoisan revivalists believe 
that all Coloureds can claim a Khoisan identity and if certain members of 
other groups potentially could not –​ a topic I elaborate on in the next chapter. 
However, regardless of how criticizing Coloured identity relates to boundaries 
of Khoisan identity, all of my interlocutors echoed Mackie’s assessment that 
Coloured identity is problematic and that relating to the Khoisan past is nec­
essary to understand, resist, and resolve a wide range of present-​day predica­
ments. More specifically, it is common among Khoisan revivalists to diagnose 
that centuries of assimilation have resulted not just in a loss of identity, but in

The Khoisan Identity Discourse (i)
153
an ‘identity crisis’ among Coloureds, which in turn causes many of the social 
ills and challenges in their communities.
Before probing this reasoning in greater detail, it is important to under­
score that not all Coloureds consider their identities to be (particularly) prob­
lematic (see e.g. Erasmus and Pieterse 1999, 176, 179). Many proudly identify 
as Coloured. Others sympathize with Khoisan revivalism or recognize their 
Khoisan ancestry but hold on to their Coloured identity (Rockman 2017). 
Moreover, the claim that Coloureds suffer as a result of being uncertain about 
their identities is not only advanced by Khoisan revivalists (see e.g. Field 1998, 
232; see Chapter 2). In a well-​known piece, writer and academic Zoë Wicomb 
(1998, 100) for example argued that being ashamed of the various ‘origins’ of 
Coloured identity still causes a great deal of pain among Coloureds in the post-​
apartheid era. Others have also underlined the importance of debunking ste­
reotypes about Coloureds as prone to laziness, violence, alcoholism, and crime 
when considering the root causes of community afflictions (Petrus and Isaacs-​
Martin 2012, 88). Lastly, it is equally important to bear in mind that certain 
scholars have shown how struggling with identity has led Coloureds to pursue 
belonging in various non-​Khoisan related domains (at the same time) as well, 
ranging from African and European heritage, to Malay ancestry, and African-​
American culture (see e.g. Simone 1994; Yarwood 2006; McKaiser 2015).
While the notion of an identity crisis is therefore not unique to Khoisan 
revivalism, I found it to be particularly pronounced in the Khoisan identity 
discourse. Perhaps unbeknownst to him, an interlocutor who unexpectedly 
joined an interview I was conducting with Chantal Revell (07/​03/​2018) gave 
a succinct account of what can be considered a widely supported identity-​
crisis thesis. He pleaded with me to spread his assessment as it was vital the 
world understood how the identity crisis accounts for the violence and trauma 
Coloured communities are faced with. According to him, Coloureds ‘do not 
know who they are’ and are alienated from their ‘true identity’. They are taught 
to have no history or culture to speak of and therefore nothing to be proud of. 
This makes Coloureds recede into a state of nihilism, anger, and (self-​)destruc­
tion. Being stripped of any sense of indigeneity and regarding themselves as a 
bastardized people, many seek belonging in subcultures or organized crime. 
Yet he had no doubt that ‘a spiritual healing could come to them’ if only some­
one would make them aware of their unrecognized ‘wealthy inheritance’ as 
Khoisan. As I show in the remainder of this subchapter by scrutinizing various 
other emic perspectives on Khoisan identity, even though identities take shape 
in differing ways, convincing others, self-​alienation, spirituality, social ills, and 
healing are indeed all omnipresent in, and foundational to, the Khoisan iden­
tity discourse.

Chapter 4
4.1.1	
Identities Lost and Found: Khoisan Identity as a Spiritual Experience
I explain in Chapter 7 why the Khoisan identity discourse is not a complete 
refutation of the Khoisan extinction discourse, but the notion that the Khoisan 
are virtually extinct is of course rejected across the board. One of the most 
obvious counters is to increase the number of people who publicly identify as 
Khoisan. As the example of Mackie at the shopping mall illustrated, Khoisan 
revivalists aim to get as many people as possible to reflect on their Khoisan 
roots. irasa regularly advertises workshops and plays called ‘Who am I?’ on 
its social media page, which anyone can attend in order to discuss and med­
itate on their (Khoisan) identity. Acting as somewhat of a ‘safe space’ in this 
regard, since it is authored almost entirely by Khoisan revivalists, enn regu­
larly hosts a section entitled ‘Jou Komvandaan [your ancestry, that is, where 
one comes from]’ that explains how to carry out genealogical research (see e.g. 
enn 2013c, 12). Additionally, enn frequently publishes testimonials of Khoisan 
revivalists who thank those who got them to the point of embracing Khoisan 
identity (see e.g. enn 2014i, 4). These efforts are not without success as the vast 
majority of the people I interacted with were explicitly brought to Khoisan 
revivalism thanks to exposure to, or the help of, others. While social media, 
and in the case of Khoisan revivalism Facebook in particular, has amplified the 
reach of such messaging and recruitment drives, physical encounters and in-​
depth conversations seem to remain the most effective way at getting someone 
involved. Gregg Fick (16/​08/​2019), the founder of First Indigenous Nation of 
South Africa, for instance, began to mull over his identity after he saw Mackie 
brandishing his ‘Khoisan forever, Coloured never’ sign in central Cape Town in 
the early 2000s. Fick recalls how the encounter initially made him angry and 
confused, but how he eventually reflected on his upbringing in the Eastern 
Cape and more specifically on his grandmother, who he then realized had spo­
ken ‘the Khoisan language’. A sickly child, Fick remembered how his grand­
mother treated him with what must have been ‘a kind of Khoisan traditional 
medicine’. Years later, when he moved to Cape Town, and particularly towards 
the end of my fieldwork in 2019, Fick became an avid proselytiser of Khoisan 
revivalism himself, in his own words ‘re-​writing history and trying to restore 
pride in our communities’.
The snowball effect resulting from Khoisan revivalists recruiting others is 
well illustrated by the account of how Chantal Revell became involved with 
Khoisan issues. Her career as a Khoisan revivalist also shows where indigeneity 
becomes relevant once it is taken on board, as well as the spirituality that is 
commonly associated with the experience of affirming a newfound Khoisan

identity.2 It is therefore worthwhile looking into at some length with the help 
of autobiographical excerpts published in enn (2013a, 12; 2013b, 8; 2014i, 14; 
2015, 6) and Eland Nuus (2009a, 4), as well as a series of interviews I conducted 
with her over the span of several years (Chantal Revell, 07/​10/​2014; 25/​11/​2014; 
19/​08/​2019). Revell was born and raised in the township of Bishop Lavis, which 
she often described as a ‘a warzone’ in reference to the crime and violence 
that impacts daily life in the area. Her family took their Coloured identity for 
granted and never mentioned anything about the Khoisan. Looking back, 
Revell realized that ‘something was not right’ with the term Coloured for the 
first time during a school visit to the Castle of Good Hope when she was eight 
years old. As her class toured the complex, she was overcome by ‘a great sad­
ness’, particularly as they entered the ‘donker gat [dark hole]’, a space that had 
been used for centuries to torture prisoners (see also Bam-​Hutchison 2016, 
17). At the time, however, Revell did not understand what made her so upset. 
She joined anti-​apartheid protests as a teenager, but it is only after 1994 that 
she explicitly began to question Coloured identity, a label she had up to that 
point never felt entirely comfortable with, but had not vehemently rejected 
either. Like so many other Khoisan revivalists and Coloureds in general, Revell 
became disillusioned with the anc in the post-​apartheid era, believing them 
to be neglecting the contributions of Coloureds in dismantling apartheid and 
seemingly only validating the suffering and resistance efforts of Blacks (see 
below).
However, Revell only began to translate her dissatisfaction with Colouredness 
into an embrace of Khoisan identity in 2009, when a pastor by the name of 
Benjamin Wilson spoke at her church, the House of Benjamin in Elsies River, 
about the need for Coloureds to embrace their Khoisan ‘inheritance’. Wilson, 
who never became a prominent Khoisan revivalist or actively sought to spread 
his message beyond his church, explained to Revell that he had started to 
reflect on his Khoisan roots in the aftermath of Mbeki’s African Renaissance, 
which urged South Africans to take pride in their African heritage. Wilson’s 
sermon shook up Revell’s entire being. Making the link between Coloureds and 
the Khoisan cleared up any lasting confusion about her identity. It also helped

‘spirituality’ to frame certain practices and experiences in non-​European contexts. In most 
cases, speaking of ‘religion’ might be a Eurocentric translation of something else entirely. 
At the same time, contrasting African ‘spirituality’, ‘rituals’, or ‘beliefs’ with ‘religion’ (as 
Europeans practice it), might imply an unintended moral hierarchy between them. While it 
is vital to keep this in mind when using certain words at the expense of others, in line with 
my overall approach, I stick to emic interpretations of these concepts as much as I can.

her make sense of troubling experiences in her life, such as the abovemen­
tioned school visit to the Castle. Revell began to look for traces of Khoisan 
ancestry in her own family, but her siblings and parents initially refused to, or 
could not, give her the answers she was looking for. Many till this day distance 
themselves from her because of her public profile as a Khoisan revivalist. Some 
family members, on the other hand, have slowly opened up to Khoisan iden­
tity precisely because of her commitments. With their assistance, Revell has 
since pieced together that her mother’s family has Nama roots and that there 
are connections to the Griqua on her father’s side. She also began to attend 
Khoisan-​related events she came across and sought to learn as much as pos­
sible about them. In this process, she got in touch with a couple of Khoisan 
revivalists who ran a donations-​based satellite office and ‘information centre’ 
in Elsies River that was linked to King Joseph Katz and his Katz Korana Royal 
House, based in the Northern Cape. Many Khoisan collectives wanted to recruit 
Revell at the time, but she decided to associate herself with Katz because she 
‘liked the way he explained history’. Katz in turn inspired Revell to volunteer 
weekly community history seminars at the satellite office, where we had our 
first interview in 2014. Although these were discontinued soon after we met, a 
handful of participants had usually shown up with all sorts of questions about 
(family) history and identity. Many reportedly left with a newfound apprecia­
tion of their Khoisan roots. The seminars were advertised in enn as follows:
We want to bring back cultural knowledge to the community. We feel that 
it is a dire need and vital for the ‘so-​called coloured people’ to know who 
they are and what their roots are. We are dedicated to help restore our 
identity and do away with the ‘coloured’ identity by virtue of self-​deter­
mination through education of historical background on ground level.

Engaging in these types of activities and networking among likeminded 
individuals in Cape Town and beyond made Revell well-​known in Khoisan 
revivalist circles. It also gave her access to more information on the Khoisan 
and indigenous rights. With the help of her connections, Revell successfully 
applied for a bursary to attend the Short Course of Indigenous Rights at the 
University of Pretoria’s Centre for Human Rights in September 2011. This 
exposed her to the predicaments of indigenous people globally and the legal 
context in which they are dealt with. A certificate proudly hangs on her living 
room wall today. As I described in preceding chapters, Revell was elected as 
a Western Cape representative to the nkc in 2012 and she formally entered 
the Katz Korana Royal House as a princess in 2017 (more on these kinds of

appellations in Chapter 5). In the span of a decade, Revell thus went from 
being largely clueless about the Khoisan to becoming one of the most promi­
nent Khoisan revivalists in the country and a leading figure in Khoisan politics. 
But Revell’s Khoisan revivalism is not just related to politics, it also informs 
her everyday life. For Revell, who is a strong believer and avid churchgoer, this 
especially means articulating a sense of Khoisan spirituality. Concomitantly, 
one of the reasons why Revell, and indeed many other Khoisan revivalists, 
understand their embrace of Khoisan identity as a profound spiritual experi­
ence undoubtedly has to do with the prominent role of religion in their lives. 
Both of these features are evident in Revell’s engagements with her church as 
a Khoisan revivalist.
As I explained in the Introduction, not long after I met Revell she began to 
work as a secretary and office manager with the charismatic evangelical New 
Hope Church based in Retreat, founded in 2001.3 Before she joined New Hope, 
there had not been any talk about the Khoisan. According to Revell, aside from 
the various stigmas attached to Khoisan identity, churches are reluctant to 
associate with the Khoisan because they fear it is tantamount to embracing 
some sort of heathen culture. Many Khoisan revivalists, however, have argued 
that Khoisan spirituality is not opposed to Christianity –​ echoing similar argu­
ments made by the early missionaries among the Khoisan (Landau 1999). Willa 
Boezak, who holds a PhD in theology from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 
has for instance devoted much of his work to highlighting the similarities 
between Khoisan spirituality and the Christian faith (see e.g. Boezak 2017a). To 
make his arguments more digestible to a lay audience, he published Struggle of 
an Ancient Faith. The Khoi-​San of South Africa in 2017. The book starts off with 
a critique of colonialism’s dismissive and destructive attitude towards Khoisan 
spirituality but then makes a theological case for appreciating Khoisan spir­
ituality as a form of proto-​Christianity. According to Boezak (2017b, 139), the 
Khoisan kept practicing their ‘ancient faith’ all along, just under a different 
name: ‘[T]‌he Khoi-​San faith is like the solid foundation of a house, and our cul­
ture the bricks, walls, windows, doors and roof’. Boezak (ibid., 323) argues that 
there are countless similarities, ranging from the figure of Heitsi-​Eibib, who, 
like Jesus Christ is said to have risen from the dead, to the ancient !Nau rit­
ual, which he interprets as a kind of communion and baptism (see Chapter 6). 
Boezak (2017b, 327) concludes that the Khoisan therefore ‘gladly accepted 
the Christian faith, because [they] discovered that much of it was just like 
[theirs]. And that’s the bottom-​line’. The bottom-​line indeed is that, according

to Boezak and others who share his line of thinking, embracing Khoisan roots 
only deepens their Christianity (see also Ives 2017, 44).
A similar argument is put forward by those claiming that one has to 
embrace their ‘true identity’ in order to live an upright and God-​fearing life, 
which echoes the premises of the identity crisis thesis. Bradley van Reenen, 
who preaches at New Hope but only began to reflect on Khoisan identity after 
meeting Revell, explained to me that Coloureds needed to embrace Khoisan 
identity and culture from a spiritual point of view in order to put an end to 
cycles of oppression:
Our soul is not connected to the place where we come from […] We have 
generations that take on values birthed in the context of oppression […] 
They will not understand the heritage and the value of it […] Our true 
identity and heritage is that we were a resourceful and powerful people 
[…] As a church we redirect our people to the beginning, uncover the 
value system, the identity.
bradley van reenen, 11/​05/​2018
The Foundation Nation Restoration (fnr), an organization set up in 2010 
by Hilary-​Jane Solomons, similarly mobilizes ‘Biblical research truths […] 
the Biblical principle of the “First” in relation to the First Nation Restoration 
People and its comparisons with Israel as God’s first national people’ to draw 
a distinction between an ‘ordained identity’ (i.e. identity as ‘First Nations’ 
as endowed by God) and an ‘inherited identity’ (i.e. imposed labels that run 
counter to ‘the plan of the Most High’) (enn 2014c, 13; 2017a, 12; 2017b, 12). For 
fnr, ‘revival’ is about restoring the ordained identity, ‘being alive again to the 
purposes of the Most High El’ (enn 2015, 7). Khoisan revivalism is not just the 
road towards individual salvation; it will also ‘biblically restore’ the original 
balance among nations in South Africa and bestow ‘blessings’ upon all of its 
occupants. Not unlike arguments made by other Khoisan revivalists (see e.g. 
enn 2014j, 6), fnr argues that, as the Foundation Nation, God intended the 
Khoisan to be the ‘stewards’ of the land (‘i.e. to tend, guard and nurture the 
land and its resources’) and conflicts arise because the Khoisan are not cur­
rently fulflilling this role (enn 2015, 6). As Solomons put it during one of our 
interviews:
There are so many ailments in the land […] there is no acknowledgment, 
it is not about worshipping us, but about recognition […] We are doing 
this for the generations to come to ensure justice […] If the foundation 
nation gets recognized, benefits will flow through all the land […] The

Cape Flats is fruits of a bad root […] If you do not respect the foundation, 
everything build on it will not function accurately.
hillary solomons, 10/​10/​2017
I come back to the topic of land in the next chapter. The point here is rather to 
make initial forays into the links between Khoisan revivalism and the religios­
ity and Christianity that is practiced in Coloured communities. As churchgoers 
engage in Khoisan revivalism, their religious experiences are affected, particu­
larly if they insist that the two cannot be separated. It is indeed by making the 
types of arguments I just went through that Revell managed to make her col­
leagues at New Hope more receptive towards Khoisan revivalism. As I showed 
in the Introduction when I briefly mentioned the Resurrection Day event held 
at the Castle of Good Hope on Easter Sunday 2018, New Hope seems to have 
taken Khoisan revivalism on board wholeheartedly. The location was chosen 
in order to ‘spiritually take possession of the gates trauma […] to go back to the 
original sin [and] restore the prophetic destiny of the so-​called coloured peo­
ple’ (Desray van Rensburg, 08/​05/​2018). In their own account of what trans­
pired in the next edition of enn, Pastors José and Desray van Rensburg draw 
extensively on Khoisan revivalist themes and the identity crisis thesis:
Our program –​ An Arising of a Nation’s redemptive purpose –​ was based 
on our belief that God is busy calling up the first nation peoples of South 
Africa to take up their rightful place in this country and contribute pro­
foundly to the healing and restoration of our nation at this time. We 
believe that there are generational curses which are plaguing our first 
nation communities and those curses need to be broken [by] an act of 
redemption and a cleansing of the curses which have lingered for cen­
turies, especially those emanating from the Castle and its torture cham­
bers […] Apostle Roman confessed to not taking the Khoisan struggle 
seriously and in so doing contributing to the plight of the Khoisan peo­
ple. Furthermore, Apostle Roman expressed his deep regret at how dis­
missive he, and indeed the church, has been regarding the plight of the 
first nation people of our country. For that the Apostle asked the leaders 
present to please forgive him […] He then proudly declared his Khoisan 
identity and called on others to do likewise.

I was present at the event and followed the proceedings from one of the bal­
conies of the Castle, giving me somewhat of a bird’s-​eye view of the audience 
that occupied the main courtyard in the complex. The crowd, which included

Chapter 4
clergy from across the city and counted several hundred strong, were indeed 
repeatedly asked to embrace Khoisan identity to ‘get closer to God’ and ensure 
that ‘the inheritance of the Khoisan could no longer be ignored’. These pleas 
were met with resounding cheers, prayers, and applause. When I spoke to the 
church leadership afterwards, they felt the event had been a tremendous suc­
cess. In fact, they had plans to inform other churches in Cape Town of their 
brand of Khoisan revivalist Christianity, set up a ‘Khoisan village’ as a tourist 
attraction and ‘do something with history and archives because people do not 
know their heritage’ (Jose van Rensburg, 09/​10/​2017; Desray van Rensburg, 08/​
05/​2018).
In sum: Khoisan revivalists articulate their Christianity/​spirituality in ways 
that strengthen other tenets of Khoisan revivalism, such as having a special 
relationship to the land and the importance of being recognized as indigenous 
people. These articulations not only allow Khoisan revivalists to thicken their 
Khoisan revivalism but also potentially recruit fellow believers into Khoisan 
revivalism. As the work of Boezak showed, there is not necessarily a contra­
diction between celebrating Christianity and criticizing the historical com­
plicity of the church in colonialism (see below). There is undoubtedly a great 
deal more to say about the links between Khoisan revivalism and religion as 
practiced in Coloured communities in Cape Town, but I do not have the data 
or qualifications to make further meaningful observations in this regard.4 
I addressed these links to note that they are meaningful but also to provide 
an example of how aspects from everyday life feature in the Khoisan identity 
discourse. Moreover, as I pointed out, the language of spirituality and religion 
chimes well with the identity crisis thesis. These types of sentiments regard­
ing a newly embraced Khoisan identity, it is important to note, are not always 
articulated in direct reference to institutionalized religions.

while to explore the theological aspects of Pentecostalism, Evangelicalism, and Apostolic 
Faith in relation to Khoisan revivalism, particularly the identity crisis argument (e.g. dis­
courses on ‘revival’, conversion, proselytization, being reborn and turning your back on pre­
vious sins, newfound love for Christ, and so forth). Another approach would be to scout for 
links to traditional Khoisan beliefs among Khoisan revivalists.

means putting an end to colonial/​post-​colonial pressures to assimilate, on 
the one hand, and experiencing a renewed sense of dignity and belonging as 
fully-​fledged human beings, on the other (see e.g. Langeveldt 2001, 71–​81; enn 
2014a, 5; 2017b, 4). These types of sentiments resonate throughout the follow­
ing excerpt from the poem Let me be by Colin Guido Papier, published in enn:
You ask of me to be what I’m not. Allow me to find myself, to find my 
soul. Do not push me to assimilate, to become what I’m not. Grant me the 
freedom to discover my inner-​most self. I am hurt and confused because 
I want to belong. But yet, I belong nowhere. For centuries now I carried 
this pain and turmoil within my spirit […] In my mind’s eye I can see my 
ancestors walk this land, feel and experience through their spirit […] I 
look up and see the half moon, beckoning the stars to show me the way 
home. In tune with my heartbeat my feet brought me home, home to 
myself. I’ve found myself, I am Khoi I am me.
enn 2013c, 12
Kirk Krotz, a hip hop artist based in Mitchells Plain, similarly recounted in enn 
how becoming aware of his Khoisan roots was an eye-​opening experience:
Like many others I grew up in a kind of dysfunctional family. I searched 
for my identity. It felt as if there was a conspiracy to keep silent about 
who I was, what my identity was. Then I met someone who told me about 
my Khoisan roots. It was a spiritual experience, it was hectic. He told me 
about things I had struggled with even unconsciously. He told me about 
my ancestry and my forebears. It struck a chord. Today I look around and 
I wonder where are my Khoisan people? […] Where are the street names 
called after them? Where is our visibility?

identity as eye-​opening experiences, casting a radically different light on both

the past and the present. These perspectives were off limits as long as they 
knew themselves as Coloured. In her autobiography The Keeper of the Kumm 
(2016), Sylvia Vollenhoven describes how discovering her Khoisan identity and 
engaging with Khoisan history was the only cure for her debilitating condition 
(see also Veracini and Verbuyst 2020). Reflecting on her life through this lens 
and reconnecting with her ‘ancestors’ allowed her to confront ‘a prison’ she did 
not know existed, and remedy ‘an illness’ she could not diagnose: ‘[Coloured] is 
a word that has become heavy and diseased’ (Vollenhoven 2016, 4, 142). Others 
have similarly described being labelled Coloured as being born in a prison and 
having to live a life of lies (see e.g. enn 2014c, 6). As Ruben Richards, a business 
man, community leader and sometime academic, put it in a column for enn 
after wondering why so many Khoisan descendants seem to ‘hate themselves’ 
and engage in self-​destructive behaviour:
For 400 years we have been described in negative terms –​ sub-​human, 
beasts, not capable of intellectual reasoning and a plethora of other neg­
ative descriptions […] If you believe that you are less than, then you will 
be less than […] May I suggest that we start acting like we are valuable 
to this society –​ not in an arrogant way –​ but with the quiet confidence 
that comes from a person and a people who are okay with themselves –​ a 
healed person –​ a whole nation […] Unfortunately, the scars of our past 
run deep and the wounds are still tender –​ even after 400 years. So let’s be 
gentle with each other as we help each other heal.
enn 2014j, 3
Richards’ reference to wounds and scars to describe the ongoing harm of 
certain historical legacies is common among Khoisan revivalists, and indeed 
among marginalized groups globally (see Chapter 7). To provide a safe space 
to relay such experiences, enn regularly features ‘healing stories’ where pain­
ful experiences related to Coloured identity are shared (see e.g. enn 2016a, 6; 
2017a, 8). Lucelle Campbell often writes in enn about the need to acknowl­
edge and break the cycle of ‘intergenerational trauma’, which in her appraisal 
generates ‘multiple deficiencies and dependencies’ and stems from ‘gener­
ations of painful servitude and a collective loss of memory of self, kinship, 
language, culture, land, labour, and much more’ (enn 2017c, 12). Tellingly, in 
their recent report on the Khoisan, the sahrc also acknowledged the poten­
tial effects of trauma by ascertaining that various social ills might be ‘a direct 
result of the culmination of a history of discrimination, forced assimilation, 
dispossession and the denial of recognition as a distinct group, resulting in a 
lack of confidence, self-​trust and ultimately, a loss of identity’ (sahrc 2018,

71). Many Khoisan revivalists have called for the establishment of a new Truth 
and Reconciliation Commission that specifically deals with trauma related to 
the pre-​apartheid period, which was previously left out (see e.g. enn 2016b, 2; 
Richards 2017, 206).
The language of trauma and healing is particularly pronounced in discus­
sions about organized crime, which has plagued the Cape Flats since the 1980s 
(cf. Jensen 1999; 2006). While organized crime affects various parts of Cape 
Town, the incarceration rate is the highest among Coloureds, as are drug-​
related crimes (Johnson 2017, 16). Operating in the sex industry, drugs, alcohol, 
contraband, and poaching, gangs particularly recruit among the poor, unem­
ployed, and those born into dysfunctional families (Lambrechts 2012, 787–​193). 
People such as Don Pinnock have argued that part of the appeal of gangs, who 
have their own markers of belonging, stems from the swathe of negative ste­
reotypes that are associated with Coloured identity (Pinnock 2016, 9; see also 
Petrus 2013, 77). Khoisan revivalists give a similar interpretation. One enn con­
tributor for instance noted that the only way ‘disturbing evils such as gangster­
ism and drugs and an overwhelming sense of hopelessness’ can be overcome 
is if ‘the root of the problem’ is dealt with, ‘which is to restore our people’s 
humanity through the full and proper recognition as the descendants of the 
very first people who live in this land’ (enn 2014i, 12). Another piece in enn 
(2014i, 8) likewise concluded that ‘claiming back identity’ was the only bul­
wark against the ‘degradation, denial of our humanity’ that spawns commu­
nity violence and overall acts of desperation.
Though the success of this approach is hard to gauge, the idea of fighting 
crime with Khoisan revivalism has been around for decades; generating con­
crete examples of how Khoisan identity is believed to be an antidote to social 
ills. As I noted in Chapter 3, Basil Coetzee became involved in Khoisan reviv­
alism in the aftermath of Joseph Little’s speech at Pollsmoor prison in 1998. 
Having worked with inmates for over a decade, Basil Coetzee and some of his 
colleagues subsequently began to proselytize Khoisan revivalism among them, 
an approach that caught the attention of various other correctional facilities 
in the country (Coetzee 2019b, 123–​124).6 He was stunned by how effective this 
approach was in getting prisoners motivated and potentially turn their lives 
around (Basil Coetzee, 06/​05/​2018). Coetzee understood that the inmates had

Domination of African Minorities (madam). Created in 2004 by some of his colleagues at 
correctional services, madam promoted Khoisan identity with the aim of earmarking jobs 
for Coloureds and putting a stop to the hiring of allegedly underqualified Black staff (Besten 
2009, 149).

given up hope for a better life and he made it clear to them that they were first 
and foremost ‘incarcerated in the mind’ and were looking for a ‘replacement 
identity’ as criminals (Basil Coetzee, 25/​04/​2018). As he explains in Tears of the 
Praying Mantis:
To our amazement the prisoners started to respond to what we were doing 
and wanted to know more about their own roots. We tried our best to pro­
vide what they were strongly longing for as it was essential that they disen­
gage themselves from the deceptive and duping prison culture that were 
so detrimental to them […] The Khoi identity proved exactly what was 
needed in order for them to lead a life free from artificial existence […] I 
think we reignited the essence of self-​knowledge to more people than we 
could have imagined.
coetzee 2019b, 125
Coetzee is not the only one reaching for Khoisan identity to both combat and 
historically frame organized crime in Cape Town. enn for instance regularly 
publishes opinion pieces from authors claiming that Coloureds commit crimes 
because they ‘do not know where they are coming from’ (see e.g. enn 2013a, 
12). Sometimes the reference to Khoisan history is more direct. Chantal Revell, 
who blamed soaring levels of crime on the fact that the Khoisan, ‘natural war­
riors’ with a ‘strong inherent territorial nature’ who ‘seem to lose their tempers 
in a matter of seconds for no apparent reason’, are made to live in ‘flats with no 
space to breathe’:
There was a governmental structure who ruled the way of life for the 
indigenous peoples. When colonialism came it was destroyed. Indigenous 
groups knew how to interact with each other’s boundaries. There were 
treaties made when they needed to use each other’s resources like water 
or grazing lands. When colonialists took the land they took their systems 
away and replaced it with an oppressive one. This is still evident today.
enn 2015, 6
According to some, sheer exposure to indigeneity suffices to get people to turn 
their backs on a life of crime and transition back into society. enn (2016a, 
13) featured an interesting testimonial in this regard by the ngo South Roots 
International, established in South Africa in 1997 as an offshoot of Island 
Breeze International, a religiously inspired ngo based in Polynesia to uplift

indigenous communities through ‘cultural expression dances and songs’.7 The 
episode in question dates from 2004, when South Roots invited a delegation of 
Maori from Aotearoa/​New Zealand to perform a play entitled Broken Shackles 
at a location where rivalling gangs had recently fought one another (enn 2014j, 
7). When the delegation performed the Haka and explained to the bystanders 
that they ought to be proud of their indigenous identity, many gang members 
reportedly ‘left their weapons and contraband’ and asked for forgiveness. Most, 
however, bank on a long-​term investment. A case in point is the aforemen­
tioned Ruben Richards’ ngo, the Ruben Richards Foundation. The Foundation 
organizes ‘community conversations’, aimed at crafting ‘solutions for broken 
communities which are trapped in cycles of despair and crisis [by] exploring 
the pain and trauma experienced by the indigenous Khoisan over many centu­
ries of colonial and post-​colonial rule in South Africa’ (enn 2017b, 6). The focus 
is on ‘facilitating healing linked to identity in general and indigenous iden­
tity and heritage in particular’ by, among other things, educating participants 
about Khoisan history and identity and boosting their ‘sense of self-​worth’ 
(rrf 2017, 6, 8). The rationale behind these exchanges, which not only involve 
(ex-​)gang members, is to create ‘a safe space where when you tell your story, 
you get the audience to say yes, I feel that, I can empathize with that’ (enn 
2017b, 6). The workbook designed to guide the conversations suggests several 
exercises, such as provoking a reflection on the relationship between political 
and cultural identity, and organizing quizzes about Khoisan history (rrf 2017, 
10, 14, 30). Hinting at a Khoisan revivalist interpretation, participants are asked 
how they would sum up South Africa’s history (see below):
Will you start your narrative with your mother and father? Will you 
start […] with Jan van Riebeeck who allegedly arrived in an empty land 
in 1652? Or will you start with the story about the original inhabitants 
(possibly your ancestors), namely the [Khoisan] who for millennia lived 
harmoniously with nature –​ in a green (or blue) economy –​ all over 
South Africa long before anyone else arrived; certainly long before the 
Europeans made the first recorded contact with the South African indig­
enous people at the end of the 15th century and long before the Bantu 
peoples migrated into South Africa from central and east Africa almost 
2000 years ago.

Chapter 4
enn featured a series of testimonials from people who took part in ‘commu­
nity conversations’ in 2017 (enn 2017b, 6–​7). Lucelle Campbell relayed how she 
felt ‘goose bumps’ while overlooking Table Bay during the break and reflecting 
on the ‘process of dispossession of the indigenous people […] the arrival of 
various ships of colonial empires’. Another participant, ‘Chief Ernest Solomon’, 
similarly realized how ‘Alles het hier by die see begin. Dit is die plek waar ons 
mense verneder is [the sea is where everything began, the place where our 
people were humiliated]’. He went to argue that this humiliation will persist 
until people come to realize they are ‘die slagoffers van die misdade van Jan 
van Riebeeck [the victims of the crimes of Jan van Riebeeck]’. Solomon was a 
highly controversial figure in Khoisan revivalist circles because of his involve­
ment in organized crime under the nickname Ernie ‘Lastig’. Solomon however 
maintained he had put all of that behind him and that his embrace of Khoisan 
identity proved pivotal in this regard (enn 2015, 4). He was subsequently 
ordained as a chief of the Gorinhaiqua by undergoing a !Nau organized by 
Zenzile Khoisan in 2011. Zenzile (29/​06/​2018) saw Solomon first and foremost 
as a leader and it was precisely his troubled past that made it so significant that 
he became invested in Khoisan revivalism. Other Khoisan revivalists shared 
this view. One of my interlocutors for instance believed gangsters were ‘leaders 
in our communities by natural selection […] they are like chiefs, guarding their 
territories’ (Nolan Berry, 18/​12/​2018). They did not want a life of crime at heart 
and therefore needed to be ‘conscientized as Khoisan’ and made to realize they 
are perpetuating a ‘system of oppression’.
Solomon professed he wanted to be ‘part of the solution’ by acting as a 
‘national arbiter of peace’ between conflicting gangs and inducting them 
through a process of ‘indigenous conscientization’ (enn, 2014e, 2; 2015, 4).8 
In an interview I conducted with Solomon, he repeatedly emphasized how 
he had grown up ‘on that side of the street’ and had been at the frontlines of 
‘the struggle’ all his life, making him the ideal candidate for the job (Ernest 
Solomon, 29/​06/​2018). Solomon located the root of community violence and 
the lack of respect for human life with the perpetrators’ refusal to accept indig­
enous identity (enn 2015, 5; 2016b, 1–​2: 2017b, 2). The identity crisis can only 
be resolved, he argued, through the ‘foundational principle of indigenous 
healing’, which he defined as understanding your identity, being proud of your 
roots and acting responsibly towards your community. Until he was murdered 
in a gang-​related assassination in November 2020 (Cruywagen 2020), Solomon

between gangs in 2014 (enn 2014c, 10).

was actively spreading his message. He not only spoke at schools and prisons 
but also appeared in a feature film with strong Khoisan revivalist undertones 
and political messaging, The Lost Tribe, directed by Mark Fyfe and released 
in 2016 (see also enn 2017a, 5). By focusing on Solomon’s life and activities 
as a Khoisan revivalist, The Lost Tribe endorsed the identity crisis thesis, con­
cluding that if indigenous status is not granted to the Khoisan, ‘the intergen­
erational infection of the disease that is killing off the earliest inhabitants of 
South Africa will spread unchecked with devastating consequences’.
I could give countless other examples to illustrate how a self-​diagnosed 
identity crisis is foundational to the Khoisan identity discourse. Indeed, the 
case of Solomon illustrates the recurrent emphasis on the need to relate to the 
Khoisan past in order to frame and deal with grievances in the present, as well 
as the catharsis that is associated with embracing Khoisan identity. But the 
historical references I have mentioned thus far are mostly broad-​brush. In the 
remainder of this chapter, I shift the emphasis away from identity as such, and 
focus more on concrete Khoisan revivalist interpretations of history.
4.2	
Reclaiming Khoisan History: Coloured Indigeneity and Indigenous 
Colouredness
As I argued in the Introduction, the notion of indigenous revivalism prompts 
the question: which aspects of the past are engaged with and why? The motives 
are not unidimensional and therefore scrutinized across this book. However, 
this subchapter takes this line of enquiry on board in particular by examining 
various explicit emic perspectives on the Khoisan past. Just as Khoisan reviv­
alists can differ greatly in the way they relate to (their) Khoisan identity, per­
spectives on the past are not uniform either. And yet, as with identity, there are 
commonalities in the ways Khoisan revivalists tend to think, speak and write 
about the past. In line with my overall approach, my aim is to both showcase 
this diversity and to distil common themes. I begin by delineating the premise 
of Khoisan revivalist engagements with the past: the idea that Khoisan history 
has been distorted and urgently needs to be countered with the perspectives 
of Khoisan revivalists. These interpretations are primarily concerned with con­
tinuities between past and present, particularly in relation to experiences of 
marginalization in the post-​apartheid era and Coloured identity. In the follow­
ing section I examine some concrete initiatives, mostly history books authored 
by Khoisan revivalists. In the final section, I look at how Khoisan revivalists’ 
articulations of indigeneity relate to specific values and figures from the past. 
Due to her prominence in this regard, I focus on the historical figure Krotoa.

4.2.1	
Khoisan Revivalist Perspectives on the Past: Exposing Historical 
Continuity
Looking back on my fieldwork, almost as common as the rejection of Coloured 
identity was the belief that Khoisan history has been, and continues to be, 
erased, untold, and distorted. As I make apparent in this book, a great deal 
is often referenced all at once with the terms ‘history’, ‘the past’, or geskiede­
nis, ranging from history textbooks and academic works, to representations 
in the media and general knowledge about the Khoisan. Specific authors or 
episodes from the past are sometimes referenced, but on most occasions the 
status quo of representations of the Khoisan past is assessed in the form of 
blanket statements, related to feelings of contemporary discrimination and 
exclusion from institutionalized circuits of knowledge production. In line 
with the identity crisis argument, it is common to hear opinions like Chantal 
Revell’s (07/​03/​2018), who lamented that Coloureds ‘do not know their history 
[…] They do not know what they owned, what they had, what is theirs. They 
are like bastard children, they have no inheritance’. The Khoisan, it is indeed 
often claimed, have been ‘written out of history’ (see e.g. Langeveldt 2001, 71). 
There is a sense that the ‘truth’ about the Khoisan past remains unexplored 
or deliberately hidden from the public, particularly when it comes to violent 
atrocities and acts of dispossession –​ another reason why some have called 
for a Khoisan-​themed Truth and Reconciliation Commission (enn 2014c, 4). 
As a result, the existing ‘history’ is frequently dismissed for perpetuating the 
Khoisan extinction discourse and impeding political mobilization around rep­
arations (Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras, 03/​01/​2015). For Basil Coetzee (2019b, 37), 
most existing historical texts and monuments have ‘elevated white murderers 
to heroes […] while the Khoikhoi and San were made out to be scoundrels and 
savages’. His assessment is echoed by countless others, with calls such as ‘ons 
moet ons geskiedenis herskryf [we have to rewrite our history]’ (en 2012d, 9) or 
‘we have the responsibility to change the narrative’ (enn 2017b, 7) made on a 
regular basis. To a large extent, Khoisan revivalism is therefore about identify­
ing forgotten, suppressed, or distorted histories, on the one hand, and going 
against the grain, reimagining what was lost, and spreading Khoisan revivalist 
histories, on the other.
To be sure, this drive is discernable in all of the Khoisan revivalists’ engage­
ments with the past, not just those expressed discursively. Having said that, 
discourse constitutes a vital component because, as I argued in Chapter 2, 
Khoisan revivalism is rooted in the Khoisan revisionist historiography of the 
1970s and 1980s. Indeed, the Khoisan revivalist historical initiatives I discuss 
in more detail in the next section can be seen as extending this line of critical 
enquiry. However, for reasons I get into at length in Chapter 7, the two cannot

be equated either. What is important to note for present purposes is that atti­
tudes towards history as an intellectual practice can differ greatly. As I showed 
with the cchdc in Chapter 3, academic texts are often simultaneously crit­
icized in the abovementioned manner and utilized to dig up facts about 
Khoisan history. In my estimation, claims that academic materials are unjustly 
off limits by being behind pay walls or authored by non-​Khoisan trump calls 
for their outright rejection. I regularly spotted well-​known academic texts at 
the homes of my interlocutors, such as the work of historian Nigel Penn (2005). 
On the social media app WhatsApp, digitalized books, articles, and PhD theses 
related to the Khoisan also regularly circulate alongside historical maps and 
illustrations. This suggests a widespread, if critical and divergent, engagement 
with academic materials for purposes of Khoisan revivalism. According to 
many Khoisan revivalists, particularly university graduates, academic output 
is often mobilized uncritically. While providing much of the initial impetus for 
Khoisan revivalism, Henry Bredekamp (10/​07/​2018) eventually distanced him­
self from it because its engagements with the past went against his training 
as an academic historian, particularly in the domain of traditional leadership 
claims: ‘people do not read the footnotes’ and are not interested in a ‘balanced 
perspective’, but in ‘mythologizing’. On a similar note, Johann Abrahams (10/​
07/​2019), who shot a documentary on the Khoisan (see below), feels that most 
Khoisan revivalists ‘do not go enough into the records to get the true informa­
tion, even if they have to approach it critically, of course’. Other interlocutors 
too decry that many practice ‘cut and paste history’ (Calvyn Gilfellan, 29/​09/​
2017).
Tellingly, these criticisms mostly concern claims for land or traditional 
leadership positions, which is but one of the ways in which Khoisan revival­
ists engage with the past (see Chapter 5). Multiple factors are driving them to 
relate to and reclaim Khoisan history. What they have in common, regardless 
of opinions about academic historiography, is laying bare historical continu­
ities between past and present. Coming back to my opening remarks, the con­
tinuity that is emphasized is primarily between the early encounters between 
the Khoisan and the settlers, on the one hand, and experiences of being known 
as Coloured during apartheid and thereafter, on the other. Given the origins 
of Khoisan revivalism in the anti-​apartheid struggle and the widespread dis­
appointment with the post-​apartheid dispensation, this is not surprising. This 
frustration is compounded by the belief that Coloureds were in fact more 
instrumental to bringing the apartheid regime to its knees than the anc (cf. 
Simone 1994, 168). Khoisan revivalists often reference the fact that Coloureds 
made the streets of Cape Town ‘ungovernable’ in the 1980s while the anc lead­
ership was imprisoned or exiled (Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras, 03/​01/​2015). Many

who (had parents who) participated in the udf, or in the anti-​apartheid strug­
gle in general, pointed to the lack of progress in Khoisan politics as proof that 
they were ‘excluded’ or ‘sold out’ by the anc in the post-​apartheid era, who, 
they allege, has relinquished its non-​racialist position for an agenda that is 
primarily aimed at uplifting Blacks –​ a point I return to in the next chapter 
(see e.g. Mackie, 08/​01/​2015; William Langeveldt, 12/​03/​2018; Tanyan Gradwell, 
31/​07/​2019). Disgruntled activists who had shelved issues of Coloured identity 
during the struggle years –​ some of whom are notable udf members such as 
Joe Marks –​ thus turned to Khoisan revivalism in the post-​apartheid era to 
make sense of the plight of Coloureds.9
A key architect in setting up a platform to vent these frustrations is Zenzile 
Khoisan. As I noted in Chapter 3, Zenzile was actively involved in the anti-​
apartheid struggle and came to Khoisan identity and his revolutionary brand 
of Khoisan revivalism as a result of experiencing stigmas surrounding Coloured 
identity and his disappointment with the anc’s neglect of Khoisan issues post-​
1994: ‘everything was put on suspension [during apartheid] because we had 
a common enemy to fight, but the Khoisan question has been written out of 
the transition’ (Zenzile Khoisan, 17/​05/​2018). ‘Starting history in the middle’ 
in this manner fails to appreciate how the Khoisan past serves as a proxy to 
frame experiences related to Coloured identity (Zenzile Khoisan, 12/​06/​2018). 
For Zenzile, and indeed many other Khoisan revivalists, the origins of anti-​
colonialism do not lie with the anc, but with the Khoisan and their resistance 
to the European settlers in the early 16th century: ‘[O]‌ns is nie weeskinders in 
die land waar ons voorouers ‘n groot bloedspoor getrap het om hierdie land te 
verdedig en te bewaar nie. Dit is ons mense wat gemartel, beroof en byna uitgewis 
is sodat ander die vrugte kan geniet, sodat ander die voordeel kan trek en sodat 
ander wet kan slaan [We are not orphans in this country, which our forebears 
shed their blood to defend and keep, where our people were tortured, mugged, 
and almost erased so that others could enjoy its fruits, so that others could reap 
the benefits and become in charge]’ (enn 2015, 2). As one user on social media 
put it in a post in 2018, ‘long before’ the celebrated Black anti-​apartheid icons 
‘[Steve] Biko, [Chris] Hani and Winnie [Mandela], there was Autshumato, 
Doman and Krotoa’ –​ their 17th century Khoisan predecessors (see below). 
To highlight the timeworn credentials of their struggle, Mackie (08/​01/​2015) 
never uses the popular anc rallying cry ‘Amandla!’ but deliberately subverts

another popular anc slogan ‘the struggle continues!’, by using its translation 
into Khoekhoegowab instead, ‘toa tama !khams ge’.
The emphasis on the Khoisan as ‘the first freedom fighters in South Africa’ 
is indeed commonplace (enn, 2016b, 1–​2). It is common to refer to the defeat 
of the Portuguese general D’Almeida in 1510 in this regard, ‘the first war against 
colonialism’ and ‘the first struggle for freedom’ (enn 2014b, 2; see Chapter 2). 
Repelling D’Almeida and his troops epitomizes ‘’n tyd van oorwinning, volk­
strots, buitengewone dapperheid en patriotisme, meer as 500 jaar gelede [a time 
of victory, pride, outstanding bravery, and patriotism, more than 500 years 
ago]’ (enn 2014c, 6). Willa Boezak, urges Coloureds to ‘take lessons to heart 
and apply to the society of today, where the people are facing danger, and the 
social ills need to be tackled with the same spirit as the soldiers in 1510’ (ibid., 
6). In 2010, Zenzile suggested that not enough was being done to honour the 
significance of the battle during a commemoration of the events of 1510 at 
Iziko museums in Cape Town (De Wet and Burgess 2011, 485). As I show in 
the following chapter, this perception led certain Khoisan revivalists to stage 
a land claim at the location where the battle is believed to have taken place. 
In any case, there is agreement across the board that the defeat of D’Almeida 
is too significant to be ‘omitted […] from the official record’ or reduced to a 
‘footnote’ (enn 2014b, 8). The same reasoning extends to the first Khoikhoi-​
Dutch war in 1659, which one interlocutor describes as the fight against the 
‘first apartheid border’ in reference to Jan van Riebeeck’s almond hedge, which 
impeded the Khoisan’s cattle from entering his newly demarcated property 
(Langeveldt 2001, 71).
Speaking about Khoisan resistance campaigns through an anti-​apartheid 
register not only ties Khoisan revivalism to the earliest forms of Khoisan 
‘nationalism’ but also pushes back the ‘anti-​apartheid struggle’ hundreds of 
years. Indeed, the Khoisan past is not only engaged with to cultivate pride, 
historically frame contemporary social ills, and to resolve the identity crisis 
(as I show in more detail in the next section) but also works the other way 
around: the lives of Coloureds are embedded in an ancient indigenous strug­
gle against oppression and thereby given greater significance. Coloureds are 
pulled from the margins of history and placed firmly at the centre. Lucelle 
Campbell for instance believes it is ‘shameful’ that prominent Coloured activ­
ists are unrecognized considering that their backs carry ‘the marks of struggle 
and bondage long before apartheid’ (enn 2016a, 12). To rectify this, enn (2016a, 
11) celebrated notable figures in the anti-​apartheid struggle from the Coloured 
community in Cape Town such as Coline Williams, Robbie Waterwich, Ashley 
Kriel, and Anton Fransch as ‘[y]‌oung Khoi warriors that roared across the flats’ 
and ‘Khoi freedom fighters’. The article does not reference their relation to

Khoisan identity (or history), but rather sums up their lives under this ban­
ner to call forth volunteer Khoisan revivalists: ‘Are you willing to follow in the 
footsteps of the Heroes and Heroines of the Khoi and San People of South 
Africa? The Nation needs you to stand up and become a volunteer in the fight 
for recognition, restitution, restoration’ (enn 2016a, 7). As a reply to the article 
noted, Khoisan revivalism essentially recuperates and endorses the efforts of 
Coloureds, past and present, in this fashion (enn 2016a, 11).
This is clearly close to Zenzile’s heart. In March 2018, I attended a meeting 
he called in the town hall of Mowbray to collectively reflect on how to push 
Khoisan politics forward and address a host of other pressing issues, such as 
the drought that was afflicting South Africa at the time. Attendees stressed the 
need for unity and for the establishment of a Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs. 
However, as tends to happen in these kinds of meetings, the gathering ended 
up mostly functioning as a safe space and echo chamber, where likeminded 
views about the Khoisan past could not only be expressed without judgement 
but also reinforced and validated with praise. There was agreement across 
the board that prominent members in the Coloured community were over­
due for their moment in the spotlight, which they got to enjoy to some extent 
that evening by taking to the stage and being thanked for their commitment 
to the advancement of both Coloured communities and Khoisan revivalism. 
Disgruntled at their current lack of recognition in society, Khoisan revivalism 
seems to have given these people a second life as indigenous leaders, and their 
contributions similarly recast as part of an ancient struggle for freedom.
Those attending the Mowbray meeting also relayed a rather common view 
regarding the wider implications of relating Coloured history to indigenous 
history for South Africa’s philosophy on historical justice. According to Khoisan 
revivalists, any serious attempt at rectifying past injustices needs to reckon 
with ‘the proverbial thorn in the flesh of the new South Africa […] 400 years of 
cultural and social disintegration […] and the deliberate destruction of the first 
nation and its descendants’ (enn 2014j, 3). South Africa’s primordial sin needs 
to be acknowledged, and, for some, this extends beyond returning stolen land 
and encompasses ‘biological warfare, genocide, political exclusion, mass mur­
der and a host of other gross human rights violations’ (enn 2014a, 4). Taking 
the long view means appreciating how many of the debates that are ongoing 
in South Africa, such as the discussions about land or the decolonization of 
(tertiary) education, need to have an appropriate temporal reach in order to 
become meaningful for the Khoisan and deal with ‘’n baie groter probleem wat 
diep ingebed is in die fondasie van ons samenlewing […] die onteining van die 
inheemse volk die basis vorm van al die euwels wat hier plaatsgevind het; dat die 
super rykes in hierdie land hul rykdom gebou het op [a much bigger problem

that is embedded in the foundation of our society […] the dispossession of 
the indigenous people that became the root of all evil that took place here, 
upon which the rich built their wealth]’ (enn, 2016b, 1–​2). Indeed, for Zenzile 
(12/​06/​2018), these kinds of historical continuities uncover ‘the agency in our 
story’ and allow ‘the essence of history’ to be extrapolated. Khoisan revival­
ism, he concludes, is not about ‘returning to the past’, but ‘about unlocking the 
power that lies embedded in what has been disturbed in antiquity to be able 
to give us the mechanisms to deal with the complexities of the contemporary 
world’ (Zenzile Khoisan, 17/​05/​2018).
Zenzile is far from alone in embracing such a perspective. Indeed, this way 
of thinking resonates widely among Khoisan revivalists, who constantly draw 
parallels between past and present (or point out stark contrasts, for that mat­
ter, as I show below) in order to make sense of the world around them and 
articulate their indigeneity. Looking at everyday realities through this lens pro­
vokes reflections on historical continuities between the trials and tribulations 
of the Khoisan and personal experiences, family histories, and contemporary 
socioeconomic challenges. Underlining continuities is also a direct counter to 
the Khoisan extinction discourse. However, while this way of relating past to 
present is shared by Khoisan revivalists, they go about showcasing and select­
ing these continuities differently and they do so for different reasons. In the 
remainder of this chapter, I detail this variety at some length.
4.2.2	
Rewriting the Khoisan Past
The bulk of this section deals with written texts, but there are of course other 
ways representations of the Khoisan past are put forward. While my research 
has not focused on social media, over the years it has become evident to me as 
a casual observer that, whether through public posts or interactions in closed 
groups on Facebook or WhatsApp, the amount of Khoisan revivalist-​related 
discussions have skyrocketed. Particularly in closed groups, social media func­
tions as a safe space to express Khoisan identity, connect with likeminded 
individuals and share interpretations of Khoisan history. Moreover, as I noted, 
it also facilitates the exchange of (academic) materials about Khoisan his­
tory and identity. As the example of Chantal Revell’s weekly seminars shows, 
another way of spreading Khoisan revivalist histories is organizing participa­
tory gatherings or holding presentations. Willa Boezak for instance embarked 
on a series of public lectures in Cape Town in 2015 and 2016 entitled ‘Die nael­
string lesings [The umbilical cord lectures]’, where he put forward arguments 
from his aforementioned Struggle of an Ancient Faith. Aside from religion, 
the series covered Khoisan identity more broadly as well as the origins of the 
Khoisan and of the language Afrikaans (enn 2015, 15). As he explained in enn

Chapter 4
(2017a, 11) when advertising his talks, Boezak picked the title for two reasons. 
Firstly, to refer to an age-​old Khoisan tradition of burying the umbilical cord of 
a new-​born child close to the house, which Boezak maintains is still practiced 
today, and, secondly, to emphasize that Coloureds are inescapably bound to 
Khoisan culture and religion.
Khoisan-​themed documentaries by Khoisan revivalists or sympathizers to 
their cause have also emerged in recent years. As it pertains to Cape Town, two 
examples stand out. Filmmaker and activist Weaam Williams has shot three 
documentaries: A Khoi Story Part 1 –​ Reclaiming the Mother Tongue (2009), 
showcasing efforts to revive Khoekhoegowab (see Chapter 6); A Khoi Story 
2 –​ Returning the Remains (2011), focusing on indigenous knowledge; and A 
Khoi Story 3 –​ Stories from the Caves (2014), discussing rock art and intellectual 
knowledge. While these documentaries do not focus on the past per se, they do 
explore in some detail how Khoisan revivalists such as Cecil Le Fleur or Yvette 
Abrahams engage with the Khoisan past to find meaning in their lives, whether 
in the form of indigenous knowledge or issues of identity. In The Khoekhoe 
Saga, creative producer Rudolf Rieger and director Johann Abrahams, on the 
other hand, focus mostly on a chronological overview of Khoisan history and 
feature a host of established academics such as Henry Bredekamp or Nigel 
Penn.10 I noted earlier how Abrahams holds the view that most Khoisan reviv­
alists are not interested in (critical) historical accounts and lack a basic set of 
facts about the past. This drove him to become involved with The Khoekhoe 
Saga, which consists of 13 episodes of roughly 25 minutes and is shot across 
South Africa (Johann Abrahams, 10/​07/​2019). The documentary will be freely 
available in schools and universities: ‘I want to see us rewrite the history with 
the documentary […] the youngsters need to know their history’. Abrahams 
himself only began to seriously reflect on his ancestry while studying overseas 
at the University of Kansas and interacting with Native Americans. When he 
came back to South Africa after the end of apartheid, he had a newfound pride 
in his Khoisan roots. His partner in the shooting of the documentary, Rudolf 
Rieger, is a European immigrant who has been interested in the Khoisan for 
two decades, including the Khoisan revivalists in Cape Town, resulting in a 
vast archive of footage, pictures, and audio recordings (Rudolf Rieger, 21/​06/​
2018). At the official screening of part of The Khoekhoe Saga at the Castle of 
Good Hope in July 2019, Zenzile Khoisan praised it as a victory for Khoisan 
revivalists, stressing how it showed the past was not forgotten: ‘We come here

to celebrate what has not been broken […] This is not about sitting at a grave 
site and mourning’.
Roughly two years earlier, on 19 September 2017, Zenzile was at the Castle 
as well, making similar remarks during the well-​attended launch of Bastaards 
Or Humans: The Unspoken Heritage of Coloured People, a two-​volume historical 
overview of Coloured history by the aforementioned Ruben Richards, with an 
emphasis on the Khoisan.11 As I noted, Richards enjoys a certain standing in 
the Coloured community. It is unclear when he became involved with Khoisan 
revivalism, although he rose to the forefront after going through a !Nau in 
2014 and publishing Bastaards or Humans, which has enjoyed some success 
(enn 2014f, 1). Indeed, during the Resurrection Day event I mentioned earlier, 
Richards delivered a speech on the history of the Castle of Good Hope where 
he announced that the Western Cape Minister of Education had endorsed his 
book as ‘an alternative history of South Africa, which will be integrated into 
the curriculum of high school learners’. Richards donated copies of his book 
to every public school in the Western Cape, and his alma mater, Heathfield 
High School, has made it part of its curriculum.12 Khoisan revivalists too have 
welcomed his work as it in many ways endorses their interpretations of the 
past. Indeed, in his remarks at the book launch, Zenzile celebrated the book 
as ‘an instrument to shift the paradigm’ because it departed from a ‘dispas­
sionate distance, that coldness, that almost anti-​sceptic way of dealing with 
history’ (see also enn 2017a, 16). In his blurb, he praised Bastaards or Humans 
as a ‘a sentinel text that answers the nagging questions about origins, bravely 
gives form and definition to a people who have been relegated to the margins 
of South Africa’s history’ (Richards 2017, ii). Aaron Messelaar, who I return to 
below, concurred in his own commentary, lauding the book for providing both 
‘critical insights into the distortions of our history’ and ‘the necessary tools for 
reinterpreting this history to restore the dignity of a people with a rich and 
proud history’. Lucelle Campbell for her part saw in the book an expression of 
‘agency’, a determination on part of the Khoisan to tell their ‘own stories’.

When I refer to Bastaards or Humans in this text, I draw exclusively from the first volume. 
The second volume, which appeared in 2018, was announced in the first volume as ‘the 
extended footnotes, explanations and supporting evidence’ for the arguments made in 
Volume One (Richards 2017, xix, xxi). However, it seems to be more of a second edition, as 
it covers mostly the same content.

Chapter 4
As I suggested previously, these homespun ‘stories’ lay bare continuities 
between past and present, and Bastaards or Humans is a prime example of this. 
Written for a general audience and drawing on both historical materials as well 
as previous writings, Richards intersperses a largely chronological account of 
Khoisan history with autobiographical anecdotes to provide ‘a hermeneutical 
window into the broader historical and cultural narrative’ (Richards 2017, xix, 
xxi). Bastaards or Humans is his attempt to ‘answer three simple, profound and 
recurring questions which we all encounter: Who am I? Where do I come from? 
Where am I going?’ (ibid., xvii; original emphasis). Richards (ibid., xix, xxi) finds 
these questions to be (made out to be) particularly complicated for Coloureds, 
whose heritage is ‘a subject matter which in many circles remains unspoken –​ 
and in literary circles hidden, sometimes distorted, or at best camouflaged’; 
especially as it relates to Khoisan ancestry. He was especially confronted with 
this while attending the debate on Khoisan land issues in Kimberley Two in 
2014 as a ‘facilitator’ (see Chapter 3). Richards (2017, 12; original emphasis) was 
struck by the widespread sentiment among delegates that ‘their stories, their 
heroes, their contributions to this country and their acts of resistance against 
their dispossession and dehumanisation [were] not part of the mainstream 
discourse’. Citing Khoisan revivalism as an explicit source of inspiration for the 
book, he chose to focus on the Khoisan in the hope that others also ‘embark 
on a personal journey of self-​discovery, healing, restoration and optimal liv­
ing’ (ibid., xix, xxi, 10). Bastaards or Humans’ goal is therefore not so much to 
‘re-​write history’ as it is to make it ‘come alive’ and ‘use data from our ancient 
past to construct a narrative that is meaningful to our present’ (ibid., 552). 
According to Richards, this currently lacking alternative interpretation of his­
tory has the potential to resolve the damage of centuries of assimilation, ‘self-​
hatred’, and ‘national amnesia’ (ibid., 30). He is convinced of this in large part 
in light of his own transformative encounter with Khoisan revivalism:
My urban upbringing ha[s]‌ disabused me of any Khoisan consciousness 
[…] The distance I felt then, compared to the closeness I feel today, is 
staggering. So what has changed? The short answer is: me […] I needed to 
move beyond the pejorative view of the Khoi and San as museum spec­
imens and cultural artefacts to be studied, as opposed to being a funda­
mental core of my personal identity and more broadly the identity of our 
nation. Wow! What a full-​circle for me. What a shift in consciousness.
ibid., 523–​524
Bastaards or Humans prescribes a history that emphasizes the agency of the 
Khoisan and debunks the notion that Coloured identity is all about ‘shame and

disgrace’ and lacks a deeply rooted indigeneity (Richards 2017, 44). Richards 
seems especially intent on recasting the early encounters between Khoisan 
and settlers as cordial and welcoming, particularly on the part of the Khoisan, 
except for their defeat of the Portuguese general D’Almeida, which is cele­
brated repeatedly in the book as an iconic anti-​colonial battle (see Chapter 2). 
Drawing for instance on the 1647 shipwreck of the Dutch ship Haerlem, which 
caused crewmembers to spend half a year on the shores of Table Bay, Richards 
(ibid., 126–​127) stresses how those who were stranded or fell ill were nursed 
back to health by the Khoisan. Richards (ibid., 130–​131) infers from sailors’ 
favourable accounts of the Khoisan that the Cape had ‘a reputation for being 
a place of healing –​ in addition to being a place of abundance in meat and 
water –​ indeed a Garden of Eden’. Portraying the 16th and early 17th century 
Cape as a site of healing and hospitality, Richards feels values from this early 
culture could mend divisions in contemporary South Africa. In an interest­
ing passage, he paraphrases a response that was reportedly made by certain 
Khoisan leaders while negotiating with the Dutch in the second half of the 17th 
century. Notice how Khoisan culture is juxtaposed to that of the colonialists:
We, the people of the Cape, are not like these van Riebeeck people. We 
are not colonial conquerors […] We are a welcoming people. We have a 
different values framework and code of conduct by which we live, com­
pared to these Europeans who arrive uninvited and just stay indefinitely. 
For the sake of argument, just imagine that we did decide to arrive and 
settle in Holland, uninvited and without a visa and then had the audacity 
to brutally and violently take control of the means of production of that 
economy […] Just imagine what the Dutch people would say (and do) in 
response to our unethical actions!
ibid., 155
Richards (ibid., 2–​3) describes pre-​settlement Cape Town as a ‘bustling port’, 
run by ‘internationally travelled, educated and commercially knowledgeable 
Khoisan leaders, who learned English and Dutch [and] understood global 
macro-​economics and the dynamics of supply and demand in the context 
of international market forces’. Coree’s time in England is likened to a form 
of international education, and his tactics to pressure the Dutch as imposing 
‘economic sanctions’ (ibid., 130–​131). Autshumato, is similarly referenced as the 
‘Cape Town-​based strategic communications expert and international liaison 
officer ensuring accurate communication was passed on from one ship to the 
other as they passed through the port of Cape Town [with] impeccable […] 
local and international credentials’ (ibid., 4, 133). Richards (2017, 239) debunks

Chapter 4
misconceptions that Autshumato was ‘a beach-​bum roaming and strolling 
along the Blouberg/​Milnerton beach front providing language translation ser­
vices (i.e. interpreter) to the captains of passing ships’ (ibid., 5). He refuses to 
merely refer to them as interpreters because this does not do justice to their 
other important functions and talents (ibid., 239). In a telling footnote, Richards 
explicates his Khoisan revivalism by noting how his ‘own experience provides 
some clues to understanding Autshumato’s predicament’ and vice versa:
In spite of attaining my technical and academic qualifications on merit, 
some of which include degrees attained in Europe and the USA, there 
is still that niggly feeling of never quite being accepted as an equal. 
Admittedly, this might have more to do with an outsider-​insider perspec­
tive or a South Africa versus international prejudice, more than it has to 
do with a black-​white race factor. However, for many in South Africa, I 
am first a coloured (Khoisan), and that then provides the lenses through 
which people view my other qualifications and professional achieve­
ments and experience.
ibid., 134
The anachronistic language to describe historical persons as well as the early 
encounters between colonialists and Khoisan is typical of Khoisan revivalists’ 
engagements with the past. While Richards is particularly successful at getting 
his message across, he is of course not alone in spreading awareness about 
forgotten or undervalued figures from the past. Joseph Little has always been 
driven to reframe the way figures in Khoisan history were portrayed. In 2009, 
he for instance wrote an article for Eland Nuus (2009d, 15) describing how the 
Khoisan were skilled at learning foreign languages and cunning in their resis­
tance to colonialism, facts he believed went widely unacknowledged. enn is 
also strongly committed to reclaiming Khoisan history, for instance by calling 
for official holidays to celebrate their legacies (enn 2013a, 8). The newspaper 
regularly devotes segments to ‘honouring the sacrifices of Khoisan heroes’ 
(enn 2016a, 2–​10), such as David Stuurman, the ‘unrelenting rebel’ from the 
18th and 19th century who escaped twice from Robben Island, or Coree, the 
‘Girachoqua resistance hero’ who prevented the establishment of a British 
penal colony in the early 17th century.13 Another figure who often gets praised 
by Khoisan revivalists is Doman, ‘the hero of the first Khoi-​war’ and a ‘military

strategist’. During his time in Batavia he is said to have noticed that the muskets 
and cannons of the Dutch frequently malfunctioned during rainfall, which he 
supposedly drew upon when mounting counterattacks in his later resistance 
campaigns. In reflecting on Doman’s historical significance in the same edition 
of enn, Lucelle Campbell takes away explicit lessons for how to look for lega­
cies of Khoisan history in the present:
One can uncover his great skills of multilingualism, political shrewdness 
[…] understanding of the economy with a most astute military talent. 
A keen spy for his people, leader, fighter and spokesperson […] Truth is, 
you will not hear these stories from mom and dad, maybe they are too 
ashamed to tell you or they do not know. Or they just don’t care. Yet, if 
we should dare to take a closer look, we start to grow to understand the 
neighbour, the cashier at the till point, the librarian’s tone of voice, the 
Rasta selling indigenous herbs, the preacher on the train, or the hawker 
selling his greens on the pavement. Only then will I come close to know­
ing my true heritage. Do we really know why we are led to believe that the 
chain of events pre-​apartheid has little or no bearing on our lives today?

At the book launch of Griekwa Held [Griqua Hero], an historical overview of 
the life of a.a.s. Le Fleur I, compiled by Willa Boezak (2019; see Chapter 2), in 
July 2018, Cecil Le Fleur likewise announced that this was not a book that ‘you 
should hide under the mattress, but show all visitors’. Moreover, through the 
involvement of Bredekamp, who contributed a chapter on the legacy of the 
‘Griqua hero’, Le Fleur celebrated Griekwa Held as a ‘unique combo between 
our people’s contribution and validation by academic scholars’. In the fore­
word, Le Fleur explains why this was such a significant feat:
Until now, the significant and indisputable role played by Paramount 
Chief a.a.s Le Fleur I in the history of South Africa has only been revealed 
by researchers and historians outside the domain of the Griqua people’s 
movement. This frequently led to mistrust of the factual content of the 
work by Griqua readers. It is still a well-​known fact that most authors still 
lean heavily on Eurocentric sources and consciously or subconsciously 
give a version that represents the dominant group in history.

Chapter 4
Basil Coetzee too wrote Tears of the Praying Mantis to contend with the 
Eurocentric bias in Khoisan history. As I showed in Chapter 3, when he began 
being involved with the cchdc, Coetzee (06/​05/​2018) was concerned that his­
torical materials were seemingly only accessible to (White) academics: ‘In our 
communities there is not a single book about the Khoi. I looked for all of them 
in libraries. Nothing […] I want those books to be in our libraries. It is a delib­
erate attempt to suppress our history’. The only available history is that of ‘the 
oppressor […] a negative history that nobody wanted to associate themselves 
with’. As a history buff who regularly posts on social media to share his views 
on the past and more recently through ‘educative poetry’ (Coetzee 2019a), 
Coetzee decided in 2010 to write a book of his own and put forward a counter-​
interpretation of the past to fight the identity crisis.14 This is indeed his ulti­
mate ambition for Tears of the Praying Mantis, as evidenced by his insistence 
on having the book launch take place in Mitchells Plain, where he has lived for 
several decades and is well-​known for his community activism: ‘Media cov­
erage of the area is very negative. I want to show that books such as this can 
also come out of Mitchells Plain’ (Basil Coetzee, 06/​05/​2018). In an interesting 
parallel with Richards (and indeed various other Khoisan revivalist authors), 
Coetzee (25/​04/​2018) describes Tears of the Praying Mantis as a ‘a personal 
odyssey’ saturated with historical elements. The book pursues several aims by 
drawing on both autobiographical reflections and interpretations of Khoisan 
history. Echoing the identity crisis thesis, Coetzee (2019b, 22) argues through­
out the text how colonialism has rendered the Khoi ‘physically and mentally 
traumatized, rejected and spurned in the accounts of history’ and propagated 
the notion that Coloureds are ‘a people without substance or presence of being’. 
He explains how certain laws, such as the Population Registration Act of 1950 
or Ordinance 50 of 1828, were instrumental in alienating the Khoi. Reflecting 
on how the Khoi today relate (or do not relate) to their past as a result, Coetzee 
decries how effective these tactics were at getting them to internalize a sense 
of inferiority:
	14	
Basil Coetzee is certainly not alone in dedicating his written work to combatting the iden­
tity crisis. In 2019, Gregory Edwards self-​published The Table Mountain Story, a children’s 
book that seeks to explain Khoisan culture and history in an accessible way. In an inter­
view for The Daily Voice (Duval 2019), Edwards explains that he sees his work as a contri­
bution to the fight against the ‘identity crisis’. A similar motivation sparked the idea for 
Return to the Kalahari –​ The Hoerikwaggo Chronicles (Origin Story), a graphic novel series 
I say more about in my ma thesis (Verbuyst 2015, 105).

The Khoisan Identity Discourse (i)
181
We turned out to be our own strangers, alienated from our culture 
and identity […] and became like the proverbial tree detached from 
its own roots causing a slow and distressing demise of self […] We are 
still estranged from our land […] removed from our ancient faith and 
tongueless in our original language, Khoikhoi-​Gowab […] [The] reality 
today is that our people and particularly the youth look to gangsters as 
their role-​models. The disgusting and vile language of gangsterism has 
become the language of our streets. The dress-​code resembles the dress-​
code of American gangsters […] Is this our destiny? Was what happened 
to Krotoa her destiny? She was after-​all the first Khoikhoi woman to be 
converted to the Dutch Reformed version of Christianity, and it so hap­
pened that it was the same Dutch Christians that would refuse to accept 
our people as fellow Christians.
coetzee 2019b, xiii, 39, 217
I return to Krotoa at length in the next section. What I want to illustrate with 
this segment is Coetzee’s take on the identity crisis, as well as his criticism of 
the Catholic Church, the book’s main focus. He also regularly brought this up 
during our conversations:
Hundreds of missionaries came to South Africa. The first thing they did 
was to remove your identity, second thing was ownership of land, third 
declaring your customs as heathen. So they owned your heritage, we 
could not access our graves or sacred sites. People do not know what our 
sacred sites are anymore.
basil coetzee, 25/​04/​2018
Coetzee strives to restore this forgotten link to the Khoi and their spirituality, 
which is why he chose Tears of the Praying Mantis as the title. According to 
him, Coloureds never hurt a praying mantis, but they do not know that this 
practice dates back to the animal’s status as a God in Khoi spirituality (Basil 
Coetzee, 25/​04/​2018). To re-​evaluate these types of ancient connections, the 
Dutch Reformed Church needs to acknowledge and be held accountable for 
its role in the destruction of Khoisan identity (Coetzee 2019b, xiii). The fact 
that they previously recognized their complicity in apartheid was deliber­
ately short-​sighted. Aside from allocating the blame for colonialism with the 
responsible parties, Coetzee also seeks to contrast grim present-​day outlooks 
with an idealized depiction of precolonial Khoisan society:

Chapter 4
As Khoikhoi people we lived a life of serenity, in harmony with nature, liv­
ing off it and in accordance with the natural laws of the land. We believed 
that God owns the land as the Creator thereof and that we were the cus­
todians of the land and animals. We were a spiritual people who saw God 
in His creation, the universe, the animals and the resources needed for 
Man to sustain himself. We healed the sick, and cared for the elderly. 
Animals were not killed for leisure but for consuming uses only and to 
aid in supporting our livelihoods. Family units were sustained with the 
raising of children of utmost importance.
coetzee 2019b, xvii
Attributing the precolonial Khoisan the values that contemporary soci­
ety is judged to lack is a widespread practice among Khoisan revivalists. In 
this sense, the Khoisan past becomes a panacea for the present, a source of 
escape and inspiration by imagining how things were (and could be) differ­
ent. To clarify, I am not commenting on the accuracy of these interpretations; 
I am merely highlighting a common aspect of Khoisan revivalists’ engage­
ments with the past. Indeed, similar themes permeate the work of William 
Langeveldt. Langeveldt is a prominent Khoisan revivalist, having, among other 
things, given a presentation at the 2001 conference, sat on the nkc, staffed the 
crlc, and represented South Africa at the United Nations Permanent Forum 
on Indigenous Issues. When I met Langeveldt at his home in Cape Town, 
I quickly realized just how committed he is to Khoisan revivalism. One of the 
walls of his living room is completely covered by a local artist’s rendering of the 
defeat of D’Almeida in 1510 –​ an event he often references. Langeveldt was born 
in Vryburg in the North West Province but lived in Cape Town intermittently 
thereafter. As he recounts on the cover of one of his books, those who are 
first will be last and those who are last will be first! (Langeveldt 
2016; original emphasis), he was ‘dehumanised at birth as his birth certificate 
states his ethnicity as “mixed”, not Korana’. He was assigned a ‘Christian slave 
name’ and his mother did not teach him any indigenous language because it 
was regarded as a ‘baboon language’ and speaking it would ‘result in a beat­
ing’. Not unlike the story of Johann Abrahams, who also studied in the USA, 
Langeveldt began to critically reflect on his youth and identity while he was 
studying for his ma and PhD degrees at the University of Iowa. Aside from par­
ticipating in a powwow with Native Americans, he specifically recalls a campus 
debate about indigenous languages in 1986 (William Langeveldt, 27/​03/​2018). 
When Langeveldt explained that he spoke Afrikaans and English, members of 
the audience were reportedly confused and asked him why he did not speak

‘his own indigenous language’. This episode led him down an ongoing path of 
self-​discovery and confrontation with the identity crisis:
People have been lied to that they are Coloured. There is no Coloured 
language There are only brown people, light-​skinned and dark-​skinned 
variations. So who are we? […] It took me many years to discover who I 
am […] Slowly I put the history together and I began to understand what 
it is all about, how we got here and where we are going […] As a Coloured 
you are constantly humiliated, insulted and that has an impact on your 
self-​esteem. How do you revive coming from this background? Which 
programs do you put in place?
william langeveldt, 27/​03/​2018
Back in South Africa after the end of apartheid, Langeveldt indeed devoted 
himself entirely to Khoisan revivalism, working with communities across 
the country and the bodies I just mentioned. He experienced a great deal of 
mockery and disbelief at the possibility of ‘bringing back the culture’, but look­
ing back he feels his ‘perseverance has been rewarded’ with Khoisan culture 
alive and kicking again (William Langeveldt, 12/​03/​2018). Langeveldt draws on 
these experiences in his work, which includes several books. Like many other 
Khoisan revivalists, he understood how a new interpretation of history was 
required to change people’s minds. As Langeveldt explains in those who are 
first will be last and those who are last will be first!:
Every time when our people appear on television everything about them 
is negative […] there is supposedly nothing beautiful about the first nation 
Khoin and San Africans. The brutal and inhumane ‘white’ history of colo­
nial slave-​masters that conquered our ancestors in the most horrific ways 
deliberately set out to erase our true history from our native minds, espe­
cially the missionaries, our enslavers that colonised our minds and mis­
led our people with their constant exploitation and exclusion […] The 
‘coloured’ speak other people’s languages, imitate other people’s cultures; 
desire other people’s lifestyles; wear other people’s clothes, eat other 
people ‘s food; buy other peoples products; accept other peoples’ names 
and place names, and on top of it all, are ruled by other people […] The 
Historic Factor is the cultural cement that unite the people as a whole, to 
experience collective continuity […] Our historic consciousness creates 
feelings of social cohesion […] being a conscious co-​creator of your life.

Chapter 4
While Langeveldt’s books also contain information about indigenous med­
icine, concise Khoekhoegowab lessons, and excerpts from Khoisan mythology 
(see e.g. Langeveldt 2016, 73), he largely paves the way towards this ‘conscious­
ness’ in typical Khoisan revivalist fashion. Through extensive use of bold, cap­
italized, or underlined text, Langeveldt lays bare legacies of colonialism by 
attributing blame and identifying ‘historiese trauma en slawe mentaliteit […] 
aangeleerde hulpeloosheid, gebrek aan motivering [historical trauma and slave 
mentality […] learned helplessness and lack of motivation]’ (Langeveldt 2012, 
4). He for instance argues that the colonial practice of reimbursing labour 
with alcohol accounts for the high rate of alcoholism, crime, and murder in 
Coloured communities: the self-​destruction of peoples’ lives (Langeveldt 2016, 
38). Langeveldt suggests these negative attributes were alien to the precolonial 
Khoisan, who lived in ‘the most egalitarian society on planet earth’. Colonialism 
brought ‘korrupsie, oorheersing, diefstal [corruption, domination, theft]’, but 
indigenous society was one of ‘menslikheid, empatie, soorgsaamheid, gasv­
ryheid, eerlikheid en nederigheid. Wedersydse erkenning en glykheid vir almal, 
veral tussen mans en vrouens [humanity, empathy, caring, hospitality, honesty, 
and humility. Mutual recognition and equality, especially between man and 
woman]’ (Langeveldt 2001, 70, 71). The Khoisan enjoyed abundance, peace, 
and self-​sustainability: ‘Everybody had equal access to all land resources’, 
the ‘indigenous restorative justice system’ was more humane, and there was 
‘renewable energy production and purified water’ (Langeveldt 2012,6; 2016, 15–​
17). Langeveldt seeks to recuperate these ancient values to resist ‘forced assim­
ilation into the English language and culture of hypocrisy and exploitation’ 
(enn 2014j, 6). He calls for ‘spiritual healing’ to put an end to the ‘[p]‌sychology 
of jealousy, mistrust, backstabbing’ (Langeveldt 2016, 104). It is not always clear 
what this healing entails, but history and pedagogy play key roles:
The level of a person’s self-​esteem depends on the levels of positive 
information he got about himself from childhood –​ what you know or 
do not know about your own history as first Africans […] We must learn 
to celebrate ourselves so that self-​celebration becomes self-​healing […] 
Reclaiming our First Nation History means to conduct investigations into 
own family-​, community-​, and peoples history, and South African history 
from an indigenous perspective. This is a kind of psycho-​education to 
prepare participants for their journey of healing.
langeveldt 2016, 21, 83
Langeveldt conforms to a pattern in Khoisan revivalism, hopefully apparent at 
this stage, whereby pride is sought in a renewed interpretation of the Khoisan

past, poised to counter currently prevailing views that are said to be at the 
base of the identity crisis and related social ills. There is one last author I want 
to mention as he does not only pursue this ambition by writing books but 
also through a self-​funded museum.15 Aaron Messelaar is High Commissioner 
in the Griqua Royal House, which strives to unite all Griqua factions (Aaron 
Messelaar, 06/​10/​2017). He was born in Campbell in the Northern Cape, where 
Griqua culture is still practiced, but he moved to Cape Town to work as a 
police officer and then in social services, ‘particularly in gangster areas’ such 
as Valhalla Park (Aaron Messelaar, 16/​03/​2018). Messelaar, who was well aware 
of his roots at the time, was struck by the lack of historical awareness among 
Coloureds in Cape Town. In 1999, he opened an office in Elsies River ‘focussing 
on culture and tradition’ (not to be confused with the Katz Korana satellite 
office mentioned previously) and he ran ‘awareness campaigns’ all over the 
Western Cape for several years (Aaron Messelaar, 06/​10/​2017). Years later he 
also started writing books to create awareness about Griqua culture. In the 
foreword to the tellingly titled book, Forgotten But Not Buried (2015), which, 
like Griqua Cultures and Superstitions (2018), covers various Griqua cultural 
practices, Adam Kok v sums up its spirit succinctly:
For far too long the history of our people has been portrayed by outsiders. 
It is heartening to, at last, have it told by a true son of the Griquas […] It is 
through these efforts that we, the dormant descendants of the Khoi and 
San people, have come to realize that we have a history to be proud of 
and not that as reflected through foreigners. We have traditions unique 
to us and not practices adopted from others, we have (had) land that was 
taken from us and have a right to proclaim and live out our traditions in 
the country of our forefathers.
kok 2015, iii–​iv
In 2009, Messelaar transformed his office in Elsies River into a small-​scale 
self-​funded museum. Figure 4 shows the entrance to the building. With the 
residential buildings on the left, the picture captures its raison d’être. These 
two or three storey buildings were built across the Cape Flats to provide social 
housing and are commonly associated in popular imagination with the worst 
kind of living conditions in the area (Jensen 1999, 76). At some point a meme

Calls for a Khoisan-​run museum are often made by Khoisan revivalists (see Chapter 6). 
The 2013 site catalogue of the Khoisan Heritage Route also mentioned plans for the devel­
opment of a ‘Cape Town Community-​based Khoe Museum’, although these have not been 
followed up on to date (Department of Arts and Culture 2013a, 1).

circulated on social media, juxtaposing a picture of these types of buildings 
with a historical illustration depicting the living conditions of the Khoisan 
prior to colonialism. The intention was clearly to underline how current harsh 
housing conditions and high levels of poverty and population density were 
a consequence of colonialism. The same contrast is deliberately pursued 
through the decision to open the museum in the area. As Messelaar (06/​10/​
2017) explained, people in areas like these are drawn to gangs and ‘do not know 
who they are […] there is the identity crisis’. The museum wants to fight this by 
inviting schools and churches to visit, in particular, ‘to make sure the history 
is among us’. The museum shows that they have a culture to be proud of and 
that their forbears lived in drastically different conditions and according to 
different values (see Figure 5). As an article in enn (2017b, 10) explains, visit­
ing the museum is like a form of time-​travelling ‘[w]‌ith the Griqua flag promi­
nently displayed, indigenous artefacts, indigenous medicinal stones and roots, 
indigenous craft ware, pots, shoes, documents, time-​aged photographs, royal 
indigenous garments, staffs, indigenous weaponry, coinage, and even furniture 
from the Griqua and other Khoisan indigenous groups dating back several 
centuries’.
When I visited the museum in 2017, I noticed how Messelaar had indeed 
jam-​packed an interesting collection of materials relating to the Khoisan 
in a rather confined space. Next to ‘Khoisan woman traditional regalia’ and 
the male counterpart, there was a set of kudu horns, ‘used to burn herbs for

cleansing ceremony’, as the adjoining label read. The walls were covered with 
various texts providing historical information, much of which seems to have 
been photocopied from books. On display as well were flags from the United 
Nations and the Griqua. Messelaar also dedicated a corner of the museum 
to Krotoa, as he felt it important that visitors learned about her life in par­
ticular. While certain other figures from Khoisan history such as Autshumato 
or Sarah Baartman are frequently mentioned, Krotoa is by far the most com­
monly referred to historical figure by Khoisan revivalists. In the final section, 
I use Krotoa as a case study to show how and why some of the characteristics 
of Khoisan revivalists’ engagements with the past I have tackled thus far are 
applied to a specific historical figure.
4.2.3	
Recuperating Khoisan Heroes: The Case of Krotoa
The 17th century Khoisan woman Krotoa first appeared in written sources in Jan 
van Riebeeck’s Daghregister, when he records that the niece of Autshumato, a 
12-​year-​old girl, is joining their household. She became an interpreter between 
the Dutch and the Khoisan, splitting her time between them. After she was 
baptized as Eva, Krotoa married and had several children with the Danish sur­
geon Pieter van Meerhoff. After van Meerhoff died while in Madagascar and 
Khoisan society at the Cape disintegrated, van Riebeeck went back to Europe 
and Krotoa was banished to Robben Island and prevented from seeing her chil­
dren. She developed an alcohol addiction and died shortly afterwards in 1674.

Chapter 4
As I will show in this section, my attempted summary of Krotoa’s life would 
not be acceptable to everyone. One runs into a whole range of challenges and 
dilemmas when writing about her life. Christina Landman (1996, 30) pointed 
out how ‘Krotoa had no opportunity to tell her own story […] The Khoekhoe 
themselves were muted on this subject [….] Only white men, travellers from 
Europe, wrote about the Khoekhoe’. Confronted with this problem in Chapter 2, 
I opted for an approach not unlike the one suggested by Landman: ‘a decon­
struction of European representations of the Khoekhoe […] through a social-​
critical reading of the relevant texts’. All the while, Krotoa will likely remain a 
‘story-​generator’ because the existing sources leave much open to interpreta­
tion and her life is deemed so significant (ibid., 35). Krotoa has indeed inspired 
a wide range of artists, writers, and academics from various backgrounds 
(see e.g. Coetzee 1998, 113–​114; Dunton 2015, 38). Novels, articles, books, chil­
dren’s books, and plays have presented narratives about Krotoa, with themes 
as varied as alienation, gender rights, nation-​building, Afrikaner-​nationalism, 
oppression, savagery, or syncretism.
While the story of Krotoa has been told for centuries, it was done so by an 
academic of Khoisan extraction for the first time in 1996. In her ground-​break­
ing essay, Was Eva Raped? An Exercise in Speculative History, Yvette Abrahams 
(1996, 4, 5) opens by flagging the almost unsurmountable Eurocentric bias 
in the sources; ‘the memory of her enemies’ is all she has to go on. Writing 
firmly in the tradition of Khoisan revisionist historiography, she argues that 
the existing historiography is based on an uncritical reading of these sources 
and unjustly portrays Krotoa as torn between her loyalties to the Dutch and 
the Khoisan as a result: ‘a woman between’, as one influential historian put it 
(Malherbe 1990). Abrahams (1996, 10) instead choses a speculative approach 
and reads the sources against the grain. She discloses her Khoisan revivalism 
at the onset: she writes about Krotoa because ‘her experience of colonialism 
was later to be repeated by thousands of Khoisan women’ and is therefore 
highly relevant to the Khoisan today (Abrahams 1996, 3). Abrahams (ibid., 
5) is out to ‘reclaim history’ so that any chance to ‘reobjectify’ the Khoisan will 
be avoided. According to her, Krotoa remained loyal to the Khoisan and was 
in fact coerced into cooperating with the Dutch. She specifically argues that 
Krotoa suffered from Rape Trauma Syndrome after being sexually assaulted by 
Jan van Riebeeck (ibid., 15). Abrahams (ibid., 3) recognizes that her approach 
does not conform to ‘ordinary rules of evidence’ but believes her analysis of the 
evolving relationship between Van Riebeeck and Krotoa is convincing. Writing 
about Sarah Baartman in her PhD thesis later on, Abrahams explains why rely­
ing on her personal experiences is vital in framing such interpretations and 
formulating hypotheses:

The Khoisan Identity Discourse (i)

Personal experience as a historical datum poses a peculiar epistemologi­
cal challenge. From my point of view, it offers certainty. My personal expe­
rience is a datum I can be absolutely sure of. My historical experience is 
such that I yield to none a better claim to expertise on sexism and racism.
abrahams 2000, 75
Abrahams’ work anticipated a whole range of Khoisan revivalist engagements 
with Krotoa along these lines. As I noted in Chapter 2, she warned early on that 
if academia would not address their concerns, Khoisan revivalists would look 
for their history elsewhere. Reflecting on her academic career and work on 
Baartman specifically (see Chapter 6), Abrahams underscored the importance 
of history in framing her own identity:
Constructing ourselves as self-​loving subjects sounded just like what I 
needed. I wanted to be finished with rehashing old white insults. The very 
next thing I wanted to do was [Baartman’s] biography […] I do not seek 
to claim her suffering. There is more than enough of that going around to 
need to take another’s share. I do identify with it. Pain, though unendur­
able at the time, is easily forgotten when it is over. Ultimately, all that is 
going to matter is that we can be Khoekhoe again.
abrahams 2007, 439, 450
Engaging with figures like Baartman or Krotoa proved empowering and thera­
peutic for others as well. Abrahams was among those involved in such an act of 
Khoisan revivalism in August 2016, when Krotoa’s ‘soul’ was repatriated from 
the Groote Kerk in Central Cape Town, where her physical remains are believed 
to lie, to the Castle of Good Hope.16 The ceremony, which involved a large con­
tingent of Khoisan revivalists, including Mackie, Zenzile Khoisan, and Ron 
Martin, was initiated by gathering around a tree near the church and perform­
ing a ritual to summon Krotoa’s spirit, which was then transported by horse 
carriage back to the Castle (Etheridge 2016). The ceremony was part of the cel­
ebrations marking 350 years of the Castle’s existence, which also involved a 
‘symbolic reclaiming ceremony’ of the building to initiate a long-​term process

of healing.17 Once ‘Krotoa’ was back at the Castle, which still stations personnel 
from the South African Defence Force, Nosiviwe Mapisa-​Nqakula, the Minister 
of Defence and Military Veterans wished that more knew about ‘this incred­
ibly resilient woman whose true account of her life was never told’, despite 
being exemplary of what ‘millions of women in our country’ had to endure. 
The ceremony ended with the unveiling of a commemorative wooden bench. 
Meanwhile, some Khoisan revivalists, including Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras, were 
outside protesting the fact that Krotoa was brought back to a place where she 
had experienced so much suffering.18 They also felt a bench was deeply offen­
sive and claimed they were insufficiently consulted in the planning process 
(February 2016; Bam, Van Sitters and Ndhlovu 2018, 166–​168).
In September 2015, many of the same protesters vandalized another com­
memorative bench that stood nearby at the intersection of Castle Street and St 
George’s Mall. The concrete bench, known as Krotoa’s place, was covered with 
colourful mosaics, including a rendering of Krotoa, and was donated by the 
ngo Rock Girl sa on Women’s Day 2012 as part of its safe spaces for women 
campaign.19 The ngo chose Krotoa as she symbolized the struggle of women 
in the country at large. Chantal Revell (19/​08/​2019) believes the protesters had 
not done ‘their proper research’, as the bench was created by someone who 
wanted to trace back the history of gender violence in the country to its begin­
nings, not unlike Khoisan revivalists (see below). Many Khoisan revivalists 
had indeed endorsed the project (Jolly 2016). To the protesters in question, 
however, it was disrespectful to ‘sit’ on Krotoa’s ‘face’ and they would have pre­
ferred a statue instead (Olifant 2015). Duane Jethro (2017, 350–​351) argues that 
the bench’s destruction constituted ‘an ancient form of indigenous religious 
action’ and describes how the group carefully ‘unpacked artisans’ implements’ 
to attack the bench. In the settlement that was reached two years later, all 
charges were dropped and the bench was restored. It no longer depicts Krotoa 
and includes a placard with historical background (Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras, 
11/​07/​2018). This was a victory for Kleinhans-​Cedras. Mackie concurred but 
gave me a different account of the events, putting in doubt Jethro’s claims that

it was a premediated act to religiously ‘recover’ the sacred site of the bench 
(Jethro 2017, 351). Mackie explained how he and roughly 25 others had gath­
ered in District Six to organize something to mark Heritage Month (Mackie, 
02/​07/​2018). The suggestion to protest Krotoa’s place gained traction, and the 
group set off with the intention of laying down flowers on the location, chant­
ing and praying in the process. As Mackie began to address the disrespect of 
Krotoa’s legacy, he ‘got riled up’. When he noticed a crowbar lying at a nearby 
construction site, he worked himself up into somewhat of a frenzy and pro­
ceeded to attack the bench. A handful of others soon joined in.
Whether premeditated or not, the reason for attacking the bench was 
clearly to signal their contempt for fraught representations of Krotoa in South 
African society. As differing opinions about Krotoa’s place illustrate, there 
is rarely agreement across the board over how unsatisfactory these repre­
sentations are or what to do about them. However, Khoisan revivalists were 
unanimous in their dismissal of Krotoa, the motion picture directed and pro­
duced by Roberta Durrant and written by Kaye Ann Williams and Margaret 
Goldsmid. The biopic was highly anticipated in South Africa as it was praised 
at various international film festivals (Kemp 2017). The movie presented a ‘rare 
and precious opportunity for healing and instilling pride over a key figure in 
South Africa’s history, someone who serves as a reminder of place and belong­
ing in the minds of those who consider themselves coloured and descendants 
of the Khoi’ (October 2017). Durrant and Williams collaborated previously on 
a documentary about Krotoa for the national broadcasting network, sabc, in 
2013.20 Various (Khoisan revivalist) intellectuals, including Henry Bredekamp 
and Yvette Abrahams, commented on Krotoa’s life and legacy, suggesting that 
Krotoa’s survival against all odds was inspiring to women on the Cape Flats, 
that she initiated the liberation struggle, and that her navigation of Dutch 
and Khoisan culture embodied a kind of praiseworthy reconciliatory spirit. 
Afterwards, Durrant and Williams realized the potential for a ‘strong fictional 
narrative feature inspired by historical fact and speculation’ (Matroos 2017). 
Williams believed a movie about Krotoa could ‘uncover’ the undervalued and 
unrecognized role of women in ‘South Africa’s multi-​racial history’. Moreover, 
classified Coloured, shooting the film made her reflect on ‘racial tension and 
misogyny’ and ‘appreciate my physical self’. Durrant, who is White, on the other 
hand, believed Krotoa was a ‘visionary’ by looking for ways for the Dutch and 
the Khoisan to coexist (Cornwell 2017). On the eve of the premiere, Durrant

was excited about the movie’s reception in South Africa: ‘it’s only up from here’ 
(Matroos 2017). She would be in for a rude awakening, however, particularly 
when it came to the reactions of Khoisan revivalists.
The latter turned out in droves to attend the premiere in Cape Town on 
31 July 2017, the eve of Women’s Month in South Africa. During the crowded 
reception that was held in front of the three theatres where the movie would be 
shown later that night, I spotted a number of familiar faces. Zenzile was going 
around taking pictures. Mackie was present too as part of Hennie van Wyk’s 
Goringhaiqua delegation (see Chapter 3). Donned in full regalia, they seemed 
eager to get their photograph taken by journalists and others present. After 
most of the guests trickled in, Durrant delivered her speech. The acoustics were 
awful, but I made out references to the importance of language and recogniz­
ing the Khoisan’s contemporary existence, without specifically acknowledging 
those who were present. Durrant seems to have anticipated some of the incom­
ing backlash, as she warned the movie might make some ‘angry and confused’, 
and reconsider their identities. Then again, she affirmed, this was actually one 
of the aims of the movie. I made sure to follow the Khoisan revivalists into the 
theatre they had chosen as I anticipated they might express some noteworthy 
reactions during the screening. As some of the more controversial scenes were 
shown, they were indeed met with widespread disapproval from the crowd. 
After the movie was finished the mood was somewhat anticlimactic as most 
people went straight home.
The overall reception of Krotoa by Khoisan revivalists was indeed nega­
tive. Sylvia Vollenhoven needed time to write a response, as the movie had 
left her ‘deeply traumatised’ (Van Niekerk 2017). It is not hard to see why 
Khoisan revivalists are disappointed. Krotoa opened with the caveat ‘inspired 
by historical facts’, but this did not prevent it from being lambasted for factual 
inaccuracies. The movie was attacked on multiple fronts, too much to cover 
here, but the main critique was that it downplayed the violent character of 
Dutch colonialism. As the artist Blaqpearl, who I come back to below, put it, 
Jan van Riebeeck initiated colonialism in South Africa: ‘how did you manage 
to underplay that?’ (Philander 2017). Van Riebeeck was also portrayed by a 
handsome actor, despite being ‘fat and ugly in reality’, as one Khoisan revival­
ist put it (Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras, 11/​07/​2018). For Basil Coetzee (22/​06/​2018), 
the Khoekhoegowab language was the only believable element in the other­
wise ‘pathetic’ movie. Other than the rape scene, Van Riebeeck is not shown 
in a negative light, and his well-​documented disdain for the Khoisan is absent. 
Van Riebeeck’s relationship with Krotoa is indeed widely regarded as histor­
ically inaccurate, offensive, and inappropriately sexualized. In the aftermath 
of the rape by Van Riebeeck, which Durrant argued was necessary to capture

his ‘forbidden lust’ and their ‘complicated relationship’, Krotoa forgives him 
and develops feelings for him, most vividly expressed through an even more 
controversial masturbation scene (Kemp 2017). The Khoisan in the movie, for 
their part, reject Krotoa because of what happened to her and are shown to 
stubbornly resist her plea to share the land with the Dutch. Van Riebeeck on 
the other hand emerges as a benevolent colonialist, eager to establish peace 
and trade with the Khoisan. The movie seems to suggest that, if people on both 
sides had been more like Van Riebeeck and Krotoa, forward-​thinkers but man 
and woman-​‘between’, respectively (see above), a peaceful coexistence could 
have ensued.
Durrant did not expect this degree of backlash and defended Krotoa by 
arguing that different sides of Krotoa had to feature in the movie to ‘paint 
the picture as accurately as possible’ and avoid ‘one-​dimensional characters’ 
(Cornwell 2017; Kekana 2017).21 Williams, who grew up on the Cape Flats and 
therefore dismissed charges of being a ‘white colonist’, also explained why 
she did not portray Van Riebeeck as a villain, as originally planned (Kekana 
2017). The focus, she reminded her critics, was on Krotoa, whose depiction she 
believed was still inspirational to ‘young coloured women’ (Philander 2017). 
Khoisan revivalists like Chantal Revell (19/​08/​2019) believe differently and 
wonder why they were not more included in writing or starring in the movie. 
This might have changed the storyline, such as the final lines that are shown in 
the movie highlighting that the descendants of Krotoa include the pro-​apart­
heid stalwarts Piet Willem Botha and Hendrik Verwoerd. Many Khoisan reviv­
alists regretted that they, or Coloureds in general, were not mentioned. I also 
recall a casual conversation with a Khoisan revivalist on the campus of uct in 
this regard. For the woman I was speaking with, the 2016 reburial ceremony 
of Krotoa had been the gateway to her Khoisan revivalism. She understood 
that Krotoa was a work of fiction and therefore needed to cater to a diverse 
audience, but she would have preferred to see Krotoa emerge as a strong 
and empowered woman at the end, even if she knows that is not what ‘really 
happened’.22
	21	
Controversies regarding who qualifies to write or participate in fictions about historical 
Khoisan figures extend beyond Krotoa. Khoisan revivalists were for instance upset at 
rumours that Beyoncé might play Sarah Baartman in a possible Hollywood movie about 
her life (Parkinson 2016a).
	22	
Krotoa does end on somewhat of a Khoisan revivalist-​inspired note, with a scene showing 
Krotoa criticizing Dutch colonialism and reaffirming her Khoisan identity and rejecting 
Dutch culture.

Chapter 4
As Zenzile Khoisan and Debbie Hendricks put it in their review of Krotoa 
in enn (2017b, 3), a consensus emerged among Khoisan revivalists that the 
time had come to tell their own stories and to relate to Krotoa in ways that 
were meaningful to them in the first place. enn previously lauded Krotoa as 
a ‘heroic figure, brilliant linguist and early diplomat, who is considered one 
of the founding mothers of modern South Africa’ in this regard (enn 2016a, 
10). As I showed briefly, authors such as Basil Coetzee also dedicated various 
sections of their work to Krotoa, highlighting her ill-​treatment by colonialists, 
her unrecognized status in South African historiography, and the Khoisan 
revivalist-​message her story embodies. In a poem entitled Krotoa, Die Khoi 
Meisie!, Coetzee (2019a, 44–​45) for instance portrays Krotoa not only as an 
unrecognized victim of colonialism but also praises her ingenuity and the fact 
that ‘sy het steeds haar naam onthou [always remembered her [true] name]’, 
which he asks his readers to do as well to make her whole again. Krotoa also 
frequently featured in another capacity, which had also motivated the creators 
of Krotoa, as a relatable victim of abuse.23 According to Chantal Revell (19/​08/​
2019), who regularly refers to Krotoa when speaking about her Khoisan reviv­
alism, so many people relate to her story because they are themselves victims 
of abuse, particularly women and mothers. She is herself drawn to Krotoa 
because, like her, she grew up with an absent father and raised her kids as a 
single mother. In Revell’s interpretation of Khoisan history, the equal status 
between men and women was disrupted by colonialism, which instilled rela­
tionships of subjugation in its place (enn 2015, 6). During her speech at the 
Resurrection Day event in April 2018, she drew on these interpretations of 
Krotoa to argue that her story acted as a metaphor for Coloured history, par­
ticularly for women: ‘She had the first children of mixed ancestry, but nobody 
ever told us that […] She underwent the first identity crisis because she was 
never accepted by van Riebeeck and the others as one of them, even if she 
walked, spoke and talked like them’.
These and other interpretations of Krotoa’s life also featured in the play 
Krotoa van vandag. A story of identity, challenge and hope, written in 2016 
by the abovementioned artist from Mitchells Plain, Blaqpearl (Janine Van 
	23	
While Khoisan revivalists in Cape Town mostly relate to Krotoa, she is not the only 
Khoisan figure that is referenced to highlight issues of domestic abuse or gender violence. 
Sarah Baartman’s legacy too has been framed in this fashion (see Twidle 2013, 142). The 
Saartjie Baartman Centre for Women based in the Cape Flats for instance acts as a shelter 
for families fleeing domestic abuse since 1999 (‘The Saartjie Baartman Centre for Women 
and Children.’ http://​www.saa​rtji​ebaa​rtma​ncen​tre.org.za/​, accessed 20 March 2021).

Rooy-​Overmeyer).24 Known for her involvement in the collective of artists 
that starred in the 2010 musical Afrikaaps, which I elaborate on in Chapter 6, 
Blaqpearl also heads the Blaqpearl Foundation, an ngo engaged in arts and 
sports programs to ‘encourage youth to break away from and cope with the 
harsh realities and social ills such as gangsterism, substance abuse, teenage 
pregnancy/​parenting, amongst others that’s rife in the communities on the 
Cape Flats’.25 A large component of this involves activities where youth ‘learn 
a sense of identity, culture, self-​awareness and self-​love’. The play Krotoa van 
vandag, which toured schools across Cape Town in 2016, is an example of this, 
as it explicitly aims to show that positive things can come out of the Cape Flats 
and that its inhabitants do not lack ‘self-​pride’, as Blaqpearl put in a fundraising 
video (Maregele 2017). The Blaqpearl Foundation website explains how Krotoa 
van Vandag, which is performed mostly in Afrikaans but is suffused with 
elements of Khoekhoegowab, strives to accomplish this in Khoisan revivalist 
fashion:
It’s about the journey of a girl from […] the Cape Flats growing up in search 
of identity. The production depicts her various experiences, encounters 
& struggles, through music, poetry, storytelling, dance & dialogue, unto 
the point where she reaches the age of twenty five and embarks on a 
mission to research her roots and ancestry. Amongst this she finds her­
self in a peculiar ongoing conversation with her grandmother who tells 
her about Krotoa […] She tells her that her roots come from this woman 
Krotoa and guides her to places in Cape Town where she can learn even 
more about her story and culture. The girl, at first confused becomes 
very fascinated and starts reflecting towards the transition for her into

Other Khoisan revivalists have also written plays about Krotoa’s life. Sylvia Vollenhoven 
for instance wrote Krotoa –​ Eva van de Kaap, a Dutch/​South-​African collaboration 
directed by Basil Appollis. Unlike Krotoa van Vandag, which only ran locally, Krotoa –​ Eva 
van de Kaap was performed across South Africa and the Netherlands. However, while I did 
not manage to see the play for myself, reviews indicate that Krotoa –​ Eva van de Kaap was 
also set in contemporary South Africa and dealt with the legacies of Krotoa’s emotional 
and physical suffering (see ‘Krotoa’s story still shakes us –​ emotionally battered by clash

claiming her identity, in todays’ time. Realising that so much of Krotoa’s 
experiences still resonates in the lives of women today.26
The performance of Krotoa van Vandag in Beacon Hill High School in Mitchells 
Plain in August 2017 made the connections to Khoisan revivalism even more 
apparent. For one, prior to the play, Mackie addressed the audience of about 
250 people with songs in Khoekhoegowab as well as a speech about the colonial 
origins of Coloured Identity and the lack of recognition for the Khoisan. He 
also shared his dismay with the movie Krotoa and received some cheers when 
he informed them he was confident about winning the court case related to 
Krotoa’s Place. Before Mackie spoke, Mothers for Justice, a collective of moth­
ers who lost children in the gang-​related violence on the Cape Flats, briefly 
performed some dancing and spoke of the grief they had endured. The mood 
was set for the identity crisis thesis to be emphasized in the play itself. Indeed, 
as the excerpt from the website shows, the main character suffers in ways like 
the Mothers for Justice, leading her down a path of drugs and reckless partying. 
Her grandmother, played by Blaqpearl, tries to set her straight by telling her 
about Krotoa and reminding her that ‘jy het ‘n identity [you have an identity]’, 
a message the protagonist steadily warms up to and relates to the social ills in 
her community. At the end, Blaqpearl brings this message home to the audi­
ence with spoken-​word poetry, asking them ‘where are all the Krotoas van van­
dag [today]?’, to which they enthusiastically responded. The audience enjoyed 
the performances very much, with applause lasting for several minutes. As she 
was cheering, the woman sitting next to me was convinced that the play ‘was 
much better than the movie [Krotoa]’.
While Blaqpearl actually shared some of the same motivations for writing 
her play as the people behind the movie Krotoa, Krotoa van vandag was a big­
ger hit among Khoisan revivalists because it overtly endorsed its main tenets 
and ambitions. Contrary to the film, Jan van Riebeeck was only mentioned 
in passing in Krotoa van vandag. The play explicitly focused on the identity 
crisis and the continuities between past and present. It was also written and 
performed by one of their own, which certainly played a role in its positive 
reception. What emerges from these forays into the role of Krotoa in Khoisan 
revivalism is then that the main concern is not so much presenting a picture 
of Krotoa that is as factually accurate as possible but rather one that relates 
Krotoa to present-​day needs. Moreover, these initiatives need to be carried first

and foremost by Khoisan revivalists, ensuring they embody appropriate inter­
pretations of the past. As the fallout from the movie Krotoa or the destruc­
tion of the bench Krotoa’s Place illustrate, those representations of Krotoa that 
steer from the Khoisan revivalist interpretation are not spared criticism. The 
idea that these depictions contribute to a disrespectful view of Khoisan history 
at large is seen as a token of the overall mistreatment of Khoisan revivalists in 
society. Not surprisingly then, when a debate arose over a new name for Cape 
Town International Airport and Krotoa was among the suggestions, Khoisan 
revivalists eagerly participated.
After 1994, ‘Cape Town International Airport’ became a preliminary replace­
ment for ‘d.f. Malan Airport’, after the first apartheid-​era prime minister. 
In March 2018, the Minister of Transport directed Airports Company South 
Africa (acsa) to initiate the process of changing the airport’s name to Nelson 
Mandela International Airport (Vilette 2018). A process of public participa­
tion in order to ponder alternative options was part of this procedure. Julius 
Malema, leader and founder of the opposition party Economic Freedom 
Fighters (eff), felt the airport should instead be renamed after his mentor, 
the anti-​apartheid icon and ex-​wife of Nelson Mandela, Winnie Madikizela-​
Mandela, who had recently passed away. Various politicians opined on the 
issue and other candidates were added to the list, including Robert Subokwe 
and Albertina Sisulu, all of whom Black anti-​apartheid stalwarts. Khoisan 
revivalists put forward Krotoa as their choice on social media. Zenzile Khoisan 
(12/​06/​2018) had little faith in the public participation process but felt par­
tial to both Madikizela-​Mandela and Krotoa. Ultimately it had to be Krotoa, 
however, as she needed to be ‘brought out into the bigger narrative of South 
Africa’. Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras (11/​07/​2018) campaigned stridently for Krotoa 
International Airport, including at the airport itself, but also did not feel the 
public participation process was credible. To her, Krotoa was not seriously up 
for consideration and this was emblematic of the anc’s disregard for the fact 
that the Western Cape province will always be populated for the most part by 
Coloureds (see also Ndletyana 2012, 100–​101). Another interlocutor shared the 
letter she sent to acsa on social media.27 In it, she explains that Krotoa had 
been ‘a peace negotiator during times of war and […] developed the Afrikaans 
language’ through her role as an interpreter. Krotoa had welcomed various 
other nations to South Africa, and her name therefore befitted the airport of 
Cape Town International. The name-​change would also symbolize undoing

the colonial imposition of ‘Eva’ on Krotoa, which she felt presaged the assim­
ilationist processes of apartheid. It ultimately had the potential of fighting 
the identity crisis and the related violent crime on the Cape Flats. Lastly, not 
choosing Krotoa was tantamount to ignoring Coloureds’ claim to the land and 
suppressing Khoisan identity and culture (Tanyan Gradwell, 31/​07/​2019).
Various political actors also opined on the issue. Dawid Kamfer, the 
Provincial chair of the political party Independent Civic Organization of 
South Africa (icosa) stated that Krotoa was the obvious choice as she was not 
a political figure and, unlike Madikizela-​Mandela, had a strong relation to the 
Western Cape province: ‘We can no longer allow the big names in the anc to 
grab all the titles in South Africa’.28 Peter Marais, the ex-​mayor of Cape Town 
and, at the time of writing, representative of the Western Cape for the political 
party Freedom Front+​, campaigned for Krotoa International Airport on social 
media and elsewhere, noting that it would be a great way for people to learn 
about ‘the indigenous people of the Cape and their heroes’.29 Like Kamfer, 
Madikizela-​Mandela was a rather absurd choice for Marais (02/​07/​2018), as 
he did not see how she was connected to the Western Cape. Marais, who was 
always aware of his Griqua roots but has been involved with Khoisan revival­
ism in recent years, explained his views in more detail on his Facebook page:
[I]‌t must be in her name that we welcome visitors from all over the world 
and Africa in particular […] When visiting tourists should ask ‘who was 
Krotoa’? We will be able to tell them with a sense of pride ‘She was the 
kind lady from Africa who welcomed your forefathers to our shores at the 
Cape of Good Hope, who gave them fresh food and water, loved and cared 
for them, sheltered them from the elements, but whose children became 
the slaves of those she treated so well’ […] We have had enough of hon­
ouring politicians who did nothing to improve our lives. It will restore the 
pride in a culture everybody tried to wipe out over centuries.30

Picking up on the heated discussions, acsa vowed to make the public par­
ticipation process ‘as democratic and inclusive as possible’; setting in motion 
an ongoing bureaucratic process that ends with the Minister of Arts and 
Culture making the final decision after receiving a host of recommendations 
from the Geographical Names Council (Grootbek 2018). acsa also organized 
a forum on 4 June 2018, where suggestions for the new name could be put for­
ward (Dano 2018). However, with more than 800 estimated to have attended, 
the meeting descended into chaos as competing factions tried to get their 
point across (February 2018). When a Khoisan revivalist warned of ‘civil war’ if 
Krotoa International Airport would not materialize, the organizers suspended 
the meeting.
The Krotoa International Airport saga illustrates the emotional investment 
that Khoisan revivalists have in Krotoa. It also shows that Khoisan revival­
ism does not occur in a political vacuum. Indeed, politicians of various back­
grounds have claimed a stake in the debate, a topic that falls beyond the scope 
of this book but which I reflect on in the Conclusion. More than politics as 
such, however, the sentiments that are expressed in relation to the name 
change campaign, such as claims to the land and marginalization by the anc, 
reflect the empowerment and entitlement aspects of the Khoisan identity dis­
course. I shift my focus to these features in particular in the next chapter.

The Khoisan Identity Discourse (ii)
Entitlement, Land Claims, and Traditional Leadership
Having seceded from South Africa on the 24th of September 2017, 
The Sovereign State of Good Hope aims to implement a policy of Self 
Determination [sic] […] A wise and compassionate soul, the King 
has clearly and humbly expressed his deep knowledge regarding the 
abundance of human and natural resources within the Sovereign 
State of Good Hope. The King is well aware that these resources 
are currently and historically mismanaged and diverted, resulting 
in as much as half of South Africa’s population living in abject and 
hopeless poverty, in relentless fear for their lives and struggling daily 
with survival under the current political regime. The intention of the 
Sovereign State of Good Hope is to restore the Nation to a state of 
dignity, and send a beacon of hope and opportunity to those who are 
impoverished and suffering; to overhaul the education system in a 
way that teaches compassion, balance and practical life-​skills, whilst 
eradicating the lies, manipulations, fabrications and misrepresenta­
tions from history.

flag of the Sovereign State of Good Hope (ssogh) in their place.1 Accompanied

governmental officials five days to vacate the premises.2 Except for the Khoisan, 
who became citizens automatically, those wishing to remain in the ssogh were 
welcome to apply for citizenship with ‘our government officials’, provided they 
had a valid reason to stay. An ‘Oath of Allegiance’-​form was shared on various 
social media, allowing subjects to swear fealty to their new monarch and rally 
behind him. The young nation’s boundaries mirrored those of the old Cape 
province, encompassing the Western Cape, Northern Cape, and Eastern Cape 
up to the Fish River. Drawing on the undrip and the legal counsel of ‘Law 
Professor Winston P. Nagan, of Gainesville, Florida […] a descendent of the 
Khoisan Nation’, King Cornelius explains in the ssogh manifesto (s.d., 12–​13, 
20) that, having exhausted all other means, secession was the only remaining 
option to stop the government from enacting ‘[c]‌onstitutional failure, lawless­
ness without Justice, hate speech, threats, rapes and xenophobia all targeted 
towards our own people’. The Khoisan had ‘absolute rights and entitlement to 
the land’, and these had been supressed for too long (Naidoo 2019). In the eyes 
of King Cornelius, land expropriation without compensation amounted to an 
illegal transfer of Khoisan land to Blacks. The ssogh website links to various 
documents that further detail its vision.3 It also includes King Cornelius’ family 
tree, reaching all the way back to a certain ‘#Hâb’ in the 17th century (see also 
ssogh s.d., 4). Based on his royal lineage, Cornelius was sworn in as ‘king of 
the nation’ in 2001 at ‘the Last Kraal in Genadendal’.4 He was inducted into the 
cchdc by Joseph Little in the early 2000s, but he soon left to pursue his own 
ambitions, including a provocative claim on the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront 
in 2001, Cape Town’s most visited attraction (Besten 2006, 1; Øvernes 2019, 91). 
As early as 2009, he began to identify as the King of the Royal Khoisan Nation 
(en 2009e, 11), but the ssogh by far landed him the most publicity.
Needless to say, King Cornelius sparked quite a controversy. Among those 
taking him to task was Patrick Tariq Mellet, an anti-​apartheid struggle vet­
eran and heritage expert, who is in many ways supportive of Khoisan reviv­
alists and commands a sizeable following among them or social media. In a 
Facebook post, Mellet dismissed King Cornelius’ claims of royal descent as 
fraudulent, ‘a cut and paste internet job’.5 He also argued that King Cornelius,

who purports to fight for the recognition of all ‘marginalized minority 
groups […] the Eurokaner, Afrikaners and Coloured Nations’ (ssgoh s.d., 
12–​13), struck alliances with (White) right-​wing separatist organizations to 
fund and support his activities (see Conclusion). Mellet (2010, 29) has also 
long decried what he sees as the uncritical borrowing of ‘feudal terminol­
ogy’ from a European context, such as ‘King’, to unscrupulously pursue land 
and financial resources. According to Mellet (16/​03/​2018), such claims traffic 
in distortions of history that are reminiscent of apartheid, particularly the 
assertion ‘full of holes’ that the Khoisan ‘were here first’, have exclusive rights 
to the land, and should sit atop of a reshuffled ‘hierarchy of rights’. The root 
of the problem, in his view, is a lack of historical criticism and interest in 
scrutinizing the original sources: ‘[Some Khoisan revivalists] go through Van 
Riebeeck’s diary and believe as gospel what is written there; they do not read 
the footnotes’.
Mellet regularly broadcasts his take on history via social media and his blog 
about Cape history.6 In 2010, he authored Lenses on Cape Identities: Exploring 
Roots in South Africa, an autobiographical reflection on the various historical 
‘lenses’ through which to conceive of ‘identity’ in the region.7 In Lenses on Cape 
Identities, Mellet argues that everyone is ultimately foreign to South African 
soil and that Cape history is marked by perpetual ethnic fluidity and mixing 
instead of ‘neat boundaries’.8 Cape identity is not about a single indigenous 
lineage but about exceptional degrees of hybridity and multiculturalism (see 
also Ulrich 2015, 38). He even coins an alternative, non-​racial form of identifi­
cation to better capture this: Camissa, after the river that runs beneath Cape 
Town (Mellet 2010, 6). Mellet’s main concern is that Coloureds ‘begin to see 
themselves as African first and foremost’ and do not focus on one lineage, 
which he deems arbitrary (Patrick Mellet, 16/​03/​2018). He acknowledges that 
not all Khoisan revivalists are ‘charlatans’ who overlay their indigeneity with 
race-​based claims (i.e. Coloured identity) (Mellet 2010, 246). Citing among

	7	 In 2020 Mellet published The Lie of 1652: a Decolonized History of Land. While the book stirred 
up a lot of debate, it falls outside the purview of this book as it was published towards the 
end of the writing. However, judging from the reviews, much of the writing is based on earlier 
work, which I incorporate here (Mbao 2020).
	8	 Mellet (2010, 67) highlights several episodes to support his argument, mostly from the 17th 
century. He for example flags instances of intermarriage between Khoisan and amaXhosa. 
He also seeks to counter ‘simplistic claims’ by referencing the fact that Khoisan participated 
in the colonial commando system and that they too migrated to the Cape at some point in 
time (Patrick Mellet, 16/​03/​2018; see Chapter 2).

others Zenzile Khoisan and Yvette Abrahams, Mellet recognizes those who 
revive ‘in a respectful and informed manner, paying due regard to accuracy 
and authenticity as they explore their heritage’. Their Khoisan revivalism, he 
finds, is ‘not adversarial, aggressive or peppered by bizarre claims and actions 
[which] drives people to make boundaries and strive for purity’ (Patrick Mellet, 
16/​03/​2018). For Mellet, certain elements of Khoisan revivalism are a continu­
ation of apartheid-​era efforts to pit Coloureds against Blacks. He also opposes 
a politics of entitlement based on indigeneity, seeing more merit in a contem­
porary needs-​based audit in South Africa. Ultimately then, Mellet would like to 
see Khoisan revivalism more explicitly distance itself from ‘apartheid ‘separate 
development’ ideology and racism’.9
Mellet justifiably emphasizes that claims need to be fact-​checked, particu­
larly if they come at the expense of other South Africans and involve land, tra­
ditional leadership titles, or entitlement in general. This chapter confirms he 
is right to be wary of claims of purity and (race-​based) exclusivity. Like many 
other critics, Mellet primarily views indigeneity-​based entitlement in rela­
tion to (in his case, supposedly historically inaccurate claims of) prior occu­
pancy and essentialism (see Introduction). However, during my fieldwork 
I more frequently encountered indigeneity-​based entitlement claims that 
were not tied to notions of purity, racial exclusion, or an anti-​African agenda. 
Most Khoisan revivalists have for instance joined Mellet in rejecting King 
Cornelius’ endeavours and lineage claims as far back as 2001 (Øvernes 2019, 
91).10 Khoisan revivalists can moreover have multiple motives at the same 
time and make claims literally, symbolically, or hyperbolically depending on 
the setting. Ruben Richards (2017, 107) concluded that, for Khoisan revivalists, 
‘the need to feel that you belong seems to outweigh any other political imper­
ative such as the need to control the political-​economy of the country’. Yet, as 
I show below, aspirations to ‘control the political-​economy’ are not entirely 
alien to the Khoisan identity discourse either. Writing about entitlement in 
Khoisan revivalism thus becomes a difficult task. It is easier to discern what 
it is not about than to distil a definitive list of issues it pertains to –​ not least 
because Khoisan revivalists have no such ‘list’ of detailed demands. In prac­
tice, discourses on empowerment, entitlement, self-​determination, secession,

traditional leadership, and land claims are often entangled. Indigeneity-​based 
entitlement claims are therefore best refracted on a spectrum, ranging from 
radical positions taken up by people like King Cornelius, to less far-​reach­
ing demands and more mundane concerns. The first subchapter shows this 
in relation to emic delineations of Khoisan indigeneity and discourses on 
empowerment and land. The second subchapter extends this discussion to 
traditional leadership claims.
5.1	
Empowerment, Discursive Land Claims, and the Boundaries of 
Khoisan Indigeneity
In order to understand why Khoisan revivalists articulate indigeneity, 
I applied different methods, collected diverse types of data, and came across 
a wide range of answers, which in turn inform the various chapters in this 
text. However, one of the ways I sought to find out what indigeneity meant for 
my interlocutors was to ask them point-​blank. This was my somewhat naive 
way of getting emic definitions of indigeneity. I certainly collected such per­
spectives but, even more so, conversations about indigeneity ended up natu­
rally broaching a swathe of related topics, such as the boundaries of Khoisan 
indigeneity, who might (not) qualify as indigenous, and what all of that meant 
in terms of land ownership, entitlement, and belonging. In this subchapter, 
I give an overview of the contents of these conversations as well as other rele­
vant source material to show how these notions constitute the Khoisan iden­
tity discourse as well.
As I explained in the Introduction, claiming indigeneity is not synonymous 
with demanding a separate state. Some government officials I mentioned in 
Chapter 3 fear this would be the case if the Khoisan are granted indigenous 
status, but hardly any of the Khoisan revivalists I interacted with wished to 
secede. Lesle Jansen is the daughter of a prominent Khoisan revivalist and 
a lawyer working with the ngo Natural Justice, which provides legal assis­
tance to the nkc. In an article for enn (2016b, 7), she emphasized that the 
South African state should not fear secessionist aspirations if they recognize 
Khoisan indigeneity, as international legal instruments on indigenous rights 
exclude secession from the right to self-​determination. As exemplified by the 
lack of support for King Cornelius and his ssogh, only a tiny fraction of the 
Khoisan revivalists I came across actually desired this (cf. Besten 2009, 147). 
Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras does not want a separate Khoisan state but instead 
desires ‘self-​determination’: a way to live within the South African state on 
different terms, freed from top-​down pressures to compromise her ‘true

identity’ and assimilate (enn 2013a, 9). Zenzile Khoisan (24/​05/​2018) also 
made a point of stressing how his indigeneity ‘has nothing to do with sub­
verting the Constitution’. Chantal Revell too stressed that she is not out to 
secure ‘superior treatment or want[s]‌ to be treated as a superior Nation’ but 
only asks for recognition of the Khoisan’s specific historical trajectory and 
contemporary needs (enn 2017a, 13). For many, an official acknowledgement 
of Khoisan indigeneity in this fashion would already go a long way (see e.g. 
Chantal Revell, 07/​01/​2014; Zenzile Khoisan, 17/​05/​2018; Joseph Little, 08/​05/​
2018). This might explain the recurrent demand to have Khoisan identity rec­
ognized on South African passports and in the census (see e.g. enn 2014a, 4; 
2014i, 5; 2014g, 14; 2014k, 4).
The vast majority of my interlocutors also did not leverage Khoisan indige­
neity to exclude other groups from South African society or to deny them their 
rights or historical roots. Chizuko Sato (2018, 209) argues that some identify as 
‘first indigenous’ because a ratified ilo 169 –​ which defines everybody present 
in an area at the time of colonialism as indigenous (see Chapter 3) –​ would ren­
der all African groups ‘indigenous’ to South Africa. However, in my experience, 
expressions of Khoisan identity were not tailored to better fit international law 
or to one-​up others. The argument that emerged during my fieldwork was not 
so much that ‘everyone is indigenous, but some are more indigenous than oth­
ers’, but rather that Khoisan indigeneity has a distinctive meaning that only 
partially relates to notions of prior occupancy. Aaron Messelaar (16/​03/​2018) 
believes that if you are born in South Africa, you are indigenous. The Khoisan 
are the ‘first indigenous nation of South Africa’, but that does not give rise to 
special rights but to ‘equal rights’, an equal recognition of their identity and 
culture. Priscilla De Wet similarly uses the term ‘First Nation’ (or ‘First Nation 
Indigenous’) to set the Khoisan, ‘the first inhabitants of South Africa’, apart 
from Blacks, who she also considers ‘indigenous’ (De Wet 2010b, 6, 30). This 
distinction is meant to assist the pursuit of ‘equality and restitution of jus­
tice from the nation state’, not to chase people away (ibid., 6). Mackie (16/​17/​
2018; see below) believes that all Africans are indigenous to the African conti­
nent but that the Khoisan are ‘aboriginal’ to parts of it, which does not grant 
them ‘more rights’ but necessitates a historical scope that reaches beyond 
apartheid: ‘they are fellow Africans […] we are not anti-​people, we are anti-​
ignorance, anti-​racism’. Jansen also stressed that ‘[t]‌here is no question that 
all Africans are indigenous to Africa in the sense that they were there before 
the European colonialists arrived and that they were subject to subordination 
during colonialism’ (enn 2016b, 7). The Khoisan, she argues, use indigeneity in 
the ‘modern analytical form […] to draw attention to and alleviate the particu­
lar form of discrimination from which they suffer. They do not use the term in

order to deny all other Africans their legitimate claim to belong to Africa and 
identify as such’.11
Just as Khoisan revivalists in the main do not articulate indigeneity to deny 
others their belonging or even their ‘indigeneity’, they are also not attempting 
to recycle apartheid-​era Coloured nationalism in an effort to distance them­
selves from their African roots. In fact, as I detailed in Chapter 3, people like 
Mackie and Zenzile Khoisan became involved with Khoisan revivalism in part 
to counter their supposed lack of African roots. Claiming a Khoisan identity is 
indeed often hailed as the ultimate assertion of African belonging and there­
fore the strongest counter to common sentiments that ‘the Western Cape is not 
really African’ (Cruywagen 2019). For Nolan Berry (18/​12/​2018), who I return 
to in the next chapter, ‘history is like a puzzle you have to put together’, and 
he realizes he chose to emphasize Khoisan ancestry because ‘the government’ 
refused to see him as an African like any other. If things had turned out dif­
ferently, he might ‘not have considered reviving the Khoisan’. De Wet (2011, 
101) also explained that an encounter in Mozambique where someone referred 
to her as a ‘mulata [mixed-​race person]’ led her to assert her ‘KhoeSan iden­
tity’ and join ‘the KhoeSan movement’s quest for the restoration of their right­
ful place as full citizens in the ‘new’ South African and its history’. Identifying 
as Khoisan made De Wet take pride in her ‘African hair and features. I finally 
know who I am, where I belong, and exercise my right to self-​identification and 
identify with my African ancestors, the KhoeSan people’.
One has to take care here not to confuse the term Black, in its South African 
context, with exclusive access to African roots. Whereas Khoisan revivalists 
proudly feel African, and thereby reflect the influence of Black Consciousness 
and Pan-​Africanist thinking, their relationship with Blacks and with the term 
Black is more complex (see also Brown and Deumert 2017, 574). Pumla Dineo 
Gqola (2010, 46) argues that the !Hurikamma Cultural Movement, which I dis­
cussed in Chapter 2, embodied ‘a redefinition of how to inhabit Blackness in 
a post-​apartheid South Africa: by identifying as b/​Black, African, Brown and 
Khoi all at the same time’. In her reading, identifying as Khoisan ‘challenges the 
narrowness of conservative definitions […] It works also as an alternative to 
“coloured” because it chooses an indigenous African trajectory of naming over 
a colonially imposed one’ (ibid., 52). While I have not encountered Khoisan 
revivalists who simultaneously and explicitly embrace various labels in the way 
Gqola discerned (though, to my regret, I did not ask them about this directly

These interpretations of Khoisan indigeneity closely resemble the South African govern­
ments’ ‘vulnerable indigenous people’ argument I laid out in Chapter 3. I reflect at greater 
length on the similarities and differences in the Conclusion.

either), Khoisan revivalism certainly amounts to a belated ‘Africanization’ 
of Coloured identity but not as Black, which most Khoisan revivalists deem 
meaningless and politically ineffective. For Mackie (02/​07/​2018), the prob­
lem is that Black in the post-​apartheid era came to exlusively denote African 
belonging, thereby foreclosing his ability to identify as African: ‘Black was sup­
posed to bring us together, but it is not working […] it does not explore the 
depth of colonialism’. Growing up in a family of staunch pan-​Africanists, Basil 
Coetzee (06/​05/​2018) similarly endorsed the ideas of the Black Consciousness 
Movement early on, apart from its emphasis on the label ‘Black’, ‘a European 
colonial construct’ he is dead set against (see Chapter 2). The word ‘Native’ was 
‘corrupted’ to mean ‘Black’ as they ‘are not native to South Africa. Africa, yes, of 
course, but not South Africa’ (Basil Coetzee, 12/​05/​2018). ‘Coloureds’ were not 
thought of as indigenous ‘because it was said they came about as a result of 
Black and White coming together. Because of history books we never viewed 
ourselves as natives or indigenous’. Coetzee (25/​04/​2018, see below) empha­
sized that ‘this is not to say they have no place here […] or not belong here’, just 
like Whites or other groups: ‘the amaXhosa have a large degree of Khoi dna 
[…] we share the clicks and so forth so they are not our enemies’. Ultimately, 
he wants to see ‘race’ abandoned in the post-​apartheid era: ‘It’s about historical 
rights, self-​determination and recognition […] We are not the passengers in 
the bus here and [others] the drivers, we should be the drivers as well’. In an 
article for Eland Nuus, an irasa spokesperson similarly argued that race was 
an invention and therefore not an appropriate concept ‘within a true democ­
racy’ (en 2012e, 9). The continued use of race in post-​apartheid society only 
worked to further ‘subjugate and dehumanise the KhoiSan’.
Then again, as I noted at the beginning of Chapter 4, Khoisan revivalism 
is articulated in relation to Coloured identity and therefore inescapably func­
tions in large part as a vessel to express ‘Coloured grievances’. Conversations 
on indigeneity naturally drifted towards issues related to their ongoing racial 
categorization as Coloured as a result. In this regard, Khoisan revivalists 
often speak of the need to ameliorate the living conditions of ‘our people’, yet 
who are they referring to? Some certainly seem to consider all Coloureds as 
Khoisan, as an enn contributor did when he put the number of Khoisan in 
South Africa at 8.5 million, roughly the number of Coloureds in the country 
in 2013 (enn 2014h, 10). Critics such as Richard van der Ross (2015, 22) have 
debunked such statements by pointing out that not just the Khoisan were 
categorized as Coloured but various other groups as well, including from out­
side the continent. The flipside of the argument could also be used to counter 
the same statement: Khoisan ancestry is found among various population 
groups, not just Coloureds. Most Khoisan revivalists do not deny the multiple

lineages that make up Coloured identity, nor do they simply equate the two 
(see below). Their view is rather that all Khoisan were labelled Coloured but 
that not all Coloureds are necessarily Khoisan. This still does not resolve the 
question of what then makes someone ‘Khoisan’. As I show below, the answer 
is intriguingly complex. Conversations where I probed the supposed boundar­
ies of Khoisan identity were difficult to navigate, as it might have felt at times 
as if I was trying to ‘expose’ people’s identities. While there are seemingly end­
less interpretations of who counts as Khoisan and who does not, particularly 
when discussed in relation to claims of traditional leadership (see below), two 
common, but non-​mutually-​exclusive or definitive, elements surfaced during 
interviews: a show of dedication to revive Khoisan identity and a credible 
claim to the experience of being known as Coloured (i.e. the identity crisis; see 
Chapter 4).
For Mackie (02/​07/​2018; see below), who prefers ‘aboriginal’ to ‘indigenous’ 
because it denotes a presence as far as time stretches back, ‘everybody has 
the genetic makeup of Khoisan’, so the relevant question is ‘what were you 
before?’. If prior to embracing Khoisan identity, one has enjoyed certain priv­
ileges associated with another label, including Coloured, one has to renounce 
these. The longer one identifies as Khoisan, the longer one can ‘cultivate that 
spiritual relationship to the land [which] counts for something’ (Mackie, 05/​
07/​2018). Indeed, in Mackie’s view, those ‘arriving late to the Khoisan strug­
gle’ should have to account for why it took them so long. The test, in Mackie’s 
view, is therefore ‘not based on looks or tribal affiliation’ but on a combina­
tion of dedication to Khoisan revivalism and a rejection of Coloured identity. 
William Langeveldt (12/​03/​2018; 27/​03/​2018) suggests a ‘verification process’ to 
check whether people ‘truly come from the areas they said they come from’ to 
ensure they are not identifying as Khoisan for ulterior motives. Another inter­
locutor likewise did not exclude anyone from claiming Khoisan identity on 
biological terms but demands an explanation from non-​Coloureds why they 
did not identify as Khoisan sooner (Tanyan Gradwell, 31/​07/​2019). Growing up 
with another racial label meant a person did not undergo the same history 
of discrimination, potentially accessed certain benefits, and knew ‘who they 
were for centuries’, that is, they did not have to sruggle with an identity crisis. 
Zenzile (24/​05/​2018) put forward a similar view as he described indigeneity as 
being ‘aligned with your foundational being […] Asserting who you are beyond 
anybody’s control’. According to Zenzile, competition over resources however 
gives rise to all manner of ill-​conceived boundaries of Khoisan identity. Proving 
a single link to the Khoisan within one’s family tree suffices to be seen as a 
‘descendant’ –​ a point also made by Joseph Little (08/​05/​2018), who sees this 
as enough of a ‘link’ to claim indigeneity and ‘indigenous rights’. At the same

time, Zenzile (24/​05/​2018) believes that Khoisan revivalists should also ‘asso­
ciate themselves with, and actively practice, the lost culture […] they should 
live out the revival and set right what was destroyed’. When I asked Zenzile if 
this meant Whites could also qualify, this was fine provided they ‘apologize’ 
for being part of an oppressive system and explain why they did not distance 
themselves from it earlier: ‘If you have not witnessed a history of oppression, 
this renders you way down the line in terms of entitlement to indigeneity’.
The link between Khoisan identity and the experience of being known as 
Coloured (under apartheid) is constantly affirmed –​ but not necessarily as an 
absolute criterion. Intuitively, Khoisan revivalists seem to relate to the same 
kind of experiences in this regard and accept one another based on a shared 
understanding, organically giving rise to somewhat of a Khoisan revivalist 
‘imagined community’ (Anderson 1991, 6). In this sense, Khoisan revivalists 
are inclusive of people of various backgrounds, race, and creeds –​ a point 
also observed by the sahrc in its report on Khoisan marginalization (sahrc 
2018, 50). At the same time, the ‘Coloured experience’ seems enshrined in the 
Khoisan identity discourse, which includes the commonly held sentiment that 
those labelled Coloured are woefully ignored by the anc government. There is 
a strong sense among Coloureds in general that Whites control the economy 
and Blacks the political sphere, leaving them to fall by the wayside (Adhikari 
2004, 173). One interlocutor even spoke of being marginalized by a form of 
‘Black majoritarianism, Black apartheid’ (Joe Damons, 16/​07/​2018). anc offi­
cials have on occasion certainly expressed sentiments that seem to suggest 
that Coloureds ought to fall in line with a Black-​African agenda, for instance 
by pursuing a strategy of deriding any embrace of Coloured identity as anti-​
African (see e.g. Farred 2000, 56). For some Khoisan revivalists, their marginal­
ization is part of a larger design to oppress Coloureds, and multiple examples 
are cited to prove their point, as I show in the remainder of this subchapter.
One example that is sometimes cited is the purported lack of recognition 
and overall mistreatment of veterans from the Suid Afrikaanse Kleurling Korps 
(sakk) [Cape Coloured Corps (sacc)] –​ the previous Coloured branch of the 
apartheid army –​ some of whom have become involved in Khoisan revivalism, 
such as Basil Coetzee (06/​05/​2018; see also enn 2013a, 8; Messelaar 2015, 61). 
According to Zenzile Khoisan (07/​05/​2018), the fact that soldiers in the sakk, 
many of whom joined to escape poverty, were dismissed after 1994 instead of 
being integrated into the reformed defence force like other contingents shows 
that the anc considers them ‘traitors’. As the sahrc report on Khoisan mar­
ginalization (2018, 75) notes, this meant among other things that sakk veter­
ans could not access the same retirement benefits as other personnel. Some 
veterans caused a controversy by reportedly establishing a ‘Khoisan Nation

Self Defence Unit’, threatening to use violence against ‘South Africa’s black 
colonial government’ if they were not taken seriously and ‘ancestral land’ was 
not returned (Secorun 2018). The same source claims the Unit is a few hun­
dred strong, but none of my interlocutors ever mentioned them. Be that as it 
may, the sakk was certainly frequently referred to in general terms as a sign 
of Khoisan marginalization. For Mellet (16/​03/​2018), this is proof that many 
Khoisan revivalists essentially endorse racial segregation. I have not done 
enough research among ex-​sakk members by far to make an assessment in 
this regard. In the context of my ma, I did attend a ‘wreath laying ceremony 
for the fallen Khoisan soldiers throughout history’, organized by irasa at the 
sakk’s recreational centre in Athlone (Verbuyst 2015, 90–​91). I describe the 
ceremony in more detail in my ma thesis, but it essentially drew a historical 
parallel between the sakk and Khoisan resistance to colonialism to showcase 
their ongoing marginalization by the post-​apartheid government. The link 
between Khoisan revivalism and the sakk certainly deserves further scrutiny, 
but it did not play a major role during my fieldwork.
Much more prevalent were grievances related to affirmative action poli­
cies and immigration to Cape Town. People have been moving to Cape Town 
for decades, predominantly from the Eastern Cape (Western 2001, 635). Fear 
for the effects of this movement of people was part of the apartheid regime’s 
warning of the so-​called swart gevaar [black danger], which was used to whip 
up support among Whites and Coloureds who were eager to safeguard their 
positions of relative privilege (Posel 2001, 98). People however never stopped 
moving to Cape Town, and Coloureds were no longer the absolute majority 
demographic in the Cape Peninsula by 1985 (Van Kessel 2000, 228). Migration 
picked up speed after apartheid, causing the city’s population to expand rap­
idly and informal settlements to mushroom across the Cape Flats and the 
Northern Suburbs (Comaroff and Comaroff 2001, 642; Western 2001, 627; 
Mosselson 2010). Till this day, the economic and cultural impact of immigra­
tion remains a hotly contested issue in the Western Cape. Crudely put, the 
migration of Blacks to areas with great concentrations of Coloureds is seen by 
some as an unwelcome development because it reduces the latter’s employ­
ment chances and their access to housing –​ objections that are often formu­
lated in the same breath (Stevens 1998, 209). For Basil Coetzee (12/​05/​2018), 
unchecked immigration is part of the state-​sanctioned ‘forced integration and 
assimilation’ of Coloureds, which also includes turning a blind eye to crime 
and violence. He also feels unfair positive discrimination policies (see below) 
are allowing Blacks to skip ahead of others in the cue for social housing: ‘If I go 
to Port Elizabeth [in the Eastern Cape] I would not get ahead’ (Basil Coetzee, 
06/​05/​2018). Another interlocutor felt ‘ring-​fenced’ by Black squatter camps,

which according to him drastically reduced the number of opportunities for 
Coloureds by design (Mackie, 16/​17/​2018). Another contribution in enn sim­
ilarly sensed that
our living space is taken over by African Nationals and the anc encour­
ages blacks to ‘take their province back’ […] The more coloureds that 
are drugged and killing each other, the more space for blacks! We only 
become a minority since the blacks arrived! Check your history books, 
not the anc history books, but the real history that goes back to 1652, and 
then you will see things for what they are.
enn 2013f, 7
Despite the overtly racialized nature of these types of complaints, one of my 
interlocutors, Tanyan Gradwell (31/​07/​2019), insisted that it is not racist to 
oppose ‘this influx of people’ as it results in the further marginalization of 
the Khoisan. Zenzile Khoisan (07/​05/​2018) explained to me in an interview 
that he feels compassion for those migrating from the Eastern Cape as ‘they 
too are disappointed in failures of leadership’. However, he also recognized it 
gave rise to frustrations (‘a feeling of suffocation’) among Coloureds, partic­
ularly in the job market. Affirmative action policies, in place since 2003 and 
known as Broad-​Based Black Economic Empowerment (bbbee) since 2008, 
strive to undo apartheid-​era discrimination by requiring companies to employ 
a certain percentage of non-​White staff and provide programs to develop their 
skills and careers (Knight 2014, 29). Coloureds benefit as well from bbbee, but 
many interlocutors complained they do so to a far lesser degree than Blacks. 
Zenzile (07/​05/​2018) argues that the problem in the Western Cape is that the 
national equity criteria on which the policies are based are out of sync with the 
demographic make-​up of the province, where Coloureds constitute the larg­
est population group. There is a strong sense among Khoisan revivalists (and 
others) that Blacks are therefore disproportionally advantaged.12 According to 
William Langeveldt (2016, 85), bbbee is racist because it forces the Khoisan 
to identify as Coloured in order to benefit. Interlocutors regularly complained 
	12	
Affirmative action policies remain shrouded in controversy. In 2020, Glen Snyman, a 
Coloured schoolteacher identified as ‘African’ on a job application, which some saw as a 
fraudulent claim, intent on getting ahead of disadvantaged groups (‘Glen Snyman: South 
African accused of fraud for saying he’s ‘African’.’ bbc News (2020) https://​www.bbc.com/​
news/​world-​afr​ica-​54531​457, accessed 20 March 2021). Snyman defended his choice by 
stating that he was ‘first and foremost’ South African. I have not been able to locate any 
studies that examine the diverging impact of bbbee on Coloureds vis-​à-​vis Blacks.

that they or their relatives and friends could not find a job because of bbbee. 
Editions of enn also feature testimonials from people who are fed up with 
affirmative action (see e.g. enn 2013b, 5). One respondent for instance com­
plained that ‘Foundation Nation applicants are discouraged to apply for posi­
tions, even though they have the necessary skills, experience and expertise. 
They are told straight don’t apply because a black person must be appointed’ 
(enn 2013f, 7). This exacerbates the already high unemployment figures, which 
in turn worsens the identity crisis (enn 2014k, 3). Affirmative action as such 
is not always opposed, but it would have to include the Khoisan in a more 
meaningful way (enn 2014e, 10). As Tanyan Gradwell put it: ‘We want people 
to get involved in running the businesses and owning them’ (Tanyan Gradwell, 
31/​07/​2019). Though it is not clear what this entails in practice, some compa­
nies have begun to explicitly support Khoisan revivalism by advertising in enn 
as law firms that are sympathetic to the cause (enn 2014a, 7), a ‘trotse eerste 
nasie maatskappy [proud first nation business]’ specialized in electricity and 
lighting services (enn 2013a, 3), or ‘Eerste Nasie finansiele dienste [First Nation 
financial services]’ providing insurance policies (enn, 2016a, 5).
As I noted in Chapter 3, mounting frustrations have made indigeneity an 
increasingly popular and volatile form or leverage to accentuate grievances 
that are traditionally related to the experience of being known as Coloured. 
One episode from my fieldwork stands out. It relates to the social movement 
G@tvol Capetonian [fed-​up Cape Town citizens], which was set up in 2017 by 
three well-​known activists in Mitchells Plain and campaigns around socio­
economic issues affecting Coloureds, such as housing and organised crime. 
G@tvol Capetonian was founded just days before violent conflicts broke out 
as residents from Siqalo, a predominantly Black informal settlement lacking 
basic infrastructure, began protesting and destroying property in adjacent 
Mitchells Plain (Jacobs and Levenson 2018). Fadiel Adams, one of the leaders 
of G@tvol Capetonian, confronted the protestors from Siqalo and threatened 
to retaliate together with other disgruntled residents. He felt Blacks should 
not protest about housing because Coloureds ‘had been here since before 
the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck’ and welcomed everyone else in, unlike Blacks 
who ‘don’t want to share; they want it all’ (Pather and Whittles 2018). Adams 
complained about ‘people from the Eastern Cape’ avowedly unjustly skipping 
the cue on waiting lists for social housing (see above). He refused to ‘shut up 
and sit down’ and vowed to get as ‘physical’ as the government in its ‘hous­
ing, employment and economic war’. G@tvol Capetonian has reportedly orga­
nized numerous land occupations of their own in response, setting up illegal 
structures on vacant land across Cape Town. The organization demands better 
housing conditions and social services but also openly flirts with the idea of

The Khoisan Identity Discourse (ii)

an independent state, ‘where we don’t have racism [and] there will never be a 
hungry person’ (Kamaldien 2018). Some commentators have argued that G@
tvol Capetonian’s politics are an incarnation of the anti-​Black Coloured nation­
alism of apartheid, as evidenced for instance by its alleged ties to the Cape 
Party, a small-​scale White-​dominated political party that advocates for a sepa­
rate state (Jacobs and Levenson 2018; see Conclusion).
The reference to the Khoisan is certainly new in Coloured nationalism, 
which brings me to the fieldwork event I want to share: a meeting called by G@
tvol Capetonian on 30 July 2018 in Beacon Hill High School in Mitchells Plain. 
The gathering was billed as a ‘Call for unity’, a brainstorm session about how to 
best organize Coloureds to increase their political leverage. Though not adver­
tised as a meeting about Khoisan issues specifically, a Khoisan revivalist stood 
at the entrance of the hall chanting and burning incense. I also estimate that 
two thirds of the roughly 200 people who turned up were Khoisan revivalists 
because Khoisan issues were brought up at a every turn, not just during the 
‘Special Announcement –​ Promoting Khoisan Culture, Issues and Plight’, as 
listed on the programme. The dynamics of the meeting functioned somewhat 
like an echo chamber. Various activists and representatives of organizations 
attending the meeting delivered impromptu speeches about Khoisan indige­
neity being the last frontier against land expropriation without compensation 
and that their identity as indigenous people needed to be recognized urgently. 
One speaker received cheers when he pretended to spit on the floor while 
rejecting Coloured identity and stating that ‘our nationhood was taken from 
us with Jan van Riebeeck, yet we are still here […] We survived apartheid, we 
survived colonialism and we will survive this as well’. Like other speakers, he 
felt that his ‘dignity’ had been stepped on. A G@tvol Capetonian spokesper­
son joined him in embracing his Khoisan roots: ‘We are Khoisan people. We 
are here and we are staying here. We are ready to take back what rightfully 
belongs to us […] They all found us here and raped and murdered us’. Mackie 
was also present in his animal skins and exclaimed ‘we are not poor, we are 
dispossessed. The Khoisan are not poor, the Coloureds are poor!’. Now more 
than ever, it was argued, the government pursued divide-​and-​rule tactics. 
Increased protest, activism, and subversion of the state were the appropriate 
response. All of this was met with applause, although the meeting ended with­
out a specific plan on how to move forward. Additional research is necessary to 
ascertain whether these types of meetings are representative of the increased 
salience of Khoisan issues within Coloured identity politics.
The G@tvol Capetonian meeting did however clearly evidence the increased 
appeal of Khoisan indigeneity in debates regarding land, as I already noted 
in Chapter 3. And yet, as with so much else related to Khoisan revivalism, the

Chapter 5
discourse on land is characterized by a wide range of positions. On the one 
hand, blanket statements such as those made during the G@tvol Capetonian 
meeting that ‘all of South Africa’ belongs to the Khoisan as they ‘were there first’ 
are frequently voiced, both privately and publicly (cf. Sato 2018, 207). William 
Langeveldt (12/​03/​2018) maintains that ‘the [old] Cape Colony, all of Namibia, 
as well as the western half of Botswana are Khoi territories’. For Joseph Little 
(08/​05/​2018), the matter was quite straightforward as well, the Khoisan had 
the oldest presence in Southern Africa and ‘everyone else founds us here’. An 
irasa manifesto from 2012 similarly argued that ‘South Africa is founded on 
stolen land, the descendants of the invaders are squatting on KhoiSan land, our 
association with our ancestral land was disrupted by colonial invasion’ (irasa 
2012, 47). For Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras (03/​01/​2015), charging Khoisan reviv­
alists with illegal ‘occupations’ is therefore nonsensical: ‘how do you occupy 
what belongs to you?’. A contributor in enn similarly insisted that all existing 
title deeds are null and void, since he inherited ‘elke sentimeter [every centi­
metre]’ of Southern Africa by birth right (enn 2014i, 5). It is common when 
making these sort of abstract claims to leverage rock art as a type of title deed, 
an analogy also made by others as far back as the early 20th century (Deacon 
1997, 28; Prins 1998, 112; Morris 2014, 656). Joseph Little (08/​05/​2018) argued 
that the spread of rock art paintings across Southern Africa is proof that the 
land does not belong to Blacks. Tanyan Gradwell (31/​07/​2019) too reasoned 
that ‘we have rock art all over, we own those countries’. Cecil Le Fleur made 
a reference to rock art in the same vein when he addressed President Cyril 
Ramaphosa during the opening of the House of Traditional Leaders in 2018:
If you visit the mountains, valleys and riverbeds of our beautiful country 
Mr president, you will see the ancient title deeds of our ancestral lands 
beautifully painted on the walls of the caves and grafted on the faces of 
the rocks in the valleys. These almost holy places of heritage survived 
through thousands and in some cases for hundreds of thousands of years 
to be used by us today as testimonies to our claims for land in the country 
of our origin.

Interpreted in this way, rock art serves as the ultimate marker of indigeneity; it 
cuts across the bureaucratic red tape in the land restitution process –​ princi­
pally the need for a written title-​deed and the dispossession to have occurred 
after 1913 –​ and leapfrogs centuries of dispossession and dislocation. Rock art is 
moreover historically related to Khoisan spirituality and embedded in the rela­
tionship Khoisan revivalists cultivate with land more generally. The inability to

access rock art sites that are located on farms is a common complaint (see e.g. 
enn 2014h, 2). irasa (2012, 47), and others flagged their inability to relate ‘spir­
itually’ to ‘holy sites and sites of remembrance’ in general. For Vanessa Ludwig 
(19/​08/​2019), Khoisan revivalism is about ‘heritage, rootedness, ancestry […] 
the bones of my ancestors are in a specific piece of territory […] I want to be 
able to go there and have the right to carry out my rites, I am not saying I need 
to live there or own it, but it has to be recognized that I have that connection’. 
Ownership is indeed also a contested subject in Khoisan revivalist circles. For 
Zenzile Khoisan (24/​05/​2018), ‘ownership is a complete contradiction of indi­
geneity, it taps into a vertical hierarchical concept of society. Indigeneity has 
nothing to do with kicking people out’. Willa Boezak (03/​05/​2018) too believes 
Eurocentric views on land ‘completely clashed with the worldview of indige­
nous people, who had a spiritual relationship with the land’. Land reform, in his 
view, however, needs to address real material concerns by taking into account 
‘economic realities’. What this means for Khoisan revivalists is not clear, not 
least because policy proposals in this regard have been highly ambiguous 
(see Chapter 3). None of my interlocutors however wanted to evict present-​
day occupants. Joseph Little (08/​05/​2018) clarified that he does not want to 
‘chase people away’ as they too have contributed to South African society. He 
does believe that ‘the base’ should be owned by the Khoisan;, the rest can be 
negotiated. Others too have demanded a bigger share of South Africa’s min­
eral wealth, possibly through royalties, in reference to past and present mining 
operations located on historical Khoisan territory (enn 2017b, 5). Basil Coetzee 
(12/​05/​2018) made a similar observation, stating that he had no interest in 
farming himself but that more Khoi should have ownership of those farms and 
enjoy part of the profits.
In line with my earlier findings about entitlement more broadly, despite 
their diversity, claims to land are on the whole clearly not intent on dispos­
sessing others. Khoisan revivalist land claims are certainly rooted in pragmatic 
concerns, as evidenced by the Siqalo protests surrounding housing or the vari­
ous statements I referenced, but they are simultaneously pegged on issues that 
I described somewhat casually as ‘symbolic’ in my ma thesis. As I explained 
in the Introduction, I surveyed a series of sites in and around Cape Town to 
understand why and how Khoisan revivalists were claiming ‘land’ (Verbuyst 
2015, 63–​116). Back then and now, I hardly ever encountered people who were 
trying to claim back specific plots of land because they or their families were 
historically dispossessed, as is generally the case with land restitution in South 
Africa. Instead, claims were mostly abstract and collective in nature, some­
times related to specific sites, but most often expressed through the blanket 
statements I discussed above. ‘Land’ functioned mostly as a metaphor for their

exclusion, not so much as specific physical spaces (cf. Verbuyst 2016). The dis­
course on land thus acted as a way of expressing grievances regarding ‘Coloured 
identity, history and healing’, as I put it in 2016. Revisiting this assessment in 
light of later findings I would perhaps speak instead of ‘discursive land claims’ 
to highlight their embeddedness in the Khoisan identity discourse, particu­
larly the various aspects related to entitlement I discussed above. In this sense, 
land remains a gateway issue, connected to various other concerns of Khoisan 
revivalists (cf. Van Wyk 2014, 25). Interestingly, Cherryl Walker came to some­
what of a similar realization when reflecting on pre-​1913 land claims in general:
It is not so much that these claimants believe that we should be dealing 
with the dispossessions of the colonial past. It is rather that many of them 
do not place the colonial period in a distant, previously experienced but 
now concluded past –​ they present historical personalities and events 
almost as if they are still alive, operating in some sort of meta-​present. 
In these popular histories, historical figures […] are active and meaning­
ful contemporary reference points. At times the evidence can be woven 
together into the most exhilarating collage, in which time and causality 
are completely subordinated to the requirements of the claimant’s per­
sonal, current quest.
walker 2000, 5
As I noted in the previous chapter, historical continuities are at the core of 
Khoisan revivalists’ engagements with the past and are indeed reflected in 
their discourse on land, which I revisit at some length in the Conclusion. 
Highlighting both the historical and current Khoisan presence in Cape Town 
is key for Khoisan revivalists, not only to deepen their belonging but also to 
counter the Khoisan extinction discourse and address the colonial charac­
ter of the city (see also Bam-​Hutchison 2016, 19). This presence is asserted in 
relation to iconic places in Cape Town, as well as in more general terms. As 
I showed in Chapter 3, a seminal event in 2012 aimed to restore the ‘indigenous 
name’ of the city itself, //​Hui !Gaeb. It is common to speak of !Huri#oaxa or 
‘Hoerikwaggo’ instead of Table Mountain in Khoisan revivalist circles for sim­
ilar reasons. Robben Island too, is frequently linked to Autshumato more so 
than Nelson Mandela, arguably its most famous prisoner. A contemporary pic­
ture of Robben Island for instance circulated on social media with the caption 
‘Autshumato Island’. In his poem Robben Island, Basil Coetzee (2019a, 27) too 
seeks to restore the often forgotten associations of the island with Khoi his­
torical figures such as Krotoa, Stuurman, or Autshumato. Driving around with 
Coetzee, he often regretted that streets and areas were often given nonsensical

or offensive names: ‘All the streets are named after White artists, politicians and 
poets of the apartheid-​era. They tells us nothing about ourselves […] We have 
thousands of poets, where are they? They are nowhere, they are not honoured’ 
(Basil Coetzee, 06/​05/​2018).13 As I mentioned at various points, Khoisan reviv­
alists have already begun making both physical and symbolic interventions in 
this regard, ranging from erecting small commemorative signs at meaningful 
locations in Cape Town, to calling for the city and its airport’s name to reflect 
their presence. In closing, I want to reiterate that the notion of ‘discursive land 
claims’ in no way negates the material concerns of the land debate. Nor does 
it foreclose Khoisan revivalists’ desire to claim ownership of specific sites that 
are meaningful to them. It is also not a reflection of what Khoisan revivalists 
necessarily desire as an outcome in the ongoing policy negotiations regard­
ing pre-​1913 land restitution. More research is necessary to audit their current 
views on land, which are no doubt diverse. What my subchapter does argue 
for, however, is that the discourse on land needs to be seen as part of a wider 
Khoisan identity discourse. As I show next, I make a somewhat similar obser­
vation with regards to another core feature of Khoisan politics: traditional 
leadership.
5.2	
On Khoisan Revivalist Traditional Leadership
Reflecting on the fieldwork I carried out during my ma research, I noted in 
2015 how I was struck by the amount of ‘kings and chiefs’ I had met along the 
way (Verbuyst 2015, 12). My subsequent visits to the field were equally filled 
with encounters with Khoisan traditional leaders with various titles and ambi­
tions. As I noted in the Introduction, most of the media coverage of Khoisan 
revivalism centres on this issue as well, particularly if it involves controversial 
claims like those of King Cornelius. Traditional leadership has never been the 
focus of my research, in the sense of honing in on a specific set of Khoisan tra­
ditional leaders and scrutinizing in detail what the institution meant to them. 
I welcome this kind of research, however, as it would generate ethnographic 
data that might fine-​tune, challenge, or invalidate some of the views I present 
below. My thoughts on the topic are indeed provisional and drawn mostly from 
indirect engagements with a number of Khoisan traditional leaders and their 
	13	
It should be noted that things in this regard are slowly changing. Cape Town is for instance 
home to a ‘Dawid Kruiper bridge’ since 2015 (see ‘Cape Town footbrigdes to be named 
after SA legends.’ News24 (2015) https://​www.new​s24.com/​new​s24/​tra​vel/​cape-​town-​foot​

organizations, rather than a sustained analytical enquiry based on an exten­
sive data set. I did attempt to work more closely with some Khoisan traditional 
leaders and their organizations at various points during my fieldwork. For rea­
sons that I can only speculate on –​ except for one occasion, where I was denied 
access because I refused to pay for the privilege (see Chapter 1) –​ my attempts 
were largely fruitless. Based on informal conversations, I suspect the people 
in question might have feared that I was out to ‘expose’ the ‘inauthenticity’ of 
their claims. After all, as I explained in Chapter 3 with regards to the Traditional 
and Khoi-​San Leadership Act (tkla), certain Khoisan revivalists have been 
anticipating the official recognition of Khoisan traditional leadership organi­
zations and the accompanying privileges and benefits for years. Having a criti­
cal researcher poke around might seem detrimental to their efforts. Skepticism 
of my ‘true’ motives might explain why my questions about topics such as 
membership figures, lineage, or funding were frequently dodged, or why my 
overall attempts to find out more were stonewalled. Perhaps a researcher who 
is able to negotiate a greater degree of trust and access could provide insights 
into these matters. Then again, another reason why I believe my attempts to 
shadow Khoisan traditional leaders in their explicit capacity as such were not 
successful is because Khoisan revivalists in general face organizational chal­
lenges. and it is not always clear (to them) what their (day-​to-​day) activities 
consist of. In other words, for reasons I elaborate on below, while I interacted 
with various Khoisan traditional leaders, it was unclear whether they were act­
ing in that capacity at the time.
This brings me to the main argument I want to develop with regards to 
Khoisan traditional leadership within Khoisan revivalist circles in Cape 
Town: emic perspectives on Khoisan traditional leadership are articulated in 
conjunction with contested, shifting, and at times contradictory, sets of criteria, 
which in turn suggests there is a strong improvisational component to them, 
rather than a uniform adherence to a specific historical reference point.14 As 
I noted in Chapter 3, Khoisan revivalist traditional leaders often face scrutiny 
for the way they reference the historical record to bolster their lineage and 
entitlement claims. In no other Khoisan revivalism-​related context are claims 
	14	
I am not trying to ascertain whether or not these entities are ‘tribes’, ‘clans’, or institu­
tions of ‘traditional leadership’ as defined in some of the (older) literature. Drawing on 
Archie Mafeje (1971, 18), it is perhaps more accurate to speak of an ‘ideology of tribalism’ 
rather than an empirical ‘tribalism’, as ‘things are not necessarily what they are known as 
socially’. While one can certainly be critical towards the explanatory potential of the ter­
minology that is used (in English) to describe traditional leadership in Khoisan revivalist 
circles, this is not my aim here, and I stick with emic registers.

as contested and potentially impactful as in the realm of Khoisan traditional 
leadership. Critics’ insistence on fact-​checking claims is therefore highly 
appropriate (see also Oomen 2005, 113). However, perhaps as a consequence 
of the apparent inflation of such claims, scholars have been less inclined to 
explore other reasons why Khoisan revivalists use traditional leadership titles 
and set up traditional leadership organizations. An important exception is 
William Ellis, who argued that Khoisan revivalist traditional leaders in many 
ways function like their historical predecessors, who also had a ‘situational’, 
i.e. improvisational, creative, and dynamic mode of leadership (Ellis 2019). For 
Ellis, Khoisan revivalism continues to revolve around spokespersons who are 
‘leaders’ in their own right in certain settings but embody a link to Khoisan ‘tra­
dition’ that renders them credible ‘traditional leaders’ by their peers and fol­
lowers. I read Ellis’ argument as an invitation for further ethnographic research 
on Khoisan revivalist traditional leadership, in particular about the arguments 
that are mobilized to bolster and contest such claims. The following foray into 
issues of Khoisan traditional leadership therefore proceeds along these lines.
Regarding the use and interpretation of the different types of titles them­
selves, as one Khoisan revivalist observed in relation to the word ‘chief’, which 
is most commonly used by Khoisan revivalists to denote a position of tradi­
tional leadership, ‘in the Khoisan revival we use the title ‘chief’ with no clear 
meaning or content to the title’ (enn 2013e, 5). As varied as are the expressions 
of traditional leadership, likewise are the divergence of opinions about it. To 
some, ‘chief’ is a demeaning and offensive colonialist label (Cornelius Kok, 02/​
09/​2014). Some argue there were never ‘kings’ in Khoisan history, while oth­
ers vehemently defend a monarchical tradition (enn 2013b, 10). Some of my 
interlocutors claimed patrilineal succession should be the organizing princi­
ple among Khoisan traditional leaders, while others believed the title of ‘chief’ 
should pass to the oldest living member. Yet others believed a successor should 
simply be appointed by the incumbent. One Khoisan revivalist even turned to 
the work of the historian Richard Elphick to clarify how traditional leadership 
titles ought to function in Khoisan revivalism (enn 2013e, 5). Yvette Abrahams 
(16/​07/​2019) in turn argues that her historical research has shown that hier­
archical positions of leadership were a reaction to colonialism and in fact are 
foreign to the precolonial Khoisan, as there is no evidence to argue otherwise. 
While she decries the rapid increase of and competition over traditional lead­
ership positions, she understands that people might view it as a ‘vehicle out of 
their marginalization’ and did not have the same privileged access to informa­
tion she enjoyed as an academic. Abrahams moreover sees the diverse expres­
sions of traditional leadership as potentially liberating, in the sense that they

Chapter 5
refuse to fit into a government-​approved mould and continuously prompt new 
interpretations of the institution.
On that note, I got the impression that titles such as ‘chief’ and ‘leader’ are 
more often used to show respect and acknowledge one’s commitment to the 
cause of Khoisan revivalism than to endorse someone’s specific claims. As 
I show below, one’s contributions to Khoisan revivalism are indeed regularly 
factored in. Interestingly enough, the legitimacy of a specific person’s claim is 
usually not questioned publicly. This might be because Khoisan revivalists are 
well aware of the fact that such contestations more often than not only add fuel 
to the fire and in turn cause political negotiations to stall, or at least become 
more complex. Barring criticism of the nkc, or any other government-​spon­
sored entity for that matter, contestations of leadership claims in the main take 
place in private, through gossip or closed chat groups on social media. Another 
way they find expression is by being referenced indirectly or in abstract terms, 
such as the complaint in enn (2014j, 13) that ‘certain organizations’ often 
make claims ‘on behalf of the nation’ without holding the mandate to do so. As 
will become apparent, the more a Khoisan traditional leader or organization 
reaches prominence, manages to secure meetings with government officials, 
or accesses funding, the more their legitimacy will be contested in public by 
other Khoisan revivalists. This is also the case when their claims of entitlement 
compete with those of others or reach great heights, as was the case with King 
Cornelius and his ssogh. Indeed, if mostly done so privately, the boundaries 
of Khoisan traditional leadership are fiercely policed, and charges of oppor­
tunism abound because so much is thought to be at stake, ranging from bene­
fits related to the tkla, to simply being in a position of power to lead others. 
William Langeveldt (27/​03/​2018) discerned a scourge of ‘fly-​by-​night chiefs, 
opportunists’ in this regard. Chantal Revell (10/​12/​2014) also mentioned that 
some ‘suddenly became chiefs’ when they sensed benefits were forthcoming. 
To one interlocutor, traditional leadership legislation was therefore ‘a little car­
rot on a stick’, yet ‘another push to assimilate us and pit us against one another’ 
(Hillary Solomon, 10/​10/​2017).
As I noted in Chapter 3, many Khoisan revivalists became less involved 
because they believe traditional leadership contestations were causing the 
whole endeavour to stray from its original purpose. Vanessa Ludwig (19/​08/​
2019) for instance felt that ‘in the beginning the movement was about invisi­
bility, not about materiality as it has now become for many. We did not have 
this stratified system of chiefs […] The government puts their own understand­
ing of culture on us, we cannot accept it’. Basil Coetzee (06/​05/​2018), who like 
Ludwig was deeply involved in the early days of Khoisan revivalism, likewise 
believes ‘chieftaincy ruined everything […] our original cause was to free

people of mental slavery’. He regrets that those Khoisan revivalist traditional 
leaders who arrived later seem less interested in ‘assisting with the recognition 
of heritage or preservation of it’ (Basil Coetzee, 13/​12/​2018). Like many others, 
Coetzee suspects that many publicly reject the tkla but are in effect mobiliz­
ing behind the scenes to reap its benefits when it becomes law:
Somebody who called himself proudly Coloured a few years ago; how 
can he be King today? […] People fabricate bloodlines, copy paste from 
Google and so forth. I am the spoke in their wheels because I am familiar 
with this history and I point out these fabrications […] Today there are 
about nine or eleven Cochoqua houses so I withdrew myself. I am not 
part of a circus. I am busy with restoring a people’s dignity. I am not in it 
for a job.
basil coetzee, 25/​04/​2018; 06/​05/​201815
Coetzee himself was appointed as ‘chief’ of the Cochoqua tribe within the 
ccdhc. However, he argues that this was different for various reasons. The 
cchdc used the concepts ‘chief’ and ‘tribe’ because they opted to work with 
the information they had at the time, even if they suspected it was not entirely 
faithful to the way Khoisan traditional society was originally organized (Basil 
Coetzee, 13/​12/​2018). Their intent was never to ‘retribalize people’ by recreat­
ing ‘tribal settings’ but to create ‘structures to coordinate’ headed by people 
they could trust. Through the cchdc and related organizations I discussed 
in Chapter 3, Coetzee and others came up with a set of internal rules for the 
recognition of Khoisan traditional leaders. This effectively meant that anyone 
who was in some kind of position of leadership within a certain community 
or area could apply for recognition, provided that position had not yet been 
filled. However, as I showed, this system collapsed as people began competing 
over positions, particularly those at the top of the hierarchy (see below). Then 
again, for Coetzee (25/​04/​2018) chieftaincy should have nothing to do with pol­
itics or power, which is why he prefers Khoeseb (Khoeses for women) these 
days, which means ‘man of high standing’. Coetzee believes traditional lead­
ership should be mostly ceremonial: ‘I am a community activist, chieftaincy 
is not about that […] Politically I am Basil Coetzee. People know me as a Khoi 
chief because of my many years of service and because I am a custodian’.
	15	
Basil Coetzee was not exaggerating when he noted that there are numerous people com­
peting over the same title or claim to be the leader of the same historical tribe. During 
the 2018 public hearing on the tkla I described briefly in Chapter 3, three speakers for 
instance claimed they were the ‘chief’ of the Cochoqua.

Chapter 5
Zenzile Khoisan (24/​05/​2018) concurs that ‘there is a place and time for tra­
ditionalism’ but that it should never come at the expense of ‘constitutional 
liberties and rights’. We should not confuse ‘an indigenous leader with indi­
geneity’, particularly if they promote the ‘racist and reactionary principles’ 
enshrined in the tkla (Zenzile Khoisan, 07/​05/​2018). On that note, Zenzile 
(24/​05/​2018) stressed he did not believe that people should become subsumed 
under a ‘chieftaincy’, if they did not want to, and that leaders equipped with 
certain powers should never be left unaccountable. Rather than a ‘vertical’ 
leadership design, he sees more potential in the ‘circular’ model ‘practiced 
by the Bushmen’, based on listening and consultation, rather than delegation 
(Zenzile Khoisan, 29/​06/​2018). This mode of leadership is seldom put into 
practice and many instead shape the institution with ‘underdeveloped ideas’. 
He fears that Khoisan traditional leadership is increasingly becoming a cover 
to promote retrograde agendas and curtail women’s rights (see also Ainslie and 
Kepe 2016, 28). While the sexes seem more or less evenly represented among 
Khoisan revivalist traditional leaders, Chantal Revell (19/​08/​2019) has indeed 
experienced how some draw on supposed ‘Khoisan traditions’ to discriminate 
against women. During our conversations, Zenzile (29/​06/​2018) often won­
dered if these types of issues were not signs that he should relinquish his sup­
port for the institution of Khoisan traditional leadership alltogether, beginning 
with his own Gorinhaiqua Cultural Council. As far as I can tell he has not dis­
banded the Council to date, but he certainly continues to call out those who 
mobilize Khoisan traditional leadership to stoke conflicts and manufacture 
claims of ‘purity’ in the process.
Appeals to genetics are at times mobilized in intra-​indigenous conflicts 
over leadership positions (see e.g. Sturm 2002, 203–​204; see above), but 
such contestations are absent in Khoisan revivalist circles. Critics have 
pointed out that genetic identity claims flirt dangerously close with notions 
of essentialism by conflating dna with identity labels (Brodwin 2002, 323–​
327; Jobling, Rasteiro, and Wetton 2016). However, contrary to what some 
scholars have claimed with regards to Khoisan revivalism (see e.g. Morris 
1997; Erasmus 2013, 40, 44), I have not seen references to genetic ancestry 
become mobilized to trump the rights of others or to manufacture claims 
of purity. As I explained in the Introduction, the genetic strain most com­
monly associated with the Khoisan is most prevalent among present-​day 
Coloureds, though certainly not exclusively. Virtually all Khoisan revivalists 
acknowledge this. However, they often simultaneously emphasize that if 
someone were to judge their identities through a genetic lens, their claim 
would be the least refutable (see e.g. enn 2013b, 3; irasa 2012, 16; enn 2017a, 
11). Laying claim to genetic descent is an added bonus, so to speak, not an

absolute criterion to claim Khoisan identity. Genetic descent is therefore 
mostly appealed to in the abstract sense, as a type of scientific leverage to 
rebuke notions that the Khoisan are extinct, not to bolster personal claims to 
Khoisan identity or traditional leadership positions as being (more) pure (cf. 
Schramm 2016, 138–​139). Some have explicitly rejected undergoing a genetic 
test because they feel that would reify colonialist ideologies of purity and 
blood quantum (Mackie, 08/​01/​2015). As Ruben Richards (2017, 102) put it, 
while ‘the dna of the ancestors [is] still running through their veins –​ with 
the heartbeat of the first nation still pumping in their breasts –​ pumping 
with a sense of pride and dignity’, for Khoisan revivalists, genetics is but ‘only 
one element in the identity mix’.
More hotly contested than genetics are so-​called bloodline claims or 
notions of adhering to ‘authentic’ Khoisan cultural practices. There is no agree­
ment among Khoisan revivalists about the importance of either of these when 
claiming traditional leadership positions. Some, such as King Cornelius, claim 
to be direct descendants from historical Khoisan leaders. ‘Chief Gokou ii of 
Hessekwa’ from Riversdale for instance claims he is a fifth-​generation descen­
dant from ‘Chief Gokou’, and therefore entitled to wield his authority over a vast 
stretch of territory (enn 2017a, 4). However, perhaps because such claims are 
believed to be untenable, bloodline descent is seldom mobilized this explicitly. 
Most seem uncertain about the extent to which claiming continuity with the 
past in genealogical terms or otherwise ought to be important (see Chapter 6). 
While a 2012 document compiled by irasa notes that the Khoisan should ‘not 
be fragmented with various clans, which is reinforced by ideological political 
prospects’ (irasa 2012, 160), Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras (05/​01/​2015) seems to 
have changed her mind when she told me in 2015 that the only way to avoid 
‘making a joke out of the whole thing’ is to prove one’s bloodline and ancestry. 
Proceeding in this fashion would weed out the various ‘opportunists’ that are 
‘degrading’ the cause by fraudulently claiming descent from historical ‘clans’ 
and taking on a swathe of ‘Eurocentric’ titles –​ ‘chief’ being the only exemp­
tion, which, according to her, reflects original Khoisan traditional leadership 
titles. As her family is from the West Coast, which she considers historical 
Cochoqua territory, she aligned herself with the Cochoqua and assumed the 
title of chief (Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras 03/​01/​2015; see also Verbuyst 2015, 106–​
110). When it comes to asserting positions of leadership, Kleinhans-​Cedras (23/​
01/​2015) believes that ‘talk is cheap’ and that one’s track-​record should count 
most of all, not bloodline descent. She maintains in this regard that irasa 
was ‘the only Aboriginal KhoiSan organization that has steadfastly refused 
to be co-​opted politically [and] unambiguously maintained our Aboriginal 
Cultural KhoiSan stance, categorically and publicly’ (irasa 2012, 160). Equally

Chapter 5
important in claiming traditional leadership positions is one’s involvement in 
their community:
If you are not doing work in the area to uplift the people, that should dis­
qualify you. In the case of traditional leadership it is more about revival­
ist efforts than claiming bloodline descent […] You can either be elected 
by people as chief or by birth right. The Commission on Khoi-​San matters 
is going to make a public fool out of many people that are claiming all 
those things only to see them debunked.
tania kleinhans-​cedras, 11/​07/​2018
Chantal Revell (19/​08/​2019) takes a similar stance. She refused to become a 
chief or to take any other title when she first became involved in Khoisan reviv­
alism. However, when the Katz Korana Royal House kept insisting that Revell 
officially join their House as a ‘princess’, she eventually accepted. King Katz 
felt she had put in so much effort to help organize the Royal House that she 
had become like a daughter to him, hence he believed the ‘adoption’-​gesture 
was appropriate. As Revell clarifies, her title is honorary, as Katz’ grandson will 
inherit his grandfather’s title. She soon experienced that the title of princess 
opened doors for her, particularly when trying to get meetings. Experiencing 
the effects of her newfound title on her daily life made her realize that tra­
ditional leadership titles were perhaps more than anything an appropriate 
form of recognition of one’s contributions to Khoisan revivalism (see above), 
which is why Revell makes a point of using people’s preferred titles as a way of 
showing respect. She is confident that the legality and validity of claims will be 
vetted later, once appropriate legislation is in place. According to Revell, blood­
line descent should not be the only criteria, but those that can legitimately 
make such claims do have a special role, as she believes they are the closest one 
can get to a custodian of ‘traditional Khoisan culture’. This is why she had to 
‘travel to the Kalahari to look for my leaders’ when she started being involved 
in Khoisan revivalism (Chantal Revell, 07/​10/​2014). Revell (07/​03/​2018) regrets 
that newcomers do not ‘respect the knowledge of their elders’, mostly out of 
ignorance, as this causes a lot of infighting. While much of this ‘ancient his­
tory’ still needs to be assembled and updated to adhere to ‘modern times’, she 
believes ‘traditional culture’ should function as a guide to Khoisan traditional 
leaders: ‘When it comes to us, people mix everything, they make their own 
culture. They do not study or go into the history’.
Some in fact hold that practicing authentic Khoisan culture should be the 
main requirement to occupy traditional leadership positions. Aaron Messelaar 
(2015, v) believes that a Khoisan traditional leader should first and foremost

The Khoisan Identity Discourse (ii)

possess a solid foundation in traditions and customs; something he finds 
many Khoisan revivalists lack. As he put it to me during an interview, many 
of the recent Khoisan revivalist traditional leaders ‘said before they are not 
Khoi because they have European ancestry […] I ask them: you say you are a 
chief where are your Indians? What about your wife and children? Are they 
a part of it? If not, how can you be a chief’ (Aaron Messelaar, 16/​03/​2018). It 
is a net positive that people are rediscovering their identities, but too many 
are opportunistically claiming traditional leaderships titles, turning a cultural 
movement into a political competition (Aaron Messelaar, 06/​10/​2017). Some 
Khoisan revivalists, such as Ernest Solomon, have anticipated such criticisms 
by stressing that they ‘were confirmed entirely according to indigenous pro­
tocols’ by undergoing the ‘New Moon !Nau of dedication’ (enn 2015, 4; see 
Chapter 6). He also warned that leaders who lack such credentials and instead 
‘see the Khoisan revival as a way to abuse our people [and] do not have the 
concerns of our people at heart, but use the cause for their own benefit’ will be 
purged (enn 2014e, 2). Joseph Little (08/​05/​2018) for his part regards himself 
as the sole ‘paramount chief’ and therefore the only one fit to carry out !Nau 
ceremonies to usher in new chiefs (see Chapter 3). He disqualifies anyone who 
was not sworn in through a !Nau he presided over as others do not possess the 
required cultural knowledge and occupy the appropriate positions to conduct 
such a ceremony. Little is confident that future developments will bear this 
out and put a stop to the current climate of ‘opportunism and back-​stabbing’. 
People were still welcome to apply for recognition with him as long as they 
adhered to the guidelines of the cchdc, that is, if they hail from a specific 
area where no tribal house has yet been established, explain why they have not 
come forth earlier, and gathered a ‘tribal council’ of at least 12 people (Joseph 
Little, 17/​05/​2018). As I show in the following chapter when I discuss the !Nau 
in more detail, Little continues to carry out such ceremonies till this day.
As I suggested earlier, exchanges over what constitutes appropriate ‘tradi­
tional’ cultural behaviour and who qualifies as a Khoisan traditional leader 
can get especially heated when there is competition over specific resources. 
A prime example is the conflict that occurred in 2014 over the rights to access 
the potential Khoisan heritage site at the eco-​village located in Oude Molen in 
the Cape Town suburb of Pinelands. Some Khoisan revivalists believe it went 
unrecognized that this is where the defeat of D’Almeida took place in 1510 
(enn 2014b, 8). As I explained in the previous chapter, 1510 is celebrated by 
Khoisan revivalists as the first anti-​colonial battle. The Gorinhaiqua Cultural 
Council, led by Zenzile Khoisan, furthermore believed Oude Molen was where 
the kraal of the 17th century leader of the Gorinhaiqua, Gogosoa, was orig­
inally located and therefore also where the First Khoikhoi-​Dutch war took

place (enn 2013d, 3; 2014f, 3; see also Verbuyst 2015, 97–​99). As the revived 
Gorinhaiqua, the group felt they had to turn the site into a space where ‘we can 
begin to rebuild ourselves, and heal from the historical trauma at the hands of 
those who attempted to crush Khoisan people in an orgy of cultural genocide’ 
(enn 2014b, 1, 8). irasa, and primarily Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras, argued that 
the site instead belonged to all –​ claiming it for just one group sowed disunity 
(Nombembe 2014).16 Together with some 50 followers, she proceeded to occupy 
the site for several days, although she declined to characterize it as an ‘occupa­
tion’, since the land belonged to the Khoisan, and instead described it as an ‘act 
of restoration’. The Gorinhaiqua Cultural Council reportedly condemned their 
actions as a publicity stunt that ran counter to ‘Khoi principles’ and would 
only antagonize the government and make negotiating future access to the site 
more complicated (Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras, 14/​10/​2014). They also added that 
irasa was ‘not grounded in any customary or indigenous protocol’ and had 
only managed to marginalize itself within the broader Khoisan movement and 
sow disunity, ‘possibly with a commercial motive’.
It is unclear what further transpired at Oude Molen. The occupation ended 
shortly after it was initiated and the area has not been turned into a heritage 
site to date. The actors involved seem to have resolved their conflict, in so far 
as I regularly spotted them together at events interacting with each other on 
an amicable basis. Khoisan revivalists understand that infighting is ultimately 
detrimental to their cause as they could exert more pressure on the govern­
ment by working together, and this realization might have played a role. Many 
have certainly actively sought to unite competing factions. Chantal Revell (07/​
10/​2014), who has a background in counselling, has been attempting to unify 
Khoisan traditional leaders since 2013 (see also enn 2014j, 12). Her efforts have 
been only marginally successful, a track-​record she partially blames on the 
lasting legacy of colonial divide-​and-​rule tactics: ‘We are a nation in arrested 
development. Colonialism split up families and pitted members against each 
other’. During a protest on Indigenous People’s Day in 2017, which I discuss 
in more detail in the next chapter, there was an episode that captured very 
well how emotions can run high during these attempts to quell infighting. As 
a couple of dozen Khoisan revivalists were standing in a circle after the pro­
test to discuss the way forward,disunity was diagnosed as the main impedi­
ment. The usual speeches were given, suggesting that there was no need to 
	16	
As I noted earlier, Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras later apparently changed her mind and 
believed that affiliating with one particular historical tribe was appropriate. Ironically, 
Zenzile Khoisan for his part contemplated dissolving his own group because he believed 
this might facilitate creating unity among Khoisan revivalists.

fight as everyone essentially wanted the same thing. Revell intervened by ask­
ing the female traditional leaders to step forward and hold her hand in prayer. 
They all agreed on a solemn ‘declaration’ to set the right example by no lon­
ger attacking each other in the future, some of them in tears. The Foundation 
Nation Restoration (fnr) has also organized several ‘Foundation Nation 
Convocations’ since 2013 to unite the Khoisan by drawing on religious princi­
ples (see Chapter 4). I attended one of these events in 2014. The various attend­
ees were asked at the beginning of the proceedings to walk through a maze 
made out of carton boxes, which had notes pinned to them identifying ‘inter­
nal’ and ‘external’ challenges (i.e. ‘distrust’, ‘money’, ‘government interference’) 
(see also enn 2014k, 7). The idea was to confront these challenges and emerge 
stronger from the ‘maze’ and engage in a productive dialogue about ‘the bigger 
picture’ afterwards.
Infighting has been addressed in various other ways, but one suggestion that 
keeps coming up and needs to be elaborated on in light of this subchapter’s 
focus is that of setting up one overarching organization of Khoisan traditional 
leaders, where all parties have an equal say and get the opportunity to work 
out their differences free from government interference (see e.g. enn 2013a, 
12). There have been several attempts to establish such bodies, but none seems 
to have achieved their stated objective. A case in point is King Cornelius and 
his ssogh, which did not become a rallying point for Khoisan revivalists, on 
the contrary. Another organization that actively pursues unity is the Western 
Cape Legislative Khoisan Council (wclksc). It was established in 2015, with 
‘all the Aboriginal Nation Formations […] of the Western Cape and elsewhere 
present […] after a series of crisis meetings’ (wclksc 2018, 1). As its first act, 
the wclksc (ibid.) revoked all the government appointed bodies that nego­
tiate about Khoisan issues and asserted that they would henceforth take the 
lead. The group argues this was greenlighted by various government officials, 
who reportedly recognized the wclksc as ‘the most representative body of 
the KhoiSan in the Western Cape’. I did not come across this endorsement, and 
hardly any of my interlocutors mentioned the wclksc. It is also unclear what 
its specific ambitions are or how it seeks to accomplish them. Mackie (05/​07/​
2018), who chairs the organization, believes that tribalism is undesirable as it 
pits people against each other. Yet he also defended his chairmanship by not­
ing that he was ‘elected by the 17 tribes’ that make up the organization. Mackie 
(04/​07/​2018) also asserts that there is nobody with an ‘unbroken lineage’ and 
that people should therefore first and foremost feel part of ‘a nation, a col­
lective’. In the wclksc’s (2018, 3) submission to Parliament concerning the 
tkla, however, it explicitly demands that ‘Cape Khoi clans [be] recognized

Chapter 5
individually, not collectively’. It is unclear if the wclksc is still in operation, 
how large its support base is, and what it has accomplished thus far.
As I noted in Chapter 3, one organization that took the initiative to unify 
the Khoisan to a great extent was Khoisan Kingdom (ksk). Despite its name, 
ksk described itself as a non-​monarchical entity. Yet they clearly attempted 
to become the leading arbiter concerning who counts and does not count as 
Khoisan. In an advert in enn (2014a, 3–​4) entitled ‘Strength in numbers’, the 
ksk assessed that ‘the movement for the recognition of Khoisan rights has 
been plagued by problems of disunity and general ill-​discipline’ and called 
to ‘gather around one table and talk with one voice’. They more specifically 
pleaded with Khoisan revivalists to stop creating their own organizations and 
join ksk (enn 2014j, 12). ksk members profiled their organization as the sole 
body capable of pushing Khoisan politics forward. Khoisan revivalists regu­
larly complain that there are not enough people with the skills and training to 
effectively run an organization (De Wet 2010b, 26–​27). ksk therefore empha­
sized that they were the only ones with a ‘clear plan’ and strategy on when and 
how to effectively deploy ‘human and material resources’ to make sure initia­
tives were not ‘short-​lived or sabotaged’ (enn 2014d, 14). A member who had 
recently joined the ksk wrote to enn (2014a, 3) to endorse them as ‘the only 
effective vehicle for the unification of the Khoi and Boesman Nation’. Most 
Khoisan-​related initiatives are also self-​funded, which poses a huge challenge 
to many (De Wet 2010b, 58). In organizing various activities across Cape Town 
(and beyond) and buying up advertising space in enn, ksk has clearly shown 
it has ample financial capital. They also boasted on one occasion that they had 
‘briefed a team of advocates and experts in the field’ to ensure ‘Khoisan’ would 
be included in the census of 2021 (enn 2014k, 4; see above).
While membership was free and could be arranged by filling in a short 
form on their website, which is now offline, the criteria were never specified 
(enn 2014a, 3–​4).17 By showing ‘strength in numbers’, ksk aimed to counter 
the government’s supposed excuse that it was impossible to negotiate with the 
Khoisan because there was no clear leadership in place (enn 2014b, 5). In an 
open letter to politicians ahead of the general elections of 2014, ksk represen­
tatives notified the government it would need to recognize their organization 
‘as the representative of most Khoisan structures’ alongside the ‘customary 
roles and positions’ it had to fulfil (ibid.). ksk not only argued they should be 
	17	
As I showed at the beginning of this chapter with King Cornelius and the ssogh, the 
practice of amassing members by letting them sign forms is ongoing, perhaps in large part 
because the incoming Commission on Khoi-​San matters will likely vet Khoisan organiza­
tions in part based on their number of followers (see Chapter 3).

recognized because they had unified the Khoisan but also because they had 
earned their traditional leadership credentials through their actions, ‘the real 
test to see who someone really is’ (enn 2014d, 15). This, they argued, should be 
one of the ‘fundamental criteria’ for how Khoisan traditional leadership is rec­
ognized in the spirit of ‘self-​determination’, together with ‘group-​acceptance’ 
and ‘a combination of strict and loose bloodlines’ (enn 2014g, 4, 8). While it 
claimed in 2014 it would manage to rally ‘99% of houses […] on own initiative 
and not government driven’ under its banner by the end of the year, it appar­
ently ceased its operations soon thereafter (enn 2014a, 4).
The specifics of ksk’s apparent inactivity are unknown to me, but it is clear 
that initiatives like these seem to collapse because of mistrust, lack of finan­
cial resources and skills, and a host of other differences of opinion regarding 
Khoisan revivalist traditional leadership claims I laid out (see also Verbuyst 
2015, 141). The tkla might streamline such efforts in the future or at least reg­
ulate the way Khoisan revivalist traditional leadership organizations (cannot) 
structure themselves –​ a topic I revisit in the concluding chapter. However, 
the different interpretations of traditional leadership are likely to remain 
precisely because the institution is malleable to Khoisan revivalists’ current 
needs. As I showed, the contestations indeed largely revolve around the degree 
to which continuity with the past and change are permissible. Seen in this 
light, Khoisan traditional leadership is but one aspect of Khoisan revivalism 
as a whole, which, as I show in the next chapter, navigates the same tensions, 
though perhaps with less politically-​charged consequences at stake.

bradley van sitters, 2019 State of the Union Address
∵
Cape Town-​based Khoisan revivalist Bradley van Sitters delivered these words 
in Khoekhoegowab at the 2019 State of the Union Address, where he was that 
year’s praise singer.1 Never before was a Khoisan representative invited to rit­
ually introduce the president or was Khoekhoegowab spoken on such an occa­
sion. The event marked 25 years since the advent of democracy in South Africa, 
further increasing its significance. Aside from lauding Cyril Ramaphosa, who 
ascended to the presidency after Jacob Zuma resigned in the face of mounting 
corruption scandals in 2018, and pleading with Tsui //​Goatse to bring rain to 
break the protracted dry spell South Africa was experiencing at the time, Van 
Sitters used his brief moment in the limelight to draw attention to Khoisan 
issues as well. Though few at the time were capable of following what he was

saying, Van Sitters emphasized the ancientness of Khoekhoegowab, deliberately 
spoke of //​Hui !Gaeb instead of Cape Town, and called on everyone to ‘unite for 
our heritage’. Not contained in the transcript he provided to the media but 
apparent in the video footage, Van Sitters, who was dressed in animal skins, 
also honoured Khoisan ancestors such as Krotoa, Xhoré, and Autshumato –​ a 
practice I have witnessed on several other occasions (Khoza 2019; see below). 
The mp s and various dignitaries in attendance enthusiastically repeated their 
names as Van Sitters lifted a set of kudu horns above his head and pointed 
them in all cardinal directions. Chantal Revell stood behind Van Sitters the 
whole time, beating a drum and keeping a modest profile. She had been instru­
mental in getting him on board just hours before. Ramaphosa had explicitly 
requested a Khoisan praise singer and the nkc was asked to suggest poten­
tial candidates (Chantal Revell, 26/​06/​2019). After its chairperson learned that 
Paul Swartbooi, a Nama from the Northern Cape, was not available, Revell was 
asked to get in touch with Van Sitters, who is well-​known for his language activ­
ism in the Cape Town area.
The pair made history on 20 June 2019, but all eyes were on Van Sitters. 
Zindzi Mandela, the ambassador to Denmark and daughter of ex-​President 
Nelson Mandela, tweeted that his performance had given her ‘goosebumps’.2 
Khoisan revivalists lit up my social media feed with posts congratulating Van 
Sitters and celebrating his actions as a turning point for Khoisan revivalism. 
Many of them also rushed to his defence when a number of critics put the 
authenticity of his speech into question. A Namibian journalist charged Van 
Sitters with not speaking the language ‘properly’ and thereby peddling a ‘mis­
representation’ (Khoza 2019). Van Sitters, who studied Khoekhoegowab at the 
University of Namibia, readily admitted he was not a native speaker, nor ‘the 
best speaker, best linguist’, but that he made up for it with his passion for 
the language and Khoisan culture.3 Focussing on accuracy moreover risked 
detracting attention away from the more pressing matter of officially recogniz­
ing Khoisan languages in South Africa. In Van Sitters’ view, his way of speaking 
Khoekhoegowab should be seen as a new ‘dialect’ –​ a Khoisan revivalist dialect, 
one might say.4

Chapter 6
The debate that ensued in the wake of the 2019 State of the Nation Address 
only partially revolved around language, a topic I revisit later on in this chapter. 
The ‘authenticity’ of acts of Khoisan revivalism were scrutinized more broadly 
in the process as well. Indeed, Patrick Tariq Mellet, who I introduced in the 
previous chapter, responded to Van Sitters’ critics on Facebook by suggesting 
how one should (and should not) consider the notion of authenticity in a set­
ting of indigenous revivalism:
The critics say that Bradley had a poor grasp of the Khoekhoegowab 
language, had difficulty with pronunciation, utilised memory of known 
Khoekhoegowab texts etc. So what! […] It is quite understandable that 
people are feeling their way through their cultural roots and are on a 
learning curve […] Purity arguments are at root based in Apartheid racist 
mentalities and those who hold such views are as so-​called ‘impure’ as 
the rest of us. They live in a fool’s paradise of impurity. Bradley is no char­
latan and makes no claim to be born ‘pure’ […] Yes our brother Bradley 
showed all the scars of this past in his rendition. It only makes him more 
authentic than less so.5
By rejecting ‘purity’ and affirming ‘authenticity’ in spite of the ‘scars of the 
past’, Mellet’s riposte aptly names the tension between ‘continuity’ and 
‘change’ embedded in the revival of Khoisan culture. Distinguishing between 
acts of Khoisan revivalism that constitute ‘continuity’ or ‘change’ vis-​à-​vis the 
past does not contradict my definition of indigenous revivalism as a dynamic 
process that continuously navigates ‘past’ and ‘present’ (see Introduction). 
As with any other ‘culture’, every expression of Khoisan revivalism evidences 
some measure of continuity and some degree of change. One can, and should, 
question the arbitrary nature of the reference points that determine such 
equations. If seen in this manner, ‘continuity’ and ‘change’ correspond to out­
dated conceptualizations of static cultures, which, in the spirit of the Khoisan 
extinction discourse, could moreover disqualify Khoisan revivalism as inau­
thentic for being tainted with ‘change’. As Sam Pack (2012, 177) put it with 
regards to the similar binary ‘traditional-​modern’: ‘they connote a false water­
shed demarcating a pristine past that has been sullied by contemporary forces’. 
And yet, I argue that ‘continuity’ and ‘change’ can retain analytical purchase if 
they are not used as etic measuring sticks but understood as emic signifiers.

Reviving Khoisan Culture
233
Khoisan revivalists themselves often, though certainly not always (see below), 
find these kinds of terms meaningful to differentiate between their own and 
others’ efforts. As I showed in previous chapters and elaborate on in the next, 
appraising each other’s ‘continuity’ and ‘change’ is to a large extent part and 
parcel of the competition over the ‘authenticity’ that is believed to be required 
to access (potential) resources and recognition. However, I argue that the use 
of such categories also reflects different motivations for reviving Khoisan cul­
ture. Hence I divide the subchapters into acts of Khoisan revivalism that seek 
to emulate the past as it once ‘was’ and those that deliberately introduce novel 
or innovative elements. Granted, this does not absolve me of nevertheless 
determining where my interlocutors place their emphasis, which is rarely one-​
sided. In that sense, consigning certain data into one subchapter or the other 
remains arbitrary. However, as I show below, the distinction proves meaningful 
as an analytical lens in that it reveals paradoxical strategies of reviving Khoisan 
culture: emphasizing continuity or change are equally potent.
Three caveats are in order before proceeding. The first relates to my method­
ological limitations. My open-​ended definition of Khoisan revivalism impedes 
a comprehensive overview as it encompasses both large-​scale public events 
as well as private everyday acts (see Chapter 1). This means that I have already 
said a great deal about the revival of Khoisan culture at this point. The dif­
ference in this chapter is that I shift the emphasis from what Khoisan reviv­
alists say to what they do. But here too, I am faced with certain challenges. 
The writing process in particular has exposed various gaps. The fine-​grained 
ethnographic data I was set on collecting has in some respects taken a backseat 
to a more varied overview of events. This is in part because of my intention to 
survey Khoisan revivalism as a whole and my fears of getting bogged down in 
a case study that might not be ‘representative’. Another factor relates to my 
positionality (see Chapter 1). During fieldwork, I often felt I had to straddle a 
fine line between expressing genuine interest in, and being respectful towards, 
Khoisan identity and culture, at times by maintaining an appropriate distance 
and prying about details, origins, and meanings. As I explained with regard 
to traditional leadership in the previous chapter, probing these issues might 
come off as inquisitive. Someone who is able to negotiate a greater degree of 
trust might receive more leeway and insight into the ‘backstage’. It is not so 
much that I was explicitly made aware of this by Khoisan revivalists (although 
that did happen on occasion) or that I am implying they did so because they 
have something to ‘hide’. Rather, it was a gut-​feeling I experienced during field­
work, which subsequently impacted my data-​collection.
Then again, and this brings me to the second caveat, topics such as culture 
and authenticity are sensitive for many Khoisan revivalists. There are two

principal reasons for this. As I noted above and showed in Chapter 5 in partic­
ular, there is a widespread perception that being ‘authentic’ is key to procur­
ing resources and, true enough, the Traditional and Khoi-​San Leadership Act 
(tkla) demands that Khoisan revivalists (and others) conform to a certain 
type of authenticity in order to qualify for benefits. A second, related reason 
why culture and authenticity are loaded terms for Khoisan revivalists is the 
belief that their authenticity is judged more severely than that of others due 
to the spectre of the Khoisan extinction discourse. Some Khoisan revivalists 
reference the ‘cultural genocide’ in this regard, a common recourse in contexts 
involving indigenous people (cf. Niezen 2003, 5). While argued for by various 
Khoisan revivalists (see e.g. enn 2014j, 3; 2016a, 14), irasa members were espe­
cially instrumental in mainstreaming the term. In a couple of articles for Eland 
Nuus, irasa explained what they mean by this concept:
Cultural genocide extends beyond attacks upon the physical and or bio­
logical elements of our KhoiSan nation and seeks to eliminate its wider 
institutions. It is the complete destruction of a culture for political, racial 
or military reasons, which includes language, art, music, traditions, reli­
gious and anything else unique to that specific culture […] To embrace the 
term ‘coloured’ makes you culpable of cultural genocide!
en 2012c, 9; 2012e, 9
Cultural genocide thus refers to both the historical and contemporary systemic 
erasure, assimilation, and suppression of Khoisan identity and culture. In 2012, 
an irasa delegation travelled to New York to put it in a complaint with the 
United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (Tania Kleinhans-​
Cedras, 05/​01/​2015). In the document in question, entitled ‘Cultural Genocide 
of the KhoiSan Nation’, irasa pleads for increased support by noting that they 
meet all the requirements to be recognized as indigenous people as stipulated 
in relevant international legislation. For Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras (03/​01/​2015), 
the legacies of cultural genocide run ‘deeper’ than those of a physical one, as 
the former continues unabated in the present. Their argument is indeed tied 
to the identity crisis, hence the recurrent pleas for self-​determination. A great 
deal of Khoisan revivalists share these views. It is quite common to charac­
terize the colonialization of the Khoisan as having particularly devastating 
effects. One Khoisan revivalist informed a reporter from News24 that ‘[w]‌e lost 
too much to even try to explain –​ our land, our livestock, our culture, language, 
way of life, our heritage sites and historic landmarks, our forefathers’ farms,

our identity and our first-​nation status’.6 Basil Coetzee (25/​04/​2018; 13/​12/​2018) 
also reasoned that the Khoi and San are ‘the worst affected because our coloni­
zation trajectory took centuries […] 180 years ago colonialism started for other 
African groups. Our culture was removed long time ago, theirs preserved in 
the homeland system’. Many others shared this perspective on homelands and 
what they meant for the preservation of Bantu identity and culture (en 2012d, 
9; enn 2014j, 9).
The reasoning behind the cultural genocide argument bespeaks the afore­
mentioned tension between continuity and change as it concomitantly 
confirms and dismisses the (in)authenticity of Khoisan revivalism. Mellet’s 
comments about Van Sitters’ authenticity are a case in point. Referring to a 
process of cultural genocide is used to dispute any purported lack of authen­
ticity by referring to systemic oppression, but it simultaneously acknowledges 
a certain degree of inauthenticity precisely because of that same oppression, 
which is moreover tied to arguments that Khoisan culture is under threat of 
extinction. This results in a complex dialogue with the Khoisan extinction dis­
course I expand on in Chapter 7. Then again, and this brings me to my final 
caveat, as I will show, certainly not all Khoisan revivalists are preoccupied with 
authenticity/​inauthenticity or endorse the cultural genocide argument, partic­
ularly if it is mobilized to compete with other groups over who suffered (and 
suffers) most. To some, the preponderance of questions surrounding authen­
ticity have faulty premises. I was made aware of this quite directly when the 
proprietor of a ‘first indigenous tea shop’ quipped ‘the revival is bullshit’ when 
I told him about the subject of my research. His popup shop was filled with 
bows and maps indicating the origins of his teas and their medicinal qualities. 
Pointing to these items, he explained how knowledge had been passed down 
for generations in his family. For him, there was no need to ‘revive’ anything, the 
mere presupposition was offensive to him. As I explained in the Introduction, 
despite the concept’s connotations to the contrary, I do not use ‘revival’ to 
name a process of bringing something back that is no longer there. In line with 
what I noted earlier, to me, it is better understood as a process straddling con­
tinuity and change. As the data in this chapter shows, it would be a mistake 
to reduce Khoisan revivalism to a slavish exercise in copy-​pasting from the 
past, or to presume that Khoisan revivalists are not aware of, or upfront about, 
the effects of historical change on Khoisan culture or the necessity to imagine 
what has been lost (see also Messelaar 2015, 23). As Mellet put it, most Khoisan

revivalists are aware that they are just as ‘impure’ as anyone else, and many 
also have a sense of humour and relativism about it. Other scholars who have 
engaged with Khoisan in Cape Town or elsewhere have come to similar con­
clusions (see e.g. Ellis 2014, 502; Øvernes 2019, 8). Basil Coetzee (25/​04/​2018) 
summed it up best: ‘It’s not recreating yourself, it’s actually creating who you 
are. You must create what was, we cannot recreate anything. It goes back too 
far’. These caveats need to be taken into account when surveying the revival of 
Khoisan identity and culture, which I turn to next.
6.1	
‘Like stepping into a time machine’
On International Indigenous People’s Day, 9 August 2017, a group of Khoisan 
revivalists led by Tania Kleinhans-​Cedras and Mackie gathered in front of the 
Castle of Good Hope to stage a protest. When I arrived at the scene, they were 
present with roughly 25 supporters, each holding up placards highlighting 
Khoisan-​related grievances. They were waiting for more people to show up, as 
the intent was to form an ‘Aboriginal Khoisan human chain’ around the Castle. 
Kleinhans-​Cedras had called on social media for Khoisan revivalists to turn out 
en masse to mark International Indigenous People’s Day and broadcast their 
plight to the media. While the first hour was relatively uneventful, eventually 
a couple of dozen people showed up and joined the protest. There were not 
enough people to achieve the human chain, but they spread out to take up as 
much space as possible. The group then coalesced around Mackie, who was 
standing in the middle of the road, chanting, dancing, and occasionally block­
ing traffic. For a brief moment he even laid flat on the ground. Together with 
Kleinhans-​Cedras in particular, Mackie railed against the Castle and the lega­
cies of colonialism it embodied, describing it as a ‘slaughterhouse’, the ‘home 
of the first paedophile’ (in reference to Jan van Riebeeck), and the place where 
Krotoa had suffered for decades. This went on for about half an hour, after 
which the group walked around the Castle, chanting along the way. They halted 
close to one of the walls of the Castle, where a number of homeless people had 
set up shelter. These people’s living conditions, it was argued, was the ultimate 
symbol of Khoisan marginalization: ‘their’ descendants ‘were forced to sleep’ 
outside this bastion of colonialism. As the protesters began sharing their griev­
ances while forming a ‘sacred circle’, which Mackie had prepared by removing 
rubbish from the grass, emotions ran high. Meanwhile, a small local media del­
egation had shown up and found many Khoisan revivalists were enthusiastic 
to have their pictures taken. The group dispersed shortly thereafter.

The bulk of the protesters were wearing at least some type of animal skin 
attire (see Figure 6), which certainly helped to draw attention from the media 
and other spectators. Clothing is indeed one of the most visual ways in which 
many Khoisan revivalists give expression to their identities. For Mackie, it is 
vital to his Khoisan revivalism:
When I have my aboriginal indigenous dress on, my vellekies [skins], I 
notice people staring at me, people want to touch it, they see it is real skin 
[…] I wear skins that look like that of leopards, but it is not really from 
them as they are endangered animals […] I feel different when I wear the 
skin. I act different. It is a form of remembrance; maybe not exactly like it 
was, but close enough, like stepping in a time machine […] When people 
laugh at me when I wear these clothes I tell them they have a colonialist 
mind-​set. They get angry, but then we get into a discussion and it blows 
their mind.

Chapter 6
Mackie indeed almost seems to ‘go somewhere else’ when he reaches 
fever pitch protesting, making a speech, or engaging in ritual activities (see 
below). The time machine metaphor captures why and how many Khoisan 
revivalists (do not) engage with Khoisan identity and culture. In many ways, 
Mackie refuses to partake in the game of authenticity by acknowledging that 
his clothes are not ‘really’ made from leopard skin. In fact, he uses the authen­
ticity/​inauthenticity of his regalia to provoke a discussion about Khoisan 
revivalism more generally and to debunk ‘a colonialist mind-​set’. Having said 
that, the role of Khoisan traditional clothing, however defined, is certainly 
debated. For Vanessa Ludwig (19/​08/​2019), ‘just because we are not looking 
the way Khoisan are depicted, it does not mean we have no connection to 
them. It is not about walking around with skins and things like that, but 
about what you do to change realities on the ground’. Joseph Little (08/​05/​
2018), who was one of the first in Cape Town to flaunt a leopard-​motif ‘kaross 
[mantle]’, also recognized that clothes in themselves do not prove anything. 
Another interlocutor remarked that while going about ‘half-​naked’ did not 
help Khoisan revivalism’s public image, ‘the feathers do not make the bird’ 
and people should be free to wear whatever they want (Peter Marais, 02/​07/​
2018). The British did not have to dress ‘like Vikings’, so why would they. Aaron 
Messelaar (16/​03/​2018) did not understand why some wore these types of 
garments either, if the Khoisan ‘already stopped wearing animal skins in the 
17th century’. For him, wearing animal skins often represented an opportu­
nistic ‘shortcut’ to authenticity, through clothes that were possibly ‘bought 
at the airport curio shop’. Others also feared that people dress in a certain 
way because they believe it makes them more ‘pure’ or ‘credible’ as Khoisan 
revivalists (Bradley van Reenen, 11/​05/​2018). For William Langeveldt (27/​03/​
2018), on the other hand, to debate clothing at all is absurd: ‘Many people 
say I will not wear vellekies [skins], so I tell them “your jackets, bags, etc. are 
also made of leather, what’s the difference?” Why is one normal and not the 
other?’ Yvette Abrahams rejected any correlation between Khoisan identity 
and clothes on a similar basis:
When I was at university many anthropologists told me it was impossible 
that I was a Khoi-​woman, just because I had not walked around in animals 
skins and ran about in the desert. The relevance of being a Khoisan is how 
you live your daily life. Are you honest and sincere? Do you respect God in 
everyone? This is how you know you are a Khoi. Whether you are wearing

jeans or a piece of skin does not matter because being Khoi is not about 
how you look, but how you act.
en 2009c, 157
While different opinions about Khoisan traditional clothing circulate, the vast 
majority of my interlocutors possessed some type of garment or ornament, 
whether a headband, a set of beads, porcupine quills, or a wooden stick. 
Though not seen as proof of one’s Khoisan identity, they become meaningful 
attributes in the articulation of their indigeneity all the same. As Basil Coetzee 
explains, there is a time and place for Khoi culture:
If I put on skins I am suddenly a Khoi? Nonsense. I do not need to con­
vince you […] It’s not my appearance, it’s inside […] Of course, for a 
ceremony I might consider it. If we put a show about Krotoa in 1654 we 
would put historical clothing, but to go to the mall with traditional attire; 
in what context are you doing that? It means you are a slave of imagery, 
to stereotypes […] When media came to interview me I put on my beads, 
which tells you I am from a Khoi identity group, that’s all. I do not put on 
my gown, that’s for ceremonies.
basil coetzee, 25/​04/​2018
Not everyone is as meticulous about which facets of Khoisan culture are appropri­
ate for which occasions. Some consider this a problem and have called for a large-​
scale gathering to clarify and codify traditional protocols and rituals (enn 2014j, 
12). It strikes me that most do not share these concerns, however, and instead draw 
on various markers of indigeneity as ‘time machines’ that are only partially based 
on their claim to authenticity or purported historical provenance. In relation to 
clothing, this might account for the frequent appearance of shirts with rock art 
motives: the shirt itself is not meant to be ‘authentic’, but the reference certainly is, 
giving the one wearing it an embodied connection to Khoisan culture as well as a 
way to aesthetically assert the presence of the past. It might also be an additional 
reason why my attempts to find out more about the origins, composition, and 
specific meanings of types of clothing or cultural attributes were regularly met

with little enthusiasm or avoided all together (see above). I give numerous other 
examples of this throughout this chapter and revisit this hypothesis from a theo­
retical vantage point in Chapter 7. For now, notwithstanding the methodological 
limits I laid out in the beginning of this chapter, I make the point also in relation 
to certain practices that are deemed to represent Khoisan historical traditions by 
the people involved. I have triaged these according to fieldwork-​induced themes. 
The first section focuses on the role of plants, rituals, and the ‘North’ as sources of 
inspiration. In the second section, I focus on tourism, artistic engagements with 
Khoisan culture, and the revival of Khoekhoegowab.
6.1.1	
Plants, Rituals, and Inspiration from the North
No one made me question the role and use of ‘authenticity’ in Khoisan reviv­
alism more than Yvette Abrahams. Much of this is probably owed to her wit 
in handling researchers like myself. At least, that is how I experienced my day 
with her at her farm in Gordon’s Bay, an hours’ drive from Cape Town (Yvette 
Abrahams, 16/​07/​2019). As some of her statements in this book might have 
already suggested, ‘authenticity’ is at once crucial and entirely irrelevant for 
Abrahams. She discards the notion if it is deployed as a touchstone to validate/​
invalidate acts of Khoisan revivalism. Herself an academic, though not affili­
ated to a university at the time, she is at her best when pointing out the ironies 
and ambiguities of academic enquiry in this regard. At our first meeting I had 
a sense that she was feeling me out by jokingly asking me ‘so, you are studying 
me?’ and ‘is that how we are called these days?’, when I stumblingly tried to 
explain I was aware of the contestations surrounding the term ‘Khoisan’. As the 
above clipping from Eland Nuus shows, Abrahams indeed loves poking holes in 
overly-​intellectualized concepts and ideas, not least if tied to notions of authen­
ticity. At the same time, she made a point of adding that ‘if someone does want 
to talk about Khoisan culture, I have been studying and living it for years’:
I read the obsession with authenticity as a symbol of our oppression […] 
To whom is Khoisan culture problematic? It is not our jobs to make sense 
to academics who want to put us in boxes. Those boxes, we have to ques­
tion them. It is about how one makes culture. When people say I am not 
doing Khoisan culture I challenge them, tell me what it is and what it is 
not? […] When I began to self-​identity as Khoisan it was like the labora­
tory animal speaking back.

The irony of me using this citation to reluctantly ‘box’ Abrahams in a certain 
analytical frame does not escape me, as she was also fond of pointing out. As

she argued, there is more to learn about Khoisan revivalism by looking at how 
‘one makes culture’. Fittingly, she made these comments as she was preparing 
a batch of soap: ‘The Khoisan have been making soap for centuries. I wanted 
to do it authentically so I looked for the materials they used back then to recre­
ate it. Much I had to reconstruct by myself, of course’ (ibid.). Aside from soap, 
her company, Khoelife, which she started in 2013, offers a range of health and 
beauty products, ranging from body lotions and shampoo, to creams to rem­
edy arthritis and washing powders. All ‘organic, natural, carbon neutral, hand­
made, cooked on solar power & biogas. Vegan friendly & not tested on animals’. 
The website clarifies the origins of Khoelife and philosophy behind it:
Khoelife came about because Yvette’s health problem, Psoriasis (a skin 
disease usually marked by red scaly patches) […] the Psoriasis continued 
to trouble her, despite the use of Western Medicine. The KhoeSan survived 
for centuries without modern medicine and used buchu for a number of 
ailments […] With her indigenous knowledge, Yvette began experiment­
ing on herself and cured the Psoriasis […] the demand grew for the buchu 
products and this was the beginning of the Khoelife business.8
Abrahams’ Khoisan revivalism is indeed intrinsically linked to plants (see also 
Abrahams 2014). As she explained that day on the farm, she went from an ini­
tial interest in plants, to encountering them in the sources, to studying botany 
to able to harvest them herself and harnass their medicinal qualities:
I realized I could not speak the language, but I could speak plant very 
well, that’s what my mother taught me, gardening and working on the 
land. I had bought the farm in 2006 because I needed space to cultivate 
all those plants I had been reading about. Many plants fell out of use so I 
had to go and find them all around to reconstruct that 18th century ecol­
ogy here.
yvette abrahams, 16/​07/​2019
Abrahams thus scrutinizes historical sources and conducts ethnographic field­
work among those who are knowledgeable about the plants she is looking for. 
She describes this as a ‘practical form of decolonization’ as it involves bringing 
back plants that are no longer in use to create a ‘living library of knowledge’ as 
well as a ‘sustainable eco-​system’ in the face of climate change: ‘I had a PhD,

but in an indigenous sense I was totally illiterate so I walked with old ladies 
and they taught me so many things’ (ibid.). Abrahams pursues this in large part 
through her engagements with the historical figure of Sarah Baartman, whose 
life she studied in her PhD dissertation: ‘I moved more from the academic to 
the practical side of things […] I am just trying to be my authentic self in the 
course of writing about Saartjie Baartman’. This meant that, rather than writ­
ing a biography, she looked for a medium Baartman herself would have under­
stood as ‘history’: ‘I wanted this book to see the world through Auntie Sarah’s 
eyes […] Well, here I am; I am busy developing the biography –​ except it is not a 
book at all. It is a garden’ (Abrahams 2011, 38). Abrahams (16/​07/​2019) reasoned 
that ‘Auntie Sarah’ would not have written a book herself but would have opted 
for ‘a garden’. The ‘biography’ is currently located in her backyard, but she 
always had the ambition of planting ‘a walking museum of indigenous plants 
and products’, a ‘time machine’ where one could engage with ‘what Baartman 
wore, what she ate, what her hairstyle was etc. […] Not a word would have to 
be said, you could walk around and get a sensory experience’.
Abrahams has been involved with the Department of Arts and Culture 
since the funeral of Sarah Baartman in 2002 to set up the ‘Sarah Baartman 
Legacy Project Memorial Garden’ as part of the ‘Sarah Baartman Centre for 
Remembrance’ in Hankey in the Eastern Cape (Abrahams 2011, 40–​41). The 
original design included land for farming and the grazing of cattle ‘so that 
the plants can once again thrive like they should’, as well as vacant land ‘for 
the people to roam and wander as the KhoeSan did of old’. Also envisioned 
was ‘a site for learning and research on indigenous knowledge systems, arts, 
and crafts’. In 2009, the then Minister of Arts and Culture communicated that 
a ‘a solemn tree-​planting ceremony’ had taken place to mark the beginning of 
the construction process (Jordan 2009). He also added that a research centre 
would be constructed to ‘uncover the hidden aspects of Khoekhoe indigenous 
knowledge […] and audit cures, medicinal plants and other indigenous spe­
cies’, to ultimately ‘feed back […] the heritage, the history and the culture of 
the Khoekhoe and San […] into the broader South African community’. More 
details on the Sarah Baartman Legacy Project Memorial Garden emerged in 
2014, when the South African government announced construction had finally 
begun in earnest after the plans for the site had been finalized.9 It was decided 
that the entire complex will consist of a ‘secular portion and the sacred por­
tion’. The former will house administrative offices and classrooms, as well as a

‘language laboratory’ and ‘artwork depicting Khoi and San dialects’. The ‘sacred’ 
portion will comprise the ‘Sarah Baartman Museum’ and a connected ‘Khoisan 
Museum’, replete with a ‘Genocide Wall with inscriptions of all Khoisan geno­
cides’ and a commemorative ‘Genocide Pond’. This Pond will be flanked by a 
‘Healing Pond’, which is placed on route to Baartman’s resting place. Abrahams’ 
trademark garden will also be located on the premises, which will also func­
tion as a place to explain ‘myths and legends’. After almost two decades, the 
project is reportedly nearing completion (Chirume 2019).
Before moving on to the next topic, I should stress that Abrahams is by 
far not the only one for whom plants feature heavily in their Khoisan reviv­
alism. Jeremy Klaasen, an Associate Professor at the Department of Medical 
Bioscience at uwc became involved with Khoisan revivalism in the wake of 
studying a specific type of fungus that is native to Namaqualand during his 
PhD research (Jeremy Klaasen, 12/​04/​2018). This blossomed into a broader 
interest in ethnobotany, indigenous knowledge, ethno medicine, and, indeed, 
Khoisan identity and culture. Klaasen is currently linking specific species 
of plants to their historical geographic boundaries to assist certain Khoisan 
collectives with their campaigns for intellectual property rights. During my 
fieldwork, I also encountered references to the ‘bush doctors’, who are hawk­
ing indigenous herbs and medicines at several locations around Cape Town 
(see also Philander et al. 2014, 304). The non-​profit organization ‘Cape Bush 
Doctors/​Kaapse Bossiedokters’ strives to unite these ‘indigenous healers’ 
in the Western Cape and campaign on their behalf for greater protection of 
their harvesting practices and rights to sell their services and products.10 The 
organization also aims to have the Bush Doctors officially join the Traditional 
Healers Council. But these are just some additional examples of the ways in 
which plants feature in Khoisan revivalism, more of which are also apparent 
below. To some extent, however, plants remained a blind spot throughout my 
fieldwork, and more research is required to appraise their role and meaning in 
Khoisan revivalism.
This point also to some extent applies to the ancient ritual known as the 
!Nau, as I did not examine the subject in-​depth or claim to have understood 
its varied meanings for Khoisan revivalists. Having said that, arguably no other 
practice is valued more as an authentic Khoisan tradition by Khoisan reviv­
alists than the !Nau. As I noted in Chapter 3, the first to carry out !Nau cere­
monies in a Khoisan revivalist setting was the group associated with Joseph 
Little and Daniel Kanyiles, who used the rituals to induct chiefs into the Cape

cchdc and other bodies that sought to rally Khoisan traditional leadership. 
Michael Besten gives a description of the !Nau that was carried out by the col­
lective in Oudtshoorn in June 2000:
Preparations for the induction ceremony began at midnight […] with the 
cleansing of a ‘holy kraal’ and the slaughter of a ram […] Kanyiles led 
those who were to be sworn in into a special kraal […] The feet of the 
inductees were dipped in blood in a sink container. The inductees then 
moved in circles in the kraal. Their feet were afterwards washed with 
water. Boegoe-​water (herbal-​water) was then placed on their tongues fol­
lowed by honey. The final step in the ritual was an oath of loyalty. Those 
inducted were then led out and introduced to awaiting ‘tribe’ members 
as new ‘tribal’ chiefs and council members […] The footprints left in the 
kraal by the blood-​dipped feet of inductees symbolized a blood-​print 
supposedly running through history and the connection of humans with 
the earth giving life to everyone. The walk in circles in the kraal symbol­
ized the Khoekhoe’s nomadic existence and the different paths that cross 
in life.

While Little is no longer at the forefront of Cape Town-​based Khoisan revival­
ism, he still carries out !Nau ceremonies roughly twenty years later. I was invited 
to such an occasion at the Castle of Good Hope on 28 July 2019, where a series 
of chiefs were sworn into Little’s Chainouqua tribe. A makeshift kraal made 
out of reeds was erected in the centre of one of the building’s courtyards, but 
only those undergoing the ceremony were allowed to see and venture inside. It 
was reportedly the first !Nau carried out inside the Castle. On this occasion too, 
a sheep that been ‘fasting for one day’ was slaughtered and its blood gathered 
in a small hole in the ground for inductees to dip their feet in. People lined up 
to undergo the ritual and affirm their commitment to the ‘Khoisan struggle’ 
and the Chainouqua House. As one of the men involved in conducting the cer­
emony explained, people step inside the kraal wearing their everyday clothes, 
but emerge with ‘cultural attire’ to symbolize their transformation –​ bringing 
Mackie’s time machine metaphor to mind. Once all new chiefs were inducted, 
they were given a certificate with their name, id number, and Little’s signature 
testifying they had been traditionally sworn in. As the ‘paramount chief’ who 
succeeded Kanyiles, who assumed this role in the National Council of Khoi 
Chiefs (nckc) until he passed away, Little stressed that he was the only one fit 
to oversee a !Nau (see Chapter 3). The notion that only someone in that posi­
tion can carry out the ceremony is also shared by others who were involved

in the early days of Khoisan revivalism, such as Basil Coetzee (25/​04/​2018). To 
him, the fact that so many are carrying out !Nau ceremonies shows a lack of 
respect for protocol.
Many indeed seem to organize !Nau ceremonies without Little’s blessing or 
oversight. The first !Nau I attended was such an occasion. I was given permis­
sion by the leadership of Khoisan Kingdom to attend the ‘!Nau of affirmation’ 
on 27 September 2014 in Botriver, about an hour’s drive from central Cape 
Town (see also Verbuyst 2015, 117–​118). Zenzile Khoisan was in charge of the 
ceremony and urged me to take pictures and approach anyone for informa­
tion. Roughly 100 people were present, but only a fifth or so underwent the 
actual !Nau. As was the case with Little’s !Nau, a kraal was fashioned out of 
reeds and covered with leaves so as to make it virtually impossible to discern 
what was happening inside. At the beginning of the ritual, Zenzile explained 
that participants committed themselves to the ‘Khoisan struggle’, some by 
becoming ‘chief’. One by one, the inductees were called forth and asked to 
take off their shoes and clean their feet with buchu water, which had also been 
used to cleanse the kraal itself. Buchu is a fynbos herb and used as a remedy 
in Khoisan traditional medicine (Low 2007). As they entered inside they were 
asked to dip their feet into a small puddle of blood, which stemmed from a 
sheep that was slaughtered for the occasion. This was to symbolize walking 
in the footsteps of the ancestors (see above). They were asked by the master 
of ceremony to state whether they identified as Khoisan, to salute ‘Khoisan 
heroes’, and to swear to uphold ‘traditional values and customs’. Upon comple­
tion, participants received a set of beads and, if applicable, their new title was 
proclaimed to the audience. After this part of the !Nau was concluded, Ron 
Martin, who was coordinating the ceremony together with Zenzile Khoisan, 
held a set of kudu horns up above his head and then placed them back on the 
ground, something which I commonly encountered in Khoisan revivalist set­
tings (see also enn 2014c, 7). Martin explained that the horns symbolized how 
Khoisan revivalists could unite: the ends of the horns were sharp and pointed 
to opposing directions, but they originated from the same ‘base’. In that space 
of hollowed out skull, renosterbos [rhinoceros bush] and khoigoed [imphepho, 
Hottentotskooigoed or liquorice plant] were burned inside an abalone shell to 
resolve differences of opinions (see also enn 2014i, 15). As soon as one had 
entered the kraal, they were also asked to leave all strife behind at the entrance. 
After the !Nau concluded, a seafood potjie [stew] was served and various more 
light-​hearted activities took place, such as a hip hop performance by local 
youth and various other musical items (see below).
On 27 June 2014, the same group carried out a ‘!Nau of dedication’ near Oude 
Molen, where Ruben Richards along with others were inducted and affirmed

their commitment to Khoisan revivalism (enn 2014f, 1; see Conclusion). 
Members of the Gorinhaiqua Cultural Council explained in enn (2016b, 8–​9) 
that the !Nau had to be carried out ‘soos in die oertyd [as in ancient times]’ 
when there was a new moon, a condition that was also met at the time of the 
!Nau in Botriver and the one of Joseph Little (enn 2014f, 15). The new moon 
symbolizes ‘new beginnings and renewal’, as captured in enn’s description of 
the event at Oude Molen:
At the rising of the new moon, a new chapter was written in Khoi history, 
with leaders who came to embrace their indigenous culture and prac­
tice that carried their ancestors through the centuries, even under the 
most brutal conditions […] As the moon took to its path, with the scent 
of Khoigoed and lavender burning sweetly, fires lighting the perimeter a 
blessed night brought the clans together, a spirit of renewal seemed to 
[have been] reached.
enn 2014f, 3
The enn report (2014f, 1) added that the inductees thus underwent their ‘first’ 
!Nau. Indeed, while the ritual as practiced in Khoisan revivalist settings is com­
monly associated with publicly ‘authenticating’ leadership, pleading allegiance 
to Khoisan revivalism and affirming ‘a sense of community’ (De Wet 2010b, 60; 
Brown and Deumert 2017, 589), it also serves other purposes. Many see it as a 
rite of passage. As an article in enn spells out, some hold that there are in fact 
seven !Nau’s in this regard:
For indigenous people everything is interconnected […] has a bigger and 
deeper meaning, a flowing rhythm connects everything we do and every­
where we found ourselves in every phase of our life. For the indigenous 
Khoi and Bushmen-​people of our country this is called the !Nau –​ the 
dance of life with its different phases, experiences and responsibilities 
[…] This starts with birth; life changes brought about by puberty; adult­
hood; followed by the responsibility of the man, woman and family; the 
phase of tribal-​ or national identity; followed by tribal or national respon­
sibilities and lastly there is the final !Nau, our return to the earth, to our 
Creator, and this is mostly a very spiritual process.

In Tears of the Praying Mantis, Basil Coetzee (2019b, 168) similarly describes 
the !Nau as an ‘ancient ritual’ that ‘plays a very decisive role in the life progres­
sions of all Khoi peoples’ and consists of ‘seven rites of passage that end with 
the death of the human being and the return of the physical body to the earth’. 
The funeral !Nau in particular is considered significant. Several articles in enn 
are devoted to ‘indigenous funerals’ (see e.g. enn 2014i, 4; 2014j, 1). As one of 
these explains, buchu is important here as well, both to clean the grave site 
and to escort the dead during their ‘final !Nau’ (enn 2013c, 14). The burning 
of Khoigoed further serves to accompany the departed so that their ‘siel lig en 
vreedsaam kan vlieg deur die heelal en ons herinneringe an hom/​haar mooi kan 
bly [soul can roam the universe in peace and our memories of him/​her remain 
unspoiled]’ (enn 2016b, 8). It is also common to break the bow and beads of 
the deceased to indicate that their fight has been concluded.
Funerals and the swearing in of Khoisan revivalist(s) (chiefs) are the two 
contexts that are most commonly associated with the !Nau in Khoisan reviv­
alism, but there are also other uses. Bradley van Sitters for instance describes 
the !Nau as a ‘cultural thanks-​giving ceremony’ (enn 2014c, 1). During her field­
work among people living on the streets of Cape Town who asserted a Khoisan 
identity, Siv Øvernes (2019, 122, 143) noticed that the !Nau was an occasion for 
her interlocutors to share food with each other. This signified that the ritual 
not only functioned to cultivate a sense of Khoisan ‘belonging’ but that it also 
offered ‘a sacred space in the midst of a harsh reality’ by acting as a reminder 
of the importance of sharing so that no one has to go hungry. I certainly do not 
claim to comprehend the various meanings of the !Nau for my interlocutors. In 
fact, as I noted at the beginning of this chapter, I try to be mindful of my lim­
itations in this regard. However, I elaborated on the descriptions of the varied 
interpretations of the !Nau to showcase the diverse roles it fulfils for Khoisan 
revivalists, as well as the materials they draw on in the process. Despite this 
diversity and differences in choreography, the !Nau always clearly functions as 
an explicit manifestation of Khoisan identity, which brings to mind William 
Ellis’ observation about one mode of Khoisan traditional leadership being in 
large part about the ability to credibly and creatively channel Khoisan cultural 
practices as a ‘ritual specialist’:
land word dit die !Nau genoem –​ die dans van die lewe met sy verskillende fases, ervarings 
en verantweordelikhede […] Dit begin met die geboorte; die lewensverandering wat puberteit 
bring; mondigwording; gevolg deur die verantwoordelikheid van die man, vrou en gesin; die 
fase van stam-​ ofvolksidentiteit; gevolg deur stam ofvolks-​verantwoordbaarheid en uiteinde­
lik is daar die laaste !Nau, ons terugkeer na die aarde, na ons Skepper, en dit is veral ‘n baie 
geestelike proses’.

Chapter 6
[Ritual specialists] are those that attempt to reproduce the cosmolog­
ical world of the Khoi and San by deploying readily available symbols 
and artefacts associated with KhoiSan identity, and recombining them 
in a creative process in order to recall or recreate a world that was lost 
in the colonial encounter […] The individuals who lead these rituals are 
called upon to lead because they are seen as having the knowledge to 
rediscover the lost world of the KhoiSan by successfully deploying the 
available symbols.
ellis 2019, 312
The ‘ritual specialist’ does not aspire to ‘accuracy’ per se but rather credibility 
and, above all else, relevancy for his peers and followers. This, however, does not 
mean that the materials and practices that make up Khoisan revivalist articu­
lations of indigeneity are sourced randomly. Here too a pattern emerges that 
lays bare the constant tension between continuity and change (see Chapter 7). 
Although Chantal Revell (07/​03/​2018) does not believe in the existence of 
unspoiled authenticity, she holds that there should be an emphasis on ‘original 
principles’, a position that echoes her views on Khoisan traditional leadership 
(see Chapter 5). She reasons that adhering to these ‘principles’ would remove 
the need to ‘get bits and pieces from all over’ and stop ‘our history from dying’. 
Revell is convinced that the answers are found with ‘old people […] outside of 
Cape Town […] Because for us in Cape Town, everything to do with tradition 
was like witchcraft’. Aaron Messelaar was similarly motivated to record tradi­
tional Griqua culture in Forgotten but not buried in light of the fact that ‘custo­
dians of the culture who strive to keep the Griqua culture alive are busy dying 
out […] most of the elders have already passed on’ (Messelaar 2015, vi, 31). It is 
crucial that the younger generation in particular should understand that ‘their 
culture is not dead’ (ibid., 90). To this end he went back to his native Campbell 
in the Northern Cape to conduct fieldwork. As I showed in Chapter 3, many 
Khoisan revivalists undertook similar trips to areas that are commonly con­
sidered unspoiled or less tainted reservoirs of Khoisan culture due to their 
relatively shorter and different experiences of colonialism (see also Verbuyst 
2016, 85–​86). Once more the time machine metaphor shows its relevance: geo­
graphical remoteness from the epicentre of colonialism connotes ancientness 
and authenticity. Considering the historical progression of the colonial fron­
tier, this argument is not without merit and indeed also exists in other coun­
tries with histories of settler colonialism (see e.g. Gibson 2012, 211; Cooke 2016). 
Then again, it does mark a parallel with anthropologists working in the tradi­
tion of salvage anthropology (see Chapter 2) –​ a complex relationship I revisit 
in the next chapter. Suffice it to say that much of the inspiration for Khoisan

revivalism is indeed sourced from the Kalahari and northern areas, a case 
in point being the matjieshuise [traditional dwellings in the Northern Cape] 
that are erected at Khoisan revivalist events (see also Davison and Klinghardt 
1997, 186) or Mackie and others’ insistence that they learned about the !Nau 
as a result of their upbringing in Namaqualand or visits to the Northern Cape 
(Mackie, 08/​01/​2015).12
When I explained that my research was looking into Khoisan revivalism in 
Cape Town, many people in South Africa (and elsewhere) responded by urging 
me to plan a visit to the Northern Cape to get a ‘different’ picture. It is import­
ant to note that a difference between the Khoi and the San is often asserted 
here. For reasons I mentioned in Chapter 2, the San are frequently considered 
to be less assimilated than the Khoi. Khoisan revivalists tend to downplay 
these differences and emphasize what they have in common instead. And 
yet, as Michael Besten (2006, 309) has observed, the difference is somewhat 
asserted in more subtle ways as well, by capitalizing on the ‘ultra-​indigeneity’ 
of the San and their associations with a pristine hunting and gathering lifestyle 
(see also De Wet 2010, 10). These markers of indigeneity, he points out, could 
be used to make up for the supposed lack of authenticity of Cape Town-​based 
Khoisan revivalists. Chantal Revell (09/​08/​2017) noted that not all San appre­
ciate that Khoisan revivalists associate themselves with them as this waters 
down their own attempts to sketch an indigenous ideal type, an issue that was 
already present during the earliest engagements between Khoisan revivalists 
and the San in the lead up to the 1997 Khoisan Identities and Cultural Heritage 
Conference (Watt and Kowal 2019, 65; see Chapter 2). Some San reportedly 
consider Khoisan revivalists as less ‘pure’ or ‘not-​indigenous’ because of their 
history of assimilation and alleged greater degree of genetic intermixture 
(Chantal Revell, 07/​03/​2018; 19/​08/​2019). Under apartheid, many distanced 
themselves from the San because they were emphasizing their European roots. 
As Revell pointed out, it is ironic that the tables have now turned with many 
San seeking to avoid any association with Capetonians (see also Comaroff and 
Comaroff 2009, 96). Besten therefore certainly has a point in commenting on 
the political nature of their relationship.
I would add, however, that appealling to the San serves other purposes as 
well. The San are viewed favourably by some Khoisan revivalists as role models 
for supposedly being more close to nature and in touch with their identities, 
	12	
Interestingly, as I noted in the Introduction, Siv Øvernes (2019, 230) observed that her 
interlocutors in Cape Town often referenced the Karoo area that spans the Eastern, 
Northern, and Western Cape Provinces in this regard, a reference that was largely absent 
among the people I interacted with.

Chapter 6
once again resulting in complex articulations with salvage anthropology and 
the noble savage trope in particular, Berte Van Wyk (2014, 19, 23) for instance 
wrote that they are ‘perhaps the most profound human beings on earth who 
believe that nature has a spiritual and a symbolic relationship with them’. 
Another interlocutor once showed me a brief fragment from The Gods Must be 
Crazy on his smartphone (see Chapter 2). The scene in question always made 
him tear up as it showed a father being reunited with his son and crying tears 
of joy. He wanted people in Cape Town to embody a similar type of father­
hood, which he felt was currently lacking in Coloured communities (see also 
Langeveldt 2012, 24). Basil Coetzee (25/​04/​2018) also shaped his Khoisan reviv­
alism in large part through his interactions with the San, though in more direct 
and long-​term ways. As I explained in Chapter 3, his upbringing, career, and 
stint in the military made it possible for him to travel across Southern Africa 
and interact with Khoisan communities in various locales. He lived for a year 
with the !Kung in Northern Namibia, immersing himself in their way of life. 
Coetzee drew on these experiences when we visited !Khwa ttu, ‘the ‘embassy’ 
of the San of southern Africa’, located in Yzerfontein, about 70–​80km from 
Cape Town.13 As an educational and cultural institution partially owned by the 
San, since 1999 !Khwa ttu had been training and employing San to ‘tell their 
own stories’ through the museum and the guided tours (see also Wildschut 
2007, 549). Together with his wife and my partner, we took one of those guided 
tours during our visit. At a certain point, we halted at a location where a couple 
of dwellings were set up. The guide imparted some ‘secret knowledge’ about 
a local plant (which I cannot divulge here for it would no longer be secret) 
and showed us how to make fire with a few pieces of locally-​sourced wood. 
As Coetzee was chatting to the guide, he half-​jokingly asked if it was possible 
for us to stay overnight in the huts (see Figure 7). He was fully aware of the 
fact that !Khwa ttu was a recreation. This was no naïve attempt at manufactur­
ing authenticity. It is rather that he felt the experience could have given us an 
approximation of San culture. If the request had been granted, the huts could 
perhaps have functioned as ‘time machines’ for the night.

Tourism, Mending the ‘Broken String’, and Reviving Khoekhoegowab
Tourism is a controversial topic for Khoisan revivalists. Scholars have argued 
that many tourist enterprises advance static conceptions of Khoisan culture, 
perpetuate stereotypical conceptions of the Khoisan, or embody paternalistic 
attitudes towards them by operating under the flag of conservationism (see

e.g. White 1995, 13; Mogalakwe and Nyamnjoh 2017, 8; Boonzaaier and Wels 
2018, 184–​185). Khoisan revivalists have also put forward similar critiques. An 
anonymous letter published in enn in 2014 for instance took aim at southa­
frica.net, South Africa’s official tourism website, for reportedly mourning the 
Khoisan’s ‘extinction’ (enn 2014h, 8). More common is the charge that tourism 
in general perpetuates, rather than debunks, assumptions about Khoisan cul­
ture as static. June Bam-​Hutchison, Bradley van Sitters, and Bongani Ndhlovu 
(2018, 175) note that the ‘pre-​colonial’ is not taken seriously as a result, with 
‘indigenous partners […] relegated to “song and dance” activities in public pro­
grammes’. One of her interlocutors was even allegedly told to get his ‘leopard 
skin and dance, and do some Khoi clicks when the tourists arrive’. I too was 
once asked by a Dutch documentary maker if I had some contacts he could 
interview on camera, with the caveat that they ‘of course, had to be photoge­
nic’ and ‘look the part’. For Yvette Abrahams (16/​07/​2019), these types of per­
ceptions are stymieing a more open-​minded view of Khoisan revivalism: ‘Of 
course cultures grow and change so it would be the worst offence to Khoisan to 
expect us to remain fossilized in one moment in time’. As she put in Eland Nuus 
(2009c, 15): ‘People think we need to live in the past to be Khoisan […] Growth 
and change are a very important part of the Khoi-​culture […] The Khoi have 
adapted things and grew and transformed’.14

Chapter 6
Together with economic incentives, it is precisely a drive to do things dif­
ferently, or at least on their own terms, that makes Khoisan revivalists want to 
have their own tourism ventures. While such initiatives have been announced 
in Cape Town at various points in time –​ at Hangberg and Princess Vlei, for 
instance –​ little has materialized to date (enn 2014c, 1; see also Bam 2014, 
130; Mama 2011). Chantal Revell (07/​03/​2018) desires to purchase a piece of 
land ‘and put up a kraal to preserve the culture, which is busy dying out’. 
Jonathan Muller (10/​04/​2018), who works as a tour guide for a local company, 
also dreams of having his own business one day. The potential for Khoisan 
revivalist-​operated initiatives is great as ‘we are poor in terms of money, but 
rich in terms of heritage’. While Muller had been aware of his Khoisan roots 
because he regularly visited his family in Upington in the Northern Cape as 
a child, he particularly became interested in them in 1999, when he began to 
scout for potential sites to create tourist initiatives. While ‘North’ provides his 
main reference point for Khoisan authenticity, he does not believe one neces­
sarily has to travel great distances from Cape Town to look for it: ‘Already a few 
hours outside of Cape Town we see signs of indigenous culture, even further 
North in Namibia there are other examples […] In that sense, connecting with 
that culture is not as impossible as people say’. Tourism is Muller’s passion 
because, unlike the politics of Khoisan traditional leadership, which he is sus­
picious of, the potential to reach people is immense:
I try to keep authentic culture alive. When I ask people today why they 
are Khoi, they need to be able to tell me about their beliefs about the 
land, spiritual beliefs, etc. […] You need to tell me what sets us apart. We 
need to begin focussing on culture and customs. Those messages need to 
get out there […] We need to get it to schools and the youth in particular.

Lucelle Campbell has established Transcendental History Tours in 2009 to pur­
sue a similar objective with regards to the city of Cape Town. Lucelle’s ‘journey’ 
began in 1988, when she was working in marketing at the Groot Constantia 
Museum, located on the famous Groot Constantia vineyard on the slopes of 
Table Mountain (Lucelle Campbell, 11/​07/​2018). At some point in time, she 
picked up a magazine about the estate’s history, which triggered an interest 
into the history of slavery in Cape Town. After studying at the University of 
Cape Town and uwc, Lucelle began working at Iziko Museums, which gave 
her additional opportunities to explore her passion. This historical knowl­
edge helped process the ‘intergenerational trauma’ that people like her were 
left with after the dispossession and disruptions of colonialism. Experiencing

Reviving Khoisan Culture

this type of healing inspired Lucelle to organize her own ‘personalized’ tours, 
where she guides tourists to places in Cape Town that embody various trau­
matic legacies: an effort she describes as ‘decolonizing’ (enn 2017b, 7). Just as 
this experience proves therapeutic to her, she hopes ‘lifting the veil of shame’ 
will help heal the wounds of others as they explore and confront the city from 
a new angle (Campb ell 2014; Khoisan 2015b). I participated in a walking tour 
which Lucelle catered with an associate of hers on 25 June 2018. The guided 
tour aimed to give a basic history of Cape Town but primarily seen through 
the lens of the Khoisan and the enslaved. Her commentary had strong Khoisan 
revivalist overtones, as she and her fellow guide constantly stressed the inter­
relatedness of past and present and emphasized the importance of being able 
to tell their ‘own stories’. A key theme was uncovering ‘invisible’ colonial leg­
acies. This invisibility extended not only to seemingly uneventful places but 
also to more conspicuous places such as museums, which the guides noted 
still housed hundreds of bones from the ‘indigenous people’. Another stop was 
the Castle of Good Hope, where Lucelle explained the crucial role of Doman in 
resisting colonialism and how his story, and particularly those of female resis­
tance fighters, had regrettably been forgotten. Through her actions, Lucelle 
was ‘reclaiming space’ in Cape Town (see also Amoamo 2011, 1266).
I have at this stage already mentioned the Castle numerous times. While it is 
a site of major importance for Cape Town-​based Khoisan revivalists’ opinions 
about it differ. Some want to demolish it (see above), but most see ways of 
appropriating the building to advance Khoisan revivalism and create ‘a counter 
narrative within the space […] by counter-​curating the castle as a site of mem­
ory’ (Bam-​Hutchison 2016, 24, original emphasis; see also Bam, Van Sitters and 
Ndhlovu 2018, 162–​169). For years, William Langeveldt has been campaigning 
to turn the ‘Stone-​Kraal’ into a ‘Place of Love and Indigenous Healing’ and the 
headquarters of the nkc, or a newly created ‘Ministry of Indigenous Affairs’ 
(enn 2013b, 1; 2014b, 7; 2014g, 14; 2014k, 6). His plans for a reimagined Castle 
are quite elaborate and involve, among other things, renaming the ‘5 colo­
nial bastions after the 5 first indigenous nations’, creating ‘storage facilities 
for organic food production’ and using the roofs to generate solar and wind 
energy (Langeveldt 2016, 80). Those in charge of managing the Castle have 
been actively encouraging such new ideas for about a decade, and a process is

Dutch did not build the castle, the Khoisan and slaves did’ (see also enn 2014h,

Chapter 6
One of my main objectives is to transform the Castle into a living heritage 
space and position it as a place of education, healing, reconciliation and 
understanding […] It is time that a true reflection of our crossed paths 
be showcased in the space where it was real in history. We will achieve 
this by showcasing the importance of every role player in the history of 
the Castle and showing how today and in the future all these conflicting 
cultures and communities can thrive in unity […] On a practical level, 
this vision will be activated through the showcasing of the past, present 
and future of the Cape and its people. Not just looking back but looking 
forward.

While Gilfellan highlights unity and shared narratives, the emphasis in prac­
tice, and for historical reasons, is mostly on the Khoisan. He for instance 
brought the unwritten rule into being that Khoisan revivalists are free to use 
parts of the Castle for meetings or ritual practices, which they regularly do. 
Gilfellan has also supported various initiatives more directly. In 2016, to cel­
ebrate 350 years of the Castle’s existence (see Chapter 4), a ‘Khoi-​khoi Village 
Scene’ was erected in front of the complex: ‘a new exhibition celebrating the 
journey, culture, heritage, and aspirations of the first indigenous people’ (enn 
2016a, 15). Ron Martin, who was involved in setting up the exhibition, gave 
more details in his contribution in enn:
[T]‌he KhoiSan kraal retains all the elements of authenticity. This means 
that the covering for the huts were both in the form of hessian cloth and 
the scarce reed mats, which were added to the structure and tied down 
with natural twine or sisal rope […] Other elements include the tradi­
tional pit-​fire, cooking pots and utensils […] supplemented by day-​to-​day 
utensils, including the digging sticks, bows, arrows, quivers, hand-​axes, 
flakes, adzes, knives and pottery. There are also natural elements such 
as ostrich eggs, skin bags, calabashes, ceremonial horns and musical 
instruments.

this end he also drew a map of Africa in the sand and clarified for the 
youth how important it is to understand their own history and back­
ground. This formed the background for the youth to take pictures of 
themselves after the day’s events concluded.

Martin, who has an extensive background in heritage (see Chapter 3), has been 
involved in various similar activities aimed at educating young people about 
(their) Khoisan identity. An interesting program in this regard was the Aba Te 
initiative, launched at the Castle in August 2015 as a ‘fun, yet uniquely compre­
hensive triple-​treat of Khoe-​khoe language, culture and heritage’ for people 
of all ages (enn 2015, 10). Martin was in charge of the ‘history and heritage 
component’ and explained in enn that Aba Te effectively amounted to a safe 
space to discuss Khoisan identity and culture: ‘It is indeed a unique opportu­
nity to be able to debate the true history of our forefathers freely, without fear 
of being ridiculed by ‘established’ academia, in a friendly, safe environment’. 
Aside from history lessons, also on offer were educative and creative sessions 
covering art, plants, spirituality, and medicinal practices. Aba Te also featured 
Collin Meyer, who showcased the musical, therapeutic, and cultural qualities 
of the ‘KhoeSan Mouth Bow […] reputedly the oldest percussion instrument’. 
He presided over the ‘Bow-​making and Playing facilitation workshops’. The fact 
that the bow is often only thought of as a hunting tool ‘is an indication of the 
cultural genocide of Khoe cultural systems’, Meyer argued.
Garth Erasmus is one of the first to mainstream the (mouth) bow as a musi­
cal instrumental. He grew up in the Eastern Cape, surrounded by ‘a wealth of 
folklore’, but moved to Cape Town in the mid-​1980s, where he became a ‘cul­
tural worker’ in the anti-​apartheid art scene (Garth Erasmus, 18/​03/​2018). Julie 
McGee (2008, 122–​123) has written about his transformation in some detail. 
She explains how his interest in Khoisan instruments stems from a visit to the 
South African Museum in Cape Town in the early 1980s, where he encountered 
a display featuring a body cast of a Khoisan boy playing a bow as a musical 
instrument, which was meant as an illustration of musical practices among 
the San in the Kalahari. Erasmus became curious about what the bow would

sound like and decided to replicate the musical instrument at home. Around 
1985, he finished his first musical bow, which had a calabash attached to it to 
function as a resonator, not unlike the Brazilian berimbau. Erasmus often refers 
to the ‘broken string’ metaphor, which stems from one of the stories captured 
in the Bleek and Lloyd archive (see Chapter 2), to explain the disruption that 
colonialism brought to bear on the Khoisan (Adhikari 2011, 94). Erasmus sees 
his work as literally ‘mending the broken string’ and communicating with his 
indigenous past through the vibrations of the instrument (McGee 2008, 123). 
The bow, in a sense, equally transformed into a time machine. Indeed, while 
striving for authenticity, his ‘artistic archeology’ takes the metaphor fully on 
board as it does not seek to emulate ‘an extinct historical past’ but embraces 
what he describes as the ‘indigenous now’:
[Garth Erasmus] sources and excavates [Western perceptions of Khoisan 
culture] to find connections to the very culture othered by Western 
engagements with Africa. Herein lies the difference, subtle perhaps, but 
keen […] Erasmus borrows liberally from Khoi and San cultural resources 
and their contemporary symbolic potential matters more than marking 
their archeologic time as ‘the past’ […] For Erasmus, indigenous heri­
tage provides material necessary for a creative healing process, a way of 
deconstructing colonial and apartheid identities embedded in racial con­
cepts, and restoring personal, national, and African dignity […] Erasmus’ 
use of Khoisan culture is a personally recuperative one, not a modernist 
salvage mission (ibid., 120, 128–​129).
Playing the bow and engaging with Khoisan identity and culture more gen­
erally is indeed therapeutic for Erasmus. One of the reasons he was drawn to 
the bow in the first place was because he no longer found inspiration in the 
political motifs that characterized Cape Town’s anti-​apartheid art scene (Garth 
Erasmus, 24/​04/​2018). While he tends to avoid the political side of Khoisan 
revivalism for the same reasons, he certainly sympathizes with many of its 
tenets. The 1510 defeat of D’Almeida or the 19th century Kat River Settlement 
are sources of inspiration for him (Garth Erasmus, 18/​03/​2018). Erasmus (13/​
04/​2018) believes he has been fortunate to access academic materials to draw 
on for inspiration with the help of his network. This also assists his efforts to 
make ‘a philosophical connection to something that is not there anymore […] 
The disconnect becomes the strength of my work, I expose the facts of our 
dispossession up to the point we have to reinvent things’ (Garth Erasmus, 18/​
03/​2018). This effort is both personal and collective, as Erasmus made clear

when explaining that, in order to play the bow, the bow faces and aims at the 
one playing it:
Turning it around becomes a metaphor, turning it at yourself and focus­
sing on the inside […] I needed to be ‘shot’, I needed this internal awak­
ening […] Everybody in South Africa is traumatized […] Healing needs 
to go to root issues, we are not going back in trauma deep enough. The 
Coloured identity crisis is too simplified, self-​discovery is the key and the 
artist works to ensure dignity […] That means acknowledging that we 
are cut from history, that it is a mess, not pretending we are not. A !Nau 
is a way into identity crisis, not out of it […] acknowledging that you are 
trying to make a connection to something that has disappeared […] The 
music brings this healing and I was hunting for music (ibid., 18/​03/​2018).
Armed with this Khoisan revivalist philosophy, Erasmus has been successfully 
‘hunting for music’ in South Africa and abroad, including via other mediums 
such as visual art and performance. He created Khoi Konexxion in 1999 together 
with two other likeminded artists he met in the poetry music scene, Jethro 
Louw and Glen Arendse (Garth Erasmus, 13/​04/​2018). While Erasmus (18/​03/​
2018) explains that the collective had to go against the grain because it was 
initially ‘side-​lined culturally’, they quickly became well-​known in Khoisan 
revivalist circles. Khoi Konexxion for instance performed as the airplane car­
rying the remains of Sarah Baartman landed in 2002 (Henry Bredekamp, 11/​
12/​2018). They released their first album in 2009, Kalahari Waits, which one 
reviewer in Eland Nuus described as ‘full of creative ways to play music’ (en 
2009b, 16). It indeed features a wide range of indigenous instruments, mostly 
from South Africa. Jethro Louw, who is a locally renowned spoken word artist 
who has long been involved with Khoisan revivalism (see below), provides 
most of the vocals. Louw overlays many of the tracks with Khoisan revivalist 
themes, mentioning the need for the ‘awakening of the slumbering Hottentot’ 
in Morning Sky and stressing the fact that ‘Khoisan descendants are in a state 
of spiritual confusion’ in On the Edge, for instance. I come back to the topic of 
music in the next subchapter. What I wish to add here is that Khoi Konexxion 
has also organized various workshops. These partly consists of bow-​making 
workshops in the style offered during the Aba Te program, the proceeds of 
which went to local underserviced communities. Another set of activities are 
more directly involved in those communities and involve teaching children 
how to fashion musical instruments such as the ‘bliksnaar [improvised gui­
tar]’ out of locally sourced recyclable materials (Garth Erasmus, 24/​04/​2018). 
As Erasmus explained, this is both a way to help clean up polluted areas as

well as to bring healing and a sense of pride in Khoisan identity among the 
youth: ‘people see the bow and they get excited […] they sense there is a con­
nection there’.
This brings me back to the Aba Te program and more specifically to its lan­
guage module, which was coordinated by Bradley van Sitters.16 The word Aba 
Te ‘literally means “carry me” in the ancient Khoekhoegowab language’ and aptly 
reflects the motives of its language component (enn 2015, 10). The idea was to 
teach young people in particular to read, write, and speak Khoekhoegowab so 
that they could in turn become ‘ambassadors’ for the language and carry it over 
to future generations. It is important to recall that colonialism and apartheid’s 
assimilationist policies actively supressed Khoisan languages (cf. enn 2013c, 
15; Bam-​Hutchison 2016, 22). As Van Sitters explained in an article for enn, 
however, remnants of Khoisan languages are discernible in the English and 
Afrikaans (and other languages) that are spoken in South Africa (see below). 
This point is also made by others, such as Basil Coetzee, who gave the examples 
of saying ‘tss’ to chase someone away, which is ‘a Khoi click’, and ‘Eina’ when 
you are hurt, which is also a ‘Khoi word’ (Basil Coetzee, 25/​04/​2018). Tanyan 
Gradwell (31/​07/​2019) likewise explained that the Afrikaans word ‘gam’, used 
to disparingly refer to a gangster or a thief, dates back to the way of referring 
to the /​Xam, a Khoisan subgroup in a derogatory manner during colonialism.17 
Yet, despite Khoekhoegowab’s (assumed) influence on Afrikaans or English, it 
is not widely spoken in South Africa, except for areas in the Northern Cape. 
As I noted in the Introduction, Khoekhoegowab is a standardized version of 
Nama, so it is still in moderate use in Namibia, where Van Sitters also pursued 
his studies and continues to source teaching materials from (cf. Du Plessis 
2019, 34; Brown and Deumert 2017, 582). To help promote Khoekhoegowab in 
South Africa, particularly as a language of instruction in schools, Van Sitters 
and others, notably Pedro Dâusab, have been ardently campaigning to have 
it recognized as an official language alongside the eleven others currently 
with that status.18 The specifics of this campaign fall outside the scope of this 
	16	
I should flag here that the role of Khoekhoegowab in Khoisan revivalism is far more com­
plex than what my commentary might suggest. Justin Brown, who co-​authored a pioneer­
ing article about Khoisan revivalism and Khoekhoegowab (Brown and Deumert 2017), is at 
the time of writing in the process of finishing his PhD thesis on the topic at the University 
of Cape Town.

It should be noted that ‘gam’ or gamtaal not only refers to criminals, but that it is a deroga­
tory way of referring to Coloureds in general and the specific dialect that is spoken among 
Coloureds in Cape Town (see Van Heerden 2016).

book (see Brown and Deumert 2017). Suffice it to say that while it has not yet 
achieved its goals, Khoekhoegowab has received increased attention from the 
Pan-​South African Language Board, which announced in 2011 it was funding 
an initiative to translate the Khoekhoegowab-​English dictionary into Afrikaans 
(see enn 2017b, 2). Another noteworthy milestone is the University of Cape 
Town’s decision in 2019 to offer both a Khoekhoegowab course and eventually 
install it as a fourth language of instruction (Swingler 2019; Van Dieman 2019; 
see Conclusion). Van Sitters has also recently joined as faculty.
Van Sitters has certainly come a long way from his language classes at the 
Castle of Good Hope. As I noted in the Introduction, I attended these weekly 
classes for a while in 2015. It is unclear exactly how long he had been organiz­
ing these, but they seem to have taken place on and off, depending in large 
part on overcoming practical and financial hurdles. Van Sitters did not charge 
a fee for the classes as he wanted as many people as possible to learn basic 
Khoekhoegowab. There were usually half a dozen students attending his classes 
but frequently many more. What I take away from these gatherings was not just 
Van Sitters’ patience and his passion for the language but also the easy-​going 
dynamic he cultivated in his classroom. The classes were not designed to cram 
as much knowledge as possible into the students but to offer them a chance to 
learn at their own pace. While many certainly came to study Khoekhoegowab 
in-​depth, which also accounts for the circulation of academic texts on the topic 
on social media, it is my impression that most attended to interact with the 
language itself in the first place. Speaking a basic set of words, talking about 
the language’s history and about Khoisan identity and culture more broadly 
during the weekly classes were acts of Khoisan revivalism first and foremost. 
I have made this observation on various other occasions as well, where I inter­
preted the speaking of Khoekhoegowab as a way of summoning authenticity. 
The mere act of engaging with Khoekhoegowab itself provided a gateway to 
Khoisan identity and culture, independent of one’s actual command of the 
language. Justin Brown and Ana Deumert (2017, 588) came to a similar conclu­
sion, noting that what sets Khoisan revivalism apart as a ‘language revitaliza­
tion movement’ is ‘the commitment to diversity and the absence of policing 
cultural-​linguistic expression’:
the need to ‘promote, and create conditions for, the development and use of’ Khoisan 
languages under Chapter 1, Section 6, Subsection 5. While Khoisan languages are sin­
gled out in this manner, presumably because they face a greater threat of dying out, the 
Constitution places them under the rubric of ‘indigenous’ alongside other languages that 
are spoken in the country, but not as an official language.

Chapter 6
The importance of language […] as a core marker of indigenous authen­
ticity, seems uncontested among Khoisan activists; yet the question of 
‘how much language’ is desired and/​or necessary remains refreshingly 
open […] [E]‌valuations of revitalization programs often focus narrowly 
on the acquisition of linguistic competence, and tend to forget pragmatic, 
cultural, phatic, poetic as well as metalinguistic competencies. The latter 
aspects have been the focus of Khoisan language activism in Cape Town, 
an activism which is not only political but also artistic-​aesthetic, cele­
brating language form rather than simply promoting its use.
ibid., 582, 591
‘Celebrating’ Khoekhoegowab in this respect is often ascribed therapeutic qual­
ities; for instance, by William Langeveldt, who speaks of ‘Geestelike Genesing 
deur Moedertaal Opvoeding [psychological healing through education in the 
mother tongue]’ (Langeveldt 2012, 35). As I noted in Chapter 1, the fact that 
I knew how to greet someone in Khoekhoegowab was often seen as a sign of 
respect, even leading one interlocutor to frequently introduce me as someone 
who ‘speaks our language’, despite my continuous clarifications that I only knew 
a handful of words and phrases. And yet, a handful is more than nil, which to 
many suffices as basic qualifications for Khoisan revivalism. Often times, the 
same slogans and chants in Khoekhoegowab are voiced seemingly independent 
of the occasion. The click sounds in particular seem to get crowds eager to 
participate, as Van Sitters proved during his praise singing at Parliament. As 
Brown and Deumert (2017, 585) put it, ‘the articulation of clicks is almost mag­
ical at times, evoking ancestral roots even in the absence of fluency’. Certain 
translations of key texts or slogans are highly evocative in this regard, such 
as ‘toa tama:khams ge [the struggle continues]’ (see Chapter 4) or the Lord’s 
Prayer (enn 2013b, 15; 2014c, 7; 2017a, 14). As I show in the next subchapter, 
where I shift the focus on acts of Khoisan revivalism where the emphasis is on 
innovation, Khoekhoegowab is not the only language at stake.

Most Coloureds speak Afrikaans as their mother tongue, making them the larg­

Kaaps, the dialect of Afrikaans spoken by Coloureds at the Cape, has however 
been castigated as impure and subjected to stigmatization for a long period of

[language of criminals]’ (cf. Carstens and Le Cordeur 2016; Becker 2017, 257). 
This has made Kaaps a highly political subject, and there have been various 
attempts to elevate it to a literary medium in its own right. This is a highly com­
plex topic, one that pertains far beyond Khoisan revivalism (see e.g. Carstens 
and Le Cordeur 2016). And yet, there has been a decisive push from Khoisan 
revivalists to reclaim Afrikaans as an ‘indigenous’ Khoisan language first and 
foremost (cf. Brown and Deumert 2017, 581). According to Tanyan Gradwell 
(31/​07/​2019), ‘Krotoa developed Afrikaans so that the Dutch could understand 
her’. In fact, she argues that much of what is deemed Afrikaner culture is in fact 
‘stolen’ from the Khoisan: ‘The Khoi made biltong [beef jerky] because they 
did not want to waste any piece of the meat […] Dried snoek [northern pike] 
as well, it’s not a Boer thing’. Mackie (05/​07/​2018) advanced a similar point of 
view, stating that ‘Afrikaans is not a White language, Khoisan people developed 
it to speak with the Dutch after they were forbidden to speak Khoekhoegowab’. 
In enn (2013c, 14), Willa Boezak likewise referred to the ‘KhoiSan grondleggers 
[Khoisan founders]’ of Afrikaans.
However, no other single performance to date sought to make this point 
more directly than the ‘hip-​hopera’ Afrikaaps, which was directed by Catherine 
Henegan, a South African expat in the Netherlands, and ran between 2010 and 
2015, both in South Africa and abroad. Most of the cast emanated from Cape 
Town’s hip hop scene, such as the aforementioned Blaqpearl (see Chapter 4) and 
Jethro Louw. Other performers include Emile Jansen, also known as ‘Emile yx?’, 
a member of the group Black Noise, which was one of the pioneers of the South 
African hip hop scene, and Quintin Goliath, also known as ‘Jitsvinger’, an equally 
prominent artist in Cape Town (Williams 2017; Becker 2017, 251). Afrikaaps’ main 
target is the notion that Afrikaans is the ‘language of the oppressor’ due to its com­
mon exclusive association with Whites and apartheid (Brown and Deumert 2017, 
583). Instead of Europe, Afrikaaps focused on its various African influences but 
the Khoisan in particular. The audience is asked if they are aware that the Khoisan 
were also responsible for the development of Afrikaans, after which the artists 
proceed with a historical overview of the language’s development (Becker 2017, 
245). Afrikaans emerges as the language of communication between colonizer 
and colonized. But it is also subversively ‘reclaimed’, for instance by pronounc­
ing words in Afrikaans with clicks (Brown and Deumert 2017, 585; see above). As 
Justin Brown and Ana Deumert (ibid., 583) observe, ‘[r]‌e-​imagining Afrikaans as 
a language that allows one to express indigenous authenticity and indigenous 
rights, rather than mimicking the voice of the master, is a radical move’. And yet, 
this embrace of hybridity while singling out the Khoisan leads Heike Becker (2017, 
258) to conclude that Afrikaaps ‘embrace[s] both the making and unmaking of 
difference as the paradoxical foundations of post-​apartheid belonging’.

Chapter 6
Another way to put it is that Afrikaaps has all the hallmarks of Khoisan reviv­
alism, as it deals not just with language but with Khoisan identity and culture 
more broadly. All of the artists involved have, to varying degrees, expressed 
their sympathy for Khoisan revivalism, before and after Afrikaaps, but the hip-​
hopera was arguably their most overt assertion.19 The typical Khoisan reviv­
alist emphasis on historical continuity suffuses the play. Large pictures of 
contemporary housing conditions on the Cape Flats are for instance regularly 
projected on the background alongside historical figures like Autshumato, 
colonial-​era prints, and depictions of slavery (ibid., 250). The link is also made 
more explicitly, particularly during the songs Ek Is [I am] and Kom Khoisan 
(Kry Terug Jou Land) [Come Khoisan, take back your land]. Except for the obvi­
ous political messaging of the title, the latter also contains other assertions of 
Khoisan indigeneity, such as ‘Go ask the Xhosa and the Zulu who was here first’ 
and ‘Bushmen and Hotnot were used to insult but everywhere the rock art still 
exists steadfastly for thousands of years’ (Schuster 2016, 48–​49). Emile yx? also 
alerts the crowd during this song that the Khoisan are no longer ‘asleep or tired’ 
and willing to accept their stereotypical portrayal, which is explicitly called out 
in reference to the movie The Gods Must Be Crazy (ibid., 50; see Chapter 2).
Afrikaaps is a particularly successful exponent of a wider trend of Khoisan 
revivalist articulations of indigeneity in relation to hip hop subculture (see also 
Amoamo 2011, 1266). The ancientness of the Khoisan remains part of the artic­
ulation, but the difference with the examples in the previous subchapter is 
that the emphasis here is not so much on continuity with the past, but on pre­
senting Khoisan identity in conjunction with various contemporary cultural 
influences. The examples in this subchapter equally count as acts of Khoisan 
revivalism, however, as they are articulations of Khoisan indigeneity all the 
same, the main difference being that they explicitly embrace a certain degree 
of reinvention or ‘change’. There might well be other subcultures that are rele­
vant here. Although I encountered it less among my network of interlocutors, 
Rastafarianism certainly comes to mind. Many Rastafarians indeed seem to 
have found common cause with Khoisan revivalists, suggesting various points 
of overlap with the subculture, which became popular among Coloured youths 
after the end of apartheid (cf. Järvenpää 2015, 123–​124; Brown and Deumert 
2017, 578; Sato 2018, 205–​206; see also Chawane 2012). There is a specific over­
lap between Rastafarianism and the Cape Bush doctors (see above), evident in

Emile yx? has for instance released numerous tracks with explicit Khoisan revivalist mes­
saging, such as I Am a Bushman (Afro Centric, 2018), Boesman Daans (Kaapste Katte, 2018), 
Ek ‘s ‘N Boesman (Kaapse Katte, 2018), and various tracks on Songs and Stories for My Son 
(2017).

the prominence of dreadlocks, as well as an emerging discourse of psycholog­
ical liberation, herbs (predominantly dagga [cannabis]), and Khoisan ances­
try (Philander 2010,118–​122; 2011, 579). More research is needed to explore how 
Khoisan revivalism and Rastafarianism have touchpoints in Cape Town. Hip-​
hop did frequently feature during my fieldwork, however, perhaps because it 
is especially popular among Coloureds.20 Another reason might be because 
hip hop in the Cape Flats originated as a reaction to the alienation and urban 
dislocation of forced removals, experiences that were related to the plight 
of African Americans (Yarwood 2006, 163–​166). In Cape Town, as elsewhere, 
social commentary and activism has thus been engrained in hip hop culture 
from the start.
An interesting example in this regard is the artist Kirk Krotz from Mitchells 
Plain, who I briefly mentioned in Chapter 4. In an article for News24 (2013), 
Krotz reflects on the success of his hit The Good and the Bad, which he released 
under the pseudonym The Boesman Project in 2013.21 The Good and the Bad is 
a reflection on Krotz’ love-​hate relationship with Mitchells Plain and the fact 
that Cape Town is at once ‘the most beautiful city in the world. The most dan­
gerous city in the world’. Kortz explains how he was going to use the pseud­
onym Boesman, but was cautioned against it: ‘You are too talented to be called 
a Boesman’. This remark offended him, as he recently traced his family tree to 
the Khoisan in Namibia. Krotz’ family had always emphasized their German 
ancestry and believed that, as Coloureds, they had no real culture to speak of. 
Kortz himself was frequently mocked as a child for looking like a ‘Boesman’ and 
recalls how similar words were used as swearwords, including by Coloureds. 
When he was in high school, he encountered a more positive interpretation of 
the Khoisan as a result of the revised post-​apartheid history curriculum, which 
in turn set him on a path towards embracing his Khoisan roots. While not going 
for the more ‘radical’ move of calling himself Boesman, he chose The Boesman 
Project to signal his Khoisan revivalism and assert his Khoisan identity. More

Certainly, there is also a great deal more to say about hip hop and Khoisan revivalism. 
After all, I have not focused on it during my research or carried out an in-​depth analysis 
of the sources. Those looking into the topic might find inspiration in the work of Itunu 
Bodunrin, who has carried out ethnographic research on hip hop cultures among the 
!Xun and Khwe in Platfontein in the Northern Cape (Bodunrin 2018; 2020).

specifically, not unlike what African-​American hip hop did with regards to the 
‘n-​word’, artists like Krotz or Emile yx? are using the subversive qualities of 
hip hop to recuperate words such as Boesman and Hotnot as positive markers 
of identity.
There are other, less explicitly activist, facets of hip hop culture which 
make it chime well with Khoisan revivalism. One episode from my field­
work stands out in this regard, an event billed as ‘Taking Hip-​hop Back To 
Its Roots’, organized by Khoisan Revival Holistic Development (krhd) on 17 
December 2018 (see Figure 8). The event’s principal organizer, Nolan Berry 
(18/​12/​2018), explained the underlying philosophy of krhd and the event in 
question during an interview. Berry traces his Khoisan revivalism to 2013/​2014, 
when he was invited to help set up a Khoisan political party, a project that 
never really took off. He joined the initiative for a while and got ‘educated’ 
about the Khoisan in the process. After the book was recommended to him 
by a professor at Stellenbosch University, he only referred to using the pseud­
onym ‘Krotoa’, Nolan read Ruben Richards’ Bastaards or Humans to deepen 
his interests in the Khoisan. Bastaards or Humans opened his eyes to the fact 
that ‘history does not teach us much about who we really are because history 
was written by our oppressors’. Berry also began to warm up to the identity 
crisis thesis, believing there is a need to teach youths in particular about ‘the 
spirit of the Khoisan, the way they lived, shared with one another and lived in 
harmony with the environment’. He contrasted this idyllic way of life with the 
harsh living conditions on the Cape Flats, ‘where a life means nothing’. ‘To me’, 
Berry concluded, ‘Khoisan revival is about living a purpose-​driven life’. This 
made him establish krhd in 2018 with his own and his wife’s savings, as ‘many 
people are complaining, but few are actually doing something’. He deliberately 
opted for an apolitical body, as he felt politics did little to advance ‘culture’. As 
the name suggests, krhd aims to counter the identity crisis with a ‘holistic 
consciousness’: ranging from abandoning drugs and fast-​food, to embracing 
discipline and respect for the environment. One of its activities involves going 
to the beach and cleaning up the surroundings, followed by martial arts classes, 
fire-​making, and nature walks, in order to get youths ‘out of the concrete jungle 
prison’ –​ all free of charge.
‘Taking Hip-​hop Back To Its Roots’ was all about drawing parallels between 
the Khoisan and various facets of hip hop culture. The celebration took place 
on the grounds of Rocklands stadium. The loading dock of the local cantina 
was refashioned into a podium and a large flag featured in the background –​ 
the cover picture of this book. A local traditional leader briefly spoke about 
indigenous rights in his opening speech, but after that all performances were 
of a less political nature. Beatboxers, break-​dancers, karate practitioners, and

rappers all took turns showing off their skills. Basil Coetzee had joined me at 
the event and also took to the stage for a couple of minutes to read some of his 
poetry. The various speakers all alluded to the identity crisis by making state­
ments such as ‘Ons is Khoisan [we are Khoisan!]’ and ‘Ons mense ken hulle roots 
nie [our people do not know their roots]’. What is interesting to note is that 
Nolan Berry himself is not ‘into hip hop’ but chose to ‘use anything to achieve 
[his] objective’ since the subculture was tremendously popular among young 
people; making it an ideal vessel to promote Khoisan revivalism (Nolan Berry, 
18/​12/​2018). By all estimations that goal was certainly reached, with kids tak­
ing the occasional break from playing soccer in the nearby field to line up and 
have the logo ‘Khoisan Revival’ spray-​painted on their t-​shirts by local graffiti 
artist Rizah Potgieter, who also designed the flag. Many of them also partook 
in the graffiti workshop that was organized behind the building, where kids 
(and a clumsy researcher) were taught how to paint Khoisan revivalist mes­
sages, such as ‘//​Hui !Gaeb’ or ‘Tita ge a Khoe [I am a Khoi]’, on large pieces 
of white cloth that were draped over the fence (see Figure 9). As one of the 
artists was marking the kids’ t-​shirts, I noticed some other children perusing 
a worn-​out book that ‘has been a major source of inspiration’ to him. It was 
a thick collection of Khoisan rock art illustrations, but I could not make out 
the title of the book. Contemporary graffiti culture is indeed frequently lik­
ened to the rock art of the Khoisan. For Jonathan Muller (10/​04/​2018), the fact 
that ‘our people love graffiti’ was a form of 21st century rock art, a sign that 
Khoisan identity and culture endured, though perhaps in a different guise. 
One artist from the Cape Flats thus summed up the links between hip hop 
and the Khoisan quite succinctly:
Hip hop has come full circle at present. Emcees are like the storytellers of 
the tribe, graffiti is cave paintings and the drums of Africa are like turn­
tables, this is our ideology. We talk about the Khoi-​San. I’m sorry, but we 
are sitting in the cradle of mankind, so why should we want to sound 
like Americans? Back in the day, if you’d told me that ‘you’re Bushman or 
you’re Khoi’, I’d have felt offended. But tell me now, man, and I’m proud.

Capitalizing on the success of the hip hop event, Nolan Berry (18/​12/​2018) 
contemplated a Khoisan-​themed beauty pageant, where participants would 
also be quizzed about Khoisan history. He abandoned this plan, however,

after ‘Krotoa’, his academic contact at Stellenbosch University, disabused him 
of it by convincing him it was a continuation of colonialist exhibitions of the 
Khoisan.23 Others did work with the idea of ‘Khoisan fashion’, however, and 
perhaps no other individual has done so more than Rochey Walters, who I men­
tioned in the Introduction. Walters was born and raised in the Eastern Cape, 
where he also founded his company Khoi Kulcha in 2013. It is only when he 
moved to Cape Town in 2018 to look for opportunities to grow his business that 
I got to know him personally. In many ways, Khoi Kulcha exemplifies a broader 
trend of marketing ethnicity in South Africa and beyond, which John and Jean

tional/​indigenous attire, and how well they could illustrate the background of the various 
Khoisan clans’.

Comaroff have described as ‘Ethnicity Inc.’ (Comaroff and Comaroff 2009; see 
also Schweitzer 2015; McNeill 2016; Steyn 2016; Sonnekus 2016). As I noted in 
the Introduction and elsewhere, various Khoisan commodities have seen the 
light of day and bear testimony to the commercial potential of Khoisan iden­
tity and culture. Khoi Kulcha is however not just trading on ethnicity; it is also 
an explicitly Khoisan revivalist-​oriented enterprise. Walters’ passion for the 
Khoisan is apparent in the way he explains the philosophy behind his com­
pany. The idea for Khoi Kulcha was born out of his shock that youths in his 
native Humansdorp in the Eastern Cape were either unaware of their Khoisan 
ancestry or scorned it (Rochey Walters, 18/​05/​2018). Walters left his job in 2010 
when he too realized he was largely clueless about the Khoisan at that point 
in time and that something had to be done to prevent ‘the heritage from dying 
out’: ‘What am I going to tell my kids? What is their heritage? I have Zulu and 
Xhosa friends, it’s amazing how they celebrate their culture’. Contemplating 
possible ways to corner this niche market, he realized he needed to come up 
with something that ‘will last for years, hundred years for now’:
The world evolved, people are not wearing skins anymore. So I said I am 
going to design a t-​shirt, something that looks cool, funky and attractive 
and people say I want to wear this […] You will not get a fashionable 
guy wearing skins, but you will get them wearing t-​shirts, they will still 
represent […] My thing is also anything positive will last. There are so 
many stereotypes about the Khoisan, so many things written that are not 
true […] people all over are claiming the land but nobody is interested in 
keeping the heritage alive and this is going to keep the heritage alive for 
years and years to come. A hundred years from now people will still wear 
clothes […] there might be Khoi Kulcha cars and cell phones one day.
rochey walters, 18/​05/​2018
Khoi Kulcha is in many ways Walters’ ‘time machine’ into the future, a way of 
guaranteeing that Khoisan culture will exist for generations to come. To be 
clear, he is an ardent supporter of acts of Khoisan revivalism that emphasize 
continuity as well. Walters (ibid.) sees an important role for what he regards 
as ‘authentic indigenous tradition’, evidenced for instance by his desire to one 
day ‘go to the Kalahari to experience how people live indigenous’ and essen­
tially engage in participant observation: ‘I want to put on animal skin, eat what 
they eat, do what they do etc.’. Walters’ Khoisan revivalism thus involves both 
efforts at creating continuity with the past and repackaging it in accordance 
with 21st century fashion trends. Moreover, while equally passionate about 
laying bare the violence of colonialism and its enduring legacies, he created

Khoi Kulcha in the first place to emphasize the beautiful, ‘cool’, and positive 
inherent in the ‘Khoisan story’; an appeal also made by various other Khoisan 
revivalists (enn 2017b, 7; Richards 2017, 535). Walters’ diverse motives are illus­
trated by his involvement in selling flavoured organic (ice)teas and exploring 
ways to expand with energy drinks brewed from ‘something the Khoisan ate 
to give them energy for weeks to hunt’ and even a Khoi lager (Rochey Walters, 
18/​05/​2018). The difference between Khoi Kulcha and companies like Yvette 
Abrahams’ Khoelife, however lies in the way they package Khoisan culture: one 
emphasizes time-​worn indigenous knowledge, the other contemporary fash­
ion. Walters’ brand ‘is not political as it does not harm anyone’, but that does 
not mean it is not concerned with Khoisan issues. Khoi Kulcha’s tea assortment 
is for instance sourced from ‘Khoisan-​owned’ tea plantations in the Cederberg 
region, as ‘Rooibos was discovered by the Khoisan’ (see Chapter 3). The tea 
packaging accordingly displays a Khoisan figure in rock art style, ‘to commem­
orate the first unknown Khoisan who discovered the process’ (Rochey Walters, 
18/​05/​2018).
Initially it was hard for Walters and his associates to get their products out 
there. He recalls facing ridicule for being involved with Khoisan issues and hav­
ing to go door-​to-​door to sell his products (Rochey Walters, 05/​12/​2018). Slowly 
Khoi Kulcha became financially viable, but he continues to reinvest the profits 
back into the company to make it grow (Rochey Walters, 18/​05/​2018). While 
the teas are sold at the supermarket chain Spar and shipped to various restau­
rants, Khoi Kulcha’s flagship product remains their t-​shirts and other apparel. 
Walters explains his company’s modest success by reasoning that he is not 
selling mere t-​shirts, but ‘stories’. These ‘stories’ more often than not explicitly 
embody Khoisan revivalist tropes, with messaging printed on clothing such as 
‘embrace your roots’ and ‘live original’, juxtaposed to all manner of Khoisan-​
related imagery such as rock art figures and hunting bows (see Figure 10). ‘Live 
original’ has become Khoi Kulcha’s motto: ‘the original slogan was ‘we are alive’, 
that kind of promotes a certain political element […] I am a creative person, 
I want to be original […] You do you and I do me […] Living original does not 
mean you have to wear an animal skin’ (Rochey Walters, 05/​12/​2018). Walters 
therefore actively encourages everyone to buy his products, whether they are 
Khoisan or not, as everyone should ‘live original’ and celebrate the Khoisan in 
the process.
Aside from running Khoi Kulcha, Walters also incorporates his Khoisan 
revivalism in his performances as a stand-​up comedian, musician, and activ­
ist, frequently all at the same time. This accounts for his involvement in the 
short-​lived unison-​initiative he launched with his long-​time friend Richard 
Burns and the locally renowned jazz musician Camillo Lombard. Replicating

various other initiatives seeking unity, unison attempted to unify all Khoisan 
representatives and get them to speak with one and the same voice, hence the 
reference to singing in unison. I attended the launch of unison in Mitchells 
Plain on 16 July 2018. Lombard chaired the meeting and gave a speech that 
emphasized how ‘we are all pragtige Khoi mense [beautiful Khoi people]’ 
seeking ‘self-​determination’ and greater promotion of Khoisan culture. Citing 
Ruben Richards’ book as a source of inspiration, he stressed that more peo­
ple needed to learn about historical figures such as Doman or Autshumato. 
Lombard also expressed his support for the campaign to rename Cape Town 
International Airport after Krotoa (see Chapter 4). He and the other unison 
members believed the Khoisan could rally around this message, but as I said, 
the initiative soon ran out of steam, thereby conforming to the trend I laid 
out in Chapter 5. However, during unison’s launch I also got more insight 
into Lombard’s fusion of Khoisan revivalism and music –​ which deserves to be 
elaborated on in light of this chapter’s focus.
At the meeting, Lombard pleaded for music-​themed ‘education programs’, 
where ‘youths learn about their true indigenous identity so that they realize 
who they really are as a first nation’. I do not know if these programs were 
ever rolled out, but Lombard himself underwent precisely such an evolution. 
Although he plays Khoisan traditional instruments such as the mouth bow, 
I would argue that he fronts them to a lesser extent in his productions than 
groups like Khoi Konexxion. Instead, Lombard explicitly aims for a blend of 
Khoisan revivalism, Khoisan traditional instruments, and jazz, particularly 
its Cape Town variety, Goema. Lombard is not alone in creating this flavour 
of fusion Cape jazz. The husband of the prominent Khoisan revivalist Tania 
Kleinhans-​Cedras, Tony Cedras, who is a locally acclaimed artist in his own 
right, for instance released Love Letter to Cape Town in 2015, which includes 
titles such as Autshumao Suite and //​Hui !Gaeb (Where the Clouds Gather). One 
reviewer describes the album as drawing out the ‘indigenous blood heart of 
Tony Cedras’ through its ‘soundscapes echoing the joyous resonations of origi­
nality from the ancient language of a First Peoples, the Khoisan’ (Martin 2015). 
With his band, Topdog sa, Lombard however seems to have reached an even 
bigger audience. Soon after the release of their debut album, Griqua dna, in 
2016, the band began organizing the Nama Jazz Series at Cape Town’s Artscape 
Theatre Centre on a yearly basis. As one journalist reviewing the 2018 edition, 
entitled This Is Who We Are, for Independent Online described it, the series 
takes the audience on ‘an indigenous journey’:
Nama Jazz, which pays musical homage to Khoi and San heroes, is a new 
term that has given the music unusual style and is a fusion of indigenous

melodies, rhythms and jazz chord progressions […] TopDog sa will use 
mouth bows, the Boesmans Klawier (African piano), the talking drum 
and rice shakers (instruments used by the Cape Khoena). These instru­
ments are the origins of their music, which links these indigenous instru­
ments to contemporary sounds such as the accordion, banjo, melodica 
and flute, all of which will feature in the performance.24
I attended the 2018 edition in Cape Town in April. The seats were all but sold 
out, and I was struck by the enthusiasm of the roughly 500-​strong audience 
as Lombard greeted them in Khoekhoegowab and exclaimed ‘we are the first 
nation’. During and in-​between performances, Lombard in particular echoed 
similar messaging, stressing that the time was ripe to tackle the identity crisis

by claiming indigenous status. He even plugged the book of Ruben Richards, 
‘the book that has all the answers’, which people lined up to buy in the lobby 
during the break. Richards was present to sign copies. In an interesting parallel 
to Afrikaaps, pictures of a man meant to represent Autshumato were projected 
in the background as the band performed Aushumao, which featured both bow 
music and a saxophone solo. The lyrics also bring home the Khoisan revivalist 
revision of history, by noting that ‘Aushumao is my regte naam’ [Aushumao 
[Autshumato] is my real name]. Other songs with similar themes include 
Krotoa, Origins, and Hoerikwaggo. The concert ended with Stam van Afrika 
[Tribe of Africa], with the chorus ‘Wie se kind is ik? Stam van Afrika. Wie se kind 
is ek? Wie se kind is ons? Wie se kind is jy? Khoisan, Griqua, Nama [Whose child 
am I? Tribe of Africa. Whose child am I? Whose children are we? Whose child 
are you? Khoisan, Griqua, Nama]’. Topdog sa officially launched their album 
Nama Jazz the next year, on 3 July 2019. At the launch, the artists explained 
that they had recorded an entire album previously but decided not to release 
it because it sounded ‘too foreign, too American’. As they began to ‘reconnect’ 
with their Khoisan ancestry, ‘inspiration flowed […] We all did research about 
who we are as a people, it was really intense […] this is who we are and the 
sound is in us’. This included a visit to ‘the archives’ and, as Lombard pointed 
out in an earlier interview, a fieldwork trip to !Khwa ttu.25 Several band mem­
bers, all of whom Coloured, attested that confronting the ‘identity crisis’ and 
discovering their ‘African root’ had been a ‘spiritual experience’. Playing music 
put them on the same ‘spiritual wavelength’, a shared sonic path towards 
Khoisan revivalism. The potential to get young people to be enthusiastic about 
their Khoisan roots was highlighted by Lombard, but also by several Khoisan 
revivalists who attended the launch. Khoisan culture was not only a power­
ful source of artistic inspiration. As with hip hop, the attendees recognized 
that Cape Jazz, and music more generally, was a powerful medium to amplify 
Khoisan revivalism’s reach.
One of the people Lombard and Topdog sa collaborate with in their per­
formances is Amanda Lois Stone, a local blues singer who has been involved 
with Khoisan revivalism for several years, though kept a more modest profile. 
Stone, who was born in Elsies River but grew up in Beaufort West, has become 
somewhat of a staple at Khoisan revivalist events (Amanda Lois Stone, 01/​04/​
2017). She traces her first ‘real thoughts’ about the Khoisan to a ‘vision’ she 
had in 2011 after coming across the poetry about Sarah Baartman by Diana

Ferrus. During the vision, Stone ‘could see the world through the eyes of Sarah 
Baartman [and] feel so much intense pain, but also a great love to get over 
the pain’. This inspired her to write poetry of her own, which she later added 
music to and began performing at local low-​key events. It is at one of these that 
she met Chantal Revell, who made her ‘realize I have an identity, culture and 
history’ and convinced her to become more involved in Khoisan revivalism. 
She has since adopted the stage name Khoi Noi [Khoi Lady] and has composed 
various songs in Afrikaans bearing witness to her newfound Khoisan identity. 
Stone’s performances draw on gospel and blues to ‘hit the soul’ and provide 
‘spiritual healing’. As with Topdog sa, her songs frequently embody Khoisan 
revivalist themes. In Krotoa, she sings from the point of view of Krotoa herself 
and asks her listeners to ‘bring tog my lewensvershaal aan die lig […] Ek, jy, ons 
is mos Afrikas eerste mense […] Ons testament nie op papier maar vir euwig op 
kliptafels rotswand [bring my life story to light […] Me, you, we are Africa’s first 
people […] Our testament not on paper, but forever on stone tables on rock 
walls]’. In David Stuurman, which celebrates Khoisan resistance fighter David 
Stuurman, Stone again takes the point of view of Stuurman and also explicitly 
advances land claims: ‘Moet my mense dan net in armoede verdywn? […] Ek vra 
maar net na Identiteits en grondves reg [Do my people simply have to disappear 
into poverty? […] I am merely asking for the right to identity and land]’.
Stone gets her inspiration from the various Khoisan revivalists she meets 
along the way, such as Camillo Lombard or Willa Boezak, who have shared 
their books and information with her (Amanda Lois Stone, 11/​04/​2018). Others 
have directly requested her to write songs about specific historical figures, 
as was the case with David Stuurman. During our last interview, Stone also 
mentioned that she was looking for funding to take a trip to the Kalahari to 
seek inspiration. She gets occasional financial support from fans, but she still 
struggles to get by. One of the ways Stone tries to raise funds is by organiz­
ing Khoisan-​themed events. I attended one of these on 29 June 2019 in Parow, 
billed as ‘Khoisan Winter Evening –​ come and experience a wonderful cultural 
jazz evening’. The evening was organized like a gala dinner and took place in 
a local museum known as the ‘Whalemark Building’ that doubles as a small-​
scale conference centre. Stone’s daughter acted as the host for the evening and 
set the tone by opening with ‘Khoisan brothers and sisters rise […] It’s time for 
our voices to be heard, that people know we are a nation of our own […] We are 
the bows and the clicks, the sounds and where the future begins […] Tonight 
is all about celebrating everything indigenous’. Khoisan-​themed objects such 
as ostrich shells, khoigoed, and kudu horns were placed around the podium, 
where various artists performed as the guests were served ‘traditional Khoisan 
food’. The artists provided the ‘bows, clicks and sounds’ mentioned earlier by

playing the bow (‘the indigenous sounds of South Africa’), reading their poetry, 
or performing their stand-​up comedy routines, which focused on Khoisan 
stereotypes.
It would not have been a celebration of Khoisan culture in true Khoisan 
revivalist-​fashion if the evening had not included the rieldans, a high-​octane 
social dance characterized by fast footwork and performed by men and women 
wearing farm-​style clothing (Arnolds 2016, 46; Nel 2016, 320). The host indeed 
revealed that local rieldans would feature as the closing act, performing ‘the 
oldest dance in the world’, as it is often referred to by Khoisan revivalists (see 
e.g. enn 2015, 1). The writer, teacher, and artist Elias Nel is accredited with its 
revival; he relates it to the Khoisan but also to farmworkers in general (enn 2015, 
2; Arnolds 2016, 84; Nel 2016, 318–​326). The origins of the dance are disputed. 
Some trace it to the 1940s and 1980s Northern Cape countryside (Van Wyk 2012, 
52). Most however argue that it grew organically out of a combination of indig­
enous dance forms from the Northern Cape and modern influences, including 
‘Scottish reel dancing’, hence its name (Van Wyk 2012, 52; Arnolds 2016, 46). 
Few believe it has survived unaltered in the present. Whatever the case may 
be, Nel danced the rieldans as a child in his native Verneukpan in the Northern 
Cape, but steadily saw it grow out of fashion (Arnolds 2016, 43). He approached 
the Afrikaanse Taal en Kultuurvereniging (atkv), a non-​governmental organ­
isation created in 1930 to promote Afrikaans language and culture, for assis­
tance in helping make it popular again. Eager to open up to non-​Whites after 
the end of apartheid, the atkv agreed to assist Nel in organising yearly com­
petitions in Paarl (ibid., 49). These have exceeded expectations and become 
incredibly popular, with only seven groups involved in 2006, to 96 in the 2015 
edition, and the dance being practiced in various other provinces in South 
Africa as well (Arnolds 2016, 53; Van Wyk 2013b, 148). Khoisan revivalists have 
been very enthusiastic about the increased popularity of the rieldans. One enn 
contributor saw it as a way to cherish indigenous knowledge and folklore in 
general (enn 2016b, 8). Others celebrated it as a sign that young people are 
warming up to their ‘indigenous identity’ (enn 2015, 1). Willa Boezak (2017b, 
337) even reasoned it would keep them off the streets and prevent them from 
losing themselves in ‘drugs and gangs’. Another interlocutor was confident that 
the rieldans will ultimately result in ‘young kids bringing the adults back in 
again’ (Jonathan Muller, 10/​04/​2018).
What is interesting to take away from the revival of the rieldans at the con­
clusion of this chapter is that it is has managed to become popular by a skilful 
navigation of the ‘continuity’ and ‘change’ I identified at the beginning of this 
chapter as being typical of the revival of Khoisan culture. By most accounts, the 
dance itself grew out of a fusion of new and old; yet it emerges as no less potent

Reviving Khoisan Culture

an act of Khoisan revivalism. In fact, rieldans has quickly become yet another 
core element of Khoisan revivalist culture, in no small part because it is now 
being promoted through atkv-​sponsored competitions. The involvement of 
the atkv shows how Khoisan revivalism, in all of its diversity, expands in ever 
new directions and continues to attract various partners (see Conclusion). 
Whichever directions Khoisan revivalism might take in years to come, I argue 
in the next chapter that important theoretical conclusions about indigenous 
revivalism, authenticity, and the uses of history can be drawn from the diver­
sity of empirical data I have presented up to this point.

­chapter 7
Khoisan Revivalism and the Therapeutics of Emic 
History
The historical conscience, through the feeling of cohesion that it 
creates, constitutes the safest and the most solid shield of cultural 
security for a people. This is why every people seeks only to know 
and to live their true history well, to transmit its memory to their 
descendants. The essential thing, for people, is to rediscover the 
thread that connects them to their most remote ancestral past. In 
the face of cultural aggression of all sorts, in the face of all disin­
tegrating factors of the outside world, the most efficient cultural 
weapon with which a people can arm itself is this feeling of histor­
ical continuity.

Today, we must utilise our past, how bad it may have been and 
exploit it to our own benefit. We must tell our own story, market 
and sing our own blues.

∵
Why and how do Khoisan revivalists engage with the past? This open-​ended 
question lies at the heart of my enquiry and has guided my fieldwork since 
2014. The empirical data I generated shows that Khoisan revivalists are driven 
by a wide range of motivations, which correspond to equally diverse articu­
lations of indigeneity. For Khoisan revivalists, ‘the past’ refers to historical 
legacies; personal and collective experiences, history books, museums, family 
trees, objects, and much, much more. This ‘past’ is engaged with to diagnose 
and remedy a felt identity crisis, inform and counter specific historical nar­
ratives, undergo religious and spiritual experiences, cultivate a sense of com­
munity, bolster entitlement claims, set up tourist ventures, tailor aesthetics,

Chapter 7
reconstitute Khoekhoegowab, and inspire rituals and artistic performances. 
This is a non-​exhaustive list, as the past undoubtedly has functions that I failed 
to identify. As Martin Engelbrecht, a Griqua representative, reminded those 
attending the Khoisan Identities and Cultural Heritage Conference in 1997, 
Khoisan revivalism above all else urges its adherents to ‘utilise’, ‘exploit’, and 
‘market’ the past to their ‘own benefit’. That much is indeed evident at this 
point. In this chapter, I revisit my central research question from a theoretical 
vantage point and examine why and how these types of emic histories pursue 
these ‘benefits’.
The diversity inherent in Khoisan revivalism offers several entry points 
for such an analysis. To my mind, however, a productive avenue is revealed 
in Engelbrecht’s reference to singing ‘our own blues’. I find it telling that 
Engelbrecht specifically mentions the blues musical genre. Indeed, when 
lamenting (the legacies of) dispossession and assimilation, Khoisan revival­
ists seem to experience the kind of melancholia that is also fostered in blues. 
They feel robbed of an essence, an authenticity, a core element of their being, 
‘the essential thing […] the thread that connects them to their most remote 
ancestral past’, as Cheikh Anta Diop put it. Khoisan revivalism is not only 
about mourning what has been lost; the revival of the past is deemed equally 
imperative. Rediscovering ‘this feeling of historical continuity’ is elemental for 
those who have experienced colonization and ‘cultural aggression of all sorts’, 
according to Diop. Khoisan revivalists certainly strive ‘to know and to live 
their true history’ with rigour, both as an ‘efficient cultural weapon’ and as the 
‘most solid shield of cultural security’. Feeling divorced from the past, Khoisan 
revivalists attempt to bridge that felt sense of distance. Mourning and reviving 
are two sides of the same coin, indications that the past strikes an emotional 
chord with Khoisan revivalists, possibly with life-​changing consequences. Not 
surprisingly therefore, as I have shown, terms such as ‘healing’ and ‘trauma’ 
permeate Khoisan revivalism. The regularity with which I encountered these 
terms made me ponder the ascribed ‘therapeutic’ qualities of my interlocutors’ 
engagements with the past. If historical legacies can be considered ‘traumatic’, 
then Khoisan revivalism might perform a process akin to ‘therapy’ from my 
interlocutors’ point of view. I wondered how ‘therapeutic’ engagements with 
the past might look like in terms of methodology, sources, style, and ideas con­
cerning authentic representations of, or engagements with, the past. As I was 
eager to theorize alongside my interlocutors and perused inspirational works 
that suggested this could be a productive line of enquiry, I decided early on to 
base my theoretical assessment of Khoisan revivalism around this observation.
Before I elaborate on the specifics of my approach, some caveats are neces­
sary. While the concepts ‘trauma’, ‘healing’, or ‘therapy’ stem from the fields of

psychiatry and medicine, I have no intention of diagnosing whether Khoisan 
revivalists are traumatized, actually perform self-​therapy, or experience psy­
chological healing in the biomedical sense. That said, the belief that South 
African society is ‘traumatized’ due to its ‘vast archive of suffering’ is hardly 
controversial (Colvin 2008, 223). If ‘trauma’ refers to both the event and its 
psychological traces, then Khoisan revivalists are at least partially affected by 
these historical legacies (Fassin and Rechterman 2009, 4). Various scholars 
have made the case for such intergenerational trauma, with regards to indig­
enous people and others, citing a loss of identity and culture, as well as vari­
ous psychological and physical ailments as evidence (see e.g. Alfred 2009, 42, 
49; Argenti and Schramm 2009; Montgomery 2019). Frantz Fanon, who I come 
back to later on, is well-​known for his analysis of the colonial/​postcolonial con­
dition as a psychopathology (Gibson and Beneduce 2017, 17). Charles Taylor 
(1994, 25–​26) also famously argued that ‘[n]‌onrecognition or misrecognition’, 
as a consequence of assimilationist policies for instance, has the potential of 
‘imprisoning someone in a false, distorted, and reduced mode of being […] [It] 
can inflict a grievous wound, saddling its victims with a crippling self-​hatred’. 
As various groups began coalescing and demanding justice and recognition 
on the basis of their trauma, a specific mode of identity politics demanding a 
victim-​oriented reinterpretation of the past materialized (Misztal 2004; Fassin 
and Rechterman 2009, 16; Fukuyama 2018). Critics believe that terms such as 
trauma have become inflated and divorced from their original meaning in the 
process (Huyssen 2000, 23; Furedi 2004, 177). Trauma has undoubtedly come to 
denote any form of ‘serious violence or suffering’ in everyday discourse (Colvin 
2008, 223). According to Frank Furedi (2004, 2, 12, 152), trauma-​related vocab­
ulary has become part of our cultural imagination and therefore increasingly 
drawn on to understand both ourselves and others. While Furedi (ibid., 180) is 
mostly critical of this ‘therapy culture’, he insists that it should be seen as a 
social phenomenon first and foremost.
While the therapeutic jargon is appropriate given South Africa’s history, 
I am primarily seeking to appreciate why this vocabulary is meaningful to 
Khoisan revivalists and what it reflects on their engagements with the past. 
This calls for a second caveat, as the relationship between trauma, history, 
healing, and restitution/​reparations has taken on specific dimensions in South 
Africa. Indeed, no other institution infused the post-​apartheid era with a ‘ther­
apeutic vocabulary’ more than the South African Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission (trc) (Humphrey 2005, 208; Colvin 2008, 226). The trc operated 
between 1995 and 2003 and, among other activities, granted amnesty to perpe­
trators in exchange for coming forward with the ‘truth’ about atrocities they 
committed or were involved in during the apartheid era. As then President

Chapter 7
Nelson Mandela argued, this trade-​off would ultimately ‘heal the nation’ and 
allow victims, perpetrators, and survivors to reconcile and move on: ‘Only by 
knowing the truth can we hope to heal the terrible wounds of the past that 
are the legacy of apartheid. Only the truth can put the past to rest’ (Nelson 
Mandela cited in Field 2006, 31–​32). These religiously inspired ideals of recon­
ciliation and nation building suffused the trc’s historical narrative in its final 
report, most overtly in its insistence on multiple ‘truths’ about the past, such 
as ‘emotional truth’, ‘personal truth’, ‘healing truth’. and ‘social truth’ (Verbuyst 
2013, 6–​10). These different, subjective, and individualized interpretations of 
the past did not stand in the way of ‘healing’ but in fact contributed to the 
overarching ‘restorative truth’ Mandela also gestured towards. The trc’s inter­
pretation of the past and its overall effectiveness have been criticized from var­
ious perspectives. Some, not least Khoisan revivalists, feel excluded because 
their dispossession and colonization far predates apartheid. Others, such as 
Berber Bevernage (2008,164; 2010, 164), have shown how the trc’s insistence 
on closure does not work for the various victims for whom the past, including 
that of apartheid, is still very much in the ‘present’. The extent to which the trc 
or similar bodies managed to ‘heal’, or for that matter reconcile, compensate, 
or deliver transitional justice indeed remains hotly contested (cf. Humphrey 
2005, 204–​206; Bevernage 2014).
What struck me while studying the trc during earlier research was the 
virtual absence of historians in the commission. Most had a background in 
law or theology. While the reasons remain unclear, there are indications that 
leading figures in the trc saw historians as hell-​bent on fact-​finding and 
stubbornly clinging to a singular definition of truth, which ran counter to the 
framework of multiple truths (Verbuyst 2013, 10). Notwithstanding this nar­
row understanding of historians, as others have pointed out, it is not a coin­
cidence that a series of heritage projects ‘celebrating, commemorating, and 
often commodifying selected aspects of the past’ were set up as the trc was 
propagating its vision on how (not) to deal with the past (Hamilton, Mbenga 
and Ross 2010, 1). The trc explicitly supported heritage studies and commem­
orative sites that embodied the anc-​driven reconciliation narrative (Verbuyst 
2013, 22). Historical research as such was not part of the report’s recommen­
dations. Post-​apartheid heritage legislation also emphasized the importance 
of nation-​building and propped up heritage as ‘a form of therapy’ or ‘a thera­
peutic device’, an inexpensive measure compared to material compensation 
and socioeconomic development (Marschall 2005, 78; Meskell 2011, 17–​18, 
72, 256). As I noted in the Introduction, this formula did not work for every­
one. Heritage remains a hotly contested terrain in South Africa, not least for 
Khoisan revivalists. As Lynn Meskell and Colette Scheermeyer (2008, 156) have

observed, the anc-​sanctioned narrative prioritizes anc members and the 
recent past: ‘the longer, more complex colonial history of the country, and the 
reasons why apartheid was successfully entrenched in the first instance, have 
been subsequently downplayed’. Whether heritage effectuates healing in post-​
conflict societies like South Africa is not my concern here (Giblin 2014, 500, 
509). Nor do I want to get bogged down in debates about the ‘therapeutic state’, 
that is, whether the state should strive to effectuate healing and promote a 
therapeutic discourse, although I broach the subject in the Conclusion (see 
e.g. Humphrey 2005, 209; Marrus 2007, 88). As with trauma-​related language, 
I am primarily interested in the notion that heritage has therapeutic qualities 
and not so much in whether it actually possesses these (see also Giblin 2014, 
500–​502).
As I explained in the Introduction, I see heritage as a process. I hinted at cer­
tain distinctions and tensions with what is traditionally termed ‘history’, all the 
while acknowledging both heritage and history as engagements with the past 
in the first instance, as well as the fact that no clear line can be drawn between 
the two. Keeping the specific South African triangular relationship between 
trauma, history/​heritage, and healing in mind, I explore these distinctions 
and tensions at greater length in this chapter and enter Khoisan revivalism 
into a dialogue with various international case studies. On that note, I want to 
underscore that, as previous chapters have attested to, many Khoisan revivalist 
engagements with the past have to do with seeking compensation for histori­
cal injustices. This includes claiming land and other forms of reparations in the 
material sense. For some, this might fit uneasily under the rubric of ‘healing’. 
I am not arguing that these types of engagements necessarily conform to the 
characteristics of the ‘therapeutics of emic history’ I spell out below. My goal 
is not to ascertain which ‘type’ of engagements with the past align with which 
‘type’ of Khoisan revivalists. Nor is it to make a value-​judgement about whether 
emic histories are superior or inferior to other ways of engaging with the past. 
I have continuously stressed the diversity of Khoisan revivalists’ engagements 
with the past and I do not argue otherwise in this chapter. Nevertheless, I do 
aim to show that there are commonalities that help us better understand the 
phenomenon as a whole. In my reading, individual cases that do not fit the 
pattern should therefore be considered exceptions that prove the rule.
With this important caveat in mind, one concept from the literature stood 
out for its ability to grasp much about Khoisan revivalists’ emic histories: ‘ther­
apeutic history’, as coined by the anthropologist Ronald Niezen in one of his 
lesser-​known works, The Rediscovered Self (2009). While some have highlighted 
its potential as an analytical concept (Hodgson 2010b, 698), it has not been 
picked up by academics. Given its relevance for Khoisan revivalism, I work

with it throughout this chapter while drawing on complementary insights from 
the fields of history, heritage studies, postcolonial studies, and settler-​colonial 
studies. In the first subchapter, I explain therapeutic history in greater detail 
and link it to characteristics which David Lowenthal discerned about ‘heritage’. 
I also revisit some of my empirical data in light of their insights. I continue 
doing so in the second subchapter by honing in and expanding on the concept 
of ‘authenticity’. Across two sections I deal with authenticity ‘from above’ (i.e. 
‘repressive authenticity’ as embodied in the Khoisan extinctions discourse) 
and ‘from below’ (i.e. Khoisan revivalists’ ‘subversive authenticity’), although 
I will complicate this distinction along the way. I close with a brief reflection 
on the conundrums that arise from the political implications of ‘subversive 
authenticity’, as well as the analytical distinctions between therapeutic history 
and academic history.
7.1	
Therapeutic History, Heritage, and the Case of Khoisan Revivalism
In The Rediscovered Self (2009), Ronald Niezen reflects on his work among 
indigenous communities in northern Canada, among other things, to scruti­
nize the role of the past in a context of indigenous revival, although he speaks 
of ‘rediscovery’, ‘reconstruction’, and ‘recovery’ instead. He is primarily inter­
ested in how the past informs identity construction. In the preface, Niezen 
summarizes what he means with a ‘rediscovered self’ in this context:
[R]‌ecovering an essence seen to have once been a part of one’s innermost 
being but that was temporarily lost, maligned, and excoriated by outside 
forces, in some cases slated for elimination though state-​sponsored poli­
cies of assimilation. The rediscovered self is the articulation of collective 
being that has been brought back from an imposed condition of oblivion 
and forgetting.
niezen 2009, xv–​xvi
Key to this collective ‘rediscovering of the self’ is a process of ‘therapeutic 
history’:
[T]‌he appropriation or sponsorship of narratives about the past as 
a way to define the moral essence of a people [and] to recover from a 
lingering collective experience of rejection, dispossession, assimilation, 
and economic and political marginalization […] Its main criterion for 
determining the truth is the subjective experience of group affirmation,

the way it makes people feel about themselves […] The qualities and 
feats of one’s forbears can be artistically and educationally cultivated 
in a process of common remembering that can improve one’s potential 
to act and to develop a sense of personal ability and worth […] It thus 
emphasizes those aspects of the past that are emotionally positive, such 
as social peace, egalitarianism, spiritual enlightenment, and harmony 
with nature, while excoriating anything that is inconsistent with today’s 
widely accepted standards of environmental and political responsibility.
niezen 2009, 149–​150
According to Niezen (2009, 153), a ‘critique of the West’s cultural imperialism’ 
and a ‘recovery of indigenous virtues’ are therefore central features of thera­
peutic history. The emphasis is commonly placed on histories of disposses­
sion and violence, on the one hand, and periods in (pre-​colonial) history when 
‘one’s people were stronger, healthier, more autonomous, and, above all, more 
respected’, on the other. The latter offer ‘a model with possibilities for emula­
tion, from which to draw inspiration not simply as a representation of a good 
society but also as a source of self-​discovery, of access to one’s innermost being’. 
Therapeutic history serves as a rallying point to thicken a sense of community; 
it generates a framework to articulate a felt sense of oppression, which can also 
form the basis for a campaign of redress (ibid., 177). While Niezen (ibid., 153, 
167–​168) recognizes that therapeutic history bolsters indigenous nationalisms 
and entitlement claims, he emphasizes that it is but one aspect of ‘a personal 
and collective movement towards wellness’, though not necessarily in the bio­
medical sense.
Niezen is particularly interested in the tensions between therapeutic history 
and history of the academic kind. I address some of his concerns at the end of 
this chapter as they relate to therapeutic history’s political ramifications. Suffice 
it to say that one of his central observations is that what counts as ‘true knowl­
edge’ in therapeutic history does not stem primarily (or necessarily) from ‘a 
consensus on fundamental facts and on refinement or revision of that consen­
sus through systematic, thorough, and critical presentation of evidence’, as is 
the case in academic history-​writing, at least in theory (Niezen 2009, 167–​168). 
Rather, the ultimate criterion is its ‘contribution to the intellectual comforts of 
self-​validation’, as therapeutic history is ‘above all auto-​history, with or without 
the assistance or cooperation of outside sympathizers’ (ibid., 154). Histories 
that cause ‘discomfort, inconvenience, the introduction of doubt, and the dis­
confirmation of self-​image’ run counter to the needs of therapeutic history and 
are shunned. As Niezen (ibid., 185–​186) notes, this rejection reflects the postco­
lonial critique that colonialism ceases only when it no longer has a hold over

Chapter 7
the politics of knowledge production. In fact, he argues that ‘an informal [in-​
group] process of validation or rejection’ in which ‘[a]‌uthenticity follows from 
public approval, from a sufficiently broad acceptance and acknowledgment 
of a fit between idea and ideal’ is typical of therapeutic engagements with the 
past (ibid.). By prioritizing the needs of indigenous people, therapeutic his­
tory is elemental to a process of indigenous revivalism: ‘Though presented as 
truth about the past and the essence of one’s being, the self-​representations of 
therapeutic history are actually part of a creative process of becoming’ (ibid., 
167–​168).
There is a great deal to unpack here as many of Niezen’s observations res­
onate strongly with Khoisan revivalism. I will address these throughout this 
chapter, but some of the main parallels can already be identified. While the 
theory certainly does not cover all of Khoisan revivalism and the analytical 
distinctions Niezen draws are too sharp (see below), Khoisan revivalists evi­
dently seek out a ‘rediscovered self’ and practice a kind of therapeutic history 
as both a reaction and a remedy to processes of dispossession and assim­
ilation. Although I find Niezen’s claim that ‘therapeutic history’ is all about 
self-​validation exaggerated, and even slightly (though unintentionally) con­
descending, there is certainly a pattern in Khoisan revivalists’ engagements 
with the past where they place an emphasis on self-​worth, a true identity, and 
one’s ‘innermost being’. Khoisan revivalism is in many ways about gaining con­
trol over how the Khoisan are represented and, by extension, how knowledge 
about them is produced. Niezen notes that therapeutic history informs enti­
tlement claims but that this is just one aspect of the overall pursuit of ‘well­
ness’ –​ a term that should not be misunderstood as just a psychological state, 
but which, for Niezen, encompasses material forms of well-​being as well. As 
the three previous chapters in particular have made clear, I believe this applies 
to Khoisan revivalism as well. What Khoisan revivalists consider useful history 
in this regard certainly differs in great respects from the academic history they 
frequently criticize, although, as I show below, this relationship is complex. 
On the face of it, Khoisan revivalism indeed coalesces around something akin 
to therapeutic history, which appeals to an increasing number of individuals 
who further contribute to the in-​group process of validation of knowledge that 
Niezen described.
It is worth pointing out how some of the attributes of therapeutic history 
conform to characteristics of non-​academic engagements with the past more 
generally. Notice for instance how, in David Lowenthal’s analytical distinction 
between ‘history’ and ‘heritage’, therapeutic history emerges as a specific prod­
uct of the latter:

The historian […] seeks to convey a past consensually known, open to 
inspection and proof, continually revised and eroded as time and hind­
sight outdate its truths. The heritage fashioner, however historically scru­
pulous, seeks to design a past that will fix the identity and enhance the 
well-​being of some chosen individual or folk. History cannot be wholly 
dispassionate, or it will not be felt worth learning or conveying; heritage 
cannot totally disregard history, or it will seem too incredible to com­
mand fealty. But the aims that animate these two enterprises, and their 
modes of persuasion, are contrary to each other.
lowenthal 1998, xi; my emphasis
Lowenthal distinguishes between history and heritage on the basis of separate 
intentions while acknowledging that this distinction is often blurred in practice 
(Lowenthal 1998, x). The notion that history ought to serve life by contributing 
to ‘well-​being’ never disappeared entirely, but there was a concerted effort to 
disabuse it of this function from the late 18th century onward, when history 
was reframed as a dispassionate and critical enquiry more than anything else 
(Lowenthal 2015, 4).1 Historians have become reflexive about such concepts 
since the postmodern turn, but there is a continued belief that the author­
ity of historians stems from their ‘impartial’, ‘critical’, and ‘objective’ pursuit of 
truth over interpretation (Southgate 2003, 29; 2005, 21). The differences that 
Lowenthal discerns between heritage and history should therefore be seen as 
tools to think with, rather than as strawmen, or as implying value judgements 
(see Introduction). All the while, I revisit these distinctions towards the end of 
this chapter as they have political ramifications as well, not least because ther­
apeutic history is arguably a hybrid between ‘heritage’ and ‘history’. It is with 
these caveats in mind that I draw on Lowenthal and Niezen’s insights through­
out this chapter.
Let me first off identify insights from heritage studies that are most germane 
to the concept of therapeutic history. I have already noted how, just like Niezen 
places ‘wellness’ at the core of therapeutic history, Lowenthal sees ‘well-​being’ 
as the desired outcome of heritage. Heritage makes the past less ‘foreign’ and 
more accommodating of present needs, whereas history is the dispassionate 
	1	 Beverley Southgate (2005, 8) has argued that the pursuit of academic history can equally 
fulfil ‘therapeutic’ functions: ‘For history, as the study of the past, can take one’s mind off 
the troubles of the present; it can serve to put one’s own problems into longer chronological 
perspective; and it can provide models for how to lead a better life’. This, however, is not 
something I explore here as I focus entirely on non-​academic engagements with the past by 
Khoisan revivalists.

study of the past on its own terms. As I noted in the Introduction, Lowenthal 
considers both equally important, if fulfilling different roles in life. History 
emphasizes difference and distance from the present to enhance its claim to 
objectivity (Lowenthal 1998, 109, 119). Heritage instead aspires to subjectiv­
ity: ‘Celebrating some bits and forgetting others, heritage shapes an embrace­
able past’, a congenial and affective one, commonly focused on specific parts 
that are most fit for purpose (Lowenthal 1998, 148, 162; see also Slotkin 2005, 
225–​226; Landsberg 2015, 178–​179). ‘While historians aim to reduce bias, heri­
tage sanctions and strengthens it. Bias is a vice that history struggles to excise; 
for heritage, bias is a nurturing virtue’, Lowenthal argues (Lowenthal 1998, 
122). Once more as in therapeutic history, heritage is valued for its ability to 
address current needs, not for being able to withstand critical scrutiny (ibid., 
127). It is a personally or collectively tailored version of the past, excised of 
the ‘obnoxious and the awkward’ or the ambiguous: ‘Retooling the past to our 
needs and desires, we merge into it, conform it with ourselves, and ourselves 
with it, matching our self-​images and aspirations. Rendered grand or homely, 
magnified or tarnished, the past is continually recast to promote personal or 
group agendas’ (Lowenthal 2015, 40, 502; see also Landsberg 2015, 9). Fact and 
fiction alike feature in heritage; their distinction in fact becomes blurred, if 
not deliberately obfuscated (Lowenthal 1998, 128; see also De Groot 2015, 2). 
Accuracy is not the main concern in heritage: ‘We ask of heritage an imagined 
past, not an actual one’ (Lowenthal 1998, 165).
Certain Khoisan revivalists would be (rightly) offended by Lowenthal’s 
claims that they deliberately blur fact and fiction, conceptualize an ‘imagined 
past’, and explicitly promote bias, as it could imply that their engagements 
with the past are somehow dishonest or constitute a ‘lesser’ form of history. 
But this is not what these authors argue or why their insights are valuable to 
think with. However, in order to explain my position I need to contextualize 
terms at the core of their assessments, such as ‘accuracy’ and ‘authenticity’. 
Before I fine-​tune this terminology and refine my argument in the next sub­
chapter, let me revisit some of my empirical material and make additional pre­
liminary observations about the sources and methods that Khoisan revivalists 
draw on in order to highlight the value of viewing their engagements with the 
past through the lenses of therapeutic history and heritage.
It is appropriate to start off with the role of (academic) historical narratives. 
Historical fiction, particularly in an audio-​visual format, has become a source 
of knowledge about the past in its own right against the backdrop of the rise of 
heritage and non-​academic engagements with the past (see e.g. Rassool 2000, 
21; Lowenthal 2015, 14). History of this kind is often considered more accessible 
and suitable for the cultivation of a profound historical experience than a work

of academic history in the classical format. In the context of Khoisan reviv­
alism, one can point to the circulation of Khoisan-​related imagery on social 
media or to the engagements with movies such as Krotoa or The Gods Must 
Be Crazy. As Kalle Pihlainen (2014, 17) observed, these are so popular because 
consumers ‘are not burdened by the same commitment to truthfulness as the 
historian’. He adds that ‘historical arguments still have a high status in many 
contexts […] [A]‌lthough the interpretation of the past is understood as being 
rhetorical on one level, this rhetoric continues to play a central role in the ways 
in which we position ourselves in the present’ (ibid., 15). Indeed, the objec­
tive claim to knowledge attached to academic historiography appeals to those 
who seek to give their claims a specific layer of authority. This reasoning belies 
the way most Khoisan revivalists relate to academic historiography: due to the 
country’s long colonial history, its exponents are critiqued for omitting or dis­
torting what they regard as their ‘true’ history. However, academic histories are 
not rejected outright but (critically) mobilized as sources to formulate counter 
narratives, which can come in various shapes. This simultaneous rejection and 
appropriation of academic history-​writing is typical of postcolonial settings 
and shows how academia remains a significant battleground (Ashcroft 2002, 
103; Clifford 2004, 5; Falzetti 2015, 129).
Among other things, Khoisan revivalists have authored their own (aca­
demic) history texts, curated their own guided tours, edited their own newspa­
pers, and created their own museums to propagate their interpretations of the 
past. At the same time, they have also spread their views on the past through 
hip hop and other musical genres, theatre performances, and incorporated 
them into everyday acts such as drinking rooibos tea or speaking Afrikaans. In 
light of the urgency attached to therapeutic history, and indeed to the need to 
address the debilitating legacies of colonialism, emic histories come in both 
conventional and less conventional forms. Khoisan revivalists work through 
as many channels and with as many mediums as possible to get their mes­
sage across. However, what makes their engagements with the past stand out –​ 
and indeed, as I argue in more detail below, potentially ‘subversive’ –​ is not 
so much their style, but their content. Niezen’s observation that therapeutic 
history focuses on histories of dispossession, on the one hand, and the preco­
lonial (anti-​colonial) past, on the other, certainly rings true. As I have shown, 
Khoisan revivalists highlight how their forbears lost their lives and land and 
were forcefully assimilated into colonial society. The recurrent celebration 
of episodes such as the 1510 defeat of D’Almeida or other Khoisan resistance 
campaigns are, on the other hand, examples of the characteristic emphasis on 
anti-​colonial or precolonial history. There are obvious reasons why these pasts 
are continuously fronted, but they are selected first and foremost for their

purported relevance for the present. Details or ‘accuracy’ are less relevant than 
ascribing meaning or bolstering entitlement claims and generalizations about 
the past (e.g. ‘The Khoisan were the first resistance fighters’ or ‘The Khoisan 
were here first’).
There is, however, another crucial component to Khoisan revivalists’ 
engagements with the past: their (historical) experiences of being known as 
Coloured, which adds a layer of complexity to the binary indigenous/​non-​
indigenous that is typically constitutive of a process of indigenous revival­
ism. As I explained in Chapter 4, these experiences relate to past and present 
perceptions of Coloured identity as an empty shell devoid of indigeneity and 
marked not only by connotations of miscegenation and assimilation but also 
by a felt sense of socioeconomic and political marginalization in the post-​
apartheid era by virtue of having this racial classification. Such experiences 
need to be factored into their engagements with the past in order to deliver on 
the ‘wellness’ that is at the heart of therapeutic history. On that note, ‘wellness’ 
is a rather vague term and needs to be translated to the specific context of 
Khoisan revivalism (see above). The same holds true with the embrace of ‘bias’, 
which should not be misunderstood as implying something necessarily ‘neg­
ative’, but rather as subjectivity. The question then becomes ‘which bias and 
why’? As I explained in Chapter 4, Khoisan revivalists make the past relatable 
in their pursuit of historical continuity. Historical figures, events, and practices 
are primarily engaged with this goal in mind. Anachronism is shunned, at least 
in theory, in academic history-​writing, but emerges here as an efficient tool 
as it collapses temporal distance and allows for the meaning of the past to be 
extracted (see also Lowenthal 2015, 538). Examples that come to mind here 
are the depictions of Autshumato in Ruben Richard’s Bastaards or Humans 
as the ‘Cape Town-​based strategic communications expert and international 
liaison officer’ or interpretations of Krotoa as a feminist icon. Similarly, the 
past is frequently romanticized. The precolonial Cape is for instance com­
monly described as a place of gender equality, egalitarianism, and abundance. 
Such interpretations of the past provide models for emulation and inspiration. 
The complicity of some Khoisan in colonialism works counter to such needs 
and is therefore not necessarily denied but evidently less focused on. I want 
to underscore that I am not arguing that such depictions are falsehoods but 
rather am stressing how they are primarily intent on delivering on the aims of 
therapeutic history, a way of engagement with the past that exists only due to 
the devastation brought about by colonialism. Most Khoisan revivalists want 
anything but a dispassionate reading of the past: they want a relatable and 
relevant one first and foremost, one that serves the ends of Khoisan revivalism.

Khoisan Revivalism and the Therapeutics of Emic History
291
Coming back to my earlier point: if relatability is the prime concern, then 
it follows that lived and historical experiences of being known as Coloured 
are viewed as an extension of the trials and tribulations of the Khoisan who 
faced the colonialists in the 17th century. In Chapter 4, I noted how a Khoisan 
‘lens’ brings into focus those aspects of both the past and the present that are 
considered relatable and relevant in this regard. Khoisan revivalism is marked 
by a core set of grievances related to identity, land, traditional leadership, and 
so forth, but, as the development of Khoisan revivalism across time shows, 
the Khoisan lens is able to adapt to new elements as they emerge, such as the 
mobilization around ‘Krotoa International Airport’. This explains the current 
variety in articulations of indigeneity among Cape Town-​based Khoisan reviv­
alists. The Khoisan lens indeed has to be flexible enough to accommodate the 
great diversity of (potential) Khoisan revivalists, yet it cannot, and does not, 
refract radically different interpretations of the past because those who find 
Khoisan revivalism appealing seem to share the same sociocultural experi­
ences. The Khoisan lens is premised on this specific ‘bias’, which is simulta­
neously claimed in the process. As Lowenthal notes, history (in theory) strives 
to be open to everyone, but heritage is frequently thought of as a posses­
sion, only accessible or open for critical scrutiny by the in-​group (Lowenthal 
1998,146; 2015, 505, 596). However inclusive Khoisan revivalism might be in 
many respects, one of its central tenets is the experience of being known as 
Coloured, to which only a limited number of people can reasonably lay claim 
to. This is why Khoisan revivalism’s ‘therapeutic history’ indeed cultivates that 
sense of community and rallying point for redress Niezen identified. For what­
ever else, the Khoisan revivalist community in Cape Town is certainly real in 
its effects; friendships are made, a network is established, and frictions arise. It 
is also in this particular network that knowledge validation takes place, which 
I say more about towards the end of this chapter when I reflect on the political 
implications of basing engagements with the past on ‘experience’.
Before moving on, I want to highlight two more mediums through which 
Khoisan revivalists both source and spread their interpretations of the past, 
as they also showcase the centrality of the ‘Coloured experience’. Eerste Nasie 
Nuus (enn), which I cite throughout this book, certainly comes to mind here. 
enn is first and foremost a communication tool. As I explained in Chapter 1, 
while it is run by Zenzile Khoisan and Debbie Hendricks, whose particular 
political viewpoints and opinions are apparent in the newspaper’s orientation, 
the publication strives to be as inclusive as possible and regularly publishes 
opinions that go against the editors’ points of view. All the while, however, enn 
emerges as a source of authority or ‘in-​group validation’. As it is part of the 
nature of Khoisan revivalism itself, enn is not responsible for inventing the

Chapter 7
arguments about historical continuity that define it or for policing what its 
contents are, but, with Zenzile Khoisan at the helm, it certainly acts as a mega­
phone in this regard. As I noted repeatedly, there is a great deal of diversity in 
Khoisan revivalism, but enn inescapably occupies a niche through its implicit 
rather than explicit endorsement of what its core features are. No compara­
ble publication exists, making enn a highly valuable source for both potential 
and seasoned Khoisan revivalists. Having said that, a different kind of research 
would have to track the distribution and consumption of enn among Khoisan 
revivalists to properly gauge its impact.
A similar study would need to measure the influence of social media. I did 
not conduct this research, but I have noted previously that social media –​ 
Facebook and WhatsApp in particular –​ has become a key medium for Khoisan 
revivalists. To a certain degree, this simply reflects the rise of social media 
worldwide. However, several authors have argued that it fulfils specific roles in 
the context of (indigenous) activism, and many of their findings resonate with 
my observations about Khoisan revivalism. Many have pointed to the demo­
cratic nature of the medium in allowing users to cultivate safe spaces to cele­
brate, counter, publicize, discuss, and exchange their or others’ interpretations 
of the past without having to fear censure, ridicule, or discrimination from out­
siders (Kolia 2016, 613; Bodunrin 2018, 176; Brinkman and Luyckfasseel 2020, 
16). Social media can operate as a way for indigenous people to take control 
of the way they are depicted and the way they feature in discourses (Carlson 
2016, 251). Platforms like Facebook also allow for likeminded users to identify, 
organize, and network among one another with ease (Lumby 2010, 69). I read­
ily made use of this digitally sustained network to both examine the diversity 
of articulations of indigeneity in Khoisan revivalism, as well as to get in touch 
with potential research participants. Some of these connections extend across 
continents, giving rise to ‘imagined communities’ of indigenous people of an 
unprecedented scale (Niezen 2009, 58). As Maximillian Forte (2016b, 267) put 
it, social media has given indigenous people and other marginalized groups ‘a 
web of mutual recognition and self-​definition’, the potential of which for indig­
enous people might rival that of the printing press for European nationalists.
As I noted, I did not conduct the necessary research to respond to these 
observations in detail. What I have certainly observed, however, is that social 
media has indeed amplified the circulation of the imagery and information 
which Khoisan revivalists draw on to shape their identities (see also Dodge 
2006, 355; Clifford 2013, 279; Lowenthal 2015, 37). Social media is designed to 
stimulate the rapid dissemination of easily digestible information, often in 
a visual or concise format, but, as I noted, it is also used to share academic 
books and articles. This digital archive drastically increases the access to such

information and speeds up its dissemination. However, critics fear that the 
nature of the exchange of information on social media simultaneously under­
mines the belief in objective facts and polarizes its users (Cox 2017). Its algo­
rithms are not geared towards exploring differences of opinion but instead 
encourage the formation of ‘echo chambers’, virtual environments that rein­
force pre-​existing opinions or push them to extremes. Niezen (2005, 537) has 
also reflected on this, noting that the freedom associated with the medium 
proves as empowering as disempowering because it destabilizes the idea of 
evidence and facts. This means that ‘almost any idea –​ no matter how impre­
cise and unsubstantiated’ –​ can attain the status of ‘evidence’ and live a digital 
life of its own (Niezen 2009, 157). I too have seen how social media allows for 
the dissemination of information and opinions, both for better and worse. It 
stimulates debate, but these discussions can easily descend into conspiracy 
thinking or conflicts. More research is required to assess the role of social 
media in Khoisan revivalism, but it is clear that some would celebrate it as a 
safe space, whereas others would dismiss it as an echo-​chamber.
This observation to a large extent applies to assessments of Khoisan reviv­
alism as a whole. Recall here the differences of opinion I detailed in the 
Introduction. Some might view Khoisan revivalists as marginalized individuals 
who are attempting to reclaim history and authenticity in the wake of colonial­
ism, the cultivation of a ‘safe space’ to reap the benefits of therapeutic history. 
Critics might, on the other hand, discern in Khoisan revivalism great cause for 
concern, seeing it instead as a misguided quest for essentialism and entitle­
ment fuelled by an ‘echo-​chamber’ of inauthentic colonialist representations. 
I side with the former assessment (although with an emphatic asterisk –​ see 
below), but critics certainly have a point in so far as they highlight the com­
plex role of authenticity in Khoisan revivalism. As I revisit more empirical data 
and add to the theoretical analysis in the next subchapter, I make clear why 
‘authenticity’ indeed needs to be scrutinized in some detail in order to appre­
ciate its relationship to therapeutic history, heritage, and what I refer to as the 
Khoisan revivalist guide to reclaiming history and authenticity more generally.
7.2	
Subverting ‘Repressive Authenticity’? The Khoisan Revivalist Guide 
to Reclaiming History and Authenticity
I have used the word ‘authenticity’ countless times in this book, yet I have 
stopped short of defining it. Due to its centrality in this subchapter, it is neces­
sary that I do so here. I have perhaps made do without a definition because of the 
inherently ambiguous meanings that are commonly assigned to ‘authenticity’

Chapter 7
in both popular and academic discourse. Definitions of authenticity refer to 
the ‘quality of being authentic’ or, among other things, being true, real, origi­
nal, honest, genuine, sincere, natural, pure, rightful, or accurate (see e.g. Taylor 
1992, 29; Chakrabarty 2007, 79–​80; Jones 2010, 181; Lindholm 2013, 362).2 While 
I work with the tensions that arise from these various ascriptions below, I want 
to make a crucial analytical distinction between ‘accuracy’ and ‘authenticity’ 
by drawing on a study of historical fiction by Laura Saxton (2020). Saxton starts 
off with the observation that ‘accuracy’, that is, ‘adherence to established –​ or 
agreed upon –​ historical fact’, is often considered ‘a marker of merit’, not just 
when writing about the past in an academic setting but also when evaluating 
historical fiction (ibid., 127–​128). ‘Authenticity’ is frequently used interchange­
ably with accuracy, but this, she argues, is incorrect as the latter is not a pre­
condition for the former. In the distinction Saxton proposes, authenticity is 
defined as a ‘far more complex, variable, and subjective concept’: ‘Authenticity 
refers to the experience of consuming an historical text and the audience’s 
impression of whether it captures the past, even if this is at odds with available 
evidence’ (ibid., 128). In this sense, an inaccurate representation of the past 
can still be considered authentic and an accurate depiction might neverthe­
less be seen as inauthentic. Authenticity and accuracy are certainly related, as 
the ‘verisimilitude’ (i.e. the quality of emulating what is considered original or 
accurate with a certain degree of proximity) evidently bolsters authenticity. 
Whereas accuracy can be debated in reference to established facts, methods, 
and primary sources (i.e. ‘the methodologies of academic historians’, which 
admittedly also depend on the standards of the time), the debate over authen­
ticity is ultimately ‘shaped intertextually, culturally, and subjectively’, Saxton 
concludes. Authenticity relates to the essence of the past and therefore ulti­
mately lies in the eye of the beholder.
While based on a study of historical fiction, Saxton’s observations about 
(historical) authenticity as a subjective quality, though certainly not origi­
nal (see also Cohen 1988; Banks 2013; Ellis 2014), are relevant for the type of 
anthropological investigation I engage in here. Elaborating on her juxtaposi­
tion of authenticity and accuracy, as well as on the role of verisimilitude in this 
equation, is particularly helpful for my analysis. In this subchapter, I revisit 
more empirical data and expand on earlier arguments concerning therapeutic 
history to show how authenticity is shaped by Khoisan revivalists and various 
other parties, resulting in a set of tensions that determine the specific roles and 
	2	 I am interested in ‘authenticity’ as an anthropological notion, not as a philosophical one. 
Hence, I do not reference the vast literature on the subject in the field of philosophy.

shapes of authenticity in Khoisan revivalism. In the section below, I begin by 
looking at such influences as they manifest themselves primarily ‘from above’. 
I then shift the focus to my main concern: understanding how Khoisan revival­
ists shape authenticity ‘from below’.
7.2.1	
Authenticity after Colonialism: Repressive Authenticity and the 
Khoisan Extinction Discourse
If ‘authenticity’ is subjective, it changes over time. Khoisan revivalists seek to 
effectuate such a shift, not least because they are dismayed with the degree 
to which Khoisan authenticity continues to be shaped by people other than 
themselves. While their self-​representations were never determined entirely 
by others, Khoisan revivalism constitutes an unprecedented assertion of 
agency in this respect. All the while, the sources of Khoisan revivalism remain 
informed by the Khoisan extinction discourse I described in Chapter 2, if to 
varying degrees. From the first encounters between Khoisan and Europeans, 
but particularly from the mid-​17th century onward, colonialists generated a 
swathe of stereotypes to represent the Khoisan as lazy, inhuman, heathen, 
and (nobly) savage. During the 19th and 20th century, the notion that the 
Khoisan had all but perished as a result of colonial encroachment took root 
and informed both popular and academic representations. The image of the 
Khoisan as pristine stone-​age hunter-​gatherers living in the desert is a product 
of this era. Scientists and artists alike flocked to places where the remaining 
Khoisan were thought to reside in order to ‘salvage’ their ways of life before 
they vanished in the face of modernization. Accordingly, an urban Khoisan 
presence was disavowed. As my references to the international literature attest 
to, the trope of the ‘vanishing native’ is not unique to South Africa, and ‘extinc­
tion discourses’ exert(ed) influence elsewhere as well. While these representa­
tions were criticized in academic and public circles in South Africa from the 
1960s and 1970s onward, indeed culminating in Khoisan revivalism itself, the 
Khoisan extinction discourse goes on to inform Khoisan representation to a 
great extent. Its spectre has been apparent at various points in this text.
For one, Khoisan revivalists continue to experience disbelief and ridicule 
when their classification as Coloured and urban upbringing and lifestyle are 
referenced to deny their Khoisan identities. While perceptions are quickly 
changing, Cape Town is still associated with a historical Khoisan presence 
more so than a contemporary one. It is where the origins of colonialism in 
South Africa lie, making the case for historical continuity difficult to sustain 
there, at least according to some. By associating indigeneity with remote­
ness and rural lifestyles, cities are often seen as either devoid of indigenous 
people, or as places where they necessarily feel alienated (James 2012, 256).

Chapter 7
Urban-​based indigenous people usually require more ‘identity work’ to qual­
ify as ‘authentic’, both in the eyes of peers and others, than those who ‘look 
the part’ in rural areas (cf. Carlson 2016, 166). Khoisan revivalists in Cape 
Town indeed do not conform to what Frans Prins (2009, 193) has referred to 
as ‘Kalahari San stereotypes’, yardsticks to measure Khoisan authenticity that 
are based on the Khoisan residing in the Kalahari region, particularly in the 
wake of salvage ethnography. Various commentators have identified such 
stereotypes: being short in stature, wearing animal skins, hunting with bow 
and arrow, herding animals, speaking click languages, being close to nature, 
and residing in a desert climate (cf. Jackson and Robins 1999, 71; Besten 2011b, 
176; Ellis 2012, 16). As a result of the widespread circulation of such ideas and 
imagery, the Khoisan might very well be ‘one of the most imaged/​imagined 
peoples in the world’ (Francis 2010, 46). William Ellis even argued that this 
has led the word ‘bushman’ to become a representational category more so 
than a reference to an actual person (Ellis 2014, 496; see also Rassool and 
Hayes 2002).
The literature on indigenous people is awash with references to what 
Patrick Wolfe (1999, 179) termed ‘repressive authenticity’: the doubting or out­
right rejection of the authenticity of indigeneity if it does not conform to a set 
of top-​down criteria or popular concepts, like the ‘Kalahari San stereotypes’. 
More often than not, these criteria, which inform policies and popular opin­
ions alike, both explicitly and more subtly, reflect non-​indigenous assumptions 
about indigenous people that might have little salience among the people con­
cerned. Expressions of identity and culture are disqualified or met with suspi­
cion if they venture beyond pre-​set boundaries, thereby allowing little room 
for hybridity or an acknowledgement of historical change. This led Jeff Sissons 
(2005, 37) to conclude that ‘indigenous authenticity is racism and primitivism 
in disguise’, an unfair set of requirements thrusted upon an already margin­
alized group. Niezen (2009, 180) too has argued that indigenous people are 
often required to act out a kind of ‘cultural primordialism’ in order for their cul­
tures and identities to be legible by the wider public. Maximillian Forte (2006a, 
63) concurs: ‘Few, or no, other people on this planet have been consistently 
held to such rigid standards of “proof,” to represent themselves with an authen­
ticity that accords with distant antiquity, like museum pieces on legs’. As Jace 
Weaver (Weaver 2005, 228) remarked, if indigenous people are cast as extinct, 
that implies that they do not ‘change’.
Wolfe coined the concept of repressive authenticity in particular to point to 
instances where it is used to deny indigenous people certain (land) rights and 
forms of legal recognition by the state. In order to qualify for such recognition, 
indigenous people habitually need to exhibit a certain degree of historical

continuity in terms of customs, practices, and identification. Too much histor­
ical continuity might be interpreted as a sign that special forms of recognition 
are not warranted, but too little renders the claim illegible (Kolia 2016, 617–​618; 
Rifkin 2017, 5). The struggle for recognition can demand of indigenous people 
to live out (or act out) fetishized representations and ideals (De la Cadena and 
Starn 2007, 9). Those who refuse to go along with state-​sanctioned recognition 
politics can be dismissed as unwilling to reconcile with other members of soci­
ety and as standing in the way of cosmopolitan values (Keenan 2014, 165). All 
of this causes various critics to dismiss the politics of recognition altogether 
(see e.g. Simpson 2007). In a paradigm of repressive authenticity, indigenous 
people are locked in a frustrating state of ‘becoming’, floating in an ambigu­
ous time and space that is never quite ‘present’ (Kisin 2013, 146). They are ‘dis­
placed into an anachronistic space by which they always appear to be in an 
anterior relationship to modernity’ (Smith 2013, 357; see also Povinelli 2002, 
8; Rifkin 2017, vii). Repressive conceptualizations of authenticity struggle with 
revived identities and cultures as they have a tendency not to resemble the pre­
approved mould and to assert their contemporaneity with rigour (Cassel and 
Maureira 2017, 5). Ultimately then, those with the least ‘legible’ features lose 
out the most in the paradigm of repressive authenticity. Ironically, these tend 
to be the worst affected by assimilation and dispossession, such as Khoisan 
revivalists.
As I have already shown in Chapter 2 and beyond, dominant Khoisan 
representations have certainly proved ‘repressive’. As Julia McGee (2008, 
117) observed, ‘South African discourses on indigenous culture that centre 
temporal distance are laden with modernist conceptions of extinction and 
acculturation and often preclude contemporary exigencies’. In her ethnogra­
phy of the rooibos industry, Sarah Ives (2017, 56–​60) shows how the supposed 
extinction of the Khoisan is referenced by White industrialists to deny claim­
ants the status of traditional knowledge holders or to disrupt their campaigns 
in pursuit thereof. Generalizations regarding the Khoisan’s nomadic lifestyle 
have also been put forward to deny the land rights of certain communities 
(see e.g. Steyn 1995, 82). Some have argued that the salience of and commercial 
potential inherent in the ‘Kalahari San stereotypes’ renders the Khoisan vic­
tims of their reputation, de facto prevented from embodying a different type of 
culture or identity than that which is marketable in tourism (see e.g. Gordon 
1992, xiv; Sylvain 2003a, 145; Robins 2003a, 133; Tomaselli 2012b, 113). In short, as 
William Ellis (2015, 130) noted: ‘Any attempt by San people to live out a vision 
of San-​ness that is radically different from the popularly recognised, simulacral 
San norm is treated with suspicion [and] regarded as inauthentic’ (see also 
Mboti 2014, 473). Keyan Tomaselli (2012a, 10) concluded on the basis of similar

observations that the Khoisan were therefore stuck in a ‘cycle of representa­
tion and misrepresentation […] as these images and stories circulate among 
readers for whom the romantic image of the dying world of authenticity has 
already been fixed in countless other representations’.
Suspiciously absent in this ‘cycle’, although increasingly acknowledged in 
Khoisan studies, is the agency of the Khoisan themselves. Unless repressive 
authenticity is considered to be all defining, one wonders what ‘authenticity’ is 
mobilized ‘from below’ in order to counter that which is considered ‘repressive’. 
The ‘same’ repressive authenticity is in fact seemingly enacted with agency 
‘from below’, at times ostensibly feeding, rather than breaking out of the ‘cycle 
of representation and misrepresentation’, Tomaselli identified. But this is not 
where the complexity ends, as considering additional potential examples of 
repressive authenticity in relation to Khoisan revivalism make clear. As a set 
of rules issued by the South African state regarding the recognition of tradi­
tional leadership, the Traditional and Khoi-​San Leadership Act (tkla) is a 
likely manifestation of repressive authenticity. While some Khoisan represen­
tatives were consulted during the drafting process, many felt left out or ignored 
(see Chapter 3). Regardless of their degree of inclusion, as Khoisan revivalists 
were not the sole authors of the rules regarding their own recognition, features 
of repressive authenticity are discernible in the tkla. Among other aspects, 
Khoisan revivalists critiqued the tkla for not granting them indigenous sta­
tus, restricting recognition to the realm of traditional leadership, and co-​opt­
ing Khoisan traditional leadership into government-​sanctioned bodies. Their 
main objection, however, was that the requirement to demonstrate a history 
of self-​identification ‘from a particular point in time up to the present’ within 
‘a specific geographical area or various geographical areas’ did not take into 
account the history of dispossession and assimilation that might make such 
unabated historical continuity virtually impossible. I noted previously how 
this vague wording might actually benefit Khoisan revivalists and does not 
reflect the strict boundary policing or the ‘freezing’ of cultures in time and 
place that some have discerned in similar legislation (see e.g. Ellis 2019). Then 
again, the fact that this recognition ultimately lies with a commission that is 
staffed by non-​Khoisan remains ‘repressive’, although this wording is mislead­
ing (see below). It should also be borne in mind that the tkla deals specifically 
with the issue of traditional leadership, an institution many Khoisan revivalists 
reject in favour of other forms of recognition.
As I have shown, many do have the ambition of becoming recognized as 
Khoisan traditional leaders under the tkla and are willing to engage in the 
required competitive politics of authenticity if need be. Are they falling prey 
to repressive authenticity or are they accepting the tkla as a compromise and

exercising their agency in the process? Concomitantly, if the infighting over 
the legitimacy of leadership claims –​ which can only be partially ascribed to 
the repressive authenticity of the South African government –​ is anything to go 
by, some of the Khoisan revivalists that end up being recognized might enact 
a form of repressive authenticity of their own (see also Carlson 2016, 270). 
Indeed, many Khoisan revivalists do not wish to become subsumed under 
a traditional authority for this reason. Ultimately, of course, the rejection of 
repressive authenticity in this regard lies in granting full agency to the Khoisan 
to make the choices they see fit. What is crucial to note here, however, is that, 
in their criticism of the tkla, Khoisan revivalists also point to the agency of 
those involved in seeking its benefits. Theirs is therefore not only a rejection of 
repressive authenticity but an equally pointed critique of the strategic essen­
tialism some are engaged in in this context. To be sure, the fact that ‘essential­
isms’ have gained currency or have become a requirement for recognition from 
the state in the first place is not a choice that indigenous people have made 
for themselves but a result of complex historical processes. Seen from such a 
perspective, the strategic use of essentialisms in pursuit of resources and rec­
ognition can be a ‘weapon of the weak’, an empowering, if controversial, tactic 
(Comaroff and Comaroff 2009, 9; see Introduction). Various authors have con­
vincingly shown how marginalized groups are left with few other options but 
to resort to strategic essentialism to get public attention, recognition, or secure 
rights (see e.g. Fischer 1999, 473; Niezen 2003, 6). And yet, I argue that the situ­
ation is once again more complex in the case of Khoisan revivalism.
Take for instance the fact that ngo s concerned with indigenous people, 
such as Survival International, have been involved for decades with Khoisan 
communities in the north of South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana (cf. Francis 
and Francis 2010; Sylvain 2005, 354; Ellis 2012, 124). These communities are 
usually those that get referenced in discussions on Khoisan marginalization 
(see e.g. Mogalakwe and Nyamnjoh 2017, 7–​8; Sylvain 2001; Sylvain 2002, 
1074). Marked by poverty, landlessness, and various forms of discrimination, 
it is not unwarranted to focus on these locales. However, it is telling that, until 
the 2018 sahrc report (see Chapter 3), Khoisan revivalists in Cape Town were 
not meaningfully included in such overviews. One could suspect repressive 
authenticity to be at work here since a possible reason for their exclusion 
might be the absence of ‘Kalahari San stereotypes’. Then again, those same 
ngo s have been criticized for their strategic essentialism, their promotion of 
idealized depictions of the Khoisan, which some argue distracts from the ‘real 
problems’ in the communities concerned, such as poverty, substance abuse, or 
intra-​community violence (Robins 2001, 853; Sylvain 2002, 1082; Wilmsen 2009, 
57–​62; Sylvain 2014, 258). To make matters more complex, as I have shown,

Chapter 7
Khoisan revivalists also deliberately tailor their identities and cultures to such 
‘Kalahari San stereotypes’ to bolster their authenticity, both for themselves and 
for others. As with urban-​based indigenous revivalists elsewhere, the rural and 
remote (i.e. what I called ‘North’ in reference to the Kalahari Desert in particu­
lar) act as reference points for aesthetic inspiration, commercial exploits, and 
overall authenticity for Khoisan revivalists in Cape Town (see e.g. Handler and 
Linnekin 1984, 282; Sissons 2005, 73; Peters and Andersen 2014, 8). Examples of 
this in previous chapters are aplenty, ranging from excursions to the Northern 
Cape, to the episode when one of my interlocutors found inspiration in a scene 
from The Gods Must Be Crazy.
Strategic essentialism or repressive authenticity have run into the limits of 
their analytical purchase here; neither provides a comprehensive understand­
ing of Khoisan revivalists’ engagements with the past. As Khoisan revivalists 
point out when making their case for the cultural genocide, it is historically 
illiterate to expect them to embody ‘Kalahari San stereotypes’. The fact that 
such stereotypes nevertheless circulate among them might be a sign of strate­
gic essentialism, a consequence of the Khoisan extinction discourse and the 
repressive authenticity it engenders. Those arguing for the cultural genocide 
thesis might agree that the Khoisan extinction discourse is all that is left as 
a model for emulation after centuries of colonial violence. ‘North’ as a point 
of reference is certainly sensible in light of this history. However, overstating 
the difference between Cape Town and ‘North’ betrays the kind of repressive 
authenticity related to urban-​based indigenous people I mentioned earlier. 
What is discernible in Cape Town are not mere embodiments of ‘Kalahari San 
stereotypes’. It would be repressive to view everything through the lens of the 
Khoisan extinction discourse or to discount the agency of Khoisan revivalists. 
While some undoubtedly exercise their agency by engaging in strategic essen­
tialism, particularly in the pursuit of entitlement claims, this lens has little 
value in framing other facets of Khoisan revivalism. The Khoisan extinction 
discourse is not simply providing the ammunition for strategic essentialism. 
Indeed, I have given countless examples of how Khoisan revivalism is all about 
adapting the past to present needs, whether through ‘Kalahari San stereotypes’ 
or something else entirely. This agency, I argued earlier, should be under­
stood as an outcome of the priorities of therapeutic history. This brings me 
to rephrase the question I posed earlier: what kind of agential ‘authenticity’ 
is pursued in a process of therapeutic history? As I argue in the next section, 
Khoisan revivalists are first and foremost developing a ‘subversive authentic­
ity’: rejecting, appropriating, and disregarding ‘repressive authenticity’ along 
the way. This reveals the complex roles of authenticity in processes of indige­
nous revivalism more generally.

Khoisan Revivalism and the Therapeutics of Emic History

7.2.2	
‘Subversive Authenticity’: Repressive Authenticity Turned inside Out?
I earlier explained how the priorities in therapeutic history are lined up to best 
accommodate the pursuit of ‘wellness’. Understood in relation to authenticity 
(i.e. a subjective interpretation of the ‘essence of the past’), one wonders what 
importance therapeutic history assigns to ‘accuracy’ and ‘verisimilitude’. The 
previous section made clear that ‘accuracy’ (i.e., as Saxton defined it, in line 
with established facts and the methodology of academic history) is a prob­
lematic concept due to the omnipresence of the Khoisan extinction discourse, 
both as a set of contemporary societal attitudes but also as a reservoir of his­
torical ideas and images that Khoisan revivalists draw on. What emerges in 
this context as ‘established facts’ is not the most productive line of enquiry. 
If ‘accuracy’ instead refers to ‘being faithful to an original’, one wonders what 
the accurate and immaculate ‘original’ is that Khoisan revivalists are supposed 
to emulate (Dean 2017, 257). One runs into similar problems with regards to 
the notion of verisimilitude (i.e. the quality of emulating what is considered 
original or accurate with a certain degree of proximity), as it is in large part 
based on the same legacies and set of ideas. I have shown how verisimilitude 
is of prime importance to Khoisan revivalists, who mobilize it in the context 
of strategic essentialism but even more so in their everyday acts of Khoisan 
revivalism. The need for verisimilitude, if defined as either explicitly rejecting 
or replicating the Khoisan extinction discourse, thus both reifies and counters 
it. I argue in this section that verisimilitude should be understood in relation 
to the priorities of therapeutic history; it needs to be likened to Khoisan reviv­
alists’ attempts to manufacture historical continuity and relatability. If viewed 
primarily through emic parameters, Khoisan revivalists paradoxically repli­
cate, appropriate, reject, and disregard the Khoisan extinction discourse in 
their pursuit of authenticity. As I argue below, the authenticity Khoisan reviv­
alists cultivate in the process has the potential to subvert and (dis)empower, 
but it also embodies a kind of meta-​critique academics should take on board 
when studying contexts of indigenous revivalism.
To be sure, many Khoisan revivalists, particularly, though certainly not 
exclusively, those who have enjoyed university education, hold that ‘accuracy’ 
is the best way of establishing the verisimilitude that is required for authen­
ticity. Such an attitude is reflected in references to ‘ancient cultural practices’, 
‘fake chiefs’, or ‘opportunistic claims’, to name but a few examples. Khoisan 
revivalists are of course rarely consciously choosing whether or not to be ‘accu­
rate’. Indigenous revivalism is also never a slavish reconstruction of the past 
in every possible detail. Moreover, what is considered accurate or authentic 
is subjective and changes over time. ‘Being accurate’ might also be considered 
more important in the context of an entitlement claim than that of a cultural

performance. Viewed as emic parameters, authenticity, accuracy, and veri­
similitude all matter, but the degree to which they are callibrated can differ, 
and they are rarely taken as absolutes. Indeed, as I have shown in Chapter 6 in 
particular in relation to notions of ‘continuity’ and ‘change’, being accurate –​ 
whichever way it is interpreted –​ is simply valued differently among Khoisan 
revivalists. All the while, in a context of therapeutic history, verisimilitude 
needs to be distanced (but not entirely removed) from notions of accuracy. 
It cannot afford putting accuracy above all else in pursuit of authenticity, as 
an academic historian or critic might be inclined to do. Easing the emphasis 
on accuracy allows many Khoisan revivalists to pursue ‘wellness’ without hav­
ing to overthink whether what they are doing is accurate. Cursory knowledge 
often already goes a long way. One example that comes to mind here is the fact 
that for most the fact of engaging with Khoekhoegowab or mastering a con­
cise vocabulary generates just as much authenticity as it does for those that 
seek to speak it as accurately or fluently as possible. Language itself is ascribed 
an empowering and decolonizing potential (see also Wa Thiong’o 1986, 15). 
Perhaps it was this ‘inaccuracy’ that made the performance of Bradley van 
Sitters at the 2019 State of the Union Address all the more authentic as an act 
of Khoisan revivalism.
Indeed, what matters most of all is whether the experience generates 
authenticity for Khoisan revivalists. This is why Khoisan revivalists view the 
Khoisan extinction discourse, both in the sense of ‘archive’ as well as socie­
tal attitudes, not as something to replicate or deliberately counter but as 
a set of tools that can be moulded in ways that best fit present purposes. To 
be sure, this is a risky endeavour and every such appropriation comes with a 
price. ngo s might for instance be more inclined to cater to those that embody 
‘Kalahari San stereotypes’ or go along with the Khoisan extinction discourse, 
but those same notions become reinforced, at least to some extent, with every 
such interactions as well, thereby enshrining them further as criteria to qualify 
for assistance or recognition (see also Sylvain 2014, 260). However, rather than 
a colonial legacy or a top-​down discourse with clear boundaries, the Khoisan 
extinction discourse is perhaps best understood as a ‘repertory set down by 
colonial experience’, a wide range of materials, ideas, and images shaped by 
various Khoisan and non-​Khoisan actors for different reasons (Forte 2005, 214). 
Edward Fischer (1999, 488) identified a ‘cultural logic’ in this regard: a set of 
assumptions and expectations that ‘changes much more slowly than surface 
makers of identity’, always constraining (though not preventing) innovations 
over the long term. In relation to this ‘repertory’ or ‘cultural logic’, authentic­
ity is not a ‘a problem projected onto them’ (Bell 2014a, 26) but a quality that 
is shaped with a certain degree of agency as well, which is of course never

absolute (cf. Ortner 2006, 152; see also Ashcroft 2015, 416). The goal of Khoisan 
revivalists is indeed to use existing tropes to their advantage in political set­
tings and beyond; it is not to pretend that such representations do not exist or 
to devote all efforts at countering them.
The literature on tourism and museums not only identifies instances of 
repressive authenticity but equally cases where indigenous people balance 
catering to tourists and visitors via stereotypes with creating awareness about 
their grievances and spreading critiques of their own (see e.g. Harkin 2003, 
853; Amoamo 2011, 1268; Gibson 2012, 214; Cassel and Maureira 2017, 8–​9; 
Ruhanen and Whitford 2019, 181). Stereotypes can be challenged, played with, 
reinvented, and even turned into sources for indigenous revivalism in their 
own right. As I noted, Khoisan-​run guided tours and museums motivated 
by precisely such aims have already materialized. Stereotypical imagery and 
stigmas can also be transformed into tools of empowerment (see also McGee 
2008, 115). Despite being increasingly seen as highly offensive, terms such as 
‘Hotnot’ are still sometimes used as insults (cf. Kiewit 2019). However, they 
are also emerging as terms of endearment among the Khoisan themselves (cf. 
Besten 2011b, 176, 188; Øvernes 2019, 199). Khoisan revivalists are still invested 
in debunking stereotypes, but the affective potential of these types of sub­
versive engagements can be profound. Patrick Mellet (2010, 225) warned 
Khoisan revivalists they might be unknowingly ‘buying into the primitivism 
paradigm of the ‘Noble Native’. While I take his point, it has to be noted that 
not everyone sees such ideas as necessarily disempowering or their actions 
as reifications of primitivism. This explains for instance why one of William 
Ellis’ (2012, 23–​24) research participants stated that ‘nature was exactly where 
they wanted to be placed’ and why many of my interlocutors too stressed the 
importance of being in touch with nature. Focusing on the fact that ‘a major 
source [of inspiration] are precisely those middle-​class whites who have 
essentialized the San’ might be short-​sighted (Gordon 2014, 112). The use of 
stereotypes for instance did not bother Rochey Walters one bit when design­
ing apparel and other products for his company Khoi Kulcha. As I discussed 
in Chapter 6, rather than seeking to move as far away as possible from what 
might be regarded as stereotypes, he works with them to produce a form of 
authenticity that is both accessible and fashionable. Walters uses those sym­
bols because they assist in establishing the verisimilitude required for an 
authentic experience, but he incorporates various other cultural markers in 
his designs as well. Like I showed with regards to hip hop or jazz, Khoi Kulcha 
emerges as an articulation of Khoisan authenticity that is just as potent as 
those articulations seeking to emphasize accuracy or continuity with the 
past, if not more so.

Chapter 7
Indeed, trying to replicate the past seldom does the job, as it impedes adapt­
ing it to present needs. Lowenthal argues on this basis that revivals have a 
greater potential to embody authenticity than the ‘original’, as ‘the revivalist 
perfects [the genius of the past] in the spirit of his own time’ (Lowenthal 2015, 
20, 518; see also MacCannell 1973, 598–​599). Acknowledging inaccuracies or 
the fact of reconstruction –​ both of which Khoisan revivalists regularly do –​ 
does not hamper the quest for, or experience of, authenticity either (see also 
Chhabra, Healy, and Sills 2003, 716). If authenticity is a result of cultural pro­
cesses of reification, then the more people believe that something is authentic, 
a satisfactory ‘fit between idea and ideal’, as Niezen put it (Niezen 2009, 185–​
186), the more it becomes an established model for emulation and perhaps 
ceases to be an act of revival altogether (see also Saxton 2020, 132; Cohen 1988, 
379). Whether the rieldans was danced by the Khoisan in 17th Cape Town or 
not, it is a staple expression of Khoisan revivalism today. In practice, accuracy, 
verisimilitude and authenticity are then all calibrated to suit present needs and 
herein lies the subversive dimension. What is unknown can also be imagined. 
As Greg Denning noted, ‘imagination’ does not mean ‘fantasy’ but ‘finding a 
word that others will hear, a metaphor that someone else will see’ (Dening 
2007, 101). Indeed, while the end might justify the means, verisimilitude 
remains key. Mark Auslander (2013, 163) showed in this regard how ‘sensual 
contact with physical objects that stand in for historical artefacts’ in the con­
text of historical re-​enactments have the potential to deliver on ‘the promise 
of coming into direct, intimate contact with past persons and past epochs’ (see 
also Lowenthal 2015, 387, 389). They create a ‘ritual performative field of affec­
tive transformation’, which in turn cultivates a sensation of being ‘in touch’ 
with the past (Auslander 2013, 164). Simulacra or not, the felt sensation of the 
past is manifestly authentic. Khoisan revivalism is not a re-​enactment; it deals 
with the core of one’s being. Nevertheless, Auslander’s observations resonate 
with the way Khoisan revivalists relate to traditional attire, for instance: while 
opinions vary, clothing is considered authentic as long as it emulates Khoisan-​
ness, not necessarily depending on how ‘accurate’ it is.
The topic of clothing is well-​suited to bringing home one of the factors 
that makes such authenticity ‘subversive’. What is being subverted by Khoisan 
revivalists is in many cases the notion of repressive authenticity itself. In their 
expression of agency, they accomplish precisely the opposite: they do not just 
‘counter’ it –​ thereby still ‘responding’ to it and letting it dominate their authen­
ticity, they cultivate an authenticity where what could be considered repressive 
in a certain context is appropriated, reified, or simply disregarded depending 
on what best suits present needs. Note here that I am not commenting on the 
outcomes of such ‘subversive’ actions, which is a matter I revisit below. Indeed,

Khoisan Revivalism and the Therapeutics of Emic History
305
Khoisan revivalism most of all displaces the Khoisan extinction discourse as 
the prime source for Khoisan representation and complements it with various 
other sources that are just as potent to bring about verisimilitude and accom­
plish the aims of therapeutic history. It for instance did not matter to Mackie 
whether his clothing was made out of real leopard skin. Through their verisi­
militude, his animal skins operated as a ‘time machine’ all the same. The same 
goes for the recreated huts in !Khwa ttu or those that are regularly erected at 
the Castle of Good Hope. Whether Krotoa was sexually assaulted or not, the 
fact that such a historical interpretation resonates with so many Khoisan reviv­
alists is what makes it an authentic representation of the past for them. The 
band Topdog sa created powerful expressions of Khoisan revivalism by using 
modern and traditional Khoisan instruments alike. Although many contest the 
term ‘Khoisan’ for reasons I explained in the Introduction, the fact that most 
Khoisan revivalists find meaning in it and disregard its historical baggage, as 
well as the debates among historians and archaeologists, might be taken as an 
instance of subversive authenticity as well (see also Solomon 2014, 733).
I could give various other examples, but I want to underline another sub­
versive consequence of the way Khoisan revivalists shape their authenticity: it 
prompts academics to not solely focus on political empowerment, deconstruc­
tionist critiques, or the dangers of reification but to also consider how such 
processes can cater to identity needs. Many academics have indeed struggled 
with these kinds of ‘subversive authenticities’ and have resorted to fram­
ing indigenous revivalism as inescapably, mistakenly, or regrettably filtered 
through the (historically) dominant Eurocentric bias (see e.g. Friedman 1992, 
843; Conklin 1997, 729; see also Keesing 1989; 1991; Trask 1991). Andrew Lattas 
(1992, 161) was disappointed in Australian academia in the 1990s for seemingly 
being unable to conceive of Aboriginal identities as anything but reifications 
of Western stereotypes and racial ideas. It seemed to him that his colleagues 
would rather have Aborigines ‘embrace themselves as pure simulacrums. They 
are to recognize themselves as an artifice, as a fabrication of the state’ (Lattas 
1993, 247). Lattas (1992,162; 1993, 246) emphasized that ‘essentialism should not 
be essentialised’ –​ it can be just as empowering as disempowering (see also 
Grossman and Cuthbert 1998, 113; Spiegel 2020, 150). Those drawn to essen­
tialisms are not necessarily ‘essentialist’ (i.e. opportunistically ‘flattening dif­
ference’ or mobilizing ‘fakes’) (Sayer 1997, 456). Khoisan revivalists also do not 
engage in strategic essentialism to cover up their ‘true’ socioeconomic aims, as 
some have suggested is typical of strategic essentialism (see e.g. Sylvain 2014, 
258). They do not distinguish between socioeconomic goals and cultural strug­
gles; the two are in fact enmeshed in the Khoisan identity discourse (see also 
Fraser 1995; Young 1997, 148; Coulthard 2014, 19). Indeed, as Avril Bell (2014a,

Chapter 7
120–​121) pointed out, contrary to what Gayatri Spivak, who coined the term, 
believed, if those claiming indigeneity engage in strategic essentialism, what 
is mobilized is intended as an outcome, not as an object for eventual decon­
struction (see below). Lattas (1992, 163) too related essentialism to authenticity 
and affect, rather than a calculated political strategy. What is important there­
fore, he concludes, is to let indigenous people pursue ‘a sense of ownership of 
oneself’ and ‘regain some control over the conceptual terrain from which one 
speaks’, so they can ‘symbolically place themselves outside the discourses and 
memories owned by Europeans’ (Lattas 1993, 247, 250, 254).
As I have shown, the authenticity which Khoisan revivalists cultivate is not 
necessarily located outside European ‘discourses and memories’, but this is 
perhaps proof that it is truly liberating. As Charles Taylor argued, one needs to 
be able to move beyond existing patterns and make variations on a theme to 
experience an authentic self (Taylor 1992, 62–​63). There is something empow­
ering in being freed from an incessant push to counter, reject, or respond to, 
and instead shape one’s authenticity from whichever precolonial, colonial, 
anti-​colonial, or postcolonial source one deems meaningful (Escárcega 2010, 
21–​22; Eze 2010, 30, 48, 151; Cowlishaw 2012, 411; LeFevre 2013, 137; Bell 2014a, 
128, 200). As Bill Ashcroft (2001, 6) points out, such ‘[t]‌ransformation is not 
contrary to resistance, but it reveals that the most effective strategies of post-​
colonial resistance have not become bogged down in simple opposition or 
futile binarism [i.e. colonial vs. anti-​colonial], but have taken the dominant 
discourse and transformed it for purposes of self-​empowerment’. Adaption, 
pluralism, and creativity is crucial for indigenous survival and depriving them 
of that through repressive authenticity supresses their ability to exert their 
agency (Reid 2013, 59; Ashcroft 2015, 417; Coburn 2016, 297). International leg­
islation on indigenous people prioritizes self-​determination and the right to 
‘revitalize culture’ for this reason (Maddison 2013, 292; Hirsch 2015, 110–​111). If 
conceptualizing a singular Khoisan category against which to recover authen­
ticity could be seen as a token of repressive authenticity, then there might 
very well be a decolonizing dimension to articulations that generate multiple 
Khoisan identities and authenticities that do not conform (solely) to the rules 
stipulated by others (Wolfe 1999, 183; Aschcroft 2002, 2, 35; Sissons 2005, 143, 
149; Paradies 2006, 362). Such perspectives also recast the repressive authen­
ticity surrounding urban-​based indigeneity, as they frame places like Cape 
Town as creative hubs, ‘a powerful site of cultural (re)affirmation’ and exper­
imentation with indigeneity (Hill 2012a, 256; Maddison 2013, 300; Nyseth and 
Pedersen 2014, 147; Busbridge 2016, 517).
James Clifford (2013, 279) studied indigenous revivals throughout his career 
and remarked in 2013 that anthropology was still struggling to come to grips

Khoisan Revivalism and the Therapeutics of Emic History

with ‘a reweaving of old and new […] something our holistic concepts of 
culture, identity, and historical development are ill equipped to recognize’. 
While I would agree that the same applies to my case, several authors have 
begun to shift the research away from mistrusting reconstructed identities as 
tainted by colonial categories, to seeing them as expressions of agency. June 
Bam-​Hutchison, who has worked extensively on Khoisan revivalism, opts for 
‘occupy’ instead of ‘de-​colonial’ in this context because the former is not ‘a 
response’ but a ‘self-​determined social agency […] to claim without explana­
tion’ (Bam-​Hutchison 2016, 25, original emphasis). Through what he terms a 
‘decolonial interpretation’, Itunu Bodunrin (2018, 91, 103, 177) also concluded 
that his interlocutors in Platfontein in the Northern Cape were ‘metaphorically 
reclaiming and reworking [their] identities to highlight contemporary socio-​
economic issues, needs and realities’ and striving towards ‘self-​representation 
and authoring their own narratives’, both in the private, public, and digital 
spheres. Ana Deumert and Justin Brown (2017, 589) have similarly observed 
that ‘authenticity’ in Khoisan revivalism is not achieved by ‘following a pre-​
existing script’ but by ‘drawing on a shifting repertoire of semiotic forms’. They 
conclude that ‘[d]‌iscourses on purism and authenticity are conspicuous by 
their absence: being Khoisan is not only about that which has been lost […], 
but even more so [about] creative agency’ (ibid., 591).
While I encourage further research along these lines, the ‘creative agency’ 
inherent in therapeutic history and subversive authenticity is not simply an 
empowering feature. These analytical frameworks also raise various conun­
drums related to the politics of entitlement and the intellectual and political 
accommodation of Khoisan revivalism. As I explain next, this is indeed why 
I placed a question mark after the title of this section –​ ‘Subversive authentic­
ity’: repressive authenticity turned inside out? –​ and alluded several times to the 
political ramifications of tensions between therapeutic history and academic 
history. I do not aim to resolve these conundrums, but an analysis of the ther­
apeutics of history would not be complete if I did not address them in relation 
to the South African context.

Closing Reflections on the Therapeutics of Emic History
Thus far I have showed how therapeutic history and subversive authenticity 
help explain why and how Khoisan revivalists engage with the past, and what 
role authenticity has in the process. Subversive authenticity problematizes 
the relation between their identity constructions and the Khoisan extinction 
discourse. The main premise of this discourse, that is, that the Khoisan are

virtually extinct, is certainly dismantled and no group benefits more from 
this than Khoisan revivalists in Cape Town, who conform the least to repre­
sentations cast in the mould of repressive authenticity. Pursuing a subversive 
authenticity allows Khoisan revivalists to articulate their indigeneity how 
they prefer; liberating them from an emphasis on either explicitly rejecting 
or replicating colonial representations. It allows them to strive towards the 
‘wellness’ that is cherished in emic histories, i.e. the relatability and historical 
continuity at the core of Khoisan revivalism. Engaging in therapeutic history 
aligns priorities with regards to knowledge validation, source criticism and 
objectivity in ways that best accommodate these aims. Early on I likened ther­
apeutic history to ‘heritage’ as ways of engaging with the past that have much 
in common. However, it is worth revisiting some of these features of heritage, 
subversive authenticity and therapeutic history in light of the conundrums 
they pose with regards to Khoisan revivalism’s societal, intellectual and polit­
ical accommodation.
Lowenthal (1998, 78) understood the empowering potential of heritage 
very well when he observed that ‘[h]‌istory is still mostly written by the win­
ners. But heritage increasingly belong to the losers’. Yet it is true that in his 
work he is undoubtedly more critical towards ‘heritage’ than he is towards 
‘history’. I do not want to get side-​tracked by speculating on what might have 
motivated him to be more critical towards heritage as such, but I will distil 
some of his and others’ commentary in this regard as they help evaluate some 
of the challenges that arise from the way many Khoisan revivalists engage 
with the past. It seems to me that a central problem relates to the role of 
criticism. As Lowenthal (ibid., 120) put it: ‘Testable truth is history’s chief 
hallmark. Historians’ credibility depends on their sources being open to gen­
eral scrutiny’. As he and others have noted, heritage does not have the same 
inclination towards ‘openness’. In fact, I have argued that one of the prereq­
uisites of Khoisan revivalism is the experience of being known as Coloured. 
This experience guides much of Khoisan revivalists’ engagements with the 
past and the claims of entitlement that flow from it. Linking experience to 
historical understanding poses certain challenges. In what he identifies as 
‘historical wounds’, that is, specific articulations of past events that highlight 
their traumatic resonance, Dipesh Chakrabarty (2007, 79–​81) notes that an 
‘experiential access to the past’ is often at the core. This frustrates many aca­
demic historians, who generally eschew experience as a mode of historical 
understanding because it is considered too subjective to count as evidence. 
The ‘truth’ underlying historical wounds is not ‘verifiable by historians’, who 
are only able to ascertain the validity of ‘historical truths’, ‘broad, synthetic 
generalizations based on researched collections of individual historical facts

[…] open to empirical verification’ (ibid., 77–​78). This problem presents itself 
most sharply when ‘historical wounds’ are presented as ‘historical truths’. 
Indeed, while most Khoisan revivalists do not hold absolutist views about the 
past or their own identities, they do not see their views as just one perspective 
among many. It is fair to posit that they in fact regard their interpretations of 
the past as more ‘truthful’ than those expressed in ‘historical truths’, as these 
have been stacked against them for centuries.
It is therefore one thing to point out that the type of history academic his­
torians produce does not mirror that which is generally desired in a context 
of indigenous revivalism (see e.g. Callinicos 1991, 22; Foner 1995, 171), it is 
quite another to understand how they overlap and emerge in hybrid forms. 
The problem with ‘hybrids’ is that, to a large extent, it becomes impossible 
to judge Khoisan revivalists’ engagements with the past on the same basis 
as ‘historical truths’. In the eyes of many Khoisan revivalists, their views on 
the past hold the same, if not greater authority than those from academics, 
but they do not want to be held to the same standards of criticism, as these 
could be considered tokens of repressive authenticity. As Joan Scott (1992, 
18) notes, there are two exclusionary aspects to taking membership of a spe­
cific group as ‘authority enough for one’s speech […] the only test of true 
knowledge’: ‘all those not of the group are denied even intellectual access to 
it, and those within the group whose experiences or interpretations do not 
conform to the established terms of identity must either suppress their views 
or drop out’. In foregrounding experience, differences between ‘sources’ and 
‘methods’ dissolve, making it hard for those without a valid claim to that 
experience to scrutinize their engagements with the past. In privileging a 
certain kind of bias that is only available through experience, the resulting 
histories can moreover mirror the topological biases that have long been 
criticized in academic history-​writing (Confino 2011, 43; Lowenthal 1998, 
89). The peer-​reviewed authenticity and ‘auto-​history’ that Niezen (2009, 
xvi, 172–​173) placed at the core of therapeutic history makes the notion of 
authenticity and history more democratic, but he also fears that, when taken 
to ‘extremes’, it can lead to ‘exclusivism and political intolerance’. I did not 
discern such ‘extremes’ in Khoisan revivalism beyond the politics of entitle­
ment. In fact, as I noted in Chapter 5, Khoisan revivalism puts forth a rather 
inclusive set of criteria for Khoisan identity and gives rise to a wide variety of 
articulations of indigeneity as a result.
While I do not see many signs of what Niezen and Scott fear in therapeu­
tic history reflected in Khoisan revivalism, these could become more apparent 
in the future, particularly if Khoisan revivalism gains more political traction. 
Perhaps this is indeed behind the reluctance of the South African government

to grant the Khoisan the status of indigenous people (see Conclusion). 
Inescapably, entitlement claims, whether related to land, traditional leader­
ship or something else, need to be scrutinized by positing at least some marker 
of (historical) reference; which will be permanently contested through both 
the lenses of ‘history’ and ‘heritage’. As the South African case shows, where 
history’s public role as an arbiter of historical criticism has receded to the back­
ground in favour of heritage (Comaroff 2005, 126–​128), hegemonic interpreta­
tions of the past in practice emanate mostly from the most powerful groups. 
While the trc strove to be as inclusive as possible through its constellation of 
multiple truths, it too ultimately made a choice to emphasize plurality over a 
more positivist interpretation of the past. And yet, as I noted at the beginning 
of this chapter, this recognition of a ‘healing’ truth by acknowledging multi­
ple ‘truths’ left various parties aggrieved and unaccommodated by heritage’s 
ascribed therapeutic virtues. As I suggested previously, what Khoisan revival­
ists, and indeed processes of therapeutic history, desire is then something of a 
hybrid between history (with its attached authority and claim to objectivity) 
and heritage; something which I have loosely referred to as ‘emic history’ –​ a 
concept that is certainly in need of more elaboration to function as a proper 
analytical tool.
In the Conclusion I share some thoughts on how this insight might inform 
future policy developments, but it is important to appreciate how the ten­
sions between ‘history’ and ‘heritage’ in Khoisan revivalists’ emic histories 
are scrutinized in academia. Calls to recognize the non-​academic ways 
indigenous people might engage with the past as histories in their own right 
are easy enough to make (see e.g. Clark et al. 2018, 511), it is quite another 
to consider how this brings tensions between emic and etic ‘approaches to 
the past’ into focus: ignoring ‘Native epistemologies’ is not an option as that 
would render them invalid, but sparing them from criticism for the sake of 
political correctness augments their ‘difference’ from conventional history-​
writing (Jacoby 2013, 60, 63–​64). Such a position ultimately implies that the 
histories of indigenous people are radically different from those of others, 
which generates the problems related to experience I mentioned earlier. Yin 
Paradies has raised similar concerns, noting that an uncritical view on indig­
enous people and the way they engage with the past can render indigeneity 
‘synonymous with suffering and marginality’ and relate this ‘victimhood’ to a 
‘privileged access to social truths’ (Paradies 2006, 360; see also Schwab 2010, 
19; Furedi 2004, 149–​150, 173). Most importantly, such an approach ‘fails to 
recognize that engaging in debate with indigenous people is a sign of intel­
lectual respect’ and that it risks turning a blind eye to inaccuracies, general­
izations or blatant manipulations (Paradies 2006, 360). According to Niezen

(2009, 155, 175), this ultimately leads to a ‘largely unrecognized dilemma fac­
ing both academic communities and those attempting in practical ways to 
promote the emotional recovery of the dispossessed and excluded’: ‘to what 
extent should one promote, ignore, or critically engage with the collective 
self-​knowledge of marginalized peoples that dispenses with widely recog­
nized academic procedures?’. Niezen (ibid., 173) seems to favour a critical 
stance: ‘The therapeutic criterion of accepted knowledge limits the possi­
bilities for historical self-​criticism, for open, honest encounter with uncom­
fortable events, attitudes, and attributes. It enables historical distortion or 
amnesia’. While he goes on to add that it hampers reconciliation efforts, he 
also recognizes that the excesses of therapeutic history are perhaps a ‘nec­
essary aspect or outcome of a process of recovery from the traumas and cul­
tural effacements of colonial domination [which] takes precedence over the 
pursuit of truth and the wider consequences of politically bounded knowl­
edge’ (ibid., 174).
Contemplating the notion that Khoisan revivalism might be undergoing a 
phase, or constitute a phase itself is an appropriate way to conclude this chap­
ter. Niezen is not the first to suggest that decolonization takes place in phases. 
One of the first to do so was Frantz Fanon. Fanon (2008 [1952], 4) believed 
that colonized people suffered from ‘the epidermalization of inferiority’. 
Accepting themselves as less-​than, the colonized hopelessly imitate the cul­
ture of the colonizer, which only causes further ‘depersonalization’ as the col­
onizer never assimilates the colonized as an equal (Fanon 1994 [1964], 38, 53). 
The contradictions inherent in this assimilationist dialectic ultimately push 
the colonized to revisit the past the colonizer has worked to suppress (Fanon 
2005 [1961], 149). This is done with a vengeance: ‘This culture, abandoned, 
sloughed off, rejected, despised, becomes for the inferiorized an object of 
passionate attachment’ (Fanon 1994 [1964], 41–​42). While Fanon ultimately 
advocated for a critical examination of such pasts and much of his work cri­
tiques this part of the dialectic (Nielsen 2013, 448; Coulthard 2014, 114–​115, see 
below), he believed that a phase ‘overvaluation’ was necessary as the colo­
nized culture had been deprived of any life: ‘The oppressed goes into ecstasies 
over each rediscovery. The wonder is permanent’ (Fanon 1994 [1964],41–​42; 
2005 [1961], 158). The difference with the colonized culture is exaggerated to 
extremes and it becomes the foundational pillar of one’s identity and the ral­
lying point for the anti-​colonial struggle (Fanon 2008 [1952], 7). Most effective 
in this process of ‘counter-​assimilation’ is the ‘oldest, inner essence, the far­
thest removed from colonial times’ (Fanon 2005 [1961],148; 1994 [1959], 42). 
This brings to mind Niezen’s (2009, 185–​186) hypothesis that the greater the 
devastation, the more ‘utopian’ ideals are projected into the past. Others have

Chapter 7
also described this ‘refuge’ into the past as a requirement to start ‘a period of 
healing and regaining strength’ after colonialism (Gilroy 1993, 188–​189). This 
phase can also allow the group in question to ‘solidify and develop its own 
distinctive voice, signature, discursive practices, and other unique features’ 
(Nielsen 2013, 349). According to Fanon, this stage eventually gives way to the 
synthesis of the ‘new human’, where the previously colonized attain ‘freedom’ 
by accepting the ambiguous legacies that make up their identities (Schwab 
2010, 108). Aside from the more positive markers of identity, dislocation, loss, 
dispossession, disruption all become part of the experience of an authentic 
decolonized self (Povinelli 2002, 49). This final phase achieves ‘decoloni­
zation’ as indigenous identities are no longer determined by the ‘objectify­
ing gaze and assimilative lure’ of the colonizer, and they are instead able to 
engage with the past in ways that best suits their needs (Coulthard 2014, 43, 
156–​157). This turning away from colonial legacies amounts to a form of self-​
recognition and self-​realization (Balaton-​Chimes and Stead 2017, 12). Fanon 
(2008 [1952], 179) himself put it best of all in a couple of famous lines in Black 
Skin White Masks: ‘I am not a prisoner of history. I should not seek there for 
the meaning of my destiny. I should constantly remind myself that the real 
leap consists in introducing invention into existence. In the world through 
which I travel, I am endlessly creating myself’.
I wonder where Khoisan revivalism fits within this scheme or whether this 
dialectic is perhaps irrelevant alltogether. I can think of arguments either way. 
The more extravagant claims or actions of Khoisan revivalists might indicate 
that it is still in the ‘overvaluation’ phase. During fieldwork I frequently got 
the impression that Khoisan revivalists felt that they had to assert themselves 
in the intellectual and political landscape with a particular rigour because 
of the salience of the Khoisan extinction discourse and their political mar­
ginalization. I have noted at length how features such the wearing of animal 
skins, the speaking of Khoekhoegowab or the celebration of Khoisan ‘heroes’ 
are meaningful acts of Khoisan revivalism, but they simultaneously at times 
struck me as a means of asserting presence in ways that resembles the emo­
tions that Fanon and others described. These two observations of course do no 
contradict each other, but they do show why it is difficult to place of placing 
Khoisan revivalism in a certain ‘phase’. The same holds for entitlement claims. 
On the one hand, Khoisan revivalists themselves have considered that actions 
such as claiming ‘all the land’, castigating government officials during public 
hearings or even declaring secession might be deliberate exaggerations to 
make themselves heard more than anything else (see also Hirsh 2015). Then 
again, most of their claims are not metaphoric and I also do not want to make 
excuses for excesses by dismissing them as ‘growing pains’. As I noted, Niezen

implicitly argued that therapeutic history was a temporary phenomenon as its 
features were ultimately untenable and its excesses morally unacceptable. Yet 
he does not explain what follows therapeutic history. For that matter, when 
does Khoisan revivalism cease to be a project of ‘revivalism’? I revisit this ques­
tion in the Conclusion but suffice it to say that I do not have the answer. I have 
argued instead that the subversive authenticity that emerges in Khoisan reviv­
alism is certainly a sign that it is setting out to achieve its goals. How I have 
described subversive authenticity certainly resonates with what the above-​
mentioned authors have suggested as characteristics of the synthesis the dia­
lectic leads up to.
Does this indicate that Khoisan revivalism has progressed through the dia­
lectic and come out the other side? It depends who you ask, I suppose. Some 
would argue that subversive authenticity is an unattainable state, an illogi­
cal concept. Critics such as Ciraj Rassool (2009, 107, 115) would likely not see 
the reification of stereotypes as unavoidable collateral damage, but as a sign 
that Khoisan revivalism remains ‘the reinvention of ethnicity in the name of 
Indigenousness […] [A]‌ rebirth and recoding of ethnography and colonial iden­
tities rather than their transcendence’. To be fair, Rassool (ibid., 115) is aware 
that his observations pertain in particular to those Khoisan revivalists who 
advance entitlement claims, and I have to varying degrees agreed with his and 
others’ observations regarding this aspect of Khoisan revivalism. Nevertheless, 
I would posit that he maintains that Khoisan revivalism is ultimately a self-​
defeating strategy in light of his alignment to the non-​racialist school of 
thought in South Africa, which I mentioned briefly in the Introduction and say 
more about in the Conclusion. In short, it advocates that ethnic identity ought 
to play a smaller role in our lives, if any at all. Khoisan revivalism indicates, to 
me at least, that ethnic identity is not exactly on the way out, for better and 
worse. More importantly, however, I would argue that Rassool’s analysis con­
flates top-​down apartheid-​era manipulations of ethnicity with the retrieval of 
identity from-​below. As I noted, this does not mean that subversive authen­
ticity or therapeutic history are unambiguously empowering or that it does 
not at times replicate colonialist representations, but it does indicate their 
effectiveness in aiding their practitioners to better comprehend what is (not) 
at stake in processes of indigenous revivalism. Lastly, I cannot help but feel 
awkward about academics, whose discipline has been historically complicit in 
the Khoisan extinction discourse, now using sophisticated critiques in the first 
place to discount those who are recovering their identities and cultures after 
colonialism and apartheid (see also Lattas 1993, 244–​245). Note here that I am 
not absolving myself either, or suggesting that there is no room for criticism. 
There is, however, certainly something to be said for ‘turning the ‘gaze’ back

on the questioner’, as questioning identity, whether by academics or non-​aca­

has convinced anyone to ‘turn the gaze’ onto themselves in this regard and to 
reflect on how groups like Khoisan revivalists construe post-​colonial identities, 
it has already accomplished a great deal.

Conclusion
Khoisan Consciousness and Its Discontents in a Post-​transitional 
South Africa
These weak people, the most helpless, and in their present condi­
tion perhaps the most wretched of the human race, duped out of 
their possessions, their country, and finally out of their liberty, have 
entailed upon their miserable offspring a state of existence to which 
that of slavery might bear the comparison of happiness. It is a con­
dition, however, not likely to continue to a very remote posterity. 
The name Hottentots will be forgotten or remembered only as that 
of a deceased person of little note […] [W]‌herever Europeans have 
colonized, the less civilized natives have always dwindled away, and 
at length totally disappeared.
john barrow (1801, 144)
…
We have risen up. We have begun to initiate healing practices, our 
own traditional healing sessions. We came to the realization that we 
have our ancestors, we have the ancient knowledge, we have power, 
we have our beingness. We are determined to heal and we have that 
ability. By gaining the insight and understanding to what we have 
become, can we go back and be who we really are. In understanding 
our pain, we can begin to heal. In dying to what we have become, 
can we be who we really are. In dying I became me!

When the British colonial administrator, geographer, and travel writer John 
Barrow foretold the impending demise of the ‘Hottentots’, he expressed a 
widely held belief at the time. While the seeds of this prognosis were sown 
during the period of Dutch colonialism, it was particularly from the 19th cen­
tury onward that the Khoisan were gauged to have ‘dwindled away’, if not 
‘totally disappeared’ as a distinct collective because of their assimilation into

Conclusion
colonial society and their dispossession and decimation at the hands of colonial 
aggressors. Save for a few pockets in the remote Kalahari Desert who drew the 
attention of racial scientists and salvage anthropologists, the ‘Khoisan extinc­
tion discourse’ effectively disavowed any meaningful contemporary Khoisan 
presence. In the eyes of most, South African history proceeded as a protracted 
clash between White and Black. The Khoisan were co-​opted into colonial soci­
ety as a Christianised labour force and amalgamated under the racial category 
‘Coloured’ by the apartheid regime in the 1950s, a label that endures as a semi-​
official classification. African identity, not least related to the Khoisan, was 
violently supressed among Coloureds by the apartheid dispensation and they 
were instead encouraged to embrace their European ancestry. Nowhere has 
this assimilationist push left more traces than in Cape Town, where residents 
likely would have agreed with Barrow up until the end of apartheid. Indeed, 
in the late 1990s something occurred that few predicted, least of all Barrow 
himself: the supposedly vanished Khoisan ‘reappeared’. Increasing numbers of 
Coloureds began to identify as Khoisan and stake various claims on behalf of 
their newfound identification as indigenous people. While Khoisan identity 
had not been completely ‘erased’, it took great effort to reintroduce Khoisan 
identity into the private and public sphere. As the Eastern Cape-​based activist 
Jean Burgess explained during a presentation at an indigenous people’s confer­
ence in Norway in 2007, people like her had to ‘die to what they have become’ 
by shedding their Coloured identity. Only then could they ‘heal’, comprehend 
the potency of their past, realize who they ‘really are’, and ultimately ‘rise up’. 
What she describes is therefore appropriately referred to as ‘Khoisan revival­
ism’, or as I have defined it:
The increasing affinity towards, and politicization of, the Khoisan in post-​
apartheid South Africa, deriving mostly from a critical interrogation of 
the identity label Coloured, especially among those currently classified 
as such, whereby some (re)claim Khoisan identities, indigenous status 
and/​or land and leadership titles.
Ever since I became interested in Khoisan revivalism, I have tried to grasp 
what role ‘emic histories’ play in this process. That the past is central to indig­
enous revivalism is a moot point, but it is less evident to explain how and why 
it is engaged with in specific ways. Accordingly, I chose the following cen­
tral research question: why and how do Khoisan revivalists engage with the 
past? Not only is ethnographic research among Khoisan revivalists rare, but 
the existing literature mostly focuses on the political dimensions of Khoisan 
revivalism and the ‘instrumentalist’ uses of Khoisan identity, leaving various

questions related to other emic uses of the past unaddressed. Across several

been on understanding the emic perspectives of Khoisan revivalists through 
interviewing, participant observation, and collecting various types of relevant 
documentation. Due to the centrality of ‘indigeneity’ in Khoisan revivalism, 
I took inspiration from articulation theory to unpack what the concept meant 
to Khoisan revivalists, whether in their everyday lives or their political cam­
paigns. I recap my main findings below and then revisit the loaded concept of 
indigeneity one last time.
In order to understand why and how Khoisan revivalists engage with 
the past, I began with an overview of Khoisan revivalism’s historical trajec­
tory across Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, which together make up Part 1, ‘Lost in 
Categorization? The Khoisan extinction discourse and the intellectual roots and 
aspirations of Khoisan revivalism’. Keeping in mind my definition of Khoisan 
revivalism as a post-​apartheid phenomenon and the fact that Khoisan identity 
never ‘disappeared’, I showed how its intellectual roots are partially located in 
the rejection of Coloured identity in favour of a Black political identity, as prac­
ticed in particular by certain anti-​apartheid activists during the 1980s. As I dis­
cuss in more detail below when arguing why it is productive to think through 
Khoisan revivalism’s societal accommodation with the concept of ‘Khoisan 
Consciousness’, this rejection of Coloured identity was partially inspired by 
Steve Biko’s Black Consciousness philosophy, which postulated ‘Black’ as a polit­
ical identity based on shared discrimination, rather than skin pigmentation or 
ethnicity. The rejection of Coloured identity paved the way for Coloureds to 
embrace their African heritage. A similar critique of Eurocentrism was being 
developed at the time among those shaping a revisionist Khoisan historiogra­
phy at institutions of higher learning in South Africa and abroad. The historian 
Henry Bredekamp at uwc in Cape Town played a particularly pivotal role, as 
he was instrumental in organizing two Khoisan-​themed conferences that pro­
pelled Khoisan revivalism into the intellectual and public sphere.
Indeed, these twin currents culminated in two watershed events in the his­
tory of Khoisan revivalism: the exhibition Miscast, which deconstructed cen­
turies of Khoisan representation but in particular the 1997 Khoisan Identities 
and Cultural Heritage Conference, both held in Cape Town. The conference was 
the first large-​scale public celebration of Khoisan identity. It was also where 
Joseph Little –​ arguably the progenitor of Khoisan identity politics –​ rose to 
prominence. Together with a group of likeminded avant-​gardists, including 
Burgess, Basil Coetzee, Willa Boezak, and William Langeveldt, Little erected 
structures of traditional leadership and campaigned for official recognition of, 
and support for, his Khoisan revivalism through the Cape Cultural Heritage

Development Council (cchdc). Via the cchdc and several related short-​lived 
organizations, Little and his entourage conducted fieldwork and historical 
research in order to cultivate their own interpretations of the Khoisan past and 
spread these among the wider public. Together with the efforts of more estab­
lished Khoisan groups, primarily the Griqua, Khoisan revivalists such as Little 
were instrumental in establishing the National Khoisan Council (nkc) in 1997, 
an overarching non-​statutory body to explore the constitutional accommoda­
tion of the Khoisan, which was chaired by Little until 2011. The nkc remains 
the main Khoisan institution the South African government engages with 
regarding all matters Khoisan, despite facing criticism from many Khoisan 
revivalists for being ineffective and corrupt. It became apparent early on that 
the government was not eager to grant the Khoisan the status of indigenous 
people as defined in international legislation. Instead, it occasionally floats the 
term ‘vulnerable indigenous people’ –​ one indigenous people among many in 
South Africa, but perhaps facing particular predicaments that merit special 
measures, which usually remain unspecified. While there is no official stand­
point on this issue, it is clear that the government maintains this position to 
date (see below).
The campaign for recognition also focused on traditional leadership from 
the onset, especially after the follow-​up conference held in Oudtshoorn in 2001. 
Some seasoned Khoisan revivalists argue that the vague promises regarding 
recognition made at this conference thereafter caused infighting to break out 
among various competing factions, which continues till this day. Contestations 
over leadership positions was one of the reasons why Little receded to the 
background in the wake of the reburial of Sarah Baartman in 2002 and the 
visit of the United Nations Special Rapporteur in 2005. In the 2010s, fuelled by 
social media and the Khoisan revivalist-​authored newspaper Eerste Nasie Nuus 
(enn), people such as Zenzile Khoisan, Chantal Revell, Mackie, and Tania 
Kleinhans-​Cedras dramatically increased the reach of Khoisan revivalism, as 
well as the assertiveness of its political campaigns and engagements with the 
South African government. While Little and the cchdc had also attempted 
to recruit as many people as possible, this new cohort of Khoisan revivalists 
proved vastly more successful. It is not farfetched to consider contemporary 
Khoisan revivalism as a nascent broad-​based identity movement. Khoisan-​
themed organizations and events mushroomed across Cape Town and beyond. 
While most of these were short-​lived, they all contributed to a ripple effect, 
spreading Khoisan revivalism into various spheres of life, whether explicitly 
political or not. One of the reasons why Khoisan revivalism proliferated the 
way that it did during this time is undoubtedly related to developments regard­
ing land claims and the recognition of traditional leadership. While there are

various other components of Khoisan revivalist politics, such as language 
rights, the South African government has focused on these two topics, and they 
seemed to be the most salient among the people I engaged with as well.
In 2013, then President Jacob Zuma announced that his administration 
would reopen the land claims process that previously ran between 1995 and 
1998 and make provisions that would also allow the Khoisan to claim land. 
Aside from a few smaller settlements, two largescale land claims involving 
Khoisan communities in the Northern Cape took place in 1999 (Kgalagadi 
Transfrontier Park) and 2003 (Richtersveld), but the fact that these concerned 
Khoisan was immaterial as the claims met the criteria of the restitution pro­
gram for all South Africans, that is, the racially motivated dispossession 
took place after 1913, the year of the Natives Land Act. Zuma vowed to cre­
ate ‘exceptions’ to this cut-​off date in part because it impeded the Khoisan 
from filing their claims. A series of consultations took place to give shape to 
Zuma’s ‘exceptions’ policy, but the cut-​off date was never truly up for debate. 
The government instead vowed to prioritize the Khoisan in the land-​redis­
tribution program and to support heritage programs (see below). These two 
options had already been identified roughly fifteen years earlier and to date 
little has materialized in terms of land claims or land redistribution. While the 
Sarah Baartman Centre for Remembrance in the Eastern Cape is nearing com­
pletion after two decades of delays, the Khoisan Heritage Route, which was 
greenlighted in 1999 and criss-​crosses the country, remains unimplemented. It 
similarly remained unclear for decades how the Khoisan (traditional leader­
ship) would be constitutionally recognized. In 2011, a draft version was released 
of what in 2019 was officially signed into law as the Traditional and Khoi-​San 
Leadership Act (tkla). While some support the tkla, the vast majority of 
Khoisan revivalists are dead set against it for a variety of reasons but chiefly 
because they perceive its criteria to be too strict: it does not recognize them 
as indigenous people; it co-​opts their leadership into state-​backed Houses of 
Traditional Leaders; and it does not take into account their specific history 
and grievances. The tkla also only grants recognition to traditional leaders. 
In August 2021, four members were appointed to the ‘Commission on Khoi-​
San Matters’, which will vet Khoisan traditional leadership claims. Once the 
Commission begins its work for a period of five years, the Khoisan revivalist 
landscape might be shaken up as competing leadership claims come to a head 
and those who previously rejected the tkla might change their minds and try 
to reap its benefits after all.
I revisit these policy developments below. Suffice it to say that they informed 
much of the context of my fieldwork. In Part 2, ‘Ethnographic encounters with 
Khoisan revivalism in Cape Town’, I scrutinized my fieldwork data across three

Conclusion
chapters in order to study in greater detail how and why Khoisan revivalists 
engage with the past. Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 focus on what I have called 
the ‘Khoisan identity discourse’, that is, the ways in which Khoisan revivalists 
relate to their Khoisan identities. I explained in Chapter 4 how Khoisan reviv­
alists diagnose Coloureds with an ‘identity crisis’, which they maintain causes 
various social ills within their communities. Embracing Khoisan identity is 
put forward as the only remedy to this felt identity crisis. Correspondingly, as 
Burgess’ heartfelt description attests to, discovering one’s ‘true’ Khoisan iden­
tity is often described as a spiritual/​religious, eye-​opening and life-​changing 
experience, and Khoisan revivalists strive to ‘conscientize’ as many potential 
followers as possible. What is prioritized in these engagements with the past 
is establishing historical continuity between the Khoisan past and personal 
histories and (collective) experiences of being known as Coloured. These 
experiences pertain not only to past and present perceptions of Coloured 
identity as an empty shell devoid of indigeneity and marked by connotations 
of miscegenation and assimilation but also to a felt sense of socioeconomic 
and political marginalization in the post-​apartheid era by virtue of having 
this racial classification. Articulations of Khoisan indigeneity are inescapably 
tied to Coloured identity: their indigeneity is articulated in response to it, and 
their history is reclaimed in light of it. Through these emic histories, which 
take a wide variety of forms, ranging from writing history books and curating 
museums, to staging theatre performances and organizing guided tours, events 
and figures from the past become relatable as their meaning for the present is 
fronted. Contemporary issues affecting their communities such as organized 
crime, substance abuse, domestic violence, or unemployment are placed on 
a historical continuum with the trials and tribulations of the Khoisan. I illus­
trated this at some length by taking the 17th century Khoisan woman Krotoa 
as a case study, but also by scrutinizing various recurrent themes, such as an 
emphasis on being ‘the first freedom fighters’ and ‘the victims of the longest 
colonial history’.
In Chapter 5, I shifted my focus to entitlement claims and the boundaries 
of Khoisan identity. I took these two topics together as Khoisan identity is 
most contested in relation to entitlement claims. Khoisan revivalism is char­
acterized by a great degree of inclusivity in other settings. The vast majority 
of Khoisan revivalists distance themselves from Black identity because they 
believe it has taken on exclusive connotations in the South African context as 
the only valid marker of African heritage. Indeed, in claiming Khoisan identity, 
these Khoisan revivalists deepen their African roots; they do not pursue an 
anti-​Black, anti-​African, or racist agenda. Many also do not purport to be the 
only ones who are ‘indigenous’ to South Africa –​ laying bare a host of emic

definitions (see below). Moreover, rather than staking their claims on notions 
of ‘purity’, phenotype, or descent, Khoisan revivalists readily acknowledge that 
their identity is just as ‘constructed’ as any other. Nevertheless, they retain that 
their historical and contemporary predicaments can only truly be addressed 
by first recognizing that they are ‘indigenous’, ‘eerste nasie’ [first nation], or 
‘first indigenous’, to name the most common labels. This take on indigeneity 
is not endorsed by all Khoisan revivalists, particularly among those invested 
in entitlement claims. Indigeneity is leveraged in these settings to resist what 
Khoisan revivalists regard as their discrimination by an anc agenda that is 
solely invested in the advancement of Blacks, for instance by privileging them 
in the context of affirmative action policies or social housing schemes.
Khoisan revivalists also claim land and traditional leadership titles, although 
both have to do with more than property and power respectively. Some Khoisan 
revivalists couch their indigeneity in terms of prior occupancy, noting that they 
were ‘first’ in (parts of) South Africa. Save for a few secessionists on the fringes, 
hardly anyone advocates that non-​Khoisan vacate the country. More common 
is the position that the Khoisan should be first in line to receive land or reap the 
benefits of owning property because of their distinct past and present predic­
aments. Khoisan revivalists tend to claim land ‘discursively’, linking both their 
material and immaterial concerns through generalized claims, for instance 
through blanket statements such as ‘South Africa belongs to the Khoisan’ or 
likening rock art to title deeds. This does not render these claims any less ‘mate­
rially’ significant; nor do I discount specific claims for historical territory or her­
itage sites, but these are a minority. With regards to traditional leadership, while 
many reject the institution, let alone as defined in the tkla, some believe there 
is a time and place for it. Most point to ceremonial functions, and some feel 
the state should recognize them as ‘chiefs’; the most common term denoting 
traditional leadership positions in Khoisan revivalist circles. It is in this setting 
that attempts to demarcate Khoisan identity are most fierce. There are regu­
lar charges of opportunism, of not possessing the right descent, or of not hav­
ing done enough to advance Khoisan revivalism or uplift the community one 
claims to represent. In the main, however, traditional leadership titles are used 
as a form of in-​group recognition, an open-​ended appellation to show respect, 
rather than a claim to an exclusive position. Having said that, the competition 
over (traditional) leadership positions is the biggest cause for both recurrent 
pleas for unity and for such efforts to falter. People have a tendency to become 
suspicious of each other’s motives, financial support, and ability to negotiate 
with government officials. While the tkla might regulate Khoisan traditional 
leadership to a certain extent, the institution continues to be remoulded to best 
suit Khoisan revivalists’ needs.

Conclusion
Indeed, part of the debate over traditional leadership relates to the degree 
‘continuity’ and ‘change’ with the past is tolerated. I worked with these cate­
gories through an emic lens in Chapter 6, where I shifted the emphasis away 
from what Khoisan revivalists say to what they do. Looking at Khoisan reviv­
alism in practice, I discerned two main kinds of activities: those that seek to 
emulate the past as it is believed to have been at a certain point in time, and 
those that strive to revive Khoisan culture via the explicit introduction of novel 
elements, all the while acknowledging that this distinction is primarily analyt­
ical as Khoisan revivalism in practice always adapts and therefore inescapably 
combines ‘continuity’ and ‘change’. With regards to efforts that emphasize con­
tinuity, there is a recurrent emphasis on finding inspiration ‘North’, that is, in 
the Northern Cape and the ways of life of the San. One of the things Khoisan 
revivalists revive in this fashion are what are considered to be timeworn tra­
ditions, chiefly the !Nau. Other examples include traditional ways of using 
plants and playing musical instruments, as well as wearing traditional attire 
and learning the Khoekhoegowab language. Concerning acts of Khoisan reviv­
alism that explicitly introduce innovation and change, I scrutinized efforts to 
revive Khoisan culture through hip hop, jazz, fashion, or everyday activities 
such as speaking Afrikaans or making art. Crucially, both ‘kinds’ of Khoisan 
revivalism are equally potent, and one does not seem decisively more popular 
than the other.
In Chapter 7, the sole chapter of Part 3, ‘Theoretical perspectives on Khoisan 
revivalism’, I reflected on my empirical data and central research question (‘why 
and how do Khoisan revivalists engage with the past?’) from a theoretical van­
tage point. Due to the recurrent emphasis on ‘healing’ in Khoisan revivalism –​ 
once again well-​illustrated by the opening quote from Burgess –​ I decided to 
focus on the ascribed ‘therapeutic’ qualities of Khoisan revivalism and on how 
these reflect their views on what constitutes an ‘authentic’ engagement with 
the Khoisan past. I more specifically engaged with Ronald Niezen’s concept 
‘therapeutic history’ (2009), and to a lesser extent David Lowenthal’s ideas con­
cerning ‘heritage’ (1998; 2015). The aim of therapeutic history is to counteract 
histories of dispossession and assimilation by cultivating a form of emic his­
tory that generates and prioritizes ‘wellness’ (i.e. in the case of Khoisan reviv­
alism, historical continuity, and relatability). The past needs to serve present 
needs first and foremost, thereby emphasizing histories of dispossession and 
loss, on the one hand, and inspirational episodes from precolonial times and 
anti-​colonial resistance campaigns, on the other. What counts as ‘useful’ his­
torical knowledge in this regard is primarily the result of a process of in-​group 
validation. This is a departure from the emphasis on source-​criticism, dispas­
sionate analysis, and objectivity in what can be described as (conventional)

‘academic history’ –​ all the while acknowledging this is an analytical distinc­
tion more than anything else, least of all a hierarchical one. This framework 
helps to understand why many Khoisan revivalists tend to romanticize the 
past, place ‘Coloured experience’ at the centre of their historical understand­
ing, single out certain episodes from the past, utilize anachronisms, and prop­
agate their interpretations of the past across various mediums and channels. 
Crucially, there are certainly Khoisan revivalists, particularly those with uni­
versity degrees, who do not seemingly engage with the past in a ‘therapeutic’ 
format. However, I would argue that, these being in a minority, they constitute 
the exception that proves the rule. Moreover, as they too are driven first and 
foremost by revivalist ambitions, their emic histories are not entirely free from 
‘therapeutic’ characteristics either.
Khoisan revivalists pursue a specific kind of ‘authenticity’ when seeking 
the therapeutics of emic histories. Borrowing definitions from Laura Saxton 
(2020), I drew a useful distinction in this regard between ‘authenticity’ as 
the subjective interpretation of the essence of the past and ‘accuracy’ as that 
which is in line with established facts. Accuracy and authenticity are related 
but do not define one another. Key to producing authenticity is ‘verisimilitude’, 
or the subjective approximation of what is considered original or accurate. 
I argued that what Khoisan revivalism produces is ‘subversive authenticity’: an 
agential authenticity that is based on a verisimilitude that is not bound by 
notions of accuracy, nor the rejection or reification of colonialist representa­
tions of the Khoisan, which I critically surveyed with the help of Patrick Wolfe’s 
(1999) concept ‘repressive authenticity’. What is being subverted by Khoisan 
revivalists is in many cases the notion of repressive authenticity itself: they 
do not just ‘counter’ it –​ thereby still ‘responding’ to it and letting it domi­
nate their authenticity –​ many cultivate an authenticity where what could be 
considered repressive in a certain context is paradoxically appropriated, rei­
fied, or disregarded depending on what best suits present needs. The result 
is not the antithesis of the Khoisan extinction discourse per se, although its 
central premise of extinction is certainly debunked, and its imposed bound­
aries of what constitutes Khoisan authenticity are manifestly eroded. Rather, 
the outcome of Khoisan revivalism is a plurality of articulations of indigene­
ity that assist Khoisan revivalists in pursuing the ends of therapeutic history 
without being fixated on whether their identities are ‘accurate’ or sufficiently 
anti-​colonial.
To me, the concepts ‘subversive authenticity’ and ‘therapeutic history’ 
address the analytical limits of strategic essentialism and what I described as 
‘instrumentalism’ in the Introduction, and thereby embody a kind of meta-​cri­
tique academics should take on board when studying contexts of indigenous

Conclusion
revivalism. ‘The Khoisan revivalist guide to reclaiming history and authentic­
ity’, as I referred to it, is a useful case-​study to think through how indigenous 
identity is shaped and perceived in a 21st century world with an increasingly 
urban and cosmopolitan outlook. It can be a useful analytical lens for what 
Maximillian Forte (2013, 15) called ‘resurgent ethnography’, a type of ethnog­
raphy that directly seeks to counter the legacies of the ‘salvage ethnography’ 
of the 19th and 20th centuries by emphasizing the dynamism and complexity 
inherent in instances of indigenous revivalism. By looking at articulations of 
indigeneity, my research has certainly added a layer of dynamism and com­
plexity to the case of Khoisan revivalism. The importance of the historical and 
contemporary experience of being known as ‘Coloured’ does not invalidate 
their claims to indigeneity, but it does render their articulations of indige­
neity more complex than the binary indigenous/​non-​indigenous. The central 
role of (Coloured/​Khoisan) experience also poses various conundrums with 
regards to Khoisan revivalism’s intellectual and sociopolitical accommoda­
tion, particularly in relation to entitlement claims. In drawing on a dialectic 
interpretation of (anti-​) colonialism by Frantz Fanon, I concluded Chapter 7 
by considering whether Khoisan revivalism is undergoing a phase where it 
still has to shed its colonial baggage and assert itself in society, thereby neces­
sitating a process of therapeutic history. Others might see Khoisan revival­
ism as a temporary phenomenon, a fleeting incarnation of identity politics. 
Indeed, as I elaborate below, a lot depends on one’s views regarding the role 
of ethnicity in everyday life and politics.
Khoisan revivalists will stake their claim in South African society for years 
to come. As Khoisan revivalism expands in new directions, it will benefit 
from being scrutinized from various corners. Revisiting the limitations of 
my research, some suggestions come to mind. My open-​ended definition of 
Khoisan revivalism led me to survey a wide range of people and events at the 
expense of in-​depth case studies. It would be worthwhile for another researcher, 
preferably someone with more access, to focus on the day-​to-​day activities of 
a number of Khoisan revivalists or to canvass the support for Khoisan reviv­
alism in a specific locale. On that note, I was biased towards leading Khoisan 
revivalists at the expense of those who do not feature as prominently. Similarly, 
there is little data on what average South Africans think about Khoisan reviv­
alism. While Khoisan revivalism is most vibrant in Cape Town, it is apparent 
elsewhere in South Africa (see e.g. Erasmus 2012). During fieldwork but espe­
cially in editions of enn or on social media, I came across Khoisan revivalists 
in the Johannesburg/​Pretoria area in particular. As no research exists about 
these groups to date, I wonder how their articulations of indigeneity might 
differ or overlap with those I discerned in Cape Town. Conversely, it would

be interesting to examine how communities where Khoisan identity is more 
established relate to Khoisan revivalism. San communities across Southern 
Africa are an obvious option but also mission stations in the Western and 
Northern Cape (see e.g. De Jongh 2012). Other thematic approaches could also 
be taken in future research, such as Khoisan revivalist spirituality or epistemol­
ogy; topics I barely addressed. It is also important to appreciate that Khoisan 
revivalism does not operate in a political vacuum. Various groups are recon­
figuring their identities in post-​apartheid South Africa and one wonders how 
these compare with or relate to Khoisan revivalists (see e.g. Carton, Laband 
and Sithole 2008; McNeill 2016). This is by no means an exhaustive list, but 
I want to add one more suggestion for further research, which merits a sepa­
rate section as I believe it is of particular importance.

Indigeneity, Prior Occupancy, and Belonging: A Political Conflation
As Khoisan revivalism is only set to become more widespread, it is vital to 
understand how it navigates the wider South African political landscape. 
Recent developments regarding land reform I revisit shortly have made this 
an urgent topic. As I will show, Khoisan revivalism has interacted with politi­
cians and political parties since its inception. However, Zenzile Khoisan (24/​
05/​2018) discerned an increased interest since the general elections of May 
2014 in particular, when ‘every constituency started looking on how best to 
interact with [Khoisan revivalism] and hitch their wagon to it’. As a politician 
from the Freedom Front Plus (see below) remarked in enn in 2014, establish­
ing alliances with political parties not only helps to address their grievances, 
it also gives them access to financial resources, administrative infrastructure, 
and a vast network of constituents (enn 2014d, 13). The more established polit­
ical parties might also be able to support those created by the Khoisan them­
selves. More research is needed to ascertain how Khoisan political parties are 
funded, what their support-​base is, and on which platforms they run. However, 
for now they have been short-​lived and unsuccessful at the ballot box, with 
the possible exception of Khoisan Revolution (see Chapter 3). Various polit­
ical actors have placed advertisements and opinion pieces in enn seeking to 
rally votes among Khoisan revivalists, particularly in the lead up to the 2014 
elections (see e.g. enn 2013a, 5, 7). The conservative right-​wing party Freedom 
Front Plus (ff+​) and the extreme-​left Africanist party Economic Freedom 
Fighters (eff), both of which I say more about below, pledged to support 
Khoisan revivalism if elected (enn 2014a, 1). Political advertisement in enn 
declined after the elections, but politicians have kept engaging with Khoisan

Conclusion
revivalism, and it is worth elaborating on some of the main actors and their 
motives. Others are likely to be relevant here; this is but a brief reflection on 
scattered data I have gathered along the way. I also did not pool my interloc­
utors’ political preferences directly: both subjects require further research to 
properly address. However, based on informal conversations and observations, 
I did not discern clear voting patterns. The following should be read bearing 
these caveats in mind.
As the sole party in charge on the national level since the end of apartheid, 
I have already given a lot of insight into how the anc relates to Khoisan reviv­
alism, but I have mostly focused on policy development rather than ideology 
or concrete electoral campaigns. On the one hand, the anc clearly emphasizes 
that the Khoisan are equal citizens and ‘Africans’. The party’s then Secretary 
General put it bluntly in 2013: ‘the Khoisan should not ‘think like a minority, 
because [they] are part of a majority’ (enn 2013f, 7). If they would vote as the 
majority, the anc would defeat the main opposition party, the Democratic 
Alliance (da), and take control of the Western Cape, which they have only 
managed for a brief period of time in the mid-​2000s.1 Votes for the anc have 
dwindled among Coloureds for decades (Justesen and Schulz-​Herzenberg 
2018; Paret 2018). One could see the appeasement of Khoisan revivalists by 
people such as Marius Fransman, who was chairman of the Western Cape anc 
between 2011 and 2016, as a strategy to increase its votes among Coloureds. 
Fransman underwent a !Nau (see Chapter 6) and has repeatedly made pro-​
Khoisan revivalist statements in public, such as accusing the da of perpetu­
ating ‘cultural genocide’ by refusing to recognize the Khoisan as the ‘original 
owners’ of the land, or pledging his full support to ‘reclaiming our ancestral 
land’ (enn 2014d, 6; enn 2014f, 1; enn 2016a, 6). At the funeral of the prom­
inent Khoisan revivalist Richard Kutela in 2016, he also referenced the defeat 
of D’Almeida in 1510 by asking those in attendance if they were ‘ready to take 
up the spears of the warriors of the 1500s and do justice to their legacy’ and 
unite to reclaim the land (enn 2016a, 6; see also Robins 1997, 37; see Figure 11). 
I return to the implications of this appeasement in light of the anc’s commit­
ment to non-​racialism below.
	1	 I reiterate that I cannot draw any profound conclusions from this, but the Democratic 
Alliance (da), the main opposition party in South Africa, which also heads the Western Cape, 
was largely absent during my fieldwork. The only reference I have relates to the Khoisan 
Kingdom, who reported in enn (2014k, 5) that they held a meeting with da representatives 
in 2014, who recognized their identity as Khoisan and the fact that more needed to be done 
to celebrate their history.

In terms of political engagements by the opposition, one demographic 
stands out, which I will broadly refer to as ‘Afrikaner interest groups’ as they 
are primarily intent on safeguarding and advancing the rights of the Afrikaner 
minority. Such groups have interacted with Khoisan revivalism since the begin­
ning and with the Griqua even before that. Michael Besten (2006, 279–​282) 
and Linda Waldman (2007b, 48) describe some of the earliest ties between 
Griqua groupings and the Freedom Front (ff, the predecessor of the ff+​) in 
the 1990s. Some of the individuals involved played key roles in Khoisan revival­
ism later on, such as Daniel Kanyiles, who joined Joseph Little in setting up the 
National Council of Khoi Chiefs (Brink 2003, 16; see Chapter 3). Peter Marais 
was also a member of Kanyiles’ Griekwa Volksparty until the 1990s, when he 
joined the National Party (Brink 2003, 7). As I noted in Chapter 4, Marais was 
mayor of Cape Town and Premier of the Western Cape in the early 2000s and 
is the Western Cape representative for the ff+​ at the time of writing. His name

Conclusion
carries weight, and it is therefore significant that he has begun to engage with 
Khoisan revivalism as well, for instance in the context of Krotoa International 
Airport (see Chapter 4). Marais strives for greater autonomy for the Western 
Cape in order to, among other things, recognize the Khoisan as indigenous 
people (see Meyer 2014a; 2014b); but more research is necessary to scrutinize 
how Marais’ politics interacts with Khoisan revivalism (see e.g. Jacobs and 
Levenson 2018).
The fact that Marais has made the ff+​ his political home provides some 
clues, however. The ff not only approached the Griqua in the 1990s but also 
campaigned among a contingent of Khoisan soldiers who fought on the side 
of the apartheid regime in Namibia, but were relocated to temporary hous­
ing in Schmidtsdrift in the Northern Cape after the country gained indepen­
dence in 1990 (Douglas 1997, 47; see Chapter 2). During a campaign rally in the 
area in 1994, the ff emphasized what they saw as the shared political plight 
of Afrikaners and Khoisan in the new South Africa, that is, the need for a volk­
staat, ‘a formalised locale, a politically legitimated spatial locus of cultural and 
ethnic exclusivity’ (Douglas 1995, 66–​67). As a separate nation state became 
increasingly unlikely to materialize and unpopular among its support base, 
various Afrikaner collectives have begun to rebrand themselves as ‘minori­
ties’ (Alsheh and Elliker 2015). The emphasis on a shared fate as ‘discriminated 
minorities’ looking for self-​determination became the main argument for rap­
prochement with the Khoisan ever since (cf. Bam 2014, 126; see also Muthien 
and Khosa 1995, Figure 12). The ff+​ has not only approached the Khoisan but 
indigenous people elsewhere to bolster its case for self-​determination along 
these lines (Furlong 2012, 60).2 With regards to the Khoisan, the party has 
openly sympathized with King Cornelius’ ambitions for self-​determination 
and secession (Besent 2018; see Chapter 5), recognized the Khoisan as indig­
enous people (enn 2013a, 7; 2013b, 7), supported publications such as enn 
(2014c, 2) and provided other means of financial support to Khoisan revival­
ists. Other Afrikaner interest groups such as Afriforum, the civil society outfit 
of the labour union Solidariteit [Solidarity], which considers itself ‘a key extra-​
parliamentary counterweight to the ruling anc’ (Van Zyl-​Hermann 2018), 
have also expressed their support for recognizing the Khoisan as indigenous 
people, have drawn parallels between their campaigns for greater protection 
	2	 A number of Afrikaner collectives pleaded with the United Nations on several occasions for 
recognition as indigenous people, but their requests were denied as Afrikaners were judged 
not have a historical and present-​day experience of marginalization and discrimination 
(Oomen 2005, 10). For more on Afrikaner claims to indigeneity, in relation to the Khoisan or 
otherwise, see Douglas 1995; Pillay 2004; Koot 2015.

of Afrikaans and those of the Khoisan for Khoekhoegowab, and have argued 
that their history too has ‘been tarnished and their importance in the country’s 
history glossed over’ (enn 2013a, 5; 2013f, 11; Nicolson 2012; see also Furlong 
2012, 58).
A final major political actor that needs to be mentioned is the aforemen­
tioned eff, founded in 2013 by former members of the anc Youth League and 
widely regarded as responsible for pushing the anc to embrace a policy of 
land expropriation without compensation (Paret 2018, 473). In fact, the eff 
profiles itself mainly on expedited land reform, arguing that the persistence 
of socioeconomic inequalities along racial lines is primarily due to the unjust 
distribution of land ownership, resulting in a majority of landless Blacks and 
a minority of property-​owning Whites. It is unclear where the Khoisan fea­
ture in this dichotomy, although the eff President and Commander-​in-​Chief, 
Julius Malema, once replied to a Khoisan revivalist, who argued that he had 
no ‘authority’ to speak about land matters ‘since the Khoisan were there first’, 
that she failed to recognize that they were all Africans first and foremost.3 
However, Malema has since not only called for recognizing Khoekhoegowab

Conclusion
as an official language and giving the Khoisan statutory recognition but has 
also acknowledged that everyone in South Africa is historically-​speaking an 
immigrant except for the Khoisan (enn 2014c, 2; Keppler 2018; see also Bam 
2014, 127). Malema elaborated on this interpretation of history at a meeting 
that was called by the Khoisan Kingdom in Capricorn, Cape Town, in January 
2014.4 On this occasion he not only described the Khoisan as the ‘most mar­
ginalized Africans on the continent’, he also recognized them as indigenous 
people, ‘the rightful owners of the land’ and thanked them for ‘welcoming’ the 
‘African majority’ that came from ‘the North’ into ‘their country’ at an unspec­
ified time in the past.
Before reflecting on how these interactions and endorsements relate to 
South Africa’s current political climate and recent policy developments, I reit­
erate that additional research is required to ascertain whether my hypotheses 
have merit. Having said that, I read in these political engagements a particular 
conflation of indigeneity, prior occupancy, and belonging set against the anc’s 
endorsement of land expropriation without compensation in February 2018. 
With ‘belonging’, I refer to ‘a sense of connection […] familiarity, comfort and 
ease […] feelings of inclusion, acceptance and safety’ (Koot, Hitchcock and 
Gressier 2019, 347). Belonging is a ‘relational concept’ and someone can be des­
ignated as not belonging as well (ibid., 349). As various political actors position 
themselves in anticipation of land expropriation without compensation, the 
notion of belonging gains greater significance: if land is transferred away from 
Whites, does that imply that they do not ‘belong’ or that Blacks belong more? 
As Stasja Koot, Robert Hitchcock, and Catie Gressier recently put it: ‘[A]‌gainst 
the background of […] increasing inequalities, the question of who the land 
belongs to –​ and, equally important, who belongs to the land –​ is more relevant 
than ever’ (ibid., 342). So too are connotations of prior occupancy attached 
to indigeneity as these emerge as potentially powerful forms of leverage: if 
only the Khoisan can claim prior occupancy, are they not the first victims of 
colonial ‘land expropriation and compensation’ and therefore most entitled to 
compensation? These issues have always been part of South African politics, 
but they seem to crystalize around the land debate in recent years, boosting 
the political traction of Khoisan revivalism in the process.5 As Thembela Kepe 
	4	 I thank Rudolf Rieger for sharing an audio-​recording of this meeting.
	5	 It is important to emphasize that while historical justice has always been part of South Africa’s 
land reform program, present-​day economic arguments have taken precedence (Kepe and 
Hall 2018). Indeed, there are of course various ways of claiming land, belonging, and even 
indigeneity in this context, but these fall outside the scope of this book (see Veracini and 
Verbuyst 2020).

and Ruth Hall (2018, 134) put it, now more than ever are there two ‘competing 
narratives’ regarding land: land as a resource to be put to optimal economic 
use, on the one hand, and land as related to historical injustices and ‘argu­
ments of indigeneity’ but also ‘identity, home, family, heritage, livelihood and 
many other meanings’, on the other.
While it is unlikely that these concerns will displace the predominant eco­
nomic incentives that dictate land reform policy in South Africa, it is notewor­
thy how they are turned into political capital by the various political players 
I mentioned earlier. I do not want to speculate too widely on what motivates 
them. Nor do I regard their views as representative of the constituencies and 
demographic they (aim to) represent. All the while, one cannot help but notice 
that Afrikaners and Khoisan are strange bedfellows in light of the role of the 
former in the colonization of the latter. Then again, as they both feel threat­
ened by what they regard as the anc’s ‘Africanist agenda’, mutual efforts to 
establish alliances are not as surprising as they might seem at first glance 
(Steyn 2016, 485, 499; see below). There is more at play here than ‘the enemy 
of my enemy is my friend’; the political geometry involved in recognizing the 
Khoisan as the only indigenous people in South Africa places everyone else 
on an ‘equal’ footing as ‘settlers’, including the Bantu-​speaking majority (see 
also Veracini and Verbuyst 2020). Positioning the Khoisan in this way is remi­
niscent of the way apartheid officials envisaged Coloureds as a buffer between 
Whites and Blacks (see Chapter 2). This broad-​brush reading of the past has 
been used to deflate the latter’s claims to the land. The previous leader of the 
ff+​ for instance claimed in 2012 that Bantu-​speaking groups were ‘foreign to 
40 percent of South Africa […] Technically, no one can lay claim to land in 
SA. We have got a complicated system. Nobody can say this is my total land 
[…] When whites arrived [in the Western Cape], there were Khoi people, not 
blacks’ (Piet Mulder cited in Mboti 2013, 459). Moreover, the ceo of Afriforum 
emphasized in 2018 that ‘it was important to recognise that black people were 
also responsible for the dispossession of the Khoi and the San’ (Hlatshaneni 
2018). In this perspective, the Bantu-​speaking majority are colonial ‘immi­
grants’ just like Whites.
Naturally, the eff refutes this interpretation, even if they do occasionally 
endorse the Khoisan’s prior occupancy, though not resulting in any changes 
to official party policy. Yet they stand little to lose in this quasi-​endorsement 
as it does not alter their position that ‘Africans’ in general should be first in 
line to benefit from expedited land reform. Indeed, there is a subtle, yet highly 
relevant, clue contained in the way Malema framed the historical encounter 
between the Khoisan and the Bantu-​speaking groups who migrated to South 
Africa roughly 1800 years ago (although he did not specify a date). Malema

Conclusion
stressed how the Bantu were ‘welcomed’ by the Khoisan; he does not couch 
their meeting as one of colonialism, a term he reserves for the interactions 
between ‘Africans’ and Europeans. According to Malema as well as the anc, at 
the end of the day, what matters most is that the Khoisan were on the receiving 
end of European colonialism just like other Africans. While this onslaught was 
felt by Khoisan and non-​Khoisan alike, I have shown how it impacted them in 
different ways as well. Underplaying these differences has been described by 
Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang (2012, 17) as ‘colonial equivocation’ or the homo­
genisation of ‘various experiences of oppression as colonization’. I showed 
in Chapter 3 how colonial equivocation informs the South African govern­
ment’s unofficial position that there is no merit in designating the Khoisan 
as indigenous people. Indeed, as I noted, it prefers to frame them as ‘Africans’, 
‘vulnerable indigenous people’, or as one indigenous people among many. In 
this process, specific predicaments faced by Khoisan (revivalists) did not get 
addressed or meaningfully acknowledged, principally in the unique ways in 
which they are affected by legacies of dispossession and assimilation (see also 
Crawhall 1999, 324; Lehmann 2004, 110; Veracini and Verbuyst 2020). What is 
offered instead through legislation such as the tkla is assimilation: not as the 
sole indigenous people but as ‘Africans’ (even if, under the tkla, as Khoisan).
To understand where all this politicking around indigeneity, prior occu­
pancy, and belonging leaves Khoisan revivalists and their land claims, I want to 
elaborate next on why I believe it is productive to think through Khoisan reviv­
alism’s societal repercussions and potential political accommodation through 
the frame of ‘Khoisan Consciousness’.

Khoisan Consciousness and Its Discontents
What I referred to as ‘colonial equivocation’ can be motivated by noble inten­
tions. Had South Africa’s reconciliation ethos not emphasized rallying points 
over difference, the transition of power likely would not have been as peaceful. 
And yet, as Adam Habib and Kristina Bentley (2008, 337) observe, ever since, 
the main challenge of ‘South Africa’s democratic experiment’ has been ‘how 
to advance redress in order to address the historical injustices while simulta­
neously building a single national cosmopolitan identity’. Many have put for­
ward suggestions in this regard, and I do not have the space to do justice to 
them all here. Let me single out a few to highlight some of the main arguments. 
Habib and Bentley suggest no longer linking redress to ‘race’, but to ‘class’ 
(which overlaps with ‘race’ in practice), as this is the only way to avoid ‘for­
ever holding South Africa hostage to a polarised politics of fractiousness and

ethnic mobilisation’ (ibid., 337, 346). Mahmood Mamdani (2001, 661) also pro­
poses to flatten differences by focussing on ‘common residence over common 
descent –​ indigeneity –​ as the basis of rights’. Ciraj Rassool (2019, 343) offers a 
similar pathway, arguing that South African history is a ‘deep, historical con­
test’ between societies that organize around race and ethnicity, and those 
that seek to do without them. Rassool (ibid., 344) sides with the latter camp 
of ‘non-​racialism’, which he argues is not ‘merely a politics of racial equality’ 
or ‘a facile, opportunistic politics of colorblindness’ but a ‘politics of race that 
calls attention to histories of how races and racial systems were made in legis­
lative, social, and epistemic terms’. On this ‘long-​term epistemological project 
of making new society and new persons […] outside the racial terms and cate­
gories of colonialism and apartheid’ the main challenge, according to Rassool, 
is debunking notions of ‘race’ and ‘ethnicity’ as ‘natural and innate’ (ibid., 343, 
345, 366). This is an urgent mission, he underscores, as ‘[t]‌wenty-​five years after 
the end of apartheid, these race categories have gone on to have new life, with 
race-​based claims framed around the distinction between indigeneity and set­
tler foreignness, the need for land expropriation to reverse long histories of 
racialized land dispossession, and with attention also drawn to alleged racial 
hierarchies of suffering under apartheid’ (ibid., 346).
As I noted in Chapter 7, Rassool sees certain strands of Khoisan revivalism as 
examples of this trend. Like Habib and Bentley, who suggest that class should 
replace other parameters, or Mamdani, who believes the politics of ethnicity 
are a dead-​end, Rassool holds that ethnicity should not have any political sway. 
Their critique of the mobilization of ethnicity as ‘natural and innate’ is com­
mendable, but it does not capture how most Khoisan revivalists relate to their 
identities or consider them political assets. I also wonder where their frame­
work leaves other, perhaps more important, ways in which people relate to 
ethnicity or indigeneity in their everyday lives. As I noted in the Introduction, 
an instrumentalist reading of ethnicity is not the only valid approach when 
studying the subject. In the work of scholars like Rassool, indigeneity is fre­
quently conflated with prior occupancy and belonging along the lines I set out 
above. From this perspective, any kind of embrace of ethnicity risks ‘reviving 
the dead-​weight legacy of apartheid ascriptions’ (Dubow 1994, 368) or fuel­
ling xenophobic sentiments (Solomon 2019). Once more, I am not arguing that 
there is no merit to their criticisms or that some Khoisan revivalist articula­
tions of indigeneity are not evidence of what they warn about. As I noted in 
Chapter 5, entitlement claims in particular have a tendency to aggravate exclu­
sionary tendencies. There has, however, also been significant pushback against 
this kind of take on ethnicity, most of which I covered in the Introduction. 
Related to South African nationalism more specifically, various studies have

Conclusion
pointed out how, for most citizens (including Khoisan revivalists), ethnicity 
does not negate their national identity; multiple identities can co-​coexist (see 
e.g. Comaroff and Comaroff 2009, 50; Brown 2001, 766). Duncan Brown saw 
possibilities in a ‘recuperated or revindicated nationalism’ along these lines, 
‘based not on the fiction of imagined unity [or ethnic purity], but on a shared 
problematic: a mutual implication in a history of difference’ (Brown 2001, 
757). Crucially, for Brown, this meant holding onto labels such as ‘African’ or 
‘Afrikaner’ but also assigning them new meanings, particularly stressing their 
historical ‘mutual involvement’ (Brown 2001, 767). In other words, Brown 
emphasized that ethnicity does not necessarily need to be conflictual and any 
attempt to negate ethnicity might backfire.
Looking at South African society in recent years, Brown turned out to be 
correct in his prediction that the rhetoric of nation-​building and reconcilia­
tion would eventually run into its limits, at least according to various disgrun­
tled stakeholders in South African society. Indeed, some have argued in recent 
years that the period of transition to democracy has concluded; ‘multiracial­
ism, constitutionalism, and reconciliation’ are now increasingly seen as part of 
the ‘post-​apartheid mirage’ (Hodes 2017, 149). ‘Post-​transitional’ South Africa 
is not marked by an emphasis on reconciliation but by appeals to socioeco­
nomic transformation and redress –​ both considered long overdue –​ as well as 
a reoriented politics of history, ‘a new kind of (commemorative) public culture’ 
that not only scrutinizes the legacies of apartheid but just as much those of 
the preceding colonial history (Holmes and Loehwing 2016, 15–​17; Hayem 2017, 
394). Rebecca Hodes (2017, 149) has argued that this emphasis, as embodied in 
movements such as Rhodes Must Fall, is ‘to reveal the persistence of the past 
in the present […] Through actions involving statues, paintings, and buildings, 
the artefacts and edifices of memorialization, protestors refute the protective 
estrangement of the past, rendering its symbols live, present, and productive’. 
While Khoisan revivalism was initiated during the ‘transitional period’, it is 
undeniably the case that it gained more traction as a result of the rise of such 
sentiments across the board. Ethnicity or race have not slowly disappeared as 
meaningful social labels since 1994, but, as Rassool also pointed out, they seem 
to have become more prominent. This includes the anc, were many, including 
notable members such as ex-​President Thabo Mbeki, have discerned a growing 
caucus that abandons ‘non-​racialism’ in favour of ‘Africanist traditional values’ 
and ‘populist Black republicanism’ (Ndlovu-​Gatsheni 2009, 65; Beresford 2015, 
228).6 As I noted, it is unclear where Coloured identity fits within this strategy,

Conclusion
335
although the majority of Khoisan revivalists I interacted with regard this as 
something to their exclusion and further discrimination.
In order to understand how Khoisan revivalism relates to these sociopolit­
ical developments, the abovementioned commentary of critics needs to be 
complemented with the type of understanding of ‘ethnicity’ I have tried to 
cultivate in this text. As I announced earlier, I believe it is opportune to do 
so by thinking through Khoisan revivalism’s relationship with indigeneity and 
ethnicity through the notion of ‘Khoisan Consciousness’. I put this forward, 
not as an elaborated concept, but as more of a hypothesis intent on provoking 
further research.
As I signalled early on, I speak in part of Khoisan Consciousness to highlight 
the overlap between Khoisan revivalism and Steve Biko’s Black Consciousness 
philosophy, which pleaded for a Black political identity, not on the basis of 
skin colour but as a result of being on the receiving end of a racist political 
system and one’s willingness to dismantle it. Any other form of identification, 
including Coloured identity, was dismissed as a form of ‘false consciousness’. 
Biko and his followers instead felt it imperative to instil pride in African roots, 
celebrating noteworthy historical figures and events in the process. Many have 
highlighted how Biko’s ideas retain their relevance in today’s South Africa 
through movements such as Rhodes Must Fall (see e.g. Ntloedibe 2019, 70). 
As others have observed, not only were (and are) many Khoisan revivalists 
adherents of Black Consciousness, many of its core tenets are also reflected in 
Khoisan revivalism at large, most notably the idea of false consciousness and 
the need to take pride in the past (see e.g. Lee 1998, 50; Brown and Deumert 
2017, 574). While ethnicity is shunned in Biko’s philosophy, there are also tell­
ing parallels with the criteria for claiming Khoisan identity (Gibson 2003, 65). 
Similar to the requirements of Black identity set out by Biko, Khoisan iden­
tity is primarily (though not exclusively) related to the experience of being 
known as Coloured and the decision to distance oneself from it. As I noted in 
Chapter 5, the majority of Khoisan revivalists therefore do not consider their 
identities as ‘natural or innate’ or based on race or skin colour but as the result 
of a complex, somewhat contradictory set of factors involving both lineage and 
one’s mind-​set in the present.
Although I have noted the exceptions that prove the rule, indigeneity 
emerges here not so much as a lever to diminish the indigeneity of others, to 
deny their historical or present-​day grievances, or to mask a Coloured identity 
politics based on race or class, but as an inclusive, open-​ended, and mean­
ingful articulation in response to the experience of being known as Coloured, 
with both political and less explicitly political features. Indeed, in the spirit of 
‘Khoisan Consciousness’, people are able to articulate their Khoisan identity

Conclusion
in the terms they find most meaningful: regardless of religion, political creed, 
and to a large extent, their ‘race’ as defined by the South African government. 
I say ‘to a large extent’, because Coloured identity plays a crucial role but not as 
an absolute criterion. A real ‘test’ in this regard would be to gauge the reaction 
of Khoisan revivalists should people who are not classified as Coloured, but 
have ‘Khoisan’ genetic markers (see Chapter 5, Introduction) or Khoisan mem­
bers in their family, also start identifying as Khoisan (see also Besten 2006, 
343). Khoisan revivalists in principle do not oppose such claims, although they 
are sceptical of peoples’ motives in this regard. Then again, the fact that such 
claims have not taken place on a massive scale suggests that those who did 
not undergo the ‘Coloured experience’ find less meaning in Khoisan identity. 
While inescapably linked to the legacy of apartheid-​era ethnicity politics, 
‘Khoisan Consciousness’ is not a mere reincarnation of the ethnic politics of 
old. Just like Black Consciousness was not only about fighting racial segrega­
tion through protests and manifestations but also about making cultural inter­
ventions, so too do Khoisan revivalists’ articulations of indigeneity pertain to 
various spheres of society. Rather than an innate feature, Khoisan revivalism 
suggests a particular ‘mind-​set’ or ‘consciousness’ as reflected in the way its 
adherents conceive of themselves and the world around them. Not coinci­
dentally then, the term ‘consciousness’ is regularly used by Khoisan revival­
ists as well (see e.g. enn 2014e, 12; 2015, 4; Coetzee 2019b, 150). Ultimately, the 
rub lies not with the experiences that Khoisan revivalists place at the core of 
their identities, but with whether these are sufficient grounds for entitlement 
claims, particularly in light of the abovementioned struggle over prior occu­
pancy, land, and belonging.
It falls outside the scope of this book to formulate policy suggestions or other 
ways through which South African society can better accommodate Khoisan 
revivalism given the challenges I just highlighted, but I would be remiss if I did 
not briefly meditate on some suggestions in light of this thought-​experiment 
with ‘Khoisan Consciousness’ (see also Veracini and Verbuyst 2020). A couple 
of caveats first. How Khoisan revivalism should feature in South African soci­
ety is a decision which all South African citizens have to make, not just Khoisan 
revivalists, whom I am likely biased towards, but who are not speaking with 
one voice either. I am probably overemphasizing the degree to which Khoisan 
revivalism plays a role in my interlocutors’ lives –​ not all of the predicaments 
they face are (solely) related to their Khoisan identity (see Chapter 1). Most of 
their day-​to-​day concerns are likely unrelated to Khoisan revivalism and are 
shared with various other groups in South African society, if not the majority. 
Critics of identity politics, not unlike the critics of ethnicity I mentioned pre­
viously, have made such observations to question whether placing ‘identity’

and ‘culture’ as policy outcomes would not create more ‘divisions’ and move 
further away from addressing the underlying grievances (see e.g. Rorty 2000, 
9, 13, 19). As I have argued throughout this book, for Khoisan revivalists their 
socioeconomic grievances are deeply related to their identity. That is not to 
say that policy should therefore solely deal with ‘identity’ or cease focusing 
on apartheid. With its traces painfully present, the dismantling of apartheid 
certainly needs to remain the top priority of South African politics of redress. 
Nothing I say here is to diminish apartheid’s importance, including for Khoisan 
revivalists, who also continue to suffer from its legacies. Once again, however, 
Khoisan revivalists tie the recent (i.e. apartheid) and distant (i.e. colonial) past 
together; they are not considered as fundamentally separate historical epi­
sodes. My point is rather that various policies that are already in place could 
assist the Khoisan (to a greater extent), if they took their emic histories and 
interpretations of indigeneity into greater consideration.
It is important to take into account here that the post-​apartheid dispensation 
inherited the injustices of the colonial and apartheid past. However, according 
to Jana Thompson (2006, 160–​161), this should not serve as an excuse not to 
address them. The state is after all an ‘intergenerational’ entity, which needs to 
be seen as a credible moral actor by its citizens and therefore strive to rectify 
past wrongs. Not doing so undermines trust in the state and stimulates discon­
tent, as is evident not only in Khoisan revivalism but in the various outbursts 
of ‘post-​transitionalism’ more broadly. The vast majority of Khoisan revival­
ists are not irredentists but desire more recognition from the South African 
state, if on their own terms. They do not wish to get rid of their South African 
citizenship but to make it more meaningful to them, paradoxically through 
claiming indigeneity. The anc government faces the brunt of their criticism, 
not because they are held responsible for the past but for their perceived lack 
of commitment to redress. It has signed potentially powerful treaties such as 
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, but as a 
non-​binding instrument, this has changed little on the ground. I do not want 
to imply here that all of the government’s positions and policies are cynical or 
intent on keeping the Khoisan and their claims to indigeneity as far at bay as 
possible, but I do want to flag both the counterproductive effects they might 
generate as well as the points about Khoisan revivalism they might miss in the 
process.
It is not unreasonable to celebrate the tkla as the first time the South 
African government officially recognizes the Khoisan within its borders (see 
e.g. Øvernes 2019, vii). The tkla places a foot in the door in that it will register 
the amount of Khoisan traditional leaders and their constituents in the coun­
try, a longstanding demand (see Chapter 3; see also Rowse 2009). Recognition

Conclusion
is only granted to traditional leaders, however, and combined with ambiguous 
communication from the South African government regarding the require­
ments for recognition or the possible accommodation of their land claims, it 
can exacerbate infighting and risks only catering to those most apt at strategic 
essentialism, not the other grievances which drive Khoisan revivalism. Khoisan 
revivalists recognize that the matter is complex. Ruben Richards (2017, 553) for 
instance noted that ‘merely accommodating the Khoisan, culturally, in terms of 
a 12th [official] language and, politically, in terms of a seat within the House of 
Traditional Leaders is the easy part. The psychological and spiritual challenge is 
to repair the ongoing and visible legacy of four centuries of brutalisation’. With 
Edward Cavanagh (2013, 16), I do feel that a first step is recognizing that ‘[t]‌he 
politics of transformation have been noble but deliberately (and strangely) 
short-​sighted: land restitution and other programmes of restorative justice […] 
have addressed present and recent injustice, but they have left foundational 
acts of dispossession, annexation, and subjugation unscrutinised’. The urgent 
need to deal specifically with apartheid also likely prevented taking a longer 
historical reach at the time (see also Cavanagh 2012, 438; Cavanagh 2013, 11).
I would add that Khoisan revivalists do not reject South African historical 
justice policies as much as they feel excluded from them. This is apparent in 
how Khoisan revivalists’ land-​related grievances could be accommodated. 
Echoing the position of several government officials (see Chapter 3), Chizuko 
Sato (2018, 216) has made a compelling case for prioritizing the Khoisan in 
existing land redistribution legislation. This route would not necessarily 
require ‘deep historical and genealogical research to establish the legitimacy 
of historical landownership of some particular land by a particular people who 
also have to be proven to be descendants of the historical owners’. Land redis­
tribution allows the government to select plots of land (of historical signifi­
cance), thereby avoiding potentially overlapping claims or having to displace 
current occupants. It also does not require the unlikely two-​thirds majority 
needed in Parliament to scrap the 1913 cut-​off date or provide the Khoisan with 
a special status as indigenous people. The South African government has to 
take into account all of its constituents, but it is striking that so little has hap­
pened with regards to the Khoisan. A significant gesture in this manner could 
already go a long way in tempering Khoisan revivalists’ belief that the govern­
ment does not take their grievances seriously. It could be an example of the 
‘real economic change’ that is required for a project of redress to be seen as 
credible (Wells 2017, 360). As my hypothesis regarding ‘discursive land claims’ 
suggests, heritage sites have the potential to benefit Khoisan revivalism to a 
great extent (see also Patton 2005, 265; Walker 2008, 232). This context too does 
not require legally designating the Khoisan as indigenous people but perhaps

making more use of the constitutionally enshrined ‘right to culture’, as Karin 
Lehmann (2004, 118) pointed out. Once again, the South African government 
has identified this early on, but the relevant projects remain in the planning 
stages for reasons that are unclear. Here too, a swift intervention could signal 
that the government does not solely seek to memorialize anc figureheads but 
also endorses Khoisan revivalism as a serious political and cultural project. An 
example that comes to mind here is renaming Cape Town International Airport 
after Krotoa, a relatively inexpensive gesture with great symbolic potential.7
This way of dealing with Khoisan grievances would take into account how 
Khoisan revivalists relate to indigeneity, which means not just thinking about 
the political nexus prior occupancy-​belonging I sketched above. The longer 
meaningful policy developments remain absent or the South African govern­
ment insists on ‘colonial equivocation’, the more Khoisan revivalists will lose 
faith and look for assistance elsewhere, including among those that draw on 
the Khoisan past to advance an exclusionary or racialized project. Once again, 
I reiterate that more research is needed to conceptualize proper policy sugges­
tions. What undoubtedly needs to be part of the solution, however, is greater 
involvement on the part of Khoisan revivalists themselves, not just in policy 
negotiations but in the academic knowledge these processes draw on.

‘Listening’ to Khoisan Revivalism
The Khoi and San Centre was officially inaugurated on 21 September 2020 
(Swingler 2020). It is housed at the Centre for African Studies at the University 
of Cape Town and its mission is to ‘foreground erased or marginalised indige­
nous knowledge, rituals, language and “ways of knowing” of the San and Khoi 
clans across the university and its communities’. Khoisan issues are part of 
uct’s ‘Vision 2030’, which seeks to confront its colonial past and transform the 
university into a fully-​fledged African institute of higher learning (see also May 
2018). At the launch of the Centre, the university’s vice-​chancellor, Mamokgethi

Conclusion
Phakeng, announced that a Khoekhoegowab undergraduate program will be 
developed over the next five years and that it will feature as an official language 
of instruction in due course. As I noted in Chapter 3, several universities have 
hosted Khoisan-​focused centres in the past, but these proved short-​lived. No 
comparable institute exists at the time of writing and the lack of involvement 
from Khoisan communities in academic knowledge production concerning 
them remains a major concern (Du Plessis 2014, 745).8 This is precisely what 
makes the uct-​based institute a potential game changer. Not only does it stand 
out for its intellectual ambitions, it also strives to involve local communities in 
a sustained and unprecedented manner. The Centre was mainly designed by 
the current acting director, June Bam-​Hutchison, who held an appointment 
at uct previously, and Tauriq Jenkins, chairperson of the A/​Xarra Restorative 
Justice Forum, a network of Khoisan activists, ‘focused on meaningful transfor­
mation at the university, nationally and globally’ (Swingler 2020). As Phakeng 
remarked during the launch, this ‘transformation’ is not only manifested by 
creating the Centre on ‘San and Khoi land’ but also in recognizing that its tar­
get community of ‘indigenous inhabitants’ live in its direct vicinity. To redress 
‘the painful truth of the deep architecture of our university’, Phakeng further­
more vowed to ‘engage in deep listening as we work in partnership with the 
San and Khoi descendant communities’ in ‘a continual journey of recognition 
and acknowledgement’.
Bam-​Hutchison has written passionately about this type of ‘listening’, and 
I want to close by sharing some of her thoughts on the matter. For her as for 
many others, the dawn of a ‘post-​transitional’ phase is evident: ‘[T]‌he ‘rainbow 
nation’ is in fact a false reality; we relate to each other with silent hostility, 
with a silent mutuality of unresolved and unspoken bitterness and even with 
grief and perhaps fear for what was ‘lost’ in the ambivalence of 1994’ (Bam-​
Hutchison 2016, 7). Bam-​Hutchison (ibid., 12–​13) points to the symbolism of 
the 2015 Rhodes Must Fall protests in this regard and how the Khoisan were not 
as meaningfully included as they could have been, perhaps due to the ‘unre­
solved and burning land question for the indigenous people of the Cape’. The 
protests were directly relevant to Khoisan revivalists as they did not request to 
be heard but compelled it, ‘thereby claiming and creating an ethos of belong­
ing for the ‘minoritized’ and ‘peripherised’’ (ibid., 25). These expressions of dis­
enchantment and anger are a consequence of the fact that ‘the majority of the 
	8	 Robert Gordon noted in 2014 that Sol Plaatjie University in Kimberley in the Northern Cape 
announced it will offer a doctorate in ‘Khoisan studies’, though I have not managed to find 
further information about this program or about Khoisan studies at Sol Plaatjie University in 
general (Gordon 2014, 106).

intergenerational wounded was not “heard” at the [Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission’s] “hearings”’ (ibid., 20). What is necessary, Bam-​Hutchison (ibid., 
13–​14, 18, 25, original emphasis) concludes, is a type of ‘listening’ that does not 
simply give ‘voice’, but does so ‘genuinely’. Listening in this manner not only 
forms the basis for potential solutions, it also promises a rewarding research 
agenda, as precolonial South African history ‘is a matter of widespread active 
public interest and a concern that is only weakly served by scholarly research’ 
(ibid., 13–​14; Hamilton 2018, 96). Through ‘methods, concepts and theories that 
are not trapped in European colonial legacies’, academia can further assist in 
making ‘the long past’ more relevant for the present in the spirit of Khoisan 
revivalism: ‘to make [the past] available as resources to fuel creative thinking 
about the future’ (Hamilton 2018, 96–​97). In this way, and particularly through 
the Khoi and San Centre, Bam-​Hutchison (2016, 13) believes the gap between 
Khoisan revivalism and academia can be bridged and a more productive and 
sustained public debate can flourish. Regardless of the challenges involved in 
producing such a ‘history’ I laid out at the end of Chapter 7, this is a crucial 
step towards taking Khoisan revivalism seriously as a long-​term political and 
intellectual project.
The question of when Khoisan revivalism ‘ceases’ to be a ‘revival’ surfaces 
once again. Which milestones need to be reached before it is no longer sensi­
ble to speak of Khoisan revivalism? When Khoisan identity will be considered 
by South Africans to be just as (un)problematic as any other, when it will be 
possible to indicate ‘Khoisan’ in the census, and when Khoisan land claims 
will be officially recognized are all criteria to consider. In my estimation, how­
ever, it will take at least a generation or two until Khoisan revivalism’s mission 
will perhaps begin to seem obsolete. From being dismissed as passive relics of 
the past to assertively demanding recognition and reviving their culture, the 
Khoisan have certainly come a long way since Khoisan revivalism’s inception 
in the late 1990s. Indeed, what a decade or two ago could be described as a 
fringe movement has over the years evolved into a broad-​based multifaceted 
phenomenon. Khoisan revivalism’s historical trajectory even seems to have 
come full circle with Khoisan revivalists with links to institutions of higher 
learning producing their own academic critiques. While Barrow’s assessment 
was always flawed, South Africans are today more than ever confronted with 
anything but vanishing Khoisan. They are increasingly faced with people like 
Burgess, embracing their newfound ‘beingness’ and compelling her fellow 
South Africans to ‘listen’ to her. Not only have I tried to ‘listen’ and develop 
arguments and concepts in a way that takes her call and that of countless other 
Khoisan revivalists seriously, it is my sincere hope that this book will stimulate 
others to do the same.
