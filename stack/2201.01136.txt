We deﬁne a general mathematical framework for linguistics based on the theory of
ﬁbrations, called FibLang.
We start by modelling the interaction between linguistics and cognition in the
most general way possible, focusing on conceptually motivating any assumption we
make. The advantage is that FibLang remains agnostic to any particular axiomatization
of grammar one may choose.
As such, it is compatible with existing categorical
language models (such as DisCoCat), providing a formally sound framework to apply
mathematical tools developed in the context of category theory, mainly categorical
logic, to the study of language.

Introduction
The work of N. Chomsky is considered revolutionary in linguistics. Among the many reasons
this approach is impactful, the major one is that it gave researchers a formal system to reason
about linguistic phenomena [9]. Later on, this work was recast in category-theoretic terms
by J. Lambek, ﬁrst employing sequent calculus [40] and ultimately the theory of so-called
pregroups [39, 43, 42], particular instances of compact closed categories.
The work of Lambek conjugates grammar in algebraic terms: it postulates that linguistic
structures are made up of linguistic ‘atoms’ – nouns, adjectives, verbs – that can be put
together and then reduced into complex linguistic structures – sentences, noun phrases –
leveraging the pregroup structure. As such, language can be treated as a compositional
structure because it results from a composition of its parts.
In the 2000s a connection between the pregroup approach and categorical quantum
mechanics [1, 11] started to be explored, providing a useful deﬁnition of semantics in
distributional terms, commonly known as DisCoCat [13]. Here, grammatical types are
mapped to vector spaces containing statistical information about the words of that type.

Fibrational linguistics
Grammatical reductions are mapped to linear operations, fusing the statistical properties of
the linguistic constituents into statistical properties of the resulting sentences. This has been
particularly useful in quantum natural language processing and spawned even more research,
culminating in recent contributions such as DisCoCirc [15], that are currently being tested
and implemented on quantum computers [12, 51].
In parallel to this, categories have been used to describe models of meaning, where the
focus shifts from computational applications to cognitive ones. Multiple models have been
used as a starting point for categorical formalization, such as conceptual spaces, originally
deﬁned by Gärdenfors [29] and formalized categorically in [6].
The conceptual spaces approach has been fruitful but did not come without shortcomings,
such as the diﬃculty of producing something more than toy models [23]. Moreover, it gave
for granted many assumptions that may not be so readily accepted by some researchers [21].
Scope of the paper
The present work attempts to deﬁne a general theory of language and meaning, which we
refer to as ‘ﬁbrational linguistics’ (FibLang). We have two main ‘desiderata’ in mind:
• We are agnostic on the structure of language. Following Lambek, we model language
as a category L, but we strive to make no additional assumption about L and any
additional properties that it might satisfy. This highly general attitude informs our
Deﬁnition 5.1, and, more generally, all the ‘foundational’ parts of this work in §5.
• We treat semantics as a black box. The spate of applications of Lambek’s approach
of category theory to linguistics relies on the fact that we can model language as a
syntactic object; works such as [6] highlight the semantic nature of meaning. Systems
like [19, 20] build on notions of convexity that work well in modelling speciﬁc concepts
such as colour and taste but fall short when one attempts to use them in full generality.
We concur in positing that the interplay between language and meaning can be captured
through category-theoretic methods but try to do so by giving up on any controversial
assumption.
To attain these two ambitious goals, we will turn some postulates about how categorial
linguistics is done, and in particular the rôle of meaning, upside-down. This can be sum-
marized in the slogan ‘grammar is algebraic, meaning is coalgebraic’ that we will come to
motivate in the following sections.
To make such a general approach workable, we will employ some basic facts in the
theory of ﬁbrations of categories. We assume some familiarity with category theory (see,
e.g. [47, 36]) and no familiarity with ﬁbrations whatsoever, for which the go-to reference
for the subject is [31].
We will intentionally employ friendly language, especially when building examples and
presenting simpliﬁed versions of the main deﬁnitions. This design choice has two main
motivations: ﬁrst, our main concern is to convey the intuitive concepts that justify our stance

on the philosophy of language without making things too heavy on the formal side. For
this reason, we also decided to postpone the treatment of possible applications to another
paper [22]. Second, we hope this work might catch the attention of members of communities
that usually lack a solid mathematical background –for example, actual linguists.

What meaning can(not) be
A genuine question that spawns in the mind of anyone curious about language is the following:
‘what goes on in people’s heads while they speak? What is meaning?’ Here, experience
teaches a hard lesson: almost any answer will inevitably leave much to be desired. The
reasons for this are many, but we humbly pinpoint a couple:
Diﬀerent people think in diﬀerent ways: some people, for instance, have a distinctly spa-
tial intuition and visualise the object of their discourse; others do not, a condition
known as aphantasia [62, 16]. Some people have an internal monologue when they
read [52]; others do not [44]. As such, what could be very intuitive for someone could
feel wrong for someone else, and while there might be general patterns to describe
language acquisition, formation and usage, no model for cognition is universal. In-
deed, according to the Russian School, cognition is strongly dependent on the social
context in which it occurs [45].
There is more than language going on: in modelling meaning, we are using language to
formalise and convey what we think meaning is. This tacitly assumes that cognitive
processes can be fully described within language. Thinking about it, this constitutes
a huge, possibly unjustiﬁed leap of faith, or at least an extreme simpliﬁcation because
some cognitive processes deﬁning abstract terms are local and dependent on the
culture of reference [61]
From the perspective of someone interested in modelling meaning mathematically, these
considerations make the ‘problem of meaning’ almost untreatable: the only thing we may
safely venture to say is that a putative category D of ‘meanings’ shall be treated as some
black box attached to a speaker 𝑝of a language L. The internal structure of D is modelled
on L, but its underpinnings are mostly inaccessible to anyone but 𝑝.
This means that, at least at a superﬁcial level, there is little to no mathematics involved
in describing what exactly happens while one learns something, or what exactly happens
when ideas inform language, and vice versa. However, even when assuming that a theory
of meaning is essentially inaccessible, we realise that there is something mathematical to
say about what happens when language is shared, extended, or changed upon use because
one can attempt to model these circumstances as the eﬀects of operations performed on the
category L that encodes the language in study.
As such, our ﬁrst deﬁnition attempts to encode the fact that given a language L, its
speakers ‘exist’ in a universe parametric over L; if language is a mathematical object (a
category), a speaker of said language is another object modelled over that category.

Fibrational linguistics
Heuristics 2.1. The following intuitive idea informs the deﬁnition: a speaker 𝑝‘gathers’
meanings that they attribute to a word 𝐿∈L in a collection D𝐿forming a ‘bundle’ over L.
The exact way D𝐿is formed coincides with some process of ‘understanding’ that a speaker
𝑝undergoes to clarify the meaning of 𝐿. Such a process is unavoidably contextual: the
collection D𝐿is big or small depending on the ‘environment’ in which 𝑝is immersed. The
exact nature of this formation process is of great philosophical interest, but at the moment it
does not concern us very much: the focus is on the conglomerate D formed as the ‘union’
Ð
𝐿D𝐿and on the fact that albeit in this picture L remains a syntactic object,
• its nature is never speciﬁed, and thus can be ‘anything’ we deem natural to describe
the language L from outside, and
• D stands on a diﬀerent ground than L: if the latter contains words, the former contains
meaning.
This leads us to formulate a very concise deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 2.2 (Speaker). A speaker is a functor 𝑝: D 𝑝→L.
This might seem just a pointless relabeling of a mathematical object into an evocative
concept. For this reason, we now aim at motivating it better, culminating later on with a
series of examples that will hopefully clarify in what sense the parallel between languages
and categories can be re-interpreted, departing from a purely syntactic perspective to one
where syntax and semantics determine, at least partly, each other.
In Deﬁnition 2.2, D 𝑝represents a collection of concepts, or meanings, that a particular
speaker 𝑝attributes to words and wants to convey at a given time in a given context. It
can be thought of as a snapshot of the speaker’s brain and, as such, it can (and will) change
under ‘pressure’ (time, social interactions, changes in grammar and semantics due to cultural
shifts, wars, ﬂoods, technological advancement. . . ).
The category L instead is meant to represents language; at this stage of the discussion
it is not clear what kind of properties we have to require for L: it can be treated as a purely
syntactic object (borrowing from the ‘tradition’ of categorical linguistics, from [40] to [13,
10]) or not: we argue that following the latter path leads to a more fruitful interpretation
for how category theory can shed light on linguistics, and we further develop our posture
in [22].
Remark 2.3. Readers familiar with approaches such as DisCoCat may be surprised by Def-
inition 2.2, as previous work assumes functors going from grammar to semantics and not
the other way around. Our approach is motivated by the fact that the grammar category, as
a purely syntactical structure, is usually ‘thinner’ than the semantics category. For instance,
there may be many diﬀerent meanings mapping to the same word or sentence and many
more morphisms between meanings than grammatical reductions. In the case of DisCoCat,
this handwavy consideration can be made precise in that a pregroup L is formally a thin
category, and this has drawbacks: indeed, considering functors from a pregroup to, say, the
category of ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces gives rise to pathological behaviour as stressed

Genovese, Loregian, Puca

out in the work of Preller [54, 53], further justifying Deﬁnition 2.2, that moreover reﬂects
the idea of grammar as an abstraction projected out from meaning and language.
The internal structure of L, intended as its properties as a category, can be a subject of
endless debate, given that there is no widespread, deﬁnitive consensus about what language
is –apart from a smoky deﬁnition ultimately motivated by a philosophical stance.
Given this, in FibLang we posit L being at least a category, mainly since it has been
widely accepted –starting at least from the earliest works of Chomsky– that language has
some degree of compositionality. But we make no further assumption on the L that can
be interesting, and instead, we formulate an extremely loose notion of linguistic doctrine in
Deﬁnition 5.1: a (linguistic) doctrine a subcategory LD ⊆Cat whose objects are categories
deﬁned by some additional property or structure (see also the rest of section 5, and a roundup
of examples in Example 2.4, 2.5, and 4.4). Usual classes of posetal categories [41, 3, 40,
27] are legitimate choices for linguistic doctrines, but other choices are possible.
Example 2.4. The categories of Lambek protogroups and pregroups [41], Ajdukiewicz-
Bar-Hillel pomonoids [3, 4], residuated pomonoids [40], Grishin pomonoids [27] are all
examples of linguistic doctrines in the sense of Deﬁnition 5.1.
Example 2.5. Likewise, ‘syntactic categories’ of various sorts, like categories with a pre-
scribed class of limits, are all examples of linguistic doctrines.
If language is (with few exceptions) widely accepted to be compositional to some degree,
on the other hand, meaning (i.e., the ‘mental image’1 that 𝑝builds upon L) stands on a
diﬀerent ground: it certainly is ‘something that 𝑝does with language’; it certainly is subject
to a certain degree of compositionality –from one extreme, not compositional at all, in which
case D 𝑝would be a discrete category, just a set, to the opposite. But, most importantly, it
can be compositional in diﬀerent ways depending on diﬀerent speakers in diﬀerent social or
learning contexts.
Example 2.6. Two speakers, Alice and Bob, may interpret the sentence ‘the cat sleeps’ in
diﬀerent ways, as in Figure 1. Alternatively, Figure 1 may represent the meaning of the same
sentence at diﬀerent times for the same speaker.
Even worse, the same speaker 𝑝may think about diﬀerent cats in the sentences ‘the cat
sleeps’ and ‘the cat is fat’. In this case, it is debatable –at least since the times of Plato–
that there is a single meaning of the word cat that can be used in both sentences to infer the
meaning of the sentences as a whole.
Remark 2.7 (A counterpoint to Heuristics 2.1). A mere functor D 𝑝→L does not contain
enough information in order for the categories D𝐿to vary ‘coherently’ with the structure
of L; this gives us a way to introduce the main mathematical tool in FibLang, the theory of
ﬁbrations over a category.
Intuitively speaking, this is exactly what a ﬁbration

is for: deﬁne a category E

Fibrations over languages
Intuitively, a ﬁbration is a functor 𝑝♯: E →C that realises the category E as a ‘covering’ of
C, in such a way that each morphism 𝑓: 𝐶→𝐶′ in C can be lifted to a morphism in E, so
(in the case of what we call a discrete ﬁbration) to induce functions between the ﬁbres in E.
The original deﬁnition of this class of functors was given by A. Grothendieck, mimicking
a similar concept in algebraic topology, where a ﬁbration (of topological spaces) is deﬁned
as a continuous function

lifting paths 𝛾: [0,1] →𝐵to paths in 𝐸. The analogy is
meaningful, categories being in suitable sense models of ‘directed’ spaces (cf. [24]), but
the categorical theory of ﬁbrations exhibits an additional layer of complexity since we must
distinguish ﬁbrations (inducing morphisms in the opposite direction of 𝑓: 𝐶→𝐶′) and
opﬁbrations, inducing morphism in the same direction of 𝑓.
Deﬁnition 3.1 (Fibration). A functor 𝑝♯: E →C is a discrete ﬁbration (for us, just a
ﬁbration) if, for every object 𝐸in E and every morphism 𝑓: 𝐶→𝑝♯𝐸with 𝐶in C, there
exists a unique morphism ℎ: 𝐸′ →𝐸such that 𝑝♯ℎ= 𝑓.
For notational convenience, functors that are ﬁbrations will always be denoted with a ♯.
Basic facts on ﬁbrations are recalled in a separate Appendix.
Notation 3.2. The domain of a ﬁbration 𝑝♯: E →C is usually called the total category of
the ﬁbration, and its codomain is the base category. Given any functor 𝑝we can deﬁne the
ﬁbre of 𝑝over an object 𝐶∈C, i.e. the subcategory E𝐶= { 𝑓: 𝐸→𝐸′ | 𝑝𝑓= 1𝐶} ⊆E.
Remark 3.3. The ﬁbration property for 𝑝: E →C entails that ﬁbres are discrete subcate-
gories of the total category (that is, they are sets) and given a morphism 𝑓: 𝐶→𝐶′ in C

Genovese, Loregian, Puca

we can deﬁne a function 𝑓∗, called reindexing function, from the ﬁbre E𝐶′ to the ﬁbre E𝐶,
sending 𝑋∈E𝐶′ to the domain 𝑋′ of the unique ℎ: 𝑋′ →𝑋such that 𝑝♯ℎ= 𝑓, which is by
construction an object in E𝐶.
We have represented an elementary example of ﬁbration in the following ﬁgure, where
the grey rectangles are the ﬁbres of the ﬁbration.

each and the ﬁbre over 𝐶consists of two elements; the function 𝑓∗: E𝐵→E𝐴induced by
𝑓sends 𝐵0 to 𝐴0 and 𝐵1, 𝐵2 both to 𝐴2.
Now we clarify how ﬁbrations relate to the considerations we made back in section 2. It
is clear to every one acquainted with categorical approaches to language how Deﬁnition 2.2
was too general to be workable. The notion of ﬁbration seems to ﬁx exactly the kind of issue
we would have faced staying in the generality of section 2. What seems to be just a happy
coincidence ends up being utterly justiﬁed by the following result:
Theorem 3.4 (Dual of [57, Theorem 3]). Any functor 𝑝: D 𝑝→L can be written as a
composition of functors D 𝑝𝑠−→E 𝑝
𝑝♯
−−→L, such that 𝑝♯is a ﬁbration.
This result that we recall in Construction A.9 below has a direct interpretation in our
framework. First, it informs us that we are ’losing nothing’ in considering ﬁbrations: as
any functor can be factored canonically through a ﬁbration, we do not need any further
assumptions to inject ﬁbrations into what has been up to now, a very general picture. We
immediately take advantage of this by casting the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 3.5 (Speakers, recast). In light of Theorem 3.4, given a speaker D 𝑝
𝑝−→L
factorizing as D 𝑝𝑠−→E 𝑝
𝑝♯
−−→L, we will often abuse notation and refer to 𝑝♯as ‘the speaker
𝑝’. In short, from now on we postulate that speakers are ﬁbrations.
Having reassured ourselves how considering ﬁbrations does not lead to any loss of
generality, let us look at what Theorem 3.4 means in the context of language. The functor 𝑠
is projecting the ‘black box category’ D 𝑝where meanings live to a category E 𝑝. We interpret
E 𝑝as the category, ﬁbred over L, where concepts have been arranged fully compositionally
over the underlying language L. All the possible meanings of an element of the language
𝐿∈L constitute the ﬁbre over it.

The procedure outlined in [57] builds a ﬁbration out of 𝑝: D 𝑝→L, in a canonical way;
this has to be interpreted as follows: there is a procedure (an algorithm, a construction, a
recipe) that a speaker applies to the mental image D 𝑝they have built upon L, that makes
D 𝑝ﬁt to the language L (preserving as much structure as the speaker can), and ready to be
shared with other speakers in a meaningful way.
Example 3.6. Going back to our example sentence ‘the cat sleeps’, in Figure 3 we see how
its meaning, which is not necessarily compositional over the sentence, factorises into a string
of concepts that are compositional over the words forming the sentence itself. Moreover,
given how general Theorem 3.4 is, we see that such ‘compositionalization’ of concepts
works out for whatever structure we assume on the underlying language.

Fibrations bear gifts
Thinking ﬁbrationally gave us far more conceptual insights than we may originally have
expected. Indeed, in the ﬁrst draft of this paper we assumed opﬁbrations, which can be
understood as ﬁbrations whose reindexing functions are covariant with respect to morphisms
in the base. This felt wrong for many reasons; for example, it drew a stark contrast with the
common approach to categorical logic, which has greatly inspired us from the start. As it
often happens in category theory, following any insights given by the mathematical model
one is drafting is more rewarding than trying to bend the model to one’s will.

Genovese, Loregian, Puca

To fully explain our model’s philosophical insights, we will have to make a short
digression. Consider the meaning of the word ‘cat’. One may say that the pictures in Figure 1
could represent this word. Indeed, the idea of depicting the meaning in pictorial terms [14]
works very well for nouns. However, it is diﬃcult to generalise this insight to verbs: if we ask
a hypothetical speaker to ‘imagine a cat’, the speaker may promptly evoke a mental image
of a cat. However, can we play the same mental experiment by asking a speaker to depict
the meaning of ‘swimming’? We face the evident problem that ‘swimming’ is a highly
contextual linguistic constituent that needs to be paired with a subject to work properly. This
apparent diﬀerence in behaviour can be resolved if we realise how the speaker is not evoking
the meaning of single, atomic constituents of language, but the meaning of sentences. In this
interpretation, pictures in Figure 1 represent the meaning of the sentence ‘the cat sleeps’,
together with the meaning of many other sentences that appropriately describe the pictures
considered. When asked to imagine a cat, the speaker can project the cat out of these
pictures, going from the meaning of a fully speciﬁed sentence to one of its constituents.
Similarly, the meaning of ‘swimming’ can be represented in the same way by evoking,
for instance, a mental image of ‘someone that swims’, and then projecting out the dynamic
part of this sentence. This point of view turns the algebraic approach to grammar upside-
down: we are not building meanings from atomic constituents but decomposing fully formed
meanings into atomic abstractions that depend on context to exist properly. Many recent
results in machine learning indeed conﬁrm this idea: algorithms can translate images to
text [60], and text to images [55], and isolate or blend elements in an image [17] – such as
taking the cat out of a picture of a cat and replacing it with another cat. In doing so, the role
of sentences is central, as isolated linguistic constituents such as words and particles carry
too little context with them to be successfully employable in these tasks.
These considerations brought us to believe that grammar is algebraic, meaning is coal-
gebraic: the former obtains sentences by composing together atomic linguistic constituents,
whereas the latter projects and decomposes the meaning of sentences to the meaning of its
atomic constituents. Having realised this, it is now apparent that the deﬁnition of a ﬁbration,
which induces maps between the ﬁbres varying contravariantly with respect to the language,
is the most appropriate one: language is but a tool guiding us in correctly decomposing men-
tal pictures. We deem it important to stress how all these conceptual realisations stemmed
directly from our endeavour to make our model mathematically more natural, not the other
way around.
Example 4.1. If we follow the mantra of DisCoCat [13, 18, 26] and postulate that L is a
pregroup, that is, a thin compact closed category freely generated over a vocabulary [43,
35], then there is a morphism
(the cat,𝑛) ⊗(sleeps,𝑛𝑙· 𝑠)
𝑓−→(the cat sleeps,𝑠)
(4.1)
where 𝑛denotes the noun type and 𝑠the sentence type. For this example, we can deﬁne a toy
semantics by deﬁning the ﬁbre over every word as the set of sentences that employ that word.

10
Fibrational linguistics
So, for instance, the ﬁbre over (the cat,𝑛) contains all the possible sentences employing ‘the
cat’ (which may also include categories). An analogous discourse holds for (sleeps,𝑛𝑙· 𝑠),
while the ﬁbre over (the cat sleeps,𝑠) is a singleton. The ‘meaning’ of the morphism 𝑓is
then given by a section that pics the same element in every ﬁbre: the sentence the cat sleeps.
This example is a toy model, but we deem it very insightful as it constitutes a ﬁrst, shy
step towards the idea of doing distributional models of meaning by assuming distributional
statistics of sentences instead of distributional statistics of words. Furthermore, we were
happy to discover that similar approaches are currently being investigated by other research
groups [14].
Example 4.2. Let us now build up from the previous example, while also keeping in
mind Figure 2. Let us consider the ﬁbres over elements (the cat,𝑛) ⊗(sleeps,𝑛𝑙· 𝑠) and
(the cat sleeps,𝑠), respectively. Furthermore, let us suppose for the sake of simplicity that
our ﬁbration

D 𝑝
𝑝♯↓
L

, whatever D 𝑝is, is furthermore strict monoidal, meaning that
D 𝑝
(the cat,𝑛) ⊗(sleeps,𝑛𝑙·𝑠) = D 𝑝
(the cat,𝑛) × D 𝑝
(sleeps,𝑛𝑙·𝑠).
An element in D 𝑝
(the cat sleeps,𝑠) represents a meaning of the sentence the cat sleeps. Now
let’s focus on the reduction 𝑓of Equation 4.1 and on its corresponding reindexing function:
(the cat,𝑛) ⊗(sleeps,𝑛𝑙· 𝑠)
𝑓−→(the cat sleeps,𝑠)
D 𝑝
(the cat sleeps,𝑠) →D 𝑝
(the cat,𝑛) × D 𝑝
(sleeps,𝑛𝑙·𝑠)
The reindexing is mapping meanings of the cat sleeps to meanings of its constituents. As
such, we see very explicitly how language can be seen as a blueprint to decompose the
meaning of sentences: the sentence structure, going forward from components to complete
sentences via reduction, informs us how to go backwards from the meaning of the sentence
to the meaning of its constituents.
Interestingly, we notice that whereas the meaning of a sentence can be mapped exactly to
one pair of meanings of its constituents ( 𝑓induces a function), the opposite is not true: The
same pair (𝑎,𝑏) in D 𝑝
(the cat,𝑛) × D 𝑝
(sleeps,𝑛𝑙·𝑠) could correspond to many diﬀerent meanings
in D 𝑝
(the cat sleeps,𝑠), as visually suggested in Figure 2. This suggests that:
• In FibLang, meaning is truly coalgebraic, in that it provides a well-deﬁned way to go
from the meaning of a concept to the meanings of it constituents, not the other way
around;
• The process of ’merging meanings’ is inherently ambiguous: thinking about a cat and
about a bed is not enough to form the thought of a cat sleeping, as the latter contains
many more details that may not be present in the components. As such, merging
thoughts really is a creative process.
As we hinted above, the ﬁbrational description of languages establishes almost by default
links to what is perhaps one of the most illustrious uses of category theory in logic [5, 58]:

Genovese, Loregian, Puca

Remark 4.3. Once a signature in the sense of [31, §1.6] Σ is speciﬁed, we can build contexts
as strings of declarations Γ = (𝑥1 : 𝜎1,...,𝑥𝑛: 𝜎𝑛), and assess judgments like
Γ ⊢𝑋: 𝜏
(4.2)
to express that in context Γ, a term 𝑋has type 𝜏∈Σ.
To every signature, one can associate a classifying category C(Σ), whose objects are
contexts Γ above, and whose morphisms are suitable substitutions of terms one inside the
other.
Now, there is an equivalence between
• models for the theory that the signature prescribes;
• functors C(Σ) →Set that preserve ﬁnite products;
• certain ﬁbrations


over C(Σ).
Such a ﬁbration in the last item has as ﬁbre over a given Γ ∈C(Σ) precisely the cat-
egory/poset of judgments 𝑋: 𝜏that are valid in context Γ, i.e.
all the judgments like
(4.2).
In conclusion, a good parallel with our model for language representation –although a
naive one for the reader versed in categorical logic– is that as much as a ﬁbre of

set of meanings that can be attributed to 𝐿by 𝑝♯.
This is not all, as the ﬁbrational approach keeps on giving: Remark 4.3 allows us to
formulate another example to add to our list in Example 2.4-Example 2.5.
Example 4.4. The linguistic doctrine of maximally connected groupoids2 can be a tentative
model for chaotic structures where ‘all words mean the same’; experimental artlangs as
Zaum [38, 37, 32] (the ‘transrational’ or ‘beyonsensical’ language of the Russian avant-
garde movement of early 20th century), Marinetti’s Paroliberismo [50, 46] and D. Stratos’
vocal experimentalism [56], as well as C. Vander’s Kobaïan [48, 49] constitute examples
of such situations where the lack of deﬁnite meaning for words allows for fuller expression
based on ‘pure sound’ experience.
Given an object L ∈MCG, it is of the form G𝐴for the functor G of [25, §3] and some set
𝐴; thus, a functor 𝑝: E →L is uniquely determined by its function on objects 𝑝0 : E0 →L0,
and using the ﬁbration property of Deﬁnition A.5 (and in particular the fact that a cartesian
lift of an isomorphism is also an isomorphism) one can prove that
2A maximally connected groupoid (MCG for short) is a category G with the property that there exists
precisely one morphism between any two given objects; this uniqueness implies that every morphism 𝑎→𝑏is
invertible, having as inverse the unique morphism 𝑏→𝑎; an MCG is ‘completely isotropic’, in that no object
of it can be distinguished from any other object. In this sense, an MCG is a structure that does not carry more
information than the mere set of its objects.
Figure 4 depicts the ﬁrst few maximally connected groupoids on sets with 1,2,3,4 elements.

Figure 4: Maximally connected groupoids of cardinality 𝑛= 1,2,3,4; the category structure
of G𝐴is uniquely determined by the set of objects 𝐴, and sending 𝐴to G𝐴deﬁnes a functor
G : Set →Cat (cf. [25, §3]). All objects in a MCG are isomorphic in a unique way.
• all ﬁbres have the same cardinality (so, we ﬁx a set 𝑋of such cardinality);

(4.3)
Conceptually, this captures the idea that in these models ‘all words mean the same’ – since all
words are isomorphic in L and all ﬁbres have the same cardinality. As we summarized above,
in these models meaning is conveyed by relying on sound experience and free association
of words more than relying on structured grammar.
To conclude this section, we set to reconcile our diﬀerences between FibLang and
other categorical models of meaning. As we stressed in Remark 2.3, FibLang is somewhat
‘upside-down’ in that we are considering functors from meaning to grammar, whereas many
other approaches do the opposite. The following theorem allows us to recast FibLang in
more familiar terms, although conceptually less insightful:
Theorem 4.5. Observe that there is a category DFib/L of ﬁbrations over a given L, where a
map ℎ:

E 𝑝
𝑝♯↓
L

→

E𝑞
𝑞♯↓
L

is a functor ℎ: E 𝑝→E𝑞such that 𝑞♯·ℎ= 𝑝♯(see Deﬁnition A.4).
There is an equivalence of categories:
∇: DFib/L  [Lop,Set] :
∫
(4.4)
where at the left-hand side, we have the category of all functors Lop →Set and natural
transformations thereof. The functor 𝐹↦→
∫
𝐹is often called the category of elements
construction, or in its most general form the Grothendieck constuction.
We revise this
construction in Appendix A.

Example 4.6 (Connecting DisCoCat and FibLang). Theorem 4.5 sheds light on the con-
nection between FibLang and DisCoCat: let L be a Lambek pregroup and consider the
functor 𝐹: L →Set sending any object (string,type) of L to the underlying set of the
one-dimensional subspace ⟨string⟩in the ambient space type. Applying
∫
−we obtain
a ﬁbration
∫
𝐹where the meaning over each object is the distributional meaning of that
object as prescribed by DisCoCat.
On the other hand, applying ∇−to our ﬁbration 𝑝♯, we get a functor ∇𝑝♯: L →Set that
sends every object (string,type) to the set of meanings that the string can have, in a way
that is compatible with the morphisms of L. This recovers the usual correspondence from
grammar to semantics, as seen in other categorical approaches.

Formal foundations for ﬁbrational linguistics
Having explained our point of view in the friendliest way we could and feeling to have
conceptually motivated our deﬁnitions, we conclude this work by describing FibLang from
a more mathematical standpoint.
Our main tool is the notion of ﬁbration as deﬁned in Deﬁnition A.1, and a number of
well-known categorical constructions (mainly, comma objects [7, p. 1.6] and pullbacks [7,
p. 2.5], given that (cf. [31, p. 1.5.1]) the class of ﬁbrations is closed under comma/pullbacks
in Cat).
Borrowing from a common terminology to refer to interesting subcategories of Cat (cf.
[2, 8]), we give the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 5.1 (Linguistic doctrine). We call a (linguistic) doctrine a subcategory LD ⊆Cat.
Apart from the usual notational conventions, we
• denote with letters L,L′ and the like the objects of a linguistic doctrine of sorts; the
generic object L ∈LD will be called a language;
• denote as 𝑈: LD →Cat the forgetful functor discarding the information that L is an
object of LD. So, writing 𝑈L is merely a way to refer to L ∈LD just as a bare category.
Deﬁnition 5.2 (The category Fab(L)). In the above notation, let L be a language, 1
the terminal category (having a single object and a single identity morphism) and let
⌈L⌉: 1 →Cat the functor selecting the object 𝑈L ∈Cat.
Consider the comma category at the upper left corner of the square
𝑈/L

⌈L⌉

(5.1)
The category Fab(L) is deﬁned as the full subcategory of 𝑈/L spanned by the ﬁbrations

E
𝑝↓
L

. In simple words, Fab(L) has

• as morphisms between


and

F

L

all functors 𝐻: E →F such that 𝑞· 𝐻= 𝑝.
Observe that a morphism of ﬁbrations 𝐻:


L

→

F

L

commutes with the reindexing
operations of Notation 3.2, inducing functors 𝐻𝐿: E𝐿→F𝐿between each two ﬁbres that
ﬁts into commutative squares

(5.2)
This means (as it should) as morphisms between

E
𝑝↓
L

and

F
𝑞↓
L

translates into a natural
transformation between the associated functors Lop →Set.
Deﬁnition 5.3 (The category of extended languages). The assignment L ↦→Fab(L) can
be seen as a functor LDop →Cat, acting on morphisms as pullback, from which using the
Grothendieck construction of Proposition A.8 we can obtain a ﬁbration

ELang
Λ
↓
LD

that we
dub the category of extended languages. A typical object in the total category of Λ is a pair
(L, 𝑝∈Fab(L)), and a typical morphism (L, 𝑝) →(L′,𝑞) consists of a functor L →L′
such that 𝐻· 𝑝= 𝑞.
Remark 5.4. The category of extended languages is conceptually quite important (it collects
in a single environment all speakers of all languages), but it has very little practical interest
because it contains too many objects and too few morphisms. In fact, by construction, there
can be a morphism between objects 𝑝,𝑞only if their domains coincide. However, this is
quite restrictive and unnatural as a request on speakers because it entails that 𝑝,𝑞have built
the same mental image of their possibly diﬀerent languages: communication is only possible
between speakers of diﬀerent languages that share a common worldview.
If anything, we are interested in the opposite situation, namely modelling the process of
• comparing worldviews of speakers of a ﬁxed common language L, and even better,
• let speakers of very diﬀerent languages, possibly having very diﬀerent total categories,
interact together.
To this end, we shall consider a ‘compatible’ arrow category on the objects of Fab(L);
objects here are the morphisms

E

, and a morphism between 𝑝and 𝑞consists of a

(5.3)
Here, 𝐹must lie in the image of 𝑈, i.e., it arises from a functor that is a homomorphism for
the doctrine of deﬁnition. The rationale is that we want to compare L,L′ just as categories,
but we want to consider morphisms that are structure-preserving for the deﬁning properties
of the doctrine LD.
Deﬁnition 5.5 (The category Fab→). Let LD be a linguistic doctrine, and 𝑈: LD →Cat
its forgetful functor. The category Fab→is obtained from the comma category (Cat/𝑈)
appearing as left upper corner of the following comma square
(Cat/𝑈)
/

 
Cat
LD
𝑈

(5.4)
as the full subcategory of (Cat/𝑈) spanned by ﬁbrations 𝑝: E →𝑈L.
Unwinding the deﬁnition, the category Fab→has
• objects the ﬁbrations

𝑈L

,


;
• morphisms from 𝑝to 𝑞the commutative squares as in (5.3).
The category Fab→represents the formal environment underlying FibLang. As we strive
for friendliness and intercommunication with researchers in other ﬁelds such as pure lin-
guistics, Fab→will be often obscured or just referenced in upcoming works such as [22].
Nevertheless, we consider it to be of great value, as it is here that our mathematical intuition
takes shape.
6
Conclusion and future work
This work focused on giving and conceptually motivating the core of FibLang. In upcoming
work [22] we will focus on applications such as vocabulary acquisition and communication.
Another clear direction of future work is dropping the requisite of our ﬁbrations to be
discrete, as allowing more structure in the ﬁbres over words may help capture interesting
phenomena.
In this sense, the comprehensive factorization of [57] can be generalized
without pain to the factorization of a 2-functor 𝐹between 2-categories along a canonically
chosen non-discrete ﬁbration.

A
Category theory paraphernalia
It is an old idea dating back to Grothendieck [28, 59] that the correspondence between
sheaves and local homeomorphisms on a space 𝑋can be generalized to non-thin categories.
In fact, every small category C shall be thought of as some sort of ‘generalized space’ [34,
30]; in this perspective, every functor 𝐹: Cop →Cat -not only those deﬁned over a category
of open subsets- shall be thought as a certain generalized ﬁbre bundle over C, whose ﬁbres
are exactly the categories 𝐹𝐶.
The so-called Grothendieck construction substantiates this idea into a precise theorem,
and the theory of ﬁbrations provides an analogue for the notion of a space/category ‘lying
over’ another and for the notion of local homeomorphism.
In the following, we let C be a small category; a thorough presentation of the theory of
ﬁbrations is the scope of [31, Ch. 1] and [33, B1]; our aim is just to make the axiomatics in
the following subsection slightly more self-contained. In all that follows, E,C are categories
nd 𝑝: E →C is a functor.
Deﬁnition A.1 (Fibration). The functor 𝑝is called a ﬁbration if the functor

has a right adjoint right inverse, i.e. a right adjoint 𝑟: C/𝑝𝐸→E/𝐸with invertible counit
(𝑠,𝑡: E2 →E are the source and target functors).3
The domain of a ﬁbration 𝑝is often called the total category, and its codomain the base
of the ﬁbration.
Unwinding Deﬁnition A.1, one can see that a functor 𝑝is a ﬁbration if and only if the
following condition is satisﬁed:
Every arrow 𝐶→𝑝𝐸in the base has a canonical choice for a cartesian lift.
A (𝑝)-cartesian lift (called a prone morphism in [33]) for 𝑢: 𝐶→𝐶′ consists of a
morphism 𝑓: 𝐸→𝐸′ with the following property: 𝑝𝑓= 𝑢and for every object 𝑍∈E, and
every pair of morphisms 𝑔: 𝑍→𝐸′ above and 𝑤: 𝑝𝑍→𝑝𝐸= 𝐶below, arranged in the
following manner,

(A.3)
there exists a unique ℎ: 𝑍→𝐸ﬁlling the triangle in E and mapping it to the triangle in C
along 𝑝.
A lot of properties can be deduced from the fact that a certain functor is a ﬁbration: the
one that is of interest for us is that such a cartesian lift for a given 𝐶→𝑝𝐸is unique up to a
unique isomorphism when it exists.
This ensures that the following fundamental property is true:
3Strictly speaking, this is the deﬁnition of a cloven or split ﬁbration; but we are not interested in marking
the diﬀerence between the more general concept of a ﬁbration and a split one, since it would ultimately only
obfuscate the intuition. For examples of ﬁbrations that are not cloven, see [58, p. 10].

Given a morphism 𝑢: 𝐶→𝐶′ in the base category, there is a functor 𝑢∗: E𝐶′ →
E𝐶, where E𝐴is the ﬁbre of 𝑝over 𝐴.
Remark A.2. The proof that the ﬁbration property entails the existence of reindexings 𝑢∗is
well-known and can be found in any introductory text on ﬁbration theory: given an object
𝑋∈E𝐶′, the arrow 𝑢: 𝐶→𝑝𝑋has a cartesian lift; 𝑢∗𝑋is the (uniquely determined) domain
of such cartesian lift.
Remark A.3. In general this only deﬁnes a pseudofunctor Cop →Cat sending 𝐶to E𝐶
and 𝑢: 𝐶→𝐶to 𝑢∗: E𝐶′ →E𝐶, because although the isomorphisms 𝑢∗◦𝑣∗ (𝑣◦𝑢)∗and
1∗
𝐶 1E𝐶are unique, and determined by the universal property of a cartesian lift, they are
not the identity in general.
Deﬁnition A.4 (The category of ﬁbrations). The category of ﬁbrations over C has
cf1) objects the ﬁbrations 𝑝: E →C over C, regarded as objects of Cat/C;
cf2) morphisms (E, 𝑝) →(F ,𝑞) the morphisms ℎ: E →F of Cat/C that preserve carte-
sian arrows in the domain category;
cf3) 2-cells the natural transformations having ‘𝑞-vertical components’, i.e. those 𝛼: ℎ⇒
ℎ′ is a natural transformation such that 𝑞∗𝛼= 1𝑝.
An important particular instance of Deﬁnition A.1 is when all ﬁbres E𝐶are discrete;
in that case, each reindexing 𝑢∗: E𝐶′ →E𝐶is a function, and we obtain a strict functor
Cop →Set.
Deﬁnition A.5 (Discrete ﬁbration). A ﬁbration 𝑝: E →C is called discrete if for every
morphism 𝑢: 𝐶→𝑝𝐸there exists a unique ℎ: 𝐸′ →𝐸such that 𝑝ℎ= 𝑢.
Remark A.6. The ﬁbres E𝐶of a functor 𝑝: E →C play an essential role in the so-called
Grothendieck construction: every pseudofunctor Cop →Cat determines a ﬁbration over C,
its ‘category of elements’; viceversa, given a functor 𝑝: E →C, the correspondence 𝐶↦→E𝐶
can be ‘straightened’ to a functor Cop →Cat if and only if 𝑝is a ﬁbration, following the
recipe described in Remark A.2.
Deﬁnition A.7 (Category of elements). Let 𝑊: Cop →Cat be a functor; the category of
elements
∫
𝑊of 𝑊is the category having
ce1) as objects, the pairs (𝐶∈C,𝑥∈𝑊𝐶);
ce2) as morphisms (𝐶,𝑥) →(𝐶′, 𝑦) those 𝑓∈C(𝐶,𝐶′) such that 𝑊( 𝑓)(𝑦) = 𝑥.
Evidently, for every 𝑊: Cop →Set, the functor

∫
𝑊

sending (𝐶,𝑥) to 𝐶and 𝑓to 𝑓
is a discrete ﬁbration, called the ﬁbration of elements of 𝑊.
The Grothendieck construction relies on the fact that every ﬁbration

of elements of a certain functor 𝑊𝑝: Cop →Set: the functor deﬁned on objects as in
Remark A.2.

Proposition A.8 (The Grothendieck construction). Sending a functor 𝑊: Cop →Set to its
category of elements deﬁnes a fully faithful functor
Cat(Cop,Set)  
/ Cat/C;
(A.4)
whose essential image is the subcategory of discrete ﬁbrations over C.
Construction A.9 (The comprehensive factorization of a functor). Given a functor 𝐹: C →
D, there exist two factorizations of 𝐹into
• a discrete opﬁbration 𝑝: E →D followed by an initial functor;
• a discrete ﬁbration 𝑞: E →D followed by a ﬁnal functor.
The construction of 𝑝given in [57] goes as follows.
Consider the left Kan extension

where E = (∗/𝑘) is the category of elements of 𝑘, and by the Lemma below, a discrete
opﬁbration. The rest of the proof shows that C →E is initial, but since we have little interest
in the properties of this half of the factorization, we refrain from repeating the argument.
The key ingredient for the proof is the following
Lemma A.10. Given a comma square

• the left vertical arrow

is an opﬁbration.
Proof. See [31, Exercise 1.4.6].
□
From here, the claim that 𝑝: (∗/𝑘) →D is a discrete opﬁbration follows; in order to
factor 𝐹as a discrete ﬁbration followed by a ﬁnal functor, just apply the above construction
to the opposite of 𝐹, the functor 𝐹op : Cop →Dop.
