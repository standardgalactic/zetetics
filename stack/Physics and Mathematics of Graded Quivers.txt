Abstract
Physics and Mathematics of Graded Quivers
by
Azeem Hasan
Adviser: Professor Sebastian Franco
A graded quiver with superpotential is a quiver whose arrows are assigned degrees c ∈
{0, 1, · · · , m}, for some integer m ≥0, with relations generated by a superpotential of degree
m −1. For m = 0, 1, 2, 3 they often describe the open string sector of D-brane systems; in
particular, they capture the physics of D(5 −2m)-branes at local Calabi-Yau (CY) (m + 2)-
fold singularities in type IIB string theory. We introduce m-dimers, which fully encode the
m-graded quivers and their superpotentials, in the case in which the CY (m + 2)-folds are
toric. A key result is the generalization of the concept of perfect matching, which plays
a central role in this map, to arbitrary m. We also introduce a simpliﬁed algorithm for
the computation of perfect matchings, which generalizes the Kasteleyn matrix approach
to any m. We also explore various algorithms for constructing dimer models. We give a
physical realization to m-dimers for m > 3, showing that for any m they describe the open
string sector of the topological B-model on Xm+2. We illustrate these ideas explicitly with
a few inﬁnite families of toric singularities indexed by m ∈N, for which we derive graded
quivers associated to the geometry, using several complementary perspectives developed in
this thesis.

Acknowledgments
I would like to thank ﬁrst of all my advisor Prof. Sebastian Franco for his guidance, which
has been invaluable, for his constant urging to do better and for his patience with me on
the occasions I was unable to do so. I have learned a lot from him over the years and will
continue to do so in the future.
I would like to thank the members of the supervisory committee, Prof. Daniel N Kabat,
Prof. Dimitra Karabali, Prof. V.P. Nair and Prof. Alexios Polychronakos especially for their
gentleness while pointing out the areas I need to improve after my second exam. I hope to
be able to convince them that I took their advice seriously.
I would like to thank my collaborators Cyril Closset and Jirui Guo. A big part of the
work presented in thesis would not have been possible without them. I would also like to
thank Prof. Eric Sharpe for his collaboration and his advice which has been of great help
during my last year of graduate studies. It would be remiss of me not to mention the time
he, Cyril and my advisor took out of their busy schedules to write recommendation letters
for me. I am really grateful for it.
I would like to thank Prof. Amer Iqbal and Prof. Babar Qureshi, the two shining lights
during my undergraduate years.
Prof.
Amer Iqbal was the best teacher a new Physics
student could have had, and I will remain indebted to Prof. Babar Qureshi for all the time
he spent teaching me and my fellow students beyond the oﬃcial courses.
I would like to thank my high school physics teachers M.B. Saleem and Abid Ali for their
v

vi
part in the kindling the love of Physics in me.
Most of work the work presented here has already appeared in [1–3]. I would like to
thank the editors and referees for valuable comments and suggestions.
I would like to thank my parents and my siblings for not only acquiescing in but sup-
porting my choice of career which at least in Pakistan is unconventional.
I would like to thank Arthur, Xing, Lei, Cody, Andrew, Toby, Mario, Keith and Destanie,
for being my friends and roommates during my stay in New York and putting up with me.
My work was supported by U.S. National Science Foundation grants PHY-1518967, PHY-
1820721 and PHY-1519449 and a PSC CUNY grant. I am also thankful to the Simons Center
for Geometry and Physics for their hospitality during 2107 and 2108 summer workshops
during which some of the work was completed.

Introduction
One of the lasting insights of the string theory has been the intricate dance of physics
and geometry that it has developed and exploited in its various guises.
The result has
been an ongoing program in which advances in our understanding of quantum ﬁeld theories
and geometry have happened in lockstep. This has been especially true of supersymmetric
quantum ﬁeld theories, since they are better behaved than generic QFT’s. As a result they
and their engineering in string theory have been at the forefront of the quest to understand
the structure of quantum ﬁeld theory.
Among the most successful and widely studied of these constructions have been gauge
theories on the worldvolume of D3-branes. The simplest example of such a theory is a single
D3-brane in the ﬂat 10-dimensional spacetime of superstring theory. In the low energy limit
the resulting theory on the world volume is a quantum ﬁeld theory with U(1) gauge group
and 16 supercharges. In the case of N coincident branes the gauge group enhances to U(N).
Since having 16 supercharges is extremely constraining we can recognize this theory to be
N = 4 Super Yang Mills. The study of this brane conﬁguration by Maldacena resulted in
the celebrated AdS/CFT conjecture [4].
N = 4 SYM has been an important laboratory. Many important ideas which were later

further developed into tools capable of handling more complicated theories were discovered
in its context. AdS/CFT is one such example, another recent one is the ongoing program of
the geometrization of scattering amplitudes [5]. Despite its undeniable importance N = 4
SYM is far from not only a realistic but also a generic theory. So for both phenomenological
(how to embed standard model in string theory?) and formal (how to deﬁne a quantum ﬁeld
theory?) reasons we needed models with reduced supersymmetry. Indeed the lowest possible
SUSY in 4d i.e N = 1 provides us with a much larger playground while still preserving some
of the simplicity that makes supersymmetry so attractive.
D3-branes on Calabi-Yau singularities
To achieve this we can consider the string
background M6 × R4 with M6 some 6-manifold and consider the low energy eﬀective theory
on a D3-brane transverse to M6. A generic M6 will break all of the supersymmetry. The
eﬀort to preserve some supersymmetry leads us to consider an M6 with a covariantly constant
spinor. This turns out to be equivalent to the requirement that M6 is Calabi-Yau i.e a Kahler
manifold with a Ricci ﬂat metric. This is in itself an elegant if elementary example of the
interplay of geometry and quantum ﬁeld theory in string theory: A salient property of QFT
(in this case supersymmetry) gets encoded in the geometry of the transverse space.
Finding the worldvolume theory on an arbitrary Calabi-Yau threefold is a formidable
task but certain subclasses of Calabi-Yau are more amenable to carrying it out. Once such
class is toric Calabi-Yau i.e Calabi-Yau that contain the algebraic torus (C∗)3 as a dense
subset. Here once again we see the interaction between geometry and quantum ﬁeld theory.
This technical sounding requirement translated to the ﬁeld theory means that it must have
U(1)3 global symmetry. Toric Calabi-Yaus are generically singular and we can place a stack
of D-branes at the singularity to probe its geometric structure (Figure 1.1).
The task of connecting the geometry to the quantum ﬁeld theory for generic toric Calabi-
Yau singularities carried out in [6] was a remarkable feat of geometric engineering. The key

Figure 1.1: A Cartoon depicting a stack D3-branes probing a Calabi-Yau singularity
insight was that the brane conﬁguration in Figure 1.1 is T-dual to another conﬁguration
dubbed brane tiling which directly encodes the resulting quantum ﬁeld theory. This con-
ﬁguration directly connects the geometry and ﬁeld theory and is another illustration of the
powerful tools string theory provides us in understanding both the geometry and physics.
Since their introduction brane tilings have found numerous other applications, among them
• They have provided an inﬁnite class of AdS/CFT duals with explicitly known matter
content and superpotential on CFT side and explicitly known metric on AdS side [7, 8].
• They are an important source of theories for string phenomenology [9, 10]
• They deﬁne a large class of integrable systems called cluster integrable systems [11–13].
• Their generalization called bipartite ﬁeld theories have found application in the study
of scattering amplitudes [5, 14]
• On mathematical side, bipartite ﬁeld theories also deﬁne an important class of com-
mutative algebras called cluster algebras or cluster varieties [15, 16].

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

Supersymmetry in Various Dimensions
Although the brane engineering of gauge the-
ories was originally studied for D3-branes, it is by no means limited to four dimensions.
Theories in 6, 4, 2 and 0-dimensions can be constructed by using D5, D3, D1 and D(−1)
branes. In all cases we are led to require that the probed geometry is a Calabi-Yau in order
to preserve some supersymmetry. The simplest case in each dimension consists of a stack
of D-branes in the ﬂat spacetime in which case the worldvolume theory is the maximally
supersymmetric gauge theory.
In all of these cases to learn about the structure of quantum ﬁeld theories and get closer
to generic QFTs we would like to study theories with as few supersymmetries as possible.
We can achieve this by using D-branes to probe general geometries. To ensure that some
supersymmetry is preserved we are lead to require that the probed geometry is a Calabi-Yau.
This setup indeed allows us to construct gauge theories with minimal supersymmetry. As a
result it has it has been extensively studied, see [17–27] for a few references.
For even dimensions the minimal supersymmetry is determined by the type of Weyl
spinors that exist. The relevant properties of Weyl spinors and the resultant supersymmetry
algebras are summarized in Table 1.1.
As shown there the conjugate of a Weyl spinors in 6 and 2 dimensions is a Weyl spinor
with the same chirality. As a result we can have independent supersymmetry in two sectors,
a fact which is reﬂected in the nomenclature for these algebras. This is not the case for four
dimensions where the conjugate of a Weyl spinor has the opposite chirality. One consequence
is that guaginos in 2 and 6 dimensions contribute to gauge anomalies while those in 4 and 0
don’t. What even this cursory look at the supersymmetry algebras makes apparent is that
they have very diﬀerent qualitative features in diﬀerent dimensions. As a result initially they
were studied one dimension at a time.
A ﬁrst detailed study of 2d (0, 2) theories on the worldvolume of D-branes probing generic
toric Calabi-Yau fourfolds was done in [28]. Subsequently the connection to the geometry

was streamlined by the introduction of brane conﬁgurations called brane brick models which
are analogues of brane tilings for Calabi-Yau fourfolds [29]. Similarly the study of gauged
matrix model on D(−1) branes was initiated in [30].
It became clear during these explorations of the interplay of geometry and quantum ﬁeld
theory that despite diﬀerent starting points the theories obtained by probing geometries in
diﬀerent dimensions themselves have a very similar structure. This structure gets shrouded
when these theories are studied one particular dimension at a time, so there is a need to ﬁnd
a uniﬁed description of these theories across dimensions that captures the similarities and
organizes the diﬀerences in a manageable form. This task required a new language.
Graded Quivers: The Language of Uniﬁcation
In [31] the authors realized that a
mathematical formalism called graded quivers ﬁts the bill for such a language perfectly. It
correctly accounts for the various multiplets that are required to build minimally supersym-
metric theories in various dimensions and moreover also encodes the requirements for the
supersymmetric interaction between these multiplets.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
6
Mutations and Dualities
But perhaps the most powerful sign that graded quivers are
the right language is that they admit an operation called mutations which maps perfectly
to the dualities of these theories. Soon after the initial study of worldvolume theories on
D3-branes it was realized that the map between quantum ﬁeld theories and geometries is not
one to one but many to one. These diﬀerent theories corresponding to the same geometry
have the same low energy limit and hence from the perspective of eﬀective theories are
diﬀerent ways of describing the same physics. It was further realized that these diﬀerent
theories are connected to each other by a generalization of an operation ﬁrst discovered by
Seiberg [20, 22, 32]. This operation done twice returns us to the original theory and was
hence dubbed Seiberg duality.
Similarly the map between 2d (0, 2) theories and Calabi-Yau fourfolds is also many to one
[33]. The biggest diﬀerence from the 4d case is that these diﬀerent theories describing the
same geometry are connected to each other by an order three operation hence it was called
triality. This operation is a generalization of equivalence of (0, 2) theories ﬁrst conjectured in
[34]. Despite having order three the operation itself is closely related to Seiberg duality (see
for example [35]). Similarly the diﬀerent theories on D(−1) branes are connected to each
other by a quadrality [30]. Graded quivers unify all these operations in the single family of
operations called mutations.
The guiding principle
The spirit behind this thesis is to continue this ongoing adventure
in geometry and physics and ﬂesh out in detail some of the features that a uniﬁed description
of these theories makes apparent. We tackle several aspects of this general correspondence,
these include:
• A uniﬁed description of the brane conﬁgurations (i.e brane tilings and their counter-
parts in other dimensions) that serve as the bridge between the geometry and the
quantum ﬁeld theory.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
7
• Determining the geometry given a quantum ﬁeld theory, or in other words determining
the moduli space of “vacua” for these supersymmetric theories.
• Methods of constructing theories corresponding to a particular geometry that utilize
this uniﬁed description to make apparent the intricate interplay between geometries
and theories across diﬀerent dimensions. If one geometry can be obtained from another
in a simple fashion that the same should be true of the corresponding ﬁeld theories too
and vice versa.
• Although we can’t construct gauge theories after we have reached 0-dimensions, graded
quivers continue to an inﬁnite family of which the gauge theories alluded to above are
the ﬁrst few instances. The physical signiﬁcance of this inﬁnite family is another prob-
lem we tackle by showing that these correspond to B-brane conﬁgurations of topological
string theory.
• Exhibit the striking power of the tools we develop by using them to describe some
inﬁnite family of geometries with dimension of the geometry increasing with each suc-
cessive member. These geometries have non-abelian global symmetries which make
the problem of describing the whole family much more tractable. Although these sym-
metries make describing the whole family easier they are in no way essential and our
tools can handle geometries without any non-abelian global symmetries.
1.1
Organization
The rest of this thesis is organized as follows: In the rest of this introductory chapter we
review the graded quivers, the language of this generalization. We also brieﬂy describe brane
tilings and brane brick models, which as alluded to above are the brane conﬁgurations that
we wish to generalize.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
8
This sets the stage for generalized dimer models which are introduced in the next chapter.
These generalize the brane tilings and brane brick models and serve as the bridge between
gauge theory and Calabi Yau geometries of arbitrary dimensions. We also introduce gen-
eralized perfect matchings. These are combinatorial objects that simplify determination of
the geometry that corresponds to a given dimer model. These ideas are illustrated with the
simplest possible example, the case when the Calabi-Yau is ﬂat space Cm+2.
As mentioned earlier ﬂat space is very far from a generic geometry, so in order to bet-
ter understand the landscape of the theories realized as generalized dimer models we need
to build a library of these models. We deal with this challenge in chapters 3, 4, 5 which
are devoted to describing some constructions which make it feasible to build dimer models
corresponding to a large class of geometries eﬃciently.
In chapter 6 we return to tackling the other direction i.e the question of determining the
geometry corresponding to a dimer model. The focus here is to use the properties of perfect
matchings to simplify their computation. The main result is an algorithm that generalizes
the Kastelyn matrix approach [6] which is well known in the case of brane tilings.
Then we move on to the realization of generalized dimer models in topological string
theory. This is the subject of chapter 7. This realization is based on the study of B-branes
on the Calabi-Yau singularities. The B-branes realize a structure known as an A∞algebra.
This structure encodes various disk correlators in topological string theory. The main focus
of this chapter is to explain the dictionary between A∞algebra and graded quivers with
superpotential. Some technical details along with a pedagogical introduction to sheaves are
relegated to Appendix A.
The next three chapters utilize all this machinery to describe in detail three inﬁnite
families of Calabi-Yau geometries. The ﬁrst of these is an orbifold of Cm+2 that preserves
all of the SU(m + 2) global symmetry of parent Cm+2. The second family is a particular

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

generalization of the well known conifold singularity. It has an SU(m+1) global symmetry1.
The last of these is a generalization of F0 and enjoys an SU(2)m+1 global symmetry. In all
these cases this large global symmetry is instrumental in the simple description of graded
quivers, perfect matchings and A∞algebras that results.
1.2
Graded quivers
Given an integer m ≥0, an m-graded quiver is a quiver equipped with a grading for every
arrow Φij by a quiver degree:
|Φij| ∈{0, 1, · · · , m} .
(1.1)
To every node i we associate a unitary “gauge group” U(Ni). Arrows stretching between
nodes correspond to bifundamental or adjoint “ﬁelds”.2
For every arrow Φij, its conjugate has the opposite orientation and degree m −|Φij|:
Φ
(m−c)
ji
≡(Φ(c)
ij ) .
(1.2)
Here we introduced a notation in which the superindex explicitly indicates the degree of the
corresponding arrow, namely |Φ(c)
ij | = c.
Since the integer m determines the possible degrees, diﬀerent values of m give rise to
qualitatively diﬀerent classes of graded quivers.
The diﬀerent types of arrows can be restricted to have degrees in the range:
Φ(c)
ij
: i −→j ,
c = 0, 1, · · · , nc −1 ,
nc ≡
m + 2
2

,
(1.3)
1Conifold corresponds to m = 1 and has another SU(2) that isn’t manifest in our formulation
2The framework of m-graded quivers can be extended to theories with gauge groups that are not unitary
and with ﬁelds that do not transform in the bifundamental or adjoint representations, i.e. theories that are
not of quiver type. We will not consider these possibilities in this paper.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
10
since other degrees can be obtained by conjugation. We refer to degree 0 ﬁelds as chiral
ﬁelds.
Polarization:
The range of degrees in (1.3) is just a conventional choice. The nc “fun-
damental” degrees can be picked diﬀerently. Sometimes it is convenient to deal with all
possible values of the degrees. For every arrow, either Φ(c)
ij or Φ
(m−c)
ji
can be regarded as the
fundamental object, while the other one is its conjugate. Such a choice of fundamental object
for every arrow in the quiver is called a polarization. As we will later see diﬀerent choices of
polarization make diﬀerent aspect of graded quiver theory clearer and we will often choose
a polarization that simpliﬁes the task at hand.
Graded quivers for m = 0, 1, 2, 3 describe d = 6, 4, 2, 0 minimally supersymmetric gauge
theories, respectively. Diﬀerent degrees map to diﬀerent types of superﬁelds. The corre-
spondence between graded quivers and gauge theories is summarized in (1.4), where we also
indicate how some of these theories can be engineered in terms of Type IIB D(5−2m)-branes
probing CY (m + 2)-folds.

Superpotential.
Graded quivers admit superpotentials, which are given by linear combi-
nations of gauge invariant terms of degree m −1:
W = W(Φ) ,
|W| = m −1 .
(1.5)
Gauge invariant terms correspond to closed oriented cycles in the quiver, which might involve
conjugation of some of the arrows. The superpotential encodes relations on the path algebra

There is no possible superpotential for m = 0. For m = 1, 2, 3, the superpotentials take
the schematic forms:
m = 1 :
W = W(Φ(0)) ,
m = 2 :
W = Φ(1)J(Φ(0)) + Φ
(1)E(Φ(0)) ,
m = 3 :
W = Φ(1)Φ(1)H(Φ(0)) + Φ(2)J(Φ(0)) ,
(1.6)
where W(Φ(0)), J(Φ(0)), E(Φ(0)) and H(Φ(0)) are holomorphic functions of the chiral ﬁelds.
Kontsevich bracket condition.
In addition to the constraint on its degree (1.5), the
superpotential must also satisfy:
{W, W} = 0 .
(1.7)
Here {f, g} denotes the Kontsevich bracket, which is a natural generalization of the Poisson
bracket to a graded quiver and is deﬁned as follows
{f, g} =

∂Φ + (−1)(|f|+1)|Φ|+(|g|+1)|Φ|+|Φ||Φ|+1 ∂f

.
(1.8)
The degree and Kontsevich bracket constraints on the superpotential are necessary for
the good behavior of a diﬀerential operator that can be associated to graded quivers. See
[2, 31] for details.
In §2 we will discuss how in the case of graded quivers related to toric CY (m + 2)-folds
the superpotential has additional structure. These extra features are at the heart of their
description in terms of generalized dimer models.

1.2.1
Mutations
Graded quivers with superpotentials enjoy order m + 1 mutations, which reproduce the
dualities of the corresponding gauge theories for m ≤3 and generalize them for m > 3.
Here we summarize the eﬀect of a mutation on a node, which we denote by ⋆[31].
1. Flavors.
As it is standard, we refer to the arrows connected to the mutated node as
ﬂavors. It is possible to take all ﬂavors as incoming into the mutated note, simply by trading
any arrow that is oriented outward for its conjugate. Once this is done, there is a natural
cyclic order for ﬂavors around the node, in which the degree of incoming arrows increases
clockwise, as shown on the left of Figure 1.2. There can be multiple or no arrows of a given
degree.

Mesons.

of composite arrows, to which we refer as mesons. For every 2-path i

j . In other words, we generate all possible
mesons involving incoming chiral ﬁelds. Sometimes, we might chose to represent the ﬁeld to
be composed with a chiral ﬁeld as an arrow that goes into the mutated node. The orientation
of both arrows, both incoming, naively seems incompatible for composition. The general rule
above is equivalent to saying that, in such cases, we use the conjugate of the incoming chiral
ﬁeld for the composition. This phenomenon, dubbed anticomposition, was ﬁrst discussed in
the physics literature in the context of quadrality of 0d N = 1 theories [30].

The remaining rules concern pre-existing terms in the superpotential. First of all, terms
that do not go through the mutated noted are not modiﬁed. The transformation of terms

Generalized anomaly cancellation

leads to the generalized anomaly cancellation conditions. They can be determined using the

where N(Φ(c)

sum over j runs over all nodes in the quiver (including i), and nc is given by (1.3). For m

For m = 0, 1, 2, 3, these conditions reproduce the cancellation of non-abelian anomalies for
the corresponding d = 6, 4, 2, 0 gauge theories with gauge group Q
i U(Ni).

Brane tilings and brane brick models
Before introducing generalized dimer models in the next chapter, we present a brief review
of brane tilings [6, 26] and brane brick models [29, 33]. These objects have been extensively
studied in the literature. The aim of this section is just to highlight some basic properties

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
17
that we will later generalize to arbitrary m.
1.3.1
Brane tilings
The 4d N = 1 gauge theories living on the worldvolume of D3-branes probing toric CY3
singularities are fully encoded by bipartite graphs on T2 denoted brane tilings [6, 26].3 In
fact a brane tiling is a physical brane conﬁguration consisting of an NS5-brane wrapping a
holomorphic curve from which D5-branes are suspended, which is related to the D3-branes
probing the CY3 by T-duality.4 The holomorphic surface is given by the zero locus of the
Newton polynomial of the toric diagram.
A simple dictionary relates brane tilings to the corresponding gauge theories. Faces, edges
and nodes in the tiling correspond to unitary gauge group factors, bifundamental or adjoint
chiral ﬁelds and superpotential terms (with sign determined by the node color), respectively.
Figure 1.8 illustrates these ideas with an explicit example. This theory is often referred to as
phase 2 of F0 [23]. The 4 gauge groups, 12 chiral ﬁelds and 8 superpotential terms are easily
read from the brane tiling. Equivalently, the same information is captured by a periodic
quiver on T2, which is obtained from the brane tiling by graph dualization. Like a brane
tiling, a periodic quiver not only summarizes the matter content and gauge symmetry of a
theory but also its superpotential, which is encoded in its minimal plaquettes. For detailed
discussions of brane tilings see e.g. [6, 36, 37] and references therein.
The gauge theories associated to toric CY3’s satisfy the so-called toric condition, namely
that every chiral ﬁeld belongs to exactly two terms in the superpotential with opposite
signs. Equivalently, every arrow in the periodic quiver belongs to two adjacent plaquettes
3Here and in the discussions that will follow for general m, we focus on toric phases of the quiver theories.
Such phases exist for any toric CY and can be deﬁned as theories that are fully captured by generalized dimers
or, equivalently, periodic quivers. Starting from them, non-toric phases can be generated by mutations.
4We refer to both the full ﬂedged brane conﬁguration and the bipartite graph representing the most
important features of its structure as brane tiling.
We will adopt a similar approach when discussing
generalized dimer models.

with opposite orientations. Brane tilings automatically implement this condition, since every
edge connects two nodes of opposite colors.
Due to the toric condition of the superpotential, all the F-terms are of the form:
∂W
∂Xi
= M +
i (Xj) −M −
i (Xj) ,
(1.12)
where M +
i and M −
i are monomials of chiral ﬁelds. To determine the moduli space, we ﬁrst
impose the vanishing of the F-terms, which become:
M +
i (Xj) = M −
i (Xj)
∀i ,
(1.13)
i.e.
for toric phases, the vanishing F-term conditions are always of the form “mono-
mial=monomial”. This property makes it possible to solve them in terms of combinatorial
objects called perfect matchings. A perfect matching p is a collection of edges in a brane
tiling such that every node is connected to exactly one edge in p.
Perfect matchings can be summarized in terms of the so-called P-matrix, whose rows and
columns are indexed by chiral ﬁelds Xi and perfect matchings pµ, respectively. It is deﬁned

(1.14)
We can think about perfect matchings as useful variables in terms of which the chiral ﬁelds
in the quiver can be expressed. In particular, the following map between perfect matching
variables and chiral ﬁelds:
Xi =
Y

pPiµ
µ
(1.15)
automatically solves the vanishing F-term equations (1.13). Hence, there is a one-to-one
correspondence between perfect matchings and GLSM ﬁelds in the toric description of the
CY3 moduli space.
Further imposing the D-term constraints, perfect matchings are mapped to points in
the corresponding 2d toric diagram. This description of the geometry can in general be
redundant, namely multiple perfect matchings can correspond to the same point in the toric
diagram. Brane tilings facilitate this process, too. Picking fundamental cycles γx and γy of
T2, equivalently the boundaries of the unit cell of the brane tiling, the Z2 coordinates of the
point in the toric diagram associated to a perfect matching pµ are then given by:
pµ →
X
i
Piµ (⟨Xi, γx⟩, ⟨Xi, γy⟩) ,
(1.16)
where ⟨Xi, γα⟩is the intersection paring between the edge Xi and the cycle γα. Diﬀerent
choices of γx and γy result in the same toric diagram up to SL(2, Z) transformations.

1.3.2
Brane brick models
Similarly, the 2d N = (0, 2) gauge theories on the worldvolume of D1-branes probing toric
CY4 singularities are fully captured by tessellations of T3 called brane brick models [29, 33].
A brane brick model is a brane conﬁguration involving an NS5-brane wrapping a holomorphic
surface Σ from which D4-branes are suspended, and it is related to the D1-branes at a CY4
via T-duality.5 Σ is the zero locus of the Newton polynomial of the CY4 toric diagram.
The gauge theory associated to a brane brick model is determined as follows. Bricks, i.e.
the 3-polytopes in the tessellation, correspond to unitary gauge group. 2d faces represent
matter ﬁelds in the bifundamental or adjoint representation of the bricks they separate.
Oriented and unoriented faces correspond to chiral and Fermi ﬁelds, respectively. Finally,
every edge represents a term in the superpotential (the m = 2 case in (1.6)), which is given
by the gauge invariant product of the chiral ﬁelds and the single Fermi ﬁeld (or its conjugate)
that meet at the edge.6
2d N = (0, 2) theories are symmetric under the exchange of any Fermi with its conjugate.
This is the symmetry between degree m/2 ﬁelds and their conjugates for even m (in this
case m = 2) discussed in §1.2.
This symmetry is accompanied by the exchange of the
corresponding J- and E-terms. The distinction between a Fermi and its conjugate, and as
a result the distinction between J- and E- terms, is therefore a matter of convention. This
symmetry is reﬂected by the fact that Fermi faces in brane brick models are unoriented.
Brane brick models are dual to periodic quivers on T3, which contain the same information.
Further details can be found in [29, 33]. Figure 1.9 shows an example of brane brick model
and periodic quiver, which correspond to local CP3 [33]. Grey and red faces correspond to
chiral and Fermi ﬁelds, respectively.
5As for brane tilings, we will interchangeably refer to the full brane conﬁguration and its “skeleton” as a
brane brick model.
6It is possible for more than one Fermi to coincide at an edge. We refer to [33] for a discussion of such
cases.

The superpotential of the 2d N = (0, 2) gauge theories associated to toric CY4’s satisfy
a toric condition [28], which in this case means that every Fermi ﬁeld belongs to exactly two
J-terms and two E-terms with opposite signs.7 The superpotential hence takes the general
form
W =
X
a
Λa(J+
a (Xi) −J−
a (Xi)) + ¯Λa(E+
a (Xi) −E−
a (Xi)) ,
(1.17)
where the sum runs over all Fermi ﬁelds Λa, and J±
a and E±
a are holomorphic monomials in
chiral ﬁelds. In brane brick models, all Fermi faces are square. This implements the toric
condition, since it implies that every Fermi ﬁelds participates in four superpotential terms,
in agreement with (1.17). Two of these terms correspond to J-terms while the two others
correspond to E-terms.
The toric CY4 arises as the classical moduli space of the gauge theory, which can be
determined in two stages. First, we impose vanishing of the chiral part of the J- and E-
terms. Due to the toric form of the superpotential (1.17), these conditions are once again of
7Here we refer to the full gauge invariant terms, i.e. including the Fermis or their conjugates, as J- and
E-terms.

the form “monomial=monomial”:
J+
a (Xi) = J−
a (Xi)
E+
a (Xi) = E−
a (Xi) ,
(1.18)
which allows us to solve them combinatorially. To do so, we introduce brick matchings,
which are the brane brick model analogues of perfect matchings [29]. A brick matching p is
a collection of chiral and Fermi ﬁelds such that:
• For every Fermi ﬁeld Λa, p contains exactly either Λa or ¯Λa.
• If p contains Λa, it contains exactly one chiral ﬁeld in each of E+
a and E−
a .
• If p contains ¯Λa, it contains exactly one chiral ﬁeld in each of J+
a and J−
a .
We can summarize the chiral ﬁeld content of brick matchings by means of the P-matrix,
deﬁned as in (1.14).8 Again, the map between chiral ﬁelds and brick matchings given by
equation (1.15) solves (1.18).
The ﬁnal step consists of imposing the vanishing of D-terms. As for brane tilings, there
is an alternative way of ﬁnding the Z3 coordinates in the toric diagram for every brick
matching. They are given by:
pµ →
X
i
Piµ (⟨Xi, γx⟩, ⟨Xi, γy⟩, ⟨Xi, γz⟩) ,
(1.19)
where γx, γy and γz are the edges of the unit cell of the brane brick model. Again, diﬀerent
choices of γα lead to the same toric diagram up to SL(3, Z) transformations.
8The P-matrix can be extended to include the Fermi ﬁeld content of brick matchings [29]. This extra
information has various applications but it is not necessary for the determination of the moduli space.

A note on notation
As can already be inferred from the preceding review, in what follows there is a tension
between notation that is most suited for describing theories across dimensions in a uniform
manner and the notation that is best suited to a particular example in a speciﬁc dimension.
This manifests itself in the notation for ﬁelds where a uniﬁed description makes it mandatory
that we are explicit about degree (i.e what kind of ﬁeld we are dealing with). On the other
hand if we are discussing a particular 4d N = 1, 2d (0, 2) or 0d N = 1 theory this not only
results in clutter but also forces us to move away from the notation that is familiar from its
extensive use in literature and can thus be alienating. Our admittedly imperfect resolution
of this tension is to make the following distinction
• If we are dealing with a theory with unspeciﬁed ‘m’ or a family of theories parametrized
by ‘m’ we explicitly indicate the degrees in the superscript.
• On the other if we are dealing with a particular m we adopt the notation commonly
used for these theories in order to better make contact with existing literature. It
means
– In the case of a 4d N = 1 theory we use use Latin letters to indicate chiral ﬁelds.
These ﬁelds have degree 0 which is not explicitly indicated.
– In the case of a 2d (0, 2) theory we use Latin letters to denote chiral ﬁelds which
have degree 0 while we use Greek letters to denote fermi ﬁelds which have degree
1. Similarly we also write J and E terms instead of directly writing the gauge
invariant superpotential.
– Lastly in the case 0d (0, 2) theories we again use Latin letters for chiral ﬁelds. An
unbarred Greek letter represents a fermi ﬁeld which has degree 2 in this case while
a conjugate fermi which has degree 1 is represented by a Greek letter with a bar

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

on top of it. We however just write the gauge invariant superpotential instead
of writing J and H terms separately as in [30]. The reason is that for H terms
that are quartic or higher order the two conjugate fermi ﬁelds may not occur
consecutively in the term which makes omitting them awkward.

Chapter 2
Generalized Dimer Models
We have reviewed brane tilings and brane brick models and discussed how they simplify the
relation between geometry and gauge theory. In this chapter we will describe an inﬁnite
generalization of them, which streamline the connection between toric CY (m + 2)-folds and
m-graded quivers.
2.0.1
Toric quivers
The CYm+2 associated to an m-graded quiver arises as its classical moduli space. Extending
the usual notion for m ≤3, it is deﬁned as the center of the Jacobian algebra with respect
to ﬁelds of degree m −1 [31]. This corresponds to imposing the relations:
∂W
∂Φ(m−1) = 0 ,
∀Φ(m−1)
(2.1)
plus gauge invariance.1
Since the superpotential has degree m −1, the terms that contribute to the relations
in (2.1) are of the general form Φ(m−1)P(Φ(0)), where P(Φ(0)) is a holomorphic function of
1For m = 2, the ﬁelds Φ(1) in (2.1) denote both Φ(1) and ¯Φ(1), namely the Fermi and conjugate Fermi
ﬁelds in the 2d N = (0, 2) gauge theory.

CHAPTER 2. GENERALZIED DIMER MODELS
26
chiral ﬁelds. We will refer to such terms as J-terms. The resulting relations (2.1) then
consist entirely of chiral ﬁelds.
The quiver theories associated to toric singularities are endowed with additional structure.
Their global symmetry contains a U(1)m+2 Cartan subgroup, coming from the isometries of
the underlying CYm+2.
Furthermore, for every toric CYm+2 there exists at least one toric phase, which is a theory
satisfying the following properties.2 First, for N regular branes and no fractional branes,
the ranks of all gauge groups are equal to N. In other words, there exists a solution to the
anomaly cancellation condition (1.10) or (1.11) in which the ranks of all gauge groups are
equal and unconstrained.
In addition, the superpotential of a toric phase obeys a toric condition, according to which
every ﬁeld of degree m −1 appears in exactly two J-terms, with opposite signs. Namely,
W = Φ(m−1)
a
J+
a (Φ(0)) −Φ(m−1)
a
J−
a (Φ(0)) + . . . ,
(2.2)
where dots indicate terms that do not contain Φ(m−1)
a
. This condition generalizes the toric
conditions for the m = 1, 2 cases discussed in §1.3.1 and §1.3.2. The relations (2.1) then
take the “monomial=monomial” form:
J+
a (Φ(0)) = J−
a (Φ(0)) .
(2.3)
This property is of central importance for the generalized dimers and the associated com-
binatorial tools that we will introduce later. A straightforward way of deriving the toric
condition is as follows. It is satisﬁed by the Cm+2 quivers as it will be explained in §3.1, it is
inherited by its Cm+2/(ZN1 × · · · × ZNm+1) orbifolds and it is preserved by partial resolution,
2Acting on this theory with sequences of mutations, we can generate other phases, both toric (if they
exist) and non-toric.

CHAPTER 2. GENERALZIED DIMER MODELS
27
with which we can reach an arbitrary toric CYm+2.
As we previously mentioned, in this paper we will exclusively focus on toric phases, so
we will no longer emphasize this distinction.
2.0.2
Generalized dimer models and periodic quivers
We are now ready to introduce generalized dimers of order m, or m-dimers for short, which
fully encode the m-graded quivers with superpotentials of toric phases associated to toric
CYm+2’s and simplify their connection to geometry.
Consider the Newton polynomial of the toric CYm+2 under consideration, which is given
by:
P(x1, . . . , xm+1) =
X
⃗v∈V
c⃗v xv1
1 . . . xvm+1
n−1 ,
(2.4)
where xµ ∈C∗, µ = 1, . . . , m+1, the c⃗v are complex coeﬃcients and the sum runs over points
⃗v in the toric diagram. By rescaling the xµ’s, it is possible to set m + 2 of the coeﬃcients to
1. The freedom in the remaining coeﬃcients captures dual phases of the quiver theory.
In addition, let us consider the coamoeba projection from (C∗)m+1 to Tm+1:
(x1, . . . , xm+1) 7→(arg(x1), . . . , arg(xm+1)) .
(2.5)
We deﬁne an m-dimer as the coamoeba projection of the holomorphic surface Σm, which
in turn is given by the zero locus of the Newton polynomial:
Σm :
P(x1, . . . , xm+1) = 0 .
(2.6)
This deﬁnition reproduces the m ≤3 cases (elliptic models, brane tilings, brane brick models
and brane hyperbrick models) and naturally generalizes them. As usual, most of the time

CHAPTER 2. GENERALZIED DIMER MODELS
28
we will focus on its tropical limit or “skeleton”, which is a tessellation of Tm+1.3
The quiver theory can be read from the m-dimer as follows. Every codimension-0 face
i, which we will denote brick, corresponds to a gauge group.
Every codimension-1 face
common to bricks i and j has an orientation and a degree c, 0 ≤c ≤m, and corresponds
to a bifundamental (or an adjoint ﬁeld if i = j) ﬁeld of degree c. As usual, we can ﬂip the
orientation by conjugation, which simultaneously changes the degree to m−c. Codimension-
2 faces are such that the degree of faces they bound sum to m−1 and map to superpotential
terms.
While determining the tessellation is relatively straightforward, establishing the orien-
tations and degrees of its codimension-1 faces is not. For m = 2, this problem has been
addressed in [39], but an algorithm for general m is still lacking. In practice, there are eﬃ-
cient alternatives for approaching this problem. One of them is obtaining the theory for the
desired geometry by partial resolution of an orbifold. Implementing such partial resolution
is considerably simpliﬁed using m-dimers.
Clearly, the structure of m-dimers is richer than what we have exploited so far.
In
particular, starting at m = 2, it is natural to ask whether faces of codimension higher than
2 have a gauge theory interpretation. It is tempting to speculate that they are connected to
the A∞relations among multi-products in the quiver algebra [2, 40]. We plan to revisit this
question in future work.
Via graph dualization, m-dimers are in one-to-one correspondence with periodic m-
quivers in Tm+1. Both objects contain exactly the same information. Periodic quivers not
only summarize the gauge symmetry and ﬁeld content.
They are such that every mini-
mal plaquette, namely the duals to codimension-2 faces of the m-dimer, corresponds to a
term in the superpotential. Table 2.1 summarizes the map between m-dimers and periodic
m-quivers.
3For this reason, these objects have been dubbed tropical coamoebas in the mathematical literature [38].

Table 2.1: Dictionary mapping m-dimers to periodic m-quivers (equivalently, toric m-quivers

It is convenient to decompose the U(1)m+2 Cartan subgroup of the global symmetry as
U(1)m+1
flavor × U(1)R. The U(1)m+1
flavor is nicely geometrized by m-dimers and periodic quivers,
where it is mapped to the fundamental directions of Tm+1.
For m ≥3, m-dimers and periodic quivers have more than three dimensions and hence
become diﬃcult to visualize. Their structure can be captured by various projections, such
as the tomography of [39, 41]. However, as we will show in this paper, several powerful tools
follow from the existence of m-dimers, equivalently from the structure of toric phases, and
do not require their explicit visualization. For simplicity, we will often phrase our discussions
in terms of periodic quivers.
2.1
Cm+2 and permutohedra
We now discuss the m-dimers associated to ﬂat space, Cm+2. These dimers can be regarded
as the simplest ones but also as the most universal, since the ones for any other toric CYm+2
can be obtained from their orbifolds, which in turn correspond to stacking multiple copies

Figure 2.1 shows the toric diagrams for m ≤3. The geometry has an SU(m + 2) isometry,
which maps to an SU(m + 2) global symmetry of the corresponding quiver theories.
2.1.1
Quiver theories
This inﬁnite family of theories was ﬁrst discussed in full generality in [2] where it was
independently derived using both the algebraic dimensional reduction procedure introduced
in [2] and the topological B-model. We quickly review it here. For m = 0, 1, 2, 3 these
theories correspond to maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills in d = 6, 4, 2, 0. For general
m, the quiver is deﬁned as follows:
• It has a single node.

the k-index totally antisymmetric representation of the global SU(m + 2) symmetry.
Then, every ﬁeld Φ(c,c+1) transforms in the antisymmetric (c + 1)-index representation
of SU(m+2). The conjugates of these ﬁelds (Φ(c,c+1)) ≡¯Φ(m−c;m+1−c) have degree m−c
and transform in the antisymmetric (m + 1 −c)-index representation of SU(m + 2).
• In the case of even m, the multiplicity of the unoriented degree-m
2 ﬁelds is half the
dimension of the corresponding representation. The full representation can be built in
terms of Φ( m
2 ) and ¯Φ( m
2 ).
Superpotential.
The superpotential terms are given by cubic terms of degree m −1
combined into SU(m + 2) invariants. In order to write the superpotential for general m, we
introduce a convention in which the products of ﬁelds include the contraction SU(m + 2)

(2.8)
where k = P
i ki is the total number of SU(m + 2) indices before contractions. Any such
term with P ki = m + 2 is manifestly SU(m + 2) invariant. The superpotential can then be
compactly written as
W =
X
i+j+k=m+2
Φ(j−1;j)Φ(k−1;k) ¯Φ(m+1−j−k;m+2−j−k) .
(2.9)
Since we sum over terms such that i + j + k = m + 2, the degrees of the ﬁelds in the
superpotential terms are given by partitions (including 0) of (m −1) into three integers.
Periodic quiver.
We now discuss how periodic quivers neatly capture the Cm+2 quivers
and their superpotentials. While visualizing periodic quivers beyond m = 2 is challenging,
they can be described fairly straightforwardly.
The periodic quiver can be embedded in the torus Tm+1 ≡Rm+1 mod (Zm+1). The unit
cell thus becomes the domain [0, 1]m+1. We locate the single node of the quiver at the origin.
Let us now consider the arrows.
There is a ﬁeld stretching from the origin to every
corner of the unit cell. Since all the corners are identiﬁed, these are adjoint ﬁelds. There
are 2m+1 −1 corners other than the origin, which is indeed the total number of ﬁelds in the
quiver.
The degree c of the ﬁeld connecting the origin to the corner with coordinates qα is given
by the L1 norm of the point minus one, i.e.:
c =
m+1
X
α=1
|qα| −1 .
(2.10)

CHAPTER 2. GENERALZIED DIMER MODELS
33
Hence, considering only ﬁelds outgoing from the origin, there are
 m+1


ﬁelds of degree c
and
  m+1

of degree m −c, whose conjugates also have degree c. If c ̸= m −c the two sets
are distinct and the total number of ﬁelds of degree c is
m + 1
c + 1

+
m + 1
c

=
m + 2
c + 1

.
(2.11)
This is precisely the dimension of the antisymmetric (c+1)-index representation of SU(m+2).
When c = m/2 the two sets coincide and the number of ﬁelds of degree c is half the dimension
of the (m/2 + 1)-index representation of SU(m + 2). In summary, this construction of the
periodic quivers nicely reproduces the quivers for Cm+2 introduced above.
Finally, it can be veriﬁed that going around any collection of three corners of the unit
cell gives rise to a minimal plaquette of degree m−1, as required. This reproduces the cubic
superpotential in (2.9).
2.1.2
m-dimers
The m-dimer for Cm+2 takes a remarkably elegant form. It consists of a tiling of Tm+1 by
a single brick, which is a permutohedron of order (m + 2), or (m + 2)-permutohedron for
short. This fact was originally noted by Futaki and Ueda in their seminal paper [41].4 The
(m+2)-permutohedron is an (m+1)-dimensional polytope embedded in (m+2)-dimensions.
The coordinates of its vertices are the permutations of the set {1, . . . , m + 2}. The number
of vertices is thus (m + 2)!, each of which is adjacent to m + 1 others. Every edge connects
two vertices that are related by exchanging two coordinates, the values of which diﬀer by
one.
More generally, the (m+2)-permutohedron has a facet for every non-empty proper subset

the corresponding quiver theory, for sharing this insight with us.

CHAPTER 2. GENERALZIED DIMER MODELS
34
of {1, . . . , m + 2}. The number of codimension-d facets is:
F(m, d) = (d + 1)! S(m + 2, d + 1) ,
(2.12)
where S(i, j) denotes the Stirling numbers of the second kind.
For example, the m-permutohedra for m = 1, 2, 3, 4 are the line segment, hexagon, trun-
cated octahedron and omnitruncated 5-cell, respectively. The ﬁrst three objects in this list
are well known from the study of elliptic models, brane tilings and brane brick models.
Let us focus on codimension-1 and 2 facets, which correspond to ﬁelds and superpotential
terms. Using (2.12), we get the table on the left of (2.13). Since for Cm+2 we have a single
brick with periodic identiﬁcations, the number of codimension-d facets must be divided
by d, giving rise the table on the right. These results are in perfect agreement with the
corresponding quiver theories. Indeed, these m-dimers are connected to the periodic quivers
discussed in the previous section by graph dualization.

CHAPTER 2. GENERALZIED DIMER MODELS

Orbifolds and higgsing.
The m-dimer for a Cm+2/(ZN1 ×· · ·×ZNm+1) orbifold is simply
given by a N1×· · ·×Nm+1 stack of (m+2)-permutohedra bricks. The action of the generators
of the orbifold group determines the periodicity conditions in Tm+1, as we will elaborate in
§3.1.
The m-dimer for an arbitrary toric CYm+2 can be obtained by starting from an orbifold
whose toric diagram contains the desired one and performing partial resolution. This pro-
cess translates into “higgsing” of the quiver which, in terms of the dimer, corresponds to
removing the codimension-1 faces associated to the chiral ﬁelds acquiring non-zero “VEVs”
and recombining the bricks accordingly. Pairs of ﬁelds might become massive in this process
and can be integrated out.
2.2
Moduli spaces and generalized perfect matchings
As discussed in section §2.0.1, the CYm+2 corresponds to the moduli space of the m-graded
quiver. The ﬁrst step in its determination is imposing the vanishing of J-terms. Due to the
toric condition (2.3), solving these equations can be accomplished combinatorially.
2.2.1
Generalized perfect matchings
We deﬁne a generalized perfect matching p of an m-dimer as a collection of ﬁelds satisfying:
1) p contains precisely one ﬁeld from each term in W.5
2) For every ﬁeld Φ in the quiver, either Φ or ¯Φ is in p.
In what follows, we will drop the unwieldy ‘generalized’ when it can be inferred from the
context and just call these objects perfect matchings.
5We note that this makes every perfect matchings gives us a polarization of the quiver. This fact will be
important in §4 and §5

CHAPTER 2. GENERALZIED DIMER MODELS
36
It is important to emphasize that while perfect matchings have a natural interpretation
in terms of m-dimers, they can be deﬁned, as we have just done, purely in terms of the
quiver theories.
Vanishing of J-terms.
Perfect matchings as deﬁned above allow us to solve (2.3) combi-
natorially. The process is essentially the same as in the case of brane tilings and brane brick
models. We encode the relation among chiral ﬁelds and perfect matchings in terms of the
P-matrix:6
Pi,µ =






if
Φ(0)
i
∈pµ
0
if
Φ(0)
i
/∈pµ
(2.14)
Using the P-matrix we deﬁne the map between perfect matchings pµ and chiral ﬁelds Φ(0)
i
as follows:
Φ(0)
i
=
Y

pPi,µ

(2.15)
With this map, the vanishing of J-terms (2.3) becomes

(2.16)
Remarkably, the deﬁnition of perfect matchings introduced above is such that these equations
are always satisﬁed. This is because for every pµ, either pµ has no chiral ﬁeld in both J+
a
and J−
a or else it has exactly one chiral ﬁeld in each of them. This is clearly the case since
the relevant terms in the superpotential are Φ(m−1)
a
(J+
a −J−
a ) and a perfect matching picks
exactly one ﬁeld from each of these two terms. Hence it either contains Φ(m−1)
a
and no chirals
from J+
a and J−, or it does not contain Φ(m−1)
a
but involves one chiral from each of J+
a and
6As we mentioned for the m = 2 case in §1.3.2, the P-matrix can be extended to include the ﬁelds
of all degrees that form a perfect matching. We expect that this extended information will be useful for
studying various structures associated to m-dimers which are yet to be discovered, but it is not necessary
for computing the moduli space.

J−.
From perfect matchings to the toric diagram.
The second step in the computation
of moduli space is to assign positions in the integer lattice Zm+1 to the perfect matchings,
in order to construct the toric diagram of the CYm+2. We can do so by a straightforward
generalization of the procedure we previously outlined for brane tilings and brane brick
models. We pick fundamental cycles γα, α = 1, . . . , m + 1, of the torus Tm+1 in which the
m-dimer is embedded. Since chiral ﬁelds are oriented codimension-1, faces we can deﬁne the
intersection pairing between the chiral ﬁelds and the fundamental cycles:

Recall that degree-m ﬁelds should be regarded as conjugate chirals.
The position of a perfect matching in the toric diagram is then given by:

(2.18)
Alternative choices of γα give rise to the same toric diagram up to SL(m + 1, Z) transfor-
mations.
m = 1, 2 case
Let us verify that for m = 1, 2 generalized perfect matchings indeed reduce to ordinary
perfect matchings and brick matchings, respectively.
Ordinary perfect matchings.
For m = 1, only chiral ﬁelds appear in the superpotential
due to holomorphy and an ordinary perfect matching p is deﬁned by the ﬁrst of the conditions

CHAPTER 2. GENERALZIED DIMER MODELS
38
above. The second condition can be implemented by simply adding to p the conjugates
of the rest of the ﬁelds, since the conjugates do not appear in any superpotential term.
Therefore, ordinary perfect matchings are in one-to-one correspondence with generalized
perfect matchings.
Brick matchings.
For m = 2, a brick matching p is obtained by requiring the ﬁrst con-
dition but the second condition is imposed only for Fermis. Again, since the superpotential
does not contain conjugate chiral ﬁelds, we can uniquely extend a brick matching to a gen-
eralized perfect matching by adding the conjugates of all the chiral ﬁelds which are not in
p.
The m = 0 case
Although we motivated m-dimers by discussing brane tilings (m = 1) and brane brick
models (m = 2), the natural starting point is m = 0. This case corresponds to 6d N = (1, 0)
supersymmetric gauge theories on the worldvolume of D5-branes probing toric CY 2-folds.
The only toric CY 2-folds are C2 and its orbifolds C2/Zn, whose toric diagrams are given
by the integer points 0, . . . , n. The quiver for C2/Zn is an n-node necklace quiver, namely
the aﬃne Dynkin diagram ˜An.
Let us now discuss the perfect matchings and how they give rise to the toric diagrams.
For m = 0, all the matter ﬁelds and their conjugates have degree 0 so the ﬁelds or edges in
the periodic quiver are unoriented. There is no superpotential, since it should have degree
m −1 = −1. This implies that the ﬁrst condition in the deﬁnition of perfect matchings is
trivially satisﬁed. A perfect matching then corresponds to assigning an orientation to each
of the of n edges of the quiver to satisfy the second condition. For the toric diagram, we
assign +1 and 0 contributions to the x coordinate to the edges with right and left orientation,
respectively. We obtain the toric diagram of C2/Zn, as expected.

CHAPTER 2. GENERALZIED DIMER MODELS

2.2.2
Chiral ﬁelds and generalized perfect matchings
Remarkably, the full ﬁeld content of a perfect matching can be reconstructed from the
knowledge of the chiral ﬁelds in it.
Let us suppose that {Φ(0)
i } is the set of chiral ﬁelds in a perfect matching p. The only
terms in which ﬁelds of degree m −1 participate are the J-terms Φ(m−1)
a
Ja(Φ(0)
i ). The chiral
ﬁelds in p cover a subset of the J-terms so p must contain all the Φ(m−1)
a
that appear in the
rest of the terms. In order to satisfy the second condition, we include the conjugate of the
remaining degree m −1 ﬁelds ¯Φ(1)
a , which determines all the ﬁeld of degree 1 in p.
Continuing this process recursively, we can compute the full perfect matching. For every
1 ≤k ≤⌊m
2 ⌋, the terms in which a ﬁeld Φ(m−k)
a
appear have the form Φ(m−k)
a
P (k−1)
a
, where
P (k−1) is a polynomial of degree k −1 and hence only involves ﬁelds of degree c ≤k −1.
The ﬁelds in p of degree c ≤k −1 cover a subset of the superpotential terms and we must
add the Φ(m−k)
a
appearing in the remaining ones. We will assume that every ﬁeld appears in
at least one term in the superpotential, so this unambiguously determines whether it is in
p or not. Once we establish the ﬁelds of degree m −k in p, we must add conjugates of the
remaining ones, which are the ﬁelds of degree k in p. At the end of this process we will have
computed all the ﬁelds in p from the knowledge of the chiral ﬁelds in it.
2.2.3
Perfect matchings for Cm+2
Let us illustrate the previous ideas, using perfect matchings to verify that the theories
presented in §2.1 indeed correspond to Cm+2.
In order to construct the perfect matchings, it is convenient to exploit the SU(m + 2)
global symmetry. Picking a direction µ = 1, . . . , m + 2 breaks SU(m + 2) →SU(m + 1).
Under this symmetry breaking, the quiver ﬁelds Φ(j−1;j), 1 ≤j ≤

CHAPTER 2. GENERALZIED DIMER MODELS

follows:7
Φ(j−1;j) →Φ(j−1;j;µ) + Φ(j−1;j;µ) ,
(2.19)
where Φ(j−1;j;µ) and Φ(j−1;j;µ) have j −1 and j indices, respectively, and are explicitly given
by:
(Φ(j−1;j;µ))ν1···νj−1
=
(Φ(j−1;j))µν1···νj−1 ,
(Φ(j−1;j;µ))ν1···νj
=
(Φ(j−1;j))ν1···νj .
(2.20)
Making only the reduced SU(m + 1) symmetry manifest, the superpotential (2.9) takes the
form:
W ∼
P
i+j+k=m+2 Φ(j−1;j;µ)Φ(k−1;k;µ) ¯Φ(m+1−j−k;m+2−j−k;µ)
+

+
P
i+j+k=m+2 Φ(j−1;j;µ)Φ(k−1;k;µ) ¯Φ(m+1−j−k;m+2−j−k;µ) .
(2.21)
It becomes clear that there are m+2 perfect matchings, one for each value of µ. Furthermore,
all Φ(j−1;j;µ) and ¯Φ(j−1;j;µ) form a perfect matching i.e.
pµ = {Φ(j−1;j;µ), ¯Φ(j−1;j;µ)|1 ≤j ≤m
2 + 1} .
(2.22)
In particular, the chiral ﬁeld content consists of a single chiral ﬁeld:
pµ|chiral = {Φ(0;1;µ)} ,
(2.23)
i.e. there is a one-to-one correspondence between chiral ﬁelds and perfect matchings.
We can choose the fundamental cycles of Tm+1 such that

Φ(0;1;µ), γα

= δα,µ ,
(2.24)
7We have chosen to denote the degree of ﬁelds by j −1 for later convenience.

CHAPTER 2. GENERALZIED DIMER MODELS
41
with α = 1, . . . , m+1. In particular, this implies that

Φ(0;1;m+2), γα

= 0. The toric diagram
therefore consists of the points:
v0 = (0, . . . , 0) ,
v1 = (1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) ,
v2 = (0, 1, 0, . . . , 0) ,
. . . ,
vm+1 = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1) ,
(2.25)
which is indeed the toric diagram of Cm+2.

Chapter 3
Constructing Dimer Models I:
Orbifolds and Partial Resolution
In the last section we deﬁned generalized dimer models and described how they elegantly
unify the geometry and quantum ﬁeld thoery. Now we turn to the question of how to actually
construct these dimer models. We start by constructing the graded quivers corresponding
to the abelian orbifolds of Cm+2. The toric diagrams of these orbifolds are simplices.
An arbitrary toric diagram can be reached by embedding it in a simplex and then re-
moving some of the points. The periodic quiver corresponding to this toric diagram can
be connected to that of parent theory by partial resolution which we describe next. Our
description of both orbifolding and partial resolution are a generalization of these operations
for the well-known cases of m = 1 and m = 2 to arbitrary m.
3.1
Orbifolds of Cm+2
Orbifolds of Cm+2 constitute a large class of Calabi-Yau singularities, which are obtained by
orbifolding a discrete subgroup G of the SU(m + 2) isometry of ﬂat space. We will focus
42

CHAPTER 3.
ORBIFOLDS AND PARTIAL RESOLUTION
43
on abelian orbifolds, i.e. those for which the subgroup G is abelian. The purpose of this
section is twofold. First, we will initiate the study of general abelian orbifolds of Cm+2. The
literature contains some interesting classiﬁcation of the corresponding toric diagrams up to
relatively large m [42–44], but there is no study of the associated m-graded quivers, a gap
that we now ﬁll.
An abelian subgroup of SU(m + 2) can be decomposed as:
G ∼= Zk1 × Zk2 × · · · × Zkm+1 .
(3.1)
Quiver and orbifold action.
The quivers contain |G| nodes, which are indexed by ele-
ments of G. The action of G on Cm+2 is stipulated by specifying m + 1 elements gα ∈G,
which are required to generate G.1 We deﬁne:
gm+2 = −
m+1
X
α=1
gα .
(3.2)
We now discuss the matter content of the quiver, starting with the chiral ﬁelds. Fields
of higher degree follow an analogous discussion. There are (m + 2)|G| chiral ﬁelds. We can
think about each of them as arising from an element g ∈G and a chiral ﬁeld in Cm+2 theory
as follows:
(g, Φ(0;µ)) →Φ(0;µ)
g,g+gµ ,
(3.3)
with µ = 1, · · · , m + 2.
The chiral ﬁelds in the unorbifolded Cm+2 quiver theory transform in the fundamental
representation of SU(m+2). An orbifold gauges a discrete subgroup G of the global symme-
try of its parent theory. This means that generically there is no non-abelian global symmetry
1At this point it is worth emphasizing some standard facts. First, we note that the decomposition of
the orbifold group G into cyclic groups as in (3.1) is not unique. Moreover, there can be multiple diﬀerent
orbifolds for the same cyclic groups. Fully specifying the orbifold under consideration requires determining
a set of generators. Finally, given an orbifold, the generators can be picked in diﬀerent ways.

CHAPTER 3.
ORBIFOLDS AND PARTIAL RESOLUTION

left. It is for this reason that in (3.3) we explicitly wrote the index µ of the parent ﬁeld and
omitted the 1 that indicates the fundamental representation. Similarly, the arrows of degree
k are given by
(g, Φ(k;µ1···µk+1)) →Φ(k;µ1···µk+1)
g,g+gµ1+···+gµk+1 .
(3.4)
As before, we have written the k+1 indices of the corresponding antisymmetric representation
of SU(m + 2) in which the degree k arrows in Cm+2 transform.
Periodic quiver and superpotential.
The periodic quiver of an orbifold theory is ob-
tained by enlarging the fundamental domain of the Cm+2 quiver. This enlargement is de-
scribed by m + 1 linearly independent points vα in the integer lattice. The vα are deﬁned up
to SL(m + 1, Z) transformations, which preserve the underlying torus. It is always possible
to use SL(m + 1, Z) to take the vα to triangular form, i.e. such that:
(vα)β = 0
for β > α .
(3.5)
The orbifold group (3.1) and its action can be determined from such a triangular vα. Let
uα be the ﬁrst non-zero integer point on the segment connecting the origin to vα. Then:
vα = kαuα ,
(3.6)
ﬁxes the integers kα in (3.1).
Every integer point in the enlarged torus can be written as hαuα with hα ∈Zkα. So
h ≡(h1, · · · , hm+1) is an element of G and labels the node of the periodic quiver that is

CHAPTER 3.

located at this point. In particular this is true for the m + 1 unit vectors:
(1, 0, · · · , 0) ,
(0, 1, 0 · · · , 0) ,
· · ·
,
(0, · · · , 0, 1) .
(3.7)
The elements gα ∈G labeling these m + 1 points are the generators deﬁning the orbifold
action.
We have explained how to locate the nodes on the Tm+1 torus. Connecting them with the
ﬁelds in (3.4), we complete the periodic quiver. The superpotential consists of the minimal
plaquettes in it. They are all cubic and we can explicitly write the superpotential, which is
given by:
W =
X
g∈G

i+j+k=m+2
ϵµ1···µm+2Φ
(j−1;µ1···µj)

g+g(µ;j+k),g
,
(3.8)
where we deﬁned:
g(µ, j) =
j
X
α=1
gµα .
(3.9)
The previous discussion can be immediately translated into an algorithm for the con-
struction of the m-dimer for general abelian orbifolds of Cm+2, which corresponds to the
appropriate stacking of |G| copies of the (m + 2)-permutohedron.
From the orbifold action to the periodic quiver.
Having explained how a given
enlargement of the fundamental domain of the periodic quiver translates into the orbifold
action, we now discuss the inverse problem. As previously mentioned, the decomposition
of the orbifold group into cyclic groups is not unique. The important point is the relation
among the generators and we can choose a decomposition that simpliﬁes them. For this
purpose, we take Zk1 to be the cyclic group generated by g1 and hence g1 to be (1, 0, · · · , 0).
Next, we take Zk1 ×Zk2 to be the group generated by g1 and g2 so that g2 = (g2,1, 1, 0, · · · , 0).

CHAPTER 3.
ORBIFOLDS AND PARTIAL RESOLUTION
46
Continuing with this process, we can choose Zk1 × · · · × Zkα to be the group generated by
g1, · · · , gα, so that:
gα = (gα,1, gα,2, · · · , gα,α−1, 1, 0, · · · , 0)
for all 1 ≤α ≤m + 1 .
(3.10)
This presentation of gα makes it clear how to enlarge the fundamental domain of the periodic
quiver of Cm+2 to construct the periodic quiver for the action gα. The vectors vα which result
in this action are
v1 = k1(1, 0, 0, · · · , 0)
v2 = k2(−g2,1, 1, 0, · · · , 0)
v3 = k3(−g3,1 + g3,2g2,1, −g3,2, 1, 0, · · · , 0)

An Example: An inﬁnite family Cm+2/Zm+2
Orbifolding generically breaks the SU(m+
2) global symmetry of the parent Cm+2 theory. To preserve the global symmetry we need
to have gµ = 1 for all µ. Since gµ is determined as in (3.2), this is possible only when the
orbifold group has only one non-trivial factor Zk. Moreover k must divide m + 2. The only
two choices that are independent of m are then k = 1 which results in the trivial orbifold
Cm+2 or k = m + 2. The latter family of Cm+2/Zm+2 theories will be described in detail in
§8.
Perfect Matchings
The superpotential (3.8) in principal allows us to determine the per-
fect matchings and consquently moduli space of orbifold theories. But with just the deﬁnition
of perfect matchings in hand such a computation is going to be cumbersome and in general

intractable. So we leave an investigation of the combinatoric structure of perfect matchings
to a later place (see §6.5) when we have developed more tools to carry out such a task.
3.2
Partial Resolution
Although orbifolds constitute a large class of well-studied geometries, they have many prop-
erties that are not representative of generic toric Calabi-Yau. The most obvious of these is
the superpotential which is entirely cubic for orbifolds but that is not true generic toric CY
singularities. Partial resolution is an operation that connects orbifolds to generic singular-
ities. The connection stems from the observation that any toric diagram can be embedded
in a large enough simplex i.e the toric diagram of an orbifold.
Partial resolution is an algorithm that allows us to start with a dimer model with toric
diagram TCYm+2 and systematically construct any dimer model whose toric diagram TCY ′
m+2
is contained in TCYm+2 by removing the points in TCYm+2 that are not in TCY ′
m+2.

chiral ﬁeld acquiring VEV is shown in green.
3.2.1
Higgsing
On the gauge theory side partial resolution is achieved via higgsing, so we start with explain-
ing the eﬀect of turning on non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) for a bifundamental
chiral ﬁeld Φ(0)
ij . For the case of m ≤3 where we have a gauge theory interpretation this
means that the gauge groups which Φ(0)
ij connects i.e i and j and higgsed to their diagonal
subgroup. The antidiagonal subgroup becomes massive and drops out.
The result is that Φ(0)
ij is removed from the periodic quiver while the nodes i and j are
joined into a single subgroup. This process is depicted schematically in Figure 3.2. This
operation on periodic quiver makes sense even for m ≥3 and we will continue to refer to
it as higgsing. As a result of higgsing the superpotential changes too. The ﬁeld Φ(0)
ij
gets
replaced by its VEV. This process changes the superpotential too as we replace Φ(0)
ij by its
expectation value. As always in this thesis we will set the expectation value to 1 for the sake
of simplicity.
3.2.2
Integrating out the massive ﬁelds
This change in superpotential may make some pair of ﬁelds massive. These mass terms can
be integrated out as we now explain.

CHAPTER 3.

49
A mass term in superpotential W takes the form
Φ(c)
ij Ψ(m−1−c)

∂W
∂Ψ(m−1−c)
ji

∂W
∂Φ(c)

(3.13)
The superpotential can be expanded as
W = Φ(c)
ij Ψ(m−1−c)
ji
−P (c)Ψ(m−1−c)
ji
−Φ(c)
ij Q(m−1−c) + · · ·
(3.14)
Where P (c) and Q(m−1−c) are polynomials in quiver ﬁelds of degree c and m−1−c respectively
and the ellipsis indicates the terms that are independent of Φ(c)
ij and Ψ(m−1−c)
ji
. Hence the
equations of motion for Φ(c)
ij and Ψ(m−1−c)
ji
are
Φ(c)
ij = P (c)
Ψ(m−1−c)
ji
= Q(m−1−c)
(3.15)
The superpotential after integrating out the massive ﬁelds is then
˜W = W

(3.16)
i.e we replace the massive ﬁelds with their equations of motion and set their conjugates to
0. It is straightforward to see that it is not necessary to replace both ﬁelds by their equation

All three deﬁnitions of ˜W we have written give exactly the same result.
3.2.3
Partial resolution via higgsing
After this preamble we are ready to explain how the process of removing points from TCY m+2
can be achieved via higgsing on the gauge theory side. To describe how the process of giving
expectation values changes the toric diagram we recall that the relation between perfect
matchings and chiral ﬁelds is encoded by the P matrix Pi,µ deﬁned in (1.14). Giving a
non-zero VEV to a chiral ﬁeld Φ(0)
i
removes all the perfect matchings pµ such that Pi,µ = 1.
In other words giving VEV to a chiral ﬁeld removes all the perfect matchings to which it
contributes. This is because the terms in the superpotential covered by Φ(0)
i
in such a perfect
matching pµ are no longer covered by any ﬁeld in pµ after we replace Φ(0)
i
by its VEV.
Since each perfect matching corresponds to a point in the toric diagram, this reduces the
multiplicity of perfect matchings at the points in the toric diagram to which pµ belongs. A
point in the toric diagram can be removed by giving expectation values to enough ﬁelds such
that none of the perfect matchings corresponding to it survive.
As a result we can determine the set of ﬁelds needed to remove the points from TCYm+2
that are not in the TCY ′
m+2 by looking at the P-matrix for dimer model corresponding to
CYm+2. Both the embedding of TCY ′
m+2 inside TCYm+2 as well the choice of chiral ﬁelds we
need to give VEV to for a given embedding are not necessarily unique. Diﬀerent choices can
lead to diﬀerent phases of same theory.

CHAPTER 3.
ORBIFOLDS AND PARTIAL RESOLUTION
51
The structure of perfect matchings is such that the toric diagram is always a convex
polytope. As a result it is not possible to remove points which are not the corners of the
toric diagram without removing the corners needed to make the resulting toric diagram
convex.
3.2.4
Toric condition and partial resolution
The dimer models are required to satisfy a toric condition whereby every degree m −1 ﬁeld
Φ(m−1)
ij
takes part in exactly two terms in the superpotential with opposite signs. We show
in this section that it is preserved by partial resolution. Moreover we argue that it is the
only such condition that can be expected to hold.
Notice that the giving VEV to a chiral itself doesn’t change the number of terms in
superpotential at all so the toric condition is preserved. The non-trivial changes to number
of terms occur when we integrate out the ﬁelds that becomes massive as a result of this
VEV.
Any term involving Φ(m−1)
ij
is of the form Φ(m−1)
ij
J(0)
ji with J(0) a monomial of chiral ﬁelds.
As a result the massive pairs relevant to these terms are those that involve a chiral Φ(0)
ij and
ﬁeld Ψ(m−1)
ji
of degree m −1. For a toric quiver Ψ(m−1)
ji
takes part in exactly two terms with
opposite signs i.e2

Where M (0)
ij
is a monomial of chiral ﬁelds. The equation of motion we need is then Φ(0)
ij =
M (0)
ij . Since M (0)
ij
is a monomial with positive sign, it doesn’t aﬀect the number of terms
or the sign of terms with ﬁeld of degree m −1 in them. Hence the toric condition is still
satisﬁed after we plug in the equation of motion.
2The sign in the equation is the sign with which the mass term occurred and doesn’t aﬀect the equation
of motion.

CHAPTER 3.
ORBIFOLDS AND PARTIAL RESOLUTION
52
This will not be the case if the ﬁeld being integrated out is replaced by a polynomial with
more than one term. This happens when we we give VEVs to chiral ﬁelds in orbifolds of
Cm+2. Along with massive pairs involving chiral ﬁelds, this also gives rise to massive ﬁelds
of degree c with 0 < c < m −1. The equations of motion in such case equate the massive
ﬁeld to a polynomial and a result the number of terms in which a given ﬁeld of degree less
than m −1 takes part can change.
3.2.5
Examples
Like orbifolding we restrict ourselves to explaining the general principles behind partial
resolution and leave the task of providing examples for to a later stage, when we construct
some inﬁnite families of dimer models. It is utilized in §9.1, §9.3 and §10.5. We refer the
reader to those sections for examples.

Chapter 4
Constructing Dimer Models II:
Printing
Let’s recall that the toric diagram of a toric Calabi-Yau m+2 fold Xm is an m+1-dimensional
convex lattice polytope. Each point in the toric diagramam corresponds to (a collection of)
perfect matching(s). One obvious method of constructing a Calabi-Yau m + 3-fold Xm+1
starting from Xm+2 is take the toric diagramam of Xm+1 and embed it into m+2 dimensional
lattice such that a point v in it gets mapped to
v →(v, 0)
(4.1)
Then we can turn this into the toric diagram of a Calabi-Yau m + 3-fold by simultaneously
taking several point of this toric diagram and placing a number of copies of these points up
to an arbitrary height (or depth) from the central plane which contains the toric diagram of
Xm+1. As a result if the toric diagram of Xm contains points vi then the toric diagram of
53

CHAPTER 4. PRINTING OF DIMER MODELS
54
Xm+1 is the convex hull of points
(vi, 0)
and
(vi, hi)
(4.2)
Where hi is the height to which vi has been “lifted”. It is important to notice that the
points inside the convex hull of the points that are automatically lifted to generate a Calabi-
Yau and we only need to lift the minimum of points required to construct the desired toric
diagram. Figure 4.1 shows an example of this process that starts from the toric diagram of
the complex cone over dP3 and lifts two points. The blue and green points give rise to two
and three points, respectively.
Figure 4.1: Example of lift of two points in the toric diagram of the complex cone over dP3.
Printing is a process that implements this process on the gauge theory (i.e. m-dimer)
side. We will start with the m-dimer (or equivalently periodic quiver) associated with Xm
and use it to construct the m-dimer corresponding to Xm+1 thus realizing the connection
between the two geometries. This makes it a powerful tool for studying the corresponding
brane conﬁgurations and gauge theories capable of realizing a large class of geometries.
Even after this preliminary introduction, it becomes clear that a given CYm+3 can be
reached by starting from diﬀerent CYm+2’s. Figure 4.2 shows an example, in which the
so-called D3 geometry [28] is obtained from C3 and the conifold. In order to simplify the
comparison, we placed the toric diagram of C3 on the x −z plane and lifted it along the

CHAPTER 4. PRINTING OF DIMER MODELS
55
y-axis. We refer the reader to [1] for a detailed study of this example.
Figure 4.2: The D3 toric diagram can be reached by lifting three points in C3 or two points
in the conifold.
4.1
Printing of Periodic Quivers
In this section we discuss the action of printing on the gauge theory. Printing can be regarded
as a procedure for generating m+1-dimers from m-dimers. In practice, it is more convenient
to formulate it in terms of the dual periodic quivers, going from a quiver on Tm+1 to one on
Tm+2.1 The ﬁrst two instances of this are
• For m = 0 this process starts with the periodic quiver on T1 for 6d N = (0, 1) elliptic
model and constructs the periodic quiver on T2 for a 4d N = 1 theory.
• For m = 1 this starts with the periodic quiver for a 4d N = 1 theory and constructs
one on T3 for a 2d N = (0, 2) theory.
1More generally, as we mention below, it might be possible to use multiple quivers related by mutations,
and hence associated to the same underlying CYm+2, as building blocks.

CHAPTER 4. PRINTING OF DIMER MODELS
56
4.1.1
Quiver Blocks
The elementary building block for printing is a quiver Qp on Tm+1 × I, with I a line interval
along the vertical direction. Here Q is the periodic quiver on Tm+1 corresponding to an
m-dimer associated to a toric CYm+2 and p is a perfect matching of Q. We refer to these
objects as quiver blocks. Qp is constructed from Q and p by a process that closely resembles
algebraic dimensional reduction [31] the details of which are as follows:
• On each of the two boundary Tm+1’s, place a copy of Q but increase the degree of
ﬁelds in p by 1. The degrees of ﬁeld not in p (i.e the conjugates of ﬁelds in p) remain
unchanged. With these assignments of degrees, these ﬁeld become arrows in m + 1-
graded quivers and are to be understood as such.
• Label the two copies of every gauge group (or node) i in Q as i and i, depending on
which boundary of the quiver block they live on.
• For every ﬁeld X (c)
ij
in Q that is not in p, add a ﬁeld X(c+1)
i,j
.
• For every gauge group i of Q add a chiral ﬁeld X(0)
i,i .
For clarity, here and in what follows, we use X to refer to ﬁelds in m-dimer and X for ﬁelds
of m + 1 dimer or quiver block.
In summary every gauge group i of Q gives rise to two descendant gauge groups i and
i on the two boundaries of the quiver block. In addition it gives rise to a chiral ﬁeld Xi,i
which interpolates between the two boundaries.
Similarly a ﬁeld X (c)
i,j that is not in p gives rise to three descents. Two of these i.e X(c)
i,j
and X(c)
i,j live on the two boundaries of quiver block Qp and have the same degree c as X (c)
i,j .
The third descendant X(c+1)
i,j
interpolates between two boundaries and its degree is one more
than that of X (c)
i,j . By deﬁnition the conjugate ¯
X (m−c)
j,i
of X (c)
i,j is in p. It also gives rise to

Figure 4.3 shows an example of quiver block starting with m = 0 theory i.e Cm+2/Zm+2.
Figure 4.4 shows a couple of m = 1 examples of quiver blocks for C3 and the conifold. For
examples in this section we will restrict ourselves to m = 0 and m = 1 since in these cases
there is a graphical representation which makes the process clear2. When representing m = 2
i.e 2d (0, 2) quivers, every node corresponds to a U(Ni) gauge group, black arrows correspond
to chiral ﬁelds and red lines correspond to Fermi ﬁelds. Fermi lines are unoriented due to
the Λa ↔Λa3 symmetry of 2d (0, 2) theories.
The construction itself works for arbitrary m and in fact we will use it in §9 to construct
some theories for higher m.
4.1.2
Building the Vertical Dimension of the Periodic Quiver
We include one quiver block Qp for every image of the point TCYm+2 associated to p that we
want to generate. In order to give rise to an image along the positive direction, the quiver
block must be oriented as in the examples in Figure 4.4, namely with the i nodes at the
top and the i nodes at the bottom. We refer to such a conﬁguration as a (+) quiver block.
2In the explicit examples that follow, identifying the perfect matching used for constructing each quiver
block is straightforward. For m = 0 it corresponds to the orientation of arrows on the boundary. For m = 1
it simply corresponds to the Fermi ﬁelds on the T2 boundaries.
3In these examples we will also use the standard notation for (0, 2) theories in which chiral ﬁelds are
represented by Roman letters and fermi ﬁelds by Greek letters and drop the degrees to make the notation
cleaner.

Conversely, to generate an image in the negative direction, we ﬂip the vertical orientation of
the quiver block, putting the i layer on top of the i one. We call this a (−) quiver block.
It is well known that, generically, multiple perfect matching can correspond to the same
point in a TCY3. Thus, quiver blocks for diﬀerent perfect matchings can be simultaneously
used to generate various images along the vertical direction of the same point in the original
toric diagram.
In what follows, we will restrict to quiver blocks coming from a single periodic quiver
Q. It would be interesting to determine if, and if so under what conditions, it is possible
to combine quiver blocks associated to diﬀerent quivers related by mutations. We leave this
question for future investigation.
The quiver blocks are stacked along the vertical direction and glued along their bound-
aries. The ﬁrst and last boundaries are also identiﬁed to turn vertical direction into a T1 i.e
circle. This process generates the periodic quiver on Tm+2 associated to the desired CYm+3
as follows:
• Identify overlapping nodes.
• Identify overlapping pairs of ﬁelds with the same degree.
• If two overlapping ﬁelds don’t have the same degree then their degrees diﬀer by 1.

CHAPTER 4. PRINTING OF DIMER MODELS
59
Delete such pairs, since they correspond to massive pairs of ﬁelds.
The order in which the quiver blocks are stacked along the vertical direction is arbitrary.
Generically, each ordering gives rise to a diﬀerent periodic quiver, i.e. a diﬀerent dimer
model, associated to the same CYm+3. All such theories are conjectured to be related by
a sequence of mutations. An extremely rich combinatorics arises as a result of both the
ordering and the freedom in choosing diﬀerent sets of perfect matchings for lifting the same
points in the toric diagram. This freedom was studied in [45] in the far more restricted
context of orbifold reduction of 2d (0, 2) theories, which uses a single perfect matching and
where the only freedom is the relative ordering of the (+) and (−) quiver blocks.
Figure 4.5 is a schematic illustration of two possible orderings in an example involving
two perfect matchings p and q. Let us denote kp,± and kq,± the numbers of quiver blocks
with a given sign for each of these perfect matchings. In this case, kp,+ = 3 and kp,−= 1
and the corresponding quiver blocks are represented by blue boxes. Similarly, kq,+ = 1 and
kq,−= 1 and its quiver blocks are shown in green. If p and q come from diﬀerent points in
TCYm+2, p would generate three new points in the positive vertical direction and one point in
the negative vertical direction. Similarly, q would give rise to one point above the plane and
one point below the plane. If, instead, p and q correspond to the same point in the original
toric diagram, this conﬁguration would generate kp,+ + kq,+ = 4 points over the original
point and kp,−+kq,−= 2 below it. In §4.3 we will explain that, in order to generate reduced,
i.e. consistent, brane brick models we can at most use two diﬀerent perfect matchings for a
single point and the corresponding quiver blocks must have diﬀerent signs.
4.1.3
Anomaly Cancellation
In this section we show that theories constructed via printing satisfy the anomaly cancellation
conditions (1.10) and (1.11). This means that for m = 1, 2, 3 the corresponding theories on

D3, D1 and D(−1) branes have no non-abelian gauge anomalies4
Printing produces toric phases of geometries i.e phases in which the ranks of all gauge
groups are equal, namely Ni = N. For m = 0, 1, 2 these arises when a CYm+2 is probed
with a stack of N regular D(6-2m)-branes. In this case the anomaly cancellation conditions
become

We are now ready to prove the cancellation of non-abelian anomalies in printed theories.
Consider an arbitrary quiver block Qp. In order to keep track of anomalies, it is convenient
to assign ﬁelds that lie on a boundary Tm+1 a weight w equal to 1
2(−1)k with k the degree
of this ﬁeld. We introduce semi-integer weights in order to split the contributions of such
ﬁelds to the anomaly between adjacent quiver blocks. Similarly, we assign (−1)k to a ﬁeld
of degree k in the bulk of the quiver block. Figure 4.6 shows that the descendants of an
incoming chiral ﬁeld X (k)
ji
contribute a net weight of 1
2(−1)k to i and 1
2(−1)k at i.
At this point we divide into two cases depending on whether the ‘m’ of parent quiver Q
4Theories on D1-branes at singularities might have non-vanishing abelian gauge anomalies. We expect
they are canceled via interactions with bulk RR ﬁelds, as shown in [46] for orbifolds of C4.

is odd or even.
Odd m
In this case the parent quiver satisﬁes (4.3) with even m. Let us consider the node
i of the m + 1 graded quiver block. Each ﬁeld of degree k in Q incoming at i contributes
(−1)k/2.
This is just its contribution to to anomaly cancellation at i scaled by a 1/2.
Therefore (4.3) means that the sum of all these contributions vanishes. Therefore, the only
non-vanishing contribution to the net weight comes from (m + 1) graded chiral ﬁeld X(0)
i,i .
So denoting by Fi the set of all (m + 1)-graded ﬁelds charged under the gauge group i, we
have
X
s∈Fi
ws = 1 ,
(4.4)
for every node i. A similar argument shows that the same equation is satisﬁed by all i nodes.
Next, let us consider what happens when gluing two quiver blocks Qp and Qq along their

CHAPTER 4. PRINTING OF DIMER MODELS
62
boundaries. Then, a node a on the boundary of Qp becomes identiﬁed with a node b on the
boundary of Qq. Summing the contributions of the form (4.4) for a and b, we obtain
X

s∈Fb
ws = 2 .
(4.5)
This equation is independent of the relative orientation in the vertical direction of the two
quiver blocks, i.e. its valid for (+, +), (−, −) and (+, −) pairs.
The weights in the previous discussion precisely give rise to the contribution to anoma-
lies of all ﬁelds. In particular, whenever two ﬁelds of the same degree overlap on a glued
boundary, we obtain the corresponding integer contribution. Similarly, the contribution of
an overlapping pair with degrees diﬀering by 1 is zero, as expected. Equation (4.5) is thus
equivalent to the anomaly cancellation condition (4.3) for all nodes in the quiver.
Even m
The case when m is odd proceeds along the same lines. The diﬀerence is that the
parent quiver satisﬁes (4.3) with odd m. After taking into account the factor of 1/2 from
Figure 4.6, this means that contribution of all ﬁelds incoming at i which descend from ﬁelds
in Q adds up to 1. The only other contribution is from X(0)
i,i . The ﬁeld incoming at i is the
conjugate of this ﬁeld and provides a contribution of −1. So in this case we get
X
s∈Fi
ws = 0 ,
(4.6)
After gluing and following the same steps as for even m this condition becomes equivalent
to the statement that the anomaly cancellation is satisﬁed.

CHAPTER 4. PRINTING OF DIMER MODELS
63
4.2
Potential
To describe the superpotential for printed theories we again start with the quiver block and
write the superpotential for an arbitrary quiver block Qp. We will divide the divide the
superpotential into two parts:
• The ﬁrst part consists of terms that descend from the superpotential of Q. To write
it is convenient to choose a polarization of quiver that makes the perfect matching p
manifest. By this we mean that we write the ﬁelds that are not in p as X (c)
i,j and it’s
conjugate which is in p as ¯
X (m−c)
j,i
. Since p is a perfect matching so with this convention
each term in the superpotential contains exactly one barred ﬁelds. Using the cyclicity
for superpotential terms we bring any superpotential term to the form (upto a sign)
X (c1)
i1,i2X (c2)
i2,i3 · · · X (cn−1)
in−1,in ¯
X (cn)
ini1
(4.7)
Where Pn
k=1 cn = m −1 as required by the degree constraint on the superpotential.
This terms gives rise to a number of terms in the superpotential for quiver block Qp.
Two of these use only the descendant ﬁelds that are on the two boundaries of quiver
block. These are
X(c1)
i1,i2X(c2)

+ X(c1)
i1,i2X(c2)
i2,i3 · · · X(cn)

in,i1
(4.8)
Notice in accordance with the construction of periodic quiver for Qp earlier the degree
of descendant of the ﬁeld in q has increased by 1 while the degree of descendants of
other ﬁelds is the same. As a result the total degree of superpotential increases by 1
as required.
In addition to these there are terms that use the ﬁelds that interpolate between two

In addition to the signs explicitly written above we multiply these descendants of a
given term in WQ with the sign with which their parent term enters WQ.
• None of the terms we have described above use the ﬁeld X(0)
i,i . These occur in some
new cubic interactions that connect the bulk descendant of ¯

In this expression s is a sign which is +1 for a (+) quiver block and (−1) for a (−)

m + 1 graded quiver and to get all these terms we sum over all the ﬁelds ¯

in the
perfect matching q.
4.2.1
Kontsevich Bracket
Next we show that the superpotential we have written satisﬁes the Kontsevich bracket. For
this we divide the total superpotential in four parts
W = WB + WB + WID + WIC
(4.11)
where WB consists of terms that only involve ﬁelds on the lower boundary, similarly WB
consists of terms only involving ﬁeld on the upper boundary. These terms descend from the

CHAPTER 4. PRINTING OF DIMER MODELS
65
superpotential WQ of parent periodic quiver Q and correspond to (4.8).
WID consists of term that descend from WQ but involve ﬁeld that interpolate between
the boundaries i.e the terms that correspond to (4.9).
Lastly WIC consist of the cubic
interactions given in (4.10).
By inspecting the terms in this decomposition of superpotential we gather that the non-
trivial contribution to Kontsevich bracket are

The three terms on the ﬁrst line all vanish independently as a consequence of the fact that

The third term is slightly more complicated. Instead of a single evaluation it reduces to a
sum of such evaluations.
The three terms on the last lines vanish independently of any restrictions on the super-
potential WQ. Due to simple form of WIC this can be veriﬁed directly by a simple if tedious
calculation.

CHAPTER 4. PRINTING OF DIMER MODELS
66
4.2.2
Gluing for Potential
When we glue two quiver blocks Qp and Qq along a boundary their superpotentials are
combined. As mentioned before the ﬁelds that are common to both p and q are identiﬁed. If
a ﬁeld X (c)
i,j is in p but q contains its conjugate ¯
X (m−c)
j,i
then these two ﬁelds result in massive
pair. The sign of the mass term is arbitrary except for one exception which we will describe
a bit later. We can integrate these massive ﬁelds out to obtain the ﬁnal periodic quiver.
Since the individual quiver blocks satisfy the vanishing of Kontsevich bracket the same
is true for superpotential after gluing.
It is straightforward to verify that the only new
contributions to {W, W} come for mass terms and these cancel among themselves.
4.2.3
Toric Condition
The superpotential obtained after gluing automatically satisﬁes toric condition for an m+1-
graded quiver i.e every degree m ﬁeld contributes to precisely two terms with opposite sign.
To show this start with the superpotential for a quiver block Qp. There are four ways
that a ﬁeld of degree m can arise in it:
• A ﬁeld ¯
X (m−1)
i,j
of degree m −1, in Q is in the perfect matching p. Then it gives rise
to two boundary ﬁelds of degree m i.e ¯X(m)
i,j
and ¯X(m)
i,j . The only superpotential terms
these take part in are (4.8). Since the superpotential of Q satisﬁes the toric condition
so ¯
X (m−1)
i,j
takes part in exactly two terms with opposite signs and the same remain
true of its two descendants.
• A ﬁeld X (m−1)
i,j
of degree m −1 in Q is not in the perfect matching p. In this case it
gives rise to a bulk ﬁeld X(m)
i,j . The only terms it appears are (4.8) and hence the terms
in which X(m)
i,j
appears are in one to one correspondence with terms in which X (m−1)
i,j
and as a result toric condition is satisﬁed for it.

CHAPTER 4. PRINTING OF DIMER MODELS
67
• There is a degree m ﬁeld i.e a conjugate chiral ﬁeld X (m)
i,j
in Q which is in p. Then it
gives rise to a bulk descendant X(m)
i,j . X (m)
i,j
cannot appear in any superpotential term
in Q so the only terms that X(m)
i,j
appears in are (4.10). Hence there are again two
such terms. Since all the other ﬁelds are chirals ﬁelds so these terms don’t have any
sign changes due to signs in (4.10) and come with opposite signs.
• Lastly a ﬁeld X (m)
i,j
of degree m in Q which is not in p will give rise to two boundary
ﬁelds X(m)
i,j
and X(m)
i,j
of degree m. Each of the two appear in a single term i.e
−sX(m)
i,j Xj,jX(0)
j,i
(4.15)
sXi,iX(m)
i,j X(0)
j,i
(4.16)
In this case upon gluing each of the two quiver blocks that get glued along it provide
one term so we obtain the two terms as required. The factors of s was introduced in
(4.8) to ensure that the two terms have opposite signs in all cases of (+, +), (−, −) and
(+, −) gluings in the case where ¯
X (0)
j,i is in the perfect matchings associated with both
quiver block being glued. If this is not the case then the second term will be a mass
term and will just add it with the opposite sign of the other term to ensure that the
toric condition is satisﬁed5.

Examples
We ﬁnish this section by writing the superpotential for the examples of quiver block shown
in Figure 4.3 and Figure 4.4. For the C2/Z2 all the terms are the cubic interactions coming
5If we add such a mass term with wrong sign or don’t use the factor of s in (4.10) then we will need to
do ﬁeld redeﬁnitions to satisfy the toric condition. Our deﬁnition of perfect matching is insensitive to such
a redeﬁnition, so we will obtain the right moduli space or equivalently toric diagram even without it

from (4.10) since the parent geometry has no superpotential. It is
W = X0,0X0,1X0,1 + X1,1X1,0X0,1 −X0,1X1,1X1,0 −X1,0X0,0X0,1
(4.17)
All the ﬁelds that appear in the superpotential are chiral ﬁelds i.e they have degree zero, so
we have omitted the degree in the superscript to follow the standard convention of 4d N = 1
theories.
Similarly to more closely follow the standard notation for N = (0, 2) theories we will
write the superpotential in terms of J and E terms. For the C3 quiver block in Figure 4.4,
we get6

used to diﬀerentiate multiple ﬁelds of same degree between the same nodes. To emphasize that it is not the

Printing and Geometry
In this section we explain how printing gives rise to the desired toric diagram. We do so by
relating the perfect matchings of the m-graded parent theory Q with the perfect matchings
of m + 1-graded printed theory. For simplicity, let us assume that a single point in TCYm+2
is lifted; extending the discussion to the general case in which multiple points are lifted is
straightforward. For the arguments in this section, it is convenient to label gauge groups in
the (m+1)-graded quiver gauge theory using a pair of indices (i, a), where i runs over nodes
in the 4d quiver and a runs over quiver blocks.
Let us ﬁrst consider the case in which a point is lifted using a single perfect matching p.
From p, we can construct a brick matching q0, given by
q0 = ∪n
a=1q(a) ,
(4.20)
where q(a) denotes the descants of ﬁelds in p within the quiver block a. For a (+) block it is

CHAPTER 4. PRINTING OF DIMER MODELS

given by
q(a) =
n
¯X(c)
(i,a+1)(j,a), ¯X(c+1)
(i,a)(j,a), ¯X(c+1)
(i,a+1)(j,a+1)| ¯

(4.22)
In both these equations the second set consists of conjugates of all the chiral ﬁeld that
descend from the gauge groups of parent theory. It is straightforward to verify that q0 is
indeed a perfect matching. Notice that this type of perfect matching does not contain any
vertical chiral ﬁelds X(0)
(i,m)(i,m±1), where the signs are those of the quiver blocks. This fact
implies that q0 is not lifted, i.e. it remains on the original TCYm+2 embedded in the central
plane.
From the previous discussion, it becomes clear that in order to construct perfect match-
ings for the lifted points it is necessary to include vertical chiral ﬁelds. Let us denote B(+)
and B(−) the sets of (+) and (−) blocks for the perfect matching p, respectively. The prefect
matchings that descend from p and have maximum and minimum vertical coordinates in
TCYm+3 are given by
qmax
=
(∪a∈B(+){X(0)
(i,a)(i,a+1)}
∪
˜q(a))

(∪b∈B(−)q(b))

∪
(∪b∈B(+)q(b))
(4.23)
Where for a (+) quiver block
˜q(a) =
n
X(m−c+1)
(j,a)(i,a+1), ¯X(c+1)
(i,a)(j,a), ¯X(c+1)
(i,a+1)(j,a+1)| ¯
X (c)
ij ∈p

(4.24)

while for (−) quiver block
˜q(a) =

n

(4.25)
with the q(a) deﬁned as in (4.21) and (4.22). Similarly, generalizing (4.23) to include vertical
chiral ﬁelds in n+ of the (+) blocks and n−of the (−) blocks, we obtain perfect matchings
with n+ −n−vertical displacement. In fact q0 is the n+ = n−= 0 case of this construction.
These arguments extend to the case in which multiple points in the original toric diagram
are lifted.
In general, the perfect matchings we have just described are not all the perfect matchings
of the resulting theory, but they contain all the ones corresponding to the corners of TCYm+3.
Inconsistent Printing.
So far, we have restricted to a single perfect matching per lifted
point. Let us consider what happens if we use multiple perfect matchings associated to the
same point of the original toric diagram. If two or more perfect matchings from the same
point are used on quiver blocks with the same sign, it is easy to check that naively applying
(4.23) we do not obtain brick matchings. This is the ﬁrst indication of a pathology. In this
case the points are not actually lifted by the expected amount, we end up with multiple brick
matchings on some corners of TCYm+3 and the resulting generalized dimer model is reducible.
Reducibility or, equivalently, inconsistency of dimer models and how to ﬁx it was discussed
in [1] for the case of m = 2. There is no problem, however, with using two diﬀerent perfect
matchings corresponding to the same point if the corresponding quiver blocks have diﬀerent
signs. Of course, we can use more perfect matchings and reduce the brane brick model at
the ﬁnal stage.

Examples
We ﬁnish this section with a couple of examples of printing. The principal aim here is to
elucidate the construction we have described with some simple examples. As a result we will
construct three well known theories. The ﬁrst of these is the 4d N = 1 theory corresponding
to F0. F0 has two phases and both can be produced using printing starting from the 6d (1, 0)
theory that corresponds to C2/Z2.
The other two theories are 2d (0, 2) theories corresponding to the dimensional reduction
of conifold and D3 [28]. Printing will later be utlized in §9 as part of the quest to construct
a inﬁnite family that is a generalization of conifold. Some other examples and discussion of
this process in the context of 2d (0, 2) theories can be found in [1].
4.4.1
F0 from C2/Z2
As shown in Figure 4.7 the toric diagram of F0 can be obtained by starting from the toric
diagram of C2/Z2 and lifting the central point both up and down.
So to construct the
periodic quiver for 4d N = 1 theory corresponding to F0 we need one (+) quiver block and
one (−) quiver block. There are two perfect matchings that correspond to the central point
of C2/Z2 and we get diﬀerent phases of F0 depending on whether (+) and (−) quiver block
are both built from the same perfect matching or diﬀerent perfect matchings.

Same Perfect Matching
The process of printing the periodic quiver for F0 using the same perfect matching for both
the (+) and (−) quiver blocks is depicted in Figure 4.8. The perfect matching used can be
determined by the orientation of arrows on the boundaries of two quiver blocks. On gluing
the two quiver blocks the nodes 0 and 2 are identiﬁed and we label the resulting node by
0. Similarly the node 1 results from the identiﬁcation of 1 and 2, node 2 from 0 and 2 and
lastly node 3 from the identiﬁcation of nodes 1 and 3. The result is the phase II of F0.
Since there is no superpotential for C2/Z2, the superpotential for printed theories consists
entirely of cubic terms. It can be read straightforwardly from the faces of the periodic quiver
or determined by the prescription given earlier. It is

Diﬀerent Perfect Matchings
Figure 4.9 shows the process of printing a periodic quiver for F0 using diﬀerent perfect
matchings for (+) and (−) quiver blocks. The labeling of the nodes resulting from gluing is
the same as for the case of same perfect matchings for both quiver blocks. In this case all
the ﬁelds on the boundaries of two quiver blocks becomes massive and are integrated out.
The result is the Phase I of F0.
Because of these massive ﬁelds in addition to the cubic interactions there are also
quadratic mass terms. The superpotential at this stage is

Dimensional Reduction of Conifold from C3
Let us start from C3 and lift two corners of the toric diagram in the same direction, as shown
in Figure 4.10. We obtain the toric diagram for the conifold × C.
Figure 4.11 shows the two quiver blocks and how they are glued. The perfect matching
used for each of the quiver blocks can be identiﬁed from the Fermis on the boundaries. We
glue the quiver blocks identifying 1 and 2 (we call the resulting node 1) and 1 and 2 (which
we call 2).

From the periodic quiver at the center of Figure 4.11 and, equivalently, the linear E-terms
in (4.29), we see that this theory has four chiral-Fermi massive pairs. Integrating them out,
we obtain the periodic quiver on the right of Figure 4.11, and the following J- and E-terms:

The theory we obtained is, as expected, the dimensional reduction of the conifold gauge
theory. This is a simple example of the kind of situation illustrated in Figure 4.2, in which a
given 2d theory, or more generally 2d theories for the same CY4, can be reached in multiple
ways. It is quite remarkable that the same gauge theory can be generated using diﬀerent
methods and starting from two substantially diﬀerent 4d parent theories: by dimensional
reduction of the conifold gauge theory (a minimally SUSY, chiral theory) or by 3d printing
from N = 4 SYM (a maximally SUSY, non-chiral theory).
4.4.3
D3 from C3
Lastly, let us start from C3 and lift the three corners of the toric diagram in the same
direction, as in Figure 4.12.
We obtain the toric diagram for a geometry that is often
referred to as D3 [28].
The corresponding 3d printing of the periodic quiver is shown in Figure 4.13.

This is precisely the gauge theory for D3 originally found in [28] by partial resolution of
the C4/(Z2 × Z2 × Z2) orbifold. We note that this example illustrates the versatility of
3d printing, since this theory cannot be obtained by dimensional reduction, orbifolding or
orbifold reduction.

Chapter 5
Constructing Dimer Models III:
Products
In the last chapter we described an algorithm dubbed printing that allows us to construct
an (m + 1)-graded quiver gauge theory starting from m-graded quiver gauge theory. It is
a generalization of algebraic dimensional reduction and orbifold reduction that allows us
to construct a large class of geometries very eﬃciently by exploiting a simple relationship
between the toric diagram of desired TCYm+3 geometry with the toric diagram of a TCYm+2.
It is a vast improvement over previously known methods especially orbifolding followed by
partial resolution. Nevertheless it only increases the dimensions of Calabi-Yau one a time
and it can make it intractable to reach a Calabi-Yau with a high dimension from the catalog
of known geometries even if the geometries allows such a construction.
In this chapter we present a new algorithm which we call “product” which allows us
to escape this diﬃculty for a large class of geometries and in the process again provides
new insights about the structure of the resulting dimer models. This is an independent
generalization of dimensional reduction and orbifold reduction.
As we will later see the
region where these two methods overlap corresponds to the case when one of two geometries
80

CHAPTER 5. PRODUCTS OF DIMER MODELS
81
involved is 2-dimensional i.e it corresponds to m = 0.
5.1
Products and Toric Calabi-Yau
As before we start with a general description of relation between the geometries connected
by the process of products. The algorithm allows us to construct an m + n + 1-dimer from
an m-dimer and an n-dimer but as in the case of printing it is more convenient to deﬁne it
in terms of dual periodic quivers. The inputs of this algorithm are
• A m-graded periodic quiver P associated with a Calabi-Yau m + 2-fold CYm+2. We
also pick a perfect matching p of P. The toric diagram TCYm+2 is an m+1 dimensional
convex polytope with points ui in it. We assume without loss of generality that p
corresponds to point the u0.
• A n-graded periodic quiver Q associated with a Calabi-Yau n + 2-fold CYn+2 with a
perfect matching q of Q. We will label the points in n + 1-dimensional toric diagram
TCYn+2 by vi and again assume that q corresponds to v0.
The output of this algorithm is an m + n + 1-graded periodic quiver we will call Pp × Qq.
This periodic quiver corresponds to n + m + 3 dimensional Calabi-Yau CYn+m+3 and the
corresponding toric diagram TCYn+m+3 is the convex hull of points
{(ui, v0)|ui ∈TCYm+2} ∪{(u0, vi)|vi ∈TCYn+2}
(5.1)
This toric diagram is a lattice polytope in Zm+n+2. In this lattice, the toric diagram TCYm+2
gets embedded in a plane spanned by ﬁrst m + 1 coordinates, while TCYn+2 gets embedded
in a plane spanned by last n + 1 coordinates. These planes are orthogonal and meet at a
single point i.e (u0, v0).

CHAPTER 5. PRODUCTS OF DIMER MODELS
82
Figure 5.1: An example of relation between the input and output geometries for products.
The perfect matchings p and q corresponded to the points shown in cyan on the right hand
side. The horizontal geometry on the right is C2/Z5 while the vertical geometry is C2/Z3.
Their product results in the toric diagram shown on the left. The dashed lines show the
embedding of two original geometries within it.
Choosing diﬀerent phases of the two theories involved in the product results in the same
geometry. Likewise using diﬀerent perfect matchings belonging to the same point in the
toric diagram result in diﬀerent phases of the same the theory. We have seen this freedom in
printing too and we expect these diﬀerent phases to be related by a sequence of mutations.
5.2
Product of Periodic Quivers
After explaining the connection between the geometries we now turn to the question of
implementing it for gauge theories by constructing the periodic quiver.
Since for every ﬁeld a perfect matching contains either the ﬁeld or its conjugate, it deﬁnes
a polarization of the quiver. Using the polarization on P given by p and polarization on Q
given by q we will deﬁne a polarization of the periodic quiver for Pp × Qp. As we will see
later this polarization is in fact a perfect matching and corresponds to the point (u0, v0). A
element1 of Pq × Qp arise from the product an element of P and element of Q as follows:
• The product of a gauge group i of P and j of Q gives rise to an gauge group (i, j) of
Pp × Qq.

Figure 5.2: The four cases of elements of P and Q giving rise to elements of Pp × Qq. In all
cases we only consider the ﬁelds in P which are p and the ﬁelds in Q which are in q
• The product of a gauge group i of P with a ﬁeld ¯Y (d)
j1j2 of Q which is in q gives rise to
a ﬁeld ¯Z(d+m+1)
(i,j1)(i,j2) of Pp × Qq. Similarly the product of a ﬁeld ¯X(c)
i1,i2 which in in p with
a gauge group j of Q gives rise to a ﬁeld ¯Z(c+n+1)
(i1,j)(i2,j) of Pp × Qq2.
• The product of a ﬁeld ¯X(c)
i1i2 of P in p with a ﬁeld ¯Y (d)
j1j2 of Q in q gives rise to a ﬁeld
¯Z(c+d)
(i1,j1)(i2,j2). In this case ¯X(c)
i1i2 must be in p and ¯Y (d)
i1i2 must be in q.
This process is depicted graphically in Figure 5.2. This process not only gives us the quiver
for Pp × Qq but also constructs the periodic quiver. This is because given an embedding
of the periodic quiver P on Tm+1 and an embedding of Q on Tn+1, these rules give us an
embedding of Pp × Qq on Tn+m+2.
For the sake of completeness we also describe the conjugates of the ﬁelds we have written
above
2As in the case of printing we will continue to distinguish the element of p and q by putting bars on them.
This choice will again be convenient for writing the superpotential later on.

CHAPTER 5. PRODUCTS OF DIMER MODELS

• The conjugate of ¯Z(d+m+1)
(i,j1)(i,j2) is Z(n−d)
(i,j2)(i,j1). This can be considered as arising from the
product the gauge group i with the ﬁeld Y (n−d)
j2j1
which is not in q.
• Similarly the conjugate of ¯Z(c+n+1)
(i1,j)(i2,j) is Z(m−c)
(i2,j)(i1,j). This can be considered as arising
from X(m−c)
i2i1
which is not in p and gauge group j.
• The conjugate of ¯Z(c+d)
(i1,j1)(i2,j2) is Z(n+m+1−c−d)
(i2,j2)(i1,j1)
and this should be regarded as arising
from X(m−c)
i2i1
and Y (n−d)
j2j1
.
It is important to note that at the end of this process there is no ﬁeld that comes from the
product of a ﬁeld ¯X(c)
i1i2 which is in p with a ﬁeld Y (d)
j2j1 which is not in q or vice versa. It is
precisely this which makes the choice of p and q central to this construction.
Henceforth i will be used to denote a gauge group of P and j a gauge group of Q.
Similarly we will always use X to refer to ﬁelds in P and Y to refer to ﬁelds in Q. Lastly
we will use the pair (i, j) to denote a gauge group and Z to denote a ﬁeld of Pq × Qq. These
will be implicitly assumed to arise from elements of P and Q as described above.
5.2.1
Anomaly Cancellation
We will now show that if P and Q satisfy the anomaly cancellation condition then so does
Pp × Qq. For this we start with enumerating all the ﬁelds that are charged under a given
gauge group (i, j) of Pp × Qq and their contributions to anomaly. These arise from
1. Product of incoming ﬁelds at i in P with gauge group j of Q.
(a) If ¯X(c)
i′i is in p then it gives rise to one ﬁeld ¯Z(c+n+1)
(i′,j)(i,j) incoming at (i, j) which
contributes (−1)c+n+1 to anomaly.
(b) If Xi′i is not in p then it gives rise to one ﬁeld Z(c)
(i′,j)(i,j) incoming at (i, j) which
contributes (−1)c to anomaly.

CHAPTER 5. PRODUCTS OF DIMER MODELS
85
2. Product of incoming ﬁeld at j in Q with the gauge group i of P.
(a) If ¯Y (d)
j′j is in q then it gives rise to one ﬁeld ¯Z(d+m+1)
(i,j′)(i,j) incoming at (i, j) which
contributes (−1)d+m+1 to anomaly.
(b) If Yj′j is not in p then it gives rise one ﬁeld Z(c)
(i,j′)(i,j) incoming at (i, j)which
contributes (−1)d to anomaly.
3. Product of a ﬁeld ¯X(c)
i′i that is in p with a ﬁeld ¯Y (d)
j′j that is in q. This gives rise to
the incoming ﬁeld ¯Z(c+d)
(i′,j′)(i,j) which contributes (−1)c+d to anomaly. This is just the
product of the contribution to anomaly at i of incoming ﬁeld ¯X(c)
i′i and the contribution
to anomaly at j of incoming ﬁeld ¯Y (d)
j′j .
4. Product of an outgoing ﬁeld ¯X(c)
ii′ at i that is in p with an outgoing ﬁeld Y (d)
jj′ at j that
is in q. This gives rise to the outgoing ﬁeld Z(c+d)
(i,j)(i′,j′) at (i, j). Its conjugate contributes
(−1)n+m+1−c−d to anomaly. This is minus the product of contributions to anomaly at i
of incoming ﬁeld ¯X(m−c)
i′i
and the contribution to anomaly at j of incoming ﬁeld ¯Y (n−d)
j′j
.
Adding all these contributions we get that the net contribution by these ﬁelds at the node
(i, j) is
Anet = ap + (−1)n+1ap + bq + (−1)m+1bq + apbq −apbq
(5.2)
Where ap is the net contribution to anomaly by incoming ﬁelds at i which are in p and
ap is the net contribution to anomaly by incoming ﬁelds that are not in p. Similarly bp is
the net contribution to anomaly at node j by incoming ﬁelds that are in q while bq is the
contribution from the ﬁelds that are not in q.
At this point we divide our task into three cases depending on the parity on m and n.
Odd m and n
In this case Anet becomes
Anet = ap + ap + bq + bq + apbq −apbq
(5.3)

CHAPTER 5. PRODUCTS OF DIMER MODELS
86
For odd m and n the anomaly cancellation conditions for i in P and j in Q respectively are
ap = −ap
bq = −bq
(5.4)
Plugging these back into the expression for Anet gives us Anet = 0 which is the required
anomaly cancellation condition since n + m + 1 is odd.
Even m and Even n
In this case the Anet becomes
Anet = ap −ap + bq −bq + apbq −apbq
(5.5)
While the anomaly cancellation conditions for i and j respectively are
ap = 2 −ap
bq = 2 −bq
(5.6)
Plugging these back also results in Anet = 0 which is again the required condition because
m + n + 1 is odd in this case too.
Odd m and Even n
Lastly in this case
Anet = ap −ap + bq + bq + apbq −apbq
(5.7)
And the anomaly cancellation conditions at i and j are
ap = −ap
bq = 2 −bq
(5.8)
which gives us Anet = 2 i.e the required anomaly cancellation condition is satisﬁed since
m + n + 1 is even for this case.

5.3
Superpotential
To complete the description of our construction we describe the superpotential that results
from the product. We can expect from our description of periodic quiver above that the
superpotentials of P and Q play an important part in this process. But in addition there
will be some new cubic couplings. As a result the total superpotential is
W = WP + WQ + WC
(5.9)
Where WP is the part of superpotential that descends from the superpotential of P while
WQ descends from the superpotential of Q. Lastly WC consists of new cubic interactions.
We now describe each of them in detail
Terms descending from superpotential of P: WP
Let us consider a single term TP
in the superpotential W (m) of P
TP = X(c1)
i1i2 X(c2)
i2i3 · · · X(ck−1)
ik−1ik ¯X(ck)
iki1
(5.10)
where P
n cn = m −1 due to degree constraint. We have again chosen to make the perfect
matching p manifest by placing bar on its members and we will arrange the superpotential
such that the ﬁeld in a term that is in p occurs last in it. This term will give rise to a number
of term in superpotential for Pp × Qq. Some of these terms arise from the product of ﬁelds
in this term with a gauge group j of Q. These are
X
j∈J
Z(c1)
(i1,j)(i2,j)Z(c2)
(i2,j)(i3,j) · · · Z(ck−1)
(ik−1,j)(ik,j) ¯Z(ck+n+1)
(ik,j)(i1,j)
(5.11)
Where is sum is over the set J of the gauge groups j of Q. The degree of superpotential
changes by n+1 and becomes m+n after this operation as is required for the superpotential

CHAPTER 5. PRODUCTS OF DIMER MODELS

of an m + n + 1 graded quiver.
These are not all the term in the superpotential for Pp × Qq that TP gives rise to. To
describe the other terms we ﬁrst pick a ﬁeld X(c)
i′i from among those that takes part in TP.
This ﬁeld is not in p. We also pick a ﬁeld Y (d)
j′j that is not in q. We replace X(c)
i′i in Tp by its
product with Y (d)
j′j i.e Z(c+d+1)
(i′,j′)(i,j). This increases the degree by d + 1. We also replace ¯X(ck)
iki1 by
its product with ¯Y (n−d)
jj′
i.e ¯Z(ck+n−d)
(ik,j)(i1,j′). This changes the degree by n −d so the total change
is n+1 as desired. The rest of ﬁelds in TP we just replace by their product with appropriate
gauge group in Q which doesn’t change the degree since these ﬁelds are not in p. Explicitly
these terms are

(5.12)
To obtain WP we repeat this process for all the superpotential terms in W (m). In addition
to the signs written above we multiply the descendants of each term in superpotential of P
with the sign with which it enters W (m).
Terms descending from superpotential in Q: WQ
The terms descending from the
superpotential in Q are similar we just exchange the role of P and Q and also p and q.
Given a term TQ in superpotential W (n) of Q such that:
TQ = Y (d1)
j1j2 Y (d2)
j2j3 · · · Y (dk−1)
jk−1jk ¯Y (dk)

it gives rise to term which can be divided into two sets. The terms in the ﬁrst set only
involve ﬁelds in Pp × Qq that result from the product of a gauge group in P with a ﬁeld in
Q.

(5.15)
The sum of this process for all the terms in the superpotential for Q gives us WQ. In this
case too we multiply all these term with the sign with which their parent term enters the
superpotential W (n).
New Cubic Interactions: WC
The last part of the superpotential comes from some new
cubic interactions. Given a ﬁeld X(c)
i′,i that is not in p and Y (d)
j′j that is not in q we can
construct some ﬁelds that are shown in Table 5.1. Looking at the last column, the ﬁelds in
ﬁrst three rows have degree m + n and they ﬁt into a minimal plaquette of Pp × Qq and
hence they give rise to a term in the superpotential for Pp × Qq. The same is true for the
ﬁelds in the last three rows. So corresponding to each pair of ﬁelds X(c)
i′,i and Y (d)
j′j we get two

5.3.1
Kontsevich Bracket
We now show that the superpotential we have written above satisﬁes {W, W} = 0. To do
this we divide {W, W} into several pieces
{W, W} = KBP + KBQ + KBPC + KBQC
(5.17)
Where KBP is the part that arises due to WP. Explicitly its non-trivial parts are
KBP =

(5.18)

CHAPTER 5. PRODUCTS OF DIMER MODELS

KBP vanishes if the superpotential W (m) of P satisﬁes {W (m), W (m)} = 0. The reason is that
the terms in KBP descend from the terms of {W (m), W (m)} in a manner that is analogous
to how terms in WP descend from terms in W (m) and the signs in (5.12) are such that the
required cancellations still happen.
Similarly KBQ is

and it vanishes if the superpotential W (n) of Q satisﬁes {W (n), W (n)} = 0.
Lastly KBPC and KBQC are

Both KBPC and KBQC vanish independently of any conditions on W (m) and W (n). This
can be veriﬁed directly using the explicit form of WC.
5.3.2
Toric Condition
Before wrapping up our discussion of superpotential we verify that if P and Q satisfy toric
condition then Pq × Qq also does so. We will do so by dealing with diﬀerent ways a ﬁeld of
degree n + m can arise in Pp × Qq case by case. The diﬀerent scenarios are
• A ﬁeld of degree m −1, ¯X(m−1)
i1i2
is in p. In this case its product with a gauge group

CHAPTER 5. PRODUCTS OF DIMER MODELS
92
j of Q gives rise to a ﬁeld ¯Z(n+m)
(i1,j)(i2,j) of degree m + n. The only terms that this ﬁeld
appears are in WP speciﬁcally those in (5.11). So if ¯Xi1i2 takes part in two terms with
opposite signs then so does ¯Z(n+m)
(i1,j)(i2,j). Similarly if there is a ﬁeld ¯Y (n−1)
j1j2
in q then its
product with a gauge group i of P gives rise to ¯Z(n+m)
(i,j1)(i,j2). It only takes part in terms
given by (5.14). As a result it also takes part in two terms with opposite sign.
• The product of a conjugate chiral ¯X(c)
i1i2 that is in p with a conjugate chiral ¯Y (d)
j1j2 that
is in q gives rise to a ﬁeld ¯Z(m+n)
(i1,j1)(i2,j2) of degree m + n. Since conjugate chirals don’t
appear in superpotential so ¯Z(m+n)
(i1,j1)(i2,j2) doesn’t appear in WP or WQ. It only appears
in two terms of WC with opposite sign as shown in (5.16).
• The product of a ﬁeld X(m−1)
i1i2
not in p with Y (n)
j1j2 not in q gives a ﬁeld Z(n+m)
(i1,j1)(i2,j2)
of degree n + m. X(m−1)
i1i2
appears in two terms with opposite sings in W (m). Hence
Z(n+m)
(i1,j1)(i2,j2) appears in two terms with opposite signs. These terms arise as described
by (5.12). Since Y (n)
j1j2 is a conjugate chiral so it doesn’t appear in W (n) and as a result
Z(n+m)
(i1,j1)(i2,j2) doesn’t appear in WQ. It also doesn’t appear in WC.
Similarly product of a ﬁeld X(m)
i1i2 not in p with Y (n−1)
j1j2
not in q gives a ﬁeld Z(n+m)
(i1,j1)(i2,j2)
which only appears in two terms with opposite signs. These terms are in WQ speciﬁcally
among those described by (5.15).
This covers all the ﬁelds of degree m + n. As a result the product of an m-graded toric
quiver gauge theory P with n-graded toric quiver gauge theory Q using arbitrary perfect
matchings is an m + n + 1 graded toric quiver gauge theory.
5.4
Products and Geometry
In this section we explain how products give rise to the desired geometry. We do so by
explaining how the perfect matchings of Pp × Qq result in the toric diagram described by

CHAPTER 5. PRODUCTS OF DIMER MODELS
93
(5.1).
For this we ﬁrst note that all the barred ﬁelds i.e ¯Z(c+n+1)
(i1,j)(i,j), ¯Z(d+m+1)
(i,j1)(i,j2) and ¯Z(c+d)
(i1,j1)(i2,j2)
form a perfect matching. This is the brick matching that corresponds to the “central point”
(u0, v0) of TCYm+n+3.
With a little more eﬀort, given a perfect matching ˜p of P we can construct a perfect
matching we will call ˜p × q of Pp × Qq. If ˜p corresponds to the point ui in TCYm+2 then ˜p × q
corresponds to the point (ui, v0) of TCYn+m+3. In order to construct ˜p × q we divide the ﬁelds
in ˜p into two sets. The ﬁrst set ˜p0 contains the ﬁelds in ˜p that are also in p while the second
set ˜p∗contains the ﬁelds in ˜p that are not in p i.e i.e
˜p0 = ˜p ∩p
˜p∗= ˜p \ p
(5.21)
Then ˜p × q is
˜p × q = (I × q) ∪(˜p × J) ∪(˜p0 × q) ∪(˜p∗× q)
(5.22)
Where q is the set of all ﬁelds in Q that are not in q i.e it is the set of conjugates of ﬁelds in
q. We now deﬁne the sets in the above union. The ﬁrst two of these are deﬁned to be
I × q =
n
¯Z(d+m+1)
(i,j1)(i,j2)|i ∈I, ¯Y (d)
j1,j2 ∈q

(i1,j)(i2,j)|X(c)
(i1,i2) ∈˜p∗, j ∈J

(5.23)
i.e I × q just the set of ﬁelds that result from the product of a gauge group of P with a ﬁeld
that is in q, while ˜p × J is the set of ﬁelds that result from the product of a ﬁeld in ˜p with
a gauge group j of Q. The degree of the resultant ﬁeld changes diﬀerently depending on
whether it is also in p or not which accounts for the two sets in the above equation.

CHAPTER 5. PRODUCTS OF DIMER MODELS

The set p0 × q is deﬁned as
p0 × q =
n
¯Z(c+d)
(i1,j1)(i2,j2)| ¯X(c)
(i1i2) ∈p0, ¯Y (d)
j1j2 ∈q
o
(5.24)
This set has a simple interpretation: it is the set of all the ﬁelds in Pp × Qp that arise from
product of a ﬁeld that is common to p and ˜p with a ﬁeld that is in q.
Keeping this in mind the interpretation of other set becomes clear too: ﬁelds in it come
from the product of a ﬁeld that is in ˜p but not in p with a ﬁeld of Q that is not in q i.e
˜p∗× q =
n
Z(c+d+1)
(i1,j1)(i2,j2)|X(c)
i1i2 ∈p∗, Y (d)
j1j2 ∈q
o
(5.25)
Similarly given a perfect matching ˜q of Q corresponding to the point vi we can deﬁne a
perfect matching p × ˜q that corresponds to (u0, vi). It is deﬁned as
p × ˜q = (I × ˜q) ∪(p × J) ∪(p × ˜q0) ∪(p × ˜q∗)
(5.26)
Where analogous to the case of ˜p we deﬁne ˜q0 = ˜q ∩q and ˜q∗= ˜q \ q while p is the set of
ﬁelds conjugate to those in p. While the the deﬁnitions of four sets in the equation above

It is clear that with these deﬁnitions ˜p × q and p × ˜q both contain either the ﬁeld or its
conjugate for every ﬁeld in Pp × Qq. We show that the ﬁelds in them also cover every term

CHAPTER 5. PRODUCTS OF DIMER MODELS

in the superpotential exactly once.
We begin with ˜p × q and consider WP, WQ and WC separately. Starting with WP let’s
consider a term TP in the superpotential of P. This term gives rise to a number of terms in
WP as shown in (5.11) and (5.12). As ˜p is a perfect matching of P so TP contains exactly
one ﬁeld from ˜p. In a term of WP descending from TP we have three possibilities for this
ﬁeld
• It gets replaced by its product with a gauge group of Q. The resulting ﬁeld is in ˜p × J
so this term is covered exactly once by ˜p × q.
• This ﬁeld is common to ˜p and p and gets replaced by its product with a ﬁeld in q. This
resulting ﬁeld is in ˜p0 × q.
• This ﬁeld is in ˜p but not in p and gets replaced by its product with a ﬁeld not in q.
This resulting ﬁeld is in ˜p∗× q.
So in all three cases the ﬁeld in ˜p that covers the term TP gives rise to exactly the ﬁeld in a
term descending from TP that is in ˜p × q.
Similarly for WQ we consider the terms in it descending from TQ. Such a term in WQ
always contains a ﬁeld one of whose parents is in q. We again consider three cases for what
happens to this ﬁeld in a term arising from TQ.
• It gets replaced by its product with a gauge group i of P. This replacement is in I × q
so ˜p × q covers this term exactly once.
• It gets replaced by its product with a ﬁeld that is common to p and q. In this case this
replacement is in ˜p0 × q so ˜p × q again covers this term once.
• In the last case this term gets replaced by its product with ¯X(m−c)
ii′
: a ﬁeld in p that is
not in ˜p. Unlike the previous case this replacement is not in ˜p × q. Since ¯X(m−c)
ii′
is not

CHAPTER 5. PRODUCTS OF DIMER MODELS
96
in ˜p so its conjugate X(c)
i′i in ˜p. As (5.15) shows such a term also contains another ﬁeld
that comes from the product of X(c)
i′i with a ﬁeld not in q. This ﬁeld is in ˜p∗× q and
hence ˜p × q covers this term exactly once as required for it to be a perfect matching.
Lastly we check that ˜p×q covers each term in WC exactly once. For this we inspect Table 5.1
and consider the following cases
• If X(c)
i′i is in ˜p then both Z(c)
(i′,j)(i,j) and Z(c)
(i′,j′)(i,j′) are in ˜p × J so in this case ˜p × q covers
the two terms in (5.16) exactly once.
• If X(c)
i′i is not ˜p then ¯X(m−c)
ii′
is in ˜p and hence ˜p0. As a result ¯Z(m+n−c−d)
(i1,i2)(j1,j2) is in ˜p0 × q
and in this case too ˜p × q covers the two terms in (5.16) exactly once.
This completes our proof of the assertion of the proof that ˜p × q is a perfect matching. The
same argument reversing the roles of P and Q along with p and q shows that p × ˜q is also a
perfect matching. It is important to note that we cannot use this process to construct ˜p × ˜q
for arbitrary perfect matchings ˜p of P and ˜q of Q. We must have either ˜p = p or ˜q = q. This
is consistent with our expectation that TCYm+2 get embedded on the plane spanned by ﬁrst
m + 1 lattice coordinates with the last n + 1 lattice coordinates ﬁxed to v0. Similarly this
also realizes the fact that TCYn+2 is embedded in the plane spanned by last n+1 coordinates
with the ﬁrst m + 1 coordinates ﬁxed to u0.
Despite this, the perfect matchings we have described above are not all the perfect match-
ings of Pp × Qq. There might be new points in TCYn+m+3 which is the convex hull of points
corresponding to perfect matchings we have constructed (see Figure 5.1). Perfect matchings
corresponding to these points will be generated but don’t descend from a pair of perfect
matchings ˜p of P and ˜q of Q. Another case in which new perfect matchings arise is for the
internal points of the toric diagram TCYm+n+3, which might have the multiplicity of perfect
matchings at them increased.

Examples
To conclude our discussion of products we present a couple of examples of the process we
have described. The ﬁrst theory we will construct is the well known phase II of F0 which we
already encountered in the last chapter. The intention here is not to break new ground but to
have a simple example to illustrate the idea. The second example is a product of the conifold
quiver gauge theory with itself. This results in the construction a of 0d N = 1 matrix model
and although to our knowledge this is the ﬁrst time this theory has been constructed the
aim here too is primarily to convey the idea, for a simple situation where none of the parent
theories have m = 0.
5.5.1
F0
The toric diagram for Calabi-Yau threefold F0 can be constructed by the product of two
copies of C2/Z2 using one of the two perfect matchings for the central point in each case as
is illustrated in Figure 5.3.
The quiver of the parent C2/Z2 theory has two U(N) gauge groups with two 6d (1, 0)
hyper-multiplets stretching between them. There are 4 perfect matchings which correspond
to 4 ways we can orient the 2 hyper-multiplets. Two of these correspond to the two corners of
the toric diagram (shown on the left hand side of Figure 5.3) while the other two correspond
to the central point. As a result we have two choices for each perfect matching. But the two
central perfect matchings are conjugates to each other3 and as a result any choice of perfect
matchings gives the same theory upto chiral conjugation.
The process of the product of periodic quivers in this case is depicted in Figure 5.4. The
result is the phase II of F0. Since there is no superpotential for parent theories in this case so
the superpotential only consists of the new cubic terms that arise as a result of the product.
3Here we note that the m = 0 is the only case for which the conjugates of the ﬁeld in a perfect matching
also form a perfect matching. This is only possible when there is no superpotential.

Figure 5.3: The toric diagram of F0 can be reached by the product two copies of the toric
diagram of C2/Z2. In both cases we used the central point of the toric diagram to take the
product.
These terms can be straightforwardly read from the minimal plaquettes of the quiver.
An Inﬁnite Family F (m)
0
The process discussed above can be continued inductively to
get an inﬁnite family of toric Calabi-Yau (m + 2)-folds indexed by m. The toric diagram of
F (m)
0
is
(0, . . . , 0)

(5.29)
This is of course not a complete description except for m = 1 because to construct a periodic
quiver for F (2)
0
we will need to choose a perfect matching for F (1)
0
and so on. This freedom
hints at the existence of diﬀerent phases of F (m)
0
and for m > 1 the choice of diﬀerent perfect
matching will lead to diﬀerent phases related by mutations. The periodic quiver Q(m) of one

the ﬁrst parent with a ﬁeld of the second.

be discussed in great detail in §10.
5.5.2
Conifold × Conifold
The conifold has been one of the most well studied of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds.
Its
toric diagram in the smallest possible lattice square in Z2 as depicted in Figure 5.5. The
corresponding gauge theory has two SU(N) gauge groups and four bi-fundamental chiral
ﬁelds X01, ˜X01, X10, ˜X10 stretching between them. There are two terms in the superpotential
which is given by
Wconifold = X01X10 ˜X01 ˜X10 −˜X01X10X01 ˜X10
(5.31)
As dictated by the toric diagram of conifold, this superpotential has 4 perfect matchings one
determined by each chiral ﬁeld. Due to this the result of product is independent of which
perfect matching we use up to relabeling. As a result we will drop the reference to the perfect
matching and refer to this theory as conifold×conifold. As a convention we choose the toric
diagram of two conifolds to coincide at origin. Then the resultant Calabi-Yau ﬁvefold has

Here the horizontally aligned points form one conifold and the vertically aligned points the
other. A explained in §5.2 we can construct a polarization of the ﬁelds of Pq × Qq by either
considering the products of ﬁelds that are in p with those in q or equivalently considering
the products of ﬁeld not in p with those not in q. The gauge group and a polarization of
the ﬁelds that result from the product of two conifolds obtained using the second approach
are detailed in Table 5.2. The quiver summarizing matter content of the resulting 0d N = 1
matrix model is shown in Figure 5.6.

Potential.
Since the periodic quiver in this case is a graph on T4 it can’t be displayed
diagrammatically but we can construct the superpotential explicitly using prescription given
in §5.3. We divide the total superpotential into three parts
W = W1 + W2 + WC
(5.33)
Where W1 and W2 are the part of the superpotential arising from the ﬁrst and second
conifold respectively and WC contains the new cubic terms. In Table 5.2 and consequently
the superpotential we are going to write below we have adopted a convention that the
Roman letters correspond to 0d N = 1 chiral ﬁelds i.e they have degree 0 while Greek letters
correspond to 0d N = 1 fermi ﬁelds i.e they have degree 2. The conjugate fermi ﬁelds have
degree 1 and correspond to barred Greek letters. With this in mind the various parts of
superpotential are:

CHAPTER 5. PRODUCTS OF DIMER MODELS
103
W1:
Since there are only two terms in the superpotential for conifold we write the descen-
dants each of them separately. So W1 = W1+ −W1−. Where W1+ consists of the descendants
of the term in Wconifold with positive sign i.e.
W1+ = Z01Z10 ˜Z01Λ10 + Z23Z32 ˜Z23Λ32 + ¯Λ03Z32 ˜Z23 ¯Σ30 + Z01¯Λ12 ˜Z23 ¯Σ30 + Z01Z10 ¯Σ03Σ30

While W1−descends from the term in Wconifold with −sign. It is
W1−= ˜Z01Z10Z01Λ10 + ˜Z23Z32Z23Λ32 + ¯Σ03Z32Z23 ¯Σ30 + ˜Z01¯Λ12 ˜Z23 ¯Σ30 + ˜Z01Z10¯Λ03 ¯Σ30

Relation to Other Constructions
We now brieﬂy explain how the products relate to other known methods for constructing
the quiver gauge theories corresponding to a given geometry:
5.6.1
Algebraic Dimensional Reduction
Algebraic dimensional reduction introduced in [31] is an algorithm allows us to construct
the quiver gauge theory for CYm+2 × C starting from the quiver gauge theory for CYm+2.
It generalized the dimensional reduction of 6d N = (1, 0) theories to 4d N = 2 theories
and dimensional reduction of 4d N = 1 theories to 2d (2, 2) 4 theories which correspond to
m = 0, 1 to arbitrary m.
Algebraic dimensional reduction is a speciﬁc instance of products and corresponds to the
4In both these cases dimensionally reduced theories have greater than the minimal amount of SUSY

product of the quiver gauge theory for CYm+2 with the simplest quiver gauge theory for
m = 0 i.e that of C2. This theory is shown in Figure 5.7 and has two perfect matchings.
We can use any of them and both of these give the same result.
Similarly any perfect
matching used for the CYm+2 theory gives the same quiver gauge theory for CYm+2 × C
upto a relabeling of ﬁelds.
5.6.2
Orbifold Reduction
Orbifold reduction introduced in [45] is a generalization of dimensional reduction that con-
structs a quiver gauge theory for a CY4 from a CY3. It adds a third dimension to the toric
diagram by TCY3 by taking one point from it and putting images of this point up to some
height k+ above the central plane containing the TCY3 and also some depth k−below this
central point (see Figure 5.8).

(dP3 × C)/Zk orbifold with k = 2 and c) an orbifold reduction of dP3 with k+ = 2 and
k−= 1.

CHAPTER 5. PRODUCTS OF DIMER MODELS
106
This process again corresponds to a speciﬁc case of products. The orbifold reduction of a
4d N = 1 quiver gauge theory with periodic quiver P using a perfect matching q corresponds
to the product Pp × A(k++k−)
q
. Here A(k) is quiver for 6d N = (0, 1) theory corresponding to
C2/Zk i.e the aﬃne necklace quiver of type A with k nodes. A perfect matching of an m = 0
quiver is just a choice of orientation of its edges, so the perfect matching p is such that that
k+ arrows point up while k−arrows point down. There are
 k++k−
k−

such perfect matchings.
They all realize theories corresponding to the same geometry and are related by a sequence
of trialities.
5.6.3
Products vs Printing
Products and printing which was described in last chapter are both independent generaliza-
tions of orbifold reduction. Printing is more general in two senses:
• All the geometries that can be reached with products can also be reached by a sequence
of printings that increase m one at a time. On the other hand the converse is not true,
there are geometries that can be realized by printing but not as a product. The simplest
such example is the conifold. As is evident from its toric diagram Figure 5.5, it can be
constructed by lifting both the points in the toric diagram of C2. On the other hand
it is not possible to produce it by a product.
• Even if the same geometry can be realized by both processes, there might be phases
that can be obtained via printing but not via a product. A simple example of this
phenomena is F0. The phase II of F0 can be obtained using either construction but
only printing is able to construct phase I.
Despite these drawbacks using the products is a superior method for geometries that can
be reached via both for several reasons:

CHAPTER 5. PRODUCTS OF DIMER MODELS
107
• Products are much more eﬃcient. This true even for simple geometries. As an example
of this let us look at the process of producing a theory for conifold × conifold. To print
this theory starting from conifold we ﬁrst need to produce an intermediate Calabi-Yau
fourfold which is the dimensional reduction of conifold. Then two points of conifold×C
can be lifted to produce conifold × conifold. Notice that to carry out this process we
will have to compute the moduli space not only of conifold but also the intermediary
conifold×C. The diﬃculties of constructing quiver blocks and then computing the
moduli spaces at each intermediate step makes printing infeasible if the diﬀerence
between the dimension of input geometry and target geometry is large.
• It always produces reduced theories, which is not the case with printing which often
results in inconsistent theories which need to be reduced.
• Unlike printing there are no mass terms in the superpotential that arises from a prod-
uct. This not only reduces the computational burden but it also means that products
give us a much more direct way of arriving at the quiver of the resultant theory.
• More importantly in addition to these computational advantages product provide us
with a concise and much clearer relationship between the input and target geometries.
This is again more striking the bigger the diﬀerence between the dimensions of input
and target geometries is.
After this description of relative merits of two constructions we turn to some specula-
tion about their relation to each other. Although we have restricted ourselves to the case
where the two surfaces are both tori, more generally we can regard products as a method
of producing a quiver embedded on S × T given a quiver embedded on a manifold S and
another quiver embedded on a manifold T. We can also consider the cases when one of the
manifolds say T has a boundary ∂T. In that case the resulting quiver will be embedded on

CHAPTER 5. PRODUCTS OF DIMER MODELS
108
a manifold S × T with boundary S × ∂T. Arguably the simplest case of this is when T is
the line segment I whose boundary is the two endpoints. A quiver block Q(m+1)
p
which is a
graph embedded on Tm × I is actually a product of an m-graded periodic quiver Q(m) using
the perfect matching p with a simple quiver embedded on a line segment as given below
Q(m+1)
p
= Q(m)

(5.38)
As usual we have indicated the perfect matching of m = 0 quiver by giving orientation to
quiver ﬁelds. This realizes both the ﬁeld content and the superpotential of quiver block.
In view of this we fully expect both printing and product to be parts of an overarching
construction which includes both the products of m-graded quivers embedded on manifolds
possibly with boundaries and an operation to glue two such manifolds along their boundaries
under suitable conditions. We leave the task of understanding this construction in complete
generality and its physical realization to a future work.

Chapter 6
Algorithmic Determination of Perfect
Matchings
We have seen that perfect matchings provide a simple combinatorial approach for calculating
the moduli space of m-dimers. While this represents a signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation with respect
to alternative methods, in this section we introduce a considerably more eﬃcient algorithm
for computing perfect matchings, one that does not rely on the direct application of their
deﬁnition. This can be regarded as a generalization to arbitrary m of the elegant approach
based on the Kasteleyn matrix for brane tilings. In order to set up the stage for the new
method, we ﬁrst revisit the Kasteleyn matrix from a new perspective and also consider the
counting of brick matchings for brane brick models.
6.1
Warm up: toric CY 3-folds and brane tilings
As a warm up, we ﬁrst consider the familiar case of brane tilings and how their perfect
matchings can be determined using the Kasteleyn matrix.

The superpotential of a brane tiling consists of an equal number of positive terms W +
a (white
nodes) and negative terms W −

into the Newton polynomial:

Xi x⟨0|Xi,γx|0⟩y⟨0|Xi,γy|0⟩.
(6.2)
The index i labels the edges in the brane tiling. Every entry in K is thus given by the
sum over all edges connecting the corresponding pair of nodes (equivalently, the sum over
all chiral ﬁelds participating in the associated pair of superpotential terms). Furthermore,
every edge is weighted by a monomial in x and y that encodes its intersection numbers with
γx and γy, the fundamental cycles of T2.1
For later generalizations, it is convenient to rewrite (6.1) as Grassmann integral. To every
W +
a and W −
b we associate Grassmann variables θ+
a and θ−
b , respectively. Then we get:
P(x, y) =

a dθ−
a exp
 X

Θ(Xi)Xi x⟨0|Xi,γx|0⟩y⟨0|Xi,γy|0⟩

where the function Θ(Xi) is the product of the Grassmann variables associated to the pair
of superpotential terms in which Xi occurs:
Θ(Xi) = θ+
a θ−

for Xi ∈W +
a , W −
b .
(6.4)
1Minor variations of this deﬁnition exist, depending on whether individual edges of the tiling are labeled
(as in our expression) and additional signs are included.

6.1.2
Permanent vs determinant
The coeﬃcient of the xmyn term in P(x, y) deﬁned as above is the sum (up to signs) of the
perfect matchings, expressed as the products of the ﬁelds in them, corresponding to the point
with coordinates (m, n) in the toric diagram. The signs in the determinant correspond to
the anticommutativity of Grassmann variables. Although their squaring to zero is essential
for (6.3), anticommutativity is not. We can alternatively use commuting variables, i.e. we
deﬁne these variables by
θ2
a = 0
θaθb = θbθa
(6.5)
and we deﬁne the integration in the same way as for normal Grassmann variables
Z
dθa 1 = 0
Z
dθa θa = 1
(6.6)
Here we note that these properties follow immediately if we consider each of these variables
to be the product of two independent Grassmann variables.
Computing (6.3) with this deﬁnition of θ±
i will give us the permanent of the Kasteleyn
matrix. In all the discussions that follow, we can either regard Grassmann variables in the
usual sense or as this modiﬁcation.
6.2
CY 4-folds and brane brick models
Finding perfect matchings of a brane tiling using the Kasteleyn matrix relies crucially on the
fact that every chiral ﬁeld participates in two superpotential terms with diﬀerent signs. But

CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMIC DETERMINATION OF PERFECT MATCHINGS
112
for brane brick models, diﬀerent chiral ﬁelds can take part in diﬀerent numbers of J- and
E-terms (see e.g. [29] for explicit examples). Therefore, we do not expect that the Newton
polytope can be expressed as a determinant. However, its formulation as an integral over
some auxiliary Grassmann variables is more amenable to generalization. In this section we
will investigate such extensions, progressively simplifying them, before moving to general
m-dimers.
6.2.1
First approach: Grassmann variables for plaquettes
Recall the combinatorial deﬁnition of perfect matchings for brane brick model, i.e. brick
matchings, given in §1.3.2. A brick matching p is a collection of chiral and Fermi ﬁelds such
that:
• For every Fermi ﬁeld Λa, p contains exactly either Λa or ¯Λa.
• If p contains Λa, it contains exactly one chiral ﬁeld in each of E+
a and E−
a .
• If p contains ¯Λa, it contains exactly one chiral ﬁeld in each of J+
a and J−
a .
Given this deﬁnition, we can write an expression analogous to (6.3). To do so, we associate
a Grassmann variable to every J- and E-term. There are four variables per Fermi ﬁeld: θ±
a
from J± and ¯θ±
a from E±
a . For every chiral Xi, we deﬁne Θ(Xi) as the following product:
• Every J+
a or J−
a term containing Xi contributes a θ+
a ¯Λa or θ−
a ¯Λa factor, respectively.
• Every E+
a or E−
a term containing Xi contributes a ¯θ+
a Λa or ¯θ−
a Λa factor, respectively.
From a brane brick model perspective, the Grassmann variables in Θ(Xi) are simply those
attached to edges shared by Xi and Fermi ﬁelds.

The Newton polynomial for a brane brick model is then given by

.
(6.7)
6.2.2
Second approach: Grassmann variables for chiral cycles
Although (6.7) provides an algebraic expression for the Newton polynomial, it is considerably
hard to work with. Instead of one top-level integral as in the case of dimer models, it gives
rise to a collection of mid-dimensional integrals whose number grows rapidly with the number
of Fermis.
In order to remedy this, it is convenient to introduce an equivalent deﬁnition of brick
matchings. From now on, we will focus on their chiral ﬁeld content. The reason for doing
this is twofold: the Fermi content of a brick matching is ﬁxed by the chiral ﬁelds in it and
the toric diagram only depends on the chiral ﬁelds. It is straightforward to reintroduce the
Fermis, if necessary.
Let us consider the J- and E-terms associated to a Fermi ﬁeld Λa. The product
JaEa = J+
a E+
a −J+
a J−
a −J−
a E+
a + J−
a E−
a
(6.8)
is a sum of four chiral cycles.
We can alternatively deﬁne the chiral content of a brick
matching as a collection of chiral ﬁelds that contains exactly one ﬁeld from each of these
chiral cycles for every Fermi ﬁeld. It is easy to see that a brick matching as deﬁned above
will have two (not necessarily distinct) chiral ﬁelds from the J- and E-terms of a given Fermi
ﬁeld Λa, and either both of them belong to Ja or both belong to Ea. Hence, it covers either
both J-terms and we add ¯Λa to it or it covers only E-terms and we add Λa. With this
completion with Fermi ﬁelds, this deﬁnition is clearly equivalent to the previous one.

CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMIC DETERMINATION OF PERFECT MATCHINGS
114
Now it is easy to give an expression for the Newton polytope as a top level integral over
auxiliary Grassmann variables. This time we assign θss′
a
to the chiral cycle Js
aEs′
a . Again,
there are four variables per Fermi. The Newton polynomial becomes
P(x, y, z) =

Θ(Xi) Xi x⟨0|Xi,γx|0⟩y⟨0|Xi,γy|0⟩z⟨0|Xi,γz|0⟩
!
,
(6.9)
where Θ(Xi) is now deﬁned as the product of the Grassmann variables for all the chiral
cycles containing Xi.
6.2.3
Final approach: further simpliﬁcation using the trace con-
dition
The previous expression admits a further simpliﬁcation. The so-called trace condition,
X
a
JaEa = 0 ,
(6.10)
is required by 2d (0, 2) supersymmetry and is equivalent to the vanishing of the Kontsevich
bracket (1.7) in the m = 2 case [31]. Due to the trace condition, it is clear that applying (6.8)
to all Fermis, every chiral cycle will be generated twice (with opposite signs). Since we are
just interested in counting diﬀerent chiral cycles, we can reduce the number of Grassmann
integrations by half, e.g. by picking the chiral cycles that occur in this expansion with a
positive sign. Hence, if we assign variables θ+
a to the cycle J+
a E+
a and θ−
a to the cycle J−
a E−
a
the Newton polynomial can be computed as
P(x, y, z) =

where Θ(Xi) now contains a θ+

6.3
An algorithm for general m
Starting from the deﬁnition of perfect matchings for general m-dimers given in §2.2.1 we can
immediately write and expression that computes them, analogous to (6.7). While correct,
such formula would have the same drawbacks we mentioned earlier:
• Since for every ﬁeld Φ, either Φ or ¯Φ is in the perfect matching, the expression would
involve numerous factors in the measure and hence several non top-dimensional inte-
grals.
• It is desirable to focus on chiral ﬁelds only, since they are suﬃcient for reconstructing
the full perfect matchings and for determining the moduli space. This is a considerable
simpliﬁcation since, in general, the number of chiral ﬁelds is signiﬁcantly lower than
the total number of ﬁelds. For example, the Cm+2 quiver contains 2m+1 −1 ﬁelds but
only m + 2 of them are chiral.
Chiral cycles.
Due to these reasons, an expression as a top-dimensional integral deﬁned
in terms of chiral ﬁelds only is very attractive, both conceptually and computationally. This
can be achieved by extending the concept of chiral cycles to general m. Chiral cycles are
oriented cycles in the quiver which only contain chiral ﬁelds and are deﬁned as follows:

CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMIC DETERMINATION OF PERFECT MATCHINGS
116
• The superpotential can be written as:2
W = ˜W +
X
a
Φ(m−1)
a
Ja ,
(6.12)
where ˜W and Ja do not involve ﬁelds of degree m −1. For a term ˜Wr ∈˜W, let us
deﬁne ˜W (1)
r
by:
˜W (1)
r
= ˜Wr
¯Φ(1)
a =Ja
,
(6.13)
i.e. we evaluate every ¯Φ(1)
a
at the corresponding J-term Ja.
We denote W (1) the result of replacing all the terms ˜Wr in the superpotential according
to (6.13). W (1) is a sum of cycles that neither contain ﬁelds of degree m −1 nor their
conjugates, i.e. ﬁelds of degree 1. Note that this process reduces the total degree of
a term by the number of ¯Φ(1)
a
in it. As for brane brick models, due to the vanishing
Kontsevich bracket condition, this process generates multiple copies of the same cycles
(with signs). As previously mentioned, we do not cancel such contributions and count
every cycle once. We apply the same procedure in the steps that follow.
• We continue this process recursively, deﬁning W (k+1) for 1 ≤k ≤⌊m
2 ⌋as follows.
Suppose W (k) is a sum of cycles which do not contain ﬁelds of degree 1 ≤i ≤k or
their conjugates. Then W (k) can be written as:
W (k) = ˜W (k) +
X
a
Φ(m−k−1)
a
J(k)
a
,
(6.14)
where W (k) and J(k)
a
do not involve ﬁelds of degree m −k −1. This form follows
2In the rest of this section, we do not care about signs or numerical factors and regard sums simply as
collections of cycles. In particular, if a given cycle appears twice with opposite signs, we do not cancel the
two contributions but keep a single term indicating the presence of the cycle.

CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMIC DETERMINATION OF PERFECT MATCHINGS
117
immediately from the fact that every term in W has degree m−1 and hence the terms
in W (k) have degree less than m −1.
For a term ˜W (k)
r
of ˜W (k) we deﬁne ˜W (k+1)
r
as:
˜W (k+1)
r
= ˜W (k)
r
¯Φ(m−k−1)
a
=J(k)
a
.
(6.15)
We obtain a collection of cycles that do not contain ﬁelds of degree 1 ≤i ≤k + 1. We
call W (k+1) the sum of the independent cycles obtained at this step.
• This process terminates with W (kmax), where kmax = ⌊m
2 ⌋, which is a collection of cycles
W (kmax)
r
consisting entirely of chiral ﬁelds. These are the chiral cycles we are interested
in.
6.3.1
From chiral cycles to perfect matchings and the toric dia-
gram
It is straightforward to verify that every perfect matching p contains exactly one ﬁeld from
each term of W (k), for 0 ≤k ≤kmax. In particular, this is true for W (kmax), i.e. a perfect
matching contains exactly one chiral ﬁeld from every chiral cycle. Moreover, such a collection
of chiral ﬁelds can be uniquely completed into a perfect matching using the process described
earlier. This provides an alternative deﬁnition of perfect matchings based on chiral cycles.
We can now write a simple Grassmann integral that eﬃciently computes the perfect
matchings and their positions in the toric diagram. It is given by:
P(xµ) =
Z Y
r
θr exp
 X
i
Θ(Φ(0)
i ) Φ(0)
i
Y
µ
x
⟨0|Φ(0)
i
,γµ|0⟩
µ
!
,
(6.16)
where θr is the Grassmann variable associated to the chiral cycle W (kmax)
r
and Θ(Φ(0)
i ) is the

CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMIC DETERMINATION OF PERFECT MATCHINGS
118
product of the Grassmann variables for the chiral cycles that contain Φ(0)
i .
6.4
Chiral cycles for small m
For small m we can easily enumerate all possible types of superpotential terms. As a result,
it is also possible to classify the diﬀerent types of chiral cycles.
Below we present this
classiﬁcation for m ≤4.
m=0.
There is no superpotential so there are no chiral cycles.
m=1.
In this case the superpotential is a holomorphic function of the chiral ﬁelds so every
term in the superpotential is a chiral cycle. As explained in §6.1, assigning a Grassmann
variable to each of them, (6.16) is a Gaussian integral which evaluates to the permanent of
the Kasteleyn matrix.
m=2.
As discussed in §1.3.2 the superpotential in this case has the general form
W =
X
a
Λa(J+
a (Xi) −J−
a (Xi)) + ¯Λa(E+
a (Xi) −E−
a (Xi)) .
(6.17)
Hence, every Fermi ﬁeld gives rise to four chiral cycles cycles
J+
a E+
a , J−
a E−
a , J+
a E−
a , J−
a E−
a .
As we mentioned in §6.2.3, chiral cycles are generated multiple times due to the trace con-
dition. We can obtain the independent chiral cycles by restricting to J+
a E+
a and J−
a E−
a for
every Λa.

CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMIC DETERMINATION OF PERFECT MATCHINGS
119
m=3.
For m = 3, there are two types of ﬁelds: chiral ﬁelds Xi of degree 0 and Fermi ﬁelds
Λa, which by convention we take of degree 2 [30, 31].
The most general superpotential obeying the degree constraint has the form:
W =
X
a
ΛaJa(Xi) +
X
a,b
¯Λa¯ΛbHab(Xi) ,
(6.18)
where Ja and Hab are holomorphic functions of chiral ﬁelds. Vanishing of {W, W} means
that for every Λa:
X
b
HabJb = 0 .
(6.19)
Computing chiral cycles with the procedure introduced in §6.3, we get:
W (1) =
X
ab
HabJaJb .
(6.20)
As mentioned earlier, throughout this section we regard sums simply as collections of cycles,
without caring about numerical factors or implementing cancellations.
These cycles are
composed entirely of chiral ﬁelds and are the chiral cycles.
m=4.
For m = 4, the most general superpotential compatible with the degree condition
takes the form:
W =
X
a
¯ΛJa(Xi) +
X
a,α
h
χαΛaHαa(Xi) + ¯χαΛa ˜Hαa(Xi)
i
+ 1
6
X
a,b,c
ΛaΛbΛcKabc(Xi) , (6.21)
where Xi, Λa and χα have degree 0, 1 and 2, respectively. Ja, Hαa, ˜Hαa and Kabc are holo-
morphic functions of chiral ﬁelds and Kabc is antisymmetric under the exchange of any two
indices. As for any even m, there is a symmetry under the exchange of χα ↔¯χα and the
simultaneous exchange of Hµα ↔˜Hµα.

CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMIC DETERMINATION OF PERFECT MATCHINGS
120
The vanishing of the Kontsevich bracket {W, W} translates into the following conditions:
P
a HαaJa = P
a ˜HαaJa = 0
P
α
h
Hαa ˜Hαb −Hαb ˜Hαa
i
+ 2 P
c KabcJc = 0
(6.22)
Let us now construct the chiral cycles from the superpotential, starting from the terms
Wαa = χαΛaHαa + ¯χαΛa ˜Hαa. We see that:
W (1)
αa = χαJaHαa + ¯χαJa ˜Hαa .
(6.23)
These cycles still contain χα and ¯χα, so we need to iterate the process once more in order to
replace them with chiral ﬁelds. We obtain:
W (2)
αa =
X
b
Jb ˜HαbJaHαa .
(6.24)
Similarly, let us consider the terms Wabc = ΛaΛbΛcKabc. They give rise to the additional
chiral cycles:
W (1)
abc = JaJbJcKabc .
(6.25)
Combining (6.24) and (6.25) we obtain all the chiral cycles for these theories, which are
of two kinds:
Cabα ∼JaHαaJb ˜Hαb
Cabc ∼JaJbJcKabc
(6.26)
As usual, every cycle is generated multiple times due to the relations coming from the
vanishing of {W, W}.

CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMIC DETERMINATION OF PERFECT MATCHINGS
121
6.5
Perfect matchings for general orbifolds of Cm+2
Armed with the technology chiral cycles and the Grassmann integral (6.16) we now return
to the orbifold theories and discuss the resulting combinatorics of perfect matchings.
Chiral cycles.
The chiral cycles for a general abelian orbifold of Cm+2 can be determined applying the pre-
scription presented in §6.3 to the superpotential (3.8). It is however clearer and conceptually
simpler to directly orbifold the chiral cycles of Cm+2. The chiral cycles of Cm+2 are indexed
by elements of Sm+1, so there are (m+1)! of them. Explicitly, to every p ∈Sm+1 we associate
the chiral cycle:
Φ(0;p(1))Φ(0;p(2)) · · · Φ(0;p(m+1)Φ(0;m+2) .
(6.27)
For the orbifolds under consideration, the quiver contains (m + 2)|G| chiral ﬁelds, given
in (3.3). There are (m + 1)!|G| chiral cycles, which can be found by directly orbifolding the
chiral cycles (6.27). They are:
θp
g : Φ(0;p(1))
g,g+gp;1Φ(0;p(2))
g+gp;2,g+gp;2 · · · Φ(0;p(m+1))
g+gp;m,g+gp;m+1Φ(0;m+2)
g+gp;n,g ,
(6.28)
where the θp
g are the corresponding Grassmann variables and
gp;α =
α
X
β=1
gp(β) .
(6.29)

CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMIC DETERMINATION OF PERFECT MATCHINGS

It is now straightforward to construct the Θ functions:
Θ(Φ(0;m+2)
g,g+gm+2) =

p∈Sm+1

g−gm+2
Θ(Φ(0;α)
g,g+gα) =

.
(6.31)
Since Θ(Φ(0;α)
g,g+gi) is a product of (m + 1)! Grassmann variables, we only need the |G|th
power of the exponent in (6.31) i.e. every perfect matching of an orbifold by G has |G| chiral
ﬁelds in it.
Given a collection q of |G| chiral ﬁelds:
q = {Φ(0;µi)
gi,gi+gµi|1 ≤i ≤|G|} ,
(6.32)
q represents a perfect matching if an only if:
|G|
Y
i=1
Θ(Φ(0;µi)
gi,gi2+gµi) =
Y
g∈G
Y
p∈Sm+1
θp
g .
(6.33)
Below we present the implications of this condition for perfect matching on the k-dimensional
“faces” of the toric diagram.
Corners
Every chiral ﬁeld in an orbifold descends from a chiral ﬁeld Φ(0;µ) of the parent Cm+2 theory.
Each Φ(0;µ) gives rise to a perfect matching corresponding to a corner of the toric diagram of

CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMIC DETERMINATION OF PERFECT MATCHINGS
123
Cm+2. Analogously, every corner of the toric diagram of an orbifold is occupied by a single
perfect matching qµ for which the chiral ﬁelds correspond to all the descendants of Φ(0;µ) i.e.
qµ = {Φ(0;µ)
g,g+gµ|g ∈G} .
(6.34)
It is straightforward to check that the qµ satisfy (6.33) and that they are the only such
collections containing the descendants of a single chiral ﬁeld in Cm+2. Therefore, there are
m + 2 corners, which is in agreement with the fact that the toric diagram for an orbifold of
Cm+2 is an m+1-dimensional simplex. The precise shape of this simplex, up to SL(m+1, Z)
transformations, is controlled by the speciﬁc orbifold action.
Edges
Next we consider the perfect matchings that lie on the edge connecting the points corre-
sponding to qµ and qν. The internal points on this edge mix the descendants of Φ(0;µ) and
Φ(0;ν).
Such perfect matchings admit an elegant description in terms of the quotient group
G/Gµν where Gµν is the group generated by:
{ gρ | ρ ̸= µ, ν } .
(6.35)
The elements of G/Gµν are cosets [g] of Gµν in G, i.e.
[g] = { g + h | h ∈Gµν } .
(6.36)
Applying (6.33) to a perfect matching p on this edge results in the condition that if
Φ(0;µ)
g,g+gµ ∈p then for all h ∈Gµν we must have Φ(0;µ)
g+h,g+h+gµ ∈p. Similarly, if Φ(0;ν)
g,g+gν ∈p
then we must have Φ(0;ν)
g+h,g+h+gν ∈p. Then, the chiral ﬁelds in p can be organized in terms of

CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMIC DETERMINATION OF PERFECT MATCHINGS
124
cosets of Gµν, i.e. elements of the quotient group G/Gµν. Concretely, if we deﬁne a new set
of ﬁelds X ρ
[g],[g]+[gρ] as:
X ρ
[g],[g]+[gρ] = {Φ(0;ρ)
g+h,g+h+gρ|h ∈Gµν} ,
(6.37)
every perfect matching on this edge is a collection of X ρ
[g],[g]+[gρ] with ρ ∈{µ, ν}. Since all
X ρ
[g],[g]+[gρ] contain |Gµν| chiral ﬁelds, their number in a perfect matching must be |G|/|Gµν| =
|G/Gµν|. Every perfect matching of this edge can be written as:
q = {X ρ
[gi],[gi]+[gρ]|1 ≤i ≤|G/Gµν|} .
(6.38)
In order to determine whether such q results in a perfect matching, we ﬁrst note that G/Gµν
is a cyclic group generated by [gµ] = −[gν]. Hence, [gµ] deﬁnes the action of a C2/(G/Gµν)
orbifold. We can regard X µ
[g],[g]+[gµ] and X ν
[g],[g]+[gν] as the chiral ﬁelds of this orbifold.3. Then
(6.33) implies that q is a perfect matching via the map given in (6.37) if and only if it is a
perfect matching of the corresponding C2/(G/Gµν) orbifold. As already mentioned, there
is no superpotential for m = 0 theories, hence a perfecting matching simply corresponds to
assigning an orientation to the unoriented chirals. There are 2|G/Gµν| of them, one for every
subset of |G/Gµν|. Given such a subset s, the corresponding perfect matching qs is:
qs = {X µ
[g],[g]+[gµ]|[g] ∈s} ∪{X ν
[g]−[gν],[g]|[g] /∈s} .
(6.39)
Faces
This behavior generalizes to faces of any dimension. There are
 m+2
k+1

faces of dimension k,
one for each collection {µ1, · · · , µk+1} of k + 1 coordinates of Cm+2. The perfect matchings
for such face only involve the descendants of Φ(0;µ1), · · · , Φ(0;µk+1). These perfect matchings
3Since m = 0 for this orbifold, there is a subtlety resulting from the fact that in this case the conjugate
of a chiral ﬁeld also has degree 0. With this deﬁnition, the conjugate of X µ
[g],[g]+[gµ] is X ν
[g]−[gν],[g]

CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMIC DETERMINATION OF PERFECT MATCHINGS
125
can be described in terms of the quotient group G/Gµ1···µk+1 where Gµ1···µk+1 is the subgroup
of G generated by:
{ gν | ν /∈{µ1, · · · , µk+1} } .
(6.40)
G/Gµ1···µk is useful because applying (6.33) to a perfect matching q on this face results in the
condition that if Φ(0;µ)
g,g+gµ ∈q then for all h ∈Gµ1···µk+1 we must also have Φ(0;µ)
g+h,g+h+gµ ∈q.
These perfect matchings can hence be recast in terms of new ﬁelds deﬁned using the cosets
of Gµ1···µk+1 i.e. the elements of G/Gµ1···µk+1. These ﬁelds are given by:
X µ
[g],[g]+[gµ] = {Φ(0;µ)
g+h,g+h+gµ|h ∈Gµ1···µk} .
(6.41)
The condition stated above implies that the perfect matchings on this face can be written
as a collection of X µ
[g],[g]+[gµ]. As in the case of edges, we can regard these new ﬁelds as the
chiral ﬁelds of a Ck+1/(G/Gµ1···µk+1) orbifold with action given by [gµ1], · · · , [gµk]. With this
in mind, we can straightforwardly determine which collections of X µ
[g],[g]+[gµ] correspond to
the perfect matchings. A set of X µ
[g],[g]+[gµ] is a perfect matching via the map in (6.41) if and
only if it is a perfect matching of the Ck+1/(G/Gµ1···µk+1) orbifold described above.
The upshot of this discussion is that the perfect matchings on a k-dimensional face of
an orbifold theory have a remarkably simple and natural description. This face is itself the
toric diagram of an orbifold of Ck+1. The multiplicities of perfect matchings on this face are
the ones obtained from the quiver of the Ck+1 orbifold. In addition, the perfect matchings
themselves are related to the perfect matchings of this Ck+1 orbifold by a simple map.
Internal Points
From the discussion presented above it is clear that a perfect matching at an internal point
must contain at least one descendant of each Φ(0;µ) for 1 ≤µ ≤m + 2. This innocuous

CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMIC DETERMINATION OF PERFECT MATCHINGS
126
statement is enough to rule out the existence of internal points for small orbifold groups. An
internal point must contain at least m + 2 chiral ﬁelds. On the other hand the number of
chiral ﬁelds in a perfect matching of a Cm+2/G orbifold is |G|. Hence the toric diagram has
no internal points if |G| < m + 2.
An Example: Cm+2/Zm+2 with gα = 1
As an example of this discussion let us consider the Cm+2/Zm+2 orbifold with all gα = 1.
Since every gα generates the orbifold group G = Zm+2, all the quotient groups G/Gµ1···µk+1
are trivial. Hence, every k-dimensional face is the toric diagram of Ck+1 and has no points
other than the corners. The perfect matchings at the corners are:
qµ = {Φ(0;µ)
i,i+1|1 ≤i ≤m + 2} .
(6.42)
All that remains is to determine the perfect matchings at the internal point. Since the order
of the orbifold group is m + 2 any such perfect matching can be written as:
s = {Φ(0;1)
i1,i1+1, Φ(0:2)
i2,i2+1, · · · , Φ(0;m+2)
im+2,im+2+1} ,
(6.43)
which satisﬁes (6.33) if
i1 = i2 = · · · = im+2 = i .
(6.44)
Hence we get one perfect matching for every element i of Zm+2. The corresponding perfect
matching si is:
si = {Φ(0;µ)
i,i+1|1 ≤µ ≤m + 2} .
(6.45)
The right hand size can be recognized as the fundamental SU(m+2) multiplet Φ(0;1)
i,i+1, which
is to be expected from the SU(m + 2) invariance of the internal point.

Topological Strings: B-Brane
Realization of Dimer Models
In this chapter we turn to the physical relevance of generalized dimer models for the case
of m > 3 since the setup of D-branes probing geometry is limited to m ≤3. From the
perspective of graded quivers, however, there is no reason to stop at m = 3. While there
is no supersymmetric ﬁeld theory interpretation of general graded quivers, 1 they still have
a natural interpretation as describing fractional branes at a CYm+2 singularity, as we now
explain.
7.1
From B-branes on Xm+2 to graded quivers Q(m)
By themselves, graded quivers with m ≤3 do not encode the full low-energy quantum
ﬁeld theory on the transverse D-branes. Instead, they encode some half-BPS “holomorphic”
information [47] which is protected by supersymmetry.
In type IIB string theory, that
information is preserved by the topological B-twist.
1Formally, a graded quiver with m > 3 would correspond to a “ﬁeld theory” in d = 6 −2m < 0, with nc
distinct types of matter ﬁelds, and with some “superpotential” interactions amongst them.
127

CHAPTER 7. B-BRANE REALIZATION
128
Let us, then, focus on the B-model of the local Calabi-Yau Xm+2. Conveniently, this
maps the problem of analyzing D-branes at a CY singularity to a purely algebraic problem,
since the B-model is independent of the K¨ahler moduli of Xm+2. The D-branes of the B-
model, denoted by E, are called B-branes. They are described as objects in the bounded
derived category of coherent sheaves (the B-brane category, for short) of the variety Xm+2
[48–51]:
E ∈Db(Xm+2) .
(7.1)
For most purposes here, we can think of E as a coherent sheaf with compact support. At
this level of description, there is no restriction on m: the B-model is well-deﬁned on any
Calabi-Yau variety.
A point-like brane at a smooth point p ∈Xm+2 is described by the skyscraper sheaf Op.
When we bring Op to the singularity, it is expected to fractionate into marginally stable
constituents:
Op ∼= E1 ⊕· · · ⊕En .
(7.2)
The B-branes Ei are the fractional branes. They correspond to the nodes of a quiver. In the
main text, we will discuss their identiﬁcation in a few explicit examples, in the case of toric
singularities that admit crepant resolutions.
The open strings between B-branes are described as morphism in the B-brane category.
Algebraically, they are the Ext groups elements:
φ(d)
ij ∈Extd
Xm+2(Ej, Ei) .
(7.3)
We review some of the necessary algebraic geometry in Appendix A. Here, we just note that

CHAPTER 7. B-BRANE REALIZATION
129
Ext groups are indexed by a degree:
d ∈{0, 1, · · · , m + 2} .
(7.4)
The degree corresponds to the BRST charge in the B-model. On a Calabi-Yau (m + 2)-fold,
we have the isomorphism:
Extd
Xm+2(Ej, Ei) ∼= Extm+2−d
Xm+2 (Ei, Ej) ,
d = 0, · · · , m + 2 ,
(7.5)
known as Serre duality. The elements of Ext0 ∼= Hom are identiﬁed with “vector multiplets”
at the quiver nodes. By assumption, we must have:
Ext0
Xm+2(Ej, Ei) ∼= Extm+2
Xm+2(Ei, Ej) ∼= Cδij
(7.6)
for a consistent set of fractional branes. The other Extd group elements (7.3), with degree
d ̸= 0, m + 2, are identiﬁed with the “matter ﬁeld” arrows in a graded quiver:
φ(d)
ij
←→
Φ(d−1)
ij
.
(7.7)
Note that the quiver and Ext degrees are related by c = d −1.
In this way, in principle, one can associate a graded quiver Q(m) to any local CY singu-
larity, of any complex dimension:
Xm+2
←→
Q(m) .
(7.8)
The most non-trivial part of the correspondence is the identiﬁcation of the “interactions”
in either description. On the graded quiver side, there exists a quiver “superpotential” of

CHAPTER 7. B-BRANE REALIZATION
130
degree m −1. On the B-brane side, this corresponds to the A∞algebra satisﬁed by open
string disk correlators.
Based on the known results for m = 0, 1 [52, 53], one would expect that there exists an
equivalence of derived categories between Db(Xm+2) and some suitable derived category of
representations of Q(m). This is indeed the case, as shown by Lam in [54].
In this paper, our goal is to ﬂesh out the basic correspondence (7.8) explicitly, at a
“physical” level of rigor, in a few families of geometries {Xm+2}m∈N. Given a singular CY
variety Xm+2, the procedure to obtain a graded quiver with superpotential Q(m) from the
B-branes on Xm+2 is as follows:
(i) Find a consistent set of fractional branes, {Ei}. This gives the nodes of the quiver.
(ii) Compute all the Ext groups (7.3) between fractional branes. Using the correspondence
(7.7), draw the quiver arrows, with their quiver degrees. 2
(iii) Compute the quiver superpotential from the A∞products between Ext group elements.
(We will explain this last point in later sections.)
While the above procedure is very general and can be applied, in principle, to any singular
Calabi-Yau variety, explicit computations in the B-brane category tend to be technically
challenging. Moreover, the ﬁrst step is problematic, since we do not have, in general, an
eﬃcient method to ﬁnd a “consistent set” of fractional brane in the B-brane category. In
fact, such sets are by no means uniquely determined by the variety Xm+2. Diﬀerent choices of
fractional branes can lead to diﬀerent quivers, which corresponds to “ﬁeld theory dualities”
(in particular, “Seiberg dualities”) when m ≤3. In general, we expect that any such distinct
quivers for a given singularity are related by quiver mutations—see §1.2.1 for a review of
graded quiver mutations [31].
2We only draw half of the arrows, as in (1.3). The other half of the arrows is given implicitly by the
“conjugation” map (1.2).

CHAPTER 7. B-BRANE REALIZATION
131
7.2
B-branes, Ext groups and A∞algebra
Let us now consider the B-model on a local CYm+2 singularity Xm+2. The B-branes are
objects in the derived category of coherent sheaves on Xm+2, as in (7.1). In all the examples
that we consider, there will exist a crepant resolution of the singularity:
π : eXm+2 →Xm+2 ,
(7.9)
with eXm+2 a smooth local Calabi-Yau. Then, all the B-branes of interest will be coherent
sheaves with compact support on complex submanifolds of eXm+2. Intuitively, we simply
have D-branes wrapping all possible closed complex cycles.
Since the B-model is independent of K¨ahler deformations, the B-brane category on eXm+2
must be equivalent to the B-brane category on the singularity Xm+2, but the former is
generally much simpler to describe. In all our examples, the smooth resolution is the total
space of a vector bundle E:
eXm+2 ∼= Tot (E →Bm+2−r) ,
r = rank(E) ,
(7.10)
over Bm+2−r, a compact K¨ahler surface of complex dimension m+2−r; in the simplest case,
we have the canonical line bundle over Bm+1. Then, the B-branes on eXm+2 can be described
more simply in terms of sheaves on Bm+2−r.
The “fractional branes,” denoted by:
{Ei}n
i=1 ,
(7.11)
are distinguished B-branes which “generate” the derived category Db(eXm+2), in some phys-
ical sense. 3 In the setup (7.10), a good set of fractional brane can be obtained from any
3Here we are being voluntarily vague. A better deﬁnition of fractional branes can be given if we are

CHAPTER 7. B-BRANE REALIZATION
132
strongly exceptional collection of sheaves on Bm+2−r [40, 55–59]. The open string states
between two B-branes E and F are identiﬁed with the generators of the Ext groups [48–51]:
Extd
eXm+2(E, F) ,
d = 0, · · · , m + 2 .
(7.12)
The interactions amongst these open string modes are encoded in a A∞algebra. Let us
deﬁne the graded vector space:
A ∼= ⊕i,j ⊕m+2
d=0 Extd
eXm+2(Ej, Ei) ,
(7.13)
of all the Ext groups elements amongst the fractional branes. One can deﬁne the multi-
products mk on the Ext algebra A:
mk : A⊗k →A ,
(7.14)
of degree 2 −k. They satisfy the A∞relations [60]:
X
p+q+r=k
(−1)r+pqmk+1−p(1⊗r ⊗mp ⊗1⊗q) = 0 ,
∀k > 0 ,
(7.15)
Note that, in particular, m1 is a diﬀerential—that is, (m1)2 = 0, and m2 is an associative
product. The Ext algebra A is a minimal A∞algebra, meaning that m1 = 0 identically.
There also exists a natural trace map:
γ : A →C ,
(7.16)
provided with a stability structure on Db( eXm+2), which does depend on the K¨ahler moduli (in physics, that
is the central charge of the D-branes). The fractional branes are obtained by marginal decay of the point-like
brane Op at the singularity.

CHAPTER 7. B-BRANE REALIZATION
133
of degree −m −2. This is used, in particular, to map to top Ext elements of degree m + 2
to elements of Ext0 ∼= Hom.
The multi-products mk on the Ext algebra can be computed in the following manner
[40, 61]. Given any A∞algebra eA, let us denote by H•( eA) to be the cohomology of m1. If
eA has no multiplications beyond m2, it turns out that one can deﬁne an A∞structure on
H•( eA) in such a way that there exists an A∞map [61, 62]:
f : H•( eA) →eA ,
(7.17)
with f1 equal to a particular representation H•( eA) ,→eA, in which cohomology classes map
to (noncanonical) representatives in eA, and such that m1 = 0 in the A∞algebra on H•( eA).
One can then use the consistency conditions satisﬁed by elements of an A∞map to solve
algebraically for the higher products on H•( eA).
In the B-brane description, the algebra eA is the algebra of complexes of coherent sheaves,
with chain maps between complexes. In that construction, m1 is identiﬁed with the BRST
charge of the B-model. The “physical” open string states then live in the cohomology H•( eA),
which gives us the derived category Db(X)—see [63] for a thorough review. The minimal
A∞algebra:
A ≡H•( eA)
(7.18)
is precisely the Ext algebra. In the examples discussed in this paper, each B-brane will
correspond to a single coherent sheaf, which can be represented in the derived category by
a locally-free resolution. The Ext elements can then be represented by chain maps between
resolutions, modulo chain homotopies.
The m2 products in A are given by chain map
composition. The higher products can be computed by the procedure that we just outlined.
In Appendix A, we explain more thoroughly how to perform these computations explicitly.

CHAPTER 7. B-BRANE REALIZATION

7.2.1
From Ext groups to quiver ﬁelds
The relation between the quiver algebra and the Ext algebra was explained by Aspinwall
and Katz in [61], in the physical context of D3-branes at CY 3-folds (m = 1). The general
case is discussed by Lam [54], in a purely mathematical context.
Here, we follow the physical argument of [61]. In that language, the quiver ﬁelds Φ are
sources for the open string vertex operators in the B-model. Given the open string mode
φ ∈A of degree |φ|, there is a one-form descendent φ(1) of degree |φ| −1. Then, to every
φ ∈A, one can associate a “spacetime ﬁeld” eΦ of degree |eΦ| = 1−|φ|, which acts as a source
for φ in the B-model:
S →S +
X
φ
eΦ φ(1) .
(7.19)
Due to our choice of notation for the graded quivers Q(m), following [31], we ﬁnd it convenient
to deﬁne the “quiver ﬁeld” Φ of degree |Φ| = −|eΦ|, so that:
|Φ| = |φ| −1 .
(7.20)
The explains the relation between quiver ﬁelds and Ext elements given in (7.7) in the intro-
duction. 4
Kontsevich Bracket and A∞relations
The graded quiver superpotential W is formally
an element of the path algebra V of graded quiver. As mentioned before there is an important
condition we should impose on W, which can be written as:
{W, W} = 0 ,
⇔
X
Φ
∂W
∂Φ
∂W
∂Φ = 0 ,
(7.21)
4As we just explained, a more natural deﬁnition of the quiver degree would be minus the degree that
we use in this paper. This is the conventions used, for instance, in [54]. (Also in [40].) In our present
conventions, the quiver degree is equal to minus the BRST degree of the B-model.

CHAPTER 7. B-BRANE REALIZATION
135
where the sum is over all the ﬁelds Φ, for a given polarization.
Given the superpotential above, one can deﬁne a diﬀerential, d, of degree −1, acting on
paths of arrows in a quiver. We have the Leibniz rule:
d(fg) = (df)g + (−1)|f||g|fdg ,
(7.22)
with |f| denoting the degree of the path f. The diﬀerential is given explicitly on the quiver
ﬁelds by:
dei = −ei ⊗ei ,
dΦij = ∂W
∂Φij
+ (−1)|Φij|Φij ⊗ej −ei ⊗Φij ,
dΦji = ∂W
∂Φij
+ (−1)|Φji|Φji ⊗ej −ej ⊗Φji ,
de =
X
Φij
(−1)|Φ|  Φji ⊗Φij −Φij ⊗Φji

+ (−1)m+1ei ⊗ei −ei ⊗ei .
(7.23)
This is obviously of degree −1 since W has degree m −1 and |Φ| = m −|Φ|. To write this
diﬀerential we have introduced additional arrows ei from a node to itself along with their
conjugates ¯ei. They should be identiﬁed with vector multiplets in quiver gauge theories.
One can check that this is a diﬀerential:
d2 = 0 ,
(7.24)
provided that (7.21) is satisﬁed.
Algebraically, the graded quiver algebra, V , and the Ext algebra, A, are related as follows
[61]. Let V denote the path algebra modulo the quiver relations, and let eV denote the same
vector space but with the degrees c exchanged with −c. (That is, Φ ∈V and eΦ ∈eV . Let
also eV [1] denote the vector space eV with all degrees decreased by one, and let s : eV →eV [1]

CHAPTER 7. B-BRANE REALIZATION
136
denote the corresponding map of degree −1. Then, A is simply the dual of eV [1]:
A =
 eV [1]
∗.
(7.25)
Then, it turns out that the A∞relations (7.15) on A are equivalent to the existence of the
diﬀerential d, on V [54, 61].
Mapping nodes and arrows.
As anticipated in the introduction, we can assign a graded
quiver Q(m) to a CY singularity. More precisely, we work with a particular crepant resolution
eXm+2. We should also insist on the fact that the quiver is really associated to a particular
set of fractional branes. A diﬀerent choice of fractional branes can lead to a diﬀerent quiver.
Let us now spell out the B-brane-to-quiver correspondence. First of all, of course, the
quiver nodes are in one-to-one correspondence with the fractional branes:
node i
←→
Ei
(7.26)
In the case of a singularity that admits a crepant resolution as in (7.10), the number of
fractional branes (and thus, the number of nodes in the quiver) is equal to χ(Bm+2−r), the
Euler character of the K¨ahler base Bm+2−r—physically, this is because we should have a
basis of wrapped branes that generates the full even-homology lattice.
Secondly, all the quiver arrows Φ of degree |Φ| = c correspond to Ext-group elements x
of degree |φ| = c + 1:
φ(d)
ij ∈Extd
eXm+2(Ej, Ei)
←→
Φ(c)
ij ,
with
c = d −1 ∈{0, 1, · · · , m} .
(7.27)
Of course, Serre duality (7.5) corresponds to the pairing quiver arrows with their conjugates.

CHAPTER 7. B-BRANE REALIZATION
137
Note that we identify the arrow Φij with the Ext element φij. 5 The quiver algebra elements
of quiver degrees −1 and m + 1 correspond to e and e, respectively. The fact that each
element is a loop attached to a single node is a property that we assume of any “allowed
fractional branes,” namely:
Ext0(Ei, Ej) = xtm+2(Ej, Ei) = δijC .
(7.28)
These groups are identiﬁed with the “vector multiplets” in supersymmetric quiver gauge
theories.
The quiver superpotential.
The graded quiver superpotential takes the general form:
W =
X
closed paths p
αp Φ(c1)
i1i2Φ(c2)
i2i3 · · · Φ(c1)
isi1 ,
(7.29)
The sum is over all closed paths,
p = Φ(c1)
i1i2Φ(c2)
i2i3 · · · Φ(cs)
isi1
with
s
X
l=1
cl = m −1 ,
(7.30)
which consists of s concatenated arrows of any degrees cl ∈{0, · · · , m}, subject to the
above constraint—that is, here Φ denotes both the ﬁelds Φ and their “conjugates” Φ. 6 The
superpotential couplings are given by open string disk correlators:
αp =
D
φ(c1+1)
i1i2
φ(c2+1)
i2i3
· · · φ(cs+1)
isi1
E
.
(7.31)
5Note that φ(d)
ij correspond to a morphism from Ej to Ei. While the product of arrows is by concatenation,
the product of two Ext elements correspond to the composition of maps. In our conventions, we then have
the convenient relations:
ΦijΦjk
←→
m2(φij, φjk) ≡φij ◦φjk .
6Notice that while the sum in (7.29) is formally over all closed paths of degree m −1, not all of them are
necessarily in the superpotential since the corresponding coeﬃcients αp may vanish.

CHAPTER 7. B-BRANE REALIZATION

More explicitly, they are given in terms of the multi-products on A, according to:

(7.32)
Note that αp has degree 0, by construction.
7.3
B-model for Cm+2
As a ﬁrst example of B-model computation we again turn to Cm+2 and construct the corre-
sponding quiver gauge theory in terms of B-branes, as in [40]. There is a single “fractional
brane” in ﬂat space, the skyscraper sheaf over a point p, Op. Without loss of generality, we
take p to be the origin of Cm+2. The Koszul resolution at point p is:
0
- Ωm+2 f- Ωm+1 f- · · ·
f- Ω0
r- Op
- 0 ,
(7.33)
where Ωis the cotangent bundle of ﬂat space, and r is the restriction map at the origin.
Lastly, f : Ωk →Ωk−1 is the vector ﬁeld:
f =
X
µ
zµ
∂
∂zµ
,
(7.34)
acting by interior derivative, with zµ the holomorphic coordinates of ﬂat space.
Quiver ﬁelds
The quiver ﬁelds can be computed as the chain maps between two copies of this resolution.
The generators φµ of the Ext1(Op, Op) group, corresponding to chirals, are elements of
ˇC0(Hom1(Op, Op)). There are m+2 of them, transforming in the fundamental representation

CHAPTER 7. B-BRANE REALIZATION

of SU(m + 2). φµ is explicitly given by the chain map

The vector ﬁeld

∂zµ again acts by interior derivative.
The generator of the other Ext groups are given by the antisymmetric composition of
these basic elements. There are
 m+2
k

generators of Extk(Op, Op), given explicitly by:
φµ1···µk = 1
k!φµ1 ◦φµ2 ◦· · · ◦φµk .
(7.35)
If we allow 0 ≤k ≤m + 2, this contains both the generators φ and their Serre dual φ. To
mimic the notation that is natural for the more complicated example of later sections, we
will write φµ1···µk for k ≤m+2
2
and ¯φµ1···µk for k ≥m+2
2 , including the arbitrary choice of some
pairing:
 φ
µ1,··· ,µ m+2
2 , φ
µ1,··· ,µ m+2
2 
,
(7.36)
when m is even. In that case, the number of arrows φ( m+2
2
) is half the dimensions of the
m+2
2 -index representation, since the full representation is spanned by these arrows and their
Serre dual arrows. The Serre dual of φµ1···µk is the generator ¯φµk+1···µm+2, which satisﬁes:
φµ1···µk ◦¯φµk+1···µm+2 = ¯φµ1···µm+2 .
(7.37)

CHAPTER 7. B-BRANE REALIZATION
140
Superpotential
The superpotential can be computed straightforwardly. Since we deﬁned higher Ext gener-
ators as compositions of Ext1 generators, composing them gives:
m2(φµ1···µj, φµj+1···µk) = φµ1···µk ,
m2(φµ1···µj, ¯φµj+1···µk) = ¯φµ1···µk ,
m2(¯φµ1···µj, ¯φµj+1···µk) = ¯φµ1···µk .
The deﬁnition (7.35) is valid both for the ˇCech cohomology classes as well as for their explicit
representatives, therefore all f2 are trivially zero. Hence all higher products vanish.
Thus, all the superpotential terms present are the cubic terms we postulated before. We
can compute the coeﬃcients straightforwardly using (7.37). They are
γ(m2(m2(φµ1···µj, φµj+1···µk), ¯φµk+1···µm+2)) = ϵµ1···µm+2 ,
in agreement with (2.9).

Chapter 8
The Cm+2/Zm+2 Orbifolds
As a ﬁrst family of non-trivial CY singularities, let us consider the orbifolds Cm+2/Zm+2,
with the cyclic group acting on ﬂat space as:
zi ∼e
2πi
m+2zi ,
i = 1, · · · , m + 2 ,
(zi) ∈Cm+2 .
(8.1)
This singularity can be resolved to a local Pm+1. We thus have:
Xm+2 ∼= Cm+2/Zm+2 ,
eXm+2 ∼= Tot

Let us ﬁrst derive the quiver by toric methods.
We will then discuss B-branes on the
resolution eXm+2.

are correlated with the degree. As in the unorbifolded case, Φ(c)
i,i+c+1 transforms in the
antisymmetric (c + 1)-index representation of SU(m + 2).
• For even m, the multiplicity of the unoriented degree m
2 ﬁelds is only equal to the full
dimension of the corresponding representation.
Superpotential.
Using the convention for contracting SU(m + 2) indices introduced in
(2.8), the superpotential is given by

(8.4)
Below, we will perform various non-trivial checks of the proposed quiver theories. Similar
tests will be presented for all the inﬁnite families of theories considered in this paper. We
will then independently derive these quiver theories using the B-model.
8.2.1
Generalized anomaly cancellation
Let us verify that the quivers introduced above satisfy the generalized anomaly cancellation
condition discussed in §1.2.2. Let us assume that the ranks of all nodes are equal to N.
Then, for a Cm+2/Zm+2 orbifold, the contribution to the anomaly at any node due to the

which is precisely the condition for cancellation of anomalies. It is straightforward to show
that the only solution to the anomaly cancellation conditions corresponds to equal ranks, as
we have assumed. The theories considered in coming sections will exhibit a richer behavior
in that respect.
8.2.2
Kontsevich bracket
Let us now compute the Kontsevich bracket {W, W} for the superpotential in (8.4) and check
that it vanishes. To do so, we need to take into account the rule for cyclic permutations of
arrows. Consider a cycle A(c;k)
i,j B(d;l)
j,i , where A(c;k)
i,j
and B(d;l)
j,i
are monomials of arrows. Note
that the diﬀerence between the number of SU(m + 2) indices and the degree of a monomial
is equal to the number of arrows in it. The commutation relation is:
A(c;k)B(d;l) = (−1)cd+klB(d;l)A(c;k) .
(8.6)
The superpotential has degree m −1 and m + 2 indices, so any term in it can be written
as A(m−1−c;m+1−c)
i,j
Φ(c;c+1)
j,i
, with A(m−1−c;m+1−c)
i,j
a quadratic monomial and Φ(c;c+1)
j,i
an arrow.
We then have:
A(m−1−c;m+1−c)
i,j
Φ(c;c+1)
j,i
= (−1)m+1−cΦ(c;c+1)

(8.10)
To simplify the resulting expression we use that fact that all terms in {W, W} have degree
m−2 and m+2 global symmetry indices. For a monomial B(m−2−c;m+1−c)
i,j
Φ(c;c+1)
j,i
in {W, W}
we then have:
B(m−2−c;m+1−c)

= (−1)m+1Φ(c;c+1)
j,i
B(m−2−c;m+1−c)

(8.11)
Using this rule, it is straightforward to verify that {W, W} = 0.
8.3
Moduli space
We can verify that the moduli space of the quiver indeed corresponds to Cm+2/Zm+2, using
perfect matchings.
Below we present the main results, namely the ﬁeld content of the
perfect matchings and how they are mapped to points in the toric diagram. Such detailed
information not only conﬁrms that the moduli space corresponds to the desired geometry, but

CHAPTER 8. THE CM+2/ZM+2 ORBIFOLDS
147
can also be used, for example, to identify the graded quiver counterpart of partial resolutions.
We will study examples of partial resolutions in §9.3 and §10.5.
Let us consider how perfect matchings give rise to the toric diagram in (8.3).
It is
convenient to divide the perfect matchings according to how they transform under the global
SU(m + 2) symmetry. We consider this approach, which is primarily based on the global
symmetry, to be illuminating. It is of course also straightforward to determine the perfect
matchings by direct application of their deﬁnition and to ﬁnd their positions in the toric
diagram from the intersections between their chiral ﬁelds and the boundaries of a unit cell
in the corresponding periodic quiver.
Internal Point.
The internal point of the toric diagram, v0 = (0, . . . , 0), is the only
one that is invariant under SU(m + 2). This implies that all perfect matchings that are
invariant under SU(m + 2) correspond to this point. We label these perfect matchings by
si, i = 1, . . . , m + 2. They are given by:
Perfect matching
Chirals
Additional ﬁelds
s0
¯Φ(0;1)
m+1,0
¯Φ(m+1−k+j;m+2−k+j)

j,k
(j < i and j < k)
¯Φ(m+1−k+j;m+2−k+j)
k,j
(k > j ≥i)
(8.12)
We have indicated the chiral ﬁeld content separately, since it is what matters for the moduli
space. From the expression of the superpotential (8.4), s0 is evidently a perfect matching. All
the si can be determined by the following simple rule. Given an unbarred ﬁeld Φ(k−j−1;k−j)
j,k
,
it is in the perfect matching iﬀj < i; otherwise, its conjugate is in the perfect matching. It
is straightforward to verify that this results in a collection of ﬁelds which covers each term
in the superpotential exactly once.

CHAPTER 8. THE CM+2/ZM+2 ORBIFOLDS
148
Corners.
The SU(m+2) symmetry permutes the corners vµ, µ = 1, . . . , m+2, of the toric
diagram. Thus, the perfect matching associated to any corner breaks the SU(m + 2) down
to SU(m + 1) × U(1). In order to ﬁnd the perfect matching corresponding to a corner it is
suﬃcient to consider how a given representation of SU(m+2) decomposes under SU(m+1).
Since this breaking corresponds to picking a particular SU(m + 2) fundamental index µ,
this behavior is very simple: Φ(k−1;k)
i,i+k
decomposes into two representations, Φ(k−1;k;µ)
i,i+k
and
Φ(k−1;k;µ), of SU(m+1). They are in the (k−1)−and k-index antisymmetric representations
of SU(m + 1), respectively. Explicitly:
(Φ(k−1;k;µ)
i,i+k
)ν1···νk−1 = (Φ(c;k)
i,i+k)µν1···νk−1
(8.13)
(Φ(k−1;k;µ)
i,i+k
)ν1···νk = (Φ(c;k)
i+k,k)ν1···νk
νj ̸= µ
(8.14)
Similarly, ¯Φ(m+1−k;m+2−k)
i+k,i
decomposes into two representations and, in keeping with our
convention of making all quantum numbers explicit, the conjugate of Φ(k−1;k;µ)
i,i+k
is ¯Φ(m+1−k;m+2−k;µ).
Under this breaking, the terms in the superpotential decompose as
Φ(j−1;j;µ)
i,i+j
Φ(k−1;k;µ)
i+j,i+j+k ¯Φ(m+1−j−k;m+2−j−k;µ)
i+j+k,i

i+j+k,i
(8.15)

CHAPTER 8. THE CM+2/ZM+2 ORBIFOLDS

Hence we see that, for every µ, we get a perfect matching pµ containing the following ﬁelds:
Perfect matching

(8.16)
In summary, the perfect matchings give rise to the toric diagrams in (8.3), conﬁrming
that the moduli spaces of these quiver theories are indeed the desired Cm+2/Zm+2 orbifolds.
8.4
B-model computation
Let us now consider the B-model on the Cm+2/Zm+2 orbifold. This orbifold admits a crepant
resolution as the total space of the canonical line bundle over Pn:
eXm+2 = Tot(O(−m −2) →Pm+1) .
(8.17)
The following set of sheaves form a strongly exceptional collection on Pm+1:

Ωm+1(m + 1)[m + 1] , Ωm(m)[m] , · · · , Ω(1)[1] , O
	
.
(8.18)
Denoting by i the embedding i : Pm+1 →˜Xm+2, the m + 2 fractional branes on (8.17) can
be written as: 2

Ej ≡i∗Ωj(j)[j]
 0 ≤j ≤m + 1
	
.
(8.19)
2To correctly compute the morphisms below, it is important to take into account the derived-category
shifts [j] in the deﬁnitions of the the fractional branes on Xm+2. Recall that the complex E•[j] denotes the
complex E• shifted to the left by j units.

CHAPTER 8. THE CM+2/ZM+2 ORBIFOLDS
150
With these B-branes at hand, we are ready to determine the quiver. The map between Ext
groups and quiver ﬁelds was discussed in §7.2.1. The Ext group elements correspond to the
chain maps between the Koszul resolutions of a pair of these sheaves. A sheaf of the form
i∗F, with F a sheaf on Pm+1, has a Koszul resolution:
0
- F(n + 1)
vµem+2
µ
- F
- i∗F
- 0 ,
(8.20)
where vµ is the O(−m −2) ﬁber coordinate in the chart Uµ. We refer to Appendix A for
an explanation of our notations, and for additional background material that will be used
extensively below.
8.4.1
Quiver ﬁelds
The simplest arrows are the generators of Ext1(Ei+1, Ei). There generators, denoted by φµ
i,i+1,
are elements of ˇC0(Hom1(Ei+1, Ei)) and are explicitly given by the maps:
Ωi+1(n + i + 2)
- Ωi+1(i + 1)
Ωi(n + 1 + i)
ϕµ
?
- Ωi(i)
−ϕµ
?
Here, ϕµ are the global sections of Ω∗(−1), which are computed in Appendix A—see equation
(A.31). Thus, we reproduce the chiral ﬁelds (of vanishing quiver degree) of the quiver:
φµ
i,i+1 ∈Ext1(Ei+1, Ei)
←→
Φ(0;1)
i,i+1 ,
(8.21)
in the fundamental of SU(m + 2).
The generators of Extk(Ei+k, Ei) take a similar form, using the global sections given in
(A.32). The generators lie in the ˇCech cohomology ˇC0(Homk(Ei+k, Ei)) and can be deﬁned

CHAPTER 8. THE CM+2/ZM+2 ORBIFOLDS
151
to be the antisymmetric composition of k generators of Ext1(Ei+1, Ei):
φµ1µ2···µk
i,i+k
= 1
k!φ[µ1
i,i+1 ◦φµ2
i+1,i+2 ◦· · · ◦φµk]
i+k−1,i+k
←→
Φ(k−1;k)
i,i+k
.
(8.22)
As expected, these arrows transform in the k-index antisymmetric representation of SU(m+
2). The B-model computation thus reproduces exactly the arrows of the Cm+2/Zm+2 toric
quiver presented in §8.2.
We now compute the Serre duals of these arrows, which correspond to the conjugate
ﬁelds in the quiver. These computations are useful for determining the superpotential, since
some of the terms might involve conjugate ﬁelds. In the present case, the Serre duals can
also be computed easily starting from the generators of Ext1(E0, Em+1). They are ¯φµ
m+1,0 ∈
ˇCm+1(Hom−m(E0, Em+1)) and given by the maps:
O(m + 2)
- O
Ωm+1(2m + 3)
- Ωm+1(m + 1)
¯ϕµ
?
where the sections ¯ϕµ are given in (A.36). The Serre duals of the other arrows (8.22) can be
found by composition of these maps with φµ
i,i+1. Explicitly, they are given by:
¯φµ1···µm+2−k
i+k,i
= (m + 1 −i −k)!
(m + 2 −k)!i! φ[µ1···µm+1−i−k

Chapter 9
The Y 1,0(Pm) Family
Our second family of singularities is a particular generalization of the conifold singularity
X3 = C0. As we will see, the corresponding graded quivers share some rather interesting
properties with the celebrated Klebanov-Witten quiver that describes D3-branes at C0 [66].
9.1
The toric geometries
There exist very interesting inﬁnite families of CYm+2 singularities given by the real cone over
certain (2m + 3)-real dimensional Sasaki-Einstein manifolds, with explicitly known metrics,
known as Y p,q, with the integers p > 0, 0 ≤q < p and p, q mutually prime [7]:
Xm+2 = C
 Y p,q(Bm)

.
(9.1)
The compact manifold Y p,q can be understood as a certain lens space bundle over a K¨ahler
manifold Bm of complex dimension m. Importantly, C(Y p,q(Bm)) is toric if Bm is a compact
toric variety.
152

CHAPTER 9. THE Y 0,1(PM) FAMILY
153
Here, we will focus on the simplest such example, (p, q) = (1, 0) and Bm = Pm, namely:
Xm+2 = C
 Y 1,0(Pm)

.
(9.2)
The toric diagram of this singularity is given by:
v0 = (0, . . . , 0) ,
v1 = (1, 0, 0, . . . , 0) ,
v2 = (0, 1, 0, . . . , 0) ,
...
vm+1 = (0, 0, . . . , 0, 1) ,
vm+2 = (1, 1, · · · , 1, 1) .
(9.3)
These geometries possess an SU(m+1) isometry, which acts on the toric diagram by permut-
ing the points v1, . . . , vm+1. We then have an SU(m+1) global symmetry in the corresponding
graded quivers.
Note that the points v0, . . . , vm+1 in (9.3) give rise to the toric diagram for Cm+2, which
is then augmented by a single additional point vm+2. It is hence possible to connect the
quivers in this family to the “ﬂat-space” quivers for Cm+2. In §9.3 below, we will study this
connection in detail.
The singularity (9.2) has a single K¨ahler parameter, corresponding to a small resolution
by a Pm:
eXm+2 ∼= Tot
 O(−m) ⊕O(−1) −→Pm
.
(9.4)
We will use this resolution (9.4) to study B-branes in §9.5.
9.2
The graded quivers
Unlike Cm+2 and the Cm+2/Zm+2 orbifolds discussed in §2.1 and §8, determining the Y 1,0(Pm)
quivers requires a more sophisticated approach than dimensional reduction and orbifolding.

CHAPTER 9. THE Y 0,1(PM) FAMILY
154
Instead, it is possible to derive these quivers by combining printing (see §4) and partial
resolution (see §3.2).
First of all, from the normalized volume of the toric diagram, we know that the Y 1,0(Pm)
quiver has m + 1 nodes. 1 In addition, the quivers have an SU(m + 1) global symmetry.
The entire family admits an interesting recursive construction. C(Y 1,0(Pm+1)) can be
obtained by starting from C(Y 1,0(Pm)) and performing printing to produce images of two of
the points in the toric diagram, as follows:
(0, . . . , 0)
→
(0, . . . , 0, 0) + (0, . . . , 0, 1)
(1, . . . , 1)
→
(1, . . . , 1, 0) + (1, . . . , 1, 1)
(9.5)
where the vectors in the ﬁrst column are (m + 1)-dimensional, while the ones in the second
column are (m+2)-dimensional. Next, removing the point (1, . . . , 1, 0) via partial resolution,
produces the toric diagram for C(Y 1,0(Pm+1)). The ﬁeld theory counterparts of these oper-
ations generate the Y 1,0(Pm+1) quivers starting from Y 1,0(Pm). The initial step is Y 1,0(Pm),
which has m + 1 nodes. The printing lift of two points in the toric diagram generates a
quiver with 2m + 2 nodes. The ﬁnal partial resolution corresponds to a higgsing with non-
zero VEVs for m bifundamental chiral ﬁelds, which reduces the number of quiver nodes to
m + 2 and produces the Y 1,0(Pm+1) quiver. Figure 9.1 illustrates this process at the level
of the geometry for the Y 1,0(P1) →Y 1,0(P2) transition. In this case, the intermediate step
corresponds to the so-called H4 theory, which was studied in [1, 67].
We can use the previous method to generate the ﬁrst members of this family, up to
m = 4. This information, combined with the SU(m + 1) global symmetry and a few other
consistency conditions (that we discuss below) is suﬃcient to identify the Y 1,0(Pm) quivers
for arbitrary m. In the following, we ﬁrst present the result of the procedure we just outlined,
and we then explicitly verify that these quiver theories have the correct geometry as their
1It is also easily understood from the B-model on (9.4), since χ(Pm) = m + 1.

rows, which are bifundamental or adjoint depending on whether the two indices are diﬀerent
or the same. Xm,0 and Xi+1,i are chirals (i.e., of quiver degree 0). They are also singlets
under the SU(m + 1) global symmetry. For the rest of the arrows, we use a notation with
two superindices similar to the one of §2.1.1 and §8.2. The ﬁrst integer is the degree of the
ﬁeld. All of these arrows transform in the j-index totally antisymmetric representation of
SU(m + 1). The second integer in the superscript is this j. In (9.6), the numbers over the

CHAPTER 9. THE Y 0,1(PM) FAMILY

arrows indicate the dimension of the corresponding SU(m+1) representations, and the num-
bers below are the degrees. Finally, in (9.6) we have allowed degrees to go over nc−1 =
 m


,
since this permits a more compact presentation of the ﬁeld content. It is straightforward to
restrict to ﬁelds with degree c ≤nc −1 by conjugating arrows whenever necessary.
We introduce the following notation for conjugate ﬁelds, which makes all their quantum
numbers explicit:
(Xm,0)

X0,m ,

=

.
(9.7)
The bifundamental indices are simply ﬂipped. The degree c transforms as c →m−c. Finally
the number j of SU(m + 1) fundamental indices in the totally antisymmetric representation
goes to m + 1 −j. Note that the representations with j and m + 1 −j have the same
dimension and are conjugate to each other, as expected.
Figure 9.2 shows the quivers for 1 ≤m ≤6. In this ﬁgure we adopted the convention in
which the degrees of the ﬁelds, c, are restricted to the range c ≤
 m
2

, as explained in §1.2.
For those ﬁelds in (9.6) with c >
 m
2

, we consider their conjugates. Nodes 0 and m are
identical, up to conjugation of all the ﬁelds in the quiver. The rest of the nodes, 1 to m −1,
are all equivalent.
Let us consider the behavior of these quivers under mutations, which are reviewed in
§1.2.1. Interestingly, node 0 is the only toric node of the quiver for m > 1. By this, we mean
that it is the only node with two incoming chiral arrows, which results in a toric phase when
mutated. Similarly, node 1 is an inverse toric node, i.e. we obtain a toric phase when acting
on it with the inverse mutation. We plan to carry out a more detailed investigation of the
mutations of these quivers in future work.
For m = 1 we have the conifold quiver. In this case, the naive SU(2) global symmetry

CHAPTER 9. THE Y 0,1(PM) FAMILY
157
is enhanced to SU(2) × SU(2), with the two chiral ﬁelds that go from node 1 to node 0
combining to form a doublet of the new SU(2). The m = 2 quiver (with its superpotential)
ﬁrst appeared in the mathematical literature in [54]; see also [68].

Black, red, green and blue arrows

Superpotential.
Let us now consider the superpotential of this family of graded quivers.
To determine it, we will again be guided by the global SU(m + 1) symmetry. As in writing
the superpotential for Cm+2, we deﬁne a product of arrows in which the SU(m + 1) indices

where k = P
i ki and the αµ’s are fundamental SU(m + 1) indices. With this convention,
any such term with a total of m+1 indices is an SU(m+1) invariant. All the superpotential
terms we will write have this property.
The superpotential consists of cubic terms W3 and quartic terms W4. The cubic terms

superpotential of the conifold quiver.
9.2.1
Generalized anomaly cancellation
Let us start by assuming that the ranks of all the nodes are equal to N and check that, in this
case, the quivers we propose satisfy the generalized anomaly-free conditions. We normalize
all the anomalies by N. For node 0 the contribution of the arrows to the anomaly is given
by:

(9.11)
Due to the aforementioned symmetry between nodes 0 and 1, the anomaly for node 1 follows
a very similar computation. For nodes 2 to m the contributions to the anomaly of ﬁelds of
diﬀerent degrees are as follows:

CHAPTER 9. THE Y 0,1(PM) FAMILY
160
Summing these contributions, at node i we have
ai,arrows = 1 + (−1)m .
(9.13)
We conclude that the anomaly cancellation condition is satisﬁed for all nodes in the quiver.
Anomaly-free fractional branes.
Interestingly, there are more general solutions to the
rank assignments that satisfy the anomaly cancellation conditions. A thorough study of
this issue is beyond the scope of this paper, and it will be investigated elsewhere. Here, we
just quote the result and consider some of its implications. The space of anomaly-free rank
assignments for Y 1,0(Pm) is 2-dimensional and can be parametrized as follows:
(N0, . . . , Nm) = N(1, . . . , 1) + M(0, 1, 2, . . . , m) ,
(9.14)
with N and M integers. Borrowing the nomenclature from m ≤3, we will say that the
(1, . . . , 1) vector corresponds to regular branes, while more general ranks correspond to the
inclusion of (anomaly-free) fractional branes. 2 Interestingly, all members of the Y 1,0(Pm)
admit a single type of anomaly-free fractional brane. This behavior generalizes the well-
known example of Y 1,0(P1), i.e. the conifold. It is also reminiscent of what happens for
the inﬁnite family of Y p,q theories in 4d [8], all of which have a single type of anomaly-free
fractional brane.
9.2.2
Kontsevich bracket
With the convention introduced in the previous section, we can write any SU(m+1) invariant
term in the superpotential as A(m−1−c;m+1−k)
i,j
Ψ(c;k)
j,i , with A(m−1−c;m+1−k)
i,j
a monomial and
2This is a standard nomenclature. While it is closely related to our other use of the term fractional brane,
which is a bound state of wrapped branes associated to a single node in the quiver, we are conﬁdent that
the distinction between the two meanings will be clear from the context.

CHAPTER 9. THE Y 0,1(PM) FAMILY

Ψ(c;k)

an individual SU(m + 1) multiplet of arrows. We then have
∂
∂Ψ(c;k)
j,i
= A(m−1−c;m+1−k)

.
(9.15)
As in (8.6), for a cycle A(c;k)
i,j B(d;l)
j,i , with (c;k)
i,j
and B(d;l)
j,i
monomial of arrows, the commutation
relation is

i,j B(d;l)
j,i
= (−1)cd+klB(d;l)
j,i A(c;d)
i,j
.
(9.16)
Since every term in the superpotential has degree m −1 and a total of m + 1 SU(m + 1)
indices, for the superpotential term we wrote above this commutation relation simpliﬁes to
Ai,jΨ(c;k)
j,i
= (−1)m(c+k)Ψ(c;k)

To determine s1, · · · , s7 we ﬁrst note that many of them can be made trivial by ﬁeld redeﬁni-
tions. We can ﬁx s6(k) = 1 by redeﬁning Xk,k−1 →±Xk,k−1 and ﬁx s7(j, k) = 1 by redeﬁning
Γi,i+k →±Γi,i+k. Lastly s1(i, k) can be chosen to be 1 by redeﬁning Λi,i+k →±Λi,i+k. After

eliminating these we ﬁnd that Kontsevich bracket vanishes for the following choice of signs:

s4(i, j, k)

=
(−1)j+m .
(9.20)
9.2.3
Chiral cycles and the moduli space
Knowing the superpotential, we are ready to ﬁnd the chiral cycles for this family. Since
to get them we substitute ﬁelds in the superpotential terms by polynomials with the same
quantum numbers, chiral cycles will arise in SU(m + 1) invariant combinations. The chiral
ﬁelds in the quiver are Xm,0, Xi+1,i and Λ(0;1)
i,i+1. In terms of them, the chiral cycles are:
Λ(0;1)
0,1 X1,0Λ(0;1)
0,1 Λ(0;1)
1,2 · · · Λ(0;1)
m−1,mXm,0
+Λ(0;1)
0,1 Λ(0;1)
1,2 X2,1Λ(0;1)
1,2 · · · Λ(0;1)
m−1,mXm,0
+ · · · + Λ(0;1)
0,1 Λ(0;1)
1,2 · · · Λ(0;1)
m−1,mXm,m−1Λ(0;1)
m−1,mXm,0
(9.21)
Notice that despite every term containing a product of the form Λ(0;1)
i,i+1Xi+1,iΛ(0;1)
i,i+1, none of the
chiral cycles contain the same arrow twice due to the implicit contractions with Levi-Civita
tensors.
Expanding these cycles in terms of the component arrows, every term in (9.21) gives
rise to (m + 1)! chiral cycles.
Since there are m of these terms, we conclude there are
m(m + 1)! chiral cycles. For m = 1 we obtain 2 chiral cycles, which are just the 2 terms in
the superpotential. For m = 2, there are 12 chiral cycles, 2 for each of the J- and E-terms
associated to the 6 Fermis in the quiver.
Since all Λ(0;1)
i,i+1 have a single index, we will drop the superindex (0; 1) and instead write

CHAPTER 9. THE Y 0,1(PM) FAMILY
164
its SU(m + 1) index explicitly. With this, the Grassmann variables and the corresponding
chiral cycles become:
θp
i : Λp(0)
0,1 · · · Λp(i)
i,i+1Xi+1,iΛp(i+1)
i,i+1 Λp(i+2)
i+1,i+2 · · · Λp(m)
m−1,mXm,0 ,
(9.22)
where 1 ≤i ≤m and p runs over the elements of the symmetric group Sm+1 of m + 1
elements {0, · · · , m}. Using them we can write down the Grassmann variables associated to
every chiral ﬁeld, which are given by:
Θ(Xm,0)

Θ(Xi+1,i)

p∈Sm+1;p(i+1)=µ θp

(9.23)
We also need the intersection numbers between chiral ﬁelds and the fundamental cycles
of the torus. We can choose the fundamental cycles such that they are:

Λµ
0,1, γα

= δµ,α
⟨X1,0, γα⟩= 1
(9.24)
We are ready to evaluate the integral to obtain the Newton polynomial of the moduli
space and identify the perfect matchings. We ﬁrst note that:
Θ(Xm,0)Θ(Xi+1,i) = Θ(Λµ
i,i+1)Θ(Xm,0) = 0 .
(9.25)
This is trivially true since Θ(Xm,0) contains all the Grassmann variables. Similarly,
Θ(Xj+1,j)Θ(Λµ
i,i+1) = 0 ,
(9.26)

CHAPTER 9. THE Y 0,1(PM) FAMILY
165
since Θ(Xj+1,j) and Θ(Λµ
i,i+1) have a common factor Q
p∈Sm+1;p(i)=µ θp
j for j ≤i and Q
p∈Sm+1;p(i+1)=µ θp
j
for j ≥i. Also for i < j, Θ(Λµ
i,i+1) and Θ(Λν
j,j+1) have a common factor:
Y
p∈Sm+1;p(i)=µ,p(j)=µ
θp
j .
(9.27)
Note that since p is invertible, the common factor is non-trivial if and only if µ ̸= ν. Hence,
for µ ̸= ν,
Θ(Λµ
i,i+1)Θ(Λν
j,j+1) = 0 .
(9.28)
With these results in mind, the only surviving integrals are:
R Qm
i=1
Q
p∈Sm+1 dθp
i Θ(Xm,0) = 1
R Qm

Partial resolution C(Y 1,0(Pm)) →Cm+2
Let us now consider yet another check of the proposed quiver theories. Removing the point
vm+2 in the toric diagram corresponds to the partial resolution:
C(Y 1,0(Pm)) →Cm+2 .
(9.32)
Figure 9.3 illustrates this resolution for m = 1, 2.
This implies that the graded quivers
associated to these geometries should be connected by higgsing, as we now explain.
Let us determine that chiral ﬁelds that acquire a non-zero VEV in the corresponding

Figure 9.3: C(Y 1,0(Pm)) →Cm+2 partial resolution for m = 1, 2.
From (9.31), we see that these chiral ﬁelds only appear in this perfect matching. This implies
that given VEVs to all the chiral ﬁelds in (9.33) produces the desired partial resolution.
We now consider how this higgsing gives rise to the quivers for Cm+2, which were intro-
duced in §2.1.1. First, the VEVs for the m bifundamental chiral ﬁelds in (9.33) higgs the
m + 1 nodes in the quiver for C(Y 1,0(Pm)) down to a single node, as expected.
Since the isometries of C(Y 1,0(Pm)) and Cm+2 are SU(m+1) and SU(m+2), respectively,
the global symmetry of the quiver theory must be enhanced from SU(m + 1) to SU(m + 2)
by the higgsing. We note that all the chiral ﬁelds in (9.33) are singlets of SU(m + 1), which
implies that the global symmetry would, at the very least, remain unbroken.
It is instructive to consider how the remaining ﬁelds form SU(m + 2) representations. It
is straightforward, albeit tedious, to verify that the massless matter ﬁelds that survive the
higgsing are all the arrows that were initially charged under node 0, except for X0,m. They

(9.34)
We thus have a multiplet of degree k in the k-index totally antisymmetric representation
of SU(m + 1) for every k = 0, . . . , m. The multiplet of degree k and the conjugate of the
multiplet of degree m −k combine to form a degree k ﬁeld in the (k + 1)-index totally
antisymmetric representation of SU(m + 2) for k = 0, . . . m
2 . 3 This is precisely the ﬁeld
content for Cm+2, as discussed in §2.1.1.
9.4
A simple duality cascade
A beautiful property of the Y 1,0(Pm) theories is that they have a single toric phase and that
they enjoy a remarkably simple duality cascade, generalizing the well-known cascade for the
conifold [69]. There is a single toric node, i.e. a node with two incoming chiral ﬁelds, which
is node 0. Similarly, node m is a toric node under inverse duality. A duality on node 0 results
in the same theory, up to a cyclic permutation of the node labels. We will now explain how
this comes about.
Let us ﬁrst consider the “ﬂavors”, namely the arrows charged under node 0.
Upon
mutating node 0, they transform as follows
Xm,0
−−−→
˜X0,m
X1,0
−−−→
˜X0,1
¯Λ(k;k)
m+1−k,0
−−−→
˜Λ(k−1;k)
m+1−k,0
(9.35)
3When m is even, the ﬁeld of degree k = m
2 coincides with the one of degree m −k. We thus obtain only
half a multiplet for k = m
2 , or the full multiplet by combining it with its conjugate.

CHAPTER 9. THE Y 0,1(PM) FAMILY
169
We will use a tilde to indicate the arrows of the mutated quiver. The ﬁelds on the right hand
side of the last two rows reproduce the ﬁelds charged under node m of the original theory
if we relabel nodes as i →i −1 mod (m + 1). This is the ﬁrst indication that eﬀect of the
mutation is a cyclic permutation of nodes.
Next, let us consider the mesons generated by the mutation. There are two sets of them,
coming from compositions with either Xm,0 or X1,0. They are given by
X1,0 Λ(k−1;k)
0,k
−−−→
˜Ψ(k−1;k)
1,k
Xm,0 Λ(k;k+1)
0,k+1
−−−→
˜¯Γ(k;k+1)
m,k+1
(9.36)
All the arrows in the ﬁrst set becomes massive while ˜¯Γ(0;1)
m,1 also gets a mass. The relevant
mass terms in the mutated superpotential and the terms in the original superpotential that
give rise to them are:
Term in the original superpotential
Mass Term
X1,0Λ(m−1;m)
0,m
Xm,0Λ(0;1)
0,1
˜Ψ(m−1;m)
1,m
˜¯Γ(0;1)
m,1
X1,0Λ(k−1;k)
0,k
¯Γ(k−1;k)
k,1
˜Ψ(m−k;m+1−k)
1,k
˜¯Γ(k−1;k)
k,1
(9.37)
After integrating out the massive ﬁelds, the ones that remain and are charged under node
1 are ˜X0,1, ˜X2,1 and ˜Λ(k−1;k)
1,k
. They correspond exactly to the set of arrows at toric node 0
in the original theory. The mesons ˜¯Γ(k−1;k)
m,k+1 for k ̸= m −1 remain massless and are what is
required to turn node m of the mutated quiver into node m −1 of the original one.
Both the degree and representation under SU(m + 1) global symmetry of the arrows not
charged under nodes 0, 1 or m depend uniformly on the distance between the two nodes
the arrow connects. None of these arrows are aﬀected by mutation and relabeling i →i −1
preserves distances.

CHAPTER 9. THE Y 0,1(PM) FAMILY
170
In summary, dualizing node 0, we obtain the original quiver, up to an i →i −1 cyclic
relabeling of the nodes. When the nodes are cyclically ordered as in the examples in Figure
9.2, the net eﬀect of the mutation is a clockwise rotation of the quiver. While we have focused
on the quiver, it is straightforward to verify that we also obtain the original superpotential.
After performing m+1 consecutive dualizations on the toric node at each step, we return
to the initial quiver. This sequence of mutations therefore generalizes the notion of duality
cascade to m-graded quivers.

Figure 9.4: a) Quiver diagram for Y 1,0(P4). b) Result of the mutation on node 0. Massive
ﬁelds are represented by dashed arrows. c) After integrating out massive ﬁelds, we obtain
the original quiver, up to an i →i −1 cyclic relabeling of the nodes. This translates into a
clockwise rotation of the quiver.
Figure 9.4 shows the transformation of the quiver for m = 4. The intermediate step
includes the massive ﬁelds, which are represented by dashed arrows. Figure 9.5 shows a
period in the cascade for m = 4. We have included the ranks of the gauge groups associated
to the nodes, in the presence of fractional branes, to follow their evolution. Interestingly,
as it occurs in the well-known conifold cascade, the number of regular branes increases by
1 with every dualization while the number of fractional branes remains ﬁxed. A full period
hence returns to the original quiver with the regular branes increased by (m + 1)M. For
m = 1, duality cascades admit a renormalization group interpretation. In that context, our
choice of dualities corresponds to ﬂowing towards the UV. The ﬂow towards the IR, and
the consequent decrease in the number of regular branes, is instead obtained by acting with

B-model computation
The B-model calculation of the graded quivers with superpotentials for the Y 1,0(Pm) family
is similar to the one in section 8.4, with the notation of Appendix A. The resolved local

CHAPTER 9. THE Y 0,1(PM) FAMILY
172
Calabi-Yau for this family is:
eXm+2 = Tot(O(−m) ⊕O(−1) →Pm) .
(9.38)
Fractional branes are constructed from the exceptional collection on Pm, given by (8.18)
(with m + 1 replaced by m), by using the embedding i : Pm →eXm+2. They are:


.
(9.39)
To compute the generators of the Ext groups, we need the Koszul resolution for the fractional
branes. It is given by:

Here, vµ is the coordinate of O(−m) ﬁber and uµ is the coordinate of O(−1) ﬁber.

Quiver
The Ext group generators for these fractional branes naturally split into three groups and an
additional generator, in obvious correspondence with the ﬁeld content independently derived
in (9.6).
First group.
The ﬁrst group has a description very similar to the generators in the case
of Cm+2/Zm+2. They can be written as the antisymmetric composition of certain basic Ext1

transform in the k-index antisymmetric representation of SU(m + 1). The basic
generators λµ
i,i+1, which transform in the fundamental representation of the global SU(m+1)
symmetry, are given by the chain map
Ωi+1(m + i + 2)
- Ωi+1(m + i + 1) ⊕Ωi+1(i + 2)

Again, ϕµ are the global sections of Ω∗(−1) from (A.31). The Serre duals of these generators
are determined along the familiar lines. They are

Second group.
The second group corresponds to the generators of ˇC1(Hom0(Ei, Ei+1)).
There is a set of generators xi+1,i. They are singlets under SU(m + 1) deﬁned by the chain
maps
Ωi(m + i + 1)
- Ωi(m + i) ⊕Ωi(i + 1)
- Ωi(i)

where x ∈ˇC1(Ω). This means that locally for each Uµ ∩Uν there is one form xµν and this
collection satisﬁes that for any µ, ν and ρ
x′
µν + x′
νρ + x′
ρµ = 0 .
(9.42)
Using (A.28), it can be veriﬁed that an explicit representative of this cohomology class is
x′
0,i = w−1
0,i dw0,i ,
x′
i,j = w−1
i,i dwi,i −w−1
j,j dwj,j .
(9.43)
Third group.
With this in hand, the third set of Ext generators is
γµ1µ2···µk+1

γµ1µ2···µk+1
i,i+k

i−1,i+k
.
(9.44)
Motivated by the computation of ¯λ presented above, in order to calculate the Serre duals of
these arrows we start with the generators of Ext2(E1, Em−1). These generators are ¯γµν
m−1,1 ∈

ˇCm−1(Hom3−m(E1, Em−1)) and are described by the chain map
Ω(m + 2)

ansatz
¯rµν = 1

(9.45)
We observe that ¯rµν ∈ˇCm−1(Ωm−2 ⊗O(−2)) iﬀκ ∈ˇCm−1(Ωm). Such a κ corresponds to a
local section of Ωm for every collection of m patches satisfying that for ∩µUµ

A lone generator.
In addition to these three groups, there is another generator xm,0. It
consists of the following map in ˇCm(Hom1−m(Em, E0)):
O(m + 1)

- O(1)

Proceeding along lines similar to the ones that result in (A.36), we see that an explicit
representative for ˜x is:
˜x = ∧iw−1
0,i dw0,i .
(9.50)
In summary, the x, λ and γ generators correspond precisely to the X, Λ and Γ ﬁelds in (9.6).
We have thus recovered the quivers for the entire Y 1,0(Pm) from the B-model.
9.5.2
Superpotential
Cubic terms.
Since we have deﬁned Ext generators as composition of simpler ones, it is
straightforward to determine most of the m2 products. For these pairs of generators, the f2

vanish. We will mention a few of them here:
m2(λµ1µ2···µk

, λµk+2···µk+l+1
j,j+l
) = δi+k,jγµ1···µk+l+1
i,i+k+l
.
(9.51)
Evaluation of m2(λµ1···µk
i,i+k , xj,j−1) is slightly more involved. We begin by pointing out a com-
mutation relation:
ϕµ ◦x′ + x′ ◦ϕµ = δ˜πµ ,
(9.52)
where the sheaf πµ is deﬁned to be the element of ˇC0(O(−1)) such that:
(˜πµ)ν = δµ
ν eν .
(9.53)
At the level of Ext generators, this commutation relation gives rise to the relation:
λµ
i,i+1 ◦xi+1,i = δπµ
i,i + Xi,i−1 ◦λµ
i−1,i, ,
(9.54)
where πµ is deﬁned by the chain map:
Ωi(m + i + 1)
- Ωi(m + i) ⊕Ωi(i + 1)
- Ωi(i)
Ωi(m + i + 1)






?
The ﬁrst term in (9.54) is exact in ˇCech cohomology and contributes to f2 while the second
term is another generator and hence corresponds to m2.

CHAPTER 9. THE Y 0,1(PM) FAMILY
178
Composing the above relation with more λ’s give us:
λµ1···µk
i,i+k
◦xi,i+k−1 = xi,i−1 ◦λµ1···µk
i−1,i+k−1 +
1
(k −1)!δ(π[µ1
i,i ◦λµ2···µk]
i,i+k−1) .
(9.55)
The right hand side is again in a form that allows us to read oﬀm2 and f2. We obtain:
m2(λµ1···µk
i,i+k , xi+k,i+k−1) = γµ1···µk
i,i+k−1 ,
f2(λµ1···µk
i,i+k , xi+k,i+k−1) = −
1
(k −1)!π[µ1
i,i ◦λµ2···µk]
i,i+k−1 .
(9.56)
Using γ’s deﬁnition composition in (9.44) and composing (9.55) with λµ’s on the right results
in:
m2(λµ1···µk
i,i+k , γ
µk+1···µk+j+1

(9.57)
This completes the reproduction of the cubic terms for this family, which were previously
given in (9.9).
Quartic terms.
To compute the quartic terms we need another set of non-vanishing f2.
These result from the composition of xm,0 with λ0,k. We start with:
xm,0 ◦λµ

(9.59)
Composing λµ2···µk

with (9.58) and doing a bit of algebra gives:
m2(xm,0, λ0,k) = 0 ,
f2(xm,0, λ0,k) = −1

This gives us all the quartic terms in the superpotential. At this point we note that although
f3 is nontrivial, using consideration of global symmetry and the degree constraint mentioned
earlier it can be shown that it cannot result in any additional terms in the superpotential.
Hence the quartic terms agree with the ones we wrote for graded quiver.
Absence of higher order terms.
In principle, we should continue the computations
to determine whether the superpotential contains higher order terms. These terms would
correspond to gauge invariants of order m −1. It is a relatively straightforward exercise to
verify that the SU(m + 1) × U(1)m+1 global symmetry, whose existence follows from the
underlying CY geometry and which is already ﬁxed by the previously computed cubic and
quartic terms in the superpotential, rules out any higher order term.
Summarizing the results in this section, we have recovered the superpotential for the
entire Y 1,0(Pm) family, which was given in (9.9) and (9.10).

The F (m)
0
Family
Our last class of examples is a family of geometries that we denote F (m)
0
, which correspond
to the aﬃne cones over the (P1)m+1, a direct product of m + 1 P1’s.
10.1
The toric geometries
The toric diagram for F (m)
0
is the (m + 1)-dimensional polytope consisting of the following
points.
(0, . . . , 0)
(±1, 0, . . . , 0)
...
(0, . . . , 0, ±1)
(10.1)
These geometries have an SU(2)m+1 isometry, which translates into a global symmetry of
the corresponding quiver theories. The Newton polynomials contain 2m + 3 terms, of which
m + 2 can be scaled to 1. The remaining m + 1 coeﬃcients encode the sizes of the P1’s. The
behavior of the mirror geometry as a function of these coeﬃcients was studied in detail for
m = 1, 2 in [39].

Figure 10.1: Toric diagrams for F (m)

with m = 0, 1, 2.
This is an extremely interesting family of geometries because, contrary to the previous
classes of theories, for m > 0 they give rise to multiple toric phases related by the corre-
sponding order m + 1 dualities. The m = 1 [23] and 2 [1, 33, 39] cases have been extensively
studied in the literature. In particular, F (1)
0
has 2 toric phases and F (2)
0
has 14 toric phases.
10.2
The graded quivers
A simple way of constructing a toric phase for each of these geometries by using products
iteratively was outlined in (5.30). We now study these quivers in detail. The quiver for F (m)
0
has 2m+1 nodes. This is also clear from the toric diagram, which doubles its normalized
volume every time m is increased by 1, as well as from the fact that χ((P1)m+1) = 2m+1. For
later use, it is convenient to label the nodes using (m + 1)-dimensional vectors with 0 or 1
entries, i.e. in binary.

Quiver.
The quiver is constructed as follows. Consider two nodes α and β labeled by
vectors ⃗α and ⃗β. Let us deﬁne
dαβ =
m+1
X
i=1
(βi −αi) .
(10.3)
Then:
• There is an arrow from α to β iﬀdαβ > 0, i.e. iﬀβi ≥αi for all 1 ≤i ≤m + 1.
• The degree of the arrow is
c = dαβ −1 .
(10.4)
• The multiplicity of the arrow is 2c+1. More speciﬁcally, the arrow represents 2c+1 ﬁelds
that transform in the
2β1−α1

× 2β2−α2
2
× . . . × 2βm+1−αm+1
m+1
(10.5)
representation of the SU(2)m+1 global symmetry, where the subindices run over the
diﬀerent SU(2) factors.
As usual, we can restrict to ﬁelds with c ≤m
2 by conjugating the arrows with c > m
2 .
Superpotential.
As for the Cm+2/Zm+2 family, it is possible to show the construction of
these models via iterative orbifold reduction implies that all the terms in the superpotential
are cubic. The superpotential terms are given by cubic terms of degree m −1 combined into
SU(2)m+1 invariants. Once again, it is possible to show that terms for all possible integer
partitions of m −1 into three integers are present. In fact we can regard the purely cubic
superpotential as the characteristic property of the speciﬁc toric phases of F (m)
0
that we
construct.
Let us be more explicit about the superpotential for the F (m)
0
family. From our previous
discussion of the ﬁeld content, there is an arrow connecting nodes i and j whenever dij ̸= 0.

CHAPTER 10. THE F (M)
0
FAMILY
184
We will consider the arrow Xij which has dij > 0 as the ﬁeld while we will write Xji for its
conjugate. 1 It is also useful to deﬁne a partial ordering relation ≻between two nodes by
j ≻i iﬀdij > 0.
The superpotential can then be written as
W =
X
i
X
j≻i
X
k≻j
s(i, j, k)XijXjk ¯Xki ,
(10.6)
where we omit SU(2)m+1 indices and their contractions, and the s(i, j, k) are signs that are
necessary for the vanishing of {W, W}. According to (10.4), Xij has degree dij −1, Xjk has
degree djk −1 and ¯Xki has degree m + 1 −dik. Gauge invariance implies that dik = dij + djk,
which in turn implies that the degree of any such term is equal to m −1 and it is hence
present in the superpotential.
Periodic quivers
Arguably the simplest representation of theories in the F (m)
0
family is in terms of periodic
quivers on Tm+1. We can imagine the unit cell has length 2 in every direction and the vector
labels we just discussed give the positions of the nodes. Pairs of chiral ﬁelds aligned with the
ith direction are the SU(2)i doublets connecting these nodes. These hypercubic structure is
completed with additional arrows that form degree m −1 triangles representing the cubic
terms in the superpotential.
1Note the convention we use for this argument is not the usual one in which we restrict to degrees c ≤m
2 .
For example the arrow directed from (1, 1, · · · , 1) to (0, 0, · · · , 0) is a chiral but in this notation it will be
written as the conjugate of X(0,0,··· ,0),(1,1,··· ,1).

10.2.1
Generalized anomaly cancellation
Let us restrict to the case in which all gauge groups have rank N. Let i be a node having k
entries which are zero, in the binary notation. Then, normalizing by N, the contribution of
the arrows to the anomaly at node i is:

(10.7)
Thus, the anomaly-free condition is satisﬁed.
10.2.2
Kontsevich bracket
Now we will show that {W, W} = 0 when the coeﬃcients in the superpotential are chosen to
be s(i, j, k) = (−1)d(i,j)+m d(i,k). First we make a preliminary comment about the way indices
are contracted in the superpotential using the SU(2) invariant tensor ϵµν. Note that for any
term in the superpotential one of these indices will always be contracted with a barred ﬁeld
and the other one with an unbarred ﬁeld. Even though we do not show these indices in the
interest of a clean notation, we will stick to a convention in which the ﬁrst index contracts
with the unbarred ﬁeld and the second one with barred ﬁeld. Tiptoeing this convention, in
the expressions below the ﬁrst index of the implicit ϵµν is free for the derivatives with respect
to unbarred ﬁelds, while the second index is free for the derivatives with respect to barred
ﬁelds.

d(i, j) + d(j, k) + d(i, k) = 0
⇒
cij + cjk + cik = 1 .
(10.9)
Using the fact that cij(cij + 1) = 0 mod 2 for any i, j we get
(−1)clk(cli+cik) = (−1)cik(ckl+cil) = 1 .

Simplifying this expression using the mod 2 relations above, we conclude that {W, W} = 0.
10.3
Moduli space
We are ready to explore how perfect matchings give rise to the F (m)
0
moduli space. Instead
of using the Grassmann integral, it is more convenient to divide the perfect matchings ac-

CHAPTER 10. THE F (M)

FAMILY
187
cording to their behavior under global symmetry and directly use the deﬁnition of perfect
matchings. Using this approach provide explicit expressions for the perfect matchings and
their multiplicity.
Central perfect matchings and Dedekind numbers
Let us ﬁrst focus on the central point of the toric diagram (10.1). Since this point is invariant
under the global symmetry, the perfect matchings corresponding to it must contain complete
representations of SU(2)m+1. One such perfect matching is immediately evident from the
superpotential (10.6). It consists of all the arrows
p0 = { ¯Xij|i ≻j} .
(10.12)
The chiral ﬁelds in this perfect matching are in ¯X(1,··· ,1),(0,··· ,0) which has dimension 2m+1 and
transforms as 21 × · · · × 2m+1. In the examples of quiver show in Figure 10.2, Figure 10.3,
Figure 10.4 these are the conjugate of the dotted arrows.
This is not the only perfect matching associated to the central point. The multiplicity of
perfect matchings corresponding to it rapidly grows with m. For example, it is known that
for the phases under consideration the perfect matching multiplicity of the central point is
2 for F (0)
0 , 5 for F (1)
0
and 19 for F (2)
0 .
The central perfect matchings can be elegantly classiﬁed in terms of Boolean functions. A
Boolean function of m + 1 variables is a function f : {0, 1}m+1 →{0, 1}. For us, the domain
of f corresponds to the nodes of F (0)(m), which have a partial ordering ≻.
A Boolean
function f is monotonically increasing if for any i with f(i) = 1 we also have f(j) = 1 for
all j ≻i.2
Given a monotonically increasing Boolean function f, we deﬁne a collection of ﬁelds ˜pf
2Notice that this deﬁnition includes the constant functions f = 0 and f = 1.

CHAPTER 10. THE F (M)
0
FAMILY
188
as follows:
˜pf = {Xij|f(i) = 0 and f(j) = 1} .
(10.13)
Using ˜pf we deﬁne:
pf = ˜p ∪{ ¯Xji|Xij /∈˜pf} .
(10.14)
Let us now show that pf is indeed a perfect matching. By its deﬁnition, for every arrow
pf contains either the arrow or its conjugate. Given the superpotential (10.6), in order to
show that it is a perfect matching we need to verify that for every k ≻j ≻i, pf contains
exactly one of Xij, Xjk or ¯Xki. We proceed as follows:
1. Let us suppose that Xij ∈pf. Then f(j) = 1, which implies that Xjk /∈pf. Also
f(i) = 0 and since k ≻j and f is monotonic then f(k) = 1. Therefore Xik ∈pf, which
means that ¯Xki /∈pf.
2. Next we consider the case when Xjk ∈pf. This means that f(j) = 0 and f(k) = 1 and
since j ≻i then f(i) = 0. Then, Xij /∈pf. Also Xik ∈pf, which means that ¯Xki /∈pf.
3. Finally, we consider the case when neither Xij nor Xjk are in pf. Here we further
divide the problem into two subcases:
(a) f(k) = 1. Since Xjk /∈pf then f(j) = 1, which in turn means that f(i) = 1 since
Xij /∈pf. Hence, Xik /∈pf, which means that ¯Xki ∈pf.
(b) f(k) = 0. Since k ≻j ≻i, monotonicity means that f(i) = f(j) = 0. Hence
Xik /∈pf, which means that ¯Xki ∈pf.
This completes the proof of our assertion that pf is a perfect matching.
Next we show that if f is not a constant function and pf = pg, then f = g. For this we
ﬁrst note that for any non-constant monotonic function f(0, · · · , 0) = 0 and f(1, · · · , 1) = 1.
If f and g are distinct they diﬀer at some argument i. Without loss of generality, we assume

CHAPTER 10. THE F (M)
0
FAMILY
189
that f(i) = 0 and g(i) = 1. This means that Xi,(1,··· ,1) ∈pf but Xi,(1,··· ,1) /∈pg. Hence pf and
pg are also distinct.
Both the constant functions f = 0 and f = 1 are monotonic and for both of them ˜pf is
empty and hence they determine the same perfect matching, which is precisely the p0 deﬁned
in (10.12).
Going in the opposite direction, we want to prove that all the central perfect matchings
for F (m)
0
are determined by increasing Boolean functions. This can be achieved by assigning
to every central perfect matching p a monotonic Boolean function fp such that:
pfp = p .
(10.15)
Let us deﬁne fp as follows:
fp(j) = 1 ⇔there exists an i such that j ≻i and Xij ∈p .
(10.16)
We start by showing that fp is monotonically increasing. Assuming fp(j) = 1 then there
exists an i such that Xij ∈p. For every k ≻j there is a term in the superpotential:
XijXjk ¯Xki .
(10.17)
This means that ¯Xki /∈p, which in turn means Xik ∈p. Hence fp(k) = 1 and fp is monotonic.
To prove (10.15) we need to show that if Xij ∈p then fp(i) = 0. Let us suppose that
this is not the case and fp(i) = 1. By the deﬁnition of fp, there is some l such that Xli ∈p.
Consider the term in the superpotential:
XliXij ¯Xjl .
(10.18)

CHAPTER 10. THE F (M)
0
FAMILY
190
Since Xij ∈p, we must have Xli /∈p which leads to a contradiction. Hence fp(i) = 0. This
completes our determination of the central perfect matchings.
It is clear that all these perfect matchings correspond to the central point of the toric dia-
gram of F (m)
0
, since the Xij’s (and their conjugates) represent full SU(2)m+1 representations.
The same conclusion is obtained by computing intersection numbers with the fundamental
cycles.
The integer sequence M(n) of the numbers of monotonically increasing Boolean functions
is known as Dedekind numbers. The multiplicity of central perfect matchings is then:
# central pm’s of F m
0 = M(m + 1) −1 ,
(10.19)
where we have taken into account the fact that the two constant functions map to p0.
Dedekind numbers grow very quickly and only the values for 0 ≤n ≤8 are known explicitly
[70]. Combined with (10.19), they give rise to the following multiplicities:

ities for m > 2 are new predictions.

Corner perfect matchings
Next let us consider the corners of the toric diagram (10.1), for which xµ = ±1 and all the
other coordinates are zero. SU(2)µ transforms these two points into one another, so picking
one of them breaks SU(2)µ down to U(1) × U(1). We need to consider how a representation
Xij of SU(2)m+1 splits under this reduced symmetry. There are two possibilities:
• iµ = jµ. In this case the original multiplet transforms trivially under SU(2)µ and
remains intact. The same is true for its conjugate.
• jµ −iµ = 1. In this case Xij splits into two multiplets: X+
ij and X−
ij both of which
transform as

jµ+1−iµ+1

(10.21)
under the remaining SU(2)m.
We again make all the quantum numbers explicit so that the conjugate of X+
ij is ¯X−
ji.
The superpotential also splits into two parts
W = W0 + W+−.
(10.22)
W0 consists of terms which contain no arrows charged under SU(2)µ. W+−consist of terms
with two arrows charged under SU(2)µ, one barred and the other one unbarred. Under the
reduced symmetry such a term splits as
XijXjk ¯Xki →X+

With this, it is straightforward to verify that the following collection p+
µ of arrows is a perfect
matching:
• If jµ −iµ = 1, then p+
µ contains X+
ij and the conjugate of X−
ij, i.e. ¯X+
ji. These arrows
cover every term in W+−exactly once and do not cover any term in W0.
• If jµ −iµ = 0, then p−
µ contains ¯Xji. These arrows cover every term in W0 exactly once
and do not cover any term in W+−.
Above we have assumed that j ≻i, which is the condition for the existence of an arrow
between i and j.
p+
µ is the perfect matching which corresponds to xµ = 1. The chiral content of this perfect
matching is then:
p+

(10.24)
Similarly, the perfect matching corresponding to xµ = −1, which we denote p−
µ , is the
following collection of arrows:
• If jµ −iµ = 1, then p−
µ contains X−
ij and the conjugate of X+
ij i.e ¯X−
ji.
• If jµ −iµ = 0, then p−
µ contains ¯Xji.
The chiral content of this perfect matching is:

× C partial resolution
The underlying geometry implies that there exists an interesting connection between consec-
utive members of this family of quiver theories. Removing any corner of the toric diagram
for F (m)

results in the toric diagram for F (m−1)

plus an additional point. This operation corresponds to the following partial resolution
F (m)

(10.28)
Figure 10.5 illustrates this process in the cases of F (1)

and F (2)

as starting points. As we
now explain, at the level of the quiver such a partial resolution translates into a higgsing
from F (m)
0
to the dimensional reduction of the F (m−1)
0
theory.
It is convenient to recall the geometric origin of the SU(2)m+1 global symmetry. The
toric diagram for F (m)
0
, which is given by (10.1), is (m + 1)-dimensional and contains 2m+1
corners. There is a pair of opposite corners for each direction xµ, µ = 1, . . . , m + 1, which
in turn corresponds to the SU(2)µ factor of the global symmetry. In Figure 10.5, we have
indicated the correspondence between pairs of corners and global symmetry factors.
Without loss of generality, let us consider removing p−
m+1 (removing any of the other
corners is equivalent by symmetry).
Partial resolution maps to a higgsing of the quiver
theory. Based on general considerations, it is natural to expect that deleting this corner
corresponds to giving non-zero VEVs to the 2m chiral ﬁelds X−
(a1,...,am,0)(a1,...,am,1). Below we
discuss how this expectation turns out to be correct.

Global symmetry.
Since we give VEVs to ﬁelds that transform exclusively in the 2m+1
representation, we have the following pattern of global symmetry breaking
SU(2)1 × . . . × SU(2)m × SU(2)m+1 →SU(2)1 × . . . × SU(2)m ,
(10.29)
namely the SU(2)m+2 factor disappears. This is in precise agreement with the geometric
expectation.
Quiver.
The 2m VEVs for bifundamental chirals reduce the number of gauge groups to
a half as follows. The VEV for X−
(a1,...,am,0)(a1,...,am,1) higgses the gauge symmetry associated
to nodes (a1, . . . , am, 0) and (a1, . . . , am, 1) to the diagonal subgroup. The corresponding
recombined nodes can be naturally identiﬁed by the remaining labels, i.e. by the vectors

CHAPTER 10. THE F (M)

FAMILY
199
(a1, . . . , am). We thus have
(a1, . . . , am, 0) × (a1, . . . , am, 1) →(a1, . . . , am) .
(10.30)
The change in the number of gauge groups is in agreement with the fact that the volume of
the toric diagram is halved by this particular partial resolution.
Let us now study the matter content of the resulting quiver. All ﬁelds which are singlets
of SU(2)m+1 survive in the ﬁnal theory. These ﬁelds, now connecting the recombined nodes,
give exactly the matter content of F (m−1)
0
.
Next, let us consider the ﬁelds that transform as doublets of SU(2)m+1 (and maybe
doublets of additional SU(2)µ factors). First, the chiral ﬁelds X+
(a1,...,am,0)(a1,...,am,1), which
form SU(2)m+1 doublets with the chiral ﬁelds acquiring VEVs, survive in the ﬁnal theory.
Originally transforming in bifundamental representations, they turn into adjoints of the
corresponding recombined nodes (a1, . . . , am). We can interpret such adjoint chiral ﬁelds as
the ones arising from the dimensional reduction of vector multiplets.
Finally, combining the cubic superpotential (10.6) with the VEVs for the ﬁelds X+
(a1,...,am,0)(a1,...,am,1)
gives rise to masses for all other X−ﬁelds, where the superindex refers to just the SU(2)m+1
quantum number, so they can be integrated out. The associated X+ ﬁelds remain mass-
less and give rise to a copy of the matter content for F (m−1)
0
, but with the degrees of ﬁelds
increased by 1.
Summarizing the previous discussion, the ﬁnal quiver corresponds to the dimensional
reduction of F (m−1)
0
, as expected from the geometry. It is also straightforward to verify that
this process generates the desired superpotential.
Perfect matchings.
From §10.3, we see that the only corner perfect matching that con-
tains chiral ﬁelds acquiring a VEV is p−
m+1. This implies that the proposed set of VEVs

CHAPTER 10. THE F (M)

FAMILY
200
precisely remove the corner associated to p−
m+1, while all the others remain. It is also pos-
sible to verify that some of the perfect matchings at the origin of the toric diagram are
removed, while others survive. In summary, the proposed higgsing exactly produces the
desired partial resolution.
10.6
B-model computation
The computations for this family follow the same pattern as in previous examples. We start
with the resolution of these singularities as the total space of the canonical line bundle over
(P1)m+1. It is given by:
eXm+2 = Tot(O(−2, −2, · · · , −2) →P1
1 × P1
2 × · · · × P1
m+1) .
(10.31)
For m = 0, this coincides with the resolution O(−2) →P1 of C2/Z2, which we discussed in
§8.4. Since for P1, O(−2) ∼= Ω, the exceptional collection on P1 reads:
{E1 ≡O(−1)[1] , E0 ≡O} .
(10.32)
An exceptional collection on (P1)m+1 has 2m+1 elements, which are the line bundles:

Ei ≡Ei1 ⊗Ei2 ⊗· · · ⊗Eim+1
 iµ ∈{0, 1}
	
.
(10.33)
Here, the index i is a binary vector of length m+1. The sheaves in the exceptional collection
on eXm+2 are then of the form:
Fi ≡i∗Ei ,
(10.34)
with the embedding i : (P1)m+1 →eXm+2.
The next step is to ﬁnd the Koszul resolution of these sheaves. The Koszul resolution

CHAPTER 10. THE F (M)

for m = 0 is the same as Koszul resolution for m = 0 in (8.20). For general m, the Koszul
resolution is given by: 3

ω

Basic case: m = 0.
To compute the generator of Ext groups, it is useful to start from

Here, zs correspond to the global sections of O(1) and, as explained earlier, the global
sections of O(p) are determined by homogeneous polynomials of degree p in the homogeneous
coordinate. Labeling the homogeneous coordinates of P1 by z±, we see that each of them
gives rise to a generator y±
0,1, which together transform in the fundamental representation of
the SU(2) global symmetry.

General m.
It is straightforward to determine the quiver for general m, using the informa-
tion we gained for the m = 0 case. Given a pair of fractional branes Fi and Fj, we consider
the following chain maps xs
i,j
O(−j1 + 2, · · · , −jm+1 + 2)
- O(−j1, · · · , −jm+1)
O(−i1 + 2, · · · , −im+1 + 2)

- O(−i1, · · · , −im+1)
Qm
µ=1(−1)jµ−iµξsµ
µ

where ξsµ
µ is a global section of O(jµ −iµ). Hence, we can divide the (Fi, Fj) pairs into two
cases:
1. There exists a µ such that jµ = 0 and iµ = 1. In this case, ξsµ
µ must be a global section
of O(−1) over the µth P1. Since O(−1) has no global sections, Extc(Fj, Fi) is empty
for all c.
2. jµ ≥iµ for all µ. In this case, the ξsµ
µ fall into two classes:
(2.a) If jµ = iµ, then ξsµ
µ is a local section of O, so there is only one possibility for it
i.e. 1.
(2.b) If jµ = 1 and iµ = 0, then ξsµ
µ
is a global section of O(1). In this case, there
are two possibilities for it: z±
µ , i.e. the two homogeneous coordinates of P1
µ. This
also means that xs
i,j transforms in the fundamental representation of the SU(2)µ
factor of the global symmetry.
Combining (2.a) and (2.b), we conclude that xs ∈ˇC0(Homk(Fi, Fj)) with k = P
µ(jµ−
iµ). There are 2k+1 of these generators.
This completes our derivation of the quiver, which is in perfect agreement with the one
found in §10.2 using generalized orbifold reduction.

Finally, let us compute the Serre duals ¯xt
j,i of these arrows. They are given by the chain
maps:
O(−i1 + 2, · · · , −im+1 + 2)
- O(−i1, · · · , −im+1)
O(−j1 + 2, · · · , −jm+1 + 2)
- O(−j1, · · · , −jm+1)
Qm+1
µ=1 ¯ξtµ

As is occurs for ξsµ
µ , ¯ξtµ
µ only exist for jµ ≥iµ and we will need to deal with the corresponding
two cases separately:
(a) If jµ = iµ then ¯ξtµ
µ ∈ˇC1(O(−2)), so the only possibility is ¯z0
µ. The ¯z0 is given in (10.39)
and the subscript indicates that the base is P1
µ.
(b) If jµ = 1 and iµ = 0, then ¯ξtµ
µ ∈ˇC1(O(−3)) and there are two possibilities, namely
¯ξ±
µ = ¯z±
µ . Again the subscript indicates that the base is P1
µ with ¯z± deﬁned in (10.38).
Hence ¯xt
j,i ∈ˇCm+1(Hom1−k(Fi, Fj)) and they are indeed the Serre duals of ¯xs
i,j.
10.6.2
Superpotential
The cubic superpotential terms follow straightforwardly from the composition. Following
our deﬁnition of xs
i,j and xt
j,k and composing them results in:
m2(xs
i,j, xt
j,k) = xs t
i,k .
(10.40)
Here the s t in the superscript means that the fundamental SU(2) indices of xi,j and xj,k are
concatenated. Since the f2’s are all trivially zero, there are no higher products. We then
reproduce the superpotential (10.6).

Chapter 11
Conclusions
In this thesis we have used the language of graded quivers with superpotentials to study
gauge theories arising on the worldvolume of D(5−2m) branes probing CY (m+2) folds for
m = 0, · · · , 3. For this purpose we introduced m-dimers, which fully encode the m-graded
quivers and their superpotentials, in the case in which the CY (m + 2)-folds are toric. The
basic ideas of this correspondence were previously outlined in [2, 31, 39, 41]. Remarkably, as
it has been extensively studied for m = 1, 2, m-dimers signiﬁcantly simplify the connection
between geometry and m-graded quivers. A key result of this paper is the generalization
of the concept of perfect matching, which plays a central role in this map, to arbitrary
m. We provided two alternative deﬁnitions of perfect matchings, which are based on the
superpotential §2.2.1 and on chiral cycles §6.3.1.
We studied the m-dimers associated Cm+2, which are elegantly given by (m+2)-permutohedron
bricks. The dimers for any other toric CYm+2 can be constructed from orbifolds of Cm+2,
which are simply given by stacking multiple permutohedra, via partial resolution. We can
thus regard this class of dimers as a universal parent theory in any dimension.
Although in principal possible the task of constructing a given dimer model by partial
resolution can be computationally challenging. We also presented two algorithms that over-
205

CHAPTER 11. CONCLUSIONS
206
come this challenge for a large class of geometries.
Instead of embedding it in a larger
orbifold, these geometries construct the desired geometry by relating it to simpler geome-
tries with lower m. The ﬁrst of these called printing is a generalization of 3d printing [1] to
arbitrary m. It can be used to construct m+1-dimers from m-dimers. The second algorithm
called products allows us to construct m + n + 1-dimers from an m-dimers and an n-dimers.
Not only do these algorithms allow us to construct complicated dimers using simpler dimers
which are have been studied extensively, they do so in a manner that allows to use the
lessons and intuitions we have gathered by studying m = 0, 1, 2-dimer models for taming the
complexity of dimers with higher m.
We also introduced various simpliﬁed methods for computing perfect matchings and the
corresponding toric diagrams, culminating in the Grassmann integral given in (6.16). This
algorithm considerably supersedes the direct application of the perfect matching deﬁnition
and provides a generalization of the Kasteleyn matrix approach to arbitrary m. In order
to illustrate these ideas, we applied them to the F (m)
0
and Y 1,0(Pm) inﬁnite families of
singularities and to abelian orbifolds of Cm+2. In all these cases, we obtained new results
about the perfect matchings, which provide a more complete picture of the map between
quivers and geometry.
Exploiting these tools, we derived novel combinatorial results for singularities at arbitrary
m.
For the F (m)
0
family, we showed that the number of perfect matchings is related to
Dedekind numbers. For CY 3-folds, the behavior of perfect matching multiplicities under
Seiberg dualities connecting diﬀerent toric phases is controlled by cluster transformations. It
is tempting to conjecture that a generalization of cluster algebras [71] based on the mutations
of m-graded quivers exist. If so, the combinatorics of perfect matchings might provide a useful
handle for elucidating them.
We also treat the problem of the physical signiﬁcance of m-graded quivers for m > 3.
Naively, it may seem that it is physically impossible to go beyond m = 3, since it would

CHAPTER 11. CONCLUSIONS
207
require the gauge theory to live below 0d and the CYm+2 to go beyond the critical dimension
of Type IIB string theory. In this work we have shown that m-graded quivers describe the
open string sector of the topological B-model on CY (m+2)-folds, for any m. We illustrated
this correspondence with the help of three inﬁnite families described above. For each for
the three families we derived a quiver and superpotential from the B-model that matched
precisely with that obtained from the corresponding dimer models.
Our results provide the ﬁrst explicit examples of m-graded quivers with superpotentials
for CY (m+2)-folds with m > 4. Previously, only a few orbifold examples had been presented
for m = 4 [31] and m = 3 [30, 40, 72, 73]. Quivers for more general geometries were studied
only up to m = 2, both in physics and mathematics.
Outlook
Like almost every work of research, this thesis is incomplete in the sense that it
contains seeds of some ideas that have not been fully developed. Similarly we expect the
machinery we have developed to be useful for many other ideas too. Here we mention some
of the avenues we plan to pursue in future.
In our view the most promising and pressing of these directions is an in depth study of
mutations and dualities they encode. We have shown that some of the theories we considered
admit periodic duality cascades. Generalizing the well-known behavior of the conifold, we
presented explicit examples based on the C(Y 1,0(Pm)) family, in which the number of frac-
tional branes remains constant while the number of regular branes depends linearly on the
step of the cascade. It would be interesting to investigate the signiﬁcance of such formal cas-
cades for arbitrary m. Interestingly, gravity duals with a running number of regular branes
exist for systems of branes at CY 4-folds, namely for m = 2 [74]. It would be interesting to
elucidate whether those solutions have a ﬁeld theoretic interpretation in terms of cascades
of trialities.
It is natural to expect that order m + 1 dualities correspond to mutations of exceptional

CHAPTER 11. CONCLUSIONS
208
collections of B-branes. This expectation is supported by the known m = 1 [56, 57, 75] and
m = 2 [40] cases, mirror symmetry [30, 39] and the general discussion in [31]. Making this
connection concrete is another problem we plan to pursue in the future.
In §5.6.3 we described our expectation that the two algorithms printing and products
we described here are parts of larger construction that subsumes the two. That is another
problem we plan to investigate in future. We expect such a construction to an important
tool in the study of generalization of bipartite ﬁeld theories [14, 76] to arbitrary m. Under-
standing such a construction will allows us to systematically construct graded quiver with
superpotential embedded on complicated manifolds starting from simpler ones. As a result it
has the potential of providing us important clues about the generalization of cluster algebras
to arbitrary m.
It would be interesting to develop the general m analogues of other central concepts in the
study of dimers. Zig-zag paths are a prime example. For CY 3-folds, they play a fundamental
role for mirror symmetry [77] and for the corresponding cluster integrable systems [12, 78].
For m = 1, 2, zig-zag paths are given by the diﬀerence between perfect matchings associated
to corners of the toric diagram [29, 79]. It is thus natural to expect that our deﬁnition of
perfect matchings will shed light on this problem.
Perfect matchings on dimers also appear in the context of melting crystal models of CY 3-
folds [80–83]. It would be interesting to study similar melting models for higher dimensional
CY singularities and to investigate their physical interpretations.

B-model computation of quivers and
superpotentials
In this appendix, we provide a brief review of the sheaf computation of quivers and super-
potentials in the B-model. In the main body of the thesis, we use the methods outlined here
to derive the quivers and superpotentials for several inﬁnite families of theories. For more
details, the interested reader can consult [50, 61]. For detailed reviews of B-branes, we refer
to [63, 84].
The D-branes compatible with the B-twist of Type II string theory are called B-branes.
Mathematically, these branes, denoted by E, are objects of the derived category Db(Xm+2)
of the (m+2)-complex-dimensional target space Xm+2. The B-model open string states with
bounda conditions on the two objects E and F are counted by the Ext groups:

encoded in the A∞structure of the derived category. Thus, the A∞structure controls the
terms appearing in the “spacetime” superpotential; see [60, 85] and references therein.
A.1
Ext groups
The B-branes we consider are complex submanifolds of some local Calabi-Yau eXm+2, a
smooth resolution of the CY singularity Xm+2.
Assume S is a complex submanifold of
eXm+2, and E1 and E2 are holomorphic vector bundles over S. If we denote the embedding
of S in eXm+2 by i, then the objects in Db(eXm+2) corresponding to E1 and E2 are i∗E1 and
i∗E2, respectively. The B-model spectrum of open strings between two D-branes on S, with
gauge bundles E1 and E2, is given by:
m+2
M
d=0
Extd
eXm+2(i∗E1, i∗E2) .
(A.2)
The Ext groups above are determined by the following spectral sequence [50]:
Ep,q
2
: Hp(S, E∨
1 ⊗E2 ⊗∧qNS) ⇒Extp+q
eXm+2(i∗E1, i∗E2) ,
(A.3)
where NS is the normal bundle of S in eXm+2. In many cases, the spectral sequence (A.3)
trivializes—that is:
Extd
eXm+2(i∗E1, i∗E2) ∼=
M
p+q=d
Hp(S, E∨
1 ⊗E2 ⊗∧qNS) .
(A.4)
In such cases, we can determine the Ext groups by computing cohomology groups. If S
is a direct product of projective spaces, the cohomology groups can be calculated by the
Borel-Weil-Bott theorem [86, 87], which expresses the Ext groups as representations of the
global symmetry.

APPENDIX A. B-MODEL COMPUTATION OF QUIVERS AND SUPERPOTENTIALS211
A.2
A∞structure
The derived category Db(eXm+2) is an A∞-category. By deﬁnition, an A∞-category C consists
of a collection of objects, Obj(C), a Z-graded vector space of morphisms HomC(E, F) for any
E, F ∈Obj(C) and, for every k ≥1, k-linear maps:
mk : HomC(Ek−1, Ek) ⊗· · · ⊗HomC(E0, E1) →HomC(E0, Ek) ,
(A.5)
of degree 2 −k, satisfying the A∞relations:

(A.6)
for every k > 0. We will follow the method proposed in [61] to compute the composition
maps mk of Db(eXm+2).
Any object in Db(eXm+2) can be represented by a cochain complex E• of locally-free
sheaves over eXm+2. For any pair of complexes, the Ext groups Extd
eXm+2(E•, F•) can be viewed
as the cohomology of the single complex associated with the double complex (K•,•, d, δ) with:
Kp,q(E•, F•) = ˇCp(U, Homq(E•, F•)) ,
(A.7)
where ˇCp(U, ·) denotes the ˘Cech cochains of degree p associated with some acyclic covering
U, and Homq denotes the maps of degree q between complexes, i.e.:
Homq(E•, F•) =
M
i
Hom(Ei, Fi+q) .
(A.8)
In the double complex (K•,•, d, δ), d is the diﬀerential of ˘Cech cochains and δ is deﬁned as

k be diﬀerentials of Ej and Fk respectively, then for any P

where w = (r −1)(i1 −1) + (r −2)(i2 −1) + · · · + (ir−1 −1) and ◦denotes the composition
of maps in ⊕p,qKp,q(•, •). For example, we have:
ιm2 = ι ◦ι + df2 ,
(A.13)
and
ιm3 = f2(id ⊗m2) −f2(m2 ⊗id) + (ι ◦f2) −(f2 ◦ι) + df3 .
(A.14)
To compute the A∞structure, the ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd representatives for a basis of the Ext
groups, which in turn deﬁnes ι. Then, we can employ (A.12) to compute the composition
maps mk.
Speciﬁcally, we can use (A.13) to determine m2 and f2, then use (A.14) to

APPENDIX A. B-MODEL COMPUTATION OF QUIVERS AND SUPERPOTENTIALS213
determine m3 and f3 and so forth.
In the theories we consider, the B-branes of interest are of the form:
i∗E ,
(A.15)
with i the embedding of a complex submanifold S in eXm+2, and E a holomorphic vector
bundle over S. Suppose that E•
l is the Koszul resolution of i∗El:
· · · →E−i
l
→E−i+1
l
→· · · →E0
l →i∗El →0 .
(A.16)
Then, Extd
eXm+2(i∗E1, i∗E2) is the same as Extd
eXm+2(E•
1, E•
2), so that we can use the method
discussed above to compute the composition maps mk.
A.3
Superpotential
Given a graded quiver with nodes corresponding to coherent sheaves i∗Ej, j = 1, · · · , n, where
n is the number of nodes, we can read oﬀthe superpotential from the composition maps mk.
To that end, we ﬁx a basis φ(d)µ
j2,j1 for each Extd
eXm+2(i∗Ej1, i∗Ej2). Following the convention
described in the main text, we will label the corresponding quiver ﬁeld by (Φ(k−1)
j1,j2 )µ. Note
that the Ext generator and the ﬁeld have conjugate indices and diﬀer in degree by 1. The
label µ runs over the generators. For the examples we are considering, it coincides with the
ﬂavor symmetry index. For each j, Extm+2
eXm+2(i∗Ej, i∗Ej) is 1-dimensional. If φ
(n−k)¯µ
j1,j2
is the
generator corresponding to the Serre dual of φ(k)µ
j2,j1, then:
m2(φ

j1,j1 ,
(A.17)

APPENDIX A. B-MODEL COMPUTATION OF QUIVERS AND SUPERPOTENTIALS214
for any j1 and µ.
By choosing a basis, we ﬁx the normalization of the trace map γj :
Extm+2
eXm+2(i∗Ej, i∗Ej) →C deﬁned by:
γj(φn
j,j) = 1 .
(A.18)
For any generator φ(l)
j,i ∈Extl
eXm+2(i∗Ei, i∗Ej), we consider all the paths connecting nodes i
and j in the quiver. If there exist ﬁelds Φ(n1)
s1,i , Φ(n2)
s2,s1, · · · , Φ(nk)
j,sk−1 along some path with k
arrows such that:
γi(m2(φ
(n−l)
i,j
, mk(φ(nk)
j,sk−1, · · · , φ(n1)
s1,i )))
(A.19)
is nonzero, then there is a term proportional to:
Φ(n1−1)
i,s1
· · · Φ(nk−1)
sk−1,j Φ
(n−m−1)
j,i
,
(A.20)
with the coeﬃcient equal to (A.19) in the superpotential.
Similarly, if there exist ﬁelds
Φ(n1)
s1,j , Φ(n2)
s2,s1, · · · , Φ(nk)
i,sk−1 along some path in the opposite direction such that:
γj(m2(φ(l)
j,i, mk(φ(nk)
i,sk−1, · · · , φ(n1)
s1,j )))
(A.21)
is nonzero, then there is a term proportional to
Φ(n1−1)
j,s1,
· · · Φ(nk−1)
sk−1,i Φ(l−1)
i,j
,
(A.22)
with the coeﬃcient equal to (A.21) in the superpotential. Every term in the superpoten-
tial can be computed this way, thus the A∞structure of the derived category completely
determines the superpotential.
Note that, since γ is only non-zero on Extm+2 generators, and since mk has degree 2 −k,

APPENDIX A. B-MODEL COMPUTATION OF QUIVERS AND SUPERPOTENTIALS215
the “superpotential coupling” (A.21) is non-zero only if:
l +
k
X
j=1
nj = m + k .
(A.23)
This is simply the ghost-number selection rule for disk correlators in the B-model. It directly
follows that the only terms that can appear in the superpotential have quiver degree:
deg
 Φ(n1−1)
j,s1,
· · · Φ(nk−1)
sk−1,i Φ(l−1)

= l −1 +

j=1
(nj −1) = m −1 .
(A.24)
Hence, the degree constraint for the superpotential of an m-graded quiver is automatically
satisﬁed.
A.4
Sheaves on Pn: a primer
In order to derive the quivers and superpotentials for the geometries considered in this
paper using the technology we have just discussed, it is useful to review some notions about
sheaves on Pn. In the rest of this section, we present several elementary results about ˇCech
cohomology with sections taking values in such sheaves.
Let us start with the presentation of Pn in the homogeneous coordinates. Starting from
Cn+1, we obtain Pn by identifying:
(z0, · · · , zn) ∼λ(z0, · · · , zn) .
(A.25)
From this presentation, we can pass on to standard charts on Pn. There are n + 1 of these
charts, denoted by Uµ. Uµ covers the complex lines for which zµ ̸= 0. We will denote the
ith local coordinate on Uµ by wµ,i, with 1 ≤i ≤n. The explicit map between the two

APPENDIX A. B-MODEL COMPUTATION OF QUIVERS AND SUPERPOTENTIALS216
presentations is:
wµ,i =





z0
zµ
i = µ ,
zi
zµ
i ̸= µ .
A.4.1
Sheaves O(p)
The tautological line bundle, denoted by O(−1), is the sheaf on Pn which assigns to each
point in it the line it represents in Cn+1. We denote the basis of this sheaf on the chart Uµ by
eµ. The transition functions between diﬀerent charts are then represented by the equation:
ei = w−1
0,i e0 .
(A.26)
The sheaf O(−p), for p > 0, is the sheaf which locally has as its basis the pth tensor
power ep
µ of eµ. The sheaf O(p), for p > 0, is deﬁned to be the dual sheaf of O(−p). In
particular let e∗
µ be the basis of O(1) in the chart µ then the transition functions for it are
determined by:
e∗
i = w0,ie∗
0 .
(A.27)
(e∗
µ)p form a basis of O(p) in Uµ. Finally, O(0), which is often denoted as O, is the trivial
sheaf.
Tangent and cotangent bundles
One-forms dw0,i form a basis of the cotangent bundle in the µth chart. The transition matrix
can be found using (A.26). We will not reproduce all of them here, but will mention an

APPENDIX A. B-MODEL COMPUTATION OF QUIVERS AND SUPERPOTENTIALS217
identity that will be useful for our calculations, namely:
w−i
0,idw0,i = −w−1
i,i dwi,i .
(A.28)
Ωp is the pth antisymmetric tensor power of Ω. The transition functions again follow
straightforwardly, albeit tediously, from (A.26). The situation is simplest for the highest
non-trivial power, i.e. Ωn, also called the determinant bundle. Its basis is ∧idwµ,i and the
transition function is the determinant of the transition matrix for Ω:
∧jdw0,j = w−n−1
i,i
∧j dwi,j .
(A.29)
The tangent bundle Ω∗is the dual of the cotangent bundle. In the local coordinates of the
chart Uµ, its basis is given by the vector ﬁelds
∂
∂wµ,i. Locally, the action of vector ﬁelds on
the diﬀerential form is given by contraction or interior derivation.
A.4.2
ˇCech cohomology
Next, we turn to the computation of some sheaf-valued ˇCech cohomology groups on Pn. We
will also organize them into representations of SU(n+1), with its action on Pn induced from
Cn+1. The most basic of these are ˇC0, which correspond to the global section of the said
sheaves.
O(−p) has no global sections for p > 0. The same is true for Ωp. However their dual
bundles do have global sections. For O(p) with p ≥0, a local section is determined by
a homogeneous polynomial of degree p in the homogeneous coordinates zµ. These obvi-
ously transform in the symmetric (p, 0)-index tensor representation of SU(n + 1), which has
dimension
 n+1+p
p

.
The tangent bundle Ω∗has (n+1)2 −1 global sections. In the homogeneous coordinates,

APPENDIX A. B-MODEL COMPUTATION OF QUIVERS AND SUPERPOTENTIALS218
these are given by:
zµ
∂
∂zν
,
(A.30)
with the linear relation P
µ zµ
∂
∂zµ = 0.
They transform in the adjoint representation of
SU(n + 1).
More relevant for us will be the sheaf Ω∗(−1). 1 It has (n + 1) of global sections trans-
forming in the (0, 1)-index representation of SU(n + 1). Locally in U0, they can be written
as:
ϕ0 = −
X
i
w0,i
∂
∂w0,i
⊗e0 ,
ϕi =
∂
∂w0,i
⊗e0 .
(A.31)
The maps between two sheaves E and F form a sheaf denoted by Hom(E, F). The sections
(A.31) can also be regarded as the global sections of Hom(Ω, O(−1)). More generally, they
can be regarded as global sections of Hom(Ωi+1(j + 1), Ωi(j)).
We can also easily compute the global sections of Hom(Ωi+k(j+k), Ωi(j)). These are given
by antisymmetric compositions of λi deﬁned above and they transform in the antisymmetric
k-index 2 representation of SU(n + 1). Concretely, a basis of them is given by:
ϕµ1···µk = 1
k!ϕ[µ1 ◦ϕµ2 ◦· · · ◦ϕµk] .
(A.32)
The square brackets represent the antisymmetrization of the indices they enclose.
1For any sheaf F we deﬁne F(p) to be F tensored with O(p).
2More formally (0, k), but throughout the paper all the representations we mention are of this form and
we will just write k to simplify the notation.

APPENDIX A. B-MODEL COMPUTATION OF QUIVERS AND SUPERPOTENTIALS219
A.4.3
Serre duality
Serre duality is one of the most important properties of these sheaf-valued cohomology
groups. In the present case, it is the statement that there is an isomorphism between ˇCi(E)
and ˇCn−i(E∗(−n −1))∗.
Let us see how this plays out in the case of Hom(Ωn(n+j), O(j)), which we computed in
the last section. Its dual sheaf is Hom(O(j), Ωn(n + j)) ∼= Ω(n). So, to exhibit Serre duality
we need to ﬁnd ˇCn(Ωn(−1)).
An element of Ωn(−1) is a top form with coeﬃcients in O(−1). It being in the nth ˇCech
cohomology means that it is holomorphic in ∩µUµ, i.e. intersection of all n + 1 charts, but
not holomorphic in any intersection of n charts. Let us consider the ansatz that a member
¯ϕ of this cohomology group is given in the coordinates of U0 by:
¯ϕ = ∧iwpi
0,idw0,i ⊗e0 .
(A.33)
Using (A.26) and (A.29), we see that, in the local coordinates of patch Ui, we can write ¯ϕ
as:
¯ϕ = (−1)iw
−n−2−P
j pj
i,i
dwi,i ∧m
j̸=i w
pj
i,jdwi,j ⊗ei .
(A.34)
The holomorphy constraint described above means that:
pi < 0
and
−
X
i
pi < n + 2 .
(A.35)

APPENDIX A. B-MODEL DETAILS
220
Hence, there are n + 1 choices of ¯ϕ:
¯ϕ0 = ∧jw−1
0,jdw0,j ⊗e0 ,
¯ϕi = w−1
0,i ∧j w−1
0,jdw0,j ⊗e0 .
(A.36)
The dimension n + 1 is indeed the one we would have expected from Serre duality. Note
that ¯ϕ transforms in the 1-index representation of SU(n + 1) which is conjugate to the
representation in which elements of Hom(Ωn(n + j), O(j)), i.e. ϕi1···in, transform.
