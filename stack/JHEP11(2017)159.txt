Abstract: We ﬁnd a new example of an asymptotically AdS5 × S5 geometry which has
an entanglement shadow: that is, a region of spacetime which no Ryu-Takayanagi minimal
surface enters. Our example is a particular case of the supersymmetric LLM geometries.
Our results illustrate how minimal surfaces, which holographically geometrize entanglement
entropy, can fail to probe the whole of spacetime, posing a challenge for attempts to directly
reconstruct holographic geometries from the entanglement entropies of the dual ﬁeld theory.
We also comment on the relation to previous investigations of minimal surfaces localised
in the S5 factor of AdS5 × S5.

Introduction
The Ryu-Takayanagi proposal [1] and its generalizations provide a map between quantum
entanglement of spatial regions of a strongly coupled large-N ﬁeld theory and the spacetime
geometry of its gravitational dual, by relating entanglement entropies to areas of minimal or
extremal [2] surfaces. This has led to explicit progress in bulk reconstruction, particularly
for linearized perturbations of anti-de Sitter space [3–5]. There are also attempts to directly
represent the areas of arbitrary surfaces in asymptotically AdS spacetimes in terms of
new information theoretic observables such as “diﬀerential entropy” [6–8]. All of these
eﬀorts explicitly use the geometry and deformations of extremal surfaces of holographic
geometries.
This program is complicated (or enriched, as the reader prefers) by the existence
of entanglement shadows: regions of the bulk spacetime which are not reached by any
minimal or extremal surfaces used to compute entanglement between spatial regions of the
boundary (see, e.g., [9, 10]). Holographic geometries with entanglement shadows require
additional quantities beyond spatial entanglement in the dual ﬁeld theory for the purpose
of bulk geometry reconstruction.1
Consider, for example, the conical defect spacetimes
describing excitations of AdS3.
In this case, non-minimal extremal surfaces enter the

model [11], which is a quantum-mechanical model with an 11d holographic dual [12, 13].

entanglement shadow region, and there is a candidate generalization of spatial entanglement
called entwinement which yields quantities dual to the area of these surfaces [9, 14, 15].
In this work, we will argue that a simple but topologically non-trivial asymptotically
AdS5 × S5 geometry has an entanglement shadow.
Our example is one of the “LLM
geometries” [16], which are holographically dual to 1/2-BPS excitations of N = 4 super-
Yang Mills theory. These geometries are smooth but topologically complex, and the map to
the dual ﬁeld theory state is known precisely. From the perspective of reconstructing bulk
geometry from quantities in the dual ﬁeld theory, one of the most interesting aspects of
the LLM geometries is that they are inherently 10-dimensional — there is no factorization
into an asymptotically AdS5 part and a compact part. If there were such a factorization,
we could “compactify” the reconstruction problem to one of just recovering the geometry
and ﬁelds in the asymptotically AdS factor, but that is not possible here. In fact, it is
known that reconstructing the interior geometry and topology of LLM spacetimes from
the dual ﬁeld theory using just local operator measurements would require access to trans-
Planckian physics [17, 18]. In particular, around conﬁgurations with non-trivial topology
there is entanglement between the eﬀective dynamical degrees of freedom and UV modes
that are beyond the Planck scale [19–21].
We will consider an LLM geometry which is approximately AdS5 × S5 in both the
asymptotic region and a central region in the spacetime. In our geometry, the S3 radial
sections of the asymptotic AdS5 essentially exchange roles with an S3 factor inside the S5
to form the central AdS5 region. In this geometry, we study minimal surfaces anchored
at the equator of the S3 on the spacetime boundary; these are expected to be the deepest
minimal surface probes of the geometry, and compute the entanglement entropy of half
the ﬁeld theory with the other half. Because of the exchange of the roles of the S3 factors
which we described above, a surface that partitions the boundary of AdS in the asymptotic
region will partition the S5 in the central region. Making some systematic approximations,
we ﬁnd that in this central region, the minimal surface for a boundary condition which
divides the S5 penetrates into the bulk only for a proper radial distance of order one in the
central AdS factor. At this distance, this surface closes oﬀby reaching the pole on the S5.
From the point of view of the full LLM geometry, this implies that essentially the whole
of the central IR region is not accessed by boundary-anchored minimal surfaces. This is
our shadow region. We then argue that there is an extremal non-minimal surface, also
anchored at the equator of the spacetime boundary, which does enter the shadow region.
This is similar situation as for the conical defects in AdS3 which have an entanglement
shadow which is penetrated by non-minimal, but extremal, surfaces [9].
Unlike in AdS3 [14, 15] we do not yet have a candidate information theoretic quantity
such as entwinement that computes the area of a non-minimal extremal surface from the
perspective of the dual ﬁeld theory.
The idea in [14, 15] was that non-minimal extremal surfaces (“long” geodesics in that
case) were related to entanglement in a partition of degrees of freedom of the dual ﬁeld
theory that was not spatially organized. It would be worth understanding whether there
is such an interpretation for non-minimal extremal surfaces in the AdS5 case also. In-
teresting earlier holographic studies of Yang-Mills theory in the Coulomb branch [22–24]

had proposed that a minimal surface which divides the S5 part of the boundary of an
asymptotically AdS5 × S5 spacetime can be identiﬁed with the entanglement entropy as-
sociated to a non-spatial division of the ﬁeld theory degrees of freedom. In the context
of our geometries, the surfaces described by [22–24] can be regarded as extremal surfaces
in the central AdS5 region, which can be extended into the asymptotic AdS5 region to
describe entanglement in a conventional spatial partition of the UV theory. Our analysis
shows that the particular extremal surfaces studied in [22–24] are not, in fact, the minimal
ones that are asymptotic to the equator of the boundary S5. It would be very interesting
to understand what information theoretic quantity is being computed by such extremal
surfaces, and also by the true minimal surfaces with these boundary conditions.
Our paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we brieﬂy review the LLM geometries
ﬁrst constructed in [16], and introduce the examples we consider. In section 3 we consider
extremal surfaces in the central region of our geometries, and explain the relation to the
earlier work of [22–24]. In section 4, we argue that the boundary-anchored minimal surfaces
in our spacetime close oﬀon the central S5 without penetrating deep into the central
region. Hence these LLM geometries have entanglement shadows. In section 5, we discuss
the extension to other LLM geometries and the interpretation of our results.

LLM geometries
The 1/2 BPS solutions found by Lin, Lunin and Maldacena (LLM) [16] provide a rich class
of asymptotically AdS5 × S5 spacetimes where the geometry can be analyzed analytically,
and for which precise ﬁeld theory duals are known. We will focus on a simple example
in this class, and ﬁnd the bulk extremal surface whose area computes the entanglement
between halves of the spatial S3, across an equator, in the dual ﬁeld theory.
The LLM geometries correspond to 1/2 BPS states in N = 4 SYM on S3 × R, where
the energy of the state (∆) is equal to the charge (J) under a U(1) subgroup of the SO(6)
R-symmetry, ∆= J.
The dual geometries should thus be asymptotically AdS5 × S5
solutions preserving half the supersymmetry, the SO(4) rotational symmetry on the spatial
S3, an SO(4) subgroup of the R-symmetry, and a diagonal R group which combines time
translation with the U(1) ∈SO(6) to leave the state invariant. LLM found that these
restrictions ﬁx the form of the geometry up to a single function of three coordinates,
z(y, x1, x2) [16]. The metric is

Figure 1. LLM conﬁgurations in the (x1, x2) plane. The conﬁgurations describe boundary con-
ditions for the equations of motion on a two dimensional surface in the bulk spacetime, and also
correspond to conﬁgurations in a fermionic phase space that completely summarizes the boundary
1/2 BPS state. The black disc boundary condition (a) leads to a pure AdS5 × S5 geometry. We
will show that no entangling surface can probe deeply into the IR region of the geometry given by
the annulus boundary condition (b).
The geometry is supported by a self-dual ﬁve-form; the explicit form of the ﬁeld strength is
not needed here. Note that in these coordinates the length element ds2 has units of length,
as do y, x1, x2, while t is a dimensionless quantity.
The range of the coordinates is y ∈(0, ∞), xi ∈(−∞, ∞), so this is an upper half
space. The metric and ﬁve-form give a solution of the supergravity equations of motion if
the function z obeys

= 0.
(2.4)
The solutions will be smooth if z satisﬁes the boundary condition z →±1/2 as y →0. The
general solution of (2.4) with such boundary conditions was given in [16]. Hence solutions
are speciﬁed by giving a colouring of the x1, x2 plane, specifying regions where z →1/2,
which we will draw in white, and regions where z →−1/2, which we will draw in black.
The regions where z →−1/2 correspond to the ﬁrst S3, with metric dΩ2
3, shrinking to zero
as y →0, while z →1/2 corresponds to the second ˜S3, with metric d˜Ω2
3, shrinking to zero.
Note that the solution is a ten-dimensional geometry, and except in special cases, it
is not possible to straightforwardly perform a Kaluza-Klein reduction to obtain a ﬁve-
dimensional description; we really need to think about these geometries using a ten-
dimensional perspective.

AdS5 × S5
The simplest example is the disc, where z = −1/2 for r < R, and z = 1/2 for r > R, where
r2 = x2

This corresponds to the vacuum AdS5 × S5 solution. If we make the change of coordinates
y = R sinh ˜χ sin ˜θ,
r = R cosh ˜χ cos ˜θ,
˜φ = φ −t,
(2.6)
where φ is the angular coordinate in the x1, x2 plane, the metric becomes:
ds2 = R(−cosh2 ˜χdt2 + d˜χ2 + sinh2 ˜χdΩ2
3 + d˜θ2 + cos2 ˜θd˜φ2 + sin2 ˜θd˜Ω2
3).
(2.7)
The ﬁrst three terms describe the metric on AdS5 with AdS radius R; the last three terms
describe the metric on S5 with constant radius R.
In these coordinates, for r < R, y = 0 corresponds to ˜χ = 0, while for r > R, y = 0
corresponds to ˜θ = 0. Thus, the black disc r < R corresponds to the origin in the AdS
factor, with position on the disc mapping to position on the S5. The ﬁbration of ˜S3 over
a hemisphere surrounding this disc is topologically an S5, homologous to the S5 factor in
the geometry (2.7).
A partial visualization is shown in ﬁgure 2. We can invert the coordinate transforma-
tion to write the AdS radial coordinate in general as
sinh2 ˜χ =

.
(2.8)
At y2 + r2 ≫R2, sinh2 ˜χ ≈(y2 + r2)/R2, so the round hemispheres shown for large r2 + y2
are approximately surfaces of constant radius in the AdS5 factor, but at y2 + r2 ≪R2,
sinh2 ˜χ ≈y2/R2, so the planes of constant y are approximately constant AdS radius,
approaching ˜χ = 0 in the black disc.
2.2
Annulus
Perhaps the simplest nontrivial LLM geometry, and the one we will consider, is described
by an annulus in the x1 −x2 plane, with a white disc inside the black one (ﬁgure 1b).
That is, we take the boundary conditions for the function z to be z(y = 0, r > R) = 1
2,
z(y = 0, R > r > ϵ) = −1
2, and z(y = 0, r < ϵ) = 1

(2.10)
The physical picture of this conﬁguration is that it represents the back-reacted version
of maximal giant gravitons [25]. We consider a set of D3-branes wrapping the ˜S3 inside
S5 at ˜θ = π/2 where this ˜S3 has maximal volume, with angular momentum along ˜φ
corresponding to the R-charge. These D-branes dissolve into the backreacted geometry.
Note that because of the angular momentum, the annulus geometry is stationary but not
static.

2.3
Approximating the annulus geometry
Extremal surfaces in the annulus geometry are in general complicated, and ﬁnding them
involves solving a nonlinear PDE in two variables. To make the problem more tractable,
we will consider the case where ϵ ≪R, so that the white hole in the center of ﬁgure 1b
is small compared to the area of the outer disk. We will still consider the case that both
radii are large compared to the string or Planck scales. The result is a separation of scales
that leads to a straightforward picture of the geometry.
To begin with, we can consider the coordinates at “large” radius, for which r2 + y2 ≫
ϵR. In this case, the white disk in the center will appear small and we expect the geometry
to be a small perturbation of an AdS5 × S5 geometry with radius of curvature R. More
precisely, the last term in (2.10) can be approximated by a series expansion in ϵ2/(r2 +y2),
which at leading order gives
z ≈1

r2 + y2 −R2
p
(r2 + y2 + R2)2 −4r2R2 +
ϵ2y2
(r2 + y2)2 .
(2.11)
The corresponding geometry is the AdS5 × S5 metric (2.7) with a subleading correction
which decays at large distances. We call this the “UV AdS region”.
On the other hand, if we consider small distances r2 + y2 ≪ϵR, the geometry is well
approximated by a black plane with a white disk in the center. Now the LLM geometries
are symmetric under z = 1
2 →−1
2 while exchanging S3 and ˜S3; thus, the region is well
approximated by AdS5 ×S5 with radius of curvature ϵ, which we dub the “IR AdS region”.
More precisely, the second term in (2.10) can be expanded in a series in 1/R2, which gives
z ≈−1

r2 + y2 −ϵ2
p
(r2 + y2 + ϵ2)2 −4r2ϵ2 + y2
R2 .
(2.12)
The ﬁnal term in (2.12) gives a correction to IR AdS which decays in the interior, and
grows as we move to large distances. The fact that the sign of the leading term in z is
reversed as compared to (2.11) means that ˜S3 is now the sphere factor in the IR AdS space,
while S3 is the sphere factor in the S5. If we further adopt the AdS coordinates
y = ϵ sinh χ sin Θ,
r = ϵ cosh χ cos Θ,
˜φ = φ + t,
(2.13)

ds2 = ϵ(−cosh2 χdt2 + dχ2 + sinh2 χd˜Ω2
3 + cos2 Θd˜φ2 + dΘ2 + sin2 ΘdΩ2
3) ,
(2.14)
making the approximate AdS5 × S5 geometry explicit.
The IR AdS geometry can be thought of as the back-reacted description of the D3-
branes in the giant graviton picture mentioned in section 2.2 above. The D3-branes wrap
the ˜S3, so this becomes the spatial directions in the AdS factor in this IR geometry.
One might hope that these two descriptions have an overlapping regime of validity,
where ϵ2 ≪r2 + y2 ≪R2. However, in this intermediate regime,
z ≈−1
2 + y2
R2 +
ϵ2y2
(y2 + r2)2 .
(2.15)
The second and third terms are small, but as features of the geometry depend on z + 1
2,
we cannot neglect either of them.
We therefore need to analyze the behavior in this
region independently. As an indication, consider the volume of the spheres S3, ˜S3. The S3
volume is:
yeG ≈y2
R
s

ϵ2R2
(y2 + r2)2 ,
(2.16)
and the ˜S3 volume is
ye−G ≈R

1 +
ϵ2R2
(y2 + r2)2
−1/2
.
(2.17)
To arrive at these we solved for eG using (2.2) and the approximation (2.15) for z, throwing
out terms that are higher order in ϵ/R. If y2 + r2 ∼ϵR, the terms inside the square roots
in each equation are all of order O(1), and the square roots cannot be approximated as
constants. Thus, this region is not well covered by either the UV or the IR AdS approxi-
mation.
Instead, a natural coordinate system in this region is:
y =
√
ϵReζ sin Θ,
r =
√
ϵReζ cos Θ,
(2.18)
so that y2 + r2 ∼ϵR corresponds to ζ near zero. This is essentially a rescaled version of
the IR coordinates (2.13), with eχ =

(2.23)
This metric is static and stationary up to corrections that are down by powers of p ϵ
R. The
approximations leading to this form of the metric hold if ϵ2 ≪y2+r2 ≪R2, so that we can
up to a point take ζ ≪0. In this limit, we regain the large χ part of the IR metric (2.14)
plus small corrections. Note the particular simpliﬁcation in this intermediate region: the
coordinates of the IR S5 are multiplied by the same radial factor, so that the geometry
still has the SO(6) × SO(4) symmetry of the IR region.
Thus, we have three approximate descriptions: the IR AdS description, (2.14), valid for
r2 +y2 ≪ϵR, the intermediate description (2.23), valid for ϵ2 ≪r2 +y2 ≪R2, and the UV
AdS description (2.7), valid for r2 + y2 ≫ϵR. Between the UV and IR AdS descriptions
there is an exchange of spheres: the S3 in the asymptotic AdS factor exchanges roles in
the IR geometry with an S3 that is the S5 factor of the asymptotic geometry. We will use
these three overlapping descriptions to analyze the minimal surfaces.

Extremal surfaces in empty AdS5 × S5
As we have discussed, the annulus geometry for ϵ ≪R interpolates between two AdS5 ×S5
regions, a “UV” region with radius of curvature R, and an “IR” region, with radius of
curvature ϵ. In this background, we are interested in ﬁnding extremal surfaces which are
anchored at the equator of the UV boundary, bisecting the S3 of the asymptotically AdS
factor of the geometry. Because of the symmetry of the problem, and taking θ to be polar
angle on this S3 (Ω3 in the metric (2.7)), there is an extremal surface at ﬁxed t = t0, θ = π
2
which extends from the UV region into the IR region. In the UV region this surface wraps
the S5 factor and bisects the S3 of the asymptotic AdS5. As we discussed above, in the IR
region, the S3 of the asymptotic AdS5 exchanges roles with an S3 inside the S5. Thus, in
the IR region (2.14) a ﬁxed θ = π
2 surface wraps the ˜S3 of the AdS factor, while bisecting
the S5 factor.
As we will show, this is not the actual minimal surface for the LLM geometry. To
understand why, it will be helpful to ﬁrst consider the co-dimension two spacelike minimal
surfaces of empty AdS5 × S5 with boundary conditions that either bisect the AdS5 or the
S5. Extremal surfaces bisecting the S5 of AdS5 × S5 were previously studied in [22–24]
the authors of which were interested in studying non-spatially organized entanglement in
the Coulomb branch of gauge theories. We are interested in such surfaces because in our
LLM setting the obvious candidate minimal surface bisects the S5 of the AdS5 × S5 in the
interior of the geometry (the “IR”). We will show that surfaces that occupy a ﬁxed angular
– 8 –

JHEP11(2017)159
position on the S5 cannot in fact be a minimal surface; in fact, if we cut oﬀthe AdS5 factor
by any amount, a minimal surface that partitions the S5 at the cutoﬀslips oﬀthe sphere
over radial distances of order the cutoﬀ. In our LLM case, this will imply that the minimal
surfaces of interest to us, which bisect the asymptotic AdS5 boundary, will slip oﬀthe S5
in the deep interior part of the geometry and thus terminate smoothly before penetrating
this region.
3.1
Minimal surfaces bisecting AdS5
In pure AdS5 × S5 the minimal surface that bisects the boundary of the AdS5 factor
penetrates all the way to origin of the spacetime; hence there is no entanglement shadow.
Because the geometry is factorized we can see this from just the AdS5 part of the full
geometry in (2.7). Let us choose coordinates for the S3 part of AdS5 in (2.7) so that the
metric on this sphere is
dΩ2
3 = dθ2 + sin2 θdΩ2
2 .
(3.1)
We want to ﬁnd minimal spacelike co-dimension 2 surfaces in AdS5 which bound the region
θ ≤θ0 at the boundary (˜χ →∞in (2.7)); following Ryu and Takayanagi such a surface
should compute the entanglement entropy of the region θ ≤θ0 in the ﬁeld theory dual
to the space. We can take the minimal surface to lie t = 0, and specify it by a function
θ(˜χ) with the boundary condition θ →θ0 as ˜χ →∞. In the LLM coordinates (see the
coordinate transformation (2.6)), the minimal surface is thus speciﬁed by θ(r, y) with the
boundary condition θ →θ0 as r2 + y2 →∞. Note that the function θ is typically not
deﬁned for all r, y; the RT surface will end where θ = 0, that is where it reaches the north
pole on the S3. As we increase θ0, the minimal surface will probe deeper and deeper into
the bulk, and the minimal surface for θ0 = π/2, where we keep half of the boundary, should
be simply θ = π/2 everywhere, slicing the AdS factor in half.
It is obvious by symmetry that θ = π/2 is an extremal surface for the boundary
conditions θ0 = π/2, but it is not immediately obvious in these coordinates that it has
minimal area. This will be an important distinction later, so we note here that we can
make the minimality of the θ = π/2 surface manifest via the coordinate transformation
sinh ρ = sinh ˜χ cos θ,
tanh γ = tanh ˜χ sin θ.
(3.2)
In these coordinates the AdS5 part of the metric in (2.7) is
ds2 = −cosh2 ρ cosh2 γdt2 + dρ2 + cosh2 ρ(dγ2 + sinh2 γdΩ2
2).
(3.3)
The extremal surface at t = 0, θ = π/2 becomes the hyperbolic disc at ρ = 0 in these
coordinates. To see that this surface is in fact minimal we start at the boundary of this
disc (γ →∞) and observe that if θ were to change from π/2 as γ decreases, the cosh2 ρ
factor (which is 1 when θ = π/2) would increase, and with it the area of the surface.
In this AdS example, we can work with a ﬁve-dimensional description, but in general
LLM geometries we need to work in a ten-dimensional geometry. The extension of the
Ryu-Takayanagi prescription to this ten-dimensional setting is to consider a codimension
two spacelike surface in the full ten-dimensional geometry, the area of which is calculated
– 9 –

JHEP11(2017)159
in units of the ten-dimensional Newton’s constant [26] (see [27] for a fuller discussion).
In the present case, the minimal surface in the ten-dimensional description is simply the
eight dimensional surface at t = 0, θ = π/2, wrapping the S2 in the S3, the S5, and the
extending along the radial ˜χ direction in the AdS factor. In the LLM coordinates (2.1),
this surface wraps the equatorial S2 ⊂S3 and the entire ˜S3; and it ﬁlls the y, x1, x2 space.
3.2
Extremal surfaces bisecting S5
Ref. [22] considered surfaces in AdS5 × S5 which slice the S5 in half, while wrapping the
AdS5 factor. The authors proposed that such surfaces could be interpreted as geometrizing
entanglement between diﬀerent CFT components on the S5, corresponding to some non-
spatial decomposition of the CFT Hilbert space. This was further investigated in [23, 24],
where it was proposed that it could correspond to decomposing the CFT Hilbert space in
terms of R symmetry representations. The analysis in [22, 24] was mainly based on going
onto the Coulomb branch of the CFT on R4, where one could deﬁne a division of the CFT
Hilbert space at low energies into two factors associated with the unbroken gauge group at
low energies. But the relationship of entanglement between these factors and geometrical
surfaces in the bulk remains conjectural.
On the other hand, the extremal surfaces that appear in [22–24] are directly relevant
to the holographic representation of spatial entanglement in the annular LLM geometry
that we are studying here. If we start in the UV region with a spatial decomposition of
the ﬁeld theory along an equator θ0 = π/2, the symmetries of the theory including t →−t
imply that the surface t = constant, θ = π/2 is an extremal surface. In the IR region,
there is an eﬀective description in terms of a new CFT dual to the IR AdS geometry. In
this IR geometry, as discussed above, the extension of a surface that is asymptotically at
θ0 = π/2 bisects an equator on the S5. Thus, a surface that bisects the S5 of the IR AdS
space becomes related to a surface that bisects the AdS5 of the UV region and hence to a
spatial decomposition of the UV theory.
Thus, if we understand the details of how the IR CFT embeds in the UV CFT, we
might be able to interpret surfaces of the kind studied in [22, 24]. We will not pursue such
a CFT understanding here. Instead, we will show that in an AdS5 × S5 geometry, the
minimal ﬁxed-t codimension two surface which bisects the equator of S5 at the boundary
of AdS5 does not extend into the interior of the AdS5 factor. Rather, for any radial cutoﬀ,
the surface extends inwards only by an amount of order that cutoﬀ.
Consider AdS5 ×S5 spacetime with metric (2.14) (i.e. in the coordinates on AdS5 ×S5
that arise in the IR part of the annular LLM geometry).
We can show that in these
coordinates θ = π/2 corresponds to an equator on the S5, by introducing new coordinates
(in analogy to the change to hyperbolic slicing in AdS in (3.2)). To this end, set
cos θ′ = sin Θ cos θ,
sin θ′ cos β = cos Θ,
(3.4)
so that the metric becomes
ds2 = ϵ(−cosh2 χdt2+dχ2+sinh2 χd˜Ω2
3+dθ′2+sin2 θ′(dβ2+cos2 βd˜φ2+sin2 βdΩ2
2)). (3.5)
– 10 –

JHEP11(2017)159
The surface at θ = π/2 is at θ′ = π/2, and is nicely exhibited as an equatorial S4 in the
S5 in these coordinates (i.e., the metric dβ2 · · · within the ﬁnal parenthesis in (3.5)).
In this geometry, this surface is not minimal.
This is easily seen by considering a
surface where θ′ is some function of χ: the induced metric on the surface is
ds2 = ϵ((1 + (∂χθ′)2)dχ2 + sinh2 χd˜Ω2
3 + sin2 θ′(χ)dΩ2
4),
(3.6)
so the area functional is
A = ϵ4VS4VS3
Z
dχ sinh3 χ
q
1 + (∂χθ′)2 sin4 θ′.
(3.7)
We can choose a non-trivial function θ′(χ) satisfying the boundary condition θ′ →π/2 as
χ →∞which will lower the area; we just need
p
1 + (∂χθ′)2 sin4 θ′ < 1. For θ′ = π/2 −α
for small α, this is 1
2(∂χα)2 −2α2 < 0. An example of a function of compact support which
makes ∆A < 0 is α = α0(e−χ+3 −1) for χ < 3, α = 0 for χ > 3. Thus we know there are
other surfaces with smaller area, before even constructing the minimal surface.
To ﬁnd the form of the true minimal surface, we turn to the Euler-Lagrange equation
for the action (3.7):
∂2
χθ′ −(1 + (∂χθ′)2)(−3 coth χ∂χθ′ + 4 cot θ′) = 0 ,
(3.8)
or in terms of χ(θ′),
∂2
θ′χ + (1 + (∂θ′χ)2)(−3 coth χ + 4 cot θ′∂θ′χ) = 0 .
(3.9)
There are two possibilities for a smooth surface; either the surface extends to χ = 0, with
some limiting value θ′(0) = θmin, and ∂χθ′ = 0, or it ends by pinching oﬀat the north pole
θ′ = 0 at some χ = χmin, with ∂χθ′ →∞at χmin. It is convenient to analyse the second
possibility in terms of χ(θ′) rather than θ′(χ), so that the smoothness condition becomes
∂′
θχ(0) = 0. Note that if ∂χθ′ = 0, ∂2
χθ′ ≥0, so a smooth function satisfying this equation
can have a maximum but no minima. In particular, if θ′ = 0 at some χmin it must be
monotonic.
We expect the true minimal surface to pinch oﬀby reaching θ′ = 0. The reason θ = π/2
with bisects the S5 is not minimal in this geometry (unlike the surface which bisects the
AdS5 factor) is that the size of the S3 ⊂S5 is independent of the radial χ direction. Thus,
instead of extending down to the origin in the AdS factor, the surface can reduce its area
by pinching oﬀon the sphere. Since there is no scale to determine the value χmin at which
the pinch-oﬀoccurs, it will be determined by the radius at which we cut oﬀthe AdS factor.
That is, we expect that over the range between a radial AdS cutoﬀat some χ = χmax and
χ = χmax −∆χ the minimal surface should move from θ ≈π/2 to end at θ = 0, where ∆χ
is independent of χmax.
Since χ is expected to remain large over the full range of θ′, we can approximate (3.9) by
∂2
θ′χ + (1 + (∂θ′χ)2)(−3 + 4 cot θ′∂θ′χ) = 0.
(3.10)
This is independent of χ, which reﬂects an invariance of the area functional (3.7) in
this approximation under χ →χ + a. This is thus a ﬁrst order equation for ∂θ′χ(θ′), which
– 11 –

JHEP11(2017)159
we should solve with the boundary condition ∂θ′χ(0) = 0. We can make this equation look
nicer by writing ∂θ′χ(θ′) = tan α(θ′); then
∂θ′α = 3 −4 tan α
tan θ′ .
(3.11)
At θ′ ≈π/2, we can linearize around π/2 to obtain

so the solution approaches π/2 exponentially; if we want θ′ = π/2−δ at the cutoﬀχ = χmax,
it will extend to a range of order ∆χ ∼−2
3 ln δ.
In the limit χmax →∞with ﬁxed δ, this surface has inﬁnitely less area than the one
at θ′ = π/2.

Shadow region in annulus LLM geometry
We can now address our main question. Consider the entanglement across the equator of
the S3 for super-Yang-Mills on S3 × R, in the state dual to the annulus LLM geometry
with ϵ ≪R where ϵ is much bigger than the Planck and string lengths.
What is the
conﬁguration of the extremal surface computing this entanglement, and how far into the
interior does the surface extend?
Since this geometry is not static (though it is stationary), in principle we need to
consider extremal surfaces following the prescription [2]. However, in the UV and inter-
mediate regimes, the metric is static up to corrections of multiplicative order
p
ϵ/R. If
we approximate the metric as static, we will ﬁnd that the resulting minimal surface at
t = 0, computed following [1], does not go beyond the intermediate regime into the interior
regime. Thus we can self-consistently use the prescription in [1]. Note also that the surface
at ﬁxed t also respects the t →−t, φ →−φ symmetry of the metric, so it is at least an
extremal surface.
We thus consider a minimal surface dividing the S3 in (2.1) (which is the S3 of the
asymptotic AdS5 factor), and wrapping the ˜S3 (which is inside the asymptotic S5 factor),
and ﬁlling the y, x1, x2 space at ﬁxed t, possibly up to some terminal 2d hypersurface in
that space where the minimal surface closes oﬀon the S3. The geometry preserves an
extra U(1) symmetry, because we have not broken the rotational symmetry in the x1 −x2
plane. The minimal surface will then be speciﬁed by some function θ(y, r) giving the polar
angle of the surface on the S3 at each y and r, with the boundary conditions θ →π/2 as
y2 + r2 →∞, and possibly ending at some hypersurface where θ(y, r) = 0.
By symmetry, one extremal surface in this class will be θ = π/2. But we do not expect
this to be the minimal surface.
Recall that in the previous section we found that the
minimal boundary-anchored surface in AdS5 × S5 for a boundary condition which cuts the
S5 in half is not the surface θ′ = π/2 which cuts the S5 in half everywhere. We argued that
it is instead a surface which pinches oﬀto θ′ = 0 near the boundary of the AdS factor. Now
recall that in the interior of the LLM geometry the S3 of the asymptotic AdS5 exchanges
– 12 –

JHEP11(2017)159
roles with an ˜S3 in the asymptotic S5. Since the surface θ = π/2 bisects the S3 along the
equator, in the IR AdS region it bisects the S5 factor. Given our reasoning about surfaces
that bisect the S5 in an AdS5 × S5 geometry, we should expect that we can we can lower
the area in the annulus geometry by allowing our candidate minimal surface to slip oﬀthe
S5 before it reaches the deep interior of the IR region.
In practice we need to be more careful; deforming the surface will increase the area
in the UV region (which dominates in volume), so we must take care that this does not
overwhelm the reduction from capping the surface oﬀ. To argue this we make use of the
intermediate metric, which has a domain of validity partially overlapping the domains of
validity of the UV AdS and IR metrics. We would expect the capping oﬀto happen in
this “neck” region, where we cross over from the UV AdS where θ = π/2 is minimal,
to the IR AdS where it is preferable to cap oﬀ.
We will show that there are surfaces
which cap oﬀin the intermediate regime, for which the deviation from θ = π/2 in the UV
region is suﬃciently small that the contribution of the UV region to the change in area is
parametrically smaller than the decrease in area coming from the intermediate regime.
The geometry in the intermediate regime preserves the same SO(6) ×SO(4) symmetry
as in the IR regime. It is useful to make this symmetry manifest by making the coordinate
transformation (3.4), so that the metric becomes
ds2
t=0 ≈ϵ

1 + e−4ζe2ζ(dζ2 + dθ
′2 + sin2 θ′dΩ2
4) + R(1 + e−4ζ)−1/2d˜Ω2
3.
(4.1)
In this coordinate transformation, θ = π/2 maps to θ′ = π/2. (The coordinate β in (3.4)
becomes part of the S4 metric dΩ2
4 in the above.) In the full LLM solution, we would expect
the minimal surface to involve a function of two variables, θ(r, y), which corresponds in
these coordinates to taking θ′(ζ, β). However, the enhanced symmetry in the intermediate
regime suggests that we can ﬁnd a minimal surface by taking θ′ = θ′(ζ), as in our previous
analysis of the IR regime. We will see below that the corrections from the UV regime for
the surfaces we consider are small, so this should be a good approximation to the actual
minimal surface.

UV contributions
We expect the minimal surface to approach θ′ = π/2 at large ζ, where we patch on to the
UV region. We therefore ﬁrst consider a linearized analysis in this regime. The solution
to the linearized version of (4.3) has the form θ′ −π/2 ∼−δ0e−aζ, with a = 4 or a = 1.
These are fast and slow fall-oﬀbranches, analogous to the familiar normalizable and non-
normalizable branches for a mode in AdS. We can expand (4.2) to quadratic order in δ0 to
approximate the gain or loss in area, and compare to the contribution in the UV region.
– 13 –

JHEP11(2017)159
If the surface approaches θ′ = π/2 at large ζ with a non-zero coeﬃcient for the a = 1
solution, the integral over ζ is dominated by large values of ζ, and the change in area from
the θ′ = π

While the solution appears to lower the area, we must also take the contribution from the
UV region into account. If we take y, r ∼ϵδR1−δ with 0 < δ < 1

comes from a region in which the UV metric is a very good approximation. The angular

(4.6)
If c′ is negative, then we arrive at a contradiction. We can simply cap the surface oﬀat
ζ ∼1, with a gain (ϵ5R3)1/2 ≪ϵR3 in area, so that the area remains negative. If we then
deform the metric to the pure AdS solution, the contribution of this cap remains small, and
we have a surface in vacuum AdS with area less than the θ = π/2 surface, contradicting
the discussion in section 3.1. Thus, if a solution exists with the a = 1 behavior in the
intermediate regime, it is not a minimal surface.
Instead, we will consider surfaces which approach θ′ = π/2 at large ζ with the fast fall-
oﬀ, that is a = 4. In this case, θ′ = π
2 −δ0e−4ζ, and the contribution from large ζ in (4.2)

mation breaks down (we will ﬁnd this happens while the metric is still well approximated
by (4.1)). Thus, for the a = 4 solutions, the contribution from the UV region is negligible,
and we can consistently calculate the change in area in the intermediate region.
One additional caveat, mentioned above, is that we assumed more symmetry in the
intermediate region than we expect the exact solution to have. This allowed us to write θ′
as a function of a single variable ζ. In general, due to the boundary matching that we must
do at large ζ, the solution will have the form θ′(ζ, β) (where β is a coordinate in the S4
with metric dΩ2
4 in (4.1)). However, we expect that this symmetry breaking will increase
the area in the intermediate regime. Thus, since the dominant change in area occurs in
the intermediate regime, and the deviation from θ −π/2 is small at the transition point

minimal surface which approaches θ′ = π/2 at large ζ in this LLM geometry.
to the UV metric, the symmetry-breaking component of the true minimal surface will be
suppressed. In other words, if we choose the surface in the intermediate region to only
depend on ζ we get a smaller area, and thus although some β dependence will be induced
by the matching with the UV, it will be suppressed since it is advantageous for the minimal
surface to depend to be a function only, or mostly, of ζ.
4.2
Minimal surface
We can ﬁnd extremal surfaces by solving the equation (4.3) numerically, with the boundary
condition that we approach the linearized solution with a = 4 at large ζ. We solve for
δ(ζ) = θ′ −π/2, taking the boundary condition (1/δ)(dδ/dζ) = −4 at some large radius
ζmax, and shoot in. The solutions are shown in ﬁgure 3.
We ﬁnd that the solutions have an interesting structure: the solution for generic values
of δ(ζmax) encounters a turning point where ∂ζθ′ →∞, and then an extremum where
∂ζθ′ = 0, and then returns to large ζ with θ′ →π/2. These generic surfaces do not satisfy
our boundary conditions, as they would intersect the boundary twice.
– 15 –

JHEP11(2017)159
Those surfaces whose deviation from θ′ = π/2 at ζmax is suﬃciently small that they
reach the IR region begin to oscillate around θ′ = π/2 as described by (3.12). The sur-
face’s deviation from π/2 grows exponentially until the linearized solution is invalid. The
candidate minimal surfaces arise for discrete values of the initial conditions, where the ﬁrst
turning point lies at θ′ = 0 or θ′ = π, and the surface smoothly caps oﬀ. If the solution hits
θ′ = 0 at ζ = ζ0, smoothness requires that ζ −ζ0 ∼(θ′)2 +. . . . Indeed, we can expand (4.3)
about θ′ = 0, ζ = ζ0 to ﬁnd θ′(ζ −ζ0) ∼(ζ −ζ0)1/2. Of the solutions which cap oﬀ, the
solution with the lowest area caps oﬀat the largest value of ζ, ζ = −1.37.
The minimal surface has an area 1.43
√
ϵ5R3 less than the θ = π/2 surface. As expected
from the general scaling argument, the reduction in area scales as
√
ϵ5R3. Thus, from
the analysis in the intermediate regime, which is reliable for the surfaces which approach
θ = π/2 in the UV on the fast fall-oﬀa = 4 branch, we learn that there is a surface in
the LLM annulus geometry which bisects the S3 of the AdS5 factor at inﬁnity at θ = π/2
which has smaller area than the surface that remains at θ = π/2 throughout. The surface
caps oﬀin the intermediate regime, at the edge of the region where the IR AdS metric
begins to be a good approximation. Thus, the minimal surface barely reaches the interior
IR AdS regime.

Discussion
We have found new examples of entanglement shadows in LLM geometries. We analysed
a speciﬁc example where the geometry is simple enough that we could approximately
determine the location of the minimal surface, but we expect this behavior to be more
general. The essential reason for the change in the minimal surface is that the S3 that our
minimal surface divides goes from having a volume which decreases as we moved inwards
through the UV region, to being essentially constant as we enter the IR region. When the
volume of the sphere is decreasing, the minimal area surface stretches across the ball, as in
ﬂat space. But when the volume of the sphere becomes constant, the minimal surface wraps
around the sphere at nearly constant radius, as on a cylinder. Thus we would expect that
such shadows would be seen in any LLM geometry where the volume of the S3 becomes
approximately constant in the interior. That is, for cases where there are one or more
white regions inside a black region.
Our story is not, however, completely generic. If we consider instead an LLM geometry
with two black discs, when the discs are well-separated we can treat the region near each
disc as an approximate copy of AdS5 × S5, and we would not expect there to be a shadow
region. There is also no reason to expect a shadow for small ﬂuctuations in the shape of
the AdS black disc geometry.
As we vary θ0, the location of the minimal surface jumps at θ0 = π/2 from passing
above the shadow region to passing below it. However, there is an extremal non-minimal
surface at θ = π/2 which passes through the shadow region. Each point in the shadow
region lies on such a surface for some choice of division of the boundary. Therefore it
would be very interesting if this non-minimal surface could be interpreted in terms of a
CFT observable, similar to the entwinement of [9, 14]. One of the advantages of conducting
– 16 –

JHEP11(2017)159
the analysis in the LLM context is that the dual CFT states are known precisely, so we
can explore the entanglement structure of these states and see if they lead to interesting
observables. The states correspond to Young tableaux, and it is intriguing to speculate that
the SN structure encoded in these tableaux could play a role here, as the SN symmetry of
the symmetric orbifold did in the entwinement story.
Another possibly related discussion is that in [24], which studies surfaces in a Coulomb
branch geometry in which SU(N) is broken to SU(m)×SU(N−m) where m, N are of similar
order. They construct surfaces that bisect the S5 factor at large radius (scales above the
symmetry breaking scale) and pass between the two IR AdS factors; whether the minimal
surface in this class enters one region, the other, or neither, depends on where one places
the cutoﬀ. They conjecture that surfaces passing between the two factors measure the
entanglement between the light ﬁelds associated with each unbroken gauge factor.
As the cutoﬀis removed, all of these surfaces bisect the S5 at the equator, as proven
in [23]. However, following our discussion above, none of these are minimal for any cutoﬀ;
there are always arbitrarily small extremal surfaces which only extend inward for a small
distance away from the cutoﬀsurface. In ﬁgure 3 of [24], these would be surfaces that
pass r = 0 at larger values of y than are shown. Nonetheless, the surfaces studied in [24]
are extremal, and as with the entwinement story there may be a plausible inerpretation in
terms of entanglement explicitly involving the matrix degrees of freedom of the theory.
