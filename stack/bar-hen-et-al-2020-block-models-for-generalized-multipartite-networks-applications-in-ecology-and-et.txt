Abstract:
Generalized multipartite networks consist in the joint observation of several networks
implying some common pre-speciﬁed groups of individuals. Such complex networks arise commonly
in social sciences, biology, ecology, etc. We propose a ﬂexible probabilistic model named Multipartite
Block Model (MBM) able to unravel the topology of multipartite networks by identifying clusters
(blocks) of nodes sharing the same patterns of connectivity across the collection of networks they are
involved in. The model parameters are estimated through a variational version of the Expectation–
Maximization algorithm. The numbers of blocks are chosen using an Integrated Completed Likelihood
criterion speciﬁcally designed for our model. A simulation study illustrates the robustness of the
inference strategy. Finally, two datasets respectively issued from ecology and ethnobiology are analyzed
with the MBM in order to illustrate its ﬂexibility and its relevance for the analysis of real datasets.
The inference procedure is implemented in an R-package GREMLIN, available on Github
(https://github.com/Demiperimetre/GREMLIN).

1 Introduction
Networks have become fundamental tools in various ﬁelds, such as biology, ecological
theory or sociology to name but a few. The statistical analysis aims to study the
structure of these networks by, for example, unravelling clusters or communities of
individuals (nodes) that shape the observed interactions (see Kolaczyk, 2009, for a
review).
The recent years have witnessed a growing interest for multilayer networks which
is a classic but a wide terminology for a set of related networks (see Kivel¨a et al. (2014)
or Pilosof et al. (2017) for a review of multilayer networks in ecology for instance).
Among others, multilayer networks encompass dynamic networks, that is, networks
evolving with time (see Kim et al., 2018, for a review), multiplex networks when

several types of relations are simultaneously studied on a common set of individuals
(see K´eﬁet al., 2016; Barbillon et al., 2017, for instance) and multipartite networks.
Multipartite networks are a generalization of bipartite networks. In a bipartite
network, the nodes (representing the interacting entities) are partitioned into two
disjoint sets and an edge links a node from one set to a node from the other set
(see Figure 1, left). In a multipartite network, the nodes are divided into more than
two sets and edges link entities from different sets (see Figure 1, middle). In what
follows, these pre-speciﬁed sets of nodes will be referred to as functional groups.
Such multipartite networks arise in ecology when studying the interactions between
several groups of species such as the interactions between plants and pollinators,
plants and ants, etc. (Pocock et al., 2012; D´attilo et al., 2016) or in biology when
analyzing networks issued from multi-omics datasets involving proteins, etc. (see
Pavlopoulos et al., 2018, for instance).
Generalized multipartite networks are an extension of multipartite networks:
the nodes are still partitioned into functional groups, but the interactions may
occur not only between different functional groups but also within some of the
functional groups. Ethnobiology (which is the scientiﬁc study of the relations between
environment and people) provides such generalized multipartite networks. One
of the problems of ethnobiology is to understand how social relations between
individuals (seed circulation in our example) may structure and guarantee biodiversity
in the cultivated crop species (see Thomas and Caillon, 2016, for example). As
a consequence, the network of interest has two types of nodes—namely farmers
and crop species—and we observe interactions between farmers and crop species
(who grows what) and inside the group of farmers (seed exchange). Marketing also
provides generalized multipartite networks when individuals are connected through
social networks and also interact with goods through their online purchases. Note
that the term ‘heterogeneous networks’ is also used in the literature to refer to
networks in which the nodes are of multiple types (see Huang et al., 2018, and
references there in).
Many statistical tools have been proposed to analyze simple or bipartite networks.
However, when individuals or biological entities are involved in several networks,

Block models for generalized multipartite networks  275
Statistical Modelling 2022; 22(4): 273–296
there is a strong need to propose statistical tools handling these networks jointly.
Moreover, each context leads to a particular complex network, involving bipartite
and/or simple networks, oriented and/or non-oriented networks, weighted and/or
binary interations. As a consequence, the statistical method must be ﬂexible enough
to be able to take into account the wide variety of existing heterogeneous networks.
These tools are an essential step towards a better understanding of the global
interaction systems at stake. The aim of this article is to propose a probabilistic
model suited for generalized multipartite networks.
A central issue in network analysis is to be able to cluster nodes sharing the
same connectivity patterns. To do so, two approaches are possible, either relying
on classical metrics detecting nestedness (Almeida-Neto et al., 2008), modularity
(Barber, 2007), etc., or adopting a probabilistic mixture strategy. Since the original
article by Snijders and Nowicki (1997), probabilistic mixture models—classically
referred to as stochastic block models (SBM)—have proven their efﬁciency when
aiming to cluster similar nodes based on their connectivity patterns without any
prior assumption on the patterns to be found (e.g., modularity, centrality, hierarchy).
Latent block models (LBM; Govaert and Nadif, 2003) are the extension of SBM for
bipartite networks, resulting in a bi-clustering of the nodes.
In this article, we propose a new probabilistic mixture model adapted to
generalized multipartite networks that we call Multipartite Block Model (MBM).
This model assumes that each functional group is partitioned into clusters gathering
nodes sharing the same connection behaviour in all the networks they are involved
in. The clusters are given by latent variables on nodes. This results is a mixture model
on dyads (pair of nodes).
Inferring the parameters of such a model with latent variables is a complex
task, since the likelihood cannot be computed in a closed form. We resort to a
Variational Expectation–Maximization (VEM) algorithm to estimate the parameters
and to provide the multi-clustering of the nodes. The crucial task of estimating the
numbers of clusters in each functional group is tackled through a model selection
procedure based on an adapted penalized likelihood criterion, namely Integrated
Completed Likelihood (ICL).
Related works Some extensions of standard descriptive tools—such as community
detection—to more complex networks have been proposed in the literature (see for
instance Yang and Leskovec, 2012; Gask´o et al., 2017). These metrics or descriptive
tools have the drawback of only searching for speciﬁc types of structures, contrary
to clustering methods based on probabilistic mixture models. LBM do exist for other
kind of multilayer networks. When the network is multiplex (i.e., when several types
of interactions are studied on the same set of nodes), the SBM has been extended
in K´eﬁet al. (2016) and Barbillon et al. (2017)by assuming a multivariate Bernoulli
distribution to model the set of multiple edges between two individuals. Arroyo
et al. (2019) also deal with multiplex network and propose a common framework
for different kind of latent space including the latent block structure. Extending the
SBM to a dynamic context where several snapshots of the networks at different time
points are available was proposed in numerous articles. The main difference between
these articles is whether the evolution is considered as discrete (Xu and Hero, 2014;

276  Bar-Hen et al.
Statistical Modelling 2022; 22(4): 273–296
Matias and Miele, 2017) or continuous (DuBois et al., 2013; Xin et al., 2017) in
time.
Sengupta and Chen (2015), Huang et al. (2018) and Wang et al. (2019) propose
latent space models for what they call heterogeneous networks which involve several
types of nodes. Sengupta and Chen (2015) and Huang et al. (2018) consider extension
of LBM to heterogeneous networks. Sengupta and Chen (2015) consider extensions
of the classical SBM and of the degree-corrected SBM, while Huang et al. (2018)
considers the mixed-membership SBM (Airoldi et al., 2008). Wang et al. (2019)
consider a continuous latent space such as the latent space model (Hoff et al., 2002)
for such networks. However, their heterogeneous networks correspond to a less
general structure than our generalized multipartite network since it assumes that any
pairs of nodes of any types may interact. Indeed, in our multipartite blockmodel a
type of nodes corresponds to what we call a functional group and we are able to
deal with datasets where not all the functional groups interact or where interactions
between some functional groups are not observed. Furthermore, the articles which
propose a clustering method impose the same number of clusters for each type of
nodes. Sun et al. (2009) consider another multilayer structure with a star network
schema which casts to our multipartite structure. The ecological dataset we consider
actually has this star network schema. On top of the more general class of multilayer
networks we can handle, we provide the MBM for a general class of distributions on
dyads and we allow the number of blocks to vary between functional groups. In order
to select the numbers of blocks, we propose an adapted model selection criterion and
a practical model selection algorithm that has satisfactory performances. These are
new contributions to this ﬁeld.
Outline of the article Section 2 is dedicated to the introduction of notations
supplying a ﬂexible tool to describe generalized multipartite networks. We also
provide a description of the two datasets of interest and illustrate the notations
on these speciﬁc cases. The block model for multipartite networks is described in
Section 3. In Section 4, the variational inference and the model selection procedure
are presented including the practical implementation of the algorithm. Numerical
illustrations of the robustness of the inference method are provided in Section 5.
Finally, the statistical analyses of the two datasets with discussion are presented in
Section 6. Perspectives are discussed in the last section. Note that this document is
accompanied with a Supplementary Material document divided into four parts: in
the two ﬁrst sections, the derivations of the update formulas for the VEM algorithm
and of the ICL criterion are provided; detailed estimates on the two datasets are given
in the third section and additional simulations are provided in the last section.
2 Notations and data
A generalized multipartite network can be seen as a collection of networks involving
Q functional groups: each network may be simple, that is, describing the relations
within a given functional group or bipartite, that is, describing the relations between
individuals belonging to two different functional groups. Moreover, each network

Block models for generalized multipartite networks  277
Statistical Modelling 2022; 22(4): 273–296
may be binary or weighted. We develop a general framework able to handle any type
of multipartite network.
Let nq be the number of individuals in the qth functional group (q = 1, . . . , Q).
We index the collection of networks by pairs of functional groups (q, q′) (q and q′ in
{1, . . . , Q}). E denotes the list of pairs of functional groups for which we observe an
interaction network.
For any (q, q′) ∈E, the interaction network is encoded in a matrix Xqq′ such that
Xqq′
ii′ ̸= 0 if there is an edge from unit i of functional group q to unit i′ of functional
group q′, 0 otherwise. Each network may be binary (Xqq′
ii′ ∈{0, 1}) or valued (Xqq′
ii′ ∈N
or R). Xqq may be symmetric if the relation is non-oriented, non-symmetric otherwise.
X =

Xqq′
(q,q′)∈E denotes the generalized multipartite network.
For
each
network,
Sqq′
is
an
additional
notation
which
refers
to
the
collection
of
all
the
observed
dyads.
As
an
example,
if
Xqq
represents a completely observed undirected network without self-loop then
Sqq =

(i, j) ∈{1, . . . , nq}2, i < j

;
if
Xqq′
is
a
completely
observed
bipartite
network then Sqq′ =

(i, j) ∈{1, . . . , nq} × {1, . . . , nq′}

. If some dyads are not
observed
(i.e.,
missing),
then
we
set
Xqq′
ii′ = NA
and Sqq′
is
a
subset
of

(i, j) ∈{1, . . . , nq} × {1, . . . , nq′}

. In what follows, any matrix Xqq′ may contain
missing entries. The inference remains valid in spite of the missing data provided that
they are missing at random. In this case, the whole inference is only based on the
likelihood corresponding to the observed dyads (Rubin, 1976; Tabouy et al., 2020).
Illustration • The dataset 1 is issued from D´attilo et al. (2016). This ecological
network gathers mutualistic relations between plants and pollinators, plants and ants,
and plants and frugivorous birds, resulting in Q = 4 functional groups, namely plants
(q = 1), pollinators (q = 2), ants (q = 3) and birds (q = 4 and E = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)}.
X1q′
ii′ = 1 if the plant species i has been observed at least once in a mutualistic
interaction with the animal species i′ of functional group q′ during the observation
period, 0 otherwise. Dataset is available online.
• The dataset 2 comes from Thomas and Caillon (2016) and Thomas et al. (2015).
They collected the oriented network of seed circulation between farmers—resulting
in a non-symmetric adjacency matrix—and the crop species grown by the farmers,
resulting in an incidence matrix. Noting q = 1 for the farmers and q = 2 for crop
species, we get E = {(1, 1), (1, 2)}. X11
ii′ = 1 if farmer i gives seeds to farmer i′ (oriented
relation), 0 otherwise and X12
ij = 1 if farmer i cultivates crop species j, 0 otherwise.
3 A block model for generalized multipartite networks
We propose a global stochastic model for the multipartite network accounting for
heterogeneity of connection. To do so, we resort to a mixture model explicitly
describing the way edges connect nodes in the various networks.

Clustering
The heterogeneity is introduced through blocks: We assume that each
functional group q is divided into Kq blocks (or equivalently clusters). ∀q ∈{1, . . . , Q}
and ∀i ∈{1, . . . , nq}, let Zq
i be the latent random variable such that Zq
i = k if individual
i of functional group q belongs to cluster k. The random variables Zq
i ’s are assumed
to be independent and such that: ∀k ∈{1, . . . , Kq}, ∀q ∈{1, . . . , Q}, ∀i ∈{1, . . . , nq}:
P(Zq
i = k) = πq
k,
(3.1)
with πq
k ∈[0, 1], ∀k = 1, . . . , Kq and Kq
k=1 πq
k = 1, ∀q ∈{1, . . . , Q}. We set Zq =

Zq
i

i∈{1,...,nq}, Z =

Zq
q∈{1,...,Q} and π =

πq
k

k∈{1,...,Kq},q∈{1,...,Q}.
Connection
Conditionally to the blocks they belong to, the nodes connect as follows:
∀(q, q′) ∈E, ∀(i, i′) ∈Sqq′,
Xqq′
ii′ |{Zq
i = k, Zq′
i′ = k′} ∼ind Fqq′(αqq′
kk′).
(3.2)
The so-called connection distribution Fqq′ must be adapted to the relation represented
in Xqq′. For any (q, q′), Fqq′ may be either:
• the Bernoulli distribution of parameter µqq′
kk′ if the relation in Xqq′ is binary (and
so αqq′
kk′ = µqq′
kk′ is the probability of connection),
• or the Poisson distribution with mean αqq′
kk′ = µqq′
kk′ if Xqq′ is a counting weighted
network,
• or
the
Gaussian
distribution—with
αqq′
kk′ = (µqq′
kk′, σqq′
kk′)—if
Xqq′
encodes
a
continuous strength of interaction,
• or ﬁnally the Zero Inﬂated (ZI) Gaussian distribution if Xqq′ encodes a continuous
strength of interaction with possibly null interactions (the density function of
which is: f(x) = 1{0}(x)p + 1R∗(x)(1 −p)φ(x; µ, σ) with φ the Gaussian density).
In this case, αqq′
kk′ = (µqq′
kk′, σqq′
kk′, pqq′
kk′).
For any (k, k′, q, q′), dqq′ = dim(αqq′
kk′). We refer to α = (αqq′
kk′)(k,k′),(q,q′)∈E as the
connection parameters. αqq′
kk′ drives the interaction of any entity belonging to cluster
k in functional group q with any entity belonging to cluster k′ in functional
group q′. Note that for a bipartite or an oriented network Xqq′, (k, k′) ∈Aqq′ with
Aqq′ = {1, . . . , Kq} × {1, . . . , Kq′}. If the interaction encoded in Xqq is non-oriented,
then αqq′
kk′ = αqq′
k′k and so (k, k′) ∈Aqq =

(k, k′) ∈{1, . . . , Kq}| k ≤k′2.
Equations (3.1) and (3.2) deﬁne the so-called MBM.

Remark 3.1.
Our model is a generalization of the SBM and the LBM. Indeed,
Equations (3.1)–(3.2) reduce to the SBM if E = {(1, 1)} and to the LBM if E = {(1, 2)}.
Our extension assumes that the latent structures Z are shared among the Xqq′,that is, if
a functional group q is at stake in several Xqq′, the same Zq impacts the distributions of
the corresponding interaction matrices. In other words, the clusters gather individuals
sharing the same properties of connection in the collection of networks. Obviously,
if each functional group appears in only one element of E, the MBM reduces to
independent SBMs or LBMs.
In terms of probabilistic dependence, conditionally on Z, the

Xqq′
ii′

are
independent. However, Z being latent, their marginalization introduces dependence
not only between the Xqq′
ii′
but also between the matrices

Xqq′
(q,q′)∈E. As a
consequence, the clustering variables (Zq
i )q∈{1,...,Q},i ∈{1,...,nq} are dependent once
conditioned by X.
For a given vector of numbers of blocks K = (K1, . . . , KQ), let θK = (α, π) be the
unknown parameters of the MBM. We have to perform two inference tasks: ﬁrst, for
a given K, estimating θK and Z, second, selecting the adequate number of blocks in
each functional group K.
4 Parameter inference and model selection
Let p(X, Z; θK) denote the complete likelihood of the observations X and the latent
variables Z for parameter θK. Equations (3.1) and (3.2) lead to:
log p(X, Z; θK) = Q
q=1

(4.1)
where f qq′ is the log-density of Fqq′. The likelihood p(X; θK) is obtained by integrating
p(X, Z; θK) over all the possible values of Z denoted Z = {(zq
i )i∈{1,...,nq},q∈{1,...,Q}|zq
i ∈
{1, . . . , Kq}}:
log p(X; θK) = log

Z∈Z
p(X, Z; θK).
(4.2)
The summation over Z in Equation (4.2) becomes quickly computationally
intractable when Kq’s and/or the nq’s increase. Moreover, we are interested in inferring
the clusterings Z.

4.1 Variational EM algorithm
In such models with latent variables, the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977)
is a standard tool to maximize the likelihood, taking advantage of the simple
form of log p(X, Z; θK). However, when conditioned by the observations X, the
(Zq
i ) are not independent (see Remark 3.1). As a consequence, the E step of
the EM algorithm—which consists in the integration of log p(X, Z; θK) against
p(Z|X; θ′
K)—becomes quickly intractable. The VEM algorithm has proved to be a
powerful tool for maximum likelihood inference (see Govaert and Nadif, 2008;
Daudin et al., 2008) for the SBM and the LBM. The VEM replaces p(Z|X; θ′
K) by
an approximation RX,τ sought among distributions enforcing independence between

The details of the VEM algorithm are provided in the supplementary material
(Section A1). As for any EM-type algorithm, its initialization is critical and will be
discussed later. (ˆθK, ˆτ) denotes the VEM estimates. A by-product of this algorithm
is an approximation of the conditional distribution p(Z|X; ˆθK) by RX,ˆτ. Z is thus
estimated by:
ˆZq
i = arg max
k∈{1,...,Kq}
ˆτq
ik.
(4.4)
The consistency of the VEM estimates has been established for the SBM by Bickel
et al. (2013) and the LBM by Brault et al. (2017), while Mariadassou and Matias
(2015) study the behaviour of p(Z|X; ˆθK) for the same models.
4.2 Selecting the number of blocks
In practice, the number of clusters K = (K1, . . . , KQ) is unknown and its inference is
challenging. We propose to adopt a model selection strategy. To do so, we ﬁrst develop
a penalized likelihood criterion, extending the Integrated Completed Likelihood (ICL)
originally proposed by Biernacki et al. (2000)—and applied to blocks models by
Daudin et al. (2008), Keribin et al. (2014) and Mariadassou et al. (2010)—to the
MBM. We then propose a strategy to explore the set of the possible models.
4.2.1
A penalized likelihood criterion
The ICL criterion derives from an asymptotic approximation of the marginal
complete likelihood log m(X, Z) = log

θK p(X, Z; θK)p(dθK) where p(dθK) is a prior
distribution on θK.
Proposition 1.
Assume that X and Z are observed. Let p(θK) be a prior distribution
on θK. Then
log m(X, Z) ≈nqq′→∞max
θK
log p(X, Z; θK) −pen(MK)

with |U| the cardinal of U.
Proposition 1 is proven in Section A2 of the supplementary material.
In the context of blocks models, the latent variables Z are not observed. Biernacki
et al. (2000) propose to input its Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation ˆZ =
arg maxZ p(Z|X, ˆθK), resulting in the following penalized likelihood criterion:
ICL(MK) = log p(X, ˆZ; ˆθK) −pen(MK).
(4.6)
Finally, the best model is chosen as ˆK = arg maxK ICL(MK).
Note that the penalty term pen(MK) (Equation 4.5) is made up of two parts.
Q
q=1(Kq −1) log(nq) corresponds to the clustering distribution and involves the
number of nodes, while the other term depends on the number of unknown
connection parameters |Aqq′| and the number of observed dyads |Sqq′|.
Link with BIC and behaviour of the ICL
Mariadassou and Matias (2015) prove that in
the standard SBM, the posterior distribution p(Z|X; ˆθK) asymptotically concentrates
on the MAP ˆZ. As a consequence,
log p(X, ˆZ; ˆθK) ≈Ep(Z|X,ˆθK)

log p(X, Z; ˆθK)

= log p(X; ˆθK) −H(p(Z|X, ˆθK)),
where H is the Shannon entropy. Thus, ICL(MK) can be reformulated as: ICL(MK) =
log p(X; ˆθK) −H(p(Z|X, ˆθK)) −pen(MK) where the quantity log p(X; ˆθK) −pen(MK)
is similar to a BIC criterion. Thus, ICL can be seen as a penalized maximum
likelihood, where the penalty includes not only the complexity of the model pen(MK)
but also the entropy.
Consequently, ICL will automatically favour clustering conﬁgurations with well
separated groups. In practice, ICL has proven its capacity to outline the clustering
structure in networks in Daudin et al. (2008) for simple networks, Keribin et al.
(2014) for bipartite networks, Mariadassou et al. (2010) for valued networks and
Barbillon et al. (2017) for multiplex networks. Its success comes from the fact
that when traditional model selection criteria essentially involve a trade-off between
goodness of ﬁt and model complexity, the ICL values not only goodness of ﬁt but
also clustering sharpness.

Model selection algorithm
Using this criterion, one should be able to compare all the possible models, that
is, Q
q=1 K⋆
q models if assuming that Kq ∈{1, . . . , K⋆
q}. However, in practice, the ICL
relies on the VEM which requires several clever initializations to avoid local maxima.
In order to tackle these two issues, we propose to adopt a stepwise procedure.
More precisely, at iteration (m) of the procedure, given a number of blocks K(m) and
its corresponding clustering ˆZ
(m), we propose to estimate the parameters of all the
models with one more and one less block. For the models with one additional block,
the VEM is run from several initial points obtained by splitting one of the previous
blocks (given by ˆZ
(m)). For the models with one less block, the VEM is initialized on
several clusterings derived from ˆZ
(m) by merging pairs of blocks. At each iteration, the
models are compared through their ICL and the best deﬁnes K(m+1). The procedure
stops when the ICL does not increase anymore.
Model selection strategy for MBM
Given a current model M(m) = M(K(m)

(m), the
mth iteration of the procedure is written as follows.

q(m) into two clusters (the two clusters are obtained by a hierarchical clustering).
· From each of the K(m)

bound of the likelihood (4.3).

Like any stepwise procedure, our algorithm is clearly suboptimal in terms of model
space exploration. However, it reveals to be efﬁcient in practice. Indeed, initializing
the VEM from the clusters obtained on a smaller or larger model is much more
efﬁcient than other strategies such as random initialization or spectral clustering.
The (possibly local) maximum is reached in a few iterations, resulting in a reasonable
computational time. Moreover, the tasks at each iteration can be parallelized resulting
in an additional saving of time. In addition, the model selection algorithm may be
initialized on several starting models M(0) like M(0) = (1, . . . , 1) or the clusterings
obtained by inferring the structure of the networks Xqq′ separately.
The complete inference procedure including the model selection algorithm is
implemented in the R package GREMLIN.

On each simulated dataset, we run the algorithm described in Section 4.2.2 with
K⋆
q = 10, for all q. We start the stepwise algorithm on Kq = 1 and on the clusterings
obtained by inferring the LBM separately on each matrix Xqq′. For each dataset, it
takes a few minutes for the algorithm to converge.
Results for Scenario 1
Among the 100 simulated datasets, the true numbers of clusters are exactly
recovered for 73 datasets as can be seen in Table 1. Three other estimated
conﬁgurations are observed as detailed in Table 1, each of them corresponding to
ˆKq = Kq −1. A scrutiny shows that cases where K3 is estimated to 1 instead of 2
correspond to datasets where one simulated cluster (meaning the simulated Z3) is
reduced to 1 or 2 individuals.
We measure the ability of the procedure to recover the clusters by computing
the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI by Hubert and Arabie, 1985) between ˆZ
1 and the
simulated Z1. ARI compares two clusterings with a correction for chance. It is close

Figure 2 (a): Simulation scenario 1: Distribution of the ARI for q = 1 when ˆK1 = 6 (under-estimation) on left
and ˆK1 = 7 (exact estimation) on right. (b) Simulation scenario 2: Boxplots of the ARI for ˆZ
1 (on left) and ˆZ

(on right) with ˆK1 = 2 (circle) and ˆK1 = 3 (triangle)
to 0 when the two clusterings are independent and equals to 1 when the clusterings
are identical (up to label switching). The boxplots of the ARI’s are plotted in Figure
2a. All the ARI are high (> 0.7), even when ˆK1 = 6, which means that the clusters
are always globally recovered and the structure of the multipartite network is well
discovered.
We also investigate the quality of the parameters estimation. For the 73 datasets
such that ˆK = (7, 2, 2, 1), we compare the estimated parameters ˆα to the simulation
parameters (after a relabelling of the clusters to match the true clustering, if required).
The results in terms of bias and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are reported in
Table 2. We observe that the parameters are estimated without noticeable biases and
with small RMSE. In particular, the null αqq′
kk′’s are always recovered.
Results for Scenario 2 The same analysis is done for Scenario 2. ˆK = K = (3, 2)
for 82 simulated datasets over 100. The unique alternative observed conﬁguration is
ˆK = (2, 2).
Here again, in order to assess the ability of the method to recover the clusters, we
compute the ARI for Z1 and Z2. These quantities are reported in Figure ?? for the
two functional groups (left and right) and for ˆK1 = 3 (triangles) and ˆK2 = 2 (circles).
As can be noticed, the clusterings are well recovered when the number of clusters
are exactly recovered (triangle), with a noticeable number of cases where the clusters
are exactly recovered (ARI = 1). As expected, we observe a lower ARI when ˆK1 = 2
(circle), but with globally high values.

Additional simulations
Additional simulations, available in supplementary material, were run for our
two scenarios to see how the clustering improves depending on the networks we take
into account. The improvement is especially noteworthy for the functional groups
which are involved in several networks (plants in scenario 1, farmers in scenario 2).
This was expected since some parts of the block structure are more related to some
interactions with speciﬁc functional groups.
6 Applications
6.1 Ecology: Interactions plants/animals
Dataset The dataset—compiled and conducted by D´attilo et al. (2016) at Centro de
Investigaciones Costeras La Mancha (CICOLMA), located in Mexico—involves three
general types of plant–animal mutualistic interaction: pollination, seed dispersal by
frugivorous birds, and protective mutualisms between ants and plants with extraﬂoral
nectaries. The dataset includes n1 = 141 plant species, n2 = 173 pollinator species
(ﬂower visitors), n3 = 46 frugivorous bird species and n4 = 30 ant species, inducing
753 observed interactions of which 55% are plant–pollinator interactions, 17% are
plant–birds interactions and 28% are plant–ant interactions.
Inference We run the procedure described in subsection 4.2.2. The computational
time on an Intel Xeon(R) CPU E5-1650 v3 3.50GHz x12 using 6 cores is less than
10 minutes. The ICL criterion selects 7 clusters of plants, 2 clusters of pollinators,
1 cluster of birds and 2 clusters of ants. The estimated parameters are reported in
Tables A1 and A2 in the supplementary material. The resulting mesoscopic view of
the multipartite network is plotted in Figure 3.
Discussion From Figure 3, we conclude that plants of Clusters P7 and P1 only
interact with ants (plants of Cluster P7 attract more ant species belonging to Cluster
A1). The plants of Clusters P3 and P6 are only in interaction with birds, the difference
between the two clusters being due to the strength of the connection. The difference
between the two clusters of ﬂower visitors (pollinators) F1 and F2 derives from the
existence of Cluster P5 of plants.

Figure 3 Mesoscopic view of the interconnected network. The size of the nodes is proportional to the size
of the clusters and the width of the edges are proportional to the probability of connection between/within
clusters. Edges corresponding to probabilities of connection lower than 0.01 are not plotted. The letter in
the cluster name corresponds to the ﬁrst letter of the name of the functional group
In order to illustrate the contribution of our method, we also analyze each bipartite
network separately (using an LBM) and compare the results in terms of clustering.
The clusterings are compared through the ARIs, provided in Table 4.
Using standard LBM, we obtain 2 clusters of ants, 1 cluster of birds and 3 clusters
of pollinators. The clusterings of ants and birds are not modiﬁed by the ecosystemic
approach (ARI = 1). The clustering of the pollinators is slightly modiﬁed, going
from 3 clusters to 2 clusters, but the additional block only contains few individuals,
thus leading to a high ARI. Since the plants functional group is involved in the
three bipartite networks, we obtain three clusterings when analyzing them separately.
These three clusterings are—as expected—very different from our MBM clustering
(the ARIs being respectively equal to 0.118, 0.415 and 0.163, see Table 4). When
aiming at proposing a clustering taking into account the three bipartite networks,

one may adopt a naive strategy by combining (by intersection) these three clusterings.
We then obtain 12 blocks of plants and the ARI with the MBM clustering is 0.617.
However, this number of clusters (12) is too large with respect to the model selection
criterion. Our MBM clustering is a parsimonious trade-off.
Finally, Figure 3 highlights the central role played by the pollinators in the
complete network also involving ants and seed dispersal birds. Our ecosystemic
approach unables us to unravel such a central position of pollinators in general with
respect to ants and seed dispersal birds, which would have been impossible when
performing separate analysis.
6.2 Seed circulation and crop species inventory
Dataset Seed circulation among farmers is a key process that shapes crop diversity
(Coomes et al., 2015; Pautasso et al., 2013). Data on seed circulation within a
community of ﬁrst-generation migrants (30 farmers) were collected by a ﬁeld survey
in the island of Vanua Lava in the South Paciﬁc archipelago nation of Vanuatu. A
farmer is considered as a giver for another farmer if he/she has given at least one crop
since they arrived in the new settlement site in Vanua Lava. It results in a connected
and directed network of seed circulation. Besides the circulation network, inventory
data for each farmer were also collected. They consist in the list of crop landraces
they grow. This was aggregated at the species level, leading to 37 crop species. These
inventory data can be seen as a bipartite network. The seed circulation data were
analyzed in Thomas and Caillon (2016) and the inventory data were analyzed in
a meta-analysis in Thomas et al. (2015). On the basis on the joint modelling we
propose in this article, we aim to provide a clustering on farmers and crop species
on the basis of the seed circulation network and the inventory bipartite network.
Inference Three clusters of farmers and two clusters of crop species were selected.
The inferred parameters are given in Table A3 in supplementary material and a
mesoscopic view is displayed in Figure 4. The clusters were renumbered to make
them correspond to the probability of connection: the larger cluster number, the
larger marginal probability of connection for the members of the cluster.

290  Bar-Hen et al.
Statistical Modelling 2022; 22(4): 273–296
Discussion The discovered clusters are straightforwardly interpretable: Cluster
F3 gathers farmers who circulate seeds within the cluster and give to the two other
clusters, Cluster F2 circulates seeds within the cluster contrary to Cluster F1 who
only receives from Cluster F3; the two clusters of crop species are Cluster S2 with
more common crop species and Cluster S1 with other species. Clusters F3 and F2 of
farmers grow crop species from Clusters S1 and S2, whereas Cluster F1 of farmers
grows mainly crop species from Cluster S2. It turns out that Cluster F3 gathers mainly
the ﬁrst migrants and Cluster F1 the last migrants. The pattern of connection is then
explained by the fact that ﬁrst migrants helped the others to settle by providing seeds.
Moreover, the ﬁrst migrants had more time to collect more crop species to grow. In
order to compare the clusterings obtained by the MBM and the ones obtained from
the circulation network (clustering on farmers from SBM) and the inventory network
(clusterings of farmers and plants with an LBM), we compute the ARI. The clusterings
on crop species remain quite close since their ARI is equal to 0.891. However, the
clusterings on farmers are quite different (ARI smaller than 0.3), indeed the MBM
shall make a trade-off between the circulation and the inventory for farmers. To
ease the comparison between clusterings on farmers, the same renumbering rule was
applied for all the different clusterings so that the larger cluster numbers correspond
to larger marginal probability of connection. Figure 5 is an alluvial plot which
compares the three obtained clusterings of farmers. It shows how the trade-off is
made between the two stand-alone clusterings in the MBM clustering. It appears
quite obvious that Cluster F1 given by the MBM gathers only farmers from Cluster
1 in the seed circulation network and from Clusters 1 and 2 from the inventory data
since this cluster aggregates farmers with fewer connections and who grow less crop
species than the others. The same kind of observation can be made for Cluster F3
given by the MBM which aggregates farmers who were in the cluster of the most
connected farmers and in the two clusters of farmers who grow more seed.
6.3 MBM validation on the two datasets
In order to validate the model on the real datasets, we resort to a cross-validation
strategy. We compare the prediction accuracy of missing values outputted by our
MBM with the one outputted by SBMs or LBMS ﬁtted separately on the networks.
Since in most cases we achieve better prediction performance (measured through the
area under the ROC curve) with our MBM, this shows that the block structures
between the different networks are intertwined and then our MBM leverages it to
better recover the underlying structure. More details on this validation and detailed
results are available in the supplementary material.
7 Discussion
In this article, we proposed an extension of LBM and SBM which can handle
multipartite networks, resulting in the so-called MBM. Multipartite networks

Figure 4 Summarized network provided by the MBM. Nodes correspond to the clusters detected by the
MBM: Clusters of farmers are in red and clusters of crop species are in green. Size of a node is proportional
to the number of farmers or crop species belonging to the considered cluster. The width of the edges is
proportional to the probability of connection between/within clusters. The probability of connection below
0.2 are not plotted. The letter in the cluster name corresponds to the ﬁrst letter of the name of the
functional group
encompass a lot of various situations such as the two examples dealt with in the
article. Besides, MBM can be also useful for many other contexts with different
multipartite structures. The main limiting factor of the parameter inference and
model selection methods we propose is the size of networks. Indeed, the inference
algorithm is suitable for networks up to 1 000 nodes in order to keep computational
time reasonable. If willing at studying larger networks, one should develop adapted
inference algorithms.
Several extensions can be thought of with no additional signiﬁcant difﬁculty. For
instance, covariates can be taken into account by writing P(Xqq′
ii′ = 1|Zq
i = k, Zq′
i′ =
k′) = φ

αqq′
kk′ + yqq′

where yqq′
ii′
are the covariates describing the pair of individuals
(i, i′). A more challenging extension could be to include extra parameters in the model

Figure 5 Alluvial plot comparing the clustering on farmers obtained from an SBM on the circulation
network (Circ.Net), an LBM on the inventory network (Inv.Net) and the MBM (MBM) on both networks. The
cluster numbers are related with the probability of connection; the larger cluster number, the larger
marginal probability of connection (between farmers for Circ.Net, between farmers and crop species for
Inv.Net)
to account for degree heterogeneity in the vein of the degree-corrected SBM (Karrer
and Newman, 2011). However, this should lead to cluster individuals independently
of their degrees which is not always desirable. For instance in the seed circulation
example, the in-degrees and out-degrees of farmers are key factors to explain their
social structure. In the interaction networks in ecology, distinguishing generalist (high
degree) from specialist (low degree) species is a part of the expected outcomes of the
clusterings. More recent works (Zhu et al., 2014) propose to use node degrees and
edge orientations to help the clustering while tolerating heavy-tailed distribution of
degrees. Incorporating these variants may be of interest in the MBM framework and
could lead to further developments.

In a more general perspective, the study of ecological or sociological interactions
supplies a wide variety of complex networks such as multilevel networks or multilayer
networks (Pilosof et al., 2017; Lazega and Snijders, 2015). Some of them can be
treated as multipartite networks and then by an MBM (possibly by incorporating
some extensions discussed above). The others require the development of suited
models which might also rely on a latent variable modelling. They will be the subject
of future works.
