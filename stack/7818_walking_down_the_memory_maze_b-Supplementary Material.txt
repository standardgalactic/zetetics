APPENDIX
A.1
PROMPTS
We provide full prompts for both memory tree construction and navigation described in §3.
A.1.1
MEMORY TREE CONSTRUCTION PROMPTS
We use two prompts for memory tree construction (the construction component of Table 5). The
ﬁrst (leaf) instructs the LLM to summarize the text segment into a comprehensive summary. Af-
ter this step, the segments are grouped and summarized into non-leaf node summaries. The sum-
maries ([CHILD SUMM NODE 0], [CHILD SUMM NODE 1], ..., [CHILD SUMM NODE N]) are
grouped and concatenated as the summary content of their parent node. During this process, if the
concatenated summaries exceed the predetermined length, the second construction prompt is used
to further summarize the text (i.e., [SUMMARIES]) for the parent node.
A.1.2
NAVIGATION PROMPTS
We use two navigation prompts (triage and leaf) as described in §3. We show the general prompt
template in the navigation stage of Table 5.
A.2
EXAMPLES
We provide an extra navigation example in Table 6.

Table 5: Prompts used for the memory tree construction stage and the navigation stage. For the
memory construction stage, [TEXT OF SEGMENT] is ﬁlled with the segment text at the leaf nodes.
[SUMMARIES] is the concatenated summaries from the child nodes and will be further summarized
if it exceeds the predetermined length. For navigation, [QUERY] is the query, [OPTIONS] are the
multi-choice options (only in QuALITY), [CHILD SUMM NODE n] represents the summary text
of the n-th child node, and [WORKING MEMORY] is the information carried from previous nodes.
Yellow indicates triage prompt and purple indicates leaf prompt, as described in §3.
Stage
Prompt
Construction (leaf)
[TEXT OF SEGMNET]. Summarize the above text comprehensively into a ﬂuent passage.
Construction (non-leaf)
[SUMMARIES]. Compress each summary into a much shorter summary.
Navigation (triage)
The following passage(s) are the summaries of the different parts of a story.
To answer the question: [QUERY]
Which of the following summary is MOST LIKELY to contain information about the answer?
First provide reasoning to compare the summaries before you make the decision.
Summary 0: [CHILD SUMM NODE 0]
Summary 1: [CHILD SUMM NODE 1]
. . .
Summary N: [CHILD SUMM NODE N]
Relpy with the passage number as your action.
You MUST choose one summary number and you should reply with the following format:
