ADVANTAGES
DISADVANTAGES
FABRIC MARKER
Makes clear and 
definite lines. Easy 
to use and remove.
Disappearing ink 
may fade too quickly 
or incompletely. 
Washable varieties 
may stain. Not suitable 
for darker fabrics.
FABRIC PENCIL
Makes crisp, 
water-soluble 
marks. Available in 
many colors.
Pressure needed to 
make marks may dis­
tort fabric. Marks not 
as bold as those made 
by markers.
TAILOR’S CHALK
Marks a wide 
variety of surfaces. 
Comes in solid, 
wheel, or pen 
forms.
Markings tend to rub 
or shake off with han­
dling. Can dry out and 
become more difficult 
to use with age.
TRANSFER PAPER

Straight Pins
All-purpose pins are sharp-pointed, about 0.6mm 
thick, and 1˝–2˝ long. Specialty pins vary in size and 
point style.
EXTRA FINE
For sheer or very delicate fabrics. Also called silk 
pins or satin pins.
BALL-POINT
Rounded tip specifically for knit fabrics
T-PIN
Thick, with a T-shaped head. For heavy fabrics such 
as upholstery.
APPLIQUÉ
Short and ideal for applying small trims and 
embellishments.
Pinhead style is mostly a matter of personal 
preference. Ball-shaped plastic heads are the most 
common, as they are easy to see and manipulate. 
Metal and glass heads are more heat-resistant. Flat 
plastic heads reduce bulk and distortion of fabric.

1. Insert a length of 
thread through the eye 
of the needle.
2. For single-thread 
stitching, tie a knot 
in one end and pull 
the thread so that 
the unknotted end is 
several inches away 
from the needle. For 
double-thread stitching, 
bring the ends together 
and tie a knot.
3. Insert the needle 
into the wrong side 
of the item and draw 
the thread through 
until the knot is at the 
insertion point.
4. Continue stitching 
and knot off at the end.

Stitches and Seams

Machine Stitches
The stitch-length setting controls how far a 
single stitch travels. A small stitch length (1) 
gives tiny stitches, and a large stitch length 
(4–5) gives long stitches.
Small stitch length
Large stitch length
The stitch-width setting determines the side-
to-side dimension of a stitch. Straight stitches 
have a width of 0, as there is no side-to-side 
movement. For a zigzag stitch, a small width 
setting (1) gives a narrow zigzag, and a large 
width setting (6–7) gives a wide zigzag.

Stitch Tension
Most stitching is done with a mid-range, balanced tension setting. 
The needle thread tension can be adjusted for different fabrics and 
stitch types. A high-tension setting gives tight stitches that are 
strong but more prone to breakage or puckering. A low-tension 
setting gives loose stitches that are useful for basting or gathering. 
The bobbin thread tension is generally not adjusted unless there is 
a problem with the stitching.
Balanced tension
Low needle thread tension or high bobbin thread tension
High needle thread tension or low bobbin thread tension
BASIC MACHINE STITCHES
STITCH
APPLICATION
Straight 
stitch
General piecing, topstitching, and 
zippers. Long, loose stitches are used 
for basting and gathering.
Zigzag stitch
Edge finishing, stretch stitching, and 
appliqué. Satin stitches are made with 
a very short stitch-length setting.
Tricot, or 
3-step zigzag 
stitch
Multipart zigzag stitch for topstitching 
and for edge finishing stretchy knit 
fabrics.
Overcast 
stitch
Stitch and edge finish seams simulta­
neously, much like a serger. Best used 
in conjunction with an overcast foot.
Blind hem 
stitch
Makes tiny stitches in the folded fabric 
to create nearly invisible stitching 
along a hem. 
Bridging or 
faggoting
Joins two pieces of fabric at the 
edges. Used in heirloom sewing.
Stretch stitch
Multistep straight stitch for sewing 
stretchy seams in highly elastic fabrics. 
Also used to reinforce seams.

Seam Allowances
The distance between the stitching and the raw 
fabric edge depends on the type of seam and the 
need for adjustment.
Relative Seam Width
Relative Seam Width
WIDTH
APPLICATION
5⁄8˝
Common in home sewing patterns, this 
wide allowance gives room for “letting 
out” seams. 
1/2˝
Gives space for a wide finish, such as over­
lock machine stitches and French seams.
³⁄8˝
Standard seam allowance in the garment 
industry (for minimal fabric waste). Gives 
some room for tailoring.
1/4˝
Preferred allowance for quilters. Also used 
in modern apparel patterns. Good for 
areas with curves or easing.
¹⁄8˝
Very small allowance that works only with 
nonfraying fabrics such as felt and leather. 
Wider allowances are often trimmed 
down to this size for better flexibility and 
reduced bulk.

Curved Seams
In quilting, this method is used to sew 
two curved pieces together within a 
two-dimensional design.
2. Match and pin the centers, 
with the right sides together 
and the convex piece on top.

1. Fold the pieces in half to 
locate the centers. Mark the 
folds with pins.
3. Match the corners at one 
end and pin.
4. Align and pin the edges 
in between.
5. Repeat on the other side.
6. Stitch the curved pieces 
together with a 1/4˝ seam, 
unless otherwise indicated. 
Use a straight stitch that is 
slightly longer than normal. 
Stitch slowly and use your 
fingertips to smooth out 
wrinkles as you go. Any 
puckers can be removed 
with a seam ripper and 
resewn.
7. Turn and press.
The matching process is 
similar to that of attaching 
a sleeve to a bodice in 
garment construction 
(page 106).

Machine Blindstitched Hem
Many sewing machines have a blind 
hem stitch (page 22). The hem edge is 
folded like a fan and stitched so that 
the widest part of the blind hem stitch 
barely catches the edge of the fold (A). A 
blindstitch sewn by a machine is almost 
invisible on the outside of the garment 
(B). There are many books and online 
tutorials to guide beginners.
Hem Width
Relative Hem Width
WIDTH
APPLICATION
Very wide
(>2˝)
A heavy hem gives the needed weight for draperies 
and long, full gowns. Also used in children’s wear 
for clothing that can be “let out” with growth.
Wide
(1˝–2˝)
Often found in tailored dresses and pants. Allows a 
garment to hang properly without adding excessive 
weight.
Medium
(1/2˝–3/4˝)
Common hem size for everything from knitwear 
to jeans. It is narrow enough to maneuver around 
tapers and flares and still hang nicely.
Narrow
(1/4˝–³⁄8˝)
Works well with light- to medium-weight fabrics. 
Appropriate for shirttail hems and flowing blouses. 
Often found on home decor items such as napkins 
and tablecloths.
Very narrow
(<1/4˝)
Great for thin, sheer fabrics such as georgette and 
organza. Most often found in the form of a rolled 
hem made using a specialized machine foot.
Hemming Hints
Hemming Knits
When hemming knits, be sure 
to use a stitch that will stretch 
with the fabric. Zigzag and 
tricot stitches are inherently 
stretchy, as are a number of 
the decorative stitches. To 
A
B
straight stitch, use a longer 
stitch length and lower the 
tension settings. Use 100% 
polyester thread for the needle 
thread and woolly nylon in the 
bobbin. Straight stitches made 

Stitches and Seams
31
Stitches  
and  
Seams
using a double needle are 
also quite stretchy and give a 
nice finish to knits.
Use a fusible or double-stick 
seam tape to set knit seams. 
This will make handling 
easier and will minimize 
stretching during stitching.
Hemming Bulky Fabrics
A single-fold hem (see 
Single-Fold Hem, page 29) 
is the best choice for bulky 
fabrics. To reduce bulk at 
the hem edge, hem tape or 
lace can be machine sewn 
to the raw edge of the fabric 
and then blindstitched to 
the garment (see Blindstitch 
Hem, page 20).
Hemming Garments
If you are working with a 
stretchy fabric or bias-cut 
design, it is best to let the 
garment hang overnight 
before marking the hem. 
Have the wearer try on the 
near-finished garment and 
mark the position of the 
bottom edge of the hem with 
one or more pins (if you are 
making the garment for 
yourself, enlist the help of 
another person). Determine 
the desired hem allowance 
and measure that amount 
down from the pin-marked 
finished length. Trim the 
fabric, making sure the 
cut is parallel to the floor.
Hand vs. Machine 
Blindstitching
Depending on the fabric, 
machine blindstitching 
may show through on the 
right side. To minimize the 
visibility of stitches, use 
matching thread and catch as 
little of the fabric as possible. 
For draperies and long, 
flowing gowns, the stitching 
may not be noticeable. For 
shorter, tailored skirts and 
dresses, hand stitching is the 
best way to get truly invisible 
results.
Hemming Curved Edges
Curves can be difficult to 
fold into smooth hems. For 
narrow, curved hems use 
your fingers and your iron to 
manipulate the fabric prior to 
stitching. With convex (hill-
shaped) curves, it is helpful 
to lightly gather the hem 
near the first fold line to ease 
the fold into place. Concave 
(valley-shaped) curves can 
sometimes be accommodated 
by gently stretching or 
lightly snipping the raw 
edge of the fabric. For wider 
curved hems, use bias tape 
(see Bias Tape, page 45) or 
create a facing that fits the 
curve exactly (see Adding 
Facings, page 103).

Fabric
Fiber Composition
Fabrics are made from either a single fiber type or a blend 
of two or more fibers. Natural fibers are derived from plants 
and animals, while synthetic fibers are polymers created 
by chemical processes. Fabrics made from 100% natural 
fibers are generally more comfortable and durable than their 
synthetic counterparts. Synthetic fabrics, however, are easier 
to care for and resist wrinkling. Blends often offer the best of 
both worlds.
Fiber Arrangement
Woven Fabric
The fibers in woven fabrics are interlaced at right angles. 
Woven fabrics do not stretch except on the bias (diagonal 
direction). Crispness and weight are factors of the fiber size 
and of the tightness and pattern of weaving.
Knit Fabric
Fibers in knit fabrics are looped together. Knits have the 
ability to stretch, and they resist fraying when cut. The 
amount of stretch depends on the type of fiber and the 
looping pattern. Double-knit fabrics are quite stable, while 
single knits, such as interlock and jersey, are moderately 
stretchy. Rib knits and Lycra blends have a lot of stretch. 
Knits are primarily used for garment sewing.
Felt
Fibers in felt are matted together. Felt can be shaped or sewn, 
and it does not fray.

Interfacing
Interfacings are classified as either fusible or sew-in. Fusible 
interfacings are ironed onto and become one with the fabric, 
making it easier to handle during the sewing process. It is 
important to choose a fusible interfacing that is compatible 
with the fabric and appropriate for the application—otherwise 
unsightly bubbles may appear on the right side of the item. Be 
sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding iron 
temperature and pressing time.
Sew-in interfacings are basted into place and/or stacked so 
they are between layers of fabric in the finished garment. 
They are the best option for fine or heat-sensitive fabrics, or 
where softness is preferred over crispness. Thin fabrics such 
as organza and batiste may also be used as sew-in interfacing.

Interfacing Fiber Arrangement
Interfacings are categorized as nonwoven, woven, and 
knitted. Weft insertion interfacings are a combination 
of knitted loops in one direction and woven threads in 
the other.
INTERFACING TYPE
PROPERTIES
Nonwoven
Most affordable and easy to find. Can be cut in 
any direction and does not fray or stretch.
Woven
Adds crispness and allows for shaping. Available 
in stretch and nonstretch varieties.
Knit
Suitable for use with both knit and woven fabrics, 
moves and drapes nicely, resists bubbling, and 
holds up well to laundering. 
Weft insertion
Drapes like a knit but has the stability of a woven. 
Can be textured for better adherence to textured 
fabrics.
Interfacing Weight
In apparel sewing, interfacing is lighter than the 
fashion fabric and is used to give body and/or stabilize 
specific parts of the garment, such as collars, cuffs, 
and facings. For accessories and home decor items, 
interfacing adds needed strength and weight, so it is 
often thicker than the face fabric. In fact, many of the 
heavyweight products are labeled as stabilizers rather 
than interfacings.

Other Fusible Products
Fusible webbing
Lightweight network of 
fibers, such as Wonder-Under 
(Pellon) and Stitch Witchery 
(Dritz), that adheres one 
layer of fabric to another.
Fusible adhesive
Similar to fusible webbing 
but in the form of a thin, 
solid sheet, such as 
HeatnBond (Thermoweb). 
Both are used for appliqué 
work and turn any fabric 
into a fusible interfacing. 
Fusibles can also be found in 
tape form for hemming and 
stabilizing seams.
Fusible fleece
Thick, soft batting-like 
material that can be adhered 
to fabric on one or both 
sides. Often used in handbag 
making and home decor, it 
provides structure similar to 
heavyweight interfacing but 
is soft and flexible. Products 
include 987F (Pellon), 9720-1 
(HTC), Fusible Warm Fleece 
(Warm Company), and Insul-
Fleece (C&T Publishing).
Fusible interfacing strips
Make It Simpler Fusible

Stuffing
Polyester Fiberfill
Poly fiberfill is the most widely available stuffing on the 
market. It is affordable and has a high loft, meaning it does 
not take much stuffing to fill a space. It can be difficult to 
stuff into small items such as dolls and plush toys because 
it does not pack well. For standard-sized pillows, prestuffed 
pillow forms are a good option (see Throw Pillows, page 77).
Natural-Fiber Stuffing
Stuffings made from 100% cotton or 100% wool tend to pack 
better and are ideal for dolls and stuffed animals.
Poly Pellets
Poly pellets add weight and can be used alone or as a base 
under fiber stuffing.

GATHERING, RUFFLES, BIAS TAPE, PIPING, AND TRIMS
Gathering
Marking Gathers
For accurate distribution of gathers, both the fabric to be 
gathered and the fabric to be attached should be divided into 
sections and marked.
Option 1
Notches are an 
efficient way to 
mark fabric, but 
they tend to get 
lost in the gathers 
in wide fabrics.
Option 2
Straight pins may 
be placed per­
pendicular to the 
fabric edge at the 
marking point, 
but take care that 
they don’t slip out 
during handling. 
Option 3
For fabrics that 
can withstand 
ironing and hold 
a crease, press 
marking can be 
used to make vis­
ible creases as ref­
erence points.

Straight-Stitch Gathering
TIPS
•• Position the gathering 
stitches so that the 
seam will fall right 
between them. For 
example, for a 1/2˝ seam 
allowance, place the 
gathering threads 1/4˝ 
and 3/4˝ from the edge.
•• Use a contrasting 
thread color in the 
bobbin.
1. Using a long stitch length 
and a loose tension setting, 
sew a row of gathering stitches 
near the edge. Sew a second 
row parallel to the first. Be 
sure to leave 2˝–3˝ tails at 
the beginning and end of 
each row.
Do not pull the needle 
threads once you have pulled 
the bobbin threads, or the 
stitching will lock and/or break.
NOTE
2. Grasp the bobbin threads and 
push the fabric toward the center 
on one side.
3. Grasp the bobbin 
thread on the other side and 
push the fabric toward the center.
4. The top edge of the gathered piece should be about 
the same length as the fabric to which it will be attached.
Zigzag-Stitch Gathering
1. Cut a piece 
of sturdy floss 
(embroidery or 
dental) longer 
than the edge. 
Pin at one end.
2. Using zigzag stitches (widest width 
and longest length settings), stitch near 
the edge of the fabric, with the floss 
centered beneath the presser foot. Stitch 
over the floss, not through it.
3. Gather as described for Straight-
Stitch Gathering (above), but grasp the 
floss rather than the bobbin thread.
Edge

Essential Sewing Reference Tool
42
Attaching Gathers
1. Pull the threads to make 
the gathered fabric the 
same width as the piece 
that will be attached to it.
2. Place the pieces right 
sides together and align the 
appropriate edges. Match 
the ends and the marking 
points and pin the layers 
together.
3. Evenly distribute the 
gathers and use additional 
pins to secure.
4. Stitch using 
the appropriate 
seam allowance 
and a normal 
stitch length 
and tension.
Avoid 
sewing over the 
basting stitches 
(straight-stitch 
method) or the 
floss (zigzag-
stitch method).
NOTE
5. After stitching, remove 
the pins and basting 
threads or floss.
6. Finish the raw edges 
with a zigzag or overlock 
stitch.
7. Press the seam 
allowance away from 
the gathered piece.
8. Optional: Set the seam 
allowance into place by 
topstitching along the 
seamline on the right side.

Hem the bottom edge of the 
ruffle prior to gathering. The 
most common hem finish is a 
thin double fold with straight 
stitching. Rolled hems are also a 
good option and can be covered with decorative thread 
using an overlock machine (see Rolled Hem, page 29).

Fold the ruffle strip in half length­
wise, wrong sides together, prior to 
gathering. The raw edges are at the 
top, and the fold is at the bottom. 
This method is good for reversible 
projects and for sheer fabrics.
Bias-Cut Ruffles
Cut the ruffle strip at 45° for 
a raw edge that does not fray 
and, therefore, does not require 
hemming. The resulting ruffle 
has a bit more body than one cut 
on the straight grain.

Essential Sewing Reference Tool
44
Ruffle Fullness
Ruffle fullness is described in terms of a “fullness factor.”
For example, a 40˝ strip gathered to 20˝ has a fullness factor 
of 2, which is often expressed as 2x because the starting 
fabric is twice as long as the finished ruffle (b). As the full­
ness factor increases, the gathering becomes tighter and the 
ruffle becomes “fluffier.” A ruffle with a fullness factor of 
1.25x (a) is slightly gathered, while a ruffle with a fullness 
factor of 4x (c) is tightly gathered.
Thin fabrics can be gathered to a much higher fullness 
than thick fabrics. Similarly, single-thickness ruffles can be 
gathered to a higher fullness than double-thickness ruffles. 
The fullness factor you select depends on the fabric, the type 
of ruffle, and where it will be used.
Fullness Factor = Starting Strip Length ÷ Gathered Ruffle Length
Desired Gathered Length × Fullness Factor = Starting Strip Length

Bias Tape
Pre-folded bias tape can be purchased in a 
range of widths and colors. It is convenient and 
relatively affordable, but the feel is a bit stiff and 
the color choices are limited. Bias tape can be 
made from most fabrics, giving the sewist more 
control over its color and texture.
Single-fold bias tape has its long edges folded in 
toward the center. It usually does not show on the 
outside of the item.
Single-fold bias tape
Double-fold bias tape has its long edges folded in 
toward the center and then is folded again in half 
lengthwise. It is often used to encase raw edges.

When covering straight edges, you can use straight-
grain tape (strips cut selvage to selvage) rather than bias tape. 
However, I prefer to use bias tape even on straight edges 
because I think it “hugs” the edge and moves better than 
straight-grain tape. In addition, the bias tape edges don’t fray 
during the attachment process.

5. This will yield 2 strips 
that are equal in length.
6. Continue cutting the 
folded square for more 
strips. Each set of strips 
will decrease in length.
7. Before joining the 2 strips, 
make sure the ends are cut 
at parallel 45° angles.
8. Place the strips right sides 
together and align the angled 
edges, leaving a 1/4˝ 
overhang on each side.
9. Stitch with a 1/4˝ seam allowance.
10. Press the seam allowance open.
11. Trim the seam

Applying Double-Fold Bias Tape
Navigating Curves with Bias Tape
It can be tricky to apply stretchy bias tape to concave and 
convex curves. Shaping and marking the bias tape first will 
help to make the application easier.
1. Open out 
the fold on the 
slightly narrower 
side of the tape.
2. With right sides together, align the 
opened edge of the tape with the edge 
of the fabric to be 
finished. Pin 
into place.
3. Stitch in the crease.
4. Fold the tape to the wrong side 
of the fabric. Half of the tape will 
show on the right side and half will 
show on the wrong side. Press.
5. Edgestitch into place on the right 
side. The stitching will catch the slightly 
longer edge on the back.
1. With right sides up, 
place the folded bias tape 
along the seamline of the 
curve. Press the tape to set 
the curve.
2. Use chalk to make 
alignment marks on the 
tape and the 
fabric.
3. Remove the tape and open out 
the chalk-marked fold. Extend 
markings to the edges of the tape 
and the fabric.
4. With right sides 
together, match the tape 
and fabric at the markings. 
Pin into place.
5. Stitch into place (see

Turning Square Corners 
with Bias Tape
1. Begin stitching the bias tape into place on one of 
the sides (see Applying Single-Fold Bias Tape, page 49, 
or Applying Double-Fold Bias Tape, page 50). Leave a 
“tail” of unstitched bias tape at the beginning.
2. Continue stitching the 
bias tape toward the corner, 
but stop a seam-allowance 
distance from the corner and 
backstitch.
4. Fold the tape down to make a fold 
in line with the top edge. Align the 
edge of the tape with the edge of 
the fabric.
5. Stitch into place.
3. Fold the tape up to make 
a 45° fold at the corner and 
pin into place.
6. Complete the 
other 3 corners 
in the same way.
7. When you return to the edge where 
you began, leave several inches of space 
between the start and stop points. Leave 
another tail of bias tape at the end.
8. Join the ends 
(see Connecting 
Ends of Bias 
Tape, page 52).
9. Fold the bias tape to the wrong side. 
From the wrong side, fold the tape into 
place at the first edge, 
arranging the fold at 
the corner into a 
45° angle.

Connecting Ends of Bias Tape
Piping
Piping is cording covered with bias strips. The bias strip 
width depends on the diameter of the cording and the desired 
seam allowance:
•• It is helpful to convert fractions into decimals and then 
convert the result back to fractions (see Decimals to Fractions, 
page 123). For example, to make piping with ¹⁄8˝-diameter cording 
and a 1/4˝ seam allowance: (.125 × 3) + (.25 × 2) = .875 (7⁄8˝)
•• For small curved items, piping seam allowances should be kept 
small (less than 1/4˝) for more accurate placement.
•• If the finished item will be washed, cotton cording should be  
preshrunk prior to covering.
NOTES
1. Apply the bias tape, 
leaving several inches of 
space between the stitching 
start and stop points. Leave 
tails of bias tape at the 
beginning and end.
2. Trim the tails to parallel 
45° angles that overlap by 
1/2˝ when the ends lie flat 
and in line with the edge of 
the fabric.
4. Finger-press the seam 
allowance open and trim 
the protruding points.
3. Lift the ends of the tape, right sides 
together, and join with a 1/4˝ seam. (See 
Cutting and Joining Bias Strips, Step 8, 
page 46.)
5. Fold and stitch 
into place.

1. Cut the bias strip or 
strips (see Cutting and 
Joining Bias Strips, 
pages 46 and 47).
2. Fold in half 
lengthwise, wrong sides 
together, and press.
3. Insert the cording into the fold so it is snug against the 
crease. Use a piping foot or a zipper foot to stitch as close 
to the cording as possible.
Inserting Piping into a Straight Seam
1. Lay out the fabric right side up. 
Align the raw edge of the piping 
seam allowance with the raw edge 
of the fabric. Pin into place.
2. Using a piping 
or zipper foot, baste 
into place over the 
piping stitching.
3. Place the second piece of fabric 
on top of the first, right sides 
together. Use the piping or zipper 
foot to stitch the layers together 
over the existing stitching.
4. Open out the 
fabric and fluff the 
piping.

Inserting Piping around Corners
1. To apply piping to 
square or rectangular 
items such as pillow 
covers and place mats, 
first round off any 
square corners. Lay 
out the top piece right 
side up.
2. Align the raw edge of the 
piping seam allowance with the 
edge of the item. Allow for a bit 
more piping than needed to go 
around the corners. It will looked 
“squished” and wrinkled at this 
point but will stretch out and lie 
nicely in the finished item.
3. Leave tails 
at the start 
and stop 
points and 
overlap them 
in a crisscross 
fashion.
5. Place the other piece of fabric on top and 
stitch into place. Leave an opening on one 
side for turning.
4. Stitch 
the piping 
into place, 
keeping the 
same seam 
allowance 
over the crossed ends.
6. Trim the crossed 
ends of the piping 
even with the seam 
allowance.
7. Turn right 
side out. Hand 
stitch the opening 
closed.

Trims
Flat Trims
Flat trims may be topstitched directly to 
a fabric or included in a seam. Examples 
include rickrack, lace, gimp, ribbon, and 
braiding.
Sewing Tips for Trims
If possible, apply trims prior to assembly so 
that the ends are contained within seams.
Mark flat trim placement with a crease or a 
thin marker line prior to application.
Pin or hand baste the trim into place along 
the marking. Depending on the weight of the 
trim, glue or double-stick basting tape may 
be used instead.
Don’t limit yourself to straight stitches for 
attaching trim. Zigzags are often easier to 
stitch and give a better hold, especially with 
thin trims. Decorative stitches can be used 
as well. Multiple rows of stitching may be 
required for wide trims.
Edgings
Edgings have a decorative edge and 
a utilitarian binding or allowance for 
attachment. They are designed to be 
included in a seam or positioned behind 
a hem but can be topstitched into 
place on the right side of an item if the 
binding edge is attractive. Examples 
of edgings include gathered lace and 
eyelet, corded edging, and pearl edging.

Essential Sewing Reference Tool
56
Sewing Tips for Edgings
1. To insert an edging into a seam, 
position the inside edge of the edging 
allowance on the seamline of the item 
before assembly. Pin the trim into place, 
leaving an overlap at the ends.
2. Stitch into 
place, starting and 
stopping about 1˝ 
on each side of the 
end meeting point. 
Trim so that the 
ends overlap by 1/2˝.
4. Stitch the 
unsewn trim 
into place.
3. Place the ends 
right sides together 
and stitch with a 
1/4˝ seam allowance.
5. Place the other 
piece of fabric on 
top and finish (see 
Inserting Piping 
around Corners, 
Steps 5–7, page 54).
When you are trimming square or rectangular items, thin 
edgings can be treated like piping (see Inserting Piping around 
Corners, page 54). For wider ruffled edgings, be sure to bunch 
the trim at the corners so that it will fan out properly in the 
finished item.

Fringes
Fringes have dangling elements attached to a woven strip. 
They can be placed behind a trim or topstitched into place. 
Examples include ball, brush, and beaded fringes.
Sewing Tips for Fringes
Trim the fringe at the ends, as needed, to work into seams. For 
shorter fringes, a zipper foot may be needed for installation.
Insertions
Insertions are designed to join two pieces of fabric and are 
often used in heirloom sewing. Usually lace or eyelet, they 
can be connected by seams or zigzag topstitching.
Sewing Tips for 
Insertions
As with any lace or 
eyelet, insertions have a 
right (prettier) and wrong 
(more knotty) side.

Zipper Length
If you are working with a separating zipper, purchase the 
exact length needed or tailor your project to fit a standard 
zipper size. For other types of zippers, if the exact zipper 
length is not available, purchase a zipper that is a bit longer 
than you need. To shorten it, before inserting the zipper add 
a simple bar tack over the zipper teeth where you want the 
zipper to stop. Then trim the zipper below the bar tack.

Zippers
59
Zippers
Stitching Zippers
Zippers usually include an extra 5/8˝ of tape 
above the top stop for finishing with a 5/8˝ seam 
allowance. If the seam allowance is narrower, 
you can trim the tape. If the zipper is applied to 
an item with a finished top edge, simply fold the 
excess zipper tape over to the wrong side prior to 
stitching.
The zipper foot allows for stitching as close as 
possible to the zipper teeth without interfering 
with the zipper movement. Since the foot is 
relatively narrow, stitching can be difficult to 
control, especially if the needle is set to stitch far 
away from the foot. For best results, premark the 
stitching position with either a washable marker or 
hand basting stitches. For best control, configure 
the foot and needle so that they will clear the 
zipper parts but keep the stitching as close to 
the foot as possible. For couture garments, hand 
stitching may be substituted to give a nearly 
invisible finish.
If the fabric will not hold a crease, use basting tape, hand 
stitching, or glue to hold the seam allowance folds in place.
When snipping seam allowances, be careful to keep the snips within 
the actual seam allowance.

Buttonholes
Sizing Buttonholes
For standard flat buttons, 
buttonholes should be about 1/4˝ 
larger than the button diameter. 
For thick or odd-shaped buttons, 
the buttonholes may need to be 
a bit larger. It is always best to 
make test buttonholes on scrap 
fabric first.
Buttonhole Placement
If you are working with a 
pattern, the button size and 
placement will be specified. 
For modifications or your 
own designs, here are a few 
guidelines to keep in mind.
Vertical buttonholes are used 
mostly on shirt plackets where 
there is not enough room for 
a horizontal buttonhole. Use 
horizontal buttonholes on most 
garments, particularly on those 
that are fitted or closely fitted.
This diagram is actual size and can be 
used as a gauge for measuring buttons 
or as a template for tracing buttonholes.

Buttonhole Spacing
If you are unsure of how 
many buttons to use, take a 
look at similar garments in 
your wardrobe.
1. Choose the number of 
buttons you want to use. 
Subtract 1 from this number 
to determine how many 
between-button spaces you 
will have.
2. Measure the placket from 
the top button position to the 
bottom button position.
3. Divide this measurement 
by the number of spaces to 
determine the length of the 
spaces.
Marking Buttonholes
1. If you are not using a premarked 
pattern, make a paper template that 
has properly spaced line drawings of 
the buttonholes.
2. Use a thick needle to pierce the 
pattern or template at the ends and 
centers of the buttonholes.
3. Align the pattern or template 
with the right side of the fabric and 
use a fine washable marker or chalk 
pencil to mark the fabric through the 
holes. Connect the dots.
4. Another option is to fold the 
pattern or template at the buttonhole 
line, place it on the garment next to 
the proper position, and mark just 
beside the fold.
Buttonhole Location
Buttons and buttonholes 
usually meet right at the 
centerline, unless 
the garment has an 
intentionally offset placket. 
For men’s garments, the 
buttonholes are on the right-
hand placket; for women’s 
garments, they are on the 
left-hand placket, as shown.

Stitching Buttonholes
The typical buttonhole is made of two rows of zigzag stitches 
flanked by bar tacks (wider and tighter zigzag stitches). The 
buttonhole slit is made after stitching.
Buttonholes can be made manually on 
a sewing machine by sewing zigzag 
stitches at the desired size and width 
settings. Most machines, however, come 
with preprogrammed buttonhole-making 
capabilities.
Four-Step Buttonholes
Usually found on basic mechanical sewing machines, the 
needle position and stitch width are preset for each step of 
the buttonholing process. The user determines the stitching 
length and duration.
One-Step Buttonholes
The change in stitch width and needle position occurs 
automatically when a part of the buttonhole foot bumps into 
a sensor on the machine. Buttonhole sizing is dependent on 
manual settings or the diameter of the button, which may be 
held in the foot during stitching. One disadvantage of the 
button-size method is that it does not take button thickness 
into consideration, so a larger button might have to be used 
as a stand-in to get a big enough buttonhole.
Zigzag stitching
Bar tacks
1. Sew a bar tack.
2. Zigzag stitch to form 
one side of the buttonhole.
3. Sew the 
second bar tack.
4. Zigzag stitch to form 
the other side of the 
buttonhole.

TIPS
•• Always place interfacing behind fabric before stitching 
buttonholes to prevent puckering and distortion of 
stitches. In most plackets and cuffs, interfacing is 
already sandwiched between the layers of fabric.
•• Use matching thread to minimize the appearance of 
imperfections.
•• Do not stretch or pull fabric during the buttonholing 
process. If the fabric seems to be “sticking,” use a 
layer of tear-away stabilizer under the item you are 
buttonholing.
•• After making the buttonholes, remove the markings 
following the manufacturer’s directions. Apply a touch 
of Fray Check to set the stitching. After it dries, use a 
pair of small sharp scissors to make the slit.
•• A seam ripper may be used to make the slit, but be 
careful not to cut the bar tacks. Pins may be placed 
through the bar tacks for extra protection.

Buttons
TIP: Thread
For a strong, secure attachment, sew on buttons with 
thick thread made specifically for buttons and crafts.
Attaching Flat Buttons
Flat buttons have two or four holes and are usually about 1/8˝ thick.
2. Insert about 24˝ of thread into a hand 
sewing needle. Match the ends and tie 
into 1 or 2 knots. Insert the needle from 
the back of the fabric at the marking and 
pull the thread through to the knot.
1. Mark the 
desired position 
of the button on 
the wrong side of 
the item.
3. Run the needle up through one hole and 
down through another, then back into the fabric.
For four-hole buttons, make stitches 
through holes that are across from one 
another diagonally, not side by side.
NOTE
4. Insert a toothpick through the stitch, between 
the button and the fabric. Bring the needle back 
through the fabric and make a stitch through 
the other pair of holes (4-hole button) or the pre­
vious pair (2-hole button). Repeat the stitching 
process once more for each set of holes.
Toothpick
5. Tie 1 or 2 
knots on the 
wrong side of 
the item.
6. Remove the tooth­
pick. Bring the needle 
through the fabric and 
wind it around the 
stitches under the button to form a shank.
7. Reinsert the 
needle into the 
fabric and tie 
1 or 2 knots on 
the back.
TIP: Attaching Buttons by Machine
Flat buttons can also be sewn into place by 
machine using the appropriate foot, dropped 
feed dogs, and a tight zigzag stitch. Consult 
your sewing machine’s owner’s manual for 
specific information.

Attaching Shank Buttons
Shank buttons have a raised channel or loop on the back of 
the button.
1. See Steps 1 and 2 in Attaching Flat Buttons (page 70).
2. Run the needle through the shank 
and then back down through the 
fabric. Repeat the stitching process 
2 or 3 more times.
3. Tie 1 or 2 knots on the back side of the item.

Comforters cover the mattress but not the box spring. 
Coverlets cover the mattress and the box spring, and have 
additional length so that the pillow can be covered and a tuck 
made beneath it. Bedspreads are like coverlets but extend 
almost to the floor. Duvets cover a premade comforter.

Yardage Requirements
The chart below gives the total yardage needed for each 
type of bedding. Divide the yardage into the number of 
equal lengths shown in parentheses. Additional yardage 
may be needed to match large prints. For double-sided 
bedding, purchase a like amount of fabric for the backing.
Piece the lengths together vertically to achieve the needed 
minimum width. Determine the exact desired finished 
width and length based on the Bed and Bedding Sizes chart

Example:
A twin-size comforter or duvet will require 5 yards of 44˝-wide 
fabric for the top. Cut this fabric into 2 pieces, each 21/2 yards. 
Remove the selvages then join the 2 pieces along their long 
sides using a 1/2˝ seam allowance. The result will be a large 
piece measuring 87˝ × 21/2 yards. Trim to desired size.

Making Basic Standard- 
and Queen-Size Pillowcases
Throw Pillows
Prestuffed pillow forms make pillow-making easier and 
are available in a range of sizes and materials. For a tightly 
stuffed throw pillow, make a pillow cover that is an inch 
smaller than the form in each dimension when finished. For a 
softer pillow, make the finished cover the same size or slightly 
larger than the pillow form.
Pillows can also be made by first sewing a muslin cover 
and then filling it with stuffing (see Stuffing, page 38). For 
firm pillows, pack the stuffing tightly and evenly. For softer 
pillows, use less stuffing and fluff it while adding.
TIP
To give stuffed pillows a flatter, more even appearance, set the iron 
to a temperature that is appropriate for the outer fabric but hot 
enough to make steam. Press the pillow in sections.

Bed Skirts
Bed skirts are composed of a top covering that sits between 
the mattress and box spring, and a drop (either a ruffle or 
straight piece of fabric) that extends from the top of the box 
spring to the floor on the sides and foot of the bed. Ruffled 
bed skirts have a continuous ruffle that is joined to the sides 
and foot of the bed skirt. Pleated bed skirts have pleats at the 
corners and one or more pleats at the foot and sides.
Purchased bed skirts have a drop length that ranges from 
14˝ to 20˝. To determine the ideal drop length for your bed, 
measure from the top of the box spring to the floor. Add the 
seam and hem allowances to calculate the needed starting 
fabric strip width.
To calculate the finished (fully gathered or pleated) length of 
the bed skirt, multiply the side mattress dimension times 2, 
and add the foot mattress dimension. Multiply the finished 
length by the desired fullness (see Ruffle Fullness, page 44) 
to determine the starting length of the ruffle or pleat strip. 
Piece fabric to achieve the needed length.
The starting top covering fabric is cut the same size as the 
top of the box spring.

Curtain Width Measurements 
and Fullness Calculations
1. Measure from one end of the rod to the other. Do not include 
decorative elements such as finials.
2. Determine the desired fullness based on the type of fabric to 
be used and the look you want. Then calculate the ungathered 
width (see Ruffle Fullness, page 44).
Rod Length × Fullness Factor = Ungathered Width
For most fabrics, a curtain that is twice the width of the rod 
(twice the fullness) will give ideal fullness. For thin, sheer 
fabrics, three times the fullness will give more privacy, and 
for thick fabrics, one and a half times the fullness might be 
adequate. For curtains that split in the middle, use half the 
width of the rod for fullness calculations for each side.
Curtain Hanging Options
Rod pocket
A pocket to accommodate the rod, created by 
folding over the top edge of the fabric like a hem 
that is open at the sides (see Hems, page 29).
Hanging sleeve
A strip of fabric sewn to the back of the curtain for 
rod insertion (similar to a rod pocket).
Buttonholes
Sewn into the curtain for use with rings or ties that 
attach to the rod.
Grommets
Metal rings inserted into the curtain to create 
holes for the rod to weave in and out of.
Tab tops
Looped strips sewn to the curtain (see Basic 
Tab-Top Curtains, page 85) for rod insertion.
Clips
Clothespin-like metal hardware attached to the top 
edge of the curtain. The hardware includes a ring 
at the top that hangs from the rod.

Basic Tab-Top Curtains
1. Determine the desired finished 
dimensions, keeping in mind that the 
top edge of the panel will fall 3˝ below 
the rod. Add the allowances for side and 
bottom hems. Allow for a 1˝ double-fold 
hem at the top (2˝ hem allowance).
3. Determine how many 11/2˝ tabs will be needed for 
5˝ maximum spacing (on center) using the following 
calculations:
2. Cut the 
fabric and 
hem all sides.
Finished Panel Width ÷ (Maximum Spacing + 1)  
= Number of Spaces (round to the nearest whole number)
Number of Spaces + 1 = Number of Tabs
Number of Tabs × Tab Width = Total Tab Width
Finished Panel Width - Total Tab Width = Total Space Width
Total Space Width ÷ Number of Spaces = Space Width
For example, dividing 43˝ by 6 (maximum spacing + 1) 
gives 7.16, which rounds down to 7 spaces. Adding 1 to 7 
gives 8 tabs. Multiplying 8 × 11/2˝ = 12˝ (the total width 
of all the tabs placed side by side). Subtracting this 
number from 43˝ (the panel width) gives 31˝ (total space 
width). Dividing this number by 7 (the number of spaces) 
gives spacing of 4.4˝.

Round Tablecloths
Standard round tablecloth sizes are either 70˝ (for 44˝–60˝ 
tables) or 90˝ (for 60˝–78˝ tables) in diameter. To make a 
custom round tablecloth, measure the table across the center 
to determine the diameter. Determine the drop length.
Table Diameter + (Drop × 2) = Desired Finished Diameter
Add in the hem allowance for a narrow rolled hem (see Rolled 
Hem, page 29) or single-fold bias binding (page 45). Wide 
hems are not recommended.
Desired Finished Diameter + (Hem Allowance × 2) = Unhemmed Diameter
1. Prepiece fabric to provide enough width 
(see Panel Sizing and Assembly, page 88) to

Napkins
Sizing is a matter of personal preference, but napkins 
are usually square with a finished size between 
14˝ × 14˝ and 20˝ × 20˝. Determine the type of hem 
to be used and calculate the starting fabric size:
Table Runners and Place Mats
The standard place mat is a 14˝ × 18˝ rectangle, but size and 
shape may vary. A table runner can be shorter than the table 
or hang over at the ends. The width usually ranges from 16˝ 
to 24˝. The ends can have squared or rounded corners, or a 
geometric or curved shape.
Desired Finished Width + (Hem Allowance × 2) = Unhemmed Fabric Width
Desired Finished Length + (Hem Allowance × 2) = Unhemmed Fabric Length

TIP
A roll of gift wrap is a helpful 
tool for determining table runner 
and/or place mat size and shape. 
“Audition” different variations 
on your table before cutting 
and sewing fabric. For rounded 
corners and ends, use dishes as 
tracing templates.
2. Hem the edges as desired (see Hems, page 29). 
Mitered corners are an attractive, durable finish

Belts and Key Fobs
Belt Sizing
A belt should be at least 2˝ longer than the wearer’s waist 
measurement (see Size Charts, pages 116–122). More 
length can be added for decorative purposes (or expansion 
opportunities). Include a hardware attachment allowance 
(usually 3/4˝ to 1˝) in the length as well. Standard belt 
width is between 3/4˝ and 11/4˝, but width can range from 
skinny (less than 3/4˝) to wide (2˝–3˝). Key fobs are usually 
15˝ long × 1˝ wide, but the length can be varied for different 
hand sizes.
Belt Hardware
Bar buckle
Traditional belt buckle with a movable tang that fits through 
holes in the other end of the belt (usually grommet holes in 
fabric belts).

It usually includes a key ring that clips onto the clamp end.
Belt Materials
Webbing
A strong woven material that is commonly used for belts. 
It can be used alone or trimmed with ribbon or fabric. 
Synthetic webbing ends can be sealed by passing them 
through a flame. The ends of cotton webbings should be 
treated with a fray blocker or edge finished with a sewing 
machine.

Bag Fabrics
Most woven fabrics can be used for 
bag construction.
Canvas
Sturdy enough to be made into a bag 
without a lining or interfacing. It is 
also used as an interlining for thinner 
fabrics.
Oilcloth and laminated cotton
Sturdy as well as stain- and water-
resistant. These fabrics can be lined 
with self-fabrics or combined with 
lighter-weight fabrics.
Quilter’s cottons
Wide variety of colors and prints. 
Soft totes and slings can be made using one or two layers of 
this fabric, but heavyweight interfacing or fusible fleece is a

Interfacing
Bags are usually made from an outer fashion fabric and 
an inner lining. One or both fabrics may be fused to an 
interfacing (see Interfacing, page 34) to add structure and 
support. Another option is to add sew-in interfacing or 
additional fabric between the layers.
Straps
Either webbing or sewn fabric strips may be used 
for straps or handles (see Belt Materials,

Adding a Zipper
Zippers can be used for top and pocket closures. 
Patterns for zippered bags usually contain installation 
instructions that are specific to the shape and style 
of bag. An open-topped lined bag can be modified to 
include a zipper using the following technique:
1. Purchase a 
separating zipper 
that is 1/2˝ to 1˝ 
shorter than the 
finished bag opening.
2. Cut 2 strips of fabric that are 
1/2˝ longer than the zipper (stop 
to stop) and 21/2˝ wide.
3. Fold the strips in half 
lengthwise, right sides 
together. Stitch 1/4˝ from 
the raw edges, leaving a 1˝ 
opening in the center of the 
long edge.
4. For each strip, trim 
the seam allowance at the 
corners and turn right side 
out. Tuck the edges under at 
the opening and press.
5. Separate the zipper 
halves and lay them out 
with the working sides 
facing up.

Making Darts
Darts are pointed tucks that give shape to a fitted garment. 
1. Use a thick needle to pierce the pattern or template at 
the tip of the dart and the bottom of each dart leg.
2. Align the pattern or template 
with the wrong side of the fabric 
and use a fine washable marker 
or chalk pencil to mark the fabric 
through the holes.
3. Connect the dots.
TIP
Another option is to 
use tracing paper 
and a tracing wheel 
to transfer the dart 
lines to the fabric.
It is helpful to draw 
an additional line that 
vertically bisects the dart. 
For triangle-shaped darts, 
draw the line from the dart 
point to the edge of the 
fabric. For diamond-shaped 
darts, draw the line from 
point to point.

Adding Facings
Facings are used as a means of edge finishing and 
giving structure to openings in a garment. The inner 
facing edge is identical to that of the garment. The outer 
edge is shaped to fit the inside of the garment. Facings 
are generally fused to an interfacing before sewing. In 
order to reduce bulk in the seam allowances of thicker 
fabrics, you may choose not to extend the interfacing all 
the way to the edges. The outer facing edge is usually 
finished with a serger overlock stitch, zigzag stitch, or 
narrow hem before the facing is attached to the garment.
1. Place the facing 
against the outer 
garment, right sides 
together.
3. Turn the facing to the wrong side of the garment and 
work the edge to fully roll out the seams. Press the edge so 
the facing is not visible on the right side of the garment.

2. Stitch together 
using the specified 
seam allowance. Trim 
and/or snip curves.
4. Stitch through all the layers 
close to the inner or outer edge 
of the facing, or tack the edges 
of the facings at the seams to 
prevent shifting.
Tacking
Facings can be 
placed on the outside of 
the garment as a design 
detail. Fold under the 
seam allowance on the 
outside edge of the 
facing, and press. Stitch 
the right side of the facing 
to the wrong side of the 
garment. Turn the facing 
to the right side and 
edgestitch the pressed 
hem allowance into place.
NOTE

104
Linings
Linings give a clean edge finish and add an extra layer to 
the garment. This not only hides and protects the garment’s 
seams but also gives the extra opacity and drape that a slip 
would provide. In many cases, linings can be sewn from the 
same pattern pieces as the outer garment.
1. Construct the 
garment and 
lining separately, 
including darts 
and side seams.
3. Turn right side out through 
one of the unstitched areas. 
Complete the remaining seams. 
Hem the outer garment and lining 
separately to allow for movement.
2. Place the layers right sides together 
and sew at some (but not all) of the 
openings. In a sleeveless dress, for 
example, stitch the arm and neck 
openings but leave the back opening 
and bottom edges open.
TIP
Garments with facings 
can be modified to be 
lined, and vice versa.

Sewing Casings
Casings are channels that accommodate elastic. Most 
casings are made in a simliar fashion to hems (see 
Hems, page 29). The width of the casing should be 
about 1/8˝ greater than the width of the elastic.
1. Finish the 
raw edge with a 
narrow fold.
3. Using a safety pin or a tool called 
a bodkin, feed the elastic through 
the casing.
2. Fold the casing to the desired 
width and stitch, leaving an 
opening (usually at the center 
back) for 
elastic 
insertion.
4. Overlap or butt the 
elastic’s ends and then 
stitch securely.
5. Tuck the joined ends into 
the casing and stitch the 
opening closed. Spread the 
gathers evenly. Stitch back 
and forth over the casing 
at one or more seams to 
prevent twisting.
TIP
Single-fold bias tape (see Bias Tape, page 45) 
can be used to add a casing to a place on the 
garment that isn’t on a folded edge (such as 
the waist of a dress or the middle of a sleeve). 
Be sure the distance between the two rows 
of stitching used to attach the binding is 
¹⁄8˝ greater than the width of the elastic.

Sewing Set-In Sleeves
Adding sleeves to a garment utilizes the principles of curved 
piecing (see Curved Seams, page 24). The top of the sleeve 
(called the cap) is larger than the segment of the armhole to 
which it is attached. This is called cap ease, and it allows the 
sleeve to move and hang properly. To accommodate the cap ease, 
the pieces should be aligned and pinned at regular intervals.
Flat Sleeve Attachment
This technique allows for more working room and easier sewing.
Sew the front and back bodice pieces together at the 
shoulder seams. Leave the side seams of the bodice open.
NOTE
1. With right sides together, 
match the center of the 
sleeve with the center of the 
armhole, and pin.
2. Match the corner 
of the sleeve with the 
corresponding end of 
the armhole, and pin.
3. Align and pin the edges 
in between.
4. Repeat on the other side 
of the center point.
5. Stitch the arm­
hole seam and 
edge finish as 
desired.
6. Bring the front and back bodice 
pieces together. Align the sleeve and 
bodice side seam edges. Stitch and 
edge finish as desired.

Tubular Sleeve Attachment
In this more advanced technique, the side seams are 
completed before attaching the sleeve.
1. Stitch and edge finish the 
sleeve underarm seams, the 
bodice side seams, and the 
bodice shoulder seams.
2. Turn the sleeve so the right side is facing 
out. Place the sleeve inside the bodice, right 
sides facing each other. Match the bodice 
side seam to the sleeve underarm seam, and 
pin. Match the bodice shoulder seam to the 
sleeve shoulder point, and pin.

4. Stitch the armhole seam 
and edge finish as desired.
5. Pull the sleeve out and

Patterns
Selecting Patterns
Not long ago, shopping for patterns involved flipping through 
large pattern catalogs in fabric stores. Now, the Internet has 
made pattern shopping more efficient and informative.
Major pattern companies such as Vogue, McCall’s, Butterick, 
and New Look provide catalogs online and offer search 
features that allow for quick selection by specific style. The 
patterns can then be purchased from a store or ordered 
from the website. Many patterns are available as electronic 
downloads that are printed at home on 81/2˝ × 11˝ paper and 
assembled into full-sized patterns. Independent pattern­
makers are gaining market share thanks to favorable reviews 
on social networking sites and blogs. Websites such as 
patternreview.com, burdastyle.com, craftsy.com, and others 
have created communities for sewists of all levels to share 
their experiences with both independent and commercial 
patterns.
Consider the following factors when selecting a pattern.
Material Requirements
Be sure that the item can be made from a fabric that you are 
comfortable sewing, laundering or dry-cleaning, and wearing. 
Also keep yardage requirements and cost in mind.
Sizing
Depending on the company, 
pattern sizes may vary 
greatly from off-the-rack 
sizes. Patterns often include 
multiple sizes rather than a 
single size. Be sure to select 
the appropriate size (see 
Verifying Sizing, page 109) 
and select the package that 
includes your size. Internet 
reviews are a good way to 
find out if a pattern runs true 
to size.
Difficulty Level
Patterns may be labeled with 
a needed skill level. Unless 
they are marked as easy or 
for beginners, many patterns 
assume an intermediate 
level of experience. Those 
with clear and detailed 
instructions give beginners 
a better chance for success. 
Again, Internet reviews can 
give insight into both the 
skills needed and the quality 
of the instructions.

Garment Making
109
Garment 
making
Verifying Sizing
Pattern companies usually provide size charts in pattern 
books, online, and within the patterns themselves. 
Compare your measurements to the chart and select the 
size that is closest to your own. If one measurement falls 
into a different size bracket, you may need to modify the 
pattern (see Adjusting for Height, page 113, and Adjusting 
for Girth, page 115). Patterns often provide finished 
garment measurements. If they do not, it is a good idea 
to calculate the finished measurements at specific points 
(such as the bustline and hips). (See Calculating Pattern 
Finished Measurements, page 112.) Compare the garment 
measurements to those of a nice-fitting garment that you 
already own. Or you can subtract your body measurements 
from the garment measurements to determine how much ease 
is included in the pattern. This will help you predict the fit of 
the garment (see Ease, page 112).

Pattern Abbreviations and Markings
Pattern pieces often have placement and stitching information 
printed on them. Because of space constraints, the following 
abbreviations are sometimes used:
RS (right side), RST (right sides together), RSO (right sides out)
WS (wrong side), WST (wrong sides together), WSO (wrong sides out)
SA (seam allowance), CF (center front), CB (center back)
 Notch
Indicates a matching point for 
accurately joining two pieces. May 
be cut into the seam allowance or 
extended beyond the raw edge.
 Dot
Indicates a stitching stop, 
matching point, or placement 
point for objects such as buttons.

Essential Sewing Reference Tool
110
Buttonhole placement
Indicates position of 
buttonholes and buttons. 
Placement is usually 
represented by a straight line 
or “I”-shaped mark. An X 
represents the button position.
Placement lines
Indicate position for 
pockets or decora­
tive elements.
The outer edges of the pattern are usually cutting lines, 
unless the seam allowance is not included (common in 
European patterns). In multisized nested pattern sets, 
the cutting lines may have different thicknesses, dashing 
patterns, or colors for different sizes. Other lines (for 
example, stitching, hem position, or pocket placement) 
are usually defined by text on the pattern.
Cutting layouts show the ideal 
placement of pattern pieces on 
the fabric. If the cutting layout 
is not followed, a fabric shortage 
may occur. Folds are sometimes 
represented by dashed lines. Pieces 
placed on the fold line will be 
doubled. Pieces placed on folded 
fabric (but set apart) will be mirror 
images of one another. Selvages are 
marked to indicate the orientation of 
the fabric.
Body Measurements
Obtaining accurate measurements is the first step in 
constructing a great-fitting garment. For most articles of 
clothing, the pattern size is chosen based on one or more of 
only three horizontal body measurements: bust/chest, waist, 
and hips. For the best results, take measurements over the 
undergarments that will be worn with the finished garment.
Double-pointed arrow
 Indicates how 
the pattern piece should be

Bust/Chest
Measure around the breasts or 
chest at the fullest point.
Waist
Measure at the narrowest point. 
You can find this point by bending 
over to the side and locating the 
crease that forms at the side.
Hips
Measure around the hips at the fullest point.
Compare the measurements to those in the size chart that 
goes with the pattern. Depending on the wearer’s proportions, 
all parts of the body may not fall into the same size category. 
Base your pattern selection on the measurements that 
are most relevant to the garment you are making. Also 
note whether or not parts of the garment have a free fit. 
For example, pajama pants usually have a stretch elastic 
waistband, so the hip measurement is most important. 
For a fitted garment such as a sheath dress, all three 
measurements are important. A general rule of thumb is to 
choose the size dictated by the largest measurement. Alter 
the remaining parts of the pattern (see Adjusting for Girth, 
page 115) or take in the garment during the sewing process.
Vertical measurements are helpful for deciding how long 
to make different parts of the garment and whether or not 
a pattern should be modified for the wearer’s height (see 
Adjusting for Height, page 113).

Over the years, retail sizing 
has deviated from the original 
garment standards for women’s 
clothing. Your store-bought size may 
be vastly different from your pattern 
size. For example, a woman with 
38˝ hips would wear a size 6 off the 
rack but would need a size 12 pattern 
to make a properly fitting garment. 
Some companies have developed 
pattern lines that are more consistent 
with current retail sizing, but it is 
always best to base your pattern 
selection on measurements rather 
than a specific size.
NOTE

Ease
Ease is the difference between the garment measurements 
and the body measurements. If a garment were made with 
no ease, it would be skintight. Wearing ease is the absolute 
minimum amount of ease needed for movement and comfort. 
Different parts of the body require different amounts of ease. 
Design ease is anything beyond wearing ease that gives the 
garment a specific fit or style. For example, a dress that is 
semifitted in the bust and very loose-fitting in the hips would 
be an A-line style.

Calculating Pattern Finished 
Measurements
Measure the pattern pieces at the desired line—generally 
bustline, waistline, or hipline. Add the front and back 
measurements (remember to double the measurement if 
the piece is placed on a fold) and then subtract the seam 
allowances. For patterns with darts, exclude the darts from 
your measurements. This will give you the finished measure­
ment at the selected line.
The ranges for wearing ease apply to garments made from 
woven fabrics. Since knit fabrics stretch, knit garments can be made 
with very little (or even negative) ease and still fit comfortably.

A wearer’s preferred ease may be determined by 
measuring great-fitting garments that he or she already 
owns. Just measure at the appropriate points as described 
for the patterns (no need to subtract hems or darts).
NOTE
Adjusting for Height
Most patterns are designed to fit a specific height range. For 
women, this is 5´5˝–5´6˝; for men, 5´10˝; and for children, 
the average height for the given age or size (see Size Charts, 
pages 116–122). For misses’ and women’s sizes, some patterns 
are available for petites, but not for tall women. For children 
and men, there are no separate patterns for slims, huskies, 
talls, or shorts. Within a pattern set there is some vertical 
variation for the different sizes—the smaller sizes are slightly 
shorter, and the larger sizes are slightly longer. For the most 
part, however, adjustments for height must be made by the 
sewist.
For most free-fitting garments, adjusting the pattern for 
height is simply a matter of adding or subtracting length 
at the bottom edge. For more fitted garments, especially 
pants and dresses, modifications to accommodate different 
proportions must be made at one or more points between the 
top edge and the bottom edge of the pattern. Many patterns 
include double lines that are labeled “lengthen or shorten 
here.” For tops, this marking is usually between the bustline 
and the waistline. For pants and skirts, it may be between 
the waist and the crotch, between the crotch and the knee, or 
both. If lines are not shown, you can add them.
You must make height adjustments on the pattern, 
prior to cutting the fabric.

To shorten a pattern: Cut at the double lines. Overlap the 
pattern pieces the necessary amount and tape together. 
Blend the dart and side lines to reconnect them.
To lengthen a pattern: Cut at the double lines. Place the 
pattern pieces on a separate sheet of paper, the necessary 
distance apart, and tape together. Reconnect the dart and 
side lines. Cut the paper flush with the pattern edges.
Vertical-measurement 
charts are very useful for 
determining if and where 
adjustments should be made. 
For example, say a knee-
length dress is designed for a 
woman with a height of 5´6˝, 
but the wearer is 5´10˝. The 
vertical-length charts show 
that the shoulder-to-knee 
measurement is 383/4˝ for 
5´6˝ and 411/2˝ for 5´10˝—a 
23/4˝ difference.
In addition, the shoulder-
to-waist measurements 
for the pattern and wearer 
differ by 1˝, and the waist-
to-knee measurements 
differ by 13/4˝. To give even 
more detail, the waist-to-
crotch measurements differ 
by 11/4˝, and the crotch-to-
knee measurements by 
1/2˝. In order to fit a 5´10˝ 
woman, the pattern should 
be lengthened 1˝ between 
the shoulder and waist, 
11/4˝ between the waist and 
crotch, and 1/2˝ between the 
crotch and knee.

Adjusting for Girth
Patterns are usually designed to fit a standard set of 
proportions. Most misses’ size patterns are designed 
for a relatively balanced hipline and bustline and a 
significantly smaller waist. For women’s sizes, the bustline 
and waistline are about the same, and the hipline is larger.
Actual figures vary widely in proportions. The good news is 
that most patterns can be adjusted to fit almost any figure 
type. Cutting lines can be moved out to make a portion of 
the garment larger, or moved in to make it smaller. Openings 
such as necklines and armholes can be increased or 
decreased as well. When adjusting patterns, it is a good idea 
to make a test garment out of inexpensive fabric so that the 
fit can be fine-tuned.
The waistline is one of the easiest parts of a pattern to adjust. 
It can be increased by moving the side seams out and/or 
decreasing the dart width (a). It can be taken in by moving 
the side seams in and/or increasing the dart width (b).
Patterns can also be merged 
to get the best possible fit. 
For example, if the wearer 
measures a size 8 in the bust 
and a size 10 in the hips, 
the top part of a fitted dress 
pattern could be traced from 
the size 8 and the bottom 
from a size 10, and the lines 
blended at the waistline.

Note: Children can be difficult to measure. In babies, the chest, 
waist, and hip run about the same, so the chest is the only measuring 
point needed. For toddlers, the hip measurement should be taken 
over diapers, if applicable.
lf the child is between sizes, always choose the larger size to 
accommodate rapid growth.

Note: Children’s sizing is based on averages for different ages, but 
measurements are much more important than age for determining size. 
Like adults, children vary in height and proportion. Average heights are 
provided with the measurements above. Tall, thin children may have 
measurements that indicate a very small pattern size. In this case it is 
usually better to choose the size indicated by the height measurement so 
that the proportions are correct.

For heights outside the chart range, consult the adult size charts.
Girls’ and boys’ 
sizing deviates starting at 
size 7 as girls develop a 
smaller waist-to-hip ratio.
There is some overlap 
between teen and misses’ 
sizing in hip size, but misses’ 
sizes are associated with 
smaller waist and larger 
bust measurements.

About the Author
CARLA HEGEMAN CRIM, founder of Scientific Seamstress 
LLC, is a molecular biologist turned patternmaker. She has 
a B.S. in biology from Virginia Commonwealth University 
and a Ph.D. in plant physiology from Virginia Tech and was 
a postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University. She is a self-
taught seamstress who has been experimenting with fabric 
for more than 30 years. The Scientific Seamstress blog and 
pattern series are well known for their complete, easy-to-
follow instructions and detailed illustrations. When her son 
came along, she decided to stay home with him and build a 
business out of sewing. For the first few years, she focused 
on elaborate clothing designs for dolls and children. She 
had many requests for her patterns and began publishing 
them in 2006. Carla also collaborates with popular fabric 
designer Jennifer Paganelli on a series of Sis Boom patterns 
for children and adults. Her first book, Sewn Hats, was 
published in 2013. When she isn’t in her sewing lab, Carla 
enjoys gardening, yoga, and spending time with her family.

Stitches  
and  
Seams
Couture Seam Finishes
Flat-Felled Seam
French Seam
1. Start with clean, freshly cut edges with no fraying.
2. With the wrong sides together,  
stitch 1/8˝ from the aligned edges (A).
3. Turn so that the right sides are facing  
each other. Press the seam with the  
stitching on the fold (B).
4. Stitch 3/8˝ from the folded edge (C).
5. Press the seam to the side.
D
E
1. Stitch with a 1/2˝–5/8˝ seam 
allowance, right sides together. 
Press open (A).
2. Fold back the fabric on one 
side. Trim a side of the seam 
allowance to half of the orig-
inal width (B).
3. Fold the wider allowance 
over the narrower allowance 
so that the raw edge is in 
line with the original seam 
stitching (C).
4. Open the fabrics and press 
the encased seam allowance 
to the side (D).
5. Stitch into place, very close 
to the folded edge (E).
A
B
This seam can be started with the wrong sides of the fabric 
together, so that the fold ends up on the right side, adding detail to 
the garment.
NOTE
The resulting seam allowance is approximately 5⁄8˝, so be 
sure to take this into account when cutting the fabric.
