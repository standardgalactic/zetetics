Can ChatGPT Truly Overcome Other Large
Language Models?
Partha Pratim Ray1
Dear Editor,
I recently had the opportunity to delve into the research
paper.1 The study offers a comprehensive analysis of the
capabilities of two leading AI chatbots, ChatGPT and Bard, in
the context of radiology knowledge assessment. While the
research is commendable for its depth and methodology, I
would like to highlight a few areas of potential improvement
and discuss the broader implications of such studies in the
future of radiology.2,3
I ﬁnd a number of lacunae: (a) Diversity of Questions: While
the study sourced questions from the American College of
Radiology’s Diagnostic Radiology In-Training (DXIT) exam-
ination, it would be beneﬁcial to see how these chatbots perform
with questions from other international radiology examinations
or real-world clinical scenarios. This would provide a more
holistic understanding of their capabilities; (b) Explanation
Analysis: The study rightly points out instances where the
chatbots, despite providing the correct answer, failed to address
the educational content of the question adequately. A deeper
dive into the reasons behind these discrepancies could offer
insights into improving AI chatbot training and (c) User Ex-
perience: While the study focuses on accuracy, response length,
and response time, it might also be beneﬁcial to consider the
user experience. How do radiologists and trainees perceive the
utility of these chatbots in their daily practice or learning?
I also provide few future directions about moving forward
in radiology-based large language model (LLM) integration.
Firstly, a need of multimodal input. The current study focuses
on text-based questions. However, radiology is inherently
visual. Future research could explore the capabilities of these
chatbots when provided with both textual and visual (eg,
X-rays, MRIs) inputs.4,5 Secondly, inclinations towards a
continuous learning. As AI models evolve, it would be in-
teresting to see if continuous learning mechanisms can be
implemented, allowing these chatbots to learn from their
mistakes and improve over time. Thirdly, the need of effective
integration into clinical practices. Beyond examinations, the
potential integration of such chatbots into clinical practice
could revolutionize patient care. Lastly, strong consideration
of ethical considerations. As AI becomes more integrated into
medical ﬁelds like radiology, there will be a need for
discussions around the ethical implications of AI-assisted
diagnoses and the potential for errors. Overall, the study
concludes that ChatGPT outperforms Google Bard in their
comparison study in terms of radiology knowledge and related
tasks, more work is needed in other spheres of knowledge to
come to the right conclusion.
