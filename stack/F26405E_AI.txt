SERIOUS HEAD INJURY HAZARD
Installation over concrete, asphalt, dirt, grass, carpet 
and other hard surface creates a risk of serious injury 
or death from falls to the ground. Install and maintain 
shock absorbing material under and around play-set as 
recommended on page 3 of these instructions.
COLLISION HAZARD
Place play-set on level ground at least 2m from any 
obstruction such as a garage or house, fences, poles, 
trees, sidewalks, walls, landscape timbers, rocks, 
pavement, planters, garden borders, overhanging 
branches, laundry lines, and electrical wires. (See 
OBSTACLE FREE SAFETY ZONE on cover)

Failure to prohibit these items, even helmets with chin 
straps, increases the risk of serious injury and death to 
children from entanglement and strangulation.
TIP OVER HAZARD
Choose a level location for the equipment. This can reduce 
the likelihood of the play set tipping over and loose-ﬁll 
surfacing materials washing away during heavy rains.
DO NOT allow children to play on the play-set until the 
assembly is complete and the unit is properly anchored.

One of the most important things you can do to reduce the likelihood of serious head injuries is to install shock-absorbing 
protective surfacing under and around your play equipment. The protective surfacing should be applied to a depth that is suitable 
for the equipment height in accordance with ASTM F1292. There are different types of surfacing to choose from; whichever 
product you select, follow these guidelines:
Loose-Fill Materials
•  Maintain a minimum depth of 9 inches of loose-fill materials such as wood mulch/chips, engineered wood fiber (EWF), or
shredded/recycled rubber mulch for equipment up to 8 feet high; and 9 inches of sand or pea gravel for equipment up to 5 feet
high. NOTE: An initial fill level of 12 inches will compress to about a 9-inch depth of surfacing over time. The surfacing will also
compact, displace, and settle, and should be periodically raked and refilled to maintain at least a 9-inch depth.
•  Use a minimum of 6 inches of protective surfacing for play equipment less than 4 feet in height. If maintained properly, this
should be adequate. (At depths less than 6 inches, the protective material is too easily displaced or compacted.)
NOTE: Do not install home playground equipment over concrete, asphalt, or any other hard surface. A fall onto a hard surface 
can result in serious injury to the equipment user. Grass and dirt are not considered protective surfacing because wear and 
environmental factors can reduce their shock absorbing effectiveness. Carpeting and thin mats are not adequate protective 
surfacing. Ground level equipment -- such as a sandbox, activity wall, playhouse or other equipment that has no elevated play 
surface -- does not need any protective surfacing.
•  Use containment, such as digging out around the perimeter and/or lining the perimeter with landscape edging. Don’t forget to
account for water drainage.
•  Periodically rake, check and maintain the depth of the loose-fill surfacing material. Marking the correct depth on the play
equipment support posts will help you to see when the material has settled and needs to be raked and or replenished. Be sure to
rake and evenly redistribute the surfacing in heavily used areas.
•  Do not install loose fill surfacing over hard surfaces such as concrete or asphalt.
Poured-In-Place Surfaces or Pre-Manufactured Rubber Tiles
You may be interested in using surfacing other than loose-fill materials - like rubber tiles or poured-in-place surfaces.
•  Installations of these surfaces generally require a professional and are not “do-it yourself ” projects.
•  Review surface specifications before purchasing this type of surfacing. Ask the installer/manufacturer for a report showing that
the product has been tested to the following safety standard: ASTM F1292 Standard Specification for Impact Attenuation of  Surfacing
Materials within the Use Zone of  Playground Equipment. This report should show the specific height for which the surface is intended
to protect against serious head injury. This height should be equal to or greater than the fall height - vertical distance between a
designated play surface (elevated surface for standing, sitting, or climbing) and the protective surfacing below - of your play equipment.
•  Check the protective surfacing frequently for wear.
Placement
Proper placement and maintenance of protective surfacing is essential. Refer to diagram on front cover. Be sure to;
•  Extend surfacing at least 2m from the equipment in all directions.
•  For to-fro swings, extend protective surfacing in front of and behind the swing to a distance equal to twice the height of the top bar 
from which the swing is suspended.
•  For tire swings, extend surfacing in a circle whose radius is equal to the height of the suspending chain or rope, plus 6 feet in all 
directions.

HARDWARE:
  Check metal parts for rust. If found, 
sand and repaint using a non-lead paint 
complying with 16 CFR 1303.
  Inspect and tighten all hardware. On 
wood assemblies DO NOT OVER-
TIGHTEN as to cause crushing and 
splintering of wood.
  Check for sharp edges or protruding screw threads, add 
washers if required.
SHOCK ABSORBING SURFACING:
  Check for foreign objects. Rake and check depth of loose 
fill protective surfacing materials to prevent compaction and 
maintain appropriate depth. Replace as necessary. 
(See Protective Surfacing, page 3)
GROUND STAKES (ANCHORS):
  Check for looseness, damage or deterioration. Should firmly 
anchor unit to ground during use. Re-secure and or replace, 
if necessary.
SWING HANGERS:
  Check that they are secure and orientated correctly. Hook 
should rotate freely and perpendicular to support beam.
  If squeaking occurs lubricate bushings with oil or WD-40®.
SWINGS, ROPES AND RIDES:
  Reinstall if removed during cold season. Check all moving 
parts including swing seats, ropes, chains and attachments 
for wear, rust and other deterioration. Replace as needed.
  Check that ropes are tight, secure at both ends and cannot 
loop back as to create an entrapment.
WOOD PARTS:
  Check all wood members for deterioration, structural 
damage and splintering. Sand down splinters and replace 
deteriorated wood members. As with all wood, some 
checking and small cracks in grain is normal.
  Applying a water repellent or stain (water-based) on a yearly 
basis is important maintenance to maintain maximum life 
and performance of the product
Instructions for Proper Maintenance
Your KidKraft Play System is designed and constructed of quality materials with your child’s safety in mind. As with all 
outdoor products used by children, it will weather and wear. To maximize the enjoyment, safety and life of your Play Set, 
it is important that you, the owner, properly maintain it.
Check the following at the beginning of the play season:
HARDWARE:
  Inspect for tightness. Must be firmly against, but not 
crushing the wood. DO NOT OVER-TIGHTEN. 
This will cause splintering of wood.
  Check for sharp edges or protruding screw threads.
Add washers if required.
SHOCK ABSORBING SURFACING:
  Rake and check depth of loose fill protective surfacing 
materials to prevent compaction and maintain appropriate 
depth. Replace as necessary. 
(See Protective Surfacing, page 3)
Check twice a month during play season:
SWING HANGERS:
  Check that they are secure and orientated correctly. Hook 
should rotate freely and perpendicular to support beam.
  If squeaking occurs lubricate bushings with oil or WD-40®.
SWINGS AND RIDES:
  Check swing seats, all ropes, chains and attachments for 
fraying, wear, excessive corrosion or damage. 
Replace if structurally damaged or deteriorated.
Check once a month during play season:
SWINGS AND RIDES:
  To prolong their life, remove swings and store inside when 
outside temperature is below 32°F/0°C. Below freezing, 
plastic parts may become more brittle.
SHOCK ABSORBING SURFACING:
  Rake and check depth of loose fill protective surfacing 
materials to prevent compaction and maintain appropriate 
depth. Replace as necessary.
(See Protective Surfacing, page 3)
Check at the end of the play season:
If you dispose of your play set: Please disassemble and dispose of your unit so that it does not create any unreasonable 
hazards at the time it is discarded. Be sure to follow your local waste ordinances.

About Our Wood
KidKraft uses only premium playset lumber, ensuring the safest product for your children’s use. Although great care has been taken in 
selecting the best quality lumber available, wood is a product of nature and susceptible to weathering (changes in the aesthetics of the wood). 
A light sanding may be required to remove minor splinters. For your information, we have described some changes that may occur as a 
result of weathering:
1. Checking  Checks are surface cracks in the wood along the grain. 4” x 4” material will experience more checking than 2”, 1-1/4” or 1”
material be cause the surface and interior moisture content will vary more widely than in thinner wood.
2. Warping Warping refers to any distortion (twisting, cupping) from the true plane that may take place during weathering.
3. Fading
Wood exposed to sunlight, will over time, turn a grey color.
Note: The above changes will not affect the strength of the product.
What causes weathering?
One of the main reasons for weathering is the effects of water (moisture); the moisture content of the wood at the surface is different than the 
interior of the wood. As the moisture moves in or out of the wood (result of climate changes), the different moisture content causes tension 
in the wood, which can result in checking and or warping.
How can I reduce the amount of weathering to my Play System?
At the factory we have added water repellent to the stain. This water repellent decreases the amount of water absorption during rain or snow 
thus decreasing the tension in the wood. Sunlight will break down the water repellent, applying a water repellent or stain on a yearly basis is 
important maintenance. (see your local stain and paint supplier for a recommended product)  Also if storing the product before installation, 
make sure you store out of direct sunlight in a cool dry place.
Will weathering affect the strength of my Play System?
Most weathering is just the normal result of nature and will not affect safe play and enjoyment for your child. However if you are concerned 
that a part has experienced a severe weathering problem please call our consumer relations department for further assistance.

Keys to Assembly Success
Part Identification Key
On each page, you will find the parts and 
quantities required to complete the assembly 
step illustrated on that page. Here is a sample.
Symbols
Throughout these instructions symbols are provided as important reminders for proper and safe assembly.
Proper Hardware Assembly
Lag screws require drilling pilot 
holes to avoid splitting wood. Only 
a flat washer is required. For ease of 
installation liquid soap can be used  
on all lag-type screws.
For bolts, tap T-Nut into hole with 
hammer. Insert the hex bolt through 
lock washer first then flat washer then 
hole. Because the assemblies need to 
be squared do not completely tighten 
until instructed. Pay close attention to 
diameter of the bolts. 5/16” is slightly 
larger than 1/4”.
Once the assembly is tightened, watch for exposed 
threads. If a thread protrudes from the T-Nut, remove the 
bolt and add washers to eliminate this condition. Extra 
washers have been provided for this purpose.
This identifies information that requires special 
attention. Improper assembly could lead to an 
unsafe or dangerous condition.
Where this is shown, 2 or 3 
people are required to safely 
complete the step. To avoid 
injury or damage to the 
assembly make sure to get help!
Check that assembly is square  
before tightening bolts.
Use a measuring tape to assure  
proper location.
Check that set or assembly is properly level  
before proceeding.
Pre-drill a pilot hole before  
fastening screw or lag to prevent  
splitting of wood.
This indicates time to tighten bolts, but  
not too tight! Do not crush the wood.  
This may create splinters and cause  
structural damage.

Step 2: Rock Wall Assembly
A:  Lay 2 (0349) Rock Rails down, side by side with angled edges facing down. (fig. 2.1)
B:  Place (1779) CE Access Board on the bottom of each (0349) Rock Rail as shown in fig. 2.1.  Make sure (1779) 
CE Access Board is flush to the outside and bottom edges of each (0349).  Attach using 4 (S2) #8 x 1-1/2” Wood 
Screws.
C: 7-3/4” down from the top of both (0349) Rock Rails place 1 (1777) CE Rock Board B, making sure the sides are 
flush to the outside edges of each (0349) Rock Rail.  Attach using 4 (S2) #8 x 1-1/2” Wood Screws. (fig. 2.1)
D:  In between the (1779) CE Access Board and (1777) CE Rock Board B stagger 2 (1777) and 2 (1778) CE 
Rock Boards A and B using 4 (S2) #8 x 1-1/2” Wood Screws per board.  Placing them as shown in fig. 2.1, this 
will prevent rocks from forming a straight line.  Make sure the boards are evenly spaced and do not exceed 2-3/8” 
between boards.
E:  Place 1 rock on each (1777) and (1778) CE Rock Board 
A and B (fig. 2.2) and attach using 1 (PB2) 1/4 x 1-1/4” Pan 
Bolt (with lock washer, flat washer and barrel nut) and 1 (S10) 
#8 x 1” Pan Screw per rock.  The Screw must be in the hole 
directly under the Pan Bolt, it will stop the rock from spinning. 
(fig. 2.3)
Note: Gaps between boards 2-1/4”, 
not to exceed 2-3/8”
Note:  The holes 
in the rock boards 
must orient to the 
top of the boards.

Step 3:  Swing Beam Assembly
Make sure triangle is 
tight against beam
Warning:  For your child’s safety, 
orientate the swing hangers as 
shown to ensure your swing will 
have proper swing motion when 
installed.  Failure to do so could 
result in premature failure of the 
swing hanger or swing chain.  
A:  In the middle holes of (1249) 
Back Beam install 2 Bolt-Thru Swing 
Hangers (fig. 3.1) making sure the 
swing hangers are oriented in the 
direction shown in fig. 3.4 to maintain 
proper swing motion.
B:  In the end holes of (1248) Front Beam install 2 
Bolt-Thru Swing Hangers (fig. 3.1) making sure the 
swing hangers are oriented in the direction shown in 
fig. 3.4 to maintain proper swing motion.
