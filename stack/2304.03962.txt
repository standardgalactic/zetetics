Abstract
We take the point of view that building a one-way bridge from experimental data to mathematical models instead
of the other way around avoids running into controversies resulting from attaching meaning to the symbols used
in the latter. In particular, we show that adopting this view offers new perspectives for constructing mathematical
models for and interpreting the results of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments. We ﬁrst prove new Bell-type
inequalities constraining the values of the four correlations obtained by performing Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm
experiments under four different conditions. The proof is “model-free” in the sense that it does not refer to any
mathematical model that one imagines to have produced the data. The constraints only depend on the number of
quadruples obtained by reshufﬂing the data in the four data sets without changing the values of the correlations. These
new inequalities reduce to model-free versions of the well-known Bell-type inequalities if the maximum fraction of
quadruples is equal to one. Being model-free, a violation of the latter by experimental data implies that not all the
data in the four data sets can be reshufﬂed to form quadruples. Furthermore, being model-free inequalities, a violation
of the latter by experimental data only implies that any mathematical model assumed to produce this data does not
apply. Starting from the data obtained by performing Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments, we construct
instead of postulate mathematical models that describe the main features of these data. The mathematical framework
of plausible reasoning is applied to reproducible and robust data, yielding without using any concept of quantum
theory, the expression of the correlation for a system of two spin-1/2 objects in the singlet state. Next, we apply Bell’s
theorem to the Stern-Gerlach experiment and demonstrate how the requirement of separability leads to the quantum-
theoretical description of the averages and correlations obtained from an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiment.
We analyze the data of an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiment and debunk the popular statement that Einstein-
Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments have vindicated quantum theory. We argue that it is not quantum theory but
the processing of data from EPRB experiments that should be questioned. We perform Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-
Bohm experiments on a superconducting quantum information processor to show that the event-by-event generation
of discrete data can yield results that are in good agreement with the quantum-theoretical description of the Einstein-
Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm thought experiment. We demonstrate that a stochastic and a subquantum model can also
produce data that are in excellent agreement with the quantum-theoretical description of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-
Bohm thought experiment.

1. Introduction
All experiments which yield results in numerical form generate a ﬁnite amount of discrete data represented by
(ratios of) ﬁnite integers. Obviously, also algorithms running on digital computers generate discrete data (a ﬁnite
number of bits). The same can be said of analog simulations by means of e.g., electronic circuits. In practice, the data
gathered from these experiments also comes in the form of a ﬁnite amount of sampled, discrete data, even though we
often imagine them as continuous.
In this paper, discrete data are considered to be immutable facts, free of personal judgment. Of course, there ﬁrst
has to be a consensus among individuals that the discrete data are indeed immutable facts. Once this consensus has
been established these immutable facts constitute the “reality”, the “real world” that we refer to in this paper. By
adopting this very narrow deﬁnition of “reality”, there is little room left for philosophical arguments about the nature
of reality, realism etc. [1]. In brief, experimental or computer generated data are considered as immutable facts,
constituting the “reality”. At the risk of overemphasizing the importance of taking this narrow view of “reality”, it
is necessary to carefully distinguish the deﬁnition of reality as immutable facts adopted in this paper for the aim of
analyzing speciﬁc scientiﬁc questions from the question “what is reality really?”, which goes far beyond the scope
of this paper.
We take the common view that a mathematical model (MM), that is a model formulated in the language of math-
ematics, of (the process that generates) the data should provide a description of the discrete data that is more concise
than simply tabulating all the data. The MM should describe the data or the relevant features thereof, either in terms

of discrete data itself or, as is more common in physics, by providing a function of one or more variables that ﬁts well
to the data. If possible, a MM should also describe relations between features extracted from the data.
We distinguish between two classes of MMs. The ﬁrst class (M1C) contains all MMs which generate discrete
data in a ﬁnite number of steps. MMs of this class can be represented by a terminating algorithm running on a digital
computer. Any such algorithm is an instance of a computer model (CM), the acronym that will be used to refer to the
ﬁrst class of MMs. On the other hand, as digital computers are physical devices on which numerical experiments are
being carried out, CMs can also be viewed as metaphors for real experiments in which all conditions are known and
under control (assuming the digital computer is operating ﬂawlessly which, in practice, is easily veriﬁed by repeating
the numerical experiment) [2]. Furthermore, the logical operation of the electronic digital computers we are all used
to can equally well be realized by a mechanical machine, albeit at great cost and great loss of efﬁciency. Thus, any
CM executed on a digital computer has, at least in principle, a macroscopic, mechanical equivalent. The second class
(M2C), symbolically represented in Fig. 1 by the green rectangle with rounded edges contains all MMs that do not
belong to M1C.
Most of the fundamental models in theoretical physics are based on the notions of the space-time continuum and
real numbers. After suitable discretization, the equations of classical physics for Newtonian mechanics, Maxwell’s
electrodynamics, special relativity, etc., produce discrete data when these equations are solved numerically on a digital
computer. Although the discretization procedure is not unique, different procedures all share the property that they
yield the same continuum model. Thus, as indicated in Fig. 1, the relation between the MM and CM is bidirectional.
The transition from any probabilistic or quantum-theoretical model to discrete data requires the use of an algorithm
that is external to both these models. This transition is unidirectional. Conceptually, these models are separated
from the discrete data by a gap that takes the proportion of an abyss. A probabilistic model is deﬁned by its real-
valued probability (density) measure on a probability space [3, 4]. It describes the probability (density) distribution of
events [3, 4]. Probability theory does not contain a recipe/algorithm to generate the events. Adding such an algorithm,
which to make contact to the realm of discrete data is necessarily ﬁnite and terminating (e.g., a pseudo-random
number generator), fundamentally changes the mathematical structure of the probabilistic model, turning it into an
event-by-event simulation on a digital computer, a CM.
In quantum theory, the state of the system is described by a vector (or density matrix) in an abstract Hilbert
space [5, 6]. Quantum theory plus any of the interpretations allegedly explaining the existence of the discrete, deﬁnite
4

events encountered in real life faces the same abyss. Also, this M2C does not contain a recipe/algorithm to generate
the events but, exactly as in the case of probabilistic models, can be turned into CM by appealing to Born’s rule, a key
postulate of quantum theory. The existence of the named abyss proves itself through the fact that more than 100 years
after their conception, there seem to be irreconcilable differences in opinion about the interpretation of probability [7]
and quantum theory [8, 9]. The conundrum of not being able to deduce within the context of the latter theory that,
in general, each measurement yields a deﬁnite outcome [8, 9] has, for a Curie-Weiss model of the measurement
device, been shown to be amenable to detailed analysis without invoking elusive concepts such as the wave function
collapse [10–12].
From the foregoing, it is clear that discretizing differential equations or using of pseudo-random number gener-
ators, maps M2Cs onto CMs. This category of CMs is “inspired” by M2Cs. In contrast, there are CMs that are not
based, also do not have any relation to, one of the M2Cs that are used to describe physical phenomena. They are
deﬁned by specifying a set of rules, an algorithm. A prominent example of such a CM is a pseudo-random number
generator. Its algorithm consists of a set of arithmetic operations, designed to create the illusion that the numbers
being generated are unpredictable. More generally, discrete event simulations belong to this category of CMs.
In many but not all cases, the discrete data generated by laboratory experiments, computer experiments on a digital
computer and classical physics model may directly be confronted with each other, as indicated by the red rectangle
containing the three discrete data boxes in Fig. 1. For instance, we can compare the observed trajectory of a satellite
with the numerical solution of the classical equation of motion for that object.
In general, the comparison between experimental data and discrete data obtained from model calculations is
through averages, correlations, etc., that is through quantities that capture the salient features of the discrete data.
The applicability of the models is established a posteriori by comparing their features with those of the laboratory
experiment or, if the latter is not available, by comparing features among models.
If the comparison is considered to be successful (by some necessarily subjective criterion), as indicated by the
smiley, the MM has been validated. If the MM does not describe the discrete data, it is not “wrong” (assuming it is
mathematically sound). Then, we have two options. First, following common practice of all subﬁelds of physics, we
should try to include into the MM elements that are of relevance to the real experiment but have been left out in the
construction of the MM. Second, like in the case of classical mechanics failing to describe relativistic mechanics, one
has to come up with a new MM, a task that is much more daunting than the ﬁrst one.
With one exception, all the arrows in Fig. 1 are unidirectional. Therefore, if the comparison between experimental
data and a MM (e.g., a probabilistic or a quantum model) is found to be unsatisfactory (by whatever criterion), it is
a logical fallacy to conclude that one of the premises underlying the MM must be “wrong”. The logically correct
conclusion is that the predictions of the MM in terms of averages, correlations, etc. do not agree. Of course, logically
unjustiﬁed conclusions may sometimes provide inspiration to construct other MMs that eliminate some or all of the
differences in their predictions.
Nevertheless, once the model has been validated, the assumption that the phenomenon, which was the subject of
the laboratory experiment, shares the same properties as the model is expressing a belief, a logical fallacy of false
analogy.
A recurring theme of this paper is that there is no direct relation between any of the properties of CMs, MMs
(all contained in the green area of Fig. 1), and those of natural phenomena or laboratory experiments. In this view,
there exists an impenetrable barrier between discrete data produced by (computer) experiments and MMs designed to
capture the salient features of these data, see Fig. 1. Indeed, there is no reason why valid “theorems” derived from a
MM should have a bearing on “reality” represented by discrete data. The idea that they would have a bearing reminds
us of the “mind projection fallacy”, the assertion that one’s own thoughts and sensations are realities existing in the
world in which we live [7, p. 22].
1.1. Some further thoughts on relations between “model” (theory) and “reality”
To the best of our knowledge, a view similar to the “mind projection fallacy” was ﬁrst clearly expressed in Heinrich
Hertz’ last work “Die Prinzipien der Mechanik in neuem Zusammenhange dargestellt (1894)” [13]. In the introduc-
tion, Hertz discussed the relation between object and observer, subject and object, nature and culture, theory and
practice. In the introduction he wrote [14] “We form for ourselves mental pictures or symbols of external objects;
and the form which we give them is such that the necessary consequences of the pictures in thought are always the
5

pictures of the necessary consequences in nature of the things pictured.” Hertz’s position represents a signiﬁcant
departure from Galileo’s view that the “book of nature is written in geometric symbols”, a position which does not
assume that the mathematical symbols used in physical theories have meaning outside these theories. The ﬁrst lines
of Ref. [15] read “Any serious consideration of a physical theory must take into account the distinction between the
objective reality, which is independent of any theory, and the physical concepts with which the theory operates. These
concepts are intended to correspond with the objective reality, and by means of these concepts we picture this reality
to ourselves.”, which seem to be in concert with Hertz’ view. An in-depth discussion of the relevance of Hertz’ view
to the foundations of quantum theory can be found in Ref. [16].
More generally, the essential part of the whole philosophy, from Ancient Greece to modern times, is related to the
problem of the adequacy of our worldview and its relation to “reality” (whatever that “reality” means). Of course, it
is far beyond both the scope of the paper and the expertise of the authors to discuss this issue in its generality, but
several remarks seem to be not only useful but even necessary.
• There is a strong tendency to identify our description of reality, represented in a mathematical way, with reality.
Usually, this tendency is associated with the philosophy of Plato and his followers but one can go even farther
in the past, e.g., to Pythagoras. Importantly, this view is still alive and quite popular among physicists and
mathematicians, the philosophical views of Heisenberg probably being the most striking example [17]. There
are many varieties of this worldview but, roughly speaking, mathematics is identiﬁed with the deepest level of
“reality”. Our physical world is supposed to be a shadow of this true, or supreme, reality.
• One advantage of this approach is obvious: “the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in natural sci-
ences” [18] is no longer a problem. Strangely enough, counterexamples to this statement such as the famous
Banach-Tarski paradox [19] are routinely ignored. In our physical world, we cannot cut a ball into a ﬁnite num-
ber of pieces and reconnect them into a ball twice the size of the original ball. This observation alone should
force us to reconsider the idea that the connection between the world of mathematical concepts and the physical
world are related in trivial way.
• Importantly enough, even accepting Plato’s main concept does not imply, in any way, that this divine mathemat-
ics, this supreme reality, should coincide with our human mathematics. The latter may be merely a projection,
and the procedure of projecting could change dramatically its character. There is some analogy with Bohr’s
complementarity principle: an electron is neither wave nor particle but these concepts naturally arise with our
attempts to describe the results of interaction of invisible micro objects like the electron with macroscopic
measuring devices [20]. We cannot go deeper into this analogy here but should mention that there is also the
complementarity of continuity and discreteness which seems to be an unavoidable property of such a projec-
tion [20]. This is directly related to the fact that, as mentioned in the beginning of the introduction, the results
of physical experiments have ﬁnite precision and are represented by discrete numbers.
• The previous observations imply that even if we take the idealistic positions in spirit of Plato or Hegel philoso-
phies, one needs to distinguish carefully between superior reality, whatever rational and even mathematical it
may be by itself, and its reﬂection in one’s mind, unavoidably restricted by our own everyday experience, by
our language reﬂecting this experience (“The limits of my language mean the limits of my world” [21]) and by
physiology of our bodies and brains.
• The Hertzian view on scientiﬁc theories as images of reality seems to be careful enough in this respect. The rest
depends on our general world view. For example, if we believe in evolution and in the origin of our mind as a
result of this evolution, these images should be correct, at least to some signiﬁcant degree. Indeed, our survival,
as well as the survival of our ancestors, heavily depends on them. This world view already enforces some quite
strong restrictions on the structure of both our mind and physical reality [22].
• However, the previous statement should not be misunderstood. What is required from the internal image (world
view) is its ability to make reasonably accurate predictions of the events in the external world. The power of
this ability is directly related to the requirement of the robustness of the description. The latter lies at the base
of our logical inference approach to the foundations of quantum theory [23]. Also, the compactness of the
representation of the information about the external world is crucially important to limit resources necessary to
6

operate with this information. In our separation of conditions principle we use this idea to construct the formal
framework of quantum theory [24].
2. Structure of the paper
In this paper, we demonstrate by means of the application to Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm (EPRB) experiments
and appeal to Bell’s theorem that building a one-way bridge from discrete data to a MM eliminates all the problems of
interpreting the results of EPRB experiments. The reason for this is simple. Starting from the discrete data, immutable
facts, instead of from imaginary MMs which usually support very rich mathematical structures, there is no room for
going astray in interpretations.
We start by describing the discrete data obtained by both EPRB thought and laboratory experiments, see sec-
tions 3, 4 and 5, and in Section 6, we present a new inequality for the correlations computed from these data. The
proof of this inequality does not depend on the existence of a MM for the process that (one imagines having) produced
the data. This inequality is “model free”, involving discrete data only. Correlations obtained from EPRB experiments
can never violate this inequality. This inequality contains the Bell-CHSH inequality, valid for discrete data, as a spe-
cial case. A violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality by discrete data only indicates that not all the data contributing to
the correlations can be reshufﬂed to form quadruples, see Appendix A for the deﬁnition of “quadruples”. It follows
that any interpretation of a violation of the latter in terms of an imagined physical process generating the data is a
logical fallacy of the kind mentioned earlier. A short note focusing on a derivation of this inequality for the simplest
case can be found in Ref. [25].
The model-free inequality puts a constraint on correlations computed from the discrete data but does not contribute
to the theoretical modeling of the EPRB experiment. In this paper we systematically scrutinize various alternatives for
constructing such models starting from the assumed or imagined features of the discrete data of an EPRB experiment.
We start by constructing, as opposed to postulating, the quantum-theoretical description of the EPRB experiment.
First, in Section 7 we apply the elementary theory of plausible reasoning to data obtained from reproducible and
robust EPRB experiments and derive, without using any concept of quantum theory, the expressions for the averages
and the correlation for a system of two spin-1/2 objects in the singlet state. This approach builds a bridge between the
discrete data produced by experiment and a theoretical model but does not provide insight into the process that led to
the data.
Second, in Section 8, we demonstrate how the requirement of separability of the condition under which the EPRB
experiment is carried out leads to the quantum-theoretical description of the averages and correlations obtained from
an EPRB experiment. Remarkably, a crucial step in this construction is the application of Bell’s theorem to the
Stern-Gerlach experiment. Section 8.1 contains a discussion about the efﬁciency of quantum theory in terms of
compressing data and Section 8.2 presents a proof of a no-go theorem for quantum theory of two spins-1/2 objects.
We also identify the point at which interpretations of mathematical symbols that appear in MMs lose contact with the
reality, represented by discrete data.
In Section 9 we confront the data of an EPRB experiment [26] with the quantum-theoretical predictions for two
spin-1/2 objects in the singlet state, debunking the popular statement that EPRB experiments conﬁrm these predic-
tions [27–31]. We also argue that it is not quantum theory but rather the practical realization of the EPRB experiments
that should be questioned.
Section 10 presents results of EPRB-like experiments performed by means of a superconducting quantum informa-
tion processor and show that this event-by-event generation of discrete data yields results that are in good agreement
with the quantum-theoretical description of the EPRB thought experiment.
Section 11 reviews non-quantum models (NQMs) that cannot (sections 11.1 and 11.2) and can (sections 11.5
and 11.6) reproduce the averages and correlations of two spin-1/2 objects in the singlet or product state. Additional
examples can be found in Appendix L. We also provide an alternative proof of Fine’s theorem [32, 33] and discuss
its implications in the light of the central theme of this paper.
In Section 12, we summarize the key ideas and results of our work.
In the main text, we only address the main points. Technicalities of proofs and examples illustrating the main
points are given in the appendices.
Finally, a remark about the notation used throughout the paper: discrete data generated by a real (computer)
experiments, e.g., AC,n, are labeled by a subscript C specifying the condition under which the data has been generated
7

and a subscript to label the instance (n) of the data item. The data most likely change if the condition C changes or the
experiment is repeated. Note that this notation does not refer to any particular MM. Objects that belong to the domain
of MMs are regarded as functions of the arguments that appear in parentheses, e.g., A(a,λ).

separated directions labeled by +1 and −1. The pair (a,c) determines the conditions, to be denoted by the subscript “1”, under which the data
(A1,n,B1,n) is collected. The values of A1,n and B1,n correspond to the labels of the directions in which the particles have been diverted. The result
of this experiment is the set of data pairs D1 = {(A1,1,B1,1),...,(A1,N,B1,N)} where N denotes the total number of pairs emitted by the source.
Note that according to our notational convention, the subscript “1” stands for the condition under which the experiment has been performed.
The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment was introduced to question the completeness of quantum the-
ory [15], “completeness” being deﬁned in Ref. [15]. Bohm proposed a modiﬁed version that employs the spins-1/2
objects instead of coordinates and momenta of a two-particle system [34]. This modiﬁed version, which we refer to as
the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm (EPRB) experiment, has been the subject of many experiments [26, 35–42] and
theoretical studies [1, 31–33, 43–87].
The essence of the EPRB thought experiment is shown and described in Fig. 2. Performing the EPRB thought
experiment under the ﬁrst condition deﬁned by the directions (a,c) yields the data set of pairs
D1
=
{(A1,n,B1,n)|A1,n,B1,n = ±1; n = 1,...,N} ,
(1)
where N is the number of pairs emitted by the source. In this paper, we reserve the symbol A (B) for representing
discrete data (if it carries subscripts denoting conditions or a model function thereof if it has arguments enclosed in
parentheses) originating from stations 1 (2) of the EPRB experiment shown in Fig. 2.
Repeating the EPRB thought experiment under the three conditions (a,d), (b,c), and (b,d) yields the correspond-
ing data sets D2, D3 and D4. We repeat once more that according to our notational convention, the subscripts represent
the condition under which the experiment has been performed.
The data sets Ds for s = 1,2,3,4 are imagined exhibiting the following features:
1. There is no relation between the numerical values of As,n and As,n′ if n ̸= n′ and similarly for Bs,n and Bs,n′. This
implies that, based on the knowledge of all As,n̸=m and all Bs,n̸=m, it is impossible to predict As,m or Bs,m with
certainty. Similarly, it is impossible to predict with certainty As,m or Bs,m knowing all As′,n or Bs′,n for all s′ ̸= s
and all n.

Inspired by the quantum-theoretical description of the EPRB thought experiment (see Appendix M), the data sets
Ds for s = 1,2,3,4 are imagined exhibiting the following additional features:

Postselect by time-coincidence window W
Figure 3: Schematic diagram of an EPRB experiment with photons performed by Weihs et al. [26, 88]. A source emits pairs of photons in spatially
separated directions. Photons arriving at station 1 pass through an electro-optic modulator (EOM) which rotates the polarization of the photon that
passes through it by an angle corresponding to the voltage applied to that EOM. The latter is controlled by a binary variable r1,n, which is chosen
at random [26, 88]. The two different angles to choose from in station 1 (2) are denoted by two-dimensional vectors a (b) and c (d). As the photon
leaves the EOM, a polarizing beam splitter directs the photon to either detector D+1 or detector D−1. Depending of the detection efﬁciency (about
5% [26]), one of these detectors ﬁres, producing either a signal x1,n = +1 or a signal x1,n = −1 and a time stamp t1,n. Each triple (x1,n,t1,n,r1,n) is
written to a ﬁle. The same holds for photons arriving at station 2. After all data has been written to the two ﬁles, that is when the experiment has
ﬁnished, a time window W is used to remove all data that does not satisfy a time-coincidence criterion [26, 88]. The remaining data is organized
in four data sets, corresponding to the four different values of the pairs of random numbers (r1,n,r2,n). Note that the values of the A’s (B’s) that
appear in say D1 (D3). and those that appears in say D2 may be different, even though they may have been recorded for the same angle a (b). The
four sets of discrete data D1, D2, D3, and D4 are the result of the experiment for the particular value of the time-coincidence window W.

4. Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm laboratory experiment
An EPRB laboratory experiment is, of course, more complicated than the thought experiment. In Fig. 3, we show
a schematic of the EPRB experiment with photons performed by Weihs et al. [26, 88]. In experiments with photons,
the photon polarization plays the role of the spin-1/2 object in the EPRB thought experiment depicted in Fig. 2 (see
Section 7.1). Prominent features of this particular experiment are that for each event that triggers the emission of
photons by the source, binary random numbers are used to select one of the two EOM settings and that all the time
tags and detector clicks are stored in ﬁles which can be analyzed long after the experiment has ﬁnished (as we do in
this paper, see Section 9).
A key element, not present in the thought experiment, is a procedure to identify pairs of particles. Many EPRB
experiments [26, 35–37, 88–90], use the t’s, the time tags, for coincidence counting. More recent experiments use
thresholds on the voltages generated by the transition edge detectors to identify pairs [41, 42]. In essence, in all cases,
the identiﬁcation procedure removes (a lot) of data from the raw data sets [26, 41, 42, 88–90]. As indicated in Fig. 3,
this procedure yields data sets of different size N1, N2, N3, and N4. In the following, to simplify the discussion and
notation somewhat, we truncate the four data sets by keeping only the ﬁrst N = min(N1,N2,N3,N4) data pairs. The
four data sets then read (see also Fig. 3)
Ds
=
{(As,n,Bs,n)|As,n,Bs,n = ±1; n = 1,...,N} ,
(3)
where s = 1,2,3,4 labels the different runs of the experiment.
The identiﬁcation process is irrelevant for the material presented in this paper, except for Section 9 and also for
sections 11.5 and 11.6 in which we brieﬂy discuss a probabilistic M2C and an event-by-event, cause-and-effect CM
which describe, respectively generate the raw data {xi,n,ti,n,ri,n} for i = 1,2 (see Fig. 3) and can reproduce the averages
and the correlation obtained from the quantum-theoretical description of the EPRB experiment. As indicated in Fig. 3,
the data that are subject to further analysis are only those that remain after the identiﬁcation process has played its
part.
4.1. What is the main issue?
The following is an attempt to explain the main issue without taking recourse to mathematics. Therefore, some
aspects which are important for a precise formulation of the issue have been left out. They are mentioned in the
sections that follow.
Referring to Fig. 2, imagine that the particle of a pair traveling to the left (right) is very close to the leftmost
(rightmost) magnet but has not yet interacted with it (we assume that there is no faster-than-light communication
between the particles). Also imagine that the distance between the two Stern-Gerlach magnets is so large that light
emitted by one particle will not arrive at the other particle before both particles complete their journeys by arriving at
one of the detectors. Under these conditions, changing the direction of the left (right) magnet cannot have an effect
on the particle passing through the right (left) magnet. Thus, under these circumstances, knowledge of A1,n’s (B1,n’s)
value cannot affect B1,n’s (A1,n’s) value. The picture of what happens to the particle going left is completely separated
from the picture of what happens to the particle going right.
Next, consider the case in which the directions of the two magnets are either parallel or antiparallel, that is c = ±a.
Then, according to the features of the data listed above,
1. the values of the A1,n and B1,n for the nth pair, are unpredictable, randomly taking values ±1.
2. The value of the product A1,nB1,n = ∓1 for all n = 1,...,N pairs, depending on the direction c = ±a of the
magnets.
Thus, even though the value of, say A1,n is random, once it is known, because of the assumed perfect (anti)correlation,
see the above feature 2, the value of B1,n is known too, even before it is actually recorded.
In 1964, Bell [43] presented a simple model that (i) describes the two-particle system in terms of two separated
one-particle systems and (ii) provides a picture of the observations that we have just described. The two one-particle
systems are separated in the sense that what happens to a particle only depends on the direction of the Stern-Gerlach
magnet with which it interacts and on some variables that it shares with the other particle, the initial values of which
are determined at the time the particles leave the source.
10

In the same paper [43], Bell also proved his theorem (see Section 11.1 for a precise statement of the theorem)
stating that there does not exist a description in terms of two separated one-particle systems that yields the correla-
tion (−a · c) of two spin-1/2 objects in a singlet state. Thus, although Bell’s simple model can reproduce the main
features listed in points 1 and 2 above, it fails to agree with the quantum-theoretical description of the EPRB thought
experiment.
The key question is then “what is the outcome of an EPRB laboratory experiment?” Instead of generating data
for many directions of the Stern-Gerlach magnets and comparing the correlation with the quantum-theoretical result
−a · c, it is easier to demonstrate a violation of the so-called Bell-CHSH inequality (see Section 6), an inequality
that Bell used to prove his theorem. The argument is that any two-particle system which can be separated into two
one-particle systems as envisaged by Bell cannot violate a Bell-CHSH inequality. Therefore, the argument goes, if the
experimental data violates the Bell-CHSH inequality, the “separability principle”, which asserts that any two spatially
separated systems possess their own separate real states [91], or in Bell’s words, that “mutually distant systems are
independent of one another” [92], must be abandoned.
The main issue is that the logic of this argument is seriously ﬂawed. The Bell-CHSH inequality holds for some
MMs but certainly not for experimental data (see Section 6). Thus, a violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality by
experimental data can only imply that this particular MM does not apply to the experiment. Moreover, as shown in
Section 9, the analysis of data obtained from an EPRB laboratory experiment shows that (i) under suitable conditions,
this experiment yields −a · c to good approximation and (ii) by changing these conditions a little, that correlation
becomes compatible with the results of a separable, Bell-like model. From the viewpoint portrayed by Fig. 1, none
of the apparent conﬂicts is surprising. They all result from the idea that “theorems” derived in the context of a MM
have a bearing on the “reality” represented by experimental data. As mentioned in Section 1, if a MM leads to
the conclusion that there is a conﬂict with the “reality” represented by experimental data, the appropriate course of
action is to revise/extend/abandon the MM, not immediately call into question the elementary concepts on which our
picture-building of natural phenomena is based.
5. Description of discrete data: statistics
As the A’s and B’s with different indices n and different indices s are assumed to be unrelated, the order in which
data items appear is irrelevant for the characterization of the data set. In this case, the (relative) frequencies by which
a pair of values (x,y) (x,y = ±1) appears in the data set Eq. (1) are sufﬁcient to characterize this data set. Formally,
for the data collected under condition s = 1,2,3,4, these frequencies are deﬁned by
fs(x,y) = 1
N
N
∑
n=1
δx,As,nδy,Bs,n = 1
4N
N
∑
n=1
(1+xAs,n)(1+yBs,n)
,
x,y = ±1 ,
(4)
where the Kronecker delta δi,j takes the value one if the variables i and j are equal and is zero otherwise. By
construction 0 ≤fs(x,y) ≤1 and ∑x,y=±1 fs(x,y) = 1. Frequencies, such as the one deﬁned by Eq. (4), are discrete-
valued functions of the variables x and y which take discrete values and are denoted as such, using the subscript “s”
to indicate that the data has been collected under the conditions represented by the symbol “s”. Frequencies belong to
the domain of discrete data, not to M2C.
As it is clear from Eq. (4), computing a frequency is a form of data compression. In this particular case, computing
the frequencies Eq. (4) compresses the whole data set Eq. (1) to three, discrete-valued numbers (three instead of four
because of the normalization).
From Eq. (4) it follows immediately that the averages and the correlation and their relation to the frequencies
11

Eq. (4) are given by

showing that the frequencies Eq. (4) or the expectations E(1)
s , E(2)
s , and E(12)
s
are equivalent characterizations of the
data in the set Eq. (3).
Later, we need the notion of “independence” and this is a good place to discuss this notion. The two vari-
ables x and y are said to be independent if the frequency fs(x,y) can be written in the factorized form fs(x,y) =
f (1)
s
(x|a,c)f (2)
s
(y|a,c) where f (i)
s (z) = (1+zE(i)
s )/2 for i = 1,2 are the marginal frequency distributions of fs(x,y).
Equation (5d) shows that x and y are independent if and only if the correlation E(12)

= 0. In general, in-
dependence implies vanishing correlation [4] but for two-valued variables the vanishing of correlations also implies
independence.
Keeping the condition ﬁxed, different data sets Ds that yield the same frequencies fs(x,y) are equivalent in the
sense that they yield the same values for the averages and the correlation. Repeating an EPRB laboratory experiment
with the same conditions is expected (see Section 7) to yield numerical values of the frequencies fs(x,y) that are
subject to statistical ﬂuctuations which decrease as the number of pairs N increases.
6. Model-free inequality for correlations computed from discrete data
Motivated by the work of Bell [93] and Clauser et al. [94, 95], many EPRB experiments [26, 36, 37, 39–42] focus
on demonstrating a violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality [93, 94]. To this end, one collects experimental data for
four, well-chosen conditions denoted by 1, 2, 3 and 4, and computes the corresponding correlations according to
Eq. (5c).
In Appendix B, we present a rigorous proof that for any (real or computer or thought) experiment producing
discrete data in the range [−1,+1], the correlations computed from the four data sets Eq. (3) must satisfy the model-
free inequalities

where 0 ≤∆≤1 is the maximum fraction of quadruples that can be found by rearranging/reshufﬂing the data in D1,
D2, D3, and D4 without affecting the value of the correlations E(12)
1
, E(12)
2
, E(12)
3
, and E(12)
4
. For a detailed description
of the reshufﬂing procedure and the deﬁnition of quadruples, see Appendix B. We emphasize that inequality Eq. (6)
holds for discrete data in the range [−1,+1], independent of how the data was generated and/or processed and, most
importantly independent of any MM. In essence, the upper bound 4−2∆in Eq. (6) results from the fact that for every
quadruple that we can create by reshufﬂing data pairs in each of the four data sets, the contribution to the expression
on the left hand side of Eq. (6) is limited in magnitude by two, not by four.
The proof of Eq. (6) requires that the A’s and B’s that appear in the expressions of the correlations take discrete
values (ratios of ﬁnite integers) in the interval [−1,+1]. However, as mentioned in Fig. 2, the data produced by an
EPRB experiment is most conveniently represented by variables A or B taking values +1 or −1 only. In other words,
Eq. (6) covers both the case of data produced by EPRB experiments and general discrete data in the range [−1,+1].

It is expedient to introduce the Bell-CHSH function

(7)
where πππ4 denotes the set of all permutations of (1,2,3,4). By application of the triangle inequality, it directly follows
from Eq. (6) that for any (real or computer or thought) experiment producing discrete data in the range [−1,+1],
SCHSH ≤4−2∆.
(8)
The symbol ∆in Eqs. (6)–(8) quantiﬁes the structure in terms of quadruples exhibited by data D1, D2, D3, and D4.
If ∆= 0, it is impossible to ﬁnd a reshufﬂing that yields even one quadruple. If ∆= 1, the four sets can be reshufﬂed
such that they can be viewed as being generated from N quadruples. Then we recover the “model-free” Bell-CHSH
inequality for discrete data
SCHSH ≤2 ,
(9)
usually derived within the context of a MM (see Appendix I) [93–96].
In Appendix B.5, we brieﬂy discuss the extended EPRB experiment (EEPRB) [56, 97] which always generates
data for which ∆= 1. Perhaps somewhat counterintuitive is that ∆≲1 if all the A’s and B’s take independent random
values ±1, see Appendix B. In the case of interest, namely E(12)
1
= −a · c, E(12)
2
= −a · d, E(12)
3
= −b · c, and
E(12)
4
= −b · d, the maximum value over all directions a,b,c,d of the left-hand side of Eq. (6) is 2
√
2 ≈2.83 [98]
(see Appendix M.4), implying that the maximum fraction of quadruples which can be found in the data D1, D2, D3,
and D4 must satisfy ∆≤2 −
√
2 ≈0.59. In Appendix B, we present simulation results obtained by generating four
times one million independent pairs according to the quantum-theoretical distribution of two spin-1/2 objects in the
singlet state and obtain |E(12)
1
−E(12)
2
|+|E(12)
3
+E(12)
4
| ≈2.83 and 4−2∆≈2.83, strongly suggesting that the value
of quantum-theoretical upper bound 2
√
2 is reﬂected in the fraction of quadruples that one can ﬁnd by reshufﬂing the
data.
Suppose that the (post processed) data of an EPRB experiment yields SCHSH > 2, that is the data violates
the Bell-CHSH inequality Eq. (9). From Eq. (8), it follows that ∆≤2 −SCHSH/2 < 1 if SCHSH > 2. Therefore,
if SCHSH > 2 not all the data in D1, D2, D3, and D4 can be reshufﬂed such that they originate from quadruples
only. Indeed, the data produced by these experiments have to comply with Eq. (6), and certainly not with the
Bell-CHSH inequality. The reason is that the Bell-CHSH inequality is obtained from Eq. (6) in the exceptional
case ∆= 1 in which all data can be extracted from N quadruples.
In other words, all EPRB experiments which have been performed and may be performed in the future and
which only focus on demonstrating a violation of Eq. (9) merely provide evidence that not all contributions to
the correlations can be reshufﬂed to form quadruples (yielding ∆< 1). These violations do not provide a clue
about the nature of the physical processes that produce the data.
More speciﬁcally, Eq. (6) holds for discrete data, rational numbers in the range [−1,+1], irrespective of how the
data sets Eq. (3) were obtained. Inequality (6) shows that correlations of discrete data violate the Bell-CHSH inequality
Eq. (9) only if not all the pairs of data in Eq. (3) can be reshufﬂed to create quadruples. The proofs of Eq. (6) and
Eq. (9) reﬂect a certain structure in the data. They do not refer to notions such as “locality”, “realism”, “non-invasive
measurements”, “action at a distance”, “free will”, “superdeterminism”, “(non)contexuality”, “complementarity”, etc.
Logically speaking, a violation of Eq. (9) by experimental data cannot be used to argue about the relevance of one
or more of these notions used as motivation to formulate mathematical models of the process that generated the
experimental data.
A violation of the original (non model-free) Bell-CHSH inequality S ≤2 may lead to a variety of conclusions about
certain properties of a MM for which this inequality has been derived. However, projecting these logically correct
conclusions about the MM, obtained within the context of that MM, to the domain of EPRB laboratory experiments
requires some care, as we now discuss.
The ﬁrst step in this projection is to feed real-world, discrete data (rational numbers in the range [−1,+1]) into the
original Bell-CHSH inequality S ≤2 derived, not for discrete data as we did by considering the case ∆= 1 in Eq. (8),
but rather in the context of some mathematical model, and to conclude that this inequality is violated. Considering the
13

discrete data for the correlations as given, it may indeed be tempting to plug these rational numbers into an expression
obtained from some mathematical model. However, then it is no longer clear what a violation actually means in terms
of the mathematical model because the latter (possibly by the help of pseudo-random number generators) may not be
able to produce these experimental data at all. The second step is to conclude from this violation that the mathematical
model cannot produce the numerical values of the correlations, implying that the mathematical model simply does
not apply and has to be replaced by a more adequate one or that one or more premises underlying the mathematical
model must be wrong. In the latter case, the ﬁnal step is to project at least one of these wrong premises to properties
of the world around us.
The key question is then to what extent the premises or properties of a mathematical model can be transferred to
those of the world around us. Based on the rigorous analysis presented in this paper, the authors’ point of view
is that in the case of laboratory EPRB experiments, they cannot.
Using only Eq. (6), the logically and mathematically correct conclusion one can draw on the basis of the corre-
lations computed from these data obtained under conditions (1, 2, 3, 4) (listed in Section 3) is that a fraction of the
experimental data Eq. (3) can be reshufﬂed to create quadruples. However, Eq. (6) and the conclusions drawn from
it do not signiﬁcantly contribute to the modeling of the EPRB experiment as such. To this end, we need to develop
MMs that describe the change of the data as the conditions change. In the sections that follow, we explore various
ways of constructing MMs which reproduce the features of the experimental data mentioned in Section 3.
7. Modeling data: logical inference
In the exact sciences, an elementary requirement for the outcomes of an experiment to be considered meaningful
is that they are reproducible. Obviously, in the case of the EPRB experiment, the (hypothesized) unpredictable nature
of the individual events renders the data set Eq. (1) itself irreproducible. However, repeating the experiment and
analyzing the resulting data sets, there is the possibility that the frequencies Eq. (4) computed from the different sets
are reproducible (within reasonable statistical errors). Or, if it is difﬁcult to repeat the experiment, dividing the data
set into subsets and comparing the frequencies obtained from the different subsets may also lead to the conclusion
that the data is reproducible.
In this paper, we assume that the frequencies Eq. (4) produced by the EPRB experiment are reproducible. But
even if the frequencies Eq. (4) are reproducible, they may still show an erratic dependence on a or c which can only
be captured in tabular form. The latter has very little descriptive power. Thus, in order for an experiment to yield
frequencies that allow for a description that goes beyond simply tabulating all values, the frequencies not only have
to be reproducible but also have to be robust, meaning that the frequencies should smoothly change if the conditions
under which the data was taken changes a little [23]. This is the key idea of the logical inference approach for deriving,
not postulating, several of the basic equations of quantum physics [23, 99–102]. We brieﬂy recall the main elements
of the logical inference approach as it has been applied to the EPRB experiment [23].
The ﬁrst step of the logical inference approach is to assign a plausibility [103] 0 ≤p(x,y|a,c) ≤1 for observing a
data pair (x = ±1,y = ±1) under the conditions (a,c). As explained in Appendix C, plausibility and (mathematical)
probability are distinct concepts but for the present, practical purposes, the difference is not important. Recall that
frequencies are discrete data whereas the concept of probability belongs to M2C.
The second step is to use the Cox-Jaynes approach [7, 104, 105], the notion of robust, reproducible discrete data
and symmetry arguments to derive, not postulate, p(x,y|a,c). The most general form of a function p(x,y|a,c) of
variables that only take values ±1 reads
p(x,y|a,c)
=
1+xE1(a,c)+yE2(a,c)+xyE12(a,c)
4
,
(10)
see also Eq. (5d). Specializing to the case E1(a,c) = E2(a,c) = 0 and accounting for rotational invariance by imposing
E12(a,c) = E12(a·c), we have [23]
p(x,y|a,c)
=
1+xyE12(a·c)

where 0 ≤θ = arccos(a·c) ≤π is the angle between the unit vectors a and c. Using the assumption that (xn,yn) and
(xm,ym) are independent if n ̸= m, we can express the plausibility to observe several pairs in terms of the plausibility
Eq. (11) for a single pair [23].
Expressing the notions of reproducible and robust statistical experiments mathematically leads to the require-
ments (i) that frequencies should be used to assign values to the plausibilities, thereby eliminating their subjective
character [23] and (ii) that, in the case at hand, the Fisher information

(12)
should be independent of θ, positive and minimal [23]. In Appendix D, we solve this optimization problem. From
Eq. (D.3) it is obvious that, discarding the irrelevant solution n = 0, the Fisher information is minimal if n = 1, yielding
E12(θ)
=
cos(θ +ϕ)
,
IF(θ) = 1 .
(13)
where ϕ is a constant of integration.
Requiring perfect anticorrelation (correlation coefﬁcient −1) in the case that a = c (θ = 0), the phase ϕ must be
equal to π and we obtain
E12(θ)
=
−a·c = −cosθ ,
(14)
and
p(x,y|a,c)
=
1−xya·c

.
(15)
The correlation Eq. (14) with the minus sign known from the quantum theory of two spin-1/2 objects in the singlet
state (see Appendix M), plays a crucial role in Bell’s theorem (see Section 11.1). Remarkably, the solution Eq. (13)
with ϕ = 0, that is E12(θ) = +a · c, cannot be obtained from the quantum theory of two spin-1/2 objects [24], see
Section 8.2.
It is worth noting that the derivation that led to Eqs. (14) and (15) does not make any reference to concepts of
quantum theory. Apparently, the requirement that an EPRB experiment yields unpredictable individual outcomes but
reproducible and robust results for the averages (which are zero) and perfect anticorrelation if a = c sufﬁces to show
that the correlation must be of the form Eq. (14), with the plausibility to observe a pair (x,y) given by Eq. (15). In
short, any “good” EPRB experiment is expected to yield Eq. (15).
Whether the theoretical description embodied in Eq. (15) survives the confrontation with the discrete data obtained
from experiments can only be established a posteriori. For instance, in Section 9 we plot Eq. (14) and the data given
by Eq. (5c) and ﬁnd satisfactory agreement in one case (Fig. 4a) and signiﬁcant disagreement in the other (Fig. 4b).
Not surprisingly, the same logical inference reasoning also yields a description of an experiment with an idealized
Stern-Gerlach magnet [23]. To see this, imagine that the particles leaving the rightmost Stern-Gerlach magnet (see
Fig. 2) in the direction labeled y = +1 (or y = −1) pass through another identical Stern-Gerlach magnet (not shown
in Fig. 2 but see Fig. F.11 in Appendix F) with its uniform magnetic ﬁeld component in the direction d and outputs
labeled by z = ±1.
Note that if an ideal Stern-Gerlach magnet is to function as an ideal ﬁlter device, we must require that z = y if
d = c. Otherwise, assigning the attribute/label y to a particle is meaningless. Furthermore, we assume that the average
of the z’s does not change if we apply the same rotation to c and d. Denoting c·d = cosξ, expressing the notions of
reproducible and robust statistical experiments as before and accounting for rotational invariance, it follows that the
corresponding Fisher information
IF(ξ)
=
∑
z=±1
1
p(z|ξ)
∂p(z|ξ)
∂ξ
2
> 0 ,
(16)
for the plausibility p(z|ξ) to observe the event z = ±1 under the condition ξ must be independent of ξ, positive and
minimal [23]. Solving the optimization problem [23] yields IF(ξ) = 1 and
p(z|ξ)
=
1±zcosξ

,
(17)
15

where the ± sign reﬂects the ambiguity in assigning +1 or −1 to one of the directions. In the following, we remove
this ambiguity by opting for the solution with the “+” sign.
Note that quantum theory postulates Eq. (17) (through the Born rule) whereas the logical inference approach
applied to “good” experiments yield Eq. (17) without making reference to any concept of quantum theory.
7.1. Polarization instead of magnetic moments
Most EPRB laboratory experiments employ photons instead of massive, electrically neutral magnetic particles.
The Stern-Gerlach magnets in Fig. 2 are then replaced by polarizers with their plane of incidence perpendicular to the
propagation direction of the photons (taken as the z-direction in the following). The unit vectors c and d, describing
the orientations of the axes of the polarizers can be written as c = (cosc,sinc,0) and d = (cosd,sind,0).
Let us ﬁrst model a thought experiment aimed at demonstrating perfect ﬁltering of the polarization. We imagine
placing two identical, ideal polarizers in a row (see also Fig. B.10). Repeating the steps that led to Eq. (17) and
requiring that a polarizer acts as perfect ﬁltering device for all c = d, we ﬁnd that reproducible and robust statistical
experiments are described by the plausibility (see Appendix D)
p(z|c−d)

.
(18)
Comparing Eq. (18) with Malus’ law for the intensity of polarized light (= many photons) passing through a polarizer,
we conclude that the solution with n = 1 is incompatible with experimental facts and should therefore be discarded.
The solution with n = 2 yields Malus’ law. As discussed below, quantum theory attributes this empirical ﬁnding to
the fact that photons are spin-one particles.
Repeating the derivation for the EPRB setup, with polarizers and photons instead of Stern-Gerlach magnets and
magnetic moments, we ﬁnd
E12(θ)
=
±cos2θ .
(19)
where θ = c−d = arccosc·d expresses the difference in the axis angles of the polarizers, replacing the Stern-Gerlach
magnets in Fig. 2. Requiring perfect anticorrelation (correlation coefﬁcient −1) in the case that θ = 0, only one of the
two solutions in Eq. 19 survives and we have E12(θ) = −cos2θ.
Equations (18) and (19) differ from Eqs. (17) and (14) by the appearance of the extra factor of two in the argument
of the cosine. Within quantum theory, this can be explained as follows. A photon is thought of as a massless,
electrically neutral particle with spin S = 1, with a quantized polarization that can only take two values ±¯h. In
contrast, a neutron for instance is a massive spin S = 1/2 particle, with a quantized magnetic moment that can only
take two values ±¯h/2. The extra factor of two stems from the difference between S = 1 and S = 1/2 particles.
Logical inference provides a mathematically well-deﬁned framework to model empirical, statistical data acquired
by reproducible and robust, that is “good” experiments. It does not provide pictures of the individual objects and
processes involved in actually producing the discrete data. LI models belong to M2C.
8. Modeling data: separation of conditions
Instead of postulating the axioms of quantum theory and reproducing textbook material (see also Appendix M), we
use the EPRB experiment to show that its quantum-theoretical description directly follows from another representation
of the frequencies Eq. (4). By doing so, we do not need to call on Born’s rule, for instance. We proceed directly from
discrete data and the logical inference description of Section 7 to the quantum-theoretical description. In doing so,
we avoid all metaphysical problems resulting from the various interpretations of quantum theory. Thus, we construct
a mapping from the data (the frequencies) to a M2C (quantum theory).
The basic idea is rather simple. Instead of using the standard expression
⟨x(c1,c2)⟩= ∑
k∈K
x(k)f(k|c1,c2) .
(20)
16

for the average of a function x(k) over the events k ∈K that appear with a (relative) frequency f(k|c1,c2), depend-
ing on conditions represented by the symbols c1 and c2, we search for functions bx(j,i|c1) and bf(i, j|c2) satisfying
|bx(j,i|c1)| ≤1 and 0 ≤| bf(i, j|c2)| ≤1 and for which
⟨x(c1,c2)⟩
=
∑
k,k′∈K
bx(k′,k|c1) bf(k,k′|c2) ,
(21)
yields the same numerical value as given by Eq. (20), for all ⟨x(c1,c2)⟩’s of interest. Note that the condition c1 appears
in bx(k′,k|c1) and not in bf(k,k′|c2).
Recalling the recurring theme of this paper, the transition from Eq. (20) to Eq. (21) is a jump over the
impenetrable barrier between data (facts) and models thereof. Although both representations yield the same
averages, any interpretation of the symbols bx(k′,k|c1) and bf(k,k′|c2) in terms of discrete data, in terms of
“reality”, is problematic. Indeed, there is no relation between bx(k′,k|c1) and bf(k,k′|c2) and actual discrete
data, other than that the sum in Eq. (21) yields these same numerical value for the average Eq. (20). The
symbols bx(k′,k|c1) and bf(k,k′|c2) do not belong to the realm of these data (facts), they live in the domain of
models only. In Hertz’s terminology, the connection with the original picture is completely lost. Having lost the
connection with “reality”, there is complete freedom regarding the interpretation one would like to attach to
the symbols bx(k′,k|c1) and bf(k,k′|c2). In this paper, we adopt a pragmatic approach. We refrain from giving an
interpretation to mathematical symbols except for those that represent the original discrete data which we aim
to describe.
In matrix notation bYk,k′(c) = by(k,k′|c), Eq. (21) reads
⟨x(c1,c2)⟩
=
Tr bXT(c1)bF(c2) = Tr bF(c2) bXT(c1) .
(22)
As Eq. (22) indicates, we will be searching for representations that allows us to separate the conditions c1 and c2, very
much like solving differential equations by separating variables [24]. Although the appearance of matrices played a
key role in Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics, the latter and the approach pursued here are only distantly related [24]. A
much more elaborate discussion of how the separation of conditions leads to the framework of quantum theory can be
found in Ref. [24].
The separation of conditions, applied to data produced by experiments performed under several sets of conditions
(c1,c2),(c′
1,c′
2),..., is regarded as successful if it yields a decomposition into models which depend on mutually
exclusive, proper subsets c1,c′
1,... and c2,c′
2,... of the conditions only, thereby reducing the complexity of describing
the whole [24]. In the following, to keep the presentation short, we limit ourselves to a cursory discussion of the
separation-of-conditions approach. A much more detailed treatment can be found in Ref. [24].
We illustrate the basic idea by application to the idealized Stern-Gerlach magnet, assuming that the frequencies of
counting z = ±1 particles are given by
f(z|c,d)
=
1+zc·d
2
,
⟨z⟩= ∑
z=±1
zf(z|c,d) = c·d ,
(23)
that is, by the logical inference treatment of the same experiment, see Section 7.
The key idea is to exploit the fact that any choice of the (in this case 2×2) matrices bF(c) and bP(z,d) for which
Tr bF(c) = 1
,
Tr bP(z,d)bF(c) = f(z|c·d) ,
(24)
yields an equivalent description of the data and realizes the desired separation of conditions.
Before embarking on the search for a representation of Eq. (24) in terms of matrices, it is worthwhile to ask “why
not try to ﬁnd a separation in terms of scalar functions ez(k,c) and ef(k,d) such that ⟨x(c1,c2)⟩= ∑k∈K ez(k|c) ef(k|d) ?”
In Appendix F, we show that Bell’s theorem, applied to the Stern-Gerlach experiment, prohibits a separation in
terms of scalar functions. Then, the next step is to search for a representation in terms of functions of matrices.
Conceptually, taking this step is very similar to introducing complex numbers for solving equations such as x2 = −1,
or using Dirac’s gamma matrices to linearize the relativistic wave equation. Indeed, introducing the matrix structure
implicit in Eq. (21) will permit us to carry out the desired separation.

Anticipating for the transition to quantum theory but without loss of generality, we may take as a basis for the
vector space of 2 × 2 matrices, the unit matrix e0 =

1


and the three Pauli matrices e1 = σσσx =

, and e3 = σσσz =

. The four hermitian matrices e0,e1,e2,e3 are mutually
orthonormal with respect to the inner product ⟨v|w⟩= (1/2)Tr v†w. Furthermore, Tr e0 = 2, e2
n = e0, and Tr en =
Tr e†
0en = 0 for n = 1,2,3.
In terms of these basis vectors we have, in general
bF(c) = f0e0 + f1(c)e1 + f2(c)e2 + f3(c)e3
2
,
bP(z,d) = p0(z,d)e0 + p1(z,d)e1 + p2(z,d)e2 + p3(z,d)e3
2
,
(25)
where the f’s and p’s can be complex-valued and the factor 2 was introduced to compensate for the fact that Tr e0 = 2.
The constraints expressed by Eq. (24) imply that
f0 = 1

p0(z,d)+ 1

∑
n=1
fn(c)pn(z,d) = 1+zc·d

(26)
Obviously, Eq. (26) is trivially satisﬁed by the choice fn(c) = cn for n = 1,2,3 and p0(z,d) = 1, pn(z,d) = zdn for
n = 1,2,3. It is easy to verify that this choice yields eigenvalues of bF(c) and bP(z,d) in the range [0,1] (recall that c
and d are unit vectors). From the arguments given above, it is not clear that the choice of f’s and p’s is unique, but
this does not matter for the present discussion (see Ref. [24] for more information). Our goal was to ﬁnd at least one
representation which describes the data and for which the conditions c and d are separated.
By construction, the matrix bF(c) has all the properties of the density matrix ρρρ(c) (see [24]). In quantum-theory
notation and with fn(c) = cn and pn(z,d) = zdn, we have
bF(c) = ρρρ(c) = 1+c·σσσ
2
,
bP(z,d) = 1+zd·σσσ
2
=⇒
∑
z=±1
zTr bP(z,d)bF(c) = c·d .
(27)
We emphasize that the quantum-theoretical description Eq. (27) has been constructed, not postulated as in quantum
theory textbooks, by searching for another representation of the same discrete data.
As mentioned before, Stern-Gerlach magnets act as ﬁltering devices. This follows from bP(z,d) = bP2(z,d), show-
ing that bP(z,d) is a projection operator. However, although bP(z,d) appears in the course of constructing a description
of the data, we should not think of bP(z,d) as an object that affects particles but only as a description of how the
frequency distribution of the particles changes when the particles pass through a Stern-Gerlach magnet.
The frequencies Eq. (5d) describing the outcomes of the EPRB experiment depend on two, two-valued variables
and two conditions a and c. Therefore, instead of 2 × 2 matrices, we now have to use 4 × 4 matrices. Repeating the
steps that led to Eq. (27) and making use of the separated description of the ideal Stern-Gerlach magnet Eq. (27), we
can construct, not postulate, the quantum-theoretical description of the EPRB experiment [102, 106]. Specializing to
the case bE1(a,c) = bE2(a,c) = 0 and bE12(a,c) = −a·c (see Eq. (14)) we obtain
ρρρ

(28)
that is, the quantum-theoretical description of the singlet state of two spin-1/2 objects.
Furthermore, for any ρρρ (such as Eq. (28)) which does not explicitly depend on a or c we have
bE1(a,c)
=
⟨σσσ1 ·a⟩= Tr ρρρ σσσ1 ·a = ⟨σσσ1⟩·a ,
(29a)
bE2(a,c)
=
⟨σσσ2 ·c⟩= Tr ρρρ σσσ2 ·c = ⟨σσσ2⟩·c ,
(29b)
bE12(a,c)
=
⟨σσσ1 ·a σσσ2 ·c⟩= Tr ρρρ σσσ1 ·aσσσ2 ·c = ∑
α,β
aαΓα,βcβ ,
(29c)
where the 3×3 matrix Γα,β = ⟨σσσα
1 σσσβ
2 ⟩. Equation Eq. (29) epitomizes the power of the quantum-theoretical descrip-
tion. It separates the description of the state of the two-spin system in terms of the expectation values ⟨σσσ1⟩, ⟨σσσ2⟩, and
Γα,β = ⟨σσσα
1 σσσβ
2 ⟩, from the description of the conditions (or context) a and c under which the data was collected.
18

Noteworthy is also that in general, the single-spin averages Eqs. (29a) and (29b) do not depend on c and a, respec-
tively. In this sense, quantum theory exhibits a kind of “locality”, “separation”, or perhaps better “independence”, in
that averages pertaining to particle 1 (2) only depend on a (c). Of course, the correlation Eq. (29c) involves both a
and c.
In short, separating conditions led to the construction of the quantum-theoretical description of the EPRB experi-
ment containing the following elements [6]
• The two-particle system emitted by the source has total spin zero and after leaving the source, the particles do
not interact.
• The statistics of the magnetizations, obtained by observing many pairs, is described by the singlet state |ψ⟩=
(|↑↓⟩−|↓↑⟩)/
√
2, or equivalently, by the density matrix Eq. (28).
• The single-particle averages ⟨σσσ1⟩= ⟨σσσ2⟩= 0 and the correlation Γα,β = −δα,β, implying bE1(a,c) = ⟨σσσ1 ·a⟩=
0, bE2(a,c) = ⟨σσσ2 ·c⟩= 0, and bE12(a,c) = ⟨σσσ1 ·a σσσ2 ·c⟩= −a·c.
8.1. Advantages and limitations of using quantum theory
The main advantage of using quantum theory as a model for the data is in the amount of compression that can be
achieved. This can be seen as follows.
For a ﬁxed pair of settings (a,c), the frequencies f(x,y|a,c) and the density matrix ρρρ, together with the projectors
M(x|a) = (1+xa·σσσ1)/2 and M(y|c) = (1+yc·σσσ2)/2, describe the statistics of D equally well.
If we repeat the EPRB experiment with M different pairs of settings and characterize the results by frequencies,
we need 3M numbers to represent the statistics (not 4M because f(−1,−1|a,c) = 1 −f(1,1|a,c) −f(1,−1|a,c) −
f(−1,1|a,c)).
On the other hand, quantum theory describes the statistics of all EPRB experiments for all possible settings
through the ﬁfteen real numbers that completely determine the density matrix ρρρ. To see this, we write the density
matrix as a linear combination of a basis of the Hilbert space of 4 × 4 matrices. One way to construct these basis
vectors is to form the direct product of each matrix from the set {1,σx
1,σy
1,σz
1} with each of the matrices from the
set {1,σx
2,σy
2,σz
2}. There are sixteen such 4 × 4 matrices with their corresponding coefﬁcients. Because Tr ρρρ = 1,
there are only ﬁfteen independent coefﬁcients, which are real-valued because ρρρ is a hermitian, non-negative deﬁnite
matrix [6] and all elements of the basis are hermitian matrices too.
It is easy to show that these coefﬁcients are completely determined by the six single spin averages ⟨σα
1 ⟩, ⟨σα
2 ⟩, and
nine two-spin averages ⟨σα
1 σβ
2 ⟩, with α,β = x,y,z. Thus, in theory, we need to perform only ﬁfteen experiments to
determine these expectation values and can then use these numbers to compute bE1(a,c) = ⟨σσσ1 ·a⟩, bE2(a,c) = ⟨σσσ2 ·c⟩,
and bE2(a,c) = ⟨σσσ1 ·aσσσ2 ·c⟩for any pair of settings (a,c), see also Eq. (29).
In conclusion, compared to the representation in terms of frequencies which requires 3M numbers to describe the
statistics of M EPRB experiments, the quantum-theoretical description requires only ﬁfteen numbers to describe all
possible EPRB experiments, a tremendous compression of the data if M is large.
Regarding limitations of the quantum formalism, the no-go theorem presented in Section 8.2 gives a ﬁrst indication
that there exist data which can be modeled probabilistically but does not ﬁt into the quantum formalism. It is also
not difﬁcult to see that, as a direct consequence of the linear structure of the density matrix ρ = (1 + a · σσσ1)/2 and
the projector M(x|c) = (1+xc·σσσ1)/2, quantum theory can never yield a frequency f(x|a,c) = (1+x(a·c)2)/2, for
instance. These limitations are, of course, outweighed by the power of quantum theory to compress the statistics of
the data in a way that probabilistic models cannot.
Finally, it is important to recall that the quantum formalism also applies to cases where the experimental data
does not come in the form of single items of discrete data, i.e., individual events. For instance, if an experiment
measures the speciﬁc heat of some material, there are no “individual events” to compute the statistics of, only a record
of numbers for the speciﬁc heat as a function of e.g., the temperature. Still, a quantum-theoretical model calculation
of the speciﬁc heat is based on Eq. (22), with suitable matrices bF(c1) and bX(c2), of course.

8.2. Quantum theory: a no-go theorem for a system of two spin-1/2 objects
Replacing the requirement of perfect anticorrelation by complete correlation, the solution of the logical inference
problem reads bE12(a,c) = +a·c. To prove that such a correlation is incompatible with quantum-theoretical description
of two spin-1/2 objects [97], we consider the more general case for which
bE1(a,c) = bE2(a,c) = 0 ,
bE12(a,c)
=
−qa·c ,
(30)
where q is a real number. Starting from the most general expression of the density matrix, Eq. (30) implies that [97]
ρρρ
=
1−qσσσ1 ·σσσ2
4
.
(31)
However, as the eigenvalues of σσσ1 · σσσ2 are −3,+1,+1,+1, the matrix Eq. (31) is only non-negative deﬁnite if q ≥
−1/3. In other words, Eq. (31) is not a valid density matrix if q < −1/3. This then allows us to state the following
no-go theorem:
There does not exist a quantum model for a system of two spin-1/2 objects that yields p(x,y|a,c) =
(1−qxya·c)/4 or, equivalently, the averages bE1(a,c) = bE2(a,c) = 0 and correlation E12(a,c) = −qa·c
unless −1/3 ≤q ≤1.
An immediate consequence is that there does not exist a quantum-theoretical description of a system of two spin-1/2
objects if
bE1(a,c) = bE2(a,c) = 0 ,
bE12(a,c)
=
+a·c .
(32)
This “no-go theorem” may be viewed as a kind of “Bell theorem”, although it is not a theorem about the limited
applicability of the separable model introduced by Bell (see Section 11.1) but rather a theorem about the limited
applicability of quantum theory. In contrast, a probabilistic model can yield Eq. (32). Indeed, P(x,y|a,c) = (1+xya·
c)/4 does exactly that.
8.3. Discussion
Recapitulating, starting from sets of two-valued data, we have constructed instead of postulated the quantum-
theoretical description of the ideal Stern-Gerlach and EPRB experiments by
(i) Assuming that the data sets were obtained by reproducible and robust, that is by “good”, experiments.
(ii) Requiring that the description of the data in terms of the relative frequencies can be separated in a part that
describes the preparation of particles with particular properties and other parts that describe the process of
measuring these properties.
At no point use was made of concepts that are quantum-theoretical in nature. The data being the immutable facts and
quantum theory being a very convenient, minimalistic M2C describing the data, there is no need to bring in Born’s rule
to “explain” how quantum theory “produces” data. By itself, a quantum-theoretical model simply cannot “produce”
data and, as a description, also does not need to.
Moreover, as the data is discrete, represented by two-valued variables, there is no need to postulate the quantization
of the spin. The transition from the statistical description in terms of frequencies of events to a representation in terms
of 2×2 matrices made it possible to decompose the description of the whole in simpler descriptions of the parts. It is
this decomposition that renders quantum theory a powerful mathematical apparatus to describe discrete data.
Starting from the model-free description of any four sets of data pairs presented in sections 5 and 6, sections 7
and 8 have shown how a combination of plausible reasoning and the basic requirement that a description of the whole
can be decomposed in simpler, separated parts leads to the construction of a MM, that is quantum theory, which can
capture the main features of these data.
In the two sections that follow, we scrutinize laboratory experiments which have been designed to produce aver-
ages and correlations of data that, inspired by the quantum-theoretical description of the EPRB thought experiment
(see Appendix M), are expected to exhibit the features of the “imagined” data, listed in Section 3.

9. Data analysis of an EPRB laboratory experiment with polarized photons
Most EPRB laboratory experiments focus on demonstrating that the measured correlation cannot be described
by Bell’s model, see Eq. (35), by showing that the Bell-CHSH inequality (see Appendix E.1) is violated. Perhaps
more interesting and ultimately more relevant is that the analysis of the data of several EPRB experiments points to a
conﬂict with the quantum-theoretical description of the EPRB experiment [27–31].
As the data analysis of very different experimental setups [26, 40–42, 88–90] all point to similar conﬂicts [27–31],
we only show and analyze the data acquired in one of the more complete and sophisticated EPRB experiments, the
one performed by Weihs et al. [26, 88], see Fig. 3. The protocol that we use to analyze these data is identical to the
one employed by the experimenters [26, 88], see Refs. [28, 29, 107] for more details.

(a): the correlation E(α + θ,β) as a function of the bias applied to Alice’s EOM for a time coincidence window W = 2ns. In the experiment,
the angle θ, which is proportional to the bias, changes every 5 seconds [88]. The number of coincidences during each 5 second period is at least
7500. The minimum of average times between detection events is ⟨δt⟩≈24000ns, an order of ten thousand larger than the time window W = 2ns
used to compute the correlations. The pair of setting (α,β) is chosen randomly out of four possibilities [26, 88]. Open squares: (α,β) = (a,c);
solid squares: (α,β) = (a,d); open circles: (α,β) = (b,c); solid circles: (α,β) = (b,d), where a = 0, b = π/4, c = π/8 and d = 3π/8. These
correlations cannot be obtained from Bell’s model (see Eq. (35) below). (b): same as (a) except that the time coincidence window W = 1000ns,
much smaller than ⟨δt⟩≈24000ns. These correlations are compatible with Bell’s model (see Eq. (35) below).
In Figs. 4 and 5, we present some results of our analysis of the experimental data [26]. A ﬁrst observation is that the
correlations E(α +θ,β) shown in Fig. 4(a) are in excellent agreement with the correlation bE12(a,c) = −cos2(a−c)
of a system of two photon-polarizations, described by the singlet state. The correlations shown in Fig. 4(a) have been
obtained by analysing the raw data with a time-coincidence window W = 2ns, four orders of magnitude smaller
than ⟨δt⟩≈24000ns, the average time between the registration of a pair of detection events. The correlations shown
in Fig. 4(a) cannot, not even approximately, be reproduced by Bell’s model, see Eq. (35) below.
Figure 4(b) demonstrates that by enlarging the time-coincidence window to W = 1000ns ≪⟨δt⟩, the maximum
amplitude of the correlations E(α + θ,β) drops from approximately one to about one half.
Note that a time-
coincidence window of W = 1000ns is a factor of twenty-four smaller than ⟨δt⟩≈24000ns, that is the frequency
of identifying “wrong” pairs is small. The minor modiﬁcation that lets Bell’s toy model comply with Malus’ law
(see Appendix L.2) yields C(a,c) = −(1/2)cos2(a−c), rather close to E(α +θ,β) shown in Fig. 4(b).
The analysis of the experimental data clearly demonstrates that the maximum amplitude of the correlations E(α +
θ,β) decreases as the time-coincidence window W ≪⟨δt⟩increases. Within the range 2ns ≤W ≪⟨δt⟩, W can
be used to “tune” the correlations E(α + θ,β) such that they are compatible with (i) Bell’s modiﬁed toy model
(see Appendix L.2) or two spin-1/2 objects described by a separable state (see Appendix M.4) or with (ii) two
spin-1/2 objects described by a non-separable pure state, e.g., a singlet state (see Appendix M).
Whether the polarization state is “entangled” depends on the choice of the coincidence window W. There-
fore, in this case, entanglement is not an intrinsic property of the pairs of photons. It is a property of the whole
experimental setup.
The obvious conclusion that one has to draw from the observation that the numerical values of the correlations
depend on the value of the time-coincidence window W is that any CM or MM that aims to describe this particular
21

EPRB experiment should account for the time-coincidence window (or another mechanism) that is required to identify
pairs of events. Phrased differently, the time-coincidence window is essential to the way the data is processed and
the conclusions that are drawn from them therefore have to be a part of the model description. Note that quantum
theory may be able to describe the experimental data for one particular W but lacks the capability to also describe the
W-dependence, simply because in orthodox quantum theory, time is not an observable.

Figure 5: (color online) Analysis of experimental data (data set called newlongtime2) recorded in the EPRB experiments performed by Weihs et
al. [88]. (a): the Bell-CHSH function |S| = |E(a,c)−E(a,d)+E(b,c)+E(b,d)| as a function of the time window W for a = 0, b = π/4, c = π/8
and d = 3π/8. The dashed line at |S| = 2 is the maximum value for Bell’s model Eq. (35), or a quantum system of two S = 1/2 objects in a
separable (product) state. The dashed line at |S| = 2
√
2 is the maximum value for a quantum system of two S = 1/2 objects in a singlet state. The
total number of photons detected on the left and right side during the experiment which lasted 60 s is 1733902 and 1621229, respectively. The
total number for coincidences with an absolute value of the time-tag difference less than W = 2ns is about 35000. The minimum of average times
between detection events is ⟨δt⟩= 35000ns, more than 30 times the maximum value W = 1000 of the time coincidence window used to plot |S|.
(b): selected single-particle averages as a function of the time coincidence window W, contradicting the quantum-theoretical description on a very
elementary level. Error bars correspond to 2.5 standard deviations.
The importance of including the time-coincidence window W in a model for this particular laboratory EPRB
experiment is further illustrated in Fig. 5(a). Figure 5(a) demonstrates that the experimental data might be represented
by Eq. (35) if the time coincidence window W is chosen properly, that is if the Bell-CHSH function |S| ≤2.
For W < 100ns, the value of |S| > 2 and the correlations are compatible with a quantum-theoretical description
in terms of a non-separable density matrix, but not with Bell’s model Eq. (35) because the latter implies that |S| ≤2.
From model-free inequality Eq. (6), it follows that if |S| ≥2, the fraction of quadruples ∆that one might be able to
identify in the data that led to Fig. 5(a) must be smaller than 2−|S|/2.
For 200ns < W < 1000ns, much less than the average time interval ⟨δt⟩= 35000ns between two detection
events, the value of |S| ≤2 admits a description in terms of a separable density matrix or, possibly, by Bell’s model
Eq. (35).
Clearly, the time-coincidence window W can be “adjusted” in a wide range, such that either |S| ≤2 or |S| > 2. In
other words, the “evidence” for a singlet state description appears or disappears depending on very reasonable choices
of W (that is W ≪⟨δt⟩= 35000ns). These results corroborate our conclusions drawn on the basis of the data depicted
in Fig. 4.
According to quantum theory, see Eq. (29), bE1(a,c) = ⟨σσσ1 ·a⟩and bE2(a,c) = ⟨σσσ2 ·c⟩should not depend on c and
a, respectively. For small W, the total number of coincidences is too small to yield statistically meaningful results. For
W > 20ns the change in some of these single-spin averages observed on the left (right) when the settings of the right
(left) are changed (randomly) systematically exceeds ﬁve standard deviations [28, 29]. Indeed, E1(a,c) and E1(a,d)
(squares in Fig. 5(b)) should, according to the quantum theory of a system in the singlet state, be independent of c and
d but in fact, they differ by at least ﬁve standard deviations. The same holds true for E2(a,c) and E2(b,c) (circles in
Fig. 5(b)).
In conclusion, although most EPRB experiments that have been performed so far have produced data that violate
the Bell-CHSH inequalities, these experiments do not produce data that agree with the quantum-theoretical description
of the EPRB experiment [27–31].

To head off possible confusion, it is not quantum theory which fails to describe the data. Indeed, given experi-
mental data for the averages uα = ⟨σσσ1 ·eα⟩, vα = ⟨σσσ2 ·eα⟩, wα,β = ⟨σσσ1 ·eα σσσ2 ·eβ⟩with ex = (1,0,0), ey = (0,1,0),

always yields a perfect ﬁt to this data if we allow the expansion coefﬁcients uα, vα, and wα,β to depend on a and c.
The conﬂicts between quantum theory of the EPRB experiment and experimental data can only be resolved by new,
much more accurate experiments.
In Section 11.5, we review a probabilistic model which complies with the separation principle and describes the
raw, unprocessed data of the EPRB experiment. In the limit of a vanishing time-coincidence window, this M2C yields
the quantum-theoretical results for the EPRB experiment [107, 108]. The latter implies that there is no fundamental
problem to have a MM produce (e.g., with the help of a pseudo-random number generator) data of the kind gathered in
an EPRB experiment and recover the quantum-theoretical results. Indeed, that is exactly what the subquantum model
described in Section 11.6 shows.
10. Quantum computing experiments
Instead of performing EPRB experiments with photons, one can also carry out their own EPRB experiments with
publicly accessible quantum computer (QC) hardware [109]. In the case of photons, disregarding technicalities, it
is not difﬁcult to realize situations in which there is no interaction between the photons of a pair at the time of
their detection because photons need a material medium to “interact”. In contrast, in superconducting or ion trap
quantum devices, the qubits are very close to each other [110]. The qubits of a physical QC device are part of
a complicated many-body system, the behavior of which cannot be described in terms of noninteracting entities.
Therefore, experiments with QC hardware are of little relevance to the EPR argument [15] as such. However, they
can be used to test to what extent a QC [110] can generate data sets D that comply with the quantum-theoretical
description in terms of the singlet state, that is bE1(a,c) = 0, bE2(a,c) = 0, and bE12(a,c) = −a·c. In contrast to EPRB
experiments with photons for which it is essential to have an external procedure (such as counting time coincidences
or using voltage thresholds) to identify photons, QC experiments can generate bitstrings for all qubits simultaneously
and identiﬁcation is not an issue.
In short, a QC is a physical device that is subject to a sequence of electromagnetic pulses and changes its state
accordingly. The often complicated physical processes induced by these pulses are assumed to implement a sequence
of unitary operations that change the wavefunction describing the state of the ideal QC [110]. The sequences of unitary
operations, constituting the algorithm, are conveniently represented by quantum circuits [110]. Actually executing a
quantum circuit such as Fig. 6 on QC hardware requires an intermediate step to translate the circuit into pulses. This
step is taken care of by the software of the QC hardware provider [109].

Figure 7: Transpiled version of Fig. 6 in terms of the native gates “X”, “Controlled X”, “Rz”, and “Sx”, used by the IBM-QE Manila device [111].
The software controlling the operation of an IBM-QE device transpiles the circuit Fig. 6 into the mathematically
equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 7 in which only so-called “native” gates appear [111]. It is the latter circuit that is
executed on the QC hardware.
In practice, a QC EPRB experiment consists of repeating the following three steps
1. Reset the device to the state with both qubits set to zero.
2. Apply the pulse sequences as speciﬁed by the circuit in Fig. 7.
3. Read out the state, yielding a pair of bits (bi,bj) taking one out of the four possibilities (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), or
(1,1).
The number of repetitions N is typically in the range 1000 – 10000. Each readout yields a pair (x = 1−2bi = ±1,y =
1 −2bj) which is added to the data set D1. From the N pairs of data items in D1, we compute the averages and the
correlation according to Eq. (5).
Figure 8 shows the results of performing EPRB experiments on the IBM-QE Manila device, using three different
pairs (i, j) = (1,2),(2,3),(3,4) of the 5-qubit device. The best results are obtained if we use qubits (2,3), in which
case the correlation E(12)
1
agrees with the quantum-theoretical result within 10%, a considerable improvement from
the 20% accuracy obtained with the IBM-QE devices available in 2016 [112]. The averages E(1)

and E(2)

are close to
zero, as they should be for two spin-1/2 objects in the singlet state.

Figure 8: (color online) Comparison between experimental data produced by the IBM-QE Manila QC device in September 2022 and the quantum-
theoretical description in terms of two spin-1/2 objects in the singlet state. For ﬁxed angles of rotation a and c, the circuit shown in Fig. 7 is
executed on the IBM-QE Manila QC device ten thousand times. For each pair of angles (α,β) = (a,c), the ten thousand pairs of bits that have been
generated determine the ten thousand values of (A1,n,B1,n) which are then used to compute the single spin averages and correlation according to
Eq. (5). In this set of experiments, a = 0 and c = 0,7.5,...,360 degrees. Solid line: correlation bE12(a,c) = −cos(a−c) of two spin-1/2 objects in

. (a): data obtained by using qubits (i, j) = (1,2) of the Manila device yields max|bE12(a,c)| ≈0.83; (b): using qubits (i, j) = (2,3)
yields max|bE12(a,c)| ≈0.90 with no visible asymmetry; (c): using qubits (i, j) = (3,4) yields max|bE12(a,c)| ≈0.90 and a curve which is slightly
shifted or asymmetric around c−a = 180 degrees.
Next, we perform QC experiments (employing qubits (i, j) = (2,3)) to compute the Bell-CHSH function |S| =
|E(a,c) −E(a,d) + E(b,c) + E(b,d)|. As in the EPRB experiment with photons (see Section 9), between every
repetition, a random number generator is used to choose between circuits with (α,β) in Figs. 6 and 7 corresponding
to the choices (a,c) = (0,45), (a,d) = (0,135), (b,c) = (90,45) and (b,d) = (90,135). The experimental results are
shown in Table 1.
24

Alternatively, assuming rotational invariance, we can use the data in Fig. 8 to calculate the value of the Bell-CHSH
function |S| = |E(a−c,0)−E(a−d,0)+E(b−c,0)+E(b−d,0)| = |3E(0,45)−E(0,135)| and ﬁnd |S| = 2.3496,
|S| = 2.5872, and |S| = 2.6529 for the runs employing qubits (i, j) = (1,2) (Fig. 8(a)), (i, j) = (2,3) (Fig. 8(b)),
and (i, j) = (3,4) (Fig. 8(c)), respectively. Apparently, using the data yielding the “best” curve (Fig. 8(b)) does not
necessarily result in the largest violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality.

|S| = 2.4609
As shown in Table 1, randomly selecting between one of the four pairs of angles in-between each measurement
reduces the value from |S| = 2.5872 to |S| = 2.4609. A similar reduction is obtained if for each sequence we alternate
between the circuit for ﬁxed (α,β) and a circuit that performs X operations on each qubit and discard the bitstrings
obtained with the latter. This reduction may be interpreted as some loss of coherence due to the switching between
different circuits in-between each measurement but may equally well be within the statistical errors (which we could
not test because of limitations on the use of the IBM-QE device).
We have also obtained estimates for ⟨σσσα
1 ⟩, ⟨σσσα
2 ⟩, and ⟨σσσα
1 σσσβ
2 ⟩for α,β = x,y,z by running nine different experi-
ments on the IBM-QE Manila QC device. From the results presented in Table 2, we may conclude that executing the
circuit that, in theory, yields a singlet state and performing measurements on the two qubits, produces data that can
be described by the density matrix ρρρ = (1−0.9σσσ1 ·σσσ2)/4, which is close to the density matrix Eq. (28) of the singlet
state and in concert with the results depicted in Fig. 8(b).
Table 2: The raw data for the expansion coefﬁcients of the density matrix Eq. (33) describing two qubits / two spin-1/2 objects. The data shows
that the density matrix describing the data is, to a good approximation, given by ρρρ = (1−0.9σσσ1 ·σσσ2)/4. This data was produced by the IBM-QE
Manila QC device in September 2022 using qubits (i, j) = (2,3).

Finally, by removing the “Controlled X” from Figs. 6 and 7, the resulting circuit computes the single- and two-
qubit averages for a two-particle system in a pure product state. The data (not shown) are in good agreement with the
results of the corresponding quantum-theoretical description.
In summary, the IBM-QE Manila device produces data which is in good agreement with the quantum-theoretical
description in terms of the singlet state and product state (after removing the controlled X from the circuit). As
mentioned earlier, these experiments have no bearing on the issue of separability of the two qubits/spin-1/2 objects, but
they do show that a many-body system can produce, in an event-by-event-like manner, data that is in good agreement
with the quantum-theoretical description of the EPRB experiment.

11. Non-quantum models
We take as the operational deﬁnition of a non-quantum model (NQM) any MM for which:
1. All variables of the model, including those which have not been or cannot be measured, always have deﬁnite,
not necessarily discrete, values.
2. All variables change in time according to a process complying with Einstein’s notion of local causality.
Note that this operational deﬁnition applies to MMs only and does not relate to realism, the belief that there exists an
external reality independent of anyone’s thought, knowledge or observation.
Part 1 of the operational deﬁnition rules out all probabilistic and quantum-theoretical models, which are M2C. The
reason for this has already been discussed in Section 1. We repeat it here in slightly different words. By construction,
neither probability theory nor quantum theory contain a speciﬁcation of a procedure that assigns values to the random
variables that connect these theories to the individual events that are at the core of, but external to, these MMs. Thus,
M2Cs do not comply with the ﬁrst requirement listed above but the combination of a M2C and pseudo-random number
generators providing deﬁnite values to these random variables does. Of course, the latter is a CM, no longer a M2C.
In this section, in formulating a MM, it is implicitly assumed that, when necessary, the MM is turned into a model
that generates discrete data (a CM) by including, into the description, an appropriate algorithm (e.g., a pseudo-random
number generator) that generates these data.
Part 2 of the operational deﬁnition, the “locality principle”, asserts that all physical effects are propagated with
ﬁnite, subluminal velocities, so that no effects can be communicated between systems separated by space-like in-
tervals [91]. This principle is related to but not the same as the “separability principle”. The latter asserts that any
two spatially separated systems possess their own separate real states [91], or in Bell’s words, that “mutually distant
systems are independent of one another” [92]. The approach of separating conditions [24], exempliﬁed in Section 8
extends the “separability principle” in that there is no reference to “spatially separated” or “mutually distant”.
A key question in the foundations of quantum physics is whether there exist NQMs that yield the statistical results
of the quantum-theoretical description of the EPRB experiment. The answer to this question is “yes” [2, 97, 107, 108,
113]. In the subsections that follow, we review an LHVM that fails at producing the (imagined) data of the EPRB
experiment (Section 11.1) and a M2C (Section 11.5) and a CM (Section 11.6) that both succeed.
11.1. Bell’s models and theorem
The quantum-theoretical description of the EPRB experiment in terms of two spin-1/2 objects described by the
singlet state yields for the correlation bE12 = −a·c (see Section 8 or Appendix M for more details). Bell demonstrated
that there is a conﬂict between the quantum-theoretical model of the EPRB experiment and a class of local realist
models [43, 93, 96].
First, Bell considered a model for the correlation C(a,c) of the form [43]
C(a,c)
=
−
Z
A(a,λ)A(c,λ)µ(λ)dλ , A(a,λ) = ±1 , 0 ≤µ(λ) ,
Z
µ(λ)dλ = 1 ,
(34)
where the function A(a,λ) is assumed to model the process that generates the discrete data in the EPRB experiment.
Bell gave a proof that C(a,c) cannot arbitrarily closely approximate the correlation −a · c for all unit vectors a
and c [43]. According to Bell himself (see Ref. [93](p.65)), this is the theorem. From Eq. (34) and A(a,λ) = ±1 it
follows immediately that C(a,c) = −1 for all a = c, a characteristic feature of the correlation of two spin-1/2 objects
described by a singlet state.
Subsequently, Bell showed that his theorem also holds for a more general expression of the correlation Eq. (34),
namely [93, 96]
C(a,c)
=

where the functions A(a,λ) and B(c,λ) are assumed to model the process that generates the discrete data in the EPRB
experiment.

Bell’s theorem only applies to MMs of the type Eqs. (35) and, as we show later by concrete examples, certainly
not to all MMs for the EPRB experiments. In fact, Bell’s theorem does not apply to MMs for the raw, discrete data
generated by EPRB laboratory experiments, see Section 9. For convenience of the reader, the standard proof of Bell’s
theorem is given in Appendix E. Alternative proofs for speciﬁc choices of the functions A(a,λ) and B(c,λ) that are
not based on Bell-type inequalities are given in appendices Appendix G and Appendix H.
MMs deﬁned by Eq. (35) are commonly referred to as local hidden variable models (LHVMs). The speciﬁcation
of the dependence of A(a,λ) on a and λ and of B(c,λ) on c and λ is an integral part of any LHVM. The symbol
λ stands for all “hidden variables”, taking values in a domain denoted by Λ. The term “local” refers to the fact that
for each value of λ, the value of A(a,λ) (B(c,λ)) does not depend on the value of c (a) (see Ref. [93], p.15,36).
This requirement of independence, made explicit by writing A(a,λ) and B(c,λ), guarantees that the model satisﬁes
Einstein’s criterion of local causality. Actually, this requirement ensures much more, namely that the choice of c (a)
can never have an effect on the value of A(a,λ) (B(c,λ)), not in the future nor in the past. In this sense, the term
“local” is somewhat unfortunate and misleading but in the spirit of “the child (Eq. (35)) should have a name”, the “L”
in LHVM is ﬁne as long as we keep in mind that “local” does not refer to Einstein’s notion of local causality.
In Eq. (35), the symbol λ stands for one or more variables. The integrals over λ in Eq. (35) may be deﬁned in
terms of sums running over a partition of the domain Λ in P elements Vi and letting P →∞. In particular we have
C(a,c)
=
P
∑
i=1
A(a,λi)B(c,λi)κ(Vi) ,
(36)
where λi denotes an arbitrary point in the partition element Vi, and κ(Vi) ≥0 is a measure of the “volume” of Vi
satisfying ∑P
i=1 κ(Vi) = 1.
With an eye on the divide between discrete data and MMs describing these data, consider the case where A(a,λ) =
±1 and B(c,λ) = ±1. Once the dependence of A(a,λ) and B(c,λ) and the partition of the domain Λ in P parts have
been ﬁxed, we can use a digital computer to generate the ±1’s. Therefore, in its discretized form Eqs. (36) and
when implemented as a CM, Bell’s MM actually produces discrete data. There is no barrier of the kind mentioned in
Section 1.
11.2. Extension of Bell’s theorem to stochastic models
Bell’s theorem can be generalized to stochastic models. With A(a,λ) = ∑x=±1 xP(x|a,λ) where 0 ≤P(x|a,λ) ≤1
denotes the probability for x = ±1 conditional on a and λ and similarly B(c,λ) = −∑y=±1 yP(y|c,λ), Eq. (35)
becomes
C(a,c)
=
−∑
x,y=±1
Z
xyP(x|a,λ)P(y|c,λ)µ(λ)dλ , 0 ≤µ(λ) ,
Z
µ(λ)dλ = 1 ,
(37)
and Bell’s theorem now says that there do not exist probabilities P(x|a,λ) and P(y|c,λ) such that C(a,c) = −a·c.
Once we move into the realm of probabilistic models, there are some new aspects that are not present in a model
that is formulated in terms of variables that take values ±1 only. One can argue that the values of the variables x and y
appearing in Eq. (37) are random and therefore not known at all times. Then, according to our deﬁnition, Eq. (37) does
not qualify as an NQM but Eq. (37) still qualiﬁes as a local, factorable stochastic model [47]. The latter is “local”
in the sense that mathematical entities, P(x|a,λ) and P(y|c,λ) do not depend on c and a, respectively. However,
as probabilities express logical relations, not always physical or causal relations [51], the fact that a and c appear
separated in Eq. (37) has no bearing on Einstein’s criterion of local causality being satisﬁed or not.
11.3. Proper probabilistic models
Any correct probabilistic description of the data collected in an EPRB experiment has to start from the probability
P(x,y|a,c) for the joined event (x,y), conditional on a and c. Let us try to express P(x,y|a,c) in terms of P(x|a,λ)
and P(y|c,λ). According to the rules of probability theory [4, 7], we may write
P(x,y|a,c) =
Z
P(x,y|a,c,λ)µ(λ) dλ =
Z
P(x|y,a,c,λ)P(y|a,c,λ)µ(λ) dλ ̸=
Z
P(x|a,λ)P(y|c,λ)µ(λ) dλ ,
(38)
where 0 ≤µ(λ) and
R µ(λ)dλ = 1.
To proceed, we have to make some assumptions, namely that it is allowed (or a good approximation) to
27

• replace P(y|a,c,λ) by P(y|c,λ),
• replace P(x|y,a,c,λ) by P(x|a,λ).
Probabilities express logical relations, not always physical or causal relations, a fact that is easily proven by consider-
ing an experiment involving a red and a blue ball (see e.g. Ref. [51]): It is perfectly ﬁne to compute P(“ﬁrst ball red” |
“second ball blue”) and P(“ﬁrst ball red”), which are in general not equal, even though, obviously, the second ball
drawn cannot physically inﬂuence the ﬁrst ball drawn. Therefore, we cannot call upon the requirement of Einstein’s
notion of local causality to justify replacing P(y|a,c,λ) by P(y|c,λ), see for instance [51]. As a matter of fact, within
a probabilistic setting, given that one has to start from Eq. (38), it is simply impossible to justify an expression such as
Eq. (37) on mathematical grounds. Of course, Eq. (37) may be useful as an “out-of-the-blue”, uncontrolled approx-
imation. The arguments against the justiﬁcation of Eq. (37) pertain to the probabilistic setting only. They cannot be
used against the justiﬁcation of Eq. (35) as an NQM of the correlation between the functions A(a,λ) and B(c,λ).
It is easy to write −a · c in the factorized form Eq. (37). For instance, in the case of polarized photons we may
write
−cos2(a−c) = 1
2π ∑
x,y=±1
Z 2π
0
xy1−x
√
2cos2(a−φ)
2
1−y
√
2cos2(c−φ +π/2)
2
dφ .
(39)
The fractions that appear in Eq. (39) can take negative values and therefore do not qualify as probabilities. In other
words, model Eq. (39) has to be rejected on elementary grounds.
11.4. Probabilities and Bell-type inequalities
For completeness and because probabilistic models are often used to argue that Bell-type inequalities only say
something about the existence of joint probabilities and probability spaces [32, 33, 48, 49, 52, 53, 55, 58, 59, 64, 66,
68–70, 72, 74, 75, 78–82, 114, 115], we collect some known results about the Bell-type inequalities in a probabilistic
setting [32, 33, 52, 114]. Our presentation differs from earlier ones [32, 33, 52, 114] in that we extensively use the
representation of the frequencies in terms of their moments.
The ﬁrst step in formulating a probabilistic model that describes the data generated by an EPRB experiment with
settings a and c is to introduce the probability P(x1,x2|a,c) of the event (x1,x2), where x1,x2 = ±1. As before, we
use the notation |a,c) to keep track of the context (condition) (a,c) in (under) which the experiment was performed.
With the aim of testing for violations of e.g., the Bell-CHSH inequality, repeating the experiment for different
pairs of settings (a,d), (b,c) and (b,d) yields data that, within the probabilistic model, are described by P(x1,x2|a,d),
P(x1,x2|b,c), and P(x1,x2|b,d), respectively.
In applying Kolmogorov’s probability theory, it is often silently assumed that the context for which the Kol-
mogorov probability space (KPS) (Ω,F,P) has been constructed is ﬁxed for the remainder of the discourse [3, 4].
However, a probabilistic model of the data obtained by four EPRB experiments with different settings (a,c), (a,d),
(b,c) and (b,d) has to explicitly account for these four different contexts. In general, each of the four bivariates
P(x1,x2|a,c), P(x1,x2|a,d), P(x1,x2|b,c), and P(x1,x2|b,d) has its own KPS.
In the case of the EEPRB experiment (see Appendix B.5), there is only one single experiment being performed
in the context (a,b,c,d). Therefore, the probability P(x1,x2,x3,x4|a,b,c,d) is well-deﬁned and so is the associated
KPS. In contrast, in principle only bivariates can be used to model data originating from an EPRB experiment simply
because conceptually and physically, it is impossible to perform the four EPRB experiments as a single experiment.
Consequently, in this case there does not exist a probability P(x1,x2,x3,x4|a,b,c,d) and a single KPS that describes
the data of the collective of these four EPRB experiments. However, we may relax the requirement of a joint KPS
a little and ask the mathematically interesting question if there are conditions that guarantee the existence of a joint
distribution ef(x1,x2,x3,x4) such that only some of its marginals, namely ∑x3,x4=±1 ef(x1,x2,x3,x4) = P(x1,x2|a,c)
etc., describe the data of the four EPRB experiments. Such conditions were ﬁrst established by A. Fine [32, 33].
Conditions for the existence of a joint distribution of three variables and a generalization to the many-variable case
are also given in Refs. [114] and [116], respectively.
The purpose of this subsection is to give an alternative derivation of these conditions in terms of moments such as
K1 = ∑x2=±1 x1P(x1,x2|a,c) and K12 = ∑x1,x2=±1 x1x2P(x1,x2|a,c) of the probabilities. In particular, we focus on the
28

statement that the Bell inequalities hold if and only if there exist a joint distribution ef(x1,x2,x3,x4) for all observables
of the experiment, returning the marginals P(x1,x2|a,c), P(x1,x2|a,d), P(x1,x2|b,c), and P(x1,x2|b,d) which describe
the data of the four EPRB experiments with the corresponding settings.
From the viewpoint of modeling experimental data, the existence of ef(x1,x2,x3,x4) does not bring additional
insight in the physical processes that generated the data. Whenever the conditions change and new data is col-
lected, we have to recompute ef(x1,x2,x3,x4) from the new data. Importantly, even if such a joint distribution
ef(x1,x2,x3,x4) is found to exist, this description of EPRB data accomplishes exactly the opposite of the sepa-
ration in parts, facilitated by the quantum-theoretical description. Indeed, the joint distribution provides a
description of the four particular experiments as whole.
In the following, we only consider real-valued functions f(x1,x2,...) of two-valued variables {x1 = ±1,x2 =
±1,...} for which N = ∑{x1=±1,x2=±1,...} f(x1,x2,...) ̸= 0. Then, we can, without loss of generality, replace f(x1,x2,...)
by f(x1,x2,...)/N such that the new f(x1,x2,...) is normalized to one. The existence of a normalized, nonnegative
real-valued function f(x1,x2,...) is a prerequisite for constructing a KPS [3, 4]. Our aim is to establish the equivalence
between the existence of a nonnegative, normalized function f(x1,x2,...) and inequalities involving the moments of
f(x1,x2,...).
Recall that (relative) frequencies are restricted to be ratios of ﬁnite integers, and are therefore discrete data belong-
ing to the domain of “reality”, as deﬁned in the introduction. As also explained in the introduction, probability theory
belongs to the class M2C which requires the introduction of concepts (e.g., “real” real numbers such as the square
root of 2) that are outside the domain of discrete data. Notwithstanding these conceptual differences, the equivalences
established in this section hold for both frequencies (discrete data) and probabilities.
11.4.1. Bivariates of two-valued variables
Without loss of generality, any real-valued, normalized function f(x1,x2) of the two-valued variables x1 = ±1 and
x2 = ±1 can be written as
f(x1,x2)
=
1+K1 x1 +K2 x2 +K12 x1x2
4
= 1+x1(K1 +K2 x1x2)+K12 x1x2
4
.
(40)
From Eq. (40) it follows that
1
=
∑
x1=±1 ∑
x2=±1
f(x1,x2) ,
(41a)
Ki
=
∑
x1=±1 ∑
x2=±1
xi f(x1,x2) , i ∈{1,2} ,
(41b)
Ki j
=
∑
x1=±1 ∑
x2=±1
x1x2 f(x1,x2) ,
(41c)
where the normalization of f(x1,x2) implies Eq. (41a) and the K’s are the moments of f(x1,x2).
If 0 ≤f(x1,x2) ≤1, application of the triangle inequality to Eqs. (41b) and (41c) yields |K1| ≤1, |K2| ≤1,
|K12| ≤1, and |K1 ±K2| ≤1 ±K12. Conversely, from |K1| ≤1, |K2| ≤1, and |K12| ≤1 it immediately follows from
Eq. (40) that f(x1,x2) ≤1. As |K1 ±K2| ≤1±K12 implies −x1(K1x1 +K2x1x2) ≤1+K12x1x2, it immediately follows
from Eq. (40) that f(x1,x2) ≥0. Therefore, we have
Theorem I: There exists a real-valued, normalized, nonnegative function f(x1,x2) of two-valued variables
with moments K1, K2 and K12 if and only if all the inequalities
|K1| ≤1 , |K2|
≤
1 , |K12| ≤1 ,
(42)
|K1 ±K2|
≤
1±K12 ,
(43)
are satisﬁed. The explicit form of f(x1,x2) in terms of its moments is given by Eq. (40).
29

11.4.2. Trivariate of two-valued variables
Without loss of generality, any real-valued, normalized function f(x1,x2,x3) of the two-valued variables x1 = ±1,
x2 = ±1, and x3 = ±1 can be written as
f(x1,x2,x3)
=
1+K1 x1 +K2 x2 +K3 x3 +K12 x1x2 +K13 x1x3 +K23 x2x3 +K123 x1x2x3
8
.
(44)
From Eq. (44) it follows that
1
=
∑
x1=±1 ∑
x2=±1 ∑
x3=±1
f(x1,x2,x3) ,
(45a)
Ki
=
∑
x1=±1 ∑
x2=±1 ∑
x3=±1
xi f(x1,x2,x3) , i ∈{1,2,3} ,
(45b)
Ki j
=
∑
x1=±1 ∑
x2=±1 ∑
x3=±1
xixj f(x1,x2,x3) , (i, j) ∈{(1,2),(1,3),(2,3)} ,
(45c)
K123
=
∑
x1=±1 ∑
x2=±1 ∑
x3=±1
x1x2x3 f(x1,x2,x3) ,
(45d)
where the K’s are the moments of f(x1,x2,x3) and Eq. (45a) is a restatement of the normalization of f(x1,x2,x3).
If 0 ≤f(x1,x2,x3) ≤1, it follows that all the K’s in Eq. (45) are smaller than one in absolute value. Further-
more, it immediately follows that the marginals f3(x1,x2) = ∑x3=±1 f(x1,x2,x3), f2(x1,x3) = ∑x2=±1 f(x1,x2,x3),
and f1(x2,x3) = ∑x1=±1 f(x1,x2,x3) are real-valued, normalized and nonnegative bivariates. For each of these bivari-
ates Theorem I holds, implying that |Ki ±Kj| ≤1±Kij for (i, j) ∈{(1,2),(1,3),(2,3)}.
Other inequalities involving moments follow by adding inequalities f(x1,x2,x3) ≥0 for different values of (x1,x2,x3).
For instance, we have
4[f(+1,+1,+1)+ f(−1,−1,−1)]
=
1+K12 +K13 +K23 ≥0 ,
(46a)
4[f(−1,+1,+1)+ f(−1,+1,+1)]
=
1−K12 −K13 +K23 ≥0 ,
(46b)
which can be combined to read |K12 +K13| ≤1+K23. Similarly, one shows that |K12 −K13| ≤1−K23, |K13 ±K23| ≤
1±K12, and |K12 ±K23| ≤1±K13.
Adding other pairs of inequalities, we obtain for instance
4[f(+1,+1,+1)+ f(−1,−1,+1)]
=
1+K3 +K12 +K123 ≥0 ,
(47a)
4[f(−1,+1,+1)+ f(+1,−1,+1)]
=
1+K3 −K12 −K123 ≥0 ,
(47b)
which can be combined to read |K123 +K12| ≤1+K3. Similarly, one shows that |K123 −K12| ≤1−K3, |K123 ±K13| ≤
1±K2, and |K123 ±K23| ≤1±K3.
Conversely, assume that 1+K3 +K12 +K123 ≥0, 1+K1 +K2 +K12 ≥0, and 1+K12 +K13 +K23 ≥0 and consider
the expression X = 1+K1 +K2 +K3 +K12 +K13 +K23 +K123. Using K123 ≥−1−K3 −K12 we have X ≥K1 +K2 +
K13 +K23 and using K1 +K2 ≥−1−K12 ≥0 we obtain X ≥−1−K12 +K13 +K23 which, by virtue of K13 +K23 ≥
−1 −K12, is nonnegative. Similarly, one can show that all eight expressions of f(x1,x2,x3) are nonnegative if all
inequalities between all the ﬁrst, all the second, and the third moments hold.
Collecting all these inequalities, we have
Theorem II: There exists a real-valued, normalized, nonnegative function f(x1,x2,x3) of two-valued vari-
ables with moments given by Eq. (45) if and only if all the inequalities
|K1|
≤
1 , |K2| ≤1 , |K3| ≤1 ,|K12| ≤1 ,|K13| ≤1 , |K23| ≤1 ,
(48a)
|K1 ±K2|
≤
1±K12 , |K1 ±K3| ≤1±K13 , |K2 ±K3| ≤1±K23 ,
(48b)
|K12 ±K13|
≤
1±K23 , |K12 ±K23| ≤1±K13 , |K13 ±K23| ≤1±K12 ,
(48c)
|K123 ±K12|
≤
1±K3 , |K123 ±K13| ≤1±K2 , |K123 ±K23| ≤1±K1 , |K123| ≤1 ,
(48d)
are satisﬁed. The explicit form of f(x1,x2,x3) in terms of its moments is given by Eq. (44).
30

Clearly, there is a lot of redundancy in Eq. (48). There are 36 inequalities in Eqs. (48b)–(48d) but we need only eight
inequalities to express the requirement that f(x1,x2,x3) ≥0. We list the inequalities involving the moments in the
form Eq. (48) to display the symmetry with respect to the indices 1, 2, and 3 and to emphasize that Eq. (48c) directly
relates to all Bell-type inequalities involving correlations (the Kij’s) obtained from runs of the EPRB experiments with
three different pairs of settings. Note that because of Eq. (N.6), if one of the pair of inequalities in Eq. (48c) holds,
also the other two pairs also hold.
Rewriting Eq. (48d) as
−1∓Ki ∓Kjk ≤K123 ≤1±Ki ∓Kjk , (i, j,k) = (1,2,3),(2,1,3),(3,1,2) ,
(49)
it follows that
−1+ max
(i,j,k)|Ki +Kjk| ≤K123 ≤1−max
(i,j,k)|Ki −Kjk| , (i, j,k) = (1,2,3),(2,1,3),(3,1,2) .
(50)
Assume that we are given ﬁrst and second moments that satisfy the inequalities Eqs. (48a)–(48c). Then, according
to Eq. (50) and Theorem II, we can always ﬁnd a value of K123 such that the resulting expression Eq. (44) is a
normalized nonnegative function f(x1,x2,x3). Therefore, there exist a normalized, nonnegative trivariate of three
two-valued variables if and only if the ﬁrst and second moments satisfy the inequalities Eqs. (48a)–(48c).
11.4.3. Quadrivariate of two-valued variables
EPRB experiments with photons aiming at demonstrating a violation of the CHSH inequality require collecting
data for four different pairs of contexts/conditions. As it is physically impossible to perform the four EPRB experi-
ments in one run of an experiment, there does not exist a probability P(x1,x2,x3,x4|a,b,c,d) and a single KPS that
describes the data of these four EPRB experiments. As a matter of principle, four bivariates with different KPS’s are
required to model the data originating from the four runs of the EPRB experiments.
However, as mentioned earlier, it is of interest to ask for the conditions that guarantee the existence of a joint
probability ef(x1,x2,x3,x4) such that some of its bivariate marginals yield moments that describe the data of the four
EPRB experiments. This question was ﬁrst considered and answered by A. Fine [32, 33].
Without loss of generality, any real-valued, normalized function f(x1,x2,x3,x4) of the two-valued variables x1 =
±1, x2 = ±1, x3 = ±1, and x4 = ±1 can be written as
f(x1,x2,x3,x4)
=

Using the triangle inequality, it is easy to show that none of the K’s exceeds one in absolute value.
31

Summing Eq. (51) over one of the four variables yields the trivariate marginals
f4(x1,x2,x3)
=
1+K1 x1 +K2 x2 +K3 x3 +K12 x1x2 +K13 x1x3 +K23 x2x3 +K123 x1x2x3

(53d)
Trivariates are called “compatible” if their common ﬁrst and second moments are the same. The trivariates in Eq. (53)
are pairwise compatible. For instance, we have ∑x2=±1 f1(x2,x3,x4) = ∑x1=±1 f2(x1,x3,x4) = (1 + K3 x3 + K4 x4 +
K34 x3x4)/4, showing that f1(x2,x3,x4) and f2(x2,x3,x4) have the same moments K3, K4, and K34.
As in the case of the trivariate, linear combinations of f(x1,x2,x3,x4) ≥0 with different (x1,x2,x3,x4) yield in-
equalities in terms of the K’s. However, it saves work to use the inequalities Eq. (48) and simply change the subscripts
properly. In addition, from |K13 −K14| ≤1−K34 and |K23 +K24| ≤1+K34 it follows that
|K13 −K14 +K23 +K24| ≤|K13 −K14|+|K23 +K24| ≤2 ,
(54)
which is one of the Bell-CHSH inequalities [93, 95]. The other forms of Bell-CHSH inequalities follow by inter-
changing subscripts. Therefore, the existence of the quadrivariate 0 ≤f(x1,x2,x3,x4) ≤1 implies that all Bell-type
inequalities hold.
Let us assume that four EPRB experiments yield discrete data which, to good approximation, can be described by
the frequencies f(x1,x3) = (1+K1 x1 +K3 x3 +K13 x1x3)/4, f(x1,x4) = (1+K1 x1 +K4 x4 +K14 x1x4)/4, f(x2,x3) =
(1+K2 x2 +K3 x3 +K23 x2x4)/4, and f(x2,x4) = (1+K2 x2 +K4 x4 +K24 x2x4)/4, and that all Bell-CHSH inequalities
such Eq. (54) hold. Note that these four frequencies are nonnegative, normalized, pairwise compatible bivariates of
their respective arguments. Therefore, Theorem I applies to each of them, implying that their moments satisfy the
inequalities Eqs. (42) and (43) (with appropriate changes of subscripts).
The mathematical problem we now pose ourselves is under which conditions there exists a nonnegative, nor-
malized function ef(x1,x2,x3,x4) with moments K1, K2, K3, K4, K13, K14, K23, and K24. If we can ﬁnd/construct
ef(x1,x2,x3,x4), we have succeeded to describe the outcomes of the four EPRB experiments with different contexts/-
conditions by one joint distribution, which can then be used to construct a probabilistic model with a common KPS.
As an intermediate step, we prove that given the four, pair-wise compatible bivariates f(x1,x3), f(x1,x4), f(x2,x3),
and f(x2,x4) and the assumption that Eq. (54) hold, there exist two compatible trivariates f2(x1,x3,x4) and f1(x2,x3,x4)
with moments K1, K3, K4, K13, K14, K34, and K2, K3, K4, K23, K24, K34, respectively. Except for K34, all moments are
already known, derivable from the four, pair-wise compatible bivariates. From the data of the four EPRB experiments,
we cannot infer the value of K34.
Therefore, the existence of f2(x1,x3,x4) and f1(x2,x3,x4) depends on whether is possible to assign a value to
K34 in the interval [−1,1] such that f2(x1,x3,x4) and f1(x2,x3,x4) are nonnegative, normalized trivariates. Lemma I
(see Appendix J) shows that there exists such a value of the moment −1 ≤K34 ≤1 if there exist four nonnegative,
normalized, pair-wise compatible bivariates f(x1,x3), f(x1,x4), f(x2,x3), and f(x2,x4) and if Eq. (54) holds. Further-
more, the moments K1, K3, K4, K13, K14, and K34 satisfy the inequalities Eqs. (48a)–(48c) (with appropriate change of
subscripts). From Theorem II and Eq. (50) it then follows that we can always ﬁnd at least one value of K134 such that
there exists a nonnegative, normalized trivariate f2(x1,x3,x4) with these moments. Similarly, K2, K3, K4, K23, K24,
and K34 satisfy the inequalities Eqs. (48a)–(48c) (with appropriate change of subscripts), implying that there exists a
nonnegative, normalized trivariate f1(x2,x3,x4) with these moments.
Following Fine [33], we use these compatible trivariates f2(x1,x3,x4) and f1(x2,x3,x4) to deﬁne the quadrivariate

As 0 ≤f2(x1,x3,x4) ≤∑x1=±1 f2(x1,x3,x4) and 0 ≤f1(x2,x3,x4) ≤∑x1=±1 f2(x1,x3,x4) imply that f2(x1,x3,x4)×

as required. The expression of the second moment −1 ≤eK12 ≤1 in terms of the other ﬁrst and second moments is
rather lengthy and therefore not given here. By construction, the eK’s (with proper combination of subscripts) satisfy
the inequalities Eqs. (48a)–(48c), which include the Bell inequalities. Conversely, if (K1, K3, K4, K13, K14, K34) and
(K2, K3, K4, K23, K24, K34) satisfy the inequalities Eqs. (48a)–(48c), we can construct a normalized, nonnegative
quadrivariate with these moments.
11.4.4. Discussion
From the foregoing, it is abundantly clear that in contrast to Bell’s original derivation, the derivation of Bell-
type inequalities in the probabilistic setting does not rely on assumptions about “locality”, “macroscopic realism”,
“non-invasive measurements” and the like. Violations of Bell-type inequalities derived within the framework of a
probabilistic model are a signature of the non-existence of a joint distribution rather than some signature of “quantum
physics”.
Most importantly, describing two-valued data of EPRB experiments performed under four different conditions
in terms of a joint distribution (if it exists) accomplishes exactly the opposite of the description in separated parts
provided by quantum theory, see the text in boldface in Section 11.4.
11.5. Stochastic hidden-variables model for the data collected in EPRB laboratory experiments
The fundamental problem with applying Bell’s model Eq. (35) to the description of experimental data is the
following. Evidently, in any laboratory EPRB experiment, before one can even think about computing correlations
of particle properties, it is necessary to ﬁrst classify a detection event as corresponding to the arrival of a particle or
as something else. Such a procedure is missing in both the EPRB thought experiment and Bell’s model Eq. (35).
If the aim is to describe the data of an EPRB laboratory experiment, it is necessary to generalize Bell’s model, for
instance by incorporating such an identiﬁcation procedure. To the best of our knowledge, such a generalization was
ﬁrst studied in Refs. [117, 118].
As illustrated in Fig. 3 and further explained in Section 9, for any particular choice of settings, the raw data
produced by EPRB experiments comes in pairs {(xm,tm)|m = 1,...,M} and {(yn,t′
n)|n = 1,...,N} where, in practice,
the numbers of detected events M and N are unlikely to be same. In most EPRB experiments, the t’s represent time
tags, times at which the corresponding detectors ﬁred. More recent experiments [41, 42] employ so-called event-ready
detection techniques, in which case the t’s represent voltage pulses. In this case, the detection of a single photon is
deﬁned as the voltage exceeding a voltage threshold, tuned to maximize the violation [41, 42] of the Clauser-Horn
(CH) inequality [95]. These experiments have demonstrated a violation of the latter but, unlike for the experiments
discussed in Section (9), did not show results as a function of the rotation angles. Conceptually and mathematically,
the voltage threshold is just another mechanism to identify pairs by rejecting events [119]. As the model presented in
this section can be tailored to these experiments by a minor modiﬁcation [119], we focus on building a probabilistic
model for the EPRB experiment with polarized photons depicted in Fig. 3 and discussed in Section 9. A more general
treatment can be found elsewhere [113].
We idealize matters a little by assuming that N = M. Then, the data set looks like E = {(xn,tn,yn,t′
n)|n = 1,...,N}.
As before, for simplicity, for polarized photons we use the angles a and c instead of a and c, respectively. Our goal is
to construct the simplest probabilistic model which
1. describes the compound event (xn,tn,yn,t′
n) in terms of processes that are local to station 1 and 2,
2. yields Malus’ law (by construction),
33

3. yields the averages and the correlation of two spin-1/2 objects in the singlet state,
4. describes the dependence of the correlation on the time-coincidence window W, observed experimentally (see
Section 9),
5. yields the averages and the correlation that are obtained from the quantum-theoretical description of two spin-
1/2 objects in the product state.
For simplicity and in concert with features of the raw data listed in Section 4, we assume that (xm,ym,tm,t′
m) and
(xn,yn,tn,t′
n) are uncorrelated for all m ̸= n. Then the probability for the (xn,yn,tn,t′
n) does not depend on the subscript
n, which we omit in what follows.
Without infringing on the axioms of probability theory and without loss of generality, the probability P(x,y,t,t′|a,b)
can always be expressed as an integral over ξ, ζ, representing the polarization of the photons arriving in stations 1
and 2, respectively. We have
P(x,y,t,t′|a,c) =
1
4π2
Z 2π
0
Z 2π
0
P(x,y,t,t′|a,c,ξ,ζ)p(ξ,ζ|a,c)dξdζ .
(57)
where p(ξ,ζ|a,c) denotes the probability density with which the source emits photons with polarizations (ξ,ζ) under
the conditions (a,c).
With our eye on constructing a model having the same features as those used by Bell to prove his theorem, that is
independence/separability, we assume that (i) the values of x, y, t, and t′ are mutually independent, (ii) the values of x
and t (y and t′) are independent of c and ζ (a and ξ), (iii) ξ and ζ are independent of a or c. With these assumptions
Eq. (57) becomes [113]
P(x,y,t,t′|a,c)
=
1
4π2
Z 2π
0
Z 2π
0
P(x|a,ξ)P(t|a,ξ)P(y|c,ζ)P(t′|c,ζ)p(ξ,ζ)dξdζ .
(58)
Note that xy-correlation calculated using Eq. (58) has the same mathematical structure as Eq. (37) and therefore,
according to Bell’s theorem, this correlation can never be arbitrarily close to −cos2(a−c) for all a and c.
However, EPRB experiments [26, 88–90] employing a time-coincidence window W to identify pairs of photons
are not described by Eq. (58). Accounting for the time-coincidences requires that we multiply Eq. (58) by the unit-step
function Θ(W −|t −t′|) and integrate over all possible t and t′. Therefore, the data used to compute the correlations
are described by the probability
P(x,y|a,c) =
Z 2π
0
Z 2π
0
P(x|a,ξ)P(y|c,ζ)bµ(ξ,ζ|a,c)dξdζ ,
(59)
where
bµ(ξ,ζ|a,c) =
w(ξ,ζ|a,c)p(ξ,ζ)
R 2π
0
R 2π
0
w(ξ ′,ζ ′|a,c)p(ξ ′,ζ ′)dξ ′dζ ′ ,
(60)
and the weight w(ξ,ζ|a,c) is given by
w(ξ,ζ|a,c)
=
Z +∞
−∞
Z +∞
−∞Θ(W −|t −t′|)P(t|a,ξ)P(t′|c,ζ)dt dt′ .
(61)
Equation (59) no longer has the structure of Bell’s model because the probability density Eq. (60) may depend on
(a,c) (violating the notion of separability). In other words, Bell’s theorem does not apply to the probabilistic model
deﬁned by Eq. (59).
In order to proceed, we have to make a choice for the distribution of time delays. As a very simply choice we take
P(t|a,ξ) = Θ(t)Θ(T(ξ −a)−t)/T(ξ −a), where T is a function speciﬁed below, and obtain
w(ξ,ζ|a,c)
=
1
T(ξ −a)T(ζ −c)
Z T(ξ−a)
0
dt
Z T(ζ−c)
0
Θ(W −|t −t′|)dt dt′ .
(62)
34

With this deﬁnition of P(t|a,ξ), the integrals in Eq. (62) can be worked out analytically [113]. Inspired by the results
of event-by-event simulations [107, 108, 113], we set T(ξ −a) = T0|sin2(ξ −a)|d/2 where T0 and d are parameters
of the model. As the full expression is not of immediate interest, we only give the expressions for a few interesting
limiting cases [113]:

.
(63)
Let us ﬁrst demonstrate how Eqs. (59) and (62) yield the correct quantum-theoretical expression for two spin-1/2
objects in a product state. Assume that p(ξ,ζ) = δ(ξ −α)δ(ζ −β). Then, independent of the distributions of t and
t′, we ﬁnd
P(x,y|a,c) = P(x|a,α)P(y|c,β) ,
(64)
which has the structure of the probability for a quantum system in product state, see Appendix M.2. Furthermore,
independent of the choice of p(ξ,ζ), we also recover Eq. (64) if Eq. (63) does not dependent on ξ or ζ. Thus, as
the ﬁrst two rows of Eq. (63) show, we also recover Eq. (64) if W is larger than the maximum time delay T0 or if the
parameter d = 0.
Next, we demonstrate that Eqs. (59) and (62) yield the quantum-theoretical expressions for the averages and the
correlation of two photon-polarizations in the singlet state. We start by assuming that the source emits pairs of photons
with orthogonal polarizations, in symbols p(ξ,ζ) = δ(ξ +π/2−ζ).
For small W/T0, we use the expression in the third row of Eq. (63) and insert the expressions P(x|a,ξ) =
(1 + xcos2(ξ −a))/2 and P(y|c,ζ) = (1 + ycos2(ζ −c))/2 known from Malus’ law. By symmetry, it follows im-
mediately that E1(a,c,W →0) = E2(a,c,W →0) = 0. For even integer values of d, the expression of the correlation
E12(a,c,W →0) can be obtained analytically. We ﬁnd [113]
E12(a,c,W →0)

(65)
where θ = a −c. Clearly, for d = 4 and W →0, the probabilistic model yields the desired correlation bE12(a,c) =
−cos2(a−c) for two photon polarizations described by the singlet state. For d > 4, the resulting correlation is outside
the scope of what a quantum-theoretical model of two spin-1/2 objects can describe because it violates the Cirel’son
bound [98], see Eq. (M.11).
Repeating the calculation with parallel instead of antiparallel polarizations, that is with p(ξ,ζ) = δ(ξ −ζ), simply
changes the sign of E(a,b,W →0) in Eq. (65). The resulting correlation is outside the scope of what a quantum-
theoretical model of two spin-1/2 objects can describe, (because q < −1/3, see Section 8.2).
In conclusion, the probabilistic model for the raw data produced by EPRB experiments, in combination with time
coincidence counting employed in most of these experiments, does indeed (for W →0 and d = 4) yield the averages
and the correlation of two spins-1/2 objects in the singlet state, complies with Malus’ law and can (if d = 0 or W ≥T0)
also describe two spins-1/2 objects in the product state.
EPRB experiments that do not rely on coincidence counting but identify photons by a process that is local to the
observation station [41, 42] can be treated similarly [119]. We only have to replace Eq. (62) by
w(ξ,ζ|a,c) = w(ξ|a)w(ζ|c) ,

11.6. Subquantum model: event-by-event simulation
In this section, we brieﬂy discuss results obtained by event-by-event simulations that comply with the operational
deﬁnition of an NQM, as given in the beginning of this section. In the appropriate limits, event-by-event simulation
can reproduce, to very good approximation, all results of the quantum theory for two spins-1/2 objects [2, 97, 107,
108, 113]. As there are abundant publications about this simulation work, we refrain from describing the algorithm
and refer the interested reader to these publications.
Unlike real experiments, an event-by-event CM of the EPRB experiment can operate in a mode in which all the
data in D1, D2, D3, and D4 can be extracted from quadruples [2]. Computationally, this feat is realized by using the
same pseudo-random numbers for each of the four different experiments [2]. In this case, the process that generates
the data is said to comply with the notion of counterfactual deﬁniteness [120].
In the counterfactual deﬁnite mode of simulation, the four sets of data originate from one set of quadruples, and
therefore we have ∆= 1. It then follows from Eq. (9) that SCHSH ≤2. Clearly, the counterfactual deﬁnite mode
of simulation can never generate data that leads to a violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. Consequently, Bell’s
theorem guarantees that the counterfactual deﬁnite mode of simulation can never yield a correlation that closely
resembles E12 = −a·c.
Generating raw data E = {(x1,t1,y1,t′
1),...,(xN,tN,xN,t′
N)} with the perfect, counterfactual deﬁnite mode of sim-
ulation yielding a correlation that closely resembles E12 = −a · c can only be accomplished by discarding raw data
depending on the conditions a and c. Then the new data sets D′
1, D′
2, D′
3, and D′
4 no longer have the property that all
contribution to the correlations can be reshufﬂed to form quadruples.

Averages and correlation
a-c (degrees)
Figure 9: (color online) The averages and correlations as obtained by an event-by-event simulation of an EPRB laboratory experiment in which the
detection of a photon in a station 1 or 2 depends on a threshold that is local to the respective stations [41, 42]. There is no coincidence counting in
this set up. Solid line: the correlation E12(a,c) = −cos2(a−c), as obtained from LI applied to a reproducible and robust experiment (see Section 7)
and from the quantum theory of two spins-1/2 objects in the singlet state; dotted line: the correlation E12(a,c) = −1+(2/π)arccos(cos2(a−c))
as obtained from Bell’s toy model (see Appendix L.1); solid squares: the correlation E(12)

(see Eq. (2)) computed from the data generated by the
event-by-event simulation; open triangles: the averages (see Eq. (2)) E(1)

(△) and E(2)

(▽) computed from the data generated by the event-by-
event simulation; open circles: the correlation E(12)

computed from the data generated by the event-by-event simulation without accounting for the
local thresholds. In the latter case, the simulation data is in excellent agreement with the correlation obtained from Bell’s modiﬁed toy model (see
Section Appendix L.2). Using a threshold mechanism similar to the one employed in the so-called loophole free EPRB experiments [41, 42], there
is excellent agreement between the simulation data (solid squares and triangles) obtained with the quantum-theoretical description of the EPRB
experiment.
Figure 9 shows the results of an event-by-event simulation of EPRB laboratory experiments with photons in
36

which data is discarded, not by coincidence counting, but by a local procedure mimicking the one used in the analysis
of EPRB laboratory experiments [41, 42], a procedure similar to the one described by Eq. (66). For the complete
speciﬁcation of the simulation algorithm the reader should consult Ref. [97].
Figure 9 demonstrates that the correlation (solid squares) and averages (triangles) obtained by the event-by-event
simulation are in excellent agreement with the corresponding quantum-theoretical results. Also shown by the open
circles is the correlation obtained without discarding raw data. This correlation matches the one obtained from Bell’s
modiﬁed toy model, see Appendix L.2. For reference, the dashed line shows the correlation obtained from Bell’s toy
model, see Appendix L.1.
In summary, the counterfactual deﬁnite mode of simulation can only generate raw data for the A’s, and B’s which
can be extracted from quadruples. Therefore, the correlation computed with this data can never violate the Bell-
CHSH inequality and, by appeal to Bell’s theorem, can never closely resemble E12 = −cos2(a −c). In complete
agreement with model-free inequality Eq. (6), there is only one way out of the conundrum, namely one has to discard,
with whatever procedure, data. Bell’s model Eq. (35) is too primitive. It does not contain such a procedure. On the
other hand, all EPRB laboratory experiments (including the so-called loophole free experiments [40–42]), one way
or another, never use all the raw data to check for violations of Bell-type inequalities but have their ways to identify
a fraction of them as photons. It is this selection process that can give rise to the violation of a Bell-type inequality
(beyond the usual statistical ﬂuctuations) and, in some cases such as the one discussed in the present and the previous
section, yields a correlation that resembles E12 = −cos2(a−c).
12. Conclusion
The view taken in this paper is that discrete data recorded by experiments and mathematical models envisaged
to describe relevant features (e.g., averages, correlations, etc.) of these data belong in their own, separate universes
and should be treated accordingly. Using EPRB experiments as an example, we have scrutinized various aspects of
treating discrete data and mathematical models thereof separately.
In the universe of discrete data, the number of operations one can carry out on the data without changing the
numerical values of the relevant features is very limited. In fact, we can only resort to the commutativity of the
addition operation to reshufﬂe the order in which the contributions to a sum appear. In this paper, we demonstrate
that this property sufﬁces to prove new nontrivial bounds on the value of certain linear combinations (e.g., as they
appear in the Bell-CHSH inequality) of correlations. Being the result of elementary arithmetic, that is being the result
of multiplying and adding numbers which take values plus and minus one only, these nontrivial bounds cannot be
violated by data obtained from EPRB experiments.
Most importantly, the proof of these nontrivial bounds does not require making assumptions about the process that
produced the data. They are “model-free”, linear functions of the number of quadruples one can create by reordering
the contributions to each of the correlations. If the number of quadruples is equal to the number of contributions
to the correlations, the values of these nontrivial bounds coincide with the values known from the Bell, CHSH, or
CH inequalities. However, the latter have been derived in the context of a mathematical (Bell-type) model, not in
the context of experimental data. The model-free Bell-type bounds for discrete data, a special case of the general
model-free inequality, may be violated. However, this violation has no bearing on the validity of the assumptions that
may have provided the motivation to construct the mathematical (Bell-type) model.
The existence of the divide between the universes of discrete data and mathematical models thereof is further
supported by Fine’s theorem for a probabilistic model of the EPRB experiment. Of particular relevance to the present
discussion is the part of the theorem that establishes the Bell-CHSH inequalities (plus compatibility) as being the
necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the existence of a joint distribution of the four observables involved in these
inequalities. This four-variable joint distribution returns the pair distributions describing the four EPRB experiments
required to test for a violation of these inequalities. Fine’s theorem holds in the mathematical-model universe only.
Only in the unattainable limit of an inﬁnite number of measurements (that is by leaving the universe of discrete data),
and in the special case that the Bell-CHSH inequalities hold, it may be possible to prove the mathematical equivalence
between the model-free and Bell-type bounds.
Having established that the discrete-data and mathematical-model universes are separate entities, a major question
is how to establish the applicability and validity of a particular mathematical model. In the case that the results of
37

individual measurements are assumed to be unpredictable, as in EPRB experiments, the comparison is through the
averages, correlations, etc., predicted by the mathematical model with those of the experimental data.
Starting from discrete data, we have demonstrated that the construction of a mathematical model giving a concise
description of the averages and correlations computed from these data yields the quantum-theoretical model of the
EPRB thought experiment. Essential ingredients of this construction are separation of conditions and the assumptions
that the relevant features are reproducible and change smoothly with smooth variations (robustness) of the conditions
under which the experiments are carried out.
In contrast to the conventional approach which postulates that quantum theory models the process by which
experiments produce data, the constructive approach adopted in this paper is free of all issues created by attempts
to attach an interpretation to the symbols appearing in the mathematical model and to “explain” that each laboratory
measurement yields a deﬁnite result.
Our construction shows that the quantum model of the EPRB experiments is just one particular description of the
relevant features of the discrete data. We have argued that compared to other representations of data obtained from
EPRB experiments, quantum theory is exceptionally powerful in that it can represent the relevant features of the data
of EPRB thought experiments with many different settings in terms of only ﬁfteen numbers.
In summary, we have shown that by starting from the discrete data produced by EPRB experiments, all controver-
sies about the meaning of the violation of Bell-type inequalities evaporate and that the quantum-theoretical model of
the EPRB experiments emerges (not by postulate) as a very powerful description of the data.
In conclusion, there seem to be two non-compatible alternatives to model physical phenomena:
• In the data-driven approach, the experimental data are considered to be immutable facts. The ﬁrst step is to
analyze the data without committing to a particular mathematical model for the process that is imagined to have
created the data. The second step is to construct, not postulate, mathematical models which provide a concise,
accurate picture of how the relevant features of the data change as the conditions under which the experiments
have been performed change. Being data-driven, the applicability of the mathematical model is measured by
the degree by which the model prediction ﬁts (not produces) the data. The quantum-theoretical description
emerges as a powerful, compact, separated, interpretation-free model of the data generated by EPRB thought
experiments.
Alternatively, one can develop event-based computer models that are capable of mimicking the processes that
give rise to the experimental data. Essential for the success of this step is that the model accounts for all
processes, including the data processing part, that are critical for the experiment to succeed. There is no obstacle
for constructing probabilistic models and computer models for EPRB laboratory experiments which produce
data to which the quantum-theoretical description of EPRB thought experiments ﬁts very well.
• In the theory-driven approach, it is (often implicitly) assumed that the production of experimental data is gov-
erned by a (possibly yet to be discovered) pre-existing mathematical model. Starting from a set of axioms, this
approach proves theorems about these mathematical models and by assumption, also about the phenomena that
we experience with our senses. In the case of the EPRB experiment, the failure of Bell’s model to describe
the experimental data is regarded as a proof that one or more of the assumptions (e.g., locality, etc.) underly-
ing the model do not hold in the universe that we experience with our senses. This failure has given birth to
notions such as “spooky action on a distance”, “nonlocality”, etc., injecting new elements to the already vast
universe of interpretations of quantum theory. The theory-driven approach leads to endless discussions about
the interpretation of the mathematical symbols used.
If one is mainly interested in modeling natural phenomena, the data-driven approach has some outstanding merits.
If one is mainly interested in discussing “interpretations”, the theory-driven approach is the method of choice. The
choice between these two alternatives depends on one’s world view and interests. Summarizing the above discussion
of the two non-compatible alternatives to model physical phenomena, one should exert extreme caution when switch-
ing between these two alternatives and, in the authors’ opinion, failing to do so is what plagues the interpretation of
the results of EPRB experiments.

Appendix A. Pairs, triples, quadruples, and octuples
In mathematics, an n-tuple is an ordered list of n elements, denoted by (A,B,...). In this paper we call (A,B) a
pair, implicitly assuming it is ordered, a 2-tuple. Similarly, the lists (A,B,C) and (A,B,C,D) are referred to as a triple
(3-tuple) or quadruple (4-tuple), and an ordered list of 8 elements is an octuple.
Appendix B. Proof of the model-free inequality for correlations of discrete data
The inequality derived in this section applies to any experiment that produces discrete data, which without loss of
generality, can always be thought of as being rescaled to lie in the interval [−1,+1]. If the data were real-valued, it is
no longer possible to uniquely identify the quadruples which are essential for the proof of the inequality. We derive
a bound on a certain combination of correlations, each one computed from data gathered under different conditions.
The nth data item obtained under condition x is denoted by Ax,n for n = 1,...,N where |Ax,n| ≤1. Recall that the
subscript x labels the condition only and does not, in any way, implicitly imply a dependence of Ax,n on x in terms of
a MM. As before, the symbols A and B represent discrete data.
Inspiration to derive the model-free inequality stems from the standard procedure of demonstrating a violation
of a Bell-CHSH inequality. The latter consists of performing EPRB laboratory experiments with four different pairs
of settings (a,c), (a,d), (b,c) and (b,d). As mentioned earlier, all EPRB laboratory experiments use, e.g. time-
coincidence, local time windows, voltage thresholds, etc. to identify pairs. This results in a further, often substantial
reduction of the number of pairs. Furthermore, in practice, the number of observed pairs may depend on the setting.
However, data sets can always be truncated such that the number of pairs of the four sets is the same. Thus, an
EPRB laboratory experiment, with or without some post-processing of the data, produces discrete data A1,n, etc., for
n = 1,...,N in four independent runs of length N. The procedure of how this data was obtained is irrelevant for the
derivation of the inequality presented in this section.
The data sets obtained for four different conditions denoted by 1, 2, 3 and 4 read
D1
=
{(A1,n,B1,n)||A1,n| ≤1,|B1,n| ≤1; n = 1,...,N} ,
(B.1a)

where N is the number of pairs. From the discrete data Eq. (B.1), we compute the correlations

To simplify the notation somewhat, in this and all other appendices, we use the symbols Cs instead of E(12)
s
for
s = 1,2,3,4 to denote correlations.
In general, each contribution to the correlations Eq. (B.2) may take any value in the interval [−1,+1], independent
of the values taken by other contributions, yielding the trivial bound
|C1 ∓C2|+|C3 ±C4|
≤
4 .
(B.3)
Without introducing a speciﬁc model for the process that generates the data, we can derive a bound that is sharper
than Eq. (B.3) by making use of Eq. (N.5). To this end, we ﬁrst identify the contributions to C1, C2, C3 and C4 which,
after suitable reshufﬂing of the terms, can be brought in the form xz∓xw+yz±yw to which Eq. (N.5) applies.
Unfortunately, writing down the idea of suitable reshufﬂing in mathematical notation requires a cumbersome
notation, possibly giving the wrong impression that the proof that follows is complicated. The reader who is not
interested in the technicalities of the proof should nevertheless read the next paragraph to understand what is meant
by “quadruples” and can then jump to the ﬁnal result Eq. (B.9).
We introduce permutations P(.), bP(.), eP(.), and P′(.) of the ﬁrst N integers and rewrite Eq. (B.2) as
C1 = 1
N
N
∑
n=1
A1,P(n)B1,P(n) , C2 = 1

A3,eP(n)B3,eP(n) , C4 = 1
N
N
∑
n=1
A4,P′(n)B4,P′(n) . (B.4)
Obviously, reordering the terms of the sums does not change the value of the sums themselves. Suppose that we can
ﬁnd permutations P(.), bP(.), eP(.), and P′(.) such that
x = A1,P(1) = A2,bP(1) , y = A3,eP(1) = A4,P′(1) , z = B1,P(1) = B3,eP(1) , w = B2,bP(1) = B4,P′(1) ,
(B.5)
showing that the variables of the octuple (A1,P(1),A2,bP(1),A3,eP(1),A4,P′(1),B1,P(1),B3,eP(1),B2,bP(1),B4,P′(1)) form the quadru-
ple (x,y,z,w), deﬁned by Eq. (B.5). In other words, if we can ﬁnd P(.), bP(.), eP(.), and P′(.) such that Eq. (B.5) holds,
the original data in terms of octuples exhibits structure that allows at least that one octuple to be reduced to a quadruple.
From Eq. (B.5), it is clear that by deﬁnition, the permutations always interchange pairs of data (As,n,Bs,n) within
a particular data set s = 1,2,3,4, that is the mapping is of the kind (As,n,Bs,n) →(As,n′,Bs,n′), replacing n by n′ for
both the A and B simultaneously, for the same value of s. There is no reshufﬂing of the items within pairs, as would
be the case in for instance (As,n,Bs,n) →(As,n′,Bs,n′′) with n′ ̸= n′′. This is important because if the data pairs have
been selected through a time-coincidence (see Fig. 3) or any other procedure, application of these permutations does
not affect the pairing of events within one particular data set. In other words, the permutations would never mix up
the time tags of data pairs.
Using the triangle inequality and Eq. (N.5b), we have
|C1 ∓C2|+|C3 ±C4| ≤

(B.6)
From Eq. (B.6) the importance of identifying quadruples is clear. For every quadruple which we can create by
reshufﬂing data pairs, the contribution to the expression on the left hand side of Eq. (B.6) is limited in magnitude by
two, not by four.
Now assume that we can ﬁnd permutations Q(.), bQ(.), eQ(.), and Q′(.) such that for k = 1,...,Kmax,
xk = A1,Q(k) = A2, bQ(k) , yk = A3, eQ(k) = A4,Q′(k) , zk = B1,Q(k) = B3, eQ(k) , wk = B2, bQ(k) = B4,Q′(k) ,
(B.7)
40

where Kmax ≤N denotes the largest integer for which we can ﬁnd these four permutations, that is Kmax is the maximum
number of pairs in each data set that form quadruples. If it is not possible to ﬁnd any such quadruple, we have Kmax = 0
by deﬁnition.
The choice represented by Eq. (B.7) is motivated by the EPRB experiment, see Fig. 2. In general, other choices
to deﬁne quadruples are possible and may yield different values of the maximum fraction of quadruples. However, if
max(|C1 −C2|+|C3 +C4|,|C1 +C2|+|C3 −C4) = 4−2∆(possibly up to some statistical ﬂuctuations), as is the case
in some of the numerical examples discussed below, we may be conﬁdent that the choice Eq. (B.7) yields the largest
value of ∆that can be obtained by reshufﬂing of the data.
Repeating the steps the yielded Eq. (B.6) Kmax times, we ﬁnd
|C1 ∓C2|+|C3 ±C4| ≤2Kmax

(B.8)
where 0 ≤∆= Kmax/N ≤1 is the ratio of the maximum number of quadruples Kmax to the number of pairs N, a
measure for the “hidden” structure in the collection of octuples.
In summary, we have proven that independent of the origin of the four sets of discrete data Eq. (B.1), the correla-
tions computed from these data sets must satisfy the “model-free” inequality
|C1 −C2|+|C3 +C4| ≤4−2∆
,
|C1 +C2|+|C3 −C4| ≤4−2∆,
(B.9)
where ∆= Kmax/N is the fraction of maximum number of quadruples one can ﬁnd by reshufﬂing the original data set
of octuples. Appealing to the triangle inequality once more, it follows from Eq. (B.9) that
SCHSH =
max
(i,j,k,l)∈πππ4
Ci −Cj +Ck +Cl

≤
4−2∆,
(B.10)
where πππn denotes the set of all permutations of (1,...,n) and SCHSH denotes the Bell-CHSH function.
The same procedure can be used to derive inequalities for the correlations computed from three instead of four
data sets. Alternatively, following Bell [93], we can obtain these inequalities by replacing C4 in Eq. (B.9) by one and
we have
|C1 +C2| ≤3−2∆+C3
,
|C1 −C2| ≤3−2∆−C3 .
(B.11)
From Eq. (N.6) it then follows that
Ci ±Cj
 ≤3−2∆±Ck for all (i, j,k) ∈πππ3, are the appropriate, model-free “Bell
inequalities” for discrete data.
Inequalities Eqs. (B.9–(B.11) cannot be violated by data of a (real or thought) EPRB experiment, unless the
mathematical apparatus that we use is inconsistent (a possibility which we do not consider). For example, assume that
an EPRB laboratory experiment yields data for which SCHSH > 2, that is the data violate the Bell-CHSH inequality.
Then we can use Eq. (B.9) to ﬁnd that ∆≤2−SCHSH/2, implying that the number of quadruples in the sets Eq. (B.1)
does not exceed (2−SCHSH/2)N. On the basis of the experimental data only, this is all one can say with certainty.
41

It should be noted that we have not proven that all the octuples in the sets Eq. (1) can be reshufﬂed to form
quadruples if the correlations satisfy |C1 ∓C2|+|C3 ±C4| < 2. In fact, it is easy to construct simple counterexamples.
For instance, if D1 = {(+1,−1),(+1,+1)}, D2 = {(−1,−1),(−1,+1)}, D3 = {(−1,−1),(+1,−1)}, and D4 =
{(+1,+1),(−1,−1)}, then C1 = C2 = C3 = 0 and C4 = 1, yet it is impossible to reshufﬂe the data such that they can
be extracted from two quadruples. If we assume that the averages of A1 and A2, A3 and A4, B1 and B3, B2 and B4 are
the same and |C1 ∓C2|+|C3 ±C4| < 2, our numerical experiments suggest that almost all of them can be reshufﬂed
to create quadruples (see examples below). This observation in the realm of data can be understood in terms of Fine’s
theorem [47], see also Section 11.4.
We emphasize that inequalities Eqs. (B.9–(B.11) do not depend on how the data was generated and/or processed
and hold in general, independent of (any model for) the process that generates the data.
Appendix B.1. The Eberhard inequality for discrete data
The EPRB experiments reported in Refs. [34, 35] have only one detector in each of the two stations (see Fig. 2).
To account for the photons that have been detected and would have been detected by the missing detectors and also
to account for undetected photons, the events are classiﬁed in two groups. Adopting the notation used in Refs. [34,
35], the events that are recorded by the detector and all other events are given the label “+” and “0”, respectively. If
desired, the averages and the correlations can be calculated as usual (see Eq. (2)) by assigning the values x,y = +1 to
the former and x,y = −1 to the latter class of events. Of course, the correlation obtained from these experiments may
be different from those used to compute the correlations appearing in inequalities Eqs. (B.9)–(B.11).
In the EPRB experiments reported in Refs. [34, 35], the number of interest is the combination of counts [121]
EBERdata

.
(B.12)
The rationale for considering EBERdata is that if the data is generated in the form of quadruples or for instance, by a
CM of a Bell-type (counterfactual deﬁnite) model, we have EBERdata ≤0.
We derive the appropriate, model-free upper bound to EBERdata by proceeding in a manner analogous to the
one used to derive inequalities Eqs. (B.9)–(B.11). First, we introduce two-valued, integer variables Xs,n and Ys,n to
represent the detection of an event at stations 1 and 2, respectively. As before, the subscript s = 1,2,3,4 refers to the
data sets obtained under the conditions (a,c), (a,d), (b,c), and (b,d), respectively. If station 1(2) reports a “+” event
for the n-th pair, we set Xs,n = 1 (Ys,n = 1). Otherwise, we set Xs,n = 0 (Ys,n = 0). In terms of these variables we have
EBERdata
=
N
∑
n=1
[X1,nY1,n −X2,n(1−Y2,n)−(1−X3,n)Y3,n −X4,nY4,n] .
(B.13)
If X1,n = X2,n, X3,n = X4,n, Y1,n = Y3,n and Y2,n = Y4,n, as it would be if these data were generated in the form of a
quadruple or by a CM of an LHVM, simply enumerating all sixteen possibilities shows that −1 ≤X1,nY1,n −X2,n(1−
Y2,n)−(1−X3,n)Y3,n −X4,nY4,n ≤0. In general, we have −3 ≤X1,iY1,i′ −X2,j(1−Y2,j′)−(1−X3,k)Y3,k′ −X4,lY4,l′ ≤1.
Next, as before, we assume that there exist permutations Q(.), bQ(.), eQ(.), and Q′(.) such that for all k = 1,...,Kmax,
X1,Q(k) = X2, bQ(k) , X3, eQ(k) = X4,Q′(k) , Y1,Q(k) = Y3, eQ(k) , Y2, bQ(k) = Y4,Q′(k) .
(B.14)
If we can ﬁnd these four permutations, we have identiﬁed Kmax pairs in each data set that can be represented by Kmax
quadruples. If it is not possible to ﬁnd any such quadruple, we have Kmax = 0 by deﬁnition. Note that the permutations
Q(.), bQ(.), eQ(.), and Q′(.) and the value of Kmax are not necessarily the same as in case where the involved data has
been obtained by analyzing the data of EPRB experiments with two detectors per station.
Writing Eq. (B.13) as
EBERdata

Kmax
∑
k=1
h
X1,Q(k)Y1,Q(k) −X2, bQ(1−Y2, bQ(k))−(1−X3, eQ(k))Y3, bQ(k) −X4,Q′(k)Y4,Q′(k)

i
, (B.15)
42

and using the respective lower and upper bounds for each of the terms in the sums we obtain
−3(N −Kmax)−Kmax ≤EBERdata ≤N −Kmax ,
(B.16)
or, expressed in terms of the fraction of quadruples,
−3+2∆≤EBERdata
N
≤1−∆,
(B.17)
where the value of ∆is not necessarily the same as the value of ∆obtained by analyzing the data of EPRB experiments
with two detectors per station. This is because the data of the X’s and Y’s obtained by performing EPRB experiments
with one detector per station are not the same as the data of the A’s and B’s obtained by performing EPRB experiments
with two detectors per station. If all the data pairs that contribute to N++

, N+0
2 , N0+
3
and N++
4
can be reshufﬂed to
form quadruples, we have ∆= 1 and Eq. (B.17) becomes the CH inequality EBERdata/N ≤0 [95] for discrete data.
As an illustration, we take the data reported in the Supplemental material of Ref. [41]. The valid trials for the four
settings are N1 = 875683790, N2 = 875518074, N3 = 875882007, and N4 = 875700279 such that the total number
of counts Ntot = N1 + N2 + N3 + N4 = 3502784150 [41]. After post-processing by adjusting voltage thresholds, the
corresponding photon counts are N++

= 141439, N+0
2
= 67941, N0+
3
= 58742 and N++
4
= 8392 [41].
To estimate ∆from the data provided in Ref. [41], we have to be able to truncate three of the four data sets such
that they have the same number of pairs N. In principle, this requires processing the four full sequences of individual
events. Fortunately, in view of the large number of events, this is not necessary if we proceed as follows. We deﬁne
N = (N1 + N2 + N3 + N4)/4 and compute bN++

the same as the value of J reported in Ref. [41]. From Eq. (B.17) it then follows that ∆≲0.99999273.
In Ref. [41], the tiny number of 7.27×10−6, an order of magnitude smaller than the expected statistical error of
1/
√
N ≈3×10−5, is taken as strong evidence that the data cannot be described by an LHVM of the Bell-type [41, 42].
Moreover, the data was obtained by adjusting voltage thresholds [41, 42], a process that is not accounted for in the
LHVM that is being rejected but is essential to create data such that bN++

> 0. Clearly, for the
reasons explained in Section 6, the logic that leads to this conclusion needs to be revised.
On the basis of the experimental data, the correct conclusion one can draw from ∆≲0.99999273 is that a very
small fraction of all the selected pairs of photon events cannot be rearranged to create quadruples.
Appendix B.2. The Clauser-Horn inequality for discrete data
Given the same data sets, bounds on CHdata, also expressing structure in the data, can be derived as follows.
Consider the expression (or similar expressions with permutations of the subscripts (1,2,3,4))
CHdata(x,y)
=
f1(x,y)−f2(x,y)+ f3(x,y)+ f4(x,y)

z=−1,1
(f1(x,z)−f2(x,z)+ f3(x,z)+ f4(x,z)+ f1(z,y)−f2(z,y)+ f3(z,y)+ f4(z,y)) ,
(B.19)
where x,y = ±1 and the frequencies fs(x,y) for s = 1,2,3,4 are given by Eq. (4). Recall that x,y = 1(−1) correspond
to events of type “+”(“0”). Expressing these frequencies in terms of their moments, that is, using Eq. (5d) yields
CHdata(x,y)

(B.20)
Adopting the notation for the correlations adopted in this, we have
CHdata(x,y)
=
−1
2 + xy
4 (C1 −C2 +C3 +C4) ,
(B.21)
43

and using Eq. (B.10), we obtain
−1−1−∆
2
≤CHdata(x,y) ≤1−∆
2
.
(B.22)
The relation between CHdata(x,y) and the CH inequality becomes clear if we assume that E(1)

E(1)

4 . This assumption complies with the idea of a description in terms of a joint distribution
for EPRB experiments with four different pairs of settings, see Section 11.4, or in terms of Bell’s model Eq. (35).
With this assumption, Eq. (B.22) reduces to
CHdata(x,y)
=
f1(x,y)−f2(x,y)+ f3(x,y)+ f4(x,y)−∑
z=−1,1
(f3(x,z)+ f3(z,y)) .
(B.23)
Assuming that all the data originates from a set of quadruples we have ∆= 1, identifying (1) = (a,c), (2) = (a,d),
(3) = (b,c), and (4) = (b,d) as before, and adopting the notation used by CH, Eq. (B.22) becomes
−1 ≤Pxy(a,c)−Pxy(a,d)+Pxy(b,c)+Pxy(b,d)−Px(b)−Py(c) ≤0 ,
(B.24)
which, for every pair (x,y), is the CH inequality in its usual form [95]. Note that the assumption made to obtain
Eq. (B.24) implies that E(1)
1 , E(1)
3 , E(2)
1 , and E(2)
2
only depend on a, b, c, and d, respectively, justifying writing the
marginals with respect to the variables x and y as Px(b) and Py(c), respectively.
Using Px=+(b) = ∑u=+,−P+u(b,d) and Py=+(c) = ∑u=+,−Pu+(b,c), Eq. (B.24) becomes
−1 ≤P++(a,c)−P++(a,d)−P−+(b,c)−P+−(b,d) ≤0 ,
(B.25)
a violation of the right-hand side of Eq. (B.25) by data being interpreted as the break-down of local realism [41, 42].
In conclusion, as in the case of the Bell-CHSH inequality, also the CH inequalities Eqs. (B.24) and (B.25) are of
little use to draw conclusions from the analysis of discrete data originating from (numerical) experiments, because for
such data, the appropriate inequality is Eq. (B.17) with CHdata given by Eq. (B.12), not inequality Eq. B.25 which has
been derived within the context of a MM which assumes counterfactual deﬁniteness. Being model-free mathematical
facts, inequalities Eqs. (B.17) and B.22 cannot be violated.
Appendix B.3. Lower bounds to the fraction of quadruples
It is easy to derive lower bounds to the fraction of quadruples ∆if all the A’s and B’s that appear in Eq. (B.1) take
values ±1 only. The most naive method to compute such a lower bound ignores the possibility of reshufﬂing the data
such that the correlations remain the same and simply counts the number of times the four conditions
A1,k = A2,k , A3,k = A4,k , B1,k = B3,k , B2,k = B4,k .
(B.26)
are satisﬁed. We denote the faction of quadruples thus obtained by b∆. Obviously, calculating b∆is easy and computa-
tionally inexpensive.
With similar computational effort, we can compute a better lower bound as follows. First we note that
C1 = 1

A1,n = +1 and B1,n = −1, and A1,n = −1 and B1,n = +1, respectively. Expressions similar to Eq. (B.27) hold for
C2, C3, and C4. The number of quadruples that can be formed with all A’s and B’s equal to +1 is given by N++ =

that is e∆is a lower bound to ∆(0 ≤e∆≤∆≤1). Furthermore, it is obvious that b∆≤e∆, where b∆has been obtained by
imposing the condition Eq. (B.26) and e∆is given by Eq. (B.28).
Therefore, we have
SCHSH ≤|C1 ∓C2|+|C3 ±C4| ≤4−2∆≤4−2e∆≤4−2b∆≤4 ,
(B.29)
where the upper bound of four is a mathematical triviality.
Appendix B.4. Computing the maximum number of quadruples
The technicalities of the proof of Eq. (B.9), involving four permutations of N numbers, are of little use when
we actually want to ﬁnd all quadruples in the data sets Eq. (B.1). Indeed, enumerating all (N!)4 possibilities by a
computer quickly becomes prohibitive as N increases (for instance (10!)4 ≈173 × 1024). However, the proof of the
model-free inequality Eq. (B.9) only requires the existence of a maximum number of quadruples, the actual value of
this maximum being irrelevant for the proof.
Nevertheless, it is instructive to write a computer program that uses uniform pseudo-random numbers to generate
the data sets Eq. (B.2) and ﬁnds the number of quadruples. By specifying an algorithm that generates the data, we
have deﬁned a CM. At ﬁrst sight, ﬁnding the value of ∆itself may require O(N!4) arithmetic operations. Fortunately,
the problem of determining the fraction of quadruples ∆can be cast into an integer linear programming problem
which, in the most relevant case for which the A’s and B’s take values ±1 only, seems easy to solve by considering
the associated linear programming problem with real-valued unknowns. In practice, we solve the latter by standard
optimization techniques [122] and then check that the solution takes integer values only, which it always seems to do
(an observation for which we have no proof). In this case, the solution of the linear programming problem is also the
solution of the integer programming problem. We have implemented the computer program in Mathematica®.
Table B.3: Lists of all possible combinations of the pairs of data which form quadruples, written in a slightly different notation to emphasize the
quadruple structure. Given the data sets D2, D3 and D4, the optimization task is to ﬁnd the numbers mi ≥0 for i = 0,...,15 that maximize the
number of quadruples.

The key step is to list all possible sixteen combinations of A’s and B’s that form quadruples and to attach a variable
to each of these combinations, as shown in Table B.3. In terms of the ni’s, the numbers of (A,B) pairs in each data set
is given by the expressions listed in Table B.4.
Next, we simply count the number of times a pair (±1,±1) occurs in the data sets D1, D2, D3 and D4, and
denote the sixteen numbers thus obtained by N1(+1,+1),N1(+1,−1),...,N4(+1,−1),N4(−1,−1). These numbers

completely determine the values of the correlations C1, C2, C3, and C4, e.g., C1 = (N1(+1,+1) −N1(+1,−1) −
N1(−1,+1)+N1(−1,−1))/N. The same sixteen numbers serve as input to the linear optimization problem. Denoting
the number of pairs (A,B) in data set Dk that do not belong to the set of quadruples by uk(A,B) ≥0, we must have
Nk(A,B) = nk(A,B)+uk(A,B) , N = ∑

Nk(x,y) , U = ∑
x,y=±1
uk(x,y) ,
(B.30)
for k = 1,2,3,4 and all pairs (A,B) = (±1,±1). Note that U cannot depend on k because the number of pairs which
do not belong to the set of quadruples must be the same for all four data sets.
The ﬁnal step is then to minimize the number of pairs which do not belong to the set of quadruples, that is we

in 32 unknowns (the mi’s and uk(A,B)’s), subject to 33 inequality constraints (mi,uk(±1,±1),U ≥0 for all i,k) and
16 equality constraints (see Eq. (B.30)). For all cases that we have studied, the linear programming solver yields
integer-valued solutions only.
The results of several numerical experiments using N = 1000000 pairs per data set can be summarized as follows:
• If the A’s and B’s are generated in the form of quadruples all taking random values ±1, the program returns
∆= 1, |C1 −C2|+|C3 +C4| = 0.00063, and |C1 +C2|+|C3 −C4| = 0.0028 such that Eq. (B.9) is satisﬁed.
• If all A’s and B’s take independent random values ±1, the C’s are approximately zero. We have |C1∓C2|+|C3±
C4| ≤4 −2∆= 2(1 + ε) where 1 ≫ε ≥0 reﬂects the statistical ﬂuctuations in N1(+1,+1), N1(+1,−1), ...,
N4(+1,−1), N4(−1,−1). This, perhaps counter intuitive, result may be understood by referring to Eq. (B.29).
If N is very large, we may (in the case at hand) expect that N1(+1,+1) ≈N1(+1,−1) ≈... ≈N4(+1,−1) ≈
N4(−1,−1) ≈N/4. From Eq. (B.28) it then follows that e∆= 1−ε. In our numerical experiment, ε = 0.002.
• If the pairs (A1,i,B1,i), (A2,j,B2,j), (A3,kB3,k), and (A4,lB4,l) are generated randomly with frequencies (1 −
c1A1,iB1,i)/4, (1−c2A2,jB2,j)/4, (1−c3A3,kB3,k)/4, and (1−c4A4,lB4,l)/4, respectively, the simulation mimics
the case of the correlation of two spin-1/2 objects in the singlet state if we choose c1 = −c2 = c3 = c4 = 1/
√
2.
Recall that in this particular case, quantum theory yields max(|C1 ∓C2|+|C3 ±C4|) = 2
√
2 ≈2.83 [98], see
also Section 11.2.
Generating four times one million independent pairs, we obtain b∆≈0.047, e∆≈0.292, ∆≈0.585, SCHSH =
|C1 −C2|+|C3 +C4| ≈2.83 and 4−2∆≈2.83, demonstrating that the value of the quantum-theoretical upper
bound 2
√
2 is reﬂected in the maximum fraction of quadruples that one can ﬁnd by reshufﬂing the data.
• Same as in the previous case except that we use the probabilistic model of Section 11.5 as the basis for the CM to
generate pairs of data for the case d = 6 for which SCHSH ≈3.20 > 2
√
2 ≈2.83, showing that these data cannot
be described by a quantum-theoretical model of two spin-1/2 objects. Choosing c1 = −c2 = c3 = c4 = 0.80
and generating four times one million independent pairs, we obtain SCHSH = |C1 −C2|+|C3 +C4| ≈3.20 and
4−2∆≈3.20.

• Same as in the previous case except that we consider the case d = 8 for which SCHSH ≈3.34 > 2
√
2 ≈2.83,
showing that these data cannot be described by a quantum-theoretical model of two spin-1/2 objects. Choosing
c1 = −c2 = c3 = c4 = 0.83 and generating four times one million independent pairs, we obtain SCHSH = |C1 −
C2|+|C3 +C4| ≈3.34 and 4−2∆≈3.34.
• In Appendix B.1, we have used the data of the “Signiﬁcant-Loophole-Free Test of Bell’s Theorem with En-
tangled Photons” experiment [41] to estimate that the fraction of quadruples that can be created by reshuf-
ﬂing the data is ∆≲0.99999273. Using the quantum state (|HV⟩+ r|VH⟩)/
√
1+r2 assumed to describe the
ideal experiment [41], we obtain SCHSH ≈2.34 > 2 and (see Eq. (B.17)) (N++(a,c)−N++(b,d)−N−+(b,c)−
N+−(a,d))/N ≈0.085 > 0, where a, b, c, and d correspond to the angles 94.4◦, 62.4◦, −6.5◦, and 25.5◦, respec-
tively, and r = −2.9. Generating four times one million independent pairs (A1,i,B1,i), (A2,j,B2,j), (A3,kB3,k),
and (A4,lB4,l) with frequencies corresponding to the quantum -theoretical probabilities, we obtain b∆≈0.275,
e∆≈0.491, ∆≈0.829, such that 4−2∆≈2.34 ≈SCHSH. As mentioned in Appendix B.1, the value of ∆≈0.829
obtained from the quantum-theoretical model does not necessarily relate to the value ∆≲0.99999273 obtained
by analyzing the experimental data.
• In the case of Bell’s modiﬁed toy model (see Appendix L.1) for which C(a,c) = −(1/2)cos(a −c) or the
probabilistic model of Section 11.5 with d = 0 orW > T0, we have SCHSH =
√
2. Choosing c1 = −c2 = c3 = c4 =
1/2
√
2 and generating four times one million independent pairs, we obtain SCHSH = |C1−C2|+|C3+C4| ≈1.42
and 4−2∆≈2.00.
Except in the ﬁrst case, the values of ∆quoted in the other cases ﬂuctuate a little if we repeat the N = 1000000
simulations with different random numbers. Except for the ﬁrst, second, and last case, the data suggest that inequality
Eq. (B.9) can be saturated.

Figure B.10: Layout of the extended Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm thought experiment with spin-1/2 particles [56, 97]. A source is emitting a
pair of magnetic particles in two spatially separated directions, directed towards observation station 1 and 2. The observation station 1 (2) contains
three identical Stern-Gerlach magnets SG1, SG3, and SG4, (SG2, SG5, and SG6) with their uniform ﬁeld component along the directions a, b, and
b (c, d, and d), respectively. Particles leaving SG3,...,SG6 are registered by identical, ideal detectors (not shown). The binary variables xi,j = 0,1
for i = 1,2,3,4 and j = 1,2 indicate which of the four detectors at the left (j = 1) and right ( j = 2) ﬁre. For each incoming particle, only one of the
detectors in station 1 and only one of the detectors in station 2 ﬁres, implying that for j = 1,2, only one of x1,j, x2,j, x3,j, and x4,j can be nonzero.
For each pair of particles emitted by the source, this experiment produces the quadruple (S1,S2,S3,S4).
47

Figure B.10 shows the layout of an extended Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm (EEPRB) experiment with spin-1/2
particles [56, 97]. In this idealized experiment, all Stern-Gerlach magnets perform selective (ﬁltering) measure-
ments [6, 123]. Selective measurements allow us to attach an attribute with deﬁnite value (e.g. the direction of
the magnetic moment) to the particle. For instance, assuming that SG1, SG3 and SG4 perform ideal selective mea-
surements, a particle leaving SG1 along path S1 = +1 (S1 = −1) will always leave SG3 (SG4) along path S2 = +1
(S2 = −1) if b = a. In this case, the value of this attribute (called spin in quantum theory) is given by S1. The same
procedure is used to attach attributes to particles leaving the other Stern-Gerlach magnets.
As only one of x1,1, x2,1, x3,1, and x4,1 and only one of x1,2, x2,2, x3,2, and x4,2 can be nonzero (see also Fig. B.10),
the four variables

=
x1,1 +x2,1 −x3,1 −x4,1 ,
S2
=
x1,1 −x2,1 +x3,1 −x4,1 ,

=
x1,2 +x2,2 −x3,2 −x4,2 ,
S4
=
x1,2 −x2,2 +x3,2 −x4,2 ,
(B.32)
can only take values +1 or −1. Clearly, S1 and S2 (S3 and S4) encode, uniquely, manner, the path that the left (right)
going particle took. The four variables Eq. (B.32) form a quadruple (S1,S2,S3,S4) which completely describes the
outcome of the experiment for each pair of particles emitted by the source.
Next, we attach a pair label n to the S’s and compute correlations according to

(B.33)
Because the EEPRB experiment generates quadruples only, ∆= 1. Therefore, it follows from Eq. (B.9) that indepen-
dent of the directions a, b, c and d, we must have

 ≤|Kik −Kil|+
Kjk +Kjl
 ≤2 , (i, j,k,l) ∈πππ4 .
(B.34)
One run of the extended EPRB experiment yields enough data to compute all possible correlations of the four S’s.
For instance, we have K13 = Cac, K14 = Cad, K23 = Cbc, and K24 = Cbd, showing that one run of the extended EPRB
experiment sufﬁces to compute all the correlations that would be obtained by four runs of the EPRB experiment for
the conditions (a,c), (a,d), (b,c), and (b,d). Of course, the essential difference between these two experiments is
that the former always generates quadruples (S1,n,S2,n,S3,n,S4,n) whereas the latter not necessarily does.
In conclusion, if the four correlations that appear in the Bell-CHSH inequality are obtained by performing the
EEPRB experiment, we have
SCHSH ≤2 ,
(B.35)
showing that these correlations can never violate the Bell-CHSH inequality [56, 97] even though all pair-wise corre-
lations are given by the quantum-theoretical description in terms of the singlet state.
Appendix C. Plausibility versus mathematical probability
Plausible reasoning is concerned with relating the truth of propositions given the truth of other propositions [103].
The key concept is the plausibility, denoted by a real number p(A|B), quantifying that proposition A is true conditional
on proposition B being true. Logical inference is the mathematical framework, a set of rules, by which we perform
calculations with plausibilities. Logical inference allows us to reason in a logically consistent manner which is both
unambiguous and independent of the individual, in particular if there are elements of uncertainty in the description.
For a detailed discussion of the foundations of plausible reasoning, its relation to Boolean logic and the derivation of
the rules of logical inference, see Ref. [7, 104, 105, 124, 125]. It can be shown that plausibilities may be chosen to
take values in the range [0,1] and obey the rules [7, 104, 105, 124, 125]
a. p(A|Z)+ p( ¯A|Z) = 1 where ¯A denotes the negation of proposition A, and Z is a proposition assumed to be true.
48

b. p(AB|Z) = p(A|BZ)p(B|Z) = p(B|AZ)p(A|Z) where the “product” BZ denotes the logical product (conjunction)
of the propositions B and Z, that is the proposition BZ is true if both B and Z are true. Deﬁning a plausibility for a
proposition conditional on the conjunction of mutual exclusive propositions is regarded as nonsensical.
c. p(A ¯A|Z) = 0 and p(A + ¯A|Z) = 1 where the “sum” A + B denotes the logical sum (inclusive disjunction) of the
propositions A and B, that is the proposition A + B is true if either A or B or both are true. These two rules show
that Boolean algebra is contained in the algebra of plausibilities.
The rules (a–c) are unique. Any other rule which applies to plausibilities represented by real numbers and is in conﬂict
with rules (a–c) will be at odds with common-sense reasoning and consistency [7, 124, 125].
“Mathematical probability” refers to the key concept in Kolmogorov’s axiomatic framework of probability the-
ory [3]. Clearly, the rules (a–c) are identical to those of the calculus of probability theory [3, 126, 127]. However,
logical inference does not involve concepts such as set theory, sample spaces, random variables, probability mea-
sures, countable (or ﬁnite) additivity, etc., which all are essential to the mathematical foundation of probability the-
ory [3, 126, 127]. Perhaps most important is that in general, the logical inference approach does not require (but can
also deal with) a set of elementary events or propositions into which the propositions under scrutiny can be resolved.

(D.1)
The solution ∂E12(θ)/∂θ = 0 can be discarded because then IF(θ) = 0, corresponding to the uninteresting case in
which the correlation between the x and y does not change with θ. As −1 ≤E12(θ) ≤+1 (otherwise Eq. (11) does
not represent a plausibility), we may substitute E12(θ) = cosg(θ) in the expression in the right brackets and obtain

of which the only nontrivial solution reads g(θ) = uθ + ϕ where u and ϕ are constants of integration. Substituting
E12(θ) = cos(uθ +ϕ) in Eq. (12), we obtain IF(θ) = u2, independent of θ, as expected. Moreover, for n any integer,
θ +2nπ describes the same experiment with a·c = cosθ. Therefore, we must have E12(θ) = E12(θ +2nπ), implying
that u = n where n is a positive integer (we exclude n = 0 because then E12(θ) does not depend on θ) and we have
E12(θ) = cos(nθ +ϕ) ,
IF(θ) = n2 ,
n = 1,2,... .

Appendix E. Bell’s proof of his theorem
In the ﬁrst proof of his theorem [43], Bell explicitly used the assumption of perfect anticorrelation to derive an
inequality which is slightly different from Eq. (N.9a). The theorem then follows from a contradiction derived by using
this inequality. Adopting Bell’s notation (but omitting the bars), written in full detail Eq. (N.9a) reads

Z
A(a,λ)B(d,λ)µ(λ)dλ

(E.1)
Let us temporarily allow for the idea that data and a model thereof live in the same universe. If we were to
insist that the functions A(a,λ), B(c,λ), and B(d,λ), living in the realm of the MM, map one-to-one to the out-
comes of the EPRB laboratory experiment, we face two problems. In Eq. (E.1) and also in Bell’s original proof,
A(a,λ),B(c,λ),B(d,λ) ∈[−1,+1] and as the outcomes take values ±1 only, the mapping between the real numbers
49

and the discrete data does not exist. Let us therefore consider the special case that A(a,λ),B(c,λ),B(d,λ) = ±1.
Then, the mapping exists, at least mathematically.
With the EPRB setup in mind (see Fig. 2), A(a,λ) = ±1 represents data collected on, say the left side whereas
B(c,λ) = ±1 and B(d,λ) = ±1 would represent data collected on the opposite side. Clearly, this creates an appar-
ent conﬂict because in an EPRB laboratory experiment we cannot have one side collecting both B(c,λ) = ±1 and
B(d,λ) = ±1 simultaneously if c ̸= d. However, from the viewpoint of data collected in the EPRB laboratory exper-
iment, there is no conﬂict at all. Performing the experiment with settings (a,c) yields data for A(a,λ) and B(c,λ).
Likewise, performing the experiment with settings (a,d) and the same set of λ’s as used in the ﬁrst experiment
yields data for A(a,λ) and B(d,λ). From these data we certainly can compute (approximations to) the three integrals
in Eq. (E.1), even though we cannot perform an experiment to measure B(c,λ) and B(d,λ) simultaneously. This
apparent conﬂict illustrates once more that empirical data and a model thereof do not live in the same universe.
Bell’s proof does not suffer from the named conﬂict. Bell wrote [43, 93]
Z
A(a,λ)B(c,λ)µ(λ)dλ −
Z
A(a,λ)B(d,λ)µ(λ)dλ =

−
Z
A(a,λ)B(d,λ)(1+A(c,λ)B(c,λ))µ(λ)dλ .
(E.2)
Note that the integrands in Eq. (E.2) contain products of terms which are not accessible in an EPRB laboratory
experiment. However, in the universe of MMs this is not an issue as the functions that appear in Eq. (E.2) are well-
deﬁned. The last integral in Eq. (E.2) vanishes by Bell’s assumption of perfect anticorrelation A(c,λ) = −B(c,λ) for
all c. Using the triangle inequality and the assumption that |A(a,λ)| ≤1, |B(c,λ)| ≤1, |B(d,λ)| ≤1, we obtain

(E.3)
which is the inequality used by Bell to prove his theorem. Equation (E.1) is different from Eq. (E.3) but, as Bell
showed, also leads to the conclusion that the expressions of the correlations ⟨A(a)B(c)⟩= ±a·c, ⟨A(a)B(d)⟩= ±a·d,
and ⟨A(c)B(c)⟩= ±c·d is incompatible with Eq. (E.3). More generally, Bell’s theorem states that the correlation
C(a,c) =
Z
A(a,λ)B(c,λ)µ(λ)dλ ,
(E.4)
cannot arbitrarily closely approximate the function −a · c for all a and c [43, 93]. Assuming that C(a,c) = −a ·
c and choosing, for instance, a = (1,1,0)/
√
2, c = (1,0,0), d = (−1,0,0), Eq. (E.3) becomes
√
2 ≤0, clearly a
contradiction. Bell’s theorem is a restatement of the existence of contradictions, derived from Eq. (E.3).
The assumption of perfect anticorrelation is necessary to arrive at Eq. (E.3) but is not necessary to prove Bell’s
theorem, as Bell and CHSH (Clauser, Horn, Shimony and Holt) showed by considering four instead of three func-
tions [93, 94, 96], also avoiding the conﬂict of the kind mentioned earlier. In the case of four functions, the proof of
the theorem follows directly from Eq. (N.9b), as we now show.
Appendix E.1. Proof of the Bell-CHSH inequality
Using the triangle inequality and |xy±xz| ≤1±yz if |x| ≤1, |y| ≤1, and |z| ≤1 (see Eq. (N.5)) we have
|C(a,c)−C(a,d)+C(b,c)+C(b,d)| ≤|C(a,c)−C(a,d)|+|C(b,c)+C(b,d)|

(E.5)
50

In the proof of Eq. (E.5), there is no conﬂict of the type encountered in the proof of Eq. (E.1). If we assume that
C(a,c) = −a·c, it is not difﬁcult to ﬁnd a’s, b’s, c’s and d’s for which inequality Eq. (E.5) is violated. Bell’s theorem
is a restatement of the existence of these violations.
We emphasize that inequalities Eqs. (E.3) and (E.5) have been derived within the context of the MM Eq. (35) in
which the integration over λ is over the full domain of λ. From the perspective of EPRB laboratory experiments, the
application of Eq. (E.5) can only be justiﬁed if the data produced by the EPRB laboratory experiment comes in the
form of quadruples, as in the case of an extended EPRB experiment [97]. For all EPRB experiments performed up to
this day, there is no evidence that this is the case.
Appendix E.2. Bell’s theorem and separation of conditions
Applied to separating conditions in the description of EPRB data (see section (8), Bell’s theorem tells us that if
we are given data collected under conditions (c1,c2) with correlation C(c1,c2) it may, depending on the values taken
by the latter, be mathematically impossible to ﬁnd functions f(c1,λ) and g(c2,λ) such that
C(c1,c2) =
Z
f(c1,λ)g(c2,λ)µ(λ)dλ ,
(E.6)
if we impose the constraints |f(c1,λ)| ≤1 and |g(c2,λ)| ≤1. Given C(c1,c2), if it is found that there do not exist
scalar functions f(c1,λ) and g(c2,λ) satisfying the aforementioned constraints, and a density µ(λ) such that Eq. (E.6)
holds, using matrices instead of scalar function seems like the ﬁrst alternative to explore.
Appendix F. Application of Bell’s theorem to Stern-Gerlach experiments
Source
Figure F.11: (color online) Conceptual representation of an experiment with an idealized Stern-Gerlach magnet (cylinder). A source produces
neutral particles carrying magnetic moments that are aligned along the direction represented by the unit vector c. The magnetic ﬁeld gradient of
the Stern-Gerlach magnet with its uniform magnetic ﬁeld component along the directions of the unit vectors d diverts each incoming particle into
one of two, spatially separated directions labeled by Sd = +1 and Sd = −1. The discrete values of these labels describe the quantum state of the
magnetic moment of the particle. Particles leave the Stern-Gerlach magnet with their magnetic moment along ±d, labeled by the spin quantum
number Sd = ±1. Quantum theory predicts that the number of particles with quantum numbers Sd = ±1 is proportional to (1+Sd c·d)/2.
51

Bell’s theorem, see Section 11.1, stripped from all relations to the EPRB experiment, tells us that scalar functions
A(c,λ) and B(d,λ) such that
c·d
=
Z
A(c,λ)B(d,λ)µ(λ)dλ , |A(c,λ)| ≤1 , |B(d,λ)| ≤1 , 0 ≤µ(λ) ,
Z
dλ µ(λ) = 1 ,
(F.1)
do not exist. We apply Bell’s theorem to the experiment sketched and explained in the caption of Fig. F.11. According
to quantum theory, the number of particles leaving the Stern-Gerlach magnet along the direction labeled by Sd = +1
is proportional to (1+Sd c·d)/2. Consequently, the average value of Sd is ⟨Sd⟩= ∑Sd=±1 Sd(1+Sd c·d)/2 = c·d.
Thus, in the notation of Section 8, Bell’s theorem guarantees that there do not exist functions −1 ≤ez(λ,d) ≤1,
0 ≤ef(λ,c) ≤1 (with the symbol λ denoting an arbitrary collection of variables) and a measure 0 ≤µ(λ) ≤1 such
that
Z
ef(λ,c)µ(λ)dλ = 1
,
Z
ez(λ,d) ef(λ,c)µ(λ)dλ = c·d ,
(F.2)
for all unit vectors c and d.
From Eq. (F.2), it is clear that “locality” actually means “separation”, in terms of scalar functions in this case,
which depend on distinct conditions (c and d in this case). We emphasize that this no-go theorem is the result of
applying ‘Bell’s theorem to the Stern-Gerlach experiment, not to the EPRB experiment.
Appendix G. Direct proof of a less general Bell theorem: I
We simplify matters by replacing the three-dimensional unit vectors a, b and the hidden variable λ by two-
dimensional unit vectors that are speciﬁed by the angles a,b ∈[0,2π] and a real variable φ ∈[0,2π], respectively. We
give a simple, direct proof that for any differentiable, periodic, real-valued functions f(x) = f(x + 2π) or g(x + 2π)

Interchanging the roles of f(φ) and g(φ) leads to a similar expression.
If I(θ) = ±cosθ then ∂I(θ)/∂θ = ∓sinθ ∈[−1,+1]. But Eq. (G.5) shows that within this range, ∂I(θ)/∂θ
obtained from Eq. (G.2) can at most take the values ±1/π,±2/π,±3/π which clearly does not arbitrarily closely
approximate ∓sinθ for all θ. For instance, f(φ) = g(φ) = cosφ (see Appendix L.1) has two zeros and ∂I(θ)/∂θ =
−(2/π)sign[sinθ] = ∓2/π ̸= ∓sinθ for almost all θ.
Appendix H. Direct proof of a less general Bell theorem: II
In Appendix G, the ±1’s are obtained from the periodic functions sign[f(x)] and sign[g(x)]. Then, simply because
cos2(x) ̸= sign[f(x)], it is obviously impossible to reproduce Malus’ law. We can recover Malus’ law if we consider
periodic functions 0 ≤f(x) = f(x+2π) ≤1 and deﬁne
A(a,φ) =
Z 1
0 sign[f(φ −a)−r]dr
,
−1 ≤A(a,φ) ≤1 .
(H.1)
Indeed, if we choose f(x) = cos2(x) and use f(x) to deﬁne a CM that generates +1 (−1) events if cos2(x) > r
(cos2(x) ≤r), these events appear with a frequency given by Malus’ law.
Without invoking Bell-type inequalities, we now prove that for any well-deﬁned, real-valued periodic function

Equation (H.5) is equal to ∂2
θ coskθ = −k2 coskθ if |fk|2 = 1/8 and |fn|2 = 0 for all n ̸= k. Writing fk = |fk|eiψ with
ψ a real number, we have f(θ) = f0 + (1/

2)cosk(θ + ψ). By assumption 0 ≤f(θ), implying that we must have
f0 ≥1/

2. Then f(θ) ≥[1+cosk(θ +ψ)]/
√
2. For θ = −ψ, we have f(θ) ≥

2 > 1, contradicting the assumption
that f(θ) ≤1. Furthermore, Eq. (H.5) can never be equal to ∂2
θ [−coskθ] = +k2 coskθ because −8|fk|2 can never be
equal to one. This completes the proof.
Consider the case in which we require I(θ) = (1/2)cosθ instead of I(θ) = cosθ. Equation (H.5) is equal to
(1/2)∂2
θ [cosθ] = −(1/2)cosθ if |f1|2 = 1/16 and |fn|2 = 0 for all n > 1. It follows that we must have 0 ≤f0±1/2 ≤1
or f0 = 1/2 such that f(θ) = [1+cos(θ +ψ)]/2. Thus, the model Eq. (H.1) can produce a correlation

but not a correlation with the factor 1/2 removed.

Appendix I. Local hidden variable models: discrete data
In this, we derive inequalities for LHVMs in the case of discrete data. Adopting the notation used in Eq. (36),
application of the triangle inequality and Eq. (N.5) yields


µ(Vi)
≤2 ,
(I.1)
showing that the Bell-CHSH inequality also holds for LHVMs deﬁned by the ﬁnite sum Eq. (36).
The derivation of model-free inequality Eq. (B.9) did not rely on any assumption about the data other than that the
data are discrete, taking values in the interval [−1,+1]. In contrast, LHVMs assume that there is a rule that speciﬁes
how the value of a data item depends on hidden variables, collectively denoted by λ [43, 93]. In the following, we
change the notation somewhat to make it is easier to recognize the relation with the model-free derivation of inequality
Eq. (B.9).
Imagine repeating the EPRB experiment four times with speciﬁc combinations (a,c), (a,d), (b,c), and (b,d). We
denote the outcomes for condition x ∈{a,b,c,d} by A(x,λ) = ±1 and B(x,λ) = ±1 where λ plays the role of the
hidden variable, taking values in the domain Λ. In LHVMs, the actual value of A(x,λ) or B(x,λ) depends on both x
and on λ but, for the purpose of this section, there is no need to specify this dependence in more detail. Thus, instead
of e.g., A1,n in Appendix B, in LHVMs we have A(a,λn). Whereas the n in A1,n is simply a label for the nth data item
recorded under condition 1, A(x,λn) or B(x,λn) are assumed to be known mathematical functions for all x and λn, λn
being the value of λ for the n-th pair.
In four independent but equally long runs of length N, the EPRB experiment produces the discrete data A(a,λn),
etc., for n = 1,...,N. With these data, we compute the correlations
C(a,c)

(I.2)
The single, double and triple primes indicate that, in principle, the λ’s in each of the independent four runs may be
different.
Without any speciﬁcation of the domain the λ’s and without any knowledge about the process that generates them,
each of the correlations in Eq. (I.2) can take the value ±1 independent of the values taken by the others, yielding the
trivial bounds
|C(a,c)−C(a,d)+C(b,c)+C(b,d)|
≤
|C(a,c)−C(a,d)|+|C(b,c)+C(b,d)| ≤4 .
(I.3)
Assume that, for whatever reason, {λn |n = 1,...,N}={λ ′
n |n = 1,...,N}={λ ′′
n |n = 1,...,N}= {λ ′′′
n |n = 1,...,N}.
Then, it is possible to rearrange the terms in the sums in Eq. (I.2) such that for each n, the A’s and B’s appearing in
Eq. (I.2) form a quadruple, that is ∆= 1. From Eq. (B.9) it then follows that
|C(a,c)−C(a,d)+C(b,c)+C(b,d)|
≤
|C(a,c)−C(a,d)|+|C(b,c)+C(b,d)| ≤2 ,
(I.4)
which takes the form of the Bell-CHSH inequality Eq. (E.5).
We now ask ourselves if it is possible to “interpolate” between the case of total absence of knowledge about the
λ’s, yielding inequality Eq. (I.3), and the special case that led to the Bell-CHSH inequality Eq. (I.4). To derive a
useful inequality, we do not need to specify the domain of the λ’s, (they may represent e.g., different animals) but
we assume that the number of different λ’s is ﬁnite. In symbols λ ∈Λ = {λ1,...,λK}. At this stage, we make no
assumption about which λ’s of the set Λ appear in a particular run.
54

As the number of different λ’s is assumed to be ﬁnite, the sums in Eq. (I.2) may contain terms such that
λn = λ ′
n′ = λ ′′
n′′ = λ ′′′
n′′′. We denote the largest set of quadruples for which the latter condition is satisﬁed by Q =
{(n,n′,n′′,n′′′)|λn = λ ′
n′ = λ ′′
n′′ = λ ′′′
n′′′ ; n,n′,n′′,n′′′ ∈{1,...,N}}, whereby it is implicitly understood that different
quadruples (n,n′,n′′,n′′′) of Q differ in all four elements n, n′, n′′ and n′′′. Note that the number of elements in the set
Q is a lower bound to the maximum number of quadruples one can ﬁnd by considering the values of the A’s and B’s
instead of the values of the λ’s.
At this point, the problem of deriving an upper bound to |C(a,c)−C(a,d)|+|C(b,c)+C(b,d)| is identical to the
one solved in Appendix B, Therefore, we have
|C(a,c)−C(a,d)+C(b,c)+C(b,d)|
≤
|C(a,c)−C(a,d)|+|C(b,c)+C(b,d)| ≤4−2∆′ ,
(I.5)
where in this case, 0 ≤∆′ ≤∆≤1 quantiﬁes the fraction of times the same λ’s appear simultaneously in the four data
sets used to compute C(a,c), C(a,d), C(b,c), and C(b,d).
Appendix I.1. Illustration I
As a concrete realization of an LHVM, assume that there is a ﬁxed rule R, an “equation of motion” that, given the
current value of λ, yields the value of the next λ. For instance
λn+1 = R(λn)
,
n = 1,2,... .
(I.6)
We further require that the process λ1 →λ2 →... is periodic with period K. Symbolically, RK(λ) = λ for any λ ∈Λ.
If K ≤N we may write N = mK +r where m ≥1 and 0 ≤r < K. In other words, the number of quadruples with
the same λ’s is at least equal to mK and 4 −2∆′ = 2 + 2(1 −∆′) ≤2 + 2(N −mK)/N = 2 + 2r/N. Therefore, from
Eq. (I.5)
|C(a,c)−C(a,d)+C(b,c)+C(b,d)|
≤
|C(a,c)−C(a,d)|+|C(b,c)+C(b,d)| ≤2+ 2r
N .
(I.7)
Obviously, if K →N, then m →1 and r/N →0 or if K is independent of N and N →∞, Eq. (I.7) reduces to the
Bell-CHSH inequality |C(a,c)−C(a,d)+C(b,c)+C(b,d)| ≤2. If K > N, we have to determine ∆′ by computation
and use Eq. (I.5).
Appendix I.2. Illustration II
We consider four independent but equally long runs of length N and assume a from an experimental viewpoint,
more “realistic” scenario in which the order in which the K different values of λ ∈Λ = {λ1,...,λK} appear is unpre-
dictable. As the number K of different λ’s is ﬁnite, the correlations Eq. (I.2) can be written as

Appendix J. Proof of Lemma I
Lemma I: Given four, pair-wise compatible, nonnegative, normalized bivariates f(x1,x3|a,c), f(x1,x4|a,d),
f(x2,x3|b,c), and f(x2,x4|b,c) with moments K1, K2, K3, K4, K13, K14, K23, and K24 satisfying the Bell-CHSH
inequalities |K13 ∓K14|+|K23 ±K24| ≤2, there exists a number α satisfying
−1 ≤−1+max(|K13 +K14|,|K23 +K24|,|K3 +K4|) ≤α ≤1−max(|K13 −K14|,|K23 −K24|,|K3 −K4|) ≤1 . (J.1)
Proof: From Eq. (J.1), it follows that in order to prove the existence of (a range of) α, the following inequalities must
hold
−1+|K13 +K14|
≤
1−|K13 −K14| ,
(J.2a)
−1+|K13 +K14|

≤
1−|K23 −K24| ,
(J.2h)
−1+|K3 +K4|
≤
1−|K3 −K4| .
(J.2i)
Recall that all the moments that appear in Eq. (J.2) do not exceed one on absolute value. Then Eqs. (J.2a), (J.2e),
and (J.2i) follow directly from the basic inequality |x + y| + |x −y| ≤1 −xy + 1 + xy ≤2 (see Appendix N). Equa-
tion (J.2c) follows from |K3 −K4| = |K3 ±K1 −(K4 ±K1)| ≤|K3 ±K1|+|K4 ±K1| ≤2±(K13 +K14) ≤2−|K13 +K14|.
56

Replacing subscript 1 by 2, we prove Eq. (J.2f). In the same way, we can prove Eqs. (J.2g) and (J.2h). Finally, the
assumption that Bell-CHSH inequalites Eq. (54) hold is just rewriting Eqs. (J.2b) and (J.2d).
Lemma I shows that we may use any choice of α bounded as in Eq. (J.1) to assign a value to K34. By construction
and appeal to Eq. (N.6), K1, K3, K4, K13, K14, and K34 can be shown to satisfy all the inequalities Eqs. (48a)–(48c)
and so do K2, K3, K4, K23, K24, and K34 (with subscript 1 replaced by 2).

Appendix L. How to obtain the correlation C(a,c) = −a·c
As Bell’s theorem is mathematically sound, there is no way to obtain the correlation C(a,c) = −a·c if one sticks to
the conditions under which the theorem has been proven [43]. Thus, one way to obtain the correlation while retaining
the factorized form of Eq. (35) is to discard one or more of the conditions under which the theorem has been proven.
Another alternative is to forget altogether about Eq. (35) because as explained in Section 11.5, Eq. (35) may be too
primitive to capture the way the experimental data is collected and processed.
In this section, we keep the mathematics as simple as possible by focusing on models for EPRB experiments with
polarized light. Then a = (cosa,sina,0), c = (cosc,sinc,0), Malus’ law reads P(x|a,φ) = [1+xcos2(φ −a)]/2, and
the quantum-theoretical result of the correlation of two photons with their polarizations in the singlet state reads
C(a,c) = −cos2(a−c) ,
(L.1)
the extra factor two stemming from the fact that we are not considering spin-1/2 objects but photon polarizations, see
Section 7.1. Repeating the calculations with 3D vectors is a little more tedious but straightforward.
An NQM model for the EPRB experiment is considered to be physically relevant if (1) in the case of photons, the
model also complies with Malus’ law, or (2) in the case of spin-1/2 objects, the model yields P(x|a,S) = (1+xa·S)/2.
We ﬁrst review NQMs that fail to and then present NQMs that succeed to yield the correlation C(a,c) = −cos2(a−c).
57

Appendix L.1. Bell’s toy model
In Bell’s toy model, the correlation is given by Eq. (35) with
A(a,λ)

−B(a,λ) = sign[cos2(λ −a)] =

,
(L.2)
where 0 ≤2(λ −a) < 2π and λ denotes the polarization of the light beam. Model Eq. (L.2) is in blatant contradiction
with Malus’ law which predicts a sinusoidal dependence as a function of λ −a but has the virtue that the correlation
Eq. (35) has some interesting features.
With the explicit form Eq. (L.2) and µ(λ) = 1/2π, the integral in Eq. (35) can be carried out analytically, yield-
ing [43]
C(a,c)
=
Z
A(a,λ)B(c,λ)µ(λ)dλ = −1+ 2
π arccos(cos2(a−c)) .
(L.3)
For −π/2 ≤(a−c) ≤π/2, the correlation C(a,c) = −1+4|a−c|/π. Furthermore, for any a = c, we have C(a,c) =
−1 implying that is there is perfect anticorrelation, independent of the choice of a = c.
In Eq. (L.3), the integration over λ with weight µ(λ) can, but does not have to, be interpreted as the integration
over the realizations of the random variable λ with probability density µ(λ). If we adopt this view, then the individual
values of A(a,λ) will be random, either +1 or −1. Nevertheless, in Bell’s model, the ±1 events observed at the two
sides are completely correlated if a = b. Thus, in this probabilistic version of Bell’s toy model, if a = c (arbitrary)
knowing the value of say A(a,λ), we can predict with certainty that the value of B(c,λ) will be the opposite of A(a,λ),
even though the values of the A’s are random themselves. It is this feature of the correlation −a·c which is commonly
referred to in popular accounts of the EPRB experiment.
Appendix L.2. Bell’s modiﬁed toy model: Malus’ law
As mentioned in Appendix L.1, the model deﬁned by Eq. (L.2) does not comply with Malus’ law. However,
ﬁxing this only requires the simple modiﬁcation
A(a,φ,r) = sign[1+cos2(φ −a)−2r] ,
B(c,φ,r′) = −sign

1+cos2(φ −c)−2r′
,
(L.4)
where 0 ≤φ < 2π denotes the polarization of the light beam and 0 ≤r,r′ ≤1 are uniform random variables. From
Eq. (L.4), it follows immediately that the probability density to ﬁnd A(a,φ,r) = +1 is given by cos2(φ −a), in
agreement with Malus’ law.
With the explicit form Eq. (L.4) and µ(φ) = 1/2π, the integral in Eq. (35) can be carried out analytically, yielding
C(a,c)

2 cos2(a−c) .
(L.5)
It is important to note that, as already indicated by Eq. (L.4), there are two different random variables r and r′ at play.
Thus, in Bell’s language one might be tempted to write λ = {φ,r,r′}. However, then it is difﬁcult to imagine how
the station measuring A(a,φ,r) can know that it should use the r-part of λ whereas the station measuring B(a,φ,r′)
should use the r′-part of λ. We might try to avoid this conﬂict by assuming that r = r′ but then C(a,c) = −1 for all a
and c, which is unacceptable.
Thus, it is not obvious that Bell’s λ is sufﬁciently general to include the simple variant Eq. (L.4) of Bell’s toy
model. However, Bell also showed that his theorem holds true if we replace A(a,λ) and B(c,λ) by A(c,λ) and
B(c,λ) obtained by averaging with respect to “distributions of instrument variables” [93, 96]. In Eq. (L.4), r and r′
play the role of these instrument variables. In summary, model Eq. (L.4) satisﬁes the conditions for proving Bell’s
theorem, as conﬁrmed by Eq. (L.5).
The factor 1/2 that appears in front of the cosine in Eq. (L.5) is a common feature of factorable models (such as
the one discussed in Appendix L.3) that comply with Malus’ law. In essence, recovering the quantum-theoretical
results C(a,c) = −cos2(a−c) amounts to constructing models that change 1/2 into 1.

Appendix L.3. Classical electrodynamics
According to empirical evidence, the intensity of light passing through a polarizer is given by Malus’ law
I(x|a,φ,I0(t))
=
I0(t)1+x cos2(φ −a)
2
,
(L.6)
where x = ±1 labels the directions of the outgoing light, φ and a represent the polarization of the incoming light
and orientation of the polarizer, respectively. The total intensity of light impinging on the polarizer is I0(t) which is
assumed to ﬂuctuate with time. In this section, ⟨f(t)⟩= T −1 R T
0 f(t)dt denotes the time average of a function f(t)
over the time of observation T.
As usual, it is expedient to work with dimensionless variables. To this end, we divide both sides of Eq. (L.6) by
the time-averaged intensity and obtain
I(x|a,φ,r(t))
⟨I0(t)⟩
=
I0(t)
⟨I0(t)⟩
1+x cos2(φ −a)
2
= r(t)1+x cos2(φ −a)
2
,
(L.7)
where r(t) = I0(t)/⟨I0⟩≥0 is a dimensionless random variable with time average ⟨r(t)⟩= 1. By construction we have
⟨I(x|a,φ,r(t))⟩
⟨I0⟩
=
1+x cos2(φ −a)
2
,
(L.8)
which is the dimensionless form of Malus’ law, as expected.
For simplicity, we assume that the left and right going light beams in the EPRB setup have exactly the same
intensity at any time and that their polarizations differ by φ0, which is ﬁxed in time. Then, the expression of the
time-averaged correlation of the two normalized intensities reads
⟨I(x,y|a,c,φ,φ0)⟩
⟨I0⟩2
=
⟨r2(t)⟩1+x cos2(φ −a)
2
1+y cos2(φ −c+φ0)
2
.
(L.9)
Next, we imagine that we collect data for Eq. (L.9) by repeating the experiments for many values of the polarization
0 ≤φ < π. Integrating over all polarizations with uniform density 1/π, the correlated intensity is found to be
I(x,y|a,c,φ0)

(L.10)
Thus, this classical, Maxwell-theory model yields for the correlation
C(a,c)
=
∑
x,y=±1
xyI(x,y|a,c,φ0) = ⟨r2(t)⟩
2
cos2(a−c+φ0) .

A very simple model for the ﬂuctuating intensity can be constructed as follows. We start from

Z T
0 rk(t)dt
≈
1
N
N−1
∑
n=0
rk(nT/N) = ⟨rk⟩N .
(L.12)
and assume that r(nT/N) is a random variable with the probability density p(r(nT/N)) = exp(−r(nT/N)) for each
n = 0,...,N−1. It is easy to check numerically that for each realization of the set of variables {r(0),r(T/N),...,r((N−
1)T/N)}, we have ⟨r(t)⟩N →1 and ⟨r2(t)⟩N →2 as N →∞. Of course, the same result is obtained by replacing
rk(nT/N) by its average. Thus, this simple model yields ⟨r2(t)⟩= 2 and therefore the correlation Eq. (L.11) becomes
C(a,c)
=
∑
x,y=±1
xyI(x,y|a,c,φ0) = cos2(a−c+φ0) .
(L.13)
If φ0 = π/2, Eq. (L.13) agrees with the desired quantum-theoretical expression −cos2(a −c) for the correlation of
two photons with their polarizations described by the singlet state.
59

A key difference between the classical wave mechanical model and quantum theory of spin-1/2 objects is that in
the latter, the results of quantum measurements, an abstract theoretical concept, are discrete, either +1 or −1 whereas
in the former, the intensity can, in principle, take all possible non-negative real values. Of course, the light intensity
measured in real experiments takes discrete values (the resolution of any measurement device being ﬁnite) but the fact
remains that these discrete values are not bound to the interval [0,1].
In conclusion, the local realistic, classical wave mechanical model based on Eqs. (L.6) and (L.9)
1. complies with Malus’ law and can yield the desired correlation C(a,c) = −cos2(a −c) for two light beams
with opposite but otherwise random polarization,
2. does not satisfy the conditions necessary to prove Bell’s theorem because 0 ≤r(t) can exceed one, implying
that the conditions A(x|a,λ) ≤1 and B(x|c,λ) ≤1 in Eq. (35) are not satisﬁed,
3. yields the correlation C(a,c) = +cos2(a −c) if φ = 0, a result which is incompatible with the quantum-
theoretical model of two spin-1/2 objects.
Appendix L.4. A system of two classical spins
We start from the representation Sj = Sj(cosφ j sinθj,sinφ j sinθj,cosθ j)T for j = 1,2, of the classical spins and
introduce the unit vectors aj = (cosαj sinβj,sinαj sinβj,cosβj)T for j = 1,2 to specify two directions. We assume
that the length of the spins Sj ≥0 is distributed according to a yet unspeciﬁed (probability) density p(S1,S2).
We consider a pair of spins that is perfectly anticorrelated, that is S1 = −S2, implying that S1 = S2 = S, θ1 =
θ2 +π = θ, φ1 = φ2 = φ. We assume that the vectors representing pairs of the same length S uniformly cover the 3D
sphere of radius S. With these assumptions, the (probability) density for all pairs reads p(S1,S2) = p(S1)δ(S1 +S2) =
S2µ(S)sinθ δ(S1 +S2), where the function µ(S) ≥0 is to be determined later.
Expressing the requirement that the density p(S1,S2) is normalized to one yields

We recover the quantum-theoretical result bE12(a1,a2) = ⟨a1 · σσσ1 a2 · σσσ2⟩= −a1 · a2 if we choose the density µ(S)
such that Eq. (L.14) holds and that

R ∞

R ∞
0 S4 µ(S)dS =
3. There are many other solutions to Eqs. (L.14) and (L.18), for instance µ(S) = (1/3)δ(S −1) + (1/6)δ(S −2), a
very simple one.
As in the classical electrodynamics model discussed in Appendix L.3, the result Eq. (L.17) together with
R ∞
0 S4 µ(S)dS =
3 does not contradict Bell’s theorem because the latter involves functions |A(a,λ)| ≤1 and |B(b,λ)| ≤1 whereas
Eq. (L.17) is obtained by computing the correlation between two 3D vectors of lengths exceeding one.
To mimic a product state, we assume that p(S1,S2) = δ(S1 −M1)δ(S2 −M2) where M1 and M2 are 3D vectors
which are considered to be ﬁxed. Then we have
⟨a1 ·S1⟩
=

⟨a2 ·S2⟩
=
a2 ·M2 ,
(L.19b)
⟨a1 ·S1 a2 ·S2⟩
=
a1 ·M1 a2 ·M2 ,
(L.19c)
in full agreement with the quantum-theoretical result Eq. (M.6) below.
In summary: we can recover the averages and the correlation −a1 ·a2 of the singlet and product state by replacing
the “quantum spins” by 3D vectors of variable length and making an appropriate choice of the density p(S1,S2).
Appendix M. Standard quantum theory of the EPRB experiment
We brieﬂy review the standard quantum-theoretical description of the EPRB experiment. Recall that a basic
premise of such a description is that the state of the quantum system, represented by the density matrix ρρρ, does not
depend on the kind of measurements that are carried out [6, 24].

in agreement with Eq. (29).

Appendix M.2. Product state
If the density matrix of a two-particle system can be written as ρρρ = ρρρ1 ⊗ρρρ2, the system is said to be described
by a product state [6]. Here ρρρi is the density matrix of particle i = 1,2. For two spin-1/2 objects described by a
product state we have bE12(a,b) = bE1(a,b)bE2(a,b) and the correlation bE12(a,b)−bE1(a,b)bE2(a,b) = 0. Therefore the
quantum state ρρρ = ρρρ1 ⊗ρρρ2 is called uncorrelated.
For two spin-1/2 objects, the product state takes the generic form
ρρρ
=
1+σσσ1 ·M1
2
1+σσσ2 ·M2
2
,
(M.4)
where M1 and M2 are 3D vectors with a length less than or equal to one. If ||M1|| = ||M2|| = 1, the product state
Eq. (M.4) is said to be pure, otherwise it is said to be mixed [6].
From Eq. (M.4) it follows that
P(x,y|a,c)

(M.6)
Appendix M.3. Factorability and independence
In general, the probability of two dichotomic variables taking values +1 and −1 can be written as
P(x,y|Z)
=
1+xE1(Z)+yE2(Z)+xyE12(Z)

= 1+xE1(Z)

=
P(x|Z)P(y|Z)+xy E12(Z)−E1(Z)E2(Z)
4
,
(M.7)
where Z stands for a collection of conditions.
By deﬁnition, if P(x,y|Z) = P(x|Z)P(y|Z) the variables x and y are (logically/statistically) independent [4]. If the
variables x and y are (logically/statistically) independent it immediately follows from Eq. (M.7) that their correlation
E12(Z)−E1(Z)E2(Z) = 0.
In general, zero correlation does not imply independence [4]. However, from Eq. (M.7) it also follows that
P(x,y|Z) = P(x|Z)P(y|Z) if the correlation E12(Z)−E1(Z)E2(Z) = 0.
In summary, the dichotomic variables x = ±1 and y±1 are (logically/statistically) independent if and only if their
correlation E12(Z)−E1(Z)E2(Z) = 0. This is a special property of a probability distribution of dichotomic variables.
In contrast, in quantum theory we can have zero correlation even though the density matrix does not factor-
ize. For example, the density matrix Eq. (M.1) cannot be factorized (ρρρ ̸= ρρρ1 ⊗ρρρ2) yet the correlation bE12(a,c) −
bE1(a,c)bE2(a,c) = bE12(a,c) = −a·c is zero if the vectors a and c are orthogonal.
Appendix M.4. Extension of Bell’s theorem to quantum-theoretical models
In this subsection, we generalize Bell’s theorem to the realm of quantum-theoretical models. As nothing is gained
by limiting the discussion to spin-1/2 systems we prove the theorem in full generality. We consider a composite
quantum system that consists of two identical subsystems i = 1,2. The state of subsystem i is represented by the
density matrix ρρρi(λ). The variable λ is an element of a set that does not need to be deﬁned in detail and plays exactly
the same role as in Bell’s theorem. We deﬁne a matrix ρρρ of the composite system by
ρρρ
=
Z
ρρρ1(λ)ρρρ2(λ)µ(λ)dλ,
(M.8)
where µ(λ) is a probability density, that is a nonnegative function, which satisﬁes
R µ(λ)dλ = 1 (compare with
Eq. (35)). Using the properties of the trace Tr , Tr ρρρ1(λ)ρρρ2(λ) = [Tr 1ρρρ1(λ)][Tr 2ρρρ2(λ)] = 1 and the fact that a sum
of nonnegative deﬁnite matrices with positive weights is a nonnegative deﬁnite matrix [128], it follows that Eq. (M.8)
62

is a proper density matrix for the system consisting of subsystems one and two. Density matrices ρρρ of the form
Eq. (M.8) are called separable. A product state is a special case of a separable state. In general, a separable state,
being a sum (integral) of uncorrelated states, is correlated.
To avoid mathematical technicalities, in the following we only consider quantum systems represented by ﬁnite-
dimensional Hilbert spaces. Consider two observables of each subsystem, represented by the matrices A1, B1, C2 and
D2, respectively. The entries of these matrices are assumed to have been rescaled such that all the eigenvalues of these
four matrices lie in the interval [−1,1] (the equivalent of the conditions on A(a,λ) and B(b,λ) in Eq. (35)). From
the deﬁnition of the quantum-theoretical expectation ⟨Xi⟩λ = Tr iρρρi(λ)Xi, it follows that for any λ, |⟨A1⟩λ| ≤1,
|⟨B2⟩λ| ≤1, |⟨C1⟩λ| ≤1, and |⟨D2⟩λ| ≤1.
The correlation between observables of the two subsystems is deﬁned by
Q(A1,C2) = ⟨A1C2⟩= Tr ρρρA1C2 =
Z
[Tr ρρρ1(λ)A1][Tr ρρρ2(λ)C2]µ(λ)dλ =
Z
⟨A1⟩λ⟨C2⟩λ µ(λ)dλ .
(M.9)
The correlations Q(A1,D2), Q(B1,C2) and Q(B1,D2) are deﬁned similarly.
Suppose that the two-spin system is described by the singlet state. Then we have Q(A1,C2) = bE12(a,c) = −a·c,
Q(A1,D2) = bE12(a,d) = −a·d, Q(B1,C2) = bE12(b,c) = −b·c, and Q(B1,D2) = bE12(b,d) = −b·d. Making use of
the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and recalling that a, b, c and d are unit vectors, we ﬁnd
bE12(a,c)−bE12(a,d)+ bE12(b,c)+ bE12(b,d)

(M.10)
where we also used ∥c−d∥2 +∥c+d∥2 = c2 +d2 = 2 and ∥c−d∥2 ∥c+d∥2 = (c2 +d2)2 −4(c·d2)2 ≤4. Therefore,
for the singlet state we have [98]
bE12(a,c)−bE12(a,d)+ bE12(b,c)+ bE12(b,d)

≤

√
2 .
(M.11)
There exists a choice for a, b, c and d for which equality in Eq. (M.11) can be reached. To show this it is sufﬁcient
to consider four vectors that lie in the x-y plane. Let us write a = (cosa,sina,0), etc. For the singlet state, we have
bE12(a,c) = −cos(a−c), bE12(a,d) = −cos(a−d), bE12(b,c) = −cos(b−c), and bE12(b,d) = −cos(b−d). Then take
a = 0, b = π/2, c = π/4 and d = 3π/4 to ﬁnd bE12(a,c)−bE12(a,d)+ bE12(b,c)+ bE12(b,d) = −2
√
2.
On the other hand, using the triangle inequality and Eq. (N.5) we obtain
|Q(A1,C2)−Q(A1,D2)+Q(B1,C2)−Q(B1,D2)|

(M.12)
In summary, the correlation bE12(a,b) = ⟨σσσ1 · a σσσ2 · b⟩of two spin-1/2 objects in the singlet state satisﬁes the
bound Eq. (M.11) [98] but may violate the bound Eq. (M.12). The only conclusion one can draw from violation of
the bound Eq. (M.12) is that there does not exist a separable density matrix that yields bE12(a,c) = −a·c for all a and
c. From a violation Eq. (M.12), it would be a logical fallacy to draw any other conclusion than the one just mentioned
simply because the derivation of Eq. (M.12) pertains to quantum theory only.

Appendix N. Basic inequalities
For any pair of real numbers u and v, the triangle inequality
|u+v| ≤|u|+|v| ,
(N.1)
and the identity
(u±v)2 +(1−u2)(1−v2) = (1±uv)2 ,
(N.2)
hold.
In this section, the symbols w, x, y, and z represent real numbers in the range [−1,1]. Applying Eq. (N.2) with
u = x and v = y, the second term in Eq. (N.2) is nonnegative such that
(x±y)2 ≤(1±xy)2 ,
(N.3)
or, equivalently,
|x±y| ≤1±xy .
(N.4)
Using Eq. (N.1) and Eq. (N.4) we obtain
|xy±xz|
=
|x||y±z| ≤1±yz ,
(N.5a)
|xz−xw+yz+yw|
≤
|xz−xw|+|yz+yw| ≤|x||z−w|+|y||z+w| ≤1−zw+1+zw = 2 .
(N.5b)
The variables appearing in Eqs. (N.5a) and (N.5b) form the triple (x,y,z) and the quadruple (x,y,z,w), respectively.
The triple/quadruple structure is essential to prove Eq. (N.5). For instance, an expression of the form |xz−xw|+|yz+
yw′| can be larger than 2 (e.g., (x,y,z,w,w′) = (1,1,1,−1,1) yields |xz−xw|+|yz+yw′| = 4).
Next, we prove that for any triple of real numbers a, b, and c,
|a±b| ≤1±c ⇐⇒|a±c| ≤1±b ⇐⇒|b±c| ≤1±a .
(N.6)
Written more explicitly, the inequalities |a±b| ≤1±c read −1∓c ≤a±b ≤1±c from which
−1+c
≤
a−b ≤1−c ⇒a+c ≤1+b and −1+b ≤a−c ,
−1−c
≤
a+b ≤1+c ⇒−1−b ≤a+c and a−c ≤1−b ,
(N.7)
or, written more compactly, |a±c| ≤1±b. In the same manner, we can prove that |b±c| ≤1±a.
Attaching subscripts to the x’s, y’s, etc., and denoting the correlation of x’s and y’s by
⟨xy⟩= 1
N
N
∑
i=1
xiyi ,
(N.8)
etc., repeated use of Eqs. (N.1) and (N.5) yields
|⟨xy⟩±⟨xz⟩|
≤
1±⟨yz⟩,
(N.9a)
|⟨xz⟩−⟨xw⟩+⟨yz⟩+⟨yw⟩|
≤
|⟨xz⟩−⟨xw⟩|+|⟨yz⟩+⟨yw⟩| ≤2 ,
(N.9b)
In exactly the same manner, one proves that |⟨xz⟩+ ⟨xw⟩| + |⟨yw⟩−⟨yz⟩| ≤2, |⟨xz⟩+ ⟨xw⟩| + |⟨yz⟩−⟨yw⟩| ≤2, and
|⟨xw⟩+⟨yz⟩|+|⟨yw⟩−⟨xz⟩| ≤2.

Appendix N.1. Application: discrete data
Inequalities Eqs. (N.9) can be used to detect inconsistencies between the data and their correlations [129]. Suppose
that we are given a set of discrete data Q3 = {(xi,yi,zi)|i = 1,...,n ; xi = ±1,yi = ±1,zi = ±1}, consisting of triples
(xi,yi,zi). Also suppose that ⟨xy⟩= 0.7 and ⟨xz⟩= −0.7. Then inequality Eq. (N.9a) puts a constraint on the values
that ⟨yz⟩may take, namely ⟨yz⟩≤1−1.4 = −0.4.
Conversely, assume that we are given three numbers α = 0.7, β = −0.7 and e.g., γ = 0.4. Does there exist a set
Q3 of triples of discrete data such that ⟨xy⟩= α and ⟨xz⟩= β and ⟨yz⟩= γ ? The answer is no for if there was, the
value of γ would be in conﬂict with the constraint ⟨yz⟩≤−0.4.
For a collection of two-valued quadruples Q4 = {(xi,yi,zi,wi)|i = 1,...,n ; xi = ±1,yi = ±1,zi = ±1,wi = ±1}
we can, in addition to Eq. (N.9a), use Eqs. (N.9) to ﬁnd constraints on the pairwise correlations.
In summary, if the averages ⟨xy⟩, ⟨xz⟩, and ⟨yz⟩violate at least one of the inequalities Eq. (N.9a) these averages
cannot have been computed from the data set consisting of triples. Similarly, if the averages ⟨xz⟩, ⟨xw⟩, ⟨yz⟩, and
⟨yw⟩violate at least one of the inequalities Eqs. (N.9) these averages cannot have been computed from the data set
consisting of quadruples. To the best of our knowledge, the inequality Eq. (N.9a) was (in a different but equivalent
form) ﬁrst given by Boole, who called it a condition of possible experience [129].
Appendix N.2. Application: real-valued functions
If we deﬁne the correlation of two functions x(λ) and y(λ) by
⟨xy⟩=
Z
x(λ)y(λ)µ(λ)dλ,
,
µ(λ) ≥0
,
Z
µ(λ)dλ = 1 ,
(N.10)
then the inequalities Eqs. (N.9) hold as long as |x(λ)| ≤1, |y(λ)| ≤1, |z(λ)| ≤1, and |w(λ)| ≤1.
Suppose that we are given three functions x(λ), y(λ) and z(λ), satisfying |x(λ)| ≤1, |y(λ)| ≤1 and |z(λ)| ≤1, and
for which ⟨xy⟩= 1/
√
2 and ⟨xz⟩= −1/
√
2. Then inequality Eq. (N.9a) forces ⟨yz⟩to be in the range ⟨yz⟩≤1−
√
2.
Next assume that we have three unit vectors a, b, c, and three functions x(a,λ), y(b,λ), and z(c,λ). Then
inequality Eq. (N.9a) rules out that there exist functions x(a,λ), y(b,λ), z(c,λ), satisfying |x(a,λ)| ≤1, |y(b,λ)| ≤1,
|z(c,λ)| ≤1 such that ⟨x(a)y(b)⟩= a · b, ⟨x(a)z(c)⟩= a · c, and ⟨y(b)z(c)⟩= b · c. Indeed, if we take a = (1,0,0),
b = (1,1,0)/
√
2, c = (−1,1,0)/
√
2, and use |⟨xy⟩±⟨xz⟩| ≤1±⟨yz⟩, we obtain
√
2 ≤1 which contradicts elementary
arithmetic. In essence, a similar argument was used by Bell to prove his theorem (see Section 11.1).
