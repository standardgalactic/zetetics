Abstract.
Classical Koopman–von Neumann Hilbert spaces of states are constructed here
by the action of classical random ﬁelds on a vacuum state in ways that support an action of
the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld and of the U(1)–invariant observables of the quantized
Dirac spinor ﬁeld, allowing a manifestly Lorentz invariant classical understanding of the
state spaces of the two ﬁeld theories, generalizing the Quantum–Mechanics–Free Systems of
Tsang&Caves and Quantum Non-Demolition measurements. The algebra of functions on a
classical phase space is commutative but the algebra of classical observables associated with
coordinate transformations is noncommutative, so that, for example, we can as much ask
whether a classical state is an eigenstate of a rotation as we can in quantum mechanics and
so that entangled states can be distinguished from mixed states, making classical random
ﬁelds as weird as quantum ﬁelds.

1. Introduction
If we are to understand the relationship between classical and quantum mechanics better
than through the somewhat ill–deﬁned process of quantization, one way to do so is to
construct a Hilbert space formalism for classical mechanics, as Koopman did in 1931[1],
and then to construct and examine in detail a very diﬀerent relationship between classical
and quantum mechanics, of isomorphisms between Hilbert spaces and operator algebras. We
can call this a uniﬁcation of classical and quantum mechanics, just as Dirac constructed a
uniﬁcation of Schr¨odinger’s diﬀerential equations and Heisenberg’s matrix algebras as Hilbert
space formalisms, even though we will ﬁnd that there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences:
there
are isomorphisms only for some quantum ﬁeld models (including, however, in particular,
quantized electromagnetism).
Such isomorphisms between classical and quantum Hilbert
space formalisms make consequences of the Hilbert space structure, such as the violation
of Bell inequalities, Gleason’s theorem, the Kochen-Specker paradox, and the rest, all not
as deﬁnitive as they have been held to be: quantum is not distinguished from classical by
Hilbert space structure and a noncommutative algebra of observables. Discussions of when
classical models can be eﬀectively used as physical models will in future have to depend on
more subtle distinctions.
It was shown in [2] that the Hilbert space of states over the complex Klein-Gordon
quantum ﬁeld is isomorphic to the Hilbert space of states over a real Klein-Gordon random
ﬁeld. [A similar construction can be found in [3, §5].] In [4] this was extended to show that
the Hilbert space of states over the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld is isomorphic to the
Hilbert space of states over an electromagnetic random ﬁeld. [This construction generalizes
the commutation of observables at time–like separation introduced as Quantum–Mechanics–Free
Systems in quantum optics in [5] to commutation at arbitrary space-like or time–like separation,
and a construction similar to this can be found in [6].] The construction for the electromagnetic
ﬁeld will be reproduced and extended here, in Section 2, followed by a construction of an
embedding of the algebra of global-U(1) invariant observables of the quantized Dirac spinor
ﬁeld into an algebra of Dirac spinor random ﬁeld operators in Section 3. [The construction
given here for the Dirac spinor ﬁeld has not previously appeared.]
For the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld ˆFµν(x), we can construct a commuting algebra R
that is generated by a bivector–valued random ﬁeld ˆFµν(x) for x anywhere in all of Minkowski
space, not just, as one might ﬁrst expect, on a space-like hyperplane. The Hilbert space of
the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld is generated by the action of ˆFµν(x) on the vacuum state,
then self-adjoint operators that act on the Hilbert space but do not commute with R generate
transformations that in classical physics are generated by the Poisson bracket.
For the quantized Dirac spinor ﬁeld, a Lie algebra D of global-U(1) invariant observables
can be constructed as a subalgebra of a bosonic raising and lowering algebra, D ⊂B, and
the usual vacuum state over D can be extended (here, trivially) to act over B, which contains
a commutative subalgebra that corresponds to a random ﬁeld on Minkowski space that is
enough to construct the Hilbert space of states over D.
Appendix A shows that we can for ordinary Classical Mechanics construct a Hilbert space
over R by a Koopman–von Neumann approach[1, 7] (see Appendix A for recent references);
the use of fourier transforms in ﬁeld theory, however, provides a natural complex structure,
allowing the construction of Hilbert spaces over C, so that, paradoxically, random ﬁelds are

somewhat closer to quantum ﬁelds than ordinary classical mechanics is to quantum mechanics.
[Some readers will feel that Appendix A should be in the main text of the paper, before Section 2,
because indeed Appendix A motivates and informs Section 2, however the mathematics in the main
text does not at all depend on Appendix A (which, to keep a relative simplicity, does not follow the
manifest Lorentz covariance of the main text).]
Hilbert spaces for random ﬁelds that are isomorphic to Hilbert spaces for quantum ﬁelds
will be constructed here only for free ﬁeld cases. Insofar as interacting QFT reduces to S-
matrices[8] —which map from in– to out–free ﬁeld Hilbert spaces—, the same S-matrix works
equally as well between random ﬁeld Hilbert spaces that are isomorphic to those quantum
ﬁeld Hilbert spaces. It’s not necessary to construct an interacting dynamics for the random
ﬁeld case insofar as we already have a successful interacting dynamics for the quantum ﬁeld
case, after regularization and renormalization, although hopefully having a random ﬁeld
construction also available may suggest new avenues.
The interpretation suggested here is that we can consider the states of free ﬁeld quantum
electrodynamics to be classical, for which the classical dynamics is a group of canonical
transformations acting on the states that is generated by a classical Hamiltonian, with a
parallel unitary quantum dynamics acting on the observables that is generated by a quantized
Hamiltonian operator. In the classical case, the action of the classical Hamiltonian requires
the use of the Poisson bracket to construct the Liouville operator, whereas the quantized
Hamiltonian has a direct adjoint action on observables. The construction in the main text,
however, will preserve manifest Lorentz and translation covariance throughout, implicitly
specifying a Poincar´e invariant stochastic dynamics.
There is also a subsidiary intention here to interpret quantum ﬁeld theory as a stochastic
signal analysis formalism, which in some empiricist sense quantum ﬁeld theory has to be
because experiments induce electrical and optical signals in cables, which are then statistically
analyzed in hardware and software (for a variety of approaches to stochastic signal analysis,
see [9, 10, 11]). A quantum ﬁeld operator (i) allows us to modulate the vacuum state, and (ii)
allows us to make local measurements of those modulated states, so it is often appropriate
to call the test functions that parameterize these operations (taken from a Schwartz space of
functions that are smooth both in real space and in wave number space) either (i) “modulation
functions” or (ii) “window functions” (alternatively, “sampling functions”) depending on how
they are used. Insofar as general relativity can also be interpreted in terms of signals between
places in space–time, a signal analysis interpretation for quantum ﬁeld theory introduces more
possibilities for unifying quantum theory with general relativity.
The existence of such constructions does not mean that this is the way the world is. In
particular, the constructions here are substantially nonunique, with there being many ways to
construct the same system of states over the algebra of quantum ﬁeld observables, so that it
is absolutely necessary to be skeptical about any given model just as we are about Maxwell’s
vortices or about Bohmian trajectories. Nonetheless, the constructions here are manifestly
Lorentz covariant, so they justify some further investigation of what advantages there might
be in developing the classical dynamics of the random ﬁeld states instead of developing the
unitary dynamics of the quantum ﬁeld states and observables. In any case, note that we are
determinedly working with Hilbert spaces, for which noncommuting observables are natural,
even if the way in which states are constructed can be (but does not have to be) construed
as more–or–less classical.

The notation used here may be oﬀputtingly novel except for mathematical physicists,
however it has a moderately principled motivation as an intrinsic vector formalism in the test
function space (which for free ﬁelds are equipped with a pre–inner product).
2. The electromagnetic ﬁeld
We can construct the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld ˆFf = af∗+a†
f, ˆF†
f = ˆFf∗, for bivector test
functions fµν(x), using a set of raising and lowering operators for which
⟨0| ˆF†
f ˆFg |0⟩= [af , a†
g] = (f, g)+,
[af , ag] = 0,
⟨0|a†
f = 0 = af |0⟩,
where
(f, g)± = −ℏ
Z

(2π)4
= −ℏ
Z
kα˜fαµ
∗(k)gµνkβ˜gβν(k)2πδ(k·k)θ(±k0) d4k
(2π)4,
which are positive semi–deﬁnite sesquilinear forms on the vector space of test functions
because kα˜f∗
αµ(k) and kβ˜gβν(k) are space–like 4–vectors that are orthogonal to the light–like
4–vector k (the form of this pre–inner product is derived in [12, Eq. (3.27)], for example). The
commutation relation [ˆFf, ˆFg] = (f∗, g)−(g∗, f) is zero if the supports of f and g are space–like
separated.
All of the above can be derived by constructing ˆFf as ˆFf =
R
fµν(x)ˆFµν(x)d4x, but a principal
aim of the notation is to work intrinsically in test function space, and manifestly Lorentz
covariantly, as far as possible. We can revert to a point–like quantum ﬁeld at a point y by
taking an improper test function fµν(x) that is a multiple of a Dirac delta function δ(x −y) or
to the fourier transform of the quantum ﬁeld at wave–number k by taking an improper test
function that is a multiple of eik·x, however careful models typically use less singular test
functions that include details such as line widths or pulse durations; indeed experiments may be
intended to produce states, such as Bessel beams, that require very carefully shaped test
functions as models. It is helpful that all geometrical information is isolated in the pre–inner
product, so that for the real Klein–Gordon quantum ﬁeld an intrinsic vector in a test function
space formalism has exactly the same presentation, except only that the pre–inner product for
scalar test functions f and g is diﬀerent,
(f, g)+ = ℏ
Z
˜f ∗(k)˜g(k)2πδ(k·k −m2)θ(k0) d4k
(2π)4 ,
and a comparable presentation is possible for the complex Klein–Gordon quantum ﬁeld, given
in Appendix B. It is also helpful that it is easy to make a connection to quantum optics or to
elementary discussions of quantum mechanics if we simply abbreviate ˆFf1, ˆFf2, ..., ˆFfn, as ˆF1, ˆF2,
..., ˆFn, and similarly for raising and lowering operators. The usually constructed quantized
electromagnetic ﬁeld, which supports an irreducible representation of the Poincar´e group,
follows as an inductive limit, taking the induction to be over a Schwartz space of smooth test
functions on Minkowski space.
We introduce projection to left and right helicity, f 7→1
2(1±i⋆)f, using the Hodge dual ⋆,
[⋆f]µν = 1
2εµναβfαβ, ⋆⋆f = −f (when acting on 2–forms), for which we ﬁnd (⋆f, g)± = −(f, ⋆g)±
and hence ( 1
2(1 ± i⋆)f, g)± = (f, 1
2(1 ± i⋆)g)±, so that we can construct raising and lowering
operators for independent left and right helicity components of the quantized electromagnetic
ﬁeld,
ˆlf = a1
2(1+i⋆)f,
ˆrf = a1
2(1−i⋆)f,
[ˆlf,ˆr†
g] = 0,

[ˆlf,ˆl†
g] = (f, 1

[ˆrf,ˆr†
g] = (f, 1
2(1 −i⋆)g)+,
ˆFf = ˆlf∗+ˆl†
f + ˆrf∗+ ˆr†
f .
Using the left and right helicity components and adopting the reversal introduced in [2],
f−(x) = f(−x), ef−(k) = ˜f(−k), we construct one of the possible alternative ﬁeld objects, ˆFf,
which will prove to be classical in the sense that the commutator is zero for all test functions,
[ˆFf, ˆFg] = 0,
ˆFf = ˆlf∗+ˆl†

so that, using the identities (f∗, g∗)± = (g, f)∓and (f−, g−)± = (f, g)∓,

+ = ⟨0| ˆFgˆFf |0⟩
is symmetric, and we can similarly show that [ˆFf, ˆFg] = 0. ˆFf is a classical Gaussian observable
with variance ⟨0| ˆFfˆFf |0⟩whenever f = f∗; however ˆFf, as a normal operator[13, 14], is an
observable even when f ̸= f∗in the sense that all components of its real and imaginary
parts are jointly measurable. Note that both the random ﬁeld and the quantum ﬁeld are
translation invariant even though the transformation between them is not, because (f, g)±
are both translation invariant.
For any state that we could construct by the action of a function of ˆFf1, ..., ˆFfn on
the vacuum vector |0⟩, for some set of bivector test functions {fi(x)}, we can construct
the same state by the action of some function of ˆFf•
1, ..., ˆFf•n, because the linear map
f 7→f• =
1
2(1 + i⋆)f + 1
2(1 −i⋆)f−is an involution, f•• = f. Consequently, we can, if we
wish, say that the states are classical even if we continue to say that the measurements are
nontrivially quantum mechanical. The algebras that are generated by ˆFf and by ˆFf are both
subalgebras of the commonplace raising and lowering algebra that is generated by af and a†
f,
ˆFf = af∗+ a†
f,
ˆFf = af∗• + a†
f•,
which are diﬀerent because f∗•̸=f•∗, so we can more–or–less say that the electromagnetic
random ﬁeld we have constructed here has been hiding in plain sight. With this presentation
of ˆFf and of ˆFf and using the vacuum state, the isomorphism of the two Hilbert spaces they
generate can be presented as an equality of normal–ordered expressions,
a†
g1· · · a†
gn|0⟩= :ˆFg1· · · ˆFgn:|0⟩= :ˆFg•
1· · · ˆFg•n:|0⟩,
with the Hilbert space inner product determined by the pre–inner product
⟨0| afn· · · af1a†
g1· · · a†
gn |0⟩.
We can equally take the opposite perspective, however, that the quantized electromagnetic
ﬁeld was always hiding in plain sight in the full algebra of observables of classical
electromagnetism, when we apply the constructions of Appendix A.

When considering how committed we should be to either a quantum or a random ﬁeld
perspective, it is instructive to consider how ﬂexibly committed quantum ﬁeld theory is to
microcausality.
In particular, quantum ﬁeld models commonly introduce state transition
probabilities as models of measurements, |⟨S1|S2⟩|2 = ⟨S1|S2⟩⟨S2|S1⟩, measurements of the
projection–valued observable |S2⟩⟨S2| in the state ⟨S1| · |S1⟩(with both normalized); weighted
sums of projection operators |Si⟩⟨Si| generate the space of normal operators on the Hilbert
space of states. The algebra of observables generated by |Si⟩⟨Si| can be generated by using
the vacuum projection operator |0⟩⟨0|, and in general we can construct operators of the form
ˆO(g; f) = a†
g1· · · a†
gn|0⟩⟨0|afn· · · af1
and sums of such operators, in which case we note that |0⟩⟨0| and ˆO(g; f) are essentially
global operators, [|0⟩⟨0|, ˆFf]̸=0, [ ˆO(g; f), ˆFf]̸=0 ∀f (and, for the random ﬁeld ˆFf, [|0⟩⟨0|, ˆFf]̸=0,
[ ˆO(g; f), ˆFf]̸=0 ∀f), which do not satisfy microcausality. Quantum ﬁeld models commonly
also discuss the measurement of number operators such as ˆNf=a†
faf , which also do not satisfy
microcausality.
If we allow the use of the vacuum projection operator for random ﬁeld
models, as indeed is appropriate for even moderately sophisticated classical signal analysis
(where time–frequency analysis for non-stochastic signals is well–known to require Wigner
and other quasi-distributions[15] because of the ubiquitous use of the fourier transform), the
algebras of observables as well as the Hilbert spaces are identical.
For the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld, the noncommutative algebra of operators that
is generated by ˆFf and the vacuum projection operator |0⟩⟨0| is isomorphic to the algebra
of operators that is generated by ˆFf and the vacuum projection operator |0⟩⟨0|, because the
vacuum projection operator |0⟩⟨0| does not commute with the commutative algebra generated
by the ˆFf. Including just this one projection operator |0⟩⟨0| is enough to generate the same
noncommutative algebra using the ˆFf as is generated by |0⟩⟨0| and using the ˆFf because the
Hilbert space is cyclic, generated by the action of the creation operators on the vacuum
vector. The algebras of operators that are generated by ˆFf and by ˆFf are both subalgebras
of the algebra generated by the raising and lowering operators.
A signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the random and quantum free ﬁeld algebras is the
irreducibility[16, p.101] (also referred to as completeness[17, §II.1.2]) of the algebra generated
by the quantum ﬁeld operators ˆFf, so that the quantum algebra can be considered preferable
to the commutative algebras generated by ˆFf.
The Poisson or Peierls bracket, however,
generates an algebra of transformations of the space of states or trajectories, so that if we
include canonical transformations between diﬀerent commutative subalgebras as an intrinsic
part of classical physics then there is no diﬀerence between the two constructions, insofar as
classical physics then does not give preference to any one maximally commutative subalgebra.
It is natural for classical physics that the vacuum projection operator must be introduced to
augment the algebra generated by the random ﬁeld operators ˆFf so that the transformations
generated by the Poisson or Peierls bracket, which are arguably as important as part of the
full classical theory as the observables, can be constructed. We can take the random ﬁeld
operators ˆFf to be a possible way to generate probability densities over a set of beables
of a modal interpretation of the theory (somewhat like ﬁnding a Lorentz invariant and
Hilbert space equivalent of de Broglie-Bohm trajectories), however to do so is to ignore
the classical algebra of transformations, under which, as in quantum theory, we would not
prioritize one maximal commutative subalgebra over another. Classical mechanics —when

Classical states, quantum ﬁeld measurement
7
fully construed as including the Poisson or Peierls bracket, the algebra of transformations,
and alternative maximal commutative subalgebras— has always been as “weird” as quantum
mechanics.
With the introduction of the vacuum projection operator, we must also note
that a Koopman–von Neumann vacuum state over the full noncommutative algebra gives
signiﬁcantly more information than a Liouville–type state over the commutative algebra
generated by the random ﬁeld operators ˆFf alone, particularly because a commutative algebra
cannot distinguish mixtures from superpositions.
For any quantum ﬁeld for which there is an involution on the test function space,
• : S →S; f 7→f •, f •• = f and for which the pre–inner product satisﬁes (f ∗•, g•) = (g∗•, f •),
whereas in general (f ∗, g) ̸= (g∗, f), we can construct a random ﬁeld that is equivalent in the
sense we have seen for the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld (the construction for the complex
Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld is given in Appendix B). This can be thought of as introducing
a new type of reﬂection positivity[18], which, however, preserves the 1+3–signature of space–
time.
We have presented the construction above using raising and lowering operators. Avoiding
their use, we can present the quantum and random ﬁeld structures for the electromagnetic
ﬁeld as
ˆF†
f = ˆFf∗
ˆF†
f = ˆFf∗
[ˆFf, ˆFg] = (f∗, g)+−(g∗, f)+
[ˆFf, ˆFg] = 0
⟨0| ˆFfˆFg |0⟩= (f∗, g)+
⟨0| ˆFfˆFg |0⟩= (f∗•, g•)+
:ˆFg1· · · ˆFgn:|0⟩= :ˆFg•
1· · · ˆFg•n:|0⟩
with all other connected Wightman functions being zero. The ﬁnal equality, which assumes
appropriately diﬀerent deﬁnitions of normal–orderings for the two cases, identiﬁes the Hilbert
spaces of the two theories, deﬁning an action of the algebra generated by the ˆFf on the Hilbert
space generated by ˆFf. It is also worthwhile to present the construction above in a more uniﬁed
Weyl–like coherent state formalism, using ˆW(f) = eiˆFf and ˆW(f) = eiˆFf,
ˆW(f)† = ˆW(−f∗)
ˆW(f)† = ˆW(−f∗)
ˆW(f) ˆW(g) = e−[(f∗,g)+−(g∗,f)+]/2 ˆW(f + g)
ˆW(f) ˆW(g) = ˆW(f + g)
⟨0| ˆW(f) |0⟩= e−(f∗,f)+/2
⟨0| ˆW(f) |0⟩= e−(f∗•,f•)+/2
e(f∗,f)+/2 ˆW(f)|0⟩= e(f•∗•,f)+/2 ˆW(f•)|0⟩
which can be seen to equate appropriately scaled coherent states. The expression f•∗• can be
simpliﬁed to f•∗• = f∗−= f−∗:

So as not to delay the discussion of the quantized Dirac spinor ﬁeld, a slightly complicated
discussion of potentials for ˆFf is presented in Appendix C.
3. The quantized Dirac spinor ﬁeld
First a terse presentation of the quantized Dirac spinor ﬁeld: we can construct the ﬁeld
operators ˆψU = dUc + b†
U for a Dirac spinor test function U using anticommuting raising and
lowering operators for which
{bU, b†
V } = {dU, d†
V } = (U, V )+,
{bU, bV } = {bU, dV } = {dU, dV } = {bU, d†
V } = 0,
⟨0|b†
V = ⟨0|d†
V = 0 = dV |0⟩= bV |0⟩
where for the pre–inner product (U, V )+ and its negative–frequency counterpart (U, V )−,
which is also positive semi–deﬁnite, we have
(U, V )±= ± ℏ
Z
˜U(k)(k·γ + m) ˜V (k)θ(±k0)dµm(k);
the measure dµm(k) = 2πδ(k·k −m2) d4k
(2π)4 on the wave–number space is zero except on the
forward and backward mass shells for mass m. With this construction,
⟨0| ˆψ†
U ˆψV |0⟩= ⟨0| bUb†
V |0⟩= (U, V )+
⟨0| ˆψV ˆψ†
U |0⟩= ⟨0| dV cd†
Uc |0⟩= (V c, Uc)+ = (U, V )−
{ ˆψ†
U, ˆψV } = (U, V ),
{ ˆψU, ˆψV } = 0,
where (U, V ) = (U, V )+ + (U, V )−[see below for a derivation of (V c, Uc)± = (U, V )∓]. The
anti–commutator { ˆψ†
U, ˆψV } is zero if the supports of the test functions U and V are space–
like separated. Explicitly, the vital equalities (Uc, V c)± = (V, U)∓depend on the identities
AcγµBc = BγµA and Ac Bc = −B A, because of which the arbitrary phase introduced by
charge conjugation cancels,
(Uc, V c)± = ± ℏ

˜V (k)(k·γ + m) ˜U(k)θ(∓k0)dµm(k)

All of the above can be derived by setting ˆψU =
R
Uc(x) ˆψ(x)d4x (with charge conjugation
introduced to ensure that the inessential but usual convention for quantum ﬁelds is followed,
that ˆψU is linear in the test function U), but, again, it is a principal aim to work intrinsically
in test function space as far as possible.
To proceed, we note that it is generally understood that for an operator to be an
observable of the quantized Dirac spinor free ﬁeld formalism it has to be invariant under
global-U(1) transformations (U(1)–gauge transformations are considered brieﬂy in Section 4),
for which the simplest case, ˆΦU = ˆψ†
U ˆψU = ˆΦ†
U, is a multiple of a projection operator,

and so that the commutator [ˆΦU, ˆΦV ] is closed in the algebra generated by ˆΦU (note that

( ˆψ†

behaves rather like a decimation operator relative to lower–level observables ˆΦUi (lower–level
in the sense that Supp(Ui) ⊂Supp(U)), with which it is in general incompatible. The vacuum
vector allows us to construct the vacuum state ⟨0| · |0⟩over the algebra generated by ˆΦU and
non–vacuum states such as
⟨0| ˆΦV1 · · · ˆΦVn
·
ˆΦVn · · · ˆΦV1 |0⟩
⟨0| ˆΦV1 · · · ˆΦVn ˆΦVn · · · ˆΦV1 |0⟩

The intentional restriction to using only the observable operators ˆΦV to generate states, which
can be characterized as zero charge states, is not operationally signiﬁcant, because we can
always construct operators ˆψ†
U ˆψV for which either U or V is at arbitrarily large separation
from the region of space–time that contains an experiment.
We can introduce a bosonic raising and lowering algebra that includes an observable that
satisﬁes the same Lie algebra as is satisﬁed by ˆΦU,

a real random ﬁeld using aU and a†

with trivial commutator,
[ˆχU, ˆχV ] = [aUc, a†

U, aV c]
= (Uc, V ) −(V c, U) = 0.
As a next step, we can extend the state we have over the algebra generated by the global-U(1)
invariant observables ˆΦU, which is therefore also a state over the ˆXU, to be a state ⟨F| · |F⟩
over the algebra generated by a†
Uc and aV c, which we will do here by the simplest possible
prescription, that any term in an expanded expression that cannot be presented as a product
of factors ˆXU will be assigned the value 0. The notation ⟨F| · |F⟩intends to emphasize that
the vacuum vector |F⟩is not annihilated by aV c, just as |0⟩is not annihilated by ˆψV .
The resulting state can be ﬁxed by constructing a generating function for the random
ﬁeld ˆχU,

This should be compared with the generating

⟨⊚| eiλˆχU |⊚⟩= e−λ2(Uc,U)/2.

so we can consider ⟨F| · |F⟩to be an equally weighted convex mixture of this state for all
test functions V for which (V, V )+ = (V, V ) = 1, so that ⟨F| · |F⟩is unitarily inequivalent
to ⟨⊚| · |⊚⟩. When Uc = U, ˆχU is Hermitian, so we obtain a probability density for single

This probability density for ˆXU ≡ˆΦU in the ground state of the fermionic ﬁeld is conventional
enough that by the usual rules of quantum mechanics we ought to be able to measure
it, however the probability density for the Dirac spinor random ﬁeld ˆχU is somewhat an
extrapolation. We can consistently suppose or imagine that there might be such a random
ﬁeld as ˆχU, and a state ⟨F| · |F⟩over those observables, behind the scenes of the observables
ˆXU, even if we can never measure them, or even if we never try to measure them, but we
could also think of them as a challenge, that such a ﬁeld might be there to be measured if
we can think of a way to do it. We can also take ⟨F| · |F⟩as an inspiration for other bosonic
ﬁelds, so that we could, for example, introduce a similar Poincar´e invariant state for the
quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld, using the ratio (f, 1
2(1−i⋆)f)+/(f, 1
2(1+i⋆)f)+ instead of the
ratio (U, U)+/(U, U)−,

electromagnetic ﬁeld is too exaggeratedly chiral to be physical without being considerably
molliﬁed as a mixture with the usual electromagnetic vacuum state, but such a construction
would likely not be thought of without this kind of investigation as an inspiration.
For any state generated by the action of ˆΦV on ⟨0| · |0⟩we have equivalences between

be reproduced by an appropriately chosen mixture of actions of ˆχV on the vacuum state
⟨⊚| · |⊚⟩; we could equally well say that such states are generated by a constrained action of
the algebra generated by ˆχV and call them classical.
The fermionic Hilbert space does not contain all the states we can construct using ˆχU
acting on |F⟩or on |⊚⟩(just as superselection prohibits many vectors that we could construct
using the unconstrained action of ˆψU and ˆψ†
U on |0⟩, allowing superpositions only of vectors of
equal global-U(1) charge), instead being restricted only to the states we can construct using
many diﬀerent ˆXV acting on |F⟩. In eﬀect, we are only able to construct states — from the
vacuum state we are given as a starting point— using the projective quantum mechanical
measurements we can actually perform, such as the ˆXU ≡ˆΦU, suitably normalized, so that
ˆX 2
U = ˆXU or equivalently ˆΦ 2
U = ˆΦU, corresponding to the yes/no sample space of waiting for
a detector somewhere to click. We can construct all the necessary states using the random
ﬁeld ˆχU, but the constraint is perhaps not at this point classically well–motivated enough for
us to say that such states are truly “classical”.
4. U(1)–gauge invariant observables
We here only indicate a possible approach to U(1)–gauge invariance.
Under U(1)–gauge
transformations, the Dirac spinor wave function transforms as ˆψξ(x) 7→eiθ(x) ˆψξ(x)[21,
Eq.
2-63], so that the vacuum expectation values iS+ξξ′(x, x′) = ⟨0| ˆψξ(x) ˆψξ′(x′) |0⟩and
iS−ξξ′(x, x′) = ⟨0| ˆψξ′(x′) ˆψξ(x) |0⟩transform as parallel transports,
iS±ξξ′(x, x′) 7→ei(θ(x)−θ(x′))iS±ξξ′(x, x′).
We can therefore construct two–point U(1)–gauge invariant operators (for both free and
interacting ﬁelds, supposing interacting ﬁelds exist), using these parallel transports and two

Dirac matrix–valued test functions, Pξ′η′(x′) and Qηξ(x),

Z
ˆψξ′(x′)Pξ′η′(x′)iS±η′η(x′, x)Qηξ(x) ˆψξ(x)d4xd4x′,
which we will write without indices as
R ˆψ(x′)P(x′)iS±(x′, x)Q(x) ˆψ(x)d4xd4x′. Of the possible
linear combinations of these two constructions,
R ˆψ(x′)P(x′)iS+⧸−(x′, x)Q(x) ˆψ(x)d4xd4x′,
where iS+⧸−(x′, x) = iS+(x′, x) −iS−(x′, x), is notably less singular on the light–cone in the
free ﬁeld case, indeed this is the least singular U(1)–gauge invariant construction known to
the author; in particular, it is less singular than constructions that use the electromagnetic
potential operator. The appearance of Dirac matrix–valued test functions P(x′) and Q(x)
in this U(1)–gauge invariant construction lessens the signiﬁcance of the double cover of the
Lorentz group. The construction
R ˆψ(x′)P(x′)iS+⧸−(x′, x)Q(x) ˆψ(x)d4xd4x′ cannot be written
as a simple product ˆψ†
U ˆψU, nonetheless it can be written in terms of bosonic raising and
lowering operators.
5. Discussion
The constructions above, for free quantum ﬁelds, which only apply where interactions are
taken to be insigniﬁcant —that is, to the in– and out–states of the S–matrix and to simple
quantum optics— do not touch on how we might discuss interactions in classical canonical
terms as well as or instead of in quantum unitary terms.
The introduction of negative
frequency components by the constructions here of random ﬁelds makes it impossible to
preserve the Correspondence Principle, which includes correspondence between 4–momentum
and wave–number, p = ℏk, with the energy component p0 required to be positive semi–
deﬁnite.
The Correspondence Principle, however, can be regarded as a property of the
quantization process, not of the Hilbert space that is created by quantization of a classical
dynamics, whereas the Koopman–von Neumann approach described in Appendix A is a
diﬀerent process for constructing the same Hilbert space from a diﬀerent classical dynamics,
for which frequency is not related in the same way to energy.
As noted in [4], there has been discussion of the similarities and diﬀerences between
“random electrodynamics” and quantum electrodynamics at least since the 1960s[22, 23],
however the algebraic formalism used here makes the comparison and the establishment of
empirical equivalence much more direct. The negative frequencies that appear explicitly in
the algebraic approach here appear implicitly in random electrodynamics (which has come
to be called “Stochastic Electrodynamics” or “SED”[24]) as a factor cos(k·r −ωt) in the
2–point correlation functions of the random electromagnetic ﬁeld[22, Eqs. (10), (13), and
(14)], instead of a factor ei(k·r−ωt) in the 2–point vacuum expectation values of the quantized
electromagnetic ﬁeld[22, Eqs.
(15), (16), and (17)].
The positive spectrum condition in
quantum ﬁeld theory can be thought of loosely as an a priori requirement for a complex
analytic structure, in contrast to an alternative requirement, for better or worse for diﬀerent
uses, for a classically real structure.
Although the main text has used a manifestly Lorentz invariant 4–dimensional block
world formalism, if we choose a time–like 4–vector we can construct a 3–dimensional

formalism by reducing
2πδ(k·k −m2) d4k

(2π)4,
and hence reduce the 4–dimensional formalism to a 3–dimensional formalism, so we do not
have to interpret the formalism as requiring a 4–dimensional block world ontology.
Given quantum states, the properties of which are determined as far as possible by
using quantum ﬁeld measurements, it is of course possible to ask what the results of classical
measurements would be, as indeed we did above for the Dirac spinor–valued random ﬁeld, if
only we could make those classical measurements or if we could correct for whatever a classical
theory takes to be, from its perspective, the inadequacies of the quantum measurements[5].
From a classical perspective, we can take a presentation of what the results of such classical
measurements would be to constitute a diﬀerent way to work with the Poincar´e invariant
noise of the vacuum state. To brieﬂy address only two of very many contemporary issues:
• a classical perspective takes quantum computation and other exploitation of the
quantum-Hilbert space formalism to be a consequence of the measurement process, the
reduction of elaborate noisy classical states by the use of local and nonlocal observables
that have discrete spectra and incompatible eigenspaces, however this is only a matter
of interpretation, because the mathematical landscape provided by ﬁeld operators acting
on the vacuum sector Hilbert space is completely unchanged;
• the random ﬁelds of quantum non-demolition operators constructed here make it possible
to discuss the violation of Bell inequalities by random ﬁelds and by quantum ﬁelds
in a uniﬁed way, which is somewhat anticipated in [25, §6], insofar as any quantum
ﬁeld state is equivalent to a nonlocally correlated, noisy, but nonetheless eﬀectively
superdetermined classical random ﬁeld state, however antilocality of the propagators
involved[26, 27], microcausality, and noncommutativity of the algebra of observables[28]
must also be considered.
Particularly for the quantized Dirac spinor ﬁeld, however, the projective quality of many
measurements limits how closely we might determine a putative underlying classical state,
so that we may well be best to discuss quantum measurements as about quantum states,
with only a background acknowledgment that perhaps there are classical random ﬁelds
underpinning all this, or perhaps there are not, with no prejudicial determination either way.
From a practical point of view, the Correspondence Principle is so embedded in physicists’
thinking that it will be best to keep thinking in terms of both quantum ﬁelds and random
ﬁelds.
Finally, the focus on the space of test functions and its pre–inner product structure is
very much aimed towards future consideration of interacting quantum or random ﬁelds in test
function algebraic terms, insofar as products and derivatives of test functions are always well–
deﬁned, steps towards which may be found in [29], in contrast to using renormalization to ﬁx
the problems introduced by deﬁning a Lagrangian evolution using products of distributions.
For free quantum ﬁelds, expected values for quantum ﬁeld operators depend linearly on the
modulation that is applied to the vacuum.
From a signal analysis perspective, that is a
convenience more than a necessity, surely not deﬁnite enough for it to be enshrined in axioms
(as it is directly by the Wightman axioms, by requiring quantum ﬁelds to be distributions, but
only indirectly by the Haag-Kastler axioms, through additivity). Response to modulations is

Classical states, quantum ﬁeld measurement
15
in general not linear in physics (except as a ﬁrst approximation or because we engineer the
response to be linear over as large a range as we can.) Thus, we might usefully introduce
nonlinear dependence on test functions (which is well-deﬁned) instead of introducing powers
of distributions as interaction terms (which is not). If we take the renormalization scale that
is required to construct interacting theories to be ﬁxed by or at least to be correlated with
parameters of the test functions used in detailed models of an experiment, then interacting
theories are already weakly nonlinearly dependent on the test functions.
Better understanding the relationship between random and quantum ﬁelds,
by
isomorphisms as well as by quantization, allows us more to apply a classical intuition to
the construction of interacting ﬁeld theories.
For example, when thinking classically an
introduction of a Dirac spinor ﬁeld could be understood to be a way to model dispersion,
nonlinearity, and constraints of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, not necessarily as a new particle, or
else we could eliminate the electromagnetic ﬁeld; ideas are more ﬂuid in the classical setting.
Even though we can’t work classically with complete freedom, because there are isomorphisms
only for some quantum ﬁeld models, nonetheless the limits of when classical intuition might
be useful are well-deﬁned by what isomorphisms we can construct.

Appendix A. Classical mechanics to quantum mechanics: Koopman–von
Neumann
We can present Classical Mechanics as a commutative, associative algebra A of observables
over a phase space, A : P →R; P 7→A(P), with a multiplication ·:A×A→A; A, B 7→A · B,
together with a Poisson bracket, {•, •}:A×A→A : A, B 7→{A, B}, and a Hamiltonian H(P)
that generates, for an observable A(P, t), an evolution dA
dt = {H, A} + ∂A
∂t . [We can present
Classical Mechanics equivalently, with considerably more elaborate machinery, using the Peierls
bracket over the solution space instead of using the Poisson bracket over phase space[30, §4.4.1],
however this Appendix will use the simpler machinery of phase space.] The algebra of classical
observables is not a simple commutative algebra.
We can use the multiplication · to construct an action
ˆYA : A →A; • 7→ˆYA(•) = A · •,
where we can identify the algebra generated by the ˆYA with A, and we can similarly use the
Poisson bracket to construct what can be called generators of transformations,
ˆZA : A →A; • 7→ˆZA(•) = {A, •},
which act noncommutatively but associatively on A [1, 7],[19](§§2.1.1, 5.5.1),[31](§§1.5-6),[32,
33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. These two actions allow us to construct a noncommutative,
associative algebra A+ that is generated by the ˆYA and the ˆZA, satisfying the commutation
relations [ ˆYA, ˆYB] = 0, [ ˆZA, ˆYB] = ˆY{A,B}, and [ ˆZA, ˆZB] = ˆZ{A,B}. The linear space of operators

Classical states, quantum ﬁeld measurement
16
generated by the ˆYA supports an adjoint action of the Lie algebra generated by the ˆZA. Note
that this algebra of operators has always been implicitly part of a Hamiltonian presentation
of classical mechanics, even though it has been explicitly presented by the Poisson bracket. If
the phase space is elementary, for a dynamics that is either without constraints or for which
all constraints are implemented by the Hamiltonian, A+ is generated by qi, pi, ∂/∂qi, and
∂/∂pi.
The above is all just Classical Mechanics. To move towards Quantum Mechanics, we
introduce raising and lowering operators for the elementary case,

which, when taken with ( ˆW ˆX)†= ˆX† ˆW †, deﬁne an involution ˆX7→ˆX†, making A+ a ∗–algebra
over R (that is, we allow only real scalar multiples). The raising and lowering operators satisfy
the commutation relations [ai, a†
j] = δij, [bi, b†
j] = δij, and [ai, aj]=[ai, bj]=[bi, bj]=[ai, b†
j]=0.
If we set ρ(1) = 1 and
ρ( ˆXai) = ρ( ˆXbi) = ρ(a†
i ˆX) = ρ(b†
i ˆX) = 0
∀ˆX ∈A+,
then we obtain by the usual manipulations a Gaussian statistical state[17, §III.2.2] over
A+, ρ : A+ →C, which is a complex linear form that satisﬁes ρ( ˆX† ˆX) ≥0, ρ(1) = 1, and
ρ( ˆX†) = ρ( ˆX), which allows a probability interpretation for those operators for which ˆX† = ˆX
(which we can therefore call “observables”), and which allows the GNS-construction[17,
§III.2.2] of a Hilbert space H+.
The presence or otherwise of a natural complex structure makes a diﬀerence[33]. H+ as
a vector space can be generated by a basis that contains a vacuum vector |0⟩and real–valued

structure —which for a random ﬁeld can be provided, as in Section 2, by the cosine and
sine components of the fourier transform relative to space–time coordinates— are equivalent

we introduce an engineering imaginary j for the purposes of signal processing (though it is
not necessary if we restrict ourselves to using fourier sine and cosine transforms) then each
qi, j∂/∂qi and pi, j∂/∂pi pair allows the construction of a Wigner or other quasi–probability
distribution, using the mathematics and classical measurement theory associated with time–
frequency distributions[15] as qi–qifrequency distributions.
The positive deﬁnite Hamiltonian function for a collection of non-interacting simple
harmonic oscillators, in a vector notation, with q = (q1, q2, ...) and p = (p1, p2, ...), is
H(q, p) =
1
2(q · q + p · p), from which we obtain two operators, using a and b as vectors
of raising and lowering operators, as we did for q and p,

which are Hermitian and anti–Hermitian respectively. Classical physics requires only that
ˆYH is bounded below, not that ˆZH is positive. ˆZH generates time–like translations; given a
complex structure j, we can transform to the basis c = (a+jb)/

ˆZH = j ˆHc, where ˆHc = c† · c −d† · d, so that from the perspective of quantum mechanics
the Hamiltonian operator ˆHc is not positive–deﬁnite (however we see in the main text that
we can transform negative frequency components into positive frequency components for at
least some random ﬁeld constructions; for an example of the appearance of this operator as
a generator of time–like translations in quantum optics, see [5, Eq. (12)]). The construction
of the involution and state above is notable, however, for ﬁxing statistics directly instead of
assuming or requiring that a Hamiltonian or a stochastic dynamics is available to deﬁne, for
example, a Gibbs state. We have become accustomed to presenting classical physics using a
Lagrangian or Hamiltonian, however we can in a stochastic context present classical physics
using a state over an abstract ∗–algebra of observables.
The whole process here is an algebraic form of a Koopman–von Neumann approach,
having four steps:
(1) use the injection P : A ֒→A+; (2) introduce an involution
ˆX7→ˆX†, making A+ a ∗–algebra; (3) introduce a statistical state over A+; (4) use the
GNS-construction of the Hilbert space H+.
Only (2) and (3) need the introduction of
new structure, an involution and a state, for either of which there may be obstructions
for more elaborate phase spaces; (1) and (4) use structure that’s already there. It is clear
that this Koopman–von Neumann approach is quite diﬀerent from canonical quantization,
a map that is not an algebra morphism that for elementary cases can be presented as
Q : A →A′ ⊂A+; (qi, pi) 7→(qi, −i∂/∂qi). At the level of quantum ﬁeld theory, this should
cause little concern, insofar as the choice of a classical ﬁeld theory to quantize is rather
instrumental: we choose a classical ﬁeld to quantize that gives by quantization a quantum
ﬁeld that is empirically successful. As an instrumental process, if there is an empirically
successful quantum ﬁeld that is the result of a Koopman–von Neumann treatment of some
classical ﬁeld, we can choose to use that classical ﬁeld; [2] (and Appendix B) and Section 2
eﬀectively show that there is such a classical ﬁeld for the quantized complex Klein-Gordon
ﬁeld and for the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld, respectively.
Appendix B. The complex Klein-Gordon ﬁeld
To emphasize the similarity between the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld and the complex
Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld, instead of relying on the nonunique and rather dissimilar
construction in [2], we can present the complex Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld as ˆFf = af∗+a†
f =
ˆφf1 + ˆφ†
f∗
2 , where f =

f1
f2

is a two component test function, f ∗=

f∗

f∗

ensures that ˆF†
f = ˆFf∗,
and the raising and lowering operators satisfy [af, a†
g] = (f, g)+, with the pre–inner product
(f, g)± =

For this quantum ﬁeld, we can use the matrix I =
  0 1
−1 0

in the same way as the Hodge
dual was used for the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld in Section 2 to construct an involution
• : S →S; f 7→f • = 1
2(1 + iI)f + 1
2(1 −iI)f −, f •• = f, so that (because as for the quantized
electromagnetic ﬁeld we have the identities (f ∗, g∗)± = (g, f)∓and (f −, g−)± = (f, g)∓) we
can derive (f ∗•, g•)± = (g∗•, f •)±, and hence we can construct a random ﬁeld ˆFf = af∗• + a†
f•
for which [ˆFf, ˆFg] = 0.

Appendix C. The electromagnetic potential
The electromagnetic potential does not “play nice” with the helicity projection used in the
main text.
For the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld, we have ⟨0| ˆF†
f ˆFg |0⟩= (f, g)+ = ((δf, δg))+, where
for 1–forms u and v we have the sesquilinear forms
((u, v))± = −ℏ
Z
˜u∗(k)·˜v(k)2πδ(k·k)θ(±k0) d4k
(2π)4,
which are not positive semi–deﬁnite in general but are positive semi–deﬁnite for ((δf, δg))±.
We have, therefore, for arbitrary 3–forms u(3) and 1–forms u(1),
⟨0| ˆFfˆFδu(3) |0⟩= ((δf∗, δδu(3)))+ = 0
⇒ˆFδu(3) ≡0 ⇒dˆF ≡0;
⟨0| ˆFfˆFdu(1) |0⟩= ((δf∗, δdu(1)))+ = ((δf∗, (δd + dδ)u(1)))+ = 0 ⇒ˆFdu(1) ≡0 ⇒δˆF ≡0
(because ((δf∗, dv))± = 0 ∀v, and for the other term because of projection to the light-cone);
and ⟨0| ˆFfˆFg |0⟩= ⟨0| ˆFfˆFg(+) |0⟩⇒ˆFg ≡ˆFg(+), where g
g(±)(k) = ˜g(k)θ(±k),
so we can write ˆA as a potential for ˆF, ˆF = dˆA, ˆFf = ˆAδf, and we have ⟨0| ˆAuˆAv |0⟩= ((u∗, v))+,
albeit problematically because ((u, v))+ is not a pre–inner product.
For a random ﬁeld operator ˆFf, we have, using P± = 1
2(1 ± i⋆) for brevity and clarity,
⟨0| ˆFf ˆFg |0⟩= ((δP+f∗, δP+g))+ + ((δP−f∗, δP−g))−,
then, using δP±δ = ±1
2iδ ⋆δ = ±1
2iδd⋆(when acting on 3–forms) and δP±d = 1
2δd,
⟨0| ˆFfˆFδu(3) |0⟩= i
2((δP+f∗, δd ⋆u(3)))+ −i
2((δP−f∗, δd ⋆u(3)))−= 0 ⇒dˆF ≡0;
⟨0| ˆFfˆFdu(1) |0⟩=
1
2((δP+f∗, δdu(1)))+ + 1
2((δP−f∗, δdu(1)))−= 0
⇒δˆF ≡0;
so ˆF still satisﬁes the Maxwell equations, however the projection to positive frequency becomes
⟨0| ˆFf ˆFg |0⟩= ⟨0| ˆFf ˆFP+g(+)+P−g(−) |0⟩
⇒
ˆFg ≡ˆFP+g(+)+P−g(−).
Because of the Hodge dual in this construction, to construct a potential for ˆF we have to
introduce both a 1–form ˆA and a 3–form ˆB, setting ˆF = dˆA + δˆB so that ˆFf = ˆAδf + ˆBdf.
Deﬁning ˆXu(1)⊕u(3) = ˆAu(1) + ˆBu(3), we have ˆFf = ˆXδf⊕df. If we write
⟨0| ˆXu(1)⊕u(3) ˆXv(1)⊕v(3) |0⟩
= (( 1
2(u∗
(1) −i⋆u∗
(3)), 1
2(v(1) −i⋆v(3))))+ + (( 1
2(u∗
(1) + i⋆u∗
(3)), 1
2(v(1) + i⋆v(3))))−,
then, using that d⋆= −⋆δ when acting on 2–forms,
⟨0| ˆFfˆFg |0⟩= (( 1
2(δf∗−i⋆df∗), 1
2(δf∗−i⋆df∗)))+ + (( 1
2(δf∗+ i⋆df∗), 1
2(δf∗+ i⋆df∗)))−
= (( 1
2(δf∗+ iδ⋆f∗), 1
2(δf∗+ iδ⋆f∗)))+ + (( 1
2(δf∗−iδ⋆f∗), 1
2(δf∗−iδ⋆f∗)))−
= ((δP+f∗, δP+g))+ + ((δP−f∗, δP−g))−.
We could, for the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld, have set ˆF = dˆA + δˆB, so that
ˆF = ˆAδf + ˆBdf = ˆXδf⊕df, in which case to ensure that ⟨0| ˆF†
f ˆFg |0⟩= ((δf, δg))+ we would
have to set ⟨0| ˆXu(1)⊕u(3) ˆXv(1)⊕v(3) |0⟩= ((u∗
(1), v(1)))+, which has the eﬀect that ˆB ≡0. The
constructions of potentials for ˆF and ˆF, as for the constructions in Section 2, have the same
number of eﬀective degrees of freedom, however with projections to diﬀerent linear subspaces.

Appendix D. Calculating fermionic VEVs
It is worth showing brieﬂy how the calculation of fermionic VEVs proceeds eﬃciently. We
ﬁrst choose (part of) an orthogonal basis, then manipulate objects that are either orthogonal
or parallel. For ⟨0| ˆψ†
W ˆψV ˆψ†
A ˆψB ˆψ†
V ˆψW |0⟩, with V and W orthogonal, we choose V and W
as a partial basis (if they were not orthogonal, we would ﬁrst Gram-Schmidt orthogonalize),
then write A = A⊥V ⊥W + A∥V + A∥W, where A∥V = A −A⊥V is the component of A
parallel to V , and similarly for B. Only three and then two terms of the nine terms in the
expansion of ˆψ†
A ˆψB survive,
⟨0| ˆψ†
W ˆψV ˆψ†
A ˆψB ˆψ†
V ˆψW |0⟩= ⟨0| ˆψ†
W ˆψV ˆψ†
A⊥V ⊥W ˆψB⊥V ⊥W ˆψ†
V ˆψW |0⟩
+ ⟨0| ˆψ†
W ˆψV ˆψ†
A∥V ˆψB∥V ˆψ†
V ˆψW |0⟩
+ ⟨0| ˆψ†
W ˆψV ˆψ†
A∥W ˆψB∥W ˆψ†
V ˆψW |0⟩
=
h
(A⊥V ⊥W, B⊥V ⊥W)+ + (A∥V, B∥V )
i
⟨0| ˆψ†
W ˆψV ˆψ†
V ˆψW |0⟩,
where the ˆψ†
A∥W ˆψB∥W term vanishes because { ˆψV , ˆψ†
A∥W} = 0 and ˆψ†
W ˆψ†
A∥W = 0.
Note
especially that factors move outside the vacuum state evaluation with or without a projection
to positive frequency, (·, ·)+ or (·, ·), depending respectively on whether they are orthogonal
to all other factors or a linear multiple of some other factor. The two pre–inner products on
(the inﬁnite–dimensional) test function space are, as always, crucial.
