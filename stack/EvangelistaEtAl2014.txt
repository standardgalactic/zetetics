Although it is widely accepted that honeybees use the polarized-light pattern
of the sky as a compass for navigation, there is little direct evidence that this
information is actually sensed during flight. Here, we ask whether flying
bees can obtain compass cues derived purely from polarized light, and com-
municate this information to their nest-mates through the ‘waggle dance’.
Bees, from an observation hive with vertically oriented honeycombs, were
trained to fly to a food source at the end of a tunnel, which provided overhead
illumination that was polarized either parallel to the axis of the tunnel, or per-
pendicular to it. When the illumination was transversely polarized, bees
danced in a predominantly vertical direction with waggles occurring equally
frequently in the upward or the downward direction. They were thus using the
polarized-light information to signal the two possible directions in which they
could have flown in natural outdoor flight: either directly towards the sun, or
directly away from it. When the illumination was axially polarized, the bees
danced in a predominantly horizontal direction with waggles directed either
to the left or the right, indicating that they could have flown in an azimuthal
direction that was 908 to the right or to the left of the sun, respectively.
When the first half of the tunnel provided axial illumination and the second
half transverse illumination, bees danced along all of the four principal diag-
onal directions, which represent four equally likely locations of the food source
based on the polarized-light information that they had acquired during their
journey. We conclude that flying bees are capable of obtaining and signalling
compass information that is derived purely from polarized light. Furthermore,
they deal with the directional ambiguity that is inherent in polarized light by
signalling all of the possible locations of the food source in their dances, thus
maximizing the chances of recruitment to it.
1. Introduction
Over the past five decades, considerable effort has been devoted to understanding
the strategies and visual cues that honeybees use to navigate to food sources, and
to uncovering the underlying mechanisms. We now know that bees are not only
capable of estimating the distance and the direction of an attractive food source,
but also of communicating this information to their nest-mates, through the
famous ‘waggle dance’ [1]. In the waggle dance, which is performed on the ver-
tical surface of a honeycomb, bees indicate the azimuthal direction of the food
source relative to the azimuth of the sun as the angle between the vertical and
the direction of the axis of the waggle. The sun is used as a reference in the
bee’s internal compass. Thus, a dance with a waggle axis oriented 308 clockwise
with respect to the vertical implies that the food source is positioned along a direc-
tion that is oriented 308 clockwise with respect to the sun’s azimuth. As the day
advances, the sun changes its azimuthal position in the sky. Consequently,
when a bee flies regularly to and from a given food source through the day, the
direction of the waggle axis changes systematically as the sun marches across
the sky. When the sun is obscured by a cloud, it is believed that bees are still

able to obtain a compass reference from the unoccluded part of
the sky, by making use of the pattern of polarization that the
sun creates in the sky [2,3].
Rayleigh scattering of sunlight by the Earth’s atmosphere
causes the sun to produce a characteristic pattern of polariz-
ation in the sky [3], as shown in figures 2 and 3. If the sun is
imagined to be at the pole of the celestial sphere, the e-vectors
of the polarized-light pattern in the sky are oriented parallel
to the lines of latitude of the sphere, and the degree of polariz-
ation of the light is strongest at the equator. Thus, when the sun
is near the horizon but obscured by a patch of cloud, the degree
of polarization in the sky will be strongest at the zenith, and, if
that part of the sky is visible, then a bee can make use of the
direction of the e-vector in that region to infer its direction of
flight. Flight in a direction perpendicular to the e-vector must
mean that the bee is heading directly towards the sun, or
directly away from it. On the other hand, flight in a direction
parallel to the e-vector must mean that the sun is directly to
the left or to the right of the bee, i.e. that the bee is flying
at an azimuthal direction that is oriented 908 away, either
clockwise or counterclockwise, from the direction of the sun.
There is considerable evidence that bees have the capacity to
sense the direction of the e-vectors in the celestial polarization
pattern [1,4–9]. The photoreceptors in the dorsal rim area of
the honeybee’s compound eyes exhibit a strong sensitivity to
polarized light [10,11]. Moreover, polarization-sensitive inter-
neurons have been found in the medulla [12], suggesting that
the polarization pattern in the sky may indeed be analysed by
the brain. However, these observations do not, on their own,
demonstrate that bees perceive the polarization pattern of the
sky and use it to measure or set their flight course. The requisite
proof must come from a behavioural experiment.
To our knowledge, there is so far only one study that has
examined whether flying bees can use information based
purely on the e-vector pattern of the overhead illumination,
to navigate to food sources. Kraft et al. [13] showed that bees
can be trained to navigate a four-armed maze by learning
routes in which the direction of polarization of the overhead
illumination remained constant. However, that study did
not explore whether or how this navigational information is
transmitted to other bees.
The lack of direct evidence that bees use information on
the polarization of light to gauge and signal the position of
a food source to their nest-mates is not surprising, given
the technical difficulties of creating and presenting artificially
polarized celestial patterns to freely flying, foraging bees. The
question is an important one that needs to be tackled.
Here, we address this question by training bees to fly
along a short, narrow tunnel to a food reward, and recording
their dances when they return to the hive. Earlier studies
have shown that flight in such tunnels can simulate consider-
ably longer flights outdoors, because of the relatively large
magnitude of optic flow that they induce in the bees’ eyes,
when compared with outdoor flight in a normal environment
[14–16]. It is well established that distances and directions
to food sources are determined only on the outbound
journey, and not during the homeward flight [1,17–19]. By
recording changes in the dances of the returning bees when
the polarized-light pattern in the ceiling of the tunnel is
artificially manipulated, we are able to show, clearly and con-
clusively, that bees are indeed capable of using the e-vector
pattern in the sky to measure the direction of their flight to
the food source and report it in their dances.
We also find that the bees indicate more than one direction
for the food source in their dances, demonstrating that they
take into account all of the ambiguities that are associated
with inferring flight directions on the basis of the e-vector pat-
tern alone. Depending upon the experimental situation, a bee
can signal up to four possible directions of the food source in
a single dance.
2. Material and methods
The experiments were conducted at a location in the Southern
Hemisphere (Brisbane, Australia). Individually marked bees
(Apis mellifera, L.) were trained to fly from an observation hive
into a tunnel of a circular cross section, 12 m long and 23 cm in
inside diameter, to forage from a sugar water feeder placed at
the far end. The inside of the tunnel was lined with a black-
white checkerboard texture, of check size 2.5 cm. The tunnel was
positioned directly in front of the hive entrance, pointing approxi-
mately towards the north (in exact terms, 78 east of magnetic north
and 188 east of true north). Thus, bees flew approximately north-
ward towards the food inside the tunnel, as shown in figure 1.
The distance from the hive entrance to the tunnel entrance was
175 cm. Therefore, the dominant portion of the flight to and
from the food occurred within the tunnel.
An 11 cm wide dorsal section of the tunnel was open to the
sky, throughout its length. Depending upon the experiment, this
open section was covered either with an insect-screen mesh to
retain the bees in the tunnel on their way to the feeder, or with
UV-transmitting polarization filters (HN22 linearly polarizing
filter, Polaroid) placed under a sheet of diffusing paper. When
flying under the mesh, bees were able to see the open sky. For a
bee flying along the axis of the tunnel, the overhead opening
would have subtended a vertical angle of ca 538. When flying
under the filters, the bees were exposed only to an artificially polar-
ized light stimulus. The diffusing paper above the polarizers
removed any polarization in the light incident on the tunnel
before it reached the polarization filters. It also eliminated any
view of the sun or other overhead landmarks. The polarization fil-
ters could be oriented so as to make the e-vector of the overhead
illumination either parallel to the long axis of the tunnel (hereafter
referred to as axial polarization) or perpendicular to the long axis
(hereafter referred to as transverse polarization).
Four experiments were carried out, each with a fresh group of
individually marked bees. In Experiment 1, bees were trained to
fly through the tunnel with a view of the sky—the top of the
tunnel wascoveredwiththeinsectscreenmesh.Basedonthegeome-
try of the tunnel, the width of the dorsal opening, and the trajectory
of the sun on the dates that the experiments were conducted we esti-
mate that, on a clear day, the sun would have been directly visible
to a bee flying along the axis of the tunnel, for about 3.5 h
(ca 9.20–12.45). In Experiment 2, the entire length of the tunnel pro-
vided transverse polarization. In Experiment 3, the entire length of
the tunnel provided axial polarization. In Experiment 4, the first
half of the tunnel (the first 6 m) provided transverse polarization,
whereas the second half provided axial polarization.
Dances of marked bees returning from the feeder were video-
filmed on both sides of the observation hive at 25 frames per
second using two Canon MV920 video cameras. For each of
the four experiments, the video was played back, frame by
frame, to measure the direction of the waggle axis, using an elec-
tronic protractor (Trilithon Software Inc.). Since flight through
the narrow tunnel simulated a much longer flight outdoors
[14–16], the waggle durations were long enough (typically of
the order of 230 ms) to enable the direction of the waggle axis
to be measured with a precision of 58.
In the case of Experiment 1 (flight with view of the sky), the
expected direction of the waggle axis for each dance was

obtained from knowledge of the orientation of the tunnel (188
east of true north), and of the sun’s azimuth at the time of record-
ing of the dance. The sun’s azimuth was obtained from tables
available on the Internet (US Naval Observatory, Washington,
DC, USA, http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/AltAz.php) for
the time of the day, the day of the year and the latitude and longi-
tude of the experimental site in Brisbane. The expected direction
of the waggle axis was thus the azimuthal angle between the sun
and the tunnel direction, measured eastward from the sun to the
tunnel direction. This angle was plotted counterclockwise from
the vertically upward direction in the plane of the honeycomb
and is shown as the thick broken line in the plots of figure 1
(green in the online version). Dances were recorded throughout
the day, and dance data were analysed separately for a series of
short time windows (each typically 10–30 min in duration) by
pooling data within each window. For each time window, the
solar azimuth was taken to be that prevailing at the mid-point of
that window.
Waggle durations were also measured for each of the four
experiments by stepping though the dances frame by frame,
counting the number of frames during which the waggle
occurred, and multiplying this number by the inter-frame
interval (40 ms).
Figure 1. (Overleaf.) Results of Experiment 1, in which bees flew in a tunnel with a view of the natural sky over a period of 1 day (13 March 2008) with the sun at
various positions as shown in (a). The tunnel pointed in a direction 188 east of true North. The panels show orientation histograms of the waggle axes obtained on
this day at various times of the day: (b) 7.56–9.09, (c) 9.15–9.30, (d) 10.47–11.10, (e) 11.10–11.20, ( f ) 12.41–12.46, (g) 14.13–14.25 and (h) 15.20–16.15.
In each panel, the thin lines (blue in the online version) depict the dance orientation histogram. The thick continuous line (red in the online version) shows the
mean dance vector. For clarity, the mean dance vector is shown as 6 the actual length. Thus, the maximum possible length of the mean vector as shown here
would be 6.0, rather than 1.0. The thick broken line (green in the online version) denotes the dance direction expected at that particular time of day, calculated as
described in §2. These values are 145.08, 136.08, 103.68, 96.28, 42.88, 11.78 and –4.78, respectively in (b) through (h), the angles being defined as positive
counterclockwise with respect to the rightward horizontal direction. The length of this line has no significance, but it is shown equal to the length of the thick line
to facilitate comparison of their directions. In this and subsequent figures each panel shows the magnitude (R) and direction (u) of the mean vector calculated as
described in §2, and the number of bees, number of dances and number of waggles analysed. (Online version in colour.)

(a) Data analysis
Polar histograms of the distribution of waggle axis orientations,
accumulated over several dances and several bees, were plotted
using 58 bins. The value in each bin represents the number of
waggle phases whose orientation was within +2.58 of the mean
orientation represented by that bin. For simplicity, we refer to the
number of waggle phases analysed in each experiment as the
number of waggles. These numbers, as well as the number of
dances analysed and the number of bees involved are specified in
the panels of figures 1–3 and 6 and electronic supplementary
material,figureS2.Inthecaseswherethenumberofdancesisgreater
than the number of bees, some bees contributed more than one
dance to the analysis.
In Experiment 1, the mean dance vector for each histogram was
calculated as the vector sum of the waggle counts in the individual
directional bins, divided by the sum of all of the counts, as described
by Batschelet [20]. The result was a vector whose direction rep-
resented the mean direction of the waggle axis, and whose length
was an inverse measure of the scatter of the data about this mean
direction. A mean dance vector of length 1.0 implied that all of the
individually measured waggle axis directions were in exactly the
same direction, i.e. that there was no scatter. On the other hand, a
mean dance vector of length 0.0 implied that the waggle axes were
distributeduniformlyinalldirections,i.e. that therewas no tendency
for the bees to dance in any particular direction. The Rayleigh test
[20, pp. 54–58] was used to test whether the mean dance vector
was significantly different from zero, i.e. to examine whether there
was a significant tendency for the bees to dance in a particular direc-
tion, rather than in a randomly oriented fashion. The V test [20,
pp. 58–60] was used to test the hypothesis that the dance directions
were significantly different from random and were clustered around
the dance direction expected on the basis of the sun’s azimuth.
In Experiments 2 and 3, the direction of the waggle axis was cal-
culated by taking into account the observed mirror symmetry in the
dance directions (up versus down in figure 2, and left versus right in
figure 3). This was accomplished by computing the mean dance
vector after doubling the measured waggle axis angles, then halving
the angle of the resulting vector and plotting the result as an axis
oriented along this direction and the diametrically opposite direc-
tion. This procedure is described by Batschelet [20, pp. 21–29].
In Experiment 4, the modal directions of the waggle axes were
calculated by taking into account the observed fourfold mirror
symmetry in the dance directions (458, 1358, 2258 and 3158 in
figure 4). This was accomplished by computing the mean dance
vector after quadrupling the measured waggle axis angles, and
then taking one-quarter of the angle of the resulting mean vector
and plotting the mean preferred directions as axes oriented along
this direction, as well as three other directions oriented at 908,
1808 and 2708 to the direction. This procedure for analysing period-
ically arranged, multimodal peaks in orientation distributions is
described by Batschelet [20, pp. 21–30].
In Experiments 2–4, the statistical significance of the preferred
dance directions was evaluated by applying the Rayleigh test to
the doubled angles (Experiments 2 and 3) or to the quadrupled
angles (Experiment 4), as described by Batschelet [20, pp. 20–30].
In analysing the distances indicated by the dancing bees in
Experiments 2–4, the waggle durations were measured for at
least 90 waggles under each experimental condition. The Stu-
dent’s t-test and single factor ANOVA were used to test for
statistically significant differences.

(13 March 2008), as described in §2. The tunnel pointed
approximately in the northern direction (or, more precisely,
188 east of true north) so that the sun was to the right of the
flight direction in the morning and to the left in the afternoon
(figure 1). The bees display a mean dance direction that is
shifted counterclockwise with respect to the vertical in the
morning, and clockwise in the afternoon. As the sun’s azimuth
shifts progressively from east to west through the day, the
mean dance vector rotates progressively in the clockwise direc-
tion, commencing with an early-morning direction that is
oriented nearly 908 counterclockwise from vertical, and finish-
ing with a late-afternoon direction that is oriented nearly 908
clockwise from vertical (figure 1). At each of the time windows
(figure 1b–h), the mean dance vector is significantly different
from zero in magnitude (p , 0.001 in each case, Rayleigh
test), implying that the dances are not randomly oriented. Fur-
thermore, the mean dance direction is not significantly
different in direction from the direction that is expected at
that time ( p , 0.0001 in each case, V test). Similar results
were obtained when the experiment was repeated on another
day (21 April 2008; data not shown). These results indicate
that the bees flying in the open tunnel of Experiment 1 were
clearly able to use celestial cues to determine the direction of
their flight in the tunnel. However, this experiment does not
reveal what celestial cues the bees were using to determine
their flight direction. Potential cues could have been the pos-
ition of the sun, the pattern of polarization in the sky, as well
as gradients of intensity or colour that migrated with the sun
as it moved across the sky.
(b) Experiment 2
To examine whether bees use the pattern of polarization in
the sky as a cue to establish their flight direction, in Exper-
iment 2 the open section of the tunnel was covered with
polarization filters oriented so as to provide illumination
with the e-vector oriented transversely to the tunnel’s long
axis, as shown in figure 2a. Bees foraging in this tunnel dis-
played a striking and statistically significant tendency to
dance in a preferred direction—the dances were not ran-
domly oriented (R ¼ 0.42, p , 0.001, Rayleigh test). The
dances were directed predominantly upwards or down-
wards. Horizontally oriented dances (oriented either to the
left or the right) were very infrequent. The mean direction
of the dance axis was oriented 91.78 counterclockwise with
respect to the rightward horizontal direction (thick line,
figure 2c). This was very close to the vertical direction and
was not significantly different from it ( p , 0.0001, V test).
How do individual bees signal the direction of the food
source under these conditions? Detailed analysis of individual
dances revealed that some bees tended to orient their waggles
consistently in the downward direction (figure 4a), and others
predominantly in the upward direction (figure 4b). A third
group of bees signalled both directions within a single dance:
the waggle was directed upward in some loops and downward
in others (figure 4c,d).
(c) Experiment 3
In Experiment 3, the open section of the tunnel was covered
with polarization filters oriented so as to provide illumination
with the e-vector oriented parallel to the tunnel’s long axis, as
shown in figure 3a. Bees foraging in this tunnel again did not
orient their dances randomly, but displayed a strong and
statistically
significant
tendency
(R ¼ 0.50,
p , 0.001,
Rayleigh test) to direct their dances predominantly leftwards
or rightwards. Vertically oriented dances (oriented either
upwards or downwards) were very infrequent. The mean
direction of the dance axis was oriented 1.38 clockwise
with respect to the rightward horizontal direction (thick
line, figure 3c) and was not significantly different from it
( p , 0.0001, V test).
Detailed analysis of individual dances in this experi-
mental condition revealed a pattern that was analogous to
that observed in Experiment 2. Some bees tended to orient
their waggle consistently in the rightward direction (see
electronic supplementary material, figure S1a), others in the
leftward direction (see electronic supplementary material,
figure S1b), and a third group of bees signalled both direc-
tions within a single dance (see electronic supplementary
material, figure S1c,d).
(d) Influence of time of day when foraging under
constant, artificially polarized illumination
When the view of the sky was eliminated and the bees were
shown artificially polarized illumination, as in Experiments 2
and 3, the dance directions were not at all affected by the
time of day. With the transverse e-vector illumination,
the waggle dances were always oriented vertically (upwards
or downwards), regardless of the time of day. An example is
shown in figure 5, which compares orientation histograms
for dances measured between 12.55 and 13.14 (figure 5a),
and between 14.40 and 15.16 (figure 5b). In each case, the
mean dance orientation was very close to the vertical axis
(upwards or downwards), even though the mid-points of the
time windows during which the two sets of dances were
recorded (13.04 and 14.58, respectively) were separated by
nearly 2 h. If the bees were using the azimuthal position of
the sun to direct their dances at these times, their dance direc-
tions would be expected to be unimodal and oriented at 378
and 48 counterclockwise, respectively, relative to the rightward
horizontal direction.
With the axial e-vector illumination, the mean dance
orientation was very close to the horizontal axis (leftwards
or rightwards), regardless of the time of day. An example
is shown in the electronic supplementary material, figure S2,
which compares orientation histograms for dances measured
between 13.26 and 14.00 (see electronic supplementary
material, figure S2a) and between 13.59 and 14.51 (see elec-
tronic supplementary material, figure S2b). In each case, the
mean dance orientation was very close to the horizontal axis,
even though the mid-points of the time windows during
which the two sets of dances were recorded (13.43 and 14.26,
respectively) were separated by nearly three-quarters of an
hour. If the bees were using the azimuthal position of the sun
to direct their dances at these times, their dance directions
would be expected to be unimodal and oriented at 228 and
108 counterclockwise, respectively, relative to the rightward
horizontal direction.
These experiments also indicate that the bees’ dances
were not influenced by any artefactual ‘hot spot’ created by
the sun when viewed through the diffuser paper, or by any
brief glimpse of the sun before entering the tunnel: the
dances were influenced only by the direction of the polarized
illumination in the tunnel.

(e) Experiment 4
In Experiment 4, the e-vector illumination was transverse in
the first half of the tunnel and axial in the second half, as
shown in figure 6a. Bees foraging in this tunnel displayed
four preferred dance directions, as shown in figure 6c: (i) left-
ward and upward, (ii) rightward and upward, (iii) leftward
and
downward
and
(iv)
rightward
and
downward.
Relatively few dances were oriented in the horizontal or
the vertical directions. Statistical analysis of the data (as
described in §2) indicates that the orientations are not ran-
domly
distributed
( p , 0.001).
Analysis
of
the
dance
directions, carried out as described in §2, reveals four
modal directions, shown as the thick continuous lines (red
in online version). These are oriented at angles of 42.48,
132.48, 222.48 and 312.48, measured counterclockwise with
respect to the rightward horizontal axis. These directions are
very close to the four principal diagonal directions of 458,
1358, 2258 and 3158, shown as the thick broken lines (green in
online version). Statistical analysis (see §2) reveals that
the observed modal dance orientations are not signifi-
cantly different from the four principal diagonal directions
( p , 0.0001, V test).
Detailed analysis of the dances of individual bees reveals
that, at the level of the individual bee, the fourfold ambiguity
in direction is addressed in a manner similar to the twofold
ambiguity in Experiments 2 and 3. Some individuals tend to
signal a single direction (i.e. one of the four possible directions),
while others indicate several of the possible directions within a
single dance. Figure 7 shows data obtained from analysing four
different dances of an individual bee (bee no. 11) participating
in this experiment. Each panel shows the distribution of waggle
orientations recorded in a single dance. We see that the number
of distinct directions indicated in a single dance can vary from
three (figure 7c,d) to four (figure 7a,b). Electronic supplemen-
tary material, figure S3 shows four examples of single dances
from another individual (bee no. 55). Here again, we see that
an individual bee can signal anything from two (see electro-
nic supplementary material, figure S3a) up to four (see
electronic supplementary material, figure S3b–d) distinct
directions in a single dance.
The waggle dance of the honeybee signals not only the
apparent direction of the food source, but also the apparent
distance; the distance is proportional to the duration of the
waggle. What distances do the bees signal under the various
experimental conditions that we have explored? Figure 8
shows the results of three experiments in which we compared

the durations of waggle dances of bees that had returned
from a 12 m long tunnel illuminated with polarized light
that was oriented either axially (figure 8a), or transversely
(figure 8b), or transversely for the first 6 m and axially for
the final 6 m (figure 8c).
The mean waggle duration recorded with axial polariz-
ation (216.4+1.9 (s.e.) ms; 11 bees, 11 dances, 100 waggles)
is not significantly different from that recorded with trans-
verse polarization (234.4+8.3 (s.e.) ms; 17 bees, 17 dances,
102 waggles) (t-test, p ¼ 0.07). The average of these two dur-
ations is 227.3+6.4 ms. The waggle durations recorded in
each of these conditions are very similar to those recorded
for flights under the open sky in Experiment 1. Those dur-
ations, recorded on 13 March 2008, are: 191.9+ 20 (s.e.) ms
(9.15–9.30), 229.5+7.1 (s.e.) ms (10.47–11.10) and 236.9+
17.3 (s.e.) ms (11.10–11.20).
From the results of figure 6, it is clear that a bee having
flown through the tunnel with the e-vector illumination
transverse in the first half of the tunnel and axial in the
second half signals a direction of approximately 458, which
is in between these two directions. This suggests that by illu-
minating a straight tunnel with two successive, mutually
perpendicular e-vector directions we can simulate a flight
through an L-shaped tunnel consisting of two perpendicu-
larly oriented legs, each leg being half the total length.
When bees fly in a simulated L-shaped tunnel, do they indi-
cate a measure of the total distance flown (d), or the ‘shortcut’
(vector) distance (d/p2) to the food source as illustrated in
figure 8c? If they indicated the total distance, we would
expect the waggle duration to be approximately 227 ms; if
they indicated the vector distance, we would expect the
waggle duration to be in the vicinity of (227/p2) ¼ 160 ms.
The measured mean waggle duration in the simulated
L-shaped tunnel is 240.3+ 7.9 (s.e.) ms (12 bees, 12 dances,
94 waggles; figure 8d), which is significantly greater than
160 ms (t-test, p , 0.01), but close to the durations measured
in the ‘straight’ tunnels (one factor ANOVA, p ¼ 0.18). Thus,
in the simulated L-shaped tunnel the bees signal the total
distance flown, rather than the vector distance corresponding
to the imaginary shortcut.
The flight distances that these waggle durations would
represent in outdoor flight are approximately 300 m for the
distance to the food source in the straight tunnel and approxi-
mately 210 m for the vector distance to the food source in the
L-shaped tunnel. These estimates of equivalent outdoor flight
distances are obtained from calibrations of the honeybee’s
odometer as described in [16].
4. Discussion
The ability to use polarized light for navigation or orientation
has been demonstrated clearly and unequivocally in walking
animals such as the desert ant [21], the desert wood louse [22]
and the dung beetle [23,24]. This has been achieved by showing
that the direction of locomotion of a homing desert ant, or of a
dung beetle departing with its treasure, can be systematically
altered by changing the direction of the e-vector of the over-
head illumination. However, this ability has so far not been
demonstrated in honeybees—or, indeed, in any other airborne
animal—because of the obvious technical difficulties associ-
ated with varying the overhead illumination during flight
over large distances. This study has overcome this hurdle, at
least for honeybees, by using a tunnel to simulate a long jour-
ney, and manipulating the illumination in the tunnel.
Earlier studies have shown that the waggle dances of
bees returning from a food source can be systematically
altered by illuminating the hive with artificially polarized
light and varying the direction of polarization of this illumi-
nation [1,7]. These experiments are telling, in that they
demonstrate that bees can perceive and react to polarization
patterns, but such experiments are restricted to modifying
behaviour within the hive. They do not reveal whether bees
flying outdoors to a food source are able to gauge their
flight direction purely from the pattern of polarization that
is present in the sky.
Observations of the ability of animals to orient spon-
taneously to e-vector patterns have been documented in a
number of invertebrate species (e.g. locusts, shrimps, bees,
etc. [25]). In one series of experiments, Jacobs-Jessen [26]
showed that when foraging bees were captured and released
from a hole in the centre of a circular table, which was illumi-
nated from above with polarized light, the walking bees
oriented their body axes in four different preferred directions
relative to the e-vector of the illumination. While this exper-
iment suggests that bees have the capacity to sense the
direction of the e-vector, they do not indicate whether they
use this information to measure or set their direction of
flight when they fly towards a known food source. In another
series of experiments, Jacobs-Jessen [26] arranged for bees to
emerge from their hive through an aperture at the centre of a
circular table (as above), with a horizontal sheet of glass posi-
tioned just above the table. This encouraged the bees to walk,
rather than fly, to the periphery of the table before flying out
through a specific exit. There were exit holes all around the
periphery, but only one was open. He found that, when the
experiment was carried out under the open sky, the bees
learned to walk in the correct direction to find the exit hole.
This was true regardless of whether the sun was visible, or
screened off by a mask, allowing only a part of the remaining
blue sky to be visible. While this elegant experiment demon-
strates that the bees were using celestial cues to gauge and set
their walking direction, it does not reveal the nature of the
relevant cue—which could be the position of the sun, the
polarization pattern of the sky, the intensity or spectral gradi-
ents in the sky, or a combination of all of these cues.
Our experiments demonstrate that foraging bees can
sense and signal the direction of their flight by using infor-
mation that is based purely on the polarized-light pattern
of the sky. It should be noted, however, that the polarization
filters in our experiments provided a degree of polarization of
around 95%, whereas the degree of polarization of natural
skylight is somewhat lower, rarely exceeding 60% [2,27].
Experiment 1 has shown that bees can read a compass
direction and report it in their dances when they fly in a
tunnel under the open sky. However, this experiment on its
own does not tell us whether the compass information is
obtained from the sun, from the polarization pattern or
from the other cues listed above.
Experiments 2 and 3 address this question, by providing
overhead illumination that contains only polarized-light
cues. Here, bees can estimate their flight direction only
from the direction of the e-vector of the illumination. These
experiments show clearly that the direction of the waggle
axis in the honeybees’ dances can be manipulated by varying
the direction of the e-vector illumination in the tunnels. The

transverse e-vector illumination causes the bees to signal a
flight direction that is directly towards, or directly away,
from the sun, corresponding to the pattern of polarization
that they would experience when flying in either of these
directions under an open sky. The axial e-vector simulation,
on the other hand, causes the bees to signal a flight direction
that is 908 to the left or the right of the sun’s azimuth, which
again corresponds to the pattern of polarization that they
would experience when flying in either of these directions
under an open sky. These findings imply that the bees are
capable of gauging and signalling their heading direction
purely on the basis of the direction of the e-vector illumination
in the ceilings of the tunnels. How do bees deal with the 1808
directional ambiguity that is inherent in the polarized-light
stimulus? Analysis of the dances of individual bees under
these conditions reveals that some bees tend to prefer one
direction, others the opposite direction, and a third group of
bees signals both directions within a single dance (figure 4;
electronic supplementary material, figure S1). Thus, the
colony, as a whole, is provided with unbiased information
about both of the possible locations of the food source.
If this were to occur in reality, then one half of the bees
recruited by the dances would end up at the food source,
while the other half would not; but, in the absence of any
additional information, ‘unbiased reporting’ seems to be the
best way to deal with the ambiguity.
We have seen that when the view of the sky was eliminated
and the bees were shown artificially polarized illumination, as
in Experiments 2 and 3, the dance directions were not at all
affected by the time of day (figure 5; electronic supplementary
material, figure S2). On the other hand, changing the orientation
of the polarized illumination from axial (13.26–14.00, 30 April
2008; electronic supplementary material, figure S2) to trans-
verse soon thereafter (14.40–15.16 on the same day, figure 5)
caused the dance directions to change by approximately 908.
Similarly, changing the orientation of the polarized illumina-
tion from transverse (12.55–13.14, 1 May 2008; figure 5) to
axial soon thereafter (13.59–14.51 on the same day, electronic
supplementary material, figure S2) caused the dance directions
to change by approximately 908. Thus, in these experiments, the
dances depended only upon the direction of the e-vector of
the overhead illumination—they were not influenced by any
internal, clock-driven representation that the bees may have
possessed about the expected direction of the sun, or the
change in this direction with the time of day. That is, they
were not influenced by a learned ephemeris function (an
internal representation of how the azimuth of the sun should
vary with the time of day; cf. [28–30]). They were also not
affected by any brief glimpses of the sun that they might have
received prior to entering the tunnel.
In Experiment 4, the e-vector illumination was transverse
in the first half of the tunnel and axial in the second half.
Clearly, the bees interpreted the abrupt shift of the e-vector
direction in the middle of the tunnel as a 908 change in
their heading direction, even though they did not physically
execute a turn. Since flight in the first half could be inter-
preted as movement in a direction towards or away from
the sun, and flight in the second half as movement in a per-
pendicular direction (with the sun 908 to the left or the right
of the heading direction), the two sets of ambiguities lead to
four possible locations of the food source. They correspond
to (i) a flight towards the sun, followed by a turn to the
right; (ii) a flight towards the sun, followed by a turn to
the left; (iii) a flight away from the sun, followed by a turn
to the right and, finally, (iv) a flight away from the sun, fol-
lowed by a turn to the left. All of these four possible
locations are signalled by the bees (figure 6), and our findings
reveal that some bees signal all four locations in a single dance
(figure 7; electronic supplementary material, figure S3). This is
again a case of ‘unbiased reporting’ in response to the fourfold
ambiguity that the stimulus presents. However, the four peaks
in the distribution of dance orientations (figure 6) do not
have the same magnitude. The largest peaks are in the vicinity
of 1358 and 2258, followed by 458 and then 3158. The reason for
this non-uniformity is not clear. It is possible that small non-
uniformities in the ambient illumination of the observation
hive could have influenced the dance directions when the
extent of ambiguity about the location of the food source
became very large. It is well known that illumination of the
honeycomb by a punctate light source, simulating the sun,
can affect dance direction (see, for example, [7]). Another possi-
bility is that, in this condition of extreme ambiguity, the bees
were additionally influenced by a mechanism that used the
current position of the sun, as estimated by an internal clock,
or a brief glimpse of the sun before entering the tunnel, to
bias the dance orientations in favour of outdoor food sources
that they had previously visited, thus changing the frequencies
with which the four cardinal orientations are chosen. The use of
a learned ephemeris function by bees has been demonstrated in
many studies [29–31]. While our results with the purely trans-
verse and purely axial polarization argue against this possibility
(see figure 5 and the discussion thereof), one cannot exclude it
in the case of the dual polarization experiment which generates
an extreme, fourfold ambiguity that could promote the use of
other cues to attempt to resolve the ambiguity.
Direction information conveyed by bees that have flown a
path involving differently oriented segments has previously
been studied under more natural conditions. von Frisch [1]
trained foragers to fly around a mountain ridge, or a large
building or a forest edge separating the food source from
the hive. In their dances, the bees indicated a direction point-
ing straight towards the food source, a direction the bee had
actually never flown. A similar result was also obtained in a
more recent experiment where bees were trained to fly a route
that involved an outdoor leg followed by a leg through a
tunnel oriented at right angles [32]. In these experiments,
bees flew under a stationary celestial polarization pattern
and were forced to physically change their flight direction
when they entered the tunnel. In our experiments, on the
other hand, the bees flew in a straight line, under a polariz-
ation pattern whose orientation was changed by 908 half
way down the tunnel. Despite maintaining a constant flight
direction on their way to the food source, our bees interpreted
their journey as a flight through an L-shaped tunnel, as
revealed by the ‘shortcut’ direction that they indicated in
their dances. Thus, it appears that changes in flight direction
are sensed primarily in terms of changes in the orientation of
the overhead polarized light, when such cues are available.
While the bees signal the direction of the vector that speci-
fies the apparent location of the food source in Experiment 4,
they do not signal the length of this vector in their dances.
Rather, they signal the total distance travelled along the two
(seemingly perpendicular) legs. This finding is in good agree-
ment with earlier studies of distance estimates conveyed by
the waggle dance in other conditions where bees flew
around a hill [1], along an outdoor route and then through
rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 369: 20130037
10

a tunnel oriented at right angles [32] or along tunnels that
comprised a horizontal leg followed by a vertical leg [33].
In a foraging experience that is riddled with ambiguity, as
in Experiment 4, do different bees signal different locations
(with each individual displaying a preference for a particular
location), or does a given bee signal more than one location
in a single dance? The data in figure 7 and electronic sup-
plementary material, figure S3 suggest that both outcomes
are likely. While certain bees appear to display individual pre-
ferences, others behave as though they carry up to four
different representations of the location of the food source,
and can signal all of these locations simultaneously in a
single dance. It is not inconceivable that ambiguous, ‘multiple’
solutions arise even when bees forage in natural outdoor con-
ditions. For example, ambiguities of 1808 in flight direction
could arise when the sun is low on the horizon and obscured
by a hill or a cloud, so that the unoccluded part of the sky pro-
vides only e-vector information, but no cues on spectral or
intensity gradients. It would then be beneficial for a bee, return-
ing from an attractive food source, to signal all of the (equally)
likely positions of the targets in its dance, so that at least some
of the recruits arrive at the correct location. Signalling just one
of the possible locations (by arbitrary choice) would waste
colony resources, if this happened to be the wrong location.
Multimodal dance directions have previously been observed
in the presence of contradicting information, for example,
when the landscape is set in conflict with a learned ephemeris
function for the sun [31].
Results analogous to ours have recently been obtained by
Lebhardt et al. [34], who studied polarized-light-based navi-
gation of the desert ant Cataglyphis by training them to
walk to a food source in a tunnel that provided polarized
overhead illumination, and observed their trajectories when
they were allowed to return to their home in an open environ-
ment under the natural sky. When the entire length of the
tunnel provided a single direction of polarized light, the
ants’ homing directions displayed the same 1808 ambiguity
that we have observed in the dances of our bees, although
the ants showed a considerable preference for one direction
over the other (e.g. when homing they preferred to walk
towards the sun, rather than away from it, when the tunnel
presented transversely oriented polarized light). When the
tunnel offered two different directions of polarized light—one
direction in the first half and another direction in the second
half—the ants displayed a fourfold ambiguity in their home
runs, analogous to the fourfold ambiguity on the dance direc-
tions displayed by our bees. Like the bees, the ants showed a
preference for some of the homing directions, but with a stron-
ger bias, the reasons for which are not yet clear. Interestingly,
the lengths of the ants’ homing runs were shorter in the case
of the dual-polarizer experiments, compared with those in
which the orientation of the polarized light was constant over
the entire length of the tunnel, indicating that the ants were
computing the apparent vector distance (the ‘shortcut’ distance)
of the food source from their outbound journeys. By contrast,
our bees appear to compute the total distance travelled, rather
than the apparent vector distance. However, both animals
seem to compute the apparent vector direction of the food source.
Our results beg the question as to how ‘multiple’ sol-
utions as to the location of the food source are computed
and represented in the neural machinery of the brain. It has
been suggested that the so-called mushroom bodies in the
insect brain are structures that are analogous in function to
the hippocampus of the vertebrate brain [35]. Indeed, there
is some evidence for the existence of neurons in the mush-
room bodies that display responses similar to the ‘place’
neurons in the vertebrate hippocampus [36,37]. If this is the
case, then one possibility is that locations of food sources
are represented by target ‘place cells’. In the case of the
tunnel with the transverse e-vector illumination, for example,
the two possible locations of the food source would be rep-
resented by the firing of two place cells, one corresponding
to a location at the appropriate distance from the hive in the
direction of the sun, and the other to a location at the same
distance but in the opposite direction. The tunnel with the
axial e-vector illumination would lead to activity in two
other place cells, again representing two locations equidistant
from the hive, but which would be reached by flying in direc-
tions that are 908 to the left or the right of the sun. Extending
this logic one step further, the tunnel with transverse e-vector
illumination in the first half and axial e-vector illumination in
the second half would lead to activity in four different place
cells, each positioned at the vertex of a square and representing
a location of the food source along one of the diagonal direc-
tions. Whether this is indeed how the brain represents
ambiguous locations remains to be explored.
