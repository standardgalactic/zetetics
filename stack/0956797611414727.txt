Cultural psychological research has documented sizable cul-
tural variation in social explanation (Choi, Nisbett, & Noren-
zayan, 1999). Relative to European Americans, Asians are less 
likely to use another person’s personality traits in accounting 
for the person’s behavior. This cultural difference is consistent 
with a well-accepted two-stage model of person perception 
(Gilbert & Malone, 1995). This model proposes that when 
observing a behavior of another person, the social perceiver 
initially infers a trait from the behavior and then, in a second 
stage, deliberately adjusts the initial trait judgment by taking 
into account available situational constraints. Initial trait infer-
ence is held to be highly automatic and universal. However, 
because Asians are more attentive to situations or social  
contexts than European Americans are (Kitayama, Duffy, 
Kawamura, & Larsen, 2003; Masuda & Nisbett, 2001), Asians 
may be expected to dilute initial trait inferences more in 
explaining observed behavior. In this view, then, the initial 
trait inference may be expected to occur spontaneously in all 
cultures.
But is trait inference really spontaneous for Asians? Uleman, 
Carlston, Skowronski, and their colleagues have shown that 
upon observing another person’s behavior, individuals auto-
matically infer the corresponding trait (i.e., trait activation) 
and also automatically ascribe the trait to the actor (i.e., trait 
binding). At present, however, with only one important excep-
tion, this evidence has come exclusively from Western 
cultures (Carlston & Skowronski, 1994; Todorov & Uleman, 
2002, 2004; Van Duynslaeger, Sterken, Van Overwalle, &  
Verstraeten, 2008; Winter & Uleman, 1984).
According to Markus and Kitayama (1991, 2010), cultures 
vary in the model of the self they sanction. European Ameri-
can cultures emphasize a model of the self as independent. 
This model depicts behavior as internally motivated. Because 
people with such a model of the self may routinely engage in 
trait inference, spontaneous trait inference may be expected to 
have roots in the Western independent model of the self (Duff 
& Newman, 1997). In contrast, Asian cultures place a much 
greater emphasis on a contrasting model of the self as interde-
pendent. People with such a model of the self may not draw 
trait inferences on any regular basis because the interdepen-
dent model highlights situational constraints on the actor. 
Accordingly, for these individuals, trait inference may prove 
not to be spontaneous. Spontaneous trait inference, then, might 
be unique to the Western cultural context.

Spontaneous Trait Inference Is Culture-

Abstract
People with an independent model of the self may be expected to develop a spontaneous tendency to infer a personality 
trait from another person’s behavior, but those with an interdependent model of the self may not show such a tendency. 
We tested this prediction by assessing the cumulative effect of both trait activation and trait binding in a diagnostic task that 
required no trait inference. Participants first memorized pairings of facial photos with trait-implying behavior. In a subsequent 
lexical decision task, European Americans showed clear evidence of spontaneous trait inference: When they were primed 
with a previously studied face, lexical decision for the word for the implied trait associated with that face was facilitated, and 
the antonym of the implied trait elicited an electrophysiological sign associated with processing of semantically inconsistent 
information (i.e., the N400). As predicted, however, neither effect was observed for Asian Americans. The cultural difference 
was mediated by independent self-construal.

Na, Kitayama 
Zárate, Uleman, and Voils (2001) tested a similar prediction 
focusing on Latino Americans and European Americans. 
Because Latinos are less independent and more interdependent 
than European Americans, they may be less spontaneous in 
making trait inferences. In Study 1, Zárate et al. examined 
whether participants would infer corresponding traits when 
reading trait-implying behaviors and found some trend toward 
the predicted pattern. Although the cultural difference fell short 
of statistical significance, the task used in this study enabled the 
researchers to examine only the effect of trait activation. It is 
possible that the cultural difference would have been more pro-
nounced if the cumulative effect of both trait activation and trait 
binding had been tested.
In Study 2, Zárate et al. (2001) had participants memorize 
many pairings of faces with trait-implying behaviors. Subse-
quently, participants were shown each stimulus face and asked 
to rate the person on a few trait dimensions, one of which 
referred to the trait implied by the behavior paired with the face 
(see also Carlston & Skowronski, 2005). European Americans 
gave more extreme ratings on these implied traits than did 
Latino Americans. Although the researchers interpreted the 
result as consistent with the predicted cultural difference in 
spontaneous trait inference, this interpretation can be called into 
question because participants were explicitly asked to make trait 
judgments during the testing phase. This procedure makes it dif-
ficult to exclude the possibility that participants made the trait 
inferences on the basis of behaviors that they recalled during 
the testing phase (as opposed to the traits that had been inferred 
during the memorization phase).
At present, then, there remains a need to further investigate 
the predicted cultural difference in spontaneous trait inference. 
Finding that trait inference is not, in fact, spontaneous for indi-
viduals with Asian cultural heritage would pose a significant 
challenge to the current two-stage model of person perception. 
In the two studies reported here, we tested the predicted cross-
cultural difference by examining the cumulative effect of both 
trait activation and trait binding using a diagnostic task that 
required no trait judgment.
Study 1
In Study 1, we asked participants to memorize pairings of faces 
with trait-implying behaviors. Because participants were not 
asked to infer any traits, an association between an implied trait 
and the face with which it was paired during the memorization 
phase of the study would imply that the trait had been inferred 
(i.e., trait activation) and bound to the actor (i.e., trait binding) 
in a highly automatic fashion. To assess the magnitude of such 
associations, we used a lexical decision task with the faces as 
the priming stimuli. If an implied trait had been associated with 
a face, the face would activate that trait when presented during 
the lexical decision task and, thus, would facilitate lexical deci-
sion for that trait, as compared with lexical decision for a stimu-
lus word that was semantically unrelated to that trait. We 
predicted that the priming effect would be more pronounced for 
European Americans than for Asian Americans.
Participants and procedure
We tested 67 European American students (39 females, 28 
males) and 64 Asian American students (37 females and 27 
males) at the University of Michigan.
We prepared 20 Caucasian faces (10 females, 10 males), 20 
Asian faces (10 females, 10 males), and 40 behaviors.  
The behaviors were adopted from previous studies (Mitchell, 
Macrae, & Banaji, 2005; Uleman, 1987). A different group of 
participants (11 European Americans and 13 Asian Ameri-
cans) rated each of the 40 behaviors on the degree to which it 
implied a trait designated as “implied” by the behavior and a 
trait designated as “unrelated” to the behavior (1 = not imply-
ing at all, 7 = strongly implying). For both European and Asian 
Americans, the implied traits were judged as much more 
implied by the behaviors than the unrelated traits were (Ms = 
5.89 vs. 2.53), F(1, 22) = 228.38, p < .001, ηp
2 = .921.
Participants viewed the 20 stimulus faces that matched their 
own ethnicity, so that the ease of remembering the faces would 
be equated for the two groups of participants (see Hewstone, 
Rubin, & Willis, 2002, for a review of the in-group bias in face 
recognition). In previous studies, each face was typically paired 
with one behavior. To maximize the chance of observing trait 
inference, however, we paired each of the 20 faces with two dif-
ferent behaviors that implied the same trait, for a total of 40 
face-behavior pairings for each participant. For each ethnicity, 
two sets of face-behavior pairings were used.
During the first phase of the study, participants were pre-
sented with 40 face-behavior pairs and asked to memorize 
them. On each trial, a face was presented first on a computer 
screen. After 2 s, the paired behavior was added to the display 
on the screen. Both the face and the behavior remained on-
screen for an additional 4 or 7 s (i.e., total duration of 6 or 9 s 
for each face). This variation in presentation duration did not 
affect the results. After all pairs had been presented, a lexical 
decision task was given. Although it was presented as a filler 
task, it was actually designed to assess the magnitude of face-
trait associations. On each trial of the lexical decision task, 
1 of the 20 faces was first presented as a priming stimulus for 
1,500 ms. (Participants had been told that these faces were 
fixation points and were asked to look at the faces when they 
were presented on the computer screen.) The priming face was 
immediately followed by a word or pseudoword (target stimu-
lus), which stayed on the screen until the participant responded. 
Each face was presented four times, once with a trait that was 
implied by the behaviors previously paired with the face (20 
trials), once with a trait that was unrelated to these behaviors 
(20 trials), and twice with a pseudoword (40 trials). The order 
of the 80 trials was randomized for each participant. Partici-
pants pressed one of two designated computer keys to report 
whether or not each target stimulus was an English word.
Results
Preliminary analysis showed no effect of either gender or 
stimulus set; so these factors were dropped. Accuracy (i.e.,

percentage correct) was log-transformed and submitted to a 2 
(culture) × 2 (presentation time: 6 s vs. 9 s) × 2 (target: word 
vs. pseudoword) mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA). As 
shown in Table 1, accuracy was significantly higher for the 
word targets than for the pseudoword targets regardless of cul-
ture, F(1, 125) = 18.74, p < .001, ηp
2 = .130. We next focused 
on the trials with word targets. A 2 (culture) × 2 (presentation 
time) × 2 (trait type: implied vs. unrelated) ANOVA showed, 
as predicted, a significant Culture × Trait Type interaction, 
F(1, 125) = 9.96, p < .05, ηp
2 =.074. As shown in Figure 1a, 
European Americans’ accuracy was higher for the implied 
traits than for the unrelated traits (.98 vs. .95), t(64) = 3.25, 
p < .01, a result suggesting that the implied traits had been 
inferred and ascribed to the priming faces during the 
memorization phase of the study. Because there was no explicit 
instruction to draw such an inference, it was spontaneous. In 
contrast, the corresponding difference was negligible for Asian 
Americans (.99 vs. .99), t(63) = 1.48, p = .14. This result is 
consistent with the hypothesis that Asian Americans do not 
engage in spontaneous trait inference, although, in this case, a 
ceiling effect could have been involved. The cultural differ-
ence was moderate in size, d = 0.47.
Next, we analyzed response times (RTs) for correct responses 
after excluding outliers (values 3 SDs or more from the mean 
for each participant). Overall, as shown in Table 1, lexical deci-
sion was faster for the word targets than for the pseudoword 
targets, F(1, 125) = 15.92, p < .001, ηp
2 =.119. The overall RT 
did not vary across cultures, F < 1. For the trials with word

targets, a 2 (culture) × 2 (presentation time) × 2 (trait type: 
implied vs. unrelated) ANOVA showed a significant inter- 
action between culture and trait type, F(1, 125) = 13.84, p < .001, 
ηp
2 = .10. As illustrated in Figure 1b, for European Americans, 
lexical decision was significantly faster for the implied traits 
than for the unrelated traits (Ms = 638 vs. 665 ms), t(64) = 4.94, 
p < .001. Among Asian Americans, however, the difference 
completely disappeared (Ms = 639 vs. 636 ms), t < 1. The 
cultural difference was moderate in size, d = 0.65.
In Study 1, we used a procedure designed to assess the 
cumulative effect of both trait activation and trait binding 
without requesting any trait judgment. We found the first solid 
evidence for the predicted cultural difference in spontaneous 
trait inference. Results for both accuracy and RT indicated that 
European Americans made spontaneous trait inferences. How-
ever, there was no such evidence whatsoever in either measure 
for Asian Americans.
The evidence would be more convincing if we could show 
that Asian Americans can engage in trait inference when they 
intend to do so. We thus tested another group of 33 Asian Amer-
icans, who were explicitly instructed to form a clear trait impres-
sion of each stimulus person during the first phase of the study 
(except for this change, the procedure was identical to that of the 
9-s condition). Under this condition of intentional trait infer-
ence, Asian Americans showed clear evidence of trait inference: 
Accuracy was higher (Ms = .99 vs. .95), t(32) = 3.88, p < .001, 
and RT was shorter (Ms = 653 vs. 685 ms), t(32) = 3.85, p < .01, 
for the implied traits than for the unrelated traits. Thus, the cul-
tural difference observed in the main study can be attributed to 
the relative spontaneity of trait inference.
Study 2
When a trait is inferred spontaneously, the association between 
the trait and the actor is stored in a certain neural circuitry of the 
brain. This implies that a cultural difference similar to the one 
demonstrated in Study 1 should be observed with a neural indi-
cator. In Study 2, we measured stimulus-locked electrical activ-
ity of the brain (event-related potential, or ERP). Specifically, 
we were interested in an ERP component called the N400, a 
negative deflection peaking approximately 400 ms after stimu-
lus presentation. Typically observed in posterior electrodes, the 
N400 is thought to index detection of semantic incongruity 
(Kutas & Hillyard, 1980). Our analysis of Study 1 implies that 
during the memorization phase of the study, European Ameri-
cans spontaneously inferred a trait corresponding to each behav-
ior and associated the trait to the stimulus face paired with the 
behavior. When the face was presented as a fixation stimulus in 
the lexical decision task, the face automatically activated the 
inferred trait. Thus, if the activation of the inferred trait was fol-
lowed by presentation of its antonym, a strong N400 component 
may be expected. In contrast, Asian Americans in Study 1 did 
not appear to infer any traits spontaneously during the memori-
zation phase of the study. Our confidence in this conclusion 
would be greater if Asian Americans exhibited no N400 compo-
nent in response to the antonyms of the implied traits.
Participants and procedure
Twenty-three European American undergraduates (12 females 
and 11 males) and 23 Asian American undergraduates (12 
females and 11 males) at the University of Michigan partici-
pated in Study 2. First, they were presented with 60 face-
behavior pairs (two behaviors for each of 30 faces) and asked 
to memorize them. On each trial, a face was presented first (as 
in Study 1, the ethnicity of the faces was matched to the eth-
nicity of the participant). After 2 s, the paired behavior was 
added to the display on the screen. Both the face and the 
behavior remained on the screen for 7 s. This memorization 
phase was followed by a lexical decision task similar to the 
one used in Study 1. As illustrated in Figure 2a, each trial of 
this task consisted of a face prime presented for 1,500 ms as a 
fixation stimulus, immediately followed by presentation of a 
target stimulus for 200 ms. Participants were given up to 5,000 
ms to make a lexical decision on the target. The next trial 
started 1,400 ms after the response was made. In Study 2, our 
focus was on the brain response that signifies the detection of 
semantic incongruity. We therefore used traits implied by the 
stimulus behaviors and the antonyms of these traits as word 
targets in the lexical decision task (30 trials each). An equal 
number of pseudoword targets (60 trials) was also included, 
for a total of 120 trials, which were divided into two blocks 
(30 word-target and 30 pseudoword-target trials in each). The 
blocks were repeated twice, for a total of four blocks and 240 
trials. The order of trials within each block was randomized 
for each participant. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was 
recorded during the task. After the computer task, participants 
filled out Singelis’s (1994) scale of self-construal.
EEG was recorded from 32 Ag/AgCl electrodes embedded 
in an elastic cap according to the 10-20 system. Electrooculo-
gram (EOG) was also recorded, with electrodes placed above 
and below both eyes, as well as at a position lateral to the left 
outer canthus. EOG was used to monitor horizontal and verti-
cal eye movements. In addition, two electrodes were placed on 
the left and right mastoid (M1 and M2, respectively). EEG and 
EOG were recorded with a bandwidth of DC to 104 Hz (3 dB/
octave) using a Biosemi Active Two system (Biosemi, Inc., 
Amsterdam, The Netherlands) with a sampling rate of 512 Hz.
For off-line analysis, EEG was rereferenced to average 
activity of the left and right mastoids and resampled at 256 Hz. 
The EEG for each trial was corrected for vertical and horizon-
tal EOG artifacts, as recommended by Gratton, Coles, and 
Donchin (1983). ERPs to word targets were averaged over an 
epoch of 1,200 ms (starting 200 ms prior to the presentation of 
each target), using a 200-ms prestimulus baseline. Only trials 
with correct responses were averaged. Trials with deflections 
exceeding ±100 µV were excluded from averaging.
Results
Behavioral data. Mean accuracies and RTs are presented in 
Table 2. ANOVAs performed on these means showed no sig-
nificant effects of our experimental variables. When trait

information is activated by a face prime, this activation may 
spread to the trait’s antonym as well (see Todorov & Uleman, 
2002, for evidence). This could facilitate lexical decision for 
both the implied trait and its antonym even though participants 
would still be able to recognize the meaning of the antonym as 
incongruous with the trait.
ERP analysis. The time course of ERPs was examined at all 
scalp locations first. The clearest pattern was identified in the 
posterior central (Pz) scalp location. This result is consistent 
with previous work showing that the visual N400 is most 
clearly observed in the centro-posterior region of the brain 
(Kutas & Federmeier, 2000).
As shown in Figure 2b, for European Americans, a clear N400 
component was identified when the targets were antonyms of 
the implied traits. The N400 component would be expected only 
if the faces activated traits implied by the behaviors associated 
with the faces. Hence, this ERP pattern clearly indicates that 
European Americans spontaneously inferred a trait of a stimulus 
person from his or her behaviors during the memorization phase

of the study. For Asian Americans, however, there was no such 
incongruity effect. This finding lends further support to the 
hypothesis that Asian Americans do not engage in spontaneous 
trait inference.
To look more closely at the cross-cultural difference in the 
N400 at Pz, we computed both the mean amplitude and the 
peak amplitude for each of two relevant time periods (350–
450 ms and 450–550 ms) for each participant and submitted 
these values to 2 (culture) × 2 (trait type) ANOVAs. The results 
were largely identical for the two indices, so we focus here on 
the mean amplitude. As predicted, we found a significant 
interaction between culture and trait type during both the  
earlier (350–450 ms) and the later (450–550 ms) periods, 
F(1, 44) = 6.51, p < .05, ηp
2 = .129, and F(1, 44) = 9.67, p < .01, 
ηp
2 = .180, respectively. European Americans showed a sig-
nificantly greater negativity for the incongruous traits (i.e., 
antonyms) than for the implied traits in the 350- to 450-ms 
period, t(22) = 3.06, p < .01, and in the 450- to 550-ms period, 
t(22) = 2.89, p < .01. For Asian Americans, however, there was 
no such difference, t(22) = 0.21, n.s., and t(22) = 1.29, n.s., 
respectively. The cultural difference in the incongruity effect 
was quite sizable, d = 0.77 for the 350- to 450-ms period and 
d = 0.93 for the 450- to 550-ms period.
Self-construal. We argued that the cultural difference in spon-
taneous trait inference is due to a corresponding difference in 
independent versus interdependent self-construal (Duff & 
Newman, 1997). To test this proposition, we examined whether 
the cultural difference in the N400 incongruity effect was 
mediated by this construct.
In both cultural groups, the ERP incongruity effect (the mag-
nitude of negativity during the implied-trait trials minus the 
magnitude of negativity during the incongruous-trait trials) sig-
nificantly increased with increasing independent self-construal; 
further, the relationship was reversed for interdependent self-
construal. We therefore subtracted each participant’s interde-
pendence score from his or her independence score to obtain a 
summary index of independent self-construal. European Ameri-
cans were more independent than Asian Americans, as predicted 
(M = 0.70, SD = 1.09, vs. M = −0.10, SD = 1.09), t(44) = 2.25,p < 
.05, d = 0.68, or β = 0.33, p < .05. Also as predicted, the ERP 
incongruity effect was positively associated with independent 
self-construal during both the 350- to 450-ms period, β = 0.32, 
p < .05, and the 450- to 550-ms period, β = 0.35, p < .05. The 
relevant scatter plots are shown in Figures 2c and 2d. Control-
ling for independent self-construal resulted in a decrease in the 
cultural difference in the ERP incongruity effect, from β = 0.36, 
p < .05, to β = 0.25, n.s., in the 350- to 450-ms period and from 
β = 0.42, p < .01, to β = 0.30, p < .05, in the 450- to 550-ms 
period. In a bootstrap mediation model following the procedure 
recommended by Shrout and Bolger (2002), the 95% confi-
dence intervals for the path from culture to the incongruity 
effect did not include zero when the mediator was included in 
the model (see Fig. 3). This result shows that the cultural differ-
ence in spontaneous trait inference was partially mediated by 
independent self-construal.
Discussion
We have provided the first unequivocal evidence that sponta-
neous trait inference is quite robust among European Ameri-
cans, but not among Asian Americans. We went beyond 
previous work by using a diagnostic task that assesses the 
cumulative effect of both trait activation and trait binding. 
Furthermore, our task required no trait judgment, so that trait 
inference during the diagnostic task cannot explain the results. 
The cultural difference was partially mediated by individual 
differences in independent (vs. interdependent) self-construal. 
One possible limitation of these studies stems from the fact 
that we tested the degree of spontaneous trait inference when 
Asian and European Americans processed information about 
members of their respective in-groups. More work is required

Cultural Specificity of Spontaneous Trait Inference

to test whether our conclusions would hold for the perception 
of out-group members. Furthermore, different ethnic groups 
are associated with different stereotypes, which might in turn 
have effects on spontaneous trait inference.
Our lexical decision procedure is notable because it lends 
itself to a robust ERP measure of spontaneous trait inference. 
Curiously, in another recent ERP study on spontaneous trait 
inference, Van Duynslaeger et al. (2008) looked at a different 
ERP component (see also Van Overwalle, Van den Eede, 
Baetens, & Vandekerckhove, 2009). In that study, Dutch par-
ticipants merely read a trait-implying description of a target 
person (e.g., “friendly”). Next, they were asked to read a series 
of sentences describing various behaviors of that person; these 
behaviors were either congruous or incongruous with the trait 
implied by the initial description (e.g., “Tolvan gave her a 
hug” vs. “Tolvan gave her a fist”). Results were consistent 
with the fact that Western Europeans, including the Dutch, 
have relatively independent self-construals (Kitayama, Park, 
Servincer, Karasawa, & Uskul, 2009). ERPs differed between 
behaviors that were congruous with expectations and behav-
iors that were incongruous with expectations. Curiously, how-
ever, this difference was observed not in the N400, but in a late 
positive potential (positive-going deflection beginning around 
400–500 ms poststimulus).
In our study, semantic incongruity was clearly manipu-
lated by pairing a stimulus face with an incongruous trait. 
Because of this, we predicted that the N400 would be a sensi-
tive index of spontaneous trait inference, and we found that  
it was. But in the study by Van Duynslaeger et al. (2008), 
even when a behavior was seemingly incongruous with an 
expectation (e.g., “giving a fist” is typically not friendly), the 
behavior might still have been interpretable as fitting into the 
expectation (perhaps the person was joking). This may 
explain why, in their study, the late positivity indicated greater 
context updating (updating one’s representation) (Donchin & 
Coles, 1988), for incongruous behaviors than for congruous 
behaviors.
In the literature, the cultural variation in social explanation 
is typically explained in terms of deliberate attention applied 
to information about social constraints (Choi et al., 1999;  
Gilbert & Malone, 1995). Central to this approach is the prem-
ise that initial trait inference is automatic in all cultures. Along 
with an earlier finding that the cultural difference in corre-
spondence bias (the tendency to infer a trait that corresponds 
to an observed behavior) persists even when attentive process-
ing of the behavior is minimized (Miyamoto & Kitayama, 
2002), the current findings call this premise into question.
Another important contribution of the present work con-
cerns its use of the N400 ERP component to investigate a cul-
tural difference in information processing. As in other recent 
studies (e.g., Goto, Ando, Huang, Yee, & Lewis, 2010; Ishii, 
Kobayashi, & Kitayama, 2010), the N400 component was 
quite sensitive to cultural influences. These data suggest that 
culture’s effects are quite pervasive, being evident even quite 
early, during highly automatic stages of processing. Our work, 
then, joins the emerging literature on cultural neuroscience 
(Chiao & Ambady, 2007; Kitayama & Park, 2010) in high-
lighting the promise of using brain measures to uncover the 
nature of cultural influences.
