GenBank Accession Number Reference Sheet 
The International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) consists of the DNA Data Bank 
of Japan (DDBJ), the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and GenBank at NCBI. As part 
of this Collaboration, all three organizations accept new sequence submissions and share sequence data 
among the three databases. To facilitate the exchange of data, each member of the collaboration is 
assigned certain accession prefixes. 
 
Format for GenBank accession numbers: 
Type 
Format 
Nucleotide 
1 letter + 5 numerals or 2 letters + 6 numerals or 2 letters + 8 numerals 
Protein 
3 letters + 5 numerals or 3 letters + 7 numerals 
WGS 
4 letters + 2 numerals for WGS assembly version + 6 or more numerals or 
6 letters + 2 numerals for WGS assembly version + 7 or more numerals 
MGA 
5 letters + 7 numerals

Version number suffix: 
A GenBank sequence version number consists of an accession number of the record followed by a dot 
and a version number (i.e., Accession.Version). The version number will increment by one when there is 
an update to the sequence record. 
 
Format for RefSeq accession numbers: 
RefSeq accession numbers do not follow the naming conventions set by INSDC — they have a two-letter 
prefix followed by an underscore. RefSeq records are classified as “Known RefSeq” (manually reviewed 
by NCBI staff or collaborators) or “Model RefSeq” (records produced by an automated pipeline).
