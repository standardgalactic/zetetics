Praise for the first edition:
‘Practical Phonetics and Phonology gathers together a far wider range of topics than
other books on English phonetics. Many more accents of English are discussed, and
we really learn about English as a world language. Experienced teachers of English
and beginning students will all profit from this book.’
Peter Ladefoged, University of California, Los Angeles, USA
Praise for the third edition:
‘This is a book that I have used in teaching with great success. I am delighted to wel-
come this new and extended edition.’ 
John Wells, University College London, UK
‘Practical Phonetics and Phonology keeps getting better! Our undergraduate students
already valued its accessibility, clarity of description and detailed coverage of English
accents. The addition of further descriptions of languages other than English and 
in-depth discussion of issues in pronunciation teaching make the book highly recom-
mended reading for our postgraduate students in linguistics and English language 
teaching, too.’
Leendert Plug, University of Leeds, UK
‘Students often ask me for reference books about phonetics and phonology, and Practical
Phonetics and Phonology is the first that I recommend. It is an excellent combination
of theory and practice, with abundant resources and practice material both written
and spoken, covering a large number of English accents and including outlines of some
major languages. Presented in direct and easy-to-follow language, with first-rate 
diagrams and illustrations, it allows readers to study the subject as if they were attending
a series of interesting lectures. This new edition is going to be a “must” for all students
of phonetics and phonology.’
Masaki Taniguchi, Kochi University, Japan
‘I liked the second edition and I like the third even more. The book is carefully planned,
diligently structured and clearly written. The contents are up to date; they are geared
to the needs of newcomers to phonetics and phonology. There is a strong emphasis
on the practical side: the reader’s understanding is tested repeatedly throughout 
the book with more than 120 activities. Many sound samples are provided for close
listening and analysis. A highly recommendable book!’
Petr Rösel, University of Mainz, Germany

HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
The Routledge English Language Introductions offer key information and a set of
resources that you can use to suit your own style of study. The books are divided 
into four sections:
A
Introduction – sets out the key concepts for the area of study.
B
Development – adds to your knowledge and builds on the key ideas already 
introduced.
C
Exploration – provides examples of language data and guides you through your
own investigation of the ﬁeld.
D
Extension – offers you the chance to compare your expertise with key readings
in the area. These are taken from the work of important writers, and are provided
with guidance and questions for your further thought.
Most books in the Routledge English Language Introductions series are designed
to be read either straight through (like a traditional textbook), or across the numbered
units to allow you to follow a thread in depth quickly. For Practical Phonetics and
Phonology we have retained the four-section structure. However, the nature of phonetics
requires a cumulative build-up of knowledge; so you ﬁrst need to read all the units
in Sections A and B fully and in sequence before going on to the accent samples in
Section C, and the extension readings in Section D.
The glossary/index at the end, together with the suggestions for further reading,
will help to keep you orientated. Each textbook has a supporting website with extra
commentary, suggestions, additional material and support for teachers and students.
PRACTICAL PHONETICS AND PHONOLOGY
One word in the title above is all-important: note that this book concentrates on 
practical rather than theoretical aspects of phonetics and phonology. It has been our
aim to present the subject in the kind of down-to-earth way that readers will ﬁnd 
easy to follow, enabling them to absorb the most signiﬁcant basic principles and 
terminology. Exercise activities are provided at regular intervals to reinforce and 
extend what has been learnt.
We emphasise throughout how phonetics and phonology can supply insights to
help you understand those aspects of speech and pronunciation that most people seem
to ﬁnd interesting. These include such matters as the ways in which regional accents
differ from each other, how over the centuries English pronunciation has changed (and
is still changing), and how phonetic knowledge can help you to pronounce foreign
languages more effectively. Incidentally, we must state at the outset that this is not a

viii
H O W  T O  U S E  T H I S  B O O K
book on elocution or speech training. We believe that the way you speak your native
language is your own concern, and it isn’t any of our business to tell native English
speakers that certain types of accent are better or worse than others. (For non-natives
we do provide some hints and guidance on making your English pronunciation more
convincing.)
The practical emphasis also explains why we include a free audio CD with this
book. Not only does this provide you with spoken examples as you read along, but it
also enables you to listen to nearly ﬁfty minutes of samples of English drawn from all
over the world. A ﬁnal practical resource is the website with extra information, ques-
tions, keys to exercise activities and links to many other Internet pages. By accessing
this material, you can go on to expand your knowledge by investigating areas of speech
science beyond what we can deal with in an introductory textbook.
Section A introduces some basic concepts and leads you on to absorb the ideas and
terminology needed for the all-round study of human speech (i.e. general phonetics).
It introduces the phoneme and teaches you how to use phonemic transcription to 
write down the sounds of English with greater accuracy than ordinary spelling would
ever allow.
Building on this foundation, Section B develops your expertise through a closer study
of the phonetics of English – including not just the vowels and consonants, but also
many of the interesting features of connected speech such as stress and intonation.
Section C explores English in a selection of its many varieties. The audio CD includes
English spoken by twenty-ﬁve genuine speakers of different English accents world-
wide – ranging from Dublin to Delhi, and from Scotland to Singapore. For each accent 
there is a full transcript plus a brief description of the salient phonetic features. You’ll
also ﬁnd out how English has developed over the centuries and how its pronunci-
ation is changing even now in our own time. This section is rounded off with guidelines
showing you how practical phonetics can be used both as an aid for English-speakers
learning foreign languages, and also as an effective way of teaching English pronunci-
ation to non-natives.
Section D extends your knowledge further by means of a selection of writings about
phonetics by well-known experts in the ﬁeld. These take in a wide range – including
attitudes to regional accents, computer speech synthesis and speech recognition,
teaching and learning the pronunciation of a foreign language, and the ways in which
forensic phonetics can be used to ﬁght crime. Our hope is that through reading these
authors you’ll be inspired to go on to discover much more about that most complex
and fascinating of human activities – speech.

PREFACES AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Preface to the first edition
In the course of writing this book we have been helped in many different ways by 
colleagues, students, friends and family. Our thanks go out to them all, but especially
to those mentioned below.
Ron Carter gave us much wise advice at the planning stage, and the series editor
Peter Stockwell has provided us with valuable guidance from then on. Crucial help and
support has come all along the way from the editorial staff at Routledge, successively
from Louisa Semlyen, Christy Kirkpatrick, Kate Parker and Ruth Jeavons; a special
note of gratitude for her efﬁciency, patience and cheerfulness under pressure goes to
Margaret Aherne.
We want to thank all those colleagues who offered perceptive critical comments on
preliminary drafts and the ﬁnal manuscript. Most (though not all) of their sugges-
tions have been acted upon, and we have ended up with a greatly improved book as
a consequence. In this regard, we must make special mention of Philip Carr, Rias van
den Doel, Jack Windsor Lewis, Robert Phillipson and Gilda Suárez de Nielsen. We
also gained much from the detailed criticism contained in Paul Tench’s review of the
penultimate version of the manuscript. Colin Ewen not only read and commented on
the book in draft form, but also aided us in a very practical way by constructing and
digitising all the vowel diagrams and intonation representations. Help with providing
and checking language materials was given by Sarah Branci, Rolf Bremmer, Inès Brulard,
Robert Druce, Gyde Hansen, Arnt Lykke Jakobsen, María Pilar Lorenzo, Vincent Phillips,
Klaske van Leyden and Carol Williams. Useful feedback on many matters came from
students at the Copenhagen Business School who allowed us to expose them to earlier
versions of the text. We are also grateful to Jennifer Jenkins, who used portions of the
material with her students at King’s College London. Finally, mention must be made
of Arnold Warthog, who was constantly on hand to assist us in every aspect of our work.
For the audio CD, we beneﬁted greatly from the technical expertise of Steve 
Hitchins, who assembled and edited the ﬁnal version of the disk. In this connection,
we also want to thank Vincent van Heuven for the use of recording facilities at Leiden
University, and John Wells for permission to use a portion of the recording of the
cardinal vowels made for University College London by the late A. C. Gimson. For the
provision of recorded materials used in the collection of English accent varieties we are
much indebted to Alastair Hamilton, Mia Overlade Hansen, Jen Hay, Gerry Knowles,
Lesley Milroy, Debi Molnar, Tine Ditlev Nielsen, Kitt Spangbjerg Petersen, Yvonne
Spuijbroek, Karen Stetting and Maria Vanlaeken-Kester. Finally, our thanks go out
to all the anonymous recorded speakers for their time, trouble and goodwill.
Naturally, we do not wish to saddle any of those mentioned above with blame
for whatever defects and errors remain in the book. That responsibility is ours alone.

Preface to the second edition
In this new edition, numerous changes, corrections and additions have been made
throughout the text, including the introduction of several new maps and diagrams.
The audio CD now contains examples of two more English pronunciation varieties –
namely British Estuary English and New York English – both of which also feature in
the revised text. In Section B, a complete new unit, intended for the non-native learner
of English, has been introduced, covering English orthography and spelling-to-sound
pronunciation guides. In Section D, there are two extra readings from leading ﬁgures
in the ﬁelds of phonetics and sociolinguistics. John Wells discusses the problems 
associated with spelling reform, while Peter Trudgill covers current changes in the social
perception of various British English regional and social varieties, ranging from traditional
Received Pronunciation through to Estuary English and a selection of regional accents.
In producing this new version of our book, we have had help from many 
sources. First, at Taylor and Francis, we want to thank Peter Stockwell (series 
editor) for his advice and guidance, and Nadia Seemungal for her willingness to deal
promptly with any problem thrown at her. We have had useful criticism and sugges-
tions from a number of reviewers, who provided incisive assessment and criticism. 
In particular, we must mention Madalena Cruz-Ferreira, who not only reviewed the
book in a most perceptive manner, but then, in response to our request, sent extra
comments to us personally. Five anonymous peer reviewers also provided invaluable
advice and suggestions. We are grateful to them all.
Help has also come in various ways from many friends and colleagues. We are
especially grateful to Rias van den Doel for all the assistance he gave at the proofreading
stage. In addition, we wish to express our gratitude to Inès Brulard, Philip Carr, 
Simon Cook, Anne Fabricius, Anne Margrethe Hauge, Christian Jensen, Klaske van
Leyden, Catherine Meinertz-Nielsen, Lowell Melka-Teichroew, Talía Morris, Brian 
Mott, Jan Posthumus, Bert Schouten and Jack Windsor Lewis. In addition, we have
had valuable feedback from many users of the book, and in particular our students
at the Copenhagen Business School, Ghent University and the Université Catholique
de Lille.
We need hardly say, as before, that any blame for remaining errors or omissions
in the text should be laid solely at our door.

Preface to the third edition
Although this third edition has several additional features, many corrections and much
revision, nevertheless the overall structure of the book remains the same. We saw no
reason to make radical changes to what appears on the whole to have been a successful
formula.

We wish once more to express our gratitude to all those, acknowledged above,
who have assisted us in the past, and to the reviewers, students and colleagues who
have helped us with this edition. Special thanks go to Philip Carr, Andrew Kehoe, Petr
Rösel and Jack Windsor Lewis. We also want to put on record our debt to Paul Carley,
Marta Dura, Alex Rotatori and Masaki Taniguchi for their contributions to the new
language descriptions in Section C. In addition, we have benefited from feedback from
our students – especially from participants in the University College London Summer
Course in English Phonetics (SCEP) in recent years. At Routledge, we have had much
help and support, and we now want to thank Isabelle Cheng, Rachel Daw, Sarah May
and, especially, for overseeing the whole operation, Nadia Seemungal.

I N T R O D U C T I O N
ENGLISH WORLDWIDE
Introduction
If you’ve picked up this book and are reading it, we can assume one or two things about
you. First, you’re a human being – not a dolphin, not a parrot, not a chimpanzee. No
matter how intelligent such creatures may appear to be at communicating in their
different ways, they simply do not have the innate capacity for language that makes
humans unique in the animal world.
Then, we can assume that you speak English. You are either a native speaker,
which means that you speak English as your mother tongue; or you’re a non-native
speaker using English as your second language; or a learner of English as a foreign
language. Whichever applies to you, we can also assume, since you are reading this,
that you are literate and are aware of the conventions of the written language – like
spelling and punctuation. So far, so good. Now, what can a book on English phonetics
and phonology do for you?
In fact, the study of both phonetics (the science of speech sound) and phonology
(how sounds pattern and function in a given language) are going to help you to learn
more about language in general and English in particular. If you’re an English native
speaker, you’ll be likely to discover much about your mother tongue of which you were
previously unaware. If you’re a non-native learner, it will also assist in improving your
pronunciation and listening abilities. In either case, you will end up better able to teach
English pronunciation to others and possibly ﬁnd it easier to learn how to speak other
languages better yourself. You’ll also discover some things about the pronunciation
of English in the past, and about the great diversity of accents and dialects that go to
make up the English that’s spoken at present. Let’s take this last aspect as a starting
point as we survey brieﬂy some of the many types of English pronunciation that we
can hear around us in the modern world.
Accent and dialect in English
You may well already have some idea of what the terms ‘accent’ and ‘dialect’ mean, but
we shall now try to deﬁne these concepts more precisely. All languages typically exist
in a number of different forms. For example, there may be several ways in which the
language can be pronounced; these are termed accents. To cover variation in grammar
and vocabulary we use the term dialect. If you want to take in all these aspects of 
language variation – pronunciation together with grammar and vocabulary – then 
you can simply use the term variety.
We can make two further distinctions in language variation, namely between 
regional variation, which involves differences between one place and another; and
social variation, which reﬂects differences between one social group and another 
(this can cover such matters as gender, ethnicity, religion, age and, very signiﬁcantly,
social class). Regional variation is accepted by everyone without question. It is 
common knowledge that people from London do not speak English in the same 
way as those from Bristol, Edinburgh or Cardiff; nor, on a global scale, in the same
way as the citizens of New York, Sydney, Johannesburg or Auckland. What is more
controversial is the question of social variation in language, especially where the link
with social class is concerned. Some people may take offence when it is pointed out
A1

E N G L I S H  W O R L D W I D E

that accent and dialect are closely connected with class differences, but it would be
very difﬁcult to deny this fact.
In considering variation we can take account of a range of possibilities. The broad-
est local accents are termed basilects (adjective: basilectal). These are associated with
working-class occupations and persons less privileged in terms of education and other
social factors. The most prestigious forms of speech are termed acrolects (adjective:
acrolectal). These, by contrast, are generally found in persons with more advantages
in terms of wealth, education and other social factors. In addition, we ﬁnd a range of
mesolects (adjective: mesolectal) – a term used to cover varieties intermediate between
the two extremes, the whole forming an accent continuum. This situation has often
been represented in the form of a triangle, sometimes referred to as the sociolinguistic
pyramid (Figure A1.1). In England, for example, there is great variation regionally
amongst the basilectal varieties. On the other hand, the prestigious acrolectal accent
exhibits very few differences from one area to another. Mesolects once again fall in
between, with more variation than in the acrolect but less than in the basilects. Note
that the concept of the sociolinguistic pyramid (or ‘triangle’) is discussed in more detail
by Peter Trudgill in Section D (pp. 286–93).
In the British Isles it is fair to say that one variety of English pronunciation has
traditionally been connected with the more privileged section of the population. As
a result, it became what is termed a prestige accent, namely, a variety regarded highly
even by those who do not speak it, and associated with status, education and wealth.
This type of English is variously referred to as ‘Oxford English’, ‘BBC English’ and
even ‘the Queen’s English’, but none of these names can be considered at all accurate.
For a long time, phoneticians have called it RP – short for Received Pronunciation;
in the Victorian era, one meaning of ‘received’ was ‘socially acceptable’. Recently the
term ‘Received Pronunciation’ (in the full form rather than the abbreviation favoured
by phoneticians) seems to have caught on with the media, and has begun to have wider
currency with the general public.

I N T R O D U C T I O N
Traditional RP could be regarded as the classic example of a prestige accent, 
since although it was spoken only by a small percentage of the population it had high 
status everywhere in Britain and, to an extent, the world. RP was not a regional but
a social accent; it was to be heard all over England (though only from a minority of
speakers). Although to some extent associated with the London area, this probably
only reﬂected the greater wealth of the south-east of England as compared with the
rest of the country. RP continues to be much used in the theatre and at one time was
virtually the only speech employed by national BBC radio and television announcers
– hence the term ‘BBC English’. Nowadays, the BBC has a declared policy of employ-
ing a number of announcers with (modiﬁed) regional accents on its national TV and
radio networks. On the BBC World Service and BBC World TV there are in addition
announcers and presenters who use other global varieties. Traditional RP also happens
to be the kind of pronunciation still heard from older members of the British Royal
Family; hence the term ‘the Queen’s English’.
Within RP itself, it was possible to distinguish a number of different types 
(see Wells 1982: 279–95 for a detailed discussion). The original narrow deﬁnition 
included mainly persons who had been educated at one of what in Britain are called 
‘public schools’ (actually very expensive boarding schools) like Eton, Harrow and
Winchester. It was always true, however, that – for whatever reason – many English
people from less exclusive social backgrounds either lost, or considerably modiﬁed,
their distinctive regional speech and ended up speaking RP or something very similar
to it. In this book, because of the dated – and to some people objectionable – social
connotations, we shall not normally use the label RP (except consciously to refer 
to the upper-class speech of the twentieth century). Rather than dealing with what 
is now regarded by many of the younger generation as a quaint minority accent, 
we shall instead endeavour to describe a more encompassing neutral type of modern
British English but one which nevertheless lacks obvious local accent features. To refer
to this variety we shall employ the term non-regional pronunciation (abbreviated to 
NRP). We shall thus be able to allow for the present-day range of variation to be 
heard from educated middle and younger generation speakers in England who have
a pronunciation which cannot be pinned down to a speciﬁc area. Note, however, that
phoneticians these days commonly use the term ‘Standard Southern British English’,
or SSBE for short.
Traditional Received Pronunciation (RP)  Track 1
Jeremy: yes what put me off Eton was the importance attached to games because
I wasn’t sporty – I was very bad at games – I was of a rather sort of cowardly dis-
position – and the idea to have to run around in the mud and get kicked in the face
– by a lot of larger boys three times a week – I found terribly terribly depressing –
fortunately this only really happened one time a year – at the most two – because
in the summer one could go rowing – and then one was just alone with one’s 
enormous blisters – in the stream –
Interviewer: which games did you play though – or did you have to play –
Jeremy: well you had to play – I mean I liked – I was – the only thing I was any good
at was fencing and I liked rather solitary things like fencing or squash or things 
like that – but you had to play – Eton had its own ghastly combination of rugger and

soccer which was called the ‘ﬁeld game’ – and that was for the so-called Oppidans
[fee-paying pupils who form the overwhelming majority at Eton] like myself – and
then there was the Wall Game – which was even worse – and that was for the 
college – in other words the non-paying students known as ‘tugs’ –
Interviewer: known as –
Jeremy: tugs – 
Interviewer: ah right –
Jeremy: they were called tugs – 
Interviewer: there was a lot of slang I suppose
Jeremy: there was a lot of slang – I wonder how much it’s still understood – and I
don’t know if it still exists at Eton – whether it’s changed
Jeremy, a university professor, was born in the early 1940s. His speech is a very con-
servative variety, by which we mean that he retains many old-fashioned forms in his
pronunciation. Jeremy, in fact, preserves many of the features of traditional Received
Pronunciation (as described in numerous books on phonetics written in the twentieth
century) which have since been abandoned by most younger speakers.
Modern non-regional pronunciation (NRP)  Track 2
Daniel: last time I went to France I got bitten – thirty-seven times by mosquitoes – 
it was really cool – I had them all up my leg – and I got one on the sole of my foot
– that was the worst place ever – it’s really actually quite interesting – it’s really 
big – and we didn’t have like any – any mosquito bite stuff – so I just itched all week
Interviewer: what are you going to do this summer – except for going to France
Daniel: go to France – and then come back here for about – ten days – I’m supposed to
get a job to pay my Dad back all the money that I owe him – except no one wants
to give me a job – so – I’m going to have to be a prostitute or something – I don’t
know – well – I’m here for ten days after I come back from France anyway – and
then we go to Orlando on the 1st of August – for two weeks – come back and then
I get my results – and if they’re good then – I’m happy – and if they’re not good –
then – I spend – the next six weeks working – to do resits – and then end of September
– go to university
You’ll notice straightaway that this speaker, Daniel, whose non-regionally deﬁned 
speech is not atypical of the younger generation of educated British speakers, sounds
different from Jeremy in many ways. Daniel grew up in the 1980s (the recording dates
from 1996) indicating that well before the end of the twentieth century non-regional
pronunciation (NRP) was effectively largely replacing traditional RP.
Of late, there’s been talk of a ‘new’ variety of British accent which has been dubbed
Estuary English – a term originally coined by David Rosewarne (1984) and later enthu-
siastically embraced by the media. The estuary in question is that of the Thames, and
the name has been given to the speech of those whose accents are a compromise between
traditional RP and popular London speech (or Cockney, see Section C2). Listen to
this speaker, Matthew, a university lecturer, who was born and grew up in London,
and whose speech is what many would consider typical of Estuary English. Matthew’s
accent is clearly inﬂuenced by his London upbringing, but has none of the low-
status basilectal features of Cockney as described on pp. 169–70.

I N T R O D U C T I O N
Estuary English  Track 3
Matthew: but generally speaking – I thought Shefﬁeld was a lovely place – I enjoyed
my time there immensely – some of the things that people said to you – took a 
little bit of getting used to – I did I think look askance the ﬁrst time – I got on a bus
– and I was called ‘love’ by the bus driver – but I wasn’t really used to this kind of
thing at the time – I do remember one thing – it was delightfully quiet in Shefﬁeld
because – I grew up – in west London near the ﬂight path of Heathrow – the ﬁrst
night I slept in Shefﬁeld – I couldn’t sleep – and – this was despite some kind of –
hideous sherry party which had been thrown to – loosen up the students in some
kind of way – and eventually I worked out why I couldn’t sleep – and that was because
it was so bloody quiet – I was used to the dim roar of Heathrow – and the trafﬁc
of the M4 and the A4 – vague hiss in the background – and to be confronted with
a room to sleep in – where there was no noise whatsoever – was quite frightening
really – and I think that was one of the reasons – that I developed the habit of want-
ing to go to sleep with music on – to protect me from this terrifying silence – now
I must stress that Shefﬁeld is not known for its silence generally – but the univer-
sity part of the city – is in a very green area – well away from all of Shefﬁeld’s indus-
trial past as it were – and was actually a very quiet place – unless there was somebody
running down your student corridor shrieking
Claims have been made that Estuary English will in the future become the new
prestige British accent – but perhaps it’s too early to make predictions. What does
seem certain, however, is that change is in progress, and that one can no longer delimit
a prestige accent of British English as easily as one could in the early twentieth cen-
tury. The speech of young educated speakers in the south of England indeed appears
to show a considerable degree of London inﬂuence (Fabricius 2000) and we shall take
account of these changes in our description of NRP. For an opposing viewpoint, you
can ﬁnd a discussion of the concept of Estuary English, regarding it as a ‘myth’, in
the piece by Peter Trudgill in Section D10 (pp. 290–2). So perhaps it’s indeed too
soon to tell. For further detail see Section C5, pp. 212–14.
World Englishes
A British model of English is what is most commonly taught to students learning English
as a second language in Europe, Africa, India and much of Asia. In this book, NRP is
the accent we assume non-native speakers will choose. Our main reason for selecting
NRP is that English of this kind is easily understood not only all over Britain but also
elsewhere in the world.
In Scotland, Ireland and Wales, notwithstanding the fact that there never were
very many speakers of RP in those countries, the accent was formerly held in high
regard (certainly this is less so nowadays). This was also true of more distant English-
speaking countries such as Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Today scarcely
any Australians, New Zealanders or South Africans consciously imitate traditional 
RP as was once the case, even though the speech of radio and television announcers
in these countries clearly shows close relationships with British English. In the USA,
surprisingly, there was also many years ago a tradition of using a special artiﬁcial 
type of English, based on RP, for the stage – especially for Shakespeare and other 

E N G L I S H  W O R L D W I D E
7
classic drama. Even today, the ‘British accent’ (by which Americans essentially mean
traditional RP) retains a degree of prestige in the United States; this is especially so in
the acting profession – although increasingly in the modern cinema it seems to be the
villains rather than the heroes who speak in this manner! (Think of Anthony Hopkins
and his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter.)
But in the twenty-ﬁrst century any kind of British English is in reality a minority
form. Most English is spoken outside the British Isles – notably in the USA, where it
is the ﬁrst language of more than 220 million people. It is also used in several other
countries as a ﬁrst language, e.g. Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and
the countries of the Caribbean. English is used widely as a second language for ofﬁcial
purposes, again by millions of speakers, in Southern Asia, e.g. India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,
and in many countries across Africa. In addition, there are large second-language English-
speaking populations in, for example, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. In total,
there are probably as many as 330 million native speakers of English, and it is thought
that in addition an even greater number speak English as a second language – num-
bers are difﬁcult to estimate (Crystal 2003a: 59–71). Figure A1.2 (p. 8) provides a map
showing the two family trees of British and American varieties of English. Locations
populated largely by second-language English users are indicated in italics. See
Crystal (2003a: 62–5) for a table giving estimates of ﬁrst- and second-language
English speakers in over 70 countries.
Let’s now look a little more closely at two regions of the world where English is
used as a ﬁrst language – North America (USA and Canada) and Australasia (Australia
and New Zealand). In the United States, over the course of the last century, an accent
of English developed which today goes under the name of General American (often
abbreviated to GA). This variety is an amalgam of the educated speech of the northern
USA, having otherwise no recognisably local features. It is said to be in origin the 
educated English of the Midwest of America; it certainly lacks the characteristic accent
forms of East Coast cities such as New York and Boston. Canadian English bears a
strong family resemblance to GA – although it has one or two features which set it
ﬁrmly apart. On the other hand, the accents of the southern states of America are clearly
quite different from GA in very many respects.
GA is to be heard very widely from announcers and presenters on television 
and radio networks all over the USA, and for this reason it is popularly known 
by another name, ‘Network American’. General American is also used as a model 
by millions of students learning English as a second language – notably in Latin 
America and Japan, but nowadays increasingly elsewhere. We shall return to this vari-
ety in Section C1.
Other varieties of English which are now of global signiﬁcance are those spoken
in Australia and New Zealand. Once again there is an obvious relationship between
these two varieties, although they also have clear differences from each other. New
Zealand English has distinct ‘South Island’ types of pronunciation – but there is sur-
prisingly little regional variation across the huge continent of Australia. On the other
hand, there is considerable social variation between what are traditionally termed 
‘Broad Australian’, ‘General Australian’ and ‘Cultivated Australian English’. The ﬁrst
is the kind which most vigorously exhibits distinctive Australian features and is the
everyday speech of perhaps a third of the population. The last is the term used for the

most prestigious variety (in all respects much closer to British NRP); this minority
accent is not only to be heard from television and radio presenters but is also, in Australia
itself, taught as a model to foreign learners. General Australian, used by the majority
of Australians, falls between these two extremes.
Finally, we have to remember that while there are so many different world 
varieties of English, they are essentially (at least in their standard forms) very similar.
In fact, although the differences are interesting, it’s the degree of similarity charac-
terising these widely dispersed varieties of English which is really far more striking.
English as used by educated speakers is readily understood all over the world. In fact,
it is unquestionably the most widespread form of international communication that
has ever existed.
PHONEME, ALLOPHONE AND SYLLABLE
Introduction
At this point, let’s sort out some basic terminology. The study of sound in general 
is the science of acoustics. We’ll remind you that phonetics is the term used for the
study of sound in human language. The study of the selection and patterns of sounds
in a single language is called phonology. To get a full idea of the way the sounds of
a language work, we need to study not only the phonetics of the language concerned
but also its phonological system. Both phonetics and phonology are important com-
ponents of linguistics, which is the science that deals with the general study of 
language. A specialist in linguistics is technically termed a linguist. Note that this is
different from the general use of linguist to mean someone who can speak a number
of languages. Phonetician and phonologist are the terms used for linguists who study
phonetics and phonology respectively.
We can examine speech in various ways, corresponding to the stages of the 
transmission of the speech signal from a speaker to a listener. The movements of the
tongue, lips and other speech organs are called articulations – hence this area of 
phonetics is termed articulatory phonetics. The physical nature of the speech signal
is the concern of acoustic phonetics (you can ﬁnd some more information about these
matters on the recommended websites, pp. 313–15). The study of how the ear receives
the speech signal we call auditory phonetics. The formulation of the speech message 
in the brain of the speaker and the interpretation of it in the brain of the listener 
are branches of psycholinguistics. In this book, our emphasis will be on articulatory 
phonetics, this being in many ways the most accessible branch of the subject, and the
one with most applications for the beginner.
In our view, phonetics should be a matter of practice as well as theory. We want
you to produce sounds as well as read about them. Let’s start as we mean to go on:
say the English word mime. We are going to examine the sound at the beginning and
end of the word: [m].

Say the English word mime several times. Use a mirror to look at your mouth
as you pronounce the word. Now cut out the vowel and just say a long [m].
Keep it going for ﬁve seconds or so.
There’s a tremendous amount to say just about this single sound [m]. First, it 
can be short, or we can make it go on for quite a long period of time. Second, you
can see and feel that the lips are closed.
2
Produce a long [m]. Now pinch your nostrils tightly, blocking the escape of
air. What happens? (The sound suddenly ceases, thus implying that when
you say [m], there must be an escape of air from the nose.)
3
Once again, say a long [m]. This time put your ﬁngers in your ears. Now
you’ll be able to hear a buzz inside your head: this effect is called voice. Try
alternating [m] with silence [m . . . m . . . m . . . m . . . ]. Note how the voice
is switched on and off.
Consequently, we now know that [m] is a sound which:
q
is made with the lips (bilabial)
q
is said with air escaping from the nose (nasal)
q
is said with voice (voiced).
Do the same for a different sound – [t] as in tie.
4
Say [t] looking in a mirror. Can you prolong the sound? If you put your ﬁngers
in your ears, is there any buzz? If you pinch your nostrils, does this have any
effect on the sound? (The answer is ‘no’ in each case.)

PHONEME, ALLOPHONE AND SYLLABLE
11
[t] is a sound which:
q
is made with the tongue-tip against the teeth-ridge1 (alveolar)
q
has air escaping not from the nose but from the mouth (oral)
q
is said without voice (voiceless).
A word now about the use of different kinds of brackets. The symbols between
square brackets [ ] indicate that we are concerned with a sound and are called phonetic
symbols. The letters of ordinary spelling, technically termed orthographic symbols,
can either be placed between angle brackets <m> – or, as in this book, they can be
printed in bold, thus m.
How languages pick and pattern sounds
Human beings are able to produce a huge variety of sounds with their vocal apparatus
and a surprisingly large number of these are actually found in human speech. Noises
like clicks, or lip trills – which may seem weird to speakers of European languages –
may be simply part of everyday speech in languages spoken in, for example, Africa,
the Amazon or the Arctic regions. No language uses more than a small number of the
available possibilities but even European languages may contain quite a few sounds
unfamiliar to native English speakers. To give some idea of the possible cross-linguistic
variation, let’s now compare English to some of its European neighbours.
For example, English lacks a sound similar to the ‘scrapy’ Spanish consonant j,
as in jefe ‘boss’. This sound does exist in Scottish English (spelt ch), e.g. loch, and is
used by some English speakers in loanwords and names from other languages. A sim-
ilar sound also occurs in German Dach ‘roof’, Welsh bach ‘little’ and Dutch schip ‘ship’,
but not in French or Italian. German has no sound like that represented by th in English
think. French and Italian also have a gap here but a similar sound does exist in Spanish
cinco ‘ﬁve’ and in Welsh byth ‘ever’. English has no equivalent to the French vowel in
the word nu ‘naked’. Similar vowels can be heard in German Bücher ‘books’, Dutch
museum ‘museum’ and Danish typisk ‘typical’, although not in Spanish, Italian or Welsh.
We could go on, but these examples are enough to illustrate that each language selects
a limited range of sounds from the total possibilities of human speech.
In addition we need to consider how sounds are patterned in languages. Here are
just a few examples.
q
Neither English nor French has words beginning with the sound sequence [kn],
like German Knabe ‘boy’ or Dutch knie ‘knee’. Many centuries ago English did
indeed have this sequence, which is why spellings like knee and knot still exist.
q
Both French and Spanish have initial [fw], as in French foi ‘faith’ and Spanish
fuente ‘fountain’; this initial sequence does not occur in English, Dutch or Welsh.
q
English has many words ending in [d], contrasting with others ending in [t], e.g.
bed and bet. This is not true of German where, although words like Rad ‘wheel’
and Rat ‘advice’ are spelt differently, the ﬁnal d and t are both pronounced as [t].
Dutch is similar to German in this respect, so that Dutch bot ‘bone’ and bod ‘bid’
1 Also termed ‘alveolar ridge’.

I N T R O D U C T I O N

are said exactly the same. The same holds true for Russian and Polish, whereas
French, Spanish and Welsh are like English and contrast ﬁnal [t] and [d].
Phonemes
Speech is a continuous ﬂow of sound with interruptions only when necessary to take
in air to breathe, or to organise our thoughts. The ﬁrst task when analysing speech is to
divide up this continuous ﬂow into smaller chunks that are easier to deal with. We call
this process segmentation, and the resulting smaller sound units are termed segments
(these correspond very roughly to vowels and consonants). There is a good degree of
agreement among native speakers on what constitutes a speech segment. If English
speakers are asked how many speech sounds there are in man, they will almost certainly
say ‘three’, and will state them to be [m], [æ] and [n] (see pp. 15–16 for symbols).
Segments do not operate in isolation, but combine to form words. In man, the
segments [m], [æ] and [n] have no meaning of their own and only become meaningful
if they form part of a word. In all languages, there are certain variations in sound which
are signiﬁcant because they can change the meanings of words. For example, if we
take the word man, and replace the ﬁrst sound by [p], we get a new word pan. Two
words of this kind distinguished by a single sound are called a minimal pair.
5 (Answers on website)
Make minimal pairs in English by changing the initial consonant in these
words: hate, pen, kick, sea, down, lane, feet.
Let’s take this process further. In addition to pan, we could also produce, for exam-
ple, ban, tan, ran, etc. A set of words distinguished in this way is termed a minimal set.
Instead of changing the initial consonant, we can change the vowel, e.g. mean,
moan, men, mine, moon, which provides us with another minimal set. We can also
change the ﬁnal consonant, giving yet a third minimal set: man, mat, mad. Through
such processes, we can eventually determine those speech sounds which are phono-
logically signiﬁcant in a given language. The contrastive units of sound which can be
used to change meaning are termed phonemes. We can therefore say that the word
man consists of the three phonemes /m/, /æ/ and /n/. Note that from now on, to dis-
tinguish them as such, we shall place phonemic symbols between slant brackets / /.
We can also establish a phonemic inventory for NRP English, giving us 20 vowels
and 24 consonants (see ‘Phonemes in English and Other Languages’ below).
But not every small difference that can be heard between one sound and another
is enough to change the meaning of words. There is a certain degree of variation in
each phoneme which is sometimes very easy to hear and can be quite striking. English
/t/ is a good example. It can range from a sound made by the tip of the tongue pressed
against the teeth-ridge to types of articulation involving a ‘catch in the throat’ 
(technically termed a glottal stop). Compare /t/ in tea (tongue-tip t) and /t/ in button
(usually made with a glottal stop).

Ask a number of your friends to say the word button. Try to describe what
you hear. Is there an obvious t-sound articulated by the tongue-tip against
the teeth-ridge? Or is the /t/ produced with glottal stop? Is there a little vowel
between /t/ and /n/? Or does the speaker move directly from the /t/ to /n/
without any break? And is it the same with similar words, like kitten, cotton,
and Britain? Now try the same thing with ﬁnal /l/, as in bottle, rattle, brittle.
Do you notice any difference in people’s reactions to the use of glottal stop
in these two groups of words?
Each phoneme is therefore really composed of a number of different sounds 
which are interpreted as one meaningful unit by a native speaker of the language. 
This range is termed allophonic variation, and the variants themselves are called 
allophones.
Only the allophones of a phoneme can exist in reality as concrete entities. Allophones
are real – they can be recorded, stored and reproduced, and analysed in acoustic or
articulatory terms. Phonemes are abstract units and exist only in the mind of the
speaker/listener. It is, in fact, impossible to ‘pronounce a phoneme’ (although this phras-
ing is often loosely employed); one can only produce an allophone of the phoneme in
question. As the phoneme is an abstraction, we instead refer to its being realised
(in the sense of ‘made real’) as a particular allophone.
Although each phoneme includes a range of variation, the allophones of any single
phoneme generally have considerable phonetic similarity in both acoustic and articulat-
ory terms; that is to say, the allophones of any given phoneme:
q
usually sound fairly similar to each other
q
are usually (although not invariably) articulated in a somewhat similar way.
We can now proceed to a working deﬁnition of the phoneme as: a member of a
set of abstract units which together form the sound system of a given language and through
which contrasts of meaning are produced.
Phonemes in English and other languages
A single individual’s speech is termed an idiolect. Generally speaking, it is easy for
native speakers to interpret the phoneme system of another native speaker’s idiolect,
even if they speak a different variety of the language. Problems may sometimes arise,
but they are typically few, since broadly the phoneme systems will be largely similar.
Difﬁculties occur for the non-native learner, however, because there are always import-
ant differences between the phoneme system of one language and that of another. Take
the example of an English native speaker learning French. French people are often
surprised when they discover that an English native speaker has difﬁculty in hearing
(let alone producing) the difference between words like French tu ‘you’ and tout ‘all’.
The French vowel phonemes in these words, /y/ and /u/, seem alike to an English ear,

14
I N T R O D U C T I O N
sounding similar to the allophones of the English vowel phoneme /ui/ as in two. This
effect can be represented as follows (using the symbol [ – ] to mean contrasts with):
French tu /ty/ – tout /tu/
English two /tui/
On the other hand, French learners of English also have their problems. The English
words sit and seat sound alike to French ears, the English vowel phonemes /x/ and /ii/
being heard as if they were allophones of French /i/ as in French site ‘site’:
English seat /siit/ – sit /sxt/
French site /sit/
Another similar example is the contrast /k – ui/ as in the words pull and pool as 
compared with French /u/ in poule ‘hen’:
English pull /pkl/ – pool /puil/
French poule /pul/
Of course, we need not conﬁne this to vowel sounds. Learners often have trouble
with some of the consonants of English, for instance /0/ as in mouth. German students
of English have to learn to make a contrast between mouth and mouse. German has
no /0/, and German speakers are likely to interpret /0/ as /s/ as in the ﬁnal sound of
Maus ‘mouse’ – this being what to a German seems closest to /0/.
English mouth /mak0/ – mouse /maks/
German Maus /maks/
From the moment children start learning to talk they begin to recognise and 
appreciate those sound contrasts which are important for their own language; they
learn to ignore those which are insigniﬁcant. We all interpret the sounds of language
we hear in terms of the phonemes of our mother tongue and there are many rather
surprising examples of this. For instance, the Japanese at ﬁrst hear no difference between
the contrasting phonemes /r/ and /l/ of English, e.g. royal – loyal; Greek learners cannot
distinguish /s/ and /t/ as in same and shame; Cantonese Chinese students of English
may confuse /l/ not only with /r/ but also with /n/, so ﬁnding it difﬁcult to hear the
contrast between light, right and night. So non-natives must learn to interpret the sound
system of English as heard by English native speakers and ignore the perceptions imposed
by years of speaking and listening to their own language. Any English person learn-
ing a foreign language will have to undertake the same process in reverse.
Overview of the English phonemic system  Track 4
The consonants of English
Certain of the English consonants function in pairs – being in most respects similar, but
differing in the energy used in their production. For instance, /p/ and /b/ are articu-
lated in the same way, except that /p/ is a strong voiceless articulation, termed fortis;
whereas /b/ is a weak potentially voiced articulation, termed lenis. With other English
consonants, there is no fortis/lenis opposition. Table A2.1 shows the English conson-
ant phonemes.

The vowels of English
The vowels of English fall into three groups. We’ll classify these in very basic terms
at the moment, but shall elaborate on this in Section B3, ‘Overview of the English
Vowel System’. For steady-state/diphthong distinction, see pp. 69–70.
q
Checked steady-state vowels: these are short. They are represented by a single
symbol, e.g. /x/.
q
Free steady-state vowels: other things being equal, these are long. They are rep-
resented by a symbol plus a length mark i, e.g. /ii/.
q
Free diphthongs: other things being equal, these are long. They have tongue and/or
lip movement and are represented by two symbols, e.g. /ex/.
Note that all vowels may be shortened owing to pre-fortis clipping (see p. 58). The
effect is most noticeable with free steady-state vowels and diphthongs.
In Table A2.2 we have provided keywords (adapted from Wells 1982) as a con-
venient way of referring to each of the English vowel phonemes. Keywords are shown

Phoneme, syllable and word
The syllable
The syllable is a unit difﬁcult to deﬁne, though native speakers of a language gen-
erally have a good intuitive feeling for the concept, and are usually able to state how
many syllables there are in a particular word. For instance, if native speakers of English
are asked how many syllables there are in the word potato they usually have little doubt
that there are three (even if for certain words, e.g. extract, they might ﬁnd it difﬁcult
to say just where one syllable ends and another begins).
A syllable can be deﬁned very loosely as a unit larger than the phoneme but smaller
than the word. Phonemes can be regarded as the basic phonological elements. Above
the phoneme, we can consider units larger in extent, namely the syllable and the word.
Syllabic consonants
Typically, every syllable contains a vowel at its nucleus, and may have one or more con-
sonants either side of this vowel at its margins. If we take the syllable cats as an example,
the vowel acting as the nucleus is /æ/, and the consonants at the margins /k/ and /ts/.
However, certain consonants are also able to act as the nuclear elements of syllables.
In English, /n m l/ (and occasionally /f/) can function in this way, as in bitten /Bbxt5/,
rhythm /Brxq4/, subtle /Bswt3/. Here the syllabic element is not formed by a vowel, but
by one of the consonants /m n f l/, which are in this case longer and more prominent
than normal. Such consonants are termed syllabic consonants, and are shown by a
little vertical mark [C] placed beneath the symbol concerned. In many cases, alternative
pronunciations with /e/ are also possible, e.g. /Brxqem/. In certain types of English, such
as General American, Scottish and West Country, /r/ can also be syllabic: hiker /Bhaxk6/.

Phonemic and phonetic transcription
One of the most useful applications of phonetics is to provide transcription to indic-
ate pronunciation. It is especially useful for languages like English (or French) which
have inconsistent spellings. For instance, in English, the sound /ii/ can be represented
as e (be), ea (dream), ee (seen), ie (believe), ei (receive), etc. See Section C6 for the same
phenomenon in French.
7 (Answers on website)
Find a number of different spellings for (1) the vowel sounds of face, price,
thought and nurse (in NRP /ex ax ci $i/) and (2) the consonant sounds 
/dnt s k/.
Now try doing the same thing in reverse. See if you can ﬁnd a number of
different pronunciations for (1) the vowel letters o and a and (2) the con-
sonant letters c and g.
Finally, a rather tougher question. One of the English checked vowel sounds
is virtually always represented by the same single letter in spelling. Can you
work out which sound it is? If you need more help, turn to p. 118.
We can distinguish between phonetic and phonemic transcription. A phonetic
transcription can indicate minute details of the articulation of any particular sound
by the use of differently shaped symbols, e.g. [m P], or by adding little marks (known
as diacritics) to a symbol, e.g. [& Ä]. In contrast, a phonemic transcription shows 
only the phoneme contrasts and does not tell us precisely what the realisations of the
phoneme are. We can illustrate this difference by returning to our example of English
/t/. Typically, a word-initial /t/ is realised with a little puff of air, an effect termed 
aspiration, which we indicate by [h], e.g. tea [thii]. In many word-ﬁnal contexts, as
in eat this, we are more likely to have [t] with an accompanying glottal stop, sym-
bolised thus: [iimt qxs]. In a phonemic transcription we would simply show both as
/t/, since the replacement of one kind of /t/ by another does not result in a word with
a different meaning (whereas replacing /t/ by /s/ would change tea into see).
Both the phonetic and phonemic forms of transcription have their own speciﬁc
uses. Phonemic transcription may at ﬁrst sight appear less complex, but it is in reality
a far more sophisticated system, since it requires from the reader a good knowledge of
the language concerned; it eliminates superﬂuous detail and retains only the informa-
tion essential to meaning. Even in a phonetic transcription, however, we generally show
only a very small proportion of the phonetic variation that occurs, often only the most
signiﬁcant phonetic feature of a particular context. For instance, the difference in the
pronunciation of the two r-sounds in retreat could be shown thus: [PeBtWiit]. Once we
introduce a single phonetic symbol or diacritic then the whole transcription needs to
be enclosed in square and not slant brackets.

Homophones and homographs
One way in which transcription can be of practical use is in distinguishing what are
known as homophones and homographs. Both of these terms contain the element
homo-, meaning ‘same’ in Greek; homophone means ‘same sound’ and homograph
means ‘same writing’. You can think of homophones as sound-alikes and homographs
as look-alikes (Carney 1997).
Homophones
Homophones are words which sound the same but are written differently. Thanks to
the irregularity of its spelling, there are countless examples in English, for instance
bear – bare; meat – meet; some – sum; sent – scent. Homophones also exist in other
languages (see p. 228 for examples in French). They’re one of the commonest causes
of English spelling errors. And unlike other kinds of spelling error, they’re not 
normally detectable by computer spelling checkers. Can you say why?

The following spelling errors would be impossible for most computer
spelling checkers to deal with. Supply a suitable homophone to correct each
of the sentences.

10 The gross errors in the treasurer’s report are plane for all

Note that homophones may vary from one English accent to another. To give one
common example, in rhotic accents (see p. 96) like General American and Scottish,
which pronounce spelt r in all contexts, word pairs which are homophones in NRP,
like father and farther, do not sound alike. Similarly, in NRP which and witch are homo-
phones, but not for speakers of Scottish English. For more information on types of
accent variation see Sections C1–C4.

Transcription is not only used to represent words in isolation but can also 
be employed for whole stretches of speech. In all languages, the pronunciation of 
words in isolation is very different from the way they appear in connected speech 
(see ‘A Sample of Phonemic Transcription’, pp. 25–6). Phonemic transcription allows
us to indicate these features with a degree of precision that is impossible to capture
with traditional spelling. As such, it is an essential skill for phoneticians. In the next
section of this chapter (after learning about some features of connected speech) you
too will get to acquire this very useful ability.
CONNECTED SPEECH AND PHONEMIC TRANSCRIPTION
Stress
A word of more than one syllable is termed a polysyllable. When an English poly-
syllabic word is said in its citation form (i.e. pronounced in isolation) one strongly
stressed syllable will stand out from the rest. This can be indicated by a stress mark [B]
placed before the syllable concerned, e.g. Byesterday /Bjestedex/, toBmorrow /teBmbrek/,
toBday /teBdex/.
10 (Answers on website)
Say these English words in citation form. Which syllable is the most strongly
stressed? Mark it appropriately: manage, ﬁnal, ﬁnality, resolute, resolution, 
electric, electricity.
Stress in the isolated word is termed word stress. But we can also analyse stress
in connected speech, termed sentence stress, where both polysyllables and mono-
syllables (single-syllable words) can carry strong stress while other words may be 
completely unstressed. We shall come back to examine English stress in more detail
in Section B6. At this point we just need to note that the words most likely to receive
sentence stress are those termed content words (also called ‘lexical words’), namely nouns,
adjectives, adverbs and main verbs. These are the words that normally carry a high
information load. We can contrast these with function words (also called ‘grammar
words’ or ‘form words’), namely determiners (e.g. the, a), conjunctions (e.g. and, but),
pronouns (e.g. she, them), prepositions (e.g. at, from), auxiliary verbs (e.g. do, be, can).
Function words carry relatively little information; their role is holding the sentence
together. If we compare language to a brick wall, then content words are like ‘bricks
of information’ while function words act like ‘grammatical cement’ keeping the whole

CONNECTED SPEECH AND PHONEMIC TRANSCRIPTION
21
structure intact. Unlike content words, function words for the most part carry little or
no stress. Only two types of function words are regularly stressed: the demonstratives
(e.g. this, that, those) and wh-interrogatives (e.g. where, who, which, how). Note, how-
ever, that when wh-words and that are used as relatives they are unstressed, e.g. the
girl who lent me the yellow hat that I wore to your wedding.
Strong, weak and contracted forms
Certain function words are pronounced differently according to whether they are stressed
or unstressed. Although few in number, they are of very high frequency. Look at this
example:
Megan had decided to fetch them from the hospital
/Bmegen ed deBsaxdxd te Bfett qem frem qe Bhbspxt3/
Here the words had, to, them, from, the are all unstressed and reduced to /ed te qem
frem qe/. When in citation form, or stressed, these would instead be /hæd tui qem
frbm qii/. The reduced, unstressed pronunciation is termed the weak form (often 
abbreviated to WF); while the full pronunciation characteristic of stressed contexts is
called the strong form (often abbreviated to SF). A select list of the commonest weak
forms is given in Table A3.1 (we have restricted it to those that are necessary for native-
speaker English).
Many function words can combine with other function words, so producing 
contracted forms (often abbreviated to CF, also called ‘contractions’), e.g. he + will →
he’ll, do + not →don’t. Unlike weak forms, contracted forms can be stressed – and
indeed frequently are. All contracted forms have orthographic representations including
an apostrophe. These spellings are regularly used in dialogue, and often in informal
writing, but only sporadically in other kinds of written English. You may have noticed
that we use them quite a lot in this book. Table A3.2 provides a list of the most 
common English contracted forms.
If you’re a non-native learner of English, remember that weak and contracted forms
are necessary for anyone with the goal of approaching ﬂuent native-speaker English.
It’s certainly fair to argue that they are of less signiﬁcance to a person learning English
as a ‘lingua franca’ (see Jenkins 2000) – namely, a basic form of communication. But
we assume that people reading this book will either be native speakers (in which case
you’ll want to know about these features of your language), or if you are a non-native
you’ll be aiming at more than bare intelligibility.
Among the languages of the world, English is remarkable for the number of its
weak and contracted forms and the frequency of their occurrence. Using them appro-
priately doesn’t come easily to non-native learners. Even if a language does have weak
forms (like Dutch, for instance) it’s unlikely that the system will be as complex or
extensive as in English.
Note that, in English, weak and contracted forms are in no way conﬁned to very
informal contexts, nor are they ‘slang’ or ‘lazy speech’, as some people mistakenly believe.
Avoidance of contracted forms is perhaps even more immediately noticeable than not
using weak forms. Again, as a non-native, you will usually not be misunderstood, but
it will certainly make your English sound less effective.

WFs are used only if the function word is unstressed. Otherwise SFs must be 
used, e.g.
It turned out that it was possible /xt t$ind Bakt qet xt Bwbz pbseb3/
2
SFs are used at the end of the intonation group (see B7, ‘The Structure of Intona-
tion Patterns in English’), even if the word is unstressed.
What was she getting at? /Bwbt wez ti Bgetxf æt/
Pronouns form an exception in this respect, retaining the WF even in ﬁnal position.
Jenny collected them /Bdneni keBlektxd qem/
3
Remember that demonstrative that invariably has SF (even if unstressed).
That’s the best approach to the problem /qæts qe Bbest eBprekttte qe Bprbblem/
Relative pronoun that and conjunction that always have WFs, e.g.
The furniture that we ordered hasn’t arrived /qe Bf$inxtte qet wi Bcided hæz5t eBraxvd/
Christopher told me that he’d written two books /Bkrxstefe Btekld mi qet id Brxt5
Btui Bbkks/
4
WFs ending in /e/, e.g. to, for /te fe/, take on different forms before vowels (see
Table A3.1).
5
In WFs of words spelt with initial h, i.e. verb forms have, has, had, pronouns he,
his, him, her, pronouncing /h/ is variable. The /h/ forms occur without exception
at the beginning of an utterance but in other contexts both /h/ and /h/-less forms
can be heard; see also p. 127. (The use of a great many /h/ forms in colloquial
English tends to sound somewhat over-careful.)
11
In which of the following auxiliary verbs and pronouns (all spelt with h) would
English speakers actually pronounce /h/? And where would it be dropped?
Jack’s handed him the money.
Tom’s handed her the money.
He’s handed Jack the money.
Has he handed her the money?
Would he have handed her the money?
Would she have told him about having been handed the money?
I haven’t handed her any of his money.
He hasn’t had any of her money.

Have/has when used as a main verb implying possession usually retains SF, e.g. 
I have an interesting bit of news /ax Bhæv en Bxntrestxf Bbxt ev Bnjuiz/. While have
occasionally enters into CFs (e.g. I’ve an interesting bit of news /axv en Bxntrestxf
Bbxt ev Bnjuiz/), this is never the case with has; compare the inappropriate: *She’s
an interesting piece of news – which would mean something quite different! (Note,
incidentally, that the asterisk * is used in linguistic work to indicate unaccept-
able forms.) Do/does behaves in a similar manner. When used as a main verb, the
strong form is used, e.g. What are they going to do about it? /Bwbt e qex Bgekxf te
Bdui eBbakt xt/.
See the ‘Brief Transcription Guide’ below for the regular pronunciation pat-
terns of ’s in weak forms of has and is.

Notice that a few common function words have no regular WF. These include:
if, in, on, one, then, up, when, what, with.
A sample of phonemic transcription
Now that you know something about stress, and also have a knowledge of the crucial
matter of weak/contracted forms, you’re ready to move on from transcribing isolated
words to doing a phonemic transcription of a short passage of English. This will 
enable us to show features of real connected speech such as sentence stress and also
all the WFs and CFs. For further detail on other features of connected speech, e.g.
assimilation and elision, see Section B5.
Here’s a short extract (slightly adapted) from Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland
(Ch. 6), shown ﬁrst of all in an orthographic version (i.e. in ordinary spelling) and then
in phonemic transcription. Note that our transcription is only one possible version 
– there can be quite a lot of freedom in such matters as stressing, the choice of 
alternative pronunciations, and much else besides.
Orthographic version
‘How do you know I’m mad?’ said Alice.
‘You must be,’ said the cat, ‘or you wouldn’t have come here.’
Alice didn’t think that proved it at all. However, she went on, ‘And how do you know
that you’re mad?’
‘To begin with,’ said the cat, ‘a dog’s not mad. You grant that?’
‘I suppose so,’ said Alice.
‘Well, then,’ the cat went on, ‘you see a dog growls when it’s angry, and wags its tail
when it’s pleased. Now I growl when I’m pleased, and wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore
I’m mad.’
‘I call it purring, not growling,’ said Alice.
‘Call it what you like,’ said the cat.

Brief transcription guide
This simpliﬁed survey is intended to start you off doing transcription and deals with
some frequent beginners’ problems. Several of the points mentioned in passing here
are discussed at greater length later on in the book.
1 Transcription from a written text
Transcription may be from a text in conventional orthography.
1 Read the passage aloud to yourself a number of times.
2 In transcribing, you must always remember that you are dealing with connected
speech and not a string of isolated words. First, mark off with a single vertical bar 
the breaks between intonation groups (see Section B7, ‘The Structure of Intonation
Patterns in English’). These normally occur where in reading it would be possible to
make a brief pause. Sentence breaks are shown by a double bar.
A most important thing to remember ¡ is to clean the ﬁlter frequently. ¡¡ This will 
ensure ¡ that the machine runs efﬁciently at all times. ¡¡
Note that for any written text, there are usually several different possibilities for 
division into intonation groups. See Section B7 for more detail.
3 Using the orthographic text, mark the stressed syllables as found in connected
speech (i.e. sentence stress). This is different from stress in the isolated word as indic-
ated in the dictionary (word stress). Sentence stress is most likely to fall on a syllable
of content words (i.e. nouns, main verbs, adjectives, most adverbs). Function words
(except for demonstratives, e.g. this, those, and wh-words used in questions, e.g. what,
where, who) are typically unstressed. Mark sentence stress thus [B] before the stressed
syllable, e.g.
A Bmost imBportant Bthing to reBmember ¡ is to Bclean the Bﬁlter Bfrequently. ¡¡ This will
enBsure ¡ that the maBchine Bruns eBfﬁciently ¡ at Ball Btimes. ¡¡
4 Now begin transcribing into phonemic symbols. If in doubt about a difﬁcult
word, make an attempt at it but go back later and check in any dictionary showing
pronunciation in phonemic transcription (e.g. the Longman Pronunciation Dictionary:
Wells 2008). Note that there may be minor differences between the transcription 
system used in your dictionary and the one in this book. Your dictionary may also show

CONNECTED SPEECH AND PHONEMIC TRANSCRIPTION
27
alternative pronunciations, possibly by superscript or italic letters. Don’t indicate all
these variants; just choose one of the possibilities.
2 Transcription from speech
For phonemic transcription of actual speech, e.g. dictation from your instructor, or
an audio recording, you must bear the following points in mind.
1 Listen to the whole passage several times. Mark intonation group boundaries.
Then concentrating on one intonation group at a time, mark sentence stress.
2 Remember that in transcribing a passage of spoken language, you cannot (as
you can with a written text) choose between a variety of interpretations. You must try
to render faithfully in phonemic transcription exactly what the speaker has uttered.
Bearing this point in mind, proceed as for a written text.
3 Writing the symbols
1 Always use the letter shapes of print rather than those of handwriting.
2 Take care with the following symbols: e c x k $ ™æ a btn 0 q g. Make sure that
you don’t confuse these letter shapes:
x i
™$
e a
æ a a
z n
n $
0 e c
k u
m Q
s t
b c a
3 Here are a few hints on how to write some of the symbols:
b is like b without an ascending stroke.
0 is written as 0 with a cross-stroke.
q is like a reversed 6 with a cross-stroke.
f should not descend below the line.
4 Some transcription do’s and don’ts
First the do’s
q
Do use weak and contracted forms wherever possible.
q
Do show syllabic consonants with the syllabic mark: bottle /Bbbt3]/, written /Brxt5/.
The most frequent syllabic consonants in NRP are /l n/; syllabic /m/ and /f/ are
less commonly found. Syllabic /r/ is very common in General American and other
rhotic accents.
q
Do transcribe numbers or abbreviations in their full spoken form. Note that 
in abbreviations the stress always falls on the last item, e.g. CD /sii Bdii/, CNN 
/sii en Ben/.
Now the don’ts
q
Don’t use any capital letters or show any punctuation.
q
Don’t include c o q x y, which don’t occur in our English NRP phonemic transcrip-
tion system. (Note that these symbols are used for sounds in other languages.)
q
Don’t use phonetic symbols, e.g. [m P Ü], in a phonemic transcription.
5 Other miscellaneous points to note
1 In our transcription system for English NRP, /e/ occurs only in unstressed 
syllables. In stressed syllables you will generally ﬁnd /w/ or /$i/, e.g. butter /Bbwte/, 
burglar /Bb$igle/.

28
I N T R O D U C T I O N
2 In NRP, and similar accents, /r/ only occurs before a vowel, e.g. fairy /Bf™iri/,
but far /fai/, farm /faim/. (See Section B2.) To indicate the possibility of linking r
(see B5), many dictionaries use superscript r, e.g. /fair/. You should never write the
superscript r, but instead where there is linking r transcribe it between words with 
a full-size letter, e.g. far off /fai r Bbf/.
3 The ‘happy words’ (see Section B3), ending in -y, -ie or -ee, have a vowel between
kit /x/ and fleece /ii/, as do inﬂectional -ies and -ied. This neutralised phoneme (see
Section B1) is indicated by the symbol i, e.g. silly /Bsxli/, caddie /Bkædi/, coffee /Bkbfi/,
fairies /Bf™iriz/, married /Bmærid/. Similarly, words like graduate, inﬂuence have a
vowel between /k/ and /ui/, shown by the symbol u, e.g. inﬂuence /Bxnﬂuens/. Note
that the neutralised vowels occur also in certain weak forms (see Table A3.1, p. 22).
4 The pronunciation of written s in plurals and verb endings, and ’s found in
possessives, contracted forms, and the weak forms of has and is, is governed by the
preceding sound.
q
Following /s z t n tt dn/, s →/xz/, e.g. buses /Bbwsxz/, wishes /Bwxtxz/, George’s 
/Bdncidnxz/.
q
Following the fortis consonants /p t k f 0/, s →/s/, e.g. Jack’s boots /Bdnæks Bbuits/,
Pat’s gone /Bpæts Bgbn/.
q
In all other cases, s →/z/, e.g. roads /rekdz/, dreams /driimz/, Sue’s /suiz/, Jane’s
leaving /Bdnexnz Bliivxf/.
5 The ending -ed has the following patterning:
q
Following /t/ and /d/, -ed →/xd/, e.g. folded /Bfekldxd/, waited /Bwextxd/.
q
Following fortis consonants (except /t/), -ed →/t/, e.g. looked /lkkt/, laughed /laift/.
q
Following all other consonants or vowels, -ed →/d/, e.g. seemed /siimd/, pleased
/pliizd/, saved /sexvd/, barred /baid/.
For several adjectives, -ed →/xd/, e.g. crooked /Bkrkkxd/, naked /Bnexkxd/. Other 
examples are: ragged, aged, jagged, -legged (as in four-legged, bow-legged), rugged,
wicked, learned, cursed, blessed, beloved.
6 A number of verbs ending in n or l have two pronunciations and sometimes
two spelling forms for the past tense, one in -ed and one in -t, e.g. spelled/spelt; burned/
burnt. In British English, the pronunciation with /t/ is more common; American English
favours /d/.
7 If transcribing from an audio recording, you must show all assimilations and
elisions you can hear. When transcribing from a written text, it adds interest to show
assimilations and elisions where these are possible (see Section B5).
Passages for transcription
Passages (slightly adapted from Alice in Wonderland, Ch. 1), graded in length, have
been provided for you to use for transcription practice in the course of reading this
book. Three are given below to start you off, and from then on there is an activity 
of this sort at the end of every unit in Sections A and B. Mark sentence stress and 
intonation group boundaries. Show contracted forms wherever possible, even if not
indicated as such in the text (i.e. transcribe could not as /kkdn7/). Keys (based on NRP)
to all the transcriptions are to be found on the website.

Transcription passage 1
And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in
a dreamy sort of way, ‘Do cats eat bats?’ and sometimes, ‘Do bats eat cats?’.
For, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter
which way she put it.
Transcription passage 2
She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she 
was walking hand in hand with Dinah, her cat. She was saying to her very
earnestly, ‘Now, Dinah, tell me the truth. Did you ever eat a bat?’, when 
suddenly – thump! Down she came on a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and
the fall was over.
Transcription passage 3
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment. 
She looked up, but it was all dark overhead. In front of her was another long
passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There 
was not a moment to be lost. Away went Alice like the wind. She was just 
in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, ‘Oh my ears and whiskers, how
late it’s getting!’
HOW WE PRODUCE SPEECH
Introduction
In this unit, we’re going to have a look at what are usually known as the organs of
speech or the speech mechanism. But one curious thing about the organs of speech
is that none of them started out that way. They are all ‘designed’ for purposes other
than speech. For example, the lungs are primarily intended for breathing; the teeth
and the tongue for chewing up food and passing it down to the stomach. This has
sometimes led scientists to call speech an ‘overlaid function’. Nevertheless, the human
being is uniquely a speaking animal, and in the course of evolution, all the organs of
speech have developed in very specialised ways often quite remote from their original
purpose. Perhaps the best example of this is the larynx (see below). This was origin-
ally merely a device for keeping chewed-up food from entering the lungs, but it has
evolved into one of the most intricate parts of the vocal apparatus, playing a crucial
role in speech.
The overwhelming majority of the sounds found in human speech are pro-
duced by an egressive pulmonic airstream, i.e. an outgoing stream of air produced
A4

30
I N T R O D U C T I O N
by the lungs contracting (partially collapsing inwards) and thus pushing the air con-
tained within them outwards. This airstream then passes through the larynx (known 
familiarly as the ‘Adam’s apple’) and along a tube of complex shape formed by 
the mouth and nose (termed the vocal tract). A variety of muscles interact to pro-
duce changes in the conﬁguration of the vocal tract so as to allow parts of the speech
organs to come into contact (or near contact) with other parts, i.e. to articulate.
Phoneticians term these anatomical bits and pieces the articulators – hence the term
for the branch of science known as articulatory phonetics, which actually forms 
the main basis of this book.
The organs of speech fall into three groupings, arranged here from top to bottom:
Location

THROAT
Phonatory system
CHEST
Respiratory system

Respiratory system
Figure A4.1
Divisions of the speech mechanism
Activity J
The respiratory system
The respiratory system consists of the lungs and the bronchial /Bbrbfkxel/ tubes which
lead to the throat. Normally, breathing in (inhalation) and breathing out (exhalation)
both take a roughly equal space of time. But during speech, the lungs take in air rapidly
and let it out slowly – in fact, about 1:8 in favour of exhalation. Speech consequently
can be seen as a type of controlled breathing.
13
Breathe in and out. Then say /ai/ as in palm. Hold it for as long as you can.
Now try making the same noise on an ingressive airstream (i.e. breathing in).
What difference can you notice?
When you did Activity 13 above, you will have noticed that it’s very difﬁcult 
to speak on an ingressive airstream for any length of time. Ingressive air may some-
times be used involuntarily for speech, for example when sobbing, or out of breath.

HOW WE PRODUCE SPEECH
31
Activity
J
Have you ever tried talking after having walked up several ﬂights of stairs? A pulmonic
ingressive airstream may also be employed when counting quickly (perhaps you
remember playing ‘hide and seek’ as a child, and counting up to ﬁfty as quickly as
you could).
14
Try to recite a nursery rhyme, like Mary Had a Little Lamb (for the words,
see p. 137), or some other familiar piece of verse, breathing in. How many
seconds can you go on for using just one breath?
In some languages certain words may be occasionally produced on an ingress-
ive pulmonic airstream (for instance, French oui ‘yes’ is often said in this way). But
no known language regularly uses an ingressive pulmonic airstream as part of its 
phonemic system.
All languages use the pulmonic egressive airstream as their main form of speech
production. But a few sounds are made in a different way – for instance the click sounds
we use occasionally to show disapproval (tut-tut) or enthusiasm. Although clicks aren’t
part of the English phonemic system, they are nevertheless meaningful in context. We
call such phenomena that function alongside speech paralinguistic features – gestures,
facial expressions and voice quality are other examples. Nevertheless, the sounds known
as clicks – made with ingressive mouth air – are actually used as phonemes in several
African languages. The best known of these are Zulu and Xhosa (two very similar 
languages) spoken in total by about twelve million people in South Africa.
The phonatory system
The bronchial tubes end in the windpipe – known technically as the trachea (/treBkxe/
or /Btrexkie/). At the very top of the trachea, we ﬁnd the larynx /Blærxfks/, which can
be regarded as the engine of the phonatory system. The larynx is clearly visible in 
grown males as a lump bobbing up and down in the neck; females have much smaller
larynxes. Try feeling your larynx – easy for men but a bit more difﬁcult for women.
The vocal folds (also called the vocal cords) vibrate very rapidly when an air-
stream is allowed to pass between them, producing what is termed voice – that is, a
sort of ‘buzz’ which one can hear and feel in vowels and in some consonant sounds.
The function of the larynx as a vibration source is termed phonation /feBnext5/.
The larynx is a box-like structure composed of cartilage, and inside it are the two
vocal folds. These can be positioned by the two cartilages known as the arytenoids
/æreBtiincxdz/ (from Greek arutaina, ‘serving spoon, ladle’, so called because the cartil-
ages were thought to be spoon-like in shape). The vocal folds temporarily close off
the entrance to the trachea so protecting the lungs from inhaling small food particles.
If this mechanism fails, as it sometimes does, we end up choking and spluttering, 
complaining that the food has ‘gone the wrong way’. Food normally goes down the
oesophagus /iiBsbfeges/, the pipe leading to the stomach, being diverted away from
the larynx by the epiglottis.

32
I N T R O D U C T I O N
We can view the workings of the larynx in the old-fashioned way without too much
difﬁculty by means of a laryngoscope /leBrxfgeskekp/, which is a smart word for an
angled rod with a mirror on the end (like the mirror a dentist uses to look at your teeth).
Or, with more up-to-date technology, we can employ a ﬁbre-optic cable by means of
which clear still and moving images of the larynx can be obtained. We have not included
a photographic image here because a wealth of material is to be found on the Internet:
an excellent website is http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/~jcoleman/phonation.htm.
The gap between the vocal folds and/or the arytenoids is termed the glottis
(adjective: glottal). We shall, for our purposes, use a simpliﬁed model of the larynx
as illustrated in Figure A4.2 (note, incidentally, that our diagrams have the front of
the larynx at the top – some of the images available on the Internet show the larynx
the other way round).
For voiceless sounds (Figure A4.3), the vocal folds and the arytenoid cartilages
are held wide apart as in relaxed breathing. This allows the pulmonic airstream to escape
freely.
For voice (Figure A4.4), the vocal folds vibrate at high speed in the airstream 
produced by the lungs. The arytenoids are ﬁrmly closed. Vocal fold vibrations are far
too fast to see with the naked eye, being comparable to the buzzing of an insect’s wing.
The vibration is constantly changing but occurs on average 130 times a second for
male voices, and 230 times per second for females. Longer and larger vocal folds

produce slower vibrations. The larger dimensions of the male vocal folds mean that
men’s voices are deeper in pitch than those of women.
The speed of vibration is termed frequency. Although the relationship is com-
plex, we can say broadly that the higher the frequency of vocal fold vibration, the 
higher the pitch perceived by listeners (note that frequency is a physical measurement
whilst pitch refers to the perception of the listener). Pitch change is crucial in language,
being the basis of intonation and tone (see Section B7).
15
Say a vowel [ai] as in palm. Prolong it. Press your hand on your larynx, 
and feel the buzz – the voicing. Now say a long [m] and feel the same thing.
Now say a long [s]. Go on to say a [z]. Prolong it. Can you feel and hear the
voicing for the [z] sound? Say [s z s z s z] and feel the contrast of voiceless
and voiced in these sounds.
16
Say some voiced sounds: [ai], [m], [z]. Sing or hum them, changing the pitch
up and down. This is easy to do with the voiced sounds but impossible with
a voiceless sound like [f].
We shall soon see how important voicing is in language. In English, it’s one of
the phonetic variables which play a part in the fortis/lenis contrast (see A5).
Glottal stop [m] (Figure A4.5) is at the other extreme from voiceless (where the
vocal folds are wide apart). The vocal folds and the arytenoids are close together so
that the airstream coming from the lungs is momentarily stopped. On the release of
the glottal closure, the blocked air rushes out with an effect rather like a weak cough,
or the noise one makes when lifting a heavy weight.

Glottal stop functions as a phoneme in many languages, e.g. Arabic, Hawaiian
and Farsi (also called Persian, which is the chief language of Iran). In English, [m] isn’t
a phoneme but plays a very important role as a reinforcement (or replacement) of
fortis stop consonants (see Section B2).

Note that because [m] isn’t a phoneme, we have to enclose this transcription
in square brackets.
Creak (Figure A4.6) is like a succession of glottal stops, one after another, sound-
ing rather like an old door creaking open. The arytenoids are ﬁrmly pressed together
whilst the front portions of the vocal folds slowly vibrate. These vibrations (about 
40 times per second) are slow enough almost to be heard individually.

Creaky voice (Figure A4.7) is creak combined with voice. Though apparently more
complicated, creaky voice is nevertheless easier to imitate and much commoner in lan-
guage. Creaky voice is common in NRP English and also in much American speech,
especially high-status varieties. In fact, if you listen to the samples of native-speaker
English on the audio CD, you’ll hear creaky voice in many of them. You can hear
creaky voice on  Track 8 of the CD.
18
Can you produce creaky voice and creak? Say a long vowel [ai], going down
the scale till it’s as low a note as you can comfortably achieve – and then go
lower again! You’ll end up with creaky voice. Now take away the actual vowel
sound leaving just the ‘rattle’ of creak.
In Danish many words are distinguished by whether or not they are said with creaky
voice. This effect, known in Danish as stød, is indicated in transcription by ’, e.g. hun
/hun/ ‘she’ (pron.) – hund /hun’/ ‘dog’. This means that in Danish creaky voice has
a kind of phonemic function.

For whisper (Figure A4.8) the vocal folds are brought together but do not vibrate.
The arytenoids are held apart leaving a gap at the rear of the larynx through which
air passes at fairly high velocity. You can hear whisper on  Track 8 of the CD.
A combination of voice and whisper is known as breathy voice (Figure A4.9). It’s
sometimes associated with ‘sexy’ voices, and breathy voice is skilfully used by popu-
lar singers – particularly women – as a special effect (to quote just one example from
a former era, Marilyn Monroe). A signiﬁcant aspect of such singing – as opposed to
the classical tradition – is the deliberate introduction of a wide variety of different 
larynx settings and voice qualities. You can hear breathy voice on  Track 8 of 
the CD.
20
Listen to some popular singers (on CD, MP3, or YouTube, so that you can
hear the same piece over and over again). What impression do you get of
any special voice quality effects that are being employed? Do you notice any
differences in the voices of male and female singers in this respect?
In many Indian languages (e.g. Hindi, Bengali) breathy voice is employed phone-
mically, some consonants being said with breathy voice and some with normal voice.

HOW WE PRODUCE SPEECH
37
In English, /h/ between vowels is often said with breathy voice, indicated by [Å], e.g.
behind [bxBÅaxnd]. In Afrikaans (spoken in South Africa), and also in much South African
English, /h/ is breathy voiced in all contexts.
The various states of the glottis can be seen as forming a kind of chain relation-
ship. Voiceless is at one extreme of openness of the larynx; glottal stop is at the other
extreme of closed larynx state. Both the extreme states allow no vocal fold vibration
and hence no possibility of voicing. Voice can be placed at the centre as the most 
frequent state of the larynx in most languages. Creaky voice and breathy voice are 
combinations of creak and voice, and whisper and voice, respectively.
All these possibilities are known to be used in language. For example, most lan-
guages employ voiced and voiceless in some way in consonant oppositions. English
has glottal stop as a marker of certain fortis consonants. Other languages, e.g. Arabic,
use glottal stop itself as a phoneme. Creaky voice and creak occur regularly in English
as a part of the intonation process. Whisper and breathy voice are heard in /h/ and
may also sometimes be used for special effects.

The articulatory system
Without special equipment, it’s impossible to view the anatomy of the respiratory 
system and difﬁcult to examine that of the phonatory system. But most of the 
articulatory system, the third part of the speech mechanism, is quite easy to see – all
you need is an ordinary mirror and decent illumination.
The articulatory system is contained in the head and throat above the larynx – termed
the supra-glottal vocal tract (from Latin supra = ‘above’, hence ‘above the glottis’),
usually abbreviated simply to ‘vocal tract’. We can distinguish three resonating cavities:
q
Throat (or pharynx)
pharyngeal cavity
q
Mouth
oral cavity
q
Nose
nasal cavity

Figure A4.11
Simpliﬁed cross-section of vocal tract showing nasal, oral and
pharyngeal cavities, as for articulation of /n/
Activity J
As the airstream passes through these cavities the nature of the vocal buzz is altered,
increasing (or amplifying) some parts of it and diminishing (or damping) others. This
is in many ways comparable to the difference made to the sound that a vibrating reed
produces once the tube and bell of a saxophone have been added to it (or other 
similar wind instrument). Alterations in the shape of the pharyngeal and oral cavities
change the shape of the resonating chambers (i.e. the cavities) and modify the quality
of the sounds produced, particularly the vowels. Furthermore, the air passing from
the lungs can be blocked off by the articulators and released to make little pop-like
explosions, or made to pass through narrowings to produce hiss-type noise.
It is convenient to illustrate the shape of the vocal tract by means of cross-
sections. Rather than having detailed, realistic cross-sections (if you want to see one
of these, go to http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/~jcoleman/phonation.htm), it is better for
our purposes to use a simpliﬁed model, as in Figure A4.11.
Pharyngeal, nasal and oral cavities
The pharynx is located directly above the larynx. At the upper end, the passageway
splits in two – one portion leading to the nasal cavity (the space inside the nose) and
the other to the oral cavity (the space inside the mouth). The position of the soft palate
determines whether the airstream is directed into one or the other.
22
Say a prolonged [m]. Now pinch your nostrils sharply. What happens? Do
the same with [n] and [f]. These consonants, where the airstream is allowed
to resonate in the nasal cavity, are called nasals. When you block the point
of the release at the nostrils, the airstream can no longer escape and the sound
suddenly ceases.

HOW WE PRODUCE SPEECH
39
The function of the soft palate or velum /Bviilem/ can be likened to that of a rail-
way points mechanism. It switches the airstream to ﬂow out in one of two ways:
(1) through the mouth (soft palate raised, giving a velic /Bviilxk/ closure), without
passing through the nose (see Figure A4.13); or
(2) through the nose (soft palate lowered, hence no velic closure; see Figure A4.12).
In the case of (1), there is no nasal resonance and the sound is termed oral or non-
nasal. In the case of (2), nasal resonance is added and the sound is termed nasal.
In all languages, most speech sounds are non-nasal. But nearly all languages have
nasal consonants, e.g. English /m n f/. Some languages (e.g. French, Portuguese, Polish,
Yoruba) also have nasal vowels, such as the vowels in the French phrase un bon vin
blanc (see Section A6, pp. 70–1).
Note also that consonants made by the back of the tongue forming a closure 
with the soft palate, e.g. English /k g f/, are made with what is termed a velar /Bviile/
closure (see Figures A4.12 and A4.13). It’s important to distinguish between velar 
closure (an articulation formed with the back of the tongue raised towards the soft
palate) and velic closure (where the soft palate itself is raised).

Look in a mirror and say an oral vowel [ai] followed by a nasal vowel [&i].
If you look at the back of your mouth, you may be able to see the velum
moving up and down and looking very like a veil blowing in the wind.
In speech much of the action takes place in the oral cavity. We’ll start at the lips
to begin our description and then work backwards.
Lips (Latin labia; adj. labial; bilabial = ‘two lips’)
The two lips can close to block the airstream, as for bilabial /p b m/ in English. Or
the lips can allow air through, being so close together that audible friction is produced,
as for the Spanish bilabial sound [β] spelt b or v, e.g. Ibiza or aviso ‘warning’.
The lower lip can also be held close to the upper teeth, as for /f v/ (e.g. fan, van).
Such lip–teeth articulations are termed labio-dental.
For vowels, the lips may be rounded (as in the English thought vowel), neutral
(as in English palm) or spread (as in English fleece). Consonants may also be 
lip-rounded; English /w/ has strongly rounded lips, and for most speakers, /r/ is 
also rounded. The lips can also be protruded – often even made ‘trumpet-shaped’, 
as for English /tn tt dn/, e.g. ship, measure, aitch, bridge.
24  Track 9
Practise lip-rounding and spreading with vowel sounds, using a mirror. Say
/ii/, as in fleece. Now say it whilst rounding your lips. You should then get
a sound resembling the vowel [y], as in French nu or German Bücher, which
we referred to in Section A2. Similar sounds exist in many other European
languages, e.g. Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish and Turkish.
Teeth (Latin dentes; adj. dental)
The term dental normally implies a sound made by the tongue-tip against or close 
to the front teeth, e.g. English /0 q/. These articulations usually pose problems for 
non-native learners of English. In the languages of the world, dental fricatives 
similar to English /0/ and /q/ are not as unusual as is sometimes supposed. One or
both are found, for example, in Greek, European Spanish, Icelandic, Welsh and in
many varieties of Arabic.
But in fact, the teeth are important in one way or another for making a whole
range of sounds, e.g. [0 q f v s z t n]. It’s really quite difﬁcult to talk without them. If
you don’t believe us, ask anyone with false teeth!

If you are a non-native speaker of English, try saying the dental sounds [0]
and [q]. Use your mirror to check the position of your tongue and teeth. 
See if you can say the dental sounds by placing the tongue just behind the
back of the upper front teeth. You should ﬁnd it quite easy to produce [0]
and [q] in this way.
Alveolar ridge (from Latin alveolus ‘small hollow’, referring to 
the tooth sockets)
Now let’s deal with the roof of the mouth. The term alveolar /ælviBekle/ implies that the
tongue-tip or blade (see Figures A4.14 and A4.15) is in contact or near-contact with
the upper alveolar ridge (also termed the ‘teeth ridge’), i.e. the ridge immediately behind
the front teeth. A large number of the English consonants are alveolar articulations,
e.g. /t d s z n/.

Put your tongue on your teeth. Move it back to the gums and the sensitive
ridged area just behind the gums. You can now feel your alveolar ridge, which
is where the teeth ﬁt into their sockets – or alveoli, to give them their Latin name.

Activity J
42
I N T R O D U C T I O N

Hard palate (from Latin palatum; adj. palatal /2pæl¡t3/)
The term ‘palatal’ means that the central portion of the tongue articulates with the
hard palate, e.g. [j].
27
Move the tip of your tongue back from the alveolar ridge. As you do so, you’ll
notice that the roof of the mouth changes from ridged to smooth. This portion
is called the hard palate – it feels hard because there’s a bone inside it.
Note that when applied to the description of sounds ‘palatal’ is only used for 
those involving the hard palate. See below for sounds formed by the back of the tongue
against the soft palate (termed ‘velar’). For /t/, as in ship, a large portion of the tongue
rises to articulate with the alveolar ridge and the front of the hard palate. Such artic-
ulations are termed palato-alveolar. Similar palato-alveolar articulations are heard 
in /n/ in measure, /tt/ in choke, /dn/ in joke. (Note that many linguists nowadays use
the term post-alveolar instead of palato-alveolar. See the International Phonetic
Alphabet symbol chart, p. 332.)
Soft palate or velum (from Latin velum /2vi$l¡m/ ‘veil’; adj. velar)
28
If you feel brave, run your ﬁnger further back to determine where the hard
palate joins the soft palate. You’ll be aware of a sensation, called the ‘gag reﬂex’,
which makes you want to vomit. Its purpose is to deter you from swallowing
large objects.
The two important functions of the soft palate have been explained above (p. 39),
namely that of (1) directing the airstream either into the nasal cavity (if lowered, i.e.
absence of velic closure) or into the oral cavity (soft palate raised, velic closure) and
(2) being used as a place of articulation – just like the other parts of the roof of the
mouth described in this section. Sounds made with the back of the tongue against the
soft palate are called velar /viile/. Note that /k g f/ are all velar consonants and have
a velar closure, but only /k g/ have a velic closure.
Uvula (from Latin uvula ‘little grape’; adj. uvular)
The velum ends in a lump of ﬂesh called the uvula. It is quite possible to see this 
organ (which does indeed look something like a little pink grape!) and to make it 
vibrate, so producing a uvular trill [y] (see Figure A5.6, p. 50). It’s much the same
kind of action as gargling. Several European languages, including French, German,
Dutch, Danish, have forms of uvular articulation for /r/, all with the airstream

channelled between the uvula and the back of the tongue. Uvular /r/ is unusual in
English but not unknown. Geordies (from the north-east of England) sometimes 
produce /r/ in this way.
29
Try to produce a uvular trill [y]. If you have difﬁculty, try going through the
motions of gargling.
Tongue (Latin lingua; adj. lingual)
We’ll now examine one of the most complex of the organs of speech – the tongue. The
body of the tongue, consisting almost entirely of muscle, is very ﬂexible and capable
of assuming a wide variety of different shapes. Although it has no natural anatomical
divisions, it is necessary for phonetic analysis to distinguish its various portions: tip,
blade, front, back and root. See Figure A4.14.
The tip of the tongue is a very sensitive organ of touch – much more sensitive,
in fact, than the ﬁnger tips – but this sensitivity diminishes as we move towards the
back of the tongue.
30
While looking in a mirror, run the tip of your tongue back from the teeth along
the hard palate. How far back can you get the tongue-tip to go? Can you feel the
soft palate? Try saying [t]-type sounds with your tongue at various points along
the roof of the mouth. Can you make a trilled [r] with the tip of your tongue?
The term ‘front’ is used for what at ﬁrst looks as if it should be called the middle of
the tongue. But look at Figure A4.15, which shows the tongue arch found in the arti-
culation of vowels. You’ll see that the front/back divisions are then quite appropriate.
Two other important facts about the tongue:
1. The sides of the tongue can be lowered for lateral sounds, e.g. [l].
31
Say [l] and then breathe in sharply. Where do you feel the cold air coming
in? Along the mid-line of the tongue, or along one or both sides?
2. The tongue can be depressed making a groove down the mid-line. This is very
important for the sounds [s] and [z].

CONSONANT POSSIBILITIES
Consonant labels
Consonants are usually referred to by brief descriptive labels stating energy, place of
articulation and manner of articulation, always in that order (Table A5.1). However,
we shall discuss energy of articulation last, since it’s the most complex.
Place of articulation
Place of articulation tells us where the sound is produced. The English places of arti-
culation are shown in Figure A5.1 (they correspond to the column ‘Place’ in Table A5.1).
Other languages and varieties of English may have additional places of articula-
tion. For instance, French /r/ is uvular, made with the back of the tongue against the
uvula; it is symbolised phonetically as [y] and can also be heard in traditional Geordie
(Tyneside) accents; see Section C2. Indian languages (and most Indian English) have
retroﬂex sounds made with the tip of the tongue curled back against the rear of the
alveolar ridge (see Section C4). Some speakers of West Country English also make /r/
in that way (see Section C2).
Some consonants have two places of articulation resulting in what is termed 
a double articulation. An example is English /w/ which is articulated at the lips 
(bilabial) and at the velum (velar) and hence is termed labial-velar.
35
Say these words and relate the consonants in bold to their places of articulation:
pub (bilabial), five (labio-dental), this bath (dental), side (alveolar), rarer (post-
alveolar), change (palato-alveolar), you (palatal), king (velar), how (glottal).

46
I N T R O D U C T I O N
Manner of articulation
Manner of articulation tells us how the sound is produced. All articulations involve
a stricture, i.e. a narrowing of the vocal tract which affects the airstream. Table A5.2
summarises the three possible types of stricture: complete closure, close approximation
and open approximation.
Active and passive articulators
The active articulator is the organ that moves; the passive articulator is the target of the
articulation – i.e. the point towards which the active articulator is directed. Sometimes
there’s actual contact, as in [t] and [k]. In other cases, the active articulator is positioned
close to the passive articulator, as in [s] or [0]. With other articulations again, like English
/r/, we ﬁnd only a slight gesture by the active articulator towards the passive articulator.

The distinction of passive/active articulator isn’t always possible. For instance, [h]
is formed at the glottis. The descriptive label for place of articulation is in most cases
derived from the passive articulator. Figure A5.1 shows the chief places of articulation
for English.

Say /t/ as in tight [taxt]. Now say /s/ as in sauce [scis]. Can you feel that for /t/
the active articulator (tongue-tip/blade) and the passive articulator (alveolar
ridge) block the airstream with a stricture of complete closure? But for /s/ the same
articulators form a narrowing through which the airstream is channelled, 
i.e. a stricture of close approximation. Now say and compare the following
sounds:
q
English /k/ in coat (complete closure)
q
Spanish /x/, the sound spelt j in jefe (close approximation)
q
English /j/ in yes (open approximation).
Complete closure
Stops
Stop consonants have a stricture of complete closure in the vocal tract which blocks
(i.e. stops) the airstream, hence the term stop. The soft palate is raised so that there’s
no escape of air through the nose. The compressed air can then be released in one 
of two ways:
q
The articulators part quickly, releasing the air with explosive force (termed plosion).
Sounds made in this way are termed plosives, e.g. English /p t k b d g/.
q
The articulators part relatively slowly, producing homorganic friction, i.e. friction
at the same point of articulation. Sounds made in this way are termed affricates,
e.g. English /tt dn/.
Figures A5.3 and A5.4 illustrate the stages in /ttdn/ as in church, judge. In English,
/tt/ and /dn/ are affricates which function as phonemes (but see also Section B2).

Nasals
Like stops, nasals have a stricture of complete closure in the oral cavity, but the 
soft palate is lowered allowing the airstream to escape through the nose, e.g. English
/m n f/. In English, as in most languages, nasal consonants are normally voiced. 
However, a few languages, e.g. Burmese, Welsh and Icelandic, have voiceless nasals
functioning as phonemes, i.e. /U V \/. Note that we employ here the diacritic for voice-
less [N] added below the symbol (above in the case of [f]).

Try imitating these examples, based loosely on Burmese words: [Ua] ‘notice’;
[Va] ‘nose’; [\a] ‘borrow’. (See Ladefoged and Maddieson 1996: 111.)
Trills and taps
For a trill, the active articulator strikes the passive articulator with a rapid percussive
(i.e. beating) action. The two types of trill that most frequently occur in language are
alveolar (the tongue-tip striking the alveolar ridge) and uvular (uvula striking the back
of the tongue): see Figures A5.5 and A5.6. But other kinds are possible – for instance,
a bilabial trill (see Activity 38).

You should ﬁnd it easy to make a bilabial trill – it’s just the brrr noise 
we sometimes use to mean: ‘Isn’t it cold!’ The sound has its own phonetic
symbol [,]. It functions as a phoneme in a few African languages, e.g. Ngwe,
spoken in Cameroon. Look in a mirror and then you’ll be able to see, as well
as feel, the rapid percussive lip action.
An alveolar trill is found in Spanish, e.g. carro ‘cart’. The uvular trill [y] is occa-
sionally heard in French – but usually only in singing. Edith Piaf, a well-known French
voice from the past, was renowned for her vibrant uvular trill.
A single rapid percussive movement (i.e. one beat of a trill) is termed a tap. Spanish
is unusual in having a contrast of a tap /?/ and a trill /r/, e.g. caro ‘dear’ /Bka?o/ and
carro /Bkaro/. In many languages with trilled [r] (e.g. Welsh and Arabic) speakers 
regularly pronounce taps, reserving the trill for careful speech.
39  Track 11
Try saying, between vowels, (1) an alveolar tap [a?a] and (2) an alveolar trill
[ara]. Then practise the uvular trill [y] in the same context [aya].
One important point concerning transcription: note that in phonetic transcrip-
tion the symbol for an alveolar trill, placed, of course, in square brackets, is [r]. The
phonetic transcription symbol for the commonest type of English /r/ (a post-alveolar
approximant, see p. 53) is an upside-down [P]. Nevertheless, for phonemic transcrip-
tion the rule is to employ the simplest letter shape possible, and consequently an ordin-
ary /r/ (in slant brackets) is used for the English phoneme.

NRP, like virtually all other types of native-speaker English, has no regular trill
articulation. Scots can usually produce a trill if called upon to do so but use a tap for
/r/ in everyday speech. Many British regional accents, not only Scottish, but also Liverpool,
and most Welsh varieties, regularly have an alveolar tap [?] for /r/. A tap was also 
to be heard from old-fashioned traditional RP speakers (one famous example was 
the legendary Noël Coward). It was used for /r/ between vowels in the middle of a
word, e.g. carry, very. Indeed, a tapped [?] is still sometimes taught by elocutionists
(prescriptive speech trainers) as ‘correct’ speech, especially for would-be actors.
40
Some people ﬁnd it hard to make an alveolar trilled [r]. Don’t despair! One
way to begin is by saying a ‘ﬂappy’ [d] using the very tip of your tongue, and
as quickly as possible. Try it in words like cross, brave, proof [kdbs bdexv pduif].
Practise rapid ‘ﬂappy’ [d] many times until you can change it into a true tap
and then extend that into a trill.
Close approximation
Fricatives
The articulators are close to each other but don’t make a complete closure. The air-
stream passes through a narrowing, producing audible hiss-like friction, as in English
/f v 0 q s z t n h/.
Compared with most varieties of English, Scottish accents have two extra frica-
tives [x Q]. The voiceless velar fricative [x] is found mostly in local usages, e.g. och!
‘oh’, loch ‘lake’ ([x] also occurs in many European languages; see Section A2). The
voiceless labial-velar fricative [Q] occurs in words spelt wh, such as which, what, 
whether, wheel. It is used not only by Scots but also by many Irish and some American
speakers.

Overview of English consonant system
Open approximation
(Central) approximants
Approximants have a stricture of open approximation. The space between the arti-
culators is wide enough to allow the airstream through with no audible friction, as in
English /w j r/. English /j/ and /w/ are like very short vowels – similar to brief versions
of /ii/ and /ui/ (an old term for these sounds was in fact ‘semi-vowels’). Note that [j]
is also termed yod after the name for the sound in Hebrew.
41
Say English /ii/ followed directly by /es/ in this way: /ii es/. If you say /ii/
quickly, you will end up with yes. Now try the same with /ui/. If you say 
a rapid /ui/ followed by /et/, you should end up with a sound close to /w/, 
and a word sounding like English wet. For non-native learners of English 
who don’t have /j/ or /w/ in their languages this is a good way to learn them.
In NRP, and most English regional accents, /r/ is a post-alveolar approximant 
– made with the tip of the tongue approaching the rear of the alveolar ridge. The pho-
netic symbol is [P]. Remember that in phonemic transcription, because one tries to
use simple symbol shapes wherever possible, it is shown with the ordinary letter /r/.

CONSONANT POSSIBILITIES

All the approximants so far described may if necessary be termed central approx-
imants to distinguish them from the lateral approximants described below.
Lateral (approximant)
Lateral consonants are made with the centre of the tongue forming a closure with the
roof of the mouth but the sides lowered. Typically, the airstream escapes without 
friction and consequently this sound is termed a lateral approximant. This is true for
most allophones of English /l/, and indeed for [l] as it occurs in most languages.
Consequently, the ‘approximant’ part of the label is usually omitted, and just ‘lateral’
is used. However, if there’s a narrowing between the lowered sides of the tongue 
and the roof of the mouth, and the air escapes with friction, the result is a lateral 
fricative.

Say [l] a number of times. Now try saying the sound, raising the tongue 
sides a little closer to the roof of the mouth, and forcing a stronger airstream
through. This gives you a voiced lateral fricative, [à]. Now try ‘switching off’
the voice. This results in a voiceless lateral fricative [/], which is Welsh ll. 
A similar sound also occurs in English (usually represented as [T]) as an 
allophone of /l/, following fortis plosives, as in close, place.
Lateral fricatives are unusual in the languages of the world but by no means
unknown. The most familiar to you may be the notorious Welsh ll. The voiceless 
lateral fricative (spelt double ll, and symbolised [/]) is a frequent phoneme in Welsh.
You can hear it in the place-name Llanelli. It’s sometimes said to be ‘impossible’ for
non-Welsh people to produce – a claim which is patently untrue, since not only do
such sounds occur in many other languages but English itself has a similar articulation
as an allophone of /l/; see above.

Incidentally, the name in its present form was invented in the nineteenth 
century – apparently as a joke, or perhaps to bewilder the English. The ofﬁcial
name is actually ‘Llanfairpwllgwyngyll’ – still a bit of a mouthful! But it’s 
known to the locals simply as Llanfair P.G. – much easier to pronounce! Even
for the Welsh!
Welsh, Icelandic, Burmese, the South African languages Zulu and Xhosa, and many
native American languages all have [/]. The voiced lateral fricative [à] is much more
uncommon but does occur, for example, in Zulu and Xhosa.

We have already mentioned in Activity 42 that English /l/ has a very common
fricative allophone which is to be heard in words beginning /pl/ and /kl/. If a normally
voiced phoneme is for whatever reason realised without voice, the effect is termed devoi-
cing. As we have seen, this is shown by a diacritic in the form of a little circle, e.g. [T].

Energy of articulation (fortis/lenis contrast)
The third possible distinction is energy of articulation (already mentioned brieﬂy above).
The English consonants /k/ and /g/ are both velar (place of articulation) and plosives
(manner of articulation), yet they’re obviously very different sounds. The same goes
for /s/ and /z/, which are both alveolar fricatives, but are clearly not identical. So what’s
the difference?

48
Say /p/ and /b/ between /ai/ vowels: /aipai/, /aibai/. Put your ﬁngers in your
ears and listen for voice. Voice ceases during /p/, but continues all the way
through /b/. Now do the same for /t/ and /d/, and /s/ and /z/: /aitai/ and
/aidai/, /aisai/ and /aizai/. Voice ceases for the consonants /t/ and /s/, but
continues throughout for /d/ and /z/.

56
I N T R O D U C T I O N
English has two classes of consonant sound: one of the /t k s/ type with stronger
and voiceless articulation and another of the /b d z/ type whose articulation is weaker
and potentially voiced. The ﬁrst class is termed fortis (Latin: ‘strong’), and the second
lenis (pronounced /Bliinxs/ Latin: ‘soft’). Consonants in English divide as follows (note
that /h/ has no lenis counterpart).
Fortis
Lenis
p t k tt f 0 s t h
b d g dn v q z n
The fortis/lenis distinction applies in English only to the obstruents (i.e. stops and
fricatives). The sonorants (nasals and approximants) do not have this contrast (hence
the blank spaces in the ‘Energy’ column in Table A5.1).
The fortis/lenis contrast in English
Most languages have a contrast of a kind similar to the fortis/lenis contrast found in
English. But the exact form of the contrast varies a lot from one language to another,
and there are more phonetic signals for the fortis/lenis contrast in English than in most
other languages (see Table A5.3 below).
There may also be very important differences in distribution. Many languages have
no word-ﬁnal fortis/lenis contrasts (even where the spelling would seem to indicate
this). This goes for German, Dutch and Russian. In German, Wirt – wird ‘host – becomes’
are said exactly the same and kalt – bald ‘cold – soon’ form a good rhyme. Similarly,
in Dutch, hout – houd ‘wood – hold’ are pronounced identically, and maat ‘size’ rhymes
with kwaad ‘angry’. Speakers of languages such as these usually have great difﬁculty
with the frequent word-ﬁnal fortis/lenis contrasts in English in pairs like life – live,
rate – raid, nip – nib.
Table A5.3 summarises the main ways in which the fortis/lenis contrast is 
indicated in English. The factors described in this table are crucial for this contrast.

Energy of articulation has been mentioned already. Aspiration and glottalisation
apply only to the fortis plosives /p t k/ and will be discussed in Section B2. Let’s now
examine the two remaining features, voicing and vowel length.
Voicing
In English, fortis consonants are voiceless, i.e. the vocal folds do not vibrate. Lenis 
consonants are potentially voiced. The word ‘potentially’ is important here. In many
languages the essential difference between sounds like [s] and [z], or [p] and [b], is
one of voicing; /p t k f s/ etc. are voiceless while their counterparts /b d g v z/ etc. are
truly voiced. This is largely true, for example, of French, Spanish, Italian and many
more. In such languages, the terms used for these phonologically opposed classes 
are voiceless and voiced.
But in English the difference is not as clear-cut. Medially (i.e. between vowels, or
other voiced sounds) lenis consonants have full voicing. Some voicing is lost in initial
position, and ﬁnal consonants are typically almost totally devoiced.
49  Track 17
Listen and repeat the following English words and note the degree of voi-
cing in the different contexts:

jar
margin
barge
/z/
zinc
daisy

The difference in initial and ﬁnal devoicing only affects lenis obstruents. The nasals
/m n f/, lateral /l/ and approximants /w j r/ do not undergo devoicing in the manner
described following or preceding pause. Consequently, in words like ram, long, wall,
moon, yell, the initial and ﬁnal sounds are both fully voiced.

Vowel length
In all varieties of English (except Scottish: see Section C3), vowels are shortened before
fortis consonants but have full length in all other contexts (i.e. word-ﬁnally, before
lenis consonants, and before nasals and /l/). This pre-fortis shortening is most obvious
in stressed monosyllables (i.e. single-syllable words) and is termed pre-fortis clipping.

Secondary articulation
It often happens that the production of a speech sound involves certain types of
modiﬁcation. Besides the main articulation, there may also be an additional secondary
articulation. The chief kinds of modiﬁcation are listed in Figure A5.12 and also in

53
Say the word sheep. Do you have lip-rounding for /t/? English native speakers
usually do since the lip-rounding is an essential part of the articulation of
this consonant and not dependent on the following vowel.
Palatalisation adds to the main articulation the raising of the front of the tongue
towards the hard palate (tongue takes on an [i]-like shape with a possible [j] off-glide).

In some languages, e.g. Russian, Irish and Scots Gaelic, a set of palatalised con-
sonants contrasts phonemically with a set of non-palatalised consonants.
French, Italian, German and Welsh have palatalised /l/ (often termed clear l) in all
contexts. The same is true of most South Wales English and much southern Irish English.
Velarisation adds to the main articulation the raising of the back of the tongue
towards the velum (the tongue takes on an [u]-like shape). It is shown by [~] written
through the symbol, e.g. [Ü]. Velarised /l/ is often termed dark l and is found not only
in English, but also (for example) in Russian, Portuguese and Dutch.
55  Track 19
Listen and repeat the following words in English: still, tell, shall, bull. And
then these words in French: style, tel, halle, boule. Note that in this context
English /l/ is dark whereas French /l/ is clear.
56
Certain varieties of English, e.g. much American and Scottish, some Australian,
have a velarised dark l in all contexts. Is your word-initial /l/ clear or dark 
in words like leaf, lame, less, look, long? What about medial position, e.g. 
willow, follow, teller, sullen?
Glottalisation adds reinforcing glottal stop [m]. The English fortis stops /p t k tt/
are regularly glottalised when syllable-ﬁnal (see Section B2). Glottalisation is symbolised
as [m], e.g. lipstick [lxmpstxmk].
Nasalisation adds nasal resonance through lowering the soft palate. It is shown
by the diacritic [~] placed above the symbol. In English, and many other languages,
vowels preceding nasals are regularly nasalised, e.g. strong man [str'f m(n].
Note that most writers consider as secondary articulations only the oral stric-
tures of open approximation (e.g. labialisation, palatalisation, velarisation). We have
extended the concept to cover two other articulatory modiﬁcations, i.e. glottalisation
and nasalisation.
Articulatory setting
In addition to differences between individual consonants, one can also consider other
characteristics of consonant articulations which have to do with the articulatory 
setting of a particular language. This term refers to shapings of the speech organs which
are continuous throughout the speech process. Setting varies from one language to another
and, within the same language, from one accent to another.
To give just a few examples:
q
Spanish is characterised by a dental setting (tongue-tip against front teeth) which
means that sounds such as /t d n s l/ are dental rather than alveolar. (This, together

J
CONSONANT POSSIBILITIES
61
with syllable-timed rhythm (see Section B6), is perhaps why English speakers have
been known to refer to Spanish as sounding rather like a ‘machine gun with a lisp’!)
q
Portuguese has semi-continuous nasalisation – something also found in much
American English (see Section C1). European Portuguese also has notable velar-
isation (not obvious in the Brazilian variety).
q
In Hindi and other Indian languages there is a retroﬂex setting so that many 
articulations are made with the tip of the tongue curled back against the alveolar
ridge (see pp. 194–5). This retroﬂex setting is also a well-known feature of almost 
all varieties of Indian English.
q
Many types of Arabic have tongue-root retraction producing a pharyngealised 
setting.
NRP English typically has loose lips, and relaxed tongue and facial muscles – 
very much opposed to French with its pouting lip-rounding, and tense tongue 
and facial muscles (something imitated to great effect by the late Peter Ustinov in 
his portrayal of the French-speaking detective Hercule Poirot). A characteristic of 
most English is to use a tapered tongue setting for alveolar consonants with a small
area of contact. Compare the blunter tongue setting for alveolars found in some 
other languages, e.g. Dutch, where a larger portion of the tongue is used for these 
sounds. The looser lip setting and the relaxed tapered tongue shape of English alve-
olars seem to be one reason why fortis stops in English are frequently realised with
aspiration.
Setting can also vary noticeably from one language variety to another. Just 
within British English we can ﬁnd several examples: West Country English (e.g.
Bristol) often has a type of retroﬂex setting; South Wales English has a tendency 
towards palatalisation; whilst Liverpool English is velarised (Scouse is popularly
termed ‘adenoidal’, presumably in reference to the voice quality induced by the 
velar setting). Pharyngealisation is characteristic of English as spoken in much of 
North Wales.

VOWEL POSSIBILITIES
Introduction
Vowels can’t be described in the same way as consonants. For vowels there’s always
considerable space between the articulators so that in terms of manner of articula-
tion all vowels are approximants. Nor can we effectively use place of articulation – all
we can do is distinguish broadly whether the front, centre or back of the tongue is
raised towards the roof of the mouth. Finally, our third variable (voicing or energy
of articulation) is of little help. Vowels are typically voiced, so that there are no voiced/
voiceless or fortis/lenis contrasts.
It is possible to use another means of description, namely acoustic data, and 
acoustic phoneticians have now made enormous advances in this area. But obtain-
ing such information and interpreting it still involves considerable time and effort. 
In language teaching, dialect research, and many other branches of practical phone-
tics, a speedy and reasonably accurate way of describing vowels is what is actually 
required.
The most generally used description of vowel sounds is based on a combination
of articulatory and auditory criteria, and takes into account the following physical 
variables:
1
Tongue shape
2
Lip shape
3
Whether tongue and/or lip shape are held constant or undergo change (i.e. is the
vowel a steady-state vowel or is it a diphthong?)
4
Position of the soft palate (nasal or non-nasal)
Finally, we have a non-physical variable which operates in a large number of languages:
5
Duration.
Tongue shape
Change in the shape of the tongue is perhaps the most important of all these factors.
Let’s ﬁrst examine the variable of tongue height, namely how close the tongue is to
the roof of the mouth. For some vowels, it is very easy to see and feel what is going
on, as you can test for yourself in the following two activities.
58
Say the English vowel /ai/, as in palm. Put your ﬁnger in your mouth. Now
say the vowel /ii/ (as in fleece). Feel inside your mouth again. Look in a
mirror and see how the front of the tongue lowers from being close to the
roof of the mouth for /ii/ to being far away for /ai/. Now you know why
doctors ask you to say ‘ah’ when they want to see inside your mouth; the
tongue is at its lowest when you say /ai/.

Now say these English vowels: /ii/, as in fleece, /™i/, as in square, /æ/, as
in trap. Can you feel the tongue moving down? Then say them in reverse
order: /æ/, /™i/, /ii/. Can you feel the tongue moving up?
As the tongue lowers, the oral cavity opens and increases in size. Consequently,
the oral cavity is bigger for /ai/ than it is for /ii/, and as a result it produces a lower-
pitched resonance.
60
Now take another set of English vowels and say them a number of times:
/ai/, as in palm, /ci/, as in thought, /ui/, as in goose.
For the vowel /ai/ in palm, the tongue is fairly ﬂat in the mouth. For /ci/ in thought,
the back of the tongue rises, and for /ui/ in goose is closer again. We cannot see or
feel the back of the tongue as easily as the front, and the lip-rounding for /ci/ and /ui/
obscures our view. But X-ray photography (and similar imaging techniques) conﬁrm
the raising of the back of the tongue for vowels like /ci/ and /ui/.
This provides us with an important aspect of vowel description. If the upper tongue
surface is close to the roof of the mouth (like /ii/ in fleece and /ui/ in goose) the
sounds are called close vowels. Vowels made with an open mouth cavity, with the tongue
far away from the roof of the mouth (like /æ/ in trap and /ai/ in palm), are termed
open vowels.
We also need to know which part of the tongue is highest in the vowel articula-
tion. If the front of the tongue is highest (as in the ﬁrst type /ii/ and /™i/), we term the
sounds front vowels. If the back of the tongue is the highest part, we have what are
called back vowels (the second type, like /ci/ and /ui/).
Although we can look into the mouth cavity, it is impossible to view directly 
what is happening in the pharynx – but this can be observed with X-ray imaging 
and similar techniques. As a consequence, we know that the open vowels like /ai/ 
have the tongue root pushed back so that the pharynx cavity is small. For the other
open vowels, and to an extent for all back vowels, the pharynx cavity is reduced 
in size.

The cardinal vowels
It was not until early in the twentieth century that a reasonably accurate system of
describing and classifying vowels was devised. In 1917, the British phonetician Daniel
Jones (1881–1967) produced his system of cardinal vowels (often abbreviated to CVs),
a model which is still widely employed to this day.
For any vowel, the tongue must be arched into a hump (termed the tongue arch),
as illustrated in Figures A6.2–A6.5. We can always distinguish the highest point of the
tongue arch for any vowel articulation. There is an upper vowel limit beyond which
the surface of the tongue cannot rise in relation to the roof of the mouth – otherwise
friction will be produced. The vowels at the upper vowel limit are the front vowel [i]
and the back vowel [u].
61
Say a close front vowel, e.g. /ii/ in fleece. Now try to put your tongue even
closer to the roof of your mouth. You will hear friction. Do the same for /ui/
in goose. Once again a kind of fricative will be the result.

There is also a lower vowel limit beyond which the tongue cannot be depressed.
This gives us two other extreme vowels – a front vowel [a] and a back vowel [a].
We have now established the closest and most front vowel [i]; the closest and 
most back vowel [u]; the most open and most front vowel [a]; the most open and
most back vowel [a].

Figure A6.6 shows the superimposed tongue-arch shapes for the vowels [i u a a].
In each case, the highest point of the tongue has been indicated by a black dot. If we
then link up these dots, as shown on the diagram with a dashed line, then we arrive at
an oval shape – rather like a rugby football (or its American football equivalent). This
is termed the vowel area, indicating the limits for vowel production (see Figure A6.7).
For the sake of simplicity, we can straighten out the lines to form a four-sided ﬁgure,
termed the vowel quadrilateral, as shown in Figure A6.8. Other vowels have been estim-
ated auditorily (i.e. by ear) at roughly equal steps related to assumed tongue height. This
gives four intermediate vowels – two front [e ™] and two back [o c]. The full series of
eight sounds is termed the primary cardinal vowels (named after the cardinal points
of the compass: North, South, East, West). The quadrilateral is then for convenience
divided up by lines as in Figure A6.9. The resulting ﬁgure is termed the vowel diagram.

What the cardinal vowel model provides is a mapping system which presents 
what is essentially auditory and acoustic information in a convenient visual form. 
The approach can be faulted in some respects, mainly in that no account is taken of
the pharyngeal cavity. Nevertheless, linguists have found it a very useful way of deal-
ing with vowel quality for many practical purposes. The cardinal vowel model has been
adopted by phoneticians all over the world and, in 1989, a vowel diagram closely based
on it was introduced on to the International Phonetic Alphabet symbol chart. The
full revised 2005 version is illustrated on p. 332.
Note the labelling system for the cardinal vowels:
[i]:
front close
[u]:
back close
[e]:
front close-mid
[o]:
back close-mid
[™]:
front open-mid
[c]:
back open-mid
[a]:
front open
[a]:
back open
In older textbooks, you may ﬁnd the terms ‘half-close’ for close-mid and ‘half-
open’ for open-mid.
Below, we give some rough indications of what the primary cardinal vowels sound
like (what is technically termed vowel quality). To do so, we use, for comparison,
average vowel qualities in familiar European languages:
[i]:
French vie
[u]:
German Schuh
[e]:
German See
[o]:
German so
[™]:
French crème
[c]:
English awe
[a]:
French patte
[a]:
unrounded English box
It must be emphasised that the above are intended only as rough guides. The quality
of the vowels in natural languages has considerable variation from one accent to another.
To overcome this problem and in order to deﬁne the cardinal vowel qualities, Jones
made a series of audio recordings, and these have served as a standard for other 
phoneticians using the system. A recording of the CVs by Daniel Jones himself can
be heard if you visit this website: http://www.phonetics.ucla.edu/course/chapter9/

Listen to the recording of the primary cardinal vowels on your audio CD;
get to know them so that you can recognise them and reproduce them with
ease. At the same time, learn to associate the vowel with its number and 
symbol and its place on the diagram. Listen to the vowels again, and repeat
them, this time using your mirror and noting carefully the shape of the lips.
Lip shape
Change of lip shape is also a signiﬁcant factor in producing different vowel qualities.
The main effects of lip-rounding are: (1) to enlarge the space within the mouth; 
(2) to diminish the size of the opening of the mouth. Both of these factors deepen 
the pitch and increase the resonance of the front oral cavity. The lip shapes of the 
primary CVs follow the pattern typically found in languages worldwide. Front 
and open vowels have spread to neutral lip position, whilst back vowels have rounded
lips (see Figure A6.10). (The UPSID survey of world languages, carried out by the
University of California, has shown that over 90 per cent of front and back vowels are
unrounded and rounded respectively; Maddieson 1984.)
The shape of the lips can be shown on vowel diagrams by means of the follow-
ing lip-shape indicators:
Unrounded, 
e.g. /ex/ in face
Rounded, 
e.g. /ok/ in goat in many American varieties.
Although front unrounded vowels are the norm, nevertheless a number of lan-
guages (including many spoken in Europe) also have rounded front vowels; this goes
for French, German, Dutch, Finnish, Hungarian, Turkish and the major Scandinavian
languages. For example, French has the rounded front vowels /y ø œ/, as in tu ‘you’,
peu ‘little’ and neuf ‘nine’; German rounded front vowels include /yi øi œ/, as in Stühle
‘chairs’, Goethe (name), Götter ‘gods’. Unrounded back vowels are much less common
but are, for instance, to be heard in some languages of the Far East, like Japanese and
Vietnamese. To cover these cases, a set of secondary cardinal vowels was devised, with

Look in a mirror when you pronounce them to check that your lips are rounded.
You can ﬁnd more information on the cardinal vowels in the Handbook of the
International Phonetic Association (1999: 10–13).
Additional vowels
Other vowels are now included in the latest version of the vowel diagram incor-
porated into the International Phonetic Alphabet. The most important of these is the
central vowel [e] (termed schwa after the name of the vowel in Hebrew and similar
to the bonus vowel of English). In addition, the following vowels are signiﬁcant
because of their frequent occurrence in languages: centralised CV 2 [x] (similar to kit)
and centralised CV 7 [k] (similar to foot). See Figure A6.12. Another vowel shown
is a front vowel between CVs 3 and 4, namely [æ] – termed ‘ash’ (from the name for
the letter in Old English). This sound is similar to General American trap.
Steady-state vowels and diphthongs (vowel glides)
If the positions of the tongue and lips are held steady in the production of a vowel
sound, we term it a steady-state vowel. In other books you may encounter the terms
‘pure vowel’ or ‘monophthong’ /Bmbnef0bf/ (Greek for ‘single sound’; note the
spelling with phth). If there is an obvious change in the tongue or lip shape, we term
the vowel a diphthong (meaning ‘double sound’ in Greek, pronounced /Bdxf0bf/; note
again the spelling with phth). For a sound to be considered a diphthong, the change
– termed a glide – must be accomplished in one movement within a single syllable
without the possibility of a break. Apart from steady-state vowels, most languages also

have a number of diphthongs; this goes for English and for other European languages,
e.g. Dutch, Danish, German, Spanish and Italian. French is the best-known example
of a language which is usually analysed as having only steady-state vowels.
The starting-point of a diphthong is shown in the usual way and the direction of
the tongue movement is indicated by an arrow. Figure A6.13 illustrates by means of
a cross-section the change in tongue position for the English diphthong /ax/ as in price.
This corresponds to an arrow on a vowel diagram.
To allow for possible change in lip shape in diphthongs, two additional lip-shape
indicators are employed:
From unrounded to rounded, e.g. /ek/ in goat
From rounded to unrounded, e.g. /cx/ in choice
Note that the indication goes from left to right as in handwriting. (These lip-shape
indicators were devised by J. Windsor Lewis 1969.)
Position of the soft palate
Nasal vowels, produced with the soft palate lowered (see Section A4), are found 
in many languages all over the world. European languages with nasal vowel
phonemes include French (see Activity 64), Portuguese and Polish. These sounds 
are common in African languages (for example, Yoruba, spoken in Nigeria) and

Duration
Duration is merely the time taken for any sound. But measuring sounds in isolation
only gives us absolute values. Duration is only of linguistic signiﬁcance if one considers
the relative length of sounds, i.e. the duration of each sound has to be considered in
relation to that of other sounds in the language.
Many languages have a phonemic contrast of longer vs. shorter duration in vowel
sounds, although very often this is combined with differences of vowel quality. This
is true of English where the checked vowels like /x/ are shorter than the free vowels
like /ii/ (see Sections A2 and B3). Similar phonemic pairs are found in, for example,
German, Dutch and the Scandinavian languages.

Transcription passage 6
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage. She knelt
down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those
beds of bright ﬂowers and cool fountains. But she was not able even to get
her head through the doorway. ‘And then, if my head would go through,’
thought poor Alice, ‘it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew
how to begin.’ For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened
lately, that Alice had begun to think that nothing was really impossible.

PHONEME AND SYLLABLE REVISITED
The phoneme revisited
In Section A2 we introduced the phoneme. We shall now return to examine the con-
cept a little more closely, and consider its place in linguistic organisation. You’ll recall
that the phoneme is an abstract unit which may be realised as any one of a number
of allophones. Allophones are the concrete entities of speech. The allophones of a 
particular phoneme typically have phonetic similarity, that is to say, they have both
articulatory and acoustic features in common (stated loosely, this implies that they
are produced in much the same way by the speaker and sound much the same to the
listener).
Taken to the ﬁnest level of analysis, no two realisations of a phoneme are ever totally
identical. Even if we ask the same person to produce the same sound under carefully
controlled conditions, there will still be very slight differences between one utterance
and the next. However, this perfectionist approach is not very useful in linguistic 
analysis. In reality, most allophones can be placed in fairly well-deﬁned categories,
and it is usually possible to provide descriptive rules to predict their occurrence in a
particular phonetic context.
Complementary distribution and free variation
Let’s take the case of the English phoneme /l/. This has three clearly deﬁned recurring
allophones (see Figure B1.1). It is possible to state, in broad terms, the chief phonetic
contexts where the particular allophones of the phoneme /l/ are likely to occur:
q
clear [l] occurs before vowels;
q
dark (velarised) [Ü] before a consonant or a pause;
q
voiceless (fricative) [T] occurs initially in a stressed syllable following /p/ or /k/.
We can demonstrate the distribution of the allophones of the /l/ phoneme with the
example in Figure B1.2.
The occurrence of allophones in this instance is therefore predictable. They can
be considered as complements to each other; where one occurs the other cannot. Such
an allophonic patterning, which is very frequent in language, is termed complementary
distribution.

75
Nevertheless, not all the allophones of all phonemes can be accounted for in this
way. For example, in NRP English the pronunciation of /t/ in words like Britain varies.
Some people realise the sound as alveolar [t] and others produce a glottal stop [m]:
[Bbrxt5] vs. [Bbrxm5]. Many speakers alternate between these possibilities. To take an
example from another language, for /r/ some speakers of Dutch employ an alveolar
[r] while others use a uvular fricative or approximant (which we can symbolise as [y]).
But some Dutch people vary between [r] and [y] in the same position in the word,
using the alveolar type on one occasion and the uvular type on another. Such variation
cannot be accounted for in terms of complementary distribution, since we cannot pre-
dict from the context which allophone will be selected. In such cases, the allophones
are said to be in free variation, implying that the realisation of one allophone rather
than another appears to be a matter of chance.
Nevertheless, there may often be additional, possibly non-linguistic, factors involved,
so free variation is not always as ‘free’ as it might appear at ﬁrst sight! It’s frequently the
case that social inﬂuences are at work, and that speakers’ use of particular allophones
on any given occasion may be determined by matters such as the formality of the 
circumstances, or perhaps the socio-economic background of the people they are with
at the time. For example, Australian schoolchildren may pronounce the vowel in start
in different ways. In the playground, speaking to other schoolmates, they might use
a ‘broad Australian’ front vowel quality [stait]. But back in the classroom, talking to
a teacher, the same pupils might employ a more back vowel [stait], which has greater
social prestige. Similarly, a London hotel receptionist might use glottal stop [m] for
/t/ in words like butter and bottle [Bbwme Bbbmá] when talking to other members of staff,
but on turning round to address a customer might instead realise this phoneme as an
alveolar plosive [Bbwte Bbbtá] to take account of the more formal context.
Furthermore, although the concept of complementary distribution is a useful one,
it can sometimes pose problems. Take the case of /j/ and /f/. In English syllables, /j/
only occurs before a vowel (pre-vocalically), while /f/ only occurs following a vowel
(post-vocalically); they are therefore in complementary distribution. However, they
cannot be analysed as belonging to the same phoneme, for two reasons. One is that
they lack any sort of phonetic similarity; /j/ is a palatal approximant, while /f/ is a
velar nasal. Secondly, and even more crucially, they could not possibly be considered
as members of the same phoneme by mother-tongue speakers of the language con-
cerned. No English speaker could ever accept that young could be transcribed as */fwf/
or */jwj/. Native speakers have an awareness of phonemes and hear them as signiﬁcant
linguistic units; differences between allophones of the same phoneme, on the other
hand, either pass unnoticed or are shrugged off as insigniﬁcant. In the ﬁnal analysis,

D E V E L O P M E N T
native-speaker intuition has to be regarded as the most decisive factor in the alloca-
tion of allophones to phonemic categories.
Neutralisation
Sometimes two phonemes may show overlap in phonetic realisation. Take the case 
of /m/ and /n/ in English, where these occur before labio-dental /f/ (or /v/), as in emphatic,
infatuated, etc. In both cases, the realisation of /m/ and /n/ may be a labio-dental 
nasal, which is represented by the symbol [9], giving [x9Bfætxk] and [x9Bfættuextxd].
In this case, there is no way (apart from spelling) of knowing whether [9] should 
be assigned to /m/ or to /n/. Both are nasal and voiced; /m/ is bilabial while /n/ is 
alveolar. Since /m/ and /n/ are never in opposition in this context, we can assign [9]
to either of the phonemes /m/ or /n/. The opposition between /m/ and /n/ has been
neutralised. We call this process phoneme neutralisation.
Other examples of neutralisation are the vowels in French pairs like patte – pâte
(‘paw’ – ‘paste’), là – las (‘there’ – ‘weary’). Traditionally, French speakers selected /a/
for the ﬁrst word in each pair and /a/ for the second; but in connected speech many
used a vowel somewhere between the two. Thus for these speakers there was potential
neutralisation of the phonemes /a/ and /a/. In present-day French this neutralisation
has become established in the language and today probably only a minority still make
a consistent contrast.
Yet another case of phoneme neutralisation is the realisation of stops in syllable-
initial clusters after /s/ in English: spar /spai/, star /stai/, scar /skai/. After /s/, the fortis
stops have none of the energy and aspiration which characterise the other allophones
of /p t k/. In fact, phonetically, these realisations are in most ways close to the allo-
phones of /b d g/. Since there is no possibility in English of a contrast of the type 
/spai – *sbai/, it would be perfectly reasonable to regard these allophones in this 
context as varieties of /b d g/, and symbolise them thus: */sbai, sdai, sgai/. But this
is never actually done even though the inﬂuence of spelling tradition is probably the
main factor for their allocation to the /p t k/ fortis category. It is interesting to note
that in Welsh phonetically similar sequences are actually spelt sb and sg, e.g. sbectol
‘spectacles’, sgyrt ‘skirt’ (although Welsh words with initial /st/ are spelt st, e.g. sticill
‘stile’). Cf. Italian (p. 232).
Neutralisation is also found in the ﬁnal sound in words like happy, toffee, Johnnie
(generally called the ‘happy words’). This vowel was formerly regarded as /x/ in
descriptions of traditional RP (e.g. Jones 1962: 68). Present-day speakers of NRP realise
the vowel short (like kit /x/) but with a fairly close vowel quality (similar to fleece
/ii/) and, if asked, many native speakers express doubt about whether this vowel 
belongs to the kit or fleece phoneme. It is to take account of the neutralisation of
these two vowels that modern transcription systems use the special symbol i (see also
Section A3). The effect is termed happy tensing.
Different systems in different accents
In providing a complete phonemic analysis of a language, account must be taken of
its different varieties. The phonemic system may vary considerably from one accent
to another, some possessing an extra phoneme contrast or, alternatively, lacking a
phoneme contrast present in other varieties. Sections C2–C4 provide much detail on

P H O N E M E  A N D  S Y L L A B L E  R E V I S I T E D
77
this question with reference to English varieties, but we can nevertheless consider one
or two examples at this point. See Table B1.1.
In most types of English, there is a strut–foot contrast /w – k/, giving minimal
pairs like tuck vs. took. However, in the north of England, broadly from just above
Birmingham up to the Scottish border, this opposition is lost in basilectal accents; all
words of this type have /k/, and there is no /w/ in the phoneme system. On the other
hand, most varieties of Welsh English have an extra vowel /xu/ giving a contrast in pairs
like through – threw /0rui/ – /0rxu/. This means that Welsh English has an additional
phoneme contrast goose – juice /ui – xu/ as compared with most other varieties of English.
Compared to NRP speakers, most Scots, many Irish, and some Americans have an
additional phoneme /Q/ that is a voiceless labial-velar fricative. This extra phoneme
provides a contrast with /w/ in pairs like where – wear, which – witch.
Most types of English have no voiceless velar fricative phoneme [x]. Nevertheless,
certain speakers use this sound in foreign names and loanwords from, for example,
German, Yiddish, Scots Gaelic or Spanish (e.g. Bach, chutzpah, Sassenach, rioja). Another
example, at least for some speakers, is voiceless [/] used in Welsh place-names like
Llangollen; see p. 54. Such sounds which are not part of the basic phoneme system
are termed marginal phonemes.
As will be seen, a valid phonemic analysis can only be made for one particular
accent of a language at any one time. It is sometimes found that the differences between
phonemic systems (see Section C1), especially vowels, are very great indeed. For instance,
accents in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north-east of England have vowel 
systems which are very different from most varieties of English.
The syllable revisited
The structure of a syllable can be represented as shown in Figure B1.3. For example,
in the word strands, /str/ is the syllable onset, and /ændz/ is the rhyme, which 
consists of the syllable nucleus /æ/ and the syllable coda /ndz/. The only obligatory
element here is the syllable nucleus, normally a vowel. If there is no vowel, then cer-
tain consonants can function in its place (see below). The syllable onset is an optional
element, as is the syllable coda. Note that the syllable nucleus plus the syllable coda
provide the potential for words to rhyme in poetry; hence the term ‘rhyme’.
We have now seen that the syllable consists of an obligatory vowel potentially 
surrounded by consonants. We can therefore deﬁne a vowel as a speech sound which

functions as the syllable nucleus. A consonant is a speech sound which typically occurs
at the margins of the syllable. (We need hardly say that we are dealing with speech
sounds here and not the letters of spelling. A word like thought /0cit/ has just three
sounds – two consonants and a single vowel.)
A selection of possible vowel and consonant structures for English syllables is shown
below.

From this it can be seen that the English syllable can consist of up to three conson-
ants in initial position (as in straw) and as many as four in ﬁnal position (as in glimpsed).
This can be stated more concisely as (C0–3)V(C0–4). Note that a syllable which ends in
one or more consonants (like sawn) is called a closed syllable; whilst one ending in a
vowel (like saw) is termed an open syllable. A sequence of consonants at the margin
of a syllable is called a consonant cluster.
In any language, there are constraints on the possible combinations of sounds 
which occur in consonant clusters. For instance, English doesn’t permit syllable 
onsets such as /pn ps vw/ but these do occur in French (examples: pneu ‘tyre’, psy-
chologie ‘psychology’, voilà, ‘there you are’). English has no /tl/ onsets, but these do
exist in Welsh (tlws /tluis/ ‘pretty’). In the onset, Spanish permits no clusters with 
initial /s/ of the type /sp st skw str/ etc., although these are commonly found in English.
All languages have CV-type open syllables. Most European languages allow both
open and closed syllables – although in some (e.g. Spanish) there may be constraints

on the types of consonant found in coda position. Samoan allows no consonant clusters
and has only open syllables, whilst Yoruba (a major Nigerian language) permits 
only open syllables or codas of /m/ or /n/. If such languages borrow words from European
languages like English, these loanwords are usually altered in terms of syllable struc-
ture. So, in Yoruba, Christmas is Kérésìmesì, and pencil is pKnsùlù.

originals. Take account also of (1) the more economical vowel system of Samoan
as compared with English; (2) that there are no /b/ or /g/ phonemes; (3) that
/r/ is a marginal phoneme found only in loanwords and sometimes replaced
by /l/.
naiﬁ, sipuni, sasa, kirisimasi, sikaleti, kapiteni, kirikiti, kalapu, silipa, parakarafa.
Some languages have more complex onset and coda structures than English. 
For instance, Polish has four-consonant onsets and codas, e.g. LdLbso /mdmbwc/ ‘blade
of grass’; warstw /varstf/ ‘layers’ (genitive). Georgian is reported as having up to six
consonants in onset position (Catford 1988: 208).
Languages do not use all the combinations possible in their phoneme inventories.
In English we can state a number of constraints which are operative on syllable struc-
ture, for example:
1
/f/ never occurs in onsets.
2
/h j w/ never occur in codas.
3
/r/ never occurs in codas in non-rhotic (see p. 96) varieties of English (e.g. 
NRP).
4
The lenis fricatives /v q z n/ never occur as the second element of an onset cluster.
5
In three-element onset clusters the initial consonant is invariably /s/.
6
/t d 0/ never combine with /l/ in onset clusters.
7
Nasals never combine with stops in onsets.
8
Nasals combining with stops in coda clusters are invariably homorganic, e.g. 
/mp fk/ is permissible but not */mk np/.1

So far we have discussed syllables in monosyllabic words but, of course, many words
are polysyllabic. In such cases we have to divide the word up before we can attempt
a syllable analysis. This is not always easy to do in a language like English which has
a complex syllable structure. To take a much-quoted example, the word extra /Bekstre/
certainly contains two syllables. But what form would these take?
1 Be + kstre
2 Bek + stre
3 Beks + tre
4 Bekst + re
5 Bekstr + e/
We can eliminate the ﬁrst and the last suggestions since they clearly conﬂict with the
formulations for syllable onsets and codas stated above. The remaining three (nos. 2,
3 and 4) are more problematical. Many native speakers would go for no. 2, taking
into account the likely realisation of the consonants in the /str/ sequence, but the 
decision is by no means clear-cut.

Take one of the ‘Alice’ transcription passages in this book and underline 
all the polysyllabic words. Bearing in mind the constraints mentioned so far
in terms of English syllable structures, try to split the polysyllabic words into
component syllables. Compare your results with other members of your class.
You may ﬁnd that they differ, since placing syllable boundaries is often a 
matter for debate.

Consonant/vowel distinction
What is it about certain sounds that makes them candidates for syllable nucleus status?
It is signiﬁcant that the sounds which can occur as a syllable nucleus are those which

have the most sonority – i.e. those which, other things being equal, have the greatest
‘carrying power’. The sonority of a sound is closely related to its acoustic make-up;
sounds composed largely of musical tones, like vowels, are more sonorous than those
which have more signiﬁcant acoustic noise elements (plosion and hiss), like stops 
and fricatives. One example of an attempt to construct a sonority scale is shown in
Figure B1.4.
Table B1.2 shows how it is possible to classify sounds in terms of sonority. On
this basis we can consider three types of sound:
q
vowels, which typically form the syllable nucleus;
q
obstruents, which are found invariably at the margins of syllables (onset or 
coda);
q
those in the intermediate category – the sonorant consonants (i.e. nasals and 
approximants) – typically occur at syllable margins but, if there is no vowel in a

syllable, certain of these sounds can function as a nucleus. We then term them
syllabic consonants (see Section A2). Such consonants are likely to be realised 
with greater energy and extra length, giving them more prominence. Look at the
examples in English in Figure B1.5.
You will note from the above that sonorants are also more likely to feature towards
the centre of syllables. This is signiﬁcant for the ordering of consonant clusters, so
that, for example, /kl/ as in clay is a possible onset, whereas /lk/ is not. On the other
hand, /kl/ is not found in coda position, whereas /lk/ as in bulk is to be found in this
context.
Compare this categorisation with how we earlier divided up sounds as vowels and
consonants in terms of manner of articulation (see Section A5). There is considerable,
even if not complete, overlap.
A consonant was then deﬁned as an articulation which involves any of the follow-
ing strictures:
q
blocking the airstream completely (i.e. stops, trills and taps)
q
hindering the airstream sufﬁciently to give rise to audible friction (i.e. fricatives)
q
blocking the airstream, but allowing nasal escape (i.e. nasals)
q
blocking the airstream centrally, but allowing lateral escape (i.e. laterals)
All other sounds, i.e. the central approximants and the vowels themselves, which involve
only strictures of open approximation, are classed as articulatory vowels.
Relationship of phonetics and phonology
In this unit we have concerned ourselves with two of the main traditional preoccupa-
tions of phonologists – namely the phoneme and the syllable. Although we have not
dealt with these topics in any kind of detail, the discussion will provide an indication
of how theoretical phonology approaches such matters, and what relationship phono-
logy has to phonetics. Phonetics provides the data for describing speech; phonology
generalises from these so as to produce deeper insights into the structures and patterns

of language sound systems. A rough-and-ready analogy is that phonetics provides 
the ingredients and phonology gives you the recipe for baking the cake.
As the word ‘practical’ in the title of this book would suggest, most of the phono-
logical aspects of the book are indeed severely practical in nature. We have conﬁned
ourselves to noting the most signiﬁcant surface aspects of the patterning of sounds 
in English (concentrating on NRP, but also comparing this accent with other 
varieties). But we have not attempted to dig below the surface and discuss what lies
behind such matters (a tremendous amount can be said about the placement of 
syllable boundaries, for example). If you wish to provide yourself with the resources
for a more thorough theoretical approach to phonology, you could as a ﬁrst step 
try reading introductory surveys such as Carr (2012) and McMahon (2002) (see the
Further Reading section). These will provide you with a basis to enable you to deal
with more complex works on the English sound system, and perhaps those of other
languages, later on in your linguistic career. You can ﬁnd a more advanced treatment,
which brings together a number of different modern approaches to phonology, in 
Ewen and van der Hulst (2001).

Stop consonants
The English stop phonemes (1) plosives /p t k b d g/ and (2) affricates /tt dn/ occur
in initial, medial and ﬁnal contexts.
Stops (i.e. plosives and affricates) have three stages:
q
in the approach stage, the articulators come together and form the closure;
q
in the hold stage, air is compressed behind the closure;
q
in the release stage, the articulators part and the compressed air is released, either
(1) rapidly with plosion in the case of plosives, or (2) slowly with friction in the
case of affricates.
See Figure B2.4 below.

Plosives /p t k b d " /
In all cases a closure is made at some place in the vocal tract:

q
back of tongue against velum for velar /k g/ (Figure B2.3).
Affricates /t) d%/
English has two phoneme affricates, namely /tt/ and /dn/; see Section A5 (p. 44) for
cross-section diagrams of /tt dn/. A closure is formed between a large area of the tip,
blade and the front of the tongue with the rear of the alveolar ridge and the front 
of the hard palate. The palato-alveolar closure is released relatively slowly, thus pro-
ducing friction at the same place of articulation (i.e. homorganic). Like the palato-
alveolar fricatives /t n/, these affricates are strongly labialised, with trumpet-shaped
lip-rounding. Fortis /tt/ is energetically articulated (though without aspiration); lenis 
/dn/ is weaker and has potential voice.

Fortis/lenis opposition in stops
The fortis stops /p t k tt/ have energetic articulation and are voiceless; lenis stops 
/b d g dn/ have weaker articulation and have potential voice (see Section A5). In 
addition, aspiration (for plosives) and pre-glottalisation are important distinguishing 
features.
Aspiration
Aspiration (symbolised phonetically by [h]) occurs when fortis plosives /p t k/ are 
initial in a stressed syllable, and takes the form of a delay in the onset of voicing, 
an effect often compared to a little puff of air (see Figure B2.6). The link with stress
is signiﬁcant; in comBpetitor [kemBphetxte] aspiration is heard on the /p/, but much less
so on the unstressed /k/ or the two /t/s; compare Bcompetent [Bkhbmpetent]. In initial
clusters with /s/, e.g. stool, spool, school, aspiration is absent. See below for devoicing
of /l r j w/ following fortis plosives.

A test for aspiration is to put a feather or a piece of paper in front of your
mouth and then pronounce the consonants [p t k]. If you’re a native speaker
of English, the paper should move noticeably.
Try the same test with the lenis non-aspirated [b d g]. The paper should move
less or not at all. Now try the clusters [sp st sk] as in spy, sty, sky. Does the
paper move now?

Figure B2.7
Pre-glottalisation in English /p/ as in laptop
Aspiration is a feature of most English accents (a few varieties, e.g. some Lanca-
shire, and most Scottish and South African English, have very weakly aspirated stops).
Languages split into two main groups:
q
those with aspiration, such as English, standard German, the Scandinavian languages
(Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic), Welsh, Chinese;
q
those without aspiration, such as Dutch, southern varieties of German, the Romance
languages (e.g. French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Rumanian) and the Slavonic
languages (e.g. Russian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Serbian, Croatian and Slovene).
Some languages (e.g. Korean) distinguish voiceless vs. aspirated voiceless vs.
voiced stops; many Indian languages have a four-term distinction (voiceless vs. aspir-
ated voiceless vs. voiced vs. aspirated voiced). Non-aspiration languages tend to have
ﬁrmer closures for voiceless plosives; the articulators form a tight, efﬁcient valve, with
a brisk release of the compressed air. Aspirated articulations have looser closures which
act like an inefﬁcient ‘leaky’ valve from which the air is released somewhat more slowly.
Pre-glottalisation in stops
English syllable-ﬁnal fortis stops are accompanied by a reinforcing glottal stop at or
before the hold stage. Termed (pre-)glottalisation, or glottal reinforcement, this is
one of the most signiﬁcant phonetic markers of ﬁnal fortis stops in many English accents.
In NRP the pattern of glottal reinforcement is as follows.
q
Syllable-ﬁnal fortis stops are regularly glottalised before another consonant, e.g.
I don’t like that fat guy [ax Bdeknmt laxmk Bqæmt Bfæmt Bgax], sleepwalker [Bsliimpwcike],
locksmith [Blbmksmx0], watchdog [Bwbmttdbg]. Note that /tt/ also has optional glot-
talisation in medial position, e.g. kitchen [Bkxmttxn].
q
In the following contexts both glottalised and non-glottalised forms are to be found:
(a) before pause: short [Btcimt] or [Btcit];
(b) before /h/, shorthand [Btcimthænd] or [Btcithænd];
(c) word-ﬁnally preceding a vowel: short of money [Btcimt ev Bmwni] or [Btcit ev
Bmwni].
q
The most frequently glottalised consonant is /t/. In particular, pre-glottalisation
(and glottal replacement, see below) very commonly affects a small group of 
high-frequency words, namely: it, bit, get, let, at, that, got, lot, not (and con-
tracted forms: don’t, can’t, aren’t, isn’t, etc.), what, put, but, might, right, quite,
out, about.

73
If you’re a native English speaker, do you glottalise the underlined stop con-
sonant in any of these words or phrases? If you’re a non-native, try using 
pre-glottalisation with the stop closures in these examples.
not true; put right; it’s got twisted; trap door; atlas; pot luck.
Glottal replacement (an effect also known as ‘glottalling’) occurs when [m] is 
substituted for /t/ so that, for example, shortbread, shorten, sit down are realised 
as [Btcimbred, Btcim5, sxm Bdakn]. This may also occur where /p k/ are followed by 
a homorganic stop or nasal, e.g. stepbrother [Bstem brwqe], took care [Btkm Bk™i].
Types of release
Nasal release
When a plosive is followed by a homorganic nasal, the closure is not released in the
usual way. Instead, the soft palate lowers, which allows the airstream to pass out through
the nasal cavity; this is termed nasal release, e.g. submit, partner. Nasal release of 
/t d/ is also heard in ﬁnal /tn dn/ leading into a syllabic nasal, e.g. shorten [Btcit5],
rodent [Brekd5t]. With fortis plosives, there is typically accompanying glottalisation,
e.g. witness [Bwxmtnes], help me [Bhelmp mi]. In present-day NRP, fortis plosives norm-
ally undergo glottal replacement in this context, e.g. [Bwxmnes Bhelm mi]. German is
notable for the common occurrence of nasal release giving rise to syllabic nasals (often
with assimilation: see Section B5), e.g. leben ‘to live’ [Bleib4], beten ‘to pray’ [Bbeit5],
sagen ‘to say’ [BzaigCf].
Lateral release
In English, /t/ and /d/ can have lateral release, i.e. the alveolar closure is released by
lowering the sides of the tongue, e.g. settle, partly, muddle, paddling. Following /t/, there
is initial devoicing of /l/: [BsetTl], [BpaitTli]. Similar tongue-side lowering is found in
the sequences /kl gl pl bl/, as in prickly, struggling, grappling, bubbly, where the tongue
takes up the alveolar position for /l/ during the hold stage of the stop.
Lateral release in NRP English often leads into syllabic laterals. In many other accents, 
lateral release is lacking and instead a vowel /e/ or /k/ is inserted, giving e.g. settle [Bsetel]
or [Bsetkl]. Of late, possibly as a result of the spread of London inﬂuence, realisations
without lateral release have become increasingly common among younger NRP
speakers. As opposed to what happens with syllabic /n/, glottalisation is not found 
in NRP in this context.
Stop sequences
Sequences such as, for example, /pt gb kd gtt dg/, as in stopped, rugby, back door,
big cheese, bad guys, where a plosive consonant is immediately followed by a stop, 
are termed overlapping stops. In such cases, the plosive has inaudible release and the 
second stop has inaudible approach.

Take a paragraph from any of the extracts in Section D and underline all 
the examples of overlapping stops that you can ﬁnd. Then transcribe them
phonemically.
In English, in a sequence of three stops, the central consonant (usually alveolar
/t/ or /d/) lacks both audible approach and release stages. In fact, /t d/ in this context
are elided in all but ultra-careful speech, e.g. clubbed together /Bklwb teBgeqe/, she looked
quite young /ti Blkk kwaxt Bjwf/ (see Section B5 on elision).
Sequences of homorganic stops result in a single articulation with a prolonged hold
stage, e.g. /gg/ (phonetically [gi]) as in big game. Where the ﬁrst of such a homorganic
sequence is fortis, the stop typically has glottal replacement, e.g. short time [Btcim Btaxm],
great day [Bgrexm Bdex].
Other types of allophonic variation
Alveolar /t d/ have a wide range of variation in NRP. Intervocalic /t/ (i.e. /t/ between
vowels) is frequently realised as a very brief voiced stop which can be shown as [Ä],
e.g. British, pretty, but I, pathetic, that I. This effect is known as t-voicing and is 
particularly common in high-frequency words and expressions. The brevity of the tap
and the shortening of the preceding vowel serve to maintain the contrast with /d/.
Unlike American English, there is no tendency to neutralise the contrast /t – d/ in
pairs such as clouted – clouded, writing – riding, waiter – wader. (See Section C1.)
75
Are you a ‘t-voicer’? Say the following words and phrases and ask others in
your class to judge.
better; phonetics; pretty; later; apathetic; not a lot of; what a pity; quite a lot.
If you do voice /t/, do you think the resulting sound is the same as /d/ or 
different? Check by saying pairs like whiter – wider, waiter – wader. Do you
also extend t-voicing to contexts before syllabic /l/, e.g. bottle, total? Or do
you replace /t/ here by glottal stop?
Nasals
The bilabial and alveolar nasals /m n/ occur in all contexts, but velar /f/ occurs only
syllable-ﬁnally following checked vowels. For all three nasals, the place and manner
of articulation is similar to that of the corresponding stops /b d g/ (see above). However,
the soft palate is lowered (i.e. there is no velic closure; see Section A4), thus adding
the resonance of the nasal cavity. See Figures B2.8, B2.9 and B2.10 for /m n f/.

The soft palate anticipates the action of other articulators, and consequently 
vowels are nasalised preceding nasals, e.g. farm [f&im], lawn [l*in], gang [g(f]. This
tendency can be very noticeable in certain varieties, e.g. most American English.

You may have noticed that when you have a cold, your nose gets blocked
and nasals come out as non-nasals. Try saying the following text substitut-
ing non-nasal stops [b d g] for the nasals [m n f].

Fricatives
All fricatives, except /h/, occur in fortis/lenis pairs. (Return to Sections A2 and A5 if
you’re unsure of the contrast between lenis and fortis consonants.)
Labio-dental fricatives /f v/
The lower lip makes near contact with the upper front teeth resulting in labio-dental
friction. Lenis /v/ has potential voice.
Dental fricatives /# !/
The tongue-tip makes near contact with the rear of the upper teeth resulting in dental
friction. Lenis /q/ has potential voice, and often has the tongue withdrawn, being realised
as a type of weak dental approximant.
Initial /q/ occurs only in the following function words: the, this, that, these, those,
then, than, thus, there, they, their, them; also in thence and the archaic words thou, thee,
thy, thine, thither.

English /t/ and /n/. Note trumpet-shaped lip-rounding
The tip/blade of the tongue makes near contact with the alveolar ridge. Air is channelled
along a deep groove in the tongue, producing alveolar friction characterised by sharp
hiss (see Figure B2.14). /s z/ are sometimes termed grooved fricatives; see Figure B2.13.
Lenis /z/ has potential voice.
Palato-alveolar fricatives /) %/
A large portion of the tongue (tip/blade/front) makes near contact with the alveolar ridge
and the front of the hard palate. The airstream is channelled through a shallower groove
than for /s z/. In addition, /t n/ have strong trumpet-shaped lip-rounding similar to
that of /tt dn/. The resulting hiss is graver (i.e. lower pitched) than that of /s z/.

94
D E V E L O P M E N T
/n/ is notably restricted in its distribution, occurring mainly in medial position,
e.g. usual, pleasure, etc. In initial and ﬁnal position it is found only in recent French
loanwords, e.g. genre, beige. In most of these cases, there are alternative pronuncia-
tions with /dn/. Remember that in initial clusters /pl kl/ in stressed syllables, e.g. clean,
please, /l/ is devoiced and fricative [kTiin pTiiz] (see pp. 54–5).
Glottal fricative /h/
Phonetically, /h/ is like a voiceless vowel. The articulators are in the position for the
following vowel sound and a strong airstream produces friction not only at the glottis
but also throughout the vocal tract. Consequently, there are as many articulations 
of /h/ as there are vowels in English (and for that reason no cross-section diagram is
provided). In English, /h/ occurs only preceding vowels.
Approximants
Lateral (approximant) /l/
The tip and blade of the tongue form a central closure with the alveolar ridge, while
the sides of the tongue remain lowered. The airstream escapes over the lowered sides.
Clear l occurs before vowels, e.g. leap, and before /j/, as in value. The tongue shape
is slightly palatalised with a convex upper surface giving a close front vowel [i]-type
resonance (see Figure B2.16 below).
Dark l occurs before consonants and pause. The articulation is slightly velarised
(see Section A5), with a concave upper surface, giving a back-central vowel [k]-type
resonance, e.g. still [stxÜ], help [heÜp]. Dark l is often a syllable-bearer, when it will 
be of longer duration [Üi], e.g. hospital /Bhbspxt3/ [BhbspxtÜi]. Younger NRP speakers,
especially those brought up in the area of London or the south-east, nowadays 
regularly have a vocalic dark l sounding rather like [k], especially following central
and back vowels, e.g. doll [dbk], pearl [p$ik]. This effect is termed l-vocalisation.
Traditional RP speakers tend to stigmatise this feature, which is nevertheless one 
of the striking changes going on in present-day English.
The allophonic distribution of clear and dark l quoted above is true of NRP and
most varieties of English, but other English accents show different patterns. For

example, most Welsh and Irish accents have only clear l in all contexts, while many
Scottish and American varieties have only dark l.

Try saying the following sentences (1) with dark l only, (2) with clear l only:
I’m told that this model will only be available for a little while longer.
Lesley feels awfully guilty putting you to all this trouble.
Delia’s told me she’ll call round at twelve.
Post-alveolar approximant /r/
The sides of the tongue are raised and in contact with the back teeth; the tongue-tip
may move towards the rear of the alveolar ridge in a stricture of open approximation
(see Figure B2.17 below). Although /r/ is classed as post-alveolar, the raising of the
sides of the tongue is probably more important than the tongue-tip movement. The
latter is in fact absent for many individuals. Most NRP speakers have accompanying
labialisation, i.e. lip-rounding and protrusion.
Activity
J
The sporadic occurrence in times past of an alveolar tap [?] in traditional RP in
intervocalic contexts, e.g. borrow, marry, has been mentioned in Section A5. Nowadays,
tap [?] is rarely heard from NRP speakers although it is found in many regional accents.
Curiously, it is still taught by elocutionists as ‘correct speech’. Another recent develop-
ment is that some young speakers (especially in the south-east of England) use a 
labio-dental approximant, symbolised as [ä]. People often use the pejorative term 
‘defective r’ for this pronunciation, and it’s sometimes imitated for comic effect.
Consequently, even though it’s increasingly heard from young speakers, it’s not 
recommended for imitation by non-natives.

Distribution – rhotic vs. non-rhotic accents
A very signiﬁcant feature of English is the split of accents into two groups according
to /r/ distribution. In rhotic varieties, /r/ is pronounced in all contexts. Rhotic speech
comprises most American varieties – including General American and Canadian –
Scottish, Irish, much Caribbean, and the regional accents of the West Country of England.
In non-rhotic varieties, /r/ is pronounced only before a vowel. Non-rhotic speech includes
most of England and Wales, much American English spoken in the southern and 
eastern states, some Caribbean, all Australian, all South African, and most New
Zealand varieties of English. Note that English as spoken by most African Americans
from all areas of the USA is typically non-rhotic.
In non-rhotic varieties, /r/ is generally pronounced across word boundaries, e.g.
car
/kai/
car alarm
/Bkai r eBlaim/
matter /Bmæte/
matter of fact /Bmæte r ev Bfækt/
This type of liaison is termed linking r. See Section B5 for further discussion of 
this and other types of r-liaison.
78
Go round your class and discover who has a rhotic form of English. If they’re
native speakers, which part of the English-speaking world do they come from?
If they’re non-natives, which type of English are they imitating?
Palatal approximant /j/
The palatal approximant /j/ is a brief [i]-vowel-like glide (Figure B2.18). In NRP, the
sequences /tj dj/ are typically replaced by palato-alveolar affricates /tt dn/ not only 
within the word (e.g. module /Bmbdnuil/) but also across word boundaries, particu-
larly involving you, your, e.g. can’t you /Bkainttu/, did you /Bdxdnu/, mind your own
business /Bmaxndnci r ekn Bbxznes/. It is also nowadays the most frequent pronuncia-
tion initially in stressed syllables, e.g. Tuesday /Bttuizdex/, induce /xnBdnuis/. Such forms,
which were formerly not accepted in traditional RP, are still stigmatised by some 
members of the older generation as ‘lazy speech’. A notable difference between British
and American accents is the frequent loss of /j/ after the alveolar consonants /t d n/
in most American English. This effect is termed yod-dropping. See also p. 158.
79
In your English idiolect, are the beginnings of these words the same or different?
chews – Tuesday; choose – tune; Jew – due; June – dune; jukebox – duke;
jewel – dual.
So do you say, for example, tune /tjuin/, /ttuin/ or /tuin/? And is duke /djuik/,
/dnuik/ or /duik/? Ask round the class and compare results for all the words.

E N G L I S H  C O N S O N A N T S
97
Labial-velar approximant /w/
For /w/ there are two strictures of open approximation: (1) labial and (2) velar. Like
/j/, /w/ is like a brief vowel glide. The [u]-like glide has strong lip-rounding.

A few speakers will strive to produce an additional phoneme contrast, with a 
voiceless labial-velar fricative, symbolised as /Q/, used in all words beginning wh, e.g. 
where – wear /Q™i – w™i/. Those who produce this sound have often undergone speech
training of some kind. Over-correct forms are not infrequently encountered. These
two examples were actually heard from BBC announcers:
Isle of Wight
*/axl ev BQaxt/
the ways of the world */qe BQexz ev qe BQ$ild/

98
D E V E L O P M E N T
It is probable that the phoneme /Q/ was extinct in the everyday language of England
by the eighteenth century. But it is somewhat more often heard in American English,
and is still a living feature of all Scottish varieties and also much Irish English.
80
Do you have any English-speaking friends or relatives who say /Q/ for wh?
If so, is it natural to them or were they taught to say it in school, or by a
speech trainer in elocution classes?
Other types of allophonic variation
Devoicing
All nasals are typically voiced throughout and there is none of the devoicing charac-
teristic of the fricatives and stops. Only when following /s/ in initial clusters are /m n/
partially devoiced [U V], e.g. smoke [sUekk], snow [sVek].
Similarly, /l/ is also typically voiced, not showing initial and ﬁnal devoicing. It 
is, however, devoiced and fricative [T] in initial clusters following the voiceless plo-
sives /p k/ in stressed syllables, e.g. plain, claim [pTexn kTexm]. (The cluster /tl/ does
not occur in initial position.) The same holds true for /w j/, e.g. queen, cute /kXiin
kZuit/. This effect corresponds to the aspiration of the fortis plosives found in other 
contexts.
In stressed syllable-initial clusters, a completely devoiced post-alveolar fricative
[W] is realised following fortis plosives /p k/, e.g. price, crease. In the sequence /pr/, 
bilabial friction may be heard. The sequences /tr dr/, e.g. troop, droop, are realised as
post-alveolar affricates, [tW dP] (see p. 95).
Palatalisation
Preceding /j/, plosives are palatalised [pj bj tj dj kj gj], e.g. pure, beauty, tune, dune,
cure, angular. As stated above, the sequences /tj dj/ are frequently reduced in NRP 
to /tt dn/, so giving no contrast between words like juice and deuce, chewed and the
ﬁrst syllable of Tudor. After fortis consonants, /j/ is devoiced and fricative [Z], e.g. pure,
tuna, cue; it may be realised as a voiceless palatal fricative [ç] (similar to the sound
known in German as the ich-Laut, in words like ich ‘I’, Bücher ‘books’). The sequence
/hj/ in huge, human is also frequently realised in this way [ç], e.g. humid /hjuimxd/
[çuimxd].
Other fricatives preceding /j/ are also palatalised, e.g. fuse, views, assume, pre-
sume. Following word-initial /s/, NRP deletes traditional /j/, e.g. suit, suicide (at one
time /sjuit Bsjuixsaxd/, nowadays typically /suit Bsuixsaxd/). These well-established forms
nevertheless occasionally suffer criticism from some older-generation speakers.
Activity J

E N G L I S H  C O N S O N A N T S
99
Before /j/ and /xe/, the nasals /m n/ are strongly palatalised, e.g. mute [mjjuit],
near [njxe].
Labialisation
Consonants preceding /w/ are strongly labialised, e.g. switch [swwxtt], language
[Blæfgwwxdn]. Following the fortis alveolar and velar plosives /t k/, as in entwine, quick,
/w/ is in addition devoiced, [xntwXaxn], [kwXxk]; the remaining voiceless plosive /p/ is
not found in this context. Note that the friction for [X] in this case is bilabial and 
not velar.
Advanced/retracted
Consonants may be advanced or retracted, dependent on the phonetic context.
Alveolar consonants are particularly prone to place variation. The plosives /t d/ are
advanced to dental when adjacent to dental fricatives (shown by means of the 
diacritic [D] below the symbol), i.e. articulated with the tongue-tip behind the teeth:
[@ {] in eighth, hid them. The same goes for /n l/ [< |], e.g. anthem, both numbers, healthy,
faithless.
For /k g/, the velar closure is advanced before front vowels and /j/ – an effect shown
in phonetic transcription by the diacritic [+], e.g. key, cue [k+ii k+jui]. The closure is 
retracted before back vowels (shown by [-]), cf. corn, cob [k-cin k-bb]. If you insert
a ﬁnger into your mouth, you can feel the difference between the two /k/ allophones
quite easily.

retracted [k−] as in corn

key
. . . . [k−]
corn
Before labio-dental /f v/, both /m/ and /n/ may be realised as labio-dental nasal
[9], e.g. in front; thus, despite the spelling, the consonant clusters in emphasis and
infant are normally pronounced identically.

‘No, I’ll look ﬁrst,’ she said, ‘and see whether it’s marked “poison” or not’,
because she had read several nice little stories about children who had got
burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because
they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them. 
For instance, a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long. If you
cut your ﬁnger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds. Alice had never
forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked ‘poison’, it is almost

ENGLISH VOWELS
Overview of the English vowel system
Let’s now examine in overview (Figure B3.1) the complete vowel system of English NRP.
The checked/free distinction
The terms ‘checked’ and ‘free’ were introduced in Section A2, but we can now say a
little bit more about this distinction. In English, checked vowels cannot occur in word-
ﬁnal stressed open syllables. This implies that there are no words like */Btx Bte/, etc.,
whereas we do ﬁnd free vowels in this environment, e.g. /Btii Btax/ (tea, tie), etc. Since
/e/ is never stressed, it must be regarded as lying outside the checked/free classiﬁcation.
As it is always short, we are discussing it here together with the checked vowels.
Vowel length
Remember what was said earlier (p. 58) about vowel length in NRP English. Other
things being equal, checked vowels are shorter than free vowels and diphthongs (e.g.
the vowel in rid is shorter than that in reed and raid). In addition, all vowels are 
shortened by pre-fortis clipping (p. 58), but this shortening effect is much more 
obvious with free vowels and diphthongs than with checked vowels.

Many NRP speakers have a lengthened trap vowel in certain common words,
such as bad, mad, bag, man; this is also true of many southern regional varieties 
and traditional RP. This is sometimes termed the bad – lad split.
82 (Answers on website)
Do you have vowels of the same length in the words listed below? Or is the
ﬁrst vowel regularly longer? (If you’re not a native speaker, ask an English-
speaking friend.)
mad – had
man – plan
bag – stag
jam – tram
If you do have lengthening of this sort, can you think of any other words
which regularly contain a lengthened trap vowel? Ask friends and relatives
the same questions.
Traditional RP front checked vowels had closer qualities, an effect which is espe-
cially noticeable with trap (making it sound amusingly similar to square to young
ears), so that glad sounds like glared. This feature is still to be heard from some of 
the older generation – one often imitated example being the British Queen. See also
Section C5 for discussion of language change affecting trap.

Central checked vowel /./ and central vowel /¡/

bonus
central mid
strut varies considerably – some speakers use a much more front quality, sounding
like [a].
In word-ﬁnal position (e.g. butter, favour, sofa), the bonus vowel is noticeably open,
and overlapping to a degree with strut. Indeed, many native English speakers seem
to regard these two vowels as being in allophonic relationship. Since /e/ is always (by
deﬁnition) unstressed, then /w/ could be regarded as the stressed allophone of /e/. For
many speakers, the two vowels in butter /Bbwte/ are very similar, or identical, sounding
like [Bbwtw].
Remember that in the accents of the north of England, roughly from just above
Birmingham to the Scottish border, strut is absent and words containing /w/ are instead
pronounced with the foot vowel /k/. See Sections B1, C1 and C2. Note that the bonus
vowel can be spelt with any vowel letter.
83
Although native English speakers outside the north of England usually 
have a contrast strut – foot /w – k/, nevertheless not all may consider 
that they contrast the strut vowel /w/ and the bonus vowel /e/. How do 
you yourself pronounce the syllable drum in the following words: drum –
humdrum – conundrum? Do you say them with a strut vowel, a foot vowel
or a bonus vowel? Or do they vary? (If you’re not a native speaker, ask an
English-speaking friend.)
Back checked vowels /( +/
/b/
lot
back open (rounded)
/k/
foot
back-central close-mid (rounded)
The checked back vowels have potential lip-rounding, but in modern NRP such 
rounding is typically very weak. foot is often unrounded and central, especially in the
high-frequency word good. See above for the use of the foot vowel in strut words in
northern England. In certain words lot varies with strut, e.g. accomplish, constable.
In some northern varieties this is extended to more words, e.g. none, one.
Worry words
Non-native learners of English often confuse strut and lot words. This is because
the strut vowel, as well as having a regular spelling with u (e.g. bus, hurry), can also
be represented orthographically by o, as in worry. We shall therefore term these the
worry words, and you can ﬁnd a list of them in Unit B4, pp. 117–18.
This is a sound–spelling relationship which is especially signiﬁcant for non-natives,
since it is a problem which affects learners from virtually all language backgrounds.

Figure B3.4
English (NRP) free steady-state vowels
The free steady-state vowels are long in open syllables, and also when preceding 
nasals, lateral approximants and lenis stops and fricatives. Before fortis stops and 
fricatives, under the inﬂuence of pre-fortis clipping (see Section A5), these vowels are
much shorter.
Front steady-state vowels /i$ :$/
/ii/
fleece
front close
/™i/
square
front open-mid
The fleece vowel /ii/ is generally realised as a slight diphthongal glide [xi], except 
where shortened by pre-fortis clipping. Compare knee (long, diphthongal) with 
neat (short, steady-state). Preceding dark l, there is usually a centring glide, so that 
for many speakers there is no contrast with /xel/, e.g. reel – real. English native 
speakers often seem unsure of how to transcribe words like feel, i.e. either as /fiil/ 
or as /fxel/. Thus, for them, the effect of dark l would appear to be to neutralise the
contrast.
The ﬁnal vowel in words like happy, coffee, movie, etc. (usually referred to as the
‘happY words’; see Wells 1982: 165–6) is nowadays much closer than in traditional
RP. Indeed, most speakers of English would regard it as falling into the fleece rather
than the kit category; this is especially true of younger NRP speakers. Traditional RP
speakers, northerners (in particular Yorkshire and Lancashire) and most Scots regard
the ‘happy’ vowel as /x/ and this is how it has until recently been classiﬁed. At one
time, traditional RP had a very open vowel in this context, sounding almost like /e/:
[Bhæpe]. This is hardly ever heard today and strikes modern NRP users as archaic.
For most English speakers the happy vowel provides an example of phoneme neu-
tralisation (see Section B1), with no clear choice possible between kit and fleece
in this context. It’s short like kit but close like fleece. This is why pronunciation
dictionaries nowadays show it with the compromise symbol i.
square /™i/ is typically a steady-state vowel in present-day NRP. For past genera-
tions, a centring glide of an [™e] type was usual, and this is still to be heard as a variant
pronunciation. In most phonetics books, the symbol for this vowel is e¡ – but 
this certainly does not reﬂect the typical pronunciation of the twenty-ﬁrst century.

their example.

The bath words
In what are termed the bath words, e.g. craft, pass, dance (see below), most British
varieties apart from NRP and those in the south-east of England choose trap. NRP,
London and East Anglia have palm in these items. Some speakers, for instance many
northerners and Midlanders whose speech is otherwise largely NRP, may retain 
trap in bath words, thus keeping a characteristic of their local speech. (This is 
often cited as an example of ‘accent loyalty’.) Worldwide, North American accents
choose trap, South Africa chooses palm, while Australia, New Zealand and the
Caribbean are variable.
The set of bath words consists chieﬂy of words where orthographic a occurs 
before (1) a nasal (+ consonant), e.g. chance, or (2) a fricative (+ consonant), e.g. pass,
task. The following list provides a selection of the commonest words.

Back steady-state vowels /,$ u$/
/ci/
thought
back mid (rounded)
/ui/
goose
back-central close (rounded)
Like other back vowels in English, thought and goose are rounded – although with
many speakers the rounding in goose may be minimal or absent.
The goose vowel is generally realised with a glide of an [ku] type, except where
shortened by pre-fortis clipping. For many younger NRP speakers a striking change
has occurred in recent years whereby this vowel has become much more fronted and
unrounded. Older-generation speakers sometimes interpret this new goose vowel as
fleece, which may cause confusion with pairs such as two – tea, through – three, etc.
The fronting is perhaps most obvious following /j/, as in news, confuse, huge, etc.
The thought vowel is the most strongly lip-rounded of all vowels in present-day
NRP English. For most speakers this vowel replaces traditional /ke/ in common words
such as sure, you’re/your, poor, and has increasingly extended to many other items.
See below.
Free diphthongs
Free diphthongs – also termed vowel glides – fall into a number of categories based
on direction of tongue movement. English has closing diphthongs (tongue rises, 
thus closing the space between the tongue and the roof of the mouth) and centring
diphthongs (tongue moves towards the central vowel [e]). The closing diphthongs 
can be further subdivided into fronting (moving towards a close front vowel [x]) and
backing (moving towards a close back vowel [k]). See Figures B3.5 and B3.6.

E N G L I S H  V O W E L S
107
Symbolisation and lip-shape indicators
All diphthongs are shown with two symbols as explained below:
q
fronting diphthongs end with x, e.g. /ex/ face
q
backing diphthongs end with k, e.g. /ak/ mouth
q
centring diphthongs end with e, e.g. /xe/ near
The diphthongs /ex ax xe/ are lip-spread throughout their articulation and are there-
fore represented by 
on vowel diagrams. The diphthongs /ke cx/ involve a change
from rounded to unrounded (represented by 
). The diphthongs /ek ak/ move from
lip-spread to lip-rounded (represented by 
). NRP English has no vowel glides which
are completely lip-rounded throughout.
Fronting diphthongs /e@ a@ ,@/
/ex/
face
front mid →x
/ax/
price
central open →x
/cx/
choice
back open-mid (rounded) →x
Traditional RP had a closer starting-point for face, a more front starting-point for
price, and a more open starting-point for choice. These may still be heard from 
some conservative speakers. In modern NRP, the glide in face is very slight where it
is affected by pre-fortis clipping but more extensive elsewhere. Before dark l, in face,
price, choice, the ﬁnal element is frequently [e], e.g. ale [eeÜ], mile [maeÜ], oil [ceÜ].

goat

Traditional RP had back starting-points for these diphthongs, and these are still 
to be heard from some older speakers. goat in particular still shows very consider-
able variation. Many NRP speakers now have a more front articulation which can 
sound similar to /ex/ to older-generation ears, leading to potential confusion with 
pairs such as cone/cane, go/gay, etc. For certain speakers, the [k] element may be 
minimal or lost entirely before dark l, making pairs such as pole/pearl, whole/hurl 
near-homophones.
Many NRP speakers born in London, or inﬂuenced by London speech, employ
[b] rather than [ek] before dark l, giving an extra diphthong of an [bk] type. This can
be heard in words like gold, revolt, etc.
Centring diphthongs /@¡ +¡/
/xe/
near
front close →e
/ke/
cure
back-central close →e
Despite the symbolisation, most NRP speakers have a closer starting-point (similar
to fleece) and may consider near words as being a sequence /ii/ + /e/. Very open 
terminations were found in some traditional RP, and are now considered by many to
be ‘affected’. Some, especially younger NRP speakers, have a prolonged [xi] vowel –
losing the glide – in open syllables, e.g. beer [bxi].
In the case of cure, again many NRP speakers have a closer starting-point (similar
to goose) and may consider cure words as a sequence of /ui/ + /e/. Increasingly, 
in common words, e.g. poor, /ke/ is replaced by the thought vowel and, for some
speakers, the /ke/ diphthong hardly exists. In words of the cure, tour type, it is replaced
by /ci/, whereas in words like brewer, jeweller it is thought of as a sequence /ui/ + /e/.
Note that traditional RP included square as a third centring diphthong of an [™e]
type which can now be regarded as a steady-state vowel (pp. 104–5).
Vowel sequences with /¡/ termination /a@¡ a+¡/
In the common sequences /axe/ and /ake/, the [x] or [k] element is generally reduced,
and may be altogether absent – an effect which has been termed smoothing (Wells
1982: 286). Nevertheless, words like shire and shower are normally distinct. The con-
trast of /ake/ and /ai/ (i.e. shower and Shah) was formerly absent in the relaxed speech
of some traditional RP speakers – but this suffered a degree of stigmatisation, often
being labelled ‘affected’. In modern NRP (as indeed in other forms of English) a clear
contrast of /ake – axe – ai/ seems to be well maintained. An exception to this is the
word our, which is commonly pronounced /ai/ not only in unstressed contexts but
also when stressed.
You can hear a degree of smoothing in other sequences, e.g. /exe/ as in conveyor,
/eke/ as in thrower, /cxe/ as in royalist. Extreme reductions such as the levelling of /exe/
and /™i/ (layer – lair) or /eke/ and /$i/ (slower – slur) are again characteristic of a type
of traditional RP which was often branded ‘affected’. These extreme smoothings are
unusual in modern NRP.

Transcription passage 9
However, this bottle was not marked ‘poison’, so Alice risked tasting it, 
and found it very nice. It had a sort of mixed ﬂavour – cherry tart, custard,
pineapple, roast turkey, toffee and hot buttered toast – so she very soon ﬁnished
it off. ‘What a curious feeling,’ said Alice. ‘I must be shutting up like a tele-
scope!’ And so she was indeed. She was now less than a foot high, and her
face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the tiny door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for
a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further. She felt a little
nervous about this. ‘It might end, you know, with me going out altogether,
like a candle. I wonder what I’d be like then.’
ENGLISH SPELLING
Now that you’ve discovered more about the consonants and vowels of English, 
it’s perhaps a good time to discuss English spelling conventions. The ﬁrst thing we
have to ﬁnd out is why English orthography is so irregular and full of exceptions to
its rules (although English spelling is not really quite as unpredictable as is some-
times suggested). The history of English orthography is long and complex. As is true
of other western European languages, the Roman alphabet – designed to deal with
the 15 consonants and ﬁve long and ﬁve short vowels of Latin – had to be adapted 
to ﬁt the needs of Old English (p. 200). Several new letters were introduced, including
‘ and — for the dental fricatives [θ, q], but all of these innovations eventually became
defunct.
From 1066 onwards, English was massively inﬁltrated by the language of the con-
quering Normans – indeed, it looked for a time as if French might even supplant English
as the language of England. Many French spelling conventions were adopted, as you
can see from the transcript of Chaucerian English (pp. 200–1). Further complications
came with the inﬂux of Latin and Greek vocabulary which were needed to deal with
the needs of scientiﬁc and scholarly work. In Shakespeare’s time (pp. 201–2), there
was much variation in orthography and considerable tolerance of individuals’ 
personal preferences. During the eighteenth century (p. 203), spelling became more 
standardised, and very similar to what we have today – a process hastened by the 
publication in 1755 of Samuel Johnson’s inﬂuential Dictionary of the English

Language. It is notable, however, that no attempt was made at any ofﬁcial spelling
reform, and consequently many discrepancies and irregularities remained. In
America, the lexicographer Noah Webster’s modiﬁcations were minor; for instance
he removed superﬂuous letters to produce spellings like color, encyclopedia, traveled
(and similar past tense forms). Nevertheless, Webster’s reforms do largely account for
the differences between British and American spelling today.
In the course of the last two centuries relatively few changes have been made to
English spelling, even though a couple of British anomalies like shew and gaol have
been superseded by show and jail. However, there have been many calls for spelling
reform, and in 1908 the Simpliﬁed Spelling Society was set up in Britain (an American
Simpliﬁed Spelling Board already existed). It gained the support of many well-known
ﬁgures – notably the playwright Bernard Shaw, who attempted to leave all of his huge
fortune to the cause of spelling reform (his will was subsequently bitterly contested
in the courts). Under its new name – the English Spelling Society – it’s still very much
a going concern, and has a phonetician, John Wells, as its president, and counts several
linguists amongst its supporters. You can access its website at http://spellingsociety.org.
A major project in the 1960s was the Initial Teaching Alphabet, designed by James
Pitman (1901–85) to introduce children to reading on an essentially one symbol 
to one speech sound basis. Although it had considerable success in its aims, British
teachers lost interest in it, and it was eventually abandoned. The ITA still has adher-
ents in the USA, where it is used in some schools, in particular for teaching English
spelling to American Hispanic children. There is more information at this website:
http://www.itafoundation.org/.
The arguments in favour of spelling reform are very powerful. Research has
conﬁrmed that far more time is needed for an English-speaking child to learn to read
than is the case for children in countries with languages with more rational spelling
systems like Finnish or Spanish. Functional illiteracy is known to be a major problem
in job training, and there have been suggestions that the high degree of illiteracy found
in the prison population might indicate that the over-complex orthography of English
could even help foster some kinds of criminality.
However, the difﬁculties of introducing spelling reform should not be under-
estimated. Wherever it has been attempted, there has always been great public 
resistance to any change. In the case of English, with its unique position as a world
language, reform would require government co-operation on an international scale.
Furthermore, English is spoken all over the world in many different accents, and a
reformed alphabet would have to take into account all the varying pronunciation 
of its many users. This is the point discussed by John Wells in his piece in Section D
(pp. 279–85).
Nevertheless, it is reassuring to realise that English spelling is really far less
chaotic than might at ﬁrst be thought. In fact, the vast majority of words are pro-
nounced according to deﬁnable rules and the number of exceptional words going against
these patterns is actually rather small – even though these are unfortunately amongst
the commonest words in the language. The difﬁculties experienced by native speak-
ers of English derive from the fact that they are normally well aware of how to 
pronounce a word, but have trouble in knowing how to write it. This is because they
usually encounter the spoken form of the word ﬁrst. For non-natives, the reverse is

E N G L I S H  S P E L L I N G
111
generally true. They ﬁrst learn the written form of the word, but may easily have an
incorrect impression of how the word is pronounced. In the remainder of this Unit,
we shall try to give you some idea of certain useful spelling-to-sound relationships
(graphophonemic patterns, as they are technically termed) so as to provide guidelines
to help non-native speakers with English pronunciation. Learning about these pat-
terns will help you to cope with some of the vagaries of English spelling, by enabling
you to link the orthographic form of the word to its phonemic form. Similar grapho-
phonemic guides can also be found in the two best-known pronunciation diction-
aries, the Longman Pronunciation Dictionary (Wells 2008) and the Cambridge English
Pronouncing Dictionary (Jones 2011). A useful little book devoted solely to the topic
of spelling is Carney’s (1997) English Spelling. A more recent, and very readable, pub-
lication on English spelling, covering many different aspects of the topic, is Crystal’s
(2012) Spell it Out.
Note
Note that in the sections that follow, the warning triangle 
indicates an exception
to the general guideline or pattern.1
Spelling guidelines 1: letters <c> and <ch>
Letter <c>
Orthographic c is pronounced mainly in two ways: either /k/ or /s/, popularly termed
‘hard c’ and ‘soft c’ respectively.
<c>
/k/ (‘hard c’)
/s/ (‘soft c’)
1. Preceding a, o, u e.g. cat, cot, cut; in 
initial consonant clusters, e.g. clap, creak;
and when ﬁnal, e.g. music.
2. Coda combination ck is always pro-
nounced k, e.g. block, sticks.
1. Preceding e, i, y: cease, city,
cymbals, grace, icicle, bicycle.
(Word-ﬁnal ce always repre-
sents /s/ and never /z/, e.g. mice,
space.)
Note
Preceding ia, ea, ie, io in unstressed syllables, c is said as /t/, e.g. special, ocean, ancient,
precious, suspicion. Note pronunciation, society, where /s/ occurs: /prenwnsiBext5,
seBsaxeti/.
Letter combination <ch>
The letter combination ch is pronounced in three ways.
1 Many of these guidelines ﬁrst appeared in Sounds of English and Dutch, Collins and Mees (1981).

112
D E V E L O P M E N T
Spelling guidelines 2: letter <g>
Letter g is pronounced in two main ways: either /g/ or /dn/, popularly termed ‘hard
g’ and ‘soft g’ respectively. Note that g also occurs in several letter combinations, as
detailed below.
<ch>
/ttt/
/tt/
/k/
<g>
/gg/ (‘hard g’)
/dnn/ (‘soft g’)
1. Before a, o, u, e.g. gap, goat, gun.
margarine with /dn/
2. gu and gue: here letters u or ue merely indicate
a hard g and are silent, e.g. guess, guise, league,
intrigue.
3. ng gives /f/ in tongue /twf/, meringue /meBræf/,
and ngu /fgw/: lingual, extinguish.
4. Intervocalic ng has two possibilities. If the
word is derived from a verb, it is pronounced /f/,
e.g. singer, hanger, longing; if not derived from a
verb, it is pronounced /fg/, e.g. anger, ﬁnger.
Compare longing /Blbfxf/ from to long, and longer
/Blbfge/ from adj. long.
5. gh gives /g/ initially and medially:
ghastly, ghost, spaghetti
6. Final gh gives /f/ (also in sequence ght): rough
/rwf/, cough /kbf/, laugh /la£f/ draught /dra£ft/.
See section on silent letters below for silent gh as
in though, daughter.
gg gives /g/, e.g. luggage, dagger.
suggest /seBdnest/
1. Before e, i, y, e.g. gesture, general,
gin, danger, gibberish, gymnasium,
energy, magic.
There are many exceptions to this
guideline, 
especially 
in 
common
words, e.g. gear, get, give, together,
begin, eager.
Regular form: chicken, cheek,
achieve, peach
Note
Combination tch is regularly
pronounced /tt/, e.g. patch,
kitchen.
/t/ in recent French loans:
charlatan, champagne, chic,
chef, 
chassis, 
brochure,
machine, parachute
In scientiﬁc, medical and other
learned words (mostly derived
from 
Greek), 
e.g. 
chaos,
chemist, architecture, archives,
epoch, stomach, mechanism,
psychologist, hierarchy, ache

Spelling guidelines 3: letters <s> and <se>
<s>
/s/
/z/
1. Initial s regular form: sit, sun, stick.
2. Medial between vowels (including y): /s/
is rather more common:
a) Preﬁxes: mis-, dis-, e.g. misunderstand, mis-
use, disapprove, disobey.
/z/ in disease.
b) Longer words (three syllables or more)
ending in -sy: hypocrisy, ecstasy.
c) -ss-: /s/ in assert, assess, essay.
/z/ in dessert, possess, scissors, dissolve.
d) sch: /sk/ in scheme, schism, scholar, school.
/t/ in schwa; /t/ or /sk/ in schedule.
1. Initial z always /z/, never /s/, e.g.
zebra, zinc, zoo.
2. Medial between vowels (including y):
/z/ is less common, but does occur in
some high-frequency words:
a) Preﬁxes: de-, pre-, re- followed by
a stressed syllable beginning s, e.g.
design, preserve, resent.
b) Short words ending in -sy, e.g.
busy, clumsy, cosy, drowsy, easy, flimsy,
lousy, noisy, queasy
<se>
/s/
/z/
(less commonly)
aise: no example

Spelling guidelines 7: TRAP, DRESS and SQUARE /æ e :$/
1. Spelling of TRAP /æ/
1.1. The trap vowel is virtually always spelt a, e.g. cab, bat, saddle. There are just two
exceptions with ai:
ai in plaid, plait
1.2. are usually represents /™£/ square (see below).
1.3. ar followed by any vowel except e represents trap, e.g. carol, aristocratic, 
charity, Paris, comparison, barbaric (cf. barbarian /ba£Bb™£rien/), maritime, baritone,
arr usually represents trap (and never square), e.g. marry, embarrass, carrot, narrow.
2. Spelling of DRESS
2.1. The dress vowel is in almost all cases spelt either as e or ea, e.g. bet, leg, help,
steady, sweat, instead.

E N G L I S H  S P E L L I N G
119
a . . . y, a . . . e any, many, ate, Thames. Note that ate, traditionally /et/, is 
increasingly pronounced /ext/.
ai, ay said, again, against (also /eBgexn, eBgexnst), says /sez/
Some oddities are: friend, Geoffrey /Bdnefri/, Leicester /Bleste/, leisure /Blene/, bury
/Bberi/, burial /Bberiel/.
3. Spelling of SQUARE /:$/
3.1. The square vowel is overwhelmingly spelt are or air, e.g. care, share, rare, square,
aware, compare, parent, air, fair, chair, dairy, fairy, prairie.
apparent /eBpærent/
3.2. Note also: ary and sufﬁxes -arious, -arian, e.g. wary, vary, Mary, hilarious, vari-
ous, barbarian, vegetarian, and ari (in)variable /Bv™rieb3/, variant /Bv™irient/.
ear in bear, pear, swear, to tear, wear
ay mayor /m™£/, prayer /pr™£/; eir, heir /™£/, heiress /B™£res/; their. Note their, there
and they’re: all three words are pronounced /q™£/.
ar Sarah /Bs™£re/; scarce /sk™£s/, scarcity /Bsk™£seti/
Spelling guidelines 8: FOOT /+/ and GOOSE /u$/
Non-native English speakers often experience difﬁculty deciding which words are to
be said with goose and which with foot. But this is easily sorted out. The spellings
are reasonably regular and it’s well worthwhile learning the main patterns.
1. Spellings for FOOT
There are only three common spellings for the foot vowel. It occurs in very few words
– but note that these include some of the commonest items in the language. It’s easy
to learn all the important words containing foot merely by committing to memory
the following list. High-frequency words are listed ﬁrst and shown in bold.
1.1 Spellings with <oo>
ood
good, hood (also as sufﬁx -hood: childhood, manhood, womanhood, etc.),
wood(-en), stood
ook
Almost all words with ook are pronounced with foot
book, cook(-ery), crook, crooked /Bkrkkxd/, hook, look, shook, took, 
brook, nook, rook
snooker, spook (both with goose)
ool
wool, woolly, woollen
oot
foot (and footing, footloose /Bfktlu£s/), soot(y)
1.2 Spelling <o>
o
woman,2 bosom /Bbkzem/, wolf, Worcester /Bwkste/
2 Note that plural women is /Bwxmxn/.

120
D E V E L O P M E N T
1.3 Spellings with <u>
These mostly precede either l or sh. (Think of a door marked pull on one side and
push on the other!)
ul or ull
full, -ful (e.g. mouthful),3 pull, bull (and derivatives, e.g. bulldozer),
bullet, bulletin /Bbkletxn/, bullock, bully, fulﬁl, fulsome, pullet, pulley,
pullover, pulpit
ush
bush, push, bushel, ambush, cushion
Note also:
put, sugar, butch, butcher, cuckoo, pudding, puss(y)
ould
as strong form for verbs could, should, would
2. Spellings for GOOSE
2.1 The goose vowel has a lot of different spellings, but only three: oo, u, o, overlap
with those of the foot vowel.
oo
boot, food, mood, proof, noon, soon, spoon, room, fool, too
u
duty, music, truth, ruthless
o
do, who, two, to, tomb /tu£m/, womb /wu£m/

Common words with unusual spellings: beauty, canoe /keBnu£/, shoe
FEATURES OF CONNECTED SPEECH
The surprises of connected speech
All languages modify complicated sequences in connected speech in order to simplify
the articulation process – but the manner in which this is done varies from one 
language to another. Furthermore, most native speakers are totally unaware of such
simpliﬁcation processes and are often surprised (or even shocked!) when these are
pointed out to them.
The differences between the citation forms and the modiﬁed connected speech
forms are not just a matter of chance: clear patterns are distinguishable.
3 -ful varies, e.g. mouthful can be either /Bmakθfkl/ or  /Bmakθfel/.

Phonetic conditioning
Phonetic conditioning is a term used to cover the way in which speech segments are
inﬂuenced by adjacent (or near-adjacent) segments, causing phonemes to vary in their
realisation according to the phonetic context. We can distinguish three main types:
(1) allophonic variation; (2) assimilation; (3) elision.
Throughout the sections on English segments, we have discussed deviations 
from the target forms of phonemes. These result from phonetic conditioning and 
are responsible for much of any range of allophones occurring in complementary 
distribution. We shall now proceed to deal with the two other types of phonetic 
conditioning.
Assimilation
Where, as a result of phonetic conditioning, one phoneme is effectively replaced by
a second under the inﬂuence of a third, we term the process assimilation.
Take the English word broadcast, which in careful pronunciation is /Bbrcidkaist/,
but in connected speech may well become /Bbrcigkaist/. Here, one phoneme /d/ has
been replaced by a second /g/ under the inﬂuence of a third /k/. This could be stated
as a rule:
/d/
→
/g/
before /k/
We can distinguish here the two forms of the word broad: (1) /brcid/, (2) /brcig/, where
form (1) can be considered the ideal form, corresponding to the target that native
speakers have in their minds. This is what is produced in the slowest and most careful
styles of speech; it often bears a close resemblance to the spelling representation. Form
(2), more typical of connected speech, is termed the assimilated form.
Patterns of assimilation in English
Direction of inﬂuence
1
Features of an articulation may lead into (i.e. anticipate) those of a following 
segment, e.g. English white pepper /waxt Bpepe/ →/waxp Bpepe/. We term this 
leading assimilation.

122
D E V E L O P M E N T
2
Articulation features may be held over from a preceding segment, so that the 
articulators lag in their movements, e.g. English on the house /bn qe Bhaks/ →
/bn ne Bhaks/. This we term lagging assimilation.
In many cases there is a two-way exchange of articulation features, e.g. English raise
your glass /Brexz jci Bglais/ →/Brexn nci Bglais/. This is termed reciprocal assimilation.
Types of inﬂuence
1
Assimilations involving a change in place of articulation are termed place 
assimilations. For instance, ﬁnal alveolars in ideal forms are often replaced 
by bilabials (preceding /p b m/) or velars (preceding /k g/) or palato-alveolars 
(preceding /t/), e.g. woodpecker /Bwkdpeke/ →/Bwkbpeke/, wet blanket /wet
Bblæfkxt/ →/wep Bblæfkxt/, statement /Bstextment/ →/Bstexpment/, night-cap
/Bnaxtkæp/ →/Bnaxkkæp/, weed-killer /Bwiid kxle/ →/Bwiig kxle/, horseshoe
/Bhcistui/ →/Bhcittui/. Place assimilation is very common in English.
2
Assimilations may involve a reduction of the fortis/lenis contrast, a type which 
is termed energy assimilation. In stressed syllables, energy assimilations are 
less frequent in English than in most other languages, but they do occur in a 
few common words and phrases, e.g. newspaper /Bnjuizpexpe/ →/Bnjuispexpe/. In
two verb forms, have to (meaning ‘must’) and used to, this type of assimilation is
so common as to be effectively obligatory: I have to do it /ax Bhæfte Bdui xt/, I used
to do it /ax Bjuiste Bdui xt/. In unstressed syllables, they occur regularly, e.g. it was
spectacular /xt wez spekBtækjule/ →/xt wes spekBtækjule/.
3
Assimilations may involve a change in the manner of articulation, e.g. an ideal
form containing a fricative may be replaced by a nasal or a lateral. This is termed
manner assimilation.
Nasal and lateral assimilations occur in English, mainly affecting initial /q/ in
unstressed words, e.g.
join the army
/Bdncxn qi Baimi/
→/Bdncxn ni Baimi/
fail the test
/fexl qe Btest/
→/fexl le Btest/
till they meet again /txl qex miit eBgen/ →/txl lex miit eBgen/
Nasal assimilations are especially common in French, e.g. un demi /) demi/ →
/) nmi/, on demande /* dem&d/ →/* nm&d/.
Co-occurrence of assimilations
Assimilations of different types may occur simultaneously, e.g. behind you /beBhaxndjui/
→/beBhaxndnui/. Here both place and manner assimilation affects /d/ and /j/ of the
ideal form:
/d/ (alveolar plosive)
/j/ (palatal approximant)
/dn/ (palato-alveolar affricate)
More than one phoneme may be affected by an assimilation, e.g. point-blank range
/pcxnt blæfk Brexndn/ →/pcxmp blæfk Brexndn/.

Elision
A change from the ideal form in connected speech may involve the deletion of a phoneme,
e.g. English tasteless /Btexstles/ →/Btexsles/. The phoneme is said to be elided and the
process is termed elision.
Frequently, assimilation processes also involve elision, e.g. English mind-boggling
/Bmaxndbbglxf/ →/Bmaxmbbglxf/.
Historical assimilation and elision
We can distinguish between contemporary assimilation and elision vs. historical 
assimilation and elision processes. In contemporary assimilation/elision (using 
‘contemporary’ in the sense of ‘present-day’), there is an ideal form. The assimila-
tion (or elision) takes place only in a certain phonetic context and, in most cases, 
assimilation or elision is optional. Once the original ideal forms become extinct, and
the assimilated/elided forms are ﬁxed, we term such cases historical assimilation and
elision, e.g. cupboard /Bkwbed/, where the form */Bkwpbcid/ has died out. The ‘silent
letters’ of English spelling provide frequent reminders of historical elision, e.g. talk,
comb, know, could, gnome, whistle, wrong, iron. See Section C5 for a more general 
discussion on language change.
88
Go through two or three pages of one of the extracts in Section D and ﬁnd
more examples of ‘silent letters’ in English.
There is a tendency nowadays for some historical elisions and assimilations to 
revert to the original forms as a result of the inﬂuence of spelling. For instance, in
modern NRP English, /t/ is frequently pronounced in often (formerly /Bbfen/).
89
If you’re a native speaker, how do you pronounce the following words: always,
falcon, historical, hotel, often, perhaps, towards, Wednesday? Do you know 
how your parents say these words? And what about your grandparents (or
people of similar age)? See Section C5. (If you’re not a native speaker, ask an
English-speaking friend.)
Liaison
The converse of elision is liaison, i.e. the insertion of an extra sound in order to facilit-
ate the articulation of a sequence. We have seen (Section B2) that accents of English
can be divided into two groups according to /r/ distribution, namely rhotic accents
where /r/ is pronounced in all contexts, as opposed to non-rhotic accents (like NRP)

124
D E V E L O P M E N T

where /r/ is pronounced only preceding a vowel. In these latter varieties orthographic
r is regularly restored as a link across word boundaries, e.g.
sooner /Bsuine/
sooner or later /Bsuine r ci Blexte/
sure /tci/
sure enough /Btci r xBnwf/
This is termed linking r. With most speakers of non-rhotic English, it is also possible
to hear linking r when there is no r in the spelling. This is termed intrusive r.
the sofa in the catalogue /qe Bsekfe r xn qe Bkætelbg/
my idea of heaven /max axBdxe r ev Bheven/
we saw a ﬁlm /wi Bsci r e Bfxlm/
bourgeois immigrants /bkenwai r Bxmxgrents/
via Australia /vaxe r bBstrexlie/
Intrusive r is heard after the vowels /ai ci e/ and the diphthongs terminating in /e/.
Instances with other vowels hardly ever occur: /™i/ is invariably spelt with r (except
possibly in the word yeah as a form of yes); ﬁnal /$i/ almost always has r in the spelling.
Many native speakers are aware of the existence of intrusive r and many seem to make
a conscious effort to avoid it (especially after /ai/ and /ci/). It is often considered by
English people (particularly the older generation) as ‘lazy’ or ‘uneducated’ speech.
Nevertheless, it is a characteristic feature of NRP, and is also heard from the over-
whelming majority of those who use any non-rhotic variety of English. Some native
speakers will insert a glottal stop in examples like those given above, in a conscious
effort to avoid producing an /r/ link. But, interestingly, many of those who condemn
intrusive r vociferously are unaware of the fact that they regularly use it themselves.
French is notable for an elaborate system of liaison, e.g. Il est assez intelligent, where
‘est’ and ‘assez’, pronounced /e/ and /ase/ in citation form, recover the ﬁnal conso-
nants when they occur pre-vocalically in connected speech: /il ™t as™z %t™lin&/.
Related to liaison is epenthesis, which is the insertion into a word of a segment
which was previously absent. In all varieties of English, including NRP, speakers often
insert a homorganic plosive between a nasal and a fricative in examples such as the
following: once /wwnts/, length /lefk0/, something /Bswmp0xf/. As a result, words like
sense and scents may be pronounced identically as /sents/.
90
Some English native speakers distinguish the following pairs. Others, pro-
nouncing an epenthetic consonant, say them identically: mince – mints;
prince – prints; patience – patients; chance – chants; tense – tents; Samson –
Sampson; Thomson – Thompson. What do you do? Check with friends. Can
you think of any other examples of the same phenomenon?
In some accents of English, particularly Irish English, an epenthetic /e/ is inserted in
sequences such as /lm/ and /rm/, e.g. film /Bfxlem/, alarm /eBlarem/.

Patterns of assimilation in English
General observations
Assimilation and elision tend to be more frequent in:
q
unstressed rather than stressed syllables;
q
rapid rather than slow tempo;
q
informal rather than formal registers.
1 Leading assimilation of place of ﬁnal alveolars
Alveolar →bilabial in context preceding bilabial
/t/ →/p/
5
/d/ →/b/ 6
preceding /p b m/ and less commonly /w/
/n/ →/m/ 7
footpath /Bfkppai0/, madman /Bmæbmen/, pen pal /Bpem pæl/, in March /xm Bmaitt/,
runway /Brwmwex/
Alveolar →velar in context preceding velar
/t/ →/k/ 5
/d/ →/g/ 6
preceding /k g/
/n/ →/f/ 7
gatecrash /Bgexkkræt/, kid-gloves /kxg Bglwvz/, painkiller /Bpexfkxle/
Note that in NRP the allophone of /p k/ representing orthographic t is almost 
invariably strongly pre-glottalised and never has audible release: [mp mk], e.g. footpath
[Bfkmppai0], gatecrash [Bgexmkkræt]. Often there will be complete glottal replace-
ment [Bfkmpai0], [Bgexmkræt].
Alveolar →palato-alveolar in context preceding palato-alveolar
/s/ →/t/
#
preceding /t/
/z/ →/n/ $
spaceship /Bspexttxp/, news sheet /Bnjuin tiit/
Reciprocal assimilation with /j/
The plosives /t d/ merge regularly with you and your in a process of reciprocal assimila-
tion of place and manner. The fricatives /s z/ have similar reciprocal assimilation with
any word-initial /j/:
/t/ + /j/ →/tt/
/d/ + /j/ →/dn/
/s/ + /j/ →/tn/
/z/ + /j/ →/nn/
suit yourself /BsuittciBself/, ﬁnd your umbrella /Bfaxndnci r wmBbrele/
nice yellow shirt /Bnaxt Bnelek Bt$it/, where’s your cup? /Bw™in nci Bkwp/

126
D E V E L O P M E N T
Assimilations of this sort are especially common in tag-questions with you:
You didn’t do the washing, did you? /Bdxdnu/
You should contact the police, shouldn’t you? /Btkd5ttu/
Assimilation is also frequent in the phrase Do you. This is often written d’you in informal
representations of dialogue: D’you come here often? /dnu Bkwm hxe r Bbf5/.
2 Lagging assimilation involving /—/
Initial /q/ in unstressed words may be assimilated following /n l s z/:
on the shelves /bn ne Btelvz/, all the time /cil le Btaxm/, what’s the matter? 
/Bwbts se Bmæte/, how’s the patient? /hakz ze Bpext5t/.
Lagging assimilations are most frequent preceding the. Nevertheless, a difference is still
to be heard (except at very rapid tempo) between the and a as a result of the lengthen-
ing of the preceding segment and possible differences in rhythm. With words other
than the, assimilation of this type is less frequent – though by no means uncommon
– particularly in unstressed contexts.
in this context /xn nxs Bkbntekst/, when they arrive /wen nex eBraxv/, will they remem-
ber? /Bwxl lex reBmembe/, was there any reason for it? /wez z™i r Beni Briiz5 fci r xt/.
3 Energy assimilation
In English, energy assimilation is rare in stressed syllables. Two obligatory assimila-
tions are used to and have to (where equivalent to ‘must’), e.g.
I used to play cricket /ax Bjuiste Bplex Bkrxkxt/, cf. I used two (main verb) /ax Bjuizd Btui/
I have to write him a letter /ax Bhæfte Braxt xm e Blete/, cf. I have two (main verb 
‘possess’) /ax Bhæv Btui/
There are also some word-internal energy assimilations, generally with free variation
between two possible forms:
newspaper /Bnjuispexpe/ or /Bnjuizpexpe/; absurd /epBs$id/, /ebBs$id/ or /ebBz$id/;
absolute /Bæpseluit/ or /Bæbseluit/; absorb /ebBzcib/ or /ebBscib/; obsession /epBset5/
or /ebBset5/
Although energy assimilations across word boundaries are rare in stressed syl-
lables, they do occur in unstressed contexts, but only in the form lenis to fortis. 
This is particularly true of ﬁnal inﬂexional /z/ (derived from the s of plurals, possess-
ives and verb forms), and also with function words such as as and of and auxiliary
verbs:
of course /ef Bkcis/, it was stated /xt wes Bstextxd/, as soon as possible /es Bsuin es
Bpbseb3/, if she chooses to wait /xfti Bttuizxs te Bwext/, my sister’s teacher /max Bsxstes
Btiitte/, the waiter’s forgotten us /qe Bwextes feBgbt5 ws/
Note that fortis to lenis assimilations, e.g. back door */bæg Bdci/, not bad */nbd
Bbæd/) are not found in English. Such assimilations are common in many languages,
e.g. French and Dutch.

Patterns of elision in English
Elision of /t d/ in consonant sequences
Elision of /t/ or /d/ is common if they are central in a sequence of three 
consonants:
past tense /pais Btens/, ruined the market /Bruixn qe Bmaikxt/, left luggage /lef Blwgxdn/,
failed test /fexl Btest/
Elisions such as these may remove the /t d/ marker of past tense in verbs but the 
tense is usually (not always) clear through context. Elision of /t d/ is not heard before
/h/: smoked herring /Bsmekkt Bherxf/. If /nt/ or /lt/ are followed by a consonant, 
there is normally no elision of /t/ (except at very rapid tempo), though /t/ will be 
glottally reinforced [mt] or replaced by [m]. Note that the vowel before /nt/ and /lt/ 
is shortened: spent time /Bspent Btaxm/ [Bspenmt Btaxm] or [Bspenm Btaxm]; Walt Disney
/wcilt Bdxzni/ [wclmt Bdxzni] or [wclm Bdxzni]. Sequences of consonant
+ /t + j/ and 
consonant + /d + j/ generally retain /t/ and /d/, but often have reciprocal assimilation
to /tt/ and /dn/:
I’ve booked your ﬂight /axv Bbkkttci Bﬂaxt/, I told your husband /ax Btekldnci Bhwzbend/
The verb forms wouldn’t you, didn’t you, etc. are regularly heard with this assimilated
form: /Bwkd5ttu, Bdxd5ttu/ (see pp. 125–6).
The sequence /skt/ has elision of /k/ instead of, or if preceding consonants, in
addition to /t/:
masked gunman /maist Bgwnmen/ or /Bmais Bgwnmen/, they asked us /qex Baist es/
Other notable elisions
The following are examples of connected speech forms not covered by what has been
stated already:
1
/h/ is regularly elided from the weak forms of function words (see also Section A3),
e.g. I think he will have told her /ax B0xfk i wxl ev Btekld e/. This is to be heard even
in formal speech registers in all varieties of English. Because of the linguistic 
insecurity attached to h-dropping in England and Wales (see Section C2), it is
not uncommon for children to be, quite wrongly, corrected by parents, teachers
or speech trainers for eliding /h/ in this context.
2
Another notable elision connected with weak forms is the deletion, in informal
registers, of the dental fricative /q/ in them – often condemned as slipshod
speech, this form in fact has a long history going back hundreds of years and is
to be heard in NRP and all other accents of English.
3
Two common words have frequent alternative forms with elision of dental 
fricatives /0 q/: months /mwns/, clothes /klekz/.
4
Forms of numerals, e.g. ﬁfth, twelfth, do not elide /0/ but may instead elide the
preceding consonant: /fx0, twel0/.
5
Elision of /v/ in of is especially common before /q/, e.g. three of the websites 
/B0rii e qe Bwebsaxts/, one of the lads /Bwwn e qe Blædz/. It is also heard at more

128

Activity J
rapid tempo before other consonants: a piece of paper /e Bpiis e Bpexpe/, as a 
matter of fact /ez e Bmætre Bfækt/.
In more rapid speech, /v/ is sometimes elided before /m/ in the verbs give,
have, leave: give me a chance /Bgx mi e Bttains/, do you have my number /dui ju Bhæ
max Bnwmbe/, leave me alone /Blii mi eBlekn/.
6
The sequence /tt/ is normally reduced to /t/ in three common verbal forms, i.e.
ought to, want to, got to: we ought to visit him /Bwi cite Bvxzxt xm/, I want to leave
/ax Bwbnte Bliiv/ (some speakers will further reduce this to /ax Bwbne Bliiv/ in more
rapid speech), they’ve got to go now /qexv Bgbte Bgek nak/.
7
When going to is used as a tense-former, it is typically pronounced /gene/, 
e.g. What’s going to happen /Bwbts gene Bhæpen/. This form (sometimes shown as
‘gonna’ in dialogue) is often criticised by prescriptivists, but is in fact the norm
in colloquial NRP and all other varieties of native-speaker English.

Transcribe phonemically, showing intonation groups and sentence stress, and
using weak and contracted forms wherever possible.

She tried to fancy what the ﬂame of a candle looks like after the candle is
blown out, since she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. 
After a while, ﬁnding that nothing more happened, she decided to go into
the garden at once. But poor Alice! When she got to the door, she dis-
covered that she had forgotten the little golden key, but when she went 
back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it. Alice 
could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb
up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery. When she had tired
herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.
STRESS AND RHYTHM
Introduction
We’re moving on now from dealing with the segments – i.e. the vowel and consonant
sounds – to tackling supra-segmental features, namely stress, rhythm (which we shall
deal with in this section) and intonation (which we’ll come to in Section B7). Unlike
B6

S T R E S S  A N D  R H Y T H M
129
vowels and consonants, which are single speech sounds, supra-segmental features 
normally stretch over more than a single segment – possibly a syllable, a complete
word or phrase, whole sentences, or even more.
We introduced the concept of stress in Section A3 and from then on we’ve been
employing it for our transcriptions – so you should be quite used to the general idea.
But now let’s examine stress more closely so as to discover:
q
what is implied in phonetic terms
q
what role stress has to play in the sound system of English.
Below we shall employ the distinction ﬁrst made in Section A3 between word stress
(stress in the isolated word) and sentence stress (stress in connected speech).
What is stress?
In English, four phonetic variables appear most signiﬁcant as indicators of stress: 
intensity, pitch variation, vowel quality and vowel duration (see Table B6.1).
1
Intensity in physiological terms is the greater breath effort and muscular energy
associated with stressed syllables. It’s closely related to what is perceived by the
listener as loudness.
2
Pitch variation appears to be, as far as English is concerned, the most important
single factor in determining stress. In English, higher pitch tends to be associated
with stronger stress. We shall come back to discuss pitch and intonation in more
detail in Section B7.
3
Vowel quality, i.e. whether a vowel is central or peripheral (see Figure A6.15, 
Section A6), also determines stress. Take the English vowels in the noun 
present /Bprezent/ as opposed to the verb (to) present /preBzent/. The stressed 
syllables contain the peripheral vowel dress /e/, whereas the unstressed syllables 
have a central vowel /e/. (Note that in the ﬁrst word it is possible for the 
vowel in the unstressed syllable to be further reduced to a syllabic consonant 
/5/; in the second word some speakers may use another non-peripheral vowel,
kit.) Diphthongs have a less clearly discernible glide.
Some degree of vowel centralisation in unstressed contexts is a feature of 
many languages; as a result, unstressed vowels sound somewhat ‘fuzzy’ as 
compared with those in stressed syllables, which retain distinct peripheral 
vowels on the edges of the vowel diagram. As you can see from our example 
above, what is unusual about English is that this process generally goes one 
stage further. The peripheral vowel in the unstressed syllable is actually replaced
by another phoneme – most commonly by /e/, sometimes by /x/ or /k/, or even
a syllabic consonant, e.g. attention /eBtent5/, excitable /xkBsaxteb3/. The effect is 
termed vowel reduction and is one of the most characteristic features of the 
English sound system. Neglect of vowel reduction is one of the commonest errors
of non-native learners of English, and results in unstressed syllables having
undue prominence.

Duration of vowels is an important factor in indicating stress. In English, other
things being equal, vowels are shorter in unstressed than in stressed syllables, 
cf. English sarcasm [Bsaikæz4], sarcastic [saBkæistxk], TV [tiBvii].

The strongest stress is primary stress (indicated by 1 in the example); the next level,
secondary stress (indicated by 2) – anything else is treated as unstressed. Primary
stress is normally shown by a vertical mark [B] placed above the line (as we have been
doing throughout this book). Where it’s necessary to show a secondary stress, this is
shown by a vertical mark below the line, thus: [A], e.g. AcateBgorical, AeccenBtricity,
AexplaBnation, BcauliAﬂower, BgoalAkeeper, etc. Note that unstressed syllables are left
unmarked. For most purposes, it is sufﬁcient to show only primary stress, and from
now on we shall normally ignore secondary stresses and also leave them unmarked,
e.g. cateBgorical, Bcauliﬂower, etc.
In certain languages, stress overwhelmingly falls on a syllable in a particular 
position in the word; we shall term this language invariable stress. For example, in
Czech and Slovak, stress is normally on the ﬁrst syllable; in Italian, Welsh and Polish,
stress is normally on the penultimate (last but one); other languages, such as Farsi
(spoken in Iran), have word-ﬁnal stress. In certain languages, notably French and many
Indian languages, such as Hindi and Gujarati, native speakers don’t seem to consider
stress to be of signiﬁcance. In French, for example, although in isolated words stress
is invariably on the ﬁnal syllable, things are very different in the ﬂow of speech (see
Section C6).
In English and many other languages (e.g. German, Russian, Danish, Dutch), 
not only can stress occur at any point in the word but, crucially, it is ﬁxed for each
individual word; this we may term lexically designated stress. In such languages, 
stress is furthermore of great importance for the phonetic structure of the word and
cannot as a rule be shifted in connected speech.
Despite the signiﬁcance of stress, it’s curious that few languages show stress 
in orthography (an exception is Spanish where any word which does not conform 
to regular Spanish stress patterns has the stressed syllable indicated by an acute
accent, e.g. teléfono ‘telephone’; see Section C6). In English, although it’s often 
very difﬁcult for a non-native to predict the primary stress from the written form 
of the word, there’s no such help. Nevertheless, native speakers are generally able to
guess the stress of unfamiliar words, and this implies that there is an underlying 
rule system in operation, even though the rules for stress are complex and have
numerous exceptions. In fact, linguists have moved from the view once held, which
claimed that there were few rules for predicting English stress, to a standpoint where
some would say that stress is completely predictable. However, any prescriptive 
rule system which aimed at being even reasonably comprehensive would have to be
tremendously complex.
Some word stress guidelines
From the point of view of non-native learners, it’s probably best to consider English
stress as being in part rule-governed, and only to concern themselves with learning
the most useful and frequent patterns. Together with the guidelines which follow, 
the traditional advice to the non-native English learner of noting and memorising the
stress pattern of words when you ﬁrst meet them must still apply. Nevertheless, it is
possible to note a few useful stress guidelines.

132
D E V E L O P M E N T
Words consisting of two or three syllables
Rough guide: primary stress on ﬁrst syllable, e.g. Bculture, Bhesitant, Bmotivate.
Longer words (four or more syllables)
Rough guide: there is a tendency for the antepenultimate syllable to have primary stress,
i.e. the last but two, e.g. crediBbility, comBmunicate, methodoBlogical, etc.
Preﬁx words
Rough guide: in shorter words beginning with a preﬁx, the primary stress typically 
falls on the syllable following the preﬁx: interBference, inBtend, exBpose, conBnect,
unBveil. Exception: a large number of nouns, e.g. Boutput, Binterlude, Bcongress,
Babsence.
Numerous verbs with preﬁxes are distinguished from nouns by stress. We can
term this switch stress. The noun generally has stress on the preﬁx, while the verb
has stress on the syllable following the preﬁx:
Verb

Certain word endings may act as stress attractors, falling into two groups.
Stress on ending itself
ade (nouns), -ain (verbs), -ee (nouns), -eer, -esque (adjs/nouns), -esce (verbs), -ess
(verbs), -ette (nouns), -ique (nouns/adjs), -oon, -self/-selves, e.g. paBrade, abBstain,
interviewBee, engiBneer, groBtesque, convaBlesce, asBsess, statuBette, criBtique, lamBpoon, herBself,
yourBselves.
Stress on syllable preceding ending
-ative, -itive, -cient, -ciency, -eous, -ety, -ian, -ial, -ic, -ical, -ident, -inal, -ion, -ital,
-itous, -itude, -ity, -ive, -ual, -ular, -uous, -wards /wedz/, e.g. alBternative, Bpositive,
Bancient, deBﬁciency, ouBtrageous, proBpriety, peBdestrian, superBﬁcial, melanBcholic,
Bradical, Baccident, Bcriminal, oBccasion, conBgenital, infeBlicitous, Bmultitude, increBdulity,
aBttentive, perBpetual, Bsecular, conBspicuous, Boutwards. Note that many of these lead to
antepenultimate stressing.
Stress in English compounds
Incorrect stressing of compounds doesn’t normally hinder intelligibility, yet this 
area is a very signiﬁcant source of error – even for advanced non-native learners.
To provide a complete guide is impossible since there are indeed many irregularities.
But knowing a few simple guidelines can make compound stress very much easier 

S T R E S S  A N D  R H Y T H M

for non-natives to learn. Even if you still have to use some guesswork, it allows you
to get things right, perhaps nine times out of ten.
Compounds in English are of two types: those which have their main stress on
the initial element of the compound and those which have the main stress on the 
ﬁnal element.
q
Initial Element Stress (IES) with main stress on the ﬁrst part of the compound,
e.g. Bapple pip, Bofﬁce boy, BRussian class.
q
Final Element Stress (FES) with main stress on the last element of the compound,
e.g. apple Bpie, ofﬁce Bdesk, Russian Bsalad. Note that many books term this ‘double
stress’ or ‘equal stress’.
Stress guidelines for compounds
(1) Word shape
Compounds written as one word nearly always have IES, but those written as two words,
or with a hyphen, can be of either stress type.
(2) The Manufactures Rule (FES)
The most useful guides in terms of allocating stress in compounds are the ‘Manufactures
Rule’ and the ‘Location Rule’.
The Manufactures Rule implies that if the compound includes a material used
in its manufacture (e.g. an apple pie is a pie made of apples), then FES applies, e.g.
apple Bpie, plum Bbrandy, paper Bbag, cotton Bsocks, diamond Bbracelet. Compare non-
manufactured items, which instead take IES, e.g. Bapple-tree, Bpaper clip, Bplum stone,
Bcotton-reel, Bdiamond cutter.
(3) Location Rule (FES)
The Location Rule describes the strong tendency for a compound to take FES if 
location is in some way involved.
(a) FES applies if the ﬁrst element is the name of a country, region or town: e.g. Turkish
deBlight, Russian rouBlette, Burmese Bcat, Scotch Bmist, Lancashire Bhotpot, Bermuda
Bshorts, Brighton Brock, London Bpride.
(b) The vast majority of place-names, geographical features, etc. have FES. This 
category includes:
q
regions, towns, suburbs, districts, natural features, e.g. East BAnglia, New BYork,
Castle BBromwich, Notting BHill, Silicon BValley, Land’s BEnd, Botany BBay.
q
bridges, tunnels, parks, public buildings and sports clubs, e.g. Hyde BPark, (the)
Severn BBridge, Paddington BStation, Carnegie BHall, Manchester UBnited.
q
all street names, except street itself, e.g. Church BRoad, Trafalgar BSquare, Thorner
BPlace, Churchill BWay, Fifth BAvenue. Cf. BChurch Street, TraBfalgar Street, etc.
(c) Parts of a building tend to have FES, e.g. back Bdoor, bedroom Bwindow, garden
Bseat, ofﬁce Bchair. Exceptions: compounds with -room are IES, e.g. Bliving room,
Bdrawing room (but front Broom).

Activity J
134
D E V E L O P M E N T
(d) FES applies where positioning of any sort is involved, e.g. left Bwing, upper Bclass,
bottom Bline, Middle BAges. Time location also tends to FES, e.g. morning Bstar, afternoon
Btea, January Bsales, April Bshowers, summer Bholiday.
93
Think of more examples of the Manufactures Rule and the Location Rule.
Can you think of any counter-examples not already mentioned? In many cases,
you can get help from a pronunciation dictionary, such as the Longman
Pronunciation Dictionary (Wells 2008) or the Cambridge English Pronouncing
Dictionary (Jones 2011).
Further useful guides related to the above
(1) The vast majority of food items have FES, e.g. poached Begg. Note that these are
often covered by either the Manufactures Rule or the Location Rule, e.g. Worcester
Bsauce, Welsh Brabbit, Christmas Bpudding, ﬁsh Bsoup. Exceptions: some items take IES
because they can also be regarded as part of the living plant or animal, e.g. Bchicken
liver, Borange juice, Bvine leaves. Other signiﬁcant exceptions are: -bread, -cake, -paste,
e.g. Bshortbread, BChristmas cake, Bﬁsh paste.
(2) Names of magazines, newspapers, etc. have FES (many involve place or time and
are covered by the Location Rule), e.g. (the) Daily BPost, (the) Western BMail, (the)
Straits BTimes, Vanity BFair, (the) New BStatesman.
Other stress patterns
(3) IES applies to compounds including the names of academic subjects, skills, 
etc, e.g. Btechnical college, BFrench teacher (i.e. a person who teaches French).
(4) Nouns formed from verb + particle take IES, e.g. Bmake-up, Bcome-back, Blook-out,
Bbackdrop. Exceptions are few, but note: lie-Bdown, look-Bround, set-Bto. These patterns
have changed in the recent history of the language. See Section C5.
(5) Nouns ending in -er or -ing + particle take FES, e.g. hanger-Bon, passer-Bby, 
washing-Bup.
(6) Compounds formed from -ing + noun are of two types:
q
IES applies where an activity is aided by the object (i.e. a Bsewing machine helps 
you to sew), e.g. Bsewing machine, Brunning shoes, Bscrubbing brush, Bwashing
machine.
q
FES applies where a compound suggests a characteristic of the object, with no 
idea of aiding an activity, e.g. leading Barticle, running Bwater, casting Bvote, sliding
Bscale.

Sentence stress
When discussing transcription (Section A3) we noted that many of the potential stresses
of word stress are lost in connected speech (i.e. sentence stress). The general pattern is
that words which are likely to lose stress completely are those which convey relatively
little information. These are the words important for the structure of the sentence,
i.e. the function words (articles, auxiliary verbs, verb be, prepositions, pronouns, 
conjunctions). The content words (nouns, main verbs, adjectives, most adverbs), which
carry a high information load, are normally stressed.
I’ve Bheard that BJack and BJane Bspent their Bholidays in JaBmaica.

C

(C = content word, F = function word)
There are certain exceptions to the general pattern stated above:
1
Two sets of function words frequently receive stress:
(a) wh-words where these form questions, e.g. where, why, how;
(b) demonstratives, e.g. this, that, these, those.
These particular function words often add signiﬁcant information; the demon-
stratives also provide contrast.
2
Function words normally receive stress when they indicate a contrast:
I said give Bher a kiss, not Bhim.
3
Prepositions are frequently stressed where a contrast is stated or implied:
Would you call yourself a jazz lover?
Actually, I know very little aBbout jazz. I prefer classical music.
It is noteworthy that repeated lexical items are not generally stressed:
There have been Btrafﬁc jams in BDagenham and Bareas Bclose to Dagenham.
A similar effect can be heard in items which are direct equivalents:
Are you Bfond of Bchocolate then?
BGiven the Bchance, I’ll Beat Btons of the stuff.
4
At more rapid tempo, the number of unstressed syllables will increase, and more
lexical words will be unstressed:
I’ve heard that BJack and BJane spent their Bholidays in JaBmaica.
Stress and rhythm
Sentence stress is the basis of rhythm in English. Stressed syllables tend to occur at
roughly equal intervals of time. This is because the unstressed syllables in between
give the impression of being compressed if there are many and expanded if there 
are few.

Notice how the stressed syllables give the impression of coming at regular intervals;
if you pronounce the words in a regular ‘singsong’ manner, it’s possible to tap out
the rhythm with a pencil. Try doing so. We term this effect stress-timing, and it’s
characteristic of languages such as English, Dutch, German, Danish, Russian, and 
many others.
Related to this feature is the variable length of vowels in polysyllabic words. Look
at the following example, and notice how the syllables compress as more are added.

One area in which stress timing reveals itself in English is the way it forms the basis
of rhythm in verse – the metre, to use the technical term. To analyse English poetry
written in the traditional manner, you note the beats on stressed syllables – and this
applies whether we’re dealing with Shakespeare or a nursery rhyme. In the verses below,
the strong beats are shown in bold. There’s always room for variation when reciting

poetry, but the rendering below would be a typical way of reading these lines from 
a nursery rhyme and a piece of comic verse.
For the most part, the stresses fall on the content words, whereas the function
words usually lack stressing. In terms of timing, the intervals between the strong beats
of the stresses are roughly equal. See how, where you have a sequence of more than
one weak syllable, as in ‘everywhere that’ and ‘but it’, the weak syllables compress,
taking up much less time. Note also how the rhythm reﬂects the use of weak forms,
as can be seen when the verse is transcribed phonemically.

Other languages work on a different principle, syllable-timing, giving the impres-

from French:

/nvudre d™Bs&dr | o prct™n aBre | si vu Bple |/

Here each syllable appears to have approximately equal time value, except for the 
ﬁnal one of each group, which is extended. Other languages with a tendency to equal
syllable length are: Spanish, Greek, Turkish, Polish, Hindi, Gujarati.
Stress-timing appears to operate for all types of English spoken by native speakers,
possibly with the exception of those strongly inﬂuenced by Creoles, such as the
English of the West Indies. Some types of English employed as a second language 
(e.g. the English used by many Indians and Africans) absorb the syllable-timing of 
the mother tongue of the speakers, but such varieties can be very difﬁcult for others
to understand. As has been shown, stress-timing is achieved mainly by lengthening
certain vowels at the expense of others: vowels tend to be lengthened in stressed 
syllables and shortened in unstressed syllables.

Transcription passage 11
‘Come on, there’s no use crying like that!’ said Alice to herself, rather
sharply. ‘I advise you to leave off this minute!’ She generally gave herself 
very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she
scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remem-
bered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of 
croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond
of pretending to be two people. ‘But it’s no use now,’ thought poor Alice,
‘to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make
one respectable person!’
SPEECH MELODY
Pitch movement
Variation in speech melody is an essential component of normal human speech. 
Indeed, if it’s absent for any reason listeners reject the speech and claim it to be 
literally inhuman (‘robot-like’). This is a major problem which has to be faced by 
a person who has had the larynx removed owing to cancer or some other disease.
Equipment is available which can produce a voicing buzz but this as yet still cannot
mimic realistically the pitch variation of natural speech.
Pitch refers to human perception, i.e. whether one perceives sounds as ‘high’ 
or ‘low’. The most important physical factor in determining pitch is the frequency

(i.e. speed of vibration) of the vocal folds; in general terms, the higher the frequency,
the higher the perceived pitch, and vice versa.
Many students ﬁnd it difﬁcult to judge whether pitch is rising or falling; the 
following simple analogy may help. The engine of a motor car when ‘revving up’ to
start produces a series of rising pitches. When the car is cruising on the open road,
the engine pitch is more or less level. On coming to a halt, the engine stops with a
rapid fall in pitch.
98  Track 28
Imitate the pitches just described, using a prolonged [ai] vowel.
Tone languages
Pitch variation has an important role to play in communication, supplying meaning
additional to that conveyed by the segmental phonemes. We can distinguish two
signiﬁcant ways in which pitch functions, namely (1) (lexical) tone and (2) intonation.
In many languages, it is possible to use pitch differences to distinguish the 
dictionary meaning of words. This function of pitch is known as tone and such 
languages are termed tone languages. Tone languages may make use of different 
numbers of pitch levels. Two levels (high and low) or three (high, mid and low) are
common.
99  Track 29
Try imitating these examples from Ewe, a three-tone language spoken in 
Ghana and Togo. Note the marking system commonly used for such African
languages: (F) indicates high tone, (E) indicates low tone; mid tones are left
unmarked.

Languages like these, which use a tone system of two or three signiﬁcant pitch levels,
are called register tone languages. In the Far East, contour tone languages are more
common. These chieﬂy employ falling and rising pitches; examples are to be found in
the languages of China, including the most widely spoken variety, Mandarin Chinese.

The tones of a tone language may be analysed in a way comparable to the 
segmental phonemes, giving tonemes and allotones.
It is thought that most of the world’s languages employ tone, and certainly, the
vast majority of African, Far Eastern and American Indian languages are tonal. Europe
in fact is rather odd in having few tone languages. Nevertheless, a few do exist: Serbian,
Croatian, Norwegian and Swedish all have a partial tonal element.
Intonation variation
Most European languages do not use pitch to indicate dictionary meaning. For
instance, you can say the English word yes on a number of different pitch patterns:
Yet it continues to mean yes and can’t be made to mean anything else. Moreover, 
we can’t distinguish homophones, such as English hare, hair; French foi, foie, fois ‘faith,
liver, time’; or German Rat, Rad ‘advice, wheel’ by means of pitch. In English (and
the vast majority of European languages), pitch variation is conﬁned to intonation.
Intonation tunes operate over an extent greater than a single word, usually 
over complete clauses or sentences. Intonation is crucial to human communication,
supplying types of meaning additional to what is supplied by the words themselves.
Think how often you hear people come out with statements like: ‘It wasn’t so much
what he said – it was more the way he said it.’
Intonation works differently in different languages. One of the ﬁrst things one
notices about a French person speaking English is that the intonation sounds very charac-
teristically French (and therefore non-English). A classic TV series, The Muppet Show,
revived in a ﬁlm version in 2012, features a comic character, the ‘Swedish cook’, where
the whole joke is based on stereotypical mock-Swedish intonation. Furthermore, each
accent of a language has its own particular intonation. If you are at all familiar with
the British Isles, you’ll probably already be aware that accents such as Welsh English,
Birmingham English, Geordie (north-east) and Irish English all have different and 
easily recognisable types of intonation. Worldwide, we ﬁnd the same thing over and
over again. To give just two examples: many people are aware that the English of the
southern states of the USA differs strikingly from General American in terms of

intonation; less well known perhaps is that in New Zealand English there are distinct
intonation differences between some South Island varieties.
Obviously we can’t deal with all this variation in a single section. Fortunately, there
is no real need to. You already know that there are obvious differences between the
vowels and consonants of different English varieties, and yet there is also great over-
all similarity so that there are normally no problems of intelligibility. In the same way,
although there are notable differences in the detail of different English intonation 
systems, there is enough overall similarity for people to be able to ‘tune in’ to a new
system and recognise many – if not all – of its implications. The tuning-in process 
is sometimes termed ‘normalisation’. We shall concentrate on describing some of the
most important aspects of the intonation of British NRP, and mention other varieties
only in passing (in Sections C1–C4). Note that selected examples (1–30) are provided
on  Track 31 of your audio CD.
The structure of intonation patterns in English
Marking systems for intonation
We employ the following interlinear marking system for intonation. Pitch patterns are
indicated between an upper and lower line corresponding to the highest and lowest
normal pitch range of the voice. (We are ignoring an effect known as declination, i.e. the
tendency for pitch patterns to compress towards the end of each utterance.) Stressed
syllables are shown by lines (
) and unstressed syllables by dots (•). Thicker lines
(
) can be used to show stressed syllables with particular prominence. The interlinear
system is useful because it conveys a fairly clear impression of the rise and fall of pitch.
The complementary in-text marking system is a much more economical means of
notation. In this case, as the name implies, the pitch information is conveyed by little
marks placed within the actual text. By picking out the essential intonation features and
ignoring the rest, the pattern becomes clearer and is easier to write and quicker to read.
He inIsisted on cooking an Eomelette
IWill it be ready by KFriday?
Intonation group division
The basic unit of speech melody is the intonation group, which is a complete pattern
of intonation. As stated in Section A3, intonation group boundaries are indicated by
single bars |; a double bar || can be used to indicate the end of a sentence.
I’d obviously broken my leg ¡ so I needed to see a doctor.¡¡
Intonation groups often correspond to a grammatical clause. However, much 
variation is possible. For instance, a noun phrase may have a complete group to itself.
The longer the noun phrase, the more likely this is to happen.
(1)
This particular part of Pembrokeshire ¡ is at its most beautiful in the spring.¡¡
Or an adverb, or adverbial phrase, may have its own group:
(2)
Regrettably ¡ paedophiles are unlikely ever to reform.¡¡

142
D E V E L O P M E N T
The presence of an intonation group boundary can occasionally be crucial for 
meaning:
(3a) (Do you really want to leave home?)
I don’t know.¡¡
(3b) (Do you really want to leave home?)
I don’t. ¡¡ No. ¡¡
Where an intonation group boundary occurs, it is possible to pause – although
in the ﬂow of speech these pauses are frequently omitted. Intonation group boundaries
are often (but not always) indicated in the writing by punctuation, e.g. full stops, 
commas and dashes.
The nucleus and nucleus location
In any complete intonation group, one strongly stressed syllable, occurring normally
towards the end, will stand out as being strikingly prominent. The syllable concerned
typically has a marked change in pitch, and is somewhat longer and louder than the
rest. Take this example:
Here, the marked pitch fall on /Bmek/, combined with its extra duration and loud-
ness, highlights that syllable and gives the whole word motorbike prominence in the
sentence. We call such a prominent syllable the intonation nucleus, and it is an essen-
tial component of any intonation group. (Be sure not to confuse this use of ‘nucleus’
with the syllable nucleus, the obligatory element in syllable structure; see Section B1.)
From now on, as in the example above, we shall pick out the intonation nucleus in
bold with underlining. Anything occurring after the nucleus follows the pitch pattern
established already by it, i.e. if the nucleus is falling, the subsequent syllables will be
low level; if the nucleus is rising they will continue to rise. This portion of the intona-
tion group is termed the tail.
The nucleus is the last strongly stressed syllable of the intonation group. This is
normally (not always) part of a content word – often the direct object, as in the exam-
ple above. If the nucleus comes earlier in the intonation group, this usually implies a
special focusing effect. The focusing function of nucleus location is examined below
(pp. 145–6).
The pitch pattern carried by the nucleus is termed nuclear tone (not to be confused
with ‘lexical tone’ in the sense of tone languages). Unlike the variables considered so far,
nuclear tone shows considerable differences both between one language and another, and
often between different accents of the same language. Let us consider the possible tones
carried by the nucleus in NRP English, using the monosyllable green as an illustration.
Falls
Falls have been found to be by far the commonest type of nuclear tone. Research 
has shown that falling patterns account for roughly 70 per cent of all types used in
conversation. We symbolise the high fall thus: (E). A high fall is a swoop down from

high to low (you can sometimes hear a tiny rise in pitch at the start before the fall).
A low fall (K) has much less pitch movement.
Any syllables following the nucleus (i.e. the tail) follow the pitch pattern estab-
lished by it. In the case of falls, these syllables are all on a low pitch.

lished by the nucleus.

aKbysmal.
Rises
Rising patterns are much less common than falling ones. The most frequent rise has
a pitch movement from low to mid, and is symbolised thus (J). If there are syllables 
in the tail following the nucleus, the rise in pitch will be spread over all of them, i.e.
following the pitch pattern established by the nucleus. The less common high rise begins
mid and rises to high.

Syllables before the nucleus
The nature of the nucleus is the crucial factor in intonation. But there are often 
syllables which come before the nucleus, and we also have to take some account of
these. Many intonation patterns in English either (1) begin on a fairly high-pitched
syllable or (2) after a very few low-pitched unstressed or weakly stressed syllables 
have a jump up to a high-pitched syllable, as illustrated below. The portion between
the high-pitched syllable (the onset) and the nucleus is called the head. The onset is
marked with a high circle, thus (I).
Like the nucleus, the onset is a strongly stressed and prominent syllable. Unlike the
nucleus, it occurs early on in the intonation group – either as the ﬁrst syllable, or very
soon after. Following the high-pitched onset, any other syllables before the nucleus
usually fall slightly in pitch. Sometimes, but less commonly, the pre-nuclear pitches
are all low-pitched, or may rise slightly from a low pitch. We shall for the most part
ignore these differences, concentrating our attention on the far more important
nuclear pitch pattern.
Functions of intonation in English
Intonation has four important linguistic functions:
(1) Focusing function, by which the speaker focuses on the most signiﬁcant informa-
tion by means of the location of the nucleus. As stated above, the nucleus is typically
at the end of the intonation group. Shift to an earlier syllable is often used to high-
light some information elsewhere in the utterance. This can easily be demonstrated
(nucleus shown underlined in bold).
Sophie adored her gorgeous new motorbike. (Neutral.)
Sophie adored her gorgeous new motorbike. (Not the old one.)
Sophie adored her gorgeous new motorbike. (Not the horrid one.)
Sophie adored her gorgeous new motorbike. (Not anybody else’s motorbike.)
Sophie adored her gorgeous new motorbike. (She didn’t hate it.)
Sophie adored her gorgeous new motorbike. (It was Sophie – not Delia or Nigella.)

Although all the above are possibilities, some are perhaps more likely than
others. Take a number of sentences out of an English novel and try moving
the nucleus around. What sort of words are difﬁcult to focus on in this way?
°Rick boiled a kettle of Kwater.
He °boiled a kettle of Kwater

Nucleus location functions as a focusing device, not only in English but also in
many other languages, e.g. German, Spanish, Italian and many more. However, some
languages make relatively little use of this feature; French regularly has prominence
on the last syllable of the intonation group, and consequently greater use is made of
grammar and vocabulary as a means of focusing.
A similar focusing effect is to be found in the location of the onset syllable. Once
again, this stands out from the other syllables to be found at the beginning of the into-
nation group, and normally serves to focus on what is, for the speaker, the second
most signiﬁcant word in the utterance.
(2) Attitudinal function is what allows speakers constantly to impose an attitude 
on top of the bare semantic content of what is being said. This is one of the most
important functions of intonation and why any written text must be deﬁcient in at
least one respect to the spoken word. When reading out loud, the reader automatic-
ally superimposes a series of attitudes on the author’s words (not always necessarily
those intended by the original writer). This is one of the most important factors in
allowing different interpretations of prose, drama and poetry.
We can only broadly connect attitudes to the nuclear tones since so much depends
on context and on the basic semantic content of the words in the intonation group.
Nevertheless, two tones – fall-rise and rise-fall – seem noticeably attitudinally marked,
i.e. these tones are inherently laden with certain implications:
Fall-rise: doubt, correction, reservation, appealing to the listener to reconsider.
Rise-fall: impressed, arrogant, conﬁdent, self-satisﬁed, mocking, putting down.
It is also possible to make the following broad distinctions:
Two tones – high fall and low rise – can be regarded as neutral.
Two tones – low fall and high rise – have a strengthening function. These tones tend
to reinforce, emphasise or exaggerate a speaker’s basic attitude.
In particular, low falls tend to be associated with boredom, resignation and even
surliness. High rise tends to be associated with excitement and curiosity. Go back and
re-do Activities 101–105 ( Tracks 32–36) and see if you agree with the attitudinal
implications suggested above.
(3) Grammatical function, which permits speakers to distinguish certain syntactic 
relationships, e.g. phrase and clause boundaries, question vs. statement. One occasional
example of the grammatical function of intonation in English is where a grammatical
statement is converted to a question. Compare:
You’re °going to ECanterbury.
You’re °going to JCanterbury?
In some languages (notably French) a rising intonation pattern is probably the
most frequent way of producing questions in colloquial speech (although it is possible
to produce questions by other means):

S P E E C H  M E L O D Y
147
(Falling intonation) Vous allez à Dijon. (‘You’re going to Dijon.’)  Track 37
(Rising intonation) Vous allez à Dijon? (‘Are you going to Dijon?’) 
Perhaps just as common in English is the reverse effect where a grammatical 
question takes on the meaning of an emphatic statement or exclamation. Compare:
(We might be able to go to Brazil.) °Wouldn’t that be exJpensive? (question)
(We might be able to go to Brazil.) °Wouldn’t that be Ewonderful! (emphatic statement)
What might also be considered a further grammatical function of intonation is
illustrated in the section on English tag-questions below.
(4) Discourse function, which covers such diverse matters as the organisation of 
conversation between two or more speakers (e.g. signals for turn-taking), the indica-
tion of speaker/listener relationship (e.g. in relation to power and authority) and 
the indication of new vs. old information. In this context, we can broadly allocate the
nuclear tones to two categories on the basis of whether they are (terminally) falling
or rising:
Falling tones (i.e. high fall, low fall and rise-fall) suggest: (a) ﬁnality, (b) unloading of
information.
Rising tones (i.e. high rise, low rise and fall-rise) indicate: (a) non-ﬁnality, (b) informa-
tion is sought or anticipated, rather than unloaded.
Consequently, we usually ﬁnd that completed statements and commands involve falling
tones, whereas yes–no questions and introductory non-ﬁnal clauses more typically have
rising nuclei, e.g.
Statements:
Fanny °carefully repeated the inEstructions.
Commands:
ETell me about it.
Yes–no questions:
°Will it be ready by JFriday?
Wh-questions:
°What’s the best way to roast a Egoose?
Non-ﬁnal clauses:
Al°though Oliver promised to ∨help ¡ (he let us Edown).
However, these are broad categorisations and there are notable exceptions, often reﬂect-
ing a combination of discourse and attitudinal function.
To take one example, wh-questions (beginning with a wh-word like what, why,
where and also how) may be said with one of two patterns: either with a rising 
pattern, which makes them sound friendly, engaging and leading on to more; or 
with a falling pattern (sounding more neutral, business-like and as if there is a con-
clusive answer to the question). Compare the same set of sentences, ﬁrst with falling
patterns:
°What’s your Ename?
°Where do you Elive?
°What were you thinking of Edoing this evening?
This tends to sound neutral and businesslike. It sounds rather like a policeman inter-
viewing a suspect.

D E V E L O P M E N T
Activity J
And now the same sequence with rising patterns:
°What’s your Jname?
°Where do you Jlive?
°What were you thinking of Jdoing this evening?
This sounds far more friendly, as opposed to interrogation, and could quite easily be
a stage in making a date!
The overall correlation of rises with non-ﬁnality and falls with ﬁnality can be shown
by an intonation pattern often heard in lists, e.g.
We’ve invited JDelia, ¡ JFanny, ¡ JJamie ¡ and °all the Eneighbours.
Below we shall look at different types of utterance – statements, commands, wh-
questions, yes–no questions – and outline which type of intonation pattern tends to
be associated with them.
Statements
Unmarked (default) pattern
Falling tunes are most frequent with statements.
(1)
°Delia’s bought a turkey from some guy in ESwindon.  Track 31
(2)
It’s really °well worth a Evisit.  Track 31
(3)
(When did Keith leave?) A Emonth or so ago.  Track 31
Note that a low fall could also be used in each of these cases. However, the low fall is
cooler and more distant.
(4)
A Kmonth or so ago.  Track 31
107  Track 38
Practise the following sentences with head + high fall. Cue sentence: Why did
old Grigson leave so early?
He °claimed he was Etired. He °wanted to go Ehome. He was as °drunk as a
Eskunk. He had a°nother apEpointment. He °couldn’t stand that awful  Emusic.
Now with head + low fall:
He °claimed he was Ktired. He °wanted to go Khome. He was as °drunk as 
a Kskunk. He had a°nother apKpointment. He °couldn’t stand that awful Kmusic.
Other patterns
If a rising rather than a falling tune is used with a statement (often with no head), 
an element of non-ﬁnality is imposed on the utterance. Sometimes it will imply that
the speaker is questioning a statement:

(5)
It’s °well worth a Jvisit? (Well, I don’t think so.)  Track 31
(6)
°Delia’s bought a turkey from some guy in JSwindon? (How could she be so 
gullible?)  Track 31
Statements said on a fall-rise add reservation, doubt, disagreement. They are 
used as a polite means of contradicting or correcting a speaker:
(7)
(Floyd arrived this morning.) ∨Yesterday. A ∨month ago (all implying disagree-
ment or doubt).  Track 31
(8)
(Did you ﬁnish the report?) I’ve °ﬁnished writing the intro∨duction . . . (implying 
‘but I still need to do the rest’).  Track 31
If the statement consists of several intonation groups, usually only the last will
have a fall (i.e. completed utterance). The remainder will be said on a rise or a fall-rise
(implying non-ﬁnality, ‘more to come’). (See further below on intonation sequences
(non-ﬁnality).)
(9)
If you °want a ∨good job ¡ it’s im°portant to possess Emanagement skills.  Track
31
Commands
Unmarked (default) pattern
Commands are often said with a falling pattern. This is particularly the case if a 
superior is talking to an inferior (e.g. teacher to student, parent to child, boss to 
employee) and if there is no possibility of discussing the issue.
(10) °Shut the Ewindow.  Track 31
(11) °Stack the books on those Eshelves.  Track 31
Other patterns
Commands said on a rising nucleus express a gentler, warmer tone, with a kind of
deference to the other person’s feelings. The discourse effect given is one of non-ﬁnality,
i.e. that something will soon follow:
(12) °Meet us on JThursday. (And then we can sort it out later.)  Track 31
(13) °Don’t Jworry. (It’ll be alright.)  Track 31
Wh-questions
Unmarked (default) pattern
If the utterance is neutral or business-like, the most common pattern for wh-questions
is a fall – often a low fall:
(14) How can we °possibly pay this Kbill?  Track 31
(15) Who on °earth can we ask to Khelp?  Track 31
Other patterns
Wh-questions frequently have rising tunes. As in the case of commands, a rise makes
the utterance friendlier and more intimate. More account is taken of the other person’s
feelings than is the case with a fall:
S P E E C H  M E L O D Y

150
D E V E L O P M E N T
Activity J
(16) °How can I Jhelp you?  Track 31
(17) °When shall we next Jmeet?  Track 31
Yes–no questions
Unmarked (default) pattern
A common pattern for yes–no questions is a rise:
(18) Has °Prue booked her ﬂight to JParis?  Track 31
108  Track 39
Practise the following sentences with low rises. Cue sentence: We saw Jim the
other day.
°Has he Jchanged? °Is he still married to JLisa? °Did he eventually get a new
Jjob? °Had he cut his Jhair? °Has he moved to JDenmark? °Is he still playing
Jfootball?

Intonation group sequences
Up till now we have concentrated mainly on the isolated intonation group. In this unit,
the types of pattern employed in certain intonation group sequences are discussed.
Other patterns
If yes–no questions are said on a falling pattern they give the impression of insistence.
(19) Do we °have any Echoice? (It doesn’t look as if we have.)  Track 31
Summary
Table B7.1 summarises the main patterns found in various types of utterance.

Non-ﬁnality
As has already been stated, rising nuclei (i.e. low rise, high rise, fall-rise) have a 
discourse implication of non-ﬁnality. Consequently, such patterns are often used 
as lead-ins to further information:
(20) Ken was °driving home from Jwork, ¡ when he °suddenly had this great iKdea. 
Track 31
(21) On the ∨other hand ¡ it would be °wrong to conclude that Elizabeth was in any 
Edanger.  Track 31
Lists
As mentioned earlier, lists provide a very clear illustration of the discourse divide 
of ﬁnality vs. non-ﬁnality. Here, one common pattern is for all the items, except the
last, to have a series of low rises. The last is said on a fall.
(22) You can have Jpasta, ¡ Jrice, ¡ boiled poJtatoes ¡ or Echips.  Track 31
(23) (What did Alan buy?) A Jbook, ¡ a Jpen, ¡ and ten Eminidiscs.  Track 31
Parenthetic intonation
Another discourse effect is parenthetic intonation. Certain intonation groups may 
be said on a sustained low pitch, if they contain information which could be regarded
as additional and possibly enclosed in brackets (parentheses). The intonation pattern
frequently used in these cases is a low rise preceded by low-level syllables:
(24) After having °watched the Jplay ¡ something I didn’t do very Jwillingly ¡ I’m con°vinced
of Marguerite’s Etalent.  Track 31
Parenthetic intonation is especially common in more formal registers, e.g. speeches,
lectures, broadcast talks, and in reading aloud.
Tag-questions and tag-type responses
We shall examine this area in somewhat greater detail since it is something peculiar
to English and follows regular patterns. Tag-questions and tag-type responses are 
typical of all varieties of native English, and so the advanced non-native learner needs
at least a passive knowledge of the crucial signiﬁcance of their intonation patterns.
System of tags
Tag-questions are short yes–no-type questions attached to the main statement. They
repeat the information through an appropriate auxiliary verb plus a pronoun, e.g.
Peter’s seen a jaguar, hasn’t he?
No other major language appears to possess corresponding structures. Their equiva-
lents are stylised exclamations, mostly said on a rising tune, e.g.
French n’est ce pas?
Standard German nicht?
Southern German gell?
S P E E C H  M E L O D Y
151

152
D E V E L O P M E N T
Spanish verdad?
Dutch hè? niet?
Danish ikke? vel?
Italian nonèvero? no?
Polish nie? prawda?
These set phrases lack both the syntactic and intonational complexity of the English
tags.
Balanced and unbalanced tags
The typical pattern for a tag-question is that if the main statement is positive, the tag
is negative and vice versa. These we term balanced tags.
Peter’s seen a jaguar ¡ hasn’t he?
(positive)
(negative)
Peter hasn’t seen a jaguar ¡ has he?
(negative)
(positive)
A less common type is the unbalanced tag, i.e. either positive/positive:
Fiona’s offered to pay, ¡ has she?
or, more rarely, negative/negative (often preceded by ‘so’):
So Rick wouldn’t acknowledge his mistake, ¡ wouldn’t he?
Nucleus location in tags
In all tags, the nucleus invariably falls on the verb – never on the pronoun. An intonation
pattern such as the following, with the pronoun as the nucleus, is completely unaccept-
able in English, but is sometimes produced in error by non-native learners:
* °Peter’s seen a Ejaguar, ¡ hasn’t Jhe?
Intonation in tag-questions
Unbalanced tags are typically (not invariably) uttered with rising patterns. Balanced
tags are regularly said on one of two main intonation patterns, giving two different
meanings which can be viewed as an example of the grammatical function of intona-
tion. If the tag rises, as in example (25) below, the implication is that the speaker 
is not really certain of the statement (perhaps 60 per cent). It is, in meaning terms,
equivalent to a true question.
(25) °Peter’s seen a Ejaguar, ¡ Jhasn’t he?  Track 31
If the tag has a fall pattern, as in example (26) below, this indicates a far greater con-
ﬁdence in what the speaker is saying (perhaps 90 per cent). Despite the conventional
question mark, the falling tag is here not so much a true question as a request for
conﬁrmation of the statement.
(26) °Peter’s seen a Ejaguar, ¡ Ehasn’t he?  Track 31

Nicola wouldn’t do that, ¡ Ewould she?
He missed the train, ¡ Jdidn’t he?
We don’t owe them any money, ¡ Jdo we?
Nicola wouldn’t do that, ¡ Jwould she?
Tag-type responses
A very frequent feature of native-speaker conversational English is the occurrence of
brief responses of a similar structure to the tags just discussed, but in this case a posit-
ive sentence requires a positive response and vice versa. These tag-type responses are
of special interest since, because they lack any real semantic content, they allow the
signiﬁcance of intonation to be displayed most clearly.
(27) (Mrs Beeton’s moved to France) JHas she? (Oliver couldn’t have written this book)
JCouldn’t he?  Track 31
(28) (Mrs Beeton’s moved to France) EHas she? (Oliver couldn’t have written this book)
ECouldn’t he?  Track 31
Tag responses with falling nuclei indicate acceptance of what has been said. High falls
give a far more sympathetic acceptance than low falls, which may have undertones of
hostility and lack of interest. Compare the responses in (29) with those of (28):
(29) (Mrs Beeton’s moved to France) KHas she? (Oliver couldn’t have written this book)
KCouldn’t he?  Track 31
The broken tones have an inherent heavily laden attitudinal function. The fall-rise 
is employed to indicate doubt, correction or polite disagreement:
(30) (Mrs Beeton’s moved to France) ∨Has she? (Oliver couldn’t have written this book)
∨Couldn’t he?  Track 31

Try to hear whether the tag-type response in the examples below is on 
(1) high fall, (2) low fall, (3) low rise, (4) fall-rise.

(Mrs Craddock’s a silly old fool.) Is she?
(The neighbours will look after your hamsters.) Will they?

Transcription passage 12
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened
it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words ‘Eat me’ were 
beautifully marked out in currants. ‘Well I’ll eat it,’ said Alice, ‘and if it 
makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller,
I can creep under the door: so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I 
don’t care which happens!’ She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself,
‘Which way?’, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way 
it was growing; and she was quite surprised to ﬁnd that she remained the
same size. To be sure, this is what generally happens when one eats cake; 
but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but weird things
to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the 
common way. So she set to work, and very soon ﬁnished off the cake.

ACCENT VARIATION – GENERAL AMERICAN
Types of variation found in accents
The basic set of NRP reference vowels (p. 16) is not adequate to deal with all the 
features encountered in other English varieties. For this purpose, we’ve used ﬁve addi-
tional keywords: bath, juice, force, north, happy. Our full list of keywords is printed
in Table C1.1.
It has become common practice to classify pronunciation variation between
accents along the following lines (cf. Wells 1982: 72–80).
Systemic variation: where one accent possesses more or fewer phonemes than
another accent in a particular part of the sound system.
q
Northern English lacks the contrast /w – k/ in strut/foot; such varieties have 
no phoneme /w/ as found in other types of English.
q
South Wales English has an additional contrast in goose/juice with an extra
phoneme /xu/ not found in other accents.
q
Scottish, Irish and some General American have an extra /Q – w/ contrast: e.g.
which – witch.
Distributional variation accounts for cases where two accents may have the 
same system but where environments in which a particular phoneme may occur 
differ. Note that distributional variation is not restricted to a particular set of words
but operates ‘across the board’ as an integral part of the phonological system of the
accents concerned. There are (in principle) no exceptions to the rule.
Examples of distributional variation are:
q
In rhotic accents (see Section B2), r is pronounced wherever it occurs in the spelling.
In non-rhotic accents, it is pronounced only before a vowel.
q
In the happy words, e.g. happy, pretty, Julie, committee, etc., Scots, Northern Ireland,
Yorkshire, Lancashire (except Merseyside) and traditional RP select kit; most other
accents (e.g. London, Birmingham, General American, Australian and most NRP)
select fleece.

157
Lexical variation: where the phoneme chosen for a word or a speciﬁc set of 
words is different in one accent as compared with another. This can affect either a
very large group of words (such as our ﬁrst two examples below), or a very small group
(as in our third example).
q
In the bath words, e.g. bath, pass, dance, etc. (see Section B3), northern England
and Midland accents generally select the trap vowel; so do most other varieties
worldwide, e.g. American. Cockney and NRP, however, select the palm vowel.
Australians vary.
q
In words spelt or, most varieties of English select the thought vowel. However,
some accents retain what was formerly a widespread distinction between two groups
known as the force and north words. The force category contains words like
force, store, sport and also hoarse, course spelt with an extra letter. The north 
words include north, cork, absorb, horse. The manner in which these groups are
differentiated varies, but in Scottish English, for example, force words have the
goat vowel while north words have the same vowel as in thought, giving /fors/
and /ncr0/.
q
In parts of Lancashire, words spelt -ook such as book, took, look have the goose
vowel. In other English varieties, goose only occurs in a few examples of this 
type (e.g. snooker, spook). Otherwise foot is found.
There is no easy way of predicting which words will be susceptible to lexical variation.
Furthermore, speech habits may vary within one accent. For example, NRP speakers
vary in their choice of vowel for orthographic o in words such as constable, accomplish.
Most people use the strut vowel, but some choose lot. Note that the distinction
between lexical and distributional variation is not always clear-cut. A good example
of this is the case of yod-dropping in American varieties (see p. 158). Even though 
we have classed this as an example of distributional variation, as it is in principle 
possible to state a clear rule for the occurrence of this feature, there is in fact much
variation on an individual speaker level.
Realisational variation: all variation which is not covered by any of the categories
above will relate to the realisation of phonemes:
q
face and goat are narrow diphthongs or steady-state vowels in Scots, Irish, Welsh
and northern English accents, but wide diphthongs in Cockney, Birmingham,
Australian, New Zealand and most of the accents of the southern USA.
q
Initial /p t k/ are aspirated in most accents (including NRP and General American)
but are unaspirated in Lancashire, South African and most Indian English.
Once again, some realisational variation will occur even within a speciﬁc accent.
Notoriously, even within NRP, glottalisation varies tremendously, as do realisations
of vowels such as goat and goose.
Patterns of realisational variation often affect more than one phoneme in similar
ways, as is the case with both examples above. Such variation frequently shows inter-
esting patterning, for instance in the symmetry of the vowel system, or modiﬁcations
to articulations determined by speciﬁc phonetic contexts which affect a whole range
of consonant or vowel phonemes.

158
E X P L O R A T I O N
In our brief overview of General American (as compared with NRP) below, 
we mention all four types of variation.1 Systemic, distributional and lexical variation
are structurally the most signiﬁcant types, since in their different ways they involve
phonemic change. Realisational variation (the commonest type, but less signiﬁcant
since it involves no phonemic change) is regarded as the default.
British NRP and General American compared
In this and the following sections we are going to discuss some of the important 
varieties of English spoken worldwide. We shall begin with a comparison of the two
major models of English – British NRP and General American. Although we shall be
concentrating here on the differences between these two varieties, in fact they are most
notable for their great similarity. It may be worth emphasising again (see Section A1)
that educated British and American speakers communicate with ease, and rarely experi-
ence any problems in understanding each other’s pronunciation.
Consonants
The consonant system of General American is in essentials the same as that of British
accents and can be represented with the same phonemic symbols. Note, however, the
following differences.
1
GA is rhotic (distributional variation), e.g. worker /Bw$rker/; /r/ often functions
as a syllabic consonant (see Section A2), e.g. /Bw$rk6/.
2
A salient feature of GA and all varieties of American English is t-voicing (an effect
already mentioned brieﬂy on p. 90), shown in transcription by [Ä]. Normally /t/
is realised in intervocalic position as a brief voiced tap when /t/ follows a stressed
vowel, both word-medially and also across word boundaries, e.g. heating, I 
hate it /BhiÄxf, ax BhexÄ xt/. This is also true if /r/ intervenes, e.g. party /BparÄi/, 
and before syllabic /3 6/, e.g. metal /BmeÄ3/, traitor /BtrexiÄ6/. Note that in GA (and
in American English generally), t-voicing typically leads to neutralisation of the
contrast /t – d/, so that heating – heeding and hit it – hid it sound the same. Although
we are dealing here with an allophone of /t/ and not a phoneme, nevertheless,
because of its high frequency in American English, it is normal to show it in 
slant brackets (distributional variation). Medial /nt/ is regularly reduced to /n/,
e.g. winter /Bwxn6/. Word-ﬁnal /t/ often lacks any audible release.
3
A small minority use an extra phoneme /Q/ for words spelt with wh, e.g. whale, wail
/BQexl, wexl/ (systemic variation). In England, /Q/ died out as a common feature of
the language several hundred years ago and its use is often considered an affectation.
4
Most Americans (not all) have yod-dropping following the dental and alveolar
consonants /0 t d s z n l/, e.g. studio /Bstudiok/, nude /nud/, duke /duk/. The mod-
ern NRP alternative /tt dn/ for /tj dj/ (see Section B2) is regarded as substandard
in America. In NRP some words have a less common alternative form without
/j/. In American, this is the normal form (distributional variation).

159
5
Some American speakers have dark l in all contexts, e.g. level [Üevá]. To British
ears the initial [Ü] can sometimes sound similar to /w/, so that life sounds rather
like wife (realisational variation).
Vowels
Compared with the consonants, there is less similarity between the vowel systems 
of GA and NRP. Nevertheless, for the most part we can employ the same symbols. 
For GA varieties, the ‘length mark’ for free vowels has been omitted since American
varieties do not show the close correlation of length with free vowels found in British
NRP. Other important differences are listed below.
1 Since GA (like most American varieties) is rhotic, there are differences in words
spelt with r, where in GA the counterparts of NRP /ai ™i ci $i e xe ke/ take the
form of a vowel followed by /r/: see Table C1.2 (systemic variation). Note that
the vowels have a special quality known as r-colouring (p. 162).
2 The goat vowel is typically more back and rounded; it is represented here by /ok/,
e.g. solo /Bsoklok/. Americans (especially of the younger generation) seem to be
acquiring a more central unrounded beginning [e] similar to its counterpart in
NRP (realisational variation).
3 In GA (and other American varieties), the trap vowel is often closer and lengthened,
sounding rather like [™i], similar in quality to square in NRP (realisational 
variation). Furthermore, trap is used in all bath words (see Section B3), instead
of NRP palm /ai/, e.g. bath /bæ0/, laugh /læf/, chance /ttæns/, ask /æsk/ (lexical 
variation).
4 In American English many foreign names and loanwords spelt with a are said 
with palm /a/ rather than trap /æ/, e.g. pasta /Bpaste/, Maﬁa /Bmaﬁe/, macho
/Bmattok/, Picasso /pxBkasok/ (lexical variation).

5 Before /r/, many Americans (in areas other than the East Coast) make no differ-
ence between words which in NRP have /e/, /æ/, /™i/ (e.g. merry, marry, Mary),
pronouncing all three as /Bmeri/ (distributional variation).
112
Say this sentence: Hairy Harry married merry Mary. Unless you’re American,
you’ll probably have three vowels (in NRP they come in this sequence 
/™i æ æ e ™i/). See if you can ﬁnd some Americans willing to say the same
sentence. Note how many vowels they have in their various idiolects.
6 The strut vowel is generally closer (realisational variation) – more like /e/ than
in NRP. Before /r/, in words where NRP has /w/, American uses /$/, e.g. hurry
/Bh$ri/, courage /Bk$rxdn/ (distributional variation).
7 Americans have no lot vowel, using palm for both NRP lot and palm words,
so bomb and balm both have palm (systemic variation). For a sizeable minority
(for example, most New Yorkers) words equivalent to NRP lot are split into two
different sets – thought or palm – depending largely on the consonant that 
follows (lexical variation, but with strong patterning).
(a) Before /g f s f 0/, the thought vowel /c/ (similar to NRP /ci/) tends to be
used, e.g. log /lcg/, song /scf/, lost /lcst/, coffee /Bkcfi/, moth /mc0/.
(b) Elsewhere, palm /a/ (similar to NRP /ai/) is employed, e.g. top /tap/, job /dnab/,
shock /tak/.
This type of patterning is particularly common in the New York conurba-
tion and other eastern areas, but is also found to a degree elsewhere especially 
in high-frequency items such as dog, wrong, cost, off, etc.
8 Many GA speakers (particularly of the younger generation) also have no contrast
between palm and thought except before /r/. Thus the pairs cot and caught, and
collar and caller, are pronounced identically (all with palm), but a distinction is
maintained between far and four, and between card and cord. This is a trend which
is already established in Canada, and seems to be rapidly taking over in the United
States (distributional variation).
9 Many words ending in -ile have /el/ or /3/ in GA compared with /axl/ in NRP, e.g. 
fertile /Bf$rÄ3/, missile /Bmxs3/. For certain words, alternative pronunciations with 
/axl/ also exist (lexical variation).
10 A number of GA speakers (particularly of the older generation) still maintain the
force–north contrast discussed above (lexical variation).
Stress and stress-related features
There are some signiﬁcant differences between British and American in (1) the allo-
cation of stress, (2) the pronunciation of syllables such as -ary, -ery and -ory.
(1) Words borrowed from French are generally stressed on the ﬁrst syllable in British
English but they often have ﬁnal-syllable stress in American.

The pronunciation of similarly spelt names frequently varies between Britain and the
USA, with a tendency for American versions to reﬂect spelling more closely. Some of
the more familiar examples are the following:

Differences in setting, intonation and rhythm
Setting
One of the most noticeable differences between GA and NRP setting is that American
vowels are inﬂuenced by r-colouring, affecting adjacent consonants as well as vowels.
For example, in partner, not only the vowels are affected but also the /t/ and the /n/. The
body of the tongue is bunched up to a pre-velar position and the root of the tongue is
drawn back in the pharynx. As compared with NRP, American English also appears more
coloured by semi-continuous nasalisation running throughout speech. Many Americans,
particularly of educated varieties, have noticeable creaky voice (see Section A4).

A C C E N T  V A R I A T I O N  –  G E N E R A L  A M E R I C A N
163
Intonation
Much of what has been said about British intonation applies to GA intonation with
this important difference: American intonation tends to have fewer of the rapid pitch
changes characteristic of NRP, and rises and falls are more spread out over the whole
tune. A very typical pattern, for instance, is this sort of rising tune for questions:
Perhaps because of these differences, American English is sometimes claimed to strike
a British ear as ‘monotonous’. On the other hand, British English intonation is said
to sound ‘exaggerated’ or ‘affected’ to Americans.
Rhythm
A second difference concerns rhythm. American English, because of a tendency to
lengthen stressed checked vowels (e.g. trap) and an apparently slower rate of delivery,
is stereotyped by the British as ‘drawled’. British English, because of the general tend-
ency to eliminate weakly stressed vowels, together with an apparently more rapid rate
of delivery, seems to strike many Americans as ‘clipped’.

Description
Our informant, Kathy, is a translator from the American Midwest. General Amer-
ican displays a degree of variation, so many, but not all, of the features described 
above can be identiﬁed in this small sample of Kathy’s speech. Her pronunciation 
is rhotic ( marching, warming, started) with noticeable r-colouring. She has con-
sistent t-voicing ( little, started, getting). There is no h-dropping ( high, holding).
In words like  during, Kathy has yod-dropping. She uses trap in bath words 
( half ). Her thought vowel is open, rather like NRP palm ( also, ball, called).
Kathy doesn’t exhibit all the American features we have mentioned; for instance, 
initial /l/ isn’t noticeably dark, and her trap vowel is more open than average GA.
Kathy (not being an easterner) doesn’t split NRP lot words up into thought and 
palm sets (see above) ( the vowels in dollar and wrong are the same), nor does 
she have any evidence of a force–north split. Like most younger GA speakers, 
she doesn’t contrast words spelt with w and wh ( white, what, which are all said 
as /w/).
ACCENTS OF THE BRITISH ISLES 1: ENGLAND
Introduction
This section discusses the regional accents (concentrating on the largest cities and con-
urbations) of England. The remainder of the British Isles (together with Liverpool,
which is in many ways a special case) is covered in Section C3. The accompanying
audio CD provides samples of the types of speech discussed. The recorded material
for this and the two subsequent sections have all been provided by genuine speakers
of the variety of English concerned (nobody here is ‘putting on an accent’). Further-
more, it’s all from real conversation – not reading or acting.
Salience and stigmatisation
In discussing local accents of a basilectal type, it is useful to introduce two concepts
which are often of signiﬁcance in determining people’s attitudes to the speech con-
cerned. Salience is a term used to pick out a feature which outsiders notice, and may
also be known and remarked upon by local members of the community. Well-known
examples of salient features are:
q
the uvular [y] of traditional Geordie;
q
the ‘lilting’ intonation of Welsh English;
q
rhoticism in the English of the West Country;
q
fronted vowel [ai] in Australian English palm.
Certain salient features may also suffer stigmatisation. A stigmatised accent
characteristic is one which has low status, and accordingly is the subject of social dis-
approval. Such disapproval can range from correction by parents or teachers to the
feature being the butt of humour or ridicule. Given this scenario, the linguistically

upwardly mobile will ensure that their ﬁrst step is to drop any such feature from their
idiolects and substitute an alternative socially approved pronunciation.
Some signiﬁcant features of the selected accents
1 TRAP or PALM vowel in the BATH words (lexical variation)
NRP, Cockney and other south-eastern accents have the palm vowel in a set of words
which have been termed the bath words (most of which are spelt with the letter a
followed by a fricative or nasal, e.g. craft, bath, pass, chance, plant). Here, most other
accents have the trap vowel (see also Sections B3 and C1).
2 Final vowel in happY words (distributional variation)
The happy vowel (see Sections B3 and C1) has fleece in some accents (happy tens-
ing, see p. 72) and kit in others.
3 Vowel /+/ or /./ in the STRUT words (systemic variation)
All northern and some Midland accents in England lack the strut vowel. In these
varieties, strut is replaced by foot in rush, bus, blood, etc. See Sections B1 and C1.
4 FORCE–NORTH (lexical variation)
Certain accents divide words spelt or into two sets: north words (e.g. north, cord,
form, cork) and force words (e.g. force, port, more, four). In Scottish, words in the
north set have the vowel [c] found in thought, while the force words have the
vowel in goat (realised as [o]), i.e. [ncr0] vs. [fors]. (See Section C1.)
5 Narrow or wide diphthongs in the FACE and GOAT words (realisational
variation)
The face and goat vowels can be realised either as narrow diphthongs, possibly 
steady-state vowels, e.g. [ei oi] (as in South Wales English) – or as wide diphthongs,
e.g. [æx æk] (as in Cockney).

E X P L O R A T I O N
6 Rhotic or non-rhotic distribution (distributional variation)
NRP and most English and Welsh varieties are non-rhotic. Scots, Irish, West Country
and parts of Lancashire are rhotic (see Section B2).
7 h-dropping (systemic variation)
Most urban accents in England and Wales have h-dropping, thus potentially levelling
contrasts such as hedge – edge. A totally h-less accent would mean the lack of the /h/
phoneme and hence systemic variation. In reality, because h-dropping is one of the most
frequent and best-known phonetic social markers in English and is severely stigmatised,
virtually all h-droppers strive, with varying degrees of success, to produce /h/ in more
formal situations. Consequently, in the descriptions this is labelled ‘variable h-drop-
ping’ (examples quoted from the CD recording will normally refer to /h/ deletion).
8 Medial /t/ realised as glottal stop [v] (realisational variation)
Many British accents have more extensive glottalisation than that described for NRP
(see Section B2). Most noticeably, these varieties have glottal replacement of medial
/t/, e.g. letter, bottle [Bleme Bbbm3].
Details of individual accents
In the transcripts contained in this and the following section we have followed the
normal practice in linguistic work of removing most punctuation and also capitalisa-
tion at the beginning of sentences. Breaks in the ﬂow of speech corresponding roughly
to intonation group boundaries are shown with a dash. Hesitation markers (‘ums’ and
‘ers’) have been omitted. Sections which are garbled or difﬁcult to interpret are indi-
cated by a question mark in brackets (?). Italics are used (sparingly) to indicate par-
ticularly emphatic speech. In the accent descriptions, slant brackets have been used
where appropriate for individual phonemes, but the transcription of connected speech
has been placed in square brackets. The sign  indicates that a speciﬁc feature is 
exempliﬁed on the audio CD. Brief explanations have been offered in the notes for words
and phrases which might puzzle readers who are non-native English speakers.
Some of the English varieties have nicknames which are in common use, e.g.
Cockney, Geordie, Scouse, Brummie, and we have noted and explained these. The 
location of the sample taken is shown in brackets. Population ﬁgures are approximate
estimates. Names of informants have been changed.

Notes
bloke (colloquial) = man

the nick (general slang) = police station, prison
Description
The traditional word for the broad accent of London is ‘Cockney’. The origins of the
word, which go back at least 700 years, are uncertain; one attractive theory is that it
may come from an old tale of the ignorant city dweller who believed in a ‘cocken ey’,
a cockerel’s egg. A Cockney is allegedly someone born ‘within the sound of Bow Bells’
– that’s to say where you can hear the bells of St Mary-le-Bow church in the East End
of London. That deﬁnition would cut the number of Cockneys down to a few thou-
sand, but ‘Cockney’ is generally used to refer to all London, and to the speech of the
Greater London area, which has a population of nearly seven million. Outer London,
where most people speak with accents similar to London, covers a huge area and takes
in 12 million inhabitants. Our speaker, Steve, is a telephone engineer from Lewisham
in south-east London.
Cockney is non-rhotic with variable h-dropping. Steve, for instance, pronounces
 /h/ in hospital on two occasions but drops /h/ in  hole. Syllable-ﬁnal stop con-
sonants are strongly glottalised. In ﬁnal position, Steve often replaces intervocalic 
/t/ by glottal stop [m] (e.g.  without any, move it over). Post-vocalic /l/ is very dark,
showing l-vocalisation and sounding rather like [k] (e.g.  usual, terminal, wall). Many
speakers replace /0 q/ by /f v/ (termed th-fronting), e.g. three feathers = [Bfrei Bfevez]
(not heard in this sample). Yod-dropping can be heard in  knew.

170
E X P L O R A T I O N
Londoners use virtually the same vowel system as NRP, but the realisations of 
the vowels are very different. The strut vowel is front and open [a] (e.g.  come
Monday). fleece and goose are extended glides [ei eu] (e.g.  needed, move). The
diphthongs face, price and goat (e.g.  straight, like and phone) sound like NRP
diphthongs price, choice and mouth – an effect which is termed diphthong shift.
The Cockney mouth vowel (e.g.  house) is fronted and often raised ([ai] or [™e]),
sounding rather like NRP square. Front checked vowels dress and trap (e.g.  bed,
van, family) tend to be closer. Like NRP, but unlike most other British accents, Cockney
has the palm rather than the trap vowel in the bath words (e.g.  bathroom).
An interesting development has hit inner London in the last ﬁfteen years or so.
As a result of increasing numbers of in-migrants, especially people of Caribbean 
origin, a new type of accent has emerged. This new variety is sometimes popularly
termed ‘Jafaican’ by journalists, and by Londoners themselves, although linguists prefer
to call it ‘Multicultural London English’ (abbreviated to MLE).
The resulting English is like a cross between traditional Cockney and Jamaican
Creole, hence the name Jafaican (‘fake Jamaican’). MLE retains many typical London
consonantal features such as l-vocalisation, glottal reinforcement and replacement, 
and th-fronting. However, the vowel system is much affected by West Indian English.
Perhaps the most spectacular effect is that the diphthong shift (see above) has been
cancelled out and face, price and goat now sound much more like Caribbean English
(see p. 198) than traditional Cockney. So face and goat are now [feis], [goit], while
price also has a long steady-state vowel [prais].
While this type of English seems to have originated in the Afro-Caribbean 
community, its use has now spread to other ethnic groups, such as Bengalis and
Pakistanis, and also to young working-class whites (‘Anglos’). At the moment, it’s essen-
tially associated with youth – it seems rarely to be heard from the over-forties. See 
p. 214 for its likely repercussions for the London English of the future. For more 
information, see Cheshire et al. (2011).

Description
The West Country (in Britain this means only the south-west of England) is often  thought
of as being essentially rural in character, but it also takes in some very large, densely
populated urban areas, such as Bristol–Bath, Plymouth, Bournemouth and Torquay.
West Country accents are spoken by perhaps as many as five million people in total.
As a result of a long seafaring tradition, many of the original English immigrants to
other countries hailed from the south-west so it is thought likely that this English accent
has had considerable inﬂuence on the English speech of America, Canada, the
Caribbean and possibly elsewhere. Our speakers come from Bristol, the largest 
city in the west of England, which with its suburbs has a population of about three-
quarters of a million.
The accent is consistently rhotic ( world, forty, course), with /r/ often realised as
a retroﬂex approximant [;] and with strong vowel colouring (in some ways reminis-
cent of General American). There is variable h-dropping ( high, Mohammedan) and
extensive glottalisation; as in Cockney, /t/ may be replaced by [m] (e.g.  whatever,
second rendering of forty). Joe frequently replaces initial /q/ by /d/ ( this (week),
these (princes)), but this is not true of all Bristolians. Connected speech exhibits a great
deal of consonant assimilation and elision.
strut is close ( countries, much). A number of bath words are said with the trap
vowel. The palm vowel is very front, giving a contrast with trap which is of length
rather than of quality. The starting-point of price is closer ( rise, wives, wireless).
Much of the West Country has many features similar to those just described, but the
city of Bristol is unique in that words ending in orthographic a, ia have a very close
ﬁnal allophone of /e/. This sounds almost like foot [k] and is interpreted by non-
Bristolian ears as a kind of dark l ( Saudi Arabia), giving rise to what has come to
be known as ‘Bristol-l’.

Description
Birmingham is the largest city (one million) in the West Midlands conurbation, which
in total has a population of about two and a half million people. The inhabitants often
call it by the nickname of ‘Brummagem’ – actually derived from an older form of the
name. Consequently, people from Birmingham are called ‘Brummies’, and Midlands
speech is often informally referred to as the ‘Brummie accent’. Our two informants,
Joyce and her mother – ‘Gran’ in the family circle – come from Small Heath, an inner-
city district of Birmingham. The interviewer is also from Birmingham, but has a much
modiﬁed form of the accent.
The accent is non-rhotic ( courting, our Margie) and has variable h-dropping.
Joyce and Gran delete /h/ very consistently ( here, houses). A frequent realisation of
/r/ is a tap [?] ( married, January). Medial (and sometimes ﬁnal) ng has sounded /g/
( anything). Lexical variation is found in bath words, which generally have the trap
vowel ( ask). A lexical variation feature found in almost all Midland and northern
English is that lot rather than strut is used in the common words  one and also none.
The realisation of the front checked vowels kit and dress is closer than in other
varieties. kit in fact sounds as close as fleece in other accents ( sister, Lichﬁeld). The
fleece and goose vowels are both extended glides ( sleep, do). Many dialectologists
have claimed that in this accent there is no strut–foot contrast. In fact, although
these vowels sound very similar (at least to a non-Midlander), a contrast certainly exists.
strut is similar to an unrounded [k] ( study, suffers), whereas foot is closer and
more rounded than in most other types of English ( could). lot is unrounded [a]
and sometimes fronted ( cot, bombing). nurse is close, front and may have a degree
of lip-rounding [øi] ( work, ﬁrm). Like Cockney, Birmingham has diphthong shift
with wide glides in face, goat ( away, days, over). As in Cockney, the price diph-
thong starts further back, sounding like the choice of most varieties ( right, night).
The happy vowel is fleece realised with a wide glide. Broad Birmingham English is

173
notable for extended intonation patterns with frequent sharp falls, sustained low pitches
or rise-falls, and there are plenty of examples of these in the speech of Joyce and Gran.
‘Er’ in our text represents the all-purpose (he, she, it) 3rd person pronoun /$i/
(weak form /e/). Interestingly, this seems to be a relic of what Shakespeare (also a
Midlander!) frequently indicates by ’a or a in the speech of his ‘low’ characters. It occurs
frequently, for instance, in Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2. But it is also to be found in Hamlet
coming from the lips of the Prince of Denmark himself: ‘Now might I doe it, now a
is a-praying’ (Act III, Scene ii, l. 73; Arden Shakespeare, H. Jenkins 1982).

Dave: another instance – I was on a – I was at Romiley – that’s in – near Marple –
and I give the driver the sign – I was going for a Jimmy Riddle – I had all my machine

and I heard the ding ding – I thought – oh it can’t be – and I heard the bus set off

was coming up – so I stopped him – and he gave me a lift – down to Woodley –
and I found out – that it was a bloke who were drunk on the back seat – as always
– wanted to leave the guard so he decided to ring the bell and leave me stood at
Romiley . . . we had another incident – I had a driver called Brian Craven who sud-
denly phoned an inspector up at Stalybridge Garage – to say that he’d lost a guinea
pig – left a guinea pig on the bus on the 330s went from Hyde to Ashton which in
them days you had three corporations – you had Stockport corporation – Ashton
corporation – and you had SHMD – and we said to this driver – this inspector – if
the guinea pig’s not found it’ll die – so he had a look in the lost property ofﬁce –
and he come back – he says – well – he says – there’s no guinea pig here – and
then he asked us – very sarcastically – was it on a blue bus – a red bus – or a green
bus – so he said a red bus – so he put the phone down on us
Notes
incident: the speaker mispronounces this word
Jimmy Riddle: one of many colloquial expressions for urination. This is what is known
in Britain as ‘rhyming slang’ where a rhyme is used for another word – in this case,
piddle, also a slang word meaning urination. Rhyming slang is mostly associated with
Cockney, but is also heard elsewhere.
wee (general colloquial): another word for urination
guard = bus conductor. The word is used in this sense only in this part of the north 
of England.
leave me stood (general non-standard) = leave me standing
them days (general non-standard) = those days
Stockport corporation, Ashton corporation, SHMD: all public transport companies
a red bus: all the various bus companies had their buses painted different colours. Once
the inspector heard it was a red bus, he knew it had nothing to do with his particular
bus company, so he just abruptly stopped speaking and hung up.
Description
The phrase ‘northern accent’ is popularly used for the kind of speech heard over 
a large area of England, more especially in the populous counties of Yorkshire 

174
E X P L O R A T I O N
and Lancashire (not so often for Merseyside or the north-east). Perhaps as many 
as ten million people speak English of this type, making it the second most widely
spoken variety in Britain. This is a region of great contrasts, taking in the huge 
industrial conurbations of Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire (Leeds–Bradford) and
South Yorkshire (Shefﬁeld–Rotherham), but also having large stretches of sparsely pop-
ulated hills and moorland in between, where rural populations maintain distinct forms
of local dialect speech. Our speaker, Dave, is a bus conductor from the Lancashire
town of Dukinﬁeld in Greater Manchester, and there are some features in his speech
which are characteristic of that particular area.
Northern English has variable h-dropping ( having, Hyde). One salient feature
is to replace the deﬁnite article the by /t/, which is often glottalised or elided ( in t’
toilet). /p t k/ tend to have weak aspiration. Note the way Dave says bus with ﬁnal 
/z/ as /bkz/ – a northern pronunciation often found also with the pronoun us /kz/.
There are many noticeable differences in the vowels. price vowels have a very 
narrow glide (or even a steady-state vowel), sounding rather like a long [ai] vowel 
( motorbike, Hyde). The face and goat vowels have little or no glide ( say, days,
bloke). dress is more open ( left, bell) and trap is retracted ( Ashton, back). Systemic
variation is found in the lack of a strut vowel, foot being used where other vari-
eties have strut ( coming, up, bus). The trap vowel is used in most bath words,
e.g.  asked. The happy vowel is clearly kit rather than fleece ( guinea (pig) [Bgxne]).
Southerners often accuse northerners of having ‘ﬂat’ intonation, and certainly Dave
tends to have less variation in the pitch of his voice than is to be found in many of
the other accents on the CD.
There are distinct differences between Lancashire and Yorkshire. Some areas 
of Lancashire (but not normally Yorkshire) have sounded /g/ for medial ng, i.e. 
/fg/, e.g. singer = [Bsxfge]. Moreover, even though this does not emerge in Dave’s 
speech, quite an extensive area of Lancashire adjacent to Manchester (but not the 
city itself) is rhotic. Yorkshire English is notable for frequent lenis to fortis energy
assimilation, e.g. Bradford City [bratfet Bsxte] – which is something a Lancastrian like
Dave wouldn’t say.

Explain the phonetic features and comment on the social judgements contained
in this extract from Stephen Fry’s novel The Stars’ Tennis Balls (2001: 30).
Slowly you have become infected by a northern accent. Not obvious, just a
trace, but to your sensitive, highly attuned ears as glaring as a cleft palate.
You began to pronounce ‘One’ and ‘None’ to rhyme with ‘Shone’ and ‘Gone’
instead of ‘Shun’ and ‘Gun’, you gently sounded the g’s in ‘Ringing’ and
‘Singing’. At school you even rhyme ‘Mud’ with ‘Good’ and ‘Grass’ with ‘Lass’.
Fair enough, you would be beaten up as a southern poof otherwise, but you
have trailed some of that linguistic mud into the house with you.

Description
The most northerly conurbation of England is Tyneside in the north-east, dominated
by the city of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. This region has nearly a million inhabitants of
whom nearly 300,000 live in Newcastle itself. The popularity of the name ‘George’,
locally modiﬁed to ‘Geordie’, is the reason for the nickname applied to both the
Tynesiders and their mode of speech. Our two main speakers are Kathleen, who 
grew up in Blaydon, a suburb to the south-west of the city, and has a conservative
form of speech; her daughter Peggy, being younger, speaks with a more modiﬁed 
form of the accent.
Geordie has considerable phonetic/phonological differences from other England
varieties and is in some ways closer to Scottish accents (see Section C3). It is, for 
instance, the only large conurbation in England (or Wales) where the accent shows
no h-dropping ( home). But, unlike Scots, it is non-rhotic ( other part). Most 
Tyneside speakers reinforce medial /p t k/ with glottal stop, e.g. better, paper [Bb™mta
Bpeimpa], but this isn’t noticeable with our informants; but note Peggy’s glottalised
[mt] in for example  get your tree cut. For both Kathleen and Peggy, /l/ is invariably
clear in all contexts ( still, little). Broader speakers (only of the older generation 
and usually outside Newcastle itself) sometimes realise /r/ as a uvular fricative or 
approximant and Kathleen, but not Peggy, regularly pronounces it in this way (
grain, green, very).
bath words regularly have the trap vowel (e.g.  last). The strut vowel is absent
from the system (p. 167) ( crumbs, run). Both ﬁnal /e/ and the second element of
the centring diphthongs near and cure are very open, e.g. better [Bb™tma], beer [bia],
cure [kjua]. The palm words spelt ar (e.g.  starlings) have a very back vowel. An
extra vowel /ai/ is used for thought words spelt with al, e.g. walk = [waik] so that
talk and yawn contain different vowels /taik – jcin/. In broad accents, nurse and
thought words are merged so that  words is pronounced as [wcidz] and, in some
words, mouth may be replaced by /ui/, e.g. house /huis/ (cf. Scots). price has a nar-
row glide, e.g. Tyneside [Bt™xns™xd]. face and goat are steady-state vowels [ei oi] (
away, snow). Tyneside is renowned for its extended ‘lilting’ intonation with many ﬁnal
rising patterns, and in this respect Kathleen and Peggy are both typical Geordies.

ACCENTS OF THE BRITISH ISLES 2: CELTIC-INFLUENCED
VARIETIES
Introduction
This section deals with the regional varieties of English in the United Kingdom and
the Republic of Ireland which are in some way Celtic-inﬂuenced. There are samples
of Belfast, Dublin, Edinburgh, South Wales and also the English city of Liverpool. The
last-mentioned may seem a bit surprising but Liverpool is actually strongly inﬂuenced
by Irish and North Wales Welsh, as we shall see later (pp. 184–5).

– and everybody had their meals and stuff like that – and – used to try and sort of
facilitate various – pieces of conversation with people – you’re trying – ﬁnd out what
was going on – and and whatever – and I remember we took the dinner trolley in
one day – and – the food was disgusting – there was absolutely no doubt about it
that the food was absolutely disgusting – and this guy started going absolutely bananas
about the food – do you know – you cannot possibly expect me to eat this – this is
absolutely disg[usting] – no – it was an Essex accent he had actually – because I

in the dinner hall – he tried – started sort of chucking stuff around – I was really
frightened – I think – no no what was going on here – eventually I moved out of
this sort of dinner hall place to go and get some sort of help to ﬁnd out what should
happen – ’cos I was just a student – I did not understand any of this – and this guy
chased me out of the dayroom – with – what I thought was a big stick – or – I thought
he’d broken a chair – or something like that – and I thought he was chasing me up

Description
Scottish accents are in many ways the most conservative varieties of English and pre-
serve many features which have been lost elsewhere (see Section C5, pp. 199–203).
Scottish English, spoken by nearly all of Scotland’s ﬁve million population, is very 
different from the English of England. It is a direct descendant of a quite separate 
language called Scots (this is what is found in written form in Robert Burns’s poems
and the dialogue in Walter Scott’s novels). Don’t confuse it with Scots Gaelic /Bgælxk/
– a Celtic language, very similar to Irish, now mostly conﬁned to the islands off the
western coast. But although Scots think of themselves as Celts, there is in fact very 
little inﬂuence from Gaelic on present-day Scottish English. Our speaker, Alison, is 
a nurse from the capital, Edinburgh, which is situated together with Glasgow
(Scotland’s largest city) in the densely populated Central Lowlands area.
Perhaps the most noticeable feature of Scottish English is that it is rhotic ( burst,
dinner hall) and that /r/ is realised with a strong tap ( remember). Scottish is 
h-pronouncing and voiceless /Q/ occurs in words spelt wh (e.g.  what). There is 
systemic variation in the form of an extra consonant phoneme /x/, used for ch in a
small number of speciﬁcally Scottish words, e.g. loch, och! /lcx cx/ (none occurs
in this sample). Plosives /p t k/ are only weakly aspirated and there is considerable
glottalisation of ﬁnal/medial /p t k/, with glottal replacement of /t/ (e.g.  eat this,

A C C E N T S  O F  T H E  B R I T I S H  I S L E S  2 :  C E L T I C - I N F L U E N C E D  V A R I E T I E S
179
started). Like many Scots, Alison has a relatively dark variety of /l/ in all contexts 
(e.g.  absolutely, looked, trolley).
The vowels of Scottish English are quite dissimilar in their patterning from other
kinds of English. Vowel length also operates on very different principles. A major 
systemic variation is the lack of a foot–goose contrast. Words like  wood, took are
pronounced with the goose vowel, exactly the same as  food, moved. Like the 
vowels of northern English and Welsh English, Scottish face and goat are steady-
state vowels and not diphthongs ( dayroom, chased, going). trap is retracted (
sat, absolutely). Alison would appear to lack a consistent contrast between trap and
palm – a characteristic of basilectal Scottish English. Listen to her pronunciation of
the phrase  absolutely bananas.
The lot vowel is very close and similar to thought in England varieties ( Jock,
trolley). In fact, many speakers have no lot/thought contrast and cot – caught are
homophones. On the other hand, the nurse words may be represented by /xr/ as in
sir, /wr/ as in burst, word ( burst), /™r/ as in heard. The kit vowel is very open, sound-
ing rather similar to [e] ( think, big, stick, dinner) and is used instead of fleece
in happy words ( everybody). In broader varieties, the incidence of many vowels 
may be radically different from the norm, e.g. good = kit [gxd]; home = face [hem];
dead = fleece [did]. The force–north distinction can be heard in Alison’s speech
in  story vs. sort. The price and mouth vowels have very close starting-points 
[ex, eu] ( frightened, ﬁne, around). In a few high-frequency words (e.g. round, about,
house, out) the mouth vowel may even be replaced by goose ( ﬁnd out) in more
relaxed styles of speech. Note also the salient feature of cannot, did not as [Bkane Bdxne].
Within the speech of the Scottish lowlands there are interesting ‘east–west 
differences’ as they are known. This is particularly true of intonation; for instance,
Glasgow (in the west) is noteworthy for terminal rising patterns but these are largely
absent from the speech of our Edinburgh (eastern) informant.

Description
Irish English is of two distinct kinds – southern Irish English spoken in most of the
Republic of Ireland, and Northern Irish English which is spoken not only in the British
province of Northern Ireland but also in the adjacent parts of the Irish Republic.
Ireland has its own Celtic language, Irish. Although there are relatively few every-
day users of Irish now left, in 1850 well over a million people had it as their mother
tongue. Consequently, Irish has had an important inﬂuence on much present-day 
Irish English, especially in rural areas. Our sample is from Dublin, which with nearly
a million speakers in the surrounding region is by far the largest Irish urban area. The
speakers, Paul and Sean /tc:n/, are two young men from Sallynoggin, near Dublin.
Dublin has no h-dropping ( her house) and has variable use of /Q/ in wh-words
(listen to Paul’s inconsistent pronunciations of  white). Ireland generally has rhotic
pronunciation, but Dublin is variable, with non-rhoticism being associated with
basilectal varieties; ﬁnal /r/ is sounded by Paul in, for example,  her (house), dark,
but not in  (it’s still) there, ever, never. Non-ﬁnal /r/ is frequently realised as a strong
tap ( Gerry), especially in clusters ( brown), varying with an approximant (in 
realisations of  really). /0 q/ are replaced overwhelmingly by dental [@ {] ( think,
third, fourth, the, that) or affricated [@θ, {q] (cf. Liverpool) and with many speakers
the contrasts /0 – t/ and /q – d/ are lost. This type of effect is termed th-stopping.
Word-ﬁnal /t/ may be realised as a weak dental fricative or approximant (e.g. in 
the frequent repetitions of  that [da0]). Sequences such as /rm/ and /lm/ may be 
produced with /e/-insertion, e.g. arm, ﬁlm = [Barem Bfxlem] (does not occur in this
sample).
The Dublin vowel system lacks the links to Scottish English found in Northern
Ireland (see below), but there is nevertheless much signiﬁcant variation compared 
with most England accents. fleece is used in happy words rather than kit ( holy,
family). face and goat are narrow glides (or steady-state vowels) ( say, holy). The
trap vowel is more open ( black), while nurse is more back, sounding a little 
like NRP thought ( her). The strut vowel is closer and back, similar to foot to
non-Irish ears ( funny). Furthermore, for some speakers, the contrast lot/foot
may also be uncertain with a vowel of an [c] type being employed. Broader speakers

A C C E N T S  O F  T H E  B R I T I S H  I S L E S  2 :  C E L T I C - I N F L U E N C E D  V A R I E T I E S
181
(of the older generation) may replace the vowel in certain ﬂeece words by the face
vowel, e.g. feet, tea = [feit tei] (not to be heard in the present sample). The contrast
choice/price may be absent with both having a vowel similar to [cx] ( tile). goose
is a wide glide ( two). mouth begins fronted [™k] ( about, brown).
Rural Southern Irish English has an extended ‘lilting’ intonation range, and this
is one of the main features of what is sometimes referred to by English people as an
‘Irish brogue’, i.e. a stereotypical Irish accent. Nevertheless, this is not so much a part
of Dublin speech, and Paul and Sean (who both grew up in the Dublin urban area)
lack the Celtic-inﬂuenced intonation of their country cousins.

Description
As a result of massive immigration from Scotland in previous centuries, the accents
of Northern Ireland sound quite different from those of the Irish Republic, being 
similar to Scots in many ways. Many rural accents in Northern Ireland, some of 
which are commonly called ‘Scotch-Irish’, show even more Scottish features. In fact,
overall there is a vast range of variation in Northern Irish speech. Our speaker, Martin,

182
E X P L O R A T I O N
comes from West Belfast and has the speech more typical of the older generation. The
information below applies particularly to Belfast and the surrounding area.
Northern Ireland English has no h-dropping ( houses, hands). Many rural 
speakers have /Q/ in wh words (but this is not true of Martin, or indeed of most 
Belfast speakers,  where). The accent is rhotic ( rivers). Fortis stops are sometimes
glottalised. Older speakers (like Martin) may have dental /t/ before /r/ ( country).
Medial /q/ is either a very weak approximant or may be elided ( altogether). Many
Northern Irish speakers have clear l in all positions ( ﬁelds).
kit is very open and central [™] ( picnicked, built, big, district), and is used instead
of fleece in the happy vowel. dress and trap are also very open, trap in addition being
retracted ( hands). strut is more back (like an unrounded [c] vowel) ( country).
The price vowel has a much closer starting-point [™i] ( kind, life, driving). The mouth
vowel is fronted and lip-rounded [œy] ( houses, now, out). The goose vowel is also
fronted but unrounded ( do). face has a centring diphthong ( dangerous, safe).
Broader varieties have considerable lexical variation in vowels, as compared with most
accents of England, e.g. bag = dress [beg]; doll = thought [dcil]. Northern Irish speech
is notable for its characteristic intonation in which there are more rising than falling
tunes, and Martin is very typical in this respect.

outside school in Welsh – inside school it was all English – but you’d – once we
were in the playground we played in Welsh – but that my sister who is nine years

Owen: oh yes
Gwen: he was the youngest of a family of about six children – all his brothers and 
sisters were Welsh-speaking – but by the time he came along – you see to go to
school – he was English-speaking – he didn’t speak Welsh – that might – but you
know that might be psychological because he was the only one in the family who
was not brought up to speak Welsh
Owen: it probably was a psychological thing – yes it might have been – but what you
say now has amazed us quite often – you’ll get certain members of the family speak-
ing Welsh – and then in a matter of years – it’s lost
Gwen: I only spoke Welsh at home – you know – we weren’t allowed to speak 
English – my father wouldn’t let us – but by the time she came to school – the
school had changed – the classroom had changed – she used to play in English –
all the children were speaking English – you know
Owen: yes, that’s it
Gwen: it was in that short space of time – it’s always amazed me
Interviewer: what do you put this down to
Gwen: well – a lot of it was put down to parents thinking it was posher to speak English
to their children than to speak Welsh – you know – you’d often ﬁnd a father and
mother speaking Welsh to each other – and they’d turn round and speak English to
their children
Owen: that’s true

Description
Wales has a population of three million, most of whom live in the south. Welsh certainly
is the liveliest of the Celtic languages. It was spoken by the majority of Welsh people
until the beginning of the twentieth century and still survives as the everyday language
in many areas – over half a million people claim to speak it. So it is not surprising
that Welsh English often has an echo of the old language about it. There are several
distinct varieties of Welsh English. North Wales English is very different from the accent
of the south; within South Wales, the Cardiff–Newport area is quite unlike the rest.
South Wales English is spoken by about two million people. Our informants 
are of the older generation and are both native Welsh speakers. Gwen is a retired 
teacher from Aberdare in Glamorgan, and Owen is a language researcher from
Carmarthenshire. Having academic backgrounds, they speak a mesolectal type of 
Welsh English.
Broad South Wales accents have h-dropping, but this stigmatised feature is 
not found in the speech of our informants. Welsh English is non-rhotic (except for 
some older-generation native Welsh speakers). /r/ is realised as a tap [?]. Plosives lack
glottalisation. /l/ is clear in all contexts, e.g.  Welsh, children.
Most Welsh English has extra vowel contrasts. The goose vowel splits system-
ically into goose words /ui/ (e.g. goose, blue, mood,  too) and juice /xu/ (e.g. juice,
blew, nude, include,  used). This means that words like through – threw [0rui – 0rxu]
form minimal pairs. As in Scottish English, there is a force–north split /oi – ci/ 
( more vs. short). The strut vowel is often more front, while nurse is sometimes
closer and rounded. trap is retracted ( family) and differentiated from palm
mostly by length ( matter, father [Bmate Bfaiqe]). Many bath words have trap rather
than palm ( classroom). face and goat are usually narrow glides or steady-state
vowels [ei oi]; notice how the vowels in words like  came, amazed and home, spoke
are pronounced by Gwen with hardly any glide. But in face and goat words which
are spelt ai, ay and ow ( played, know) glides are used. price and mouth have cen-
tralised ﬁrst elements [ei, wu] ( writer, allowed).
Gwen’s English has extended ‘lilting’ intonation patterns, reﬂecting those of the
Welsh language with abrupt falls and rise-falls being particularly common; these are
less obvious in Owen’s speech. A salient rhythmic feature is the frequent lengthen-
ing of intervocalic consonants in strongly stressed syllables (e.g.  lot of, posher).

Description
Liverpool is the centre of the Merseyside conurbation (population about one and a
half million) and it has a long history as a major port with a famous seafaring tradi-
tion. It was the popularity of ‘lobscouse’ – a stew made of cheap meat, potatoes and
ship’s biscuit – which gave rise to the inhabitants’ nickname of ‘Scousers’, and led 
to their speech being dubbed ‘Scouse’. Merseyside English sounds strikingly different
from other types of northern English, probably as a result of a massive inﬂux of 
in-migrants over the last three centuries from two Celtic countries – southern Ireland
and neighbouring North Wales. Our speaker, Pete, is a building worker who was asked
to describe a dangerous moment in his life.
Scouse is non-rhotic and has variable h-dropping ( heavy, happens). Like many
Scousers, Pete has virtually no glottalisation, but /p t k/ are heavily aspirated or affricated
( tannery) (possibly an inﬂuence of North Wales Welsh where the same effect is
heard). Medial /f/ is followed by sounded /g/. Typically, /r/ is realised as a strong tap
[?] (found in Welsh and Irish) ( buried). Medial /t/ often shows t-voicing and may
also be realised as a tap [?], e.g.  matter [Bma?e]. Many speakers (including Pete)
frequently exhibit th-stopping replacing /0 q/ by /t d/ ( think, that’s) (this is prob-
ably an Irish inﬂuence, compare Dublin).

W O R L D  A C C E N T  V A R I E T I E S
185
Like other northern England varieties, Scouse has no strut vowel, this being 
replaced by foot ( others, stuff). Furthermore, there is another notable systemic 
variation in that there is no square/nurse contrast ( ﬁrst, there). palm is very fronted
[ai] (no occurrence in sample). bath words have trap ( after). The starting point
of price is retracted ( like).
The intonation of Scouse is characterised by rise-fall intonation patterns.
Liverpool is often noted for its velarised setting (an effect sometimes pejoratively 
called ‘adenoidal’). Despite popular fantasies about this being the result of the damp
climate and adenoidal infections, a more likely source is the similar pharyngealised
setting characteristic of North Wales Welsh.

Description
The English of the southern United States sounds quite different from that of the 
north of the country. Traditionally, the southern states have always been regarded as
the poorer, more backward parts of the USA but they have been catching up rapidly
since the mid-twentieth century. But perhaps because of the long-standing economic
differences, northerners have tended to look down on the accents of the south, and
stereotype them as sounding amusing and uneducated. As a result, some southerners
try to modify their speech and make it sound closer to the language of their northern
neighbours.
Gary is a lawyer with an educated, but quite distinctly Texan, accent. Nacogdoches
/nækeBdekttez/ and Lufkin are two towns, situated about 30 kilometres’ distance from
each other in eastern Texas in the southern USA. As Gary explains, there has always
been a friendly rivalry between the neighbouring communities.

W O R L D  A C C E N T  V A R I E T I E S
187
Unlike General American (GA), some southern USA English is variably non-
rhotic. Notice how Gary deletes /r/ in  horn, years and remember, but pronounces
it in far superior. There is t-voicing ( forty, beat ’em, little). Unlike Kathy (see Section
C1), Gary, a southerner, and from the older generation, uses /Q/ in wh-words
(what’s). A salient feature is the replacement of fricative /z/ by a stop /d/ preced-
ing nasal /n/ in  wasn’t [wad5t].
Much of what we have said about General American also applies to southern USA
English. But southern USA English has several distinctive characteristics – notably in
the vowel system. For instance, the price vowel often lacks any glide, sounding like a
long vowel [ai] ( times, I, library). Another noticeable feature is the phenomenon
called ‘breaking’, which involves inserting [e] between a vowel and the following /r/ or
/l/. Notice, for instance, how the vowels in  square, ball, old become [™ie, cie, eke].
The absence of contracted forms with not is also characteristic of southern speech
( ‘Nacogdoches was not supposed to beat ’em’, ‘that we do not have over here’).
One of the most striking things about southern USA English is its rhythm and
intonation. It is often described as ‘drawling’, implying that it sounds slow and drawn
out to other Americans. Intonation tunes also appear more extended than in GA. Notice
how high-pitched the syllable  Luf- is in ‘but Lufkin has some . . .’, ‘Lufkin has a lot
of industry’).
2 Kentucky  Track 54
Bill: well I’m – right now we’re living in Louisville – Louisville Kentucky, which – we don’t
have accents in Louisville any more but – that – I went – I was raised about two hours
east of here in the – Appalachian Mountains in Irvine Kentucky – which is a town
of thirty-ﬁve hundred – and now if you want to hear accents we just call Jobie – he
lives there in Irvine – and I guess that – you get a sampling of what – what the
dialect would be up that way – but – usually when I call home I really get my old –
accent back in a hurry – and then when I call California I lose it so – but – I’ve been
trying to get Jacob to come up there and spend a couple of days on the farm and
relax a little bit – but – he’s got another two thousand miles to go – here you’re
going to have to go up there – Mike and Barb – Mom’s sister has a – farm up there
– they have like – seven horses – and it’s up in – near Red River Gorge – which is
just one of the prettiest parts of the state – and we go horseback riding up there –
and when you come we’re going to have to hop on one of those things – I guess
you ride horses don’t you – but – it’s beautiful up there and you put – especially
here in two weeks when the leaves will have turned – it’s going to be nice
Description
Bill would also regard himself as a middle-class speaker but is proud of his country
origins. Kentucky is geographically a South Midland state but, at least in its rural 
forms, has many afﬁnities with the south. Nevertheless, one exceptional feature (heard
clearly in Bill’s speech) is consistent rhoticism ( farm, horseback). Final -ing is 
pronounced as /xn/ rather than /xf/ ( riding). The fleece, goose, face and goat
vowels are extended ( leaves, lose, raised, home), whereas the price vowel is steady-
state (cf. Texas) ( dialect, riding, miles). A feature characteristic of many southern
American varieties is the neutralisation of the kit and dress vowels before /n/, kit

188
E X P L O R A T I O N
being used for both ( spend [spxnd]). The ﬁnal syllable in accents shows no vowel
reduction. Bill also has extended intonation patterns similar in some ways to south-
ern varieties ( ‘which is a town of thirty ﬁve hundred’, ‘and spend a couple of days 
on the farm and relax a little bit’).

me to work till eight or nine o’clock – I may sit around for three hours four hours
during the day – sometimes I leave – usually I (?)
Tony: do they pay you on a job basis –
Lorraine: they pay – they pay me for as many hours as I work 
Tony: OK
Lorraine: in the beginning he paid me whether I was working or not – and then as my
relationship got a little better with him – I felt that – not that it really wasn’t fair –
but – I’m using his telephone – like when I call Connecticut I charge that on my own
bill – you know I charge it to my home – but I use his phone for local calls – I use
his photocopy machine – he’s not exactly the best payer but he pays – and he lets
me use his facilities – and so I’m there answering you know his phone and what’s
good is – I may need a week off – or – Monday for example I normally would have
worked but now I made an appointment – and I have an appointment in the after-
noon – so if I had a regular job – I couldn’t work for anyone else – because my
schedule wouldn’t allow it – I miss having a steady pay check every week – I miss
that ’cos at least – whether it’s two hundred or it’s eight hundred dollars it’s steady
and you know what you have coming in – so I miss that – I don’t like all the book-
keeping I have to do now – I hate doing billing – I don’t like doing that stuff – no –
I just went for another freelance job – right over here – they make machinery that
folds – things – or packages – products – like if you buy a new shirt – it’s folded
into that plastic bag – it’s the ugliest piece of equipment – they have the ugliest
work – so no matter what you do – it’s nicer than what they had before and they
like it . . .
Description
Even though it may no longer be the biggest city in the world, New York is still 
enormous. Over eight million people live in the city itself, while the metropolitan 
area has a population of approximately twenty million. New York is famous for its 
cosmopolitan atmosphere, and for being home to a bubbling mixture of races, 
religions and languages. Many New Yorkers don’t even have English as their ﬁrst 
language (Spanish is widely spoken, and you also can hear languages such as Chinese,
Russian, Italian, French and Yiddish, to name just a few, at any street corner).
Nevertheless, the city’s brand of English is famous all over America, and thanks partly
to artists like the Marx Brothers and Woody Allen, and more recently politician Rudy
Giuliani, the New York accent is instantly recognisable (at least in its stereotypical 
form) throughout the USA. For whatever reason, the accent has a poor image for
Americans, being held in low esteem even by New Yorkers themselves – as is testiﬁed

W O R L D  A C C E N T  V A R I E T I E S
189
by the large number of courses available through the Internet offering New Yorkers
the chance to ‘improve their accent’. Our speaker, Lorraine, is a white university 
graduate, who lives in a suburb on Long Island. She works free-lance for several New
York companies in the ﬁeld of graphic design. While she has a middle-class occupa-
tion and life style, nevertheless she speaks with an unmistakably New York accent,
although lacking some of the now stigmatised basilectal accent features.
Unlike GA and most other American accents, a salient feature of New York English
is its non-rhoticism. This was formerly heard from all social classes, but for a long
time this situation has been changing, and nowadays r-dropping has become a
strongly stigmatised feature. Nevertheless, mainstream New York speech is notable
for variable non-rhoticity, and this is also the source of much linguistic insecurity.
Lorraine is no exception, and is indeed variably non-rhotic; in  here, better, fair,
payer, morning /r/ is deleted, yet it is pronounced in  work, charge, shirt. New York
speech is often mocked for instances of intrusive-r (see p. 124), but Lorraine produces
no examples in this sample. If /r/ is absent, an off-glide is heard with thought, square
and nurse, e.g.  morning [mcenxf],  fair [fee], bird [b$xd]. In fact, many New
Yorkers who are in general non-rhotic seem regularly to use /r/ in nurse words. This
might well have its origins in an attempt to avoid the old-fashioned highly stigmatised
pronunciation [b$xd] (often misrepresented as ‘boid’) which was a feature of pre-1950
New York speech; Groucho Marx made this vowel almost his trademark.
In common with all United States accents, there is no h-dropping ( whole, 
having), and like the vast majority of present-day Americans, Lorraine has no /Q – w/
opposition;  whether and  work both start with /w/. New York /l/ is often very
dark (velarised) even pre-vocalically ( along, lets, don’t like all, ugliest); note that
both the allophones of /l/ in  local sound rather similar.
Like GA, intervocalic /t/ almost invariably has t-voicing ( better, but I, facilities,
matter). New York is notorious for the prevalence of th-stopping. The fricatives /θ q/
tend to be produced as dental stop articulations [@ {], and since the plosives /t d/ may
also be dental stops, this results in confusion of /θ – t, q – d/. Because th-stopping is
heavily stigmatised, most New Yorkers attempt to remove this feature from their speech.
So it is not surprising that Lorraine varies, producing fricatives for the most part, but
showing th-stopping in, for instance,  three, they pay they pay, felt that – not that).
Like the rest of America, New Yorkers use the trap vowel in bath words 
( freelance, asking, answering, afternoon). trap is often very close and a salient basilec-
tal feature is a centring off-glide [™e] or even [xe]. Lorraine’s trap vowel is indeed 
relatively close, but it lacks the stigmatised glide ( freelance, bag, packages). A 
characteristic feature of New York speech is that the thought vowel is used for both
thought (e.g.  morning, four, call) and for most words spelt o preceding /f θ s g f/
(e.g.  off, along). thought is realised much closer than in GA, and can sound rather
similar to the equivalent sound in British NRP. Like trap, it sometimes has a cen-
tring glide [ce]. This means that in basilectal New York accents, words like law, lore
and lost all have the same vowel. The palm vowel ( charge, o’clock, job) is much
more back and often somewhat closer than in GA – similar, in fact, to GA thought
so making New York darn sound like GA dawn. Two well-known salient New York
features which Lorraine regularly produces are a price diphthong with a back start-
ing point ( nine, buy), and mouth with a very fronted starting point ( allow, now).

190
E X P L O R A T I O N
In terms of suprasegmental features, Lorraine has characteristic New York 
intonation. She has a somewhat extended pitch range as compared with GA, with 
numerous rise-falls, and conspicuous rising and high falling tones (a mixture often 
popularly stigmatised as the ‘New York whine’), e.g.  because I didn’t pay enough
all along; work a whole lot harder than I ever did; it’s not unusual for me to work till
eight or nine o’clock. Along with her somewhat velarised voice quality combined with
nasalisation, these features are typical of a New York accent.

Anne: the set-up of the university is very different than what I found here – I mean 
– there’s – all the buildings are in one location – and there’s probably – well at

biking – just anything outdoors – you know you’ll ﬁnd it in my town – it’s very active
– outdoorsy town – yeah
Description
Canada has a population of 29 million people, but a sizeable minority of these are
French speakers while many recent immigrants don’t have English as their mother
tongue. Nevertheless, this still leaves perhaps as many as 18 million English native 
speakers. The overwhelming inﬂuence on Canadian pronunciation (uniquely amongst
the major countries of the former British Empire) is USA English, but Scottish and
Irish inﬂuences are also claimed. In fact, Canadian English, although recognisably a
distinct variety, is much closer to General American than are many regional varieties
of the USA itself. Within Canada, there is considerable variation on the Atlantic seaboard,
notably the ‘Newﬁe’ speech of Newfoundland.
The speaker, Anne, grew up in a rural area (the Ottawa Valley) 200 kilometres
west of Ottawa and was an exchange student in a European university at the time 
of recording. Like most American English, Anne’s Canadian accent is h-pronouncing
( house), rhotic ( river, water, fourth) and has t-voicing ( Ottawa, water,
beautiful). Yod-dropping is variable, but generally less prevalent in Canada than in
the USA; Anne retains /j/ in  student. Her realisation of /l/ tends to be dark in all
contexts ( along).
bath words have the trap vowel ( class). Anne’s front vowels, kit, dress and
trap, are all rather open ( river, residence, Canada). The thought and palm vowels

W O R L D  A C C E N T  V A R I E T I E S
191
are merged, both sounding like palm, e.g.  probably, walk. Possibly the most salient
feature of Canadian English is the centralised [e]-like nature of the starting-points of
the diphthongs price [ex] and mouth [ek] when they precede fortis consonants, e.g.
 right, bike, like, house, out; compare the non-centralised diphthongs in  ﬁve, ﬁnd,
found, town. Note the upspeak terminal rise intonation patterns in  of campus; walk
to class or so; just anything outdoors. See pp. 274–8; also pp. 192, 193 and 208.

– you have two weeks of holidays – but – most exams – you have three weeks of
exams – and then – say two weeks of holidays – but – not many people have 
exams – towards the end of those three weeks – most people will be ﬁnished with
their exams within the ﬁrst – what – at least two weeks – so you’ll have probably
at least three weeks’ holiday – and you can go home as soon as you’ve ﬁnished
your exams – and so – well I – I had over – I had three and a half weeks’ holiday –
this year – that was in the middle and – you really need the break – and we also
have mid-semester holidays – which – this year – in the semester that I had the
ﬁrst semester before I came over here – it wasn’t – it wasn’t in the middle of semester
– it was – I suppose they shouldn’t be really called mid-semester because it was
just a week off – and the week was two weeks before we started swot-vac

swot-vac: Australian informal term for a non-teaching period (vacation) which allows
students to work intensively (colloquial ‘to swot’) for their examinations.
Description
Australia, with a present-day population of over 20 million and growing, appears set
to become one of the chief standard forms of English of the future. Until recently,
most of its population came from the British Isles, with a majority from southern England,
and this is reﬂected in the nature of Australian speech today. Australian is a relatively
young variety of English, and there are as yet no distinct regional accents in Australia;
all over this vast country, people sound surprisingly similar. However, as mentioned
in Section A1, there are distinct social differences. This speaker, Helen, is a university
student, and speaks what would be classiﬁed as ‘General Australian’ English (i.e. 
neither ‘Broad’ nor ‘Cultivated’, see pp. 7–9).
Australian English is non-rhotic ( working, semesters). Broad accents have some
h-dropping, but this is much less common than in England, and there is no trace of
this in Helen’s speech ( holidays, home). Helen has regular medial t-voicing sim-
ilar to that found in much General American ( university, started). Her /l/ is notice-
ably dark. Systemically, the Australian vowel inventory is identical to that of NRP.
Lexical variation is a feature of certain bath words, where the trap vowel rather than

192
E X P L O R A T I O N
palm is often found in words like dance, example, i.e. before nasal plus obstruent 
coda clusters. When preceding fricatives, e.g. path, grasp,  half, palm is much more
frequent. 
In terms of realisational variation, the front vowels dress and trap are close (
semesters, exams). There is diphthong shift with wide glide realisations in face and
goat ( break, go home). The palm vowel ( started) is very fronted [ai] while nurse
is close and fronted, sometimes with rounding [øi] ( work).
Helen’s speech provides some good examples of one very well-known feature 
of Australian English, namely ‘upspeak’ terminal rise intonation (in fact another 
term occasionally used is ‘Australian question intonation’). See pp. 274–8. Note the 
terminal rises in  so you’ll have probably at least three weeks’ holiday – and you 
can go home as soon as you’ve ﬁnished your exams.

Simon: Thursday night we decided to go down to the pub – and that made me feel
quite good because I really wanted to have a beer – and so – we went down there

maybe that something dodgy was going on – because the lights were on and the

walked in the door – we saw that all the cupboards – the food cupboards – were

Description
Most of New Zealand’s four million people speak English as their ﬁrst language – even
though there are still a signiﬁcant number of Maoris who are bilingual. Located 
geographically over two thousand kilometres from Australia, New Zealand neverthe-
less shares many cultural ties with its closest neighbour, so it isn’t surprising that 
we ﬁnd similarities between these two antipodean varieties. Our speaker, Simon, is a

W O R L D  A C C E N T  V A R I E T I E S
193
post-graduate student at Canterbury University in the South Island and speaks an 
educated variety of New Zealand English. His speech, like that of most New Zealanders
(all except those from the extreme southern portion of South Island), is non-rhotic 
( hours, insured).
Although New Zealand English resembles Australian English in many ways, there
are some interesting differences, and the pronunciation of the kit vowel is a sure-ﬁre
way of picking out a New Zealander. kit is noticeably central for Simon as for most
New Zealanders, and is levelled with /e/ ( sick, live). dress and trap are both 
even closer than in Australian English ( desk – sounding very like disk in most other 
varieties – everybody; ﬂat, bad). The square vowel is often very similar to English NRP
near (there are no instances of square on this recording).
Other features are indeed very like Australian. Simon’s nurse vowel is front and
rounded ( Thursday, turned) and palm is extremely front ( cars, guitars). The near
vowel is often disyllabic ( here, beer [hiie biie]). A feature of the consonant system
is a noticeably dark l ( police, feeling). There is frequent medial t-voicing ( inves-
tigator). As with Australian speakers, rising terminal upspeak intonation patterns 
frequently occur ( . . . to carry all the stuff, . . . were all opened). Simon’s mesolectal
variety lacks the extended diphthong shift forms of face and goat found in broader
New Zealand accents.

Description
Some people may still be surprised to hear that mother-tongue English speakers are
very much in the minority in South Africa, numbering no more than about three and
a half million in total. The English of South Africa is much inﬂuenced by Afrikaans
– a language similar to Dutch, with perhaps as many as six million speakers. It has
been said that South African English ranges all the way from broad accents strongly
inﬂuenced by Afrikaans to upper-class speech which sounds very similar to British
traditional RP (Crystal 2010: 40). In the new South Africa many black South Africans
who speak African languages, such as Zulu, Xhosa and Sotho, now speak English as
a second language.
Our speaker, Nicole, is a student who had spent one year at an Afrikaans-
speaking school, but had the rest of her schooling from English-speaking institutions.
Although Nicole’s speech is very recognisably South African, hers is a middle-class
mesolectal variety lacking many of the potentially stigmatised features (such as voiced
/h/ and unaspirated /p t k/).
There is no h-dropping ( high, having) (but broad South African accents have
voiced /h/) and the accent is non-rhotic ( are far more formal). The distribution of
clear vs. dark l is as in NRP and many other varieties, but dark l has a hollow pharyn-
gealised quality ( else, school, people). /t/ is strongly affricated ( wanting, eating,
a lot of ), perhaps a slight over-compensation for the lack of aspiration in much South
African English. Nicole has very little glottalisation ( went to, it was, much).
dress and trap are close ( together, went, black, adapt). In certain words, the
kit vowel is central resembling [e] ( dinner, mince, cf. New Zealand). strut is rel-
atively front ( much, fun). lot is open and unrounded ( wanting, not). The happy
vowel is said with a close short ﬂeece vowel ( really, funny, basically). The palm
vowel is very back (e.g.  far, carnivores). price and mouth have relatively narrow
glides ( time, kinds, rice, ground, south, powder). square is very close ( their). 
The weak form of the is consistently /qe/ whether it occurs before a vowel or a con-
sonant ( the idea, the English, the oven). The palm vowel is used in bath words 
( can’t).

Description
In terms of numbers, Indian English is without doubt a major world variety; estimates
vary, but it could have as many as thirty million speakers. ‘Indian English’ is used loosely
to include the English spoken in all the Southern Asian area, i.e. that part of Asia which
includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The chief languages, including
Hindi, Urdu, Bengali and Punjabi, are all spoken by many millions of people. Because
there are so many different languages all over Southern Asia, English is recognised as
an ofﬁcial medium which all educated people can use. Consequently, in India, as in
all the countries of Southern Asia, English means essentially second-language English.
Our speaker, Rajiv, comes from Delhi and is a Hindi speaker but from his schooldays
onwards has been speaking English on a day-to-day basis.
One of the most striking things about much Indian English, and this is true of
Rajiv’s speech, is that many consonants are retroﬂex (see Section A5); this is true 
of /t d s z l n r/ ( better, hard, pretty). Rajiv regularly has th-stopping whereby 
the dental fricatives /0 q/ are replaced by /t d/ ( think, both, that, they). The con-
sonants /v/ and /w/ are not consistently distinguished ( why, we), or a compromise
(a labio-dental approximant) is used for both. As with most Indians, Rajiv’s English
is rhotic ( hard, partition); initial and medial /r/ are generally strong taps (
reason, rest). /p t k/ are unaspirated ( politics, talk, keep) and /b d g/ are voiced through-
out ( because, guy, big).
Most types of Indian English use the vowels of the local Indian language and these
will sound quite unlike those of native English. Note also that some Indian words are
said differently in English from the way they are pronounced in India itself. For instance,
the name Gandhi has a long palm vowel in Indian languages but a short vowel in
British English.
Indian English is notable for its syllable-timed rhythm, a feature it shares with many
Indian languages ( ‘life itself is pretty hard’). In many Indian languages stress does not
appear to fall on any particular syllable (cf. French, pp. 131, 228), resulting in unexpected
stress patterns in Indian English ( beginning). These effects can cause intelligibility
problems for non-Indians trying to understand these Indian varieties of English.

Description
Singapore is a truly multicultural country. Most of its inhabitants are of Chinese origin,
but a variety of languages are spoken by the two and a half million people crowded
onto this small island. English is only one of four ofﬁcial languages, but it has a special
position since most Singapore children go to English-language schools. They under-
stand English well and speak their own variety – sometimes called ‘Singlish’ – ﬂuently.
Our speaker, Ben, is typical of many educated Singapore people. Although he is ﬂuent
in two types of Chinese, he regularly speaks English both for his work and in con-
versation with his friends. He can move with ease between more formal English for
work to something much closer to Singlish when relaxing with friends.
Ben has no h-dropping ( has to, helicopter) and his speech is non-rhotic (
heard, barbed wire, person). The dental fricative /0/ is variably replaced by /t/ ( through,
throwing). Final dark l is regularly completely vocalised sounding like an [u] vowel
( killed, level). Final stops are typically unreleased. There is extensive glottalisa-
tion, with complete replacement of /t/ even in intervocalic position or before pause
( quite, rate of ). Ben regularly reduces consonant clusters to a single consonant 
( ground, think, jump).
lot is tense ( lots). The happy vowel is said with a short fleece vowel ( actu-
ally, stories, army). thought and palm are also tense and shorter than in other accents
( forced to, before, half ). bath words typically have the palm vowel ( after, half ).
face and goat lack a glide ( rate of, commotion, most).
Ben’s speech is also characterised by patterns of stress and intonation which 
are typical of Singapore English. Many of these are traceable to the inﬂuence of his
Chinese origins. Note the high level tones in  everybody, I’ve seen, but some people,
we do. There is little reduction of unstressed syllables, giving a syllable-timing effect,

Description
Caribbean English in one form or another stretches across a large area of the Atlantic
throughout the West Indies and over Guyana on the mainland of South America. 
There are also sizeable numbers of ﬁrst- and second-generation speakers with some
competence in Caribbean creoles in Britain and the USA.
Our sample comes from one of the smallest speech communities, St Eustatius 
in the Leeward Islands, more commonly known by its nickname of ‘Statia’. Here 
just over 2000 people live on a tiny island which is still a colony of the Netherlands.
Dutch is the ofﬁcial language that everyone learns in school, and many islanders 
also have a knowledge of Spanish. Nevertheless, the main language of daily com-
munication is a variety of English. Because of the ofﬁcial status of Dutch, there is no
continuum from an acrolectal form of English through to a basilectal creole variety
(as is true of Jamaica or Trinidad, for example). Our speaker, a member of the older
generation, Gregory, is retelling stories that he has heard concerning one of the most
notorious of the nineteenth-century slave owners.
Caribbean English divides along rhotic and non-rhotic lines, and Statian English
is of the latter type ( further, there). A salient feature is the simpliﬁcation of con-
sonant clusters, heard throughout this sample, often eliminating the past tense /t d/
or third person /s z/ markers of verbs ( waist, ﬁnish(ed), start(ed)). One common
word with a typical Caribbean pronunciation is  asked [akst]. Unlike Caribbeans
in, for example, Jamaica, Gregory is not a regular h-dropper. The only indication here
of the frequent Caribbean uncertainty concerning the occurrence of this consonant
is the hint of epenthetic /h/ in the emphatic pronunciation of  owner. The realisation
of /w/ is at times a labio-dental approximant ( whip). Th-stopping (replacement of

198
E X P L O R A T I O N
dental fricatives by stops /t d/) is heard throughout the Caribbean, and Gregory is
typical in this respect ( further than).
Like most Caribbean speakers, Gregory has an open trap vowel ( land) – more
like British than American realisations. The palm vowel is very fronted ( start, cigar).
The face and goat vowels are narrow diphthongs or steady-state vowels [ei oi] 
( take, smoke). Final /e/ is open ( owner [oina]). In  forty, thought is open.
The price and mouth vowels consistently have the typical central starting-points of
Caribbean English ( light, round).

exclusively as their mother tongue. Others, like Aminata, although able to speak 
Krio, also speak English as a second language. They can switch easily between Krio
and English, and indeed constantly vary their use of Krio and English according to
the circumstances and the persons with whom they’re conversing.
Aminata has much in her English which is common to many West African 
countries, but some features are peculiar to Sierra Leone. Unlike most West African
varieties, there is variable h-dropping ( he, his). /p k/ are unaspirated and there 
is no devoicing of /l/ following the fortis plosives ( appointment, o’clock, coming). 
The dental fricatives /0 q/ are replaced by stops /t d/, i.e. th-stopping ( three,
thousand, with, there, this). An unusual Sierra Leone feature compared with other 
varieties of African English is that /r/ is uvular ( irritated, dress). The accent is non-
rhotic ( quarter, forty-ﬁve, market).
Aminata’s realisations of vowels are typical of Sierra Leonian English. trap vowel
is open ( mad, back, black) while strut is back ( onions, Dutch, coming). nurse is
a back vowel rather like NRP thought ( person). The happy vowel is said with a short
steady-state fleece vowel ( forty, actually). Syllables which are unstressed in most
other varieties of English are pronounced with a degree of stress and not reduced to
/e x k/ ( market, African, police, woman). The bath words are said with the palm
vowel ( after, past, can’t). fleece and goose are noticeably short ( sleeping, soup).

PRONUNCIATION CHANGE: PAST, PRESENT, FUTURE
Pronunciation change in the past
Speech habits vary not only geographically but also chronologically. Changes take place
not only from one area to another but also from one generation to another. You are
probably aware that you don’t speak in quite the same way as your parents do and
that your grandparents speak or spoke differently again. And you may have noticed
that if you watch old ﬁlms, or see extracts from newsreels on TV, the pronunciation
of, say, ﬁfty or sixty years ago is in many ways different from that used today.
If we move further back in time, then the differences become much more obvious.
When reading Shakespeare (sixteenth century) you have undoubtedly noticed the changes
that have taken place in grammar and vocabulary between his English and ours. But

it is not perhaps as immediately apparent that Elizabethan pronunciation would also
have been quite different from ours. The English of Chaucer’s time (fourteenth cen-
tury) strikes us as being very far removed from modern English, while Old English
(sometimes called Anglo-Saxon), which was spoken in England before the Norman
Conquest in 1066, looks like – and certainly would have sounded like – a totally alien
language, as just a couple of lines (ll. 312–13) from a famous poem, The Battle of Maldon,
will indicate.

(Thought shall be the harder, heart the keener, 
courage the greater, as our might lessens.)
Although, obviously, we can’t dig up our ancestors and get them talking, never-
theless it’s possible to reconstruct their pronunciation from the historical evidence that’s
available. We can do this in a number of ways. For instance, we can derive a great
deal of information from the orthography: the current spelling of knight indicates 
that this word was probably originally pronounced as [kniçt]. In addition, we can 
examine poetry to see how certain words in previous eras rhymed where they don’t
rhyme today (for example, Shakespeare rhymed love and prove while Pope rhymed
tea and obey). In some cases, present-day regional accents still preserve older pro-
nunciation forms which have been lost in the majority of English varieties. And, ﬁnally,
a very important source of information are books written by the phoneticians of pre-
vious eras, who published either works on elocution for native speakers or books to
help non-natives acquire English (one of the earliest and best examples was produced
in 1550 by a Welshman, William Salesbury, in an attempt to persuade the Welsh to
learn English, and the English to learn Welsh). Assembling and analysing information
from these various sources has enabled historical linguists to construct patterns of sound
change and apply these to many areas of pronunciation.
Let’s now have a look at the changes which took place in English over a period
of several centuries from about 1350 to 1750 by examining the reconstructed English
pronunciations of three famous writers – Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare and
Alexander Pope.

Even though the grammar was somewhat different and certain vocabulary items like
eek ‘also’ and holt ‘wood’ may strike us as strange, the Middle English of the fourteenth
century was perfectly recognisable as the forerunner of the language we speak today.
As you can see from the transcription above, the basis of the modern consonant
system was already present in Chaucer’s day. The most noticeable differences were
the existence of the voiceless velar and palatal fricatives [x ç] (spelt gh) in words like
 droghte, nyght and the consistent use of voiceless /Q/ in wh-words (e.g.  whan
or which). In addition, the English language is at this period rhotic. (You’ll ﬁnd all
these features still present today in Scottish English varieties, which are the most con-
servative of modern regional accents. See Section C3.)
The fourteenth-century vowel system, however, would seem less familiar to us.
Shortly after Chaucer’s time, a massive change, known as the Great Vowel Shift, was
to take place in the pronunciation of English vowels. Up till the fourteenth century,
for example, many present-day fleece words (e.g.  sweete) had the vowel [ei], while
goose words (e.g.  roote) were said as [oi]. Modern face words (like  Aprille,
bathed) contained the [ai] vowel; mouth words (e.g.  ﬂour ‘ﬂower’) were pronounced
with [ui]; and price words (e.g.  inspired) with [ii]. All this was to change in the
space of a century or so.

Even though in modern times Elizabethan theatres have been reconstructed with 
close attention to minute detail (the Globe in London is perhaps the most famous
example), few amongst the present-day audience probably ever stopped to consider
how the actors’ words would have sounded in the Elizabethan era. In fact,
Shakespeare’s own pronunciation would have been very different from the English 
of modern actors like Helen Mirren, Judi Dench or Ian McKellen.
The situation changed totally when in 2004 the British linguist David Crystal decided
to mount an experimental production where an entire play would be performed in
Elizabethan English. Using the linguistic techniques we have already referred to 
(p. 200), Crystal reconstructed the original pronunciation (sometimes abbreviated by 
the drama world to OP) of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. This was not the ﬁrst 
endeavour of this sort; for instance, in 1949 the BBC had engaged Daniel Jones to
devise a radio programme with actors performing excerpts from Shakespearean plays
in original pronunciation. But Crystal’s project was far more ambitious than anything
attempted so far and, furthermore, the production was to take place in the authentic
atmosphere of the recreated Globe theatre. It proved to be a great success, attracting
large audiences on three successive evenings. Subsequently, Crystal revealed the back-
ground to it all by setting down his experiences in a book, Pronouncing Shakespeare,
the Globe Experiment (Crystal 2005), in which he describes the origins and develop-
ment of the whole project, as well as explaining the linguistic analysis employed to
reconstruct the pronunciation of the period.
As you can see from our transcription above, Shakespeare’s English, like Chaucer’s,
was rhotic ( ears). By this time, the velar fricative [x] had disappeared from the 
consonant system, although [Q] lived on. With the advent of the Great Vowel Shift,
the vowel system had become much closer to that which we know today. Sixteenth-
century English had a strut–foot contrast (even though strut, as in  come, was
not yet as open as it is now). The pronunciation of goat (e.g. as in  bones) would
be recognisable to the present day, even though the vowel was steady-state and not 
a diphthong. Certain modern face words were now pronounced with an open [™i]
vowel, sounding similar to present-day square. price ( I) and mouth were by now

diphthongs but with central starting-points [e]. There was no separate set of bath
words; all were said with trap (e.g.  after, answer’d).
English pronunciation in the early modern period
Eighteenth-century English: Alexander Pope (1688–1744)  Track 67
True ease in writing comes from art, not chance,

By the eighteenth century the pace of change slowed down somewhat. This was the
result of greater literacy and a new respect for spelling forms. The efforts of lexico-
graphers (culminating in 1755 with Dr Samuel Johnson’s dictionary) had by now ﬁxed
the modern English spelling system with all its shortcomings and inconsistencies.
Pope’s English had both the consonant and the vowel systems much as we have them
today. London speech was by now non-rhotic ( art), and few people bothered to say
/Q/ in wh-words. Final -ing was said as [xn] ( writing) – a feature (sometimes loosely called
g-dropping) still found today in non-standard English worldwide. In educated pro-
nunciation, /h/ was dropped in many words, not just as today in hour and honour, but
also in, for example, hospital, humble, herb (the last word is still h-less in American English).
The modern nurse words spelt er, ear ( learn) at this point contained [æi],
not [$i]. Certain fleece words, e.g.  ease, had the vowel [ei] (as they still do today
in some southern Irish varieties).
Vowels differed from modern English mainly in terms of realisation. Much had
been retained from Shakespeare’s time: face and goat ( those) were still steady-state
vowels, and mouth ( sound) and price ( writing) retained their central starting-
points, but strut ( comes) was now moving towards its modern central open quality.
Perhaps the most signiﬁcant change was taking place with the trap vowel, which was
lengthening before certain consonants. This had already affected trap before /r/ (as
in harsh). The ﬁnal /r/ was then dropped leaving a lengthened vowel [æi] as its only
trace. In many words, a similar change was now taking place before fortis fricatives
/f 0 s/ (e.g. draft, pass, path) and nasal + consonant (e.g.  dance, chant, demand, branch).
During the nineteenth century, the new long front vowel [æi] then retracted to
become the modern back [ai], thus giving rise to the complex vowel distribution in
the bath words in southern British varieties. But this process was not completed in
the Midlands or north of England nor, crucially, in the USA and Canada.
A corresponding effect took place with lot words before fricative consonants, 
where a long vowel similar to present-day thought developed in words like cost, off, 
cloth, giving /kcist cif klci0/. It survives in much American English (see Section C1) 
and was until recently also a feature of traditional RP and certain southern regional 
varieties (notably Cockney). See below for the current situation.

Change in recent times and in progress
Regularly in the newspapers you will come across journalists deploring the changes
taking place in the English language. Or you may ﬁnd members of the public 
complaining in letters to the editor on the lines of: ‘Will the younger generation 
totally destroy our beautiful language? Will it ever stop? Is there anything we can 
do about it?’ The answer in each case is in all probability ‘no’. Even if you wanted 
to, there’s nothing you can do to stop linguistic change; it has always taken place 
and always will. Nevertheless, although linguistic change must, by deﬁnition, alter 
certain aspects of our language, English will survive. One cannot charge the upcom-
ing generation with ill-treating their linguistic inheritance any more than one can 
accuse the people of Pope’s or Shakespeare’s time of destroying the English that 
had gone before them.
To take a more positive attitude, linguistic change is always interesting to explore
– and especially so when it is change in progress happening all around us. So let’s
move on to examine how speech has developed in relatively recent years: changes which
have taken place in your parents’ and grandparents’ lifetimes, and also some changes
which are going on at the very moment.

which demonstrate the irritation of older people with the way the younger
generation speak?

Has virtually abandoned vowels.
Her teachers say she’s over-text,
Which makes her ma and pa perplexed.
Now they ﬁnd their Hayley drops
Her aitches, and her glottal stops
Are so pronounced, she speaks in code –
This makes her Mum and Dad explode.
Although they pay the highest fees
To educate their daughter, she’s
Already fuelled by the hopes
Of a long career in soaps.
When Hayley’s daily on our screens
They’ll know what modern living means:
That kids today must show forbearance
With their over-cautious parents.

Changing consonants
The only systemic change in seven centuries has been the loss of the palatal/velar 
voiceless fricative (see p. 202). In addition, there has been the virtual loss of /Q/ in
most varieties.
Listening to early twentieth-century recordings of British English speakers, one
is struck by the clearer quality of syllable-ﬁnal /l/. Nowadays, l-vocalisation, i.e. a dark
l with a back vowel quality of an [k] type, is especially noticeable following back 
vowels, e.g. in doll [dbk], ball [bcik], etc. Until recently such pronunciations would
have been regarded as ‘Cockney’, and they may indeed have come into late twentieth-
century speech from London English.
The same London inﬂuence may be at work in the spread of glottal stop – a feature
which is often thought of as a ‘slipshod Cockneyism’ that has invaded young people’s
speech in the last few years. In fact, glottalisation in one form or another is something
which has been around in English for a long time. It can be heard in the speech of
George V – born in 1865, and hardly a Cockney!1 The King’s pronunciation provides
evidence that, contrary to what is sometimes believed, glottalisation was actually 
to be found in traditional RP – even though it only occurred in pre-consonantal 
syllable-ﬁnal contexts (and not medially or before dark l). See also Section B2.
T-voicing, giving a rapid tap, with slight voicing carrying on through the 
articulation, is getting very common indeed. In colloquial speech, many speakers 
tap intervocalic /t/, especially across word boundaries (e.g. that I, not a bit, get it) 
and medially in high-frequency words like better, later, little, e.g. but I’d better get it 
a little later [beÄ axd BbeÄe geÄ xt e BlxÄl BlexÄe]. Nevertheless, there is no sign in British
English of the medial /t – d/ contrast being lost in colloquial speech, as is true of 
much General American, e.g. writing – riding.
Even though /Q/ in wh-words has largely disappeared, curiously, /hj/ in words 
like huge, humour, etc. is now universal. Not so long ago, one could still hear 
old-fashioned speakers who would pronounce /juidn Bjuime/, but this had died out
in RP by the 1970s and has no place in modern NRP. It is still, however, to be 
heard from a minority of General American speakers, and is common in South
African English.
Nevertheless, yod-dropping is on the increase. After /l/, as in lute /ljuit/, /j/ has
effectively died out, although it is still shown in some dictionaries. It is rare nowadays
to hear /sjuit Bsjuipe/ for suit, super, etc., and the vast majority pronounce /suit Bsuipe/.
On the other hand, /j/ lives on in assume and presume, where /eBsuim preBzuim/ are
minority variants. Furthermore, there’s no tendency in NRP – or indeed in most British
English – to remove /j/ from duke, tune, news /djuik tjuin njuiz/. Pronunciations such
as /duik tuin nuiz/ (all of which are the majority form in America) are conﬁned to regional
accents, notably some Cockney, East Anglia and parts of the West Country. In fact,
/tj/ and /dj/ are increasingly replaced by /tt/ and /dn/, e.g. tune /Bttuin/, duke /Bdnuik/;
this has been true for many years, but still starts alarm bells ringing for many speakers
of traditional RP.
1 A good example is George V’s speech at the launch of the liner Queen Mary in 1934 (BBC audio
cassette ZCD 593).

Say these words: suitable, supermarket, presume, consume, news, lute, avenue,
revenue, Luke, enthusiastic. Do you pronounce a /j/ before /ui/? See if you can
ﬁnd native English speakers from a variety of areas to ask. Can you discover
any geographic patterning?
Changing vowels
The only systemic change in the NRP vowel system from that of traditional RP is that
/ce/ as in shore – still shown in most pre-1970 dictionaries – has disappeared. This, of
course, does not take account of speakers of varieties which contrast words of the force–
north type, common in Wales, Scotland, Ireland and much of northern England and
the USA. Nor does it include Londoners who contrast paws – pause /ce - ci/. But in NRP,
there is no longer any /ce - ci/ contrast, so that oar/ore – awe are homophones.
One possible systemic change that could take place in the near future is that NRP
English will lose both of its centring diphthongs near and cure. Of these, near /xe/
is the more stable, although it tends nowadays to have a closer starting-point [ie]. Some
younger speakers replace it by a long steady-state vowel of a kit type, e.g. really [Brxili]. 
In mainstream NRP, cure /ke/ is nowadays more and more replaced by /ci/, especially
in high-frequency words like poor, sure, your, etc. In other – potentially two-syllable –
words, e.g. fewer, jewel, a sequence /uie/ is used instead of cure /ke/. This may imply
that many speakers regard these vowels as being sequences of /ii + e/ and /ui + e/.
Traditional RP also had a third centring diphthong in square represented with ee. In
NRP, this is now overwhelmingly a steady-state vowel – something which was ﬁrst noted
in certain contexts well over a hundred years ago.2 We have recognised this develop-
ment by using a steady-state vowel transcription symbol ™£.
119
Say the following words. All traditionally had /ke/. Do you yourself pronounce
/ke/, /uie/ or /ci/? Ask your friends what they say. Can you think of any other
words of this type?
cure, sure, furious, cruel, insure, tourist, endure, reviewer
In terms of lexical variation there has been a change in thought replacing lot
before fricatives in words like cost, off, cloth (see p. 203). This process, which began in

P R O N U N C I A T I O N  C H A N G E :  P A S T ,  P R E S E N T ,  F U T U R E
207
the eighteenth century, seemed to have become almost universal by the early twentieth,
but has now boomeranged. In this context, the thought vowel is retained only by 
a few traditional RP speakers of the 60-plus generation. All other speakers have
reverted to lot. In words such as halt, malt, salt the use of /ci/ is much more prevalent,
but even so is diminishing. Another change is that the foot vowel, formerly used 
in words like room, broom /rkm brkm/, etc. is now generally replaced by goose, i.e.
/ruim bruim/. Curiously, our Estuary speaker (p. 6) retains this archaism.
An example of change involving distributional variation is that in happy words,
the ﬁnal vowel is now ﬂeece – rather than the kit of traditional RP – but most NRP
speakers realise it as a short vowel with a quality between /x/ and /ii/ (see Section B1
on neutralisation). Only regional varieties in Yorkshire, Lancashire, Scotland and
Northern Ireland overwhelmingly keep the kit vowel.
In endings such as -ate, -less, -ness, -ity, the kit vowel has largely been replaced
by /e/. Words such as obstinate, careless, softness, calamity are now overwhelmingly
said as /Bbbstxnet Bk™iles Bsbftnes keBlæmeti/.
A notable realisational change has been that the trap vowel /æ/ is now much more
open (similar to [a]). In traditional RP it sounded a little like present-day square,
something which can be clearly heard in old British newsreels and feature ﬁlms (Celia
Johnson in Brief Encounter is a famous example). A close trap vowel is also found in
most other world varieties (American, Australian, New Zealand and South African;
see Section C4). And a small minority of traditional RP speakers (almost all now 60-
plus – listen to veteran cricket commentator Henry Blofeld) retain the traditional closer
quality of the vowel. Nevertheless, in twenty-ﬁrst-century Britain old-fashioned RP
realisations of trap as [™e ™i] are found comic by the younger generation. (Interestingly,
as early as 1918 the phonetician Daniel Jones warned non-native learners against 
over-close /æ/, and cited possible confusion of ballet dancer and belly dancer.)
The fleece and goose vowels (/ii/ and /ui/) are now typically diphthongal [xi ku]
in all contexts except before fortis consonants. A much commented-on change in the
speech of the younger generation is that the goose vowel /ui/ is becoming front and
losing its rounding. The effect is particularly striking following palatal /j/ and also palato-
alveolar /ttt/, as in few, music, new, Tuesday, shoe, etc., making a young person’s shoe
sound rather like she to older people. The foot vowel /k/ is typically more central 
in NRP, markedly so with many younger speakers. In addition, it often lacks lip-
rounding, especially in common words, e.g. good, put sounding almost like [gxd pxt].
See also Section B3 for more detail on all these changes.
The diphthongs mouth /ak/ and price /ax/ have swapped their traditional RP 
starting-points. They are now either the same or – as with many younger speakers –
/ak/ has a front starting-point while /ax/ starts back. It’s noticeable that members of
the Royal Family are frequently accused of pronouncing house as ‘hice’ and round the
town as ‘rind the tine’.
Of the diphthongs, goat /ek/ has moved from a back vowel [ok] – a quality 
which it still has in much American English – to a central starting-point [ek]. (A 
lot of American English seems to be going the same way.) With many younger NRP
speakers the quality is further fronted to [ek]. This realisation may be confusing to
older speakers, who interpret it as the face vowel, thus understanding younger-
generation road as older-generation raid.

Changing stress and intonation
Intonation
One striking intonation change which has occurred in the last few years is the increase
in what has been dubbed ‘upspeak’ or ‘Australian question intonation’, referring to
terminal rising patterns employed particularly for narrative. Since this is a well-known
feature of Australian English, its popularity in British accents has been put down to the
inﬂuence of Australian ‘soaps’ (see also Bradford 1997, Section D, pp. 274–8). But
it’s worth noting that very similar patterns existed in regional British English (e.g. 
certain West Country and South Wales accents, notably Bristol and Cardiff) long 
before Australian English penetrated the airwaves. Whatever the origins, it is without
doubt the most obvious instance of ongoing change affecting intonation.
Stress
In 1855, the writer Samuel Rogers complained about the way words were changing
their stress patterns. ‘The now fashionable pronunciation of several words is to me 
at least very offensive: CONtemplate is bad enough; but BALcony makes me sick’ 
(quoted in Crystal 1988: 64). The stress patterns indicated seem pretty normal to us in
the twenty-ﬁrst century, but Rogers was regretting the passing of the pronunciations
of his youth /kenBtemplxt bælBkoknx/.
Changes in stress have affected a number of words in the course of the twentieth
century. Examples are:
exquisite, formerly Bexquisite, now instead exBquisite
dispute, formerly diBspute, now also Bdispute
comparable, formerly Bcomparable, now also comBparable
primarily, formerly Bprimarily, now also priBmarily
laboratory, formerly Blaboratory, now instead laBboratory

There is a strong tendency for stress change in longer words (three syllables or
more) to result in stress shifting to the antepenultimate syllable (two from the end).
This will usually also affect the vowels in the word. Primarily shows this tendency.
Other examples of this stress change are:
minuscule, formerly miBnuscule /mxBnwskjuil/, now instead Bminuscule
pejorative, formerly Bpejorative /Bpiidneretxv/, now instead peBjorative
etiquette, formerly etiBquette, now instead Betiquette
marital, formerly maBrital /meBraxt3/, now mostly Bmarital
kilometre, formerly Bkilometre, now also kiBlometre
controversy, formerly Bcontroversy, now also conBtroversy
lamentable, formerly Blamentable, now also laBmentable
formidable, formerly Bformidable, now also forBmidable
Ongoing change is to be observed in many of these items, in some cases with a strong
rearguard action being fought by older-generation speakers against what they con-
sider to be upstart pronunciations – controversy being a notorious example.
121
How would you stress the following words?
controversy, hospitable, contribute, applicable, lamentable
Certain compounds formed from verb plus particle, e.g. make-up, breakdown, 
hold-up, lock-out, have changed their stress pattern. Final element stress has been 
replaced by initial element stress so that what was formerly said as make-Bup is 
now pronounced Bmake-up. This change, which appears to have taken place in the
1920s, is now completely established in the present-day language. It is interesting that 
certain European learners of English (for example, Germans, Dutch and Danes) tend
to retain the outdated stressing – probably because the word was borrowed a long
time ago. It now counts as a non-native learner’s error.
Other inﬂuences
Spelling inﬂuences
A signiﬁcant inﬂuence affecting ongoing pronunciation change is the regularisation
of pronunciation to ﬁt the spelling. A common phenomenon is the restoration of 
former ‘silent letters’, i.e. examples of historical elision, e.g. /t/ in often /Bbf5/, /l/ in
falcon, almond /Bfcik5 Baimend/, or a vowel changing to conform with its typical spelling.
There are many examples, notable ones being:
waistcoat, formerly /Bweskxt/, now instead /wexstkekt/
landscape, formerly /Blænskxp/, now instead /Blændskexp/

210
E X P L O R A T I O N
forehead, formerly /Bfbrxd/, now generally /Bfcihed/
nephew, formerly /Bnevjui/, now generally /Bnefjui/
portrait, formerly /Bpcitrxt/, now generally /Bpcitrext/
retch, formerly /riitt/, now generally /rett/
ate, formerly /et/, now also /ext/
covert, formerly /Bkwvet/, now also /Bkekv$it/
fortune, formerly /Bfcitten/, now also /Bfcittuin Bfcitjuin/
handkerchief, formerly /Bhæfkettxf/, now also /Bhæfkettiif/
often, formerly /Bbfen, Bcifen/ now also /Bbften/
towards, formerly /tcidz/, now also /teBwcidz/
There are signs that more words may nowadays be going the same way. One can-
didate (by the way, do you yourself say /Bkændxdet/ or /Bkændxdext/?) is the word 
says – traditionally /sez/, but people are starting to pronounce /sexz/. Others are 
solve, involve, proven, traditionally /sblv xnBvblv pruiven/ but now sometimes /seklv
xnBveklv Bprekven/.
American inﬂuences
It’s a commonly heard moan from the older generation that American English is 
beginning to overwhelm British English, but it’s actually very difﬁcult to assemble 
any evidence to support this claim with respect to pronunciation. Although indeed
much American vocabulary is streaming into Britain speech, pronunciation seems
remarkably impervious to USA inﬂuences – apart from the mock-American assumed
by the majority of popular vocalists. Curiously, clear-cut examples of straightforward
Americanised pronunciation are in fact very difﬁcult to ﬁnd. An exception is harass
and harassment: formerly pronounced as /Bhæres Bhæresment/, an American-style 
/heBræs heBræsment/ seems now to be taking over.
In other cases where an American pronunciation has gained in popularity, there
has probably also been inﬂuence from the orthographic form. A notable case is ate
(formerly /et/ but increasingly /ext/). Another example is schedule (formerly only 
initial /t/ but now increasingly with /sk/ as with other words beginning with sch, 
such as scheme, school, scholar, schizophrenic).
One further possible American inﬂuence is the pronunciation of certain nouns
containing the preﬁx re-, e.g. research, resource, relapse, where the traditional British
rendering with stress on the second syllable occurs side by side with forms commoner
in American English stressed on the ﬁrst syllable.
Ironically, American English, rather than being the source of new British pro-
nunciations, frequently preserves traditional forms that were formerly common in 
British English but which are now extinct or going out of favour. Examples are stress
on ﬁrst syllable in laboratory and controversy, use of /ax/ rather than /x/ in privacy,

The pronunciation of English place-names is increasingly inﬂuenced by orthography, 
leading to a rendering closer to the spelling taking over from a traditional form.

Examples are: Romford and Margate (formerly /Brwmfed Bmaigxt/, nowadays more 
often /Brbmfed Bmaigext/). Not all names are affected in this way – size matters. Big
towns, like Leicester /Bleste/ and Worcester /Bwkste/, seem more stable – but smaller
towns, suburbs and villages are much more likely to change.

Try to ﬁnd out the traditional and the modern pronunciations of the places
listed below. You can get a lot of help from pronunciation dictionaries. See
if you can transcribe them phonemically.
Chesham, Cirencester, Coventry, Grantham, Lewisham, Pontefract, Todmorden,
Uttoxeter, Walthamstow
Are there any English place-names in an area you know where two pro-
nunciations exist side by side? Is one an old pronunciation and the other 
a replacement closer to the spelling?
For many years now there has been a tendency for foreign words, particularly 
place-names, to trade their traditional English pronunciations for something more 
exotic. Some names have altered totally, as is true of Prague, Marseilles and Lyons
(formerly /prexg maiBsexlz Blaxenz/, now /praig maiBsex Blii'/). Interestingly, the new
forms are also far removed from the original [Bpraha mazs™j lj*]. In other cases, 
an ongoing battle carries on between, for instance, those who say Copenhagen as 
the traditional /kekpenBhexgen/ and those who use the newer form /kekpenBhaigen/
(neither sounds much like Danish København [købenBhaumn]). An interesting oddity
is the holiday resort Ibiza. At one time most British visitors pronounced this /iiBbiitse/.
Nowadays a pronunciation /iiBvii0e/, not too far away from Spanish [iBβi0a], seems
more popular – but it is rivalled by an upstart with a quite different initial vowel 
/axBvii0e/.
123
If you know any English native speakers who are over 50, ask them how 
they would say these place-names and then say them yourself. Are there any
differences in the way you and the older generation pronounce them?

On your audio CD you’ll ﬁnd a reading of the text below as it might have
sounded in the early nineteenth century. Listen and then read through the
text yourself. Note the words which have changed their pronunciations over
the course of the last two centuries. See if you can produce two columns, using
phonemic transcription, with what one might term (1) ‘outgoing forms’ (in
some cases already extinct) and (2) ‘incoming forms’, reﬂecting respectively
the characteristic pronunciations of previous eras, and pronunciations either
established in the twentieth century, or those now coming into vogue in the
twenty-ﬁrst. Check by looking at the key on the website.
I was all set to go to the theatre in Coventry Street last Wednesday. I’d bought
seats in the balcony for me and Sophia and was just putting on a waistcoat 
when I lost my footing and knocked my forehead on a painting – not the 
portrait of nephew Ralph but that huge landscape I got at the auction in Holborn.
I went over to contemplate my bruised proﬁle in the looking-glass. It was
exquisitely odious. No easy cure to be sure – but off to the chemist to get 
some iodine. Even though it wasn’t the result of a controversy, etiquette
demands that I re-schedule all my plans. Truly lamentable. Shan’t see the 
girl again either. Soon she’ll be gadding off towards Prague – lucky thing! 
Via Marseilles, Lyons and Milan. And I’ll have to stay in my rooms in 
Lewisham. And no peace or privacy – Aunt Maria’s coming across from
Cirencester.
What of the future?
We’ve now looked brieﬂy at the history of pronunciation change, and got some impres-
sion of the changes which have taken place recently, and of what appears to be going
on at the moment. But what of the future? How will the pronunciation of British English
sound in ﬁfty or a hundred years’ time?
125 Estuary English revisited ( Tracks 3, 43 and 2)
Now you have more phonetic knowledge and awareness, and know what to
listen for, ﬁrst go back and play the Estuary English sample ( Track 3, 
p. 6). Then listen to  Track 43, p. 169, so as to compare Matthew’s Estuary
English with that of our Cockney speaker, Steve. And ﬁnally listen to Daniel,
our speaker of modern NRP ( Track 2, p. 5).
What are the similarities and the differences? Consider features such as 
glottalisation and glottal replacement, h-dropping, degrees of diphthong

shift, l-vocalisation and th-stopping. To what extent does Matthew’s speech
coincide with Peter Trudgill’s description of ‘Estuary English’? (see Section D,
pp. 290–3)
A good website with much material on Estuary English (and much specula-
tion!) can be found at http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/home.htm
Traditional RP is certainly on its way out, and NRP is in the process of taking its
place. But will NRP in its turn be swallowed up by a new upstart – Estuary English?
No one knows, and in the case of language change, it’s very difﬁcult to anti-
cipate the course of events. Many of the speculations made in the past about changes
in English pronunciation have turned out to be quite wrong. Only a few were
resoundingly correct, as for instance when Daniel Jones in a 1921 newspaper article
observed that glottal stop (at the time a heavily stigmatised feature of basilectal
accents) was ‘spreading everywhere’ and that by the year 2000 British people would,
for instance, pronounce mutton as [Bmwm5] (Collins and Mees 1996: 178). The British
love of mutton is a thing of the past, but Daniel Jones’s prediction about the pro-
nunciation of the word has certainly come true. Glottal stop is now ﬁrmly embedded
in English pronunciation at all social levels.
The situation in London and the south-east of England today could be presented
as follows. In each case, the headings range from acrolectal on the left to basilectal on
the right:
Present day
Traditional RP – NRP – Estuary English – mainstream Cockney – broad
Cockney dialect
It seems likely that if things continue as they are, the two outer conservative varieties,
traditional RP, and basilectal regional varieties such as broad Cockney dialect, will soon
become extinct, leaving us with a linguistic landscape for the south-east England as
depicted below.
Near future
NRP – Estuary English – mainstream Cockney
An interesting question then presents itself: will the inﬂuence of London spread out,
so that Estuary English becomes spoken widely all over the British Isles? Some linguists
think that’s already happening by a process they term ‘accent convergence’ – and they
foresee a situation where Estuary English replaces NRP, and becomes itself a prestige
accent at the top of the future sociolinguistic pyramid (as in Figure A1.1, p. 3).
Distant future 1
Estuary English – local regional accents
Others (like Peter Trudgill, see pp. 291–3) envisage a different structure, whereby 
each region has its own mesolectal variety – a range of local counterparts to Estuary

214
E X P L O R A T I O N
English based on the speech of regional capitals spreading into surrounding areas, 
probably with the survival of a national prestige accent like NRP alongside. This 
would give rise to what we might even term ‘Estuary Birmingham’, ‘Estuary Bristol’,
‘Estuary Manchester’, and so on.
Distant future 2
NRP – local regional mesolects – local regional basilects
Which of these scenarios will ﬁnally emerge? Or will some unforeseen fashion or event
change the whole picture? Is there, for instance, the possibility that Multicultural London
English (see p. 170) will expand out of its present territory in Inner London, and be
increasingly adopted by young white Londoners? Might it then lose its present ethnic
minority associations, replace Cockney and associated varieties, and be transformed
into an all-inclusive basilectal south-eastern English accent of the future? It’s inter-
esting to speculate, but only time will tell. One thing is certain, living languages never
stand still. So changes will take place and it’s a good bet that the older generation will
go on complaining about the way the younger generation speaks.
TEACHING AND LEARNING A FOREIGN LANGUAGE
Hierarchy of error
One of the most useful day-to-day applications of phonetics courses is learning 
the pronunciation of a foreign language. In this section we deal with (1) teaching 
English to non-native learners; (2) the problems native speakers of English have 
in learning a foreign language. We shall use the abbreviation L1 (i.e. ﬁrst language)
to refer to the learner’s mother tongue (also termed ‘source language’) and L2
(i.e. second language) to refer to the language which is being learned (also termed the
‘target language’).
In learning a language it is necessary to have realistic goals. Unless you begin in
your infancy, it is very unlikely that you will ever achieve a perfect command of a lan-
guage. Nowhere is this more true than of pronunciation. Even if you start in your
teens, and go to live in the country concerned, it is likely that you will have some traces
of a foreign accent all your adult life. If perfect pronunciation is your target then you
must accept that you will inevitably fall short of it. A realistic aim is therefore to speak
in a way which is clearly intelligible to your listeners and which does not distract, 
irritate or confuse them.
So a major consideration when dealing with pronunciation is to discover which
errors are the most signiﬁcant. Not all deviations from native-speaker pronunciation
are of equal importance (see Jenkins 2000). Some pass unnoticed whereas others may
be enough to cause total lack of comprehension on the part of the listener. In trying
to establish a hierarchy of error we must take into account the reactions of native 
speakers. In general terms we can rank errors in the following way.
C6

T E A C H I N G  A N D  L E A R N I N G  A  F O R E I G N  L A N G U A G E
215
1
Errors which lead to a breakdown of intelligibility.
2
Errors which give rise to irritation or amusement.
3
Errors which provoke few such reactions and may even pass unnoticed.
Obviously, the ﬁrst category of error listed above is crucial and requires the most atten-
tion from teacher and student. The second group can also be of signiﬁcance and are
often those features which draw attention to the foreignness of an accent. The third
category is of far less importance. In fact, it is unusual for an isolated error even of a
category 1 type above to lead to a breakdown of intelligibility. But an important fac-
tor – which is often underestimated or ignored in contrastive analysis – is that pro-
nunciation errors do not typically occur in isolation. Especially with beginners or less
proﬁcient speakers, the L2 speech of the learner is likely to be peppered with numer-
ous errors in every sentence. Consequently a build-up effect results and causes prob-
lems of intelligibility. For example, there may be confusion of fortis/lenis consonants,
together with loss of signiﬁcant vowel contrasts like kit–fleece and trap–dress. On
top of that, there may be problems with stress and rhythm. If one then adds the like-
lihood of other linguistic errors (for instance, grammatical, or choice of vocabulary)
then it’s not surprising that the English of non-natives can sometimes be difﬁcult, or
even impossible, to understand.
Below, examples will be given of each of the three types of error with an indica-
tion of speakers’ L1. Note that ‘widespread’ implies an error that is likely to be made
by people from a large number of language backgrounds.
Error rankings for English
For an overview, see Table C6.1, p. 217.
Category 1: Errors leading to potential breakdown of intelligibility
1
Confusion of crucial phonemic contrasts in vowel system, e.g. /x – ii/ (widespread),
/e – æ/ (German, Dutch), /$i – ai/ (West African languages), /b – w/ (Danish).
2
Confusion of fortis/lenis, e.g. ﬁnal fortis/lenis (German, Dutch, Danish, Russian),
/f – v/ (Dutch).
3
Consonant clusters (widespread, e.g. Arabic, Spanish).
4
Crucial consonant contrasts, e.g. /b – v/ (Spanish), /v – w/ (German), /f – h/
(Japanese), /l – n/ (some Chinese), /l – r/ (Japanese, some Chinese), /t– s/ (Greek).
5
Deletion of /h/ (widespread, e.g. French, Italian) or replacement by /x/ (Spanish).
6
Word stress, especially if not on initial syllable (widespread, e.g. French, West African,
Indian languages).
Category 2: Errors which evoke irritation or amusement
1
Inappropriate /r/ articulations, e.g. uvular [y] (French, German, Hebrew), strong
alveolar trills (general).
2
Dental fricative problems (‘th-sounds’) (widespread), e.g. replacement of /0/ 
by /t/ (Dutch) or /s/ (French, German, Danish); of /q/ by /d/ (Dutch) or /z/ 
(French, German), etc.
3
Less signiﬁcant vowel contrasts, e.g. /ui – k/ (widespread), /b – ci/ (widespread).
4
Incorrect allophones of /l/, especially replacement by dark l throughout (Portuguese,
Russian), or by clear l throughout (French, German, Italian).

216
E X P L O R A T I O N
5
Lack of weak and contracted forms (widespread).
6
Inappropriate rhoticism/non-rhoticism for particular models of pronunciation
(widespread).
7
Strong retroﬂex setting (Indian languages).
Category 3: Errors which provoke few such reactions and may even 
pass unnoticed
1
Intonation errors (widespread).
2
Lack of syllabic consonants (widespread).
3
Compound stress (widespread).
Contrastive/error analysis
Errors made by language learners frequently reﬂect the sound systems of their L1. 
If we compare the L1 sound system with that of the L2, we can often predict the 
nature of errors which they will make. Let’s take as an example the case of a speaker
of European Spanish (or Castellano, see below) learning English.
Spanish learners’ errors
Spanish lacks a phoneme contrast similar to English /b – v/, the Spanish /b/ having 
a range of allophones similar to the two English consonants. There will be regular 
deletion of /h/ or replacement by the velar fricative [x]. On the other hand, unlike
many languages, European Spanish has a voiceless dental fricative /0/, and [q] exists
as an allophone of /d/, even though in the latter case English words containing /d/
and /q/ will be regularly confused.
The syllable structure of Spanish is less complex than that of English. For example,
there are no onset clusters with initial /s/, and the possibilities in coda position are
far fewer (only ﬁnal /n l r s d 0/ occur with any frequency). Final consonants and 
consonant clusters in general are a major problem area for Spanish speakers. This 
means that spam will be produced by learners as */espan/ (better not let a Spanish
speaker loose on old Monty Python songs!).
European Spanish has a ﬁve-vowel system with a number of additional diphthongs.
There is no equivalent to the checked/free vowel distribution in English, nor are 
there any central vowels similar to /e $i w/. From this one would predict that a 
Spanish learner would have considerable problems with the English vowel system, 
and that the checked/free vowel contrasts and the central vowels would be especially
problematical. For example, vowel contrasts such as /x – ii, k – ui, æ – ai/ might 
pose difﬁculties.
Spanish has syllable-timed rhythm – very different from the stress-timed rhythm
of English (see Section B6). A characteristic of Spanish English is the absence of vowel
reduction in unstressed syllables. The range of intonation is less extended than in the
English of native speakers. Spanish learners will not possess the elaborate systems of
weak and contracted forms which characterise native-speaker English.

Japanese learners’ errors
Let’s now examine the situation of learners who speak Japanese – a language with far
more discrepancies from English.1 Again, many of the problems can be traced back
to the differences between the phonemic inventories of the two languages. A well-known
problem area is the English contrast /l – r/ as in rate – late or fright – ﬂight. This results
from the Japanese /r/ phoneme having a range of allophones which to English ears
sound similar to either English /l/ or /r/. As in Spanish, Japanese [b] and [v] are 
allophones of a single phoneme /b/; consequently learners confuse English words 
like banish – vanish and TB – TV. Japanese /h/ has an allophonic range comprising
[⁄ h ç]. In some contexts, Japanese /h/ transfers successfully into English, but there
is also negative transfer. Before the close back vowels goose and foot, learners
replace English /h/ by what English speakers perceive as a type of /f/ sound (actually,
it’s a bilabial fricative [⁄]), so that a Japanese attempt at who’d is heard as food. Preceding
close front vowels fleece and kit, the /h/ replacement is palatal fricative [ç]; to 
an English ear the Japanese pronunciation of he sounds a little like she. Phonetic 
training is helpful in all of these cases to assist the learners in knowing which 
allophone is appropriate for which phonetic context.
Like many languages, Japanese lacks dental fricatives. Learners replace English /0/
by /s/, and /q/ by /z/, making theme sound like seem, and breathe like breeze. In Japanese,
alveolar consonants /s z t d n/ are palatalised (see pp. 58–60) before /i/. This feature
is transferred to English so that before close front fleece and kit, /s/ sounds like English
palato-alveolar /t/, blurring the contrast /s – t/ and making seat sound like sheet; the
contrast /z – n/ is also affected.
Like Spanish, Japanese has an economical basic vowel system of just ﬁve vowels.
English checked/free vowel contrasts such as fleece–kit, goose–foot (e.g. beat – bit
and pull – pool) indeed prove problematical. Nevertheless, since Japanese has many
vowel sequences which have some similarities to English long vowels and diphthongs
(see pp. 238–9), it is possible with phonetic training and practice for learners to 
approximate to a wider range of English vowel sounds. Japanese speakers will still ﬁnd
it difﬁcult to master the differences in vowel length resulting from pre-fortis clipping
(see p. 58), but, once again, raising phonetic awareness can be of great help. As in
Spanish, a crucial gap is the complete lack of any central vowels. Problems arise with
English /e/ (the bonus vowel), both in weak forms (see pp. 21–5) and with vowel reduc-
tion in unstressed syllables. As a ﬁrst step, learners should be made aware that any
letter can represent /e/. Japanese learners regularly replace the central nurse vowel
by palm, so that stir sounds like star. English trap, strut and palm may all be per-
ceived by learners as Japanese /a/, and this will transfer to pronunciation so that hut
and hat, and possibly heart, all sound alike.
Japanese has simpler syllable structure than English (see p. 239). Since in Japanese
only one consonant – the velar/uvular nasal [n] – can occur as a coda, learners will
have problems with English closed syllables. The lack of Japanese ﬁnal nasal contrasts
1 Thanks to Masaki Taniguchi for much help with this section.

T E A C H I N G  A N D  L E A R N I N G  A  F O R E I G N  L A N G U A G E
219
transfers to English so that syllable-ﬁnal nasals /m n f/, as in the words ram, ran and
rang, all sound the same. A serious Japanese error is to add an epenthetic vowel to 
a word-ﬁnal consonant, e.g. ‘petto’ pet, ‘dokku’ dog. Except before /j/, no consonant
clusters exist in Japanese, and learners also often add epenthetic vowels to English 
with most unfortunate results, e.g. club as [kurabu] and dream as [doriimu]. These
superﬂuous vowels are perhaps the most signiﬁcant errors for beginners, regularly 
leading to intelligibility breakdown.
Japanese intonation has a narrower pitch range than English and learners ﬁnd it
difﬁcult to distinguish a nucleus. Nevertheless, on the whole, intonation is not a major
problem. Far more signiﬁcant are the complications of mora-based rhythm (see 
pp. 239–40), which mean that Japanese rhythm is much closer to syllable-timing than
it is to the stress-timing of English. This, together with the lack of vowel reduction
(see above), and absence of weak forms, explains why learners ﬁnd it difﬁcult to reduce
the length of English unstressed syllables.
A useful simpliﬁed summary of Japanese learners’ errors in English is provided
by Shimizu (2010).
Other language backgrounds
The problems of learners from other language backgrounds also reﬂect transferred
features of their L1s. For example, speakers of Polish and Italian – languages which
have simple vowel systems with no central vowels – will have difﬁculties with the com-
plexities of the richer English vowel system. In particular, the English central vowels,
such as bonus, nurse and strut, prove major problems. Even if you speak a language
with a complex vowel system like French, errors may arise from gaps in the L1. 
In fact, French learners of English stumble over checked vs. free vowel contrasts 
(confusing the kit–fleece vowels), and the diphthongs vs. steady-state vowels 
(confusing goat and thought).
An overall lack of word-ﬁnal lenis consonants affects English learners from many
language backgrounds including German and Polish. This implies that pairs such as
bet – bed, safe – save will be confused. Apart from Spanish, none of the languages we
have dealt with have dental fricatives similar to /0 q/, so that learners from all the other
language backgrounds we discuss here usually replace these sounds with /t d/ or /s z/,
e.g. these things as /diiz Btxfz/ or /ziiz Bsxfz/. We have already mentioned that English
/h/ poses problems for Spanish and Japanese learners of English, and this also applies
to learners with French, Italian or Polish as L1. The articulation of English post-
alveolar /r/ is frequently an obstacle (especially for beginners) for French and Germans,
whose /r/ is uvular. Unlike Japanese and Spanish learners, speakers of Polish, German
or French will have fewer problems with English consonant clusters, since their own
languages contain many complex consonant sequences.
Although languages show considerable intonational variation, and exact mimicry
of intonation patterns is extremely difﬁcult for most learners, deﬁciencies in this area
hardly ever cause any breakdown in intelligibility, so its importance should not be
overestimated. Much more signiﬁcant is rhythm, and the impact of English stress-
timing (see pp. 135–8), where speakers from many language backgrounds, including
French, Spanish, Italian, Polish and Japanese, will encounter difﬁculties. French

220
E X P L O R A T I O N
speakers, whose language lacks word stress and has invariable nucleus location, have
particular problems here. On the other hand, speakers of German, Dutch or
Scandinavian languages, whose L1s also have stress timing similar to English, are at 
a considerable advantage.
It will be seen that the main areas of difﬁculty for learners can indeed be largely
predicted from contrastive analysis. Interestingly, not all learners’ difﬁculties can be
predicted in this way, while some expected problems may fail to materialise. It is, 
however, no exaggeration to say that a great many second-language pronunciation
problems can indeed be traced back to the sound system of the learners’ L1.
Other errors may arise through difﬁculties derived from confusing spelling sys-
tems – particularly in the case of target languages like English (or French or Danish),
which have archaic orthography incorporating many perplexing sound–spelling 
relationships. In other cases, we may be faced with teaching traditions which are 
inaccurate or out of date – this may be the reason for the German reluctance to 
distinguish trap and dress when two reasonably adequate vowels for the contrast
exist in their L1 (namely /a/ as in acht ‘eight’ and /™/ as in Bett ‘bed’).
For an overview of the chief learners’ pronunciation errors from a variety of 
languages, see Table C6.1, p. 217. For a general survey and discussion of the many
factors involved in teaching the pronunciation of a language to non-native learners,
see the extract from Avery and Ehrlich (1992), reprinted in Section D4 (pp. 258–61).
Hints on teaching pronunciation to non-native learners
It is essential to decide on a model for your students – this will normally be either
British NRP or General American, for the reasons outlined in Section A1. Your own
speech does not have to conform to the model but you should be aware of where 
you deviate markedly from it.
You should also make yourself aware of the problems your students have by 
giving them brief diagnostic tests. If you’re based in a non-English-speaking country,
and your students all have the same L1, you can assume that they will probably have
a large number of pronunciation problems in common. If, as is generally the case when
teaching in an English-speaking country, you’re faced with students from many dif-
ferent language backgrounds, you have to approach the problems of each nationality
separately.
In all cases, your task will be helped if you gain some phonetic knowledge of the
L1s of the students in your classes. There are a number of practical ways in which this
can be done. If, for example, you are teaching a class of Italian students, you can:
q
use books and audio material designed to teach Italian;
q
read courses on English, aimed at Italians, where pronunciation problems are 
discussed;
q
talk about the pronunciation of Italian with the students themselves;
q
try to learn at least a smattering of Italian (see p. 221 on learning a foreign 
language);
q
go to websites for information (Wikipedia has useful descriptions of many 
languages).

How to learn a foreign language
How can phonetics help you if you’re an English native speaker learning a foreign lan-
guage? If you have acquired the language in school, perhaps the ﬁrst thing to recognise
is that you may need to do a lot of repair work. Many language teachers feel they do
not have sufﬁcient time to give their students prolonged pronunciation training. Some,
indeed, devote no time to it whatsoever. All too often, language labs, where they exist,
are locked up gathering dust whilst the students who should be allowed to use them
plod away on written exercises.
Nevertheless, it’s amazing how quickly great improvements can be achieved in
your pronunciation by applying a few basic phonetic principles.
1
Choose an appropriate variety as a model and stick to it.
2
Discover differences and similarities between the target language and English in
terms of:
q
consonant and vowel systems;
q
sound and spelling relationships;
q
stress, rhythm and other features of connected speech.
Here are four concise overviews which will help you use your phonetic expertise
to gain a better understanding of the pronunciation of Spanish, French, German and
Italian – all very popular languages for non-natives to learn. We go on to discuss 
two major languages, Japanese and Polish, which are less commonly studied outside
their national borders, but which have many interesting phonetic/phonological features.
Note that these summaries are all very brief and deliberately simpliﬁed.

There may be as many as 350 million native speakers of Spanish worldwide. This implies
that Spanish has overtaken English as the second most widely spoken language in the
world (after Mandarin Chinese) in terms of native speakers, although not in terms of
total language usage.
Over 40 million native speakers, plus 5 million ﬂuent bilinguals, live in Spain itself.
It is worth noting that Spain not only has a number of regional varieties but also 
has several other languages spoken within its borders, e.g. Catalan, Galician and the
non-Indo-European language Basque. Castellano /kasteBjano/ is the term used in the
Spanish-speaking world for the educated variety spoken in northern Spain, including
the capital Madrid and the provinces of Castile. This is the model of Spanish usually
chosen by European learners, but an alternative is a Latin American variety, such as
Argentine Spanish. European and Latin American Spanish are at variance in many
respects, but the most signiﬁcant pronunciation difference is the existence in Castellano
of a phoneme /0/ used for orthographic z (e.g. zapata ‘shoe’) and for c preceding front
vowels (cinco ‘ﬁve’). In all of Latin America, and also in Andalusia in the south of
Spain, /s/ is employed in this context. As is always the case in language learning and
teaching, it is best to be consistent – choose one model and stick to it. We shall assume
in what follows that you are a British NRP speaker aiming at Castellano.

All vowels can combine to form diphthongs, but only /ei ai au oi/ commonly occur.
Vowel sequences having initial /i/ and /u/ are regarded as semi-vowels /j/ and /w/. 
See below.
Description of consonants
A new sound which must be mastered by the English learner of Spanish is the velar
fricative /x/ – spelt j or g (before i and e), as in jefe ‘boss’, general ‘general’. Double
ll, as in paella, was traditionally a palatal lateral [o] (a rough approximation is to pro-
nounce it as in English /lj/), but is nowadays overwhelmingly said as [j] (far easier for
an English learner to copy).
Unlike non-rhotic English, Spanish /r/ is pronounced in all contexts; deleting 
/r/ is a common British learner’s error. The Spanish sounds are also articulated very
differently from English /r/, being typically a tongue-tip trill /r/ or tap /?/. A major
problem occurs in word-medial position where single r (alveolar tap) and double rr
(alveolar trill) produce minimal pairs, contrasting, for example, para ‘for’ and parra
‘grapevine’.
The tilde ˜ accent placed over ñ indicates a palatal nasal /8/ as in mañana
‘tomorrow’. Replacement by /nj/ similar to English onion is only an approximation,
but it doesn’t seriously affect intelligibility.
The voiced plosive consonants /b d g/ have weaker voiced fricative allophones 
[β q +]. The plosive allophones occur word-initially and following nasals; the fricatives
are used elsewhere.
It is recommended, if you’re imitating Castellano, that c (before front vowels) and
z are pronounced as /0/ rather than /s/. In Spain, using /s/ in this context is associated
with particular regional varieties and may attract social comment.
Description of vowels
Standard Spanish has an attractively simple ﬁve-vowel /i e a o u/ system plus a 
number of diphthongs, the most signiﬁcant of these being /ei ai oi au/. The two main
problems are:
q
to avoid diphthongisation of /o/ and /e/ (which will cause confusion with diph-
thongs /ei/ and /ou/);
q
to avoid reducing unstressed vowels to [e]. (Note that there is no central vowel
of any kind in Spanish.)

Spelling
In general, Spanish orthography is highly reliable and efﬁcient. Nevertheless, there are
potential pitfalls. Note that h is invariably a ‘silent letter’ and either the letter b or v
could be regarded as superﬂuous as they are exact equivalents, both representing /b/.
The letter combination qu represents [k] queso ‘cheese’; c represents [0] before front
vowels i and e, e.g. cine ‘cinema’, cero ‘zero’ but [k] elsewhere: calle ‘street’.
Vowel spellings in Spanish are very straightforward with effectively no complications.
Connected speech
Word stress in Spanish operates on a basic rule system whereby stress falls regularly
on the penultimate syllable if the word ends in a vowel, n or s, e.g. venBtana, ‘window’,
Bmanos ‘hands’, Bcantan ‘they sing’. Words ending in a consonant (other than n or s)
are stressed on the ﬁnal syllable, e.g. aniBmal ‘animal’, coBñac ‘brandy’, haBblar ‘to speak’,
etc. All of the fairly large number of words which are exceptions to these rules have
stress indicated by an accent placed over the stressed syllable, e.g. volcán ‘volcano’,
cámara ‘room’, compás ‘compass’, difícil ‘difﬁcult’. Note that word stress is signiﬁcant
in Spanish and can change the meaning of words: término (noun) ‘end’, termíno 
‘I ﬁnish’, terminó ‘he ﬁnished’.
There is no reduction of unstressed syllables to a fully central vowel. Rhythm is
essentially syllable-timed, each syllable giving the impression of having roughly equal
duration. English speakers accustomed to the stress-timing of their own language have
to try to give every syllable in Spanish full value.
In Spanish, there is no clear separation of syllables across word boundaries. 
‘All the words seem to run into each other’ is one of the commonest complaints of
students attempting to acquire the language – and this feature is indeed one of the
major listening comprehension problem areas for the non-native learner.

Europe has perhaps as many as 70 million native speakers of French (over 60 million
in France, well over 4 million in Belgium, and 2 million in Switzerland). In addition,
there are approximately 7 million Canadian native speakers. There are also large num-
bers of second language speakers, most especially in vast areas of West and Central
Africa, where French is the ofﬁcial language.
Although France has many regional accents, only one variety of the language 
is normally chosen as a model for foreign learners. This is the educated standard 
variety of Paris and the north, which has no commonly used special name, but has
been termed français neutre (Lerond 1980).

The bands in the vowel diagram indicate vowels where there is a close relationship 
of some kind. The vowels /™/ and /c/ occur in closed syllables, whereas /e/ and /o/ are
found mostly in open syllables. Some speakers, mainly of the older generation, have
an additional nasal vowel /)/, as in un, brun /) br)/. Others (especially older
Parisians) make a distinction between two open vowels /a/ and /a/ as in patte ‘paw’
and pâte ‘paste’. Neither of these extra contrasts is nowadays heard in the French of
younger speakers of the standard language.
Description of consonants
While there is much overall similarity in the consonant systems of French and English,
there are also some notable differences. Unlike English /p t k/, French voiceless plos-
ives are unaspirated and never glottalised. Getting rid of aspiration and glottalisation
(see Section B2) is one of the most important problems the English-speaking learner
has to face. Unlike NRP, French /r/ is typically sounded in all contexts; it is a totally
different articulation from its English counterpart, being realised as a back tongue 
uvular approximant [z]. English post-alveolar /r/ is completely unacceptable if trans-
ferred to French. If you want to sound even remotely authentic in French, uvular [z]
is the one essential consonant to master.

French /l/ is invariably clear – there is no dark l as in NRP and most types of English
(modern English vocalised dark l may sound like a back vowel to French ears). Note
that ﬁnal m and n are not true consonants, but normally merely indicate that the 
preceding vowel is nasal (see below). The palatal nasal /8/ in cygne ‘swan’, in agneau
‘lamb’ can nowadays safely be replaced by /nj/.
Description of vowels
All French vowels can vary in duration, for instance being longer in open syllables,
but this vowel length is phonemically insigniﬁcant. Vowels are all steady-state, not
diphthongs, and it is important not to diphthongise vowels such as /o/ in beau
‘beautiful’ and /e/ in fée ‘fairy’. Two crucial features of the French sound system which
you have to master are (1) front rounded vowels and (2) nasal vowels.
(1) Front rounded vowels are made with the front of the tongue raised but with
rounded lips (see Section A6). They include /y/ as in tu ‘you’ (similar to a lip-rounded
[i] vowel), and /ø/ in peu ‘little’ (similar to a lip-rounded [e]); a third vowel /œ/ 
(similar to a lip-rounded [™]) occurs in closed syllables, e.g. neuf ‘nine’ /nœf/.
The vowel /y/, always spelt u, must be kept distinct from /u/, always spelt ou as
in tout ‘all’. There are many pairs where the meaning is dependent on this contrast.
Make sure that French /u/ is a true back vowel (lots of young NRP speakers produce
a fronted vowel for English /ui/). Many English speakers hear the vowels in peu and
neuf in terms of the vowel in nurse. However, the French vowels are strongly lip-
rounded and this rounding must be imitated. Check by looking in a mirror.
(2) There are three nasal vowels in French, namely /%/, as in vin ‘wine’ (similar
to a nasalised English /æ/), /&/, as in banc ‘bench’ (similar to an unrounded nasalised
English /b/), and /*/ as in bon ‘good’ (similar to a fully rounded nasalised English /ci/).
Note that it is essential to distinguish the vowels /&/ and /*/ (most English people don’t!).
On the other hand, the old /%/ – /)/ contrast, still taught in most British schools, is
superﬂuous. As mentioned above, the vowel /)/ is extinct in most standard modern French,
having effectively been replaced by /%/, e.g. /br%/ brun, ‘brown’, /l%di/ lundi ‘Monday’.
Note that many younger speakers use an open central vowel in between the two.
Nasal vowels are indicated in the spelling by syllable-ﬁnal n or m. These ortho-
graphic consonants are not themselves sounded, which means, for example, that 
conte ‘tale’ and compte ‘account, charge’ sound exactly the same: /k*t/.
Spelling
The French spelling system is archaic and full of confusing complexities, but it is essen-
tial to take note of spelling–sound relationships. ‘Silent consonants’ abound; to give just
a few examples: heure ‘hour’, nez ‘nose’, tabac ‘tobacco’, banc ‘bench’, sirop ‘syrup’, sot
‘stupid’, respect ‘respect’, frais ‘cold’, tard ‘late’. A number of words show variation:
août ‘August’ may be pronounced /ut/ or /u/; tous ‘all’ can be /tu/ or /tus/.
Silent consonants, especially in the commonest words, often return in connected
speech as liaison forms. Compare:
vous /vu/ ‘you’
vous avez /vuz ave/ ‘you have’
vingt /v%/ ‘twenty’
vingt-et-un /v%t e %/ ‘twenty-one’
Orthographic e (without any accent) is silent when word-ﬁnal (e.g. huile ‘oil’ /Çil/),
and often when word-medial; see below.

228
E X P L O R A T I O N
There are frequently numerous ways of indicating the same sound. For instance,
the words tan ‘tan’, taon ‘horseﬂy’, tant ‘so much’, tend ‘stretch’, temps ‘time, weather’
are homophones, all pronounced identically as /t&/, despite the different spellings.
Note that two of the orthographic accents of French are in phonetic terms largely
superﬂuous. The circumﬂex (G) no longer serves its original purpose of indicating vowel
length, and in reality there is no longer any consistent difference between è (accent
grave) and é (accent aigu or ‘acute’). However, the presence of an accent on e still has
a very important function: é indicates that the vowel is fully sounded and not reduced
to [e] or elided, cf. ménage /m™nan/ ‘household’ and menace /m(e)nas/ ‘threat’.
Note that on other vowels a grave accent serves only to distinguish words which
would otherwise be spelt identically (e.g. ou ‘or’ vs. où ‘where’), and has no phonetic
function.
Connected speech  Audio on website
Like Spanish, French has no clear separation of syllables across word boundaries. Learners
usually ﬁnd the effect of ‘words running into each other’ to be the most difﬁcult 
aspect of listening comprehension, while liaison processes (see above) add further 
complications.
Stress is not essential to the phonological structure of the word in French. This
makes French very different from English (or indeed most European languages)
where the correct placement of stress is crucial for the recognition of polysyllabic words.
See also Section B6.
In French, stress is predictable, falling on the ﬁnal syllable of any word or phrase
if pronounced in isolation, or on the ﬁnal syllable of each intonation group in con-
nected speech. (English-speaking learners of French are usually totally unaware of 
this important basic principle.) For example:  Audio on website
é Btat ¡
‘state’
les Etats-U Bnis ¡
‘the United States’
Je voudrais parBtir ¡ pour les Etats-U Bnis ¡ deBmain.¡ ‘I’d like to go to the United States
tomorrow.’
Furthermore, French is syllable-timed, which implies that one needs to pronounce 
all syllables with roughly equal force and length. An important extra complication –
especially in terms of listening comprehension – is that syllables spelt with unaccented
e (1) reduce to /e/ and (2) are almost invariably elided, so producing sequences of
two consonants, e.g. demi ‘half’ /demi/ →/dmi/, petit ‘small’ /peti/ →/pti/, boulevard
/bulevar/ →/bulvar/.  Audio on website
Note, however, that spoken French avoids sequences of three consonants, and where
these could potentially exist, orthographic e is sounded as /e/, e.g. carte bancaire ‘bank
card’ /karte b&k™r/. If no e occurs in the spelling, an epenthetic /e/ may be inserted,
e.g. un ﬁlm fantastique ‘a fantasy ﬁlm’ /% ﬁlme f&tastik/.

Italian is spoken throughout Italy and is one of Switzerland’s ofﬁcial languages.2 Although
there are many local accents and dialects, what is coming to be regarded as the stand-
ard language – and a model for non-native learners – is based on a geographically
central variety (including the city of Rome) but lacking marked regional features. This
accent is increasingly heard on the media and is sometimes referred to as ‘RAI’ /rai/
pronunciation (after the Italian national broadcasting service Radiotelevisione
Italiana).

Description of consonants
Most of the Italian consonants have counterparts in English, although often with con-
siderable phonetic differences. See below for the signiﬁcance of consonant doubling
and spelling conventions.
Consonant doubling
All consonants, except /z n j w/, can be ‘doubled’ – an effect which in Italian is termed
raddoppiamento. Doubling a consonant not only lengthens the consonant itself but
also shortens the preceding vowel. These effects can at ﬁrst be difﬁcult for the begin-
ner to hear and might therefore be thought unimportant – but nothing could be 
further from the truth! To Italians it is one of the most signiﬁcant features of the 
language, and it can often change or blur the meaning in a pair of words, e.g. nono
‘ninth’ /Bncno/ vs. nonno ‘grandfather’ /Bncnno/. Other examples (with a different 
mid-vowel) are: sete ‘thirst’ /Bsete/ vs. sette ‘seven’ /Bs™tte/ and velo ‘veil’ /Bvelo/ vs. vello
‘ﬂeece’ /Bv™llo/. Note that raddoppiamento is not only indicated by a double letter but
also by the spellings sc, z, gl and gn (see below).
Start imitating Italian doubling by taking account of a similar effect in English
which normally occurs across word boundaries. If you say phrases like hard disk, rough
figures, nice sauce, one nation, and full length, you’ll notice that you’re not in fact 
articulating two separate consonants, [d d, f f, s s, n n, l l], but just a single prolonged
consonant sound: [di, fi, si, ni, li]. This effect is somewhat similar to Italian rad-
doppiamento. In addition to the doubling indicated in the spelling, Italian also has
word-initial doubling, usually termed raddoppiamento (fono)sintattico, triggered by con-
tact with certain ‘doubling’ words, as in a te /atBte/ ‘to you’. This phenomenon shows
much regional variation and is in fact absent from most northern accents. If you’re
aiming merely at intelligibility, it’s of little signiﬁcance.
New sounds which the learner needs to master are: (1) the palatal lateral /o/, as
in aglio ‘garlic’ and (2) the palatal nasal /8/ as in bagno ‘bath(room)’. These sounds
can be approached by modifying English /lj/ and /nj/, as in million and onion. Even
without modiﬁcation there should be little problem with intelligibility.
Italian is rhotic (unlike NRP English) and /r/ is sounded wherever indicated by
spelling. Italian /r/ is typically realised as a tap although it is sometimes pronounced
as a tongue-tip trill in emphatic speech: raro [B?a?o] ‘rare, infrequent’. Doubling gives
rise to pairs like caro [Bka?o] ‘dear’ and carro [Bkaro] ‘cart’.
Italian /l/ is invariably clear. You may ﬁnd that Italians perceive your English dark
l as an [u] type back vowel.
Although [f] isn’t a phoneme in Italian, it functions as an allophone of /n/ in
pre-velar contexts, e.g. banca ‘bank’ /banka/ [Bbafka].
Unlike English, the Italian voiceless plosives /p t k/ are unaspirated and never glot-
talised; the voiced plosives /b d g/ have stronger voicing. Italian /t d/ are dental rather
than alveolar. When stops are affected by doubling, only the hold stage is lengthened
(see p. 90 for a similar effect in English). Italian has four phoneme affricates: /ts dz 
tt dn/. Intial z is today usually pronounced as /dz/, although /ts/ is sometimes also 
to be heard: zucca /Bdzukka/ or /Btsukka/ ‘pumpkin’. Medial z can be either /ts/ or /dz/,
e.g. razza /Brattsa/ ‘race’ and /Braddza/ ‘ray (sea ﬁsh)’. There are no reliable guidelines

232
E X P L O R A T I O N
for such variation. Both /s/ and /z/ occur as phonemes, not dissimilar from their English
counterparts; confusingly, both sounds are spelt with the letter s (see below).
Description of vowels
Like Spanish, Italian has a simple basic vowel system together with a number of diph-
thongs. There are seven steady-state vowels in standard Italian /i, e, ™, a, c, o, u/; except
for /a/, all the vowels have close to cardinal values. Many regional accents have only
ﬁve vowels, not distinguishing the mid-vowel pairs: /e/ vs. /™/ and /o/ vs. /c/. Standard
Italian also ﬂuctuates between /e, ™/ and /o, c/, even in the same word: collega, for
instance, is in traditional pronunciation /kolBl™ga/ when it means ‘colleague’ and /kolBlega/
when it means ‘it connects’, but in fact many Italians today can regularly be heard 
to say /kolBl™ga/ for both. In consequence, the distinction between /e, ™/ and /o, c/
may not be of great importance for the non-native if you are aiming merely at 
intelligibility.
Unlike English diphthongs, which have a weaker second element, Italian diph-
thongs show little such effect. English learners should therefore pronounce fully the
ﬁnal element in words such as mai /mai/ ‘never, ever’, poi /pci/ ‘then’, voi /voi/ ‘you’
(pl.), dei /d™i/ ‘gods’, dei /dei/ ‘some’, auto /Bauto/ ‘car’. Furthermore, the ﬁrst ele-
ments in diphthongs beginning with [i] or [u] are generally said as /j/ and /w/: dieci
/Bdj™tti/ ‘ten’, uomo /Bwcmo/ ‘man’, although in less rapid – or more emphatic – speech,
/diB™tti/ and /uBcmo/ are also sometimes to be heard.
Unlike NRP English, Italian vowel length is not phonemic and is largely predictable.
As a general rule, a vowel is phonetically long when followed by a single consonant
which is initial in a following syllable, e.g. mano [Bmaino] ‘hand’. In other cases 
vowels are normally short. Remember the vowel shortening effect of consonant 
doubling (see above).
The most important errors to tackle are: (1) avoiding diphthongal glides similar
to the English vowels face /ex/ and goat /ek/, where Italian has the steady-state 
vowels /e ™/ and /o c/; and (2) avoiding vowel reduction to [e] or [x] in unstressed
syllables (standard Italian has no central vowels of this type).
Spelling
Italian spelling is more complex than that of Spanish but nevertheless presents far fewer
problems than the orthographic horrors of English or French.
Word-initial letter s may indicate either /s/ as in solo ‘only, alone’ or, if combined
with a voiced consonant, /z/, as in sbaglio /Bzbaooo/ ‘mistake’, sguardo /Bzgwardo/ ‘look’
(n.), smalto /Bzmalto/ ‘enamel’. In other contexts, s may represent either /s/ or /z/:
casa /Bkaza, -sa/ ‘house, home’. There are no clear guidelines but incorrect usage is
unlikely to cause misunderstanding. The letter combination sc is pronounced as /t/
before e and i, e.g. scendere ‘descend’, and as /sk/ before a, o and u, e.g. scarpa ‘shoe’,
scusa ‘excuse’, and when letter h intervenes, e.g. pesche ‘peaches’. Letter z may be either
/ts/, as in silenzio /siBl™ntsjo/ ‘silence’, or /dz/, as in zero /Bdz™ro/ ‘zero’. Once again,
there are no clear guidelines. Both pronunciations are usually found word-initially as
alternatives, e.g. zia /dzia, tsia/ ‘aunt’.
Letter h occurs rarely (mostly in foreign loanwords) and is not pronounced, e.g.
hotel /oBt™l/ ‘hotel’. See below for ch and gh.

T E A C H I N G  A N D  L E A R N I N G  A  F O R E I G N  L A N G U A G E
233
Before front vowels (e and i), c is pronounced as /tt/ (similar to English /tt/), 
e.g. centrale /ttenBtrale/ ‘central’, circa /Bttirka/ ‘approximately’. Before open and 
back vowels (a, o and u), letter c represents /k/, e.g. correre ‘to run’. The letter 
combination ch represents /k/, e.g. chiuso ‘closed’, while qu is used for /kw/, e.g. 
quattro ‘four’. Similarly, letter g, when preceding e or i, is pronounced /dn/, e.g. 
gelato ‘ice cream’, but as /g/ before a, o, u, e.g. gamba ‘leg’ and when h intervenes,
e.g. spaghetti.
The spelling of Italian vowels is extremely reliable apart from letter e represent-
ing both /e/ and /™/, and letter o both /o/ and /c/. In the case of ﬁnal stressed vowels,
an acute accent is usually employed to indicate /e/, and a grave accent for /™/, e.g. ﬁnché
‘until’, caffè ‘coffee’. However, elsewhere there are no clear guidelines on these mid
vowels.
Connected speech
Similarly to Spanish, standard Italian has no clear separation of syllables across 
word boundaries. Except in emphatic speech, Italian makes frequent use of elision,
dropping one of two adjacent identical vowels in phrases such as cinquanta anni
[ttifAkwanBtanni] ‘ﬁfty years’. This kind of simpliﬁcation process is also to be found
when non-identical vowels are involved, as in otto e trenta [ActtetBtr™nta] ‘half past 
eight’.
Stress, rhythm and intonation
Italian is similar to English in having clearly deﬁned word stress and sentence stress.
Words are mostly stressed on the penultimate syllable, but nevertheless a signiﬁcant
number (including many high frequency items) are stressed elsewhere. Final stress 
is marked with an accent (see above) but unfortunately this is not usually used for
earlier stressing.
Stress in longer Italian words is somewhat tricky. Words like salubre ‘healthy’, for
instance, tend to ﬂuctuate between stress on the penultimate /saBlubre/ as opposed to
the antepenultimate /Bsalubre/. Despite being extremely widespread, the antepenultimate
pattern is often regarded as ‘incorrect’ by Italian native speakers, including elocutionists
and certain linguists.
Unlike English, Italian connected speech has syllable-timed rhythm (see 
pp. 137–8), with most syllables having roughly equal duration. In the standard 
language (as stated above) there is neither reduction of vowels in unstressed syllables
to [e] or [x], nor are there any weak forms (see pp. 21–5). The use of such incorrect
English-type vowel reductions in unstressed syllables is a frequent source of error for
English-speaking learners of Italian.
However, Italian intonation does show some features similar to English. Notably,
there is regularly one obviously prominent lengthened syllable in the intonation
group, corresponding to the nucleus. Furthermore, certain Italian intonation tunes
bear some similarity to those of English, and may have similar implications.

Model
German has about 90 million native speakers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
Estimates of second-language usage vary widely.
The model usually chosen for non-native learners is educated northern German, 
as heard on TV and radio. Regional and national varieties of German differ widely, 
especially in Bavaria, Austria and Switzerland. Swiss German, in its spoken form, is
effectively a different language.

The more open /e/ is the allophone before ﬁnal /r/. Since most speakers of standard
German only sound /r/ before vowels, it is only this more open allophone that
provides a contrast in pairs such as: Fische – Fischer ‘ﬁshes’ – ‘ﬁsherman’. It may
be represented phonetically as [O].
Description of consonants
Like its French counterpart, German /r/ is a back (uvular) approximant. However,
unlike French, syllable-ﬁnal r is normally unsounded. This means that German is 
effectively non-rhotic, but note that the orthographic ﬁnal r does have an effect on
the length or quality of the preceding vowel. German /l/ is clear in all contexts, and
as a result many varieties of English dark l might sound vowel-like to German ears.
Apart from clear l, the velar fricative [x], as in acht ‘eight’, Buch ‘book’, rauchen
‘to smoke’, and the palatal fricative [ç], as in nicht ‘not’, schlecht ‘bad’, durch ‘through’,
are the most difﬁcult consonants. Both are spelt ch; they are largely in an allophonic 
relationship, [ç] occurring after front vowels and also consonants, and [x] elsewhere.
Many linguists in fact consider them to be allophones of the same phoneme. Note
that non-ﬁnal orthographic s is pronounced /z/, as in Seite /Bzaxte/ ‘page’; orthographic
z is an affricate /ts/, e.g. Zeit /Btsaxt/ ‘time’.
Description of vowels
Vowel length is important in German, which has a checked/free contrast similar to
English. The greatest problems for most students are the front rounded vowels, two
long and two short: /yi . øi œ/, all indicated in the spelling by an umlaut, e.g. grün
‘green’ /gryin/, hübsch ‘pretty’ /h.pt/, schön ‘beautiful’ /tøin/, zwölf ‘twelve’ /tsvœlf/.
Vowels /ei oi/, e.g. zehn ‘ten’, so ‘so’ are steady-state. The close vowels /ii ui/ (e.g. tief
‘deep’ /tiif/ and Schuh /tui/ ‘shoe’) are peripheral and not diphthongised.
Spelling
Although not as efﬁcient as that of Spanish, German orthography is much more 
reliable than that of English or French, with a good correspondence between sound
and spelling. It is important to absorb the rules for vowel length; the most signiﬁcant
are perhaps that long vowels are shown with double vowel letters or h, e.g. Saal /zail/
‘hall’, Wahl /vail/ ‘choice’, and short vowels are often followed by double consonant
letters, e.g. dann /dan/ ‘then’. Even so, there are exceptions.
Connected speech
Unlike Spanish and French, Standard German has clear word separation, and stressed
initial vowels are typically preceded by a glottal stop, e.g. einundachtzig ‘eighty-one’
[Bmaxn knt Bmaxtsxç]. This is totally different from English, where the ﬁnal consonants
tend to be linked to the following word, e.g. an apple [e næpl]. English students 
have to avoid using linking and intrusive r, e.g. in aber ich ‘but I’ or meine Absicht
‘my intention’.
Word stress
This has similarities to English, with each word having an obvious stressed syllable.
There is considerable vowel reduction in unstressed syllables to /e/, generally affecting

T E A C H I N G  A N D  L E A R N I N G  A  F O R E I G N  L A N G U A G E
237
orthographic e, e.g. Bekannte ‘acquaintance’. Rhythm, as in English, is stress-timed,
i.e. it is essentially based on intervals between stresses.

Description of consonants
Certain Japanese consonants have counterparts in English, although often with con-
siderable phonetic differences. Other English consonants, namely /f v 0 q r l/, have
no such direct counterparts in Japanese.
Before /i/, Japanese /s z/ are realised as [n m], e.g. shiika (
‘poetry’) /síika/
[niika], aji (
‘taste’) /azi/ [ami]. The Japanese /h/ is palatalised before /i/, being realised
as a voiceless palatal fricative [ç] as in hikari (
‘light’) /hikari/ [çikarí]. Before /u/,
it is realised as a bilabial fricative [⁄], and before the remaining vowels as glottal frica-
tive [h]. However, in the past ﬁfty years or so, it’s become possible to use [⁄] before
/i a e o/ in addition to /u/. Consequently, for many younger speakers, it’s possible to
consider this consonant as an extra independent phoneme /f/.
The realisation of coda /n/ is determined by the place of articulation of the 
following consonant, i.e. [m] before bilabials, [n] before alveolars and [f] before 
velars, e.g. kenmei (
‘wise’) /kenmei/ [kemmei], tennen (
‘nature’) /tennen/
[tennen], ténki (
‘weather’) /ténki/ [téfki]). In an open syllable the realisation is
as a nasal vowel, e.g. án (
‘idea’) /án/ [áã], ín (
‘seal’) /ín/ [í#], ún (
‘fortune’)
/ún/ [úo].
Description of vowels
Japanese has ﬁve short vowels: /i e a o u/, as illustrated in the diagram. Japanese /u/ is
a close back vowel which can be realised as either unrounded or slightly rounded, and
is generally accompanied by lip compression. An unusual feature of Japanese is that
the close vowels, /i/ and /u/, are devoiced and often elided when they occur between
voiceless consonants, or in unaccented syllable-ﬁnal position following a voiceless con-
sonant, e.g. kishi (
‘shore’) /kisí/ [cpni, cni], kushi (
‘comb’) /kusí/ [kqni, kni].
Japanese has no true diphthongs or long vowels. Native-speaker intuition deter-
mines that what may sound like diphthongs and long vowels to English (or non-Japanese)
ears are treated phonologically as vowel sequences. A vowel sequence consisting of
i
u
e
o
a

239
two different vowels will sound somewhat like a diphthong; a double identical vowel
sequence sounds like a long vowel.
All vowels can enter into vowel sequences in Japanese. With sequences of differ-
ent vowels, those with a rising tongue movement similar to a closing diphthong, e.g.
saiwai (
‘happiness’) /saiwai/ [saiwai], are much more frequent than those with
a lowering tongue movement similar to opening diphthongs, e.g. shiawase (
‘happiness’) /siawase/ [niawase]. The double identical vowel sequences are all about
equally common, e.g. haaku (
‘grasp’) /haaku/ [haaku], ii (
‘good’) /íi/ [ii],
yuu (
‘tie’) /júu, juu/ [júu, juu], keeki (
‘cake’) /kéeki/ [kéeci], Isaka (
Osaka (place name)) /oosaka/ [oosaka].
Syllable structure
Japanese has a simple basic syllable structure of (CC)V(C), i.e. an obligatory vowel
with the possibility of up to two consonants in the onset and one consonant in the
coda. The second onset consonant is invariably /j/. The coda consonant is either (1)
the velar/uvular mora (see below) nasal /n/, or (2) a mora obstruent shown phonologic-
ally as /Q/. The mora obstruent is realised by consonant doubling, e.g. ippai (
)
‘one cup’ /íQpai/ [íppai]/, sakka (
) ‘writer’ /saQka, sáQka/ [sakka, sákka].
Writing systems
Japanese is notorious for the complicated nature of its writing systems – there are no
fewer than four in total! They comprise kanji (
) (derived from Chinese charac-
ters), hiragana (
), katakana (
) and romanisation. In the Japanese
kanji system, each character can have more than one pronunciation, often with 
different meanings, which has led to the invention of hiragana and katakana. In 
both hiragana and katakana each symbol has a ﬁxed pronunciation representing a 
complete mora (so these systems are syllabic and not alphabetic). Hiragana is used
mainly for native Japanese words, whilst katakana is employed for foreign words 
and loan words.
Several romanisation alphabets have been devised for Japanese, but nowadays 
the Hepburn system – which we’ve employed here for the Japanese examples – is 
the most popular. It uses the familiar letters of the Roman alphabet, representing the
mora nasal by a letter n, and the mora obstruent by consonant doubling, e.g. sakka
‘writer’. A long (i.e. doubled) vowel is shown with a macron accent, e.g. Isaka
‘Osaka’ (place name).
Connected speech
An important aspect of Japanese phonology is the mora, which relates to the length
of a syllable. In brief, the typical Japanese CV syllable (e.g. na) is regarded as a single
mora. Syllables containing lengthening elements such as vowel sequences, long 
vowels, doubled consonants, or coda ﬁnal /n/ (e.g. mai, yuu, sakka, dan), contain 
two moras.
Japanese native speakers feel that Japanese rhythm is mora-timed, rather than 
syllable-timed or stress-timed, so that each mora has approximately the same dura-
tion. It becomes apparent when they recite haikus and other verse containing mora
nasals, mora obstruents and long vowels. A haiku normally consists of a ﬁve-mora

240
E X P L O R A T I O N
ﬁrst line, a seven-mora second line and a ﬁve-mora third line, giving in total 17 moras.
Kaki kueba kanega narunari HDryEji (
) ‘As I eat a 
persimmon, I hear the bell tolling from Horyuji temple’ is a haiku by the renowned
poet Shiki Masaoka. HDryEji consists of three syllables but ﬁve moras, each long vowel 
containing two moras. The song that begins with YEyake koyakeno akatonbo (‘red
dragonﬂies in the red sunset’) is sung ‘yu-u-ya-ke-ko-ya-ke-no-a-ka-to-n-bo’
(
) (hyphens indicate mora boundaries).
Intonation
Japanese is a pitch-accent language as opposed to the stress accent found in English.
Two pitch levels are used in Japanese: high (H) and low (L). Pitch drops sharply from
H to L immediately following an accented mora if there is one. In the examples above,
an accented mora is shown with an acute accent. Rising or falling intonation can be
added at the end of a sentence. For instance, atsui /atsúi/ (‘hot’) can take either a ris-
ing intonation /atsúi
/ ‘Is it hot?’ or a falling intonation /atsúi
/ ‘It’s hot’. The pitch
contour for the ﬁrst will be LHLH, and that for the second, LHL. For the ﬁrst, the
ﬁnal mora will be lengthened to allow an additional H.
Further information
A good brief treatment of the Japanese sound system is Okada (1999). For fuller detail,
see Vance (2008).

The oral vowels can be followed by glides towards [i] or [u]. The ﬁnal element is 
normally represented phonemically by /j/ or /w/ respectively, e.g. kij ‘stick’ /kij/, 
pis ‘he drank’ /piw/, mój ‘my’ /muj/, daj ‘give!’ /daj/, das ‘he gave’ /daw/.
Description of consonants
Let’s start with the most complex sounds. Learners from virtually all language back-
grounds experience difﬁculty distinguishing the Polish palato-alveolars /tn ttdn/ and
alveolo-palatals /n m tn dm/. English speakers initially perceive both sets as sounding
like the English palato-alveolars /t n tt dn/. Therefore it’s crucial to realise that in 
Polish the palato-alveolars and the alveolo-palatals are distinct phonemes. There are
countless minimal pairs, e.g. wiesz ‘you know’ /vj™t/ vs. wieX ‘village’ /vj™n/, miecz ‘sword’
/mj™tt/ vs. mieV ‘to have’ /mj™tn/.
For the palato-alveolars /tn ttdn/, start from English [tn], maintaining the rounded
protruding lip shape (see p. 40). Keep the blade of the tongue close to the alveolar
ridge, and the front of the tongue away from the hard palate. The alveolo-palatals 
/n m tn dm/ can also be formed from the English [t n]. Modify the articulation by: 
(1) unrounding and spreading the lips, and (2) raising the body of the tongue close
to the hard palate. Note that the friction of the palato-alveolars is graver than the 
relatively sharp friction of the alveolo-palatals.
For the palatal plosives /c s/, start from the English sequences /kj/ and /gj/ (as in
cute /kjuit/ and argue /aigjui/).The same place of articulation is used for /8/. Start
from the /nj/ in onion. When articulating any of these palatal sounds, remember to
hold the tip of the tongue down behind the lower front teeth. In the ﬂow of speech,
Polish /r/ is usually realised as a single tap [?] rather than a trill (see pp. 49–50). Polish
/l/ is invariably clear; unlike English, there is no dark l (see p. 74).
The remaining consonants should cause relatively few problems but remember
that, unlike English (see pp. 87–9), the Polish voiceless plosives are unaspirated and
never glottalised. Voiced obstruents are fully voiced.
As in German, word-ﬁnally all Polish obstruents /b d s g v z n m dz dn dm/ are
replaced by their voiceless counterparts /p t c k f s t n ts tt tn/. As a result of leading
voice assimilation, medial voiced obstruents are devoiced preceding an adjacent
voiceless obstruent, e.g. ryba ‘ﬁsh’ /Brrba/ becomes rybka ‘ﬁsh (diminutive)’ /Brrpka/.
Description of vowels
Like Spanish and Italian, Polish has an economical basic vowel system. It consists of
six short steady-state vowels (note there are no long vowels). Polish lacks [e], and English
speakers must avoid vowel reduction to [e] in unstressed syllables. Four Polish 
vowels /i ™c u/ are very similar to cardinal vowels (see pp. 64–7). English NRP 
speakers need to use a fully back vowel for /u/, and avoid making /i/ and /u/ either
long or diphthongal. A shortened square vowel will serve for Polish /™/, while Polish
/c/ is similar to a short thought vowel. The open central Polish /a/ is about halfway
between trap and palm. Polish /r/ is somewhat more difﬁcult to acquire, being about

T E A C H I N G  A N D  L E A R N I N G  A  F O R E I G N  L A N G U A G E
243
halfway between [e] and kit. It is similar to the English allophone of kit before dark
l, as in ill.
The nasal vowels occur only before fricatives, e.g. rzUsa ‘eyelash’ /Bn%sa/, wTY ‘snake’
/v*t/ and, in the case of /*/, in word-ﬁnal position, e.g. sT ‘they are’ /s*/. These vowels
have both steady-state [%, *] and diphthongal [%o, *o] allophones. The diphthongs 
are used for the names of the letters 5 and 0, and for /*/ when ﬁnal; in other contexts
usage varies.
Spelling
Whilst it may seem somewhat forbidding at ﬁrst, Polish orthography is actually very
consistent. A phoneme can sometimes be represented by different letters (or letter com-
binations), but any particular letter (or letter combination) can represent only one
sound. So there’s no difﬁculty in working out the pronunciation of an unknown word
from its spelling – but it’s not possible to deduce the spelling from a word’s pronun-
ciation. Consequently, quite a few Poles make spelling errors – even with familiar words.
(Since non-natives usually begin learning through the written medium, they have no
such difﬁculties.)
The following phonemes are spelt very much as might be expected.
q
i e a o = vowels /i ™a c/. Note that y represents /r/.
q
p b t d k g = plosives /p b t d k g/
q
f s z = fricatives /f s z/
q
m n l r = nasals, lateral and tap r /m n l r/
More unexpectedly: w = /v/ whilst ” = /w/; orthographic ki gi c dz cz d9 represent 
the phonemes /c s ts dz ttdn/. Three phonemes /x n u/ can be represented by two dif-
ferent spellings:
q
h or ch = /x/ (e.g. herbata ‘tea’ /x™rBbata/, chata ‘cottage’ /Bxata/)
q
9 or rz = /n/ (e.g. moYe ‘maybe’ /Bmcn™/, morze /Bmcn™/ ‘sea’)
q
u or ó = /u/ (e.g. but ‘shoe’ /but/, ból ‘pain’ /bul/)
Palatal approximant /j/ is generally spelt j, e.g. jak ‘how’ /jak/, klej ‘glue’ /kl™j/.
But note that it is represented by i after p b f w if preceding a vowel, e.g. piUta ‘heel’
/Bpj™nta/, kwiat ‘ﬂower’ /kfjat/. The phonemes /n m tn dm 8/ are written si zi ci dzi ni
before a vowel but as 8 ? 6 d? 7 both before a consonant and at the end of a word.
The nasal vowels only occur before fricatives; in other contexts, the letters 5 and 0
represent /™/ and /c/ plus the nasal consonant that is homorganic with the following
stop (e.g. dTb ‘oak’ /dcmp/, rUce ‘hands’ /Br™nts™/, piUkny ‘beautiful’ /Bpj™fknr/).
Word-ﬁnally, 5 represents non-nasal /™/. Note that the letters q v x are not used in
native Polish words.
Syllable structure
Polish syllables can have initial and ﬁnal clusters of up to four consonants, e.g. mnie
‘me’ /m8™/, ssak ‘mammal’ /ssak/, Vma ‘moth’ /tnma/, krtaW ‘larynx’ /krta8/, mgsa ‘fog’
/mgwa/, LdLbso ‘blade of grass’ /mdmbwc/, pstrTg ‘trout’ /pstrcfk/, warstw ‘layers
(gen.)’ /varstf/. Many of these clusters are unfamiliar to English speakers and difﬁcult
to combine.

244
E X P L O R A T I O N
In contrast with English, where an epenthetic plosive may be inserted in nasal-
fricative consonant sequences (see p. 124), in Polish the nasal consonant is elided and
the preceding vowel is nasalised e.g. kunszt ‘craftmanship’ [kott], szansa ‘chance’ [Btãsa].
Connected speech (stress and rhythm)
Polish word stress (with few exceptions), falls on the penultimate syllable, as can be
seen from the examples already cited. The Polish preference for penultimate stress is
also evident from the pronunciation of certain constructions where stress falls on the
ﬁrst of two monosyllabic words. This occurs:
q
when the word nie ‘not’ /8™/ is used with a verb of one syllable (e.g. nie wiem
‘I do not know’ /B8™vj™m/, nie masz ‘you do not have’ /B8™mat/);
q
when a monosyllabic preposition is used with a monosyllabic pronoun (e.g. do
niej ‘to her’ /Bdc 8™j/, o tym ‘about it’ /Bc trm/, o czym? ‘about what?’ /Bc ttrm/);
q
in certain frequently used phrases (e.g. na czczo ‘on an empty stomach’ /Bna ttttc/,
na wsi ‘in the country’ /Bna fni/, na dós ‘downstairs’ /Bna duw/).
Although there is some controversy over whether Polish can truly be considered
a syllable-timed language, its rhythm is clearly very different from the obvious 
stress-timing of English. Unlike English (see p. 129), Polish vowels in unstressed 
syllables have little variation in length (they’re always short), little obvious centralisa-
tion, and no reduction to [e].

INTRODUCTION
This section aims at placing the study of speech science in a wider linguistic and social
setting by providing you with readings from scholars who are experts in various ﬁelds
of phonetics and linguistics. Note that books and articles quoted here can be found

RP – R.I.P.?
David Abercrombie (reprinted from Fifty Years in Phonetics (1991), Edinburgh: Edinburgh
University Press, pp. 48–53)
In this extract, written at the end of the twentieth century, David Abercrombie (1909–92)
discusses the changing status of traditional Received Pronunciation, making gloomy 
predictions for its future prospects. Much of what he forecast seems to be coming true!
RP today: its position and prospects
It is about thirty-ﬁve years since I last published anything on RP. The reason for
this long gap in talking about such an interesting and controversial subject is that
I have been away from England, except for occasional visits, during the whole 
of that time. Of course, there are many opportunities of hearing English people
talk on the radio and on television, and I have been teaching at a university –
Edinburgh – which attracts many English students. So I am able to say something
about phonetic and phonological trends in present-day RP. My chief interest in
the accent, though, has always been sociolinguistic, and it is more difﬁcult to 
discover what is happening in the ﬁeld from outside England. But let us ﬁrst look
at the phonetic/phonological aspects.
Naturally I do not believe RP has been phonetically stable since Daniel Jones
described it sixty-ﬁve years ago; no-one would expect it to be. No accent or dialect
remains static; linguistic change is always at work. I am sure, moreover, that RP
has never been as homogeneous as Daniel Jones made it appear. It has always
been subject to variations which are personal and idiosyncratic, and this apparently
to a much greater extent than other accents of England. RP is therefore difﬁcult, if
not impossible, to deﬁne phonetically (though there is one feature always present
– the extensive use of ‘creaky voice’). In other words, it is not phoneticians who
say who is an RP speaker and who is not; it is socially deﬁned. My own deﬁnition
(which some ﬁnd irritating) of an RP speaker is ‘someone who is recognised to
be so by other RP speakers’.
It is difﬁcult to ﬁnd any phonetic variations becoming predominant. One 
may venture to suggest, however, some phonological trends which it seems may
prevail. Most conspicuous of these, though it is not very common, is the replace-
ment of the diphthong in, for example, mouse by the diphthong in, for example,
mice. I have seen an RP-speaking character in a comic strip in a newspaper 
represented as saying ‘ight of the hice’ for ‘out of the house’. The falling 
together of the two diphthongs does not seem to be known in any other accent
of England. I know of only one regular broadcaster who does this, but it may be

heard in the speech of certain members of the Royal Family. Other prevalent
phonological developments are: the almost universality of ‘intrusive’ rs, as in idea-
r-of, law-r-and-order, though it is as much reprobated as ever; the disappearance 
of [uo] and its replacement by [nv], as in poor, sure, during; and the replacement
of [ou] by [m] in many words, for example in goal. I have heard ﬂoating and 
ﬂirting confused. All of these have been present in the speech of some RP 
speakers for many years.
These observations are based largely on listening to speech on radio and tele-
vision. Radio broadcasts, and much of television, are put out by the BBC, and at
this point a digression on RP and the BBC might be in order. It has popularly
been supposed that the BBC used to demand of its announcers that they speak
RP, whose use the BBC promoted. ‘BBC English’ has often been used as a syn-
onym for RP. All BBC announcers did speak RP, it is true, but in fact that was
an accidental by-product of another policy: that BBC employees – administrators
as well as announcers – should be of good social position, with appropriate inter-
ests and tastes. The BBC had an ofﬁcial whose business it was, by interview, to
ensure this (he was a high-ranking ex-naval ofﬁcer). The question of accent never
arose; all suitable applicants naturally spoke RP. It is interesting, by the way, that
Sir John, later Lord, Reith, the head of the BBC, did not speak RP (he was a
Scot). There was an Advisory Committee on Spoken English to the BBC; not 
all of its members were RP speakers. So it is difﬁcult to make a case for the BBC
deliberately promoting RP.
With this digression we can leave the phonetic-phonological aspects of RP,
and turn to the sociolinguistic ﬁeld.
Sociolinguistically speaking, RP is a very remarkable accent. It seems, in fact,
to be unique; I do not know of any accent like it anywhere else in the world.
There are, of course, accents of great prestige in many countries. These are all
regional accents, however; whereas RP is non-regional. It extends over the whole
of England, although only a minority of educated people speak it. But it gives this
minority privilege and power in many walks of life.
How does such a non-regional accent come to exist? An accent community is
normally geographically based. What can a non-regional accent be based on?
Just as RP is a unique accent, a unique institution provides its basis. This 
institution is the English public school, curiously named because it is anything but
public: it is extremely private. There are a number of these schools. They are
boarding schools, attended by pupils from thirteen to eighteen or nineteen years
of age who, while at school, are isolated from their surroundings, though they
meet pupils of other public schools when playing against them at various sports.
These schools are very expensive. RP is never explicitly taught in them, but it is
acquired effortlessly from one’s fellow pupils, most of whom will anyway already
have learnt RP from their families at home.
If children come from a non-RP-speaking family but their parents can afford
the expense, and consider it worth it, these children will still join the RP-speaking
community, even though their parents remain outside it.
The converse, incidentally, is also true. Some parents who are RP 
speakers may prefer, for various reasons, not to send their children to a public
David
Abercrombie

E X T E N S I O N
school; the children nevertheless will speak RP, and so will belong to the accent
community.
From this brief survey of the sociolinguistic background of RP, the crucial fact
about it cannot fail to emerge: it is a blatantly undemocratic institution. It is the
status symbol of an elite, an aristocracy neither of merit nor of birth, but one
whose power is fortuitously arrived at. People are evaluated, not according to
their achievements and abilities, but according to their accent.
I have elsewhere claimed that in fact there is in England an ‘accent bar’, on
one side of which are the RP speakers and on the other side the non-RP speakers.
I coined the term on the model of the ‘colour bar’ which is, or has been, found in
some societies, and to which an accent bar is in many ways analogous (though of
course a colour bar is a much more serious matter). One respect in which they are
different is that a colour bar usually has the majority of people on the ‘right’ side of
the bar, whereas the accent bar has only a small minority on the ‘right’ side.
The consequences of the accent bar can be very varied. For example, the poet
Tony Harrison recounts how, when he was a schoolboy (not at a public school),
he was jeered at in class by his English teacher for reading poetry aloud in a 
local accent instead of in RP. Yet nowadays, with an unchanged local accent, he
is considered to be an admirable radio broadcaster of his own poems. In one of
his poems he writes ‘RIP RP’, which aptly sums up the outcome of the accent
bar as far as he is concerned (and incidentally shows how the term ‘RP’ has spread
in recent times).
I read in the press recently of a judge’s decision concerning the future of a
young girl, which provides another example. As the consequence of a divorce, the
girl had gone to live with her father, while her brother and sister lived with the
mother. The father sent the girl to an expensive school, the result being that she
became an RP speaker. Her brother and sister continued to speak with their local
accents. The judge, asked to decide on the girl’s future, said he accepted that the
girl now spoke ‘posh’ and had moved into a different social class. (‘Speaking “posh”’
is a popular expression for speaking RP.) She should therefore stay with her father
so as not to have to mix with speakers of a socially inferior accent. The accent
bar thus ran through the middle of a family.
RP is a much disliked accent in many parts of the world, particularly in Scotland
and America. I am an RP speaker, so I speak from experience. It is disliked, as
well as envied, by many people in England also. This dislike is becoming more 
common, and also more outspoken. There are signs that RP’s prestige, privileges,
and power are being eroded. One ought really to live in England to observe in detail
changes which may be taking place, and I do not do so, as I have said; I live in
Scotland. Still, much can be gleaned from television and the radio, on which many
regular speakers – news readers, presenters, commentators, foreign correspondents,
meteorologists – do not nowadays speak RP. In addition to local accents of England,
many Scots and Irish accents can also be heard. A large number nowadays are
women, moreover. So the public have become quite used to the absence of what
used to be thought a necessity for an authority: a male, RP-speaking, voice.
The authority of prominent people in public life, such as Prime Ministers, has
traditionally been associated with RP. Prime Ministers [in the twentieth] cen-
tury, whatever their political party, unless they are not English (Lloyd George was
David
Abercrombie

R P  –  R . I . P . ?
249
Welsh and Ramsay MacDonald was Scottish), have until recently always been 
RP speakers. We have just seen, however, three successive Prime Ministers who
spoke with English regional accents: Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, and Edward
Heath. We have now an RP-speaking Prime Minister again in Mrs Thatcher, but
if her successor were not, it would occasion no surprise. The tradition has been
broken.
Perhaps the most interesting developments are that some speakers of RP seem
themselves to be turning against it; and that some young people have elected to
speak with a local accent, even though their parents are RP speakers.
Signs of these developments are perceptible even to someone, like myself, 
living outside England. I have had, for example, at the University of Edinburgh,
students from England whose background would lead one to expect them to be
RP speakers, but who seem to be deliberately trying to modify their accent by
adopting features of other accents, Scots for instance.
I am visited quite often by a number of young relatives of mine – two 
different families – who were brought up in London by parents one of whom was
an RP speaker and whom in the past children would almost certainly have chosen
to copy. In both families they have chosen to adopt a local London accent instead.
Doubtless the choice was not consciously made; but it seems to reﬂect a prevailing
climate of opinion.
One would really need to be on the spot to assess accurately how general these
trends are. It would appear that not much hope can be expected from phoneticians,
who seem not very concerned about possible changes in public attitudes to RP
and its speakers. Many phoneticians nowadays, moreover, including the most pro-
ductive and original, are themselves not RP speakers, which may be why they seem
indifferent to problems which do not concern them personally.
There are an enormous number of people, all over the world, being taught
English, and teaching requires a pronunciation model for the learner to emulate.
English offers a wide choice of accents suitable as models, more perhaps than most
other languages. One of these accents, of course, is RP. It is a very natural, not
to say inevitable, choice of model for learners in Europe, and perhaps further
aﬁeld. Its reputation as a prestige accent is widespread among educators, even if
its ambiguous position is not fully realised. The teacher, moreover, has available
a large number of pedagogical aids to its use, such as pronouncing dictionaries,
disk and tape illustrative recordings, phonetic texts, treatments of special aspects
such as intonation, and so on.
Nevertheless, RP has disadvantages as a model. It has a larger vowel system,
with many diphthongs, than most accents of English; this can be a teaching problem.
It has great prestige in some places, but it arouses hostility or dislike in others.
In some parts of the English-speaking world it is not found very intelligible. These
points have to be set against its advantages as a model.
RP is probably one of the most widely used models in the English-teaching world,
the other being what is usually known as General American, which is really the accent
of the Midwest. Although many Europeans mix more with Americans than with British,
no one has advocated General American as a model for Europe; indeed there is
a widespread feeling that there is something undesirable about an American accent,
which is a very old-fashioned attitude. In fact it is a very good model.
David
Abercrombie

Another possible model would be a Scottish accent. It is admired everywhere,
is highly intelligible, and phonetically offers a minimum of problems. If provided
with pedagogical aids, it would provide an excellent model. But that is another
story.
Another possible model would be based on the learners’ own mother tongue.
Such a model has already appeared in India, Egypt, and West Africa, as I have
seen for myself. The advocacy of such a model has been called by an American
writer ‘the British heresy’. A French expert on language teaching has recently put
forward such a model for French learners of English, and presumably this would
apply to other European languages. But that, too, is another story.
The position and prospects of RP today, then, it seems to me are not very
bright. If I may venture a prophecy, RP is slowly but surely on its way out.
Questions, suggestions and issues to consider
1
From your observations, or perhaps even your personal experience, would you
agree that the status of traditional RP has changed in recent years? What evidence
is there for or against? If you think change has taken place, do you think it’s stopped,
or is it still going on?
2
Abercrombie comments on the speech of British prime ministers up to Margaret
Thatcher. What can you say about the speech of those who have followed her (John
Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron)?
3
Some people are noted for having changed their speech from traditional RP (or
something very close to it) to a regional accent variety. Three examples commonly
mentioned are the late radio personality John Peel, the rock star Mick Jagger and
the classical violinist Nigel Kennedy. What do you think might be their various
motivations in making this change?
4
What kind of English accent would you yourself recommend as a pronunciation
model to foreign learners of English? Would your answer vary depending on 
what part of the world they lived in? Re-read Section A1 in the light of what
Abercrombie suggests.
5
An idea is presently current which takes up Abercrombie’s suggestion of 
basing a learner’s pronunciation model on his/her own language (see Jenkins 
2000 for the best known presentation of this type of argument). What would 
be the advantages to such an approach? Could you foresee any possible 
disadvantages?
ATTITUDES TO ACCENTS

251
Daniel Jones (1881–1967) is generally considered to be the greatest British phonetician
of the twentieth century and the man who laid the foundations worldwide for phonetics
as we know it today. Although one of his important contributions was his detailed
description of English pronunciation on the basis of traditional RP, he was perhaps the
ﬁrst linguist to set down clearly his opposition to prescriptivism in speech training and to
advocate respect for native accents of all kinds.
Aim and methods of phonetics
The aim of the phonetician is twofold: (1) to determine with precision the 
movements made by the tongue and other parts of the organs of speech in pro-
nouncing words and sentences, (2) to cause his pupils to perform unaccustomed
movements with their organs of speech; in other words, to pronounce new sounds
or new combinations of sounds.
The processes of phonetics can be applied in various ways. For instance, it is
possible by means of them to teach an apt pupil to pronounce a foreign language
in a manner almost indistinguishable from a native, whether that language is one
such as French, which has certain afﬁnities with English, or whether it is an 
absolutely remote one such as Chinese or Zulu. It is also possible to teach a pupil
to make changes in his pronunciation of his mother tongue; and it is this aspect
of phonetic work in which this [paper] is chieﬂy interested.
It should be explained here that phonetic work is not concerned with voice-
production. The phonetician is concerned with tongue articulations, etc.; we leave
the manner of producing the voice to those who are specialists in that subject.
These two branches of speech training should, in my view, be kept distinct; any
pronunciation can be combined with either good or bad voice-production. There are
plenty of people, for instance, who speak what is called ‘good’ English but use
bad voice-production. And conversely one not unfrequently hears good voice-
production combined with quite incorrect pronunciation; this may be observed
notably when good singers sing foreign songs.
‘Good’ and ‘bad’ pronunciation
Another point to be noted is that the phonetician concerns himself with the 
recording of facts, and his teaching is based on such records; he does not (or at
any rate it is better that he should not) concern himself with what is ‘good’ or
‘bad’ in pronunciation, or with what is ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ or with the ‘prettiness’
or ‘ugliness’ of sounds.
In fact, it is his function to take up a rather detached attitude in regard to
such questions. By doing so he ﬁnds that much of what is sometimes called 
‘beautiful’ or ‘ugly’ in speech is not intrinsic beauty or ugliness at all, but is
merely convention. The use of a certain sound recalls an unpleasant circumstance
or reminds us of somebody we do not like or whom we despise, and (often with-
out realizing the connexion) we attribute ugliness to the sound instead of to the
circumstances recalled by it.
To give an example: many people think it ugly to pronounce face as [fais].
But if you come to think of it there is nothing intrinsically ugly about this syl-
lable or about any parts of it; we use the vowel-sound [ai] in nice, twice, and ice
Daniel
Jones

252
E X T E N S I O N
without thinking it ugly, and the sound cannot become ugly simply because some-
one puts an f in front of it. In fact, I can imagine that if we are thinking of snow
and ice or skating, many people might consider the sound of the word ice rather
pretty. But if I were to make exactly the same sound [ais] in speaking of the 
‘[ais] of clubs,’ some of those people might regard that same sound as being ugly.
This instance shows that we are not dealing with intrinsic prettiness or ugliness:
the sound [ais] cannot vary its inherent prettiness according as a person uses it to
denote frozen water or a certain card in a pack.
The real reason why people who pronounce [feis] do not like the sound of
[fais] is that they connect the variant [fais] with Cockneys and slums and what 
they call ‘vulgarity,’ while they connect by a convention [feis] with gentility or
elegance or culture. (Incidentally, it may be remarked that [feis] and [fais] may
both be said with either good or bad voice-production.)
This detached attitude of merely regarding sounds as sounds (apart from any
inherent beauty they may possess, if any), of examining them as we ﬁnd them,
of analysing their mode of formation and noting who are the people who use
them, leads to very useful results. When we come to study pronunciation with
this attitude of mind, we make many interesting discoveries, some of which may
cause surprise. One discovery which the observer of phonetic phenomena makes
at quite an early stage of his studies is that he ﬁnds he actually uses a great many
pronunciations which at ﬁrst he might have been tempted to condemn. Another
is that when you listen carefully to the speech of those who condemn particular
forms of pronunciation, you will often hear them use the very pronunciations 
they are condemning. It is also interesting to ﬁnd out the effect which one’s 
own pronunciation has on different people; my pronunciation was, for instance,
once described by a teacher of some position as ‘the speech of costermongers and 
servant girls,’ and on another occasion by a provincial amateur philologist as a
‘nauseating London simper.’
We learn from such experiences to be very tolerant about other people’s pro-
nunciation; and that tolerance greatly facilitates the task of practical teaching. If
one is trying, for instance, to teach the sort of English I am now using to a class
of Cockney schoolboys, and if one is intolerant about their speech and tells them
that their way is ‘wrong’ or ‘bad’ or ‘ugly,’ it simply antagonizes them. They do
not like being told that the kind of English they have always used and which is
used by their parents, their brothers and sisters and friends, is ‘bad.’ But if the
teacher takes up a more tolerant attitude and explains that they have a language
which serves its purpose well for home use, but that there exist many other ways
of talking; that some of these ways are only understood well in restricted areas,
say London, or South Lancashire, or the neighbourhood of Dundee, while others
are readily understood over much wider areas – some, in fact, over the whole 
of the English-speaking world; that it often comes in very usefully if a man can
talk a kind of English which is easily understood everywhere, and that is why a
special kind of English is taught in school; then the teacher can get the boys on
his side, and they become willing to learn the school pronunciation instead of
thinking it silly and affected.

As to details of the methods of applying phonetics in the teaching of speech,
I could, of course, give many examples to show what can be done, but it is hardly
necessary to do so here, since most if not all of [us] are familiar with modern
methods of teaching pronunciation. But I should like to emphasize one thing, namely,
that phonetic methods deal not only with the articulations of consonants but also
with the more difﬁcult problem of the utterance of vowels. It is a relatively easy
thing to teach a child to say butter when his home pronunciation is to use what
we call the ‘glottal stop’ instead of the t, or to say getting when his home pro-
nunciation is gettin; and it is generally not difﬁcult (provided you can induce the
pupil to co-operate willingly) to cure lisping and other individual mispronuncia-
tions of consonants. But it is a good deal more difﬁcult, though none the less 
feasible, to teach the so-called ‘cultured’ pronunciation of face, tea, and two to pupils
accustomed to say [fais], [thoi], [thou]. Such things are mainly a matter of direct-
ing the pupils to put their tongues and lips into certain positions, and helping
them by suitable dictation exercises to discriminate by ear between different shades
of sound-quality.
Conclusions
Any pronunciation can be combined with either good or bad voice-production.
Much of what is sometimes called ‘beautiful’ or ‘ugly’ in speech is merely con-
vention. The beauty or ugliness applies to certain environments, and we are apt
to attribute beauty or ugliness to sounds which remind us of those environments.
A study of phonetics often reveals that we ourselves use pronunciations which
at ﬁrst sight we might be tempted to condemn. We thus learn to become very
tolerant of other people’s pronunciation; this tolerance on the part of a teacher
of speech makes him more efﬁcient.
Questions, suggestions and issues to consider
1
We have included this extract because it is one of the very ﬁrst examples of what
might be termed a liberal approach to social variation in speech. What do you
think might have been the reactions to this paper in the Britain of the 1930s? 
What might be the reactions in Britain today?
2
Are there nowadays any reasons for teaching children to change their natural speech?
Do Jones’s arguments that people should be encouraged to speak in a manner
which is widely intelligible still hold?
3
Would you agree that it is easier to change the pronunciation of consonants 
than that of vowels? Go back to Sections A5 and A6 for help in this discussion.
4
Do you consider that there are such things as ‘ugly’ or ‘pretty’ speech sounds?
Would you agree with Jones that ‘much of what is called “beautiful” or “ugly”
. . . is merely convention’? Or do you think aesthetic criteria can indeed be
applied to pronunciation?
5
From what you have learned of phonetics so far, do you ﬁnd that you actually
use pronunciations which at one time you might have been tempted to condemn?
If so, draw up a list. Talk to other members of the class and exchange your views
on this matter.

PRONUNCIATION WORRIES
David Crystal (reprinted from The English Language (1988), Harmondsworth: Penguin, 
pp. 57–61)
In this extract, the linguist, writer and broadcaster David Crystal discusses some of the
most frequent pronunciation complaints heard from BBC listeners. He points out that
what is often regarded as ‘sloppy’ speech is in fact characteristic of everyday usage for most
speakers. Crystal also provides a list of words which have alternative pronunciations in
British English.
[G]enerally actors try to pronounce words clearly, paying special attention to their
endings, and without rushing weak syllables. In this way, the words can be heard
more clearly at the back of the theatre. But their speech is much slower than 
normal conversation as a result. In three renditions of Hamlet’s ‘To be, or not to
be’ speech by different actors, the speeds ranged from 130 to 190 spm [syllables
per minute] – on average, half the speed of normal conversation.
The same point applies to other professional voice users, such as news broad-
casters, radio announcers, priests, judges, and politicians. These people all have
to speak in abnormal conditions – from a pulpit, in front of a crowd, into a
microphone. In most cases, the listeners cannot see the speaker’s face clearly enough
(or see it at all, in the case of radio) to enable them to get clues from the move-
ment of the lips, or from the facial expression, as to what is being said. To be
sure that their speech stands the best chance of being understood by all, then,
professional speakers know that they must speak relatively slowly and distinctly.
If they do not, they risk criticism of being unintelligible, or of being too informal,
casual, or ‘sloppy’.
Enter the radio listeners, for the most common of all complaints to the BBC
concerns the topic of pronunciation. And sloppy speech is the charge most often
cited. The irony, of course, is that in almost every case the words called sloppy
are in fact perfectly normal pronunciations in everyday speech, and everyone uses
them. They include such forms as Feb’ry for February, lib’ry for library, Antar’tic for
Antarctic, as’matic for asthmatic, twel’ths for twelfths, patien’s for patients, reco’nize for
recognize, and so on. It’s very difﬁcult in fact to say some of these words in their
‘full’ form – try pronouncing the second t in patients, for example. But many 
listeners, it seems, expect such precise articulation over the air, and are ready to
demand it in writing, to the tune of thousands of letters each year.
Most listeners give just one reason for their complaint: a letter is there in 
the spelling, and so it should be pronounced. This is another example of the wide-
spread belief that speech is a poor relation of writing. We always need to remind
ourselves that speech came ﬁrst, in the history of our species, and that we all
learn to speak before we learn to write. To be worried about our pronunciation
because it does not match the spelling is a strange reversal of priorities. We also
need to remember that pronunciation patterns have changed radically since the
days when the spelling system was laid down. English spelling hasn’t been a good
guide to pronunciation for hundreds of years.

But despite all this, many people do act very angry when sounds are left out
that they think ought to be there, or sounds are put in which they think ought not
to be. Probably the most famous case of this last point is the use of an ‘intrusive r’
by speakers of Received Pronunciation: the insertion of an /r/ between vowels,
when there is no r in the spelling. The most well-known instance, because of its
frequency in the news, is law and order – widely known as ‘Laura Norder’.
One listener sent in a collection of over 100 intrusive rs which he had heard
in one day’s listening. He included examples like Shah (r) of Persia, draw(r)ing, 
and awe(r)-inspiring. These are the noticeable ones, because the /r/ stands out
clearly after the ah/aw vowels, which are said with the mouth quite widely 
open. It’s much more difﬁcult to hear this kind of /r/ when it occurs after the
less sonorous /o/ vowel – the vowel that we use at the end of words like sofa
or Persia. Unless Received Pronunciation speakers are taking extreme care, and
speaking very self-consciously, they automatically put an /r/ into such phrases as
Africa(r) and Asia, an area(r) of disagreement, and drama(r) and music. I have a tape
recording of a critic vociferously condemning the intrusive r in law and order, in
the course of which he said ‘the idea of an intrusive r is obnoxious’, putting in
an /r/ at the end of idea!
Where does the intrusive r come from? It’s the result of these speakers un-
consciously extending a pattern already present in their accent, as found in the 
linking r sequence described above. It is important to notice that, although there
are thousands of English words which end in the letter r, only four kinds of vowel
are involved: /nv/ as in four, /pv/ as in car, /mv/ as in fur, and /o/ as in mother.
What has happened is that, over the years, the linking /r/ has been extended to
all words ending in one of these four vowels, when they’re followed by another
vowel. The effect is most noticeable in words ending in /nv/, as in law and order,
because there are in fact not very many such words in the language, so the usage
tends to stand out.
Of course, explaining why a pronunciation has developed doesn’t explain why
some people have come to hate it. It’s the same with other areas of usage. Why
do some people hate hopefully? The reason is likely to be something to do with
the way one social group, at some time in the past, adopted a usage in order to
keep themselves apart from another social group which did not. In particular, an
accent comes to be used like a badge, showing a person’s social identity. At any
one time, there are several pronunciation patterns which are ‘loaded’ in this way.
Current examples include ‘dropping the h’ (’ospital for hospital) and ‘dropping the
g’ (walkin’ for walking). These days such forms are considered to be uneducated
– though a century ago, they were often to be found in cultured speech (as in
the upper-class use of huntin’, shootin’ and ﬁshin’).
All of this presents radio managers with a problem, of course. Although only
a minority of listeners are antagonized by such matters, none the less they are
antagonized – and this is not what radio broadcasting is meant to be about. Announcers
and presenters who are sensitive to these issues therefore often go out of their
way to avoid using a pronunciation which they know will upset people. They may
go through their scripts and underline problem cases. Far more than the intrusive
r is involved, of course. The problems include changes in stress (e.g. dispute vs

dispute) and the pronunciation of individual words (e.g. saying recognize with or
without the g). A selection of issues is [given below]. Foreign words pose special
problems, as do the names of people and places. A Pronunciation Unit has long
been established at the BBC to help answer queries about such matters. During
the 1986 World Cup matches, the Unit had to issue guidelines to its commentators
about the players, referees, linesmen, managers, and others involved – it took
twenty-seven pages.

The problem becomes particularly acute if a radio channel decides to adopt 
a policy of friendliness or informality in response to listener demand. To make
speech come across in a normally informal way, it is necessary to speed it up,
and to introduce assimilations and elisions. If these are not introduced, either 
because they lessen the clarity of what is said or because they attract listener 
criticism, the speech will inevitably sound formal, clipped, and controlled. But 
listeners cannot have it both ways. If they want their announcers to sound 
friendly, they must expect a chatty style, with all the consequences that has for
pronunciation.
As long as society contains divisions, there will always be differences in pro-
nunciation, and, as a consequence, arguments about which form is best and which
accent is most acceptable. The arguments can be healthy and informative, or nasty
and intolerant. They are usually the latter. BBC announcers with accents other
than Received Pronunciation regularly receive hate mail. And when I present English
Now on Radio 4, my own accent – a mixture of Wales, Liverpool, and southern
England – is often criticized. The letter-writers usually ask for the removal, forth-
with, of the offending parties.
Getting the sack because of your speech isn’t unknown. I know of two cases
– one in an estate agent’s, the other in a hairdresser’s – where assistants have
had to leave because their accents were felt to be inappropriate. And in 1970
there was a much-publicized case of a blacksmith who committed suicide because
he could not cope with the ridicule levelled at his accent when he moved from
Yorkshire to the South of England. Remembering such stories, a tiny plea for 
tolerance would seem a reasonable way to end this section.
Questions, suggestions and issues to consider
1
Find further examples to support David Crystal’s rejection of the listeners’ claims
that ‘a letter is there in the spelling, and so it should be pronounced’.
2
Do you think you use intrusive r? If you think you do not, then is this because
you come from a region where rhotic English is spoken (e.g. Scotland, the West
Country, most of the USA)? Or are you a non-rhotic speaker who has made a
conscious effort to eliminate it from your speech?
3
Look at the list of 1980s controversies. Do you think your own pronunciation 
follows the 1981 BBC recommended (starred) form or not? Try saying each word
in both ways mentioned. Decide which of the two forms you think is more up 
to date (ask your parents or grandparents and see what they say). Do any of the
starred forms seem inappropriate or out of date to you?
4
At the moment (2008) British radio and television has newsreaders with
modiﬁed Scottish and Welsh accents on their national services. Is this in your 
view a good idea? Should it be extended and include, say, Geordie, Scouse 
or Birmingham? Or would you agree with the letter writers who ask for such
announcers to be sacked?
5
Have you any personal experience of problems relating to regional accents? 
Or do you know of anyone in your family, or amongst your friends, who has 
suffered because of his or her regional speech? Exchange your experiences with
others in the class.

TEACHING THE PRONUNCIATION OF A SECOND LANGUAGE
Peter Avery and Susan Ehrlich (reprinted from Teaching American English Pronunciation
(1992), Oxford: Oxford University Press, xiii–xvi)
Although this introduction to a pronunciation training course was written over twenty
years ago, it nevertheless deals with matters which are still under discussion today. Peter
Avery and Susan Ehrlich ﬁrst consider the ‘critical period hypothesis’, an idea borrowed
from biology, which suggests that in the course of human development there is a limited
window of opportunity for acquiring certain abilities. Originally applied in linguistics 
to ﬁrst language acquisition, it has long been disputed to what extent it can also be of 
relevance to learning a second language. After mentioning the part played by socio-
cultural factors and the student’s own personality, the authors go on to introduce con-
trastive analysis (though not employing the term) with respect to the ‘role of the native
language’ (cf. pp. 215–16 of this volume) and hint at the signiﬁcance of the phonetic/
phonological approaches which are detailed in their textbook. They conclude by stressing
the importance of ‘setting realistic goals’ – a matter which is the subject of much lively
debate at the present moment.
Preliminary considerations in the teaching of pronunciation
Let us begin by considering two opposing views on the teaching of pronunciation
in the ESL classroom. One view holds that the purpose of teaching pronunciation
is to eradicate all traces of a ‘foreign’ accent through pronunciation drills. The
other view holds that the teaching of pronunciation is futile after a certain age
due to a decreasing ability among learners to develop native-like pronunciation in
a second language. In this section, we will point out that neither of these views
is completely accurate by considering biological, socio-cultural, personality, and
linguistic factors which are known to affect the acquisition of the sound system of
a second language. This will lead to the understanding that while practice in pro-
nunciation may not make perfect, ignoring pronunciation totally can be a great
disservice to ESL students.
Biological factors
A common observation made by people involved in the ﬁeld of second language
learning is that adult second language learners almost always have a ‘foreign’ accent
while child second language learners almost always attain native-like pronunciation.
One hypothesis that has been proposed to explain this difference between adults
and children is the ‘critical period hypothesis’. This hypothesis holds that languages
are learned differently by children and adults, and that this is a direct result of
the maturation of the brain.
As all experienced ESL teachers know, adult learners do have difﬁculty in
acquiring native-like pronunciation in a second language. Thus, there may be some
truth to the critical period hypothesis. However, it is also true that some adult
learners do achieve native-like pronunciation and, among other adult learners, the
degree of pronunciation accuracy varies considerably from individual to individual.
The critical period hypothesis, therefore, does not absolve ESL teachers of the
responsibility of teaching pronunciation. The very fact that variability exists among
D4

Susan
Ehrlich

259
adult learners means that ESL classroom time can proﬁtably be devoted to improv-
ing students’ pronunciation.
Socio-cultural factors
The great variability in pronunciation accuracy of adult learners has led other researchers
to conclude that it is socio-cultural factors that largely determine this success or
lack of success in achieving native-like pronunciation. More speciﬁcally, it has been
claimed that the more strongly second language learners identify with members of
the second language culture, the more likely they are to ‘sound’ like members of that
culture. Conversely, if it is important for learners to preserve their own cultural
identity, they may hold on to their foreign accent as a marker of this identity.
We can see examples of this phenomenon in our own experience with native
speakers of English who speak a different dialect (British English, Jamaican English,
Australian English, etc.). Such speakers rarely lose their ‘accent’ primarily because
their accent serves as a strong marker of their social identity. This is especially
true when the accent is viewed positively by members of the society in which
they live. However, even when the particular accent is viewed negatively by mem-
bers of the culture at large, the accent may be retained because the speaker may
feel at a social distance from members of that culture.
For ESL teachers, it is important to be aware of the way in which these socio-
cultural factors may inﬂuence their students. Students may wish to improve their
pronunciation in order to make themselves more comprehensible but, at the same
time, they may not be interested in sounding like native-speakers of English. Such
considerations become important in setting realistic goals in the pronunciation class.
Personality factors
Other factors affecting the acquisition of the sound system of a second language
are related to the personality of the learner. Learners who are out-going, con-
ﬁdent, and willing to take risks probably have more opportunities to practise their
pronunciation of the second language simply because they are more often involved
in interactions with native speakers. Conversely, learners who are introverted, inhib-
ited, and unwilling to take risks lack opportunities for practice.
ESL teachers should be aware that such personality factors can affect progress
in a second language and should strive to create a non-threatening atmosphere in
their classrooms so that student participation is encouraged. Furthermore, students
should not be forced to participate if they are not ready, as the pressure to per-
form can be paralyzing for some students.
The role of the native language
The nature of a foreign accent is determined to a large extent by a learner’s native
language. Thus, speakers of English are able to recognize Spanish accents, Russian
accents, Chinese accents, etc. This is an indication that the sound patterns of the
native language are being transferred into the second language. Every language has
a different inventory of sounds, different rules for combining these sounds into
words, and different stress and intonation patterns. The pronunciation errors that
second language learners make are not just random attempts to produce unfamiliar
sounds. Rather, they reﬂect the sound inventory, rules of combination, and the
stress and intonation patterns of the native language.
Peter Avery
and 
Susan
Ehrlich 

260
E X T E N S I O N
The sound system of the native language can be seen to inﬂuence our stu-
dents’ pronunciation of English in at least three ways. First, difﬁculties may arise
when a learner encounters sounds in English that are not part of the sound inven-
tory of the learner’s native language. As we will show in the following sections,
the pronunciation of sounds depends on the proper use of the musculature in the
mouth. Thus, adult learners may be unable to produce new sounds because they
have never exercised their mouth in the particular way required to pronounce 
certain English sounds. Secondly, difﬁculties may arise because the rules for com-
bining sounds into words are different in the learner’s native language. This type
of difﬁculty can occur even when a particular sound is part of the inventory of
both English and the native language. Thirdly, the patterns of stress and intonation,
which determine the overall rhythm and melody of a language, can be transferred
from the native language into the second language.
The native language not only affects the ability to produce English sounds but
also the ability to hear English sounds. Experienced teachers certainly know the
frustration involved in having students continually repeat a mispronounced word
in the same way. Students may seem impervious to correction but, in fact, the
problem often arises because the word is heard through the sound system of the
native language. Thus, sounds which occur in the native language will be heard
rather than the actual sounds of English which are being produced by the teacher.
This highlights a very important point concerning the inﬂuence of the native lan-
guage. It is as if learners hear the second language through a ‘ﬁlter’, the ﬁlter
being the sound system of the native language.
One question that a teacher might ask concerns the degree of difﬁculty that
different native languages pose for learning the pronunciation of English. For exam-
ple, because the sound systems of English and Cantonese differ more than the
sound systems of English and Polish, is it more difﬁcult for a Cantonese speaker
to acquire English pronunciation than for a Polish speaker? If so, does this mean
that it is more important to teach pronunciation to Cantonese speakers than to
Polish speakers? The answer to both of these questions is ‘perhaps’. Cantonese
speakers’ pronunciation problems may cause their speech to be more incompre-
hensible than the speech of Polish learners. This, of course, would suggest that 
it is more important to teach pronunciation to Cantonese speakers. However, it
is not necessarily the case that their English will be more incomprehensible than
Polish speakers’ English. Socio-cultural and personality factors such as those dis-
cussed above will also determine the degree of a learner’s pronunciation problems.
In other words, the native language of a learner is not the only factor affecting
pronunciation ability in a second language. It is one of several factors, suggesting
that teachers cannot decide, without ﬁrst listening to their students, which learn-
ers will necessarily need more pronunciation practice.
Setting realistic goals
Given that biological, socio-cultural, and personality factors may prevent a student
from ever attaining native-like pronunciation in a second language, it is important that
teachers set realistic goals. Attempting to completely eradicate a foreign accent is
an unrealistic goal. However, this is not to say that pronunciation should be ignored

in the ESL classroom. We know that it is possible for adult learners to improve
their pronunciation. And sometimes these improvements can be quite dramatic.
What the teacher must focus on in the pronunciation class are critical errors,
features of a student’s speech most responsible for incomprehensibility. This requires
work in two areas. First, students must be made aware of aspects of their pro-
nunciation that result in other people being unable to understand them. Students
will not necessarily have this awareness before entering the classroom due to the
‘ﬁlter’ of their native language. In other words, they may not hear the points at
which their pronunciation does not correspond to that of a native-English speaker.
Secondly, students must be given the opportunity to practice aspects of the English
sound system which are crucial for their own improvement. It is important that
this be done in meaningful contexts as students often produce sounds correctly in
isolation but are unable to carry this over into their everyday speech.
Note
ESL: English as a second language.
Questions, suggestions and issues to consider
1
Looking back on your own experience of learning the pronunciation of a second
language, do you think the ‘critical period hypothesis’ applies in your case?
2
Think of other language learners you know. Are there any non-native adults who
sound almost like native speakers? If so, can you think of any special reasons there
might be for this?
3
Do you agree with the authors that some language learners may not wish to 
sound totally native? Are there any disadvantages to losing one’s foreign accent
completely?
4
Do you agree with the idea that extroverts (‘out-going, conﬁdent, and willing 
to take risks’) are better than introverts at learning the pronunciation of foreign
languages? If so, what strategies could a teacher adopt to assist introverted 
language students?
5
Go back to Section C1 (pp. 156–8), where we discussed systemic, distributional,
lexical and realisational variation between different native accents of English. To
what extent can we apply such categories to the errors made by non-native learners?
6
Of the types of error above, systemic errors are often thought of as being the most
signiﬁcant. Do you think this is always true?
7
At the moment a great deal of attention is being given to the idea of English as a
Lingua Franca (ELF) – namely a type of English intended primarily as a means
of communication between non-natives (Jenkins 2000). Amongst other things,
ELF involves reducing pronunciation training so as to deal only with the most
crucial problems from a non-native speaker point of view and ignoring the rest.
It has been implied, for example, that the English dental fricatives /0 q/ are ‘unteach-
able’ and that weak forms are insigniﬁcant. Argue for or against such an
approach to pronunciation training. Would it be wise to extend it to teaching 
pronunciation to both ELF learners and learners who are going to communicate
with native speakers? To what extent do you think that non-native learners of
English tend to have similar targets and ambitions?

PHONETICS APPLIED TO TEACHING THE DEAF
Dennis Fry (reprinted from Homo Loquens (1977), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 
pp. 139–43)
Dennis Fry (1907–83) was a phonetician who took a particular interest in the problems
of the deaf and in discovering the best ways to help people with speech and hearing 
problems. Here he pleads for the early diagnosis of profoundly deaf babies.
A severe loss of hearing, from whatever cause, will interfere with the natural and
spontaneous development of the capacity to speak and to take in speech, for it
will mean that the sounds of speech arriving at the baby’s ears will not be loud
enough to provide the basis for learning unless some special steps are taken. One
of the hazards of deafness is that the defect is not a visible one. Obvious abnor-
malities are readily recognized at birth or soon afterwards; even blindness reveals
itself at an early stage, but loss of hearing may be undetected for a long time and
this has serious consequences as far as the development of speech is concerned.
Mothers very often notice something strange in the early behaviour of a baby 
who is deaf, especially if they have already had a child with normal hearing. One
mother, for example, realized that her baby was deaf at the age of twenty-seven
days because it did not react in the way an elder sister had done, but usually it
takes much longer than this before anyone even suspects that a baby’s hearing is
not normal.
Discovering at the earliest possible moment if a child has a hearing loss is
vitally important for speech, for a number of reasons. For the ordinary person the
word ‘deaf’ tends to have an all-or-none character; if you are deaf you cannot
hear anything and if you are not, you can hear everything. The true state of affairs
is not this at all and this is why those who are professionally concerned in the
matter tend to talk more about hearing loss than about deafness. If you are 
sitting about three feet away from someone who is talking in an ordinary tone of
voice, the sounds are reaching you at a level of about 60 db.1 and they will be
loud enough for you to carry on a conversation quite comfortably. You might,
however, happen to be slightly deaf so that the sounds were considerably fainter,
let us say about as loud as if they reached you at a level of 40 db. In that case
your hearing loss for speech is 20 db. If you were much deafer than this, the
sounds of speech might be quite inaudible to you even at three feet and then your
hearing loss for speech is at least 60 db. and may be more. Deafness is therefore
a graded effect which can be measured in decibels and most commonly the degree
of hearing loss varies with frequency, that is to say a person may be particularly
deaf to high frequencies, to mid-frequencies or to low frequencies, or he may be
more or less equally deaf all over the frequency range. A baby who is born with
a hearing loss may have any degree of loss and in any part of the range. One 
fact that is not generally appreciated is that it is very rare indeed for a child to
be born without any capacity at all for perceiving sound; in practically every case,
if enough acoustic energy is supplied to the ears, the child will experience some
sensation of sound, if only within a narrow band of frequencies.

The sounds of speech as they leave the speaker’s lips will not provide enough
energy to be of use to a baby with a considerable hearing loss but this energy can
be magniﬁed and brought up to a useful level by means of ampliﬁers in the form
of hearing-aids. These devices may have a number of very sophisticated features
but their essential purpose is to magnify the intensity of any sounds which they
transmit and so to compensate as far as possible for a hearing loss. In order 
that speech may develop naturally in a deaf child it is important that suitable
ampliﬁcation should be provided during the ﬁrst year of life. It is an interesting
fact that while everyone understands the need for supplying prostheses2 to, say, 
a thalidomide baby3 at the earliest possible stage, it is very difﬁcult even for those
closely concerned to see the importance of ﬁtting hearing-aids to a deaf baby. 
The matter is of course bound up with the early detection of a hearing loss, which
must be ultimately the task of a suitable clinic, but once the presence of deafness
is established or even strongly suspected, it is perfectly possible for a baby of eight
or nine months to be equipped with hearing-aids.
The reason why this is so important will be clear from all that has been said
about the development of speech. It is a well-established fact that deaf babies 
babble just like hearing babies and the sounds they produce are not noticeably 
different. A critical moment comes, however, when in the ordinary way the sound
of adult speech would act as a trigger for the child’s babbling. Time after time 
it is reported by mothers that a deaf baby babbled up to a certain time and that
then the babbling faded; this is because the sound of other people’s speech is just
not audible or not audible enough to the baby to continue the normal process of
development. One thing that contributes to the breakdown is the fact that it is
just about this time that a child begins to crawl so that it tends to move farther
away from its mother. While it is in the mother’s arms or on her knee a good
deal of the time, her voice may be audible despite the baby’s hearing loss, but
when it becomes mobile, the added distance reduces the loudness of the voice.
The deaf child who is ﬁtted with hearing-aids continues to hear his mother’s speech
and there is a good chance that his progress will follow that of the hearing child
at this vital point. There are literally hundreds of children with a severe hearing
loss which has been discovered early who have acquired speech that is very little
different from that of hearing people. This is because the mother in each case has
realized the nature of the problem and has taken the necessary steps to see that
the child was continually hearing speech despite his deafness. In more than one
case this has been done in the early stages without any hearing-aids simply by 
the mother’s talking all the time right into the child’s ear. One of the most tragic
things that can happen, and it still does so all too frequently, is that the mother
is told either ‘We cannot be sure whether your child is deaf, so please bring him
back in two or three years’ time and then we may be able to tell you’ or else
‘I am sorry to tell you that your child is very deaf, so it will not be much good
trying to talk to him’. But the ﬁrst months and years are of vital consequence for
the acquiring of speech and language and the plain fact is that even a child with
perfectly normal hearing would not learn to talk if he did not hear speech all 
the time. A child with a hearing loss needs to hear speech much more than a
hearing child and not less; his mother needs to accompany every action and every

event with speech so that the baby’s brain may have the best chance of developing
for itself the immense store of information which we have seen to be necessary.
This is a tremendous task for any mother but if it is successfully accomplished, 
it is a very rewarding one since it reduces dramatically the handicap under which
the child labours for the rest of its life.
It is perhaps not easy to see how, even when these steps are taken, the child
can possibly work anything like normally with speech. His deafness not only makes
the sounds of speech faint or inaudible, it also distorts them because it changes the
relations of high, middle and low frequencies. Even with the best of hearing-aids,
the deaf ear cannot hear speech as the normal ear hears it. The clue is to be
found in the functioning of acoustic cues. Each individual brain evolves for itself a
system of cues which works for all the distinctions that have to be made. In doing
so it is in any case relying on the entirely private version of speech sounds which
the ears are relaying to the brain. There is no reason at all why English listeners
should all use the same acoustic cues and we can be pretty sure that they do not.
What is necessary is that, whatever cues they use in a given case, they should come
out with the right answer, that is to say they should recognize correctly what
phoneme is represented in the string. The deaf child can do exactly the same thing
provided he hears speech loud enough and often enough. His ears are supplying
him with different acoustic information and with less information than normal ears,
but his brain will use this to arrive at cues which work. Let us take the example
of the difference between /s/ and /e/ in English which for most of us depends
on a higher pitched and a lower pitched noise. To many deaf ears these actual
noises must be indistinguishable, but we noticed that the sounds are accompanied
by different formant transitions and these provide a cue which is available even
to most deaf ears, as long as speech is made audible. It is again the parallel of
the colour blind person who judges trafﬁc lights by their position and not by their
colour. Once the whole system is established, the deaf listener may have to rely
somewhat more heavily on redundancy4 than the normally hearing person, just 
as we do when there is distortion in the communication channel, and as far as
his own speech is concerned, he will like the rest of us apply his acoustic cues
to his own speech production, shaping his own sounds to the best of his ability
until they make a match with those he hears from other people.
None of this should be taken to mean that deafness of any degree is other
than a very grave disability when it is present at birth or very soon afterwards.
It is a fact, however, that if deafness is discovered early enough, if proper advice
is available and suitable hearing-aids are ﬁtted and if the parents, especially the
mother, are able to apply themselves to the arduous task involved, it is possible
to go a very long way towards overcoming the obstacle which deafness presents
to the normal acquisition of speech and language.

Questions, suggestions and issues to consider
1
What does Fry mean when he states that ‘for the ordinary person the word “deaf”
tends to have an all-or-none character’? What is the reality of the situation?
2
Discuss the signiﬁcance of ‘babbling’. See if you can get access to a recording 
of a young baby babbling – or, even better, try to make such a recording 
yourself.
3
Which sounds do you think partially deaf people will normally have most
difﬁculty with – vowels or consonants? Why?
4
If you know a person who uses a hearing aid, ask them (tactfully) to explain to you
how it improves their life. Try also to discover what they feel its limitations to be.
5
It may surprise you to discover that even by the age of twenty most people have
begun to lose the top frequency range of their hearing. Can you detect the high-
pitched squeaks made by bats? If you can, you can be pretty conﬁdent that you
have maintained good high-frequency hearing. Ask how many of the class are still
able to hear bat squeaks. If one can’t hear these high-frequency noises, do you
think this degree of hearing loss would impede one’s understanding of speech? If
not, why not?
MAKING COMPUTERS TALK
Peter Ladefoged (reprinted from Vowels and Consonants: An Introduction to the Sounds of
Language (2001), Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 68–73)
There are many problems involved in the process of making machines talk – in produ-
cing what is known technically as ‘synthetic speech’. In this extract, the eminent phonetician
Peter Ladefoged (1925–2006) summarises some of the difﬁculties and indicates how 
phoneticians and computer scientists attempt to solve them.
How writing must be pronounced
How do we get a computer to talk? My mother-in-law was nearly blind for many
years at the end of her life. What she needed was a way of turning anything that
could be written into good spoken English. She wanted to be able to put a book
in front of a computer, sit back, and enjoy it. (How the computer was going to
turn the pages was not her concern.)

Computers have been able to synthesize speech for many years [and] make
sounds like English sentences. But the quality of most synthetic speech is still not
high enough to make enjoyable listening. One might think that all we need are
the values of the formant1 frequencies and amplitudes,2 [etc.]. But there are many
steps in this process that are still not fully understood. So let us see why com-
puters don’t yet sound like you and me.
We want to have a system that will turn any kind of written text into syn-
thesized speech, forming what is called a Text-To-Speech (TTS) system. The ﬁrst
step in turning a text into speech is to ﬁnd all the abbreviations and symbols.
They have to be converted into their full forms. Abbreviations have to be distin-
guished so that the sentence ‘Dr. Smith lives at 10 Sunset Dr.’ is pronounced as
Doctor Smith lives at ten Sunset Drive, and ‘St. Paul’s church is on Church St.’ as
Saint Paul’s church is on Church Street. Symbols have to be interpreted so that ‘$14.22’
becomes Fourteen dollars and twenty-two cents, and ‘£1.40’ becomes One pound forty.
Most good TTS systems can deal with all these examples.
We also have to deal with acronyms, spelling out ‘TTS’ as text to speech and
turning ‘HE’ into His Excellency or high explosive, whichever seems more suitable
in the context. Some acronyms are normally not spelled out, but are pronounced
just as a sequence of letters (like USA or UK). Others are pronounced as if they
were words (like UNESCO). New acronyms (like TTS) are continually being devised,
making this a difﬁcult problem.
Numbers are pronounced in several different ways. Think how you would say
The year 1999 as compared with 1999 cars. If you are talking about the year it
has to be nineteen ninety nine or nineteen hundred and ninety nine, but the number
of cars could be one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine. Telephone numbers are
pronounced in different ways in different countries. Americans might pronounce
404 5911 as Four zero four, ﬁve nine one one, whereas British speakers might say
Four nought four, ﬁve nine double one.
Once we have a text that contains only words, we have to take the written
words and change them so that they are spelled phonetically. This may be quite
straightforward. A written sentence like ‘Black cats bring good luck’ becomes, 
in a phonetic transcription, blæk kæts br§¢ •ud l£k. Even if you don’t 
remember the phonetic symbols for the vowels, you can still see the relationship
between the letters and the phonetic symbols. But that was an easy sentence. 
We all know how difﬁcult it is to spell some English words. The computer has
similar difﬁculties in turning written English into a phonetic transcription. We 
will consider how it does this ﬁrst for consonants and then for vowels.
Consonants are fairly easy to deal with. Each letter often corresponds to a
phonetic symbol, as in the sentence ‘Black cats bring good luck’. In this sentence,
the only consonants that have to be changed from two letters into one symbol
are the ‘ck’ at the end of ‘black’ and ‘luck’ and the ‘ng’ at the end of ‘bring’.
A general rule changing ‘ng’ at the end of a word into the phonetic symbol ¢
will work very well. Another example of a combination of letters that has to be
regarded as a single sound is ‘sh’. The computer has to know that this is not 
a sequence of the sound s followed by h, but a single sound of the kind that 
we earlier called a fricative. It gets a little more complicated in the case of the
Peter
Ladefoged

M A K I N G  C O M P U T E R S  T A L K
267
letters ‘th’, which can stand for either the fricative in thin or the one in this, in
which the fricative noise is accompanied by vocal fold vibrations. A rough rule 
is that if the word is a noun, adjective, or adverb, then ‘th’ represents the voice-
less sound in thin, otherwise it represents a voiced sound, as in words such as
the, this, and that. Similarly, the computer has to have a general rule making 
‘ph’ into the phonetic symbol f in words such as photo and siphon. Of course all
the rules have problems and don’t always work. When the computer comes to
‘haphazard’ it has to know that this word is an exception to the rule, and is not
pronounced as if it were hafazard.
Vowels are a little more complex. When you were learning to read you 
had to deal with the problem of the silent ‘e’ at the ends of words. Each vowel 
letter can have at least two pronunciations. For example, the vowel ‘o’ is pro-
nounced as a so-called long vowel3 when it is followed by a silent ‘e’ as in note,
or when it is separated by a single consonant from another vowel in the same
word, as in notable. It has a so-called short vowel sound when there are two or
more consonants after it as in bottle, or when there is a single consonant and 
a word boundary after it, as in not. But these rules are far from foolproof. The
ﬁrst vowel in nothing has neither the sound of not nor that of note. We simply
have to regard this and many other words as exceptions to the rules. Computer
systems working only in terms of spelling rules with no exceptions soon get into
difﬁculties. They cannot deal with the six different pronunciations of ‘ough’ in
American English: tough, though, bought, bough, cough, through – to which the British
add a seventh: thorough, which has ™in the last syllable.
If we have a computer with a large enough memory, we do not have to bother
so much with spelling rules. We can store a large dictionary so that every word
can be changed into its phonetic form simply by looking it up. The only problem
with this form of synthesis is that it fails completely whenever it comes to a new
word that is not in its dictionary, such as the previously little-used name Clinton.
Most text-to-speech systems now rely on a mixed system, using a dictionary look-
up for many words, but having spelling rules available for new words.
Phonetic rules and dictionaries will not be enough in some cases. In the sen-
tence The dog’s lead was made of lead, only a very smart computer could tell that
the two forms of lead should be pronounced differently. A sophisticated speech
synthesizer could manage by understanding the sentence in much the same way as
we do. We know that the spelling ‘l e a d’ represents two different words. We
also know that dogs have leads, and that they can be made of metal. In this way
we know that the ﬁrst ‘lead’ refers to the one word, and the second to the other.
A human like you reading this page can appreciate the difference simply from the
information in the text. A sufﬁciently powerful computer could do the same.
But the main problem remains. Computers reading long passages nearly always
sound very machine-like because they can’t get the correct intonation. They don’t
know which words should be emphasized and how the different tunes should be
produced. They can handle simple sentences, and even use the punctuation to pro-
duce the intonation difference between ‘He likes cats – and dogs with long hair’,
and ‘He likes cats and dogs with long hair’. But other differences in phrasing are
more subtle. When we speak, we know where to put the emphasis because we
Peter
Ladefoged

268
E X T E N S I O N
know the meaning and the grammatical structure of different sentences. If I asked
you to name some liquids, you might say Water is a liquid, with the emphasis 
on Water. But if I asked you to name some properties of water, you might say
Water is a liquid, with the emphasis on liquid. It is simple for you to make these
differences. But computers have to learn a lot about language before they can
manage such subtleties.
Early speech synthesis systems could say simple sentences, and distinguish 
between statements and questions appropriately. Now they are able to produce 
a wider variety of intonations, and they are very good at conveying straight-
forward information. But they use smoother pitch changes without the small ups
and downs that occur in the real human intonation curves. Nor do they have the 
variety of intonations that any of us produce in everyday conversations. And when
it comes to reading anything dramatic, they fail hopelessly. It will be a long time
before a computer can give a good performance of Hamlet that my mother-in-law
would have enjoyed.
Words and sounds in sentences
In discussing the problems of synthesizing speech, we have so far skipped over
one point that deserves a section all to itself. When we talk we do not say each
word separately. There are no pauses between the words in a phrase. That’s why
there is virtually no difference between phrases like A name and An aim.
One result of running the words together is that the pronunciation shown in
the dictionary is seldom the way many common words are pronounced in a 
sentence. The end of one word will be changed because of the inﬂuence of the
following word. When you talk about a hand gun you may well pronounce it 
as something like hang gun, without the d being fully formed. If a hand gun ever
becomes an everyday item (what an awful thought) it will certainly be pronounced
as if it began with hang, just as has happened in the case of the familiar word
‘handkerchief’.
Combinations of words are continually changing so that they are easier to 
pronounce. Sometimes there are even semi-recognized spellings such as ‘gonna’
and ‘wanna’ for ‘going to’ and ‘want to’. But the effects of talking in a standard
colloquial style are not limited to just a few words. I’ve often heard a phrase like
‘this shop’ pronounced as thish shop, and ‘in play’ as im play.
Some people think that those who say things like this are not talking as 
precisely as they should. They consider such pronunciations to be sloppy speech. 
But this is something that everybody does. If you try to pronounce each word
separately and distinctly, you will sound most unnatural. When somebody tells
you that you should say going to instead of gonna, just tell them that you are 
talking more efﬁciently. You are conveying the same meaning with less effort.
Some speech synthesizers sound unnatural because they produce sentences that
are too stilted. They do not take sufﬁcient account of the way words run into
one another. Sometimes they also fail because they do not allow for the ways in
which many of the little words in speech become much abbreviated. When said
in isolation the words two and to are the same. But they differ in the sentences 
I have two ﬁsh and I have to ﬁsh. The same is true for but and butt in The goat will

Ladefoged

M A K I N G  C O M P U T E R S  T A L K
269
butt you, but it won’t hurt much. Nearly all the small grammatical words such as but,
and, for, to, from, a, the are pronounced in a very reduced form in conversational
speech. Speech synthesizers normally get most of these words right because they
typically use the reduced forms. Problems arise in the failure to use the full form
when it is required, as in a sentence like He went to and from London. In this 
sentence, the words to and from are pronounced in their full forms, and not in
the reduced forms that occur in a sentence such as He went to London from Paris.
Although there are no pauses between most words in a spoken phrase, the
white spaces between the words on a page certainly affect the way a phrase is
pronounced. We can all hear the difference between a stray tissue and a straight
issue, even though the sequence of phonetic symbols in a transcription is exactly
the same. This is because when a t occurs at the beginning of a word (as in 
tissue) it has a burst of noise followed by a short period during which the vocal
folds are not vibrating. During this period there is a semi-random noise centered
at the frequencies of the formants. At the end of a word there is usually no burst
of noise, and the clue to the presence of a t is in the vowel before it, and the
movements of the formants as the t is formed. In addition, a word such as straight
with a t at the end has a much shorter vowel than a word such as stray with no
ﬁnal consonant. We will return to this point below.
Similar differences are shown by the white spaces in the sentences I’m gonna
get my lamp repaired and I’m gonna get my lamb prepared. When a computer makes
a phonetic transcription of these two sentences, the sequence of sounds is the
same in both. But when you say them they are easily distinguishable. This is because
a p (like a t) has a burst of noise when it occurs at the beginning of a word such
as prepared, but not when it occurs at the end of lamp. The burst of noise may
be sufﬁcient to cover up much of the re in pre(pared). In each case the sound can
be transcribed as a p. But a speech synthesizer needs to know that it has to pro-
duce a different waveform for a p or a t when it occurs at the beginning of a
word as opposed to the end. In addition, as in the case of straight issue as com-
pared with stray tissue, it has to know that the sequence am in lamp is shorter than
the corresponding sequence in lamb.
There are differences between virtually all initial and ﬁnal consonants. Some-
times they are only small differences in length, as in the case of m in mum. When
this word is said in isolation, the ﬁnal m is much longer than the initial m. Sometimes
there are more distinct changes in quality, as in the case of l in leaf and feel. 
You can hear these differences more plainly when you listen to a recording played 
in reverse. You might expect leaf played backwards would sound like feel. But 
[in fact] it does not.
A number of other variants of sounds have to be taken into account in speech
synthesis (or, indeed, on any occasion when we require a full account of the way
a language is pronounced). Many sounds have different forms when they occur 
in different circumstances. For example, t is not only different when it occurs 
at the end as opposed to the beginning of a word. In American English it is very
different when it occurs within a word, before an unstressed vowel as in pretty or
better. In these words it sounds more like a very short d. In these circumstances
t is often called a voiced ﬂap4 – a sound in which the tongue tip ﬂaps very quickly

against the roof of the mouth, rather than making full contact as in the pronun-
ciation of word-initial t.
The sound t has at least one other variant that is important for high-quality
speech synthesis. In a word such as button it is replaced by a glottal stop in most
varieties of both British and American English. A glottal stop is the sound (or lack
of it) caused by bringing the vocal folds tightly together, cutting off all air from the
lungs. The phonetic symbol for a glottal stop is ¶, so button can be transcribed as
b£¶n. You make a glottal stop when you cough or hold your breath. British English
speakers (particularly those from big cities) tend to use glottal stops instead of t after
a vowel. Cockney speakers are well known for pronouncing butter as b£¶™.
Finally in this section, there is the matter of the length of each sound, which
we mentioned brieﬂy in comparing the words stray and straight, and lamb and lamp.
The length of a vowel depends on a number of things. Firstly, each vowel has its
own natural length; for example, the vowel i as in heed is longer than the vowel
§ as in hid. Next, there is the question of whether the vowel is stressed or not.
The ﬁrst vowel in personal is stressed and is longer than the corresponding vowel
in personify, which is unstressed. Third, vowel length depends on the number 
of syllables in a word. The vowel in wit is longer than the vowel in the ﬁrst 
syllable of witty, and this in turn is longer than the vowel in the ﬁrst syllable of
wittily. Fourth, the length is very much affected by the way the syllable ends. We
noted that the vowel in stray was longer than that in straight. The vowel in strayed
is intermediate between these two. Long, medium, and short vowel lengths occur
in sigh, side, sight, and in Ben, bend, bent. All these variations in vowel length can
be described in terms of rules that a synthesizer can use. There are also similar
complex rules governing consonant length that must be included in any high-
quality synthesis system.
Variations in vowel and consonant length affect the rhythm of a sentence.
Because speech synthesizers seldom pay sufﬁcient attention to the small adjust-
ments in length that are needed, they produce speech that is distinctly inhuman.
We have already noted how the failure to produce natural pitch changes makes
synthesized speech sound artiﬁcial. Mistakes in rhythm are equally responsible for
the unnatural quality of synthetic speech.

USING PHONETICS IN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS
Maurice Varney (originally entitled ‘Forensic linguistics’ (1997). Reprinted from English
Today 52, 13.4: 42–4, 46–7)
In recent years, linguists (and in particular phoneticians) have been greatly in demand
to assist in crime detection. Maurice Varney discusses the reasons for the increasing impor-
tance of forensic linguistics (as this branch of the science is called) and points out a few
of the difﬁculties sometimes encountered. In the original article, Varney discussed three
branches, namely handwriting; phonetics and phonology; discourse analysis, but in this
extract we have selected only the second of these.
Forensic phonetics: a new, varied and very practical application
of linguistic science
The term forensic linguistics, by analogy with forensic science and forensic medicine,
where scientists and pathologists use their skills in connection with problems involved
in both criminal and civil law cases, simply means that linguists act as expert 
witnesses in legal cases where some aspect of written and/or spoken language
seems to be signiﬁcant. Forensic linguistics, though its practitioners are still a small
and select group of experts, now stands equally as an accepted branch of lin-
guistics, alongside psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, etc., and also alongside its older
partners forensic medicine, forensic dentistry, forensic chemistry, etc. The speed
at which forensic linguistics has been accepted by lawyers, judges and juries is
somewhat surprising given that at least one of its branches, discourse analysis, is
often rather subjective. Perhaps it is because the application of forensic linguistic
techniques has led to swift and apparently reliable solutions to legal questions 
that the subject has acquired a respectable legitimacy which other branches of 
linguistics took decades to achieve.

There are three branches: handwriting; phonetics and phonology; and discourse
analysis. [ . . . ]
Phonetics and phonology
The expert in pronunciation and other features of speech appeared in literature and
folklore, long before the notion of forensic phonetics and phonology developed.
George Bernard Shaw, in 1912, in his play Pygmalion (later even more famous as
the musical My Fair Lady) satirises Professor Henry Higgins, an expert teacher and
student of speech. Higgins was almost certainly based on the phonetician Daniel
Jones, who established Received Pronunciation as the English pronunciation standard
for use by phoneticians and phonologists.
Jones and his immediate followers were primarily concerned with articulatory
phonetics, describing and cataloguing how human speech is produced. Today, the
main interest of most career phoneticians is acoustic phonetics, studying and inter-
preting the physics features of the sounds that human beings emit. Spectrographs
and other equipment are used to produce visual analysis of speech to a depth of
great sensitivity.
The notion of the ‘voiceprint’ has been put forward, analogous to that of
‘ﬁngerprints’. There is considerable evidence to suggest that no two people, living
or dead, will ever have the same acoustic features of voice and that, no matter
how well a person disguises the voice superﬁcially, sensitive equipment will be
able to show the base features of the original voice, and phoneticians will be able
to interpret these.
Voiceprint analysis is used in a great range of legal cases, including blackmail,
kidnapping, nuisance calls, confessions, telephone bomb threats, conspiracy, and
hoaxes. Of course, the spoken message needs to be recorded before it can be
examined and analysed, but this is often easy to do. Voiceprint comparison can
only be done if there is a bank of recorded voices similar to ﬁngerprint records.
Such banks are being built up from cases where the criminals are apprehended
and, as many perpetrators of crimes involving spoken messages reoffend, acoustic
features of voices are recognised in the same way as ﬁngerprints. An electronic
programme has now been developed called Forensic Speaker Identiﬁcation (SID)
which conducts a ‘voice line-up’ identity parade and acoustically compares the
voice patterns of suspects with that of the recorded message.
The Yorkshire Ripper case in northern England in the 1970s and 1980s involved
phonetic and phonological analysis in a dramatic way. After a series of murders
of women throughout Yorkshire, letters were sent to the detective in charge of
the case, mocking him and his investigation and purporting to be from the Ripper
himself. The letters were followed by a tape-recording, and it was conﬁrmed that
the handwriting of the letters and that on the parcel containing the tape were the
same.
The detective in charge was convinced that the tape was genuine, and he called
in specialists from the University of Leeds, the dialectologist Stanley Ellis and the
phonetician J. Windsor Lewis. They successfully and accurately identiﬁed the voice
and speech patterns as coming from County Durham, farther north than Yorkshire.

273
A village was pinpointed and the police investigation resources were turned to this
area, every man who lived there being interviewed.
Ellis and Windsor Lewis were right in identifying the geographical features of
the voice on the tape, but the tape was a hoax. The Ripper killed again and, when
he was eventually caught, he was found to come from South Yorkshire. The sender
of the hoax letters and tape was never found. The detectives and forensic linguists
in this case were viliﬁed and accused of making mistakes which cost more lives
and millions of pounds, but the criticism is unjust. In the circumstances of the
time, the linguistic evidence appeared genuine and the experts followed the only
road open to them.1
Apart from recognition of regional features and voiceprint acoustic features,
forensic phoneticians are often called on to make educated guesses about the back-
ground, age, education, etc., of the people whose voices they have on tape. This
is a tricky process involving much subjectivity, but the track record has been 
good, and experience and case studies enable practitioners to deduce much from
an anonymous voice. Linguistic background, possible profession, and even age can
be assessed and often checked by parallel analysis of the vocabulary and sentence
structure used.
All phonological features are considered by the forensic phonetician: pronuncia-
tion, intonation, stress, pace, etc. In one case, a New Yorker living in California
was arrested and indicted for making threatening calls to Pan American Airlines.
His defence attorneys called in a voiceprint expert and the dialect expert William
Labov, and together they proved the intonation of the anonymous caller was Bostonian
and not New York. The suspect was acquitted (Labov 1988: 170–81).
Note
1
An interesting follow-up to the Yorkshire Ripper case took place in 2005, nearly
thirty years after the murderer’s ﬁrst attack, when the hoaxer, John Humble, was
eventually tracked down through DNA analysis of a drop of saliva he had left on
a letter. It turned out that the phoneticians Ellis and Windsor Lewis had indeed
traced him to within a very short distance of his home. In 2006, Humble con-
fessed to his guilt, and was sent to prison for eight years.
Questions, suggestions and issues to consider
1
Find a copy of Pygmalion and read through those scenes where the legendary pho-
netic powers of Professor Higgins are portrayed. Are his talents in any way believable?
2
Do you yourself know from radio, television or newspaper reports of recent cases
where forensic linguistics has had a role to play in solving a crime? Discuss these
in class.
3
Some linguists disapprove of forensic phonetics on principle, believing that it is
wrong for practitioners of an academic discipline to meddle with criminals and
the law. Would you agree with that point of view?
4
Do you think it is realistic to expect linguists to deduce not only regional char-
acteristics of speech but also features such as ‘background, age and education’?
What do you think might be the problems involved?

Make some recordings (either live or from the radio or TV) and play them to a
group of classmates and/or friends. Ask them to judge such matters as regional
accent, age, education, profession, etc. See if a knowledge of phonetics (no matter
how slight) aids people in making their ‘educated guesses’.
THE RISE OF ‘UPSPEAK’
Barbara Bradford (originally entitled ‘Upspeak in British English’ (1997). Reprinted from English
Today 51, 13.3: 33–6)
In this extract, Barbara Bradford discusses the nature and possible origins of an intona-
tion pattern which appears to be increasingly common in the speech of many native English
speakers, especially those of the younger generation. What she terms ‘upspeak’ has
attracted much comment in recent years – not all of it favourable.
Upspeak in British English
An examination of a novel UK rising tone, with reference to its use in some other Anglophone
countries
This article reports on a small-scale study of the use of a particular intonational
feature, sometimes referred to as ‘upspeak’, by speakers of British English. The
term upspeak is used here to refer to the use of a rising tone in the ﬁnal tone
unit of a declarative clause where in RP a falling tone would be used. Its use
seems to extend across geographical areas, social classes, the gender boundary and,
to some extent, chronological boundaries, although it occurs most commonly in
the conversations of those in their upper teens, twenties and thirties.
The article is based on observations of the occurrence of upspeak among British
speakers in the mid-1990s and refers to speech data of a group of female RP
speakers in their late teens and early twenties. The article suggests that upspeak
has two main communicative functions and focuses on the interpersonal and situa-
tional factors which predispose speakers to use it.
Similar phenomena to upspeak have been documented in other areas of the
English-speaking world in the last 35 years: New Zealand, Australia, Canada and
the USA: see Britain (1992) on the occurrence of High Rising Terminal contours
in New Zealand English, and references therein to research in other geographical
areas. The present study provides independent conﬁrmation of the existence and
diffusion of this intonational feature in British English.
. . . The use of a ﬁnal rising tone where a falling tone would be expected in
RP is an established and well documented prosodic1 feature not only of upspeak
but also of non-standard accents in some regions of Britain, e.g. in Wales and
Northern Ireland and in the English cities of Bristol, Liverpool, and Newcastle,

and the county of Norfolk. It is also characteristic of regional accents in other 
traditional English-speaking countries, as well as Caribbean, Indian and some other
varieties of English. (See Cruttenden, 1986, p. 137 ff.) What is important here
is that the distribution of the rises is more systematic in regional and varietal accents
of English than it is in upspeak. The upspeak rule is applied non-systematically, i.e.
upspeakers do not convert all RP falling tones to rising tones, even where the
structural conditions for the operation of the rule are fulﬁlled.
An explanation frequently offered for any change in language use is that young
people are inﬂuenced in their way of speaking, particularly in interaction with
their peer group, by the accents of role-model characters in ﬁlms, advertisements
and television programmes made in Australia, USA and dialectal areas of the UK.
In the case of the appearance of upspeak, the Australian soap operas ‘Home and
Away’ and ‘Neighbours’ and the Merseyside soap ‘Brookside’ are suggested as the
initiators, since both Australian and Liverpool accents are perceived as demon-
strating frequent rising tones. Such inﬂuences cannot be totally ruled out as it is
likely that many of those in the age group now using upspeak will have watched
these soaps. It is suggested here, however, that if it is the case that Australian
soap operas have played a part in the initiation of upspeak in British English, it 
is because British youngsters have viewed characters in the programmes using the
equivalent of upspeak in Australian English. What could have been spread in this
way would, therefore, not be an aspect of General Australian pronunciation as
such, but an international feature of the intonation of young people.
However, there are at least two counterarguments to this TV inﬂuence theory.
Firstly, the fact that from the full set of phonetic features which make up 
any regional accent only the steep ﬁnal rises in pitch have been adopted by the 
upspeakers is problematical. The main difference between the Australian accent
and RP is the vowel sounds and so one might have expected to detect evidence
of, at least, some vocalic adaptations. Secondly, I have personal experience of 
a 23 year old who is not a current viewer of any of the TV programmes which
have been blamed for the use of upspeak but who started to use it in 1996 after
returning from four months living and working abroad with a group of young
British people. The key point here, though, is that she watched both of the Australian
soaps avidly during her teenage years but neither she nor her peers used upspeak
at that time. None of this is conclusive evidence to disprove the Australian soap
inﬂuence theory, but it does suggest that an investigation of interpersonal and social
factors may yield more productive ﬁndings.
Discourse intonation
A description of intonation which in sociolinguistic terms identiﬁes and character-
izes the meaning contrasts conveyed by intonation features was developed in the
1970s from original work being done in discourse analysis (Coulthard, 1977). Previous
approaches had described intonation in terms of a range of attitudinal signiﬁcances
(O’Connor & Arnold, 1973) or in terms of grammar (Halliday, 1967). The theory
of discourse intonation (Brazil, Coulthard & Johns, 1980; Brazil, 1985) describes the
forms and functions of English intonation in terms of the discourse context and
with reference to the social setting. It describes and explains the communicative

value of intonation by focusing on the decisions a speaker makes at each point in
the developing conversation. These are subconscious decisions about prominent
syllables, tone and pitch levels.
According to this model, tones (i.e., major pitch movements) can, in simple
terms, be divided into two categories: those which ﬁnally fall (fall and rise-fall),
classiﬁed as proclaiming, and those which ﬁnally rise (rise and fall-rise), classiﬁed as
referring. The two types of tone can be seen to relate to a contrast in meaning.
In general terms, the rising tone can be said to be used by a speaker for that part
of an utterance which s/he perceives or presents as existing common ground between
him/herself and the hearer(s) at that point in the conversation, whereas the falling
tone is used for that part of an utterance which the speaker perceives or presents as
new to the hearer(s). The speaker’s perspective on an idea, whether it is an idea
already in play or whether it is a new contribution to the developing conversa-
tion will determine tone choice. This short sentence: ‘I’m going to the theatre
on Saturday’, illustrates the meaning contrast of the ﬁnally falling and ﬁnally rising
tones:
(i) // 7 I’m going to the THEatre//8 on SATurday//
or
(ii) //8 I’m going to the THEatre// 7 on SATurday //
(after Bradford, 1988)
In (i) the fall-rise tone comes in the tone unit containing Saturday which signiﬁes that
Saturday is discourse-old at this point in the conversation, so this sentence would be
a suitable response to ‘Would you like to go out to dinner on Saturday?’ The falling
tone is used for the part of the utterance which contains ‘new’ information for
the hearer, i.e. going to the theatre. In (ii) the fall-rise tone comes in the tone unit
containing going to the theatre which signiﬁes that this is information already activated
at that point in the conversation so this sentence would be a suitable response to
‘Would you like to go to the theatre on Friday?’ The falling tone is used for the part
of the utterance which contains the ‘new’ information for the hearer, i.e. on Saturday.
From this we can see that tone functions in discourse as a means by which
participants indicate how they perceive the status of the information they are con-
veying in relation to the state of convergence between themselves. The ﬁnally-rising
tone functions to increase the area of convergence and to lessen the conversational
distance between them.
Affective and referential functions of upspeak
Upspeak is an intonational device used by speakers for two main communicative
purposes.
First, it has an affective2 dimension, acting as a bonding technique to promote
a sense of solidarity and empathy between speakers and hearers. (See also Britain,
1992, and references therein.) An upspeaker seeks to reduce the social distance
between him/herself and the hearer(s) by exploiting the rising tone, conventionally
reserved to convey the idea of common ground and shared experience, and uses
it as an intonational strategy to present hearer-new information and simultaneously

277
to project or expand the state of convergence between them. This exploitation of
the intonation system has the psycho-social effect of making the speaker sound less
assertive or authoritative.
Second, upspeak has an important referential component, acting as a means
of signalling salient chunks of information, and thus encouraging the hearer’s con-
tinued involvement in the discourse. By presenting ‘new’ information as if it were
part of ‘common ground’, a speaker indicates that the content of that part of the
discourse is perceived to be of intrinsic or assumed mutual interest.
In this way, the speaker is able to provide cognitive stepping stones in the
unfolding discourse to enable the hearer(s) to negotiate the stream of speech. This
‘directing to a focus of interest’ function may explain why upspeak occurs so 
frequently in narrative.
As a device for ensuring the hearer(s)’ continued involvement and interest in
the narrative, the use of upspeak may be similar in effect to the use of ﬁllers such
as ‘Right?’ or ‘You know what I mean?’, which are used by speakers to check
that their listeners are keeping abreast of the information ﬂow or are sympathetic
to what is being said. They are in use in many varieties of English; for example,
‘yeah?’ and ‘OK?’ are used in the USA and extensively elsewhere, Canadian English
speakers often add an ‘eh?’, and there is a tendency in South African English to
use ‘ya?’. Such ﬁllers are pronounced with a steeply rising pitch movement and
are located at the end of a falling-tone declarative, the declarative–ﬁller combina-
tion producing a fall-rise contour which terminates with a steep and high rise. This
leads us to conclude that the phonological form of upspeak, described earlier as
a fall-rise with a steep and usually high terminating rise, is the conﬂation of a
standard falling tone with the steep rise of a ﬁller of the ‘Right?’ kind. In this
way, the communicative force of the interrogative ﬁller is intonationally incorporated
into the declarative, making the ﬁller itself redundant and reducing syntactic 
complexity.
Social factors
Although upspeak in British English appears to cut across gender, the available 
evidence indicates that it is most prevalent among and ﬁrst displayed in the speech
of young females. It permeates the speech of young males only after becoming
well established among females. Assuming that upspeak can in part be explained
as an emotive bonding technique, this initial resistance on the part of males might
be construed as an exponent of the assertive masculine psyche with its inclination
to retain authority and control – in this instance by not exploiting upspeak to
reduce speaker–hearer distance. In contrast, the females’ inclination to use it can be
seen as a linguistic reﬂex of the female wish to appear approachable. It follows,
then, that if a female is in a position of higher status than her interlocutor(s), or
in a dominant role, but wishes her feminine identity to be taken into account,
she would be inclined to use an intonational device which increased the area of
convergence between them. One example of this affective function is the nurturing,
non-authoritative speech of mothers to very young children, where the use of 
rising intonation patterns is well documented (Garnica, 1977; Ogle & Maidment,
1993). Upspeak does become a feature of the speech of some males once it is
Barbara

278

well integrated among the females in a community. Males may consciously or 
subconsciously choose to use this intonational device in situations where they wish 
to appear non-assertive and when they wish their contributions to be perceived as
conciliatory rather than aggressive.
It appears that upspeakers are able to code-switch,3 using upspeak in one 
context but not in another, according to situational factors. Upspeak is initially a
peer group activity, creating a speech community among the young. Its use is rein-
forced by the acceptance it brings, signalling in-group solidarity, a wish both to
include and to be included. Speakers switch between their normal intonation and
upspeak, according to their perception of the setting, using upspeak in situations
where they sense or desire social cohesion and hearer empathy.
The fact that upspeak has an irritating impact on many people in Britain, par-
ticularly those of the older generation, may be caused, at least in part, by a mis-
judgement of the social situation on the part of the upspeaker and a misconstrual
of the upspeaker motivations on the part of the hearer(s). If a psychological signal
for social bonding is given by the speaker where a distance is required by the
hearer, it can be perceived as out of place and even disrespectful. The negative
reaction on the part of the hearer could also relate to confusion caused by the
incompatibility of a declarative statement containing an interrogative intonational
component. The fact that a young speaker may use upspeak for a length of time
when living or operating in one social context and then discontinue when in another
was stated earlier as a personal observation. This suggests that upspeak is transient
in nature, a phase through which some young people pass.
However, just as upspeak crosses the gender boundary once it has become
established in a community, it seems also to cross chronological boundaries. In the
USA and the Antipodes where it is well established it has spread through the age
groups and is no longer used exclusively by the young. The factors governing its
use can be seen not to be exclusively age-related, then, but to be motivated by
the social and interpersonal conditions of the speech situation.
Conclusion
Upspeak has been heralded by the British media as a recent aspect of language
change possibly triggered by the inﬂuence of Australian soap operas on teenage
viewers. It has been suggested here that it has been in existence in many parts of
the English-speaking world, including the United Kingdom, for at least 30 years.
Whether the geographically disparate occurrences of upspeak are totally inde-
pendent developments or the result of contact-induced spread is an open but 
interesting question. Either way, the communicative functions of upspeak can be
explained by reference to interpersonal factors and the convergence or divergence
of conversational distance, and its expansion seems to have been conditioned in
all cases by sociolinguistic determinants.

code-switch: the process of changing from one language or language variety to
another.
Questions, suggestions and issues to consider
1
Do you think you use upspeak yourself? Do your friends? Watch an American,
an Australian and an English soap and sample ﬁve minutes of dialogue from each.
Is there any difference in the frequency of occurrence of upspeak?
2
Do you think that your pronunciation is more like that of your parents, or more
like the speech of friends of your generation? Provide some examples to illustrate
your answer.
3
Listen to the samples of speech varieties on your CD. Can you hear examples of
upspeak in any of them? Do this as a class exercise and compare notes.
4
Another explanation suggested for language change is the inﬂuence of ﬁlms, advert-
isements and television programmes. What is your opinion on this? Can you think
of any linguistic features you may have copied from any of these sources? If 
you have taken over any features from television, is there any speciﬁc variety of
English which you are more likely to copy than another?
5
Upspeak is often said to be associated with narrative and, as Bradford points out,
with younger-generation female speech. Let’s see if these claims are true. Using a
small selection of informants (your classmates or friends), ask them to make a
3–5-minute audio recording describing an interesting experience which they have
had in the last six months. Listen to the recording and note instances of upspeak.
Is there any difference between men and women informants? Are the upspeakers
characterised by any other features (regional origins, social background, etc.)? If
you have the opportunity, record some members of the older generation in the
same way and see if any instances of upspeak occur with these informants.

J. C. Wells (part of a talk originally given to the Simpliﬁed Spelling Society (henceforth SSS),
and now made available in revised form (2003) on the author’s website, see below)
Apart from being the editor of the Longman Pronunciation Dictionary, John Wells 
(emeritus Professor of Phonetics at University College London) is perhaps best known for
having written the massive standard work on English pronunciation varieties Accents of
English (1982). He is also an enthusiastic advocate of spelling reform and is currently
President of the SSS. In this extract from a talk which he originally gave to that organis-
ation, Wells examines the need for a reformed alphabet to take account of the ways in
which pronunciation varies from one accent to another. The full version of this text can

Some basic problems
The alphabet
An ideal spelling system, we all know, will have one symbol for one sound, one
grapheme for one phoneme. But this principle throws up certain difﬁculties in
practice. If we conﬁne ourselves to consideration of the Latin alphabet, one major
difﬁculty is that it is an arbitrary list of 26 letters which do not necessarily cor-
respond to the sound systems of the languages which have to use it. In particu-
lar, they do not correspond to the sound system of English. On the one hand,
the Latin alphabet provides us with no unambiguous way of spelling English sounds
that Latin lacked (e.g. the sound we often spell sh, the two sounds we spell th,
and many of our vowels and diphthongs); on the other, it contains at least two
letters, q and x, that were unnecessary even from the point of view of Latin. In
this article, however, I am concerned not so much with the deﬁciencies of the
alphabet and how we might remedy them (the ‘grapheme’ part) as with the prob-
lems arising from the fact that we English speakers do not all pronounce our lan-
guage in the same way (the ‘phoneme’ part).
As my eminent predecessor Daniel Jones pointed out in his article about 
phonetics and spelling reform (1944),1
people in different parts of the country speak differently […;] what is a 
phonetic representation of a word for one person is not necessarily phonetic for
another.
In raising these problems I do not want to detract from the fact that there are
large numbers of words in our language where they do not arise. All speakers of
English, no matter where they come from, pronounce friend so that it rhymes
with bend, send, tend. So a reformed spelling frend ought to be uncontroversial.
Everyone pronounces sight, site and cite identically, so it is absurd (except for advo-
cates of etymological spelling) that we have to learn to spell them all differently.
Everyone distinguishes the verb to advise from the noun the advice, so we can see
the justiﬁcation for distinguishing them in spelling – yet we all make the same 
pronunciation difference between to use, to house, to excuse and the nouns the use,
the house, the excuse where we make no spelling distinction.
Danger of parochialism
The sounds of any language can be viewed as a system of contrasting phonemes.
The pronunciation of any word can be speciﬁed in terms of the string of phonemes
that represent it, together perhaps with information about relevant prosodic fea-
tures (in the case of English, about stress placement). In designing a scheme of
spelling reform, we face a certain danger of insularity or parochialism, of assum-
ing that everybody has the same set of phonemes, and uses the same phonemes
in particular words as we do ourselves. Unfortunately this is not the case. What
seems obvious and normal to one speaker may be exotic, unusual, subtle and
strange to another. There are all sorts of little facts about how English is pro-
nounced round the world by native speakers which may give us pause in our
reforming zeal. Here is a simple example. The traditional spelling of the words

Wells

ENGLISH ACCENTS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR SPELLING REFORM
281
any and many conﬂicts with the way most of us say them. It may seem obvious
to most of us that they rhyme with penny and so ought to be spelt in the same
way, perhaps as enny and menny. In making such an assumption, however, we
are ignoring the awkward fact that many southern Irish people pronounce them
to rhyme with nanny, so that they would see nothing strange about writing them
with the letter a. Maybe they would want to write anny and manny rather than
any and many, but that is not my point. I concede that in English as a whole
the preferences of the southern Irish may have to give way before those of 
the vast majority of other English speakers – but we should be aware of what our
proposals imply.
Consonant variations
Spelling the past tense
Ought mist and missed to be spelt identically because they are pronounced identi-
cally? Or should we give the past tense a consistent spelling shape with d, even
when, as in missed, it is pronounced /t/? In deciding this issue, we should per-
haps consider the Nigerians, who do not usually pronounce missed like mist. This
is because – under the inﬂuence of traditional orthography – they typically use a
/d/ sound in missed, and in fact usually assimilate the /s/ sound to a /z/, so say-
ing /mizd/, with voicing throughout. For them kicked, likewise, tends to rhyme
with rigged rather than with strict. I am not necessarily saying that we have to let
our reform proposals be determined by how Nigerians pronounce English, even
though they do constitute a substantial body of users of English. But I am saying
that we should at least be aware that a reform that makes spelling more logical
for one group of speakers may make it less logical for another.
Spell or omit r?
From New Spelling (Ripman and Archer, 1948)2 onwards the importance of catering
for accents other than Received Pronunciation has been clear from the treatment
of historical r. Like most English people, in my speech I don’t distinguish stork
and stalk. If spelling reform proposals do make a distinction, as they usually do,
then the reason is (a) historical and (b) because they are pronounced differently
from one another in other accents. Historically, stork had /r/, and stalk did not.
In many varieties of English (Scottish, Irish, west of England, most American,
Canadian – the rhotic accents) the distinction is still made in speech. Similarly 
pairs such as larva – lava, rotor – rota, homophonous for English people like me,
are distinct in the rhotic accents. This justiﬁes our keeping the distinction in spelling,
even though the task of learning which words to write with r and which without
will impose some burden on those of us whose English is non-rhotic. And those
of us who pronounce intrusive /r/, saying perhaps rotar of duties, will have to
remember not to write r in some positions where we pronounce it, as well as
sometimes writing it where we do not pronounce it. Faced with this problem,
spelling reform has little alternative to accommodating the rhotic speakers, even
if the consequence is that we non-rhotic speakers must learn by rote when to
write r and when not.
J. C. 
Wells

282
E X T E N S I O N
Singer and ﬁnger
A similar problem arises with ng. Consider the pair singer:ﬁnger. For most speak-
ers these words do not rhyme exactly, because ﬁnger has a /w/ sound after the
nasal. It seems logical to write singer but ﬁngger (Ripman 1941).3 The trouble
here is that people in the trapezium linking Birmingham–Manchester–Liverpool
make these words rhyme, with /w/ in both. So if we show a difference in spelling,
some Midlanders and Northerners will have to learn an extra arbitrary distinction.
Alternatively, I suggest, it is a distinction we might well decide to ignore – so
incidentally also simplifying the spelling of the comparative and superlative of long,
strong, young, whose irregular pronunciation in most accents would otherwise be
reﬂected in reformed spelling as longger, longgest etc.
Social factors
Accents as social labels
A complication with the northern pronunciation which merges the vowels of cut
and put is that it bears considerable sociolinguistic value. As everyone knows (in
England), the vowel sounds you use in the STRUT set tend to ﬂag your social class
and to symbolize educated versus uneducated speech. The same is true of many
other pronunciation variables. A reformed spelling that seems to buttress a low-
prestige pronunciation will encounter resistance.
Hypercorrection
Aware of social prejudice, northerners not uncommonly attempt to use a south-
ern- or RP-style vowel in STRUT words – but may do the same thing in FOOT
words (since they do not natively distinguish the STRUT and FOOT vowels). Hence
the phenomenon of northerners pronouncing sugar to rhyme with RP rugger, and
pudding like RP budding. Phrases like good luck are particularly problematic: north-
erners attempting to sound posh may easily change the ﬁrst word as well as the
second, or indeed sometimes the ﬁrst word but not the second. The word gas-
mask gives rise to the same problem: if your basic pronunciation is with a short
vowel in each word, and you later discover that it is considered better to use a
long vowel in mask and grass, you might well lengthen the vowel in gas as well.
If people have these problems in hitting the intended target in pronunciation, they
would obviously have similar problems in reformed spelling if it were to follow
RP too slavishly.
Accent prejudice and spelling reform
Spelling reformers have to confront sociolinguistic facts of this kind. Many ways
of pronouncing are liable to be condemned as ugly and uneducated and not to be
encouraged. Though this may well depend on the unfavourable stereotyping of the
social groups who pronounce in these ways, we have to recognize that such stigma-
tization exists. If in a spelling reform we make provision for the such stigmatized
pronunciations, we could be seen as bolstering vulgarity and ignorance. The objec-
tive, scientiﬁc observer of course discounts these social views and refuses to make
J. C. 
Wells

ENGLISH ACCENTS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR SPELLING REFORM
283
such value judgments, but a reforming movement does have to take such preju-
dices into account.
H-dropping
A case in point is h-dropping. Millions of English people do not pronounce /h/
consistently: they omit it most or all of the time. We can still understand them.
So it might seem logical to omit the letter h from our reformed spelling, and
write pairs such as harm and arm identically, in line with that pronunciation. But
no! That would go against the social attitude that it is incorrect to drop /h/ and
that therefore the spelling ought to reﬂect its presence; and it would shock all
the Scots, Irish, and Americans who are strangers to h-dropping. Obviously we
should not continue to write h in the words honest and hour; but it would cer-
tainly be wise to continue to write it in harm and house, to reﬂect the prestige
pronunciation that does distinguish harm from arm – even if this is going to con-
stitute a spelling problem for h-droppers.
Northernisms
So with some of the other phonetic variables we have considered. These preju-
dices might well say that we must retain the difference between the STRUT
and FOOT vowels in our reformed spelling, perhaps by writing u and oo respec-
tively. This is not the only vowel-sound contrast which some people don’t 
make, despite a widespread feeling that it would be better if they did so. Another
example is the vowel contrast between the lexical sets SQUARE and NURSE.
Liverpudlians,4 for example, typically have these vowel sounds merged, so that 
fair and fur are not distinguished, and the name Mary is pronounced to rhyme 
with furry. Again, perhaps we ought to keep the distinction in a reformed orthog-
raphy, despite the problems that Liverpudlians will then face in remembering 
the correct spelling. That is to say, we ought to reﬂect the vowel-sound contrasts that
everybody makes except northerners. This is hard on the northerners, but maybe
that’s life as it is – unless we can somehow remove these prejudices about accents.
The -ing ending
Similar considerations apply to the ending -ing. Almost everywhere where English
is spoken there is a rivalry between a relatively high-status pronunciation with a
velar nasal (as in sing) and a relatively low-status pronunciation with an alveolar
nasal (as in sin). The low-status variant is reﬂected in our current orthographic
conventions by writing n’, thus runnin’ rather than running. Again, I think there
would be general agreement that we have to keep the ing spelling, to reﬂect the
prestige pronunciation.
Other pronunciation variables
Declining status of RP
I have the impression that reform proposals this century – those originating in
Britain, at least – have been very ﬁrmly based upon RP, together with some nods
J. C. 
Wells

284
E X T E N S I O N
in the direction of archaizing tendencies (which is why historical r is reﬂected).
It is clear that in the last quarter of a century in England the position of RP has
been very seriously eroded, in that RP no longer enjoys the unquestioned status
that it previously did. There are now many people who not only don’t speak it
– that was always the case – but who also don’t aspire to it, and who would
regard it as quite unrealistic to aspire towards it. In fact I think what has changed
is the perceived model of beautiful or ideal speech, which is for many people no
longer RP. This can be seen in all sorts of ways. Teachers of English as a foreign
language, for example, get increasingly dissatisﬁed with the transcriptions the pho-
neticians offer them as the models for foreigners to imitate. This is what lies behind
the change in the phonetic transcription of the ﬁnal vowel in words like happy.
Until the 1980s it was identiﬁed with the vowel of bit. But now [2003] the many
people who use a ﬁnal beat-like vowel no longer feel it as lacking the prestige
that formerly attached to using only a bit-like vowel. Current pronouncing dic-
tionaries (EPD 1997; LPD 1990, 2000)5 write it with a compromise symbol, to
accommodate the many speakers whose vowel is more similar to that of beat.
Allophonic variation
I have yet to discuss various technical phonological questions like the phonemic
principle. It is clear that where we have allophonic differences, that is, realiza-
tional differences within a phoneme, we can ignore them. This means that essen-
tially where two sounds are used in such a way that we can predict from the
surrounding sounds which will be used, then we can ignore any such difference.
This is why we can ignore the difference between an ordinary t-sound and a 
glottal stop: whichever way you say that is, not only but also, the meaning is the
same and your choice of pronunciation should not inﬂuence your choice of spelling.
Contrary to popular belief, there are certain positions in a word where a glottal
stop is by now the norm, as in department or atmosphere, and many other where
it is very widely used, as in network, football. Another example is the really rather
sharp difference between the o-sound that many people use in most cases (go,
show) and the o-sound they use before /l/ (goal, shoulder). As long as we can set
up a rule that our long o-sound has a special pronunciation before /l/, there is
no problem: the two sounds are just allophonic variants of the same phoneme.
They may sound a bit different but the difference is predictable, and so it may
be ignored in an orthography.
American intervocalic t
American intervocalic t is an interesting case, because it is moving from being
allophonic to involving a neutralization and therefore becoming phonemic. As you
know, in words such as city, waited, and in phrases such as right away, Americans
tend to use a d-like sound. Indeed, increasingly it is identical with their d-sound,
so that atom and Adam are pronounced identically. Or there may be a subtle dis-
tinction, perhaps more in the mind of the speaker than perceptible for the hearer.
In 1961 Webster’s Third International 6 was the ﬁrst American dictionary to tran-
scribe these words with /d/. For this it incurred considerable criticism: the /d/

pronunciation was said to be slovenly speech which should not be admitted to the
dictionary. Nevertheless, it is a fact; and I have even encountered reverse spellings:
I read an American novel in which somebody gave an ‘involuntary shutter’, shut-
ter and shudder for the author clearly not being distinct. But we shall not want to
admit this to a reformed spelling scheme. Americans will have to learn by rote
which words are written with t and which with d. That would accord with their
prejudices in many cases anyhow, so is not yet a problem; but it may be so in a
hundred years’ time, particularly if this sound-change spreads, as seems likely, to
all other accents of English. Already it occurs in Australia, South Africa and England,
being heard as a stylistic variant even in RP. I don’t see a major problem, par-
ticularly since in most cases the pronunciation of related words (wait, atomic) will
make it clear whether the spelling should be t or d.
Conclusion
What I hope I have done is to highlight the dangers of parochialism in designing
a reformed orthography for English, of being unaware of the varying patterns of
contrast in different accents. But even with this awareness, it is impossible to sat-
isfy all of the speakers all of the time; the best that can be hoped is that a pro-
posed reform will satisfy most of the speakers most of the time.

Questions, suggestions and issues to consider
1
Go back and read the brief discussion of the history of English spelling in Unit
B4, and if you want more information, look at the sections in Crystal (2003b)
and McArthur (1992).
2
What would you think of proposals to have different alphabets for (say) British
English, American English and Australian English? Consider the pros and cons.
3
If a new spelling system were to be imposed for English, would it be reasonable
to ask those people whose pronunciation didn’t conform to it to change their speech
habits?
4
The most frequent sound in English is /e/, and yet proposals for reformed
spelling typically have no symbol for it. Why should this be?

Danish, Japanese, Chinese.
THE SOCIOLINGUISTICS OF MODERN RP
Peter Trudgill (reprinted from Sociolinguistic Variation and Change (2002), Edinburgh:
Edinburgh University Press, pp. 173–80).
Peter Trudgill is a leading sociolinguist who has written extensively on the attitudes of
the general population to speech. Here he discusses the current changes he has detected
in the public perception of various British English regional and social varieties, dealing
not only with traditional Received Pronunciation (as his own title would suggest), but
also taking in developments in a wide range of local accents, and what he considers to be
the ‘myth’ of Estuary English.
Regional and social variation
The relationship between social and regional accent variation in Britain has often
been modelled as having the form of an equilateral triangle1 (following Daniel
Jones, as reported in Ward (1929) where, however, the diagram takes the form
of a cone). The base of the triangle is broad, implying considerable amounts of
phonological variation between the different regional accents spoken by the lower
social classes. Going upwards from the base, the increasing narrowness of the tri-
angle implies decreasing regional variation between the accents of speakers higher
up the social scale. Similarly, the point at the top of the triangle indicates the
total lack of regional variation we have already noted as characteristic of the RP
accent, spoken as it is by people at the top of the social scale. There is no doubt
that this model is an effective one. It is impossible, as we have said, to tell where

an RP speaker comes from. It is usually possible to tell which broad region of
the country middle-class speakers come from. And working-class speakers can usu-
ally be pinpointed even more accurately as to their geographical origins. Thus, an
unskilled manual worker might be recognisable by anybody having the appropri-
ate sort of linguistic knowledge as coming from Bristol, a non-manual worker as
coming from the West Country, a middle-class professional person as coming from
somewhere in the south of England, and an upper-middle class RP speaker as 
coming simply from England, even if all of them had their origins in Bristol. Equally,
a typical middle-class person from Birmingham will obviously have an accent which
is phonetically and phonologically different from that of a middle-class person from
Bristol, but the differences between the accents of two working-class speakers from
the same places will be even greater.
There is a further interesting complication which we can add to the model,
which has to do with a number of varieties of English spoken outside Britain,
notably in Ireland and in the southern hemisphere – South Africa, New Zealand
and Australia. In Australia, it is usual for linguists to claim that Australian English
phonology demonstrates no, or very little, regional variation, but some consider-
able social variation. It has also become usual to refer to Australian accents as
falling into one of three social accent types: cultivated, general, and broad. These
terms are rather unfortunate since they suggest that there are three discrete vari-
eties rather than the continuum of varieties which obviously exists, but the status-
ordering is clear from the terminology: cultivated Australian consists of the 
accents with the highest status, while broad Australian consists of those with the
lowest status, and general Australian comes in between. How does one recognise
these accents linguistically? The answer is quite straightforward. Until relatively
recently, RP had a role to play in Australian society as the accent with the high-
est status, and RP speakers were the people who were employed in broadcasting.
Now, RP as such has more or less disappeared from Australia. It is associated in
the minds of Australians with upper-class Britain, and increasing Australian 
national self-conﬁdence and cultural independence vis-à-vis the ‘mother country’
has meant that there are now very few, if any, native speakers of RP left in the
country. However, the inﬂuence of the legacy of RP in Australia is still vitally
important: cultivated Australian is precisely the accent type which most closely
resembles RP, while broad Australian is the one which resembles it least. We
should, that is, make a place in our triangle for regional varieties from beyond
Britain as well.
The triangle model is also accurate in that it implies, correctly, that the sit-
uation is one which involves continua – both a social accent continuum, from high
status to low status accents, and a geographical accent continuum, from one end
of the country to another. Accurate, that is, with one exception: like standard
dialects, RP is a standard accent which has undergone, albeit implicitly rather than
explicitly, codiﬁcation. The point is that speakers either have an RP accent or they
do not. There are many people who have a so called ‘near-RP’ accent, but this
is by deﬁnition not an RP accent. When it comes to employing a codiﬁed lan-
guage variety, a miss is as good as a mile. Just as someone who otherwise uses
only grammatical forms associated with Standard English but habitually says I seen

it cannot be said to be a speaker of Standard English, it takes only one non-RP
feature for a speaker not to be a speaker of RP.
Innovations in RP
This raises the interesting quasi-philosophical question of what is and is not an 
RP feature. RP, like all accents and dialects of all languages, is subject to changes,
some of which are certainly internally generated. Descriptions of some of these
can be found in Gimson (1962) and Wells (1982), and probably include the fronting
of the GOAT vowel, and lowering of the TRAP vowel. Other changes, however,
clearly make their way into RP over time by diffusion upwards from lower-
status accents. Features which used not to be RP and now are RP probably include:
a.
the employment of intrusive /r/;
b.
the replacement of /nv/ by /q/ in the lexical set of lost, cloth, off;
c.
glottalling2 of syllable-ﬁnal /t/ before another consonant;
d. the merger of /ro/, /no/ and /nv/;
e.
the fronting of /uv/ from [uv] towards [uv].
As the discussion above suggested, the criterion for the inclusion of any feature
in RP must be that it is not a regional feature. This implies that there will be
features that for a period of time, while a change is taking place, may have an
indeterminate status. One good example is provided by the case of what Wells
(1982) has called happY-tensing.3 This involves the replacement through time of
word-ﬁnal unstressed /I/ by /iv/, so that /hæpI/ becomes /hæpiv/. At the level
of regional accents, this innovation appears to be one which is most characteris-
tic of southern accents but which has been spreading northwards for many decades.
For example, the Survey of English Dialects records show that many counties in the
south of England which now have -/iv/ had -/I/ in the speech of rural traditional
dialect speakers in the 1950s and 1960s.
RP has always had /I/ in such items. This was the one respect in which it
resembled north of England rather than south of England accents. It was also the
case that there were many people who had near-RP accents in that they had RP
accents except that they had happY-tensing. We could deﬁne such people as non-
RP speakers because happY-tensing was a regional feature – they were obviously
from somewhere in the south of England. However, there is now some evidence
that happY-tensing is, or at least is going to be, a feature of RP. The conclusive
evidence would be if we could show that younger speakers who otherwise have
only RP features and who come from areas of the north of England which do not
have happY-tensing nevertheless do have it, unlike their – we could now say –
regionally accented colleagues. HappY-tensing will now no longer be a regional
feature, though absence of happY-tensing will be. Note that this will force us into
the position of having to say either that certain people aged, say, ﬁfty who have
happY-tensing are not RP speakers, while certain people aged, say, twenty who
have happY-tensing are RP speakers; or, perhaps alternatively, that ﬁfty-year-old
people who used not to be RP-speakers have now become RP speakers without
changing the way they speak at all. I would personally not ﬁnd either of these
solutions ridiculous.

Changes in the sociolinguistic situation of RP
Phonetic and phonological changes are not the only changes which have been 
taking place involving RP. In the last few decades there have also been a number
of changes in the sociolinguistic situation of RP, and in its relationship to other
accents. Much of this appears to stem from a change in attitudes towards RP 
and other accents of British English on the part of the British population as a
whole. Most of what we know about attitudes to English accents derives from 
a whole series of research programmes carried out by the social psychologist 
Howard Giles and his associates, particularly in the 1970s. Giles (see, for exam-
ple, 1987), very skilfully using a whole range of research techniques, most notably
matched-guise experiments,4 showed that it was a reasonably straightforward 
matter to gain access to people’s attitudes to different accents of English without
asking them directly – something which would naturally have produced a series
of skewed results.
It was apparent from Giles’ work that RP was perceived as being an accent
associated, in the absence of information to the contrary, with speakers who were
competent, reliable, educated, and conﬁdent. It was also perceived as being the
most aesthetically pleasing of all British English accents. On the other hand, RP
speakers scored low on traits like friendliness, companionability, and sincerity, 
and messages couched in RP also proved to be less persuasive than the same 
messages in local accents. (Notice also that there is a long history in American
science-ﬁction and horror ﬁlms for sinister, menacing characters to be given RP
accents.)
As far as changes in the last twenty years are concerned, we lack reliable
research on most of these issues, but it is a matter of common – and not neces-
sarily unreliable – observation that the RP accent is no longer the necessary pass-
port to employment of certain sorts that it once was. Non-RP accents are very
much more common on the BBC, for example, than they were forty years ago.
And telephone sales companies, as I know from frequent requests from such com-
panies for advice, now think about which regional accents will be most effective
rather than automatically employing non-regional RP.
Discrimination on the grounds of accent still, unfortunately, occurs in British
society. But this discrimination is no longer against all regional accents but only
against those from, as it were, lower down the triangle. And it is also no longer
permitted in British society to be seen to discriminate against someone on the
basis of their accent – it has to masquerade as something else. This hypocrisy is
a sign of progress, of an increase in democratic and egalitarian ideals. This has
also, probably, though again we lack the research, had the consequence that an
RP accent can be even more of a disadvantage in certain social situations than was
formerly the case. In many sections of British society, some of the strongest 
sanctions are exercised against people who are perceived as being ‘posh’ and ‘snob-
bish’. These factors also mean that many fewer people than before are now speak-
ers of what Wells (1982:283–5) has called adoptive RP: that is, many fewer people
than before who are not native speakers of RP attempt, as adolescents or adults,
to acquire and use this accent. Even Conservative Party politicians no longer have
to strive for RP accents, as a recent Conservative Prime Minister once did.

E X T E N S I O N
The death of RP?
In spite of these observations, it is necessary to be sceptical about reports of two
different types that appear to be rather common anecdotally, especially on the
part of journalists in need of something to write about. The ﬁrst is that RP is
disappearing. The second is that RP is being replaced by a new, potentially non-
regional accent. I will now discuss these two scenarios, which are largely myths,
in turn.
There seem to be a number of reasons for the erroneous but understandable
misperception that RP is disappearing. First, non-RP accents are now found, as
we have already noted, in situations from which they would have been excluded
only a few decades ago. It is therefore easy to gain an impression that there are
fewer RP speakers than formerly. Second, the kind of people who in earlier gen-
erations would have been speakers of adoptive RP no longer are, as we have
already observed. So there actually are fewer RP speakers, though not necessar-
ily fewer native speakers. Third, RP itself, again as we have already seen, has
changed. It has acquired – as it always has over the generations – forms that
before were part of local, notably southeast of England accents. This is what leads
journalists to report that Public School pupils now ‘speak Cockney’. It is true that
RP now admits certain types of /t/-glottalling which were formerly associated
with local accents only – but that most certainly does not mean that it is Cockney.
This perception resembles the belief now current in my own home city, Norwich,
where older people frequently complain that the youngsters ‘talk like Londoners’.
When asked why they say this, they invariably reply: ‘Young people say ﬁng instead
of thing.’ This is quite true (see Chapter 6) but otherwise they still sound as
Norwich people have sounded for decades. One salient phonological feature can
lead to utterly inaccurate stereotypical reports.
As far as RP is concerned, the ongoing work of Fabricius (2000) shows that
the younger generations of those sections of the community one would expect to
be RP speakers still are RP speakers. Pupils at Eton, and undergraduates at Cambridge
University who are former pupils at the major Public Schools, are still for the
most part RP speakers. Their RP has some new features, but these features are
all, including /t/-glottalling, non-regional features and therefore must still be con-
sidered as being RP. (Non-regionality is a necessary but not sufﬁcient condition
for a feature to be considered RP. For instance, if all regions of England were to
acquire /h/-dropping, something which will actually happen if, as seems possible,
this phenomenon eventually reaches the northeast of England, that would not make
it an RP feature!)
A competitor for RP?
As far as the second myth is concerned, this has to do with the development of
so-called ‘Estuary English’. This is an inaccurate term which, however, has become
widely accepted. It is inaccurate because it suggests that we are talking about a
new variety, which we are not; and because it suggests that it is a variety of
English conﬁned to the banks of the Thames Estuary, which it is not. The label
actually refers to the lower middle-class accents of the Home Counties which 
Peter
Trudgill

THE SOCIOLINGUISTICS OF MODERN RP
291
surround London: Essex and Kent, which do border on the Thames Estuary, but
also parts or all of Surrey, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Hertfordshire, which
do not. Early ‘descriptions’ using this label were by non-linguists. However, as
described by John Wells, and by Altendorf (1999), Estuary English has obvious
south-east of England features such as diphthong-shift,5 /l/-vocalisation6 and merger
of vowels before /l/,7 but it does not have features typical of working-class accents
only, such as th-fronting.8
It is easy to obtain an impression from reading some of the commentators
that ‘Estuary English’ is advancing on all fronts. I would like to dispute this, in
some measure. There are a number of explanatory factors for this perception.
First, as we have already seen, many people who in earlier generations would
have become speakers of adoptive RP no longer become so. People who are upwardly
socially mobile or who come into the public eye may still in fact reduce the num-
ber of regional features in their accents – they will move themselves up the tri-
angle, as it were – but they will no longer remove all such features. It is therefore
undoubtedly true that many more people than was formerly the case can be heard
in public situations, especially in the media, speaking with lower middle-class regional
accents. And of course the most prominent of these are from the south-east of
England, (a) because this is the largest region of England in terms of population,
and (b) because there is a considerable metropolitan bias in the media, with most
nationally available media being broadcast from or published in London. Secondly
there has been a certain amount of upward social mobility in the last twenty years
which has found people from lower middle-class backgrounds in socially promi-
nent positions in which it would have been unusual to ﬁnd them previously. Thirdly,
at least some of the phonological features associated with ‘Estuary English’ are
currently spreading, as London-based features have done for centuries, outwards
into surrounding areas. In East Anglia, for example, /l/-vocalisation has not yet
reached Norwich, but, as discussed (with maps) in Trudgill (1986), it reached
Cambridge and Colchester some decades ago and is beginning to affect Ipswich.
It is therefore undoubtedly the case that lower middle-class south-eastern accents
cover a wider geographical area than was formerly the case, and will probably
continue to spread for some time to come.
What I would strenuously dispute, however, is that this means that ‘Estuary
English’ is going to be the ‘new RP’. It is unlikely that it will ever become 
anything more than a regional accent, albeit the accent of a rather large region
covering, together with its lower-class counterparts, the Home Counties plus, prob-
ably, Sussex, Hampshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and parts of
Northamptonshire. The sociolinguistic conditions are not such that it could turn
into the new RP. There is no parallel here to the nationwide network of resi-
dential Public Schools which gave rise to RP. What we know about the geo-
graphical diffusion of linguistic innovations, moreover, indicates that there is no
way in which the inﬂuence of London is going to be able to counteract the inﬂuence
of large centres such as Liverpool and Newcastle which are at some distance from
London. And we also know that linguistic innovations are not spread by radio and
television (see Trudgill 1986).

Trudgill

E X T E N S I O N
Reports that a few individual features such as th-fronting are spreading across
Britain northwards and westwards from London, though undoubtedly true, do not
invalidate this point. This spreading of individual features is something which has
al-ways happened, and in any case th-fronting is not to be considered an ‘Estuary
English’ feature. The fact that young people in Cardiff are now using /t/
-glottalling does not mean that they are speaking London English, or RP. And the
fact that young people in Shefﬁeld are now using th-fronting does not mean that
they are speaking Cockney. As anyone who has been to Shefﬁeld recently can
attest, people there do not sound remotely like Cockneys – or even like ‘Estuary
English’ speakers.
This leads me again to raise the topic of which model to employ for teach-
ing so-called ‘British English’, in reality English English, to non-native learners. It
has been suggested that it would now make more sense to teach learners ‘Estuary
English’ rather than RP. Of course, it must be true that there are more speakers
of ‘Estuary English’ in England than there are of RP. And of course it is a good
idea if twenty-four-year-old Poles, say, sound as much as possible like twenty-
four-year-old, rather than ninety-four-year-old, English people. I would therefore
advocate rather strongly teaching intrusive /r/ and some forms of /t/-glottalling
at least to advanced students. But I would not advocate the teaching of ‘Estuary
English’ or of features associated solely with it, such as diphthong-shifted vowels
or /l/-vocalisation, since these are speciﬁcally regional features.
New dialect and accent regions
The geographical spread of ‘Estuary English’ is part of a much bigger trend. What
is happening in Britain, and probably not only there, as far as regional linguistic
variation is concerned, is rather complicated. On the one hand, much regional
variation is being lost as the large number of traditional dialects covering small
geographical areas gradually disappear from most, though by no means all, parts
of the country. These, however, are being replaced by a much smaller number
of new modern dialect areas covering much larger areas. The dialects and accents
associated with these areas are much less different from one another, and much
less different from RP and Standard English, than the traditional dialects were.
However, and this is crucial, in terms of phonology they are for the most part
currently diverging, not converging. The work of the European Science Foundation
Network on Dialect Divergence and Convergence paints a very similar picture
Europe-wide. Work in large urban centres such as Liverpool, Newcastle and Cardiff
shows that, although these places are adopting some nationwide features such as
labio-dental /r/, /t/-glottalling and th-fronting, they also demonstrate indepen-
dent divergent developments, such as voiceless-stop affrication in Liverpool and,
from my own work in Norwich, [ . . . ], the widespread smoothing of triphthongs
as in doing /dmvn/, knowing /nqvn/, and the merger of the vowels of NEAR and
SQUARE (see Trudgill 1999). This is probably part of a much larger scale world-
wide pattern where varieties of English around the world, while they may de-
monstrate lexical convergence, are diverging phonologically: accents of English from
New Zealand to the United States are getting less like one another, not more (see
the introduction to this section).
Peter
Trudgill

THE SOCIOLINGUISTICS OF MODERN RP
293
Parallel to the development of a large dialect region centred on London, whose
lower middle-class accents have been referred to as ‘Estuary English’, we are 
seeing the development of similar areas elsewhere, as yet not much studied by
linguists, focusing on centres such as Belfast, Dublin, Cardiff, Glasgow, Newcastle, Not-
tingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol. Mats Thelander
(1979) reported similar developments twenty years ago from northern Sweden.
London-based journalists have not noticed this kind of development, but this
is no reason for linguists to ignore it. To focus pedagogically on one of the newer,
larger regional accents of British English to the detriment of all the others, just
because it happens to be spoken in London, would be the worst kind of metropoli-
tan bias, of which there is far too much in Britain already.
Conclusion
I am a non-RP speaker, but I believe that it is convenient that students learning
English English still have a non-regional model available to them. The fact is that
in spite of the developments just outlined, the triangle model remains an accurate
one for a description of social and regional patterns of accent variation in Britain.
The development of a network of regional varieties in Britain is taking place, as
it were, underneath a non-regional, nationwide layer provided by RP. This layer
is thinner than it was – the minority is probably even smaller than it was – but
it is likely to remain intact until British society undergoes even more radical changes
in its social structure than it has already undergone in the last twenty years.

Questions, suggestions and issues to consider

the same concept as Trudgill’s triangle. To what extent do the two overlap?
2 If you are a native speaker of English, have you ever attempted consciously to change
your pronunciation? If so, did you move up or down the sociolinguistic pyramid?
3 Are you a ‘linguistic chameleon’? In other words, do you change your speech accord-
ing to the social context?
4 If you come from a country other Britain, does the sociolinguistic pyramid ﬁt the
sociolinguistic patterning of your own country?

5 What do you think are the main inﬂuences on the speech of young people either
in Britain or in your own country?
6 Take ﬁve regions of Britain (or your native country) and rank the regional
accents in order of prestige. What are the problems involved in doing this?
7 It is said that the BBC and many of the independent companies now have a con-
scious policy of refusing to employ announcers and presenters with traditional
RP accents. What would account for this? Listen to some British radio or TV sta-
tions if you are able to receive them and see if you agree.
8 As a non-native, if you could begin learning English again from scratch, which
accent would you adopt? Would it be the equivalent of traditional RP, NRP, Estuary
English or a more strongly regionally localisable form?
9 Do you personally know any traditional RP speakers? Or do you know a celebrity
who’s appeared on television and radio who speaks traditional RP? Do they
match up with the stereotype of the accent?
10 Do you agree with Trudgill that Estuary English is a myth?

GLOSSARY
There is a certain amount of ﬂexibility in phonetic terminology. The meanings given
here are naturally those we have used in this book but in a few cases we have added
terms commonly employed by other writers. No attempt has been made to provide
precise, elegant, formal deﬁnitions but rather to use language which is reasonably easy
to understand. Words in bold are deﬁned elsewhere in the glossary.
Many works on phonetics have a glossary similar to this. Three which provide much
more coverage and detail are Trask’s (1996) Dictionary of Phonetics and Phonology,

Journals
Many of the journals in the ﬁelds of phonetics and phonology, although containing
excellent scholarly work, are somewhat forbidding to the non-specialist. Two excep-
tions, concentrating on present-day language usage and world varieties, are English
Today and English World-Wide.
English Today has a variety of lively articles aimed at a general audience and many
of these deal with pronunciation matters. English World-Wide is more academic in its
approach but often has readable descriptions of research into many aspects of English
pronunciation, with an emphasis on accent variation.
One other journal that may prove to be of interest is English Language Teaching,
which offers useful advice and reports of linguistic research aimed at those teaching
English to non-native speakers. The material is wide-ranging, dealing with all aspects,
including pronunciation training.
Websites
You don’t need us to tell you that the Internet is a wonderful source of information,
education and entertainment. And that it’s especially useful for many aspects of 
phonetics, phonology, and dialect research. Furthermore, most of what it provides
for the student phonetician comes absolutely free of charge. Be warned, though! Internet
websites, like mushrooms, suddenly appear – and then, like ghosts, just as mysteri-
ously disappear, sometimes only to reappear under a changed name. You have to keep
your wits about you when using web resources.
We list here just a very small selection of the best (and most permanent) of the
numerous websites concerned with phonetics now available on the Internet. By going

314
F U R T H E R  R E A D I N G
to these, you can gain access to an enormous amount of background information on
phonetics, phonology, acoustics, accents, and much more. You can obtain, free of charge,
excellent phonetic fonts. Be sure to download the modern ones called Unicode, which
enable you to read phonetic material with ease and send it to other people. Perhaps
you’re interested in experimenting with speech analysis programs such as WASP or
Praat (also available free of charge). These will enable you, for example, to discover
the nature of your intonation patterns, and then allow you to synthesise new speech
melodies and superimpose them on your original utterances. You can also go to 
sites with collections of accents and dialects (including Estuary English), read a wide
selection of articles on pronunciation, ﬁnd the original recordings of the cardinal 
vowels, watch videos of vowel and consonant articulations and of the vocal folds 
in action – we could go on! Finally, don’t forget the website accompanying this book
(see below).
