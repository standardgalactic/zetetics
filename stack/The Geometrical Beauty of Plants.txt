Preface
In my study of natural shapes, more speciﬁcally of bamboo, I started using the
superellipses and supercircles of Gabriel Lamé around 1994 to study the shape of
certain square bamboos. The ﬁrst publication was in the Belgian Bamboo Society
Newsletter in 1996 followed by a presentation by Prof. Freddy Van Oystaeyen in
the same year at a meeting at the University of Louvain organized by the Belgian
Plant and Tissue Culture Group and published in the journal Botanica Scripta
Belgica. Three years later, in 1997, I was able to generalize these curves into what
I originally called superformula, as a generalization of supercircles, following joint
work with Bert Beirinckx on superellipses. In 1999, I founded a company with the
explicit aim to disseminate these ideas in science, technology, and education, with
better than expected results.
My ﬁrst presentation on the more general use of Lamé curves in botany was in
1997 at the Symposium Morphology, Anatomy and Systematics in Leuven, in
honor of the great German plant scientist Wilhelm Troll. The symposium was
co-organized by the Deutsche Botanische Gesellschaft and by the Botany
Department of the University of Louvain. The talk went quite well, and in the
closing speech, Erik Smets remarked that it was hoped that I could bring fresh ideas
to mathematical botany; the untimely death of the late Aristid Lindenmayer had left
a deep gap in that ﬁeld. On advice of Focko Weberling, one of Troll’s students,
I was contacted by Springer Verlag that same week to publish a book on my work.
In a sense, this book is 20 years overdue, but pauca sed matura was Gauss’ motto.
In 2003, the ﬁrst major scientiﬁc paper was published in the American Journal of
Botany, on invitation by the editor in chief, Karl J. Niklas. The title “A generic
geometric transformation which uniﬁes a wide range of natural and abstract
shapes” expresses the gist of the matter. This publication attracted a lot of attention,
and I still think it was a good timing and (hoped for but unexpected) strategy for
dissemination. In the same year, the English version of my book Inventing the
Circle was published, two years after the Dutch version in 2001. My journey took
me from horticulture and plant biotechnology to geometry. The article “Universal
Natural Shapes” with Stefan Haesen and Leopold Verstraelen in 2005 introduced
the equation into the ﬁeld of geometers, and also substituted the name superformula
ix

by the names Gielis curves, surfaces, (sub-)manifolds, and transformations.
In geometry, a whole new world unveiled before me. This, along with several
publications by others ensured the adoption and absorption of the formula in
mathematics, science, and education. Two of my main goals, formulated in 1999,
have been or are being realized, along various paths.
Technology was my third, long-term goal, and many papers in science and
technology have been published using the formula. In many cases (antennas
and nanotechnology, for example), the formula allowed to go beyond the classical
and canonical shapes, opening many doors. My own passion about technology is
this: No matter what ﬁeld we consider, I (with many others) think our current
technology, no matter how advanced, is essentially a bag-of-tricks, aimed at
deception (which is perhaps a major feature of our times and culture). We are
working toward new applications following my dream of unifying and simplifying,
at the same time appreciating complexity.
In this respect, it is important to note that my background is horticulture and
plant biotechnology. I have been involved as researcher and research director in
plant research for more than 25 years, and methods were developed in our team for
mass propagation of plants, in particular temperate and tropical bamboos, the for-
mer for ornamental purposes, the latter for reforestation in the tropics. Over the past
years, we have produced over 20 million bamboos that have been distributed and
planted worldwide. Bamboo is indeed a multipurpose plant, a beautiful plant for our
gardens but providing building materials, food, and much more for the poorest one
billion humans on this planet.
Key to this was focused in-depth research using molecular markers and
high-throughput determination of plant hormones, but never losing sight of the end
goal: plant production. The same procedure of combining science with technology,
we use now in the development of antennas, where optimization is an ongoing
activity. We are now able to produce very powerful antennas, at costs which could
be up to ten times less than existing ones, optimizing margin, while delivering the
highest possible quality and efﬁciency. In all my (scientiﬁc and engineering)
activities, this combination of wide interests, a generalist (rather than myopic) view,
and stamina has always led to remarkable results.
Always keep focused on what you want to achieve. The current book is a
combination of such focus, combining wide interests (nature and science) and a
generalist (rather than specialist) attitude, inspired by the vision of natural scientists
and philosophers from a long gone era. Along the way, I learned many other things,
which one cannot learn but by a constant drive and strive to understand. My
scientiﬁc education continues daily.
I wish to convey my sincere gratitude to my parents and all teachers, botanists,
mathematicians, and engineers who played an enormously important role in my
personal scientiﬁc development and the various developments described in this
book: These include my teachers in high school Fred Verstappen (Greek) and
Gerard Bodifée (sciences); in my professional horticultural and plant biotechno-
logical life: Pierre Debergh (University of Ghent), Walter Liese (University of
Hamburg, Germany), Tom Gerats (Radboud University, The Netherlands), and

About the Book
This book focuses on the origin of the Gielis curves, surfaces, and transformations
in the plant sciences. It is shown how these transformations, as a generalization
of the Pythagorean theorem, play an essential role in plant morphology and
development. New insights show how plants can be understood as developing
mathematical equations, which opens the possibility of directly solving analytically
any boundary value problem (stress, diffusion, vibration…). This book illustrates
how form, development, and evolution of plants unveil as a musical symphony. The
reader will gain insight in how the methods are applicable in many diverse scientiﬁc
and technological ﬁelds.

Chapter 1
Universal Natural Shapes
The geometrical description of curves and surfaces and the
shapes that are derived via Gielis-transformations, describe
and determine in a uniform and universal way an enormous
diversity of natural shapes.
Leopold Verstraelen
Conic Sections at the Core, Once More
In the book Inventing the Circle [1] it was shown how one generic geometric
description, a generalization of Pythagoras and Lamé, allows for the description of
many natural shapes, illustrated with many pictures and illustrations. The same
ideas were published in the American Journal of Botany in April 2003 [2]. In 2004
this generic geometric transformation was named Gielis Transformations, giving
rise to the class of Gielis curves and surfaces, by the geometer Leopold Verstraelen,
who understood that this transformation allows for a broadening of some crucial
concepts in geometry. Its actions on classic curves could describe a wide range of
shapes in nature [3]: “The basic shapes of the highly diverse creatures, objects and
phenomena, as they are observed by humans, either visually or with the aid of
sophisticated apparatus, can essentially, either singular or in combination, be
considered as derived from a limited number of special types of geometric ﬁgures.
From Greek science up to the present this is probably the most important subject of
natural philosophy… The geometrical description of curves and surfaces and the
shapes that are derived via Gielis-transformations, describe and determine in a
uniform and universal way an enormous diversity of natural shapes”.
Because of this wide applicability—the Gielis Formula describes shapes at nano,
micro, macro and gigascale—the idea of Universal Natural Shapes was born,
providing for a uniform description of natural shapes (Fig. 1.1). T. Philips of the
Courant Institute wrote [4]: “A botanical Kepler awaiting his Newton”. Obviously,
this waiting can take a while. In the meantime we have deepened our understanding
of its applicability to study natural shapes and broadening of concepts in geometry
and mathematics. This book describes some of these developments, and shows how

it connects various ideas and ﬁelds, starting from the principles developed by
Ancient Greek mathematicians.
Like Inventing the Circle this book is one of ideas, rather than technical. It can
be considered as the second part of a trilogy. Inventing the Circle introduced the
new transformations, and provided many examples of such shapes in nature. In this
book we will focus on some of the underlying geometrical aspects based on the
subtitle of the ﬁrst book: The geometrical beauty of nature.
We will follow the universal scheme of building arguments as developed by the
ancient Greeks [5], the Demonstratio artis geometriae.
Pqόsă ri1 or Propositio exposes what needs to be shown, namely that beyond
the mere analogy, we can develop a rigorous geometrical and mathematical
approach to study natural shapes based on Lamé-Gielis curves and surfaces.
Ejheri1 or Expositio describes what we have to start with. From elementary
notions in mathematics that are at work in every ﬁeld of mathematics and its
applications in the natural sciences, we derive Lamé-Gielis curves and surfaces.
Dioqirlό1: in this Determinatio step we investigate “whether what is sought is
possible or impossible, and how far it is practicable and in how many ways”. It will
be shown how the shapes and their combinations can be easily combined with many
existing concepts in geometry and mathematics. This wide applicability applies to a
wide variety of natural shapes, Universal Natural Shapes.
Kasarjetή or Constructio: Observations from botany open the door for
understanding many key concepts and their connections and allow for analytical
solutions of boundary value problems, using classical 19th century methods,
thereby broadening various concepts (Gielis is an acronym) and analytical methods.
What we can learn from ﬂowers and plants can be applied in virtually all ﬁelds of
science and technology.
Apόdeini1 or Demonstratio: in the ﬁnal chapters it is demonstrated how Lamé
and Gielis curves provide better models for studying various natural shapes, and
how they can help understanding evolutionary and developmental aspects in
biology, based on geometrical considerations.
Rtlpέqarla: This then leads to the conclusion that many of the suggestions
made in the original book and articles in the period 1999–2005 have been validated.
Description always precedes understanding the connections between mathematics
and nature. Moreover, Lamé-Gielis curves and Gielis transformations have opened
the door for many new developments, among others for a geometrical theory of
shape and morphogenesis.

Towards a Geometrical Theory
of Morphogenesis
S’il n’est aucune marche tracée pour la recherche de la
solution d’un problème, par la simple considération des ﬁgures,
cette incertitude est peut-être une des grandes richesses de la
Géométrie. Il arrive souvent en effet, qu’en suivant certaine
route pour aller à la découverte, on rencontre la solution d’un
problème différent du proposé, qu’on n’eût sans doute pas
trouvé aussi facilement, s’il se fût agi de le résoudre
directement. Qui doit-on donc le plus admirer, ou du calcul qui
commence ses travaux avec conﬁance, et ﬁnit presque toujours
par répondre à la question, ou de la Géométrie qui part sans
rien promettre, et revient quelquefois offrir avec la solution du
problème, celle de plusieurs autres qu’on ne lui demandait pas,
et qu’elle a recueilli sur son passage?
Gabriel Lamé (1818)
Biology Versus Physics
Understanding life is one of the major challenges for science in the 21st century.
Despite the exponentially growing mountains of data in the life sciences, the
challenge of developing geometrical models, always at the core in eras of scientiﬁc
progress (Newton, Riemann, Einstein), remains completely open. Marcel Berger
wrote explicitly: ‘‘Present models of geometry, even if quite numerous, are not able
to answer various essential questions. For example: among all possible conﬁgu-
rations of a living organism, describe its trajectory (life) in time’’ [6]. We are still
far from describing life mathematically, despite the numerous successful applica-
tions of mathematics in the life sciences.
Applying mathematics in the life sciences brings hope that what works in
physics will also work in biology. In physics, one of the most widely used quotes is
The Unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences by Eugene
Wigner (1902–1995). A geometrization of physics then seems to be a simpler task
than a geometrization of biology. As the Russian mathematician I.M. Gelfand
(1913–2009) who had a great interest in biology said: ‘‘There exists yet another
phenomenon which is comparable in its inconceivability with the inconceivable

effectiveness of mathematics in physics noted by Wigner—this is the equally
inconceivable ineffectiveness of mathematics in biology” [7]. A geometrization of
biology, or more generally of nature, based on forms and formation of natural
shapes (a geometrical theory of morphogenesis) is both an enormous challenge and
a prerequisite for progress in science and the life sciences.
“Why geometry? If we wish to ﬁnd the solution of a problem along routes that
have not been explored before, comparing geometric shapes is one of the greatest
powers of geometry” [8]. Gabriel Lamé (1795–1860) wrote this in 1818, and he
continued: “What should we admire most? Algebra that starts its search for a
solution with conﬁdence and almost always arrives at the response to the question?
Or Geometry that starts out without promising anything, and very often delivers a
solution to the problem along with solutions to many other problems that were even
not asked for, but which can simply be harvested along the way?” Gabriel Lamé
was one of the leading mathematicians in the 19th century, and a dedicated
researcher in search of nature’s most hidden secrets.
Our goal, and the goal of this book, is to offer a contribution to a geometrical
theory of morphogenesis where shape and its formation, the development and
evolution of natural shapes, both living and non-living, can be studied in a math-
ematical way.
A geometrization of biology, or more generally of nature, based on forms and
formation of natural shapes is an enormous challenge. René Thom (1923–2002)
wrote: ‘‘That we can construct an abstract, purely geometrical theory of mor-
phogenesis, independent of the substrate of forms and the nature of the forces that
create them, might seem difﬁcult to believe, especially for the seasoned experi-
mentalist used to working with living matter and always struggling with an elusive
reality” [9].
Such theory would be structurally similar to Newton’s geometrization of grav-
itation. Before Newton a diamond and a piece of black coal were different. After
Newton they were still different forms of carbon, but they behaved exactly the same
when thrown over the wall. This geometric theory for morphogenesis will not be
presented in this book, since it is not yet developed. But we can outline what it
might or should look like.
Ideally the geometrical theory of morphogenesis would be comparable to
Newtonian theory of gravitation, whereby a uniform description of anisotropy (in
the case of planets and comets, the family of conic sections), is followed by a
mathematical theory in terms of isotropy. To make this more precise, the ﬁrst step is
the Kepler-Galilei step. Kepler showed that the orbits of planets are not circles but
ellipses, and Galilei showed that the trajectory of stones, cannon balls and water jets
are parabolas [10]. This provided a uniform description in terms of conic sections.
These conic sections had been known for two millennia, and they turned out to be
very natural, describing the trajectories of planets and projectiles.
The step that Newton took was to determine the curvature of curves (or tra-
jectories of particles) in terms of local operations, by ﬁtting of the circle to a point
on the curve. The radius of the circle is then a measure for the curvature. This idea
8

Towards a Geometrical Theory of Morphogenesis

was suggested already much earlier by Nicolas Oresme, but using analytical
methods Newton could achieve this for all planar curves using the second
derivative, with wonderful results. Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961) understood this
very well: ‘‘The logical content of Newton’s ﬁrst two laws of motion was to state,
that a body moves uniformly in a straight line,….., and we agree upon calling force
its acceleration multiplied by an individual constant. The great achievement was, to
concentrate attention on the second derivatives – to suggest that they – not the ﬁrst
or third or fourth, not any other property of motion – ought to be accounted for by
the environment’’ [11].
Two main lines of development in science may be distinguished. One line
focuses on pure description, where conic sections show up. Here we ﬁnd such
names as Apollonius of Perga (who developed the full theory of conics and conic
sections), Kepler and Galilei (who applied conic sections to describe trajectories of
planets and projectiles) and Gabriel Lamé. The second line focuses on practical
computation, using the isotropic space with the Euclidean circle as the unit circle
with Archimedes, Ptolemy, Newton and Fourier as most important representatives.
The tendency in science seems to me (1) to describe or understand nature
through conic sections, with very compact mathematical descriptions, and (2) to use
these insights to develop computational models of nature using isotropic spaces,
Euclidean circles, and analytic methods based on series as was done by Newton.
The second step in our project of geometrical theory of morphogenesis would
then be the Newton step, generalizing circles and known or new analytic methods
based on inﬁnite series. If we can develop a uniform description from within our
existing mathematics and geometry, there is less need for “new mathematics”,
having little or no connection to what we already have.
If we wish to develop analogous steps for a theory of morphogenesis, this would
require a uniform description of natural shapes as a ﬁrst step. This Kepler-like
description should be as close as possible to circles and conic sections, and to the
Pythagorean Theorem and Euclidean geometry, as almost all scientiﬁc develop-
ments have followed this path (often in disguise). What will be presented in this
book is this ﬁrst step.
Gielis transformations will be the main ingredient. The original name for these
more general transformations was superformula, but the name Gielis curves, sur-
faces and transformations was preferred by mathematicians, a great honor, no less
[12–15]. They are generalizations of Lamé curves and surfaces, named after Gabriel
Lamé. They can be considered as a one-step generalization of conic sections.
Commensurability, Symmetry and Euclidean Geometry
With the requirement of a close connection to Euclidean geometry and the

richer in ideas than is generally thought. The central ideas relate to commensura-
bility, symmetry and harmony. They are intimately connected and form the basis of
this book: The geometrical beauty of natural shapes.
The question of commensurability is at the very heart of science and mathe-
matics. How does one compare the shapes of ﬂowers and circles? Measuring
(lesqex) is key, but how does one deﬁne a common measure or ruler for starﬁsh,
squares, cubes, cylinders or a variety of less regular shapes? And how does one
describe the transition from a circle to a square, or from an egg to a starﬁsh? Is there
a common ruler or compass for such purposes? How does one pass from isotropy—
the idea of (the ideal) circle, as the locus of all points at the same distance from a
central point—to the anisotropy of natural shapes?
This is the reason why symmetry is so central in mathematics. Symmetry (with
—lesqia as its root) for the Ancient Greek mathematicians means proportion or
right balance and to “symmetrize” (rtllesqex) is the deliberate act of measuring
by comparison, thus making objects commensurable, forming the real basis of
mathematics and geometry. Commensurability can come in varieties, the two
extremes being shape in topology, whereby a torus and a teacup have the same
topology, and measure in geometry, with well deﬁned ways of measuring. These
can be same (or constant) length, same area (equi-areal) or n-volume (equi-n-areal),
same duration or isochrony (time), or any scalar valued parameter (isobar, iso-
therm…). The notion of conic sections is based on the same-area-invariant of a
rectangle and a square; paqabokη (parabola) means exact ﬁtting, while ellipse and
hyperbola are too much and too little respectively, for a perfect ﬁt [5].
Symmetry and commensurability are the reasons why geometry remains at
center stage. Geometry, analysis and algebra are the central trinity in mathematics,
but Shiing-Shen Chern (1911–2004) wrote: “While analysis and algebra provide
the foundations of mathematics, geometry is at the core” [16]. There will always be
the need for geometers and their geometric sense. André Weil (1906–1998) wrote at
the end of the 20th century: “Whatever the truth of the matter, mathematics in our
century would not have made such impressive progress without the geometric sense
of Elie Cartan, Heinz Hopf, Chern and a very few more. It seems safe to predict
that such men will always be needed if mathematics is to go on as before” [17].
One of the most deﬁning notions in geometry is that of curvature. Nicolas
Oresme’s work in the Middle Ages focused on geometry and his representation of
shapes by coordinates trying to ﬁnd a common measure with curvitas, curvature
based on a circle, as a measure for deviations from straightness [18]. His motive was
that clear: For him the measure of phenomena (De latitudinibus formarum) should
be geometrical. In this sense geometry is the act to make things stand still in a world
where everything is constantly moving and changing. This may be one of the reasons
why we associate Greek geometrical ideas with rigid geometry. It also carries the
idea that Euclidean geometry deals with statics, not dynamics, the language of
change. On close inspection however, the very notion of differentiation (change) and
integration (quantiﬁcation of change) are already encoded in the parabola.
Shiing-Shin Chern clearly expressed this notion: “Euclidean geometry is the
geometrical treatment of the number system” [19]. The Greek notion of number
10
2
Towards a Geometrical Theory of Morphogenesis

also included irrational numbers, their original invention. Bartel Leendert Van der
Waerden (1903–1996) wrote: “The reason why the Greeks had to translate the
algebraic problems and solutions of the Babylonians into geometrical language, is
the discovery of irrationals. The solution of equations in numbers, for the Greek
this meant rational numbers, is no longer possible, and the Greeks would not settle
for approximate solutions. The geometrical solution is exact and generally appli-
cable” [20].
The classic inequality GM\AM states that the geometric mean GM is strictly
smaller than the arithmetic mean AM. That very same inequality forms the basis for
surface theory coupling intrinsic and extrinsic curvature of shapes. In its more
general form it is at the basis of most of our theories in physics that evolved in the
19th century starting with Euler and Gauss.
Today Euclidean geometry is less popular. With many new developments in the
19th and 20th century, Euclidean geometry became only one among many possible
geometries, linked to speciﬁc invariants. Its dominating position in education was
considered as a hindrance. “Euclid must go”, was stated by Jean Dieudonné (1906–
1992) towards new approaches for teaching mathematics in the mid 20th century
[21] (although Dieudonné clearly recognized that our current science is built on the
foundations that Ancient Greek mathematicians established).
However, Euclidean geometry remains the pillar of our mathematics and our
science. Some of the great mathematicians of the 20th century considered Euclidean
geometry as very central. René Thom (1923–2002) was, as usual, very outspoken:
“The dilemma posed all scientiﬁc explanation is this: magic or geometry. Classical
Euclidean geometry can be considered as magic; at the price of minimal distortion
of appearances (a point without size, a line without width) the purely formal
language of geometry describes adequately the reality of space. We might say, in
this sense, that geometry is successful magic” [9].
A.N. Alexandrov (1912–1999) contributed to mathematics under the slogan:
“Retreat to Euclid” [22, 23]. For him the pathos of contemporary mathematics is the
return to Ancient Greece and also in our view Euclidean geometry remains central.
In the case of relativity theory the Euclidean spaces had to be amended to include
Lorentz transformations and curved surfaces and manifolds. We will also amend the
rigidity of Euclidean geometry with appropriate transformations (in our case Gielis
transformations) but it will leave the core untouched. The title Geometrical beauty
of Plants refers to these ancient roots, whereby beauty refers to the harmony that
was so dear to the Greeks.
Mathematical Theories Versus Theories of Everything
When we consider a mathematical or geometrical theory of morphogenesis, we will
deal with mathematical propositions or “quantities of M-type” (axioms, assump-
tions, deﬁnitions and theorems). In general, symbols are used to form formulas and
equations, but many can be stated in words as well. Ancient Greek geometers stated
Commensurability, Symmetry and Euclidean Geometry
11

their propositions in words and in my opinion this is an excellent approach to
improve understanding. The Greek method of thinking in mathematics and general
logic or reasoning followed the same rules and in a certain way, they did not lack
symbols, but they mastered language. The rules of reasoning, according to Proclus
are the following:
Propositio or pqόsă ri1
Expositio or ἔjheri1
Determinatio or dioqirlό1
Constructio or jasarjetή
Demonstratio or ἀpόdeini1
Conclusio or rtlpέqarla
In the Determinatio step one investigates “whether what is sought is possible or
impossible, and how far it is practicable and in how many ways”. If we apply a
certain method, it would be good to investigate, how it ﬁts into existing ﬁelds or can
open new doors, in theory or practice. One important aspect is the existence of a
solution. From the 19th century onwards, such existence proofs became crucial in
mathematics, but for the Greek this was an absolutely normal step.
The mathematical quantities (M-type) are then compared to observations and
data from the ﬁelds of physics and biology, from chemistry or astronomy (O-type,
O standing for observations), to determine possible identiﬁcation between the two
types. In his book on general relativity theory George Yuri Rainich (1925–1968)
expressed this very precisely [24]: “If these relations coincide (within experimental
errors) with relations which appear to be accepted by physicists and astronomers,
we say that these last relations, or the experimental and observational facts
expressed by them, are explained on the basis of the mathematical theory: in some
cases when the relations stated in the formulas have not been observed prior to
their derivation, but are observed after, we speak of predictions that have been
veriﬁed. In both cases we speak of conﬁrmation of the theory of observation.
This in the author’s opinion is the nature of application of mathematics to
physics. It is not asserted that there always exists a theory explaining all the facts,
and it is not denied that there may exist at the same time two theories which explain
(within experimental errors) the known facts equally well. Thus neither uniqueness,
nor existence is claimed for a mathematical theory of physical phenomena. In this
respect it differs from the concept of truth held by some people. The question
whether there is such a thing as truth – questions of the type “What does actually
happen?” questions about “physical reality” – we do not consider in this book.”
In this book we do exactly the same, namely describing the transformations and
see in how many ways they may be applied to the study of nature, without pre-
tending, even not for the geometrical theory of morphogenesis, to work on a Theory
of Everything. As Leonard Euler taught us: “Although to penetrate into the intimate
mysteries of nature and thence to learn the true causes of phenomena is not allowed
to us, nevertheless it can happen that a certain ﬁctive hypothesis may sufﬁce for
explaining many phenomena” [25].

Towards a Geometrical Theory of Morphogenesis

When we refer to the notion of explaining, it means not only that we can
describe shapes up to a desired precision, but that the very mathematical theory
gives us the insight in why shapes are the way they are, or why planets follow their
elliptic trajectories. For now we refer to this as natural curvature conditions, related
to inequalities between intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of the shapes. As an
example, a hanging chain assumes the shape of a catenary realizing equality in the
inequality between GM and AM for two functions (ex and ex) in the lowest part of
the catenary, since both are 1. The arithmetic mean is the hyperbolic cosine function
cosh x ¼ 1
2 ex þ ex
ð
Þ which is the geometric representation of a hanging chain or
catenary.
With respect to ‘precise’ descriptions, it is noted that geometry helps us to
understand the heart of the matter. In his wonderful book On Growth and Form,
D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860–1948) wrote: “The mathematician knows
better than we do the value of an approximation. The child’s skipping rope is but an
approximation of Huyghens’ catenary curve – but in the catenary curve – lies the
gist of the matter” [26]. Such consideration should only be made after the identi-
ﬁcation step has been successfully made.
Quantities of O-Type
The quantities of O-type are our observations of natural shapes and phenomena,
qualitatively and quantitatively. It is important for us in three different ways. First,
Gielis Transformations were based on observations in nature, more speciﬁcally, of
ﬂowers of Hydrangea, and square or polygonal stems in plants. Later, various other
shapes were described by these transformations. From a mathematical point of view
our transformations can be used to describe natural shapes to any degree of pre-
cision required. Along the road identiﬁcations with other mathematical quantities,
formulae and equations were found, looking from many angles and viewpoints.
This corresponds to ﬁnding connections, and investigating “whether what is sought
is possible or impossible, and how far it is practicable and in how many ways”, our
Determinatio or dioqirlό1 step,
We may start from individual observations and identiﬁcations, or from the more
general theory. We will focus on the motives following the advice of Richard
Courant: “It has always been a temptation for mathematicians to present the
crystallized product of their thoughts as a deductive general theory and to relegate
the individual mathematical phenomenon into the role of an example. The reader
who submits to the dogmatic form will be easily indoctrinated. Enlightenment
however, must come from an understanding of motives: live mathematical devel-
opment springs from natural problems which can be easily understood, but whose
solutions are difﬁcult and demand new methods of more general signiﬁcance” [27].
Natural problems have been the major source of inspiration for mathematicians
since the very beginning. Pythagoras, Newton, Gauss, Riemann and Thom, to name
Mathematical Theories Versus Theories of Everything
13

a few, were mathematicians and natural philosophers and their mathematical work
was always very closely related to the desire to understand natural phenomena. This
is no different in our approach. This book will be about the geometrical and
mathematical strategies towards a geometrical theory of morphogenesis.
Here I must pause for a moment, since the strategies are somewhat different from
the motives. If I look at plants or natural shapes, I see, feel, smell and experience in
every aspect, their development and history. A walk in the park or a forest or a tree
nursery is a joy for the senses. Development from seeds or small cuttings to mature
plants and the actual presence of the plant, or the recurring seasonal developments
of leaves, ﬂowers and seeds as the manifestation of its recent past and the current
situation, with a magniﬁcent interaction between the plants and their environment,
the action of pollinators, organic and inorganic inﬂuences. I experience the energy
ﬂowing is this intelligent environment. This is the same for any living and
non-living being, form and shape, like the ever-changing forms of clouds or the
heavenly bodies, their future and past.
Above all my mind ﬁlls with a vision of a most beautiful symphony of life in
which rhythms and regularities are the base, and creativity and individuality the
actuality. Awe and wonder is the beginning—ἀqvή—of all science. Fortunately, a
wide variety of natural phenomena, symphonies and their most individual perfor-
mances may be described by our mathematical transformations. We can study stills
from nature (plants, ﬂowers…) or dynamic phenomena at all scales (time and
space). What motivates me is beauty and harmony, caused by awe and wonder
about the world we live in, in creatures great and small; what is described in this
book is only one language to make sense of this world I experience (Fig. 2.1).

Towards a Geometrical Theory of Morphogenesis

Secondly, identiﬁcations between M and O quantities must not rely solely on
visual analogy. The statement that Gielis transformations can describe natural and
abstract shapes with any required degree of precision cannot rely on a single or a
few observations, without actual measurements if we want to use it to study natural
shapes and phenomena.
While the origin of our transformations is found in modeling of square bamboos
(Chimonobambusa quadrangularis), in a wider setting, they must be coupled to
repeated and consecutive observations and measurements of natural phenomena
and shapes, under widely different conditions and in various closely or less closely
related species. Two examples are the modeling of tree rings, and leaves of
bamboo.
Thirdly, the very nature of observation is crucial. It has happened many times
that I showed shapes to fellow scientists, students, artists and laymen, who clas-
siﬁed shapes as round or circular, while they were demonstrably not round (the
water fern Marsilea in Fig. 2.2). It was only after showing what Lamé curves are
that they agreed it was not a circle, but rather a supercircle. To be sure, we have to
understand that the circle and rigid geometry is engrained in our minds to such an
extent that we may easily be bamboozled by our interpretations.
As one example, the snowﬂake in Fig. 2.2, would be recognized by many as a
truncated triangle, and Fourier analysis would give peaks on period three, but
retaining their hexagonal symmetry of ice such snowﬂakes are actually hexagons
with alternating long and short sides, in the same way as a rectangle is a square with
alternating short and long sides. For the record, this also relates to the algorithms
that we use for automated, so-called unbiased image recognition.

Quantities of M-Type for Natural Shapes
If we wish to study natural shapes and phenomena, it is necessary to agree on some
basic deﬁnitions and assumptions, many of which may be very different from what
we learned. In our approach of transformations, the notions of unit circle and
rigidity of rulers play a crucial role. Our Euclidean geometry is based on a
Euclidean circle, with all points on the circle at a ﬁxed distance from a ﬁxed center.
As humans we are free to roam in almost any direction (isotropy), and hence we can
easily deduce that if we walk in any direction we will arrive after the same interval
of time (“as the crow ﬂies”), at points that form a circle. This Euclidean circle is
based on our own observations of the world in which we are free to move, at least
ideally, and, with the straight line, is at the basis of most of our physical theories
and the geometrical tools used.
In the introduction to his book Minkowski Geometry [28], however, A.C.
Thompson writes: “Space to Euclid and Newton was uniform and “isotropic”, the
same in all directions. Such a notion ﬂies in the face of daily experience, where the
connotation of up and down is different from that of east to west. There are
preferred directions. Another good example is the preferred directions that cause
crystals to grow as polyhedra and not spherically like soap bubbles. Unit circles
and spheres are not the familiar round objects from Euclidean geometry, but are
some other convex shape, called the unit ball”.
The notion of unit circle or unit ball in nature can be very different from our
classic Euclidean circle. To mathematicians and many physicists the notion of
metrics and unit circles is well known, being the subject of Minkowski geometry,
but it is not (or hardly) known in biology. It is much better understood in crys-
tallography where the so-called Wulff shape provides the unit ball for a given
crystallographic conﬁguration, taking into account the molecular structure and the
directions of growth, like for example the snowﬂake. The shapes in Figs. 2.2. and
2.3 are unit circles, and circles in their own right, not deformed or non-circles. Such
unit balls introduce a natural anisotropy, with preferred directions of crystal growth.
Fig. 2.3 Some natural shapes as Gielis transformations of a circle

Towards a Geometrical Theory of Morphogenesis

The shapes we will discuss are unit circles (or unit spheres), with the Euclidean
circle (or sphere) as one special case. It is possible with our transformations to go
from a circle to a square or to a starﬁsh (and back) in a continuous way, and all such
shapes will remain unit circles. Likewise we can transform a sphere into a starﬁsh or
a pyramid (and back). Since it is continuous, we can describe the smallest possible
changes, to discern among many very similar natural objects, like leaves on a tree.
Objective Reality, Mathematics and the Mind’s Eye
Henri Poincaré wrote: “What we call objective reality, in ﬁnal analysis, is that what
is common between several students of this reality, and what could be common to
all. This common part cannot be anything else than the harmony expressed by
mathematical laws” [29]. These common parts and the mathematical laws may be
different in time, although one must take into account that essentially mathematics,
while subdivided in so many ﬁelds, has a great unity, especially in relation to the
descriptions and observations in nature. When we observe nature and build a mental
image to understand what we observe, we are doing science. A simple relation
between Ideas I (the mind’s eye), Mathematical quantities M (an abstraction of our
observations) and Observations O (what we see, feel, here, measure…) is given in
Fig. 2.4.
In our understanding we ascend from observing analogies and correspondence
(amakocia or Analogy), to a geometrization (cexlesqia or Geometry) and ﬁnally
to understanding the connection between intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics
(aqlomia or Harmony), the mathematical laws that govern “what dwells in the
world and the world in which we dwell” [26].
In the ﬁrst phase we observe analogies A between widely different phenomena,
from which we build a mathematical structure, that may further be enriched with
observations. In a subsequent phase a geometrical structure G like Euclidean
geometry allowed for many successful laws to describe nature. This mathematical-
geometrical structure and quantities allow us to match observations to mathematical
Fig. 2.4 Observing and understanding is a human endeavour

17

quantities (within experimental errors and statistical boundaries) or allow predic-
tions for certain observations. If observations do not correspond it may be necessary
to enlarge or change the desired mathematical structures, whereby in most cases
mathematical quantities already exist. Conic sections had been studied long before
Kepler and Galilei used them to develop a uniform description of trajectories of
stones and planets. Special and general relativity theory built on geometric struc-
tures and transformations that had been studied before in mathematics; they could
be applied readily so to speak.
There is a third phase as well, the phase of understanding, of harmonizing
H. This phase occurs when we understand how observations and mathematical laws
that describe phenomena well enough, connect whatever we know about the inner
structure of the phenomena and objects we observe, and their outer structure, i.e.
the way they relate to the world around them, or how they are embedded in the
world around them. Such understanding is found in the relation between intrinsic
and extrinsic characteristics of surfaces and manifolds, exempliﬁed in the local by
the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean between two principal curvatures in a
given point on the surface (The intrinsic nature of a surface or manifold is ﬁxed, but
the ultimate shape it will attain is dependent on the environment, the space in which
the manifold is embedded), or in the global by the Chern-Bonnett-Gauss theorem
which connects the total curvature of surfaces to the half-perimeter of a Euclidean
circle or p.
The great theories connect this internal and external, whether in mathematics,
physics or biology. The ﬁrst example is Newtonian theory where curvature of a
curve or a surface is correlated to a ﬁxed absolute space (see Schrödinger’s quote
earlier). The second example from physics is Special Relativity Theory, whereby
the physical interpretation by Einstein was the step to harmony (beyond the
mathematical use of Lorentz transformations by Lorentz and Poincaré). A ﬁxed
Newtonian frame with universal time was replaced by an internal postulate (con-
stancy of speed of light) and an external one (all laws of physics remain valid).
Once this harmony step is achieved, mathematicians and physicists (and biol-
ogists) can agree on what they consider (in a certain era) as objective reality, to
study everything that we can know or study. D’Arcy Thompson wrote: “So the
living and the dead, things animate and inanimate, we dwellers in the world and the
world in which we dwell—pάmsa ca lὰm sὰcicmxrjόlema—are bound alike by
physical and mathematical law” [26]. Everything we can know.
Also Alfred Wallace and Charles Darwin’s Theory of Natural Selection has the
same structure. The biologist Julian Huxley (1887–1975) wrote: “Darwin was
concerned both to establish the fact of evolution, and to discover the mechanism by
which it operated, and it was precisely because he attacked both aspects of the
problems simultaneously that he was so successful” [30]. Inherently organisms and
species want to develop and multiply (‘to their own image, but having the inherent
tendency for variation’), but in order to be successful, they have to survive in the
environment wherein they live. Neither the inherent nor the external conditions
were speciﬁed by Darwin, yet his theory proved extremely successful.

A New Pair of Glasses
In this book it will be argued that using semi-rigid rulers to study nature has great
value, due to the fact that the semi-rigidity allows us to deﬁne a continuous
transformation—the Gielis transformations—common to all the phenomena and
objects that we will discuss, both in mathematics and in the natural sciences. Our
current tools for the study of nature are mainly straight lines and circles, also for
studying squares and starﬁsh. We impose “our” geometry onto the study of nature.
Our current scientiﬁc methods are based on our own human perception of the
world. We can build models about nature and its shapes, but computational models
able to predict are not enough to understand nature; what is needed are dedicated
geometries with intrinsic natural anisotropy through dedicated semi-rigid trans-
formations. In particular, it will allow us to connect the isotropic with the aniso-
tropic. They will become interchangeable. This requires new pairs of glasses.
Kepler and Newton, Faraday and Maxwell, Poincaré, Lorentz and Einstein,
Wallace and Darwin, Mendel and Barbara McClintock [31, 32] offered us new pairs
of glasses to study nature, new ways of looking at certain natural phenomena and
shapes. Scientiﬁc progress is dependent on these glasses as mental instruments.
Once more René Thom: “Les progrès scientiﬁques sont toujours subordonnées à la
possibilité d’un instrument mental qui permette d’exprimer les correspondances,
les régularités des choses” [33]. All scientiﬁc progress depends on the availability
of a mental instrument that allows for expressing the commonalities, the regularities
of things. Description always precedes ideas about the real connection between
maths and nature.
Our transformations offer a new, geometric way of looking at nature. They are a
unique and uniform way of describing a wide variety of shapes as diverse as plant
cells, stems and ﬂowers, starﬁsh, crystals, galaxies and even the relativistic universe
itself. Through Gielis transformations curves, surfaces and (sub-) manifolds all
become commensurable or symmetrical as conic sections and Euclidean circles, in
the spirit of Greek and modern geometry. Besides providing a uniform description,
the major change in our point of view is that starﬁsh, crystals and trees will
experience the world in totally different ways than humans do, because they are
constrained in their way of moving through space and space-time, and hence, if
they would have the ability to abstract or geometrize their way of measuring, their
geometry of their world would be profoundly different. The unit circle of a starﬁsh
could well be a starﬁsh curve, not our circle.
My hope is, apart from contributing towards a geometric (technical) theory of
morphogenesis, that this book will further allow for a better understanding of the
deep relationships in nature, and that we can use these tools to agree on what
objective reality is, beyond anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism. This objec-
tive reality can indeed only exist if we accept the independence of observations by
organisms and natural objects.
We may hope to get a glimpse of the way other beings, living and non-living,
experience, geometrize, symmetrize and harmonize the world in which they live,

the One World in which we all live (Fig. 2.5). The plant geneticist Barbara
McClintock (1902–1992) wrote: “Basically everything is one. There is no way in
which you draw a line between things. What we normally do is to make these
subdivisions, but they are not real. Our educational system is full of subdivisions
that are artiﬁcial, that shouldn’t be there” [32].

We may picture the product of three thousand years of
geometric inventiveness in the form of a tree – the “Geometree”
whose roots go back even further and whose branches
represent the outcome of centuries of discovery and creation.
With or without application, the branches and fruits of this tree
are worth contemplating as a remarkable product of human
imagination. The Geometree is healthy, vigorous and in full
foliage, older than any redwood, and fully as majestic [34].

On Arithmetic and Geometric Means
Relations between arithmetic and geometric means will take center stage, so I
thought it not amiss to devote a complete chapter to point out the ancient roots of
these notions and the relations between seemingly disparate ﬁelds.
Exploring the inequality between geometric and arithmetic means is one of the
great achievements of the Greek mathematicians. This inequality GM\AM is the
corner stone of number theory, for positive numbers. It is related to the problem of
transforming a rectangle with sides a and b into a square with equal area (the sides
are then given by GM ¼ pab based on the product) or into a square with the same
circumference. In the latter case the side of the square is given by AM ¼ ða þ bÞ=2;
based on addition. These transformations are also the basis of conic sections and the
calculus, as will be shown in this chapter.
When also negative numbers are allowed this inequality can become equality,
for example in the product of two functions ex and ex. The product of these
functions is 1 for any x and so is the geometric mean GM. In only one of the points,
however, the geometric mean is equal to the arithmetic mean and that is the lowest
point. Indeed, the arithmetic mean of the two functions ex and ex is the hyperbolic
cosine coshðxÞ, and equal to one for x ¼ 0; One is also the value of the GM for
x ¼ 0. As coshðxÞ is the shape describing a hanging chain or catenary, equality in
the GM-AM inequality is achieved precisely in the lowest point of the chain.

When the catenary or hanging chain is revolved around the horizontal axis below
the chain, a catenoid results. This is the shape a soap ﬁlm assumes between two
rings, when these rings are pulled out of a soap solution. In this case all soap
molecules arrange themselves in such a way that not only is the stress evenly
distributed over the surface, but the stress is actually zero. This stress is measured in
each point on a surface by using the two principal curvatures, which are maximum
and minimum curvature (k1 and k2), and perpendicular. The product of k1 and k2 in
this point is the Gaussian curvature, which is the square of the GM. In surface
theory the GM-AM inequality is written as K  H2 whereby H is the arithmetic
mean of k1 and k2. For the catenoid both K and H are zero, as in the plane, the other
zero stress surface.
So, in the 18th and 19th century the ideas of Greek mathematicians were
gradually transformed into the cornerstone of geometry and physical realizations:
minimal surfaces.
The original deﬁnition of means by Greek mathematicians is based on ratios and
differences for three positive numbers a, b and c. If a > b > c, various means were
derived by studying the ratio of the differences ðabÞ
ðbcÞ, equal to the ratio of the
individual numbers. The arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means resulted when
the ratio of differences of numbers is equal to a
a ¼ b
b ¼ c
c ; a=b ¼ b=c and a=c
respectively. Our modern notations are different (e.g. GM is
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

) but the Greek
were interested in all combinatorial aspects of numbers and their ratios (Fig. 3.1).

On Derivatives and Nomograms for Means
Geometric and arithmetic means ﬁgure in various developments in science, not in
the least in the notion of derivatives. In On Proof and Progress in Mathematics
William Thurston [35] describes how people develop an “understanding” of
mathematics and he uses the example of derivatives, that can be approached from
very different viewpoints, allowing individuals to develop their own understanding
of derivatives.
The derivative can be thought of as:
(1)
Inﬁnitesimal: the ratio of the inﬁnitesimal change in the value of a function to the
inﬁnitesimal change in a function.
(2)
Symbolic: the derivative of xn ¼ n : xn1, the derivative of sinðxÞ is cosðxÞ, the
derivative of f o g is f′o g * g′, etc.
(3)
Logical: f′(x) = d if and only if for every e there is a d, such that when

The derivative of a real-valued function f in a domain D is the Lagrangian section of
the cotangent bundle T*(D) that gives the connection form for the unique ﬂat con-
nection on the trivial R-bundle D x R for which the graph of f is parallel.
Thurston provides this partial list of deﬁnitions, to illustrate how ‘individual’
understanding can differ: “One person’s clear mental image is another person’s
intimidation. Human understanding does not follow a single path, as a computer
with a central processing unit; our brains are much more complex and capable of
far more than a single path” [35]. We should not forget that it has taken mathe-
maticians thousands of years to come to a good understanding of the concept.
Focusing on deﬁnition (2) this reduces to a game of cubes and unit elements.
Essentially the game component of cubes and beams was very clear to mathe-
maticians from the 16th and 17th century, and many of the other different deﬁni-
tions of derivatives simply follow from these observations. The same procedure
underlies important special polynomials. Starting from geometric means, beams,
cubes and unit (or neutral) element, the relations between these various ﬁelds can
easily be shown.
To develop the argument we use a method proposed by Rik Verhulst, a Belgian
math teacher whose teaching methods attracted attention from international experts
[36–38]. It is a geometrical representation of the nth-arithmetic, nth-geometric and
nth-harmonic means. For n = 2 the geometric mean GM and arithmetic mean AM are

geometry in the sense that they are solutions to one of the oldest optimization
problems: For a given rectangle with sides a and b, AM between a and b is the side of
a square with the same perimeter as the given rectangle and GM between a and b is
the side of a square with the same area as the given rectangle with sides a and b.
Coefﬁcient n = 2 refers to the use of a square root in GM. In general on any straight
line, an interval [a, b] can be divided in 2 or more parts following the construction
in Fig. 3.2, where the number of intervals is n = 3 with the relations given by
the Eq. 3.1.

The intervals in the left graph show a composition of translations with itself. In
the case of GM the subsequent divisions deﬁne homothetic transformations. An
interval can be divided in n intervals with n = any natural number.
Also the inverse question can be asked: “Can x and y, z … be determined
graphically using only parallel lines?” This is straightforward in the case of AM but
impossible in the case of GM. However, a construction using only parallel lines
yields the harmonic mean HM which is the ratio between AM and GM (Fig. 3.3).

Geometric Means and Pascal’s Triangle
It is remarkable that these formulae can be generated with simple geometry and
algebra, represented in beautiful nomograms, without the sophisticated tools of
analysis. It is thus possible to understand various means of different order n geo-
metrically and algebraically [39]. The arguments over which the nth-root is taken
are also the various entries of Pascal’s Triangle wherein the normal rules of
arithmetic are encoded as expansions of ða þ bÞn: As can be observed, every pro-
duct between a and b in the Triangle is the argument of the geometric mean of some
order between numbers a and b (Fig. 3.4).
Fig. 3.4 First rows of
Pascal’s triangle

The link with derivatives is straightforward when we observe that in rows the
order decreases from n to 0, from left to right for a and increases for b in the same
direction. If we write 1a2 we understand at the same time that this is equal to b0a2
and applying the lowering rule to 1, x0 ! 0. In the one direction we have a
lowering of the exponent of a or b, in the other direction an increase according to
the following rules:
xn ! nxn1

The procedure with Eq. 3.4 is also known as derivation, deﬁnition (2) Symbolic.
Performing this in two directions and using proper normalization dividing by n! the
normal binomial coefﬁcients come out.
1a4 ! 4a3 ! 12a2 ! 24a1 ! 24

Multiplying term by term:
24a4

96a1b3
24b4
Adding all terms and dividing each term by n! ¼ 4!
1a4 þ 4a3b þ 6a2b2 þ 4ab3 þ b4
So, derivation can be understood directly from simple rules of arithmetic. Many
systems in science can be derived from this triangle, starting with the Binomium of
Newton, probability theory and combinatorics, the binary system, calculus and the
Punnett scheme in genetics.
Tossing a coin has very predictable average outcomes. In this case a and b can be
substituted by H(eads)/T(ails). Tossing a coin 3 times gives 23 = 8 possibilities,
starting with H3 = HHH up to T3 = TTT, with all combinations in between. Indeed,
we have a total of six ‘geometric means’ with three times a combination of two
H and one T (HHT, HTH, THH) and 3 possible combinations of two T and one
H (TTH, THT, HTT). The outcomes for tossing the coin any number of times n can
be read from Pascal’s Triangle.
The binary system, the basis of our information technologies, dates back to
Leibniz. The ﬁrst eight numbers of the binary system from 000 to 111 are obtained
by ð1 þ 0Þ3, i.e. any combination of three of 1’s and 0’s, namely 000, 001, 010,
100, 110, 101, 011, 111. Other binary numbers are found by using higher values of
the exponent.
The Punnett scheme in genetics for predicting the outcome of crosses with
independent genes has the same background. A monohybrid cross with alleles
28

A and a from maternal side and A and a from paternal side leads to the combi-
nations AA, aa and 2 times Aa. A dihybrid cross between two double heterozygous
parents and unlinked genes gives 16 possibilities in well speciﬁed ratios, given by
Pascal’s Triangle. In genetics, any other outcome would point to for example linked
genes. Mendel’s laws have a purely arithmetic basis, and for Mendel this felt most
natural.
The normal rules of arithmetic have been and still are at the basis of our scientiﬁc
revolutions. It can even be taken one (or several) step further: Sum the rows of the
triangle and make the coefﬁcients general [40]. Summing the ﬁrst three rows of the
triangles and substituting the coefﬁcients of the ﬁrst three rows by general coefﬁ-
cients A, B, C, D, E and F, gives the general form Ax2 þ Bxy þ Cy2 þ Dx þ Ey þ F.
When this sum equals zero we obtain the general form for conic sections and the
value of the discriminant ðB24ACÞ determines whether this deﬁnes a circle,
ellipse, parabola and hyperbola. It all feels very natural, indeed.
Geometrically: A Game of Cubes and Beams
Geometrically, each entry in a given nth row of Pascal’s Triangle has the same
dimension, and their sum is equal to ða þ bÞn. The fourth row for example, consists
of cubes with side a and b (and respective volumes a3 and b3, one of each), beams
with sides a, a and b (and volume a2b, three of them) and beams with sides a, b and
b (and volume ab2, also three of them).
Any row in the Triangle contains pure n-cubes an and bn (Fig. 3.4, numbers in
bold) on the one hand, and n-beams on the other hand (Fig. 3.4), whose sum is
equal to a hypercube ða þ bÞn. Hypercubes or n-cubes are n-dimensional cubes
(with n > 3, with side a or b), hyperbeams or n-beams are n-dimensional beams
(with n > 3) of which at least one side is different from all other sides (for example
anbm) (Fig. 3.5).
What is not known is that it is very easy to turn beams like anbm of dimension
ðn þ mÞ into cubes of the same dimension. For each hyperbeam anbm one can
construct a hypercube with the same volume by taking the ðn þ mÞth root of anbm,
which gives the side of the ðn þ mÞ-dimensional cube. This is the procedure dis-
cussed earlier, on geometric means of a particular order, all of the same dimension.
More speciﬁcally for GMi/n between two numbers a and b, we specify i, n, a and
b (either a and b can be 1)

So we can think about these numbers as geometric numbers. Simon Stevin
(1548–1620) reasoned and thought about geometric numbers (Fig. 3.6). Stevin was
Geometric Means and Pascal’s Triangle
29

one of the greatest mathematicians of the 16th century and his work was both of a
pure and applied nature providing a bridge between the old and the new sciences.
His equilibrium of forces and the parallelogram rule should be considered as the
beginning of abstract algebra and of higher dimensional geometry [41–47].
In Fig. 3.6 examples are given of the powers of 2 (upper row) and the powers of
1 (lower row). 23 is a cube, and 24 ð¼ 16Þ are two cubes of the size 23. Likewise
25 ð¼ 32Þ are four of those cubes. For a cube with all sides equal to 1, the results
remain the same for any power. It is the neutral element and any number of
multiplications of 1 by itself always yields the same result.
An object like b4 (arithmetically the product b  b  b  b) can be understood geo-
metrically in many different ways. The object b4 is not only a four-dimensional
volume of a hypercube with side b, but it is also b times a three-dimensional volume
b3 (side of this cube is b). At the same time it can be seen as bb times an area of b2, but
b2 could also be interpreted as a beam of volume 1 : b2. This beam can then be made
into a cube with the same volume, but with side 1 : b2
ð
Þ1=3, the one-third geometric
mean between b2 and 1, or the second geometrical mean of 1 and b. We have:

And so on. For the four-dimensional volume, it is important to be reminded how
Pascal thought about the fourth dimension: “Et l’on ne doit pas être blessé par cette
quatrième dimension” [48]. Intelligent people should not be put off by something
like the fourth dimension, because in reality it is about multiplication.
A contemporary of Stevin, François Viète (1540–1603) prefers to deal exclu-
sively with numbers avoiding all geometrical connotations. In his “Logistices
speciosae canonica praecepta” [49] (canonical rules of species calculation), the
main law (Lex homogeneorum) states that only species of the same kind (homo-
geneous species) can be added or subtracted. In a typical row of Pascal’s Triangle,
all n-cubes and n-beams are of the same dimension or the same species (speciosa),
but in general polynomials (for example in one variable x4 þ x3 þ x), this is not the
case and here the Lex homogeneorum rules, according to “common sense”, which
forbids us to add a hypercube, a cube and a line. This “in fact-not-so-common-
sense” is one of the main reasons for the split between arithmetic and geometry.
Contrary to Viète’s Lex homogeneorum however, it is very easy to get the same
dimension for any term of a polynomial using the unit element. For example, a
polynomial like x4 þ x3 þ x can be written as ðx  x  x  xÞ þ ðx  x  x  1Þ þ
ðx  1  1  1Þ; all of the same dimension and actually, all geometric means of dif-
ferent orders between x and the unit element 1 can be written as

The Decimal Principle and Fluxions
All this was very natural for mathematicians like Simon Stevin and his contem-
poraries. The relation between products and rectangles was frequently used for
didactical reasons, for example by John Colson in his “perpetual comment” to
Newton’s “Method of Fluxions and inﬁnite series - To which is subjoin’d: A per-
petual comment upon the whole work, consisting of annotations, illustrations and
supplements in order to make this treatise A Compleat Institution for the use of
learners” [50].
This treatise brings out a nice historical connection between Stevin and Newton,
going back to the complete arithmetical treatment with natural numbers by Stevin in
the decimal system in 1585. Stevin showed in his book De Thiende [51] that a
complete arithmetical control of the real number system is achieved by explicitly
demonstrating how all operations on and with real numbers can be carried out when
expressing these numbers in the decimal system. As Bartel van der Waerden wrote
in his History of Algebra: “With one stroke, the classical restrictions of “numbers”
to integers or to rational fractions was eliminated. Stevin’s general notion of a real
number was accepted by all later scientists” [52]. Stevin added in an appendix to
De Thiende that the decimal principle should be advocated in “all human accounts
and measurements”, thereby anticipating the (partial) realization of this simple idea
by two centuries.
Another deﬁnition of Stevin in his L’ Arithmétique, is deﬁnition XXVI
“Multinomie algebraique est un nombre consistent de plusieurs diverses quantitez”
[41]. This deﬁnition introduces the reader to algebraic multinomials or polynomials.
This deﬁnition allowed polynomials to be treated as numbers and to be used in
normal arithmetic operations. Stevin was the ﬁrst to realize that code could be
treated as data [53].
The importance of the decimal principle and multinomials for geometry and for
science cannot be overemphasized. It paved the way for Descartes’ algebraic
geometry and inspired Newton to write his Method of Fluxions and inﬁnite series
[54] with its application to the geometry of curve-line from the following
motivation:
Since there is a great conformity between the Operations in Species, and the same
Operations in common Numbers; nor do they seem to differ, except in the Characters by
which they are presented, the ﬁrst being general and indeﬁnite, and the other deﬁnite and
particular: I cannot but wonder that no body has thought of accommodating the
lately-discover’d Doctrine of Decimal Fractions in like manner to Species, …, especially
since it might have open’d a way to more abstruse Discoveries. But since this Doctrine of
Species, has the same relation to Algebra, as the Doctrine of Decimal Numbers has to
common Arithmetick: the Operations of Additions, Subtractions, Multiplication, Division
and the Extraction of Roots, may easily be learned from thence, if the Learner be but skilled
in Decimal Arithmetick, and the Vulgar Algebra, and observes the correspondence that
obtains between Decimal Fractions and Algebraick Terms inﬁnitely continued. For as in
Numbers, the Places towards the right-hand continually decrease in a Decimal or
Subdecuple Proportion; so it is in Species respectively, when the Terms are disposed in an
uniform Progression inﬁnitely continued, according to the Order of the Dimensions of any
32
3

Numerator or Denominator. And as the convenience of Decimals is this, that all vulgar
Fractions and Radicals, being reduced to them, in some measure acquire the nature of
Integers, and may be managed as such, so it is a convenience attending inﬁnite Series in
species, that all kinds of complicate Terms may be reduced to the Class of simple
Quantities…
One of the major developments in the book concerns inﬁnite series. John Colson
(1680–1760) who later became Lucasian professor of Mathematics, as one of the
successors of Barrow and Newton, wrote in his Introduction: “As to the Method of
Inﬁnite Series, in this the Author opens a new kind of Arithmetick, (new at least at
the time of writing this), or rather he vastly improves the old. For he extends the
received Notation, making it completely universal and shews, that as our common
Arithmetick of Integers received a great improvement by the introduction of deci-
mal Fractions; so the common Algebra or Analyticks, as an universal Arithmetick,
will receive a like Improvement by the admission of his Doctrine of Inﬁnite Series,
by which the same analogy will be still carry’d on, and farther advanced towards
perfection. Then he shews how all complicate Algebraical Expressions may be
reduced to such Series, as will continually converge to the true values of those
complex quantities or their Roots, and may be therefor be used in their stead” [50].
Such series also form a positional system. In Taylor series the same rules Dxn ¼
n : xn1 are key. They give an operational deﬁnition of functions with for example,
the series for ex; cos x; sin x. This is shown in Fig. 3.7 for sin x.

The key to understanding derivatives is putting the unit element back where it
belongs [39]. A neutral element is an element that does not inﬂuence the outcome
(for multiplication this is the unit element), but derivatives demand the substitution
of the variable by the unit element. Indeed, performing derivation is substituting
x by 1, one at the time in a series. In Eq. 3.6 in the process of derivation (e.g. of x3)
we observe x3 ¼ x : x : x ! 3 x : x : 1
ð
Þ ¼ 3x2. One cube of x3 is compared to beams
of sides x, x and 1, and we need three of them.
So, if we want to ﬁnd the derivative of ex we substitute in every term of the series
one factor x by 1 (and if there is no x as in the ﬁrst term it becomes 0; the “lowering
of the exponent operation”) and put the original exponent up front lowering n! to
ðn  1Þ!. The result is the same series, as expected. It is easy to show that the same
occurs if we use the series expansions for sine and cosine, based on the relationship
of Euler; D sinx
ð
Þ ¼ cos x and Dðcos xÞ ¼  sin x.
In general, derivatives are related to (higher order) geometric means between
two numbers f and e. Higher order geometric means between two pure numbers
f and e involve expressions of the type ðm þ nÞth root of f m : en and for e ¼ 1 :
f 3 þ f 2 þ f 1 þ 1 can be written as f :f :f þ f :f :e þ f :e:e þ e:e:e (Fig. 3.8). Geometry
is the best way to understand derivatives, and the rules of derivation. The derivative
of a product D x : y
ð
Þ can easily be understood by drawing a rectangle with sides
x þ dx and y þ dy: Computing the area of that rectangle gives you the exact rule,
which according to Vladimir Arnold is impossible to understand from the rules of
Leibniz.

The Geometry of Parabolas and Allometric Laws
The use of the unit element allows for comparing n-volumes (converting m volumes
into n-volumes of the ‘same’ dimension if needed). This, in our view, also shows
that the Greeks were well aware of “units” in relation to conic sections. In a
parabola y ¼ x2, the variable y scales to the ﬁrst power while some other variable
x scales to the second, but geometrically a parabola indicates that for each coor-
dinate x, one can construct (in Greek terminology to each line with length x it is
possible to apply) a square with area equal to x2, such that this area corresponds
exactly to the area of a rectangle with width 1 and height y ðx : x ¼ y : 1Þ. In this
sense the parabola is an equiareal ﬁgure, a geometric tool for comparing equal areas
of different ﬁgures [39]. This was known to Ancient Greek geometers and is at the
basis of the conic sections.
The parabola and conic sections are based on squares, but we need not stop here.
We can raise the variables to any number. Such generalized parabola’s were studied
in the Renaissance, for example Neil’s Parabola with y ¼ x2=3 and such higher order
parabolas are directly connected to power laws (Fig. 3.9).
Allometric equations or power laws are generally depicted as straight lines in
log-log plots, but can be understood in the same geometric way, namely that these
equations express some conservation law for n-volumes of n-cubes and n-beams,
with the parabola and hyperbola for n = 2. The power law y ¼ x3=4 or equivalently
y4 ¼ x3 thus states that the 4-cube with side y is exactly the same as the 4-beam
with four sides x; x; x and 1 (with volume x  x  x  1). Or y : y3 ¼ x3: One can build
a scale with equal arm length, with on one side y cubes of y3 and on the other 1
cube of x3. Or one could choose one cube of each, and then the length of the arms
stands in a ratio 1 to y.
An example from physics is Kepler’s Law of Periods, which states that the
square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the
semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit. So the volume of a beam formed by the
orbital period T1 and the unit element is T1 : T1 : 1
½
 (i.e. the volume of a beam with
height and length T1 and width 1), equals the volume of a cube a1 : a1 : a1
½
 (with
sides equal to the semi-major axis a1) up to a constant. On a weighing balance this
constant can be interpreted as the length of the arms. This is also an equiareal law,
like the law of equal areas (Fig. 3.10).

Just as in the solar system, power laws are ubiquitous in living organisms, in
so-called allometric equations, expressing the constancy of relative growth [26, 57,
58]. For example, across a broad spectrum of aquatic and terrestrial species (in-
cluding algae, horsetails, shrubs, trees…) annual growth in plant body biomass per
individual GT is proportional to the ¾ power of the total body mass per individual

balance considerations, a differential equation (the WBE equation) yielding the
evolution of biological masses [59]. Any biological evolving complex, follows the
logistic paradigm contained in this WBE equation, namely exponential growth and
saturation. Allometric laws are ubiquitous in natural systems.
In our days y ¼ x3=4 is related often to “fractal dimensions”, but these are
parabola’s of the type yn ¼ xn1, more speciﬁcally y ¼ x3=4 , y4 ¼ x3. Or
y : y : y : y ¼ x : x : x : 1: (Fig. 3.9) Parabola means precise ﬁtting. This in our opinion
at least, settles the question whether the Greeks understood derivatives and
dynamics in a positive way. It is all about geometric means, which they understood
very well.

Sine and cosine are examples of simple polynomials, but in mathematics there
are a large number of special polynomials in the theory of special functions, such as
Legendre, Chebyshev, Hermite, Jacobi, and Laguerre polynomials. The Chebyshev
polynomials (Fig. 3.12) have a very close relationship to circular trigonometric
functions and trigonometric identities. Special functions play a crucial role in
various ﬁelds of mathematics, physics and engineering and during the last decades
new families of special functions have been suggested in various branches of

physics. In biology Special Functions are rarely used (but this will change, as we
will show that certain special functions are rooted ﬁrmly in the relation between
botany and geometry).
Comparing many such special functions and their explicit form in contemporary
pure and applied mathematics to functions of a more elementary nature (ex, sine,
cosine….) from the 17th and 18th century seems somewhat like jumping from
older, simpler deﬁnitions of the derivative (Thurston’s list 1 through 7) to deﬁnition
37. Indeed, at ﬁrst sight contemporary special polynomials are a far cry from the
simpler functions and power series, from parabolas and cubes and beams. But is
that so?
Most families of special polynomials can be transformed by the same simple
procedure of raising and lowering exponents, the same game of means and beams.
By virtue of the so-called monomiality principle, all families of polynomials, and in
particular special polynomials, can be obtained by transforming a basic monomial
set by means of suitable operators P and M, called the derivative and multiplication
operator of the considered family, respectively. The deﬁnition of the poweroid
introduced by J.F. Steffensen, has been recently framed in the so-called monomi-
ality principle by Giuseppe Dattoli, resulting in a very powerful analytical tool for
deriving properties of special polynomials [60–63].
The simplest application of the monomiality principle regards the family of
monomials
xn
f
g in one variable with derivative and multiplication operators
P ¼ D ¼ d=dx and M ¼ x respectively, such that
P; M
½
 ¼ 1 and M xn
ð
Þ ¼
xn þ 1; P xn
ð
Þ ¼ nxn1. These operations simply consist in raising and lowering the
exponents of the general monomial belonging to the family. Additional relations are
given by x0 ¼ 1 and Dx0 ¼ 0 (One can easily see that it is also possible to start
from the antiderivative). The series discussed above are immediate consequences.
Using the monomiality principle, the analytical properties of special polynomials
can be easily studied. Following this approach, the governing differential equation,
recurrence relations and identities can be easily determined. All is based on the very
same method of turning rectangles into squares, using basic operations and func-
tions, and all is linked to simple rules of arithmetic and geometric imagination and
intuition.
A Way of Thinking…
It is important to understand concepts in different ways. Thurston’s list [35] is “a
list of different ways of thinking about or conceiving of the derivative, rather than a
list of different logical deﬁnitions.” It is important to be able to look at concepts, for
which mathematicians spent thousands of years to come to an ever-better under-
standing, from very different perspectives, not only tailored to speciﬁc talents of
individuals, but to safeguard the true spirit of mathematics. Thurston again: “Unless
great efforts are made to maintain the tone and ﬂavor of the original human
38

insights, the differences start to evaporate as soon as the mental concepts are
translated into precise, formal and explicit deﬁnitions.” One example is the
development of algebra and its deviation from geometric numbers.
The examples of parabola and ellipse show that the Greeks understood the unit
element in a general way, not necessarily as a number. Simon Stevin was one of the
ﬁrst to state that the unit was a number “Que l’Unité est Nombre” [41]. It becomes
the neutral element for multiplication, but it certainly does not need to be “one”, as
long as the element selected is “neutral”. We can understand differentials in the
same way. If we look back at Fig. 3.2, and move the point zero as far as possible to
the left, and deﬁne a unit element close to zero, this element becomes as far as
possible removed from a and b, having the least possible inﬂuence for computing
AM or GM.
One can call such an inﬁnitely small number for example “dx”. Obviously, one
does not need to move zero; easier is to move the unit element as close as possible
to zero. The ‘rectangles’ xdx in Riemann sums for integrals are a generalization of
parabolas, but viewed from a Greek’s geometrical perspective, it does not add
anything really new. The question whether dx ¼ 0 or 1 then becomes pretty irrel-
evant. It needs to be neutral in multiplication (in which case dx ¼ 1), and if it needs
to be neutral for addition ðx þ dxÞ it has the tendency to be rather close to zero.
From Fig. 3.2 (GM and AM for n = 2) one understands that the geometric mean
(GM) is strictly smaller than the arithmetic mean (AM). In order for AM to approach
GM, the point 0 where the lines cross has to be moved as far to the left as possible.
Equality is obtained only in the events when lines run parallel (with the crossing
points of the lines situated inﬁnitely far). This is an arithmetical interpretation of
Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate [64], which has always been considered as having a special
status amongst the postulates (Fig. 3.13).
The ﬁfth postulate states that “If a straight line falling on two straight lines
makes interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight
lines, if produced indeﬁnitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than
two right angles”. An alternative is Playfair’s axiom: “In the plane there is one and
only one line that goes through a given point A and is parallel to a given line a,
where A is not located on a”.
From a Greek perspective the ﬁfth postulate ensures that the arithmetic mean AM
and the geometric mean GM can be constructed. For positive numbers, based on the
geometrical construction of lines that necessarily intersect for any number smaller
than inﬁnity, GM is strictly smaller than AMðGM\AMÞ, which is the cornerstone
of our positive number system. It is an illustration of Chern’s remark that “Euclid’s
Elements are a geometrical treatment of the number system”. In the 19th century
this famous inequality was applied to surface theory, with ramiﬁcations from
minimal surfaces to space-time models.

The formal patterns underlying various means, the normal rules of arithmetic,
expansions and special functions are in fact a game of cubes and beams, going back
to Greek foundations (−1, −2, −3 is counting down to some time, say −2500 years,
when Pythagoreans mastered means, numbers and much more.) With simple
principles and elementary functions we can achieve already a very good under-
standing of mathematics and the relations among various ﬁelds. Newton’s intuition
(“if the Learner be but skilled in Decimal Arithmetick, and the Vulgar Algebra…”),
is still accurate today, but incomplete. Basic geometry is also required for a better
and more ﬂexible understanding. To understand higher dimensional cubes and
beams as simple geometric numbers, cubes, beams and balances in equilibrium, lifts
the ban imposed by François Viète in the 17th century.
It is absolutely forbidden to add the cube x3 to the square x2, or to the line x. Up
to this very day students are drilled and the ban continues to exist. Even Stephen
Hawking maintains on La Géometrie of Descartes: “At the time this was written a2
was commonly considered to mean the surface of a square whose side is a, and b3
to mean the volume of a cube whose side is b3 while b4, b5…. were unintelligible as
geometric forms.”
Not only are n-cubes with side a intelligible but an itself carries a lot of valuable
geometric information [65]. The coefﬁcients of the binomial expansion of ð2x þ 1Þn
do
have
a
nice
geometrical
meaning.
For
example,
the
tesseract,
the
four-dimensional cube ðx4Þ is composed of 16 points, 32 lines, 24 squares, 8 cubes
and of course 1 tesseract. Again, this is a nice example of lowering of exponents
with a clear geometrical meaning: ð2x þ 1Þ4 ¼ 16x4 þ 32x3 þ 24x2 þ 8x þ 1: The
expansions of 0’s and 1’s can be used as coordinates of the 16 vertices, with one
vertex centered at 0000.
René Descartes (1596–1650) certainly knew about the works of Simon Stevin
(1548–1620), not only because they were available in French, but also because of
his collaboration with Isaac Beeckman, himself a student of Simon Stevin. The
mathematical trinity of algebra, geometry and analysis was understood very well in
ancient Greece, where geometry forms the core and the soul. Greek and Hellenistic
mathematics and science were advanced in every sense of the word. The rebirth of
Eudoxus mathematical ﬁndings into Dedekind’s cut for deﬁning real numbers is
one example. Euclid’s Elements are a geometrical treatment of the number system.
The inﬂuence of Stevin’s Decimal fractions on the development of ﬂuxions has

correspondence to the

been pointed out, but this was really based on this very same idea of commensu-
rability. As D.J. Struik (editor of the mathematical parts of the Principal Works of
Simon Stevin) writes: “In his arithmetical and geometrical studies, Stevin pointed
out that the analogy between numbers and line-segments was closer than was
generally recognized. He showed that the principal arithmetical operations, as well
as the theory of proportions and the rule of three, had their counterparts in
geometry. Incommensurability existed between line-segments as well as num-
bers……..; incommensurability was a relative property, and there was no sense in
calling numbers “irrational”, “irregular”, or any other name, which connoted
inferiority. He went so far as to say, in his Traicté des incommensurables gran-
deurs, that the geometrical theory of incommensurables, in Euclid’s Tenth Book
had originally been discovered in terms of numbers, and translated the content of
this book into the language of numbers. He compared the still incompletely
understood arithmetical continuum to the geometrical continuum already explained
by the Greeks, and thus prepared the way for that correspondence of numbers and
points on the line that made its entry with Descartes’ coordinate geometry” [41].
Stevin is highly appreciated in the well-educated part of the scientiﬁc commu-
nity, but despite his manifold original contributions Stevin is less well known than
other scientists of this period. George Sarton, a great historian of science wrote:
“His greatness is conspicuous and not only in a single domain but in many…. How
could people truly admire one whom they do not understand, how could they
consider great a man whose greatness they have not yet been educated to appre-
ciate?” [43]
In some sense, all we are doing is adding some commas and punctuations here
and there to what the Greeks have done. Also on the historical side much is to be
learned from Plato (that all knowledge is remembrance) and Bacon (that all novelty
is but oblivion). One example of such oblivion and “novelty” are the series
expansions for cosine and sine, as well as their deﬁnitions, traditionally associated
with names of 16th and 17th century Western mathematicians. Trigonometric
functions sine and cosine, as well as their expansions, were already known to the
Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagramma (c. 1340–1425) in the early
15th century. Pascal’s Triangle was not invented by Pascal, but was known long
before in China and Persia [66]. Much of the mathematical, scientiﬁc and tech-
nological legacy of Ancient Hellas has been forgotten as well [67]. Many special
polynomials were invented a century ago and then forgotten, until rediscovered by
physics [68]. We should never forget that the history of mathematics is very old and
its legacy extremely rich, transcending boundaries in space and time.

Lamé Curves and Surfaces
The superellipse has the same beautiful unity as circle and
ellipse but is less obvious and less plain. The superellipse frees
us from the straightjacket of simpler curves such as lines and
planes.
Piet Hein
On Landscapes and Maps
Two of the deﬁning characteristics of Greek legacy are rational thinking, and the
notion that mathematics has an intimate relationship to the workings of the world.
According to Pythagoras, Everything is Number (and for Pythagoras geometry and
number were inextractably linked). According to Richard Feynman (1918–1988):
“To those who do not know mathematics it is difﬁcult to get across a real feeling as
to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature … If you want to learn about nature, to
appreciate nature, it is necessary to understand the language that she speaks in.
She offers her information only in one form” [69]. Fortunately, simple rules are a
basic feature of this language, by whatever name they are known, addition and
multiplication, means, cubes or the monomiality principle.
Despite the simple basic rules contemporary mathematics has evolved into very
diverse landscapes, in pure and applied mathematics or in theoretical physics. Each
uses one or more very speciﬁc high-level (increasingly abstract) languages, with
various local dialects. A mathematical concept like curvature goes under a variety
of different names in mathematics and physics, depending on the ﬁeld. There is the
imminent danger of high-level languages for different landscapes (the languages as
the maps or des Cartes), taking precedence over these landscapes and territories
themselves.
When it can be shown that simple rules underlie different mathematical land-
scapes, the general language (the art of mapmaking) need not be too abstract for a
basic understanding or the development of a certain deeper feeling for the matter.
Geometry rises to glory here. The “maps” we spoke of are based on the
Pythagorean Theorem or triangles in general (including triangulation of surfaces),

and geometric means between numbers. The application of the normal rules of
arithmetic leads to Pascal’s triangle and beyond. One ‘beyond’ example are conic
sections resulting from summing the ﬁrst rows of the series.
In our Pythagorean world, based on the above rules of arithmetic, there is a clear
difference between circles and square. Or polygons. We recall that for modeling
natural shapes and phenomena, the geometric means are given preference, and the
pure numbers an; bn or, more generally xn; yn become “negligible”.
In any row of Pascal’s Triangle, the likelihood of encountering pure numbers—
the left an and the rightmost bn entries of any row—is not high, and they have little
inﬂuence on the whole of the phenomena. If you throw a coin one hundred times
there is always, however small, a possibility that this will result in one hundred
consecutive heads, or one hundred consecutive tails. However, such events are very
unlikely to happen, and for higher values of n even extremely unlikely. Pure
numbers can de facto be neglected, or serve as a unit, having as little inﬂuence as
possible.
The genius of Pythagoras was that he did not use geometric means to deﬁne the
circle on the basis of the rectangular triangle, having a “pure number” equation
a2 þ b2 ¼ c2 for the rectangular triangle, or x2 þ y2 ¼ R2 for a circle, neglecting any
geometric means of the type xy or ab. We could now do exactly the same for all
rows of the Triangle. Instead of neglecting pure numbers an; bn, they will form the
basis of a different kind of geometry or calculus. If we think in this opposite
direction, we use only the pure numbers and neglect all geometric means. Take any
row in the Triangle, single out the outermost values, the pure numbers and neglect
all the rest. The binomial formula x þ y

. The part between
brackets is now neglected, and we get a kind of modulo form: xn þ yn modulo
geometric means. ða þ bÞn ¼ an þ bn modulo n is well known in number theory
[70].
Gabriel Lamé effectively introduced the curves xn þ yn ¼ Rn into geometry
[8, 71]. These curves include square, circles, asteroids, and many more. Lamé’s
motivation was the description of crystals in the framework of (Cartesian) geom-
etry. “Cependant, pour prouver que l’Analyse de Descartes n’est pas incapable de
traiter une des plus belles applications du calcul à la Géometrie, je vais indiquer la
marche que l’on pourrait prendre. Si je réussis à donner une analyse simple et
facilement applicable, je m’applaudirai d’avoir fait rentrer sous le domaine d’un
calcul qui doit être général, un sujet qui semblait le fuir”. With the curves named
after him, Gabriel Lamé developed a simple yet very general method, based on the
higher order binomials or trinomials. In this way he proved that one of the most
beautiful applications of calculus in geometry—crystallography—was possible
within the framework of Descartes’ geometry.
The original motivation of Gabriel Lamé was to open the analytic geometry of
Descartes for the description of crystals, of various shapes and symmetries, with
44

sharp corners. He remarked that even if his calculus would be difﬁcult, nothing
could be argued against the general applicability. Quite a foresight: since the 1990s
we know that such superelliptical shapes exist everywhere in nature. We ﬁnd
supercircles everywhere in nature now, from square bamboos to tree rings, from
leaves to ﬂowers, from crystals to galaxies, as single shapes and as signatures of
networks. Many examples will be shown in the next chapters. A further general-
ization in polar coordinates is the Gielis Formula (extending superellipses to dif-
ferent symmetries under the name superformula), the subject of this book, widening
the applicability of Lamé’s ideas, and at the same time providing simple compu-
tational methods.
Here is an important message: We have now seemingly two very different,
antagonistic, opposite strategies for studying natural shapes and phenomena, one
using geometric means (the classical approach, giving information about the pop-
ulation and the averages), the other one using only pure numbers (Lamé and
Pythagorean style separation of variables, giving information about very individual
instances; in fact, any particular instance of any sequence of a’s and b’s is equally
rare). But, these two views are not mutually exclusive. (My favorite and) rationally
the most efﬁcient way is to state that these two ways are complementary, they are
dual.
Lamé Curves and Surfaces
Circles and ellipses, as well as squares and rectangles (Fig. 4.1) are all included in
the family of Lamé curves introduced by Gabriel Lamé in 1818, deﬁned by
xn þ yn ¼ Rn. More speciﬁcally they are all instances of superellipses; these are the
planar curves given by Cartesian equations of the form:
x
A


n
þ y
B


n
¼ 1;
ð4:1Þ
where n is an integer and A and B are positive real numbers. For A = B, the (super)
ellipses become (super)circles. In Fig. 4.2, it is shown how Lamé curves are
dependent on the exponents being odd or even. The absolute values in superellipses
ensure the symmetry in the four quadrants.
This equation can generate a variety of shapes including circles, supercircles,
squares and astroids (for A = B), and superellipses and rectangles. All these shapes
differ in 3 parameters at most. “Superellipses” is a general name for these shapes,
but more speciﬁcally subellipses are inscribed in an ellipse, while superellipses
circumscribe the ellipse. Likewise subcircles are inscribed in a circle, and super-
circles circumscribe a circle. A and B give the size of the circle (for A ¼ B) or the
ellipse (for A 6¼ B) and the exponent n then transforms this circle or ellipse into
other shapes (Fig. 4.1).
On Landscapes and Maps
45

The names sub- and superellipses suggest that the ellipse with exponent n ¼ 2 is
the central shape, but an inscribed square for n = 1 is in fact the shape which
divides the area of a circumscribing square in two equal parts and is the exact
boundary for exponent n and 1=n (Fig. 4.1). Inside the inscribed square, the
exponent n\1 (e.g. the red zones in Fig. 4.1), while outside the inscribed square
n [ 1 (e.g. the dark blue zones in Fig. 4.1).
In its most general form, Lamé curves are deﬁned as xn þ yn ¼ zn. Without
absolute values Lamé curves also provide for a unifying description of conic sec-
tions [72]:

For the description of natural forms (Fig. 4.3) closed shapes are necessary, hence
the use of absolute values in Eq. 4.1.

Traditionally the exponents in Lamé-Euzet curves and surfaces are integers or
rational numbers, in line with algebraic curves and equations. Using irrational or real

From Barrow to Lamé
Gabriel Lamé (1795–1870) started studying at the Ecole Polytechnique in 1817, a
famous school with teachers like Gaspard Monge, Laplace and Lagrange. In 1818
he wrote a small but inﬂuential booklet on methods in geometry: Examen de
différentes méthodes employées pour résoudre les problèmes de géométrie [8]. In
the ﬁnal part he introduced the equations of plane and lines for the analytic geo-
metrical description of crystals, giving a geometrical foundation to the work of
Abbé Haüy, the founder of crystallography. It is then, in the ﬁnal pages of his book,
that Lamé generalizes this to
x
A
 m þ
y
B
 m¼ 1, for m integer.
With the deﬁnition of Lamé curves, Gabriel Lamé gave a very elegant repre-
sentation of curves that were no longer different individual curves. Henceforth,
circle and square, ellipse and rectangle, sphere and cube or cylinder differed in one
or a few parameters at most. A whole family of curves and surfaces was deﬁned by
one equation, that was a ‘multidimensional’ version of the Pythagorean Theorem,
deﬁning n-cubes and n-beams.

Lamé’s work obviously built on earlier researchers. In the 17th century Pierre de
Fermat (1601–1665) and Gregory Saint-Vincent (1584–1667) generalized para-
bola’s y ¼ xn and hyperbola’s y ¼ x

n to determine areas under curves. Power laws
deﬁned by power functions y ¼ x
m
n are ubiquitous in all ﬁelds of science and
technology and are geometrically described by superparabola’s. Fermat also studied
various related equations, esp. the one known from the Last Theorem of Fermat,
which states that for xn þ yn ¼ zn it is impossible for x, y, z and n to be all >2 and all
integer. Felix Klein (1932): “the assertion of Fermat means now that these curves,
unlike the circle, thread through a dense set of the rational points without passing
through a single one, except those just noted” [74]. It would take almost two
centuries until Gabriel Lamé gave the complete and precise geometrical interpre-
tation of these curves. The conjecture ﬁnally became a theorem when Andrew
Wiles gave the ﬁnal proof in the last decade of the 20th century. Lamé himself
noticed the correspondence with his curves and eventually succeeded in proving the
Last Theorem of Fermat for n = 7.
While Fermat focused on the arithmetic properties, Isaac Barrow studied these
curves from a geometrical perspective, one generation later. Barrow’s Geometrical
Lectures, Explaining the Generation, Nature and Properties of Curve Lines, were
originally published by the author in Latin, but translated (and revised, corrected
and amended) by Isaac Newton. In these lectures Isaac Barrow (1630–1676)
demonstrates his tangent method on quasicircular curves (Cycloformibus) in the
second example given in Lecture X [75].
Barrow gave a geometric interpretation of these curves, but these equations are
well known in mathematics, as a particular case of Diophantine equations, as can be
found in geometry textbooks of these periods. For example, in Traité élémentaire de
géometrie à deux et trois dimensions of August Comte in 1843 [76], various
examples are given of trinomic equations of the type ym þ axn ¼ b, with x3 þ y3 ¼ 1
(Fig. 4.2) and more generally x2m þ 1 þ y2m þ 1 ¼ 1. The development of analytic
geometry clariﬁed the relation between these equations and the curves they repre-
sent. For example, the equation for the Folium of Descartes is x3 þ y3 ¼ 3axy:
The Last Theorem of Fermat was eventually proven, but there are many prob-
lems in Diophantine equations that have similar expressions. In the opinion of Carl
Friedrich Gauss: “Fermat’s Theorem as an isolated proposition has very little
interest for me, because I could easily lay down a multitude of such propositions,
which one could neither prove nor dispose of” [77]. Indeed, Gauss had the good
foresight, since it has become known, in the 1970s that most Diophantine problems
are unsolvable. What is interesting here is that Lamé focused on a subset, with the
integer exponents and without geometric means. He emphasized the geometrical
meaning and use of such curves in the natural sciences. In the future such geometric
approach, more restricted than the general case, will help in solving problems and
challenges in other ﬁelds as well.

Lamé Curves and Surfaces

The Immortal Works of Gabriel Lamé
Isaac Barrow and Gabriel Lamé are separated by one and a half century. Progress
takes time. Introducing shapes (or manifolds) with corners or discontinuities, in a
ﬁeld where deviation from straightness is measured by comparison with circles, has
a long history (and the current book has the same goal). Gabriel Lamé was very
proud to be able to trace out the path of integrating crystallography, one of the most
beautiful applications of mathematics, into analytic geometry. He thus closed the
circle for considering two variables raised to arbitrary power, that can either be
multiplied (power laws, superparabola and superhyperbola, related to geometric
means) or added/subtracted (supercircles, related to arithmetic means).
Gabriel Lamé undoubtedly was one of the leading mathematicians in the ﬁrst
half of the 19th century. For Carl-Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) Gabriel Lamé was
the best French mathematician of this time [78] (and there was quite some com-
petition indeed). When Lamé died in 1860 Joseph Bertrand, secretary of the
Académie Française with illustrious members like Christiaan Huyghens, Laplace,
Lagrange, Monge, Poisson, and Fourier (and many famous mathematicians ever
since) wrote: “Lamé was a great geometer and he has created methods that are
classic today. Above all he was a great mind, a thinker on the most difﬁcult
subjects, a dedicated researcher in search of nature’s most hidden secrets. No role
is greater in the history of science than that of geometrical physicists. This great
school has known many illustrious examples within our own Academy, ever since
Huyghens. The one we loose today was, in the opinion of all, their most eminent
successor” [79].
Lamé’s interests were very broad, and he was both mathematician and engineer
(so, difﬁcult to classify) [80]. He was the ﬁrst to introduce the equation of a plane in
the form x
a þ y
b þ z
c ¼ 1: As Coolidge remarks: “The marriage of algebra and
geometry was not without problems in the ﬁrst centuries after Fermat and
Descartes and in the 19th century several geometers proposed different solutions,
with Lamé as one of the ﬁrst” [81]. For our study of natural shapes it is noteworthy
that Fibonacci series were also known as Lamé-series in the 19th and early 20th
century [82]. Lamé used this series in relation to the efﬁcient algorithm he devel-
oped for computing the greatest communal divisor. In Mathematics of the 19th
century, edited by A.N. Kolmogorov and A.P. Yushkevic, Gabriel Lamé’s work in
various ﬁelds of mathematics is discussed, and his picture is shown in two of the
three volumes [83].
Especially Lamé’s work on curvilinear coordinates [84] became very inﬂuential
[85], and some historians of mathematics even consider this as the real start of
differential geometry of surfaces. Lamé’s mathematical discoveries are closely
linked to his research in the theory of elasticity and mathematical physics. He was

the ﬁrst to apply curvilinear coordinates in space using an orthogonal system,
giving the length of an element as:
ds2 ¼ H2dq2 þ H2
1dq2
1 þ H2
2dq2
2
ð4:4Þ
Another great geometer Gaston Darboux (1842–1917) spoke of the immortal
works on curvilinear coordinates, “les immortels travaux de Lamé sur les
coordonnées curvilignes” [86]. Lamé is considered as a father of mathematical
physics [87] with the introduction of the differential parameters (invariants) of a
scalar ﬁeld, of ﬁrst and second kind.

These are the Laplacian, expressed in Cartesian and polar coordinates. The
curvilinear coordinates and the differential parameters introduced by Lamé inspired
the Italian school of differential geometry with Ricci, Levi-Civita and Beltrami.
Vincensini writes: “C’est à l’instar de G. Lamé, qui a fondé la théorie des
coordonnées curvilignes de l’espace euclidien à trois dimensions sur la
considérations de deux paramètres différentiels, l’un de 1er ordre et l’autre du 2ème,
ouvrant ainsi la voie au calcul différentiel absolu de Ricci et Levi-Civita, que
Beltrami a été amené à introduire de son côté, dans la géométrie différentielle des
surfaces, les paramètres différentiels qui portent son nom” [88].
Gabriel Lamé should not only be considered as one of the founders of differ-
ential geometry, but also of Riemannian geometry in the opinion of Elie Cartan
(1869–1951), the leading geometer of the 20th century. He wrote that the coordi-
nates introduced were not as general as those introduced by Riemann and
Helmholtz, but it was Riemannian geometry anyway: “D’autre part Lamé, quelques
années, il est vrai, après la Dissertation de Riemann, avait, pour la géométrie
euclidienne à trois dimensions, introduit des coordonnées n’ayant pas un aussi
grand degré de généralité que celles de Riemann, mais, dans ce cadre un peu plus
restreint, il faisait aussi en somme de la géométrie riemannienne” [89].
Roughly speaking, an n-dimensional manifold is anything in which points can
be deﬁned by an n-tuple of numbers. Curves are examples of which each point can
be described by two numbers, the coordinates, or three, for curves in space. If the
manifold admits a differentiable structure, it is called a differentiable manifold. In
such manifolds one can measure distances and angles and the notion of curvature
makes sense. Such measurements can be done on the manifold itself.

The generalized Pythagorean Theorem sensu Lamé uses pure numbers only,
while the one sensu Gauss in differential geometry uses geometric means as well.
From Lamé to Square Bamboos
Lamé curves can be used to measure distances in the real world. Cityblock L1, the
Euclidean metric L2, and the max norm L∞are well-known examples of p-th root
metric of Minkowski (Lp metrics). The taxicab metric is a good example, where
taxis need to drive in a system of parallel streets in a rectangular array. These
metrics deﬁne unit balls (or unit circles in the plane), different from our classic
Euclidean circle [28]. Obvious examples for unit balls are Lamé curves. It was one
of the main topics of the successors of Gauss and Riemann, namely David Hilbert
and Hermann Minkowski. Minkowski created the formal tools to study problems
about convex regions and bodies, also in relation to extremal problems and opened
the way for the study of norms other than the Euclidean norm on ﬁnite dimensional
spaces. This was generalized to functional spaces by the Hungarian mathematician
F. Riesz around 1913 [90]. Whereas Minkowski geometry is more general than
Lamé’s approach to describe crystals, it would be logical to call this geometry
Lamé-Minkowski geometry.
Due to the work of the Danish mathematician and inventor Piet Hein, Lamé
curves became very popular in the 1960s, amongst others with articles of Martin
Gardner in his series in the Scientiﬁc American, later published in the book
Mathematical Carnival [65] and a great article in Life Magazine (1966) “Piet Hein
bestrides arts and science” [91]. In The Mathematical Gazette, N.T. Gridgeman
wrote: “Piet Hein, the contemporary Danish poet-designer-scientist (and inventor
of mathematical games) rediscovered the curves and has been using “superellipses”
(Lamé curves with n > 2, and therefore oval) in objets d’art, furniture, pottery,
fabric patterns, and so on. But his major achievement to date is a sunken oval
shopping plaza, promenade, and pool in the center of Stockholm…” [92].
For Piet Hein the superellipse was an iconic solution between a round and a
square worldview: “Man is the animal that draws lines, which he himself then
stumbles over. In the whole pattern of civilization there have been two tendencies,
one toward straight lines and rectangular patterns and one toward circular lines.
There are reasons, mechanical and psychological, for both tendencies. Things
made with straight lines ﬁt well together and save space. And we can move easily –
physically or mentally – around things made with round lines. But we are in a
straitjacket, having to accept one or the other, when often some intermediate form
would be better. To draw something freehand – such as the patchwork trafﬁc circle

they tried in Stockholm – will not do. It isn’t ﬁxed, it isn’t deﬁnite like a circle or
square. You don’t know what it is. It is not esthetically satisfying. The superellipse
solved the problem. It is neither round nor rectangular, but in between. Yet it is
ﬁxed, it is deﬁnite – it has a unity. The superellipse has the same beautiful unity as
circle and ellipse but is less obvious and less plain. The superellipse frees us from
the straightjacket of simple curves such as lines and planes” [91].
Piet Hein was also famous for his Grooks, small, illustrated poems. One of my
favorite ones is the grook that warns against megalomania: “The Universe may be
as big as they say, but it would not be missed, if it didn’t exist”.
The superelliptic shape of Sergel’s Torg combines the power of the rectangle to
optimize the area of the shopping center and the power of the ellipse to optimize the
trafﬁc ﬂow (Fig. 4.4). The same principles were observed in many plants, starting
with
square
bamboos
[93].
Certain
species
of
bamboos
of
the
genus
Chimonobambusa, have square-like stems along the whole length of the culms, or
only in the lower part. They grow in temperate zones, at heights between 500 and
1800 m of altitude, with annual mean temperatures of 8–20 °C, with minimum
temperatures up to −15 °C. One species, Chimonobambusa quadrangularis has
particularly superelliptical stems. The name Chimonobambusa refers to the fact that
the culms develop late in the season (Chimono is autumn) (Fig. 4.5).
The representation which led to Gielis curves originates in the study of ﬂowers,
where the shape of petals or sepals can be, like in the leaﬂets of Marsilea (Fig. 2.2)
arranged in a “square”, rather than a circle. This fact, unnoticed by botanists, was
originally found in Hydrangea (Fig. 4.6).
Many plants have square stems, most notably Lamiaceae and Melastomataceae
[94]. This is related to decussate phyllotaxy, but also to optimization principles,
related to space use or resistance against bending or torsion. One notable example is
teak (Tectona grandis) in which all young stems and branches are square, supporting
large leaves. Square stems are also found in various succulent Euphorbias and
Asclepiads. Lamé ovoids are found in stem succulents and pachycaul trees, like
Jatropha berlandieri, Calibanus hookeri, Pachypodium brevicaule and Nolina. One
ﬁnds many examples in nature with fourfold symmetry, in bacteria, diatoms, plant
anatomy, the shape of Bénard cells in hydrodynamics, up to the shape of galaxies.

In the late 20th century these surfaces were introduced in the ﬁeld of computer
graphics, as superquadrics [95, 96]. With slight variations, supertoroids and
superhyperboloids of one or two sheets could be deﬁned. The cross sections of
toroids or hyperboloids could be made in any shape deﬁned by Lamé curves.
Gabriel Lamé himself went from squares to hexagons and into 3D by combining
shapes to describe crystal shapes. One example of combinations of 3D-superspheres

Lamé Curves and Surfaces

The choice of parameters a and b provides a weight factor for adding the
octahedron and dodecahedron to the cube. In Fig. 4.7 the inﬂuence of a and b is
visualized. The shapes are given for p ! 1. It is noted that in general algebraic
expressions for 2D or 3D shapes are not simple. Simple sums however, are not
entirely satisfactory since in combining shapes, the zones where the original shapes
meet (two or more) may be transition zones with sharp edges and cusps. By
moderating the exponent p the edges can be rounded and this example in nano-
materials is only one of many applications of Lamé’s ideas of superellipses and
superquadrics. Lamé’s ﬁngerprints are everywhere in nature [99].

Gielis Curves, Surfaces
and Transformations
Describing form is one of the more intractable problems in
biology. Researchers have come up with many ways to describe
leaves and shells, for example, but there is little unity: Things
have become cumbersome and idiosyncratic. The Superformula
might provide a single, simple framework for analysing and
comparing the shapes of life. This is an exciting development.
Karl J. Niklas
Lamé Curves in Polar Coordinates
In Lamé Ovals, Gridgeman writes: “The set of Lamé curves for A = B and n > 1
ﬁlls the area between a square and its inscribed circle. A further generalization that
immediately suggests itself is the coverage of the analogous curves that lie between
other regular polygons and their inscribed circles. This is merely a remark” [92].
Indeed, one major drawback of Lamé curves, supercircles and superquadrics is their
limitation to squares and fourfold symmetry, describing circles, squares and rect-
angles, cubes and spheres, but not triangles, pentagon or octahedrons. This chal-
lenge can be addressed when rewriting Lamé curves in transcendental functions, via
polar coordinates. The step to the Superformula or Gielis curves and transforma-
tions is a logical extension of Lamé curves, in which the concept of supercircles is
generalized to include symmetries for any real number, integer or non-integer.

The circle is a special case for n ¼ 2, with equation q #

have the same “structure” as the Pythagorean Theorem. Actually q #

Generalized Pythagorean Theorems
In the same way as cosines and sines are deﬁned on the circle, Lamé sines and
cosines (nsin and ncos) are deﬁned on supercircles. This leads in a natural way to a
generalization of the Theorem of Pythagoras for Lamé curves [101, 102], with the
classical Theorem for n = 2

The stretched radii and the coordinate functions are very shape speciﬁc. One
invariant is the halﬂength of the curve, a speciﬁc number we call pn in case of Lamé
curves [102]. For n ¼ 2, the Lamé curve is the circle and pn¼2 ¼ p. An inﬁnity of
beautiful equations, relations, and geometries can be derived from this simple
principle, but they are all interconnected.
The Folium of Descartes can be considered as an historically early version of
5.1, as a transformation acting on a function f #
ð Þ, rather than on a constant function
R. In this case the function is f #
ð Þ ¼ 3a sin # cos #, for n2,3 = 3 and n1 = 1.

In Cartesian coordinates the Folium is deﬁned as x3 þ y3 ¼ 3axy; from which
x3 þ y3
3axy ¼ 1. If we convert to polar coordinates by directly substituting x ¼ cos # and
y ¼ sin # we obtain the equation of the Folium in polar coordinates [72].
Equation 5.5 can also be read as the product of two coordinate functions of a
Lamé curve as follows:

Here we have the same idea: what is 1 in Cartesian coordinates can be con-
sidered as a “stretchable” unit element q #
ð Þ, dependent on #. The Folium is one of
the rare instances where Cartesian and polar expressions are “one-on-one”. In
general this is not straightforward at all. We will develop a method later for a
one-on-one conversion for supershapes from polar to Cartesian and back.
From Lamé to Gielis Curves
The exponent n is applied to the trigonometric functions individually, and to the
root over the sum of both. It is easy to envisage, like Euzet did, that these can have
different values, increasing the degrees of freedom. We denote the exponents over
the cosine and sine term by n2 and n3 respectively, and n1 over the sum of both as
1
n1. For n2 = n3 and n2;3\1, the shape is inscribed in the base circle n2;3 ¼ 2: For
n2;3 [ 2 the shape will circumscribe the circle. The parameter 1
n1 then acts as a pull
or push force on the sides of the shape, while the anchor points of the shape to the
circle (at 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) will remain ﬁxed.

Introducing a coefﬁcient m/4 that allows more particular symmetries of rotation
around O than those related to the four quadrants of the Cartesian co-ordinate
system, and increasing the degrees of freedom in the exponents occurring in the
three terms of Lamé curves in polar coordinates, we obtain [1, 2, 100]:

with A; B; n1 2 R0; m; n2;3 2 R. Examples are shown in Fig. 5.2.
The parameters can be real numbers, not necessarily integers as in Lamé curves.
The values of m can be different on both cosine (m1) and sine (m2) terms and the
two terms can be added or subtracted. Indeed, a minus sign allows for describing
curves with indeﬁnite metrics based on hyperbolas rather than on ellipses.
Interestingly, the base of the natural logarithms and the catenary, the illustrious
number e; is based on the hyperbola. A unit “invariant under change” is deﬁned as
the area under a hyperbola having value 1; running from +1 to the number corre-
sponding to e. If we start from x2  y2 ¼ 1; and follow the same route as (5.1) we
get a minus sign in (5.9). More generally for A; B; n1 2 R0; m1;2; n2;3 2 R, we have:

To describe points inside or outside the curves, Eqs. 5.8 and 5.9 can also be
written as inequalities, using . #

ð Þ  instead of the equality. In this case
each point inside and outside the shape is deﬁned, and consequently height, colors,
or density gradients can be described as well; a homogeneous blue color or a
gradient of different colors, both are possible (Fig. 5.3).
Those curves will further be referred to as supershapes, in analogy to superel-
lipses or supercircles. Equations 5.8 and 5.9 were originally called Superformula.

Fig. 5.3 Supershapes in continuous color gradients [104]

After the initial publication (in botany), in mathematics supershapes were renamed
as Gielis curves. In scientiﬁc literature one ﬁnds also names like Gielis Formula GF
or Gielis Superformula GSF.
Superpolygons and Regular Polygons
With the symmetry variable m in Eqs. 5.8 and 5.9, zerogons (m ¼ 0; no-angles),
monogons (m ¼ 1; one-angles), and digons (m ¼ 2; two-angles), as well as trian-
gles ðm ¼ 3Þ, squares ðm ¼ 4Þ and polygons with higher rotational symmetries can
be deﬁned. The parameter m allows the orthogonal axes used in superellipses, to
fold in or out like a fan and determines the number of points ﬁxed on the unit circle
(or ellipse for A 6¼ B) and their spacing. These points will always remain ﬁxed.
The values of n2 and n3 (for n2 = n3) determine whether the shape is inscribed in
or circumscribing the unit circle. For n2 = n3 < 2 the shape is inscribed (subpoly-
gons), while for n2 = n3 > 2 the shape will circumscribe the circle (superpolygons).
The value of n1 will further determine the shape and acts like a gravitational pull
force away from or towards to the unit circle. Corners can be sharpened or ﬂattened
and the sides can be straight, convex or concave (Table 5.1 [102]).
Subpolygons are inscribed in the circle and rotated by p/m relative to super-
polygons, circumscribing the circle. Interestingly, when subpolygons transform into
superpolygons (and vice versa), vertices transform into edges, and edges into
vertices, because of the ﬁxed points on the unit circle. Similar closed shapes are
generated which close after one rotation (0–2p) by selecting zero or a positive
integer for m. Exactly the same shape is generated for every subsequent rotation by
2p. When further changes of Eq. 5.8 are applied, such as when A and B are not
equal, shapes as in Table 5.1, column 8 result.
Lamé curves give a precise expression for squares (inscribed square for n = 1

Gielis Curves, Surfaces and Transformations

Polygrams and Generic Symmetries
Equations 5.8 and 5.9 also work for non-integer rational m. When m is not an
integer, the shape generated does not close after one rotation. If m ¼ p=q is a
rational number, the shape will close after a number of rotations equal to q and the
number of ‘angles’ is p. Such shapes may be called “superpolygrams”, in analogy
with “polygrams” or Rational Gielis curves RGC.
For m = 5/2 for example, the shape will close with ﬁve angles after only two
rotations and will then have 5/2 or 2.5 angles in one rotation, spaced 144° or 4p/5
apart (Fig. 5.5). For m = 8/3 the shape will close after three rotations and will be
repeated every 6p. The rational numbers 5/2 and 8/3 are ratios of Fibonacci
numbers F, more speciﬁcally the ratio of Fn þ 2 and Fn with n indicating the position
of the number Fn in the Fibonacci sequence. This is the inverse of the ratios used to
describe Fibonacci patterns in plant phyllotaxy Fn=Fn þ 2 (such as 2

repeating pattern using irrational numbers, but, for example, a p-gon will have on
the average p angles per rotation. We prefer m rather than 1=m since our super-
shapes generate the genetic spirals.
For a pentagon and superpentagons this is equal to k.72°. For a pentagram and
superpentagrams with generic symmetry 5/2, the angles are spaced 144° apart

(Figs. 5.5 and 5.6). In two rotations the shape closes and the number of angles for
pentagon and pentagram is equal. The axes of symmetry for regular polygons pass
through the origin and k.2p/m, and through the origin and k.p/m with k integer.
One example of “generic symmetry” concerns superpolygons with alternating
short and long sides. In this case the classical view would assign different sym-
metries, as in the case of a rectangle versus a square. In Lamé superellipses how-
ever, we have both squares (for R) and rectangles (for A 6¼ B), whereby the edges
can be equal or alternating long and short sides. This can be extended with Eq. 5.8.
Indeed, it is only in a superﬁcial way that these curves have a different symmetry. In
Fig. 2.2 the “hexagonal” molecular symmetry of ice is retained in seemingly “tri-
angular” snowﬂakes. If m = 6 for example, for A 6¼ B a hexagon with alternating
short and long side results starting from an ellipse, and the snowﬂake’s symmetry
remains six, corresponding to its molecular symmetry.

Gielis Transformations
Gielis curves can be interpreted starting from the unit circle centered at 0 (q = 1)
by the transformation for any choice of parameters A; B; m; n1; n2; n3. The
superformula transforms the unit circle into various sub- and supercircles. The
reverse is also true: all supercircles are (unit) circles in their own right. Instead of
transforming the unit circle, all planar curves determined by polar equation
q ¼ f ð#Þ, whereby f ð#Þ can be any positive real function, can be transformed into
planar curves with polar equations [100]:

Transforming a circle with radius R is obtained for f #
ð Þ ¼ R. Two logical
functions to transform are spirals and trigonometric functions. Trigonometric
functions are closely related to ﬂowers, since Guido Grandi (1671–1742), in a letter
to Leibniz in 1713, described rose curves or Rhodonea curves as q #
ð Þ ¼ cos m#.
These Rhodonea or rose curves actually were the inspiration to include the m/4
symmetry parameter.
When our transformation is applied to Rhodonea curves, superﬂowers or
superroses result. For the ﬂowers in Fig. 5.7, the petal number is determined by
cos m# and their size by n4: In a classic rose curve the number of petals is m for
m odd and m/2 for m even. By using absolute values on the numerator, the number
of petals is the value of m, for m odd or even.

We say that the original function
f ðhÞ is transformed, just like the circle with radius f h
ð Þ ¼ R is transformed into
starﬁsh or regular polygon. Hence we call Eq. 5.12 the Gielis Transformation.
Spirals are another logical choice of functions. There is a wide variety of spirals,
with the Archimedean spiral q #
ð Þ ¼ a : # and various conchoids. The logarithmic
spiral q #
ð Þ ¼ ea# is a most interesting one, because of its connection to the
exponential function and the catenary, its origin in the hyperbola, and its ubiquity in
natural shapes (Fig. 5.8). The famous Nautilus shell is one of the iconic and
quintessential examples of mathematics in nature but with our transformations most
of the shells of mollusks can be generated (Fig. 5.9).
There are a wide number of spirals in geometry. Particular examples are sine
spirals, Cornu-Euler spirals, Archimedean and logarithmic spirals. Interestingly,
Gino Loria wrote that a more general deﬁnition of spirals could encompass all
curves for which the easiest and most natural parametrization is via polar coordi-
nates: „Vorläuﬁg wollen wir als Spiralen alle Kurven bezeichnen, deren einfachste

Spirals may be interpreted very broadly, with a position vector ﬁxed at the pole
and turning around the axis perpendicular to this plane and through the pole, in
which the length of the vector can change, uniformly or with certain speed varia-
tions, allowing for a purely geometrical study.

Continuous Transformations
In 1917 D’Arcy Wenthworth Thompson published one of the ﬁnest books ever on
the relationship between mathematics and biology, On Growth and Form [26]. One
of the most important contributions in the book to biology was the transformation
theory, in which he shows with simple diagrams how certain species of ﬁsh, the
shape of leaves, or the skulls of mammals are connected geometrically. D’Arcy
Thompson unveiled how the connections could be deﬁned as continuous trans-
formations. Likewise, many shapes can transform into various other shapes in a
simple way in which the generic symmetry is deﬁned by the above equations.
A further interesting observation is in relation to symmetry and symmetry
breaking. The latter term has become very popular in science in the latter half of the
20th century and has become a fully accepted part of scientiﬁc terminology.
A (hypothetical) spherical egg cell is polarized after fertilization and all subsequent
cell divisions lead to a symmetrical/asymmetrical body, like the transformation of a
spherical egg into a pentagonal (non-biological) starﬁsh. There are however quite a

number of conceptual difﬁculties with such symmetry breaking concept: The
symmetry has to break “from inﬁnite” (based on the circle as a polygon with inﬁnite
symmetry), to ﬁve. In this respect, we can pose the following question:
When comparing the radial symmetry of a starﬁsh and a circle, which of the
following statements is true?
• The circle has a higher symmetry than a starﬁsh.
• The circle has a lower symmetry than a starﬁsh.
• The circle has the same symmetry than a starﬁsh.
• All of the above statements are correct.
All four statements are actually correct from our point of view. Using Eq. 5.8,
we have a starﬁsh for symmetry m = 5. The circle (our classical Euclidean circle) is
obtained either as a zerogon (for m = 0) or as a polygon with inﬁnitely many edges
in the Archimedian tradition of approximating a circle by polygons with increasing
number of sides. But in Eq. 5.9, for A ¼ B; n2 ¼ n3 ¼ 2 the denominator becomes
1 for ANY value of the symmetry parameter m. So it can also be 5, the same as the
symmetry of the starﬁsh.
Any supershape (e.g. Table 5.1) can be transformed into a circle, for A ¼
B; n2 ¼ n3 ¼ 2 and the circle can be morphed or transformed into any other
supershape, by changing the parameters. With Eq. 5.8, a circle can be of any
symmetry, including a pentagon, as long as n2,3 = 2. So moving from a circle to a
pentagon and a starﬁsh requires no change in symmetry at all—it is ﬁve in all cases
—and changing of the exponents sufﬁces (Fig. 5.10). Since the circle is one of the
pentagons (for n = 2) no symmetry breaking needs to be called upon to precisely
describe this transformation. Variations in starﬁsh (developmental, intraspeciﬁc…)
can be quantiﬁed precisely, in line with D’Arcy Thompson’s transformations.
Symmetry is not written in stone in mathematics. One way of deﬁning symmetry
is the preservation of some measure related to some characteristic of some objects
under the application of certain kinds of transformations to these objects [106, 107].
And, depending on which characteristics, objects or transformations, or even
measurements one decides to use to compare shapes before and after the trans-
formations has been applied, quite a number of different symmetries may be in
agreement with this deﬁnition. So, from a rigid Euclidean point of view, a starﬁsh
and a circle are not the same (they are not congruent ﬁgures), but from our point of
view, they are the same, just as circle and square became members of one family
through Lamé’s work. They become commensurable, and can be compared.
For the sake of the argument, the starﬁsh in Fig. 5.11 may be different species,
different individuals within a species or even may depict a sequence of development
of one individual starﬁsh, starting as a very small structure upper left, down to a fully
grown starﬁsh lower right. So we may compare individual starﬁsh among species,
within species or instances in time of the growth of one individual as continuous
transformations. The latter view is important since we can understand and study one
starﬁsh as an individual, changing shape and size during development, but remaining
the same individual in its travel through space-time. Likewise, in a broader view,

differences between species, may be the result of the branching of an evolutionary
tree, which becomes continuous, instead of discrete and contingent.
Invariance Properties of Supershapes
The equations also permit precise quantiﬁcations and then the description of a wide
variety of shapes into one single equation gives many opportunities in under-
standing certain aspects of optimization in plants and natural shapes. The equations
themselves permit direct calculation of associated characteristics such as area,
perimeter, polar moment of inertia, deﬁned by:

We have the following invariances (for a reasonable choice of the parameters):
The invariance of length qðhÞ at kp/m for all m, with k an integer. This follows
directly from the equations. While in this expression m = 0 is formally excluded,
the fact that distance is the same for any angle is the very characteristic of a circle,
or zerogon (m = 0). Again, the parameter m deﬁnes how the points are spaced. With
the introduction of m/4 the plane can be divided into any number of sectors, deﬁned
by m integer or rational. Equation 5.8 maps the values calculated for supercircles
with m = 4, onto different axis systems deﬁned by m.
For example, in a hexagon, the value at 60° (2p/6) is equal to the value of 90° in
a square (m = 4 in Eqs. 5.8 or 5.9). The value at 30° in a hexagon (p/6) is equal to
the value at 45° in a square. So distances at k.2p/m are always the same, for any
value of m and any real number k.
Second, conservation of area for given exponents n, for all values of m. Stated
otherwise, when the rotational symmetry parameter m is changed, the shapes
respond by making their sides more concave or convex, in order to preserve the area
(Fig. 5.12). Third, is conservation of polar moment of inertia Ip (Eq. 5.14) for given
exponents n, for all values of m.
Gielis Surfaces and Volumes
The curves in 2D-planes can readily be extended to surfaces. Instead of supercircles
and superellipses we have “supersurfaces, superspheres, superellipsoids and su-
perquadrics” [108]. The extension from polar to spherical coordinates is straight-
forward. Starting from

In a kinematic way the sphere is a surface of rotation obtained by turning a circle

Hence 3D-supershapes can be deﬁned on the basis of two perpendicular sections

understood as follows: the left 2D shape of the pair is deﬁned in the XY plane and is
turned around the Z-axis following the path deﬁned by the right 2D shape of the pair.
This makes 3D shapes conceptually simple: 3D supershapes based on two perpen-
dicular sections, in which one section is the object and the other section is the path.

When both path and objects are superellipses (Eq. 5.4 with m = 4; n1 = n2 = n3),
superellipsoids are obtained. When both .1 #

ð Þ are zerogons or circles
(.1 #
ð Þ ¼ .2 u
ð Þ ¼ 1), a sphere results. When both .1 #
ð Þ; .2 u
ð Þ are squares, the
resulting supersurface is a cube. Combining a circle and a square results in a
cylinder and so on. For .1 #
ð Þ\.2 u
ð Þ we get a torus. This torus can also be square
if both path and object are square. When a twist is made we get Möbius bands.
Inequalities deﬁne solids as well, the complete domain.
The possibilities are then inﬁnite (Figs. 5.13 and 5.14). Instead of morphing
spheres and turning square, we can also extrude a shape along a path perpendicular
to that shape. A cylinder can be considered as a circle extruded along the vertical
passing through its center; or as circles stacked onto each other; or as the spherical
product of circle and rectangle. In fact all comes down to the same parametrization.
In this case we have generalized cylinders, whereby the circles can morph into
different cross sections at different heights as in cacti (Fig. 5.15). Depending on the
content of water in the column, the cross section will change in cacti and this can be
quantiﬁed in a precise way, within one single framework.
The shapes generated are surfaces using equality only. If however, inequalities
are used, the inside of the shape is described as well. This allows for deﬁning a
certain width to the surface, or from a material point of view, to add speciﬁc
homogeneous or non-homogeneous materials. The possibilities are then, indeed,
without limits (Figs. 5.16 and 5.17).

Gielis Curves, Surfaces and Transformations

Generalized Möbius-Listing Surfaces and Bodies
The helices, tori and Möbius bands in space can have any number of twists, any
cross section or even any way of avoiding selﬁntersection. They are toroidal knots
with a twist. Such analytic representations or equations substitute for “recipes” or
“(computer) algorithms” to “generate” Möbius strips, tori, helices or more complex
shapes. They are no longer simple parametrizations of different shapes, but they
combine these shapes into one equation, allowing for continuous transformations
from circle or sphere into any other shape, including knots and certain polyhedrons,
irrespective of topological constraints (Fig. 5.17).
In this sense transformations from sphere to torus e.g. with intermediates as ring,
horn and spindle tori, become very natural. The reduction of “recipes” to equations,
with a concomitant reduction of shape complexity, has always led to progress in
science. This “old kind of science” has been true from Greek mathematics to the

present day. These analytic representations provide tractable formulations for
suitable studies in geometry (more particularly in low dimensional geometry and
topology), applied mathematics and mathematical physics. Moreover, such general
class of shapes is very natural indeed: It is kinematics and moving through space
rotation and twisting is described by the Frenet-Serret-Pagani equations (G.M.
Pagani was an Italian mathematician living in Belgium). One can generate an
inﬁnite number of shapes, based on kinematic or dynamic considerations.
Whereas our approach was one of discovery and understanding, the goal of any
geometrical strategy should always be that in the proposed analytical representa-
tion, each function and each parameter in the formula has a geometric meaning. It
turned out that in Tbilisi, 4000 km from my place Ilia Tavkelidze developed pre-
cisely this. Since the nineties he had been working on a concise and simple
description of complex shapes, as compositions of elementary movements in the

sense of Gaspar Monge. It was through our mutual friend P.E. Ricci, that a natural
contact developed.
A wide class of geometric ﬁgures called “Generalized Twisting and Rotated”
GTR bodies are described by his analytic representation with many classical objects
(torus, helicoid, helix, Möbius strips). A subset are Möbius-Listing surfaces and
bodies [115, 116]. The original motivation here was not natural shapes, but was
dedicated to topological properties of surfaces and bodies, in search for a uniform
description and based on elementary movements rotations and translations. The
original works of Gaspard Monge on elementary movements date back two cen-
turies, and 150 years separate the original description of Möbius-Listing ribbons
and the complete description of Generalized Möbius-Listing surfaces and bodies. In
science, good things need time.
These general developments were initiated independent from explorations of the
Gielis curves and surfaces in the study of natural shapes or from similar develop-
ments in computer graphics (Fig. 5.18). Combining both methods is most natural in
the same idea of object and path, using only elementary movements. Gielis curves
or surfaces as input for this general class expand this class of surfaces further to
bodies with interior structure [117, 118].

Þ is a given function which can deﬁne m-symmetric surfaces or bodies,
of which the ends can be connected with rotations or twists. Shorthand notation for
GMLn
m bodies has both upper and lower index. The lower index gives the symmetry
of the body or surface. So, a GML12
6 torus is a 6-symmetric cylinder with 12 twists
(obviously the twists are made relative to the symmetry of the ﬁgure).
The Möbius strip is an icon of mathematics. This “twisted cylinder” is obtained
by giving one end of a rectangular strip of paper a twist before joining both ends.
Simple as this may seem Möbius strips are one-sided, non-orientable surfaces with
some counterintuitive properties. Tracing out a path on a Möbius strip will show
that it has only one side and the whole strip can be painted in one color without

lifting the paint brush. If some form of identiﬁcation is done along the central line
before joining, one will ﬁnd that orientations are reversed after rejoining.
To cut a Möbius band either the cut is made along the basic line or along some
other line, called s-line and depending on the number of twists given (even or odd),
this gives different outcomes, either knots or links. On GMLn
m bodies or surfaces the
B-line and s-lines can be drawn and also B-zones (zones containing the B-line) or
s-zones (zones not containing the B-line) can be deﬁned. In this group of bodies the
restriction is given by the fact that the basic line is a circle. When GMLn
m bodies are
cut along well-speciﬁed lines, intricate patterns result, with close connections to
links and knots. In many cases the results of the cutting have been completely
classiﬁed, and also the general case of convex cross sections has been proven. There
is a direct connection to the shape and number of resulting bodies and zones deﬁned
by self-intersecting supershapes (Fig. 5.19).
One may be inclined to think that should be common knowledge, but in fact the
systematic study of GMLn
m and twisted and rotated bodies has only started in the last
two decades, also in differential geometry [119–121]. Applications are numerous, in
biology, physics and chemistry. The heart itself is a folded Möbius band or GMLn
m
and if one decreases the size (cone-like) one can study vortices (of water, light…)
with inner structure. The shapes in Fig. 5.19 could be very complex dynamical
systems, whereby the cutting or separation of zones is not a physical cutting with
scissors, but could be a separation due to vibration and nodes caused by this
vibration.
Many dynamical systems, which are considered chaotic today, may well have a
rich structure with discernible knots and links structure. The composite structure
may be traced back to the original GMLn
m with internal structure, and one could try
to ﬁnd the physical systems that led to the separation and the complex structure.

From a kinematic point of view, each of the components in Eqs. 5.21 and 5.22 has a
precise geometrical meaning. In this way complex movements can be decomposed
in simple movements [118].

Gielis Curves, Surfaces and Transformations

Analytic Representations or Transformations?
Various
names—supershapes,
superpolygons,
Gielis
Formula
GF,
Gielis
Superformula GS or Superformula SF—were used so far. The history of the name is
interesting in itself. I originally called Eq. 5.8 the Superformula, as a generalization
of superellipses and supercircles, names that are common names for Lamé curves.
I used this name in the book Inventing the Circle, published in 2001 (October) in
Dutch, in April 2003 in English. In April 2003 the ﬁrst scientiﬁc paper was pub-
lished as invited special paper in the American Journal of Botany. The names Gielis
curves, surfaces and transformations were launched by L. Verstraelen at a
Geometry meeting in Kragujevac (Serbia) in June 2004 [12]. Since then
Superformula, Gielis Formula and Gielis Superformula have been used in many
scientiﬁc articles referring to or using the Superformula.
To clarify the various names that are in use, we have to distinguish between
analytic representations or transformations. Are the equations used, analytic rep-
resentations, or do we consider them as transformations? In my opinion we can use
both. I use analytic representations only in a mathematical sense, but transfor-
mations in a much wider sense.
When the Superformula is turned into equality or an equation (GF = some
number or function) or inequality (GF smaller than or equal to some number or
function) it becomes an analytic representation of actual shapes (even if inﬁnitely
many) for speciﬁc parameter choices (or ranges). Another word is parametrization.
In the same way it represents surfaces (equality in 3D), volumes (inequality in 3D),
or n-dimensional manifolds or submanifolds. We can deﬁne annuli and shells with
different outer and inner boundary. Through the inequality, the domain is deﬁned or
parametrized as well.
So, in this sense analytic representation is the correct term, for describing super-
shapes or Gielis curves, -surfaces, -bodies, -lines, -manifolds and -submanifolds.
GMLn
m bodies and surfaces are also analytic representations. The parametrizations
can also contain functions, rather than parameters, whereby values of exponents
change over time, or along a shape (as in cacti).
Besides this synthesis step, in which the input are numbers (or functions) it is
also an analytic representation in (at least) two other meanings. First, when we do
the inverse with analysis of shapes or patterns. We scan a shape and try to estimate
the best parameter choice. It then provides the best Superformula analytic repre-
sentation for a set of measured points. The formula is very general, while for
modeling of natural shapes we often need less. For example, for the analytic rep-
resentation of bamboo leaves or tree rings we need only two parameters. Second,
when we try to ﬁnd an optimal shape determined by a speciﬁc parameter set
resulting from some optimization algorithm as for antennas, nanoshapes in chem-
istry, solar panels, wind turbines, gear etc. Hence it is an analytic representation or
parametrization of speciﬁc shapes in those three ways (synthesis, analysis and
optimization).
Analytic Representations or Transformations?
81

The original title of the paper in the American Journal of Botany is A generic
geometric transformation that uniﬁes a wide range of natural and abstract shapes.
While the uniﬁcation is the discovery of one generic, uniform analytic represen-
tation, it is also a transformation. Indeed, shapes can be easily transformed into one
another by changing numbers, either in discrete steps or in continuous ways. So,
while we understand that speciﬁc shapes can be described by their analytic repre-
sentation, in this sense it is a transformation and also, obviously, geometric. So
there is a historical reason to use “transformations”, and there are a number of other
ways and meanings in which we can use the word transformation.
Natural shapes can change shape and during growth, or evolution, the shapes
morph or transform into other shapes. Transformation has the same meaning here as
“changing shape” or morphogenesis. I also want to stress that it is geometric and
generic so that it can be used in any ﬁeld of science, avoiding the restriction of
botany or biology only. Morphing shapes is also the subject of topology. One way
of viewing history is that topology was born because the appropriate geometrical
formulae were lacking. We now have a transformation in a geometric-topological
sense. It may not be as general yet as topological transformations, but general
enough for most practical purposes. So, yes we can have square tori and we can
transform these into a cup, or a sphere, shapes with other values for topological
genus g.
The next step, by considering it as transformations in Euclidean space, adds to
the wealth of Euclidean geometry. Since we can now make a vector stretch and turn
along a square, we deﬁne a square rotation. It adds to Euclidean geometry (with
translations, rotation, reﬂection, glide reﬂections and scaling), the idea of turning
square. It extends Lamé’s idea of coordinate systems adapted to the shape, of ﬁtting
a most natural coordinate systems to natural organisms or phenomena, embedded in
Euclidean space. In the end, having geometries for natural shapes with our trans-
formations we can understand that these geometries are subsets of a larger one.
In botany the word transformation even has a very special meaning, since
Goethe wrote:
Es war mir nämlich aufgegangen, dass in demjenigen Organ der Pﬂanze, welches wir als
Blatt gewöhnlich anzusprechen pﬂegen, der wahre Proteus verborgen liege, der sich in allen
Gestaltungen verstecken und offenbaren könne. Vorwärts mal rückwärts ist die Pﬂanze
immer nur Blatt…. [122].
Everything is leaf and from this simple principle the greatest diversity or variety
(Mannigfaltigkeit) of shapes in leaves, ﬂowers and reproductive systems is possible.
He was inspired by the phenomenon of proliferations in rose, where new vegetative
shoots develop inside ﬂowers (Fig. 5.20). Goethe’s views Alles ist Blatt has been
corroborated by plant molecular biology [123], and only for this we should consider
Goethe as a great observer and a true scientist.
Goethe understands the Mannigfaltigkeit in nature as variations on a theme
almost seventy years before Riemann introduced manifolds into geometry as the
multi-dimensional generalization of surfaces and curves, and before Darwin’s “from
so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been,

and are being, evolved” [124]. Goethe provided new glasses to view nature as a
continuum and thus inspired many of the developments in science and more,
directly or indirectly. His views on colors, whereby he showed that there are many
other colors than the distinct spectral colors of Newton, have become an integral
part of the science of colors [125].
The word transformation is used in a very general way, both as concept and
technique, that can be applied in many ﬁelds. Once more, it is a matter of words:
stating that shapes and phenomena are uniﬁed by one transformation, is the same as
saying that they can be described by the same analytic representation, of which
parameters can change in time or space, or both. This distinction applies to all
mathematical modeling.
Let us remember in this sense the wise words of René Thom: “All models divide
naturally in this way into two a priori distinct parts: one kinematic, whose aim is to
parametrize the forms or the states of the process under consideration, and the
other dynamic, describing the evolution in time of these forms” [9]. There is a
continuous transformation from circle to square, to starﬁsh, eggs, supereggs, and
many more shapes [126]. It is geometric topology, in which a precise geometric
meaning can be assigned to any shape, the kinematic parametrization, and the way
from one shape to the other, the dynamic one, in which time can be a parameter.
Hence the names Gielis Formula, (Gielis) Superformula or Gielis Transformations
are used interchangeably.

What is essential for the topological complexity of an object is
not the degree of the equation, but rather the number of
monomials that appear in the polynomial with nonzero
coefﬁcients. Thus, we have the problem of “oligomials”, i.e. the
topology of objects speciﬁed by polynomials of arbitrarily large
degree but with a restricted number of monomials.
Arnold and Oleinik [127]

As generalization of Lamé curves, the Gielis formula is deeply rooted in a long
tradition in mathematics of developing compact methods for shape description,
striving for a uniform description. To each interesting development in science there
is also a foreground, a future. While it is a powerful formula, opening doors in
science and mathematics, we must not think of the Superformula or Gielis Formula
as something ultimate. It generalizes Pythagoras, the Pythagorean Theorem,
trigonometric functions, conic sections and more, but should be thought of as an
inspiration to ﬁnd and develop further generalizations.
It is a compact expression with circular trigonometric functions having angles as
arguments, but we can consider the arguments of cosine and sine to be functions.
Indeed, a generalization of the Superformula with elliptic functions has been pro-
posed [128]:

where UI;II; WI;II are suitable amplitudes of Jacobi elliptic functions. This yields for
example shapes of Vinca ﬂowers (Fig. 6.1), but these can also be obtained using the
superformula, by slightly shifting the angle in the denominator by a factor e
(Fig. 6.1).

This generalization was introduced by R. Chacon: “Since the price of the
strikingly broad and complex diversity of natural shapes is the inherent nonlinear
character of the processes giving rise to them, one should expect that even the most
elemental formulas aimed at describing them should be expressed in terms of
nonlinear mathematical functions closely related to general (i.e. nonlinear) natural
processes” [128]. The proposed Jacobian elliptic functions were solely intended as
examples of this line of thinking.
Dealing with modeling geometrical shapes, however, this selection appears quite
restrictive, since the non-linearity is restricted by the use of these particular func-
tions. In order to generalize the Gielis formula, it is simpler to introduce the fol-
lowing more general equation [129]:

In the original formula 5.8, we stretched (or shrunk) the radius for constant
spacing of angle #. The next step is to stretch or modify these angles and their
spacing. The genius of Pythagoras was to separate variables avoiding geometric
means between variables. In Eqs. 5.8 and 5.9, this idea is preserved and so is the
structure of the formula. Generalized forms of the Gielis formula (Eq. 6.3) retain
this very compact representation and structure (Figs. 6.2 and 6.3).

Thus far we have assumed that the functions are 2kp periodic, deﬁned by one
single set of parameters. Of course, we can deﬁne curves in segments as well, with
transitions between segments in any way we want. We may deﬁne a ﬁrst supershape
between 0º and 34º, a second one between 34º and 278º etc. It is furthermore easy to
imagine that in these transitions, or along the complete shape, the exponents change
as some functions of the angle. Another option is to replace the exponents by
functions, deﬁning change of time or space. Any of the parameters could be sub-
stituted by a particular function, so that the value of the parameters can change or
morph along the shape itself. Between two different points on a shape other
interpolation functions can be deﬁned changing one particular distance in a different
one. The possibilities are really inﬁnite, while the basic structure of the formula
remains compact and the same (Fig. 6.4).

k-Type Curves and a Generalization of Fourier Series
The shapes deﬁned thus far are single shapes. There are several ways to make
combinations and the simplest one is to simply sum shapes. Many well-known 2D
curves are a sum of two shapes, e.g. the cardioid, deﬁned in polar coordinates by
qð#Þ ¼ 1 þ sin # or q #
ð Þ ¼ 1 þ cos #: It has two parts, a base (unit) circle of
radius 1 and the sine or cosine (the coordinate functions of this same unit circle).
Modiﬁcations of the cardioid by our transformations describe leaves of various
plants (Fig. 6.5) and basic leaf types (Fig. 6.6).
This can further be used as a starting point for building curves and surfaces as
sums having the same center or origin. These sums are either of inﬁnite k-type, for
an inﬁnite sum of shapes, or of ﬁnite k-type with k integer for partial sums. We refer
to k-type Lamé-Gielis curves for a partial sum with k terms, with k a natural
number. They are deﬁned as the sum of k parts:

k-Type Curves and a Generalization of Fourier Series
91

All two-dimensional normal-polar domains can be described or approximated
accurately by selecting suitable modulator functions and parameters. Summation
can be continued for any k. Adding three ﬂower curves (or three modiﬁed Grandi
curves) result in the outline of a ﬂying bird, a 3-type curve. In this particular case
the functions are cosine functions with arguments 3, 4 and 5 inscribed in a circle, a
square and a pentagon, respectively. We can then construct sums of the shapes and
their coordinate functions, whereby these coordinate functions can be inscribed in
anisotropic spaces.
As a consequence all the 2D shapes discussed before (except the cardioid) are of
1-type. Rhodonea curves, also known as ﬂower curves or Grandi curves, are also
curves of 1-type, deﬁned by q #

arrive at m petals in ﬂowers. Applying our transformations to the Grandi curves led
to the ﬂowers deﬁned in Fig. 5.7. Another well known curve of 1-type is the

There is a natural alliance with trigonometric or Fourier series, which are deﬁned
in isotropic spaces. Now, each individual term of a Fourier series can be inscribed
within supershapes, e.g. the ﬂowers in Fig. 5.7. Each term of such series can be
associated with different points of the shape space deﬁned by Eq. 5.8 in which each
point denotes one particular shape. One can thus deﬁne a Super-trigonometric or
super-Fourier series (Eq. 6.5), or even a series of a more general type [134].

Since the ﬁrst constant term of the series a0 can be associated with a particular
transformation q0 then any shape described by Eq. 5.8 or Eq. 5.9 is described
precisely in only one term of this generalized series q0a0.
Certainly, any of the above shapes could be described by for example Fourier
series, but these are inﬁnite by deﬁnition, and even shorter expansions are of
considerable length. To quantify shape diversity (as in Begonia or maples) or even
more complex shapes, elliptic Fourier methods are well suited and widely used. If,
however, we need 200 harmonics to describe the outline of a leaf shape, the
compact representation of cardioid leaves or petals of ﬂowers as 1-type curves,
seems attractive. Especially if you know that the speciﬁc harmonics can differ
widely among different leaves. In addition, we not only describe boundaries, but
also the inside (disks or regions for self-intersecting polygrams).
In 3D, summing shapes can be performed comparable to Onaka’s superquadrics,
but with different position of the center. Shapes can then be combined via Boolean
operations, introduced in computer graphics by Ricci in the 1970s [135]. We used
those to develop a CAD modeler, to build individual shapes and combinations, like

sizes, since only numbers need to be stored. Every point is deﬁned uniquely (Fig. 6.7).
Pythagorean Trees, L-Systems and Fractals
A very interesting way to combine shapes with Boolean operations, while ensuring
differentiability throughout the domain, is via R-functions, named after V.L.
Rvachev (1924–2005). He showed that it is possible to translate Boolean operations
into equations. In this way he could build complex structures or domains, to solve
boundary value problems on these domains [136–138]. This gives clear advantages
over a pure combination of shapes, for example over L-systems and fractals, two
very powerful and popular systems for modeling of natural shapes.
L-systems are an algebraic way of modeling branching structures, named after
Aristid Lindenmayer (1925–1989). In his landmark paper Mathematical models for
cellular interactions in development [139], he introduced ﬁnite automata with
possibility of multiplication. Finite automata had been introduced earlier by the
mathematician
John
von
Neumann
(1903–1957),
like
Lindenmayer
born
Hungarian, but the extension with multiplication made it possible to model dividing
cells. The system was later extended to model complete plants in The Algorithmic
Beauty of Plants [140], and seashells in The Algorithmic Beauty of Seashells [141].
L-systems give only the skeleton of plants, but to this skeleton, tissues, leaves,
ﬂowers etc. can be added, to construct a complete plant (Fig. 6.8).
Fractals became a popular name through the work of Benoit Mandelbrot (1924–
2010), who generalized earlier work of the French mathematicians Julia and Fatou.
Fractals stressed scale-independence in nature, i.e. similar structures appear similar,
irrespective of scale; zooming in or out does not fundamentally change the shapes
[142]. Self-similarity is found throughout nature. The notion of non-integer or
fractal dimension has a close connection to power laws; they are superparabolas.
The notion of fractals combined many ideas that had been around for many years or
even millennia. Scale-independence was well known earlier, with Pythagorean trees

and spirals. The spiral of Theodorus of Cyrene shows the irrationality of roots of
integers 3 up to 17 (except those that are squares themselves, namely 4, 9 and 16).
In the Spiral of Theodorus of Cyrene, from vertex to vertex, the distance is always
equal to 1, and the hypothenuses then form the series

Another visualization of the spiral is the Pythagorean Tree, a drawing made by
J. Bosman in his book The Wondrous World of Plane Geometry [143] a decade
before Mandelbrot. In this wonderful book, he builds upon the Pythagorean
Theorem to draw the Pythagorean Tree as an example of scaling, self-similarity and
series expansion. One could start from a isosceles triangle, or any triangle, and
continue in any direction (Fig. 6.10). “The area of the larger square equals the sum

of the two next ones, and is equal to the sum of the four further ones, etc. The
number of squares with common equal areas grows: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256,
528, 512, 1024, 2048…. into a wondrous construction of the Pythagorean tree
made of sharp limit lines and the ﬁnest lace. Each square can be considered as the
original square from which the tree developed, so that this tree consists of joining
self-similar, ever smaller trees” [143].
Fractals provided a new, powerful way of looking at shapes and phenomena and
Benoit Mandelbrot’s The Fractal Geometry of Nature [142] is simply a magniﬁcent
book. The system of arteries and lungs, or plant phyllotaxy in plants can be viewed as
having fractal structure up to some degree (in nature that degree is not inﬁnite as in
mathematics). Fractals even inspired plant breeders and the Romanesco broccoli is a
nice example of this. Cauliﬂowers resemble the Pythagorean tree in Fig. 6.10 left,
while cutting Romanesco would give Fig. 6.10 right.

Pythagorean Trees, L-Systems and Fractals

Fractals may be considered as iterative systems, in which parts are added to a
shape, or removed from a shape. Examples are the Koch snowﬂake, the Sierpinski
Triangle and Cantor dust. In the case of the Koch snowﬂake on each side of a
hexagon, even smaller hexagons are placed. On each side of these smaller hexa-
gons, even smaller hexagons are placed. In Sierpinksi’s Triangle one starts by
deleting a smaller triangle can be deleted from the original one. These operations
can be repeated ad inﬁnitum. Starting from a line, one third can be removed, and
from the two remaining one-thirds again the middle third part can be removed.
After an inﬁnite number of steps a fractal dust, Cantor’s dust, results. L-systems can
also be used to generate these fractals, as they operate on a string of letters, and
string rewriting leads to rewriting systems. In this way many fractals can be gen-
erated, including Cantor dust, Sierpinski triangles and Koch snowﬂakes (Fig. 6.11).
Since fractals are often about applying a shape on the side of a basic shape, I
cannot resist pointing out one of the most beautiful (but lesser known) theorems of
Euclidean geometry. The Pythagorean Theorem (Euclid Book I, Theorem 47) is one
of the highlights of Euclid’s Books of Elements, and the application of squares to
the sides of a rectangular triangle is used to prove it (used in Pythagorean trees or
Theodorus’s spiral). In Proposition 31 in Book V, Euclid shows that the shape we
apply to the sides can be any shape. We can apply to each side of a rectangular
triangle some regular or irregular shape (or supershape). As long as they have the
same shape, the invariance property of the areas holds through the Pythagorean
Theorem. Isaac Barrow: “From this proposition you may learn to add or subtract
any like ﬁgures, by the same method that is used in adding or subtracting of
squares, in Scholium 47 in Book I” [75].
R-Functions and Supershapes
For the composition of shapes we need a geometric language with an algebraic
component. Whereas L-systems and fractals have as result a geometric shape, the
road to get to this shape is algebraic and algorithmic. Indeed, in L-systems the

algebra traces out only a skeleton to which ﬂesh needs to be added. In fractals such
as the Koch snowﬂake we are facing problems with differentiability. On the con-
trary, a geometric structure should immediately allow for applications of analysis
and calculus. ‘Geometric’ means that from the outset the solution we are seeking
allows to search for optimal solutions, in a purely geometric way. The development
of natural objects can then be studied with natural curvature conditions deﬁned
from within geometry.
We can integrate both L-system-like structures and fractals into one coherent
geometrical framework, using supershapes and R-functions. The language of
L-systems and fractals is then enriched by providing an overall geometric structure,
starting from geometry and ensuring differentiability at any level. Rvachev deﬁned
R-functions as geometrical translation of Boolean operations [138]. If we have two
geometric domains we deﬁne the function as positive everywhere inside the
domain, zero on its boundary and negative outside the domain. A union of these
two domains then takes all positive values inside and the boundary of the composite
shape has value zero everywhere. Rvachev succeeded in writing any Boolean
function in a geometrical way (Fig. 6.12).
Consider a space of shapes in which individual shapes are represented by points
in that space, the points are denoted by s1, s2, …. One point may represent a square
of certain size, another point a triangle or a circle. He found that looking at such
spaces in a geometrical way, he could transform logical Boolean operations
between shapes into equations. At the same time various of the R-functions he
deﬁned (Boolean operations are a subset only), could guarantee differentiability up
to any desired order. If two squares are combined, the transition between two
shapes could be blended or smoothed.
The logical “conjunction” A \ B (or s1 \ s2) denotes that a point has to belong to
A and B at the same time. It is the intersection between two sets A and B. In the
language of shapes: the point has to belong to both shapes. The logical “disjunction”
A [ B (s1 [ s2) denotes that a point has to belong to (at least) one of the sets. In the
language of shapes: the point has to belong to either s1or s2. We can use the triangle
inequality and the law of cosines to derive R-functions (Eq. 6.6).
Both disjunction and conjunction can be represented by the R-function

This can be extended to three dimensions, with conjunction, disjunction or
subtractions for ellipsoids and cubes, for spheres and cylinders. The Fichera
domain, named after the mathematician Gaetano Fichera (1922–1996), consists of a
cube from which a cube (1/8 of the original) is removed (Fig. 6.13). This also can
be extended to more than two shapes, of course. In this way composite domains can
be modeled efﬁciently, also fractals. In each step the shapes may remain the same or
differ. The combination of course depends on the proximity of shapes. They can
overlap or remain separate domains. In the latter case they are called disjoint.
Combining domains is only the beginning. The rationale for R-functions is to
solve differential equations on domains where problems with differentiability arise,
such as in corners of squares and polygons, or at cusps. This is the geometric

correspondence between R-functions with Lamé and Gielis curves has been for-

any positive value >1 [144].
In this way, differentiability is ensured up to order p or m, also non-integer
values. Directly differentiating R-functions in the Rp system gives for the ﬁrst

deﬁned whereby the function is positive inside the shape and negative outside, with
the original shape for f = 0. Such ﬁelds can be colors, heat maps, or anything, just
depending on how you deﬁne a ﬁeld.

One of the major advantages of R-functions is that we have a uniﬁed description for
shapes with our transformation. Any point in the space of supershapes has one
particular set of values namely s1 #; f #
ð Þ; m; A; B; n1; n2; n3
ð
Þ: The inequalities that
describe the supershape and its interior can be used directly in R-functions for
combinations. Yohan Fougerolle was the ﬁrst to make this fruitful combination [145,
146]. The rear axis of a truck in Fig. 6.15 is constructed out of 256 different
supershapes, and the turbine out of 5 supershapes. Notwithstanding the complexity it
is one single equation. Moreover, not only the points on the surface, but any point
inside the shapes is deﬁned as well using the R-functions. One can see immediately
how this can be applied to plants and their modular structure. Phytomers, the basic
modules consisting of a stem, bud and leaf structure can be combined in a modular
way.
What about our self-intersecting polygrams? The power of R-functions becomes
fully apparent when we consider self-intersecting supershapes for rational Gielis
curves m ¼ p
q ; with p and q positive integers [147]. A ray drawn from the center will
cross the self-intersecting shape in more than one point. It is a multivalued function.
In Fig. 6.16 below an RGC curve with m = 7/5 has at most 5 intersections between
the curve and a ray originating from the centre, resulting in ﬁve identiﬁable layers.
In Fig. 6.16 the potential ﬁelds are shown for the conjunction between the outer
envelope and the complement of its inner envelope for RGC with m = 5/2; m = 5/3;
m = 5/4 based on a distance deﬁned by the R-function used. Our original distance
functions are converted into ﬁelds and such ﬁelds could also be thought of as heat
maps, whereby more or less activity occurs in well-deﬁned sectors. As a matter of

fact, using the appropriate combinations and R-functions, each of the sectors can be
studied independently from every other sector with some examples shown in
Fig. 6.17. This strategy can be very useful. We can relate the sectors in Fig. 6.17
one-to-one on sectors and shapes resulting from a cutting process in Generalized
Möbius-Listing bodies. The heat maps of Fig. 6.16 might relate to increased

activity of genes, and the development of ﬂoral organs inside whorls with spiral
origin [147].
In the same way we can deﬁne fractals (which we limit here to polygon-like
structures). A snowﬂake of Koch in three and six steps and a Sierpinski triangle can
be constructed using supershapes combined via R-functions (Fig. 6.11) [148]. Not
only are these shapes captured in a single equation, but also here potential ﬁelds can
be deﬁned. A main difference with fractals or L-systems is that these are not
rewriting rules, replacements or substitutions. This allows for deﬁning ﬁelds in the
same way as above. The blue plane cuts (Fig. 6.11) through the whole structure
exactly for f = 0. Gielis transformations and Rvachev functions form a very natural
alliance [144], for regular and irregular curves, in the sense of [149].
R-Functions and Co-bordism
It was noted that a union between disjoint sets is possible as well, and in a certain
sense any smaller or larger triangle in the Sierpinski gasket is disjoint from any
other triangle in the zero level set. We can do the same for trees. If we start from
two overlapping circles (or supershapes), and move them gradually apart, at a
certain point they will separate. The circles become disjoint. However, they are still
connected through their “history”. This history can be visualized as a tree, which
branches at a certain point. In biology we know many trees: as plant models, as
evolutionary trees, as developmental steps…
We can develop plant models in this way. Starting from a central column, the
stem, branches will occur at well-deﬁned points, depending on the species and

growth habit of plants, which can be tree-, shrub- or cactus like. And those three
models are only three among many. Branching structures can include fasciated
stems or other plant parts, abnormally grown together. Also here we have a
beautiful connection to geometry and algebra. In the notion of cobordism [150],
two disjoint sets make up the boundary of a manifold of one dimension higher.
Two manifolds of dimension n are called cobordant if their disjoint union is the
boundary of a manifold of one dimension higher (For manifolds compactness etc. is
guaranteed). We can continue such process further. If we make a horizontal cut
through a tree, at the base we have one circle, while higher up we can have two or
more circles in the same plane (note that the circles may actually be more elliptical,
since the orientation of the branches is generally not vertical but oblique). These
connections and cobordisms are also crucial in certain theories in elementary par-
ticles [151] (Fig. 6.18).
These manifolds lack inner structure and may be considered as simpliﬁed ver-
sions of biological structures like trees, in which the history is engrained in the
wood and the speciﬁc shape of trees and branches. We can consider the tree and all
of its sections as a manifold of which all the sections belong to the tree, obvious for
any biologist. One can also consider the rhytidome (the bark) as a manifold (ob-
viously of a less continuous nature), and boundary to the “tree-manifold”. In nature,
trees grow and add tree rings with every year of growth and a cross section will give
lots of information about the tree. These can of course be considered as a distance
function, and the tree rings as a “heat map” in the sense of R-functions. Each ring
can be singled out as a zone (Fig. 6.19).
This history is very important in biology. We can represent a branching tree or
root system, a rhizomatic growth form like bamboo or grasses, and evolutionary
trees in this same way. Even more, since plants are clonal organisms, all clones that
are generated from one single or a few phytomers, share a common descent and
history. It is this history that connects millions of bamboos propagated via plant
tissue culture and distributed all over the world, in gardens and plantations. The
shapes resulting from cutting Generalized Möbius-Listing bodies with interior
geometry also share this common history, and remain connected as disjoint sets
through their history.

Shape Complexity and Oligomials
With our continuous transformations, we can morph any shape into many other
shapes, even into combinations of shapes. This is not the classical way of thinking,
where shapes are compared by their differences (shape, measure or topology).
Moreover, we can morph simple shapes into extremely complex ones, but the
compact representation remains the same. The shapes in Fig. 6.20 are not more
complex than the simple shapes, just a different set of numbers. How then to deﬁne
complexity?
If we want to determine the complexity of surfaces and curves, one idea is the
degree of the polynomial describing the curve. Traditionally this led to linear,
quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic etc. curves. 6x5 þ 678x4 ¼ 0 is a quintic curve of
degree 5 in one variable. The degree is higher than that of conic sections, with
degree 2, and more complex than quadratic ones. These can be solved in radicals,
whereas not all quintics are solvable.
On the other hand, a superparabola of degree 678 ðy ¼ x678Þ is of the same
complexity as the classical parabola, just one number difference, and another graph.
One can morph one into the other by changing the exponent from 678 to 2, con-
tinuous or discontinuous. Likewise, a Lamé curve with exponent n = 567 is not
more complex than a circle with n = 2, from a “deﬁning” point of view, nor is any of
the shapes in (Fig. 6.20) more complex than sphere or torus. If we wish to describe
the complexity of an object, it is not only the degree, but also the number of
monomials in the polynomials, which describe the curve or object. In the case of
Lamé curves, and the subset (with absolute values) the superellipses deﬁned by

variable. Gielis curves and surfaces generalize Lamé’s ideas for any symmetry
(integer and non-integer) and for any degree (including non-integer powers and
roots).

Such ﬁnite and short expansions can be named oligomials, a complete
description in a few (oligo) terms. The name oligomials ﬁrst appears in a text by V.
Arnold and O. Oleinik, where they expressed the need for a better way to describe
shape. “What is essential for the topological complexity of an object is not the
degree of the equation, but rather the number of monomials that appear in the
polynomial with nonzero coefﬁcients. Thus, we have the problem of oligomials, i.e.
the topology of objects speciﬁed by polynomials of arbitrarily large degree but with
a restricted number of monomials”.

Shape Complexity and Oligomials

Oligomials relate directly to the topology of the objects; they can be speciﬁed by
polynomials of arbitrarily large degree but with a restricted number of monomials.
Moreover, as in the case of Lamé and Gielis curves these monomials are single
variables, not geometric means. So we deﬁne complexity of shapes not in terms of
computability, but based on its pure mathematical expression, and hence arrive at a
suitable deﬁnition of geometric or topological complexity. And then our curves are
topologically simple because of their oligomial structure.

All Gielis Curves Are Equally Simple
Lamé, Rhodonea and many other curves and surfaces, all date back to the 18th and
19th century. In the history of science we have two opposite tendencies of shape
description. On the one hand we have the compact representations (Pythagoras, conic
sections, Lamé-Gielis, Grandi,….). They allowed for transforming geometrical
questions into simple equations (inspired by conic sections). On the other hand, we
had the development of inﬁnite series, such as Taylor and Fourier series. For practical
purposes such inﬁnite series are then truncated and referred to e.g. as Incomplete
Bessel functions. This is an old tradition in mathematics, since it is known that Fourier
series are modern versions of the computational techniques used by Ptolemy, as noted
by a 19th century Italian astronomer, Giovanni Schiaparelli [152].
Our goal is to deﬁne curves as compact as possible, either as a modern version of
the Pythagorean Theorem, or as a combination of a limited number of monomials.
Indeed, k-type curves are ﬁnite polynomials (or monomials), combining the power
of a compact and precise description, in one or a few terms, with the power of series
expansions. The background to deﬁning k-type curves is to develop ﬁnite type
curves, comparable to Fourier series [153]. Describing a wide variety of shapes has
hitherto been an intractable problem without resorting to inﬁnite series. An
immediate example: elliptic Fourier analysis allows for the description of very
complex shapes, including plant leaves (Fig. 6.20). One of the advantages of
Fourier is that it can handle very complex shapes including leaves [154].
The idea of k-types is based on k-ﬁnite type curves of Bang-yen Chen (in the
framework of submanifold theory). His k-type curves are of inﬁnite or of ﬁnite type,
depending on whether their Fourier expansion with respect to arc length is inﬁnite or
ﬁnite [155]. From this geometrical perspective, he proved that there is one and only
one closed curve that can be expressed in a ﬁnite Fourier series with respect to arc
length, and that is the circle itself. In fact, this theorem implies that the circle is the only
closed planar curve that is ofﬁnite type, namely of 1-type (1T) with all cosine and sine
terms equal to zero, but any other curve necessarily has a Fourier expansion of inﬁnite
type ð1TÞ. An alternative interpretation is that all curves other than the circle,
including the ellipses, are equally complex: once their Fourier expansion starts, it
never stops [156]. Their expansion contains inﬁnitely many terms ð1TÞ. Even the
200 harmonics to describe leaf shapes are a short version of the actual expansion.
Instead of inﬁnite series, however, truncated for practical reasons, direct
description of shape with Gielis curves provides a ﬁnite approach. This can be done
in the compact Pythagorean structure of Generalized Fourier series. When Gielis
curves are used as unit circles in a generalized Fourier series, i.e., on any term of a
classical Fourier series a Gielis transformation can act, any Gielis curve of 1T is
encoded directly, in one term only. They are of one-type (1T) and their expansion,
once it starts, stops immediately, since all cosine and sine terms are zero. Hence, all
Gielis curves, including the circle and Lamé curves, are equally simple; k-type
curves (with k > 1) are almost equally simple, in one or a few terms. Complexity
reduces to simplexity.
All Gielis Curves Are Equally Simple

Pythagorean-Compact and Pythagorean-Simple
One further way to reduce complexity to simplicity is to introduce the precise
notion of Pythagorean-compact description. The circle has its most compact
expression in polar coordinates. All circles can be represented by r ¼ R; all circles
are deﬁned by one number R which determines size, shape is ﬁxed. With
Pythagorean-compact we mean the description of size and shape in the same
compactness of the Pythagorean Theorem, the most compact way of representing
circles [129]. The expression r ¼ R however hides one important term, namely the
Gielis transformation for n = 2 and m = 4. In this case . #
ð Þ is not a radius with
variable length dependent on the angle, but ﬁxed since this term is equal to one.

Supershapes and Lamé curves in our polar representation clearly have the same
compact structure as the Pythagorean Theorem, with two perpendicular ways of
measuring spacing (cosine and sine), and size parameters R or A and B in terms of
ellipses. The main difference is the way of spacing the coordinates, governed by the
parameters m

Hence, the Gielis Formula is Pythagorean-compact, and our transformations
combine the compactness of the Pythagorean Theorem with its greatest advantage,
the orthogonality (independence) of its variables. Within the same structure and
same compactness we can deﬁne stretched radii and different spacing of angles,
when m
4 # is generalized to some f ð#Þ. So our formulas are topologically simple,
Pythagorean compact and Pythagorean simple. 2500 years after Pythagoras, we can
use the same structure not only to deﬁne circles but any supershape, abstract or
natural.

Embedded and Immersed
Lamé curves are not some strange specimen in the ﬁeld of mathematics.
Considering them as pure numbers—the outermost entries of any row of Pascal’s
Triangle—they are dual to the common “geometric mean” approach. Moreover,
Lamé-Gielis curves and surfaces are excellent methods for describing natural
shapes, to any degree of precision required. With this uniform description we have
found a way of making shapes commensurable with one way of measuring,
allowing us to compare a wide variety of abstract and natural shapes.
In this chapter we provide further examples of how Lamé curves and the Gielis
Formula arefullyimmersed and embeddedin theheart ofmathematics,withclear links
to some of the most well knownapplications of mathematics.It is surprising that it took
so longto discover,since everythingthat was needed to developtheGielisformula was
ready in the ﬁrst decades of the 19th century; not only ready in the sense that the
ingredients were available, but really ready. Had Gauss and Lamé joined forces in
1818, the year of seminal publications of both, most of the results and combinations
described in this book would have been known already two centuries ago.
Rigid and Semi-rigid Geometry

necessary to agree on some basic deﬁnitions and assumptions, many of which may

be very different from what we learned. Our Euclidean geometry is based on a
Euclidean circle, with all points on the circle at a ﬁxed distance from a ﬁxed center.
As humans we are free to roam in almost any direction (isotropy), and hence we can
easily deduce that if we walk in any direction we will arrive after the same interval
of time (“as the crow ﬂies”), at points that form a circle. This rigid Euclidean circle
is based on our own observations and perceptions of the world in which we are free
to move, at least ideally [157]. In fact, our current laws in physics are based on
isotropy.
As we know now, we have one transformation to describe many “anisotropic”
shapes as transformation of a unit circle. In our approach of transformations, the
notions of unit circle and rigidity of rulers play a crucial role. The notion of unit
circle or unit ball in nature can be very different from our classical Euclidean circle.
It is well understood in crystallography where the so-called Wulff shape provides
the unit ball for a given crystallographic conﬁguration, taking into account the
molecular structure and the directions of growth, like for example the snowﬂake.
Such unit balls introduce a natural anisotropy, with preferred directions of crystal
growth.
So, why do we call these shapes unit circles or unit balls, if the deﬁnition of a
circle is a “ﬁxed distance” away from a center? This is simply because our classic
circle is deﬁned in an isotropic way, with the ﬁxed distance as the crow ﬂies (in all
directions). To make this clear we can introduce the intuitive notion of semi-rigid
rulers. To draw a Euclidean circle, we keep a piece of chord stretched from the
center and trace out the circle. How do we draw a triangle then, a square, or any
supershape? The answer is simple: you take an elastic band, ﬁx it at a center and
start drawing. The key is to stretch the elastic band more, or less, in certain
directions. Then you can draw a starﬁsh or a pentagon [1].
How to stretch it in a certain direction depends on the precise values of our
transformations. We get another notion of distance from the center. In a very con-
trolled and precise way our elastic band becomes a semi-rigid ruler and in the same
way it is possible to construct a compass to trace out starﬁsh or pentagons. I use the
notion of semi-rigid to distinguish it from completely elastic as in topology. Squares,
circles and starﬁsh are topologically the same, but geometrically distinct. Our
(continuous) transformations provide a bridge between geometry and topology.
Now, we divide our elastic or semi-rigid ruler into ten equally spaced parts and
mark these with pegs (mathematically, we can imagine dividing an abstract line
segment into as many equal parts as we want). If you now would count the number
of pegs at 0° and 45° or at any angle you will always count the same number of
pegs, namely ten, whether you draw a circle, a square or a starﬁsh. This is obvious
because when the rulers stretch, so will its subdivisions, as shown in Fig. 7.1. The
number of pegs is always the same, irrespective of the angle and the endpoints will
always be a ﬁxed number of subdivisions away from the center and hence, by this
deﬁnition they lie on a circle.
This then provides an answer to a problem posed by Richard Feynman: “The
difference between being a circle and being nearly a circle is not a small difference.
It is a fundamental change so far as the mind is concerned. There is a sign of
110
7
Generalized Intrinsic and Extrinsic Lengths in Submanifolds

perfection and symmetry in a circle that is not there the moment the circle is slightly
off. That is the end of it; it is no longer symmetrical. Then the question is, why it is
only nearly a circle? That is a much more difﬁcult question. So our problem is to
explain where symmetry comes from: Why is Nature so nearly symmetrical? No one
has any idea why” [47].
The symmetry and the perfect object circle that Feynman refers to, ﬁnd their
origin in our ability to measure. From the earliest beginnings humans have chosen
to measure with ﬁxed distances, based on the rigid Euclidean circle. Nature on the
other hand works with semi-rigid rulers and allows any of its shapes or patterns to
have their own geometry. It is possible with our transformations to go from a circle
to a square or to a starﬁsh (and back) in a continuous way, and all such shapes will
remain unit circles. Since it is continuous, we can describe the smallest possible
changes, to discern among many very similar natural objects, like leaves on a tree.

Lorentz Transformations and SRT
If the “one-dimensional” observer on our elastic ruler would be you, then you
would not even notice that the ruler stretches or shortens, because your whole world
(the one dimensional line) will stretch or shorten, including yourself (Fig. 7.1). If
you, as the observer, would count the number of subdivisions, you would ﬁnd that
Fig. 7.1 Unit circles based on rigid and semi-rigid rulers. For illustrative purposes the observer is
depicted as a two-dimensional square, but one has to consider the one-dimensional line,
originating from a common center for each angle

111

at any angle, the intrinsic distances in your world remain constant. The observer in
Fig. 7.1, who is precisely one subdivision in size, will count precisely ten subdi-
vision in any direction, at all times.
We have two different viewpoints. From the classic Euclidean point of view,
these transformations deﬁne a unit circle as a deformation of the Euclidean unit
circle in which the radius is stretched or shortened. We can compute the stretching
(lengthening or shortening) of the radius from the associated transformations. From
the “intrinsic viewpoint” however, there is no stretching at all, for the observer on
the radius. Most importantly, neither of the two has a preference; both are valid
ways of measuring. If we insist on the Euclidean “ﬁxed” ruler, we hold on to
absolute deﬁnitions of distance and time. But they are a choice, not absolute.
In Special Relativity Theory a traveller A moving at high speeds will observe or
measure nothing special, while a static observer B will observe and measure
changes in A, and vice versa. Neither a ﬁxed ruler nor a stretched (elastic) one can
be considered as the “true measurement”, which is exactly the same situation as
described above, and it is in this sense that our formula can be considered as a
general framework for the Special Relativity Theory.
In Special Relativity Theory the Lorentz transformation tells how space and time
dilate and contract when one moves at uniform speeds. It is given by

and Poincaré transformations are based on a uniform motion along a line, but for
moving into isotropic spaces, trigonometric functions can be chosen.
This transformation may be considered as a special case of Eq. 5.9 in the fol-

called the chord. Since the sine function is deﬁned as half the chord, sin2# corre-

Fig. 7.2 one has a direct visual proof of this fact. In this way we convert circular
functions and motion into rectilinear motion (and back) as the Greek knew. Starting
from the hyperbola this may well be the shortest introduction to SRT. Once we
understand our semi-rigid rules it becomes crystal clear.

measure for natural shapes. But they are structurally the same.

to the next iteration. Gauss used this method for fast computations. For example,
M

can be computed up to 19 (!) decimal places in only four steps. From

so that m′ and n′ are, respectively, the arithmetic and geometric mean between m and

arithmetic-geometric mean between m and n. We will show that 1

This resonates with Lamé curves in polar representation. Remarkably the paper
of Gauss and Lamé’s book Examen were published in the same year 1818 and the
combination of both ideas could have led naturally to the Superformula. Indeed, if
Gauss had developed his transformations in a slightly different direction, using
general exponents like Lamé did, he would have arrived naturally at superellipses
(since the integrand of the Gauss form is an ellipse). Adding m/4, Gauss would have
arrived at the Superformula. If Lamé would have used Gauss’ polar version…
FRLM Geometry and FRLW Metrics
Gauss was very close to Gielis transformations in his study of the AGM, and so was
Gabriel Lamé (and even René Descartes with the Folium). For Lamé curves the
Euclidean metric is obtained for n = 2, whereby the length of a line is expressed
using Pythagoras’ theorem or

in differential form.
In his historical Habilitationsschrift Bernhard Riemann (1828–1868) generalized
Gauss’ work for surfaces to higher dimensional manifolds. At a certain point in the
text he mentions the possibility to use a fourth power instead of a square, to
measure distances on manifolds between two inﬁnitely close points,

Riemann’s view was studied ﬁfty years later by Paul Finsler [162] which led to
the development of Riemann-Finsler geometry with norms based on powers other
than two (as in the case of Riemannian geometry, or the Pythagorean measure).
A Theorem of Gauss and a Remarkable Year

Finsler manifolds are those for which the metric structure is given by a collection of
convex symmetric bodies in the various tangent spaces. For the Riemannian case it
is a (hyper) ellipsoid. There are already many applications of Finsler geometry in
physics and biology [163].
The simplest Riemann-Finsler metrics, for any dimension n and any power p, are
deﬁned as [12; 100]:

Minkowski created the formal tools to study problems about convex regions and
bodies. This led to Minkowski geometry, which is “the kind of geometry in which
lengths are measured differently in different directions… Unit circles and spheres
are not the familiar round objects from Euclidean geometry, but are some other
convex shape, called the unit ball” [28]. Cityblock L1, the Euclidean metric L2, and
the max norm L∞are well-known examples of pth root metric of Minkowski where
the unit circles are special cases of Lamé’s supercircles. A.C. Thompson discrim-
inates between Minkowski geometry and Minkowskian geometry, the latter related
to SRT. They can now be united. It would in my view be reasonable to refer to this
geometry, whatever its use or speciﬁcation (bodies, submanifolds, tangent
spaces….) as Finsler-Riemann-Lamé-Minkowski or FRLM geometry.
It was pointed out that Gielis transformations on functions, e.g. on the circle and
sphere, are quite alike the transformation on the Pythagorean metric to go from
Euclidean space to metrics for Riemannian spaces of constant curvature. An ‘iso-
tropic’ manifold or a space of constant curvature amounts to the axiom of free
mobility, whereby the lengths of rigid measuring rods are independent of their
locations in space. Riemann deﬁned such spaces using the metric:

The Pythagorean theorem deﬁnes the best-known example of a manifold of
constant curvature, namely circles and spheres. We now transform these circles and
spheres into a variety of spaces with a global anisotropy. However, the notion of
anisotropy (vis-à-vis isotropy) then needs rethinking because all transformed circles

(or n-spheres) are unit circles (or unit n-spheres) for certain classes of anisotropic
spaces.
One application of constant curvature surfaces is space-time models of the Big

with k = 0, 1 or −1 for the Euclidean, spherical/elliptical and hyperbolic case,
respectively, with a Pythagorean-compact metric.
Representing Dimensions
These metrics are given in R4 with local coordinates ðx; y; z; tÞ whereby the
space-slices of the full space-time at any given time t are Riemannian 3D-spaces of
constant curvature cðtÞ. By way of visualization in 2D rather than in 4D repre-
sentation, such metrics are carried for instance by surfaces of revolution in
3D-space. In space-time metrics like FLRW one may observe, on the one hand, the
conformal deformations of ﬂat space-metrics to metrics of constant spatial curvature
(=; < or > 0) and a hyperbolic twist in the line-direction, which might include a
speed of light-normalization, which all in all amount to formal deformations of the
theorem of Pythagoras quite alike the Gielis transformations relate to the equation
of Euclidean circles or spheres [12; 100].
It is noted that Gielis transformations also redeﬁne rotations and revolutions,
where paths swept by certain curves or surfaces can take any form as well and one
might easily imagine the extension to Riemann-Finsler metrics. The parametric
equation for 3D surfaces is known as a “spherical product” of two perpendicular
shapes. Originally this was proposed for superquadrics, but is now generalized for
supershapes, generalizing spherical coordinates in E3 and in E4 [164], and twisted
surfaces in E3 and E3
1 [120; 121].
With respect to four-dimensional space, this parametric description of 3D shapes
is based on two perpendicular sections (in the simplest case). A pyramid for
example has in one direction a triangle, in the perpendicular direction a square as
cross section (or a circle in the case of a cone). With both perpendicular 2D cross
sections based on our transformations, this provides two times two different pos-
sible measures or a total of four different directions. The planes can be real, com-
plex, or the combination thereof (R2  R2; R2  C or C  CÞ:
Only in the case of isotropic spaces, do (at least) two of these coincide, reducing
to our classical Cartesian or spherical coordinate system. The perpendicular planes
allow for different ways of measuring in four different directions, which may be

space or time, and which can vary in the course of movement or expansion in one or
more directions, with some form of normalization as needed.
Transformations in Euclidean Geometry
There are fundamentally three ways in which these transformations can be studied
or used. The ﬁrst two relate to the FRLM. The Lamé-Minkowski LM part relates to
the study of such shapes/transformations to deﬁne a geometry, like Minkowski
geometry which provide a fascinating study in their own right. These shapes can be
used to study the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of manifolds, as convex (or
concave) bodies in the tangent spaces or bundles, the Riemann-Finsler FR part.
Traditionally surfaces are treated as manifolds, studying the intrinsic properties
like Gaussian curvature. In the past 50 years, the ﬁeld of submanifolds has
developed rapidly, whereby manifolds can be considered as embedded in other
manifolds. The simplest example is to view manifolds in ambient Euclidean spaces.
An embryo inside an embryo sac can also be studied as submanifolds in manifolds,
which can be continued in any direction. Curvatures of the extrinsic geometry of
submanifolds include the mean curvature H ¼ AM ¼ k1 þ k2

Þ=2 and Casorati
curvature C ¼ k2



=2. These are related to the form or shape of the sub-
manifolds in their ambients spaces and the inequalities between curvatures of
intrinsic and extrinsic nature determine the natural curvature conditions. Our
transformation describes both the coordinate systems of the object, as well as the
space in which it lives, for example in Euclidean space, or in a sphere.
The third way is then indeed simply to consider our transformations in the
framework of Euclidean geometry and space, which immediately links geometry
with the natural sciences. The shapes can then be considered as embedded in a
Euclidean space [165]. L. Verstraelen states that: “By application of the corre-
sponding Gielis transformations to the “most natural” curves and surfaces of
Euclidean geometry (e.g., for dimension 2: the circles amongst the closed curves
and the logarithmic spirals amongst the non-closed curves), do result many of the
forms that we do observe in nature -in biology, cristallography, physics, chemistry,
etc.” [42].
The three ways are closely linked and in this sense Gielis may be considered as
an acronym for Generalized Intrinsic and Extrinsic Lengths In Submanifolds.
Generalized or Geometric, and Length refers to anything measurable. Nomen est
Omen.
In Chap. 3 it was shown how central the unit element is in Euclidean geometry,
for understanding differentiation, conic sections, series and special functions. In
nature this unit may differ depending on the direction. A speciﬁc transformation
(Eq. 5.8) is a generalization of Lamé curves and of the Pythagorean Theorem, and
if we would broaden the scope of Euclid’s deﬁnitions to include “our” unit circles
(which can be constructed using an elastic (or a spring) stretched according to Eqs.
118

Generalized Intrinsic and Extrinsic Lengths in Submanifolds

5.8 and 5.9 to draw any “unit” circle), many of the classic results in geometry and
extensions, might be obtained in a (relatively) simple way.
This is pretty similar to the situation one century ago: “What, then, has changed
with the work of Lorentz? Poincaré’s answer was that there are now two principles
that could serve to deﬁne space: the old one involving rigid bodies, and a new one
to do with the transformations that do not alter our differential equations. They are
not essentially different, because both are statements about objects around us, but
the new one is an experimental truth. To make geometry immune to revision by
experimenters, physical relativity must become a convention concerning distant
objects. Then, whereas our conventional knowledge of geometry was formerly
rooted in the group of Euclidean isometries, it could now be the Lorentz group that
preserves our equations, at the price of placing us in a four-dimensional space”
[158].
It provides a dual view on rigid and semi-rigid, both valid. Natural organisms
and shapes can be studied in their own geometry, and with immediate represen-
tation in ours with circles and circular functions. With different unit circles we
obtain different unit elements.
Unveiling the Secrets of Grandi Curves
Lamé-curves can describe natural shapes with square or rectangular symmetry. For
different (integer or non-integer) symmetries the Gielis Formula was developed and
transcendental functions were needed, since it was not possible to generalize Lamé
curves directly to any symmetry. Ultimately however, we would like to develop a
simple rule of going from Cartesian to polar coordinates and back (much in the
same way as the Folium of Descartes), without loss of generality for our shapes.
Would this be possible in any way? The answer is yes, and once more the secret lies
in trigonometric functions and their relation to description of ﬂowers.
The oldest and most useful mathematical representation of ﬂowers are Rhodonea
curves, discovered by Guido Grandi and communicated in a letter to Leibniz in
1713, three centuries ago [166]. In the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
Society, Guido Grandi’s A collection of Geometrical Flowers was published, on
January 1, 1722 [167]. Ultimately this resulted in Guido Grandi’s book Flores
geometrici ex Rhodonearum, et Cloeliarum curvarum descriptione resultantes of
1728 [168]. Clelia curves are the 3D analogues of Rhodonea curves (Fig. 7.3).
The observation that in Rhodonea or Grandi curves q ¼ cos m# or q ¼ sin m#
the arguments of the angle specify the frequency or number of petals was applied to
the polar representation of the Lamé curves or superellipses, which led to the
Superformula or Gielis Formula. The pivotal step to the superformula was rewriting
Lamé curves in polar coordinates and generalizing the symmetry from 4 to any
number, as in Grandi curves. The parameter m
4 aligns with the symmetries of the

shapes; pentagons, and starﬁsh are deﬁned with m ¼ 5, so that the orthogonal
coordinate system with right angles 90° is folded into ﬁve sectors of 72° each.
When m ¼ 5
2 the spacing between the sectors is 144° and the shape closes in two
rotations or 720°.
The superformula in its original form makes use of transcendental functions.
What hitherto was missing is the reverse step, namely to express such shapes in
Cartesian coordinates, to convert the transcendental functions into rational func-
tions. This can be achieved using Chebyshev polynomials introduced by Pafnuty
Chebyshev in the mid 19th century [169; 170]. We mentioned these curves already
a few times. There is a close relationship between Chebyshev polynomials and
many classic trigonometric identities.
Using x ¼ cos #; they allow the study of polynomials with transcendental
functions as algebraic functions in one variable.
Chebyshev polynomials of ﬁrst kind T and second kind U of order n are deﬁned

In this way it can be shown that for a suitable choice of parameters (exponents
n and symmetry parameter m are integers) the superformula is an algebraic

expression avoiding transcendent functions. It aligns perfectly with our goal to
deﬁne compact, yet precise descriptions. The word precise is what it is meant to
mean: precise and accurate. This inverse step is based on the simple observation
that Grandi curves q ¼ cos m# ARE Chebyshev functions of the ﬁrst kind
Tm x
ð Þ ¼ cos m#.
If we wish to frame it into taxonomical language: “Research has shown that
Rhodonea cleliae and Polynomia oligomiae, considered as very different species
since they were ﬁrst described, not only belong to the same genus (Grandia), but
they are the same species and even the same cultivar”. A letter of 300 years ago, in
which Guido Grandi communicated to Leibniz the discovery of Rhodonea curves,
inspired both the development of the superformula in polar coordinates and gen-
eralized Pythagorean Theorem in 1997, as well as the inverse transformation into
Chebyshev polynomials two decades later, closing the loop. From this we can build
k-type curves and polynomials (oligomials) of order k, without having to resort to
inﬁnite series.
Orthogonial Polynomials and Phyllotaxy in Plants
With further generalizations (for example multivariate and multi-argument poly-
nomials), a wide variety of natural and abstract shapes can now be considered as
algebraic functions (for appropriate choice of parameters) with a one-on-one
transformation polar-Cartesian. Once more, all the ingredients were available in the
19th century, a time when mathematics had a very close interaction with practice.
Orthogonal polynomials were developed by Chebyshev from 1854 onwards, based
on practical considerations of mappings and best-possible approximations of
curves. The success was also based on the close interaction with his friend and
colleague Charles Hermite, and his student Markov.
This French connection was no coincidence because of the close connection
between Paris and Saint-Petersburg and the emphasis on combining theory and
practice. Gabriel Lamé had been a professor in Saint-Petersburg from 1820–1830
[171]. When considering trigonometric functions and Chebyshev polynomials,
there is a direct connection to cosine Fourier series (or sine Fourier series), and thus
to the many applications in modern technology, such as .jpeg format for com-
pressing images, and the .mp3 format for compressing music.
Returning to botany and phyllotaxy: there is a complete and direct correspon-
dence between our curves and Fibonacci and Lucas numbers and polynomials.
There is a direct relation between Chebyshev polynomials and Lucas Ln and
Fibonacci numbers Fn and their wide use in plant phyllotaxy. They can all be
considered as special cases of the homogeneous linear second order difference
equation with constant coefﬁcients u0; u1; un þ 1 ¼ aun þ bun1, for n  1 [172].

obtain Chebyshev polynomials. They are of the ﬁrst kind Tn x
ð Þ for u0 ¼ 1; u1 ¼ x,
and of the second kind UnðxÞ for u0 ¼ 1; u1 ¼ 2x.
Therefore, if in Chebyshev polynomials i ¼

are Lucas numbers Ln for Chebyshev polynomials of the ﬁrst kind Tn, and
Fibonacci numbers Fn for those of the second kind Un.

This also clariﬁes the direct relation between Fibonacci and Lucas numbers, with
the geometry of phyllotaxy given by Eq. 5.8 with m a rational number (m = 5/2,
8/3, for example… Fn + 2/Fn). These give the number of angles in the numerator
and the number of rotations needed to close, as the inverse of the generally used Fn/
Fn + 2 in phyllotaxy. As a remark, instead of starting from a ﬁnite difference
equation, one can generalize complex numbers and derive Chebyshev polynomials
in this way.
Grandi and Gielis curves take the study of plants and natural organisms further
into the realms of the three pillars of mathematics, namely geometry, algebra and
analysis. Our goal of developing compact representations of natural shapes is
achieved, either using the Superformula or the inverse transformation via
Chebyshev polynomials. We now can express a wide variety of natural and abstract
shapes using monomials, which may be of different nature. Furthermore, the ana-
lytic expression immediately suggests a generalization in two ways: First the
classical transformation x ¼ cos # can be generalized with x ¼ cos f ð#Þ, where f #

can involve a time component. Second, using the coordinate functions of
supershapes,

Generalized Intrinsic and Extrinsic Lengths in Submanifolds

In this way we retain the Pythagorean-compact expression, but we can use
transcendental functions or rational ones. In this way we close the scheme, started
by generalizing Lamé in polar coordinates, and ﬁnalized by rewriting it in
Chebyshev polynomials (Fig. 7.4). For a suitable choice of parameters, the shapes
deﬁned by Eq. 5.8 can then be treated as rational functions.
Grandi-curves provide the common descent for both a uniform description of
natural shapes in a very broad sense, and for various mathematical-geometrical
methods. For this class of shapes we have the choice of three expressions. First, in a
Pythagorean structure, second as an inﬁnite series, via e.g. Fourier series or Taylor
series expansion or similar, and third as a ﬁnite polynomial. This means that we can
switch between Cartesian coordinates and transcendental trigonometric functions,
with many applications in science and technology.

En résumé, lorsqu’une classe de phénomènes physiques dépend
des variations d’un certaine fonction-de-point, c’est presque
uniquement par son paramètre différentiel du second ordre que
cette fonction intervient. Comme si ce paramètre était une
dérivée naturelle, plus essentielle, plus simple, et en même
temps plus complète, que toutes les dérivées partielles, choisis
plus ou moins arbitrairement, que’on a l’habitude de
considérer.

Harmonic and Metaharmonic Solutions
All plant-shapes generated by one deterministic L-system are identical, so
stochastic L-systems were introduced in order to produce more variation. The
drawback is that, when a desired plant shape is given, one cannot ﬁnd, in an
algorithmic or otherwise mathematically precise way, the L-system that will gen-
erate it [94]. This is true for fractals, supershapes, R-functions or any other model
(and in all of science). A plant however, is more than meets the eye. It is a complex
organism, the result of the precise interplay between geometry, genes and enzymes,
and many other substances and metabolites, growing in speciﬁc climatic and
edaphic conditions, subject to many biotic and abiotic factors, prone to diseases and
in need of pollinators, with limited or abundant availability of water, light and
nutrients. Its genetic constitution is the result of million years of evolution at work
and has incorporated all mechanisms necessary to develop and grow successfully.
Hence, our model needs to be much more than a virtual plant that looks nice (see
Fig. 6.8). The model we need is that of an “abstract plant”, not a virtual plant, where
certain model-parts are controlled by suitable parameters. Plants are continuously
communicating with an ever-changing environment where macro and micro-effects
interact and the parameters in the abstract plant enable us to measure the effect of
these interactions, hence introducing parameters and choosing values of them with
the aim of obtaining a virtual plant resembling a given specimen contradicts our

aim. Our “abstract” plant in the study of the morphogenesis is a time sequence of
adaptations to internal and external stresses acting on the plants. The model con-
structed should be generic, i.e. free of in-built constraints depending on results or
theories contained in those to be tested in the actual research [94]. An abstract tree
will be different from an abstract cactus, but the mathematical model underlying
both is the same.
One of the advantages of our model is a continuous transformation. A plant is a
combination of transitional forms: cotyledons, vegetative leaves and their poly-
morphism, sepals, petals, stamen and pistils are all variations and transitions of
leaves. This resonates well with Goethe’s studies of plants: Alles ist Blatt, und
durch diese Einfachheit wird die grösste Mannigfaltigkeit möglich. “Everything is
Leaf, and from this simple fact, the greatest diversity becomes possible”.

ment in the widest sense, and then the actual shape will depend upon the extrinsic
characteristics. Actual shapes are a result of the interplay between the intrinsic and
extrinsic characteristics, striving towards equilibrium, static or dynamic. The way
soap bubbles and soap ﬁlms form and stabilize as a dynamical process, is the result
of such interplay. Because of the isotropic nature of soap the molecules are pretty
free to organize themselves minimizing stress along the surface, or at least distribute
the stress as evenly as possible. The shape of a soap bubble and soap ﬁlm is in this
sense very similar to chords of a guitar, or a drum: once set into motion, the most
natural tendency is to go back to static equilibrium. The study of minimal surfaces
and dynamic equilibria are governed by differential equations, the heart of physics.
Again, Gabriel Lamé was at the forefront of these developments, following in
the footsteps of among others Euler and Laplace. In his book Coordonnées
Curvilignes he introduced the differential parameters of the ﬁrst D1 (or r) and
second kind D2 (or D). The latter is the Laplacian, and it is central in potential
theory, heat distribution, plate vibrations, the wave equation and so on. It is directly
related to the mean curvature H on the surface. The Laplacian is a crucial ingredient
of many partial differential equations, such as the equations of Laplace, Poisson and
Helmholtz, the wave and Schrödinger equations. In polar coordinates:

In the words (and notation) of Gabriel Lamé:

In the analytic theory of heat, the temperature V is determined by the equations:

In the mathematical theory of elasticity of homogeneous solids, the cubic dilatation
h is determined by the equations:

dt2 ¼ a2D2h

The proper selection of the displacement of molecules and the components of
elastic forces in steady state all follow the equations
D2D2F ¼ 0
In summary, when a class of phenomena in physics depends on variations of a
certain point-to-point function, it is almost always through its second order dif-
ferential parameter that this function operates, as if this parameter is the most
natural, most essential, simplest and at the same time the most complete, of all
partial derivatives, that one has the habit to consider, but the choice is more or less
arbitrary.
Lamé developed deep insights in mathematical physics with far-reaching con-
sequences up to the present day. Lamé envisaged that, from a mathematical point of
view, the study of a physical system amounts to the study of a system of curvilinear
coordinates, adapted to the given physical situation. The mathematical world of
curvilinear coordinates is then like a model of the world of physical systems. René
Guitart remarks: “The importance of the general idea of considering all curvilinear
coordinate systems, and not only the four or ﬁve known (Cartesian, oblique,
cylindrical, spherical, bipolar) around 1830 is really considerable. One may
compare this with Descartes, who instead of only 10 or 12 curves, known in Ancient
times, passed over into a real inﬁnitude of curves meant to represent physical
systems” [85].
Gaston Darboux wrote, in his overview of 19th century geometry: “At this
moment, one of the most penetrating of geometers, according to the judgement of
Jacobi, Gabriel Lamé, who, like Charles Sturm had commenced with pure geom-
etry and … rising to the idea of curvilinear coordinates in spaces, became the
creator of a wholly new theory destined to receive in mathematical physics the most
varied applications” [173].
The study of a physical problem, adapted with the appropriate system of
curvilinear coordinates, then becomes the characterization of the system of differ-
ential invariants, which equals the calculation of the Laplacian in curvilinear
coordinates. In Lamé’s view only one equation then needs to be calculated, namely
the Poisson equation in curvilinear coordinates with boundary conditions. Other
Harmonic and Metaharmonic Solutions

equations and laws are reduced to special cases. It is very relevant for botany as
well. Paul B. Green envisioned combining calculus and development in plants and
plant organs, in which solutions to the differential equations generated local devi-
ations resulting in organs, e.g. stamens or petals in a ring or whorl [174].
Gielis curves and surfaces carry natural curvilinear coordinate systems adapted
to the system under study, reminiscent of Gabriel Lamé’s Unique Rational Science.
Lamé’s Science Rationelle Unique, Universal Natural Shapes, and a geometrical
theory of morphogenesis all resonate along the same lines of providing a geo-
metrical picture of the world. Universal Natural Shapes give a unifying and
coherent geometrical way of measuring and modeling shapes in line with the views
of Lamé, Riemann and Helmholtz on science.
The Mathematical Physics Project of Fourier
The memoir of Jean-Baptiste Fourier aimed at providing a solution to a speciﬁc
problem in mathematical physics, the heat equation, using circular trigonometric
functions [175]. René Thom wrote that the applications of mathematics in the
science in almost all cases use pre-existing mathematical results. The work of
Fourier was for him the only counterexample in science. It is rooted in physics and
Fourier developed his own, original methods using trigonometric functions based
on the circle. To put this in perspective: Newton had succeeded in determining the
curvature of any planar curve, using osculating circles in any point, and the radius
of these circles became the measure of curvature. This then, could be linked
directly, up to a constant, to mechanical forces in nature. In one stroke, Fourier
provided a global determination of curves and functions, using a sum of a circle and
circular functions (Fourier series). It was groundbreaking work, to say the least,
generalizing the solution of vibrating strings (1D in a 2D domain) in terms of
harmonics, for planar domains in 3D Euclidean spaces.
Despite the widespread use of Fourier series in science it remained an open
problem whether the idea of Fourier to approximate functions with any degree of
precision using Fourier series was valid. It was only in 1966 that Lennart Carleson
could prove the point-wise convergence of Fourier series, almost everywhere,
except in points of measure zero.
This settled a long-standing problem, but it did not complete Fourier’s project on
mathematical physics. The original problem was a quadruple of a boundary value
problem BVP, boundary conditions BC (Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin), a given
function on the boundary BF, and a domain D, and the solution in terms of Fourier
series. Since Fourier series make use of trigonometric functions, the solution was
found on a circular domain, but for the next two centuries analytical solutions
remained possible only for a few domains, since one lacked a general method to
reduce regular and irregular shapes to circles or circular functions. A variety of
130

methods were developed, very few analytic, most numerical, but none of these
methods could use the classical Fourier projection method.
Solving BVP with Fourier Series
It was only in 2007, exactly 200 years after Fourier’s original memoir that it was
shown that the solution of Boundary Value Problems for any normal polar domain
could be expressed in Fourier series. P.E. Ricci, P. Natalini and D. Caratelli gen-
eralized the Laplacian, using the Gielis transformation to transform any domain into
a circle, and obtained Fourier solutions for a variety of canonical problems in
mathematical physics [176, 177]. The domains not only included normal polar
planar domains, but also 3D domains and Riemann surfaces. Later these solutions
were extended to annular domains and shells.
Since the original paper in 2007, solutions using only 19th century mathematics
[Fourier series, Bessel (ﬁrst described by Fourier) and Hankel functions] have been
obtained for heat, wave, Laplace, Poisson and Helmholtz equations, under various
boundary conditions on 2D and 3D domains, using the classical Fourier projection
method [178–181]. A list of the most important boundary value problems (see
Lamé’s list):
• Wave equation

• Heat propagation

• Laplace equation

• Helmholtz equation
Dv þ k2v ¼ 0
• Schrödinger’s equation

The solutions are based on the generalization of the Laplacian for stretched
coordinate systems. How this works will be illustrated for the Laplace equation for
a ﬂying bird domain [134], and for the Helmholtz equation in relation to plate
vibrations.

The Laplace equation is the simplest of boundary value problems, describing the
behaviour of a domain that is perturbed and wants to return to rest. To counteract
stress on the surface, the surface reacts by breaking up the stress into harmonics to

return to zero stress as soon as possible. This is a very important equation in the
whole of mathematical physics, as application of the laws of Newton. For example
trees and plants have trunks, branches, and leaves to deal with stress imposed by
wind, rain and snow. The trunk will absorb the low frequencies, while the highest

frequencies are neutralized as much as possible by ﬂuttering leaves [182, 183]. The
structure of wood inside a tree is a silent witness of the past weather conditions to
which the tree had to adapt its shape continuously. Plants are very well adapted to
weather conditions: the inﬂorescence of grasses manages to create eddy currents
around its ﬂorets to catch pollen carried by the wind, as shown by Karl J. Niklas
using a stroboscope, brilliant in its simplicity [184] (it was this work that made me
decide to go into plant research).
In such conditions however, the stress is not a one time applied force, like
plucking a string, but it is continuously or discontinuously changing over time. The
next best thing for an object to deal with stress is to align it with functions that
remain pretty invariant under change. The trigonometric and exponential functions
are ideal for this. So ﬁnding a solution in terms of trigonometric functions or
exponential functions is an important quest in mathematical physics.
Many problems of mathematical physics with partial differential equations
involving time and space featuring the Laplacian, are described by the Helmholtz
equation Dv þ k2v ¼ 0, or Dv ¼ k2v. This important equation is used to study
problems in electromagnetism, acoustics and vibrations etc. Many other problems
can be reduced to Helmholtz equation: for example, plate vibrations involving a
fourth order Laplacian or reaction-diffusion systems, can be solved using two
independent Helmholtz equations. A hyperbolic equation, like the wave equation,
can be transformed into Helmholtz using the Laplace transform. Through the wave
equation, there is a direct link between the Helmholtz and Schrödinger equations.
Once more, we strive for an exact solution in terms of Fourier series. The “exact”
solution of many classical Boundary Value Problems in terms of Fourier series can
be achieved, where “exact” means that we can approximate a prescribed ﬁnite
number of coefﬁcients of the Fourier expansion of the solution as closely as we
wish. This is in line with the goal that we stated: describe the shapes or phenomena
in terms of conic sections (or Lamé-Gielis generalizations) and develop methods
using simple, circular functions.

The stretched Laplacian can be applied to any domain, in particular our Gielis
domains. The solution in terms of Fourier expansions then becomes possible using
separation of variables, a very classical technique, but until recently only applicable
in a limited number of cases, the circle being the most illustrious example. The
genius of Pythagoras was that he deﬁned the circle in a way that directly allowed for
separation of variables, since the coordinate functions, sine and cosine are
orthogonal. This led to the great success of orthogonal and orthonormal functions,
including Legendre functions, Fourier series, Bessel, Hankel and Hermite-
Chebyshev functions. The Gielis formula retains the Pythagorean structure, so
separation of variables is ensured from the start.
The Laplacian is a very important ingredient of any study of nature. Natural
objects, dealing with stress applied by the environment have their speciﬁc ways of
dealing with this stress (avoiding it or incorporating it in their growth) and the
Laplacian used in Laplace, Helmholz, Poisson, Schrödinger or similar equations of
mathematical physics, is key to the study of such problems, ranging from vibrating
strings and drums to vibrating plates and elementary particles, in space or in space
and time.
Dealing with stress, natural objects not only divert stresses, but can also
incorporate stress into their structure. One example is the “ﬂower” structure in the
test of sand dollars; this shape is directly related as curvature to the overall shape of
the sand dollar. In biology one of the most prominent examples are “the spots of the
leopard”, whereby genes and gene actions are spatially distributed. The break-
through in biology and chemistry was Alan Turing’s paper, The Chemical Basis of
Morphogenesis [186]. In Turing’s vision two coupled non-linear reaction-diffusion
equations model the spatiotemporal movement of the concentration of two mor-
phogens. The stable equilibrium of a system can be disrupted by a diffusion driven
instability, when in a system there is inﬂux and outﬂux of chemicals. This

instability turns into spatio-temperal patterning, resulting in the spots of dogs and
leopards, the stripes of zebra’s and tigers, the patterns on mollusc shells (Fig. 8.4)
and the patterns and spots on ﬂowers of Asclepiads (Fig. 8.5).
It is not surprising then that the Turing equations (reaction-diffusion) can be
written as two Helmholtz equations [187]. The coupling is more intricate than in the
case of plate vibrations, but the underlying structure is the same. This is also why
we focused on the general solution of the Helmholtz equations, rather than purely
plate vibrations. Solutions to Laplace equations are called harmonic solutions, those
for Helmholtz equations are called metaharmonic solutions [188].
R-Functions Revisited
Earlier we used R-functions to combine domains, a beautiful combination of logic
and geometry; one of Rvachev books is called Methods of Logic Algebra in
Mathematical Physics (1974). The origin of R-functions however, is not in geo-
metric modeling, but in approximation theory, in particular in solutions for
boundary value problems [136-138]. In 1958 Kantorovic and Krylov had proposed

that the product of two functions, on the one hand a real-valued function x having
speciﬁed numerical values (e.g. zero) as value on the boundary and positive within
the boundary, and on the other hand an unknown function U that allows to satisfy
the differential equation (exact or as approximation), could be used to represent the
solution to that differential equation [189].
Solutions of a differential equation with these boundary conditions can be rep-
resented in the form u ¼ xU. This was shown as a general theorem, but how to
construct such functions and how to generalize to other boundary value problems,
was left as an open challenge. Rvachev proposed that R-functions could answer
both questions. R-functions behave as continuous analogs of logical Boolean
functions (but are broader), and functions could be constructed with the desired
differential properties and potential ﬁelds. Rvachev’s solution thus addressed both
challenges suggested by Kantorovic’ general theorem. R-functions are guaranteed
to give solutions to the boundary value problem at hand.
One major advantage of deﬁning geometric domains in this way is that the
solutions can be computed in every point on and within the domain, in two and
three dimensions. This avoids the need of meshing and spatial discretization of
domains, surfaces and bodies; this has been implemented in a mesh-free modeling
system in computer-aided design and engineering and has been called semi-analytic
geometry [138]. The development for mesh-free methods is one of the holy grails of
analysis; Fourier’s methods worked for a circular disk and a few other domains, but
the development of solutions for other domains relied on discretization and
approximations. In the absence of exact or analytic methods (in the sense of
Fourier), ﬁnite difference methods (e.g. ﬁnite elements) have been developed and
arguably the development of all design and engineering software is a result of the
lack of an exact method. R-functions provided such methods.
By using supershapes and our Fourier projection method we also obtain both
geometric domains and solutions structures. We make use of Fourier’s method on
separation of variables, namely solutions are sought as u q; #

of the Laplace equation. Consequently, we have two immediate applications of the
usefulness of the Generalized Fourier Series: the description of domains and the
solutions to boundary value problems with low order of expansion.
Rvachev functions were a solution to Kantorovich and Krylov’ general theorem.
We can now align Gielis curves and surfaces to such advances and theorems,
generalizing Fourier’s original method to any normal polar domain, or as solution
to Kantorovich’ Theorem, whereby the classical trigonometric functions and our
shapes give both the functions and the solutions. Open challenges are to ﬁnd

Natural Curvature Conditions
What astonishes and bewilders me most is the scale on which
Nature uses the Superformula. The search for mathematical
formulas that can describe biological forms is an old one. The
Gielis Formula makes it possible to describe an almost
unimaginable number of natural shapes in a very simple way.
One of the next challenges will be to analyze which mechanism
allows organisms to use this formula for shaping its organs and
bodies. And especially what we can learn from it. I am
convinced that the use of this formula will also lead to an
avalanche of technological breakthroughs and practical
applications.

Curvature, the Central Notion in Geometry
Curvature, in all of its aspects is at the core of geometry. Going straight is central to
geometry, but it is also a ﬁction, since we live in a curved world with gravitational
attraction in landscapes of mountains, valleys and planes. Nevertheless it is a very
useful ﬁction, and the basis of Euclidean geometry and modern science. How then
to deﬁne being curved, intrinsically and/or as a deviation from planarity? This is
one of the central questions in mathematics and geometry; we have derived
Euclidean geometry, one geometry that is in accordance with our intuition and our
position on earth (with its gravitational ﬁeld). René Thom: “Classical Euclidean
geometry can be considered as magic; at the price of minimal distortion of
appearances (a point without size, a line without width) the purely formal language
of geometry describes adequately the reality of space” [9].
If we ride our bike on a long, straight and ﬂat road, we can maintain a constant
speed. When the road turns, the force we experience is directly related to the
curvature of our turn; force F is acceleration a times a constant (in this case mass,
F ¼ m : a) and acceleration is curvature of the trajectory. We may need to slow
down.

If no force had been applied, we would have continued in a straight line,
eventually drifting off into space in an ideal world. A traveller along a curve or path
risks at any point going straight, along the tangent line, which can be deﬁned
analytically in each point P. The traveller is kept on the path or traces out a path due
to external forces; one example is a projectile following a parabolic curve.
Curvature going beyond P is then deﬁned by how much the path deviates from the
tangent in a point P. The deviation from this line is measured as an angle between
curve and tangent.
The curvature of curves in the Euclidean plane was determined analytically
around 1670 by Isaac Newton, via osculating circles. Newton showed analytically
that in each point of the curve, a circle can be applied, which is a direct measure of
the deviation from this line. The radius R of the osculating circle gives this measure,
and curvature itself is the inverse j ¼ 1
R. If the curve makes a sharp turn, the cur-
vature is high; if the turn is gentle, curvature is low. How the circle is applied to the
curve is also well-deﬁned: the normal direction, which contains P and the centre C of
the oscullating circle, is perpendicular to the tangent line. If we know the tangent, we
automatically know along which line the centre of the circle of curvature is to be
found. When we know not only the curvature in one point, but of the whole curve,
we have the fundamental theorem of plane curves in Euclidean geometry: The
knowledge of the curvature completely determines the curve. Stated differently,
curves with the same curvature are the same, and differ only in position [190].
Moving in Space
In geometry the deﬁnition of curvature is in the Oresme tradition a point-wise, local
operation and this can also be used for curves in space. In each point of a curve in a
plane a best ﬁtting circle can be ﬁtted, and this is called the osculating circle, and
the orientation of the circle is deﬁned by the normal, perpendicular to the tangent,
and this circle is in the osculating plane [191]. For any point on a 3D curve, we can
also deﬁne a tangent in space, and also here the direction of the osculating circle can
be deﬁned by the perpendicular direction to the tangent (Fig. 9.1).
In space this plane is one of the three planes, the other being the rectifying plane
R spanned by
t; b
f
g and the binormal plane, spanned by
n; b
f
g. The binormal
vector is perpendicular to the tangent and the normal vector. In this sense the
binormal deﬁnes a ‘third dimension’, so that in each point P we can ﬁt an XYZ
coordinate system, the orientation of which is ﬁxed by the direction of the tangent
and normal. In fact the Serret-Frenet-Pagani equations give the exact relations
t0 ¼ jn;
n0 ¼ jt þ sb;
b0 ¼ sn
ð9:1Þ
These equations deﬁne curvature j as the ratio t0
n and torsion s as the ratio  b0
n
with t0 and b0 denoting the change in t and b with respect to arc length. Both j and s
146

are measures of curvature. In the early history of the curvature of curves, j and s
were called “double courbure”. The fundamental theorem for planar curves can be
extended: Knowledge of j and s completely determines a 3D curve.
They are connected through the Darboux vector. If one moves through space on
a curve with s the time parameter, then the moving frame
t; n; b

accordance with the Serret-Frenet-Pagani equations. This motion contains, apart
from an instantaneous translation, an instantaneous rotation with angular velocity

Moving on Curves on Surfaces
On curves one has considerable freedom to move. For surfaces to be coherent, the
double curvatures reduce to the maximum and minimum curvature j1 and j2,
respectively. These are the maxima and minima of an inﬁnite number of curvatures.
For surfaces the situation was clariﬁed due to the work of Euler and Meusnier,
who developed the notion of principal curvature. The principle is very similar to
curves, but now we study the tangent plane in a point P on a surface; magic starts to
happen. First, we can draw inﬁnitely many tangents through the point P since in
space there are an inﬁnite number of directions. Since all these tangents lie in one
plane, all normal directions, deﬁned as lines perpendicular to the tangent, coincide.
The curvature in all directions will be different in general (unless the surface is a
sphere) but all radii of curvature lie along the normal direction, and all centers of all
the osculating circles, lie on that normal. Among these radii of curvature, there will

and binormal vectors and

147

be a maximal value jmax ¼ j1, and a mimimal value jmin ¼ j2. Now comes the real
magic: one of the most amazing results in geometry and mathematics is that for
surfaces the maximal and minimal curvatures are in perpendicular normal planes!
(Fig. 9.2).
At a point P we can draw an inﬁnite number of planes having the normal as
common line. In each plane a curve can be ﬁtted to point P with curvature of that
curve in the point P deﬁned in the sense of Newton’s osculating circles. There are
two distinct planes, one with the maximal curvature j1, the other with the minimal
curvature j2 and amazingly, they turn out to be perpendicular. This is one of the
true gems of geometry (one of many). All other curvatures jn in P in any (normal)
direction can be determined from j1 and j2, since these are perpendicular:
jnð#Þ ¼ j1cos2# þ j2sin2#. So one can draw an ellipse of curvature to visualize
the various values of jn:
Once we know the principal curvatures, they can be combined via the classical
means of the Ancient Greek. The arithmetic mean of jmax ¼ j1 and jmin ¼ j2 gives
the mean curvature H ¼ j1 þ j2
2
and the square of the geometric mean is the Gaussian
curvature K ¼ j1 : j2. The Gaussian curvature is technically deﬁned as the ratio of
a surface area of a small parallelogram drawn on that surface to the image of the
area developed on a sphere. This is in line with Newton’s curvature for a curve,
based on the approximation with an oscullating circle. It is also pointwise, but now
approximated with a sphere; as the areas converge to a point, the limit of the ratios
of these area is equal in value to the product of the principal radii.
In this way differential geometry (geometry in the small) became fully embedded
in mainstream mathematics, giving rise to various deﬁnitions of curvature, relations
between curvatures, Laplacians etc., all central in the application of mathematics in
the natural sciences. One remark (and we refer to Laplacian, and the remark of
Schrödinger): technically only second order contributions of curvature are taken
into account and higher order contributions are neglected.
Another important remark is that the experience of curvature in the above sense
does not always correspond with our intuition and perception. Going with or against
the wind, or climbing a mountain or sliding downward, or anything anisotropic (at
least from our point of view) our experiences will differ. These are challenges

which require new points of view, like Minkowski and Finsler geometries, based on
Lamé curves or on Lamé curves or Gielis transformations.
Notwithstanding this, everything works excellent: we have a straight line,
connected with tangents, as ﬁrst derivative, and we have the circle, connected with
curvature and the second derivative. These are the main tools for our study of
natural shapes and phenomena. Almost everything of importance in geometry can
be reduced to the study of the relations between these tools. One example which we
will discuss further is the angle between position vector and tangent vector, which
in natural shapes tends to be constant.
K and H are the most commonly known measures, but to describe shape, two
other measures of curvature (or curvedness) are also extremely useful. First is the
Casorati curvature C, the arithmetic mean of the squares of principal curvatures
[192]:
C ¼ j2
1 þ j2

ð9:3Þ
The rationale for this curvature is some strange consequences of K and H. A
cylinder, deﬁnitely curved in our eyes, has Gaussian curvature K zero since the
minimal curvature is zero (and hence the product). This holds for all developable
surfaces; fold a ﬂat piece of paper into a cylinder or a cone, and the Gaussian
curvature is still zero, because one of the principal curvatures is zero. The mean
curvature H is not perfect either to describe curvedness: for minimal surfaces (e.g. a
clearly curved catenoid) H is zero. So, while Gaussian or mean curvature vanishes
for surfaces that look intuitively curved (like a cylinder), the Casorati curvature
C only vanishes at planar points. This is not a perfect solution either since the
Casorati curvature of sphere and catenoid is the same, as Eugène Catalan remarked
in a letter (1891) to Felix Casorati [193]. Indeed, in catenoid and sphere j1 ¼ j2 but
in a catenoid j1 and j2 have opposite signs. The square root of the Casorati
curvature has been proposed as a measure of curvedness [194].
The Shape Index r of Jan Koenderink and Andrea van Doorn, is a really
excellent way of describing how surfaces are curved in space, with a beautiful
geometric meaning [194].

Natural Curvature Conditions and Ideal Submanifolds
For mathematics and its applications we can then search for optimal relations
between curvatures or extremals of these scalar-valued characteristics. From the
point of view of optimal relations, we have already mentioned the inequality
Moving on Curves on Surfaces

K  H2. Minimizing H or H2 is one way to strive for equality in the classical
inequality K  H2 as one of the driving forces of nature, with equality K ¼ H2 ¼ 0
attained in minimal surfaces, as in catenoids and planes. It is important to under-
stand the product of principal curvatures K as an intrinsic characteristic, whereas
H is an extrinsic characteristic of shape.
Inequalities give a dynamic character: in soap bubbles, the environment is
always changing, and microscopically the soap molecules continuously adapt their
conﬁgurations to comply with these changes and keep some constant relation
between inside and outside pressure. This can be noticed by the continuously
changing thickness of the bubble, accounting for the colorful patterns of soap
bubbles, and how they move across the surface. The equality is not a given, it is a
continuous dynamic process of striving towards or optimizing conﬁgurations. All in
all however, the inequality K  H2 is nothing but the inequality between the square
of the geometric mean, and the arithmetic mean of the principal curvatures, a
beautiful application of the relations that the Greek discovered between numbers in
a arithmetical and geometrical way. Unlike for positive numbers only where the
inequality is strict GM\AM, curvatures can be negative and equality can be
achieved. The geometrically natural curvature conditions study, in their simplest
form, the constancy of curvatures like the extrinsic curvature, expressed by the
mean curvature H (expressing uniform surface tension) and the intrinsic curvatures,
expressed by Gauss curvature K for surfaces M in Euclidean 3D-space.
The other strategy is ﬁnding extremals in curvatures (intrinsic or extrinsic).
Finding extremals of H2 is a natural choice, embodied in the Willmore functional:
R
H2dA on closed surfaces in 3 dimensional space. These extremals can then be
used in inequalities: the Willmore Theorem states that this functional  4p with
equality (and thus a minimum) for the round sphere. The natural problem is to ﬁnd
out what the minima are when the surfaces have additional constraints, topologi-
cally or metrically [195]. This ﬁnds applications in biology as the Helfrich energy
for membranes. The cell membrane is the boundary between a living cell and its
environment. It is a surface connecting the inner with the outer and so we search for
optimal relations between outer and inner characteristics of shapes. Instead of using
the mean curvature, it uses H2, which resonates with what Casorati did in 1890:
square the curvatures. This becomes clear when we expand the Willmore
conditions:

Having arithmetic and geometric means, another natural question is whether we
can apply the graphical methods described earlier to determine AM and GM
(indirectly via HM), using k1 and k2. The Harmonic Mean has been used recently in
the concept of amalgamatic curvatures. Since we are dealing now with the squares
(directly in AM with the Casorati curvature, with positive curvatures only in GM),
we are in need of a different spacing, a quadratic one. In order to align this we need
to map a parabola onto a line. This can be achieved by using parabolic trigono-
metric functions.
So in many ways we ﬁnd inevitable relations between curvatures that funda-
mentally relate to the intrinsic nature of these shapes, and curvatures that funda-
mentally relate to the shape, which these shapes assume in their ambient world, i.e.
extrinsic curvatures. A main goal of differential geometry is to describe and
understand the shape of surfaces (and generalizations of shape to manifolds). We
then study these shapes in Euclidean space (or generalization), as submanifold in a
Euclidean space. Minimal surfaces for example are submanifolds realizing the
equality K ¼ H2 ¼ 0.
In general terms, a submanifold is said to be an ideal submanifold in some space
when it actually realizes at all of its points the equality in such generally holding
inequality. Inequalities give a dynamic character. Submanifolds have intrinsic
structures, which normally do not change. Ideal submanifolds thus experience the
least possible external curvature that might be imposed on them by the form they
assume in a given surrounding world. This is akin to experiencing the least possible
stress that the living conditions in these ambient spaces may impose on the sub-
manifolds, the creatures, which happen to live in these worlds. An ideal subman-
ifold is then ideally embedded [196]. The most well known example is the spherical
shapes of soap bubbles, but also space-time models of the FLRW-type have been
shown to be ideally embedded.
Similarly, plant shapes in morphology and anatomy, crystals and snowﬂakes,
also strive for the status of ideal submanifold, adapted to the surrounding space in a
best possible way, in a certain type of equilibrium, irrespective of development
times or materials. One will not fail to see the inevitable connection to the natural
world in evolution, and how the intrinsic qualities of shapes, represented by either
or both biological or mathematical DNA, necessarily have to relate to and interact
with the world-around. All creatures, great and small, animate or inanimate, have to
cope with a range of challenges in different ways. Coping with the “environment”
successfully means nothing more or less than trying to ﬁnd a best way of living in a

best world, since both the ﬁt creature, and the world around, play their part in this
interactive and inevitable co-existence and co-evolution. This may involve various
contributions from the extrinsic and intrinsic curvatures, as arithmetic mean, or
weighted arithmetic mean.
Constant Mean Curvature Surfaces and Conic Sections
How to measure the stress on a surface in its environment? Via mean curvature H.
The Laplacian is directly related to the mean curvature H on surfaces. For surfaces
in n dimensions it is, according to a theorem of Beltrami:
Dx ¼ nH
ð9:8Þ
In this way the stress on a surface can be conceptualized using the principal
curvatures of the surfaces k1 and k2, in particular their arithmetic mean H. This is a
nearly universal principle in physics, and biology as well. Minimizing H or H2 is
one way to strive for equality in the classical inequality K  H2, between the
intrinsic or Gaussian curvature K and the square of the mean curvature H. It is a
geometric version of the classical inequality
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
GM
p
 AM. There are a number of
options. The stress on the surface is distributed as evenly as possible and can be
zero or larger than zero. There are two general cases in which H ¼ 0: the plane and
the catenoid. The latter is the shape obtained when two rings are pulled out of a
soap solution. The proﬁle curve between the rings is a catenary, and revolving this
around a central axis, yields the catenoid. In both plane and catenoid, the inequality
becomes an equality in the sense that K ¼ H ¼ 0. In soap bubbles spheres are the
perfect shape for a free-ﬂoating solution, minimizing (differences in) surface ten-
sion, but the mean curvature is not constant.
There are three other cases, in which H 6¼ 0, but distributed as evenly as pos-
sible. This is the case in the cylinder, the unduloid and the nodoid. All these
surfaces are generated from proﬁle curves revolved around a central axis. All such
shapes are known as constant mean curvature CMC surfaces, or Delaunay surfaces.
The rotational surfaces of Delaunay, i.e. those of constant mean curvature H,
(planes and catenoids for H = 0, spheres and circular cylinders and unduloids and
nodoids for H 6¼ 0) are of very special interest, since their proﬁle curves or roul-
ettes, are obtained by rolling conic sections over a plane (Table 9.1). When the
curves obtained by rolling a circle, ellipse, parabola and hyperbola are rotated
around the base line, they indeed give rise to cylinders, unduloids, catenoids and
nodoids respectively, another of Geometry’s Fantastic Gems. Delaunay shapes
effectively occur in various living organisms, feeling at home in the sea. Once more
conic sections, based on the application of areas of the Pythagoreans, and physically
exempliﬁed by light bundles through a pinhole, are involved. The studies of
152

minimal surfaces, known as Plateau’s Problem, have occupied the minds of the
brightest mathematicians and physicists in the past two centuries.
Miyuki Koiso and Bennett Palmer have deﬁned Constant Mean Anisotropic
Curvature CAMC surfaces, [13, 197, 198] i.e. anisotropic analogues of catenoids
and Delaunay surfaces (Fig. 9.3). According to Bennett Palmer:
The nearly universal principle in the natural sciences is that the equilibrium conﬁguration of
a system can be found by minimizing its total energy among all admissible conﬁgurations.
When we are considering the surface interface between two or more immiscible materials,
the surface geometry is determined by minimizing the surface tension subject to whatever
additional constraints are imposed by the environment. These constraints may take the form
of boundary conditions or may include constraints that the volume or even the surface area
be preserved under deformations. In addition, there may be additional energy contributions
depending on the boundary such as wetting and line tension. There may also be energy
contributions arising from external forces such as gravity. For materials, which are in an
ordered phase, the interfacial energy may be anisotropic, i.e. its density may depend on the
direction of the surface. This is particularly true of the surface if a crystal, a fact that is
empirically obvious from the way that the surface geometry tends to favor certain direc-
tions. There is a canonical equilibrium surface, called the Wulff shape that can be char-
acterized as the absolute minimizer of the free energy F among all surfaces enclosing the
same three dimensional volume as the Wulff shape.
A Wulff shape is the “sphere” for an anisotropic energy in the sense that it is the
minimizer of the energy for a ﬁxed volume. More generally, from a technical point
of view, any of the three dimensional shapes deﬁned by Eq. 5.17 or similar is a Wulff
shape which means that the shapes are minimizers for a certain anisotropic energy
functional. This gives rise to supercatenoids, superunduloids and supernodoids. The
examples that they used for Wulff shapes are Lamé surfaces or supershapes. It will
come as no surprise that such shapes also occur in nature.
The supercatenoid has the property that sufﬁciently small pieces of it minimize
the anisotropic energy deﬁned by the Wulff shape among all surfaces having the
same boundary. Sufﬁciently small pieces of the unduloid and nodoid minimize the
anisotropic energy among all surfaces having the same boundary and enclosing the
same three-dimensional volume (Fig. 9.3).
This anisotropic view provides a geometrical foundation for the development of
natural shapes, with a direct relation to soap ﬁlms, minimal surfaces and surfaces of
constant mean curvature, but extended to CAMC for anisotropic energies. Research
of supershapes with the remarkable correspondence to natural shapes will
increasingly become the study of the way they are solutions to optimization
problems through their properties, curvatures (the mathematical DNA of shapes)
and related invariants.

Curvature Deﬁned by Lamé and Gielis Curves
This extension to the anisotropic case is an important step in addressing René
Thom’s challenge, namely “to construct an abstract, purely geometrical theory of
morphogenesis, independent of the substrate of forms and the nature of the forces
that create them”. The descriptive part are curves and surfaces and the shapes which
are derived via Gielis-transformations (of the conic sections), which describe and
determine in a uniform and universal way an enormous diversity of natural shapes.
Conic sections are at the core, once more.
Returning to conic sections, we know that Lamé curves have conic sections as
special case. The question then is whether we can generalize the notion of curvature
in a geometrical way, based on our uniform description. The deﬁnition of curvature
is essentially a local operation. In each point of a curve a circle can be ﬁtted and its
radius is the inverse of the curvature. If however, one desires to describe the
curvature of a square, then in each point of the ﬂat sides with zero curvature,
(intuitively) a circle with inﬁnitely large radius needs to be applied; except in the
vertices, where the curvature is inﬁnitely large, and an inﬁnitely small circle needs
to be applied. The straightforward question, with the knowledge we have on Lamé
curves, is then, whether it would not make more sense to deﬁne the curvature of a
square on the basis of the osculating square itself, i.e. the corresponding Lamé
curve. The square is a unit circle anyway, and one could choose the inscribed
square for convenience and ease, avoiding limits and inﬁnity. In a similar way the
curvatures of starﬁsh, pentagons and pentagrams are deﬁned by the corresponding
osculating supershapes.
We have to think intrinsically. After all, we think that vectors stretch whereas
they might not stretch at all for internal observers. If we rotate the osculating
starﬁsh a few degrees, it will no longer be osculating globally (Fig. 9.4 left). This
however is a strictly Euclidean view. The correct way to rotate the osculating circle
is to follow the distance measures and symmetry dictated by the space, so that it
will shorten and lengthen according to the angle (but we have this shortening and
lengthening under full control). The osculating unit circle is precisely the shape

(Fig. 9.4 center). This is easily understood if we consider a chain of beads on the
curve: when the string of beads moves on the starﬁsh curve, they will nicely follow
it (just like a string of beads on a circle will follow the circle). The shortest path
along the curve is the curve itself (Fig. 9.4 right). The triviality is that the shortest
perimeter to enclose the curve is simply to follow the curve itself.
Like in the case of the circle that has precisely one osculating circle, curvature
then becomes a global operation, at once describing the curvature of the complete
shape, in full precision. In 3D the same procedure could be applied.

Curvature Deﬁned by Lamé and Gielis Curves

This allows us to study curvature of lines, polygons and irregular curves, in a
piecewise way. Rather than a purely global or local operation, one could also
consider a glocal operation, whereby to certain sections of shapes (arcs of a curve) a
Lamé curve or supershape could be applied.
The Inverse Square Law Generalized
The curvature of a curve is the inverse of the radius of the osculating circle to the
curve in a point j ¼ 1
R, and this radius lies on the same line as the normal vector.
From this many inverse square laws in physics are derived, deﬁned by
1
R2. In
general, the intensity of a signal from a point source decreases with distance as the
square of the distance to the source. This is the case in light, radiation and sound,
electrical charges (Coulomb’s law) and gravitational attraction between two masses.
One can rewrite these laws for masses and charge, respectively as:
F
G ¼ m1m2

and
4pe0:F ¼ q1q2

So we ﬁnd that the deﬁnition of curvature (and consequences like the inverse
square law) comes for free with the description of the shape in a generalized
Pythagorean way.
Sectional Curvature of Riemannian Manifolds
Thus far we dwelled in two and three dimensions (or four, taking into account the
two perpendicular planes with different axes). Generalizations to higher dimensions
are possible, but we will limit to one result related to curvature.
The Theorema egregium of Gauss (1826) asserted that Gaussian curvature of
surfaces is invariant under isometric deformations of surfaces M2 in E3. It is the
intrinsic characteristic par excellence and this theorem yielded the distinction
between intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures. Riemann generalized this for higher
dimensions and this led to the creation of Riemannian geometry, which became the
core of modern differential geometry. Riemannian spaces are characterized by their
curvatures and all curvature information is contained in the Riemann curvature
tensor R. This means that the knowledge of curvature is the same as that of all
sectional curvatures. Riemann showed that the sectional curvature is directly related
to the Gaussian curvature, so that such sectional curvatures can be deﬁned in the
very classical Oresme-Newton tradition when embedded in a Euclidean space.
Earlier we referred to the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures on surfaces, the ﬁrst,
Gaussian curvature, deﬁned by the product of the two principal curvatures (the
square of the geometric mean) and the second the mean curvature H, deﬁned as the
arithmetic mean of the two principal curvatures. The inequality K  H2 then plays a
key role in the shape that natural organisms, living or not, attain in a given envi-
ronment, striving for equality in the inequality, as is the case for planes and cate-
noids [12]. Such relationships can be generalized to higher dimensions, in which a
surface becomes an n-dimensional manifold, which can be embedded in a n þ m
dimensional Euclidean space. The notion of n-dimensional manifold introduced by
Bernhard Riemann, generalized the insight of Gauss on the curvature of surfaces.
And it turned out that the same principles that apply for curves and surfaces, can be
generalized for any dimension.
The Inverse Square Law Generalized

Theorem 9.5 [199]: The sectional curvature KðPÞ of any submanifold Mn of a
Euclidean space Em þ n, for any tangent plane section P at any of its points p,
equals the Gauss curvature at p of the corresponding 2-dimensional normal section
P 2
p ofMn in Em þ n:
Theorem 9.6 [199]: Any sectional curvature of a submanifold Mn in Em þ n is
determined by the curvatures of at most two associated Euclidean planar curves.
In this way the Oresme-Newton tradition comes full circle for any m-dimen-
sional manifold in a n þ m dimensional space. Moreover, Theorem 9.6 can be
reduced to the curvature of one associated Euclidean planar curve. From this we
have the following:
Scholium 9.7 The curvature of this Euclidean curve can be determined in the
classical way, using osculating circles, or by a Gielis transformation on the
Euclidean circle.
Scholium 9.8 It is then possible to develop a geometry based on the notion of
curvature, with osculating supershapes.
Curvature Diagrams
There is a graphical way of visualizing curvatures and their relations, via a plane
graph with X ¼ k1 ¼ j1 and Y ¼ k2 ¼ j2, with j1; j2 the principal curvatures.
Since k1  k2 we need to consider only a halfplane. Within this halfplane the
conditions k1 ¼ k2, k1 þ k2 ¼ RH, k1 : k2 ¼ RK, k2
1 þ k2
2 ¼ RC, with RH; RK, RC
constants, are readily visualized as straight lines (constant mean curvature H),
hyperbola (constant Gaussian curvature K) and circle (constant Casorati curvature),
respectively. It is then easy to see, for given values of k1; k2 what various conditions
on curvatures mean [200].
The curvature ellipse related to Euler’s theorem describing the normal curvatures
jN also ﬁts here. Thinking back of the parabola and the application of squares and
rectangles, a constant product K ¼ k1:k2 (the intrinsic quality of a surface) remains
constant if the original rectangle with sides k1; k2 and area A ¼ k1:k2, is turned into
some other rectangle (along the hyperbola, for example with sides 3k1 and 1
3 k2Þ or
square (with sides
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
k1:k2
p
Þ with the same area. In other words, for the intrinsic
quality K ¼ k1:k2 to remain constant, we can ﬁnd different realisations with dif-
ferent k1; k2, as long as they scale in such a way to keep their product constant. We
can do this not only for 2D surfaces, but also for manifolds Mn in Em þ n since the
sectional curvatures are directly given by the Gaussian curvatures of the 2D normal
sections.
One could easily generalize the relation between the principal curvatures to
Lamé curves kn

L. The Casorati curvature, as a circle, is then C ¼ 1

and the mean curvature H ¼ 1

: Note that with constant Lamé curvature we
operate directly via the principal curvatures, which is different from jL deﬁned
earlier on the basis of oscullating Lamé curves. We are free to apply Gielis
transformations on these graphs (Fig. 9.5).
Flowers as Analytical Method for Studying Curvature
A further advantage compared to local operations with circles, is that this glocal or
global curvature can be expanded in a ﬁnite polynomial. One of the main tools in
differential geometry and analysis is the expansion in Taylor series, due to Newton
and by deﬁnition inﬁnite, but we have a tool for ﬁnite expansions available in the
form of Chebyshev polynomials. This may be understood when we consider
superparabola’s of the type y ¼ xn
j
j: These can also be used as measures of cur-
vature, in a local (pointwise) or glocal (section of a curve) operation, or even the
global operation if the curve under study is y ¼ xn

In the tradition of Oresme of deﬁning curvature by using a circle, the
Pythagorean Theorem provided the compact expression of the curvature. Newton
built upon this and determined the curvature of a curve analytically by inﬁnite
series, still essentially a local operation. Using transcendental functions—trigono-
metric ones—Fourier succeeded in a global description of a curve, in terms of
inﬁnite series, Fourier series. Now we use the compact (Pythagorean style)
expression of a supershape or Lamé curve to deﬁne curvature, as well as a ﬁnite
expression using Chebyshev polynomials. Obviously this coincides with Fourier
cosine series, since the correspondence with Chebyshev polynomials is complete.
In this way we combine the classical views of Oresme-Newton-Fourier (and in fact
Ptolemy) into a more general notion of curvature beyond a local operation only.
In the beautiful landscapes and universes of geometry, one might easily get lost,
but shortcuts can always be found. Euler’s Theorem on the curvature in a point on a
surface, written in terms of principal curvatures, can be rewritten as follows [201]:

respectively, so that also classical curvatures can be expressed directly as
Chebyshev polynomials. Our generalized curvatures can then be expressed in this
very same way. It started with a letter to Leibniz, and transformed into compact and
powerful tools.
Circles and Spirals
Dealing with anisotropic shapes, we must take into account that what looks ani-
sotropic to us, may well be isotropic for the shape itself. The example of the string
of beads rotating round a supershape clariﬁed this. In this case, intrinsic curvatures
160
9
Natural Curvature Conditions

based on supershapes, are proposed. However, because of the compact structure
and the trigonometric functions, we can relate it immediately to classical notions
based on the circle. In traditional geometry, the geometry developed using our
intuition of space, circle and straight line are the main tools, also in curved spaces,
where differential geometry strives towards studying curvatures with Euclidean
geometry, as much as possible. Now, we will show in a purely geometrical way
how, in the study of natural sciences, most elementary shapes can be reduced to two
basic shapes, the circle and the spiral. Applying Gielis Transformations to these two
basic shapes then become strategic tools in the study of natural shapes and
phenomena.
The ubiquity of circle and spiral as basic shapes or movements are not new.
Goethe lived and worked in the same period as Gauss, also a student of nature, but
in a different way. At the end of the 20th century, Goethe’s “Alles ist Blatt” ideas
were corroborated in the ﬁeld of plant molecular biology. All manifold realizations
of the concept Leaf are in principle variations on a theme, and a chain of molecular
events, dependent on timing and position, is set in motion to produce vegetative
leaves, bracts, spines, tendrils, or any of the ﬂower organs, sepals, petals, pistils and
stamen. For Goethe growth was expansion and contraction: growing stems and
branches make the plant expand, and in the generative phase, everything is con-
tracted, into very compact structures, governed by intrinsic parameters (internal
clocks, cells, organs, DNA, biochemistry and physiology), in a synchronous dance
with the environment (seasons, gravitation, light and nutrients…).
Towards the end of his life, around 1729–1831, Goethe, was particularly
inspired by the spiral and its development. In Über die Spiraltendenz der
Vegetation, he describes observations of many spiral tendencies in nature, in
growing stems, ﬂowers, inﬂorescences [202]. Of course, Goethe was not the ﬁrst to
refer to this and he cites and compares many published works on this matter. This
spiral tendency would later become one of Charles Darwin’s main interests. It is not
widely known that Darwin gathered a lot of empirical evidence on plants (more
than on Galapagos ﬁnches in any case). Among his main interests was the behavior
of climbers (with spiral or helical tendencies) and rapid movements in plants.
So now there are two main tendencies: the upright growth and branching on the
one hand, and the spiral growth of phyllotaxy and the structure within the ﬂower
(either spiral or whorled conﬁgurations) on the other. We can characterize both
tendencies geometrically; the vertical tendency with the circle as basic ﬁgure, and
aligning with the earth’s gravitational ﬁeld, versus the constant ratio with the
development of leaves and organs from a spiral sequence on a conical meristematic
dome (Fig. 9.6).
Circles and Spirals

Going with and Going Against the Flow
In the classical approach with the Serret-Frenet-Pagani frame we study the double
curvature (curvature and torsion) along the path with the tangent. But since we start
from a center, we also have the availability of a position vector from a central point.
In this case, we can study the relation between the tangent space and the position
vector. For a curve given by X #
ð Þ ¼ ðqðcos #Þ; qðsin #ÞÞ, the second derivative
X
00 #
ð Þ describes the tension in the curve [165].
Now there are two possible opposites. Either position vector and tension vector
are parallel
X k X00
ð
Þ, or they are orthogonal
X?X
00


. The parallel case X k X
00
occurs when the vector product of both vectors is zero. Then the basic ﬁgure is the
circle. If the scalar product is zero we have the orthogonal case: X?X
00 , X:X
00 ¼
0: The basic ﬁgure is then the spiral (logarithmic spiral). So we have the two basic
ﬁgures in nature in one coherent picture. The beauty is that both circle and spirals
occur in ﬂowers and ﬂower development, so this is a perfect area of study (Fig. 9.6).
In this relation between X and X
00, the tension in the curve can be aligned in two
opposite ways. In the parallel case with circle as a basic ﬁgure the dynamic can be
understood as going with the ﬂow, and in the case of the spiral, the dynamic is to
completely oppose the ﬂow.
D’Arcy Thompson gave a beautiful description of how growth opposing the
ﬂow works:
In mechanical structures, curvature is essentially a mechanical phenomenon. It is found in
ﬂexible structures as a result of bending, or it may be introduced into construction for the
purpose of resisting such a bending-moment. But neither shell nor tooth nor claw are
ﬂexible structures; they have not been bent into their peculiar curvature, they have grown
into it.
We may for a moment, however, regard the equiangular or logarithmic spiral of our shell
from the dynamic point of view, by looking at growth itself as the force concerned. In the
growing structure, let growth at a point P be resolved into a force F acting along the line

joining P to a pole O, and a force T acting in a direction perpendicular to OP; and let G be
the magnitude of these forces (or of these rates of growth) remain constant. It follows that
the resultant of the forces F and T (as PQ) makes a constant angle with the radius vector.
But a constant angle between tangent and radius vector is a fundamental property of the
“equiangular” spiral: the very property with which Descartes started his investigation, and
that which gives its alternative name to the curve (Fig. 9.7).
In such a spiral, radial growth and growth in the direction of the curve bear a constant
ratio to one another. For, if we consider a consecutive radius vector OP′, whose increment
as compared with OP is dr, while ds is the small arc PP′, then dr/ds = cos a = constant. In
the growth of a shell, we can conceive no simpler law than this, that it shall widen and
lengthen in the same unvarying proportions: and this simplest of laws is that which Nature
tends to follow. The shell, like the creature within it, grows in size but does not change its
shape; and the existence of this constant relativity of growth, or constant similarity of form,
is of the essence, and may be made the basis of a deﬁnition, of the equiangular spiral.
The position vector (also known as radius vector or location vector) is central in
geometry [203]. It is the most elementary and natural geometric object giving the
position relative to a reference point. This coincides completely with developments
in contemporary differential geometry. The constant ratio spiral is the 2D version of
constant ratio submanifolds of Bang-yen Chen in n-dimensions, with a constant
ratio between the tangent and the normal direction on a submanifold. D’Arcy
Thompson’s Law of Growth, as it has been baptized by geometers [165], is a special
case. This constant ratio is very important in natural shapes. Both circle and spiral
are examples of constant ratio curves. For a circle this is obvious: the tangent and

163

the normal are perpendicular going around the curve. For the spiral, growth is from
a central point, and occurs at the end of the curve. The logarithmic spiral as we
know, is characterized precisely by having a constant ratio between these two as
well, namely between the resolvents of growth in length and width.
It also underlines the value of D’Arcy Thompsons magniﬁcent book On Growth
and Form. In this book he summarized much of the knowledge in geometry and
how it could be applied to natural shapes. In 1917, half a century had elapsed since
Darwin’s Theory of Evolution was published, and around the turn of the century,
Hugo DeVries had rediscovered Mendel’s experiments. Feeling that this would lead
to a strong divergence between physics and biology, D’Arcy Thompson wanted to
emphasize the role of physical laws, mechanics and mathematics. In On Growth
and Form, logarithmic spirals, allometric laws, constant mean curvature surfaces in
marine organisms and much more, apply ﬁndings of Laplace, Delaunay and many
other great mathematicians, to biology.
D’Arcy Thompson wanted to go against the trend of biology overemphasizing
evolution as fundamental determinant in shapes. In this sense he applied his own
law going against the ﬂow. For him everything in nature, which can be studied, is
subject to mathematical and physical laws. Thompson wrote: “An organism is so
complex a thing, and growth so complex a phenomenon, that for growth to be so
uniform and constant in all the parts as to keep the whole shape unchanged would
indeed be an unlikely and an unusual circumstance. Rates vary, proportions
change, and the whole conﬁguration alters accordingly.” It is an illusion to think
that a molecule like DNA is the only or major determinant. As contemporary
molecular biology has understood, development is a very closely regulated inter-
play between internal (DNA, biochemisty, cells and organs) and external charac-
teristics (soil, weather, season), via epigenetic imprinting. This aligns with
contemporary developments in geometry, with circle and spiral as basic shapes.
DNA itself for example is a Generalized Möbius Listing body with torsion [116] (in
planar projected view a rational Gielis curve) with internal structure. The tension
imposed globally or locally onto the molecule can be modiﬁed by changing its
conformation locally or globally, transcription as one example. Transposable ele-
ments may play an important role comparable to tuning a violin or a piano.
A basic shape as the circle is the basis for many of the optimal curves that have
been studied throughout the ages. The spiral is associated directly to natural growth
and the exponential function and many other tendencies. For example, Newton
found that if the motion in a central force ﬁeld obeys an inverse-cube law, the mass
particle would spiral off into space, instead of revolving around in orbits deﬁned by
conic sections. The trajectory of a mass particle subject to a central force of
attraction located at the origin, which obeys the inverse-cube law, is a curve of
constant-ratio.

Applying Gielis Transformations to the Basic Shapes
Beyond circles and spirals, how do we deal with all types of anisotropies in nature?
Most mollusks are not Nautilus shells or snails, the prime example of spirals in
nature. With this analysis of constant ratio submanifolds, we can return to the
opening statement of this book: “The geometrical description of curves and sur-
faces, and the shapes that are derived via Gielis-transformations, describe and
determine in a uniform and universal way an enormous diversity of natural shapes”
[3]. Indeed, we can simply apply Gielis transformations to the basic forms that
naturally form in Euclidean geometry [165] (Fig. 9.8).
With Gielis transformations, we have a position vector with variable length, the
variation given by the superformula, and this can be applied to circle and spiral. We
already showed many examples of this. It is basically modifying the “curvature”
with Gielis transformations, so we go from circle to the generalized form:

Generalized is understood in the framework of Pythagorean compact descrip-
tion. The transformation is a “curvature” related parameter, deﬁning smaller or
larger circles or spirals with particular shapes. In the case of spirals this transfor-
mation can also be applied as substitute for the parameter k, opening many other
possibilities of studying natural phenomena. It is important to note that this can be
completely embedded in higher dimensions, both in deﬁnite and indeﬁnite setting,
within the framework of contemporary geometry. When studying natural shapes,
we will be able to recognize the major tendencies (circle or spiral, or constant ratio

in general), and the local deformations induced by the speciﬁc circumstances via the
curvatures. From a kinematic point of view, the movement traced out by the radius
or position vector can be decomposed in a basic shape (circle or spiral) and a Gielis
curve, in planar projection or as movements on (generalized) cylinders and cones or
on supershapes (Fig. 5.9).
Determinatio and Constructio
In the Determinatio and Constructio parts it was initially shown how Lamé and
Gielis curves are embedded in a long tradition of geometry and mathematics. They
can be extended in several ways, such as varying spacing of angles, or combina-
tions of shapes, while retaining their compact Pythagorean structure. Several
methods can be applied in the study of natural shapes, from the solution of
boundary value problems, to the geometric description of combined domains via
R-functions. Also Fourier’s method of separation of variables can now be applied to
many problems in mathematical physics and to any normal polar domain in 2D and
3D, which will make life much easier.
We showed how with the description of the domains, various characteristics
come for free, and how description itself can be used to deﬁne speciﬁc unit circles
and as a measure of curvature. This is not restricted to 2 or 3 dimensions only. With
the compact description a link was made to ﬁnite type polynomials, in particular
Chebyshev polynomials. At the same time these wonderful polynomials have been

Bamboo Leaves and Tree Rings
The plant has always appeared to us very remote, because its
life is so still and silent. In its apparent immobility and placidity
the plant stands in strong contrast to the energetic animal with
its reﬂex movements and pulsating organs. Yet the same
environment which, with its changing inﬂuences, so profoundly
affects the animal, is also playing upon the plant. Storm and
sunshine, the warmth of summer and the frost of winter,
drought and rain – all these and many more come together and
go about it. What about the subtle impressions they leave
behind? Internal changes there must be; but our eyes have not
the power to see them.

Shape Analysis with the Superformula
Our transformations are continuous and can capture a lot of variation in a few
numbers. Assigning ranges to these few numbers should allow the capture of
variation to some mathematically reasonable extent. These ranges can be deter-
mined from many repeated and reproducible measurements on real shapes. In this
chapter we will see how variation ﬁts well within the framework of generic and
geometric description. This will be shown for bamboo leaves and for tree rings in
various conifers or softwoods. Variation can be captured into a statistical distri-
bution, and from these statistics the parameter ranges can be extracted. It will also
be shown that for the study of nature, low parameter versions of our formula sufﬁce.
In fact, one parameter for dimension and one for shape are enough for describing
bamboo leaves for 46 species studied, and also for the study of variation of tree
rings.
Beyond the geometrical methods outlined in Determinatio and Constructio
chapters, methods and algorithms to reconstruct Gielis curves and surfaces from
data points and contours have been developed, both for 2D and 3D. These algo-
rithms can detect supershapes such as starﬁsh, quantifying the differences between
various starﬁsh. The algorithms can detect shapes with integer and non-integer

symmetries, without prior knowledge, or training. It is important to note that the
detection of rotational symmetries of real and incomplete objects without prior
information is still a challenging and open problem. Furthermore, since symmetries
are not differentiable parameters, they cannot be retrieved using deterministic
methods, which imposes additional pre-processing and symmetry extractions before
shape recovery [204, 205]. This problem has been solved, and the algorithms even
allow the analysis of self-intersecting curves, which can be found for example in all
projections in the plane of curves wound on helices or conics or shapes based on
spherical products with self-intersecting cross sections. To our knowledge these are
the ﬁrst algorithms that can ﬁnd self-intersecting curves, in the plane or in space.
They are robust as well, against outliers or incomplete data [134].
The most efﬁcient techniques are based on combinations of stochastic and
deterministic methods. Evolutionary algorithms are used for a very limited number
of generations to rapidly determine broad solutions that are then reﬁned using
deterministic methods. In the ﬁrst step, the stochastic method provides one family
of solutions for the raw problem of determining the appropriate symmetry and
approximations of the shape coefﬁcients without any prior information. Through a
careful deﬁnition and construction of evolutionary operators coupled with a cost
function built upon the Euclidean distance, the algorithm very quickly eliminates
shapes with incorrect symmetries to only retain a population of few approximate
solutions. Because a major drawback of stochastic methods is their slow conver-
gence, the ﬁne-tuning of an optimal solution is obtained in the second step using the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm [134].
Consequently, this strategy allows for robust and efﬁcient shape initialization
with quick and accurate determination of a solution. By way of comparison: if only
stochastic methods were used for the analysis, this would require thousands of
generations for large populations, whereas now a few hundreds of generations for
much smaller populations sufﬁce. Oppositely, if only deterministic methods were
used, some of the slightest variations of the initial guess, for instance due to missing
data or incoherent pose estimation, might lead to local minima and/or numerical
instabilities. Stochastic approaches need not be restricted to evolutionary algo-
rithms, but other methods like particle swarm optimization PSO can be used to
determine the optimal parameters for the optimal shape. This can even be improved
by adding deterministic optimization in the ﬁnal stages. These methods can be
applied to abstract, man-made or natural shapes of highly complex nature.
However, in nature we ﬁnd numerous examples of much simpler cases in which
only a limited set of the 6 parameters of the Gielis formula is needed, and we will
provide detailed examples of bamboo leaves and tree rings.

Bamboo Leaves and Tree Rings

Plant Leaves
Fundamental features of plants are self-similarity and symmetry, and all plants are
in some sense repetitions of basic phytomers. Most plants, in particular monocots,
have a simple structure, a repetition of phytomers consisting of an internode and a
nodal zone. At the nodal zone a bud and protective leaf structures are implanted.
This basic structure has led to a great diversity of growth forms and to a variety of
plant models for plants, trees, grasses and bamboos, members of the grass sub-
family Bambusoideae.
Plant growth is the result of the timing and spatial organization of the devel-
opment of organs from a meristematic zone. In physiology various studies have
focused on timing and spatial aspects of gene expression, in relation to the for-
mation of organs. One example is the development of lateral outgrowth of organs
from apical meristems and the direct relation to the spatial distribution of auxin via
auxin transporters. However, gene action or gene regulatory networks do not give a
complete picture. In the development of such organs it is mathematical and physical
laws that are leading. It is no surprise that Fibonacci and Lucas series are found so
frequently in phyllotaxy, both in the positioning of leaves along the stem and in the
arrangement of parts in single and composite ﬂowers. Phyllotactic patterns (Fig. 3.9)
have also been linked to physical phenomena optimizing space utilization [206].
Such locally organized structures then develop into organs, into new phytomers
or into leaves, either vegetative leaves or as modiﬁed leaves into ﬂoral structures.
Vegetative leaves are the most important plant organs for photosynthesis, and their
size and shape of leaves (Fig. 10.1) have an important inﬂuence on the morpho-
genesis and development of plants. As many plant organs vary with time during
growing seasons, it is important to identify a simple but adequate mathematical
model for capturing morphological change in plants. This is not a trivial task in
plants. Besides the classic phenotypic differences related to ecological habitat, there
are the phenomena of heteroblasty and heterochrony [207]. Heteroblasty is the
phenomenon, whereby several types of leaves occur, depending on position, or age.
Fig. 10.1 A variety of plant leaves

171

Heterochrony on the other hand is the phenomenon whereby timing is crucial.
Differences in timing can lead to simple versus compound leaves and heterochrony
is at the basis for natural variation in Cardamine hirsuta, a close relative of
Arabidopsis, whereby differences in leaf shape were correlated to ﬂowering time.
Last but not least it has been shown to be very difﬁcult to deﬁne precise landmarks
in leaves for morphometry in plants. Leaves and leaﬂets in compound leaves have
in general relatively simple shapes, but leaves can be highly variable as in Papaya
and Vasconcellea [208].
46 Bamboo Species, 1000 Leaves, 1 Equation
It started all and continues with bamboo. The bamboos (Poaceae: Bambusoideae)
consist of about 1400 species of temperate and tropical woody bamboos and a tribe
of herbaceous bamboos. Unlike other grasses, bamboos are the only major lineage
within the family that have adapted to and diversiﬁed within the forest habitat.
Bamboo leaves consists of two major parts, a sheath part and a blade part, with a
characteristic ligule with oral setae and auricles as appendages. Cauline leaves have
a protective function in the development of young shoots and stems. The sheath part
is very stiff and the blade is reduced strongly. In contrast, foliage leaves have fully
developed leaf blades and the blades are connected to the sheath via a
pseudo-petiole. This is a structure unique to all bamboos and some large leaved
grasses. These foliage leaf blades are usually linear, lanceolate or oblong-
lanceolate, with the tip long acuminate, often scabrous and the side glabrous or
softly hairy. The leaf blade is generally thinner than the culm sheath blade and often
shows more marked dorsiventrality. The morphology and structure of leaves vary
among species, and can be used for species identiﬁcation [209] (Fig. 10.2).
In contrast to all other grasses (with the exception of some large leaved grasses)
the leaf blades of bamboo are connected to the sheath part by a pseudo-petiole,
typical of all bamboo foliage leaf blades, reﬂecting the evolutionary stability of this
solution. Indeed, bamboos are one of the very few groups in the grass family that
have evolved in forests, not in open areas, still with large sizes (up to 20 m for
temperate bamboos and up to 30 m for tropical bamboos). Hollow and ﬂexible
culms and branches, protected during development with very stiff culms or branch
sheaths on the one hand, and leaf blades that are connected through pseudo-petioles
allowing for torsion on the other, contribute to the evolutionary success of woody
and herbaceous bamboos.
Also the anatomy of bamboo leaves is very stable throughout the subfamily. It is
remarkable that the pseudopetiole, a specialized structure in all bamboos (and only
some grasses with larger leaves), has hardly been studied. The course of the vas-
cular bundle and the possible presence of pulvini should be investigated, since
pseudopetioles allow bamboos to adjust the orientation of the blades towards the
sun or to ease torsion caused by wind or snow loads.

A Two-Parameter Model
The Gielis formula was tested on 46 bamboo species from different genera
(Table 10.1). For each species, the length was measured as the distance from the
leaf bottom to the tip, for over 500 leaves. 30 leaves per species of (approximately)
equal length close to the species mean were then selected and scanned for extracting
the coordinates on the leaf boundary.

Bamboo Leaves and Tree Rings

The shape of all leaf bamboo species is described by the simpliﬁed Gielis
equation extremely well [209, 210]. The shape of bamboo leaves is encoded in two
parameters, one for shape n and one for size (Eq. 10.1; Fig. 10.3), and the predicted
leaf shape matched the observed leaf shape perfectly for bamboo leaves (Fig. 10.4).

The goodness of ﬁt demonstrated also provides convincing evidence of bilateral
symmetry in bamboo leaves, with all coefﬁcients of determination higher than
0.980; the regression line only trivially deviated from the straight line of y = x.
Fig. 10.4
The variation of size and shape-parameters for these 46 species is illustrated in
Figs. 10.5 and 10.6. Although there was signiﬁcant difference in the leaf-shape
parameter among species from different genera or from the same genus, the cal-
culated leaf-shape parameters for these 46 species range only from 0.02 to 0.1. The
lower values are for shapes of more linear-lanceolate type, with Pleioblastus chino,
Pleioblastus simonii f. heterophyllus, Pleioblastus gramineus f. monstrispiralis,
Chimonobambusa tumidissinoda and Phyllostachys edulis. Leaves described by the
higher values of the shape parameter n are slightly broader in shape, with Shibataea
chinensis, Indosasa shibaeatoides and Bambusa multiplex var. riviereorum. The
rest of the leaves fall broadly within the range n = 0.03–0.08. The leaf shape is only
slightly variable in Indocalamus species.
Modelling with the modiﬁed Gielis equation with reduced number of parameters
is clearly applicable to a wide variety of temperate bamboo genera and species, with
lanceolate leaves. The range of shapes and sizes, from the small leaves of Bambusa
multiplex var. riviereorum to large leaves of Indocalamus victorialis, and from the
linear-lanceolate leaves of P. linearis to the broader leaves of Shibataea, can efﬁ-
ciently be modeled with one equation, with only two parameters.

The length of all leaves of these bamboo species follows the Weibull distribu-
tion, rather than the normal distribution. This distribution originates from the study
of different particle sizes in crushed particles, sand or volcanic ash, or failure rates
in products, following power laws. This implies that the distribution of leaf length
in bamboo follows a power law. Although the leaf sizes (length and width) of the
46 bamboo species of the study differ considerably, their leaf shapes vary relatively
little, but the difference can be clearly identiﬁed. The shape of bamboo leaf blades,
connected to a pseudopetiole, is a very efﬁcient solution in evolutionary sense. This
solution of a large leaf connected via a pseudopetiole, with leaf blades of varying
size to have both protective and light harvesting functionality, has been used in
(almost) every bamboo, both on macroscopic and anatomical level [211].
Whereas in the past bamboo leaf blades were characterized by the quantitative
measures of length and width with additional qualitative characteristic such as
linear-lanceolate or oblong-lanceolate, we now have a clear quantitative number for
a qualitative characteristic. Besides the use in identiﬁcation of species, this can also
be employed as a very precise method in ecology, taxonomy and studies of genetic
diversity of bamboo, avoiding the use of molecular markers. Only two parameters
are involved, one for length and one for shape, accounting for full variations in
shape and dimensions compared to 3 dimensional and 3 shape parameters for
grasses [209].

Bamboo Leaves and Tree Rings

Superelliptical Tree Rings and Bamboo Stems
and Rhizomes
Gielis transformations were used to study tree rings of ten different conifers or
softwoods. In general, cross sections of trees hint at circular shape of tree rings.
Tree rings that are more square or deviate otherwise from circles are found in
sections of square stems or branches (as is the case in teak branches and young
stems of teak), or sections close to roots (e.g. square oak, anchoring with four roots)
or higher up the stem in trees with butt roots (Fig. 10.7).
It was shown in [212] that tree rings are much better modeled by superellipses
(Fig. 10.8). The modiﬁed version of the Gielis formula used is with all exponents
n equal, which are Lamé curves, and with a and b, which starts from superellipses
(Eq. 10.2). Measuring hundreds of tree rings proved that the model was very
efﬁcient.

In this study this model was compared to a classical model of tree rings regarded
as circles using the Aikake Information Criterion. This is one statistical method,
which is a trade-off between the model’s success in ﬁtting the data and the com-
plexity of the model; it gives a relative measure of how efﬁcient and simple a model
is. If two models have the same success in data ﬁtting, the better one in the AIC
sense is the one with fewer parameters. A model with two parameters for describing

bamboo leaves in two parameters is preferred to a static model of grass leaves with
six parameters.
Both in bamboo leaves and tree rings there are excellent agreements between
model and real measured data, but in both cases two parameters sufﬁce. So deﬁ-
nitely from the AIC point of view the model is preferred to other multiparameter
models in the case of grass leaves, or to circular tree rings. In the latter case the AIC
of circle and superellipse are only the same when the tree ring is really circular. In
the case of the superellipses, the AIC remains low and stable across a range of
exponent n (from 0.75 to about 3) using simpliﬁed versions (Lamé type) [212].

Bamboo Leaves and Tree Rings

The study of tree rings permits a quantiﬁcation of the rotation of tree rings over
the years, and it is one of the very ﬁrst in its kind to focus on this aspect of growth
in trees. In softwoods it is well known that the stems of softwoods tend to spiral,
and may change direction after some time.
This rotation around the vertical axis is also torsion, relative to the axis as a
cylinder, and it has both genetic and environmental components. It is one combi-
nation of vertical and spiral tendencies, a ﬁeld of study, which inspired not only
Goethe’s Über die Spiraltendenz der Vegetation (1831) and Darwin’s On the
movement of climbing plants (1875) [213], but also Walter Liese’s detailed
Anatomische Untersuchungen an extrem drehwüchsigem Kiefernholz [214]. There
is a lot to be discovered and understood in this exciting ﬁeld of research in plants
and wood, where we combine our new geometrical methods with the excellent
work of excellent predecessors (Fig. 10.9).
A recent study by the Nanjing group on bamboo shoots and rhizomes used our
equation to study the shape of culms and pith cavities in various bamboo species
[215]. Stems, shape of shoot apical meristems and the spirality in certain bamboos
(e.g. monstrispiralis) can efﬁciently be modeled. The original idea of using Lamé
curves to study square bamboos, Chimonobambusa quadrangularis (number 2 in the
series in Fig. 10.10) has extended to modeling all bamboos, stems, rhizomes,
meristems, tissues…. In Fig. 10.10 numbers from 1 to 8 represent eight bamboo
species, respectively: Phyllostachys bissetii, Chimonobambusa quadrangularis,
Phyllostachys makinoi, Phyllostachys edulis, Bambusa polymorpha, Dendrocalamus
barbatus ‘internodiradicatus’, Dendrocalamus latiﬂorus and Dendrocalamus sini-
cus. Both wall and pith rings of all species can be very efﬁciently modeled with our
transformations, and this works for sections along stems and rhizomes, including the
spirality as in Pleioblastus Monstrispiralis, for cross sections of meristems as well, as
shown in [215].

Stems, Petioles and Cells
With our transformations we can initiate the geometrical study of these tendencies
in nature. Having one formula permits for the exact calculation of associated
characteristics such as perimeter, area and polar moment of inertia, with a deﬁnite
advantage over classical approaches using engineering formula. This provides a
direct advantage for biologists dealing with variable shapes and biomimicry. The
associated characteristics come for free with the description and actual shapes result
from solutions to classical boundary value problems.
In a study on the structural morphology of petioles of Philodendron melinonii
(Fig. 10.11) and the various layers of different tissues the shape of the petiole was
modelled with the Gielis formula [216]. Previously researchers had to resort to
speciﬁc formulas from engineering, for beams with well-deﬁned cross sections
(elliptic, square, circular, T or I beams…). Now shapes can be studied with well
deﬁned formulas over a continuous change of cross-sectional geometry along its
length and layer thickness, and to model different layers with different mechanical
characteristics. This allowed for gaining insight into the efﬁciency of biological
beams described by different tissues properties, geometry and turgidity, with
Philodendron and rhubarb petioles as object of study, combining theory and
measurements [216, 217]. The sections of petioles were scanned and analysed using
the full six parameters set of the Gielis transformations (Fig. 10.12).
In the same spirit one can efﬁciently analyse square stems or columnar cacti,
using subsequent cross sections at different heights. In the genus Chimonobambusa
Fig. 10.10 Observed culm wall rings and pith cavity rings (black solid lines) and the predicted
rings (red solid lines) of eight bamboo species show excellent correspondence [215]. Copyright

for example, Ch. quadrangularis is square-like along its complete stems, but other
species of the genus have square stems only in the lower zones of the stems. Also
cross sections of underground stems of Moso bamboo have been modelled in this
way. The model is also dynamic: the volume and size and shape of cross sections
(area and perimeter) of cacti changes depending on how much water is stored in the
cactus: it will expand after rainfall, shrink in drier periods
Many plants have square stems. In Inventing the Circle, the example was given
of a square stem with the same base radius as a circle. Growing the Lamé super-
circle from exponent n ¼ 2 to n ¼ 5 resulted in extra area in the corners of about
21%, but the polar moment of inertia increased by more than 50%. A small
investment in extra area and material then results in extra strength. The area/polar
moment of inertia ratio is but one example, and focused only on homogeneous
materials, but plants are smart: they invest in extra strong materials and tissues in
these corners and the weakest tissues in the centre (or even no materials at all-in
hollow stems) for the same geometrical reason: the tissues farthest away from the
central axis have the most prominent role in resistance against torsion and bending
[1, 215, 216, 218].
Having these characteristics available immediately allows to study such ratios in
more depth. Ratio’s as area/perimeter, area/polar moment of inertia etc. can be used.
One can compare this to the mathematical geometrical question of the isoperimetric
inequality: what shape has the largest area for a given perimeter? We know since
Antiquity that this is the circle, but if one asked what is the best shape for the optimal
ratio of area/perimeter, circle and square both win, with ratio equal to 2 for both. With
other constraints, we will ﬁnd supershapes with exponents different from 2 or 1 to be
the better solutions [218, 219]. These methods blend in seamlessly with current
methods used in plant biology, biomechanics [220] and biophysics [221] (Fig. 10.13).
Instead of studying cross sections along a stem or petiole, we can use the very
same methods to understand positioning of shapes in a plane, on a curved surface
or in space. Similar optimisation principles are at work in tissues. Cells in plants
are stacked in ways to optimize the internal volume, minimize the intercellular
space and maximize the area of exchange between cells, while ensuring strength.
Wood is one example, but Nature has provided many, many examples of beautiful

multi-optimization problems, based on purely geometrical strategies. Improved
modeling accuracy will have profound effects on estimating biomass, deriving more
accurate allometric laws and so much more (Fig. 10.14).
The many applications of our transformations in technology, e.g. nanotechnol-
ogy, optics, antenna and wireless communications [222, 223] could lead to a better
understanding of nature. Alternatively, natural shapes could serves as an endless
source of inspiration for the development of technology, e.g. Ginkgo leaves for
wearable antennas [224]. We now study these problems based on one single uni-
fying transformation, indifferent of the scale or the nature of the problem (inde-
pendent of the forces that create them). The exact mechanisms underlying this
optimization in nature can be of physical, chemical or biochemical nature. To adjust
to the environment in an optimal way organisms and natural objects can draw on
chemistry, genes, from the existing toolbox. One thing is certain: the systems we
study are structurally stable. The kosmos becomes more cosmos or ordened, rather
than chaos and chaotic.

Snowﬂakes and Asclepiads
There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers,
having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one;
and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the
ﬁxed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms
most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being,
evolved.
Charles Darwin
Soap Bubbles, Culcita Novaeguineae and Ammonoids
One of the most beautiful stories in botany is that of the Orchid Angraecum ses-
quipedale. It has very long nectar trails and Charles Darwin inferred the existence
of a certain species of pollinator, having long tongues [225]. Alfred Wallace pro-
vided guidance towards the discovery of this moth [226]. 50 years later such animal
was discovered and it was aptly called praedicta as its existence had indeed been
predicted. If one looks at the spherical shape of a free ﬂoating soap bubble, the
sphere seems to be the best shape to minimize tension. Soap molecules can organize
themselves in all directions to achieve this. In crystals, ﬂowers and starﬁsh, how-
ever, there are preferred directions; not all parts can move freely in the same
direction to achieve the shape of a sphere. On the contrary: in nature we see square
stems and starﬁsh as optimized solutions, following millions of years of adaptation
to natural conditions and environments. Square stems represent optimization of
fourfold symmetry, starﬁsh of ﬁve fold symmetry with a lot of variation on these
basic themes.
A natural question is then: if we have soap ﬁlms on the one hand and starﬁsh on
the other, nature should have experimented with intermediate solutions as well,
shapes somewhere halfway between sphere and starﬁsh shape. If one asks the
question, the answer is already given: searching through collections of starﬁsh, I
soon came across Culcita novaeguineae, a genus of starﬁsh from tropical waters in
Indian and Paciﬁc Ocean. These starﬁsh are also known as cushion stars, and are
“pentagonal spheres”. Interestingly the juvenile form of these starﬁsh is a ﬂat
pentagon, inﬂating into a cushion star (Fig. 11.1).

In the same way we can study diatoms in their own geometry. A prepared mind
equipped with the new glasses can discover in natural sciences and natural history
an endless number of examples that can be described with our transformations. The
more one looks, the more we ﬁnd. In 2012, a superelliptical galaxy was discovered
[227], there are square bacteria in salt conditions [228], one ﬁnds hexagonal pat-
terns on Jupiter, or pear shaped nuclei in atoms [229], easily modelled as one-angles
in the same way bird’s eggs are one-angles [1]. Universal Natural Shapes refer to
natural shapes at all possible levels: in growing organisms, ﬂuid mechanics,
snowﬂakes, galaxies and elementary particles.
Singling out one example: triangular and square coilings of certain ammonite
fossils, like Entogonites saharensis (Fig. 11.2) and Soliclymenia paradoxa are well
known to experts. These are not some strange experiments, peculiarities, degen-
eratives or freaks of nature, but these genera thrived in their speciﬁc environments,
even with a wide geographical distribution, from the Late Devonian up to 360
Million years ago [230–232].
In Fig. 5.16 Future Fossils we encountered some very peculiar specimens har-
vested from our supershaped universe. One of those had some peculiar involutions.
Actually, it resembles the structures of certain fossils of the ammonoids

involutions, although less pronounced then our Future Fossil. This ﬁts well within a
morphological (and proposed phylogenetic) series of this group of ammonoids.
Equilibrium Shapes for Far-from-Equilibrium Conditions
Such shapes (Fig. 11.3) are results of optimization problems, much in the same way
as soap bubbles and ﬁlms are solutions to optimization problems, mathematically
described as constant mean curvature surfaces. The extension of spheres to Wulff
shapes and supershapes as unit spheres has been discussed before, but one should
also take into account differences in solutions in different directions. A cell in a
growing stem of plants will keep its width, but expand vertically. D’Arcy
Thompson wrote the equation as a generalized Laplace-Young equation taking into
account the curvatures, but with different tensions T1 and T2 in perpendicular
directions. Instead of the arithmetic mean of the curvatures we have a weighted
arithmetic mean. Koiso and Palmer [13] interpret this in the framework of constant
anisotropic mean curvature surface CAMC:
K ¼ T1
R1
þ T2
R2
¼ constant
ð11:1Þ
where K is the anisotropic mean curvature, 1/R1 = j1 and 1/R2 = j2 the principal
curvatures of a smooth surface, and T1 and T2 are orthogonally directed tensions

which depend on the material and the normal directions of the surface at each point.
K constant means that the anisotropic mean curvature is constant on the whole
surface and this surface then is called a CAMC surface.
Natural snowﬂakes provide nice examples. “Triangular” snowﬂakes retain their
hexagonal symmetry as supershapes, with alternating short and long sides, thereby
reﬂecting the molecular symmetry of ice. The ﬁrst systematic study on snowﬂakes
goes back to Kepler’s Strena seu de nive sexangula (1611), in which the
six-cornered snowﬂake was interpreted for the ﬁrst time in terms of the underlying
symmetry. Kepler based his consideration on close packing of spheres, and later the
underlying molecular symmetry of ice turned out to be six. The geometrical
description of snowﬂakes has not seen great progress, with the exception perhaps of
Aloysio Janner’s De nive sexangula stellata [233, 234].
In the past century quite a lot of research has been performed to understand the
physical basis. With a ﬁxed molecular symmetry, the growth and actual shape of the
snow crystal is dependent on a range of parameters. Snowﬂake diversity is enor-
mous, and one ﬁnds, among others, dendritic types, plates, (hollow) columns and
capped columns. From a physico-mathematical perspective, little progress has been
made. A major open problem in crystal formation is the existence of equilibrium
shapes.
Equilibrium surfaces have not been observed for snowﬂakes, at least not in the
classical sense and surface energies are thought to play negligible roles in snow-
ﬂake formation [235]. Spheres or classical Delaunay shapes, as equilibrium shapes,
have never been observed in snowﬂakes. When anisotropic energies are considered
however, a range of shapes of snowﬂakes can be seen as constant anisotropic mean
curvature CAMC surfaces for anisotropic energies. Such shapes then are equilib-
rium shapes for processes where very short formation times and long range cor-
relations (typical of far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics) dictate the development.
The existence of equilibrium shapes described by CAMC surfaces in crystal-
lography has the following results: First, a unifying descriptive approach for crystal
formation with very different formation times; second, it suggests strongly that
surface energies do play an important role, also far-from-equilibrium, and ﬁnally,
(snow)crystal growth can be embedded into the broader framework of submanifold
theory, the theory of shape. It is mentioned in passing that a wide range of the
shapes encountered in crystallography (cubes, prisms, triclinic, hexagonal…) are
simply supershapes. The shapes can easily be turned into hexagons, by admitting
one of the cross sections to become hexagons instead of squares. The resulting
Wulff shape will be a hexagonal prism, while the resulting minimal surface will be a
supercatenoid with hexagonal cross section, planes and (almost) right angles
between planes and caps (Fig. 11.4) [236].
Capped columns, simple prisms, needles, cups, bullets and other shapes of
snowﬂakes can thus be modeled and understood as equilibrium shapes with ani-
sotropy already from the very beginning, and this anisotropy is retained in fully
developed snowﬂakes. It should be clear that actual snowﬂakes are the result of
very complicated physical processes, but that CAMC surfaces as equilibrium
shapes for far-from-equilibrium conditions, provide a novel way of understanding
190
11
Snowﬂakes and Asclepiads

the aforementioned major open problem in snowﬂakes, that of equilibrium shapes
and surface energies.
Supershapes provide equilibrium shapes at all levels in nature (static or dynamic).
It seems in fact quite straightforward to look at ﬂowers, sea lilies and sand dollars.
During growth, development and during lifetime in general, they try to minimize
certain anisotropic energies. In the same way as the shapes of snowﬂakes are the
result of the molecular symmetry of ice which is imposed from the early stage of
nucleation and retained throughout, the symmetry of ﬂowers is the result of the
earliest stage of development, with the symmetry imposed from the start by the
ﬂower buds. Petals are solutions to minimize tension and stress. The shape and
development of petals (as one part of the ﬂower) is a mechanism to get rid of stress.
If a pentagonal cap is placed upon a developing square meristem, then it would grow
into a ﬂower with ﬁve petals and sepals, not four; it is a minimization or optimization
to reduce stress, in the very directions and shapes indicated by the curvatures.
In ﬂowers, the development of ﬂoral organs like sepals and petals is related to
getting rid of stress by expanding relatively planar structures. From a small
meristem of tenths of milimeters, they develop into smaller or larger structures (in
some cases up to ﬂowers of one meter or more). Stresses might be internalized in
other ways as well. The curvatures on a sand dollar like pentagon ﬁt well within the
pentagonal shape. In this case the stresses are internalized in a growing but
essentially static structure, but are then employed as functional entities: the ﬂoral
structure on the tests of sand dollar (Fig. 11.5) are actually used as opening from

which the tube feet extend [237]. Development of natural organisms is a beautiful
symphony, for those who are open to its sounds.
Fusion as Driving Force in the Evolution of Angiosperms
The development of ﬂowers is a major evolutionary step in plants, leading to
gymnosperms and angiosperms, and the major subdivisions of the latter into
monocots and dicots, with a variety of pollination syndromes. In particular, ﬂowers
enabled the evolution of insect-mediated pollination, a driving force in the rapid
evolution and radiation of both ﬂowering plants and pollinators. In the plant world
there are a large number of highly fascinating plants, with the most ingenious
methods of survival, pollinator deception, seed dispersal and much more. Few are
as fascinating as orchids. It was Darwin himself who started in depth research on
the fantastic pollination syndromes of orchids with many ingenious ways to attract
(and deceive) pollinators [238]. The attractive clues can be of visual or olfactory
nature, with the lip of the orchid resembling a female insect body, or the olfactory
clues matching precisely the olfactory composition of pheromones of female
insects.
One peculiar aspect of the orchid family is that the pollen is glued together in
pollinia, and it is the pollinia that are attached to the deceived pollinator, ﬂying off
to another ﬂower to reap real rewards (to be deceived once more). Aggregation of
pollen into pollinia in Orchidaceae proved to be highly efﬁcient in evolution,
increasing success in fertilisation. Innovations to increase the efﬁciency of polli-
nation combine pollinia with unique structures for attachment to pollinators that
often reduce self-pollination. In orchids such accessory structures are produced in
whole or in part by the stigma, so that pollen units have origins in both male and
female units. This is due to a special structure in which female (gynoecium) and
male (androecium) organs are fused into the orchid column. This is one of the main
reasons for the evolutionary success of orchids and the species richness of the
family [239, 240].
Our knowledge of ﬂowers, their diversity, development and rapid evolution is
still very limited. A general model, almost three decades old now is the ABC model
[241, 242]. Three groups of genes deﬁne four different whorls in ﬂowers, with
spatial restriction of the action of the genes, in sepals (only A), petals (AB), stamens
(BC) and pistils (only C genes active). The ABC model originated from studies in
Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum, whereby the various functions were identiﬁed via
loss of expression of the various groups, or via expression of well-identiﬁed genes
in other species. The model is basically simple, but less ubiquitous than it was
originally intended to be [243–245]. For example, the A function has been shown to
be less conserved and its function less clear, if any at all, in other plant species.

Inter and Intrawhorl Fusion in Flowers
Even considering some general applicability of the basics of the (A)BC model we
are only at the very beginning of understanding development and evolution of
ﬂowers. Improved understanding of the ﬂower as a determining factor in the
evolution of angiosperms, should involve the study of speciﬁc trends in the evo-
lution of ﬂoral morphology. Like the (A)BC model, such trends are an abstraction of
nature, but they have the advantage to result from observations spanning the whole
group of ﬂowering plants and their ancestors, not only model plants.
One major trend in the evolution of the ﬂower is the reduction of polymery to
oligomery, from numerous to fewer [246]. Polymery is associated with spiral
phyllotaxy, an undifferentiated perianth, the presence of staminodes, complex ﬂoral
vasculature, and typically trimery or dimery as the basic merosity of the ﬂower.
Polymery is observed in Nymphaea and Magnolia, or many monocot ﬂowers
(Fig. 11.6).
Oligomery is associated with whorled phyllotaxy and a basic condition of
diplostemony, whereby the number of stamens is twice the number of petals; the
outer whorl of the stamens is oriented in alignment with the sepals, the inner whorl
with the petals [247].
A second major trend is synorganization, in which two or more speciﬁc organs
or structural elements undergo fusion, within and between whorls, thus enabling the
conception of new functional entities. A whorled arrangement, radial symmetry,
and a small, ﬁxed number of ﬂoral organs (oligomery) are the major prerequisites
Fig. 11.6 Spiral phyllotaxy (upper row) and whorled phyllotaxy
Inter and Intrawhorl Fusion in Flowers
193

for the evolution of complex synorganizations. Synorganized structures are more
stable and enable the formation of larger ﬂowers, opening up new ways to
experiment with shape and function, such as the formation of three-dimensional
corollas with increased petal surface, enabling a wide spectrum of pollination
syndromes [246, 248, 249].
Inevitably the genetics of fusion will be unraveled but at present, to our
knowledge, the only molecularly deﬁned mutant that exhibits lack of fusion of both
carpels and petals is the Petunia maewest mutant [250, 251]. In Arabidopsis fusion
of sepals and petals is observed only in a speciﬁc mutant. For fusion to occur
growing organs must come into contact early during development and both size and
spatial separation of individual organs are important. The prevalence of fusion in
the perianth in dicots is associated with pentamery as the basic merosity, whereas in
tetramerous ﬂowers of Arabidopsis and in P. maewest mutants, the petals are
spaced too far apart to initiate fusion [252] (Fig. 11.7).
Orchids and Asclepiads
The same is true in monocots, where tepals are spaced 120° apart, hence the
separate tepals and lips in orchids. Despite the lack of fusion in sepal or petal
whorls, the fusion events between male and female whorls have largely driven the
evolution of orchids. Orchids are monocots but within the dicot group there is an
equally interesting group of plants, with absolutely fascinating ways of attracting
pollinators. These are the Asclepiads. They are small succulents growing in
semi-arid conditions in Asia and Africa, and they have evolved olfactory systems
resembling putrefaction, to attract insects preying on dying animals [253–255]. The
ﬂowers however are absolutely splendid, among the most beautiful in the plant
kingdom, with highly varied shapes and colors, and a highly complex pollination
apparatus with putrid or carrionlike odours. Fascinating colors in connection with
special structures fostering deceit, trapping and attachment of pollinia: the

Snowﬂakes and Asclepiads

Asclepiadaceae are known as the orchids among the dicots, with ﬂower sizes
ranging from a few millimeters to forty centimeters (Fig. 11.8).
In contrast to orchids, the pentamerous symmetry has allowed for fusion of
petals, leading to a large corolla. In Stapeliads (Asclepiadoideae) it is the thick and
ﬂeshy corolla that accounts for this size variation, not the inner organs. The corolla
originates from fusion of petals and forms a very stable structure necessary for the
development of the highly complex pollination apparatus located in the center. This
apparatus results from a very complicated and highly coordinated sequence of
fusion events, following the initiation of the different separate whorls in the ﬂower.
Fusion occurs immediately following formation of the structure (congenital), or
after the formation has been ﬁnalized (postgenital). Following their formation petals
start to fuse and also later free parts are fused, and the fused petals are partly
released at anthesis. The congenital union of stamens is followed by fusion of
stamens with petals into a corona. This is shown schematically, following [255], in
Fig. 11.9.
Postgenital fusion of carpels leads to the formation of a style head, to which
stamens are fused forming a gynostegium. This then leads to the formation of guide
rails and pollinaria. The pollinia are formed in the stamens, and the translator is
secreted at the surface of the style head. The ﬁrm connection between anthers and
style head by postgenital fusion is necessary for the formation of the pollinarium.
This complex organ, anthers plus style head is called gynostegium. Following the
independent formation of the (apocarpous) carpels, the apices fuse into a style head,
then later fuse with anthers. The ﬂower is a very complex pentamerous ﬂower, with
complicated internal chambers. The fertile parts are hidden in these chambers
(internation of the fertile parts) [255].
The absolutely remarkable fact is the extreme stability in this group of plants.
The mutual positions of the inner organs (part of the corona, stamens, carpels) are
strongly ﬁxed and precise. The size of the ﬂowers is very diverse, from few mil-
limeters to 40 cm (Stapelia gigantea). However it is only the corolla that is so
diverse in size, while the reproductive parts are always relatively small, owing to
functional constraints.

Orchids and Asclepiads

In order to coordinate such complex developmental processes, stability is a key
prerequisite and within the Stapeliads (as well as the other ±250 genera and 3400
species of the Asclepiadaceae) the mutual position of the ﬂoral parts is very pre-
cisely ﬁxed [253]. Hence, Stapeliads provide for an excellent model in the physical
sense (simple, stable and reproducible) and in the biological sense (stable and
reproducible, yet highly complex). Fusion in the corolla of Stapeliads can be
described by a geometrical model with Gielis transformations, based on two
opposing forces. The occurrence of a stable center is a direct consequence of fusion
and synorganization of the petals.
Corolla Shapes in Asclepiad Flowers
These transformations impose a global anisotropy and preferred directions on f(#).
In other words, they ‘constrain’ the growth of a function f(#) that wants to ‘expand’
or ‘develop’. We call these two opposing functions the Constraining Function CF
and the Developing Function DF, respectively.
When DF is a cosine function, rose or Grandi curves result, used to model
certain ﬂowers. When constrained by Gielis transformations GT they easily model a
much wider variety of ﬂowers. Indeed, by multiplying a rose curve DF with a
Fig. 11.9 Formation of Asclepiad ﬂower
196
11
Snowﬂakes and Asclepiads

Constraining Function CF, a wide range of ﬂowers can efﬁciently be described. The
petals in such ﬂowers are free standing, a condition known as choripetaly.
Zygomorphy can be obtained when rose curves are inscribed in asymmetric Gielis
curves (for example monogon or egg-like shapes for m = 1).
In sympetalous ﬂowers petals are fused to at least some extent and the operation
is not multiplication, but addition. Sympetalous ﬂowers or Asclepiad corollas are
obtained by weighted addition of the two functions CF and DF, deﬁned by a weight
parameter a with 0  a  1 (Fig. 11.10).

frerei. In Huernia recondita both functions contribute half (i.e. a = 0.5), the
arithmetic mean AM of CF and DF (Fig. 11.11).
A Three-Element System for Fusion in Corolla
Using the two basic operations from the MATHS-Box between DF and CF, the
shape of any ﬂower can be described by three strategies (X, Y and Z). The ﬁrst
strategy, X, deﬁnes DF (number and size of petals) and CF (constraining polygon).
Y and Z involve multiplication and addition of CF and DF respectively, allowing
for the description of choripetalous and sympetalous ﬂowers. X, Y and Z are then
combined into a three-component system, whereby X is present in all combinations
and choripetaly and sympetaly depend on the use of addition or multiplication.
Thunbergia alata is one example of a combination of X, Y and Z strategies
(Fig. 11.12).
The (X) strategy controls the individual functions (global anisotropy CF, and
petal size and number DF) and fulﬁlls the requirements for the ultimate outcome of
the Y and Z strategies, which are multiplication and addition of these functions
respectively. X differs from Y and Z, as A differs from B and C. As a three-element
system, X, Y and Z can be applied like the well-known (A)BC model for molecular
aspects of ﬂower development. The ABC model was initially deﬁned based on the
analysis of morphological mutants in only two species, treating A, B and C as
independent groups of genes. MADS-box genes are a group of transcription factors,
in the case of ﬂoral organs acting as homeotic genes, ensuring the development of a
speciﬁc pathway towards speciﬁc organs.
Though applicable in its basics, nature should be expected to have been (and
remain) ﬂexible with regard to the genetic set up of developmental processes.
Indeed, the rather diverged control of the A function has resulted in a revision of the
(A)BC model. The A-function establishes a ﬂoral context by its involvement in the
control of ﬂoral meristem identity; it provides the requirements necessary to enable
the B- and C-function genes to exert their control over ﬂoral organ identity, in the
very same way as X provides the necessary conditions for ﬂowers to form. Under
the conditions that one element always is switched on, a three element system
yields only four instead of eight developmental variants, which is one of the reasons
why the original ABC model has to be substituted by the (A)BC model.
Choripetaly and sympetaly in ﬂowers can be based on these two most ele-
mentary mathematical operations from the MATHS-Box, multiplication and addi-
tion, between a fundamental function and a constraining space. This then leads to
the (X)YZ system, which is a geometrical system, not only combinatorial. We only
need the two most elementary mathematical operations from the MATHS-box and
the simple relations between arithmetic AM and geometric GM means between CF
198

and DF to study ﬂower development and evolution. These classical means are
pivotal in number theory and the theory of surfaces. This is summarized in
Table 11.1.
A Highly Stable Corolla
The formation of the very intricate and complex ﬂowers requires a very stable
environment. This is provided by the corolla as a stable disc, which creates a
stress-free zone in the center of the corolla, and the stresses are all diverted towards
the tip of the petals. In Chap. 8 we already studied the vibrations of discs and used
the fusion of petals as one example. In choripetalous ﬂowers petal responses to
stress are restricted to each individual petal. In sympetalous ﬂowers the response
will be distributed in the corolla towards the periphery and in the center a stable
zone is created. This central zone is essentially stress free and more fusion or
synorganisation increases the size of the stable zone (Fig. 11.13).
Vibrations should be thought of as ways for the plate to get to rest as efﬁciently
as possible. The ﬁrst mode of vibrations of a ﬂoral drum indicates how ﬂowers can
develop with a central stable core. Singling out the ﬁrst mode of vibration does not
come as a surprise: the architecture of plants allows for separation of vibration

modes under wind stress and the original idea of Turing’s morphogenetic patterns is
to separate speciﬁc spatial and temporal modes in reaction-diffusion systems.
This biogeometrical strategy has predictive value: in this study the ﬂower was
ﬁxed in the center with free boundaries, but when ﬁxed at the edges, which is
physically realized when the perimeter of the corolla is stiffer than the central part,
the ﬁrst mode of vibration resembles the 3D deformation of the corolla as observed
in a variety of bell-shaped and tubular ﬂowers. The development of cups
(Asclepiads) and ﬂoral tubes (e.g. Petunia) then becomes simply the most logical
way for evolution to occur from a mathematical and physical point of view. Both
the corolla as a stable disc and deformations of the corolla into ﬂoral tubes are then
well-deﬁned responses to local and global stresses, both in a long time frame (evo)
or in a shorter one (devo).

Fast Forward Evolution: Combining Stochastic
and Deterministic Techniques
A major question is how key innovations as fusion can be stabilized and lead to
specialized groups as in Asclepiads and Rafﬂesiads. The key innovation of large
ﬂowers
with
fused
petals
of
Rafﬂesiaceae
evolved
very
fast
within
the
Euphorbiaceae with small ﬂowers. The whole group of Asclepiads also stabilized
this key innovation, and evolved into a very species-rich group. One way to
understand this fast evolution is to compare developments in computer science, in
particular the combination of stochastic (mutations in genetic algorithms) and
deterministic (e.g. Levenberg-Marquardt) methods in image analysis [204, 205].
In the ﬁrst step, the stochastic method provides one family of solutions for the
raw problem of determining the appropriate symmetry and the shape coefﬁcients
without any prior information. The ﬁne-tuning of an optimal solution is obtained in
the second step using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Consequently, this
strategy allows for robust and efﬁcient shape initialization with quick and accurate
determination of a solution.
This hybrid approach may help in unravelling natural evolutionary processes.
Such strategies may result in very efﬁcient strategies with short evolutionary times,
combining efﬁcient mutations with deterministic optimization strategies. Examples
are the mobilization and neo-functionalization of enzymes from the large pool of
enzymes, large numbers of offspring or epigenetic imprinting. Once a key inno-
vation is formed in evolution as a broad solution, rapid diversiﬁcation will follow,
with adaptations not only to physical conditions, but also towards biotic factors, not
in the least pollinators.
In this respect orchids (monocots) and asclepiads (dicots) share the formation of
a central column, pollinaria and complex olfactory patterns. Both groups are very
rich in species, resulting from the evolutionary success of the aggregation of pollen
into
pollinaria
and
the
formation
of
column
(Orchids)
and
gynostegium
(Asclepiads). The synorganisation leading to column in orchids or the gynostegium
in asclepiads is a key innovation that led to two groups very rich in species.
The main difference is the absence of fusion of tepals in orchids, but similar
biophysical principles may be the basis of deformations of the labellum in orchids,
when we study higher order components of the solutions. When a ﬂoral disc is
mounted on a stalk, the plate vibration example showed a deﬂection of stress
towards the pointed petal ends, creating a more stable zone. If however the con-
dition would be that the perimeter is ﬁxed and the whole inner domain is allowed to
vibrate, then a most natural solution to deal with stress is the formation of a bell
shape or tube. Many tendencies in plant development and evolution are simple
solutions to relatively simple problems of optimization. Once the direction of a
solution is favored it can become evolutionary stable, combining stochastic and
deterministic methods.

Beyond Asclepiads
The Stapeliad corolla as a physical (stability and reproducibility) and biological
system (complexity) is an excellent biogeometrical model for the study of sym-
metry, synorganization and stability in development and evolution in ﬂowers.
Synorganization is found in reproductive structures in over 80% of all angiosperms
and is very common in vegetative leaves and stems, irrespective whether synor-
ganised parts arise by fusion or apoptosis. Our model can be used to understand
fusion as the basis of the stunning stability and ﬂoral diversity in Asclepiadaceae
and the rapid evolution of giant ﬂowers of Rafﬂesia, Rhizanthes and Sapria within
the Euphorbiaceae; it may shed some light on the disproportionate number of
species bearing gigantic ﬂowers in sapromyiophilous species. Our model also
captures the evolutionary development of oligomery and fusion, two major trends
in the evolution of plants. It exhibits a very general applicability enabling to model
any ﬂower shape.
With major focus on the MADS BOX gene family in ﬂower formation, progress in
understanding fusion and synorganisation has been very slow. To study fusion or lack
thereof in ﬂowers Petunia maewest is still the major reference with reduced lateral
outgrowth of initially separate primordial, failing to fuse during development. This
process involves HOMEOBOX genes. MAW (Petunia maewest) encodes a member or
the WOX1 subfamily and the role of MAW/WOX1 homologues in other plants seem to
have similar phenotypes [243, 245, 250–252, 257, 258]. This does shed some light on
fusion, but a thorough study and understanding will need a multifaceted approach,
including physiology, biophysics and geometry [258] on various plant models
beyond Arabidopsis, such as Petunia [257] and Medicago [259].
With our biogeometrical approach a framework for understanding fusion in
plants is opened, helping to understand the ubiquity of synorganization in plants by
fusion between different parts and organs, as a major driving force in the evolution
of angiosperms [248, 249]. In fact spiral versus whorled growth is also a major
force in how plants are related phylogenetically. All lower plants, up to early
diverging monocots and dicots (such as Magnolia and water lily) show spiral
growth and spiral reproductive structures. Eudicots on the other hand have in
general, whorled phyllotaxy. The Lamiids are characterised by sympetaly, and two
main subgroups are distinguished by early or late sympetaly [248, 260]. In rosids
ﬂowers are choripetalous, but nevertheless ﬂowers succeed in building a diversity
of ﬂoral tubes due the ingenious way in which the lower parts of the petals have
special ribs and overlaps, as was shown in Geranium [261]. One thing is certain:
nature is very inventive and plants, from unicellular algae to giant trees, have
explored a wide variety of forms successfully colonizing a wide variety of habitats,
from a relatively compact genetic toolbox. Evolving from small euphorbia ﬂowers
to giant Rafﬂesia ﬂowers, or changing symmetry of perianths, many solutions have
been developed and are reused if needed. Perianth symmetry has changed at least
199 times during angiosperm evolution [262]. The Orchids (monocots) and
Apocynaceae (dicots) have evolved similar solutions, which led to species rich
202

Snowﬂakes and Asclepiads

groups in both cases [240]. Recent advances in next “supermodels” like Petunia
[263] will lead to rapid advances in understanding.
We also emphasize that synorganization is a broad phenomenon. For example,
the cardioid analogy applied to choripetalous and sympetalous ﬂowers then allows
for modeling a wide range of composite or palmate leaves with differing degrees of
fusion, as can be observed within the genus Acer. In an evo-devo perspective,
understanding ﬂower formation and evolution as the sound of drums favors the idea
of a co-active role of plants and pollinators in co-evolution. The weighted arith-
metic mean involves a close cooperation between two different entities. These may
be fusion of two organs, but also ‘fusion’ between outside and inside. Here outside
may be environment and inside the natural shape in developmental or evolutionary
sense.
The combination of trigonometric functions with Gielis transformations, with the
exact solution to boundary value problems in arbitrary domains, as applied here
with the Helmholtz equation for ﬂoral development and morphology, can in fact be
used in any ﬁeld of science. Flowers are just one graphical expression of the
equations used (Fig. 11.14). If we express the equations in time diagrams, our
ﬂowers will turn into waves.

The Pythagorean Theorem for the Third
Millenium
Retreat to Euclid.
A.N Alexandrov
Preserving the Pythagorean Theorem…
One uniform, Pythagorean-compact description with all the associated character-
istics that come for free allows for the study of natural shapes in a natural way. We
have strayed not too far from common ground using the normal rules of arithmetic
and circular (trigonometric) functions, and the total is compacted into a
Pythagorean structure. The genius of Pythagoras was, I repeat, the transformation of
circular motion into rectangular motion based on areas, and doing so by avoiding
geometric means.
The Gielis Formula describes a wide range of abstract and natural forms and
shapes, in the compact Pythagorean structure:
. #
ð Þ ¼
1
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
cos #
ð Þ

j2 þ sin #
ð Þ

We readily ﬁnd the generalized trigonometric functions p cos # and p sin #
associated with the shape and the corresponding generalized Pythagorean
Theorem (for Lamé curves; this can easily be extended to more general functions as
well) and conservation laws (area in the case of rectangular triangle). It is a simple
and straightforward generalization.
Let us look at this Pythagorean structure in a different way. In the transition from
Pythagorean Theorem a2 þ b2 ¼ c2 to the general equation of a circle, speciﬁc
numbers are substituted by variables x; y to arrive at x2 þ y2 ¼ R2: The variables x; y
are “placeholders” which can be substituted by certain numbers. A XYgraph of
the circle results when for all variables x we ﬁnd the corresponding variable y for
which the given equation holds.

In 1818 Gabriel Lamé generalized the circle: instead of 2, he made the exponent
into a variable n, which gives Lamé curves, more speciﬁcally supercircles. Squares,
circles and intermediate shapes differ only in the variable n:
xj jn þ yj jn ¼ Rn;
Using “placeholders” instead of numbers or variables, yields:
xj j þ yj j¼ R;
When we select the value  ¼ 2 we have the circle, if we select  ¼ 1 the
inscribed square results. For  ¼ 3 or  ¼ 5 we get supercircles, inﬂated compared
to the circle. We can choose any value (any real number) between 0 and inﬁnity,
and thus morph a square seamlessly into a circle or supercircle.
If the radius of the circle is 1, we can use, (instead of x; y) the cosine and the sine
of the angle #. The radius is always equal to one and the Pythagorean
Theorem gives cos2 # þ sin2# ¼ 1:
Converting Lamé’s equation into polar coordinates we arrive at:
. #

For  we can ﬁll in n, or three different numbers n1 or n2 or n3. We can also choose
to introduce some function f ðn1Þ, f ðn2Þ, f ðn3Þ whereby the value of n1, n2 and/or n3
changes along the shape or over time, for example evolving from circle to a starﬁsh.
For the placeholder . . . we can ﬁll in # (Lamé curves, and the circle if n ¼ 2), or m
4 #
(Gielis curves and transformations), or f ð#Þ for the generalization of Gielis curves we
introduced earlier. Within these two,  is the shape factor and . . . is the symmetry
factor. The former can morph a circle into starﬁsh or a square and back, the latter
deﬁnes the symmetry or spacing of the angle, and whether we get a square or a starﬁsh.
The result is that . #
ð Þ becomes a variable of stretchable radius, whose length is
dependent on the actual numbers used in the placeholder , and the spacing of the
radii depends on . . .. With those two we can morph a circle into any of the shapes
shown in this book, and a zillion more.

The Pythagorean Theorem for the Third Millenium

…With Elementary Mathematics
We have used only elementary mathematics. Foundations laid by ancient Greeks,
basic rules of arithmetic, games of cubes and beams, conic sections and a modern
version of the Pythagorean Theorem are all the ingredients needed to arrive at a
mathematical technique, expanding and generalizing Lamé’s calculus, useful for
studies in geometry and the natural sciences (and also arithmetic, algebra and so on).
One should not confound elementary and basic, with superﬁcial. On the con-
trary: a deeper understanding of the foundations of the inheritance from Ancient
Greek mathematics led us to these developments. Greek mathematicians themselves
built on earlier ﬁndings from other cultures, but they not only added the idea of
deduction and proofs, but also strived for a description as simple as possible. This
became the circle and conic sections, projectively equivalent to the circle.
These conic sections could be derived from the application of areas and the
various means ðAM; GM; HMÞ of the Pythagoreans, and were studied in detail by
one of the greatest mathematicians of ancient history, Apollonius of Perga. Twenty
centuries after Pythagoras, these conic sections formed the basis of our scientiﬁc
revolution(s), through Kepler, Galilei, Newton and Fourier, to name a few.
The tendency has largely been to neglect the source, and focus on expansions
and novelties. Instead of the source and the river that sprang from it, we now see
only the delta, an intricate system of small rivers, creeks and canals. We ﬁnd
ourselves in a Tower of Babel situation with each subﬁeld continuously ﬁghting or
struggling to prove and improve its importance. In each direction we ﬁnd hyper-
specialists, with high-level languages that are only spoken and understood by a few
and among all ﬁelds it seems that algebra and algorithm have taken the lead,
neglecting the geometrical foundations. What can easily be understood by geo-
metrical reasoning is reduced to algorithms, algebra, all types of new kinds of
sciences, erasing the past.
The Geometree however, is very much alive and thriving, as we showed. The
foundations the ancient Greek provided are deep and fundamental, the river that
sprang from this source continues to provide millions of tons of fresh water to our
delta. In this sense, all mathematics and its applications in the natural sciences
should be elementary, built on solid Elements or Rsove~ia:
Preserving Euclidean Geometry
Considering the more general transformations instead of the various instances for
suitable choices of parameters, we add semi-rigidity to Euclidean geometric
transformations (translation, rotation, reﬂection, glide reﬂection and scaling).
Deﬁning unit circles in a different way in Euclid’s set of deﬁnitions and thinking of
circle, square and starﬁsh as commensurable ﬁgures, Euclidean geometry can be
generalized greatly, encompassing many earlier results in mathematics.
…With Elementary Mathematics
209

Natural organisms, shapes and forms are Euclidean objects then and widely
varying simple and complex objects, forms and shapes, forming the complex set of
abstract or natural objects, are now equally simple. It corroborates Thom’s dictum
that “The dilemma posed by all scientiﬁc explanation is this: magic or geometry.
Classical Euclidean geometry can be considered as magic; at the price of minimal
distortion of appearances (a point without size, a line without width) the purely
formal language of geometry describes adequately the reality of space. We might
say, in this sense, that geometry is successful magic”.
A continuous transformation connects different unit circles that are found in
nature and we remain within the Euclidean framework. We expanded the deﬁni-
tions of curvature, based on the deﬁnition itself, in the spirit of classical Euclidean
geometry where the circle is the measure of curvature.
With our description of shape we can model a wide variety of natural shapes.
This
description
of
shape
can
be
a
most
compact
description,
in
the
Pythagorean-compact sense, a best ﬁt description in Chebyshev’ sense, yielding
optimal coordinate systems or garment adapted to the shape in the sense of Lamé,
or best model in the Aikake sense. It can be used to model various natural pro-
cesses, comparable to or better than current methods. Its capacity to transform
shapes widens the capabilities of current methods, many of those dating back to the
18th and 19th century.
While providing various new methods and tools, we are essentially describing
and modeling nature. Even if the models are better, we understand the limitations of
man in a way similar to Euler. Vladimir Arnold wrote: “The mathematical tech-
nique of modeling consists of ignoring this trouble and speaking about your
deductive model in such a way as if it coincided with reality. The fact that this path,
which is obviously incorrect from the point of view of natural science, often leads to
useful results in physics is called “the inconceivable effectiveness of mathematics in
natural sciences” (or “the Wigner principle”)” [8].
What if?
In 2018 we celebrate the bicentennial of Lamé curves; they are known as
superellipses and supercircles, but deep down they are the geometrical equivalent of
the Last Theorem of Fermat and a generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem with
a direct link to the study of nature. They originate in the study of natural shapes
since Lamé found these curves excellent for applying geometrical methods to the
study of crystals. Gabriel Lamé clearly understood the generality of his ﬁndings, but
also recognized their limitations. Gielis curves are only two decades old, but they
apply the ideas of Lamé for any symmetry, also motivated by the desire to describe
and study natural shapes. In this way they make Lamé’s new calculus applicable to
a much wider range of abstract and natural shapes. We ﬁnd that Gielis curves
provide excellent models for the study of natural shapes and phenomena.
210

The Pythagorean Theorem for the Third Millenium

The only strange aspect is that they are separated by 180 years, whereas all
ingredients were available in the second decade of the 19th century, with Lamé and
Gauss. When this was realized at that époque, Fourier’s results could have been
generalized to any domain already then, instead of 200 years later. Gauss would
have noticed the correspondence with his elliptic functions and arithmetic-
geometric mean. Time dilatation and increasing weight with increasing speed in
Special Relativity Theory would not have been strange at all, but only one
demonstration of the “Lamé” ﬁngerprint in nature. The study of natural shapes
would have been possible with their speciﬁc trigonometric identities and
Pythagorean Theorem.
Riemann would have given the fourth power as distance function more consid-
eration and would have recognized its signiﬁcance from a geometrical point of view.
What Riemann felt correctly, at least in one sense of the word, is that this would not
contribute much new. Indeed, by our transformations everything can be mapped
back to the circle and trigonometric functions, corroborating the excellent work of
older mathematicians. He was not correct in at least one other sense: it provides us
with new glasses to study nature, its shapes and its phenomena.
Deterministic and Structurally Stable
There is also a “beyond” view. I believe it allows us to look at mathematics and its
role in modeling natural processes quite differently, changing the way we look at
nature, and at ourselves as human beings, in relation to the world we live in, sharing
ecosystems with other beings of organic or inorganic nature. How then could this
inﬂuence our current worldviews?
When Pythagoras envisioned and taught his doctrine ‘All is number’, the circle
became the cypher of the world, together with the conic sections. From the very
moment that Gabriel Lamé conceived his book of 1818, all Lamé curves, with their
direct connection to many ﬁelds in mathematics, were completely deﬁned in their
‘ﬁnal’ form. The generalization of Lamé curves into Gielis curves and surfaces is
completed since 1997. The connection with many other ﬁelds, outlined in this book,
will provide food for thought, in particular transformations of Euclidean forms and
semi-rigid geometry. Its major “beyond” impact could well be in bridging the
differential and the difference—the continuous and the discrete—using more gen-
eral geometric deﬁnitions of differentiation and manifolds, combining the smooth
and piecewise linear.
Another way how it could inﬂuence our views is that we can think more
deterministically, less governed by pure chance. It is clear that our world is not
chaotic or random, but a cosmos, well arranged and ordered. Certainly it is dynamic
and moving all the time, but a certain order and harmony is the imprint of nature.
Even when our dynamical systems show ﬁngerprints of chaos, one can use Lamé-
Gielis curves to increase structural stability. One example: the transition to chaos
with the logistic equation may be damped by slightly modifying the exponent of the
What if?
211

logistic equation from 2 to 2.3 or so; chaos does not set in so easily. Generalized
Möbius-Listing bodies, cut a certain number of times, facilitate the study of various
dynamic systems, the structure and the beating of a heart, the formation of galaxies
and planetary systems, or the behavior of elementary particles.
Our cosmos is by and large deterministic, rather than based on chance and
contingency. Hence, our worldviews can also become more deterministic. Chance
has led to remarkable progress in science especially wherever chance is used in a
way to describe microscopic systems governed by chance, leading to structurally
stable systems at the macroscopic level. Our world is structurally stable.
Let us be clear: A worldview based on pure chance is a priori anti-scientiﬁc.
Acknowledging that there are a number of natural phenomena that we can never
model is giving up on understanding (resorting to computations at most). This
belief in pure chance is entirely negative, without any scientiﬁc interest. René Thom
wrote: «Le hasard est un concept entièrement négatif, vide, donc sans intérêt
scientiﬁque. Le déterminisme en science n’est pas une donnée, c’est une conquête.
En cela, les zélateurs du hasard sont les apôtres de la désertion» [264].
Determinism in science is not a given but the real victory of science. Also laws of
probability or Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies are deterministic.
Geometry is fundamental in any scientiﬁc description of the world, and with our
continuous transformation (or subsets) we can describe many more phenomena and
shapes without having to resort to pure chance or pure randomness as the ultimate
foundations of natural phenomena.
Plants at the Core of Our Worldview
The idea of Gielis transformations originated in the study of plants, in particular of
square bamboos and the hollow culms of bamboo. This led to a Pythagorean
compact description of a variety of natural and abstract shapes, describing the
symmetry and dimension of simple and complex shapes in plants. From simple
algae and diatoms, to the lower and higher plants, two to six parameters sufﬁce for
the accurate description and quantiﬁcation of the shape of plant organs, tissues and
cells. For the modular architecture of plants, a logico-geometrical methodology was
presented, based on R-functions, whereby domains could be described efﬁciently
and studied quantitatively. Such domains could be layers of onions or bamboo
shoots, or annual rings in trees. Modular architecture is also the efﬁcient stacking of
vessels in wood, or the packing of cells in sporangia.
The two basic shapes in nature, circle and spiral, can be discerned everywhere, in
the growth of organs, the transition of vegetative to generative organs, the phyl-
lotaxy in plants, up to the evolutionary pathways, from spiral polymery to whorled
oligomery. A geometrical model was proposed to study fusion of petals in
Asclepiads, whereby the formation of a ﬂoral tube, either resulting from true fusion
or from clever mechanisms in Geranium, is a very natural consequence of vibra-
tions affecting the ﬂower. Several methods were proposed to study plants in the
212
12
The Pythagorean Theorem for the Third Millenium

very same way as various physical phenomena are studied. The highly improved
accuracy to model plant parts results in more accurate allometric laws, based on
geometric rather than arithmetic means. This is summarized in Table 12.1, and can
easily be extended using Gielis transformations for any study in the natural
sciences.
Physis-Centered Worldviews
In understanding natural objects and phenomena our scientiﬁc methods and
worldviews are by and large based on our human modeling, with circular glasses to
look at nature; these methods are Euclidean or Euclidean in disguise, having
straight lines and circles as the main focal points in whatever we do. However, these
glasses are our bulls in the collections of delicate porcelain and ﬁligree, which
nature is. We cast, very “anthropomorphically” and “anthropometrically” our
human nets over nature, but fail to understand it. We should start thinking in
geometries adapted to the shape. With our approach, we provide for unit circles
adapted to the natural shapes. If starﬁsh would develop geometries based on their
experience of this world, their unit circle may well be the starﬁsh itself. And the
shape of petals in ﬂowers is related to the curvature imposed by the unit circle of
early developing ﬂower buds.
We now have new glasses, microscopes and telescopes that allow us to look at
nature beyond our myopic anthropomorphic instruments and the good news is that
such unit circles are members of a continuum of unit circles. They can all be
connected to our classic circles and circular functions and we can extend our
Euclidean geometry with our semi-rigid transformations. We can develop natural
coordinate systems onto natural objects and phenomena, following the vision of
Gabriel Lamé and his dream of a Unique Rational Science.
Human-Centered Worldviews
We have argued earlier how Lamé curves focus on pure numbers avoiding the use of
geometric means. In the evolution of science geometric means have led to the
classical “statistical” approach, with laws of large numbers etc., and we classify

objects in classes or topoi, and deﬁne relations between them. Persons X, Y and
Z may be in the same class, based on 98% of commonalities of say four traits.
Unfortunately, these methods are not used to understand humans, but predominantly
to exert control over groups and populations.
Mathematics has thus become the “science of patterns”, of commonalities. This
is incomplete: mathematics should and could be, like natural language (including
art and poetry), a way of expressing very deep feelings and individual aspects.
Persons X, Y and Z may have three or ﬁve aspects in common, but they are different
in a million more. We should not even call them X, Y or Z. All leaves on a tree are
different, and so are all cells inside an organism. Together with all other elementary
particles, electrons are mathematical abstractions, but for any sane person it is
impossible to believe that every electron, or every proton in the whole universe is
exactly the same.
The basis of Lamé curves and Gielis transformations is avoiding geometric
means and I have argued that this new view of pure numbers is not antagonistic to
the current world-views, but dual. It is a way of describing accurately a very
speciﬁc sequence or series, without having to resort to stochastic systems. We are
now able to assign individual parameters to individual starﬁsh, or to parallel cross
sections of cacti, or to developing shapes from circle to pentagon. Why not develop
a mathematical language to address the individuality in multiplicity, manifolds and
Mannigfaltigkeiten that can describe individual people, or any individual member
of the large catalogue of Universal Natural Shapes? The next natural step is then to
ﬁnd the ratios that harmonize the co-existence of individuals.
The Sixfold Way
We followed the rigorous scheme of building as developed by the ancient Greek.
pqόsări1 or Propositio exposed what needs to be shown, namely that beyond the
mere analogy, we can develop a rigorous geometrical and mathematical approach to
study natural shapes based on Lamé-Gielis curves and surfaces.
Ejheri1 or Expostio: From elementary notions in mathematics that are at work in
every ﬁeld of mathematics and its applications in the natural sciences, we arrived at
Lamé-Gielis curves and surfaces.
Dioqirlό1: in this determinatio step we showed how shapes and their combinations
can be ﬁrmly embedded into mathematics. Gielis is an acronym for Generalized (or
Geometric) Intrinsic and Extrinsic Lengths in Submanifolds. Length refers to
anything that can be measured and applies to a wide variety of natural shapes and
phenomena, for the study of everything we wish to understand— pάmsa ca lὰm sὰ

Kasarjetή or Constructio: Various methods have been presented, from the
Generalized Gielis formula, over R-functions to analytical solutions of boundary
value problems, using classical 19th century methods. Deﬁning curvatures, classical

via circles in the Oresme-Huyghens-Newton tradition, or based on Lamé curves and
supershapes, we construct powerful tools to study natural shapes. The relation
between Rhodonea curves and Chebyshev polynomials allowed for rewriting the
Gielis Formula.
Apόdeini1 or Demonstratio: Lamé and Gielis curves are excellent models for
studying various natural shapes, e.g. in bamboo leaves and tree rings. They provide
for an elegant and powerful way of representation for far-from-equilibrium shapes,
as in snowﬂakes and DNA. These models and their relation to old notions in
geometry help understanding evolutionary and developmental aspects in biology,
and fusion in Asclepiad corollas was used as example.
Rtlpέqarla or Conclusio: Many of the ideas from the original book Inventing the
Circle have been reﬁned and turned out to be very useful. Description always
precedes understanding
the
connections
between
mathematics
and nature.
Moreover, Lamé-Gielis curves and Gielis transformations open the door for many
new developments.
Among the various ideas and methods presented, I would like to mention three
main results: First, an “existence proof” that natural shapes can be described in a
Pythagorean-compact and Pythagorean-simple (oligomial) way, generalizing the
circle. Second, Lamé’s calculus, which Lamé himself considered to be difﬁcult, is
now made general and easy, and is fully embedded in the history and the main body
of mathematics and contemporary geometry, with Generalized (or Geometric)
Intrinsic and Extrinsic Lengths in Submanifolds, acronym Gielis. Third, the
expression of the Gielis Formula with Chebyshev polynomials links geometry and
algebra.
An Open Invitation to Mathematicians and Students
of Nature
When the Gielis Formula was published initially as Superformula, generalizing
Lamé-Hein’ superellipses, and Barr’s Superquadrics, this was met with enthusiasm
from within mathematics, and it was renamed as Gielis Formula, by mathematicians.
This formula can be considered as Gielis Transformations, giving rise to Gielis
curves, surfaces and submanifolds. In the past decade we have come to understand
that it ﬁts well into the long tradition of mathematics, broadening the applications of
the foundations laid down by the Ancient Greek mathematicians. As is shown in the
book, it is in fact, through Lamé equations, a generalization of circle and the
Pythagorean Theorem. We may consider this as a modern version of the
Pythagorean Theorem, broadening the scope to a wide range of natural and abstract
shapes, with a new pair of glasses. A Pythagorean Theorem for the Third Millenium.
Great challenges lie ahead. The geometrical foundations underlying all natural
laws of nature need to be combined with many of the observations from chemistry,
molecular biology, physiology and biochemistry, as well as from the ﬁeld of
The Sixfold Way
215

mechanics (dynamics and kinematics). We need to build bridges with “seasoned
experimentalists used to working with living matter and always struggling with an
elusive reality”, to ﬁnally arrive at “an abstract, purely geometrical theory of
morphogenesis, independent of the substrate of forms and the nature of the forces
that create them”. This geometrical theory of morphogenesis applies to all natural
shapes at all levels, not only living matter.
We need not to stray too far from Euclidean geometry, since this is what we know
and experience as human beings. I wish to add three crucial aspects. First of all,
observations are crucial, and one should at all times be aware that our models are
based on a theoretical framework that is always somewhat biased, even if 99.99% of
scientists agree. For the observation of phenomena we should not limit ourselves to
our inner scientist circles. Goethe’s observations turned out to be crucial for
understanding plants from a dynamical perspective [265]. There are shapes inbe-
tween circle and square but few realize that Lamé curves exist (remember Fig. 2.3).

The Pythagorean Theorem for the Third Millenium

Second, every human being is different, with his or her own talents and time needed
to process and understand information. Third, the rules of rational thinking are
incomplete. Our observations led us to different glasses, micro- and telescopes to
look at nature. The complex turned out to be simple. Human imagination is what
distinguishes us from computers, and what we should honour in education.
To B.L. van der Waerden’s “Every branch of mathematics can exist by itself as a
logical system. When we wish to develop mathematics as a living and growing
science, we can understand this only in the symbiosis with physics, and astronomy.
Only in this symbiosis can our beloved science blossom, grow and forever stay
young” [266], we must add “biology and botany”. Fortunately the close relationship
between Theory and Practice (Simon Stevin’s Spiegeling en Daet), has always
been pivotal in all of scientiﬁc developments and breakthroughs. Geometry, and
botany and nature in general, are successful magic (Fig. 12.1).
