Abstract.
In the context of quantum gravity theories, several researchers have proposed
causal sets as appropriate discrete models of spacetime. We investigate families of causal sets
obtained from two simple models of computation – 2D Turing machines and network mobile
automata – that operate on ’high-dimensional’ supports, namely 2D arrays of cells and planar
graphs, respectively. We study a number of quantitative and qualitative emergent properties
of these causal sets, including dimension, curvature and localized structures, or ’particles’. We
show how the possibility to detect and separate particles from background space depends on
the choice between a global or local view at the causal set. Finally, we spot very rare cases of
pseudo-randomness, or deterministic chaos; these exhibit a spontaneous phenomenon of ’causal
compartmentation’ that appears as a prerequisite for the occurrence of anything of physical
interest in the evolution of spacetime.
1. Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to progress investigation in an area of fundamental physics that we
locate at the intersection between the Causal Set Programme and the Computational Universe
Conjecture.
Causality among events is widely recognized as a most fundamental aspect of
spacetime, and the concept of causal set has been formulated in the homonymous research
programme [1, 2, 3] in ”an attempt to combine the twin ideas of discreteness and order to
produce a structure on which a theory of quantum gravity can be based” [4]. The fundamental
idea at the root of the Causal Set Programme is summarized by the conceptual equation:
”spacetime geometry = order + number”.
A causal set (or ’causet’) is a ﬁnitary partially ordered set, that is, a set of events provided with
a binary relation ’≺’ which is reﬂexive, antisymmetric and transitive, and such that the number
of elements between any two events is ﬁnite. A causet is meant to represent an instance of
discrete spacetime in which causality is reﬂected by the ’≺’ relation (’order’), and the volume of
a given region is measured by the count of nodes in it (’number’). Causets are important because
the order and number information that they encode is suﬃcient for completely determining the
metric tensors of General Relativity (see e.g. [2]).
The idea of a discrete universe is also adopted in the Computational Universe Conjecture,
which, in its most extreme form, suggests that all the complexity we observe in the physical
universe should emerge from the iteration of a few simple transition rules, and could be fully
reproduced by running a short computer program. In this case, the conceptual equation is:
”complexity in physics = emergence in computation”.

Figure 1. 500-step computation of Wolfram’s Elementary Cellular Automaton 110. Interacting
’particles’ always emerge, from any random initial conﬁguration.
The fact that complex patterns resembling those found in nature can originate from simple
computations is widely recognized today, and has been investigated and popularized in particular
by S. Wolfram, with his extensive analysis of the ’spontaneous’ behavior of cellular automata
and other simple models [5]. An example of a structure emerging from the computation of an
elementary cellular automaton is illustrated in Figure 1. In the depicted bit array, the ﬁrst
row is random and each bit in the subsequent rows is computed by a boolean function of three
variables:
bi+1,j = (¬bi,j−1 ∧bi,j ∧bi,j+1) ⊕bi,j ⊕bi,j+1,
where ⊕is exclusive OR and column indices rotate, the last on the right being followed by the
ﬁrst on the left. Cellular automata diagrams are indeed commonly interpreted as space-time
structures, with space expanding horizontally and time ﬂowing downward. However, unlike in
causets, neither events nor causal links are explicitly represented in this type of diagram.
We believe that causets represent an excellent opportunity for progressing research on the
computational universe conjecture, due to the fact that they come with a clear, explicit physical
interpretation, and due to their relevance in current quantum gravity research. Thus, our main
objectives in this paper are: (i) to explore, by computer simulations, the causets that can be
obtained from the ’spontaneous’ computations of some simple deterministic algorithms, (ii) to
analyze some of their quantitative and qualitative properties, with the idea to compare them with
those considered in the Causal Set Programme. Our hope is to promote some cross-fertilization
between the two approaches in terms of techniques and speciﬁc research items.
2. Causets from simple models of computation
The idea of describing computations as networks of causally related events has been ﬁrst
introduced, to our knowledge, by Levin: ”A causal net can be interpreted as the time-space
history of all elementary operations accomplished in the computing process, with their mutual
dependencies indicated” [6]. The purpose of these nets, however, was to characterize computable
functions; it is only by the more recent work of Wolfram that these directed graphs are viewed
as possible instances of physical spacetime.
In [7] (see also [8]) we have described a general criterion for deriving causets from virtually
any model of computation. In summary, the idea is as follows. A computation is deﬁned as
a sequence of composite states, and a computation step as a pair of adjacent states.
Each
computation step becomes an event in the causet. Then, a causal link is created from event ei
to event ej, with i < j, whenever ej is the ﬁrst event occurring after ei to read a global state

component that was aﬀected by ei: that state component has acted as a causality mediator
between the two events. 1 Finally, letting R denote the relation deﬁned by the above links, the
full causality relation is obtained by taking the transitive closure of R. Note that the above
relation is antisymmetric by construction.
It may be sometimes useful to also consider the
transitive reduction of R, which is the minimal relation whose transitive closure is the same
as the transitive closure of R. When R is antisymmetric and ﬁnite, the transitive reduction is
unique.
In [7] we have explored causet families associated with a number of models, including various
classes of one-dimensional Turing machines, mobile automata on tape, string rewrite systems
and tag systems.
All those models operate on a one-dimensional support, such as a tape
or a string of symbols.
In this paper we extend our exploration by considering two models
of computation that operate on higher-dimensional supports, namely 2-D arrays of cells and
planar trivalent graphs.
As with our previous investigation, our attitude is one of avoiding
predetermined expectations, while being open to anything interesting that might emerge. Two
obvious items of interest, however, are the emergent dimensionality (or ’dimension’) of the
causet, and its curvature. Thus, before illustrating our algorithmic causet families, we brieﬂy
discuss how we have addressed these quantitative features.
2.1. Causet dimension and curvature by shortest-path node-shell growth
A simple way to assign a dimension to an undirected graph consists in considering the size S(d)
of the node-shells at progressive distance d from a generic node, where distance is measured by
the edge count of the shortest-path between nodes. If S(d) = O(dn), we assign dimension n + 1
to the graph. In the case of undirected graphs this concept is deﬁned, for example, in [9].
We apply the same idea to causets, that are directed, acyclic graphs.
One can deﬁne a
quantity:
Dx(d) := log(Sx(d))/log(d) + 1
relative to some node x of the causet, where Sx(d) is the size of the node-shell at distance d
from x. Then the causet has node-shell dimension Dx := limd−>∞Dx(d), starting from node x,
when such limit exists, and it has node-shell dimension D whenever Dx = D for all x.
What if node-shell growth is not polynomial?
In our experience, if we exclude cases in
which large ﬂuctuations prevent the identiﬁcation of a deﬁnite growth rate, the only alternative
is exponential growth.
We interpret it as a sign of negative curvature, while suspending
judgement about dimension. This choice is justiﬁed by an analogy with the continuous case: a
circumference of radius r in a hyperbolic surface with negative Gaussian curvature K has length
c(r) = 2πrsinh(r/R), where R = 1/
√
−K, and in the expansion of the hyperbolic sine function
sinh(x) = 1/2 ∗(ex −e−x) the predominant term is indeed a positive exponential.
2.2. Causets from two-dimensional Turing machines
A two-dimensional Turing machine is a Turing machine in which the control head operates on
a 2-D array of cells, containing symbols from a given alphabet. For each value p of the current
control head state, and each symbol a read in the current cell c, the state transition table
describing the control head behavior provides a triple (p′, a′, d), indicating the new control head
state p′, the new symbol a′ to be written in c, and the move of the control head, expressed as a
vertical or horizontal, unit-length displacement d from c. By convention, we start computations
with the array ﬁlled uniformly, say with 0’s. No termination conditions are imposed.
1 The total order of computation steps does not represent physical time; the latter, as well as space, can only
emerge (if ever) from the growing structure of the causet, which does not keep explicit track (e.g. by node labels)
of that total order.

(s = 2, k = 3). 1-D (left), 2-D ﬂat (center), negatively curved (right).
The instantiation of the general causet construction method for this model is simple. Causal
links are mediated by two global state components: tape cells and control state. Thus:
• Every step of the machine corresponds to an event of the causet.
• A directed edge connects event ei to event ej iﬀej reads a cell that was written by ei, and
by no other event in between.
• A directed edge connects each event ei to its successor ei+1, since the latter reads the control
head state that is set by the former.
A consequence of the last bullet is that these causets will always be totally ordered. 2
Using shortest-path node-shell growth analysis, we have examined families of causets from
classes of 2-D Turing machines characterized by various settings of parameters s (number of
control states) and k (tape alphabet size). The number of diﬀerent 2-D Turing machines for
given s and k is (4sk)sk. The simplest class we consider is (s = 2, k = 2), consisting of 65,536
elements. We ﬁnd that all of the causets in this class are 1-D; an example is shown in Figure
2 (left). By considering class (s = 2, k = 3), we still ﬁnd that the vast majority of causets are
1-D, with exceptionally rare cases of two diﬀerent types: regular, ﬂat 2-D grids and negatively
curved causets (see Figure 2). 3
In search for more interesting behaviors, we have considered turmites [10]. They are a subclass
of 2-D Turing machines for which the motion of the control head is described in terms of left
and right turns relative to the current head orientation. The most famous turmite is Langton’s
ant [11]. In [10], 44 turmites with particularly interesting behavior have been identiﬁed; we have
derived causets for all of them, thus discovering interesting quantitative and qualitative features.
Two examples are shown in Figure 3.
The highest causet dimensions we have found in this family fall around 3.5, which is higher
than any value found in [7]. For establishing these values we have computed the sizes of the
node-shells at progressive distance d from the root, and then found a best ﬁt for a preﬁx of
this numeric sequence, for excluding boundary eﬀects. The ﬁtting is based on the non-integer
monomial function a ∗db, where parameters a and b are positive real numbers: the estimated
dimension is then b + 1. We also detect a case of exponential node-shell growth; this is not
shown, for space reasons.
2 We discuss this potential limitation in the next subsection, in connection with particles.
3 These results closely resemble those found in [7] for 1-D Turing machines.

2.3. Particle detection: global vs. local view
Let us turn to qualitative aspects of turmite causets. One the most attractive features of cellular
automata is the emergence of localized structures, or ’particles’ (see Figure 1). In our previous
experiments [7] our search for particles was successful only in part: causets exhibited at most
one particle each, in the form of a spacetime trajectory at the border between two periodic 2-D
regions. We have now the more elaborate case of turmite 4 in Figure 3. The causet for this
machine consists of four triangular sectors formed by regular hexagonal grids, separated by four
’radii’ formed by octagons. On top of this structure, a localized perturbation creates a spiral.
By looking at both the spiral and the four radii as particles, the causet appears as a sort particle
collision diagram. Note that the graph is not planar; the non-planarity is introduced precisely
by the spiraling particle. We can however determine the combinatorial curvature for each node
in the planar region. Recall that, for a planar graph, the combinatorial curvature of node x is
deﬁned as
cc(x) := 1 −degree(x)/2 +
X
f∼x
(1/size(f))
where summation is over all faces f incident with x. In our graph, the four grid sectors are
ﬂat, their nodes having null combinatorial curvature, but the nodes of the octagons have three
diﬀerent non-null curvature values, namely -1/24, -1/12, +1/4, suggesting a possible relation
between the motion of the spiraling particle and the curvature of its ’background’.
So far we have used the term ’particle’ in a rather abstract way, for referring to emergent
localized structures that we can visually spot in causet diagrams. In doing so we have sloppily
ignored edge orientation, and, more importantly, we have considered causets exactly as obtained
by the described construction criterion, while ignoring the fact that the transitive reduction of
these graphs collapses into a trivial chain of spacetime events. We are not addressing here the

problem of retrieving a notion of (dynamic) space from a generic causet; but it is clear that
a necessary condition for appearance of space is the presence of pairs of events in a spacelike
relation, or anti-chains, and these cannot be found in a totally ordered set.
Should we conclude that Turing machine computations are unable to produce causets of any
interest for physics? Let c be the causet directly obtained from a Turing machine computation,
and let TC(c) and TR(c) denote, respectively, the transitive closure and transitive reduction of
c; clearly TR(c) ⊆c ⊆TC(c). Then, the question is whether the ’redundant’ edges in c−TR(c)
can be assigned any physical role. We believe they can: their meaning becomes apparent when
switching from a global to a local view at the causet structure. When we compute the transitive
reduction of the a totally ordered causet with redundant edges, these are washed away. But
when the reduction is applied locally, to small regions of the causet, then (some of) these edges
might survive, and reveal some spatial structure.
In the subsequent ﬁgures we illustrate this idea by focusing on small circular regions of causets
from turmite computations. A disk with center node c and radius r shall include all nodes found
at a distance at most r from c, regardless of edge orientation. When these disks are centered
at the causet root, the total order of the included spacetime events is (almost) completely
represented inside the disk, and the reduction process basically destroys all structure. But when
the disk is moved oﬀthe root, information on causal relations is only partial; this aﬀects the
reduction process and may expose local space and/or particles.
In Figure 4 we show the causet for Langton’s ant. The ant (the TM control head) settles to

a periodic motion – a ’highway’ – after about 11000 steps. This is reﬂected in the arm growing
from the main body of the causet. The picture shows the transitive reduction of a disk centered
at some event in the arm: this is essentially a plain chain. We conclude that, at the considered
scale, the causet arm does not extend spatially.
Figure 5 provides an example in which space and particle are preserved by the local transitive
reduction, unless the disk is centered to the causet root.
Note that the particle pattern is
simpliﬁed by the reduction.
Figure 6 provides a surprising example. The grid-like spatial structure is preserved by the
transitive reduction, unless a particle is present: in this case the grid basically disappears,

except for a portion corresponding to the ’shadow’ of the original particle trajectory (this is
barely visible in the lower-left diagram).
Figure 7 is the only case in which we initialize the cell array with a non-uniform 5 × 5
region. This computation, when observed on the cell array, exhibits the emergence of a ’two-way’
highway (lower-left diagram) that is more interesting than the ’one-way’ highway of Langton’s
ant: the ant now keeps oscillating between the two opposite endpoints of the linear structure,
while progressively extending it in both directions, thus implementing a sort of wave behavior.
When taking local views at this causet, we ﬁnd that basically all the structure is washed away
by the transitive reduction, as with Langton’s ant; the only space-like cells left (see lower-right
diagram) are organized in two sequences that correspond to the ant entering and leaving the
central, random-like region of the cell array.
We believe that the detection of particles in causets from computations is an interesting,
original result of this paper; localized structures may appear also in turmite diagrams, but the
two phenomena are not always coupled. The causet, not the 2D-grid of a Turing machine, or any
other computational support, is the right place where to look for particles, or their worldlines.

2.4. Causets from network mobile automata on trivalent planar graphs
Network mobile automata have been introduced and shortly discussed in [5], and further studied
in [12, 13]. A trinet is a planar, undirected, trivalent graph. A trinet mobile automaton is similar
to a 2-D Turing machine, except that the stateless control head moves on a trinet rather than
on an array of cells. At each computation step the control head performs a local graph rewriting
and moves to some nearby location. Both the rewrite rule and the next location are chosen
by some deterministic criterion. In our investigations we have always used 2-D Pachner moves,
sometimes called Expand, Contract and Exchange, that ﬁnd application also in Loop Quantum
Gravity (see, e.g., [14]). Each of these rules aﬀects three or four faces of the planar graph.
The instantiation of the general causet construction method is simple also in this case.
• Every step of the machine corresponds to an event of the causet.
• A directed edge connects event ei to event ej iﬀthe rewriting performed by ej aﬀects a planar
face of the trinet that has been previously aﬀected by ei (without further modiﬁcations in
between).
In [12, 13] we have explored two variants of the model, in both of which rule Contract is not
used. A ﬁrst variant, qualiﬁed as three-connectivity preserving, is deﬁned as follows:
(i) Start with a trinet consisting of two nodes connected by three parallel arcs. (This is the
smallest possible three-connected graph. A connected graph is n-connected when n is the
smallest number of edges one has to remove in order to disconnect it.)
(ii) Choose rule Exchange whenever it does not violate three-connectivity, otherwise choose
Expand.
(iii) Move the control head to a new nearby location which depends on the applied rule and on
a ﬁxed parameter (see [13] for details).

of node-shell sizes at progressive distance d from the causet root. Numeric codes as in [12, 13].
In the second variant, qualiﬁed as threshold-based, point (ii) is modiﬁed as follows: choose
Exchange whenever it does not create trinet faces with less than k sides, otherwise choose
Expand.
The two-parameter policy for control head moves is the same in the two variants,
and always involves short steps, in analogy with Turing machines. As a consequence, the faces
aﬀected by a step always partially overlap with those aﬀected by the next step, so that events
ei and ei+1 are always causally related, and the causet is, again, totally ordered. However, due
to the construction rule, each node has 3 or 4 incoming, and 3 or 4 outgoing arcs, except for
the ﬁrst node and those at the growth boundary, so that causet structures can still be far from
trivial, and they would remain so even after local transitive reduction.
Even with computations from this model, the large majority of causets are 1-D graphs of no
interest. However, several more interesting cases are found; two of them are illustrated in Figure
8. In the ﬁrst case the causet is negatively curved: the exponential node-shell growth is revealed
by the ﬂat region of the small inset diagram, showing the ratios of consecutive shell size values.
In the second case the causet exhibits an approximate node-shell dimension 3 from the root, as
revealed by the exponent of the non-integer monomial ﬁt.
The causets considered above manifest a considerable degree of regularity, or predictability;
this becomes even more apparent when tracing the motion of the control head (not shown here).
With the objective of modeling spacetime in mind, we are certainly interested in more chaotic
behaviors. In [12, 13] only three computations, out of a few thousand, could be singled out
for the surprising pseudo-random character of control head motion and resulting trinet graphs.
Their causets turn out to be rather similar, at least at small scales, and quite diﬀerent from
those in Figure 8. Their dimensionality analysis based on node-shell growth is made problematic

by the wide oscillations of shell sizes. However, one of these pseudo-random computations lends
itself to the illustration of a remarkable, emergent qualitative property, as discussed below.
2.5. Emergent compartmentation
What type of feature might we expect to see emerge in our computational spacetime models,
and in particular in those with pseudorandom character, on larger and larger scales, beside
particles and curvature? We suggest that one of the key features would be the self-organization
into components that achieve some form of independence from one another, as a necessary basis
for building further complexity and obtaining a multiplicity of phenomena (in principle, up to
chemistry and biology). In Figure 9 we show a remarkable, pseudo-random causet. The directed
graph is partitioned into three sub-segments, colored in white, gray, and black, in a progression
that reﬂects the sequence of computation steps. All grey events have occurred between white
and black events, and yet the white and black portions are in direct causal contact.
Thus,
the ’hole’ appearing in the graph is not a pure accident of the speciﬁc layout algorithm. This
phenomenon reﬂects the conﬁnement of the ’ant’ inside some region of the growing trinet for a
relatively large number of steps.
As one would expect, in experiments we have conducted with ’genuinely random’ causets, no
spontaneous formation of similar macroscopic compartments has been observed.
3. Conclusions
In this paper we have provided some experimental evidence that causets created by simple
deterministic algorithms exhibit a variety of interesting emergent properties of physical
signiﬁcance, that can not be obtained by probabilistic approaches.
Several items require further investigation. The node-shell growth analysis based on graph-
theoretic, shortest-path distance is weak in two aspects: it does not separate dimension and
curvature, and it does not match spacetime distance, which corresponds to the longest-path
between points. We have started using longest-path distance in our most recent experiments;
but we still need estimators that decouple dimension and curvature. We have identiﬁed localized
structures in some algorithmic causets, and have called them ’particles’, following terminology
commonly used for cellular automata; but we still have to discover whether and how these
structures exhibit wave/particle duality.
We plan to experiment with ant-based models of

computation that operate directly on the causet structure, rather than on an underlying memory
support. We expect this approach to possibly account for important phenomena from quantum
mechanics, e. g. Bell inequalities, that are out of the reach of our current models (this idea has
been suggested by Alex Lamb.)
