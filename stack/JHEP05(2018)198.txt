Abstract: We consider operators in N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory dual to closed string
states propagating on a class of LLM geometries. The LLM geometries we consider are
speciﬁed by a boundary condition that is a set of black rings on the LLM plane. When
projected to the LLM plane, the closed strings are polygons with all corners lying on the
outer edge of a single ring. The large N limit of correlators of these operators receives
contributions from non-planar diagrams even for the leading large N dynamics. Our in-
terest in these ﬂuctuations is because a previous weak coupling analysis argues that the
net eﬀect of summing the huge set of non-planar diagrams, is a simple rescaling of the ’t
Hooft coupling. We carry out some nontrivial checks of this proposal. Using the su(2|2)2
symmetry we determine the two magnon S-matrix and demonstrate that it agrees, up to
two loops, with a weak coupling computation performed in the CFT. We also compute
the ﬁrst ﬁnite size corrections to both the magnon and the dyonic magnon by constructing
solutions to the Nambu-Goto action that carry ﬁnite angular momentum. These ﬁnite size
computations constitute a strong coupling conﬁrmation of the proposal.

Introduction
There has been dramatic progress in our understanding of N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory,
motivated primarily by the AdS/CFT correspondence [1–3]. In particular, the dynamics
of the subspace of the CFT Hilbert space, spanned by operators with bare dimension J
with J2
N ≪1 is integrable in the large N limit [4, 5]. The discovery of this integrability has
enabled an exact computation of the spectrum of anomalous dimensions of the CFT [6].
Being exact, these results are correct even in the strong coupling limit of the theory.
Given this remarkable progress, one would like to know if there are other sectors of
the theory, whose dynamics is also integrable. In the article [7] a new integrable sector
was proposed and weak coupling evidence for the proposal was given.
The subsector
consists of small deformations about an LLM geometry [8]. The geometry is labeled by
a boundary condition that corresponds to a set of black rings on the LLM plane. The
– 1 –

JHEP05(2018)198
ﬂuctuations propagating on this geometry are closed strings, which when projected to the
LLM plane, are polygons with all corners lying on the outer edge of a single ring. The
operators corresponding to an LLM background with a closed string excitation have a
bare dimension of order N2. Consequently we describe these operators using the adjective
“heavy”. The large N limit of the correlators of these heavy operators are not correctly
captured by summing only planar diagrams: non-planar diagrams must be included to
capture the large N dynamics. The weak coupling analysis of [7] shows that the net eﬀect
of summing this huge class of diagrams is a simple rescaling of the ’t Hooft coupling. This
is an interesting result, since it immediately predicts the anomalous dimensions of these
operators in terms of the corresponding dimensions computed in the planar limit. It also
implies that the dynamics of this subsector is integrable.1 Our main motivation in this
article is to provide some nontrivial checks of the proposal of [7].
The proposal was checked in [7] by computing the one loop anomalous dimensions and
then using the su(2|2)2 symmetry [11, 12] to propose an exact dimension. The results
agree with the strong coupling prediction obtained from string theory [7]. Further, the
su(2|2)2 symmetry can be used to determine the two magnon S-matrix [11, 12] and this
too can be tested in perturbation theory. We will test this S-matrix against a weak coupling
computation performed in the CFT, up to two loops. Our comparison always tests ratios
of scattering amplitudes so that we never need the overall phase of the S-matrix. We ﬁnd
complete agreement between the weak coupling CFT results and the expansion of the exact
two magnon S-matrix.
The skeptical reader will not be convinced: indeed, all quantities compared so far are
completely determined by the su(2|2)2 symmetry, so one might wonder how strict these
tests are. It is well known that the su(2|2)2 symmetry does not determine the overall
phase of the S-matrix. In this article we test this phase. Speciﬁcally, we compute the ﬁrst
ﬁnite size corrections to both the magnon and the dyonic magnon. These corrections when
computed following L¨uscher (see for example [13]) are sensitive to the overall phase of the
S-matrix. We will follow [14] and construct solutions to the Nambu-Goto action that carry
ﬁnite angular momentum. We are then able to compute the ﬁnite size correction at strong
coupling. Remarkably these corrections are given by simply rescaling the ’t Hooft coupling
(after proper translation to the string theory description) in the AdS5×S5 result. This is
a non-trivial strong coupling test that the proposal of [7] passes.
In the next section we will review the construction of the CFT operators belonging to
our subsector. We also describe the action of the dilatation operator. Section 3 explains
the determination and some weak coupling tests of the two magnon S-matrix. In section 4
we compute ﬁnite size corrections for magnons and dyonic magnons. Our conclusions are
presented in section 5.

CFT analysis
The usual lore of the large N expansion simply does not apply when we consider operators
with a bare dimension that scales as N2 [8, 15–17]: the pertubation expansion is not

organized by the genus of ribbon graphs being summed and the large N limit is not captured
by summing planar diagrams. Fortunately, at least in the free theory, representation theory
can be used to provide a basis for the local operators of the theory and to compute the
sum of the complete set of ribbon graphs [18–25]. We will focus on the restricted Schur
polynomial basis. As we will see, these operators provide a very natural description of
closed strings propagating on an LLM geometry. When loop corrections are considered,
operators in the representation theory basis mix only weakly [26–34]. This is useful since
our goal is to diagonalize the dilatation operator.
2.1
Operators dual to LLM geometries
The LLM geometries are regular 1
2-BPS geometries that are asymptotically AdS5 × S5.
These geometries enjoy an R × SO(4) × SO(4) symmetry [8]. The general LLM geometry
is described by the metric (i, j = 1, 2)
ds2 = −h−2(dt + Vidxi)2 + h2(dy2 + dxidxi) + yeGdΩ3 + ye−Gd˜Ω3,
(2.1)
where
h−2 = 2y cosh(G),
z = 1
2 tanh(G)
y∂yVi = ϵij∂jz,
y(∂iVj −∂jVi) = ϵij∂yz.
(2.2)
The metric is completely determined by a single function z which depends on the three
coordinates y, x1 and x2. It is obtained by solving Laplace’s equation
∂i∂iz + y∂y
∂yz
y
= 0.
(2.3)
To obtain a regular geometry, the boundary conditions for z on the plane y = 0 (which
we will refer to as the LLM plane) must be chosen carefully.
Regularity requires that
z = ± 1
2 on the LLM plane. Any given boundary condition can be represented graphically
by coloring the LLM plane black when (z = −1
2) and white when (z = 1
2) [8].
We will focus on geometries given by concentric black annuli on the LLM plane. Each
possible supergravity geometry is dual to a Schur polynomial in the CFT [17]. The Schur
polynomial χR(Z) is constructed using a single complex adjoint scalar Z. Consequently
the R charge J and dimension ∆of this operator are related as ∆= J which is the BPS
condition. There is a concrete, explicit map between the Young diagram R labeling the
Schur polynomials and the coloring of the LLM plane. Each Schur polynomial corresponds
to a coloring of concentric annuli.
Vertical edges in R correspond to black annuli and
horizontal edges to white annuli. The area of each black ring is proportional to the number
of rows in the corresponding a vertical edge, while the area of each white ring is proportional
to the number of columns in the corresponding horizontal edge. An example of the map
between LLM plane colorings and Young diagrams is illustrated in ﬁgure 1 below. For a set
of rings having a total of E edges with radii Rl l = 1, 2, . . . , E the geometry is determined

Finally, given the concrete map between the Young diagram and the LLM boundary con-
dition, when we want to talk about an excitation localized on the LLM plane at the edge
of a given annulus we will simply talk about an excitation localized at a corner of the
Young diagram.
2.2
Closed strings propagating on LLM geometries
In [7] operators representing excitations localised at a single corner of a Young diagram were
constructed. These operators are dual to LLM geometries excited by strings localized at the
outer edge of the corresponding annulus. In this section we brieﬂy review the construction
of [7] and then extend it to the description of closed string states with a worldsheet that
visits the edges of multiple rings. The conjecture we want to test concerns strings localized
at a single edge, but we discuss the general case for completeness.
The restricted Schur polynomials are a basis for the local operators of the theory.
Consequently, an arbitrary operator O can be written as a linear combination of restricted
Schur polynomials as follows
O =
X
R,{r},α
aR,{r},αχR,{r},α(Z, Y, X, · · · )
(2.4)
The operator dual to a closed string state is a single trace operator. Focus on a single
trace operator O, given by the trace of a product of ﬁelds of the N = 4 super Yang-Mills
– 4 –

JHEP05(2018)198
theory. These ﬁelds may be adjoint scalars, adjoint fermions or covariant derivatives of
these ﬁelds [35, 36]. If we use a total of k species of ﬁelds then {r} is a collection of k
Young diagrams, one for each species. If we use ni ﬁelds of species i the corresponding
Young diagram ri has ni boxes. The Young diagram r1 corresponds to the Z ﬁeld. The
Young diagram R has n1 + n2 + . . . + nk boxes. The additional labels contained in α are
discrete labels distinguishing operators that carry the same R, {r} labels.
We will, as usual, think of the single trace operator as a one dimensional lattice. All
ﬁelds which are not Zs are impurities and we record their position on the lattice. Thus,
the operator O({l1 = 1, l2 = 4}) corresponds to a trace Tr (Y Z2Y ZJ−2).
Suppose now that we consider a closed string excitation of an LLM geometry, attached
to a particular corner of the Young diagram B describing the LLM geometry. The proposal
of [7] is that this operator is simply given by
OB =
X
R,{r},α
aR,{r},αχRB,{r1B,r2,··· ,rk},α(Z)
(2.5)
The coeﬃcients appearing in the sum (2.5) are identical to the coeﬃcients appearing
in (2.4). Including the background implies that we have included an enormous number
of extra Z ﬁelds. Consequently, the Young diagrams R and r1, both of which are sensitive
to the number of Z ﬁelds, are modiﬁed as indicated above. RB (or rB) is obtained by
attaching R (or r) to the relevant corner of the background Young diagram B.
The operator OB is signiﬁcantly more complicated than the single trace operator O.
Indeed, it has a complicated multitrace structure and a bare dimension of order N2. Nev-
ertheless using the representation theory approach, it is possible to compute free ﬁeld
correlators exactly, and to evaluate the action of the dilatation operator. Our goal in the
remainder of section 2 is to sketch how this is achieved. As we explained above, any gauge
invariant operator is given by a formula of this type
O(Z, Y, · · · ) =
X
L
aLχL(Z, Y, · · · )
(2.6)
where L stands for the complete label of Young diagrams plus discrete labels, spelled out
above. Recall that the content of a box in row i and column j of a Young diagram is given
by N −i + j. The coeﬃcients cL are characters or restricted characters. They depend only
on diﬀerences between contents of boxes and hence these coeﬃcients are the same whether
or not we have the background. Now, imagine that we compute a two point function
⟨OB,1(Z, Y, · · · )OB,2(Z, Y, · · · )†⟩=

=
X
L
a1
La2
L⟨χB,L(Z, Y, · · · )†χB,L(Z, Y, · · · )⟩
(2.7)
To move to the second line we use the fact the Schur polynomials are orthogonal. All of
the N dependence in this answer is in the values of factors of boxes in the Young diagram.
The factor of any box in the diagram is given by N plus the content of the box. When
there is no background these factors are all N plus an order 1 number. In the presence of
– 5 –

JHEP05(2018)198
the background these factors are shifted to N + M plus an order 1 number. M is of order
N and it depends on the speciﬁc corner at which the excitation is localized. Choosing
conventions so that the AdS5×S5 geometry is given by a black disk on the LLM plane of
radius 1,
q
N+M
N
gives the radius at which the excitation is localized. The computation of
the correlator (2.7) is highly nontrivial. It involves summing huge classes of both planar and
non-planar diagrams. In the end however we have a rather beautiful relationship between
correlators computed in the LLM background and correlators computed in AdS5×S5. The
relation is [37, 38] (see also [39–41] for related work reaching a similar conclusion)
⟨OB,1(Z, Y, · · · )OB,2(Z, Y, · · · )†⟩
χB(Z)χ†
B(Z)⟩
=
N + M
N
J
⟨O1(Z, Y, · · · )O2(Z, Y, · · · )†⟩
(2.8)
This relation holds in the large N limit and as long as the dimensions ∆1 and ∆2 of O1
and O2 obey (∆1)2 ≪N and (∆2)2 ≪N. Further, J is the number of Zs in O1 which
equals the number of Zs in O2 for a non-zero correlator. The simplest way to summarize
what is going on is simply to recognize that the complete eﬀect of summing the huge class
of non-planar diagrams is that each Z ﬁeld propagator has been rescaled by (N + M)/N.
We will now build operators stretched between diﬀerent corners of the Young diagram.
We will distribute the operator O over corners, labeled 1 and 2, of the background Young
diagram. The construction simply amounts to getting indices to contract correctly. This
is most simply achieved by writing our loop O as follows
Tr

Tr(V Zn1Y Zn2 · · · Y Znk)1 Tr(WZm1Y Zm2 · · · Y Zmq)2
(2.9)
where subscripts 1 and 2 indicate which corner the ﬁelds are attached to. We will write the
above loop as O((n1, n2, · · · , nk)1, (m1, m2, · · · , mq)2). We now express the single trace
factors Tr(V Zn1Y Zn2 · · · Y Znk)1 and Tr(WZm1Y Zm2 · · · Y Zmq)2 as a sum of rectricted
Schur polynomials and then attach each to a given corner using the method described
above. The separate Young diagrams of the two traces come together at diﬀerent corners
on the background. We can then act with the derivatives with respect to V and W to
ﬁnally contract all indices correctly. The generalization to operators stretched over multiple
corners is obvious.
2.3
Dilatation operator
The action of the dilatation operator is evaluated following [7], by breaking the problem
down into three steps:
1. Write the usual planar computation in the trivial background, in terms of characters.
2. Write the computation in the LLM background in terms of characters.
3. Use large N to develop a relationship between 1 and 2.

Figure 2. A closed string excitation of an LLM spacetime geometry. The magnons on the closed
string are labeled.
The result is similar to what we found for correlators in the previous subsection: the net
eﬀect of summing the enormous number of non-planar diagrams is a simple rescaling of
the ’t Hooft coupling. The details of this evaluation are similar to the manipulations given
in [7]. Rather than repeating these highly technical manipulations we simply state the
results and refer the reader to [7] for details.
Consider the closed string excitation given in ﬁgure 2. To spell out the general result,
we will give the action of the dilatation operator on a few magnons. Denote the factors
associated to the inward pointing corners of the Young diagram by c1 > c2 > c3 > c4.
Recall that
p ci
N gives the radius squared of the outer edges of the back regions (the three
rings or central disk) on the LLM plane.
The string shown in ﬁgure 2 is spread over
three regions, so that, in the notation of the previous subsection we write this loop as
OB ((n1, n2, n3, n4)1, (n5, n6, n7)2, (n8, n9, n10)3). The action of the dilatation operator on
magnon 4 for example, is given by

Figure 3. The energy of a magnon stretching between the two radii is determined by the length
of the diagonal of the parallel trapezium shown.
The coeﬃcient of the diagonal term is the sum of the factors at the two ends of the magnon.
The coeﬃcient of the hopping term is the square root of the product of the factors at the
two ends of the magnon. For a closed string with all magnon endpoints attached the edge
of a single ring associated to factor c, this simply amounts to rescaling the ’t Hooft coupling
λ →c
N λ. These are the excitations of interest to us in this study.
An immediate test of this dilatation operator is to see if we obtain the expected anoma-
lous dimension for each magnon. Consider a magnon stretching between two diﬀerent radii
r1 > r2 on the LLM plane, as shown in ﬁgure 3.
The energy of the magnon stretch-
ing between the two radii is given in terms of the length of the diagonal of the parallel
trapezium [43]. This length squared is given by Ptolemy’s theorem as
l2 = (r1 −r2)2 + 4r1r2 sin2 θ

The energy of the magnon is given by [43]
E =

Magnon scattering
The S-matrix for two magnon scattering is completely determined, up to a phase, by the
su(2|2)2 symmetry that our subsector enjoys [11]. In the next subsection we will obtain this
two magnon scattering matrix, for the general case that the magnons that scatter stretch
– 8 –

JHEP05(2018)198
between diﬀerent ring edges on the LLM plane. As a perturbative test of this result, we
expand the S-matrix in a weak coupling expansion and demonstrate agreement with one
and two loop magnon scattering in the CFT.
A remark is in order. In determining the S-matrix up to a phase we have not made
any use of integrability. The only input is the su(2|2)2 symmetry that our operators enjoy.
This symmetry is present whenever we deal with operators constructed using many Zs and
then doped with a much smaller number of impurities. This includes, for example, open
strings attached to giant gravitons as well as closed string excitations of LLM geometries.

One-loop
Our analysis in this subsection follows [42]. The reader may wish to consult this paper
for further background. We treat the dilatation operator as a Hamiltonian, and study the
resulting problem of magnon scattering. Introduce the wave function ψ(l1, l2, · · · ) as follows
O =
X
l0,l1,l2,···
ψ(l1, l2, · · · )OB((l0)0, (l1, . . .)1, (l2, · · · )2, · · · ) .
(3.13)
The magnons at l1 (magnon 1) and l2 (magnon 2) meet at the edge of an annulus of radius
squared r2
0 = co
N . Magnon 1 stretches to the edge of an annulus of radius squared r2
1 = c1
N
and magnon 2 to the edge of an annulus of radius squared r2
2 = c2
N . We do not assume
any ordering of c0, c1 and c2. These two magnons are well separated from the remaining
magnons (so we can consider them on their own) and are both taken to be Y impuri-
ties, which is general enough for our study. The time independent Schr¨odinger equation
following from the one loop dilatation operator is
Eψ(l1, l2) =
 2r2
0 + r2
1 + r2
2

ψ(l1, l2) −r0r1 (ψ(l1 −1, l2) + ψ(l1 + 1, l2))
−r0r2(ψ(l1, l2 −1) + ψ(l1, l2 + 1))
(3.14)
The equation (3.14) is valid whenever the magnons are not adjacent in the string word, i.e.
when l2 > l1 + 1. If the magnons are adjacent, we ﬁnd
Eψ(l1, l1 + 1) =
 r2
1 + r2
2

ψ(l1, l1 + 1) −r0r1ψ(l1 −1, l1 + 1) −r0r2ψ(l1, l1 + 2) .
(3.15)
Make the following Bethe ansatz for the wave function
ψ(l1, l2) = eip1l1+ip2l2 + R12 eip′
1l1+ip′
2l2 .
(3.16)
It is straight forward to see that this ansatz obeys (3.14) as long as
E = 2r2
0 + r2
1 + r2
2 −r0r1(eip1 + e−ip1) −r0r2(eip2 + e−ip2)
(3.17)
and

.
(3.18)
Note that (3.17) is indeed the correct one loop anomalous dimension and (3.18) can be ob-
tained by equating the O(λ) terms in the equation expressing the conservation of magnon
energies. From (3.15) we can solve for the reﬂection coeﬃcient R12. The result is
R12 = −
2eip2 −r1
r0 eip1+ip2 −r2
r0
2eip′
2 −r1
r0 eip′
1+ip′
2 −r2
r0
(3.19)
This is a rather simple result. Two easy checks are
1. We see that R12R21 = 1.
2. If we set r1 = r2 = r0 = 1 we recover the S-matrix of [42]. If we set r0 = r2 = N and
keep r1 arbitrary, we recover the result of [12].

JHEP05(2018)198
To continue we need to go beyond the su(2) sector by considering a state with a
single Y impurity and a single X impurity.
The operator with a Y impurity at l1
(this is now magnon 1) and an X impurity at l2 (this is now magnon 2) is denoted
OB((l0)0, (l1, . . .)1, (l2, · · · )2, · · · )Y X and the operator with an X impurity at l1 (magnon 1)
and a Y impurity at l2 (magnon 2) is denoted OB((l0)0, (l1, . . .)1, (l2, · · · )2, · · · )XY . Intro-
duce the pair of wave functions
O =
X
l1,l2,···
[ψY X(l1, l2, · · · )OB((l0)0, (l1, . . .)1, (l2, · · · )2, · · · )Y X
+ψXY (l1, l2, · · · )OB((l0)0, (l1, . . .)1, (l2, · · · )2, · · · )XY ] .
(3.20)
We ﬁnd the time independent Schr¨odinger equation (3.14) for each wave function, when
the impurities are not adjacent. When the impurities are adjacent, we ﬁnd
EψAB(l1, l1 + 1) =
 r2
0 + r2
1 + r2


ψAB(l1, l1 + 1) −r0r1ψAB(l1 −1, l1 + 1)
−r2
0ψBA(l1, l1 + 1) −r0r2ψAB(l1, l1 + 2)
(3.21)
where A and B could be either X or Y . Make the following Bethe ansatz for the wave
function
ψY X(l1, l2) = eip1l1+ip2l2 + Aeip′
1l1+ip′
2l2
ψXY (l1, l2) = Beip′
1l1+ip′
2l2
(3.22)
The two equations of the form (3.14) imply that both ψXY (l1, l2) and ψY X(l1, l2) have the
same energy, which is given in (3.17). The equations (3.21) imply that
A =

(3.23)
These again have a nice simple dependence on c0, c1 and c2. One can check that |A|2 +
|B|2 = 1 which is a consequence of unitarity. To perform the check it is necessary to use
the conservation of momentum p1 +p2 = p′
1 +p′
2 and the constraint (3.18). We now obtain

where A12 and B12 are the exact S-matrix elements determined by the su(2|2)2 symmetry.

result. The ﬁrst order expression is

Two loops
We now consider scattering to two loops. A similar computation for the su(2) sector is
considered in [44] to determine the energy and the scattering element R12 to two loops.
At two loops R12 receives non-trivial contributions from the overall scattering phase. To
carry out a check independent of the unknown scattering phase, we again compare ratios
of S-matrix elements. We can carry this out in the su(2|3) sector of the theory. At two
loops fermionic terms contribute. The various interaction terms in the dilatation operator
up to two loops have been determined in [46]. For our study we begin by generalizing the
existing result by adjusting the weights of the various terms.
Our initial state consists of two types of impurities so that only the following terms in
the dilatation operator are relevant (we use the notation spelled out in [46])

where a, b and c are any of the bosonic scalar ﬁelds and α, β are any of the fermionic ﬁelds
of the su(2|3) sector. D0 is the classical dilatation operator, D2 a one loop contribution
and D4 a two loop contribution. The term D3 which is of order g3
Y M mixes operators with a
diﬀerent number of ﬁelds since it allows replacements of three boson ﬁelds with two fermion
ﬁelds and vice versa. Using the results developed in section 2 we can adjust the weights of
the various terms appearing in the dilatation operator, based on the local factors for the
magnons involved. These weights are spelled out in our Bethe ansatz equations below. We
set α1 =

N and α3 = 0. Factors of N are absorbed by replacing √ci →ri.
We use ψAB for a wave function with A and B bosonic excitations (A and B could be
either X or Y ) and ψab for a wave function with fermionic excitations. When the magnons

We now develop the string theory description of the gauge theory magnons. This probes
the strong coupling limit of the magnon dynamics. We will compute corrections to the
energy of magnons that carry ﬁnite angular momentum. As explained in the introduction,
these ﬁnite size corrections are not determined by the su(2|2)2 symmetry of the problem.
We study classical string solutions on the {t, r, φ} subspace of an LLM background

The giant magnon excitation of a string in the AdS5 × S5 background can be found as a
solution to the classical equations of motion [43]. Remarkably, the giant magnon
r(τ, σ) = c sec (φ(τ, σ) + t(τ, σ) + φ0)
(4.3)
also solves the equations of motion for any LLM geometry. Here c, φ0 are integration con-
stants ﬁxed by appropriate boundary conditions.2 It is convenient to choose the worldsheet
coordinates as φ = σ −τ and t = τ so that r = r(σ). The giant magnon maintains its
shape and is rotating at an angular velocity of 1.
To compute the ﬁnite size corrections we need to construct a ﬁnite angular momentum
magnon solution. The ﬁnite magnon [14] is a classical string solution that maintains its
shape but is rotating at an angular velocity less than 1. Our ansatz for the ﬁnite magnon is
r = r(κφ(τ, σ) + t(τ, σ)).
(4.4)
A convenient choice of worldsheet coordinates is φ = σ −τ and t = κτ so that again
r = r(σ). The equations of motion can be integrated to ﬁnd

with the right hand sides of these expressions evaluated on the classical solution. To evalu-
ate these integrals it is useful to make the coordinate transformation from σ to r using (4.5).
As an example, the expression for the conserved momentum simpliﬁes signiﬁcantly
p(κ, C) =

dσ = p1 + p2
where
pi =

(4.7)
where rmaxi are the endpoints of the string. These are any two roots of the denominator
of (4.5) and are thus functions of κ. It is useful to deﬁne the integral
Rpi =

Z rmaxi
C
r2
r′(σ)dr

(4.8)
The evaluation of (4.6) requires further changes of integration variables. Consider the case
rmaxi ≈ri so that when κ = 1 the magnon’s endpoint is at ri. In this case, the relevant
change of variables is

which can be veriﬁed at the level of the integrands. The derivative with respect to f can be
taken outside of the integrals since

z′(σ) vanishes at z = f. We thus only need the integrals
pi and Rpi to evaluate the conserved charges. For our problem of concentric rings, the edge
of the ring is at r = ri, where the function Vφ(r) has a pole. Consequently, we can make
the following substitution
Vφ(z) =

In summary, we have two integrals to evaluate, pi and Rpi. These integrals run from
f to 1 with an integrand also depending on f. In appendix B we develop a systematic
expansion of these integrals in powers of f.

which only receives a contribution from the local geometry of the magnon. This is expected
for a quantity associated to the local magnon excitation. Thus, the answer obtained (4.18)
is sensitive only to the local geometry the string experiences. Further, J0 −V computes the
number of ﬁelds in the dual CFT operator. It is clear from (4.17) that both the dispersion
relation for the giant magnon and its ﬁnite size eﬀects agree with the AdS5×S5 result after

Setting r1 = r2 = r0 we recover (4.17). Notice that the answer depends on J0 −V1 −V2.
This is again as it must be for a local quantity: J0 receives a contribution from all corners
while J0 −V1 −V2 receives contributions only from the corners where the magnon starts
and ends.

Dyonic giant magnons
The giant magnon solutions considered above are dual to single trace operators with o(1)
impurities. We now consider operators with J ﬁelds, of which J1 are Y -impurities, with J1
scaling as o(
√
N). These are dual to strings which have two conserved angular momentum
so that an additional angle participates when solving the equations of motion. We thus
consider the t, r, φ, θ subspace on the LLM plane

Finite size dyonic giant magnon
To go from the inﬁnite size dyonic giant magnon to the ﬁnite size version we again need to
adjust the angular velocity of the string endpoints. Make the ansatz
t = κτ
φ = σ −τ
r = r(σ)
θ = a(τ + f(r(σ)))
(4.32)
After some work we ﬁnd that the equations of motion are solved by
f ′(r(σ)) =
−r2(−1+κ)h4(r)+Vφ(r)(κ+(−1+κ)Vφ(r))


(κ+r(−1+κ)h2(r)+(−1+κ)Vφ(r))(−κ+r(−1+κ)h2(r)+(1−κ)Vφ(r))
.
When κ = 1 we recover the inﬁnite size solution and when a = 0 we recover the ﬁnite size
giant magnon solution. Recall that for the ﬁnite size giant magnon we need the points
where the denominator and numerator of r′(σ) vanishes. Here we choose the constants κ
and C1 so that the zeroes are at convenient values of r. The choice
κ = 1 −

min(r2
min(1 −κ)2h4(rmin) + (a + κ −(1 −κ)Vφ(rmin))(a −κ + (1 −κ)Vφ(rmin)))
yields a zero in the numerator at r = rmin and a zero in the denominator at r = rmax.
There is an additional zero in the numerator at r ≈rmax so that r′(σ) becomes imaginary
as we approach rmax. Our integration limits are thus the two zeroes in the numerator. We
will compute the location of the second zero explicitly in a small f expansion. In what

Once again these ﬁnite size corrections are related by a simple rescaling of the ’t Hooft
coupling, to the result obtained in [45], again exactly as predicted in [7]. In appendix C
results for dyonic giant magnons stretched between diﬀerent edges are given.

Conclusion
We have studied a subspace of the complete Hilbert space of N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory.
The subspace comprises small deformations of an LLM geometry [8] speciﬁed by a boundary
condition that is a set of black rings on the LLM plane. The operators corresponding
to an LLM background with a closed string excitation have a bare dimension of order
N2. The large N limit of correlators of these heavy operators receives contributions from
non-planar diagrams even for the leading large N dynamics. Thus, we are considering
a genuinely diﬀerent set up to the usual planar limit. The ﬂuctuations propagating on
this geometry are closed strings. When projected to the LLM plane, the closed strings
are polygons with all corners lying on the outer edge of a single ring.
Our interest in
these ﬂuctuations is because the weak coupling analysis of [7] shows that the net eﬀect
of summing the huge set of non-planar diagrams, is a simple rescaling of the ’t Hooft
coupling. This immediately predicts the anomalous dimensions of these operators in terms
of the corresponding dimensions computed in the planar limit and it implies that the
dynamics of this subsector is integrable.
We have carried out some highly nontrivial checks of the proposal of [7]. Using the
su(2|2)2 symmetry enjoyed by the subspace we consider we have determined the two
magnon S-matrix and have demonstrated that it agrees up to two loops with a weak
coupling computation performed in the CFT. We have also computed the ﬁrst ﬁnite size
corrections to both the magnon and the dyonic magnon. This was achieved by constructing
solutions to the Nambu-Goto action that carry ﬁnite angular momentum. These compu-
tations, which again show that the net aﬀect of the background is the scaling of the ’t
Hooft coupling predicted in [7] constitute a strong coupling check of our proposal. These
corrections are sensitive to the overall phase of the S-matrix which is not determined by
the su(2|2)2 symmetry of the theory, so this certainly appears to be a non-trivial test.
The enormous combinatoric complications of summing planar diagrams has been han-
dled using the representation theory methods that have been developed for heavy operators.
The ﬁnal answer is remarkably simple and it suggests that there may be many other large
N but non-planar subsectors of the theory that are worth exploring.
Perhaps the most signiﬁcant implication of our results is the existence of other inte-
grable sectors of N = 4 super Yang-Mills theory, besides the planar limit. This deserves
further exploration, since integrability gives us a window into the strong coupling dynamics
of these subsectors. It would be convincing if one could ﬁnd other signatures of integrabil-
ity, for example exact scattering soliton solutions of the classical string theory which would
be dual to magnon scattering. We leave these interesting questions for the future.

Finite size computations
In this section we outline the evaluation of the integrals needed to evaluate the ﬁnite size
correction. We will evaluate the integral
I =
Z 1
f
p
z2 −f2
√
1 −z2 F(z)dz
(B.1)
as a series expansion in f. It is suﬃcient to assume that F(z) is a positive function, ﬁnite
at z = f and z = 1. Both the integrand and the limits of the integral have f dependence.
To start, eliminate the f-dependence from the limits of integration. Write
I =

The second integrand can be expanded in powers of f to yield a series of convergent
integrals. The ﬁrst integral, on the other hand, leads to log divergent integrals. To capture
these divergences change variables as follows
I1 =
Z log( 1
f )
−∞
dyfey

p
1 −f2e2y F(fe2y) =
Z log( 1

(B.3)
Now perform a series expansion of the integrand
I1 =
Z log( 1
f )
−∞
dyfey
∞
X
i=1
˜F (i)(fey)i
(B.4)
and terminate the expansion at a given order
˜I(n)

f )
−∞
dyfey

i=1
˜F (i)(fey)i

The upper limit of the integral carries an f dependence.
To capture this dependence

Dyonic magnon solutions stretched between diﬀerent edges
Magnons stretched between diﬀerent edges lead to two integrals with diﬀerent limits. One
integral runs from r = rm to r = ri, while the second integral runs from r = rm to
r = rj. We can evaluate both integrals using the change of variables rm = rk
q
1 −˜C2
k.
The constant ˜C for the two integrals is diﬀerent. To compare the values of the integrals
we transform back to rm and rk
˜Ck =
s
1 −r2m
r2
k
.
(C.1)
The conserved charges are then sums of the form
p = pi(ri) + pj(rj)
(C.2)
which reduces to our previous expressions when rj = ri. Solving for the constants in terms
of conserved charges is involved but tractable. After simpliﬁcation we ﬁnd the following
