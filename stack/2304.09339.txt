Abstract
We analyse the effects of the ban of ChatGPT, a generative pre-trained transformer chatbot, on
individual productivity. We ﬁrst compile data on the hourly coding output of over 8,000 professional
GitHub users in Italy and other European countries to analyse the impact of the ban on individual
productivity. Combining the high-frequency data with the sudden announcement of the ban in
a difference-in-differences framework, we ﬁnd that the output of Italian developers decreased by
around 50% in the ﬁrst two business days after the ban and recovered after that. Applying a
synthetic control approach to daily Google search and Tor usage data shows that the ban led to a
signiﬁcant increase in the use of censorship bypassing tools. Our ﬁndings show that users swiftly
implement strategies to bypass Internet restrictions but this adaptation activity creates short-term
disruptions and hampers productivity.

Introduction
Unrestricted access to the Internet and digital technologies has become fundamental part of society
and is an important channel to enhance productivity in modern economies (Brynjolfsson and Hitt,
2000; Jorgenson, 2001; Stiroh, 2002; Hubbard, 2003; Agrawal et al., 2019). Unfortunately, governments
across the globe increasingly restrict access to the Internet and digital technologies. Partial or complete
shutdowns of a country’s Internet, the restricted access of particular website or the ban of digital
technologies is rampant. While government sanctioned Internet shutdowns and censorship is more
prevalent in autocratic regimes, some democratic governments also tend to restrict their citizen’s
access to the Internet by blocking access to particular websites or apps, often citing cybersecurity or
privacy concerns. These government interventions in the digital realm do not only inhibit people’s
access to information and their freedom to express opinions and ideas, but they also result in direct
economic costs. Business not only rely on the Internet for communication purposes, but increasingly
use web and cloud-based technologies as an input factor in their production function. A growing
number of AI technologies are hosted in the cloud (i.e. OpenAi) and restricting access to the Internet
also bars business from using it.
This paper provides an empirical analysis of the effects of Internet censorship on productivity. In
particular, we exploit the sudden announcement of a ban of ChatGPT, a, in Italy and analyse its
short-run effects of productivity of GitHub users. We ﬁnd that the ban of ChatGPT decreased output
of Italian GitHub users by around 50% in the ﬁrst two business days after the initiation of the
ban. Output levels returned to normal levels after that. We also interpret these ﬁndings as ﬁrst
evidence that ChatGPT is already actively used for high-skilled tasks in the economy. We further
show that Internet users in Italy adapted fairly quickly to the legislation by an increased use of VPN
and Tor tools to circumvent the ban. It is likely that the short-term drop in output is a result of
users’ adaptation behaviour and their time spent to circumvent the ban rather than on productive
activities. Overall, our ﬁndings reveal that potentially well intended restriction of Internet access,
for the purpose of protecting user data and privacy, has unintended, negative consequences on
productivity that are short-lived.
Our paper speaks to the large literature in economics and political science has emphasised on the
effects of Internet censorship on various societal outcomes as well as individual reaction to censorship.
Roberts (2018) documents how the Chinese Firewall adversely affects Internet speed in China while
Hobbs and Roberts (2018) shows how Chinese users react to the sudden ban of Instagram by an
increased used of circumvention tools. (Chen and Yang, 2019) conduct a ﬁeld experiment where
1

they randomly provide Chinese Internet users with access to censorship circumvention tools. They
ﬁnd that access to uncensored Internet in itself does not increase the demand for less censored
online information. However, in combination with a treatment that encourages the use of uncensored
Internet, and the associated consumption of less censored media leads to a change in the level of
information and political beliefs. In some cases, the blocking of particular websites is also used
to counter foreign propaganda and misinformation, such as the ban of the Russian social media
platform VKontakte in Ukraine (Golovchenko, 2022). We complement this literature by focusing on
censorship in a Western, democratic country and evaluating its effects on individual productivity of
knowledge workers.
We also contribute to the growing economic literature on the effects of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)
technology on productivity (Brynjolfsson et al., 2017; Agrawal et al., 2019). Similar to to time
savings through computerisation (Autor et al., 2003), AI technology has a large potential to impact
more complex and creative tasks. Brynjolfsson et al. (2017) argue that the full effects of AI on
productivity are difﬁcult to measure in aggregate, national statistics. Analysis at the micro level
could provide ﬁrst insights. Experimental evidence by Noy and Zhang (2023) is among the ﬁrst to
show how ChatGPT can increase output of knowledge workers. They conduct an incentivised, online
experiment where participants are asked to perform professional writing tasks. They randomly ask
half of the participants to sign up for ChatGPT and explain to them how it can be used to complement
their efforts for the latter set of writing tasks. They ﬁnd that the participants in the treatment group
take less time to ﬁnish their writing task, the quality of the written output is higher and use of
ChatGPT also increases the job satisfaction of the participants.
(Eloundou et al., 2023) examine the potential consequences of Generative Pre-trained Transformers
(GPTs) on the labor market in the United States, with a focus on the ampliﬁed abilities that arise from
LLM-powered software as opposed to LLMs alone. Their results indicate that the introduction of
LLMs could impact at least 10% of work tasks for about 80% of the US workforce, with roughly 19%
of workers potentially experiencing at least a 50% impact. These effects apply across all wage levels,
with higher-paying jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM-powered software. Access to an
LLM could result in a signiﬁcant decrease in the time required to complete approximately 15% of
all worker tasks in the US while maintaining the same level of quality. This percentage increases to
between 47 and 56% when incorporating software and tools developed on top of LLMs, suggesting
that LLM-powered software could have substantial economic implications.
Our study complements existing work by using a large set of secondary data on the output of
software and code developers. Recent studies by Kasheﬁand Mukerji (2023) Sobania et al. (2023) have
2

already highlighted the potential of Chatgpt to complement humans in programming in different
programming languages. Among other things, ChatGPT is used for debugging and improving
written codes by users, for completing missed parts of numerical codes, rewriting available codes in
other programming languages, and for parallelizing serial codes.
Our paper also relates to the large literature political (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006) religious
(Bénabou et al., 2021; Co¸sgel et al., 2012) or misaligned incentives within a sector or ﬁrm (Desmet
and Parente, 2014; Atkin et al., 2017) lead to resistance against the adoption and diffusion of new
technological innovations; by workers whose share of income was reduced due the the arrival of new
labour-saving technologies (Caprettini and Voth, 2020).
The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides some background information about ChatGPT
and the Ban of the technology in Italy; Section 3 describes the data; Section 4 and 5 present empirical
results on the effect of the ban on productivity and and adapation behaviour, respectively; Section 5
concludes.

ChatGPT and its Ban Italy
ChatGPT, is a large language models (LLM), which was created by US start-up OpenAI, has been
used by millions of people since it launched in November 2022. It is a large-scale artiﬁcial intelligence
(AI) language model that uses a transformer-based neural network to process natural language.
ChatGPT has been trained on a vast corpus of online text data from the Internet as it was in 2021.
During the training process, the model learned to identify patterns and relationships between words,
phrases, and sentences, enabling it to generate text.1
ChatGPT is accessible via a public website (chatgpt.openai.com) or an API and almost everyone2 can
sign up for a free account. The interface is designed like a chat environment where the user writes
“prompts” and ChatGPT answers. Interactions can range from casual chats, to search like queries, but
also more complex interactions such as creative writing of a text based on a prompt, the creation of
recipes. ChatGPT also has the capabilities to write code in multiple programming languages based
on a simply prompt.
On April 1st 2023, the Italian data protection authority (Garante per la protezione dei dati personali)
has blocked the use of the ChatGPT chatbot, citing privacy concerns. The Italian watchdog has
announced an investigation into OpenAI’s compliance with General Data Protection Regulation
1Such as this very paragraph.
2Prior to Italy, ChatGpt was already banned in countries like China, Russia or North Korea
3

(GDPR). In particular authority has said that there was no legal basis to justify the mass collection
and storage of personal data for the purpose of training algorithms underlying the operation of the
platform.3
A priori it is unclear how the ban might affect individual productivity. As shown by recent papers,
ChatGPT can enhance productivity of coding (Kasheﬁand Mukerji, 2023; Sobania et al., 2023) and
professional writing tasks (Noy and Zhang, 2023). Therefore, the sudden ban can have negative
effects on individual productivity. However, ChatGPT is still a fairly young technology and there is
no reliable data available on its diffusion within the economy. The media hype around the technology
might paint a misleading picture of the adoption by companies and individual knowledge workers.
As such, the ban might not have any systematic impact on individual productivity. It is also possible,
that

Data
3.1
GitHub Data
We access individual, real-time activity data from GitHub users in Italy (treatment), Austria and
France (control) in the weeks prior and immediately after the ChatGPT ban in Italy, March 27th –
April 11th 2023.
GitHub is the world’s largest online code hosting platform, used for storing and jointly working on
coding projects, so called repositories. All modiﬁcations to the GitHub repository are automatically
timestamped and stored, and GitHub permits the tracking of any iterations to speciﬁc ﬁles and lines
of code. The history of iterations and actions is available for anybody with access to a repository to
examine and download. Every action taken by a team member is automatically recorded, keeping
details about the kind and substance of the modiﬁcation, the ﬁles and code lines affected, and the
date those changes were performed. With GitHub’s history of developing open-source software, a
signiﬁcant portion of the repositories are not access restricted, meaning that the information about
projects’ activity is available to everyone. As such, public GitHub repositories provide a direct,
real-time measurement of labor activity of software and code developers for millions of software and
code developers worldwide (McDermott and Hansen, 2021).
GitHub data has already been used in empirical research to study changes in software developers’
productivity during the onset of COVID19 (Forsgren, 2021), how COVID19 changed the daily and

weekly patterns of labour allocation of individuals (McDermott and Hansen, 2021); the impact of the
effects of working from home on individuals’ productivity (Shen, 2023), the effect of air pollution on
individual output (Holub and Thies, 2023), or analyse the relationship between social links and the
likelihood of joining professional software development teams(Casalnuovo et al., 2015).
Our preferred measure for GitHub users’ output are Release events. A release is a deployable version
of a software project that make it available for a wider audience and easy for users to download and
install the software. It typically includes a set of release notes, documentation, and binaries or source
code.4. On an hourly and daily basis, releases are relatively rare events and we create an indicator
variable that switches to one if the user has recorded at least one release event during the respective
time period (hour or day).
We also use the (log of) number of total GitHub events by a user, Events, the sum of Push and Pull
events, PushPull and an aggregate Output measure based on Holub and Thies (2023), which is the
sum of Push, Pull Requests, Pull Request Comments, Commit Comments, Create, and Issues. In
addition, we use information about the users organisational afﬁliation to distinguish between GitHub
users who have entered an organisational afﬁliation (i.e. company, research organisation) and those
without an organisational afﬁliation.
We access data on individual GitHub user’s activity from and GitHub Archive which is updated daily
and contains all public event data. GitHub Archive data is hosted on Google’s BigQuery warehouse
system and can be accessed with a query on google’s cloud infrastructure. GitHub user information
was downloaded using the GitHub GraphQL API 5. Both datasets are then joined via the unique
GitHub user login.
Descriptive statistics and a balance test for the GitHub data is presented in Table A.1 in the appendix.
3.2
Google Trends and Tor
To examine how Italian ChatGPT users adapt after the ban, we collect daily data from two sources
Google Trends and Tor Metrics for all 25 countries in the European Union.
Google trends data
has already been widely used in economic research as a predictor of human behaviour economic
phenomena (Choi and Varian, 2012). For example Böhme et al. (2020) have used Google trends data
migration-related google search terms to predict international migration while Ginsberg et al. (2009)
have used this data to predict inﬂuenza outbreaks.
4See https://docs.GitHub.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-GitHub/about-releases
5The python scripts that was written to access the GitHub user information for the respective countries is available at
https://GitHub.com/sodalabsio/GitHub_scrape

We focus on the period after the release of ChatGPT-4 on 13 March 2023 until the end of the work
week after the ban on 7 April 2023. Since we are interested in the effect of the ban on output,
observations on weekends are dropped from the sample. Figure B.2 in the Appendix provides a
graphic illustration of the ﬁnal panel structure.
We construct three outcome measures. First, we obtain the number of Google searches on the topic
of “Virtual Private Networks”. Google normalizes the number of searches by the total number of
searches in the selected country and period and our outcome measure, therefore, is bounded between
0 and 1. Second, we download information on the number of users of Tor, an open-source software
for enabling anonymous communication. In particular, we collect the number of users of “standard”
Tor relays, and of Tor bridge relays. The latter are not listed publicly and, therefore, more difﬁcult to
identify for ﬁrewalls but can slow down the connection.6 We apply a log transformation to both user
numbers.

The Effect of the Ban on Productivity
To analyse the effect of the Italian ChatGPT ban on output by GitHub users, we estimate variants of
the following Difference-in-Difference (DID) event study model:
Yit =αi + λt +
−1
∑
τ=−3
βτDτ
it +
4
∑
τ=0
βτDτ
it + ϵit,
(1)
where Yit is an indicator variable that equaling to one if user i made a Release on GitHub on day
t and zero otherwise. D is a dummy variable, switching to one for observation’s in the treatment
group is in period τ and zero otherwise. αi is a vector of user speciﬁc ﬁxed effects, λt are day (date)
ﬁxed effects, β are the parameters of interest and ϵit is the error term. Standard errors are clustered
at the GitHub user-level.
The results are presented in Figure 1 showing a statistically signiﬁcant drop in release likelihood in
the two ﬁrst business days after the ChatGPT ban was initiated.
We then proceed and estimate a difference-in-differences speciﬁcation that combines the Pre and Post
period. The results are presented in Table 1. In the ﬁrst speciﬁcation in panel A, we specify the pre
period as the last Monday and Tuesday (March 27th and 28th 2023) prior to the ban and the post
period as the ﬁrst Monday and Tuesday (April 3rd and 4th 2023) after the implementation of the ban.

Figure 1: The Effect of the ChatGpt ban on GitHub Releases
Notes: Black dots represent the coefﬁcients from estimating the difference-in-Difference (DID) event study
model from equation 1. 95% conﬁdence intervals using robust standard errors clustered on the GitHub user-
level are depicted. The horizontal axis label denotes the days before and after the ChatGPT ban was imple-
mented. The last day prior to the ban, 31/03/23 is the left out period. The weekend days (01/02.04) after the
ban was implemented are not included.
Columns 1–4 present estimates for the sample of users with organisational afﬁliation, while columns
5–8 are the estimates for users without afﬁliation. Starting with the sample of GitHub users with an
organisational afﬁliation, we ﬁnd no systematic effect on the ChatGPT ban on the total number of
GitHub events. However, we ﬁnd a a statistically signiﬁcant and negative effect on the likelihood of
Release events. Considering the mean of Release in the sample of 0.024, the point translates into an
approx. 50% reduction in the likelihood that a developer will have a release event recorded on GitHub
in the ﬁrst two business days after the ban. The estimated coefﬁcients for Output and PushPull also
have a negative sign but are not statistically signiﬁcant. We do not ﬁnd any systematic effects of the
ban on activity by GitHub users without an organisational afﬁliation. Panel B contains results where
the post period consists of the next three business days after the ban, Thursday, Friday (April 5th and
6th)7 as well as Monday (April 11th). None of the estimated coefﬁcients of Treat × Post is statistically
signiﬁcant and the coefﬁcients also have a lower magnitude compared to the results in panel A. This
suggests that the disruptions caused by the ban was relatively short-lived and Italian GitHub users
quickly recovered their pre-ban levels of productivity.
Table 2 presents the results of a heterogeneity analysis using the sample of users with an organisational
afﬁliation. The results reveal that the adverse effects of the ban on productivity are mainly driven

In Table A.2 we report the result of a placebo test. While ChatGPT can have effects on GitHub
events that require some productive activities, the writing and debugging of code is a pre-requisite
for a stable Release, for other GitHub activities such as Gollum, Member or Public there is no use
for ChatGPT. For those type of activities we would not expect an systematic impact of the ban of
8

ChatGPT. The result in Table A.2 show that the implementation has basically a null effect on those
activities.
In Figure B.1 we compare the average, hourly release likelihood between Italian GitHub users and
GitHub users from the control countries over the period March 27th to April 6th in UTC time8.
The ﬁrst row (panels a–d) contains plots for the Monday to Thursday prior to the implementation
of the ban; the second row contains plots for the Monday to Thursday in the ﬁrst week after the
implementation of the ban; and the third row contains a plot for Friday, March 31st when the
ban was announced, Saturday April 1st, when the ban started and Sunday, April 1st, which was
the ﬁrst(second) weekend day the ban was in place. The red line are the average, hourly release
likelihood values for the Italian users, and the blue one are the ones for the control countries. In most
of the weekdays plots (a–i) one can see the intradiurnal patterns of a typical workday. Output is
relatively low in the early morning and starts to increase at around 8:00 and then dropping again after
18:00–20:00 local time. On the business days prior to the introduction of the ban (panels a–d), output
of Italian and control users was vary similar during the day. There was also no difference in GitHub
release patterns on the day the ban was announced, Friday March 31st (panel i) as well as on the
following Saturday and Sunday (panels j–k). Output on those two days was also comparatively low.
One interpretation is that on those days mainly users who do not rely on ChatGPT for their coding
work are active or users would mainly work from home on the weekend where users have already set
up (or it is easier to set up) a private VPN or Tor connection to circumvent the ban. In addition, our
results also provide ﬁrst indicative evidence that ChatGPT, despite being only a few months old and
still considered to be in beta version, is already systematically used to support software and coding
activities.

Adaption to the ChatGPT Ban
Considering the relatively quick recovery of individual productivity after the implementation of
the ChatGPT ban, we now turn our attention towards adaptation behaviour. The simplest way to
circumvent the ChatGPT ban is the use of VPN tools or encrypted routing through the Tor network.
We conduct our analysis at the country-workday level. To estimate the average treatment effect of the
Chat GPT ban on users from Italy, we apply the generalized synthetic control method proposed by
Xu (2017). The treatment effect on the treated unit (ATT) is the difference between the actual outcome
and its estimated counterfactual. To obtain the counterfactual, a (cross-validated) interactive ﬁxed

9

effects (IFE) model is estimated for the control group data.9 All IFE models incorporate additive unit
and time ﬁxed effects.10 To draw inference, we rely on the parametric bootstrap procedure suggested
by Xu (2017) in settings with a small number of treated units.
Figure 2 presents the effect of the ChatGPT ban on the number of Google queries on the topic of VPNs.
We observe a signiﬁcant increase in the share of web searches relative to other topics in Italy on the
ﬁrst working day after the ban that slowly vanishes over the next three days. The estimated effect on
April 3rd is sizeable: the share of searches on VPNs increases by 52.2 percentage points. On average,
the share of queries on VPNs was 20.6 percentage points higher in Italy over the workweek. The
observed pattern is consistent with Italian users looking for ways to access ChatGPT even after the
ban and succeeding after some initial search costs. Our estimates might, however, present only stated
preferences.
Figure 2: The Effect of the ChatGPT ban on Google Search of VPN
Notes: The dynamic treatment effects estimates for the generalized synthetic control method of Xu (2017) are
depicted. The counterfactual for the treated unit (Italy) is estimated using an interactive ﬁxed effects model.
95% conﬁdence intervals using the parametric bootstrap procedure proposed by Xu (2017) are displayed. Ad-
ditionally, the average ATT over the workweek after the ChatGPT ban and its p-value (in parentheses) are
presented.
To investigate if the ban actually lead to behavioral changes of Italian users, we look at an alternative
outcome: the log number of Tor users. The results for Tor relay (top panel) and Tor bridge users (bottom
panel) are presented in Figure 3. While the number of Tor relay users only shows a minor increase
in the days after the ban, the average treatment effect on the number of Italian Tor bridge users is
positive and signiﬁcant on the ﬁrst working day after ban. The usage of Tor bridges remains elevated
9In speciﬁc, we apply the EM algorithm proposed by Gobillon and Magnac (2016) and implemented in the R package
gsynth (Xu and Liu, 2022), which additionally uses treatment group information for the pre-treatment period, leading to
(slightly) more precisely estimated coefﬁcients.
10Note that the Google trends data is already standardized by country for the selected time period. Hence, the estimated
IFE model in this case only incorporates time ﬁxed effects.
10

for the entire workweek, with an increase in user numbers–on average–of about 9.4 percentage points.
This pattern is in line with users resorting to bridge over “standard” relays to minimize the chance of
being denied access from ChatGPT, since the former are more difﬁcult to identify by ﬁrewalls.11

depicted. The top panel presents the average treatment effect on the log number of “standard” Tor relay users
in Italy. The bottom panel presents the ATT for Tor bridge relay users. The counterfactual for the treated unit
(Italy) is estimated using an interactive ﬁxed effects model. 95% conﬁdence intervals using the parametric
bootstrap procedure proposed by Xu (2017) are displayed. Additionally, the average ATT over the workweek
after the ChatGPT ban and its p-value (in parentheses) are presented.
Overall, our ﬁndings provide support for the notion that the sizable but short-lived decline in output
after the ban is the result of Italian users looking for and successfully ﬁnding ways of circumventing
the blocked access to ChatGPT.

Conclusion
We study the consequences of the ban of ChatGPT, a web-based, generative AI technology, in Italy.
We compile high-frequency data on GitHub activity from over 8,000 users in Italy and other European
countries to measure individual level output of software and code developers. We show that the
sudden ban of ChatGPT decreased output by Italian users of around 50% in the ﬁrst two days after
the ban. We do not ﬁnd any effects on output after that. This pattern is likely driven by Italian users’
efforts to bypass the ban. Using Google search trend and Tor data in a synthetic control design we
ﬁnd that searches for VPN increases by around 52 percentage points in the days after the ban while
the usage of Tor bridges increases by 9.4 percentage points.
Our ﬁndings indicate that government-mandated blocking of digital technology can have adverse
effects on the economy. While these measures may be well-intented, they are often ineffective and
can lead to short-term disruptions in output. Sudden bans can be easily circumvented with VPN
tools, but these adjustment activities simultaneously distort production processes and negatively
impact productivity in professions that rely on the banned technology. This can ultimately lead to
short-run disruptions in economic output. Overall, our research highlights the need for policymakers
to consider the potential economic cost of digital technology bans before imposing them.
