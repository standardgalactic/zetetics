Abstract: We propose and study a BCJ double-copy of massive particles, showing that
it is equivalent to a KLT formula with a kernel given by the inverse of a matrix of mas-
sive bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes. For models with a uniform non-zero mass spectrum we
demonstrate that the resulting double-copy factors on physical poles and that up to at least
5-particle scattering, color-kinematics satisfying numerators always exist. For the scatter-
ing of 5 or more particles, the procedure generically introduces spurious singularities that
must be cancelled by imposing additional constraints. When massive particles are present,
color-kinematics duality is not enough to guarantee a physical double-copy. As an example,
we apply the formalism to massive Yang-Mills and show that up to 4-particle scattering
the double-copy construction generates physical amplitudes of a model of dRGT massive
gravity coupled to a dilaton and a two-form with dilaton parity violating couplings. We
show that the spurious singularities in the 5-particle double-copy do not cancel in this ex-
ample, and the construction fails to generate physically sensible amplitudes. We conjecture
suﬃcient constraints on the mass spectrum, which in addition to massive BCJ relations,
guarantee the absence of spurious singularities.

Introduction
The essence of the double-copy is the existence (or conjectured existence) of a map from
the physical observables O of a pair of models A and B, each with a non-Abelian internal
symmetry structure, to physical observables in some other model A ⊗B, without such a
symmetry
OA × OB 7→OA⊗B.
(1.1)
The original and best-studied example of such a map is given by the construction of Kawai-
Lewellen-Tye (KLT), relating tree-level open and closed string scattering amplitudes [1],
and the associated ﬁeld theory limit (α′ →0) relating Yang-Mills and Einstein gravity. For
example at 4-point

(1.2)
The double-copy has subsequently been extended to a surprisingly eclectic class of ﬁeld
theory models including non-linear sigma models and D-brane worldvolume EFTs [2], gen-
eralized to loop-level [3] and even extended to classes of classical solutions [4].
See [5]
and references therein for a comprehensive review of recent developments. More than a
theoretical curiosity, there are often signiﬁcant practical advantages to making use of such
a map whenever it is available. Recent use of a generalized double-copy construction for
Feynman integrands in N = 8 supergravity allowed the ﬁrst explicit calculation of 4-point,
5-loop scattering amplitudes [6], a feat that is practically impossible to replicate by other,
presently available means.
It is therefore a timely and relevant theoretical problem to understand the potential scope
for generalizing the double-copy, and demarcating the boundary between those models
which admit a double-copy structure and those which do not. In this paper we will be
concerned with the problem of generalizing the ﬁeld theory double-copy relation for tree-
level scattering amplitudes to models with generic massive spectra. Our central result is
the demonstration that when massive particles are present, color-kinematics duality is not
enough to guarantee a physically well-deﬁned double-copy. We present in detail an explicit
example, massive Yang-Mills, for which color-kinematics duality satisfying numerators exist
(up to at least n = 5), but for which the BCJ double-copy prescription generates expressions
with non-physical spurious singularities.
The well-known construction of Bern, Carrasco and Johansson (BCJ) [7] begins by orga-
nizing tree-level scattering amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills as a sum over trivalent graphs1

.
(1.3)
This form of the amplitude reveals the remarkable, hidden property of color-kinematics
1We will use the following convention c12 = f a1a2bf a3a4b, c13 = f a1a3bf a4a2b and c14 = f a1a4bf a2a3b.
We also use Mandelstam invariants with all outgoing momenta, i.e. sij = (pi + pj)2.

duality, the BCJ numerators satisfy a sum rule
n12 + n13 + n14 = 0,
(1.4)
mirroring the Jacobi relation of the color factors
c12 + c13 + c14 = 0.
(1.5)
Perhaps even more remarkably, making the replacement ci →ni gives an expression

(1.6)
which has all of the formal properties (gauge invariance, unitarity, locality) of a scattering
amplitude in a model of Einstein gravity coupled to a massless dilaton and Kalb-Ramond
two-form.
The fundamental result of BCJ was to prove this BCJ double-copy and the
property of color-kinematics duality persist at all multiplicity.
An important point to emphasize is that even though the BCJ numerators are non-unique,
since the amplitude (1.3) is unchanged by a generalized gauge transformation
n12 →n12 + s12∆,
n13 →n13 + s13∆,
n14 →n14 + s14∆,
(1.7)
where ∆is an arbitrary function, this freedom is insuﬃcient in general to ﬁnd a BCJ
representation satisfying color-kinematics duality. Due to the kinematic identity s12 +s13 +
s14 = 0, the value of the Jacobi sum of numerators n12 + n13 + n14 is also invariant. If the
kinematic Jacobi relation is violated in one generalized gauge, it will be violated in every
generalized gauge. The existence of color-kinematics duality satisfying numerators is then
a very special property which is obtained only in Yang-Mills and a handful of other models
[5].
While beautifully simple, it is not at all obvious that the expression (1.6) resulting from the
BCJ construction is a physical scattering amplitude. In particular, this construction fails
to manifest locality in the form of the absence of spurious, non-propagator-like, singularities
and the factorization of amplitudes on propagator-like, physical singularities. For n ≥5 the
generalized gauge functions needed to bring the local form of BCJ numerators generated by
Feynman rules, to a color-kinematics duality satisfying representation, can in principle be
arbitrarily complicated. The simplest way to show the absence of spurious singularities in
the BCJ construction is to prove that it is equivalent to the KLT construction which, after
making a convenient choice of basis, can be written in a form that manifests the absence of
spurious singularities [7].
The BCJ construction has a natural extension to models containing massive states, for
which various special cases have been considered previously [8–18].
To our knowledge,
no completely general description of a massive BCJ double-copy, and the associated con-
straints, has been given. In particular, the case of double-copying amplitudes in theories
– 3 –

with no massless particles has not been studied before. This paper is a ﬁrst step towards
such a description. The direct analogue of the BCJ form of the amplitude for models with
a uniform, non-zero mass spectrum is2

(1.8)
To construct the massive double-copy of such a model, we will follow closely the discussion
above, and try to construct numerators which satisfy the kinematic Jacobi relation n12 +
n13 + n14 = 0. If we succeed, we make the replacement ci →ni and construct the would-be

(1.9)
The central problem in this paper will be to understand the conditions under which ex-
pressions such as (1.9) and its natural generalization to higher multiplicity, deﬁne physical
scattering amplitudes. At this point we make a simple observation, the massive analogue
of a generalized gauge transformation
n12 →n12 +(s12 +m2)∆,
n13 →n13 +(s13 +m2)∆,
n14 →n14 +(s14 +m2)∆, (1.10)
which leaves (1.8) invariant, does not leave the sum of numerators invariant, rather
n12 + n13 + n14 →n12 + n13 + n14 −m2∆.
(1.11)
It follows that, when m ̸= 0, we can always ﬁnd a generalized gauge that realizes color-
kinematics duality! Since this argument relied only on knowledge of the spectrum, it applies
to all models with uniform non-zero mass spectra, independent of the details of the inter-
actions. Contrary to the m = 0 case where color-kinematics duality was a special property
only found in a handful of models, for models with generic massive spectra it is no con-
straint at all. As we will see, this situation is indeed too good to be true. By rewriting
the resulting would-be double-copy in a KLT-like form with a kernel given by the inverse
of a matrix of massive bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes [19, 20], we ﬁnd that the double-copy
generically introduces non-local, spurious singularities for n > 4, and fails to reduce to the
standard double-copy as m →0.
As a theoretical laboratory for making explicit calculations, we consider the physically well-
motivated example of a model of massive Yang-Mills. As we explain in detail in Section
3.1, by considering the reduction to the familiar massless double-copy in the high-energy
or Goldstone boson equivalence limit, there is a plausible expectation that massive Yang-
Mills double copies to a model of de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley or dRGT massive gravity
[21] coupled to a massive dilaton and a massive two-form. The primary conclusion of this
example is that no miraculous cancellation of the spurious singularities takes place, and the
proposed massive double-copy fails to generate physical scattering amplitudes for n > 4. We
2Throughout this paper we will use the mostly-plus metric convention ηµν = diag (−1, +1, +1, +1).
– 4 –

will conclude by revisiting the logic of the above argument in Section 4 and demonstrate
that if, in addition to color-kinematics duality, the spectrum of masses satisﬁes certain
constraints, then a local massive double-copy does indeed exist.
An outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we show that the massive BCJ double-
copy can be equivalently formulated as a KLT-like product with a kernel given by the inverse
of a (n −2)! × (n −2)! matrix of massive bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes. Here we use the Del
Duca-Dixon-Maltoni (DDM) basis [22]. The KLT product is shown to factor into lower-
point amplitudes on physical poles at all multiplicities, but generically does not smoothly
reduce to the massless KLT product as m →0. Additionally, for n ≥5 the massive kernel
contains spurious singularities that cannot be associated with a factorization channel for
any physical state. In Section 3 we present our primary explicit example, the double-copy
of a mass-deformed version of Yang-Mills. At n = 3 and n = 4, the double-copy gives
physically sensible results that can be interpreted as scattering amplitudes of a model of
dRGT massive gravity coupled to a dilaton and two-form with a Λ3 cutoﬀscale. At n = 5,
we numerically evaluate the residue on the spurious singularities, and conﬁrm that they are
non-zero, demonstrating that the BCJ double-copy does not produce a physical scattering
amplitude. In Section 4 we consider models with a general spectrum of masses. We show
that if a certain condition is imposed on the spectrum, then the rank of the bi-adjoint
scalar matrix is reduced and implies massive versions of the fundamental BCJ relations.
It is shown that if the rank is reduced to (n −3)! then the massive double-copy takes a
manifestly local form which reduces smoothly to the massless double-copy. In Section 5 we
conclude and describe important future directions.
While this work was in its ﬁnal stages, the preprint [23] by Momeni, Rumbutis and Tolley
appeared with some overlapping results at 4-point level.

Massive KLT Formula
Models with on-shell U(N) symmetry, with asymptotic states in the adjoint representa-
tion, admit a convenient decomposition of tree-amplitudes into single trace or color-ordered
partial amplitudes of the form
An (1a1, ..., nan) =
X
σ∈Sn−1
Tr [T a1T aσ(2)...T aσ(n)] An [1 σ(2)...σ(n)] .
(2.1)
For such models, the BCJ double-copy is formally equivalent to the ﬁeld theory limit of the
KLT relations

where the sum is taken over (possibly distinct) BCJ bases of size (n−3)!, and S is a function
of Mandelstam invariants called the KLT kernel. An explicit all-multiplicity expression for
– 5 –

the massless KLT kernel, in a particularly convenient choice of BCJ basis, is given in eq.
(2.51) of [5].
In Section 1, we saw a proposed extension of the BCJ double-copy to models with uniform,
non-zero mass spectra. In this section, by following the same well-known formal manip-
ulations as the massless case, we will derive an equivalent massive KLT formula. Let us
begin by illustrating the argument explicitly at 4-point. We consider two, possibly distinct
models A and B with on-shell U(N) symmetry and uniform mass spectra, which admit
a BCJ representation (1.8). If we can ﬁnd a generalized gauge for which the numerators
satisfy the kinematic Jacobi relations
nA
12 + nA
13 + nA
14 = 0,
nB
12 + nB
13 + nB
14 = 0,
(2.3)
then the proposed massive BCJ double-copy takes the form

nA
14nB
14
s14 + m2 .
(2.4)
As mentioned in Section 1, for a model with this mass spectrum a set of kinematic Jacobi-
satisfying numerators can always be found.
Consider for example a set of numerators,
perhaps generated from Feynman rules, that do not satisfy the kinematic Jacobi relations,
n12 + n13 + n14 = E ̸= 0.
(2.5)
We can always perform the following generalized gauge transformation,
n12 →n12 + 1
m2 (s12 + m2)E
n13 →n13 + 1
m2 (s13 + m2)E
n14 →n14 + 1
m2 (s14 + m2)E,
(2.6)
to generate a set of numerators satisfying (2.3).
It is useful to rephrase this argument in a way that makes natural the extension to all-
multiplicity. We begin with the important observation that the number of linearly indepen-
dent numerators, after imposing kinematic Jacobi identities, is (n−2)! which is exactly the
number of amplitudes in a DDM basis [22]. By decomposing the color-factors in the BCJ
representation into single-trace components, the color-ordered partial amplitudes (2.3) can
be expressed as linear functions of the numerators, for example
A4[1234] =
n12
s12 + m2 −
n14
s14 + m2 .
(2.7)
For a model admitting both a BCJ representation (1.3) and a single-trace decomposition
(2.1), the (n −1)! non-cyclically related partial amplitudes cannot be linearly independent.
Indeed, by reducing to a DDM basis of color-structures [22], the number of independent
– 6 –

partial amplitudes is found to be (n −2)! with the non-trivial linear relations among the
original (n−1)! basis given by the so-called Kleiss-Kuijf (KK) relations [24]. This counting
leads us to the conclusion that there are an equal number of independent partial amplitudes
and kinematic numerators, which are linearly related by equations of the form

When m = 0 however, the propagator matrix has rank 1, and no such inversion is possible.

for any function ∆. We recognize this is as the statement that generalized gauge invariance
(1.7) preserves the kinematic Jacobi relations (2.3). We can use this residual freedom to
impose the gauge-ﬁxing conditions ˆn13 = 0, and solve for ˆn12. From (2.8) with m = 0,
we have two diﬀerent expressions for ˆn12 which must be equal, leading to the so-called
fundamental BCJ identity
s12A4 [1234] = s13A4[1324].
(2.11)
We can run this argument in both directions, reaching the well-known conclusion that
the fundamental BCJ relations are necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the existence of
color-kinematics duality satisfying BCJ numerators.
This analysis generalizes naturally to n-point. For a model with uniform mass spectrum
and m ̸= 0 there is a linear relation of the form (2.8) relating the (n −2)! DDM bases of
partial amplitudes and the kinematic numerators with an (n −2)! × (n −2)! propagator
matrix. We believe that this matrix is always of full-rank, but do not have a proof of this
fact. An explicit expression for the 6 × 6 massive propagator matrix at n = 5 is given in
Appendix A, from which the rank can be veriﬁed to be 6.
If the matrix is full-rank, then we can solve for a unique set of color-kinematics duality
satisfying numerators by inverting the linear relation. Furthermore, since a full-rank prop-
agator matrix has no null vectors, there are no additional BCJ-like relations among the
partial amplitudes and hence no constraints on which models can admit a massive BCJ
double-copy. As we will discuss further in Section 4, these conclusions may be modiﬁed in
models with a more complicated spectrum of masses.
Once we have solved for the numerators, it is straightforward to rewrite the BCJ double-

copy in KLT form (2.2). We ﬁrst rewrite the BCJ double-copy (2.4) in matrix form

which is of KLT form, with the matrix in the middle acting as a massive KLT kernel.
A similar calculation can be performed at 5-point, both to calculate the 6 numerators from a
DDM basis of 6 amplitudes and to calculate the KLT kernel. The details of this calculation
are presented in Appendix A.
2.1
Massive KLT Kernel
Somewhat recently the massless KLT kernel was understood to be the inverse of a matrix
of bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes [19, 20]. Previously, we saw how to construct a KLT kernel
from a massive BCJ double-copy. In this section we recognize this kernel as the inverse of
a matrix of massive bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes, giving us a general prescription for an
n-point massive KLT formula.
We begin by reviewing the construction in the massless case. The scattering amplitudes of
the following U(N)×U( ˜N) invariant model of massless scalars transforming in the bi-adjoint

The partial amplitudes Aφ3
n [α|β] are indexed by two orderings and can be constructed
eﬃciently via a simple diagrammatic procedure [20]. Regarding Aφ3[α|β] as an (n −1)! ×
(n −1)! matrix, it can be shown to have rank (n −3)! [19]. The null vectors correspond to
separate row and column KK and BCJ relations. For example at 4-point
s12Aφ3
4 [1234|1234] = s13Aφ3
4 [1324|1234].
(2.16)
The central result of [19] was to prove that a BCJ-independent (n−3)!×(n−3)! sub-matrix

has full-rank, and moreover has an inverse which is precisely equal to the KLT kernel in

Amplitudes in the massive theory are constructed using the same diagrammatic rules used
for the massless theory [20], but with the massless propagators replaced with their massive
counterparts. For example,

The 5-point matrix of bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes can be found in Appendix A. The primary
diﬀerence between the massless and massive bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes is in the number
of independent color-orderings. In the massive theory, DDM orderings are independent and
the (n−2)!×(n−2)! matrix of bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes has full-rank. Since this matrix
is invertible, there is a natural conjecture for a massive KLT formula. At 4-point this takes
the explicit form

The coeﬃcient of the leading O(m−2) term is recognizable as a product of fundamental
BCJ relations. Thus, we see that the formula admits a smooth massless limit only when
the fundamental BCJ relation is satisﬁed either by theory A or B in their massless limits.
For a pair of massive deformations of BCJ-compatible theories, the massive KLT formula
then reduces to the familiar massless KLT relation,
AA⊗B
4
(1, 2, 3, 4) = −s14AA[1234]AB[1324] + O(m2) .
(2.24)
We now proceed to 5-point, where the explicit comparison of KLT and BCJ forms of the
double-copy can be repeated using the results of Appendix A to ﬁnd that, again, the KLT
kernel from the massive BCJ double-copy is precisely the inverse of massive bi-adjoint scalar
amplitudes.
For general n, we propose the following massive KLT formula

n [α|β] is a matrix of
amplitudes of massive bi-adjoint scalar theory. We have shown explicitly that up to n = 5
this agrees with the massive BCJ double-copy and conjecture that they agree at all n.
2.2
Factorization on Physical Poles
An essential property of amplitudes in local theories is the presence of simple poles when
intermediate momenta go on-shell and factorization of the amplitude into products of lower-
point amplitudes in the associated residue.
In this section, we will discuss how these
properties are ensured in amplitudes generated by our proposed massive KLT formula
(2.25). We will focus on factorization of (2.25) on two-particle channels and relegate the
discussion of multi-particle channels to Appendix B.
We begin by assuming that theories A and B are local and that their amplitudes factorize
correctly on two-particle channels,

 (s12 + m2)0
,
(2.26)
where there is an implicit sum over states on the right-hand-side.
Next without loss of generality, let us choose to study factorization on the s12 pole. We
can further assume that we have chosen a DDM basis in which the ﬁrst m elements have
the form [12σ(3, · · · , n)] where σ is a permutation, and no other elements have 1 and 2
– 10 –

adjacent3. Thus only orderings in the ﬁrst m rows and columns admit poles in s12 and we
can resolve our matrix of bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes into blocks,
Aφ3
n [α|β] =
 
P Q⊤
Q R
!
,
(2.27)
where P, Q and R are m × m, (n −m) × m and (n −m) × (n −m) matrices respectively.
Since s12 poles are not admitted by the last (n −m) orderings, the P matrix contains all
the elements with an s12 pole and Q and R do not contain any elements with an s12 pole.
Locality and unitarity of bi-adjoint scalar theory then demands that elements of Q and R
will have zero residue on the s12 pole, and a given element of P will have the form
Aφ3
n [12, σ(3, · · · , n)|12, σ′(3, · · · , n)] =Aφ3

near the pole. We will now assume that the orderings [P12, σ(3, · · · , n)] form a DDM basis
for n −1 particles {P12, 3, 4, ..., n}4. Thus the blocks are characterized by their behavior as
they approach the s12 pole,

(2.30)

section. Finally, using the geometric series formula for matrices, we get
(1 −P −1Q⊤R−1Q)−1 = 1 + O

with (n −3)! elements of the form [12σ(3, · · · , n −1)n]. One can then choose an ordering of basis elements
such that the assumed property is fulﬁlled.
4Returning to the example DDM basis [1σ(2, · · · , n −1)n], we see that this condition is satisﬁed, i.e.
[P12σ(3, · · · , n −1)n] forms a DDM basis.

It is straightforward to see that only the elements in the top left block will multiply ampli-

(2.36)
Thus, on a two-particle channel, an n-point amplitude generated by the massive KLT for-
mula factorizes into lower-point amplitudes also generated by (2.25), i.e. these amplitudes
factorize into the correct lower-point amplitudes. Since we chose to study the s12 pole
without loss of generality, this argument demonstrates factorization on all two-particle sin-
gularities.
2.3
Spurious Poles
We have seen so far that our proposed massive KLT formula has various nice properties.
It does not require BCJ-type constraints in order to get a consistent answer, allowing any
theory to be “double-copied”. In addition, it manifestly creates a set of amplitudes that
factorize into lower-point amplitudes on physical poles. These properties might suggest
that (2.25) can double-copy any massive theory into a diﬀerent local theory, but this is not
the case. While we saw in the previous section that all necessary physical poles are present
– 12 –

in (2.25), we did not check that these are the only poles, i.e. we did not test the presence
of spurious/non-physical poles in amplitudes resulting from (2.25).
In general the inverse of a matrix A−1 equals the matrix of cofactors times 1/detA. Cofac-
tors are sums of products of elements of A and hence no new poles can be generated in the
matrix of cofactors. Thus, all new poles must be a result of zeros of detA. Applying this
to (2.25), we ﬁnd that physical poles will appear in the matrix of cofactors, while spurious
poles could occur due to zeros of the determinant of Aφ3
n [α|β].
Let us ﬁrst understand how this is taken care of in the massless case. Here the BCJ relations
restrict us to a subset of the DDM basis. As a result, not all physical poles are present in
Aφ3
n [α|β]. Thus some physical poles must appear as zeros of the determinant of Aφ3
n [α|β],
while others will appear in the matrix of cofactors. For example at 4-point we have
Aφ3
4 [1234|1234] = −s13
s12s14
(2.37)
⇒det Aφ3
4 [1234|1234] = −s13
s12s14
.
(2.38)
Thus there is one zero of the determinant s13 = 0 and it is a physical pole. Due to the
color-ordering constraints, consistency with locality requires that A4[1234] does not have a
pole at s13 = 0. Thus, the zero of the determinant contributes a physical simple pole at
s13 = 0.
A similar structure exists at 5-point. Consider BCJ orderings like that in [5], [13524] and
[13542]. This gives
det Aφ3
5 [α|β] = −
s23s15s34
s12s13s14s24s45s35s25
.
(2.39)
Again we ﬁnd that zeros of the determinant s23 = s15 = s34 = 0, all correspond to physical
poles. In addition, the color-ordering requires A5[13524] and A5[13542] to have no poles at
these locations. Thus, zeros of the determinant contribute simple physical poles at 5-point
order as well.
Requiring locality of the massless KLT formula at 4- and 5-point, provides another moti-
vation for the fundamental BCJ relations. Only theories that satisfy the fundamental BCJ
relations can be double-copied to local theories, whose amplitudes are free of non-physical
poles and factorize on physical poles.
Let us now investigate what happens to our proposed massive KLT formula at 4-point. We
begin by choosing a basis of orderings ([1234], [1324]). This gives,
det Aφ3
4 [α|β] =
m2
(s12 + m2)(s13 + m2)(s14 + m2),
(2.40)
which has no zeros and thus no spurious pole can arise from the 4-point double-copy. This
has the interesting consequence that any massive theory can be inserted into the massive
KLT formula to obtain a 4-point amplitude of a local theory.
– 13 –

At 5-point, we are less lucky. Consider a basis of DDM orderings [13σ(245)] where σ runs
over all 6 permutations of (2, 4, 5), also used in [5]. Here we ﬁnd
det Aφ3
5 [α|β] = m8

Here, Di contains all the physical poles and P is a quartic polynomial in Mandelstams.
Allowing one of the Mandelstam invariants to vary independently, we ﬁnd that there are
four zeros of the determinant that do not correspond to physical poles. As a result, unless
the amplitudes A5[13σ(245)] conspire to cancel these spurious poles, the proposed massive
KLT formula will not give us amplitudes of a local theory. We expect that the presence of
spurious poles will persist at higher-point.
This analysis of the equivalent KLT form of the proposed massive double-copy reveals a
dangerous tension with locality. As we have argued, color-kinematics duality satisfying BCJ
numerators exist (at least up to n = 5) for generic models with uniform non-zero mass spec-
tra. But such a double-copy will contain spurious singularities unless magical cancellations
take place to remove them. Such cancellations will necessarily require additional relations
among the DDM basis of partial amplitudes. Since there is no analogue of the usual BCJ
relations, themselves a consequence of color-kinematics duality in massless models, these
relations must be genuinely new constraints.

Massive Gravity and (Massive Yang-Mills)2
To deﬁnitively establish that color-kinematics duality is not a suﬃcient condition for a
double-copy to be physical, it is enough to construct a single explicit counterexample. In
this section we analyze in detail the massive Yang-Mills EFT and demonstrate that a
BCJ representation of the scattering amplitudes with color-kinematics duality satisfying
numerators exists, at least up to 5-point. We see that 3- and 4-point scattering amplitudes
generated by the double-copy can be interpreted as coming from a theory of dRGT massive
gravity and show that at 5-point the would-be double-copied amplitude contains spurious
singularities.
3.1
Physical Motivation
To understand the model we consider and the independent physical arguments that suggest
a massive double-copy should be sensible, it is useful to begin with a slightly more general
class of models. We consider models with a global U(N) symmetry with a spectrum of
spin-1 states of mass m transforming in the adjoint representation. To ensure the existence
of a standard BCJ representation (1.8), we will restrict to interactions in which the color
indices are contracted using only the (totally anti-symmetric) structure constants fabc. The
most general such model with parity-conserving interaction terms of mass dimension up to
four is given by the Lagrangian5

Models of this kind with massive spinning states are generically only valid as low-energy
eﬀective descriptions. The associated scattering amplitudes violate perturbative unitarity
bounds at a parametrically low energy scale unless special tunings of couplings are made
or additional states such as Higgs bosons are introduced to soften the UV behaviour. An
eﬃcient way to observe this is to study high-energy ﬁxed angle, 2-to-2 scattering amplitudes.
Here we use explicit center-of-mass frame kinematics with polarization vectors,

The improved high-energy behaviour of this tuning has a nice physical explanation. The
massive Yang-Mills model has a simple (perturbative) UV completion as a particular limit
of a Higgsed gauge theory. We begin with a model of scalar ﬁelds φaa′ transforming in the

When λ > 0 and v2 > 0, the U(N)L × U(N)R symmetry is spontaneously broken to a
U(N) subgroup. Without loss of generality the vacuum expectation value can be taken to
have the form

the limit λ →∞with v held ﬁxed, decouple, with the low-energy dynamics of the massive
vector bosons described by the massive Yang-Mills EFT.
The Goldstone boson equivalence theorem [25] tells us that the high-energy scattering of
longitudinal vector modes of a spontaneously broken gauge theory must match the high-
energy limit of a coset sigma model describing the same symmetry breaking pattern. In
this case the coset is (U(N)L × U(N)R)/U(N)V , which is coincidentally the coset deﬁning

(3.13)
which precisely matches (3.4) in the limit g′ = g2, if the pion decay constant is identiﬁed
as fπ ∼m/g.
Massive Yang-Mills is not only a special EFT because it has softer than expected high-
energy growth. As the above discussion indicates, in the high-energy limit the scattering
amplitudes coincide with those of χPT, which is one of the few known massless models
exhibiting color-kinematics duality [2, 27], as can be veriﬁed explicitly using (3.13). As a
consequence, in the high-energy limit the massive Yang-Mills amplitudes can be double-
copied to give the scattering amplitudes of the special Galileon [28],

kinematics duality, to models with massive states, and in Section 2 constructed an equivalent

KLT-like formula. In this section we will demonstrate explicitly that such a double-copy
does not have the property (3.16) and moreover, for n > 4 does not produce a physical
scattering amplitude that can be matched to a local Lagrangian.
3.2
3-point Amplitudes and Asymptotic States
Before considering the dynamical content of the double-copy, we ﬁrst need to understand
the mapping of states in the asymptotic Hilbert space. Massive Yang-Mills is a model of
a massive vector boson, with 3 on-shell degrees of freedom in d = 4. The Hilbert space
of asymptotic one-particle states is spanned by the space of plane-wave solutions to the
linearized equations of motion. In the present context it is convenient to represent the basis
of linearly independent plane-wave solutions using the massive spinor formalism of [29]. In
this approach, the 3 independent spin states are collected together into a rank-2, totally
symmetric SU(2) little group tensor. Explicitly,
Aa IJ

where

(3.17)
The double-copy of such a plane-wave solution is given simply by replacing the color factor
ca with a second copy of the polarization vector,
Aa IJ

ν
(x) = hIJKL
µν

(3.18)
Where (3.17) transforms in an irreducible representation of SU(2), the double-copy (3.18)
transforms in a reducible representation.
Such a plane-wave double-copy is equivalent
to a tensor product of one-particle Hilbert spaces, for which standard decomposition of
representations of SU(2) gives the physical spectrum of the double-copy
3 ⊗3 = 5 ⊕3 ⊕1.
(3.19)
Hence we expect the double-copy of massive Yang-Mills to describe a model of a massive
graviton hµν (spin-2) coupled to a massive Kalb-Ramond two-form Bµν (spin-1) and a
massive dilaton φ (spin-0). It is most convenient to ﬁrst calculate the scattering amplitudes
for the reducible h-states, and project out the physical states as needed. To extract the
physical spectrum of the double-copy we use the following projection operators8

allows us to form a consistent truncation containing only the graviton and dilaton modes.

We begin with the double-copy of 3-point scattering amplitudes. This is of course uncon-
strained by color-kinematics duality, but will be important for reconstructing the massive

Feynman rules in Appendix C. This gives the following massive kinematic numerators

(3.29)
with the ﬁrst two lines coming from the exchange diagrams and the third line coming from
the contact diagram. The other numerators are found by taking
n13 = n12|1→3→2→1,
n14 = n12|1→2→3→1.
(3.30)
The 1/m2 term in the massive vector propagator vanishes, and so these numerators are
formally identical to the Feynman rule-generated expressions for massless Yang-Mills. As
a surprising consequence of the fact that at 4-point, all generalized gauges satisfy the
kinematic Jacobi identity, we ﬁnd that likewise for (3.29) and (3.30)
n12 + n13 + n14 = 0.

Massive gravity with the most generic potential without the dRGT tuning has an extra
scalar degree of freedom that is ghostly and 4-point scattering amplitudes that grow with
center-of-mass energy like E10. However, the dRGT tuning, which leaves only 2 free pa-
rameters, removes the ghostly degree of freedom and improves the high energy behavior
to scale with energy as E6 [33, 34]. Another common parameterization of dRGT massive
gravity is given in [35]. The leading high energy behavior in this parameterization, for the

Indeed the 3-point amplitude (3.24) corresponds to dRGT massive gravity with
α3 = −1
2 or c3 = 1
4.
(3.45)
This value is also the one picked out in the eikonal approximation analysis needed to avoid
superluminal propagation as shown in [36] and is the “partially massless" α3 [31, 37].
With the new cubic vertices that appear in the massive case, there are new scattering chan-
nels that appear in the quartic amplitudes that would not appear in the massless case. In
agreement with the general discussion in Section 2.2, we ﬁnd that all quartic amplitudes
factorize properly on the poles into products of the corresponding 3-point amplitudes. For
example, in the 4-graviton scattering amplitude, we ﬁnd contributions from diagrams cor-
responding to the s, t, u channels mediated by both a massive graviton and a dilaton, due to
the non-vanishing cubic coupling with 2 gravitons and 1 dilaton. The 4-graviton amplitude
matches that of massive gravity with the coeﬃcients
α4 = 7
48 or d5 = −7
192,
(3.46)
– 22 –

plus the additional channels mediated by the dilaton.
At ﬁrst glance, it may appear that a ﬁeld redeﬁnition could mix the cubic hhφ vertex and
massive gravity quartic interactions, leading to the choice of α4 to not be uniquely speciﬁed.
Since amplitudes are unaﬀected by ﬁeld redeﬁnition, we consider the diﬀerence between the
double-copied amplitude and the dRGT massive gravity amplitude with α3 = −1
2 and α4
left unspeciﬁed. We ﬁnd terms proportional to ∼(48α4 −7)Tr[ϵ1 ·ϵ2 ·ϵ3 ·ϵ4]. This structure
cannot be altered by introducing scalar channel diagrams and thus, requiring that it vanish
picks out the remaining parameter to be α4 = 7
48.
The leading high energy behavior of the amplitudes for graviton-graviton scattering in the
massive double-copy goes as:
M(2+000) = −
1
24
√
6st(s + t)
(3.47)
M(1+1+00) = −1
48st(s + t)

M(1+1−00) = 1
48st(s + t)
(3.49)
M(0000) =
7
144st(s + t).
(3.50)
For the value of c3 picked out by the double-copy, the high energy behavior of the 4-
point amplitudes for massive gravity, (3.37) through (3.42), is improved for amplitudes
where all the polarizations of the external particles are vector modes, scaling as E4 rather
than E6.
The dilaton aﬀects the coeﬃcient of M(0000), the amplitude where all the
external particles are scalar modes. Without the dilaton, this amplitude would behave as
M(0000) = −1
72st(s + t). All other amplitudes behave as they would without the dilaton
and are consistent with the above c3 and d5 values in expressions (3.37) through (3.42).
One immediate and important result from (3.47) is that the conjectured property (3.16)
does not hold for the BCJ double-copy. In the Goldstone boson equivalence limit for massive
Yang-Mills, only the spin-1 longitudinal mode contributes at E2. If (3.16) held, we would
expect only the scattering of a single scalar mode to contribute at E6 in the double-copy.
From (3.47), we see explicitly that this is not the case.
In the 4-point amplitude where all the external particles are dilatons, there will be s, t, u
channels mediated by a massive graviton, as well as s, t, u channels mediated by a dilaton,
and a 4-dilaton contact term. The massless case only has the channels mediated by the
massless graviton.
The 4-point amplitude with 2 gravitons and 2 dilatons exists in the massless and massive
case. In the massless case, this 4-point amplitude has graviton exchange channels via the
hφφ and hhh vertices and dilaton exchange channels via two hφφ vertices, plus a contact
term hhφφ. In the massive case, there will be additional graviton exchange channels via
two hhφ vertices, as well as dilaton exchange channels via the vertices hhφ and φφφ.
The 4-point amplitudes with 3 gravitons and 1 dilaton or 1 graviton and 3 dilatons are
– 23 –

unique to the massive case and involve all possible exchange diagrams with dilaton propa-
gators, as well as graviton propagators, and with additional hhhφ and hφφφ contact terms.
The high energy behavior of all the amplitudes scales with energy like ∼E6 or less and
the amplitudes that scale like E6 take the special galileon form st(s + t) [28]. As another
example, the leading high energy behavior of hφφφ amplitudes is shown below:

5-point Amplitudes and Non-Physical Singularities
As discussed in Section 2.2, 5-point massive gravity amplitudes constructed via the massive
KLT formula are guaranteed to factorize correctly into 4- and 3-point amplitudes (listed
in Appendix D and Section 3.2 respectively). Nonetheless as we saw at 4-point, checking
factorization at 5-point is a good cross-check of our more general results, in particular those
of Appendix B.
We begin by choosing a DDM basis of orderings [13 σ(2, 4, 5)] where σ runs over all possible
permutations. Using the Feynman rules of massive Yang-Mills, we then calculate partial
amplitudes and use the inverse of bi-adjoint scalar matrix (A.3) to construct 5-point all-
graviton amplitudes. The inverse of (A.3) is unwieldy so we do the following numerical
tests of factorization.
One can choose an independent basis of building blocks from the set of all (ϵi · ϵj), (ϵi · pj)
and (pi · pj). We then assign numeric values to all these kinematic structures except one,
without loss of generality let’s call this (p1·p2). One can then evaluate the 5-point amplitude
on this set of kinematic data and check that the residue on physical pole (p1 · p2) = −m2

is exactly what one would expect
Res
s12=−m2M5(12345) !=
X
X
M3 (12(−P12)X) × M4 ((P12) ¯
X345) ,
(3.53)
where X can either be a dilaton or a graviton. As expected from the general discussion
in Section 2.2 we ﬁnd that the would-be 5-point amplitude factors as expected on physical
poles.
While the correct factorization of the 5-point amplitude is promising, we saw in Section
2.3 that the KLT kernel suﬀers from non-physical poles arising from the determinant of
the matrix of bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes. These singularities (2.42) can only be removed
if special cancellations occur between amplitudes in the theory we are double-copying and
the KLT kernel.
– 24 –

In the context of this explicit example, we can proceed with our numerical analysis to check
for example, whether all poles in (p1 · p2) are physical. This can be done by evaluating the
KLT formula on an incomplete set of kinematic data that leaves (p1 · p2) unspeciﬁed. One
can then check if all singularities in (p1 · p2) are accounted for by locality. We ﬁnd that this
is not the case and that the resulting 5-point amplitude M5 does have spurious poles. The
singularity structure takes exactly the form (2.42) which can be recast as
P(sij, m2) =α1s4
12 + α2s3
12 + α3s2
12 + α4s12 + α5 ,
(3.54)
where αi are functions of the mass and other Mandelstam variables. Since this polynomial
does not easily factor into rational roots, it is useful to choose special kinematic conﬁgu-
rations where it factors more readily. In these cases, the exact locations of the spurious
poles can be found and the amplitude evaluated on such a non-physical pole gives a nonzero
residue.
Thus, no miraculous cancellations occur in massive Yang-Mills to get rid of spurious sin-
gularities. In particular this means that in its current form, massive Yang-Mills does not
sensibly double-copy to massive gravity.
Furthermore, if we attempt to save the double-copy, by for example, adding a 5-point
contact contribution to cancel these non-physical poles, we ﬁnd no improvement. Consider
for example adding a new operator at 5-point, such that
˜
A5[13542] = A5[13245] + αg3
m2 (p1 · ϵ3)(ϵ1 · ϵ2)(ϵ3 · ϵ5),
(3.55)
with contributions to the other orderings determined by relabeling. Here α is a free coeﬃ-
cient. The powers of m2 have been introduced to correct the mass dimension, this would
correspond to adding a term ∼∂A5 to the massive Yang-Mills Lagrangian.
We ﬁnd that there is no way to tune α to remove any of the spurious singularities. Since
it is unclear whether this statement still holds for arbitrary combinations of the other 28
possible ∂A5 structures, we cannot strictly rule out the possibility of a massive Yang-Mills
5-point operator removing non-physical poles from the KLT product.
Nonetheless, our
calculation is indicative that this may not be possible.
4
Locality and the Spectral Condition
We have seen that the proposed massive KLT construction (2.25) is in serious tension with
locality. In general, the inverse of the matrix of KK independent massive bi-adjoint scalar
amplitudes contains spurious, non-physical singularities (2.42). For the full KLT sum to be
free of these non-physical singularities, additional non-trivial constraints must be imposed.
These conditions are not met in the case of massive Yang-Mills, because as we saw in Section
3.4, the resulting 5-point massive gravity amplitude is not local. Thus, despite the existence
of color-kinematics duality satisfying numerators for all KK satisfying models, the resulting
– 25 –

would-be double copies only correspond to physical amplitudes if additional constraints are
imposed.
To better understand these additional constraints, let us ﬁrst look at the massless case. Here
the additional constraints are the fundamental BCJ relations and color-kinematics duality
satisfying numerators can only be found in theories whose amplitudes are BCJ-compatible.
In the language of bi-adjoint scalar theory, the double-copy formulation gives rise to physical
amplitudes only if the (n −2)! × (n −2)! matrix of bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes Aφ3[α|β]
has rank (n −3)!, which we will refer to as minimal rank. In addition, only theories whose
amplitudes satisfy the fundamental BCJ relations, which arise as null vectors of the singular
matrix of bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes, can be double-copied.
In the massive case, a matrix of bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes that has minimal rank can be
constructed if a speciﬁc condition on the masses, given by the equation det Aφ3[α|β] = 0 is
met. We will call this the spectral condition. The null vectors of this matrix will then give
rise to massive BCJ relations. On the basis of this observation, we propose the following:
Conjecture: The KLT prescription for double-copying models with massive states generates
physical amplitudes without spurious singularities, and reduces smoothly to the massless
double-copy in an appropriate m →0 decoupling limit, if the associated bi-adjoint scalar
matrix has minimal rank.
In this section we will illustrate the consequences of imposing these conditions on models
at n = 4 and n = 5. We will see how this alternative construction has both a commuting
decoupling limit and the absence of spurious singularities, providing evidence in support of
our conjecture above.
4.1
4-point Spectral Condition
We will begin with a model that has a more general spectrum of massive or massless
states. We denote the external states mi and the intermediate masses being exchanged on
a factorization channel as mij. The only assumption we will make is the existence of a BCJ
representation of the form
A4 (1a1, 2a2, 3a3, 4a4) =
c12n12
s12 + m2
12
+
c13n13
s13 + m2
13
+
c14n14
s14 + m2
14
.
(4.1)
Implicitly built into this expression is the assumption that only states with mass m2
12 are
exchanged in the s12-channel and so forth. This is not completely general and an interesting
open problem is to construct an appropriate generalization of the BCJ form for models
with multiple mass states exchanged in a single channel. We now choose a DDM basis
([1234], [1324]), in which the matrix of bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes is
Aφ3

.
(4.3)
Clearly Aφ3[α|β] is full-rank and non-singular, i.e. det Aφ3[α|β] does not vanish, for generic
mass spectra. In keeping with our conjecture, we want to reduce the rank of Aφ3[α|β] to
(4-3)!=1, which is the minimal rank at 4-point order. This is achieved by imposing the
following condition on the mass spectrum of the theory,
m2
12 + m2
13 + m2
14 = m2
1 + m2
2 + m2
3 + m2
4.
(4.4)
This is the 4-point spectral condition. It is interesting to note that the spectrum of massive
Yang-Mills does not satisfy this condition.
We will see later that this is what led the
double-copy and decoupling limit to fail to commute when studying massive (Yang-Mills)2.
On imposing the spectral condition, Aφ3[α|β] becomes singular and is no longer invertible.
As a result, we must eliminate one row and one column to produce an invertible matrix
of bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes. This is consistent only if all such choices give the same
result. For example, we could remove the second row and second column, the resulting
KLT formula is then
M4 (1, 2, 3, 4) = −
(s12 + m2
12)(s14 + m2
14)
s13 + (m2
1 + m2
2 + m2
3 + m2
4 −m2
12 −m2
14) A4[1, 2, 3, 4]2.
(4.5)
If however, we choose to eliminate the second row and the ﬁrst column, we ﬁnd
M4 (1, 2, 3, 4) = −(s14 + m2
14)A4[1, 2, 3, 4]A4[1, 3, 2, 4].
(4.6)
Equating these formulae constructs a massive version of the fundamental BCJ relation
(s12 + m2
12)A4[1, 2, 3, 4] = (s13 + m2
13)A4[1, 3, 2, 4],
(4.7)
where we have used the spectral condition to rewrite the relation in a more compact form.
As we prove in Appendix E, an equivalent way to derive the massive BCJ relation is by
studying the null vector of Aφ3[α|β] which is
⃗n =
 
−s12 −m2
12
s13 + m2
13
!
.
(4.8)
Setting the dot product of this vector with the DDM basis to zero then gives the BCJ
relation,
⃗n · (A5[1234]
A5[1324]) = (s12 + m2
12)A4[1, 2, 3, 4] −(s13 + m2
13)A4[1, 3, 2, 4] = 0. (4.9)
We are now in a position to study the singularity structure of the KLT formula (4.5). The
– 27 –

ﬁrst aspect of the formula that we note is the absence of spurious poles, i.e. all poles are at
physical locations. To ensure locality, we can study the amplitude in the neighbourhood of
its three physical poles. For example,
Res
s12=−m2
12
M4 (1, 2, 3, 4) = −(s14 + m2
14)
s13 + m2
13
A4[1, 2, −P12]2A3[P12, 3, 4]2
= A4[1, 2, −P12]2A3[P12, 3, 4]2
= M3 (1, 2, −P12) M3 (P12, 3, 4) ,
(4.10)
where we have used s13 +m2
13 = −s14 −m2
14 on the s12 pole. Thus the amplitude factorizes
correctly on the s12 pole. Factorization on the s13 and s14 pole follow in a similar manner.
It is easy to see that these forms of the massive BCJ relations and KLT formula smoothly
reduce to the massless ones when all external and intermediate masses, mi and mij are
taken to zero. As a result, this version of the massive double-copy does commute with the
decoupling limit. Thus for any pair of massive BCJ-compatible theories A(m) and B(m) that
satisfy the spectral condition, one can construct a local theory,
C(m) = A(m) ⊗m B(m) ,
(4.11)
where ⊗m is our conjectured massive KLT formalism. This will reduce in the decoupling
limit to

where ⊗denotes the massless KLT double-copy.
As we saw in Section 2.1, the massive KLT and massive BCJ double copies are equivalent.
Let us now understand our conjecture from the perspective of the BCJ double-copy. We
begin by considering the eﬀect of a generalized gauge transformation on the BCJ represen-
tation, similar to (1.10). The amplitude is invariant under the following replacements
n12 →n12 + (s12 + m2
12)∆
n13 →n13 + (s13 + m2
13)∆
n14 →n14 + (s14 + m2
14)∆,
(4.13)
for any function ∆. Putting these together we ﬁnd the kinematic Jacobi sum of numerators
transforms as
n12 + n13 + n14 →n12 + n13 + n14 +

∆. (4.14)
If the spectral condition is not satisﬁed then we can always ﬁnd a generalized gauge in
– 28 –

which the numerators satisfy color-kinematics duality by using,
∆= −
n12 + n13 + n14
 m2
12 + m2
13 + m2
14 −m2
1 −m2

.
(4.15)
If the spectral condition is satisﬁed, however, then there is no choice of ∆that can construct
numerators that satisfy the kinematic Jacobi relations from ones that do not. Hence the
existence of kinematic Jacobi-satisfying numerators is a non-trivial constraint on the space
of BCJ-like models, equivalent to imposing the massive fundamental BCJ relations.
At 4-point, we saw that there is a well-chosen BCJ basis in which the KLT kernel is
polynomial, and therefore together with the discussion in Section 2.3, the resulting formula
deﬁnes an amplitude with only physical singularitites. The BCJ version of this statement is
that if the spectral condition is satisﬁed, and there exist color-kinematics duality satisfying
numerators, then the BCJ double-copy is free of spurious singularities.
It is clear that a model with a uniform mass spectrum like massive Yang-Mills could only
satisfy the 4-point spectral condition if all of the states have zero mass. For more compli-
cated models, with states of multiple masses, the constraints are very restrictive. We will
now illustrate these constraints with a few examples.
Example 1: Compton Scattering
Consider a model such as Yang-Mills minimally coupled to a complex adjoint scalar with
mass m ̸= 0. There are three factorization channels contributing to the Compton amplitude
g + φ →g + φ:
The ﬁrst diagram contributes twice, corresponding to exchanging the labels on the gluons.
Here the spectral condition is satisﬁed since for the external states
m2
1 + m2
2 + m2
3 + m2
4 = 2m2,
(4.16)
while for the internal states
m2
12 + m2
13 + m2
14 = 2m2.
(4.17)
We must keep in mind that the spectral condition is only a conjectured necessary condition
for the existence of a local double-copy, not a suﬃcient one. For a theory to produce a local
double-copy, it must also satisfy the BCJ relations. The fact that a sensible double-copy of
Compton scattering amplitudes can be deﬁned only if the theory satisﬁes the massive BCJ
relations (4.7) was ﬁrst observed in [10].

Example 2: Bhabha Scattering
In the same model as the previous example we can consider Bhabha scattering φ+φ →φ+φ
which has two contributing factorization channels related by relabelling:
Here the spectral condition is not satisﬁed since for the external states

(4.22)
Since the spectral condition is not satisﬁed, there are no associated fundamental BCJ con-
ditions. Similar to the 4-point massive Yang-Mills calculation, we can ﬁnd color-kinematics
duality satisfying numerators and take a massive double-copy, but such an amplitude should
not have a smooth m →0 limit. It is instructive to see this explicitly. We begin with the
tree-amplitude calculated using ordinary Feynman rules for a minimally coupled scalar

The corresponding BCJ numerators,

While this is a perfectly physical scattering amplitude, the massive double-copy has gen-
erated a contact contribution corresponding to a local operator of the form
1
m2M2p (∂φ)4,
which diverges as m →0.
Example 3: Kaluza-Klein Theory
An important class of examples arises from the dimensional reduction of the massless KLT
relations in higher dimensions, some of which have already been discussed in [11–14, 18].
This has the eﬀect of generating a Kaluza-Klein tower of states and vertices that conserve
Kaluza-Klein number. This conservation law manifests as a conservation of mass at each
vertex. For concreteness, consider a d = 5 scalar model compactiﬁed on R4 × S1, and
take for example the scattering process 1 + 2 →3 + 4, where all of the external states are
right-moving (p4
i = +mi) states. At the vertices the masses satisfy the sum rules
m1 + m2 = m12
m1 −m3 = m13
m1 −m4 = m14
m1 + m2 = m3 + m4.
(4.27)

In this case as well, the spectral condition holds with no further constraints,

(4.28)
Thus any theory that arises as a dimensional reduction of a massless BCJ-compatible theory
will automatically satisfy the spectral condition and thus it will give a local double-copy.
Such a model gives a complete example, for which every scattering amplitude satisﬁes the
spectral constraints, and moreover, if the higher-dimensional model satisﬁes the massless
BCJ relations then so too will the lower-dimensional Kaluza-Klein model.
We leave as
future work the problem of determining if there are additional complete examples which
are not obtained by dimensional reduction.
4.2
5-point Spectral Conditions
Locality places the strongest constraints on the massive double-copy.
As was exempli-
ﬁed in Section 3.4, demanding the existence of color-kinematics duality satisfying 5-point
numerators is not a strong enough condition to ensure locality of double-copied 5-point
amplitudes. A natural question is what conditions need to be satisﬁed at 5-point in order
for the resulting double-copied amplitude to be local.
We set the calculation up in a manner similar to the 4-point case. We assume the existence
of a BCJ representation and allow for general external and intermediate masses, mi and
mij respectively. Here the masses mij are exchanged on the ij 2-particle channel. We can
then write down a bi-adjoint scalar matrix (A.3) where each propagator sij + m2 is now
replaced by sij + m2
ij.
We know that 5-point amplitudes need to factorize on 2-particle channels to give 4-point
amplitudes. At 4-point, we saw that locality is only ensured by requiring that the matrix of
bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes is singular. This is achieved via the so-called spectral condition
(4.4). On demanding that this condition is satisﬁed on every possible 4-point amplitude
that could result on a factorization channel, we come up with the following set of conditions,
m2
ij + m2
ik + m2
jk = m2
i + m2
j + m2
k + m2
pq
(4.29)
for each triplet i, j, k and where p, q are the leftover elements in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. There
are 5C3 = 10 such relations, but they are not all independent. We can reduce them to 5

We will refer to these as the 5-point spectral conditions. These conditions indeed make the bi-
adjoint scalar matrix singular. Further, they reduce the rank of the (n−2)!×(n−2)! = 6×6
matrix from full-rank to minimal rank, (n −3)! = 2.

and Di are as deﬁned in Appendix A.
To explicitly see that the resulting amplitude is local, we perform the following tests. First,
we look at the denominator of the resulting KLT formula,

23 + s23)(s34 + m2
34),
(4.37)
again with the understanding that mij satisfy the spectral conditions (4.30) and note that
the KLT formula only has poles in physical locations.
Second, we must check that AA⊗B
5
(12345) factorizes correctly on all poles. Let us look at
an example. Consider the pole s23 →−m2

The massive BCJ relation (4.34) tells us that the expression in the square brackets is
A5[13254] which factorizes into A3[32(−P23)] × A4[P23541] on the pole to give

(4.39)
where we have used the 4-point KLT formula in the last step. Thus the amplitude factorizes
correctly on the s23 = −m2
23 pole.
One can proceed in a similar manner (either with or without the help of massive BCJ
relations) to determine that the 5-point KLT formula (4.35) factorizes correctly on all
poles. Thus, given a theory that satisﬁes the 5-point spectral conditions, the KLT formula
constructs local amplitudes, giving us a sensible deﬁnition of the 5-point double-copy.
4.3
Non-minimal Rank
There is a new possibility that arises at higher-point which is not present at 4-point. This
is the ability to reduce the rank of a bi-adjoint scalar matrix from full-rank (n −2)! not
to minimal rank (n −3)!, but somewhere in between (n −2)! and (n −3)!. Since this too
makes the (n −2)! × (n −2)! matrix singular, one might imagine this to be an alternate
– 34 –

approach to the massive double-copy that does not require all four BCJ relations to hold.
Indeed such a procedure does not give rise to local amplitudes. Let us understand how this
works at 5-point.
By imposing all-but-one of the spectral conditions (4.30), the rank of the 5-point bi-adjoint
scalar matrix reduces from 6 to 4, rather than minimal rank 2. For example, let us choose
not to impose the spectral condition on m2
34. Since the resulting expressions are diﬃcult to
manipulate analytically, we proceed in a particular kinematic conﬁguration where all-but-
one (let us say s12) independent Mandelstam variables are ﬁxed.
We can now check the behaviour of the double-copied amplitude as we approach the pole
s12 = −m2
12. We want the double-copied amplitude to factorize as,
Res
s12=−m2
12
AA⊗B
5
(12345) =AA⊗B
3
(12(−P12)) × AA⊗B
4
(P12345).
(4.40)
We ﬁnd that this condition is not met unless,
m2
34 = 2m2
1 −m2
12 −m2
13 −m2
14 + 2m2
2 −m2
23 −m2
24 + 2m2

4 + m2
5,
(4.41)
which is exactly the spectral condition that we left out. Thus, by not imposing all of the
BCJ relations, we do not construct local amplitudes.
This supports our conjecture: only by imposing all BCJ relations, i.e. reducing the bi-
adjoint scalar matrix to minimal rank, can we construct local amplitudes via the KLT
formula.

Discussion
The proposition of a KLT construction for the double-copy of massive particles opens up
many areas of exploration and application. In Section 3, we see that the double-copy of
massive Yang-Mills is ill-deﬁned due to the presence of spurious singularities in the would-
be double-copied 5-point amplitude. It is still left as an open question whether or not this
construction can be salvaged. For example, can we add 5-point operators or new degrees
of freedom to the massive Yang-Mills EFT to construct a local double-copy?
Another interesting question is what happens when the bi-adjoint Higgs model presented in
Section 3 is double copied with itself. It has been shown that the high energy behaviour of a
theory of Λ3 massive gravity cannot be improved by introducing vector or scalar interactions
[38]. Therefore, we expect the double-copy of the bi-adjoint Higgs model to fail. A better
understanding of the precise nature of this failure would be interesting.
An important assumption that lead to the derivation of the mass spectral conditions pre-
sented in Section 4 was that a unique mass is exchanged in each factorization channel.
We know that a massless KLT formula can be constructed that allows for the exchange of
particles of multiple masses on each channel [20]. It would be interesting to see how this
construction generalizes to the case of massive external particles and more general spectra.
– 35 –

In addition, we would like to better understand the landscape of theories that produce a local
double-copy. We saw examples of dimensionally reduced BCJ-compatible theories in which
the Kaluza-Klein tower of massive states and interactions between them manifestly satisfy
the spectral condition and hence result in local double-copied amplitudes. We would like
to understand whether there are double-copy-compatible theories that do not result from a
dimensional reduction.
Finally, in Section 4, we saw that spurious singularities are removed if the spectral condi-
tions and massive BCJ relations are satisﬁed. However, we know that massive bi-adjoint
scalar theory trivially provides an explicit counter-example to making the converse state-
ment, since it will produce a local, massive double-copy even if the spectral conditions are
not satisﬁed. It is therefore an interesting open problem to determine if there exist further,
non-trivial, examples of massive models which double-copy to physical scattering ampli-
tudes but do not satisfy the spectral condition. One pathway to such a construction would
be to try and ﬁnd a model which admits a local, oﬀ-shell representation of the kinematic
algebra, similar to [39, 40]. Since the numerators of such a model are local by construction,
it is clear from the BCJ form of the double-copy that no spurious poles can be generated.
Even more interestingly, given such a set of local, kinematic Jacobi satisfying numerators,
we can always form a heterotic double-copy with the numerators of a generic, spectral con-
dition violating, massive model. Since the result does not depend on the generalized gauge
used for the numerators of the latter, they can always be taken to be the local representa-
tion given by Feynman rules, and so even in this case, we see that no spurious poles can be
generated. We see then that constructing even a single example of a model with a local,
oﬀ-shell representation of the kinematic algebra, is suﬃcient to generate an inﬁnite number
of examples of healthy, massive double-copies. We leave this and similar investigations to
future work.

Multi-Particle Factorization
The argument in Section 2.2 generalizes straightforwardly to multi-particle factorization.
Without loss of generality we will consider factorization on the singularity
P 2 = m2,
where P µ ≡pµ
1 + pµ
2 + ... + pµ
k−1 + pµ
k.
(B.1)
A double-ordered bi-adjoint scalar amplitude will contain such a singularity only if both its
orderings have {1, 2, ..., k} cyclically adjacent. As we did in Section 2.2, we choose a DDM
basis for the n-point amplitudes in which the minimal number of amplitudes with a P 2
factorization singularity appear. A natural choice is
{Aφ3
n [1, α, n|1, β, n] : α, β ∈P (2, 3, ..., n −1)}.
(B.2)
The subset of these amplitudes which have a P 2 = m2 singularity have the form
{Aφ3
n [1, σ, ρ, n|1, σ′, ρ′, n] : σ, σ′ ∈P (2, 3, ..., k −1, k) , ρ, ρ′ ∈P (k + 1, k + 2, ..., n −1, n)}.
(B.3)
– 39 –

Near the singularity such amplitudes have the form
Aφ3
n [1, σ, ρ, n|1, σ′, ρ′, n] = Aφ3
k+1[1, σ, −P|1, σ′, −P]Aφ3
k+1[P, ρ, n|P, ρ′, n]
P 2 + m2
+ O
 (P 2 + m2)0
.
(B.4)
Placing all such amplitudes in the top-left-hand corner of the matrix of biadjoint-scalar
amplitudes, we obtain the same result as in Section 2.3, that only amplitudes of this form
are important on the factorization channel when using the block decomposition inverse
formula (2.33). Here the associated subspaces are indexed by a pair of orderings (σ, ρ) on
the left and (σ′, ρ′) on the right. The required inverse is then given by

(B.5)
This is an application of a general result for the so-called Kronecker product of matrices
(P ⊗Q)−1 = P −1 ⊗Q−1.
(B.6)
Verifying that this is true is trivial in component form. We label the components as Pik
and Qjl, the Kronecker product is then deﬁned component-wise as (P ⊗Q)ijkl ≡PikQjl.
The right-inverse is deﬁned to satisfy
X
m,n
(P ⊗Q)ijmn(P ⊗Q)−1
mnkl = δikδjl.
(B.7)
It is straightforward to see that this is satisﬁed by matrices of the form
(P ⊗Q)−1
mnkl = (P −1)mk(Q−1)nl,
(B.8)
and similarly for the left-inverse. Using this result, on the neighborhood of the P 2 = m2

So we ﬁnd that the massive KLT formula generates expressions which factor correctly on
all singularities.

Feynman Rules for Massive Yang-Mills

BCJ Relations as Null Vectors
The BCJ relations can be obtained as null space relations of the matrix of bi-adjoint scalar
amplitudes. To show this, one must ﬁrst notice a remarkable property about these am-
plitudes. Just as in the massless case, bi-adjoint scalar theory acts as an identity for the
– 44 –

massive double-copy11, i.e.
A ⊗BS = A .
(E.1)
To express this in matrix notation, let us ﬁrst choose an (n −2)! DDM basis. From this,
we choose BCJ-independent (n −3)! sub-bases α, β and γ and use the KLT formula,
Aφ3[α|β] Aφ3[β|γ]−1 ⃗AA[γ] = ⃗AA[α].
(E.2)
The BCJ relations are consistency conditions that make the KLT formula basis-independent.
For example, consider another (n −3)! sub-basis ˜γ. We can then express a BCJ relation as
Aφ3[α|β] Aφ3[β|γ]−1 ⃗AA[γ] = Aφ3[α|β] Aφ3[β|˜γ]−1 ⃗AA[˜γ] .
(E.3)
We now embed these matrices in our original (n −2)! DDM basis. The matrix Aφ3[α|β] is
padded with the remaining bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes, while we pad the vector

Aφ3[β|γ]−1 ⃗AA[γ] −Aφ3[β|˜γ]−1 ⃗AA[˜γ]

(E.4)
with zeros. This gives us the following null vector equation,
Aφ3[α|β]

Aφ3[β|γ]−1 ⃗AA[γ] −Aφ3[β|˜γ]−1 ⃗AA[˜γ]

= 0 .
(E.5)
To connect this to the BCJ relations of theory A, we consider a double-copy of A with
itself,
A ⊗A = B.
(E.6)
Choosing the same sub-bases as previously, we can rewrite the KLT formula,
⃗AA[β]T Aφ3[β|γ]−1 ⃗AA[γ] = ⃗AB.
(E.7)
Again the BCJ relations are given by demanding basis-independence of this formula,
⃗AA[β]T Aφ3[β|γ]−1 ⃗AA[γ] = ⃗AA[β]T Aφ3[β|˜γ]−1 ⃗AA[˜γ]
⇒
⃗AA[β]T 
Aφ3[β|γ]−1 ⃗AA[γ] −Aφ3[β|˜γ]−1 ⃗AA[˜γ]

= 0.
(E.8)
We recognize this vector as being a null vector of Aφ3[α|β]. Indeed this equation must hold
for all choices of γ and ˜γ. At 4- and 5-point, we observe that diﬀerent choices of γ and ˜γ
span the null space of Aφ3[α|β], allowing us to generalize this equation to,
⃗AA[β] · ⃗n = 0,
(E.9)
11It is an interesting fact that this is true whether or not the spectral conditions hold.
– 45 –

where the vector ⃗n is any null vector of the matrix of bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes.
Thus (E.9) is an equivalent representation of the BCJ relations. Since the number of null
vectors of Aφ3[α|β] is exactly the number of independent BCJ relations, we expect this
equivalence to continue to any n-point.
