 an earlier union. Of more concern is premarital pregnancy. Women who married
 early may have been more fecund and therefore more likely to have an accidental
 nonmarital pregnancy. The decline with age at marriage in proportions becoming
 mothers would then be greater than the natural decline in fecundity. When
 premaritally pregnant women (as determined by a birth within 7 months of
 marriage) were excluded from the English data, however, the age patterns were
 virtually unchanged. Data on all women were used for comparability with census
 tabulations.

 have been hypothesized to account for the phenomena observed in
 active galactic nuclei (6).
 For over 20 years, active galactic nuclei have been one of the
 major topics in astronomy and astrophysics. They come in various
 forms, radio galaxies, quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and BL Lacertid
 objects, constituting a few percent of the known galaxies (7). They
 are distinguished by several characteristics. They exhibit very ener-
 getic activities in the central regions of galaxies. The luminosity L of
 these active nuclei is extremely high; some can produce ~1046 erg/
 sec [-1012 the solar luminosity (Lo), 4 x 1033 erg/sec] of continu-
 um radiation. Such radiation is sometimes found to vary on time
 scales as short as days, implying that the source is 1017 cm in
 extent. Thus, in some cases, as much radiation as is produced by the
 stars in an entire galaxy [typically 100,000 light-years in diameter (1
 light-year = 9.46 x 1017 cm)] is generated within the central light-
 year. Another common characteristic is the presence of high-density
 ionized gas moving at speeds sometimes reaching 0.03 c within the
 central few light-years. The origin of these high velocities is not
 understood.
 Some active galactic nuclei are also very powerful radio sources.
 Such radio sources, by virtue of their nonthermal radiation mecha-
 nism (synchrotron radiation), which involves highly relativistic
 electrons spiraling in magnetic fields, require settings other than
 ordinary stars for their production. The nuclear component of these
 radio sources typically has an elongated structure (jet) emanating
 from a compact core and is exceedingly bright (8).
 The central question associated with active galactic nuclei is how
 the enormous amounts of energy are generated at high efficiency
 within a compact volume. This requirement leads inevitably to
 gravitation. In the massive black hole model of active galactic nuclei
 (6), energy is derived from the release of gravitational binding
 energy of matter falling into the black hole. This mechanism is in
 principle a much more efficient method for generating energy than
 nuclear fusion and can operate in a very confined space (9).
 However, despite all the advantages of the massive black hole

 accumulate at the nucleus of a galaxy. The final result is likely to be the
 formation of a massive black hole. Adapted from (5).

 models and despite the dedicated observational efforts of many types
 of astronomers, direct evidence for massive black holes is lacking,
 because the angular resolution of the telescopes is insufficient.
 Conventional ground-based optical and infrared observations are
 limited to resolutions of -0.5 arc sec. For a black hole with a mass
 of -3 x 108 solar masses (Mo) (solar mass = 2 x 1033 g) at a
 distance from Earth of 300 x 106 light-years, typical of an extraga-
 lactic active nucleus, R,S is 1014 cm and subtends an angle of <10-7
 arc sec. This is only 10-3 of the highest resolution (10-4 arc sec)
 currently achievable with very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI)
 techniques (10).
 The distance to our galactic nucleus is 1/70 of the distance to the
 nearest extragalactic nucleus. At a distance of about 30,000 light-
 years, 10-4 arc sec corresponds to I AU (1 astronomical unit =
 1.5 x 1013 cm) or the Schwarzschild radius of a 5 x 107 MQ black
 hole. Thus, our galactic nucleus can be observed in great detail. It
 exhibits phenomena similar to those in other active galactic nuclei
 (11). In particular, within I light-year of the peak of the star
 distribution at the nucleus are found a very compact radio source
 (diameter <20 AU), which is the best candidate for a massive black
 hole, a source of luminosity at -107 LD, and a source of very high
 velocity ionized gas. This region may also be a copious source of
 positrons responsible for an extraordinary 0.51-MeV y-ray line
 observed toward the center. Finally, there may be dynamical evi-
 dence for the existence of a central point mass.
 The Galactic Center
 Because the sun is located on the outskirts of the plane of our
 galaxy, the actual galactic center is obscured from view by the large
 amount of intervening dust (only 10- 12 of the visible light from the
 center reaches Earth). As a result, in the study of the galactic center,
 radio and infrared techniques (5 m A X I ,um) have been used
 because long wavelength radiation can penetrate the dust. For
 example, an infrared picture of the inner galaxy made with the
 Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) (Fig. 2a) shows the more
 distant parts of the galaxy compared to the visible-light image (Fig.
 2b). In particular, it shows the galactic center as the brightest and
 warmest bulge.
 Although the stars at the center cannot be observed with visible
 light, they can be traced in the near-infrared (X = 2 ,um) where the
 radiation is predominantly due to the red giant stars. If the giant
 stars constitute a constant fraction of all the stars everywhere, the 2-
 pm light distribution would describe the star distribution. The 2-
 IUm observations suggest that the star distribution in the central
 region resembles a flattened spheroid in which the density increases
 inward, roughly as r-1 8 where r is the distance to the center (12).
 The central star density is as high as 106 MD per cubic light-year,
 about 108 times that in the solar neighborhood.
 The first extraterrestrial radio wave detected on Earth was from
 the powerful radio source at the galactic center-Sagittarius A (Sgr
 A) (13)-which is the strongest radio source associated with our
 galaxy (Fig. 3) (14). Sgr A comprises a mixture of thermal radiation
 from ionized gas and synchrotron radiation. From the thermal
 emission, we infer a large ultraviolet (UV) flux which is required to
 maintain the ionization of the gas; the nonthermal radiation requires
 sources of relativistic electrons. The mere presence of Sgr A indicates
 that the central region is more than a quiescent collection of stars.
 The discovery in 1951 of the hyperfine structure line (X = 21 cm)
 of atomic hydrogen in interstellar space provided a powerful tool
 with which to probe the interstellar medium (15). The penetrating
 power of this radio frequency line made it possible to demonstrate
 the large-scale spiral structure of the galaxy (16). When similar

 observations were directed toward the galactic center, the surprising
 result was that, as far out as 10,000 light-years from the center, the
 gas is not only rotating but also expanding at high velocity. This was
 unexpected since, until then, the accepted picture of our galaxy had
 been that it was a flat, circular, differentially rotating disk. The very
 large kinetic energy in the expanding motion was taken as evidence
 for extraordinarily powerful explosions at the nucleus in the past.
 This was the earliest indication of energetic activities at the center
 (17).
 In 1971, Lynden-Bell and Rees analyzed the infrared luminosity
 and other observations of the central region of our galaxy and
 proposed that the ultimate energy source is a black hole. They also
 suggested that a very compact nonthermal radio source might be
 detected at the center, as one of the critical observations for testing
 their hypothesis (18). In 1974, such a source was unambiguously
 detected first by Balick and Brown (19). The properties of the
 compact source are similar to those of the extragalactic compact
 sources found in quasars and radio galaxies. Most importantly, the
 source is extremely small, imposing a very stringent constraint on
 models for the source.

 (lower right) to 24? (upper left); the cross marks the location of the galactic

 foreground dust in the galactic plane. What is seen is dominated by dust and
 At about the same time, observations of the radio recombination
 lines from Sgr A revealed the presence of ionized gas moving at
 much greater speeds than the expected thermal motion (20).
 Subsequent higher resolution observations of singly ionized neon
 suggested that the velocity dispersion of the ionized gas increases
 toward the center, with radial velocities reaching ?+260 km/sec
 within 0.7 light-year of the center. If the motion of the ionized gas is
 governed by gravity, then the observed speeds would indicate a
 highly concentrated mass distribution, and possibly a point mass of
 3 x 106 Mo (21).
 Until recently, observations of Sgr A have been limited in angular
 resolution. With the completion of the National Radio Astronomy
 Observatory's Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, high-
 sensitivity and high-resolution imaging of radio emission from the
 galactic center has become possible (22). Over the last 5 years, such
 images have revealed unexpected features and a range of intriguing
 activities in our galactic center that are observable only because of its
 proximity. Figure 4a shows such a radio picture of the inner -0.5?
 (-300 light-years) of the galaxy, showing Sgr A along with the so-
 called Arc source (23).
 stars fairly close to the sun, within about 3000 light-years. In (a) the infrared
 emission comes from the more distant parts of the galactic plane where the
 dust heated by stars produces the bright diagonal band; the galactic center is
 the yellow bulge near the center of the band. Giant interstellar clouds of gas

 The Arc source contains some of the more surprising features
 uncovered by the VLA images-highly organized, linear structures
 running perpendicular to the galactic plane. They are strikingly
 regular, unbroken, and homogeneous in appearance. Each of the
 filaments is -100 light-years long and -3 light-years wide (23).
 Apparently wrapping around the linear features are curved radio
 emission features that may be connected to Sgr A. Such organized
 linear structures require a confinement mechanism for the radiating
 electrons that would otherwise disperse in a very short time. The
 most natural scheme involves large-scale magnetic fields along the
 linear structures. This is confirmed by the observations of high
 intrinsic polarization in the radio emission, indicating synchrotron
 radiation (24). Comparison with larger scale maps (Fig. 4b) (25) of
 the galactic center shows that these linear features are actually
 enhanced emission at the base of a larger f-shaped loop structure

 Extending -80 light-years and centered on the peak of the central
 star cluster, Sgr A has a highly disturbed appearance and shows
 some unusual internal structure. A close-up view (Fig. 5) reveals an
 oval nonthermal source that may be the remnant of a supernova and
 an intriguing "spiral" radio source at one edge of it (26). The
 "spiral" structure, called Sgr A West, is thermal radiation from high-
 density ionized gas. At the centroid of the ionized gas distribution
 and of Sgr A is the compact nonthermal radio source (Sgr A*).

 central potential well, is not well defined on a scale smaller than 0.3
 light-year. The most compact object, Sgr A*, is within 0.2 light-year
 of the 2-uum source, infrared source (IRS) 16, which may be
 identified with the peak of the underlying star distribution (14). A
 component of IRS 16 has also been suggested as the central
 luminous source, with a total luminosity of -107 LQ (27, 28).
 Within 0.3 light-year of IRS 16, very broad hydrogen and helium
 emission lines have been detected, with large line widths (-1500
 km/sec) typical of the high-speed gas found in active galactic nuclei
 (29).
 A unique 0.51-MeV y-ray line was also observed in the general
 direction of the galactic center (30). The line was measured with
 very high spectral resolution so that its identification with e+e-
 annihilation and positronium decay seem rather secure (31). Be-
 cause y-ray observations have very poor angular resolution, the
 origin of the positrons (e +) is highly uncertain. Most unexpectedly,
 the line was found to vary with a 6-month time scale (32), indicating
 a compact source for the line and also a single compact source of e+.
 It has been assumed that this source of e+, with a minimum
 required production rate of 1043 e+ per second, is located at the
 galactic center (33).
 The Compact Nonthermal Radio Source
 (Sgr A*)
 The compact nonthermal radio source, located within 0.2 light-
 year of the dynamical center of the galaxy, may be the key to the
 activities there. Efforts to determine its structure have continued for
 many years (34). Because of a combination of practical difficulties
 and the source properties, the structure is still not well known.
 However, the latest observations set an upper limit of <20 AU for
 the source diameter. (The source would fit inside the orbit of
 Saturn.) The observations also reveal an elongation in the source at
 A = 3.6 cm, with the position angle of the major axis nearly parallel
 to the rotation axis of the galaxy (35). Whether this reflects the
 presence of a jet structure is not known. The most recently observed
 parameters of Sgr A* are summarized in Table 1. Sgr A* has
 properties very similar to those of extragalactic compact radio
 sources, except for its much lower luminosity. Unlike the extragalac-
 tic case, however, its extremely small dimensions effectively preclude
 a dense star cluster as a possible energy source and admit only
 objects with stellar dimensions.
 Can this source be powered by a stellar object? Stellar radio
 sources are known in the form of pulsars (powered by the rotational
 energy of a neutron star), binary stellar radio sources (powered by
 accretion onto a white dwarf, neutron stars or even stellar black
 holes), or very young supernovae. Radio emission associated with
 stellar atmospheric activities (such as solar flares) is negligibly weak
 by comparison.
 Ordinary pulsars fail to explain Sgr A* because the brightest
 pulsar known has only 10-4 times the radio luminosity of Sgr A*.
 Although Sgr A* becomes stronger at higher frequency, pulsars
 have exactly the opposite behavior (indicating a different radiating
 mechanism). Some binary x-ray sources are also radio sources, but
 they are characterized by frequent intensity outbursts. Their typical
 luminosity is 10-5 that of Sgr A*, and the brightest one reaches a
 luminosity that is only 0.1 that of Sgr A* at the peak of an outburst.
 A young supernova is very compact and could be very bright, but
 the luminosity decays in a few years as the source expands (36), and
 the supernova remnant expands very rapidly (37). Sgr A* is
 unusually steady and there is a rather stringent limit on the
 expansion speed, far below what is observed in young supernovae.
 1398
 A neutron star can supply a total power up to a few times
 erg/sec (38), so that such an object can in principle power the
 erg/sec of radio luminosity from Sgr A*. The most promising m,
 along such lines is based on an incoherent synchrotron so
 confined by ram pressure but powered by a pulsar (39). T(
 confined, the source must move at high velocity through a d
 interstellar cloud. Recent observational limits on proper motion
 lack of a high-density cloud around Sgr A*, the new upper lim
 the source size, and the high turnover frequency all tend to rule
 such a model (35).
 On the basis of observational evidence, Sgr A* is a unique r;
 source in the galaxy, and it cannot be accounted for on the bas
 any known stellar source. Though faint by comparison with extr
 lactic compact radio sources, Sgr A* is orders of magnitude stroi
 than the typical stellar radio sources. Sgr A* could be due to I
 level accretion onto a -106 MG black hole (40), and it has a
 consistent with such a black hole (<103 times RS). Moreover,
 A* resembles closely a weaker version of the nuclear radio sour(
 external galaxies, such as M81 and M104. Such extragalactic nu(
 sources have too large a radio luminosity to be powered by a st
 object. Nonetheless, although the best explanation for Sgr A* is

 around young massive stars that ionize all the surroundings gas (out of
 which they have been formed), in the well-known nebulae such as Orion and
 Rosette. The unusual filamentary structures shown here reflect the special
 conditions found at the galactic center.

 unique in the galaxy. The ionized gas is clumpy and patchy, with
 three bright "arms" close to the center. For convenience, they will be
 termed north, east, and west arms (top, left, and right, respectively,
 in Fig. 6). Fainter features are found on the periphery of the
 distribution, such as the arm to the south.
 Spectroscopic observations, based on the 12.8-pum line from
 singly ionized neon and recombination lines of hydrogen, have
 provided information on the radial motion (15, 21, 43, 44). In
 particular, they show that the radial velocity of the ionized gas varies
 systematically northward along the arm to the south, past the
 western arm. Where the south and west arms apparently meet, there
 is a break; there is also a large difference in the brightness of the two
 arms. Moreover, there is a velocity discontinuity between the two
 arms at that point. Together, these data suggest that the south arm is
 not connected to the western arm but continues northward to the
 tip of the north arm. The obvious picture of an S-shaped "spiral" is
 misleading.
 The higher surface brightness of the north arm suggests that it is
 closer to the central ionizing source. The south and the north arms
 together may form a coherent stream of ionized gas orbiting about
 and spiraling into the center in a plane whose normal is inclined to
 the line of sight by -65? (42). Numerical simulations have shown
 that such a feature can result from a cloud of gas, which, on
 experiencing drag from the medium it is moving through, spirals
 inward in a central potential and is stretched out by tidal effects (45);
 according to this hypothesis, the east and west arms are independent
 streams of ionized gas passing by the center, lying in a different
 plane from the south and north arms (42). An alternate picture is
 that the south arm is the ionized inner edge of a neutral gas ring

 The explanation that the arms are ejecta in two opposite dire

 natural consequence of such a mechanism-point reflection symm
 try in the paths of the ejecta-is not observed. Sgr A*, the natu
 choice for the source of ejection, is clearly displaced from the ionize
 gas (Fig. 7) (47). Also, there is no obvious point of divergence in 
 ionized gas near the center, so that it is difficult to invoke eject
 from a common point. Furthermore, there is -104 MQ of neut
 gas physically associated with the ionized gas. It is difficult to th
 of an ejection mechanism that would account for both the ioni
 and the neutral gas.
 Without a sustained source of UV photons, the electrons and io

 years, a time that is inversely proportional to the ionized gas densit

 Neutral gas. The spatial resolution of observations of the neutr
 gas near the center is limited, and the distribution of this gas is n
 nearly as well delineated as that of the ionized gas. The first cl
 idea of the overall distribution of the neutral gas within the cent

 infrared (28). The 50- to 100-uLm dust continuum is concentrated

 8), but the dust temperature is centrally peaked. This implies th

 Subsequent far-infrared spectroscopic observations show that t
 gas motion can be interpreted as rotation about the center.

 neutral gas is distributed just outside the ionized gas (48). M
 extensive observations of the rotational transition of CO J = 2 to
 J = 1 (where J is the angular momentum quantum number (49)
 have shown that the molecular gas is more extended and asymmetri-
 cally placed about Sgr A West than the far-infrared emission (Fig.
 8). This result suggests that the far-infrared emission arises predomi-
 nantly from the neutral interface between the ionized interior (Sgr A
 West) and a more extensively distributed cooler molecular gas (48).
 Although the bulk of the neutral gas is orbiting about the center in
 the normal sense of galactic rotation, the actual spatial distribution
 and motions are likely to be more complicated than those of a
 circularly rotating ring. In particular, a substantial amount of the gas
 displays noncircular motion.

 volume and amount to less than 100 Me of ionized gas. This
 ionized gas most likely originates outside the central 10 light-years,
 where there is a substantial reservoir of neutral gas. Clumps of
 molecular gas with low angular momentum fall in toward the
 bottom of the potential well. As they fall inward, they become
 tidally stretched into filaments and ionized by the central ionizing
 source.
 The limited extent and the high speed of the ionized gas imply
 that these filaments are very short-lived structures. In another 104
 years, the ionized gas will have a very different appearance. The
 transient nature of the ionized gas filaments suggests that the
 phenomena at the center are not in a steady state. For instance,
 events must have taken place > 104 years ago to evacuate the central
 region and to initiate the formation of the ionized gas filaments.
 Mass Determination from Motions of Gas
 Crawford et al. (50) have collated the body of velocity measure-
 ments of ionized and neutral gas at various radii from the center. By
 making the simplifying assumption that the gas velocities represent
 equilibrium circular motion about a spherically symmetric mass
 distribution, they infer that the mass density of the galactic center
 varies radially as r-27 between r = 0.3 and 30 light-years. They
 argue that such a mass distribution is much more centrally peaked
 than the star distribution inferred from the 2-puim observations and
 therefore suggests a central point mass.
 The inferred rapid decrease of mass density between r - 5 and 30
 light-years is based on low-resolution far-infrared observations of
 the velocity drop-off in the warm interface gas surrounding Sgr A
 West (50). However, this drop-off is not seen in observations of the
 cooler molecular gas that extends farther from the center (49), and
 the distribution of the neutral gas appears to be more complicated
 than the simple model of a rotating ring. Until higher resolution
 observations permit clarification, inferences on the mass distribution
 based on the neutral gas velocities are ambiguous.
 The ionized gas at the center is most likely falling into the central
 potential well. In this case, the motion is dominated by gravity and,
 in the absence of stellar velocity dispersion data, provides the best

 estimate of the mass distribution within the central 5 light-year
 particular, the presence of ionized gas at + 300 km/sec within
 light-year of the center suggests a highly concentrated mass distr
 tion, unless this high-velocity gas is expelled by a nongravitati
 mechanism.
 The best way of confirming the presence of a point mass is to
 demonstrate the Keplerian dependence of velocities at distances as
 close to Rsc as possible. The probe closest to the center is currently
 provided by the broad hydrogen and helium lines that are found
 within r - 0.3 light-year of the center. But, since neither the extent
 nor the velocity field of this high-speed gas has yet been well
 established, the implication for the central mass is unclear. If the line
 width is due to an outflow driven by radiation pressure, the
 observed total luminosity of 107 Lo from the center would imply a
 central mass of only - 300 MF (51).
 Until the distribution and motions of the gas at the center is more
 completely understood, the central mass distribution cannot be
 conclusively determined from the present observations of the gas
 velocities.

 dimensions as the underlying energy source, but it cannot be
 accounted for by any known stellar object. It is best explained as due
 to a massive black hole. The lack of measurable proper motion
 would also argue for a massive object. The only factor contributing
 to a lingering doubt is its low luminosity. Although this source can
 be powered by a neutron star in principle, there is no convincing
 model involving pulsars that can account for its observed properties.
 Furthermore, any such model would also have to explain why radio
 sources such as Sgr A* are not found elsewhere in the galaxy, since
 pulsars are distributed throughout. Sgr A* is the best candidate for a
 massive black hole.
 Further progress on understanding the radio source itself must
 await a proper map showing the details of its intrinsic structure. In
 the preparation of this map, it will be necessary to use the shortest
 possible wavelength. Given the transient nature of various phenom-
 ena at the center, it is not impossible that the radio source undergoes
 outbursts in which the peak luminosity exceeds that available from a
 star. Observations of such an outburst would eliminate the alterna-
 tive of a stellar energy source.
 The central few light-years of the galactic center have all the
 ingredients of an active galactic nucleus, albeit at a very modest level.
 The proximity of the galactic center to Earth has enabled us to
 delineate the complicated structure of the ionized gas in the central
 10 light-years and to view directly the paths of accretion of
 interstellar gas by our galactic nucleus. Sgr A West serves as a
 valuable illustration of the possible structure of the ionized gas in
 active galactic nuclei and of the way in which interstellar gas might
 be accreted by a massive black hole.
 The high obscuration of the center has prevented observers from
 obtaining a clear picture of how the stars are distributed relative to
 the compact radio source. The question of whether the compact
 radio source, if it has a large mass, has attracted a cusp of stars
 around it is not satisfactorily resolved (52). The structure of the
 central 0.5 light-year-the identification of the peak of the central
 star cluster (the dynamical center) and the source of the broad
 hydrogen and helium emission lines-remains to be clarified. High-
 resolution y-ray imaging is also needed to identify the extraordinary
 source of positrons.
 From the conservative but prudent scientific viewpoint, there is
 no conclusive evidence for a massive black hole at the galactic center.
 On the other hand, the extraordinary phenomena within the central
 1 light-year of the galaxy definitely call for something unusual. With
 the rapid development of novel techniques and the completion of
 various new space and ground-based telescopes, the next few years
 will be exciting times for understanding the intriguing center of our
 galaxy and for establishing whether a massive black hole is present.

 body of mass M and radius R is GMAmIR = (Rsc/2R)Amcz. For a neutron star,
 (Rsc/2R) - 0.15, which is the ratio of the binding energy released per unit rest
 mass energy. For a stationary black hole this ratio is 0.057, whereas for a maximally
 rotating black hole it is 0.42 (5). For nuclear fusion, the maximum ratio obtainable
 (converting hydrogen to iron, the most tightly bound nucleus) is 0.009.

 provides, among other information, a measurement of the "radial velocity" (the
 velocity component along the line of sight) of the source via the Doppler effect.
 The frequency or wavelength shift of the line relative to the laboratory value is
 directly proportional to the radial velocity. Hence in astronomy, line frequencies
 and line widths are often in units of kilometers per second. Positive values
 correspond to radial motions away from Earth.

 source, which is the Fourier transform of the source brightness distribution (that is,
 the image). This Fourier transform relation is the spatial analog of a similar relation
 between the temporal correlation of a wave and its power spectrum. Thus, the VLA
 maps typically require substantial efforts of computerized image processing after
 the observations which are made relatively quickly.

 Fusions of the secreted protein alkaline phosphatase to an
 integral cytoplasmic membrane protein of Escherichia coli
 showed different activities depending on where in the
 membrane protein the alkaline phosphatase was fused.
 Fusions to positions in or near the periplasmic domain led
 to high alkaline phosphatase activity, whereas those to
 positions in the cytoplasmic domain gave low activity.
 Analysis of alkaline phosphatase fusions to membrane
 proteins of unknown structure may thus be generally
 useful in determining their membrane topologies.

 react from within the lipid bilayer can directly identify membrane-
 spanning sequences (9). Spectroscopic analysis of purified mem-
 brane proteins can provide an overall measure of their secondary
 structures, which includes that of their membrane-spanning se-
 quences (10).
 In this article, we describe a genetic method to help determine
 membrane protein topology. This approach offers the advantage
 that it does not depend directly on the exposure and reactivity of
 amino acid side chains of the polypeptide, and should be a useful
 complement to the approaches which do.
 Rationale of the method. A protein spanning the cytoplasmic
 membrane of Escherichia coli will have different domains exposed to
 the cytoplasm and periplasm. Using fusions of such a membrane
 protein to alkaline phosphatase we have sought to distinguish these
 domains. Alkaline phosphatase appears to require export to the
 periplasm to show enzymatic activity (11). The idea underlying this
 approach is illustrated in Fig. 1 for a hypothetical membrane protein
 whose polypeptide chain crosses the membrane six times. If alkaline
 phosphatase were fused to a site normally facing the periplasm
 (fusion 1), it is possible that the alkaline phosphatase moiety would
 be exported to the periplasm and show enzymatic activity. Alterna-
 tively, if it were fused to a part of the protein facing the cytoplasm
 (fusion 2), the alkaline phosphatase moiety would remain cytoplas-
 mic and inactive. Thus, the activities of fusions at different positions
 would reflect the normal membrane topology of the protein.
 Tsr protein fisions. To test the scheme illustrated in Fig. 1, we
 have analyzed fusions to the E. coli Tsr protein, one of a set of four
 related proteins involved in chemotaxis as chemoreceptors. These
 proteins appear to exist as tetramers of a simple transmembrane
 structure in which each polypeptide chain crosses the membrane
 twice (Fig. 2a). Each polypeptide is divided into a periplasmic
 domain between the two transmembrane sequences, and a large
 cytoplasmic domain at the carboxyl terminus of the protein (Fig.
 2a). This structure is derived from the amino acid sequences of the
 proteins (12, 13), the properties of proteolytic fragments of one of
 them (14), the sites of covalent modification of one of the proteins
 react from within the lipid bilayer can directly identify membrane-
 spanning sequences (9). Spectroscopic analysis of purified mem-
 brane proteins can provide an overall measure of their secondary
 structures, which includes that of their membrane-spanning se-
 quences (10).
