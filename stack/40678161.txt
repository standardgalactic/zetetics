 A NEW RING GALAXY IN THE ABELL 1631 CLUSTER OF GALAXIES

 A new ring galaxy was discovered in the halo of a nearby rich cluster of galaxies, Abell 1631. Nearly on the minor ax
 of the ring, there is a companion galaxy which is apparently interacting with the ring galaxy.
 Key words: galaxies: individual - ring galaxy
 To clarify the nature of so-called polar-ring galaxies
 (Sofue et al. 1982; Mould et al. 1982; Wakamatsu and
 Arp 1983) and ring galaxies (Theys and Spiegel 1976), a
 survey of those two types of galaxies has been made for
 ten nearby rich clusters of galaxies. The list of the clus-
 ters appears in Wakamatsu and Arp (1983). The plate
 materials used are 1?5 square plates taken by A. Dressier
 with the 2.5-m duPont telescope at the Las Campanas
 Observatory. We report, in this note, the discovery of a
 ring galaxy in the halo of the Abell 1631 cluster of galax-
 ies (z - 0.053; Dressier 1980).
 The position of the galaxy is a = 12h48m27?l ± 0?2.
 S = -14°52'00" ± 3" (at the epoch of 1950.0). In Fig-
 ures 1 and 2, the ring galaxy is reproduced from a du-
 Pont plate (103a-O, 45 min.). Due to the small size of the
 object, the ring structure may be barely noticable on
 Figure 2. A bright nucleus having a diameter of 3'.'5 is
 located off-center in the ring. The west edge of the ring
 is slightly bright, which may be due to the presence of
 giant H il regions. Indeed, on the Palomar Sky Survey
 prints, the ring looks blue as compared with the red nu-
 cleus suggesting an occurence of an active star forma-
 tion. These are the characteristics which define the dif-
 ference between a ring galaxy and an early-type galaxy
 with an outer ring. Nearly on the minor axis of the ring,
 separated 1475 from the nucleus, there is a companion
 galaxy, which is about 1 magnitude fainter than the ring
 galaxy. Between them, a barely traceable faint bridge
 can be seen. They may be a physically interacting pair,
 although their redshifts have not yet been measured.
 The apparent magnitude of the galaxy is crudely esti-
 mated to be 17.5 ± 0.5 If the object is assumed to be a
 cluster member, its absolute magnitude becomes MB =
 -20.0 ± 0.5 on the scale H = 55 km sec"1 Mpc"1. The
 linear diameter of the ring is about 23 kpc, which is a typ-
 ical diameter of ring galaxies (Theys and Spiegel 1976).
 The location of the object in the cluster is at 3F = 2.6
 Mpc NE of the cD galaxy (NGC 4756) near the cluster
 center, i.e., in the halo region. This is consistent with
 Thompson's (1977) result that ring galaxies appear not to
 be concentrated to the cluster core, but to belong to a
 field population or to the cluster halo. Detailed spectro-
 scopic study is needed.
 The author expresses his thanks to Dr. A. Dressier for
 permission to inspect the duPont telescope plates.
