Abstract
The double copy procedure relates gauge and gravity theories through color-kinematics replacements,
and holds for both scattering amplitudes and in classical contexts. Moreover, it has been shown
that there is a web of theories whose scattering amplitudes are related through operations that
exchange color and kinematic factors. In this paper, we generalize and extend this procedure
by showing that the classical perturbative double copy of pions corresponds to special Galileons.
We consider point-particles coupled to the relevant scalar ﬁelds, and ﬁnd the leading and next
to leading order radiation amplitudes. By considering couplings motivated by those that would
arise from extracting the longitudinal modes of the gauge and gravity theories, we are able to map
the non-linear sigma model radiation to that of the special Galileon. We also construct the single
copy by mapping the bi-adjoint scalar radiation to the non-linear sigma model radiation through
generalized color-kinematics replacements.

INTRODUCTION
A surprising relationship between gauge theories and gravity has been shown to exist not
only for scattering amplitudes but also in more general cases. In the scattering amplitudes
context, an example of this relationship is the BCJ (Bern, Carrasco, Johannson) double copy
[1–3] which consists of applying color-kinematics replacements to the Yang-Mills scattering
amplitudes in order to obtain the scattering amplitudes of a gravitational theory involving
a graviton, a dilaton, and a two-form ﬁeld. In this case, there is a duality between the
color factors and the kinematic factors, since both can satisfy the same algebra. In the
cases where the double copy maps observables other than scattering amplitudes, the idea of
performing color-kinematics replacements persists, but the existence of an algebra satisﬁed
by the analogue of the kinematic factors has been scarcely explored. An example of these
duality satisfying kinematic factors in the classical context was introduced in [4]. Some of the
new cases consist of a classical realization of the double copy and follow two main directions:
exact results [5–13], and perturbative results [4, 14–22]. While the construction of the double
copy in the case of amplitudes relies heavily on the cubic structure (or rather the ability
to write the theory in a form in which there is a cubic interaction), in the classical double
copy this technical requirement is not always obvious. In the case of exact results, one starts
from the gravitational side with a solution in the form of a Kerr-Schild metric and applies
the corresponding color-kinematics replacements to obtain the single copy, i.e.., the gauge
theory analogue. Applying these replacements one more time leads to the bi-adjoint scalar
analogue, the zeroth copy. In the perturbative case, one can take the opposite direction
and start from the bi-adjoint scalar, then apply the corresponding replacements and obtain
Yang-Mills theory, perform this one more time and obtain the gravitational theory. Other
surprising examples of the double copy have been discovered in diﬀerent contexts—see for
example [23–29]. In this paper, we will focus on the perturbative implementation of the
classical double copy.
Such a procedure applies more broadly than between gauge and gravitational theories.
For example, by considering a “dimensional reduction” of the gauge and gravity theories
one can obtain the scattering amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model (NLSM) and the
special Galileon, respectively [30, 31]. The relation between these scalar theories and the
gauge and gravity theories can also be explained from another point of view: if we consider

Some examples of the Kerr-Schild double copy can be found in [5–13]. For examples of the BCJ
double copy, see [41–43] and references there in. Classical perturbative double copy examples are
found in [4, 17–21]. The dimensional reduction refers to that in [31]. Besides the relations shown in
this ﬁgure, there are other cases of relations between extended theories; some of these examples are
found in [44–46].
massive Yang-Mills and massive gravitational ﬁelds, the corresponding longitudinal modes are
described by the non-linear sigma model and the (special1 [30, 32–34] ) Galileon respectively
[35, 36]. This suggests the possibility of a broader relationship between these sets of theories.
Indeed, it has been shown that there is a web of relationships between their scattering
amplitudes [30, 31, 37–40], see Fig.1.
In this paper, we begin by analyzing the existence of a classical perturbative double copy
for the NLSM radiation. The setup consists of point-particles weakly coupled to pions which

decoupling limit is the special Galileon.

evolve consistently with the NLSM ﬁeld and whose deviations from their initial trajectories
and color degrees of freedom are small. We assume that the NLSM coupling to the point-
particles is invariant under the unbroken symmetry. This coupling is motivated by the fact
that the NLSM can arise as the longitudinal mode of a massive Yang-Mills ﬁeld which gives
rise to pion couplings invariant under the unbroken symmetry. Similarly, we assume that
the special Galileon couples through a conformal transformation which is motivated by the
coupling that would arise in the decoupling limit of massive gravity for the Galileons. In
addition to the double copy relation between these theories, it is also expected that one can
perform a color-kinematics replacement from the bi-adjoint scalar and obtain the NLSM
radiation as in the Yang-Mills case. Given this, we will also consider the zeroth copy case
where the point-particles couple to the bi-adjoint scalar ﬁeld, thus spanning the entire RHS
of Fig. 1.
The observable that we want to map between theories is the radiation amplitude at spatial
inﬁnity |⃗x| →∞. For example, the on-shell radiation amplitude for the bi-adjoint scalar φa ˜a
is deﬁned as
Aa ˜a(k) = y J a ˜a(k)

k2=0,
(I.1)
where the on-shell current J a ˜a(k)

k2=0 gives the ﬂux of energy-momentum, color and angular
momentum at spatial inﬁnity, and is deﬁned by the equations of motion □φa ˜a = y J a ˜a, with
coupling constant y. Similar deﬁnitions hold for the non-linear sigma model and the special
Galileon. In 4d, the probability of emission of a scalar can be written as [47]
dProb.(0 →φa ˜a) = |Aa ˜a|2 dk

As the observation time grows, T →∞, the diﬀerential radiated power is given by
dP
dΩd|k| =
Aa ˜a2
|k|2
2(2π)2 T .
(I.3)
The ﬁnal goal is to be able to map the scalar radiation power emitted by a set of point-
particles among diﬀerent theories. In order to do so, we will only need to map between
on-shell currents.
A.
Summary of results
In this section, we summarize the procedure for obtaining the classical double copy for
the radiation of scalar modes. We show that by applying a special set of color-kinematics
5

replacements, it is possible to transform the radiation ﬁeld generated by point-particles
interacting through a bi-adjoint scalar ﬁeld to the one in which these particles interact
through a non-linear sigma model ﬁeld. Similarly, one can act on the NLSM radiation ﬁeld
to obtain the equivalent object for the double copy, i.e.., the special Galileon radiation. We
consider the case where the impact parameters of the particles are large, and thus the particle
number is conserved, since no particles are created or annihilated. The large separation of
the particles accounts for the consistency of the perturbative calculation, a point that will be
made more precise in the body of the paper. A crucial fact for the existence of the double
copy is that the couplings of the scalar ﬁelds to the point-particles have the same coupling
strength as the self-interactions of such ﬁelds. This is similar to the case of Yang-Mills and
gravity.
For each theory, the point-particles carry diﬀerent degrees of freedom depending on the
couplings being considered. In the bi-adjoint scalar ﬁeld case, the point-particles carry two
color charges, ca and ˜c˜a , each in the adjoint representation of the groups G and ˜G. In the
case of the NLSM corresponding to the symmetry breaking pattern GL × GR →G (with G
the diagonal subgroup), we will consider a coupling to the point-particles that is manifestly
invariant under the unbroken symmetries. This means that the coupling will involve the
“covariant derivative” of the Goldstone modes, ∇µφa ≡f abc(U −1∂µU)bc, which in our case will
couple to the color dipole moment M aµ of the point-particles. Manifest invariance under G is
suﬃcient to ensure invariance under the full group GL ×GR [48]. Finally, the special Galileon
coupling we will be using follows from a conformal transformation gµν →(1+2π/Λ)gµν of the
point-particle action. This transformation is motivated by the one implemented in massive
gravity to remove the kinetic mixing between the helicity-2 modes and the longitudinal mode
before taking the decoupling limit, in that case Λ = MPl.
Because we have diﬀerent degrees of freedom carrying a color index in the bi-adjoint scalar
and the non-linear sigma model, we will also need a replacement rule to map one to the
other. Thus, for the single copy we need not only the usual color-kinematics replacements,
which schematically are of the form
˜C(˜c˜a) →˜N({q}) ,
(I.4)
but also the color-color replacements
C({q}; ca) →C({q} · M a) ,
(I.5)
6

where {q} stands for the collection of momenta involved in the process. At second order
in the couplings, the single copy color-color replacements are given by Eq.(IV.2) and the
color-kinematics by Eq.(IV.3). These replacements map the on-shell current Eq.(II.20) into
the on-shell current Eq.(III.25). At quartic order, the color-color replacements are given
by Eq.(IV.5) and the color-kinematics by Eq.(IV.7), these give a map between the on-shell
currents in Eq.(II.23) and Eq.(III.29).
For the double copy case instead we can simply perform a color-kinematics replacement
of the form
C({q} · M a) →N({q}) .
(I.6)
The replacement rules at second order are found in Eq.(VI.2), and the ones at quartic order
in Eq.(VI.4). These replacements create a map between on-shell currents: Eq.(III.25) maps
onto Eq.(V.15), and Eq.(III.29) maps onto Eq.(V.17). There are four main features that is
worth highlighting about these replacements:
1. Coupling constants: the coupling constants in the three diﬀerent theories are mapped
into each other as follows:
y →
√
2
F →1
Λ .
(I.7)
Thus, a result obtained in the biadjoint case with a precision of O(yn) will be mapped
onto an equivalent result for NLSM and special Galileon at order O(1/F n) and O(1/Λn)
respectively. For the sake of brevity, from now on we will denote this level of precision
as O(n).
2. Color charges: The color charges and dipole moments are mapped as
˜c˜aca →q · M a →1 ,
where q represents diﬀerent momentum factors, depending on the speciﬁc color structure.
This can be compared to the Yang-Mills-gravity case where the replacement is ca →pµ.
In this case, we are mapping between scalar theories so no new structure with a Lorentz
index appears uncontracted.
3. Three-point vertex: Color factors which involve only one structure constant are
mapped to zero,
f · c · c →0.

FIG. 2. Summary of color-kinematics replacements used in this paper.
In the gravitational double copy the color factor of the Yang-Mills three-point function,
f abc, is mapped to the color-stripped Yang-Mills three-point vertex. This is motivated
by the BCJ double copy where one replaces the Yang-Mills color factor by a second
copy of the Yang-Mills kinematic factor in order to obtain a gravitational amplitude.
In the present case, the NLSM does not have a cubic vertex and thus the above color
structure is mapped to zero.

This provides a new example of the color-kinematics duality at the classical level. The
analogue case for the gravitational double copy was studied in [4].

In the following, we carry out the perturbative calculation for each theory in detail. In
section II, we compute the bi-adjoint scalar radiation and in section III that for the non-
linear sigma model case. In section IV we then explain the color-kinematics and color-color
replacements that transform the bi-adjoint scalar result into the NLSM one. We continue in
section V with the calculation of the special Galileon radiation and in section VI derive the
color-kinematics replacements that lead to the double copy. We conclude in section VII.
II.
BI-ADJOINT SCALAR RADIATION
In this section, we compute the radiation ﬁeld produced by color charges coupled through
the bi-adjoint scalar ﬁeld. The O(2) result was ﬁrst computed in [18] and extended to order
O(4) in [4]. In the following, we show these results for completeness while clarifying some
technical details of the calculation.
The bi-adjoint scalar ﬁeld transforms in the adjoint representation of the group G × ˜G
and has cubic interactions, described by the Lagrangian

(II.1)
Our goal is to compute perturbatively the scalar radiation ﬁeld generated by a set of
color charges coming from inﬁnity, which will evolve consistently together with the ﬁeld
they generate. The point-particles carry color charges also transforming in the adjoint
representation of G × ˜G and move along the worldlines xµ
α(λ), where λ is the coordinate
along the worldline, and α labels the individual particles. These point-particles are coupled
to the scalar ﬁeld in the following way:

(II.2)
where the einbein η(λ) is a Lagrange multiplier that ensures invariance under reparametriza-
tions of λ, and ca and ˜c˜a are color charges transforming in the adjoint representations of G
and ˜G respectively. For the purpose of this paper, the speciﬁc Lagrangian realization giving
rise to the color charges is not relevant and thus is not considered here, but a discussion
regarding this can be found in [18]. The total color currents are

to J |O(2). The solid lines are the worldlines of the point-particles (which can carry color charge
degrees of freedom depending on the theory under consideration) and the dashed lines represent
the scalar ﬁeld.
where bµ
α are the (spacelike) impact parameters.
In what follows, we compute the solutions perturbatively in powers of the coupling strength.
The actual dimensionless parameter that controls the expansion is a combination of the
coupling strength and kinematic factors, given by [17]
ϵ ∝y2c2 ˜c2
E3 b ,
where E ≳m is the energy of the point-particle and b is its impact parameter. In this
expression we have neglected the phase space volume. Notice that the perturbation parameter
is inversely proportional to the impact parameter. This is consistent with our set up of
particles that are far apart from each other and which only experience small deviations as
they interact through the scalar ﬁeld. Indeed, the fact that ϵ ≪1 ensures that the deviations
are small compared to the impact parameter. We can now ﬁnd the O(1) ﬁeld

Notice that on-shell (k2 = 0) the ﬁeld vanishes unless kµ ∝pµ but pµ is timelike, therefore
there is no radiation at this order, as we should expect, since static point-particles do not
radiate. We now proceed to obtain the next order perturbation for the deviations of the

The above result for the source current heavily relies on the use of the delta functions in

perturbative solution in terms of Feynman diagrams. At second order in the coupling, the
contributions to the bi-adjoint current are given by the graphs in Fig. 3. The ﬁrst term

in the parentheses in Eq.(II.19) corresponds to the graph on the left-hand side of Fig. 3.
This graph only shows the case of the scalar ﬁeld radiated by particle α, but we should also
include the case where it is radiated from particle β. This is taken into account by the sum
over point-particles. The last term of Eq.(II.19) comes from the graph on the right-hand
side which corresponds to the self-interactions of the ﬁeld.
As we will see in the next section, the NLSM self-interactions will only contribute at next
to leading order in perturbations. Hence, in order to construct a satisfactory copy we will
compute the source current for the radiation ﬁeld for the bi-adjoint scalar at O(4). The

NON-LINEAR SIGMA MODEL RADIATION
Consider now the non-linear sigma model (NLSM) based on the simple compact Lie group
G; that is, the model corresponding to the symmetry breaking GL × GR →Gdiag, where
GL = GR = Gdiag ≡G. The leading order eﬀective Lagrangian is given by
L(2)
NLSM = F 2
4 Tr
 ∂µU∂µU −1
,
(III.1)
where U = gRg−1
L , and gR(L) is an element of the group GR(L). We will use the exponential
parametrization
U = ei
√
2
F φaT a ,
(III.2)
where φa are the Goldstone boson ﬁelds and T a are the generators of G. Given that the
pattern GL × GR →Gdiag is a simple generalization of the one describing QCD pions, in
what follows we will often refer to the NLSM ﬁelds simply as pions. Since all quantities with
a color index will transform in the adjoint representation, we’ll ﬁnd it convenient to follow
the conventions that are often adopted in the amplitudes literature (see e.g. [49–52]). Hence,
our generators satisfy the following relations:
Tr
 T aT b
= δab,
[T a, T b] = i
√
2f abcT c,
(T a)bc = −i
√
2f abc .
(III.3)
With this parametrization, the strength of self-interactions is determined by the coupling
√
2/F. In terms of the Goldstone ﬁelds, the Lagrangian can be rewritten as
L(2) = −∂φT · G(φ) · ∂φ ,
(III.4)
where we have deﬁned

(III.5)
In this case, we want to consider a coupling to the point-particle that preserves the un-
broken symmetry G, which means that it involves the pion covariant derivative ∇µφa ≡
15

f abc(U −1∂µU)bc. Consider a coupling to a dipole moment M a

(III.7)
From this coupling, we can read oﬀthe current generated by the color charges. Up to next

Similarly, we obtain the equations of motion determining the evolution of the dipole moment
from the conservation of the total color current

(III.10)
Here, Jµ, a
N. NLSM is the Noether current derived from L(2)
NLSM and reads
Jµ, a

A.
Perturbative solutions
We proceed to ﬁnd an expression for the radiation ﬁeld φa produced due to the interactions
of the point-particles. We will again assume that the point-particles are well separated and
that the impact parameters are large, so that we can construct a perturbative solution in
powers of the NLSM coupling. As in the previous case, the actual perturbation parameter is
a combination of the coupling strength and kinematic factors, given by
ϵ ∝1
F 2
E (k · Mα) · (k · Mβ)
bαβ
,
where k = O(E) and the dipole is M a ∝cad, where d ≪¯x is a measure of the size of the
point-particle. We start by rewriting the NLSM equation of motion (III.13) as
□φa =
√

F J a ,
(III.14)
where the source current J a is deﬁned as

contribution from the interactions between the point-particles and pions and the right-hand side
shows the contribution from the pion 4-point vertex.
Once we have the deﬂections at next to leading order, we can use them to compute the current
at O(4). There are two contributions to this current, one coming from self-interactions of the
NLSM and the other one coming from the coupling to the point-particles. The contribution

Notice that if we set M aµ = capµ then there is no radiation at any order. This is under-
stood by realizing that the coupling capµ∇µφa arises from the Yang-Mills gauge invariant

coupling capµAa
µ after introducing the St¨uckelberg ﬁeld. Since the starting point is a gauge
invariant term, when we introduce the St¨uckelberg ﬁeld we are simply performing a gauge
transformation and thus the physics does not change.
IV.
SINGLE COPY: BI-ADJOINT SCALAR TO NON-LINEAR SIGMA MODEL
So far, we have computed the radiation amplitude at order O(4) for both the bi-adjoint
scalar and the non-linear sigma model. It is now possible to identify the generalized color-
kinematics replacements needed to obtain the single copy. Since the color degrees of freedom
of the group G are diﬀerent in the bi-adjoint scalar and the NLSM, we need to perform
replacements to take the color charges to the color dipoles. Schematically, the color-kinematics
and color-color replacements that we use are
˜C(˜c˜a) →˜N({q}) ,
C({q}; ca) →C({q} · M a).
(IV.1)
From dimensional analysis we know that when transforming from the color charges to the
color dipoles for the radiation at O(3) we need to have a factor with mass dimension six on
the NLSM side. This is due to the discrepancy in the mass dimension of the couplings of
these theories. Considering this, we ﬁnd that the replacements are:
cα (cα · cβ) →−i 2
√
2 m4
αm2
β (k · Mα)(qβ · Mα) · (qβ · Mβ) ,

and
˜cα (˜cα · ˜cβ) →1 ,
(IV.3a)
˜f ˜a˜b˜c˜c
˜b
α˜c˜c
β →0 .
(IV.3b)
The fact that the terms involving one structure constant are set to zero can be traced back
to the fact that the non-linear sigma model cubic vertex is zero. Under these replacements,
we can see that on-shell:
ρa ˜a
αβ(k) →i 2
√
2 m2
αm2
β ρa
αβ(k) ,
(IV.4)
which implies that the radiation amplitude for the bi-adjoint scalar at O(2), Eq.(II.20), maps
to the radiation amplitude of the NLSM at O(2), Eq.(III.25).
20

In order to ﬁnd the mapping for the radiation at order O(5) we require color-kinematics
and color-color replacements for color factors involving contractions of ﬁve color structures.
In this case, the NLSM side should have mass dimension ten. These replacements are given
by

Under these, the on-shell current of Eq.(II.23) is mapped to the on-shell current of Eq.(III.29).
Note that, in the color-color replacements we see that the left side involves denominators
21

when the structure constants are present. These factors appeared due to the diﬀerence
between the equations of motion for the color charges, where an integration gives rise to
denominators, and the dipoles, which are contracted with momentum factors. There is also
an ambiguity in how to pick the splitting in the replacement rules since now we also map
the color factors to new color factors. By shifting kinematic factors from the color-color to
the color-kinematics replacements it is possible to ﬁnd a diﬀerent set of rules that give the
desired map between theories.

SPECIAL GALILEON RADIATION

term but it includes higher order terms in higher dimensions. The action for the special
Galileon is invariant under
δπ = c + bµxµ + sµνxµxν + 1
Λ6sµν∂µπ∂νπ ,
(V.2)
where c is a constant, bµ is a constant vector, and sµν is a traceless symmetric constant
tensor. As we mentioned previously, we assume that the special Galileon is coupled to the
point-particles through a conformal rescaling of the metric gµν →(1 + 2π/Λ)gµν. This is
motivated by the coupling that arises in the decoupling limit of massive gravity for Galileons.
Hence, the point-particle action is:
Spp = −

(V.4)
If we assumed that this interaction arises from the decoupling limit of massive gravity, then
the coupling strength would be 1/MPl. In this case, the couplings of the Galileon with
22

itself and with the point-particles would be suppressed by two diﬀerent scales, satisfying
the hierarchy Λ ≪MPl. The current calculation for the radiation amplitude will not hold
in this case since the leading terms would come from the self-interactions. We ﬁnd that in
order to identify the special Galileon as the double copy of the NLSM, the coupling with the
point-particles should have the same strength as the self-interactions coupling therefore we
assume the interactions in Eq.V.3. The equation of motion that determines the evolution of

VI.
DOUBLE COPY: NON-LINEAR SIGMA MODEL TO SPECIAL GALILEON
In the previous section we computed the special Galileon radiation at next to leading
order and previously we performed the analogue calculation for the NLSM. We are now in
position to propose the color-kinematics replacements that lead to the double copy. In this
case, the replacements are of the form
C({q} · M a) →N({q}) .
(VI.1)
Speciﬁcally, to transform the NLSM to the special Galileon at order O(2) we use the
color-kinematics replacements:
−i 2
√
2 (k · Mα)(qβ · Mα) · (qβ · Mβ) →1 ,
(VI.2a)
−i 2
√
2 f abc(qα · Mα)b(qβ · Mβ)c →0 ,
(VI.2b)
Under these replacements, we can see that on-shell:
ρa
αβ(k) →ραβ(k) ,
(VI.3)
and thus the radiation from Eq.(III.25) is mapped to that of Eq.(V.15). At O(4) we need
replacements for higher order contractions of dipole moments.
These color-kinematics
replacements are:
i 4
√
2 (k · Mα)a(qβ · Mα) · (qβ · Mβ)(qγ · Mα) · (qγ · Mγ) →−1 ,
(VI.4a)
i 4
√
2 (k · Mα)a(qδ · Mα) · (qδ · Mβ)(qγ · Mβ) · (qγ · Mγ) →−1 ,
(VI.4b)
i 4
√
2 (k · Mα)[f · (qγ · Mα) · (qβ · Mβ) · (qγ · Mγ)] →0 ,
(VI.4c)
i 4
√
2 (k · Mα)[f · (qδ · Mα) · (qβ · Mβ) · (qγ · Mγ)] →0 ,
(VI.4d)
i 4

2 (qγ · Mα) · (qγ · Mγ)fabc(q · Mα)b(qβ · Mβ)c →0 ,
(VI.4e)
i 4
√
2 (qγ · Mα) · (qγ · Mγ) fabc(q · Mβ)b(qδ · Mα)c →0 ,
(VI.4f)
i 4
√
2 fabcfbde(qδ · Mα)d(qβ · Mβ)e(qγ · Mγ)c →−2 n(γ, α, β)

i 4
√
2 fabcfbde(qβ · Mβ)d(qγ · Mγ)e(qα · Mα)c →n(α, β, γ) ,
(VI.4h)
where q represents either the radiated momentum k, or the momenta any of the ﬁelds,
such as qα. Under these replacements the NLSM radiation from Eq. (III.29) is transformed
25

into the special Galileon one from Eq. (V.17). While the color factors involving only one
structure constant are set to zero as a consequence of the lack of a cubic interaction in both
the NLSM and the special Galileon, the color factors involving two structure constants give
rise to a more interesting relation. The replacement in Eq. (VI.4h) exchanges the color factor
of the four-point amplitude of the NLSM (from the right-hand side diagram in Fig. 5) with
the corresponding color-stripped amplitude. Note that both the color and kinematic sides
satisfy the Jacobi identity even though none of the involved momenta {q} are on shell.
VII.
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
In this paper we have computed the amplitude of radiation emitted by point-like particles
coupled to a bi-adjoint scalar, a set of pions, and a special Galileon at next-to-leading
order in the couplings. While one might naively expect that the NLSM coupling to point-
particles should be of the form capµ∂µφa, this coupling gives rise to no radiation at any
perturbative order. This can be understood from the fact that this coupling arises from
the Yang-Mills gauge invariant coupling capµAa
µ after introducing the St¨uckelberg ﬁeld φ. A
similar situation happens for the special Galileon and the coupling pµpν∂µ∂νπ. Instead, for
the NLSM we consider a coupling to a color dipole moment, which is invariant under G, and
for the special Galileon we consider the coupling arising after the conformal transformation
gµν →(1+2π/Λ)gµν. These couplings are motivated by those that would arise for longitudinal
modes of massive Yang-Mills and massive gravity. Using these couplings we have shown that
up to next to leading order the double copy of the radiation of pions corresponds to the
radiation of special Galileons. We have also constructed the single copy starting from the
bi-adjoint scalar. To do so, we have used a generalized set of color-kinematics replacements
to map from color charges to color dipole moments. Compared to the gravitational double
copy, in the case of the scalar modes the simple replacement of the color structure by its
corresponding vertex arises for the four-point case, since there are no cubic interactions.
At the order to which we have worked, the special Galileon self-interactions do not
contribute to the radiation. It would be interesting to investigate the structure of the
color-kinematics replacement rules at O(8), which is where the ﬁrst contribution from these
interactions is bound to appear. Our expectation is that at O(6) the color structures involving
three structure constants will be set to zero, since these are related to the ﬁve-point vertex.
26

At even higher order, the color structures with four structure constants—corresponding to
the six-point vertex—will have a more complicated replacement rule, similar to what happens
in the gravitational case at O(4).
At higher order one must also contend with another challenge, namely the fact that
higher derivative corrections to the NLSM and special Galileon actions can contribute to
the radiation ﬁeld. This challenge is not limited to the classical double copy, since it is
far from understood what are the correct higher derivative corrections that give rise to the
amplitudes double copy relation [53–56]. Another question that would be interesting to
explore is whether it is possible to construct a wider web of classical color-kinematic relations,
in the spirit of [30, 38]. This web should include not only Yang-Mills, gravity, and the scalar
theories we have considered in this paper, but also other theories whose amplitudes admit a
CHY representation—e.g. Born-Infeld theory, Dirac-Born-Infeld theory, and others. We plan
to tackle some of these interesting questions in the near future.
