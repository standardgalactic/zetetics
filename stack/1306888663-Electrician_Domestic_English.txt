1.1 Safety Rules 
Fires in Electrical Circuits and Precautions: 
While working with electrical tools and equipment, chances 
are that there might be short circuit, which might further lead 
to fire. So it is important for you to know which electrical 
component holds what percentage of fire. 
According to the National Fire Protection Association, 
 
 
Lamps, light fixtures and light bulbs and fixed wiring 
have the largest share among the major types of 
electrical distribution equipment. 
 
Cords and plugs account for the largest share of 
civilian deaths. 
 
Many avoidable electrical fires can be traced to 
misuse of electric cords, such as overloading circuits, 
poor maintenance, and running cords under rugs or in high traffic areas. 
 
In urban areas, faulty wiring accounts for 33% of residential electrical fires.  
 
Fifteen percent of residential electrical fires start in the bedroom. Replace worn, old, or 
damaged appliance cords right away. 
  
1.2 Safety Precautions 
 Repair or replace the frayed cords on all electrical devices. 
 Never have extention cords across doorways or under the carpets. 
 Wall sockets and extension-cord receptacles with plastic safety covers 
are highly recommended in homes with small children. 
 Have additional circuits or outlets added by qualified electricians to 
avoid extension cords. 
 Always follow manufacturer's instructional manuals. 
 Never overload the outlets. 
 Always plug in one high-wattage outlet at a time. 
 If you feel that switches have become hot, shut them off. 
 When possible use cube tapes 
 Have smoke alarms installed to avoid accidents 
 
1.3 Safety Signs 
Safety Signs are crucial in any work environment. The primary importance of 
displaying Safety Signs is to prevent injury and ensure that all staff and visitors are well aware of the 
possible dangers and hazards in certain situations and/or environments. 
 
 
 
DO YOU 
KNOW? 
Electrical 
appliances 
should never be 
stored in 
cramped areas 
and must have 
enough space 
for breathing.

1.4 Fire Extinguishers and its types 
According to the Fire Industry Association [FIA], a survey has highlighted that rather than declining in 
importance, portable fire extinguishers have an even more vital role to play as a first aid response to 
fire. 88 percent of fires are now reported to be tackled with portable fire extinguishers. 
Here are different types of fire extinguishers: 
 
 Water Extinguisher 
 
3

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
7 
 
 
 
o A water extinguisher should only be used on Class A fires [Combustibles such as wood, paper, 
cloth, trash, and plastics].  
o If used on a Class B fire [flammable liquid of gas or paint; flammable gases, such as propane or 
butane], the discharge could help spread the flammable liquid or gas.  
o 
If used on a Class C fire [electrical equipment such as motors or kitchen appliances], it could 
create a shock hazard. 
 
 
Foam Extinguisher 
The foam extinguisher can only be used on Class A and Class B fires only. If used 
on Class C fires, it will create a shock hazard. 
 
 
 
 Carbon Dioxide 
o This type of fire extinguisher takes away the oxygen from a fire and removes 
the heat with a cold discharge.  
 
o The Carbon Dioxide fire extinguisher should be used on Class B and C fires. It is not effective on 
Class A fires. 
 
 
 Dry Chemical 
o The Dry Chemical Extinguisher removes the chemical reaction of a fire. In this 
category, the multi-purpose Dry Chemical extinguisher is the most used fire 
extinguisher of all extinguishers because it is effective on Class A, Class B and 
Class C fires.  
o This fire extinguisher creates a barrier between the oxygen and fuel elements on 
Class A fires. 
 
 
 Wet Chemical 
o The Wet Chemical Extinguisher extinguishes a fire by removing heat and preventing barriers 
between oxygen and fuel so that fire is not re-ignited. 
o Wet Chemicals are Class K [examples: cooking oils, greases, animal fat, 
vegetable fat] Extinguishers.  
o This extinguisher is a must-have if you are in the commercial cooking 
industry. Some Wet Chemical extinguishers can be used on Class A Fires 
as well.

 Clean Agent 
o The Clean Agent Extinguisher uses both halon and halocarbon by 
interrupting the chemical reaction component of a fire. The extinguisher 
is mainly used on Class B and C fires.  
o Larger Clean Agent extinguishers can be used on Class A, Class B, 
and Class C fires. 
 
 
 
 Dry Powder 
o Similar to the dry chemical extinguisher, dry powder separates fuel from 
oxygen or removes the heat element of a fire.  
o Dry powder extinguishers are used on Class D [combustible metal fires] 
only. They will not be effective on any other fire class. 
 
 
 
 Water Mist 
o The water mist extinguisher extinguishes a fire by taking away the heat 
element of a fire.  
o You should mainly use this extinguisher for Class A fires but it is safe to use 
the water mist extinguisher for Class C fires as well.. 
 
 
 Cartridge Operated Dry Chemical 
This extinguisher helps extinguish a fire by interrupting the chemical reaction of 
a fire and works by creating a barrier between oxygen and fuel on Class A fires. 
 
 
 
 
1.5 General Safety of Tools and Equipment 
Electrical work can't be done without the right tools. As basic tools have been improved over the years 
and new specialized tools are developed, the list of tool choices for electricians has expanded to a 
good extent. 
 
 
 
 
 
5

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
11 
 
 
 
Here is a list of tools: 
Tools 
Functions 
Pliers 
 
A small tool with two handles for holding 
or pulling small things like nails, or for 
cutting wire. 
Screwdrivers 
 
A screwdriver is a tool, manual or 
powered, for turning, driving or removing 
screws. A typical simple screwdriver has 
a handle and a shaft, and a tip that the 
user inserts into the screw head to turn 
it. 
Wire strippers 
 
A wire stripper is a small, hand-held 
device used to strip the electrical 
insulation from electric wires. 
Fishing tools 
 
Tape materials are suited to any type of 
job. Fish pole wire-installation tools 
facilitate wire pulling in drop ceilings, 
down walls or under raised floors. 
 
Measuring devices 
 
Laser measuring tools are becoming 
more popular, but no electrician's tool 
belt is without a basic tape for simple 
measurements. Those with rare earth 
magnetic tips that stick to iron and steel 
surfaces permit fast, one-person 
measurements. 
Labelling machines 
 
Properly labelling work at installation 
saves time when making moves, adds 
and changes, and handheld labelling 
tools speed up this important step. 
Power drills and drivers 
 
Every electrician uses drills, but the type 
of tool needed varies with the 
application-what is essential for one 
worker isn't necessarily needed by 
another. The power required depends 
on the material being drilled. 
 
 
6

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
13 
 
 
 
Power saws 
 
A power-saw makes use of a toothed or 
abrasive disc or blade to cut different 
materials using a rotary motion spinning 
around an arbour. 
 
1.6 How to treat a person who has been injured by an electrical shock? 
 
 
Electrical shocks always needs emergency medical attention, even if the person seems to be fine 
afterwards: 
 
a. Separate the Person from Current's Source 
To turn off power: 
 Unplug an appliance if plug is undamaged or shut off power via circuit breaker, fuse box, or outside 
switch. 
 
If you can't turn off power: 
 Stand on something dry and non-conductive, for example dry newspapers, telephone book, or 
wooden board. 
 Try to separate the person from current using non-conductive object such as wooden or plastic 
broom handle, chair, or rubber doormat. 
 
If high voltage lines are involved: 
 The local power company must shut them off. 
 Do not try to separate the person from current if you feel a tingling sensation in your legs and lower 
body. Hop on one foot to a safe place where you can wait for lines to be disconnected. 
 If a power line falls on a car, instruct the passengers to stay inside unless explosion or fire threatens.

b. Do Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, if Necessary 
When you can safely touch the person, do Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation if the person is not breathing or 
does not have a pulse. 
 
c. Check for Other Injuries 
 If the person is bleeding, apply pressure and elevate the wound if it's in an arm or leg. 
 There may be a fracture if the shock caused the person to fall. 
 
d. Follow Up 
 A doctor will check the person for burns, fractures, dislocations, and other injuries. 
 An ECG, blood tests, urine test, CT scan, or MRI may be necessary. 
 The person may be admitted to the hospital or a burn center. 
 
e. Call up for 108 for Emergency Disaster Management. 
 
1.7 Personal Protective Equipment 
PPE or Personal Protective Equipment protects the user against health or safety risks at work. It can 
include items such as safety helmets, gloves, eye protection, high-visibility clothing, safety footwear and 
safety harnesses. It also includes respiratory protective equipment. 
 
What can be done to ensure proper use of Personal Protective Equipment? 
 It is important that all personal protective equipment are safely designed and constructed 
 To encourage the workers, equipment should fit comfortable  
 When engineering, work practice, and administrative controls are not feasible or do not provide 
sufficient protection, employers must provide personal protective equipment to their workers and 
ensure its proper use. 
 
1.8 National Electrical Code 
The National Electrical Code describes the laid down norms of several Indian Standards dealing with 
all the aspects which are related to the practice od electrical installation. Several product standards 
also exist and compliance with relevant Indian Standards is desirable. Therefore we would recommend 
that every single part or section of the code must be read along with the relevant Indian Standards. 
Few examples of Indian Standards are:

 
The Trainer proceeds with the lesson after the Discussion. 
 
 
2.1 Basic Concept of Electricity 
Electricity is the flow of electrons from one place to another. Electrons can flow through any material, 
but it becomes more easily in some compared to others. It‘s easy flow is called resistance. This 
resistance of a material is measured in Ohms. 
 
Electron Theory 
Electron theory states that all matters comprised molecules, which in turn 
comprised atoms, which are again comprised protons, neutrons and electrons. 
A molecule is the smallest part of matter which can exist by itself and contains 
one or more atoms. 
 
 
 
 
Free Electron 
Some materials, such as metals, are good conductors 
of electricity; these possess free or valence electrons 
that do not remain permanently associated with the 
atoms of a solid but instead form an electron ―cloud‖ or 
gas around the peripheries of the atoms and are free 
to move through the solid. 
 
 
2.2 Structure of Matter 
The matter is divided into molecules, which in turn are divided into atoms. These 
atoms are composed of two parts: nucleus and periphery. In the nucleus of the 
atom, there are positive charged protons and neutrons, which as its name 
suggests, have no electric charge or are neutral. 
 
DO YOU 
KNOW? 
Electricity 
travels at 
6,696,000 
miles per 
hour.

Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
27 
 
 
 
Matter can be broken down into: 
 Conductors: In a conductor, electric current can flow freely. Metals such as copper typify 
conductors, while most non-metallic solids are said to be good insulators, having extremely high 
resistance to the flow of charge through them. 
 Semi-conductors: A semiconductor is a type 
of material that has an electrical resistance 
which is between the resistance typical of 
metals and the resistance typical of insulators, 
so it kind of, or ―semi‖-conducts electricity. 
 Insulators: Insulator can mean not only the 
material but things that are made of that 
material. They are made of various materials 
such as: glass, silicone, rubber, plastic, oil, 
wood, dry cotton, quartz, ceramic etc. The 
type of insulator will depend on the uses. 
Insulators have high electrical resistivity and low conductivity. 
 
Some more Important Terms: 
EMF: Making electrons flow through a resistance requires an attractive force to pull them. This force, 
called Electro-Motive Force or EMF, is measured in volts.  
 
 
Volt: The volt is the derived unit for electric potential, electric potential difference, and electromotive 
force. 
 
Power: As electrons flow through a resistance, it performs a certain amount of work. It may be in the 
form of heat or a magnetic field or motion, but it does something. This work is called Power, and is 
measured in Watts.

2.3 Cables and its Specifications 
All electrical cables consist of at least two conducting wires and an outer protective jacket. For medium 
to high power cables that carry high voltages, the conducting wires within the outer protective jacket 
may individually be enclosed in insulating sheaths. Electrical conductors are commonly made of 
copper. Synthetic polymers make the outer jacket and protective, insulating material. 
 
2.3.1 Coaxial Cable 
o A coaxial electrical cable has a copper-plated core, surrounded by a dielectric insulator. A woven 
shield of copper surrounds the insulating layer, which is finally wound by an outmost plastic 
sheath.  
o Coaxial cables differ in size, performance, flexibility, power handling capabilities and cost.  
o They are used to connect home audio and video equipment, television networks and components 
of a local area network. Hard line, leaky cable, RG/6, twin-axial, biaxial and semi-rigid are types 
of coaxial cables.  
 
 
2.3.2 Ribbon Cable 
o A ribbon electrical cable [also called multi-wire planar electrical cable or flat twin cables] is made 
up of multiple insulated wires running parallel to each other.  
o These parallel wires allow the simultaneous transmission of multiple signals of data. According to 
―Optical Communications Essentials,‖ a typical ribbon cable consists of four to 12 wires. It is 
commonly used to interconnect network devices.  
o Ribbon cables also connect the motherboard with other core CPU [central processing unit] 
components..

2.3.3 Twisted Pair Cable 
o A twisted pair electrical cable consists of pairs of insulated copper wires [that are colour coded], 
which are twisted around each other.  
o The diameter of each wire ranges from 0.4 to 0.8 mm, and the number of pairs vary in different 
types of twisted pair cables. The greater the number of pairs, the higher the resistance of the 
cable will be to external noise and cross-talk.  
o Twisted pair cables are easy to install, flexible and inexpensive. They are used for telephone 
cabling and to wire local area networks. 
 
 
2.3.4 Shielded Cable 
o A shielded electrical cable is made of one or more insulated wires that are collectively enclosed 
by an aluminium Mylar foil or woven braid shielding.  
o The shielding prevents the cable from external radio and power frequency interference, allowing 
the signal transmission to proceed smoothly. High-voltage power cables are commonly shielded.

2.4 Types of Wire Joints and Uses 
Knowing the different types and uses of electrical wire joints is critical to home repair and electrical 
maintenance. Joining wires incorrectly or without proper insulation can make the joint overheat, 
resulting in a potentially deadly fire. 
To complete any electrical joint, the practitioner must seal the exposed wires with electrical tape or 
another type of insulation. There are many types of electrical joints, but several are considered 
fundamental archetypes. These types of joints include the Western Union splice, tap splice and fixture 
splice. 
 
2.4.1 Western Union Splice 
The Western Union Splice is relatively simple and is one of the most common types of joints. This type 
of joint is used to connect two of the same conductor — repairing a severed wire, for example.  
 
 
Uses: 
 To make a Western Union splice, strip 5 inches of insulation from both conductors. Hold them in 
an ―X‖ shape, leaving 1 or 2 inches of exposed wire for each conductor above the intersection.  
 Wrap one of the exposed wires around the base of the other, then do the same with the 
remaining wire and conductor. 
 
2.4.2 Tap Splice 
o A tap splice connects a loose wire to a conductor in a perpendicular shape. This joint resembles 
a ―T‖ shape, with the connecting wire intersecting the running one.  
o Tap splices allow loose wires to tap the electrical flow of an active wire. 
 
 
18

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
37 
 
 
 
Uses: 
 A tap splice requires you to strip 4 inches of insulation from the connecting cord, and 2 inches 
from the running wire. Hold the two together like a ―T‖ and wrap the exposed wire of the 
connecting cord around the running wire once.  
 Continue to wrap the wire in the opposite direction of the first coil. This results in one loop on one 
side of the ―T‖ intersection, with the remaining loops [at least five] on the other side. 
 
2.4.3 Fixture Splice 
A fixture splice is mostly used to connect different-sized conductors, particularly those in electrical 
fixtures. This type of splice requires a pair of pliers or a similar tool. 
 
 
 
Uses: 
 To fashion a fixture splice, remove 4 to 5 inches of insulation from both of the wires. Clean them 
by scraping residue and remaining insulation from the conductor.  
 Hold one of the exposed wires right at the base of the other. Roughly half of the exposed 
conductor should be on each side of the intersection.  
 Grasp the intersection with the pliers and turn both wires simultaneously. Bend the coil towards 
the wires to complete the joint. 
 
2.5 Polarity Test in DC 
2.5.1 What is Polarity? 
Polarity means the direction of the induced voltages in the primary and the secondary winding of the 
transformer. If the two transformers are connected in parallel, then the polarity should be known for the 
proper connection of the transformer. 
 
19

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
39 
 
 
 
 
2.5.2 What is meant by Polarity test? 
Polarity in electrical terms refers to the Positive or Negative conductors within a DC circuit, or to the 
Line and Neutral conductor within an AC circuit. 
 
2.5.3 How to test polarity in DC? 
 Use a small DC motor.  
 ‗Calibrate' on a source of known polarity and mark the motor tab that gives clockwise rotation when 
positive.  
 Use a small electrolytic capacitor of higher voltage as the supply. If you connected it with the right 
polarity nothing will happen. 
 
2.6 Few Importance Definitions: 
1. Capacitor: A capacitor has two conductors which is separated by an insulator and is known as 
a dielectric. 
 
2. Capacitive Reactance: An opposition to the change of voltage across and element is known as 
capacitive reactance. It is inversely proportional to the single frequency or angular frequency, 
denoted by ω and the capacitance. 
 
3. Inductive Reactance: The variable opposition to current flow in an inductor is related to the 
amount of the inductance. The larger the value of inductance the greater the back emf effect 
produced. The opposition to current flow through an inductor is proportional to both the amount 
of inductance and to the frequency of the current in the inductor. This opposition to current flow 
is called Inductive Reactance denoted by [XL]. 
 
4. Impedance [Z]: The opposition to current flowing through a coil in an AC circuit is determined 
by the AC resistance which is also known as Impedance [Z], of the circuit.

5. Power Factor [pf]: The ratio of the real power flowing to the load to the apparent power in 
circuit of an AC electrical power is known as the power factor [p.f.]. The dimensionless number 
for power factor is in the closed interval of -1 to 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Trainees will be divided in groups of 4. Each group will be provided with chart papers having 
diagrams on wire joints. Trainees from each group will be asked to identify the joints and write 
down their functions. The group which does this best will be recognized. 
 The trainer will take the trainees to the laboratory where they will be provided with a set of cables. 
Each trainee will be asked to choose a cable from the lot and describe it accordingly. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Electrons can flow through any material, but does so more easily in some than in others. 
 Electron theory states all matter is comprised of molecules, which in turn are comprised of atoms, 
which are again comprised of protons, neutrons and electrons. 
 In a conductor, electric current can flow freely, in an insulator it cannot. 
 Insulator can mean not only the material but things that are made of that material. 
 All electrical cables consist of at least two conducting wires and an outer protective jacket. 
 Knowing the different types and uses of electrical wire joints is critical to home repair and 
electrical maintenance. Joining wires incorrectly or without proper insulation can make the joint 
overheat, resulting in a potentially deadly fire. 
 Polarity in electrical terms refers to the Positive or Negative conductors within a DC circuit, or to 
the Line and Neutral conductor within an AC circuit.

3.1 Ohm’s Law 
o Ohm‘s Law is a law stating that electric current is proportional to 
voltage and inversely proportional to resistance. 
o The potential difference [voltage] across an ideal conductor is 
proportional to the current through it. The constant of proportionality 
is called the "resistance", R. 2.  
o Material that obeys Ohm's Law is called "ohmic" or "linear" because 
the potential difference across it varies linearly with the current. 
 
 
 
 
3.2 Simple Electrical Circuits 
o A simple electric circuit contains a power source [battery], wires, and a resistor [light bulb].  
o In a circuit, electrons flow from the battery, through the wires, and into the light bulb.  
o In other words, it is the path that an electric current travels on, and a simple circuit contains three 
components necessary to have a functioning electric circuit, namely, a source of voltage, a 
conductive path, and a resistor. 
 
3.2.1 Series Circuit 
In a series circuit, the current through each of the components is the same, and the voltage across the 
circuit is the sum of the voltages across each component.

3.2.2 Parallel Circuit 
o A parallel circuit has two or more paths for current to flow through. Voltage is the same across 
each component of the parallel circuit. 
o The sum of the currents through each path is equal to the total current that flows from the source. 
 
 
 
3.2.3 Combination Circuit 
o It involves the dual use of series and parallel connections in a circuit known as compound circuits 
or combination circuits. The circuit depicted at the right is an example of the use of both series 
and parallel connections within the same circuit.  
o In this case, light bulbs A and B are connected by parallel connections and light bulbs C and D 
are connected by series connections. This is an example of a combination circuit.

3.3 Resistors 
o A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as 
a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal 
levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other 
uses.

3.4 Laws of Resistance 
The laws of resistance states that the Resistance ―R‖ offered by a conductor depends upon following 
factors: The resistance of conductor is the obstruction posed by the conductor to the flow of current 
through it. 
 
 
1. The Resistance ―R‖ is directly proportional with its length ―L‖ 
 
2. The Resistance ―R‖ is inversely proportional with its 
Cross Sectional Area: ―A‖ 
 
3. The Resistance ―R‖ is dependent on the Nature of 
the material. 
 
4. The Resistance ―R‖ is dependent on the Temperature 
of the conductor. 
 
 
3.5 Kirchhoff’s Law 
 
 
 
 
 
35

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
71 
 
 
 
3.5.1 Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law 
 Kirchhoff‘s Voltage Law or K.V.L. states that ―in any closed loop network, the total voltage around 
the loop is equal to the sum of all the voltage drops within the same loop‖ which is also equal to 
zero.  
 In other words, the algebraic sum of all voltages within the loop must be equal to zero. 
 
 
 
3.5.2 Kirchhoff’s Current Law 
Kirchhoff‘s Current Law states that at any node [junction] in an electrical circuit, the sum of currents 
flowing into that node is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of that node. 
 
 
3.5.3 Wheatstone bridge 
 A Wheatstone bridge is an electrical circuit used to measure an unknown electrical resistance by 
balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, one leg of which includes the unknown component.  
 One of the Wheatstone bridge's initial uses was for the purpose of soils analysis and comparison. 
 
 
3.6 Effect of Temperature on Resistance 
o The resistance of a conductor changes with the size and the chnaging temparature, as the 
temparature changes the dimensions of the conductor which in return expand or contracts. 
o The conductors increase their resistance with the increase in temparature. However, insulators 
are liable to decrease their resistance with an increase in temperature. 
o Materials used for practical insulators only exhibit a marked drop in their resistance at very high 
temperatures.  
o Therefore, the changes in resistance cannot be explained be a change in dimensions due to 
thermal expansion or contraction. 
 
 
 
 
 
36

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
73 
 
 
 
Temperature and Atomic Structure 
o The flow of current is actually the movement of electrons from one atom to another under the 
influence of an electric field.  
o Electrons are very small negatively charged particles and will be repelled by a negative electric 
charge and attracted by a positive electric charge. Therefore if an electric potential is applied 
across a conductor [positive at one end, negative at the other] electrons will "migrate" from atom 
to atom towards the positive terminal. 
o Only some electrons are free to migrate however. Others within each atom are held so tightly to 
their particular atom that even an electric field will not dislodge them. 
o The current flowing in the material is therefore due to the movement of "free electrons" and the 
number of free electrons within any material compared with those tightly bound to their atoms is 
what governs whether a material is a good conductor [many free electrons] or a good insulator 
[hardly any free electrons]. 
o The effect of heat on the atomic structure of a material is to make the atoms vibrate, and the 
higher the temperature the more violently the atoms vibrate. 
o In a conductor, which already has a large number of free electrons flowing through it, the 
vibration of the atoms causes many collisions between the free electrons and the captive 
electrons.  
o Each collision uses up some energy from the free electron and is the basic cause of resistance. 
The more the atoms jostle around in the material, the more collisions are caused and hence the 
greater the resistance to current flow. 
o In an insulator however, there is a slightly different situation. There are so few free electrons that 
hardly any current can flow. Almost all the electrons are tightly bound within their particular atom.  
o Heating an insulating material vibrates the atoms, and if heated sufficiently, the atoms vibrate 
violently enough to actually shake some of their captive electrons free, creating free electrons to 
become carriers of current. Therefore at high temperatures, the resistance of an insulator can fall, 
and in some insulating materials, quite dramatically. 
o In a material where the resistance increases with 
an increase in temperature, the material is said to 
have a positive temperature coefficient. 
o When resistance falls with an increase in 
temperature, the material is said to have a negative 
temperature coefficient. 
o Conductors have a positive temperature coefficient, 
whilst [at high temperatures] insulators have a 
negative temperature coefficient. 
o Different materials within either group have 
different temperature coefficients. Materials chosen 
for the construction of the resistors used in 
electronic circuits are carefully selected conductors 
that have a very low positive temperature 
coefficient.  
o In use, resistors made from such materials will have only very slight increases in resistivity, and 
therefore their resistance. Using such materials for the manufacture of resistors creates 
components whose value changes only slightly over a given range of temperature.

 In a series circuit, the current through each of the components is the same, and the voltage 
across the circuit is the sum of the voltages across each component. 
 A parallel circuit has two or more paths for current to flow through. 
 A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as 
a circuit element. 
 Kirchhoff's Voltage Law or KVL, states that "in any closed loop network, the total voltage around 
the loop is equal to the sum of all the voltage drops within the same loop" which is also equal to 
zero. 
 Kirchhoff's Current Law states that at any node [junction] in an electrical circuit, the sum of 
currents flowing into that node is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of that node. 
 Although the resistance of a conductor changes with the size of the conductor [e.g. thicker wires 
have less resistance to current flow than thinner wires], the resistance of a conductor also 
changes with changing temperature.

 Discussion: 
 
The Trainer will ask the trainees to jot down the important points that they have gathered from 
the video session. 
 
Once that is done, trainer will discuss the points with the trainees. 
 
The trainee with most number of correct points will be appreciated. 
 
 
4.1 Soldering  
 Soldering is the process of fixing one or more components as one by one by dissolving and 
running a solder in the joint.  
 The solder metal has a lower melting temperature compared to the working piece. They are in 
electrical and electronic projects, plumbing, etc.  
 Soldering process in various electrical and electronics projects is done by combining the 
components with the roots of the printed circuit board.  
 The circuit performance depends on the perfect soldering.  
 
 
4.1.1 Different Methods of Soldering 
The methods of soldering process are classified into two - soft soldering and hard soldering. 
 
 
Soft Soldering: 
o Soft soldering is a process for fitting very minute compound parts possessing low liquefying 
temperature, which have been broken during the procedure of soldering is performed at high 
temperature.  
o In this process, a tin-lead alloy is used as space filler metal. The liquefying temperature of the 
space filler alloy must not be less than 400oC / 752oF. A gas torch is used as a heat source, for 
the procedure.  
o Some of the examples of this kind of soldering metals include: tin-zinc for bonding aluminium, tin-
lead for general usage; zinc-aluminium for aluminium, cadmium-silver for power at high 
temperature; lead-silver for strength higher than room temperature, weakening confrontation, tin-
silver & tin-bismuth for electrical products. 
43

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
87 
 
 
 
Hard Soldering: 
In this type of soldering a solid solder unites two elements of metals by spreading out into the holes of 
the component that are unlocked due to high temperature. The space filler metal grips higher 
temperature more than 450oC/840oF.  
It comprises of two elements:  
 Silver soldering 
 Brazing soldering 
 
Silver Soldering 
o It is an unsoiled method supportive to fabricate small components, carrying out abnormal 
maintenance and built-up tools. It makes use of an alloy containing silver as a space filler metal.  
o Though silver provides a free running individuality, yet silver soldering is not suggested for space 
filling, and thus, different flux is recommended for accurate silver soldering. 
 
Braze Soldering 
o This type of soldering is a procedure for connecting two terminals of the base metals by forming 
liquid metallic space filler, which runs by the attraction of a vessel through the joints and cools down 
to give a solid union through diffusion and atomic magnetism.  
o It produces a very strong joint. It makes use of a brass metal as a space filler agent. 
 
4.1.2 Required Tools for Soldering 
The required tools for soldering includes soldering iron, solder flux, soldering paste, etc. 
 
         
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
44

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
89 
 
 
 
Soldering Iron 
o Here, soldering iron is the required primary thing, which is used as a heat source for liquefying 
solder. And 15W to 30W soldering guns are good for the majority of electronics or PCB [printed 
circuit board] job.  
 
o For soldering heavy components and cable, you 
require to spend on an iron of advanced wattage 
approx 40W or a larger solder gun.  
 
o The major difference between a gun and an iron is 
that an iron seems like a pencil and comprises of 
a pin-point heat supply for precise job, whereas a 
gun is like a gun in shape with a high wattage 
point excited by running electrical current simple 
through it. 
 
Solder Flux 
A flux is a chemical purifying agent. In soldering metals, flux provides three functions: it eliminates rust 
from the components to be soldered; it closes air out as a result ending extra rust, and by making easy 
mix improves dripping individuality of the fluid solder. 
 
Soldering Paste 
Soldering cream is employed to connect the leads of included chip packages to connection ends in the 
circuit blueprint on a PCB.

Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
91 
 
 
 
4.1.3 Step by Step Soldering Process 
The fundamental step by step procedure of soldering is executed by the following steps: 
 Start with the small components to the taller components and connecting wires 
 Place the element into the PCB, making sure it goes in the correct way around 
 Twist the leads a little to secure the part. 
 Make sure the soldering iron has warmed up and if required, use the moist sponge to clean the 
tip. 
 Place the soldering iron on the component of the pad and feed the solder‘s end onto the board 
 Take away the solder and the soldering iron from the board. 
 Leave the terminal to cool for a few seconds. 
 Using a couple of cutters neat the excess component terminal 
 If you make a mistake while heat up the joint with the iron, place the solder tip of your solder 
extractor and push the button. 
 
4.1.4 Soldering Tips: 
Soldering is the process that requires practicing the most. Soldering tips must assist you to become 
successful in your endeavour, and if anything goes wrong, you can stop practicing it, and get ready to 
do some serious tasks. 
 
Use Heat Sinks: Heat sinks are an essential for the connecting wires of sensitive apparatus namely 
transistors and integrated circuits. If you do not have a clip on this, then a pair of pliers is a superb 
choice. 
 
Clean the Iron Tip Neat: A clean iron tip indicates the conductivity of an improved heat and also a 
better joint. Make use of a wet piece of sponge to clean the tip among joint. Keep the tip of solder well 
tinned. 
 
Check the Joints: When complex circuits are being collected it is an excellent practice to confirm joints 
after soldering them. 
 
Solder Tiny Parts Initially: Solder jumper terminals, diodes, resistors and all other small parts 
previous to moving ahead to connect bigger parts such as capacitors and transistors. This makes 
assembling much easier. 
 
Connect Sensitive Components at the End: Put in CMOS, MOSFETs, ICs and other inactive 
sensitive parts at the end to avoid damaging them while connecting the other components. 
 
Use Sufficient Ventilation: Avoid breathing the smoke formed and make sure that the region you are 
operating in has plenty ventilation to put a stop to increase of toxic smoke.

CHAPTER - 5 
ALTERNATING CURRENT 
PRE-SESSION ACTIVITY 
49

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
99 
 
 
 
5.1 Alternating Current 
 In electricity, alternating current [AC] occurs when charge carriers in a conductor or 
semiconductor periodically reverse their direction of movement.  
 Household utility current in most countries is AC with a frequency of 60 hertz [60 complete cycles 
per second]; although in some countries it is 50 Hz.  
 The radio-frequency [RF] current in antennas and transmission lines is another example of AC.  
 
Waveforms 
 AC can come in a number of forms, as long as the voltage and current are alternating. If we hook 
up an oscilloscope to a circuit with AC and plot its voltage over time, we might see a number of 
different waveforms.  
 The most common type of AC is the sine wave. The AC in most homes and offices has an 
oscillating voltage that produces a sine wave. 
 
 
 
Other common forms of AC include the square wave and the triangle wave: 
 
       
 
 
Square waves are often used in digital and switching electronics to test their operation. 
 
 
50

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
101 
 
 
 
 
 
Triangle waves are found in sound synthesis and are useful for testing linear electronics like 
amplifiers. 
 
5.2 Circuit 
A circuit is a closed loop that allows charge to move from one place to 
another. Components in the circuit allow us to control this charge and use it 
to do work. 
 
There are two types of circuits: 
 Single-phase Circuit 
 
 Three-phase Circuit 
           
5.2.1 Single-phase Circuit: 
 It is a two-wire Alternating Current [AC] power circuit. Most people use it 
every day because it‘s the most common household power circuit and 
powers their lights, TV etc. 
 Supplies ample power to homes and small, non-industrial businesses. 
 Adequate for running motors up to about 5 horsepower. 
 
 
 
 
DO YOU KNOW? 
The first modern 
commercial power 
plant that used 
three-phase 
altering current 
was at the Mill 
Creek 
hydroelectric plant 
near Redlands, 
California in 1893. 
51

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
103 
 
 
 
With the wave form of single-phase power, when the wave passes through zero, the power supplied at 
that moment is zero. 
 
5.2.2 Three-phase circuit: 
 Common in large businesses, as well as industry and manufacturing. 
 Increasingly popular in power-hungry, high-density data centers. 
 Expensive to convert from an existing single-phase installation, but 3-phase allows for smaller, 
less expensive wiring and lower voltages, making it safer and less expensive to run. 
 Highly efficient for equipment designed to run on 3-phase. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Trainer will ask the Trainees to make a chart paper project where they will be asked to draw 
different types of circuits and explain. 
 The Trainer will divide the Trainees into a group of 2. The Trainer will ask each group to explain 
the concept of Alternating Current. The group that explains in the best manner will be recognized.

6.1 What is Electrical Earthing? 
 The method of connecting noncurrent carrying parts of the electrical equipment or the neutral 
point of the supply system to the earth through the wire having negligible resistance is called 
electrical earthing.  
 Earthing protects the electrical equipment from lightning strokes and earth fault conditions.  
 It provides the easiest path to the fault or leakage current to flow through it. 
 
 
 
6.2 Types of Earthing 
The electrical equipment mainly consists of two non-current carrying parts. These parts are neutral of 
the system or frame of the electrical equipment.  
On the basis of the earthing of these two noncurrent carrying parts of the electrical system, earthing 
can be classified into two types. 
o Neutral Earthing 
o Equipment Earthing 
 
56

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
113 
 
 
 
6.2.1 Neutral Earthing: 
 Neutral earthing is defined as the earthing of the system neutral to ensure system security and 
protection. Neutral earthing is called the system earthing.  
 In neutral earthing, the neutral point of the star-connected 3-phase windings of power 
transformers, generators, motors, and the earthing transformer is connected to the low 
resistance. 
 
 
 
6.2.2 Equipment Earthing: 
 Equipment earthing deals with the earthing of noncurrent carrying parts [frame or metallic body] 
of the electrical equipment to ensure the safety of personnel and protecting against lightning.  
 It also helps in earth fault protection. 
 
Plate type Earthing: 
o Generally for plate type earthing normal Practice is used 
o Cast iron plate of size 600 mm x600 mm x12 mm. OR 
o Galvanized iron plate of size 600 mm x600 mm x6 mm. OR 
o Copper plate of size 600 mm * 600 mm * 3.15 mm 
o Plate  burred at the depth of 8 feet in the vertical position and GI strip of size 50 mmx6 mm bolted 
with the plate is brought up to the ground level. 
o These types of earth pit are generally filled with an alternate layer of charcoal & salt up to 4 feet 
from the bottom of the pit. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DO YOU 
KNOW? 
The Earth 
carries a 
negative electric 
charge of 
roughly 500,000 
coulombs. 
57

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
115 
 
 
 
Pipe type Earthing: 
o For Pipe type earthing normal practice is used 
o GI pipe [C-class] of 75 mm diameter, 10 feet long welded with 75 mm diameter GI flange having 
6 numbers of holes for the connection of earth wires and inserted in ground by auger method. 
o These types of earth pit are generally filled with an alternate layer of charcoal & salt or earth 
reactivation compound.

Earthing is essential because of the 
following reasons: 
 Earthing provides the safety of the 
personnel from the electric shock. It 
ensures that the non-currents 
carrying parts, such as equipment 
frames are always safe at ground 
potential even though the insulation 
fails. 
 Earthing is essential for the safety of 
the equipment and personnel against 
lightning and voltage surges, 
providing the discharge path for surge arrestors, gaps, and other similar devices. 
 It provides the ground connections for the ground neutral system. 
 It provides a means of positively discharging and de-energizing feeders or equipment before 
proceeding with maintenance on them. 
 
 
Earthing can be done by electrically connecting the respective parts in the installation to some system 
of electrical conductors or electrodes placed near the soil or below the ground level.  
The earthing mat or electrode under the ground level have flat iron riser through which all the non-
current-carrying metallic parts of the equipment are connected. 
When the fault occurs, the fault current from the equipment flows through the earthing system to the 
earth and thereby protect the equipment from the fault current. At the time of the fault, the earth mat 
conductors rise to the voltage which is equal to the resistance of the earth mat multiplied by a ground 
fault. 
The contacting assembly is called earthing. The metallic conductors connecting the parts of the 
installation with the earthing are called electrical connection. The earthing and the earthing connection 
together called the earthing system. 
 
 
6.4 Earth Electrode Resistance Measurement 
The object of an earth electrode system is to provide a low resistance to foreign currents that may 
cause injury or damage or disrupt equipment. The currents will dissipate safely when properly 
conducted to earth via the electrode. There are three components to the resistance: 
 Resistance of the electrode materials and connections to them. 
 Contact resistance between the electrode and the soil surrounding it. 
 Resistance of the surrounding earth.

119 
 
 
 
 
 
The resistance of the electrode materials is purposely made small so their contribution to the total 
resistance is negligible. Generally, copper materials are used throughout.  
Ground rods usually are copper-coated steel for strength, although galvanized steel ground rods are 
found in applications where corrosion is a problem. 
Generally, the resistance of the surrounding earth will be the largest of the three components. An earth 
electrode system buried in the earth radiates current in all directions and eventually dissipates some 
distance away depending on the soil‘s resistance to current flow, as indicated by its resistivity.  
An earth electrode system consists of all interconnected buried metallic components including ground 
rods, ground grids, buried metal plates, radial ground systems and buried horizontal wires, water well 
casings and buried metallic water lines, concrete encased electrodes [Ufer grounds], and building 
structural steel. 
 
 
 
 
 The Trainer will conduct a quiz session by dividing the group of Trainees into two. The Trainer 
will then ask questions on different types of earthing and its purpose. 
 The group which answers or explains correctly will be declared as the winner.

8.1 Domestic Wiring 
 House wiring is defined as any wiring or electrical system used in a home or its surrounding 
areas. 
 The wiring process is fairly time consuming and requires planning for the varying power needs of 
electronics and appliances.  
 At home, the wiring system includes outlets, the main panel and meter base, and it is essential 
that all pieces are installed and function together properly to keep the home safe. With this in 
mind, hiring a professional is usually best to ensure that the process is completed safely. 
 
Wiring may be routed in any of several different ways. For example, the cable for a switch may run 
through a switch box and then on to the light, or it may run through the light to the switch box via a 
―switch loop.‖  
 
 
 
Other wires may run through either the switch box or the housing box or both, unswitched, on their way 
to powering different devices down the line. 
Types of Wiring: 
 
8.1.1 Parallel Wiring  
The wiring for most homes is parallel, meaning several devices are powered on a single circuit. Both 
the hot and neutral wires run through the various housing boxes along the route and branch off to 
individual fixtures and receptacles. 
 
 
 
 
82

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
165 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.1.2 Switch Wiring  
Switches, which are installed on hot wires, allow or disallow the flow of current to a light or other device.  
 
 
 
 
 
8.1.3 Series Wiring  
Series wiring routes the hot wire through several devices and then joins the neutral wire, which leads 
back to the source.

8.2 Components used in house wiring  
In case of new home construction, wiring for all electrical services can be 
easily installed before the walls are finished. In existing buildings, installation 
of a new system, such as a security system or home theatre, may require 
additional effort to install concealed wiring.  
 
Multiple unit dwellings such as condominiums and apartment houses may 
have complexities additional installation complexity in distributing services 
within a house. 
 
Services commonly found include: 
o Power points [wall outlets] 
o Light fixtures and switches 
o Telephone 
o Internet 
o Television, either broadcast, cable, or satellite 
 
High-end features might include: 
o Home theatre 
o Distributed audio 
o Security monitoring 
o Security CCTV 
o Automation 
o Energy management 
 
 
 
DO YOU 
KNOW? 
Coal is the 
world‘s biggest 
source of 
energy for 
producing 
electricity.

 Power and telecommunication services generally require entry points into the home and a 
location for connection equipment.  
 For electric power supply, a cable is run either overhead or underground into a distribution 
board in the home.  
 A distribution board, or circuit breaker panel, is typically a metal box mounted on a wall of the 
home. In many new homes, the location of the electrical switchboard is on the outside of the 
external wall of the garage. 
 How services are connected will vary depending on the service provider and location of the 
home. 
 
8.2.1 Wiring Basics 
 Wiring a residence requires the use of three different colours of wires in addition to a bare ground 
wire. The bare wire serves as the ground and doesn‘t transfer any power. This is the wire that will 
trip the circuit breaker in the event of a short circuit and eliminate any electrical current moving to 
the device.  
 Both black and red wires are called ―hot‖ wires in the industry and carry current from the breaker 
to the appliance.  
 White wires hold current taking the opposite path, from the appliance to the breaker and are 
called ―returns.‖ A 14-2 gauge wire is the minimum in most areas, but 12-2 is preferable. This is a 
thicker gauge wire that will handle more power, which means reduced chance of tripping a circuit. 
In fact, this additional power is an ideal choice for homes that have many appliances or electrical 
devices that will that run simultaneously. 
 
8.2.2 Wiring Tools and Accessories 
When it comes to electrical projects, large or small, having the right tools for the job makes the project 
a lot easier and potentially safer.  
While there are numerous specialty electrical tools available, some are a must-have in the electrical 
toolbox.

 Personal protective equipment [PPE] 
Personal protective equipment [PPE] refers to protective clothing, helmets, goggles, or other 
garments or equipment designed to protect the wearer's body from injury or infection. 
 
 Circuit Testers 
You need to have a voltage tester of some type for electrical work, and one that you trust is 
working properly. The important thing is to ensure that it is working so you can verify that you 
have the power off on any circuit you may be working with. Check it on a known live source 
before trusting it to determine if your circuit is dead. 
 
 Screwdrivers 
It is essential to have a good quality set of screwdrivers. It is best to purchase them in a complete 
set rather than individually, as this will save you money, and increase the chances that you will 
have the driver that best fits the need. 
A basic set of screwdrivers should include the 3 main types of screwdriver heads. 
1.  The Standard blade tip 
2.  The Phillips tip 
3.  The recessed square shank or Robertson tip 
 
You need at least two sizes of each, but a full set would include: 
o Standard blade 
o Phillips Tip 
o Square Recess Tip [Robertson] 
 
 Cordless Screwdriver/Drill 
If you are going to take on any project beyond the most basic of jobs, such as, for example, 
changing out an individual receptacle or switch, you should have a good cordless drill and driver 
tool, along with a complete set of screwdriver bits and drill bits. This will save you a lot of time 
and when used properly, a power driver can be used in place of a screwdriver for most jobs. 
 
 Electric Drill 
For larger projects, with a lot of drilling required, [wood studs, etc.], an electric drill is more 
practical. Using rechargeable batteries, these drills are available with similar features to an AC 
mains-powered drill. They are available in the hammer drill configuration and most have a clutch, 
which aids in driving screws into various substrates while not damaging them. 
 
 Knife 
You will need to have a good knife, and I prefer a standard utility knife, stripping large gauge wire, 
and for many other jobs as well. 
 
86

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
173 
 
 
 
 Wire Strippers 
Have a good quality wire stripper. I prefer a T-Stripper with a wire cutter, light-duty plier nose, and 
holes for bending termination loops on wires for most home electrical work. A combination 
crimper, cutter, stripper, bolt cutter and more, like those found in automotive electrical repair kits 
can be very handy as well, but the multi-purpose aspect means that the wire stripping function is 
compromised. 
 
 Lineman’s Plier 
A lineman‘s plier, or a bull nose plier with a wire cutter, and at least 8″or 9″ handles is also an 
essential part of the electrical tool list. We use these for cutting, bending, twisting wires, etc. 
 
 Diagonal Pliers 
Also known as side-cutters, a standard duty diagonal plier should also be a part of your kit. 
 
 Hammer 
Have a good quality, 16oz. claw hammer. You will need this for driving staples, nails, etc. 
 
 Nut Drivers 
A good set of nut drivers is not essential, but come in very handy for certain jobs where a wrench 
or a socket set isn‘t practical. 
 
 Tape Measure 
Have a good quality, locking tape measure and a 25‘length, 1″ blade is maybe over-kill, but will 
come in handy for other projects around the home. 
 
 Pump Pliers 
These are very handy, and essential if you are working with conduit, such as EMT, flexible 
conduit, or teck cable. 
 
 Pipe Wrench 
It would be essential if you are working with conduit, especially rigid or EMT conduit. 
 
 Electrical Tape 
Every electrical tool kit should have at least a roll of black electrical tape, and having a few 
colours like red and blue helps as well for identifying wires, etc. 
 
 Duct Tape 
Every tool kit, electrical or otherwise, must have the universal repair tool that is a roll of duct tape!

175 
 
 
 
 Bandages 
No matter how careful you are, accidents happen. Just do all you can to protect yourself and 
minimize the potential for injury. Have a first aid kit handy, in case of any emergency. 
 
 Keyhole saw 
Great for cutting out openings for outlet boxes in drywall, panelboard, etc. 
 
 Hacksaw 
A saw with a narrow fine-toothed blade set in a frame, used especially for cutting metal. 
 
 Power Saw  
For cutting studs, blocking and reinforcing boxes, etc. 
 
 Wood Chisel 
One uses it when working with wood construction. 
 
 Conduit Bender 
If working with conduit, you will need a hickey bender or any bending tool designed for the 
conduit you are working with. 
 
 Fish Tape, and/or Fishing Tools 
A fish tape is very handy, and essential if working with conduit. A fish tape or fishing tools  are 
required if you are installing electrical in existing walls or ceilings and are trying to minimize the 
damage you may cause by cutting as few  access holes as possible. 
 
 Flashlight/Headlamp 
For when you need some extra light for dark places, or when the power is off while working on 
existing systems.

8.3 What is Megger 
 Insulation resistance quality of an electrical system degrades with time, environment condition i.e. 
temperature, humidity, moisture and dust particles.  
 It also gets impacted negatively due to the presence of electrical and mechanical stress, so it‘s 
become very necessary to check the IR [Insulation resistance] of equipment at a constant regular 
interval to avoid any measure fatal or electrical shock.  
 
 
 
8.3.1 Uses of Megger 
 Megger enables us to measure electrical leakage in wire, results are very reliable as we shall be 
passing electric current through device while we are testing. 
 The equipment is basically used for verifying the electrical insulation level of any device such as 
motor, cable, generator winding, etc.  
 This is a very poplar test being carried out since very long back. Not necessary it shows us exact 
area of electrical puncture but shows the amount of leakage current and level of moisture within 
electrical equipment/winding/system. 
 
8.3.2 Categories of Megger 
Megger can be separated into mainly two categories: 
 Electronic Type [Battery Operated] 
 Manual Type [Hand Operated] 
 
 
 
 
 
90

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
181 
 
 
 
Electronic Type Megger and its Specifications: 
1) Digital Display: A digital display to show IR value in 
digital form. 
2) Wire Leads: Two numbers of wire leads for 
connecting megger with electrical external system to 
be tested. 
3) Selection Switches: Switches use to select 
electrical parameters ranges. 
4) Indicators: To indicate various parameters status 
i.e. On-Off. For Example, Power, hold, Warning etc. 
 
 
 
Manual Type Megger and its Specifications: 
1) Analog display provided on front face of tester for IR value recording. 
2) Hand crank used to rotate helps to achieve desired RPM required generate voltage which runs 
through electrical system.  
3) Wire Leads - Used same as in electronic tester i.e. For connecting tester with electrical system. 
 
 
8.3.3 Advantages of Electronic Type Megger: 
 Level of accuracy is very high. 
 IR value is digital type, easy to read. 
 One person can operate very easily. 
 Works perfectly even at very congested space. 
 Very handy and safe to use. 
 
 
 
 
 
8.3.4 Advantages of Hand Operated Megger: 
 Still keeps important in such high-tech world as it‘s an oldest method for IR value determination. 
 No external source required to operate. 
 Cheaper available in market.

8.4 Construction of Megger 
The circuit construction features of megger are as follows: 
 Deflecting and Control coil: Connected parallel to the generator, mounted at right angle to each 
other and maintain polarities in such a way to produced torque in opposite direction. 
 Permanent Magnets: Produce magnetic field to deflect pointer with North-South pole magnet. 
 Pointer: One end of the pointer connected with coil another end deflects on scale from infinity to 
zero. 
 Scale: A scale is provided in front-top of the megger from range ‗zero‘ to ‗infinity‘, enable us to 
read the value. 
 D.C generator or Battery connection: Testing voltage is produced by hand operated DC 
generator for manual operated Megger. Battery / electronic voltage charger is provided for 
automatic type Megger for same purpose. 
 Pressure coil resistance and Current coil resistance: Protect instrument from any damage 
because of low external electrical resistance under test. 
 
 
8.5 Working Principle of Megger 
Voltage for testing produced by hand operated megger by rotation of crank in case of hand operated 
type, a battery is used for electronic tester. 
 500 Volt DC is sufficient for performing test on equipment range up to 440 Volts. 
 1000 V to 5000 V is used for testing for high voltage electrical systems. 
 Deflecting coil or current coil connected in series and allows flowing the electric current taken by 
the circuit being tested. 
 The control coil also known as pressure coil is connected across the circuit. 
 Current limiting resistor [CCR and PCR] connected in series with control and deflecting coil to 
protect damage in case of very low resistance in external circuit. 
 In hand operated megger electromagnetic induction effect is used to produce the test voltage i.e. 
armature arranges to move in permanent magnetic field or vice versa. 
 Where as in electronic type megger battery are used to produce the testing voltage. 
 As the voltage increases in external circuit, the deflection of pointer increases and deflection of 
pointer decreases with the increase in current. 
 Hence, resultant torque is directly proportional to voltage and inversely proportional to current. 
 When electrical circuit being tested is open, torque due to voltage coil will be maximum and 
pointer shows ‗infinity‘ means no shorting throughout the circuit and has maximum resistance 
within the circuit under test. 
 If there is short circuit pointer shows ‗zero‘, which means ‗NO‘ resistance within circuit being 
tested.

8.7 Use of Test Lamps 
 The test light is an electric lamp connected with one or two insulated wire leads. Often, it takes 
the form of a screwdriver with the lamp connected between the tip of the screwdriver and a single 
lead that projects out the back of the 
screwdriver.  
 By connecting the flying lead to an earth 
[ground] reference and touching the screwdriver 
tip to various points in the circuit, the presence 
or absence of voltage at each point can be 
determined, allowing 
simple faults to 
be 
detected and traced to their root cause.  
 For higher voltages, a statiscope consisting of a 
neon glow tube mounted on a long insulating 
handle can be used to detect AC voltages of 
2000 volts or more. 
 For 
low 
voltage 
work 
[for 
example, 
in automobiles], the lamp used is usually a 
small, low-voltage incandescent light bulb. These lamps usually are designed to operate on 
approximately 12 V; application of an automotive test lamp on mains voltage will destroy the lamp 
and may cause a short-circuit fault in the tester. 
 For line voltage [mains] work, the lamp is usually a small neon lamp connected in series with an 
appropriate ballast resistor. These lamps often can operate across a wide range of voltages from 
90V up to several hundred volts.  
 In some cases, several separate lamps are used with resistive voltage dividers arranged to allow 
additional lamps to strike as the applied voltage rises higher. The lamps are mounted in order 
from lowest voltage to highest, this minimal bar graph providing a crude indication of voltage. 
 Incandescent bulbs may also be used in some electronic equipment repair, and a trained 
technician can usually tell the approximate voltage by using the brightness as a crude indicator. 
 Neon-lamp type tester, which has no amplifier; this type requires a direct metallic contact to the 
circuit to be tested. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Trainer will bring a handful of domestic wiring tools and distribute among the Trainees. Each 
trainee will hold the tools at random and state the function of that particular tool.  
 The Trainer will bring a Megger. The Trainees will then be divided into groups of 2. The Trainer 
will then ask any 2 members of each group to describe its working principle in detail.

 In a home, the wiring system includes outlets, the main panel and meter base, and it is essential 
that all pieces are installed and function together properly to keep the home safe. 
 The wiring for most homes is parallel, meaning several devices are powered on a single circuit. 
 Multiple unit dwellings such as condominiums and apartment houses may have complexities 
additional installation complexity in distributing services within a house. 
 When it comes to electrical projects, large or small, having the right tools for the job makes the 
project a lot easier and potentially safer. 
 Every electrical tool kit should have at least a roll of black electrical tape, and having a few 
colours like red and blue helps as well for identifying wires, etc. 
 Megger enables us to measure electrical leakage in wire, results are very reliable as we shall be 
passing electric current through device while we are testing. 
 One of the advantages of Electronic Type Megger is that its level of accuracy is too high. 
 For higher voltages, a statiscope consisting of a neon glow tube mounted on a long insulating 
handle can be used to detect AC voltages of 2000 volts or more.

9.1 Fuse 
 Fuse is an electronic device, which is used to protect circuits from over current, overload and 
make sure the protection of the circuit. There are many types of fuses available in the market, but 
function of all these fuses is same. 
 Fuse consists of a low resistance metallic wire enclosed in a non-combustible material.  
 Whenever a short circuit, over current or mismatched load connection occurs, then the thin wire 
inside the fuse melts because of the heat generated by the heavy current flowing through it. 
Therefore, it disconnects the power supply from the connected system.  
 In normal operation of the circuit, fuse wire is just a very low resistance component and does not 
affect the normal operation of the system connected to the power supply. 
 
 
 
9.1.1 Types of Fuse in Terms of Input Supply Voltage 
There are different types of fuses available in the market and they can be categories on the basis of 
Different aspects.  
Fuses can be divided into two main categories according to the type of input supply voltage. 
1. AC fuses 
2. DC fuses 
 
AC and DC Fuse: 
 There is a little difference between AC and DC Fuses used in the AC and DC Systems. In a DC 
system, when the metallic wire Melts because of the heat generated by the over current, then Arc 
is produced and it is very difficult to extinct this arc because of DC constant value.  
 Therefore, in order to minimize the fuse arcing, DC fuse are little bigger than an AC fuse which 
increase the distance between the electrodes to reduce the arc in the Fuse.  
 In the AC system, voltage with 60Hz or 50Hz frequency changes it amplitude from zero to 60 
times every second, so AC can be extinct easily as compared to DC. Therefore, AC fuses are 
little bit small in sizes as compared to DC fuses.  
99

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
199 
 
 
 
9.1.2 Types of Fuse in terms of One Time or Multiple Operations  
 One time use only Fuse                   
One time use fuses contain a metallic wire, which burns out, when an over current, over load or 
mismatched load connect event occur, user has to manually replace these fuses, switch fuses 
are cheap and widely used in almost all the electronics and electrical systems. 
 
 
Such types of fuses can be categorised on the following basis: 
 Current carrying Capacity of Fuse 
 Breaking capacity 
  I2t value of Fuse 
 Response Characteristic 
 Rated voltage of Fuse 
 Packaging Size 
 
 
 Fuse Current Carrying Capacity 
Current carrying capacity is the amount of current which a fuse can easily conduct without 
interrupting the circuit. 
 
 
Breaking capacity 
The value of maximum current that can safely be interrupted by the Fuse 
is called Breaking Capacity and should be higher than the prospective 
short circuit current. 
 
 
I2t value of Fuse 
The I2t terms related to fuse normally used in short 
circuit condition. It is the amount of energy which 
carries the fuse element when the electrical fault is 
cleared by fuse element. 
 
 Response Characteristic 
The speed at which fuse blows, depend on the amount of current flowing 
through its wire. The higher the current flowing through the wire, faster will 
be the response time.  
Response characteristic shows the response time for over current event. 
Fuses which respond rapidly to the over current situation is called ultra-fast 
fuses or Fast fuses. They are used in many semiconductor devices 
because semiconductor devices damaged by over current very rapidly. 
 
 
DO YOU 
KNOW? 
The voltages 
generated by 
your body are 
no greater than 
0.1 volts 
100

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
201 
 
 
 
 Rated Voltage of Fuse: 
Each fuse has maximum allowed voltage rating, for example, if a fuse is designed for 32 volts it 
cannot be used with 220 volts, different amount of isolation is required in different fuses working 
on different voltage levels. 
 
 Packaging size: 
As we have mentioned above that AC and DC fuses, have a little bit different packaging type, in 
the same way different application requires different packages to be used accurately in the circuit. 
Other factors and parameters are marking, temperature derating, voltage drop and speed. 
 
9.1.3 Other Types of Fuses: 
 Cartridge fuses: 
o Cartridge fuses are used to protect electrical appliances such as motors air-conditions, 
refrigerator, pumps etc, where high voltage rating and currents required.  
o They are available up to 600A and 600V AC and widely used in industries, commercial as well 
as home distribution panels. 
 
There are two types of Cartridge fuses.  
1. General purpose fuse with no time delay   
2. Heavy-duty cartridge fuses with time delay.  
Both are available in 250V AC to 600V AC and its rating can be found on the end cap or knife blade. 
 
 
 Blade Type fuses: 
This type of fuses [also known as spade or plug-in fuses] comes in plastic body and two metal 
caps to fit in the socket. Mostly, they used in automobiles for wiring and short circuit protection.

Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
203 
 
 
 
9.1.4 HRC Fuse [High Rupturing Capacity Fuse] and its Types: 
 This type of fuse contains a fuse wire in it, which carries the short circuit current safely for a given 
time period. During this period, if fault is removed, then it does not blow off otherwise it will melt 
and remove the circuit from electrical supply hence, the circuit remains safe. 
 The common material, which is used to make an HRC fuse is glass. However, this is not always 
the case. Other chemical compounds are also used in HRC fuse manufacturing and construction 
based on different factors.  
 Its external enclosure is made fully airtight in order to avoid the effect of atmosphere on the fuse 
materials. The major objection on HRC fuse is low and uncertain breaking capacity of semi-
enclosed fuse. 
 
Types of HRC fuse: 
o NH Fuse 
o Din type 
o Blade contact 
 
9.1.5 Typical Uses and Applications of fuses: 
Electronic Fuses can be used in all types of electrical and electronic applications including: 
 Motors 
 Air-conditions 
 Home distribution boards 
 General electrical appliances and devices 
 Laptops 
 Cell phones 
 Game systems 
 Printers 
 Digital cameras 
 DVD players 
 Portable Electronics 
 LCD monitors 
 Scanners 
 Battery packs 
 Hard disk drives 
 Power convertors

9.1.6 Relays 
 A relay is an electromagnetic switch operated by a relatively small electric current that can turn 
on or off a much larger electric current. 
  The heart of a relay is an electromagnet [a coil of wire that becomes a temporary magnet when 
electricity flows through it]. You can think of a relay as a kind of electric lever: switch it on with a 
tiny current and it switches on ["leverages"] another appliance using a much bigger current.  
 As the name suggests, many sensors are incredibly sensitive pieces of electronic equipment and 
produce only small electric currents. But often we need them to drive bigger pieces of apparatus 
that use bigger currents.  
 Relays bridge the gap, making it possible for small currents to activate larger ones. That means 
relays can work either as switches [turning things on and off] or as amplifiers [converting small 
currents into larger ones]. 
 
  
 
 
 
9.1.6.1 Relays in practice 
Suppose you want to build an electronically operated cooling system that switches a fan on or off as 
your room temperature changes. You could use some kind of electronic thermometer circuit to sense 
the temperature, but it would produce only small electric currents—far too tiny to power the electric 
motor in a great big fan.  
Instead, you could connect the thermometer circuit to the input circuit of a relay. When a small current 
flows in this circuit, the relay will activate its output circuit, allowing a much bigger current to flow and 
turning on the fan. 
 
 
9.1.6.2Electromechanical Relay Construction 
 In our simple relay above, we have two sets of electrically conductive contacts. Relays may be 
―Normally Open‖, or ―Normally Closed‖. One pair of contacts is classed as Normally Open, 
[NO] or make contacts and another set which are classed as Normally Closed, [NC] or break 
contacts.  
 
 In the normally open position, the contacts are closed only when the field current is ―ON‖ and the 
switch contacts are pulled towards the inductive coil. 
 
104

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
209 
 
 
 
 In the normally closed position, the 
contacts are permanently closed 
when the field current is ―OFF‖ as 
the switch contacts return to their 
normal position. These 
terms Normally Open, Normally 
Closed or Make and Break 
Contacts refer to the state of the 
electrical contacts when the relay 
coil is ―de-energized‖, i.e. no supply 
voltage connected to the relay coil. 
Contact elements may be of single 
or double make or break designs. 
 
 The relays contacts are electrically conductive pieces of metal which touch together completing a 
circuit and allow the circuit current to flow, just like a switch. When the contacts are open the 
resistance between the contacts is very high in the Mega-Ohms, producing an open circuit 
condition and no circuit current flows. 
 When the contacts are closed the contact resistance should be zero, a short circuit, but this is not 
always the case. All relay contacts have a certain amount of ―contact resistance‖ when they are 
closed and this is called the ―On-Resistance‖, similar to FET‘s. 
 
 
9.1.7 Miniature Circuit Breaker [MCB] 
 An MCB or miniature circuit breaker is an electromagnetic 
device that embodies complete enclosure in a moulded 
insulating material.  
 The main function of an MCB is to switch the circuit, i.e., 
to open the circuit [which has been connected to it] 
automatically when the current passing through it [MCB] 
exceeds the value for which it is set. It can be manually 
switched ON and OFF as similar to normal switch if 
necessary. 
 MCBs are rated at 220V for DC supply and 240/415 for 
AC supply [single and three-phase] with different short 
circuit current capacity.  
 
Typically, single phase devices have load current range of up to 100 A. Some MCBs have facility to 
adjust its tripping current capacity while some devices are fixed for some load current and short circuit 
rating. 
 
 
 
 
 
105

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
211 
 
 
 
9.1.7.1 Construction of MCB 
 An MCB embodies complete enclosure in a moulded insulating material. This provides 
mechanically strong and insulated housing. The switching system consists of a fixed and a 
moving contact to which incoming and outgoing wires are connected.  
 The metal or current carrying parts are made up of electrolytic copper or silver alloy depending 
on the rating of the circuit breaker. 
 
 
9.1.7.2 How MCB Works 
Under normal working conditions: 
 MCB operates as a switch [manual one] to make the circuit ON or OFF. Under overload or short 
circuit condition, it automatically operates or trips so that current interruption takes place in the 
load circuit.  
 The visual indication of this trip can be observed by automatic movement of the operating knob to 
OFF position. This automatic operation MCB can be obtained in two ways as we have seen in 
MCB construction; those are magnetic tripping and thermal tripping. 
 
Under overload conditions: 
 The current through the bimetal causes to raise the temperature of it. The heat generated within 
the bimetal itself enough to cause deflection due to thermal expansion of metals.  
 This deflection further releases the trip latch and hence contacts get separated. In some MCBs, 
magnetic field generated by the coil causes develop pull on bimetal such that it deflection 
activates the tripping mechanism. 
 
9.1.8 Earth-leakage circuit breaker [ELCB] 
 An Earth-leakage circuit breaker [ELCB] is a safety device used in electrical installations with high 
Earth impedance to prevent shock.  
 It detects small stray voltages on the metal enclosures of electrical equipment, and interrupts the 
circuit if a dangerous voltage is detected.  
 Once widely used, more recent installations instead use residual current circuit breakers which 
instead detect leakage current directly. 
 
9.1.8.1 Purpose 
The main purpose of Earth leakage protectors is to prevent injury to humans and animals due to 
electric shock. 
 
9.1.8.2 How ELCB works? 
 An ELCB is a specialised type of latching relay that has a building's incoming mains power 
connected through its switching contacts so that the ELCB disconnects the power in an Earth 
leakage [unsafe] condition. 
 
106

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
213 
 
 
 
 The ELCB detects fault currents from live to the Earth [ground] wire within the installation it 
protects. If sufficient voltage appears across the ELCB's sense coil, it will switch off the power, 
and remain off until manually reset.  
 A voltage-sensing ELCB does not sense fault currents from live to any other earthed body. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Trainer brings a set of fuses and asks the Trainees to identify each of them and write their 
functions.  
 The Trainer brings a Mini Circuit Breaker and asks the trainees to identify it and explain its 
working principle. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Fuse is an electronic device, which is used to protect circuits from over current, overload and 
make sure the protection of the circuit. 
 Fuses can be divided into two main categories according to the type of input supply voltage. 
 In the AC system, voltage with 60Hz or 50Hz frequency changes it amplitude from zero to 60 
times every second, so AC can be extinct easily as compared to DC. 
 Cartridge fuses are used to protect electrical appliances such as motors air-conditions, 
refrigerator, pumps etc. where high voltage rating and currents required. 
 A relay is an electromagnetic switch operated by a relatively small electric current that can turn 
on or off a much larger electric current. 
 The relays contacts are electrically conductive pieces of metal which touch together completing a 
circuit and allow the circuit current to flow, just like a switch. 
 An MCB or miniature circuit breaker is an electromagnetic device that embodies complete 
enclosure in a moulded insulating material.

Discussion: 
 The Trainer asks the Trainees to summarize the inputs they have derived from the above 
introductory activity. 
 The Trainees are expected to raise their hands before speaking. 
 Each Trainee must participate actively by adding relevant points to the discussion. 
 Finally, the Trainer winds up by rectifying the points spoken by the Trainees and adding his / her 
own insight. 
 The Trainees must jot down the crucial points in the discussion in their notebooks. 
 The Trainer proceeds with the lesson after the Discussion. 
 
 
10.1 Battery  
 A battery is a device consisting of one or more electrochemical cells with external connections 
provided to power electrical devices such as flashlights, smartphones, and electric cars. 
 When a battery is supplying electric power, its positive terminal is the cathode and its negative 
terminal is the anode. 
 The terminal marked negative is the source of electrons that when connected to an external 
circuit will flow and deliver energy to an external device.  
 When a battery is connected to an external circuit, electrolytes are able to move as ions within, 
allowing the chemical reactions to be completed at the separate terminals and so deliver energy 
to the external circuit.  
 It is the movement of those ions within the battery which allows current to flow out of the battery 
to perform work. 
 
 
10.2 Classification of Cells or Batteries 
Electrochemical batteries are classified into 4 
broad categories. 
 A primary cell or battery is one that 
cannot easily be recharged after one use, 
and are discarded following discharge.  
 Most primary cells utilize electrolytes that 
are contained within absorbent material 
or a separator [i.e. no free or liquid 
electrolyte], and are thus termed dry 
cells.  
 
 
 
113

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
227 
 
 
 
A secondary cell or battery is one that can be electrically recharged after use to their original pre-
discharge condition, by passing current through the circuit in the opposite direction to the current during 
discharge. The following graphic evidences the recharging process. 
Secondary batteries fall into two sub-categories depending on their intended applications: 
 Cells that are utilized as energy storage devices, delivering energy on demand. Such cells are 
typically connected to primary power sources so as to be fully charged on demand.  
Examples of these types of secondary cells include emergency no-fail and standby power 
sources, aircraft systems and stationary energy storage systems for load-levelling. 
 
 Cells that are essentially utilized as primary cells, but are recharged after use rather than being 
discarded.  
Examples of these types of secondary cells primarily include portable consumer electronics and 
electric vehicles. 
 
 
 
 
 
10.3 Primary vs. Secondary – A Comparison 
The following table summarizes the pros and cons of primary and secondary batteries.

Primary 
Secondary 
Lower initial cost. 
Higher life-cycle cost [$/kWh]. 
 
Disposable. 
Disposable. 
Replacement readily available. 
  
  
Typically lighter and smaller; thus 
traditionally more suited for portable 
applications. 
  
 
Longer service per charge and good charge 
retention. 
  
 
Not ideally suited for heavy load/high 
discharge rate performance. 
  
Not ideally suited for load-levelling, 
emergency backup, hybrid battery, and high 
cost military applications. 
  
 Traditionally limited to specific applications. 
Higher initial cost. 
Lower life-cycle cost [$/kWh] if charging in 
convenient and inexpensive. 
Regular maintenance required. 
Periodic recharging required. 
Replacements while available are not produced 
in the same sheer numbers as primary 
batteries. May need to be pre-ordered. 
Traditionally less suited for portable 
applications, although recent advances in 
Lithium battery technology have led to the 
development of smaller/lighter secondary 
batteries. 
  
Relative to primary battery systems, traditional 
secondary batteries [particularly aqueous 
secondary batteries] exhibit inferior charge 
retention. 
  
Superior high discharge rate performance at 
heavy loads 
  
Ideally suited for load-levelling, emergency 
backup, hybrid battery and high cost military 
applications 
 
The overall inherent versatility of secondary 
battery systems allows its use and continuing 
research for a large spectrum of applications. 
 
 
10.4 Battery Maintenance  
Regular testing and inspection will help to maximize battery life. A routine inspection at least once a 
month is recommended to maintain optimum performance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
115

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
231 
 
 
 
 
Keep the following points in mind in regard to maintenance of a battery: 
1. Ensure the battery top is clean and dry, free of dirt and grime. A 
dirty battery can discharge across the grime on top of the battery 
casing. 
2. Inspect the terminals, screws, clamps and cables for breakage, 
damage or loose connections. These should be clean, tight and 
free of corrosion.  
3. Apply a thin coating of high temperature grease to posts and 
cable connections for added protection. 
4. Inspect the battery case for obvious signs of physical damage. 
This usually indicates the battery has overheated or has been 
overcharged. 
5. If the battery is maintainable, check electrolyte levels to ensure 
that fluid levels are over the top of battery plates. If necessary, 
top up using distilled or demineralized water. Never top up fluid 
levels with acid. 
6. Test the battery using either a hydrometer or voltmeter and 
charge if necessary. 
  
 
 
 
 
Exercise 
 
1. What is a battery? 
2. What do you understand by primary cell and secondary cell? 
3. What is Cathode and Anode? 
4. When was the first rechargeable battery invented? 
5. Which equipment is used to test the charge of a battery? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DO YOU KNOW? 
The first 
rechargeable 
battery was 
invented in 1859, 
when French 
physicist Gaston 
Plante invented the 
lead acid cell, which 
is still used in cars 
today.

10.5 Battery Charging  
 Charging your battery also plays a key role in keeping it safe and 
maintained.  You need to charge your battery in the right manner 
so that it gains a long life and run without any complications. 
 
Safety Precautions 
To keep your battery safe and maintained, here are some safety 
precautions that you must always keep in mind prior to charging it: 
1. Turn the charger off before attaching, rocking or removing the 
terminal clamps. 
2. Keep open flames and sparks away from the battery. 
3. Keep vent caps in place. 
4. Charge in well-ventilated area. 
5. Follow the battery charger manufacturer‘s instructions to avoid overheating. 
 
10.6 Preparation of Electrolyte 
An electrolyte is a substance that produces an electrically conducting solution when dissolved 
in any solvent. 
Batteries consist of two half-cell reactions connected by a salt bridge and supported in an electrolyte 
solution. The two half-cells that operate in these batteries are the lead and the hydrogen half-cells. As 
the lead enters the solution, the electrons flow from that electrode to the other electrode where the lead 
dioxide molecules accept the electrons and converts to oxygen gas. The electrolyte solution is able to 
support the electrical flow between electrodes. In the lead acid battery, sulfuric acid and water are the 
electrolyte.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
118

 
 
Electrician Domestic 
 
   
 
 
 
237 
 
 
 
The steps to prepare an electrolyte are:  
 
I. 
Using electronic balance, measure exactly 
the amount of electrolyte you intent to use. 
 
II. 
Using a funnel, pour the entire electrolyte 
into the volumetric flask. 
 
III. 
Wash the glass and the funnel with distilled 
water. 
 
IV. 
Mix around 25ml of distilled water into the 
flask, and then shake the flask to dissolve 
the electrolyte. 
 
V. 
After dissolving the electrolyte add the rest 
of the amount of water needed until it 
touches the 250ml line. 
 
VI. 
Now you have accurately created a 250ml 
0.1 or 0.3M solution.

In medicine, electrolyte replacement is needed when a patient has prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. It is 
also useful as a response to persistent athletic activity. Commercial electrolyte solutions are available, 
particularly for sick children [oral rehydration solutions] and athletes [sports drinks].  
 
 
 
 
 The Trainer will ask the Trainees to prepare a chart paper project where they will have to 
differentiate between primary and secondary cells.  
 The Trainer will conduct a quiz session where he/she will divide the trainees into 2 groups. Both 
the groups will be asked how they will ensure complete maintenance of their batteries. The group 
that gives the best answer will be declared winners. 
 The trainer will ask the students to watch a video on the process of making electrolyte. 
 The link is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHFWOkio9dQ 
 
 
 
 
 
 A battery is a device consisting of one or more electrochemical cells with external connections 
provided to power electrical devices. 
 A secondary cell or battery is one that can be electrically recharged after use to their original pre-
discharge condition, by passing current through the circuit in the opposite direction to the current

IRON: 
 
1. The first step is to switch off the 
connection besides the plug point. 
2. Next, unplug the iron. You should 
perform this step after you are sure 
that the appliance has cooled down. 
3. Check the electric cord, sole plate 
and thermostat in case it does not 
heat up to the highest level or the 
clothes clings to the appliance. 
 
4. One of the reasons for this fault may 
be due to the accumulation (built-up) 
of debris (mineral deposits) in steam 
vents. 
5. Take the help of pipe cleaner or 
toothpick for removing the build-up. It 
is important to consider that the 
debris should not clog or block the 
steam vents. 
6. With the assistance of a fine needle 
(sewing), clean spray nozzle 
carefully. 
 
7. For issue in sole plate, open the 
cover plate with an appropriate 
screwdriver. 
8. Check the calibration of the 
thermostat and then clean the sole 
plate.

FAN: 
 
1. The first step is to turn off the fan‘s circuit 
breaker. 
2. Unscrew the outside nuts of the fan and 
remove the connection that holds the fan 
with the main switch.  
 
3. Pull out the switch and leave the wires 
attached. 
4. Note down in a separate sheet the wire 
colours attached to each terminal 
 
5. If the problem is related to the switch, first 
detach the wires. After that, take the switch 
as per the fan model. 
6. In case of new switch installation, you will 
find the attachment of wires directly with 
the terminals. So, you need to bend the 
individual wire around the respective 
terminal. You should tighten the screws in 
a clockwise direction. 
 
7. Suppose the switch wire is connected with 
wire-nuts, with a wire insulation strip of 1/2‖ 
to 3/4‖ width, wrap the two in a clockwise 
direction. 
8. After covering the bare wire, it is 
mandatory to twist the connector in 
clockwise. 
 
9. Now you can see a hole in fan housing. 
So, from inside, insert the switch. And from 
outside, thread the nut. 
10. Attach the cover and turn on the breaker.

11.4 How to repair House Wiring Cables 
The following diagram shows the steps of house wiring repair: 
 
1. Switch off the power source connecting 
the damaged cable. 
 
2. Added to it, for extra safety, switch off the 
main power lines. Location of the source 
can be in the breaker box. 
3. Try to locate the damaged section. Look if 
the problem is with multiple wires (single 
sheath) or a single one. 
4. Look if the wire‘s copper core is intact or 
not. Also, see if the wire‘s metal is fused 
with another. 
5. Remove the damaged section and throw it 
away. To expose the non-damaged end of 
the cable, cut and remove 2‖ off the 
sheathing.  
 
6. Choose the required replacement cable 
length and remove 2‖ off the sheathing. 
This will help in ensuring similar length of 
replacement cable‘s gauge with that of the 
damaged cable. Also, it will help in 
identifying the wires as per their colour. 
7. From each wire‘s end, expose a minimum 
of 1‖ copper wire core. This splicing will be 
for all the 4 ends – 2 from removed 
section and 2 from replacement‘s one. 
8. With wire cutters, get rid of wire shielding 
without damaging the wires.

Look for same colours when joining the 
wires. 
 
10. In the joint area, cover the copper wires 
with electrical tape. A minimum of 3 layers 
is advisable. 
11. For better result, cover all of those with 
another layer of electrical tape.  
 
12. Switch on both the power points and test 
its functionality.
