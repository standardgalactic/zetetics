Molecular dynamics (MD) techniques are widely used in
computing free-energy changes for conformational transi-
tions and chemical reactions, in particular, to study such
processes in condensed matter systems. Most of the MD-
based approaches employ biased sampling of a priori se-
lected coarse grained coordinates or collective variables
(CV) and thereby accelerating otherwise infrequent tran-
sitions between different free-energy basins. A quick con-
vergence in free-energy estimations can be achieved by en-
hanced sampling of large number of CVs. Conventional en-
hanced sampling approaches become exponentially slower
with increasing dimensionality of the CV-space, and thus
theyturnouttobehighlyinefﬁcientinsamplinghigh-dimensional
free-energy landscapes. Here we focus on some of the novel
methods that are designed to overcome this limitation. In
particular, we discuss four methods: bias exchange metady-
namics, parallel bias metadynamics, adiabatic free-energy
dynamics/temperature accelerated MD, and temperature
accelerated sliced sampling. The basic idea behind these
techniques are presented and the applications using these
techniques are illustrated. Advantages and disadvantages
of these techniques are delineated.

INTRODUCTION
Free-energy changes along the reaction coordinate of a chemical reaction manifests the feasibility of the process at
a given temperature. Reaction coordinate, χ, on the other hand, can be an intricate function of nuclear coordinates
even for a simple elementary reaction. To simplify, χ can be written as a linear combination of several coarse grained
coordinates or collective variables (CV), S, as,
χ(R) =
Õ
i
ci Si (R) ,
where R is the set of all atomic coordinates, and {ci } is the set of coefﬁcients. Computing the free-energy landscape
F (S) and ﬁnding the lowest free-energy path χ(S) on this landscape could provide valuable information regarding the
mechanism and kinetics of the reaction.[1, 2] Free-energy calculations using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
are widely used for this purpose, and is the most preferred approach while dealing with soft matter systems. MD
based sampling enables one to account for entropic contributions, going beyond the standard quantum-harmonic
approximations.
In order to compute F (S), it is important that all the relevant conformational states for a given S is sampled in MD
simulations.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] On the other hand, probability (P (R)) to visit a conformational state R at temperatureT , is
proportional to e−βU(R), whereU(R) is the potential energy, β = 1/(kBT ) and kB is the Boltzmann constant. As a result,
high potential regions are less visited or never visited compared to low–potential energy parts of the potential energy
landscape in a ﬁnite length MD trajectory. Thus barrier crossing on a potential energy landscape turns out to be an
infrequent or “rare” event in MD simulations. Even moderately (i.e. only a few kBT ) high potential energy regions can be
insufﬁciently sampled, resulting in poor statistics.
This problem can be alleviated by modifying the potential energy surface by adding a bias potential.[2] If the
potential energy of the low–potential regions is raised, the barrier crossing events are accelerated. In such biased-
sampling simulations, the probability of visiting R gets modiﬁed as,
˜P (R) ∝e−β
h
U(R)+V b(S)
i
.
HereV b(S) is the bias potential added along a selected set of CVs or all the nuclear coordinates. Alternative way to
speed-up the exploration of potential energy landscape is by increasing temperatureT (i.e., by decreasing β).
For the case of time-independent bias potentialV b(s), the biased probability distribution of CVs, ˜P (s), is related to
P (s) as,[7]
P (s) = ˜P (s) eβV b(s) ,

where
˜P (s) ≡

and ⟨· · · ⟩V b denotes the ensemble average from the biased MD simulation. Now, from P (s), free-energy surface can be
computed as,
F (s) = −β −1 ln P (s) .
(1)
Free-energy surface can be also computed based on integrating the mean-force as
∆F (s) =
∫s

 dF


.
Biased sampling techniques use different ways to obtainV b(s) that compensates the underlying free-energy landscape.
For e.g. metadynamics[8, 9] constructs the bias potential as a function of time by a time-dependent update of the
bias, while umbrella sampling[7] (US) uses time-independent biases to compute P (s) directly. The bias potential is
self-consistently obtained in recently developed variational enhanced sampling method.[10] Blue-moon ensemble[11]
and Adaptive Bias Force methods (see Ref.[12] and references therein) are two examples which use the biased/unbiased
mean-forces to compute free-energy.[2] In adiabatic free-energy dynamics (AFED) [13] P (s) is calculated directly from
the high-temperature dynamics of CVs.
Alternatively, equilibrium probability distribution and free-energies can be computed using replica–exchange based
global-tempering approaches.[2, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] In the widely used parallel-tempering approach,[19] exploration of
the potential energy landscape is enhanced in a high–temperature replica, while a low–temperature replica exchanges its
coordinates with a higher–temperature replica with certain probability. The advantage of global tempering simulations
is that a priori assumption of CVs is not necessary. Readers are directed to authoritative books[2, 1, 20] and reviews on
various sampling methods for further details.[21, 6, 5, 22, 3, 23]
Other than the requirement of a priori selection of CVs, the major limitation of the CV-based approaches is its expo-
nentially decreasing computational efﬁciency with increase in the dimensionality of the CV space. When modeling an
elementary reaction, free-energy surface for the process can be often expressed with one or two collective coordinates
in a way that free-energy of all the reactant states, transition state and product states can be obtained.[2] However,
enhanced sampling of one or two CVs may not be sufﬁcient to compute free-energies accurately, especially for processes
in soft-matter systems. This arises from the fact that transverse degrees of freedoms are unbiased and their sampling is
slow due to ﬁnite barriers prevailing in the orthogonal directions. Therefore, including more orthogonal CVs is beneﬁcial
for obtaining reliable free-energy estimates from short MD simulations. Requirement of methods that could enhance
the sampling of perpendicular coordinates without loosing the efﬁciency of the simulation is now comprehensible. This
review focuses on four such methods, which are designed to sample large number of CVs efﬁciently and have been
already demonstrated for modeling rare-events in soft matter systems with more than 3 CVs.

BIAS EXCHANGE METADYNAMICS
Metadynamics approach uses a time dependent bias potential to enhance the sampling of the conﬁgurational space.[24,
9] Readers can refer to a number of reviews on the topic.[25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 22, 30, 21] The bias potential has the form
V b(S, t) =
Õ
τ<t
w(τ) exp
"
−(S −Sτ)2
2 (δs)2
#
which is the sum of Gaussian functions deposited along the trajectory of S at discrete time τ. Here, w is the height of the
Gaussian (in the units of energy) and δs is the width parameter. The Lagrangian for performing metadynamics is
LMTD(R, ÛR) = L0(R, ÛR) −V b(S, t) ,
where L0 is the unbiased Lagrangian of the system. The bias potentialV b that compensates the underlying potential
is gradually built along the trajectory of CVs. As the bias ﬂattens the free-energy basin, the system exits from one
free-energy basin to the other. Most importantly, in metadynamics, the free-energy surface can be computed from the
bias potential itself, as
F (S) = −V b(S, t →∞) + constant .
In a simple metadynamics procedure the Gaussian parameters wτ and δs are ﬁxed. However, there are procedures
to change these parameters adaptively for obtaining proper convergence in free-energy estimates. [31, 32] Most
importantly, the well–tempered version of metadynamics scales w(τ) based on the underlying bias potentialV b at time
τ:[31]
w(τ) = w(0) exp

−V b(S, τ)
kB∆T

,
where w(0) is initial Gaussian height and ∆T is the tempering parameter. In well-tempered metadynamics, free-energy
can be computed as[31, 33]
F (S) = −γV b(S, t →∞) + constant,
where γ = (T + ∆T ) /∆T .
In principle, the method requires no modiﬁcation to sample large number of CVs. However, the number of Gaussian
functions require to build the bias that compensates the underlying free-energy surface increases exponentially with
the system size. In practice, metadynamics is used to sample low dimensional landscapes, most often using 2 CVs, rarely
with 3 CVs, and in some special cases even higher;[27] see also Ref. [34].
In order to improve the efﬁciency of metadynamics in sampling high-dimensional free-energy surfaces, bias-
exchange metadynamics (BEMetaD) approach was proposed by Piana and Laio.[35] In this approach, M number of
replicas of the system at same temperature are initiated, and in each of these replicas, different small number of CVs are
enhance-sampled using metadynamics bias built independently in each replica. Exchanges between randomly chosen
two replicas are then attempted at regular time intervals, as in the case of other replica exchange MD schemes; see
Figure 1. Each replica samples one or two dimensional CV space, therefore sampling a high-dimensional space becomes

CVs.

A later work by Galvelis and Sugita[36] has shown that exchange rates between two replicas and the convergence of
free-energies can be expedited by using inﬁnite swapping or the Suwa-Todo (ST) algorithms, replacing the Metropolis-
Hastings scheme.
Reconstructing the high-dimensional free-energy surface requires appropriate reweighting; see Refs. [35, 37] for
details. The unbiased probability contribution due to the bias from a replica h can be written as

where the reweighting is done for a time interval tini and tmax during which the average bias potential only increases
uniformly across the domain of S of our interest. In the above, fh is some constant, and has to be determined. Now,
using the weighted histogram analysis method[38] (WHAM) one can combine {Ph(s)} to get the total reweighted
probability density P (s), and hence the free-energy F (s). A detailed review of the method and other technical details
can be found in Ref. [37]. Laio and co-workers have also designed a visual interface program for reweighting and analysis
of PBMetaD simulations.[39] Another simpler approach for reweighting was suggested by Yu and Lin [40], where a
standard time-independent reweighting is done using the converged free-energies Fh(Sh).
Alternatively, time dependent bias can be directly used for reweighting following the works of Tiwary and Par-
rinello. [6] Here,

considering that a well-tempered bias potential is used. Employing WHAM, one can then combine the reweighted
free-energy surfaces from each replica h, similar to the procedure used by Awasthi et al. [41]. It is noted that the WHAM
approach for combining the distributions of different replicas can only work if the distributions have enough overlap.
A number of applications using BEMetaD in studying biological systems can be found in the literature. Piana
and Laio [35] employed 5 CVs to study the folding of Trp-Cage in explicit water. They used number of Cγ contacts
(CV1), number of Cα contacts (CV2), number of backbone H-bonds (CV3), number of backbone ψ dihedrals within the
α-domain of the Ramachandran map (CV4), and correlation between the successive ψ-dihedral angles (CV5). These
simulations were performed with 8 replicas, where 5 replicas were using one-dimensional biases to sample one of the
ﬁve CVs. Two replicas were using a two-dimensional bias to sample (CV3,CV4) and (CV4,CV5) CV-space. The last replica
was a neutral one, i.e. without any bias, and it was permitted to exchange with other walkers. The neutral replica was
used to monitor the convergence, which in principle should result in a canonical distribution. In their work, within 20 ns,
convergence in free-energy was observed. Free-energy proﬁle along different CVs are given in Figure 2. The trajectories
from these simulations have been used to perform cluster analysis and the folding kinetics has been obtained.[42]
A number of different problems have been studied by BEMetaD. For sampling various conformations of chro-
mophores attached to a protein, Delor et al.[43] used BEMetaD. Structural changes in RNA nucleotides and lig-
and binding were studied using this approach by Mlýnský and Bussi.[44] BEMetaD was used for investigating more
complex problems like DNA G-Quadraplex [45] folding, and formation of RNA pseudoknot[46]. Ligand and drug
association and dissociation studies in proteins [47, 48, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54], peptides [55] and lipids[56] and
conformations of protein:ligand complex[57] have been also carried out using this method. BEMetaD simulation
of ion binding in RNA [58] has been recently reported. A number of studies used BEMetaD to study protein fold-
ing. [59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67] Literature of BEMetaD also includes conformational sampling in α-helical

well as other proteins [72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90], conduction through ion
channels [91, 92, 93, 94, 95], and protein aggregation. [96, 97, 98] The method has also helped to resolve the structure
of large and complex systems like protein-RNA complex [99], and membrane inserted inﬂuenza fusion peptide [100].
Clearly, a substantial number of complex biophysical problems have been addressed by the approach.
One of the major limitations of this approach is the requirement of the replica-exchange. Care should be given
to achieve a proper overlap of probability distributions between the replicas. These limit BEMetaD computations
to be used for studying chemical reactions in ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) where computationally expensive
ﬁrst-principle based QM forces are used to propagate the atomic motion. Study of chemical reactions using BEMetaD
and AIMD has not been reported so far.

Sketch showing the working of PBMetaD. Here, low-dimensional free-energy surfaces are sampled
parallely within the same replica. Gaussian height of the bias added along one CV is scaled according to the bias added
along other CVs. Reweighting methods can recover the high-dimensional free-energy landscapes.
Another variant of metadynamics method called the Parallel Bias metadynamics (PBMetaD)[101] alleviates some
of the limitations of BEMetaD. In this method low-dimensional (usually one-dimensional) biases are added along CVs
concurrently. Only one replica of the system is considered. To ensure that the one-dimensional bias potentials added on
different one-dimensional CVs converge to the correct free-energy, bias potential along each CV is dynamically scaled.

High-dimensional free energy surfaces can be also reconstructed by reweighting the trajectory from a ﬁxed-bias
simulation or employing the the Tiwary-Parrinello[6] reweighting (with appropriate modiﬁcations) using the dynamic
biasV b
PB(s, t).
The major advantage compared to BEMetaD is that only one-replica is used for biasing more than one CVs. Espe-
cially, replica exchange is avoided in the approach.
Pfaendtner and Bonomi have used this approach in studying the conformational changes in the Tryp-cage protein
with implicit solvent.[101] Authors have used six CVs with each CV being biased with one-dimensional bias potentials.
The CVs chosen were number of Cγ contacts, number of backbone H-bonds, α-helicity, β-similarity, correlation between
the successive backbone dihedral angles, and radius-of-gyration. They compared the performance of the method
with BEMetaD and it was found that the free-energy convergence behavior of PBMetaD is as good as BEMetaD.
BEMetaD together with the Metadynamic Metainterface method was used to explore the structural ensembles of
ligand-association in a disordered protein.[102, 103] Conformational sampling of peptoids at the hyrophobic and
hydrophilic surface-water interface was modeled by Prakash et al.[104]
Recently, PBMetaD was used to obtain the reaction network of decomposition of γ-ketohydroperoxid.[105] In this
work, Fu and Pfaendtner used the SPRINT (social permutation invariant) collective coordinates[106] as CVs for sampling
different reaction pathways. SPRINT coordinates allows one to explore the potential energy landscape and the reaction
pathways with least chemical knowledge and input. On the other hand, one SPRINT CV per atom is required and thus
for a reasonably large system, the number of coordinates become very large and efﬁcient sampling by conventional
approaches become difﬁcult. Since PBMetaD enables parallel sampling of one-dimensional CVs with one-dimensional
MetaD biases, the method is well suited to sample large number of SPRINT CVs. Authors have used the PM6 method
within the AMBER program to sample 12-CVs. The obtained reaction pathways were then reﬁned using static QM
calculations; see Figure 4.

introducing high temperature ˜T , such that ˜T ≫T0 for n CV degrees of freedom while the remaining degrees of freedom
are maintained at the desired physical temperatureT0. In particular, the temperature ˜T is chosen such that CVs can
cross the high energy barriers on the potential energy landscape. It is, however crucial that energy ﬂow from the “hot”
CV degrees of freedom to the rest of the “cold” nuclear degrees of freedom is avoided. Adiabatic separation between
the two subsystems is achieved by choosing a larger mass for the CV degrees of freedom compared to the rest of the
nuclear degrees of freedom. Further thermostats are coupled to maintain the temperature of the two subsystems.
Under the condition of adiabatic decoupling it was shown that free-energy along the CVs, F (S), atT0 can be constructed
directly from the probability distribution ˜P (S) as, [13, 2]
F (S1, · · · , Sn) = −1

sampling of the CV subspace from the full coordinate-space requires coordinate transformation from Cartesian to CV.
Implementation of such transformation is not straightforward for many non-linear CVs and the method requires major
changes in an existing MD code.
Maragliano et al. [108] alleviated the problem of coordinate transformation in AFED by introducing an extended
Lagrangian scheme, like in Ref.[9], and reformulated AFED in the extended CV-space. This method is called Temperature
Accelerated MD or driven-AFED (TAMD/d-AFED) [108, 109]. Here a set of auxiliary variables {sα } are introduced that
are coupled with the CVs {Sα } through a harmonic potential having force constant kα. The Lagrangian for TAMD/d-

used this approach to predict peptide conformations. TAMD/d-AFED and the Monte-Carlo version of TAMD were
employed to study vacancy diffusion in crystals, [118] wherein very complex CVs were used such as moments computed
by the quantum-mechanical (QM) probability density of a pseudo probe particle. In an another interesting application
of TAMD, 720 three-dimensional vectorial CVs were used to sample the conformational changes in hydrated Naﬁon
polymeric system. [119] Yu and Tuckerman have extended the TAMD/d–AFED approach to study crystal structure
changes.[111] This was achieved by using supercell vectors or h-matrix elements as the CVs in a ﬂexible-cell N PT
ensemble MD simulation. This approach was shown to be very efﬁcient in sampling crystal structures, including organic
crystals.[120, 121, 122, 123] In Figure 6, TAMD/d-AFED trajectories exploring crystal structures of benzene at 100 K
and 2 GPa are shown.[111] In that work,[111] h matrix elements were used as the CVs and ˜T of 31000 K was taken
for enhancing the conformational changes between different polymorphs of benzene. It is worth noting that TAMD/d-
AFED combined with DFT based AIMD was used by Samanta et al. [122] to study the melting of high-pressure phase
of SiO2. To improve the efﬁciency of sampling by TAMD/d–AFED, Tuckerman and co–workers [124] integrated it
with biased sampling of CVs, which they named as the Uniﬁed Free-Energy Dynamics (UFED) method. In UFED, high
temperature and bias potential were simultaneously applied on all the CVs. TAMD/d-AFED and UFED methods have
been used to compute accurate mean-forces and then used to optimize structures and reaction pathways on free-energy
surfaces.[125, 126] These techniques were also used to compute free-energy differences between two conformations or
structures by combining with alchemical free-energy perturbation methods [127, 128] and by calculating free-energies
along an arbitrary pathway which connects two conformations.[129]

TEMPERATURE ACCELERATED SLICED SAMPLING
In many chemical reactions, broad and unbound free-energy surfaces can be seen along the crucial “reactive” CVs; see
Figure 7. Ideal examples include free-energy proﬁle for A+B type reaction (along A-B distance), drug binding (along
drug-active site distance), and protein-folding (along end-to-end distance). As a result, the system will be driven towards
uninteresting regions of the free-energy landscape during the enhanced sampling simulations. Thus, the reaction of
interest may not be observed or might require long MD simulations. This issue becomes more serious while modeling
chemical reactions using AIMD, since the free-energy estimations with AIMD have to be carried out within few tens of
picoseconds.
Methods based on metadynamics and TAMD/d-AFED suffer from this problem. A controlled sampling of CVs is
crucial to overcome this limitation. This could be achieved by US [7] where the CVs are restrained at different CV
positions, and probability along the CV is obtained by combining the biased-probabilities from different umbrella-
windows using WHAM [130, 38] or other methods.[131, 2] However, standard US is often performed using one CV. In
that case, transverse coordinates may relax slowly leading to slow converge of free-energy estimates, as discussed
earlier.
To overcome this problem, Awasthi et al. combined US with metadynamics (which we termed as “well-sliced
metadynamics”), where the CV along which a ﬂat unbound free-energy surface is expected is sampled by US in a
controlled manner, while the orthogonal coordinates are sampled by well-tempered metadynamics. [41] Well-sliced
metadynamics approach was then extended to accommodate large-number of CVs, by combining it with TAMD/d-
AFED approach.[132] This method is called Temperature Accelerated Sliced Sampling (TASS). In TASS, the following

where h = 1, · · · , M number of umbrella-windows are considered. The extended Lagrangian approach used here is
similar to the TAMD/d-AFED method discussed in the previous section. All the auxiliary variables are coupled to a
high temperature bath and nuclear degrees of freedom are thermostatted to a physically relevant colder temperature.
Mass µα of an auxiliary variable is taken much higher than the nuclear mass to ensure adiabatic separation between
the auxiliary and the nuclear subsystems. The main difference to the TAMD/d-AFED method is that, umbrella-bias

is applied along one of the CVs, while one or more other CVs are chosen to sample by the
metadynamics biasV b. Thus for each umbrella window h, transverse CVs are enhance-sampled by both metadynamics
bias as well as high-temperature. The CVs that are not biased byWh andV b
h are enhanced only by high temperature (as
in TAMD/d-AFED). A cartoon showing the basic working principle behind the TASS method is given in Figure 8.
In this way, TASS samples a high-dimensional slice of the free-energy surface along the US coordinate. Biased
probability distribution obtained from each slice h, ˜Ph(s), is then reweighted, as in Eqn (2), and then combined using the
WHAM method; see Ref.[132, 41] for more details. As in the TAMD/d-AFED method, free-energy can be obtained using
Eqn (5).
Thus, this method can be viewed as an improvement over metadynamics and TAMD/d-AFED as it can sample ﬂat,
broad, and unbound surfaces in an efﬁcient manner, and it has the advantage that large number of transverse CVs
can be sampled like in TAMD/d-AFED. TASS can also be considered as an improvisation of the US method by enabling
sampling of large number of orthogonal CVs in a simultaneous manner, thus achieving quick convergence in free-energy

A schematic representation on the working principle of the TASS method is shown for a case with three

estimates. Furthermore, TASS has the ﬂexibility to choose different orthogonal CVs for different umbrella windows.
This feature is particularly useful when studying complex chemical reactions where the crucial transverse coordinates
change with the progress of the reaction along the “reactive” CV (which is the US CV in most of the cases).
Awasthi and Nair have showed the applicability of the method for computing free energy surfaces of chemical
reactions in AIMD and hybrid QM/MM MD simulations.[132] Free-energy surface of alanine tripeptide was also mapped
using 4 CVs, and free-energies were showing good convergence within 10 ns per umbrella window (and 31 umbrella
windows were used).[132] Awasthi et al. [133] used TASS to study deacylation and reverse acylation reactions of
Aztreonam drug catalyzed by class-C β lactamase enzyme. These simulations were using DFT based QM/MM MD
methods. For studying the reverse acylation reaction, i.e. EI →ES in Figure 9, authors used eight CVs. In this reaction C2
makes a bond with N1 and recyclize the β-lactam ring; see Figure 9 for labeling. Several conformational changes of the
side-chains of the active site ligands are anticipated during this reaction. As these conformational changes are likely to
be infrequent events (at least within the small timescale accessible for the QM/MM simulations), enhance sampling of
these events were also carried out by appropriate choice of CVs. Two different proton transfer routes were also probed
with the CVs considered. The distance d[AztN1 −AztC2] (CV1) was chosen for the US bias, as this CV samples the
recylization of the β-lactam ring. At the same time, a broad free energy basin is expected along this CV since different

conformations of the ring-opened drug is possible in the EI state. Another CV (CV2), namely the coordination of AztN1
to its hydrogen and to the hydrogen atoms of the active site water W1 (C[AztN1 −{AztN1H1, W1H}]), was chosen
for biasing with one-dimensional metadynamics bias. This choice was made as relatively high free-energy barrier is
expected for covalent-bond breaking and the free-energy surface along CV2 should have a bound and narrow topology.
Temperature of the auxiliary variables was set to 1000 K while the system temperature was kept at 300 K. In total 16
umbrella windows were placed at equal distance from 1.3 to 2.9 Å along CV1. It was observed that the free-energy
barrier converges within 9 ps (per umbrella window).[133] The converged free energy surface was computed using the
reweighting procedure explained in Ref. [132] and then projected to CV1 and CV2 as shown in Figure 9.

TASS was also used in the study of Mg2+ assisted pyrophosphate release in a sugar nucleotidyltransferase. [134] In
that work, 10 CVs were chosen, which included several torsional angles of the side-chain residues which interacted
with the pyrophosphate. It was shown that US predicts a slightly different mechanism and a higher free energy barrier

compared to TASS as a result of poor sampling of orthogonal coordinates by the former method. Sahoo and Nair used
TASS to simulate proton exchange reaction between methane and acid-sites within the H-ZSM-5 zeolite using DFT
based QM/polarized-MM simulations. [135] Without invoking a controlled sampling of distance between CH4 and
the acid site in zeolite, CH4 molecule diffuses away from the acid-sites during the simulation. By the virtue of the
umbrella-bias in the TASS formulation, controlled sampling of this coordinate could be carried out, thus making the
free-energy computations highly efﬁcient.

CONCLUSIONS
Accelerating large number of CVs and thus exploring a high-dimensional free-energy landscape is crucial to to obtain a
quick free-energy convergence in MD simulations. Conventional methods like US and metadynamics are inefﬁcient in
exploring high-dimensional landscapes, as sampling efﬁciency decreases exponentially with the number of CVs. We
have discussed four promising methods in detail which mitigate the limitations imposed by the dimensionality of the
CV-space.
BEMetaD is quite popular today and is mostly applied to study wide variety of problems in bimolecular systems.
However, the main limitation of this method is the need of replica-exchange which requires overlapping probability
distributions between two replicas. This decreases the computational efﬁciency of the method. As a result, BEMetaD
based AIMD simulation of chemical reaction in soft matter systems has not been reported yet. PBMetaD alleviates
this problem by parallel sampling of CVs within single replica. PBMetaD has the scope of sampling large number of
CVs, and has been also used in studying conformational changes in bimolecular systems and chemical reactions using
AIMD (with semi-empirical Hamiltonian). Efﬁciency of PBMetaD would also diminish with the increase of number
of CVs due to the mutually dependent scaling of biases. On the other hand, TAMD/d-AFED approach is shown to
be very powerful in enhanced sampling with a few hundreds of CVs. However, TAMD/d-AFED method should be
carefully carried out as maintaining adiabatic separation between CV subsystem and physical subsystem is vital. Further,
increasing CV temperature can result in unphysical structural changes, especially when the force-ﬁelds are not designed
to operate at high temperatures. TAMD/d-AFED method has been used in AIMD simulations, conformational sampling
in biomolecular systems and crystal structure predictions. On the other hand, all the three methods discussed above can
become inefﬁcient in exploring free-energy basins that are broad and unbound. A controlled sampling of CVs is preferred
to avoid sampling myriad of uninteresting conﬁgurations. This is achieved in the relatively new TASS sampling method
which combines US, metadynamics and TAMD/d-AFED. The method has been shown to be powerful for computing
high-dimensional free-energy surfaces of chemical reactions, including enzymatic reactions. Even the computationally
expensive DFT based QM/MM methods have been used with TASS and a quick free-energy convergence was reported.
One of the shortcoming of TASS is that prior chemical knowledge is required to select the type of biasing along the CVs
in an efﬁcient manner.
A variety of problems like protein-folding, ligand binding in proteins and nucleic acids, structural reﬁnements of
biomolecules based on experimental data, crystal structure predictions, exploration of reaction pathways, and modeling
of enzymatic reactions require quick sampling of large number of transverse CVs, which can now be studied using
the aforementioned methods. Combining these CV-based approaches with global-tempering methods could further
strengthen these computational methods to study more complex problems.
