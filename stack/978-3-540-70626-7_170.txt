Quantum Jumps

Niels Bohr’s (1885–1962)  atomic model initially provoked much opposition.
“Bohr’s work on the quantum theory of the Balmer formula (in the Phil. Mag.) has
driven me to despair”, the Leyden theoretician Paul Ehrenfest (1880–1933) wrote

his colleague Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1853–1928) on 25 August 1913. “If this is
the way to reach the goal, I must give up doing physics.” The assumption of ‘quan-
tum jumps’, i.e., an  electron’s sudden and unpredictable transition between two
stable orbits around the nucleus, was an integral part of Bohr’s model. Bohr’s men-
tor Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937)in Manchester raised doubts about it in a letter to
Bohr, dated 20 March 1913: “How does an electron decide what frequency it is go-
ing to vibrate at when it passes from one stationary state to the other? It seems to me
that you would have to assume that the electron knows beforehand where it is go-
ing to stop.” Knowing that was indeed imperative in Bohr’s semi-classical model of
emission and absorption, because the electromagnetic wave of frequency v (linked
to the energy difference E between two stationary states by E = hv) must ‘start
radiating’ as soon as the electron ‘jumps’ (cf. also Fig. 1). According to Ruther-
ford, Bohr’s effort to combine a discontinuous quantum process of emission and
absorption with a classical continuum model of radiation as electromagnetic waves
thus raised deep problems concerning causality  indeterminism. These problems
stayed with semi-classical  quantum theory to its bitter end and were even aggra-
vated in the quantum mechanics of 1925/26.
Bohr’s solution was simply to declare classical electrodynamics out of order. The
problem that any charged particles (such as  electrons on their ‘orbits’ around the
positively charged nucleus) must continually loose energy (Larmor’s theorem) was
thus done away with.1 He was so bold as to stipulate that the atom only radiates
during ‘jumps’ between energy levels and refused to go into further detail about the
physical processes involved. Instead he sought a suitable phenomenologicaldescrip-
tion, concentrating on  observables before and after a given measurement. Because
particularly for the  Stark effect and  Zeeman effect the number of combinator-
ically possible transitions between energy levels exceeds the number of observed
spectral lines,  selection rules had to be imposed to reduce the number of admis-
sible ‘jumps’. As long as the interaction between different electrons of one atom is

1 After hearing a talk on Bohr’s atomic model in the Zurich physics colloquium, Max von Laue
(1879–1960) rose and said: “That’s all nonsense; Maxwell’s equations are correct under all circum-
stances, and an electron orbiting around a positive nucleus is bound to radiate.” (Quoted in [2], 86)

not too large, only those transitions take place where just one of the electrons makes
a “jump”, i.e., only one alters its orbital quantum number l by ±1 (see, e.g., [1, 2nd
ed.], p. 85). After initial protest, the scientiﬁc community learned to live with prob-
lems of interpretation by simply ignoring them as best as possible and developing a
rather instrumentalistic attitude ( quantum theory, crisis period). A deeper under-
standing of selection rules and other features of the semi-classical atomic models
only became possible after the discovery of  spin and the advent of quantum me-
chanics in 1925/26. Formerly useful mental models like electron ‘orbits’, ‘jumps’,
etc. no longer made sense because of  Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation. See also
 quantum jump experiments.

The Early History of Quantum Logic
Already in his pioneering work “Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik”
of 1932, J. von Neumann mentioned that projection operators ( projection) in
 Hilbert space correspond to elementary propositions in quantum mechanics, and
that also the logical connectives ∧(and), ∨(or), and ¬ (not) can adequately be ex-
pressed in terms of projection operators. Compared to classical logic, the calculus
of propositions, that is based on projection operators, is essentially restricted by the
mutual commensurability or incommensurability of the propositions in question.
This calculus was investigated more in detail in the work of G. Birkhoff and J.
von Neumann in 1936 [1]. In terms of lattice theory, the authors could show, that
the lattice of quantum mechanical propositions is given by an orthocomplemented
lattice that is not distributive and in general also not modular. The title of their paper
“The logic of quantum mechanics” indicates the similarity and distinctness between
this “logic” and the well known classical proposition logic, which is given by a
Boolean lattice LC.
The lattice of quantum mechanical propositions that correspond to projection
operators in Hilbert space, was further elaborated by Piron [2] and Jauch [3] and
