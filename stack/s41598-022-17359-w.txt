Information flow in first‑order potts 
model phase transition
Joshua M. Brown1*, Terry Bossomaier2 & Lionel Barnett3
Phase transitions abound in nature and society, and, from species extinction to stock market collapse, 
their prediction is of widespread importance. In earlier work we showed that Global Transfer Entropy, 
a general measure of information flow, was found to peaks away from the transition on the disordered 
side for the Ising model, a canonical second order transition. Here we show that (a) global transfer 
entropy also peaks on the disordered side of the transition of finite first order transitions, such as 
ecology dynamics on coral reefs, which have latent heat and no correlation length divergence, and 
(b) analysis of information flow across state boundaries unifies both transition orders. We obtain 
the first information-theoretic result for the high-order Potts model and the first demonstration of 
early warning of a first order transition. The unexpected earlier finding that global transfer entropy 
peaks on the disordered side of a transition is also found for finite first order systems, albeit not in the 
thermodynamic limit. By noting that the interface length of clusters in each phase is the dominant 
region of information flow, we unify the information theoretic behaviour of first and second order 
transitions.
Numerous mechanisms for predicting phase transitions exist, applied, for example, from core science and engi-
neering through biology, ecology, medicine and ­finance1: increased variance; critical slowing ­down1; ­flickering2; 
and a peak in the global transfer entropy (Eq. 2). Two canonical models of equilibrium transitions stand out: 
the Ising ­model3, a binary spin system on a square lattice, where each point on the lattice has a spin, which may 
point up or down; and the Potts model, which generalises Ising to spins with an arbitrary number of states, q, 
and reduces to the Ising model for q = 2.
In the Ising ­model3, mutual information peaks at the transition between ordered and disordered ­phases4,5, 
as does pairwise transfer ­entropy6 (Eq. 4, Suppl. Material), while global transfer entropy (Eq. 2) peaks distinctly 
on the disordered ­side7. Here we extend this prior work on global transfer entropy to the q-state Potts ­model8 
which exhibits first-order phase transitions for q > 49 and provide a unifying framework for both transitions (See 
Suppl. Material for details regarding mutual information in the first-order Potts model). At q = 5 the transition 
is weakly first order10, implying a long correlation length and low latent heat. As q increases the correlation length 
decreases and the latent heat increases. We show that as the system becomes more strongly first order (i.e., q > 7
11,12) the behaviour of global transfer entropy, G , diverges from the second-order behaviour: In the thermody-
namic limit, G becomes discontinuous at the transition temperature, Tc , peaking at T+
c .
The standard Potts model comprises a two-dimensional lattice of spins with periodic boundary conditions and 
size N = L × L , where the system state is s = s1, . . . , sN , with si ∈{1, . . . , q} . The interaction energy between two 
neighbouring sites is Eij = −Jδ(si, sj) giving the Hamiltonian H = −J 
i,j δ(si, sj) , where interaction strength 
J = 1 , δ(x, y) is the Kronecker delta function which is one if x = y and zero otherwise, and ⟨i, j⟩ are all interacting 
pairs of sites in the system. Local site energy, Ei , is defined similarly, fixing i and summing over its four neigh-
bours. The system is updated using Glauber ­dynamics13.
Overall alignment of the lattice is measured by its magnetisation, M = (q · Smsm −1)/(q −1)10, where 
Sm =  δ(sm, si)/N is the proportion of the dominant, mode, state, sm , over all sites for the given configuration of 
the lattice, with Sm ranging from q−1 when all q states are equally represented to 1 where only one state is present 
in the lattice, giving magnetisation in the range [0, 1]. M serves as the order parameter and the order-disorder 
transition occurs—for q = 2 and q ≥4—at an intermediate ­temperature14

where the (thermodynamic) system is disordered ( M = 0 ) at temperatures above Tc and non-zero below Tc . The 
behaviour at Tc defines the transition order, where q ≤4 has continuous M (and discontinuous dM/dT) giving 
a second-order phase transition.
Transfer entropy, T , measures (Eqs. 2, 4, Suppl. Material) information flow from one stochastic process, Y, 
to another, X—in this case the states of two neighbouring spins over time. Global transfer entropy measures the 
average information flow of the entire system to individual spin sites:
We note however, that all information—no matter its origin in the lattice—must flow to si via its neighbours 
or its own past, and thus consider only the immediate neighbourhood of each site (including si ) rather than s in 
Eq. (2)7. As with T , G ≥0 with G = 0 iff each site si , conditioned on its past, is independent of its neighbours.
Methods
Direct simulation of the higher order Potts models is not straightforward, since the first-order transition shows 
a void region of energy space around the phase transition, such that general purpose update schemes, such as 
Glauber dynamics, are very unlikely to enter this region. In fact, for temperatures close to the critical tempera-
ture, the energy distribution P(E) is bimodal (See Suppl. Material, Fig. S1). Thus we estimate G via two methods.
The first, denoted G(g) , employs straight-forward Glauber dynamics where each update, or sweep, comprises 
N spin flip attempts. The second uses the density of states, d(E), calculated with the Wang-Landau ­algorithm15 
(See Suppl. Material). P(E) may then be calculated from
where E is the lattice energy. Any thermodynamic observable, f(T), may now be determined from its value as a 
function of f(E)16
where P′(E) is the distribution of energies, and has been rescaled for visualisation and computational reasons 
(Specifically, normalisation is such that P′(E) = exp

log[gd(E)] −E/[kbT] −max(log[d(E)] −E/[kbT])

 . As 
the new term, max(log[d(E)] −E/[kbT]) , is constant over the summation, it cancels out such that f(T) is 
unmodified.).
After determining d(E) we need to determine G(E) . While f(E) depends on energy only, G is a temporal 
quantity (Eq. 4, Suppl. Material), that is, it is a function of the change in state between t −1 and t, and thus also 
depends on temperature, therefore we in fact need to determine G(E, T) for varying T. Additionally, as P(E) →0 
for many values, f(E) can be measured more simply by culling energy values where P(E) is sufficiently low—that 
is, once d(E) has been determined, and we move to determining G(E, T) , reaching every E is unnecessary and 
so G(E, T) can be calculated via a separate set of realisations utilising only Glauber dynamics rather than Wang-
Landau updating.
We thus collect ensemble statistics similar to G(g) (with fixed T per ensemble), collating statistics for G(E, T) 
using the energy E of the lattice before the Glauber sweep, where the future state is the post-sweep state. We 
denote this regime as G(s) . We note however that this may not be strictly correct, as E can change after each 
successful spin flip during the sweep, thus statistics collated for G(E, T) will include elements from E′ = E . To 
address this, we separately collate statistics on a per-flip basis, where si and its neighbourhood are recorded at 
any attempt to flip si , giving G(f ).
Straight-forward Glauber approaches construct ensembles comprising r = 10 realisations pooled together, 
with settling time of 1000 time steps, followed by a measurement sequence of 105 time steps as in the Ising 
­model7. Standard error calculated by generating 10 ensembles. We optimise simulation by modifying initialisa-
tion dependent on T. In the ordered regime, T < Tc , we initialise all realisations to the same ground state, noting 
that Tc(L) > Tc [p. ­4]17 and thus only the ordered peak exists in P(E) for T < Tc . For T ≥Tc we evenly divide 
realisations into random ground states or random disordered states to sample both P(E) peaks. Density of states 
approaches constructed likewise, minus the superflous (in this regime only) settling time.
Due to data volume requirements involved in estimation of G , G(s) and G(f ) we employ a compression regime 
(explained below in the methodology). This regime is validated by applying it to G(g) , giving G(e) (shown in the 
Suppl. Materials).
Results and discussion
All variants exhibit a peak in G on the disordered side of the transition (Fig. 1), with per-sweep versus per-flip 
statistics differing by a roughly constant factor: the statistics collated for G(s) can be considered equivalent to 
those collated for G(f ) with a small amount of random noise applied, thus reducing the information flow and 
therefore G(s) = cG(f ) , with 0 < c < 1 . The peak locations are mostly stable for the pure Glauber approach, G(g) , 
except for L = 32 , while the thermodynamic, density of states approaches, G(f ), G(s) , exhibit a strong shift in G 
peak as q and lattice sizes increase, rapidly approaching the critical temperature.

The behaviour of the G peak in G(g) compared with the density of states approaches highlights the core issue 
with initialisation regimes and hysteresis. Specifically, for T > Tc the current initialisation regime initialises 
half of the realisations in an ensemble to disordered and the other half to randomly chosen ground states, in an 
attempt to circumvent infeasibly long times to traverse the valley in P(E). This is done under the assumption that 
it achieves bimodal P(E) while rapidly collapsing to the correct unimodal P(E) on either side of Tc(L) . However, 
this collapse is not quick enough. For example, for q = 10 , the normalised ordered peak in P(E) should drop 
below 10−4 at T ≈0.7017 (according to density of states estimation), however, in the Glauber simulation it does 
not reach this threshold until T ≈0.703 . That is, we have a spurious ordered peak above Tc(L) , resulting in an 
artificial reduction in G(g) for Tc(L) < T < ∼0.703 (See Suppl. Materials). Here, by using Eq. (4) directly, as done 
here, we circumvent the issue altogether.
Finally, we look at a physical understanding of the behaviour of G . Intuitively, information flows when neigh-
bour states differ, hence zero information flow in ground states. This behaviour necessarily extends to clusters of 
states, implying information flow occurs on the boundaries, or interfaces, between clusters (See Fig. 2). It seems 
reasonable then to assume that information flow scales with number of interfaces. However, such a maximum 
coincides with the zero-energy fully disordered regime, where quite clearly G = 0 . This assumption neglects the 
temporal nature of G , which is disrupted at high temperature.
Remember that G is a measure of a site’s dependence on neighbouring sites, conditioned on its own past. At 
high temperature, spin flips are essentially random, choosing new states with little influence from neighbours. As 
temperature decreases, neighbour influence increases, leading to clusters of similar sites. We can thus approxi-
mate average influence by probability of cluster size, p(c). This influence is the manifestation of information 
flow in the system, but only along interfaces (since information flow is conditioned on its own past), leading to 
the conjecture:
where Lc is the average interfacial length of cluster of size c. Note however that when clusters get sufficiently 
large—i.e., on the order of system size L—they no longer have an outer perimeter and are instead defined by the 
holes created by other clusters (Fig. 2, bottom). Thus for this dominant cluster to increase in size, the internal 
holes must shrink and its interfacial length Lc actually falls. As temperature decreases, influence increases, but 
the available sites to transfer influence decreases, hence total information flow G falls.
We note that Eq. (5) is essentially the average interface length. There should thus be some relationship between 
average interfacial length and net information flow in the lattice.
The average interface length is defined as:
where NI interfacial lengths are found by performing a “turn-right walk” procedure, similar to ­Saberi18, on every 
unmarked edge between adjoining lattice sites of differing states. Edges are marked during the walk procedure

in association with an adjoining site (such that each edge is ultimately left unmarked or marked twice). This 
prevents a cluster from counting its perimeter (of length Ni ) Ni separate times, but correctly accounts for interface 
boundaries between a cluster and all of its neighbouring clusters. This also addresses clusters with two or more 
disjoint interfaces, i.e., a 2D doughnut.
Interface results, I(T), are calculated from I(E) and Eq. (4) with the weighted Wang-Landau update ­scheme15. 
Each E value sampled at minimum 5000 times, up to a maximum of 10000 samples.
The intuitive interface model of Eqs. (5) and (6), shown in Fig. 3, gives a remarkably good match to the G 
trends, peaking in the disordered regime in all cases, and converging to Tc only where systems become more 
strongly first-order (increased q and increased L for q > 4 ). In the q = 2 Ising case, interface peak location 
remains stable at increasing lattice sizes, as does G peak ­location7.

stable above the phase transition. Note the factor of two difference in temperature for q = 2 and Ising results is

Given the excellent agreement between the average interface length and G , the average interface length is 
a suitable theoretical justification for G , fitting the behaviour for the first- and second-order transitions into a 
single unified framework. It is known that in—at least some class of—second-order phase transitions, that G can 
serve as a predictor for an impending phase transition in systems slowly approaching criticality from the disor-
dered ­regime7, and we show here that the same behaviour is exhibited in the first-order Potts model. Specifically, 
detection of a peak in G while other information theoretic ­metrics7 continue to rise could indicate an imminent 
transition. This behaviour of falling GTE while other information theoretic quantities rise holds most strongly 
for finite-size systems, that is, those with most practical utility, while it’s possible that in at least the q = 10 case 
above, G may converge to Tc in the thermodynamic limit.
