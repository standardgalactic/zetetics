1. Introduction
The study of orbits of symplectic maps under iteration has a rich history mo-
tivated by basic questions in symplectic geometry and their importance in applica-
tions ­ celestial mechanics, plasma physics, accelerator dynamics, condensed matter
physics and fluid flow, for example. The present work is a research monograph that
considers particular interesting questions about symplectic maps on R2n with n
1.
The monograph consists of three parts: a general theory for bifurcating period­q
points of equivariant symplectic maps, introduction of a singularity theory frame-
work for equivariant gradient bifurcation problems which is used to classify singu-
larities of bifurcating period­q points of symplectic maps and thirdly a compendium
­ much of which is contained in a sequence of appendices ­ of basic questions and
results for symplectic maps on R2n and their generating functions.
Symmetry arises in two ways in the analysis of period­q points.
A period­q
orbit of a symplectic map has a natural cyclic (Zq) symmetry; that is, an orbit can
start at any of the q distinct points that make up the period­q orbit. Period­q points
can therefore be characterized as fixed points of a Zq­equivariant map on Rnq. When
the symplectic map is itself equivariant we call this a spatial symmetry (that is, it
is independent of discrete time). A general framework to account for the two types
of symmetry is introduced in Chapters 2 and 8 respectively.
When the map depends on parameters the periodic points will undergo bifur-
cations as the parameters are varied.
To classify the bifurcations we introduce a
singularity theory framework in Chapter 3 with special cases treated in Chapters
4 and 6. These results are self­contained and have general application to the clas-
sification of bifurcations for equivariant gradient maps. In particular, our results
provide a complete theory when the symmetry group is discrete.
Throughout the monograph various questions arise that are of a basic nature
such as the signature and linear stability question for period­q points on configu-
ration space, discrete­time conservation laws, linear normal forms, generating func-
tions and reversibility, multiple resonant Floquet multipliers, dynamical equivalence
and so forth. Each of these topics is treated independently in the appendices.
The classic theory on the bifurcation of period­q points of area­preserving maps
depending on a single parameter ­ generic bifurcation of periodic points ­ is due to
Meyer [1970,1971J with extension to the reversible area­preserving case by Rimmer
[1978,1983J. We extend the basic theory in a number of significant ways. The frame-
work of Meyer does not extend easily to symplectic maps on R2n with n
2. We
introduce a framework for the bifurcation of period­q points based on "Lagrangian

generating functions". Let h(z , x') be a smooth function of x, x' E Rn and suppose
det hxx ' (x, x') =1= 0 then the relations (the notation is described in Chapter 2)
y' = hx'(x,x/)
Y = -hx(x, x')
generate, implicitly, a symplectic map T: (x,y)
f-+ (X',y').
The idea of Lagrangian generating functions for symplectic maps is relatively
new, having been introduced in the late 1970's (Percival [1980], Aubry [1983]).
However, because of their associated variational structure - an orbit of the sym-
plectic map T generated by h(z , x') corresponds to a critical point of the action
W(x) = L:i h(xi , xi+1 ) - Lagrangian generating functions have turned out to be
extremely useful for proving existence of invariant circles, for converse KAM theory
and for transport theories (reviewed in MacKay [1986] and Meiss [1991]). Most of
the above results are for the area-preserving case. It is even more recent that La-
grangian generating functions have been extended to symplectic maps on R:b1 , n
2
(Bernstein & Katok [1987], MacKay, Meiss & Stark [1989], Kook & Meiss [1989],
Meiss [1991]).
For period-q points of symplectic maps on R:b1 we use Lagrangian
generating functions to reduce the existence question to a problem of equivariant
critical point theory. We concentrate in this work on q
3, although in general q
can be any natural number.
The idea is to reduce the question of existence of bifurcating solutions to a
normal form on some low (lowest) dimensional space. For symplectic maps on R:b1,
period-q points correspond to critical points of a functional - the action functional
- on an nq-dimensional space.
We decompose the nq-dimensional space into an
m-dimensional space (typically m = 2 or with symmetry m = 2n) on which the
functional is "singular" and an nq - m dimensional space on which the functional is
nondegenerate. Because of the presence of spatial
and temporal (Zq) symmetries
the action functional is
The Equivariant Splitting Lemma is used to
decompose the action functional into a nondegenerate quadratic functional on Rnq-m
and a reduced functional on Rm that inherits the symmetry of the full problem. This
decomposition is basic to our analysis and with modest assumptions the idea extends
to symplectic maps of arbitrary dimension, to symmetric maps with
a compact
Lie group and to various degeneracies of interest such as the collision of multipliers.
In other words, the existence of bifurcating period-q points is in one-to-one
correspondence with critical points of a
functional on Rm and when
= id m = 2; in particular, the dimension of the reduced space, m, is independent
of the configuration space dimension, n, and the sequence space dimension, q. In
Chapter 2 a generalization of Meyer's theorem is proved on the generic bifurcation
and stability of periodic points in one-parameter symplectomorphisms on R:b1. In
our framework the question reduces to the existence of bifurcating critical points of
an Zq-equivariant gradient map on R2 dependent on a single parameter.

1. INTRODUCTION

In subsequent chapters the theory for bifurcating period-q points is extended
to include
(a) the case where the symplectomorphism depends on more than one pa-
rameter and we classify all possible singularities of bifurcating period-q
points up to codimension 2 (with a precise definition of codimension
given in Chapter 3).
(b) In 4D-symplectomorphisms, the effect of a collision of multipliers of
opposite signature on bifurcating period-q points (Chapters 9-10).
(c) The effect of spatial symmetry on the bifurcation of period-q points
(Chapter 8).
In all cases we "project" the action functional, via the Equivariant Splitting
Lemma, to a reduced 1; X Zq-equivariant gradient map on Rm. In other words the
problem can be reduced to a question in singularity theory.
Suppose we have the simplest case: m = 2, 1; = id and the map depends on a
single parameter oX. From a singularity theory point of view, given a Zq-equivariant
gradient map on R2 , Vxf(x, oX), obtained from a reduction of the action functional
for period-q points, satisfying say
Vx!(O,O) = 0
and
det Hessxf(O, O) = 0,
what is the simplest "normal form" "equivalent" to f(x, A)?
What equivalence
relation is most suitable to the origin of the problem, that is bifurcating period-q
points? Is the germ finitely determined? What are all possible perturbations of f
(universal unfolding) ?
There are various "off the shelf" singularity theory frameworks available. For
example Mather's classic contact-equivalence, without any distinguished parameter
and without a gradient structure, has been used successfully by Hummel [1979] to
classify Zq-equivariant maps on R2 (with an eye towards classifying singularities of
periodic points of (non-symplectic) diffeomorphisms). There is catastrophe theory
- right equivalence - which is natural for maps with a gradient structure. And there
is singularity theory for bifurcation problems - distinguished parameter singularity
theory - of Golubitsky and Schaeffer. In a similar vein the recent developments of
Mond & Montaldi [1991J put special emphasis on the role of parameters and paths
in parameter space.
Periodic points occur generically in one-parameter families of symplectic maps
in the neighborhood of an elliptic fixed point. Therefore it is natural to include a
distinguished parameter in the singularity theory framework. (There are a number
of other arguments in favor of this.
For example if the one-parameter represents
energy of a Hamiltonian system and a bifurcation is associated with increasing
energy the equivalence relation should preserve this orientation.) It is also of interest
to preserve the gradient structure. Therefore the singularity theory framework we

4
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
use is equivariant contact-equivalence with a distinguished parameter that preserves
the gradient structure.
Here, the difficulty is that the set of such contact-equivalences does not form a
nice algebraic structure; in particular, its elements depend on which gradient they
are applied to. But we can circumvent the difficulties and present a new theory, in
Chapter 3, in complete generality for r-equivariant gradient maps on Rm with r a
discrete group.
Then in Chapter 4 the singularity theory is applied to 1 q-equivariant gradient
maps on R2 with a distinguished parameter. This is the basic result necessary for
the classification of the singularities of bifurcating period-q points.
In Chapters 5 and 7 the singularities of two-parameter area-preserving maps are
considered; that is, when certain coefficients, in the normal form for generic (one-
parameter) period-q points, go through zero the structure of the bifurcating period-q
points changes. In particular there are folds, symmetry-breaking bifurcations and
secondary bifurcations of periodic points.
It should be noted as well that rigorous results on (linear) stability are obtained
in the case where the reduced functional is on R2 using a generalization of the
MacKay-Meiss formula (see Appendix B) and projecting onto the normal form space.
In this way we are able to track the effect of degenerate bifurcations, in 2-parameter
maps, on the stability configurations.
In Chapter 8 the effect of spatial symmetries on bifurcating period-q points is
considered. As far as we are aware this is the first work on equivariant symplecto-
morphisms with nontrivial spatial symmetries; in particular continuous symmetries.
This is surprising as equivariant symplectic maps are quite important in applica-
tions. Simple examples giving rise to equivariant symplectic maps can be obtained
by parametrically forcing some of the classical problems in mechanics such as the
spherical pendulum and the rigid body. In Section 8.4 we show for example how
the periodic points of an O(2)-equivariant symplectic map are related to the dy-
namics of a parametrically forced spherical pendulum. A phase space of at least 4
dimensions (2D-configuration space) is necessary for non-trivial configuration space
symmetries. An area-preserving map for example has only a one-dimensional confi-
guration space: hence, the only nontrivial spatial symmetries are equivalent to 1 2 in
which case the bifurcations are not significantly different from those of a reversible
area-preserving map.
Let T : (x, y) f-+ (x', y') be a
symplectic map with a
fixed point and suppose there is a bifurcation of period-q points from the fixed
point. Then a basic question is: how much of
x 1 q is inherited by the branches of
bifurcating period-q points? This is a question of spontaneous symmetry breaking.
A related but more abstract question is: given a spatial symmetry
how many
distinct families of period-q points can we expect to bifurcate? We will take two ap-
proaches to this problem in Chapter 8. First, using a minimal amount of information

about the
symplectomorphism (spatial-temporal symmetry and gradi-
ent structure) and suitable non-degeneracy hypotheses, we use topological results -
results based on r-Iength of sets of Bartsch [1992b], Bartsch & Clapp [1990] (among
others) or equivariant Lusternik-Schnirelman category - to obtain lower bounds on
the number of geometrically distinct branches of bifurcating period-q points and
their symmetry group. This idea is reminiscent of the classical "Weinstein-Moser"
theory for periodic orbits of continuous-time Hamiltonian systems and generalizes
to the subharmonic case a theorem of Montaldi, Roberts & Stewart [1988] on bifur-
cation of periodic solutions from symmetric equilibria of Hamiltonian vectorfields.
When the spatial symmetry
acts absolutely irreducibly on the configuration
space of the symplectic map, the results on bifurcation of period-q points can be
sharpened. In particular, for every isotropy subgroup IT C
x Zq with Weyl group
WIT
NIT/IT (where NIT is the normalizer of IT in
x Zq) there exist at least
catwrrFix IT WIT-orbits of bifurcating period-q points whose symmetry group is at
least IT (catwrrFix IT denotes the WIT-category of the unit sphere in Fix IT).
This result is straightforward to apply. For example, it is used in Section 8.3
to classify bifurcating period-q points of 0(2)-equivariant symplectomorphisms; in
particular, for each q
3 there are 3 geometrically distinct conjugacy classes. In
cases where dim (Fix IT) = 2 we can restrict to the fixed-point subspace and again
apply the singularity theory of Chapter 4 to obtain more precise information on the
branches of period-q points. This program is carried out for
= 0(2) in Section
8.3.
When a symplectomorphism has a continuous symmetry then we expect an
associated conserved quantity. For symplectic maps with a Lagrangian generating
function it is particularly easy to prove - via a discrete version of Noether's Theorem
- that every continuous spatial symmetry generates a conserved quantity.
This
result is proved in Appendix E. When applied to the 0(2)-equivariant map on R4
is shows that, generically, every orbit of the map lies on an invariant submanifold
that is equivalent to the interior of a solid torus! This leads to interesting geometric
structures in the phase space.
In the case of the parametrically forced spherical
pendulum the conserved quantity of the symplectic map is a discrete analog of the
angular momentum of the pendulum.
For the 0(2)-equivariant symplectic map
we give results for the period-q points only, but they are quite suggestive about
other interesting dynamics - invariant circles that ride on the group orbit, drift of
structures transverse to the group orbit, etc. - of equivariant symplectic maps.
One of the original motivations for this study was to understand the collision of
multipliers singularity in symplectic maps. The collision of multipliers of opposite
signature is one of the three ways that a one-parameter family of periodic orbits
in a Hamiltonian system can lose stability and it is the most difficult to analyze
because it involves the bifurcation of invariant tori. Just before a collision, when
the multipliers are distinct and sufficiently irrational, we expect - by KAM theory - a

surrounding invariant 2-torus (in the map) but, in some sense, the 2-torus collapses
to a I-torus (an invariant circle), at the collision, that mayor may not vanish after
the collision. Our idea is to treat the two-parameter problem and give a complete
treatment of the collision of multipliers at rational points.
We will see that for
B = 71r, and q sufficiently large we get a rough idea about the structure of the
irrational collision.
The collision of multipliers in symplectomorphisms is the analogue of the colli-
sion of purely imaginary eigenvalues in the vectorfield case (Meyer & Schmidt [1971J,
Sokol'skij [1974J, van del' Meer [1985], Bridges [1990,1991]). In fact, consider the
linear normal form for the collision of purely imaginary eigenvalues in a Hamiltonian
vectorfield,
with
A o =

with B E R and to= ±1. Exponentiation of JAo then yields the linear normal form
for a collision of multipliers in symplectic maps on R4 (see Appendix D),

with
M o = exp(JAo) =
where RII is the rotation matrix.
Note that the value of B (the frequency) is not
particularly important in the vectorfield case but has great importance in the map
case (rotation number).
An unfolding of A o is given by
(
aI
A(A,a)=
(B+A)J
-(B+A)J)
d
.
However exponentiation of A(A,a) leads to M(A,a) = exp(JA(A,a)) which de-
pends nonlinearly on a. We prove (Proposition 9.1) that an equivalent unfolding of
M o in Sp(4, R) is
M(A,a) = ((1 + W)RII+A
aRII+A
The 2-parameter matrix M( A,a) is in general position for a collision of multipliers
at rational points (for a collision at irrational points A can be taken to be zero. On
the other hand a more complete analysis of the structure of the irrational collision
is obtained with the two parameters.) and is the starting point for our theory. In
particular, for (A,a) sufficiently small we study bifurcating period-q points of the
map Zn+l = M(A, a) Zn + h.o.t.. Linear stability results for the bifurcating period-
q points near a collision turn out to be difficult but we make some headway on
this problem in Sections 9.5 and 9.6.
A sufficient condition for linear instability
is obtained in Section 9.5.
In Section 9.6 a linear stability theory for bifurcating
period-4 points - in the unfolding of the collision at ±i - is presented. Here the

1. INTRODUCTION
7
interesting result is that there is always a secondary irrational, small-angle collision
along one of the globally connected branches.
Of crucial importance for the study of multiplier collision is the signature of
multipliers and we obtain new results on signature in configuration space for La-
grangian generating functions and this material is recorded in Appendix B.
Surprisingly there has not been much work on the bifurcation of symplectomor-
phisms near a collision of multipliers. The linear theory (normal form and signature
theory) has been well understood for some time but the nonlinear problem is difficult
because it involves the bifurcation of invariant tori in the map. Recent results of
Bridges & Cushman [1993J and Bridges, Cushman & MacKay [1993] use normal form
theory and Poisson reduction to obtain a geometrical picture in the phase space for
the irrational collision. There are interesting numerical calculations on the bifurca-
tions near irrational and rational collisions by Pfenniger [1985,1987]. For reversible
(but non-symplectic) diffeomorphism the collision of multipliers singularity also oc-
curs. Recent results on the collision of multipliers in one-parameter reversible maps
have been reported by Sevryuk & Lahiri [1991] and Bridges, Cushman & MacKay
[1993, Section 4].
Finally in Chapter 10 we consider equivariant symplectic maps with a collision
of multipliers. We are mainly interested here in admissible spatial symmetries that
do not prevent the basic collision in 4D-maps. The simplest additional symmetry
is reversibility.
However reversibility has little effect on the collision: extra Z2 in
the normal form and extra symmetry in the sequences of period-q points, but the
normal form and local geometric structure in the neighborhood of the collision is
similar to the non-reversible case. On the other hand non-reversible symplectomor-
phisms admit a larger group of spatial symmetries which in turn leads to interesting
structures in the neighborhood of a collision.
Admissible spatial symmetries, for
symplectomorphisms on R4, include 50(2), Zm, m 2: 2, and Z2 x Z2. The group
50(2) has the most dramatic effect on the collision (surprisingly, it does not elimi-
nate the collision) because of the presence of a continuous symmetry and we analyze
the SO(2)-symmetric collision in some detail.
Throughout, unless otherwise mentioned (see remarks in Appendix I), the sym-
plectic form is taken to be the standard one:

The term symplectomorphism is now becoming standard, especially in the Rus-
sian literature: the terms symplectomorphism and symplectic map are used inter-
changeably throughout the text.
The symplectic maps and generating functions
are assumed to be as smooth as necessary. Our analyses are local: we work in the
neighborhood of fixed points throughout (this avoids questions of global existence of
generating functions and makes it convenient to work with germs) and have found it
convenient to express the phase space and configuration space variables in Euclidean
coordinates ­ rather than action­angle variables.

2. Generic bifurcation of periodic points
Let T : (x, y, A)
1-+ (x', y') be a smooth family of symplectic maps on R2n
depending on a multidimensional parameter A and suppose that T has a fixed point
(which without loss of generality can be taken to be the origin) when A = 0.
There are several ways for the parameters to affect T but, to fix the ideas, we
have chosen the following "canonical" splitting of the parameter space:
A=
where j is a control (multi)parameter for the linear part in (x, y) of T at the origin,
•
def
DT(A) = D(x,y)T(O,O, A) E Sp(2n,R). The (multi)parameter,8 controls only the
coefficients of the higher order terms of T and so is considered as a perturbation
(unfolding) parameter.
Typically j controls the eigenvalues of DT around the resonances provoking
the bifurcations and so, generically, >. is unidimensional, denoted by A. Otherwise >.
is itself split into (A, a) where Ais the main bifurcation parameter and a is another
perturbation parameter (cf. Section 2.6 on the collision of multipliers).
Although
A can conceivably be taken to be multidimensional, in this work we are going to
consider only A E R. Together, (A,a) control the (multi)parameter unfolding of the
linear part DTo in the sense of Arnold [1988]. By perturbation/unfolding parameter
we mean that we consider 0',,8 as fixed with respect to the variation of A.
Suppose that the origin is an elliptic fixed point of T when A = 0, say.
In
particular, for DTo
DT(O ... 0) we assume that
u(DTO)={e±ilh,... ,e±illn }
,
()j=2rrpj
and
pjE(O,t),
(2.1)
In that case, a simple application of the Implicit Function Theorem shows that
locally (in a neighborhood of the origin) T has an unique family of fixed points,
which we can consider to be parametrized by >.. Generically for a one-parameter
family each multiplier in u(DT(A)) lies at an irrational point: Pj E (0, t) \ Q for
almost all values of A. But, at particular values of A, individual multipliers may lie
at rational points.
Suppose that when A =°one of the multipliers lies at a rational point and the
remaining n - 1 multipliers lie at irrational points. Without loss of generality, take

SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
The assumption (2.1) is not a necessary condition for bifurcation of period-q
points. The requirement that all multipliers lie on the unit circle is not essential
but makes the discussion of stability worthwhile, as all periodic points in the neigh-
borhood of a fixed point with a pair of multipliers outside the unit circle are, by
continuity, unstable. In other words, the existence theory for period-q points is not
affected by the presence of multipliers outside (or inside) the unit circle, although
such periodic points will be unstable.
The hypothesis (RO) is introduced to simplify some technical details of the
exposition. More general situations, such as additional multipliers at rational points
or higher multiplicities, can be treated either with a "Weinstein-Moser"-type of
theory (d. Section 8.1) or adapted from the framework introduced in this chapter.
For instance, if another multiplier is at a rational point, say;, our results hold true
if s > q.
On the other hand, there may be additional periodic points of period
s, ... ,gcm(q, s). The problem is thus best treated in the space of period-gcm(q, s)
orbits (see Appendix J for mode interactions). Results on stability also hold true in
this context if there are no multiplier collisions and no resonances.
In this chapter we introduce a framework for the bifurcation of periodic points
and give a new proof of Meyer's theorem (Meyer [1970,1971]) on the bifurcation and
stability of period-q points. In particular, in the one-parameter family of symplectic
twist maps T(A) with DTo satisfying (2.1), with the hypothesis (RO), and assuming
the multiplier passes through the rational point with nonzero speed, there is a
bifurcation of period-q points associated with the multiplier with exponent (}l = 2p tt .

2.1 Lagrangian variational formulation
To study the existence and stability of period-q points, the symplectic map
will be identified with an underlying variational structure given by a generating
function.
In particular, what we will show (Proposition 2.1) is that at an elliptic
point there always exists, at least locally, a Lagrangian generating function with an
associated variational principle. That is, for symplectic maps in the neighborhood
of an elliptic fixed point, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the orbits of
the map and critical points of a Lagrangian generating function (see also remarks in
Appendix G on twist maps) First we introduce some basic facts about Lagrangian
generating functions for symplectic maps on R2n following MacKay, Meiss & Stark
[1989, Appendix A].
Let T : (x,y,A) -4 (x',y') be a smooth A-parametrized family of symplectic
maps on R2n ; that is DT(x,y,A) E Sp(2n,R) and let
1rx,1ry

jection operators taking R2n onto the first and second n components respectively:
1rx (x , y) = x and 1ry(x , y) = y. Suppose

where IAI denotes the determinant of the matrix A, then there exists a Lagrangian
variational formulation associated with T. In particular, there exists a generating
function h(x, x' , A) with
y = -\1xh(x,x',A)
-hl(x,x',A)
y' = \1x,h(x, x', A)
h2(x,x',A)
and in terms of h the condition (2.2) becomes
Ih12(x,x',A)1 f. o.

(2.3b)
(2.4)
When h satisfies the condition (2.4), the relations (2.3) define implicitly a family of
symplectic maps (x,y,A) f-+ (x',y') on R2n .
The generating function h can be used to define a gradient structure through
the action:
N-I
W(M,Nj{X,A) = L h(xi,xi+I,A)
i=M

where
x = {x L=M'
Note that, at fixed A, the orbit by T of the point (x M, yM) E R2n from time M to
time N is the sequence {x i , yi} defined by
(xi+l,yi+l) = T(xi,yi,A) ,
M::::: i::::: N -1.
In terms of the action however the orbit corresponds to the sequence {xi} in confi-
guration space for which the action is stationary for all finite segments (with respect
to variations that fix x M and x N ) (see also remarks in Appendix G on dynamical
equivalence). Let

However, from equation (2.3), h1(xi,x·+I,A) = _yi and h2(Xi-l,xi,A) = s', that
is, an orbit of the symplectic map generated by h corresponds to a path of stationary
action. Conversely, given a function h satisfying the condition (2.4), the relations

If in fact there exists a generating function h (see Proposition 2.1), then in the
neighborhood of an elliptic fixed point we can take, without loss of generality, hO =

2.2 Linearization and unfolding
When the spectrum of DTo is given by (2.1) and one of the multipliers lies at
a rational point the matrix is not stable under perturbation in Sp(2n, R).
Proposition 2.2. Suppose DTo E Sp(2n,R) has the spectrum given by (2.1) and
satisfies (HO).
Then DTo is of codimension 1 in Sp(2n, R) and a miniversal un-
folding is given by MO, in (2.9), with 81 replaced by 81 -
A, which we denote by
M(A).
Proof. The idea is to give a proof in the Lie algebra of Sp(2n, R). Note that
with
DO=diag(EI81, ... ,En8n).

SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
When 91 = 21rP1 and PI lies at a rational point, any small perturbation of DO will
perturb the multiplier to an irrational point whereas a multiplier at an irrational
point is stable under perturbation.
Therefore an unfolding of DO in sp(2n, R) is
given by perturbing 91 to 91 - A. Then exponentiation of J (9 D(A) results in M(A) .•
To revise (2.10) to take account of the unfolding of the rational multiplier 91 ,
take A(>.) and B(>.) to be A and B given in (2.10) with (}1 replaced by (}1 - A. This
means that we have thus chosen the direction of variation of our main bifurcation
parameter >.. In practical terms there is no problem in changing coordinates to adapt
to this situation. Such a coordinate transformation will in general bring A into the
higher order terms which usually already depend on the perturbation parameter /3.
Then the period-q points of the map T are critical points of

The matrix rq is the fundamental circulant matrix (Davis [1979]) on Rq. It is a
q x q permutation matrix satisfying r: = I q (I q is the identity on Rq); in particular,
it is the generator for a representation of the abelian group Zq on Rq which will
be of fundamental importance in the sequel. We will come back to a discussion of
symmetries shortly but first we consider the spectral analysis of the operator LO.

2.3 Symmetries
Crucial to the subsequent analysis is the role of temporal and spatial symme-
tries. The operator f q (>9 In generates an action for Zq on X; and the functional Wq
is Zq-invariant; that is,
Wq(fq (>9 In' x, A) =! (fq (>9 In' x, L(>')r, (>9 In' x) + N(fq (>9 In' X, A)
=! (X, L(>')x) + N(x,A)
=: Wq(x, A).
It follows that period-q points of the symplectic map T generated by h are critical
points of a Zq-invariant functional.

SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS

a reversor on X;, denoted by K q®In . The reversor generates an action for the group

Clearly Kq satisfies

the interesting relation K q = 'F
2 where F is the Fourier matrix. Together rq ® In
and Kq ® In generate an action on X; for the dihedral group of 2q elements,
(2.22)
This follows from the identity KqrqKq = r'{. In particular, period-q points of a
reversible-symplectic map T generated by h are critical points of a Oq-invariant
functional. Note that a necessary and sufficient condition for the linear operator
L =r, ® (A + C) - r q ® B - r{ ® B T
to commute with the action of Oq is that B = B T . Similar restrictions are neces-
sary for Oq-invariance of the higher-order terms of h. Note that the normal form
(2.9) is also reversible as B is diagonal, but might have been obtained through a
nonreversible symplectic transformation S. Hence, in that case, the additional infor-
mation we have gained from reversibility loses any meaning for the original system.
It is only when we start off with a reversible map T that the action of Oq has full
power (d. Theorem 2.9, Chapter 7 and Appendix F).
The tensor product decomposition of the group action of Zq and Dq reflects the
spatio-temporal symmetry structure. The Zq-symmetry for example is a temporal
8ymmetry. The fact that the generating function h does not have any particular
spatial symmetry is reflected by the identity acting on Rn in the representations
rq ® In and Kq ® In. Spatial symmetries are associated with a group action on Rn
that is independent of discrete time.
We say that the symplectic map generated by h has spatial 8ymmetry
if
h(ux,ux',A) = h(x,x',A),
Vu
We consider orthogonal actions of E. In consequence, note that, as
acts diagonally
on R2n , it also acts symplectically with respect to J 2n • We refer to Appendix I for
a discussion of the relation between symmetry and the symplectic form.

2. GENERIC PERIODIC POINTS

When the generating function has spatial symmetry
the functional Wq on
X; is then
x Zq-invariant (or
Dq if it is also Z2-invariant, d.
Appendix K)
where
x r, = { (rt 129 u) I 0 :s: j :s: q - 1, a E
}.
The role of spatial symmetries, in particular continuous spatial symmetries, in the
bifurcation of period-q points, and the dynamics in general, in symplectic maps is
an interesting subject. The bifurcation of periodic points in equivariant symplectic
maps is considered in Chapter 8. In the remainder of this chapter however, we will
suppose that the given symplectic map has no particular spatial symmetry, and will
restrict attention to temporal symmetries.
Proposition 2.5. The actions of Zq = (rq 129 In) and Z2 = (K q 129 In) on Ker LO =

2.4 Normal form for bifurcating period-q points
•
We now study critical points of the functional Wq given in (2.10). By Corollary
2.4 the Hessian of Wq evaluated at x = A = 0, LO, is singular with a 2-dimensional
kernel. The idea is to use the Equivariant Splitting Lemma (see Appendix A) to
split the functional Wq into a non-degenerate part to which Morse theory applies
and a singular part, defined on the nullspace of LD, to which singularity theory will
be applied. First we establish a preliminary result.
Proposition 2.6. Let Wq be a smooth real valued potential defined on R2 x Rk and
suppose that Wq is Zq-invariant with respect to the standard action on R2 •
Then
there exists smooth function germs F, G such that
with
Wq(X, A) = F(u,v,A) +wG(u,v,A)
u = xi +
and
v +iw = (Xl +in)q.
(2.24)
(2.25)
In addition, if Wq is Z2-invariant, with Z2 = (K) (cf. (2.29)), then G == 0; that is,
Wq(X, A) = F(u,v,A).
(2.26)

SINGULARlTIES .. , SYMPLECTIC MAPS
Proof. The functions u, v and W form a Hilbert basis for the Zq-invariants on R2 •
The expression (2.24) then follows from Schwartz's Theorem (Golubitsky, Stewart
& Schaeffer [1988, p.43]) and the fact that there is a relation:
v 2 + w 2 =
u q• In
particular every smooth Zq-invariant map on R2 can be expressed in the form (2.24).
IfWq is also Z2'-invariant note that
K' W(Xl' X2) = Im(Xl - iX2)q = -W(Xl' X2)'
Therefore w 2 (and not w) is an invariant function but, using the relation w 2
u q - v2 , the expression (2.26) follows.

The following Theorem is a generalization of Meyer's Theorem on the generic bifur-
cation of period-q points.

on R2n with its linear part depending on one parameter A: DT(A)(O,O) = M(A)
with M(A) as given in Proposition 2.2. Then, for (1Ixll, IAI) sufficiently small, there
exists an unique Zq-orbit of bifurcating period-q points which are in one-to-one cor-
respondence with critical points of a Zq -invariant functional on R2 given by
and satisfying
Wq(X, A) = F(u,v,A) + wG(u,v,A)

and in the one bifurcation parameter family it can be assumed that
.(F,,02+G02) =J
0. The remainder of the proof is an application of singularity theory to Wq • In the
expression given in (2.29) we anticipate the singularity theory to be introduced in
Chapters 3 and 4; in particular, the normal forms (2.29) are a direct consequence
of Corollary 4.3.
•
Although the above proof is new, the normal forms for bifurcating period-q
points given in (2.29) are well-known and have been derived using other methods
in Meyer [1970) and Arnold et al. [1988, Section 7.4) and the bifurcation diagrams
are familiar. An important "corollary" of our result however is that the framework
introduced here admits generalization in a number of interesting directions.
Because of the quadratic term in the normal form, the bifurcating period-3
points are unstable (see Stability Lemma I) but very often the symplectic map
has an involution (not to be confused with reversibility) which changes the normal
form for generic bifurcation of period-3 points. This fact has often been observed
in numerical calculations using an even generating function for an area-preserving
map. The following result indicates how such an involution enters the normal form.

Corollary 2.8. Let T: (x,y,A)
f--+ (x',y') be a A-parametrized family of symplectic
maps on R2n satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 2.7. Suppose moreover that h has
a Z; -spatial symmetry; that is,
h({x"x',A) = h(x,x',A)
with
,2 = In
and that, acts nontrivially on e1 E ROl, that is 1;IKer La = (-I).
Then if q = 3
the reduced functional is 16 -invariant. In particular, generically, (V'xW3 ....., g;
with
where 1'1 is the signature of the multiplier and 1'2 = ±1 is determined by the nonlinear
terms in the generating function.
Proof.
Since Z; commutes with 13 the reduced functional is Z2 x Z3-invariant;
but 12 x 13 is isomorphic to 1 6 . The normal form g for V'xW3 then follows from
application of the singularity theory for Z6-equivariant gradient maps.
•
Corollary 2.8 can be extended to arbitrary q but is of less interest when q 2': 4.
In fact when q is even, -I E Zq, and so the effect of the involution is vacuous. When
q 2': 5 is odd the normal form is modified as in Corollary 2.8 and the parity p in
() = 71r must be considered. But the effect is not as dramatic. When q = 3, we
obtain not only new stable points but the overall aspect of the bifurcation is altered,
whereas when q 2': 5 we simply double the number of points (cf. Chapter 4).
The 1;-symmetry in Corollary 2.8 is a spatial symmetry. Another involutive
symmetry of great interest is that of reversibility which is a temporal symmetry.
As previously mentioned, the linear map M(..\) given in Proposition 2.2 is also re-
versible. However a nonlinear map that is reversible-symplectic with its linearization
DT(..\)(O,O) equal to M(..\) will have slightly different normal forms for the bifurca-
ting period-q points. The following theorem generalizes Rimmer's Theorem (Rim-
mer [1983]) on the generic bifurcation of period-q points in reversible-symplectic
maps.
Theorem 2.9. Suppose T is a reversible-symplectic A-parametrized family of maps
on R2n with DT(..\)(O,O) = M(..\) with M(..\) given in Proposition 2.2.

one bifurcation parameter, ..\, is that there are more equivalence classes in the Dq-
case but only trivially so, in the sense that there are additional signs in the normal
forms but no essential difference in the bifurcation diagrams.
However, in the degenerate case (additional parameters) differences do show up
in the bifurcation diagrams. Examples are given in Chapters 5 and 7.
Nevertheless, in all (also generic) cases, there is a nontrivial difference in the
phase portraits for the reversible and nonreversible (symplectic) case. In particular
the involution 12 and its conjugates result in symmetry planes in the phase space.
In addition the sequences of period-q orbits have additional symmetry.
This is
discussed further in Chapter 7.
The fact that the coefficient F0. in the reduced functional Wq is the signature of
the multiplier is extremely important. As we show in Section 2.6 (see also Appendix
B) the signature goes to zero at an indefinite collision of multipliers. In particular
the collision of multipliers at rational points is associated with the collision singu-
larity:
F0. = O.
2.5 Reduced stability of bifurcating periodic points
The idea of reduced stability is to obtain complete information on the linear
stability of the bifurcating period-q points from the reduced functional Wq on R2 .
Lemma 2.10 (Stability Lemma I). Let W q be the reduced functional governing the
bifurcation of period­q points given by Theorem 2.7 or 2.9 and let Hessj,Wq(X, A) be
the Hessian evaluated at an existing period­q point. Then for IIxll and IAI sufficiently
small the bifurcating period­q points are stable if [Hess.,Wq(x, A)I > 0 and unstable
if IHessxWq(x, A)I < o.
Remark.
The result is actually more general than the situation presented by
Theorems 2.7 and 2.9 in the sense that the Stability Lemma I is a reduced stability
result for any non-degenerate bifurcating branch of period-q points provided we have

SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
only a pair of simple multipliers crossing a q-th root of unity (no resonances). In
particular it is also applicable to the more complex bifurcations that take place in
symplectic maps with the unfolding of degenerate nonlinearities (see Chapters 5 and
7).
The instability part of the result of Lemma 2.10 is also a simple consequence
of the general Instability Lemma of Appendix M.
Proof.
The idea of the proof is to use Floquet theory in configuration space
(MacKay & Meiss [1983], Kook & Meiss [1989]) and then project onto Ker LO.

The matrix E ql is a qx q matrix with 1 in the (q, 1)-entry and zero otherwise. In

For a period-q orbit there will be n pairs of multipliers associated with the
symplectic map on R2n • However, for Ilxll and IAI sufficiently small, we can argue
that the n multipliers will be perturbations of the case (X,A) = (0,0), hence
when DT has the form given in (2.1).

When a multiplier lies on the unit circle at a point other than ±1, the residue

Figures 2.1 and 2.2(a),(b), R1 is respectively 0, negative and positive (and less than

period-q orbit is stable if 11!=1 Rk > 0 and unstable if 11!=1 Rk < O.

2.6 4D-symplectic maps and the collision singularity
In the area-preserving case, singularities in the bifurcation of period-q points
are associated with certain coefficients in the nonlinear terms passing through zero.
These singularities are considered in Chapters 5 and 7. With an increase in the
configuration space to two-dimensions, corresponding to 4D-maps, a number of new
and interesting questions arise in the bifurcation of period-q points:
(a) the collision of multipliers of opposite signature at rational points,
(b) the bifurcation of periodic points for equivariant symplectic maps; in particular,
symplectic maps with continuous spatial symmetries.
Both of these subjects will be considered in the sequel. Here we introduce some
preliminary facts about 4D-maps, in particular, the role of signature in the collision
of multipliers that is central to the later analysis.
Let n = 2 and consider a smooth generating function at an elliptic point with
hO =

The quadratic part of the generating function h(x, x') in (2.40) corresponds to
the map

from which it follows that

Tr DT = Tr (B-1(A + C))
Tr (DT 0 DT) = Tr (B-1(A + C))2 - 2Tr(B-1BT ) .

The reduced characteristic equation for DT formed from IDT - JlI4 1 = 0 is given
by
p2 _ Tr (B- 1(A + C))p + IB- 1(A + C)I -

(2.43)
where p = Jl + Jl-1. Let a = Tr DT and 2b= (Tr DT)2 - Tr (DT 0 DT) then (2.43)
becomes
p2 _ ap + b - 2 = 0
and the familiar stability diagram for 4D-symplectic maps is recovered and is shown
in Figure 2.3 (Howard & MacKay [1987, p.1041]). The stable region is the closed
region in the center where both (pairs) of multipliers lie on the unit circle. Passage
through the lines b + 2 = 2a or b + 2 = -2a results in a multiplier passing through
+1 or -1 (period doubling) respectively.
Both of these bifurcations are familiar
in area-preserving maps. Of great interest is the loss of stability associated with a
collision of multipliers along the curve b = 2 + i-a2 (a E (-4,4)). The collision of
multipliers of opposite signature at rational points will be treated in Chapter 9.
The required results on signature in configuration space are given in Appendix
B. In particular, it is demonstrated (Proposition B.3) that the signature of a simple
multiplier on the unit circle: eiO, e E (0,11"), is given by
(

Now suppose that u(DTO) = {e±iO,e±i4>} with e,¢> E (0,11") but ¢> at an irra-
tional point, e = 2: 11" and that T generated by h. If the hypotheses of Theorem
2.7 are met, we know that generically there exists a bifurcating branch of period-
q points. It is also clear that the signature is important, it appears as a critical
coefficient in the reduced functional (see equation (2.28)). We give a direct proof
of the role of the signature in order to show that the coefficient vanishes (signature
function goes to zero) if a multiplier of opposite signature collides with the basic
multiplier.

point (the sign of Q) determines the sign of the coefficient of AU in the reduced
functional. It is shown in Appendix B that at a collision of multipliers of opposite
signature Q -+ O.
•
The central observation of Proposition 2.11 is the role of the collision singularity.
When two multipliers of opposite signature collide at a rational point, the dimension
of the nullspace of the linear operator LO does not increase; the effect of the collision
is to cause a singularity in the parameter structure instead. Therefore the normal
form for bifurcating period-q points at a rational collision is a Zq-equivariant gradient
map on R2 but with the collision singularity.
We will come back to this point
in Chapter 9 after we have explored some other singularities and introduced the
necessary singularity theory.

3. Singularity Theory for
Equivariant Gradient Bifurcation Problems
In this chapter we introduce a singularity theory framework for f-equivariant
gradient bifurcation problems. Let I : Rn x R -+ R be a f-invariant germ with I'
acting orthogonally on Rn and trivially on parameters. Then \lxl is a f-equivariant
map and we say that
\lxl(x, A) = 0
with
\lx/(O,O) = 0
and
l\l; 1(0,0)1 = 0
(3.1)
IS a f-equivariant gradient bifurcation problem.
The function I is the potential
of the bifurcation problem and A E R is the bifurcation parameter. In bifurcation
problems the changes ofthe solution set of \lxl(x, A) = 0 as Achanges are of interest;
that is, it is important to preserve the A-slices of the zero-set. In other words, it is
required to preserve both the gradient structure and certain directions in parameter
space and this dual requirement leads to the greatest technicalities in the theory.
It would seem that a natural singularity theory framework for such germs is
equivariant right equivalence for potentials with some special consideration for the
parameter A.
To be precise define t{>. to be the set of A-dependent f-invariant
germs,
= { h(X,A) I h: (Rn+1,O) -+ Rand h(rX,A) = h(X,A) , "IT E r }.
Then a natural equivalence relation on
is f-right equivalence preserving A-slices
I(x, A) = 9(X(X, A),A(A»)
(3.2)
where 1,9 E
and (I,X,A) E KI. KI is a contact group to be defined shortly
(see paragraph including equation (3.3». We will refer to the equivalence in (3.2)
as f-right equivalence for bifurcation problems and denote the group associated
with it by 'R.I. Although the 'R.I-theory has an elegant simplicity, it turns out to
inadequate.
It is readily demonstrated that if 1,9 E
and I is 'R.I-equivalent to 9 then
\lx/ is contact equivalent to \lx9 (simply differentiate (3.2». The problem is that
the converse is not true in general.
There are two distinct difficulties with the
'R.I-theory which involve different levels of complexity.
The first (simple) obstruction is associated with the difference between contact
equivalence (Kr) of gradients and right equivalence ('R.r) of potentials and does not
involve the distinguished parameter.
In particular 'R.r-equivalence can introduce

34
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
moduli (parameters that cannot be scaled away by a smooth change of coordinates)
that are irrelevant in the context of Kr-equivalence.
This is easily seen in the
following example of Hummel [1979, p.155].
Let u = zz and v = i(zS + ZS) be the Os-invariants on R2 (see Proposition
2.6 or Chapter 6) and consider the Os-invariant potential rPm = u2+ m v2. In the
setting of Os-right equivalence (RP3), positive m are real moduli and so for positive
m i= n rPm is not R D 3- equivalent to rPn.
However, introduction of simple scalings
on the domain and range shows that, for all positive m, 'lxrPm = 4u z + 6mvz2 is
Os-contact equivalent to 4u z + 6v Z2 (the gradient of the potential rPl = u2+ v2).
The second, more fundamental, difficulty with
is that the single
change of coordinates (X, A) in (3.2) is too restrictive when the parameter A is
distinguished. In particular, singularities of infinite codimension arise immediately,
even in the simplest context.
For example, suppose r is trivial and consider the potential fI(x,A) = tx4+
iAx2 which corresponds to the pitchfork 'lxfI
=
xS + AX.
Using distinguished
parameter contact equivalence (K A) the pitchfork is codimension 2 but in the R A-
context fI is of infinite codimension! A similar, somewhat more immediate fact is
that x4+ xS + AX is KA-contact equivalent to xS + AX but, at the potential level,
iX5+ tx4+ px2 is not RA-equivalent to t x4+ px2.
The modal obstruction is more of a nuisance than a serious difficulty: it intro-
duces unnecessary distinctions in the classification. The second difficulty is funda-
mental however as it precludes finite codimension. In the case of the pitchfork the
difficulties can be circumvented by using left-right equivalence (AD with parame-
ters. The classical theory of left-right equivalence (A; independent change of coor-
dinates at the source and image) also preserves the zero-set of the gradient (recall
that we are only interested in controlling what happens to the zero-set of the gra-
dient). The correct results for the pitchfork are recovered if we use
(that is A-parametrized left-right equivalence) for potentials.
On the other hand,
this is again not a satisfactory solution for a general approach.
For instance the
tends to increase much more rapidly than the
and
actually, in most cases we still cannot get finite
This can be ea-
sily checked on problems with two space variables without symmetry or on most
problems with nontrivial symmetries.
Another approach is to use the concept of paths in the parameter space. The
basic idea was suggested in Golubitsky & Schaeffer [1979] and has been extended
and applied to some bifurcation problems in R2 (without symmetry) by Zuppa
[1984]. In those two works the idea was to consider the R-universal unfolding F of
fo
f(x, 0) and Z(F), the zero-set of its gradient with respect to the space-variable
x. Then bifurcation problems are represented as lifts on Z(F) of one dimensional
paths through the parameter space of F. Thus the last step consists of defining an
equivalence relation for paths that respects the contact equivalence of the gradient

3. SINGULARITY THEORY
35
bifurcation problems. This approach has the great advantage of nicely organizing
the results. There is a hierarchy of potentials - independent of the number of distin-
guished parameters - and for each potential, a hierarchy of paths. But this too has
drawbacks: it still does not solve the problem of the appearance of unwanted moduli
in the classification of the potentials (fo) and of greater importance: the calcula-
tions associated with path equivalence rapidly become very complicated. Moreover,
in the equivariant setting the difficulties appear at low codimension.
For these reasons we take a different (hybrid) approach. After reviewing (in
Section 3.1) the classical methods for contact equivalence for bifurcation diagrams
of GSS II [1988], we develop, in Section 3.2, a theory based on the "gradient" part
of the tangent spaces used in the classical approach.
Although there is not an
underlying group of change of coordinates, the principal results go through.
We are able to define and compute the (gradient) gf-universal unfolding. In
some sense it corresponds to the "gradient" part of the Kf-universal unfolding of Vxf
(Universality Theorem). In a second step we tackle some aspects of the recognition
problem in particular when r is a finite group.
When r is finite, it is possible to redefine the path formulation in terms of the
(gradient) gr-universal unfolding of the potential fo. Our idea is to consider paths
in that modified parameter space. The theory for such paths is developed in Sec-
tion 3.4, where we use ideas of Mond & Montaldi [1991J. In Mond & Montaldi the
algebraic base for a similar program to tackle multi-parameter (A E Rk ) K.x-contact
equivalence without gradient structure or symmetry is laid down. A consequence
of our adaptation of the path formulation is Theorem 3.3 which states that under
mild assumptions finite gradient codimension is equivalent to finite Kf-codimension.
Hence, in practical terms, we can use the Kf-recognition theory, simply imposing
that the normal forms should be gradients. We shall also be using the path for-
mulation for the nice organization it provides (d.
Chapter 4 on classification of
Zq-equivariant gradient bifurcation problems). Most of the proofs are to be found
in Section 3.5. Before proceeding to the general theory some notation and prelimi-
nary results are introduced.
3.1 Contact Equivalence and Gradient Maps
The classic equivalence relation for bifurcation problems in £f is equivariant
contact equivalence where
£I = {h(X,A) I h: (Rn+1,O) -+ Rn
and ,h(X,A) = h(rx, A) , 'V, E r}.
Germs that are also gradients form a subset of £I which we define by
= {Vxf(x,A) If E
}.

SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
Associated with the sets £r,A' £I and £&,A are the following basic facts.
(a) £r,A is a finitely generated ring with a unique maximal ideal m;,A' When clear
from the context we shall denote the maximal ideal simply by m. The potentials
we consider are elements of
(b) £I is a finitely generated module over £r Aand a vector space over R.
(c) £&,A c £I is a real vector subspace of £I 'and has a module structure only over
the ring Ch of functions in A.
In general, the ring of functions over some space of parameters a will be denoted
by 0"".
Consider the set of r-commuting matrices
= {T: (Rn+1,0) -+ Mn(R) I T(,X,Ah = ,T(x, A) , 'V, E I"}.
Note that

subset of

of the identity.
The contact group
is by definition the set of triples (T, X, A) where T E

Ai > 0. The contact group
acts in a natural way in (m£A)r by
(T,X,A)·f = T(X,A) f(X(X,A),A(A»).
(3.3)
By definition two elements f,g E (m£Al are said to be contact equivalent if they
belong to the same orbit of the action (3.3).
Contact equivalence is also an equi-
valence relation on £&A but for f E £&A' (T,X,A)·f is not necessarily in £&A for
arbitrary (T, X, A) E
Therefore
modification of the usual
is
necessary in order to describe the contact classes inside £&,A' Before proceeding to
address this central question we record additional algebraic details necessary for the
theory of contact equivalence.
Basic among the algebraic objects is the tangent space at h E (m£Al of its
x:I-orbit defined by
For computational convenience, a £r A-submodule RT(h) of T(h,x:D is often used
instead (GSS I/ll [1985/1988]).
£I /T(h, x:D is of finite dimension as a real
vector space we say that h is of finite
When in fact T(h, x:D is of
finite codimension then
(a) there exists a "simple" polynomial in the contact class; that is, the normal form
of h,
(b) the elements of the class are defined by a finite set of equalities and inequalities
involving only a fixed finite part of their Taylor series.

3. SINGULARITY THEORY
37
Perturbations of elements in £I are described using the concept of an unfolding.
Given ne (m£>.l, an unfolding H of h with k parameters is a germ ofa r-equivariant
map (Rn+1+k,0)
Rn such that H(x, >., 0) = h(x, >.). Let
£Ln(k) = {H: (Rn+I+k,O) ---- Rn I His r-equivariant, H(·,·,O) E £I }
and
be the subset of £I,un(k) where H is a gradient map. More generally,
the subscript
V' indicates that we consider the elements of the space which are
also gradients in x. The group
extends naturally to
by considering the
quadruple (T, X, A, 4» acting on £I un(k) where (T, X, A) is a k-parameter unfolding
of an element in
and 4> : (Rk , 0)
(Rk , 0) is a diffeomorphism. The action of
(T,X,A,4»
on £I,un(k) is simply
(T,X,A,4»·H = T(x,>.,a) H(X(x,>.,a),A(>.,a),4>(a)).
(3.4)
Contact equivalence actually induces two relations on unfoldings. In addition
to (3.4) we can also compare two unfolding with different numbers of parameters but
the same h E £I. In particular, let H E £I,un(k) and G E £I,un(l) be two unfoldings
of h E £I- We say that G maps into H ifthere is (T, X, A, 4»
E
unfolding
of the identity and III : (RI,O)
(Rk,O) such that G = (T,X,A, III o4»·H. The
important property here is versality. H is said to be a versal unfolding of h if any
other unfolding G of h maps into H.
In particular the versal unfoldings with the
minimal number of parameters, say r, are called universal. The universal unfoldings
of h are all equivalent in the sense that they belong to the same
un(r)-orbit.
The construction of an universal unfolding uses the (extended) tangent space
corresponding to
Te(h,KD = {Th + hxX + h>.A I T E
X E£r, A: (R,O) ---- R }.
(3.5)
We use that space essentially to form the quotient £I/Te(h,KD
Ne(h,KD; that
is, the extended normal space. More generally, we will define normal spaces for all
the tangent spaces we consider. If both the ambient space and the tangent space
are clear from the context, we shall denote the associated normal space simply by
exchanging T for N.
Fundamental results on the normal space Ne(h, KD (GSS II [1988, p.212J) are:

Let I' be any compact Lie group we can suppose to act orthogonally on Rn and
let '\lxl be a gradient bifurcation problem in £I. The construction of the gradient
extended tangent space of '\lxl is as follows. Define
As we have previously mentioned, TV,e has only a structure of O.x-module but note
that, unlike Te, it has no a-priori nice
.x-submodule like Te.

Note that Nv,; is a subspace of Ne . The dimension of Nv,; as a real vector space is
the gradient codimension of '\lxI, denoted by codv('\lxl,KD.

Remark. Note that, for technical reasons, we deliberately took the non-equivariant
formulation for (b). As can be seen from the proof of Theorem 3.1 (p.49), we want
to prove that 9 E
is equivalent to the existence of a matrix T (which can be
made f-equivariant by averaging) such that '\lx9 = T '\lxf. At the present time, it
is not clear to us how to prove the result in all the cases if one takes the f-invariant
formulation
it is even not clear whether it is actually always true).
Technically the result we want is the following. Consider {Xi }i=l to be a set
of generators for £I. Form the matrix X such that Xij(X,'x) = (Xi}j(X,'x). Then

the fact that t(9, nD c t(f, nD means that there exist: a r-equivariant matrix
A (depending on (x, A)) such that
X 'lx9 = AX 'lxf.
To be able to get the conclusion we want that this last relation implies the existence
of a matrix T such that 'lx9 = T 'lxf.
Note that if the T-action is trivial then
X = In and the result is trivial.

Te(f,9f) and N e(f,9f) are in general only VA-modules, al-

The proof is to be found in Section 3.5. The theorem takes care of the unfol-
ding theory. We can now turn our attention to the recognition problem. It is not
immediately clear that we can also transpose the classical theory in the same gene-
rality that was obtained above for the unfolding theory. In the classical theory it is
possible, using unipotent subgroups of
to get - in a systematic way - powerful
estimates of the set of higher order terms (terms which can be removed in the Taylor
expansion of any element in a
class). In the case that 'lxf is of finite

40
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
(non-gradient situation) we know that the following Ch-module of
higher order terms is also of finite codimension (that is calculable)
(cf. Chapter XIV, GSS II [1988, p.204 ... ] or this work p.47).
We can thus define the following O,,-module
which we call the set of gradient higher-order terms. When r is not finite, the
codimension of "Vxf is not in general finite even if the gradient codimension is (cf.
the examples in Montaldi, Roberts & Stewart [1991]). But when r is finite we can
use the set of gradient higher-order terms provided the following assumption holds.
We say that fa E £0 satisfies (HI) if

As a consequence of the path formulation (d. next section), we have
Theorem 3.3. Suppose that r is finite and that fa satisfies (Hi), then
cod("Vxf, K:D < 00
iff
codY'("Vxf, K:D < 00 .
Remark.
Although (HI) is sufficient, we conjecture that it is not a necessary
hypothesis for the conclusion of Theorem 3.3 to hold true (but still with a finite f).
In Section 3.3 we shall discuss some alternative sufficient conditions.
When r is finite, Theorem 3.3 justifies the following methodology for the clas-
sification of problems with fa E £0 satisfying (HI).
We can work in the context.
of
and, for the recognition problem, we simply need to insure that
the normal forms are gradients. The question of higher-order terms is treated in
the classical way using the set of gradient higher-order terms. And then, for the
universal unfolding problem, we compute NY',e, which can be done by adapting the
classical computations of N e .
3.3 Potentials and Paths
Suppose that codY'("Vxf, K:D < 00, it is then easy to see that codY'('\lxfo , K:r)
is also finite. There is a result analogous to the Universality Theorem for "Vxfo.

is a gradient universal unfolding of V'xfo.
Proof. Follows the same line as the proof of Theorem 3.2.
41
•
More generally, the theorems and definitions of Section 3.2 transfer to this
situation (without distinguished parameter) with the necessary adjustments.
The path formulation takes the following form.
We can consider V'xf as a
one-parameter unfolding of V'xfo. From Proposition 3.5, it maps into V'xF, that is
V'xf(x, >') = T(x, >.) V'xF(X(x, >'), 4>(>'))
where (T, X, I, 4»

identified with
This shows that V'xf is
to V'xF(·, 4». Similarly any gradient unfolding ofV'xf, say V'xG, is equivalent as an
unfolding to V'xF(·, lJI), where lJI is an unfolding of 4>. This is because V'xG is not
only an unfolding of V'xfo but also of V'xf. Hence when V'xG maps into V'xF it can
be made to respect V'xf.
The problem is now to study the possible potentials and their universal gradient
unfoldings and to define an equivalence relation on the space of paths and the
unfoldings that respect the
of the gradients.
This last analysis is
carried out in Section 3.4 for finite groups. In the proof of the results concerning
the path formulation we shall need the hypothesis (HI). For the remainder of this
section we are going to concentrate on the potentials fo.
The a priori classification of the potentials i; and their gr-universal unfoldings
requires Kr-theory for the gradients. However, it is useful to first consider directly
Ar-equivalence for the potentials.
This has several advantages.
First, at "low"
codimension, it results in the same classification as gr (in the equivariant setting we
know that Rr-equivalence results in too fine a classification). A second advantage
is that for the common classes of the Ar and 9r-classifications, we can directly
compare any germs and unfoldings of those classes by changes of coordinates in the
potential setting and so reduce calculation.
The action of the group Ar on Er is given by
go = H
0 fo 0 X ,
where X E R r and H : (R, 0) ---+ (R, 0) is a diffeomorphism. The associated tangent
spaces necessary for the classification are:
Te(/o,Ar) = r; (/0 ,Rr ) + { a(/o) I a: (R,O) ---+ R },
T(Jo,U(Ar )) = T(Jo,U(Rr )) + { a(/o) I a: (R,O) ---+ (R,O) I

42
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
Note that the above tangent spaces are not £r-modules and so are not con-
venient to work with. In practical terms, we quotient first by the Rr-part of the
tangent space, and then use the second part to quotient again the result.
The next lemma indicates some alternative conditions to (HI).
Lemma 3.6. Suppose r

potential. The following are equivalent and imply (Hi)

cod(h, K) < 00.
Proof. It follows from Roberts [1986] that (a) is true and (a) ¢:} (b). It is clear
that (b) =} (c). For the reverse implication, passing to holomorphic germs, from
Proposition 2.4(ii) of Wall [1981], cod(V'xh, K) < 00 if and only if cod(V'xh,C) < 00 ,
where C denotes the action on the left by invertible matrices depending on the source
x. Now denote by .J(h) the jacobian ideal of h. Thus

Moreover, if fo is of (any) finite codimension (Hi) is satisfied.
Proof. (a) We assume that codv(Jo,Ar) < 00 (otherwise the result is obvious).
Let {V'Xh;}:=l be a base of Ne(Jo, Ar). Via V', {V'xhi}:=l generates NV,e(V'x!o, Kr)
but it might not be independent. Hence the conclusion.
(b) Via the proof of Proposition 1.3 of Roberts [1986], it is enough to prove
the result in the complexified situation. From Proposition 6 of Yau [1983], if [«.«: is
weighted homogeneous fo,c E m .J(Jo,c) and a(Jo,c) em .J(Jo,c), where .J(Jo,c)
denotes the Jacobian ideal of fo,c. Hence, by averaging over r, we get the equality
of tangent spaces we are aiming for.
When the codimension of any of those tangent spaces is finite, so is cod(Jo,c),
that is cod(V'xfo,c, K), hence codv(V'xfo' K) < 00, that is (HI).

We finish this section with a result that is needed for the discussion of the
higher order terms for paths. We can choose a base
of
Kr)
formed of homogeneous polynomials, which we order by increasing powers of x. For
that base, consider the following Ef-submodule of M r x Sr:
B = { (T,X) IT E (mM)r,
X E (m 2M)r such that
T'Y",/o - ('Y",/o)", X == 0
and
T 'Y",hk - ('Y",hk)xX E

For any given (To, X o) E B, we can form an lxl-matrix M(To,Xol that is constructed
as follows. For 1
k
t, decompose Tov», - ('Y",h k)", x, modulo TV',e('Y",/o,Kr)
in the base
to get the vectors {vdi=l' Then form the matrix M(To,Xol
whose k-th column is Vk. By construction those matrices are upper triangular (with
zero diagonal), hence nilpotent. This fact will be used in the proof of Lemma 3.16.
Remark (Linearized Stability). It is well-known that the (linearized) stability
of a gradient bifurcation equation changes iff there is a secondary bifurcation (0
eigenvalue) because the Jacobian of the equation is given by the Hessian of the
potential (symmetric matrix).
This means that contact equivalence is perfectly
adapted to deal with that situation as it preserves the sign of the determinant of
the Hessian and can therefore keep track of zero eigenvalues (in the general non-
gradient situation the problem is more difficult because Hopf bifurcation points are
not in general invariant under coordinate changes).
3.4 Equivalence for paths
Assume r is a finite group.
Consider /0 E Er satisfying (HI) and F(x,o) a
given gr_universal unfolding of /0 - without loss of generality we can take /0 and F
to be polynomials. And so, for a base
of NV',e('Y:z;/o, Kr) we may assume
that
I
F(x,o) = /o(x) +:L 0i h;(x).

(3.8)
Let PI = { 4> : (R, 0) ----> (RI , 0) } be the space of one-parameter paths through
the l-dimensional unfolding space. We consider the bifurcation problem given by
'Y:z;F(x,4>(,X)) with 4> E PI. We can also define unfoldings; in particular, let
be the space of q-dimensional unfoldings. The objective here is to define coordinate
changes on PI and PI,tm(q) and furthermore to relate the coordinate changes on PI
to the coordinate changes for
of the associated gradients.

A bifurcation diagram represented by a path <jJ is the slice of
Z(F) = {(x, a) I \lxF(x, a) = O}
above <jJ(..\); that is, those (x,O') where a = <jJ(..\) for some A, It is important to
monitor the position of <jJ E R1 where bifurcation occurs in Z(F). The natural way
to proceed is to compare the position of the image of <jJ with the local bifurcation
set
B = { a I :Jx : \lxF(x, a) = 0, IHessxFI = 0 }.
For technical reasons we are going to work on spaces of analytic functions
(real or complex).
The reason for this will become clear as we proceed.
As we
are interested in finitely determined problems the analyticity is not a restriction,
since the determinacy and unfolding results then transfer from the analytic to the
smooth case. We denote either R or C by K. For some results (like some geometric
criteria) we will need the complexification of some real analytic map I, and this
will be denoted by [c.
We retain the same notation for the function spaces and
groups of diffeomorphisms defined heretofore. Therefore let F be defined on K n+1.
F is also f-invariant with respect to the trivially extended action of I' on Kn+l. In
general Z(F) will not be a manifold, and so we introduce F which is the Q-universal
unfolding (without symmetry) of 10. For {\lxhl+;}f=l forming a base for the non-
invariant part of the complement of Tv,e(\lxlo, K), it is easy to see that F can be
chosen as
k
F(x, a, 13) = F(x, a) + Lj3i h1+i(X).
i=l
In a compact form, we denote (0',13) by u E K L , L = 1+ k. As 10 is assumed to be
in m 3 (cf. (3.1)), it is immediate that Z(F) is an analytic manifold of dimension L.
Lemma 3.8. There exists a f-aetion n on K L such that, combined with the f-
action f n we already have on K", it defines a f-diagonal action fn+L on Kn+L by
rn+L(X,U) = (rnX,rLU) making \lxF (fn,fn+L)-equivariant, that is
Proof. The f-action on Kn induces the following f-action f* on E:
Next, in the spirit of Slodowy [1978], we are going to introduce a f-action fL on K L
which, combined with that action f* on £, will make \lxF f-invariant.
Because \lxlo is fn-equivariant, Te(\lxlo,K) is globally f*-invariant. Moreover,
£v is also globally left invariant by F,; Hence f* induces a well-defined action I],

on the finite dimensional subspace Ne(\lxfo,K) (identified with KL). It is well-
known (Vanderbauwhede [1982]) that we can choose the identification as to make
fL orthogonal. And so
This defines an orthogonal f­action on K n+L by considering
in+L(X,U) = (rnX,iLU),
ViEf.
Clearly Z(F) is globally invariant under f n+ L . It follows from the proofs of Propo-
sition 2.4 and Corollary 4.5 in Slodowy [1978] that FIKnxFixrL = F.
•
Now consider the "catastrophe map" ir : Z(F) -+ KL induced from the natural
projection 1rL : Kn+L -+ KL. In the complex case, the theory of good representatives
(Looijenga [1984, p.25,...]) can be used to obtain the following results:
(a) (1rL, ire) satisfy the properties of (2.7) (Looijenga, p.25), that is ire defines an
isolated singularity at O. ire is a proper, finite analytic map.
(b) Let Gir be the critical set of ire (that is the set of points where ire is not a
submersion), then Gir is an analytic subset of Z(Fe) of dimension L ­ 1.
(c) The discriminant Lie = irc(G ir ) is an hypersurface of CL .
(d) ire defines an isolated complete intersection of dimension 0 at every point of
Z(Fe).
Moreover it is easy to check that ire is (fn+L' fd­equivariant and so that Gir
and Lie are respectively fn+L, fL­invariant. We define Lle = Lie n Fixn.. In the
real case we define Gir , Li, Ll as the real parts of their complex counterparts, in
which case we expect Bell strictly, but the analytic objects we are going to define
are the same in both (real and complex) cases.
It is now clear that the problem is to monitor the respective positions of Ll and
the image of ¢>. For this, consider the following group
of changes of coordinates
on Pt=
¢>(,\) = H('\, 1j>(A('\))),
¢>,1j> E PI , where
(a) A: (K,O) -+ (K,O) ,
> 0,
(b) H: (KI+1, 0) -+ KI is the restriction on Fix fL of it : (KI+L, 0) -+ KL such that
(Id, it) is a local diffeomorphism at (KI+L, 0) and it" (0, 0) is in the connected
component of the identity.
(c) Moreover, we ask that H is Ll preserving, that is
it('\,U) ELi, V'\, Vu ELi.
For any analytic variety V C K1, a group ­ denoted Kv, of changes of coordi-
nates on PI - has been introduced in Damon [1987]. In principle Kv is not required
to preserve the origin. Nevertheless, K\f can be regarded as a subgroup of a contact

46
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
group (Damon [1989]) having the additional property of preserving V in the image.
For K it is well known that, without loss of generality, H can be taken as a matrix
parametrized by the source. This is not possible for K v however; in particular, it is
essential to work with the full parametrized nonlinear changes of coordinates. On
the other hand, Damon [1987] has shown that Kv is a geometric subgroup of K and
that the singularity theory for Kv acting on PI follows the usual pattern.
In our situation

use the group K/),., defined in the previous paragraph, which is the restriction on Fix
n
of K2, the group containing all (H,A) E K;i such that H(·,>.) is n-equivariant.
We develop the explicit results we need in Section 3.5 where the proofs are given.
In particular, our choice of

We are now in a position to state the fundamental result which gives conditions
under which the local singularity theories for </>, using K/),.-equivalence, and \lxF(·, </»

Let us introduce the following linear map: let
</> E PI, then wtj> : PI -+
is
defined by
wtj>(O = ; Ir=o\lxF(x,</>(>.) + r{(>.)).
In other words, using the definition of F in (3.8), wtj>(O = 2::=1 {i(>') \lxhi(X). We
denote by 1m wtj> the image of wq,. We can now state
Lemma 3.9 (Fundamental Lemma). If codv(\lxF(·,</»,KD < 00, then
(a)
wtj> induces the following isomorphism of O,x-modules:
(b)
Wtj> is an isomorphism between T(\lxF(.,</»,U(KD) nlm Wtj> and T(</>,U(K/),.)).
(c)
Wtj> is an isomorphism between T(\lxF(-, </», Kl) n 1m wtj> and T( </>, K/),.). It also
induces the following injective homomorphism of O,x-modules:
The proof is given in Section 3.5. Note that we have to choose the following unipo-
tent subgroups of
(respectively K/),.), for part (b) to hold true. Classically U(KD
consists of changes of coordinates whose linear parts are the identity. To get Wtj> to
be an isomorphism, we need to choose for U(K/),.) the subgroup of K/),. whose linear
parts are unipotent diffeomorphisms represented by upper triangular matrices. We
can now state the basic result of this section.

for all unfoldings W of 4>.
Let us now describe how these results are to be used. Different scenarios are
possible. In some cases - for example, the simple singularities (Arnold [1972])
it is
possible to work directly in the path setting. However, it is necessary to compute the
generators for the tangent spaces associated with K:a. In general, this is a lengthy
computation, although feasible (in particular with the help of computer algebra).
Alternatively the computations can be carried out in the gradient (that is K:D setting
where they are easier (at least in the first approximation). This seems true for our
situation where the discriminants are complicated high-order polynomials. This is
the approach we use to classify the Zq-equivariant gradient bifurcation problems in
Chapter 4. We now describe in more detail the strategy we use (as a prototype for
other classifications).
Step 1. Discussion of the potentials in
(a) Classify under Ar-equivalence the potentials up to some codimension k.
k can be determined by the codimensions of the problems of interest.
For paths
4> E
associated with a potential F with I parameters, note that cod(4>, K:a)
cod( 4>, K:)
pI-I. The classification gives us the normal forms F of the Ar-universal
unfoldings we are interested in.
(b) If necessary, adjust the classification to the gr-equivalence.
Step 2. Classification of paths.
(a) Low order terms.
First we use a low order K:I-change of coordinates to bring 'Vxf(x, A) into
'VxF(',4»
plus higher order terms in (x,A).
In the first approximation it is not
important whether the higher order terms are gradient or not. In particular this
avoids the problem of having several connected components in the intersection of
and the K:I-orbit of'VxF(·,4». Such a
of coordinates brings all the
connected components into the one containing 'VxF(·, 4».
(b) Higher order terms.
There are two kinds of higher order terms: those corresponding to the gradient
theory, that is (4)+ h.o.t ,..., 4>; K:a) in PI, and those coming from the
of
coordinates.
Actually, as we use the
to estimate the higher order
terms for the paths, both computations are done at the same time.

48
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
Let us describe the theory in the path setting. It follows the same line for KI
and it can be found in GSS II [1988, Chapter XIV]. The set of higher order terms
for ¢ is defined as:
We refer to GSS II [1988, p.204] for more discussions on P('Vx! ,Kl).
Roughly
speaking, it represents the terms that can be cut-off for any member of the equiva-
lence class of </>. Another basic idea is the concept of an intrinsic part of a subspace
of PI. Suppose Q C PI is a subspace, then Intr{ Q} c Q is the largest subspace of
Q invariant with respect to
The basic theorem along these lines is
the following. Let us note that the same result holds for KI'
Theorem 3.11 (following Bruce, du Plessis & Wall [1987]).
Let ¢ be of
finite
then
From this result we can use W4> and the second part of the Fundamental Lemma to get
estimates on T(
using the classical computations of T('VxF(., ¢ ),U(Kl)).
At the same time, we shall also get estimates to remove the nongradient higher
order terms remaining after part (a). As usual, there is an interaction between the
two procedures. We have to keep computing explicit changes of coordinates until
we can apply the theory of part (b) to discard the higher order terms.
Step 3. Universal unfolding.
The last step is to obtain an unfolding iI> of </> such that 'VxF(·,iI»
is a versal
unfolding of 'VxF(·,</»
in the sense of part (c) of the Fundamental Theorem.
A
base {</>i}f=l of N e ( </>,

'lxg = T'lxf. Averaging T over r, we find that 'lxg = T'lxf for T E

A useful ingredient for the proof of the Universality Theorem is the following
lemma.
Lemma 3.12.
Under the assumptions of the Universality Theorem, consider any
91-unfolding 'VxH(x,>..,8) of'Vxf with parameter space 8 E RP. Then the normal
space N'V,e,un ('VxH, KI,un(p)) is a finitely generated O>.,o-module.
Proof. Via the isomorphism
T'V,e,un('VxH,KI,un(p)) is the image of

Therefore, the statement is verified if the following O'\,o-module,
is finitely generated. However, W is trivially a finite
.....(p)-module and
, ,

is of finite dimension because 10 is of finite gradient codimension (without parame-
ters) if 1 is (with parameters). Therefore, using Lemma 7.1 of GSS II [1988, p.234]
it follows that W is a finitely generated O'\,o-module.
•
Proof of the Universality Theorem.
(a) This is the important part of the
proposition. We use the classical proof that infinitesimal stability implies stability.
As it is classical and long, it is not necessary to reproduce it here. A complete expo-
sition can be found in GSS II [1988, p.238-241]. We can check that the same proof
goes through if we can show the relation (7.13) in GSS II [1988, p.239]. Explicitly,
let \lxH(x, >., h) be any QI-versal unfolding of \lxf with p parameters, h E RP. The
relation (7.13) in GSS II takes the form

W =

Obviously (3.9) follows if W is generated by
H=l as an Oo-module.
From
Lemma 3.12, W is a finitely generated O,\,o-module. The proof now follows from
the Equivariant Preparation Theorem as in Lemma 7.1 and Corollary 7.2 of GSS II
[1988, p.234-36]. Because W o = NV,e(''Vxf, KD is a finite dimensional vector space
generated by
(x, >., O)}f=ll and so W is finitely generated by
H=l as an
Oo-module
(b,c) The proofs of these two remaining parts of the Universality Theorem
follow exactly the classical pattern. We refer to Theorem 7.4 in GSS II [1988, p.241]
and its proof.

If codv(\lx/, KI) < 00 and 10 satisfy (HI), \lxf is represented by a potential F

52

part (a), it means that cod( 1>, KA) < 00. And so, from part (a) of the Fundamental
Theorem cod(\lxF(',1»,KD < 00 which implies that cod(\lxf,KD < 00.
•
Before embarking on the remaining proofs, we turn now our attention to the
KA-theory. The group KA has been defined in the last section (see Section 3.4) and
its action on PI is
(H,A)·1>=H(1>oA,·) .
Associated with the space PI and the group KA one has PI,un(p), the space of
p-parameter unfoldings, and KA,un(p), the group of isomorphisms of p-parameter
unfoldings acting on PI.
In addition, the notion of mapping between unfoldings
with different numbers of parameters, hence of (uni)versality, also extends in the
classical way.
Let us define the following :
£0:,0: = {{: (KI,O) -+ KI } and e.: = {{: (KL,O) -+ KL } ,
= { g E Ou I
== 0 } ,
= { g E
I g is rL-invariant} ,

such that g = glFixrL } ,

eA = { { E £0:,0: I :3
E e t such that

N(eA) = {

Unlike the smooth real case, e A andet are finitely generated 00: (resp.
modules of (equivariant) vector fields tangent to
(resp.
The set of generators
of e A is denoted by {J.l j
For 1> E PI, the 0>.-module generated by {J.li 0 1>}
is denoted by 1>*eA'
The tangent spaces needed are the following O>.-submodules of PI :
T(1),KA) = rn>. <1>>.> + 1>*(eA)
T(1),U(KA)) = rnl <1>>.> + 1>*(N(eA))
Te(1),KA) = <1>>.> + 1>*(eA).
The 4 conditions for KA to be a geometric subgroup of K (in the sense of Damon
[1984]) are satisfied. The main result for KA-theory is then
Lemma 3.13.
Consider 1> E PI and
E Pl,un(p), a p-parameter unfolding of 1>.

In the holomorphic case there is an alternative description of finite codimension
in "geometrical" terms. We follow the line of Damon & Mond [1990]. Let us first
define algebraic transversality.
We say that 4>e E PI is algebraic-transverse at AO
to <le if 4>e is transverse at 4>c(AO) to the vector subspace of CI generated by
{Jlj 0 4>e
We say that 4>c is transverse to <le if it is transverse at every
point of a punctured neighborhood of the origin.
Remark that if 4>e(Ao) fj. <le,
transversality is always satisfied. And so we get
Proposition 3.14.
cod(4)e,Ka) < 00 iff 4>e is transverse to <le.
Proof. Let M(A) be the matrix formed by the vectors (4)e),,, Jlj(4)e), 1::; j ::; M.
We claim that cod(4>e, Ka) < 00 iff Mhas rank I in a punctured neighborhood of
the origin, that is iff 4>e is transverse to <le.
Denote by
the standard base of CI . Then, cod(4>e, Ka ) < 00 iff there is
an integer k such that Akej C T(4)e,Ka) for 1 ::; j ::; I, iff there are aj E (O,,)I+M
such that Maj(A) = Akej for 1::; j ::; I, iff M has rank I for A =f O.
•
We can now turn our attention to the proof of the Fundamental Lemma. First
we need two preliminary results.
Lemma 3.15 (Liftable Vector Fields).
(a) t E
iff there is a rn+L-equivariant vector field ji on Z(F) such that
dif(ji(x,u)) = t(1f(x,u)) , V(x,u) E Z(F).
(b)
Moreover, in the context of part (aJ to = O. By local integration this means
that Ka C K.
Proof. (a) As 1fdefines - at the origin - an isolated complete intersection singularity
of dimension 0, from Theorem A in Terao [1983], we know that, without symmetry,
[ E E>A iff there is a vector field [l on Z(F) such that for all (x, u) E Z(F)
d1f([l(x,u)) = [(1f(x,u)).
We can now obtain the result through averaging. As r is a finite group, the formula
gives the required rn+L-equivariant vector field tangent to Z(F).
(b) By writing d1f(ji(x,u)) = t(1f(x,u)) in coordinates and putting u = 0, we
find that

4. Classification of
Zq-Equivariant Gradient Bifurcation Problems
Suppose Vxf(x, A, a) is a Zq-equivariant gradient bifurcation problem with f a
smooth potential (germ), x E R2 , A E R (the main bifurcation parameter), a E Rm
(the unfolding parameters). We assume that q
3.
To classify Zq-equivariant gradient bifurcation problems we follow the program
detailed in Chapter 3. First, the singularities of the potential without distinguished
parameter are classified up to codimension 3 using AZq-equivalence. Then, using the
path formulation and the Fundamental Theorem, the singularities of Zq-equivariant
gradient mapson R2 with a distinguished parameter are classified up to topological
codimension 2.
It is convenient to identify R2 with C through z = Xl + iX2' Then Zq = < 8q >
with 8q •z = ei8 z with () = 21rplq and any nonstandard action of Zq can be recovered
by a group homomorphism.
We begin by recording some basic results that are either well known or routine
to verify.
(a) The ring of real Zq-invariant functions,
is generated by
(4.1)
We denote by
(C) = { p+iq Ip, q E
} the ring of complex valued Zq-invariant
functions.
When q = 4 there is a more convenient (but equivalent) basis for the invariants.
Let
8 = -t (z2 + z2) , jl = t i (z2 - z2) , 6. = 82 and w = 28jl.
Then (u, 6., 28jl) is used instead of (u, v, w). This choice of coordinates is an exten-
sion of the invariants used in Golubitsky & Roberts [1987] for 0 4 .
(b) The addition of the reflection z f-+ Z to Zq results in the standard representation
of Oq on C.
The ring of Oq-invariant functions,
is generated by u and v
(respectively u and 6. when q = 4).
(c) From the relation w2+ v2 = u q (respectively w2 = 46.(u2 - 6.) when q = 4),
the ring
has the structure of a
freely generated by 1 and w. And
so any Zq-invariant potential can be uniquely written as
H(z) = {F(u,v)+wG(u,v),
F(u,6.) + 28jlG(u,6.),
q=4.

(d) The Zq-equivariant gradient map associated with (4.2) is

\lzH(z) =
[2Fu - 4i(uG +
+
z
q=4.
(e) The
of equivariant maps from R2 -+ R2 , denoted by EZq, is freely
generated over E?q. The generators are z, iz, zq-l and
and if q = 4,
is
replaced by st. Hence we can represent an element h of EZq by
h(Z)=!(U,V)Z+g(U,V)zq-l
with
!,gEE?q(C).
(f) Let h = ! z + 9
(respectively! z + 9 DZ if q = 4). Then h is a gradient iff
or,ifq=4,
Re (2h + gu) = 1m(f + u!u +
- ug -

== 0.
(g) The above results in (a)-(f) are unmodified by the introduction of (bifurcation
and unfolding) parameters.
When the bifurcation parameter>. is present, a >.-
subscript is added to the symbol of the space under consideration; for example,
= { H(z, >') I H: C x R -+ Rand
His Zq-invariant }.
4.1 AZq-classification of potentials
We classify Zq-invariant potentials on R2 via AZq-equivalence.
The group of
changes of coordinates corresponding to AZq on
is given by
{(a,Z) I a: (R,O) -+ R, a
O =I- 0, Z = bz +
with b,c E E?q(C), b
O =I- O},
with the action (a, Z) . H = a(H(Z)) for H
E (mEo)Zq.
Note that a" can be
any non-zero real number because -I belongs to the connected component of the
identity in the space of Zq-commuting matrices.
Through (4.2), (mEolq is identified with ((mEo)Oq)2. And so, a given potential
H can be identified with the pair of functions (F, G) in (mEo)Oq. The generators
t 1 •.. t4 for the different tangent spaces that we will use are given by

explicit changes of coordinates. For a change of coordinates Z(z) = b(z) z+c(z)zq-1,
b,c E £?q(C), the invariants (u,v,w) in the transformed coordinates for q = 3,4

follows.
Lemma 4.1.
Let H = F + w G be a potential in (m£o)Zq.

without bifurcation.
(b) If

such. that (H,...., v + F(u); AZq).
Furthermore, the universal unfolding of an
H of finite codimensioti is aIM of the form v+Fe(u,v) where Fe(u,O) = F(u).
Moreover, when q = 3, F = Fe == o.

resulting in (H

To prove part (b), we assume that the first part of (b) is true; it is then a simple
computation to show that
To verify the first part of statement (b), consider an explicit change of coordinates
Z = b(z) z with bEE,?' (C). We can then write b(z) = bo+ U bI(u) +v b2(u, v) with
bo i- o. Now consider a similar splitting for H,
where F: E R, H I,H2 and GI E mOs • The idea is to remove H 2 and GI using bI
and bz and to take care of (F:, GO) with bo.
After some calculation, the problem can be reduced to the solvability of the
following equations in C
R2 :
bgao = 1,
blaobg-I + L(u,bo,bI) = 0,
b2aobg-I + M( u, v, b»,bI , b2 ) = 0,

(4.4)
Clearly bg = its; and the solvability of (4.3) and (4.4) is established using the
Implicit Function Theorem.
In the cases when q i- 3, we have no a priori control over the transformation of
the u part of H, giving rise to some F(u). Using t1 and t2 , it is a simple verification
to show that
Z
<v,w> c'T.(v+F(u),A '),
and so the universal unfolding of v + F(u) can be chosen to depend only on u and
some parameters a. This completes the proof.

4.1 then, with an elementary change of coordinates, H can be transformed into a

4.2 Classification of Zq-equivariant bifurcation problems
69
Now we consider the subsequent parts of the classification of Zq-equivariant
gradient maps. Here we consider paths through the unfolding of the Zq-potentials
and then use path equivalence. Ultimately the result is a classification up to contact
equivalence of gradient maps preserving the special role of the bifurcation parameter.
Given a Zq-invariant potential h(z, ..\), set ..\ = 0 and consider the AZq-universal
unfolding H(z, 1/), 1/ E Rk , of
Let 4>: R ---+ Rk be a path, then V'zh(z,..\) can be represented by v.ni«, 4>(..\))

of coordinates.
With the exception of the potential j «u 2 + 21qv 2 all Zq-invariant potential germs
up to topological codimension 3 and their universal enfoldings are identical to Oq-
invariant potentials with their universal unfoldings (see the discussion in previous
section).
Therefore we can apply Oq-theory to Zq-invariant potentials in an equiva-
lence class with a Oq-invariant potential. Classifications of the corresponding Oq-
equivariant bifurcation diagrams up to topological codimension 2 can be found in
Furter [1990], Golubitsky & Roberts [1987J and Furter [1991J for 0 3 , 0 4 and Oq,
q
5, respectively.
For these cases the Zq-classification will follow the Oq-results
with minor adaptation; in particular, the values of the coefficients in the normal
forms will depend on the G-part of the potential H = F + w G.
For 0 4 it is necessary to modify the normal forms of Golubitsky & Roberts to
adapt the coefficients to the gradient setting (see Chapter 6).
The fundamental result is stated in Theorem 4.2 for which we introduce the fol-
lowing quantities (when defined). Let H(z, 4>(..\)) = F(u, v, 4>(..\)) + w G(u ,v, 4>(..\))

Theorem 4.2.
Up to topological codimension 2, the classification of Zq-equivariant
gradient bifurcation problems is as follows:
(a) if the associated potential satisfies F:2 + Go2 i- 0 then the normal forms and
universal unfoldings are equivalent to the results for Dq-equivariant gradient
bifurcation problems (up to topological codimension 2),
(b) when q i- 4 and
+ Go2 = 0 but F':' . FtS. . ( i- 0 then the normal form is
(u + A) Z + (v + kA)
(4.8)
where e = sign (F'::'F.:i) and k E C· is a modal parameter as defined in (4.7a).
The universal unfolding of (4.8) is
(U+ A) Z+(V+kA+O')zq-l
(4.9)
where 0' E C is the unfolding parameter. The normal form (4.8) is of codimen-
sion 4 but of topological codimension 2.
(c) When q = 4 and
+ Go2 = 0 but F':' . F.:i . ( i- 0 then the normal form is
where e = sign (F'::'F.:i) and k E C· is a modal parameter as defined in (4.7b).
The universal unfolding is
where 0' E C is the unfolding parameter.
The normal forms that are also Dq-equivariant do not need as many sign cons-
tants when considered as Zq-equivariant problems; this is because -I belongs to the
connected component of the identity in the set of Zq-commuting matrices.
Proof. Because the group lCli., of equivalence for paths, is a subgroup of the usual
group of contact equivalence for functions ¢ : R --+ Rk and because ¢(O) = 0, the
topological lCIi. -codimension of ¢ is at least k -1. As we are interested in bifurcation
diagrams of topological codimension at most 2, this implies we should only consider
potentials of topological AZq-codimension at most 3. In other words, the only cases
which are not analyzable through the Dq-theory are given by paths through the
potential

first (I,Z,A)· (f,g) = (f',g') and then (T,I,I)· (f',g') = (f",g") producing the
final result. We find that

Note that fl can actually be eliminated by incorporating the sign of F::" in f.
There is also a small discrepancy between the definition of m for Z4-equivariant and
D4-equivariant problems, that is, when G == 0 and F.s.. > 0 we do not recover exactly
the formula of Chapter 6. On a more general level, this is the price to pay to be
able to impose some coefficients to be 1 in the Zq-theory instead of being equal to
the sign of some quantities.
In Chapter 8, for the study of the collision of multipliers we shall need the
following additional normal forms of topological codimension 1.
Corollary 4.4.
Let H(z, A) = F(u, v, A)+ w G(u , v, A) be a Zq-invariant potential.
Suppose that .Fvo2 + Go2 =I- 0 but F';>' = O.
Then the diagrams of topological codi-
mensioti 1, V'zH(z, A), are
to the following normal forms {a is the
unfolding parameter):
(a) when q = 3 and e =I- 0
(fA2+ a ) z + :z2 ,

4.3 Bifurcation diagrams for the unfolding (4.9)
Normal forms for Zq-equivariant gradient bifurcation problems fall into two
categories: those with .Fv02 + Go2 =I- 0 and those with .Fv02 + Go2 = O.
Bifurcation diagrams for the former category can be obtained from the analo-
gous Dq-normal forms by a suitable coordinate transformation.

4. Zq-EQUIVARIANT MAP GERMS
75
When F,,02 + c« = 0 the resulting normal form was given in equation (4.8)
with unfolding
(u + lOA) Z + (v + kA+ a):zq-l
(4.15)
where k, a E C. When k, a E R the normal form (4.15) reduces to the Dq-equivariant
case for which the bifurcation diagrams are well-known (d.
GSS II [1988, p.200])
and this will be our point of reference when analyzing the bifurcation diagrams for
(4.15).
With k, a E C, non-trivial differences (compared with k, a E R) arise in the
bifurcation diagrams; in particular, the secondary bifurcation points break-up into
limit points.
The analysis of (4.15) is simplified by using polar coordinates rather than carte-
sian coordinates for the complex variables z , k and a.
Technically the resulting
equations in polar coordinates do not satisfy the unfolding conditions (difficulties
with the mapping (ar,ai) >-t (lal,Arga) in the unfolding space) so we must verify
that the diagrams are preserved under the inverse mapping (lal,Arga) >-t (ar,a;).
Let
z = r ei 8, a = R
and k = k ei\ll. As k is a modal parameter, the
parameters k and W can be treated as any admissible fixed numbers. However, a is
the unfolding parameter which requires that lal = R be small and although <P can
be any angle, it represents the deviation from W= Arg a.
Given (k,w) the idea is to determine solutions of (4.15) with (R,<P) variable
and R small but fixed relative to z. Keeping in mind that (4.15) is an unfolding
germ, admissible solutions are those that persist in the limit R -+ O.
Equating the real and imaginary parts of (4.15) to zero results in the following
system for the non-trivial solutions of (4.15)
A(1 + 10k rq- 2 cos(w - qB))
+R r q- 2 cos(w + <P - qB) + r 2 + r 2q- 2 cos2 qB = 0,
kA sinew - qB) +R sinew + <P - qB) - r q cos qB sin qB = O.
(4.16)
(4.17)
It is clear that A can be eliminated - for r sufficiently small- using (4.16), resulting
in the single function of (r, B, R, <p):
0= H(r, 0, R, <p) = R sineW+ <P - qB)+ 10k R rq- 2 sin <P - 10k r 2 sinew - q8)
- !rq sin 2qB - 10k r2q- 2 cos qO sin W.
(4.18)
Given (r,O,R,<P) as a solution of (4.18), back substitution into (4.16) provides the
corresponding value of..\. Recall that k, a E R (<p = w = 0 mod 11') corresponds to
the Dq-normal form. In the polar coordinates it is W = 0,11' that recovers the real
modal parameter and <P = 0,11' that recovers the real unfolding parameter.

76
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
In the absence of the unfolding term - setting R = 0 - the Implicit Function
Theorem is easily applied to r- 2 H( r, B, 0,
to show that there exists 2q branches
B;(r), 1
i
2q, with Bf satisfying sin (w - qBn = 0 and furthermore
The initial direction of the bifurcating branches is determined by w, the argument
of the modal parameter. There are two special situations to consider.
When sin 2w = 0, returning to (4.18), we see that the bifurcating branches
lie in the planes sinqB = 0 or cosqB = O. The first case (w = 0,11") is the known
Dq-situation where k E R. The second (w =
is when a is purely imaginary.
In that case the diagram is a rotation of the Dq-diagram with the modal parameter
Ikl. In both cases, the stability on branch i is given by the sign of
8;. And so,
we can consider the role of W as to introduce a "twist" in the bifurcation diagram
relative to the special situation when sin 2w = O.
When R #- 0 the implicit function theorem can again be used to show that
there exist 2q branches B;(r), 1

with 8; = cos (w +
- 3Bn (8; = 1). The argument
of the unfolding parameter
introduces an additional "twist". Figures 4.1(a) and (b) show the (r,B) plane for
small twist when q = 3 and 4.
Unless we are in the situation where k is real or purely imaginary with a to
match, that is sin 2w = sin
= 0, it is also easily established that there is at most
one solution of (4.18) along any given ray { (r, B) I r small, B fixed} and exactly
one if
sin(w +
- qB) sin(w - qB) > 0 .
(4.19)
The important value of
is 11" where the two sinus functions of (4.19) change their
respective position. Hence the only remaining possible "secondary bifurcations" are
turning points given by H = He = O. In particular, when (4.19) is satisfied, in con-
trast to the real unfolding of the Dq-case, there are no symmetry breaking secondary
bifurcations: all the bifurcating branches in the Zq-case are non-symmetric.
The transition variety for the unfolding corresponds to the collapse of two of
the turning points and is given by
{
I :3 (r, B) with H(r, B, R, <P.) = He(r, B,
= H9J(r, B,
= 0 }. (4.20)

4. Zq-EQUIVARIANT MAP GERMS
77
A careful, but routine, analysis of this system shows that when (4.19) is satisfied,
the solution set of (4.20) is empty; there is no change in the behavior of the turning
points modulo periodicity.
The branches are in the cones defined by (4.19), with or without turning points.
As
c/J varies, these cones shrink or expand without changing the behavior of the
branch inside them (d. Figure 4.1).

Stability in the unfolding (4.8), as given by the sign of the Jacobian, results in
a complicated formula which is given in Appendix H. The best way to understand
it is to continue the stability assignments of the branches of the Oq-unfolding as the
"screws", that is
and W, are applied to it. Note that stability does not follow the
turning points of H.

5. Period-3 points of the generalized standard map
As an example to illustrate the theory of Chapters 3 and 4, we are going to
look at the bifurcation of period-3 points in the generalized standard map, denoted
by 8. This map is area-preserving and takes the form
x' = x +u(y',A),
y' = y - v(x, A),
where u , v : Rx Rk -+ R are smooth functions depending on the (multi)parameter A.
We assume that x = y = 0 is a fixed point of the map for some value A o • Without
loss of generality take Ao = 0; then, at such a fixed point,
Associated with the map (5.1) is the generating function
h(x,x',A) = U(x - x',A) - V(x,A),
(5.2)
where Ut(t,A) = -u-1(-t,A) and Vi(t,A) = v(t,A).
If U is an even function note that (5.1) is reversible on configuration space (d.
Appendix F) with reversor x,
We refer to the beginning of Chapter 7 for further
discussions of the reversibility of (5.1). An example of non x-reversible map is the
inverse of the Rannou map (Rannou [1974]) defined by:
u(t)=cost-t-1
and
v(t,A)=(A-3)(cost-sint-1).
(5.3)
Without limiting the generality, we can normalize the twist
to 1 by conside-
ring positive scalings and 8-1 instead of 8 (to change the sign of the twist). And
so, setting
the linearization of (5.1) about the trivial so!ution is
D8° =
If the origin is an elliptic fixed point, the multipliers lie at e±i9, 8 E R, and a satisfies
a = 2(1-cos8).
In this chapter we take 8 = 23
1r and compute normal forms for the bifurcation
equations for the period-3 points as a function of U and Vj that is, as a function of

86
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
(5.4)
the Taylor coefficients of U and V at the origin:
U(t,O) =
+ iBt3 + 1-Ct4+ kDt5 +
+
,
V(t,O) =
+ ibt3 + 1-et4 + tdt5 + iet6 +
.
In practice U and V may have only finitely many terms (cf. the quadratic map) but
based on the singularity theory of Chapter 3 we include all terms that may contribute
to finite determinacy. In the simplest cases (the generic theory for example) only
the first few Taylor coefficients contribute to the finite determinacy question, but
for the higher codimension singularities all 9 Taylor coefficients a, (b,B) ... (e, E)
contribute to the normal form.
5.1 Computations of the bifurcation equation
Without limiting the generality, as in Chapter 2, we can assume that Vxx(O, A)
depends on only one bifurcation parameter, A E R, and is of the form 3 - A. When
A = 0 the multipliers are at third roots of unity (cos B= - V and on the space
of period-S scalar sequences the action is

We can now apply the classification results of Chapter 4 to (5.8).
5.2 Analysis of the bifurcation equations
(5.8)
(5.9)
The basic result is the generic case; that is, if W2 + i W2 #- 0 (or equivalently if
b2 + B2 #- 0) then the gradient of (5.8) is equivalent to (see Corollary 4.3(a))
g(Z,A)=AZ+Z2
with
z=Xl+iX2,
which recovers the classic result on period-3 points in Meyer [1970].
From the Stability Lemma I 2.10, the stability is determined from

88
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
For Az + z2 a simple calculation shows that J = -sign u = -1, recovering the well-
known result that generic period 3 points are unstable (Meyer [1971]). In particular
the Rannou map in (5.3) satisfies the generic non-degeneracy condition.
Note that when b+ iB i- 0, the only further degeneracies that can occur for Z3-
equivariant problems are related to the number of A-derivatives of V:z:z;(O, A) vanishing
at A = 0; that is, they are of normal form AI Z + z2 for some 1:::: 2.
A new interesting feature appears when the coefficients W2 and W2 (or equiva-
lently b and B) go through 0: the period-3 points can stabilize through a turn in
the bifurcation branch.
Using Theorem 4.2(b), the first normal form for (5.8) in that direction is
(u + E,\) Z + (v + k.A) z2 .

The coefficients in the normal form can be expressed in terms of the coefficients in
the generating function; we find,
E=sign(C-c)
and
k=E[f(d+iD)'l/J-I
where 'l/J E C is defined by 'l/J2 = (C - c) (c2+is - e) - (d + i D?
The nondegeneracy condition is E·'l/J·(d+i D) i- O. Stability, given by the sign of
IHessxW31, is a rather complicated expression. The bifurcation diagrams that are
obtained have been studied in the last chapter (see Figures 4.1, 4.2).
We end this chapter with some remarks on the area of the polygon formed by
the bifurcating period-3 points. The area function takes a particularly simple form
in the coordinates x = xl6 + x26 + T
Given the ordered coordinates (xj,Yj)
of the group orbit of a family of period-3 points, A =
- XjYi+t}
gives the oriented area. In the generalized standard map Yj+l = u-I(Xj+l - xj,A),
therefore

Other
geometric properties such as the center of gravity of the polygon formed by the

geometry of period-q points is an interesting area (see Davis [1979] and Schoenberg
[1950]).

6. Classification of
Dq-Equivariant Gradient Bifurcation Problems
In this chapter the theory of Chapter 3 is used to give a classification of Oq-
equivariant gradient bifurcation problems on R2 • Oq­equivariant gradient bifurcation
problems arise, in the theory of bifurcating period­q points, when the symplectic map
is also reversible (for example see Theorem 2.9 in Chapter 2).
The details of the classification up to topological K?q­codimension two (that is
when there is no gradient structure) is given in Furter [1990,1991] for q :::: 3 (q i- 4).
Therefore we need only a sketch of the results, with emphasis on the restrictions
imposed by the gradient structure.
In Section 6.1 we record a list of the singularities and their unfoldings which
we use to study the bifurcation of period­q points in two­parameter families of
reversible­symplectic maps in Chapters 7 and 10.
A different basis is used for the set of invariants when q = 4 and therefore ­ in
Section 6.2 ­ we give a separate treatment of this case. The classification for 0 4 -
equivariant germs up to topological codimension 2 ­ without a gradient structure -
can be found in Golubitsky & Roberts [1987], and in Section 6.2 we introduce the
modifications required by the gradient structure.
6.1 Oq-normal forms when q i- 4
In Proposition 2.6 it was shown that every parametrized family H of Oq-
invariant potentials on R2 is a function of u, v, the Oq­invariants on R2 , and the
parameters A: H( u, v, A).
Here we record the details necessary to complete the
proof of Theorem 2.9 with one dimensional distinguished parameter 'x.
Let H(u,v,'x) be a Oq­invariant potential (q i- 4). If Hvo·H:i>. i- 0 (and H:!u i- 0
when q :::: 5), then VzH is K?q­contact equivalent to the gradient of
q = 3,
with
} = sign H:i>.,
2 = sign H:!u and 01 = sign H: .
These two potentials correspond to the generic situation (codimension 0) and
are therefore their own universal unfolding.
In Chapter 10 we consider the collision of multipliers at rational points in
reversible­symplectic maps. After application of the Splitting Lemma we reduce the
analysis of bifurcating period­q points to a Oq­equivariant gradient map on R2 with

90

the collision singularity. For the Oq-invariant potential H, the collision singularity
corresponds to the generic case satisfying H:/>. = O.
Suppose that H:/>. = 0 but that H: . H:/».. -I 0 (and H:'m -10 when q
5), then

A Dq-equivariant gradient map with collision singularity is of

H(u,v,.-\,O') = H(u,v,.-\) + "2O'u.
In Chapter 7 we also discuss the effect of various other singularities that arise
in the bifurcation of period-q points in two-parameter reversible maps. These singu-
larities can be found in the classification up to topological codimension 2 (cf. Furter
[1990,1991]).
6.2 D4-invariant potentials with a distinguished parameter path
In this section we use the path formulation of Section 3.3 to give a classification
of D4-equivariant gradient bifurcation problems.
Let z = x +iy then the 04-invariants on R2 are
N = z-Z and
= 62
where
8 = -Rez2 •
Given a D4-invariant potential dependent on a parameter X: H, the corresponding
gradient takes the form
g(z) = 2 HN z - 4 He. sr.
Note that a general D4-equivariant map has the form
z +
sz ,
(6.1)
where p and qare real D4-invariant functions, and the gradient structure forces the
following relation
2fie. + qN == 0 .
For the general class of D4-equivariant maps on R2 , Golubitsky & Roberts
obtain the classification up to topological codimension 2 using
They find 15 normal forms families (some with moduli).
Proposition 6.1.
For each of the 15 normal forms families (excluding the case
X) of topological codimension less than or equal to 2 in the Golubitsky & Roberts

6. Dq-EQUIVARIANT BIFURCATIONS
91
classification, the K?'-orbit of each normal form contains a gradient.
Moreover,
their gradient K?'-codimension is equal to the K?'-codimension.
For normal form X, the potential is of RP'-codimension /1 (including the mo-
dulus) with unfolding
f1mER\{O,1,!}. (6.2)
where mER is a modulus, f1,f2 = ±1 and (-'(,Il,';') E R3 are the unfolding parame-
ters. Moreover, there exists a two-parameter unfolding path
This result means that the classification for D4-equivariant gradient maps is
roughly identical to the K?'-classification. On a practical level, the only difference
is that in the case X the modulus n (in the K?'-classification) is forced by the
gradient structure to take the value -
fl. However, to be precise there are changes
that must be made to the normal forms (scalings and different unfoldings) to account
for the gradient structure.
Using the path formulation we list the potentials and paths corresponding to the
universal unfoldings up to topological codimension 2 (with parameters m (modal),
A, (Q,(3, I))'
The codimensions in the list refer to the Ao"-codimension of the
associated potentials (with parameters iii (modal), (V,Il,';')).
The case numbers
correspond to the K?'-classification of Golubitsky & Roberts (a * indicates that the
K?' normal form had to be altered to fit the gradient structure and a + indicates
that the normal form contains moduli parameters, that is, that the Coo-codimension
is strictly bigger).

More detailed results on the problems of topological codimension 1 and case
X are given in Table 6.1, with the defining conditions given in Table 6.2.
These
are the most important normal forms for studying bifurcation of period-4 points in
reversible-symplectic maps.
The normal form X is a two moduli (m, n)-family in the non-gradient setting.
The gradient structure fixes the second modulus:
With the reduction to one modulus in the normal form a complete classification of
the bifurcation diagrams is now much simpler to achieve. Differentiating (6.2) we

6. Dq-EQUIVARIANT BIFURCATIONS
93
get the normal form X whose branches of solutions, along with the eigenvalues of
the Hessian of H, are given by
{
R branch: -EOA = (0: - (3)x 2 + (m -
-
E2 x 6 ,
y = 0
Eigenvalues:
((3 + El x 2 + ... , (0: - (3) + (2m - 3Ed x 2 + ...)
{
S branch: -EOA = 20:x 2 +4m x 4 ,
x = y
Eigenvalues: (-(3 -
2El x 2 +... , 0:+4m x 2 )
{
T branch: -EOA = o:N +mN2 -
tEl.1.,
Eigenvalues: IHesszHI < 0
(always).
For the T-branch, note that the gradient structure forces the eigenvalues of the
Hessian (the Jacobian of the normal form) to be of opposite sign,
for (N, A, 0:,(3) sufficiently small. The T-branch corresponds to the secondary branch
of solutions with trivial isotropy subgroup (orbits without symmetry). These bran-
ches are always unstable in the normal form X for the gradient case.
The transition varieties in the unfolding space (0:, (3) for the normal form X are
given in Table 6.3 (using notation of Golubitsky & Roberts). Note that the transition
varieties are functions of erm, that is, the sign of El does not enter independently.
And so we fix ei = +1.
The respective positions of the transition varieties are important to describe
the diagrams of (6.2) and these positions are functions of m. There are 11 regions
in the m-space and the properties of the bifurcation diagrams in each region are
topologically equivalent.
The regions are separated by the following values of m:
The points 0, 1 and
are the only values of m affecting the recognition problem,
all the other distinguished values of m are associated with the universal unfolding.
There is a "symmetry" with respect to m in the behavior of the bifurcation
diagrams. For example, the difference in the diagrams for m < - t and m > 2 is
simply the exchange of label between the Rand S branches. Similarly for -t <
m < 0 and
< m < 2 and so on.
Although the example of normal form X treated in Golubitsky & Roberts is not
a gradient, its diagrams can be modified for the region 0 < m <
that is, only the

94
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
unfolding must be reorganized. Hence we only give here the bifurcation diagrams
for m <
(Figure 6.1) and
< m < 0 (Figure 6.2).
It is the normal form V that is important for the collision of multipliers at ±i
in reversible-symplectic maps. The classification in Tables 6.1 and 6.2 justifies the
result stated in Chapter 10.
The normal forms I-IV are of interest for the bifurcation of generic period-4
points (normal form I) and for the simple codimension one singularities of bifurcating
period-4 points (normal forms II-IV) in reversible-symplectic maps.
The normal form X corresponds to a singularity of codimension 2 in the bifurca-
tion of period-4 points. Although it requires families of reversible-symplectic maps
with three (at least) parameters (including the bifurcation parameter), it is not too
difficult to construct examples of such a family. The unfolding of the codimension
2 singularity provides interesting insight into global behavior in the bifurcation of
periodic points as it explains how some secondary bifurcations occur.

7. Reversibility and degenerate bifurcation
of period-q points of multiparameter maps
The theory of Chapters 3 and 6 is used to classify the singular bifurcations of
period-q points (q = 3,4,5) for a class of maps based on the generalized standard
map. These bifurcations will also occur in higher dimensional maps - to which the
theory also applies - but the simplest context is the area-preserving case.
Singu-
larities that require a higher dimensional phase space are considered in Chapters 9
and 10.
Actually, all that is necessary to apply in a straightforward manner our Dq-
theory (that is in addition to the natural Zq-symmetry there is a non-trivial in-
volution of the required type resulting in a Dq-symmetry) are CS-reversible maps.
CS-reversible maps are symplectic maps that are reversible in configuration space
only (hence their name, see Appendix F). However, we show in Proposition FA that
CS-reversibility is in fact equivalent to the standard definition of reversibility (that
is anti-symplectic involution on the phase space in standard form: diag(In, -In) =
K 181 In' d. (2.23)) modulo symplectic changes of coordinates. Therefore, without
loss of generality, we consider here a family of maps (7.1) that are not x-reversible
but easily CS-reversible with respect to our classical action of Dq •
In Section 7.1, the generic bifurcation of period-3 points in CS-reversible sym-
plectic maps is considered. From the theory in Chapter 6 we know that the normal
form is in 1-1 correspondence with the potential H( u, v, >') = !fl>'U+iOlv (see Sec-
tion 6.1) provided H: . H/:>. 1:- 0 (in Chapter 9 we consider the singularity H/:>. = 0).
In Sections 7.1 and 7.2 we study the effect of the singularity H: = 0 on the
bifurcation of period-3 and period-4 points, respectively.
In Section 7.3 we carry
out the computations for the generic bifurcation of period-5 points.
The theory is applied to a class of maps that is a special case of the generalized
standard map (cf. Chapter 5):
X' =
X +y',
y' = y - Vx(x, A),
where V : R x Rk -> R is a smooth function depending on parameters A E Rk.
The origin is a fixed point of (7.1) if we assume that for some value A = 0
VO = v.,0 = o.
(7.1)

102
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
Associated with the map (7.1) is the generating function
h(x, Xl, A) = t(x - xl ) 2 - V(x, A).
Let a =
then the linearization of (7.1) about the trivial solution is
(7.2)
If the origin is an elliptic fixed point the multipliers lie at e±i//, B E R, and a satisfies
a = 2(1- cosB).
The map (7.1) is reversible with the anti-symplectic reversor
R=(l -1)

(that is
RTJR=-J).
It is also CS-reversible as the action W q is Dq-invariant on
when h is given by

The nonlinear term 2:1=1 V(x i , A) is invariant under any permutation of x E
and the norm Ilxll is invariant with respect to the orthogonal group with contains
rq and K q • It remains to verify that the term (x, (rq + ri) x} is Zi-invariant.
But this follows from the identity KqrqKq = r[.
By the Equivariant Splitting
Lemma the Dq-invariance of Wq is inherited by the reduced functional Wq on R2 , in
particular, the normal form for the bifurcating period-q points of the map (7.1) is a
Dq-equivariant gradient map on R2 .
In this chapter we take (} = 2". with q = 3,4 and 5 and compute normal forms
q
for the bifurcation equations for period-q points as a function of Vi that is, as a
function of the Taylor coefficients a, b,c ... of V at the origin:
Based on the singularity theory of Chapter 6 we include all terms that may con-
tribute to finite determinacy. In the simplest cases (the generic theory for example)
only the first few Taylor coefficients contribute to the finite determinacy question
but for the higher codimension singularities (cod-l bifurcation of period-4 points for
example) all the Taylor coefficients a ... 9 may contribute to the normal form.

Using complex notation (z = Xl +iX2) the 03-equivariant gradient map associated
with W3 is
to which the D3-classification of Section 6.1 is applicable.
The basic result is the generic case; that is, if W2 =f:. 0 (or equivalently b =f:. 0)
then (7.5) is equivalent to
g(z,"\) = ,,\z+ I:Z2 ,
where
I: = -sign b, which recovers the classic result on period-3 points (Meyer
[1970]).
Using the Stability Lemma I 2.10, the stability is determined from
J = sign [Hess.,W3(X,"\)1.
For the normal form ,,\z + I:Z2 a simple calculation shows that J = -signu = -1
recovering the well known result that generic bifurcating period-S points are also
unstable in the reversible context (Meyer [1971]).
The isotropy subgroup of the period-3 points is
which is generated by the
reflection element in 0 3. This corresponds to the invariance under z
I-> Z in the
z·
normal form.
In term of sequences, the elements of the subspace X32

a two-dimensional subspace of

with 02 = hx'(x,o).
Two new interesting features appear when the coefficient W2 (or equivalently,
the coefficient b) goes through 0: the period-3 points in
can stabilize through a
turn in the bifurcation branch and symmetry-breaking bifurcations

can
take place resulting in new branches of period-3 points.

The universal unfolding is obtained by adding (,8 +rriA):z2 to (7.6) with (,8, in) E R2
in a neighborhood of O.
The non-degeneracy conditions are c =I- 0, d =I- 0 and
d2 + c3 - ec =I- O.
In addition to the trivial solution there are two classes of solutions of (7.6) and
they are listed in Table 7.1.

Note that the group orbit of Zz-branches is connected by the non-symmetric
branch. The non-symmetric branch is uniformly unstable (J < 0 independent of
parameters) but there exists a range of A in which both the (upper and lower)
branches of Zi-symmetric period-3 points are stable.
In Figure 7.5 we show how the bifurcation structure affects the phase portrait;
in particular the three families of period-3 points dominate the situation.

of A, in three Z3-orbits of period-3 points, two of which are stable. In particular it
is the structure of the families of period-S points that dominates the phase space
structure.
The area of the polygon formed by the bifurcating period-3 points takes a
particularly simple form in the normal form coordinates. The oriented area of an

7.2 Period-4 points with reversibility in multi-parameter maps
The bifurcation of period-4 points has a special structure because the invariants
and u 2 are of the same order and both enter the generic normal form producing
a modal parameter and a rich bifurcation structure.
In this section the normal forms for the generic and the three codimension
1 singularities (excluding the singularity M = 0 (see Chapter 9)) of bifurcating
period-4 points are constructed for the generalized standard map.
Let h, V be as defined in (7.1) and (7.2) and define the bifurcation parameter
A by V"",(O, A) = 2 - ..\. Then when ..\= 0 the multipliers of the linear map DTo lie
at ±i.

An application of the Splitting Lemma results in the reduced functional
It follows from the Splitting Lemma that the complementary functions 11 and 12
are 04-equivariant; in particular, using the reduced actions of 0 4 on the subspace

11(X1,X2,A) = 11(X2,-X1,A)

Therefore,

Note that there are two distinct classes of Z2-symmetric solutions. The solutions
with isotropy subgroup Z2 are the usual Z2-symmetric periodic points that are
invariant under (Xl, X2) f-+ (Xl, - X2) in the normal form but the Z2-solutions are
invariant under (Xl, X2) f-+ (X2, xI)·
Therefore the two classes of Z2-symmetric period-4 points correspond to distinct
symmetric sequences; in particular, X:; consists of sequences invariant under

Note that in phase space both sets lie in 4 dimensional subspaces of
respectively.
Stability properties of the bifurcating period-4 points are obtained using the
Stability Lemma I and are shown in Figure 7.6. If c < 0 there exists stable period-4
points of one type or the other but if c > 0 then c > b2 is necessary for stable
period-4 points.
There are two simple codimension-I singularities in the normal form (7.14)
which are obtained by taking b2 = c or c = 0 (see Figure 7.6). By simple it is meant
that nothing dramatic takes place in the bifurcation diagrams.
It is clear from Figure 7.6 that b2 = c corresponds to the Z2-branches changing
direction (subcritical to supercritical or the other way around) and c = 0 corresponds
to the Z2-branches changing bifurcation direction. The unfolding of the two simple
singularities results in a turn along bifurcation branches with an associated change
of stability. The normal forms are easily obtained using the information in equations
(7.11)-(7.13).
The third codimension-1 singularity corresponds to c + b2 = 0 in Figure 7.6
and is more interesting; in particular, the unfolding of the singularity results in a
secondary bifurcation of symmetry breaking period-4 points.
Application of the
classification of D4-equivariant gradient maps in Section 6.2 shows that, when c =

will go through a sequence of bifurcations much like that shown in Figure 7.3.
There is enough information in the reduced functional W4 in (7.11) (and enough
parameters) to analyze most of the codimension 2 singularities in the classification
of D4-equivariant gradient maps. Although these bifurcations are 3-parameter bi-
furcations (including the distinguished parameter ,\) they do provide interesting
organizing centers for the dynamics observed in the phase portraits.

If 2b2 - 3c f:- 0 and d + V5bc + b3 f:- 0 then there is a generic bifurcation of
period-5 points for 1..\1 and Ilxll sufficiently small. The bifurcation is supercritical
(subcritical) according to whether
1 = -1 ( 1 = 1) but the stability is determined
by the sign of J (= sign [Hessj.W5(X,..\)1).

Note that there are two families of period-5 points that join at the origin with
one stable and one unstable (recovering the classical result). Which family is stable

8. Periodic points of equivariant symplectic maps
The dynamics of equivariant symplectic maps is an interesting and largely unex-
plored area. Moreover symplectic maps with spatial symmetry are of great interest
in applications.
A simple example is the time­T map of a parametrically forced
(T­periodically) spherical pendulum. If the O(2)­spatial symmetry of the spherical
pendulum is not broken by the forcing (say by vertically forcing) then the time­T
map of the system is identified with an O(2)­equivariant symplectic map on R4 .
In this chapter we present a general theory for the bifurcation of period­q points
(from a fixed point) of equivariant symplectic maps on R2n which are generated by a
Lagrangian generating function. In the presence of symmetry, Floquet multipliers of
high multiplicity arise generically resulting in a large dimensional kernel of LO. The
bifurcation equations will therefore be posed on a large­dimensional space and our
approach ­ Splitting Lemma, singularity theory, normal forms ­ becomes rapidly
much more complicated.
In this chapter our approach will therefore be broken into two parts. It turns
out that we can obtain quite interesting, but rough, results using purely topological
methods.
We present this theory first.
Then, for the case when the group acts
absolutely irreducibly on configuration space we return to the more precise methods
­ Splitting Lemma, singularity theory and normal forms on fixed point subspaces -
to study the structure of the bifurcating period­q points.
The analysis is considerably simplified by working in configuration space (with
no loss of generality in the bifurcation theory, as in Proposition 2.2) through the
use of generating functions.
Therefore we consider only symmetries that act on
configuration space and lift to a symplectic action on the phase space (see the
discussion of more general group actions in Appendix I).
In Section 8.1 we analyze the problem using topological techniques that re-
quire only the gradient structure and group­theoretic properties of the functional.
With minimal non­degeneracy hypotheses, lower bounds on the number of conjugacy
classes of bifurcating period­q points and their symmetry group are obtained.
For a
symplectic map, we prove the existence of a conjugacy class
of bifurcating period­q points for each isotropy subgroup II c
X Zq (the spatio-
temporal group of symmetries) provided the q­resonant eigenspace of DTo satisfies
some nondegeneracy assumptions (precisely defined in Section 8.1). Clearly it does
not mean that for every isotropy subgroup II we have solutions with exact isotropy
II, it means that for every II we have solutions with at least that symmetry. In
particular, in case the action of
is absolutely irreducible, we find solutions with
the symmetry of every maximal isotropy subgroups contrary to what happens for

120
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
general maps where this is true only for maximal subgroups of fixed-point subspaces
of dimension 1.
This result generalizes - to bifurcating period-q points near symmetric period-1
points of symplectic maps - the equivariant "Weinstein-Moser'' theory for periodic
orbits near symmetric equilibria of continuous-time Hamiltonian systems (d. Mon-
taldi, Roberts & Stewart [1988]).
When the symplectic map is equivariant with respect to a continuous Lie group
two new interesting features arise in the bifurcation of period-q points. First, the
continuous symmetry induces - by a variant of Noether's Theorem - a conserved
quantity (see Appendix E). In which case, the orbits of the symplectic map will lie
on an invariant submanifold (or subset when singular) of the phase space.
Second, the symmetry results in geometrically distinct classes of periodic points.
For example there are classes of periodic points which "ride on the group orbit".
These orbits are reminiscent of relative equilibria of continuous Hamiltonian systems.
There are also periodic points that break the symmetry; that is, the orbit of the
period-q point is "transverse" to the group orbit. Both of these types of periodic
points occur in O(2)-equivariant symplectic maps for example.
In Section 8.2 we illustrate the results of the general framework of Section 8.1
in the important example of a compact Lie group
that acts absolutely irreducibly
on the configuration space and so as a direct sum of absolutely irreducible represen-
tations on the phase space.
With the spherical pendulum as motivation, the results of Section 8.2 are ap-
plied to O(2)-equivariant symplectic maps in Section 8.3. It is shown that generically
there are three distinct classes of period-q points for each q, 3 ::; q < 00.
There is a family of period-q points that rides on the O(2)-group orbit: these
are analogous to the conical pendulum solutions in the unforced spherical pendulum.
There are also two families of period-q points with orbits that are transverse
to the O(2)-group orbits: these are analogous to the planar pendulum solutions in
the unforced spherical pendulum.
There are other interesting orbits of O(2)-equivariant symplectic maps that we
do not consider: for example, the period-q points that lie transverse to the group
orbit can drift along the group orbit resulting in a "relative invariant circle"; an
invariant circle in a frame of reference that drifts along the SO(2)-group orbit.
In Section 8.4 the results on bifurcations of O(2)-equivariant symplectic maps
are discussed with reference to the parametrically forced spherical pendulum.
In Section 8.5 we show how to apply the reduction to O(2)-orbit space and
give some immediate consequences of that procedure.
In particular the reduced
phase space is now equipped with a Poisson structure and the symplectomorphism
is reduced to a Poisson map.
Finally in Section 8.6 we sketch some preliminary comments on the linearized
stability question for O(2)-equivariant symplectic maps.

(x', y') on R2n generated by h(z ,x', A). As previously we assume that the parameter
A splits into the main bifurcation parameter >. (usually one dimensional) and the
perturbation (unfolding) parameters (a, ;3).
Suppose, moreover, that there is a compact Lie group
acting orthogonally on
Rn such that h is invariant under the diagonal action of
on R2n ; that is
h(I7X,I7X',A) = h(x,x',A),

We refer to the Appendix I for further discussion of symmetry, generating functions
and maps. We can use the isotypic decomposition of Rn to block diagonalize the
problem. In Chapter XII of Golubitsky, Stewart & Schaeffer II [1988] one can find
the relevant background and proofs. The details necessary for the present analysis
are as follows.
We can split Rn into the direct sum of
subspaces {Vi ll=I' each the
direct sum of isomorphic irreducible subspaces {W, ll=l. A characterization of the
irreducible representations of

where {ndl=1 c N and the Wi'S are pairwise non-isomorphic. Note that, although
for notational convenience we sometimes use the Ki-linear structures, we are only
interested in the real structure associated with the vector spaces (and linear opera-
tors) we are working with. Denote by a subscript i the action of
on Wi. Then the
action of

where A; E Homjc, (K?' ,K?') and similarly for Band C. Depending on the context,
we denote by the same A; the K;-matrix or the associated real maps. And so, the
linear Il-equivariant map DT(A) = DT(O, 0, A) can be block-diagonalized as
I
DT = EB DT; @K; Iw; ,

where
(8.2)
The transpose/inverse matrix is to be understood as the K;-conjugate/ K;-
inverse equivalent to the same concept for the associated real map.
When no group is acting, all the symplectic operators are equivalent (Darboux
Theorem) and we choose J 2n for the canonical operator. This forces the relation
(1.1) between a map and its generating function.
Note that (1.1) also forces the
Il-action on R2n to be the direct sum of the actions on Rn. In the equivariant case
some care is necessary for the symplectic structure as we would like to use only
Il-equivariant changes of coordinates.
The problem of the symplectic structure can be tackled block by block in the
isotypic decomposition. For the real and quaternionic blocks the theory is straight-
forward, all the operators are equivalent by I;-equivariant changes of coordinates
and so we can take J 2n . The problem is more subtle for the complex blocks as there
are n; + 1 different symplectic operators (cf. Appendix I), but only J 2n is compati-
ble with (1.1). In this chapter we are going to consider only absolutely irreducible
representations of I;; therefore, for simplicity, we use only the symplectic operators
induced by J 2n •
The following result tells us how to compute the spectrum of DT in the complex
or quaternionic cases. We denote by 17K, (M) the spectrum of M as a K;-linear map.
Lemma 8.1. Let M be a complex matrix representing a linear map on R2n via the
isomorphism C" ---> R2n defined by:r + iy f-> (x,y).
Then,
(a) O"R(M) = O"c(M) UO"c(M) ,
(b) the (generalized) eigenspaces for tL E (Tc(M), respectively Ji
E (Tc(M), are
generated by the vectors {(v, -iv)}, respectively {(ii, iii)}, where v is in the
(generalized) C-eigenspace of M.
Proof. The proofs of (a) and (b) are simple calculations as M = A +i B corresponds
to the real matrix

Lemma 8.2. Let M be a quaiernionic matrix representing a linear map on R4n via
the isomorphism H" -. R4n defined by x + i y + j z + k w 1-+ (x, y, z, w ).
Moreover,
from the decomposition M = A + i B + j C + k D, with A, B, C, D E Mn(R), define
the following complex matrix

Then,
(a) uR(M) = uc(N) U uc(N),
(b) the (generalized) eigenspaces for J.l E uc(N), respectively ji E uc(N), are gene-
rated by the vectors {(v,­iv)}, respectively {(v,iv)}, where v is in the (genera-
lized) C­eigenspace of N,

to an eigenvector (0, -i 0, /3, i /3) for 17 E uR(M) iff M q = q 1].
Proof. As for Lemma 8.1, those results are simple calculations. Note that for (a)
and (b) we can use the previous results for complex matrices as M corresponds to
the complex matrix N = A' + i B' where

Clearly uR(DT) = Ui uR(DTi) and each eigenvalue of uR{DTi) has its multi-

That is, the set of fixed points (0,0, A) is isolated. The second hypothesis concerns
the resonant subspace of period-q.
For any integer q :::: 2, we define the q­resonant subspace of T at the origin,
denoted by Nq , as the real part of the sum of the eigenspaces of DTo corresponding
to the eigenvalues of the type exp (2p rri),°< p < q. Note that we do not require t:

to be reduced; this allows for points of period dividing q to be also considered.
For our analysis, it is useful if T and Nq satisfy some conditions.

SINGULARlTIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
Condition (a) means that the linearization DTo has at least a periodic orbit
of exact period q.
Condition (c) is an "equivalent" condition to (HO) in Section
2.1. Condition (HO) has been introduced to justify the use of the one-parameter (A)
normal form of DT (in the sense of symplectomorphisms, Proposition 2.2). Because
of the symmetry, we cannot avoid multiplicity here, but (c) means that we only
consider the multiplicities forced by symmetry. Note that (c) does not exclude having
equal eigenvalues in different blocks, but that is considered as mode interactions
where we can introduce the interaction-breaking parameters as unfolding parameters
for the variational problem Wq we later define for the period-q points (see also the
discussion of simple mode-interactions in Appendix J).
We refer to the comments in Section 2.1 about relaxing condition (c). In par-
ticular we can ask DTOINq to be only semi-simple. But then, a one dimensional A
must be thought of as defining a path into the multiparameter (let's say m) normal
form (in the sense of symplectomorphisms) of DTo. In that case, it might therefore
be more natural for A to be m-dimensional and the setting of the problem should be
m distinguished parameters bifurcation theory. In Chapters 9 and 10 we are going
to consider the main case when (c) is not satisfied: the collision of multipliers.
We are looking for the bifurcation from the origin of period-q points of a given
family of symplectomorphisms T. A necessary condition is for Nq to be non empty.
Actually, we are asking more, that T is q-regular (at the origin).
As in Section 2.1, a variational problem can be defined for the existence of
period-q points. Let
Then a period-q point of the symplectic map T is a critical point in X; of the
following functional:
q
Wq(x,A) = L h(xi , X i+1 , A ) =
(x, L(A)x) +N(x,A),
i=l
where
L(A) = Iq @R (A + C)(A) - rq 0R B(A) - ri @R BT(A).
(8.4)
As previously, it is a straightforward calculation to see that Wq is
x Zq-invariant
where the action of Zq on X; is generated by rq @R In and
acts on X; as I q @R (1,

The next step is to apply the Equivariant Splitting Lemma to Wq to get the
reduced bifurcation equations. For that, we need some information on the Hessian
er w;
Define w =

consider the bifurcation of fixed points, JtqI :s; q - 1.

Let F be the Fourier matrix defined in (2.16) and denote by <Flp+l

vector space generated by the real and imaginary parts of the (p + 1)-th column of

Proof. The proof of part (a) is an exercise using the explicit form of DTi in (8.2).
For part (b), consider the eigenvalue problem
(8.5)
The idea is to block diagonalize LO using the Fourier matrix F. As in the proof of
Proposition 2.3, we define z = F 0R In . Z 0R w. From the explicit form for LO, the
eigenvalue problem (8.5) can be written as
where n = diag(1,w, ... ,wq- l ) . As (8.6) is a block diagonal eigenvalue problem, we
can conclude.
The proof of part (c) is obtained by explicitly solving (8.6).
•
Following the ideas used previously ill Section 2.3 we can construct an action
for
x Zq on Ker LO; in particular f q acts as
(8.7)
for {PI, ... ,Plt.1 } = t q with at least one of the Pi'S coprime with q, and a acts as

We have now satisfied all the requirements of the Equivariant Splitting Lemma
of Appendix A. Therefore the solutions of the operator equation on X;
V'xWq{x. A) = 0

are in 1-1 correspondence with the solutions of the reduced bifurcation equations
on Ker L":
(8.9)
Moreover, Wq IS
x Zq-invariant with the group action as described in (8.7) and
(8.8).
What we want now is to get a-priori estimates on the number of solutions of
(8.9) using the group equivariance and the gradient structure. More precisely, we
are going to derive bounds on the number of solutions in each fixed-point subspace
We refer to GSS II [1988] for background information on bifurcation with sym-
metry.
Let II be a proper isotropy subgroup of
x Zq.
From the principle of
symmetric criticality (Palais [1979]), the periodic orbits of isotropy containing at
least II are critical points of Wn, the restriction of the functional W q to Fix II.
Denote by Nil the normalizer of II in
x Zq; that is, the elements of
x Zq
commuting with II. It is well-known that II induces the symmetry WII
Nil/II on
Fix II (WII is the Weyl subgroup associated with II).
We can use the special structure of
X Zq to good effect.
We use the short
notation L; for I x L; C
X Zq. Define the temporal subgroup corresponding to II
by Z;(I1) = II n Zq, where r is the integer given by Z;(II) = Zqjr' Fix II contains
only period-r (or less) orbits.
As Fix Zq is trivial and II
-=1=
x Zq, note that
1 < r :S q.
Every element of t, commutes with II.
That is, WII contains t.:
Zr(WII)
Zq/Z;(I1) with 1 < r :S q.
Two situations arise: first, if II = I;' x Z;(II) with
C
then Fix II contains
period-r orbits with only spatial symmetries, and we call II a r-spaiial subgroup.
Otherwise, the orbits in Fix II are invariant by some combined space and time
actions, in that case we call such II a r-spatio-temporal subgroup.
From Appendix N (Proposition N.1) all isotropy subgroups are twisted sub-
groups, that is, there exists a subgroup =: C
and a group homomorphism () :
---+
Zr(WII) such that
II = =:9 x Z;(II)
{(u, (}(u)) I o E =:} xZ;(I1).
We list the principal results on twisted subgroups in Appendix N.
Moreover, we need the following fundamental property of the WII-symmetry.
Lemma 8.4. Fix WII = {0 } .
Proof. FixWII is contained into Fix Zr(WII) n Fix II. Now, suppose that
Fix ZrCWII) n Fix II
-=1= {O} ,

8. EQUIVARIANT SYMPLECTIC MAPS
127
(8.10)
then there exists a nontrivial v E Fix II such that, v = v, 'V, E Zr(WII).
Any
8 E Zq can be decomposed as 8 = 8182 with 81 E Zr(WII) and 82 E Z;(II). And so,
8 v = 8182V = 81V = v, that is v E Fix Zq, hence v = O. From the contradiction,
FixZr(WII) nFixll = {OJ and so FixWII = {OJ.
•
We need a last regularity condition. As DTOINq is semi-simple we can associate
to each pair of multipliers a signature Ej (cf. Appendix B). We then assume that
we can find coordinates on Ker U such that, as in (2.30), the quadratic part of Wq
is given by
L
EjAIXjI2,
j=1
where Ej is the signature of the j-th multiplier counted with multiplicity. To get the
A-dependence in (8.10) we might have, as in Proposition 2.2, to choose a particular
parameter A for L(A) satisfying the transversality condition (8.10). We say that II
is T-nondegen.erate if (8.10) is satisfied and the trace of
(Hess WIT)
is nonzero and in that case we call the absolute value of that trace the critical
dimension of II, denoted by c(II). The critical dimension of II is the absolute value
of the algebraic sum of the signatures of the relevant multipliers. The transversality
condition (8.10) for L(A) can be relaxed in various ways (cf. Chapter 2). We can
now state the main results. The first theorem is the most general in the present
context.
Theorem 8.5. Let T : (X,y,A)
I--> (xl,y') be a smooth one parameter family of
symplectic maps on R2n generated by hex, Xl,A).
Let
be a compact Lie group
acting orthogonally on Rn. Suppose:
(a) h is
under the diagonal action of
on R2n ,
(b) T is q-regular for some q ? 2.
Then, for every notuleqenerate isotropy subgroup II c
XZq (IT can be trivial),
there exist right and left open neighborhoods L; II C R of 0, integers in il ? 0 and
d(lI) ? 1 such that i; +il ? d(lI) and that for A E I., resp. It, there are at least i r ,
resp, ii, distinct WII-orbits of trajectories of period q-poinis of isotropy at least II
bifurcating from the origin (that is, of norm as small as we want).
Remarks. It is important for A to be unidimensional.
Similar results for mul-
tidimensional parameters are much harder to get because of the continuity of the
Morse index and the connexity of S" for n ? 1 (cf. Bartsch [1992a]). In particular
it means that the perturbation parameters (0, /3) are considered as fixed. This ap-
proach does not distinguish between the different levels of degeneracy (codimension)

128
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
of the bifurcation equations and so the bound we obtain is a lower bound for any
such problem with the same equivariant structure.
The number d(II) is defined in Bartsch [1992b] from the difference when .\
crosses 0 of the "length" of the exit-set of an isolated invariant set around the
origin. In our context it corresponds to the difference of dimensions of the unstable
manifold of the origin when .\ change sign (d. also Bartsch & Clapp [1990]). We
refer to those papers for the theory and to the Remark (a) thereafter for some typical
values.
Proof. The discussions prior to the statement of the theorem were in preparation for
the application of results on the bifurcation of critical points of invariant functionals.
In particular, we use Theorem 7.12 of Bartsch [1992b]. From Lemma 8.4 above, Fix
WII is trivial. The other assumptions of Theorem 6.3 of Bartsch are verified from our
hypotheses. Rewriting the conclusions of that theorem, they become our conclusions
of Theorem 8.5. From classical theory, for instance Kielhofer [1988], we know that
d(II)
1.
•
Corollaries, remarks. (a) In applications WII is often isomorphic to (Zqr
or
(51r for some r
O. In those cases d(II) is given, respectively, by d((Zqr) =
c(II) when q is a prime number or by d((51n =
c(II).
When the maximal torus of WII (its largest abelian subgroup) acts without
fixed points, we can also use the previous results (d. Bartsch [1992b] or also
Proposition 2.6 of Bartsch & Clapp [1990]).
(b) If II is a maximal (with respect to inclusion) isotropy subgroup, then the
isotropy of the orbits is exactly II.
An interesting class of maximal isotropy
subgroups are those with 2D-fixed points subspaces.
Those are always non-
degenerate.
(c) Theorem 8.5 applies also when
is trivial. In that case, if there is some isotropy
subgroup, it must be some
r dividing q, and so WII = Zr, 1 < r :::; q, where
r is the period of the elements of Fix II.
(d) As in Montaldi, Roberts & Stewart [1988], we can use that WIT is Zr(WII)-
invariant.
Then, from the Zr-theory, we get c(II) distinct Zr(WII)-orbits of
trajectories of period-q points, but we cannot rule out that some spatia-temporal
symmetry in WII cannot bring one trajectory into another.
To illustrate the problem touched in (d) we can consider the following sim-
ple example. Consider the canonical SO(2)-action on R2 by rotation. An SO(2)-
invariant function fo on R2 is also Z2-invariant with the action being (x, y)
f-+
(-x, -y) (for instance). From (a) we know that fo has at least one SO(2)-orbit of
critical points but at least two Z2-orbits. Those two orbits are not Z2-conjugate,
that is, they are any couple of (non antipodal) points but they are SO(2)-conjugate,
hence the existence of only one SO(2)-orbit. This example shows that it is useful

8. EQUIVARIANT SYMPLECTIC MAPS
129
to keep in mind that we might not have identified the more powerful symmetry
framework and if it is so, to interpret cautiously the results.
For the next result we use the classical approach to transform the problem into
finding the critical points of an equivalent functional on topological spheres. We
get more information but at the cost of more stringent hypotheses on the quadratic
part (8.10) (cf. Appendix L).
Theorem 8.6.
Let T : (x,y,>.)
f-+ (X',y/) be a smooth one parameter family of
symplectic maps on R2n generated by h(X, x', >.).
Let:E be a compact Lie group
acting orthogonally on Rn. Suppose:
(a) h is :E-invariant under the diagonal action of:E on R2n,
(b) T is q-regular for some q ? 2.
Then for every isotropy subgroup IT C :ExZq such that the siqnatures of the mul-
tipliers corresponding to Fix IT are of the same sign, there are at least catwrrFix IT
WIT-orbits of trajectories of period-q points with isotropy at least IT bifurcating from
the origin for finite (cf. Appendix L) Wrr, the action restricted to Fix IT.
The integer catwrrFix IT is the WIT Lusternik-Schnirelman category of the unit
sphere in Fix IT (cf. Bartsch [1989j). Lower bounds for it are given in the following
Remark (a).
Proof. In this situation, because of the special form of the linearization, we can
use Proposition L.2 which shows that we can use invariant critical point theory to
count the distinct orbits on a small enough topological sphere around the origin in
Ker LO x R using the equivariant Lusternik-Schnirelman category.
•
We refer to our references for further discussions of the equivariant Lusternik-
Schnirelman category.
Corollaries, remarks. (a) Estimates of catwrrFix IT are as follows. Order the
subsets of WIT by conjugation and consider {Hill=1' the set of maximal classes
of isotropy subgroups of the action of WIT on Fix IT. Then
tI: c(Hd
catwrrFix IT,
;=1
where c(H;) '= 2 if WwrrH;= {1} (the Weyl group for H; C WIT) or
otherwise (cf. Bartsch [1989] or Krawcewicz & Marzantowicz [1990]).
(b) The finiteness of Wrr is a technical condition and we conjecture that it could
be lifted (we refer to Appendix L for further discussion on the issue).

130
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
In particular, Wrr is finite if the parameter ,\ does not appear in terms of
degree 3 or higher or if \7xWrr is finitely
(that is, as a bifurcation
problem).
Note that the only fundamental additional hypothesis for Theorem 8.6 - com-
pared with Theorem 8.5 - is that the signatures of the corresponding multipliers be
the same. This last theorem will find an application in the next section where the
signatures of the multipliers are forced to be equal by symmetry. Note that we can
think of the condition on the multipliers as the pendant of the condition of definite-
ness of the Hamiltonian function in the "Weinstein-Moser" theory for bifurcation in
Hamiltonian flows.
8.2 Bifurcation of subharmonics when
acts absolutely irreducibly
on Rn - the configuration space
An important example of the theory of last section is provided when
acts
absolutely irreducibly on Rn, the configuration space. In the previous set-up, i = 1
and K 1 = R. The fact that
acts absolutely irreducibly severely restricts the form
of the
generating function h: the matrices A, Band C are forced to
be scalar multiples of the identity and it is enough (and so natural) to control the
multipliers of DTo with one parameter only, say '\, as the coefficients of the higher
order terms of h will still depend on A = ('\, (3) where (3 represents the perturbation
(multi)parameter. Hence, h takes the form:
h(x, x', A) =
-
x') +
,x') + h(x,x',A).
(8.11 )
The requirement that
=I- 0 reduces to b" =I- O. The linear part of the symplectic
map generated by h in (8.11) has the form
1 (
a
DT = b
ac _ b2
with characteristic equation
= (1l2- t (a+c)Il +1)n=0.
Therefore if
a" + CO - 2bo cos() = 0
for
() = 2: 1r ,
(8.12)
the map DTo has a rational multiplier ei B of multiplicity n. This time, without limi-
ting the generality, we require ]J and q to be coprime. Moreover, (8.12) determines
uniquely () as a function of ,\ near O.
The operator (8.4) is then
L('\) = [(a('\) + c(,\») I q - b(oX)(rq + r{)] @In .
(8.13)

8. EQUIVARIANT SYMPLECTIC MAPS
131
From Proposition B.3, the signature of each of the n multipliers at ei lJ is of the same
sign; in particular, it is equal to the sign of b",
As a direct consequence of Theorem 8.6 we can now state the main result on
spontaneous symmetry breaking of bifurcating period-q points.
Theorem 8.7.
Let T : (x,y,A)
f-+ (x',y') be a smooth A-parametrized family of
symplectic maps on R2n generated by h.
We assume that h is '2;-invariant where '2;
is a compact Lie group acting absolutely irreducibly on the configuration space. We
fix the perturbation parameter f3 and suppose that
(a)
h is of the form (8.11) and satisfies (8.12) with (p,q) = 1 and q
3,
(b)
= a>. + c>. # o.
Then, for every isotropy subgroup II C '2;x Zq there are at least catwnFix II WII-
orbits of trajectories of period-q points whose symmetry group is at least '2; bifurcating
from the origin for finite Wn (cf.
Theorem 8.6).
Proof. Theorem 8.7 is a direct consequence of Theorem 8.6 as the signatures of
the multipliers are equal, forced by symmetry. Condition (b) simply means that the
quadratic part of the action is of the form (8.10). It could be replaced by 8(-X)· -X > 0
for -X small.
•
Theorem 8.7 makes the discussion of the lattice of the isotropy subgroups and
the dimensions of their fixed-point subspaces particularly useful.
In Appendix N
we have formulas for the dimensions of the fixed-points subspaces for the twisted
subgroups when q = 1,2,3,4 and 6.
In the remainder of Chapter 8 we are going back to a more precise analysis of
the bifurcation equations, for example of 0(2)-equivariant 4D-maps.
In that case we expect 2D-fixed point subspaces. And so, as Zr(WII) c WII C
SO(2), Wn will be Zr-invariant with r
2 or SO(2)-invariant.
SO(2)-invariant
functions on R2 can be reduced to Z2-invariant functions by taking a point on the
orbit. Therefore, in cases where Fix II is two-dimensional, finite-determinacy results
for the bifurcating period-q points can be obtained by application of singularity
theory for Zr-equivariant gradient maps for some r
2.
The case where Wq reduces to an SO(2)-invariant functional on Fix II is an
interesting case and corresponds to a circle of bifurcating period-q points. Rather
than q-distinct points, the set of initial conditions resulting in period-q points is
a circle and coincides with the continuous symmetry. This occurs for example in
0(2)-equivariant symplectic maps.

[1988, p.450]).

It is natural to control the multipliers of DTo with only one parameter, say
A (cf. (8.11)). Moreover, with a scaling of x,x' and choosing the sign of the twist
to be negative (it only means that we authorize a change of orientation of the y-
coordinate), we can express any smooth 0(2)-invariant generating function of twist
maps in the form
h(x,x' ,A) =
- (x, x') +
x') + h(U, V, W, A)
where a,e: R -> Rand

and in particular there are no terms of third order in x, x' .
Comparison of (8.16) with (8.12) shows that when
aO + eO = 2cos 9 - 1
for
9 = 77r,

the linear map DTo has a double multiplier at ei B with positive definite signature.

Although the SO(2)-symmetry is a spatial symmetry and the Zq-symmetry is a tem-
poral symmetry, the group-theoretic properties of the lattice of isotropy subgroups
of 0(2) x Zq are reminiscent of the lattice for On X S1 (see GSS II [1988, p.368-9]).
On the other hand the fact that the continuous symmetry is a spatial symmetry
and the discrete Zq is associated with time leads to rather different orbit structures.

The classes of period-q points have very interesting geometric properties. In
the next section we will discuss a physical interpretation of the different classes
of periodic points but a rough idea of their nature is obtainable from the group-

Figure 8.1: Period-4 points in the class 14
The periodic points with 1q-symmetry ride on the 80(2)-group-orbit. That
is, a single discrete time step corresponds to a Zq (C 80(2)) spatial rotation. The
fact that the continuous group orbit coincides with the discrete orbit of the periodic
point results in a continuum of periodic points.
In essence these periodic points
are "integrable" orbits. We will give a more detailed analysis of the normal form
shortly, but, the coincidence of the group orbit and the map orbit results in extra
symmetry in the normal form.
For example the case q = 4 is shown in Figure 8.1. An orbit of a period-4 point
is shown but the image of the orbit under 80(2) = (Re ) is also a period-4 point;
hence a circle of period-4 points. Similarly for any q ;::: 3.

The second and third classes of period-q points are "standing orbits". Their
orbits lie in planes transverse to the group orbit. An example with q = 4 is shown

136
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
in Figure 8.2. It is not difficult to show that these periodic points are associated
with "zero angular momentum" (see discussion at the end of Section 8.3).
Note that by Theorem E and Example 1 of Appendix E, the O(2)-equivariant
A-family of maps T has a conserved quantity
I=(y,Jx}.
We say that an orbit of the map has zero angular momentum if the initial point
satisfies (y, J x) = O.
In particular the second and third classes of bifurcating
period-q points in Table 8.1 are associated with zero angular momentum.
The
invariant I gives an interesting geometrical structure to the phase space of the map.
Proposition 8.11.
Orbits of the O(2)-equivariant symplectic map with initial
points satisfying (yO, J XO) -I 0 lie in the interior of a solid torus.
Proof. By Theorem E the form I = (y, Jx) is conserved and when I -I 0 take
without loss of generality I> O. Then
I =
::I'
that is, with a suitable scaling of x and y the manifold associated with I -lOis
reminiscent of sp(2, R).
Now use the classic Gel'fand-Lidskii parametrization of
sp(2, R) scaled by VI,
Xl = VI (coshT sin 7/> +sinhr sin( B+7/»),
X2 = Vi (coshT cos 7/> - sinhr cos(B+ 7/»),
Y1 = Vi (coshT cos7/> + sinhr cosff + 7/»),
Y2 = Vi (- coshr sin 7/> + sinhr sinfe' + 7/»).
The interior of a solid torus is obtained by taking r = tanh2T and (B, 7/»
E 51 X 51
(Gel'fand & Lidskii [1955, p.l71]). Note that the solid torus is not compact, the
boundary r = 1 is not included.
•
In the degenerate case where ('If, J XO) = 0 the orbit of (XO, yO) lies on a
singular 3-manifold. Moreover if (x, y) E Fix t;,R4> for any ¢J E 51, then (y, Jx) = O.
In other words, for any fixed ¢J E 51 the map T restricted to Fix KR4> is a A-family of
singular area-preserving maps. However for any initial condition with (x, Jy) -#0
the orbit of the map will drift along the group orbit leading to interesting geometric
configurations in the phase space.

therefore the
80(2) x lq-invariants are ZIZI, Z2Z2, (zlz2F' and (zlz2F' (using the relation to
eliminate (ZIZ2)(ZIZ2)). Finally, with ZI = XI + iX2 and Z2 = X3 + iX4 the x-action
reduces the invariants to the four given in (8.23).

Application of singularity theory to the the full 0(2) x lq-invariant functional
(8.21) on R4 is beyond the scope of our work. But we can restrict Wq to the two-
dimensional fixed point spaces of isotropy I;i, 1 :s: i :s: 3, and study the resulting
bifurcation equations (for instance by applying the singularity theory of Chapter 3
or simply by solving explicitly the equations).
Let u , v and W be the usual invariants for Zq on R2 (d. 4.1). Then Table 8.2

there exists a bifurcating circle of period-q points.
On Fix Ih and Fix Il, the details of the analysis of the problem depends on
the parity of q.
When q is even, in particular when q = 4, we get a Zq-invariant functional on
R2, but when q is odd we get a Z2q-invariant functional, both of which are familiar
from the setting of generic bifurcation of period-q(2q) points. Theorem 2.7 is applied
to show the existence of bifurcating period-q points with symmetry group II2 and
II3 respectively.

bifurcation of period-q points are

Since the coefficients n] '"
n4 are expressed in terms of the general Taylor expansion
of h, explicit non-degeneracy conditions for generic bifurcation can be constructed.
The fact that the reduced functional is :llq-invariant, when q is odd, is a ra-
mification of Corollary 2.8.
Recall that setting: when there exists a Z2 that acts
as minus the identity on KerLO (or in the present case on KerLOIFixflj' j = 2,3),
then the reduced functional is Z2q-invariant (see the proof of Corollary 2.8).
The
Z2-action that reduces to -I for II2 and II 3 in the present case is the restriction of
the rotation by 1r in SO(2).
And so, there are 3 geometrically distinct classes of period-q points: the family
II] has a continuum of period-q points and each of the families II2 and II 3 has two
distinct classes of period-q points.

ii(lJ'q,lJ'p,t) = H(q,p,t) ,

and moreover there is a conserved quantity, the "angular momentum".

Proposition 8.13. Let H be a time-dependent O(2)-invariant Hamiltonian. Then
I=(p,Jq}

Proof. As in (8.25), write H as H(Q,P, R, t). Then
VqH = 2 HQq + HRP
and
VpH = 2 Hp p + HR q
and HQ, Hp and HR are scalars. Now differentiate I with respect to t,

The spherical pendulum (see Figure 8.3) is an O(2)-invariant Hamiltonian and
when parametrically forced will have the form (8.25) with first integral (8.26). This
is demonstrated as follows.
Scale the variables and time in the pendulum so that
g = m = 1 = 1. Then the Lagrangian for the parametrically forced pendulum (say
vertical forcing of the point of attachment) with periodic forcing /(i), is

It is evident that the Lagrangian is O(2)-invariant because it depends only on
(xZ+ y2), (xZ+ yZ) and (xx + yiJ).
Now, let qi = x, qz = Y and, with PI = 8£/8x and PZ = 8£/8iJ and use the
Legendre transform to obtain the Hamiltonian formulation.
The Hamiltonian is
easily found to be
ii = t(pi +

(qIPI + qzpz) j(t) - t(1- qi - qD P
= tP - tRZ - [1 + j(t) R + j(t)2 vT=Q] vT=Q
and by Proposition 8.13 the integral I = (p, Jq) is conserved. For the spherical
pendulum, I corresponds to the angular momentum.
When I(t) = 0 the spherical pendulum is completely integrable and there are
(for low amplitudes) three types of orbits. Figure 8.4 shows the energy-momentum
space for low energy (see Cushman [1983]). For higher energies the topology of the
(ii,1) space is more complicated (Cushman [1983]) but we will restrict attention to
the effect of parametric forcing at low energies.

The line I = 0 corresponds to

8. EQUIVARIANT SYMPLECTIC MAPS
143
zero angular momentum in which case the pendulum motion is confined to a plane:
the system reduces to a one degree of freedom Hamiltonian system. These periodic
orbits have 12 EEl 1 2 symmetry (see Example 1.3 of Montaldi, Roberts & Stewart
[1988]).
When I = l max a family of geometrically distinct periodic orbits occurs: the
conical pendulum solutions.
For a given value of the energy they correspond to
maxima of the angular momentum (01' minima for counter-rotating conical pendu-
lum solutions). These solutions have SO(2)-symmetry; a shift in time corresponds
to a shift in the spatial group SO(2). The conical pendulum solutions ride on the
SO(2)-group-orbit. For given fj, every value of I E (0, [max) corresponds to a flow
on a torus (rational or irrational depending on the values of (fj ,I)). The flow is
completely integrable so the rotation number varies smoothly between rational and
irrational values. For the spherical pendulum, the tori are associated with the drift
of the planar pendulum solutions along the SO(2)-group orbit.
When the spherical pendulum is parametrically forced periodically with period-
T, the natural- Poincare section is the time-T map of the flow. The time-T map will
be a symplectic map on R4 that is equivariant with respect to 0(2) (assuming the
forcing is placed so that the 0(2)-symmetry is not broken) and depends on three
parameters: the amplitude and frequency of the forcing and the angular momentum.
In the case of zero angular momentum the problem reduces to the parametri-
cally forced planar pendulum and the map reduces to an area-preserving map. The
second and third classes of periodic points in Table 8.1 correspond to period-q points
of the map at zero-angular momentum.
When the angular momentum is perturbed away from zero the whole structure
of the area-preserving map, in the fixed point space associated with the planar
pendulum, will drift along the group orbit. The orbits of the full symplectic map
in this case will behave like orbits of a torus map because the underlying orbit of
the autonomous Hamiltonian lies on a torus and, with periodic forcing, the time-T
map will behave locally like the map of a torus to itself. In this case we expect the
flow of the parametrically forced spherical pendulum to lie on a 3-torus.
For example, the picture on the cover shows a single orbit of the following model
0(2)-equivariant map:
x' = a x + y - d (xi + xD x
y' = ex' - x
where (x, y) E R2+2 and a, c, d are real scalars.
The above map is generated by
h(x,x') =
- (x,x') +
- i-d(x,x?

144
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
The picture on the cover is obtained by taking a = 1, c = To and d = to. The
initial point of the orbit is ((
to),
0)).
The orbit in this case lies on a pair
invariant tori in the phase space; the picture is a projection onto the (Xl, yt}-plane.
The class of period-q points in Table 8.1 with Zq-symmetry are associated with
the conical pendulum solutions. They are essentially discrete analogs of the 80(2)
class of periodic solutions of the unforced problem. When the energy and momentum
take the required values and the forcing frequency is in some sense rationally related
to the conical pendulum frequency the result is the Zq-orbits.
8.5 Reduction to the orbit space
When the map has a continuous symmetry (Lie group of dimension greater
than zero) the flow transverse to the group orbit can be studied using orbit space
reduction (Bridges & Cushman [1993, Section 5]). In this section orbit space reduc-
tion is applied to 0(2)-equivariant symplectic maps (the technique applies equally
well to equivariant maps with higher dimensional, but compact, symmetry group).
0(2)-equivariant maps have an invariant (see Proposition 8.11) and can therefore
be reduced to a map on a space of lower dimension. In order to include the sin-
gular case we reduce the symplectic map on R4 to a Poisson map on R3
- with a
Casimir invariant (the fundamental concepts and definitions are available in Bridges
& Cushman [1993] and Bridges, Cushman & MacKay [1993]).
First we sketch the reduction using the generating function (8.16) with a po-
tential and then state the general reduction result for 0(2)-equivariant maps.
The generating function (8.16) with the higher-order terms in the form of a
potential is
hex,x', A) = ta(..\)(x, x) - (x, x') + tC(..\)(x', x') + tV( (x, x), A)
(8.28)
with a, c : R -> R and V a smooth potential satisfying V(O, A) = V'(O, A) = 0
(where the prime indicates differentiation with respect to the first argument). The
0(2)-equivariant symplectic map generated by (8.28) is
x' = [a(..\) + V'(O"I,A)] x + y,
y' = [a(..\)c(..\) + c(..\)V'(uI' A) - 1]x + c(..\) y.
(8.29)
To reduce (8.29) to the orbit space introduce coordinates (the Hilbert basis for the
80(2)-invariant functions):
O"I=(X,X),
0"2=(y,y),
0"3=(X,y),
0"4=(y,JX).

not depend explicitly on 0"2 and 0"3. We verify in the following result that P is a
Poisson map. In fact we prove the more general result that any 0(2)-equivariant
symplectic map on R4 can be reduced to a Poisson map on R3 with
(8.32)
as a Casimir invariant for the Poisson structure.
Theorem 8.14. Let T : (x,y,A) >--> (x',y',A) be a A-parametrized smooth family
of 0(2)-equivariant symplectic maps on R4 with the standard symplectic action of
80(2) C 0(2). Let 0" = (0"1,0"2,0"3) be as defined in (8.90).
Then T expressed in
terms of the a-coordinates is a (family of) Poisson maps with respect to the Poisson
bracket
{f,g} = ('V1/;, 'Vf x 'Vg)
(8.33)
where i.s E c oo (R3,R) and x is the usual cross-product on R3 • Moreover 1jJ(0") in
(8.92) is a Casimir invariant for the Poisson structu1'e.
Proof. The proof of reduction for the general 0(2)-equivariant symplectic map
(using only the 80(2) C 0(2)) follows from Theorem 5.4 in Bridges & Cushman
[1993]. Taking the pullback of the standard Poisson bracket on R4 under the Hilbert
map (x, y) >--> (0") results in the bracket (8.33). The fact that 1jJ(0") is a Casimir (that

146
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
is, {'l/J, f} = 0 for all smooth f) follows from the definition (8.33) and the properties
of the vector cross product.
•
Positive values of the Casimir function, 'l/J( (T) = 12 , result in a family of smooth
2-manifolds, hyperboloids of a single sheet (d. Figure 8.5). The foliation is sym-
plectic and each leaf is an invariant set for orbits of the Poisson map P. In other
words, when 1 =I- 0, the map can be reduced to a symplectic map on the reduced
2-manifold (which can be flattened and with a suitable change of coordinates it be-
comes an area-preserving map with respect to the standard area form). When 1 = 0
the level set of the Casimir function degenerates to a half-cone with a singularity at
the origin.
Fixed points of the reduced map lift, via reconstruction, to invariant circles,
with flow along the group orbit, in the original 4D-map. Note that in general the
reduced map is not integrable and will therefore contain all the dynamics expected
of a non-integrable area-preserving map, but, in addition the flow along the 80(2)-
group orbit will be governed by the complex dynamics on the reduced space.
8.6 Remarks on linear stability for equivariant maps
The linear stability question for periodic points (or more general orbits) of
equivariant maps has interesting features forced by the symmetry. In this section
we sketch, using an 0(2)-equivariant map as an example, the linear stability analysis
for orbits confined to a fixed point subspace in phase space. For example we use the
0(2)-equivariant map (8.29). Suppressing the parameter dependence the map is
x' = ax + y + V'((x,x))x
y' = -x + ex'
(8.34)
(8.35)
with a E R and V a smooth potential satisfying V(O) = V'(O) = O.
Choose an orbit on the fixed point space ('" x, '"y) = (x, y) implying
X2 =
Y2 = O. Note that such an orbit satisfies zero angular momentum (that is 1 = 0).
Restriction of the map (8.34) to Fix", results in
= aXI + fh + V'(Xi)XI,
x + X and y
Now linearize about the orbit in Fix", taking x
x= (XI,O) and y= (fh,O),
x' = aX + Y + VI (xi) X + 2xi VI/(xi)XI
yl=-X+eX'.
Y + Y with

Y{ = -Xl +
and
147
(8.36)
(8.37)
= aX2 + Y2 + V'(xi) X 2 ,
Y; = -X2 +
The first set (8.36) is the linear stability problem restricted to Fix 11:; that is linea-
rization of the area-preserving map (8.35). When (xI,fh) is a point on a periodic
orbit, the linear stability problem is straightforward (for bifurcating period-q points
Stability Lemma I applies for example). (8.37) are the normal variational equations
that determine linear stability normal to the fixed point space. Note that (8.37) has
an exact orbit given by taking X 2 = Xl (in which case (8.37) reduces to (8.35».
This solution is the tangent vector to the group orbi.t of solutions of (8.34) (the
group orbit is obtained by acting on (xI,O,ih,O) with 80(2) C 0(2».
There are two types of "instabilities" here; instability within the fixed point
subspace and bifurcation into the group orbit when the angular momentum invariant
is perturbed away from zero. It seems that a complete theory for these instabilities
and group orbit bifurcations is tractable when the flow in the fixed point subspace
is periodic. However it would be interesting to understand the problem when the
orbit in Fix II: is ergodic, an invariant circle or other complex orbit and the angular
momentum is perturbed away from zero (that is how to characterize the flow along
the group orbit in this case).

9. Collision of multipliers
at rational points for symplectic maps
Let T : (x, y, >., a) f-+ (x', y') be a family of symplectic maps on R4 parametrized
by (>.,a) E R2 •
Suppose that the linear map DTo E Sp(4,R) has eigenvalues
e±ilJ each of multiplicity two and furthermore that the map DTO has a non-trivial
nilpotent part. It is shown in Appendix D that there exists a transformation § E
Sp(4, R) such that §-1 DTo§ = Mo where Mo is in Williamson normal form,
Re)
Re
(9.1)
with R e = coseI +sin eJ, e = 21rfJ with fJ E (0, !) and e = ±1 is the sign-invariant
of the collision (cf. (D.2)).
Consider the nonlinear symplectic map (transform of T by 8)
where the dots refer to terms of higher order in (x, y) and (>., a).
It is natural in this context to study the dynamics in the neighborhood of the
origin by normalizing the nonlinear map. The normalized map is presumably simpler
and the dynamics can be completely analyzed (hopefully) and then one studies the
persistence of the dynamics in the untransformed map.
For the case when e= 21rfJ and P is irrational this approach is used in Bridges
& Cushman [1993, Section 4] and Bridges, Cushman & MacKay [1993] to study
the dynamics near the irrational collision. The analysis of the normal form is con-
siderably simplified by the fact that the normal-form transformations impose an
additional 51-symmetry resulting in an invariant. Then via reduction the normal
form can be completely analyzed (see remarks in Section 9.7).
When p is rational however the problem is much more difficult (resonances!).
It is still possible to obtain the normal form (in principle) but the construction
involves exponentiation of more complicated vectorfields (the resonances producing
additional terms). A bigger difficulty however is that the normal form symmetry is
discrete (Zq when p = p/q) and therefore there is no invariant of the normalized
map. On the one hand this implies that resonant collisions will have much more
complicated local dynamics and on the other hand it is much harder to analyze.
A complete analysis of periodic points in the unfolding of the rational collision
will go a long way towards constructing the backbone of the local dynamics in the

150

(9.2)
phase space.
In this chapter we will find that a complete analysis of bifurcating
period-q points in the unfolding of a rational collision can be obtained with elegant
simplicity using our framework - Splitting Lemma and singularity theory. It turns
out that the rational collision shows up in the normal form for bifurcating period-
q points as a parameter singularity and so fits neatly into the singularity theory
framework.
An important point is that the collision of rational multipliers does not raise the
dimension of the kernel of LO. This can be seen by considering the linear symplectic
map

Period-q points of the linear map (9.2) lie in

An additional feature of our analysis is that some surprising linear instability
results for the bifurcating period-q points are obtained. We find that - dependent
on particular coefficients in the bifurcation equation - the unfolding of the ratio-
nal collision has a globally connected branch of period-q points. Along the global
branches there is always a secondary small-angle collision of multipliers.
9.1 Generic theory for the nonlinear rational collision
Before proceeding to an analysis of the nonlinear problem we first construct a
two-parameter versal unfolding for M o in Sp(4, R).

9. RATIONAL COLLISION OF MULTIPLIERS
151
Proposition 9.1. Let M E Sp(4, R) an.d suppose a(M)
=;: {e±iZ71'p} each of alge-
braic multiplicity two and geometric multiplicity one and p E Q n (0,
Then the
normal form M o for M is given by (9.1), it is of codimension two in Sp(4, R) and
moreover a miniversal two­parameter unfolding of M o in Sp(4, R) is
M(A,a)
=;: [(l+W)Ro+,\
aRo+'\
(9.4)
Proof. The fact that M o is the normal form under the conditions stated is proved in
Appendix D by constructing the necessary symplectic transformation. It is difficult
to give a proof of the unfolding working in Sp(4, R). The idea is to take the logarithm
of M o and work in the Lie algebra sp(4, R) where
In particular note that
M o =;: exp N
with
N = (Bg
E sp(4, R)
where AD is the Hamiltonian matrix associated with the collision of purely imaginary
eigenvalues (Bridges [1990, p.576-7]). A short calculation, using Arnold's theory for
versal deformations of matrices (Arnold [1988, p.238]), shows that a spanning set
for the normal space of the orbit of AO in sp( 4, R) is given by {AI, A z} where
(9.5)
Given an arbitrary two-parameter unfolding A(..\, a) of AD, the condition for
A(A, a) to be a versal unfolding is that

Clearly a satisfactory unfolding of AO is given by A(A,a) = AD + AAI + aAz.
But, although A(A, a) provides a nice unfolding in the Lie algebra, exponentiation
of A(A, a) results in a messy unfolding of M o in Sp(4, R). On the other hand the
logarithm of M( A, a) in (9.4) results in a messy function of a in the Lie algebra.
But it is M(A, a) in (9.4) that we use because of its elegant simplicity and therefore
all we have to show is that the logarithm satisfies the transversality condition (9.6).

Substitution of (9.8) and (9.9) into (9.6) shows that the 2 x 2 matrix in (9.6) is

Translation of the linear map M( A. a) into the A,B, C matrices of the genera-
ting function h(x,xl,A) corresponds to
A = (e + 0')1,
B = eRr+>-.
and
C =

resulting in the following expression for the quadratic part of the generating function
(9.10)
As previously we consider generating functions whose higher order terms (third order
or more) might also depend on A and a.
We denote them by fleX, Xl, A,a).
One
could also consider h depending on additional perturbation parameters f3 to study
degenerate collisions and their perturbations (ef.

If w < 0 the multipliers lie at
in particular, the multipliers lie on the unit circle as shown in Figure 9.1(a). When
a = 0 the multipliers coalesce and there is a double (nonsemisimple) multiplier at

a(M) = {e-f3±i(9+,x), ef3±i(II+,x)}
where
{3 = 2 sinh-1

In particular they lie on circles of radii e- f3 and ef3 as shown in Figure 9.1(c). The
parameter a is associated with the direction normal to the unit circle while the

154
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
parameter .\ is associated with the tangent space of the unit circle. This completes
the analysis of the linear problem.
For analysis of the nonlinear problem near a rational collision we assume hence-
forth that the multiplier collision takes place at a rational point: () = 7Jr with p, q
in lowest terms and q
3. For the nonlinear problem we use the action formulation.
The action functional restricted to the space
is
Wq(x,.\,a) =
L(.\,a)x) + N(x,.\,a)
where N(x,.\,a) = 2::J=1 h(xj , x j +1, .\,a ),
L(.\, a) = I q I2i (2E+ a)1 ­ Er, I2i Rf+oX ­ Ef{ ® Ro+oX

La = r, I2i I
LoX = ­Efq ® (Rf+oX ­ Rn ­ Ef{ ® (Ro+oX ­ R»).
Or alternatively LoX can be cast into the more useful form
(9.11)
(9.12)
Proposition 9.2. Let U be as defined above with () = 'h!.Jr and E = ±1. Its spectrum
q
(including multiplicities) is given by
1 '5:j <«.
(9.14)
In particular, zero is an eigenvalue of multiplicity two (j = q ­ p + 1 and j = p + 1)
and the nullspace is spanned by {(I,

Moreover the spectrum is non-negative and lies in the interval [0,4] when E = +1
(respectively non-positive and lies in [­4,0] when E = ­1) and the endpoint 4E E
a(LO) only when q is even.

The point 4f is in the spectrum when 2(p ± j =f 1) = q which is satisfied for
integer j only when q is even.
•
The basic result on the effect of the rational collision on the bifurcation of
period-q points can now be stated.
Theorem 9.3 (Rational Collision Theorem). Suppose T is a two-parameter
smooth family of symplectic maps on R4 generated by h with quadratic part in general
position for a collision of multipliers at a rational point on the unit circle. Then the
bifurcating period-q points are in one-to-one correspondence with critical points of a
Zq-invariant functional on R2 given by
Wq(X, A,a) = F(u, v, A, 0') + W G(u, v, A,a)
with F(O,0, A, a) = F,.0 = F:J... = 0,

Remark.
Note that tt, v, and w form a basis for the Zq invariants on R2 (see
Proposition 2.6). It is important to note that the normal form for the bifurcating
period-q points at a rational collision is identical to that obtained for the generic
bifurcation of period-q points in symplectic maps. In particular the period-q points
still lie on a two-dimensional subspace clue to the presence of a nontrivial nilpotent
part in the Jordan normal form. The collision of multipliers manifests itself simply

156
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
as the singularity F'::" = O!
Therefore the rational collision fits neatly into the
singularity theory framework developed for Zq-equivariant gradient maps on R2 •
Proof. The Splitting Lemma is applied to the action functional W q in (9.11). First
note that in spite of the fact that there are two multipliers (and their conjugates)
at the rational point the nullspace of LOremains 2-dimensional (Proposition 9.2).
Note also that VxW; = 0 and Hess., W; = LO with Ker L" = span{6,6} and
that Wq is a Zq-invariant functional with Zq = (fq @ I). Then with
= A EB B,
A =
6}, all the hypotheses ofthe Equivariant Splitting Lemma (Appendix
A) have been satisfied. Therefore
Since Wq is Zq-invariant with respect to the standard action of Zq on R2 it follows
that (see Chapter 2)
Wq(X' A,a) = F(u, v, A, a) + w G(u, v, A, a),
with FO = F,.0 = O. The fact that F$ = 0 is a consequence of Proposition 2.11 but
it will also be a by-product of the present construction.
The quadratic part of the functional Wq is given by
Therefore, with x = x16 + x26 + T and La = I q @ I,

(9.19)
The result F'::' =

Taking the gradient of Wq using (9.16) and (9.17), and changing to the complex
notation z = Xl + iX2, results in the following Taylor series expansion
The normal forms in (9.18) are then obtained by application of the singularity theory
for Zq-equivariant gradient bifurcation maps (cf. Corollary 4.4 in Chapter 4).

As an application of Theorem 9.3 we study the rational collision for the class
of maps generated by

9.2 Collision at third root of unity: B= 27l"/3
Taking q = 3, expanding the reduced functional W3 , in equation (9.16), and
differentiating, results in the following pre-normal form for a collision of multipliers

to be (fA2 + a)u and
N(x, A,a) = V(x l , A,a) +V(x 2 , A,a) +V(x 3 , A,a)
where xi, 1 :s:: j
:s:: 3, are the components of x. Since only Xl and X2 contribute to
the leading order nonlinear term in the normal form we can evaluate N(x, 0, 0) by
taking x = xl6 + x26. A straightforward calculation shows that
N(XI6+X26,0,0)= J3[(a-c)v+(d-b)w]

with v + iw = (Xl + iX2)3. Therefore the coefficient a + ib in the normal form (9.21)
is found to be
a+ib= iJ3[(c-a)+i(d-b)].
Therefore, supposing that a

period-S points in the neighborhood of the collision is (fA2 + a) z +z2.

In Figure 9.2, when a < 0 the intersection points of the branch with the A-
axis correspond to the two generic bifurcation points of period-3 solution branches
which coalesce at a = 0 and detach from the origin (as is essential since the origin is
linearly unstable). However it is not surprising that the bifurcating period-3 points
are all unstable. This is demonstrated as follows.
The normal form g(z,'\, a) = ( ,\2 + a) z +z2 can be written as

When the sign of the determinant of \7zg is negative the period-4 points are linearly
unstable (Instability Lemma). When the sign of \7zg is positive additional work is
necessary to prove linear stability and this analysis is in Section 9.6. The interesting
case is when a < 0 and m E (1,00) when both branches of period-4 points form (a
group orbit of) globally connected branches (global "loops"). One family of global
loops is unstable and the other branch is initially stable but loses stability at finite
amplitude through a .secondary (group orbit of) .small-angle collisumis] (a blow-up
of this bifurcation diagram is shown in Figure 9.4).

The loss of stability along a global loop is reminiscent of what happens in
Hamiltonian vectorfields in the unfolding of the collision of pure imaginary eigen-
values (see Bridges [1991, Figure 2]). However in the map case the loss of stability
is much more dramatic, involving the loss of stability of a group orbit of periodic
points and the bifurcation of tori.
The secondary collision indicates an "upstream" effect (in parameter space) of
the basic a = 0 instability of the trivial state.
Figure 9.5 shows the (.\, a)-space
(taking without loss of generality E = +1 in the figure). Figure 9.5 shows that curve
of bifurcation points (to period-4 points) projected onto the (.\, a) plane (that is
the curve .\2 + W = 0). The (group orbit of) globalloop(s) is a surface above the
parabola .\2 + w = O. The surface of period-4 points loses stability upon passing
into the inner parabola associated with the secondary collision.
In other words
the period-l collision effects the bifurcating period-4 points, when a < 0, at finite
amplitude. A study of the small-angle collision in reversible maps is given by Bhowal
et al. [1993].

lisioii 8ingularity; that is, the bifurcation parameter ,\ appears quadratically and
the unfolding parameter a is necessary for a complete characterization of the local

collision as in the period-4 case (Figures 9.3 and 9.4).
9.5 Reduced instability for the bifurcating period-q points
The idea of reduced stability for the bifurcating period-q points at a rational
collision is to obtain complete information on the linear stability of the period-q
points from the reduced functional W g in normal form. In this section we will give
a complete characterization of the problem and prove a reduced instability result.
Proposition 9.4. Let H be the reduced functional in normal form governing the
bifurcation of period-q points and suppose that for a nontrivial solution (X, A, a) of
the reduced bifurcation equations with (1Ixll, IAI, lal) sufficiently small
IHessxH(x,,\, a)1 < 0,
then the bifurcating period-q points are linearly unstable.
(9.29)
Proof.
Since the determinant of HessxH is an invariant of Zg-equivalence the
condition (9.29) is equivalent to [Hess, VVq(X, A, a)1 < O. This lemma is now an easy
consequence of the Instability Lemma of Appendix M. A calculation shows that
[Hess, m(O, A)I > 0 as both eigenvalues are identical and so we can conclude.
•
To prepare the deeper discussion on the stability of the next section we now
examine more carefully all the conditions involved, not only in the instability results
but also those which can contribute positively to the stability of the period-q points.
Take an period-q orbit x = {xi} C X; of the symplectic map generated by h.

6.B > 0, TB > 0 and T1 - 46. B > o.
The relation between the residues and the parameters (TB, 6.B) is

When a Floquet multiplier lies at 1, p = 2 and R = O.
At the bifurcation point
(A = a = 0) both R] and R 2 will be zero; that is, all four Floquet multipliers of
the period-q points will be at 1. However, in the unfolding of the codimension-2
point there are 4 possibilities for the configuration of the Floquet multipliers and
there is only one stable configuration. Note that a necessary condition for stability
is 6. B > 0 and conversely if 6. B < 0 the period-q points are unstable (Proposition
9.4).
A complete reduced stability result requires establishment of a relation between
the reduced functional Wq and the invariant TB in (9.30). For q = 3 the sign of TB
is not needed as the bifurcating period-3 points are unstable. For the case q = 4 the
sign of TB is studied in the next subsection.

9.6 Reduced stability for bifurcating period-4 points
In this section we consider the case when q = 4 and f:!..B (equivalently the sign
of [Hess; W4 1) is positive along the branch and determine sufficient conditions under
which the branch is stable. To determine the sign of TB we proceed as follows.

as follows,

in Section 9.3. The simplest result is the sufficient condition for linear instability
associated with f:!..B < 0 (Proposition 9.4). For TB we proceed as follows.
First, a direct calculation verifies

The idea is to evaluate the matrices A j and B j , 1 ::; j ::; 4, at a period-4 point
and substitute into (9.34)-(9.35). This is straightforward but lengthy. For simplicity
we will give the result for the class of maps studied in Section 9.3. First we note
that
A, =(2f+0')I-VI-V2
A 2 = (2f + 0')I - VI - V 2
A 3 = (2f + 0')I +VI - V 2
A 4 = (2f + 0')1 + VI - V 2

the class of maps generated by h as in (9.20a), take the following form
F = -if! + fAJ +...
E = 4(e.\2 + 0')1+ 2 (JV2J - V 2) + e(JVp - Vi) + ....

Then the governing equations for the first class (defined by X2 = 0 in Table 9.1) are
in Fix Zf and the second class are in Fix Z2. Note that these symmetries are normal
form symmetries and only hold locally in phase space (do not persist to all orders in
the bifurcation equations). However they are convenient labels for the branches of
period-4 points and we will identify the two branches by their normal-form isotropy
subgroup If or 12. We now verify the stability assignments in Figures 9.3 and 9.4.
Without loss of generality take E= +1 (E = -1 results in a trivial permutation of
the bifurcation diagrams with no qualitative change).
Along the Z2-branch we find that

We now ve-
rify that the Z2-branch is indeed linearly stable when Em < o.
The invariant TB
evaluated on the Z2-branch is
TB = 64(),2 - 2E(m - 1) N + ... ) ,
where N is u scaled (multiplied) by In31. Since E= + 1 and Em < 0 it follows that
TB > 0 for (1),1, [o],u) sufficiently small. It remains to check the Krein locus,
J{B =

which is clearly positive when Em < 0 and E= +1 and (u, 1),1, laj) are sufficiently
small. Therefore the Z2-branch, when Em < 0 and E= +1, is in the stable region of
the (TB,

For the Zf-branch we noted that when on < Eit is unstable. When Em > 1 we
find that the stability coefficients are

9.7 Remarks on the collision at irrational points
Some idea of the basic structure of the bifurcation that takes place in the
neighborhood of an irrational collision of multipliers of opposite signature can be
obtained from the structure of a rational collision when q is large. Although only
one parameter is essential for a collision of multipliers at an irrational point our
claim is that a two-parameter analysis provides a clearer picture of that structure.

172
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
Recall that the linear symplectic map on R4 in general position for a collision
of multipliers is
(9.38)
for which we have the following result.
Proposition 9.8. Let T be the two parameter family of linear symplectic map on
R4 given by (9.38).
Then for all (..\,0') E R2 there exists two independent integrals
I(x,y) = (y,Jx)
E(x,y) = (y,y) + O'(x,y) - w(x,x).
When (..\,0') = 0 and 8 E (0, 7r) is at an irrational point, the only bounded orbit of
the map is an invariant circle lying in the x-plane (y = 0).
Proof. The integral I follows from the SO(2)-invariance of the generating function
h for T; h is given in (9.10) and for SO(2) = (R.p ) it is clear that h(R.p x, R.p x') =
h(x, x'). The conservation of I then follows from Theorem E in Appendix E. That
E is a second integral can be verified by direct calculation.
When ..\ = 0' = 0 the linear map (9.38) reduces to
x j+ 1 = R, x j + ERo yj
yj+l = R o yj
and the orbit of (xO, yO) can be explicitly calculated to be
.
°
°
xl = Rjo (x + EjY )
yj = R jo yO.
If y = 0 the orbit is an invariant circle in the x-plane of rotation number p = 8j27r.
But the invariant circle is algebraically unstable; that is any initial condition with
lIyll f= 0 lies in the cylinder Ilyj II = constant but leaves the x-plane algebraically:
that is Ilxjll
j as j -+ 00.
•
The primary structure of an irrational collision is a simple - algebraically un-
stable - invariant circle lying in a 2-dimensional subspace of the four-dimensional
phase space. Therefore the primary question is the persistence or non-persistence of
the invariant circle in the unfolding - including nonlinear effects - of the singularity
associated with the collision. With a two-parameter analysis the rotation number
of the invariant circle can be frozen at the collision value, say p, and then the idea

9. RATIONAL COLLISION OF MULTIPLIERS
173
is to look for curves, in two-dimensional parameter space, along which the invariant
circle of rotation number p exists.
In such a framework it is roughly clear what is the behavior under perturbation
of the invariant circle of rotation number p.
The bifurcation picture is expected
to be similar to that shown in Figure 9.6 for q large. Depending on the sign of a
particular coefficient (cl = ±1) either there exists a global loop (C] = +1) along
which an invariant circle of rotation number p exists for each w, < 0 sufficiently
small which vanishes for 0' = 0 or if er = -1 there is no global loop but a curve of
invariant circles (in (X,.\) space) that persists after the collision (EO' > 0).
Another approach to studying the irrational collision is to work directly with
the symplectic map, apply normal form transformations and analyze the normalized
map (Bridges & Cushman [1993, Section 4], Bridges, Cushman & MacKay [1993]).
This approach turns out to be particularly successful for the irrational collision
because the normal form transformations introduce an 51-symmetry which simplifies
the analysis of the normal form.
Using unipotent normalization the nonlinear normal form for the irrational
collision is
(9.39)
with
1; = lit = .\ + bzal + b31 + ...
hI = h U I = 0' + blal + bzI + ..,
where a] = (x,x) 1= (y,Jx) and h is a smooth function of a], I and parameters
(Bridges & Cushman [1993, equation (4.7)). Note that the normal form is written
down to "infinite order" but it is a formal expression and not, in general, convergent
(that is, the normal form is obtained by repeated formal power series symplectic
transformations).
The map (9.39) is analyzed by reducing to the orbit space. Introduce coordi-
nates a = (al,az,a3) (as in (8.30)). In terms of the coordinates a the map (9.39)
is
a' = M(aI, 1) a
with
M( aI, 1) = (
<ah.,
1
1
2w
)
-zi,
1 - 2ch]
(9.40)
where a = 1- eh.«.
The map (9.40) is a Poisson map (with respect to the Poisson bracket (8.33))
and the Poisson structure has the Casimir 1/;(a) defined in (8.32). When I -I- 0 the
map (9.40) can be reduced to an area-preserving map. Let

174
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
Then (9.40) reduces to
u' = a2u + 2wu + t(I2 + v2),
v' = -ahuu + (1 - 2Ehu) v + Et(I2 + v2),
(9.41 )
where It depends on u, v, I and parameters.
The symplectic form for (9.41) is w = 21udu 1\dv but can be flattened by taking
w = d(1nyU) 1\ dv. In other words the analysis of the dynamics near an irrational
collision when I -I- 0 can be reduced to the study of an interesting 2-parameter (0',I)
family of area-preserving maps (9.41).
Fixed points of the area-preserving map (9.41) lift to invariant circles in the 4D-
map with flow along the 51-group orbit (note that the 51-symmetry is a normal form
symmetry here and is therefore not exact; persistence of the invariant circles in the
original map is a separate question). This is a sketch of the analysis using normal
form theory.
Additional details of the local analysis of the phase space geometry
near an irrational collision are given by Bridges, Cushman & MacKay [1993].

10. Equivariant maps and the collision of multipliers
The effect of symmetry on the collision of multipliers is twofold. If there is
"too much" symmetry, the collision is prevented; this happens for example in 0(2)-
equivariant maps when the group acts absolutely irreducibly on the configuration
space.
On the other hand when a collision of multipliers of opposite signature
occurs in an equivariant map there is additional interesting structure in the phase
space and bifurcations. In this section, the collision of multipliers in 4D-equivariant
symplectic maps is considered with particular attention to symmetries that do not
eliminate the collision.
A general study of the effect of symmetry on the collision
in equivariant maps of arbitrary dimension and general compact Lie group actions
would be of great interest but is not considered here (see van der Meer [1990] and
Dellnitz et al, [1992] for analogous studies of Hamiltonian vectorfields).
We consider first the case of reversible-symplectic maps and show that the bifur-
cation is roughly the same as the non-reversible case but there are two new features
to account for. The reduced functional for a reversible collision has an additional
but the generic normal form is equivalent to the non-reversible case
(modulo some signs). The other feature of interest in the reversible case is the extra
symmetry in the sequences; the bifurcating period-q points lie in subsequences of
with additional temporal symmetry.
For 4D-maps the largest group of spatial symmetries is 0(2), assuming the
group is a compact Lie group that acts independent of discrete time on the confi-
guration space and lifts to a diagonal action on the phase space. It turns out that,
for reversible-symplectic maps, any spatial-symmetry group larger than Z2 will pre-
vent a collision.
Therefore, interesting effects of symmetry on a collision, in the
reversible-symplectic case, will require a higher dimensional configuration space.
In the absence of reversibility, however, symplectic maps on R4 admit more
interesting configuration space symmetries in the presence of a collision.
The group 0(2) and the dihedral subgroups Dm, m
3, act absolutely irre-
ducibly on R2, and lift to a diagonal symplectic action on R4, in which case - as
shown in Chapter 8 - the multipliers are double and of the same signature (that is
there are no collision possible). However we show that every subgroup of 0(2) that
does not act absolutely irreducibly, in particular, SO(2), Zm, m

are admissible spatial symmetries.
The groups Z2 and Z2X Z2 reduce the problem essentially to a reversible collision.
The interesting spatial symmetries are Zm, m
3, and SO(2).
The analysis for
Zm and 80(2) is similar but 80(2) has the most dramatic effect on the collision
of multipliers because of the presence of a continuous symmetry. The collision is

not eliminated but the bifurcating periodic points near the collision ride on the
SO(2)-group orbit.
10.1 Reversible-symplectic maps on R4
Let R = I\, 0 1 be the standard reversor on R4 . A matrix M E GI(4, R) is said
to be reversible if RMR = M-1 . The subgroup of symplectic matrices that is also
reversible, denoted by SP'R(4, R), is composed of elements of the form
where M 2 and M 3 are 2 x 2 symmetric matrices, M 1 is a general 2 x 2 matrix and
To see this note that M E Sp(4, R) requires JTMTJ = M-l which when combined
with RMR = M-l requires M T = -JRMRJ.
We now consider the collision of multipliers in reversible-symplectic maps. Sup-
pose T : (x,y)
f-+ (x',y') is a reversible-symplectic map on R4 and that u(DT) =
{e±ill}, 0 E (0,71') with each multiplier of algebraic multiplicity two and geometric
multiplicity one. Without loss of generality we can suppose that DTo is in normal
form for a collision. The linear normal form
M o =
0RII
for
0 E (0,71'),
(cf. (9.1) in Chapter 9) is in fact already reversible-symplectic, but with respect to
the involution
-;).
In other words fi2 = 14and fiMofi = M;;-l. The reversor R is also antisymplectic:
fiT J4fi = -J4 · A change of basis can be introduced so that M o is reversible with
respect to the standard reversor.
Introduce the following elementary (symplectic) permutation

and Mo satisfies MaRMoR = 14 •
With B E (0,11") and e = ±1, Mo is the li-
near normal form for a collision of multipliers in reversible­symplectic maps. It is
codimension­2 in SPR.(4, R) when the multiplier lies at a rational point on the unit
circle.
Proposition 10.1. The versal unfolding of Mo in SpR.(4, R) is given by

(10.2)
where 8= B+ A.
Proof. Same as proof of Proposition 9.1 but with SPR.(4,R) instead of Sp(4,R).•
The characteristic polynomial for M('\,a) is (modulo a simple scaling) exactly
as in Section 9.1 (see Figure 9.1).
An argument modeled on Proposition 2.1 shows that any reversible­symplectic
map, in the neighborhood of a collision has a generating function
h(x, x') =
Ax) ­ (x, Bx') +
ex') + h(x, x', A, a),
and the reversibility requires that A = e and B T = B. Let

.
Then when h is of the form (lOA) with A, B and e given by (10.5), the generating
function is in general position for a collision of multipliers at rational points.
The bifurcation of period­q points in the neighborhood of a rational collision
is essentially the same as the non­reversible case. Therefore we will just sketch the
results. The differences being that the reduced functional is Oq­invariant rather than
Zq­invariant and the sequence of periodic points have nontrivial isotropy subgroups.
The normal form for the bifurcating period­q points will be a Dq­equivariant gradient
map on R2 with the "collision singularity"; that is, A will appear quadratically in
the normal form.

178
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
Let () = 771' with p, q in lowest terms and q
3. The action functional, with h
in general position for a collision, on the space
is
Wq(x,'x,a) = t(x, L('x,a)x) +N(x,'x,a)
where N(x

(10.8)
Therefore write

as x = x16 + x26 + T.
Then application of the Splitting Lemma to Wq results in
(10.9)
The reduced functional Wq is Dq-invariant with respect to the standard action of
Dq on R2 . The reversor K q introduced in Chapter 2, equation (2.21), reduces to K;
that is, with the eigenvectors 6 and 6 given in (10.8),
Therefore it follows from Proposition 2.6 that the reduced functional simplifies to
Wq(x,'x,a) = F(u,v,'x,a),
where u and v are the Dq-invariants on R2 , and from Proposition (2.11) it follows
that
F(u,v,'x,a) = f,X2 u +
+
+ FtZxau +...
and a straightforward calculation using (10.8) shows that
= 1.
In the 2-parameter family ('x,a) we can assume that F':' and
take generic
values. Therefore as a corollary to Theorem 9.3, the normal forms for the rational
collisions q = 3,4 ... are as given in Section 6.2.
Note that the only difference
between the normal forms for the reversible and non-reversible rational collisions is
the additional signs in the reversible case. The Dq equivariant changes of coordinates
are not sufficient to eliminate the signs, but the signs result in only trivial changes
in the bifurcation diagrams. In particular the bifurcation diagrams are similar to

and
those shown in Figures 9.2 to 9.6. The collision of multipliers at ±i in reversible-
symplectic maps is treated in more detail in Bridges, Furter & Lahiri [1991].
10.2 Symplectic maps on R4 with spatial symmetry
When a symplectic map on R4 is not reversible the class of admissible configura-
tion space symmetries that does not eliminate the collision is larger. Any subgroup
of 0(2) that does not act absolutely irreducibly is an admissible spatial symmetry.
This eliminates 0(2) and Om, m
3, but allows for
= SO(2), 1m , m
2, and
1 2 X 1 2 . The collision with 1 2 or 1 2 X 12-symmetry will be similar to the reversible
collision. We will treat the collision with SO(2)-symmetry in detail as it contains
the most interesting features. The analysis is similar for the case
= 1m , m
3.
Let T : (x, y)
f-+ (x', y/) be a symplectic map on R4 equivariant with respect
to SO(2).
Such maps are quite prevalent in applications.
An elementary exam-
ple that gives rise to an SO(2)-equivariant symplectic map is the time-T map of
a parametrically-forced Lagrange top (when the forcing does not break the SO(2)-
spatial symmetry). We can assume without loss of generality that, in the neigh-
borhood of a collision, the SO(2)-equivariant symplectic map has a Lagrangian
generating function h(x, x') with
h(R", x,R", x') = h(x,x/)
where R", =
cos e I + sin e J for ¢> E R/21r1.
The ring of SO(2)-invariants on
R4 = (x, x') is generated by (x, x), (x', x'), (x, x') and (x, Jx/) (see Proposition 8.8).
Therefore with B = bII +
an SO(2)-invariant generating function takes the
form
h(x, x') =
(x, x )-(x,
(x', x')+h((x, z}, (x', x'), (x, x'), (x, Jx'»). (10.9)
where a and c are real numbers. For non-degeneracy we require (twist condition)
that
+
=I- O. Note however that if b2 = 0 the quadratic part of the generating
function is 0(2)-invariant and a collision is not possible. Hence a necessary condition
for a collision is bz =1= O.
Proposition 10.2.
Let T : (x, y)
f-+ (x', y/) be an SO(2)-equivariant symplectic
map generated by h as in (10.9) and suppose b2 =I- O. Then a collision of multipliers
of opposite signature occurs when
bI(a +c)
- 1 <
+bD < 1.
Moreover the collision occurs at a rational point when
for
f) =
q

180
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
Proof. The tangent map for the SO(2)-invariant generating function in the neigh-
borhood of a trivial fixed point is
and by Floquet's theorem
=
Therefore the eigenvalue problem for p, is
((a +c)I - p,B -
= 0
with characteristic equation for p = p,+ p,-1,
6.(p) = (bi +
- 2b1(a + c)p -
+ (a + c? = O.
A collision occurs when 6.(p) =
= 0 or
with
p=cos(}
for
(}E(O,7r),
and substitution into
= 0 requires
which completes the proof and shows the necessity of b2 "I o.
•
Note that a corollary of this result is that O(2)-equivariant maps (which require
b2 = 0) are collision-free. Now suppose the conditions of Proposition 10.2 are met
and linear map DTo has a collision of multipliers at a rational point. There exists a
symplectic SO(2)-equivariant matrix on R4 that transforms DTo into linear normal
form.
This transformation turns out to be particularly easy since the quadratic
part of the generating function in (10.9) is virtually already in normal form. In fact
the normal form for the quadratic part of the generating function, including the
unfolding, given in (9.10) is SO(2)-invariant. Therefore let
U1=(x,x),
U2=(x',x'),
U3=(x,x')
and
U4=(x,Jx')
then in the neighborhood of a collision any SO(2)-invariant generating function h
has the form
h(x,x') = i(
+ a)(x, x) -
(x,Rf+-Xx') +
+ h(U1,U2,U3,U4 ) .
(10.10)
where it. begins with terms of degree 4.
The reduction to a gradient map on R2 follows the usual pattern: construct
the action functional on
and use the equivariant Splitting Lemma. The action
functional on
is
Wq(x,A,a) =
L(A,a)x) +N(x,A,a)

10. SYMMETRY AND MULTIPLIER COLLISION
181
where L(A,o:) will have exactly the same form as that given in (9.12)-(9.13). But
Wq(x, A,0:) has additional symmetry, in particular it is SO(2) x Zq-invariant with
Zq = (rq <2) I) and SO(2) = (Iq <2) Rq,).
Proposition 10.3. Let X = (Xl,:\:2) be coordinates on Ker La. Then the action of
SO(2)xZq on Ker La is generated by 8· X
Re' X with 8 = 77r and <jJ. X
Rq,' X
with <jJ E R/27rZ. Let (8,<jJ)· X represent the combined action ofSO(2)xZq.
Then, up to conjugacy, the only isotropy subgroup with a 2D-fixed point space
is 'i,
(8, -8). Moreover, let NZ q denote the normalizer ofZq in SO(2)xZq, then
WZq = SO(2) (the Weyl subgroup of'i.;
Proof. Let Ker If = span{6,6} with 6 and 6 given in Proposition 9.2. Then
and a similar construction shows that the action of Zq on Ker La reduces to Re.
Now X E R2 and the only subgroup of SO(2) x Zq, up to conjugacy, that fixes all of
R2 is the subgroup generated by ReH with <jJ = -8. Since SO(2) x Zq is abelian
the result WZ q = SO(2) easily follows.
•
Note that, generically, the period-q points ride on the SO(2)-group orbit; that
is an increment of discrete time corresponds to a shift by 8 in the group SO(2). This
will have a dramatic effect on the normal form. The normal form for the bifurcating
period-q points will have the symmetry of WZ q = SO(2). Combining the results of
Theorem 9.3 and Proposition 10.3 we have proved the following.
Theorem 10.4 (SO(2)-symmetric rational collision). Suppose T is an SO(2)-
equivariant symplectic map on R4 generated by a smooth h with quadratic part in
general position for a collision of multipliers at a rational point 8 =
Then there
q
-
exists an SO(2)-orbit of bifurcating period-q points with symmetry group Zq that is
in one-to-one correspondence with critical points of an SO(2)-invariant function on
R2 given by
Wq(X, A,0:) = F(U,A,o:)
with
u = xi +
Moreover F has the Taylor expansion
F(U,A,o:) = ( A2+ to:)u + tF':'u2 + ...
and if F.::, #- 0 then 'VxF is

where h = sign F.::, and
10 = ±1 is the sign-invariant of the collision.
(10.11 )
(10.12)

182
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
Note that the normal form for the bifurcating period-q points is independent
of q. The SO(2)-symmetry essentially reduces the normal form to a Z2-equivariant
gradient map on R. The result in (10.12) then follows from application of the
theory.
The bifurcation diagrams depend on whether 13.8 = ±1 and are shown in
Figure 10.1. Note that each of the branches in Figure 10.1 is in fact a point on an
SO(2)-orbit. For example when eo < a and 13.8 = ±1 there is a bifurcating ellipsoid
foliated by branches of period-q points, and this is true for each q
3.
The period-q points near the collision are "integrable" in the sense that they
ride on the SO(2)-group orbit (although the map is not in general integrable). Recall
also that by Example 1 in Appendix E the SO(2)-equivariant symplectic map has
the conserved quantity I = (y, J x ); that is, every orbit of the symplectic iterated
SO(2)-equivariant map lies on an invariant submanifold.
An example of the collision of multipliers in an SO(2)-equivariant symplectic
map on R4 can be obtained by parametrically forcing T-periodically the Lagrange
top (assuming the forcing does not break the SO(2)-symmetry). The Lagrange top
is integrable but has a collision of eigenvalues of opposite sign (van der Meer [1990]).
Further analysis of the dynamics of SO(2)-equivariant symplectic maps on R4
can be pursued using orbit space reduction.
The reduction is identical to that
presented for 0(2)-equivariant maps in Section 8.5 (indeed it was only the SO(2) C
0(2) that was used in the reduction in Section 8.5). In the non-singular case (I =I- 0)
the map can be reduced to an area-preserving map (as in (9.50) for the irrational
collision normal form). In fact SO(2)-equivariant maps with a collision will have the
same local phase space dynamics on the reduced phase space as the normal form for
the irrational collision (Section 9.7 and Bridges et al. [1993]). However, since the
SO(2)-symmetry is exact in the present case, the map is not near integrable: the
reduced phase space will contain all the complex and interesting dynamics typical
of area-preserving maps - coupled to the flow along the group orbit.

With the exception of the symmetry properties the above result is the well-known
Splitting Lemma or Generalized Morse Lemma. Checking the details of the proof
of Magnus [1977J shows that the diffeomorphism ¢J and the reduced functional Wq
can be chosen to respect the symmetry of Wq .
Appendix B. Signature on configuration space
Given a symplectic map T : (x, y) f-+ (x', y') on R2n , suppose ei B with () E (0, 7r)
is in the spectrum of DTo. Suppose moreover that T is generated by h(x,x'). In
this appendix, an expression for the signature of the multiplier ei B is obtained in

terms of the properties of h; that is, the signature in configuration space. In fact
we prove a more general result: an expression for the signature of a multiplier of a
period-q point.
The idea is roughly as follows.
Suppose x E
is a period-q point of the
symplectic map generated by h; that is,
Let (= (e, ... ,(q) E enq be a sequence in the tangent orbit of {xi} E
with
(i+q = eiBe (for some () E (O,7r) and any j), and let

(7 = signQ
(B.1)
(B.2)
with Q = Im("t, BiC+ I ) for any 1::; i::; q, noting that (q+1 = eiBe.
In other words the signature can be evaluated at any point along the period-q
point orbit. But this is misleading however as the elements in the sequence {CH=I

In terms of the symplectic map T there are several definitions for the signature
in the literature. For example Howard & MacKay [1987, p.1040] use
where
(7 = sign [Re z, J 2nL(q)Re z]
for any
z E Ker (L(q) - eiBI 2n ) ,
(B.5a)
[".J is a real inner product on R2n. Krein's original definition (see Yakubovich &
Starzhinskii [1972, p.159]) is
(7 = sign(i[z,J 2I,z])
for any
z E Ker (L(q) - eiBh,).
(B.6)

APPENDICES

We will use both of these definitions but first we establish that they are equivalent.
Proposition B.1. Let eiO be an eigenvalue of L(q) with 8 E (0,71') and let
z E Ker (L(q) - eiOh,). Then
sign [Re z, J 2n L(q) Re z] = sign (i[z, J 2n z]) .
Proof. By the definition of z: L(q) Re z = Re (eiOz). Therefore
[Re z, J 2I, L(q) Re z] = i [z + z, J 2n ( eiOz + e-iOz)]
=
Re (eiO[z,J 2I,z]) +
Re (eiO[z,J 2I,z])
= Re (ieiO[Re z, J 2I, 1m z])
= - sin8 [Re z , J 2n 1m z] =
sin8 [z, J:a,z].
Since 8 E (0,71'), by hypothesis, sin8 is positive and the result follows.

Of special interest is the signature for a multiplier of a period-1 point of a B-
equivariant map with the compact group B acting diagonally on R2r' . We consider
the real blocks of the isotypic decomposition (8.1), that is, those blocks where B acts
absolutely irreducibly on Wi and the invariant subspace V; is equal to Rn, Q.9R Wi.
From (8.2), the block of DT corresponding to V; is DTi Q.9R Iw,, say
where DTi is generated by hi(x, x') = Hx, Ax) - (x, Bx') + Hx', Cx'), with x , x' E
Rni and lfs] :f.0 (for simplicity we drop the subscript i from A, B and C).
As we have seen in Chapter 8, the multipliers are then of multiplicity dim Wi,
but the fact that the multiplicity is forced by symmetry means that they actually
behave like multipliers of DTi only.
Using the tensor product structure it is clear that we can extend the definitions
of the signature to multipliers in the block of DT corresponding to V; provided
there are single multipliers of DTi.
The element z of the kernel are thus ZI Q.9 WI
with Zl being in the kernel of (DT i -
ei8I2n; ) and WI being any vector in Wi. And
so, the contribution of WI drops from the formulas for the signature as it appears
as IlwIW > O.
And so, we have the following.

APPENDICES

Proposition B.3. In the previous set-up, suppose that ei8, e E (0,7r), is a simple
multiplier in the spectrum of DTi. Let ( E Ker(A + C - ei8B - e-i8B T), then the
signature of the multiplier is
a = sign Q
with
Q = - Im(ei8(e,Be)).
(B.9)
Moreover, if another multiplier collides with e'", its block in the Jordan normal form
of DTi will have non-trivial nilpotent part iff Q = 0; that is,
(B.10)
On the other hand, if Im(ei£l(e,Be)) ::f- 0 at the collision the Jordan normal form
block is diagonal.
Proof.
As we previously mentioned we can discard the contribution of Wi and
concentrate upon DTi and its simple multiplier ei£l
The first part is a consequence of Proposition B.2 for the special case q=l. But
we give a direct proof using (B.4) that will be useful for the second part of the proof.
The signature of ei£l is defined using (B.5a) with DTi = L(1), q = 1 and n = ni.
An element Z E Ker (DTi - ei£lh,,) is given by

Substitution of Re Z into (B.5a) results in (after some algebra and use of the real
and imaginary parts of (B.12))
Reverting back to complex notation, it is immediate that
sign Q = -sign Im(ei8(e,Be))
verifying (B. 9).
If another multiplier collides with ei£l the spectrum of DTi will contain of
ei8 and «:", each with multiplicity two. Their blocks in the Jordan normal form
will have nontrivial nilpotent part if and only if there exists a non-trivial solution

Appendix C. Linear stability on configuration space
In this appendix a correspondence is established between the 2n Floquet mul-
tipliers of a period-q orbit of a symplectic map on R2n and the eigenvalue problem
associated with the Hessian of the action on the Rq x R" dimensional configuration
space. In particular we introduce a transformation that reduces the configuration
space eigenvalue problem on Rnq to a generalized eigenvalue problem on R".
Let {(xi, yi)} ;=1 be a period-q orbit of the symplectic map T : (x, y) f-+ (z", yl)
on R2>' and suppose that T is generated by h. The Jacobian of T evaluated on
the period-q orbit is denoted DT(xi, yi) and the Floquet multipliers of the period-q
orbit are eigenvalues of L(q) where
L(q) = DT(xi+q- l , yi+q-I) 0'"
0 DT(xi, yi),
{xi, yi} E X; x X;.
(C.1)
The matrix L(q) E Sp(2n, R) and the Floquet multipliers satisfy
IL(q) - Jlh,l = p" + alpn-I + ... + an = 0
where
p = Jl + 1.
Il
For each periodic orbit there are n residues - with residue defined by R = :t(2 - p).
When the symplectic map is generated by h, the periodic orbits are obtained as
critical points of the action functional on a space of dimension nq. In this context
it is useful to express the n residues in terms of the Hessian of the action.
The
q-dimensional case - period-q points of area-preserving maps - corresponds to a
result of MacKay & Meiss [1983]. In this appendix we generalize the MacKay-Meiss
result to arbitrary (configuration space) dimension.

polynomial for the Floquet multipliers. The matrix M(Ji) is of order nq and the
idea is to transform it to a generalized eigenvalue problem on Rn!

Appendix F. About reversible symplectic maps
When dealing with twist maps it is tempting to work in configuration space only,
and then to reconstruct the orbits of the map in the phase space. In particular, it
means that one can introduce reversibility in those two contexts, in phase space and
also in configuration space. Then, a natural question is how these two notions of
reversibility are related. The moral of our story is stated in Proposition FA which
shows when and how the two notions of reversibility are identical. In this appendix
we also aim to start a discussion on the relation between reversibility and symplectic
structure. We ignore the parameters.
First, we consider the classical notion of reversibility (in phase space).
We
suppose that l' : R2I' -. R2It is a J-symplectic and
map, that is, 1'-1 =

RTR with R 2 = h, and DTT j DT = j with J skew-symmetric. Note that R
and j need not be constant (nor linear).
Around a R-invariant fixed point of T one can change coordinates and, by
Darboux Theorem, flatten j into the normal form J 2n and so R is transformed into
another involution R with the transformed T of T still being R-reversible.
When R is anti-$ymplectic, that is, DRT J 2n DR = -J2I, , there exists a J 2n -
symplectic change of coordinates such that R =
K Q9 In (Meyer [1981]).
In the
general situation it is not clear whether we can always linearize R.
Nevertheless, at the fixed point, we always have
Proposition f.1.
Let T be a R-rever,qible, J 2n -sumpleciu: map and suppose that
the origin is a R-invariant fixed point of T.
Then K = DRoJ2I,DRoTJ 2n

commutator of DTo.
Proof.
Because the ongm
IS a fixed point of T and DR, one has DTo-1 =
DRoDToDRo and DToTJ 2I,DTo = J 2I, .
Define L = J 2nDRo and K = L-1LT
then it is a simple verification to see that K DTo = DToK.
•
Note that DRo is symplectic if K
= -I2n and anti-symplectic if K
I 2n •
We conjecture that it is always possible to consider DRo as a direct sum of two
symplectic and anti-symplectic involutions, respectively.
Lemma F.2. h qeneraies a Tc-reoersible map iff h(x, y) = h(y, x).
Proof. The key to the proof is to remember that the generating function for T-1
is given by h(x, y) = -h(y, x) if h is the generating function of T.
Now, suppose that h(x, y) = h(y, x), V(x, y) E U (a neighborhood ofthe origin).
Then, the equations corresponding to (2.3a) are
By uniqueness of the solutions we find that T}I(X,y) = T 1(x,-y).
Writing the
components of T, T 1 and T 2 , and replacing into (2.3b), we have that
Hence, T- 1 = RTR.
For the reverse implication, note that
(x, y) ...... (T1(x, -y), x)
is a local diffeomorphism as T is a twist map. Then, from (2.3), we find that

198
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
And so, hx(x,y) = hx'(y,x), V(x,y) E U. As
h(x, y) =1
1
(hx(xt, y), x) dt + h(O, y) =1
1
(hx'(y, tx), x) dt + h(O, y),
we find that
h(x, y) = h(y, x) - h(y, 0) + h(O, y),
and so h(x, 0) = h(O, x). We have finished, as a similar calculation starting with the
other derivative gives
h(x,y) = h(y,x) - h(O,x) +h(x,O) = h(y,x).
•
There is another concept of reversibility that appears when the action is res-
tricted to period­q sequences. In this case the action is taken to be invariant under
the reversal of periodic sequences of points (cf. (2.21)), that is
We say that T is CS-rever,qible (for configuration space) if (F.1) is true for all q
2,
that is if Wg is Kg ® I,,­invariant (for Kg as defined in (2.21)). In that case we can
prove that h satisfies the following. No greater generality is obtained when K ® R
with R 2 = I".
Lemma F .3. T is CS-reversible iff its generating function h satisfies
h(x,y) = h(y,x) - g(x) +g(y)
for some function g.
(F.2)
Proof. That the condition on h is sufficient is readily verified by direct calculation.
To see its necessity, let us take q = 3. By twice differentiating the condition on
W(xo,xo) with respect to Xo and X2, we see that h satisfies
hxx'(x,y) = hxx'(y,x),
V(x,y)EU.
With a calculation similar to the proof of Lemma F.2, we find that this implies
And so,
h(x,y) = h(y,x) + (h(O,y) - h(y,O))) - (h(O,x) - h(x,O)) ,
which is our conclusion with g(x)
h(O,x) - h(.x,O).
•

APPENDICES
199
As a consequence of the previous two lemmas, R-revepsibility implies also CS-
reversibility. We can now present our conclusion that the two notions of reversibility
are equivalent modulo conjugations.
Proposition FA. A CS-reversible map T is conjugate to a Tc-reversible map.
Proof. Let h be a generating function satisfying (F.2) with some g. Define
y) = h(x, y) + !g(x) - !g(y),
then
generates a R-reversible map (from Lemma F.2). By construction hand hare
dynamically equivalent, hence their induced maps are conjugate by the symplectic
change of variables (x, y) f-> (x, Y - !,vxg(x)) (cf. Appendix G).
•
Appendix G. Twist maps and dynamical equivalence
Consider a local diffeomorphism T on R2n defined around the origin, a fixed
point:
x' = T](x, y)
y' = T 2(x,y).
(G.la)
(G.lb)
We suppose that T is a twist map, that is, lay Tjl
=1= O. That property means
that we can use the Implicit Function Theorem to construct an equivalent map relat-
ing the configuration space (x-coordinates) to the ph.ase space ((x, y)-coordinates):
we solve (G.la) to get y = K1(x,x') then y' = K 2(x,x')
T 2(x,K](x,x')) by
substituting into (G.lb), and so we get another map on R2n
y =K](x,x')
y' = K 2(x,x').
(G.2a)
(G.2b)
It is easy to verify that there is a 1-1 correspondence between T and K. In general
there are no relations between K] and K 2 , but
(a) when T is symplectic there exist coordinates and a function h such that
K](x,x') = -hx(x,x') and K 2(x,x') = hx'(x,x').
(b) when T is reversible, there exists coordinates such that K 2(x, x') = -K] (x, x').
In Dewar & Meiss [1992] the concept of "dynamical equivalence" for area-
preserving maps is defined:
Two maps are dynamically equivalent if their orbits restricted to configuration
space are identical.
To formalize the idea we proceed as follows.
We can derive from K a map in configuration space which represents the dy-
namics of the projection onto configuration space of the dynamics on phase space
generated by T.

200
SINGULARITIES ... SYMPLECTIC MAPS
As T is twist, the map ¢J: (x,y)
f-+ (x,x' = TI(x,y)) is a local diffeomorphism
and so T e = ¢JT¢J-I sending (x, x') -+ (x', x") is a local diffeomorphism.
Every
orbit of T e is a projection of an orbit of T and is defined by any two consecutive
points.
We say that two twist maps T I , T 2 are dynamically equivalent if the two maps
they define on configuration space are identical.
The question then arises of the relation between two dynamically equivalent
maps or, in other words, what freedom do we have when reconstruciinq T from T e .
We believe that for symplectic (or reversible) maps that freedom is constrained
to the set of conjugate maps, meaning that the dynamics of T is wholly captured
by T e .
To justify that conjecture for symplectic maps, observe that orbits (XQ, ... , xn)
of T are stationary points of the actions W(XQ ,X n ) = L::':II h(xi-I, Xi) with variables
(XI, ... ,Xn-I), that is, they are solutions of the following Euler-Lagrange equations:
(G.3)
Clearly, the multiplication of h by any real number or the addition of a constant
has no effect on (G.3) and merely scales (and/or reverses) the y-axis (see(2.3)).
Maybe less obvious, once we have fixed the y-axis, is the conjecture that dynamical
equivalence is only possible by the addition to the action of a "null-Lagrangian"
term g(x') - g(x) with 9 : Rn -+ R being any function. It is readily verified that the
equations (G.3) are then unchanged and the two maps are related by some simple
symplectic transformations in phase space (see Dewar & Meiss [1992]).
In our analysis we have extensively used the twist property of T. How rare is
that property? Simple area-preserving examples show that nonzero twist is not an
invariant of changes of coordinates. And so the only maps we cannot deal with are
those which cannot be put into a twist form.
For area-preserving maps there are
only two such cases, when DTo = ±I.
Appendix H. Zq-equivariant bifurcation equations and linear
stability
The determinant of the Jacobian for lq-equivariant maps on R2 is important
for reduced stability (d.
the Stability Lemma I 2.10).
In this appendix we give
formulae for the determinant. The results are formulated for general (not necessarily
gradient) lq-equivariant bifurcation equations, the greater generality requiring little
additional effort. Restriction of the formulae - for use in Chapter 4 and elsewhere
- to the gradient case is then straightforward.
A general Zs-equivariant bifurcation equation for q :::: 3 takes the following form
h(z, A) = f(u, v, A) z + g(u, V, A)zq-l,
q :::: 3.

APPENDICES
201
Note that we use the same coordinates for all q
3 (that is also for q = 4; il-
luminating simplifications do not arise when q = 4).
The functions f and 9 are
complex-vallLed Dq­invariant functions and A represents parameter space. The com-
ponents of h (as a real map) are given by the real and imaginary parts of h.
The only linear stability information worth recording is the sign of the determi-
nant of D z h as this is the only quantity related to stability which is an invariant of
lq­equivariant contact equivalence. On the other hand, if h is also Dq­equivariant
(forcing f, 9 to be real­valued), information about the trace of Dzh can be preserved
only for those classes of bifurcation diagrams where the leading terms of the trace
are invariants of the change of coordinates. The determinant of D z h is given by the
following result:
Lemma H.I.
For any differentiable lq-eqlLivariant map h considered as a [unc-
tion of the two independent variables z ;z, the determinant of the derivative map is
IDzhl = Ihzl2 ­ Ihz­j2 .
Proof. Using the complex notation, the derivative of h is given by the following
linear map
Dzh(z)w = hz . W + hz ·w,
Vw E C.
When represented in real coordinates it becomes

Appendix I. About symmetric symplectic operators
Let I: be a compact Lie group and consider a I:-equivariant J-symplectic map
T, that is:
(a) DT(z)TJ(z)DT(z) = J(z), Vz near 0, for a (nonlinearly dependent) skew-
symmetric matrix J,
(b) T'[oz) = c T{c), Vz near 0, VCI E I:.
The general problem, to understand what (a) and (b) together imply for the
relationship between J and the action of I:, is beyond the scope of this work. Nev-
ertheless we are going to make some remarks about some aspects of the question.
First, as our bifurcations are of a local nature, it should be possible to linearize
the symplectic structure and the group-equivariance around fixed-points for both T
and the I:-action. In that case, note that we could consider - with little extra effort
- the initial action of I: to be nonlinear also.
An important, maybe the only important, case where this is possible is when the
symplectic form induced by J is I:-invariant. Then, the action of I: is symplectic and
the Equivariant Darboux Theorem (Montaldi & Roberts & Stewart [1988], Dellnitz
& Melbourne [1992]) tells us that J can be put - by a I:-equivariant change of
coordinates - into the following normal form J (we refer to Chapter 8 for background
to the notation).
R2I' decomposes into a direct sum EBl=l V; of I:-invariant subspaces (for some
integer l). The V;'s are each a direct sum of different isomorphic irreducible sub-
spaces Wi, 1
i
t, distinguished by the homomorphism type Ki of the space of
I:-conulluting endoniorphisms of Wi. There are three types Ki = R, C and H. And
so the symplectic form decomposes into
1-
J = EBi=l J,
with an unique class when K, = R or Hand :;0 we can take J, = J 2n i in those
cases. When Ki = C the problem is more subtle, there are ni + 1 (see (8.1) for ni)
nonequivalent classes of symplectic forms given by
for some 0 :::; k

For simplicity, in this work the implications of the above result are not considered;
in all cases the canonical form J = J 21, is used.
Now suppose that the symplectic form is locally constant, generated by J, and
that I: acts (orthogonally) on R2I' , but without any further assumptions. Then

Lemma 1.1. T zs L,-equivariant and J-symplectic iff (jTJ(jJ zs a commutator of
DT(z), I;j z near O.
Proof. T J-symplectic means that (DT(z)) -1 = -JDT(z)J, as T L,-equivariant
means that DT((jz) = (jDT(z )(jT and so putting the two conditions together (jTJ(jJ
is a commutator of DT(z), I;j z near O.
•
In particular ±In are always commutators and so, in principle, one cannot rule
out that elements of L, can act symplectically (the usual situation in practice) or
anti-symplectically or even both ways on different subspaces!
In this work the type of symmetry we consider is restricted further. We assume
that the L,-action lifts from configuration-space to phase-space, that is, we want h
to satisfy the following L,-equivariance:
(I.1)
where (j1, resp. (j2, denote the image of o E L, by an orthogonal representation of
L, on Rn, resp.
R.
Clearly the second action on R can only be the identity (the
case we consider in this work) or an 12-action. And so we get the following relation
between the symmetry (1.1) of h and the symmetry (1.2) of T.
Proposition 1.2.
The generating function h satisfies (1.1) iff the symplectic map
T it defines satisfies
(1.2)
Proof. If h satisfies (I.1) then
Moreover, T is given by the use of the Implicit Function Theorem on (2.3).
It
is now a typical exercise using the uniqueness of the solution to show that T is
L,-equivariant with the action as defined in (1.2).
Conversely, if T is L,-equivariant we get that
hx(x, T 1(x, y)) = (j2(j1Th x(j1 X,(j1T1(x, y)),
hX'(X, T 1(x, y)) = (j2(j1Th xl(j1 X,(j1T1(x, y)),
and so, as 1> : (x, y) >--+ (x, x') is a diffeomorphism
hx(x, y) = (j2(j1Th x(j1 z , (j1 y) ,
hx,(x,y) = (j2(j1Thx,(j1X, (j1 y) .

By integration from the fixed-point (the origin, say),
h(x, y) =1

< hx(tx, y), x > +h(O, y)
and so
(1.3)
As h is defined modulo constants we can take h" = 0, hence h((1'I X,O) = (1'2h(x,0)
and similarly h(O, (JI y) = (J2 h(O,y).
Going back to (1.3) we see that this implies
that h((JIx, (Jly) = (J2h(x, y).
•
Condition (1.1) imposes that we always get an even number of copies of irre-
ducible representations of E, It is not a restriction for real blocks but certainly one
for complex and quaternionic blocks. It is not exactly clear what it means in practi-
cal terms to study an equivariant map whose symmetry does not show-up explicitly
in configuration space. The choice of that space has some importance.
Because there is a 1-1 correspondence between maps and generating functions
the symmetry of the map is buried somewhere in the Taylor expansion of h. The
question is how to read it from h.
The simplest examples we can consider are Sl-equivariant twist maps on R2
C. The equivariant maps are of the form T(z) = e i 9(zz) z, for any function () : R+ ---+
R. The quadratic terms of the generating function are

They have no obvious linear symmetry (note that the dynamics of T in configuration
space is the projection of the dynamics of T onto the x-axis). Obviously this example
becomes very simple when dealt with using polar coordinates. Let
x = Vi cos <p,
y = Vi sin e ,
then T becomes a classical twist map
r' = r
<pI = <p +()(r ) .
We can use <p as configuration coordinate and get the following generating function
g(<p,<p') = 0(<p -1/)
with (0')-1(7') = -(}(-r).
Clearly we recover the Sl-symmetry with a diagonal
action by phase shift. However, the implication of the phase shift symmetry on the
generating function in cartesian coordinates is unclear (d. (1.4)).

The question, of determining the restricted action of a phase-space symmetry
on configuration space, becomes rapidly more obscure as can be seen already with
In-equivariant area-preserving maps.
Appendix J. (p,q)-resonances for symplectic maps
The bifurcation of periodic points for symplectic maps when the linear part
has multiple resonances can be quite complicated.
In this appendix we describe
the group-theoretic framework for the bifurcation of periodic points when the linear
map DTo has two resonant multipliers, referring to this as the case of simple (p, q)-
resonance. We assume throughout that 3 :::: p :::: q. The cases p, q = 1 or 2 could
also be included, but the group-theoretic aspect is less rich and the analysis must be
separated into many special cases, in particular the different Jordan block structures
must also be taken into account.
Consider a A-parametrized family T of symplectic maps such that DTo has
two pairs of resonant multipliers on the unit circle: exp( k rri) and exp(
with
p
g
{l',p} = {$,q} = 1 with «> v >3) ({.,.} denotes the g.c.d.). We assume that no
other resonances are present and so look for periodic solutions in the space of period-
[p,q] points (where [" .] is the l.c.m.}, Using the framework introduced in Section 2,
locally there exists a generating function and action which generate the symplectic
map T. Restriction of the action to the space of period-[p, q] points results in the
functional

W[p,gj(x, A) = L
h(xi , xi+1 , A).

Let LO = Hess;W[o

Zl
(respectively Z2) is the coordinate for the eigenspace corresponding to the P:
multipliers (respectively q-multipliers). The linear part of the map is controlled by
the (multi)parameter

the distance from the rational values.
Application of the Splitting Lemma to W[p,g] (x, A) reduces the problem to a
gradient bifurcation problem on C2 . The reduced potential will be Z[p,g]-equivariant
with action:
I def

I def
where p = p/ p,q
and q = q/{p,q}.
Without loss of generality, we suppose also that the map is reversible. This
leads to more general results in the sense that the isotropy subgroup lattices for
Z[p,g] can be simply read off the ones for O[p,g].
The method we are going to describe, to find the O[p,gtinvariants and construct
the lattice of isotropy subgroups, applies equally well to the Z[p,gtProblem. The

(because {rq', sp'} = {r, s}) .
Then
L = p-l([P,q]Z) = p-I({r,s} [p,q]Z),

that the sum of the monomials corresponding to (k, i) and (- k; -I) gives an invariant
for D[p,q].

Appendix K. About reversible equivariant symplectic maps
In this appendix we are going to limit our analysis to reversible symplectic maps
i where the reversor R acts anti-sympleetically and the group
acts symplectically
with j being the symplectic operator. It is of course possible to consider the same
degree of generality as in Appendices F and I in which case we would end up with
similar relations for DRo , j and nr-. But, as we cannot yet exploit this generality
very efficiently, we consider only the simpler situation.
From the Equivariant Darboux Theorem there exists a
change of
coordinates bringing the symplectic operator into canonical form j
(cf. Appendix
I) and R is transformed into another J-antisymplectic involution, say R, reversing
T, the transformation of i.
An immediate question that arises is whether or not R can be linearized? We
do not know the answer in all cases, but certainly yes if R and
commute. This
is obtained by averaging in the proof of Meyer [1981J where such linearization was
performed in the non-equivariant situation.
Now suppose that such a linearization has been done, that is, R is now a
matrix.
There are examples where R and
do not commute but one can make
them skew-commute by enlarging
by including
We suppose that this has
been done (i and T are still
even for the larger group) and so 'V (I,

Appendix L. Bifurcations and critical points of equivariant
functionals
In this appendix we deal with some technicalities used to reduce a one parameter
bifurcation of critical points to a problem of critical points on spheres.
When the bifurcation problem is of the type VxG(x, A) = -A x +f(x) it is well-
known that one can derive a functional tjJ(x) such that finding small critical points
of G is equivalent to find critical points of tjJ on a topological sphere in z-space (cf.
Mawhin & Willem [1989] for an account of the theory). Here we want to extend the
result to equivariant problems and to general dependence of f on the parameter A.
The first question is easy as it is a simple exercise to verify that the proofs
carryover to the equivariant situation. The second question seems technically more
delicate and we can only give a partial answer although we believe that it should be
true in all the cases we consider in this work.
To attack the problem we are going to show that subject to reasonable assump-
tions it is possible to cast the problem into its traditional shape where the usual
results will apply.
We consider an orthogonal action of a compact group r on Rn . We say that
a r-equivariant bifurcation functional G : Rn+1 ---+ R is finite if one of the following
holds true:
(a) G(x, A) =
IlxW + F(x) for some F : Rn ---+ R, or
(b) there exists a number lEN such that for all r-equivariant functionals H such
that jl+1G = jl+l H we have (VxG
VxH; KD where JIG denotes the jet of
order 1of G.
Note that (b) corresponds to finite gradient determinacy. If (b) is satisfied then
VxG is
-equivalent to its k-jet. We have to use
for the gradients
as we have seen in the introduction of Chapter 3 that
for functionals
would in general not give finite determined (hence finite) problems.
We need the following preparatory lemma.
Lemma L.l. Let G : Rn+l ---+ R be a finite r.-equivariant smooth functional such
that j 3G(x, A) = G3(x) -
IlxW for some G3 then (VxG '" VxCJ ; KD where G
is of the form
IlxW + F(x) for some smooth F.
Proof. If G satisfies (a) then the result is immediate. Otherwise, let 1be the order
of finiteness of G. We proceed by induction to show that we can remove all terms
with a A-dependence up to order 1+ 1, then use (b) to remove the higher order
terms.
For any integer k 2': 1, consider the following sequence of functionals
such that

As Gk - , is of order at least i + 3 we can use Hadamard's Lemma (Gibson [1979])
to get a smooth ii, of order at least i + 2 in x satisfying (L.3).
The last thing to do is to take care of the equivariance.
Note that Gk-i is
f-equivariant and so we can average Vi via
where eli is the Haar measure of f. An easy calculation shows that u ; is equivariant
and moreover satisfies (L.3) (recall that I' is acting orthogonally):
For i = k - 1, the computations are simpler as 1/JZ-l can be now taken as
independent of A. For Uk+l of order at least k + 1,
Again it is enough to solve Gi(:r) = (:r,uk-l).
This shows that we can push
the additional A-dependence to any order we want and then apply (b).

And so we get the main result.

dimensional bifurcation parameter A, let us denote the two [umcisonols W q , resp.

The integer ca.tj-Ker L" is the equivariant Lusternik-Schnirelman category of the
unit sphere in ker L".
Proof. From Lemma L.1 we can cast G into a form G to which one can apply the
standard techniques (Mawhin & Willem [1989], Section 6.5) to get the equivalence
between \lxG = °and a critical point problem for a functional ¢ defined on any
small topological sphere around the origin.
Hence the conclusion as we can average each step of the construction.
•
Remarks, corollaries. (a) One can prove that condition (b) of finiteness is satisfied
for G iff it is satisfied for G.
(b) Finite
(or finite gradient

implies finiteness of G.
(c) As in Stuart [1979] we can extend the result to Hilbert spaces using the approach
of Damon [1986] to deal with singularities of Fredholm maps.
Appendix M. Instability Lemma
In this appendix we show that one can determine loss of stability on the bifur-
cating branches from the reduced bifurcation equations in a general context.
Instability Lemma M.l.
Let T
be a family of symplectic twist maps on R2I•
parametrized by A E R.
For some e > 0, consider the following intervals U, for
A = 0: (-f, 0) or (0, f).
Suppose that a(DT(O, A)q) C 51 \ {I}, If A E U"
and that
1 E a(DTDq) (it means that the origin is linearly stable for A E U,). Let W q be the
reduced functional for the bifurcating period-q points.
Then, for (11x II, A) sufficiently small, the period-q point bifurcating from the
origin corresponding to (X, A) is unstable if, for any). E U"
Note that T can be equivariant.
Proof. The fundamental result we need is formula (2.36) linking the residues to the
Hessian of the action. With our hypotheses we know that we can use our framework
to reduce, via the Splitting Lemma, the bifurcation problem for the action Wq into a
bifurcation problem on Ker L" where LD = Hess;W;. Note that its structure might
be much more complicated that what we have studied so far. Then we can use the
splitting (2.38) and formula (2.36) to get the value of the product of the residues
for the map T on some branch (X, A) of solutions of \lxWq(X, A) = 0.

APPENDICES
213
Now we use the hypothesis that all the multipliers for (0,

are
on the unit circle but not at 1, this means that all the residues are strictly positive
and so

Appendix N. Isotropy and twisted subgroups
As lq is abelian and I; x I q is a direct product we can transfer to our context the
discussions in GSS II [1988, Section XVI. 7/8, p.300-307] and the subsequent papers
mentioned in this appendix about the action of r x 51 in the context of Equivariant
Hopf bifurcation.
The key concepts transfer very well, but we obtain sometimes
only a weaker version of some results due to the discrete symmetry brought by Zq.
Let us elaborate on the basic results, the references providing more information.
Let II C I; x lq be an isotropy subgroup.
For any
1", we denote by L; the
subgroup I x L; C I; x I q . In general I q might not act freely, but we can factor
out the temporal subqrowp of II, I;
II n t; where 7' is given by Z; = lq/r.
As
every element of Zq commutes with II we can define Zr(WII) = Zq /Z; (d. Section
8.1). Now we can show the equivalent to Proposition XVI.7.3, that is, all isotropy
subgroups of I; x Zq are twisted subgroups.
Proposition N.1.
Let II C I; x Zq be an i$otropy subqroiip ; then there exits a
subqroicp :::: C I; and a group homomorplusni () : :::: -t Zr(WII) such. that

Proof. Consider II' =
c L.x lq and the natural projection t:' : L.x lr(WII) --+
L.. As II' n lr(WII) = {I}, n' is an isomorphism from II' onto 7f'(II').
Define
3 = t:' (II') and we can conclude like in GSS II.
•
Note that the subgroup of spatial symmetries K:
Ker 8 is a normal subgroup
of L.. Following Golubitsky & Stewart [1993] we can also characterize the normalizer
NIl and the Weyl subgroup WII = NIl/II of II in L.x lq by following their line of
proof.
Proposition N.2.
NIl = C(3, q
x t;
WII = (C(3, q/3) x lr(WII) .
Note that the example of the O(2)-equivariant maps on A4 show that the main
conclusion of the Golubitsky & Schaeffer paper do not hold in the discrete map
setting.
Finally, in our context the dimension of the fixed-point subspaces is of prime
interest for all the isotropy subgroups.
Without resonances
= I and we can
readily adapt Proposition XVI.8.3 in GSS II to get the following.
Given a twisted subgroup 3° C L.x lq with spatial subgroup K, then, one can
show that
(a) If 8(3) = I then dim (Fix 3°)=2 dim (Fix 3),
(b) If 8(3) = r, then dim (Fix 3°)=2 [dim (Fix K)-dim (Fix 3)],
(c) If 8(3) = l3 then dim (Fix 3 0)=dim (Fix K)-dim (Fix 3),
(d) If 8(3) = r, then dim (Fix 3 0)=dim (Fix q-dim (Fix f),
(e) If 8(3) = l6 then
dim (Fix38 ) = dim (Fix E] + dim (Fixq - dim (Fix C) - dim (FixM),
where c and M are the unique subgroups satisfying K C c. M c 3 with 1::::/£1 = 3
and 13/MI = 2.
