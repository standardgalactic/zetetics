1. Components of an infinitesimal displacement. Consider an ordinary 
three-dimensional Euclidean space. Take a right rectangular trihedron T at 
an arbitrary point M of this space. The set of all orthogonal trihedrons of the 
space depends on six parameters (three coordinates of the vertex and three Euler 
angles defining a rotation of a trihedron with respect to a fixed right orthogonal 
trihedron with the vertex O): 
ui,u2,... 
,u6. 
The trihedron T can be defined by the position vector M = OM of its vertex 
and by the three mutually orthogonal unit vectors of its axes: 
Il,l2,l3-
Define an infinitesimally close1 trihedron T' that is associated with a point 
M'. The location of the new trihedron T' with respect to the trihedron T is 
determined by the increments of the position vector of its vertex, 
M' -M 
= dM, 
and unit vectors of its axes, 
I' f c-I f c=dl f c, 
k = 1,2,3. 
In the above formulas we denote the vectors defining an infinitesimally close 
trihedron by M' and I'fc. If we project the differentials dM and dlk onto the 
axes It of the trihedron T, then we obtain the equations of an infinitesimal 
lrThe coordinates ui +dui,...

PRELIMINARIES 
(differential) displacement of the trihedron T: 
dM = LJ1^ + w2I2 + w3I3, 
dl1 = wjli + w2I2 + w?I3, 
dl2 = c^Ii + w|l 2 + w|l 3, 
dl3 = u^Ii + wfl2 + wf I3, 
(1.1) 
or briefly, 
cM = w%, dli=u}flj, 
t,j = 1,2,3. 
Here and in what follows, the summation symbol is omitted in sums when the 
sum index occurs twice, once up and once down. Note also that in the above 
formulas the quantities CJ1, i = 1,2,3, are the projections of the differential dM 
on the axes Ik- Hence they are infinitesimals and may be expressed linearly 
in terms of the differentials dua of the independent variables ua, a = 1,... , 6. 
Thus they are linear differential forms, and the same is true for the quantities 
A = TLdua. 
(1.2) 
2. Relations among 1-forms of an orthonormal frame. The linear 
forms u>1 and w\ cannot be given arbitrarily. First of all, they are connected 
by relations imposed by the fact that the vectors I& of the trihedron T are 
orthonormal. This condition is expressed by the following formulas: 
(1.3) 
I? = 1, 
II = 1, 
I | = 1, 
I i - I 2 = 0 , 
I 2 - I 3 = 0 , 
I 3 - I i = 0 . 
Differentiating these equations, we find that 
Ij • d\i = 0 (i not summed), Ij • dli +1$ • dlj = 0, 
i, j = 1,2,3. 
Substituting the values of the differentials dli taken from equations (1.1) into 
the above equations and taking into account (1.3), we find that 
u)\ — 0 (i not summed), u)\ + u>] — 0, i ^ j . 
(1.4) 
Thus there are only three independent 1-forms among the forms CJ? , namely the 
forms w|, w3, and u)\. These 1-forms can be called the components of rotation 
of the trihedron. The components w* are called the components of translation 
of the trihedron. 
Later, we will see that the forms w% and w\ satisfy some additional differential 
relations.

3. Finding the components of a given family of trihedrons. If a 
motion of a trihedron is given, i.e., if one knows the coordinates of the position 
vector M and the unit axis vectors Ijt, then the components ui1 of the translation 
and the components w\ of the rotation of the trihedron can be easily calculated 
by means of equations (1.1). 
Suppose that the vectors M and Ifc are given by their coordinates, 
M(x,y,z), 
liicti^i^i). 
Multiplying the first equation of (1.1) by the vector Ii, we find that 
Ii • dM = wJIi • Ii + w2Ii • I2 + w3Ii • I3, 
or, by equations (1.3), 
o ; 1 = I 1 - d M , 
(1.5) 
or 
ui1 =Ii(ai,/3i,7i) 
•dM(dx,dy,dz). 
By the scalar product formula, the last equation implies that 
ui1 = aidx + j3\dy + jidz. 
In general, we have 
UJ% = a^dx + Pidy + jidz. 
(1.6) 
Similarly, for example, we have 
u\ = I 3 • dl2 = a3da2 + fcdfc + 73^72 
(1.7) 
and in general, 
u>l = ctjdcti + (3jd[3i + jid'jj. 
(1.8) 
Theorem 1. For any choice of six parameters ua, a = 1,... , 6, the six forms 
ujl, U)] = —cjj are linearly independent. 
Proof. To prove this theorem, it is sufficient to note that not only does the 
vanishing of the differentials dua, a = 1,... , 6, make the differentials dM and 
dli vanish, and as a result, the forms a/, u)\, vanish, but also conversely: by 
equations (1.1), if CJ1 = 0 and UJ\ = 0, then dM. = 0, dli = 0, the trihedron is 
fixed, and all parameters ua are constant.

4. Moving frames. In a similar way, with a point M of the Euclidean space, 
instead of an orthogonal trihedron (more precisely, an orthonormal trihedron, 
with unit axial vectors) one can associate an arbitrary oblique (nondegenerate) 
trihedron. The latter has variable angles and lengths of basis vectors with the

PRELIMINARIES 
only requirement that these basis vectors are linearly independent (i.e., they do 
not lie in a plane). 
More precisely, to any point with position vector M, we associate three 
arbitrary vectors e*, i = 1,2,3, with nonvanishing triple scalar product, 
(ei,e 2,e 3) ^ 0, 
i.e., the determinant composed of the coordinates of these vectors with respect 
to a fixed coordinate system does not vanish. 
The figure formed by the point M and three vectors e, (i.e., a moving system 
of oblique coordinates), is called a frame or a moving frame. The vectors M 
and &i can be considered as functions of 3 + 3-3 = 12 arbitrary parameters 
ua, a = 1,... ,12 (their coordinates with respect to a fixed coordinate system). 
Then the differentials dM and dei are homogeneous linear functions of the 
differentials dua of the independent variables ua. 
The vectors dM and dei 
decompose with respect to the axes of our moving system, i.e., with respect to 
the triple of linearly independent vectors ei, e2, e3, and we obtain the following 
system of equations which is similar to the system of equations (1.1): 
dM = w1ei + u2e2 + u>3e3, 
V 
/ 
dei = Wi Ii + ufa + wfl3, 
where, as before, w' and UJ\ are linear forms with respect to the differentials dua 
of the independent variables ua. However, formulas (1.3) are not valid, and as 
a result, equations (1.4) are also not valid. 
5. Line element of the space. Introduce the notation 
ei • ej = gij, g^ = g^, 
(1-10) 
for the scalar products of the basis vectors. According to the geometric meaning 
of the scalar product, the quantity g^ is equal to the product of the lengths of 
the vectors e^ and e.,- multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them. On 
the other hand, squaring both parts of the first equation of (1.9), we obtain the 
square of the line element of the space: 
ds2 = (dM)2. 
Using the rule of squaring a polynomial (the sum of squares and double products 
of all mixed terms of a polynomial), in notations (1.10), we obtain 
ds2 
= (ei) 2^ 1) 2 + ... + 2ei • e2w1w2 + ... 
= QiM? 
+ S22(u2)2 + <?33(^3)2 
(1-11) 
+2#i2w1w2 + 2p23W2u;3 + 2g31u3uj1. 
This can be written in a shorter form: 
ds2 = gijwW.

This formula is valid also for an n-dimensional Euclidean space when the indices 
i and j run over the values 1,2,... , n. 
In formula (1.12), there are two pairs of identical indices, i and j , and there 
are two independent summations. For each pair of distinct indices, for example, 
1 and 2, there are two terms: one with i = 1 and j = 2, and another with 
i = 2 and j = 1. By the symmetry of the coefficients gij (see (1.10)), these 
two terms are equal. As a result, in the expanded sum (1.11), all terms with 
different indices i,j(i ^ j) enter with the coefficient 2. The scalar product of 
two vectors 
X = Xiei, 
Y = Y% 
can be computed in a similar way. Applying the scalar product rules, we find 
that 
X Y = e* ejX'Y' 
= gijX'Y*. 
(1.13) 
It follows that the cosine of the angle <p between two vectors X and Y is 
cos^ = 
, 
9iiX%YL=.

6. Contravariant and covariant components. Multiply a vector 
X = Xkek 
(1.15) 
by the vector e^. If we denote the product X-e* by Xi and apply formula (1.10), 
then we find that 
Xi = gikXk. 
(1.16) 
The components Xk are called the contravariant components of a vector X, 
and the components Xk are called the covariant components of a vector X. 
The contravariant components are denoted by upper indices, and the covariant 
components are denoted by lower indices. 
Multiplying both parts of equations (1.16) by Xi and summing with respect 
to the index i, we obtain 
X i X i = f l i f c X i X f e = X 2 , 
(1.17) 
and similarly, 
X-Y 
= gikXiYk=XiYi. 
(1.18) 
In order to pass from covariant components to contravariant components, one 
must solve the system of n equations (i = 1,2,... , n) (1.16) with n unknowns 
Xk, k = 1,... , n. By the well-known algebraic formula, a solution has the form 
Xk = gikXu

where glk is the reduced cofactor of the entry gik in the determinant 
9 = det(gij) ^ 0, 
i.e, it is the cofactor of the entry go, divided by the determinant g. All these 
can be also applied to the infinitesimal components LJ% or Wj. 
For an orthonormal frame, we have 
Q..-S..-i 
°- if 
^ 3 , 
913 ~ 6lJ ~ \ 1, if i = j . 
From equations (1.16), it follows that 
X{ = X , 
i.e., the covariant components of a vector are equal to its contravariant compo-
nents. When we use orthonormal frames, we write without distinction u% = uJi 
and UJ\ = Uij, and as before, we assume that repeated indices, one up and one 
down, imply the summation.2 
7. Infinitesimal affine transformations of a frame. Note also that for 
an oblique frame, we can no longer say that equations (1.9) determine a frame 
motion since our trihedrons are not congruent. However, it is not difficult to 
check that under the passage from one coordinate trihedron to another one, the 
transformation of coordinates x\x2,x3 
is determined by a linear substitution. 
In fact, if we denote by a\ the cosines of the angles between the old and new 
axes, by xl and of the old and new coordinates of an arbitrary point, and by 
XQ the coordinates of the new origin with respect to the old coordinate system, 
then we obtain the following expressions of the old coordinates: 
xl = xl
0+ a\~xx + al
2x2 + a\xz'. 
Since a general linear substitution defines an affine transformation, equations 
(1.9) define infinitesimal affine transformations of a frame. 
2Cartan will use this many times in the following chapters, sometimes in order to indicate 
that there is no summation and sometimes to match a location of indices on the left-hand 
and right-hand sides of an equation. This is also the reason that Cartan uses both terms "the 
vector" and "the form" for the quantities like wl = u<. {Translator's 
note.)
