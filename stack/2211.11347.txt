Abstract
Quantum gravity is expected to introduce quantum aspects into the description of reference
frames. Here we set the stage for exploring how quantum gravity induced deformations of classical
symmetries could modify the transformation laws among reference frames in an eﬀective regime.
We invoke the quantum group SUq(2) as a description of deformed spatial rotations and interpret
states of a representation of its algebra as describing the relative orientation between two reference
frames. This leads to a quantization of one of the Euler angles and to the new paradigm of agency-
dependence: space is reconstructed as a collection of fuzzy points, exclusive to each agent, which
depends on their choice of reference frame. Each agent can choose only one direction in which
points can be sharp, while points in all other directions become fuzzy in a way that depends on
this choice. Two agents making diﬀerent choices will thus observe the same points with diﬀerent
degrees of fuzziness.

Agency-dependent spacetime and spacetime-dependent agency
Observers typically play a somewhat “external” role in both general relativity (GR) and quantum
theory. In the former, they are assumed to exert a negligible backreaction on spacetime, which they can
thus probe without inﬂuencing it. In quantum theory, it is the Heisenberg cut [1,2] that separates them
from the observed system. The observers’ knowledge and choices are described classically, however,
there are mutually-incompatible measurements that they can choose to perform (complementarity).
Quantum mechanics introduces therefore an important novelty: the operationally-meaningful properties
of the observed systems depend on the choices made by the observer. Through the impact of these
choices, observers are “agents” for what concerns measurements in quantum mechanics.
When quantum theory and GR are combined in a quantum theory of gravity, one ends up considering
spacetime as a quantum object. We may then contemplate the possibility that the agency-dependence of
quantum mechanics might challenge the notion of an objective spacetime that all observers agree upon:
how spacetime reveals itself to observers may depend on some of their choices. This seems to be an
under-appreciated facet in the foundations of quantum gravity. Conversely, the quantum properties of
spacetime will likely aﬀect the spectrum of possible operations available to an agent. These observations
suggest a picture in which spacetime and the agency of observers aﬀect each other inextricably, so much
so that the “externality” idealization, a good working hypothesis in GR and quantum theory, will have
to be abandoned in favor of a notion of “internal” observers in quantum gravity [3].
In the present paper, we take a step toward this largely unexplored aspect of quantum gravity. We
cannot expect to begin with a complete model of an observer/agent in a quantum spacetime. Therefore,
we will be concerned with a particular aspect of this problem: the relative state of the reference frames
of two observers, Alice and Bob. In a simpliﬁed model, we assume that the two observers are exclusively
interested in ﬁnding out the relative spatial orientations of their respective laboratories. In standard
quantum theory, the rotation matrix relating the two reference frames can be determined by exchanging
qubits and classical information, as discussed in appendix C. With an arbitrarily large number of
exchanges, the two observers can determine the matrix elements with arbitrary precision. However, in

the case in which Alice and Bob live in a quantum spacetime, reaching an arbitrary precision may be
forbidden.
Quantum group toy model
We will focus on a toy model of quantum gravity in the form of a nonclassical space: this will be
the arena in which observers exercise their agency and will attempt to determine the structure of the
spacetime they are in. A much-studied candidate for a theory of quantum spacetime is noncommutative
geometry [4]. The idea is that, by replacing the (commutative) algebra of functions on a manifold
with a noncommutative algebra, we end up describing a manifold whose points are “fuzzy”, due to
the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
In this sense, standard quantum theory can be seen as the
noncommutative space one obtains by making the algebra of phase-space functions noncommutative.
Recent developments focused on deformed symmetries and quantum groups, in which the algebra of
functions on a Lie group is noncommutative [5]. As Lie groups describe the symmetries of classical
spaces, quantum groups describe the symmetries of noncommutative geometries; as such they have
appeared in several quantum gravity approaches [6–19]. In this regard, since we are only interested
in the relative orientation between reference frames, we can model our nonclassical space simply by
deforming the rotation group SO(3), or rather its double cover SU(2) which describes the rotations of
qubits.
To do so, we will be concerned with one of the simplest examples of quantum groups: SUq(2) [20],
which is the (only) quantum-group deformation of the SU(2) group.
The lowercase q identiﬁes a
dimensionless deformation parameter, such that the case q = 1 reproduces the undeformed SU(2)
group. In loop gravity models, q is a function of the dimensionless ratio between the Planck length
and the Hubble length scale associated to the cosmological constant [7]. It has been argued that this
reﬂects a minimal possible resolution in angular measurements [12].
The mathematical details of SUq(2) have been developed extensively [20–23]. We want to further
explore the physical features of this group to arrive at a qualitative prediction for the novel “quantum
geometrical” eﬀects that observers would see if, in an eﬀective regime of quantum gravity, rotations of
reference frames were described by SUq(2) transformations.

Quantum rotation matrices in SUq(2)
2.1
SUq(2) algebra and homomorphism with SOq(3)
The quantum group SUq(2) is deﬁned by considering the algebra of complex functions on SU(2),
denoted by C(SU(2)) and deforming it in a noncommutative way. The generators {a, c} are regarded
as functions on the group, satisfying non-trivial commutation relations
ac = qca
ac∗= qc∗a
cc∗= c∗c
c∗c + a∗a = 1
aa∗−a∗a = (1 −q2)c∗c .
(1)
Here, 1 refers to the identity element of the algebra and q is the deformation parameter assumed to
be close to 1 and in particular q ≲1. Indeed, in the q →1 limit, we obtain the commutative limit
and recover the classical description of SU(2). In passing, we mention that it suﬃces to consider q ≲1
since, if q > 1, the mapping a 7→a∗, c 7→qc∗sends the SUq(2) algebra to the SUq−1(2) one.
To establish a ﬁrst link with the classical picture, we present the generalization of the spin-1/2
representation (19), given by
Uq =
a
−qc∗
c
a∗

a, c ∈C(SUq(2))
q ∈(0, 1) .
(2)
We will now construct one of the key ingredients of the analysis which is a q-analogue of the SU(2) to
SO(3) homomorphism. In order to do so, we promote the classical homomorphism Rij = 1
2 Tr

σj U † σi U
	
,
where σi are the Pauli matrices, to its quantum version by replacing U with Uq
(Rq)ij = 1
2 Tr

σj U †
q σi Uq
	
.
(3)
By computing these elements explicitly, we obtain
2

Rq =


1
2(a2 −qc2 + (a∗)2 −q(c∗)2)
i
2(−a2 + qc2 + (a∗)2 −q(c∗)2)
1
2(1 + q2)(a∗c + c∗a)
i
2(a2 + qc2 −(a∗)2 −q(c∗)2)

2(a2 + qc2 + (a∗)2 + q(c∗)2)
−i
2(1 + q2)(a∗c −c∗a)
−(ac + c∗a∗)
i(ac −c∗a∗)
1 −(1 + q2)cc∗


(4)
and one can check that in the commutative limit q →1 this coincides with the matrix obtained via
the classical homomorphism. This matrix provides a (co)-representation of SOq(3) related to the (co)-
representation found in [23] by a similarity transformation. We note that in (3) the cyclic property of
the trace operation does not hold because of the noncommutative nature of a and c. This gives rise
to a “quantization ambiguity” which however does not aﬀect our phenomenological results. All these
technical issues are addressed in appendix A.
The classical analog of (4) describes all possible elements of SO(3) when varying the complex
numbers a and c with continuity. Each of these classical matrices describes a possible relative orientation
between observers A and B. In the quantum case (4) has no physical meaning when taken alone, but
only when paired with a certain state |ψ⟩∈H, where H is the Hilbert space on which a and c act.
In the classical case, a and c codify information about the alignment of two reference frames, via
their angular parametrization (see below and appendix A). For this reason, when being promoted to
operators, we interpret the states on which they act as the ones codifying the relative orientation
between the reference frames of observers A and B. The physical information about this orientation
can be extracted by computing the expectation values ⟨ψ|(Rq)ij|ψ⟩with their relative uncertainties
stemming from the noncommutative nature of these matrix elements, given by
∆ij =
q
⟨ψ|(Rq)2
ij|ψ⟩−⟨ψ|(Rq)ij|ψ⟩2 .
(5)
In this framework, the ∆ij do not vanish simultaneously, in general, for a given state |ψ⟩introducing
a “fuzziness” in the alignment procedure.
When this occurs, the latter is aﬀected by an intrinsic
uncertainty which cannot be eliminated: A and B are not able to sharply align their reference frames
anymore.
In light of these arguments, it is crucial to identify H and study the representations of
operators a and c on it.
2.2
SUq(2) representations and quantum Euler angles
The representations of algebra (1) have been thoroughly studied in [23]. The Hilbert space containing
the two unique irreducible representations of the SUq(2) algebra, q ∈(0, 1), is H = Hπ ⊕Hρ where
Hπ = ℓ2 ⊗L2(S1) ⊗L2(S1) and Hρ = L2(S1). If χ, φ ∈[0, 2π[ are coordinates on S1 and |n⟩is the
canonical basis of ℓ2, the algebra of functions on SUq(2) is represented as
ρ(a) |χ⟩= eiχ |χ⟩
ρ(a∗) |χ⟩= e−iχ |χ⟩
ρ(c) |χ⟩= ρ(c∗) |χ⟩= 0
(6)
π(a) |n, φ, χ⟩
=
eiχp
1 −q2n |n −1, φ, χ⟩
π(c) |n, φ, χ⟩= eiφqn |n, φ, χ⟩
(7)
π(a∗) |n, φ, χ⟩
=
e−iχp
1 −q2n+2 |n + 1, φ, χ⟩
π(c∗) |n, φ, χ⟩= e−iφqn |n, φ, χ⟩.
It is not coincidental that quantum number χ is common in both representations. We show in ap-
pendix D that representation ρ can be obtained as a limit of representation π, in agreement with the
fact that in the classical case we only need three real parameters to specify rotations.
Let us give physical meaning to the quantum numbers appearing in the representations above,
making a comparison between these relations and the classical parametrization of a and c for U ∈SU(2)
a = eiη cos θ
2
c = eiδ sin θ
2 ,
(8)
where η, δ and θ are a linear redeﬁnition of Euler angles, as discussed in appendix A. We note that
ρ(a) and ρ(c) act diagonally, therefore we can make the identiﬁcations χ ≡η and θ ≡0. These describe
a rotation of angle 2χ around the z-axis in (8). This classical picture can be carried over into the
q-deformed case too: the expectation value of the matrix (4) in the eigenstates |χ⟩gives
⟨χ|Rq|χ⟩=


cos(2χ)
−sin(2χ)

Figure 1: Discretized angles (10) computed with q = 0.9. θ(n) is decreasing with n starting from π and
approaching 0 for large values of n. Interestingly, the step between consecutive angles decreases as n
gets very larger, and for very large n we can approximate the angular distribution as being continuous.
This can easily be veriﬁed analytically by computing ∆θ(n) = θ(n + 1) −θ(n) and taking the limit for
n →∞. Another feature that gives robustness to our proposal is that the angular steps get smaller as
q is closer to 1.
with all the ∆ij being zero. Thus, two observers, A and B, whose relative orientation is described by
|χ⟩∈Hρ, can align themselves sharply.
For what concerns representation π, c acts diagonally, while a and a∗act as ladder operators. For
operator a, we added a phase, that is implicitly set to 0 in the literature [20], which does not aﬀect
commutation relations (1) and allows us to have a comparison of (7) with (8). From this, we identify
χ ≡η, φ ≡δ and, exploiting the fact that c acts diagonally, we are led to the signiﬁcant result
qn = sin
θ(n)
2

⇐⇒θ(n) = 2 arcsin(qn) .
(10)
The Euler angle θ becomes quantized, a feature captured in ﬁg. 1. The quantization of θ can also be
inferred using π(a) (see appendix A).
To gain further intuition from the classical picture, where rotations are speciﬁed by three Euler
angles, we henceforth focus on “semi-classical” rotations, speciﬁed by the three quantum numbers
θ(n), φ, χ, that describe small deformations of classical rotations deﬁned by these angles. More precisely,
the states |ψ(θ, φ, χ)⟩yielding such deformed rotations should satisfy



⟨ψ(θ, φ, χ)|(Rq)ij|ψ(θ, φ, χ)⟩= Rij(θ, φ, χ) + O(1 −q)
∆2
ij = O(1 −q)
∀i, j ,
(11)
where Rij ∈SO(3) and where θ is one of the allowed values in (10). This prescription constrains the
quantum rotations we can construct to the ones in which the θ Euler angle can only take the allowed
values in (10), for a ﬁxed q. To describe such rotations, we note that the basis states |n, φ, χ⟩generally
do not satisfy the ﬁrst condition in (11). Thus, we need to deal with their superpositions. Since φ and
χ are identiﬁed with their classical counterparts, we are led to consider superpositions
|ψ⟩=
∞
X
n=0
cn |n, φ, χ⟩
,
∞
X
n=0
|cn|2 = 1 .
(12)
Among the states of this form that satisfy (11), we need to ﬁnd those for which the uncertainties
are kept under control. The best way to do this is to demand that the coeﬃcients {cn} minimize the
functional

where µ is a Lagrange multiplier enforcing normalization of |ψ⟩. In general, solving the minimization
problem (13) is a daunting task computationally. Therefore, in appendix B we invoke physical intuition
to construct these states.
Fixing a value for q, we build superpositions of states |n, φ, χ⟩centered
around a certain ¯n ∈N. The expectation values and uncertainties relative to such states will reproduce
deformations of classical rotation matrices speciﬁed by angles (θ(¯n), φ, χ), in the sense of (11). The
states so obtained serve the purpose of showing, at least semi-classically, the eﬀects of the quantum
deformation of the rotation group.

Same stars, diﬀerent skies
Perhaps the most striking implication of our results is that they provide a possible scenario for a novel
type of relationship between observers and the spacetime they observe: to the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst mathematical framework suitable for modeling the possibility that the choices made by
the observer in setting up her reference frame aﬀect the spacetime she lives in.
We shall argue this by ﬁrst advocating Einstein’s operational notion of spacetime, whose points
have physical meaning only in as much as they label an event there occurring. We use as reference
example a network of sources emitting photons (“stars”): each photon emission is a physical point of
spacetime. These points of spacetime will be labeled by measured coordinates and uncertainties on
those coordinates. The key observation here is that, in our model, these uncertainties are not intrinsic
properties of the spacetime points but rather depend on the choices made by the observer. These
arguments give rise to a framework in which diﬀerent skies may originate from the observation of the
same stars.
3.1
Agency-dependent space
We will apply our formalism to establish the connection between the q-deformation of the SU(2) group
and the agency-dependence of space. Before showing this with a concrete numerical example, we will
discuss why this property of space is to be expected with a thought experiment.
Consider two observers, Alice and Bob, each equipped with their own set of telescopes, who want
to map the starry sky. Each of them chooses their reference frame (in particular their z-axis) to assign
coordinates to the stars they observe. We assume that their origins coincide but their z-axes do not.
Without loss of generality we can focus on the (y, z)-plane so that, for each observer, any telescope is
mapped onto another by a rotation about the x-axis. In the classical case, Alice and Bob can compare
their experimental results by rotating their data with a classical rotation matrix. Formally, there exists
an element of the SO(3) group that sharply describes the relative orientation between Alice and Bob.
We now analyze how the situation changes in our novel noncommutative framework. As in the
classical case we shall assume that the theory is relativistic without any preferred direction in space.
Therefore, we henceforth assume that Alice and Bob can choose the direction along which points can be
sharp independently from one another. For deﬁniteness, we focus on observer Alice ﬁrst. In her task of
mapping the starry sky, she focuses on a particular star, which she observes with one of her telescopes.
This instrument is generally misaligned with respect to the z-axis she has chosen. In our framework,
this means that there exists a state |ψA⟩connecting the relative orientation between the aforementioned
telescope and the z-axis. Following our physical interpretation, |ψA⟩determines a quantum rotation
matrix through the expectation value of Rq and an uncertainty matrix deﬁned by (5). This means that
Alice cannot appreciate the relative orientation between the telescope and her z-axis with arbitrary
precision since there will always be some intrinsic uncertainty given by the deformation of the SU(2)
group. As a consequence of this, she will not be able to sharply deduce the position of this star in the
sky. For that same star, this line of reasoning also applies to Bob but the state |ψB⟩will generally be
diﬀerent from |ψA⟩, implying a diﬀerent degree of fuzziness. In turn, this procedure can be applied to
any star in the sky so that Alice and Bob each have their own picture of the celestial sphere, as can be
seen in ﬁg. 2. The striking result is that the uncertainty associated with each star is not an intrinsic
property of spacetime but depends on the choices made by the observers. In particular, diﬀerent choices
of the z-axis give rise to diﬀerent pictures of the starry sky. The subtle observation is that there is no
way for Alice and Bob to deﬁne an objective celestial sphere, meaning that the deﬁnition of space itself
cannot be independent of the observer who reconstructs it. In this sense, we say that Alice and Bob
are agents: we are abandoning the idea of objective space, replacing it with a notion of observed space
from which we cannot subtract the choices of the observer who infers it.
As mentioned earlier, it is important to note that, even though the z-axis is a preferred direction
for observers (only its points can be sharp), our framework produces an isotropic description of space.

Figure 2: A semi-quantitative description of the starry skies observed by Alice and Bob. Alice’s z-axis
is aligned with the yellow star while Bob’s z-axis is aligned with the green star, so that the yellow star
is sharp for Alice while the green star is sharp for Bob. For Alice (Bob) the fuzziness increases as the
angular deviation from the yellow (green) star increases and the same stars are observed with diﬀerent
fuzziness because of the relative orientation of the z-axes of the two agents.
Indeed, spatial rotations are a (q-deformed) symmetry.
There is no direction which is preferred a
priori, and the special role played by the z-axis in the reference frame of a given observer is only the
result of the choices made by that observer in setting up their frame. The oberver chooses freely their
preferred z-direction. This should be contrasted with the case of standard spatial anisotropy, in which
diﬀerent directions have diﬀerent properties a priori, independently of the choices made by observers,
and invariance under spatial rotations is lost.
3.2
Numerical analysis
To gain insight into these conceptual novelties and to better grasp the meaning of ﬁg. 2, we now show
some numerical examples in support of our claims. We start with Alices’s point of view. Let her z-axis
be aligned with a certain star (α) and consider another star (β) she wants to observe from a telescope,
whose relative orientation with respect to the ﬁrst star is described by the following state:
|ψA⟩=
n = 0; φ = π
2 ; χ = 0
E
.
(14)
This state, which satisﬁes the “classicality” conditions (11), yields θ = π and can be seen as a q-
deformed rotation of π around the x-axis. The expectation value and the variances of (Rq)ij in this
state are

Identifying Alice’s z-axis with the vector v = (0, 0, 1) and applying these matrices on v, the transformed

The agency feature of the model can be well understood if we now compare these results with the ones
obtained if Alice chose to align her z-axis with star β. In this case she would have seen β sharply and
α under a cone with aperture (18). This line of reasoning can be extended when considering multiple
stars: diﬀerent states describing the relative orientation of these stars with respect to Alice’s z-axis
will produce diﬀerent uncertainties in determining their direction. In turn, this is characterized by
diﬀerent cone apertures under which the stars are seen. In table 1 we exhibit some numerical examples
expressing this feature.

Table 1: Dependence of the aperture on the observation angle θ(n) using q = 0.99. The aperture is
monotonically increasing as the angles grow in absolute value. The states used to obtain these results
are constructed numerically in appendix B. For consistency, the aperture for 180◦is not truncated at
ﬁrst order in (1 −q) as in (18), but is computed numerically with eq. (15) with q = 0.99.
From this analysis, it is worth noticing that the fuzziness grows as our quantized Euler angle
increases, resulting in a starry sky inferred by Alice, similar to what is depicted in ﬁg. 2. Of course,
the analysis can also be repeated for Bob, who chooses a diﬀerent z-axis, in principle, and observes the
same stars as Alice. The states describing the relative orientation between these stars and his z-axis
will be diﬀerent from the ones characterizing Alice’s frame. The degree of fuzziness he observes for a
particular star will be diﬀerent from the one assigned to it by Alice, resulting in a diﬀerent inference
of the starry sky, as shown in ﬁg. 2.

Conclusions
In this work, we have given a physical interpretation of the SUq(2) quantum group and, from the prop-
erties of its representations, derived a framework in which one of the Euler angles becomes quantized
and reference frames exhibit fuzziness properties.
The nature of this fuzziness is distinct from the one usually associated with quantum references
frames (QRFs) [24–32], which arises describing the frame itself as an ordinary quantum system. The
key diﬀerence is the source of the frame fuzziness: for QRFs it is governed by Planck’s constant ℏand
follows from the standard laws of quantum mechanics, while in our scenario it is the deformation of
spatial rotations, governed by the parameter q, that produces the fuzziness. Accordingly, the states
encoding the fuzziness are associated with physical systems (including the frame) in the context of
QRFs, while here they describe the relation between two frames. QRFs can be in relative superposition,
however, the transformations between them act on the states of the physical systems directly, without
being described by a quantum state of their own.
Classically, all observers can objectively reconstruct the sky. In our work, they are agents: using
quantum rotations, they reconstruct their own version of the sky based on their choices of the z-axis
and there is no operational procedure they can use to reconstruct it objectively. In fact, even if they
were to exchange their data, they would need to q-rotate it in their coordinates, inevitably introducing
the intrinsic uncertainty predicted by the SUq(2) model. This feature can be paramount in developing
a new paradigm of physics in which agents cannot be subtracted from the Universe they observe.
The next step in this program would be to develop a fully relativistic and relational picture. To do
so, we should ﬁrst consider the case in which more observers are involved, understanding which states
can describe the composition of deformed rotations. Then the framework should be extended to the
translations and boosts sectors.
The full quantum regime should also be investigated. In our present work, we focused on a semi-
classical regime, in which the expectation values and the variances of the q-deformed rotation matrix
act on classical vectors, to derive some novel qualitative properties. This is a crucial step toward a
description of a q-deformed version of the alignment procedure described in appendix C. To go further,
we need a more developed characterization of physical objects like spinors/qubits and Stern-Gerlach
apparata, as well as a consistent interpretational framework for such “quantum mechanics on a quantum
7

space(time)”. In particular, we would need a description of qubits in a world in which rotations are
described by SUq(2), and this would require facing several open questions: Is it consistent to just assume
that the standard 1-qubit Hilbert space describes the spins that Alice sends to Bob? Or does consistency
require generalizing the notion of spinors to some noncommutative objects (e.g., see [33])? What does
the measurement procedure do to the state of the system? Is the relative orientation of Alice’s and Bob’s
laboratories changed by their gaining information about each other while exchanging spins? Or is a
quantum spacetime described by SUq(2) rotations a suﬃciently mild deformation of classical spacetime
that it still guarantees that two observers can study their relative orientation without changing it?
Besides their conceptual interest, investigating these possibilities might open a path [34,35] towards
much-needed experimental tests, which in turn could guide further theoretical development of quantum
gravity.

A
Classical SU(2) parametrization and quantization ambiguity
The SU(2) group is deﬁned as the group of 2 × 2 unitary matrices with determinant equal to 1. A
generic element U ∈SU(2) can be parametrized as
U =
a
−c∗
c
a∗

,
(19)
where a and c are two complex numbers satisfying
aa∗+ cc∗= 1 ,
(20)
constraining the degrees of freedom to three real numbers. A commonly used parametrization for a
and c in terms of three real numbers is
a = eiη cos θ
2
c = eiδ sin θ
2 ,
(21)
with η, δ ∈[0, 2π) and θ ∈[0, π). These three angles encode all the information needed to uniquely
identify an SU(2) element and are useful in identifying the connection of SU(2) to the rotation group
SO(3). Indeed, the canonical homomorphism between the two groups is realized via
Rij = 1
2 Tr

σi U σj U †	
≡1
2 Tr

U σj U † σi
	
,
(22)
where Rij is a rotation matrix, U is parametrized as in (19) and σi are the Hermitian Pauli matrices.
Writing (22) explicitly, we have
R =


1
2(a2 −c2 + (a∗)2 −(c∗)2)
i
2(−a2 + c2 + (a∗)2 −(c∗)2)
(a∗c + c∗a)
i
2(a2 + c2 −(a∗)2 −(c∗)2)
1
2(a2 + c2 + (a∗)2 + (c∗)2)
−i(a∗c −c∗a)
−(ac + c∗a∗)
i(ac −c∗a∗)
1 −2cc∗

.
(23)
As anticipated in the results section, matrix (4) indeed coincides with this classical one in the q →1
limit.
Inserting parametrization (21) in (23) we obtain the rotation matrix in terms of trigonometric
functions of the three real angles η, δ and θ. These are simply a redeﬁnition of the well known Euler
angles (α, β, γ)
θ = β
η = α + γ
2
δ = π
2 −α −γ
2
.
(24)
In terms of these, a generic rotation matrix is written as R(α, β, γ) = Rz(α)Rx(β)Rz(γ), where Rz and
Rx are rotations around the z-axis and x-axis respectively.
In the quantization procedure, we replace the classical U with the deformed Uq in (23), thus replac-
ing the complex numbers a and c with the operators satisfying (1), and we leave the Pauli matrices
untouched. It may be argued that a deformation of the Pauli matrices, such as the one studied in [33],
should be considered here. However, doing so leads to non-hermitian operators for the entries of the
resulting matrix. With our choice, not only do we get hermitian operators, but we reconstruct a matrix
that matches the one obtained in [23] upon doing a change of basis, and this guarantees that we obtain
a representation of SOq(3) as explained shortly.
To discuss our results we used matrix (4) which is obtained with the ﬁrst ordering in (22). Due to
the noncommutative nature of operators a and c, the cyclic property of the trace, expressed in (22)
is not valid anymore. This leads to two possible deﬁnitions of the quantum rotation matrix. The
alternative to (4), obtained using the second ordering in (22), is
Pq =


1
2(a2 −qc2 + (a∗)2 −q(c∗)2)
i
2(−a2 + qc2 + (a∗)2 −q(c∗)2)
q(a∗c + c∗a)
i
2(a2 + qc2 −(a∗)2 −q(c∗)2)
1
2(a2 + qc2 + (a∗)2 + q(c∗)2)
−iq(a∗c −c∗a)
−1+q2
2q (ac + c∗a∗)
i 1+q2
2q (ac −c∗a∗)
1 −(1 + q2)cc∗

.
(25)
It turns out that Pq and Rq are actually similar matrices: Rq = MPqM −1, with
M =





1
3 (
q
1+q2 )

This matrix (with its inverse) reduces to the identity at ﬁrst order in (1 −q) so that the two matrices
are equivalent from a phenomenological point of view. Indeed, since the quantum-gravity expectation
is that q is extremely close to 1, the search for experimental manifestations of our q-deformation is
not likely to ever go beyond the leading (1 −q)-order eﬀects [34]. Notice that the two matrices come
from an ambiguity of the “quantization procedure”, namely the ordering of the matrices in (22). This
is similar to what happens in standard quantum mechanics where diﬀerent orderings in the classical
observables give rise to diﬀerent quantum operators which give the same classical limits.
Furthermore, the link with the quantum group SOq(3) is established as follows. The vector (co)-
representation of SUq(2) is linked to the (co)-representation of the quantum group SOq(3) via the
isomorphism C(SOq(3)) := C(SUq(2)/Z2); the representation reads [23]
d1 =


(a∗)2
−(1 + q2)a∗c
−qc2
c∗a∗
1 −(1 + q2)c∗c
ac
−q(c∗)2
−(1 + q2)c∗a
a2

.
(27)
In the commutative limit, this matrix approaches a generic rotation matrix written in the so-called
complex basis, and can be rewritten in the Cartesian basis by a similarity transformation, with
N =


−1
−i
0
0
0
1
−1
i
0


(28)
acting as the change of basis. By applying this transformation in the q-deformed case too, one can
easily check that N −1d1N is identically equal to (4). This clariﬁes the link to the SOq(3) quantum
group. Matrices Pq and Rq are (co)-representations of SOq(3) since they can be obtained by a similarity
transformation from (27). Therefore, our ansatz (3) realizes the quantum version of the SU(2) to SO(3)
homomorphism.
In closing this section, we oﬀer some comments on another quantization ambiguity, concerning our
deﬁnition of the angle θ(n) in (10). There we obtained the deﬁnition of sin

θ(n)
2

by comparing the
eigenvalues of π(c) to the classical parametrization of c in (8). We ﬁnd that this is consistent with the
deﬁnition of cos

θ(n)
2

in terms of π(a∗a), which also acts diagonally. Indeed, on a generic eigenstate
|n, φ, χ⟩(cf. (7)) one has that
π(a∗a) |n, φ, χ⟩= (1 −q2n) |n, φ, χ⟩= cos2
θ(n)
2

|n, φ, χ⟩.
(29)
Furthermore, this is in agreement with the fact that a∗a + c∗c = 1, as can be inferred from (1).
Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that since a and a∗do not commute (see (1)), one could obtain another
result for θ(n) upon deﬁning its cosine in terms of π(aa∗), which also acts diagonally (cf. (7)), rather
than π(a∗a). As one can easily check, this would lead to allowed values of θ which are the same as in
our π(a∗a) case, with the only diﬀerence that θ = π would be missing from the spectrum of θ(n). With
this ordering we would have sin

θ(n)
2

= qn+1 which is merely a shift of n with respect to the ordering
we adopted. Evidently, the main results and the main aspects of physical interpretation of our analysis
are unaﬀected by this quantization ambiguity.
B
Numerical construction of semi-classical states
In order to construct the semi-classical states, we have resorted to numerical computations, focusing
on the case q = 0.99 as illustrative example. However, by increasing the value of q, we have checked
that the below states satisfy the condition (11), thus approximating classical rotations with increasing
precision.
We will focus on the (y, z)-plane setting χ = 0, φ =
π
2 , as can be seen from (24).
We want
to construct states that semi-classically describe a deformed rotation of a certain angle in this plane.
Since n deﬁnes the only angle left, θ, we choose to build superpositions (12) centered on particular values
of n, dubbed ¯n, with coeﬃcients cn multiplying the states |n, φ, χ⟩rapidly decreasing as θ(n) deviates
from θ(¯n). Our ansatz is that these coeﬃcients have the form of a discretized Gaussian distribution.
The variance is then chosen in the following way. Recalling that
θ(n) = 2 arcsin qn
(30)
11

we can deﬁne ∆¯n as
∆¯n := dn
dθ

θ(¯n)∆θ .
(31)
We take ∆θ = π
2 −arcsin q, which is just half of the value of the maximum angular deviation and weigh
it with the rate of change of n with respect to θ, approximated as the derivative. Therefore, the value
of the variance depends on the central value ¯n. This approximation becomes more and more accurate
with increasing values of n for which θ(n) becomes quasi-continuous.
We then deﬁne our superposition coeﬃcients cn as
cn =
e−(¯n−n)2
2∆¯n2
P∞
n=0 e−(¯n−n)2
2∆¯n2
.
(32)
For computational reasons, we do not consider the full superposition going from n = 0 to n = ∞but
we truncate the series by considering the 3-σ range of our Gaussian. Namely, the sum goes from nmin
to nmax, where
nmin −¯n = −3∆¯n
nmax −¯n = 3∆¯n .
(33)
For relatively small values of ¯n, the value for nmin might be negative when considering the 3-σ range.
When this happens, we simply truncate the Gaussian and start the series from n = 0. We have explicitly
veriﬁed that this doesn’t aﬀect our results in a signiﬁcant way.
We have used this algorithm to construct the states used for the numerical analysis of table 1. In
what follows, we show the results for the computation of the expectation values of the matrix elements
(Rq)ij with their relative uncertainties for states centered around n = 95, 34, 7, 0, corresponding to
angles θ = 45.275◦, 90.560◦, 137.518◦, θ = 180◦.

To obtain the states describing q-deformations of rotations of negative angles ζ < 0, we just have to
consider the same states but with φ = −π
2 . It is straightforward to show that for states of the form
(12) with χ = 0 having real superposition coeﬃcients like (32), the map φ 7→−φ exchanges (Rq)23 with
(Rq)32, leaving all the other elements unchanged, and yields the same uncertainty matrix. Therefore
the aperture of the cone in table 1 is the same for opposite angles.
For the θ = 0 case, we use the state in the representation ρ which gives the identity matrix in
computing the expectation values which is simply given by |χ = 0⟩∈Hρ. From (9) we thus have
⟨ψ(0◦)|Rq|ψ(0◦)⟩= 13×3
∆Rq = 0003×3 .

C
Quantum protocol for the alignment of reference frames in
classical space
Let us illustrate a simple (but not necessarily most eﬃcient) protocol for two agents, who reside in a
classical Euclidean spatial environment, but do not share a classical reference frame, to synchronize
their spatial orientations by communicating qubits, i.e. SU(2) spinors. It is desirable to extend this
protocol to the quantum group SUq(2), however, we leave this for future research as it requires a
better understanding of multi-qubit states and sequential rotations in the presence of the symmetry
deformation.
C.1
Qubits as SU(2) spinors in standard quantum theory
It is well-known that any single qubit state, represented as a density matrix ρ, can be expanded in the
basis of the identity 1 and Hermitian Pauli matrices σi as
ρ = 1
2(1 + ⃗r · ⃗σ) ,
(39)
where the expectation values of the spin observables give the components of the Bloch vector:
ri = ⟨σi⟩= Tr {ρ σi} .
(40)
The latter relation holds since the Pauli matrices form an orthonormal basis
Tr {σµ σν} = 2 δµν ,
(41)
where σ0 := 1. As such, we can also deﬁne a 4-dimensional Bloch vector
rµ = Tr {ρ σµ}
(42)
whose zero-component
r0 = Tr ρ = 1
(43)
is simply the normalization of the state.
Consider now an SU(2) transformation of the quantum state. As it turns out, the density matrix
(39) decomposes into an SU(2)-invariant singlet and an SU(2)-covariant triplet term, since for any
matrix U ∈SU(2),
ρ →U ρ U † = 1
2(1 + ⃗r · U ⃗σ U †) = 1
2(1 + ⃗r′ · ⃗σ) ,
(44)
where now the transformed Bloch vector is
⃗r′ = R · ⃗r
(45)
with
Rij = 1
2 Tr

Uσj U † σi
	
(46)
an element of PSU(2) ≃SO(3). In other words, if the quantum state is transformed by an SU(2)
matrix, the Bloch vector ⃗r that represents it transforms like a 3-dimensional vector under spatial
rotations.
Clearly, the phase of the SU(2) transformations is cancelled and the adjoint action of SU(2) yields
a spatial rotation in its fundamental representation. Hence, the normalization r0 is an SU(2)-invariant,
13

Figure 3: Alice (on the left) prepares a set of N qubits (e.g., electron spins) in the spin-up eigenstate
of her x axis (e.g., by passing unpolarized electrons through a x-oriented Stern–Gerlach apparatus,
and selecting only the ones that emerge with their spins up). She then sends these electrons to Bob,
whose laboratory is rotated by an unknown amount with respect to hers. Bob divides these N qubits
in three groups, and sends each group through a machine that measures the spin along one of his
three orthogonal axes (e.g., three perpendicular Stern–Gerlach apparata - in the picture, he is passing
the electrons through a y-oriented machine). He then counts the number of spin-up and spin-down
measurements that each machine reads, and calculates the expectation value of the corresponding
observable. Repeating the experiment for a set of N qubits that Alice selected to be polarized along
the y−, and, respectively, z−axes allows Bob to build a statistics of the expectation values of the nine
observables associated to each pair of choices of axes made by him and Alice. In the large-N limit,
these expectation values tend to the nine components of the rotation matrix R that connects Alice’s
reference frame and Bob’s. Notice that, in this illustrative picture the electron beams (in orange) are
manipulated with some ”mirrors” (the black cylinders) which are assumed not to have any eﬀect on
the qubit states.
while ⃗r transforms in the adjoint representation of SU(2) and thus under the fundamental representation
of SO(3).
In this manner, we can associate to every SU(2) transformation of states or spin observables an
SO(3) spatial rotation. In particular, we can write the same qubit state relative to diﬀerent bases of
Pauli matrices U ⃗σ U † by simply rotating the corresponding Bloch vector accordingly,
⃗r′ρ = Tr

ρ U ⃗σ U †	
= R−1 · ⃗rρ = R−1 · Tr {ρ⃗σ} ,
(47)
where ⃗r′ρ and ⃗rρ are both Bloch vectors of the same quantum state ρ, however, written relative
to diﬀerent observable bases. Interpreting U ⃗σ U † and ⃗σ as being the observables corresponding to
diﬀerently oriented sets of Stern-Gerlach devices in the lab, this rewriting allows us to express how
observers with diﬀerent spatially oriented reference frames will ‘see’ the same quantum state of (possibly
an ensemble of) a qubit.
C.2
Alignment protocol between two laboratories by exchanging qubits
Suppose that Alice and Bob have never met before and thus do not know how their reference frames
are aligned with respect to each other. Supposing further that they can communicate classically, they
can proceed as follows in order to ﬁgure out the relation between their descriptions. Alice prepares
14

three ensembles of qubits, each prepared such that the ensemble state corresponds to a Bloch sphere
basis vector. For example, she could prepare three ensembles of N qubits each so that

i.e., every qubit of the ﬁrst ensemble is prepared to be in the ‘up in xA-direction’ pure state, where
xA is Alice’s x-direction, and similarly for the other two ensembles. Alice can then send Bob these
three ensembles to perform state tomography on them. Bob could proceed as follows: he divides each
ensemble in three subensembles and measures all qubits of the ﬁrst subensemble with a Stern-Gerlach
(SG) device oriented in xB-direction, of the second in yB-direction and of the third in zB-direction.
This will tell him how to write Alice’s states relative to his basis and, via (47), what the relative SO(3)
rotation between their spatial frames is. For example, relative to Alice, the ensemble state of ExA
appears as
ρxA = 1
2(1 + ⃗rxA · ⃗σA) = 1
2(1 + σxA) .
(49)
Suppose now that Bob’s measurement apparata are in the following relation with Alice’s: ⃗σA =
U ⃗σB U †. Then, using (47), we can write the same ensemble state, but now relative to Bob as
ρxA = 1
2
 1 + ⃗rxA · U ⃗
σB U †
= 1
2(1 + ⃗rxB · ⃗σB) ,
(50)
where
⃗rxB = R · ⃗rxA
(51)
and

(52)
which is equivalent to (46) if we remember that U are unitary matrices.
Bob can measure ⃗rxB =
Tr {ρxA⃗σB} using tomography on ExA, which is why he has to split that ensemble into three subensem-
bles to measure its qubits relative to a basis of SG devices.
Proceeding this ways also with EyA, EzA, Bob can ﬁgure out the Bloch vector basis ⃗rxB,⃗ryB,⃗rzB
of Alice’s ensemble states relative to his frame and if Alice also tells him how she describes the same
states, namely as ⃗rxA,⃗ryA,⃗rzA, then they can simply compute R from the relation of these two sets of
bases. In principle, Bob has to perform an inﬁnite number of measurements to determine the rotation
matrix connecting his reference frame with Alice’s with arbitrary precision. From this, the matrix (23)
admits a direct, operational interpretation in terms of (52): it is the matrix of the asymptotic N →∞
values of the averages of the spin measurements that Bob performs on the qubit states sent to him by
Alice.

Representation ρ as limit of representation π
By adding a phase to the representation π discussed in the mathematical literature [20] we have
ρ(a) |χ⟩= eiχ |χ⟩
ρ(a∗) |χ⟩= e−iχ |χ⟩
ρ(c) |χ⟩= ρ(c∗) |χ⟩= 0

with our deﬁnition of quantized angle, θ(n) = 2 arcsin qn. Looking at (53) and (54), it may seem that
we have four Euler angles in the representations of SUq(2), namely the aforementioned (χ, ϵ, φ, θ(n)).
This is a subtlety solved by observing that, with the additional ϵ phase that we introduced in the
π-representation, the representation ρ can be obtained as a somewhat trivial limit of representation
π. Therefore, we have three physical degrees of freedom, with the angles χ and ϵ linked by this limit
operation, so that we can ultimately set ϵ = χ.
15

To see this, we need to ﬁnd a class of states such that
π(a) |ψ(χ)⟩→eiχ |ψ(χ)⟩
,
π(c) |ψ(χ)⟩→0
(55)
in this limit. We can show that states of the type (with the identiﬁcation ϵ = χ)
|ψn⟩=

from the π-representation satisfy requirement (55) for n →∞.
In fact, for the operator c we can immediately see that
π(c) |ψn⟩= eiφ

To show that the limit π(a) |ψn⟩→eiχ |ψ⟩holds we will show that the succession of the norms of the

This observation that representation π converges for certain states to representation ρ can be ex-
tended to generic functions of operators. In general, such functions can be written as a sum of powers
of the operators π(a), π(a∗), π(c) and π(c∗). We now prove that these functions acting on a class of
states in representation π give, in a certain limit, the value that the same function yields in the limit
of these sates with π(a) replaced by ρ(a) and so on.
In order to do so, we consider a slightly diﬀerent class of states than the one in (56). In particular
we consider
|Ψn⟩=
1
√
n! + 1
2n!
X
k=n!
|k, φ, χ⟩.
(62)
The reason why we make this choice with the factorial will be clear in the following.
Consider ﬁrst the case in which we have an operator of the form π(c)mπ(a)l. If we act with this
operator on the state (62) and we compute the norm of the state obtained in this way we get
0 ≤⟨Ψn|π(a∗)lπ(c∗)mπ(c)mπ(a)l|Ψn⟩≤
q2m(n!−l)h
1 −q2m(n!+1)i
(1 −q2m)(n! + 1)
n→∞
−−−−→
m̸=0
0 .
(63)
The same argument holds if we have only powers of the operator π(c) (i.e, l = 0) or other combinations
involving π(a∗), π(c∗) and diﬀerent orderings. The case with m = 0, in which the limit above is 1,
corresponds to a power of π(a) which will be handled slightly diﬀerently in the following.
Now we turn to powers of the operator π(a), i.e π(a)m. We do something analogous to the argument
used for π(a), namely we deﬁne the diﬀerence state
16

|Ψ′
n⟩= π(a)m |Ψn⟩−eimχ |Ψn⟩

and show its norm goes to zero as n →∞. After some algebraic manipulations, this norm is found to

is the q-Pochhammer symbol. The result of the limit comes
from the fact that the term in the square brackets above is essentially just a sum of powers of q.
We have thus shown that a generic function of π(a) and π(c) operators applied to (a class of) states
in the π representation converges to the same function applied to a state in ρ representation (a similar
argument holds for functions of π(a∗) and π(c∗) operators). The reason why we considered a state of
the form (62) is now clear: it is necessary to have a number of states in the superposition which goes
to inﬁnity faster than m does in order to properly do the limit when considering generic functions, in
which case we have a series in m.
The states (56) can be used also to show directly for the vectorial (co)-representation that it is
possible to obtain the rotations about the z-axis as a limit in the representation π. In the same way, it
is possible to obtain the identity, i.e. the null rotation, in the same representation.
To obtain a rotation about the z-axis, we must have φ = 0 and we have to consider the large n
limit. In this limit, setting φ = 0, we can approximate our π representation as
π(a) |n, φ, χ⟩= eiχ |n −1, φ, χ⟩
π(c) = π(c∗) = 0
π(a∗) |n, φ, χ⟩= e−iχ |n + 1, φ, χ⟩.
(66)
Therefore, using the states (56), we obtain
⟨ψ|Rq|ψ⟩=


−1+n
1+n cos χ
−1+n
1+n sin χ
0
−−1+n
1+n sin χ
−1+n
1+n cos χ


.
(67)
In the large n limit, we see that (67) approximates a rotation matrix about the z-axis with greater and
greater precision and it can be shown that the variances are equal to 0. Moreover, χ = 0 in (67) gives
the identity matrix in the large n limit.
