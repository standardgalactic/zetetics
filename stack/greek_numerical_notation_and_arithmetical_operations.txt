GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION AND ARITH-
METICAL OPERATIONS
The decimal system.
THE Greeks, from the earliest historical times, followed the
decimal system of numeration, which had already been
adopted by civilized peopled all the world over. There are,
it is true, traces of quinary reckoning (reckoning in terms of
five) in very early times ; thus in Homer Treinrdgeiv (to 'five')
is used for (to count \l 
But the counting by fives was pro-
bably little more than auxiliary to counting by tens; five was
a natural halting-place between the unit and ten, and the use
of five times a particular power of ten as a separate category
intermediate between that power and the next was found
convenient in the earliest form of numerical symbolism estab-
lished in Greece, just as it was in the Roman arithmetical
notation. The reckoning by five does not amount to such a
variation of the decimal system as that which was in use
among the Celts and Danes; these peoples had a vigesimal
system, traces of which are still left in the French quatre-
vingts, quatre-vingt-treize, &c, and in our score, three-score
and ten, twenty-one, &c.
The natural explanation of the origin of the decimal system,
as well as of the quinary and vigesimal variations, is to
suppose that they were suggested by the primitive practice of
reckoning with the fingers, first of one hand, then of both
together, and after that with the ten toes in addition (making
up the 20 of the vigesimal system). The subject was mooted
in the Aristotelian Problems,2 where it is asked:
' Why do all men, whether barbarians or Greeks, count up
to ten, and not up to any other number, such as 2, 3, 4, or 5,
so that, for example, they do not say one-pZus-five (for 6),

two-^Zus-five (for 7), as they say one-plus-bm (evSeica, for 11),
two-£>Zws-ten (SwSeKa, for 12), while on the other hand they
do not go beyond ten for the first halting-place from'which to
start again repeating the units ? For of course any number
is the next before it plus 1, or the next before that plus 2,
and so with those preceding numbers ; yet men fixed definitely
on ten as the number to count up to. It cannot have been
chance; for chance will not account for the same thing being
done always: what is always and universally done is not due
to chance but to some natural cause/
Then, after some fanciful suggestions (e.g. that 10 is a
' perfect number'), the author proceeds:
' Or is it because men were born with ten fingers and so,
because they possess the equivalent of pebbles to the number
of their own fingers, come to use this number for counting
everything else as well ?'
Evidence for the truth of this latter view is forthcoming in
the number of cases where the word for 5 is either the same
as, or connected with, the word for ' hand \ 
Both the Greek
yelp and the Latin manus are used to denote ' a numberJ (of
men). The author of the so-called geometry of Boetius says,
moreover, that the ancients called all the numbers "below ten
by the name digits (' fingers ').1
Before entering on a description of the Greek numeral signs
it is proper to refer briefly to the systems of notation used
by their forerunners in civilization, the Egyptians and
Babylonians.
Egyptian numerical notation.
The Egyptians had a purely decimal system, with the signs
I for the unit, PI for 10, @ for 100, f for 1,000, "] for 10,000,
"^=£ for 100,000. The number of each denomination was
expressed by repeating the sign that number of times; when
the number was more than 4 or 5, lateral space was saved by
arranging them in two or three rows, one above the other.
The greater denomination came before the smaller. Numbers
could be written from left to right or from right to left; in
the latter case the above signs were turned the opposite way.
The fractions in use were all submultiples or single aliquot

submultiples were denoted by writing <cz> over the corre-
sponding whole number; thus

Babylonian systems,
(a) Decimal. 
(13) Sexagesimal.
The ancient Babylonians had two systems of numeration.
The one was purely decimal based on the following signs.
The simple wedge J represented the unit, which was repeated
up to nine times: where there were more than three, they
were placed in two Or three rows, e.g. ^ = 4, J^ = 7. 10
was represented by ^; 11 would therefore be ^Y . 100 had
the compound sign J>~, and 1000 was expressed as 10 hun-
dreds, by 4J>~, the prefixed ^ (10) being here multiplicative.
Similarly the {J>- was regarded as one sign, and ^^|*- de-
noted not 2000 but 10000, the prefixed \ being again multi-
plicative. 
Multiples of 10000 seem to have been expressed
as multiples of 1000; at least, 120000 seems to be attested
in the form 100.1000 + 20.1000. The absence of any definite
unit above 1000 (if it was really absent) must have rendered
the system very inconvenient as a means of expressing large
numbers.
Much more interesting is the second Babylonian system,
the sexagesimal. This is found in use on the Tables of
Senkereh, discovered by W. K. Loftus in 1854, which may go
back as far as the time between 2300 and 1600 B.C. In this
system numbers above the units (which go from 1 to 59) are
arranged according to powers of 60. 
60 itself was called
sussiu ( = soss), 602 was called sar, and there was a name also
(Tier) for the intermediate number 10.60 = 600. The multi-
ples of the several powers of 60, 602, 603, &c, contained in the
number to be written down were expressed by means of the
same wedge-notation as served for the units, and the multi-
ples were placed in columns side by side, the columns being
appropriated to the successive powers of 60. The unit-term

was followed by similar columns appropriated, in order, to the
successive submultiples —, —2> &c, the number of sixtieths,
&c, being again denoted by the ordinary wedge-numbers.
Thus ^ p

larly we find ^ ^ (£( representing 30 + |g and ^ ^ KKKI^TT
representing 30 + §§; the latter case also shows that the
Babylonians, on occasion, used the subtractive plan, for the 27
is here written 30 minus 3.
The sexagesimal system only required a definite symbol
for 0 (indicating the absence of a particular denomination),
and a fixed arrangement of columns3 to become a complete
position-value system like the Indian. With a sexagesimal
system 0 would occur comparatively seldom, and the Tables of
Senkereh do not show a case; but from other sources it
appears that a gap often indicated a zero, or there was a sign
used for the purpose, namely i, called the 'divider*. The
inconvenience of the system was that it required a multipli-
cation table extending from 1 times 1 to 59 times 59. It had,
however, the advantage that it furnished an easy means of
expressing very large numbers. The researches of H. V.
Hilprecht show that 604 = 12,960,000 played a prominent
part in Babylonian arithmetic, and he found a table con-
taining certain quotients of the number |^
= 608+10.607, or 195,955,200,000,000. Since the number 9f
units of any denomination are expressed in the purely decimal
notation, it follows that the latter system preceded the sexa-
gesimal. 
What circumstances led to the adoption of 60 as
the base can only be conjectured, but it may be presumed that
the authors of the system were fully alive to the convenience
of a base with so many divisors, combining as it does the
advantages of 12 and 10.
Greek numerical notation.
To return to the Greeks. We find, in Greek inscriptions of
all dates, instances of numbers and values written out in full;
but the inconvenience of this longhand, especially in such
things as accounts, would soon be felt, and efforts would be
made to devise a scheme for representing numbers more

GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
concisely by means of conventional signs of some sort. The
Greeks conceived the original idea of using the letters of the
ordinary Greek alphabet for this purpose.
(a) The i Herodianic' signs.
There were two main systems of numerical notation in use in
classical times. The first, known as the Attic system and
used for cardinal numbers exclusively, consists of the set of
signs somewhat absurdly called ' Herodianic' because they are
described in a fragment1 attributed to Herodian, a gram-
marian of the latter half of the second century A.D. The
authenticity of the fragment is questioned, but the writer
says that he has seen the signs used in Solon's laws, where
the prescribed pecuniary fines were stated in this notation,
and that they are also to be found in various ancient inscrip-
tions, decrees and laws. 
These signs cannot claim to be
numerals in the proper sense; they are mere compendia or
abbreviations; for, except in the case of the stroke I repre-
senting a unit, the signs are the first letters of the full words
for the numbers, and all numbers up to 50000 were repre-
sented by combinations of these signs. 
I, representing the
unit, may be repeated up to four times ; P (the first letter of
nivTe) stands for 5, A (the first letter of 8£ica) for 10, H
(representing e/caroy) for 100, X (^LXLOL) for 1000, and M
(fivpLoi) for 10000. 
The half-way numbers 50, 500, 5000
were expressed by combining P (five) with the other signs
respectively; P, F3, P, made up of P (5) and A (10), = 50;
P, made up of P and H, = 500; F =5000; and |™ = 50000.
There are thus six simple and four compound symbols, and all
other numbers intermediate between those so represented are
made up by juxtaposition on an additive basis, so that each
of the simple signs may be repeated not more than four times;
the higher numbers come before the lower. For example,
PI = 6, ANN = 14, HP = 105, XXXXPHHHHP AAAAPl 111
= 4999. Instances of this system of notation are found in
Attic inscriptions from 454 to about 95 B.C. Outside Attica
the same system was in use, the precise form of the symbols
varying with the form of the letters in the local alphabets.
Thus in Boeotian inscriptions P or f = 50, HE = 100, [>E =^500,

THE 'HERODIANIC SIGNS 
31
V = 1000, >p=5000; and fYl£hEhEf-EI>>l!l = 5823. But,
in consequence of the political influence of Athens, the Attic
system, sometimes with unimportant modifications, spread to
other states.1
In a similar manner compendia were used to denote units
of coinage or of weight. Thus in Attica l^rdXavrov 
(6000
drachmae), M = [ivd (1000 drachmae), Z or $ =
(l/3000th of a talent or 2 drachmae), h = Spaxprj, I = o
(l/6th of a drachma), C = ruiitofikXiov (l/l2th of a drachma),
3 or T = rerapTTjfiopioi/ (l/4th of an obol or 1/24th of a
drachma), X = xa^Kov$ (l/8th of an obol or l/48th of a
drachma). Where a number of one of these units has to be
expressed, the sign for the unit is written on the left of that
for the number; thus hPAl = 61 drachmae. The two com-
pendia for the numeral and the unit are often combined into
one ; e.g. p, F1 = 5 talents, p1 = 50 talents, H = 100 talents,
r R= 500 talents, £ = 1000 talents, A = 10 minas, F = 5 drach-
mae, ^ , A , ^ = 10 staters, &c.
(/8) The ordinary alphabetic numerals.
The second main system, used for all kinds of numerals, is
that with which we are familiar, namely the alphabetic
system. 
The Greeks took their alphabet from the Phoe-
nicians. The Phoenician alphabet contained 22 letters, and,
in appropriating the different signs, the Greeks had the
happy inspiration to use for the vowels, which were not
written in Phoenician, the signs for certain spirants for which
the Greeks had no use; Aleph became A, He was used for E,
Yod for I, and Ayin for O; when, later, the long E was
differentiated, Cheth was used, B or H. Similarly they
utilized superfluous signs for sibilants. Out of Zayin and
Samech they made the letters Z and E. 
The remaining two
sibilants were Ssade and Shin. From the latter came the
simple Greek 2 (although the name Sigma seems to corre-
spond to the Semitic Samech, if it is not simply the ' hissing'
letter, from o-i£oo). Ssade, a softer sibilant ( = O-(T), also called
San in early times, was taken over by the Greeks in the
place it occupied after IT, and written in the form M or v\.
The form T (=<nr) appearing in inscriptions of Halicarnassus

GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
(e.g. 'AXiKapj/aTlecov] = tA\iKapva£it<*)v) andTeos
cf. Oakaiiav in another place) seems to be derived from some
form of Ssade; this T, after its disappearance from the
literary alphabet, remained as a numeral, passing through
the forms A, m, P\ en, and *p to the fifteenth century form 
\
to which in the second half of the seventeenth century the
name Sampi was applied (whether as being the San which
followed Pi or from its resemblance to the cursive form of TT).
The original Greek alphabet also retained the Phoenician Vau(f)
in its proper place between E and Z and the Koppa=Qoph (9)
immediately before P. The Phoenician alphabet ended with
T; the Greeks first added T, derived from Vau apparently
(notwithstanding the retention of F), then the letters 3>, X, 9
and, still later, 12. The 27 letters used for numerals are
divided into three sets of nine each; the first nine denote
the units, 1, 2, 3, &c, up to 9; the second nine the tens, from
10 to 90; and the third nine the hundreds* from 100 to 900.
The following is the scheme :
A 
= 1 
I = 10
B 
= 2 
K = 20
T 
= 3 
A = 30
A 
= 4 
M = 40
E 
= 5 
N = 50
C [<r] = 6 
Z = 60
Z 
=7 
O = 70
H 
= 8 
n = so
0 = 9 
0 = 90 
p ]
The sixth sign in the first column (C) is a form of the
digamma F F. It came, in the seventh and eighth centuries
A. D., to be written in the form (J and then, from its similarity
to the cursive 9 (= or), was called Stigma.
This use of the letters of the alphabet as numerals was
original with the Greeks; they did not derive it from the
Phoenicians, who never used their alphabet for numerical
purposes but had separate signs for numbers. The earliest
occurrence of numerals written in this way appears to be in
a Halicarnassian inscription of date not long after 450 B.C.
Two caskets from the ruins of a famous mausoleum built at
Halicarnassus in 351 B.C., which are attributed to the time
of Mausolus, about 350 B.C., are inscribed with the letters

*NA = 754 and SQT = 293. A list of priests of Poseidon
at Halicarnassus, attributable to a date at least as early as the
fourth century, is preserved in a copy of the second or first
century, and this copy, in which the numbers were no doubt
reproduced from the original list, has the terms of office of the
several priests stated on the alphabetical system. Again, a
stone inscription found at Athens and perhaps belonging to
the middle of the fourth century B.C. has, in five fragments
of columns, numbers in tens and units Expressed on the same
system, the tens on the right and the units on the left.
There is a difference of opinion as to the approximate date
of the actual formulation of the alphabetical system of
numerals. According to one view, that of Larfeld, it must
have been introduced much earlier than the date (450 B.C. or
a little later) of the Halicarnassus inscription, in fact as early
as the end of the eighth century, the place of its origin being
Miletus. The argument is briefly this. At the time of the
invention of the system all the letters from A to H; including
F and 9 in their proper places, were still in use, while
Ssade (T, the double>ss) had dropped out; this is why the
last-named sign (afterwards ~^) was put at the end. 
If
C (= 6) and 9 (= 90) had been no longer in use as letters,
they too would have been put, like Ssade, at the end. The
place of origin of the numeral system must have been one in
which the current alphabet corresponded to the content and
order of the alphabetic numerals. 
The order of the signs
<!>, X, y shows that it was one of the Eastern group of
alphabets. 
These conditions are satisfied by one alphabet,
and one only, that of Miletus, at a stage which still recognized
the Vau (F) as well as the Koppa (9). The 9 is found along
with the so-called complementary letters including fl, the
latest of all, in the oldest inscriptions of the Milesian colony
Naucratis (about 650 B.C.); and, although there are no
extant Milesian inscriptions containing the F, there is at all
events one very early example of F in Ionic, namely !Aya-
o-iXeFo ('AyacnXrjFov) on a vase in the Boston (U.S.) Museum
of Fine Arts belonging to the end of the eighth or (at latest)
the middle of the seventh century. 
Now, as £1 is fully
established at the date of the earliest inscriptions at Miletus
(about 700 B.C.) and Naucratis (about 650 B.C.), the earlier

GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
extension of the alphabet by the letters <1> X y must have
taken place not later than 750 B.C. Lastly, the presence in
the alphabet of the Vau indicates a time which can hardly
be put later than 700 B.C. The conclusion is that it was
about this time, if not earlier, that the numerical alphabet
was invented.
The other view is that of Keil, who holds that it originated
in Dorian Caria, perhaps at Halicarnassus itself, about
550-425 B.C., and that it was artificially put together by
some one who had the necessary knowledge to enable him
to fill up his own alphabet, then consisting of twenty-four
letters only, by taking over F and 9 from other alphabets and
putting them in their proper places, while he completed the
numeral series by adding T at the end.1 
Keil urges, as
against Larfeld, that it is improbable that F and £1 ever
existed together in the Milesian alphabet. Larfeld's answer2
is that, although F had disappeared from ordinary language
at Miletus towards the end of the eighth century, we cannot
say exactly when it disappeared, and even if it was practically
gone at the time of the formulation of the numerical alphabet,
it would be in the interest of instruction in schools, where
Homer was read, to keep the letter as long as possible in the
official alphabet. On the other hand, KeiFs argument is open
to the objection that, if the Carian inventor could put the
F and 9 into their proper places in the series, he would hardly
have failed to put the Ssade T in its proper place also, instead
of at the end, seeing that T is found in Caria itself, namely
in a Halicarnassus (Lygdamis) inscription of about 453 B.C.,
and also in Ionic Teos about 476 B.C.3 (see pp. 31-2 above).
It was a long time before the alphabetic numerals found
general acceptance. They were not officially used until the
time of the Ptolemies, when it had become the practice to write,
in inscriptions and on coins, the year of the reign of the ruler
for the time being. The conciseness of the signs made them
particularly suitable for use on coins, where space was limited.
When coins went about the world, it was desirable that the
notation should be uniform, instead of depending on local
alphabets, and it only needed the support of some paramount

political authority to secure the final triumph of the alphabetic
system. The alphabetic numerals are found at Alexandria
on coins of Ptolemy II, Philadelphus, assigned to 266 B.C.
A coin with the inscription 'AXegdvSpov KA (twenty-fourth
year after Alexander's death) belongs, according to Keil, to
the end of the third century.1 A very old Graeco-Egyptian
papyrus (now at Leyden, No. 397), ascribed to 257 B.C.,
contains the number K8 = 29. While in Boeotia the Attic
system was in use in the middle of the third century, along
with the corresponding local system, it had to give way about
200 B.C. to the alphabetic system, as is shown by an inventory
from the temple of Amphiaraus at Oropus 2; we have here
the first official use of the alphabetic system in Greece proper.
From this time Athens stood alone in retaining the archaic
system, and had sooner or later to come into line with other
states. The last certainly attested use of the Attic notation
in Athens was about 95 B.C.; the alphabetic numerals were
introduced there some time before 50 B.C., the first example
belonging to the time of Augustus, and by A.D. 50 they were
in official use.
The two systems are found side by side in a number of
papyrus-rolls found at Herculaneum (including the treatise
of Philodemus De pietate, so that the rolls cannot be older than
40 or 50 B.C.); these state on the title page, after the name of
the author, the number of books in alphabetic numerals, and
the number of lines in the Attic notation, e.g. ETTIKOYPOY
rTEPI | cDYZEHZ | IE dpi6 . . XXXHH (where IE = 15 and
XXXHH — 3200), just as we commonly use Roman figures
to denote Books and Arabic figures for sections or lines.3

3 Reference should be made, in passing, to another, gwasi-nurnerical,
use of the letters of the ordinary alphabet, as current at the time, for
numbering particular things. As early as the fifth century we find in
a Locrian bronze-inscription the letters A to © (including f then and
there current) used to distinguish the nine paragraphs of the text. At
the same period the Athenians, instead of following the old plan of
wiiting out ordinal numbers in full, adopted the more convenient device
of denoting them by the letters of the alphabet. In the oldest known
example opos K indicated 'boundary stone No. 10'; and in the fourth
century the tickets of the ten panels of jurymen were marked with the
letters A to K. In like manner the Books in certain works of Aristotle
(the Ethics, Metaphysics, Politics, and Topics) were at some time

GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
(y) Mode of writing numbers in the ordinary alphabetic .
notation.
Where, in the alphabetical notation, the number to be
written contained more than one denomination, say, units
with tens, or with tens and hundreds, the higher numbers
were, as a rule, put before the lower. This was generally the
case in European Greece; on the other hand, in the inscrip-
tions of Asia Minor, the smaller number comes first, i. e. the
letters are arranged in alphabetical order. Thus 111 may be
represented either by PIA or by AIP; the arrangement is
sometimes mixed, as PAL The custom of writing the numbers
in descending order became more firmly established in later
times through the influence of the corresponding Roman
practice.1
The alphabetic numerals sufficed in themselves to express
all numbers from 1 to 999. For thousands (up to 9000) the
letters were used again with a distinguishing mark ; this was
generally a sloping stroke to the left, e.g. 'A or yA = 1000,
but other forms are also found, e.g. the stroke might be
combined with the letter as A = 1000 or again *A= 1000,
*E = 6000. For tens of thousands the letter M (jAvpioi) was
borrowed from the other system, e.g. 2 myriads would be
BM, MB, or M.
To distinguish letters representing numbers from 
the
letters of the surrounding text different devices are used:
sometimes the number is put between dots \ or :, or separ-
ated by spaces from the text on both sides of it. 
In Imperial
times distinguishing marks, such as a horizontal stroke above
the letter, become common, e.g. fj fiovXrj rStv X, other
variations being X-, X-, X and the like.
In the cursive writing with which we are familiar the
numbered on the same principle; so too the Alexandrine scholars
(about 280 B C.) numbered the twenty-four Books of Hoiner with the
letters A to Q. When the number of objects exceeded 24, doubled
letters served for continuing the series, as AA, BB, &c. For example,
a large quantity of building-stones have been found -, among these are
stones from the theatre at the Piraeus marked AA, BB, &c, and again
AA|BB, BB|BB, &c. when necessary. 
Sometimes the numbering by
double letters was on a different plan, the letter A denoting the full
number of the first set of letters (24); thus AP would be 24 + 17 =41.

(for convenience of printing, the horizontal stroke above the
sign will hereafter, as a rule, be omitted).
(S) Comparison of the two systems of numerical notation.
The relative merits of tfye two systems of numerical
notation used by the Greeks have been differently judged.
It will be observed that the initial-numevabh correspond
closely to the Roman numerals, except that there is no
formation of numbers by subtraction as IX, XL, XC; thus
XXXXFHHHHFAAAAPIIII = MMMMDCCCCLXXXXVI III
as compared with MMMMCMXCIX = 4999. 
The absolute
inconvenience of the Roman system will be readily appreci-
ated by any one who has tried to read Boetius (Boetius
would write the last-mentioned number asTV.DCCCCXCVIIII).
Yet Cantor1 draws a comparison between the two systems
much to the disadvantage of the alphabetic numerals.
' Instead', he says, ' of an advance we have here to do with
a decidedly retrograde step, especially so far as its suitability
for the further development of the numeral system is con-
cerned. 
If we compare the older " Herodianic" numerals
with the later signs which we have called alphabetic numerals,
we observe in the latter two drawbacks which do not attach
to the former. 
There now had to be more signs, with values
to be learnt by heart; and to reckon with them required
a much greater effort of memory. The addition
AAA + AAAA = PAA (30 + 40 = 70)
could be coordinated in one act of memory with that of
HHH + HHHH = PHH (300 + 400 = 700)
in so far as the sum of 3 and 4 units of the same kind added

up to 5 and 2 units of the same kind. On the other hand
A -h fi = o did not at all immediately indicate that r + v = \jr.
The new notation had only one advantage over the other,
namely that it took less space. Consider, for instance, 849,
which in the " Herodianic " form is HHHHAAAAPI111, but
in the alphabetic system is Q>/JL6. The former is more self-
explanatory and, for reckoning with, has most important
advantages.' Gow follows Cantor, but goes further and says
Lhat ' the alphabetical numerals were a fatal mistake and
hopelessly confined such nascent arithmetical faculty as the
Greeks may have possessed '! 1 
On the other hand, Tannery,
holding that the merits of the alphabetic numerals could only
be tested by using them, practised himself in their use until,
applying them to the whole of the calculations in Archimedes's
Measurement of a Circle, he found that the alphabetic nota-
tion had practical advantages which he had hardly suspected
before, and that the operations took little longer with Greek
than with modern numerals.2 Opposite as these two views are,
they seem to be alike based on a misconception. Surely we do
not ' reckon with ' the numeral signs at all, but with the
words for the numbers which they represent. For instance,
in Cantor's illustration, we do not conclude that the figure 3
and the figure 4 added together make the figure 7 ; what we
do is to say ' three and four are seven '. Similarly the Greek
would not say to himself ' y and 8 = £' but rpels KCLI recrcrape?
iirrd; and, notwithstanding what Cantor says, this would
indicate the corresponding addition 4 three hundred and four
hundred are seven hundred', rpiaKoa-toL KOLI rerpaKocnoL
tTTTaKoo-ioL, and similarly with multiples of ten or of 1000 or
10000. 
Again, in using the multiplication table, we say
* three times four is twelve ', or ' three multiplied by four =
twelve *; the Greek would say rpls reo-o-apey, or rpels em
reo-aapas, ScoSeKa, and this would equally indicate that ' thirty
times forty is twelve hundred or one thousand two hundred \
or that ' thirty times four hundred is twelve thousand or a
myriad and two thousand' (rpiaKovraKis Tea-a-apaKovra yiXtoi

COMPARISON OF THE TWO SYSTEMS 
39
The truth is that in mental calculation (whether the opera-
tion be addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division), we
reckon with the corresponding words, not with the symbols,
and it does not matter a jot to the calculation how we choose
to write the figures down. While therefore the alphabetical
numerals had the advantage over the ' Herodianic' of being
so concise, their only disadvantage was that there were more
signs (twenty-seven) the meaning of which had to be com-
mitted to memory: truly a very slight disadvantage. The
one real drawback to the alphabetic system was the absence
of a sign for 0 (zero) ; for the 0 for ovSejiia or ovSei/ which
we find in Ptolemy was only used in the notation of sexa-
gesimal fractions, and not as part of the numeral system. If
there had been a sign or signs to indicate the absence in
a number of a particular denomination, e.g. units or tens or
hundreds, the Greek symbols could have been made to serve
as a position-value system scarcely less effective than ours.
For, while the position-values are clear in such a number
as 7921 (,^/ca), it would only be necessary in the case of
such a number as 7021 to show a blank in the proper place
by writing, say, £- KOL. Then, following Diophantus's plan
of separating any number of myriads by a dot from the
thousands, &c, we could write £^\Ka . ^TTTS for 79216384 or
X 
• - T - S for 70000304, while we could continually add
sets of four figures to the left, separating each set from the
next following by means of a dot.
(e) Notation for large numbers.
Here too the orthodox way of writing tens of thousands
was by means of the letter M with the number of myriads
above it, e.g. M = 20000, M ecooe = 71755875 (Aristarchus
Y
of Samos); another method was to write M or M for the
myriad and to put the number of myriads after it, separated
by a dot from the remaining thousands, &c, e. g.
M pv./p)7r8= 
1507984
(Diophantus, IV. 28). Yet another way of expressing myriads
was to use the symbol representing the number of myriads
with two dots over it; thus a/jfyqP = 18592 (Heron, Geo-
metrica, 17. 33). The word pvpidSes could, of course, be
https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139600576.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press

GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
written in full, e.g. fxvpidSt? fiaor) KCCL ~^t/3 = 22780912
(ib. 17. 34). 
To express still higher numbers, powers of
myriads were used; a myriad (10000; was a first myriad
(7rpa>T7] fjivpids) to distinguish it from a second myriad (Sevripa
livptds) or 100002, and so on; the words irp&Tai fivpidSes,
Sevrepai [ivpidSes, &c, could either be written in full or
Y 
Y
expressed by M, MM, &c, respectively; thus Sevrepai /jivpidSes
o
iq 7rpooTCLL (fjtvpidSe?) 
fi^vq 
M /r0£ = 16 2958 6560 (Dio
o
phantus, V. 8), where M = fiovaSes (units) is inserted to
distinguish the ft^vrj, the number of the ' first myriads \
from the /r$£ denoting 6560 units.
(i) Apollonius's 'tetrads'.
The latter system is the same as that adopted by Apollonius
in an arithmetical work, now lost, the character of which is,
however, gathered from the elucidations in Pappus, Book II;
the only difference is that Apollonius called his tetrads (Sets
of four digits) fivptaSe? anXal, SnrXac, rpnrXcu, &c, * simple
myriads', ' double \ ' triple ', &c., meaning 10000, 100002,
100003, and so on. The abbreviations for these successive
powers in Pappus are fjf, [/, /ir, &c.; thus fivjevgfi KOLI i^/y\
Kal fi/pj = 5462 3600 6400 0000. 
Another, but a less con-
venient, method of denoting the successive powers of 10000
is indicated by Nicolas Rhabdas (fourteenth century A.B.)
who says that, while a pair of dots above the ordinary
numerals denoted the number of myriads, the ' double
myriad' was indicated by two pairs of dots one above the other,
the c triple myriad} by three pairs of dots, and so on. Thus
"^ = 9000000, /S = 2 (10000)2, jl = 40 (10000)3, and so on.
(ii) Archimedes's system (by octads).
Yet another special system invented for the purpose of
expressing very large numbers is that of Archimedes's
Psammites or Sand-reckoner. This goes by octads:
100002 = 100000000 = 108,
and all the numbers from 1 to 108 form the first order;
the last number, 108
5 of the first order is taken as the unit
of the second order, which consists of all the numbers from
https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139600576.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press

ARCHIMEDES'S SYSTEM (BY OCTADS) 
41
108, or 100000000, to 1016, or 1000000002; similarly 1016 is
taken as the unit of the third order, which consists of all
numbers from 1016 to 1024, and so on, the 100000000th order
consisting of all the numbers from (lOOOOOOOO)99999999 to
(100000000)100000000, i.e. from lO8^8"1) to 1081°8. The aggre-
gate of all the orders up to the 100000000th form the first
period; that is, if P = (100000000)108, the numbers of the
first period go from 1 to P. Next, P is the unit of the first
order of the second period] the first order of the second
period then consists of all numbers from P up to 1,00000000 P
or P . 10s; P.10 8 is the unit of the second order (of the
second period) which ends with (100000000)2 P or P.1016;
P . 1016 begins the third order of the second period, and so
on; the 100000000th order of the second period consists of
the numbers from (lOOOOOOOO)99999999 P or P . lO8-^8-1) to
(100000000)100000000 P or P . lO810*, i.e. P 2. 
Again, P 2 is the
unit of the first order of the third period, and so on. 
The
first order of the 100000000th period consists of the numbers
from P10'"1 to P10'-1. 108, the second order of the same
period of the numbers from P10^1 .10s to P10*"1.1016, and so
on, the (108)th order of the (108)th period, or the period
itself, ending with P10'"1.1081°8, i.e. P10*. The last number
is described by Archimedes as a ' myriad-jnyriad units of the
myriad-myriadth order of the myriad-myriadth period (al
fjLvpiaKi<rfivpio(rTas irepioSov /ivpiaKL(r/jivpLO(TT6^j/ dpiOficop /ivpicu
fivpidSes)'. This system was, however, a tour deforce, and has
nothing to do with the ordinary Greek numerical notation.
Fractions.
(a) The Egyptian system
We now come to the methods of expressing fractions. A
fraction may be either a submultiple (an ' aliquot part\ i. e.
a fraction with numerator unity) or an ordinary proper
fraction with a number not unity for numerator and a
greater number for denominator. The Greeks had a pre-
ference for expressing ordinary proper fractions as the sum
of two or more submultiples ; in this they followed the
Egyptians, who always expressed fractions in this way, with
the exception that they had a single sign for §, whereas we

GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
should have expected them to split it up into ^ + f, as f was
split up into ^ + J. 
The orthodox sign for a submultiple
was the letter for the corresponding number (the denomi-
nator) but with an accent instead of a horizontal stroke
above it; thus y' = §, the full expression being y fiepos =
rpirov jxipos, a third part (y' is in fact short for rpiros, so
that it is also used for the ordinal number ' third' as well
as for the fraction -|, and similarly with all other accented
numeral signs) ; \/3' = ^ , 
pi/3' = T\%, &c. 
There were
special signs for \, namely 1/ or C',1 and for §, namely w\
When a number of submultiples are written one after the
other, the sum of them is meant, and similarly when they
follow a whole number; e.g. U' & = \ \ or f (Archimedes);
K6 wf ty' \6' = 29| A- £> = 2 9i + r* + ** o r 2 9M ;
fi6 V if XV vaf = 49i TV ^ A = 49f*
(Heron, Geom. 15. 8, 13). But *)/ TO iyf means y^th times
i1^ o r xi^ (i6wi. 12. 5), &c. A less orthodox method found
in later manuscripts was to use two accents and to write,
e.g., £" instead of £', for \. 
In Diophantus we find a different
mark in place of the accent; Tannery considers the genuine
form of it to be *, so that y* = J, and so on.
()8) The ordinary Greek form, variously written.
An ordinary proper fraction (called by Euclid /lipi], £>ar£s,
in the plural, as meaning a certain number of aliquot parts,
in contradistinction to /xepoy, part, in the singular, which he
restricts to an aliquot part or submultiple) was expressed in
various ways. The first was to use the ordinary cardinal
number for the numerator followed by the accented number
representing the denominator. Thus we find in Archimedes
I oa = ^f and /zcoXrj 0 ta! — 1838T
9
T: (it should be noted,
however, that the I oa is a correction from oiat and this
oa
seems to indicate that the original reading was i, which
would accord with Diophantus's and Heron's method of
writing fractions). The method illustrated by these cases is
open to objection as likely to lead to confusion, since L oa!
1 It has been suggested that the forms Q and 3 for \ found in
inscriptions may perhaps represent half an O, the sign, at all events
in Boeotia, for 1 obol.

FRACTIONS 
43
would naturally mean 1 0 ^ and 6 ia! 9 ^ ; the context alone
shows the true meaning. Another form akin to that just
mentioned was a little less open to misconstruction; the
numerator was written in full with the accented numeral
(for the denominator) following, e.g. Svo fie' for 2/45ths
(Aristarchus of Samos). A better way was to turn the
aliquot part into an abbreviation for the ordinal number
with a termination superposed to represent the case, e.g.
«•"> = ! (Dioph. Lemma to.V. 8), v * / " = #§ (ibid. I. 23)?
pica™ ^coXSL'= 1834J/121 (ibid. IV. 39), just as y°* was
written for the ordinal rpiros (cf. TO <^OV, the §th part, Dioph.
IV. 39; aipoa ra iya ' I remove the 13ths', i.e. I multiply up
by the denominator 13, ibid. IV. 9). But the trouble was
avoided by each of two other methods.
(1) The accented letters representing the denominator were
written twice, along with the cardinal number for the
numerator. This method is mostly found in the Geometrica
and other works of Heron : cf. e iy' iyf — T
5^, ra ^ £'g = f.
The fractional signification is often emphasized by adding
the word XerrTcL ('fractions' or 'fractional parts'), e.g. in
Xenra iyf iy' ift = y§ (Geom. 12. 5), and, where the expression
contains units as well as fractions, the word ' units' (fxovdSes)
is generally added, for clearness' sake, to indicate the integral
number, e.g. /jLovdSes eft teal XenTa iy iy i$ — 12^| (Geom.
12. 5), fiovaSzs pfiS XeTrra iy iy aq6 = 144-2
T
9/ (Geom. 12. 6).
Sometimes in Heron fractions are alternatively given in this
notation and in that of submultiples, e.g. )8 yr it' r\roi ft KOU
/3 e' e' = c 2^ T\ or 2f' (Geom. 12. 48) \ £ V i' ie' oe' tjroi
/xovdSes {e'e'y

T^ or 7f + # X %\
i.e. 7-| + ^ - (ibid.); 
rj V i /ce' T\TOI fioydSe? rj e' ef y KOLI t TO e' =
Hultsch's edition of Heron single accents were used to de-
note whole numbers and the numerators of fractions, while
aliquot parts or denominators were represented by double
accents; thus the last quoted expression was written
r] S i" Ke" ffTot [lovdSes r{ e" e" y' Kal e" TO e".)
But (2) the most convenient notation of all is that which
is regularly employed by Diophantus, and occasionally in the
Metrica of Heron. 
In this system the numerator of any
fraction is written in the line, with the denominator above it,
https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139600576.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press

44 
GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
without accents or other marks (except where the numerator
or denominator itself contains an accented fraction) ; the
method is therefore simply the reverse of ours, but equally
convenient. In Tannery's edition of Diophantus a line is
put between the numerator below and the denominator above :
i^L 
121
thus pKa = - • But it is better to omit the horizontal line
PKV 
1 0 0
(cf. p =

(IV. 28); jervn = ^ 
(V. 9); mOV = ^ . 
The deno-
minator is rarely found above the numerator, but to the
right (like an exponent); e.g. T?s = — (I. 39). Even in the
case of a submultiple, where, as we have said, the orthodox
method was to omit the numerator and simply write the
denominator with an accent, Diophantus often follows the
method applicable to other fractions, e.g. he writes 
a for
•51^ (IV- 28). Numbers partly integral and partly fractional,
where the fraction is a submultiple or expressed as the sum
of submultiples, are written much as we write them, the
fractions simply following the integer, e.g. a y * = l | ;
j8 V <r* = 2\\ (Lemma to V. 8); TO Ur i?* = 370£ ^ (III. 11).
Complicated fractions in which the numerator and denomi-
nator are algebraical expressions or large numbers are often
expressed by writing the numerator first and separating it
by fiopiov or kv (xoptcp from the denominator; i.e. the fraction
is expressed as the numerator divided by the denominator:
thus Mpv ./"V5 fiopiov K? . fipfxS — 1507984/262144 (IV. 28).
(y) Sexagesimal fractions.
Great interest attaches to the system of sexagesimal
fractions (Babylonian in its origin, as we have seen) which
was used by the Greeks in astronomical calculations, and
https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139600576.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press

SEXAGESIMAL FRACTIONS 
45
appears fully developed in the Syntaxis of Ptolemy. The
circumference of a circle, and with it the four right angles
subtended by it at the centre, were divided into 360 parts
(TfjLrjfiaTa or /xoipat), as we should say degrees, each \xoipa
into 60 parts called (irp&Ta) igrjKoo-Ta, (first) sixtieths or
minutes (X^irrd), each of these again into 60 Sevrepa k^Koard,
seconds, and so on. 
In like manner, the diameter of the
circle was divided into 120 r/jL^fiaTa, segments, and each of
these segments was divided into sixtieths, each sixtieth
again into sixty parts, and so on. 
Thus a convenient
fractional system was available for arithmetical calculations
in general; for the unit could be chosen at will, and any
mixed number could be expressed as so many of those units
plus so many of the fractions which we should represent
by ^-Q, so many of those which we should write (-£o)2, (wo)3,
and so on to any extent. The units, T/irj/iaTa or /xoipai (the
latter often denoted by the abbreviation fx.°), were written
first, with the ordinary numeral representing the number
of them; then came a simple numeral with one accent repre-
senting that number of first sixtieths, or minutes, then a
numeral with two accents representing that number of
second sixtieths, or seconds, and so on. 
Thus /i° /3 = 2°,
jioipS>v ji£ fifi' n" = 47° 42' 40". 
Similarly, TfirjfidTcov ££
8' ve" = 67P 4' 55", where p denotes the segment (of the
diameter). 
Where there was no unit, or no number of
sixtieths, second sixtieths, &c, the symbol O, signifying
fioipa, ovSey k^Kocrrov, and the like, was used; thus
cov O a (3" O'" = 0ol7 2//0///. The system is parallel to
our system of decimal fractions, with the difference that the
submultiple is WV instead of x ^ ; nor is it much less easy to
work with, while it furnishes a very speedy way of approxi-
mating to the values of quantities not expressible in whole
numbers. For example, in his Table of Chords, Ptolemy says
that the chord subtending an angle of 120° at the centre is
(Tfi-qjidrcov) py vt Ky" or 103^ 55' 23"; this is equivalent
(since the radius of the circle is 60 T/irj/jiaTa) to saying that
A/3 = I H 
1" •—2 H 
d, and this works out to 1-7320509...,
which is correct to the seventh decimal place, and exceeds
the true value by 0-00000003 only.

GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
Practical calculation.
(a) The abacus.
In practical calculation it was open to the Greeks to secure
the advantages of a position-value system by using the
abacus. The essence of the abacus was the arrangement of
it in columns which might be vertical or horizontal, but were
generally vertical, and pretty certainly so in Greece and
Egypt; the columns were marked off by lines or in some
other way and allocated to the successive denominations of
the numerical system in use, i.e., in the case of the decimal
system, the units, tens, hundreds, thousands, myriads, and so
on. The number of units of each denomination was shown in
each column by means of pebbles, pegs, or the like. When,
in the process of addition or multiplication, the number of
pebbles collected in one column becomes sufficient to make
one or more units of the next higher denomination, the num-
ber of pebbles representing the complete number of the higher
units is withdrawn from the column in question and the
proper number of the higher units added to the next higher
column. Similarly, in subtraction, when a number of units of
one denomination 'has to be subtracted and there are not
enough pebbles in the particular column to subtract from, one
pebble from the next higher column is withdrawn and actually
or mentally resolved into the number of the lower units
equivalent in value; the latter number of additional pebbles
increases the number already in the column to a number from
which the number to be subtracted can actually be withdrawn.
The details of the columns of the Greek abacus have unfor-
tunately to be inferred from the corresponding details of the
Roman abacus, for the only abaci which have been preserved
and can with certainty be identified as such are Roman.
There were two kinds; in one of these the marks were
buttons or knobs which could be moved up and down in each
column, but could not be taken out of it, while in the other
kind they were pebbles which could also be moved from one
column to another. Each column was in two parts, a shorter
portion at the top containing one button only, which itself
represented half the number of units necessary to make up
one of the next higher units, and a longer portion below

PRACTICAL CALCULATION 
47
containing one less than half the same number. This arrange-
ment of the columns in two parts enabled the total number of
buttons to be economized. The columns represented, so far as
integral numbers were concerned, units, tens, hundreds, thou-
sands, &c, and in these cases the one button in the top
portion of each column represented five units, and there were
four buttons in the lower portion representing four units.
But after the columns representing integers came columns
representing fractions; the first contained buttons represent-
ing unciae, of which there were 12 to the unit, i.e. fractions
of -^th, and in this case the one button in the top portion
represented 6 unciae or -^ths, while there were 5 buttons in
the lower portion (instead of 4), the buttons in the column
thus representing in all 11 unciae or 12ths. After this column
there were (in one specimen) three other shorter ones along-
side the lower portions only of the columns for integers, the
first representing fractions of ^ t h (one button), the second
fractions of ^gth (one button), and the third fractions of ^ n d
(two buttons, which of course together made up ^§th).
The mediaeval writer of the so-called geometry of Boetius
describes another method of indicating in the various columns
the number of units of each denomination.1 According to him
'abacus' was a later name for what was previously called
mensa Pythagorea, in honour of the Master who had taught
its use. The method was to put in the columns, not the neces-
sary number of pebbles or buttons, but the corresponding
numeral, which might be written in sand spread over the
surface (in the same way as Greek geometers are said to have
drawn geometrical figures in sand strewn on boards similarly
called a flag or afiaKiov). The figures put in the columns were
called apices. The first variety of numerals mentioned by the
writer are rough forms of the Indian figures (a fact which
proves the late date of the composition); but other forms were
(1) the first letters of the alphabet (which presumably mean
the Greek alphabetic numerals) or (2) the ordinary Roman
figures.
We should expect the arrangement of the Greek abacus to
correspond to the Roman, but the actual evidence regarding its

we may well doubt whether any great use was made of it at
all. But the use of pebbles to reckon with is attested by
several writers. In Aristophanes (Wasps, 656-64) Bdelycleon
tells his father to do an easy sum ' not with pebbles but with
fingers', as much as to say, ' There is no need to use pebbles
for this sum; you can do it on your fingers.' ' The income
of the state7, he says, 'is 2000 talents; the yearly payment
to the 6000 dicasts is only 150 talents/ 'Why', answers the
old man, c we don't get a tenth of the revenue/ The calcula-
tion in this case amounted to multiplying 150 by 10 to show
that the product is less than 2000. But more to the purpose
are the following allusions. Herodotus says that, in reckoning
with pebbles, as in writing, the Greeks move their hand from
left to right, the Egyptians from right to left *; this indicates
that the columns were vertical, facing the reckoner. Diogenes
Laertius attributes to Solon a statement that those who had
influence with tyrants were like the pebbles on a reckoning-
board, because they sometimes stood for more and sometimes
for less.2 A character in a fourth-century comedy asks for an
abacus and pebbles to do his accounts.3 But most definite of
all is a remark of Polybius that ' These men are really like
the pebbles on reckoning-boards. For the latter, according
to the pleasure of the reckoner, have the value, now of a
XCCXKOVS (Jth of an obol or ^ t h of a drachma), and the next
moment of a talent/ 4 The passages of Diogenes Laertius and
Polybius both indicate that the pebbles were not fixed in the
columns, but could be transferred from one to another, and
the latter passage has some significance in relation to the
Salaminian table presently to be mentioned, because the talent
and the XCLXKOVS are actually the extreme denominations on
one side of the table.
Two relics other than the Salaminian table may throw
some light on the subject. First, the so-called Darius-vase
found at Canosa (Canusium), south-west of Barletta, represents
a collector of tribute of distressful countenance with a table in
front of him having pebbles, or (as some maintain) coins, upon
it and, on the right-hand edge, beginning on the side farthest
away and written in the direction towards him, the letters

>PO<T, while in his left hand he holds a sort of book in
which, presumably, he has to enter the receipts. Now M, Y
(= X), H, and > are of course the initial letters of the words
for 10000, 1000, 100, and 10 respectively. Here therefore we
have a purely decimal system, without the halfway numbers
represented by P (= irhre, 5) in combination with the other
initial letters which we find in the ' Attic' system. The sign
P after V seems to be wrongly written for P, the older sign
for a drachma, O stands for the obol, < for the J-obol, andT
(Teraprrj/jLopLoj/) for the ^-obol.1 Except that the fractions of
the unit (here the drachma) are * different from the fractions
of the Roman unit, this scheme corresponds to the Roman,
and so far might represent the abacus. Indeed, the decimal
arrangement corresponds better to the abacus than does the
Salaminian table with its intermediate ' Herodianic' signs for
500, 50, and 5 drachmas. Prof. David Eugene Smith is, how-
ever, clear that any one can see from a critical examination of
the piece that what is represented is an ordinary money-
changer or tax-receiver with coins on a table such as one
might see anywhere in the East to-day, and that the table has
no resemblance to an abacus.2 On the other hand, it is to be
observed that the open book held by the tax-receiver in his
left hand has TAAN on one page and TA1H on the other,
which would seem to indicate that he was entering totals in
talents and must therefore presumably have been adding coins
or pebbles on the table before him.
There is a second existing monument of the same sort,
namely a so-called a-rJKcojia (or arrangement of measures)
discovered about forty years ago3; it is a stone tablet with
fluid measures and has, on the right-hand side, the numerals
XF'HF'APKnc. 
The signs are the 'Herodianic', and they
include those for 500, 50, and 5 drachmas; h is the sign for
a drachma, T evidently stands for some number of obols
making a fraction of the drachma, i.e. the rpi&fioXov or 3
obojs, I for an obol, and C for a J-obol.
The famous Salaminian table was discovered by Rangab^,

wards (1846).1 The table, now broken into two unequal parts,
is in the Epigraphical Museum at Athens. The facts with
regard to it are stated, and a photograph of it is satisfactorily
produced, by Wilhelm Kubitschek.2 A representation of it is
also given by Nagl 3 based on Rangabe"s description, and the
sketch of it here appended follows Nagl's drawing. The size
and material of the table (according to Rangabe"s measure-
ments it is 1*5 metres long and 0*75 metre broad) show that
it was no ordinary abacus; it may
have been a fixture intended for
quasi-public use, such as a banker's
or money-changer's table, or again
it may have been a scoring-table
for some kind of game like tric-
trac or backgammon. Opinion has
from the first been divided between
the two views; it has even been
suggested that the table was in-
tended for both purposes. But there
can be no doubt that it was used
for some kind of calculation and,
if it was not actually an abacus, it
may at least serve to give an idea
of what the abacus was like. The
difficulties connected with its in-
terpretation, are easily seen. The
series of letters on the three sides are the same except
that two of them go no higher than X (1000. drachmae),
but the third has P (5000 drachmae), and T (the talent or
6000 drachmae) in addition; h is the sign for a drachma,
I for an obol (Jth of the drachma), C for -|-obol, T for ^-obol
(reTaprrj/jLopioy, Boeckh's suggestion), not ^-obol (Tpirrjfjiopiov,
Vincent), and X for |-obol (X^KOVS). 
It seems to be
agreed that the four spaces provided between the five shorter
lines were intended for the fractions of the drachma; the first
space would require 5 pebbles (one less than the 6 obols
making up a drachma), the others one each. The longer

lines would provide the spaces for the drachmae and higher
denominations. On the assumption that the cross line indi-
cates the Roman method of having one pebble above it to
represent 5, and four below it representing units, it is clear
that,including denominations up to the talent (6000 drachmae),
only five columns are necessary, namely one for the talent or
6000 drachmae, and four for 1000, 100, 10 drachmae, and .1
drachma respectively. 
But there are actually ten spaces pro-
vided by the eleven lines. On the theory of the game-board,
five of the ten on one side (right or left) are supposed to
belong to each of two players placed facing each other on the
two longer sides of the table (but, if in playing they had to
use the shorter columns for the fractions, it is not clear how
they would make them suffice); the cross on the middle of the
middle line might in that case serve to mark the separation
between the lines belonging to the two players, or perhaps all
the crosses may have the one object of helping the eye to dis-
tinguish all the columns from one another. On the assump-
tion that the table is an abacus, a possible explanation of the
eleven lines is to suppose that they really supply jive columns
only, the odd lines marking the divisions between the columns,
and the even lines, one in the middle of each column,
marking where the pebbles should be placed in rows; in this
case, if the crosses are intended to mark divisions between the
four pebbles representing units and the one pebble represent-
ing 5 in each column, the crosses are only required in the last
three columns (for 100, 10, and 1), because, the highest de-
nomination being 6000 drachmae, there was no need for a
division of the 1000-column, which only required five unit-
pebbles altogether. 
Nagl, a thorough-going supporter of the
abacus-theory to the exclusion of the other, goes further and
shows how the Salaminian table could have been used for-the
special purpose of carrying out a long multiplication ; but this
development seems far-fetched, and there is no evidence of
such a use.
The Greeks in fact had little need of the abacus for calcu-
lations. With their alphabetic numerals they could work out
their additions, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions
without the help of any marked columns, in a form little less
convenient than ours: examples of long multiplications, which

include addition as the last step in each case, are found in
Eutocius's commentary on Archimedes's Measurement of
a Circle. We will take the four arithmetical operations
separately.
()8) Addition and Subtraction.
There is no doubt that, in writing down numbers for the
purpose of these operations, the Greeks would keep the several
powers of 10 separate in a manner practically corresponding
to our system of numerals, the hundreds, thousands, &c, being
written in separate vertical rows. The following would be
a typical example of a sum in addition:

and the mental part of the work would be the same for the
Greek as for us.
Similarly a subtraction would be represented as follows:

Multiplication.
(i) The Egyptian method.
For carrying out multiplications two things were required.
The first was a multiplication table. This the Greeks are
certain to have had from very early times. The Egyptians,
indeed, seem never to have had such a table. We know from
the Papyrus Rhind that in order to multiply by any number
the Egyptians began by successive doubling, thus obtaining
twice, four times, eight times, sixteen times the multiplicand,
and so on; they then added such sums of this series of multi-
ples (including once the multiplicand) as were required. Thus,
https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139600576.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press

MULTIPLICATION 
53
to multiply by 13, they did not take 10 times and 3 times
the multiplicand respectively and add them, but they found
13 times the multiplicand by adding once and 4 times and 8
times it, which elements they had obtained by the doubling
process; similarly they would find 25 times any number by
adding once and 8 times and 16 times the number.1 
Division
was performed by the Egyptians in an even more rudimen-
tary fashion, namely by a tentative back-multiplication begin-
ning with the same doubling process. 
But, as we have seen
(p. 14), the scholiast to the Charmides says that the branches
of Xoyio-TiKrj include the 'so-called Greek and 
Egyptian
methods in multiplications and divisions'.
(ii) The Greek method.
The Egyptian method being what we have just described, it
seems clear that the Greek method, which was different,
depended on the direct use of a multiplication table. 
A frag-
ment of such a multiplication table is preserved on a two-
leaved wax tablet in the British Museum (Add. MS. 34186).
1 I have been told that there is a method in use to-day (some say in
Russia, but I have not been able to verify this), which is certainly attractive
and looks original, but which will immediately be seen to amount simply
to an elegant practical method of carrying out the Egyptian procedure.
Write out side by side in successive lines, so as to form two columns,
(1) the multiplier and multiplicand, (2) half the multiplier (or the
nearest integer below it if the multiplier is odd) and twice the multi-
plicand, (3) half (or the nearest integer below the half) of the number
in the first column of the preceding row and twice the number in the
second column of the preceding row, and so on, until we have 1 in
the first column. Then strike out all numbers in the second column
which are opposite even numbers in the first column, and add all fche
numbers left in the second column. 
The sum will be the required
product. Suppose e.g. that 157 is to be multiplied by 83. The rowa
and columns then are :
83 
157
41 
314
20 
-628-
io 
me-
5 
2512
2 
Wfe
1 
10048
13031 = 83x157
The explanation is, of course, that, where we take half the preceding
number in the first column less one, we omit once the figure in the right-
hand column, so that it must be left in that column to be added in at
the end; and where we take the exact half of an even number, we
omit nothing in the right-hand column, but the new line is the exact
equivalent of the preceding one, which can therefore be struck out.

GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
It is believed to date from the second century A.D., and it
probably came from Alexandria or the vicinity. 
But the
form of the characters and the mingling of capitals and small
letters both allow of an earlier date; e.g. there is in the
Museum a Greek papyrus assigned to the third century B.C.
in which the numerals are very similar to those on the tablet.1
The second requirement is .connected with the fact that the
Greeks began their multiplications by taking the product of
the highest constituents first, i.e. they proceeded as we should
if we were to begin our long multiplications from the left
instead of the right. 
The only difficulty would be to settle
the denomination of the products of two high powers of ten.
With such numbers as the Greeks usually had to multiply
there would be no trouble; but if, say, the factors were un-
usually large numbers, e.g. millions multiplied by millions or
billions, care would be required, and even some rule for
settling the denomination, or determining the particular
power or powers of 10 which the product would contain.
This exceptional necessity was dealt with in the two special
treatises, by Archimedes and Apollonius respectively, already
mentioned. The former, the Sand-reckoner, proves that, if
there be a series of numbers, 1, 10, 102, 103... 10m... 10n...,
then, if 10m, 10w be any two terms of the series, their product
10m. 10n will be a term in the same series and will be as many
terms distant from 1071 as the term 10m is distant from 1;
also it will be distant from 1 by a number of terms less by
one than the sum of the numbers of terms by which 10m and
1071 respectively are distant from 1. This is easily seen to be
equivalent to the fact that, 10m being the (m+ l)th term
beginning with 1, and 10w the (n + l)th term beginning
with 1, the product of the two terms is the (m + n + l)th
term beginning with 1, and is iom+n.
(iii) Apollonius's continued multiplications.
The system of Apollonius deserves a short description.2 Its
object is to give a handy method of finding the continued
product of any number of factors, each of which is represented
by a single letter in the Greek numeral notation. It does not

therefore show how to multiply two large numbers each of
which contains a number of digits (in our notation), that is,
a certain number of units, a certain number of tens, a certain
number of hundreds, &c.; it is confined to the multiplication
of any number of factors each of which is one or other of the
following : (a) a number of units as 1, 2, 3, ... 9, (b) a number
of even tens as 10, 20, 30,... 90, (c) a number of even hundreds
as 100, 200, 300, ... 900. It does not deal with factors above
hundreds, e.g. 1000 or 4000; this is because the Greek
numeral alphabet only went up to 900, the notation begin-
ning again after that with a, ,/?,... for 1000, 2000, &c. The
essence of the method is the separate multiplication (1) of the
bases, nvd/jiij/es, of the several factors, (2) of the powers of ten
contained in the factors, that is, what we represent by the
ciphers in each factor. 
Given*a multiple of ten, say 30, 3 is
the irvOjirjv or base, being the same number of units as the
number contains tens ; similarly in a multiple of 100, say 800,
8 is the base. In multiplying three numbers such as 2, 30,
800, therefore, Apollonius first multiplies the bases, 2, 3, and 8,
then finds separately the product of the ten and the hundred,
and lastly multiplies the two products. The final product has
to be expressed as a certain number of units less than a
myriad, then a certain number of myriads, a certain number
of 'double myriads' (myriads squared), 'triple myriads'
(myriads cubed), &c, in other words in the form
where If is a myriad or 104 and Ao, Ax... respectively repre-
sent some number not exceeding 9999.
No special directions are given for carrying out the multi-
plication of the bases (digits), or for the multiplication of
their product into the product of the tens, hundreds, &c,
when separately found (directions for the latter multiplica-
tion may have been contained in propositions missing from
the mutilated fragment in Pappus). But the method of deal-
ing with the tens and hundreds (the ciphers in our notation)
is made the subject of a considerable number of separate
propositions. Thus in two propositions the factors are all of
one sort (tens or hundreds), in another we have factors of two
sorts (a number of factors containing units only multiplied
https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139600576.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press

56 
GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
by a number of multiples of ten, each less than 100, or by
multiples of 100, each less than 1000), and so on. In the final
proposition (25), with which the introductory lemmas close,
the factors are of all three kinds, some containing units only,
others being multiples of 10 (less than 100) and a third set
being multiples of 100 (less than 1000 in each case). 
As
Pappus frequently says, the proof is easy ' in numbers';
Apollonius himself seems to have proved the propositions by
means of lines or a diagram in some form. The method is the
equivalent of taking the indices of all the separate powers of
ten included in the factors (in which process ten = 10* counts
as 1, and 100 = 102 as 2), adding the indices together, and then
dividing the sum by 4 to obtain the power of the myriad
(10000) which the product contains. If the whole number in
the quotient is n, the product contains (10000)w or the
w-myriad in Apollonius's notation. There will in most cases
be a remainder left after division by 4, namely 3, 2, or 1 : the
remainder then represents (in our notation) 3, 2, or 1 more
ciphers, that is, the product is 1000, 100, or 10 times the
w-myriad, or the 10000w, as the case may be.
We cannot do better than illustrate by the main problem
which Apollonius sets himself, namely that of multiplying
together all. the numbers represented by the separate letters
in the hexameter:
yApT€jiL8o$ KXELTE Kpdros t^oyov 
kvvka 
Kovpcu.
The number of letters, and therefore of factors, is 38, of which
10 are multiples of 100 less than 1000, namely py r, a-, r} p, r,
<r, X, v, p (=100, 300, 200, 300, 100, 300, 200, 600, 400, 100),
1 7 are multiples of 10 less than 100, namely /x, L, O, K, A, i, K, O, £,
o, o, v, v, v, K, o, i ( = 40, 10, 70, 20, 30, 10, 20, 70, 60, 70, 70, 50,
50, 50, 20, 70, 10), and 11 are numbers of units not exceeding
9, namely a, e, 8, e, e, a, e, e, e, a, a( = l, 5, 4, 5, 5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 1, 1).
The sum of the indices of powers of ten contained in the
factors is therefore 10.2 + 17.1=37. This, when divided by
4, gives 9 with 1 as remainder. Hence the product of all the
tens and hundreds, excluding the bases in each, is 10. 100009.
We have now, as the second part of the operation, to mul-
tiply the numbers containing units only by the bases of all the
other factors, i.e. (beginning with the bases, first of the hun-
dreds, then of the tens) to multiply together the numbers:

and

The product is at once given in the text as 19 ' quadruple
myriads', 6036 ' triple myriads', and 8480 ' double myriads', or
19 . 100004 + 6036 . 100003 + 8480 .100002.
(The detailed multiplication line by line, which is of course
perfectly easy, is bracketed by Hultsch as interpolated.)
Lastly, says Pappus, this product multiplied by the other
(the product of the tens and hundreds without the bases),
namely 10.100009, as above, gives
196 . 1000013 + 368 . 1000012 + 4800 . 10000u.
(iv) Examples of ordinary multiplications.
I shall now illustrate, by examples taken from Eutocius, the
Greek method of performing long multiplications. It will be
seen that, as in the case of addition and subtraction, the
working is essentially the same as ours. The multiplicand is
written first, and below it is placed the multiplier preceded by
km (= ' by' or c into'). Then the term containing the highest
power of 10 in the multiplier is taken and multiplied into all
the terms in the multiplicand, one after the other, first into that
containing the highest power of 10, then into that containing
the next highest power of 10, and so on in descending order ;
after which the term containing the next highest power of 10
in the multiplier is multiplied into all the terms of the multi-
plicand in the same order; and so on. The same procedure
is followed where either or both of the numbers to be multi-
plied contain fractions. 
Two examples from Eutocius will
make the whole operation clear.

The operation of division depends on those of multiplication
and subtraction, and was performed by the Greeks, mutatis

for example, that the process in the first of the above multi-
prr/3
plications had to be reversed and M^aa (1825201) had to be
divided by t<nva (1351). The terms involving the successive
powers of 10 would be mentally kept separate, as in addition
and subtraction, and the first question would be, how many
times does one thousand go into one million, allowing for the
fact that the one thousand has 351 behind it, while the one
million has 825 thousands behind it. The answer is one
thousand or /a, and this multiplied by the divisor ^arva gives

remainder ( = 474201) has now to be divided by ^arva (1351),
and it would be seen that the latter would go into the former
r (300) times, but not v (400) times. Multiplying ^arva by r,
we obtain M,eT (405300), which, when subtracted from My8aa
(474201), leaves M^^a (68901). This has again to be divided
by yari/a and goes v (50) times; multiplying tarva by v, we
have M/0i/ (67550), which, subtracted from Mrj^a (68901),
leaves jnrva (1351). The last quotient is therefore a (1), and
the whole quotient is 4arva (1351).
An actual case of long division where both dividend and
divisor contain sexagesimal fractions is described by Theon.
The problem is to divide 1515 20' 15" by 25 12' 10", and
Theon's account of the process amounts to the following:

Theon's and that of dividing M^ara by J&TVCL as above is that
Theon makes three subtractions for one term of the quotient,
whereas the remainder was arrived at in the other case after
one subtraction. The result is that, though Theon's method
is quite clear, it is longer, and moreover makes it less easy to
foresee what will be the proper figure to try in the quotient,
so that more time would probably be lost in making un-
successful trials.
(e) Extraction of the square root.
We are now in a position to see how the problem of extract-
ing the square root of a number would be attacked. First, as
in the case of division, the given whole number would be
separated into terms containing respectively such and such
a number of units and of the separate powers of 10. Thus
there would be so many units, so many tens, so many hun-
dreds, &c, and it would have to be borne in mind that the
squares of numbers from 1 to 9 lie between 1 and 99, the
squares of numbers from 10 to 90 between 100 and 9900, and
so on. Then the first term of the square root would be some
number of tens or hundreds or thousands, and so on, and
would have to be found in much the same way as the first
term of a quotient in a long division, by trial if necessary.
If A is the number the square root of which is required, while
a represents the first term or denomination of the square root,
and x the next term or denomination to be found, it would be
necessary to use the identity (a + x)2 = a2 + 2ax + x2 and to
find x so that 2ax + x2 might be somewhat less than the
remainder A —a2, i.e. we have to divide A — a2 by 2a, allowing
for the fact that not only must 2 ax (where x is the quotient)
but also (2a-\-x)x be less than A—a2. 
Thus,'by trial, the
highest possible value of x satisfying the condition would be
easily found. 
If that value were 6, the further quantity
2ab + b2 would have to be subtracted from the first remainder
A —• a2, and from the second remainder thus left a third term
or denomination of the square root would have to be found in
like manner; and so on. That this was the actual procedure
followed is clear from a simple case given by Theon of Alex-
andria in his commentary on the Syntaxis. 
Here the square
root of 144 is in question, and it is obtained by means of

EXTRACTION OF THE SQUARE ROOT

Eucl. II. 4. The highest possible denomination (i.e. power
of 16) in the square root is 10 ; 102 subtracted from 144 leaves
44, and this must contain, not only twice the product of 10
and the next term of the square root, but also the square of
the next term itself. Now twice 1.10 itself produces 20, and
the division of 44 by 20 suggests 2 as the next term of the
square root; this turns out to be the exact figure required, since
2.20 + 22 = 44.
The same procedure is illustrated by Theon's explanation
of Ptolemy's method of extracting square roots according to
the sexagesimal system of fractions. The problem is to find
approximately the square root of 4500 /xoipai or degrees, and

a geometrical figure is used which proves beyond doubt the
essentially Euclidean basis of the whole method. The follow-
ing arithmetical representation of the purport of the passage,
when looked at in the light of the figure, will make the
matter clear. 
Ptolemy has first found the integral part of
\/(4500) to be 67. Now 672 = 4489, so that the remainder is
11. Suppose now that the rest of the square root is expressed
by means of sexagesimal fractions, and that we may therefore
write
7(4500)= 67 + ± + fa>
where x, y are yet to be found. 
Thus x must be such that
2. 67^/60 is somewhat less than 11, or x must be somewhat

Theon's plan does not work conveniently, so far as the

EXTRACTION OF THE SQUARE ROOT

If we first found the unit 1 and then tried to find the next
term by trial, it would probably involve a troublesome amount
of trials. 
An alternative method in such a case was to
multiply the number by 602, thus reducing it to second-
sixtieths, and then, taking the square root, to ascertain the
number of first-sixtieths in it. Now 3.602= 10800, and, as
1032= 10609, the first element in the square root of 3 is
found in this way to be 
(= 1 + —-). That this was the
60 ^ 
60
method in such cases is indicated by the fact that, in the Table
of Chords, each chord is expressed as a certain number of
first-sixtieths, followed by the second-sixtieths, &c, Vs being
expressed as -^r + ^ H 
3« The same thing is indicated by
the scholiast to Eucl., Book X, who begins the operation of
finding the square root of 31 10' 36" by reducing this to
second-sixtieths; the number of second-sixtieths is 112236,
which gives, as the number of first-sixtieths in the square
335
root, 335, while —— = 5 35'. The second-sixtieths in the
60
square root can then be found in the same way as in Theon's
example. Or, as the scholiast says, we can obtain the square
root as far as the second-sixtieths by reducing the original
number to fourth-sixtieths, and so on. This would no doubt
be the way in which the approximate value 2 49' 42" 20'" 10""
given by the scholiast for V8 was obtained, and similarly
with other approximations of his, such as V2 =1 24' 51" and
7(27) = 5 11' 46" 50'" (the 50'" should be 10'").
(£) Extraction 
of the cube root
Our method of extracting the cube root of a number depends
upon the formula {a + #)3 = a3 + 3a2x + 3 ax2 + x\ just as the
extraction of the square root depends on the formula
(a + x)2 = a2 + 2ax + x2. As we have seen, the Greek method
of extracting the square root was to use the latter (Euclidean)
formula just as we do; but in no extant Greek writer do we
find any description of the operation of extracting the cube
root. It is possible that the Greeks had not much occasion
for extracting cube roots, or that a table of cubes would
suffice for most of their purposes. But that they had some

method is clear from a passage of Heron, where he gives 4-—
as an approximation to ^/(100), and shows how he obtains it.1
Heron merely gives the working dogmatically, in concrete
numbers, without explaining its theoretical basis, and we
cannot be quite certain as to the precise formula underlying
the operation. The best suggestion which has been made on
the subject will be given in its proper place, the chapter
on Heron.
