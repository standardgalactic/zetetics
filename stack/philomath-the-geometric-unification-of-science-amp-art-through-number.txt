NUMBERS: KEYS TO THE DIVINE
ENCRYPTION
 
Since the dawn of time, humans have counted. They counted their
fingers and household, animals and cattle, days and nights, months and
years, and so on. Whether consciously or subconsciously, the aspect of
numbers has always been wired into their brains. Initially, numbers were
expressed in limited terms, such as one, two, and many. Since then,
however, they evolved greatly, stretching out toward infinity, and at the
same time were given all sorts of shapes and forms to be easily represented
and manipulated. More importantly, though, they were given meanings and
symbolism.
The relationships humans found between the world around them
and their invented tool of numbers were plenty and fundamental. From their
own body parts to the plants and their seeds and yields to the cycles of the
Moon and the periods of the Sun and planets, all awakened inside them a
sense of a connection and meaning behind the universe. Moreover, they
realized that geometry and numbers are not separate entities; they are
strongly connected and interlinked. Can we think of a pentagonal flower
without invoking number 5 in the back of our heads? The Fibonacci
sequence is purely numeric in its essence; however, once its numbers are
mapped into dimensions of squares, a beautiful spiral found abundantly in
nature can be traced within. Fundamental constants like π and the golden
ratio Φ  are infinite numbers that govern geometrical forms and their
expansions. In fact, whenever there is a shape or form that resonates with us
humans, its dimensions and their proportions would almost always be based
on magical numbers or fundamental constants. 
Believing that numbers and geometry emanate from the same
source, there must be a reason why certain number/shape combinations
were chosen for this creature while others were chosen for that. Thus,
humans saw in nature a puzzle, a divine encryption whose deciphering keys
are scattered all around, hidden within the complex layers of the world they
perceive through their senses.
As we receive geometrical patterns through our eyes, one way they
are perceived within our brains is through numbers, e.g., 3 for a triangle, 4
for a square, etc. Those shapes that cannot be described as such will mostly

be considered random or non-uniform. Even for a 3-dimensional sphere, if
the two perpendicular diameters of its 2-dimensional mental-projection are
not equal -do not have a ratio of unity- then it is not a circle and,
consequently, not a true sphere. This could very well be how our brains
work;

they transform everything into numbers and ratios subconsciously and
based on these values, they decide on proportions, distances, uniformity,
etc. And if these ratios
turned out to be based on magical numbers, the experience would transcend
our brains and delves deep into our souls.
 
Figure 1: A perfect spiral made from adjacent squares having dimensions based on the Fibonacci
sequence.
 
Hence, numbers are one conduit by which the sight, mind, and soul
are interconnected. And through this sense, man found the second layer of
the divine encryption, geometry, where the first layer is but numbers
themselves.
Hearing is the next most important sense humans possess (some
may argue it is the first most important). There are several properties that
quantify the phenomenon of sound. There is the frequency, pitch,
amplitude, etc., all of which are described through numbers. But in order
for a combination of sound tones to feel pleasant
and harmonious to our ears, to become music, the numbers that describe
them must have specific values and ratios between each other. This is what
Pythagoras is believed to had discovered more than two millennia ago, that
particular ratios of notes produce enjoyable experiences, while others do
not. Therefore, even though the hearing experience, in general, is not based
entirely on numbers, what is pleasant to the human ear and soul depends
heavily on them. In this sense, geometry and sound are similar, as for them
to be received well by our brains and resonate with our souls, they must
correspond to specific numbers and ratios. (And as we to discover later,
geometry is very much interconnected with sound, especially music.) Thus,
man discovered the third layer of the divine encryption: sound and music.

Those numbers humans repeatedly observed in nature, whether in
form or sound, held a special place within their conscious and subconscious
minds. They were

deemed Magical, emanating from the divine intellect to manifest as
wonderful creations in our earthly domain. From this belief, scientists,
philosophers, and artists embarked on a mission to incorporate these
magical numbers within their works,
whether a book, a painting, or even a musical piece. For example, many
authors arranged their books’ chapters based on specific numeric
sequences, like that of Fibonacci. Sometimes, they would put hints or
references to these numbers inside their texts by repeating
certain words or capitalizing specific letters, etc. Some musicians are
believed to have composed their pieces based on specific numeric ratios and
mathematical constants, e.g., the golden ratio.
But none exploited the power of numbers and their meaning better
than painters and architects. It is in these visual domains that numbers
found fertile grounds where they can be deeply seeded, whether in a
painting or a building, to endow it with energy, make it harmonious to the
gazer, and of course, hide messages and clues that may lay dormant for
hundreds or even thousands of years before the sharp eyes of the seeker
awaken them.
Ancient buildings and temples have always been living testimonies
for the number-obsessed minds behind their creation. Structures like the
Great Pyramid of Giza or the Parthenon of Greece are filled with constants
of nature, from π to e to Φ , to mention a few. To be able to embed these
numbers in the design and dimensions of their buildings, the architect and
masons were required to have excellent mathematical knowledge and
engineering skills. Therefore, magical numbers were not only the result of
keen observation and contemplation; they also motivated the research for
more advanced mathematics, engineering, and science.
The final layer of the divine encryption came from natural sciences,
where many fundamental numbers, labeled constants, were found to control
life and the whole universe, such as the fine structure constant α , which
control the interaction of light and matter, the Euler constant e, which
control radioactive decay as well as many other natural phenomena, the
Planck constant , the Coulomb constant C, to
mention a few. The quantization of the atomic domain opened the door to a
fascinating and mysterious world where numbers ruled unchallenged.
Everything in the atom is governed by specific Quantum Numbers that

dictate how its internal structure, which includes the electrons, protons, and
neutrons, interacts and behave.

Some of these numbers are so special that they were labeled magical by the
scientists, such as the magical numbers of the nuclei [2, 10, 18, 36, 54, and
86]. And as we to discover, many of these numbers were already known and
admired for millennia, observed on the macroscopic level well before the
microcosmic one.
Figure 2: The golden section Φ  and the π constant embedded within the dimensions of the gates of
Egyptian temples.
 
With geometry, sound, and science, all united through numbers, the
layers of the divine encryption were complete, and it was the right moment
for the keys to be discovered and for the encryption to be deciphered.
Unfortunately, this complete knowledge came at a time when numbers were
stripped of their meaning and symbology, when they became mere tools and
digits of calculation. They were deprived of their true powers, their ability
to bring all the senses together and to unify all knowledge into one holistic
matrix.
In correspondence with this sterile attitude, schools and
universities’ curriculums were designed to intentionally omit the true
purpose of numbers, and the various scientific fields were torn apart,
specialized into narrower and narrower topics, which deprived the
knowledge seeker of experiencing the real aim of science and exploiting the
full benefits of its holistic approach. Fragmentation became the spirit of the
age.

Motivated by their love and appreciation for numbers and the
meaning they add to our understanding of the universe, the authors of this
book embarked on a journey of learning that took them across space and
time, where amazing discoveries were made and uncharted territories were
mapped. They joined forces to bring this knowledge to the general public
and to make it accessible to all. They believe that
now, more than ever, humanity is in dire need of letting go of its fragmented
mentality and embracing the natural holistic view of the universe. From this
context, the authors strived to make this book
accessible to the young and the old, the novice and the expert alike. They
used as simple language as possible, trying to avoid the complex and often
incomprehensible languages and terminology most advanced scientific
books are plagued with. In fact, the authors hold a strong conviction that
true knowledge can only be explained by the simplest of words. In addition,
plenty of illustrations were provided throughout the book to better explain
the ideas as well as to make sure that abstract concepts are always coupled
with visual inputs to create a permanent imprint of the absorbed
information.
The book is organized into four main parts corresponding to the
four layers of encryption mentioned above. The first part is about the
numbers and the mathematical ideas and theories upon which the rest of the
book stand. This is an essential part, and as we do not recommend skipping
any part or chapter in this book, this particular one, however, should be
thoroughly understood and definitely not to be skipped. The second part is
about geometry in general and its fundamental relationship with numbers. It
also concentrates on the topic of sacred geometry, which is the geometry of
shapes believed to have the most significant presence and effect on our
lives, and especially on their unique numeric properties. The third part is
about sound and music and the strong bonds they have with numbers and
geometry. The fourth part covers natural science, mainly the physics of the
atomic domain. In addition, it will be shown how the main forces of nature
emanate from and are ruled by the geo-numeric concepts explained in the
previous parts.
A fifth part is added to explore the extent to which the knowledge
of numbers and geometry have transcended the boundaries
of space and time by exploring their presence in the works of one of the
most visionaries of the renaissance age, that is Leonardi Da Vinci.

This book is a wonderful journey through which the reader will
confront novel ideas and uncharted scientific territories that will challenge
his long-held beliefs and expand his mind towards limits he never thought
possible. In the process, he will be rewarded with a completely new vision
and understanding, not only of numbers and science but also of his own
unique existence as well.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Part I
MATHEMATICS AND NUMBERS
 
“All is number.”
Pythagoras of Samos
 
We start the journey with the numeric and mathematical
foundations upon which this book stands. As mentioned in the introduction,
the theories and information provided in this chapter are essential for the
proper understanding of the rest of the book. They are mostly already
known and simple scientific concepts; however, we dwell on them,
expanding them into new territories that are uncharted by the orthodox
scientific cabal.
For example, the digital root of numbers is an already known
branch of number theory that has been studied for millennia. In this book,
however, we expand it into areas that are way ahead of any conventional
view on the subject, proving it to be a far more important discipline than
previously thought. And if the digital root math, in essence, is a well-known
field, a concept like the wave-particle duality has not been considered a
property that could be applied to simple numbers; it has been applied to
numerous physical phenomena, but not to pure digits. In this part, we show
how this bizarre and quintessential physical phenomenon does, in fact,
apply to, if not emanates from, the wave-particle duality of numbers
themselves. We will also investigate prime numbers in depth, numerically,
and, more importantly, geometrically, which is a must if we want to fully
understand these unique numbers. And while the reciprocal of numbers is
an operation that has been deemed trivial by most mathematicians, here,
however,
we show it to be one very important concept that definitely deserves deeper
study and investigation.
The above topics, and more, will be explained here and used
extensively throughout the book. They will serve as a blueprint through
which we will be able to navigate the reader into uncharted territories of
math and numbers that are so essential to our correct understanding not
only of mathematics but most physical sciences as well.

Chapter 1: The Digital Root
 
“Mathematics is the queen of the sciences
and number theory is the queen of mathematics.”
- Carl Friedrich Gauss
 
i-                   Math and Properties
 
We begin our math and numbers discussion by explaining the
fundamentals of the digital root as it will be used extensively throughout the
book.
The digital root, also known as modular math, is one important
branch of number theory. It has many applications, especially in the field of
digital security and encryption. Modular math can work with any numerical
base, e.g., base-10, base-12, base-60, etc. In this book, however, we
concentrate mainly on base-10 (which is actually base-9, as explained
below.)              
In simple words, what the digital root operation does is to reduce a
number down to a single digit. This is done by continuously summing the
number’s individual digits. For example, the digital root of 5432 is
calculated as: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 14 = 1 + 4 = 5. The possible outcome of this
operation can be any number from 1 to 9 only (this is why we suggested it
is more of a base-9 rather than base-10).
Under this operation, we can think of numbers occupying a wheel
of 9 spokes and segments (better known as moduli, plural form of modulus)
where numbers from 1 to infinity are distributed around the nine moduli. In
this configuration, each modulus houses only those numbers with the same
digital root, as shown in the figure below.
Before we proceed, few notes on the digital root terminology we
will be using throughout the book: the letter D indicates taking the digital
root of the number, e.g., D(13) means: take the digital root of number 13.
The term D-sum refers to the digital root of the sum of a group of numbers.
So, D-sum(13, 14, 15) = D(13+14+15) = D(42) = 6. And the D-space term
refers to the space of the digital root operation, where numbers range from
1 to 9 only.
Below we explain the most basic algebraic operations within the
logic of the digital root math.

 
Figure 3: The digital root wheel. Those numbers that have the same digital root will occupy the same
modulus.

And 
It is obvious that the digital root of any irrational number is
undefined, like in the case of π, for example, where D(π) =
D(3.14159265…). And because π is infinite, its digital root is something
that cannot be calculated.
 
Multiplication

 Example:

And 

 

Subtraction
Rule: 
If

Division
The division operation works fine for most numbers but not always,
e.g., when we divide by number 7. (Generally, in modular math, the
division operation depends on the greatest common divisor between the
numbers involved and the numeric base. However, we will keep it simple
here as it is not much needed in the context of the book.)
Example: 
 
and 
 
and 
.
Dividing by 7 is a special case, where the result is always a
repetitive sequence of the numbers: [1, 4, 2, 8, 5, 7]. These six digits [1, 4,
2, 8, 5, 7] are called the Septenary Numbers, and we will be encountering
them a lot throughout the book.
 
Number 9: The Zero of the D-space
Even though number 9 is the last and largest number of the D-
space, it behaves in this finite space as number 0 does in the regular
infinite numerical space. For example, adding 9 to any number will not
change its digital root, just like adding zero to any number has no effect
on 
that 
number 
either, 
e.g., 
, 
and 
. Furthermore, the
digital root of multiplying any number with the number 9 will always be
9, just like multiplying zero with any number, and no matter how large
it is, reduces it to zero, e.g., 
. This property
of number 9, being the largest and smallest at the same time, is unique
to the D-space and has some interesting implications, as we discover
later on.
Throughout the ages, the number 9 used to symbolize
completion; it is the number that ends cycles of times, bringing one age
to an end before a new era begins, as in the procession of the equinox,
which is the movement of the zodiacal signs behind the rising sun.
Every 72 years (D = 9), the zodiacs move one degree from their
previous year’s position.  For a full cycle, it takes around 25920 years

(360×72), and D(28920) = 9. Currently, we are entering or already in
the age of Aquarius.
Berossus, the Babylonian priest who lived around the 3rd
century BC, listed the ten Sumerian antediluvian kings, showing them
all to had ruled for periods whose digital roots are 9.

In Greek mythology, Zeus inflicted a great flood on Earth to
wipe out humanity, which lasted 9 days. In the Bible, Noah is stated as
the 9th patriarch before the great deluge engulfed Earth. Similarly, all the
Mayan time periods have digital roots of 9, as well as the Hindus Yugas:
Satya Yuga = 1728000 years, Treta Yuga = 1296000 years, Dwarpa
Yuga = 864000 years, and Kali Yuga = 432000 years.

Whether these periods are real or not, it doesn’t matter; what really
matters is the role number 9 plays in completing all these cycles, the one
numeric property believed by all civilizations around the world. There is
definitely something fundamental about this number that is deeply rooted in
humanity’s subconscious, and this book may shine a light on the reason.
 
 
 
 
 

ii-                The Basic D-Circle
 
As we saw in the previous chapter, numbers in the D-space do not
keep increasing towards infinity; instead, they go around from 1 to 9 back
to 1 in an infinite loop. In doing so, they form circles (or spirals) like the
one shown below, which exhibit many interesting properties.
For example, numbers [3, 6, 9] divide the circle into three equal
segments where the D-sum of the numbers in each segment is also 3, 6, and
9: 1+2 = 3 , 4+5 = 9 and D(8+7) = D(15) = 6. Moreover, the D-sum of
every two numbers facing each other across every diameter is the same. For
example, the D-sum of each two numbers facing across the diameter that
starts with 9 (which I call the 9-symmetry line) is equal to 9: 1+8, 2+7, 3+6,
4+5 (as shown in the same figure); across the 3-symmetry line is 6: 2+4,
1+5, 9+6, 8+7; across the 6-symmetry line is 3; across the 1-symmetry line
is 2, and so on. The rule is: numbers across any symmetry line will add up
to double the number associated with that line. Moreover, numbers [3, 6, 9]
divide the circle into three segments, with the D-sum in each segment is
equal to [3, 6, 9] as well.
Figure 4: The nine digits of the D-space repeats in a circular or spiraling fashion. Numbers [3, 6, 9]
divide the circle into three parts where the D-sum of the numbers in each is also 3, 6, and 9.
 
If we started with number 1 on the basic D-circle, drawing a line to
number 2, doubling our steps on the way, we go to number 4, then 8.
Doubling again gives us 16, with a digital root of 7, so we connect to 7.

Doubling more gives 2×16 = 32 with a D of 5, then 64 with a D of 1, which
brings us back to our starting point. Doubling more takes us

along the same path again, ad infinitum. In the process, we traced a V-shape
(or the infinity symbol ∞) made of the numbers: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8], the same
septenary numbers we saw earlier in the previous section. Throughout the
doubling process, the group of [3, 6, 9] becomes isolated from the rest. The
doubling of this group is also different as 3 doubles to 6, which doubles to 3
back, and so on. Number 9 doubles into itself only.
 
Figure 5: Within the D-space, the doubling process starts from number 1, going to numbers 2, 4, 8, 7,
5, and back to number 1 again.
 
Arranging the six digits of the doubling operation around a circle in
their exact order (2, 4, 8, 7, 5, 1) leaves even numbers on one side of the
circle and odd ones on the other. Odd and even represent the numeric
aspects of the opposing forces of the universe, similar to the Yin-Yang
concept of the Tao philosophy, which symbolizes the duality that exists in
the universe: water and fire; wet and dry; dark and light; male and female,
etc.
In order to maintain the harmony and balance of the whole
universe, these opposing forces intertwine and overlap with each other in a
circular or wave-like pattern, as in the Yin-Yang symbol, shown below. The
two small white and black circles represent each force's existence within its
opposite, nullifying the absolute purity of each force while elaborating on
the need each one has for the other to complete itself.
We can rephrase the above logic numerically by noticing that when
we add the even numbers together (2+4+8), we get 14, which has a digital

root of 5, an odd number. Doing the same for the odd ones D(1+5+7) results
in number 4, which is even. This is why these numbers are positioned at the
centers of the small circles.

Furthermore, adding the odd and even D-sums to each other (4+5) results in
number 9, a number that brings completion. Adding up the diagonal
numbers generates number 9 as well: 1+8, 2+7, and 4+5. Thus these
opposing aspects need each other to become complete in a conditional
unity. (This specific completion property will prove essential for our
understanding of the universe, especially when we discuss the atomic
domain.)
 
Figure 6: The Yin-Yang symbol of the opposing aspects of nature, expressed via a perfect numerical
language.
 
The above numeric correspondence is just one example of many
that illustrate how simple numbers and their digital roots can verify ancient
wisdom. Everything in the universe, from forces to matter to physical laws,
has its own numeric correspondence. Numbers are the universal language;
we only need to learn how to read it.
 
 
 
 
 
 

Chapter 2: Prime Numbers
 
“Mathematicians have tried in vain to this day to discover some order in
the sequence of prime numbers, and we have reason to believe that it is a
mystery into which the human mind will never penetrate.”
          -Leonhard Euler
 
i-                   Prime Numbers: Properties and Distribution
 
As we saw earlier, numbers can be either odd or even. But this is
not their only categorization; they can also be prime or composite, integers
or floats, rational or irrational (or transcendental), etc. Nevertheless,
primeness is one of, if not the most important of these categories. By
definition, a prime number is exactly divisible (with no remainder) by
number 1 and itself only. Everything else is considered composite. And
while prime numbers are always odd (except for number 2), composite
numbers can be either odd or even. The first few prime numbers are: [2, 3,
5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83,
89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163,
167, 173, 179, ...]
The number 1 is not considered a prime by most mathematicians.
This is because it is much easier to prove many of their mathematical
properties if it is excluded. (Hence, number 1 can be considered a category
by itself, neither prime nor composite.)
As is evident from this sequence, the frequency of prime numbers
gets smaller and smaller as we continue towards bigger numbers. Still, no
exact mathematical formula can predict their occurrences or able to
generate them all. Some formulas can generate a few of them, but
eventually, they all fail at some point. Thus, in addition to lacking factors,
they also lack a mathematical pattern. This unique quality, among many
others, made prime numbers ideal for encryption and security purposes,
e.g., in credit card information and secure internet surfing. Basically, this is
because multiplying a couple of very large prime numbers to create an even
larger number (called semiprime) is an easy and fast operation. However,
figuring out which prime factors are implemented in producing the
semiprime is a very hard and lengthy process.
Even if there is no specific mathematical expression able to
generate all prime numbers, this doesn’t mean their distribution is

completely random. As we just mentioned, besides number 2, all prime
numbers are odd because any even number can be exactly divisible by 2,
and therefore, it is no longer a prime. Also, it is well known that

the last digit of any prime number greater than 5 can only be 1, 3, 7, or 9.
Numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8 are excluded to ensure that the number is odd. The
number 5 is also excluded because any number ending with 5 will be
divisible by 5.
Mathematically, prime numbers always come in the form of 
, where k is any integer from 1 to infinity. Of course, not all k values
produce prime numbers; otherwise, this formula would have been
considered a perfect generator of these numbers. From this formula, it
appears that number 6 is a pivot or a center number around which prime
numbers emerge. This specific role of number 6 is so fundamental that it
will be at the core of some of this book's most important theories.
Even though the above formula is not a perfect prime-generator, it
can still be used to prove other prime-related properties. One such
interesting property is that for any prime number p, its square is always a
multiple of 24, plus 1 (
). This can be proven as follows: the
factor k in 
 can be either even or odd, so we write it as 2m for even
and 2m+1 for odd. Next, we substitute these values in the main equation
and raise it to the power of 2, which results in four forms for p2:  
. When the squared
terms are expanded, we get four terms that involve the number 24
multiplied by some factor of m, plus 1, such as 
 and so
on for the other three. If we combine 
 into a single factor f, we
retrieve the desired equation: 
.
Another prime-property is that in the D-space, with the exception of
number 3, the digital root of any known prime number is anything but 3, 6,
or 9. To prove this claim, we start with the fact that 
. Now,
if p has a digital root of 3, 6, or 9, then D(p2) = 9, always. On the right side
of the equality, D(24) = 6 and D(k×6) = [3, 6, 9] always. (This can be
checked by looking at the digital root of the multiplication table, also
known as the Vedic Square, shown in the table below.) By adding 1 to the
right side of the above equality, we have [3 or 6 or 9] + 1 = [4, 7, 1],
always. Therefore, we can never get the number 9 on both sides of the
equation, and consequently, no prime number can have a digital root of 3, 6,

or 9. Thus, if we want to know whether a number is prime or not, we first
make sure it is even, and if so, check its digital root. If it is either 3, 6, or 9,
then the number is definitely not a prime. Otherwise, then there is a
possibility of primness.

Table 2: The digital roots of the multiplication table for numbers from 1 to 9, also known as the Vedic Square. Notice that multiplying any number
by 3, 6, or 9 will generate a digital root of 3, 6, and 9.
 
 
Figure 7: The Vedic Square was used to check calculations’ validity as well as to generate interesting geometric patterns by highlighting specific
numbers and then connecting the cells containing these numbers. Shapes that correspond to numbers adding up to 9, as [2, 7], [1, 8], etc., are mirror
images of each other. Tracing number 9 generates a square, which is its own mirror image.
 
There are many methods to generate prime numbers. One famous method is the Sieve of Eratosthenes,
attributed to the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes of Cyrene (276-195 BC), which offers an easy but lengthy
trick to find all prime numbers that are less than a certain number. For example, to find the prime numbers
within the range from 1 to 42, we first write these numbers in a grid, as shown below.

Table 3: The Sieve of Eratosthenes’ grid for picking prime numbers in the range from 1 to 42.
 
Next, we take out all numbers that are multiples of 2 (besides 2, all
primes are odd). This will exclude [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, …, 42] from
the grid. Then we take out all the numbers that are multiples of the number
that comes after 2, which is 3, so we take out: [9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 13]. This is
because, after number 3, no other number should be divisible by 3, or it will
not be prime. We keep doing the same for the next numbers of 5, 6, and 7.
The first multiple of 7 after 35 is 49, which is bigger than 42, and
consequently does not belong to the grid. Hence, the remaining numbers are
the prime numbers that lie within the range 1 to 42: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,
19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41] (excluding the number 1 of course).  
Notice from the above grid how all prime numbers fall within the
1st and 5th columns only. This is because those falling in the 2nd and 4th
columns are even, and those falling in the 3rd and 6th columns all have
digital roots of [3, 6, 9]. As we will see shortly, when numbers are
distributed in columns or moduli whose numbering is a multiple of 6, prime
numbers will occupy specific moduli that follow unique geometrical
patterns.
Another prime pattern that is geometric in its essence is found by
Stanislaw Ulam (1909-1984 AD), a Polish mathematician who discovered
that by plotting numbers in a spiraling sequence, prime numbers tend to line
themselves on diagonal lines, as shown below.

Figure 8: Ulam spiral. By plotting prime numbers in a spiraling form, prime numbers fall on diagonal
lines.

In recent years, scientists and mathematicians have found more
complex orders hidden within the ostensibly random distribution of prime
numbers. One such order has been discovered by two mathematicians from
Stanford University, Kannan Soundararajan and Robert Lemke Oliver.  As
we have seen, one known property of prime numbers is that they must end
with either 1, 3, 7, or 9. So, if prime numbers occur in a purely random
fashion, it shouldn’t matter what the last digit of the previous prime is to the
next one; each one of the four possibilities should have an equal 25%
chance of appearing at the end of the next prime number.  However, this is
not what they have found. After looking for the first 400 billion primes,
they found that prime numbers tend to avoid having the same last digit as
their immediate prime predecessor. As Dr. Oliver put it, they behave as if
they “really hate to repeat themselves.” Moreover, they found that primes
ending with 3 tend to be followed by those ending with 9, instead of 1 and
7. (This behavior may be explained through the digital root operation, as
will be explained later.)
Another recent and surprising prime-order was discovered by the
theoretical chemist and Princeton professor Salvatore Torquato. Prof.
Torquato had the idea of looking at what diffraction patterns prime numbers
would produce if they were to be modeled as atom-like particles. He
observed that not only do prime numbers create a quasicrystal-like
interference pattern, but the pattern itself is also a self-symmetry fractal that
has never been observed before, which he labeled effectively limit-periodic.
Prof. Torquato stated that: “There is much more order in prime numbers
than ever previously discovered.”
It is evident from the above that prime numbers are not really
pattern-less. On the contrary, there are so many conditions and rules that
dictate their distribution, especially in regards to number 6. And it is in the
geo-numeric space, when geometry and numbers are combined, that their
hidden patterns become visible, as we explore next.

ii-                The 24-Wheel and Quasi Primes
 
In his book God’s Secret Formula, Dr. Peter Plichta showed that by
distributing numbers around concentric circles, 24 in each, prime numbers
will position themselves along specific diameters or moduli, making a
shape that looks like a Maltese cross or a plus sign. The pattern is infinite
and can be proven as follows: any number on the 2nd modulus can be
written in the form of 2 + 24h = 2(1+12h), where h is an integer from 0 to
infinity, and therefore it will always be divisible by 2. Consequently, it
cannot be a prime. The same logic applies to Moduli 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12,
14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, and 22, leaving the remaining eight moduli, the
prime moduli, as the only placeholders for prime numbers. Those primes
that reside on the same arm of the plus sign and differ by two are called
Twin Primes, while those that reside on adjacent arms and differ by four are
called Cousin Primes.
 
Figure 9: Prime numbers distribution around a 24-moduli circle will occupy moduli that form the
shape of a Maltese cross.
 
In general, prime numbers will form shapes having a symmetry equal to the
number of moduli, divided by six. So, for the above example, prime

numbers form a cross, and 
 . When numbers are distributed around a
30-moduli wheel, prime numbers will form

a pentagon (5) as 
, and so on. This is, of course, a consequence of the
property mentioned earlier, where any prime number comes in the form of 
.
The 24-based distribution appears to possess unique properties
when compared to others. For example, all prime-squared numbers reside
within the 1st module only. This is not the case for other distributions, even
if they are based on number 6, like 18 or 30, etc. This behavior emanates
from the fact that squaring any prime number will always result in a
multiple of 24, plus 1.
Those numbers residing along the prime moduli (the 1st, 5th, 7th,
11th, 13th, 17th, 19th, and 23rd spokes of the wheel) fall within three main
categories:
1-     Prime numbers,
2-     Squared primes, and
3-     Quasi-prime numbers.
 
Quasi-prime is a new category of numbers defined as the product of
semiprimes and/or primes bigger or equal to 5. They include numbers such
as 55, 175, 245. Notice that they are all odd numbers and are factorized by
numbers residing on the prime-moduli only.  Additionally, quasi-primes
possess the major distinction from semiprimes in that they exclude the
numbers 2 and 3 as one of their prime factors. In this sense, they possess
certain properties similar to semiprimes, not being actual primes
themselves; still, they retain a degree of primeness.
An in-depth analysis of the 24-distribution wheel reveals that the
numbers on the prime moduli are self-contained within these moduli. In
other words, one can form a multiplication grid (Q-grid), like the one
shown below, where the horizontal and vertical lines
consist of prime numbers and semiprimes, e.g., 7, 11, 25, 35, etc. The
resultant grid contains all the numbers within the prime moduli that are not
prime. Consequently, any number that resides within the prime moduli, and
is not contained within the multiplication grid, is certainly a prime.
Notice that the diagonal numbers of the grid work as a mirror, with
those numbers on top being mirror reflections to those below. Additionally,

this line's digital roots follow a repeated sequence of 174471 174471…,
made from the numeric group of [1, 4, 7] only.

Table 4: The Q-grid for numbers from 5 to 31.
 
Thus, theoretically speaking, the above Q-grid enables us to test the
primality of any number with 100% accuracy and without the need to
implement complicated techniques. It also enables us to predict new primes
by simply filtering those numbers residing within the prime-moduli while
not appearing as products within the Q-grid. It will also enable a faster
prime factorization, which we explore next.
 
Primality Testing and Prime Factorization
Prime factorization, finding the prime factors of a certain number,
is not a complicated problem in principle. However, when it comes to huge
numbers, the process becomes very difficult. This is why semiprime
numbers are implemented in many modern encryption techniques.
Therefore, factorization is considered a very important problem as by
making semiprimes easier to factorize, we render many encryption
solutions useless, which jeopardizes a huge sector of online businesses and
personal information.
There are many methods to test the primality of numbers. The
simplest of which is the trial division method, where if the tested number n
is found to be evenly divisible by any prime number from 2 to 
, then it is,
by default, not a prime, and vice versa.

Other methods are considered more probabilistic than exact, with the tested
numbers subjected to some rigorous criteria, and if they pass, then they are
considered most probably prime, such as the Fermat Primality test
combined with Fibonacci or Lucas primality tests.
The Q-grid provides another exact method that has the ability to
reduce the time for primality testing considerably. To do the testing, we start
by checking whether a number n passes the initial primeness-criteria: being
odd, having last-digit of [1, 3, 7 or 9], and digital root not equal to [3, 6, 9],
etc.  Once it passes, n is easily tested as to whether it falls along any of the
prime moduli of the chosen s-sides polygon or not. So, for s = 6, the prime
should fall in either modulus 1 or 5. For s = 24, as is the case we are
considering, the prime-moduli are: 1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23, etc. By
taking into consideration all the above, we have reduced the dimensionality
of the problem considerably, selecting eight moduli only from a total of
twenty-four, eliminating in the process 2/3 of the numbers’ space that
requires searching. Next, we proceed to the final step; to check whether the
number belongs to the Q-prime grid or not. If the original number n is
found within the grid, then it is not a prime. Otherwise, it is prime by
definition.
Now, if the number n resides along or close to the reflection line of
the Q-grid, then primality confirmation is simple. We only need to look for
numbers at or close to 
 on both axes of the grid. These two numbers will
define two small strips that intersect on a small area where we need to look
for this number. Beyond this area, numbers either get larger or smaller than
n. On the other hand, if the number n is far from the reflection line, then
solving the problem requires more complex analysis. Thus, devising
algorithms that can search for these numbers without the need to calculate
large portions of the Q-grid is an important step in refining and optimizing
primality confirmation results.
Similar to the case of primality testing, performing prime
factorization using the Q-grid method requires the implementation of a
search algorithm that is programmed based on the search criterion we
mentioned earlier, along with other supporting conditional statements that
exploit the geometry of the Q-grid. The problem's geometrical aspect will
be explained further in Part III, where we discuss the many interesting and
novel methods we have discovered in the process, which in return,

rewarded us with so much insight into not only this specific problem but
into so many aspects of the physical reality as well.

iii-             Quadrant Symmetries
 
Aside from its primality and factorization capabilities, the 24-based icositetragon wheel and its prime
moduli projection, the Q-grid, provide an interesting insight into the relationships numbers have with each other.
By projecting the numbers of the eight prime moduli onto the Q-grid, shown below, we discover some interesting
behavior. Notice how those Quasi-primes belonging to the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 8th prime moduli continue along the grid
without interruption (black lines), while those of the 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th moduli (dashed lines) are interrupted either
by each other or by the other four prime moduli. Thus, there is a sense of symmetry breaking between the
horizontal and vertical prime moduli that is not obvious from the geometrical symmetry of the icositetragon wheel.

Table 5: Tracing the prime moduli on the Q-grid reveals symmetry breaking between the North/South (solid lines) and East/West (dotted lines) moduli.
 
By examining the northern, eastern, and western central axes of the wheel, we find an interesting
complementary property. Aided by the figure below, we see that numbers on the east and west moduli add

up to every other number on the northern modulus only. For example,
numbers 6 and 18 on the horizontal axis add up to 24 on the vertical axes,
30 + 42 = 72, 54 + 66 = 120, and so on. The southern modulus is excluded
from this property, which is another asymmetric behavior.
 
Figure 10: East-West central moduli add up to every other number on the northern central modulus.
 
Additionally, the northern and southern central moduli complement
each other, where two numbers on these moduli add up to produce a
number on the southern one only, as illustrated below. So, on the vertical
axis we find: 24 + 12 = 36, 72 + 60 = 132, etc. The East-West central
moduli, on the other hand, don’t exhibit the same behavior.
 
Figure 11: North-South moduli complementary property: adding two numbers from the north-south
moduli generates a number belonging to the south modulus only.

Below is an illustration of another complementary property where
numbers on two prime moduli add up to a non-prime number on the central
moduli. For example, prime numbers 77 and 79 add up to 156, which lies
on the southern central modulus. Also, 12 = 5 + 7, 24 = 13 + 11, 24 = 23 +
1, 36 = 19 + 17, 60 = 29 + 31, etc.
Figure 12: Prime numbers on the prime moduli adding up to composite numbers on the central
moduli.
 
It is obvious from the above analysis that the icositetragon (24-
sided polygon) numerical configuration has a quadrant nature. These
quadrants are defined by the primary horizontal and vertical central moduli
that, at the same time, work as complementary axes where the numbers on
the central moduli possess complementary relationships with numbers on
other central moduli (Figures 10 & 11), as well as with numbers belonging
to the prime moduli (Figure 12) as explained above.
Quadrant symmetry is something we encounter in many fields of
physics and mathematics, such as in the complex plane where the real and
imaginary axes define a similar configuration, with the quadrants on the
negative side often being a continuation or reflection of those on the
positive side, as proposed by the complex function continuity theorem.

Also, propagating electromagnetic waves define a similar quadrant plane, as
we will see later on.

Now, intrinsic to any coherent quadrant configurations is the existence of
relationship or symmetry between the elements of each quadrant, i.e.,
having a reflection symmetry around the horizontal and/or vertical axes.
This is also the case for the numeric icositetragon wheel, as each integer on
the central moduli and the prime moduli that surround them possesses
circular-complementary relationships with numbers on other moduli such
that they add up to 360 (or multiples of 360) and are, therefore, parts of the
same quadrant integer set. The figure below explains this mirroring
relationship between the four members of a quadrant set.
 
Figure 13: Definition of the mirroring complementary relationship between a set of four numbers
with A being a member of the set.
 
We explain the above quadrant symmetry through an example.
Taking number 341 on the 5th modulus, its complementary number 19 is
found in the opposite mirrored 19th modulus (5+19 = 24) when reflecting
across the central vertical moduli (24 and 12). This is because 341+ 19 =
360. The two additional complements, 161 and 199, are reflected through
the horizontal moduli (moduli 6 and 18). Notice how number 199 is
complementary to number 19, and so is number 341 to 161. In other words,
199 -19 = 180 = 341-161. These two numbers are part of the same quadrant
set not only because 161+199 = 360 but also because these four numbers
unify the degree and decimal references when they are referenced around a
unit circle, as shown below.

 
Figure 14: The angular relationships between the four numbers belonging to one complementary set.
In this example, 199 ◦ is a continuation of 19 ◦, and so is 341 ◦ of 161 ◦.
 
Dividing the decimal numbers by 360 creates a normalized
reference for the set where the numbers add up to 1 instead of 360. We can
also give these decimal references signs that define their position on the
unitary circle and maintain a balance of 0 around the whole circle.  This is
shown in the figure below for the set [(43, 317), (137, 223)].
 
Figure 15: Normalized relationship for one complementarity set [(43, 317), (137, 223)] along with
the decimal references and signs attributions.

 
For numbers beyond 360, the same complementary properties
apply; however, the numbers will add up to n×360 where n is an integer
equal to 1 for the first 360 numbers, 2 for the next 360 numbers, and so on.
The quadrant relationships are better observed when we look at the
trigonometric values of their reference angles, as illustrated in the figure
below. The values between the brackets are for the cosine, sine, and tangent
of the angles, respectively (und. stands for undefined, e.g., irrational
values). Notice how they are mirrored across the quadrants, differing only
by a ± sign.
 
 
Figure 16: Trigonometric values for three different sets of quadrant-angles mirrored across the four
quadrants, differing only with their ± signs.
 
There are also complementary symmetries corresponding to central
moduli numbers, continuing ad infinitum in multiples of 360 or 180, in a
cyclic pattern, as shown below.

 
Figure 17: Numbers on the horizontal moduli complete to 360 ◦ (Left), and numbers on the vertical
moduli complete to multiples of 180 ◦ (Right).
All these symmetric and asymmetric numeric relationships are a
consequence of the 2-dimensional geometric configuration of numbers and
cannot easily be observed in their 1-dimensional linear form. And while the
symmetric relationships can be explained via the wheel’s geometry, the
asymmetric ones cannot be easily explained, especially when they involve
the same axes of symmetry.
All the above hints to an evident conclusion: that numbers are
geometric in nature, and their affinity to circles is most obvious. Their real
powers, properties, relationships, etc., are observed and make sense only
when they are distributed circularly instead of linearly. This is something
we observed early on in the D-space, as only when numbers are distributed
around circles that their numeric symmetries and relationships become
readily apparent and meaningful.
Therefore, it makes no sense to separate numbers and geometry
from each other; they should always be studied together as a coherent
entity. It is only through this geo-numeric domain that scientific mysteries
can be discovered and solved.

Chapter 3: Magical Numbers
 
“The wisest and noblest teacher is nature itself.”
Leonardo da Vinci
 
 
Throughout the ages, many numbers, whether individual ones, like
the golden section, or a set of them, like the Fibonacci sequence, were given
a paramount status among all other numbers. They were so revered to the
extent that they were labeled magical.
Magic is a word we usually associate with things or events that we
cannot explain in a reasonable or scientific manner. It is a process where
one thing transforms into another when no such transformation is believed
to be allowed. Many of what the ancient believed to be real magic were
mostly based on scientific tricks performed by magicians or priests in front
of ignorant or uninformed crowds.
Nowadays, magic became the art of the invisible tricks, and where
the observer is amazed by how the magic trick is done, much more than the
magical event itself. In the scientific realm, mathematicians will label a
number magical if it has certain properties that make it unique but only in a
purely mathematical and algebraic sense. On the other hand, a physicist will
call a number or a set of them magical if nature seems to prefer it/them in
its design, such as the so-called magical numbers corresponding to the
nucleus's energy states.
But even if scientists sometimes call some numbers magical, they
do not mean it literally. For them, these numbers are just a consequence of
the laws of nature; the magic label is just an unintentional misnomer. 
For the scientists and philosophers of the past, on the other hand,
when they observe a pattern, a shape, or a number that is repeated in nature
in different areas and at different levels, they would consider it unique and
magical, manifested in nature to reflect the divine design and wisdom. They
would try to understand it, imitate it, and use it
whenever they could because in doing so, they would be reflecting its
divine beauty and purpose within their own work, which becomes vibrant
and harmonious. In other words, they believed that these numbers would
magically transform their earthly creation into a heavenly one.

 
In simple words, what is widely observed in the natural world and
fundamental to its design, whether a number or a shape, is what considered
meaningful and important to the intelligence behind its creation, and
consequently, what is considered magical to the ancients. And this is
precisely why these numbers are studied here, showing them to be much
more magical than ever believed.

i-                   The Golden Ratio
 
There is no other number revered as magical more than the golden
ratio. Mathematically, it is defined as the cut on a line where the ratio of the
larger piece to the smaller one is the same as the ratio of the whole to the
larger piece, as shown below.
 
Figure 18: The golden ratio is found by cutting a line into two segments, where the ratio of the bigger
piece to the smaller one equals that of the whole to the bigger piece.
 
The numerical value of this amazing number (usually referred to as
the Greek letter Φ ) is the same no matter what the length of the line is, just
like number π has the same value no matter what the diameter of the circle
is. And similar to most fundamental constant, such as π and e, Φ  is an
irrational number; a number that continues to infinity and without repetition
(π and e are even more irrational than Φ , as where Φ  can be generated
from an algebraic equation, they cannot. These types of numbers are called
transcendental.)
The magical status of the Φ  constant stems from its unique
mathematical properties as well as its ubiquitous presence in the natural
world. This is because the golden section Φ , along with its mathematical
variations such as 1/ Φ  = 0.618… and Φ 2 = 2.618… are embedded within
the many natural laws and patterns that govern growth and proportions. For
example, Φ  is found in the proportions of the human body, such as the
face, arms, torso, etc. Every double helix DNA measures 34 angstroms long
by 21 wide, with their ratio being 1.619, very close to Φ .
Also, the golden section is embedded within the design of every
pentagon and pentagram where each of the five small triangles that make up
the pentagram (or the large ones that define the pentagon) is a golden
triangle, with the ratios of the sides to the base being Φ  exactly, as shown
below. This fundamental relationship between Φ  and the pentagon stems

from its mathematical expression, which involves the square root of number
5: Φ  = 
.

 
Figure 19: The golden section Φ  defines the proportions of every pentagon or pentagram.
 
If we continuously placed golden triangles inside each other, as
shown below, and then draw a curve connecting the tips of each triangle, we
generate what is known as the golden spiral. These types of spirals are
called logarithmic spirals, defined by maintaining their proportions with
every wind (they are different from Archimedean spirals, which maintain
the distances between their arms instead.)
The golden spiral is found everywhere in the natural world, from
the spiraling forms of many creatures, like the shell of the nautilus, to the
horns of some animals, to the spiraling arms of galaxies, etc.
 
Figure 20: The golden spiral formed from connecting the tips of adjacent golden triangles, all defined
by the golden section Φ .

Another geometrical aspect of Φ  is the golden rectangle, where
the ratio between its two sides is Φ , as shown below, left. And similar to
the golden triangle, we can trace a golden spiral within embedded golden
rectangles.
 
Figure 21: A golden rectangle with dimensions b and c and where c/b = Φ . It nests a golden spiral
created from embedded golden rectangles.
 
Many ancient civilizations, like the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the
Mesopotamians, etc., implemented Φ  in their architectures and drawings
by incorporating the golden rectangles within their works. This is because
whenever a painting or a monument is designed with Φ  in mind, it will
look harmonious and more pleasing to the gazer. One example is the
famous Babylonian Tablet of Shamash, dating back to the 9th century BC,
where the golden rectangle is embedded within the many elements of its
design, as shown below.
 

Figure 22: The Babylonian Tablet of Shamash (9th century BC) is designed such that its dimensions
reflect the golden rectangle. (Was this an intentional design, or simply these dimensions resonated
with its maker?)

Many renaissance painters used Φ  in their paintings, such as in Leonardo
Da Vinci’s The Last Supper or in Sandro Botticelli’s famous work The Birth
of Venus. Even in music, some composers arranged their pieces based on
Φ , believing it to make their music profound and more enjoyable, which
include Dufay, Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, to mention a few.
 
Figure 23: The Vasilissa of Guillaume Dufay (1397-1474) is almost completely based on the golden
section.
 
So, whether numerically or geometrically, naturally or artificially,
the golden section exists in almost everything around us. Its beautiful
mathematical and geometrical properties make it the preferred proportion
through which nature expresses itself. And later on in the book, when we
discuss the wave nature of numbers, we show that the golden section is not
only one of the most important constants in nature; it may very well be the
origin of all other constants as well.

ii-                The Fibonacci Sequence
 
Fibonacci numbers were known since the time of Ancient Egypt.
Their current name is attributed to the man who introduced them to Europe,
Leonardo of Pisa, aka Fibonacci (1170-1250 AD). He is reputed to have
discovered this sequence of numbers while studying the theoretical growth-
rate of rabbits. Starting from a single couple, represented by [1, 1], each
successive number is then generated by the summation of the two previous
ones, generating a sequence as follows:  [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89,
144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, …]. Note how numbers 21 and 34 that
define the scaling of the DNA belong to Fibonacci’s sequence.
Interestingly, the golden section and Fibonacci numbers can be
generated from each other, as the ratio of each two successive Fibonacci
numbers converges to the exact value of the golden section, more so as we
move towards larger numbers: 3/2 = 1.5, 5/3 =1.666..., 8/5 = 1.6, 13/8 =
1.625, 21/13 = 1.61538…, 144/89 = 1.61797... Eventually, the ratio
converges very closely to 1.6180… (Interestingly, if we take the ratio of the
24th and 23rd Fibonacci numbers, the value matches up the golden section
string up to 9 digits after the comma: 46368/28657 = 1.618033988… So,
we can say that at the 24th number of Fibonacci, we achieve one complete
cycle of matching with the golden section.) In reverse, the Fibonacci
sequence can be calculated from the golden section by simple mathematical
relations, as shown in the table below. When we remember that Φ  is an
irrational number while Fibonacci numbers are rational and exact, this
correspondence becomes much more interesting.

The Fibonacci Spiral
The real power of Fibonacci’s sequence does not emanate from the
sequence’s numerical aspect only, but more importantly, from the
geometrical pattern its numbers

form, the spiral, which is used extensively by nature in arranging and
packing its constituents. A logarithmic Fibonacci spiral can be traced inside
a sequence of adjacent squares having Fibonacci numbers for the
dimensions of their sides, as shown below. (Notice that this spiral is not the
same as the golden spiral as here we have squares in place of golden
rectangles.) This geometrical aspect is unique to the Fibonacci sequence-;
as we will see in the next chapter, Lucas numbers are generated using the
same exact logic used in Fibonacci; however, they do not form geometrical
patterns.)
 
Figure 24: Adjacent squares whose dimensions follow the Fibonacci sequence define a perfect
logarithmic spiral.
 
Plants exhibit Fibonacci numbers in their spiraling forms and in the
numbers of these spirals. Artichokes, for example, have clockwise and
counterclockwise spirals that are numbered in a Fibonacci sequence: 5
clockwise and 8 counterclockwise. Pineapples also exhibit these numbers in
their 3-fold spiraling scales; 8, 13, and 21, and so is the case for the heads
of sunflowers, among many others.
When we take the digital root of the Fibonacci sequence, a cyclic
pattern emerges with the digits repeating themselves in a 24-fold cycle as
follows: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 3, 7, 1, 8, 9, 8, 8, 7, 6, 4, 1, 5, 6, 2, 8, 1, 9].
Remember number 24 from the previous chapters, where the 24-moduli
wheel exhibited interesting properties, especially in regard to prime
numbers. This is another very important place where this number is hidden
in plain sight; we only needed the digital root to reveal it. 
When these 24 digits are plotted around a circle (shown below), the
D-circle exhibits many interesting geo-numeric symmetries. For example,
every two numbers on the same diameter complete to 9, along with two

groups of 3-6-9 segmentations and their corresponding 3-6-9 D-sums, as
shown around the same circle.

The perfectness of these 24 numbers in their geo-numeric
symmetries is as elegant as intriguing. If only one number differed from its
exact value, the symmetries' wholeness would have been broken. Notice
also the perfect triangulation of the group of numbers [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], and
[3, 6, 9], with the members of each group, collectively or individually,
placed around equilateral triangles. This differentiation of the first nine
numbers into these three groups is an observation of utmost importance,
which we will repeatedly witness throughout the book.
Figure 25: The 24-based D-circle of the Fibonacci sequence. Every two numbers on the same
diameter add up to 9. Also, the [3, 6, 9] group divides the circle into three segments where the D-sum
of the numbers inside are also 3, 6, and 9.
 
What more information could Fibonacci’s D-circle be hiding? And
are there other 24-based D-circles similar to it? To find out, we look at
another famous sequence that shares the same generation methodology with
Fibonacci; that of the Lucas sequence. 

iii-             Lucas Sequence
 
Lucas sequence is another set of numbers that are observed in
nature but not as often as Fibonacci’s. It has been given its name after the
French mathematician François Édouard Anatole Lucas (1842–1891), who
is the one that gave Fibonacci numbers their name also. Generating Lucas
numbers is very similar to Fibonacci’s, except that we start with numbers
[2, 1] (instead of [1,1]), with each subsequent number being the sum of the
two previous ones: [2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, 322, 521, ...].
And similar to Fibonacci’s, Lucas numbers can be exactly calculated from
simple combinations of the golden section Φ  and its powers, as shown in
the table below.

Table 7: Generating Lucas numbers from the powers of the golden section.
 
Lucas numbers are related to many mathematical problems and can
be found in the phyllotaxis of some plants but are rare compared to
Fibonacci. So, for example, instead of counting 5 clockwise and 8
counterclockwise spirals, we would count 4 and 7, as is the case in the leaf
distribution of the Greenovia Aurea, for example.
In the D-space, Lucas numbers exhibit another 24-fold repetition
cycle with similar geo-numeric symmetries to those of Fibonacci’s: [2, 1, 3,
4, 7, 2, 9, 2, 2, 4, 6, 1, 7, 8, 6, 5, 2, 7, 9, 7, 7, 5, 3, 8].
Interestingly enough, if we superimposed the two D-circles of
Fibonacci and Lucas such that numbers 3, 6, and 9 are matched on both

circles, and then took the D-sum of the superimposed numbers, we generate
a reverted (rotated by 180°) Fibonacci circle. (A rotation by 180° is
synonymous with plotting the numbers in a counterclockwise fashion
instead of clockwise.)

Figure 26: The 24-base circle of the Lucas sequence. Similar to Fibonacci’s, every two numbers on
the same diameter add up to 9. Also, the [3, 6, 9] group divides the circle into three segments where
the D-sum of the numbers inside are 3, 6, and 9.
 
More interestingly, if we superimposed the two circles after a 180°
rotation of one of them in respect to the other (such that the 3, 6 numbers in
one of them are reversed compared to the other) and then took the D-sum,
the resulting circle will consist of the numbers [3, 6, 9] only, as shown
below.
Figure 27: Superimposing Fibonacci’s D-circle on top of 180° rotated Luas one generates an all [3, 6,
9] circle.

The above D-circle is interesting as it consists of the sequence [3, 3,
6, 9, 6, 6, 3, 9] repeated three times, as shown below. Moreover, this
sequence follows the same by-sum logic used in the other two sequences of
Fibonacci and Lucas, but with the initial digits being [3, 3]: 3+3 = 6, 3+6 =
9, 6+9 = 6, and so on.
Figure 28: The triple identical 8-based sub-circles of the 3-6-9 D-circle. Each sub-circle can be
thought of as one full octave.
 
Each one of the 8-based smaller circles has the interesting property
of generating the same ratios between its numbers, but in a different order,
whether we move clockwise or counterclockwise. Moreover, all these ratios
happened to add up to 10, exactly: 3+1+(1/2)+(2/3)+(3/2)+1+2+(1/3) = 10,
which is the Decad; Pythagoras’s holiest number of the Tetractys.
 
Figure 29: Looking at one sub-circle of the 3-6-9 D-circle, the mutual ratios of the numbers all add
up to 10. They can be used to create the ratios of the musical octave.

As we saw earlier when we talked about the doubling process of
numbers, the [3, 6, 9] group is unique when compared to the other two
groups of [1, 4, 7] and [2, 5, 8]. And a circle made up completely of these
numbers hints at an interesting dynamic happening between the two
sequences of Fibonacci and Lucas. This we further investigate in the next
section.

iv-              The Magical Quartet
 
As have shown above, the Fibonacci and Lucas D-circles were
generated using the same by-sum logic, differing only by their initial two
digits. But how many other D-circles can we generate using this same
logic?
It turned out that whatever two initial numbers we use, we will
always get sequences having 24-fold repeated cycles in the digital root
space. For example, starting with numbers 3 and 1 (let us call them the
seeds), we also generate 24 repeated numbers, which, when plotted on a
circle, exhibit a diagonal 9-symmetry and double [3, 6, 9] segmentation as
shown below. This sequence of numbers is referred to as Pibonacci, and so
we will call its circle the Pibonacci D-circle.
It tuned out that when starting with any two adjacent numbers on
the D-circles of either Fibonacci, Lucas, or Pibonacci, and then use them as
the seed of a new sequence, the new sequence will generate the same exact
D-circle from which the seeds were taken from, taking into account that we
are summing in the right direction. For example, starting with numbers [7,
2] on Lucas’ D-circle, moving clockwise, the next number will be 7+2 = 9,
then D(9+2) = 2, then 2, 4, .., until the same original Lucas D-circle is
generated back again. In other words, these circles have the seeds of their
own generation.
 

Figure 30: The Pibonacci D-circle, generated from a seed of [3, 1], using the same logic of Fibonacci
and Lucas’ sequences.

But how many of these 24-based D-circles are there? It is not that hard to find out. What we need to
do is to write down a table with all the possible combinations for the first two numbers (the seeds),
as shown below. Next, we exclude all the pairs that are found in the D-circles of Fibonacci, Lucas,
and Pibonacci, as these pairs will generate the same D-circles back again. These numbers are
indicated by the white, dark gray, and gray cells, respectively. Doing so, we find that all the
remaining pairs (darker cells) belong to one sequence only, that of the 3-6-9 D-circle.
So, in total, we have four circles that are generated using the same mechanism, all of which
repeat in a 24-fold cycle. We will call these four circles the Magical Quartet.

Table 8: The Table of all possible seeds to be used in the by-sum Fibonacci Sequence logic.
 
What is interesting about these circles is that all four of them can be generated from each
other by superimposing one on top of the other and adding the overlapped numbers, as shown in
the table below.

Table 9: The different combinations of the magical quartet and the additions outcomes. (Inv. Stand for inverted circle; 180° rotation.)

As it is obvious from the same table, all these D-circles are
connected to each other via the 3-6-9 one, which has the ability to transform
one circle into the other, as shown below.
 
Figure 31: The transformation of the magical quartet. Adding one magical D-circle to another
generates a third. The [3, 6, 9] D-circle has the ability to transform the other three D-circles into each
other.
 
Moreover, adding the three D-circles together (Fibonacci + Lucas +
Pibonacci) generates an inverted 3-6-9 circle, and when all four of them are
added together, an all-9 D-circle is generated, as shown below. Therefore,
they all complete each other.
Figure 32: Adding the magical quartet members together generates an all-nines D-circle. While
adding them together, without the [3, 6, 9] D-circle, generates an inverted [3, 6, 9] D-circle.

We can create a numeric hierarchy from the three D-circles of
Fibonacci, Lucas, and Pibonacci, as shown below. Notice how the numbers
in the radial direction are ordered such that each branch is made entirely
from the members of one group of the triplet [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], and [3, 6,
9].
 
Figure 33: Nesting the three D-circles of Fibonacci, Lucas, and Pibonacci inside each other generates
a hierarchy where diagonal numbers follow the triplet of [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], and [3, 6, 9], either
collectively or individually, e.g. [3, 3, 3].
 
Thus, the magical quartet D-circles are not only perfect individually
but also collectively. Together, they create a complete space of 24-ness that
cannot be achieved outside the digital root. The 3-6-9 D-circle works as an
intermediator between the other three, able to transmute one circle into the
other, like a philosopher stone or a philosopher circle for that matter.
Understanding the numeric composition of these D-circles and their
entanglements will definitely improve our understanding of the numbers
behind them. These numbers are unique not only for their digital root
sequencing or their natural occurrences but also for their generation logic.
Most of the number sequences are purely mathematical in the sense
that they can be represented by mathematical formulas that depend on a
certain variable, x; by substituting any number for x, a new number is
automatically generated. For example, pentagonal numbers can be

calculated from the mathematical formula of Px= 0.5×(3×x -1) where x = 0,
1, 2, ... ∞.

However, Fibonacci, Lucas, Pibonacci, and even 3-6-9 sequences are not
that perfectly mathematical. Behind their simple logic lies a fundamental
difference that sets them apart from those perfectly systematical numbers.
To illustrate why it is the case, we need to scrutinize their generation logic,
step by step.
Mathematically, these sequences can be generated using the simple
expression: Un+1 = Un + Un-1, where each new number is generated by
summing the previous two. The difference between these numbers and the
other ones, e.g., pentagonal numbers, lies exactly in this specific step; the
need to know the present number (Un) and the previous one (Un-1) to
produce the next (Un+1). Hence their generating mechanism depends on the
past and present in order to produce the future. Pentagonal numbers, for
example, do not need to know their present nor history in order for them to
exist.
However, knowing the history requires a feedback loop and a
memory, a consciousness. It is our consciousness that allows us to look at
the previous two numbers to be able to generate the third. They are
consciousness-requiring numbers.
Figure 34: Generating any number of the magical quartet requires knowing the history and present to
create the future.
Beyond these conscious numbers lies the realm of chaos, where numbers
exist without any perceived pattern or known mathematical formalism. And
so, between these two extremes of numbers: the completely systematic and
mathematical, and the completely random and chaotic, lies the
consciousness numbers of the magical quartet, the most D-space
symmetrical ones, the numbers of life.
“The main purpose of science is simplicity, and as we understand more things, everything is
becoming simpler.”

-Edward Teller

Chapter 4: The Wave Dynamic of Numbers
 
“It is seen that both matter and radiation possess a
remarkable duality of character, as they sometimes exhibit the
properties of waves, at other times those of particles. Now, it is
obvious that a thing cannot be a form of wave motion and
composed of particles at the same time – the two concepts are too
different.”  
            -Werner Heisenberg
 
iv-              All is Wave: Even Numbers!
Waves are one of the most studied natural phenomena, being
relevant to most scientific fields. This is due to their ubiquitous presence
everywhere in the universe, from the macrocosmic to the microcosmic
levels.
The most common forms of waves are those observed in water,
mostly due to the mechanical forces that winds exert on water surfaces like
seas, lakes, ponds, etc. Or, simply drop a stone into still water, and circular
waves will be generated, expanding outwardly from the center (where the
stone was dropped). Sound is also described as propagating wave-forms
that travel by compression and expansion of air molecules.
Waves emanating from two or more sources interfere with each
other creating a unique pattern of alternating regions resulting from the
constructive and destructive interference between the troughs (highest
points) and crests (lowest points) of the waves. When troughs meet troughs
(or crests meet crests), they add up constructively, while when a trough and
crest meet, they add up destructively, canceling each other out.
Interference patterns are the hallmark of wave phenomenon and
one of the essential tools used by scientists to measure the interfered waves'
properties, such as their frequencies, their speeds, and their distances,
among many other properties. In fact, the interference pattern is one main
proof of the phenomenon's wave-like nature, such as light, as demonstrated
by Young’s famous double-slit experiment, where the interference of two
point-like sources of light creates alternating regions of light (constructive
interference) and dark (destructive interference).
At the beginning of the 20th century, it became evident that the
centuries-old classical models used to explain physical phenomena are
inadequate in explaining the new observations and discoveries the
experimental physicists were making.

A breakthrough came in 1913 when Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist,
suggested a novel way to look at the orbits of the electron around the proton
in the hydrogen atom; instead of a continuum of possible energy states, only
discrete or quantized ones are allowed. The success of his model in
predicting the atomic spectrum of the hydrogen atom ushered in the age of
quantum mechanics.
 
 
Figure 35: A sketch by Thomas Young illustrating light diffraction-interference pattern.
 
Another breakthrough came from the French physicist Louis De
Broglie who suggested that particles may behave like waves inside the
atoms, exhibiting wavelengths and frequencies, just like sound and light do.
This strange hypothesis explained many observations and opened the door
into an exciting new reality; however, not an easy one to comprehend nor to
visualize. The wave-particle duality was confirmed in 1927 when a
different type of Young’s double-slit experiment was performed, the
Davisson-Germer experiment, where interference diffraction patterns were
observed from a stream of electron particles instead of light. And
previously, in 1905, Albert Einstein already suggested in his photo-electric
paper that light is made of discrete wave packets of energy called photons.
Thus, light also behaves either as a wave or as a point-like entity, depending
on the experiment performed and its observation method. Consequently, the
term wave/particle duality was coined to describe this mysterious
phenomenon. 
But where does this duality come from? And how deep does its
ramification reach? We definitely can’t feel it large macrocosmic levels. We
need to probe to the tiniest levels to detect its origin, tinier than the
fundamental particles themselves. There are many levels below that of the

elementary particles. For example, protons and neutrons are believed to be
made of even smaller entities called quarks, three of them in each.

And in String Theory, everything, including quarks, is supposed to
be made of tiny vibrating strings, which is the most fundamental level
physicist reached in their theories.
But there is still one level, more fundamental than the tiniest strings; that of
numbers themselves, the numbers that construct the physical and
mathematical constants which govern space and natural forces, such as π, e,
the fine structure constant, etc. It is the simplest and most abstract level one
can think of; the initial frontier.
 
The Particle Aspect of Numbers
The earliest recorded mention of the aspect of atoms goes way back
to the 5th century BC, where the Greek philosopher Leucippus believed
matter to be continuously devisable until one reaches a point where it
cannot be divided anymore, which is the size of atoms. By the beginning of
the 20th century, atoms were found to be made of even smaller entities,
called elementary particles, mainly the electron, the proton, and the neutron.
Consequently, the field of quantum mechanics emerged, forcing physicists
and mathematicians to develop novel mathematical frameworks and tools to
enable them to describe these particles and their interactions.
In order to describe the quantum states of subatomic particles and
to model their interactions, physicists assigned them specific numbers
called Quantum Numbers. These numbers are conserved and dictate how
the particles behave and whether a certain reaction is allowed or not. For
example, in the beta decay, where a neutron decays into a proton, an
electron, and an antineutrino, the quantum charge number should be
conserved before and after the interaction: 
 . As the
proton is considered positive, the electron negative and the antineutrino
carries no charge (just like the neutron), the equation transforms into the
following digital identity: 0 = 1 – 1 + 0.
There are many other qualities assigned to particles, such as
angular momentum, energy states, spin, etc. Most of them are described by
sets of integers, either discrete, e.g., [-1, 0, 1] (as in the charge number, we
just saw) or continuous, as in principle quantum numbers [1, 2, 3, ...].
But we are not constrained to use these specific numbers only. We
can use different sets of numbers, such as from 1 to 9, to describe the

elementary particles and their behaviors. However, this requires the
implementation of digital root math.

For example, if we assign to particles the numbers shown in the
table below, we find that these numbers also satisfy the beta decay and any
other elementary reaction.
 
PARTICLE
ANTIPARTICLE
 
Table 10: Assigning numbers from 1 to 8 for the subatomic particles and antiparticles. Number 9 will
take the place of photons or energy.
 
The original idea behind this table came from the Vedic Square
table's shapes, explained earlier in chapter 2, where we showed how those
shapes corresponding to numbers adding to 9 were mirror images of each
other. Number 9 will occupy the position of a photon or, in broader terms,
energy, as photons are believed to be their own mirror images, just like the
shape formed by number 9 on the Vedic Square corresponded to a square
(or a dot), which is its own mirror image. Similarly, each particle is
believed to have its own mirror image, like the electron and positron,
proton, and antiproton, etc.  Moreover, when a particle and its antiparticle
are combined, they create a burst of pure energy (number 9), just like 1+ 8,
2+7, 3+6, and 4+5 do.
We can check the above table by looking at some fundamental
reactions of the subatomic world: the β – decay, the β + decay, and the
electron capture K-capture, and see whether the above numbers satisfy
these reactions or not.
As explained above, the β – decay is the spontaneous decay of the
neutron into the three subatomic particles: the proton, the electron, and the
antineutrino, which is responsible for the radioactive behavior of some
elements. It goes as follows:                
n0 → p+ + e- +  
When we substitute the numbers of the above table into this
equation, keeping the digital root in mind, we get the following consistent
result: D(1) →  D(2 + 3 +  5)  =  D(10)  = 1. Now we try the β + decay,
which is the energy-induced decay of the proton and goes as follows:           

energy + p+ →  n0  +  e+  +  

 
D-spacing gives: D(9 + 2) = 2 →  D(1 + 6 +  4)  =  D(11)  = 2.
Again, working perfectly. In the (K-capture) process, a proton will absorb
an electron and trun into a neutron, as follows: 
energy + p+ +  e- →  n0  +  
And again: D(9 + 2 + 3) = 5 →  D(1 + 4) = 5.
So, all the numbers worked out perfectly in this D-space version of
the atomic world.
This particualr D-space number assignment is chosen such that
each particle, when added to its antiparticle, results in number 9, which the
zero of the digital root math, as we showed earlier. This coincides with the
usual assignment of quantum numbers, where adding 1 and -1 results in 0.
However, number 9 is not 0 or nothingness, and this is where the two
systems differ, as when a particle and antiparticle unite, they annihilate each
other in a burst of pure energy, and this is what number 9 is telling us here:
that the unification results in energy, not 0 (like numbers 1 and -1 would
have produced). Moreover, when a proton and electron unite, whether as a
dipole or an atom, they do not reduce to zero, as 1-1 will produce. In our
numeric regime, a proton and an electron will produce the number 5,
indicating unity and marriage, as in male (3) and female (2). Thus, the D-
space number assignment is more accurate, more complete, and more
informative than the mainstream one. Additionally, nothingness doesn’t
exist in the D-space, only nines. And number 9 stand for energy. Therefore,
the vacuum is not empty but instead filled with energy, matching what
modern physics is suggesting about the vacuum being filled with what is
called zero-point energy.
The above perfect particles/numbers correspondence indicates that
numbers can enact the role of particles perfectly (and energy as well). They
even dictate how particles interact and behave. In a sense, it is as if from the
properties of numbers that the physical reality inherits its fundamental laws.
However, as we have explained earlier, the point-like aspect is not the only
one that particles exhibit; they have a wave-like nature that is as
fundamental as the former. This wavy aspect is described by specific
equations, such as Schrödinger’s equation, and interpreted as a probability
density spread over spacetime, communicating a physical meaning only
when its complex value is squared. 

Are numbers up to the task? Do they exhibit a wavy nature as well?

The Wave Aspect of Numbers
Natural numbers [0, 1, 2, … ∞] only increase in magnitude, which
don’t exhibit any wave-like behavior. However, when numbers from 1 to
infinity are distributed, let’s say within three columns, we find that their
digital roots expose a wavy pattern embedded underneath, as shown in the
table below.

Table 11: If divided into three columns, the digital roots of natural numbers repeat in the triplet group
of [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], and [3, 6, 9]
 
The 1st column’s of the digital root repeats in the sequence [1, 4, 7],
which resembles a wave, as shown below, and so is for the other two
columns, [2, 5, 8] and [3, 6, 9].
Figure 36: A wave-like pattern made from the repeated pattern of [1, 4, 7]. The wavelength of this
pattern is four digits long.
 
Numbers can be either integers, as we saw above, with no commas
or leftovers, or non-integers (floats), like 5.65, or 2.7182818… For the case
of floats, there are several types. There are those that are rational, having
few numbers for their remainders or where the remainders repeat
indefinitely in a specific pattern, like 1/7 = 0.142857 142857 ..., and there

are irrational numbers, being the solution of some algebraic equation, such
as the golden section Φ  whose remainder continue to infinity in a
completely random fashion. On the far extreme, we have transcendental
numbers, such as π and Euler number e, with their remainders also
infinitely random; however, unlike irrational numbers, they cannot be
expressed by any mathematical expression nor solve any known
algebraic equation. These infinitely long numbers, such as 1/7, π, e, etc. can
also be thought of as digital waves, propagating through the infinite
numeric space.
The rational value of 1/7 is of particular interest as it perfectly
captures the essence of a wave. The infinitely long pattern of its remainder
mimics a wave when plotted individually and more so collectively, as
shown below.
 
Figure 37: The wave-like pattern of the remainder of 1/7. The plot illustrates three repeated cycles of
[142857].
 
In fact, taking the inverse or reciprocal of numbers is the simplest
mathematical method to create float numbers with repeated patterns, e.g.,
1/6 = 0.16666…, or 1/137 = 0.0072992700 72992700… etc. Most of these
repeated digits form wave forms similar to the one we saw for 1/7, if not
better, as shown below for 1/273 = 0.003663 …

 
Figure 38: The remainder of 1/273 exhibits a perfect wave-like pattern. The plot illustrates two
repeated cycles.

We will thoroughly investigate the reciprocal operation later on. For now,
we can safely conclude that numbers do observe wave-like patterns. We can
even say that numbers carry certain wavelengths (or frequencies) either
individually, as in their repeating remainder, or collectively, as in their
digital roots. However, if this numeric wave-like essence is by any means
related to the one we observe everywhere in nature, then it should exhibit
some of its physical properties as well. And there is no property of waves
more fundamental than interference. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
v-                 Numbers’ Interference
 

As mentioned earlier, interference patterns emerge when two or
more waves of the same nature interfere with each other. The resulting
waveforms either increase or decrease in amplitude depending on many
factors, such as the frequencies of the two source waves, their wavelengths,
their separation, speeds, phase, etc.
When the two waves are in phase, their amplitudes add up, and they
interfere constructively. When they are out of phase, their amplitudes
subtract, interfering destructively, as shown below.
 
Figure 39: The interference of two waves having the same amplitude. Left: When in phase, the two
waves interfere constructively, resulting in a wave of larger amplitude. Right: When they are
180° out of phase, they interfere destructively, canceling each other altogether.
 
Of the most basic interference patterns is the one resulting from
two point-like sources, each producing propagating circular waves, as
shown below.
 
Figure 40: The interference of circular waves produced by two point-like sources, A and B.

The source can only generate propagating waves within a material or
medium in which it causes a disruption of some sort, such as water. The
source could be of similar nature to the wave medium or of a different one.
For example, we can generate waves on the surface of the water using stone
pebbles or using droplets of the same water. So basically, the source and the
medium of the wave phenomenon can be of the same origin, which is an
important concept to bear in mind.
We already know how to generate numeric waves from the inverse
or reciprocal operation, such as in 1/7. Thus, we can think of the 1/x
operation as if number 1 is producing a disruption into the medium defined
by the number x. And just like some materials produce better waves than
others, some numbers produce better numeric waves than other numbers.
So, for x = 7, the medium is considered very good for wave propagation,
with 1/7 = 0.142857 142857 ..., while for x = 2, the reciprocal operation
produces 0.5, which is not a wave (we can think of it as a local disturbance
that doesn’t propagate, a sort of permanent dint in the medium, for
example).
And while the repeated pattern of 1/7 is six digits long, for other
numbers, the pattern repeats in much larger cycles. For example, for prime
numbers, the cycle is most often on the order of the prime -1 (e.g., for p =
19, the remainder repeats in a cycle of 19 - 1 = 18 digits long). In this sense,
prime numbers are one perfect medium for generating numeric waves
(remember that 7 is also a prime whose cycle is 7-1 = 6).
There are some anomalies, of course, like the famous prime
constant 137, whose wavelength is eight digits long, 1/137 = 0.0 07299270
07299270… However, it produces an even better-looking waveform than
1/7, as shown below.

Figure 41: The wave pattern produced by the reciprocal of prime 137, whose remainder repeats every
8 digits. The figure illustrates two cycles.

Looking at the above figure, it is obvious that this wave is not sinusoidal.
These types of modulated waves can be thought of as carrying information,
which is somehow expected from this very important constant of nature
(but what could this information be?).
Now, what will happen if two of these numeric waves meet? Will
they also interact in a constructive or destructive manner?
One interesting property of repeating patterns emanating from the
reciprocal phenomenon is that most of them will complete each other to 9.
Take 1/7 as an example; the 142 part, when added to 857, results in 999.
And remembering what we argued earlier, using the D-space logic, that
number 9 works just like 0, this result of triple 9 makes a lot of sense when
compared to regular waves, where adding the crests and troughs of the same
sinusoidal wave results in the annihilation of both.
Another example is 137, whose remainder repeats in the sequence
of 07299270; adding 0729 to 9270 results in 9999 as well. (This is, in a
sense, similar to adding a particle to its antiparticle. Hence, the nines here
may suggest energy, not nothingness, as it is already known in physics that
energy is never lost; it only transforms from one form to the other. And
waves are nothing but energy, materialized in a waveform.)
However, not all numbers’ repeated reciprocals add up to 9.
Consider number 78, a non-prime number whose reciprocal repeats in
128205; adding 128 to 205 results in 333. Even though D(333) = 9, still,
this is not the same as the expected 999. The graph of this number
reciprocal explains why. As shown below, this wave is neither sinusoidal
nor symmetric around its half-cycle, and therefore, the crest and trough do
not cancel each other out.
Figure 42: The wave pattern produced by the reciprocal of 78, and for three cycles. Notice the wave
pattern is not sinusoidal nor symmetric. These types of waves do not add up to nines.

The above anomaly is not the case for all non-prime numbers. Take
1/76, for example, whose period repeats in an 18-digits wavelength of the
numbers [315789473684210526]. Both halves of the wave add up to nines:
315789473 + 684210526 = 999999999. Even though its graph is not that
sinusoidal, however, one half is the mirror image of the other (reflected
around the horizontal plane). Therefore, they are able to cancel each other
(complete to 9).
Figure 43: The wave pattern, produced by the reciprocal of 76 and for one cycle. Notice how one half
of the wave is but a flip of the other half.
 
So why do some numbers have reciprocals that complete to nines
and others don’t? Clearly, this has to do with the shape of the wave, as
when half the wave is a reflection to the other one, we have a completion,
while when they are not, we don’t. Maybe the question should be rephrased
as to why some numbers have mirrored wave halves while others do not?
One criterion for those anomalies is that the digital root of the
denominator D(x) (the medium) is either [3, 6, or 9]. For example, as we
saw above, number 78 was one such anomaly, and its digital root is 6.
Another anomaly is number 42, whose reciprocal repeats the sequence
238095, and 238 + 095 = 333. Also, for number 129, whose digital root is
3, the repeating pattern is 775193798449612403100 having an odd
wavelength of 21 digits. Not only are we unable to generate nines from this
sequence, but we also can’t split it into two halves. But not all numbers
whose digital roots equal to 3 have odd wavelengths. Numbers like 147 and
138, for example, have even periods that do not complete to 9. Also,
number 945 repeats in the sequence of 105820, whose digital root is 7, not
even close to 9: 105 + 820 = 925 and D(925) = 7. On the other hand, all

quasi-prime numbers >5 have reciprocal values that sum to 9 (or digital root
of 9, of course).

Thus, one way to understand the problem of having asymmetric waves is to
look at the digital root of the number generating the wave. If the digital root
is equal to [3, 6, 9], then the waveform is asymmetric. This condition, as we
remember, is satisfied only by numbers that are explicitly non-prime. For
other digital roots, if the number is not prime, there is a big chance for the
wave to be asymmetric.
As we have observed, over and over again, numbers and geometry,
especially circular geometry, coalesce in perfect harmony. With their union,
the very best of the two is brought up in a compact image that is meaningful
as well as very comprehensible. Similarly, the completion of the remainder
(or not) is best illustrated around a circle. As shown below for the case of
1/7, the numbers that add up to 9 occupy the same diameter.
 
 
Figure 44: The septenary numbers (1/7), when plotted on a circle, align such that every two numbers
occupying the same diameter add up to 9.
 
We can think of each pair of numbers on the same diameter being
180° out of phase of each other. For those non-completing reciprocals, the
pair of numbers on both sides of the same diameter will not add up to 9,
while in the case of an odd period, no two numbers occupy the same
diameter to start with.
In summary, we conclude that numbers in general form numeric
waves that interfere as regular waves do. This indicates that numbers
express the same particle/wave duality we found in the quantum field of
light and matter. And just like numbers control the particle aspect of matter,
they may control its wave aspect as well. This we investigate next, where

we delve deeper into this phenomenon, trying to fathom its consequences
and ramifications.

vi-              The Interference Matrix of Numerical Waves
 
In this chapter, we take a closer look at the interference pattern of
waves. We start with two point-like sources creating circular wavefronts, as
shown below. Please note that we are considering theoretical
mathematically-perfect sources that would create perfect circular waves that
do not change their forms with propagation.
Zooming into the pattern, we find the circular waveforms
converging on specific points, which we call nodes and numbered 0, 1, 2,
etc. According to Huygens’ Principle, each one of these nodes can be
considered a separate point-like source, producing propagating circular
waves.
 
Figure 45: Top: Interference pattern from two point-like sources. Bottom: The same interference
pattern, magnified to illustrate the fractal nature of the pattern. We can see that the morphology of the
wave patterns (both on top and on the bottom below a horizontal plane) appear to repeat every 24
cycles. This is consistent with the Fibonacci series analysis in D-Space
 
By comparing the pattern of the converging lines at each source
point, we sense those lines emanating from the 0th node are identical to
those emanating from the 6th and the 12th ones, as if the pattern is obeying a
periodicity of 6 units, depending on the level of the fractal. This could be
because the pattern is built on a doubling principle where each circle
encompasses a number of smaller circles inside it in a hierarchal doubling
fashion, starting from two circles (2, 4, 6, 8, ...) or three circles (3, 6, 12,

…). And because the number 6 is divisible by 2 and 3 simultaneously, it
stands out as the basic unit for this fractal of circles.

Recall from chapter 2; number 6 played the central number in the prime
generation formula of 6k ±1. Finding it here, occupying the central position
of the wave numeric interference pattern, emphasizes the key role this
number plays in both the particle and wave aspects of numbers.
We can also think of the wave pattern, reproduced below, as
numbering or even a measuring system, where the nodes set a scale, like a
measuring ruler. With fractals built upon fractals of nodes and circles, the
ruler’s unit can be enlarged or reduced like the units of the metric system:
millimeter, centimeter, meter, etc. This wave-ruler is one concept that will
prove to be of utmost importance later on.
Figure 46: Numeric representation for the nodes of the interference pattern, for a scale
from 0 to 12. The pattern can work as a measuring ruler with its unit based on the fractal level of the
interference nodes
 
We further investigate the above pattern by concentrating on the
range from 1 to 121, and for reasons explained shortly. As shown in the
figure below, the numbers on the central horizontal axis, from 1 to 121, are
referenced by their digital roots instead of their original full values for
better illustration of the patterns of the wave matrix. On this scale, the
central number of the grid is number 60.
Looking at the prime numbers of this range, we notice they exhibit
a kind of symmetric distribution around the center number of 60 (for k = 10
in the equation 6k±1). First, the two numbers bounding it, 59 (60-1) and
61(60+1), are both prime numbers. Going further to numbers 54 and 66, we
find another symmetry emerging with 53 and 67 being primes and 55 and
65 are not; however, they are quasi primes. Numbers 47 and 49 to the left
skip their matching pair and match up instead with the next pair of 77 and
79 (centered around 78 = 13×6), while 71 and 73, both prime, match up

with 41 and 43 (centered around 42 = 7×6), also primes. Further out, we get
the symmetry back with pairs 35 and 37 matching up with 83 and 85. 

 
Figure 47: An illustration of the wave matrix generated from two-point-like interfering sources and
for a scale between 0 and 121, along with prime and Quasi-prime symmetry, angular references, and
musical notes correspondences. On the main horizontal axis of the wave interference matrix, we find
the digital roots of numbers from 1 to 121. listed on top of them primes and Quasi-primes numbers
positioned in a symmetrical pattern around 60, as explained above. Above the level of prime
numbers, we have numbers’ angular references as a fraction of 360 ◦ and 432 ◦. So, above 60, we
have 0.6×360 ◦ = 216 ◦ , while 288 ◦ is just 0.8×360 ◦ and so on. We use the decimal fraction of
the numbers to maintain the degree references within the 360 ◦ circle. Notice how the cycle ends at
120, corresponding to 432 ◦, which is the same value for the Pythagorean tuning. The axis below the
digital root numbers is the 1/x reference of the numbers along with their degree references. So, 1/6 =
0.166… and 0.166×432 ◦ = 72 ◦, and so is the case for the rest of the numbers. The top rows are
reserved for the corresponding 12 musical notes and their degrees of reference. 
 
When we reach numbers 30 on the left and 90 on the right, we lose
our reflection symmetry for the pairs [29, 31] and [89, 91]. This is because,
at 90, we have reached the fractal limit of our 9-base system, starting with
9, then 90, then 900, etc. Therefore, the break in the symmetry here
indicates the end of one cycle and the beginning of another.
One other cycle starts/ends at number 24, where the appearance of
twin-primes on both sides of multiples of 6 ends, and the first quasi-prime
number appears, being number 25. At 114, we get another break of
symmetry, paving the way for the appearance of the first pair of quasi-
primes, [119, 121], and with the cycle finishing at 120, as in a full octave.

Of course, the above argument about numbers’ symmetry doesn’t
necessarily require wave interference to be observed; we could have simply
laid down the first 121 digits on a straight line and observed the same
pattern as well. What we are suggesting, though, is that wave interference
pattern is in itself a numeric phenomenon, where the interfered waves form
a discrete space around the source points such that specific points within
this space hold certain properties unique to themselves, as well as correlated
to other points, based on their reference numbers from the source. This
discrete (or quantized if you wish) space is determined by many parameters
and variables, including the medium in which the waves propagate.
Therefore, this wave dynamic of numbers suggests that the
interference pattern of the waves creates a disturbance in space, quantizing
it into fractals of regions that are not only described by wave physics but
also by the numeric values of the nodes (where the wavefronts converge)
and their mutual properties (primeness, quasi-primeness, etc.).
The above wave matrix extends to many physical phenomena,
including electromagnetism and sound.  Going back to above figure, the
upper part of the graph, where it says Note, illustrates the matching of the
12 musical octaves with the 12-based (2×6) fractal of the wave matrix, as if
the interference is generated by sound waves. We used the notes of the
major 5th octave with the A5 tone tuned to the Pythagorean standard pitch of
432Hz because by using this tuning value, we get a perfect correspondence
between the angular references of the notes and the internal angles of
specific polygons, as will be explained in detail in Part III, among many
other properties unique to this number.
Hence, the wave interference pattern is a unifying matrix where
numbers, as well as geometry, sound, and everything that observe the wave
phenomena, can be expressed. In return, it enables us to map the fields
around these phenomena into discrete numeric points of specific
connections and entanglements, creating a holistic matrix that brings all of
these seemingly different disciplines into unity and harmony. Number 6
plays the center role or the mirror of this matrix, where numbers on both
sides have some sort of connection or reflection to each other. Whether 6,
60 or 600, etc., everything seems to revolve around this amazing number.

vii-           The Wave Dynamic of the Fundamental Constants
 
Most of the fundamental laws of nature rest upon a set of constants
that govern their behavior and, consequently, determine the universe's
physical reality. Still, there is no well-understood theory capable of
explaining why these specific numbers became so fundamental to nature.
One famous example is the fine structure constant ( α  ≈ 137) described by
the American physicist Richard P. Feynman as ‘a magic number that comes
to us with no understanding by man. You might say the ‘hand of God’ wrote
that number, and ‘we don’t know how He pushed his pencil.’ Thus, finding
the origin and reasoning behind these constants will open the door for a
much better understanding of the physical world and will enable science to
cross boundaries never thought possible before.
In this section, we demonstrate how mathematical and physical
constants emerge as combinations of numeric amplitudes and phases
embedded within the above-explained wave dynamic of numbers and its
fractal fabric. This novel approach will enable a better understanding of the
origin and structure of these constants. Furthermore, it provides the means
to discover new ones that have not been identified yet. 
Almost all fundamental constants are irrational or transcendental,
like π or e. Consequently, each constant can be written as a principle integer
representing its particle-like aspect, an amplitude, plus a sequence of
randomly fluctuating digits representing its wave-like aspect, a phase. So, a
number like π = 3.14159… can be decomposed into an amplitude of 3 and a
phase of .14159…, as shown in the figure below.
 
Figure 48: The number π, expressed in a wave/particle fashion as the sum of an integer amplitude (3)
and a phase of 14159…
 
By the same token, the golden ratio Φ  = 1.618… emerges from
number 1 by adding a phase of 0.618… to it, which is also the value of its
inverse: 
.

The square root of 2 (
) emerges from the same number 1 by the
addition of a different phase, 0.4142… In theory, any number can be a
potential amplitude for constants; we only need to attach a proper phase to
transform it from its static form to a wave-like dynamic one.
Before we delve deeper into the wave matrix of constants, we first
need to elaborate on two important points. The first point concerns
magnitudes. We are used to considering numbers like 3.14, 0.134, 31.4, etc.,
to be very different from each other, especially number 3.14, which relates
to π, a fundamental number used to calculate many mathematical and
physical qualities, whereas the rest are not. The same thing can be said
about any other number, especially those that have unique mathematical
properties such as e, Φ , etc.
While the decimal point is important to determine the magnitude of
numbers, still, it is a relative quality. In other words, when we say that the
speed of light C = 3×108 [m/s], the 108 factor indicates how fast light is
compared to a speed of 1 [m/s], for example, or to the speed of sound, being
around 343 [m/s]. However, in this frame of units, the decimal point
changes depending on the scale while the main number will not. So, for C
again, if we were to use Km/s instead, the factor will reduce to 105 while the
amplitude integer (3) will remain the same. Similarly, we can use 3.14… for
π, or 10×.314… or 0.1×31.4…, etc.
In other words, fundamental constants are unique to the universe,
mainly for their numerical sequencing much more than for their relative
magnitudes. The decimal point only creates fractals of the same number.
Therefore, we will handle numbers with some liberty in regard to their
decimal point.
The second point concerns the numbers used to reference the
various constants of nature. In general, fundamental constants have specific
numeric references. For example, number 3.14159… is the familiar form of
π. However, 1/π = 0.3183… is a different reference to the same constant,
just like 0.31415…, 31.415…, etc., which are as valuable to us as the
original form is. Similarly, Φ  = 1.618 and 1/ Φ  = 0.618 = φ  are both
valid references to the same constant.
There are many other ways to reference constants depending on
what mathematical operation we apply to them, such as squaring, square or
cube roots, exponentials, etc. One important method is to convert the

decimal reference of the constant into an angular one that positions it
around a unitary circle.

So, for a number like φ  = 0.618…, we find its angular reference
by multiplying it by 360°: 
 This new
reference of Φ  (
is no less informative than its original value.
This angular method is crucial in discovering the quadrant-relationships
constants have with each other.
By explaining the above two points, we hope to remove any
ambiguity that might arise from our constants assignments policy, as many
of the constants we are going to encounter across the wave-matrix will
appear as one value or the other; however, all can be traced back to their
one familiar form.
Let’s start exploring the wave pattern shown below. The pattern is
made of 11 numbers, with the 12th initializing the beginning of another
cycle or fractal, a higher octave of number 1.  Thus, the pattern is centered
around number 6, which works as a geometrical mirror across which
numbers add up to 12: 1+11, 2+10, 3+9, etc. Similarly, each of the 12
integers that define the periodicity of the numerical wave works as a
potential amplitude surrounded by a couple, or more, of mathematical and
physical constants that emanate from these amplitudes, as shown on the top
part of the numerical matrix in the below figure. And as every number has
its own unique reciprocal value, the bottom part of the pattern is reserved
for the inverse of the amplitude numbers and their corresponding potential
constants. Thus for each number, there are three other entangled numbers,
in accordance with the quadrant symmetry principle we talked about earlier
in chapter 2.
Starting with number 6, the mirror, the two surrounding constants
are 
 = 0.618… (or 6.18…, as we agreed on the irrelevance of the
decimal point (think of it as if we are working with numbers from 0.1 to
0.11 centered around 0.6 instead.)
The reflection constant around 6 is Euler-Mascheroni constant γ  =
5.77… (formal value is 0.577… ), which is a constant that recurs a lot in
number theory, especially in the expansion of some functions. The inverse
aspects of these two constants are Φ  and 0.17324… which is almost
identical to 
 And as explained earlier, number pairs on both
sides of the mirror number 6 complete each other to 12, which also applies
to the constants surrounding these numbers. So φ  + γ  should equal 12
also, which is, in fact, the case: 6.18… + 5.77… = 12.

the main 11 digits and their constants’ affiliations. Next are the degree references for the main digits,
followed by their musical notes’ assignments. At the bottom of the chart are the 1/x values of the top
row along with their constants’ affiliations.
Figure 50: Numbers 60 or 600 or 0.6 etc., create the same mirroring effect number 6 does. For the
case of 60, it will also be surrounded by fractals of Φ ×10 and γ ×10, as indicated.

 
Moving to number 7, its two bounding constants are

and Gr = 6.8169…, which is a new constant (labeled Grant Constant) that is
believed to have a relationship with the dimension of time. The 1/x aspects
of these numbers are 0.13922, and 0.14669, which are new constants whose
functions have not yet been identified.
Number 5, on the other side of the mirror, is surrounded by
constants that are the complementary pairs of those surrounding 7, being 12
– 6.8169… = 5.1844… and 12 – 7.1828... = 4.8333… These two constants
represent the speed of light (in miles/sec) C and C-1, respectively. This is
because 0.5184 × 360 = 186.624 (the speed of light in miles/sec), and
4.8333 is just 1 – 0.51844… Their inverse aspects are 0.19290… and

For each main digit of the periodicity, there is a musical tone
assigned to it, illustrating the correlation between constants and music. The
whole system, therefore, is a vibrating matrix of numbers, sounds, as well
as geometry, manifesting into the physical reality via the constants and their
phases and the musical tones and their frequencies.
 
Constants Transformation And Unity
As argued above, the many mathematical and physical constants
are simple reflections or transformations of each other through some basic
mathematical operations. As we have already seen, one such operation is
related to the 12-based complementary property of the wave pattern, where
the sum of each two constants paired around number 6 is equal to 12.
Another transformation is the inverse operation, where numbers on the
upper part of the wave pattern are inverted to generate those at the bottom
part.
A third method originates from the quadrant symmetry that
constants exhibit when transformed into angular references across a unit
circle, explained in detail in chapter 2. By positioning a constant at a
specific angle around a circle, three other angular references are
automatically determined, as explained in the figure below.
 
 
Figure 51: The definition of the quadrant angular complementary relationship between a set of four
numbers.
 
For example, the angle of 261.8° corresponds to Φ 2 = 2.618. The
complementary value of this angle across the north/east axis is 98.2°. By

normalizing these values with respect to the 360° of a full circle, their sum
will equal to 1: 
 and 
.

What is interesting is that the value of 0.272 is nothing but 
.
Therefore, we have Φ 2 on the left quadrant, while on the right quadrant, it
is mainly 
. The quadrant complementary value of 261.8° across the
east/west axis is 278.2°. 
. This angular reference is related to
π through the following relation: 
.
The final angle of this quadrant set is 81.8° with 
.
Now, 
, and 
. This quadrant
set, along with its corresponding angular and constants references, is shown
in the figure below.
 
Figure 52: One quadrant set corresponding to the two constants π and Φ  and their mirror images.
 
The angular reference of 432° is very important for detecting the
various numbers/constants relationships, just like the 360° based one is.
And as we will discover later in the book, the frequency value of 432 Hz is
crucial in establishing the connection between music and geometry as well
as in bringing the musical octaves back into their natural doubling order.

Table 13: The various transformations of the most fundamental constants of nature.
 
Many of the transformations in the above table involve the golden
ratio Φ  or φ  = Φ  - 1. Even the golden angle of 137.5º can generate many
fundamental constants by the simple arithmetical transformations
encountered thus far. The golden angle is defined as the angle of an arc that
sections a circle into two parts such that their lengths satisfy the golden
ratio rule (their ratio equal to Φ ), as shown below.
 
 
Figure 53: The golden angle defines an arc such that it sections the circle into two parts, having a
ratio of Φ .

We initiate the golden angle based transformations by taking its
ratio in respect to the angular references of 360º:

These two numbers, 198 and 165, are very related as their ratio 198/165 =
1.2 = 6/5. And 198/6 = 165/5 = 33. This hints at a hexagonal/pentagonal
relationship between the various numbers of this transformation.
The hexagon and the pentagon establish one of the most
fundamental geometric relationships ever. Together they are referred to as
the HexaPentakis, which we dedicate a complete chapter in an attempt to
fathom its secrets.

(pentagon) angular references.
 

In conclusion, it would not be far-fetched to speculate that, in
reality, there is only one fundamental constant, with all the others being
simple transformations of it. These transformations rest upon the various
symmetries of the numerical wave matrix, along with the quadrant angular
references of these constants and their 1/x aspects.

One perfect candidate for this quintessential constant is the golden
ratio Φ  and its inverse φ  (as well as its angular reference 137.5º), as they
all reside at the core of the wave matrix, emanating from the central mirror
of number 6. As we have seen earlier, this is a constant that controls so
much in nature, from the geometry of the farthest galaxies to the
proportions and growth-rates of all living things, to the magical quartet,
etc.  It definitely deserves to be referred to as the primordial constant, the
first one to be generated, and the origin of all other constants.

Factorization

of an easy way to factor large prime numbers.”

i-                   The Multiplicative Inverse
 
The reciprocal of numbers, also known as the multiplicative
inverse, is one field of number theory often studied with modular math. It is
defined by the remainder it generates, which is the digits resulting from
dividing number 1, the numerator, by a number (x), the denominator. And
even though it is one of the simplest and most used operations in
mathematics, yet it may be one of the least studied and understood. 
As we have discussed earlier, when we talked about the wave
nature of numbers, the remainder varies depending on the denominator (x),
where it comes in one of these three different flavors (considering that we
are only inverting rational digits, not irrational or transcendental numbers):  
1-     Rational numbers, e.g., 
.
2-      Repeated same decimals, e.g., 
3- 
 
 
 
 
Repeated 
sequence 
of 
numbers 
(period), 
e.g., 
 
Taking the reciprocal of the first nine digits reveals some
interesting relationships between them. Looking at the table below, we see
that numbers 2 and 5 are unique in the sense that their reciprocals exhibit a
mirroring behavior, with number 2 inversed to 5 (0.5) and vice versa for
number 5 (0.2). Numbers 3 and 6 produce repeated periods of themselves,
threes and sixes, respectively (similar to doubling). The reciprocal of
number 8 produces a digital root of itself D(125) = 8, while that of number
9 brings back the period to unity (number 1).

Table 14: The multiplicative inverse of numbers from 1 to 9.

We argued earlier that those numbers whose reciprocals produce
infinite periods, such as 1/7, are basically numerical waves that exhibit
fundamental wave-like properties, as in their forms and interference. In this
chapter, we will concentrate mainly on the periods of prime and semiprime
numbers as they are sure to produce such waves.
Similar to the main three categories of numbers’ reciprocals, prime
numbers’ reciprocals also come in a variety of three flavors, depending on
the length of their period:
1-     Full period primes, being equal to the prime numbers, minus 1, as
for numbers like 7 (period of 6) and 19 (period of 18).
2-     Half period, where the period is equal to the prime number – 1,
divided by two, like numbers 31 whose period is 
.
3-   Neither full nor half, like number 137, whose period is eight digits
only (notice that 
, another prime number).
Most prime numbers produce perfect numerical waves, especially
for those having even periods (full-period), as one half of the period is
always a completer to the other half, adding up to a series of nines. This is
contrary to the reciprocal of prime numbers whose period is odd (half-
period).
The perfect way to visualize this property is through the geometry
of the circle; by distributing the individual digits of a single period around a
circle, the completion pattern becomes obvious through the relationship
between diagonal digits, as shown below for 1/19. This completion property
is not restricted to the reciprocal operation only; it is the hallmark for most
numeric sequences under the digital root operation, as we saw in Fibonacci,
Lucas, etc.

 
Figure 55: Distributing the 18-based period of the reciprocal of number 19 around a circle reveals the
complementary property of its individual digits, with every two digits sharing the same diameter
adding up to 9.

The reciprocal operation is unique as it is probably the only mathematical
operation where applying it twice to a certain number returns the same
number back again. It works like a mathematical mirror, reflecting back and
forth between the number and its inverse, ad infinitum.
Some numbers have unique relationships with their inverses. The
best example is the golden ratio Φ  = 1.618… with its reciprocal value
returning itself minus 1: 
.  Another unique
example is the square root of 10. This is because its inverse returns the
same square-rooted number, only one order of magnitude smaller. 
 and 
Due to their polar nature, numbers and their inverses form two
opposing, as well as complimentary wavefronts, like sine/cosine waves, as
shown below. These two sinusoidal waves get closer and closer to each
other until they cross at a point where the two values of x and 1/x become
identical, as in the case of 
 and its inverse (identical in their numerical
sequencing, not in their relative magnitude). The crossing point creates a
singularity node where x and 1/x flip and continue along the wave pattern
until the next node, which happens at 
 and its inverse (not shown),
where they flip again and so on, very similar to the helical form of a DNA
strand. The nodes get further apart as the ratio between the singularity
number and its inverse increases from 10 to 100 to 1000, and so on. 
 
Figure 56: Two wavefronts made by numbers and their inverses around the vicinity of number 3. The
two waves intersect at the node of 3.16227… where x and 1/x match up, except for their decimal
point.
 

For some numbers, the remainder of their reciprocal exhibit
symmetrical properties with its multiples. Let us consider the pattern of
n/31, for n ranging from 1 to

31.  Number 31 is a half-period prime, with his reciprocal repeats in a
period of 15 digits. As shown below, the first thing we notice is how the 15th
digit of each period follows a cascading pattern from 9 to 0 to 9, and so on
for a total of three complete cycles. There are also horizontal mirror
relationships in the digital root of positions: the horizontal symmetry adds
to 13 all the way to the top of the circle. Interestingly, the 14th digits repeat
in the triple groups of [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], and [3, 6, 9].
 
Figure 57: The circular analysis of the n/31 case. The last digit (15th) of the decimal period repeats in
descending order from 9, 8, 7…2, 1, 0, 9, 8…, etc. There is a mirror relationship around the
horizontal axis with numbers adding to 13 all the way to the top of the circle (only the lower six
levels are shown).
 
The above properties of the reciprocals’ periods are clear
indications that these trailing digits are not as random and trivial as
previously believed. There are so many hidden laws and relationships that
can be extracted from their sequencing, especially in regards to the nine-
completion property, which we explored in more detail in chapter 4.
Prime numbers hold a unique status in regards to this operation, not
only because they produce some of the most perfect periods,  but as we will

discover next, hidden within the periods of their products’ reciprocals lies
far more interesting and fundamental information than ever thought before.

Prime Factors in the Decimal Period
We have already talked about the semiprime factorization problem
and its paramount importance for science and technology, such as
encryption of data and personal privacy. We also showed how we could use
the 24-wheel of numbers, along with quasi-primes and the digital root math,
to speed up the factorization process. (As a reminder, quasi-primes are
numbers produced from the multiplication of a couple of primes, excluding
numbers 2 and 3.)
But how about inverting semiprime numbers; what information can
we find in their remainders? As the reciprocal of a semiprime is the product
of the reciprocals of its two prime factors, could the remainder inherit any
information about its prime factors or their reciprocals? This is a very
profound question in the sense we are comparing the two primes to two
strands of DNA, of a mother and a father, coming together to form a baby
semiprime. In the biological sense, the fetus carries information from both
parents, passed on within its DNA. Could the reciprocal of the semiprime
be carrying similar information or hints about its prime parents? Our
investigation indicates that the hints are definitely there, no less than the
prime factors themselves.
 
So, we would like to search for any trail of the parent primes within
the mantissas (the trailing digits of the reciprocal) of the child semiprimes.
The lengths of semiprimes range from 2 digits, like 10 (5×2), all the way to
any number we can think of. Their reciprocals’ periods can be even much
longer. Therefore, we start with the simple case of 12-bit semiprimes, which
translates to a 4-digits long number (two 2-digit long primes multiplied
together). We consider the simple case of A = 31×83 = 2573. As the square
root of 2573 has 2-digit order of magnitude (50.724…), therefore, we look
for a couple of numbers having a similar magnitude while satisfying the
search criterion we talked about earlier, such as the last digits criteria, the
digital root criteria, etc.  For our case, as the last digit of the semiprime is 3,
the only options for the last digits of the two factors are either [1, 3] or [7,
9]. The digital root of the semiprime is D(2573) = 8; therefore, the two
primes’ digital roots should be either [1, 8] or [2, 4].
The full reciprocal of the inverse of 2573 is shown below (which has been
captured from Wolframalpha.com). Interestingly, we were able to find the

two parent-primes hidden inside the period, as shown in the same figure,
highlighted in yellow.

Figure 58: The two prime factors of the semiprime 2,573, 31 and 83, can be found embedded within
its reciprocal decimal extension (highlighted). Image captured from www.Wolframalpha.com.
 
After succeeding in finding the prime factors (one or both) for
almost all 12-bit semiprimes, we randomly tested 4,027, 24-bit public keys
provided by the RSA official website. This translates into prime actors of 4
digits long each. The incidence of both prime factors appearing within the
semiprime’s reciprocal exceeded 95%, with 98% of the sample
demonstrating the incidence of at least one prime factor within the
semiprime reciprocal value. We also searched for the palindrome of the
prime numbers, as in these numerical waves, as well as in regular ones,
there is a reflection symmetry in both directions of the wave. The statistics
of our finds are listed in the table below.

From the table shown below, we find that the reciprocal’s decimal
extension's mean incidence is 74, for both the first and second prime
factors. It is also 74 for their respective palindromes. This is a very
interesting equilibrium of incidences that confirms the numeric symmetry
of the waveforms, which deserves more research and verification.

To test the statistical significance of the above results, we
conducted a Z-test on our sample. Our Z-value was calculated in the range
of -11.65. Therefore, the result we are seeing cannot be attributed to mere
statistical noise or randomness.
In its simple form, this method is not very reliable for factorizing
larger semiprime numbers, as calculating the semiprimes inversions’
mantissas consumes a large amount of calculation power. Nevertheless, it
could be one of the fastest and most accurate factorization methods when
combined with some mathematical tricks. One of these mathematical tricks
is explained in the next chapter.

Still, no matter how difficult this method for factorization is, the
fact that the prime factors exist within the semiprime mantissa is a
breakthrough that will definitely challenge our perspective about prime
numbers and their products as well as the whole multiplicative inverse
operation.  

The Decimal Jumping Method
For 24-bit size prime numbers, the complexity of finding the prime
factors within the reciprocal period can be considered moderate. However,
for larger keys, the complexity increases due to three main factors:
1-     The search space becomes much bigger,
2-     The prime factors increase in length as well, which means the
number of consecutive digits to be tested is larger and hence
requires greater processing power and time, and
3-     Converting the period into a string of digits for indexing and
searching is also a very time-consuming process.
 
Consequently, testing larger bit-lengths, such as 256 and 512 bits,
has proven to be a very lengthy process. For example, we were able to find
one prime factor for (96-bit) semiprime number; however, it took around 60
days to complete. But still, it was there.
One optimum solution to this problem is to be able to predict the
range for where the prime factors may be located within the mantissa and
then jump to this location without the need to string-convert the whole
decimal period, which could be hundreds of thousands or even millions of
digits long.
Unfortunately, predicting the location of the primes has proven to
be a difficult task; as for now, it seems there is no apparent order for their
whereabout within the period. Jumping within the period, however, seems
to be a much easier task to accomplish, as we were able to find a method for
consistently rotating the reciprocal period such that the number pattern
starts in a new location of the same period. We are calling this process the
Decimal Jump.
Mathematically, The decimal jump is achieved by multiplying the
reciprocal of the semiprime by the factor (2n), which is a binary expansion
to the order n. For each semiprime, there is a sequence of exponents n that
perform successful jumps to different indices within the period, while for
other exponents, the jumps lands on different decimal periods entirely.
Let us take semi-prime 5767, for example, whose prime factors are
73 and 79, and whose reciprocal repeating decimal period is 104 digits
long:
[173400381480839257846367262007976417548118605860932894052366915207213455
86960291312640887809953181897000].

By applying a binary expansion of an exponent n = 9, we get the
same period back, but starting 85 digits later, around 82% of the whole
period: 29(1/5767) =
[088780995318189700017340038148083925784636726200797641754811860586093289
40523669152072134558696029131264].
For an exponent of n = 18, we jumped over half-way through the
sequence:
[45586960291312640887809953181897000173400381480839257846367262007976417
548118605860932894052366915207213]
Up till now, the decimal jump has not been a predictable process. In
most tests, a jump can initiate the number sequence from nearly anywhere
in the period; it is just as simple to start at 80% of the way through the
period as it is at 50% or 10%, etc. However, we do believe that there must
be a way to predict the range; we just need more research to be able to
understand and connect all the numeric variables that affect the logic of the
problem.
One unexpected find of this study is observed when we plot the
sum of the frequencies of appearance of both prime numbers versus the
period length of the semiprime reciprocal. We found that the points line up
along a couple of straight lines, as shown below. Thus, there seems to be a
direct linear relationship between the period of the semiprime and the
number of times its two prime factors are showing up within the period.
This linear behavior has been observed for 24-bit, 28-bit, and 32-bit
semiprimes. Interestingly, the steeper line (grayish) belongs to the 28-bit
and 32-bit public keys, while the darker line belongs to the 24-bit public
keys only.
 
 

Figure 59: A plot for the frequency of incidence of the two prime factors, for 24-bit (dark), 28- and
36- bit (gray) semiprimes, vs. the period length of the semiprimes. Notice how the points fall along a
couple of straight lines, exhibiting a strong linear relationship that is dependent on the size of the
semiprimes.

If this observation is scalable to all bit-sizes of the semiprime, and
we have the reasons to believe it is so, it allows us to calculate the
probability of finding the prime factors within the period of any semiprime
having any bit size by calculating the slope from already known semiprimes
and their factors of a certain bit-size. This could help us also estimate the
whereabouts of the prime factors within the period, consequently leading to
very fast factorization. This observation is another strong indicator of the
presence of the prime factors within the mantissa of their product.

ii-                The Reciprocal Operation: Interpretation and Meaning
 
All the above points towards verifying our original hypothesis: that
a semiprime reciprocal carries information about its prime parents, just like
a DNA strand does. This hypothesis opens the door for a complete re-
understanding of this operation and its importance. To achieve this goal,
however, we need first to understand the meaning behind the multiplicative
inverse’s mathematical logic.
When we take the inverse of a number x, what we are really doing
is dividing unity (number 1) into x parts. We are kind of normalizing the
number, comparing its value to 1, which stands now as the utmost upper
limit. The larger the number, the smaller its inverse will be. Hence, we are
reversing the numeric logic, where the largest becomes the smallest, and
vice versa.
In the original number space, x has no upper limit to compare to,
except for infinity, which is, by definition, undefined. On the other hand,
the inverse operation creates this bounded domain, from 0 to 1, where all
numbers can exist, no matter how large or small they are. (Some may argue
that 0 itself is not defined, which renders the lower limit of this domain
undefined). This, by itself, is an amazing concept, where the whole vast
infinite space of numbers can be compressed and encapsulated within the
limits of 0 and 1, by a simple operation, where every number has its own
pair, or mirror, on the other side of the boundary. Within this bounded
space, numbers can be literally infinite (having infinite mantissas), while
outside it, where the space is unbounded, numbers are finite and well
behaved.
At the boundary, between the two domains, resides number 1, the
one and only number that belong to both domains simultaneously. It is its
own inversion, its own mirror, the gatekeeper; for any number to cross the
boundary, it needs to undergo the reciprocal process. In a sense, it is like the
boundary between the macrocosmic and microcosmic worlds, or between
the classical and quantum domains, where inside the boundary, the world is
very different from outside it; still, it is highly entangled to it.
From another mathematical perspective, the multiplicative inverse
of a number x is an operation that produces a number, when added to itself x
times, returns back to unity. For example, adding 0.125 (1/8) to itself eight
times gets us back to number 1. So, each number in the unbounded domain

has its own unique fraction of unity in the bounded domain. Both are highly
entangled, and forever bonded by the relationship:  
.

Just like the rainbow, where adding the different colors produces white
light, the number 1, and from this same number comes the different colors
through refraction, the inverse.
 
Figure 60: The reciprocal operation creates a boundary between two numeric worlds; one is
unbounded, with no upper limit, from 1 to infinity, while the other is bounded,  from 0 to 1. Both
worlds incorporate all numbers, with every number has its own mirror on the other side. Only
number 1 resides in both worlds.
 
From a physical perspective, the 1/x operation can be compared to
the double-slit experiment, where a beam of particles at the slit (e.g.,
photons, electrons, etc.) transform into propagating waves, interfering with
each other and creating the diffraction pattern we saw earlier in Chapter 4.
At the slit, each particle/number undergoes a transformation that changes its
essence from a point-like nature, such as 7, into a wave-like nature, such as
1/7 = 142857…, as shown below.
Figure 61: The 1/x operation resembles the slit experiment where particles of light or matter undergo
a wave-like transformation of their essence, just like numbers do.

When we take the reciprocal of a number, we are peering deep
inside it, dissecting it into its smallest constituents. By analyzing the
remainder, we are analyzing its spectral and history, which allows us to
deduce so much about its nature, as well as its origin.
The remainder is the trail the number leaves behind once it crosses
the boundary between the infinite and the finite, between the rational and
the irrational. And like any good trackers, analyzing the trail always leads
to the source. And in this case, all trails lead to one.

Chapter 6- Numbers Classification
 
“Numbers are the Highest Degree of Knowledge. It is Knowledge Itself.”
-Plato                            
 
The concept of categorization is an essential tool implemented in
most natural sciences. When things are put in their correct category, their
order reveals so much about their identity and origin and their function and
usefulness. For example, categorization helps scientists connect species
together; by studying their resemblances and subtle differences, they can
discern so much information about their natural habitat, diet, what lead to
this mutation in their forms or that change in behavior, etc.
And numbers are no exception. On the contrary, categorizing
numbers is a powerful tool that enables us to reveal so much about their
essence, their similarities and differences, their mutual relationships, etc.
We have already touched base on some different types of number
categorizations, such as prime and composite, odd and even, rational and
irrational, etc. We also talked about the different types of remainders the
reciprocal operation generates. In this section, we expand much more on
this specific type of categorizations because it reveals so much about the
nature of numbers and because it is intrinsically related to the other types of
categorizations.
We start by examining the main categorization of numbers, not as a
linear list, but in a circular fashion, as shown below, in what we call the
Wheel of Categorization.
The first three main types of numbers are related to their polarity,
odd or even. As you may remember, what determines a number’s polarity is
whether it is divisible by number 2, without any remainder left, or not. In
other words, whether it can be expressed as 2×m (even) or 2×m+1 (odd),
where m is some integer. However, if the number itself is infinite, as in
irrational and transcendental numbers, we can’t express it in either way;
therefore, its polarity is undetermined (similar to its digital root). For that
reason, the Wheel of Categorization is divided into three quadrants, Odd,
Even, and Undetermined.
The next main subcategory is whether a number is a Prime,
Composite, Irrational, or Transcendental. The Undetermined category
already spans the Irrational and Transcendental subcategories. As all prime

numbers are odd, with the exception of number 2, the Prime category
belongs mainly to the Odd section of the circle.

Figure 62: The Wheel of Categorization, where numbers are categorized base on their polarity,
primality, rationality, and reciprocity.
 
The closest composite numbers to being primes are semiprime and
quasi-prime. Those can only be odd also; consequently, they are right next
to prime numbers in the Composite section of the Odd category. These
numbers are known to have a low number of factors. On the other extreme,
we find very high composite numbers, being always even. Therefore, they
are positioned on the far end of the Even Composite subcategory. 
It is worth mentioning something about numbers 2 and 3.
Symbolically, these two numbers represent for first principles of polarity,
odd and even, male and female, emanating from the eternal 1. Even though
they are usually considered the first two prime numbers still, many
mathematicians do not include them in the prime category. This is because
they both have intrinsic properties that set them apart from all other primes.
Number 2 is the essence of evenness, as any number to be considered even
must be divisible by 2. However, no other prime besides 2 is ever even. As

for number 3, no other prime besides it has a digital root of 3 (and 6 and 9
as well.) And remember, when we

distributed the numbers around the 24-wheel, 2 and 3 didn’t belong to the
prime moduli. That is why our Quasi prime numbers started with the
number 5 for their factors. Thus these two numbers are an anomaly when
compared to all other prime numbers, and they definitely deserve to be
isolated in a league of their own.
The next subcategory is about the reptend property of the
reciprocals of these numbers. The reptend is a term used mainly to describe
the repeating decimal or period of prime numbers. However, in our
categorization wheel, we extended it to describe the period of all numbers.
The reptend property compares the length of the period of the
number to its size. For example, full-reptend primes are considered the
highest reptend numbers because their periods are equal to their value,
minus 1. So, for a number like 19, its period is 19-1 = 18, as we have
explained previously. And for these numbers, the period is always even.
But not all primes are full-reptend; there are half-reptend primes,
whose period is 
 and is always odd, such as number 31, whose period is
15, and there are what we call here, other-reptend, as they do not follow a
rule based on the prime size, like number 137, whose period is 8. The three
categories are shown on the wheel, with the full-reptend on the far left of
the odd category, followed by half-reptend and then other-reptend.
In contrast to prime numbers, numbers with the most divisors
(highly composite) possess the shortest periods. For example, number 60
has a period of one digit only, 1/60 = 0.01666…, while possessing the
highest number of divisors for its size. On the far extreme, binary numbers
(2n), such as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc., possess no periods at all. Likewise,
mathematical constants/irrationals/square roots, etc., possess no repeating
period either, and therefore they are non-reptend.
Another important categorization we can deduce from the
reciprocal property of numbers is related to how they behave on both sides
of the mirror; the boundary between x and 1/x. For example, some numbers
on one side of the mirror are discrete or finite, with no trailing digits, while
on the other side, they are continuous or infinite, like the reciprocals of
prime numbers. Some are finite on both sides or are infinite, etc. (Note that
we are considering any infinite trailing of digits for the remainder, not only

the period or reptend type, as infinite, e.g., 1/3 = 0.333333… is also
considered an infinite remainder.)

The table below lists the four types of numbers based on this
categorization, along with some numeric examples. (Notice that Infinite-
Finite numbers are simply the reciprocals of the Finite-Infinite ones.)

Table 17: Categorizing numbers based on the length of their decimal extensions after undergoing the
reciprocal operation.
 
Among the first nine numbers, number 7 stands out as being the
first prime to generate a reptend remainder for its reciprocal. It is the
number that corresponds to the wave-particle duality, while at the same
time defines some of the most important constants of nature, e.g., π = 22/7
and e = 19/7. Also, some binary numbers have a digital root of 7, as in
number 16, for example, or number 1024, etc. In this sense, number 7 can
intermediate between all the different categories of numbers. It is a wild
card, able to cross boundaries and to enact the role of all other numbers. No
wonder then, when number 7 was considered a divine number, the number
of marriages between the material body (4) and the eternal soul (3), just like
it is able to marry between all the above categories.  It is also the number of
cycles, especially times, with the days of the week forever locked in their
septenary cycle. It is the number of the primary colors, as well as 7 the
primary planets, the 7 heavens, the 7 earths, the 7 virtues, the 7 internal
organs, the 7 sages of Greece, the 7 Rishis of India, the 7 chakras (energy
points), etc. Even the Great Pyramid of Giza, some argue, is built upon the
geometrical representation of number 7, the heptagon. It is no wonder when

all the numeric properties of this number tally perfectly with the symbolic
meanings attributed to it over the millennia. It is the same ancient wisdom,
rediscovered.

 
 
 
Figure 63: The heptagonal-based design of the Great Pyramid of Giza.
 
Number 6 sits between the prime numbers of 5 and 7. On its left,
we find the well-behaved number 5, finite even after inversion, 1/5 = 0.2.
On to its right, we find number 7, the first number to produce the infinite
wave-like remainder, 1/7 = 0.142857… Number 6 has a reciprocal that
repeats itself to infinity but without any period or wave-like pattern (1/6 =
0.1666...) Hence, number 6 kind of belongs to both realms; it is the
boundary between the finite particle aspect (from 1 to 5, except for 3) and
the infinite wave aspect (from 7 to ∞). So, number 6 is not only the central
number for prime generation or the wave matrix fractal structure but also
for the particle/wave-like nature of all number space.
 
And with this, we conclude the first part of the book, hoping we
have enriched, more than boggled, the mind of the reader, putting it in the
right state, ready and prepared for understanding the rest of the discoveries
of this book. 

 

Part II
Geometry and Symmetry
 
“Let No Man Ignorant of Geometry Enter Here.”
-Plato
 
 
Arithmetic and geometry can be considered the oldest branches of
mathematics, if not of all science. Arithmetic concerns itself with the study
of numbers and their properties, while geometry concentrates on spatial
entities along with their qualities, such as shapes, distances, sizes,
symmetries, etc.
The word geometry is of Greek origin where it means Earth’s
Measurements. The word measurement in itself invites the concept of
numbers, such as length, width, height, etc. Therefore, one is enticed to ask
the question: which came first, numbers or geometry? This is a tricky one,
similar to that of the chicken and the egg, but on a more fundamental level
(or is it?)
At face value, one argues that forms definitely came first, existed
since the beginning of the universe. The fabric of space in itself, whether
one, two, or three dimensional, etc., is geometric in nature. And nature, in
its essence, is random and often asymmetric. Observing random shapes, like
trees, mountains, lakes, etc., doesn’t readily invite the presence of numbers.
However, when we delve deep into the minute constituents of matter, like
the elementary particles, we find them following strict rules governed by
numbers, like quantum numbers, the fine structure constant, speed of light,
π, e, to mention a few. Even the forces between these particles are defined
by numerical constants, such as the Coulomb constant q, gravitational
constant G, etc. In other words, those minute particles, for them to construct
matter, they need the concept of numbers, one way or the other.
Consequently, we may postulate that space is mainly based on geometry,
while matter and forces are based on numbers.
Still, did one come before the other?
Probably there will be no definite answer, as they seem to have
always come together. Therefore, one cannot discuss geometry without
involving numbers, one way or the other, consciously or subconsciously.

And the concept of numbers, by itself, is very abstract; it only becomes
tangible when illustrated by geometry and forms.

Moreover,  there are so many mathematical problems that can only be
solved through geometrical means, or with the geometric method offering
the most elegant solution, as we will show later on for one such
fundamental problem.
What is important to realize is that in order for us to properly
understand one or the other, we need to study them together, as an
inseparable entity, similar to what we already have done in the previous
part, like in the D-circles analysis or the prime numbers 24-wheel
distribution, etc. Only together will their true quintessence reveal itself, and
their secrets be uncovered.

Chapter 1: Geometry: Forms and Categorization
 
“Geometry will draw the soul toward truth and create the spirit of philosophy.”
          -Plato
 
i-                   Classification through Numbers
 
We initialize our entry into the field of geometry by tackling the
subject through the lens of categorization, which we did for numbers.
There, however, we did it at the end of the study instead of the beginning,
probably because numbers are a fairly abstract concept, and we had to build
up some essential knowledge before we were able to properly sort them out.
On the other hand, shapes are visual entities that entice you right away to
put them into specific classification, based on their dimensionality,
regularities, symmetries, etc. It is a subconscious reflection that requires no
real motivation nor deep thinking from the observer.
In general, categorizing geometrical shapes is mainly based on
numbers, like the number of edges, dimensionality, the sum of angles, etc.
Still, other categories are not directly based on them, as for some types of
symmetry, e.g., reflection or mirror symmetry. We will concentrate mainly
on the cases where numbers and geometry are intertwined to gather as
much information and understanding of both subjects as possible.
The simplest way to classify geometrical shapes is through their
dimensionality; 1-dimensional, a line, 2-dimensional, like triangles,
squares, circles, etc., 3-dimensional, like cubes, spheres, and so on. Two-
dimensional shapes are called polygons, while three-dimensional ones are
called polyhedral. As for those with four-dimensions, they are called
polytopes. The 2-dimensional polygons work as the basis from which all
other higher-dimensional shapes can be formed. And just like prime
numbers are considered the building blocks of all numbers, so are
polygonal shapes with prime numbers for their sides’ count, where prime
polygons like the triangle, pentagon, heptagon, etc., can generate all other
polygons as well.
Using dimensionality as a criterion is a powerful methodology as it
extends to forms and shapes that are either regular, have some sort of
symmetry (triangle, square, pentagon, cube, etc.), or non-regular, having no

apparent symmetries in their forms. However, it has one drawback; it is
unbounded, having as many values as we wish, 1-, 2-

, 3-, 4-dimensions, … up to infinite dimensions. So it is not like odd and
even, or rational and irrational, where the space of categorization is limited
to two or three. It is more like categorizing numbers by their values, 1, 2, 3,
4, …, all the way to infinity. Of course, in the case of numbers, this doesn’t
make any sense; however, for geometry, it does, probably because our
perception is limited to three dimensions only, and therefore, extending the
categories all the way to infinity is, by default, redundant and unnecessary.
 
Two Dimensional Polygons
Classifying 1-dimensional shapes is a straightforward matter, being
mostly straight lines, finite or infinite in length. So we are not going to
further investigate them here. However, by increasing the dimensionality to
two, the number of classification’ methods explodes.
The most obvious method is through the number of sides. Each
polygon is also unique by its interior angles. The interior angles of any
triangle add up to 180°, always. The four angles of the square add up to
360°, 90° each. The interior angle of the pentagon is 108°, corresponding to
an exterior angle of 72°, a number of utmost importance to geometry as we
to discover. The five exterior angles of the pentagon sum up to 360°, the
angular span of a complete circle, which is the case for the sum of the
exterior angles of all polygons.
Figure 64: The definition of the exterior and interior angle of polygons. For the pentagon, the exterior
angle is 72°, and the interior is 108°.

 
Below is a table listing the first ten regular polygons, along with the
number of their sides and their angular configuration. The regular term
refers to those polygons with matching angles and equal sides. For example,
the equilateral triangle of equal sides is the regular form of 3-sided
polygons. Similarly, the square is the regular form of 4-sided polygons.
Generally speaking, regular polygons are associated with equal sides and
angles. Notice how the sum of the interior angles of all polygons is always a
multiple of 180°.

Table 18: List of some of the angular properties of regular polygons for sides from 3 to 12.
 
As obvious from the above table, the heptagon is a bit of an
outsider whose interior angle is an infinite number instead of being finite
like all other polygons. (Could the heptagon work as a wild card for
geometry, just as it did with pure numbers?)
When the number of the sides n goes to infinity, the polygon will
converge (or diverge) into a circle. The value of the exterior angles reduces
to almost zero; however, their infinite sum remains bounded at 360°. The
interior angles, on the other hand, converge to 180°, with the sum diverging
into infinity.
Therefore, the triangle represents the first polygon, the first 2-
dimensional configuration, while the circle stands for the last one, the final
polygon, and between them, all other shapes fit in. They are the Alpha-

Omega ( Α - Ω ) of polygons (strangely, the triangle and the circle very
much resemble the forms of these two Greek letters).

Remember also that these two shapes, the circle and the triangle, are the
hallmark of the D-space, with the D-circles and their triangulation of the
numbers [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], and [3, 6, 9].
 
Figure 65: The triangle and the circle, symbolizing the beginning and the end, the finite and the
infinite, the Alpha and the Omega.
 
Another way to distinguish between the different polygons is by
how they can fillup surfaces. For example, triangles, squares, and hexagons
can fillup the whole space by themselves only, with no gaps in between, as
shown below.
 
 
Figure 66: The triangle, the square, and the hexagon can fill up surfaces by themselves.
 
Starting with the pentagon, no polygon can fill up the whole surface
by itself; it needs to be combined with others to perform the task, e.g.,
octagons with squares, etc. Nevertheless, the pentagon is unique as ten
pentagons can form one complete circle, as shown below. And as we will
discover next, the pentagon can form a closed 3-dimensional polyhedron,
and so are the triangle and the square, while the hexagon cannot.

 
Figure 67: Ten polygons can form one complete circle.
 
Three Dimensional Polyhedra and the Platonic Solids
Adding another dimension to polygons transforms them into 3-
dimensional polyhedra, where lines become surfaces, and surfaces
transform into volumes. However, while regular polygons are all made of
the same simple line added to itself n times, up to infinity, creating regular
polyhedra from polygons is a bit trickier.
First of all, we do not have one simple shape that can create all
polyhedra; we need to use different polygons, such as triangles, squares,
pentagons, etc. Secondly, the process is not as simple as adding the same
polygon to itself n times to create an n-faced polyhedron. For the
polyhedron to close on itself and observe certain symmetries, the
combination must follow certain rules and most often be made of different
types of polygons, like in the soccer ball, for example, which is made of a
combination of pentagons and hexagons.
There are few polyhedra with their faces made of the same
polygon, referred to as regular polyhedra. There are only five (convex)
regular polyhedra called Platonic Solids (in contrast to the infinite possible
regular polygons), shown below.

 
Figure 68: The five possible regular convex polyhedra that can exist, also known as the Platonic
Solids.
 
The Platonic solids got their name after the famous Greek
philosopher Plato (5th to 4th century BC), who associated these solids with
the four basic elements: earth with the cube, air with the octahedron, water
with the icosahedron, and fire with the tetrahedron. Later on, Aristotle,
another Greek philosopher, completed the set by associating the ether with
the dodecahedron. Each solid is made of one kind of polygons, whether
triangles, squares, or pentagons. The one made of four regular triangles is
called a tetrahedron. That which made of six squares is, of course, the cube.
The octahedron is made of eight triangles; the dodecahedron is made of 12
pentagons, while the icosahedron is made of 20 triangles. Below is a table
listing some of the properties of these solids.

Table 19: Properties of the five regular convex polyhedra, also known as the Platonic
Solids.

Notice the [3, 6, 9] digital root of the number of edges and angles
of vertices. Also, note the correspondence between the number of faces and
vertices for pairs of the solids, such as between the cube and the octahedron
and between the dodecahedron and the icosahedron. These paired solids are
called duals, as by connecting the centers of the faces of one shape, we
generate the other.
For example, connecting the centers of the faces of a cube
generates an octahedron and vice versa, as shown below. This is also the
case for the dodecahedron and icosahedrons; they are each other’s duals.
This is because the icosahedron has 12 vertices, and the dodecahedron has
12 faces.
Figure 69: The dual properties of the Platonic Solids, with the square being the dual of the octagon
and the dodecahedron is the dual of the icosahedron, and vice versa.
 
However, connecting the centers of the faces of a tetrahedron
generates another tetrahedron, ad infinitum. Thus the tetrahedron is its own
duel.

Figure 70: The tetrahedron: the solid that is its own dual.

The Polyhedra: An Expression of 720
Let us look at the sum of the angles of each polyhedron, just like
we did for the polygons. To do so, we sum the angles at each vertex of the
polyhedron and then multiply it with the number of vertices. For example,
at each vertex of the tetrahedron, three triangles meet with the sum of the
three angles as 60° + 60° + 60° = 180°. Thus, the total sum of the angles of
the tetrahedron is 180° × 4 (vertices) = 720°. The table below lists the
angular configuration for the platonic solids along with their sum.

Table 20: The sum of all angles of the Platonic Solids. It is always a multiple of 720.
 
Notice how all solids have their sum of angles divisible by 720°.
This 720° dependency becomes much more apparent when we use the
concept of angle deficiency, which is [360° – the sum of the angles at each
vertex]. This value measures the defect of the angles to add up to 360°.
When this value is multiplied with the number of vertices, we get 720° for
all solids, as shown below for the platonic solids, as well as for other not-
so-regular polyhedrons.

From the above table, the rhombic dodecahedron is of particular
interest as it has a couple of angle deficiencies (77.88° and 31.59°) instead
of one, as is the case for all other polyhedra. The reason becomes obvious
when we look at its shape, shown below.

Figure 71: The rhombic dodecahedron, a unique shape in terms of its double angles of deficiency. It
is also unique, where it can fill up space all by itself.

As shown, each rhombic face has two different angles: 70.53° and 109.47°,
and they do not equally meet at each vertex. Four of the smaller angle meet
at 6 vertices, while three of the larger one meet at 8 vertices. Another
unique property of the rhombic dodecahedron is that it can fill out space
only by itself, similar to the cube, which is the only Platonic solid able to do
so. ( A combination of tetrahedron and octahedrons can fill out space.)
Its dual is the cuboctahedron, shown below, as obvious from their
mirrored number of faces and vertices [14, 12]. The cuboctahedron is also a
very special polyhedron where the distance from its center to each vertex is
the same and is equal to its edges. This is why it is also referred to as vector
equilibrium. However, the cuboctahedron cannot fill space by itself; we
need to combine it with the octahedron to fill up gaps.
Figure 72: The cuboctahedron, dual to the rhombic dodecahedron. It has a unique property where the
distance from its center to the vertices is equal to its sides.
 
Looking back on Table (21), we notice the Platonic solids have the
following multiples of 720: [1, 2, 3, 5, 9], so we are missing the [4, 6, 7, 8]
multiples to complete the set to nine. We already found that the rhombic
dodecahedron has a total angular sum equal to 4320 = 6×720, and therefore,
it is the 6th multiple. The rhombic dodecahedron is the 7th, with the sum of
angles 5040/720 = 7. But which polyhedra generate the 4th, and 8th
multiples, corresponding to the sum of angles of 2880 and 5760? It turned
out that the 8th multiple is a new geometry of an interesting configuration,
shown below (hand-drawn by Robert Grant). It is based on the geometry of
the cuboctahedron, but with some of the triangular faces turned into
pentagons.

Therefore, it is made of the main three polygons of the Platonic
Solids, triangles, squares, and pentagons (which correspond, numerically, to
[3, 4, 5], being the dimensions of the first Pythagorean right triangle.) The
remaining multiple need further research to be identified, that if it exists, of
course.
Figure 73: A Gyrobi-Cupola (Johnson Solid) found using the Flower of Life and Metatron's Cube to
locate vectors. A new geometrical shape that embodies the square, triangle, and pentagon. It has a
sum of angles equal to 5760, which is 8×720.
 
But why are all 3-dimensional polyhedra constrained to 720°?
What is so special about this number? This we try to answer in the next
chapter.

ii-                Number 72: The Trinary-Binary Number
 
To understand the meaning behind the number 720, we must return
it to its roots, just like we do for real words. The root of 720 is number 72,
which is derived from the anomaly numbers 2 and 3  by raising one number
to the power of the other and then multiplying them together: 
(we explained the anomaly status of numbers 2 and 3 when we investigated
prime numbers).
It can also be calculated from number 6 only as 62 + 62 = 72. In
other words, it is the square of the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle
whose sides measure six units each. Number 6 is the central number of our
mathematical matrix, as we have discovered. No wonder when number 72,
which defines 3-dimensional geometry, be related geometrically to it. And
when we remember that number 72 defines the geometry of the pentagon,
we get another interesting link between numbers 5 and 6.
 
Figure 74: Number 72 can be defined through the geometry of an isosceles triangle whose sides equal
to 6.
 
Numbers generated from the powers of 2 and 3 are called binary
and trinary numbers, respectively. They start with 6, for powers of [1, 1],
then 12 for powers [2, 3], 36 [2, 2], 72 [3, 2], and so on. Trinary/binary
numbers are highly composite, having many factors compared to other
numbers. They are the opposite of prime numbers, as we saw at the end of
Part I. number 72 has 11 factors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36]. It
reciprocal, however, has a decimal extension made of number 8 only: 1/72
= 0.013888... This is expected, as highly composite numbers do not exhibit
a wave-like period in the decimal extensions of their reciprocals, which is
another trait they oppose prime numbers with.

Binary/trinary numbers are at the core of the Pythagorean Lambda,
a triangular distribution of numbers believed to be very important to
Pythagoras and his flowers.

One side of the triangle is made out of the powers of 2, considered to be the
female side, while the other is made out of the powers of 3, the male side,
as shown below. By dint of this context, number 72 represents the perfect
union of the male and female numeric aspects, similar to number 6.
Figure 75: The Pythagorean Lambda is a distribution of male/female numbers, with the male being
the powers of 3 (right side) while the female ones being the powers of 2 (left side).
 
The rhombic grid shown below is made from the multiples and
divisions of number 72. This amazing grid series determines all Time
numbers, the numbers that are the dimensional references of all space/time
measurements using the Imperial systems, and are fundamental to the
scaling of each celestial body within our solar system.
These include the mile diameter measurements for the Sun, Moon,
Earth, all planets, distances between orbits of each, as well as the precession
of the equinox. Each is derived as simple ratios of this magical number
where 72 years is precisely 1 degree of the Earth’s precession cycle (72 x
360° = 25,920 years). Thus, number 72 doesn’t only define 3-dimensional
geometry, it also defines time, creating a sort of space-time unification.

 
Figure 76: The grid (pattern) relationship between 2n and 3n. Number 72 is a special integer value
due to its reciprocal relationship (23)×(32) = 72. Several numbers on the grid appear in both esoteric
and Quaballistic references to the 72. Likewise, 7.22 = The Slope angle of the Great Pyramid at Giza
(51.84°). (hand-drawn by Robert Grant). The resulting grid includes all the important numbers that
correspond to measuring space and time.
 
All the above didn’t seem to go unnoticed by the ancient scientists
and engineers. For example, we find number 7.2 hidden in the square root
of the slope angle of the Great Pyramid of Giza, the most magnificent
edifice humans have ever built, 
. Also, the base length of the
square in DaVinci’s Vitruvian Man is 7.2 inches (while the top length of the
square is 7.071 inches = 1/√2), representing binary/trinary expansions of 72

at the point where the Vitruvian Man has his feet planted firmly on ‘Terra
Firma.’ (More about the Vitruvian man in Part V.)

         
 
Figure 77: Left: The slope angle of the Great Pyramid of Giza is equal to the square of the number
7.2. Right: The Vitruvian Man of Leonardo Da Vinci has its feet resting on the side of a square whose
length is 7.2 inches.
 
All of the above establishes the paramount position of number 72,
as well as all of its fractals: 7.2, 72, 720, etc. Especially so, it is the number
that represents the merger of the hexagon and pentagon as the 72° exterior
angle of a pentagon matches the sum of angles of the hexagon, being 720°,
in addition, of course, to their right triangle relationship we just saw. And as
we explained earlier, the two numbers that stand for angular and harmonic
references, 360 and 432, are both multiples of 72, with the factors being 5
and 6, respectively.
And with 72 defining all 3-dimensional geometry, this number has
the power to bring space and time, geometry and numbers, the pentagon
and the hexagon, binary and trinary, as well as angular and frequency
references, into a harmonious unity and wholeness. It is the most universal
of numbers.

Chapter 2: The HexaPentakis: The Geometry of Life
 
“Geometry is knowledge that appears to be produced by human beings,
yet whose meaning is totally independent of them.”
-Rudolf Steiner
 
i-      The Hexagon and the Pentagon: The Perfect Match
 
We have seen in the polyhedra section how some of those shapes
are duals to each other, such as the cube and the octahedron; the
dodecahedron and the icosahedron; and the cuboctahedron and the rhombic
dodecahedron. This concept of pairing, however, doesn’t have a 2-
dimensional correspondence. Nevertheless, if any two polygons deserve to
be considered dual or pair to each other, they would definitely be the
pentagon and the hexagon. This is because the number of correspondences
between these two shapes is absolutely unique and from many perspectives,
whether geometrical, numerical, mathematical, or even biological.
Geometrically speaking, a pentagon and a hexagon defined by the
same circle will have an almost exact length for their sides (1.7%
difference), as shown below to the right. This is something unique between
all polygons. Moreover, two identical circles, with the center of one lying at
the perimeter of the other, form what is called the Vesica Pisces, which is
one of the most profound and symbolic shapes in the human culture. These
same two circles define an equal-sided pentagon and hexagon combination,
as shown below, left. 
 
Figure 78: Left: The Vesica Pisces and a coupled hexagon-pentagon emerge from the same bi-
circular configuration. Right: A hexagon and a pentagon defined by the same circle have almost
identical sides.

When the hexagon and the pentagon are nested within two circles, if the
inner circle’s radius is set to the Euler number e = 2.718…, the outer
circle’s radius will almost equal to π (3.138…, about 0.1145% difference
from real π), as shown below to the right. And if we take the inner circle’s
radius to be equal to Φ , then the outer circle’s radius will equal 1.868…, a
value very close to the speed of light C, in miles per second, around 186300
miles/sec.
 
 
Figure 79: The hexagon and the pentagon are nested within two circles. Right: If the inner
circle’s radius is set to e that of the outer circle will equal π. Left: If we set the radius to Φ , then the
outer circle’s radius will equal to C = 1.868, the speed of light in miles/sec.
Getting e, π, and Φ  from the geometry of 5 and 6 should not be
surprising as these fundamental constants are very connected to each other,
numerically as well geometrically. For example, the π-root of e is 
, which is the golden angle. And we should not
forget that 5 and 6 define π and Φ  through their mutual ratio where 
.
Geometrically, π and e define the relationship between a sphere and
a cube inscribed inside it. We can prove it as follows. Let us take at a cube
whose side is x. The diameter of this cube, which is the same as the
diameter of the sphere that describes it, is equal to 
. This
leads to 
. The ratio of 
 is almost equal to the ratio of π to e

(-0.0888% difference). Hence,  
, and form this, the volumes
of both the sphere and the cube will take the following values:

 and 
. Therefore, we can say that π
governs circular and spherical geometries while e (along with π) governs
linear, cubic ones.
Figure 80: A sphere's volume is defined by the constant π. The volume of the cube it encloses,
however, is defined by both π and e.
 
As we mentioned earlier, hexagons can form a honeycomb lattice
that fills up a 2-dimensional surface completely. Pentagons can’t fill up
linear surfaces; however, ten pentagons create one complete circle, as
shown below. Thus, the hexagon is linear in its essence, while the pentagon
is circular, and together they can form an almost perfect sphere, like in the
soccer ball. So we can say that the hexagon is related to e and the pentagon
to π. No wonder when they are all connected via the relationship: e×6+π×5
= 32 (32.0176… to be precise). In fact, π and e satisfy another similar
fundamental relationship: 
 (9.001467… to be precise).
 

Figure 81: Left: Hexagonal lattice can fill up 2-dimensional surfaces with no gaps. Right: Ten
pentagons create one complete circle.

Numerically speaking, and similar to number 72, numbers 5 and 6
have an interesting connection calculated from the first binary/trinary
numbers of 2 and 3, through their product and sum: 2+3 = 5 and 2×3 = 6.
Interestingly, in the D-space their product and sum reproduce numbers 2
and 3 back again: D(6+5) = D(11) = 2, and D(6×5) = D(30) = 3. 
We can create a hexagonal configuration of 19 numbers, from 1 to
19, where the sum of the numbers in each direction equals to 38 = 2×19.
Unlike magical squares, where there are many different versions with
different numbers, sizes, and sums, this magic hexagon is a unique
configuration that cannot be repeated using different sets of numbers.
Notice how the number that occupies the central cell of this hexagonal
configuration is number 5.
Figure 82: The Magic Hexagon: made of 19 numbers where the sum of the numbers in each direction
equals 38. Notice the central position of number 5.
 
When it comes to nature and biology, the hexagon and the pentagon
define the chemical compounds of the four nucleotides of the DNA, from
which all life is created.

Figure 83: The four main nucleotides used in building the DNA helical strands of every living
creatures are made of hexagonal and pentagonal rings of the elements Nitrogen N, Oxygen O,
Carbon C, and Hydrogen H.
 
Interestingly, the three main units of the foot, the meter, and the
cubit can be derived from the pentagon/hexagon geometrical combination.
As shown below, the foot unit emerges from the intersection of the
pentagon and the hexagon, forming a right triangle.
Figure 84: The Imperial (Foot), Ancient (Royal Egyptian Cubit), and Metric (Decimal) systems of
measurement appear to be inherent ratios of the Flower of Life's many circular intersections,
requiring only minor adjustments as a viable combined system of measurement?

Notice for the small circle, where the radius  = 1 foot,  30° of arc
equals 0.5236 foot.  For the intermediate circle, where the radius  = 1 cubit,
a 30° of arc will equal 0.5236 cubits. For the larger circle, the radius is 1
meter, and 30° of arc equals 0.5236 meters. And a radius of 1.718 meters,
30° of arc will equal 1.718 (e - 1) cubits. Likewise, the cubit and the meter
are derived from both fractal scaling and via dimensionless math constants,
with 1 cubit = e -1 in foot measurement and π/6 in meter measurement,
while the meter is  
 in feet. It is the natural inward fractality at its
next inward scaling.
Therefore, these basic units of measurements are not arbitrary and
cannot be attributed to some historical consensus that relay on trivial
attributions to man’s foot size, or arm span, etc. Their measurements are the
result of very precise and deliberate research based on a higher
understanding of math, geometry, and cosmology. More importantly, they
seem to have been contrived simultaneously.
And speaking of measurements, one of Egypt's most iconic
pyramids, the Bent Pyramid, is built based on a very unique and enigmatic
blueprint that incorporates a precise pentagonal/hexagonal geometry. As
shown below, the pyramid has two levels of masonry having different tilt
angles, hence the name Bent Pyramid. The triangular face of the lower level
has the exact dimensions of a 6th of a hexagon, while the upper level has the
dimensions of a 5th of a pentagon.
    
 
Figure 85: The Bent Pyramid of Egypt is built such that the dimensions of its lower level and those of
the upper level reflect the hexagonal and pentagonal geometry precisely.
 
These very precise measurements cannot be attributed to mistakes
by its engineers, as archeologists want us to believe. It is a well-intended
and thoughtfully planned endeavor that resulted in one of the most amazing

marvels of the ancient world. But, what could they be trying to tell us from
this magnificent edifice? Probably all the above, and much more.

Their understanding of these two shapes' importance must have
been far ahead of us for them to sacrifice all the time and effort to
immortalize their measurements in stone. We are only scratching the
surface.

Chapter 3:  Geometry in the D-Space
“ ΕΥΡΗΚΑ ! num = Δ  + Δ  + Δ !”
-Carl Friedrich Gauss
 
 
In this chapter, we investigate geometrical shapes from the
numerical perspective of figurate numbers, as when dots or points are
arranged in the desired geometrical form, their numbers will correspond to
that specific shape. For example, the figurate numbers that correspond to a
triangle, called triangular numbers, start from 1 (as all figurate numbers do),
then we add two dots to a total of three, then another 3 to a total of 6, and so
on, as shown below.
Figure 86: The first four triangular figurate [1, 3, 6, 10]
 
Figurate numbers can be 2-dimensional or higher. One interesting
fact about 2-dimensional ones is they can work like prime numbers do, as
any positive number can be written as the sum of a specific sequence of
these numbers. This was proposed by the French mathematician Pierre de
Fermat (1601-1665) to be later proven by his countryman Augustin-Louis
Cauchy (1789-1857). The German Mathematician Carl Gauss was so
excited when he realized that all numbers could be written as the sum of no
more than three triangular numbers, that he wrote: “ ΕΥΡΗΚΑ ! num = Δ
+ Δ  + Δ !” in his diary ( ΕΥΡΗΚΑ  is the Greek form of Eurika).
In general, any positive number can be expressed as the sum of 3 or
fewer triangular numbers, 4 or fewer square numbers, 5 or fewer pentagonal
numbers, and so on. For example, 30 = 3+6+21 using triangular numbers or
30 = 1+4+9+16 using square numbers, etc.

Figurate numbers represent the perfect union between geometry
and numbers. And when combined with the digital root math, they
transform into finite cycles that convey so much information about these
shapes, much more than they would ever do in their original infinite format.
The figure below illustrates the D-circles formed from the digital
roots of triangular, square, and pentagonal numbers. Notice how the square
D-circle is made mainly of numbers [1, 4, 7] and number 9 while exhibiting
a reflection symmetry. The pentagonal D-circle is made of all numbers from
1 to 9 with no reflection symmetry. The triangular circle is made of [3, 6, 9]
and number 1 only and with a reflection symmetry around the bottom 1.
Interestingly, these numeric observation applies to all polygonal
numbers that belong to the same triplet group. So heptagonal numbers (7)
will also exhibit the same numeric symmetries of the square, and the
octagonal numbers (8) follow the same numeric composition of pentagonal
D-circle, etc. These properties will be very useful later on when we
investigate the correspondences these numbers have with some of the
physical aspects of nature.
 
 
Figure 87: The numeric composition and symmetries of the D-circles corresponding to the triangular,
square, and pentagonal numbers.
 
One interesting observation is that those polygons having the same
digital root for the number of their sides will generate the same exact D-
circles. For example, the 12-sided polygon will have the same exact D-
circle of the triangle, as D(12) = 3. And so is for 21-sided, 30-sided, etc.
This is very interesting, as even when these shapes are very different from
each other, having different symmetries and polarities, still, because their

sides count for the same digital root, they are treated as being the same by
this operation.

We will investigate the 3-dimensional aspect of these numbers, specifically
those corresponding to the Platonic Solids, due to their unique geometrical
and natural properties, which renders them an excellent archetype to
examine their circular and symmetrical numerical properties within the D-
space.
As you may remember from chapter 1 of this part, the Platonic
Solids are made of five polyhedral: the tetrahedron, the octahedron, the
cube, the dodecahedron, and the icosahedron. Below we conduct the digital
root analysis of each one separately.
 
The Tetrahedron: The Simplest, the Strongest, and the Softest
Made of four equilateral triangles, the tetrahedron is the simplest
shape between the Platonic Solids. However, behind its simplicity lies a
powerful configuration that resides at the core of most living and non-living
objects.
On the molecular level, many atoms combine in tetrahedral shapes,
including carbon-based molecules, which are the basic elements of living
creatures. This is because the tetrahedron provides the optimum
configuration for any four atoms to bond with the carbon atom, offering
them stability with a minimum amount of bonding energy.
 
Figure 88: A graphical representation of the first four tetrahedral numbers: 1, 4, 10, and 20.
 
Diamond and quartz elements also have a tetrahedral shape. Both
quartz and diamonds are the best natural heat conductors (no wonder fire
has been associated with this shape). In contrast, water, the most malleable
substance in nature, has its molecules also arranged in a tetrahedron shape.

So this unique shape captures the essence of the hard and the malleable,
heat and water.

In the D-space, the digital root of tetrahedral numbers reveals a 27-
fold cycle, shown below. Notice the triple [3, 6, 9] axis of this circle, as if it
tries to emphasize its 3-dimensionality.
 
Tetrahedral

Figure 89: The 27-fold D-circle of the tetrahedral numbers, exhibiting a horizontal completion
property (D-sum of 9) as well as triple 3-6-9 axis.
 
The Cube: An Unearthly Shape
Cubic numbers can be generated graphically, as shown below. They
goas as [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, ...]
Their digital roots generate a minimum of 3-fold repetition cycle,
made of the numbers: [1, 8, 9]. Not that interesting for a D-circle. However,
these numbers are not as dull as they seem, as when adding them together
or multiplying them by each other, they manage to reproduce each other
back; 1+8 = 9, 1+9 = 1, 8+9 = 8, D(8×8) = D(64) = 1, D(9×8) = D(72) = 9.  

Figure 90: Graphical representation of the first three cubic numbers: 1, 8, and 27.
 
The cube represents the earth and the three-dimensional space that
surrounds us. However, the cube is not a shape that is found abundantly in
nature; it is too symmetric for it. It can be found in the symmetrical atomic
structures of crystals but not in living things. Maybe this is why this shape
was used extensively in sacred buildings of many ancient civilizations,
symbolizing the power of man’s order over the chaotic world of nature. For
example, Herodotus, the famous Greek historian, talked about an Egyptian
shrine made of a single block of stone, measuring 40-cubits for all of its
dimensions. The heavenly Jerusalem that John of Patmos saw in his dream
has a cubical shape, with “its length, breadth, and height were equal.” And
as we to discover later on, the temple of Apollo at Delos was also a cube.
 
The Octahedron: The Phi Polyhedron
Similar to tetrahedral numbers, octahedral numbers generate a 27-
fold repetition cycle in the D-space, as shown below, along with a triple [3,
6, 9] symmetry axis. Notice how their digital root starts with [1, 6, 1, 8], as
in the golden ratio Φ  = 1.6180…
 
Octahedral
1, 6, 19, 44, 85, 146, 231, 344, 489, 670, 891,
1156, 1469, 1834, 2255, 2736, 3281,3894, 4579,
5340, 6181, 7106, 8119, 9224, 10425, 11726,
13131
D
1, 6, 1, 8, 4, 2, 6,  2, 3, 4,  9, 4, 2, 7, 5, 9, 5, 6, 7,
3, 7,  5, 1, 8, 3,  8,  9.
Table 23: The digital roots of octahedral numbers also repeat in the cycle of 27 digits.

Figure 91: The first three octahedral numbers: 1, 6, and 19.
 
Octahedral shapes are found in the lattices of many of nature’s
crystals, where they develop into many different forms, called crystal
habits. The most common habit for diamonds is octahedral in shape. So, in
addition to these two Platonic Solids (the tetrahedron and the octahedron)
sharing the same 27-fold repetition cycle and the same triple 3-6-9
segmentations, they also share the same substance; diamond. Moreover, a
lattice made of octahedrons and tetrahedrons can fill up space completely.
And if we add the 27 digits of the digital root cycle of the tetrahedron, they
add up to 135, which is the same number we get from adding up the 27
digits of the octahedron.

Figure 92: The 27-fold tetrahedral D-circle. Similar to the tetrahedral D-circle, this circle exhibit a
horizontal 9-symmetry as well as a single 3-6-9 segmentation.

They are even more interconnected than that. As if we chopped the sides of a
tetrahedron in plains that are parallel to the tetrahedron facets, slowly, slowly,
an octahedron starts to emerge. This operation is called halving. We can’t do the
same in reverse: chopping an octahedron to generate a tetrahedron. However, if
we looked at the same picture below, imagining that we are starting with an
octahedron, we can generate the tetrahedron by extending the four facets of the
octahedron that are tainted gray. When these surfaces intersect, they form a
tetrahedron. The other four surfaces generate another inverted tetrahedron. In
other words, when two inverted tetrahedrons are combined, they enclose an
octahedron in between.
 
Figure 93:  The halving process of the faces of a tetrahedron generates an octahedron. Extending the gray
faces of the octahedron generates a tetrahedron.
 
So, these two shapes are inside-out reflections or mirror images of each
other; one solid can generate the other and vice versa.
 
The Icosahedron: An Enigmatic Shape!
The icosahedron generates a 9-fold repetition cycle, as shown in the table
below.

Figure 94: The first three icosahedral numbers: 1, 12, and 48.
 
Similar to the cube, we do not observe this shape in the natural
world around us. However, powerful microscopes have revealed that the
capsid (protein shell) of the Aids virus has the shape of an icosahedron. As
a matter of fact, most deadly viruses have capsids of either icosahedral or
helical shapes. (Interestingly, Pythagoreans kept this specific shape a secret
to themselves, considering it very dangerous if misused.)
Figure 95: The 9-fold icosahedral D-circle, exhibiting [1, 4, 7] symmetries.

The Dodecahedron:
The first nine dodecahedron numbers are: [1, 20, 84, 220, 455, 816,
1330, 2024, 2925]. Surprisingly, the digital roots of the dodecahedron
numbers generate exactly the same nine basic numbers, and in the exact
ascending order: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. This hints at something
fundamental about the dodecahedron, being the 3-dimensional archetype of
the original number space. Recently, some scientists have suggested that the
universe is finite and with a dodecahedral structure. And until recent times,
the universe had always been considered being filled with ether.
(Nowadays, it is believed filled with either vacuum or dark energy or
matter.) Thus, it makes perfect sense when the dodecahedron was
associated with the ether by the ancient philosophers.
Figure 96: The first three dodecahedral numbers: 1, 20, and 84.
 
The icosahedron and the dodecahedron share the same repetition
folds and are, interestingly, each other dual, as one can nest inside the other,
as shown below.

 
Figure 97: The dodecahedron is the dual of the icosahedron.

Plotting the Solids
In this section, we plot the D-numbers of the Platonic Solids using
Excel and see what information we can gain. At first, not much was
observed from the individual plots of these shapes, as they produced
asymmetric plots that do not seem to convey much information. Therefore
we are not going to produce them here. However, looking at combinations
of these solids reveals some interesting results. We consider different
algebraic operations between the digital root numbers of these solids, such
as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The addition operation didn’t
produce anything interesting; however, the subtraction and product
operations did.
Remember that the tetrahedron and the octahedron shared the same
repetition fold of 27 digits, while the dodecahedron and the icosahedron
shared a repetition fold of 9-digits. The cube repetition fold was 3-digits
only. Therefore, it is logical to look for combinations of those polyhedra
that shared the same repetition folds.
Starting with the tetrahedron and the octahedron, I was able to get
interesting symmetrical plots only when I subtract them from each other, as
shown below.
 
Figure 98: Scatter (left) and radar (right) plots for the difference between the tetrahedral and
octahedral D-numbers.
 
For the case of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron, it was the
product operation that resulted in a symmetrical plot.

Figure 99: Scatter and radar plots for the product of the dodecahedral and icosahedral D-
numbers.
 
The tetrahedron is the twin of the octahedron through the halving
process, while the other two are each other duals through the matching of
their faces and edges. This could explain the two different algebraic
methods we had to use to generate the above symmetric plots.
The subtraction operation can be understood in the light that the
halving process requires removing (subtracting) pieces from the tetrahedron
to reveal the octahedron. For the case of the two dual shapes, the
dodecahedron and the icosahedron, notice that the condition for being duals
is that the faces of one equal the edges of the other and vice versa.
Therefore, the products of these two properties for the same polyhedron are
equal for both shapes. From the table below, we find that 12×20 = 20×12 =
240. This is not the case for the tetrahedron and the octahedron.

Table 25: Dual shapes share the product of their faces and vertices.
 
Even though the cube and the octahedron share the same product
(8×6 = 6×8 = 48), however, their digital root numbers, for some reason, do
not match in their total: 27 for the octahedron vs. 3 for the cube.

There is a mystery here, as even though these two shapes are geometric
dual to each other, numerically, they are not that compatible.
Symbolically, one of them stood for the Earth while the other for air, two
opposing elements that are hard to reconcile either. The icosahedron and the
dodecahedron, however, stood for water and the ether, and these two
substances have always considered highly connected. Could this be a
reasonable explanation? Maybe, as numbers, symbology, and science are all
intertwined on so many levels, we are only starting now to comprehend.
Nevertheless, the above patterns and agreements definitely boost
our confidence in the D-space in particular and in numbers in general.
Every digit seems to be exactly where it should, no more, no less. As they
say, numbers do not lie, and in the D-space, they do not disagree either.

Chapter 4: Semiprime Factorization: The Geometric Solutions.
 
“The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers
and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known
to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic.”
-Carl Friedrich Gauss
 
 
i-                   The Sum-Product Approach to Semiprime Factorization
 
Many public-key cryptography algorithms base their security on the
assumption that the discrete logarithm problem over carefully chosen
groups of numbers has no exact nor efficient mathematical solutions. One
such important group emerges from the product of very large prime
numbers, where finding the factors from the product is a very challenging
and resource-consuming problem.
However, mathematical challenges often have geometrical aspects
that better explain the problems, if not providing novel approaches to
solving them. Consider Pythagoras’ rule for right triangles. Mathematically,
we know that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square
of the other two sides. By involving geometry in the analysis, where the
squared sides of the triangle are visualized as areas, the problem becomes
better understood through illustration, which also generalizes it to all right
triangles. 
 
Figure 100: The geometrical aspect of Pythagoras’ rule transforms the problem from an abstract
mathematical formalism into a tangible two-dimensional Euclidean challenge.

The search for the factors of semiprime numbers (or basically any
number) is not only a mathematical necessity to satisfy the requirement of
encryption or other related fields. On the contrary, reducing numbers to
their basic units is similar to describing matter by the particles that make it.
By studying this process, we may be unlocking much more than simple
decryption techniques. In fact, we believe that factorization is probably a
process used by all the elements of nature; it could be the most basic
operation performed by electrons, atoms, as well as our own brains.
In this section, we investigate the factorization problem by the
geometrical analyses of the product and the sum of two prime factors. The
problem of finding sum-product entanglements is an important one tackled
by many mathematicians around the world. For our factorization
investigation, we concentrate on finding the relationship between the
perimeter and area of a rectangle, which has prime numbers for its
dimensions, starting from a square of equal sides. We tackle the problem
from two approaches. In the first one, we assume the product value is the
area of a square (its dimensions are the square root of the semiprime value).
We then try to find the dimensions of a rectangle that possesses the same
area as the square. In the second approach, we require that both polygons
have identical perimeter values instead of the same area values.
For each of these two cases, there are algebraic equations that
describe the relationships between the parameters, depending on what is
preserved during the transformation: the area or the perimeter. (There are
more mathematical operations in this section than in any other one, but the
math is still simple and straightforward to comprehend.)
 
Preserving the Area
In this case, the two areas of the square and rectangle are identical
and equal to the product of the two prime numbers (x, y), which we label A
= x×y. The sides of the rectangle, x and y, are the prime factors we are
searching for. For the A-square, we can find its sides (z) by taking the
square root of area A. The perimeters of the two shapes are different,
however, with the difference calculated as follows:
             
Thus, the difference depends on A as well as on one of the sides of
the rectangle, whether x or y.  The relationship is also non-linear in regards

to x.

 
Figure 101: Squaring the rectangle while keeping the area constant.
 
Preserving the Perimeter
In this case, we hold the perimeter constant for both shapes while
the two areas are drifting apart. The perimeter is calculated as 
. The difference in the areas is calculated as follows:
As we are only given A1, we can rearrange the above equation to 
.                                   
 
 
Figure 102: Squaring the rectangle while keeping the perimeter constant.

We now perform an in-depth analysis of the above two methods,
which will reveal interesting geometrical correlations that enable the
discovery of different powerful approaches to the semiprime factorization
problem.
 
Lines of Constant Sum and Constant Product
we illustrate the geometrical correlations that may exist in the
problem through examples. We choose our prime numbers to be 137 for x
and 89 for y, and we use the multiplication table as our grid (the Q-grid). In
the figure below, we plot two prime rectangles to illustrate the mirror
symmetry of the geometry around the diagonal line of the multiplication
plane ( A = x×y = y×x). The prime rectangles have areas equal to A =
137×89. This value is represented by the tips of both rectangles.
Figure 103: The geometrical representation for the case of A = 137×89 = 12193.
 
The geometrical mean of the two prime numbers is calculated as
the square root of their multiplication A. This is the length of the square 
, sharing the same area with the prime
rectangles. The dimensions Rr and Rs are the diameters of the prime
rectangle and the geometrical mean square (A-square), respectively. The P-
line is the line that joins the two tips of the prime rectangles. This line is of
significant importance to the problem. We add the average of the two prime

numbers to the geometry in the form of a new bigger square, Aa, whose
sides equal to 

 
Figure 104: Imposing the average square Aa on the geometry. The edge of Aa resides on the P-line.
 
The right angle (corner) edge of the average-square lies exactly on
the P-line, as by looking at the large right triangle whose sides are x + y, it
is geometrically proven that the mid-point of the hypotenuse will project
into the midpoints of the other two sides. This P-line is, therefore, the line
where all points share the same value of p = x + y = y0; it is the line of the
constant sum.
 
Figure 105: The P-line crossing the X and Y axis at the exact value of x+y. The dark shaded square
represents the difference between the area-square and the average-square.

Theoretically speaking, knowing y0 or x0 enables us to figure out
the two prime factors by substituting 
  into 
 which leads
to:  
, where p = x + y = y0. The discriminant of this equation
has the value of 
. The two prime factors can then be calculated
from: 
. It is only when the correct (p) is used that the square
root of the discriminant (
) will equal an exact whole number (with no
decimal extension).
The area of the small strip between the two squares, the A-square,
and the average square, is the term  
 in equation 
,
and it is equivalent to the small intersection square formed between the
prime rectangles and the average square, as shown in the above figure (the
dark-gray shaded square).
This square or strip's significance stems from being the exact area,
when added to A, will transform it into the average square Aa. Notice that
the average square always has an exact square root for its area, equal to  
. The square root of the small gray square (or strip) is also exact and
equal to 
.
The above analysis allows us to factorize semiprime numbers as
follows:
1-     Mark the point (on the product table), which corresponds to the
semiprime A. this illustration, we use A = 12,193 = 137×89.
2-     Specify the hypothetical line, parallel to the real P-line, such that it
touches the tip of the A-square.
3-     Advance the hypothetical P-line along the grid and measure the area
of the newly formed square (the hypothetical average square).
4-     Calculate the area of the new square and see if it has an exact square
root.
5-     If it does, we calculate the difference between the area of the new
square and that of the A-square and take its square root.
6-     If the square root is exact with no decimal extension, this implies
that our hypothetical P-line is now in the correct position on the
product table and its intersection with the diagonal line is the point (

, 
). Form here, we can proceed to calculate the two prime
factors of A.

 
Figure 106: Finding the prime factors of the semi-prime number A = 149×71 = 10579 using the P-
line method. By starting with a hypothetical line, we advance the line along the grid while calculating
the area of the hypothetical average square. When the areas of the average square and that of its
difference from the mean square have an exact square root, the P-line will be at the correct geometry
corresponding to the two prime factors.
 
For the above case of 10579, the area of the correct average square
is 12,100, which has an exact square root of 110. The difference between
the areas of the two squares is 12,100 – 10,579 = 1,521, a number that also
has an exact square root of 39. This means that the P-line is placed correctly
on the grid, where the right angle (corner) edge of the two prime rectangles
is situated.  
 
In addition to the constant sum P-line, there is the line of the
constant product, the A-line. This line has the equation of 
, which is
one form of a parabola curve, called a rectangular parabola, whose
asymptotes are perpendicular to each other and where the principal axis, in
this specific case, is described by the line x = y, as shown below.
Therefore, 
. The focus point of the parabola is located
at point f, a distance 
 from the origin. The eccentricity e of the
parabola is calculated as 
. Consequently, the edges of the prime
rectangles must fall at the intersection points (S) between the A-line and the
P-line, as shown in the figure below. The A-line can be drawn exactly with

its vertex (closest point to the focus f), coinciding with the right angle
(corner) edge of the A-square.

Figure 107: The constant-product line, the A-line, forms a rectangular parabola with its focus points
residing along the diagonal line a distance 
 from the origin.
 
The general equation of this parabola is 
 with a being the
semi-major axis. When projected onto the Q-grid, the parabola can be used
to factorize prime numbers. For example, a number like A = 48427
(613×79) has a digital root of 7; thus, only these combinations of digital
roots for the prime factors are considered: (1, 7), (5, 5), and (2, 8). The last
digit criterion restricts the two prime factors to possess the final digits of (1
and 7) and (3 and 9). Only these combinations, when multiplied, will result
in the number 7 as the final digit for the semiprime 48,427. The qualifying
numbers xi are then tested such that when   results in an exact yi, we know
that we have found the correct prime factors. By calculating the  ratio, we
are following the rectangular parabola line that satisfies the equation 
. This method was very successful in factorizing public keys,
especially when it was combined with the P-line method described above.

Figure 108: The intersection point of the A-line and the P-line corresponds to the right edge of the
prime rectangle (point S). Calculating the ratio of   is geometrically equivalent to following the
parabolic A-line, where A = x.y.
 
The Complimentary Roots
One of the equations we find from the above analysis, namely 
, is of particular interest. By rearranging its factors, we
create an interesting relationship between the sum, difference, and product
of the two prime numbers. By moving the difference term to the right of the
equal sign and then substituting A1 with 
, the above equation
transforms into the following form:
This is simply a right triangle equation, with the two perpendicular
sides being 
 and 
. The hypotenuse is just 
, as shown below.
Notice how the side (or height) 
 is always an irrational
number, while the other sides, 
 and 
, are always rational.
Therefore, this equation does not only define the relationship between the
sum, difference, and product; it is also the equation that defines a unique
geometrical relationship between rational and irrational numbers. Even

though we derived the above relationship for the case of prime numbers and
their multiplication, it is still not restricted to this case only; we can use
whatever two numbers for x and y as long as they are not equal.

Figure 109: The relationships between the sum, difference, and product of two prime numbers (x, y)
define a right triangle.
 
Interestingly, for the special case when one side (not the
hypotenuse) is the square root of a quasi prime number (product of two
primes, p1 and p2, both > 3), we discovered that while C-B and C+B
(where [C] is the hypotenuse, and [A, B] are the other sides) are both
irrational numbers, their product is always a whole number, as shown
below. We call these two numbers the complementary roots. These roots are
different, but they are related to each other through their decimal
extensions, being infinitely complimentary, always sum to one.
Figure 110: The right triangle of quasi prime numbers defined by the two primes numbers p1 and p2.
 
Consider the following quasi prime number 30607 = 241×127 =
p1×p2. It will yield a triangle with the following side lengths: A = (241-
127)/2 = 57, B = √30607 = 174.9485638694985..., and C = (241+127)/2 =
184, as shown below.

The complementary root values are: C-B = 9.051436130501488...
and C+B = 358.9485638694985... Notice how the decimal extension of
C+B is matching that of the square root of 30,607, and with the two
decimal extensions of C-B and C+B summing to one, precisely:
0.051436130501488... + 0.9485638694985... = 1. Multiplying the two
complementary root values together results in 3,249, a whole number that is
indeed a perfect square value, as its square root is 57 (the precise value of
side A).
One very interesting benefit of the complimentary roots is they
provide another method for factorizing semiprimes. We will not investigate
this method further as it requires some technicalities that are not in the
scope of this book. It is worth mentioning, though, that this method is
unique as it only requires the semiprime number to be known beforehand
and is successful in performing very fast factorizations.
Figure 111: The right triangle for the quasi number of 30607. The three sides are entangled through
the Pythagoras relationship as well as the complimentary roots.
 
In conclusion, transforming the abstract mathematical formalism of
the factorization problem into a geometrical one, through the product-sum
analysis, provided very powerful methods, proving once more that by
combining math and geometry, we can make new discoveries, achieve
better results, and gain a more profound understanding of the problem.
Moreover, studying the geometry of one method may lead to another that is
even more elegant, as is the case for the complimentary roots method
mentioned above, along with their right triangle entanglement, which is

going to be of fundamental importance to our understanding not only of
mathematical problems but physical ones as well.

The Polygonal Intersection Method for Prime Factorization
This method of semiprime factorization is based completely on
geometry. Its logic rests on finding the intersection points between
polygonal shapes having areas equal to the public key.
The easiest way to demonstrate this method is through an example.
We start with a public key of value A = 1891 whose two prime factors are
31 and 61. The first step is to draw a circle and a polygon, a square in this
example, having equal areas of A. Next, another polygon of the same area A
is drawn, which can be a triangle, a pentagon, a hexagon, etc., depending on
the case. For this specific case, a triangle is chosen. The two polygons are
centered around the center of the circle, as shown below.
Figure 112: The value of the public key, A = 1891, is passed on as the area of three shapes, a circle, a
square, and a triangle.
 
We rotate the triangle and the square by 30°, three times each,
creating a 12-sided polygon, as shown below. Notice how the polygons
intersect at specific points that do not touch the original circle. (This
multiple rotation is only to make the intersection points clearer. We can
definitely draw the circle from a single point of intersection.)

Figure 113: The square and the triangle rotated by an increment of 30°. They both intersect each
other at specific points that are outside the original circle.
 
Next, a new circle is drawn such that it passes through the
intersection points found in the previous step. The area of this new circle is
measured to be equal to 2116, as shown below. The difference between the
areas of the two circles is equal to D = 2116 – 1891 = 225 = 152.
Figure 114: A circle is drawn such that it passes through the intersection points of the squares and
triangles. Its area of this new circle is measured to be 2116.

As it turned out, this value of 15 is exactly the difference between
the mean (or average) of the two primes and the primes themselves, plus
and minus. So, for a mean of 
, the two primes are found from 61
= 46 + 15 and 31 = 46 – 15. This implies we need to find the average of the
two primes beforehand to calculate their values from the difference D.
However; this method has the advantage of enabling us to directly figure
out the mean value as well, being nothing but the square root of the area of
the new circle
. These two numbers, 15 and 46, together with
the square root of the public key (43.4856…) form a right triangle, with two
sides having an integer value, while the third side (
) is an irrational
number by definition, as shown below. This is the same exact triangulation
we discussed in the previous chapter.
Figure 115: The mean, the difference, and the square root of the public key form a right angle triangle
with two sides having integer numbers for their length, while the third is an irrational number.
 
Another example is for the semiprime 12193 = 89×137. For this
case, we use a square and a pentagon instead of a triangle, as shown below.
Using the pentagons and squares of area A = 12193, the two polygons
intersect at points that delineate a new circle of area 12769, which is the
square of 113. Their difference is equal to D = 576 = 242. From these two
numbers, 113 and 24, we can find both prime factors: 89 = 113 – 24 and
137 = 113 + 24. For a semiprime of 75349 = 151×499, the squares and
triangles intersect at points that delineate a circle of area A = 105625, whose
square root is 325 = mean(151, 499). For a public key of 323 = 19 ×17, the
mean circle is not found by the intersection points of a square and triangle.

However, by using a pentagon, the intersection points land precisely at the
correct value.

Figure 116: The case of A = 12193. By using squares and pentagons, the intersection points delineate
a circle whose area is 12769 = 1132, which is also the mean of the two primes 89 and 137. The
difference between the areas of the two circles is 576 = 242, which is the square of the difference
between the two primes and their mean: 89 = 113 – 24 and 137 = 113 + 24.
 
Sometimes, the difference between the semiprime circle and the
mean circle is large, and the two polygons do not intersect at the correct
position. This can be adjusted by  multiplying the intersection circle by the
factor of 
. This factor expands the intersection circle into the correct
position of the mean circle, allowing us to calculate the values of the prime
factors correctly.
The origin of the 
 factor is still not quite understood.
Nevertheless, it helps to consider that when we take the ratio of the areas of
the product circle 
 and the average circle 
, the value is equal to 
. Therefore, 
. The first prime number is
2, and for the special case where p1 and p2 = 2, the results is an exact 1 for 
 and we are left with the 
 factor, which represents the maximum
limit for the ratio between the two circles. All other ratios get smaller than 
 for any combination of numbers, whether they are equal or not. (Worth
mentioning as well is the fact that the public key defines an area or an A-

line, that is ruled by a rectangular parabola whose eccentricity is 
, as we
explained earlier.)

ii-                The Flower of Life and Prime Factorization
 
The Flower of Life is a universal symbol deemed sacred by many
civilizations around the world, including Egypt, Rome, India, and China.
One engraving of this flower is found on the walls of the very ancient
Osirian Temple in Egypt. The exact date of this temple is controversial as
some researchers date it back to many thousands of years, around 10,000
BC, much older than what orthodox Egyptologists are willing to accept.
The flower itself comes in many forms; all are based on
overlapping circles, differing in their number, from 7 to 19 to 127, etc. The
most famous form consists of 19 small circles encompassed by a large one,
laid down in a hexagonal configuration, as shown below.
 
Figure 117: The Flower of Life, a mystical symbol made of 19 overlapping circles.
 
The Flower of Life is thought to embody the ferment of the original
creation process, meant to represent the evolution of life from the
rudimentary Seed of Life, made of the 7 central circles, shown below, into a
fully developed human being. In fact, the seed of life has a very close
resemblance to the shape of the first three mitotic divisions of the human
embryo. It also represents the 7 days of creation, starting from the first
circle for the first day, then two overlapping circles forming the Vesica
Piscis for the second day, and so on until 7 circles are completely drawn.

Figure 118: The Seed of Life, found at the center of the Flower of Life, made of six circles encircling
a seventh.
 
The flower is a very powerful blueprint, hiding within its
proportions many important numbers and mathematical constants such as
√2, √3, and the golden section Φ . Additionally, the central seed of life
defines a [3, 4, 5] Pythagorean triangle, shown below. This right triangle is
adopted by the designer of the second most important pyramid of the Giza
Plateau, that of Khafre. If the base of this pyramid is scaled down to 6 units,
its height reduces to 4 units. In other words, half the base, height, and slope
form a [3, 4, 5] relationship.
 
Figure 119: A [3, 4, 5] right triangle defined by The Seed of Life. The same triangle resides at the
core of the Khafre Pyramid of Giza.

It is also a perfect embodiment of sacred geometrical forms, such as
the Metatron Cube, the Vesica Piscis, the Hexapentakis, as well as the Tree
of Life of the Kabala, among many others.
Figure 120: The Tree of Life embedded within the Flower of Life blueprint, delineating a
pentagonal/hexagonal relationship.
 
In another rendition, the Flower of Life can be transformed into a
torus-like shape (Torus of Life), shown below, with 24 intersecting circles
and a 25th one at the center. What is so powerful about this shape is that it
works like a measuring ruler where the intersection points of the 24 circles
project on the horizontal line (the tangent to the central circle) units of equal
distances, based on the units used in drawing the circles. The more circles
we include in the torus, the more intersections we get and the finer the
ruler’s units become.
For example, if the central circle diameter is set to 4 units, which
could be centimeter, inch, etc., the intersection points will project equal
distances of 1 unit, 2 units, 3 units…, etc., as shown below. What is even
more interesting is that for this specific value of the diameter (4 units),
some intersections project an exact value for the Euler number and π, as
shown in the same figure.

The number e vertical line goes through an intersection point that is
2.814 units from the center. The π-line goes through an intersection point
that is 3.168 units from the center. Number 2.814 is the square root of
earth’s accepted diameter in miles, which is 7920 miles. The number 3168
is the length of the New Jerusalem, as proposed by John of Patmos, being
3168 cubits. What is more interesting is the fact that the circumference of
the Earth is circular and, through the Flower of Life, is related to π, while
the New Jerusalem is said in the Book of Revelation to be cubic in form and
is related to e. This agrees perfectly with what we have suggested earlier on
in our sphere/cube analysis, with e defining cubic forms and π defining
spherical ones.
This is another great example of the strong connection between
science and ancient symbolism and how scientific knowledge used to be
encoded within texts that do not at all pertain to such topics or themes.
Figure 121: The Torus of Life: made of 24 circles plus a central one. It works as a ruler that can
create equal distancing units as well as projecting values of mathematical constants.
 
The fact that these two fundamental constants emerge from a Torus
having circles’ diameters equal to 4 units is not surprising, as 4 and π share
a very powerful bond. For example, a circle of diameter equal to 4 units
will have an equal value for its area and perimeter, being 4π.

This is a unique circle with an area-to-perimeter ratio of 1, a kind of
boundary condition, where for values less than 4, the perimeter will exceed
the area in value, and for values larger than 4, the area will exceed the
perimeter. A square having a side of 4 units will have an equal area and
perimeter as well, being 16 = 4×4. Thus number 4 defines circular (π) and
linear (e) geometries having properties of perfect balance, no less that 1 and
no more.
Figure 122: A circle and a square sharing the same dimension of 4 units will both have an area-to-
parameter ratio equal to 1.
 
Taking the ratio of the areas (or perimeters) of these special circle
and square gives 
 which is almost equal to the square
root of the golden ratio where 
All the above suggests there is something important about number
4, especially as a measuring unit. Its ability to extract e and π from the torus
of life as well as producing equal areas and parameters for the circle and the
square is extraordinary. Add to it the fact that 
,  and we get
something that definitely deserves to pause and ponder about. And for the
Pythagoreans, number 4 was the “fountain of nature” and its key. Being the
first square number (2×2), a product of equal factors, 4 was the number of
justice. Is it a coincidence when justice is about equality, and number 4 is
where areas and perimeters become equal?
Squaring the circle was an obsession for ancient philosophers.
Finding this exact value that can transform a square into a circle has always

been an elusive endeavor due to the irrational value of the constant that
governs circularity, the π number.

 
But what if the real aim had always been to reconcile these two
shapes into something that is meaningful, not exact? Something similar to
what we have discussed above with equal area and perimeters.
And what if we squared the circles of the Flower of Life, using
overlapping squares instead of circles? The emerging pattern forms
overlapping Golden Rectangles across the flower’s structure, as shown
below. This is yet another form of the Hexpentakis geometry because
Golden Rectangles possess the same ratios derived from the square root of
the number 5 (Pentagram and Pentagon), while the whole pattern is one
large hexagon.
Figure 123: Replacing the circles of the hexagonal Flower of Life with squares creates a mesh of
overlapping golden rectangles that embodies pentagons within their proportions.
 
Thus, we went on a full circle (or a square) from the flower of life
to the torus of life to number 4 and the fundamental constants, to squaring
the circle, to Φ  and its golden rectangles, ending with the Hexapentakis
and the Flower of Life back. What else can we learn from this amazing
geometry?

The Torus of Factorization
The logic behind the polygonal intersection method for prime
factorization we discussed in the previous chapter is not well understood
yet. Luckily, the Torus of Life can shed more light on the geometric aspect
of prime numbers, as it turned out the torus can also work as a geometrical
factorization system.
From what we explained earlier, the intersections the circles are
making with each other set a scale, like a ruler, where the circles’ diameters
determine the units of that ruler. With only one starting value (any diameter
value), we can derive the precise locations of whole integer Pythagorean
right triangles and their respective side values by using the intersection
points of the Torus of Life and its higher and lower 'fractals' forms. This
allows for prime factorization methodology using only one circle whose
diameter is the square root value of the number whose prime factors we
wish to identify.
Consider the case shown below. The number we wish to find its
prime factors is S = 253 = 11×23; therefore, the height of the right triangle
(and the central circle diameter) is √253. The only right triangle that will
possess two whole number values for both the base and the hypotenuse will
have the following proportional dimensions:  side A (base) = 6, and side C
(hypotenuse) = 17 = √289.  The two prime factors are derived as follows: C
- A = x = 11; and C + A = y = 23.  The circles' intersections are signifying at
least two points that inform the precise line segment placement of the
hypotenuse and, therefore, the other two sides as well.
All of this was obtained using only one equal diameter value
(informing the length of side B) to locate the relevant circles' intersections
and identify the other two sides of the right triangle and, by extension,
identify its two prime factors (in a deterministic manner).
From similar examples as the above, we were able to deduce an
equation that can factorize semiprime numbers perfectly, especially if the
prime factors were close to each other. The equation goes as follows:
Where the minus sign is used for finding one prime factor (x) and
the plus sign is used for finding the other factor (y). The factor 
 and the round function is used to
round to the nearest half-integer. For the case where the prime numbers are

far apart, the Δ  function should be modified such that its value is not
necessary the square of the base of the triangle (A) but a multiple of it. The
correct multiplication factor can be determined by a trial and error method.

Figure 124: Using the intersection points of the Torus of Life to factorize a semiprime number. The
diameter of the circles is equal to the square root of the semiprime. Only when the base, side A, and
the hypotenuse, side B, are whole integers, that the prime factors can be found from these two values.
 
 
Being able to perform factorization from the semiprime alone via a
simple equation, and even if it is not 100% accurate for all cases, is by itself
a major breakthrough in the field of prime numbers, as well as a further step
in understanding the relationship these numbers have with geometry, which,
by now, has become clear is based on the right triangles that emerge from
the circular intersections of the Flowe/Torus of Life. A triangle so simple
and basic in its design, yet it embodies some of the most fundamental
principles that nature uses in its dynamic.
Simplicity is always the key to understanding.

ii-                The Right Triangle: The Marriage of Numbers
 
We all agree by now that the right triangle is a very fundamental
shape, especially when it comes to semiprimes and their factors. That been
said, the right factorization relationship is not reserved for prime numbers
only; any number can be expressed through this relationship, as shown in
the table below for numbers from 1 to 7. Of course, most numbers have
many factors besides the ones shown below; however, only those that are
defined by the Pythagorean rule exhibit such strong geo-numeric
entanglement between them.

Table 26: The first seven numbers and their corresponding right triangular representations.
 
One such unique triangle is shown below. Besides having its sides
equal to the square roots of the [3, 6, 9] triplet group, taking the sum and
product of its two irrational complimentary roots results in number 6, for
both. As we showed earlier, the complimentary roots of this specific
triangle can be calculated as √9+√3 = 4.73205… and √9-√3 = 1.26795…
Interestingly, 4.73205… + 1.26795… = 4.73205… × 1.26795… = 6.
Number 6 is considered a perfect number as the sum and product of its
divisors are the same and equal to the same 6: 1+2+3 = 6 and 1×2×3 = 6,
which renders this triangle a double-perfect one.
Actually, our research suggests that using these triangles to
factorize prime numbers is something each one of us is constantly doing in
our unconscious minds, where the complex factorization mathematics
needed for many vital operations, such as vision, is performed.

Figure 125: The perfect right triangle of sides equal to the square roots of the triplet group of [3, 6, 9]
has the unique property where its two complimentary roots add and multiply to the same result of 6.
 
In the vision process, for example, the eye will increase its lens
diameter by relaxing the ciliary body muscles in its anterior chamber. The
lens diameter adjustment will also be accompanied by the unconscious
modulation from a convex lens configuration (bulging lens at the center for
near vision) towards a concave lens one (at higher diameters for distance
vision).
 
 
Figure 126: The prime-factorization geometric method used by the brain to achieve optical focus in
the eye (hand-drawn by Robert Grant.)

Let us consider an observer who sets his gaze on a tree a distance r
from where he is positioned, as shown below for the solid circle. In order to
adjust natural lens diameter precisely to look on a further out object, a
distance R, the eye and unconscious
mind must solve the R diameter of the mean (area) by fiding the two prime
factors (x and y) whose √(x×y) = r, such that they make a perfect right
triangle whose side is R (or nearest exact value). This, of course, takes
some time complexity, which is approximately the same time it takes our
eyes to refocus. So, for a distance r = 43.4856…, the two prime factors that
form a perfect right triangle with a hypotenuse of 46 are 31 and 61.
 
Figure 127: The area of the solid circle (r) represents the eye’s current range of focus. The dotted
circle (R) represents the new range of focus. Both create a right triangle that is based on prime
number x, y such that r = √x.y, and R = (x+y)/2.
 
When two prime numbers (x and y) are multiplied, are they
likewise added in some other dimension? What about their difference? The
discovery that these are simple separations distributed across Pythagorean
triangular dimensions opens the doors for more interesting discoveries that
pertain to all fields of physics, from quantum mechanics to mathematics
and even biology. In fact, the relationship between the electron, the proton,
and the neutron could be the physical manifestation inherited from right
triangle principles, as well as space-time, gravity and electromagnetism,
and all other trinary relationships that we most often found in the laws that
govern nature.

Figure 128: The triangular relationships between the various aspects of the physical world.
 
Besides their fundamental numerical relationships, right triangles
can create some of the most important shapes in nature: spirals. It is already
known that placing right triangles next to each other such that one triangle's
hypotonus works as the other’s perpendicular side will produce a perfect
spiral for the special case when the outer sides of all triangles are set to 1
unit in length, as shown below.  This Spiral is called the Spiral of
Theodorus, in reference to Theodorus of Cyrene (340 – 250 BC).
 
Figure 129: The spiral of Theodorus.

Now, if we constrained the height of the right triangles to be equal
to 1, 2, 3… up to infinity, keeping the base at 1 unit, a new type of spirals
emerges, shown below. This new spiral was named the Spiral of Regulus by
Robert Grant.
Thus, right triangles could be one basic method through which
nature creates these wonderful shapes, and on all levels, from the largest
macrocosm, such as clouds and galaxies, down to the smallest microscopic
level of the DNA strand.
 
 
Figure 130: The Spiral of Regulus. All the bases are set to 1 unit. The hypotenuses range from 1, 2, 3,
up to infinity. The heights are square roots of 2, 5, 10, etc.
 
One of our prominent colleagues, the Shakespeare scholar, Alan
Green (www.ToBeOrNotToBe.org), discovered, encoded within the title
page of the 1609 publication of Shakespeare’s Sonnets, a previously
unknown connection between the primary Pythagorean triangle (sides
[3:4:5]) and the three most significant mathematical constants π, Φ  and e.
Startling in its simplicity and elegance, he found that [π/( Φ ×e)]×[(3+4)/5]
= [π/( Φ ×e)]×[(sin( θ ) + cos( θ )]  = 0.99999  ≈ 1, where θ  is the angle
between the [3:5] sides. The full significance of this equation will be much
more appreciated once we discuss the 12-base system and the three new
hidden numbers.
Thus, the simple yet potent shape of the triangle is the ultimate
encoder, a gateway through which our consciousness can stretch towards
higher understandings. The perfect spirals it makes are the universal carriers
that transcend all boundaries and limitations and through which all
information can be coded and transported, right from the smallest DNA and
up to the farthest galaxies.

Chapter 5- The Fractal Root
 
“Maybe you are searching among the branches, for what only appears in the roots.”
Al-Rumi
 
i-                   The Square Fractal Root
 
Finding the roots of numbers, such as their square roots, is one of
the most fundamental mathematical operations that have been implemented
for millennia. It is an indispensable tool for solving many important
mathematical problems, either algebraic or geometric, such as polynomial
equations, standard deviations, the Pythagoras rule for right triangles, etc. It
is also embedded within the formulas of some important physical constants,
such as Planck’s length: 
 (where  is the Planck constant, G is the
gravitational constant, and C is the speed of light).
One very familiar root is the square root of number 2, which solves
for the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose perpendicular sides measure to
unity. Using Pythagoras rule, we can calculate the hypotenuse as: 
1.41421356... The irrational nature of this number is
believed to have been confirmed by the Greek mathematician Hippasus of
Metapontum (530 - 450 BC). (This discovery sent shockwaves throughout
the Pythagoreans’ society who would not accept the existence of such
imperfect numbers (e.g., irrational, transcendental, etc.) to the extent they
are rumored to have thrown Hippasus into the sea as a punishment for his
heretical discovery.)
It is a consensus among mathematicians that any number's principal
roots must be numerically identical in both: their numbers sequencing and
relative magnitude. They can be negative or positive, but they must be
identical in all other aspects. This restricted the root of any number to one
value only, depending on the order of the root. For example, the square root
of number 4 can be number number 2 only, plus or minus.  Similarly, the
cube root of number 64 is ±4 only.
But could there be another way to square- or cube-root numbers? In
other words, is it possible to find identical roots for any number, other than
its formal roots, such that when multiplied together, they will generate the
same number back?

At 
first 
inspection, 
this 
question 
may 
seem 
ridiculous.
Nevertheless, there is the possibility of a reasonable answer, given that we
relax the constraints imposed on what we define as identical numbers. As
we explained above, the formal definition for two identical numbers is they
have the same exact numerical sequencing and relative magnitude: their
decimal points. For example, 3.14 is not considered identical to 0.314 nor to
31.4, etc. But as you may remember from Part I, the wave nature of
constants showed us that we are allowed to take a bit of a relaxed approach
to this strict definition by removing the decimal point constraint. In other
words, we consider numbers like 3.14, 0.314, and 31.4 to be fractally
identical. For example, a number like π = 3.14… can also be written as
0.314 × 10 or 31.4/10, etc. In other words, what really identifies this
number is its unique numerical structure: 3, followed by 1, then 4, and so
on; it is this specific sequencing that sets this number apart from all other
numbers, not its decimal point. Working with this fractally-identical
scheme of numbers expands our understanding of some mathematical
operations while enables the discovery of new ones. And one such
operation is the root, which we start investigating its fractal-based nature by
examining the simplest case of the square root.
The square root reduces any number (y) to a pair of identical
smaller numbers (x) such that 
. The result can be an integer
or a non-integer (a float), depending on the original number. We can also
reverse the notation to write: 
. The number x is called the principal
square root of y, which is called the radicand. The radical symbol 
indicates taking the root of the radicand y, and the superscript ‘2’ indicates
taking the square root, not the cube or fourth roots, etc. The radical symbol
may have its origin from the Arabic letter ‘ج’, phonetically equivalent to G
or J, which is the first letter in the word ‘Jathr’, meaning root, which had
been used by Arab mathematicians as a symbol for the root operation.
One peculiar square root is for number 10: 
 This
is because the inverse of this number is a fractal of the same exact number 
 We can approach the above from a different perspective
involving 
the 
number 
1 
rather 
than 
10, 
where 
.

The formal solution to 
 is the two, numerically identical,
principal roots 
. However, we just found two fractally identical
numbers, differing only by a decimal point, such that when multiplied
together, they produce 1 also. To find this unique root of number 1, we
multiply it by 10, then we find its principal square root p. The number 1
will then be equal to 
.

This unique root of 1 is capable of reproducing the same kind of
rooting for any other number. For example, taking number 5 as the
radicand, 
we 
find 
and 
. We call this new root the Square Fractal Root,
and we use the radical fractal sign 
 to indicate its implementation. We
also call the value 
 the Greater Fractal Root (GFR) of y and the
other root (GFR/10) the Lesser Fractal Root (LFR). Both roots can be
either positive or negative similar to the principal square root. In fact, these
two square roots, the principal and the fractal, are the only square roots a
number can have, depending on its order of magnitude. So, for number 5
again, 
 
but 
, 
, 
 = 
 etc. Thus, the fractal root
is a mathematical operation that introduces a different perspective to what
we mean by the square root, generating two roots instead of one, with both
being identical but for the position of their decimal points. Below is a list of
the GFR of some constants of interest.

Table 27: The square fractal roots of some of the most important constants of nature
 
The square fractal root can provide different methods to derive
some fundamental physical and mathematical constants. For example,
adding 0.3 to the LFR of 1 results in a number almost identical to Planck’s
length (1.616229×10−35 m) minus 1: 
 This Planck’s
length is defined as the unit measurement that light will travel in one unit of
Planck’s time (5.39 × 10 −44 s). It is also the scale at which quantum
gravitational effects are believed to become noticeable. Additionally, the
fractal roots enable a geometrical representation of this fundamental

constant that is based on a circle having a diameter of 6-units and defined
by the two values of 
 and 
, as illustrated in the figure below.
(And again, we find number 6 playing a major role in defining constants, as
it did in the wave theory of constants.)

Figure 131: Planck’s length, calculated from the fractal root of 1, is defined by a circle of 6-units’
diameter.
 
Another usage is to calculate 
 from the LFR(1) as follows: 
 The offset from the real value of π is less than 0.015%.
Additionally, we can calculate e from the fractal roots of 0.718, 2.68… and
0.268…,  as follows: 
 We can also calculate the
principal 
square 
root 
of 
3 
from 
the 
LFR(1) 
as 
follows: 
.
One very important relationship in math is the Euler Identity,
defined as 
, where i is the imaginary number, the square root of
-1. Interestingly, if we replace i with the lesser fractal root of 1, and take the
inverse of the e-fraction (
) the answer to the above equation will
equal to 
, almost identical to the fine structure constant. This is
one form of Euler identity that is no less important than the familiar one, if
not more important.
Geometrically speaking, the square fractal root maps one shape to
another, where both shapes have identical areas but with different
dimensions. In other words, for some area A, using the principal square
root, we assume the area to be that of a square with the sides having equal
values (a ratio of 1). By using the fractal root, however, we assume the

shape to be of a rectangle with its sides fractally identical, having a ratio of
10 instead of 1.

Figure 132: Using the fractal root to transform a square of area A into a rectangle having the same
area but with the ratio of the sides equal to 10.
 
For the case of a circle, the area is calculated as 
. Using
the principal square root, the radius is calculated from the area as 
. The fractal root, on the other hand, generates two fractal values of r. In
other words, we are assuming the area A to belong to an ellipse with the
major and minor axis (a and b) being the GFR and LFR of A, respectively: 
.
 
Figure 133: The fractal root transforms a circle of area A into an ellipse of the same area with a/b =
10.
 
Even though the areas stay unchanged for both shapes, before and
after mapping, the perimeters do change. For example, in the case of the
square with unity dimensions, its perimeter is 4×1 = 4. However, the
fractally mapped rectangle has dimensions of (3.162… and 0.3162…),
producing a perimeter of: (3.162… + 0.3162…) × 2 = 6.9570… > 4. With
the dimensions increasing in value, the perimeters of the square-shaped
polygon get bigger in comparison to the rectangular fractal one, as shown in
the figure below.

The perimeters’ ratio will equal 1 for the single case of a square’s
dimension of the magical value of 3.025 units, calculated as follows.

For a square of sides x and a perimeter Pp and fractally mapped
rectangle of sides
 and a perimeter Pf: 
, 
. 
For 
.
For the case of a circle and an ellipse, the magical value is 
units. Interestingly, for dimensions equal to the fundamental constants π and
e, the ratios are 1.0191 and 0.948, respectively, both very close to unity.
(Also, notice how the digital roots of 3.025 and 5.05 are equal to 1.)
 
Figure 134: A graph for the ratio between the square and the rectangle’s perimeters. A value of 1
occurs at the magical number of 3.025.
 
There could be some properties for the fractally mapped shapes that
make them special to nature in one form or another, similar to those based
on the golden ratio Φ , for example. As we have learned in Part I, the
golden ratio division ensures that the ratio of the whole to the bigger part is
equal to that of the bigger part to the smaller one, as shown below. A
rectangle with such a ratio for its sides is believed to be harmonious and
pleasing to the eye.
The fractal root, on the other hand, is where one shape can morph
into another while preserving the area and maintaining a perfect balance
between the sides. Thus, the fractal root is another method that nature can
implement to create self-similar fractal copies of itself, however, in
dynamic geo-numerical balance.

ii-                The Cube Fractal Root
 
The fractal root is not restricted to square ones only; we can also
extend it to include cube roots and beyond.
To find the cube fractal root of a number, we start by multiplying it
by 100 and then taking its principal cube root. So, for number 1, the cube
root of 100 is equal to 4.6415888… Multiplying this number with its 1/10
value 
twice 
results 
in 
the 
number 
1 
back 
again: 
. And similar to the square
fractal root, here also we have two roots: the GFR and the LFR (a couple of
them). Below we list the cube-GFRs for the same constants we encountered
in the previous section. Notice how the fractal cube root of the fine
structure constant is almost equal to 24, a number of particular importance
to the Wave Theory of Numbers and Prime Factorization, as well as the
magical quartet.

Table 28: The cube fractal roots of some of the most important constants of nature.
 
Geometrically speaking, the fractal cube root transforms a cube into
a parallelogram with fractally identical dimensions while keeping the
volume the same, as shown in the figure below. It also transforms a sphere
into an elongated spheroidal shape.
Figure 135: Using the cube fractal root to transform a cube of into a parallelogram having
the same volume but with fractal ratios for the sides.
 
Similar to the 2-dimensional case, where the perimeters are
different for the two shapes, in this case, it is the areas that are different,
with their ratios increasing with dimensionality, as shown below.

The ratio of the areas is equal to 1 at exactly x = 1.36089… And for the
value of 1.37 (a fractal of α ), the ratio is 1.009, very close to 1, just like π
and e in the square fractal root case. (This alludes to a possible relationship
between mathematical and physical constants on the one hand and their
corresponding principal-to-fractal perimeters or areas ratios equal to 1 on
the other.)
 
Figure 136: A graph for the ratio between the cube and parallelogram’s areas. The ratio value of 1
occurs at the magical number of 1.36.
 
Higher orders of fractal roots, like the fourth or fifth root, etc., can
be found in a similar manner. For the 4th fractal root case, we multiply the
radicand by 10 and then take its principal root. The four fractal roots will
consist of one GFR and three LFRs. So, for number 16, we find 
. 
Consequently: 
Therefore, to calculate the nth fractal root of any number x, we start
by multiplying x with 10n-1 and then take its principal nth root: 
.
The root we get is the GFR of x. The roots always involve a single GFR,
along with (n-1) LFRs. So, 1 LFR for square fractal roots, 2 LFRs for cube
fractal roots, and so on. 
Even though the fractal root is mainly derived from applying the
principal root operation, there is still a crucial difference between the two.
In the principal root, we can write it in terms of successive roots with
smaller orders, something like 
, and 2×2×2×2 = 16.

However, doing the same for the fractal root produces something entirely
different:

 
 
 
Now, 
, and 
,
with the total equal to 16; however, the four roots are not identical anymore,
neither in their number sequencing nor in their decimal point (
). Therefore, not all mathematical operations that
work for the principal root will also work for the fractal one.
Generally speaking, the fractal root provides a novel approach to
derive numbers from each other, whether directly, as in the LFR/GFR, or in
a bit more complicated manner, as we saw above for the many fundamental
constants. Additionally, square and higher fractal roots have the ability to
transform geometrical shapes into ones having ratios of fractal nature,
similar in principle to those based on the golden section and other
fundamental constants, rendering it one mathematical operation of a unique
geo-numerical essence.

Part III
Music and Sound
 
“I would teach children music, physics, and philosophy; but most importantly music,
for the patterns in music and all the arts are the keys to learning.”
                     -Plato
 
In their endeavor to understand the nature of music, scientists and
philosophers have attempted to formulate the experience within a numerical
and mathematical context. Of the earliest attempts is that of the Greek
philosopher Pythagoras. One story goes, while passing by a hammersmith
shop, Pythagoras realized that specific hammers produced pleasant sounds
when struck together while others didn’t. He eventually concluded that for
specific weight ratios, such as 2:1, 4:3, and 3:2, the hammers produced
consonance notes, while for other ratios, the notes were dissonant. While
this story's authenticity cannot be verified, the key concepts sure can;
specific ratios do create pleasant notes while others don’t. So, we have the
octave with ratios of (2:1), the perfect 4th (4:3), the perfect 5th (3:2), etc.
Since then, music and numbers were forever bonded. Nevertheless,
there were always some discrepancies between exact numerical models and
the correct notes in which musicians tune their instruments. In this section,
we will show that not only exact numerical models can be made to fit the
correct musical tones, but geometrical shapes as well. This will enhance our
understanding of the music’s theory, which, in return, will allow us to
retune the musical scale into the correct natural Pythagorean tuning of 432
Hz.

Chapter 1- The Geometry of Sound
 
“There is geometry in the Humming of the String. There is Music in the Spacing of the Spheres.”
           -Pythagoras
 
 
i-                   The 432 Hz Tuning: Geometry in Music
 
As we explained earlier, music and math belong to two different
regions of our brains. And while our eyes are in a continuous search for
numbers and ratios within the dimensions of the images they see, our ears
are in the lookup for the same ratios, but in the tones they hear instead. 
All those mathematicians who were either professional musicians
or simply enjoyed the experience elaborated on the two fields' subtle links.
These links, of course, are more between numbers and music than they are
between complicated mathematical functions and the latter.  Special ratios
and magical constants have all been expressed within compositions to
create this unified experience of numbers and music, performing together in
a state of harmony and wholeness. And as we will show, music is a conduit
not only to evoke emotions and feelings; it can also create physical
geometric patterns that are unique to the tones that produced them. By the
same token, geometry creates a matrix through which the various notes can
be organized, producing a powerful visual image that transforms the flat 1-
dimensional musical scale into an elaborated 2-dimensional and even 3-
dimensional projection.
Figure 137: The various notes’ ratios played on a string, along with their respective names.

Studying individual sound tones can be achieved by examining
their physical qualities, such as frequency, wavelength, amplitude, etc. For
music, however, the task is more complicated; we need to study the
phenomenon as a whole, as music is not a momentary experience; it can
only be perceived over time. Moreover, putting forth a mathematical model
that describes some aspects of music is feasible, as we saw earlier in
Pythaogras ratios. However, formalizing the whole experience within the
constraint of a few math qualities or quantities is almost an impossible task.
There is so much involved in the music experience that adds more variables
and dimensions to its theory.
We will investigate one of these dimensions by illustrating the
connection musical notes have with the geometry of certain regular
polygons.
One of the most effective ways to quantify musical notes is by
measuring their frequencies, the rate of one complete vibration per second,
measured in units of inverse second or Hertz (Hz). These notes repeat
within a harmonic ratio called the octave calculated by doubling or halving
any Hertz value. There are a total of 12 notes to the Western musical scale,
with the 13th being equivalent to the first, only an octave higher. For
example, notes A4 = 216 Hz, A5 = 432 Hz, and A6 = 864 Hz are all different
octaves or pitches of the same A note (the subscripts are references to each
note’s respective octave). We used the tuning pitch of A5 = 432 Hz instead
of the familiar one of 440 Hz because it is an essential requirement to
illustrate the connection between geometry and sound. Below is a figure
illustrating two whole octaves tuned to the 432 Hz pitch. Notice how
moving up the note scale requires progressively smaller distances, like
guitar frets.

Figure 138:  Two octaves and their notes. Notice how the distances between the notes’ frequencies
get smaller as we progress from the 5th to the 6th octave.
Musical tones are often distributed around circles, very much like
the D-circles, to reflect the cyclic behavior of the octave. In fact, the way
the musical scale develops is very similar to a spiral or vortex, with each
loop corresponding to one full octave, as shown below. Writing the musical
notes in a spiraling fashion is a perfect representation as each turn of the
spiral resembles the other, indicating how each octave is similar in its
constitution to the previous one, however higher in pitch, which is reflected
through the spiral ascending and expanding twists. In fact, the spiral is such
a perfect geo-numeric pattern able to represent so many phenomena, as we
will discover later on. It is an optimum unification principle.
Figure 139: The octave progresses in a spiraling manner, similar to how D-circles do.

 
Connecting sound with shapes is not a new idea. It is well
established that certain frequencies of sound create specific geometrical
patterns, such as in Chladni figures (shown below), in reference to the
German physicist and musician Ernst Chladni (1756 - 1827), who generated
geometrical shapes using a violin bow drawn over a piece of metallic slab
covered with sand. They can also be produced through an instrument called
the Harmonograph or even using tanks filled with water. Nowadays, these
shapes are commonly known as Cymatics.
Producing shapes through sound may not seem very intriguing at
first. After all, sound is basically a vibrational phenomenon, and when a
piece of metal with sand on top of it vibrates, as in Chladni’s patterns, the
sand particles will also vibrate and move around, forming different shapes.

However, when the vibrations form perfectly symmetric
geometrical patterns, this is when the phenomenon becomes much more
interesting.  
Figure 140:  A sample of Chladni music-induced patterns. Note the perfect symmetry of the
geometry.
 
Even though producing these sound-generated shapes is an easy
process, putting forth a mathematical formalism capable of fully explaining
it is very difficult and complicated. This is because these shapes not only
depend on the sound notes and their properties, they also depend on the
material of the vibrating surface, the medium used to create the shapes, the
ambient temperature, among many other factors. Nevertheless, on a
fundamental level, we will show that linking music to geometry can be
achieved, and with a high degree of precision. We start by setting up the
table below, which lists the harmonic relationships between notes on the
chromatic scale and their degrees’ references. The Length field refers to the
notes’ ratios for a string length of 12 units. By taking the values of the
Length field in Decimal and multiply them with 360, we get the Degrees
reference for the notes. For example, 11/12 = 0.916 and 0.916×360 = 330 ◦,
and so is for the rest of the notes.
The Internal Angle field is calculated by subtracting the Degrees
field from the starting point, being the note A5. Therefore, for the note B5
(468 Hz), the internal angle is A5° – B5° or 360°-300° = 60°, which

corresponds to an equilateral triangle. Moving a half-step from A5 to A#5
spans a 30° angle, a shape commonly used as a symbol for the compass.

The note C5 produces an inscribed square since its internal angle of
90° is 1/4th of the 360° unit-circle. Note C#5 produces an inscribed hexagon
since the angle is 120°.

The pattern continues through the audible spectrum of sound and is
calculated for one full octave, as shown in the table below. The Arc Length
field is calculated by measuring the angular distance around the circle from
the starting point (note A5). For example, note C#5 produces an inscribed
hexagon since the arc length of 60° is 1/6th of the unit circle, meaning there
would be a total of 6 equal sides to the polygon, and so for the rest of the
notes.

Table 30: The internal angles and the arc length of the various notes and the polygons they would
correspond to.
 
All further progressions of regular polygonal geometry follow the
same logic with perfect symmetry, as shown below. Notes F5, F#5, G5, and
G#5 correlate to polygons of 48-, 57-, 75-, and 150-sides. Therefore, they are
not shown as they closely resemble a circle.
 
Figure 141:  Note C and C# create a square and a hexagon, respectively.
 

The F#5 note is of particular interest, as its length is equal to
6.18/12. The number 6.18 is equivalent to 10/ Φ , where Φ  is the golden
section.

Hence F#5 can be written as 
. The value of 6.18/12 =
0.515 is almost identical to Φ /π, and the number 0.8333… is nothing by
5/6, another Hexapentakis relationship.
Worth mentioning is that the two notes used to tune the musical
scale, A5 and C5, correspond to the circle and the square, the two opposite
shapes that have the same sum of internal angles (360 ◦). (These are the
same two shapes that mathematicians and philosophers have been
struggling to unify in what is known as squaring the circle problem, which
we discussed earlier.)
Figure 142: All notes values plotted around a circle, connecting the musical scale to arc lengths,
interior angles, and natural progressions of regular polygons.
 
The pentagon correlates to dissonant or enharmonic gap notes like
B#5, which are not used in the classical chromatic scale of music. Therefore,
this shape is missing from the list of polygons in the above table (the
decagon is also missing; however, we can think of a decagon as double
pentagons). Also missing from the list is the heptagon, the nonagon, and the
hendecagon, which correspond to symmetries that are not observed in
nature. This is of particular interest, as not only the musical notes

correspond exactly to certain polygons, they correspond only to those
polygons observed in nature and dismiss those that are not.

Pentagons, however, are very much observed in nature and on many levels.
Thus, maybe we should reconsider those gap notes that correspond to this
geometry and reevaluate their role. They may not be that pleasant to our
ears; however, they may play an important role in nature in a manner that
we do not yet understand.
Figure 143: Two pentagons, one in reverse to the other, correlating to dissonant or gaps in the
musical scale.
 
We were able to establish the above precise correspondence
between the twelve notes of the octave and regular geometrical polygons
only when we implement the pitch tuning of 432 Hz for the A5 note instead
of the modern value of 440 Hz. This fundamental number is crucial to our
understanding of music, geometry, and physics as well, being the result of
multiplying the central number of the wave matrix (6) with that which
defined geometry (72).
All the above establishes a reconsideration of the standard pitch
tuning value as the modern value of 440 Hz destroys the geometrical
correspondence entirely. But tuning instruments to 432 Hz is believed to
produce notes that are not very pleasant to our ears. How can we reconcile
this?
In the next section, we solve the major 3rd problem and show how
by a slight change of the temperament tuning, we can achieve a 432 Hz for
the A5 note and a perfect musical experience.

ii-                The Precise Temperament Tuning
 
Just Tuning requires the Pythagorean Comma (1.0136) adjustment
to fix the major 3rd problem where the ratio 5/4 is not the correct ratio for
this major. This is because the 5/4 ratio is wholly inadequate as a variable
approach for the major 3rd, as, if it continues, it will never achieve a correct
doubling of an octave, e.g., 843 Hz vs. the correct doubling value of 864
Hz. This is the interval that totally destroys the Just Tuning as a viable
tuning despite its clear mathematical correspondences for all other notes as
well as geometrical shapes, as we showed above.
Equal Temperament is also problematic because it simply cuts the
octave range of frequency into 12 equal parts (based on √2) where there is a
slight variation between tonal transitions exhibiting yet again wave
behavior. Moreover, equal temperament loses a lot of the benefit of the
base-9 mathematical system as the numbers may no longer sum to 9 in
modular arithmetic.Tuning requires correct mathematical ratios for the
perfect 5th, major 3rd, and octave doubling. All the ratios of the other notes
can be found within these critical ratios. The table below lists the intervals
and their ratios and the difference between the Just Scale values and their
corresponding Equal Temperament values. The intervals in shaded gray are
the ones that need to be adjusted; however, as the 5th dissonant is inaudible,
it requires a minute adjustment that is basically unnecessary.

Table 31: Table of music notes and their ratios. The major 3rd and the 5th music intervals require
adjustment in Just Tuning.
A potential solution to this conundrum works by simply replacing
the major 3rd ratio of 1.25 with 1.26 (derived as 21/3 instead of 5/4); this
brings the entire scale into very close equivalence with temperament tuning.
This new system is called Precise Temperament Tuning.
But how does this new tuning sound? Based on the ratios and the
very close equivalence to Equal Temperament values in 432hz, it will sound
great, as early testing has revealed. Another plus is that all the new precise
frequencies sum to 9 naturally, just like the sum of angles of all regular
polygons/polyhedra/polytopes do.
Below we list the Precise Temperament tuning values for the 5th
octave.

The mathematics of this equal temperament Precise Tuning
overcomes the acoustic problem of shifting the tonal center where the
spectrum of overtones will suddenly fall out of Just mathematical
alignment, and the music gets shifted audibly out of tune. The table below

number 2.
The precise tuning of 1.26 has many advantages where it achieves
mathematical interval perfection of the major 2nd, perfect 5th, and perfect 4th,
along with mathematical perfection of the precise major 3rd interval (
),
which doubles the octave. It also enables a mathematical approach that is
versatile across keys. Moreover, it integrates geometric mod(9) numbers
series matching all geometric angular sums, with an overtone ascribed to
decimal extensions, as we showed earlier.
The Precise Tuning allows all musical chords (both major and
minor ones) to arrange neatly within tetrahedral relationships that
commence with the note D and extend through the undertones of perfect 5th
and major 3rd to encompass all notes. In this structure, the mathematical
relationships between musical notes, including minor 2nd, major 4th, minor
6th, and 7th  reveal themselves elegantly as merely inherent to the
geometrical structure they naturally form (tetrahedra coalesce to form a
cuboctahedron). These geometrical-musical arrangements are shown below.

Figure 144: Geometrical precise temperament tuning embedded within a tetrahedral arrangement of
the Flower of Life.
 
The musical chords of perfect 5th, major 3rd, 4th, and 7th, as well as
the 2nd and the 6th, all have inherent geometrical relationships in just tuning.
All major and minor chords/keys are represented in the cuboctahedron
structure shown below (the keys not listed below would appear on the other
side of the structure).

 
Figure 145: (Left) Just Scale Tuning, a musical geometry where the cuboctahedron informs all major
and minor chords. Those keys that are not shown would appear on the other side of the structure
(Right). Legends are the same as the previous figure.
 
The above geo-musical structure informs which transitions between
keys are easily accomplished. In other words, the full understanding of the
music experience cannot be accomplished without adequate knowledge of
numbers and geometry. This may be what Pythagoras encrypted over two
millennia ago, and it is now the time for this encryption to be broken and
for his message to be deciphered. The idea that the Flower of Life can work
as a blueprint for musical chords is not surprising, given that circular waves
doubling and interference can also create the 12-based configuration where
these musical notes emerge naturally, as we discussed earlier in the wave
theory of numbers section, reproduced below with more details.
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 146: Numerical circular waves forming musical chords through their interference pattern.

The same number used in achieving this tuning, 
 = 1.26, is related to one
famous mathematical problem of doubling the cube. The origin of this
problem goes way back to ancient Greece, where the legend goes that the
citizens of Delos, an ancient Greek city, consulted the oracle at Delphi on
how to overcome a plague that hit them. The oracle replied that in order to
appease the deity Apollo, who is responsible for the plague, they need to
double his altar, which was in the shape of a cube.
 
Figure 147: The Cube of Delos. Doubling the size of the cube is equivalent to doubling its volume. A
cube of size 1 unit will double into a cube of size 
 units.
 
Therefore, given a cube having sides of 1 unit, what would its size
be after doubling it. Of course, the answer is 
, which allegedly came
from Plato, who understood doubling the cube to mean doubling its volume.
Plato, hence, advised the Delians to study math and geometry to calm down
the angry Apollo.
This is an interesting story that sheds light on the important status
numbers and geometry used to hold in ancient civilizations. And, as it
seems, 1.26 is one such important number that does not only solve the
problem of doubling the cube but doubling the octave as well.
Numbers, geometry, and music; disciplines that may look different
at first; however, they are nothing but a different perspective to the same
idea. 

Chapter 2: Base-12 Numeric System
“Wherever there is number, there is beauty.”
-Proclus
 
As explained in Part I, the wave pattern replicates every multiple of
6, which doubles into 12, then 24, etc. Number 12 is unique in particular, as
it can be found on all levels of the natural world. For example, we have 12
monochromatic colors, 12 notes for one octave, 12 months per year, etc.
The day is made of 12 hours, as well as the night, which may have
originated from the fact that there are 12 full lunations in one solar year.
Mathematically speaking, it is known that the infinite sum of all
natural numbers 
 is equal to the unexpected value of 
, first proven
by Euler. This is a very counter-intuitive result that seems to make no sense,
except it is used in many important theories, such as string theory, and
proven to be correct. This property does imply that number 12 has a unique
status among all other numbers, at least in its 1/x form.
The numeric ratio of numbers 6 and 5, which correspond to the
Hexapentakis configuration, is equal to 1.2, and 12×5 = 60, the numbers
used by the Sumerians in their sexagesimal-based numeric system. Even the
two most fundamental constants of π and Φ  are related through this
specific ratio, where 
. Therefore, number 12 is embedded right at
the heart of creation.
But so is number 9, which is the base of our numeric system. And
we have seen how all musical tones have digital roots of 9, as well as the
angles of geometrical figures, such as in the magical angle of 720°, as well
as all the completion symmetries of the D-Space, such as in the magical
quartet.
So, what could the most natural base-system be, 9-based or 12-
based? Or could it be both? Could a base-12 integer system be lying hidden
within the current base-9 numerical system?
In this hypothetical hybrid system, we would have the basic nine
numbers, from 1 to 9, along with another three that are embedded in
between them for a total of twelve. These three new numbers should be
irrational, which renders them hidden from appearing in the rational number
space. Just like dark matter is lying hidden within our universe of light; still,
its effect can be felt by examining the movement of farthest galaxies.

The position of the first new number should be around numbers 3,
6, and 9. These are the only numbers that have irrational reciprocals that
loop on themselves, creating spiral-like dynamics: 0.333…, 0.1666…, and
0.111… (the inverse of 7 creates a

wave, as we have seen before.) Therefore, the optimum positioning of the
first new number would be between 3 and 4, which we call Phio (a term
derived to reflect that it is right before number four). As for the second
number, it is between numbers 6 and 7, and we call it Siev (a kind of
between six and seven). The third number is called Eno (mirror image of
one), coming right after number 9, as shown below.
Figure 148: The way the new numbers of phio, siev, and eno integrate within the first nine numbers.
Their new symbols are shown in the illustration: rotated 6 for phio, rotated 3 for siev, and rotated 9
for eno.
 
The main reasoning behind their exact positioning comes from their
values as well as their correspondence with music and the digital root math.
This is because planting these numbers in the specified positions creates a
perfect correspondence between music, especially the major third scale, 
and the fundamental triplet group of [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], and [3, 6, 9].
From the above figure, if phio didn’t exist, the major third will span
from note A to note D, corresponding to numbers 1 to 5. However, if we
want to create a triplet match, that is for the major third to start with number
1 and end with number 4 and from 4 to 7 (of the same triplet group [1, 4,
7]), two numbers should exist between 3 and 4 and between 6 and 7,
respectively. This will shift the major third to span from A:1 to C#:4, and
from C#:4 to F:7, etc. In this hybrid system, major thirds scales will
correspond perfectly to all triplet groups: A#:2 – D:5, B:3 – D#:6, and so
on. It is as if numbers possess overtones.
If positioning these new numbers in between the other nine was
somehow straightforward, calculating their values is a bit trickier. One
prerequisite property to bear in mind is that the sum of irrational phio and
siev should equal to eno, an irrational number between 9 and 10. This is a

complimentary property similar to how rational numbers such as 3 and 6
add up to 9.

But where do we start looking for these numbers? Our research may
provide us with some hints that can direct us. For example, the right angle
triangle is of utmost importance to our thesis, and we expect these three
numbers to observe this relationship, all of them or two of them at least. To
ensure irrationality, we can include the square root in the calculation as it is
sure to generate irrational numbers when its argument is non-square
numbers, such as prime numbers, for example. Numbers 2 and 3 are perfect
candidates for being the seeds for the new numbers as both are non-square
numbers, and they are the basis of the binary/trinary numbers.
As it turned out, we can fulfill all the above through one simple
right triangle whose hypotenuse equal to √3-1 = 0.732…, an irrational
number. To fix the other two sides, we use a right triangle that fits inside the
Flower of Life. With the hypotenuse value of √3-1, the base will equal half
this value (
) and the height will equal to 
.
Interestingly, these two irrational values, if multiplied by 10, will
satisfy all the requirements of our new numbers perfectly, with phio = 
 (between 3 and 4), and siev = 
 = 6.33974…
(between 6 and 7), and both are irrational, and they add up to eno = 9.999…
an irrational number between 9 and 10. (And with these dimensions, the
areas of the small circles of the flower will equal to π-3, with a percentage
difference of 0.04% only.)

Figure 149: The Flower of Life superimposed on an equilateral triangle having dimensions that
embody the values of: 
 and 
 for phio and siev,
respectively.

Considering the geometrical representations of numbers from 1 to
9, those of the three new numbers, phio, siev, and eno, can also be deduced.
As shown below, the first three numbers of [1, 2, 3], coming right before
phio, can be combined into one equilateral triangle inscribed within a circle,
which becomes the proposed form of phio. In a similar fashion, the forms of
siev and eno can be deduced from the geometrical patterns corresponding to
[4, 5, 6] and [7, 8, 9], respectively, as shown below.
 
Figure 150: Progression of base-12 integer positions using ascending polygrams of equal line
segments equal to 1 unit in length.
 
With all polygons having side-lengths of 1 unit, the first polygram
forming an equilateral triangle delineate a circle (green) having a
circumference value of 3.660254 (phio), after using a sexagesimal
(transverse) conversion from decimal (scalar). The square that corresponds
to integer 4 is too large to inscribe within the same triangle's circle.

Similarly, numbers 5 will correspond to a hexagram that is too small to
inscribe within the same circle. 

The same is true for 7 and 8, which are both too small to inscribe within it.
Only numbers [3, 6, 9] form polygrams that fit perfectly within the original
circle proportions.  These nodal points of polygram inscription with the
circle proceed with a 6.365 circumferential value (non-overlapping
segments of the circles to form 'sieve') and 9.999… circumferential value
for eno. 
Figure 151: The geometrical representations of phio (top) and siev (bottom) along with their
dimensions values and base-10 (scalar)/base-12 (transverse) conversions.

The eno number value of 9.999… is mathematically equivalent to
10 (or 1 in digital root math). To prove this, consider the following, let say
n = eno/10 = 0.99999… (all nines to infinity). Now, we perform the
following mathematical operation: 10n – n = 9n = 9.9999… - 0.9999…  =
9. Therefore we have 9n = 9, which leads to n = 1. On the other hand, the
digital root of eno D(9.999…) is equal to 9, which is equivalent to 0 in the
regular number space. Therefore, the eno number is the number that stands
for the dual polarity of 1 and 0, a superposition between the two. It is the
Alpha and Omega of the numbers, combined in one value.
Figure 152: the circumference of phio + siev equals that of eno, calculated in both numeric bases.
 
In this sense, we can consider phio as the alpha and siev as the
omega, which is also reflected in the shapes of their unique symbols ( α ,
ω ). And due to their irrationality, they are unpolarized by definition; neither
even nor odd, and not having definite digital roots either. Consequently,
they won’t appear in the rational number space; however, their presence is
essential for the balance of the numeric scale as well as the whole universe,
which will become more obvious in the next part when we couple the 12-
based hybrid numeric scale with the elementary forces of nature to create
one final geo-numeric matrix that unifies all.

Part IV
Physical Science
 
“Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas
imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution.”
  
-Albert Einstein
 
 
It might be a bit difficult to understand where imagination would fit
in empirical sciences. After all, science is built upon facts, hard proofs, and
repeated experiments. Of course, making discoveries is an important aspect
of the scientific process, but this is usually done either by expanding on an
already understood model, mathematically, or experimentally, or by
accident, as is usually the case. Imagination, however, is not something a
scientist is expected to utilize in his research.
That being said, the reality is very different as some of the most
important scientific discoveries and breakthroughs came about through
imagination; by thinking outside the mainstream orthodoxy. And there is no
other field to utilize our imagination in unlocking its secrets better than
physics.
Physics is the science that tries to understand nature by examining
its every aspect, from the microcosm to the macrocosm. Many other fields
of study that do not academically fall under the umbrella of physics, like
biology and chemistry, etc., must employ physical concepts at their utmost
fundamental levels. Even the DNA will have to work based on physical
laws. This is why in this book, we concentrate mainly on the physical
aspect of natural sciences, as by unlocking the secrets of physics, we unlock
the secrets of almost all other scientific fields.
We will investigate the three main aspects of physical science:
space-time, matter, and fundamental forces. We do so by employing our
discoveries thus far, as well as our imagination, of course. The digital root,
the wave theory of numbers, the 12-based numeric system, etc., will all
combine together to form one complete geo-numeric picture able to explain
what our universe is really made of and how it works. 
And even though we will offer no experimental proof to our thesis,
however, we do believe that the numerical reasoning we propose will feel

sound and logical, especially to those who appreciate expanding their
horizon and freeing their minds.

Chapter 1- SpaceTime
 
“The ether is not a fantastic creation of the speculative philosopher;
it is as essential to us as the air we breathe.”
-J. J. Thompson
 
i-                   The Ether
 
The concept of space-time has become one of the fundamental
tenets of physics, especially since Einstein's famous General Relativity
theory. In this theory, the 3-dimensions of space, combined with a fourth
one for time, create a mathematical fabric through which many of the
physical phenomena, especially gravity, can have a suitable explanation.
The main idea of Einstein’s theory is that mass causes the spacetime fabric
to curve, creating the effect of gravity, along with other consequences, such
as time dilation, length contraction, etc.
One of the most important tenets of this 4-dimensional manifold is
the idea that the speed of light is constant in any frame of reference,
independent of the light source's motion. As counter-intuitive as this idea
may be, most physicists accept it to be true. Another tenet is that space is
nothing but a vacuum that contains nothing, or at least nothing important,
which is how physicists deal with it today. But this wasn’t always the case,
as even after Einstein proposed his theory, many still believed that space is
filled with the ultimate fundamental substance, the ether.
In 1887, physicists Albert Michelson and Edward Morley
conducted an experiment that has drastically changed the way physicists
viewed the universe. They sent two beams of light, one in the direction of
the earth's motion, while the other is perpendicular to it. They wanted to
record any minute difference in the two beams by studying their
interference pattern. There was non. This outcome of the famous
Michelson-Morley interferometer experiment has been accepted by the
scientific community as proof of the non-existence of the ether, a substance
thought for thousands of years to permeate the whole universe and through
which light was supposed to propagate, just like waves propagate through
the water. As a result, many theories that implemented the ether in its thesis
was either modified or disregarded, such as the Vortex Theory of atoms, as
the ether deemed either non-existing or insignificant. But what was this
ether supposed to be?

The most comprehensive scientific description of the ether came from
Nikola Tesla (1856 – 1943), the famous inventor,  and J. J. Thomson (1856-
1940), the discoverer of the electron and a Nobel Prize laurite. Tesla
believed that the ether is made of carriers (negative and positive) immersed
in an insulating fluid and are always in a whirling motion forming a kind of
“micro helices.” The properties of this ether vary, corresponding to
movement, mass, and the existence of electromagnetic fields. In fact, he
believed that all the energy that exists in the matter is received from the
surrounding ether. Hence the ether is more like an energy repository capable
of imparting its energy to all forms of matter, living and nonliving. (In
today's terms, this energy is best paralleled by the so-called zero Point
Energy ZPE or even dark energy.)
The ether was also used to explain the forces of nature, such as
electricity and magnetism, which are disturbances through the ether, and
gravity, which the pressure of the ether itself.  The ether was also used to
describe the elementary particles and atoms, especially through the Vortex
Theory of Atoms, where the elementary particles are believed to be made of
specific geometric shapes sustained in the ether through their vorticular
motion.
But does the ether really exist? Or could it be that all these brilliant
etheric scientists have simply got it wrong? Many scientists have come up
with different experiments validating the existence of the ether, such as the
Sagnac experiment performed in 1913 and the Michelson-Gale experiment
performed in 1925. Many also have criticized the Michelson-Morley
experiment, and others like it, as being wrongly conducted or interpreted.
The famous physicist John Stewart Bell (1928-1990), who proved the
existence of nonlocal effects in nature in the famous theory that carries his
name “Bell’s Theorem,” suggested that the ether may very well exist and
that its existence can offer solutions to many of modern physics paradoxes,
including the famous EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) paradox. He argued
that the denial of the existence of the ether was based on more philosophical
grounds than on scientific ones.
So why wouldn’t mainstream scientists acknowledge the existence
of the ether?
One part of the problem results from scientists interpreting the data
coming out of experiments to suit their already held convictions. The other

part has to do with ego, as it is often very hard for scientists to accept new
ideas that will challenge their long-held beliefs and way of thinking. (One
such belief, that Einstein’s General Relativity is incompatible with the ether
as a detectable substance.) Harder still is to accept the same

ideas you already discredited; to accept something new is one thing, but to
admit that you were wrong is another.
Nevertheless, similar concepts to the ether have slipped into the
scientific mainstream, but under disguise and with many different names,
such in the Zero Point Energy (ZPE), for example, or even under the elusive
dark matter concept, which is also based on very elementary charges,
similar to what Tesla and others had proposed. Subatomic particles, like
electrons, are thought of as excitations of a field by mainstream physicists.
But wouldn’t a vortex within the ether also be considered a kind of
excitation of the ether field?
In the near future, physicists will most probably revert to the same
old ether; nevertheless, to save their faces and reputations, it will all be
under new names and more sophisticated scientific jargon.
 
The Numerical Ether
As this book is mainly about numbers and how they reside at the
core of the structure of the universe, the ether being (given it exists) should
be the most number-structured element. So, let us start by imagining a sea
of etheric charges or carriers, as Tesla and others had predicted. We
numerically represent these charges with the number 9, filling all space and
with each 9 having the ability to split or polarizes into numbers 3 (negative)
and 6 (positive) due to the presence of charges. We are using this specific
triplet group of [3, 6, 9] because it is the group that captures the essence of
the ether, being a sea filled with energy and vibration, and as we showed
earlier on, number 9 is the number of energy.
Imagine now an electron with a negative charge (numerically
corresponding to 3) situated within this ether. What will happen is that
every etheric 9 will split into 3 and 6, with the latter being the one closer to
the electron. This is because numbers are attracted to those that will
complete them (having a D-sum of 9). This split of etheric carriers will
induce splits in the neighboring carriers and so on. Thus, the presence of the
electron has vibrated throughout the ether and in all directions. The
alignment of these split carriers matches what the lines of an electric field
would look like, consequently giving the correct 1/(square-distance)
dependence of the field as well.
 A positive charge, a proton, with a numeric charge of 6, will have
the opposite kind of etheric charges (number 3) facing it, as shown below.

Consequently, the two charges will feel each other’s presence via the ether’s
carriers and will be attracted to each other. The same situation applies to the
repulsive forces between identical charges.
Figure 153: An electric dipole within the ether. Notice how the individual carriers of the ether will
form the same exact pattern that the field lines of an electric dipole would have formed.
 
But why do the charges get attracted to each other to start with?
The reason is due to the pressure from the insulating medium that surrounds
the carriers. As Tesla, Thompson, and others had suggested, these carriers
create fields of force that facilitate the motion of charged bodies. After the
two charges have polarized the ether in the way shown above and
everything settled, the field lines of the carriers are much denser between
the two charges than on their opposite sides. Therefore, the ether pressure
becomes lower in between the charges and higher in their backs, which
results in a net force that punches them towards each other, as they should.
On the other hand, when the two charges are identical, like
electron-electron, the ether charges will line up such that their field lines
will be less in between, leaving unpolarized ether at the center, where the
two charges face each other. This is because the ether charges will face each
other in equal numeric values of 3 in this case, which is contrary to how
they operate; therefore, they will start deviating from each other, as shown
below. This will lead to higher pressure in the middle with the lower
pressure at the edges where the field lines are denser. Therefore, the natural
outcome is the charges will feel the insulating medium's pressure pushing
them away from each other. 

Figure 154: When two opposing charges are in the vicinity, the ether-pressure will be higher where
the field lines are less dense, which is the center, pushing the charges away from each other.
 
In this sense, the ether is working as an agent by which charges can
feel each other and force them to react based on their intrinsic charges. This
etheric-numeric model, in my opinion, is much more realistic and physical
than an invisible and imaginary electric field propagating through
completely empty space. In fact, the numerical ether may surpass the
electric field picture and in many more ways than by being more physical.
For example, the ether model may explain one mysterious aspect of
physics; the strong force inside the nuclei.
Inside the tiny nucleus of each atom exist protons and neutrons.
The Standard Model of physics theorizes that in order for the highly
repulsive protons to stick to each other in this tiny space, a mysteriously
powerful binding force must mediate between them; the strong force. One
important property of this force is that it has an extremely small range of
effect, about the size of the nucleus (around 10-15 meters), and hence it will
not be felt until the protons come very close to each other.
Using the numerical ether model, we can visualize what would
happen when a proton gets too close to another one, almost touching it, or
maybe with a neutron in between. In this case, the protons will be too close
to each other for any significant ether to exist between them, as shown
below. But it is through the ether that charges feel the presence of each
other. Hence, if no ether exists in-between, then it follows that the
insulating medium's pressure is almost nonexistent, and the pressure from
the ether outside will force them protons and the neutron to remain closely

packed inside the nucleus, given, of course, that the electrons' attractive
force is evenly distributed around

the nuclei (which is what main-stream physics already claims). Once the
distances between the protons get a little bit larger to allow for the ether to
flow back in, the pressure will rise again, and they will fly apart.
With the number of protons and neutrons increasing, the nucleus
will reach a point where its surface area becomes too big for a certain
number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) to completely seal off the ether.
And with these particles being in a continuous state of jiggling and
vibration, the ether may start leaking in. Consequently, some protons will
start to repel each other again, forcing the nuclei to disintegrate or decay
through different processes depending on the specific configuration, such as
the proton emission, neutron emission, spontaneous fission (where the
nucleus breaks into different parts), or the alpha decay (where two protons
and two neutrons are ejected), etc. This ejection will allow the nucleons to
reconfigure their positions and to seal off the ether, hence becoming stable
again.
              
Figure 155: Inside the nucleus, the protons are too close to each other for any ether to exist between
them. Hence, the pressure inside is minimum, and no repulsion will exist between them.
 
But will electrons behave in the same manner; by bringing two
electrons too close to each other, will they stop feeling their charges too and
stick to each other?
Conventional physics will disagree totally, as no strong force effect
has been observed between electrons or between electrons and protons.
Electrons, however, are very different from protons; they are much more
elementary than the protons, with the latter being almost 2,000 times
heavier (precisely, it is 1,836 times) and with its diameters being 1,000
times, at least, bigger than that of the electron. Thus, if we are to think of
the charges of the electrons and the protons being situated at their centers,

then the distance between the charges, let’s say of two protons touching
each other, will be around 1,000 times bigger, at least, than that of two
electrons touching each other.

Figure 156: The proton is around 1000 larger than the electron and requires a million times more
force to bring two electrons to the same distance as two protons.
 
It is already known that the electric force between charges is
proportional to 1/(square distance). Hence, the repulsion force between the
two touching electrons is going to be more than one million times bigger
than that between the two protons, implying it is at least 1 million times
harder to bring the electrons to such close proximity to seal off the ether.
Let alone that the existence of the neutrons between the protons will
definitely help in clearing off the ether without the need for the protons to
get too close to each other, a situation that does not apply to the electrons.
Thus, by proposing a numerical aspect to the ether, we were able to
give alternative explanations to two of the most important phenomena of
physics; electricity and the strong force, along with some of the radioactive
decay processes.  In fact, other fundamental forces, especially gravity and
electromagnetism, may be explained through the numerical ether as well.
Much work is definitely needed in order to have the correct correspondence
between the numerical and the physical forces. Nevertheless, we do believe
that the models we are proposing are interesting enough to be further
pursued by alternate and orthodox physicist as well.
 

ii-                SpaceTime and The Sexagesimal Compass
 
The compass we use to direct us in space uses a base-60 system,
divided into 360 degrees = 60×60, along with fractions of 60 minutes and
60 seconds. Historically, we credit the Chinese with the usage of the first
rudimentary compass; however, the mathematical system of its creation
clearly far predates this to at least as far as our most ancient recorded
civilization: The Sumerians.
Converting compass measurements into decimal is pretty
straightforward. Suppose we have a measurement of x degrees, y minutes,
and z seconds, the decimal value will be 
. So, for a
measurement 
of 
137° 
5’ 
6’’, 
the 
decimal 
value 
is 
simply 
. Reversing the conversion is a bit trickier,
depending on how we interpret the minutes and the seconds. For example,
for a number like 117.23, there would be two different compass values.
Either we consider the whole number after the comma as a minute value;
therefore, 
 which leads to a value of 
, and
the whole compass conversion becomes 117° 13.8’ 0’’. The other option is
to consider the 0.23 to be resulting from adding minutes and seconds
values. Therefore 
, which has the solution of y = 13 and z =
48, and the conversion value becomes 117° 12’ 48’’.
The compass conversion is a cyclic or circular one, which is why it
is used in the longitudinal and altitudinal measurements of points on the
earth, like in the GPS system, for example, as well as in calculating time,
which also measured using the sexagesimal (base-60) system. But if both
time and positioning use the same sexagesimal-based system, can the
compass be used to direct us through time, just like it directs us in space?
Could there be a Directional Compass of time? If it does, this Directional
Compass would possess the same 360 degrees (like any circle) and has 60
minutes for each degree and 60 seconds for each minute as well; therefore,
the extended clock has 360 degrees, 21,600 minutes, and 1,296,000
seconds. These separations create demarcations of spacetime.
As shown below, the compass of time can be overlaid on top of a
compass of direction, which reveals very fundamental and interesting points

of knowledge related to our perception of both time and space. For a start,
each turn of the cycle represents 15 days or approximately half of a month.
This is, therefore, representative of a sine/cosine relationship for each
month. One day is represented by 24 hours (12 hours for the day and 12 for
the night). One year is 24 and 1/3 turns of the Compass: 365 days. It takes
three years to complete a meta cycle (where there is no remaining fraction
toward completion).

Therefore one meta cycle of the Compass of Time is 73 cycles of 15-days
each. (Incidentally, 73 is an up fractal of the fine structure constant:
0.00729735 with a reciprocal value of 137.03599). Additionally, there are
292 cycles in 12 years (or 4 completions of the meta cycles referenced
above.)
 
Figure 157: The sexagesimal compass, with the 360° of the circle divided into the 15 days of a half a
month. The compass orients us through time just as it does through space.
 
The fractal patterns extend in both directions (past and future) from
the moment of today. These extensions use base-60 cycles; therefore, from
the above figure, fractals of time are based on multiples of 60 toward the
past and future: 24×60 = 1,440 minutes; ×60 (or 1/60th of a 24-hour day) =
86,400 seconds (1/3600th of a day); ×60 = 5.184M (1/60th of a second and
therefore 1/216,000th of a day); 311.040M (1/3600th of a second and
therefore 1/1.296M of a day); ×60 = ending the scale reference here at
1/777,600,000th of a day (1.86624×1010 (18.6624 billion time units =
1/216,000th of a second). Note that 1.86624×105 = the nearest whole
number squared approximation for light speed in miles/second (4322 =

186,624). The mile as a measurement in the sexagesimal system holds its
earliest references to Ancient Sumer.

Looking in the opposite direction now (future instead of past
fractals) yields the following incredible symmetry: one day ×60 (a simple
reciprocal 1/x value) = 60 days, ×60 = 3600 days; ×60 = 216,000 days,
approximately 600 years o of 360-day cycles; ×60 = 12,960 days
(approximately 36000 years); and ×60 again = 777,600 days (2,160 years—
the approximate length of an AEON (one zodiacal transition) on the
Precession Cycle of 25,920 years).
Note the obvious symmetry of the above numbers extending both
backward and forward in time scale fractals. Therefore, we can think of the
“now” or “to-day” as the center or still-point with each wave expansion
fractal extending as 60× or 1/60×: 0 (Now): 60× and 1/60×; 3600× and
1/3600×; 216,000× and 1/216,000×; 12,960,000× and 1/12,960,000×; and
777,600,000× and 1/777,600,000×. A full 30 days equals 2592000 seconds.
This same number 25920, is the number of years in the great cycle of the
precession of the equinox.
Figure 158: The past and future intertwined like waves or a double helix creating nodes where the
present exist.
 
There appears to be an Oscillation between numbers 15 and 24
(both with digital root values = 6). Number 15 (54,000 compass seconds)
and 24 (86,400 compass seconds; also the number of seconds in one day, =
diameter of the sun in miles/10, the same diameter of Jupiter in miles). The
Great Pyramid slope angle (51.84° = 7.2^2) shows up prominently as well
in regards to its compass value: 186,624 seconds = 4322 and light speed in
miles/second. Note that 54,000 is 0.625 of 86,400 and 86,400/54,000 = 1.6.
Both 0.625 and 1.6 are the boundary conditions of Fibonacci (phi
Numbers).
All of the prominent compass positions are digital roots reducing to
9, and the majority of which are prominent Hertz frequencies in

Pythagorean just tuning. Note the prominent compass segmentations and
the musical note chart include the following: 54,

108, 216, 324, 432, 648, 864, 5184, to list a few. These numbers are all
fundamental to the compass measurement of time.
One thing is definitely clear; the compass is the perfect instrument
to measure time and space. The complexity of understanding (of multiple
disciplines) and the distillation down to incredibly beautiful simplicity is
truly astounding. The system also clearly integrates light speed and
consciousness in an interconnected web of observation. Time, in fact, is a
fractal of our own consciousness.
The Golden Angle can be calculated from the following equation: 
, where γ  is the Euler-Mascheroni constant equal to
0.57721… Now, 137.5°/360°= 0.381; and by adding 1 to this value =
1.381..., we get the approximate age of the universe, being 1.381×1010 years
old.
The Gravitational Constant G = 6.67408×10-11 [m3 kg-1 s-2] relates to
all time numbers very intimately as follows: G/86,400 (seconds/day) =
(π0.5)-1. Also, 1,440 (mins/day)/G = 216 (there are 2,160 years in an
AEON); 24 (hours/day)/G = 3.6 (360° fractal expression).
Please note all the other equations where: G/3.33 = 5.00
(Pentagon); G/6.66 = 1.00; G/3 = ( Φ ×360)/102; G/( Φ /10) = 108, the list
goes on and on. It appears that Gravity (6.67) brings order back from
disorder.
Of course, all the above results from our definition of how long a
second would take. But this definition is not arbitrary. In fact, it is
fundamentally based on distance. If we take a pendulum of length L = 1
meter, swing it under the earth's gravitation field, the time it takes the
pendulum to span 30° of arc is exactly one second. Moreover, this 30° of
arc is equal to 1 cubit. This same 30° of arc, for a circle of radius of 3960
(the radius of the earth in meter), spans 7200 seconds, the same number we
found in the deficient angles of all polyhedral.
One interesting relationship that determines the number of seconds
in a day T = 86400 (60 
× 60 
×24 
) is dependant on the
gravitational constant G = 6.674… 10-11 [m3 kg-1 s-2] and π as follows:
 

This is a very simple and elegant equation that depends only on
gravitation. It is different from the period equation of the pendulum (
 ) and more general as the latter depends on the earth’s gravity
acceleration rate g = 9.81 m/s2 while the new equation depends on the
universal constant of gravitation G.
 
Figure 159: Each 30° of arc swing of a 1-meter long pendulum is equal to 1 cubit and takes 1 second
to complete.
 
Combining the sexagesimal/compass conversions with geometry
brings out a beautiful order and symmetry. Starting from the elemental
geometry of a circle, a square, and a triangle, some of the major constants
of nature emerge, as shown below. By setting the side of the triangle to
equal π, constants emerge either in their regular or compass-conversion
values, such as e = 271828; α  = 729735; Ω  = 567143; γ  = 577215; φ  =
161803; and Δ  = 518436 (equivalent to the Great Pyramid’s slope). Most
interestingly, is that the two new numbers of phio = 366025 and siev =
63397 emerge as well as if they belong to the same league of fundamental
constants.
The sexagesimal compass, which is a fractal of the 12-base system
(60 = 5×12), works perfectly with the 9-base system to create the
fundamental constants of nature and consequently define our reality.
Through time and space, these two systems are intertwined, one visible, the
other hidden, nevertheless, working together to keep the opposing forces of

nature in an eternal balance. Whether in length, angle, or frequency, through
these two bases, all is manifested, and all is united.

 
Figure 160: Using simple geometry and sexagesimal/compass conversion, all the fundamental
constants of nature, along with the values of the new phio and siev numbers, emerge from the simple
geometry of the circle, square, and triangle.
 

Chapter 2- Matter
“Not only is the Universe stranger than we think, it is stranger than we can think.”
 
-Werner Heisenberg
 
i-                   The Atom
 
Remember when we start talking about prime numbers, we
mentioned something about the Vedic Square, the digital root of the product
table of numbers from 1 to 9. We also showed how every two numbers that
add up to 9 generated patterns that are mirror images of each other, as
shown below.
 
Figure 161: Shapes that correspond to numbers adding up to 9, as [2, 7], [1, 8], etc., are mirror
images of each other.
 
Mirror imaging is a phenomenon that is observed everywhere in
nature. Even on the tiniest scales of the atom, particles and their
antiparticles are considered mirror images of each other, differing only
through their reflected charges.  Using the digital root language, we can
compare the mirror symmetry of particles to our numbers and their
completers, generating mirrored patterns. And when a particle and its
antiparticle unite, they annihilate each other with a burst of self-mirrored
photons or energy, which is exactly what our numbers do when added to
their completers; they produce number 9, the self mirrored number. This
means that we can couple the four main elementary particles, the neutron
(n0 ), the proton (p+), the electron (e-), and the neutrino ( ν ) and their anti
counterparts, to our basic numbers of the D-space, as shown below.

(neutron ) n0   
→  1
n0 ‾   →  8
(proton ) p+ 
→  2
p-   →  7
(electron ) e-    
→  3
e+    →  6
(neutrino ) ν   
→ 4
ν ‾   → 5
 
Table 34: Coupling particles and antiparticles to the numbers of the digital root space.
 
This we already did in Part I when we linked the point-like aspect
of particles to integers. We proved the validity of this correspondence by
resorting to the most fundamental interactions of the subatomic world: the
β – decay, the β + decay, and the electron capture “K-capture” reaction,
where our numbers worked perfectly.
β – decay:  n0 → p+ + e-  +  ν ‾  and D(1) →  D(2 + 3 +  5)  =  D(10)  = 1.
β + decay:  energy + p+ →  n0  +  e+  +  ν  and D(9 + 2) = 2 →  D(1 + 6 + 
4)  =  D(11)  = 2.
K-capture: energy + p+ +  e- →  n0  +  ν  and D(9 + 2 + 3) = 5 →  D(1 +
4) = 5.
What we didn’t do back then is to illustrate how fundamentally
different our numeric scheme is from the one physicists usually use. We
illustrate this difference through another reaction.
In the so-called “Grand Unification Theory” (GUT), the proton is
expected to spontaneously decay into a positron and the neutral pion π0 (Pi
meson), which immediately decays into two photons as follows: 
p+ →  π0 + e+  → 2× γ  + e+
This reaction is completely valid in the regular numerical regime,
where we have a net +1 charge on the left side and a net +1 charge on the
right side. So, in general, there is no problem for this reaction to take place.
However, when we use our D-space numerology, we get the following
surprise: 2 → D(2×9+6) = 6.                     
Our D-space numerology is not working here. Probably because
there is one catch to this reaction; it has never been observed, even after
many years of research. Thus, it seems that our D-space numerology got it
right, while that of the regular quantum numbers got it wrong (which could

have saved physicists many years of research and tons of money on
experiments). And there is still another advantage to our numerology.
In the regular quantum numbers, the charge numbers (-1, 0, +1) can
only distinguish between negative, positive, and neutral. They do not
recognize the difference between particles with opposite charges (e.g.,
electrons and protons) and particles and

their antis (e.g., electrons and positrons), as when we add the quantum
charge numbers of these particles, we get the same zero value for both
cases. But these two cases are totally different; when an electron and
positron combine, they annihilate each other with a burst of energy, while
when an electron and a proton combine, they bond to each other, forming
either a dipole or a hydrogen atom, etc.
Our D-space regime differentiates between these cases, as when a
particle and antiparticle are combined, the result is number 9, corresponding
to pure energy. On the other hand, when an electron combines with a
proton, it gives 5, and they do not annihilate.  
It is also interesting to see how the effect number 9 has on the first
eight numbers is so similar to the effect energy has on particles, which we
summarize in the following three points:
1. When the number 9 is added to one of the eight numbers, it raises it
numerically higher, e.g., 9 + 2 = 11, which is just what energy does
to particles; it raises them into higher energetic states.
2. Adding 9 to a number will not change the digital root of the number
in the same manner energy will not change the nature of the particle;
an electron stays an electron; it just gains more energy.
3. Adding 9 to these numbers will change their parity from even to odd
and vice versa, e.g., 9 + 2 (even) = 11 (odd). Amazingly, this is very
similar to what happens in atoms, as when an electron absorbs a
photon, the electron will want to go up to a higher state. However,
the parity of this new state must be opposite to that of the original
state; odd if it is even and vice versa; otherwise, the transition is
considered prohibited with zero probability. It is like saying when an
electron absorbs energy, its parity is reversed. This parity reversal is
not restricted to electrons only but also applies to all other particles.
 
Hence, it seems that the correspondence between the nine basic
numbers and the subatomic world is almost exact. But how would numbers
do on the atomic scale? Well, it turned out they do as great.

Hydrogen Energy Shells: The Perfect D-Circle
Hydrogen is the simplest and most abundant element in nature. It is
the first element to have been created and the origin of all the others, which
are generated from the process of hydrogen fission with itself.
Made of a single proton and a single electron, hydrogen has always
been physicists’ favorite element. This is because its simplicity allowed for
exact mathematical solutions for its structure, making it the perfect choice
for testing the new theories about the physical world, especially quantum
mechanics, whose success in explaining the hydrogen spectra (the spectrum
of light emitted or absorbed by hydrogen) was one of the main motives
behind the adoption of this novel and bizarre theory.
The mental picture we all have about electrons being small beads
orbiting protons, like the planets orbit the Sun, is not that true. Electrons are
more like clouds of charge vibrating with different shapes and frequencies
around the nucleus and at different distances. In this cloud picture, electrons
are arranged within what are called energy shells, where each shell contains
a specific number of electron states. There are mainly seven shells labeled
K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, depending on their angular momentum l. The number
of electrons in these subshells follows the formula 2(2l+1), where l = 0, 1,
2, …, n-1, and n is an integer, called the principal quantum number, which
determines the energy of the electrons. This formula generates another 9-
fold repetitive sequence in the D-space, as shown in the table below, where
we have all the numbers from 1 to 9.

Moreover, their D-circle, shown below, exhibits many numerical
symmetries, including horizontal 9-symmetry along with the 3-6-9
segmentation and D-sum.
 
Figure 162: The D-circle of the hydrogen atom’s energy shells.
 
These numbers are very peculiar not only because of their D-circle,
but they are ordered such that they can produce a perfect spiral. Starting
with a line of 5-units length, we then rotate 90 degrees and draw a line of 1-
unit length, then another 90° rotation for the 6-units, and so on until we
draw the final 9-units. The emerging pattern is a simple Archimedean
spiral.
Figure 163: The numbers of the hydrogen atom’s energy shells produce a perfect spiral that starts at
number 5 and ends at number 9.
 
Could this be a coincidence? That these numbers of the hydrogen
atom, the mother of all atoms, form a beautiful perfect spiral, a 2-
dimensional vortex, matching what the Vortex Theory of atoms had
suggested years ago? Probably not, as everything we have discussed for
now supports the ether existence, even if only numerically. And if there is

one truth we learned from our research, it would be that numbers and the
physical world are but one and the same.  

ii-                The Table of Elements
 
The natural elements comprising our universe are usually found
listed in the Periodic Table of Elements, first introduced by the Russian
chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. The table, shown below, is made of 14-
18 columns that order the elements linearly, based on their atomic number
(the number of protons in the nucleus) and their chemical properties.
Figure 164: The linear table of elements where the elements are distributed based on their atomic
numbers.
 
One of the things we learned from this book is that nature is more
circular than linear, with everything, including numbers, follow the wave
principle of fractal doubling. Naturally, this principle extends to the basic
elements of matter as well. Therefore, it is logical to apply the wave
doubling universal principle to the numerical references of these elements
(i.e., their atomic numbers). By doing so, we find the elements being
separated into their proper families in a more natural and meaningful way
than they ever do through the table of elements' linear method.
As shown in the figure below, we start with hydrogen, the simplest
atom, forming the first circle of elements. This circle initiates the binary
doubling into two smaller ones, creating the first two complementary
sine/cosine waveforms, followed by four and then eight circles.
These eight circles form another two complementary sine/cosine
waves corresponding to the elements from He to Ne for one wave (sine) and
with the other wave (cosine) corresponding to elements from Ne to Ar. 

Due to its fractal nature, some elements will appear on both sides of the
wave matrix, as when one cycle finishes, an exactly similar one starts, like
an octave.
By continuing the octave doubling, elements line up perfectly in a
manner that reflects their respective families, such as Metals, Lanthanoids,
Acteonids, etc., with noble gases (the chemically inert members of the
elements) positioning themselves on both sides of the wave matrix, at the
nodes of the initial wave/circle, where everything is still and inactive. The
more we move closer toward the center of each wave's peak, the more
active and isotopic the elements become.
Each of the elements initiates a new doubling of the waves. The
carbon wave encompasses the elements of Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb, positioned at
specific points or nodes that are determined by the interference pattern. The
rest of the elements follows the same fractal doubling. The larger the atomic
number of the element is, the farther it gets in the doubling sequence, and
the more isotopes it has and the less stable it becomes.
This wave approach allows us to associate each element with a
specific frequency and shape, similar to what we did earlier on in the wave
theory of numbers. For example, In this matrix, carbon (as well as hydrogen
and silicon) occupy the central position, just like number 6 does in the wave
matrix of numbers. Thus, carbon will correspond to note C# of 540 Hz and
also to the hexagon, which is very appropriate as carbon chains usually take
the form of hexagons in organic materials.
One unexpected conclusion of the above wave-doubling
configuration concerns the existence of missing elements on the hydrogen
level (or even above) such that when doubled, it will generate the next
octave of the carbon level. By following this logic to its narrowing
conclusion, 19 extra elements (3 noble gases, 8 standard elements, and 8
isotopes) need to be added to the already known 118 ones, for a total of
137, the same number Richard Feynman, the famous American physicist,
suggested for the total number of elements (and also a well-known prime
value encoding the fine-structure constant.) These missing elements may
correspond to the subatomic particles as well as the basic elements of the
ether. Some may correspond to the pentagon, which is missing from the
above image as it correlates with gap notes, as we saw in Part III.

Whatever the nature of these suggested new elements may be, if
any, the wave doubling-based configuration introduces a novel perspective
to the elements and their families that will lead to a better understanding of
their numerical construction as well as their geometrical and acoustic
quintessence.

This unified approach is another key that is getting us closer to the goal we
initiated earlier on in the book: to gain a better understanding and decipher
the divine encryption.

their musical notes/geometry correspondences.

 
Chapter 3- The Forces: Gravity and Electromagnetism
 
“Nothing is too wonderful to be true if it be consistent with the laws of nature.”
-Michael Faraday
 
There 
are 
mainly 
two 
fundamental 
forces 
in 
nature,
electromagnetism (EM) and gravity. In the current state of physics, these
two forces are irreconcilable, being described through different
mathematical formalisms that do not share any common ground. 
In the Standard Model, the EM force is based on the exchange of
certain particles, mainly the photon, whether virtual or real. Gravitational
force, on the other hand, is described by Einstein’s General Relativity,
which proposes a geometric solution to the origin of this force, where space
and time are combined into one fabric, Spacetime, that bends and twists in
accordance to the masses of objects. Combining these two formalisms into
one unified theory has been the holy grail of physics for more than a
century but to no avail.
In this chapter, we tackle these two fundamental forces from
different perspectives, resorting to numbers and symmetry only. In the
process, a new understanding of the forces emerges that could shed light on
how they might eventually be reconciled.
 
i-                   The Basic Triplet: The Numerology of Forces
 
From the discussion of the last chapter, it is evident that the atomic
orbitals of the hydrogen-like atoms are all about the [2, 5, 8] group. And as
was mentioned before, the hydrogen atom is the origin of all atoms, not
only physically but also mathematically. This is because one can
approximate the wave functions of multi-electron atoms by writing them as
a superposition of the wave functions of the hydrogen atom. In other words,
the hydrogen atom forms the basis upon which all other atoms can be built
(just like prime numbers and figurate numbers are the basis from which all
other numbers can be generated). So, it won’t be that farfetched if we
claimed the [2, 5, 8] group to be the ruler of the whole microcosmic world
and not just the hydrogen atom.
But what about the [1, 4, 7] group? What could be standing for?

One hint comes from the so-called Titus-Bode law, which states
that the average distances of the planets of our solar system from the sun
(except for Neptune) follow an exponential curve as a function of the
planets’ sequence, as shown below.
Based on this law, in order to find the distances of the planets from
the Sun, we first start with numbers 0 then 3. The successive numbers are
then generated by doubling the ones before until we get the following
sequence: [0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384] (all having digital roots of [3, 6,
9]). After adding 4 to all of the numbers we get: [4, 7, 10, 16, 28, 52, 100,
196, 388]. Finally, dividing these numbers by 10 gives the average
distances of the planets from the Sun in astronomical units AU (earth’s
average distance from the Sun), e.g., 0.4 AU for mercury, 0.7 AU for
Venus, and so on. This law was able to predict the orbits of Ceres (the
largest asteroid in the asteroid belt) and Uranus, even before they were
discovered. Amazingly, the digital roots of these orbits form a well-ordered
sequence: [4, 7, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1] all belonging to our [1, 4, 7] group. Thus,
the planets’ distances follow a doubling principle, just like waves.
Of course, this is not solid proof that the [1, 4, 7] group is the ruler
of planets in particular and the macroscopic domain in general; however, it
is a hint that we will investigate further. And as we argued above, these two
domains, the celestial and the atomic, are ruled by the two main forces of
electricity and magnetism. Interestingly enough, it can be shown that there
exists some real correspondence between the physical and numerical
aspects; Electromagnetism with [2, 5, 8] and gravity with [1, 4, 7].  Let us
see how.

Figure 166: The above plot shows how the distances of planets from the Sun follow the
Titus-Bode law almost exactly and in an exponential fashion. Even though it deviates from the actual
values starting from Neptune, it is still an amazing accurate approximation.

Numerology: The First Correspondence
The first correspondence between these two forces and our two
groups lies in the first number of each group: 1 and 2. Physically speaking,
the gravitational force is a monopole force, which means it does not have
attractive and repulsive aspects similar to the negative and positive poles of
electric charges or between the south and north poles of magnetism. The
gravitational force is always attractive. Numerically, this monopole force
will correspond to number 1, the first monopole and non-differentiated
number. A number that exists in all other numbers, just like gravity affects
all matter.
On the other hand, the electromagnetic force is a bipolar force (e.g.,
positive and negative, north and south) that embodies the bipolarity of the
whole universe, which, numerically speaking, corresponds to number 2, the
first polar numbers. Hence, these two forces' physical aspects match the
numerical and mathematical characteristics of the first numbers of two
triplet groups.
 
Mirror Symmetry: The Second Correspondence
The first thing we have noticed about the geometrical aspects of our
two groups, the polygonal D-circles of the [1, 4, 7] and [2, 5, 8] groups, was
how the former exhibited reflection or mirror symmetries while the latter
did not. 
Interestingly, the two physical forces we are trying to relate to these two
groups have the same geometrical reflection properties. This is because, in
physics, one important property that distinguishes between forces is their
reflection or mirror symmetry.
What this means is, if we are to reflect the spatial coordinates of a
physical object (as if reflected upon a mirror) then the forces that are
emanating from or subjected upon this object, whether electricity,
magnetism, or gravity, etc. will either be reflected as a real physical object
would do in front of a mirror, or they would behave in a different manner.
For example, if the coordinates of an object subjected to the force of gravity
are reflected, the force lines will reflect in the same way as if they were real
physical objects, as shown below.

 
 
 
Figure 167: Gravitational force vectors behave properly under reflection
 
Even though the force vectors of electricity behave properly with
respect to mirror symmetry, magnetism vectors won’t. Take the situation
shown below. When a current flows in a loop, its mirror image will flow as
it should; if the original current is rotating counterclockwise on the right
side of the mirror, it will rotate clockwise on the left side.This circulating
current produces a magnetic field that flows through the loop, as shown
above to the right. However, if the mirrored loop, with the clockwise
current, were to be a real one, the generated magnetic field will not point
upward as if it is a reflection of a physical object; it will point downward
instead, in the opposite direction, as shown above, left.
Figure 168: Even though the electric force vectors reflect properly, like gravitation force, those of
magnetism don’t. Therefore the whole electromagnetic phenomenon is a pseudo-vector that doesn’t
reflect as normal vectors do.

These kinds of fields or vectors that do not transform properly
under mirror reflection are called pseudo-vectors, in contrast to real-vectors,
like electricity. Consequently, the combination of electricity and magnetism,
as in electromagnetic waves, will not observe mirror symmetry, just like the
[2, 
5, 8] 
polygonal D-circles 
didn’t 
either. 
Consequently, 
the
correspondence between the two triplet groups and the two forces has just
got stronger.
 
The Poynting Vector: The Third Correspondence
When a propagating EM wave encounters a charged particle, the
two forces of electromagnetism will work jointly on the particle, forcing it
to move in a circular or helical fashion, depending on the sign of the charge.
However, there is a third force in action here; it is the radiation pressure or
the Poynting vector.
Named after the physicist John Henry Poynting (1852-1914), the
Poynting vector measures the amount of directed energy per unit area an
EM wave carries while propagating in space. Mathematically, it is given by
the following expression S = E×H, where E and H stand for the electric and
magnetic fields, respectively. Notice that (×) is a cross-multiplication; in a
sense, we are multiplying vectors, not scalars (numbers). Hence, S itself is
also a vector, and its direction is perpendicular to the plane containing the
electric and magnetic vectors. In other words, S is directed in the same
direction of propagation of the EM wave, as shown below.
Figure 169: The Poynting vector is a real vector, meaning it reflects just like physical objects will do
in front of a mirror. Notice that if the wave to the left is reflected upon a mirror, the electric field will
reflect properly, being a real vector. However, the magnetic field will not (otherwise, the Poynting
vector would have to be also inverted). Thus the whole EM wave, as a combination, will not reflect
properly either.

The amount of pressure this directed energy can exert is given by
S/c, where c is the speed of light. This pressure is originating from the fact
that the photons, the particles of light, carry momentum with them. Thus,
when a flux of traveling photons hits a surface, it will exchange momentum
with it, which transfers into pressure, forcing the surface to move or rotate.
In fact, one idea on how spaceships may sail throughout space is based on
this effect; by providing the spaceship with big sails that are pushed by the
pressure of the radiation that comes from the Sun.
What is important to us is that we can combine both aspects, the
Poynting vector and ZPE, in one theory that may explain gravity. The basic
idea behind this theory rests on the fact that any object that exists in space
(in other words, in the ether, which is nothing but EM fields in their ZPE
states) will feel the pressure of the Poynting vector of this ZPE (just like
when an object is immersed in water will feel the pressure of water). This
fundamental pressure is what gives the effect of gravity.  
But what about our numerological correspondence? Will it make
sense in this case too?
Based on the above argument of the Poynting vector, E×H should
give us gravity. Interestingly, we get the [1, 4, 7] group form multiplying
the [2, 5, 8] with itself. This wouldn't have been that much interesting if it
wasn’t for the fact that multiplying [1, 4, 7] with itself will not generate [2,
5, 8]; it instead generates [1, 4, 7] back again, as shown below.

Table 36: Multiplying [2, 5, 8] with itself generates [1, 4, 7]. Doing the same for [1, 4, 7] group
generates [1, 4, 7] back again.
 
In addition to the above numerical agreement, all the theories that
work on unifying electromagnetism with gravity argue that gravity can be
generated or modified using electromagnetism, but not the other way round,
which is reflected in the fact that multiplying [1, 4, 7] with itself will not
generate [2, 5, 8], but it will generate [1, 4, 7] back again. This is because,
in these theories, gravity is an artifact of electromagnetism and not vice
versa.

This is similar to saying that water can generate pressure, but
pressure by itself cannot generate water.
But what could the individual numbers of each group be referring
to? What does [2, 5, 8] mean for EM, and [1, 4, 7] mean for gravity? I
believe they stand for different manifestations of these forces at different
dimensions. Moreover, fully understanding these aspects depends on
understanding the numbers themselves, which is research in the process.
Nevertheless, the correspondence between the triplet groups and these
forces is very interesting and definitely deserves to be carried further, which
we do next.
 
 

ii-                Light vs. Darkness- Electromagnetism vs. Gravitation
 
Electricity and Dark-Electricity
As we saw in the previous chapter, many properties of
electromagnetism and gravity agree with the geo-numeric aspects of the [2,
5, 8] and [1, 4, 7] triplet groups, respectively. Accepting this
correspondence provides a new perspective allowing us to make novel
discoveries that may not be obvious from an orthodox point of view. 
For example, just like every number has its own complementary
(adding up to 9), this principle will automatically apply to those concepts
represented by these numbers, being an extension to the universal law of
polarities, such as particles and antiparticles, odd and even, male and
female, etc. As shown in the figure below, every number and its
complementary create a virtual vortex, a numeric pump where energy flow
in between in a manner similar to the Yin Yang concept, which stands for
the unification between the opposite aspects of these numbers in a rotational
dynamic that blends them together in circles of complete nines.
Figure 170: Each number and its complementary creates a numeric vortex of energy, flowing
between the two numeric aspects.
 
This is similar to what we had done before when we coupled the
subatomic particles to numbers from 1 to 9. Those specific numeric
attributions were adequate to fulfill the main atomic reactions as well as to
dissatisfy those that are not observed in nature. Alternative numeric
attributions can be used as well, depending on the context they are used in.
Moreover, as we have learned from the music part, three new numbers,
phio, siev, and eno, are hidden among the original nine, completing the set
to 12. From these 12 numbers, we can create a new model for the forces and

the particles that represent them. In this model, some of the 12 numbers will
stand for forces or particles

we are already familiar with, like the electron, positron, EM, etc., while the
rest of the numbers will stand for concepts that are new to us.
As shown below, the twelve numbers are coupled to the
fundamental particles and forces, including some new ones, as well as with
the musical notes of the octave. 
In this numeric model, the main force is electricity. Static electricity
is the core property of subatomic particles, like the electron and the proton.
Magnetism and radiation require movement of the charges to manifest
themselves. On the other hand, static electricity is always there, even if the
particle is dead-still in its place; we can never deprive a charge of its
electric field. The numeric value of this force is 2, and 7 for its
complementary, the dark electricity, which represents the aspect of this
force that is hidden for us. It is the inward radiation force of gravity that
binds everything together. The particle aspects of these forces are the
photon, the particle of radiation and light, and the dark photon, the particle
of gravity, the graviton. From these two main forces, all other aspects
emanate, such as magnetism and radiation and their dark aspects.
Figure 171: The 12-base numeric system couples music notes, forces, and charge/particles to their
complementary aspects.
 
We list the twelve physical aspects in the table below, along with
their numeric and charge-polarity values, which indicate their dark/light
aspects.
Light and darkness create the boundary of what we call reality.
Think of the color of a rose; what you experience as red is only that fraction
of white light reflected back into your eyes; all other colors are absorbed
within the texture of the petals, hidden from our sight. An entity inside the
petal, let say a germ, will look at the surface of the petal and see it made of

a different color, probably all colors but red. So, what could the real color of
the rose be, red or everything else? Obviously, it is a matter of perspective.
Light is just that fraction of energy that we can see; all remaining fractions
are what we call darkness,

existing all around us. Light is the radiative force, spreading outwardly
from its source. On the other hand, the vacuum is the opposite force,
radiating inward, pulling everything to the center. It is the force of gravity.
Therefore, the dark photon could be the graviton, the hypothetical particle
responsible for the masses' attractive forces.

Table 37: Numbers and their associated physical aspects, along with their respective charges.
 
The numbers of siev and phio stand for the antiproton and the
positron, both irrational and hidden from us in most of the universe.
Nevertheless, they do appear at specific places of the universe, such as at
the center of the galaxies where the vorticular black holes manifest, which
explains their irrational numeric values.
This numerical correspondence allows us to understand the
dynamic between the different particles/forces combinations by simply
following the algebraic rules of the numbers that they correspond to. For
example, the electron, being number 3, can be found from adding graviton
to electricity. Magnetism, 5, is 2+3, which is electricity + an electron.
Electricity will force the electron to move, and a moving charge will create
a magnetic field. Magnetism (5) + electricity (2) = 7, the graviton, which
agrees with our previous discussion of the Poynting vector. Magnetism (5)
+ electron (2) = photon (8). And so on,
Similar to sound, colors also have their share of numeric
representation. As shown below, infrared will correspond to number 1; red
is number 2; orange number 3; and so on, all the way to ultraviolet of
number 9.
The new numbers of phio, siev, and eno would correspond to
hidden frequencies of sound and light, that even we may not hear nor see,
still, they are as profound as the rest of the frequencies, similar to ultraviolet
or infrared, etc.

 
Figure 172: The correspondence between the main numbers and the colors of the spectrum.
 
Transverse vs. Longitudinal: Light vs. Sound
One important aspect missing from the above correspondence is
sound. Sound is another form of waves, called longitudinal waves, which
are different from the transverse waves of light as they oscillate in the same
direction of their propagation, whereas light waves oscillate perpendicular
to their propagation’s direction. And while light can travel through the
vacuum (or the ether), sound is supposed to travel only through a non-
vacuum medium, like air. (Nevertheless, Tesla claimed it could travel
through the ether and with the speed of light.)
Transverse waves, such as light, radiation, energy, etc. form
geometrical sinusoidal waves/circles that are mainly governed by the π
constant. Longitudinal (Compression) waves, such as sound-gravitation,
form rectangular geometrical that is governed by the Euler constant (as we
showed earlier when we compared the volume of the sphere to that of the
cube).
The sound phenomenon is represented through the gravitation
aspect of the numeric correspondence. Combining these two aspects

together is not arbitrary action. On the contrary, as recently, physicists
discovered that sound waves carry mass, and they

also produce their own gravitational waves. Remember that Tesla believed
sound to travel through the ether with the speed of light. Therefore, sound,
or its particle, the phonon, could very well be the graviton. Of course, it all
depends on the frequency, and for certain frequencies, sound is able to
affect the ether to produce gravitational effects. 
Figure 173: Transverse waves (top) vs. Longitudinal waves (bottom). Transverse waves are spherical
disturbances of the medium (looking like the Greek letter Omega Ω ) that oscillate perpendicular to
their direction of propagation. Longitudinal waves are triangular compression disturbances (looking
like the letter alpha Α ) that oscillate parallel to their propagation.
 
Just like all aspects carry numerical signatures, these two forms of
waves of light and sound carry numerical signatures as well, being the
septenary numbers of [1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 6] (the wave-like reciprocal of 7),
distributed over their crusts and turfs.
These six numbers are unique not only because they emerge from
the wavy essence of 1/7, but also because they emerge from the doubling
process starting from 1, all the way to 2, 4, 8, 16 (7), and 32 (5), and back to
1 again, as shown below. The [3, 6, 9] are outside the group as doubling 3
results in 6, and doubling 6 brings 3 back again. They form a close loop
around themselves, standing for the particle aspect of the numbers, from
electron to proton to electron, ad infinitum. Number 9, the neutron, doubles
back on itself.

 
Figure 174: The doubling process of the electromagnetic pump produces numbers [1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5],
leaving [3, 6, 9] behind.
 
Notice how numbers 1 and 8, which stand for graviton/sound (dark
photon) and light (photon), are at the top of the circle, on both sides of the
neutral number 9. The process initiates from number 2, the polar number of
electricity, positive and negative, male and female, which then creates
magnetism (4), then light (8), then dark electricity (7), dark magnetism (5),
and finally gravity (1).
 
 
Figure 175: The two aspects of gravitation and radiation and their corresponding numerical values.
At the boundary, the [3, 6, 9] group belongs to both forms of energies (here depicted to resemble the
Om symbol.

The two forms of waves travel together, as shown below, with their
corresponding numeric values completing each other. Sound scalar waves
travel concealed from us, right underneath the radiation of light. As charges
progress forward in their path, creating spherical waves of electromagnetic
radiations and light, at the same time, rectangular sound waves of gravity
propagate along the same path. These sound waves, once confronted with a
mass, impart their energy in the form of gravitation. The conversion factor
between the two types of waves as they propagate simultaneously through
the vacuum is the speed of light. In mediums, such as dry air, however, they
are related via the golden section constant through the following formula: 
, where c is the speed of light 3×108 [m/s] and φ  is
0.618…
Figure 176: A propagating electron and/or proton create sound waves along with radiation waves.
 
Once they reach a solid medium, they act oppositely depending on
the medium of propagation, and thus they possess varying speed dynamics
where light, ostensibly, travels faster through the vacuum, in contrast to
sound, which travels faster through denser media like granite (6,000 m/s),
much faster than it does through 20° C of dry air (343 m/s). Opposite
manifestations but for symmetrical reasons, each to their wave nature and
parallel or perpendicular positioning vs. the wave direction. The way these
waves reconnect results in the separation manifestations of light and dark
(gravity) within the medium through which they propagate.
Thus, through the magic of numbers, we were able to create a
model for the physical universe where everything is connected and
completed. More importantly, it allowed us to give a reasonable explanation

of what gravity might be. We know that this is not the whole story, and
there are so many other factors going into the real experience

of these forces. Nevertheless, what we did is to initialize a new thinking
process that may lead to a much better understanding of the physical reality
than the current models are offering.
And with this, our numeric journey into the scientific domain has
concluded, for now at least. Much more discoveries are being made
constantly, but we felt this would be enough for an introductory book that
will explain the logic behind our endeavor towards better learning and
understanding. And to properly end the book, we conclude with a small
journey through time to illustrate the correlation our ideas have with ancient
knowledge and to emphasize that what we are doing here is nothing but a
smooth continuation, with a slight break up, of what has always been the
aim of the philosopher; to seek the true meaning behind the divine
encryption.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Part V
Art and History
“Study the science of art. Study the art of science. Develop your senses, learn how to see. Realize
that everything connects you to everything else.”
Leonardo da Vinci.
 
Most of the material presented in this book is probably new to the
reader. But how new this approach really is? Throughout its long history,
humanity always looked upon the universe through a holistic lens. All the
scientists and philosophers of the ancient world were considered polymaths,
combining a vast amount of information from various fields of science.
This, they believed, is the only way for man to attain understanding and
wisdom. Spending a lifetime studying one narrow area of a very specific
scientific field would have been considered futile, if not foolish. All the
visionaries of the renaissance and beyond were also polymaths. Newton,
Leonardo, Galileo, Tesla, etc., all knew very well that the path of
understanding should pass through all branches of knowledge, including
numbers, math, geometry, music, etc. Their methods and achievements are
a reminder for us that it is through holistic knowledge the most important
discoveries and achievements are made.
In this section, we concentrate on one polymath figure who is
known for his scientific as well as artistic supremacy. Leonardo Da Vinci’s
interests span many disciplines, including drawing, sculpting, architecture,
engineering, anatomy, etc. He personifies the real meaning behind the word
Polymath. He was also one of the best cryptographers, embedding his
drawings with many encrypted messages, some of which have already been
deciphered while the rest is still waiting, and strangely, could be connected
to the Great Pyramid. The Great Pyramid of Giza has withstood space and
time for far more than 5000 years (if not much older). This perplexing
edifice has been a constant reminder that the past is not what we would like
it to be; a steady development from hunter-gatherers to farmers, to the first
cities of Sumer, and so on. Something much bigger was there; an ancient
civilization with knowledge far ahead of anything we believed could have
existed, even of our own. They probably left us this building, among many,
to remind us of their existence as well as to tell us about their knowledge,
something we are in much need of today.

We touch briefly on this monument to shed light on a recent
enigmatic discovery that will not only alter our perspective of the
monument’s history and its builders but also help us bridge the multiple
gaps within this history and to connect the past with the present, as well as
with the future. We conclude this part with some hand-drawn geometrical
shapes by Robert E. Grant. Art is one conduit to activate the right brain and
to bring harmony to the soul. A true philosopher needs to balance both
science and art, right and left, Yin and Yang, etc., in order to achieve true
understanding. Thus concluding this part, and mostly this book, with art
creates the perfect opposite to its beginning, which was about numbers and
math, uniting brain and heart in a strong bond that fulfills their destiny and
brings them closer to the will of the one.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Chapter 1- Leonardo and the Vitruvian Man: Encryption in
Dimensions
 
“Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”
- Leonardo da Vinci
 
How much information can one image conceal?
We are all used to secrets being hidden inside images, especially in
old paintings, as painters often had subliminal messages they would like to
include in their art. Most of the time, innocent numbers like the golden
section, or even polygons like the pentagon, can be deduced from a careful
measurement of the dimensions of the paintings. In other times, however,
not so innocent hints are embedded within the many elements of the
painting; hints related to the painter, or his patronage, belief in things that
are forbidden by the authority or not accepted by the common people, e.g.,
heretic beliefs, political opinion, or even sacred knowledge that is not
intended to be divulged to the public, not yet at least.
But how about hiding most of the above, if not much more, in a
single image painted on one page of a small notebook? This is exactly what
Leonardo Da Vinci did in his famous Vitruvian man sketch, shown below.
Drawn around 1490 AD,  it is widely believed that the Vitruvian
Man depicts a man with the perfect proportions, as Leonardo would have
envisioned him. The man is enclosed within a square and a circle that seems
to define the proportion of his various elements, especially arms and legs’
span. Additionally, along the whole torso of the man and on his limbs, we
see straight lines that cut the various parts into the supposed perfect
proportions intended by Leonardo.
But is this all what Leonardo, the polymath, had intended to say, or
is there more, much more, hidden beneath the ostensibly simple sketch? Let
us find out.

 
Figure 177: The Vitruvian Man sketch, drawn in one of Leonardo's many notebooks, around 1490
AD.
 
The Pyramid in Man
Around 1490 AD, the Great Pyramid has stood on top of the Giza
plateau for more than 5000 years (some may claim it to be 10000 years, if
not more). Nevertheless, at the time Leonardo drew his man, it is supposed
that not much was known about the Great Pyramid, such as the precise
dimensions of its exterior design, let alone its interior configuration.

That been said, the idea that the exact design of this pyramid is laid down,
in perfect details, within the Vitruvian Man would be not only unexpected
but also unacceptable by orthodox historians. Still, it is there, in its precise
and perfect proportions, as shown below. 
 
Figure 178: Superimposing the Great Pyramid design on top of the Vitruvian Man reveals an
undoubted match between the various elements of the pyramid and the horizontal cut-lines that
Leonardo drew all over the figure.
 
The cut-lines we see all over the body define the precise positions
of the various elements of the Great Pyramid’s interior. From the
subterranean chamber all the way up to the Queen’s chamber, the King’s
chamber, and even the top part of the Relieving Chambers. The four shafts
that extend from the King and Queen chambers are indicated through the
intersection point the cut-lines make with the horizontal arms. The naval
line corresponds exactly with the base of the pyramid.

This leaves us with three horizontal lines in the drawing that do not
seem to correspond to any yet known feature inside the pyramids. Could
there be anything there?
These seven cut-lines are also carefully positioned to match the
seven chakras, the energy portals that are believed to control the inward-
outward flow of the body’s energy. Is this only a coincidence, or was
Leonardo hinting at something very profound about the Great Pyramid, a
monument that stands for man himself? 
In order to answer this question, we probably need to know how
did Leonardo knew about the precise design of the Great Pyramid in the
first place. Where did he get the blueprint from? Could he get it himself?
 
Leonardo in Egypt!
Most of the major events of the life of Leonardo Da Vinci are well
known and recorded. Almost all of them, as there is a period of three years
where he seems to have disappeared with no record of what happened to
him during this time. These are the years between 1482 and 1486.
However, there is one subtle clue to what might have happened
during these missing years found in a specific letter in one of Leonardo’s
notebooks and documented in a book titled the Codice Atlantico, which is a
twelve-volume encyclopedia of Leonardo’s notebooks and drawings
gathered in the 16th century by a sculptor called Pompeo Leoni. Of interest
to our investigation lies in chapter XXI, where we find a letter that gives an
account of his secret travels to Egypt working as an engineer for the
Mamluk Sultan ‘Keit Bey’. In fact, historical records tell us that during this
specific time, namely from 1468 to 1496, Egypt was ruled by the Mamluk
Sultan Sayf ad-Din Qaitbay. The two names almost match except for the
letter K, which is expected, as the letter Q refers to the Arabic letter ق
(spelled Qaf), which Latin speakers cannot pronounce correctly, so they
spell it as K instead. The letter Q is sometimes used to indicate that this is
not exactly the K but Qaf.
In this letter, Leonardo records his travel events where he mentions
going to a place called Babylon, not the one on the Euphrates in modern-
day Iraq, but the one in Egypt. This is also correct as there a fortress town
with such a name dating back to the time of the Roman occupation of
Egypt.

The title of the letter is To ‘The Devatdar of Syria, Lieutenant of
the Sacred Sultan of Babylon.’ In this letter, Leonardo frequently mentions
one Taurus Mountain that is made of limestones. Could it be encrypted
hints of the Great Pyramid?

The word Taurus could be referring to the Apis Bull, the sacred bull of the
Egyptian. Its hieroglyphic symbol depicts a bull along with a chevron
symbol. The same chevron shape can be found at the entrance of the Great
Pyramid, as shown below. 
 
Figure 179: Left: The stones that protect the entrance of the Great Pyramid from collapsing have a
chevron-like shape. Right: The same chevron shape appears in the hieroglyphic symbol of the sacred
Apis Bull.
 
I another enigmatic text, Leonardo speaks about entering a dark
place, where he had to bend first into an arch, resting on his hands and
knees, where he believed some marvelous things could be discovered.
Below is the relevant extract from the Codec:
“Unable to resist my eager desire and wanting to see the great ... of
the various and strange shapes made by formative nature, and having
wandered some distance among gloomy rocks, I came to the entrance of a
great cavern, in front of which I stood some time, astonished and unaware
of such a thing. Bending my back into an arch I rested my left hand on my
knee and held my right hand over my down-cast and contracted eye brows:
often bending first one way and then the other, to see whether I could
discover anything inside, and this being forbidden by the deep darkness
within, and after having remained there some time, two contrary emotions
arose in me, fear and desire--fear of the threatening dark cavern, desire to
see whether there were any marvelous thing within it ...”
Could this be a description of his attempt to enter the pyramid? We
may never be sure, as Leonardo was a master of encryption. Nevertheless,
the possibility of Leonardo being in Egypt around 1486 is an indicator of
his fascination with this land. And whether Leonardo performed this trip or
not, the fact remains, the Great Pyramid is definitely encrypted within the

Vitruvian Man, a strong testimony not only for Leonardo's craftsmanship
but also for the important place this great edifice held at his heart, in
particular, and at the heart of the whole renaissance in general. 

The Great Pyramid: The Alpha and Omega
The Alpha and Omega are the first and last letters of the Greek
alphabet. They were used extensively, especially in Christian art, as a
symbol for God or Jesus Christ. Its origin is traced back to the Book of
Revelations, by John of Patmos, where Jesus is supposed to have said, “I
am the Alpha and the Omega.” In Islam, two of the main names of God are
The First (Al-Awal) and the Last (Al-Akhir), Quran: (57:3).
These two letters were used extensively in the Byzantine empire,
where they were often accompanied by the letters Chi-Ro, which were
thought to stand for the name of Jesus Christ in Greek.
 
Figure 180: The Chi-Ro symbol of the Byzantine Empire is believed to stand for the name of Christ.
 
Numerically speaking, the two letters will correspond to numbers 1
and 24 (as there are 24 letters in the Greek alphabet). However, in the Greek
gematria method, the omega letter is assigned the number 800. In the digital
root sense, it is either 1 and 6 for the first method or 1 and 8 for the second,
where they complete each other to 9.
We have seen this symbol back in the geometry part, where we
compared them to the triangle and the circle, the first and last polygons. We
also saw them in the shapes of the transverse and longitudinal wave
patterns. However, to find these two specific letters engraved on the
sarcophagus inside the King chamber of the Great Pyramid, which dates to
at least 5000 years ago, long before the time of Christ, is something of great
interest.
Given the huge amount of study this object has been subjected to, it
is amazing it hasn’t been noticed until 2018 where it was discovered by
Robert Grant, one of the authors of this book. As shown below, the two
letters are clearly visible, a little bit off the scale when compared to each
other (photo by Robert Grant).

Figure 181: Capturing the Alpha-Omega engraving at the backside of the Great Pyramid’s
sarcophagus.
 
When inspected in greater detail, the engraving provides a myriad
of fundamental numerology, including numbers 5 and 6, 33, and the golden
section, as shown below.
Figure 182: Conducting a thorough measurement of the Α - Ω  symbol reveals many interesting and
symbolic numbers.
 
What could the reason behind this enigmatic engraving be? They
are definitely not intended to be Greek letters, as the Great pyramid dates

much older than the Greek civilization. Were they engraved later on? If so,
when and by whom?

Could this lead tell us something about the function of the sarcophagus?
Could Leonardo have seen this engraving on his supposed trip to Egypt?
This definitely adds another layer to the enigma surrounding the Great
Pyramid, as where most of its secrets are codified in numbers, dimension,
orientations, etc., this is the only written inscription found inside it (there
are some hieroglyphics found inside the relief chambers on top of the
King’s Chamber. But these are most probably forgeries made 150 years
ago.) Whatever the reason may be, finding these engravings, after all these
years, is definitely one of the most interesting archeological finds of this
decade.
Squaring the Circle
In Leonardo’s sketch of the Vitruvian Man, he encloses the figurine
within a square and a circle. However, he positions these two polygons in a
way that looks a bit odd. For example, he doesn’t center them around a
mutual point, but rather they are off by the distance from the groin area (the
center of the square) to the naval (the center of the circle). This odd
arrangement could be an attempt to set the dimensions of the perfect man
within geometrical limits. But as is always the case with Leonardo, there is
much more than meets the eye.
The square and the circle invite the eternal conundrum of the
ancient mathematicians, Squaring the Circle problem. This problem has
two ways of reasoning. One is to try to find a square that has the same area
as a circle (or vice versa), the other is to find a square that has the same
perimeter as a circle (or vice versa). Of course, there are no rational
solutions to this problem, in either way, due to the involvement of the
transcendental number π in both the area and perimeter of the circle.
But Leonardo doesn’t seem to have been considering squaring the
circle, not in the same line of thinking, at least. The square and the circle
could be hints to something more; extra hidden geometry that can be
revealed through these two obvious polygons.
For example, a pentagon inscribed within the circle will have its
base just touching the upper parts of the feet of the man, as shown below.

Figure 183: When placed inside the circle of the Vitruvian Man, a pentagon’s base would touch the
tip sof the toes in what looks like an intended action.
 
Drawing another circle that encircles the square while touching its
four corners creates the perfect boundaries for a hexagon such that the first
circle drawn by Leonardo will work as the hexagon’s inscribed circle, as
shown below. Therefore, the original circle and square are positioned in this
odd configuration to create the perfect limits for a hidden pentagon and
hexagon.

 
Figure 184: The hexagon and the pentagon both can be drawn within the configuration of the various
geometric elements of the Vitruvian Man, especially the square and circle.
 
Within this geometry, many interesting numbers pop out. First of
all, the radius of Leonardo’s original circle is 4.32 inches, a number we are
all familiar with its importance by now. The diameter of the larger circle is
10 inches (unity/Tetractis), while the diameter of the smaller circle is
4.32×2 = 8.64, a very important number that is related to the speed of light
(equal to 186400 miles/second), as well as being very to the ratio of e to π.
And as we mentioned before, a circle with a circumference of 432 units has
a diameter of 137.5, the golden angle.
The overall combination of these geometries in the Vitruvian Man
generates an icosahedron, as shown below. A member of the five Platonic
solids, the icosahedron was associated with water, thus life. (Interestingly,
water molecules do cluster in icosahedral configurations.) The man in
Leonardo’s sketch can then be thought of as the water bearer, the symbol
for the Aquarius constellation, the new coming age.

Figure 185: The different geometrical configurations, along with the figure itself, delineates an
icosahedron solid.
 
The power of the icosahedron stems from its hexagonal-pentagonal
configuration. It is made of 20 triangles. Every five triangles create a
pentagonal pyramid, as shown below to the right. However, from a different
perspective, its outline is clearly hexagonal, as shown below, to the left. It is
a 3-dimensional version of the Hexapentakis.
 
Figure 186: The icosahedron is a unique shape as it embodies the hexagon and the pentagon in its
configuration. It is a 3-dimensional Hexapentakis.

The Hexapentakis is the heart and mind, coming together and
unifying the two sides of the brain, bringing art, music, emotion to harmony
with science, math, and logic. It is the philosopher stone of the mind, a
monument when the macrocosm and microcosm are united and a holistic
view of the world is achieved. A moment of meaningful understanding.
 
 
Figure 187: The Hexapentakis represents the unification of the heart and the brain as well as the eyes
of Ra and Thoth.
 
Starting with the square that Leonardo drew in the Vitruvian Man,
with sides of roughly 10 inches each, we can create a fractal of nested
circles and squares embedded within each other. We can also do the same
thing, starting with the original circle of the sketch. These nested squares
and circles create a fractal matrix with dimensions that correspond to many
fundamental constants of nature.
As shown below, Davinci’s circle (in green) has a circumference of
27.143, very close to e/10. The square, on the other hand, defines a circle
that has a circumference of 31.41, which is also very close to π/10. As you
may remember, Euler number and Pi define the squareness and circularity
through their relationship with the volumes of the cube and sphere.

Uniting them together in this concealed fashion could very well be
an attempt to square the circle, but not through their areas nor their
parameters, but through the fundamental constants they are defined with.
By this unique Squaring the Circle method, Leonardo, consciously or
subconsciously, achieved the following:
Mechanistically separates light and darkness, revealing knowledge
of 
advanced 
mathematical/physics 
constants 
(including
transcendental e, π, Φ , Ω , and α  (and many more.)
Identify the mathematical connection between both transverse and
longitudinal waves (scalar/square/cubic waveforms along with
spiraling circular waves of light).
Equilibrates the universe to the light/darkness ratio of .864 to 1.00
and reveals holographic duality.
Figure 188: The square and the circle of Leonardo create fractals of squares and circles that define
many mathematical and physical constants.

Through the Vitruvian Man, Leonardo conveys the divine balance
of logos and pathos evolve into the ethos. The conscious mind merges with
the subconscious mind enabling the superconscious Heart-Mind experience.
‘The Heart-Brain.’ In short, Leonardo embodied through this masterful
encryption in art precisely what Squaring Circle is intended to represent.
As it turned out, we can square the circle, just like Leonardo did,
perfectly and using only a square and compass. The nine-step process
requires the triangle, which turns it into an alchemical transmutation
process and with the outcome being nothing but the philosopher’s stone
symbol. We start with two perpendicular lines, one horizontal, the horizon
of the earthly realm, the other vertical, representing the heavenly realm.
Together they define the point of origin, the center of perception.
 
Figure 189: Laying out the heavenly and earthly domain via two perpendicular lines, intersecting at
the point of origin.
 
From this center, we draw a circle of arbitrary units. Next, we
enclose it with a square. In the fourth step, we draw the two diameters of
the circle that run through the square's four corners, forming an X-shape. In
the fifth step, we draw an isosceles triangle that passes through the
intersection points between the diameters and the circle. From the corners
of the base of the triangle, we draw two lines that are parallel to the original
X-shape. In the seventh step, we draw two lines from the upper corners of
the square such they both meet at the center of the base of the triangle. We
now connect the intersection points between the four new lines with the
base of the triangle. Finally, in the ninth step, we complete the square, as
shown below.

Figure 190: The nine-step process of squaring the circle.
 
When this configuration is overlaid on the Vitruvian Man, the two
centers of the X-symbols coincide perfectly with the naval and groin of the
Man, which are also the two centers of the circle and the square, and with
the two hands fitting perfectly between the lines of the two Xs, as shown
below.

 
Figure 191: Overlaying the square of the circle symbol, the philosopher's stone, on top of the
Vitruvian Man, reveals perfect matchings.
 
The triangle of the above symbol is identical to another one found
in a drawing by the German alchemist Michael Maier, produced around
1618 (Phi!). Interestingly, the title of the drawing is “The production of the
Philosopher’s Stone.”  How appropriate!
 
 
Figure 192: “The production of the Philosopher’s Stone” by Michael Maier (1618).

And if the above was not enough, this same triangle is found on one
of the most controversial objects in the world, the one-dollar bill, matching
perfectly with its famous pyramid and the all-seeing eye, which also
matches perfectly with the Vitruvian Man, as when the circle of Leonardo’s
sketch made to have the same length of the pyramid, the square’s lower side
fits the base of the pyramid perfectly, and with its higher side running right
through the center of the eye, as shown below.
 
 
Figure 193: The triangle of the Philosopher’s Stone matching perfectly with the pyramid of the one-
dollar US bill as well as with the Vitruvian Man.
 
Squaring the circle has always been considered an impossible task.
Nevertheless, through Leonardo's sketch, we not only showed that it can be
done, but it can also be done by hand, using a straight edge and a compass
only. Moreover, finding the invisible triangle on the one-dollar bill, along
with the square and circle, opens the door for so many speculations not only
about the history of this bill but also about its connection with alchemy and

Leonardo, to mention a few, as whenever a great discovery is made, many
more mysteries emerge.

The Spiral of Theodorus
The spiral of Theodorus is a pattern made of adjacent right
triangles, all having one side equal to number 1, such that the hypotonus of
the previous triangle works as the side of the next, as shown below. The
hypotenuses of the triangles are all square roots of numbers 2, 3, 4, …, etc.
Superimposing Theodorus spiral on top of the Vitruvian Man
reveals a perfect match between most of the spiral lines and the sketch,
where the lines intersect with key points of the figure, such as the nose,
fingers, feats, cut-lines intersections, etc., as shown below.
The head is exactly situated between the 24th and 26th lines of the
spiral, forming a shape like a key-stone, centered exactly at the 25th line.
Numbers 2 and 5 are mirror images of each other, whether in their shapes or
in their reciprocals. It is as if Leonardo is saying one side of the brain is the
mirror image or the reverse of the other.
 
Figure 194: The Spiral of Theodorus, made of adjacent right triangles having one side equal to 1 unit.
In all the triangles, the hypotonus of the previous triangle works as a side for the next.
 
Is this simply an unbelievable coincidence? Or did Leonardo really
include all these elements, the Hexapentakis, Great Pyramid, the spiral of
Theodorus, etc., in one simple sketch? Note this is a simple sketch on one
paper in one of his many notes; it is not a full painting like the Monalisa or
the Last Supper. He must have made the full design somewhere else and
then copied to his notebook only those elements he wanted to become
visible, such as the man himself and the square and the circle, being the
keys to unlock all the hidden encryption.

 
Figure 195: Superimposing the Spiral of Theodorus on the Vitruvian Man reveals perfect matching
between most of the spiral arms and key points in the figure.
 
Leonardo’s Cube of Delos
In the music part, we mentioned the story of the people of Delos
who were asked by the priests at Delphi to double the cube of the temple of
Apollo. The solution was to double the volume, which involved the cube
root of number 2. It seems that Leonardo was also interested in this
problem, as is seen from one of his sketches, shown below.
 
Figure 196: Leonardo’s Cube of Delos sketch along with the number 126 at the center.

There are only three notes written on the page of the Vitruvian
Man: a mysterious 1A in the upper left-hand corner; a 1/14 (written in
backward mirror text)
along with a descriptive text outlining the 14 separations of man; and
number 126 (not backward) in the upper right-hand corner of the sketch
next to a clear bookmarking fold line. Of course, the answer to doubling the
cube was to increase its length from unity to 3√2 (the cube root of 2),
equaling to 1.26, which is also the new Precise Temperament tuning. Could
this be what Da Vinci was trying to tell us after all: by placing a decoy page
number next to the bookmarking fold line, possibly signifying an unfolding
to a higher octave? It could very well be, even though we may never know

Leonardo’s Flower of Life: The Singularity Convergence
As we saw earlier, the Flower of Life is one of the most sacred
symbols of antiquity. We elaborated further on its uniqueness by showing
how it can be used to solve for prime factorization, especially through the
right triangle relationship.
Leonardo’s notebooks include many pages that exhibit different
forms of this symbol, indicating how much it resonated with him. One of
these sketches, shown below, is of particular interest. Notice the
intersections of the lines for the equilateral triangle (which is also two
adjacent right triangles). Notice also the letters c, d, and e (backward and
upside-down), the numeric values of these numbers are [3, 4, 5], the same
numbers of the first Pythagorean triangle (a coincidence?).

Figure 197: A drawing of the Flower of Life found in one of Leonardo's notebooks.

This also relates to the decimal-based metrology versus the
imperial system. The base-12 system is embedded within the base-10 just as
there are 432° positions embedded within the 360°, which is probably also
why we have 1,296,000 seconds in a compass, breaking evenly into
432,000 seconds, 864,000 seconds, and 1,296,000 seconds to mark an
equilateral triangle.

characteristics of electric force, the only force of the universe, which
differentiates 
into 
electricity/magnetism, 
radiation 
(light/no
sound/transverse waves), and gravity (dark/sound compression/longitudinal
waves), as we discussed earlier. It also creates matter and spin (electron,
proton, and neutron, and their mirrored opposites: anti-particles).
Whether all the above were intended by Leonardo or not is not
what really matters. Even if very few of the above was originally in
Leonardo’s head when he drew the Vitruvian Man or the Flower of Life,
still the fact that the main elements of every scientific discipline, including
mathematics, geometry, music, or physics, can be superimposed on top of
one or two images is a strong indicator on their unity, as this

convergence of ideas and principles can only be achieved if they were to
emanate from a single source.
Figure 199: The Flower of Life symbol can be used as a blueprint for the various elements and forces
of physical reality, such as the elementary particles and the forces of electromagnetism and gravity.
 
And these types of images drawn by visionary individuals, as well
as the countless ancient buildings and edifices, are nothing but encryption
keys that, once studied with due respect and appreciation, will help us
decipher the message, which, in turn, will lead us toward the original source
of this knowledge and wisdom, to our ultimate destination, that of the
divine itself.

Chapter 2- Expanding Consciousness: Hand-Drawn
Geometrical Patterns by Robert E. Grant.
 
“Drawing is putting a line around an idea.”
-Henri Matisse
 
 
One decisive factor in becoming a polymath, having a broad
understanding of many disciplines, is balancing the two sides of the brain. It
is believed that the left side of our brains is reserved for all tasks that are
devoid of emotions, like math, intellectual thinking, rational decisions, etc.
The right side, on the other hand, is reserved for those tasks that require
feelings and artistic skills. Therefore, to have a balanced brain, we need to
work on both sides at the same time, be rational and emotional, scientific
and artistic.
One perfect way to activate the emotional side is to do art, whether
drawing, sculpting, writing, playing music, etc. Most visionary thinkers of
the past used to have excellent or outstanding artistic skills. Many were also
musicians or at least played music.
Drawing is probably the king of these right-brain skills. It
stimulates imagination and creativity, enhances eye-hand coordination, and
evokes feelings and emotions. Using colors is like playing music; for each
color, there are many tones and undertones, etc. And just like there are
many branches of science, there are also many ways and fields of drawing
and painting. Both writers of this book are accomplished artists, whether in
the art of comics creation, as is the case of Talal Ghannam, or in the art of
geometrical drawing, as it is for Robert Grant.
Becoming a comic creator requires combining many artistic skills.
One needs to be a good artist to create interesting characters. He needs to
understand emotions and how to convey them using facial and bodily
expressions. He will have to develop spatial perspectives for setting the
stages, directing the scenes, etc. Drawing animal and human figures require
some formality about their anatomy as well. And when the artist is also the
author, this entails good writing skills as well as broad imagination. All of
this will ensure the right side of the brain is fully occupied and functional.
Using the compass and straight edge to draw geometrical shapes is
by itself a challenge that requires modifying one's perception to be able to

see through all the lines and points of intersection to filter out shapes that
are not by any means obvious.

This skill is often rewarded by discovering interesting geometrical
forms that expand the consciousness and enable the discovery of novel
forms of higher dimensionality. It also entails discovering novel
mathematical solutions to problems that are thought to be very difficult or
even have none.
Below we present some of the art made by Robert E. Grant,
especially those falling in the context of this book. Through these images,
we can get a sense of elegance, as well as dimensionality, where much of
the images seem to pop out of the page as if they acquire a third dimension
that only activates through gazing. Even though most of these figures
initiate from the same hexagonal, octagonal, or higher matrix, the progress
always leads to a new shape that most of the time has never been
recognized before. And while it is not the intention of the artist, however,
each of these drawings hides a key that awaits to be discovered. It is the
duty of the gazer to look beyond the obvious and through the simple lines to
uncover the hidden, hold on to it, and unravel its secrets.

brain (rational thought, logic, mathematics, and sciences-conscious thought), and right (creative
expression, intuition, art, and music-subconscious expression) activates the neural net within the
Corpus Callosum (a broad band of nerve fibers joining the two hemispheres of the brain), Pineal and
Pituitary Glands, allowing each to fully function, operate and receive.  This balance also allows for
neural pathways to extend to the Prefrontal Cortex, where higher-order thought and philosophy (the
Love of Wisdom) develops. Just as exercising one side of our bodies only leads to atrophy and
imbalance on the other side of the body and poor athletic performance as a result, the mental athlete
knows that rhythmic balanced interchange within the brain receiver is the key to mastery.  Basic and
balanced understanding in both the sciences and arts is critical and often overlooked in today’s
reductionistic and highly specialized university curricula.  So it is with thought and universal
connection. Universal Beauty is the perfect balance of Art within Science and Science within Art.

The Spiral of Convergence: All is One
 
The flow of the ideas and discoveries presented in this book
appears to converge toward a singularity point where math, geometry,
physics, alchemy, chemistry, and sound become indistinguishable from each
other, albeit perceived from different perspectives (by each observer) as
fractional divisions of the number 1. The agents or mediums of this unity
are numbers, whether odd, even, rational, irrational, etc., along with
geometry, especially circles and triangles.
The mathematical and physical constants, in particular, are one
critical element in this cycle of convergence, emanating from each other
through simple algebraic operations as if via numerical alchemical
transmutation. One such perfect cycle starts from the one (the number 1).
From it comes the Tetractys, the triangular configuration of numbers 1, 2, 3,
and 4, adding up to 10 (which is simply 1 in the digital root sense). Their
multiplication produces the number 24, the important number that defines
prime numbers’ geometry, the Fibonacci sequence, and the Flower of Life,
to mention a few.
 
Figure 216: The Tetractys: a triangulation of dots that represent numbers from 1 to 4.
 
Number 24 has many unique characteristics; of these is its
reciprocal: 1/ 24 = 0.04166…, which can be approximated to 0.042,
identical to its mirror image. The ratio of 24 to 41.666… is 5.76… very
close to the Euler-Mascheroni constant, which also almost identical to
24×0.024. The exact value of the Euler-Mascheroni constant is 0.5772…,
and if we divide it by 42, we get 0.01374…, a fractal of the golden angle
(137.5) and one manifestation of the golden section. This particular cycle of
transmutation from number 1 to 24 to Euler-Mascheroni to 137.5, and

finally Φ  is another example of the convergence theory, which we touched
upon in the wave theory of constants, stating that
the most fundamental constants are but simple transformations of each
other, especially the golden section phi, the most probable origin of all other
constants.

The best geometrical representation of this convergence would be through
the form of a spiral, the most natural and observed form in nature, existing
on all levels and transcending scientific boundaries, from quantum
mechanics to general relativity, from the microscopic to the macroscopic.
This spiral stretches outwardly in a very careful and calculated twist that
ensures the many is still bounded toward the one, the singularity point; not
too close to collapse back into the singularity, nor too far to diverge into
unbounded infinity.
The stretching and twisting are controlled by the two main
constants of nature, the circular π, and the linear e; the former ensures the
spiral is twisting in a circular motion, providing the freedom that allows
creativity and individuality, while the latter makes sure that this freedom
remains bounded as not to lose its path away from the origin. Within its
twisting arms, all knowledge is coded in space and time, hidden beneath
layers of numbers and geometry. 
But how do we start constructing such a spiral? From prime
numbers, perhaps? Or maybe from the right triangles that define them?
What proportionalities would such a fundamental triangle have?
Maybe we should start from the most basic form of an equilateral
triangle, the one used in forming the tetrahedron and octahedron of the
Platonic solids, the same triangle emanating from 1, the Tetractys. Halving
it creates the right triangle shown below with its dimensions chosen such
that the base of the triangle will have the rational value of unity. This
translates into a value of 2 for the hypotenuse, leaving the fundamental √3
for the height.

Figure 217: Starting from an equilateral triangle of sides’ length of 2 units, we create two right
triangles of dimensions [1, √3, 2].

We can transform this fundamental equilateral triangle into a spiral using
the same logic implemented in creating the spirals of Theodorus and
Regulus. As shown below, we start from the above triangle, stacking bigger
versions of it, one next to the other, such that the side of the previous
triangle will work as the height of the next, as shown below. Note that the
ratio between the height of the triangle and its base, for all triangles, is
always √3/2. Thus, if we start from a triangle of [1, √3, 2] units, the next
one will have a hypotenuse of 4/√3, and so on.
Notice how the saw-like lines delineate a smooth spiral inside
them, and with the 12th triangle coming back perfectly horizontal, matching
up with the height of the smallest initial triangle. This is another
geometrical representation of the 12-based numeric system.              
This perfect spiral is logarithmic in nature because its dimensions
satisfy the relationship 
, where r is the radius from the center of
the spiral to any points on its arms, and α  is its rate of increase. The θ
variable is the angle, in radian, at which the spiral turns, which for our case
is equal to π/6 (30°). Therefore, we got both our fundamental constants e
and π ruling the shape of this spiral and controlling its expansion, as they
should.
 
 
Figure 218: Using equilateral triangles as a grid to create a perfect logarithmic spiral, guided by their
halves, the right triangles.

The number e can also be found within the dimensions of
rectangles that enclose the spiral. From the image shown below, we see how
a rectangle that touches the curvature of the spiral at its four sides has
dimensions of 
 and 
. Notice that 
 is simply 0.42.
 
 
Figure 219: The Euler number, emerging from the dimensions of rectangles touching the curvature
on all sides.
 
The golden section is embedded within this logarithmic spiral as
well, emerging from those rectangles having two parallel sides touching the
curvatures of the spiral, with the other two sides matching the bases of the
triangles, as shown below to the right. Note that these rectangles are not
golden spirals, as the two sides' ratio is not Φ  but Φ 2. Thus, Phi emerges
from combining the linear and circular aspects of the spiral; form the
merger of e and π.
Figure 220: Drawing rectangles such there two sides touch the spiral and the other two sides
matching the bases of the triangles results in dimensions that exhibit the golden section.

Even the new numbers of phio and siev can be found embedded
within the turns and twists of this amazing spiral through the ratios of a
rectangle whose one side touches the curvature of the spiral and the other
three matching the bases of the triangles, as shown below.
 
Figure 221: The New numbers of phio and siev emerging from the dimensions of rectangles having
three sides matching the bases of the triangles and one side touching the curvature of the spiral.
 
Other fundamental numbers can be found as well. For example, if
we start with a unit value of 1 in the spiral, the 180° opposite length is
2.37037, which is 1+( α /100), with α  being the fine structure constant 137.
Its perpendicular value (preceding clockwise rotation pointing north) is the
square root of that value, which is precisely equal to Lieb's Square Ice
Constant: 1.539600...
The value of √(4/3) = 1.1547... is the ratio of the base to the height
of the triangles, and it governs how each new triangle grows from the
previous one. It acts like another Euler number in logarithmic expansions
and accounts for each expansion precisely at 30° arc intervals around a
circle. The natural log can land at the same locations as the log based on
(√(4/3)), but uses base 12 expansion values to achieve the same. For
example, e0.4315 = [√(4/3)]3, both landing at 1.539600… (which is also Lieb's
square ice constant to infinite accuracy). Notice how 0.4315… is very close
to the fundamental 432 Hz of Pythagorean tuning. And as we showed
earlier, 432 emanates from the 12-based system as 432/1.2 = 360, which is
the angular value of the 10-based system.

Now, if we subtract 1 from the value of 1.5396007…, we get
remarkably close to the Planck Time constant, being the amount of time
required for light's wave perturbation to traverse one Planck Length
(0.539×10-43 seconds), which is even more interesting when we consider
that the corresponding horizontal axis of the spiral is 2.37037, being the
inverse of the fine structure constant that defines the separation of light
from the darkness. So, the vertical axis shows a relationship to time, and
therefore scalar longitudinal/compression, and the horizontal axis is a
transverse wave and a direct relationship to light.
Thus, this spiral combines scalar and transverse wave functions into
one field, which are inherent to the structure of the right triangles that
delineate the smooth circular curvature of the spiral. As we explained
earlier, scalar waves are compression/longitudinal waves of gravitation
(phonon-sound, which waves carry mass), and transverse waves are spiral
electromagnetic waves (radiative photons of light), which transverse wave
(excitation) perturbations are precisely perpendicular to the gravitational
scalar waves. The scalar structure of spacetime surrounds and interconnects
all the transverse waves of light and matter we perceive in the material
world around us, which we call the Universe. The scalar waves are always
there as set mathematical intervals that are fixed within the spacetime
structure.  Only certain ratios can be achieved with right triangles and
whole numbers. The scalar, therefore, defines the transverse and vice versa.
It is amazing how all of the above, and more, emerge from one
simple spiral generated from a simple triangle, all emanating from a single
point, the singularity point from which all numbers and knowledge diverge.
In mathematics, the singularity term refers to certain values for
which a function would become undefined or unbounded, diverging
towards infinity. Recently, the same term has been coined to describe the
hypothetical moment when artificial intelligence (AI) would reach the point
of self-awareness. Our convergence singularity is not that far from both
meanings, as it defines the moment when humanity becomes self-aware of
its potentials as well as its position in the universe, when its understanding
and knowledge will transcend the dominant materialistic perspective and
diverge into higher dimensions, ushering a transition from darkness to light.
The ancient notion of light emerging from darkness seems to be a
very prolific linguistic theme across many languages, cultures, and
religions. For example, the Sanskrit word Gu-ru means to bring light (Ru)

from darkness (Gu). From ΑχΩ  to Yin-Shen-Yang to Mer-Ka-Ba, the
deeper symbology seems to be amazingly consistent. Each appears to have
a dualistic binary construct that evolves into a trinary relationship between
syllables. In the case of the Yin-Yang, its binary iteration includes the
Chinese characters for both
the sun (Yang) and the moon (Yin). However, when Shen arrives, it
complements and evolves the word combination to a trinary relationship,
with Shen introducing the Chinese characters for both spirit and earth
(heavenly earth). Furthermore, the Ka in the ancient word Merkaba
connotes the bringing of the spirit into a union with light (Mer) and with the
body of flesh (Ba). It is the Φ  coming to fulfill the π-e relationship (π Φ e).
(Notice the circular and linear aspects of the Phi letter.)
 
Figure 222: The Shen symbol representing the unity of the trinary aspects of the sun, moon, and
earth.
 
In Plato's Timaeus, it is explained that the two bands that form 'the
soul of the world' cross each other like the letter χ  (chi). Plato's analogy
brings an expanded view to the early Christian meaning of ΑχΩ .  In the
Egyptian pantheon, the sun god Ra is merged with the left eye of Horus,
creating Ra-Horakhty, a deity often symbolized by the flying sun disk and

possessing powers of the two prior divine emanations. It is quite astounding
that the respective mythologies (of very disparate lands and teachings), their
various spiritual symbols, and even the differing (or very similar) phonetics
all seem to possess

similar root cognates, characteristics, and philosophies, and importantly,
also seem to be pointing to a convergence of unity and balance that goes
beyond and transcends the very concept of duality itself.
In terms of simple numerals, the above trinary principle will correspond to
numbers [0, 0.999…, 1]. Numbers 1 and 0 are the polar aspects of our
modern era. They are the binary representation of the digital age we are all
living and experiencing to its maximum, where the internet and social
platforms have transformed our lives through the information revolution.
Unfortunately, though, this binary approach has produced many negative
aspects alongside the positive ones. By dint of the above, a third element is
needed to restore the balance. The eno number of (0.9999…) corresponds to
this third element, where it stands for the hidden aspects of the soul or spirit
that we need to bring back into the abstract and mundane digital age for our
lives to have a greater meaning again. It is the number between 1 and 0 that
combines both aspects, 1 in its approximated value and zero in its digital
root; it is the superposition value of the quantum computing age of 1, 0, and
x.
But should this quantum revolution bring light with it or more
darkness?
It is up to us to decide, as has always been the case. Quantum
computing will definitely bring so much advancement to all fields of
science; however, it will also bring lots of risks, which include rendering
much of current encryption systems vulnerable if not useless. This will
either usher in an age of chaos or an age of better encryption as well as
better privacy and sovereignty over our own personal data, especially our
DNA. The convergence methodology is definitely the right step towards
such sovereignty. It is an already overdue new renaissance that should
spiral humanity into awareness and control and towards a better future for
the whole Earth. This is achieved by keeping the spiral tethered to its origin,
to Φ , bringing both π and e, left and right, advancements and morality, into
a perfect balance, which was the intention of this book from the beginning.
And while we do not claim we covered everything in the book, nor that
everything we covered is 100% true, we are confident we made the right
step, hoping it was at the right moment, which only time would tell.
