Abstract: Water distribution networks are vital hydraulic infrastructures, essential for providing
consumers with sufﬁcient water of appropriate quality. The cost of construction, operation, and
maintenance of such networks is extremely large. The problem of optimization of a water distribution
network is governed by the type of water distribution network and the size of pipelines placed in the
distribution network. This problem of optimal diameter allocation of pipes in a distribution network
has been heavily researched over the past few decades. This study describes the development of
an algorithm, ‘Smart Optimization Program for Water Distribution Networks’ (SOP–WDN), which
applies genetic algorithm to the problem of the least-cost design of water distribution networks.
SOP–WDN demonstrates the application of an evolutionary optimization technique, i.e., genetic
algorithm, linked with a hydraulic simulation solver EPANET, for the optimal design of water
distribution networks. The developed algorithm was applied to three benchmark water distribution
network optimization problems and produced consistently good results. SOP–WDN can be utilized
as a tool for guiding engineers during the design and rehabilitation of water distribution pipelines.
Keywords: water distribution networks; optimization; genetic algorithm; EPANET
1. Introduction
A water distribution network (WDN) is comprised of various elements, such as
reservoirs, pumps, pipes, tanks, and valves. Around 80% of the total cost of a water supply
project is invested in its water distribution system [1]. Hence, the design of a cost-effective
and reliable water distribution network is a must. Optimization of the WDN involves
the design of a reliable, efﬁcient, and cost-effective distribution network that fulﬁls the
necessary water demands, while maintaining adequate pressure heads.
This is crucial for conservation of water resources, as well as for reducing energy
requirements and maintenance costs. Optimization of WDNs can be categorized into many
types, viz. design, operation, calibration, level-of-service, monitoring system and network
testing. This paper deals with determining the optimal diameters of pipelines in a water
distribution network with a predetermined layout.
Background and Related Work
Over the years, numerous researchers have presented many different methods for
obtaining the optimal solution to the pipe network optimization problem. The Hardy cross
method is considered as the oldest method for solving a pipe network. In this method,
at any pipe junction, the algebraic sum of ﬂow must be zero, and the algebraic sum of
pressure drops at any loop must also be zero [2]. This method was improved upon by
many other researchers. Alperovits and Shamir [3] proposed one of the most signiﬁcant
approaches for solving the problem of water distribution network design by utilizing the
successive Linear Programming Gradient (LPG) method. This method was adopted and
further expanded upon by other researchers [4,5].

However, deterministic methods, such as linear programming and non-linear pro-
gramming, presented drawbacks, such as entrapment in local minima, and dependence
on the starting point. Hence, they failed to obtain near optimal solutions for complex,
multi-objective, real-world pipe network problems. It is crucial to escape local minima [6]
and to overcome these drawbacks, researchers began to utilize meta-heuristic algorithms
(genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, etc.) for water network design problems. These
techniques include algorithms having some stochastic components. Goldberg and Kuo
introduced stochastic methods for the optimization of water distribution networks using
the principles of natural selection and genetics [7]. Simpson et al. used simple genetic
algorithms (GA), and obtained a near optimal solution [8], while Simpson et al. [9] com-
pared the GA technique with other methods, such as complete enumeration and non-linear
optimization, and concluded that the GA technique generates multiple alternative solutions
that are both practical and close to the optimum. The results obtained by Simpson et al. [8]
were further improved upon by Dandy et al. [10] using the concept of variable power
scaling of the ﬁtness function, an adjacency mutation operator, and gray codes. Savic and
Walters developed the computer model GANET [11] that utilizes GA for the least-cost
design of pipe networks.
To avoid unfeasible solutions due to the violation of constraints, a penalty factor is
necessary during the selection process of GA. Deb and Agrawal [12] developed a niched-
penalty method to more effectively solve constrained optimization problems using GAs.
Wu and Simpson [13] demonstrated signiﬁcant improvements in efﬁciency and robustness
for single-objective optimization utilizing a boundary search method. Liong and Atiquzza-
man used the shufﬂed complex evolution (SCE) linked with EPANET hydraulic network
solver [14] to obtain the least cost of some well-known water distribution networks in
the literature. SCE was demonstrated to be a potential alternative to other optimization
algorithms, due to its faster computational speed. Other algorithms, such the shufﬂed
frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA) by Eusuff [15] and the harmony search Algorithm (HS) by
Geem [16], have obtained comparable results, and have proven to be effective tools for the
optimal design of water networks.
Some studies consider a single economic objective (least-cost) to formulate the net-
work optimization and rehabilitation problem, whereas others consider a multi-objective
optimization approach that compares interesting trade-offs (e.g., a slight pressure deﬁcit
can sometimes be outweighed by substantial cost reduction) [17]. To improve network relia-
bility, Chandramouli and Malleswararao [18] used fuzzy logic based on the excess pressure
available at demand nodes. Jin et al. analyzed additional objectives, such as considering
both pressure and velocity violations [19]. Prasad and Park utilized genetic algorithms and
considered both minimization of cost and maximization of network reliability [20]. More
recent developments include improving algorithm convergence by using an engineered
initial population, rather than a random one [21]; improvement of computational efﬁciency
via the reduction of search space [22]; combining GA and mathematical programming with
the inclusion of new elements such as pressure reducing valves [23]; using artiﬁcial neural
networks (ANNs) rather than hydraulic and water quality simulation models together with
differential evolution (DE) for optimization [24]; developing the Harris hawks optimization
algorithm (HHO) for WDN optimization [25].
Additionally, Bilal and Pant utilized a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm (FA-PSO) [26]
focusing on the Hanoi distribution network. Praneeth et al. demonstrated water cycle
optimization algorithm [27], whereas Pankaj et al. utilized Cuckoo search [28] for least
cost design of benchmark distribution networks. Surco et al. utilized a modiﬁed particle
swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for the optimization of distribution networks [29].
Cassiolato et al. proposed a deterministic mathematical programming approach without
utilizing hydraulic simulators for cost minimization of looped WDNs, where generalized
disjunctive programming is used to reformulate the discrete optimization problem to a
mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem [30]. Pant and Snasel proposed
a fuzzy C-means adaptive differential evolution (FCADE) for optimizing well-known

Water 2022, 14, 851

benchmark WDN problems [31]. Bi et al. compared the searching behavior of evolutionary
algorithms on water distribution system design optimization [32]. Zhao et al. proposed
an in-sync optimization model for network layout and pipe diameter determination of
a self-pressurized drip irrigation system [33]. Shao et al. utilized genetic algorithm for
optimal placement of ﬂow meters and valves in a distribution system [34].
Moreover, many researchers have considered operational optimization of WDNs,
since minimization of operational energy costs during pumping must also be accounted for
together with the construction costs. Electricity consumption during operation is one of
the biggest marginal expenditures for water utilities [35]. Operational optimization can be
achieved by controlling times when pumps operate, also called pump scheduling [36,37],
ﬂow rates [38], pump speeds [39] and tank-water trigger levels [40]. Furthermore, other fac-
tors such as real-time control and water quality can also be considered [41–43]. Metaheuris-
tics such as GA have been abundantly utilized for operational optimization of WDNs, pri-
marily with the objective of minimizing the overall cost of the pumping operation [44–46].
Research works in optimization of WDNs have been comprehensively reviewed by Mala
et al. for design and rehabilitation [47] and system operation [35]. GA have also been
abundantly applied for optimization in multiple ﬁelds of research [48–50]. Katoch et al. [51]
have elaborated the advancements made in the ﬁeld of GA.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Problem Formulation
Cost-effective WDN design is a discrete optimization problem, as the individual pipe
sizes are to be selected from a list of available commercial size diameters. The search
space can be determined as the number of available diameters, raised to the power of
the number of pipes in the network [52]; e.g., if 8 different commercial pipe sizes are
available for the design of a WDN having 10 pipelines, the search space size would be
810, i.e., 1,073,741,824 different pipe combinations. Hence, even for a relatively small
pipe network, the search space is large. The design of an economically optimal water
distribution network is a difﬁcult task, because it involves solving many complex, non-
linear, and discontinuous hydraulic equations, while simultaneously optimizing pipe sizes
and other network components [53,54].
Optimization of a water distribution network aims to ﬁnd the optimal pipe diameters
in the network for the given layout and demand requirements. The optimal pipe sizes that
satisfy all implicit constraints (conservations of mass and energy), and explicit constraints
(hydraulic and design constraints) are selected in the ﬁnal network.
The continuity equation is given as:
n
∑
i=1
qi = 0
(1)
The continuity equation is applied to each node, with qi being the ﬂow rate (ﬂow into
and ﬂow out of the node), and n is the number of pipes connected at the node.
The energy equation is given as:
m
∑
i=1
hi = 0
(2)
The energy equation is applied to each loop in the distribution network, where hi is
the head loss in each pipe, and m is the number of pipes in the loop.
The objective function is the total cost of the given network. The total cost CT is
calculated as:
CT =
Np
∑
i=1
Ci(Di) · Li
(3)

Water 2022, 14, 851
4 of 24
where, Np is the total number of pipes, Ci(Di) is the cost per unit length of pipe i with
diameter Di, and Li is the length of pipe i. The objective function is to be minimized under
the implicit constraints and explicit constraints.
The head loss is the sum of the local head losses and the friction head losses. The
equation used to calculate the head loss is the Hazen–Williams equation. This equation is
an empirical equation that relates the ﬂow of water in a pipe with the physical properties of
the pipe and the energy loss due to friction. The Hazen–Williams coefﬁcient, abbreviated
as C, is a dimensionless number used in the Hazen–Williams equation [55]. The equation
can be expressed as:
h f = 4.72C−1.85Q1.85D−4.87L
(4)
where, h f is the head loss, Q is the ﬂow rate, C is the Hazen–Williams coefﬁcient, D is the
pipe inside diameter, and L is the pipe length.
2.2. Genetic Algorithm
A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm based on the mechanics of natural se-
lection and natural genetics [56]. Although stochastic at certain aspects, a genetic algorithm
is not entirely random, as it utilizes historical information to determine new search points.
GAs have been widely utilized to solve optimization problems in multiple ﬁelds [57]. Fol-
lowing the concept of ‘survival of the ﬁttest’, improvements in solutions evolve from past
generations, until a near optimal solution is obtained. In genetic algorithms, the candidate
solutions are represented by chromosomes (e.g., binary strings), and are collectively known
as the population. The chromosomes are then evolved in each subsequent generation,
according to their ﬁtness. The ﬁtness evaluation of each candidate solution depends upon
how well it the meets the requirements of a pre-deﬁned objective function (e.g., lowest cost).
The more ﬁt the candidate solution, the greater probability it will have of being selected for
reproduction. Hence, the more ﬁt chromosomes replace the less ﬁt chromosomes, and the
process continues until a near optimal solution is found.
The general idea of GA in a pipe network optimization problem is to select a population
of initial solution points, scattered randomly in the optimization space, and then converge
iteratively to better solutions, until the desired criteria for stopping are achieved. The steps
for using GA for pipe network optimization can be brieﬂy described as follows [8]:
1.
Generation of initial population
The GA randomly generates an initial population of coded strings (binary) represent-
ing pipe network solutions of population size N. Each of the N strings represents a possible
combination of pipe sizes.
2.
Computation of network cost
For each N string in the population, the GA decodes each substring into the corresponding
pipe size and computes the total network cost (material cost, construction cost, etc.).
3
Hydraulic analysis of each network
A steady state hydraulic network solver computes the heads and discharges under
the speciﬁed demand patterns for each of the network designs in the population. The
actual nodal pressures are compared with the minimum allowable pressure heads, and any
pressure deﬁcits are noted. Similarly, the actual water velocities at pipes are compared with
the desired velocity of the water distribution network and any deviation in velocity are
also noted.
4.
Computation of penalty cost
The GA assigns a penalty cost for each individual network design in the population if
a pipe network does not satisfy the pressure and velocity constraints (for example, pressure
violation at a particular node if the pressure in the node is less than or greater than the
desired pressure).

Water 2022, 14, 851
5 of 24
5.
Computation of total network cost
The total cost of each network in the current population is then taken as the sum of
the network cost (Step 2) and the penalty cost (Step 4).
6.
Computation of the ﬁtness
The ﬁtness of the coded string is taken as some function of the total network cost. For
each proposed pipe network in the current population, ﬁtness can be computed as the
inverse or the negative value of the total network cost (Step 5).
7.
Generation of a new population using the selection operator
The GA generates new members for the next generation by a selection scheme that
depends on the ﬁtness of the initial members.
8.
The crossover operator
Crossover occurs with some speciﬁed probability for each pair of parent strings
selected in Step 7. A uniform type of crossover operator is commonly used to accompany
the comparatively large string size for pipe network optimization.
9.
The mutation operator
Mutation occurs with some speciﬁed probability of mutation for each bit in the strings
that have undergone crossover. The purpose of the mutation operator is to maintain genetic
diversity from one generation of a population to another.
10.
Production of successive generations
The use of the three operators described above produces a new generation of pipe
network designs using Steps 2 to 9. The GA repeats the process to generate successive
generations. The ﬁnal costs and pipe network designs are stored, and the cheaper cost
alternatives that meet the required constraints are updated.
2.3. EPANET
EPANET is a hydraulic simulator that can perform extended hydraulic and water
quality simulations for pressurized water distribution networks (Rossman, [58]). Gener-
ally, a water distribution network consists of many elements, such as pipes (links), pipe
junctions (nodes), pumps, control valves, and tanks/reservoirs. EPANET solves the water
distribution network for the ﬂow of water in each pipe, pressure at each junction, water
height in each tank, concentration of chemical species, etc. During the hydraulic analysis
of the water distribution network, EPANET solves both the conservation of mass and
energy equations.
EPANET–MATLAB Toolkit is a software for interfacing a drinking water distribution
system simulation library, EPANET, with the MATLAB technical computing language
developed by Eliades [59]. The Toolkit allows users to access EPANET and EPANET-MSX
through their shared object libraries, as well as their executables. EPANET can be called
and used through a programming interface by an external software, which can be written
in different programming languages (such as C/C++, Python, or MATLAB). Generally, a
large number of commands have to be written to achieve speciﬁc results, such as extracting
the node pressures, pipe diameters, pipe roughness coefﬁcients, or specifying demand
patterns. However, in the EPANET–MATLAB toolkit, a signiﬁcant part of the repetitive
code is already included in the toolkit functions and can be used directly.
2.4. SOP–WDN
Smart optimization program for water distribution networks (SOP–WDN) is an al-
gorithm that has been developed by Smart Water Grid (SWG) research works for water
distribution network optimization by using a genetic algorithm. The algorithm is written
in MATLAB programming language. It interfaces with EPANET-MATLAB toolkit [59]
(hydraulic solver integrated within SOP-WDN) for steady state hydraulic simulation and

Water 2022, 14, 851

solution. The algorithm imports the network layout and data from EPANET. Design pa-
rameters, such as available pipe sizes, respective cost of pipes, roughness coefﬁcient, and
required pressure and velocities for the network, are to be added. GA optimization param-
eters, such as population size, crossover probability, and mutation rate, are prerequisites
for the algorithm, and can be set by the user. Figure 1 shows a ﬂowchart of the overall
algorithm:
Figure 1. General Flowchart of the SOP–WDN.
2.4.1. Encoding Scheme, Interpretation and Redundancy
A sequence of binary numbers is used to represent a water distribution network in
SOP–WDN, as it enables a relatively extensive exploration of the search space. The coding
scheme is also simple in implementation for the given task. Reﬂected binary code (RBC) or
grey ode is utilized since it assures that two successive values differ by only one bit (binary
digit). The number of bits required to represent an individual pipe in the network depends
upon the number of available pipe diameters. The total binary sequence represents the

Water 2022, 14, 851
7 of 24
entire pipe network. An example for the process of interpretation of a water distribution
network by the algorithm is demonstrated.
Consider, a water distribution network having 1 reservoir, 1 tank, 5 demand nodes
and 6 pipelines (all 100 m in length); there are 8 available pipe sizes for this network as
shown in Table 1.

As there are 8 available pipe sizes in the example, the number of bits required to
represent each individual pipe is 3 bits (starting from 000 to 100).
Any 18-character-long binary string can, hence, represent all 6 pipelines in this
distribution network. Consider a randomly generated binary string of length 18 (exe.
101110011001000111). Since there are 6 pipes in the distribution system layout, the gen-
erated binary string of length 18 can be divided into six binary strings, each a length of
3 bits. Each binary string of 3 bits then represents a unique pipe size and the position of
that binary string represents the position of the pipe in the overall network layout. The
resulting pipe network and its respective cost can be obtained as shown in Table 2 and the
network layout can be visualized as shown in Figure 2.

When a parameter belonging to a ﬁnite discrete set is encoded with binary notations,
some of the codes may become redundant. For example, consider the design of a water

Water 2022, 14, 851
8 of 24
distribution system where the number of commercially available diameters is 13. In this
case, a minimum of 4 bits are required for coding the elements of the set of diameters, and
this gives 24 = 16 discrete values. With 13 diameter options, three of the substrings become
redundant (do not represent any diameters). The challenges of dealing with redundant
binary codes have been overlooked in the literature and in published methods [60]. Saleh
and Tanyimboh proposed representing redundant codes with closed pipes of ﬁctitious
diameters and low ﬁtness values, assuming their extinction through evolution and natural
selection [61]. However, this approach was found to prematurely lose valuable genetic
information.
Alternatively, the redundant codes may be mapped to valid codes. In this case, some
diameter options will be represented more than once. The mapping options may be ﬁxed or
random. In ﬁxed mapping, the redundant codes are assigned to valid pipe diameter options
prior to optimization. Random mapping assigns the redundant codes to the valid diameter
options randomly. Tanyimboh [62] observed that, during mapping, over-representation of
the largest pipe diameter performed better than over-representation of the smallest pipe
diameter. It was also overserved that a balanced, unbiased allocation achieved good results.
SOP-WDN handles redundant mapping by linearly scaling the probability of allocation
of pipe diameters prior to optimization, where the largest pipe has 2 times the allocation
chance than the smallest.
2.4.2. Genetic Algorithm Operators
Genetic algorithms differ from conventional optimization algorithms and search pro-
cedures as they work with a coding of the solution set and not the solutions themselves [56].
GA mainly consists of four basic operators: selection, crossover, mutation and elitism and
utilizes these operators together to produce new generations.
1.
Selection
Selection is a crucial step in GA that determines whether a particular candidate will
participate in the reproduction process or not. The selection operators give preference to the
ﬁtter chromosomes (candidate solutions), allowing them to pass on their ‘genes’ (informa-
tion) to the next generation. Hence, worse chromosomes (with poor ﬁtness) get eliminated.
SOP-WDN algorithm computes ﬁtness of an individual as the reciprocal of (the total cost
times the imposed penalty). The selection operator then randomly picks chromosomes out
of the population according to ﬁtness. Roulette wheel, rank, and tournament selection are
well-known techniques for selection and are commonly utilized in the literature.
In general, the probability of selection of an individual is calculated as the ﬁtness
values of the individual divided by ﬁtness value of the population. Selection pressure is
deﬁned as the degree to which the better individuals are favored in the population; it drives
the GA into improving the ﬁtness over successive generations. In this study, power-law
based probability selection was utilized, where P(i) is the preserved probability based on
rank of the ith ranked individual (ranked based on ﬁtness) in the population a having total
of n individuals. The value of τ = 1.1∼1.2 (controlling selection pressure) was found ideal
after numerous simulations.
P(i) =
i−τ
∑n
i=1 i−τ
(5)
2.
Crossover
Crossover is a genetic operator that combines two chromosomes (parents) in order to
produce new chromosomes (children). Some common crossover techniques utilized in the
literature are one-point crossover, two-point or k-point crossover, uniform crossover, shufﬂe
crossover, three-parent crossover. In one point crossover, a crossover point is selected at
random through the length of the chromosome. Summation of genes from the ﬁrst parent,
put before crossover point and second parent after the crossover point creates the new
child. In two-point or k-point crossover, genetic material is exchanged between two or

Water 2022, 14, 851
9 of 24
more random positions along the length of chromosome. Uniform crossover operates in
individual genes of the selected chromosome, rather than on blocks.
Since GAs are problem speciﬁc, crossover is applied considering the chromosomes as
group of distribution pipelines. Here, change of any single gene in a chromosome means
changing and replacing the current pipe with another one of a different diameter. It is
preferred to alter and test many different pipe combinations when searching for the optimal
solution. After experimenting with varying crossover operators, k-point crossover was
selected as the preferred crossover method. The number of crossover points is taken as
(0.8 × Np) rounded to the nearest integer, where Np is the total number of pipelines in the
distribution system. The locations of crossover points are taken randomly. For example,
the number of crossover points for a distribution network with 6 pipes is shown in Figure 3.
The higher mixing ratio showed faster convergence. Uniform crossover also showed good
results whereas the worst results were obtained from one-point crossover. The applied
crossover probability was 85–90%.
Figure 3. k-point crossover.
3.
Mutation
After crossover, the chromosomes are subjected to mutation. Mutation prevents the
algorithm from being trapped in a local optimum (premature convergence of the GA).
It involves the modiﬁcation of the value of each ‘gene’ of a chromosome with a small
probability, called the mutation probability. Mutation plays the role of re-discovering lost
or unexplored genetic materials, as well as for maintaining genetic diversity [56]. Mutation
operators produce random changes in various chromosomes of the population.
Generally, a mutation probability of (1/l), where l is the chromosome length considered
appropriate in the literature. In this study, mutation rate was kept around (4–6)%, which
is considered higher, especially for networks with large number of pipelines, and a hill-
climbing mutation operator was applied for the ﬁnal 10% of the generations, which would
permit mutation only if it improved the quality of the solution. The mutation strategy
utilized in the study, shown in Figure 4, was bit-ﬂip mutation since it complements the
encoding scheme of the algorithm.
4.
Elitism
Elitism involves selecting a small proportion of the ﬁttest chromosomes of one genera-
tion and copying them directly into the next generation. Elitism is used to protect the ﬁttest
chromosomes from crossover and mutation. The least-cost distribution networks, without
violating any pressure and velocity constrains per generation are considered as the elite
chromosomes. The 2 best performing individuals from each generation are saved prior to
crossover and mutation for the next generation.

2.4.3. Penalty Functions
The following Equations (6) and (7) are used to calculate the penalty cost [63]. The
penalty imposed will be higher, the larger the violations of pressure and velocity from
the target values. The penalty equation for violation of pressure constraint in the water
distribution network implemented by SOP–WDN can be represented as:
PP = 1 +
Nn
∑
j=1
TP −Pj
 · PP1 +
Nn
∑
j=1
TP −Pj
 · PP2
(6)
where, Nn is the number of nodes in the network, PP the pressure penalty, Pj is the pressure
of node j, TP is the target pressure, PP1 is the pressure penalty coefﬁcient if the pressure
at the node is above the target pressure, and PP2 is the pressure penalty coefﬁcient if the
pressure at the node is below the target pressure.
The penalty equation for the violation of velocity constraint in the distribution network
implemented by SOP–WDN can be represented as:
VP = 1 +
Np
∑
i=1
|TV −Vi| · VP1 +
Np
∑
i=1
|TV −Vi| · VP2
(7)
where, Np is the number of pipes in the network, VP is the velocity penalty, Vi is the
ﬂow velocity at link i, TV is the target velocity, VP1 is the velocity penalty coefﬁcient if the
velocity at a given link is above target velocity, and VP2 is the velocity penalty coefﬁcient if
the velocity at the link is below target velocity.
2.4.4. Sensitivity Analysis
Optimal solutions are not guaranteed in evolutionary algorithms; hence, maximizing
‘near optimal’ solutions is essential [64]. Genetic algorithm parameters are user input
parameters that signiﬁcantly affect the overall performance and speed of SOP-WDN. These
parameters interact in a complex way [65] and must be tuned to obtain better solutions and
faster convergence.
A sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the most inﬂuential parameters
and to obtain the best parameter combinations for effective execution of the algorithm. The
parameters tested were:
1.
Population Size
2.
Crossover Probability
3.
Mutation Rate
4.
Velocity Penalty 1
5.
Velocity Penalty 2

6.

7.
Pressure Penalty 2
A total of 100 individual runs were performed (2000 iterations each) for any one
alteration of any one of the seven parameters. Crossover rate and mutation rate were
further tuned in combination since a proper balance between these operators is essential
to ensure global optima. In total, 10–12 different values were tested in total for any one
parameter and the value assigned per alteration was based on the literature and the
preceding results. The ﬁnal set of parameters selected, and the results obtained are given
in Table 3 and Figure 5. It is to be noted that larger population size and iterations may be
required for large water distribution networks.

3. Results and Discussion
The conventional approach when testing the functionality, validity, and efﬁciency
of a developed optimization algorithm is to choose some benchmark water distribution
network problems and obtain their solution. Benchmark WDNs have provided a common
testbed for newly developed optimization algorithms and design approaches. To prove
their signiﬁcance, the developed optimization algorithms are applied to benchmark WDN
problems and are compared to the existing algorithms. Using SOP–WDN, some benchmark
networks of the literature have been examined.
3.1. Example 1: Two-Loop Network
The two-loop network is an imaginary network introduced by Alperovitz and Shamir [3]
that consists of 8 pipelines and 7 nodes (with reservoir), all fed by gravity ﬂow from a
single reservoir with an elevation of 210 m. The layout of the two-loop network is given in
Figure 6. All pipes in the layout are 1000 m in length, and the Hazen–Williams coefﬁcient
is 130. The minimum head requirement in each node is 30 m above ground level. The

3.2. Example 2: Hanoi Network
Hanoi network, located in Vietnam, was ﬁrst presented by Fujiwara and Kang [66].
It consists of 32 nodes, 34 pipes, and 3 loops, and is fed by gravity from a reservoir with
a 100 m ﬁxed head. The layout of the Hanoi network is given in Figure 9. All pipes
available for this distribution network have a Hazen–Williams coefﬁcient C of 130. The
elevation of all nodes is 0 m, and minimum head limitation is 30 m above ground level.

The optimal cost of USD 6.081 million was obtained for Hanoi network, and the
minimum pressure constraint of 30 m was fulﬁlled for all nodes. It was observed to be the
best solution (lowest cost) without the violation of any constraints. The solution obtained
by Geem [16] has a lower cost. However, this solution failed to meet the pressure constraint
of 30 m at ﬁve nodes.
3.3. Example 3: GoYang Network
The GoYang water network is located in South Korea, and consists of 30 pipes,
22 nodes, and 9 loops. This network was ﬁrst introduced by Kim et al. [67] and is fed by
a single ﬁxed pump of 4.52 kW from a 71 m constant head reservoir. The layout of the
GoYang network is given in Figure 12. The Hazen–Williams coefﬁcient for all pipes in the
network is 100. The minimum head limitation for this network is 15 m above ground level.
The commercially available diameters for the distribution network are described below on
Table 10. The details of the distribution network have been provided in Appendix A.

4. Conclusions
In this study, the developed Genetic Algorithm based optimization algorithm SOP–
WDN was tested on three benchmark water distribution networks, and in comparison, to
the other studies, it was able to produce competitive results. EPANET software, which
was used for the hydraulic analysis and calculations of the water distribution systems is a
well-accepted and utilized software. EPANET–MATLAB toolkit enabled the SOP–WDN
algorithm to perform EPANET based calculations directly in the MATLAB environment,
which greatly improved the overall computational speed, performance, and efﬁciency of
the algorithm. Hence, the EPANET–MATLAB toolkit can prove to be an important tool that
enables the facile use of EPANET software in the MATLAB environment for many different
research purposes. SOP–WDN can be used as a reliable algorithm and can easily be
implemented and adapted to aid engineers and designers during the design process of new
water distribution networks, or the rehabilitation of existing water distribution networks.
