“How to govern large organizations in times of high uncertainty and permanent
change? To answer this pressing question, Bijan Khezri applied the ‘free energy
principle’, a radical new idea from neuroscience with the potential to revolutionize
several ﬁelds. The basic idea: Our brain is an inference engine which seeks to
minimize prediction error. Bijan has been the ﬁrst to apply this principle to
management science – with huge implications: Minimize surprise by opening up
your organization and using the collective intelligence across all boundaries. This
book is an eyeopener for every reﬂective leader.”

“More than two decades ago Nobel Laureate Douglass North suggested we live in a
non-ergodic world. And many since have suggested that organizations must operate
in an environment of discontinuous change. However, few have articulated how
ﬁrms can deal effectively with this type of environment until now. Khezri
recommends that boards and Upper Echelon executives adopt ‘Free Energy
Governance’ in which the board deviates from common governance practice and
builds ‘meta-capabilities’ that are used to develop dynamic capabilities in the
organization when and where they are needed. Khezri suggests that doing so
requires ‘learning from the future as it occurs’.
Using a term often applied to best-selling novels, ‘it is a page turner’ in which I
learned something new in every chapter! Every board member, all executives and
scholars interested in strategic leadership and governance must read this book if they
wish to remain relevant in the coming transformational decades.”

“Corporate Governance is not just a matter of legal compliance and ﬁrm
performance, but disruptive environments impose ﬁrm survival as a central
concern. 'Free-Energy Governance' is an innovative and unique contribution to the
direction and control of strategic renewal and business innovation.
Many traditional logics of corporate governance must be challenged with a fresh
perspective of top-down/bottom-up/lateral coupling of governance and operational
channels, dynamic board capabilities, and distinct models of environmental
engagement.
Dr. Khezri is a successful CEO with a long-standing board experience in
transformative international businesses. We could not ask for a better author to
initiate this new conversation in the board research community and convey its
merits to the world of board practice.”

Foreword1
This book offers a remarkable thesis for remarkable times. The times are remarkable
as we emerge from a global pandemic—that has evinced the dangers of globalization
and connectivity—with growing concerns about climate change and sustainability.
Sustainability is the key here:
This book is dedicated to ﬁrm survival in discontinuous and distributed market environments
with the unit of analysis being the sustainability of continuous strategic renewal.
The thesis is remarkable because it gracefully migrates the fundaments of self-
organization—in the life sciences—into institutional governance. To appreciate this
bold move, consider the question of a ﬁrm’s ‘purpose’:
Purpose is not so much about knowing which port you are sailing to but ‘why are you sailing
in the ﬁrst place?’
This is, of course, a vexed question, which is probably as difﬁcult to answer as
existential questions like “why am I here?”. Free Energy Governance—and the free

energy principle from which it inherits—eludes this question with a clever inversion.
Instead of asking how must a system behave to survive? It asks how do systems that
survive behave? The answer is rather deﬂationary—they survive. In other words,
their purpose just is sustainability.
This is the starting point of the free energy principle (FEP); however, the FEP
addresses its question to statistical physics. In brief, the answer is that systems which
‘survive’ are equipped with a (nonequilibrium) steady state, under which they self-
organize. They are—in virtue of their existence—self-sustaining in a particular kind
of way: this self-sustainability (a.k.a. self-assembly or autopoiesis) can be read as
garnering evidence for their own existence. This self-evidencing can be unpacked in
a number of ways, leading to a physics of sentience or ‘Bayesian mechanics’ that
shares the same foundation as quantum, statistical, and classical mechanics.
Put simply, it means that any sustainable system (will look as if it) actively
garners evidence for its own existence, through sensemaking and sentient behavior.
At this point, we move from the physics of sentience to active inference, namely, the
process theories that try to explain the behavior and choices of sentient creatures like
you and me. The ‘remarkable thesis’ is that exactly the same principles apply to any
self-sustaining system, from a virus to a vegan, from a fermion to a ﬁrm.
Free Energy Governance (FEG) unpacks the processes of active inference at three
cardinal levels to provide a ﬁrst principle account of good governance and active
exchange with a ﬁrm’s commercial and cultural eco-niche. In brief, FEG rests on
three pillars: the ﬁrst (structure) speaks to a central tenet of active inference, the form
or structure of a generative model that is used to gather, and generate, evidence for
the ﬁrm’s existence. Provided the generative model—implicit in a ﬁrm’s organiza-
tional structure—provides an apt account of its exchange with the outside
(eco-niche), it will survive. Universally, the scale-free nature of any eco-niche
requires a hierarchically (i.e., deep) generative model and the accompanying notion
of upper and lower echelons. The process of evidence gathering or sensemaking can
now be understood in terms of message passing and belief updating that is distrib-
uted over hierarchical levels—that ultimately leads to action and interaction with the
eco-niche. This is considered under the notion of cognition, by analogy with
hierarchal message passing in the brain. The ﬁnal part of the story speaks to the
enactive aspect of sensemaking, nicely summarized as:
Perceptions are partly predictions that may change reality. (Starbuck and Milliken 1988)
This brings us to capabilities, with a special emphasis on duality management. A
key duality here is the right balance between resolving uncertainty about the world in
which we operate while, at the same time, exploiting our accumulated knowledge
and inferences to bring about states of affairs that conﬁrm we exist. In ethology and
the neurosciences, these dual existential imperatives can be thought of in terms of
epistemic and pragmatic drives that underwrite information and goal-seeking behav-
ior, respectively. Under Free Energy Governance, they speak to a special kind of
openness and institutional curiosity that is grounded in a sustainable set of beliefs
about the constructed eco-niche, in which the ﬁrm operates.

Foreword

On a personal note, I really enjoyed reading this book. It was both exciting and
reassuring to see how the same fundamental ideas can be found in ﬁelds as disparate
as nonequilibrium steady-state physics and theories of governance. I can see a great
opportunity to continue joining the dots in so many directions. For example, I would
like to see how the author deals with psychopathology at an institutional level and in
a similar vein with the use of active inference to explain false inference in psychiatry
or, indeed, cancer in self-organizing cells. However, before becoming distracted by
the notions of institutional psychosis and neoplasia, there are a host of foundational
issues in institutional self-organization to consider—issues that are unpacked in an
accessible and artful way in what follows.

Foreword2
Every so often a book comes along with bold ambitions to rethink and reshape how
business ﬁrms operate. This is such a book. It seeks to completely reorient the study
and practice of corporate governance by directing attention to the fundamental task
of the board of directors—one that is largely overlooked in standard treatments of
corporate governance.
The book argues that the board’s fundamental task is to minimize surprises in a
disruptive world and foster ongoing strategic renewal, so as to ensure the survival
and prosperity of the ﬁrm. In making the case for this novel perspective on corporate
governance and strategic renewal, the book brings together the concept of dynamic
capabilities in strategic management with the scientiﬁc ‘free energy principle’,
which has as a central concern the minimization of prediction errors.
The book introduces the concept of ‘dynamic board capabilities’ and analyzes
what boards of directors need to do to minimize prediction errors by the ﬁrm. Set
against a wide swath of literature, the book impressively makes the case for a new
logic of strategic renewal in which the board of directors plays a central role.
Notably, the board must encourage the ﬁrm to learn through taking action, which
is essential in order to minimize prediction errors in a complex and uncertain world.
The board has a further responsibility to ensure that information ﬂows in a
circular fashion between the bottom and the top of the organization. Strategic
renewal then requires that the board and the ﬁrm as a whole embrace the duality
of managing in the present and in the future while learning from taking action and

promoting the ﬂow of relevant information up and down the organizational hierar-
chy. This is a demanding undertaking, but one that is critically important for scholars
to investigate further and boards of directors to put into practice.

Foreword

Preface
The FEP [free energy principle] is a mathematical formulation that explains, from ﬁrst
principles, the characteristics of biological systems that are able to resist decay and persist
over time. It rests on the idea that all biological systems instantiate a hierarchical generative
model of the world that implicitly minimises its internal entropy by minimising free energy.
[. . .]
Living systems are effectively self-evidencing—they move to maximise the evidence of
their existence. So how do they achieve this? [. . .]
This is where the FEP comes in. It asserts that all biological systems maintain their
integrity by actively reducing the disorder or dispersion (i.e., entropy) of their sensory and
physiological states by minimising their variational free energy. [. . .]
Markov blankets establish a conditional independence between internal and external
states that renders the inside open to the outside, but only in a conditional sense (i.e., the
internal states only ‘see’ the external states through the ‘veil’ of the Markov blanket). [. . .]
With Markov blankets in mind, it is fairly straightforward to show that the internal states
must—by virtue of minimising surprise—encode a probability distribution over the external
states; namely, the causes of sensory impressions on the Markov blanket. This brings us back
to free energy. Free energy is a functional (i.e., the function of a function) that describes the
probability distribution encoded by the internal states of the Markov blanket. [. . .]
In other words, free energy is a function of probabilistic beliefs, encoded by internal
states about external states (i.e., expectations about the probable causes of sensory input).
[. . .]
This means that living systems can be characterised as minimising variational free
energy, and therefore surprise, where the minimisation of variational free energy entails
the optimisation of beliefs about things beyond or behind the Markov blanket. [. . .]
It asserts that for a system to resist entropic erosion and maintain itself in a bounded set of
states (i.e., to possess a generalised homeostasis), it must instantiate a causal, statistical
model of its eco-niche relation. In other words, an organism does not just encode a model of
the world, it is a model of the world. (Ramstead et al. 2018)
Learning to actively infer will determine the ﬁrm’s competitive advantage and
survival in a discontinuous and distributed world. The more ﬂuid the boundaries
between ﬁrm and eco-niche, the more important the deﬁnition of what constitutes a
system and how non-dissipative (Markovian) boundaries preserve the ﬁrm’s integrity,
i.e., belief systems. Our interest is shifting away from pursuing deterministic truth
through clever analysis toward designing (entailing) a generative (self-organizing)
xvii

model that empowers the ﬁrm to master the shifting conditional independencies
between the known and unknown and what lies within and beyond its control.
The proposal on offer here is that the mind comes into being when self-evidencing has a
temporal thickness [models can be thicker and thinner, deeper or shallower, depending on
how far forward they predict] or counterfactual depth [how far back they postdict, that is,
whether they can capture how things might have ended up if they had acted differently].
There is no real reason for minds to exist; they appear to do so simply because existence
itself is the end-point of a process of reasoning. Consciousness, I’d contend, is nothing
grander than inference about my future. (Friston 2017; emphasis by DBK)
The rise and continuous advance of the multi-intelligence ﬁrm—embodied,
enactive, extended (Clark 2016)3, and en-cultured (Friston 2017)—leveraging
human, environmental, as well as machine-based agents—is not only exponentially
accelerating discontinuities but is, above all, challenging linear thinking. In fact,
entrenched strategy process and governance models have outstripped their shelf life.
Strategy management and governance research are in danger of getting trapped in a
mechanistically deterministic ‘local’ cause-effect centrism fossilizing Upper Eche-
lon’s perception of the world as increasingly uncertain and unpredictable. Essen-
tially, we are in search of a self-organizing mechanism to account, ex ante, for
ambiguity and uncertainty as a basis for competitive advantage and survival.
The ﬁrm is envisioned as an enactive, sophisticated, and resource-dependent
inference machine in form of a generative (learning) model. Essentially, it is a
statistical model linking in circular causality, action, perception, ﬁrm resources,
and the unknown external world. The ﬁrm is effectively the model of its self-
generated eco-niche. The model is indifferent toward reward and value functions.
But it is solely dedicated to the pursuit of one simple objective: resist entropic
dissipation by way of minimizing surprise through generative prediction error
minimization, i.e., minimizing variational free energy. In fact, resisting entropy,
with the least energy investment, is the ﬁrm’s very ﬁrst-order hyper-prior (meta-
belief). All beliefs (probability distributions upon unknown external states) ﬂow
from here.
The generative model is the ﬁrm’s control or belief system (regulator) causally
linking as well as dynamically evolving in function of principally four states:
(1) active states (action), (2) sensory states (perception), (3) internal states ( ﬁrm
resources), and (4) external states (hidden unknowns ‘out there’). Free-energy
minimization is simply the ﬁrst-order principle that knows no other purpose but to
minimize the upper bound on surprisal of the probabilistic beliefs that the ﬁrm’s
inner states (ﬁrm resources) encode upon the external state (eco-niche). The relation
between internal and external is a function of enacted boundaries expressed as
conditional dependencies between action and perception or simply a Markov blan-
ket. The ﬁrm does not have just one single blanket but many blankets as well as
blankets upon blankets.

Preface

The common understanding underlying entrenched strategy governance models,
rather erroneously, has been that action is a consequence of perception, and,
therefore, strategy must be environment-driven. In fact, action upon the ﬁrm’s
eco-niche—akin to pointing the light torch in the dark—determines perception.
Inference is enactive (Ramstead et al. 2018). The generative model itself never
encodes anything. It just expresses the circular causality among all four states. The
generative model, hence, is a model of the ﬁrm’s eco-niche. If not, it is no good
regulator, and, consequently, the ﬁrm will rather sooner than later dissipate in the
face of entropic forces.
“This implies that the relevant generative model is not ‘contained’ in any single neuron or
module, but instead embodied in the entire pattern of connection weights as distributed
across the nervous system and potentially, the body itself. This can be understood by
analogy to Ashby’s ‘good regulator theorem’ which states that every good regulator (i.e.,
a control system which maintains integrity in the face of change) must be a model of its
environment.” (Allen and Friston 2018)
Therefore, the ﬁrm’s true governance challenge is a matter of meta-governing its
generative model as an enacted, sophisticated, and resource-dependent belief sys-
tem exercising the entire organization (‘the body itself ’). In contours, we should now
start seeing a model emerging “that underwrites a form of autopoiesis” (Friston
2019), i.e., self-organization. Effectively, it is all about casting inference as optimi-
zation (mathematically, by way of gradient decent) starting with two essential
constituents: (1) a hyper-prior (which is the ﬁrm’s resistance to entropy in order to
persist) and (2) epistemic foraging and hypothesis testing (i.e., acting upon the
eco-niche to generate belief-evidencing data).
At its heart, it is a nondeterministic but probabilistic interpretation of the world,
optimizing self-organization in discontinuous environments as a matter of self-
evidencing within the ﬁrm (at and in-between every layer of the organizational
hierarchy) as well as between the ﬁrm and its eco-niche. “Because active inference
works in belief spaces, that is, on statistical manifolds [. . .], there is no need for
sampling or random searches; the optimal paths are instead evaluated by propagating
beliefs of probability distributions into the future to ﬁnd the path of least variational
free energy” (Friston et al. 2021; emphasis by DBK).
In the context of Free Energy Governance (FEG), it is critical to understand
upfront the importance of qualifying active inference as enactive, sophisticated, and
resource-dependent, effectively delineating it from more conventional (purely rep-
resentational) schemes of Bayesian inference. This distinction lays the foundation
for FEG’s triplet of structure (top-down/bottom-up coupling of governance and
operational channels), cognition (environmental enactment), and capabilities (dual-
ity management).
Analogously, it goes straight to three crucial questions: (a) How do we sample the
world in terms of beliefs? (b) How are beliefs updated and enhanced in terms of
precision, i.e., reliability? And (c) what speciﬁc internal states (i.e., ﬁrm resources in
form of cognitive capabilities) are critical to ensuring that the generative model
anticipatorily proposes actions in view of belief optimization that underwrite the
ﬁrm’s nonequilibrium steady state (NEES), i.e., the ﬁrm’s integrity and survival.
Preface
xix

Free Energy Governance’s underlying triplet of structure, cognition, and capabili-
ties constitutes the building blocks of a ﬁrm’s generative (inference) model:
(1) Structure: optimize intra-ﬁrm top-down/bottom-up connectivity. Connectivity
emerges in ﬂow and language. Bottom-up stimuli emanating from resource
markets (such as clients, technologies, suppliers and other) are only as relevant
and meaningful to resource reconﬁguration and asset allocation as clearly as
top-down predictions and prediction models are articulated, communicated, and,
above all, programmed to process bottom-up incoming signals. Most organiza-
tions are likely to struggle adapting language to an inference-centric world
(in form of the circular causality linking corporate purpose, prediction models,
predictions, bottom-up stimuli, and prediction error minimization). Conse-
quently, most ﬁrms will only sub-optimally leverage humans’ full potential in
a world that is increasingly powered by artiﬁcial intelligence (AI). More specif-
ically, governance and operational channels are not synchronized to process
signals ‘on the ﬂy’. Organizational action is time retarded. The “use of deliberate
structure to preserve the spontaneity of self-organization may be one of
humanity’s most productive assets” (Brown and Duguid 2017) and should not
be wasted.
(2) Cognition: embrace environment as enacted through relations and interactions,
constructed
in
our
brains.
Environment
does
not
objectively
(actor-
independently) exist but is revealed by the ﬁrm’s actions and perceptions that
those very actions generate. In fact, the consequences of a ﬁrm’s activity
construct its eco-niche. Neither in nature nor in business is evolution unidirec-
tionally selective. In a world where the cost of interacting is decreasing at
accelerating pace due to technological advancement and disintermediation,
discontinuities are consequently more frequent. Indeed, a hallmark of today’s
world are the exponential dynamics of the simplicity of an individual ﬁrm’s
actions and the complexity potentially arising from it at the eco-niche level. No
complicated rules of interaction are required (Camazine et al. 2001). Traditional
reinforcement learning’s reward functions get disrupted and, most likely, are
becoming counterproductive to resisting sustainably dissipative forces. There-
fore, the logic of (self-)organizing should not be centered around the maximi-
zation of pre-deﬁned rewards but surprise minimization through enactive
inference, powered by a simple ﬁrst-order principle: free-energy minimization.
(3) Capabilities: develop duality management as a dynamic board capability to
top-down empower the ﬁrm optimizing its generative model, i.e., ‘ﬂying the
plane while redesigning it’. Exploration vs. exploitation as well as ﬁnancial
(M&A/alliancing-driven growth/innovation) vs. strategic control (organic
growth/innovation), for example, are dualities that are not only interdependently
linked but that must be continuously balanced (in form of vacillation) to
optimally reconﬁgure the ﬁrm’s resources and minimize corporate entropy.
Anticipating and developing the right capabilities mix at all hierarchical
levels—including the board of directors—are essential to optimizing model
(self-)evidence, i.e., ﬁrm survival. In a discontinuous world, the logic of
xx
Preface

organizing is moving from hard to soft—from classical to quantum. The
inferring ﬁrm is constantly optimizing belief propagation as well as the updating
of beliefs (sophistication). That process of optimizing recognition densities is
only as good as the ﬁrm’s generative (‘world’) model. So, we are no longer just
interested in the actions’ consequences per se, but how the actions’ conse-
quences impact ulterior beliefs. This recursive formulation of expected free
energy “is efﬁcient because only paths that have a sufﬁciently high predictive
posterior probability need to be evaluated” (Friston et al. 2021). Without sophis-
tication (i.e., computational shortcuts), ﬁrms will struggle navigating quantum
uncertainty, eventually surrendering to the immobilizing but self-inﬂicted per-
ception that the world is uncertain and unpredictable. Re-aligning exploitation
with exploration as well as ﬁnancial with strategic control are fundamentally
matters of optimizing self-evidencing, which is maximizing model evidence by
way of minimizing variational free energy, all conditioned by Markov blankets
within and without the ﬁrm.
In physics, the world is divided into realists and anti-realists:
Behind the century-long argument over quantum mechanics is a fundamental disagreement
about the nature of reality – a disagreement which, unresolved, escalates into an argument
about the nature of science. Two questions underlie the schism.
First off, does the natural world exist independently of our minds? More precisely, does
matter have a stable set of properties in and of itself, without regard to our perceptions and
knowledge? Second, can those properties be comprehended and described by us? Can we
understand enough about the laws of nature to explain the history of our universe and predict
its future? (Smolin 2020)
Management science is equally divided along not too dissimilar fault lines. It is
best captured by Karl Weick (1977) when he states that environment “is located in
the mind of the actor and is imposed by him on experience in order to make that
experience more meaningful. It seldom dawns on organizational theorists to look for
environments inside of heads rather than outside of them.” Indeed, the rise of the
cognitive lens in strategy management and governance research has enriched our
understanding around improving the design of strategy governance processes but has
largely remained constrained by the notion that environment is something objective
‘out there’, waiting to be analyzed and adapted to.
Google, Uber, Airbnb, and Facebook, to name a few proliﬁc tech-driven busi-
ness-model disruptors, do not represent success phenomena awaiting to be deter-
ministically discovered. These immensely and sustainably successful companies are
the product of a fundamentally ‘anti-realist’ enactment of and interaction with their
respective eco-niches, powered by unique and continuously evolving sets of capa-
bilities fostering action-generated top-down/bottom-up prediction error minimiza-
tion to iteratively optimize their very generative models and implied recognition
(posterior probabilities of beliefs about their actions’ consequences). These compa-
nies ‘redesign while they ﬂy’ which is, in the words of Silicon Valley veteran Reid
Hoffmann, equivalent to “[throwing] yourself off a cliff and assemble your airplane
on the way down” (Sullivan 2016). In fact, we are more in control than we resist to
believe.
Preface

The revolutions that will matter - the big disruptions that create wealth for inventors and
anxiety for workers, or that scramble the geopolitical balance and alter human relations -
cannot be predicted based on extrapolations of past data, precisely because such revolutions
are so thoroughly disruptive. Rather, they will emerge as a result of forces that are too
complex to forecast - from the primordial soup of tinkerers and hackers and hubristic
dreamers [...] Mature, comfortable societies, dominated by people who analyze every
probability and manage every risk, should come to terms with a tomorrow that cannot be
foreseen. The future can be discovered by means of iterative, venture-backed experiments. It
cannot be predicted. (Mallaby 2022)
Blitz-scaling has been integral to the founding DNA of these super-
outperformers. They listen to and sense what wants to emerge (Scharmer 2018):
they are the enacting designers of their very eco-niche. For those companies,
strategy is rather a matter of ex post sensemaking than ex ante long-term planning.
It is a matter of survival.
Changing how you listen means that you change how you experience relationships and the
world. And if you change that, you change, well EVERYTHING. (Scharmer 2018)
The free energy principle (FEP) as a ﬁrst-order principle leads to a ‘particular
physics’ (Friston, 2019b) inspiring Free-Energy Governance’s essential principles
that govern a ﬁrm’s continuous strategic renewal in form of a ‘wholesale reinven-
tion’ (Siebel, 2019). “This view dissolves familiar dialectics between mind and
matter, self and world, and representationalism (we depict reality as it is) and
emergentism (reality comes into being through our abductive encounters with the
world)” (Friston et al. 2018; emphasis by DBK).
The principles of biocentrism (Lanza et al. 2020) serve as a meta-theory or
philosophy of science underpinning the uniﬁed account of action, perception, and
survival that FEG establishes: “any universe that could have preceded consciousness
only existed in a probability state” (Lanza et al. 2020). The principles of Theory U
(Scharmer 2018) inspire guidance for action, top-down/bottom-up, eventually mov-
ing the ﬁrm from absencing to presencing.
Free Energy Governance represents physics’ anti-realist stance, as deﬁned by
Smolin (2020). Equally, strategy management research should more explicitly fork
along (1) a realist (mechanistically deterministic) view of the world that has dom-
inated entrenched strategy governance models and (2) a probabilistic and action-
centric interpretation of the world embracing the ﬁrm as a generative model of its
eco-niche in form of enactive inference. The consequences for organizing as well as
ﬁrm performance and survival will be far-reaching once business leaders stop
approaching a quantum world, characterized by nonlocal discontinuities, with a
classical and deterministic mindset fueling the incapacitating perception of the
world as uncertain and unpredictable.
“In short, we expect to be surprised in a world that is predictably unpredicatble - and this is
the very stuff of free-energy minimization.” (Friston et al. 2018)
The universe speaks in numbers (Farmelo 2019). FEP is a mathematical

model forces it to be self-consistent and, although self-consistency is not necessarily truth,
self-inconsistency is certainly falsehood. (Abbott 2008)
I have immensely beneﬁted from the abductive ideation and mathematical heavy
lifting of Professor Karl Friston and his team at The Wellcome Trust Centre for
Neuroimaging, University College London, and beyond. It did strike me as plainly
obvious that FEP must be applied beyond living organisms to the world of
man-made organizations. I have dedicated myself to the word model in translating
FEP for the business community, eschewing the mathematics that power FEP’s
consistency and real-world applicability in neuroimaging and machine learning.
In strategy management, it is the pioneering work of Professor Constance
Helfat—speciﬁcally the cognitive lens applied to DC (Helfat and Peteraf 2015)—
that provided me with the ‘strategic management’ anchor empowering the develop-
ment of ‘new eyes’ to start building the Free Energy Governance (FEG) model.
Equally, Michael Hitt’s work on the implications related to maintaining a sustainable
balance between strategic and ﬁnancial control laid the foundation to fundamentally
redeﬁne the board’s mandate and, more speciﬁcally, establish duality management
as a dynamic board capability. Introducing FEP to strategy management is beyond
the increasingly popular trend of applying neuroscience-originated theories, con-
cepts, and techniques to management research (e.g., Ocasio 1997; Boyatzis et al.
2014; Laureiro-Martínez et al. 2015).
It is FEP’s mathematically imposed rigor that provides a self-consistent algorithm
dynamically relating in circular causality the essential building blocks for developing
a self-organizing governance model empowering ﬁrms to strive and survive in
discontinuous environments: four states (active, sensory, internal, external), one
internal-external conditional boundary (Markov blanket), and one orchestrating
ﬁrst-order principle (free energy minimization).
Though rather rudimentary and explorative at this stage, Free Energy Governance
lays the basis for future research. In fact, many vibrant topics in strategy manage-
ment—e.g., language and communication, embodied cognition, artiﬁcial intelli-
gence, and capability development—can be reformulated as a matter of optimizing
free energy minimization, i.e., surprise minimization.
We must leave the world of the known to renormalize.

Part I
Re-framing the Strategy-Governance
Conversation
The evidence suggests that we are in the midst of an evolutionary punctuation: We are
witnessing a mass extinction in the corporate world in the early decades of the 21st century.
Since 2000, 52% of the Fortune 500 companies have either been acquired, merged, or have
declared bankruptcy. It is estimated that 40 percent of the companies in existence today will
shutter their operations in the next 10 years [. . .] Merely following the trends of change is not
enough. Just like organisms facing the Great Oxidation Event, organizations need to reinvent
the way they interact with the changing world.

Chapter 1
‘Thinking Born of Curiosity, Revolt,
and Change’
Abstract Environmental complexity and velocity have been dominant moderators
in strategy and governance research. The underlying structure of environmental
change
has
become
increasingly
distributed
and
discontinuous.
The
disintermediating nature of information technologies is challenging entrenched
business models as well as logics of organizing. Centralized top-down strategy
processes are rather anti-clocked unless dynamically and generatively intertwined
in real time with bottom-up stimuli and data emanating from ﬁeld operations in
pursuit of prediction error minimization. Neither established logics of organizing nor
prevalent corporate governance models are a match for ‘wholesale digital reinven-
tion’ and continuous strategic renewal. In fact, akin to the AI evolution from a
supervised to a deep learning logic, corporate governance is challenged to evolve
from a supervised and rule-based (‘best practices’-centric) learning system to one of
unsupervised (un)learning, i.e., self-organization. To survive, the ﬁrm must be
conceived as one cross-hierarchically integrated inference machine. Organizing is
generative prediction error minimization. Strategy is redeﬁned as top-down/bottom-
up predictions processing. “The search for knowledge is not nourished by certainty:
it is nourished by a radical absence of certainty [. . .] thinking born of curiosity,
revolt, change” (Rovelli 2021).
Scholarship is best understood as conversation. There are many conversations—past
and present, cross-fertilizing or merging into one another—relevant to the cross-
disciplinary subject matter of this book: what form of hierarchical coupling (struc-
ture), ﬁrm environmental engagement (cognition), and board capabilities determine
the success of continuous strategic renewal and, hence, ﬁrm survival.
Twenty or thirty years in strategy management research is not a long period of
time. But a framework’s consistent persistency across several conversations, not least
as a meaningful metaphor (Cornelissen and Kafouros 2008), nurtures ﬁeld research
and eventually fuels or de-constructs dominant logics (Kuhn 2012). Agency, ambi-
dexterity, attention, cognitive dissonance, contingency, double-loop learning,
dynamic capabilities, enactment, information processing, microfoundations, organi-
zational sensemaking, resource dependency, and Upper Echelon, for example, are
metaphors, lenses, or part theories that have framed conversations inspiring this book.

Indeed, metaphors create “powerful insights that also become distortions, as a way of
seeing created through a metaphor becomes a way of not seeing” (Morgan 2006).
Environmental complexity and velocity have been dominant moderators in strat-
egy and governance research. Indeed, the rate of change has not only been acceler-
ating but the underlying structure of change has become increasingly distributed and
discontinuous: ‘sense of urgency’ and ‘heedful interrelating’ (Weick and Roberts
1993) are critical to survival in a world that is now commonly perceived as ‘full of
surprises’. “Multiple strategic discontinuities will occur [. . .] the periods of stability
will be short [. . .] [producing] signiﬁcant uncertainty” (Hitt 2000).
Discontinuities are fundamentally a function of the costs of interacting with the
outer world in form of generating and testing predictions. These costs continue
decreasing exponentially because of two mutually reinforcing advances: (1) acceler-
ating dis-intermediation and de-centralization powered by all-pervading connectiv-
ity and (2) exponential growth in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and speciﬁcally
predictive analytics and machine-powered deep learning, fueled by an equally
exponential growth in cheap and distributed computing power capturing and
‘mentalizing’ more and more (big and deep) data.
We are seeing a new convergence of technology vectors including elastic cloud computing,
big data, artiﬁcial intelligence, and the internet of things, the conﬂuence of which enables us
to address classes of applications that were inconceivable even 25 years ago. We can now
develop prediction engines. This is what digital transformation is all about. This is when
the fun starts. (Siebel 2019; emphasis by DBK)
As a result of these advances, the emergence of the multi-intelligence ﬁrm
manifests itself in continuously decreasing marginal costs of innovation through
high levels of automation and eventually self-organization. This trend, reinforced by
utility-centric pricing models for computing and predictive power, is setting free
more and more resources to be dedicated to growth capital. Consequently, discon-
tinuities are the new norm, while human capital is challenged to continuously re-
purpose accordingly.
However, human capital can only evolve if we understand that beneath this
explicate discontinuous world order, there is an implicate order: “movements that
at one layer appear to be random at another will be found to have a complex,
unfolding order” (Briggs and Peat 1984) such that these “representational dynamics
[rest] upon the notion of (conditional) synchronization of chaos – between internal
and external states” (Friston 2019). Effectively, we are in the business of minimizing
through our actions the “divergence between expected and true (posterior) proba-
bility over hidden states” (Friston 2019) conditioned by Markov blankets. “Uncer-
tainty is a personal matter; it is not the uncertainty but your uncertainty”
(Lindley 2014).
More speciﬁcally, the disintermediating nature of information technologies is
challenging entrenched business models as well as logics of organizing. To survive,
the ﬁrm must become one cross-hierarchically integrated inference machine that
continuously generates predictions, which are calling to be bottom-up challenged.
Organizing is generative prediction error minimization. Strategy is redeﬁned as
4

‘Thinking Born of Curiosity, Revolt, and Change’

prediction processing that is subject to (bottom-up) stimuli-based error-minimization.
More importantly, language and communication must evolve to optimize the human-
machine interface so integral to the multi-intelligence ﬁrm. Machine learning is
fundamentally a prediction challenge.
Action precedes perception. It will be demonstrated in the following sections that
sensing and sensemaking are not only two sides of the very same coin but that our
actions are the source of our perceptions and not the other way around. The need for
a strategy process model that is more learning-centric and unsupervised (‘free energy
principle’ inspired), enactivist (emphasizing environmental enactment as opposed to
adaptation), and complete (dynamically integrating the board of directors with the
rest of the organization), is challenging traditional thinking and established para-
digms in strategic management, corporate governance, and generally organizational
design.
“Our problem is to understand the changes that the organization (and the indi-
vidual) will have to make if it is to obtain the most possible human energy for
productive effort” (Argyris 1995). That’s “why the companies that will succeed are
those that not only transform a business process, or a department, but also look at
wholesale digital reinvention” (Siebel 2019). This is the essence of strategic renewal.
Fundamentally, a ﬁrm’s capability for success with continuous strategic renewal is a
function of its ability to learn as well as unlearn (Bonchek 2016) powered by
epistemic foraging in form of interactions and prediction processing.
The organization—or, more appropriately, (self-)organizing—is challenged: cen-
tralized top-down strategy processes are rather anti-clocked unless dynamically and
generatively intertwined in real time with bottom-up stimuli and data emanating
from ﬁeld operations in pursuit of prediction error minimization. Neither entrenched
logics of organizing nor prevalent corporate governance models are a match for
‘wholesale digital reinvention’ and continuous strategic renewal. In fact, akin to the
AI evolution from a supervised to a deep learning logic, corporate governance is
challenged to evolve from a supervised and rule-based (‘best practices’-centric)
learning system to one of unsupervised (un)learning, i.e., self-organization.
Top-down/bottom-up connectivity is deﬁned as a generative social ﬁeld. Firms
are called upon to “[o]pen up all four ‘channels’ of listening: Listen from what you
know, from what surprises you, from the whole, and from what you sense wants to
emerge (the emerging whole)” (Scharmer 2018). Surﬁng uncertainty is not about
avoiding uncharted domains but embracing curiosity as an information-enriching
activity continuously and generatively feeding and optimizing one’s world model,
i.e., the model of the ﬁrm and its very eco-niche:
The search for knowledge is not nourished by certainty: it is nourished by a radical absence
of certainty. Thanks to the acute awareness of our ignorance, we are open to doubt and can
continue to learn and to learn better. This has always been the strength of scientiﬁc thinking –
thinking born of curiosity, revolt, change (Rovelli 2021; emphasis by DBK).
As we embrace thinking born of curiosity, revolt, and change to successfully
exploit the very potential for value creation that discontinuous market environments
behold, we are challenged to learn from living organisms and ﬁnd inspiration in the

pursuit of self-organization. The effectiveness of governance—in terms of ﬁrm
outperformance and survival—is determined by the ﬁrm’s ability to introduce and
continuously strengthen self-organizing mechanisms. This is precisely where Free
Energy Governance opens a new conversation, inspired by FEP.

Sensing, Sensemaking, and Strategic
Renewal
Abstract Sensing and sensemaking form one unitary act and together can be
considered a non-operational (cognitive) meta-capability (or dynamic capability).
There is no sensing without sensemaking and vice versa. And there is no organiza-
tional sensemaking in the absence of a clearly deﬁned deep (existenital) corporate
purpose. Generative processes of top-down/bottom-up hypothesis testing (i.e., pre-
diction error minimization) rather than top-down heuristic simpliﬁcation are guiding
the path to navigating a discontinuous world. It is neuroscience’s predictive coding
that allows us to take management research’s strategic cognition and, more specif-
ically, the nexus of structure and cognition one step further to provide a more
complete and practice-relevant framework for applying sensing and sensemaking
in the context of strategic renewal. Effectively, sensing and sensemaking are
empowered by the circular causality of top-down knowledge structures (prediction
models, predictions, hypotheses, and guesses) and bottom-up stimuli/data stemming
from resource markets. By default, uncertainty and complexity are subjective con-
cepts but are consistently deployed in management research as objectively deter-
mined. Environmental sensing and sensemaking are non-sensical in the absence of
having set the ﬁrm’s purpose and context in the ﬁrst place. Once we deﬁne sensing,
sensemaking, and strategic renewal in form of action-centric circular causality
linking purpose, prediction models, predictions, and prediction error minimization,
a new logic of strategic renewal emerges—dynamically connecting structure (hier-
archy), cognition, and capabilities.

decision theory ‘as a complement to the rational analytical models’ (Narayanan
et al. 2011), has emerged as a distinct and growing ﬁeld. Strategy initiation and
formulation—deﬁned “as a complex activity consisting of scanning, sensemaking,
and (strategic) decision making” (Narayanan et al. 2011)—are at the heart of a ﬁrm’s
collective interpretative power emphasizing as core capabilities the timely and

accurate reading of expected environmental change and the corresponding need for
resource reconﬁguration in pursuit of adaptation.
Sensing and sensemaking form one unitary act and together can be considered a
non-operational (cognitive) meta-capability (or dynamic capability). There is no
sensing without sensemaking and vice versa. Organizational sensemaking as a
perspective1 is deeply indebted to Karl Weick and is based on the insight that
sensemaking and organizing are ‘mutually constitutive’: “I want to understand
how the conditions of interdependency associated with organizing affect how people
deal with situations where there are too many or too few meanings” (Weick 2005).
Many deﬁnitions have been applied to sensemaking: symbolic processes of
reality construction, retrospective interpretations built during interaction, bringing
meaning into existence so that continued acting is stabilized, as well as being
“sensitive to the continuing ﬂow of potentially new stories” (Weick 2005). Indeed,
“organizations exist largely in the mind, and their existence takes the form of
cognitive maps. Thus, what ties an organization together is what ties thoughts
together” (Weick and Bougon 1986).
On a more operational level, sensemaking’s very effectiveness is shaped by three
critical dimensions: (a) the clarity of a timeless corporate purpose; (b) a dissonance-
centric quest for and optimization of ﬁltering anomalies, “[a]s anomalies become
shared, sensibleness should become stronger” (Weick 1995); and (c) an enactivist
worldview, i.e., environment is not exogenously pre-determined but is enacted
through the social and action-centric construction of shared meaning. Fundamen-
tally, ﬁrm-level sensing and sensemaking—grounded in dissonance theory
(Festinger 1957)—are a social process rather than a singular activity dedicated to
detecting anomalies. “Sensing delivers an action-based grip upon the world” (Clark
2016). Action is at the center of sensing and sensemaking. “Instead of seeing
perception as the control of action, it becomes fruitful to think of action as the
control of perception” (Clark 2016).
It is critical that the environmental throughput—listening to what wants to
emerge—is neither logic- nor goal-trapped but open to nonuniformity: “As Pondy
and Mitroff [1979] argue, rather than suggesting that organizational systems be
protected ‘against environmental complexity’, we should realize that “it is precisely
the throughput of nonuniformity that preserves the differential structure of an open
system” (Scott and Davis 2007). In fact, the throughput of nonuniformity is a
measure of ﬁrm survivability. Uncertainty and surprise are not to be avoided but
to be minimized through action- and hypotheses testing-centric engagement with the
world as the underlying world model consequently and generatively gains in
informational edge.
“In real life, people do not know all of the sources of stimuli, nor do they
necessarily know how to distinguish relevant from irrelevant information. They
1“[S]ensemaking, as a particular approach to the study of organizational phenomena, has been
variously described as a “theory,” a “lens,” or a “framework”; here, we follow Weick (1995) and
use his term “sensemaking perspective” (Sandberg and Tsoukas 2015: S6).

must discover the characteristics of sources and tasks experimentally” (Starbuck and
Milliken 1988). Sensing and sensemaking are purpose-directed, generative, socially
interactive, goal-driven, dissonance-sensitive, and experimental. It is a form of
experimentation, i.e., hypotheses testing. “[T]he senses do not give us a picture of
the world directly; rather they provide evidence for checking hypotheses about what
lies before” (Taylor and Van Every 2000; quoting Gregory, R.L. 1966. Eye and
Brain: the psychology of seeing).
Purpose/goal directedness (i.e., the world model’s underlying prediction model)
is fundamental to sensing and sensemaking. Dissonance is a function of a preset goal
generating predictions and submitting those predictions to continuous error minimi-
zation. Sensemaking models are constantly adjusted through error- and deviation-
querying feedback loops—coupling top-down predictions and bottom-up stimuli in
circular causality with the sole objective of minimizing prediction errors and sur-
prise, i.e., free energy.
Thus, it makes a great difference how foregrounds, backgrounds, and adaptation levels
adjust to current stimuli and experience. Insofar as people can control these adjustments
voluntarily, they can design noticing systems that respond to changes or ignore them, that
emphasize some constituencies and deemphasize others, or that integrate many stimuli
simultaneously or concentrate on a few stimuli at a time. (Starbuck and Milliken 1988)
Fundamentally, sensemaking is about designing noticing systems. Weick himself
highlights, though unintentionally, the very weakness of his sensemaking perspec-
tive when he states that it is “best treated as a set of heuristics rather than as an
algorithm” (Weick 1995). More speciﬁcally, sensemaking perspective cannot
explain how the ‘convergence of individual cognitive cause maps’ transmorph into
the organizational cause map. In fact, Weickian sensemaking is episodic rather than
continuous: “For sensemaking to be seen as an ongoing process, the underlying
episodic ontology of sensemaking needs to be replaced with another that sees
sensemaking as ubiquitous rather than exceptional” (Sandberg and Tsoukas 2015).
This requires for world enactment to be embraced as probabilistic by way of top-
down/bottom-up generative prediction error minimization. Instead, Weick’s
sensemaking perspective is stuck in the classical top-down centric cause-effect
logic. Thus, sensemaking must be less heuristics but more algorithm.
Cognitive heuristics are a form of ‘cognitive simpliﬁcation’ (Schwenk 1988) or
‘rules of thumb’ and “tools [that] empower the human mind with what the poet John
Keats (1891) called ‘negative capability’ – the ability to survive and thrive in
uncertainty” (Hertwig et al. 2019). The so-called simple rules that strategists learn
from process experience have formed an important stream within strategy research.
While “heuristics are ‘rational,’ especially in unpredictable markets” (Bingham
and Eisenhardt 2011), they are nonetheless reﬂective of “humans’ inability to reason
according to the complex [Nash Equilibrium]” (Hertwig et al. 2019). However,
under uncertainty, “[r]esearch on ‘fast and frugal’ heuristics [. . .] ﬁnds that simple
heuristics can outperform analytically complicated and information-intensive
2.1

9

approaches even when information and time are available” (Bingham and Eisenhardt
2011).2
In fact, in environments characterized by increasing levels of complexity and
uncertainty or so-called VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity),
the effectiveness of heuristics (generated from ‘repeated games’ experience) may be
limited in one-shot games:
The interaction of strategic uncertainty and incomplete information makes for a particularly
unpredictable game, especially if there is no relevant historical prior incident to refer to. In
repeated games, there are various ways to reduce the degree of strategic uncertainty [. . .]
Many important real-world decisions are either one-shot games or strategic situations that
are so rare that very little prior information exists to reduce uncertainty. . . How can players
resolve, reduce, or otherwise handle the various kinds of uncertainty involved in strategic
one-shot interactions, which do not afford the opportunity for learning? (Spiliopoulos and
Hertwig 2020)
Generative processes of top-down/bottom-up hypothesis testing (i.e., prediction
error minimization) rather than top-down (rule-based) simpliﬁcation are guiding the
path to navigating a discontinuous world. Heuristics—no matter how well-trained—
are considered to be a rather sub-optimal process (or strategy) to successfully surf
uncertainty (Clark 2016). In fact, heuristics rather tame uncertainty. Heuristics
reinforce dominant logics in form of pattern recognition and tend to disregard
dissonant bottom-up stimuli as noise: “Each heuristic’s policy represents a wager
on the structure of the environment in question; it bets that ignoring some of the
(often noisy) available information will enable faster, and potentially even more
accurate, decisions” (Hertwig et al. 2019). In fact, heuristics may reinforce the
phenomenon of deliberate ignorance (Hertwig and Engel 2020) and tame curiosity’s
information-enriching drive as a foundation for prediction error minimization.
More importantly, in the socially interactive sphere (where it eventually all plays
out), the usefulness of heuristics to strategy formulation must be questioned. “[A]ll
or most model competitions involved heuristics that concern individual decision
making; thus, leaving open the question of whether their success would generalize to
strategic situations in the social world. There are certainly grounds for doubt”
(Spiliopoulos and Hertwig 2020):
The philosopher Sterelny (2003), for instance, argued that simple heuristics—despite
reaching surprisingly high levels of accuracy in nonsocial worlds—will fail in interactions
with other intelligent (and especially competitive) agents. For it is precisely in such
situations that simple rules of thumb will go wrong. (Spiliopoulos and Hertwig 2020)
Finally, heuristics are fundamentally anchored in a worldview of environmental
adaptation rather than enactment, i.e., resolving uncertainty is rather treated as a
matter of adaptation to an exogenously determined ‘game’. This book rejects
environmental adaptation as a viable survival strategy in a perpetually discontinuous
(one-shot interactions) environment.

Sensing, Sensemaking, and Strategic Renewal

Cognitive maps3 are closely related to heuristics (Schwenk 1988) and can be
considered a potent form of visualizing sensemaking in form of “graphic represen-
tations that locate people in relation to their information environments. Maps provide
a frame of reference for what is known and believed. They highlight some informa-
tion and fail to include other information, either because it is deemed less important,
or because it is not known. They exhibit the reasoning behind purposeful actions”
(Fiol and Huff 1992).
The power of maps should not be underestimated. However, cognitive mapping
has not been considered—not as a method, not as a metaphor, not as a visualization
of cause-effect relationships—for precisely three reasons: (1) This book is not
interested in the content but the process dimension of strategy formulation. Why a
certain cognition led ex post to particular actions is not of interest. (2) In the context
of the Free Energy Governance framework, any cognitive mapping is incomplete
and rather useless unless the circular causality of top-down predictions and bottom-
up stimuli can be dynamically mapped. Mapping only Upper Echelon’s top-down
cognition is incomplete and rather interests-serving (Wood 1992), reinforcing Upper
Echelon logics. (3) Cognitive mapping is a form of explanatory rather than ‘design
science’. It is more hindsight- than foresight-oriented, centered around ‘what was’ or
‘what is’ instead of ‘what will’.
The map’s effectiveness is a consequence of the selectivity with which it brings this past to
bear on the present. This selectivity, this focus, this particular attention, this [. . .] interest
[. . .] is what frees the map to be a representation of the past [. . .] This is to say that maps
work [. . .] by serving interests. Because these interests select what form the vast storehouse
of knowledge about the earth the map will represent, these interests are embodied in the
map as presences and absences (Wood 1992; emphasis by DBK).
Cognitive mapping cannot capture the action-centric and dynamic process of
becoming. Free Energy Governance is anchored in becoming, dedicated to optimiz-
ing posterior probabilities of beliefs about the consequences of today’s enactment.
Precisely, the question arises what utility cognitive maps serve in highly dynamic
and discontinuous environments. There is a risk that obsoleteness is innate to the
process of mapping, particularly in dynamic environments. Finally, one must ques-
tion whether cognitive mapping is inherently ﬂawed as “there may be little or no
direct introspective access to higher order cognitive processes” (Nisbett and Wilson
1977):
Subjects are sometimes (a) unaware of the existence of a stimulus that importantly
inﬂuenced a response, (b) unaware of the existence of the response, and (c) unaware that
the stimulus has affected the response. It is proposed that when people attempt to report on
their cognitive processes, that is, on the processes mediating the effects of a stimulus on a
response, they do not do so on the basis of any true introspection. Instead, their reports are
3“The term ‘cognitive map’ was ﬁrst used by Tolman (1948) in discussions of learning in laboratory
animals and human beings. These cognitive maps consist of concepts about aspects of the decision
environment and beliefs about cause-and-effect relationships between them. Such maps serve as
interpretive lenses” (Schwenk 1988).

based on a priori, implicit causal theories, or judgments about the extent to which a particular
stimulus is a plausible cause of a given response.
Cognitive mapping is representative of the deterministic view of the world—akin
to a physical cause-effect chain—and should be considered rather anti-clocked in the
face of discontinuous market environments. To effectively minimize surprise in this
‘uncertain world’, we need unsupervised and generative processes that connect
in circular causality purpose-driven top-town predictions with action-generated
bottom-up stimuli, continuously reﬁning prediction models relevant to ﬁrm perfor-
mance and survival through epistemic foraging, i.e., environmental engagement in
form of en-actment and in pursuit of free energy minimization.
It is neuroscience’s predictive coding (Friston 2010; Hohwy 2013; Clark 2016)
that allows us to take management research’s sensemaking perspective as well as
nexus of structure and cognition (Ocasio 1997; Gavetti 2005) one step further to
provide a more complete and relevant framework for applying sensing and
sensemaking in the context of strategic renewal. Effectively, sensing and
sensemaking are empowered by the circular causality between top-down knowledge
structures (prediction models, predictions, hypotheses, and guesses) and bottom-up
stimuli/data stemming from resource markets:
The challenge of sensing capabilities is that their effectiveness relies on the cognitive lens
that is used to observe and interpret the world around us. The fundamental tradeoff is
between the uncertainty minimization of deductive and inductive logic that leads to crisp
answers about opportunities but can miss the opportunities that are too anomalous or too
ambiguous. (Dong et al. 2016)
The purpose-driven, action-centric, dissonance-pursuing, and enactivist lens
forms the cognitive basis for ﬁrm performance-relevant sensing and sensemaking.
“Naturally intelligent systems do not passively await sensory stimulation,” but
“before an ‘input’ arrives on the scene, these pro-active cognitive systems are
already busy predicting [. . .] all they need to process are sensed deviations from
the predicted state” (Clark 2016). Taylor and Van Every (2000) and Starbuck and
Milliken (1988) equally highlighted the fallacy of putting perception at the start of
the causal sequences and emphasized action’s center stage importance to perception
and perceptional ﬁlters: “Perceptions are partly predictions that may change reality”
(Starbuck and Milliken 1988).
Abduction (Hansen 2008) is one form of sensemaking that is of increasing
interest to the study of strategic management, often simply deﬁned as ‘any hypoth-
esis or guess is valid’. “While deduction and induction are important, neither pro-
duces truly new opportunities” (Dong et al. 2016). Rather than starting from a
proven template (deduction) or being trapped in inductive logic “[preventing]
individuals from interpreting evidence in alternate ways” (Dong et al. 2016),
“abductive reasoning provides managers with the cognitive tools they need to
sense opportunities and transform them into hypotheses that can be tested” (Dong
et al. 2016):
Abductive reasoning usually begins with a surprising observation or experience. This is what
shatters our habit and motivates us to create a hypothesis that might resolve the anomaly.
Abduction is an inferential procedure in which we create a conjecture that, if it were
12

Sensing, Sensemaking, and Strategic Renewal

correct, would make the surprising anomaly part of our normal understanding of the world.
(Van de Ven 2007; emphasis by DBK)
Innovative abduction, for example, “requires coming up with two new rules: a
strategic option that logically connects to the desired outcome and a new way to
combine a company’s resources and capabilities, or a new business model, which
has not been proven, to implement the option” (Dong et al. 2016). Essentially,
continuous strategic renewal is inferential.
The ‘micro-macro dichotomy’ of “how sensing and sensemaking - essentially
cognitive activities that occur at the individual level - transmorph into an actionable
ﬁrm-level view, i.e. ‘organizational cognition’” is elegantly addressed by Dong et al.
(2016): “While hypothesis setting is an individual activity, hypothesis testing is an
organizational activity [. . .] Organizational processes for the testing of new hypoth-
eses do not require creativity; they require the scientiﬁc and rigorous generation of
new data to conﬁrm or refute the hypothesis.” This is the essence of generative free-
energy minimization.
Effectively, sensing and sensemaking is a form of organizational learning: action-
centric hypothesis testing that connects the individual level with that of the ﬁrm.
Crossan’s 4I model (intuiting, interpreting, integrating, and institutionalizing) as
applied to the context of strategic renewal (Crossan and Berdrow 2003) provides a
framework for the process of trans-morphing individual sensing and sensemaking
(cognition) into ﬁrm-level strategic action. Intuiting and interpreting a hypothesis
starts at the individual level, and subsequently the interpretation (sensemaking)
process becomes socialized, integrated, and institutionalized at the ﬁrm level.
Upper Echelon’s ability to avoid being trapped in ‘dominant logics’ and to openly
and abductively encourage and embrace bottom-up stimuli and engage the organi-
zation cross-hierarchically in testing goal-directed hypotheses is the essence of
sensing and sensemaking as the foundation for ﬁrm performance and survival.
Clark (2016) asserts that action, cognition, and perception are continuously
co-constructed. Indeed, “business environments are [not] objective environments,
awaiting discovery through the application of formal analytical techniques”
(Hodgkinson 2015), but are enacted.
Our understanding of the “brain as a passive and stimulus-driven, taking ener-
getic inputs from the senses and turning them into a coherent percept by a kind of
step-wise build-up” (Clark 2016: 51) has moved to the ‘active view’ where the
“largest contributor to ongoing neural response is the ceaseless anticipatory buzz of
downwards-ﬂowing neural prediction that drives perception and action in circular
causal ﬂow” (Clark 2016: 51). Therefore, “brains are not, fundamentally, in the
business of ‘processing inputs’ at all. Rather, they are in the business of predicting
[en-acting] their inputs. This pro-active neural strategy keeps us poised for action”
(Clark 2016).
No board of directors can afford to be a passively ‘stimulus-driven’ and ‘energetic
inputs’- intaking organ. Unfortunately, entrenched ‘best practices’ have turned
boards into exactly this. ‘Best practices’ effectively nurture ‘skilled incompetence’
when it comes to abductive sensemaking. Equally, the ﬁeld level (close to resource
2.1

13

markets) where the power of signal sourcing resides must go beyond the ‘input-
intaking’ but must share the stimuli bottom-up for collective sensemaking. However,
in the absence of a cross-hierarchically integrated organizing framework—powered
by the circular causality of top-down prediction/bottom-up stimuli error minimiza-
tion—it is hard to see how ﬁrms can effectively optimize activation of all possible
sources of intelligence and sensors listening to and enacting what wants to emerge.
Prediction error minimization forms the core of both ‘noticing’ (Starbuck and
Milliken 1988) and ‘interpretation’ systems (Daft and Weick 1984) and lays the
foundation for a ﬁrm’s capacity for continuous strategic renewal. Top-down/bottom-
up connectivity, leadership’s cognitive capabilities for intuiting (sensing) and
interpreting (sensemaking), and, more importantly, the ﬁrm’s social processes for
integrating and institutionalizing the purpose-directed collapsing of belief functions
(probabilities) constitute a ﬁrm’s system of shared meaning and expectations as a
basis for continuous strategic renewal.
It is the dynamic capability view (DCV), in particular its Helfatian interpretation
(Helfat et al. 2007)—to purposefully create, extend, or modify [the ﬁrm’s] resource
base—that has generated a promising and growing conversation around linking
capabilities, cognition, and strategic renewal. However, while powerful as a concept,
so far DCV has not provided a uniﬁed theoretical framework. The challenge is to
operationalize sensing and sensemaking (i.e., prediction error minimization) as
speciﬁc dynamic (meta-)capabilities at both the individual as well as ﬁrm level.
“Traditionally, researchers have located dynamic capabilities at the organiza-
tional level of analysis; [. . .] starting in the early 2000s, the recognition that such
capabilities can also exist at the individual level has become increasingly diffused”
(Schilke et al. 2018). Helfat and Peteraf (2015) ﬁrmly headlined the conversation as
‘managerial cognitive capabilities and the microfoundations of dynamic capabilities’.
Equally, there is a need to enrich the conversation with a complementary research
stream concerning the board’s cognitive capabilities of sensing and sensemaking in
the context of strategic renewal and, more speciﬁcally, linking structure, cognition,
and capabilities.
Ocasio’s attention-based view (ABV; Ocasio 1997) has provided a framework
linking structure (i.e., organizational hierarchy) and cognition embracing strategy
process “as assemblages of tightly and loosely coupled networks of operational and
governance channels” (Ocasio and Joseph 2005) and “strategy formulation as a ﬂuid
and distributed process”. The board of directors’ explicit role as an integral part of
this distributed process, however, has been marginalized or simply ignored.
Structure and cognition are mutually constitutive. The effectiveness of multi-
scale top-down/bottom-up integration is dependent on lateral integration at each
hierarchical layer. In other words, the inter-hierarchical connectivity is dependent on
intra-hierarchical top-down/bottom-up ‘heedful interrelating’ in pursuit of ‘shared
meaning’ and performance. In this context, the method of OKRs4 (objectives and
4OKRs (objectives and key results), in contrast to simply pursuing KPIs (key performance
indicators), has become an increasingly popular framework for empowering teams to reach their
full potential through aligning around objectives (goals) in form of self-organization.
14

key results) has proven to be an invaluable and dynamic tool to foster informal
exchanges at the (ﬁeld) level of resource markets, approximating self-organization:
[If] we are to develop a truly comprehensive understanding of the socio-cognitive dynamics
of industry leadership, competition, and change, it is essential to consider the role played by
generative mechanisms within and across multiple levels of analysis — from the individual
to the intra-organizational group, to the organizational, inter-organizational and (even inter-)
industry levels. (Hodgkinson 2015)
By default, uncertainty and complexity are subjective concepts but are consis-
tently deployed in management research as objectively determined. Environmental
sensing and sensemaking are nonsensical in the absence of having set the ﬁrm’s
(existential) purpose in the ﬁrst place. “Purpose – not strategy – is the reason an
organization exists. Its deﬁnition and articulation must be top management’s ﬁrst
responsibility” (Bartlett and Goshal 1994). Foss and Lindenberg (2013) make an
important—microfoundations-centric—contribution by applying a goal-framing
perspective to strategic value creation:
On the basis of goal-framing theory one can thus argue that the heart of value creation in
ﬁrms lies in the motivation for joint production for all involved. No matter what the ﬁrm
wants to achieve, optimal value creation will always crucially depend on eliciting a moti-
vation among employees that is directed at common goals, such that organizational members
are motivated to choose their actions in terms of joint goals and exert intelligent effort to
reach joint goals. Foss and Lindenberg (2013)
However, Foss and Lindenberg’s (2013) linkage of motivation, goal-framing, and
value creation fails to resolve the very dilemma they highlight, i.e., that “overarching
goals of employees are subject to a top-down contagion process by overarching
goals from top management” (Foss and Lindenberg 2013). In fact, goal-framing
theory lacks a structural, cognitive, and capability-centric foundation resolving a
ﬁrm’s top-down/bottom-up dysconnectivity. Similar to existing and traditional
logics of organizing, it falls short of explaining how goals and predictions are
(self-evidently) generated in the ﬁrst place and what generative processes are
essential to empower goals and corresponding performance objectives (OKR) to
evolve.
The drive for self-organizing mechanisms has gradually moved from employee
empowerment (Fisher and Fisher 1997) and collective intelligence (CI) in form of
crowdsourcing (Bonabeau 2009)—deploying the generative power of information
technologies to tap into the collective’s knowledge-base—to collaborative intelli-
gence (CQ) emphasizing the need for a shift in the leadership model from ‘having all
the answers to raising the right questions’ as digital tools are increasingly deployed
to enable goal-directed intelligence deliberations in distributed multi-intelligence
systems. Massive collective intelligence (MCI, IMD 2020) is one of the latest
AI-enabled contributions in the ﬁeld of organizing, leveraging the crowd to generate
the very query in the ﬁrst place. MCI is still in an infancy stage but points toward a
potentially promising direction.
One important CQ development, which still remains difﬁcult to judge in terms of
lasting relevance, is the open strategy (OS) practice (Tavakoli et al. 2017; Hautz
2.1
Strategic Cognition: Sensing and Sensemaking
15

et al. 2017): “[OS] is categorically different from traditional ‘top-level strategizing
and qualitatively different from ‘bottom-up strategizing’. [. . .] [OS] is unique in its
overall transparency [. . .], wide inclusiveness [. . .], and the central use of social IT to
effectively enable mass participation” (Tavakoli et al. 2017), “promising access to
dispersed and creative strategic ideas [. . .] and increased approval of strategy by
employees, customers and partners” (Tavakoli et al. 2017). Essentially, the quality of
“transparent discourse” (Luedicke et al. 2017), “democratic decision-making,” and
“IT-enableness” (Luedicke et al. 2017) fundamentally determines OS’ success.
All these CI/CQ approaches are neither distinctly nor uniformly deﬁned.
However, they all share a desire to move organizing away from top-down leadership-
controlled content to something more transparent and unsupervised, direct-democrat-
ically engaging ﬁeld intelligence. Essentially, it is a desire for more self-organization in
increasingly discontinuous environments. The question arises, however, whether any
of those approaches have gone far enough to be of consistently practical relevance as a
foundation for continuous strategic renewal. There are several high-proﬁle case stud-
ies—such as IBM, Daimler, HypoVereinsbank, Premium Cola, Rabobank, Red Hat,
and Wikimedia5—documenting diverse experiences with OS.
Tavakoli et al.’s (2017) literature review summarizes some of OS’ key limitations
in terms of transparency and inclusion: “While Daimler gained access to heteroge-
nous ideas from a variety of areas in the organization, some senior managers
perceived the initiative as not valuable and did not participate. [. . .] While
HypoVereinsbank was able to access a broad pool of knowledge, it was noted that
the organisers were concerned that a somewhat secretive culture could hinder open
strategy adoption. [. . .] While IBM collected creative and unconventional ideas from
the crowd, a high level of resources investment (to build and manage the initiative)
was noted. [. . .] Premium Cola’s open approach has led to the emergence of a
collective identity, legitimised collective decisions, and maintained motivation
among practitioners. However, there were also fears of exposing too much
externally.”
In summary, OS is rather project-centric than a coherent new strategy governance
framework. The very limitations transpiring through the various case studies suggest
that OS is likely to battle with Scharmer’s (2018) three ‘enemies’ or ‘inner voices of
resistance’: Voice of Judgment, Voice of Cynicism, and Voice of Fear. Dobusch and
Müller-Seitz’s (2019) contribution may lead OS’ future development path: “We
argue that it is a purposeful combination of open and closed components that
constitutes a precondition for establishing a certain, feasible open quality of
strategy-making processes. [. . .] we do not understand the necessity of ‘closing for
the beneﬁt of openness’ as a contradiction but rather as a productive dynamic that
comprises ‘pushes and pulls that become a check-and-balance system’.”

Sensing, Sensemaking, and Strategic Renewal

No cross-hierarchical governance framework has yet been advanced to institu-
tionalize sensing and sensemaking as unsupervised learning and unlearning. Once
we deﬁne sensing, sensemaking, and strategic renewal in form of action-centric
circular causality linking purpose, prediction models, predictions, and prediction
error minimization, a new logic of strategic renewal emerges—dynamically
connecting structure (hierarchy), cognition, and capabilities.
In fact, a ﬁrm’s sensing and sensemaking capability is directly determined by the
top-down/bottom-up circular causality of belief propagation and message-passing.
Unless lower hierarchical (ﬁeld) levels are purpose directedly empowered to sense
and make sense of less salient, transient, but nonetheless transformative signals, the
ﬁrm is likely to sub-optimally direct attention and resources, eventually accentuating
a ﬁrm’s underperformance and ensuing dissipation.
“When a business declines it begins gradually, almost imperceptibly, until so
many failures pile up that the unraveling arrives with unnerving speed” (McNish and
Silcoff 2015). But more importantly: internal dysfunctionality and strategic disori-
entation rather than environmental change tend to design the antechamber of decline.
Any story of corporate failure or, for that matter, absence of strategic renewal can
only be fully grasped once structure (including the board of directors), cognition, and
capabilities are linked in circular causality.
2.2
Strategic Renewal
Strategic renewal as a deﬁned concept has laid the foundation for a distinct stream of
research in strategic management. Several publications stand out, most notably:
Schmitt et al. (2018) for a rather up-to-date overview of past research and theoretical
tensions, Schmitt et al. (2016) for linking strategic renewal to environmental scarcity, Eggers
and Kaplan (2013) for linking cognition and renewal, Agarwal and Helfat (2009) for
emphasizing the role of dynamic capabilities in renewing the ﬁrm’s resource base, Crossan
and Berdrow (2003) for an in-depth case study deﬁning strategic renewal as tension of
organizational learnings, Golden and Zajac (2001) as well as Westphal and Fredrickson
(2001) for emphasizing the board of directors’ critical role for strategic renewal, Floyd and
Lane (2000) for taking strategic renewal beyond Upper Echelon and emphasizing its cross-
hierarchical nature, speciﬁcally the relevance of middle management, Barr et al. (1992) for
relating strategic renewal to sensing (noticing) and sensemaking (interpretation), and Huff
et al. (1992) for studying the antecedents of strategic renewal in terms of the dynamic
interaction of cumulative stress and inertia.
Numerous deﬁnitions have been advanced emphasizing consistently its distinc-
tiveness from the concept of ‘strategic change’:
Strategic change functions as an umbrella concept referring to many different types of
strategic changes within and across ﬁrms [. . .], but strategic renewal refers only to a speciﬁc
type of strategic change – the transformation of the ﬁrm’s current strategic intent and
capabilities. (Schmitt et al. 2018)
2.2
Strategic Renewal
17

The very origins of strategic renewal research were motivated primarily by
deterministically understanding its antecedents such as CEO turnover/tenure, TMT
demographics, organizational demographics (size/age/lifecycle), past performance,
and, above all, the ﬁrm-environment linkage suggesting that environmental change
leads to organizational stress, which in turn confronts the ﬁrm’s inertia and imposes
strategic renewal to ‘reﬁt’ the ﬁrm with its environment (Huff and Huff 1995).
According to this view, the alignment of ﬁrm with environment is deﬁned as the
predominant driver of strategic renewal (‘co-alignment school’).
In distributed and discontinuous market environments, environmental adapta-
tion—based on retrospective sensemaking of environmental change—is no longer
(if it ever was) a viable strategic objective or modus operandi. Therefore, environ-
mental ‘co-alignment’ is rejected as a rather futile, illusory, and unsustainable
objective. A ﬁrm must operate on the basis that its actions change, create, or destroy
markets (‘co-creation school’). Environment and environmental change are actor-,
i.e., observer-dependent concepts: “quantum level phenomena support – i.e., enable
the emergence of – molecular mechanics (e.g., statistical mechanics and thermody-
namics), from which biological and cosmological (e.g., classical and possibly
Bayesian) mechanics emerge in turn” (Friston 2019). More speciﬁcally, starting at
the subatomic and moving to the cosmological level (bottom-up) rather than
top-down, may allow us to appreciate the co-creation interpretation of the world.
Strategic renewal, fundamentally, is not a responsive but rather proactive and
continuous commitment to environmental enactment in pursuit of future ﬁrm per-
formance and survival. Strategic renewal as ‘organizational becoming’ is the cate-
gorical imperative of ‘being in the game’. It is not a matter of choice. What matters
are the purpose-directed learning and knowledge-creating processes that circularly
connect bottom-up stimuli/message-passing with top-down strategic belief propaga-
tion in view of optimizing resource reconﬁguration:
Although the terms ‘information’ and ‘knowledge’ are often used interchangeably, there is a
clear distinction between information and knowledge [. . .] In short, information is a ﬂow of
messages, while knowledge is created and organized by the very ﬂow of information,
anchored on the commitment and beliefs of its holder. (Nonaka 1994)
It is a generative and action-centric process of Upper Echelon prediction error
minimization, continuously developing the ﬁrm’s prediction models and engaging
the entire organization and beyond: embodied, enactive, extended (Clark 2016):
Learning is here deﬁned as the detection and correction of errors, and error as any feature of
knowledge or of knowing that makes action ineffective. Error is a mismatch: a condition of
learning, and matching a second condition of learning. The detection and correction of error
produces learning and the lack of either or both inhibits learning. (Argyris 1976: 365)
Thus, a thinking born of curiosity, revolt, and change (Rovelli 2021) is essential
to strategic renewal. At its core, strategic renewal is action-centric prediction error
minimization, encompassing a “process, content, and outcome of refreshment or
replacement of attributes of an organization” (Agarwal and Helfat 2009), managing
“the tension between institutionalized learning and the processes of intuiting,
interpreting, and integrating” new learnings (Crossan and Berdrow 2003) as well
18
2
Sensing, Sensemaking, and Strategic Renewal

as “the tension between exploration and exploitation” (Crossan and Berdrow 2003).
Strategic renewal is “an iterative process of belief, action, and learning” (Floyd and
Lane 2000), where “periods of incremental adjustment (single-loop learning) are
broken by bursts of revolutionary change (double-loop learning)” (Floyd and Lane
2000).
In particular, Floyd and Lane’s (2000) deﬁnition of strategic renewal as “an
iterative process of belief, action, and learning” captures the essence of Fristonian
prediction error minimization but falls short of providing a tangible model. It is only
when we start expressing beliefs as probability distributions and action as a state that
precedes perception conditioned by a Markovian boundary intermediating the inter-
nal and external states, all dedicated in circular causality to continuously optimizing
the updating of beliefs (i.e., learning), a mathematically self-consistent model
emerges.
This book adopts a cross-hierarchical, capabilities-driven and action-centric
learning perspective in deﬁning strategic renewal, which is best captured by Schmitt
et al. (2018):
Strategic renewal (a) involves a transformation of the ﬁrm’s core capabilities associated with
competitive advantage, (b) concerns the entire organization and has implications across
organizational levels and (c) is essential to break path dependence and ensure the ﬁrm’s
long-term survival.
To approach strategic renewal as an Upper Echelon-centric top-down-only chal-
lenge is nonsense. “Given the importance of social interactions to knowledge
development and organizational learning, we believe that renewal can be under-
stood best as a system of relational or social exchanges” (Schmitt et al. 2018;
emphasis by DBK), which is effectively the essence of reality construction. Indeed,
once strategic renewal is embraced as a ‘system of relational or social exchanges’,
the need for a cross-hierarchical connect emerges:
Although ideas are formed in the minds of individuals, interaction between individuals
typically plays a critical role in developing these ideas. That is to say, ‘communities of
interaction’ contribute to the ampliﬁcation and development of new knowledge [. . .] these
communities might span departmental or indeed organizational boundaries. (Nonaka 1994;
emphasis by DBK)
Floyd and Lane (2000) approached strategic renewal as a manifestation of
‘strategic role conﬂict’ emphasizing the difference in nature of ‘boundary-spanning
interactions’ at the operating level ( focus on factor or product markets), within top
management (focus on capital markets and shareholder concerns), and middle
managers ( focus on mediating between the two levels and on cues from any one of
the three sub-environments). The more dominant a top-down-directed (‘induced’)
rather than bottom-up-inspired (‘autonomous’) strategic renewal process, the more
likely that critical intelligence form resource markets is ignored and transient and
transformation-bearing market signals are lost:
The tension between induced and autonomous strategic renewal reﬂects the fundamental
question of who initiates and drives strategic renewal initiatives [. . .] Past strategic renewal
research shows that top-down driven renewal initiatives can create institutionalized contexts
2.2

that determine acceptable and inacceptable behaviours and processes, effectively creating
barriers to bottom-up strategic renewal initiatives [. . .]. Senior managers therefore risk
reinforcing their own, centralized renewal orientation [. . .], while stiﬂing lower-level man-
agers and employees’ creative abilities in the process. (Schmitt et al. 2018)
The more top-down-centric and exclusive the ‘community of interactions’ initi-
ating strategic renewal, the less effective organizational learning may be, and the
more questionable the transformative nature, performance, and sustainability of
strategic renewal. Further, one may propose that the more top-down-centric and
exclusive that ‘community’, the more likely that the strategic renewal process is
outward-oriented, i.e., turning to M&A, minority investments, and venture-
partnering to provide access to new knowledge and markets.
In the absence of circular top-down/bottom-up organizational learning, the ﬁrm
may become trapped in top leadership’s dominant logics, highly dependent on
M&A/joint-venture-driven innovation, and increasingly disconnected from the
very intelligence the ﬁrm’s ﬁeld close to resource markets beholds. Eventually,
ﬁnancial control (M&A and alliancing) is likely to squeeze out strategic control
(in-house innovation), making the ﬁrm potentially rather more than less vulnerable
to survival risk as innovation can no longer be generated from within the ﬁrm:
[M&A] diminishes internal innovation [. . .] produces signiﬁcant transaction costs and
absorbs substantial amounts of managerial time and energy, whether assets are being
acquired or divested. As ﬁrms acquire more units, diversify through acquisition, or both,
information-processing demands on corporate managers increase geometrically. They thus
tend to emphasize ﬁnancial controls over strategic controls. Firms using high levels of
strategic controls produce more internal innovations, whereas ﬁrms using high levels of
ﬁnancial controls tend to produce fewer internal innovations but acquire more innovation
externally. (Hitt et al. 1996)
Financial and strategic control, respectively, correlate curvilinearly to ﬁrm per-
formance: too little or too much of one or the other is potentially entropy-bound. The
ﬁrm is challenged to ﬁnd an optimal balance between external and internal innova-
tion to power continuous strategic renewal as a sustainable foundation for ﬁrm
performance and survival. Indeed, the question arises, how to best balance ﬁnancial
and strategic control and whether the board of directors potentially assumes a critical
and unique strategic role in this process.
More speciﬁcally, “[successful] changes in the organizational domain are pre-
ceded by bottom-up learning and internal selection. Unless preceded by learning,
domain shifts increase the organization’s vulnerability to external selection and
expose to signiﬁcant survival risk” (Floyd and Lane 2000). Learning must start
organically and bottom-up from the heart of resource markets (clients, suppliers,
technologies) and should only then be complemented by M&A. Strategic renewal
initiatives must be based on continuous top-down/bottom-up learning loops spanning
all hierarchical levels (Mom et al. 2007). Indeed, domain shifts that kick-start with
M&A are likely to exponentially increase the risk proﬁle of the ﬁrm’s strategic renewal.
Transaction costs related to M&A integration may become disproportionally high.
Strategic renewal research is in need of a more comprehensive framework:
structurally (resolving the hierarchical top-down/bottom-up ‘learning disconnect’),
20

Sensing, Sensemaking, and Strategic Renewal

cognitively (embracing environment as a matter of enactment), and in terms of
capabilities (balancing ﬁnancial and strategic control as well as exploitation and
exploration). The board of directors should be integrated as a distinct cognitive
variable into the ‘community of interactions’. But, more importantly, the question
arises whether the board possesses the right capabilities to be of strategic relevance
in discontinuous market environments.
When Siebel (2019) deﬁnes digital transformation as wholesale reinvention, he
effectively establishes the categorical imperative of strategic renewal. There cannot
be any ‘wholesale reinvention’, however, without addressing ﬁrst the ﬁrm’s gover-
nance framework.

Chapter 3
Microfoundations of Strategic Governance
Abstract There is no universal governance model. The strategic role of the board
does vary as a function of culture, laws, governance orientation, ownership structure,
and ﬁrm-context. The period of 1998–2001, a time of ﬁnancial markets ‘irrational
exuberance’ dominated by a governance orientation centered around stock price
considerations, has given birth to today’s compliance-driven governance logic
ruling public companies. Simply put, ever since corporate governance has been
estranging the board as a uniquely integral part of strategy process. Coincidentally,
during this very period, management research started complementing thereto demo-
graphic input-output models with behavioral and cognitive dimensions. While
opening a new conversation around the cognitive microfoundations of board effec-
tiveness, to this day, the study of the board’s strategic role remains conﬁned to the
board room and treats environment as an exogenous variable. The top-down culti-
vated ‘hierarchical disconnect’ so characteristic of traditional corporate governance
(TCG) and strategy processes is more likely to fuel prediction error, reinforcing the
perception that the world is unpredictable and uncertain. Indeed, the very limitations
of corporate governance research may be an astute reﬂection of the very real and
often self-inﬂicted limitations of the board’s strategic role. Shareholders are chal-
lenged to ensure that the board’s full (strategic) potential is not wasted. More
speciﬁcally, there is a need for a new (self-organizing) governance logic.
The board of directors is a unique and integral part of a ﬁrm’s Upper Echelon. It acts
from within and without the ﬁrm as a boundary spanner and should encapsulate
strategy process’s constructive tension between organization and (enacted) environ-
ment, exploitation and exploration as well as ﬁnancial and strategic controls.
There is no universal governance model. The strategic role of the board does vary
as a function of culture, laws, governance orientation (Kwee et al. 2011), ownership
structure (public, private equity, founder-/family-led/-controlled, or a combination
thereof), and ﬁrm-speciﬁc context. Hilb (2012) distinguishes four types of boards:
administrative, entrepreneurial, directing/controlling, and supervisory. However,

Continental stakeholder-centric model embracing a broader set of values and inter-
ests), all existing corporate governance approaches suffer from severe shortcomings.
While in Switzerland the board’s strategic mandate is law-imposed, in other
jurisdictions there are limits to what can or should be expected from the board of
directors in terms of strategizing. Theoretical conceptions are no less diverse and
controversial: most notably, “[m]anagerial hegemony theory [. . .] argues that boards
are a legal ﬁction dominated by management” (Hendry and Kiel 2004). In most
leading capital market jurisdictions, public policy or the so-called ‘best practices’
have advocated at accelerating pace a rather sterile, independence-centric, and
stereotypical diversity-oriented approach to corporate governance.
“There is a danger, however, that the compliant board is breeding formalism,
group-think and risk-aversion at the expense of operational understanding, strategic
focus and independent thinking” (Khezri 2014). Effectively, the board has been
distanced from initiating and directing strategic renewal. Unless lawmakers evolve
corporate governance guidelines ‘in tune’ with the requirements of a distributed and
discontinuous world, the board is either relegated to strategic irrelevance or increas-
ingly represents a source of inertia reﬂective of its struggle with growing complexity.
The period of 1998–2001, a time of ‘irrational exuberance’1, was a time when
board members at some of the world’s largest companies developed a self-identity
akin to that of a venture capitalist. Proliﬁc failures of the time were Tyco, Enron, and
WorldCom. Acceleration in stock price appreciation through excessive ﬁnancial
control, particularly in form of M&A rather than organic growth, was corporate
governance’s dominant mantra at many companies. Board members were trapped in
blind followership of overdominant and overconﬁdent CEOs, creating not only
multidimensional conﬂicts of interest but eventually fertilizing ﬁnancial self-
enrichment at the expense of shareholders and the common good. Pre-IPO candi-
dates were no less immune to the trend (Khezri 2001):
Excessive management option packages fueled greed and encouraged corporate leverage.
This, in addition to M&A activity [,,,] became the system’s predominant characteristics, and
the strength of the share price emerged as the fundamental pillar for the survival of the
system [. . .] During the 1990s, directors’ performance was increasingly measured against
how well they understood both the mechanics of M&A and capital markets and their ability
to keep the ‘winning team’ motivated to take the business to its next growth phase. (Khezri
2002)
The 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States has been the most prominent
legislative product resulting from ‘irrational exuberance’, imposing draconian
measures on the audit and ﬁnancial representations of publicly listed companies.
‘Exuberance’ in capital markets also coincided with a productive period in academic
1Alan Greenspan, then Federal Reserve Board Chairman, gave a speech to the American Enterprise
Institute on December 5, 1996, saying that “irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset
values.” While markets only brieﬂy dipped, the period from 1996 to 2001/2 experienced ‘irrational
exuberance’ and a neglect for prudent corporate governance. Nobel Prize winning Yale Professor
Robert Schiller used the expression for his book publication Irrational Exuberance in 2000,
eventually coinciding with the start of a stock market contraction.

Microfoundations of Strategic Governance

research concerning the board’s strategic role. Management research started
complementing thereto demographic input-output models with behavioral and cog-
nitive dimensions.
McNulty and Pettigrew (1999) highlighted in their important contribution ‘Strat-
egists on the Board’ that “knowledge about the structure and composition of boards
exceeds knowledge about their behavioural dynamics”. Indeed, we generally know
very little about the informal and tacit processes that critically shape the formal
governance output. The conclusion of their study is that boards rarely initiate but can
challenge and contribute to strategy. Their study is relevant to the extent that it went
beyond the traditional ‘demographic input-output’ approach and conﬁrmed the
importance of the behavioral dimension in assessing a board’s role in strategy
process—independent of any regulatory or law-imposed mandate or boundary.
Rindova (1999) was among the ﬁrst to link managerial cognition (Kiesler and
Sproull 1982) to corporate governance, distilling the board’s distinct cognitive
contribution to strategy process, speciﬁcally in terms of ‘environmental scanning
and interpretation’. Her contribution can be considered seminal, laying the grounds
for a ‘stewardship-inspired’ corporate governance approach (Davis et al. 1997) that
is now widely adopted by leading private equity ﬁrms (Acharya et al. 2013) where
top management team and board strategize together: often in highly complementary
ways and based upon cash-ﬁnanced equity-centric alignment of interests (as opposed
to ‘free’ call options). PE is more of a governance than a ﬁnancing model, explaining
its public-market-equivalent outperformance (Harris et al. 2014).
According to Rindova (1999), board directors do impact decision-making in form
of three varieties: external, requisite, and representative. “Directors’ contribution as
a source of requisite variety is to increase the pool of available interpretative
frameworks on which the decision group can draw.” However, Rindova does not
open the black box of how this variety of interpretative frameworks on an individual
level transmorphs into an interpretation shared at the organizational level, not least at
the lateral level of the board of directors.
Further, Rindova also treats environmental stimuli as objective reality—to be
sensed and make sense of—with ‘clever analysis preceding strategic action’. She
emphasizes absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal 1990), i.e., the board’s
‘problem-solving’ and ‘thinking through’ expertise ‘developed in primary occupa-
tions’. Rindova appreciates the dynamic nature of strategy process when she postu-
lates that board participation in strategic decision-making rises with increasing
environmental complexity and uncertainty. However, Rindova’s approach is rather
static as it falls short of connecting the board table to the rest of the organization and
interchangeably treats perception as interpretation. A Free Energy Governance lens
instantly exposes the obvious shortcomings.
Forbes and Milliken (1999), equally a seminal contribution, made an important
step toward opening the black box of the board’s strategy dynamics by focusing on
(thereto understudied) process variables linking demography and group processes/
behavior. Indeed, “the very existence of the board as an institution is rooted in the
wise belief that the effective oversight of an organization exceeds the capabilities of
3

any individual and that collective knowledge and deliberation are better suited to this
task”.
Forbes and Milliken’s contribution is relevant in three regards: (1) It is impossible
to meaningfully infer board performance from demographic variables in the absence
of a process model linking demography and output. (2) The board’s role as a group is
essentially a cognitive role, and therefore, a cognitive rather than behavioral per-
spective is critical to better understand the essence of board performance. (3) Effort
norms (i.e., intensity and cognitive resourcefulness of the task performance behav-
ior), cognitive conﬂicts (i.e., leveraging differences in perspective), and the use of
knowledge and skills are important process variables underlying board performance.
The dimension of effort norms cannot be stressed enough: the sheer presence of the
collective’s pool of competencies and experiences is rather meaningless unless
actively and purposefully exercised.
While parsimonious as a model, Forbes and Milliken fail to explain how cogni-
tive conﬂicts can be leveraged beyond board effectiveness but in service of ﬁrm
performance and survival. The model is structurally isolated from the rest of the
organization and therefore of limited value. More importantly, it treats input of data
and stimuli as a black box. Nonetheless, Forbes and Milliken have laid the founda-
tion for a conversation framing the cognitive and social dimensions of board
effectiveness (Westphal and Zajac 2013). To assess the potential for the board’s
strategic role, we must move beyond the ‘board table’ and into the organization.
Golden and Zajac (2001), in ‘When will boards inﬂuence strategy? Inclination x
power ¼ strategic change’, developed a power-centric model suggesting that “stra-
tegic change is signiﬁcantly affected by board demography and board processes”
and, more importantly, that “a board’s inclination for strategic change interacts with
a board’s power to affect change”. As with so many contributions in corporate
governance, they appear to be too commonsense to be worth undertaking the
research. Nonetheless, Golden and Zajac’s (2001) contribution is an important step
toward further developing Forbes and Milliken’s effort norms.
‘What are the particular conditions under which boards are more likely to think,
act, and decide independently and achieve strategic change?’ is Golden and Zajac’s
essential research question. Demographic variables such as board size and tenure,
average age of board members, and board diversity (here deﬁned as occupational
heterogeneity) affect strategic change curve-linearly. Too much or too little has
potentially a negative impact.
Further, the demographic variables are then related to board processes to deter-
mine attentional focus in terms of orientation on rather internal (exploitation) than
external issues (exploration). The relevance of ABV (Ocasio 1997) is put into
perspective. But, eventually, it all comes down to the board’s power, here deﬁned
as the board’s relative power over the CEO (Golden and Zajac 2001): “preferences
or inclinations may be an important initial condition, but power ampliﬁes the
observed effect of those preferences.” However, Golden and Zajac (2001) cannot
explain how the board (laterally) generates an inclination for strategic renewal in the
ﬁrst place. Demographic and procedural variables aside, the study fails to take into
consideration how the board formally and informally interacts with the organization
beyond the CEO.

Microfoundations of Strategic Governance

Therefore, board power remains a black box. The board’s relative power over the
CEO is a function of knowledge, informational ﬂows, and learning capability. To set
free the true cognitive and collective power of the board may be less a function of
demographic and procedural variables but the Chairman’s power and inclination to
foster a collective dialogue at the board level (lateral interaction to exercise strategic
control) and connect with the rest of the organization—beyond the CEO.
Essentially, there are three important conclusions to take forward from Golden
and Zajac (2001): (a) demographic and procedural variables impact strategic change
rather curve-linearly; (b) power relationships are critical to understanding the
‘impel vs. impede’ debate in strategic renewal; and (c) attentional focus and engage-
ment in terms of an Ocasioian linkage of cognition and structure (Ocasio 1997) are a
promising venue upon which to pursue future research.
How board conﬁgurations—deﬁned as a function of board diversity and concen-
tration in leadership (such as CEO also serving as Chairperson)—impact Upper
Echelon’s speed and breadth of strategic action is the central research focus of
Bongjin et al. (2009). This valuable contribution proposes a model linking board
conﬁgurations with TMT’s strategic action capability, moderated by environmental
dynamism and complexity: “board involvement in strategy can either enhance or
inhibit the speed and breadth of TMT strategic action capabilities, thereby directly
impacting ﬁrm performance”. Their contribution moves Golden and Zajac’s (2001)
power-centered approach to a more action-centric approach in the context of ﬁrm
performance rather than just limited to board impact.
But like with so many studies in corporate governance research, one may
question whether commonsense hypotheses are simply packaged into reasonable
research without necessarily providing business leaders with any new meaningful
practice-relevant insights. The world of governing strategic renewal is too complex
to make use of deterministic models. At best, those models provide a framework and
language that potentially improve the quality of Upper Echelon’s strategy design
deliberations. The need to move from supervised to unsupervised learning models
cannot be overstressed in this context.
Bongjin et al. (2009) rightly criticize the increasing involvement of regulators
imposing far-reaching rules governing board structure—particularly relating to
board diversity—that “may actually harm ﬁrm performance”. Following the 2008
ﬁnancial crisis—not too dissimilar from the aftermath of the dot-com crisis in 2000/
2001—policymakers went into regulatory overdrive. Indeed, corporate governance
‘best practices guidelines’ may rather fuel ‘governance inertia’ than freeing the
board as an impactful variable supporting continuous strategic renewal.
In this context, Hoppmann et al.’s (2019) research is insightful:
[B]y highlighting boards as a source of inertia, our study also challenges existing ﬁndings in
the literature on strategic management, which suggests that the main reasons for organiza-
tional inertia are biased managerial cognition, a lack of incentive to change, or difﬁculties in
redeploying ﬁrm resources [. . .]. Given that boards have the power to initiate strategic
changes and replace managers, such inertia at lower organizational levels might not be
problematic per se if the board notices and deals with it. Therefore, our ﬁndings suggest that
an additional – and potentially more fundamental – source of organizational inertia lies in a
3

29

lack of self-evaluation and self-reconﬁguration that prevents boards from renewing their
ability to judge strategic issues.
Hoppmann et al. (2019) make an invaluable contribution in moving away from
deterministic models that suggest which speciﬁc board conﬁgurations and leadership
concentrations enhance board effectiveness, ﬁrm performance, and a ﬁrm’s overall
strategic capability. Instead, they focus on the board’s meta-capabilities such as self-
evaluation and self-reconﬁguration to power continuous strategic renewal: “[T]he
board’s power vis-à-vis management is strongly related to the board chair, who
initiates self-evaluation and self-reconﬁguration, thereby ensuring that the board can
still critically evaluate strategic proposals and reconﬁgure strategies.”
Unfortunately, though, Hoppmann et al. (2019) do not go far enough since
successful strategic renewal remains bottlenecked by the board chair. We need
governance processes that neutralize the overdependencies on Chairman and CEO.
Hence, cross-hierarchical connectivity—in terms of Upper Echelon listening
channels of bottom-up stimuli emerging for top-down prediction-processing—is
fundamental. While corporate governance research must be less deterministic and
more meta-capabilities inspired (i.e., DC)—as advocated by Hoppmann et al.
(2019)—there is a need to establish ﬁrst-order governing principles such as free
energy minimization. In the absence thereof, corporate governance research remains
conﬁned to Upper Echelon and trapped in “universally prescribed board conﬁgura-
tions” (Bongjin et al. 2009) breeding inertia.
The “nature, extent, and consequences of board involvement in strategy remain
elusive” (Bongjin et al. 2009). Indeed, the very limitations of corporate governance
research may be an astute reﬂection of the very real and often self-inﬂicted limita-
tions of the board’s strategic role. Shareholders are challenged to ensure that the
board of directors’ full (strategic) potential is not wasted. More speciﬁcally, we need
governance models that focus on reconﬁguring the ﬁrm as a generative and infer-
ential model of its eco-niche, governed by ﬁrst-order principles.
The top-down cultivated hierarchical disconnect so characteristic of traditional
corporate governance and strategy processes is more likely to fuel prediction error,
reinforcing the perception that the world is unpredictable and uncertain. Indeed, “we
are leaving the age of organized organizations and moving into an era where the
ability to understand, facilitate, and encourage processes of self-organization will
become a key competence” (Morgan 1993).
Friston’s free energy principle is laying the foundation for the multi-intelligence
ﬁrm’s self-organization: thinking born in curiosity, revolt, and change.

Chapter 4
Free Energy Principle (FEP)
Abstract The ‘free energy principle’ (FEP) is a ﬁrst-order principle of ‘least action’,
empowering self-organization. FEP commands the generative process of active
inference (Ai) dedicated to minimizing the (information-theoretical) mathematical
difference between top-down predictions and action-generated bottom-up stimuli—
in pursuit of minimizing error, surprise, and entropy. The power of Fristonian Ai is
fundamentally fourfold: (1) it is a pure belief-based setting in dynamic and non-
stationary environments; (2) the Ai agent carries out epistemic exploration to
account for uncertainty by making inferences in Bayes-optimal fashion; (3) the
reward signal so characteristic of reinforcement learning is removed; and, ﬁnally,
(4) Ai sets free the collaborative human-machine AI potential so integral to the
multi-intelligence ﬁrm as the mathematical expression of beliefs in form of proba-
bilities provides the very common denominator to align humans with machines.
There are only two distinctions that matter: ‘what is known and unknown’ and ‘what
is in our control and what is not’. There are four states: active (action), internal (ﬁrm
resources), sensory (perception), and external (unknown and hidden behind the
Markov blanket). According to Free Energy Governance (FEG), free energy
principle-powered Ai is the future site of organizational becoming.
In summary, (i) agents resist a natural tendency to disorder by minimizing a free energy
bound on surprise; (ii) this entails acting on the environment to avoid surprises, which
(iii) rests on making Bayesian inferences about the world. In this view, the Bayesian brain
ceases to be a hypothesis, it is mandated by the free energy principle; free energy is not used
to ﬁnesse perception, perceptual inference is necessary to minimize free energy. This
provides a principled explanation for action and perception that serve jointly to suppress
surprise or prediction error. (Friston 2009; emphasis by DBK)
The ‘free energy principle’ (FEP) is a ﬁrst-order principle—it is not a theory but
conforms to the principle of ‘least action’: “One could argue that nearly all physical
sciences can be reduced to a metrology in service of conﬁrming a variant of the
principle of least action [. . .] This is important because it means that physics does not
offer any ground truth—it is just a search for measurements that endorse an
appropriately formulated prediction based upon a variational principle” (Friston
2019).

FEP, hence, has no purpose of its own. It powers the generative process of
active (enactive) inference (Ai) that is dedicated to minimizing the (information-
theoretical) mathematical difference between top-down predictions and action-
generated bottom-up stimuli—in pursuit of minimizing error, surprise, and entropy
(for the latest comprehensive introduction to Ai see Parr et al. 2022). Variational free
energy and thermodynamic free energy are inversely related: if (variational) free
energy is high, “then thermodynamic entropy (e.g., energy not available for doing
productive work) will be high and thermodynamic free energy (e.g., energy available
for doing productive work) will be low” (Fox 2021).
The power of Fristonian Ai is fundamentally fourfold: (1) It is a pure belief-based
setting in dynamic and non-stationary environments. (2) The Ai agent carries out
epistemic exploration to account for uncertainty by making inferences in Bayes-
optimal fashion. (3) The reward signal so characteristic of reinforcement learning is
removed and replaced with one sole purpose: suprise-minimization. Effectively, the
agent is empowered to minimize surprise by way of a generative model of the
partially observable world: only perceiving “itself and the world via outcomes”
(Noor et al. 2021). (4) Ai should provide the basis to set free the collaborative
human-machine AI potential so integral to the multi-intelligence ﬁrm. The mathe-
matical expression of beliefs in form of probabilities may provide the very common
denominator to ‘align the actions of humans and machines’ (Fox 2021). This
Ai-based common denominator is a new language, and according to FEG, it is the
future site of organizational becoming:
In active inference, the agent makes choices based on its beliefs about these states of the
world and not based on the value of the states (Friston et al., 2016). This distinction is key: in
standard model-based reinforcement learning frameworks, the agent is interested in opti-
mizing the value function of the states (Sutton & Barto, 1998) that is, making decisions that
maximize expected value. In active inference, we are interested in optimizing a free energy
functional of beliefs about states, that is, making decisions that minimize expected free
energy. (Noor et al. 2021)
As the focus shifts from maximizing ‘expected value’ to optimizing ‘a free energy
functional of beliefs about states’, an important question, however, arises: how do
we properly ascribe conﬁdence to beliefs? That’s where precision comes into play:
“[T]he Bayesian brain has to optimize not just its expectations – it also has to
optimize precision. This means that one has to predict how much precision is
afforded to various sources of sensory evidence relative to prior beliefs” (Friston
2019). Precision determines reliability of sensory input. Optimization is central to
Ai. Certain sensory input may be encoded as salience providing affordance without
additional computational investment.
In this context and for the purposes of understanding Free Energy Governance
(FEG), it is important to retain that FEG is about optimization that engages all the
precision-sponsoring sources of (enacted) sensory evidence at any given point in
time, optimally leveraging knowledge retained through prior experience but without
missing the silent but nonetheless dissonance-bearing signals empowering us to
evolve our very generative model. Salience must be continuously fertlized by
double-loop learning.

Free Energy Principle (FEP)

When dynamics change, salience should be prevented from potentially increasing
free energy. In the context of corporate governance, one may think of ‘pattern
recognition’ as one form of salience. The more senior and experienced board
members are, the more likely that they feel comfortable with mental shortcuts such
as pattern recognition built through prior experience. It is a form of prior-biased
heuristics or, too often simply, deliberate ignorance (Hertwig and Engel 2020).
However, in a discontinuously ‘non-repeat game environment’, pattern recognition
without maintaining sensitivity for small but nonetheless transformative variations
puts survival at risk. Therefore, we need a process and a measure of error that
optimizes survival: hence, action-centric free energy minimization powering
enactive Ai.
In the Preface, we alluded to sophistication, which is about optimally deploying
the available computational power—in terms of precision as well as timing: “only
the sophisticated agent can see past the short-term pain for the long-term gain”
(Friston et al. 2021). A sophisticated agent has beliefs about beliefs, focusing on the
‘sequences of belief states as opposed to states per se’. This substantially enhances
the conﬁdence in the selection of actions and consequently narrows down the
number of potential paths to consider for prediction error minimization.
[I]n the navigation example, there were ﬁve actions and 64 hidden states, leading to a large
number of potential paths (1.0486  1010 for a planning horizon of four and 1.0737  1015 for
a planning horizon of six). However, only a tiny fraction of these paths is actually evalu-
ated—usually several hundred, which takes a few hundred milliseconds on a personal
computer. Given reasonably precise beliefs about current states and state transitions, only
a small number of paths are eligible for evaluation. (Friston et al. 2021)
Free Energy Governance (FEG) effectively transposes the Ai framework to the
ﬁrm and adopts FEP as a ﬁrst-order principle underlying a new logic of organizing
built around three core dimensions: structure (hierarchy), cognition (environmental
enactment), and capabilities (sensing and sensemaking). The framework is centered
around cross-hierarchical generative processes of sensing and sensemaking to insti-
tutionalize continuous strategic renewal as a matter of enactive inference in pursuit
of ﬁrm outperformance and survival.
In analogy to active inference, FEG is “a uniﬁed account of action, perception
and learning” (Friston 2010) embracing strategic renewal as a circularly causal
top-down/bottom-uplearningsystem dedicated to purpose-drivenand action-generated
predictions, prediction error minimization, and the continuous updating of prediction
models through double-loop learning.
“Single-loop learning occurs when errors are detected and corrected without
altering the governing values of the master program. Double-loop learning occurs
when, in order to correct an error, it is necessary to alter the governing values of the
master programs” (Argyris 2005; emphasis by DBK). Most governance models are
at best single-loop (rule-based) learning systems but struggle to activate double-loop
learning. Consequently, both generative and recognition models only evolve slug-
gishly, if ever:
Unlearning seems to be a distinctly social phenomenon, and it may be predominantly
organizational. [. . .] The need for unlearning arises from ways organizations typically differ
from individual people: (a) Organizations rely on action generators, which add inertia and

impede reﬂection, (b) Organizations emphasize explicit justiﬁcation, which rigidiﬁes and
perfects their rationality, (c) To facilitate documentation and communication, organizations
use perceptual categories that destroy subtlety and foster simpliﬁcation. (Starbuck 1983)
Indeed, once we understand the brain as a high-energy-powered (Bayesian/
inferential) probability processing engine, it is an ambitious or sheer realistically
utopic target for any organization to approximate Bayesian efﬁciency. In fact, we are
tasking the ﬁrm to mastermind survival by developing institutionalized shortcuts
through smart modeling and a rich repertoire of prior experiences facilitating the
action-centric and top-down/bottom-up generative processing of beliefs (i.e., prob-
abilities) within ‘a bounded set of states with a high probability’:
The FEP [Free Energy Principle] stems from the idea that living systems can be distin-
guished from other self-organising systems because they actively avoid deleterious phase-
transitions by bounding the entropy of their sensory and physical states – under the FEP, to
be alive simply means to revisit a bounded set of states with a high probability. (Badcock
et al. 2019)
Social ﬁelds are not as real-time as electrically charged and chemically powered
neural responsiveness. But the underlying logic and principles, nonetheless, deter-
mine ﬁrm performance and survival. All living self-organizing systems, as is true for
organizations, strive to reduce entropy in pursuit of minimizing surprise. But
organizations, other than living systems, are too often trapped in what Argyris
(1995) termed ‘skilled incompetence’, meaning that organizations are programmed
to deal with error and “threat in ways that are counterproductive to their own
intentions”, not least because organizations struggle with unlearning and deliberately
suppress subtlety.
Experiments in computer gaming have demonstrated the superiority of the ‘free
energy agent’ crystalizing the limitations of purely ‘reward-pursuing’ strategy
approaches that are overly dependent on ‘repeat-game experience’ (established
priors) compared to those that are designed to simply minimize surprise in form of
generative top-down/bottom-up prediction error minimization.
In late 2017, a group led by Rosalyn Moran, a neuroscientist and engineer at King’s College
London, pitted two AI players against one another in a version of the 3D shooter game
Doom. The goal was to compare an agent driven by active inference to one driven by reward
maximization. The reward-based agent’s goal was to kill a monster inside the game, but the
free energy-driven agent only had to minimize surprise. The Fristonian agent started off
slowly. But eventually it started to behave as if it had a model of the game, seeming to
realize, for instance, that when the agent moved left, the monster tended to move to the
right. After a while, it became clear that even in the toy environment of the game, the reward-
maximizing agent was ‘demonstrably less robust’; the free energy agent had learned
its environment better. It outperformed the reinforcement-learning agent because it was
exploring. (Raviv 2018)
FEP embraces the brain as a hierarchically deterministic structure fueled by
top-down/bottom-up generative processes: “a Bayesian hierarchy of ‘hypotheses’
or ‘best guesses’ about the hidden causes of our sensory states” (Badcock et al.
2019). This captures the structural dimension of Ai and equally that of FEG.
36
4
Free Energy Principle (FEP)

[T]he lowest or most peripheral levels of the cortical hierarchy comprise relatively segre-
gated, highly specialised neural mechanisms responsible for sensorimotor processing
(‘domain-speciﬁc’ systems), while its higher, deeper or more central layers consist of
developmentally plastic, highly integrated (‘domain-general’) mechanisms. The latter are
widely distributed subsystems that respond ﬂexibly to input received from multiple lower
levels, feed information downstream for further processing, and underlie the executive
cognitive functions unique to humans. (Badcock et al. 2019; emphasis by DBK)
To embrace both strategic renewal and corporate governance as an Ai-based
surprise minimization process requires continuous and generative interaction
between top-down predictions (strategic decision making, domain-general) and
bottom-up (business unit/resource market level, domain-speciﬁc) action-generated
stimuli, in circular causality. Free Energy Governance is fundamentally redeﬁning
the logic of coupling governance and operational channels.
Ai is enactivist. An enactivist environmental engagement (cognition) constitutes
FEG’s second dimension:
According to this emerging class of models, naturally intelligent systems do not passively
await sensory stimulation. Instead, they are constantly active, trying to predict (and actively
elicit, [. . .]) the streams of sensory stimulation before they arrive. Before an input arrives on
the scene, these pro-active cognitive systems are already busy predicting its most probable
shape and implications. Systems like that are already (pretty much constantly) poised to act,
and all they need to process are sensed deviations from the predicted state. [. . .] Action is not
so much a ‘response to an input’ as a neat and efﬁcient way of selecting the next input,
driving a rolling cycle. (Clark 2016)
Environment is en-acted in form of purpose-directed (prediction model centric)
and curiosity-driven sensory revealing of signiﬁcance and valency by way of
sophisticatedly propagating beliefs about beliefs’ consequences. This leads to the
Markov blanket: a learning algorithm, a veil intermediating the internal and external
worlds, within and without ﬁrms. The Markov blanket is the site where action and
perception circularly and generatively interact to update beliefs. The relevance and
insightfulness of applying the ‘blanket’ to an organizational setting, precisely in the
context of strategic renewal, is to embrace the ﬁrm-environment interrelatedness in
form of a veil propagating and updating beliefs (i.e., probability distributions):
One needs to differentiate between the system and its environment—those states that
constitute or are intrinsic to the system and those that are not. To do this, we have to
introduce a third set of states that separates internal from external states. This is known as a
Markov blanket. Markov blankets establish a conditional independence between internal and
external states that renders the inside open to the outside, but only in a conditional sense (i.e.,
the internal states only ‘see’ the external states through the ‘veil’ of the Markov blanket).
[. . .] With Markov blankets in mind, it is fairly straightforward to show that the internal
states must—by virtue of minimising surprise—encode a probability distribution over the
external states; namely, the causes of sensory impressions on the Markov blanket. (Ramstead
et al. 2018)1
1Bruineberg and Hesp (2018: 38) outline limitations to Ramstead et al.’s (2018) broad interpretation
of the Markov blanket.
4
Free Energy Principle (FEP)
37

The boundaries between organization and environment are increasingly ﬂuid,
non-deterministic but probabilistic. It comes back to the question ‘what constitutes a
system?’ as a basis for establishing Markovian boundaries, separating the internal
and external states.
“Many investigators deﬁne boundaries of an organization by focusing on its
actors – for example, attempting to determine who is and who is not regarded as a
member [. . .] A widely used behavioral indicator of relatedness is frequency of
interaction. Although no social unit is completely separated from its environment on
the basis of this criterion [...] A third possibility is to focus on the nature of the
activities performed [. . .] organizational boundaries are coterminous with activity
control” (Scott and Davis 2007). “The organization ends where its discretion ends,
and another’s begins” (Pfeffer and Salancik 1978).
In terms of FEG’s application of the free energy principle, there are only two
fundamental distinctions that matter: ‘what is known and unknown’ and ‘what is in
our control and what is not’. Once the mathematical rigor of Ai is applied, the
cohesiveness of the FEP-powered generative model emerges. We have four states:
active (action), internal (ﬁrm resources), sensory (perception), and external
(unknown and hidden behind the Markov blanket). As outlined in the Preface,
these are the four critical variables that deﬁne the generative as well as recognition
model. Both models are distinct but dynamically linked.
Effectively, ‘internally encoding a probability distribution over the external
states’ is the essence of the Markov blanket. A Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP) “is a mathematical framework for modeling decision
making in situations where the outcomes are partly under the control of an agent and
partly random [. . .] the agent must maintain a probability distribution over the set of
possible states” (Fox 2021). Each living system has a distinct probability distribution
over a bounded (most probable) set of external states. And our explorative interac-
tions with the outer world are fundamental to continuously optimizing this proba-
bility distribution through epistemic foraging. Essentially, existence and reality can
only be deﬁned in relation to and interaction with something else:
If the ﬁne grain of the world is made of material particles that have mass and motion, it seems
difﬁcult to reconstruct our perceiving and thinking complexity from this amorphous grain.
But if the ﬁne grain of the world is better described in terms of relations, if nothing has
intrinsic properties except in relation to other things, perhaps in this physics we can better
ﬁnd elements able to combine in a comprehensible way, to be the basis of those complex
phenomena that we call our perceptions and our consciousness. (Rovelli 2021)
Environment in form of ‘external states’ is ﬁrst and foremost a matter of ‘inter-
nally encoding a probability distribution over external states’. Fundamentally, FEG
is about continuously challenging and ﬁne-tuning this probability distribution in
pursuit of ‘proximal avoidance of surprise’. It is obvious to see that the quality of our
Markov blanket in terms of probability distributions and underlying interactions
with the outer world in pursuit of optimization critically determines whether the
world is perceived as uncertain and unpredictable or whether perception is embraced
as a function of our very actions generatively minimizing prediction error. We are in
control!

Free Energy Principle (FEP)

FEG’s third building block is dedicated to capabilities. Once we have
(1) established cross-hierarchical top-down/bottom-up connectivity (structure) and
(2) internalized environment as conditioned by the Markov blanket (cognition), the
ﬁrm is now challenged to optimize resource reconﬁguration to resist the forces of
disorder to optimize the survival prospects. The concept of dynamic board capabil-
ities is introduced—more speciﬁcally, duality management in terms of ‘real-time’
balancing exploitation vs. exploration and ﬁnancial vs. strategic control.
FEP as a ﬁrst-order principle is essential to operationalizing dynamic capabilities,
which is about empowering a ﬁrm to operate in new, complex, and discontinuous
environments where established operational capabilities and reward functions may
be of little value. Julie Pitt, Director of Data Science Platform at Netﬂix, puts the free
energy minimization model into operational perspective and effectively summarizes
the very essence of a dynamic capability:
[T]he beauty of the free energy model is that it allows an artiﬁcial agent to act in any
environment, even one that’s new and unknown. Under the old reinforcement-learning
model, you’d have to keep stipulating new rules and sub-rewards to get your agent to
cope with a complex world. But a free energy agent always generates its own intrinsic
reward: the minimization of surprise. [That] reward includes an imperative to go out and
explore. (Raviv 2018; emphasis by DBK)
Free energy minimization is introduced “for the ultimate integration of the life
sciences and social sciences under one unifying principle” (Bruineberg and Hesp
2018). Nonetheless, Veissière’s critical note below demands putting into perspective
FEP’s underlying imperative of ‘be curious, explore, and act’ as “social organization
can only survive in the longterm if there is sufﬁcient space between existential limits
to allow for exploration” (Fox 2021):
Social scientists, at least since Weber, have often lamented the human cost of bureaucrati-
zation and rationalization, but these dynamics have rarely been theorized as natural conse-
quences of free energy minimization. Rather than propose a weird metaphysics of
autonomous, self-organizing ‘societies’, however, social and cognitive scientists should
mind the cognitive gap, and remember that the ‘culprit’, if there is one, is none other than
the simplicity-craving, free energy-minimizing human mind. For the rest, we can also
celebrate the many human traditions in spirituality, the humanities, and the Arts that have
emphasized the importance of doubt, uncertainty, novelty, and unknowability. In the end, it
may very well be these propensities to resist free energy minimization that make us humans.
(Veissière 2018)
In fact, Weberian bureaucratization is a top-down formalistic system that
increases rather than minimizes free energy. Today, organizations are challenged
to optimize top-down belief propagation and bottom-up signal ﬂow throughout the
organization, across and within all hierarchical layers. Informal ﬂows of communi-
cation are at least as important as what the formal structures impose. Prediction error
minimization is only as good as effective the circular causality of action, perception,
belief propagation, and, most crucially, optimization of belief-updating are.
FEP is not simplicity-craving but empowers a system to exploit uncertainty and
complexity in pursuit of performance and survival by way of curiosity-driven
epistemic foraging and exploration. Correspondingly, Free Energy Governance
4
Free Energy Principle (FEP)
39

(FEG) is a next-generation learning system designed for a discontinuous world,
de-chaining the ﬁrm from dominant top-down logics and empowering continuous
strategic renewal through purpose-directed generative, inferential, and cross-
hierarchical prediction error minimization.
Contrary to Veissière (2018), FEP empowers doubt, novelty-seeking curiosity,
and embraces perceived uncertainty as a source rich in information to power
prediction error minimization. More speciﬁcally, the very information that powers
free energy minimization has a ‘social life’ (Brown and Duguid 2017)—active
inference implies an active engagement with the world.
Are there any imperatives that live beyond FEP?
Over the past decade or so, I have seen nearly every heuristic or hypothesis fall under the
remit of the free-energy principle, from self-organisation to neural hermeneutics,
from reinforcement learning to Bayesian decision theory, from perception to attention,
from exploration to exploitation, from pragmatics to epistemics, from novelty to salience,
from morphogenesis to evolution, from motor control theory to expected utility theory [. . .]
and so on. [. . .] Is this something to be celebrated or resisted? (Friston 2019)
It is overdue for the free energy principle to be applied to strategy management
and inspire novel processes as well as a new language empowering multi-
intelligence ﬁrms to thrive in discontinuous and distributed market environments.
FEP lays the foundation to re-deﬁne entrenched notions of structure, cognition, and
capabilities in the context of governing strategic renewal.
In short, we expect to be surprised in a world that is predictably unpredictable - and this is the
very stuff of free-energy minimization. (Friston et al. 2018)

Conclusion
Abstract Strategic renewal research is now confronted with important challenges
concerning process design, cognition, and dynamic capabilities. Sensing and
sensemaking of relevant signals as a basis for initiating strategic renewal are
preceded by an action-centric and explorative engagement with the world. We are
moving from co-aligning organization with environment in form of adaptation to
co-creation as ﬁrms build agility through distinctive environmental enactment. All
existing frameworks and studies in corporate governance as well as strategic cogni-
tion remain characterized by one or a combination of the following fundamental
limitations: (1) environment and environmental change are generally treated as
objective reality; (2) strategic renewal is treated as a top-down ‘content’ rather
than a top-down/bottom-up ‘process challenge’; (3) strategic renewal is studied at
the managerial level but only marginally at the board level; (4) formal processes only
are the focal unit of analysis; and (5) demographic and universally measurable
variables dominate with no due consideration for strategy-relevant meta-capabilities
at the board level. FEG introduces a novel cross-hierarchical generative (inference
centric) framework empowering the ﬁrm as a generative model of its eco-niche.
Shareholders and board directors must reinterpret the board’s ‘strategic relevance’ in
a discontinuous world. If not, the board is prone to turn into (or remain) a source of
inertia compromising ﬁrm performance and survival.

through distinctive environmental enactment (Weick 1995; Agarwal and Helfat
2009; Schmitt et al. 2016). Consequently, strategic renewal is not so much an
isolated event or project of choice but a continuous and cross-hierarchically gener-
ative social process that is integral to a ﬁrm’s way of becoming or organizing, i.e.,
survival.

In a discontinuous world, we are moving from a ‘hard’ to a ‘soft’ operating logic
where ﬂuidity and agility (vacillating/balancing duality) and informal structures
(Gulati and Puranam 2009) increasingly determine ﬁrm performance and survival:
“[H]ighly centralized and formalized structures are doomed to be ineffective and
irrational in that they waste the organization’s most precious resource: the intelli-
gence and initiative of its participants” (Scott and Davis 2007). There is a need for an
integrated cross-hierarchical framework that is less reliant on structural compart-
mentalization. Further, there is a need to redeﬁne what precisely is the top, i.e.,
Upper Echelon. Top-down/bottom-up connectivity is of relevance within each and
every horizontal layer.
Indeed, if in a discontinuous and distributed world ﬁrm performance and survival
are increasingly determined by cognitive dimensions, we are challenged to explain:
(1) What determines that “the organization comes to be constituted as an actor with a
point of view and identity that transcend that of any of its members, singly”
(Taylor and Van Every 2000)? Unless enacted at the organizational level, there
are only individual waves of probabilities in superposition waiting to be
collapsed.
(2) What speciﬁc structure, cognition, and capabilities determine for bottom-up
stimuli (sensory input) to dynamically connect to top-down strategic decision
processes (predictions and prediction models) so that seemingly marginal and
transient data points are empowered to provide relevant and potentially trans-
formation-bearing insights?
(3) What if the default-mode sensemaking of bottom-up signals is a critical cogni-
tive capability underpinning strategic renewal, should the board of directors—
rather than TMT—be uniquely positioned in developing and exercising such a
capability since the board is assumed to be less trapped in a given ﬁrm’s
dominant logics (Prahalad and Bettis 1986), core rigidities (Leonard-Barton
1992), and task-positive frames of exploitation?
Conversations in strategic cognition, corporate governance, and theoretical neu-
robiology are waiting to be cross-fertilized. The Carnegie School’s “triplet of
routines, cognition, and hierarchy” (Gavetti 2005) is developed and advanced in
this book as the triplet of structure, cognition, and capabilities, linked in circular
causality.
In summary, the problem analysis is threefold:
•
Structure: While pace of change in terms of increasing velocity has been a
constant feature of a globalized world, in fact of any organized economic activity
over time, probabilities of environmental states are increasingly of a distributed
and discontinuous nature. Continuous strategic renewal is the new organizing
imperative. Initiating strategic renewal within centralized organizational struc-
tures for a distributed world, however, challenges entrenched models of organiz-
ing. “In the current environment, where human capital is crucial and contracts are
highly incomplete, the primary goal of a corporate governance system should be
to protect the integrity of the ﬁrm, and new precepts need to be worked out”
44

Conclusion

(Zingalis 2000). Strategy process requires a circular and cross-hierarchical frame-
work: neither can the strategic role of the board of directors be ignored nor should
the ﬁeld-level’s proximity to resource markets be disregarded as a critical pillar of
strategy process. “There is room for a fresh perspective on how organizational
structures, processes and systems should be designed to enable both induced
[top-down] and autonomous [bottom-up] renewal initiatives”. (Schmitt et al.
2018). Top-down/bottom-up surprise/prediction-error-minimization will deter-
mine a ﬁrm’s structural design, enabling generative processes that optimize
ﬁrm performance and survival. Indeed, the traditional top-down coupling of
governance and operational channels (Ocasio and Joseph 2005) requires a fresh
perspective.
•
Cognition: Conceiving organizing (becoming) as a system of generatively evolv-
ing beliefs in form of expectations, interpretations, and perceptions is essential to
embracing environment as ‘shared expectation’ to be enacted rather than an
objective reality to analytically adapt to. If not, executive leadership as well as
the board of directors will be rather incapacitated as uncertainty and
unpredictability will not only dominate perception and predictions but also trap
sensemaking. Consequently, the very ability to continuously renew the business
strategically will be compromised. The ﬁrm’s self-identity as an action-centric
and curiosity-driven enactor of its eco-niche by way of action-challenging beliefs
about the unknown (probability distributions assigned upon the outer world)
forms the very basis for mastering discontinuities.
•
Capabilities: Against this background, we must turn toward capabilities and
question whether traditional capabilities centered around operational and domain
expertise only (Dane 2010; Almondoz and Tilcsik 2016) are sufﬁciently adequate
to support ﬁrm performance and survival in a discontinuous world. Cognitive
capabilities such as sensing, sensemaking, and duality management become
increasingly critical to cross-fertilize exploitation and exploration as well as
strategic and ﬁnancial control (i.e., a ﬁrm’s capacity for internal vs. external
innovation/growth). As cognitive capabilities rise in their complementary rele-
vance to operational capabilities and domain expertise, the question arises
whether the board represents a unique cognitive variable in strategy process.
Referring
to
Hitt
et
al.
(1996)
and
their
proposed
tension
ﬁeld
of
strategic vs. ﬁnancial control, we must ask whether the board of directors is
uniquely positioned to govern the balance between top-down ﬁnancial control
(i.e., reliance on M&A and other forms of strategic alliancing) and strategic
control (i.e., in-house-generated innovation powered by R&D) to optimize
resource reconﬁguration as a matter of free energy minimization.
The organizational design considerations emerging in this context are putting into
new perspective how structure, cognition, and capabilities are dynamically related.
Indeed, in a discontinuous world, structural compartmentalization may reach its
limits when it comes to cross-fertilizing exploitation and exploration. Cognitive
‘vacillation’ (Boumgarden et al. 2012) gains in traction. Firms have to become

less dependent upon structural reorganizations as it could compromise the
impactfulness and sustainability of continuous strategic renewal.
All existing frameworks and studies in corporate governance as well as strategic
cognition remain characterized by one or a combination of the following fundamen-
tal limitations:
(1) Environment and environmental change are generally treated as objective/
exogenously determined reality to be sensed, made available for sensemaking
(interpretation), and adapt to (resource reconﬁguration). Accordingly, traditional
top-down information processing and adaptive capabilities as well as domain
expertise take center stage, however, too often at the expense of cognitive
capabilities fostering enactive inference as a basis for ﬁrm performance and
survival.
(2) Strategic renewal is treated as a top-down content rather than a top-down/
bottom-up process challenge: content follows process as much as strategy
follows structure and people. Generative processes linking in circular causality
top-down predictions with bottom-up stimuli—anchored in a deep corporate
purpose (Gulati 2022)—are essential to continuously generate relevant strategy
content and guide action agendas.
(3) Strategic renewal is studied at the managerial level but only marginally at the
board level. “[T]he role of the board remains unaddressed” (Oehmichen et al.
2017; referring to ambidexterity). And whenever strategic renewal is studied at
the board level, it is rather trapped within the ‘board room’ and disconnected
from the rest of the organization. Board effectiveness rather than ﬁrm perfor-
mance and survival remains the predominant ‘corporate governance’ concern. It
is essential to move from corporate to organizational governance to empower
continuous strategic renewal. ‘Corporate’ has a tendency of implying ‘top-
down’ and ‘formal’, emphasizing ﬁnancial control at the expense of top-down/
bottom-up prediction processing’s circular causality dedicated to ﬁrm survival.
(4) Formal processes are the focal unit of analysis as reﬂected in predominant ‘best
practices’ that consider informal engagement as suspicious of potentially breed-
ing conﬂicts of interests. Unavoidably, formality tends to reinforce friction and
increase free energy as only formalized data and stimuli can reach the prediction
generators, i.e., Upper Echelon. Hence, there is a need to de-formalize and
mentalize organizing.
(5) Demographic and universally measurable variables dominate with no due
consideration for strategy-relevant meta-capabilities at the board level. Conse-
quently, the board is reduced to a rather passively reactive and stimulus-intaking
organ far removed from the notion of purveyor and surveyor of the ﬁrm’s
generative model. Lastly, the board’s potential role in exercising the develop-
ment of strategy-relevant cognitive (dynamic) capabilities at the managerial
leadership level has been altogether disregarded.
While the board has signiﬁcant powers such as changing the CEO, its contribu-
tion throughout the strategic renewal process remains generally nonetheless moder-
ated by the power of the CEO, the Chairman, as well as the Chairman-CEO

relationship. Environmental dynamics and ownership structure—whether founder-,
family-, PE-controlled or publicly listed—certainly have a moderating impact on the
board’s strategic role. Public shareholders, however, are less reliably a driver of
strategic renewal unless survival is visibly at risk, which is often too late. Share-
holders and board directors must ﬁnally awake and re-interpret the board’s strategic
relevance in a discontinuous and distributed world. If not, the board is prone to turn
into (or remain) a source of inertia.
This book is dedicated to ﬁrm survival in discontinuous and distributed market
environments with the unit of analysis being the sustainability of continuous strate-
gic renewal determined by the triplet of a ﬁrm’s (1) structure (cognitive coupling of
governance and operational channels as a matter of top-down/bottom-up prediction
error minimization), (2) cognition (environmental enactment), and (3) dynamic
board capabilities (duality management of exploitation/exploration and ﬁnancial/
strategic control).
This new ‘extended’ conversation is headlined ‘Free Energy Governance’.

Free Energy Governance (FEG)
[T]heory is a statement of concepts and their interrelationships that shows how and/or why a
phenomenon occurs [. . .]. We believe, however, that a more productive question to ask, and
for us to address, is “What is a theoretical contribution?” That is, what signiﬁes a signiﬁcant
theoretical (as opposed to an empirical or a methodological) advancement in our under-
standing of a phenomenon?... Our synthesis reveals two dimensions—originality and util-
ity—that currently dominate considerations of theoretical contribution.
Thus, theory directed at practical importance would focus on prescriptions for structuring
and organizing around a phenomenon and less on how science can further delineate or
understand the phenomenon. . . Yet the reality is that, excepting some passionate calls for
change . . . practical utility’s role in theoretical contribution seems to receive mainly lip
service.
—Corley and Gioia (2011)
Free Energy Governance (FEG) introduces a novel cross-hierarchical generative
framework that uniquely applies the triplet of structure, cognition, and capabilities as
the building blocks of the ﬁrm’s generative model, speciﬁcally in the context of
continuous strategic renewal in distributed and discontinuous market environments.
Essentially, six core theoretical perspectives together lay the foundation for this
new conversation: Structure: (1) Upper Echelon View (UEV) and (2) Prediction
Processing Framework (PPF); Cognition: (3) Attention-Based View (ABV); (4)
Enactivist Approach (EA); Capabilities: (5) Dynamic Capability View (DCV);
and (6) Antagonistic Neural Networks Perspective (ANNP).
Structure, cognition, and capabilities form one integrated system under FEG.
Failure in any one domain is likely to challenge ﬁrm survival. The framework’s core
propositions, outlined at the end of this chapter, summarize FEG’s ambition for a
practice-relevant theoretical contribution as both a generative logic of organizational
governance as well as an early-warning system predicting corporate decay.

Structure: Synergizing Governance
and Operational Channels
Abstract Upper Echelon View (UEV) and Prediction Processing Framework
(PPF) address FEG’s structural dimension. Indeed, Upper Echelon is the site of
strategic decision-making. However, UEV suffers from several limitations. There is
no explicit consideration for the board of directors and the linkage of Upper Echelon
into the rest of the organization, i.e., the coupling of governance and operational
channels, is unidirectionally top-down and therefore, at best, incomplete. How the
ﬁeld data can systematically talk to Upper Echelon and inﬂuence their values,
perception, and attention remains a black box. The prediction processing framework
(PPF) embraces structure more holistically, addressing the hierarchical disconnect
and, more importantly, the circular causality between top-down predictions and
bottom-up stimuli. Dissonance-bearing messages occur at the ﬁrm’s stimuli level
(bottom) close to resource markets long before top leadership has ‘any sense’ of a
looming challenge. PPF is determined by three ‘categorical imperatives’: (1) Upper
Echelon’s prediction models and predictions must be ‘explainable’; (2) each of the
hierarchical layers must have formal and informal interfaces coupling each layer to
the next layer; and (3) the ﬁrm’s generative model is the ﬁrm’s eco-niche. PPF
provides an entirely new perspective and language embracing strategic renewal as a
matter of bottom-up/top-down prediction error minimization, not least setting free
the full potential of the human-machine interface.
6.1
Upper Echelon View (UEV)
Strategies are abstractions in the mind of managers [. . .] Indeed, the imposition of meaning
on issues characterized by ambiguity has become a hallmark of the modern top manager.
(Calori et al. 1994)
UEV (Hambrick and Mason 1984) deﬁnes the organization as a reﬂection of its
Upper Echelon, i.e., its top management team. UEV’s central premise is that
“executives’ experiences, values, and personalities affect their (1) ﬁeld of vision
(the directions they look and listen), (2) selective perception (what they actually see
and hear), and (3) interpretation (how they attach meaning to what they see and
hear)” (Hambrick 2007). Overall, the power of UEV is its aggregating nature: rather

51

than considering individual leadership qualities, top leadership is treated as one unit
of analysis to explain strategic choices and ﬁrm performance.
Essentially, UEV embraces sensing and sensemaking, not only as essential
leadership qualities but as the foundation for strategic choices and ﬁrm performance.
There are numerous studies that have applied or attempted to further develop UEV
by focusing on team diversity and CEO characteristics.1
We also know relatively little about how the interaction of cognitive capabilities of individ-
uals in the top management team affects team decision making, particularly with regard to
strategic change. Research has often used demographic diversity of top management teams
as a proxy for cognitive diversity, and has produced mixed results regarding the impact of
such diversity on organizational performance (Finkelstein et al., 2009: 132). Future research
could investigate whether diversity of managerial cognitive capabilities within a team helps
or hinders strategic change. (Helfat and Peteraf 2015)
However, UEV suffers from several limitations, in particular: (1) There is no
explicit consideration for the board of directors as part of Upper Echelon; the many
dimensions by which a non-executive Chairman relates to the CEO, for example, are
likely to determine strategic choices. (2) The linkage of Upper Echelon into the rest
of the organization, i.e., the coupling of governance and operational channels, is
unidirectionally top-down and therefore limited. How the ﬁeld data can systemati-
cally talk to Upper Echelon and inﬂuence their values, perception, and attention
remains a black box.
While UEV has neglected the board of directors, FEG emphasizes the importance
of the board as part of a ﬁrm’s Upper Echelon: TMT and the board of directors, here
jointly labeled as Upper Echelon, are together the locus of strategic decision-making.
More importantly, the board of directors can potentially assume a unique cognitive
role in strategy process in the form of dynamic board capabilities that is highly
complementary to that of senior executive leadership’s strategic capacity.
Further, UEV has neither addressed “the psychological and social processes by
which executive proﬁles are converted into strategic choices” (Hambrick 2007) nor
can UEV explain how strategic renewal is initiated. As a result, UEV is rather top-
down-centric and provides no systematic interface for bottom-up stimuli, neither
from within nor outside the organization. More speciﬁcally, the Upper Echelon
framework cannot accommodate the circular causality of top-down predictions and
bottom-up stimuli in pursuit of surprise minimization. Therefore, at best, it is
incomplete.
Indeed, while UEV’s central premise is about establishing a causal link between
senior executives’ characteristics and strategic action, Hambrick recognizes in his
‘Update’ (Hambrick 2007) that this can be a futile task, confusing causality with
consequences. UEV must be further developed against the propositions that (1) the
board’s strategic capacity (such as initiating strategic renewal) critically determines
1Georgakakis et al. (2014): “Despite the relevance of this topic, however, upper echelon studies
provide inconclusive results on the effects of diverse TMT composition on ﬁrm outcomes [...] To
overcome this inconsistency, upper echelons research should adopt approaches that simultaneously
consider both the drivers and consequences of TMT composition.”

ﬁrm performance and (2) strategic choices are a function of top-down/bottom-up
prediction processing and generative sensing and sensemaking (i.e., error minimi-
zation). Cognition and structure are inseparably linked.
Unless these limitations are addressed, UEV is far too restrictive and one-sided
(top-down) to explain through the lens of leadership qualities the anatomy of success
and failure of strategic renewal. This book invites to a new stream of UEV-centric
research that operationalizes UEV’s impact on ﬁrm performance not so much in
terms of ‘antecedents and consequences of team diversity’ but as a function of
(1) structure, cognitively coupling governance and operational channels in form of
top-down/bottom-up circular prediction error minimization; (2) cognition, embrac-
ing environment as a matter of action-centric enactment; and (3) capabilities, devel-
oping duality management as a dynamic board capability to rewire the plane while
ﬂying it.
At the ﬁrm level, Upper Echelon is a relevant unit of analysis: top-level pre-
dictions and underlying prediction models lay the foundation for purpose-directed
generative predictive processing. However, UEV has fallen short of linking Upper
Echelon cognition to the rest of the organization. Nonetheless, UEV provides an
essential foundation for Free Energy Governance (top-down). Above all, UEV must
be credited with providing a useful metaphor: Upper Echelon. But otherwise, it is
rather anti-clocked in its exclusive ‘top-down’ emphasis and misses the essential
‘bottom-up’ signal feedback loop optimizing Upper Echelon’s world models.
The prediction processing framework (PPF) allows us to embrace structure more
holistically.
6.2
Prediction Processing Framework (PPF)2
[Prediction error minimization theory] profoundly reverses how we conceive our relation to
the world through the senses. A standard conception is that the senses convey a rich signal
that somehow represents worldly states of affairs, which the brain is passively soaking up in
a bottom-up manner. If there is any top-down interpretation of the incoming data, then this is
mere feedback from the cognitive system on the key bottom-up signal. On the prediction
error minimization view, this picture is reversed. The rich representation of the worldly
states of affairs is signaled in the top-down predictions of sensory input, maintained by the
perceptual hierarchy in the brain. These predictions, as it were, query the world and dampen
down predicted sensory input. The result is that only prediction error is propagated up
through the system in a bottom-up fashion, and aids in revision of the model parameters. . .
The functional role of the bottom-up signal from the senses is then to be feedback on the
internal models of the world. (Hohwy 2013; emphasis by DBK)
2See Ramstead et al. (2020; emphasis by DBK): “Bayesian formulations, centred on the brain –
variously known as predictive processing, predictive coding or the prediction error
minimisation framework.”
6.2
Prediction Processing Framework (PPF)
53

Indeed, a more structural (representational) rather than enactive emphasis of
predictive processing (Bayesian inference) belongs to Hohwy (2013). The essence
of predictive processing (PP) has a long-standing tradition in various disciplines.
According to Swanson (2016), “[t]hemes from Kant active in PP include: (1) the
emphasis on ‘top-down’ generation of percepts; (2) the role of ‘hyperpriors’; (3) the
general function of ‘generative models’; (4) the process of ‘analysis-by-synthesis’;
and (5) the crucial role of imagination in perception.” Clark (2013) notes that “[s]uch
models follow Helmholtz (1860) in depicting perception as a process of probabilis-
tic, knowledge-driven inference. From Helmholtz comes the key idea that sensory
systems are in the tricky business of inferring sensory causes from their bodily
effects.” Overall, interest in PP is increasingly entering the mainstream (Raviv
2018).3
Drawing on Freud’s distinction of psychical energy as either freely mobile or
bound, Holmes (2020) has framed psychosis as a matter of impaired PP, i.e.,
compromised Ai, where free energy remains unbounded: “As Freud suggests,
what makes trauma traumatic is the piercing of the defensive shield that protects
the self, dividing the entropy of the external world from the living order within. […]
Psychological trauma hurts because painful “negative valence” […] arises in situa-
tions of chronic unminimized prediction error. Freud’s deﬁnition of trauma points to
an absence of top-down models with which to bind upcoming free energy” (Holmes
2020).
In fact, “[p]rediction error minimization uses models that generate data in a
top-down fashion rather than classify the bottom-up data” (Hohwy 2013). PP does
not require ‘labeled training data’ (Hohwy 2013). For the purposes of FEG, Hohwy’s
structural (representational) interpretation of predictive processing emphasizes the
critical importance of top-down/bottom-up connectivity in form of circular causality.
Neither governance nor strategic renewal research have addressed the hierarchical
disconnect of the top-down/bottom-up circular causality, certain exceptional contri-
butions aside (Floyd and Lane 2000; Crossan and Berdrow 2003; Dong et al. 2016;
Schmitt et al. 2018). PPF opens the processual black box of how shared meaning and
expectations are constructed and optimized in pursuit of optimizing the performance
and sustainability of strategic renewal. More importantly, we must ﬁrst recall how
hierarchical disconnect and managerial distortions have pervaded organizational
existence:
Hierarchies detach top managers from the realities that their subordinates confront, so top
managers' ideologies can diverge from the perceptions of low-level personnel [...] Top
managers' macroscopic points of view let them see more ideological elements than their
ideologies can incorporate, and their secondhand contact with most events and their spokes-
person roles encourage them to simplify and rationalize their ideologies (Axelrod, 1976).
Public statements encourage distortion while committing the speakers to their pronounce-
ments. (Starbuck 1983)

Structure: Synergizing Governance and Operational Channels

In fact, hierarchy-fostered reﬂexes and behaviors are likely to lead to ‘skilled
incompetence’. Therefore, strategic renewal is fundamentally about continuous
learning and un-learning. In management science, PPF’s epistemological origins
can be traced to Argyris’ theory of action perspective (Argyris 1976), speciﬁcally the
concept of ‘double-loop learning’ deﬁned as a form of “learning that challenges the
existing routines and status quo” (Argyris 2005). Action-centric learning is at the
heart of the cross-hierarchical prediction processing framework (PPF). Starbuck and
Milliken (1988) have captured the essence of the top-down/bottom-up challenge that
PPF is dedicated to resolve:
The inﬂuence of executives’ deﬁnitions of what matters may gain strength through the
uncoupling of executives’ decisions about what to observe from their subordinates’ acts of
perception. This uncoupling and the asymmetry of hierarchical communications impair
feedback, and so executives’ perceptions adapt sluggishly to the actual observations made
by their subordinates. Organizations encourage the creation of formalized scanning pro-
grams; they assign specialists to monitor foreground events, and they discourage subordi-
nates from reporting observations that fall outside their assigned responsibilities. Even when
subordinates do notice events that have been formally classiﬁed as background, they tend not
to report these upward, and superiors tend to ignore their subordinates’ messages. (Starbuck
and Milliken 1988)
Organizational attention is top-down-directed but must be challenged by bottom-
up data and action-generated stimuli, encouraging (un-)learning in form of
top-down/bottom-up circular error minimization. Bottom-up initiatives and stimuli
are routinely ﬁltered and time-delayed by organizational hierarchies, if they ever
reach the top: “Although some lower-level managers and engineers were acutely
aware of the electronic revolution in the world at large, this awareness did not
penetrate upward, and the advent of electronic calculators took Facit’s top managers
by surprise” (Starbuck 1983).
More importantly, corporate failures too often prove the fact that even if relevant
stimuli reach the top, they are unlikely to timely change predictions and underlying
prediction models. “Crises also bring unlearning when people discover that their
beliefs do not explain events, that their behavior programs are producing bad results,
that their superiors’ expertise is hollow. Although this unlearning clears the way for
new learning during reorientations, it so corrodes morale and trust that many organi-
zations cannot reorient” (Starbuck 1983). This is particularly true for (narcissistic)
CEO-centrism. There is a need for a fundamentally new organizing framework. A
system’s preparedness to unlearn (Bonchek 2016) powers “the receptivity to correc-
tive feedback of the decision-making unit” (Argyris 1976) and, hence, is critical to
PPF’s top-down/bottom-up learning (prediction error minimization) challenge.
Indeed, the entrenched top-down obsession to deterministically rationalize and
formalize strategy process leads ﬁrms to ‘destroy subtlety and foster simpliﬁcation’
at the expense of cultivating purpose-directed but unsupervised bottom-up sensing
capabilities. Our challenge is to minimize the potent fallibility of Upper Echelon by
re-distributing organizational sensing and sensemaking across the broadest possible
set of (intelligent) nodes, including machines, within and without the ﬁrm.
The challenge is to match the world’s distributed nature with organizational models
that are equally distributed in their sensing (i.e., stimuli-intaking) as well as
6.2
Prediction Processing Framework (PPF)
55

sensemaking (i.e., prediction processing and model updating) capacity. This is what
the multi-intelligence ﬁrm is about. But to optimize the human-machine interface and
interaction, we need a new framework, new concepts, and a new language. PPF has the
potential to leverage the ﬁrm’s broadest and deepest accessible bottom-up (resource
market) intelligence for organizational sensing and sensemaking as a basis for opti-
mizing prediction models and the very predictions those models generate. More
speciﬁcally, PPF lays the foundation for optimizing continuous strategic renewal.
Upper Echelon remains the centralized purveyor of predictions as well as trustee
of prediction models. Hence, the prediction processing-powered Free Energy Gov-
ernance framework is distributed at the bottom but centralized at the top. However,
for prediction error minimization to work, each hierarchical layer must be dedicated
to one simple ﬁrst-order principle: minimize free energy to minimize error and
surprise. Consequently, prediction models will generatively evolve by way of self-
learning. This is the essence of unsupervised self-organization.
PPF is a form of Bayesian inference. “This generative model is decomposed into
a likelihood (the probability of sensory data, given their causes) and a prior (the a
priori probability of those causes)” (Friston 2010). Equally, strategy process is about
assigning probabilities to a bounded set of selected external states in form of
predictions leveraging prior experience. “[U]nder the [FEP], to be alive simply
means to revisit a bounded set of states with a high probability” (Badcock et al.
2019). It is a continuous interplay “between raw data seeking an explanation
(bottom-up) and hypotheses seeking conﬁrmation (top-down)” (Clark 2016; quoting
Shipp 2005). The challenge is not only one of building intra-ﬁrm connections
between Upper Echelon’s top-down predictions and ﬁeld management’s bottom-
up stimuli (data) but optimizing the top-down/bottom-up process within each and
every layer of the hierarchy in form of feedback connections.
Optimization is central to PPF. “This optimization makes every level in the
hierarchy accountable to the others” (Friston 2010). While the generative
sensemaking processes and capabilities are a critical performance element at every
level of the hierarchy, the efﬁcacy of such capabilities is determined by top-down
belief propagation and bottom-up message-passing within and across organizational
layers or business units.
Embracing the brain as a probabilistic (Bayesian) prediction machine that gener-
ates actions to produce stimuli to eventually qualify or refute predictions and, if
necessary, adapt accordingly the underlying priors and prediction models may
analogously enrich our understanding of the circular causality deﬁning the relation-
ship of a ﬁrm’s structure, cognition, and capabilities in the context of strategic renewal.
This is the essence of sensemaking: the quest for optimizing the match between
worldview and ‘world stimuli’ through action-generated dissonance-detecting error
or surprise minimization, i.e., minimizing the mathematical difference between
prediction and its posterior accuracy by way of epistemic (explorative) foraging.
As early as 1980, Louis (1980) pointedly captured the Bayesian essence of
organizational sensemaking as enactive prediction processing:
Sense making can be viewed as a recurring cycle comprised of a sequence of events
occurring over time. The cycle begins as individuals form unconscious and conscious
anticipations and assumptions, which serve as predictions about future events. Subsequently,
56
6
Structure: Synergizing Governance and Operational Channels

individuals experience events that may be discrepant from predictions. Discrepant events, or
surprises, trigger a need for explanation, or post-diction, and, correspondingly, for a process
through which interpretations of discrepancies are developed. Interpretation, or meaning, is
attributed to surprises. Based on the attributed meanings, any necessary behavioral responses
to the immediate situation are selected. Also based on attributed meanings, understandings
of actors, actions, and settings are updated and predictions about future experiences in the
setting are revised. The updated anticipations and revised assumptions are analogous to
alterations in cognitive scripts.
Organizational sensemaking is not about optimally approximating an objectively
deﬁned external reality, but developing and enacting models of reality by way of top-
down/bottom-up predictive coding. Effectively, the “future arrives in the present –
and becomes the past. Time moves at different rates in the brain’s hierarchy”
(Holmes 2020), as is true for the ﬁrm. While time has strictly no speed, humans
project speed onto time as relations and interactions increase in intensity and
complexity. A ﬁrm’s very existence is determined by its curiosity-fueled interaction
with its external environment: fast at the ‘reﬂex low level’ (i.e., resource-markets)
and more slowly at higher cognitive levels (i.e., strategic decision-making). “The
world that we know, that relates to us, that interests us, what we call ‘reality’, is the
vast web of interacting entities, of which we are part, that manifest themselves by
interacting with each other” (Rovelli 2021). Therefore, strategy process starts with
mapping probability distributions upon external (unknown and hidden) states
through inter-action; i.e., epistemic foraging.
This veil—separating the inside from the outside, i.e., the Markov blanket—is
guiding our novelty-seeking actions to generate stimuli that inferentially optimize
estimates of a bounded set of probabilities. “Our brain is poised to seek novelty and
surprise rather than to avoid uncertainty” (Clark 2016). Surprise is not only a
measure of error and entropy but should be embraced as a valuable source of
survival-relevant information: “Biological agents must therefore minimize the
long-term average of surprise to ensure that their sensory entropy remains low”
(Friston 2010).
We need error feedback loops to adjust predictions and, more importantly, to
eventually
update
prediction
models
(‘double-loop
learning’).
Surprise
is
information-rich but only of value when new information is instantly deployed to
generatively perfect predictions and underlying prediction models (in terms of
posterior precision, i.e., reliability). PPF lays the theoretical foundation for ‘failing
fast to succeed’, a critical facet of advancing innovation:
In short, the long-term (distal) imperative — of maintaining states within physiological
bounds — translates into a short-term (proximal) avoidance of surprise [. . .] This is where
free energy comes in: free energy is an upper bound on surprise, which means that if agents
minimize free energy, they implicitly minimize surprise. (Friston 2010)
Error messages, often in the form of rather soft signals, occur at the ﬁrm’s stimuli
level (bottom) close to resource markets (e.g., clients, products, suppliers, and
technologies) long before top leadership has ‘any sense’ of a challenge to existing
predictions and underlying models (Shepherd et al. 2017). Strategic renewal is
regrettably too often, in hindsight, a story of ‘dominant logics’-trapped Upper
Echelon admitting having missed and ignored relevant (and plainly accessible)
6.2
Prediction Processing Framework (PPF)

signals early on. Consequently, “in every case of survival, the reorientations
included wholesale replacements of the top managers, and we infer that survival
requires this” (Starbuck 1983).
Wurtzel, former Chairman/CEO and the founder’s son of a leading US electron-
ics retailer that ﬁled for bankruptcy, tracks in his brilliant and timeless ﬁrst-hand
account—Good to Great to Gone: The 60 Year Rise and Fall of Circuit City—Upper
Echelon’s ‘skilled incompetence’ or ‘trained incapacity’ leading to corporate
demise. Wurtzel (2012) advances the concept of Habits of Mind to explain why
organizations succeed or are challenged with survival. More speciﬁcally, Habits of
Mind may equally explain why Upper Echelon is generally resisting strategy process
as a matter of top-down/bottom-up prediction error minimization. Instead, strategic
deafness prevails:
My premise is that there can be no “rules” or “formulas” for business strategy. Strategies are
situational[. . .] Behind every strategy, however, lie Habits of Mind of those who developed
the strategy[. . .]Habits of Mind are not situation-speciﬁc, but ways of thinking about one’s
organization in relation to the world in which it exists. It is theses Habits of Mind that drive
strategic decision-making and lead either to success or to failure. (Wurtzel 2012, emphasis
by DBK)
Five out of Wurtzel’s twelve Habits of Mind can be considered PPF foundational,
fostering success of strategic renewal:
“Be Humble, Run Scared: Continuously doubt your understanding of things. Business
success contains the seeds of its own destruction”; “Curiosity Sustains the Cat: The world
is constantly changing. Be open and curious and strive to learn from others”; “Evidence
Trumps Ideology: In business, as in politics, decisions are too often based on unproven
assumptions about what works and what doesn’t. We all need operating assumptions about
human nature, the economy, and the like, but when things do not work out as planned, we
need to determine whether our assumptions were based on evidence or ideology”; “Con-
front the Brutal Facts: The worst person you can fool is yourself. Ignoring or denying
reality does not help it go away”; “Chase the Impossible Dream: Do not be limited by [. . .]
the “Tyranny of the OR”. (Wurtzel 2012)
Indeed, it is a fact of ‘being human’ that our actions and decisions cannot be
entirely ring-fenced from our very habits of mind. However, critical self-awareness
for habits of mind is essential. Certain habits—as much as they are at one point a
source of success—will breed inertia in the absence of critical self-evaluation
(Hoppmann et al. 2019): “the processes which produce crises are substantially
identical to the processes which produce successes” (Starbuck and Milliken 1988).
PPF’s top-down/bottom-up generative prediction error processing is possibly best
suited to neutralize Upper Echelon’s subtle but nonetheless often prevailing resis-
tance for habits to be generatively challenged by bottom-up stimuli.
Today’s organizations are generally an artifact of top-down centralization geared
toward minimizing uncertainty by way of environmental adaptation. Firms develop a
risk-averse tendency and preference for being rather ‘fast followers’ than ‘ﬁrst-line
enactors/innovators’. This mode of organizing, however, is visibly struggling in a
discontinuous and distributed world. In vain, we keep looking for guiding certainty:
Hence, we look for supervision either by employing external learning analogies, such as the
computer programmer, or we look in vain for some kind of bootstrapping self-supervision
58

Structure: Synergizing Governance and Operational Channels

[. . .] We ﬁnd the required additional constraints, the knowledgeable supervisor, in the world
itself [. . .] Perhaps the mistake, in earlier conceptions of the problem of perception, was to
look for a supervisor (a programmer or the system itself), which somehow knows the truth
[. . .] The prediction error minimization approach cuts out the middleman and lets the
supervisor be the truth itself [. . .] perceptual content is given in our predictions and
this is precisely what allows the world to deliver a supervisory signal. (Hohwy 2013;
emphasis by DBK)
It is the circular causality of belief propagation/message-passing where PPF’s
effectiveness in the organizational context most likely breaks down. Neither the
bottom-up message-passing nor the top-down belief propagation are unobstructed.
We fail to appreciate how organizational friction (high levels of free energy)
compromise ﬁrm performance due to: (1) top-down (enforced) predictions and
prediction models that are not receptive to bottom-up challenge, (2) weak
top-down/bottom-up/lateral generative sensing and sensemaking capabilities in
form of error signaling and processing; and (3) poor communication and absence
of a language that is suitable to leverage PPF for strategic renewal.
In the organizational context, PPF is determined by three categorical imperatives:
(1) Upper Echelon’s prediction models and corresponding predictions must be
“explainable”4 and explicitly articulated and communicated top-down to be
bottom-up challenged. The language and communications layers are critical to
resource reconﬁguration (Helfat and Peteraf 2015), ﬁrm performance, and,
eventually, ﬁrm survival: “Heidegger’s revolutionary proposal was that “it is
in words and language that things ﬁrst come into being and are”” (Taylor and
Van Every 2000). Indeed, “[t]o a phenomenologist language is not a window
through which to observe social reality but a canvas on which it gets painted
[. . .] For him or her, the language of communication is not just a medium or
means or instrument (although it is that too) but theme, because it is in language
that reality comes into being” (Taylor and Van Every 2000). It is an enactive
interpretation of language.
(2) Each of the hierarchical layers must have formal and informal interfaces that
couple each layer to the next layer. For a given hierarchical structure of a ﬁrm to
have any legitimacy, generative top-down/bottom-up sensing and sensemaking
at every hierarchical level should equally make sense before an error message
travels to the next level. There should not and cannot be any bypassing of
hierarchical layers. In short, for the learning-driven prediction processing orga-
nization to be effective, each hierarchical layer must not only be engaged and
empowered to challenge predictions but, more importantly, that layer must be
cognitively and operationally coupled to the next layer. If any layer can be
bypassed or excluded, then that layer has no organizational legitimacy.
(3) The ﬁrm’s generative model is the ﬁrm’s eco-niche. When we perceive the world
as uncertain and unpredictable, it is a mere reﬂection of the inadequacy of our
generative (reality) model. This is mostly due to a lack of purpose, predictions
4Yan Yuﬁk must be credited with the term “explainable” in this context (personal conversation,
October 2020).
6.2
Prediction Processing Framework (PPF)
59

not being consciously explainable and, consequently, relevant stimuli emanating
from resource markets cannot be captured and processed in form of prediction
error minimization. But above all, Upper Echelon’s error-feedback receptivity is
either non-existent or clouded by Habits of Mind, eventually incapacitating the
ability to listen to what wants to emerge.
The human brain ceaselessly engages in prediction error minimization, continu-
ously building new and stronger neural connections and more reliable world models.
In fact, the brain’s plasticity is driven by one ﬁrst-order principle in form of a
‘categorical imperative’: free energy (error) minimization. However, organizations
will never work as efﬁciently as the (Bayesian) brain. But it is a target model worth
approximating: purpose-directed, action-centric, top-down/bottom-up belief propa-
gation/message-passing-enabling, dissonance-seeking, and fundamentally predic-
tion error minimizing to minimize surprise, simply put: free energy minimizing.
The consequences for organizational design, environmental engagement, leader-
ship capabilities, as well as strategy process are far-reaching. PPF provides an
entirely new perspective and language embracing strategic renewal as a matter of
bottom-up/top-down prediction error minimization. More importantly, PPF and
FEG deﬁne strategy as hypothesis testing (Dong et al. 2016) connecting in circular
causality structure, cognition, and capabilities.
The board of directors should not only serve as a purveyor as well as surveyor of
the ﬁrm’s prediction models but must pro-actively ensure that the models and the
predictions that Upper Echelon generates are explainable across the entire organi-
zation (communication and language), are continuously bottom-up challenged, and
timely evolve when predictions’ accuracy is weakening or is consistently failing, i.e.,
free energy is rising. The board of directors’ essential focus should be to build and
guide the development of an organizational structure, a mode of environmental
engagement, and cognitive capabilities (at the board level, TMT, and throughout
the organization) that are fundamentally dedicated to prediction error minimization,
i.e., free energy minimization.
For example, one could argue that corporate governance is generally caught in a
certain PPF dilemma: (1) the quest for novelty and to embrace surprise as informa-
tion-enriching emphasizes the exploration-oriented board dedicated to ﬁrm perfor-
mance and survival, while (2) the avoidance of surprise and uncertainty is
characteristic of the entrenched ‘hands-off, nose-in’ exploitation monitoring board
that is overly concerned with risk avoidance and obsessed with stereotypical diversity
in board composition as a basis for board effectiveness and ‘best practices’ compli-
ance. The latter logic is not only programmed for ﬁnancial rather than strategic
control but above all is novelty poor, anchored in impoverished levels of curiosity.
Here, the objective is not to model when the one or the other governance logic is
likely to dominate. In fact, all boards are certain to be caught in this ﬁeld of
dichotomist tension at some point in the ﬁrm’s lifecycle. But according to Free
Energy Governance, at all times, the board must assume a critical role as guarantor of
continuous top-down/bottom-up generative prediction error minimization across and
within all hierarchical levels, independent of whether the emphasis at a given point is
rather ﬁnancial- than strategic-control centric.

[PP] traces the path from perceptual inference to active inference to active inference about
uncertainty (i.e., precision) to our current position that is starting to deal with epistemic
inference (i.e., salience) and the nature of novelty, curiosity [. . .] it is clear that we are
nowhere near the end of the journey. (Friston 2019)
Indeed, inference is enactive. A structural interpretation of PPF, on its own, is
rather incomplete. But PP lays the structural foundation to redeﬁne board gover-
nance in service of continuous strategic renewal. As Siebel (2019) rightly asserts in
the context of digital transformation, ‘it is not just a good idea, it’s about survival’.

Cognition: From Superposition to Reality
Abstract Attention-Based View (ABV) and Enactivist Approach (EA) address
FEG’s ‘cognition’ dimension. To this day, strategy management research is not
entirely de-chained from its very path dependency of putting perception ahead of
action, i.e., putting environment ahead of strategy. While ABV’s structure-cognition
nexus is FEG’s critical building block, ABV erroneously treats action as a conse-
quence of perception. Once we embrace attention as action-generated, we start
understanding that clever analysis in form of belief-updating follows action-
generated stimuli, not the other way around. ABV is trapped in the ‘old-school’
limitations imposed by ‘bounded rationality’. In a discontinuous and distributed
(quantum) world, agents’ ‘bounded rationality’ is ‘meaningless’ as enactive infer-
ence empowers ‘the world to deliver a supervisory signal’. Effectively, agents
off-load ‘the burden of cognition’ to the environment. Bounded rationality is
replaced by extended cognition. The boundedness of human cognition is effectively
neutralized. There are at least as many reality models as there are economic actors.
Every organization chooses—akin to holding (acting upon) a light torch in the
darkness—which environmental signiﬁcance to attend to. Whatever the torch high-
lights is equivalent to breaking a quantum wave of probabilities—moving from
superposition to reality, intermediated by the Markov blanket. Environmental enact-
ment is essentially a purpose-directed, inter-active, inferential, and social learning
(sensemaking) process.
7.1
Attention-Based View (ABV)
Attention is a concept with a long and rich yet diverse history in organization science.
(Ocasio 2011)1
1See Ocasio (2011) for an epistemological overview of attention in organization science. Attention
“is not a unitary concept but a variety of interrelated mechanisms and processes that at the level of
the human brain operate in diverse ways [and research] is similarly focused on diverse aspects of
attention: attentional perspective, attentional engagement, and attentional selection” (Ocasio 2011).

Ocasio (1997) proposes ABV as an attention-centric meta-theory for socially
situated organizational action and adaptation, linking structure and Upper Echelon
cognition: (1) what decision-makers do depends on their focus (focus of attention),
(2) what they focus on depends on the context (situated attention), and (3) context
depends on the ﬁrm’s rules, resources, and social relationships (structural distribu-
tion of attention). ABV advances an interpretation of “strategy as the product of
relatively tacit psychological mechanisms that activate, buffer, or guide managers in
their strategic thoughts” (Bouquet and Birkinshaw 2011).
To this day, ABV is one of strategy research’s most important and relevant
frameworks, while Ocasio himself remains one of the most proliﬁc researchers in
the ﬁeld of strategic cognition. Ocasio not only advanced the linkage of structure and
cognition but strategy as an organizationally distributed phenomenon:
As such, the ABV may be viewed as part of two recent trends in strategic management. The
ﬁrst is found in attempts to build a behavioral theory of strategy (Gavetti, 2012; Powell,
Lovallo, & Fox, 2011) by exploring the cognitive foundations of strategy making, compet-
itive advantage, and ﬁrm performance. The second is the increasing emphasis on providing
microfoundations for macro constructs, such as dynamic capabilities (Felin & Foss, 2005;
Gavetti 2005; Teece, 2007). At the same time, the ABV harkens back to foundational work
in management, especially Simon’s work on bounded rationality (Simon, 1947; Simon &
March 1958). Indeed, the ABV extends Simon’s key point that limited attention is a central
aspect of the boundedness of human rationality. (Stea et al. 2015)
While ABV’s structure-cognition nexus is a critical building block of Free
Energy Governance, fundamentally, ABV suffers from severe shortcomings that
weaken its relevance to practice. By highlighting some of ABV’s most fundamental
weaknesses, we should further cement the case for FEG as a meta-theory connecting
in circular causality structure, cognition, and capabilities. Once we understand how
the Bayesian brain is building a model of its world, we start seeing how anachro-
nistic and full of friction our deep-rooted conceptions of organizational attention are.
ABV deﬁnes attention as “noticing, encoding, interpreting, and focusing of time
and effort by organizational decision-makers on both (1) issues [. . .] and
(2) answers” (Ocasio 1997), in particular concerning environmental change and
corresponding strategic action. Top leadership’s attention to the right issues and
solutions is considered the source of the ﬁrm’s competitive advantage. Essentially, it
is content- rather than process-centric, and the ﬁrm’s performance bottleneck
remains Upper Echelon’s attention, i.e., bounded rationality.
Attention is reductionist and implies trade-offs. Indeed, a ﬁrm’s performance is
determined by leveraging its structurally distributed attention as valuable ‘comput-
ing power’ such that the complexity and equivocality of market signals are neither
ignored nor ‘explained away’ (Shepherd et al. 2017) but optimally leveraged for
advancing the ﬁrm’s self-evidencing, i.e., survival. Therefore, ﬁrm outperformance
and survival are highly dependent on neutralizing the imposing dominance of Upper
Echelon’s cognitive boundedness, i.e., its centrality in top-down dictating organiza-
tional attention.

Cognition: From Superposition to Reality

The critical question then is how, in the ﬁrst place, context is selected to
determine attention or how bottom-up market signals connect with top-down
Upper Echelon expectations and predictions to determine attention? In a world
that is distributed and discontinuous, how can such processes be deﬁned and
implemented so that bottom-up stimuli can enhance the precision of top-down
attention in form of feeding as well as challenging predictions and underlying
prediction models so that a ﬁrm’s attention is a real-time product of continuous
top-down/bottom-up hypothesis testing?
Strategy is an inherently social property (Bouquet and Birkinshaw 2011; Dong
et al. 2016). The coupling of governance and operational channels (Ocasio and
Joseph
2005)—top-down
(prediction-driven)
and
bottom-up
(stimuli-/data-
driven)—is essential to fully leveraging a ﬁrm’s structurally distributed attention
as competitive advantage. While ABV views organizations as ‘systems of structur-
ally distributed attention’ (Ocasio 1997) where structure channels attention, ABV
treats the process of ‘channeling’ as a black box.
Indeed, the nature of stimuli that catches the attention of an organizational
member does vary in function of task speciﬁcity and hierarchical positioning: “the
interplay between cognitive and experiential, semiautomatic forms of behavior
suggests the need for more explicit attention to the role of the organizational
hierarchy than most theory on capabilities implies” (Gavetti 2005). In this regard,
ABV does not explicitly consider the board of directors’ potentially unique cognitive
role in terms of determining a ﬁrm’s attention.
Neither UEV nor ABV, both fundamentally top-down-oriented frameworks, have
given due consideration to the dynamic interplay between top management team
(TMT) and the board of directors. More speciﬁcally there is no transparent structural
link between the Upper Echelon level and ﬁeld intelligence, for example. The very
process that governs the two layers’ interactions in determining a ﬁrm’s attention and
actions remains opaque. Ocasio also recognized the need for attentional coherence
but lacks the speciﬁcs on how to achieve it:
Most theory and research on attention in organizations invokes top-down processes, whether
driven by goals (Cyert and March 1963, Greve 2008), identity (Hoffman and Ocasio 2001),
cognitive models (Kaplan 2008), or logics of action (Thornton and Ocasio 1999). Bottom-up
processes, or data- or stimulus-driven processes, have received less research attention,
although they are the focus of ecological perspectives (Hansen and Haas 2001, Hsu 2006)
[. . .] The interaction of top-down and bottom-up attentional processes is also implicit in the
Weick and Sutcliffe (2006) concept of the ‘quality’ of organizational attention and in the
Rerup (2009) analysis of attentional triangulation, combining attentional stability
(top-down), attentional vividness (bottom-up), and attentional coherence (combining
both). (Ocasio 2011)
This limitation is of particular relevance against the background that senior
managers “live inside their frames and, to a very great extent, don’t know what
lies outside” (Hamel and Prahalad 1994). While this may be equally true for
individual board directors, generally, directors are less likely to be trapped to the
same degree in the very same exploitation-centric frames as TMT is in a given
organization. ABV cannot explain attentional coherence.
7.1
Attention-Based View (ABV)
65

Further, the link between cognition and action is essential (Weick 1995): “What
people refer to as their environment is generated by human actions and accompa-
nying intellectual efforts to make sense out of these actions. The character of this
produced environment depends on the particular theories and frameworks, patterns
of attention, and affective dispositions supplied by the actor-observers” (Smirchich
and Stubbart 1984). However, ABV erroneously treats action as a consequence of
attention and perception. According to PPF, actions determine in circular causality
the stimuli that dictate attention and sensemaking. Once we embrace attention as
action-generated, we start understanding that clever analysis (Rindova 1999) in form
of belief-updating follows action-generated stimuli, not the other way around.
As highlighted earlier, language and communication are not mere tools but are the
very site of organizational becoming. Language must evolve to match and set free
the full potential of the multi-intelligence ﬁrm. This is an area that ABV is only lately
catching up with:
Research on attention has tended to overlook the social interactions underlying communi-
cation in shaping the situated attention and attentional engagement that occurs within and
between communication channels. [. . .] attention in the ABV [Attention Based View]
should be studied not only as an individual level cognitive phenomenon, but also as a social
one, where the attention and co-orientation of organizational actors is shaped by communi-
cation. (Burgelman et al. 2018)
Indeed, ABV is limited to ‘tacit psychological mechanisms’ (Bouquet and
Birkinshaw 2011), which is conceptually attractive but practically of little value.
Those ‘tacit psychological mechanisms’ have a name: free-energy minimizing
top-down/bottom-up prediction error minimization. While ABV is laying a critical
foundation in linking cognition and structure, the question arises whether ABV’s
attention will need to be redeﬁned as something more granular and practical.
Attention not only is too diffuse as a cognitive concept but also is hard to meaning-
fully operationalize in the context of continuous strategic renewal.
In that regard, PPF in form of enactive inference is potentially a critical comple-
ment to and possibly substitute for ABV. PPF provides the concepts and logics that
give new meaning to the linkage of structure and cognition. According to PPF,
prediction models and predictions self-optimize as a matter of pursuing surprise
minimization by way of free energy minimization. It is strictly, a priori, not an
attention challenge but a (purpose-directed) prediction challenge. The evolution of
self-driving vehicles provides an exemplary illustration of this point: once the
challenge was conceived as a prediction rather than attention challenge, the road to
perfection is simply a matter of continuous and purpose-directed prediction error
minimization:
[T]he ability to see a problem and reframe it as a prediction problem [is an]‘AI Insight’. . .
Autonomous vehicles could not function outside a highly predictable, controlled
environment – until engineers reframed navigation as a prediction problem. (Agrawal
et al. 2018)
Finally, ABV is treating environment as an objectively observer-independent
construct. According to ABV, the ﬁrm’s competitive advantage is determined by
paying attention to the right issues and answers waiting to be discovered ‘out there’,
66

Cognition: From Superposition to Reality

while attention’s critical moderators are managerial focus, situational context, and
degree of structural distribution. ABV is trapped in the ‘old-school’ limitations
imposed by ‘bounded rationality’. In a discontinuous and distributed (quantum)
world, agents’ bounded rationality is ‘meaningless’ as “perceptional content is given
in our predictions and this is precisely what allows the world to deliver a supervisory
signal” (Hohwy 2013). Effectively, the ﬁrm is off-loading “the burden of cognition to
its environment” (Lindsay 2021). ‘Bounded rationality’ is replaced by extended
cognition. The boundedness of human cognition is effectively neutralized.
Once we exit the classical logic of cause-effect locality and embrace the world in
superposition as probabilistic, it becomes evident that the ﬁrm selects through action
its very stimuli according to its existential purpose. Therefore, bounded rationality—
in terms of the agent’s limitation to pay attention to and compute all relevant
objective stimuli beholding the ‘truth of the world’ as a basis for resource recombi-
nation—is non-sensical. Reality is not what it seems (Rovelli 2017):
What we perceive as reality is a process that involves our consciousness. An external reality,
if it existed, would by deﬁnition have to exist in the framework of space and time. But space
and time are not independent realities but rather tools of the human and animal mind. (Lanza
et al. 2020)
In a discontinuous and distributed world, the antecedents of competitive advan-
tage are changing. They are less rooted in top management’s attentional focus but the
ﬁrm’s very system of cross-hierarchical interactions that activates the self-organizing
multi-intelligence ﬁrm in form of purpose-directed, curiosity-driven, and environ-
mentally enacting top-down/bottom-up prediction error minimization, i.e., enactive
inference. ABV, nonetheless, must be credited with laying management science’s
foundation for linking structure and cognition and introducing neuroscience-based
concepts to strategy management.
We now turn to environmental enactment as a foundation for cognition.
7.2
Enactivist Approach (EA)
Emergence of a self entails emergence of a world. The emergence of a self is also by
necessity the co-emergence of a domain of interactions proper to that self, an environment or
Umwelt [. . .] Emergence of a self and world ¼ sensemaking. The organism’s environment is
the sense it makes of the world. The environment is a place of signiﬁcance and valence, as a
result of the global action of the organism. (Thompson 2007)
Active inference is enactive inference (Ramstead et al. 2020). Indeed, the essen-
tial question is how the ﬁrm brings forth ‘signiﬁcance and valence’ that does not pre-
exist but is the result of action-centric and socially constructed engagement with the
outer world—equivalent to internally assigning probabilities to external (hidden,
unknown) states in form of a Markov blanket. This revealing of ‘signiﬁcance and
valence’ then lays the foundation for generating ‘shared meaning’ and ‘shared
expectations’ in form of unique interpretation models (belief systems) underlying
ﬁrm performance and survival.
7.2
Enactivist Approach (EA)
67

As the organization is sensing and making sense of the environment, in fact, the
organization engages in enacting an environment (eco-niche) proper to that of the
ﬁrm:
I use the word enactment to preserve the fact that, in organizational life, people often produce
part of the environment they face (Pondy & Mitroff, 1979, p.17). I like the word because it
suggests that there are close parallels between what legislators do and what managers
do. Both groups construct reality through authoritative acts. (Weick 1995)
Enactive inference is not a form of top-down authoritative acts but a matter of
top-down/bottom-up eco-niche construction (Constant et al. 2018). Enactment and
sensemaking are purpose-directed, goal-oriented, and action-centric social processes
of reality construction, i.e., revealing environmental signiﬁcance and valence for a
given purpose and goals. Daft and Weick (1984) differentiate between environment-
driven and interpretation-driven approaches to strategy-making:
In environment-driven frames, top managers experience environments as concrete, hard,
measurable, and determinant. They therefore ﬁrst seek to identify environmental demands
and then develop strategies in response to them. Top managers thus assume the environment
to determine strategy. Such environment ! strategy beliefs represent deterministic logics
(Fahey and Narayanan, 1989). On the other hand, top managers of ﬁrms confronting more
unstable or unanalyzable environments are thought ‘to construct, coerce, or enact a reason-
able interpretation that makes previous action sensible’ (Daft and Weick, 1984: 287). Thus,
they attempt to construct their environments through their strategies rather than developing
strategies in response to environments (Lyles and Schwenk, 1992), resulting in strategy !
environment beliefs, or proactive logics (Fahey and Narayanan, 1989). (Nadkarni and Barr
2008; emphasis by DBK)
Despite Weick’s strong inﬂuence on strategic management research, to this day,
the environment-driven approach remains dominant. Consequently, in a world
characterized by discontinuities, Upper Echelon’s environmental perception is
increasingly trapped in uncertainty and unpredictability. To be environment-driven
in a discontinuous world is entropy-bound. “To argue that environments are enacted
[. . .] does not mean that environments are fabricated at will. Phenomenologically
speaking at least, it rather means that environments are brought to actors’ aware-
ness—are disclosed in particular ways [. . .] the environment is disclosed—namely it
is made available to experience” (Sandberg and Tsoukas 2015).
More speciﬁcally, PPF’s ‘disclosing’ is a matter of purpose-centric prediction
error minimization in pursuit of surprise minimization to resist entropy to persist.
Active states (action), sensory states (perception), internal states (ﬁrm resources),
and external states (hidden and unknown states beyond the Markovian veil) are
dynamically linked such that internal and external states are conditioned by the
Markov blanket which in turn is a function of action and perception (i.e., ﬁrm
resources). And everything is orchestrated in circular causality by one simple ﬁrst-
order principle: free energy minimization—in pursuit of minimizing surprise to
minimize dissipation.
To this day, strategy management research is not entirely de-chained from its very
path dependency of putting perception ahead of action, i.e., putting environment
ahead of strategy. According to strategic choice theory (Child 1972), ﬁrms choose
68
7
Cognition: From Superposition to Reality

their environmental domains,2 and according to the theory of environmental deter-
minism (Aldrich 1979), the organizational population evolves as a function of
environment-controlled selection and retention processes.3 “Most researchers seem
to place themselves somewhere between these polar views. Despite the heated
discussion, however, neither the strategic choicers, nor the environmental determin-
ists, nor those in between, question the pivotal notion of environments as inde-
pendent, external, and tangible entities” (Smirchich and Stubbart 1984; emphasis
by DBK).
Organizations socially construct (enact) their eco-niche in form of ‘shared mean-
ing’ and ‘shared expectations’ through action. “[B]asic biology makes it clear that
what appears ‘out there’ is actually a construction – a whirl of neural-electrical
activity – occurring in the brain” (Lanza et al. 2020). Environment is never ﬁxed but
a dynamic co-construct of organizational action and perception. Environment is
“made available to experience” (Thompson 2007). Every organization chooses—
akin to holding a light torch in the darkness—which environmental signiﬁcance to
act upon and attend to. Whatever the torch highlights is equivalent to breaking a
quantum wave of probabilities—moving from superposition to reality, intermediated
by the Markov blanket. In this regard, strategy research is challenged to be less
mechanistically deterministic (environment ! strategy) but more quantum (strategy
! environment):
The quantum world is more tenuous than the one imagined by old physics; it is made up of
happenings, discontinuous events, without permanence. It is a world with ﬁne texture,
intricate and fragile as Venetian lace. Every interaction is an event, and it is these light
and ephemeral events that weave reality, not the heavy objects charged with absolute
properties that our philosophy posited in support of these events. (Rovelli 2021)
Indeed, the more ‘explainable’ and more broadly ‘shared’ a ﬁrm’s Markov
blanket—deﬁned as conditional independencies between internal and external
states—the stronger and more effective the error minimization process, and the
more likely that surprise is leveraged for the purpose of advancing (un-)learning,
knowledge creation, and model optimization. “The problem is that there are too many
meanings, not too few. The problem faced by the sensemaker is one of equivocality,
not one of uncertainty. The problem is confusion, not ignorance” (Weick 1995).
The critical consideration is how an organization trans-morphs the sensing and
sensemaking activity at the individual level into a ﬁrm’s (institutionalized) environ-
mental enactment as a basis for continuous strategic renewal. Enactment is essen-
tially an (interactive and generative) social learning (sensemaking) process (Crossan
and Berdrow 2003)—hence, enactive inference. Dong et al. (2016) elegantly address
this micro-macro dichotomy: “While hypothesis setting is an individual activity,
2“Child argues that organizations can select their environmental domains, that environmental forces
are not so conﬁning that they cannot be outﬂanked or sometimes even safely ignored” (Smirchich
and Stubbart 1984).
3“Aldrich believes that ‘environments’ are relentlessly efﬁcient in weeding out any organization
that does not closely align itself with environmental demands. He doubts that many organizations
self-consciously change themselves very much or very often, or that the conscious initiatives by
organizations are likely to succeed” (Smirchich and Stubbart 1984).
7.2
Enactivist Approach (EA)
69

hypothesis testing is an organizational activity” (Dong et al. 2016). According to
Smirchich and Stubbart (1984), “organization members actively form (enact) their
environments through their social interaction. A pattern of enactment establishes the
foundation of organizational reality, and in turn has effects in shaping future
enactments. The task of strategic management in this view is organization making
— to create and maintain systems of shared meaning that facilitate organized
action.”
It is impossible to address enactment at the ﬁrm level without due consideration to
hierarchy (structure), i.e., the cognitive coupling of governance and operational
channels, in form of top-down/bottom-up prediction error minimization. In addition,
due consideration must be given to capabilities such as sensing (making action-
generated stimuli available for sensemaking) and sensemaking (continuously
top-down reassigning probabilities to predictions and re-evaluate prediction models
on the basis of bottom-up stimuli feedback loops; i.e., belief-updating). Organiza-
tions are challenged to better distinguish how their actions differ from those of others
as they construct eco-niches. The sensing system of certain types of ﬁsh is of interest
in this regard:
[W]henever a ﬁsh emits a pulse it also sends a copy of the command around to the sensing
system, enabling that system to counteract the effect of the pulse it has produced. The ﬁsh is
tracking and registering the distinction between “self” and “other”, between the effects on its
senses of its own actions and the effects of events going on around it. (Godfrey-Smith 2016)
The ‘ﬁsh’ illustrates that we have to look no further than the animal world to
understand the very human limitations of sensing as well as distinguishing between
‘self’ and ‘other’. It is fascinating to assess the environmental enactment capabilities
of animals:
[S]harks have organs called Lorenzini blisters, which sense electrical ﬁelds’. Dolphins and
toothed whales, for example, beneﬁt from echolocation abilities, ‘whose sound pulses can
penetrate soft tissue to provide them with an X-ray-like mental image of the object of
interest’. In order to ‘tell’ other dolphins what they have discovered, ‘they actually create
a visual picture of what they just saw in the minds of other dolphins. (Lanza et al. 2020).
In a discontinuous and distributed world, linear cause-effect thinking is struggling
to make sense of ‘exponential reality’. Concepts such as uncertainty and
unpredictability are effectively an expression or, more appropriately, an admission
of the very limitations of the ﬁrm’s prediction processing model and, more specif-
ically, the ﬁrm’s free energy minimization (in-)capability. The pursuit of distilling
objectively deﬁned deterministic relationships, so characteristic of strategy and
governance research, is failing to guide practice to thrive in a discontinuous world:
Energy is but a representation of the mind, a rule of its understanding. In the mind, were we
able to lay it open, we would see the internal logic of the universe. [. . .] The answer lies not
in any isolated, external deﬁnition of ‘nature’, but in ourselves. (Lanza et al. 2020)

Cognition: From Superposition to Reality

To act upon the world to listen and sense what wants to emerge is fundamental to
strategic renewal and ﬁrm survival: “Listen from what you know, from what
surprises you, from the whole, and from what you sense wants to emerge (the
emerging whole)” (Scharmer 2018). Environmental enactment is a function of
purpose-directed exploitation and exploration of a ﬁrm’s eco-niche. In a discontin-
uous world, powered by pervasive connectivity, the eco-niche’s web of relations and
corresponding interactions is becoming too complex to compute with linear thinking
and classical tools. Hence, the more critical and survival-relevant become our
governance (enactive inference) models.
More speciﬁcally, optimization is essential across the constituent elements deter-
mining the circular causality underlying enactive inference: (1) actions generating
reliable sensory input (precision), (2) the ability to express beliefs about beliefs’
consequences (sophistication) to enact only a bounded set of external states,
(3) leveraging salience without missing the very error-signaling value that
non-salient stimuli may nonetheless behold, and (4) the foresight to anticipatorily
develop and strengthen the internal states (i.e., ﬁrm resources) in form of capabilities
critical to resource recombination (sensing/sensemaking/duality management).
In fact, if the ﬁrm is an enactive inference machine expressed as a generative
model, then the board of directors is the purveyor as well as surveyor of the ﬁrm’s
generative model. Reconﬁguring assets in a discontinuous quantum world imposes a
new governance mandate. Consequently, ﬁrms and, more speciﬁcally, the board of
directors must develop new dynamic (meta-)capabilities.
Duality is an essential quantum concept that underpins the mastery of managing
the distributed and discontinuous nature of today’s market realities.

Capabilities: Duality Management
Abstract Dynamic Capability View (DCV) and Antagonistic Neural Networks
Perspective (ANNP) address FEG’s ‘capabilities’ dimension. The board’s cognitive
capabilities in terms of meta-managing interdependently opposing logics as unity are
increasingly relevant to continuous strategic renewal. Duality management—such as
vacillation between exploitation vs. exploration and balancing ﬁnancial and strategic
control—is established as a dynamic board capability. Effectively, FEG extends
DCV to the board level. More importantly, by adopting a free energy principle-
powered perspective—i.e., redeﬁning the ﬁrm as an enactive inference machine—
DCV’s triplet of ‘sensing, seizing, and reconﬁguring assets’ is operationalized such
that the ﬁrm is engaged as a ‘whole’. ANNP is established and applied as the
neuroscientiﬁc basis for duality management: managing the existing while
contradicting the present to develop the future. This TPN/DMN antagonism—
between exploitative task execution (TPN) and explorative (abductive) thinking
(DMN)—is a neurological representation of the contradictory demands that chal-
lenges companies’ sustainable outperformance and survival. The board’s traditional
monitoring and advisory roles must be explicitly complemented with a duality
(TPN/DMN) management mandate. More speciﬁcally, the board’s dynamic capa-
bility of duality management lays the foundation for the board’s newly established
governance purpose in discontinuous and distributed markets: ‘duality stewardship’.
8.1
Dynamic Capability View (DCV)
The dynamic capability view (DCV) has become a vibrant topic in the domain of
strategic management, originating “in spirit from Schumpeter’s (1934) innovation-
based competition where competitive advantage is based on the creative destruction
of existing resources and novel recombination into new operational capabilities”
(Pavlou and El Sawy 2011).
A variety of interpretations or emphasis within DCV have emerged. Strategic
change, innovation, and learning are at its core (Vogel and Guettel 2013). Sensing
strategic opportunities in dynamic market environments, seizing the opportunity, and

reconﬁguring a ﬁrm’s resource base accordingly are DCV’s central three pillars
(Teece 2007):
For example, Amazon’s launch of the Kindle in 2006 involved sensing the impending threat
to its core bookselling business, seizing the opportunity through rapid development of a ﬁrst-
generation e-book reader, and then gradually reconﬁguring its internal activities to ensure
that the Kindle became an integrated part of its overall market offering. (Birkenshaw et al.
2016)
According to Eisenhardt and Martin (2000), dynamic capabilities are rather
non-idiosyncratic ‘routines’ or ‘well-known processes such as alliancing, product
development, and strategic decision making’: “while the speciﬁcs of any given
dynamic capability may be idiosyncratic to a ﬁrm (e.g., exact composition of a
cross-functional product development team) and path dependent in its emergence,
'best practice' exists for particular dynamic capabilities across ﬁrms,” and, hence,
competitive advantage “lies in using dynamic capabilities sooner, more astutely, or
more fortuitously than the competition to create resource conﬁgurations that have
that advantage” (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000).
Helfat et al. (2007), in contrast, juxtaposes dynamic capabilities to operational
capabilities and routines: “A dynamic capability is the capacity of an organization to
purposefully create, extend, or modify its resource base.” Dynamic capabilities are
fundamental to the meta-conversation that nourishes continuous strategic renewal.
Concerning strategic capabilities such as M&A and alliancing, of course, there are
‘best practices’ that are non-idiosyncratic. But this is not what dynamic capabilities
are about. “In a similar manner to that in which organizational learning research
distinguishes between single-loop and double-loop learning (Argyris and Schön,
1978), capability research also distinguishes between operational capabilities and
dynamic capabilities” (Laamanen and Wallin 2009).
There has been lately a shift in DCV from behavioral to cognitive interpretations
(Helfat and Peteraf 2015), explicating the cognitive microfoundations underpinning
Teece’s (2007) three core pillars of dynamic capabilities: (1) sensing (perception),
(2) seizing (sensemaking), and (3) asset reconﬁguration (language, communication,
and social cognition):
With respect to dynamic managerial capabilities for seizing and reconﬁguring in particular,
we have emphasized ways in which top management can shape aspects of the organizational
context, such as by encouraging cooperation, lowering resistance to change, designing a
business model for a new venture, and investing in new skills and assets. This suggests that
managerial cognitive capabilities may function as mediators of the relationship between
changes in organizational context and strategic change, which in turn can affect ﬁrm
performance. (Helfat and Peteraf 2015)
To advance DC for the purposes of this book, we must ﬁrst address one of DC’s
critical moderators: the nature of market dynamics. DC’s traditional distinction
between moderate and high velocity dynamics may have lost its practical relevance.
Indeed, independently of industrial vertical, the increasingly distributed and discon-
tinuous nature of market-transforming forces cannot be overestimated. However,
‘market velocity’ is too generic of a concept. A more suitable DC concept is Schmitt
et al.’s (2016) environmental scarcity (inspired by Cameron and Zammuto 1983),
74

Capabilities: Duality Management

meaningfully relating sensing and sensemaking as meta-capabilities, respectively, to
eco-niche dynamics and strategic renewal:
Combining the type and the rate of decline allows us to distinguish four environmental
scarcity situations (Zammuto and Cameron, 1985): environmental dissolution (gradual
decline in shape); environmental erosion (gradual decline in size); environmental collapse
(sudden decline in shape); and environmental contraction (sudden decline in size). (Schmitt
et al. 2016)
In certain environmental scenarios, sensing rather than sensemaking is the more
relevant challenge, and vice versa. More importantly, the same perception (sensing)
does not necessarily lead to the same interpretation and action plan (seizing the
opportunity and reconﬁguring resources accordingly). While slow and gradual
market changes test in particular our sensing capability, more sudden changes
challenge a ﬁrm’s sensemaking capability. There really is no objectively uncertain
market environment: uncertainty is an actor-dependent mental experience facing
one’s very limitations of the dynamic interplay between sensing and sensemaking.
Therefore, independent of the degree of market velocity, dynamic capabilities are
critical.
It is worth recalling the essence of Free Energy Governance’s underlying enactive
inference: the challenge is not “choosing the right response in light of a given
stimulus but [. . .] choosing the right stimulus in light of a given goal” (Anderson
2014). In particular, at times of environmental scarcity (Schmitt et al. 2016) such as
the sudden collapse and contraction of capital markets banking in 2007/2008, for
example, sensing (perception) is likely to be rather univocal across the banking
industry, but sensemaking (seizing the opportunity) is certain to differ among
industry participants.
For example, JP Morgan, one of the world’s leading ﬁnancial services providers,
purpose-directedly acquired defunct Wall Street investment bank Bear Stearns in the
midst of the ﬁnancial market crisis (March 2008), while most other leading banks
were struggling to make sense of their very existence’s future. It is a ﬁrm’s timeless
purpose—continuously reinterpreted and translated in form of medium-term goals as
well as ad hoc action readiness—that determines the ﬁrm’s sensemaking and
whether scarcity, in whatever shape and rate of change, is actionized as opportunity
to ‘lead and disrupt’ (O’Reilly and Tushman 2016):
[S]ituations of sudden environmental decline (i.e., environmental contraction and environ-
mental collapse) send strong and clear signals that do not create challenges for managerial
perception (Zammuto and Cameron, 1985). In these situations, managerial interpretation is
more important, since it determines how senior executives assess the challenges arising from
environmental decline, evaluate alternative strategic opportunities, and translate their inter-
pretations into strategic choices. (Schmitt et al. 2016)
The stronger and sudden the impact of environmental scarcity, the higher the
urgency to act, and, hence, the stronger the tendency for strategic renewal to be rather
‘ﬁnancial control’-centric (i.e., M&A and other forms of alliancing), precisely for two
reasons: (1) the existing resource base is too trapped in the past to unlearn and advance
renewal from within and without or (2) the opportunity for market consolidation is too
irresistible (as JP Morgan had demonstrated during the 2007/2008 ﬁnancial crisis)
and time-to-action is critical. At that stage, emphasizing ﬁnancial control by

tapping into the corporate control market must be the right strategic choice, either as an
acquiror or as an acquiree.
In fact, at any point in time, a ﬁrm is challenged to balance strategic (organic
R&D-driven innovation and growth) with ﬁnancial control (external growth and
innovation by way of forms of strategic partnering). There is no tyranny of OR
(Wurtzel 2012). It is a duality, a continuous ‘balancing act’ that is mutually
reinforcing and, with perspective in time and space, forms a unity. FEG establishes
duality management as a dynamic capability, speciﬁcally as a dynamic board
capability.
Tension
among
competing,
opposing,
and
potentially
contradictory
organizational-level objectives and logics is real: “Over two decades have passed
since Handy (1994) noted that the phrase, ‘It’s a paradox,’ had become a manage-
ment cliché for describing opposing forces in complex organizational environments.
For Handy, the phrase was overused and underspeciﬁed; but it typiﬁed a fact of life,
that is, contradiction and paradox are the ‘new normal’ in this volatile, rapidly
changing landscape of organizations” (Putnam et al. 2016).
Indeed, strategy management has traditionally embraced (1) environmental
co-creation
vs.
co-alignment,
(2)
exploitation
vs.
exploration,
and
(3) ﬁnancial vs. strategic control as dualism or paradox rather than as duality.
Against the background of a world that is increasingly distributed, discontinuous,
and inescapably interdependent, persistency in contradiction of interdependent ele-
ments—which is the deﬁning core of a paradox1—is potentially nonsense and
therefore severely limits the theoretical as well as practical relevance of a strategic
paradox lens (Smith and Lewis 2011):
Paradox scholars diverge from the dialectics tradition when the new synthesis renders the
underlying tension obsolete—in dialectics the synthesis meets a newly emerging antithesis,
while the tension in paradox persists. [. . .] [D]uality scholars stress the interplay between
contradictory elements as mutually constituted and ontologically inseparable, such that it
would be impossible to describe one without the other) [. . .] Duality scholars focus on
changing, processual, dynamic relationships that remain in a constant state of becoming.
(Schad et al. 2016)
Putnam et al. (2016) rightly shift “the locus of paradox and contradiction to
discourses, social interaction processes, practices, and ongoing organizational activi-
ties rather than actors’ cognitions or large-scale systems” and adopt “a bottom-up view
of organizing, one that focuses on how tensions, contradictions, and dialectics develop
as part of actions and interactions”. This is in line with Helfat and Peteraf (2015)
emphasizing language, communication, and social cognition as critical cognitive
microfoundations underpinning dynamic capabilities such as reconﬁguring the
ﬁrm’s asset base. The ﬁrm is a generative social ﬁeld and emerges in language.
Persistency of contradiction with regard to interdependent elements is nonsense.
1“We deﬁne paradox as contradictory yet interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist
over time” (Smith and Lewis 2011: 383). “We deﬁne paradox as persistent contradiction between
interdependent elements [...]. Even as paradox involves a dynamic and constantly shifting relation-
ship between alternative poles, the core elements remain impervious to resolution” (Schad et al.
2016).

Capabilities: Duality Management

It is important to appreciate that many dichotomies that have deﬁned the science
and practice of strategy management such as ﬁrm vs. environment, executive
leadership
vs.
non-executive
board,
individual
vs.
ﬁrm,
exploitation
vs.
exploration,
ﬁnancial
control
vs.
strategic
control,
formal vs. informal channels, and ﬂexibility vs. stability, for example, are less and
less dichotomist in a distributed and discontinuous world but co-exist in superposi-
tion as duality or synchronicity:
The study of the rise and fall of institutions highlights three key issues concerning the nature
of social systems and their development patterns: whether order or contest and disorganiza-
tion is the more common tendency in institutions; whether the roots of institutional trans-
formation are endogenous or exogenous (DiMaggio, 1988; Zucker, 1988); and whether
process matters in explaining institutional persistence and change. The speciﬁc context of an
emerging and turbulent ﬁeld underscores the question of whether and how institutions can
endure at all when they are continuously faced with change and innovation. (Farjoun 2002)
Therefore, the board’s cognitive capabilities in terms of meta-managing
interdependently opposing logics as unity are increasingly relevant to continuous
strategic renewal. How the board of directors and executive leadership relate to each
other and mutually reinforce their respective impact on ﬁrm performance and
survival
must
be
redeﬁned:
the
traditional
governance
dichotomy
of
‘control vs. collaboration’ (Sundaramurthy and Lewis 2003) is not a paradox but a
duality. In a discontinuous world that demands continuous strategic renewal, the
board cannot exercise its (‘best practices’-imposed) ‘supervisory’ mandate without
being an integral part of the generative top-down/bottom-up process of predictive
coding empowering strategic renewal.
This book adopts a duality-centric action perspective where ﬁrm-level tension
between opposing logics is the source of endogenously powered change as well as
stability (Farjoun 2002, 2010). Duality management—such as vacillation of
exploitation vs. exploration (Boumgarden et al. 2012) and balancing ﬁnancial and
strategic control (Hitt et al. 1996)—is established as a dynamic board capability. The
goal-directed, action-centric, and generative circular causality of top-down, bottom-
up, and lateral sensemaking processes (prediction error minimization) forms the
basis for leveraging opposing logics in form of duality.
In a discontinuous world, ambidexterity needs to be equally redeﬁned as duality.
The ‘ambidexterity school’ has emphasized structural compartmentalization to
empower a company’s simultaneous ability to exploit cash ﬂow in existing product
markets (operational capabilities) while exploring innovation around future sources
of growth. Indeed, ambidexterity is not “a complement to the dynamic capabilities
perspective” (Birkenshaw et al. 2016) but is a dynamic capability in its own right
(O’Reilly and Tushman 2008).
It has been tempting to address ambidexterity through a paradox lens. Indeed,
contradiction and competition among organization-level objectives are real. But in a
world that is both distributed and discontinuous, there is no placeholder for the
persistency of contradiction, the very deﬁning attribute of a paradox. Duality
management advocates real-time vacillation with different levels of emphasis

depending on the ﬁrm’s very speciﬁc needs at a point in time of the ﬁrm’s lifecycle.
This raises the question of whether the board of directors is uniquely positioned to
assume responsibility for supervising a sustainable balance or vacillation between
exploitation and exploration (Oehmichen et al. 2017) as well as ﬁnancial and
strategic control.
Financial control dangerously develops its very own top-down dynamics as
bottom-up stimuli are either intentionally or consequentially de-emphasized or
simply
anaesthetized.
The
connectivity
between
top-down
predictions and
bottom-up stimuli may falter as top management is less concerned with organic
bottom-up R&D but is dedicated to top-down justifying M&A rationales and
economics, for example. Consequently, Upper Echelon is in danger of surrendering
strategic control and getting trapped in the sprouting ‘comfort zone’ of ﬁnancial
control with potentially survival-threatening long-term consequences:
A potentially reliable indicator for the ‘ﬁnancial control trap’ is when bankers are increas-
ingly present in Upper Echelon discussions, advocating acquisitions and divestitures as a
basis to extend and modify the ﬁrm’s resource base. In contrast, the more team-members that
are closely connected to resource markets at the ﬁrm’s ‘bottom’ are interacting with the
board of directors – formally as well as informally – the less likely that ‘ﬁnancial control’
will solely shape strategic considerations.
Ensuring a sustainable balance between strategic and ﬁnancial control and
avoiding the trap of ‘ﬁnancial control’ are a mandate that the CEO-led executive
leadership cannot be solely entrusted with. It is at this critical juncture that the board
must exercise a meta-role supported by meta-capabilities to impose the ﬁrm as a
generative model in form of top-down/bottom-up prediction error minimization
governed by one simple ﬁrst-order principle: free energy minimization.
A ﬁrm’s sensing capability is only as good as dissonant market signals can
challenge in real time the ﬁrm’s sensemaking models. And unless ‘language,
communication, and social cognition’ (Helfat and Peteraf 2015) are geared toward
change and innovation, resource reconﬁgurations may be impossible to realize,
irrespective of the ﬁrm’s sensing and sensemaking capacity. Therefore, to effectively
operationalize DC’s triplet of sensing, seizing, and reconﬁguring, we need a model
that dynamically links DC’s triplet with environment. This is Free Energy Gover-
nance’s underlying enactive inference: (1) active states (action/sensing), (2) sensory
states (perception/sensemaking and seizing the opportunity), (3) internal states (ﬁrm
resources/resource reconﬁguration), and (4) external states (unknown/hidden) are
all linked in circular causality, conditioned by the internal/external Markov blanket
and governed by free energy minimization.
Contrary to Birkenshaw et al.’s (2016: 36) view that “it is not possible to identify
a universal set of dynamic capabilities”, Free Energy Governance establishes duality
management as a universal dynamic board capability. The non-executive meta-
management of tension between interdependent (but mutually constitutive) logics
(duality management) should be the very essence of the board’s strategic mandate in
discontinuous and distributed markets. However, so far, DC’s cognitive focus
remains ﬁrmly limited to the managerial level (Helfat and Peteraf 2015).
Free Energy Governance extends DCV to the board level. More importantly, by
adopting a free energy principle-powered perspective, the ﬁrm is redeﬁned as an
78

Capabilities: Duality Management

enactive inference machine. Successfully reconﬁguring assets, as Helfat and Peteraf
(2015) rightly identiﬁed, is a matter of communication and language. As assets are
not only distributed beyond the ﬁrm’s traditional boundaries but are increasingly
machine learning-powered, Upper Echelon is challenged to fundamentally
reconﬁgure its organizational vocabulary in the ﬁrst place in order to optimize the
effectiveness of the human-machine interface. Free Energy Governance in form of
enactive inference provides that language.
A neuroscience-inspired perspective will further support duality management as a
dynamic board capability. This leads us to the Antagonistic Neural Networks
Perspective (ANNP).
8.2
Antagonistic Neural Networks Perspective (ANNP)
Advances in neuroscience research—modeling the brain as “intrinsically organized
into dynamic, anti-correlated functional networks” (Fox et al. 2005)—offer a fertile
perspective that can potentially enrich our understanding of the board’s unique
(cognitive) role in strategic renewal.
ANNP is established and applied as the neuroscientiﬁc basis for duality manage-
ment: managing the existing while contradicting the present to develop the future. It is a
form of organizational learning that strategic management literature has labeled ambi-
dexterity (O’Reilly and Tushman 2008), co-managing exploitation and exploration.
In neuroscientiﬁc terms, the antagonistic relationship is between two large-scale
cortical networks—the task-positive network (TPN) and the default mode network
(DMN)—which, simply put, are neuroanatomical representations of top manage-
ment’s day-to-day task-speciﬁc focus on exploitation (TPN) on the one side and the
rather non-routine divergent and creative thinking that initiates exploration and
strategic renewal (DMN):
The TPN is important for problem solving, focusing of attention, making decisions, and
control of action. The DMN plays a central role in emotional self-awareness, social cogni-
tion, and ethical decision making. It is also strongly linked to creativity and openness to new
ideas. (Boyatzis et al. 2014)
Both networks are antagonistic. They cannot be activated simultaneously,
conﬁrming that it is impossible ‘to redesign (exploration) the plane while ﬂying it
(exploitation)’. But this is exactly what today’s strategic renewal and, eventually,
survival challenge is about. Neither structurally compartmentalizing nor inter-
temporal separation or simply leaving it to executive leadership can be the deﬁnite
answers to addressing the TPN/DMN challenge.
The very distributed and discontinuous nature of today’s market environments
imposes strategic renewal as a continuous mandate. Therefore, an “over-emphasis on
task-oriented leadership can prove deleterious to an organization: in particular when
openness to new ideas, people, emotions, and ethical concerns are important to
success” (Boyatzis et al. 2014). In fact, DMN may lay the neuroscientiﬁc foundation
8.2
Antagonistic Neural Networks Perspective (ANNP)

for innovative abduction: “Thus, our ﬁndings may indicate that individual creativity,
as measured by the divergent thinking test, is related to the inefﬁcient reallocation of
attention, congruent with the idea that diffuse attention is associated with individual
creativity” (Takeuchi et al. 2011). This dimension has been altogether ignored by the
Attention-Based-View (ABV).
The TPN/DMN antagonism—between task execution and explorative thinking—
is a neurological representation of the contradictory demands that challenge corpo-
rate leadership as well as companies’ sustainable outperformance and survival. More
speciﬁcally, it is this TPN/DMN antagonism that, according to the ambidexterity
school in management science (O’Reilly and Tushman 2008), is best resolved
through organizational compartmentalization, in particular, when innovation is of
a discontinuous rather than incremental nature.
However, O’Reilly and Tushman (2016) subsequently concluded that ‘to disrupt
and lead’, “a strong separation between the past and the future can undermine the
success of the new unit”. Indeed, “[e]xploration and exploitation function as com-
plements in generating organizational performance” (Boumgarden et al. 2012), and a
ﬁrm’s capability to cultivate real-time vacillation between exploitation and explora-
tion depending on the very demands at a given point in time represents a source of
competitive advantage.
Laureiro-Martínez et al. (2015) provide further insight into the respective neural
correlates: “Exploitation relies on brain regions associated mainly with anticipation
of rewards; exploration depends on regions associated mainly with attentional
control”. Their research is dedicated to demonstrating that “superior decision-
making performance relies on the ability to sequence” and “recognize when to
switch”. But here exploitation and exploration activities remain ‘separated’, and
Upper Echelon ‘switch-decisioning’ remains both a bottleneck and a black box.
Laureiro-Martínez and Brusoni (2018) subsequently introduced the concept of
‘cognitive ﬂexibility’. However, any conceptualization of ﬂexibility or agility must
be operationalized beyond top-down only ‘controlled’ decision-making processes.
FEG is ﬁrmly rooted in the belief that in a discontinuous and distributed world the
marginal beneﬁt of structural reorganizations as well as structural compartmentaliza-
tion of exploitation and exploration are rather suboptimal or possibly counterproduc-
tive. Competitiveness and survival are increasingly determined by the extent to which
a system is rather less rule- or top-down ‘supervised learning’-based. Exploration
happens increasingly in real time within exploitation. In effect, “the emergence of the
‘new’ is essentially hypothesis testing within the existing” (Khezri 2021).
In distributed and discontinuous market environments, the real leadership chal-
lenge is to ‘de-antagonize’ the TPN/DMN dichotomy in form of duality management.
Resolving the TPN/DMN challenge is rather difﬁcult to conceive without a unitary
framework such as FEG: integrating in circular causality top-down/bottom-up con-
nectivity (structure), action-centric enactment of environment (cognition), and dual-
ity management as a meta-TPN/DMN Upper Echelon capability (capabilities). Once
the TPN/DMN antagonism is conceived as a ‘free energy minimization’ challenge
rather than one of top-down directed ‘division-of-labor switching’, it becomes
obvious that today’s entrenched models of organizing are highly entropy-bound.

Capabilities: Duality Management

In discontinuous market environments, the source of competitive advantage is
determined by self-organizing ﬁrst-order principles linking in circular causality
top-down/bottom-up sensing, sensemaking, and asset reconﬁguration: Free Energy
Governance.
A distinctive feature of FEG is to explicitly embrace the ﬁrm’s formal as well as
informal organizations as equally relevant to message-passing and belief propaga-
tion. “There is a close link between formal and informal organization—formal
organization affects informal organization via its effects on who interacts with
whom” (Gulati and Puranam 2009). Hence, redeﬁning the formal role of the board
is critical to the informal processes resulting from it. A new (organizational rather
than just corporate) governance framework is required to resolve the TPN/DMN
antagonism.
FEG’s cross-hierarchical connectivity logically concludes that managing the
TPN/DMN antagonism is not a top-down challenge calling for structural compart-
mentalization but one of duality management: “By vacillating between (or among)
discrete formal organizational modes such as centralization and decentralization, the
organization may increase dynamically the levels of exploration and exploitation
beyond those achievable through an approach based strictly on a static design
choice” (Boumgarden et al. 2012).
In summary, we must conceive organizing as an informally deep learning and
self-designing compass. Centralizing intelligence—at any hierarchical layer of the
organization—can be counterproductive, increasing free energy, promoting entropy,
and eventually capitulating to TPN/DMN’s antagonistic forces.
In essence, the governance response to the TPN/DMN challenge is threefold:
1. Sensitizing the entire organization in regard to Upper Echelon’s tendency to
top-down extrapolating its dominant (supervising) knowledge structures, logics,
and past experience as guide and predictor for future success; a fallacy that task-
speciﬁc exploitation tends to reinforce (McKenzie et al. 2009).
2. Embracing strategic renewal as a matter of continuous deep learning in form of
cultivating cross-hierarchical processes empowering purpose-directed and action-
generated bottom-up market stimuli as a basis for ‘double-loop learning’ (ques-
tion the very models that generate top-down predictions).
3. Developing abductive attentional engagement at every level of the organization
forms the basis for effective top-down/bottom-up prediction error minimization.
After “noticing an environmental change”, it is essential “to question [one’s]
understanding of how the subsystems of the environment (e.g., technology and
markets) and the organization (e.g., knowledge and goals) are linked” (Shepherd
et al. 2017) without losing sight of the fact that environment is not objectively
deﬁned but a product of action-generated and socially constructed (shared)
meaning and expectations.
The more experience a person has the more they are able to provide quick and plausible
explanations for combinations of circumstances (Isenberg, 1986). Unfortunately, in complex
situations with many interconnected variables, it is often the small details at the periphery,
the weak signals that radically affect how a scenario plays out (Ansoff, 1975). These are the
8.2

least likely factors to ﬁgure in the framing of an experienced manager trained to pay attention
to what resonates with their historical success. (McKenzie et al. 2009)
Indeed, it is a salience trap. While salience is critical to enactive inference, it can
nonetheless potentially increase free energy. To empower abductive sensemaking so
that weak signals can serve as an information-rich enhancement to predictions
processing—listening to what wants to emerge—organizational design is challenged
to neutralize the tendency of experienced managers and board members to
overconﬁdently superimpose the potential fallacy of their historic and self-conﬁdence
powered pattern recognition. Since the human brain’s TPN and DMN spheres are
antagonistically related, the only way to embrace antagonism as duality is by linking in
circular causality top-down predictions and bottom-up stimuli.
Indeed, this ‘real-time switching/vacillation process’ cannot be relegated to a single
person (e.g., CEO or Executive Chairman) or Upper Echelon as a team but must be the
result of an un-supervised and FEP-determined learning process that relates top-down
predictions and bottom-up data input in circular causality to dictate resource
reconﬁguration accordingly. Consequently, the board’s potentially unique DMN
dimension cannot be ignored but must be integrated into this process. At the very
top, the board of directors—given its cognitive diversity in composition and cognitive
distance to the ﬁrm’s dominant TPN exploitation logics—emerges as a monitoring
surveyor of a system that is centered around managing the dynamic interplay of dual
forces (exploitation/exploration and ﬁnancial/strategic control). The board’s traditional
monitoring and advisory roles must be explicitly complemented with a ‘duality
(TPN/DMN) monitoring/management’ mandate.
Traditional corporate governance models have emphasized the board’s TPN
dimension rather than DMN-centric dimensions. It is the TPN/DMN (vacillation)
challenge that further reinforces the call for a new governance approach that is less
concerned with the contents of strategy but dedicated to unsupervised learning
processes fostering purpose-directed top-down/bottom-up surprise minimization in
pursuit of ﬁrm survival. The board’s dynamic capability in form of duality manage-
ment lays the foundation for the board’s newly established governance purpose:
duality stewardship. Once the board embraces the ﬁrm as a free energy principle-
powered generative model and assumes its DMN-centric responsibility to enforce
self-organization by way of enactive inference, the ﬁrm’s prospects for survival are
most likely optimized.

Laying the Foundation
for a Self-Organizing (Autopoietic)
Governance Logic
Abstract Beneath all chaos is an underlying structure. Our challenge is to exploit
disorder’s underlying order. To survive, living organisms are encoded to resist
disorder, i.e., entropy, by way of self-organization. Firms are nothing more than
molecules and are subject to obeying the very same laws of thermodynamics: entropy
will eventually rise. Three speciﬁc propositions, previously developed as part of this
book’s underlying dissertational research, are outlined: (1) STRUCTURE: The stron-
ger a ﬁrm’s cross-hierarchical top-down/bottom-up cognitive (throughput) coupling
between and within governance and operational channels, the less dominant a ﬁrm’s
top-down approach cultivating a form of CEO-centrism in strategy ownership.
(2) COGNITION: The stronger a ﬁrm’s cognitive disposition toward environmental
enactment and innovative abduction as opposed to adaptation, the stronger the ﬁrm’s
strategic control, and the smaller the risk of falling for the ﬁnancial control trap.
(3) CAPABILITIES: The stronger the board’s DMN-centric ‘duality stewardship’
empowering Upper Echelon to sustainably balance exploitation vs. exploration as
well as ﬁnancial vs. strategic control, the stronger the sustainability of successful and
continuous strategic renewal and, hence, the ﬁrm’s prospects for survival. Strategy is
less macroscopic but more subatomic, less linear and determnistic, but more quantum
and discontinuous. There is a dominant tendency of glorifying the ‘realist’ beauty
of top-down linear cause-effect relationships to the very detriment of (quantum)
self-organization.
Free Energy Governance (FEG) is the opening chapter of a new generative logic of
self-organization establishing a number of categorical imperatives guiding
outperformance and survival in random (entropic) market environments:
The fact is, order anywhere in the cosmos is so singular, it always requires an explanatory
mechanism or process, while randomization requires no elucidation – it is simply the way of
the world. When particles are allowed to act randomly, whether as the contents of a glass of
club soda on the rocks or the countless atoms making up the air in the room, they slam into
each other, exchanging energy until complete randomization of their positions and velocities
is observed. (Lanza et al. 2020)
Whether in business or (geo) politics, humanity is trapped in the belief that order
is the norm. To no avail, we keep looking for top-down supervision to impose order

to support the system’s resistance to disorder in its pursuit of non-equilibrium steady
states (NESS). Prediction error minimization ‘cuts out the supervision middleman’
and empowers ‘the perceptual content given in our predictions’ to ‘allow the world
to deliver a supervisory signal’ (Hohwy 2013).
Beneath all chaos is an underlying structure. Our challenge is to exploit disorder’s
underlying order. To survive, living organisms are encoded to resist disorder, i.e.,
entropy, by way of self-organization. Firms are nothing more than molecules and are
subject to obeying the very same laws of thermodynamics. There is no escaping from
thermodynamics’ second law—entropy will eventually rise:
If physical theories were people, thermodynamics would be the village witch. Over the
course of three centuries, she smiled quietly as other theories rose and withered, surviving
major revolutions in physics, like the advent of general relativity and quantum mechanics.
The other theories ﬁnd her somewhat odd, somehow different in nature from the rest, yet
everyone comes to her for advice, and no-one dares to contradict her. Einstein, for instance,
called her ‘the only physical theory of universal content, which I am convinced, that within
the framework of applicability of its basic concepts will never be overthrown.’ Her power
and resilience lay mostly on her frank intentions: thermodynamics has never claimed to be
a means to understand the mysteries of the natural world, but rather a path towards
efﬁcient exploitation of said world. (Goold et al. 2016; emphasis by DBK)
To successfully exploit the dynamics of a given disorder requires less top-down
Upper Echelon intervention but more focus on empowering unsupervised self-
organization. The circular coupling of governance (predictions) and operational
(stimuli) channels in form of prediction error minimization (structure), environmen-
tal engagement in form of enactment rather than adaptation (cognition), and sensing
and sensemaking (capabilities) in form of duality management are the very building
blocks of Free Energy Governance as a generative model of the ﬁrm and its
eco-niche. FEG endows the ﬁrm to exploit the value creation potential that discon-
tinuous environments behold. FEG empowers transitions “from states of ignorance
to states of insight” (Friston et al. 2017).
FEG is a world-disclosing perspective powered by one categorical imperative: the
resolution of equivocality (or VUCA) through purpose-directed, curiosity-driven,
and action-centric prediction error minimization. Eventually, the essence of ﬁrm
outperformance and survival is best captured in one simple and self-evidencing
maxim: free energy minimization by way of prediction error minimization. In
analogy to Goold’s (2016) statement, FEG is not “a means to understand the
mysteries” but provides “a path towards efﬁcient exploitation of said world”.
In the following, speciﬁc propositions are presented which were previously
developed and applied as part of this book’s underlying dissertational research. It
is left to the individual reader to test the propositions’ relevance within one’s very
proprietary context.
Proposition 1: Structure
Cognitive coupling of governance and operational channels—formally and infor-
mally—ensures that dissonant signals can travel frictionless from the ﬁeld level to
Upper Echelon and generatively challenge top-down predictions and underlying
prediction models. The higher the organizational friction in terms of obstructing
bottom-up error messages traveling to and reaching top-down prediction generators,
86

Laying the Foundation for a Self-Organizing (Autopoietic) Governance Logic

the higher free energy (the potential for surprise), and the more likely that top-down
dominant logics fossilize prediction models and, hence, reinforce a ﬁrm’s entropy.
The inter- as well as intra-hierarchical circular connectivity facilitating top-down
belief propagation (predictions) and bottom-up message passing (stimuli) lays the
foundation for generative and unsupervised self-organization.
The board of directors’ effective impact upon strategic renewal—actually, the
impact of any organizational member—is critically determined by the cognitive
coupling of governance and operational channels: a ﬁrm where executive leadership
is emphasizing a top-down approach cultivating a form of CEO-centrism in strategy
ownership, for example, the governance and operational channels are unlikely to be
coupled for the purposes of free energy minimization. Bottom-up message passing is
likely prone to be suffocated by overdominant top-down belief propagation. Con-
sequently, it is just a matter of time for ﬁrm survival to be at risk:
The stronger a ﬁrm’s cross-hierarchical top-down/bottom-up cognitive (throughput)
coupling between and within governance and operational channels, the stronger the
ﬁrm’s orientation toward free energy (surprise) minimization based self-organization, the
less dominant a ﬁrm’s top-down approach cultivating a form of CEO-centrism in
strategy-ownership, the stronger the sustainability of successful and continuous strategic
renewal and, hence, the ﬁrm’s prospects for survival.
Proposition 2: Cognition Cognition in form of world enactment is the purpose-
directed, action-centric, and social construction of ‘shared meaning’ and ‘shared
expectations’, anchored in the understanding that a ﬁrm’s environment is a matter of
environmental engagement in form of interaction revealing ‘signiﬁcance’ and
assigning probabilities to a bounded set of external (unknown) states. It is that
distinctive selection/retention process—anchored in top-down/bottom-up prediction
error minimization—which creates a unique generative interpretation model, i.e., the
ﬁrm’s eco-niche, as a basis for ﬁrm outperformance and survival.
Environmental enactment is not about inventing reality. In fact, there are at least
as many environments as there are economic actors. In a world where technology
cost-effectively empowers exponential growth in energy exchanges rendering the
web of relations and interactions correspondingly more complex, discontinuities are
naturally the new normality. Classical linear cause-effect thinking is no match for
quantum exponentiality. Indeed, the wonderful organizational artefacts that the
brain’s prefrontal cortex has empowered Upper Echelon to mechanistically design
to perfection and impose upon its members, are struggling in quantum environments.
The ﬁrm’s generative model is the ﬁrm’s eco-niche. If uncertainty and
unpredictability dominate our worldly perception, well, then this reﬂects the very
limitations and corrosiveness of our models and the underlying processes generating
those models. There is no objective uncertainty. There is only your uncertainty.
Environment is enacted: each act opens to a new fork of multiple paths leading to
potentially very different outcomes. Reality is a subjective algorithm implying an
inﬁnite number of worlds—in superposition. Our actions not only create the junc-
tures leading to different paths, but we are in control to decide which path to take at
each juncture.

Those who are overwhelmed by ambiguity and uncertainty have disengaged from
the action-centric crafting of their very own destiny. In fact, we are challenged not to
allow for the human brain’s computational limits to solely determine perception and
sensemaking. Instead, outsourcing some of the ‘heavy information lifting’ to the
environment in form of extended cognition is the essence of optimizing prediction-
error-minimization. The more exponential and, hence, discontinuous a market envi-
ronment, the more we need self-organizing mechanisms that leverage the world as a
supervisory signal challenging in circular causality the very perceptual content of
our predictions.
A ﬁrm’s cognitive disposition toward environmental enactment rather than adap-
tation—i.e., embracing the world through the Markovian veil as a purpose-directed,
curious, and action-centric ‘holder of a light torch in the dark’ seeking to reveal
signiﬁcance in equivocality—is fundamentally a matter of free energy minimization.
Revealing (enacting) environmental signiﬁcance is action-generated and socially
constructed at the ﬁrm level. The ‘torch’ is fundamentally guided by a Markov
blanket—our internal assignment of probabilities upon a bounded (most likely) set
of hidden (unknown) external states. Our interactions generate evidence allowing us
to generatively ‘upgrade’ (enhance precision of) that probability assignment.
Determining the signiﬁcance and overall relevance of environmental signals is a
function of the ﬁrm’s explainability and consistency of purpose, predictions, and
underlying prediction models. However, the ultimate organizational power is when
non-salient but potentially transformative/dissonant signals can be ampliﬁed, i.e.,
given signiﬁcance, as they travel bottom-up through the organization to be made
available for Upper Echelon sensemaking, error-minimization, and double-loop-
learning. Fundamentally, it is about continuously opening the ﬁrm’s channels of
listening, in particular listening to what wants to emerge (Scharmer 2018).
A company that embraces the identity and action agenda of a ‘fast and smart
follower’ (a ‘realist’) is unlikely to engage in innovative abduction as a basis for
creating new market opportunities by way of product as well as business model
innovation (Gassmann et al. 2020). The relentless pursuit of adaptation will likely
result in incapacitation of strategic control, foster ﬁnancial control, and, conse-
quently, will lead to surprise at the potential expense of ﬁrm survival:
The stronger a ﬁrm’s cognitive disposition towards environmental enactment and
innovative abduction as opposed to adaptation, the stronger the ﬁrm’s orientation towards
free energy (surprise) minimization based self-organization, the stronger the ﬁrm’s stra-
tegic control and the smaller the risk of falling for the ‘ﬁnancial control trap’, the
stronger the sustainability of successful and continuous strategic renewal and, hence, the
ﬁrm’s prospects for survival.
Proposition 3: Capabilities
TPN/DMN duality management is the cognitive microfoundation of dynamic board
capabilities. Exploitation vs. exploration and ﬁnancial vs. strategic control are two
essential dualities that shape the initiation and sustainability of strategic renewal
pathways. Rather than conceiving the board of directors just as a monitoring,
advisory, or boundary-spanning meta-appendix to the organization, the board must

governance as a TPN/DMN duality management challenge, the board of directors is
likely to be reduced to a rear mirror-trapped, reactive monitoring body, overly
concerned with board effectiveness and ﬁnancial control instead of continuous
strategic renewal as a basis for ﬁrm outperformance and survival. Consequently,
the board of directors is at risk to be relegated to strategic irrelevance or, possibly
worse, a source of entropy-bound inertia.
While duality management capabilities are not strictly limited to the board and
while they are equally critical capabilities at the top and middle management levels,
the board of directors, due to its cognitive distance to TPN-centric exploitation
logics, is best positioned to assume this duality stewardship role. An overemphasis
on external innovation and growth (e.g., by way of M&A and joint ventures) is likely
to weaken the focus on internal R&D and eventually compromises the ﬁrm’s
strategic control and consequently survival.
Therefore, DMN-centric duality management is critical for success of continuous
‘wholesale renewal’. Essentially, the board’s sensing and sensemaking capabilities
must ensure that executive leadership’s dominant and exploitation-centric logics, as
expressed in predictions and underlying prediction models, remain challenged by
bottom-up resource market stimuli to optimally balance exploitation/exploration and
ﬁnancial/strategic control. The board is the purveyor and surveyor of the ﬁrm’s
generative model, empowering self-organization by way of free-energy minimization:

as
ﬁnancial vs. strategic control, the stronger the ﬁrm’s orientation towards free energy
(surprise) minimization based self-organization, the stronger the sustainability of success-
ful and continuous strategic renewal and, hence, the ﬁrm’s prospects for survival.
In summary, the board must assume the role of sponsor (or enforcer) of three
categorical imperatives deﬁning the success and sustainability of strategic renewal
and ﬁrm survival:
(1) Foster cognitive coupling between and within all hierarchical layers: Process
follows structure, and strategy follows process (structure).
(2) Embrace environment as action-generated and socially constructed ‘shared
meaning’ and ‘shared expectations’: Environment must be enacted as a matter
of purpose-directed revealing of signiﬁcance and valence rather than taken as an
exogenously given object awaiting top-down-directed adaptation. Nothing exists
in the absence of a relation and interaction with its external world and we are in
control of selecting relations and actions (cognition).
(3) De-chain the ﬁrm from thinking in terms of antagonisms, but embrace real-time
duality management as a critical determinant of performance and survival:
Exploration vs. exploitation as well as ﬁnancial vs. strategic control, respec-
tively, do not co-exist but form a mutually reinforcing real-time duality. We are
challenged to embrace the world’s interdependently opposing forces less as
paradox but as dualities in synchronicity (capabilities).
In sum, [move] beyond the old doctrine of strategy, structure, and systems to a softer, more
organic model built on the development of purpose, process, and people [. . .] Before senior

managers can realign behavior and beliefs throughout the corporation, they need to change
their own priorities and ways of thinking. (Bartlett and Goshal 1994)
Strategy is less macroscopic but more subatomic, less linear and deterministic but
more quantum and discontinuous. Our hierarchical model (structure), our concep-
tion of reality construction (cognition), and the ﬁrm’s capability to empower inter-
dependencies not as opposing forces but dualities (capabilities) will determine the
success of strategic renewal and, ultimately, the survivability of the very ﬁrm the
board of directors has been entrusted to govern.
To date, neither strategy process nor corporate governance research has devel-
oped a cross-hierarchical framework to match the very demands for continuous
strategic renewal in an increasingly distributed and discontinuous world. There are
many possible reasons for this shortfall. But above all, it is this dominant tendency—
as much in the world of practice as in academic research—of glorifying the ‘realist’
beauty of top-down linear cause-effect relationships that crowds out quantum self-
organization.

Conclusion
Designers who erect an organizational palace had better anticipate problems caused by
shifting subsoils. [. . .] pursuing stability and avoiding uncertainty interfere with an organi-
zation’s [. . .] survival.
Residents of changing environments need a tent. [. . .] an organizational tent neither asks
for harmony between the activities of different organizational components, nor asks that
today’s behavior resemble yesterday’s or tomorrow’s.
Those who live in an organizational tent [. . .] invent sensors for alerting themselves to
signiﬁcant events, and ceaselessly question their present assumptions and habits (Landau,
1973). They remain ready to replace old methods, and they discard even adequate old
methods in order to try new ones, looking upon each development as an experiment that
suggests new experiments. [. . .] They regard their organization as a means, not an end
(White, 1969). They avoid anchoring their satisfactions in the roles and procedures.
[They] draw satisfactions from the skills and relationships that contribute to processes—
the processes generating the organization to come.
The desired balance can be caricatured with six aphorisms: (1) cooperation requires
minimal consensus; (2) satisfaction rests upon minimal contentment; (3) wealth arises from
minimal afﬂuence; (4) goals merit minimal faith; (5) improvement depends on minimal
consistency; and (6) wisdom demands minimal rationality.

Chapter 10
Free Energy Governance vs. Traditional
Corporate Governance
Abstract Through the lens of the theoretical concepts developed in this book, FEG
and traditional corporate governance (TCG) are assessed in comparative perspective.
TCG models are predominantly characterized by a compliance mentality centered
around board effectiveness as a matter of managing (agency) conﬂicts of interests
through optimizing stereotypical board diversity and enforcing director independence.
FEG introduces a radically new logic exercising the ‘corporate wholesale reinvention’
that strategic renewal is now imposing. Indeed, any such juxtaposition of two gover-
nance logics can hardly escape the accusation of oversimpliﬁcation. However, once
we embrace the world as discontinuous and distributed, we start understanding that
today’s entrenched corporate governance approaches are a ‘low-scale, low-leverage
legacy business’, breeding inertia. Public policy prescribed ‘best practices’ guiding
corporate governance is an anachronism of modern business, reinforcing Upper
Echelon’s risk-averseness (i.e., compromising epistemic foraging) and, consequently,
entrapment in the incapacitating perception of the world as VUCA (volatile, uncertain,
complex, and ambiguous). FEG embraces any dimension of VUCA as information-
rich input for top-down/bottom-up prediction error minimization in pursuit of mini-
mizing surprise. An overreliance on CEO-framed information ﬂows and analysis,
which is so characteristic of TCG, is as good as ﬂipping a coin: the very processes
that explain success equally breed failure.
Through the lens of the theoretical concepts developed in this book, we must even-
tually reckon the governance revolution that is calling upon us to set free the full
potential of the social action ﬁeld that continues to be called, rather archaically, a ﬁrm,
implying something solid, unyielding, and unlikely to change. Traditional corporate
governance (TCG) models (for an overview, see Hilb 2012) are essentially character-
ized by a compliance mentality centered upon managing (agency) conﬂicts of interests
by way of optimizing stereotypical board diversity and enforcing director indepen-
dence. Indeed, among TCG models, there is a range of types of boards, varying in
degrees from shareholder value to stakeholder centrism, from predominantly unitary to
dual structures (e.g., Germany), and from collaborative (stewardship) to control
(agency) orientation:

We apply agency and stewardship theories to detail contrasting, yet potentially complemen-
tary, approaches to governance. Rooted in economics and ﬁnance, agency theory informs a
control approach aimed at curbing self-serving behaviors of managers (agents) that may
negatively impact owners’ (principals) wealth (Eisenhardt, 1989). Stewardship theory
details a collaborative approach, tapping insights from sociology and psychology. Propo-
nents of this approach strive to enhance board-management ties and decision making by
empowering managers (stewards) of the ﬁrm. (Sundaramurthy and Lewis 2003)
Free Energy Governance (FEG) introduces a radically new logic. FEG represents
a logical match to the ‘corporate wholesale reinvention’ that strategic renewal is now
imposing: “more caterpillar-to-butterﬂy process, moving gracefully from one way of
working to an entirely new one, replacing corporate body parts and ways of
functioning completely in some cases to capture far more value than was possible
using low-scale, low-leverage legacy business” (Siebel 2019; quoting Hinchcliffe,
D. on distinguishing digitization from digital transformation).
Table 10.1 summarizes FEG vs. TCG and highlights the very new dimensions
along which a governance model should be assessed.
Indeed, any such juxtaposition of two governance philosophies or logics can hardly
escape the accusation of oversimpliﬁcation. But then, we only crystalize the ‘spectrum
of truth’ through extremes. Once we embrace the world as discontinuous and distrib-
uted—mandating continuous strategic renewal—and once we deﬁne strategy process
as top-down/bottom-up prediction error minimization in pursuit of surprise minimi-
zation, we start understanding that today’s entrenched corporate governance
approaches are a ‘low-scale, low-leverage legacy business’. This is in particular true
when we consider the very absence of deep purpose (Gulati 2022) that a majority of
business enterprises is struggling with. Without deep purpose, predictions-processing
is nonsensical. TCG has entirely ignored the existential importance of deep purpose as
integral to the governance mandate. Deep purpose is not top-down imposed but
discovered from within—top-down/bottom-up—and must be continuously re-
interpreted over time. The board must be the sponsor and guarantor of this process.
In physics, the world is divided into those (realists) who ﬁrmly believe that “there is
a real world out there, whose properties in no way depend on our knowledge or
perception of it” (Smolin 2020) and those who “believe that the properties we ascribe
to atoms and elementary particles are not inherent in those objects, but are created only
by our interactions with them, and exist only at the time when we measure them”.
Equally, entrenched governance models are trapped in the ‘realist’ logic that
environment is ‘out there’ to be analyzed and adapted to rather than being en-acted
through ‘real-world’ relations and inter-actions. Classical physics considers the latter
position as fundamentally ‘antirealist’. Indeed, Free Energy Governance is funda-
mentally ‘antirealist’. Being ‘antirealist’ is the essence of competitive advantage in a
discontinuous and distributed world and lays the foundation for self-organization.
The internal logic of the Free Energy Governance framework should be freestand-
ing as both a new logic of organizing as well as an early-warning system predicting
entropic decay putting ﬁrm survival eventually at risk. Indeed, “the grander the
theoretical claims, the more free-standing the theory has to be. In other words, even
if a reader were only to read the conceptual part of the paper, he or she would be
convinced of the internal logic of the conceptual argument” (Siggelkow 2007).
The free energy principle is a ﬁrst-order principle underlying self-organization.

unsupervised self-organization. Therefore, survival is essentially about bottom-up
and purpose-directed selecting and empowering of stimuli/signals to challenge top-
down predictions and underlying prediction models, in circular causality. Error and
surprise are information-rich and should feed predictions processing in real-time:

survival” (Hedberg et al. 1976). To minimize surprise, one must actively seek it in
the ﬁrst place by way of epistemic foraging.
Public policy prescribed best practices guiding corporate governance is an anach-
ronism of modern business, reinforcing Upper Echelon’s entrapment in the incapac-
itating perception of the world as VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and
ambiguous). Free Energy Governance embraces any dimension of VUCA as
information-rich input for top-down/bottom-up prediction error minimization in
pursuit of minimizing surprise. An overreliance on CEO-framed information ﬂows
and analysis, which is so characteristic of TCG, is as good as ﬂipping a coin: the very
processes that breed success equally breed failure.

Implications for Management Practice
Abstract ‘How can one possibly redeﬁne the board’s strategic meta-role when
traditional governance modes are so ubiquitously entrenched and cognitive capabili-
ties so poorly developed or non-manifest?’ To be practice-relevant, theory must be
intuitive and inspire Upper Echelon questioning its very Habits of Mind. To conceive
strategic renewal as a continuous and generative process of top-down predictions/
bottom-up stimuli surprise minimization urges Upper Echelon to consequently opti-
mize the multi-intelligent sources of stimuli, redesign processes as well as incentive
structures, and develop a new language to empower enactive inference. Indeed, to
date, corporate governance research and practice are more concerned with deﬁning
behavioral responsibilities rather than addressing its very capability needs. There is no
‘one size ﬁts all’ best-practices-catalogue, but FEG’s nexus of structure, cognition, and
capabilities provides the building blocks for a fundamentally new governance logic. In
a discontinuous world, the essential governance challenge is to ensure the self-
organizing optimization of top-down/bottom-up prediction error minimization: learn-
ing to infer. Once we embrace FEG as a novel organizational framework and early
detector of a ﬁrm’s impending entropic decay, we must reckon that unless replaced
with a FEG-inspired logic, TCG is likely to continue relegating the board of directors
to strategic irrelevance, reinforce ﬁnancial control at the expense of strategic control,
prioritize top-down content over top-down/bottom-up process, cultivate inertia, and
inhibit the full growth and survival potential of ﬁrms as self-organizing systems.
The relevance of theory to the practice of stategy management and governance is
essentially determined by three dimensions. Theory must:
•
Be intuitive as well as ‘problem- or opportunity-driven’ (Corley and Gioia 2011).
•
Establish new metaphors or give new meaning to existing language that
empowers purposeful sensing, sensemaking, and strategic renewal.

•
Inspire Upper Echelon questioning its very Habits of Mind, i.e., provide a new
and enriching perspective around ‘doing things differently’.
Theory building is also a product of its time: “identify domains that will soon be
in need of theorizing” (Corley and Gioia 2011). Accelerating disintermediation,
decentralization, and de-/re-localization demand a new (and intuitive) logic of
organizing. To conceive strategic renewal as a continuous and generative process
of top-down predictions/bottom-up stimuli error/surprise minimization is a novel
framework urging Upper Echelon to consequently redesign processes, incentive
structures, language, and communication.
Free Energy Governance provides rich and new meaning to existing concepts and
establishes new relationships:
(1) Top-down/bottom-up prediction processing is applied to strategic management
and deﬁned in form of a generative process—integrating in circular causality
top-down belief propagation and bottom-up message passing—in pursuit of one
objective: minimize surprise to resist entropy to persist, powered by one
ﬁrst-order principle of least action, i.e., free energy minimization. A purpose-
directed ﬁrm is the foundation for Free Energy Governance’s top-down/bottom-
up circular causality to come and stay alive.
Steve Jobs, for example, seeded a timeless purpose for Apple, so tangible in
everything we have come to expect from Apple products and services. Product
innovation and delivery, however, are a function of uncompromising ‘fail fast’
generative prediction error minimization that engages not only a visionary founder
and the entire ﬁrm (top-down/bottom-up) but also its ecosystems: enactive infer-
ence conditioned by Markovian blankets upon blankets. Purpose is the axiom of
strategic prediction models (worldviews, long-term target models). Purpose
should be timeless but must be continuously re-interpreted in the very context of
the ﬁrm’s time and space. “The world we want tomorrow starts with the business
we build today.” (Mars purpose statement quoted in Gulati 2022)
Predictions could be wild guesses, and this is most likely how some of the
most transformative inventions and innovations have kicked off—in someone’s
mind and most likely that very abductive mind is located close to resource
markets (e.g., clients, suppliers, technology) rather than within Upper Echelon.
Indeed, action-generated bottom-up stimuli emanating from resource markets
are the very oxygen fueling the continuous re-interpretation of purpose, predic-
tion models, and predictions to empower ﬁrm performance and survival.
Human nature is innately social and participatory. However, the organiza-
tion’s ﬁeld levels tend to be rather introverted and risk averse and are too often
overly concerned with job security or reluctant to assuming more responsibility.
Therefore, the bottom close to resource markets—where transformation-bearing
signals pass through—is likely to resist airing ideas and sharing market signals
that contradict dominant top-down predictions and prediction models. In fact,
the more sharing-reluctant the ﬁrm’s ﬁeld (close to resource markets), the more
likely that the ﬁrm is too (narcissistically) top-down directed and eventually will
have no other choice but to turn to an over-emphasis of ﬁnancial control with
potentially survival-threatening consequences. Effectively, there is not sufﬁcient
bottom-up oxygen to power top-down strategic control.

Implications for Management Practice

Our understanding of the ﬁrm’s cognition must be more extended rather than
corporate-centric. This requires openness to a vast array of sources of stimuli to
be revealed and assessed for purpose-directed signiﬁcance to be then related to
top-down/bottom-up prediction processing. Top-down/bottom-up prediction
error minimization is empowering the ﬁrm to fully leverage the multi-
intelligence dimension of the human-machine interface.
Upper Echelon communication is centered around four dimensions, dynam-
ically linked in FEG’s circular causality: (a) purpose, (b) prediction models,
(c) predictions, and (d) stimuli. The simplicity and plasticity of the language are
critical to ensure that reach and inclusion of team members are optimized. More
importantly, ﬁrm members must be incentivized to stimuli challenge predictions.
Underlying prediction models, according to the ﬁrst-order free energy minimi-
zation principle, will self-evidently evolve by way of (unsupervised) self-
organization (STRUCTURE).
(2) Enactment, coined by Karl Weick (1977) and astutely applied by Smirchich and
Stubbart (1984) to strategy process, has conceptually inspired FEG. By now, the
reader should see that it is too obvious what a nonsense the idea of an objective
reality is, as much as uncertainty is not an objective but an actor-dependent
experience. However, enactment in terms of Weick’s ‘legislating’ a ﬁrm’s oper-
ating and competitive landscape has been too vague and top-down-centric to really
provide the world of practice with more than a conceptually appealing black box.
The concept of the Markov blanket—separating the inner from the outer
world through the veil of internally generated probability assignments upon a
bounded set of external (unknown) states and governed by the interplay of action
and feedback loops in pursuit of free energy minimization—is providing strat-
egy process and corporate governance with an entirely new conception of self as
well as eco-niche construction. Enactment is redeﬁned as enactive inference.
Essentially, Free Energy Governance is liberating Upper Echelon from the
overwhelming cognitive distortion that their biggest challenge is taming
(Hertwig et al. 2019) uncertainty when, instead, they should be really surﬁng
(Clark 2016) it. Unless environment is redeﬁned as a purpose-directed and
action-centric generative prediction challenge in form of prediction error mini-
mization, ﬁrms will continue being incapacitated by the fateful pursuit of
adaptive ﬁtness. More importantly, redeﬁning strategy as top-down/bottom-up
predictive coding lays the foundation to optimally leverage and co-evolve the
human-machine potential (COGNITION).
(3) Dynamic board capabilities in form of duality management are an entirely new
genre of Upper Echelon capabilities that FEG establishes. To date, corporate
governance practice is more concerned with deﬁning behavioral responsibilities
rather than addressing its speciﬁc capability needs. Board capabilities are not of an
operational (executive) nature but must be meta-operational. Sensing and
sensemaking, though not novel concepts in strategy management research, will
need to be more effectively operationalized beyond their conceptional appeal.
Enactive prediction processing becomes manifest in duality management in form
of balancing ﬁnancial and strategic control as well as exploitation and exploration.
Duality management is all about probabilistic resource-reconﬁgurations in

superposition waiting to be enacted. ‘Duality stewardship’ is FEG’s essential
governance mandate.
The concepts of ﬁnancial and strategic control have been deﬁned in multiple
ways, in both corporate governance and management research. Hitt et al.’s
deﬁnition (Hitt et al. 1996) of relating the concepts to external and internal
innovation, respectively, and empirically distilling the survival-threatening
implications resulting from overdependence on ﬁnancial control, for example,
provide Upper Echelon with a critical early-warning dimension for corporate
entropy. More importantly, it establishes a strategic imperative: do not ever
allow for ﬁnancial control to crowd out strategic control. The R&D percentage
share of total revenues is potentially a good indicator of a looming ﬁnancial
control trap. Within each industry, there is a rough percentage benchmark for
R&D investment for organic reinvention. Once a ﬁrm operates year-on-year
below industry R&D investment standards, ﬁnancial control is likely to be the
only control left (CAPABILITIES).
How to make it all work in practice is a daunting task. There is no best-practices
catalogue. First of all, best practices should be considered a potential source of
inertia. We need ﬁrst-order principles to empower structural organization (formal
and informal throughput), environmental engagement, and capability development
to foster self-organizing processes. Free Energy Governance does exactly this. FEG
is a new logic, and that means that its implementation is also a matter of a new
mindset and culture. Above all, it axiomatically starts with the ﬁrm-wide adoption of
a deep purpose (Gulati 2022). Fostering a culture of wild guesses (predictions) in
form of innovative abduction to be challenged across all hierarchical levels is an
essential free energy foundation for performance and survival. Indeed, we must ask:
How can one possibly redeﬁne the board’s strategic ‘meta-role’ when traditional gover-
nance modes are so ubiquitously entrenched and cognitive capabilities so poorly developed
or non-manifest?
The dissertational research underlying this book publication revealed that prac-
titioners have strategic goals and variably emphasize ﬁnancial or strategic control
dimensions. But they may lack clarity around the ﬁrm’s purpose. ‘Why should this
business exist and prevail in the ﬁrst place?’ is an important question too rarely
asked. Survival, ﬁrst and foremost, is a matter of staying relevant.
Questioning the very right to existence of a business is a good starting point to
distill and reinterpret its purpose. In this context, Jan Ståhlberg, one of the early
architects building EQT into a USD80bn-plus leading global PE investor, explains
PE’s public market equivalent peer outperformance:
Indeed, private equity should outperform public companies for a number of reasons: First,
PE has more strategic freedom. We constantly question the status quo. Public boards are
dedicated to what they have. They rarely question the existing business. Second, we
neutralize any potential conﬂicts of interest and build alignment of interests so that the
collective power of all involved can be optimally leveraged for a long-term goal. Third,
optimal capital allocation is a key value-driver. Public companies have more difﬁculty in
convincing markets to over-capitalize for future growth opportunities. Fourth, at least at
EQT, a paranoia-powered sense of urgency has always been part of our DNA. (Ståhlberg
2021)
100
11
Implications for Management Practice

“Private equity is best understood not as a ﬁnancing method but as a governance
structure” (Klein et al. 2013). In fact, PE-sponsored governance approaches have
moved into a diametrically opposite direction relative to public market (best practices)
governance models. This should largely explain PE’s consistent outperformance of
public market equivalent peers for the past 20 years. “According to Harris et al. (2014),
top quartile buyout fund outperformance relative to the S&P 500 has consistently
averaged at least 20-27% over a fund’s life and more than 3% annually. This
conclusion is relatively insensitive to assumptions about benchmark indices and
systematic risk” (Khezri 2015). Against this background, it is rather logical to expect
PE being one of the fastest growing ﬁnancial asset classes for years, if not decades, to
come. It is a matter of PE’s superior governance model. FEG guides the direction to
further perfect the PE governance logic.
If the public at large is to participate in the innovation economy,1 we must
fundamentally revise public market governance regulations. Governance may not
be the root cause for the ‘eclipse of the public corporation’ as Michael Jensen (1989)
labeled the phenomenon. But unless we advance governance models that match the
challenges of a distributed and discontinuous world, overall trust in the governance
of the public company and its performance potential will fade.
Jan Ståhlberg’s practice-relevant statements (Ståhlberg 2021) concerning trans-
parency, communication, and reaching out to the bottom should inspire management
practice:
•
We operated on the basis that ‘everyone should know’. Everyone is informed in real-
time about everything. Indeed, this may lead to an overload of information, but overall
this is still preferable than top-down ﬁltering that may risk excluding potentially insight-
ful stimuli and feedback. How did we manage this: we allowed everyone in the ﬁrm to
listen into the investment calls, for example. It was a brilliant move. While other PE ﬁrms
cultivated ‘closed doors’, we embraced such openness as a major learning platform,
training young professionals to understand our sense of urgency, paranoia, long-term
focus and, not least, our principles. More importantly, we often beneﬁted from insights
we would have not accessed otherwise. Our organizational structure has never been
cascaded. And, I believe, looking at some of the core propositions of Free Energy
Governance, this is Free Energy Governance: connecting top and bottom in circular
causality of sensemaking with the least friction and optimal response time.
•
Overall, I think as long as people are open-minded, the composition of the board is not
the problem. Communication is everything. Value creation, in my experience, has been
usually determined by a combination of the following governance imperatives: First,
you must start with a clear purpose and long-term goal. Prepare to invest for the long-
term, and into structure. Second, you need to continuously question yourself. Paranoia is
key. Third, team-decisions are critical. Create a culture that empowers and encourages
people to contribute, to take decisions, and not to be risk-averse. Team-decisions are an
optimal way to get the best out of everyone. Fourth, the organization must be open and
transparent; no room for politics. When I was running the global Mid-Market operations
out of New York, I was known for ‘walking around’, watering plants and putting my
coffee cup in the dishwasher. You cannot expect bottom-up stimuli reaching the top
when the top is not reaching out to the bottom. And sometimes a simple walk through the
ofﬁce can make all the difference. Listen humble and with respect. In summary, it really
comes down to three things: communication, transparency, and respect.

As always, the speciﬁc needs and challenges of a ﬁrm’s given lifecycle determine
the relative emphasis of top-down (belief-propagation) and bottom-up (message-
passing): “The various experiences I’ve had, ranging from starting America Online,
to chairing a merged AOL/Time Warner, to backing entrepreneurs via Revolution, or
by helping to oversee public institutions like the Smithsonian, lead me to conclude
that governance cannot be viewed in a vacuum—what is appropriate really
depends on the context in which you’re operating. A ‘one size ﬁts all’ approach
will likely be ﬂawed” (Case 2021).
Indeed, “one size ﬁts all” is a ﬂawed approach, and “where you are in the ﬁrm’s
lifecycle” is essential. However, to emphasize either a top-down or bottom-up
leadership approach as a function of lifecycle and context does pre-suppose, in the
ﬁrst place, that a ﬁrm has built the foundation to ‘vacillate’ and autonomously
determine the level of emphasis of top-down dominance or top-down/bottom-up
circular causality. Maintaining that agility is a strategic imperative in pursuit of ﬁrm
survival. Otherwise, the ﬁrm’s strategic options are narrowing toward the top-down-
only comfort zone, most likely ending up capitulating to the dictate of ﬁnancial
control, condemning the ﬁrm to M&A and joint ventures only to secure growth and
innovation at the price of eventually losing strategic control.
We are challenged to exit dominant logics to truly embrace the world as distrib-
uted and discontinuous. In practice, continuous strategic renewal is organizing’s
categorical imperative. Traditional corporate governance models are likely to con-
tinue compromising the full performance potential of executive leadership as they
tend to relegate the board of directors to strategic irrelevance, reinforce ﬁnancial
control at the expense of strategic control, prioritize fast (pattern-recognition-fueled)
content over slow process, and eventually inhibit the full growth potential of ﬁrms as
self-organizing systems.
The very causes supporting Siebel’s statement that we “are in the midst of an
evolutionary punctuation: [. . .] witnessing a mass extinction in the corporate world”
(Siebel 2019) are, amongst other, reﬂective of the unsuitability of our governance
models to translate free energy principle-based machine learning logics into orga-
nizing. In today’s discontinuous market environments, CEOs are under accelerating
pressure to resist entropy. Firm survival takes center stage. Boards are in danger of
being rather survival-inhibiting; notwithstanding individual members’ best inten-
tions and outstanding capabilities (though, too often non-manifest or domain-centric
and past experience-trapped).
This is not necessarily so because board members are incompetent, ignorant, or
victims of debilitating group dynamics and cognitive ‘blind spots’ but because the
essential governance challenge in a discontinuous and distributed world is now a
matter of setting free the self-organizing optimization of top-down/bottom-up pre-
diction error minimization: learning to infer. The ﬁrm is the generative model. The
continuous nature of strategic renewal makes prediction modeling as well as pre-
diction error minimization an integral and DMN-centric dimension of traditional
monitoring, advisory, and boundary-spanning board responsibilities. Effectively, in
the absence of board-level meta-capabilities, as developed in this book, the board
can no longer fulﬁll even its most basic and traditional responsibilities.
102
11
Implications for Management Practice

Free Energy Governance should be embraced as (a) practically intuitive, (b) a
practice-oriented framework providing a new language empowering the human-
machine interface’s full potential as well as giving new meaning to existing orga-
nizational language as well as establishing new metaphors facilitating intra-ﬁrm
communication and engagement, and (c) providing Upper Echelon with a funda-
mentally new survival-centric governance framework deﬁning strategy process as
prediction error minimization, thus, empowering ‘doing things differently’. The
demands upon organizational design, a ﬁrm’s environmental engagement model,
as well as board capabilities are signiﬁcant. Hard structures, fossilizing prediction
models beyond bottom-up challenge, should be recognized as a survival-threatening
relic of the past.
From a practice perspective, Free Energy Governance is both a novel organiza-
tional framework and an early detector of a ﬁrm’s looming entropic decay:
Might it be possible to detect decline early and reverse course, or even better, might we be
able to practice preventive medicine? I began to think of decline as analogous to a disease,
perhaps like cancer, that can grow on the inside while you still look strong and healthy on the
outside [. . .] Yet our research indicates that organizational decline is largely self-inﬂicted,
and recovery largely within our control. (Collins 2009)

Implications for Management Practice

Chapter 12
Future Research Agenda
Abstract FEG is the product of a multidisciplinary research project connecting the
dots among strategy, governance, and neuroscience research opening a new conver-
sation headlined ‘introducing the free energy principle to strategy management’.
FEG redeﬁnes the nexus of structure and cognition (ABV), advances the dynamic
capability view (DCV) from the managerial to the board level, and establishes
strategy as an enactive (Bayesian) inference challenge. In terms of future research,
four areas should advance the optimization of FEG: (1) language and communica-
tion, in particular explainability of corporate purpose, prediction models, and pre-
dictions; (2) embodied cognition, in terms of a deeper understanding around the
neurobiology underlying leadership’s world engagement as well as false inference;
(3) artiﬁcial intelligence, in particular the strategy application of Ai-powered machine
algorithms; and (4) board capabilities’ developmental paths, in particular the board’s
ability to collectively develop meta-capabilities. FEG as a framework provides the
fundamental building blocks that empower a ﬁrm to implement free energy minimi-
zation as a self-organizing principle: structure (top-down/bottom-up connectivity),
cognition (environmental enactment), and capabilities (duality management). Within
the FEG framework, many vibrant strategy research topics lend themselves to be
repurposed as a matter of optimizing free-energy minimization. More speciﬁcally,
survival rather than just performance is the critical dependent variable.
Free Energy Governance is introduced as the opening of a new conversation
headlined ‘introducing the free energy principle to strategy management’. Speciﬁ-
cally in terms of implications relating to theory, the FEG framework: (1) redeﬁnes
and reinforces the nexus of structure and cognition (ABV), (2) advances the dynamic
capability view (DCV) from the managerial to the board level and establishes duality
management as a dynamic board capability, and (3) applies neuroscience’s ﬁrst-
order free energy minimization principle to organizational governance, effectively
establishing strategy as an enactive, sophisticated, and resource-dependent Bayesian
inference challenge.
FEG is not a substitute for traditional agency or stewardship theories or any
combination thereof. Epistemologically, FEG is rooted in strategic cognition

research and aspires to be a fundamentally new logic of organizing linking structure,
cognition, and capabilities. If, indeed, a ﬁrm’s long-term strategic capacity for
sustainable outperformance and survival is axiomatically determined by the depth
of the ﬁrm’s (existential) purpose and the ﬁrm-level capability of (1) revealing
environmental signiﬁcance (listening to what wants to emerge)—resulting from
the ﬁrm’s very interactions with the many worlds that eventually shape a distinctive
interpretation—and (2) reconﬁguring resources correspondingly, then we need a
framework that goes beyond anything proposed so far. We need a new logic.
Free Energy Governance is the product of a multidisciplinary research project
connecting the dots among strategy, governance, and neuroscience research. Short-
comings in existing strategy and governance research that have inspired this book’s
underlying dissertation have been addressed in previous sections. In terms of future
research, the following four areas are worth considering for advancing the optimi-
zation of Free Energy Governance: (1) language and communication, (2) embodied
cognition, (3) artiﬁcial intelligence, and (4) board capabilities’ developmental paths.
12.1
Language and Communication
The effectiveness of FEG is critically determined by transparency in communication,
speciﬁcally around the explainability of corporate purpose, prediction models, and
predictions “to obtain the most possible human energy for productive effort”
(Argyris 1995). Helfat and Peteraf (2015) linked language and communication as
a cognitive microfoundation underlying the effective reconﬁguration of a ﬁrm’s
resource base. Theories of communication should fertilize FEG-related (practice-
oriented) research:
[T]here is no organization nor any ideology other than that which emerges in communica-
tion. If organization is emergent in communication, as we believe, then it is not a being, but a
becoming. What we ought to be studying is not organization or ideology, because neither has
any ontological status independent of communication, but the processes of communication
by which we continue to construct both to become the world we live in. (Taylor and Van
Every 2000)
Upper Echelon is well advised to re-develop awareness for both (1) its agency
status in form of “responsibility to act that confers legitimacy on the action” (Taylor
2009) and (2) how organizing emerges in language and action. The avalanche of
scripts and presentations that circulate within companies to impose top-down-dom-
inant logics is more likely to be free energy-maximizing than -minimizing. Corpo-
rate communication is inherently geared toward anesthetizing the individual’s
capability for abductive thinking, preventing its members to listen and hear what
truly wants to emerge.
Strategy process scholars are increasingly turning to the importance of the
communication dimension to reﬁne existing theories. More speciﬁcally, Helfat and
Peteraf (2015) concerning DCV and Burgelman et al.’s (2018) concerning ABV, for
example, are exemplary. When Maturana writes (as quoted in Taylor 2009) that
106
12
Future Research Agenda

“[l]anguage occurs only in the ﬂow of coordination of recursive consensual actions
between organisms caught up in continuing interaction,” we might as well replace
language with reality. Indeed, “[q]uantum physics more than the immensity of the
universe and the discovery of its great history, more even than the extraordinary
vision of Einstein, has been [. . .] the heart of this radical questioning of our mental
maps of reality” (Rovelli 2021).
In this context, it is worth recalling biocentrism’s ninth principle (Lanza et al.
2020):
There are several basic relationships – called “forces” – that the mind uses to construct
reality. They have their roots in the logic of how various components of the information
system interact with each other to create the 3-D experience we call consciousness or reality.
Each force describes how bits of energy interact at different levels, starting with the strong
and weak forces (which govern how particles hold together or fall apart in the nucleus of
atoms) and moving up to electromagnetism and then gravity (which dominates interactions
on astronomical scales such as the behavior of solar systems and galaxies).
Language is not a tool but a force. Indeed, “[c]omplex organization [. . .] emerges
in a superordinate metaconversation where all the conversations of the organiza-
tion’s members, including its own, have become its object of focus” (Taylor 2009).
From this perspective, it is so much more intuitive to appreciate that domain
expertise and operational capabilities, respectively, are not enough to actively lead
this ‘superordinate meta-conversation’ at the board level where it should be
anchored. The board is challenged to develop new meta-capabilities accordingly.
Organizational sensemaking has traditionally relied on evocative language,
scripts, and framing (e.g., threats vs. opportunities). But as we embrace organizing
as a ‘dense web of interactions’ (Rovelli 2021) dedicated to enactive inference
conditioned by the Markov blanket, we must appreciate that “this focus on verbal
processes to the exclusion of embodied processes does not sufﬁciently encompass
the scope of sensegiving” (O’Malley et al. 2009). In fact, the form and reach of our
interactions with the outside world as a basis for enacting, i.e., perceiving reality, are
fundamentally a function of our respective bodily energies and constituencies
crystalizing in language and actions.
12.2
Embodied Cognition
Firms are challenged to develop an appreciation for the neurobiology underlying
Upper Echelon’s world engagement as a basis for reality construction and must
redeﬁne the nexus of body-mind-action-language. In The Hour Between Dog and
Wolf, trader-turned-neuroscientist John Coates (2012) details the neurobiology
explaining boom and bust in ﬁnancial markets. Coates’ systemic application of the
neurobiology underlying embodied cognition is equally relevant to Upper Echelon
confronting environmental scarcity:
If dopamine fuels a desire for information and unexpected reward, perhaps it also ﬁlls us
with a burning curiosity. [. . .] Importantly, dopamine, like noradrenaline, does a lot more
12.2
Embodied Cognition
107

than motivate the brain: it also prepares the body for action. [. . .] Dopamine drives us to push
beyond established routines and to try new search patterns and hunting techniques. [. . .] If a
crisis lasts longer than ﬁght-or-ﬂight, then the shell of the adrenal glands [. . .] secrets ever
increasing amounts of cortisol. [. . .] Novelty, uncertainty and uncontrollability – the three
conditions are similar in that when subjected to them we have no downtime, but are in a
constant state of preparedness. [. . .] But now, under heavy load of stress [. . .] a person can
no longer concentrate and instead scans the environment, the reason being that when
confronted with true novelty we no longer know what is relevant and what to focus
on. [. . .] Cortisol’s lethal effects on the brain are compounded by another chemical produced
during stress, one produced in the amygdala called CRH [. . .] CRH in the brain instills
anxiety and what is called ‘anticipatory angst’, a general fear of the world leading to timid
behavior. [E]volution has equipped us with a stress response that can be fatally dysfunctional
in modern society. [C]an we turn off the cortisol? [. . .] Our conscious and rational selves
have very little control over subcortical parts of the brain such as the amygdala, the
hypothalamus and the brain stem. [M]ental toughness involves a particular attitude to
novel events: a toughened individual welcomes novelty as a challenge, sees in it an
opportunity for gain; an untoughened individual dreads it as a threat [. . .] What is intriguing
about the research into toughness is the ﬁnding that to each of these attitudes – viewing
novelty as a challenge or as a threat – there corresponds a distinctive physiological state.
Embodied cognition (EC) and the emotional signiﬁcance of stimuli are gaining
momentum in cognitive science. Indeed, the brain is not the only cognitive resource.
Brain, body, and environment together form one integrated cognitive (embodied/
enactive/extended) system. While the prediction processing framework (PPF) is
rooted in a number of EC’s core assumptions, this book does not speciﬁcally address
the relevance of EC to strategy process research. For a critical review of EC, see
Goldinger et al. (2016):
In recent years, there has been rapidly growing interest in embodied cognition, a multifac-
eted theoretical proposition that (1) cognitive processes are inﬂuenced by the body, (2) cog-
nition exists in the service of action, (3) cognition is situated in the environment, and
(4) cognition may occur without internal representations. Many proponents view embodied
cognition as the next great paradigm shift for cognitive science. [. . .] We also argue that the
principles of EC are often (1) co-opted from other sources, such as evolution; (2) vague, such
that model building is not feasible; (3) trivially true, offering little new insight; and,
occasionally, (4) nonsensical. (Goldinger et al. 2016)
Advances in neuroscience generally and neurobiology in particular start laying
the foundation for developing models of sensing and sensemaking conditioned by
neurohormones (in particular dopamine and cortisol). Eagleman (2017) provides a
neurohormone-centric representation of prediction error minimization:
When there is a mismatch between your expectation [top-down model] and your reality
[bottom-up stimuli], this midbrain dopamine system broadcasts a signal that reevaluates the
price point. This signal tells the rest of the system whether things turned out better than
expected (an increased burst of dopamine) or worse (a decrease in dopamine). That predic-
tion error signal allows the rest of the brain to adjust its expectations to try to be closer to
reality next time. The dopamine acts as an error corrector. (Eagleman 2017; emphasis
by DBK)
Indeed, neurobiology (and neurohormones) at the board level cannot be
disregarded as an important variable determining whether stimuli are embraced as
threat or opportunity or are ignored altogether. Hodgkinson and Healy (2011) have
108
12
Future Research Agenda

put the signiﬁcance of emotional stimuli into corporate context: “The predominance
of the information processing view of the ﬁrm has ensured that current conceptions
of sensing capabilities are decidedly affect free [. . .] However, to the extent that
affect controls attention (Compton, 2003), the moods and emotions of managers
likely determine to a signiﬁcant degree what the ﬁrm attends to and how it responds”
(Hodgkinson and Healy 2011).
Recasting the phenomena of false inference and institutional psychosis as a
matter of impaired prediction error minimization may highlight how critically ﬁrm
performance is also a function of Upper Echelon’s embodied cognition as deter-
mined, amongst other, by psychological aspects as well as neurobiology.
The Bayesian brain makes weighted predictions, based on attachment dispositions
established in childhood [which can be thought of as self in action]. […] Minimising
prediction errors depends on a dynamic interaction (“conversation”) between top-down
models and bottom-up signals in which the inherent error in both directions is taken into
account. […] In line with attempts to move psychiatric diagnosis from purely descriptive
phenomenology to neuroscience-based constellations, FEP enthusiasts are beginning to
formulate aspects of psychiatric illness in prediction error terms. […] The psychosis
sufferers’ fMRIs showed [that] [b]ottom-up (midbrain) communication/conversation with
top-down cortical models was impaired, especially in the dopaminergic pathways which are
implicated in psychosis. (Holmes 2020)
As much as today’s fMRIs are up to measuring a leader’s ability to switch
between DMN and TPN, there is a need for future research assessing the real-time
ratio of anabolic (e.g., dopamine) over catabolic (e.g., cortisol) levels (also known as
growth factor) in the context of decision-making at times of environmental scarcity.
The higher the growth factor the more likely that scarcity is embraced as opportunity
rather than threat. This book has, maybe rather restrictively, treated prediction error
minimization as affect-free as well as ‘rational’, i.e., pre-supposing that the agent is
information-seeking. Indeed, the phenomenon of deliberate ignorance or strategic
ignorance (Hertwig and Engel 2020), possibly rational too, has not been considered
but could be a matter of embodied cognition. More speciﬁcally, the question arises
whether neurobiology can explain information-seeking vs. deliberately ignorant
behaviors, for example:
Utility-maximizing individuals may even be willing to pay to be shielded from information
(Nyborg 2011). (Hertwig and Engel 2020)
The future study of strategic cognition will inevitably have to embrace cognition
as embodied, enacted, and extended.
12.3
Artiﬁcial Intelligence
Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) will continue to be of increasing relevance to the study of
corporate governance and strategic decision-making, as is true for any aspect of
organizing. In fact, Friston’s free energy principle is powering machine learning
12.3
Artiﬁcial Intelligence
109

algorithms. Free energy minimization is a machine logic in its own right,
empowering living as well as artifactual organisms to optimally resist entropy.
Artiﬁcial intelligence is essentially a challenge of prediction processing:
Prediction is the process of ﬁlling in missing information. Prediction takes information you
have, often called ‘data’, and uses it to generate information you don’t have. Much
discussion about AI emphasizes the variety of prediction techniques. [. . .]: classiﬁcation,
clustering, regression, decision trees, Bayesian estimation, neural networks, topological data
analysis, deep learning, reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning, capsule net-
works, and so on. (Agrawal et al. 2018)
But above all, it is a matter of active inference (Ai), in pursuit of surprise
minimization:
The ﬁrst time I asked Friston about the connection between the free energy principle and
artiﬁcial intelligence, he predicted that within ﬁve to 10 years, most machine learning would
incorporate free energy minimization. The second time, his response was droll. ‘Think about
why it’s called active inference’, he said. [. . .]. ‘Well, it’s AI’, Friston said. So is active
inference the new AI? ‘Yes, it’s the acronym.’ (Raviv 2018)
It will be only a matter of time for machine learning-based tools to assist leader-
ship’s sensemaking of data through (en)active inference (Ai), beyond traditional
human sensemaking capabilities. However, as the cost of prediction is lowered, the
value of human judgment increases, and, consequently, human qualities are revalued
in relation to machine power: “Humans have three types of data that machines don’t.
First, human senses are powerful [. . .] Second, humans are the ultimate arbiters of
our own preferences [. . .] Third, privacy concerns restrict the data available to
machines” (Agrawal et al. 2018). Indeed, the “development of nonlinear thinking
will become more critical as artiﬁcial intelligence becomes more advanced” (Hitt
2000).
Fast-forward 3–5 years from the date of this book and it will be rather difﬁcult to
conceive
deﬁning
companies
as
inference
machines
without
giving
due
consideration to the strategy application of AI-based (and most likely Ai-powered)
algorithms. Machines will assume an increasingly important role in strategic
decision-making, and, consequently, the role, value, and developmental path of
human cognition will and must consequently co-evolve. In this regard, Mo Gawdat
(2021), former Chief Business Ofﬁcer of Google [X], provides a thought-provoking
‘singularity’ perspective on AI:
[By 2029], machine intelligence will break out of speciﬁc tasks and onto general intelli-
gence. By then, there will be machines that are smarter than humans [. . .] [By 2049], AI is
predicted to be a billion times smarter (in everything) than the smartest human. To put this
into perspective, your intelligence, in comparison to that of the machine, will be comparable
to the intelligence of a ﬂy in comparison to Einstein. We call that moment singularity.
Singularity is the moment beyond which we can no longer see, we can no longer forecast. It
is the moment beyond which we cannot predict how AI will behave because our current
perception and trajectories will no longer apply. Now the question becomes: how do you
convince this super-being that there is actually no point squashing a ﬂy?
Effectively, the challenge is moving from coding to ethics to survival. First-order
principles—such as Ai’s free energy minimization—will lay the foundation for
110

governance models to increasingly self-organize. Hilb (2020) made a valuable
contribution to ‘the role of artiﬁcial intelligence in shaping the future of corporate
governance’. In particular, Hilb’s reference to ‘autopoietic intelligence making
corporate governance self-evolve’ deserves to be further explored.
The direction
is clear: organizations
will
eventually
have
to
embrace
unsupervised learning mechanisms to master discontinuous (AI-powered) environ-
ments. It is very likely that ﬁrms will turn to Ai-driven generative models. The Free
Energy Governance framework should inspire future research for AI-powered stra-
tegic renewal. More speciﬁcally, FEG introduces the language that optimizes the
human-machine communication interface.
12.4
Board Capabilities’ Developmental Paths
In strategy research and beyond, the literature on capabilities’ developmental paths is
rich. Relevant contributions for this book are (1) Helfat (2000) addressing the “broad
question of exactly how it is that ﬁrm capabilities emerge, develop, and change over
long time spans”; (2) Gavetti (2005) linking hierarchy, cognition, and capabilities
development; (3) Hodgkinson and Healy (2011) “[demonstrating] how the funda-
mental capabilities of sensing, seizing, and transforming each require ﬁrms to
harness the cognitive and emotional capacities of individuals and groups to blend
effortful forms of analysis with the skilled utilization of less deliberative, intuitive
processes”; and (4) Laamanen and Wallin (2009) putting cognition at the heart of
capability development but, more importantly, addressing the board dynamics that
are critical to ﬁrm-level capabilities’ developmental paths:
Recognizing that transforming a ﬁrm’s capability constellation is a decision that requires
high levels of board involvement, [. . .] What emerged from this supplementary analysis was
a striking realization that the ﬁrms’ choices bore a remarkable resemblance to the proﬁles of
their board members. (Laamanen and Wallin 2009)
Indeed, the board is ultimately responsible for anticipating the ﬁrm’s future
‘capability constellation’ (including that of the board itself) to sustainably succeed
with continuous strategic renewal. However, to avoid the cognitive traps related to
individual board proﬁles that Laamanen and Wallin (2009) identiﬁed, we must study
the cognitive microfoundations of capability development at the board level. To
date, this area represents a void in both strategy and governance research:
In my personal capacity as CEO and board director, I have always believed that ﬁrm survival
is a matter of anticipating capability gaps well in advance, constantly questioning whether
the ﬁrm’s ability to develop operational capabilities from within or without is well ahead of
its future growth aspirations.
To govern and succeed in discontinuous market environments, being a board
member is not just about monitoring ﬁnancial performance, managing conﬂicts of
interest, and sharing wisdom, expertise, and networks. But above all, it must be
embraced as a new commitment to capabilities development as well as learning and
12.4
Board Capabilities’ Developmental Paths
111

unlearning, i.e., purpose-directed ﬁrm-level prediction error minimization. A ﬁrm’s
state of becoming—fueled by continuous strategic renewal—is also a function of the
board collectively embracing developmental paths of meta-capabilities such as the
ability to real-time and purposefully balance dualities: exploitation and exploration
as well as ﬁnancial and strategic control.
So, where do we turn to in our quest to develop duality management capabilities
at the board level? In fact, it requires a new ‘anti-realist’ mindset. Lanza et al.’s
(2020) eleventh principle captures the essence: “Observers ultimately deﬁne the
structure of physical reality – of states of matter and spacetime – even if there is a
‘real world out there’ beyond us, whether one of ﬁelds, quantum foam, or some other
entity.” Observers are actors. Acting is observing and observing is acting.
Once we embrace the world as actor independently nonexistent, we set free the
developmental path that lays the foundation for seeing dualities where others
continue seeing impossibilities: How can you throw yourself off a cliff and assemble
the plane on the way down? The answer pre-supposes an anti-realist mindset beyond
any pre-conceived cause-effect determinism. “Thus the ‘real world’ would prove to
be the ultimate illusion” (Halpern 2020). The business world is now starting to
embrace the metaverse, a concept that has already inspired the gaming industry for
decades. Facebook’s rebranding to Meta is beyond an aspiration. The future belongs
to virtual abundance, dissipating preconceived boundaries of mind and matter.
It is this ability ‘to throw yourself off the cliff’ that is the essence of entrepre-
neurship. Every great company can trace its very origins to that ‘cliff’. But in the
absence of board members being capable of observing the observer and leading a
meta-conversation that is geared toward reconﬁguring assets on the ﬂy by way
of vacillating exploitation/exploration and ﬁnancial/strategic control, the ﬁrm
may never succeed in assembling/re-designing the plane during ﬂight mode.
DMN-centric duality management as a dynamic board capability should be learned
and adopted as a Habit of Mind:
At the age of 29, I found myself as a board director of the then world’s leading Public-Key-
Infrastructure (PKI) supplier, Baltimore Technologies plc, encrypting ﬁnancial institutions’
most valuable transactions as well as governments’ most sensitive communications. In early
2000, the company’s valuation had ‘blitz-scaled’ into the FTSE-100 - indexing the London
Stock Exchange’s largest companies in terms of market capitalization– growing from
GBP50m to GBP8.5bn in less than two years. At the time, this was astronomical. There
was no capability constellation at the ﬁrm level that could have prepared anyone for such
exponential rise, no matter how much experience and wisdom individual members had
accumulated in prior careers – which, obviously, I had not.
But the sheer fact that Baltimore’s public market valuation was in no relation to its
business substance led me to question early on whether and how that gap could be eventually
reconciled without a mighty fall. A few months after Baltimore’s adoption into the FTSE-
100 index, I shared my concerns with the board in my resignation letter. Eighteen months
later, I returned as CEO to restructure a globally expanded business that lost its ability to
independently survive. The company was caught in the ‘ﬁnancial control trap’. Eventually,
there was no other choice but to restructure to exit. A very experienced board of directors had
utterly failed. (Khezri 2002)
112

Future Research Agenda

When, in retrospect, I reﬂect upon the Baltimore experience, I ask myself: ‘what
capabilities are required at the level of the individual board member when the
necessary ﬁrm capabilities are not yet developed?’ To answer the question, I cannot
resist but turn to the principles that Scharmer (2018) developed as part of Theory U,
in particular:
Principle 9: Practice Deep Listening and Dialogue: Connect with Your Mind and Heart
Wide Open: “When connecting to other people and contexts, open up all four ‘channels’ of
listening: Listen from what you know, from what surprises you, from the whole, and from
what you sense wants to emerge (the emerging whole).”
Principle 10—Collective Sense Making: Use Social Presencing Theater and Embod-
ied Knowing: “Whatever process you use to make sense of the learning journey, what
matters most is that you pay disciplined attention to all the voices and manifestations of the
ﬁeld [. . .] Paying disciplined attention means that you are intentionally holding back all
inclinations to mix your own interpretations or solutions. You suspend all that because you
want the data of the ‘ﬁeld’ to speak to you. But the data of the ﬁeld cannot speak to you if
your mind is too busy expressing opinions and proposing solutions.”
Principle 22—Create Enabling Infrastructures That Allow the System to Sense and
See Itself: “[. . .] ‘making the system sense and see itself’ can change the coordination
dynamics among the players in a ﬁeld, moving them toward eco-system awareness.”
As traditional governance models are increasingly uprooted in a discontinuous
world, there is not only a need for a new governance logic but correspondingly new
board capabilities’ developmental paths. Speciﬁcally, duality management as a
dynamic board capability demands dedicated research.
12.5
Conclusion
The ﬁrm is conceived as an enactive, sophisticated, and resource-dependent infer-
ence machine, linking in form of a generative model in circular causality four states:
(1) action, (2) perception, (3) ﬁrm resources, and (4) unknown/hidden events. It is an
action-generated belief system, expressed in probabilities about the beliefs a ﬁrm
holds about its beliefs’ consequences. There is only one path: the path of ‘least
action’. It is the path that satisﬁes a simple ﬁrst-order principle: free energy mini-
mization. Of course, that path presupposes that the ﬁrm has a purpose of why it
should survive in the ﬁrst place—equivalent to living organisms’ purpose to repro-
duce. It is this purpose that energizes its members and partners and determines the
ﬁrm’s context-speciﬁc goals. But the actions are always uncompromisingly deter-
mined by free-energy minimization, fostering self-organization in pursuit of surprise
minimization, i.e., survival.
Survival implies non-dissipative boundaries. A drop of ink in water dissipates.
The ﬁrm’s boundaries, however, must be nonetheless soft and not hard. In fact, the
ﬁrm’s boundaries must be increasingly ﬂexible allowing for an optimal action-
generated throughput of resource markets-originated stimuli. The softer the bound-
aries facilitating dissonant throughput, the higher the importance of simultaneously
protecting the system’s integrity, i.e., its nonequilibrium steady state (NESS).
12.5
Conclusion
113

However, top-down-only directed and centralized power structures and strategy
processes will be increasingly overwhelmed to master the challenge.
Free Energy Governance (FEG) as a framework provides the fundamental build-
ing blocks that empower a ﬁrm to implement free energy minimization as a self-
organizing principle: (1) structure (top-down/bottom-up connectivity), (2) cognition
(environmental enactment), and (3) capabilities (duality management at the board
level). Language and communication, embodied cognition, artiﬁcial intelligence,
and board capabilities’ developmental paths are just examples of the many critical
dimensions that will optimize free energy minimization in the context of strategic
renewal. Many vibrant topics in strategy management can be re-formulated as a
free-energy minimizing challenge, optimizing surprise-minimization by way of
prediction-error-minimization.

Chapter 13
Outperformance and Survival as a Matter
of Self-Organization
Abstract The classical cause-effect determinism upon which the paradigm of
strategy management as well as corporate governance research has been built is
uprooted. Popperian academics’ relentless pursuit of empirically establishing, qual-
ifying, and then falsifying mechanistic cause-effect relationships is struggling to
inspire the business community, which itself is wriggling too often with the (self-
inﬂicted) limitations of its very world models. Together—academia and practice—are
challenged to reconnect organizing to that self-evidencing dimension of the universe’s
information system. FEG is as valid for business organizations as it is for political
constructs or, for that matter, navigating geopolitical dislocations and debt cycle
disruptions. Any organism that suffers from (1) top-down/bottom-up hierarchical
dysconnectivity and a top-down dominance of supervised content prescriptions,
(2) an urge to adapt to the outer world amid an incapacity for enactive inference,
and (3) the non-existence of both a timeless (deep) purpose as well as meta-
capabilities, is naturally entropy-bound. In the absence of a generative (Bayesian)
model, we become incapacitated. Indeed, ‘camping on seesaws’ is the categorical
imperative of survival-pursuing self-organization: organization as a means, not an
end. It is right here where the fundamental difference between Traditional (TCG) and
Free Energy governance models lies. FEG sees through formal organization as
organizing manifests itself as a self-organizing generative model ‘operating as a
whole’—within and without the ﬁrm—embracing self-organization as a self-
evidencing (universal) information system.
[T]he universe is an information system that is in fact nothing more or less than the
spatiotemporal logic of the observer, meaning the self. This alone explains why the laws
and forces of nature – which could have almost any value – are all exquisitely balanced in
favor of our existence. It is why, for instance, the value of the strong nuclear force is within the
narrow range that allows the atomic nuclei in our bodies to hold together without disastrously
binding protons together as well. It explains why the gravitational force is exactly as it must be
for the sun to ignite, and for fusion to proceed, generating the forces needed to make the carbon
atoms that are the very backbone of life itself. (Lanza et al., 2020; emphasis by DBK)

continuous and wholesale nature (Siebel 2019). Entrenched models of organizing
and governance, however, only sub-optimally exercise ﬁrms’ sensing and
sensemaking capabilities. The classical cause-effect determinism upon which the
paradigm of strategy management as well as corporate governance research has been
built is uprooted. Indeed, “the processes which produce crises are substantially
identical to the processes which produce successes” (Starbuck and Milliken 1988).
Popperian academics’ relentless pursuit of empirically establishing, qualifying,
and then falsifying deterministic cause-effect relationships is struggling to inspire the
business community, which itself is too often wriggling with the (self-inﬂicted)
limitations of their very world models.
The only thing that can be falsiﬁed is a null ‘hypothesis’. In other words, the only way you
can falsify something is to reject the null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis.
The notion of falsiﬁability is thus a very weak notion. It is weak on several fronts. First, and
my favorite, is that the hypothesis that ‘a hypothesis is falsiﬁable’ is itself not falsiﬁable. This
usually keeps people quite when they ask me whether the free energy principle is falsiﬁable.
On a more serious note, falsiﬁable hypotheses are a hangover from classical inference.
(Friston et al. 2018; emphasis by DBK).
Together, academia and practice are challenged to reconnect organizing to that
self-evidencing dimension inherent of the universe’s information system to “pur-
posefully create, extend, or modify [the ﬁrm’s] resource base” (Helfat et al. 2007)—
to thrive and survive.
Purposeful behaviour is one of life’s deﬁning features, but it is only possible if living
systems operate as a whole. [. . .] It is only by managing information that the cell can impose
order on the extreme complexity of its operations and therefore fulﬁl its ultimate purpose of
staying alive and reproducing. (Nurse 2020)
Free Energy Governance (FEG) proposes a framework that integrates the critical
building blocks (structure, cognition, and capabilities) empowering a purpose-
directed, self-organizing, and surprise-minimizing ﬁrm as a generative model
governed by one simple ﬁrst-order principle: free-energy minimization. Effective
self-organization is a function of ﬁrst-order principles dedicated to optimizing
resistance to dissipation. Free energy, as an information-theoretic rather than ther-
modynamic measure, is uniquely positioned to measure and guide a ﬁrm’s surviv-
ability as a self-organizing information as well as belief system:
[Friston] recalls a thought he had as a teenager: ‘There must be a way of understanding
everything by starting from nothing [. . .] If I’m only allowed to start off with one point in the
entire universe, can I derive everything else I need from that?’ In Friston’s world, the free
energy principle is now the nearly nothing that can explain almost everything. (Lindsay,
2021; emphasis by DBK)
Exploitation and exploration encapsulate the everything of a ﬁrm’s self-
evidencing actions. The relevance of corporate (exploitation) budgets and the suc-
cess of exploration, respectively, are a function of the (self)-organizing process that
generates the underlying assumptions concerning states that we either do not know
or are not in control of. In fact, planning and exploration are a matter of enactive,
sophisticated, and resource-dependent inference. Indeed, “learn to plan and plan to
learn” (Friston et al. 2021) is learning to infer. We need mechanisms of organizing
118

and governance that account ex ante for error, uncertainty, and ambiguity. In
summary, the inferential discovery of informational dissonance as an error-
minimizing source for optimizing the accuracy of posterior beliefs rather than
‘explaining dissonance away’ (Shepherd et al. 2017) is essential to ﬁrm survival in
discontinuous environments.
I have been immensely privileged to complete a PhD in strategy management at the age of
51, while simultaneously transforming an international and diversiﬁed media company,
Marquard Media Group (MMG). The company has been embarking on a wholesale rein-
vention from an advertisement-centric to a transaction-led business model, from lifestyle and
IT publishing to e-commerce, IT educational services, and gamiﬁcation software develop-
ment (see Khezri and Schuster 2021). As MMG’s Group-CEO and part-owner, it has been
fascinating to build the bridge between theory and practice in real-time. So, how does Free-
Energy Governance work when it comes to (self-evidencing) exploitation and exploration?
FEG emerges in language and communication. To express an exploration challenge, for
example, as a matter of enactive inference is instantly giving structure to the project’s
execution path. More speciﬁcally, exploration is the dynamic interplay of purpose, action,
perception, ﬁrm resources, and the unknown revealed through hypothesis testing, i.e.,
prediction-error minimization. Even to the least mathematically inclined manager, it is
intuitive to start thinking about exploration as an algorithmic equation dynamically linking
knowns and unknowns as well as what is within and beyond the ﬁrm’s control. More
importantly, exploration is action-centric in form of epistemic foraging and hypothesis-
testing generating bottom-up stimuli and data-input to continuously update prior beliefs to
optimize posterior precision.
Even if we stick to a ‘word model’ instead of mathematical formulations, enactive
inference’s essential building blocks—six altogether—dynamically map exploration’s con-
ditional (in)dependencies: (1) four states: active (action), sensory (perception), internal
(ﬁrm resources), and external (hidden unknowns); (2) one internal-external Markovian
boundary: the site where our actions upon hidden states generate outcomes that feed in
circular causality our perception and allow the precision-enhancing updating of prior beliefs
(predictions); and ﬁnally, (3) one ﬁrst-order principle: free-energy-minimization as a
measure of minimizing equivocality, error, and uncertainty, i.e., the divergence between
predictions (prior beliefs) and outcomes (posterior beliefs). Eventually, everything becomes
measurable.
Once managers start approaching exploration in form of enactive inference linking in
circular causality all four states conditioned by the Markov blanket and governed by free-
energy minimization, we can straightaway see that success in exploration is critically
determined by the level of sophistication of: (1) prediction models (a self-evidencing
eco-niche model that connects corporate purpose with the very predictions the ﬁrm stipu-
lates), (2) the bounded set of external states that the ﬁrm decides to act upon to bottom-up
sample the world and test hypotheses with the least required computational (resource)
investment, and (3) belief-updating resulting from the consequences (posterior beliefs)
that the ﬁrm’s actions generate. It is now self-evident to appreciate that action is central to
perception. More importantly, the ﬁrm’s generative model and actions ‘control’ ambiguity
and uncertainty. The ﬁrm’s generative model is the ﬁrm’s eco-niche. The ﬁrm is more in
control than it traditionally resists to believe. The perception of ‘uncertainty’ is actor/
observer-, i.e., ﬁrm-speciﬁc.
As I am ﬁnalizing this book, Marquard Media Group is in the process of completing the
Group’s 2022 budgets. While certain ﬁnancial ratios guide the CEO’s top-down evaluation
of the bottom-up generated budgets, however, the budget’s essential part are less the
numbers but the level of sophistication and precision of the underlying assumptions
supporting the numbers. More speciﬁcally, when managers start articulating assumptions
(world models and related hypotheses) in form of dynamically linking corporate purpose,
predictions (beliefs) and planned actions to minimize error and surprise, the bottom-up seeds
for Free-Energy Governance are planted. In my role as CEO, board member and, not least,
13

119

part-owner, I am uniquely positioned to introduce FEG’s language as a basis to bottom-up
cultivate enactive inference in pursuit of neg-entropy (i.e., non-equilibrium steady states—
the state of survival). But the journey for changing the language as well as the ﬁrm’s logic of
organizing must start with the board of directors, top-down, purveying FEG’s core building
blocks around structure, cognition, and capabilities as a matter of self-evidencing self-
organization in pursuit of ﬁrm survival.
If you ask board members at the start of a board meeting, for example, to
summarize in no more than 3 min on a piece of paper the ﬁrm’s timeless purpose
(not vision or mission) but answer the question ‘why this business should exist in the
ﬁrst place?’, you will be surprised to learn that there may be as many purposes as
board members or just a blank space. Everything in business ﬂows from the clarity and
self-evidence of the ﬁrm’s timeless purpose. The organism’s timeless purpose, beyond
resisting dissipation to survive and reproduce, lays the foundation for self-organization
and, hence, Free Energy Governance.
Upper Echelon will need to cease the ill-fated pursuit of top-down dominating
strategy content. The ﬁrm’s intelligence is at the bottom of the organization, close to
resource markets (clients, suppliers, partners, and technologies) where the exponen-
tial dynamics of transformation-bearing signals are staged. Indeed, we must ask:
does ‘strategy’ as a top-down ‘plan of action’ still has meaning in a fast-paced,
distributed, and discontinuous world?
Rationality seems better understood as a postdecision rather than a predecision occurrence.
Rationality makes sense of what has been, not of what will be. It is a process of justiﬁcation
in which past deeds are made to appear sensible to the actor himself [herself] and to those
other persons to whom he [she] feels accountable. (Weick 1969)
Indeed, business leaders retrospectively make sense of what has happened and
then label it ‘strategy’. Listening to the practitioners who expressed their views as
part of this book’s underlying dissertational research, it is evident that purpose,
principles, and clearly deﬁned long-term target (prediction) models are essential.
Long-term strategic plans, however, are not only being marginalized but could be a
source of inertia.
As much as human judgment is revalued in a machine learning and data-driven
environment, purpose rather than strategy is what really matters (Bartlett and Goshal
1994; Gulati 2022). But purpose must be continuously enacted in the very context of
time and space. The most successful companies do not change their purpose, even
when they change their corporate brand (e.g., Google to Alphabet, Facebook to
Meta). They merely re-interpret purpose according to its spatiotemporal context.
Gulati (2022) has introduced the concept of Deep Purpose, which reinforces the
existential nature of corporate purpose to ﬁrm outperformance and survival:
In deﬁning purpose, deep purpose leaders look to the past, immersing themselves in the
intentions of founders and early employees, scouring for themes that capture the ﬁrm’s
ineffable soul or essence. This attention to history lends purpose an extra weightiness,
resulting in deeper emotional connections and more commitment to the reason for being.
Paradoxically, it also serves as a bridge to the future, helping leaders to chart a path ahead
that is meaningful, coherent, and grounded.

Outperformance and Survival as a Matter of Self-Organization

Purpose lays the foundation for the very data we seek to enact to feed the ﬁrm’s
generative model, empowering self-organization. To borrow from Seneca’s famous
quote, purpose is not so much about knowing which port you are sailing to. But ‘why
are you sailing in the ﬁrst place?’ is the question that every company must answer to
continuously enact its very eco-niche to thrive and survive. Jan Ståhlberg’s (2021)
reﬂections upon the foundation and success of EQT, one of the world’s leading PE
investors, put into perspective how ﬁrm performance and the eco-niche’s common
good are interdependently and causally linked as duality:
Yes, EQT has been an incredible success story. The original team was in a range of
26–34 years old when the ﬁrm started in the mid-1990s, supported by the Wallenberg
family. The success of the Wallenberg family, which at the time was in its ﬁfth generation
and controlled a third of Sweden’s stock market, comes really down to a long-term approach
powered by a circular reasoning: what is good for society is good for the country, and this
will be good for our companies and eventually our family. Society was always a central
focus of all business decisions. In my view, EQT’s success cannot be separated from that
background story. [. . .] You must invest into structures, into a future that serves well beyond
your typical 5-year PE investment horizon. Our competitive advantage in the PE industry
was to develop an operations-focused industrial approach. Obviously, many large compa-
nies laughed at us because for them PE and long-term is a contradiction in itself.
In summary, ﬁrm outperformance and survival are essentially a matter of com-
bining (1) a timeless (deep, Gulati 2022) purpose, (2) generative top-down/bottom-
up prediction error minimization in form of free energy minimizing enactive infer-
ence, and (3) principled values and aspirations determining eco-niche prosperity and
sustainability. If all three elements are articulated in simple (“explainable”) language
and communicated to all members, within and beyond the ﬁrm’s boundaries, then
the ﬁrm’s long-term prospects will be substantially enhanced in form of a self-
organizing generative model. The board of directors rather than executive leadership
only must ensure that those elements come to life—and, more importantly, stay
alive.
Firm survival is essentially determined by ‘learning from the future as it
emerges’. This is the essence of enactive Ai as a basis for self-organization:
We have the gift to engage with two very different qualities and streams of time. One of them
is a quality of the present moment that is basically an extension of the past. The present
moment is shaped by what has been. The second is a quality of the present moment that
functions as a gateway to a ﬁeld of future possibilities. The present moment is shaped by
what is wanting to emerge. That quality of time, if connected to, operates from presencing
the highest future potential. The word presencing blends ‘sensing’ with ‘presence’. It means
to sense and actualize one’s highest future potential. Whenever we deal with disruption, it is
the second stream of time that matters most. Because without that connection we tend to end
up as victims rather than co-shapers of disruption. (Scharmer, 2018)
In a discontinuous and distributed world, “perhaps all social institutions [. . .] face
disruptive forces so fast, big, and unpredictable that every entity will fall within
years or decades, without exception. Can we still stave off decline in the face of
severe turbulence?” (Collins 2009; emphasis by DBK). ‘What are the origins of
competitive advantage?’ is strategy research’s most fundamental question:
13
Outperformance and Survival as a Matter of Self-Organization
121

Ex post, it is clear that some ﬁrms actively identify, interpret, and act upon early signals from
their internal and external environment, and so position themselves to effectively exploit
these opportunities well in advance of others’ demonstration of the pay-off from the
strategies which emerge later on as ‘best practice’. These ﬁrms are creating new sources
of competitive advantage. Understanding how they organize ex ante to do this is, in our
view, a central question for strategy research. (Cockburn et al. 2000)
Free Energy Governance is not about optimizing a ﬁrm’s ‘shelf life’ for the sake
of it, but essentially answers Cockburn’s central question for strategy research: FEG
is about continuously and optimally generating ex ante new sources of competitive
advantage by way of purpose-driven free energy minimizing enactive inference,
engaging the whole organization, and beyond, i.e., the ﬁrm’s eco-systems. As
machines will assume an increasingly prominent role in strategic decision-making,
Upper Echelon is challenged to effectively enact the human-machine interface to
fully leverage the ﬁrm’s multi-intelligence dimension. Language and communica-
tion are the site of emergence for that interface. Ai provides the language and logic to
fully leverage AI as a foundation for competitive advantage in a discontinuous and
distributed environment.
FEG is as valid for business organizations as it is for political constructs or, for
that matter, navigating geopolitical dislocations and debt cycle disruptions. Any
organism that suffers from a (1) top-down/bottom-up dysconnectivity, (2) top-down
dominance of ideological and supervised content prescriptions, (3) dominant logic to
adapt to ‘the outer world’ amid a self-inﬂicted incapacity for enactive inference, and
not least (4) non-existence of a timeless purpose as well as meta-capabilities, such as
listening to what wants to emerge in the web of random interactions and observing
the observer, is naturally entropy-bound and incapacitated to navigate macro-
disruptions.
Therefore, national democracies such as Switzerland, for example, are likely to
get sustainably stronger and more prosperous over time: (1) strong top-down/
bottom-up connectivity in form of direct democracy fostering dialogue and cultivat-
ing an ‘explainable’ public discourse across the political hierarchy from the federal
level to the cantonal to the local community level; (2) a timeless purpose in form of
protecting its autonomy, self-sufﬁciency, and sustainability as a small, land-bound,
and overall unique country anchored in the Calvinist humbleness to never take its
national wealth for granted but to proactively, collectively, and equitably advance
the country’s collective prosperity; and (3) a ﬁrst-order (self-organizing) principle in
form of respect for and belief in the individual’s autonomy and capability for self-
discipline and sound judgement as a foundation to foster the country’s freedom,
prosperity, and autonomy. All three dimensions are cross-fertilizing in circular
causality. Each element is foundational. The Habit of Mind (Wurtzel 2012) that
best captures Switzerland’s DNA: “Be Humble, Run Scared.”1
1I am grateful to my dear Swiss friends—Frank Bodin, Jürg Marquard, Luka and Thomas Müller,
Marcel Peter, Christoph Tonini, and Marc Walder—for the enriching conversations allowing me to
understand from within Switzerland as a uniquely ‘self-organizing construct’. Each one of you—in
very distinct ways—represents the uniqueness of Swissness. At the time of ﬁnalizing this book
122

Outperformance and Survival as a Matter of Self-Organization

Switzerland is as close as a national democracy can sustainably self-organize and,
consequently, outperform. A supranational construct such as the European Union
(EU), for example, is structurally top-down/bottom-up disconnected. Hence, the
foundation for a generative self-organizing model is non-existent. In addition, the
EU is struggling to unite its peoples around a timeless and energizing purpose: peace
and economic integration are no longer sufﬁciently invigorating (though, Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine may change this). The EU is left with nothing more but
advancing its very self as a self-serving purpose, justifying ever more expansion
and supranational integration. But to what end? Simply put, the self has become the
EU’s ﬁrst-order principle: rather than serving as a means, it has become an end.
Entropic forces are inevitably on the rise, advancing dissipation from within its
member states (Khezri 2005). The EU is the antithesis to entropy-defying self-
organization. It “is trapped in a self-feeding vicious circle” (Khezri 2009).
Michael Hitt’s endorsement of this book invited me to revisit the works of Nobel
laureate Douglass North, which had not only inspired my studies of economics but
do beﬁt the very context of applying FEG to the study of the rise and decline of
nations:
Humans attempt to use their perceptions about the world to structure their environment in
order to reduce uncertainty in human interaction. But whose perceptions matter and how
they get translated into transforming the human environment are consequences of the
institutional structure, which is a combination of formal rules, informal constraints, and
their enforcement characteristics. This structure of human interaction determines who are the
entrepreneurs whose choices matter and how such choices get implemented by the decision
rules of that structure. Institutional constraints cumulate through time, and the culture of a
society is the cumulative structure of rules and norms (and beliefs) that we inherit from the
past that shape our present and inﬂuence our future. […] Does the uncertainty that humans
face come from the inherent instability of the human landscape or from the perceptions
and belief systems that we have about the human environment? (North 2005; emphasis
by DBK)
“Sometime before the year 2025, America will pass through a great gate in
history, commensurate with the American Revolution, Civil War, and the twin
emergencies of the Great Depression and World War II” (Strauss and Howe
1997). The study of more than 500 years of modern history has quite consistently
manuscript, an upcoming direct democracy-initiated vote on COVID-related regulations is dividing
Swiss society in unprecedented ways. I have all the conﬁdence that the generative and open
discourse integral to self-organizing generative models (i.e., direct democracy)—no matter how
divisive the debate—will continue strengthening the organism’s resilience. This was equally true
for the 1992 vote when Swiss people rejected closer European integration. In contrast, other
democracies’ top-down blitz enforcements of COVID-related restrictions (often grossly intruding
on fundamental freedoms, thus, bordering upon constitutional unlawfulness) are equally dividing
society. But in the void of self-organizing generative mechanisms, societal psychopathology is
cultivated and will further disenfranchise and fragment the very foundation of democracy and
society, potentially leading to entropic dissipation. In a world that is less classical but more
quantum, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century constructs of governance—such as the nation-state
as well as democracy—are no less in need to be fundamentally challenged and reinterpreted. In the
absence of self-organizing mechanisms, entropy is rising, and revolt is, eventually, looming.

distilled 100-year cycles (the saeculum) each consisting of four turnings: growth
(spring), maturation (summer), entropy (fall), and destruction (winter). “The farther
backward you look, the farther forward you are likely to see” (Winston Churchill, as
quoted in Strauss and Howe 1997). This temporal thickness (Friston 2017),
unconstrained from today’s dominant and erroneous interpretation of time as a
phenomenon of linear progress, powers sophisticated (generative) self-organizing
(ﬁrst-order principle governed) prediction models. “Finally, unlearn the linear view
that positive change always comes willingly, incrementally, and by human design
[. . .] our faith in linear progress has often amounted to a Faustian bargain with our
children. Faust always ups the ante, and every bet is double or nothing. Through
much of the Third Turning, we have managed to postpone the reckoning. But history
warns that we can’t defer it beyond the next bend in time” (Strauss and Howe 1997).
We cannot change the universe’s seasonality, but we can prepare for it. This is
precisely where free-energy minimization as a ﬁrst-order principle and, more spe-
ciﬁcally, Free-Energy Governance will make the difference: deﬁne a timeless (deep/
existential) purpose as the axiomatic foundation for a generative top-down/bottom-
up prediction-error-minimization model, go out and explore so that epistemic and
pragmatic actions can deliver the stimuli (data points) to update and enhance—in
circular causality—the precision of posterior beliefs. Thus, the crisis-winter will be
more likely enacted as opportunity rather than threat. “Be Humble and Run Scared”
(Wurtzel 2012) as free-energy minimizing self-organization blends with the uni-
verse’s information system. “Each circle of time has a great moment of discontinu-
ity” (Strauss and Howe 1997): reality (learning) models, underlying principles, and
corresponding actions determine how successfully the very present moment is
leveraged “as a gateway to a ﬁeld of future possibilities” (Scharmer 2018) and
whether one emerges as co-shaper rather than victim of discontinuity.
Ray Dalio’s (2021) study of world history, from China’s Tang dynasty in 600 CE
to the present time, brilliantly crystalizes the rise and fall of nations as a function of
credit and reserve-currency cycles. Accordingly, we are now in the saeculum’s
Fourth Turning that Strauss and Howe (1997) foretold 25 years ago. Indeed, there
are many timeless cause-effect relationships that the study of history beholds in form
of salient determinants (hyper-priors) suggesting what to predict next. While
throughout history such cause-effect relationships may have ex-post consistently
elucidated disruption and, indeed, should serve as an alert gauge for impending
discontinuity, circumstances are always rather unique. More speciﬁcally, classical
cause-effect relationships at the macro (cosmic) level get disrupted at the quantum
(subatomic) level. Technological advancement and inventiveness, the accelerating
nature of disintermediation at every level of economic activity as well as geopolitical
balance-of-power shifts and (de-)globalization, for example, make the timing and
shape of credit and business cycles less and less predictable. Nature’s very rhythm—
the universe’s information system—is inescapable, as much as modern technologies
are “[ﬂattening] the very physical evidence of natural cycles” (Strauss and Howe
1997). But to survive, above all, the collective—“the body itself” (Allen and Friston
2018)—must be united around a timeless purpose, “operate as a whole” (Nurse
2020), and exercise self-discipline in its pursuit—at both the individual as well as
124
13

collective level. Fragmentation within the collective, lack of purpose, and absence of
self-discipline are likely to foster skilled incompetence: actions become counterpro-
ductive, decadence spreads, and entropic dissipation accelerates. Navigating and
preparing for the seasonal disruption of credit cycles are no less a matter of
governing continuous transformation. Fundamentally, it is a generative free-energy
minimization, i.e., Free-Energy Governance, challenge.
‘Reality’ is a matter of emergence in interactions and relations. We are living in a
multi-world—every action confronts us with new forks of inﬁnite possibilities for
actions leading to distinct paths. The more timeless our purpose and the more
bottom-up challenged our top-down predictions and underlying models are, the
less vulnerable we are in the face of discontinuities. Adaptation is an ill-suited
catch-up tool in discontinuous and distributed market environments. To navigate
discontinuity, we must learn to purpose-directedly, generatively, and en-actively
infer our very world.
In the absence of a generative (Bayesian) model, we become incapacitated.
Indeed, when throwing yourself off the cliff to assemble the plane in free-fall,
‘camping on seesaws’ (Hedberg et al. 1976) is the categorical imperative of
survival-pursuing self-organization: organization as a means, not an end. It is
right here where the fundamental difference between Traditional (TCG) and Free
Energy Governance lies. FEG sees through formal organization as organizing
manifests itself as a self-organizing generative model operating within and without
the ﬁrm, dedicated to a timeless purpose.
To appreciate self-organization as a self-evidencing information system, at any
logical level—subatomic, cellular, human, ﬁrm, or cosmic—Alan Lightman’s
(2021) ‘probable impossibilities’ provide a fascinating perspective on human exis-
tence between two inﬁnities: the ultratiny (Planck’s quantum length of 1033
centimeters, i.e., “a hundred million billion times smaller than a quark [. . .] the
same ratio as the nucleus is smaller than the state of Rhode Island” where “time and
space no longer exist in a way that has meaning to us”), i.e., the nothing, and the
ultra-large, the universe, i.e., the everything.
How many times should the size of a human body be halved to reach the size of an atom
(a size unknown until the twentieth century)? The answer is about 33. Going in the opposite
direction, one can ask how many times the size of the human body should be doubled to
reach the size of a typical star, like our Sun [. . .] The answer is 30. Thus, counting in
doublings, the size of the human being is nearly halfway between an atom and a star [. . .]
And it is a deeply human experience – concerning what the human mind understands and
what that mind does not yet understand. The [Markovian] boundary between the known and
the unknown is not a static boundary. (Lightman 2021)
As Lanza et al. (2020) wrote, “the laws and forces of nature – which could have
almost any value – are all exquisitely balanced in favor of our existence”. This is true
for living organisms but not for man-made artifacts, such as nation-states, societies
and organizations. Indeed, the innate reﬂex is to explain dissonance away and to
avoid uncertainty, reinforcing the known, top-down suppressing self-organization,
and subsequently increasing free energy. This is precisely how credit cycles, for
example, consistently become inﬂationary and eventually blow-up with potentially
and systemically devastating consequences. More speciﬁcally, the system gets

caught in the ﬁnancial control trap (steroidal monetary policy) crowding out strate-
gic control (credit creation for productive purposes and inventiveness) as: (1) top-
down/bottom up prediction-error minimization is non-existent; (2) enactment of a
new model remains incapacitated as adaptation to the known dominates and, ﬁnally,
(3) governance capabilities de-antagonizing polarizing forces as duality are non-
developed and the absence of a Markov blanket is turning the interdependency
between internal and external orders entropic. Eventually, the system breaks down.
Free-Energy Governance is (self)-empowering thinking born of curiosity, revolt,
and change (Rovelli 2021). FEG embraces the world beyond the ﬁrm’s Bayesian
priors to listen and hear what urges to be enacted in the haziness of the distributed
and discontinuous web of exponential inter-actions that has no pre-existence or
spatio-temporal logic. More speciﬁcally, the ﬁrm’s competitiveness—in terms of
continuous strategic renewal and, hence, survival in discontinuous market environ-
ments—is determined by the temporal thickness and counterfactual depth (Friston
2017) of the ﬁrm’s top-down/bottom-up active inference capability.
We must leave the world of the known to renormalize to self-organize to
outperform to survive.
Let’s call it Friston’s Law: All the quantities in a self-organising system that can change will
change to minimise free energy. So, there you have it. Armed with this knowledge,
everything that we call mental life becomes mathematically tractable. (Solms 2021)

Engaged Scholarship Interviews
Engaged scholarship is deﬁned as a participative form of research for obtaining the different
perspectives of key stakeholders (researchers, users, clients, sponsors, and practitioners) in
studying complex problems. By involving others and leveraging their different kinds of
knowledge, engaged scholarship can produce knowledge that is more penetrating and
insightful than when scholars or practitioners work on the problems alone.

Abstract Case’s governance experience encompasses private and publicly listed
companies as well as public institutions. Five key interview statements are worth
highlighting: (1) “there is a need to take a fresh look at governance models”;
(2) “governance cannot be viewed in a vacuum – what is appropriate really depends
on the context”; hence, “a ‘one size ﬁts all’ approach will likely be ﬂawed”;
(3) “where the organization is in the lifecycle will likely lead to a sense of how
‘top down’ vs ‘bottoms up’ the governance should be”; (4) “sometimes the best way
to expand and grow is to not just rely on internal innovation, but to acquire [. . .] be
careful to not let M&A become the only source of innovation and growth, as that too
can stiﬂe innovation in other parts of the company”; (5) “Signals for transformative
changes can often start at the bottom, because younger people may be more attuned
to this. But in other instances, the leadership needs to come from the top, as people at
lower levels may be too task-speciﬁc and miss the relevant signals.”

Steve Case (January 29, 2020)
Steve Case is one of America’s best-known and most accomplished entrepreneurs and a
pioneer in making the Internet part of everyday life. Steve’s entrepreneurial career began in
1985 when he co-founded America Online (AOL). Under Steve’s leadership, AOL became
the world’s largest and most valuable Internet company. In 2014, Steve was named a
Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship. Steve is on the Board of Regents of
the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. He is CEO and Chairman of Revolution, a
venture and growth capital dedicated investment ﬁrm.
“I tend to agree with many of the propositions of the Free Energy Governance
framework. Most importantly, I believe there is a need to take a fresh look at
governance models, in light of the many challenges/opportunities of our times.
The various experiences I’ve had, ranging from starting America Online, to
chairing a merged AOL/Time Warner, to backing entrepreneurs via Revolution, or
by helping to oversee public institutions like the Smithsonian, lead me to conclude
that governance cannot be viewed in a vacuum – what is appropriate really depends
on the context in which you’re operating. A ‘one size ﬁts all’ approach will likely be
ﬂawed. Rather, you need to ﬁnetune the governance for the speciﬁc circumstance,

based on where the organization is in its life cycle, how the team is working and what
changes might be needed to position the organization for the future, how the
company or organization ﬁts in a broader context (competition, technology, govern-
ment, and other), what challenges you face and/or opportunities you’re seeking to
seize, etc. That assessment will likely lead to a sense of how ‘top down’ vs ‘bottoms
up’ the governance should be, for the next chapter.
As an entrepreneur and a backer of entrepreneurs, I tend to prefer a more
distributed ‘bottoms up’ approach. But I’ve seen situations where stronger ‘top
down’ leadership is required. An example is the leadership Bob Iger has brought
to Disney in recent years, pulling the entire company together to launch Disney+. He
(and the board) concluded that Disney needed to control its streaming future and
insisted that every division work together to ensure a successful launch of Disney+.
By contrast, the merger of AOL and Time Warner was disappointing in part because
it lacked a clear uniﬁed vision and failed to bring every division of the company
together to build on its early lead in media, communications and Internet.
In other situations, driving in innovation down in the organization, to unleash a
wave of experimentation and a culture of innovation can be transformative. Often the
innovators just need resources and a champion, and to get the friction/bureaucracy
removed, so they can launch new initiatives. In those instances, too much top-down
leadership could be stiﬂing, and slow innovation.
And sometimes the best way to expand and grow is to not just rely on internal
innovation, but to acquire compelling and compatible businesses. This leads to an
M&A-centric effort, which likely does enable the company to expand more rapidly,
but then there are integration issues to deal with. And you need to be careful to not let
M&A become the only source of innovation and growth, as that too can stiﬂe
innovation in other parts of the company.
Yes, the world is more distributed and discontinuous, and that process will be
accelerated by a whole range of new technologies. Overall, I tend to agree that
invention and innovation are getting cheaper. However, while that may be true, in
certain cases commercial scalability is still very expensive and in some cases is so
complicated as a result of regulations that innovation is there but market scalability is
impossible. This is increasingly true for healthcare, for example. Commercial scaling
is very hard, even in a low-cost innovation environment.
It is tricky to ﬁnd the right balance between top-down/bottom-up. Signals for
transformative changes can often start at the bottom, because younger people may be
more attuned to this. But in other instances, the leadership needs to come from the
top, as people at lower levels may be too task-speciﬁc and miss the relevant signals.
The key takeaway for me is leadership and governance matters. Thomas Edison
famously said, ‘vision without execution is hallucination’ and I agree with that. You
need vision to have a sense of where you want/need to go, but you can’t get there
without strong execution, which ultimately comes down to people – and how they
are led, managed and governed.”

Jan Ståhlberg
Abstract Jan Ståhlberg is one of Europe’s private equity veterans who has consis-
tently embraced governance as a critical driver of performance and value creation.
Five key interview statements are worth highlighting: (1) “private equity should
outperform public companies [. . .] PE practitioners constantly question the status
quo.” (2) “Public boards are more dedicated to what they have. They rarely question
the existing business.” (3) “Everyone is informed in real-time about everything.
Indeed, this may lead to an overload of information, but overall, this is still more
preferable than top-down ﬁltering that may risk excluding potentially insightful
stimuli and feedback [. . .] this is Free Energy Governance: connecting top and
bottom in circular causality of sensemaking with the least friction and optimal
response time.” (4) “Create a culture that empowers and encourages people to
contribute, to take decisions, and not to be risk averse.” (5) “You cannot expect
bottom-up stimuli reaching the top when the top is not reaching out to the bottom.
And sometimes a simple walk through the ofﬁce can make all the difference. Listen
humble and with respect. In summary, it really comes down to three things:
communication, transparency, and respect.”

Jan Ståhlberg (February 14, 2020)
Jan Ståhlberg is Founder of Trill Impact, a buyout ﬁrm dedicated to impact investing. Jan is a
former partner of EQT, a company he joined in 1995 as part of the initial team. During his
tenure, until mid-2018, he held positions such as Vice Chairman, Deputy Managing Partner,
and Head of Mid-Market globally across Europe, the United States, and Asia.
“From my perspective PE, and in particular EQT, for example, have always
embraced governance as a critical driver of both performance and long-term value
creation. Indeed, private equity should outperform public companies for a number of
reasons: First, PE has more strategic freedom. PE practitioners constantly question
the status quo. Public boards are more dedicated to what they have. They rarely
question the existing business. Second, PE neutralize any potential conﬂicts of
interest and build alignment of interests so that the collective power of all involved
can be optimally leveraged for a long-term goal. Third, optimal capital allocation is a

key value-driver. Public companies have more difﬁculty in convincing markets to
over-capitalize for future growth opportunities or public boards are often reluctant to
reduce capitalization to beneﬁt from more efﬁcient capital costs fearing a potential
embarrassment asking for a capital injection even in a very unlikely negative
scenario although that lower capitalization may be in the best interest of the
shareholders. Fourth, at least at EQT, a paranoia-powered sense of urgency has
always been part of the DNA.
In my personal experience, buying businesses directly from the founding entre-
preneurs can be challenging for PE. Founders are typically obsessed with their
business, in every detail. It is almost impossible to replace the Founder. Governance
is typically very effective. But once you take out the Founder and introduce more
professional structures, the organization can get paralyzed since the organization is
not used to a traditional chain of command.
Yes, EQT has been an incredible success story. The original team was in a range
of 26–34 years old when the ﬁrm started in the mid-1990s, supported by the
Wallenberg family. The success of the Wallenberg family, which at the time was
in its ﬁfth generation and controlled a third of Sweden’s stock market, comes really
down to a long-term approach powered by a circular reasoning: what is good for
society is good for the country, and this will be good for our companies and
eventually our family. Society was always a central focus of all business decisions.
In my view EQT’s success cannot be separated from that background story. I believe
EQT beneﬁted hugely from the Wallenberg network. In my opinion, for PE to create
substantial value, you must be long-term focused. You must invest into structures,
into a future that serves well beyond your typical 5-year PE investment horizon. Our
competitive advantage in the PE industry was to develop an operations-focused
industrial approach. Obviously, many large companies laughed at us because for
them PE and long-term is a contradiction in itself.
I believe those founding roots have ‘governed’ EQT to this day. It is reﬂected in
the organizational design and the ﬁrm’s long-term orientation. EQT operated on the
basis that ‘everyone should know’. Everyone is informed in real-time about every-
thing. Indeed, this may lead to an overload of information, but overall, this is still
more preferable than top-down ﬁltering that may risk excluding potentially insight-
ful stimuli and feedback.
How did we manage this: we allowed everyone in the ﬁrm to listen into the
investment calls, for example. It was a brilliant move. While other PE ﬁrms
cultivated ‘closed doors’, we embraced such openness as a major learning platform,
training young professionals to understand our sense of urgency, paranoia, long-term
focus and, not least, our principles. More importantly, we often beneﬁted from
insights we would have not accessed otherwise. Our organizational structure has
never been cascaded. And, I believe, looking at some of the core propositions of Free
energy Governance, this is Free energy Governance: connecting top and bottom in
circular causality of sensemaking with the least friction and optimal response time.
Overall, I think as long as people are open-minded, the composition of the board
is not the problem. Communication is everything. Value creation, in my experience,
134
15
Jan Ståhlberg

has been usually determined by a combination of the following governance
imperatives:
First, you must start with a clear purpose and long-term goal. Prepare to invest for
the long-term, and into structure. Second, you need to continuously question your-
self. Paranoia is key. Third, team-decisions are critical. Create a culture that
empowers and encourages people to contribute, to take decisions, and not to be
risk averse. Team-decisions are an optimal way to get the best out of everyone.
Fourth, the organization must be open and transparent; no room for politics.
When I was running the global Mid-Market operations out of New York, I was
known for ‘walking around’, cleaning tables and putting my coffee cup in the
dishwasher. You cannot expect bottom-up stimuli reaching the top when the top is
not reaching out to the bottom. And sometimes a simple walk through the ofﬁce can
make all the difference. Listen humble and with respect. In summary, it really comes
down to three things: communication, transparency, and respect.
Indeed, the world is discontinuous and increasingly distributed. Young people are
an unpredictable force for change. I believe you call it enactment as part of the Free
Energy Governance framework. You can enact your world and then things do not
look that unpredictable. With Trill Impact, I am now dedicated to a megatrend,
which I believe is about to accelerate and will fundamentally disrupt leading
corporations: in terms of sustainability, a business has either a positive or negative
footprint; a positive footprint will win hearts and minds and will eventually lower
costs of capital.”

Acknowledgments and Epilogue
Enrolling in a PhD program is kind of ‘throwing yourself off a cliff and assemble
your airplane on the way down’; the more so at the age of 45 while being intensely
immersed in business and, not least, a dedicated family father of two teenagers.
Converting a PhD thesis (Khezri 2021) into book format, i.e., something more
readable, is another endeavor of its own. In retrospect, it just feels like ‘probable
impossibilities’. But there is a neat structure underlying impossibilities: ﬁrst-order
principles. In a nutshell, this is the essence of the topic of this book: free-energy
minimization. Pick any goal: there is a path of ‘least action’. The journey starts with
epistemic and pragmatic foraging.
Acknowledgments generally consist of a list of individuals and instituions that
have meaningfully inﬂuenced and determined a presented output. But for any person
or institution to enter one’s life and contribute to one’s endeavors, we must en-act
our environment ﬁrst: to have a purpose, one must reach out beyond the self,
equipped with a sense of urgency, listening carefully with all senses, considerate
of choices, and progressing by way of active (generative) inference. This is the
essence of presencing (Scharmer 2018): ‘a gateway to a ﬁeld of future possibilities,
the highest future potential’. It is a journey that sometimes is simply and most
potently summarized as a social ﬁeld of interactions with a select number of
individuals exercising a special place and role in one’s life. Above all, I must
thank my parents, in particular my mother. She instilled a ‘thinking born of curios-
ity’, continuously encouraging me at a very young age to reach out beyond the self
and explore. She gifted the seeds of curiosity and cultivated conﬁdence in action to
continuously develop new eyes.
The very acknowledgments expressed as part of my doctoral thesis equally apply
to this book, in particular with regard to my supervisors, Professors Nils Jent and
Martin Hilb, at the University of St. Gallen. They both literally ‘opened the gates’ to
a new developmental path and social ﬁeld, ﬁnally encouraging me to convert the
thesis into book format to make its contents more widely accessible. I am deeply
grateful for their trust, support, and continuous encouragement. Throughout my

academic development, Professor Oliver Gassmann, Director of the Institute of
Management and Technology at the University of St. Gallen, stands out. Oliver
has been a critical and supportive advisor, guiding me to take the right decisions at
crucial junctures. I am deeply grateful for his support and friendship.
It was Oliver
who introduced me to Springer Nature. Dr. Prashanth
Mahagaonkar, Executive Editor, has embraced the book proposal from the ﬁrst
day. Ramya Prakash diligently managed the publishing process. I am grateful for
their advice and support.
I had the privilege of working with and learning from great entrepreneurs and
ﬁnanciers. Each one of them has shaped the many paths that have continuously
enriched my life. Unfortunately, despite all entrepreneurial genius (which is often
negatively correlated to managerial talent), one too many could not resist being
succumbed to capital markets’ quarterly pressures, eventually leading to the pitiful
trap that excessive ﬁnancial control beholds. The ﬁrm’s survival is usually at risk
long before one admits to realize.
My business partnership with Jürg Marquard coincided with the PhD studies,
allowing me to build a fascinating real-time bridge between practice and theory on
the back of what Jürg had built over 50 years of successful entrepreneurship. I am
deeply grateful to Jürg for our partnership and unique friendship and, above all, to the
exceptional senior leadership team at Marquard Media Group: Benjamin Sterbenz,
Christian Müller, Phillip Schuster, Rainer Rosenbusch, and Zsuzsanna Óhidi. You
have embraced Free Energy Governance as a natural way of organizing and
becoming!
It is an honor to have Professor Karl Friston, the world’s leading neuroscientist,
and Professor Constance Helfat, one of the most renown strategy scholars, each
contribute a Foreword. No book author could ask for a more unique and for this
subject matter certainly more beﬁtting combination. If this book has any lasting
relevance, then it is because their respective forewords symbolize the opening of a
new multi-disciplinary conversation. Both Karl and Connie are scholars of the very
highest accomplishments. The contents of this book have drawn their attention, I
believe, for reasons that usually do tend to subsequently set free the best in
scholarship: the multidisciplinary potential of the topic or simply an outsider’s
input to provide new momentum to topics that somehow are calling for a fresh
perspective.
This book attempts to show that if we take the trouble to look to the side, at the domains of
other disciplines, we shall gain a different conception of the entire landscape. (Olson 1982)
As I am writing these last words, a naturally mutating epidemic continues taking
its toll—in human lives as well as devalued purchasing power, following inﬂationary
ﬁscal and monetary policies. A coronavirus—which is dead to start with but
awakens to life within the inﬂammatory bounds of the human body—is crystalizing
the very limitations of policy-making institutions, the ill-preparedness of healthcare
systems, the blind faith in government-sponsored scientiﬁc assertions, and most
regrettably, the inﬂammatory decadence of the human state of health (physically and
mentally).

Acknowledgments and Epilogue

Before worrying about our planet’s sustainability, we should be concerned about
the very well-being and survival of the human specie; not because of the conse-
quences of human-inﬂicted environmental deterioration but humans’ self-decaying
life-style choices. Nature is mindless and one-sided as Alan Lightman (2021) rightly
states. Nature is self-organizing and regenerating. The universe is expanding at an
accelerating rate. Eventually, the sun will no longer ignite and planet Earth will be
quarantined within the multiverse, with no life left whatsoever. The discourse that is
missing today is how humans can regain autonomy of their very well-being indi-
vidually and collectively. Bodily self-awareness and self-discipline will naturally
align the human specie with nature. Indeed, it is a matter of survival. The organiza-
tional artifacts humans create suffer from the very same destructive forces that
humans’ distortions inﬂict upon nature’s autopoietic balance: we are disconnected
from the universe’s self-organizing information system. ‘History is nothing but a
procession of false Absolutes, a series of temples raised to pretexts, a degrada-
tion of the mind before the Improbable’ (Cioran 1975). We need revolt to change.
I dare to predict that we are past the mid-point of the Fourth Turning (Strauss and
Howe 1997). Financial crises (2007/08; 2022/23), pandemics (COVID-19-), and
great power wars (Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) are only symptoms of the ﬁnal
stages of a cycle coming to an end. “The question now is whether the events we are
witnessing are preparing another open and level ground for a reawakened animal
faith and the creation of undreamed-of new things, or whether on the contrary our
sullen doings have reached repetition in futility’ (Barzun 1989), making a total
collapse inevitable. I am conﬁdent that a FEG-inspired approach—engaging and
leveraging the intelligence of every member—can master continuous transformation
and reinvention, without the devastation of systemic collapse. But time is running
out. For now, “[t]he majority have ceased to believe what they believed before, but
they still affect to believe, and this empty phantom of public opinion is strong
enough to chill innovators and to keep them silent and at a respectful distance”
(De Tocqueville 2000; originally published in 1863).
At the very end, my gratitude goes to my life. It is best described as a unique
combination of family love, a toughened physiology thanks to a passion for open-sea
swimming all-year round, a drive to learn and listen with all senses, energizing
dialogues in trivial daily encounters, and not least the joys of investing, leading and
owning businesses. My generation’s average life expectancy is approaching 100.
Everything to date has been mere learning and, increasingly, unlearning. It feels like
the real journey is yet to start. With an expectation of 50 more years to go, I envision
the great learnings and encounters that curiosity will enact. There is nothing more
enriching than to humbly engage with the world as an eternal student. Maybe this is
the very essence of freedom.
With all my heart, this book is dedicated to Mila and our children Alexi and
Stella:
thinking born of curiosity, revolt, and change.
