CHAPTER IX.
FEOM GEMINUS TO PTOLEMY (B.C. 70—A.D. 150).
147. IF the materials for a history of Greek geometry in
the second century B. C. are scanty, they become still more so
for the next 250 years. Only a few works, and those not of a
very valuable character, survive from this period.
About 70 B.c. lived Geminus of Rhodes* who seems to have
been the freedman of a wealthy Roman and who wrote, beside
the astronomical work elcraycoyr) els-TO <f>aiv6fieva, still extant2,

which they are explained.

das has Ye/dmos, ovogua Kiipiov. In the 6th
chapter of hia Phaenomena Geminus
says "The Greeks suppose the feast of
Ms to fall on the shortest day. So it
did once, 120 years ago, but every four
years the incidence is shifted a day
and is now a month behind." If the
feast of Isis here mentioned could be
exactly identified, there would be no
difficulty in finding the date of Ge-
minus. But there are two dates in
the Egyptian calendar (the 1st and
17th of Athyr) on both of which some
sort of feast to Isis seems to have been
held and calculations founded on both
these give77B.c.andl37 B.O. as the dates

tained abundant notices of the early history of Greek mathe-
matics and from which Proclus and Eutocius1 derived much
of their most correct and valuable information on that subject.
A book of this kind, written not long after the classical age by
a competent geometer, would, if preserved, have cleared up a
hundred difficulties which do not now admit of solution.
148. Probably near to the time of Geminus lived Theo-
dosius (? of Tripolis), who is mentioned by Strabo and Vitruvius
and must therefore be a pre-Christian writer, though Suidas
attributes to him a commentary on one Theudas of Trajan's
time2. He is the author of Sphaerica, a very complete treatise
on the geometry of the sphere, in three books3. It was remarked
above, however, on the subject of Euclid's Phaenomena, that
both that and the treatise of Theodosius are evidently founded
on some earlier work on Spherics, perhaps by Eudoxus. The
work of Theodosius contains no trigonometry (a spherical triangle
is not mentioned) and there is nothing particularly interesting
either in his style or in his discoveries, if indeed he made any.
The character of his propositions will be sufficiently indicated
by the following enunciations. I. 13, " If in a sphere a great
circle cut another circle at right angles, it bisects it and passes
through its poles." (i. 14, 15 are the converse of this.) u. 22,
" If in a sphere a great circle touch another (second) circle and
cut a third which is parallel to the second and lies between it
and the centre, and if the pole of the great circle lies between
the two parallel circles, then any great circles which touch the
third will be inclined to the (first) great circle, and that will be

at the greatest inclination (6p96raro<i) which touches the third
at the point of bisection of its greater segment, and that will be
at least inclination (Ta7rewoTaTos) which touches it at the
bisection of its lesser segment, etc. \
Strabo, also, (xii. 3) mentions Dionysodorus, a native of
Amisus in Pontus, who seems to be the mathematician who, like
Diocles, attempted to finish the problem (Sph. et Gyl. u. 5),' to
cut a sphere so that its segments shall be in a given ratio', which
Archimedes had left incomplete. But Eutocius (Torelli p. 163,
169) complains of both that they did not fill up the gap in Archi-
medes' solution but produced entirely different proofs of their own.
149. Serenus of Antissa, in Lesbos, lived after Christ.
Bretschneider, indeed, who pointed out (pp. 183—184) that
Antissa was destroyed by the Romans B.C. 1672, was inclined to
place Serenus about 200 B.C., but the name Serenus is Roman
and the town Antissa was restored in Strabo's time3, so it is
probable that Serenus lived under the Roman regime*. He is
not mentioned, however, by any writer earlier than Marinus,
the pupil of Proclus (A.D. 500), and author of the preface to
Euclid's Data. His work, however, does not seem to be very
late and he may be placed here in default of better authority.
He is the author of two treatises, one on the Section of the
Cylinder in 35 propositions, the other on the Section of the
Gone in 63, both of which are printed as an appendix to Halley's
edition of Apollonius. The treatise on the Cone, which is
addressed to one Cyrus, deals entirely with the triangular
section. E.g. Props. 5 and 6 are " If a right cone be cut by
planes through the vertex and the axis be not less than the
radius of the base, then the triangle through the axis is the
greatest of the triangles so produced". Prop. 21, "To cut a

scalene cone through the vertex so that the section shall be an
isosceles triangle". Prop. 22, "Such isosceles triangle is the
greatest of the triangular sections of the scalene cone: the least
is that which is produced by a plane perpendicular to the base".
From this point onwards the book deals almost entirely with
maxima and minima. The treatise on the Cylinder, which is
addressed to the same friend Cyrus, deals with all the sections,
but chiefly the elliptical. Prop. 19 shews that the same ellipse
can be. produced by sections of a cone and a cylinder. Props.
21 and 22 are "Given a cone (cylinder) and an ellipse in it, to
find the cylinder (cone) of which the same ellipse is a section".
Props. 22 and .23 are "Given a cone (cylinder), to find a
cylinder (cone), such that the section of both by the same plane
produces the same ellipse". Prop. 31 is "The straight lines
which are drawn from the same point to touch a cylinder have
their points of contact on the sides of a parallelogram". Prop.
33 is important as being the foundation of the modern theory
of harmonics. It is as follows:
If from the point 8, outside the triangle a/3y, the straight
line Serf be drawn cutting the triangle in e, f, and the point 17
be taken so that Be : 8f = «?: ?;£ and X17 be joined and produced
to meet the base, any other transversal S/cXfi, shall be so divided
by av produced that 8K:8H = K\: 
X/X.. With the aid of this it
is proved (Prop. 34) that all straight lines drawn from the same
point to touch a cone, have their points of contact on the sides
of a triangle. Then comes the last proposition (35 which is
similar in kind to Prop. 32). It is as follows. ABO is a triangle,
BE, FO are parallel to its base. From a point H, not in the
plane of the triangle draw HD, HE, HF, HG and produce them

to meet a plane KLXMN, which is at all points equidistant
from ABC. 
The plane HDKE will cut
this second plane in KN, and the plane
HFLG will cut it in LM, and KN, LM
are parallel to DE, FG. Also KL, DF
are parallel and MN, GE. Therefore KL,
NM produced will meet. Let them meet
in X. Then the triangles XKN, ABC are
similar. " Now if the point H be supposed
to be an illuminating point and the tri-
angle ABC (whether per se or in a cone)
be opposite its rays, then the rays will
make the shadow KNX triangular and similar to ABC. Although
this consideration belongs to optics and on that account is
alien to our subject, yet it is clear that without the proofs here
given concerning the cone and the cylinder, I mean about the
ellipse and its tangents, it is impossible to solve a problem of
this kind: wherefore not carelessly but on purpose the subject
has here been introduced1."
A lemma of Serenus, on angles which stand on equal arcs
of a circle, is preserved in the Astronomy of Theon Smyrnseus2,
but there is no evidence to shew how it came there. Theon
lived about 130 A.D. and may have himself used Serenus.
150. One date in the life of Menelaus is absolutely certain.
Ptolemy3 records two astronomical observations made by him
in the first year of Trajan, A.D. 98. He was the author of a lost
work on the calculation of chords, but his Sphaerica in 3 books,
though not extant in Greek, is extant in Arabic and Hebrew
and has been often translated into Latin4. This is a treatise
on spherical triangles, describing their properties in much the
same way as Euclid, in Book I. of the Elements, treats plane

triangles. But there is no attempt at solution of the triangles,
and though in Book in. the first proposition is the foundation
of the ancient method of solution, Menelaus makes no such
use of it. His propositions are of the following kind. In every
spherical triangle any two sides are greater than the third (i. 5):
the sum of the three angles is greater than two right angles (i. 11):
equal sides subtend equal angles and the greatest side the greatest
angle (i. 8, 9): the arcs which bisect the angles meet in a point
(in. 9): the arc which bisects any angle cuts the opposite side
into two segments, such that the chords of twice the segments1
are to one another as the chords of twice the other sides (in. 6).
The chief proposition (ill. 1) describes two properties of plane and
spherical triangles, cut by a transversal. The property of plane
triangles (stated in a lemma) is that if the three sides be cut
by a straight line, the product of three segments which have no
common extremity is equal to the product of the other three2.
For spherical triangles, the rule is similar, but for "three
segments" read "the chords of three segments doubled". "The
proposition in plane geometry " says Chasles " of which we shall
speak below in the article on Ptolemy (because it is in the
Almagest that it has generally been noticed) has acquired a
new and great importance in recent geometry, where the illus-
trious Carnot has introduced it, making it the base of his theory
of transversals9." The theorem on spherical triangles was greatly
admired by the Arabs, who called it " the rule of intersection ":
early mediaeval writers called it by its Arabic name catha, and
it was known later by another name, regula sex quantitatumi.
Pappus (IV. p. 270) says that Menelaus, and also two otherwise
unknown geometers, Demetrius of Alexandria and Philon of
Tyana, investigated curves on curved surfaces. One of these was
called irapaSofo? 7/aa/i/M?, but Pappus does not describe it.

the Greeks, is derived from two chapters of the famous MeyaXr/
"XvvTatjis;1 of Claudius Ptolemseus. This work contains many as-
tronomical observations by Ptolemy himself, of which the earliest
was made in A.D. 125, the latest in A.D. 151. Beyond these facts
and also that Ptolemy certainly observed in Alexandria in
A.D. 139, we know nothing of his history. The Arabs indeed
have many details upon his personal appearance, etc., but these
statements betray the romancer by their minuteness.2. The
common name fieyaXrj 2iWa.£t? was altered by still more
fervent admirers into /xeyiarr] and this word was adopted by
the Arabs who got translations of the book earlier probably
than of any other Greek mathematical work. The Arabic article
was then added and the name corrupted into Almidschisti,
whence is derived its common mediaeval title Almagest3.
Book I. chap. IX. of the Almagest, shews how to calculate a
table of chords4. The circle is divided into 360 degrees (rfirj-
fiara) each of which is halved: its diameter into 120 degrees
each of which is divided into 60 minutes, 3600 seconds {irpwra
e^TjKocrrd, Bevrepa e^rjKoaTa). Ptolemy does not pretend that
these divisions were new. The division of the circle was, among
Greeks, as old as Hypsicles and was of Babylonian origin: the
sexagesimal scale of the division of the diameter shews it also
to have been Babylonian, and, as such, it was no doubt known
at least to Hipparchus, though it is not now to be found before
Ptolemy5. But Ptolemy's method of calculating chords seems to

be his own. The measures of the sides of regular polygons,
as chords of certain arcs, were known in terms of the diameter.
Some of these Ptolemy first sets out. He next proves the
proposition, now appended to Euclid VI. (D), that " the rect-
angle contained by the diagonals of a quadrilateral inscribed in
a circle is equal to both the rectangles contained by its opposite
sides1", and then proceeds to shew how from the chords of two
arcs that of their sum and difference and how from the chord of
any arc that of its half may be found. His proofs which are
very pretty are as follows2:
(1) Given the chords a/3, ay, it is required to find /3<y.
Draw the diameter a8 and join yS, @8. Then 7S =
/38 = JVM^tfF, 
and ay. 08 = /3y. aS + a/3. 7S. 
Therefore
ayJl202-afi2 
= 120Py + a/3jl2Q*-ay\ 
whence /3y can be
found.
(2) Given the chord f3y, it is re-
quired to find the chord 78 of half
the same arc. Draw the diameter
cry and join aft, a8, f38. In 07 take
ae = a/3. Join Be and draw 8f per-
pendicular to 07. The triangles a/38,
a8e are equal, and their sides /38, 8e are equal. But
therefore the triangles 8e£ 8fy are equal. Therefore

But the triangles <y%8, 7x8 are similar, therefore £7: 78:: 78 : ay,
whence 7S2 = ay . £7 = 120 (60 - ^JlW^fiy1). 
From this 78
can be found.
(3) 
Given the chords a/3, fty, it is
required to find the chord 07. Draw
the diameters a8, /3e and join /38, 87,
76, Se. 
The triangles a£/8, 8£e are
equal and a/3 = e8. Then the diagonals

= ^ 7 . a/3 +120 Vl20 2-a 7
2,
whence a7 can be found.
Eeturning then to the known chords (or sides of polygons),
Ptolemy finds from the chords of 72° and 60° the chord of 12°.
From this the chord of 6°, 3°, 1J0, |°. His intention, however,
is to give a table of the chords of arcs, increasing successively
by £°. He requires therefore to find the chord of 1°. This he
effects in the following manner.

the approximation chord 1° = 1. 2'. 50". 
The chord 1^° is
known and hence also the chord |°, and the table of all chords,
rising by half a degree at a time, can be compiled. Ptolemy
goes only as far as 180°, on the ground only that he never
requires arcs of greater magnitude. For arcs which lie between
tiny two given in the table, Ptolemy applies merely a proportion.
For instance, the arc 20° has a chord 20 . 50'. 16", the arc 20£°,
has a chord 21. 21'. 12". The addition of half a degree to the
arc corresponds to an addition, of 30' 56" to the chord. 
This
increase, divided by 30, is 1' 1" 52'" and this is taken to be the
increase in the chord for every increase of a minute in the arc
between 20° and 20° 30' *.

tions". These begin with the lemma of Menelaus, the regula
sex quantitatum, borrowed without any acknowledgement. After
proving this, he gives four proposi-
tions. If AB, BG be two arcs,
each less than a semicircle ("a
supposition which can be made of
all arcs to be hereafter taken") and
AG be joined and BD be drawn to 
A 
-=
the centre D, cutting AG in E,
then the chord of 2AB : chord of 2BG :: AE: EG. From this
it follows that, given the arc A G and the ratios of the chords of
2AB, 2BG, the arcs AB, BG can be found. Produce GB to
meet DA in F. Then chord 2GA : chord 2AB :: GF: BF.
From this it follows that, given arc GB only and the ratio
between the chords of 2GA, 2AB, the arc AB can be found.
These propositions being proved, Ptolemy then proves the regula
sex quantitatum for a spherical triangle, and proceeds (Chap, XII.)
to find the magnitudes of the arcs above-mentioned, and
(Chap, xili.) " the magnitudes of arcs of the equator which lie
between circles which pass through its poles and through given
points of the ecliptic". The method, in both cases, is founded on
the rule of Menelaus.
ABGD represents a great circle, passing through the poles
of the equator A G. BED is the eclip-
tic : E is the vernal equinox; B the
winter, and D the summer, solstice.
Z is the pole of the equator. On the
ecliptic take an arc HE, and through
H describe the great circle ZHT. 
It
is required to find the magnitudes of
HT (Chap. XII.) and TE (Chap. xni.).
Ptolemy gives the solutions only for

of Menelaus is, later on, applied in a great many ways to this
same figure, for there are four triangles, EHT, ZHB, ZTA, EBA,
which are cut by the following transversals respectively, ZBA,
ETA, BHE, ZHT. One example (ch. xii.) will serve for an illus-
tration. ETA is a transversal to the triangle ZHB.

i.e. chord 2ZA = 120 .2 arc AB is 47° 42' 40", its chord 48.31'. 55".
2 arc HE is 60°, its chord 60. 2 arc #B is 180°, its chord 120.
" If from the ratio 120 : 48 . 31' . 55" we subtract (d<f>ek£fiev)
that of 60 : 120, the remainder will be the ratio chord
2TZ : chord 2TH, i.e. 120 : 24.15' 57". But 2TZ = 180°, its
chord 120. 
Therefore chord 2TH =24.15' 57", its arc is
23° 9' 59" therefore the arc TH is half this, viz. 11' 40" very
nearly1."
This paragraph contains in fact the whole of Greek trigono-
metry. The further progress of this department of geometry
is due mainly to the Indians and after them to the Arabians.
With the former, trigonometry seems, after its suggestion in
Ptolemy, to have had quite a native development. The Indians
never used "the chord of twice of the arc", as the Greeks always
did, but half that chord. This they called jydrdha or ardhajyd,
but the name of the whole chord jyd or jivd was also used for
shortness. The Arabs, taking the latter term, transliterated it
to dschiba, which later was altered for the Arabic word dschaib,
which is of nearly the same form. Dschaib means ' bosom' and
was therefore translated ' sinus' by Plato of Tivoli in his Latin
version ('De Motu Stellarum') of the astronomy of Albategnius2.

In this way, sine came to be a technical term of modern trigono-
metry. Further evidence of the distinct character of Indian
trigonometry is to be seen in their division of the diameter.
Ptolemy divided this into 120 parts with sexagesimal fractions
and so did the Arabs. The Indians divided it in various ways.
Dividing it into 120,000 parts they calculated the sides of
regular polygons of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 sides to be 103923, 84853,
70534, 60000, 52055 (for 52066), 45922, 41031 (for 41042)
respectively. 
Ptolemy (Almag. vi. 7) has TT = 3 . 8'. 30"
(= 3 + fo + sflfo = 3141, 666....) The oldest Indian tradition
makes ir = 3 or, more exactly, V10. Aryabhatta has f J§^§. This
value was obtained in the following way. If, in a circle with
radius unity, SH be the side of an inscribed regular polygon
of n sides, Sia that of a like polygon of 2n sides, then
Sin = j2, — j4<- 8a
2. From the side of the hexagon they calcu-
lated the sides of polygons of 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384 sides.
The periphery of the last (the diameter being taken = 100) is
V 98694. This square root or rather that of 986,940,000 is
exactly Aryabhatta's value1.
152. The applications of trigonometry in Book II. of the
Almagest and the geometry of eccentric circles and epicycles in
Book III. belong too distinctly, by language and purpose, to the
history of astronomy to be described here. Besides the Alma-
gest, Ptolemy wrote also many other works, most of which are
extant. The Geography (edited by the Abbe* Halma, Paris 1828)
contains a description of the earth, defining the position of many
thousand places by latitude and longitude. Book I., chap. 24 con-
tains directions for drawing a map and various modes of projec-

the eye is supposed to be at the pole and points on the earth's
surface are projected on the plane of the equator1. He wrote
also a Canon or chronological list of kings of various countries
(also ed. Halma), a treatise on Sound (Ap/iovi/cd, ed. Wallis,
Oxford, 1682) and another on Optics, extant only in a Latin trans-
lation from the Arabic. The 5th book of the Optics deals with
refraction, in which, as an astronomer, Ptolemy was especially
interested". Cleomedes an earlier astronomer (A.D. 60) had
already suggested that the reason why stars are still seen, though
below the horizon, was due to the same cause as that which
renders a ring, previously unseen, visible when the vessel, which
contains it, is filled with water. But Ptolemy works up the
subject carefully. He compares rays passing through air and
water, air and glass, and water and glass. He finds as a general
law that a ray, passing from a rarer to a denser medium, is
refracted towards the perpendicular: if passing from a denser to
a rarer medium, away from the perpendicular: and he invented
a simple contrivance (a graduated circle with moveable spokes,
the lower half of which is placed in water) for the purpose of
ascertaining the amount of the refraction in water for various
angles of incidence3. Some works in astrology and metaphysics
probably not genuine, are also attributed to Ptolemy4, but,
Proclus (pp. 362—368) has preserved some extracts from a
work of his in pure geometry, from which it appears that he
also discussed the propriety of Euclid's famous 12th Axiom,
(sometimes printed as 11th), on parallel lines. He endeavoured
to prove it as a theorem in the following way. If the straight
