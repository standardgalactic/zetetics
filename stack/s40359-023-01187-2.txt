Abstract
Background  Lying flatism, a new emerging lifestyle by refusing to participate in consumerist lifestyles, is anticipated 
to be related to singlehood. Based on the Theory of Reasoned Action, we proposed a mediation model to examine 
the indirect relationship between feelings towards lying flatism and attitudes toward singlehood via individuals’ belief 
in that happiness can be achieved without romantic relationships (happiness belief).
Methods  Using purposive and snowball sampling methods, 232 single Malaysian young adults participated in an 
online experiment consisting of a writing task (to manipulate feelings toward lying flatism), single-item measures of 
manipulation checking and happiness belief, Attitudes toward Singlehood Scale, Negative Stereotyping of Single 
Persons Scale (a measure of singlism) and Fear of Being Single Scale.
Results  T-Test results support the writing task that successfully induced positive feelings toward lying flatism. 
Mediation analysis showed that the feelings toward lying flatism measured before the writing task, but not the 
manipulation of lying flatism, has an indirect relationship with attitudes toward singlehood via happiness belief, after 
controlling for gender, singlism, and fear of being single.
Conclusions  The findings offer preliminary support to the hypothetical relationships among feelings towards lying 
flatism, happiness belief, and attitudes toward singlehood. Implications of the findings are discussed.

factors [9]. These youngsters refuse to participate in con­
sumerist lifestyles such as going to work, purchasing for 
their material desire, involving in marriage or having 
children [10]. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that indi­
viduals who have positive feelings toward lying flatism 
are likely to have a positive attitudes toward singlehood. 
This assumption, however, has not been empirically 
tested in any context. Furthermore, how lying flatism 
is related to attitudes toward singlehood also remains 
unknown. As lying flatists tend to live without marriage 
or romantic relationships [11] to avoid the pressure of 
modern urban life [10], they believe that happiness could 
be achieved without a romantic relationship (hereinafter 
referred to as happiness belief). Therefore, it is believed 
that happiness belief plays a mediator role in the relation­
ship between feelings toward lying flatism and attitudes 
toward singlehood.
The hypothetical mediation model is congruent with 
the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) [12, 13]. Accord­
ing to the TRA, behavior is primarily predicted by an 
individual’s intention to carry out that behavior. This 
intention is influenced by two components: attitudes 
and subjective norms, which operate through separate 
routes. Attitudes toward behavior are shaped by an indi­
vidual’s beliefs about the consequences of the behavior 
(i.e., behavioral beliefs), while subjective norms are influ­
enced by an individual’s perception of the expectations of 
significant others (i.e., normative beliefs). Additionally, 
background factors such as emotions and education play 
a role as antecedent factors in shaping behavioral and 
normative beliefs [14]. In this study, we focused on the 
pathway from background factors to behavioral beliefs to 
attitudes towards behavior. Specifically, we used feelings 
towards lying flatism, happiness beliefs, and attitudes 
toward singlehood as proxies for the background factor, 
behavioral beliefs, and attitudes toward behavior, respec­
tively, to construct the hypothetical mediation model.
In the remaining sections, we first reviewed the con­
cept of lying flatism, attitudes toward singlehood, and 
their relationship. Then, we reviewed happiness belief 
and its relationship with feelings toward lying flatism and 
attitudes toward singlehood respectively and provided an 
overview of the present study. Finally, we presented the 
methodology of the study and analysis results and dis­
cussed the findings and their implications.
Lying flatism
Lying flatism is a trending philosophy introduced in an 
April 2022 online post named “Lying down flat signi­
fies justice (躺平即是正义)” on Baidu Tieba, a mainland 
China forum [15, 16]. Resulted from an anti-consumer­
ism movement [16], lying flatism refers to a state of living 
in which individuals are not having desires in their life, 
not focusing on anything, and are not willing to move 
forward [17]. People who practice lying flatism (or lying 
flatists) reduce their materialistic desires, refuse job pro­
motions, disengage in romantic relationships, deny house 
or car purchases, and forgo marriage and children [18, 
19]. Instead of working hard in fighting for better lives, 
lying flatists only wish to maintain the lowest possible 
standards of living, focus on their feelings, and live in 
their current moments [16, 20, 21].
The emergence of the lying flatism can attribute to two 
reasons. First, lying flatism is attributed to the severe 
working overtime culture in the China Industry [22]. 
For instance, China’s technology workers have a well-
known extreme overtime system named 996: working for 
12 h per day (from 9 am to 9 pm) and 6 days per week 
[23]. This hustle culture imposes intense pressure on the 
employees. The workers relentlessly feel exhausted and 
frustrated with the working system, and hence start prac­
ticing lying flatism to escape from the stressful circum­
stances and to take rests. Second, individuals adopt lying 
flatism to protest silently against the feeling of unfairness 
[9]. Lying flatism is recognized as a non-violent way of 
resisting the capital system and exploitation by capitalists 
[17]. It is essential to note that lying flatism is conceptu­
ally different from minimalist lifestyle, which revolves 
around utilizing only items that have a practical purpose, 
adopting a simple way of life, and possessing only what is 
essential for one’s daily routines. On the contrary, indi­
viduals lie flat to have control of their destiny and not be 
a money-making machine for capitalists [9].
Singlehood
Singlehood refers to a state of being unmarried or not 
involved in a romantic relationship [24, 25] and has been 
assumed to be an attitude and expression of choice to 
stay single [1]. Apostolou [26] has discussed individuals’ 
singlehood decisions using the fitness-increasing strat­
egy. Individuals are willing to stay single and invest in 
themselves for their improvement, thus becoming more 
attractive and having better qualities in attaining bet­
ter mates in the future mating market. Apostolou and 
colleagues [27] have also concluded several reasons for 
being single. The most common factors include poor 
flirting skills, retaining one’s freedom, fear of being hurt, 
owning different priorities, and being too picky. More­
over, men are more likely to stay single as they desire the 
freedom to flirt, while women stay single to avoid getting 
hurt besides perceiving themselves as undesirable mate. 
Similar findings are also documented in bachelorhood 
research. For example, both male and female bachelors 
associated bachelorhood with freedom, independence, 
and psychological stability [28], while single men who 
gave up involvement in a romantic relationship in China 
because of their physical appearance and income [29].

Attitudes toward singlehood (AtS)
A romantic relationship is the most crucial relationship 
among most adults [30]. Individuals engaging in roman­
tic relationships or marriage have higher well-being (e.g., 
happiness, life satisfaction, positive affect) and lower dis­
tress compared to singles [3, 31–35]. On the contrary, the 
absence of companionship is a common cause of individ­
uals’ fear of being single [36], which is negatively corre­
lated with one’s well-being [1].
However, it has been found that staying single can be 
beneficial to individuals’ well-being [3, 37]. Individuals 
who are always single can be as happy as individuals who 
are currently married [38]. Indeed, single individuals can 
cultivate higher life satisfaction [39] and healthier men­
tal conditions [40] by maintaining a high quality of social 
connection [25]. Single individuals have better control 
over their time as they can focus on their schedules with­
out worrying about their partners’ [41, 42]. Moreover, 
single individuals are free from maintaining their part­
ners’ expectations to keep attracting their romantic part­
ners [43]. They can also save their money and enjoy the 
freedom to control their finance [44, 45].
Meanwhile, the inconsistent findings of the relation­
ship between singlehood and well-being could be due to 
people’s choice to stay single (i.e., involuntary vs. volun­
tary singlehood). Involuntary singlehood refers to people 
experiencing difficulties in attracting a partner due to 
poor qualities [46], while voluntary singlehood refers to 
people being single of their own will [1]. To better under­
stand people’s view of singlehood, Tan and colleagues 
[37] developed the Attitudes toward Singlehood Scale 
(AtSS) to examine people’s attitudes toward singlehood 
from the affective, behavioral, and cognitive aspects. Tan 
and colleagues found that individuals who have positive 
attitudes toward singlehood tend to have a higher level of 
life satisfaction and well-being.
The relationship between lying flatism and 
attitudes toward singlehood
It is assumed that lying flatism has a positive relationship 
with attitudes toward singlehood. According to News qq 
[47], more and more young adults are choosing to stay 
single and insisting on the “lying-flat view of romantic 
relationships (躺平式恋爱观)”. They are satisfied with 
their singlehood status and prefer to maintain calm and 
plain lifestyles to avoid fearfulness when people approach 
them and interrupt their lives [16, 47], or it could result 
from anxiety brought by past unsuccessful relationships 
[48]. A similar pattern has also been witnessed in Japan. 
Japanese with the mindset of lying flatism namely the 
Satori generation (さとり世代, Satori Sedai) do not strive 
to earn more money, but instead choose to live modestly 
(e.g., valuing simple pleasures), distance themselves from 
mainstream values of consumerism, prioritize a pursuit 
of happiness rooted in simplicity, and are not interested 
in romantic relationships [49, 50]. It is claimed that the 
latter could promote the development of positive atti­
tudes toward singlehood [41].
The mediating role of happiness belief
As reviewed, lying flatism is assumed to have a positive 
relationship with attitudes toward singlehood. How­
ever, it is believed that there is an indirect relationship 
between the two constructs. In this section, we reviewed 
the theoretical and empirical rationales for the hypo­
thetical mediating role of happiness belief in the associa­
tion between feelings toward lying flatism and attitudes 
toward singlehood.
The relationship between lying flatism and happiness 
belief
There are three reasons to assume a positive relationship 
between lying flatism and the belief that happiness can be 
achieved without a romantic relationship. First, individu­
als who follow the lying flatism perspective prefer lives 
with minimum spending [11]. To achieve that goal, they 
avoid having romantic relationships, marriage, and chil­
dren [11, 21] which will cost them some resources like 
time and money [26]. In other words, staying single helps 
lying flatists to control their finance [43] by reducing 
expenses (i.e., retaining more resources for themselves) 
and living a minimum-spending lifestyle. Consequently, 
they can enjoy their lives [20], feel blessed by their cur­
rent condition [51], and experience happiness in a differ­
ent way [16].
Second, staying single leads lying flatists to experience 
happiness by having a sense of control. In certain societ­
ies such as China and Malaysia, success in life is defined 
as getting married and having children [20, 52], while 
staying single represents a social failure [53]. Attain­
ing romantic relationships, marriage, and children are 
always demanded not only by the parents but also by 
members of society [41]. However, lying flatists are more 
settled with living lives in their ways instead of fulfilling 
the social demand [15, 17, 54]. When lying flatists can 
control their lives by defying social demands (i.e., engag­
ing in a romantic relationship), they are living joyously 
because individuals who possess a higher ability to con­
trol life events are associated with superior well-being 
[55]. Finally, engaging or retaining a romantic relation­
ship can be stressful [56] and detrimental to one’s happi­
ness [57, 58]. By avoiding overwhelming stress [59], they 
could feel relieved without worrying about the end of a 
romantic relationship in them [54].
Taken together, individuals who have positive feelings 
toward lying flatism are likely to believe that their hap­
piness can be achieved without engaging in a romantic

relationship as they can reserve resources, have higher 
control, and reduce stress when staying single.
The relationship between happiness belief and attitudes 
toward singlehood
Literature (e.g., [38, 60]) has shown that single individu­
als can be as happy and healthy as their married coun­
terparts. The belief in happiness without engaging in 
romantic relationships can be positively associated with 
positive attitudes toward singlehood among single peo­
ple contented with their current lifestyles. The associa­
tion could result from two reasons. First, single people 
can obtain a sense of belonging from supportive social 
networks (e.g., friends, and family) other than romantic 
relationships. The intimate connections with friends and 
family not only promote single individuals’ well-being 
[39, 40] but also reduce their loneliness in the absence of 
romantic relationships [25]. Second, as reviewed above, 
staying single allows people to enjoy benefits such as hav­
ing more freedom and a less financial burden [43]. Some 
young adults have different life priorities [26]; they are 
not interested in getting romantic partners because they 
can accomplish well-being (e.g., a sense of achievement) 
by focusing on their career paths [41].
Taken together, people who have supportive social net­
works and enjoy the benefits of singlehood are likely to 
believe that well-being can be achieved without romantic 
relationships and hence, they tend to have positive atti­
tudes toward singlehood [41].
The present study
Both lying flatism and voluntary singlehood are new and 
rising trends in the young generation. The present study 
aimed to expand our understanding of these individual 
choices by examining whether and how feelings toward 
lying flatism are related to attitudes toward singlehood. 
To our best knowledge, measurement of the state-like 
lying flatism is not available. Hence, we manipulated peo­
ple’s feelings toward lying flatism using a writing task to 
understand if having a positive (vs. neutral) view of lying 
flatism influences one’s happiness belief and attitudes 
toward singlehood. In addition, we focused on young 
adults in Malaysia because the proportion of singles has 
been increasing gradually in Malaysia over the years [53].
The present study adopted a part of the TRA to explain 
the relationships among feelings toward lying flatism, 
happiness belief, and attitudes toward singlehood. Spe­
cifically, it is hypothesized that (1) feelings towards 
lying flatism have a positive relationship with happiness 
belief, (2) feelings toward lying flatism have a positive 
relationship with attitudes toward singlehood, (3) happi­
ness belief is positively associated with attitudes toward 
singlehood, (4) happiness belief mediates the relation­
ship between feelings toward lying flatism and attitudes 
toward singlehood. In addition, we statistically controlled 
for three variables (i.e., singlism, fear of being single, and 
gender) to get rid of their confounding effects on the rela­
tionships among the three target variables.
The present study is expected to shed light on the 
inquiry of whether and how lying flatism plays a role in 
shaping people’s positive attitudes toward singlehood. 
The findings will not only broaden our understanding of 
lying flatism but may also offer insights into the negative 
impact of lying flatism on the birth rate.
Method
Participants and research design
The present study adopts a quantitative cross-sectional 
research design. According to Xin [9], lying flatism is 
embraced by generation Z who were born between 1997 
and 2012 (i.e., aged 9 to 24 in 2021). Hence, individuals 
aged 18 to 24 served as the target population of the pres­
ent study as lying flatists are mostly composed of individ­
uals within this age range [61]. Purposive and snowball 
sampling methods were used to recruit participants who 
fulfilled the following selection criteria: (a) aged between 
18 and 24 years old, (b) single (i.e., currently not in a 
romantic relationship), and (c) Malaysian who is cur­
rently residing in Malaysia.
According to the Monte Carlo Power Analysis for 
Indirect Effects [62], a minimum of 225 participants are 
needed to achieve a power of 0.95. Although a total of 
522 responses were recorded, 290 responses were omit­
ted from the data analysis due to failure in the attention 
checking item (90 cases), violation of the inclusion cri­
teria (68 cases), not answering the survey except for the 
demographic Sect. (62 cases), violation of essay instruc­
tion (40 cases), not giving consent to participate (25 
cases), not answering one of the measurements (4 cases), 
and univariate outlier (1 case). The remaining 232 suc­
cessful responses were retained and submitted for further 
data analysis.
The sample consisted of 139 females (59.9%) and 93 
males (40.1%) with ages ranging from 18 to 24 (M = 21.37, 
SD = 1.332). In terms of ethnicity, the majority were Chi­
nese (86.6%), followed by Indians (6.9%), Malays (5.6%), 
and other ethnic groups (0.9%). Most of the participants 
never engaged in a romantic relationship (62.5%). All 
the participants were currently single (not in a romantic 
relationship) with the highest singlehood duration being 
less than 3 months (53.4%). In terms of working status, 
the majority of the participants were currently studying 
(88.4%), 19 participants (8.2%) were currently employed, 
three participants (1.3%) were undergoing internship, 
working as a freelancer, and waiting for a job offer, four 
participants were looking for a job (1.7%), and one miss­
ing value.

Instruments
The English version of the following instruments was 
used in the present study for data collection.
Manipulation of the feelings toward lying flatism and 
checking
Individuals’ feelings toward lying flatism were experi­
mentally manipulated in the present study using a writ­
ing task, which could be easily completed and is effective 
to manipulate self-awareness [63]. Participants were 
randomly assigned to the experimental group or control 
group. Then, all participants read a brief introduction 
about lying flatism and the instruction of writing an essay 
on the given topic.
To induce positive feelings toward lying flatism, partici­
pants in the experimental group were instructed to write 
an essay to indicate their support of lying flatism. Three 
sample statements regarding lying flatism: (1) Practising 
lying flatism allows individuals to stay away from stress­
ful circumstances; (2) Lying flatism allows us to live in the 
current movement and focus on our states of feelings; (3) 
Practising lying flatism can avoid pressure and expecta­
tions of family, friends, and society, were provided to help 
participants to understand the writing task.
On the other hand, participants in the control group 
were assigned to write an essay on a neutral topic 
“weather”. Similarly, they were provided with three ques­
tions as references to write about the topic. The questions 
and statements provided were (1) How is the weather 
today? Was it the same as yesterday’s? (2) In which month 
has the most comfortable weather occurred in your home­
town? (3) Share with us any interesting myths about the 
weather.
A single-item self-report (“To what extent are you feel­
ing positive toward lying flatism?”) was created to exam­
ine the effectiveness of the writing task in manipulating 
an individual’s feelings toward lying flatism. All partici­
pants answered twice on the single item using a 5-point 
Likert point from 1 (very negative) to 5 (very positive): 
before the commencement of the writing task (i.e., pre-
manipulation measure) and right after the completion 
of the writing task (i.e., post-manipulation measure). 
Individuals who score high tend to have positive feelings 
toward lying flatism. Moreover, the manipulation is con­
sidered effective if the post-manipulation measured score 
is higher than the pre-manipulation measured score and 
if the difference is statistically significant.
Happiness belief
We adapted and integrated the measures of the belief 
that happiness can be achieved without marriage for men 
and women [25] into a single-item measure of happiness 
belief. Participants rated the item “I believe that I can 
have full and happy lives without a romantic relationship” 
on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). 
The higher the score, the stronger the belief that happi­
ness can be achieved without a romantic relationship.
Attitudes toward singlehood scale
The Attitudes toward Singlehood Scale (AtSS) was used 
to measure the attitudes of young adults toward single­
hood [37]. The AtSS consists of 9 items with 3 items each 
for the affective, behavioral, and cognitive subscales. 
Sample items are I feel happy when I am single (affec­
tive subscale), I stay single to have more personal space 
(behavioral subscale), and Engaging in a romantic rela­
tionship is not important (cognitive subscale). Partici­
pants used a 7-point Likert point (1: strongly disagree; 
7: strongly agree) to indicate the extent to which they 
agreed with the items. A higher (average) score indicates 
higher participants’ positive attitudes toward single­
hood, and vice versa. The AtSS showed excellent reliabil­
ity in the present study with Cronbach alpha (α) = 0.91, 
McDonald omega (ω) = 0.91, and good validity for Malay­
sian young adults [37].
Control variables
Singlism
Singlism refers to the negative stereotype and discrimina­
tion toward individuals who are staying single [64]. The 
30-item Negative Stereotyping of Single Persons Scale 
(NSSP) [65] was used in the present study to measure 
an individual’s anti-singles attitude using a 7-point Lik­
ert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly 
agree). A higher average score represents a greater ste­
reotype. The NSSP demonstrated excellent reliability in 
the present study (α = 0.91, ω = 0.91).
Fear of being single
Fear of being single refers to a state of being anxious or 
distressed in the absence of a romantic partner or when 
staying single [36]. People who fear being single demand 
romantic partners as opposed to lying flatists who prefer 
single, calm, and plain lifestyles [16]. It is therefore rea­
sonable to assume that fear of being single may confound 
the relationship between lying flatism and attitudes 
toward singlehood.
A 6-item Fear of Being Single Scale (FBSS) was 
employed to measure the extent to which individuals 
fear being single [36]. Participants indicated their agree­
ment with the items using a 5-Likert point from 1 (not 
at all true) to 5 (very true). Higher (total) scores indicate 
a higher level of fear. The FBSS showed satisfactory reli­
ability in the present study (α = 0.79, ω = 0.79).
Gender
Tan and colleagues [34] found gender differences in 
attitudes toward singlehood scores. Male participants 

Page 6 of 12
Heng et al. BMC Psychology          (2023) 11:156 
were found to have a lower score than female partici­
pants. Hence, gender was included as a control variable 
in the present study to exclude the impacts of gender 
differences.
Research procedure
The study was conducted online due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. An online survey was created using Qual­
trics and then distributed through several social media 
platforms (e.g., Instagram, and Facebook). The data col­
lection was conducted from 20 to 2021 to 11 November 
2021.
After giving their consent, participants responded to 
the measures in the following sequence: demographic, 
NSSP and FBSS, the pre-manipulation measure of feel­
ings toward lying flatism, essay writing task, the post-
manipulation measure of feelings toward lying flatism, 
Happiness Belief, and AtSS. Participants were debriefed 
at the end of the study. Participants who completed the 
survey and passed the attention-checking items received 
a token of RM 5.00. The procedure was approved by the 
university’s Scientific and Ethical Review Committee 
(Ref: U/SERC/196/2021).
Analytical strategy
IBM SPSS version 21 was used to carry out the statisti­
cal analyses. A mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) with 
time (pre- vs. post-measured) as the within-subject fac­
tor, group condition (experimental vs. control group) 
as the between-subject factor, and feelings toward lying 
flatism as the outcome variable was conducted to mea­
sure if the written task manipulation is effective in induc­
ing participants’ positive feelings toward lying flatism. 
The proposed mediation model was tested using Model 6 
of the PROCESS SPSS Macro ver. 4.0 [66]. The mediating 
effect was examined with 10,000 bootstrapping and 95% 
percentile confidence intervals (CI). The effect is statisti­
cally significant if the CI does not include zero.
Results
Manipulation checking
The results of mixed ANOVA showed a significant 
within-subject effect of time and an interaction effect 
of time and group. The between-subject effect of the 
group was not significant. Simple effect tests were then 
conducted to clarify the interaction effect. Specifically, 
two independent sample t-Tests were first conducted to 
test the effectiveness of the writing task in manipulat­
ing participants’ feelings toward lying flatism. The first 
t-Test compared the pre-manipulation measured feelings 
toward lying flatism score between the experimental and 
control groups. Levene’s test was not statistically signifi­
cant, F(1,230) = 1.16, p = .282, indicating the assumption 
of equal variance was not violated. Results showed no 
significant difference between the experimental group 
(M = 2.83, SD = 0.90) and the control group (M = 2.86, 
SD = 0.96), t(230) = 0.28, p = .778.
The second t-Test compared the feelings toward lying 
flatism score measured after the writing task. Levene’s 
test was not significant, F(1,230) = 1.00, p = .317. How­
ever, there was a significant difference between the two 
groups, t(230) = -2.11, p = .036, Cohen’s d = 0.28 95% CI 
[0.02, 0.54]. The experimental group (M = 3.15, SD = 0.89) 
reported a higher score than their counterparts in the 
control group (M = 2.88, SD = 0.98).
We also conducted a paired sample t-Test to further 
examine the effectiveness of the essay writing task by 
comparing the pre- and post-measured feelings toward 
lying flatism of the experimental group. Results showed 
a significant difference: t(115) = 4.79, p < .001, d = 0.45 
95% CI [0.25, 0.63]. Specifically, after completing the 
essay writing task, participants reported a higher score 
(M = 3.15, SD = 0.89) than their baseline score (M = 2.83, 
SD = 0.90). The consistent results indicate that the manip­
ulation is effective.
Mediation analysis
The writing task successfully manipulated participants’ 
feelings toward lying flatism. Drawing from the Theory 
of Reasoned Action, the induced feeling is hypothesized 
to have an indirect impact on attitudes toward single­
hood via happiness belief. Before testing the hypothetical 
mediation model, we examined the descriptive statistics 
and correlations for the target variables (see Table 1).
Pearson’s correlation analysis showed that the manip­
ulation of feelings toward lying flatism (dummy coded: 
0 = control group, 1 = experimental group) did not cor­
relate with any of the variables. Happiness belief, on 
the other hand, had a positive relationship with gender 
(dummy coded: 0 = male, 1 = female) and attitudes toward 
singlehood besides a negative relationship with singlism 
and fear of being single. Finally, attitudes toward single­
hood were positively associated with gender and nega­
tively associated with singlism and fear of being single.
Next, we examined the proposed mediation model 
with the group condition (0: control group; 1: experimen­
tal group) as the predictor variable, happiness belief as 
the mediator, and attitudes toward singlehood as the out­
come variable. We included gender, singlism, and fear of 
being single as covariate variables because the three vari­
ables were correlated with happiness belief and attitudes 
toward singlehood respectively.
Table 2 shows the summary of the mediation analysis 
(unstandardized) results. The effect of group conditions 
on happiness belief was not significant. Similarly, group 
conditions did not influence attitudes toward singlehood 
in the total effect model and direct effect model. Hap­
piness belief (B = 0.39, p < .001), on the other hand, was

positively correlated with attitudes toward singlehood. 
Finally, the mediating effect of happiness belief was not 
significant.
Exploratory analysis
The mediation analysis showed that happiness belief 
does not mediate the effect of lying flatism manipula­
tion on attitudes toward singlehood. It was also found 
that the manipulation of feelings toward lying flatism 
did not influence happiness belief and attitudes toward 
singlehood respectively. One possibility is that the effect 
of the manipulation task is too small, and our sample size 
is insufficient to detect its impact. To clarify the relation­
ships between the three variables, we conducted another 
mediation analysis with the feelings toward lying flatism 
measured before the writing manipulation task, which 
represents the participants’ initial feelings toward lying 
flatism, as the predictor. Before that, we conducted a 
Pearson correlation analysis to understand if the pre-
measured feelings toward lying flatism are associated 
with the target and controlled variables. Results showed 
that the pre-measured feelings toward lying flatism had 
a positive relationship with happiness belief (r = .281, 
p < .001) and attitudes toward singlehood (r = .329, 
p < .001), but did not have a relationship with singlism 
and fear of being single, respectively.
Table 3 summarizes the unstandardized results of the 
mediation model. The pre-measured feelings toward 
lying flatism were found to have a positive relationship 
with happiness belief (B = 0.36, p < .001) and attitudes 
toward singlehood in the total effect model (B = 0.30, 
p < .001) and direct effect model (B = 0.17, p < .001). Like­
wise, there was a positive relationship between happiness 
belief and attitudes toward singlehood (B = 0.36, p < .001). 
Finally, the mediating effect of happiness belief was found 
significant: B = 0.13, SE = 0.04, 95% CI [0.06, 0.20].
Discussion
Singlehood is a favorable lifestyle in both Western and 
Asia regions [8, 50]. The present study proposed and 
examined a mediation model to illuminate the relation­
ships among the feelings toward lying flatism, happiness 
belief, and attitudes toward singlehood of young adults 
in Malaysia. Although the hypothetical mediating role

of happiness belief is not supported, several interesting 
findings are revealed.
In contrast to our hypothesis, happiness belief did not 
mediate the impact of feelings toward lying flatism on 
attitudes toward singlehood. Inspection of the results 
found that the manipulation of feelings toward lying 
flatism did not have any impacts on happiness belief and 
attitudes toward singlehood respectively. As mentioned 
above, the results could be attributed to three reasons: (a) 
the manipulation task is not effective, (b) feelings toward 
lying flatism do not have a relationship with the two con­
structs, and (c) the induced effect is too small, and the 
sample size of the current study is insufficient to detect 
the effect. Among them, the third reason seems more 
plausible. This is because our manipulation checking 
indicates that the participants in the experimental group 
reported a higher score in feelings toward lying flatism 
than their counterparts in the control group. Further­
more, the exploratory mediation analysis showed that 
the pre-measured feelings toward lying flatism are posi­
tively associated with both happiness belief and attitudes 
toward singlehood. Taken together, the results imply that 
the writing task is effective to manipulate an individual’s 
feelings toward lying flatism but the induced effect is 
insufficient to influence happiness belief and attitudes 
toward singlehood. Future studies, therefore, are sug­
gested to replicate the present study with a larger sample 
size or another manipulation task.
The (main) mediation analysis also showed a posi­
tive relationship between happiness belief and attitudes 
toward singlehood. It indicates that individuals who 
believe that romantic relationships are not the only way 
to achieve happiness are more likely to perceive staying 
single as advantageous. The finding is in line with the 
findings that single people can still achieve happiness by 
developing their sense of belonging and maintaining low 
levels of loneliness. As a result, they are likely to perceive 
singlehood positively [2, 25]. Likewise, literature shows 
that satisfactions from other fulfilling relationships (e.g., 
supportive family and friends) and important areas of 
life (e.g., work and leisure) are significant factors of hap­
piness [67]. Individuals who enjoy their lives with sup­
portive social ties other than romantic relationships are 
satisfied with singlehood [40].
It is intriguing to note that the exploratory analysis 
(with the feelings toward lying flatism measured before 
the manipulation task as the predictor) supports the 
hypothesized mediation model. The findings offer addi­
tional insights though they shall be interpreted with cau­
tion. First, the positive relationship between the initial 
feelings toward lying flatism and attitudes toward single­
hood indicates that individuals who have positive feelings 
toward lying flatism are more likely to perceive single­
hood as desirable. The result is line with the lying-flat 
view of a romantic relationship (躺平式恋爱观) whereby 
individuals who have positive feelings toward lying 
flatism do not believe in romantic relationships as staying 
single can be less troublesome (e.g., having more freedom 
and control over life) than engaging in romantic relation­
ships or marriage [47]. Similarly, feelings toward lying 
flatism were positively associated with happiness belief, 
suggesting that individuals who have positive feelings 
toward lying flatism are more likely to believe that hap­
piness could be achieved without romantic relationships.

This is in line with past findings (e.g., [43]) that single 
individuals can focus more on themselves instead of their 
romantic partners and that the independence and free­
dom on allocating their resources could result in true 
happiness [68]. Indeed, lying flatists have higher control 
over their life events [20] and this sense of control over 
self is related to happiness [1]. Finally, consistent with the 
Theory of Reasoned Action, our results support feelings 
toward lying flatism (i.e., emotion) having an indirect 
relationship with one’s attitudes toward singlehood (i.e., 
attitudes toward the behavior) via happiness belief (i.e., 
behavioral beliefs). Put differently, individuals who find 
lying flatism attractive tend to believe that happiness can 
be achieved from sources other than romantic relation­
ships. Subsequently, people with high levels of happi­
ness belief are likely to hold a positive manner towards 
singlehood.
Implications
The present study offers suggestions for the theoretical 
development of singlehood. First, we demonstrate that 
the initially measured, but not the manipulated, feel­
ings toward lying flatism, are positively associated with 
attitudes toward singlehood and happiness belief plays 
a mediating role in this relationship. Although these 
exploratory results shall be interpreted with care, the 
findings reveal a possible direction for future research­
ers to unveil the underlying process of lying flatism and 
attitudes toward singlehood. Moreover, the present study 
lends further support to the Theory of Reasoned Action 
and extends it to the context of singlehood.
The present study also has some remarkable practi­
cal implications. First, the present study successfully 
manipulated participants’ feelings toward lying flatism 
using a writing task. The finding not only highlights the 
effectiveness of writing tasks in influencing people’s feel­
ings but also offers a new methodological direction for 
future studies on lying flatism. Furthermore, to our best 
knowledge, our study is the first to examine the roles of 
feelings toward lying flatism and happiness belief in one’s 
attitudes toward singlehood. The findings not only reveal 
new antecedent factors of attitudes toward singlehood on 
top of the literature (e.g., [37]), but also highlight a poten­
tial direction to change one’s attitudes toward single­
hood by modifying feelings toward lying flatism and the 
belief that happiness can be achieved without romantic 
relationships.
Our findings also lend support to the Theory of Rea­
soned Action (TRA) by confirming the role of back­
ground factors and behavioral beliefs in shaping one’s 
attitudes toward a behavior. Furthermore, we elucidate 
the applicability of the theory in the context of single­
hood, indicating its potential for understanding the 
behavior of individuals who choose to remain single.
Limitations and suggestions
Several limitations of the present study deserve our atten­
tion. First, as participants provided personal information 
(e.g., email address) for verification purposes, the present 
study is no longer anonymous. Participants might pro­
vide answers that seem desirable to avoid judgment due 
to the social desirability effect [69]. Second, causal rela­
tionships among the variables remain open. Although 
the writing task is effective to manipulate participants’ 
feelings toward lying flatism, the task does not have any 
impact on happiness beliefs and attitudes toward single­
hood. Likewise, the happiness belief was measured but 
not experimentally manipulated, it is inappropriate to 
interpret the findings with a causality perspective.
Apart from that, the present study only focused on 
single individuals who were currently not in a romantic 
relationship regardless of their voluntary or involuntary 
singlehood status. The findings, therefore, are unable to 
be generalized to people in another relationship status 
(e.g., married, in a romantic relationship, or cohabitat­
ing). With this, we are also unable to examine if there is a 
difference in attitudes toward singlehood when individu­
als from the other relationship status group are having 
positive feelings toward lying flatism, and if the mediat­
ing role of happiness belief still holds among people other 
than single individuals. Finally, feelings toward lying 
flatism and happiness belief were measured by a single 
item, which may be seen as questionable or unreliable 
[70].
To address the above-mentioned limitations, future 
studies are recommended to use longitudinal design and 
procedures that can ensure anonymity. The former can 
furnish a clear picture of the causal relationship between 
the variables, while the latter can offer a sense of safety 
for participants to reveal their truthful responses. More­
over, future researchers are also recommended to expand 
the inclusion criteria to incorporate individuals other 
than those who are currently single and to replicate the 
study in other cultural contexts for examining the effec­
tiveness of the writing task in inducing feelings towards 
lying flatism, as well as the mediating effect of happiness 
belief in the relationship between feelings toward lying 
flatism and attitudes toward singlehood. In terms of mea­
surement, future researchers are urged to either develop 
and employ multi-item measurements or use different 
approaches (e.g., qualitative method) to capture partici­
pants’ feelings toward lying flatism and happiness belief 
levels in verifying the findings of the present study. In 
particular, a more comprehensive measurement of hap­
piness belief is urgently needed to address this issue and 
to clarify the conceptual differences between happiness 
belief and attitudes toward singlehood. Finally, research­
ers are also recommended to use double randomization 
designs [71] (see [72] for example) or half-longitudinal 

Page 10 of 12

mediation model [73] (see [74] for example) to shed 
light on the causal relationship between the three target 
variables.
Conclusion
Lying flatism is a new lifestyle embraced by young people 
to cope with the over-competition of limited resources in 
society [17]. The present study tested a mediation model 
to clarify the relationship between feelings toward lying 
flatism, happiness belief, and attitudes toward singlehood 
among young adults in Malaysia. Our results demon­
strated that young adults who find lying flatism favor­
able tend to believe that happiness can be attained from 
multiple channels other than romantic relationships. 
The happiness belief, in turn, promotes a positive view 
of staying single. The findings indicate that there may be 
a rising trend of young people remaining single in the 
future, potentially due to the growing popularity of the 
lying flatism lifestyle. To address the potential decline in 
marriage and birth rates, it is crucial to provide support 
for the coping mechanisms of the younger generation as 
they navigate the increasing pressures and demands of 
modern life and living conditions.
