Preface to the Second Edition
In this second English edition (third, if one includes the ﬁrst Italian one), a large
number of typos and errors of various kinds have been amended.
I have added more than 100 pages of fresh material, both mathematical and
physical, in particular regarding the notion of superselection rules—addressed from
several different angles—the machinery of von Neumann algebras and the abstract
algebraic formulation. I have considerably expanded the lattice approach to
Quantum Mechanics in Chap. 7, which now contains precise statements leading up
to Solèr’s theorem on the characterization of quantum lattices, as well as gener-
alised versions of Gleason’s theorem. As a matter of fact, Chap. 7 and the related
Chap. 11 have been completely reorganised. I have incorporated a variety of results
on the theory of von Neumann algebras and a broader discussion on the mathe-
matical formulation of superselection rules, also in relation to the von Neumann
algebra of observables. The corresponding preparatory material has been ﬁtted into
Chap. 3. Chapter 12 has been developed further, in order to include technical facts
concerning groups of quantum symmetries and their strongly continuous unitary
representations. I have examined in detail the relationship between Nelson domains
and Gårding domains. Each chapter has been enriched by many new exercises,
remarks, examples and references. I would like once again to thank my colleague
Simon Chiossi for revising and improving my writing.
For having pointed out typos and other errors and for useful discussions, I am

Preface to the First Edition
I must have been 8 or 9 when my father, a man of letters but well-read in every discipline
and with a curious mind, told me this story: “A great scientist named Albert Einstein
discovered that any object with a mass can't travel faster than the speed of light”. To my
bewilderment I replied, boldly: “This can't be true, if I run almost at that speed and then
accelerate a little, surely I will run faster than light, right?” My father was adamant: “No,
it's impossible to do what you say, it's a known physics fact”. After a while I added: “That
bloke, Einstein, must've checked this thing many times … how do you say, he did many
experiments?” The answer I got was utterly unexpected: “Not even one I believe. He used
maths!”
What did numbers and geometrical ﬁgures have to do with the existence of an upper limit to
speed? How could one stand by such an apparently nonsensical statement as the existence
of a maximum speed, although certainly true (I trusted my father), just based on maths?
How could mathematics have such big a control on the real world? And Physics ? What on
earth was it, and what did it have to do with maths? This was one of the most beguiling and
irresistible things I had ever heard till that moment… I had to ﬁnd out more about it.
This is an extended and enhanced version of an existing textbook written in Italian
(and published by Springer-Verlag). That edition and this one are based on a
common part that originated, in preliminary form, when I was a Physics under-
graduate at the University of Genova. The third-year compulsory lecture course
called Theoretical Physics was the second exam that had us pupils seriously
climbing the walls (the ﬁrst being the famous Physics II, covering thermodynamics
and classical electrodynamics).
Quantum Mechanics, taught in Institutions, elicited a novel and involved way of
thinking, a true challenge for craving students: for months we hesitantly faltered on
a hazy and uncertain terrain, not understanding what was really key among the
notions we were trying—struggling, I should say—to learn, together with a com-
pletely new formalism: linear operators on Hilbert spaces. At that time, actually, we
did not realise we were using this mathematical theory, and for many mates of
mine, the matter would have been, rightly perhaps, completely futile; Dirac's bra
vectors were what they were, and that’s it! They were certainly not elements in the
topological dual of the Hilbert space. The notions of Hilbert space and dual
topological space had no right of abode in the mathematical toolbox of the majority
ix

of my fellows, even if they would soon come back in through the back door, with
the course Mathematical Methods of Physics taught by Prof. G. Cassinelli.
Mathematics, and the mathematical formalisation of physics, had always been my
ﬂagship to overcome the difﬁculties that studying physics presented me with, to the
point that eventually (after a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics) I ofﬁcially became a
mathematician. Armed with a maths’ background—learnt in an extracurricular
course of study that I cultivated over the years, in parallel to academic physics—and
eager to broaden my knowledge, I tried to formalise every notion I met in that new
and riveting lecture course. At the same time, I was carrying along a similar project
for the mathematical formalisation of General Relativity, unaware that the work put
into Quantum Mechanics would have been incommensurably bigger.
The formulation of the spectral theorem as it is discussed in x 8, 9 is the same I
learnt when taking the Theoretical Physics exam, which for this reason was a
dialogue of the deaf. Later my interest turned to Quantum Field Theory, a subject I
still work on today, though in the slightly more general framework of QFT in
curved spacetime. Notwithstanding, my fascination with the elementary formula-
tion of Quantum Mechanics never faded over the years, and time and again chunks
were added to the opus I begun writing as a student.
Teaching this material to master’s and doctoral students in mathematics and
physics, thereby inﬂicting on them the result of my efforts to simplify the matter,
has proved to be crucial for improving the text. It forced me to typeset in LaTeX the
pile of loose notes and correct several sections, incorporating many people’s
remarks.
Concerning this, I would like to thank my colleagues, the friends from the
newsgroups it.scienza.ﬁsica, it.scienza.matematica and free.it.scienza.ﬁsica, and the
many students—some of which are now fellows of mine—who contributed to
improve the preparatory material of the treatise, whether directly or not, in the
course of time: S. Albeverio, G. Anzellotti, P. Armani, G. Bramanti, S. Bonaccorsi,
A. Cassa, B. Cocciaro, G. Collini, M. Dalla Brida, S. Doplicher, L. Di Persio,
E. Fabri, C. Fontanari, A. Franceschetti, R. Ghiloni, A. Giacomini, V. Marini,
S. Mazzucchi, E. Pagani, E. Pelizzari, G. Tessaro, M. Toller, L. Tubaro,
D. Pastorello, A. Pugliese, F. Serra Cassano, G. Ziglio and S. Zerbini. I am
indebted, for various reasons also unrelated to the book, to my late colleague
Alberto Tognoli. My greatest appreciation goes to R. Aramini, D. Cadamuro and
C. Dappiaggi, who read various versions of the manuscript and pointed out a
number of mistakes.
I am grateful to my friends and collaborators R. Brunetti, C. Dappiaggi and N.
Pinamonti for lasting technical discussions, for suggestions on many topics covered
in the book and for pointing out primary references.
At last, I would like to thank E. Gregorio for the invaluable and on-the-spot
technical help with the LaTeX package.
In the transition from the original Italian to the expanded English version, a
massive number of (uncountably many!) typos and errors of various kinds have
been corrected. I owe to E. Annigoni, M. Cafﬁni, G. Collini, R. Ghiloni,
A. Iacopetti, M. Oppio and D. Pastorello in this respect. Fresh material was added,
x
Preface to the First Edition

both mathematical and physical, including a chapter, at the end, on the so-called
algebraic formulation.
In particular, Chap. 4 contains the proof of Mercer’s theorem for positive
Hilbert–Schmidt operators. The analysis of the ﬁrst two axioms of Quantum
Mechanics in Chap. 7 has been deepened and now comprises the algebraic char-
acterisation of quantum states in terms of positive functionals with unit norm on the
C-algebra of compact operators. General properties of C-algebras and -morph-
isms are introduced in Chap. 8. As a consequence, the statements of the spectral
theorem and several results on functional calculus underwent a minor but necessary
reshaping in Chaps. 8 and 9. I incorporated in Chap. 10 (Chap. 9 in the ﬁrst edition)
a brief discussion on abstract differential equations in Hilbert spaces. An important
example concerning Bargmann’s theorem was added in Chap. 12 (formerly
Chap. 11). In the same chapter, after introducing the Haar measure, the Peter–Weyl
theorem on unitary representations of compact groups is stated and partially proved.
This is then applied to the theory of the angular momentum. I also thoroughly
examined the superselection rule for the angular momentum. The discussion on
POVMs in Chap.13 (ex Chap. 12) is enriched with further material, and I included a
primer on the fundamental ideas of non-relativistic scattering theory. Bell’s
inequalities (Wigner’s version) are given considerably more space. At the end
of the ﬁrst chapter, basic point-set topology is recalled together with abstract
measure theory. The overall effort has been to create a text as self-contained as
possible. I am aware that the material presented has clear limitations and gaps.
Ironically—my own research activity is devoted to relativistic theories—the entire
treatise unfolds at a non-relativistic level, and the quantum approach to Poincaré’s
symmetry is left behind.
I thank my colleagues F. Serra Cassano, R. Ghiloni, G. Greco, S. Mazzucchi,
A. Perotti and L. Vanzo for useful technical conversations on this second version.
For the same reason, and also for translating this elaborate opus into English,
I would like to thank my colleague S. G. Chiossi.

1.1.1
Scope and Structure
One of the aims of the present book is to explain the mathematical foundations of
Quantum Mechanics (QM), and Quantum Theories in general, in a mathematically
rigorous way. This is a treatise on Mathematics (or Mathematical Physics) rather than
a text on Quantum Mechanics. Except for a few cases, the physical phenomenology
is left in the background in order to privilege the theory’s formal and logical aspects.
At any rate, several examples of the physical formalism are presented, lest one lose
touch with the world of physics.
In alternative to, and irrespective of, the physical content, the book should be
considered as an introductory text, albeit touching upon rather advanced topics, on
functional analysis on Hilbert spaces, including a few elementary yet fundamental
results on C∗-algebras. Special attention is given to a series of results in spectral
theory, such as the various formulations of the spectral theorem for bounded normal
operators and not necessarily bounded, self-adjoint ones. This is, as a matter of fact,
one further scope of the text. The mathematical formulation of Quantum Theories
is “conﬁned” to Chaps.6, 7, 11–13 and partly Chap.14. The remaining chapters are

Introduction and Mathematical Backgrounds
logically independent of those, although the motivations for certain mathematical
deﬁnitions are to be found in Chaps.7, 10–14.
A third purpose is to collect in one place a number of rigorous and useful results on
the mathematical structure of QM and Quantum Theories. These are more advanced
than what is normally encountered in quantum physics’ manuals. Many of these
aspects have been known for a long time but are scattered in the specialistic literature.
We should mention Solèr’s theorem, Gleason’s theorem, the theorem of Kochen and
Specker, the theorems of Stone–von Neumann and Mackey, Stone’s theorem and von
Neumann’s theorem about one-parameter unitary groups, Kadison’s theorem, besides
the better known Wigner, Bargmann and GNS theorems; or, more abstract results in
operator theory such as Fuglede’s theorem, or the polar decomposition for closed
unbounded operators (which is relevant in the Tomita–Takesaki theory and statistical
Quantum Mechanics in relationship to the KMS condition); furthermore, self-adjoint
properties for symmetric operators, due to Nelson, that descend from the existence
of dense sets of analytical vectors, and ﬁnally, Kato’s work (but not only his) on
the essential self-adjointness of certain kinds of operators and their limits from the
bottom of the spectrum (mostly based on the Kato–Rellich theorem).
Some chapters sufﬁce to cover a good part of the material suitable for advanced
courses on Mathematical Methods in Physics; this is common for master’s degrees in
Physics or doctoral degrees, if we assume a certain familiarity with notions, results
and elementary techniques of measure theory. The text may also be used for a higher-
level course in Mathematical Physics that includes foundational material on QM. In
the attempt to reach out to master or Ph.D. students, both in physics with an interest
in mathematical methods or in mathematics with an inclination towards physical
applications, the author has tried to prepare a self-contained text, as far as possi-
ble: hence a primer was included on general topology and abstract measure theory,
together with an appendix on differential geometry. Most chapters are accompanied
by exercises, many of which are solved explicitly.
The book could, ﬁnally, be useful to scholars to organise and present accurately
the profusion of advanced material disseminated in the literature.
Results from topology and measure theory, much needed throughout the whole
treatise, are recalled at the end of this introductory chapter. The rest of the book is
ideally divided into three parts. The ﬁrst part, up to Chap.5, regards the general the-
ory of operators on Hilbert spaces, and introduces several fairly general notions, like
Banach spaces. Core results are proved, such as the theorems of Baire, Hahn–Banach
and Banach–Steinhaus, as well as the ﬁxed-point theorem of Banach–Caccioppoli,
the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem and Fredholm’s alternative, plus some elementary con-
sequences. This part contains a summary of basic topological notions, in the belief
that it might beneﬁt physics’ students. The latter’s training on point-set topology is at
times disparate and often presents gaps, because this subject is, alas, usually taught
sporadically in physics’ curricula, and not learnt in an organic way like students in
mathematics do.
Part two ends with Chap.10. Beside laying out the quantum formalism, it develops
spectral theory, in terms of projector-valued measures, up to the spectral decomposi-
tion theorems for unbounded self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces. This includes

1.1 On the Book
3
the features of maps of operators (functional analysis) for measurable maps that are
not necessarily bounded. General spectral aspects and the properties of their domains
are investigated. A great emphasis is placed onC∗-algebras and the relative functional
calculus, including an elementary study of the Gelfand transform and the commuta-
tive Gelfand–Najmark theorem. The technical results leading to the spectral theorem
are stated and proven in a completely abstract manner in Chap.8, forgetting that the
algebras in question are actually operator algebras, and thus showing their broader
validity. In Chap.10 spectral theory is applied to several practical and completely
abstract contexts, both quantum and not.
Chapter6 treats, from a physical perspective, the motivation underlying the theory.
The general mathematical formulation of QM concerns Chap.7. The mathematical
startingpointistheidea,goingbacktovonNeumann,thatthepropositionsofphysical
quantum systems are described by the lattice of orthogonal projectors on a complex
Hilbert space. Maximal sets of physically compatible propositions (in the quantum
sense) are described by distributive, orthocomplemented, bounded, σ-complete lat-
tices. From this standpoint the quantum deﬁnition of an observable in terms of a
self-adjoint operator is extremely natural, as is, on the other hand, the formulation of
the spectral decomposition theorem. Quantum states are deﬁned as measures on the
lattice of all orthogonal projectors, which is no longer distributive (due to the pres-
ence, in the quantum world, of incompatible propositions and observables). States
are characterised as positive operators of trace class with unit trace under Gleason’s
theorem. Pure states (rays in the Hilbert space of the physical system) arise as extreme
elements of the convex body of states. Generalisations of Gleason’s statement are also
discussed in a more advanced section of Chap.7. The same chapter also discusses
how to recover the Hilbert space starting from the lattice of elementary proposi-
tions, following the theorems of Piron and Solèr. The notion of superselection rule
is also introduced here, and the discussion is expanded in Chap.11 in terms of direct
decomposition of von Neumann factors of observables. In that chapter the notion of
von Neumann algebra of observables is exploited to present the mathematical for-
mulation of quantum theories in more general situations, where not all self-adjoint
operators represent observables.
The third part of the book is devoted to the mathematical axioms of QM, and more
advanced topics like quantum symmetries and the algebraic formulation of quantum
theories. Quantum symmetries and symmetry groups (both according to Wigner and
to Kadison) are studied in depth. Dynamical symmetries and the quantum version of
Noether’s theorem are covered as well. The Galilean group, together with its sub-
groups and central extensions, is employed repeatedly as reference symmetry group,
to explain the theory of projective unitary representations. Bargmann’s theorem on
the existence of unitary representations of simply connected Lie groups whose Lie
algebra obeys a certain cohomology constraint is proved, and Bargmann’s rule of
superselection of the mass is discussed in detail. Then the useful theorems of Gårding
and Nelson for projective unitary representations of Lie groups of symmetries are
considered. Important topics are examined that are often neglected in manuals, like
the uniqueness of unitary representations of the canonical commutation relations
(theorems of Stone–von Neumann and Mackey), or the theoretical difﬁculties in

Introduction and Mathematical Backgrounds
deﬁning time as the conjugate operator to energy (the Hamiltonian). The mathemati-
cal hurdles one must overcome in order to make the statement of Ehrenfest’s theorem
precise are brieﬂy treated. Chapter14 offers an introduction to the ideas and methods
of the abstract formulation of observables and algebraic states via C∗-algebras. Here
one ﬁnds the proof of the GNS theorem and some consequences of purely mathemat-
ical ﬂavour, like the general theorem of Gelfand–Najmark. This closing chapter also
contains material on quantum symmetries in an algebraic setting. As an example the
Weyl C∗-algebra associated to a symplectic space (usually inﬁnite-dimensional) is
presented.
The appendices at the end of the book recap facts on partially ordered sets, groups
and differential geometry.
The author has chosen not to include topics, albeit important, such as the theory
of rigged Hilbert spaces (the famous Gelfand triples) [GeVi64], and the powerful
formulation of QM based on the path integral approach [AH-KM08, Maz09]. Doing
so would have meant adding further preparatory material, in particular regarding
the theory of distributions, and extending measure theory to the inﬁnite-dimensional
case.
There are very valuable and recent textbooks similar to this one, at least in the
mathematical approach. One of the most interesting and useful is the far-reaching
[BEH07].
1.1.2
Prerequisites
Apart from a ﬁrm background on linear algebra, plus some group theory and repre-
sentation theory, essential requisites are the basics of calculus in one and several real
variables, measure theory on σ-algebras [Coh80, Rud86] (summarised at the end of
this chapter), and a few notions on complex functions.
Imperative, on the physics’ side, is the acquaintance with undergraduate physics.
More precisely, analytical mechanics (the groundwork of Hamilton’s formulation of
dynamics) and electromagnetism (the key features of electromagnetic waves and the
crucial wavelike phenomena like interference, diffraction, scattering).
Lesser elementary, yet useful, facts will be recalled where needed (including
examples) to enable a robust understanding. One section of Chap.12 will need ele-
mentary Lie group theory. For this we refer to the book’s epilogue: the last appendix
summarises tidbits of differential geometry rather thoroughly. Further details should
be looked up in [War75, NaSt82].

General Conventions
1. The symbol := means “equal, by deﬁnition, to”.
2. The inclusion symbols ⊂, ⊃allow for equality =.

3. The symbol  denotes the disjoint union.
4. N is the set of natural numbers including zero, and R+ := [0, +∞).
5. Unless otherwise stated, the ﬁeld of scalars of a normed, Banach or Hilbert
vector space is the ﬁeld of complex numbers C, and inner product always means
Hermitian inner product.
6. The complex conjugate of a number c is denoted by c. As the same symbol is
used for the closure of a set of operators, should there be confusion we will
comment on the meaning.
7. The inner product of two vectors ψ, φ in a Hilbert space H is written as (ψ|φ) to
distinguish it from the ordered pair (ψ, φ). The product’s left entry is antilinear:
(αψ|φ) = α(ψ|φ).
If ψ, φ ∈H, the symbols ψ(φ| ) and (φ| )ψ denote the same linear operator
H ∋χ →(φ|χ)ψ.
8. Complete orthonormal systems in Hilbert spaces are called Hilbert bases. When
no confusion arises, a Hilbert basis is simply referred to as a basis.
9. The word operator tacitly implies it is linear.
10. An operator U : H →H′ between Hilbert spaces H and H′ that is isometric and
surjective is called unitary, even if elsewhere in the literature the name is reserved
for the case H = H′.
11. By vector subspace we mean a subspace for the linear operations, even in pres-
ence of additional structures on the ambient space (e.g. Hilbert, Banach etc.).
12. For the Hermitian conjugation we always use the symbol ∗. Note that Hermitian
operator, symmetric operator, and self-adjoint operator are not considered syn-
onyms.
13. When referring to maps, one-to-one, 1–1 and injective mean the same, just
like onto and surjective. Bijective means simultaneously one-to-one and onto,
and invertible is a synonym of bijective. One should beware that a one-to-one
correspondence is a bijective mapping. An isomorphism, irrespective of the
algebraic structures at stake, is a 1–1 map onto its image, hence a bijective
homomorphism.
14. Boldface typeset (within a deﬁnition or elsewhere) is typically used when deﬁn-
ing a term for the ﬁrst time.
15. Corollaries, deﬁnitions, examples, lemmas, notations, remarks, propositions and
theorems are labelled sequentially to simplify lookup.
16. At times we use the shorthand ‘iff’, instead of ‘if and only if’, to say that two
statements imply one another, i.e. they are logically equivalent.
Finally, if h denotes Planck’s constant, we adopt the notation, widely used by physi-
cists,
ℏ:= h
2π = 1.054571800(13) × 10−34 Js .

Introduction and Mathematical Backgrounds
1.2
On Quantum Theories
1.2.1
Quantum Mechanics as a Mathematical Theory
From a mathematical point of view Quantum Mechanics represents a rare blend of
mathematical elegance and descriptive insight into the physical world. The theory
essentially makes use of techniques of functional analysis mixed with incursions and
overlaps with measure theory, probability and mathematical logic.
There are (at least) two possible ways to formulate precisely (i.e. mathemati-
cally) elementary QM. The eldest one, historically speaking, is due to von Neumann
([Neu32]) in essence, and is formulated using the language of Hilbert spaces and the
spectral theory of unbounded operators. A more recent and mature formulation was
developed by several authors in the attempt to solve quantum ﬁeld theory problems in
mathematical physics. It relies on the theory of abstract algebras (∗-algebras and C∗-
algebras) that are built mimicking the operator algebras deﬁned and studied, again,
by von Neumann (nowadays known as W ∗-algebras or von Neumann algebras), but
freed from the Hilbert-space structure (for instance, [BrRo02] is a classic on operator
algebras). The core result is the celebrated GNS theorem (after Gelfand, Najmark
and Segal) [Haa96, BrRo02], that we will prove in Chap.14. The newer formulation
can be considered an extension of the former one, in a very precise sense that we
shall not go into here, also by virtue of the novel physical context it introduces and by
the possibility of treating physical systems with inﬁnitely many degrees of freedom,
i.e. quantum ﬁelds. In particular, this second formulation makes precise sense of the
demand for locality and covariance of relativistic quantum ﬁeld theories [Haa96],
and allows to extend quantum ﬁeld theories to a curved spacetime.
The algebraic formulation of elementary QM, even though it can be achieved
and despite its utmost ﬁnesse, is not a strict necessity (see for example [Str05a]
and parts of [DA10]). Given the relatively basic nature of our book we shall treat
almost exclusively the ﬁrst formulation, which displays an impressive mathematical
complexity together with a manifest formal elegance. We will introduce the algebraic
formulation in the last chapter only, and stay within the general framework rather
than consider QM as a physical object.
A crucial mathematical tool to develop a Hilbert-space formulation for QM is the
spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators (unbounded, usually) deﬁned on dense
subspaces of a Hilbert space. This theorem, which can be extended to normal oper-
ators, was ﬁrst proved by von Neumann in [Neu32] apropos the mathematical struc-
ture of QM: this fundamental work ought to be considered a XX century milestone
of mathematical physics and pure mathematics. The deﬁnition of abstract Hilbert
spaces and much of the corresponding theory, as we know it today, are also due to
von Neumann and his formalisation of QM. Von Neumann built the modern,
axiomatic notion of an abstract Hilbert space [Neu32, Sect.1] by considering the
two approaches to QM known at that time: the one relying on Heisenberg matrices,
and the one using Schrödinger’s wavefunctions.

1.2 On Quantum Theories
7
The relationship between QM and spectral theory depends upon the following
fact. The standard way of interpreting QM dictates that physical quantities that are
measurable over quantum systems can be associated to unbounded self-adjoint oper-
ators on a suitable Hilbert space. The spectrum of each operator coincides with the
collection of values the associated physical quantity can attain. The construction of
a physical quantity from easy properties and propositions of the type “the value of
the quantity falls in the interval (a, b]”, which correspond to orthogonal projectors
in the mathematical scheme one adopts, is nothing else but an integration proce-
dure with respect to an appropriate projector-valued spectral measure. In practice,
then, the spectral theorem is just a means to construct complicated operators starting
from projectors or, conversely, decompose operators in terms of projector-valued
measures.
The contemporary formulation of spectral theory is certainly different from that
of von Neumann, although the latter already contained all basic constituents. Von
Neumann’s treatise (dating back to 1932) discloses an impressive depth still today,
especially in the most difﬁcult parts of the physical interpretation of the QM formal-
ism. If we read that book it becomes clear that von Neumann was well aware of these
issues, as opposed to many colleagues of his. It would be interesting to juxtapose his
opus to the much more renowned book by Dirac [Dir30] on QM’s fundamentals, a
comparison that we leave to the interested reader. At any rate, the great interpretative
strength von Neumann gave to QM begins to be recognised by experimental physi-
cists as well, in particular those concerned with quantum measurements [BrKh95].
The so-called quantum logics arise from the attempt to formalise QM from the
most radical stand: endowing the same logic used to treat quantum systems with
properties different from those of ordinary logic, and modifying the semantic theory.
For example, more than two truth values are allowed, and the Boolean lattice of
propositions is replaced by a more complicated non-distributive structure. In the ﬁrst
formulation of quantum logic, known as standard quantum logic and introduced by
Von Neumann and Birkhoff in 1936, the role of the Boolean algebra of propositions
is taken by an orthomodular lattice: this is modelled, as a matter of fact, on the set of
orthogonal projectors on a Hilbert space, or the collection of closed projection spaces
[Bon97],plussomecompositionrules.Despiteitssophistication,thatmodelisknown
to contain many ﬂaws when one tries to translate it in concrete (operational) physical
terms. Beside the various formulations of quantum logic [Bon97, DCGi02, EGL09],
there are also other foundational formulations based on alternative viewpoints (e.g.,
topos theory).
1.2.2
QM in the Panorama of Contemporary Physics
Quantum Mechanics and General and Special Relativity (GSR) represent the two
paradigms by which the physics of the XX and XXI centuries developed. QM is,
roughly speaking, the physical theory of the atomic and sub-atomic world, while GSR
is the physical theory of gravity, the macroscopic world and cosmology (as recently

8
1
Introduction and Mathematical Backgrounds
as 2016, GSR received thunderous experimental conﬁrmation with the detection of
gravitational waves). These two paradigms coalesced, in several contexts, to give
rise to relativistic quantum theories. Relativistic Quantum Field Theory [StWi00,
Wei99], in particular, has witnessed a striking growth and a spectacular predictive and
explanatory success relative to the theory of elementary particles and fundamental
interactions. Two examples for all. In the so-called standard model of elementary
particles, that theory predicted the uniﬁcation of the weak and electromagnetic forces
which was conﬁrmed experimentally at the end of the 1980s during a memorable
experiment at C.E.R.N., in Geneva, where the particles Z0 and W ±, expected by
electro-weak uniﬁcation, were ﬁrst observed. More recently, another prediction was
conﬁrmed:theexistenceoftheHiggsboson,suspectedsincethe1960sandeventually
detected 50 years after. On March 14, 2013, referring to the newly observed particle,
C.E.R.N. conﬁrmed that: ‘CMS and ATLAS have compared a number of options for
the spin-parity of this particle, and these all prefer no spin and even parity. This,
coupled with the measurements of the interactions with other particles, strongly
indicates that the new particle is a Higgs boson.’
The best-ever accuracy in the measurement of a physical quantity in the whole
history of physics was predicted by quantum electrodynamics. The quantity is the
so-called gyro-magnetic ratio g of the electron, a dimensionless number. The value
expected by quantum electrodynamics for a := g/2 −1 was
0.001159652359 ± 0.000000000282 ,
and the experimental result turned out to be
0.001159652209 ± 0.000000000031 .
Many physicists believe QM to be the fundamental theory of the universe (more than
relativistic theories), also owing to the impressive range of linear scales at which it
holds: from 1m (Bose–Einstein condensates) to at least 10−16 m (inside nucleons, at
quark level). QM has had an enormous success, both theoretical and experimental,
in materials’ science, optics, electronics, with several key repercussions: every tech-
nological object of common use that is complex enough to contain a semiconductor
(childrens’ toys, mobile phones, remote controls…) exploits the quantum properties
of matter.
Going back to the two major approaches of the past century – QM and GSR – there
remainanumberofobscurepointswheretheseparadigmsseemtoclash.Inparticular,
the so-called “quantisation of gravity” and the structure of spacetime at Planck scales
(∼10−35 m, ∼10−43 s, the length and time scales obtained from the fundamental
constants of the two theories: the speed of light, the universal constant of gravity and
Planck’s constant). The necessity of a discontinuous spacetime at ultra-microscopic
scales is also reinforced by certain mathematical (and conceptual) hurdles that the so-
called theory of quantum Renormalisation has yet to overcome, as consequence of the
inﬁnite values arising in computing processes due to the interaction of elementary
particles. From a purely mathematical perspective the existence of inﬁnite values

is actually related to the problem, already intrinsically ambiguous, of deﬁning the
product of two distributions: inﬁnites are not the root of the problem, but a mere
manifestation of it.
These issues, whether unsolved or partially solved, have underpinned important
theoretical advancements of late, which in turn inﬂuenced the developments of pure
mathematics itself. Examples include (super-)String theory, the various Noncommu-
tative Geometries, ﬁrst of all Alain Connes’ version, and Loop Quantum Gravity.
The difﬁculty in deciding which of these theories makes any physical sense and is
apt to describe the universe at very small scales is also practical: today’s technology
is not capable of preparing experiments that enable to distinguish among all avail-
able theories. However, it is relevant to note that recent experimental observations
of the so-called γ -bursts, conducted with the telescope “Fermi Gamma-ray”, have
lowered the threshold for detecting quantum-gravity phenomena (e.g. the violation
of Lorentz’s symmetry) well below Planck’s length [Abd09]. Other discrepancies
between QM and GSR, about which the debate is more relaxed today than it was
in the past, have to do with QM verses the notions of locality of relativistic nature
(Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox [Bon97]) in relationship to QM’s entanglement
phenomena.ThisisdueinparticulartoBell’sworkinthelate1960s,andtothefamous
experiments of Aspect. Both disproved Einstein’s expectations, and secondly they
conﬁrmed the Copenhagen interpretation, eventually proving that nonlocality is a
characteristic of Nature, independent of whether one accepts the standard interpre-
tation of QM or not. The vast majority of physicists seems to agree that the existence
of nonlocal physical processes, as QM forecasts, does not imply any concrete viola-
tion of the core of Relativity (quantum entanglement does not involve superluminal
transmission of information, nor the violation of causality [Bon97]).
In the standard interpretation of QM that is called the Copenhagen interpretation
there are parts that remain physically and mathematically unintelligible, yet still
very interesting conceptually. In particular, and despite several appealing attempts,
it still not clear how standard mechanics may be seen as a limit subcase of QM,
nor how to demarcate (even roughly, or temporarily) the two worlds. Further, the
question remains about the physical and mathematical description of the so-called
process of quantum measurement, of which more later, which is strictly related to
the classical limit of QM. From this fact, as well, other interpretations of the QM
formalisms were born that differ deeply from the Copenhagen interpretation. Among
these more recent interpretations, once considered heresies, Bohm’s interpretation
relies on hidden variables [Bon97, Des99] and is particularly intriguing.
Doubts are sometimes raised about the formulation of QM and about it being not
truly clear, but just a list of procedures that “actually work”, whereas its true nature is
something inaccessible, sort of “noetic”. In the author’s opinion a dangerous episte-
mological mistake hides behind this point of view. The misconception is based on the
belief that “explaining” a phenomenon means reducing it to the categories of daily
life, as if everyday experience reached farther than reality itself. Quite the contrary:
those categories were built upon conventional wisdom, and hence without any alleged
metaphysical insight. There could be a deep philosophical landscape unfolding on
the other side of that simple “actually works”, and it may draw us closer to reality

Introduction and Mathematical Backgrounds
rather than pushing us away from it. Quantum Mechanics has taught us to think in
a different fashion, and for this reason it has been (is, actually) an incredible oppor-
tunity for humanity. To turn our backs on QM and declare we do not understand it
because it refuses to beﬁt our familiar mental categories means locking the door that
separates us from something huge. This is the author’s stance, who does indeed con-
sider Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (a theorem in today’s formulation, despite
the name) one of the highest achievements of the human enterprise.
Mathematics is the most accurate of languages invented by man. It allows to
create formal structures corresponding to worlds that may or may not exist. The
plausibility of these hypothetical realities is found solely in the logical or syntac-
tical coherence of the corresponding mathematical structure. In this way semantic
“chimeras” might arise, that turn out to be syntactically coherent nevertheless. Some-
times these creatures are consistent with worlds or states that do exist, although they
have not been discovered yet. A feature that is attributable to an existing entity can
only either be present or not, according to the classical ontological view. Quantum
Mechanics, in particular, leads to say that any such property may not simply obey
the true/false pattern, but also be “uncertain”, despite being inherent to the object
itself. This tremendous philosophical leap can be entirely managed within the math-
ematical foundations of QM, and represents the most profound philosophical legacy
of Heisenberg’s principle.
At least two general issues remain unanswered, both of gnoseological nature,
essentially, and common to the entire formulation of modern science. The ﬁrst is
the relationship between theoretical entities and the objects we have experience of.
The problem is particularly delicate in QM, where the notion of what a measuring
instrument is has not yet been fully clariﬁed. Generally speaking, the relationship of
a theoretical entity with an experimental object is not direct, and still based on often
understated theoretical assumptions. But this is also the case in classical theories,
when one, for example, wants to tackle problems such as the geometry of the phys-
ical space. There, it is necessary to identify, inside the physical reality, objects that
correspond to the idea of a point, a segment, and so on, and to do that we use other
assumptions, like the fact that the geometry of the straightedge is the same as when
inspecting space with light beams. The second issue is the hopelessness of trying to
prove the syntactic coherence of a mathematical construction. We may attempt to
reduce the latter to the coherence of set theory, or category theory. That this reduc-
tion should prove the construction’s solidity has more to do with psychology than
with it being a real fact, due to the profusion of well-known paradoxes disseminated
along the history of the formalisation of mathematics, and eventually due to Gödel’s
famous theorem.
In spite of all, QM (but also other scientiﬁc theories) has been – and is – capable
of predicting new facts and not yet observed phenomena that have been conﬁrmed
experimentally.
In this sense Quantum Mechanics must contain elements of reality.

Backgrounds on General Topology
For the reader’s sake we collect here notions of point-set topology that will be used
by and large in the book. All statements are elementary and classical, and can be
found easily in any university treatise, so for brevity we will prove almost nothing.
The practiced reader may skip this section completely and return to it at subsequent
stages for reference.
1.3.1
Open/Closed Sets and Basic Point-Set Topology
Open and closed sets are deﬁned as follows [Ser94II], in the greatest generality.
Deﬁnition 1.1 The pair (X, T ), where X is a set and T a collection of subsets of
X, is called a topological space if:
(i) ∅, X ∈T ,
(ii) the union of (arbitrarily many) elements of T is an element of T ,
(iii) the intersection of a ﬁnite number of elements of T belongs to T .
T is called a topology on X and the elements of T are the open sets of X.
Deﬁnition 1.2 On a topological space (X, T ):
(a) a basis for the topology of (X, T ) is a subset B ⊂T such that each element in
T is the union of elements of B;
(b) an open neighbourhood of p ∈X is an element A ∈T such that p ∈A;
(c) x ∈S ⊂X is an interior point of S if there exists an open neighbourhood A of
x contained in S.
The interior of a set S ⊂X is the set:
Int(S) := {x ∈X | x is an interior point of S} .
The exterior of a set S ⊂X is the set:
Ext(S) := {x ∈X | x is an interior point of X \ S} .
The frontier of a set S ⊂X is the difference set:
∂S := X \ (Int(S) ∪Ext(S)) .
(d) C ⊂X is called closed if X \ C is open.
A subset S ⊂X in a topological space (X, T ) inherits the structure of a topological
space from (X, T ) by deﬁning a topology on S as TS := {S ∩A | A ∈T }. This
topology (the deﬁnition is easily satisﬁed) is called the induced topology on S by
(X, T ).

Introduction and Mathematical Backgrounds
Most of the topological spaces we will see in this text are Hausdorff spaces, in which
open sets “separate” points.
Deﬁnition 1.3 A topological space (X, T ) and its topology are called Hausdorff
if they satisfy the Hausdorff property: for every x, x′ ∈X there exist A, A′ ∈T ,
with x ∈A, x′ ∈A′, such that A ∩A′ = ∅.
Remark 1.4 (1) Both X and ∅are open and closed sets.
(2) Closed sets satisfy properties that are “dual” to open sets, as follows straightfor-
wardly from their deﬁnition. Hence:
(i) ∅, X are closed,
(ii) the intersection of (arbitrarily many) closed sets is closed,
(iii) the ﬁnite union of closed sets is a closed set.
(3) The simplest example of a Hausdorff topology is the collection of subsets of R
containing the empty set and arbitrary unions of open intervals. This is a basis for
the topology in the sense of Deﬁnition1.1. It is called the Euclidean topology or
standard topology of R.
(4) A slightly more complicated example of Hausdorff topology is the Euclidean
topology, or standard topology, of Rn and Cn. It is the usual topology one refers to
in elementary calculus, and is built as follows. If K := R or C, the standard norm
of (c1, . . . , cn) ∈Kn is, by deﬁnition:
||(c1, . . . , cn)|| :=




n

k=1
|ck|2 ,
(c1, . . . , cn) ∈Kn .
(1.1)
The set:
Bδ(x0) := {x ∈Kn | ||x −x0|| < δ}
(1.2)
is, hence, the usual open ball of Kn of radius δ > 0 and centre x0 ∈Kn. The open
sets in the standard topology of Kn are, empty set aside, the unions of open balls of
any given radius and centre. These balls constitute a basis for the standard topology
of Rn and Cn.
■
Here are notions that will come up often in the sequel.
Deﬁnition 1.5 If (X, T ) is a topological space, the closure of S ⊂X is the set:
S := ∩{C ⊃S , C ⊂X | C is closed} .
(1.3)
The subset S is called dense in X if S = X.
The space (X, T ) is said to be separable if there exists a dense and countable subset
S ⊂X.
From the deﬁnition these properties follow.

1.3 Backgrounds on General Topology

Proposition 1.6 If (X, T ) is a topological space and S ⊂X:
(a) S is closed.
(b) S = S.
(c) If T ⊂X, then S ⊂T implies S ⊂T .
(d) S is closed if and only if S = S.
Deﬁnition 1.7 A topological space (X, T ) has a countable basis, or is second-
countable, if there is a countable subset T0 ⊂T (the “countable basis”) such that
every open set is the union of elements of T0.
If (X, T ) has a countable basis then Lindelöf’s lemma holds:
Theorem 1.8 (Lindelöf’s lemma) Let (X, T ) be a second-countable topological
space. Then any open covering of a given subset in X admits a countable sub-
covering: if B ⊂X and {Ai}i∈I ⊂T with ∪i∈I Ai ⊃B, then ∪i∈J Ai ⊃B for some
countable subset J ⊂I.
Remark 1.9 Rn and Cn, equipped with the standard topology, are second-countable:
for Rn, T0 can be taken to be the collection of open balls with rational radii and
centred at rational points. The generalisation to Cn is obvious.
■
In conclusion, we recall the deﬁnition of product topology.
Deﬁnition 1.10 If {(Xi, Ti)}i∈F is a collection of topological spaces indexed by a
ﬁnite set F, the product topology on ×i∈FXi is the topology whose open sets are ∅
and the unions of Cartesian products ×i∈F Ai, with Ai ∈Ti for any i ∈F.
If F has arbitrary cardinality, the previous deﬁnition cannot be generalised directly.
If we did so in the obvious way we would not maintain important properties, such
as Tychonoff’s theorem, that we will discuss later. Nevertheless, a natural topol-
ogy on ×i∈FXi can be deﬁned, still called product topology because is extends
Deﬁnition1.10.
Deﬁnition 1.11 If {(Xi, Ti)}i∈F is a collection of topological spaces with F of arbi-
trary cardinality, the product topology on ×i∈FXi has as open sets ∅and the unions
of Cartesian products ×i∈F Ai, with Ai ∈Ti for any i ∈F, such that on each ×i∈F Ai
we have Ai = Xi but for a ﬁnite number of indices i.
Remark 1.12 (1) The standard topology of Rn is the product topology obtained by
endowing the single factors R with the standard topology. The same happens for Cn.
(2) Either in case of ﬁnitely many factors, or inﬁnitely many, the canonical projec-
tions:
πi : × j∈FX j ∋{x j} →xi ∈Xi
are clearly continuous if we put the product topology on the domain. It can be proved
that the product topology is the coarsest among all topologies making the canonical
projections continuous (coarsest means it is contained in any such topology).

1.3.2
Convergence and Continuity
Let us pass to convergence and continuity. First of all we need to recall the notions
of convergence of a sequence and limit point.
Deﬁnition 1.13 Let (X, T ) be a topological space.
(a) A sequence {xn}n∈N ⊂X converges to a point x ∈X, called the limit of the
sequence:
x =
lim
n→+∞xn
and also written
xn →x
as n →+∞
if, for any open neighbourhood A of x there exists NA ∈R such that xn ∈A whenever
n > NA.
(b) x ∈X is a limit point of a subset S ⊂X if any open neighbourhood A of x
contains a point of S \ {x}.
Remark 1.14 It should be patent from the deﬁnitions that in a Hausdorff space the
limit of a sequence is unique, if it exists.
■
The relationship between limit points and closure of a set is sanctioned by the fol-
lowing classical and elementary result:
Proposition 1.15 Let (X, T ) be a topological space and S ⊂X.
S coincides with the union of S and the set of its limit points.
The deﬁnition of continuity and continuity at a point is recalled below.
Deﬁnition 1.16 Let f : X →X′ be a function between topological spaces (X, T ),
(X′, T ′).
(a) f is called continuous if f −1(A′) ∈T for any A′ ∈T ′.
(b) f is said continuous at p ∈X if, for any open neighbourhood A′
f (p) of f (p),
there is an open neighbourhood Ap of p such that f (Ap) ⊂A′
f (p).
(c) f is called a homeomorphism if:
(i)
f is continuous,
(ii)
f is bijective,
(iii)
f −1 : X′ →X is continuous.
In this case X and X′ are said to be homeomorphic (under f ).
(d) f is called open (respectively closed) if f (A) ∈T ′ for A ∈T (resp. X′ \
f (C) ∈T ′ for X \ C ∈T ).
Remark 1.17 (1) It is easy to check that f : X →X′ is continuous if and only if it
is continuous at every point p ∈X.
(2) The notion of continuity at p as of (b) reduces to the more familiar “ϵ-δ” deﬁnition
when the spaces X and X′ are Rn (or Cn) with the standard topology. To see this bear
in mind that: (a) open neighbourhoods can always be chosen to be open balls of radii
δ and ϵ, centred at p and f (p) respectively; (b) every open neighbourhood of a point
contains an open ball centred at that point.

1.3 Backgrounds on General Topology
15
Let us mention a useful result concerning the standard real line R. One deﬁnes the
limit supremum (also superior limit, or simply limsup) and the limit inﬁmum
(inferior limit or just liminf) of a sequence {sn}n∈N ⊂R as follows:
lim sup
n∈N
sn := inf
k∈N sup
n≥k
sn

=
lim
k→+∞sup
n≥k
sn

,
lim inf
n∈N sn := sup
k∈N
inf
n≥k sn
	
=
lim
k→+∞inf
n≥k sn

.
Note how these numbers exist for any given sequence {sn}n∈N ⊂R, possibly being
inﬁnite, as they arise as limits of monotone sequences, whereas the limit of {sn}n∈N
might not exist (neither ﬁnite nor inﬁnite). However, it is not hard to prove the
following elementary fact.
Proposition 1.18 If {sn}n∈N ⊂R, then limn→+∞sn exists, possibly inﬁnite, if and
only if
lim sup
n∈N
sn = lim inf
n∈N
sn .
In such a case:
lim
n→+∞sn = lim sup
n∈N
sn = lim inf
n∈N
sn .
1.3.3
Compactness
Let us brieﬂy recall some easy facts about compact sets.
Deﬁnition 1.19 Let (X, T ) be a topological space and K ⊂X a subset.
(a) K is called compact if any open covering of it admits a ﬁnite sub-covering: if
{Ai}i∈I ⊂T with ∪i∈I Ai ⊃K then ∪i∈J Ai ⊃K for some ﬁnite subset J ⊂I.
(b) K is said relatively compact if K is compact.
(c) X is locally compact if any point in X has a relatively compact open neighbour-
hood.
Compact sets satisfy a host of properties [Ser94II] and we will not be concerned
with them much more (though we shall return to them in Chap.4). Let us recall a
few results, at any rate.
We begin with the relationship to calculus on Rn. If X is Rn (or Cn identiﬁed with
R2n), the celebrated Heine–Borel theorem holds [Ser94II].
Theorem 1.20 (Heine–Borel) If Rn is equipped with the standard topology, K ⊂
Rn is compact if and only if K is simultaneously closed and bounded (meaning
K ⊂Bδ(x) for some x ∈Rn, δ > 0).
In calculus, the Weierstrass theorem, which deals with continuous maps deﬁned
on compact subsets of Rn (or Cn), can be proved directly without the deﬁnition
of compactness. Actually one can prove a more general statement on Rn-valued
(Cn-valued) continuous maps deﬁned on compact subsets.

Introduction and Mathematical Backgrounds
Proposition 1.21 If K = C or R, let || || denote the standard norm of Kn as in (1.1),
and endow Kn with the standard topology.
If f : K →Kn is continuous on the compact subset K of a topological space, then
it is bounded, i.e. there exists M ∈R such that || f (x)|| ≤M for any x ∈K.
Proof Since f is continuous at any point p ∈K, we have || f (x)|| ≤Mp ∈R for
all x in an open neighbourhood Ap of p. As K is compact, we may extract a
ﬁnite sub-covering {Apk}k=1,...,N from {Ap}p∈K that covers K. The number M :=
maxk=1,...,N Mk satisﬁes the request.
□
Remark 1.22 (1) It is easily proved that if X is a Hausdorff space and K ⊂X is
compact then K is closed.
(2) Similarly, if K is compact in X, then every closed subset K ′ ⊂K is compact.
(3) Continuous functions map compact sets to compact sets.
(4) By deﬁnition of compactness and of induced topology it is clear that a set K ⊂Y,
with the induced topology on Y ⊂X, is compact in Y if and only if it is compact in
X.
■
The properties of being compact and Hausdorff bear an interesting relationship. One
such property is expressed by the following useful statement.
Proposition 1.23 Let f : M →N be a continuous map from the compact space M
to the Hausdorff space N. If f is bijective then it is a homeomorphism.
On locally compact Hausdorff spaces an important technical result, known as Ury-
sohn’s lemma, holds. To state it, we ﬁrst need to deﬁne the support of a map
f : X →C:
supp( f ) := {x ∈X | f (x) ̸= 0} ,
where the bar is the topological closure in the space X.
Theorem 1.24 (Urysohn’s lemma) If (X, T ) is a Hausdorff, locally compact space,
for any compact K ⊂X and any open set U ⊃K there exists a continuous map
f : X →[0, 1] such that:
(i) supp( f ) ⊂U,
(ii) supp( f ) is compact,
(iii) f (x) = 1 if x ∈K.
Eventually, the following key theorem relates the product topology to compactness.
Theorem 1.25 (Tychonoff) The Cartesian product of (arbitrarily many) compact
spaces is compact in the product topology.
1.3.4
Connectedness
Deﬁnition 1.26 A topological space X is said to be connected if it cannot be written
as the union of two disjoint open sets different from ∅and X.
A subset A ⊂X is connected if it is connected in the induced topology.

1.3 Backgrounds on General Topology
17
By deﬁning the equivalence relation:
x ∼x′ ⇔x, x′ ∈C, where C is a connected set in X,
the resulting equivalence classes are maximal connected subsets in X called the
connected components of X. Consequently, connected components are disjoint,
cover X and are clearly closed.
Deﬁnition 1.27 A subset A in a topological space X is path-connected if for any
pair of points p, q ∈A there is a continuous map (a path) γ : [0, 1] →A such that
γ (0) = p, γ (1) = q.
Deﬁnition 1.28 A subset A in a topological space X is called simply connected
if, for any p, q ∈A and any (continuous) paths γi : [0, 1] →A, i = 0, 1, such that
γi(0) = p, γi(1) = q, there exists a continuous map γ : [0, 1] × [0, 1] →A, called a
homotopy, satisfying γ (s, 0) = p, γ (s, 1) = q for all s ∈[0, 1] and γ (0, t) = γ0(t),
γ (1, t) = γ1(t) for all t ∈[0, 1].
Remark 1.29 (1) Directly from the deﬁnition we have that continuous functions map
connected spaces to connected spaces and path-connected spaces to path-connected
spaces.
(2) A path-connected space is connected, but not conversely in general. A non-empty,
open connected subset of Rn is always path-connected. This is a general property that
holds in locally path-connected spaces, in which each point has a path-connected
open neighbourhood.
(3) It can be proved that the product of two simply connected spaces, if equipped
with the product topology, is simply connected.

Round-Up on Measure Theory
This section contains, for the reader’s sake, basic notions and elementary results on
abstract measure theory, plus fundamental facts from real analysis on Lebesgue’s
measure on the real line. To keep the treatise short we will not prove any statements,
for these can be found in the classics [Hal69, Coh80, Rud86]. Well-read users might
want to skip this part entirely, and refer to it for explanations on the conventions and
notations used throughout.
1.4.1
Measure Spaces
The modern theory of integration is rooted in the notion of a σ-algebra of sets: this
is a collection (X) of subsets of a given ‘universe’ set X that can be “measured”
by an arbitrary “measuring” function μ that we will ﬁx later. The deﬁnition of a
σ-algebra speciﬁes which are the good properties that subsets should possess in
relationship to the operations of union and intersection. The “σ” in the name points

18

Introduction and Mathematical Backgrounds
to the closure property (Deﬁnition1.30(c)) of (X) under countable unions. The
integral of a function deﬁned on X with respect to a measure μ on the σ-algebra will
be built step by step.
We begin by deﬁning σ-algebras, and a weaker version (algebras of sets) where
unions are allowed only ﬁnite cardinality, which has an interest of its own.
Deﬁnition 1.30 A σ-algebra over the set X is a collection (X) of subsets of X
such that:
(a) X ∈(X),
(b) E ∈(X) implies X \ E ∈(X),
(c) if {Ek}k∈N ⊂(X) then 
k∈N Ek ∈(X).
A measurable space is a pair (X, (X)), where X is a set and (X) a σ-algebra on
X.
A collection 0(X) of subsets of X is called an algebra (of sets) on X in case (a),
(b) hold (replacing (X) by 0(X)), and (c) is weakened to:
(c)’ if {Ek}k∈F ⊂0(X), with F ﬁnite, then 
k∈F Ek ∈0(X).
Remark 1.31 (1) From (a) and (b) it follows that ∅∈(X). Item (c) includes ﬁnite
unions in (X): a σ-algebra is an algebra of sets. This is a consequence of (c) if one
takes ﬁnitely many distinct Ek. Parts (b) and (c) imply (X) is also closed under
intersections (at most countable).
(2) By deﬁnition of σ-algebra it follows that the intersection of σ-algebras on X is a
σ-algebra on X. Moreover, the collection of all subsets of X is a σ-algebra on X. ■
Remark (2) prompts us to introduce a relevant technical notion. If A is a collection
of subsets in X, there always is at least one σ-algebra containing all elements of A .
Since the intersection of all σ-algebras on X containing A is still a σ-algebra, the
latter is well deﬁned and called the σ-algebra generated by A .-algebra generated by
A Now let us deﬁne a notion, crucial for our purposes, where topology and measure
theory merge.
Deﬁnition 1.32 If X is a topological space with topology T , the σ-algebra on X
generated by T , denoted B(X), is called Borel σ-algebra on X.
Remark 1.33 (1) The notation B(X) is slightly ambiguous since T does not appear.
We shall use that symbol anyway, unless confusion arises.
(2) If X coincides with R or C we shall assume in the sequel that (X) is the Borel
σ-algebra B(X) determined by the standard topology on X (that of R2 if we are
talking of C).
(3) By deﬁnition of σ-algebra it follows immediately that B(X) contains in particular
open and closed subsets, intersections of (at most countably many) open sets and
unions of (at most countably many) closed sets.
■
The mathematical concept we are about to present is that of a measurable function.
In a manner of speaking, this notion corresponds to that of a continuous function
in topology.

1.4 Round-Up on Measure Theory
19
Deﬁnition 1.34 Let (X, (X)), (Y, (Y)) be measurable spaces. A function f :
X →Y is said to be measurable (with respect to the two σ-algebras) whenever
f −1(E) ∈(X) for any E ∈(Y).
In particular, if X is a topological space and we take (X) = B(X), and Y = R
or C, measurable functions from X to Y are called (Borel) measurable functions,
respectively real or complex.
Remark 1.35 Let X and Y be topological spaces with topologies T (X) and T (Y).
It is easily proved that f : X →Y is measurable with respect to the Borel σ-algebras
B(X), B(Y) if and only if f −1(E) ∈B(X) for any E ∈T (Y).
Immediately, then, every continuous map f : X →C or f : X →R is Borel mea-
surable.
Let us summarise the main features of measurable maps from X to Y = R, C.
Proposition 1.36 Let (X, (X)) be a measurable space and MR(X), M(X) the sets
of measurable maps from X to R, C respectively. The following results hold.
(a) MR(X) and M(X) are vector spaces, respectively real and complex, with
respect to pointwise linear combinations
(αf + βg)(x) := αf (x) + βg(x),
x ∈X,
for any measurable maps f, g from X to R, C and any real or complex numbers α, β.
(b) If f, g ∈MR(X), M(X) then f · g ∈MR(X), M(X), with ( f · g)(x) :=
f (x)g(x) for all x ∈X.
(c) The following facts are equivalent:
(i) f ∈M(X),
(ii) f ∈M(X),
(iii) Re f, Im f ∈MR(X),
where f (x) := f (x), (Re f )(x) := Re( f (x)), and (Im f )(x) := Im( f (x)), for all
x ∈X.
(d) If f ∈MR(X) or f ∈M(X) then | f | ∈MR(X), where | f |(x) := | f (x)|, x ∈
X.
(e) If fn ∈M(X), or fn ∈MR(X), for any n ∈N and fn(x) →f (x) for all x ∈X
as n →+∞, then f ∈M(X), or f ∈MR(X).
(f) If fn ∈MR(X) and supn∈N fn(x) is ﬁnite for any x ∈X, then the function
X ∋x →supn∈N fn(x) belongs to MR(X).
(g) If fn ∈MR(X) and lim supn∈N fn(x) is ﬁnite for all x ∈X, the function X ∋
x →lim supn∈N fn(x) is an element of MR(X).
(h) If f, g ∈MR(X) the map X ∋x →sup{ f (x), g(x)} is in MR(X).
(i) If f ∈MR(X) and f ≥0, then the map X ∋x →√f (x) is in MR(X).
From now on, as is customary in measure theory, we will work with the extended
real line:
[−∞, ∞] := R := R ∪{−∞, +∞} ,

20
1
Introduction and Mathematical Backgrounds
where R is enlarged by adding two symbols ±∞. The ordering of the reals is extended
by declaring −∞< r < +∞for any r ∈R and deﬁning on R the topology whose
basis consists of real open intervals and the sets [−∞, a), (a, +∞] for any a ∈R
(the notation should be obvious). Moreover one deﬁnes: | −∞| := | + ∞| := +∞.
Now a standard result.
Proposition 1.37 If (X, (X)) is a measurable space, then f : X →R is measur-
able if and only if f −1((a, +∞]) ∈(X) for any a ∈R.
Furthermore, statements (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) of Proposition1.36 still hold when fn
and f are R-valued, with the proviso that one drops ﬁniteness in (f) and (g).
Remark 1.38 (1) In (f), (g) and (h) of Proposition1.36 we may substitute sup with
inf and obtain valid statements.
(2) As far as the ﬁrst statement of Proposition1.37, the analogous statements with
(a, +∞] replaced by [a, +∞], [−∞, a), or [−∞, a] hold.
■
1.4.2
Positive σ-Additive Measures
We pass to deﬁne σ-additive, positive measures.
Deﬁnition 1.39 (Positive measure) If (X, (X)) is a measurable space, a (σ-
additive) positive measure on X (with respect to (X)) is a function μ : (X) →
[0, +∞] satisfying:
(a) μ(∅) = 0
(b) μ

n∈N En

= 
n∈N μ(En) if {En}n∈N ⊂(X), and En ∩Em = ∅if n ̸= m
(σ-additivity).
The triple (X, (X), μ) is called a measure space.
Remark 1.40 (1) The series in (b), having non-negative terms, is well deﬁned and
can be rearranged at will.
(2) Easy consequences of the deﬁnition are the following properties.
Monotonicity: if E ⊂F with E, F ∈(X),
μ(E) ≤μ(F)
Sub-additivity: if {En}n∈N ⊂(X):
μ (∪n∈NEn) ≤

n∈N
μ(En)

Measures on σ-algebras can be constructed using extension techniques, by starting
withmeasuresonalgebras(hencenotclosedundercountableunions).Wewillemploy
such recipes later in the text. An important extension theorem for measures [Hal69]
goes like this.
Theorem 1.41 Let 0(X) be an algebra of sets on X and suppose μ0 : 0(X) →
[0, +∞] is a map satisfying:
(i) Deﬁnition1.39(a),
(ii) Deﬁnition1.39(b) whenever ∪n∈NEn ∈0(X) for Ek ∈0(X), k ∈N.
If (X) denotes the σ-algebra generated by 0(X), then we have
(i)
(X) ∋R →μ(R) := inf

(1.4)
is a σ-additive positive measure on X with respect to (X) that restricts to μ0 on
0(X).
(ii) If X = ∪n∈NXn, with Xn ∈0(X) and μ0(Xn) < +∞for any n ∈N, then μ is
the unique σ-additive positive measure on X, with respect to (X), restricting to μ0
on 0(X).
As we shall use several kinds of positive measures and measure spaces henceforth,
we need to gather some special instances in one place.
Deﬁnition 1.42 (Kinds of positive measures) A measure space (X, (X), μ) and its
(positive, σ-additive) measure μ are called:
(i) ﬁnite, if μ(X) < +∞;
(ii) σ-ﬁnite, if X = ∪n∈NEn, En ∈(X) and μ(En) < +∞for any n ∈N;
(iii) a probability space and probability measure, if μ(X) = 1;
(iv) a Borel space and Borel measure, if (X) = B(X) with X locally compact,
Hausdorff.
In case μ is a Borel measure, and more generally if (X) ⊃B(X), with X locally
compact and Hausdorff, μ is called:
(v) inner regular, if :
μ(E) = sup{μ(K) | K ⊂E ,
K
is compact}
for any E ∈(X);

(vi) outer regular, if:
μ(E) = inf{μ(V ) | V ⊃E ,
V
is open}
for any E ∈(X);
(vii) regular, when simultaneously inner and outer regular.
In the general case the measure μ is concentrated on E ∈(X) when:
μ(S) = μ(E ∩S)
f or any S ∈(X).
Remark 1.43 Inner regularity requires that compact sets belong to the σ-algebra of
sets on which the measure acts. In case of measures on σ-algebras including Borel’s,
this fact is true on locally compact Hausdorff spaces because compact sets are closed
in Hausdorff spaces (Remark 1.22(1)) and hence they belong in the Borel σ-algebra.
A key notion, very often used in the sequel, is that of support of a measure on a Borel
σ-algebra.
Deﬁnition 1.44 Let (X, T (X)) be a topological space and (X) ⊃B(X). The sup-
port of a (positive, σ-additive) measure μ on (X) is the closed subset of X:
supp(μ) := X \

O∈T (X), μ(O)=0
O .
Note how the open set X \ supp(μ) does not necessarily have zero measure. Still,
the following is useful.
Proposition 1.45 If μ : (X) →[0, +∞] is a σ-additive positive measure on X
and (X) ⊃B(X), then μ is concentrated on supp(μ) if at least one of the following
conditions holds:
(i) X has a countable basis for its topology,
(ii) X is Hausdorff, locally compact and μ is inner regular.
Proof Let A := X \ supp(μ) be the union (usually not countable) of all open sets in
X with zero measure. Decompose S ∈(X) into the disjoint union S = (A ∩S) ∪
(supp(μ) ∩S). The additivity of μ implies μ(S) = μ(A ∩S) + μ(supp(μ) ∩S).
By positivity and monotonicity 0 ≤μ(A ∩S) ≤μ(A), so the result holds provided
μ(A) = 0. Let us then prove μ(A) = 0. Under (i), Lindelöf’s lemma guarantees we
can write A as a countable union of open sets of zero measure A = ∪i∈N Ai, and posi-
tivity plus sub-additivity force 0 ≤μ(A) ≤
i∈N μ(Ai) = 0. Therefore μ(A) = 0.
In case (ii), by inner regularity we have μ(A) = 0 if μ(K) = 0, for any compact
set K ⊂A. Since A is a union of zero-measure sets by construction, K will be
covered by open sets of zero measure. By compactness we may then extract a ﬁnite
covering A1, . . . , An. Again by positivity and sub-additivity, 0 ≤μ(K) ≤μ(A1) +
· · · + μ(An) = 0, whence μ(K) = 0, as required.
□
In conclusion we brieﬂy survey zero-measure sets [Coh80, Rud86].

1.4 Round-Up on Measure Theory
23
Deﬁnition 1.46 If (X, (X), μ) is a measure space, a set E ∈(X) has zero mea-
sure if μ(E) = 0. Then E is called a zero-measure set, (more rarely, a null or
negligible set).
The measure space (X, (X), μ) and μ are called complete if, given any E ∈(X)
of zero measure, every subset in E belongs to (X) (so it has zero measure, by
monotonicity).
A property P is said to hold almost everywhere (with respect to μ), shortened
to a.e., if P is true everywhere on X minus a set E of zero measure.
Remark 1.47 (1) Every measure space (X, (X), μ) can be made complete in the
following manner.
Proposition 1.48 If (X, (X), μ) is a (σ-additive, positive) measure space, there is
a measure space (X, ′(X), μ′), called the completion of (X, (X), μ), such that :
(i) ′(X) ⊃(X),
(ii) μ′↾(X)= μ,
(iii) (X, ′(X), μ′) is complete.
The completion can be constructed in the two ensuing ways (yielding the same
measure space).
(a) Take the collection ′(X) of E ⊂X for which there exist AE, BE ∈(X) with
BE ⊂E ⊂AE and μ(AE \ BE) = 0. Then μ′(E) := μ(AE).
(b) Let ′(X) be the collection of subsets of X of the form E ∪Z, where E ∈(X)
and Z ⊂NZ for some NZ ∈(X) with μ(NZ) = 0. Then μ′(E ∪Z) := μ(E).
It is quite evident from (b) that if (X, 1(X), μ1) is a complete measure space such
that, once again, 1(X) ⊃(X), μ1↾(X)= μ, then necessarily 1(X) ⊃′(X) and
μ1↾′(X)= μ′. In this sense the completion of a measure space is the smallest complete
extension. When the initial measure space is already complete, the completion is the
space itself.
Notice that the completion depends heavily on μ: in general, distinct measures
on the same σ-algebra give rise to different completions.
Moreover, measurable functions for the completed σ-algebra are, generally
speaking, no longer measurable for the initial one, whereas the converse is true:
by completing the measurable space we enlarge the class of measurable functions.
(2) If (X, , μ) is a measure space and E ∈, we may restrict  and μ to E
like this: deﬁne ↾E:= {S ∩E | S ∈} and μ↾E (S) := μ(S) for any S ∈↾E. It
should be clear that (E, ↾E, μ↾E) is a measure space corresponding to the natural
restriction of the initial measure on E.
If g : X →C (respectively R, [−∞, +∞], [0, +∞]) is a measurable function
with respect to , then by construction the restriction g↾E of g to E is measurable
with respect to ↾E.
Conversely, if f : E →C (R, [−∞, +∞], [0, +∞]) is measurable with respect
to ↾E, it is simple to show that its extension f : X →C (R, [−∞, +∞], [0, +∞]),
with f (x) = f (x) if x ∈E and f (x) = 0 otherwise, is measurable with respect
to .

Introduction and Mathematical Backgrounds
(3) One can prove [Rud86] that if every fn : X →R, or C, is measurable for n ∈N,
if f (x) = limn→+∞fn(x) a.e. with respect to μ on X and we set f (x) = c for some
constant c ∈R, or C, on the set N where the limit does not exist, then f is measurable.
If μ is complete, f turns out to be measurable irrespective of how we deﬁne it
on N.

1.4.3
Integration of Measurable Functions
We are now ready to deﬁne the integral of a measurable function with respect to a
σ-additive positive measure μ deﬁned on a measurable space (X, (X)). We proceed
in steps, deﬁning the integral on a special class of functions ﬁrst, and then extending
it to the measurable case.
The starting point are functions with values in [0, +∞] := [0, +∞) ∪{+∞}.
For technical reasons it is convenient to extend the notion of sum and product of
non-negative real numbers so that +∞· 0 := 0, +∞· r := +∞if r ∈(0, +∞],
and +∞± r := +∞if r ∈[0, +∞).
A (non-negative) map s : X →[0, +∞] is called simple if it is measurable and its
range is ﬁnite in [0, +∞]. Such a function can be written, for certain s1, . . . , sn ∈
[0, +∞) ∪{+∞}, as:
s =

i=1,...,n
siχEi
where E1, E2, . . . , En are pairwise-disjoint elements of (X) and χEi are the corre-
sponding characteristic functions. The decomposition is not unique. Every function
that can be written like this is simple. The integral of the simple map s with respect
to μ is deﬁned as the number in [0, +∞]:

X
s(x)dμ(x) :=

i=1,2,...,n
siμ(Ei) .
It is not difﬁcult to show that the deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of decom-
position of s = 
i=1,...,n siχEi.
This notion can then be generalised to non-negative measurable functions in the
obvious way: if f : X →[0, +∞] is measurable, let the integral of f with respect
to μ be:

X
f (x)dμ(x) := sup

X
s(x)dμ(x)

s ≥0 is simple and s ≤f

.
Note the integral may equal +∞.

1.4 Round-Up on Measure Theory
25
To justify the deﬁnition, we must remark that simple functions approximate with
arbitrary accuracy non-negative measurable functions, as implied by the ensuing
classical technical result [Rud86] (which we will state for complex functions and
prove in Proposition 7.49).
Proposition 1.49 If f : X →[0, +∞] is measurable, there exists a sequence of
simple maps 0 ≤s1 ≤s2 ≤· · · ≤sn ≤f with sn →f pointwise. The convergence
is uniform if there exists C ∈[0, +∞) such that f (x) ≤C for all x ∈X.
Note that the deﬁnition implies an elementary, yet important property of the integral.
Proposition 1.50 If f, g : X →[0, +∞] are measurable and f (x) ≤g(x) a.e. on
X with respect to μ, then the integrals (in [0, +∞]) satisfy:

X
f (x)dμ(x) ≤

X
g(x)dμ(x) .
To ﬁnish the construction we deﬁne the integral of a complex-valued measurable
function in the most natural way: we write it as sum of its real and imaginary parts
and then decompose the latter two real functions into their respective positive and
negative parts. To overcome having to deal with awkward differences of inﬁnite
quantities we must restrict the class of functions, which we do now by introducing
μ-integrable functions.
Deﬁnition 1.51 (Integral) If (X, (X), μ) is a (σ-additive, positive) measure space,
a measurable map f : X →C is integrable with respect to μ (or in μ), or μ-
integrable, if:

X
| f (x)|dμ(x) < +∞.
Then the integral of f on X with respect to μ is the complex number:

X
f (x)dμ(x) =

X
Re( f )+dμ(x) −

X
Re( f )−dμ(x) + i
	
X
Im( f )+dμ(x) −

X
Im( f )−dμ(x)

,
where, if g : X →R, we deﬁned non-negative maps:
g+(x) := sup{g(x), 0} and
g−(x) := −inf{g(x), 0}
f or any x ∈R.
The set of μ-integrable functions on X will be indicated by L 1(X, μ).
If f ∈L 1(X, μ) and E ⊂X is in the σ-algebra of X, we set:

E
f (x)dμ(x) :=

X
f (x)χE(x) dμ(x) ,
(1.5)
where χE is the characteristic function of E.
It is no problem to check that the integral of f : X →C on X with respect to μ
generalises the integral of a measurable function X →[0, +∞). Also not hard is

the following proposition, that clariﬁes the elementary features of the integral with
respect to the measure μ.
Proposition 1.52 If (X, (X), μ) is a (σ-additive, positive) measure space, then
the measurable maps f, g : X →C satisfy:
(a) if | f (x)| ≤|g(x)| a.e. on X, then g ∈L 1(X, μ) implies f ∈L 1(X, μ).
(b) If f = g a.e. on X then f and g are either both μ-integrable or neither is. In
the former case

X
f (x)dμ(x) =

X
g(x)dμ(x) .
(c) If f, g are μ-integrable, then af + bg is μ-integrable for any chosen a, b ∈C;
moreover,

X
af (x) + bg(x)dμ(x) = a

X
f (x)dμ(x) + b

X
g(x)dμ(x) .
(d) If f ≥0 a.e. and f is μ-integrable, then:

X
f (x)dμ(x) ≥0
and the integral is null only if f = 0 a.e.
(e) If f is μ-integrable, then:

The three central theorems of measure theory are listed below [Rud86].
Theorem 1.54 (Beppo Levi’s monotone convergence) Let (X, (X), μ) be a (posi-
tive and σ-additive) measure space and { fn}n∈N a sequence of measurable functions
X →[0, +∞] such that, a.e. at x ∈X, 0 ≤fn(x) ≤fn+1(x) for all n ∈N.
Then:

X


X
fn(x)dμ(x) ≤+∞,
where the map limn→+∞fn(x) is zero where the limit does not exist, and the integral
is the one deﬁned for functions with values in [0, +∞].

1.4 Round-Up on Measure Theory
27
Theorem 1.55 (Fatou’s lemma) Let (X, (X), μ) be a (σ-additive, positive) mea-
sure space and { fn}n∈N a sequence of measurable maps fn : X →[0, +∞].
Then:

X
lim inf
n→+∞fn(x)dμ(x) ≤lim inf
n→+∞

X
fn(x)dμ(x) ≤+∞,
the integral being the one deﬁned for functions with values in [0, +∞].
Theorem 1.56 (Lebesgue’s dominated convergence) Let (X, (X), μ) be a (posi-
tive, σ-additive) measure space, { fn}n∈N a sequence of measurable maps fn : X →
C, with fn(x) →f (x) a.e. at x ∈X as n →+∞.
If there is a μ-integrable map g : X →C such that | fn(x)| ≤|g(x)| a.e. at x ∈
X for any n ∈N, then f (set to zero where fn(x) ̸→f (x)) is μ-integrable, and
furthermore:

X
f (x)dμ(x) =
lim
n→+∞

X
fn(x)dμ(x) and
lim
n→+∞

X
| f (x) −fn(x)| dμ(x) = 0 .
The next proposition (cf. Remark 1.47(1)) shows that the completion does not really
affect integration, as we expect.
Proposition 1.57 Let (X, , μ) be a measure space and (X, ′, μ′) its completion.
If f : X →Cismeasurablewithrespectto′ thereexistsameasurablemap g : X →
C with respect to  with f = g almost everywhere with respect to μ. If, moreover,
f ∈L 1(X, μ′), then g ∈L 1(X, μ) and

Proof Splitting f into real and imaginary parts and these into their positive and
negative parts with the aid of Proposition1.49, we can construct a sequence s′

respect to  as limit of measurable functions. The limit exists for any x, for it equals,
by construction, 0 on N and f (x) on X \ N. Therefore we proved g is -measurable
and g(x) = f (x) a.e. with respect to μ, as required.
Now to the last statement. By construction |sn(x)| ≤|sn+1(x)| ≤|g(x)|, |s′

1.4.4
Riesz’s Theorem for Positive Borel Measures
Moving on to Borel measures, we mention two important theorems. The ﬁrst is
the well-known Riesz theorem for positive Borel measures [Coh80], which we shall
often use in the sequel: it tells that every linear and positive functional on the space
of continuous maps with compact support on a locally compact, Hausdorff space
is actually an integral. From now on, given a topological space X, Cc(X) will be
the complex vector space of continuous maps f : X →C with compact support.
The vector-space structure of Cc(X) comes from pointwise linear combinations of
f, g ∈Cc(X), with α, β ∈C:
(αf + βg)(x) := αf (x) + βg(x) for all x ∈X.
Theorem 1.58 (Riesz’s theorem for positive Borel measures) Take a locally com-
pact Hausdorff space X and consider a linear functional  : Cc(X) →C such that
f ≥0 whenever f ∈Cc(X) satisﬁes f ≥0. Then there exists a σ-additive, positive
measure μ on the Borel σ-algebra B(X) such that:
f =

X
f dμ i f f ∈Cc(X)
and
μ(K) < +∞when K ⊂X is compact.
The measure μ can be chosen to be regular, in which case it is uniquely determined.
This result can be strengthened to produce a complete measure representing , by
extending (X, B(X), μ) to its completion, and in particular enlarging the Borel
σ-algebra in a way that depends on μ (regular, we may assume). In this way it is
far from evident that the extended measure is still regular. But this is precisely what
happens, because of the following, useful, fact [Coh80].
Proposition 1.59 Let (X, (X), μ) be a measure space, where X is locally com-
pact and Hausdorff and (X) ⊃B(X). If μ is regular, the measure obtained by
completing (X, (X), μ) is regular.
A second valuable comment is that under certain assumptions on X, μ becomes
automatically regular and hence uniquely determined by . This is a consequence
of a technical fact [Rud86, Theorem 2.18], which we recall here.
Proposition 1.60 If ν is a positive Borel measure on a locally compact Hausdorff
space X, and each open set is a countable union of compact sets of ﬁnite measure,
then ν is regular.

1.4 Round-Up on Measure Theory
29
The second pivotal result is Luzin’s theorem [Rud86], according to which on locally
compact Hausdorff spaces, the functions of Cc(X) approximate, so to speak, measur-
able functions when we work with measures on σ-algebras large enough to contain
B(X) and satisfy further conditions (this happens in spaces with Lebesgue measure,
that we shall meet very soon).
Theorem 1.61 (Luzin) Let X be a locally compact Hausdorff space, μ a measure
on a σ-algebra (X) such that:
(i) (X) ⊃B(X),
(ii) μ(K) < +∞if K ⊂X is compact,
(iii) μ is regular,
(iv) μ is complete.
Suppose f : X →C is measurable and such that f (x) = 0 if x ∈X \ A, for some
A ∈(X) with μ(A) < +∞. Then for any ϵ > 0 there is a map g ∈Cc(X) such
that:
μ ({x ∈X | f (x) ̸= g(x)}) < ϵ .
Moreover, g can be chosen so that
sup
x∈X
|g(x)| ≤sup
x∈X
| f (x)|.
Corollary 1.62 Under the same assumptions of Theorem 1.61, if | f | ≤1 there exists
a sequence {gn}n∈N ⊂Cc(X) with |gn| ≤1 for any n ∈N and such that:
f (x) =
lim
n→+∞gn(x) almost everywhere on X.
Remark 1.63 Generally speaking, it is not possible to replace “almost everywhere”
with “everywhere” in the statement above. There are Borel measurable functions
that are not the pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions. The simplest
example is the Dirichlet function, χ : [0, 1] →R, deﬁned as χ(x) = 1 if x ∈Q and
χ(x) = 1 otherwise. However, χ is the pointwise limit of a sequence of functions
which are pointwise limits of sequences of continuous functions.
As a matter of fact, given a Borel σ-algebra, and regardless of the choice of a
measure thereon, there exist Borel-measurable functions which are not the pointwise
limit of any sequence of continuous functions. These issues are properly treated by
the theory of Baire functions: technically, χ is a Baire function of class 2 on the
interval [0, 1] that is not of class 1.

(a) ν is called absolutely continuous with respect to μ (or dominated by μ),
written ν ≺μ, whenever ν(E) = 0 if μ(E) = 0 with E ∈.
(b) ν is singular with respect to μ when there exist A, B ∈, A ∩B = ∅, such
that μ is concentrated on A and ν concentrated on B.
Note μ is singular with respect to ν if and only if ν is singular with respect to μ.

a subset A of B, χA : B →R is the characteristic function of A if χA(x) = 1 for

Lebesgue’s Measure on Rn
Lebesgue’s measure on Rn is the prototype of all abstract positive measures. We
deﬁne it, a posteriori, remembering what we proved in the previous sections. The
starting point is the following proposition, itself a corollary of [Rud86, Theorem
2.20].
Proposition 1.66 Fix n = 1, 2, . . .. There exists a unique σ-additive, positive Borel
measure μn on Rn satisfying:
(i) μn

×n
k=1[ak, bk]

= (b1 −a1)(b2 −a2) · · · (bn −an) if ak ≤bk, ak, bk ∈R,
(ii) μn isinvariantundertranslations: μn(E + t) = μn(E)for E ∈B(Rn),t ∈Rn.
It is possible to extend (Rn, B(Rn), μn) to a measure space (Rn, M (Rn), mn), so
that the measure mn:

1.4 Round-Up on Measure Theory
31
(i) maps compact sets to ﬁnite values,
(ii) is complete,
(iii) is regular,
(iv) is translation-invariant.
The extension is characterised as follows. If A ⊂Rn then A ∈M (Rn) if and only if
F ⊂A ⊂G with μn(G \ F) = 0, where F, G ∈B(Rn) are a countable (at most)
union and intersection of closed and open sets respectively. In such a case mn(A) :=
μn(G).
Remark 1.67 As a consequence, M (Rn) is contained in the completion of B(Rn)
withrespecttoμn (cf.Remark1.47(1)).SinceM (Rn)iscompleteandthecompletion
is the smallest complete extension, we conclude that (Rn, M (Rn), mn) is nothing
but the completion of (Rn, B(Rn), μn).
■
Deﬁnition 1.68 (Lebesgue measure) The measure mn and the σ-algebra M (Rn)
determined by Proposition1.66 are called Lebesgue measure on Rn and Lebesgue
σ-algebra on Rn.
A function f : Rn →C (or R) that is measurable with respect to M (Rn) is said
Lebesgue measurable.
Notation 1.69 From now on we shall often denote Lebesgue’s measure by dx and
not only mn. For example,
mn(E) =

Rn χE(x)dx
if E ∈M (Rn) .
Sometimes we shall speak of Lebesgue measure on a measurable subset, like in
Lebesgue measure on [a, b]. This will mean the restriction of Lebesgue’s measure
on R to [a, b] in the sense of Remark 1.47(2). In such cases we shall tacitly follow
Remark 1.53. In the restricted Lebesgue measure we will drop the symbol↾E. For
example, L 1([a, b], dx) will denote L 1([a, b], dx↾[a,b]).
■
Remark 1.70 (1) The Lebesgue measure mn is invariant under the whole isometry
group of Rn, not just under translations: therefore it is also invariant under rotations,
reﬂections and any composition of these, translations included.
(2) Borel measurable maps f : Rn →C are thus Lebesgue measurable, but the con-
verse is generally false. Continuous maps f : Rn →C trivially belong to both cat-
egories.
(3) The restriction of mn to B(Rn) is just the measure μn of Proposition1.66, hence
a regular Borel measure.
(4) Condition (i) in Proposition1.66 implies, on one hand, that already the Borel
measure μn assigns ﬁnite values to compact sets, these being bounded in Rn. On
the other hand it immediately implies, by monotonicity, that both μn and mn assign
non-zero measure to non-empty open sets. This fact has an important consequence,
expressed by the next useful, albeit simple, proposition.

Introduction and Mathematical Backgrounds
Proposition 1.71 Let μ : B(X) →[0, +∞] be a σ-additive positive measure on X
such that μ(B) > 0 if B ̸= ∅is open. (In particular μ can be the Lebesgue measure
on Rn restricted to an open set X ⊂Rn.) If f : X →C is continuous and f (x) = 0
a.e. with respect to μ, then f (x) = 0 for any x ∈X.
Proof As f is continuous and C \ {0} is open, then B := f −1(C \ {0}) is open. If
we had μ(B) > 0, then f would not be zero almost everywhere. Hence μ(B) = 0
and we must have B = ∅, i.e. f (x) = 0 for all x ∈X.
(5) Invariance under translations in Proposition1.66 is extremely strong a require-
ment. One can prove [Rud86] that if ν : B(Rn) →[0, +∞] maps compact sets
to ﬁnite values and is translation-invariant, there exists a constant c ≥0 such that
ν(E) = cmn(E) for every E ∈B(Rn).

An established result, crucial in computations, is the following.
Proposition 1.72 Given K = [a1, b1] × · · · × [an, bn] ⊂Rn, with −∞< ai <
bi < +∞for i = 1, . . . , n, consider f : Rn →R bounded on K with f (x) = 0
if x ∈Rn \ K.
(a) If n = 1, f is Riemann integrable on K if and only if it is continuous on K
almost everywhere with respect to Lebesgue’s measure on R.
(b) If n ≥1 and f is Riemann integrable on K, then it is Lebesgue measurable
and Lebesgue integrable with respect to Lebesgue’s measure on Rn. Moreover,

Rn f (x)dx =

K
f (x)dxR(x) ,
where on the left is the Lebesgue integral, on the right the Riemann integral.
The two pivotal theorems of calculus, initially formulated for the Riemann integral,
generalise to the Lebesgue integral on the real line as follows. Before that, we need
some deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 1.73 If a, b ∈R, a map f : [a, b] →C has bounded variation on [a, b]
if, however we choose a ﬁnite number of points a = x0 < x1 < · · · < xn = b in the
interval, we have:
n

k=1
| f (xk) −f (xk−1)| ≤C
where C ∈R does not depend on the choice of points xk, nor their number.
A subclass of functions of bounded variation is that of absolutely continuous maps.
Deﬁnition 1.74 If a, b ∈R, f : [a, b] →C is absolutely continuous on [a, b] if
for any ϵ > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that, for any ﬁnite family of pairwise-disjoint,
open subintervals (ak, bk), k = 1, 2, . . . , n,
n

k=1
(bk −ak) < δ
implies
n

k=1
| f (bk) −f (ak)| < ϵ .

1.4 Round-Up on Measure Theory

Remark 1.75 (1) Absolutely continuous functions on [a, b] have bounded variation
and are uniformly continuous (not conversely).
(2) Maps with bounded variation on [a, b], and absolutely continuous ones on [a, b],
form vector spaces. The product of absolutely continuous maps on the compact inter-
val [a, b] is absolutely continuous.
(3) It is not hard to see that a differentiable map f : [a, b] →C (admitting, in partic-
ular, left and right derivatives at the endpoints) with bounded derivative is absolutely
continuous, hence it also has bounded variation on [a, b]. A weaker version is this:
f : [a, b] →C is absolutely continuous if it is Lipschitz, i.e. if there exists L > 0
such that | f (x) −f (y)| ≤L|x −y|, x, y ∈[a, b].
■
Now we are in the position to state [KoFo99] two classical results in real analysis
due to Lebesgue, that generalise the fundamental theorems of Riemann integration
to the Lebesgue integral. Below, dx and dt are Lebesgue measures.
Theorem 1.76 Fix a, b ∈R, a < b.
(a) If f : [a, b] →C is absolutely continuous then it admits derivative f ′(x)
for almost every x ∈[a, b] with respect to Lebesgue’s measure. By deﬁning, say,
f ′(x) := 0 where the derivative does not exist, f ′ becomes Lebesgue measurable,
f ′ ∈L 1([a, b], dx) and
 x

f ′(t)dt = f (x) −f (a)

 x
a f (t)dt isabsolutelycontinuous,
and
d

 x

f (t)dt = f (x) a.e.on [a, b] with respect to Lebesgue′s measure.
To end the section, we mention a famous decomposition theorem for Borel measures
on R that plays a role in spectral theory [ReSi80].
Let μ be a (σ-additive, positive) regular Borel measure on R with μ(K) < +∞
for any compact set K ⊂R.
(i) The set Pμ := {x ∈R | μ({x}) ̸= 0} is called the set of atoms of μ (note Pμ
is either ﬁnite or countable);
(ii) μ is said continuous if Pμ = ∅;
(iii) μ is a purely atomic measure if μ(S) = 
p∈S μ({p}), S ∈B(R).
A (σ-additive, positive) regular Borel measure μ on R with μ(K) < +∞for any
compact set K ⊂R can be decomposed uniquely into a sum:
μ = μpa + μc ,
where μpa is purely atomic and μc continuous, by setting:
μpa(S) := μ(Pμ ∩S) ∀S ∈B(R) and so μc := μ −μpa.

Introduction and Mathematical Backgrounds
More precisely, a key decomposition theorem due to Lebesgue holds. Here is one of
the most elementary versions [ReSi80].
Theorem 1.77 (Lebesgue) Let μ be a σ-ﬁnite regular Borel (σ-additive, positive)
measure on R with μ(K) < +∞for any compact set K ⊂R. Then μ decomposes
in a unique way as the sum of three (σ-additive, positive) measures on B(R)
μ = μac + μpa + μsing .
For the Lebesgue measure (restricted to B(R)), μac is an absolutely continuous
measure, μpa a purely atomic singular measure and μsing is a continuous singular
measure.
1.4.7
The Product Measure
If (X, (X), μ) and (Y, (Y), ν) are measure spaces, we indicate with (X) ⊗
(Y) the σ-algebra on X × Y generated by the family of rectangles E × F with
E ∈(X) and F ∈(Y).
If μ, ν are σ-ﬁnite, one can deﬁne uniquely a σ-ﬁnite measure on (X) ⊗(Y),
written μ ⊗ν, by imposing
μ ⊗ν(E × F) = μ(E)ν(F) if E ∈(X) and F ∈(Y).
This measure μ ⊗ν is called the product measure of μ, ν.
Remark 1.78 (1) We have the following fact [Rud86].
Proposition 1.79 If f is measurable with respect to (X) ⊗(Y), then Y ∋y →
f (x, y)andX ∋x →f (x, y)aremeasurableforany x ∈X and y ∈Y,respectively.
(2) The completion of the product of the Lebesgue measures on Rn and Rm coincides
with the Lebesgue measure on Rn+m [Rud86].
■
The theorems of Fubini and Tonelli, which we state as one, hold.
Theorem 1.80 (Fubini and Tonelli) Let (X, (X), μ), (Y, (Y), ν) be spaces with
σ-ﬁnite measures, and consider a map f : X × Y →C.
(a) If f is μ ⊗ν-integrable:
(i) Y ∋y →f (x, y) is ν-integrable for almost every x ∈X, and X ∋x →
f (x, y) is μ-integrable for almost every y ∈Y,
(ii) X ∋x →

Y f (x, y)dν(y) and Y ∋y →

X f (x, y)dμ(x) (set to zero where
the integrals do not exist) are integrable on X and on Y respectively. Moreover:

(b) Suppose f is measurable with respect to (X) ⊗(Y). Then:

35
(i) if Y ∋y →f (x, y) is ν-integrable for almost every x ∈X, or X ∋x →

dμ(x) < +∞or

Y

X

respectively, then f is μ ⊗ν-integrable.
1.4.8
Complex (and Signed) Measures
We recall a few deﬁnitions and elementary results from the theory of complex func-
tions [Rud86].
Deﬁnition 1.81 (Complex measure) A complex measure on X is a map μ :  →C
associating a complex number to every element in a σ-algebra  on X so that:
(i) μ(∅) = 0 and
(ii) μ(∪n∈NEn) = +∞
n=0 μ(En), independently of the summing order, for any col-
lection {En}n∈N ⊂ with En ∩Em = ∅if n ̸= m.
Under (i)–(ii), if μ() ⊂R, then μ is called a signed measure or charge on X.
Remark 1.82 (1) Requirement (ii) is equivalent to asking absolute convergence of
the series +∞
n=0 μ(En) to μ(∪n∈NEn), by virtue of a generalisation of a classical
result of Riemann on rearranging real series that do not converge absolutely. It easy
to prove that if a series of complex numbers converges absolutely, then it can be
rearranged arbitrarily, to give always the same sum. When, instead, the convergence
is not absolute, the Lévy-Steinitz rearrangement theorem says the sum depends on
the rearrangement, so there are several possible sums. So we conclude that [Rud64]:
Theorem 1.83 If
{zn}n∈N ⊂C,
the
series
+∞
n=0 zn
converges
absolutely
(+∞
n=0 |zn| < +∞) if and only if there exists S ∈C such that +∞
n=0 zP(n) = S for
any bijection P : N →N.
(2) There is a way to generate a ﬁnite positive measure starting from any complex
(or signed) measure, that goes as follows. If E ∈, we shall say {Ei}i∈I ⊂ is a
partition of E if I is ﬁnite or countable, ∪i∈I Ei = E and Ei ∩E j = ∅for i ̸= j.
The σ-additive positive measure |μ| on , called the total variation of μ, is by
deﬁnition:
|μ|(E) := sup

i∈I
|μ(Ei)|
 {Ei}i∈I partition ofE

for any E ∈.

36
1
Introduction and Mathematical Backgrounds
It clearly satisﬁes |μ|(E) ≥|μ(E)| if E ∈. Moreover, |μ|(X) < +∞[Rud86].
Therefore |μ| is a (σ-additive, positive) ﬁnite measure on  for any given complex
measure μ.
■
In analogy to the real case, the support of a complex (or signed) measure on a Borel
σ-algebra is deﬁned below.
Deﬁnition 1.84 If (X, T (X)) is a topological space and (X) ⊃B(X), the support
of a complex (or signed) measure μ on (X) is the closed subset of X:
supp(μ) := X \

O∈T (X), |μ|(O)=0
O .
The deﬁnition of absolutely continuous measure with respect to a given measure
generalises straightforwardly to complex measures.
Deﬁnition 1.85 A complex (or signed) measure ν is absolutely continuous with
respect to a given σ-additive, positive measure μ, or is dominated by μ, ν ≺μ,
whenever both are deﬁned over one σ-algebra  on X and μ(E) = 0 implies ν(E) =
0 for E ∈.
The theorem of Radon–Nikodym (Theorem 1.65) can be generalised to the case of
complex/signed measures [Rud86]:
Theorem 1.86 (Radon–Nikodym theorem for complex and signed measures) Let ν
be a complex (or signed) measure, μ a σ-additive, positive and σ-ﬁnite measure,
both deﬁned on the σ-algebra  over X. If ν ≺μ there exists a map dν
dμ ∈L 1(X, μ)
such that:
ν(E) =

X
χE
dν
dμ dμ
f or any E ∈
where χE is the characteristic function of E ⊂X.
Such map dν
dμ is unique up to sets of zero μ-measure, and is called the Radon–
Nikodym derivative of ν in μ.
The following important result is a corollary of the above [Coh80, Rud86].
Theorem 1.87 (Characterisation of complex measures) For any complex measure
μ on a σ-algebra  on X, there exists a measurable function h : X →C with |h| = 1
on X, unique up to redeﬁnition on zero-measure sets, that belongs in L 1(X, |μ|) and
such that μ(E) =

E h d|μ| for all E ∈.
The same result holds, with the obvious changes, for signed measures.
According to it, if f ∈L 1(X, |μ|) we deﬁne the integral of f with respect to
the complex measure μ by:

1.4.9
Exchanging Derivatives and Integrals
In this ﬁnal section we state the pivotal theorem that allows to differentiate inside
an integral for a general positive measure. The proof is an easy consequence of the
dominated convergence theorem plus Lagrange’s mean value theorem.
Theorem 1.88 (Differentiation inside an integral) In relation to the (σ-additive, pos-
itive) measure space (X, (X), μ), consider the family of maps {ht}t∈A ⊂L 1(X, μ)
where A ⊂Rm is open and t = (t1, . . . , tm). Assume that
(i) for some k ∈{1, 2, . . . , m} the derivative
∂ht(x)
∂tk
exists for any x ∈X and t ∈A;
(ii) there is a map g ∈L 1(X, μ) such that:

∂ht(x)
∂tk
 ≤|g(x)| f or any t ∈A, a.e.on X .
Then:

Remark 1.89 Theorem 1.88 is true also when we take a complex (or signed) measure
μ and replace L 1(X, μ) by L 1(X, |μ|) in the statement. The proof is direct, and
relies on Theorem 1.87.

Chapter 2
Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples
and Applications
I’m convinced mathematics is the most important investigating
tool of the legacy of the human enterprise, it being the source of
everything.
René Descartes
In the book’s ﬁrst proper chapter, we will discuss the fundamental notions and theo-
rems about normed and Banach spaces. We will introduce certain algebraic structures
modelled on natural algebras of operators on Banach spaces. Banach operator alge-
bras play a relevant role in modern formulations of Quantum Mechanics.
The chapter will, in essence, introduce the working language and the elemen-
tary topological instruments of the theory of linear operators. Even if mostly
self-contained, the chapter is by no means exhaustive if compared to the immense
literature on the basic properties of normed and Banach spaces. The texts [Rud86,
Rud91] should be consulted in this respect. In due course we shall specialise to oper-
ators on complex Hilbert spaces, with a short detour in Chap.4 into the more general
features of compact operators.
The most important notions of the present chapter are without any doubt bounded
operators and the various topologies (induced by norms or seminorms) on spaces
of operators. The relevance of these mathematical tools descends from the fact that
the language of linear operators on linear spaces is the language used to formulate
QM. Here the class of bounded operators plays a central technical part, even though
in QM one is forced, on physical grounds, to introduce and work with unbounded
operators too, as we shall see in the second part of the book.
The chapter’s ﬁrst section is devoted to the elementary concepts of normed space,
Banach space and their basic topological properties. We shall discuss examples, like
the space of continuous maps C(K) over a compact space K, and prove the crucial
theorem of Arzelà–Ascoli in this setup. In the examples we will also prove key results
such as the completeness of L p spaces (Fischer–Riesz theorem).

Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
The norm of an operator is deﬁned in the second section, and we will establish its
main features.
Section three presents the fundamental results of Banach spaces, in their sim-
plest versions. These are the theorems of Hahn–Banach, Banach–Steinhaus, plus
the corollary to Baire’s category theorem known as the open mapping theorem. We
will prove a few useful technical consequences (the inverse operator theorem and
the closed graph theorem). Then we will introduce the various operator topologies
that come into play, prove the theorem of Banach–Alaoglu and recall brieﬂy the
Krein–Milman theorem and Fréchet spaces.
Section four is devoted to projection operators in normed spaces. This notion will
be specialised in the subsequent chapter to that of an orthogonal projector, which
will be more useful for our purposes.
In the ﬁnal two sections we will treat two elementary but important topics: equiv-
alent norms (including the proof that n-dimensional normed spaces are Banach and
homeomorphic to the standard Cn) and the theory of contractions in complete normed
spaces (including, in the examples, the proof of the local existence and uniqueness
of solutions to ﬁrst-order ODEs on Rn or Cn). The latter will be the only instance of
nonlinear functional analysis present in the book.
From now onwards we shall assume that the reader is familiar with vector spaces
and linear mappings (a standard reference text for which is [Ser94I]).
2.1
Normed and Banach Spaces and Algebras
After we have adapted the notions of the previous chapter to normed spaces we shall
introduce Banach spaces. Then, by augmenting the algebraic structure with an inner
product, we will study normed and Banach algebras.
2.1.1
Normed Spaces and Essential Topological Properties
The ﬁrst deﬁnitions we present are those of norm, normed space and continuous map
between normed spaces.
Examples of normed spaces, very common in functional analysis and its physical
applications, will be provided later, especially in the next section.
Deﬁnition 2.1 (Normed space) Let X be a vector space over the ﬁeld K = C or R.
A map N : X →R is called a norm on X, and (X, N) is a normed space, if:
N0. N(u) ≥0 for any u ∈X,
N1. N(λu) = |λ|N(u) for any λ ∈K and u ∈X,
N2. N(u + v) ≤N(u) + N(v), for any u, v ∈X,
N3. N(u) = 0 ⇒u = 0, for any u ∈X.
When N0, N1, N2 are valid but N3 does not necessarily hold, N is called a seminorm.

2.1 Normed and Banach Spaces and Algebras
41
Remarks 2.2 (1) Clearly, from N1 descends N(0) = 0, while N2 implies the inequal-
ity:
|N(u) −N(v)| ≤N(u −v) se u, v ∈X.
(2.1)
(2) N1 is called homogeneity property, N2 is known as triangle inequality or sub-
additivity. Together, N0 and N3 are referred to as positive deﬁniteness, whereas N0
alone is sometimes called semi-deﬁniteness.
■
Notation 2.3 Henceforth the symbols || || and p( ), with subscripts if necessary,
will denote a norm and a seminorm respectively. Other symbols might be used as
well.
An elementary yet fundamental notion is that of open ball.
Deﬁnition 2.4 Let (X, || ||) be a normed space.
The open ball of centre x0 ∈X and radius r > 0 is the set:
Br(x0) := {x ∈X | ||x −x0|| < r} .
A set A ⊂X is bounded if there exists an open ball Br(x0) (of ﬁnite radius!) such
that Br(x0) ⊃A.
Later on we shall deﬁne the same object using a seminorm p instead of a norm || ||.
Two useful properties of open balls (valid if using seminorms too), that follow imme-
diately from N2 and the deﬁnition, are:
Bδ(y) ⊂Br(x)
if y ∈Br(x) and 0 < δ + ||y −x|| < r,
(2.2)
Br(x) ∩Br′(x′) = ∅
if 0 < r + r′ < ||x −x′||.
(2.3)
Let us introduce the natural topology of a normed space.
Deﬁnition 2.5 Consider a normed space (X, || ||).
(a) A subset A ⊂X is open if A = ∅or A is the union of open balls.
(b) The norm topology of X is the family of open sets in X.
Remarks 2.6 (1) By (2.2) we have:
A ⊂X is open ⇔∀x ∈A, ∃rx > 0 such that Brx(x) ⊂A.
(2.4)
(2) By deﬁnition of open set and formulas (2.2), (2.4), it follows that open sets
as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 2.5 are also open according to Deﬁnition 1.1. Hence the
collection of open sets in a normed space is indeed an honest topology. The normed
space X equipped with the above family of open sets is a true topological space.
The collection of open balls with arbitrary centres and radii is a basis for the norm
topology of the normed space (X, || ||).

42
2
Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
(3) Each normed space (X, || ||) satisﬁes the Hausdorff property, cf. Deﬁnition 1.3
(and as such is a Hausdorff space).
The proof follows from (2.3) by choosing
A = Br(x), A′ = Br′(x′) with r + r′ < ||x −x′||; the latter is non-zero if x ̸= x′,
by property N3. Had we deﬁned the topology using a seminorm (rather than a norm),
the Hausdorff property would not have been guaranteed.
■
Consider the following statements, valid in any normed space: (a) open neighbour-
hoods can be chosen to be open balls (of radii ε and δ); (b) each open neighbourhood
of a point contains an open ball centred at that point (this follows from the deﬁnition
of open set in a normed space and (2.2)). A straightforward consequence of (a) and
(b) is that continuity, see (1.16), can be equivalently expressed as follows in normed
spaces.
Deﬁnition 2.7 A map f : (X, || ||X) →(Y, || ||Y) between normed spaces is con-
tinuous at x0 ∈X if for any ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that || f (x) −f (x0)||Y < ε
whenever ||x −x0||X < δ.
A map f : X →Y is continuous if it is continuous at each point of X.
Analogously, in normed spaces, convergent sequences (Deﬁnition 1.13) become:
Deﬁnition 2.8 If (X, || ||) is a normed space, the sequence {xn}n∈N ⊂X converges
to x ∈X:
xn →x
as n →+∞or
lim
n→+∞xn = x
ifandonlyifforanyε > 0 thereis Nε ∈Rsuchthat||xn −x|| < ε whenevern > Nε.
Equivalently
lim
n→+∞||xn −x|| = 0 .
The point x is the limit of the sequence.
Remark 2.9 If (X, || ||) is a normed space and A ⊂X a subset, a point x ∈X is a
limit point of A if and only if there is a sequence {xn}n∈N ⊂A \ {x} converging to x.
In fact if x is a limit point for A, every open ball B1/n(x), n = 1, 2, . . ., contains at
least one point xn ∈A \ {x}, and by construction xn →x as n →+∞. Conversely,
let {xn}n∈N ⊂A \ {x} tend to x. Since every open neighbourhood B of x contains a
ball Bε(x) centred at x by (2.4), the deﬁnition of convergence implies Bε(x), and so
B, contains every point xn with n > Nε for some Nε ∈R. Thus x is a limit point. ■
A nice class of continuous linear functions is that of isometries.
Deﬁnition 2.10 If (X, || ||X), (Y, || ||Y) are normed spaces over the same ﬁeld C or
R, a linear map L : X →Y is called isometric, or an isometry, if ||L(x)||Y = ||x||X
for all x ∈X.
If the isometry L : X →Y is onto, it is an isomorphism of normed spaces.
Given an isomorphism L of normed spaces, the domain and codomain are called
isomorphic (under L).

2.1 Normed and Banach Spaces and Algebras
43
Remarks 2.11 (1) It is obvious that an isometry L : X →Y is injective, by N3, but it
maynotbeonto.IfX = Y and L isnotsurjective,thenX mustbeinﬁnite-dimensional.
(2) Since the pre-image of an open ball under an isometry is an open ball, each isom-
etry f : X →Y between normed spaces X, Y is continuous in the two topologies.
(3) If an isometry f : X →Y is onto (an isomorphism), its inverse f −1 : Y →X is
still linear and isometric, hence an isomorphism. An isomorphism of normed spaces
is clearly a (linear) homeomorphisms of the two topological spaces.
(4) Other textbooks may provide a different deﬁnition, not equivalent to ours, of
isomorphism of normed spaces. They typically require an isomorphism be only
a linear continuous map with continuous inverse (i.e. a linear homeomorphism).
An isomorphism according to Deﬁnition 2.10 is also such in this second meaning,
but not conversely. Having f, f −1 both continuous is much weaker a condition
than preserving norms. For instance f : X ∋x →ax ∈X, with a ̸= 0 ﬁxed, is an
isomorphism from X to itself for the second deﬁnition, but not in our sense.
■
A further technical result that we wish to present is the direct analogue of something
that happens in the space R normed by the absolute value.
Proposition 2.12 A function f : X →Y between normed spaces X, Y is continuous
at x ∈X if and only if it is sequentially continuous at x, i.e. f (xn) →f (x) as
n →+∞, for any sequence {xn}n∈N ⊂X such that xn →x as n →+∞.
Proof If f is continuous at x, let {xn}n∈N ⊂X tend to x. By continuity, for any
ε > 0 there is δ > 0 such that || f (xn) −f (x)||Y < ε when ||xn −x||X < δ. Since
||xn −x|| →0, then for any ε > 0 there is Nε ∈R such that || f (xn) −f (x)||Y < ε
whenever n > Nε. Thus f is sequentially continuous at x. Now assume f is not
continuous at x0, and let us show it cannot be sequentially continuous at x. With
these assumptions there must be ε > 0 such that for any n = 1, 2, . . ., there exists
xn ∈X with ||xn −x||X < 1/n but || f (x) −f (xn)||Y > ε. The sequence {xn}n=1,2,...
tends to x, but the corresponding images { f (xn)}n=1,2,... do not converge to f (x) in
Y. Therefore f is not sequentially continuous at x.
⊓⊔
At last we want to discuss continuity properties of the vector-space operations with
respect to the norm topologies on normed spaces.
If (X, || ||X), (Y, || ||Y) are normed spaces over the same ﬁeld K = C or R, we
can form the Cartesian product Y × X and its product topology, induced by the
topologies of the factors X, Y (cf. 1.10). This topology has as open sets the empty
set and the unions of Cartesian products of open balls in X and Y. In case Y = X,
we can study the continuity of the sum of two vectors in X × X:
+ : X × X ∋(u, v) →u + v ∈X ,
where X × X has the product topology. From N2
||u + v|| ≤||u|| + ||v||,

Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
making the operation + jointly continuous in its two arguments with respect to the
norm topologies. Said otherwise, the addition is continuous in the product topology
of the domain and the standard topology of the range.
In fact, the triangle inequality implies that given (u0, v0) ∈X × X and ε > 0, then
u + v ∈Bε(u0 + v0) provided (u, v) ∈Bδ(u0) × Bδ(v0) with 0 < δ < ε/2.
If Y is the ﬁeld K = R or C, thought of as normed by the modulus, we can consider
the continuity of the product between a scalar and a vector in K × X:
K × X ∋(α, u) →αu ∈X ,
where the left-hand side has the product topology. From N2 and N1,
||αu|| = |α| ||u||
implies that the multiplication by scalars is a jointly continuous operation in its
arguments in the two norm topologies; that is to say, it is continuous with respect to
the product topology on the domain and the standard one on the range. Here too the
proofiseasy:fromtheaboveidentityandN2,given(α0, u0) ∈K × X andε > 0,then

and 0 < δ′ < ε/(2(||u0|| + δ)). (B(K)
δ′ (α) denotes an open ball in the normed space
K.)
2.1.2
Banach Spaces
Some of the above material can be adapted to completely general topological spaces.
At the same time there are properties, like completeness (which we treat below), that
beﬁt the theory of normed spaces (and more generally metrisable spaces, which we
will only mention elsewhere, in passing).
A well-known fact from the elementary theory on Rn is that convergent sequences
{xn}n∈N in a normed space (X, || ||) satisfy the Cauchy property:
Deﬁnition 2.13 (Cauchy property) A sequence {xn}n∈N in a normed space (X, || ||)
satisﬁes the Cauchy property if, for any ε > 0, there exists Nε ∈R such that ||xn −
xm|| < ε whenever n, m > Nε.
Such a sequence is called a Cauchy sequence.
In fact, suppose {xn}n∈N converges. This means ||xn −x|| →0 as n →+∞. Then
||xk −x|| < ε for k > Nε, so ||xn −xm|| ≤||xn −x|| + ||xm −x|| < ε for n, m >
Nε/2.
The idea of the above argument is that if a sequence converges to some point, its
terms get closer to one another. It is interesting to see whether the converse holds as
well: does a sequence of vectors that become closer always admit a limit?
As is well known from elementary calculus, the answer is yes on X = R with the
absolute value norm. Therefore it is true also on C and on any vector space built over

2.1 Normed and Banach Spaces and Algebras
45
Cartesian products of standard copies of Rn, Cn. This is guaranteed by the fact that
R satisﬁes the completeness axiom.
Normed spaces in which Cauchy sequences are convergent are called complete
normedspaces.Ageneralnormedspaceis notcomplete,andcompletenormedspaces
are scarce, hence interesting by default. They have relevant and useful features,
especially for the physical applications that will be the object of the book.
Deﬁnition 2.14 (Banach space) A normed space is called a Banach space if it is
complete, i.e. if any Cauchy sequence inside the space converges to a point of the
space.
Remarks 2.15 (1)Thepropertyofbeingcompleteisinvariantunderisomorphismsof
normed spaces, but not under homeomorphisms (continuous maps with continuous
inverses, not necessarily linear). A counterexample is provided by the pair R and
(0, 1), both normed by the absolute value. Although they are homeomorphic, the
line is complete, the interval is not.
(2) It is easy to prove that any closed subspace M in a Banach space B is itself a
Banach space for the restricted norm: each Cauchy sequence in M is Cauchy for B
too, so it must converge to a point in B. But this point must belong to M because M
is closed and contains its limit points.

The spaces Cn and Rn with standard norm:

are the simplest instances of ﬁnite-dimensional Banach spaces, respectively complex
and real. As a matter of fact we shall prove in Sect.2.5 that every ﬁnite-dimensional
complex Banach space is homeomorphic to a standard Cn, and show explicit exam-
ples of Banach spaces starting from the next section. At any rate, any normed space
satisﬁes a nice property: it can be completed to a Banach space determined by it, in
which it is moreover dense.
Theorem 2.16 (Completion of Banach spaces) Let (X, || ||) be a normed vector
space over K = C or R.
(a) There exists a Banach space (Y, N) over K, called completion of X, such that
X is isometrically identiﬁed with a dense subspace of Y under a linear injective
mapping J : X →Y.
Put otherwise, there is a linear 1-1 map J : X →Y with
J(X) = Y
and
N(J(x)) = ||x||
for any x ∈X.
(b) If the triple (J1, Y1, N1), with J1 : X →Y1 a linear isometry and (Y1, N1) a
Banach space on K, is such that (X, || ||) is isometric to a dense subspace of Y1
under J1, then there is a unique isomorphism of normed spaces φ : Y →Y1 such
that J1 = φ ◦J.

(a) Let C denote the space of Cauchy sequences in X and deﬁne the equivalence
relation on C:
xn ∼x′
n
⇔
lim
n→∞||xn −x′
n|| = 0 .
Clearly we can think that X ⊂C/∼by identifying each x of X with the equivalence
class of the constant sequence xn = x. Let J be the identiﬁcation map. Then C/∼is
easily a K-vector space with norm induced by the structure of X. Now one should
prove that C/∼is complete, that J is linear and isometric (hence 1-1) and that J(X)
is dense in Y := C/∼.
(b) J1 ◦J −1 : J(X) →Y1 is a linear and continuous isometry from a dense set
J(X) ⊂Y to a Banach space Y1, so it extends uniquely to a linear, continuous
isometry φ on Y (see Proposition 2.47). As φ is isometric, it is injective. The
same is true about the extension φ′ of J ◦J −1
1
: J1(X) →Y, and by construc-
tion (J ◦J −1
1 ) ◦(J1 ◦J −1) = idJ(X). Extending to J(X) = Y by continuity, we see
φ′ ◦φ = idY, and similarly φ ◦φ′ = idY1. In conclusion φ and φ′ are onto, so in
particular φ is an isomorphism of normed spaces and by construction J1 = φ ◦J.
The uniqueness of an isomorphism φ : Y →Y′ satisfying J1 = φ ◦J is easy, once
one notices that each such map ψ : Y →Y1 fulﬁls J −J = (φ −ψ) ◦J by lin-
earity, hence (φ −ψ) ↾J(X)= 0. The uniqueness of the extension of (φ −ψ) ↾J(X),
continuous and with dense domain J(X), to J(X) = Y, eventually warrants that
φ = ψ.
⊓⊔
The next proposition is a useful criterion to check if a normed space is Banach.
Proposition 2.17 Let (X, || ||) be a normed space, and assume every absolutely
convergent series +∞
n=0 xn of elements of X (i.e. +∞
n=0 ||xn|| < +∞) converges in
X. Then (X, || ||) is a Banach space.
Proof Take a Cauchy sequence{vn}n∈N ⊂X and let us show that if the above property
holds, the sequence converges in X. Since the sequence is Cauchy, for any k =
0, 1, 2, . . . there is Nk such that ||vn −vm|| < 2−k whenever n, m ≥Nk. Choose Nk
so that Nk+1 > Nk and extract the subsequence {vNk}k∈N. Now deﬁne vectors z0 :=
vN1, zk := vNk+1 −vNk and consider the series +∞
k=0 zk. Notice vNk = k
k′=0 zk′. By
construction ||zk|| < 2−k, so the series converges absolutely. Under the assumptions
made, there will exist v ∈X such that:
lim
k→+∞vNk = lim
k→+∞
k

k′=0
zk′ = v .
Hence the subsequence {vNk}k∈N of the Cauchy sequence {vn}n∈N converges to v ∈X.
To ﬁnish it sufﬁces to show that the whole {vn}n∈N converges to v. As
||vn −v|| ≤||vn −vNk|| + ||vNk −v|| ,

2.1 Normed and Banach Spaces and Algebras
47
for a given ε > 0 we can ﬁnd Nε such that ||vn −vNk|| < ε/2 whenever n, Nk > Nε,
because {vn}n∈N is a Cauchy sequence. On the other hand we can also ﬁnd Mε such
that ||vNk −v|| < ε/2 whenever k > Mε, since vNk →v. Therefore taking k > Mε
large enough, so that Nk > Nε, we have ||vn −v|| < ε for n > Nε. As ε > 0 was
arbitrary, we have vn →v as n →+∞.
⊓⊔
2.1.3
Example: The Banach Space C(K; Kn), The Theorems
of Dini and Arzelà–Ascoli
One of the simplest examples of a non-trivial (and generically, inﬁnite-dimensional)
Banach space is C(K; Kn), the space of continuous maps from a compact space
K to Kn, with K = C or R. The chosen norm is the supremum norm || f ||∞:=
supx∈K || f (x)||. This is always ﬁnite for f ∈C(K; Kn) (Proposition 1.21).
Proposition 2.18 Let K = C (or R) and consider the normed space (Kn, || ||) with
norm (1.1). If K is compact, the vector space C(K; Kn) of continuous maps from K
to Kn, equipped with the norm:
|| f ||∞:= sup
x∈K
|| f (x)|| ,
is a complex (or real) Banach space.
Proof Let { fn}n∈N ⊂C(K; K) be a Cauchy sequence. We want to show there is
f ∈C(K; K) such that || fn −f ||∞→0 as n →+∞. Since { fn}n∈N is Cauchy, for
any given x ∈K, also n-tuples fn(x) ∈Kn are a Cauchy sequence. Thus, since Kn
is complete, we have a pointwise-deﬁned map:
f (x) :=
lim
n→+∞fn(x) .
The claim is that f ∈C(K; K) and || fn −f ||∞→0 as n →+∞. Since { fn}n∈N is
Cauchy, for any ε > 0 there is Nε such that, if n, m > Nε,
|| fn(x) −fm(x)|| < ε ,
for every x ∈K.
By deﬁnition of f , on the other hand, for a given x ∈K and any ε′
x > 0, there is
Nx,ε′x such that || fm(x) −f (x)|| < ε′
x whenever m > Nx,ε′x. Using these two facts
we have
|| fn(x) −f (x)|| ≤|| fn(x) −fm(x)|| + || fm(x) −f (x)|| < ε + ε′
x
provided n > Nε and choosing m > max(Nε, Nx,ε′x). Overall, if n > Nε, then
|| fn(x) −f (x)|| < ε + ε′
x ,
for any ε′
x > 0.

48
2
Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
Since ε′
x > 0 is arbitrary, the inequality holds when ε′
x = 0, possibly becoming an
equality. Thus the dependency on x disappears, and in conclusion, for any ε > 0 we
have found Nε ∈N such that
|| fn(x) −f (x)|| ≤ε ,
for all x ∈K
(2.5)
when n > Nε. Hence { fn} converges to f uniformly. Since (2.5) holds for any
x ∈K, it holds for the supremum on K: for any ε > 0 there is Nε ∈N such that
supx∈K || fn(x) −f (x)|| < ε, whenever n > Nε. Put differently,
|| fn −f ||∞→0 ,
as n →+∞.
To ﬁnish we must prove f is continuous. Given x ∈K, for any ε > 0 we will ﬁnd δ >
0 such that || f (x′) −f (x)|| < ε when ||x′ −x|| < δ. For that, we exploit uniform
convergence and choose n such that || f (z) −fn(z)|| < ε/3 for the given ε and
any z ∈K. Furthermore, as fn is continuous, there is δ > 0 such that || fn(x′) −
fn(x)|| < ε/3 whenever ||x′ −x|| < δ. Putting everything together and using the
triangle inequality allows to conclude the following: if ||x′ −x|| < δ,
|| f (x′) −f (x)|| ≤|| f (x′) −fn(x′)|| + || fn(x′) −fn(x)|| + || fn(x) −f (x)||
< ε/3 + ε/3 + ε/3 = ε
as claimed, so f ∈C(K; K).
⊓⊔
Notation 2.19 From now on we will write C(K) := C(K; C).
■
A useful analytical result about the uniform convergence of monotone sequences
of real functions on compact sets is a classical result of Dini.
Theorem 2.20 (Dini’s theorem on uniform convergence) Let K be a compact space
and take { fn}n∈N ⊂C(K; R) such that:
(i) each fn is continuous,
(ii) fn(x) ≤fn+1(x) for n = 1, 2, . . . and x ∈K,
(iii) fn →f pointwise as n →+∞.
Then, if f is continuous, || f −fn||∞→0 as n →+∞.
The same is true if (ii) is replaced with: fn(x) ≥fn+1(x).
Proof Fix ε > 0 and deﬁne gn := f −fn for any n ∈N. Denote by Bn the set of x ∈
K for which gn(x) < ε. As gn is continuous, the set Bn is open, and Bn+1 ⊃Bn since
gn+1(x) ≤gn(x), by construction. Since gn(x) →0, then necessarily ∪n∈NBn =
K. But K is compact, so we can choose sets Bn1, Bn2, . . . BnN so that Bnk+1 ⊃Bnk
and Bn1 ∪Bn2 ∪· · · ∪BnN ⊃K. As K ⊃Bnk+1 ⊃Bnk, we have BnN = K. Hence for
the given ε > 0, there exists nN such that | f (x) −fn(x)| < ε for n > nN, x ∈K.
Therefore || f −fn||∞< ε, as claimed. The case fn(x) ≥fn+1(x) is completely
analogous.
⊓⊔

2.1 Normed and Banach Spaces and Algebras
49
In the special case K is a compact set containing a dense and countable subset, the
Banach space C(K) has an interesting property by the theorem of Arzelà–Ascoli. We
state below the simplest version of this result: even if it is not strictly related to the
contents of this book, its importance (especially in the more general form) and the
stereotypical strategy of proof make it worthy of attention.
Deﬁnition 2.21 A sequence { fn}n∈N of functions fn : X →C on a normed space1
(X, || ||) is equicontinuous if for any ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that | fn(x) −
fn(x′)| < ε whenever ||x −x′|| < δ for every n ∈N and every x, x′ ∈X.
Theorem 2.22 (Arzelà–Ascoli) Let K be a compact and separable (cf. Deﬁnition
1.5) space. Suppose a sequence of functions { fn}n∈N ⊂C(K) is:
(a) equicontinuous
and
(b) bounded by some C ∈R, i.e. || fn||∞< C for any n ∈N.
Then there exists a subsequence { fnk}k∈N converging to some map f ∈C(K) in the
topology induced by the norm || ||∞.
Proof Consider the points q of a dense and countable set Q ⊂K and label them
by N. If q1 denotes the ﬁrst point, consider the values | fn(q1)| as n varies. They
lie in a compact set [0, C], so either there are ﬁnitely many, and fn(q1) = x1 ∈C
for a single x1 and inﬁnitely many n, or the fn(q1) accumulate at x1 ∈C. In either
case there is a subsequence { fnk}k∈N such that fnk(q1) →x1 ∈C for some x1 ∈C.
Call the elements of { fnk}k∈N by f1n, where n ∈N. Now repeat the procedure and
consider | f1n(q2)|, where q2 is the second point of Q, and extract a subsequence
{ f2n}n∈N from { f1n}n∈N. By construction, f2n(q1) →x1 and f2n(q2) →x2 ∈C, as
n →+∞. Continuing in this way for every k ∈N we end up building a subsequence
{ fkn}n∈N of { fn}n∈N that converges to x1, x2, . . . , xk ∈C when evaluated at the points
q1, q2, . . . , qk ∈Q. Take the subsequence of { fn}n∈N formed by all diagonal terms in
the various subsequences, { fnn}n∈N. We claim this is a Cauchy sequence for || ||∞.
So let us ﬁx ε > 0 and ﬁnd the δ > 0 corresponding to ε/3 by equicontinuity, then
cover K with balls of radius δ centred at every point of K. Using the compactness of
K we extract a ﬁnite covering of balls with radius δ, say B(1)
δ , B(2)
δ , . . . , B(N)
δ
, and
choose q( j) ∈B( j)
δ
∩Q, for any j = 1, . . . , N. For any x ∈B( j)
δ
we have:
| fnn(s) −fmm(s)|
≤| fnn(s) −fnn(q( j))| + | fnn(q( j)) −fmm(q( j))| + | fmm(q( j)) −fmm(s)| .
The ﬁrst and third terms are smaller than ε/3 by construction. Since fnn(q( j)) con-
verges in C as n →+∞, the second term is less than ε/3 provided n, m > M( j)
ε
for
some M( j)
ε
≥0. Hence if Mε = max j=1,...,N M( j)
ε :
| fnn(s) −fmm(s)| < ε
for n, m > Mε, and any s ∈K.
1The deﬁnition generalises to metric spaces in the obvious way.

In other words
|| fnn −fmm||∞< ε
if n, m > Mε
as claimed.
⊓⊔
Remarks 2.23 (1) The theorem applies in particular when K is the closure of a non-
empty open and bounded set A ⊂Rn, because points with rational coordinates form
a countable dense subset in K. Moreover, the same proof holds (trivial changes apart)
if we replace C(K) with C(K; Kn).
(2) We will prove in Chap.4, Proposition 4.3, that in a normed space (X, || ||) a subset
A ⊂X is relatively compact (its closure is compact) if we can extract a convergent
subsequence from any sequence of A. By virtue of this fact, the theorem of Arzelà–
Ascoli actually says the following:
if K is a compact separable space, every equicontinuous subset of C(K) that is
bounded for || ||∞is relatively compact in (C(K), || ||∞).
(3) An important result in functional analysis [Mrr01], which we will not prove, is
the Banach–Mazur theorem: any complex separable Banach space is isometrically
isomorphic to a closed subspace of (C([0, 1]), || ||∞).
■
Several examples of Banach spaces will be given at the end of the next section, after
we have talked about normed and Banach algebras.
2.1.4
Normed Algebras, Banach Algebras and Examples
As we shall see in a moment, in many applications there is a tight connection between
algebras and normed spaces, which goes through linear operators on a normed space.
The most important normed algebras in physics are, as a matter of fact, operator
algebras.
But the notions of algebra and normed algebra are completely independent of
operators. An algebra arises by enriching a vector space with a product that is asso-
ciative, distributes over the sum and behaves associatively for the multiplication by
scalars. A normed algebra is an algebra equipped with a norm that renders the vector
space normed and behaves “properly” with respect to the product. Here are the main
deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 2.24 (Algebra) An (associative) algebra A over the ﬁeld K = C or R is
a K-vector space with an operation ◦: A × A →A, called product, that is associa-
tive:
(a ◦b) ◦c = a ◦(b ◦c) for each triple a, b, c ∈A
(2.6)
and distributes over the vector space operations:
A1. a ◦(b + c) = a ◦b + a ◦c
∀a, b, c ∈A,
A2. (b + c) ◦a = b ◦a + c ◦a
∀a, b, c ∈A,

2.1 Normed and Banach Spaces and Algebras
51
A3. α(a ◦b) = (αa) ◦b = a ◦(αb)
∀α ∈K and ∀a, b ∈A.
The algebra (A, ◦) is called:
commutative, or Abelian, if
A4. a ◦b = b ◦a for any pair a, b ∈A;
unital (or with unit) if it contains an element I, called unit of the algebra, such
that:
A5. I ◦u = u ◦I = u for any a ∈A;
a normed algebra or normed unital algebra if it is a normed vector space with
norm || || satisfying
A6. ||a ◦b|| ≤||a||||b|| for a, b ∈A,
and in presence of a unit I also:
A7. ||I|| = 1;
a Banach algebra or Banach algebra with unit if A is a Banach space plus a
normed algebra, or normed unital algebra, for the same norm.
A homomorphism φ : A1 →A2 between algebras, whether unital, normed or
Banach, is a linear map preserving products, and units if present (but not necessarily
the norms if present):
φ(a ◦1 b) = φ(a) ◦2 φ(b) if a, b ∈A1,
φ(I1) = I2 ,
using the obvious notations. A bijective algebra homomorphism φ : A →A′
(between normed or Banach algebras, with or without unit) is an algebra isomor-
phism, and an algebra automorphism if A = A′.
If there is an isomorphism φ : A →A′, the algebras A, A′ (normed/Banach/with
unit) are said to be isomorphic, and isometrically isomorphic if the isomorphism
also preserves the norms.
A (normed/Banach/unital) subalgebra is a subset A1 ⊂A in a (normed/Banach/
unital) algebra A that inherits the algebra structure by restricting the algebra opera-
tions (if present: the same unit of A, the restricted norm of A, and completeness if A
is Banach).
Remarks 2.25 (1) The norm does not show up in the deﬁnition of homomorphism
and isomorphism between the various kinds of algebra.
(2) If a unit exists it must be unique: if both I and I′ satisfy A5, then I′ = I′ ◦I = I.
■
For normed algebras, the above axioms easily imply that all operations are continuous
in the norm topologies involved. We showed in Sect.2.1.1 that this is true for the
sum and the multiplication by scalars. The product ◦, too, is jointly continuous in its
arguments (i.e. in the product topology of A × A) and hence also continuous in each
argument alone.

52

Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
Proposition 2.26 If A is a normed algebra (with product ◦), the map
A × A ∋(a, b) →a ◦b ∈A
is continuous using the product topology in the domain.
Proof Dropping the symbol ◦, we have
||ab −a0b0|| = ||ab −a0b + a0b −a0b0|| ≤||a −a0|| ||b|| + ||a0|| ||b −b0|| .
Fixing ε > 0, since the norm is continuous in its own-induced topology, there is
δ0 > 0 such that ||b −b0|| < δ0 implies −1 < ||b|| −||b0|| < 1. Therefore:
||ab −a0b0|| = ||ab −a0b + a0b −a0b0|| ≤||b −b0||(1 + ||b0|| + ||a0||) .
Choosingnowδ ≤min(δ0, ε/(1 + ||b0|| + ||a0||))andconsideringelements(a, b) ∈
Bδ(a0) × Bδ(b0):
||ab −a0b0|| < ε .
This proves the continuity of ◦in the product topology of A × A.
⊓⊔
We now pass to show that, in a unital Banach algebra, the map a →a−1 is continuous
if its domain is suitably deﬁned.
Proposition 2.27 Let A be a unital Banach algebra (with unit I and product ◦). The
group
GA := {a ∈A | ∃a−1 ∈A such that a ◦a−1 = a−1 ◦a = I}
is open in A and the map GA ∋a →a−1 ∈A is continuous.
Proof First we shall show that if A is a Banach algebra, then GA is open so that it
makes sense to invert elements in a neighbourhood of any a0 ∈GA. Next we will
prove that the map GA ∋a →a−1 is continuous. With a ∈A, the series
+∞

n=0
(−1)nan
converges in the norm topology when ||a|| < 1, because its partial sums are Cauchy
sequences and the space is complete by hypothesis. The proof now is the same as for
the convergence of the geometric series. Moreover, since the product is continuous:
(I + a)
+∞

n=0
(−1)nan =


n=0
(−1)n(I + a)an = I + lim
n→+∞(−1)n+1an = I .

Similarly:

(I + a) = I .
Hence if ||a|| < 1 we have I + a ∈GA and:

At this point, if b ∈GA we can write c = b + c −b = b(I + b−1(c −b)). Therefore
||b−1(c −b)|| < 1 implies c has an inverse:
c−1 =

(−1)n((c −b)b−1)nb−1 .
In particular, if b ∈GA and we ﬁx 0 < δ < 1/||b−1||, then c ∈Bδ(b) gives c ∈GA,
because ||b−1(c −b)|| ≤||b−1|| ||(c −b)|| < 1. Thus we have proved GA open.

Notation 2.28 In the sequel we will conventionally denote the product of two ele-
ments of an algebra by juxtaposition, as in ab, rather than by a ◦b. In other contexts
a dot might be used: f · g, especially when working with functions.

Examples 2.29 Let us see examples of Banach spaces and Banach algebras, a few
of which will require some abstract measure theory.

Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
(1) The number ﬁelds C and R are commutative Banach algebras with unit. For both
the norm is the modulus/absolute value.
(2) Given any set X, and K = C or R, let L(X) be the set of bounded maps f : X →
K, i.e. supx∈X | f (x)| < ∞. Then L(X) is naturally a K-vector space for the usual
linear combinations: if α, β ∈C and f, g ∈L(X),
(αf + βg)(x) := αf (x) + βg(x) for all x ∈X.
We can deﬁne a product making L(X) an algebra: for f, g ∈L(X),
( f · g)(x) := f (x)g(x) for any x ∈X.
The algebra is commutative and has a unit (the constant map 1). A norm that renders
L(X) Banach is the sup norm: || f ||∞:= supx∈X | f (x)|. The proof is simple (it uses
the completeness of C, and goes pointwise on X) and can be found in the exercises
at the end of the chapter.
(3) Deﬁne on the above X a σ-algebra Σ. The subalgebra of Σ-measurable functions
Mb(X) ⊂L(X) is closed in L(X) in the topology of the sup norm. Thus Mb(X) is a
commutative Banach algebra. This is immediate from the previous example, because
the pointwise limit of measurable maps is measurable.
(4) The vector space of continuous maps from a topological space X to C is written
C(X); the symbol already appeared for X compact in Sect.2.1.3.
We indicate by Cb(X) ⊂C(X) the subspace of bounded continuous maps and by
Cc(X) ⊂Cb(X) the space of continuous maps with compact support.
These all coincide if X compact, and are clearly commutative algebras for the
operations of example (2). The algebras C(X) and Cb(X) have the constant map 1
as unit, whereas Cc(X) has no unit when X is not compact. Here is a list of general
properties:
(a) Cb(X) is a Banach algebra for the sup norm || ||∞.
(b) If X = K is compact, Cc(K) = C(K) is a Banach algebra with unit for the sup
norm || ||∞, as we saw in Sect.2.1.3. An important result in the theory of Banach
algebras [Rud91] states that any commutative Banach algebra with unit over C is
isomorphic to an algebra C(K) for some compact space K.
(c) If the space X is
1. Hausdorff and
2. locally compact,
then the completion of the normed space Cc(X) is a commutative Banach algebra
C0(X) (without unit), called algebra of continuous maps f : X →C that vanish
at inﬁnity [Rud86]: this means that for any ε > 0 there is a compact set Kε ⊂X
(depending on f in general) such that | f (x)| < ε for any x ∈X \ Kε.

2.1 Normed and Banach Spaces and Algebras
55
(d) Irrespective of compactness, C(X), Cc(X), C0(X) are in general not dense
in Mb(X) (using || ||∞and the Borel σ-algebra on X). If we take X = [0, 1] for
instance, the bounded map f : [0, 1] →C equal to 0 except for f (1/2) = 2 is Borel
measurable (with the standard topologies on C and the induced one on [0, 1]), hence
f ∈Mb([0, 1]). However, there cannot exist any sequence of continuous maps fn :
[0, 1] →C converging to f uniformly. The same can be said if X ⊂Rn is a compact
set with non-empty interior and we take f : X →C to be f (q) = 0 for q ∈X \ {p},
p ∈Int(X), and f (p) = 1.
(5) If X is Hausdorff and compact, consider a subalgebra A in C(X) that contains the
unit (the function 1) and is closed under complex conjugation: f ∈A ⇒f ∗∈A,
where f ∗(x) := f (x) for any x ∈X and the bar denotes complex conjugation. Then
A is said to separate points in X if, given any x, y ∈X with x ̸= y, there is a map
f ∈A satisfying f (x) ̸= f (y). The Stone-Weierstrass theorem [Rud91] says the
following.
Theorem 2.30 (Stone-Weierstrass) Let X be a compact Hausdorff space and con-
sider the Banach algebra with unit (C(X), || ||∞). Then any subalgebra A ⊂C(X)
containing the unit, closed under complex conjugation and that separates points has
C(X) as closure with respect to || ||∞.
A typical example is the algebra A of complex polynomials in n variables (the stan-
dard coordinates of Rn) restricted to a compact subset X in Rn. The theorem asserts
that these polynomials approximate uniformly any continuous complex function on
X. This is useful to construct bases in Hilbert spaces, as we shall explain later.
(6) Let (X, Σ, μ) be a positive, σ-additive measure space. Recall this means a set
X, a σ-algebra Σ of subsets in X and a positive and σ-additive measure μ : Σ →
[0, +∞].
Then we have Hölder’s inequality and Minkowski’s inequality, respectively:
	
X
| f (x)g(x)|dμ(x) ≤

	
X
| f (x)|pdμ(x)
1/p
	
X
|g(x)|qdμ(x)
1/q
(2.7)

	
X
| f (x) + g(x)|pdμ(x)
1/p
≤

	
X
| f (x)|pdμ(x)
1/p
+

	
X
|g(x)|pdμ(x)
1/p
(2.8)
for any f, g : X →C measurable, p, q > 0 subject to 1/p + 1/q = 1 in the former,
p ≥1 in the latter [Rud86]. These inequalities are proved in two exercises at the end
of the chapter.
Let L p(X, Σ, μ), or henceforth L p(X, μ) by dropping the σ-algebra, be the
set of Σ-measurable maps f : X →C such that

X | f (x)|pdμ(x) < ∞. Using
Minkowski’s inequality one sees easily L p(X, μ) is a vector space under linear
composition of functions, and

56
2
Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
Pp( f ) :=

	
X
| f (x)|pdμ(x)
1/p
(2.9)
is a seminorm. Since Pp( f ) = 0 if and only if f = 0 a.e. for μ, in order to obtain a
norm (i.e., to have N3) we must identify the zero map and any function that differs
from it by a zero-measure set. To this end we deﬁne an equivalence relation on
L p(X, μ): f ∼g ⇔f −g is zero a.e. for μ. The quotient space L p(X, μ)/∼,
written L p(X, μ), inherits a vector-space structure over C from L p(X, μ) by setting:
[ f ] + [g] := [ f + g] and α[ f ] := [αf ] for any α ∈C, f, g ∈L p(X, μ).
It is not hard to show both left-hand sides are independent of the representatives
chosen in the equivalence classes on the right.
It can also be proved that L p(X, μ) is a Banach space for the norm:
||[ f ]||p :=

	
X
| f (x)|pdμ(x)
1/p
,
(2.10)
where f is any representative of [ f ] ∈L p(X, μ). We shall slightly abuse the notation
in the sequel, and write || f ||p instead of Pp( f ) when dealing with functions and not
equivalence classes.
If (X, Σ′, μ′) is the completion of (X, Σ, μ) (cf. Remark 1.47(1)), in general
L p(X, μ′) is larger than L p(X, μ). But if we pass to the quotient then L p(X, μ′) =
L p(X, μ) by way of Proposition 1.57.
Theorem 2.31 (Fischer–Riesz) If (X, Σ, μ) is a positive, σ-additive measure space,
the associated normed space L p(X, μ) is, for any 1 ≤p < +∞, a Banach space.
Proof Throughout this proof we shall omit the square brackets for the elements of
L p(X, μ), and identify cosets with functions (up to null sets). To prove the claim,
thanks to Proposition 2.17 it is sufﬁcient to verify that if the series +∞
n=0 fn in
L p(X, μ) converges absolutely, +∞
n=0 || fn||p ≤K < +∞, then +∞
n=0 fn = f a.e.
for some f ∈L p(X, μ) in the topology of || ||p. We will need the auxiliary sequence
gN(x) := N
n=1 | fn(x)|, N = 1, 2, . . .. By construction ||gN||p ≤N
n=1 || fn||p ≤
K for any N = 1, 2, . . .. We claim the limit limN→+∞gN(x) is ﬁnite for almost all
x ∈X. The sequence of integrable functions g p
N is non-negative and non-decreasing
by construction, and

X gN(x)pdμ(x) < K p for any N. By monotone convergence
the limit g p of g p
N exists, as a map in [0, +∞], because the sequence of the given
g p
N ≥0 is non-decreasing, and must have ﬁnite integral. Thus g p ≥0 is ﬁnite up to
possible zero-measure sets. As p ≥0, at points x ∈X where g(x)p < +∞we have
limN→+∞gN(x) = g(x) < +∞. By construction, where g(x) is ﬁnite the series
+∞
n=0 fn(x) converges absolutely. Therefore it converges to certain values f (x) ∈C.
Deﬁning f (x) = 0 where the series of fn does not converge, we obtain a series
+∞
n=0 fn that converges a.e. to a map f : X →C (measurable since limit, a.e., of
measurable functions, and, say, null on the zero-measure set where the series does not
converge). The map f belongs to L p(X, μ): if fN(x) := N
n fn(x), the sequence

2.1 Normed and Banach Spaces and Algebras
57
| fN|p is non-negative and

X | fN(x)|pdμ(x) < K p for any N. By Fatou’s lemma
f ∈L p(X, μ). Now we prove

X | fN(x) −f (x)|pdμ(x) →0 as n →+∞. Eas-
ily (see the footnote in Exercise 2.14) | fN(x) −f (x)|p ≤2p(| fN(x)|p + | f (x)|p).
Since, by construction, | fN|p + | f |p ≤|g|p + | f |p ∈L 1(X, μ), we can invoke the
dominated convergence theorem for the sequence | fN −f |p, known to converge a.e.
to 0, and obtain

X | fN(x) −f (x)|pdμ(x) →0 as n →+∞. We have thus proved
that the initial series +∞
n=0 fn, assumed absolutely convergent in L p(X, μ), satisﬁes
+∞
n=0 fn = f a.e. for the above f ∈L p(X, μ) in norm || ||p. This ends the proof.
⊓⊔
This argument implies a technical fact, extremely useful in the applications, that
deserves separate mentioning.
Proposition 2.32 Take 1 ≤p < +∞and let (X, Σ, μ) be a σ-additive, positive
measure space. If { fn}n∈N ⊂L p(X, μ) converges to f in || ||p as n →+∞, there
exists a subsequence { fnk}k∈N such that fnk →f a.e. for μ.
Proof The sequence { fn}n∈N is convergent hence Cauchy, and we can extract a subse-
quence { fnk}k∈N such that || fnk+1 −fnk|| ≤2−k. Deﬁne the telescopic sequence sk :=
fnk+1 −fnk. The series fn0 + +∞
k=1 sk is absolutely convergent, for +∞
k=1 ||sk||p <
+∞
k=1 2−k < +∞. As in the proof of Theorem 2.31, we conclude: (a) the sum s ∈
L p(X, μ) of the series exists, in the sense of || ||p convergence; (b) the series con-
verges pointwise to s almost everywhere, that is fn0(x) + 
k∈N sk(x) = s(x). Since
fn0(x) + +∞
k=0 sk(x) = fnk(x), what we have found is that fnk →s ∈L p(X, μ)
both pointwise μ-almost everywhere, and with respect to || ||p as well. But by
assumption fnk →f ∈L p(X, μ) with respect to || ||p, so || f −s||p = 0 and hence
f (x) = s(x) a.e. for μ. Eventually, then, fnk(x) →f (x) a.e. for μ.
⊓⊔
To wrap up the example notice that the Banach space L p(X, μ) is not, in general, an
algebra (for the usual pointwise product of functions), because the pointwise product
in L p(X, μ) does not normally belong to the space.
(7) With reference to example (6), consider the special case where X is not countable,
Σ is the power set of X and μ the counting measure:
μ(S) = number of elements of S ⊂X, with μ(S) = ∞if S is inﬁnite.
Given a measurable space Y, any map f : X →Y is measurable, and L p(X, μ) is
simply denoted by ℓp(X). Its elements are “sequences” {zx}x∈X of complex numbers,
labelled by X, such that:

x∈X
|zx|p < ∞,
where the sum is given by:
sup
⎧
⎨
⎩

x∈X0
|zx|p

Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
If X is countable, X = N or Z in particular, the above deﬁnition of sum of positive
numbers indexed by X is the usual sum of a series. For example, ℓp(N) is the space
of sequences {cn}n∈N ⊂C with:
+∞

n=0
|cn|p < +∞.
(8) Take a measure space (X, Σ, μ) and consider the class L ∞(X, μ) of complex
measurable maps f : X →C such that | f (x)| < M f a.e. for μ, for some M f ∈R
(depending on f ). Then L ∞(X, μ) has a natural structure of a vector space and of
a commutative algebra with unit (the function 1) if we use the ordinary product and
linear combinations as in example (2). We can equip L ∞(X, μ) with the seminorm:
P∞( f ) := ess sup| f |
deﬁned by the essential supremum of f ∈L ∞(X, μ):
ess sup| f | := inf {r ∈R | μ ({x ∈X | | f (x)| ≥r}) = 0} .
(2.11)
Naïvely speaking, the latter is the “smallest” upper bound of | f | when we ignore
what happens on zero-measure sets.
In particular (exercise):
P∞( f · g) ≤P∞( f )P∞(g) if f, g ∈L ∞(X, μ) .
As we did for L p, if we identify maps that differ only on zero-measure sets, we can
form the quotient space L∞(X, μ), with well-deﬁned product:
[ f ] · [g] := [ f · g] for f, g ∈L ∞(X, μ) .
Exactly as for the L p spaces, the seminorm P∞is (clearly) a norm on L∞(X, μ):
||[ f ]||∞:= ess sup| f | .
In analogy to the spaces L p, also L∞(X, μ) is a Banach space. Moreover, being
closed under products means it is a Banach algebra as well.
Theorem 2.33 (Fischer–Riesz, L∞case) If (X, Σ, μ) is a σ-additive, positive mea-
sure space, the associated normed space L∞(X, μ) is a Banach space.
Proof As customary, we indicate with f (no brackets) the generic element of
L∞(X, μ), and identify it with a function (up to null sets) when necessary. Let
{ fn}n∈N ⊂L∞(X, μ) be a Cauchy sequence for || ||∞. Deﬁne, for k, m, n ∈N,
sets Ak := {x ∈X | | fk(x)| > || fk||∞} and Bn,m := {x ∈X | | fn(x) −fm(x)| >
|| fn −fm||∞}. By construction E := ∪k∈N ∪n,m∈N Ak ∪Bn,m must have zero

2.1 Normed and Banach Spaces and Algebras
59
measure, and the sequence of the fn converges uniformly in X \ E to some f , which
is therefore bounded. Extend f to the entire X by setting it to zero on X \ E. Thus
f ∈L∞(X, μ) and || fn −f ||∞→0 as n →+∞.
⊓⊔
(9) Going back to example (8), in case Σ is the power set of X and μ the counting
measure, the space L∞(X, μ) is written simply ℓ∞(X). Its points are “sequences”
{zx}x∈X of complex numbers indexed by X such that supx∈X |zx| < +∞.
With the notation of example (2), ℓ∞(X) = L(X).
■
Notation 2.34 The literature prefers to use the bare letter f to indicate the equiva-
lence class [ f ] ∈L p(X, μ), 1 ≤p ≤∞. We shall stick to this convention when no
confusion arises.

2.2
Operators, Spaces of Operators, Operator Norms
With the next deﬁnition we introduce linear operators and linear functionals, whose
importance is paramount in the whole book. We shall assume from now on familiarity
with linear operators (matrices) on ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces, and we shall
freely use results from that theory without explicit mention.
Deﬁnition 2.35 (Operator and functional) Let X, Y be vector spaces over the same
ﬁeld K := R, C.
(a) T : X →Y is a linear operator (simply, an operator) from X to Y if it is linear:
T (αf + βg) = αT ( f ) + βT (g) for any α, β ∈K, f, g ∈X.
The set of linear operators from X to Y is indicated by L(X, Y).
If S ⊂X is a subspace such that T (S) ⊂S for some linear operator T : X →X,
we say that S is an invariant subspace for/under T (or shorter, T -invariant).
If X and Y are normed, B(X, Y) ⊂L(X, Y) is the subset of continuous operators.
In particular L(X) := L(X, X) and B(X) := B(X, X).
(b) T : X →K is a linear functional (a functional) on X if it is linear.
(c) We call the space X∗:= L(X, K)
the algebraic dual of X, whereas X′ :=
B(X, K) is the topological dual (the dual) of X, with K normed by the absolute
value.
Notation 2.36 Linear algebra textbooks usually write T u for T (u) when T : X →Y
is a linear operator and u ∈X, and we shall adhere to this convention.
■
If T, S ∈L(X, Y) and α, β ∈K, the linear combination αT + βS is the expected
map: (αT + βS)(u) := α(T u) + β(Su) for any u ∈X.
Thus αT + βS is still in L(X, Y). As linear combinations preserve continuity, we
have the following.

Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
Proposition 2.37 Let X, Y be vector spaces over the same ﬁeld K := R, or C.
Then L(X, Y), L(X), X∗, B(X, Y), B(X) and X′ are K-vector spaces.
Another fundamental notion we introduce is that of a bounded operator (or func-
tional). We begin with an elementary, yet important, fact.
Theorem 2.38 Let (X, || ||X), (Y, || ||Y) be normed spaces over the same ﬁeld K =
C or R and take T ∈L(X, Y).
(a) The following conditions are equivalent:
(i) there exists K ∈R such that ||T u||Y ≤K||u||X for all u ∈X;
(ii) supu∈X\{0}
||Tu||Y
||u||X < +∞.
(b) If either of (i), (ii) hold:
sup
 ||T u||Y
||u||X
 u ∈X \ {0}



K ∈R | ||T u||Y ≤K||u||X
for any u ∈X

.
Proof (a) Under (i), supu∈X\{0}
||Tu||Y
||u||X ≤K < +∞by construction. If (ii) holds, set
A := supu∈X\{0}
||Tu||Y
||u||X , and then K := A satisﬁes (i).
(b) Call I the greatest lower bound of the numbers K fulﬁlling (i). Since
sup
u∈X\{0}
||T u||Y
||u||X
≤K
we have supu∈X\{0}
||Tu||Y
||u||X ≤I. If the two sides of the equality to be proven are dif-
ferent, there exists K0 with supu∈X\{0}
||Tu||Y
||u||X < K0 < I, whence ||T u||Y < K0||u||X
for any u ̸= 0, so ||T u||Y ≤K0||u||X for all u ∈X. Therefore K0 satisﬁes (i), and
I ≤K0 by deﬁnition of I, in contradiction to K0 < I.
⊓⊔
Notation 2.39 We will start omitting subscripts in norms when the corresponding
spaces are clear from the context.
■
Deﬁnition 2.40 (Operator norm) Let X, Y be normed spaces over C or R. The
operator T ∈L(X, Y) is bounded if any one condition in Theorem 2.38(a) holds.
The number
||T || := sup
||u||̸=0
||T u||
||u|| .
(2.12)
is called (operator) norm of T .
Remarks 2.41 (1) From the deﬁnition of ||T ||, if T : X →Y is bounded then:
||T u|| ≤||T || ||u|| ,
for any u ∈X .
(2.13)
(2) The notion of bounded linear operator cannot clearly correspond to that of a
bounded function. That is because the image of a linear map, in a vector space,
cannot be bounded precisely because of linearity. Proposition 2.42 shows, though,

2.2 Operators, Spaces of Operators, Operator Norms
61
that it still makes sense to view “boundedness” in terms of the bounded image of an
operator, provided one restricts the domain to a bounded set.
■
The operator norm can be computed in alternative ways, which at times are useful
in proofs. In this respect,
Proposition 2.42 Let X, Y be normed spaces over C or R.
The operator T ∈L(X, Y) is bounded if and only if the right-hand side of any of
the identities below exists and is ﬁnite, in which case:
||T || = sup
||u||=1
||T u|| ,
(2.14)
||T || = sup
||u||≤1
||T u|| ,
(2.15)
||T|| = inf {K ∈R | ||T u|| ≤K||u||
for any u ∈X} .
(2.16)
Proof That T is bounded if and only if the right-hand side of (2.14) is ﬁnite, and the
validity of (2.14) too, follow from the linearity of T and N1.
As for the second line (2.15), the set of vectors u with ||u|| ≤1 contains those for
which ||u|| = 1, so sup||u||≤1 ||T u|| ≥sup||u||=1 ||T u||. On the other hand, ||u|| ≤1
implies ||T u|| ≤||T v|| for some v with ||v|| = 1 (any such v if u = 0, and v = u/||u||
otherwise). Hence sup||u||≤1 ||T u|| ≤sup||u||=1 ||T u||, from which sup||u||≤1 ||T u|| =
sup||u||=1 ||T u||, as claimed.
That T is bounded iff the right-hand side of (2.16) is ﬁnite, and (2.16) itself, are
consequences of Theorem 2.38(b).
⊓⊔
There is a relationship between continuity and boundedness of linear operators and
functionals, which makes boundedness very important. The following simple theo-
rem shows, amongst other things, that bounded operators are precisely the continuous
ones.
Theorem 2.43 Consider T ∈L(X, Y) with X, Y normed over the same ﬁeld R or
C.
The following are equivalent facts:
(i) T is continuous at 0;
(ii) T is continuous;
(iii) T is bounded.
Proof (i) ⇔(ii). Since continuity trivially implies continuity at 0, we will show (i)
⇒(ii). As (T u) −(T v) = T (u −v) we have (limu→v T u) −T v = limu→v(T u −
T v) = lim(u−v)→0 T (u −v) = 0 by continuity at 0.
(i) ⇒(iii). By the continuity at 0 there is δ > 0 such that ||u|| < δ implies ||T u|| < 1.
Fixing δ′ > 0 with δ′ < δ, if v ∈X \ {0}, then u = δ′v/||v|| has norm smaller than
δ, so ||T u|| < 1, i.e. ||T v|| < (1/δ′)||v||. Therefore Theorem 2.38(a) holds with
K = 1/δ′, and by Deﬁnition 2.40 T is bounded.

62

Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
(iii) ⇒(i). This is obvious: if T is bounded then ||T u|| ≤||T||||u||, hence the con-
tinuity at 0 follows.
⊓⊔
The name “norm” for ||T || is not accidental: the operator norm renders B(X, Y),
hence also B(X) and X′, normed spaces, as we shall shortly see. More precisely,
B(X, Y) is a Banach space if Y is Banach, so in particular X′ is always a Banach
space.
The next result is about the algebraic structure. Let us start by saying that the vector
spaces L(X) and B(X) are closed under composition of maps (since this preserves
continuity). Furthermore, it is immediate that L(X), B(X) satisfy the algebra axioms
A1, A2, A3 whenever the product of two operators is the composite. Therefore L(X)
and B(X) possess a natural structure of algebras with unit, where the unit is the
identity map I : X →X, and B(X) is a subalgebra in L(X).
The ﬁnal part of the theorem is a stronger statement, for it says B(X) is a normed
unital algebra for the operator norm, and a Banach algebra if X is Banach.
Theorem 2.44 Let X, Y be normed spaces over C, or R.
(a) The map || || : T →||T ||, where ||T || is as in (2.12), is a norm on B(X, Y).
(b) On the unital algebra B(X) the following properties hold, which turn it into a
normed algebra with unit:
(i) ||T S|| ≤||T ||||S||, T, S ∈B(X),
(ii) ||I|| = 1.
(c) If Y is complete, B(X, Y) is a Banach space.
In particular:
(i) if X is a Banach space, B(X) is a Banach algebra with unit (the identity
operator);
(ii) X′ is always a Banach space with the functionals’ norm, even if X is not
complete.
Proof (a) is a direct consequence of the deﬁnition of operator norm: properties N0,
N1, N2, N3 can be checked for the operator norm by using them on the norm of Y,
together with formula (2.14) and the deﬁnition of supremum.
(b) Part (i) is immediate from (2.13) and (2.14), and (ii) is straightforward if we use
(2.14).
Let us see to (c). We claim that Y complete ⇒B(X, Y) Banach. Take a Cauchy
sequence {Tn} ⊂B(X, Y) for the operator norm. By (2.13) we have
||Tnu −Tmu|| ≤||Tn −Tm||||u|| ,
As {Tn} is Cauchy, {Tnu} is too. Since Y is complete, for any given u ∈X there is a
vector in Y:
T u := lim
n→∞Tnu .
Because every Tn is a linear operator, so is X ∋u →T u. There remains to show
T ∈B(X, Y) and ||T −Tn|| →0 as n →∞.

As {Tn} is a Cauchy sequence, if ε > 0 then ||Tn −Tm|| ≤ε for n, m sufﬁciently
large, hence ||Tnu −Tmu|| ≤||Tn −Tm||||u|| ≤ε||u||. Therefore, since the norm is
continuous (it deﬁnes the topology of Y),
||T u −Tmu|| = || lim
n→+∞Tnu −Tmu|| =
lim
n→+∞||Tnu −Tmu|| ≤ε||u||
if m is big enough. From this estimate, since ||T u|| ≤||T u −Tmu|| + ||Tmu|| and
by (2.13), we have
||T u|| ≤(ε + ||Tm||)||u|| .
This proves T is bounded, so T ∈B(X, Y) by Theorem 2.43. Now, since ||T u −
Tmu|| ≤ε||u|| we also have ||T −Tm|| ≤ε where ε can be arbitrarily small so long
as m is large enough. That is to say, ||T −Tn|| →0 as n →∞.
The proof of subcases (i), (ii) is quick: (i) follows from B(X) = B(X, X), while
(ii) holds because X′ := B(X, K) and the ﬁeld K is a complete normed space.
⊓⊔
One last notion we need to deﬁne is conjugate or adjoint operators in normed spaces.
Beware that there is a different notion of conjugate operator speciﬁc to Hilbert spaces,
which we will address in the next chapter.
Take T ∈B(X, Y), with X, Y normed. We can build an operator T ′ ∈L(Y′, X′)
between the dual spaces (swapped), by imposing:
(T ′ f )(x) = f (T (x)) for any x ∈X, f ∈Y′.
This is well deﬁned, and for every f ∈Y′ it produces a function T ′ f : X →C that
is linear by construction, because it coincides with the composite of linear maps f
and T . Furthermore, T ′ : Y′ ∋f →T ′ f ∈X′ is linear:
(T ′(af + bf ))(x) = (af + bg)(T (x)) = af (T (x)) + bg(T(x))
= a(T ′ f )(x) + b(T ′g)(x) for any x ∈X .
Eventually, T ′ is bounded, in the obvious sense:
|(T ′ f )(x)| = | f (T (x))| ≤|| f ||||T||||x|| ,
and so:
||T ′ f || = sup
||x||=1
|T ′ f (x)| ≤|| f ||||T|| .
Taking, on the left, the supremum over the collection of f ∈Y′ with || f || = 1 gives:
||T ′|| ≤||T || .

Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
After proving the Hahn–Banach theorem, we will show that ||T ′|| = ||T || if X, Y
are Banach spaces.
Deﬁnition 2.45 Let X, Y be normed spaces over the same ﬁeld C, or R, and T ∈
B(X, Y). The conjugate, or adjoint operator to T , in the sense of normed spaces,
is the operator T ′ ∈B(Y′, X′) deﬁned by:
(T ′ f )(x) = f (T (x)) for any x ∈X, f ∈Y′.
(2.18)
Remark 2.46 The map B(X, Y) ∋T →T ′ ∈B(Y′, X′) is linear:
(aT + bS)′ = aT ′ + bS′
for any a, b ∈C, T, S ∈B(X, Y).
■
Before we move on to the examples, we shall state an elementary result, very impor-
tant in the applications, about the uniqueness of extensions of bounded operators and
functionals deﬁned on dense subsets.
Proposition 2.47 (Extension of bounded operators) Let X, Y be normed spaces over
C, or R, with Y Banach. Suppose S ⊂X is a dense subspace of X and T : S →Y is
a bounded linear operator on S. Then
(a) there is a unique bounded linear operator ˜T : X →Y such that ˜T↾S= T ;
(b) || ˜T|| = ||T||.
Proof (a) Given x ∈X, there is a sequence {xn} in S converging to x. By hypothesis
||T xn −T xm|| ≤K||xn −xm|| for K < +∞. Since xn →x, the sequence of the xn
is Cauchy, and so is T xn. But Y is complete so there exists ˜T x := limn→∞T xn ∈Y.
The limit depends only on x and not upon the sequence in S used to approximate: if
S ∋zn →x then by the norms’ continuity
|| lim
n→+∞T xn −
lim
n→+∞T zn|| =
lim
n→+∞||T xn −T zn|| ≤
lim
n→+∞K||xn −zn|| = K||x −x|| = 0 .
Clearly ˜T↾S= T , i.e. ˜T extends T , by choosing for any x ∈S the constant sequence
xn := x, that tends to x trivially. The linearity of ˜T is straightforward from the
deﬁnition. Eventually, taking the limit as n →+∞of ||T xn|| ≤K||xn|| gives
|| ˜T x|| ≤K||x||, so ˜T is bounded. About uniqueness: if U is another bounded exten-
sion of T on X, then for any x ∈X, ˜T x −Ux = limn→+∞( ˜T xn −Uxn) by continu-
ity, where the xn belong to S (dense in X). As ˜T↾S= T = U↾S, the limit is trivial and
gives ˜T x = Ux for all x ∈X, i.e. ˜T = U.
(b) Let x ∈X and suppose {xn} ⊂S converges to x: then
|| ˜T x|| =
lim
n→+∞||T xn|| ≤
lim
n→+∞||T ||||xn|| = ||T ||||x|| ,

so || ˜T|| ≤||T||. But since S ⊂X and ˜T↾S= T ,

⊓⊔
Examples 2.48 (1) Complex measures (see Sect.1.4.8) allow to construct every
bounded linear functional on C0(X), where X is locally compact and Hausdorff.
Toseethis,consideralocallycompactHausdorffspaceX equippedwithacomplex
measure μ deﬁned on the Borel σ-algebra of X. We know that the normed algebra
(Cc(X), || ||∞) completes to the Banach algebra (C0(X), || ||∞) of maps that vanish
at inﬁnity (Example 2.29(4)). Under the assumptions made, then, ||μ|| := |μ|(X),
where the positive, σ-additive and ﬁnite measure |μ| is the total variation of μ (cf.
Sect.1.4.8). Easily then, || || is a norm on the space of complex Borel measures on
X. Moreover, if f ∈C0(X),
|Λμ f | ≤||μ|||| f ||∞
where Λμ f :=
	
X
f dμ ,
and, as usual, || f ||∞= supx∈X | f (x)|.
Consequently, every complex Borel measure μ deﬁnes an element Λμ in the (topo-
logical) dual of C0(X). Riesz’s theorem for complex measures [Rud86] guarantees
that this is a general fact, and even more.
In order to state it, recall that
Deﬁnition 2.49 (Regular complex Borel measure) A complex Borel measure μ is
called regular if the ﬁnite positive Borel measure given by the total variation |μ| is
regular (Deﬁnition 1.81).
Theorem 2.50 (Riesz’s theorem for complex measures) Let X be a locally compact
Hausdorff space, and Λ : C0(X) →C a continuous linear functional. Then there
exists a unique regular complex Borel measure μΛ such that, for every f ∈C0(X):
Λ( f ) =
	
X
f dμΛ .
Moreover, ||Λ|| = ||μΛ||.
Since every regular complex Borel measure determines a bounded functional on
C0(X) by integration, Riesz’s theorem has the following consequence.
Corollary 2.51 If X is locally compact and Hausdorff, the topological dual C0(X)′
of the Banach space (C0(X), || ||∞) is identiﬁed with the real vector space of regular
complex Borel measures μ on X, endowed with norm ||μ|| := |μ|(X). The function
mapping μ to the functional Λμ : C0(X) →R, with Λμ f :=

X f dμ, is an isomor-
phism of normed spaces.

Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
Also note, Cc(X) being dense in C0(X), that a continuous functional on the former
determines a unique functional on the latter, so Riesz’s theorem characterises as well
continuous functionals on Cc(X) for the sup norm.
Furthermore, suppose every open set in X is the countable union of compact
sets (as in Rn, where each open set is the union of countably many closed balls of
ﬁnite radius). Then the word regular can be dropped in Theorem 2.50, by way of
Proposition 1.60, because compact sets have ﬁnite measure with respect to the ﬁnite
|μ|. In particular we have:
Theorem 2.52 (Riesz’s theorem for complex measures on Rn) Let K ⊂Rn be a
compact set and Λ : C(K) →C a continuous linear functional. Then there is a
unique complex Borel measure μΛ on K such that
Λ( f ) =
	
K
f dμΛ
for any f ∈C(K). Additionally, μΛ is regular.
(2) Another nice class of dual Banach spaces is that of L p spaces, cf. Example
2.29(6). In this respect [Rud86],
Proposition 2.53 Let (X, Σ, μ) be a positive measure space. If 1 ≤p < +∞the
dual to the Banach space L p(X, μ) is Lq(X, μ), where 1/p + 1/q = 1, in the sense
that the linear map:
Lq(X, μ) ∋[g] →Λg where Λg( f ) :=
	
X
f g dμ , f ∈L p(X, μ)
is an isomorphism Lq(X, μ) →(L p(X, μ))′ of normed spaces.
In the same way the dual to L1(X, μ) is identiﬁed with L∞(X, μ), because the
linear map
L∞(X, μ) ∋[g] →Λ′
g where Λ′
g( f ) :=
	
X
f g dμ , f ∈L1(X, μ)
is an isomorphism L∞(X, μ) →(L1(X, μ))′ of normed spaces.

The Fundamental Theorems of Banach Spaces
This section is devoted to the most prominent theorems on normed and Banach
spaces, in their simplest versions, and we will study their main consequences. These
arethetheoremsofHahn–Banach,Banach–Steinhausandtheopenmappingtheorem.
The applications of the theorem of Banach–Steinhaus call forth several kinds of
topologies, which play a major role in QM when the domain space is the Hilbert space

of the theory, bounded operators are (certain) observables, and the basic features of
thequantumsystemassociatedtomeasurementprocessesareasubclassoforthogonal
projectors. In order to pass with continuity from the algebra of observables to that
of projectors we need topologies that are weaker than the standard one. This sort of
issues, that we shall address later, lead to the notion of von Neumann algebra (of
operators).
2.3.1
The Hahn–Banach Theorem and Its Immediate
Consequences
The ﬁrst result we present is the celebrated Hahn–Banach theorem, which deals with
extending a continuous linear functional from a subspace to the ambient space in a
continuous and norm-preserving way. More elaborated and stronger versions can be
found in [Rud91]. We shall restrict to the simplest situation possible.
First of all, we remark that if X is normed and M ⊂X is a subspace, the norm of
X restricted to M deﬁnes a normed space. In this sense we can talk of continuous
operators and functionals on M, meaning they are bounded for the induced norm.
Theorem 2.54 (Hahn–Banach theorem for normed spaces) Let M be a subspace
(not necessarily closed) in a normed space X over K = C or R.
If g : M →K is a continuous linear functional, there exists a continuous linear
functional f : X →K such that f ↾M= g and || f ||X = ||g||M.
Proof We shall follow the proof of [Rud86]. Start with K = R. If g = 0, an extension
as required is f = 0. So let us suppose g ̸= 0 and without loss of generality set
||g|| = 1. To build the extension f we take x0 ∈X \ M and call
M1 := {x + λx0 | x ∈M , λ ∈R} .
If we set g1 : M1 →R to be
g1(x + λx0) = g(x) + λν
for any given ν ∈R, we obtain an extension of g to M1. We claim ν can be taken so
that ||g1|| = 1. For this it sufﬁces to have ν such that:
|g(x) + λν| ≤||x + λx0|| ,
for any x ∈M and λ ∈R \ {0}.
(2.19)
Substitute −λx to x and divide (2.19) by |λ|, obtaining the equivalent relation:
|g(x) −ν| ≤||x −x0|| ,
for any x ∈M.
(2.20)

68
2
Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
Set
ax := g(x) −||x −x0|| and bx := g(x) + ||x −x0||.
(2.21)
Inequality (2.20), hence ||g1|| = 1, holds if ν satisﬁes ax ≤ν ≤bx for all x ∈M.
So it is enough to prove that the intervals [ax, bx], x ∈M, have a common point; in
other words, that for all x, y ∈M:
ax ≤by .
(2.22)
But:
g(x) −g(y) = g(x −y) ≤||x −y|| ≤||x −x0|| + ||y −x0||
and (2.22) follows from (2.21). Hence, we managed to ﬁx ν so that ||g1|| = 1.
Now consider the family P of pairs (M′, g′) where M′ ⊃M is a subspace in X
and g′ : M′ →R is a linear extension of g with ||g′|| = 1. The family is not empty
since (M1, g1) belongs in it. We can deﬁne a partial order on P (see Appendix A,
also for the sequel) by setting (M′, g′) ≤(M′′, g′′) if M′′ ⊃M′, g′′ extends g′ and
||g′|| = ||g′′|| = 1. It is easy to show that any totally ordered subset of P admits
an upper bound in P. Then Zorn’s lemma provides a maximal element in P, say
(M1, f 1). Now we must have M1 = X, for otherwise there would exist x0 ∈X \ M1,
and using the initial argument we could construct a non-trivial, norm-preserving
extension f 1 to the subspace generated by x0 and M1, contradicting maximality.
Therefore f := f 1 is the required extension.
Before passing to the case K = C we need a lemma.
Lemma 2.55 On a complex vector space Y
(a) if u(x) = Re g(x) for all x ∈Y for some complex linear functional g : Y →C,
the map u : Y →R is a real linear functional on Y, and:
g(x) := u(x) −iu(ix) for any x ∈Y;
(2.23)
(b) if u : Y →R is a real linear functional on Y and g is deﬁned by (2.23), then g
is a complex linear functional on Y;
(c) if Y is normed and g, u are related by (2.23), then ||g|| = ||u||.
Proof (a) are (b) are proved simultaneously by direct computation. As for (c), under
the assumptions made: |u(x)| ≤|g(x)| =

|u(x)|2 + |u(ix)|2, so ||u|| ≤||g||. On
the other hand taking x ∈Y, there is α ∈C with |α| = 1 such that αg(x) = |g(x)|.
Consequently |g(x)| = g(αx) = u(αx) ≤||u|| ||αx|| = ||u|| ||x|| and ||g|| ≤||u||.
⊓⊔
Now back to the main proof. If u : M →R is the real part of g, then g(x) = u(x) −
iu(ix) and ||g|| = ||u|| by the lemma. From the real case seen earlier we know there
exists a linear extension U : X →R of u with ||U|| = ||u|| = ||g||. Therefore if we
put

2.3 The Fundamental Theorems of Banach Spaces
69
f (x) := U(x) −iU(ix) ,
for any x ∈X,
f : X →C extends g to X, and || f || = ||U|| = ||g||.
⊓⊔
Here is one of the most useful corollaries to Hahn–Banach. We remind that the
topological dual B(X, C) of a normed space is indicated by X′.
Corollary 2.56 (to the Hahn–Banach theorem) Let X be a normed space over K =
C,orR,andﬁx x0 ∈X, x0 ̸= 0.Thenthereexists f ∈X′,|| f || = 1,suchthat f (x0) =
||x0||.
Proof Choose M := {λx0 | λ ∈K} and g : λx0 →λ||x0||. Let f ∈X′ denote the
boundedfunctionalextending g accordingtoHahn–Banach.Byconstruction f (x0) =
g(x0) = ||x0|| and || f ||X = ||g||M = 1.
⊓⊔
An immediate consequence of this is a statement about the norm of the conjugate
operator T ′ ∈B(Y′, X′) to T ∈B(X, Y) (cf. Deﬁnition 2.45).
Proposition 2.57 If T ∈B(X, Y), with X, Y normed over C or R, then:
||T ′|| = ||T || .
Proof In general we have (cf. (2.17)) ||T || ≥||T ′||, so we need only prove ||T|| ≤
||T ′||. Take x ∈X and T x ̸= 0, deﬁne y0 :=
T x
||T x|| ∈Y. Clearly ||y0|| = 1, and by
Corollary 2.56 there is g ∈Y′ such that ||g|| = 1, g(y0) = 1 hence g(T x) = ||T x||.
But:
||T x|| = g(T x) = |(T ′g)(x))| ≤||T ′g|| ||x|| ≤||T ′|| ||g|| ||x|| = ||T ′|| ||x|| ,
so eventually ||T|| ≤||T ′|| as required.
⊓⊔
Next comes another fact, with important consequences for Banach algebras.
Corollary 2.58 (to the Hahn–Banach theorem) Let X ̸= {0} be a normed space over
C or R.
Then the elements of X′ separate X, i.e. for any x1 ̸= x2 in X there exists f ∈X′
for which f (x1) ̸= f (x2).
Proof It sufﬁces to have x0 := x1 −x2 in Corollary 2.56, for then f (x1) −f (x2) =
f (x1 −x2) = ||x1 −x2|| ̸= 0.
⊓⊔
Take x ∈X and f ∈X′, || f || = 1; then | f (x)| ≤1||x|| and
sup{| f (x)| | f ∈X′ , || f || = 1} ≤||x|| .
Corollary 2.56 allows to strengthen this fact by showing
sup{| f (x)| | f ∈X′ , || f || = 1} = max{| f (x)| | f ∈X′ , || f || = 1} = ||x||

directly. This may not seem so striking at ﬁrst, but has a certain weight when com-
paring inﬁnite-dimensional to ﬁnite-dimensional normed spaces.
From the elementary theory of ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces X, the algebraic
dual of the algebraic dual (X∗)∗has the nice property of being naturally isomorphic
to X. The isomorphism is the linear function mapping x ∈X to the linear functional
I(x) on X∗deﬁned by (I(x))( f ) := f (x) for all f ∈X∗.
In inﬁnite dimensions I identiﬁes X only to a subspace of (X∗)∗, not the whole
(X∗)∗in general. Is there a similar general statement about topological duals of
inﬁnite-dimensional normed spaces?
Note (X′)′ is the dual to a normed space (X′ with the operator norm). Consequently
(X′)′ is a normed space, under the operator norm.
Let us go back to the natural linear transformation I : X →(X′)∗mapping x ∈X
to I(x) ∈(X′)∗, where the linear function I(x) : X′ →K is given by
(I(x))( f ) := f (x)
for any f ∈X′ and x ∈X .
This is well deﬁned, since I(x) is a linear functional on X′ so that I(x) ∈(X′)∗. Now
sup{| f (x)| | f ∈X′ , || f || = 1} = ||x||
implies: (1) I(x) is a bounded functional, so it belongs to (X′)′, and (2) ||I(x)|| =
||x||. Therefore the linear mapping I : X →(X′)′ is an isometry, in particular injec-
tive. This gives an isometric inclusion X ⊂(X′)′ under the linear map I : X →(X′)′.
Overall we have proved:
Corollary 2.59 (to the Hahn–Banach theorem) Let X be a normed space over C or
R. The linear map I : X →(X′)′:
(I(x))( f ) := f (x) for any x ∈X and f ∈X′,
(2.24)
is an isometry, and X is thus identiﬁed isometrically with a subspace of (X′)′.
There are inﬁnite-dimensional examples where X does not ﬁll (X′)′, and these justify
the next notion.
Deﬁnition 2.60 A normed space X over C or R is reﬂexive if the isometry (2.24) is
onto (an isomorphism of normed spaces).
Otherwise said, X is reﬂexive when X and (X′)′ are isometrically isomorphic under
the natural map I. In Chap.3 we will show that Hilbert spaces are reﬂexive.
Example 2.61 The Banach spaces L p(X, μ) of Examples 2.29 are reﬂexive for
1 < p < ∞. The proof is straightforward: L p(X, μ)′ = Lq(X, μ) for 1/p + 1/q =
1, and swapping q with p gives Lq(X, μ)′ = L p(X, μ). Hence: (L p(X, μ)′)′ =
L p(X, μ).

2.3 The Fundamental Theorems of Banach Spaces

2.3.2
The Banach–Steinhaus Theorem or Uniform
Boundedness Principle
Let us get to the second core result, the theorem of Banach–Steinhaus, and present
the simplest formulation and consequences. It is also known as uniform boundedness
principle, because it essentially – and remarkably – declares that pointwise equi-
boundedness implies uniform boundedness for families of operators on a Banach
space.
Theorem 2.62 (Banach–Steinhaus) Let X be a Banach space, Y a normed space
deﬁned over the same ﬁeld, C or R. If {Tα}α∈A ⊂B(X, Y) is a family of operators
such that:
sup
α∈A
||Tαx|| < +∞for any x ∈X ,
then there exists K ≥0 that bounds the family uniformly:
||Tα|| ≤K
for any α ∈A .
Proof The proof relies on ﬁnding an open ball Bρ(z) ⊂X for which there is M ≥0
with ||Tα(x)|| ≤M for all α ∈A and any x ∈Bρ(z). In fact, since x = (x + z) −z,
we would then have:
||Tα(x)|| ≤||Tα(x + z)|| + ||Tα(z)|| ≤2M ,
for any α ∈A, x ∈Bρ(0) ,
so ||Tα|| ≤2M/ρ for all α ∈A, and the claim would follow.
We shall prove that Bρ(z) and M exist by contradiction. If such a ball did not exist,
for some arbitrary open Br0(x0), there would be x1 ∈Br0(x0) for which ||Tα1(x1)|| >
1, with α1 ∈A. As Tα1 is continuous, we could ﬁnd a second open ball Br1(x1) with
Br1(x1) ⊂Br0(x0) and 0 < r1 < r0 such that ||Tα1(x)|| ≥1, provided x ∈Bα1(x1).
This recipe can be iterated to give rise to a sequence of open balls in X, {Brk(xk)}k∈N,
satisfying:
(i) Brk(xk) ⊃Brk+1(xk+1),
(ii) rk →0 as k →+∞,
(iii) for every k ∈N there is αk ∈A such that ||Tαk(x)|| ≥k if x ∈Brk(xk).
Now, (i) and (ii) imply the sequence {xk}k∈N is Cauchy, so it converges to some y ∈X
by completeness, and by construction y ∈∩k∈NBrk(xk). But (iii) tells ||Tαk(y)|| ≥k
for all k ∈N, contradicting the assumption that supn∈N ||Tαx|| < +∞for any x ∈X.
⊓⊔
Here is a straightforward and useful corollary.
Corollary 2.63 (to the Banach–Steinhaus theorem) Under the assumptions of the
Banach–Steinhaus theorem the family of operators {Tα}α∈A is equicontinuous: given
any ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that if ||x −x′|| < δ for x, x′ ∈X, then ||Tαx −
Tαx′|| < ε for any α ∈A.

72

Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
Proof Set Cγ := {x ∈X | ||x|| ≤γ }, for any γ > 0. Fix ε > 0, so we must ﬁnd the
δ > 0 of the conclusion. By Banach–Steinhaus and Proposition 2.42, ||Tαx|| ≤K <
+∞for any α ∈A and x ∈C1. If K = 0 there is nothing to prove, so assume K > 0.
Choose δ > 0 for which Cδ ⊂Cε/K. Then if ||x −x′|| < δ, we have K(x −x′)/ε ∈
CKδ/ε ⊂C1 and so:
||Tαx −Tαx′|| = ||Tα(x −x′)|| = ε

And here is another consequence about topological duals.
Corollary 2.64 (to the Banach–Steinhaus theorem) Let X be a normed space over
C or R. If S ⊂X is weakly bounded, i.e.
for any f ∈X′ there exists c f ≥0 such that | f (x)| ≤c f for all x ∈S,
then S is bounded in the norm of X.
Proof Consider the elements x ∈S ⊂X as functionals in the dual (X′)′ to X′ (using
the isometry I : X →(X′)′ of Corollary 2.59). The family S ⊂(X′)′ of functionals
on X′ is bounded on every f ∈X′, since by assumption |x( f )| = | f (x)| ≤c f (where
we have written x for I(x)). Since X′ is complete the theorem of Banach–Steinhaus
guarantees sup{|x( f )| | || f || = 1} ≤K < +∞for all x ∈S. But I is an isometry,
so ||x|| ≤K < +∞for all x ∈S.
⊓⊔
2.3.3
Weak Topologies. ∗-Weak Completeness of X′
To state the last corollary to Banach–Steinhaus we need to introduce a new section
on general topology and apply it to the operator spaces encountered so far. This will
allow to see different types of convergence for sequences of operators, useful for
the applications. They will help us prove a simple and useful result known as the
Banach–Alaoglu theorem.
We begin with basic facts concerning convexity.
Deﬁnition 2.65 A subset ∅̸= K ⊂X in a vector space is convex when:
λx + (1 −λ)y ∈K
for any λ ∈[0, 1] and x, y ∈K.
A point e ∈K is extremal if it cannot be written as:
e = λx + (1 −λ)y
for some λ ∈(0, 1) and x, y ∈K \ {e}.

2.3 The Fundamental Theorems of Banach Spaces
73
It should be clear that the intersection of convex sets is convex, because the segment
joining two points lying in the intersection belongs to each set. So we are lead to the
notion of convex hull.
Deﬁnition 2.66 The convex hull of a subset E in a vector space X is the convex set
co(E) :=

{K ⊃E | K ⊂X , K convex}.
Let us go back open balls deﬁned through seminorms.
Notation 2.67 Take δ > 0, a seminorm p on the vector space X over K = C or R,
and a point x ∈X. We denote by Bp,δ(x) the open ball associated to the seminorm
p, centred at x and of radius δ:
Bp,δ(x) := {z ∈X | p(z −x) < δ} .
If x = 0 we will just write Bp,δ instead of Bp,δ(0).
If A ⊂X, B ⊂X, x ∈X and α, β ∈K, we will also abbreviate:
x + β A := {x + βu | u ∈A} and αA + βB := {αu + βv | u ∈A , v ∈B} .
■
Immediately, then, for δ > 0 the balls Bp,δ are:
(i) convex, since x, y ∈Bp,δ implies trivially (1 −λ)x + λy ∈Bp,δ with λ ∈
[0, 1],
(ii) balanced, i.e. λx ∈Bp,δ if x ∈Bp,δ and 0 ≤λ ≤1,
(iii) absorbing, i.e. x ∈X implies λ−1x ∈Bp,δ for some λ > 0.
All these properties are patently invariant under intersections. Hence also intersec-
tions of balls centred at the origin but deﬁned by different seminorms enjoy the
property.
Deﬁnition 2.68 Let P := {pi}i∈I be a family of seminorms on the vector space X
over K = C or R. The topology T (P) on X generated, or induced, by P, is the
unique topology admitting as basis (Deﬁnition 1.1) the collection:
x +

Bpi1,δ1 ∩· · · ∩Bpin ,δn

(2.25)
for any choice of: centres x ∈X, numbers n = 1, 2, . . ., indices i1, . . . , in ∈I and
radii δ1 > 0, . . . δn > 0.
The pair (X, P), where X is simultaneously a vector space with topology induced
by the seminorms P and a topological space, is called a locally convex space.
Let us put it differently: T (P) has as open sets ∅and all possible unions of sets
of type (2.25), with any centre x ∈X, for any n = 1, 2, . . ., any index i1, . . . , in ∈I
and any δ1 > 0, . . . δn > 0.

Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
Remark 2.69 If P reduces to a single norm, the corresponding topology is the
topology induced by a norm discussed at the beginning of the chapter. If this sole
element is a seminorm, we still have a topology, with the crucial difference that the
Hausdorff property might be no longer valid.
■
Since adding vectors and multiplying vectors by scalars are continuous operations in
any seminorm (the proof is the same as what we gave for a norm), they are continuous
in the topology generated by a family P of seminorms as well. This means the vector
space structure is compatible with the topology generated by P. A vector space with
a compatible topology as above is a topological vector space. A locally convex space
is therefore a topological vector space.
Keeping Deﬁnition 1.13 in mind we can prove the next fact without effort.
Proposition 2.70 A sequence {xn}n∈N ⊂X converges to x0 ∈X in the topology
T (P) if and only if pi(xn −x0) →0, for all pi ∈P, as n →+∞.
Our ﬁrst example of topology induced by seminorms arises from the dual X′ of a
normed space.
Deﬁnition 2.71 If X is a normed space, the weak topology on X is the topology
induced by the collection of seminorms p f on X:
p f (x) := | f (x)| with x ∈X
for f ∈X′.
Consider pairs of normed spaces and the corresponding sets of operators between
them. Using the topology induced by seminorms we can deﬁne certain “standard”
topologies on the vector spaces L(X, Y), B(X, Y) and the dual X′, thus making them
locally convex topological vector spaces. One such topology (and the corresponding
dual one) is already known to us, namely the topology induced by the operator norm.
Deﬁnition 2.72 Let X, Y be normed spaces over K = C or R.
(a) Deﬁne on L(X, Y) (respectively B(X, Y)) the following operator topologies.
(i) The topology induced by the family of seminorms px, f :
px, f (T ) := | f (T (x))| with T ∈L(X, Y)(B(X, Y)),
for given x ∈X and f ∈Y′, is called weak topology on L(X, Y) (B(X, Y));
(ii) The topology induced by the seminorms px:
px(T ) := ||T (x)||Y
with T ∈L(X, Y)(B(X, Y)),
for given x ∈X, is the strong topology on L(X, Y) (B(X, Y));
(iii) The topology induced on B(X, Y) by the operator norm (2.12) is the uniform
topology on B(X, Y).

2.3 The Fundamental Theorems of Banach Spaces
75
(b) In case Y = K (we are talking about X′) the uniform topology of (iii) goes under
the name of (dual) strong topology of X′, and the topologies of (i) and (ii), now
coinciding, are called ∗-weak topology of X′. The ∗-weak topology on X′ is thus
induced by the seminorms p∗
x:
p∗
x( f ) := | f (x)| with f ∈X′
for a given x ∈X.
Remarks 2.73 (1) It is not hard to see that the open sets, in a normed space, of the
weak topology are also open for the standard topology, not vice versa. Likewise, in
L(X, Y), open sets in the weak topology are open for the strong topology but not
conversely. We can rephrase this better by saying that the standard topology on X and
the strong topology on L(X, Y) are ﬁner than the corresponding weak topologies.
In the same way, when talking of operator spaces it is not hard to show that the
uniform topology is ﬁner than the strong topology.
For dual spaces an analogous property obviously holds: the strong topology is
ﬁner than the ∗-weak topology.
(2) Proposition 2.70 has a number of immediate consequences:
Proposition 2.74 Take {xn}n∈N ⊂X with X normed. Then xn →x ∈X, n →+∞,
in the weak topology if and only if:
f (xn) →f (x) ,
as n →+∞, for any f ∈X′.
Proposition 2.75 If {Tn}n∈N ⊂L(X, Y) (o B(X, Y)) and T ∈L(X, Y) (resp.
B(X, Y)), then Tn →T , n →+∞, in weak topology if and only if:
f (Tn(x)) →f (T (x)) ,
as n →+∞, for any x ∈X, f ∈Y′.
Proposition 2.76 Tn →T , n →+∞, in the strong topology if and only if:
||Tn(x) −T (x)||Y →0 ,
as n →+∞, for any x ∈X.
Now it is clear that:
(a) Convergence of a sequence in a normed space X in the standard sense (for the
norm topology) implies weak convergence (convergence in the weak topology).
(b) Uniform convergence of a sequence of operators in B(X, Y) (in the uniform
topology) implies strong convergence (for the strong topology).
(c) Strong convergence of a sequence of operators in L(X, , Y) or B(X, Y) implies
weak convergence.
(3) Proposition 2.70 also gives:
Proposition 2.77 Let { fn}n∈N ⊂X′ be a sequence, and take a functional f ∈X′.
Then fn →f , n →+∞, in the ∗-weak topology if and only if:

76
2
Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
fn(x) →f (x) ,
as n →+∞for any chosen x ∈X.
Now we also know that the strong convergence of a sequence of functionals of X′
(for the dual strong topology) implies ∗-weak convergence.
(4) We can put on X′ yet a further weak topology, by viewing X′ as acted upon by
(X′)′. The seminorms inducing the topology are
ps( f ) := |s( f )|
for any s ∈(X′)′. If X is not reﬂexive, this weak topology does not coincide, in
general, with the ∗-weak topology seen above, because X is identiﬁed with a proper
subspace in (X′)′, and so the seminorms of the ∗-weak topology are fewer than the
weak topology ones. The weak topology is ﬁner than the ∗-weak one: a weakly open
set is ∗-weakly open, but the converse may not hold. Analogously, weak convergence
of sequences in X′ implies ∗-weak convergence, not the other way around.
■
Notation 2.78 To distinguish strong limits from weak limits in operator spaces, it
is customary to use these special symbols:
T = s- lim Tn
means T is the limit of the sequence of operators {Tn}n∈N in the strong topology;
the same notation goes if the operators are functionals and the topology is the dual
strong one. Similarly,
T = w- lim Tn
denotes the limit in the weak topology of the sequence of operators {Tn}n∈N, and one
writes
f = w∗- lim fn
if f is the limit of the sequence { fn}n∈N in the ∗-weak topology.
■
All the theory learnt so far eventually enables us to prove the last corollary to Banach–
Steinhaus. If X is normed we know X′ is complete in the strong topology, see Theorem
2.44(c)(ii). We can also prove completeness, as explained below, for the ∗-weak
topology too, as long as X is a Banach space.
Corollary 2.79 (to the Banach–Steinhaus theorem) If X is a Banach space over
K = C, or R, then X′ is ∗-weak complete: if { fn}n∈N ⊂X′ is such that { fn(x)}n∈N is
a Cauchy sequence for any x ∈X, then there exists f = w∗-lim fn ∈X′.
Proof The ﬁeld over which X is deﬁned is complete by assumption, so for any x ∈
X there is f (x) ∈K with fn(x) →f (x). Immediately f : X ∋x →f (x) deﬁnes
a linear functional. To end the proof we have to prove f is continuous. For any
x ∈X the sequence fn(x) is bounded (as Cauchy), so Banach–Steinhaus implies
| fn(x)| ≤K < +∞for all x ∈X with ||x|| ≤1. Taking the limit as n →+∞gives

2.3 The Fundamental Theorems of Banach Spaces
77
| f (x)| ≤K if ||x|| = 1, hence || f || ≤K < +∞. Therefore, by Theorem 2.43 f is
continuous.
⊓⊔
As last topic of this section, related to the topological facts just seen, we state and
prove a useful technical tool, the theorem of Banach–Alaoglu: according to it, the
unit ball in X′, deﬁned via the natural norm of X′, is compact (Deﬁnition 1.19) in
the ∗-weak topology of X′.
Theorem 2.80 (Banach–Alaoglu) Let X be a normed space over C. The closed unit
ball B := { f ∈X′ | || f || ≤1} in the dual X′ is compact in the ∗-weak topology.
Proof For any x ∈X deﬁne Bx := {c ∈C | |c| ≤||x||} ⊂C. As Bx is obviously
compact, Tychonoff’s Theorem 1.25 forces P := ×x∈X Bx to be compact in the prod-
uct topology. A point p in P is, for each x ∈X, just a complex number p(x) with
|p(x)| ≤||x||. Elements in P are therefore functions p : X →C (not necessarily
linear!) such that |p(x)| ≤||x|| for any x ∈X. By construction B ⊂P, and the
topology induced by P on B is precisely the ∗-weak topology, as the deﬁnitions
conﬁrm. To ﬁnish the proof we need to prove B is closed, because closed subsets in
a compact space are compact. Suppose, then, B ∋pn →p ∈P as n →+∞, in the
topology of P. Since |p(x)| ≤||x||, to prove that p ∈B it sufﬁces to show that p is
linear. This is evident by arguing pointwise: if a, b ∈C and x, y ∈X, then
p(ax + by) =
lim
n→+∞pn(ax + by) = a
lim
n→+∞pn(x) + b
lim
n→+∞pn(y) = ap(x) + bp(y) ,
and the proof is concluded.

2.3.4
Excursus: The Theorem of Krein–Milman, Locally
Convex Metrisable Spaces and Fréchet Spaces
With this part we take a short break to digress on important properties of locally
convex spaces in relationship to the issue of metrisability.
Let X be a locally convex space. In general, the topology induced by a seminorm
or a family of seminorms P = {pi}i∈I on X will not be Hausdorff. It is easy to see
the Hausdorff property holds if and only if ∩i∈I p−1
i (0) is the null vector in X. This
happens in particular if at least one pi is a norm.
Locally convex Hausdorff spaces have this very relevant feature: not only extremal
elements always exist in convex and compact subsets, but a convex subset is actually
characterised by its extremal points. This is the content of the known Krein–Milman
theorem, which we only state.

78
2
Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
Theorem 2.81 (Krein–Milman) Let X be a locally convex Hausdorff space and
K ⊂X a compact convex set. Then
(a) the set EK of extremal elements of K is not empty.
(b) K = co(EK), where the bar denotes the closure in the ambient topology of X.
And now to metrisable spaces. Let us recall a notion that should be familiar from
basic courses.
Deﬁnition 2.82 A metric space is a set M equipped with a function d : M × M →
R, called distance or metric, such that, for every x, y, z ∈M:
D1. d(x, y) = d(y, x),
D2. d(x, y) ≥0, and d(x, y) = 0 ⇔x = y,
D3. d(x, z) ≤d(x, y) + d(y, x).
Remarks 2.83 (1) Property D1 is known as symmetry of the metric, D2 is called
positive deﬁniteness and D3 is the triangle inequality.
(2) Any normed space (X, || ||) (hence also Rn and Cn) admits a natural metric
structure (X, d) by setting d(x, x′) := ||x −x′||, x, x′ ∈X. Then clearly
d(x + z, y + z) = d(x, y) for any x, y, z ∈X ,
and the distance d is translation-invariant.
■
Generally speaking the structure of a metric space is much simpler than that of
a normed space, because the former lacks the vector space operations. We have,
nevertheless, the following notion, in complete analogy to normed spaces.
Deﬁnition 2.84 Given a metric space (M, d), an open (metric) ball centred at x of
radius r > 0 is the set:
Bδ(x) := {y ∈M | d(x, y) < δ} .
(2.26)
Like normed spaces, metric spaces have a natural topology whose open sets are the
empty set ∅and the unions of open metric balls with arbitrary centres and radii.
Deﬁnition 2.85 Let (M, d) be a metric space.
(a) A ⊂M is open if A = ∅or A is the union of open balls.
(b) The metric topology of M is the norm topology of the open sets of (a).
Remarks 2.86 (1) Exactly as for normed spaces, by checking the axioms we see that
the metric topology is an honest topology, with basis given by open metric balls. The
metric topology is trivially Hausdorff, as in normed spaces.
(2) If the metric space (X, d) is separable, i.e. it has a dense countable subset S ⊂X,
then it is second countable: it has a countable basis B for the topology. The latter is
the family of open balls centred on S with rational radii. One can prove the converse
holds too [KoFo99]:

2.3 The Fundamental Theorems of Banach Spaces
79
Proposition 2.87 A metric space is second countable if and only if it is separable.
(3) In a normed space (X, || ||) the open balls deﬁned by || || coincide with the
open balls of the norm distance d(x, x′) := ||x −x′||. Thus the two topologies of X,
viewed either as a normed space or as metric space, coincide.
(4) The previous remark applies in particular to Rn and Cn, which are both metric
spaces if we use the Euclidean or standard distance:
d((x1, . . . , xn), (y1, . . . , yn)) :=




n

k=1
|xk −yk|2 .
As observed above, the balls deﬁned by the standard distance on Rn and Cn are pre-
cisely those associated to the standard norm (1.2) generating the standard topology.
Therefore the topology deﬁned by the Euclidean distance on Rn and Cn is just the
standard topology.
(5) The metric spaces Rn and Cn are complete, for they are complete as normed
spaces and the metric is the norm distance.
■
Like normed spaces, metric spaces too admit a characterisation of continuity equiv-
alent to 1.16.
Deﬁnition 2.88 Given metric spaces (M, dM), (N, dN), a map f : M →N is con-
tinuous at x0 ∈M if for any ε > 0 there is δ > 0 such that dN( f (x), f (x0)) < ε
whenever dM(x, x0) < δ.
A function f : M →N is continuous if it is continuous at every point in M.
The concept of a convergent sequence (Deﬁnition 1.13) specialises in a metric space,
as it did in a normed space.
Deﬁnition 2.89 In a metric space (M, d) a sequence {xn}n∈N ⊂M converges to a
point x ∈M, the limit of the sequence:
xn →x
as n →+∞or
lim
n→+∞xn = x ,
if, for any ε > 0 there is Nε ∈R such that d(xn, x) < ε for n > Nε, i.e.
lim
n→+∞d(xn, x) = 0 .
It turns out, here as well, that convergent sequences in the metric topology are Cauchy
sequences (see below), but not conversely.
Deﬁnition 2.90 Let (M, d) be a metric space.
(a) A sequence {xn}n∈N ⊂M is a Cauchy sequence if for any ε > 0 there is Nε ∈R
such that d(xn, xm) < ε when n, m > Nε.
(a) (M, d) is complete if every Cauchy sequence converges somewhere in the space.

Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
A technically relevant problem is to tell whether a topological space, especially a
locally convex space, admits a distance function whose metric topology coincides
with the pre-existing one (note that in general distances do not exist if the topology
is induced by seminorms). When that happens the space is called metrisable.
Going back to topological vector spaces, one can prove that any locally convex
space (X, P) satisfying:
(a) P = {pn}n=1,2,..., i.e. P is countable,
(b) ∩n=1,2,... p−1
n (0) = {0}
is not just Hausdorff but even metrisable: the seminorm topology coincides with the
metric topology of (X, d), provided we pick d : X × X →R+ suitably. One such
choice is:
d(x, y) :=
+∞

n=1
1
2n
pn(x −y)
1 + pn(x −y)
(which is invariant under translations). This is not the only possible distance that
recovers the seminorm topology of X. Multiplying d by a given positive constant,
for instance, will give a distance yielding the same topology as d.
A Fréchet space is a locally convex space X whose topology is Hausdorff, induced
by a ﬁnite or countable number of seminorms, and complete as a metric space (X, d).
A sequence {xn}n∈N ⊂X is Cauchy for a distance d in a locally convex metrisable
space X if and only if it is Cauchy for every seminorm p generating the topology:
for every ε > 0 there is N (p)
ε
∈R such that p(xn −xm) < ε whenever n, m > N (p)
ε
.
Consequently,completenessdoesnotactuallydependonthedistanceusedtogenerate
the locally convex topology.
Fréchet spaces, which we will not treat in this book, are of the highest interest in
theoretical and mathematical physics as far as quantum ﬁeld theories are concerned.
Banach spaces are simple instances of Fréchet spaces, of course.
Example 2.91 A good example of a Fréchet space is the Schwartz space. To deﬁne
it we need some notation, which will come in handy at the end of Chap.3 as well.
Points in Rn will be denoted by letters and their components by subscripts, as in
x = (x1, . . . , xn).
A multi-index is an n-tuple α = (α1, . . . , αn), αi = 0, 1, 2, . . ., and |α| is con-
ventionally the sum |α| := n
i=1 αi. Moreover,

Let C∞(Rn) denote the complex vector space of smooth complex functions on Rn
(differentiable with continuity inﬁnitely many times). The Schwartz space S (Rn),
seen as complex vector space, is the subspace in C∞(Rn) of functions f that vanish
at inﬁnity, together with every derivative, faster than any inverse power of |x| :=

The maps pN : S (Rn) →R+ are seminorms, and clearly satisfy ∩N∈N p−1
N (0) =
{0} because p0 = || ||∞is a norm. Therefore S (Rn), with the topology induced
by the seminorms {pN}N∈N, becomes a locally convex space. It is easy to show
that S (Rn) is a Fréchet space [Rud91]. The points in the dual S (R)′, i.e. the
linear functionals S (Rn) →C that are continuous for the topology generated by
the seminorms {pN}N∈N, are the famous Schwartz distributions.

Baire’s Category Theorem and Its Consequences:
The Open Mapping Theorem and the Inverse Operator
Theorem
We wish to discuss a general theorem about Banach spaces, the open mapping the-
orem, which counts among its consequences the continuity of inverse operators.
To prove these facts we shall introduce as little as possible on Baire spaces.
Deﬁnition 2.92 Let (X, T ) be a topological space and S ⊂X a subset.
(a) The interior Int(S) of S is the set:
Int(S) := {x ∈X | ∃A ⊂X , A open and x ∈A ⊂S} .
(b) S is nowhere dense if Int(S) = ∅.
(c) S is a set of the ﬁrst category, or a meagre set, if it is the countable union of
nowhere dense sets.
(d) S is a set of the second category, or non-meagre, if it is not of the ﬁrst category.
The following are immediate to prove.
(1) Countable unions of sets of the ﬁrst category are of the ﬁrst category.
(2) If h : X →X′ is a homeomorphism, S ⊂X is of the ﬁrst/second category if and
only if h(S) is of the ﬁrst/second category respectively.
(3) If A ⊂B ⊂X and B is of the ﬁrst category in X, then A is of the ﬁrst category.
(4) If B ⊂X is closed and Int(B) = ∅, then B is of the ﬁrst category in X.
We have the following important result.
Theorem 2.93 (Baire’s category theorem) Let (X, d) be a complete metric space.
(a) If {Un}n∈N is a countable family of open dense subsets in X, then ∩n∈NUn is dense
in X.
(b) X is of the second category.
Proof (a) Let A ⊂X be open. If U0 ∩A = ∅, then z ∈A admits an open neigh-
bourhood disjoint from U0, and hence not dense in X. Therefore U0 ∩A is open
(intersection of open sets) and non-empty. Then there is an open metric ball Br0(x0)

82
2
Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
of radius r0 > 0 and centre x0 ∈X (2.26) such that Br0(x0) ⊂U0 ∩A. We may
repeat the procedure with Br0(x0) replacing A, U1 replacing U0, to ﬁnd an open
ball Br1(x1) with Br1(x1) ⊂U1 ∩Br0(x0). Iterating, we construct a countable collec-
tion of open balls Brn(xn) with 0 < rn < 1/n, such that Brn(xn) ⊂Un ∩Brn+1(xn−1).
Since xn ∈Brm(xm) for n ≥m, the sequence {xn}n∈N is Cauchy. And since X is
complete, xn →x ∈X as n →+∞. By construction x ∈Brn−1(xn−1) ⊂Brn(xn) ⊂
· · · ⊂U0 ∩A ⊂A for any n ∈N. Hence x ∈A ∩Un for every n ∈N, and so
(∩n∈NUn) ∩A ̸= ∅for every open subset A ⊂X. This implies ∩n∈NUn is dense
in X, for it meets every open neighbourhood of any point in X.
(b) Assume {Ek}k∈N is a collection of nowhere dense sets Ek ⊂X. If Vk is the
complement of Ek, it is open (its complement is closed) and dense in X (it is open
and the complement’s interior is empty). Part (a) then tells ∩k∈NVn ̸= ∅, so X ̸=
∪k∈NEk by taking complements. A fortiori then X ̸= ∪k∈NEk, so X is not of the ﬁrst
category.
⊓⊔
Remarks 2.94 (1) Baire’s category theorem states, among other things, that any
collection, ﬁnite or countable, of dense open sets in a complete metric space always
has non-empty (dense) intersection. In the ﬁnite case it sufﬁces to adapt the statement
to Un = Um for some N ≤n, m.
(2) Baire’s theorem holds when X is a locally compact Hausdorff space. The ﬁrst
part is proved in analogy to the previous situation [Rud91], the second is identical.
(3) Baire’s theorem applies, obviously, to Banach spaces, using the norm
distance.
■
We can pass to the open mapping theorem. Remember that a map f : X →Y between
normed spaces (or topological spaces) is open if f (A) is open in Y whenever A ⊂X
is open. As usual, B(Z)
r
(z) denotes the open ball of radius r and centre z in the normed
space (Z, || ||Z).
Theorem 2.95 (Banach–Schauder’s open mapping theorem) Let X and Y be Banach
spaces over C or R. If the operator T ∈B(X, Y) is surjective, then
T (B(X)
1 (0)) ⊃B(Y)
δ
(0) for δ > 0 small enough .
(2.27)
As a consequence, T is an open map.
Proof Deﬁne in X the open ball Bn := B(X)
2−n(0) at the origin, of radius 2−n. We will
show there is an open neighbourhood W0 of the origin 0 ∈Y with:
W0 ⊂T (B1) ⊂T (B0) ,
(2.28)
which will imply (2.27).
To prove (2.28), note B1 ⊃B2 −B2 (from now on we use Notations 2.67), so
T (B1) ⊃T (B2) −T (B2)

2.3 The Fundamental Theorems of Banach Spaces

and T (B1) ⊃T (B2) −T (B2). On the other hand, since A + B ⊃A + B, A, B ⊂Y
with Y normed (prove it as exercise), we have:
T (B1) ⊃T (B2) −T (B2) ⊃T (B2) −T (B2) .
(2.29)
The ﬁrst inclusion of (2.28) is therefore true if T (B2) has non-empty interior: if
z ∈Int(T (B2)) then z ∈A ⊂T (B2)) with A open, so that 0 ∈W0 := A −A ⊂
T (B2) −T (B2) ⊂T (B1) with W0 open.
To show Int(T (B2)) ̸= ∅, notice that the assumptions imply
Y = T (X) =
+∞

k=1
kT (B2) ,
(2.30)
because B2 is an open neighbourhood of 0. But Y is of the second category, so at least
one kT (B2) is of the second category (otherwise Y would be of the ﬁrst category,
which is impossible by the second statement in Baire’s category Theorem 2.93, for
Y is complete). Since y →ky is a homeomorphism of Y, T (B2) is of the second
category in Y. Hence the closure of T (B2) has non-empty interior, proving one
inclusion of (2.28).
For the other inclusion (the second from the left), we build a sequence of elements
yn ∈Y inductively. Fix y1 ∈T (B1), suppose that yn is in T (Bn) for n ≥1 and let
us deﬁne yn+1 as follows. What was proved for T (B1) holds for T (Bn+1) too, so
T (Bn+1) contains an open neighbourhood of the origin. Now:
 
yn −T (Bn+1)
!
∩T (Bn) ̸= ∅,
(2.31)
implying there exists xn ∈Bn such that:
T (xn) ∈yn −T (Bn+1) .
(2.32)
Deﬁne: yn+1 := yn −T xn and note it belongs to T (Bn+1). This is the inductive step.
Since ||xn|| < 2−n, n = 1, 2, . . ., the sum x1 + · · · + xn gives a Cauchy sequence
converging to some x ∈X by completeness, and ||x|| < 1. Hence x ∈B0. Since:
m

n=1
T xn =
m

n=1
(yn −yn+1) = y1 −ym+1 ,
(2.33)
and because ym+1 →0 as m →+∞(by continuity of T ), we conclude y1 = T x ∈
T (B0). Now as y1 was generic in T (B1), that proves the second inclusion of (2.28)
and ends the ﬁrst part.
As for the second statement, (2.27) and the linearity of T imply that the image
under T of any open ball B(X)
ε (x) = x + εB1(0), centred at any x ∈X, contains
the open ball in Y centred at T x: B(Y)
δε (0) := T x + εB(Y)

small). Therefore the image under T of an open set A = ∪x∈AB(X)
εx (x) is open in Y:
T (A) = ∪x∈AB(Y)
δεx (T x). This means T is open.
⊓⊔
The most important elementary corollary of this theorem is without doubt Banach’s
inverse operator theorem for Banach spaces (there is a version for complete metric
vector spaces as well).
Theorem 2.96 (Banach’s inverse operator theorem) Let X and Y be Banach spaces
over C or R, and suppose T ∈B(X, Y) is injective and surjective. Then
(a) T −1 : Y →X is bounded, i.e. T −1 ∈B(Y, X);
(b) there exists c > 0 such that:
||T x|| ≥c||x|| ,
for any x ∈X.
(2.34)
Proof (a) That T −1 is linear is straightforward, for we need only prove it is continu-
ous. As T is open, the pre-image under T −1 of an open set in X is open, making T −1
continuous. (b) Since T −1 is bounded, there is K ≥0 with ||T −1y|| ≤K||y||, for any
y ∈Y. Notice that K > 0, for otherwise T −1 = 0 would not be invertible. For any
x ∈X we set y = T x. Substituting in ||T −1y|| ≤K||y|| gives back, for c = 1/K,
relation (2.34).
⊓⊔
2.3.6
The Closed Graph Theorem
Now we discuss a very useful theorem in operator theory, known as the closed graph
theorem.
Notation 2.97 (1) If X is a vector space and ∅̸= X1, . . . , Xn ⊂X, then:
< X1, . . . , Xn >
will denote the linear span of the sets Xi, i.e. the vector subspace of X containing
all ﬁnite linear combinations of elements of any Xi.
(2) Take ∅̸= X1, . . . , Xn subspaces of a vector space X. Then
Y = X1 ⊕· · · ⊕Xn
denotes the direct sum Y ⊂X of the Xi, i.e.:
(i) Y =< X1, · · · , Xn > (so Y is a subspace in X) and
(ii) Xi ∩X j = {0} for any pair i, j = 1, . . . , n, i ̸= j.
As is well known, (i) and (ii) are equivalent to demanding
x ∈Y ⇒x = x1 + · · · + xn
with xk ∈Yk determined uniquely by x, k = 1, . . . , n.

2.3 The Fundamental Theorems of Banach Spaces
85
(3) If X1, . . . , Xn are vector spaces over the same ﬁeld K = C or R, we may furnish
X1 × · · · × Xn with the structure of a K-vector space by:
α(x1, . . . , xn) := (αx1, . . . , αxn) and (x1, . . . , xn) + (y1, . . . , yn) := (x1 + y1, . . . , xn + yn)
for any α ∈K, (x1, . . . , xn), (y1, . . . , yn) ∈X1 × · · · × Xn. Calling
ΠXk : (x1, . . . , xk−1, xk, xk+1, . . . , xn) →(0, . . . , 0, xk, 0, . . . , 0)
the kth canonical projection, the vector space built on X1 × · · · × Xn coincides
with Ran(ΠX1) ⊕· · · ⊕Ran(ΠXn). As each Xk is naturally identiﬁed with the cor-
responding Ran(ΠXk), we will write X1 ⊕· · · ⊕Xn to denote the natural vector
space X1 × · · · × Xn above, even when the Xk are not all contained in one common
space.
■
To prove the closed graph theorem we need some preliminaries. First of all, if (X, NX)
and (Y, NY) are normed spaces over K = C, or R, we can consider X ⊕Y, in the
Notation 2.97(3). The space X ⊕Y has the product topology of X and Y, seen in
Deﬁnition 1.10. The operations of the vector space X ⊕Y are continuous in the
product topology, as one proves with ease (the proof is the same as the one used for
the operations on a normed space). And the canonical projections ΠX : X ⊕Y →X,
ΠY : X ⊕Y →Y are continuous in the product topology on the domain and the
topologies of X and Y on the codomains, another easy fact.
The product topology of X ⊕Y admits compatible norms: there exist norms on
X ⊕Y inducing the product topology. One possibility is:
||(x, y)|| := max{NX(x), NY(y)}
for any (x, y) ∈X ⊕Y .
(2.35)
That this norm generates the product topology, i.e. open sets are unions of products
of open balls in X and Y, is proved as follows. Take the open neighbourhood of
(x0, y0) product of two open balls B(X)
δ
(x0) × B(Y)
μ (y0) in X and Y respectively. The
open ball in X ⊕Y
{(x, y) ∈X × Y | ||(x, y) −(x0, y0)|| < min{δ, μ}/2}
centred at (x0, y0) is contained in B(X)
δ
(x0) × B(Y)
μ (y0). Vice versa, the product
B(X)
δ
(x0) × B(Y)
δ
(y0), to which (x0, y0) belongs, is contained in the open ball
{(x, y) ∈X × Y | ||(x, y) −(x0, y0)|| < ε}
centred at (x0, y0), if ε > δ. This implies that unions of products of metric balls in X
and Y are unions of metric balls for norm (2.35), and conversely too. Hence the two
topologies coincide and the proof ends.

Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
Immediately we can prove (X ⊕Y, || ||) is a Banach space if both (X, NX) and
(Y, NY) are Banach. (By Proposition 2.105, proved later, this fact will guarantee that
any norm generating the product topology makes X ⊕Y a Banach space.) In fact let
{(xn, yn)} be a Cauchy sequence in X ⊕Y. Then {xn} and {yn} are both Cauchy in X
and Y respectively, by the above deﬁnition of norm on X ⊕Y. Call x ∈X and y ∈Y
the limits of those sequences, which exist for X and Y are Banach spaces. If ε > 0,
there are positive integers Nx and Ny satisfying
||(x, y) −(xn, yn)|| < ε
if n > max{Nx, Ny}. Therefore (xn, yn) →(x, y) as n →+∞in the norm topology
of X ⊕Y, and the latter is a Banach space.
Deﬁnition 2.98 Let X, Y be normed spaces on C or R. One says T ∈L(X, Y) is
closed if the graph of the operator T ,
G(T ) := {(x, T x) ∈X ⊕Y | x ∈X} , ,
is a closed subspace in the product topology.
Equivalently, T is closed iff for any converging sequence {xn}n∈N ⊂X such that
{T xn}n∈N converges in Y, we have:
lim
n→∞T (xn) = T ( lim
n→∞xn) .
The last equivalence relies on a general fact: a set (G(T) in our case) is closed if and
only if it coincides with its closure, if and only if it contains its limit points. Spelling
out this fact in terms of the product topology gives our proof. We are ready for the
closed graph theorem.
Theorem 2.99 (Closed graph theorem) Let (X, || ||X) and (Y, || ||Y) be Banach
spaces over K = C.
Then T ∈L(X, Y) is bounded if and only if it is closed.
Proof Suppose T is bounded. Then it is banally closed by the deﬁnition of closed
operator. Assume conversely that T is closed. Consider the linear bijective map M :
G(T ) ∋(x, T x) →x ∈X. By hypothesis G(T ) is a closed subspace in the Banach
space X ⊕Y, hence it becomes Banach for the restricted norm || || of (2.35). The
latter’s deﬁnition implies ||M(x, T x)||X = ||x||X ≤||(x, T x)||, so M is bounded.
Banach’s bounded-inverse theorem tells M−1 : X →G(T ) ⊂X ⊕Y is bounded.
As the canonical projection ΠY : X ⊕Y →Y is continuous, we infer that the linear
map ΠY ◦M−1 : x →T x is continuous, hence bounded.
⊓⊔

2.4 Projectors
87
2.4
Projectors
Using the closed graph theorem we deﬁne a class of continuous operators, called
projectors. This notion plays the leading role in formulating QM when the normed
space is a Hilbert space.
Deﬁnition 2.100 (Projector) Let (X, || ||) be a normed space over C or R. The
operator P ∈B(X) is a projector if it is idempotent, i.e.
P P = P .
(2.36)
The target M := P(X) is called projection space of P, and we say P projects
onto M.
Projectors are naturally associated to a direct sum decomposition of X into a pair of
closed subspaces.
Proposition 2.101 Let P ∈B(X) be a projector onto the normed space (X, || ||).
(a) If Q : X →X is the linear map such that
Q + P = I ,
(2.37)
then Q is a projector and:
P Q = QP = 0 ,
(2.38)
where 0 is the null operator (transforming any vector into the null vector 0 ∈X).
(b) The projection spaces M := P(X) and N := Q(X) are closed subspaces satisfy-
ing:
X = M ⊕N .
(2.39)
Proof (a) Q is continuous as sum of continuous operators. Moreover QQ = (I −
P)(I −P) = I −2P + P P = I −2P + P = I −P = Q,
P Q = P(I −P) =
P −P P = P −P = 0 and (I −P)P = P −P P = P −P = 0.
(b) If P(xn) →y as n →+∞, by continuity of P we have P P(xn) →P(y). Using
Eq. (2.36) we rephrase this as P(xn) →P(y), whence y = P(y) by uniqueness of
the limit (X is Hausdorff). So, y ∈M implies y ∈M(⊂M), and M = M is closed.
The same argument proves N is closed. That M, N are subspaces is immediate from
the linearity of P and Q. If we take x ∈X, then
x = P(x) + Q(x) ,
and X = < M, N >. To ﬁnish we need to have M ∩N = {0}. Pick x ∈M ∩N. Then
x = P(x), so x = Q(x) by (2.36) (x ∈M implies x = Pz for some z ∈X, but then
Px = P Pz = Pz = x). Using Q on x = Px, and recalling x = Qx, gives x =
Q(x) = QP(x) = 0 by (2.38), i.e. x = 0.
⊓⊔

Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
The closed graph theorem explains that Proposition 2.101 can be reversed, provided
we further suppose the ambient space is Banach.
Proposition 2.102 Let (X, || ||) be a Banach space, M, N ⊂X closed subspaces
such that X = M ⊕N. Consider the functions P : X →M and Q : X →N that map
x ∈X to the respective elements in M and N according to X = M ⊕N. Then
(a) P and Q are projectors onto M and N respectively.
(b) Properties (2.37) and (2.38) hold.
Proof By assumption x ∈X decomposes as x = uM + uN for certain uM ∈M, uN ∈
N, and the sum is unique once the subspaces are ﬁxed. Uniqueness, and the fact
that M and N are closed under linear combinations, imply that P : x →uM and
Q : x →uN are linear, P P = P and QQ = Q. Note that P(X) = M and Q(X) = N
by construction. Moreover (2.37) holds since X = < M, N >, while (2.38) is true by
M ∩N = {0}. To ﬁnish we need to show P and Q are continuous. Let us prove P is
closed, and the closed graph theorem will then force continuity. The strategy for Q
is analogous. So let {xn} ⊂X be a sequence converging to x ∈X, and such that also
{Pxn} converges in X. We claim that
Px =
lim
n→+∞Pxn .
As N is closed,
N ∋Qxn = xn −Pxn →x −lim
n→+∞Pxn = z ∈N .
So we have
x =
lim
n→+∞Pxn + z ,
with z ∈N, but limn→+∞Pxn ∈M as well, because M is closed and Pxn ∈M for
all n. On the other hand we know that
x = Px + Qx.
Since the decomposition is unique, necessarily
Px =
lim
n→+∞Pxn
and z = Qx. Therefore P is closed and so continuous.
⊓⊔

2.5 Equivalent Norms

2.5
Equivalent Norms
One interesting consequence of Banach’s inverse operator theorem is a criterion to
establish when two norms on a complete vector space (for both) induce the same
topology. Before stating the criterion (Proposition 2.105), let us prepare the ground.
The section will end with the proof that all norms on a vector space of ﬁnite dimension
are equivalent, and make the space Banach.
Deﬁnition 2.103 Two norms N1, N2 deﬁned on one vector space X (over C or R)
are equivalent if there are constants c, c′ > 0 such that:
cN2(x) ≤N1(x) ≤c′N2(x) ,
for any x ∈X.
(2.40)
Remarks 2.104 (1) Note how (2.40) is equivalent to the similar inequality obtained
by swapping N1, N2, and writing 1/c′, 1/c in place of c, c′ respectively.
(2) By this observation, it is straightforward that if a given normed space is complete,
then it is complete for any equivalent norm.
(3) Two equivalent norms on a vector space generate the same topology, as is easy
to prove. The next proposition discusses the converse.
(4) Equivalent norms deﬁne an equivalence relation on the space of norms on a given
vector space. The proof is immediate from the deﬁnitions.
■
Proposition 2.105 Let X be a vector space over C or R. The norms N1 and N2 on
X are equivalent if and only if the identity map I : (X, N2) ∋x →x ∈(X, N1) is a
homeomorphism (which is to say, the metric topologies generated by the norms are
the same).
Proof It sufﬁces to prove the ‘if’ part, for the sufﬁcient condition is trivial by deﬁni-
tion of equivalent norms. If I is a homeomorphism it is continuous at the origin, and in
particular the unit open ball (for N1) centred at 0 must contain an entire open ball (for
N2)at0 ofsmallenoughradiusδ > 0.Thatistosay, N2(x) ≤δ ⇒N1(x) < 1.Inpar-
ticular, for x ̸= 0, N2(δx/N2(x)) ≤δ, so N1(δx/N2(x)) < 1, i.e. δN1(x) ≤N2(x).
For x = 0 the equality is trivial. Hence we have proved that there is c′ = 1/δ > 0
for which N1(x) ≤c′N2(x), for any x ∈X. The other half of (2.40) is similar if we
swap spaces.
⊓⊔
Proposition 2.106 Let X be a vector space over C or R and suppose the norms N1,
N2 both make X Banach. If there is a constant c > 0 such that:
cN2(x) ≤N1(x)
for any x ∈X, the norms are equivalent.
Proof Consider the identity I : x →x, a linear and continuous map when thought of
as I : (X, N1) →(X, N2), since N2(x) ≤(1/c)N1(x) for all x ∈X. Banach’s inverse
function theorem, part (b), guarantees the existence of c′ > 0 such that N1(x) ≤
c′N2(x) for all x ∈X. Then N1 and N2 satisfy (2.40).
⊓⊔

Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
The important, and ﬁnal, proposition in this section holds also on real vector spaces
(writing R instead of C in the proof).
Proposition 2.107 Let X be a C-vector space of ﬁnite dimension. Then all norms
are equivalent, and any one deﬁnes a Banach structure on X.
Proof We can simply study Cn, given that any complex vector space of ﬁnite dimen-
sion n is isomorphic to Cn. Owing to remarks (2) and (4) above, it is sufﬁcient to
prove that any norm on Cn is equivalent to the standard norm. Keep in mind the
fact, known from elementary analysis, that the standard Cn is complete, so any other
equivalent norm makes it a Banach space, by Remark 2.104(2).
Let N be a norm on Cn and e1, · · · , en the canonical basis. If x = 
i xiei and y =

i yiei are generic points in Cn, from properties N0, N2 and N1 (see the deﬁnition
of norm) we have
0 ≤N(x −y) ≤
n

i=1
|xi −yi|N(ei) ≤Q
n

i=1
|xi −yi| ,
where Q := 
i N(ei). At the same time, trivially, if || · || is the standard norm then
|x j −y j| ≤max{|xi −yi| | i = 1, 2, · · · , n} ≤




n

i=1
|xi −yi|2 = ||x −y|| ,
whence
0 ≤N(x −y) ≤nQ||x −y|| .
This shows N is continuous in the standard topology. If S := {x ∈Cn | ||x|| = 1},
and N ′ is a second norm on Cn that is continuous in the standard topology, then the
map
S ∋x →f (x) := N(x)
N ′(x)
is continuous, being a quotient of continuous maps with non-zero denominator. But
S is compact in the standard topology, so f has a minimum m and a maximum M.
In particular, M ≥m > 0 because N, N ′ are strictly positive on S and m, M are
attained at suitable points xm, xM in S. By construction
mN ′(x) ≤N(x) ≤M N ′(x) ,
for any x ∈S .
We claim that this inequality actually holds for any x ∈Cn. Write x = λx0 with
x0 ∈S and λ ≥0. Multiplying by λ ≥0 the inequality, evaluating it at x0 and using
property N1 gives precisely:
mN ′(x) ≤N(x) ≤M N ′(x) for any x ∈Cn.

2.5 Equivalent Norms
91
Now by choosing N ′ := || · || we conclude that any norm on Cn is equivalent to the
standard one.
⊓⊔
2.6
The Fixed-Point Theorem and Applications
In this last section of the chapter, we present an elementary theorem with crucial
consequences in analysis, especially in the theory of differential equations: the ﬁxed-
point theorem. We will state it for complete metric spaces and then examine it on
Banach spaces.
2.6.1
The Fixed-Point Theorem of Banach–Caccioppoli
Let us start with a deﬁnition about metric spaces, cf. Deﬁnition 2.82.
Deﬁnition 2.108 Let (M, d) be a metric space. A map G : M →M is a contraction
(map) in case there exists a real number λ ∈[0, 1) for which:
d(G(x), G(y)) ≤λd(x, y) for any x, y ∈M .
(2.41)
Remember that normed spaces (X, || ||) are metric spaces once we specify the norm
distance d(x, y) := ||x −y|| (and the metric topology induced by d coincides with
the topology induced by || ||, as we saw in Sect.2.3.4). Hence we can specialise the
deﬁnition to normed spaces.
Deﬁnition 2.109 Let (Y, || ||) be a normed space and X ⊂Y a subset (possibly
the whole Y). A function G : X →X is a contraction if there exists a real number
λ ∈[0, 1) for which:
||G(x) −G(y)|| ≤λ||x −y|| for x, y ∈X .
(2.42)
Remarks 2.110 (1) Note that the value λ = 1 is explicitly excluded.
(2) The demand of (2.41) implies immediately that any contraction is continuous in
the metric topology of (M, d).
Similarly, (2.42) tells that any contraction on the set X is continuous in the induced
norm topology of (Y, || ||).
(3) We stress that, in Deﬁnition 2.109, (a) the function G is not requested to be linear,
and (b) X is not necessarily a subspace of Y, but only a subset. Linear structures play
no interesting role.
■
Let us state and prove the ﬁxed-point theorem (of Banach and Caccioppoli) for metric
spaces.

92
2
Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
Theorem 2.111 (Fixed-point theorem for metric spaces) Let G : M →M be a con-
traction on the complete metric space (M, d). Then there exists a unique element
z ∈M, called ﬁxed point, such that
G(z) = z .
(2.43)
If G : M →M is not a contraction, but the n-fold composite Gn = G ◦· · · ◦G is a
contraction for a given n = 1, 2, . . ., then G admits a unique ﬁxed point.
Proof Let us begin by proving the existence of z. Consider, for x0 ∈M arbitrary, the
sequence deﬁned recursively by xn+1 = G(xn). We claim this is a Cauchy sequence,
and that its limit is a ﬁxed point of G. Without loss of generality we may suppose
m ≥n.
If m = n, trivially d(xm, xn) = 0. If m > n we employ the triangle inequality
repeatedly to get:
d(xm, xn) ≤d(xm, xm−1) + d(xm−1, xm−2) + · · · + d(xn+1, xn) .
(2.44)
The generic summand on the right equals
d(x p+1, x p) = d(G(x p), G(x p−1)) ≤λd(x p, x p−1) = λd(G(x p−1), G(x p−2))
≤λ2d(x p−1, x p−2)
≤· · · ≤λpd(x1, x0) .
Hence, for p = 1, 2, . . . we have d(x p+1, x p) ≤λpd(x1, x0). Inserting the latter
inequality in the right-hand side of (2.44) produces the estimate:
d(xm, xn) ≤d(x1, x0)
m−1

p=n
λp = d(x1, x0)λn
m−n−1

p=0
λp
≤λnd(x1, x0)


p=0
λp ≤d(x1, x0) λn
1 −λ
where we used the fact that +∞
p=0 λp = (1 −λ)−1 if 0 ≤λ < 1. In conclusion:
d(xm, xn) ≤d(x1, x0) λn
1 −λ .
(2.45)
For us |λ| < 1, so d(x1, x0)λn/(1 −λ) →0 as n →+∞. Hence d(xm, xn) can
be rendered as small as we like by picking the minimum between m and n to be
arbitrarily large. Therefore the sequence {xn}n∈N is Cauchy. But M is complete, so

limn→+∞xn = x ∈M for a certain x. Moreover, G is a contraction, so continuous,
and
G(x) = G

lim
n→+∞xn

n→+∞G(xn) =

as claimed.
Let us see to uniqueness. For that, assume x and x′ satisfy G(x) = x and G(x′) =
x′. Then
d(x, x′) = d(G(x), G(x′)) ≤λd(x, x′) .
If d(x, x′) ̸= 0, dividing by d(x, x′) would give 1 ≤λ, absurd by assumption. Hence
d(x, x′) = 0, so x = x′, because d is positive deﬁnite.
Now let us prove the theorem in case B := Gn is a contraction. By the previous
part B has a unique ﬁxed point z. Clearly, if G admits a ﬁxed point, this must be z.
There remains to show that z is ﬁxed under G as well. As B is a contraction, the
sequence B(z0), B2(z0), B3(z0), . . . converges to z, irrespective of z0 ∈M, as we
saw earlier in the proof. Therefore
G(z) = G(Bk(z)) = Bk(G(z)) = Bk(z0) →z
as k →+∞,
and G(z) = z.
⊓⊔
Moving to normed spaces, the theorem has as corollary the next fact, obtained using
the norm distance d(x, y) := ||x −y||.
Theorem 2.112 (Fixed-point theorem for normed spaces) Let G : X →X be a con-
traction on the closed set X ⊂B, with B a Banach space over R or C. Then there
exists a unique element z ∈X, called ﬁxed point:
G(z) = z .
(2.46)
If G : X →X is not a contraction, but the n-fold composite Gn = G ◦· · · ◦G is a
contraction for some n = 1, 2, . . ., then G admits a unique ﬁxed point.
Proof Deﬁne M := X and d(x, y) := ||x −y||, x, y ∈X. Thus X is a metric space.
Actually (X, d) is complete. In fact, a Cauchy sequence {xn}n∈N ⊂X for d is Cauchy
for || || too, as is easy to verify. As (B, || ||) is complete, the limit x ∈B of {xn}n∈N
exists. And since X is closed inside B, the point x belongs to X. Hence any Cauchy
sequence of (X, d) converges in X, making (X, d) complete. At this point we invoke
the previous theorem for the metric space (X, d) and conclude.
⊓⊔
The signiﬁcance of the ﬁxed-point theorem, by the way, depends on its role in proving
existence and uniqueness theorems for equations of all sorts, especially integral and
differential equations. Thegist is toshow that theequationtowhichweseekasolution
z can be written as a ﬁxed-point relation G(z) = z in a suitable Banach space (or
complete metric space). Example (1) below is a relatively simple case (G is linear),
while the ensuing (2) typically pertains nonlinear contractions.

Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
Example 2.113 Let us present two elementary instances of how the ﬁxed-point the-
ory is used. A more important situation will be treated in the following section.
(1)ThehomogeneousVolterraequationonC([a, b])intheunknown f ∈C([a, b])
reads:
f (x) =
	 x
a
K(x, y) f (y)dy ,
(2.47)
where K is a continuous function bounded by M ≥0. We equip the Banach space
C([a, b]) with the sup norm || ||∞. The equation may be written in the form f = Af ,
where A : C([a, b]) →C([a, b]) is the integral operator determined by the integral
kernel K:
(Af )(x) :=
	 x
a
K(x, y) f (y)dy ,
f ∈C([a, b]).
(2.48)
If a solution exists, then clearly it is the ﬁxed point of A. Not only this: the solution
is also ﬁxed under every operator An whichever power n = 1, 2, . . . we take. Let us
show that we can ﬁx n so to make An a contraction. By virtue of Theorem 2.112 this
would guarantee that the homogeneous Volterra equation admits one, and one only,
solution: this is necessarily the trivial one, because A is linear. A direct computation
shows:
|(Af )(x)| =

The ﬁrst iteration gives
|(A2 f )(x)| ≤M2 (x −a)2

|| f ||∞,
and, after n −1 steps,
|(An f )(x)| ≤Mn (x −a)n
n!
|| f ||∞.
Hence:
||An f ||∞≤Mn (b −a)n
n!
|| f ||∞,
and so:
||An|| ≤Mn (b −a)n
n!
.
For n large enough then, whatever a, b, M, are, we have:
Mn (b −a)n
n!
< 1 .

2.6 The Fixed-Point Theorem and Applications
95
Therefore for some positive λ < 1:
||An f −An f ′||∞≤λ|| f −f ′||∞,
and, by the ﬁxed-point theorem, the homogeneous Volterra equation on C([a, b])
only admits the trivial solution.
Consequently the operator A of (2.48) cannot admit eigenvalues different from
zero.
In fact the characteristic equation for A,
Aψ = λψ
for some λ ∈C and some ψ ̸= 0,
(2.49)
is equivalent to:
1
λ Aψ = ψ
λ ∈C \ {0}, ψ ̸= 0
ifλ ̸= 0.Andλ−1 A isaVolterraoperatorassociatedtotheintegralkernelλ−1K(x, y).
Therefore the theorem may be used on A to give ψ = 0. Since the eigenvalue was
not allowed to vanish, (2.49) has no solution.
ThisresultwillbegeneralisedinChap.4toHilbertspaces.Itwillbearanimportant
consequence in the study of Volterra’s inhomogeneous equation, once we have proved
Fredholm’s theorem on integral equations.
(2) Consider the existence and uniqueness problem for a continuous map y = f (x)
when we only know an implicit relation of the type F(x, y(x)) = 0, for some given
and sufﬁciently regular function F. We discuss a simpliﬁed version of a result that is
conventionally known as either Dini’s theorem, implicit function theorem or inverse
function theorem [CoFr98II, Ser94II]. The point is to see the Banach–Caccioppoli
theorem in action. Suppose we are given a function F : [a, b] × R →R, a < b, that
is continuous and admits partial y-derivative such that 0 < m ≤| ∂F
∂y | ≤M < +∞,
(x, y) ∈[a, b] × R.
We want to show that there exists a unique continuous map f : [a, b] →R such
that:
F(x, f (x)) = 0 for any x ∈[a, b].
The idea is to deﬁne a contraction G : C([a, b]) →C([a, b]) having f as ﬁxed point.
To this end set:
(G(ψ))(x) := ψ(x) −1
M F(x, ψ(x)) for any ψ ∈C([a, b]), x ∈[a, b].
This is well deﬁned on C([a, b]), and if it contracts then its unique ﬁxed point f
satisﬁes:
f (x) = f (x) −1
M F(x, f (x)) for any x ∈[a, b].

96
2
Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
In other words:
F(x, f (x)) = 0 for any x ∈[a, b],
so G is what we are after. But G is easily a contraction by the mean value theorem:
(G(ψ))(x) −(G(ψ′))(x) = ψ(x) −ψ′(x) −1
M

F(x, ψ(x)) −F(x, ψ′(x))

,
so for some number z between ψ(x) and ψ′(x):
(G(ψ))(x) −(G(ψ′))(x) = ψ(x) −ψ′(x) −1
M (ψ(x) −ψ′(x))∂F
∂y |(x,z) ,
and therefore:
|(G(ψ))(x) −(G(ψ′))(x)| ≤|ψ(x) −ψ′(x)|
1 −1
M
∂F
∂y |(x,z)
 .
Because the derivative’s range lies inside the positive interval [m, M], we have:
||G(ψ) −G(ψ′)||∞≤||ψ −ψ′||∞(1 −m
M ) .
Now, by assumption (1 −m
M ) < 1, so G is indeed a contraction.

2.6.2
Application of the Fixed-Point Theorem: Local
Existence and Uniqueness for Systems of Differential
Equations
The most important application, by far, of the ﬁxed-point theorem is certainly the
theorem of local existence and uniqueness for ﬁrst-order systems of differential
equations in normal form (where the highest derivative, here the ﬁrst, is isolated on
one side of the equation, as in (2.51) below). This result extends easily to global
solutions and higher-order systems [CoFr98I, CoFr98II].
For this we need a preliminary notion. From now on K will be the complete ﬁeld
R, or possibly C, and || ||Kp the standard norm on Kp.
Deﬁnition 2.114 Let r ≥0 and n, m > 0 be given natural numbers, Ω ⊂Kr × Kn
a non-empty open set. A function F : Ω →Km is locally Lipschitz (in the variable
x ∈Kn for r > 0), if for any p ∈Ω there exists a constant L p ≥0 such that:
||F(z, x) −F(z, x′)||Km ≤L p||x −x′||Kn ,
for any pair (z, x), (z, x′) ∈Op,
(2.50)
Op ∋p being an open set.

2.6 The Fixed-Point Theorem and Applications
97
Any C1 map F : Ω →Km is locally Lipschitz in the variable x, as we shall shortly
see, but ﬁrst the theorem.
Theorem 2.115 (Local existence and uniqueness for systems of ODEs of order one)
Let f : Ω →Kn be a continuous and locally Lipschitz map in x ∈Kn on the open
set Ω ⊂R × Kn. Given the ﬁrst-order initial value problem (in normal form):
 dx
dt
= f (t, x(t)) ,
x(t0) = x0
(2.51)
with (t0, x0) ∈Ω, there exists an open interval I ∋t0 on which (2.51) has a unique
solution, necessarily belonging in C1(I).
Proof Notice, to being with, that any solution x = x(t) to (2.51) is of class C1.
Namely, it is continuous as the derivative exists, and directly from dx
dt = f (t, x(t))
we infer dx
dt must be continuous, because the equation’s right-hand side is a composite
of continuous maps in t.
Now, suppose x : I →Kn is differentiable and that (2.51) holds. By the funda-
mental theorem of calculus, by integrating (2.51) (the derivative of x(t) is continuous)
x : I →Kn must satisfy
x(t) = x0 +
	 t
t0
f (τ, x(τ)) dτ ,
for anyt ∈I.
(2.52)
Conversely, if x : I →Kn is continuous and satisﬁes (2.52), again the fundamental
theorem of calculus ( f is continuous) tells x = x(t) is differentiable and implies
(2.51). Therefore the continuous maps x = x(t) deﬁned on an open interval I ∋t0
that solve the integral equation (2.52) are precisely the solutions to (2.51) deﬁned
over I. So instead of solving (2.51) we can solve the equivalent integral problem
(2.52).
To prove existence, ﬁx once and for all a relatively compact open set Q ∋(t0, x0)
with Q ⊂Ω. Take Q small enough to have f locally Lipschitz in x. The standard
norm on Kn will be written || ||, and we shall use:
(i) 0 ≤M := max{|| f (t, x)|| | (t, x) ∈Q};
(ii) the constant L ≥0 such that || f (t, x) −f (t, x′)|| ≤L||x −x′||, (t, x),
(t, x′) ∈Q;
(iii) Bε(x0) := {x ∈Kn | ||x −x0|| ≤ε} for ε > 0.
Consider the closed interval Jδ = [t0 −δ, t0 + δ], δ > 0 and the Banach space
(C(Jδ; Kn), || ||∞) of continuous maps X : Jδ →Kn (Proposition 2.18). On this
space deﬁne the map G that assigns to any function X a function G(X) by
G(X)(t) := x0 +
	 t
t0
f (τ, X(τ)) dτ ,
for any t ∈Jδ .

98
2
Normed and Banach Spaces, Examples and Applications
Note G(X) ∈C(Jδ; Kn) for X ∈C(Jδ; Kn) by the continuity of the integral in the
upper limit, when the integrand is continuous. We claim G is a contraction map on
a closed subset of C(Jδ; Kn): 2
M(δ)

:= {X ∈C(Jδ; Kn) | ||X(t) −x0|| ≤ε , ∀t ∈Jδ}
if 0 < δ < min{ε/M, 1/L}, and δ, ε > 0 are chosen small enough in order to have
Jδ × Bε(x0) ⊂Q. (Henceforth ε > 0 and δ > 0 will be assumed to satisfy Jδ ×
Bε(x0) ⊂Q.) With X ∈M(δ)
ε
we have:
||G(X)(t) −x0|| ≤

Therefore G(M(δ)

for 0 < δ < ε/M. If X, X′ ∈M(δ)
ε
then for all t ∈Jδ:
G(X)(t) −G(X′)(t) =

If, additionally, δ < 1/L, it follows that G : M(δ)
ε
→M(δ)
ε
is a contraction on the
closed set M(δ)
ε . By Theorem 2.112 G has a ﬁxed point, which is a continuous map
x = x(t) ∈Kn, t ∈Jδ, that solves (2.52) by deﬁnition of G. Restricting x to the open
interval I := (t0 −δ, t0 + δ) gives a solution to the initial value problem (2.51).
2M(δ)
ε
= {X ∈C(Jδ; Kn) | ||X −X0||∞≤ε}, where X0 is here the constant map equal to x0 on
Jδ. Thus M(δ)
ε
is the closure of the open ball of radius ε centred at X0 inside C(Jδ; Kn).

2.6 The Fixed-Point Theorem and Applications
99
As for uniqueness, take another solution x′ = x′(t) to (2.52) on I := (t0 −δ, t0 +
δ), a priori distinct from x = x(t). For any closed interval Jδ′ := [t0 −δ′, t0 + δ′],
0 < δ′ < δ, G : M(Jδ′)
ε
→M(Jδ′)
ε
is by construction still a contracting map, and x′ =
x′(t) a ﬁxed point of it. Therefore x′ coincides with x = x(t) restricted to Jδ′, by
uniqueness. (In particular, the restriction of x′ to Jδ′ belongs to the complete metric
space M(Jδ′)
ε
because we saw ||G(x′) −x0||∞≤δ′M < ε, since G(x′) = x′.) But
since δ′ is arbitrary in (0, δ), the two solutions coincide on I = (t0 −δ, t0 + δ).
⊓⊔
Just for the sake of completeness we remark that the previous theorem holds when
f is C1, because of the following elementary fact.
We adopt the usual notation
x = (x1, . . . , xn) , z = (z1, . . . , zl) and
F(z, x) = (F1(z, x), . . . , Fm(z, x))
foranarbitrarymap F : Ω →Rm withΩ = A × B, A ⊂Rl and B ⊂Rn non-empty
open sets.
Proposition 2.116 Consider Ω = A × B, A ⊂Rl and B ⊂Rn non-empty open
sets. The map F : Ω →Rm is locally Lipschitz in x if, for every z ∈A, the functions
B ∋x →Fk(z, x) admit ﬁrst derivative, and if the partial derivatives, as (z, x)
varies, are continuous on Ω.
Proof Take q = (z0, x0) ∈Ω and let B′ ⊂Rl, B ⊂Rn be open balls centred at z0,
x0, with B′ × B ⊂Ω. Then x(t) = p + t(r −p) ∈B, for t ∈[0, 1] and p,r ∈B.
Fix z ∈B′. The mean value theorem applied to [0, 1] ∋t →Fk(z, x(t)) results in

Remark 2.117 This particular proof of the theorem requires the local Lipschitz con-
dition for f in (2.51) in order to use the ﬁxed-point theorem. As a matter of fact, this is
not necessary to grant existence. A more general existence result, due to Peano, can be
proved (using the Arzelà–Ascoli Theorem 2.22) if one only assumes the continuity of
f [KoFo99]. In general, though, the absence of the Lipschitz condition undermines
the solution’s uniqueness, as the following classical counterexample makes clear:
consider
dx
dt = f (x(t)) ,
x(0) = 0
where f : R →R, deﬁned as f (x) = 0 on x ≤0 and f (x) = √x for x > 0, is
continuous but not locally Lipschitz at x = 0. The Cauchy problem admits at least
two solutions (both maximal):
(1) x1(t) = 0, for any t ∈R
(2) x2(t) = 0 for t ≤0 and x2(t) = t2/4 on t > 0.

n →+∞, for any x ∈X. This function will be measurable because it arises as limit
of measurable maps. We are left to prove that f is bounded and fn →f uniformly.
Start from the latter. Since
| f (x) −fm(x)| =
lim
n→+∞| fn(x) −fm(x)| ≤
lim
n→+∞|| fn −fm||∞,
and using the fact that the initial sequence is Cauchy for || ||∞, we have that for any
ε > 0 there is Nε such that:
lim
n→+∞|| fn −fm||∞< ε
form > Nε.
Hence:
| f (x) −fm(x)| < ε
for m > Nε and any x ∈X.
In other words || f −fm||∞→0 as m →+∞, as required. Now the boundedness
is obvious:

2.5 Show that the Banach spaces (L(X), || ||∞) and (Mb(X), || ||∞) (cf. Examples
2.29) are Banach algebras with unit.
Sketch. The unit is clearly the constant map 1. The property || f · g||∞≤
|| f ||∞||g||∞follows from the deﬁnition of || ||∞, and the remaining conditions
are easy.
2.6 Prove that the space C0(X) of continuous, complex functions on X that vanish
at inﬁnity (cf. Examples 2.29) is a Banach algebra for || ||∞. Explain in which
circumstances the algebra has a unit.
Solution. We take a Cauchy sequence { fn}n∈N ⊂C0(X) and prove it converges
uniformlyto f ∈C0(X).Byhypothesisthenumericalsequence{ fn(x)}n∈N isCauchy
for any x ∈X. Therefore there exists a function f : X →C such that fn(x) →f (x)
forany x ∈X,asn →+∞.Theproofthat|| f −fn||∞→0,n →+∞,goesexactly
as in Exercise 2.4. Since continuity is preserved by uniform limits, there remains to
show f ∈C0(X). Given ε > 0, pick n such that || f −fn|| < ε/2, and choose a
compact set Kε ⊂X so that | fn(x)| < ε/2 for x ∈X \ Kε. By construction
| f (x)| ≤| f (x) −fn(x)| + | fn(x)| < ε,
x ∈X \ Kε.
The Banach space thus found is a Banach algebra for the familiar operations, as one
proves without difﬁculty.
If the unit is present, it must be the constant map 1. If X is compact, the function
1 belongs to the space. But if X is not compact, then 1 cannot be in X, because the

2.9 Show that the space Cc(X) of complex functions with compact support on X
(cf. Examples 2.29) is not, in general, a Banach space for || ||∞, nor is it dense in
Cb(X) if X is not compact.
Outline of proof. For the ﬁrst statement we need to exhibit a counterexample
for X = R. Consider for instance the continuous maps fn : R →C, n = 1, 2, . . . ,:
fn(x) := sin x
x
for 0 < |x| < 2nπ, fn(0) = 1 and fn(x) = 0 at other points of R. The
sequence evidently converges pointwise to the continuous map deﬁned as sin x
x
on
R \ {0} and set to 1 at the origin. It is easy to convince ourselves that the convergence
is uniform. But the limit function does not have compact support. As for the second
part, note that any constant map c ̸= 0 belongs in Cc(X). But if X is not compact,
then || f −c||∞≥|c| > 0 for any function f ∈Cc(X) because of the values attained
outside the support of f .

Integrating the above, and noting that the right-hand-side integral is 1/p + 1/q = 1
we recover Hölder’s inequality in the form:

X | f (x)|pdμ(x)
1/p and
B :=

X |g(x)|pdμ(x)
1/p. The inequality is trivial in case p = 1 or if one of A, B
is inﬁnite. So we assume p > 1, A, B < +∞. Then I must be ﬁnite too, because
(a + b)p ≤2p(a p + bp) for any a, b ≥0 and p ≥1.3 Minkowski’s inequality is
trivial also when I = 0, so we consider only p > 1, A, B < +∞, 0 < I < +∞.
Note | f + g|p = | f | | f + g|p−1 + |g| | f + g|p−1. Using Hölder’s inequality on
each summand on the right we have:

2.15 Take two ﬁnite-dimensional normed spaces X, Y and consider T ∈L(X, Y) =

2.19 In a normed space X prove that if {xn}n∈N ⊂X tends to x ∈X weakly (cf.
Proposition 2.74), the set {xn}n∈N is bounded.
Hint. Use Corollary 2.64.

2.24 Using weak equi-boundedness, prove this variant of the Banach–Steinhaus
Theorem 2.62.
Proposition. Let X be a Banach space and Y a normed space over the same ﬁeld C,

sup
α∈A
| f (Tαx)| < +∞for any x ∈X, f ∈Y′ .
Then there exists a uniform bound K ≥0:
||Tα|| ≤K
for any α ∈A .
Solution. Referring to Corollary 2.59, for any given x ∈X deﬁne Fα,x :=
I(Tαx) ∈(Y′)′. Then
sup
α∈A
|Fα,x( f )| < +∞for any f ∈Y′ .
As Y′ is complete, we can use Theorem 2.62 to infer the existence, for any x ∈X,
of Kx ≥0 that bounds uniformly the family Fα,x : Y′ →C:
||Fα,x|| ≤Kx

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
There’s no such thing as a deep theorem, but only theorems we
haven’t understood very well.
Nicholas P. Goodman
WiththischapterweintroducetheﬁrstmathematicalnotionsrelativetoHilbertspaces
that we will use to build the mathematical foundations of Quantum Mechanics. A
good part is devoted to Hilbert bases (complete orthonormal systems), which we
treat in full generality without assuming the Hilbert space be separable. Before that,
we discuss a paramount result in the theory of Hilbert spaces: Riesz’s representation
theorem, according to which there is a natural anti-isomorphism between a Hilbert
space and its dual.
The third section studies adjoint operators (to bounded operators), introduced
by means of Riesz’s theorem, and their place at the heart of the theory of bounded
operators. In particular, we introduce ∗-algebras, C∗-algebras (and operator C∗-
algebras) and their representations. Here we deﬁne self-adjoint, unitary and normal
operators, and examine their basic properties.
Section four is entirely dedicated to orthogonal projectors and their main features.
We also introduce the useful notion of partial isometry.
The ﬁfth section is concerned with the important polar decomposition theorem
for bounded operators deﬁned on the whole Hilbert space. The positive square root
of a bounded operator is used as technical tool.
Section six introduces von Neumann algebras, with attention to the famous double
commutant theorem.
The elementary theory of the Fourier and Fourier–Plancherel transforms, object
of the last section, is introduced very rapidly and with, alas, no mention to Schwartz’s
distributions (for this see [Rud91, ReSi80, Vla02]).

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
3.1
Elementary Notions, Riesz’s Theorem and Reﬂexivity
The present section deals with the basics of Hilbert spaces, starting from the elemen-
tary deﬁnitions of Hermitian inner product and Hermitian inner product space.
3.1.1
Inner Product Spaces and Hilbert Spaces
Deﬁnition 3.1 If X is a complex vector space, a map S : X × X →C is called a
Hermitian inner product, and (X, S) an inner product space, when:
H0. S(u, u) ≥0 for any u ∈X;
H1. S(u, αv + βw) = αS(u, v) + βS(u, w) for any α, β ∈C and u, v, w ∈X;
H2. S(u, v) = S(v, u) for any u, v ∈X;
H3. S(u, u) = 0 ⇒u = 0, for any u ∈X.
If H0, H1, H2 hold and H3 does not, S is a Hermitian semi-inner product.
Two vectors u, v ∈X are orthogonal, written u ⊥v, if S(u, v) = 0. In this case
u and v are called orthogonal (or normal) to one another.
The orthogonal space to a non-empty subspace K ⊂X is:
K ⊥:= {u ∈X | u ⊥v for any v ∈K} .
Remarks 3.2 (1) H1 and H2 imply that S is antilinear in the ﬁrst argument:
S(αv + βw, u) = αS(v, u) + βS(w, u) for any α, β ∈C, u, v, w ∈X.
(2) It is immediate that K ⊥is a vector subspace in X by H1, so the name orthogonal
space is not accidental.
(3) In an inner product space (X, S), the deﬁnition of orthogonality implies a useful
property we will use often:
K ⊂K1
⇒
K ⊥
1 ⊂K ⊥
for K, K1 ⊂X.
(4) From now, lest we misunderstand, “(semi-)inner product” will always stand for
“Hermitian (semi-)inner product”.
■
Proposition 3.3 Let X be a C-vector space with semi-inner product S.
(a) The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality holds:
|S(x, y)|2 ≤S(x, x)S(y, y),
x, y ∈X ;
(3.1)
moreover

3.1 Elementary Notions, Riesz’s Theorem and Reﬂexivity
109
(i) there is equality in (3.1) if x, y are linearly dependent;
(ii) there is equality in (3.1) if and only if x, y are linearly dependent, provided S
is an inner product.
(b) As x ∈X varies,
p(x) :=

S(x, x)
(3.2)
deﬁnes the seminorm induced by S (a norm if S is an inner product).
(c) the seminorm p satisﬁes the parallelogram rule:
p(x + y)2 + p(x −y)2 = 2(p(x)2 + p(y)2),
x, y ∈X .
(3.3)
(d) the polarisation formula holds:
S(x, y) = 1
4

p(x + y)2 −p(x −y)2 −ip(x + iy)2 + ip(x −iy)2
,
x, y ∈X
(3.4)
Proof (a) If α ∈C, using the properties of the semi-inner product,
0 ≤S(x −αy, x −αy) = S(x, x) −αS(x, y) −αS(y, x) + |α|2S(y, y) .
(3.5)
Suppose S(y, y) ̸= 0. Then setting α := S(x, y)/S(y, y), (3.5) implies:
0 ≤S(x, x) −|S(x, y)|2/S(y, y) ,
as claimed. If S(y, y) = 0, from (3.5) we ﬁnd, for any α ∈C:
0 ≤S(x, x) −αS(x, y) −αS(y, x) .
(3.6)
By choosing α ∈R large enough in absolute value we see that inequality (3.6) is
not satisﬁed unless S(x, y) + S(y, x) = 0. Choosing now α = iλ with λ ∈R large
enough in absolute value, we ﬁnd that (3.5) can hold only if S(x, y) −S(y, x) = 0.
With the previous S(x, y) = −S(y, x) it gives S(x, y) = 0. Summing up, S(y, y) =
0 implies (3.1) because S(x, y) = 0. If x, y are linearly dependent then x = αy or
y = αx for some α ∈C. If so, the two sides of (3.1) are equal. Now assume S is an
inner product and |S(x, y)|2 = S(x, x)S(y, y), and let us prove there are α, β ∈C,
not both zero, so that αx + βy = 0. If at least one of x, y is null, the claim is true.
So suppose neither vanishes, so S(x, x) > 0 < S(y, y) by H3. Then redeﬁning
u = x/√S(x, x), v = y/√S(y, y), we have |S(u, v)| = 1 and so S(u, v) = eiη for
some η ∈R. By H3, α′u + β′v = 0 is equivalent to S(α′u + β′v, α′u + β′v) = 0,
i.e.
|α′|2 + |β′|2 + α′β′eiη + β′α′e−iη = 0 ,
as S(u, v) = eiη. Choose α′ = eiμ, β′ = eiν, so that −μ+ν+η = π. Then the above
identity holds, and setting α := eiμ√S(y, y), β := eiν√S(x, x) we have α, β ̸= 0
and αx + βy = 0.

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
(b) Verifying that p is a seminorm is easy knowing S is a (semi-)inner product,
except perhaps the triangle inequality N2 which we prove now. By the properties of
the inner product
p(x + y)2 = p(x)2 + 2ReS(x, y) + p(y)2 ,
with Re denoting the real part of a complex number. As ReS(x, y) ≤|S(x, y)|, by
(3.1), we also have ReS(x, y) ≤p(x)p(y). Substituting above gives:
p(x + y)2 ≤p(x)2 + 2p(x)p(x) + p(y)2 ,
i.e.
p(x, y)2 ≤(p(x) + p(y))2 ,
which in turn implies N2. Property N3 is immediate from H3, in case S is an inner
product.
Statements (c) and (d) are straightforward from the deﬁnition of p and the prop-
erties of inner product.
□
Remarks 3.4 (1) The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality immediately implies that an inner
product S : X×X →C is a continuous map on X×X in the product topology, when
X has the topology of the norm induced by the inner product, i.e. (3.2). In particular
the inner product is continuous in its arguments separately.
(2) If the ground ﬁeld is R instead of C, we have analogous Deﬁnition 3.1, by
declaring a real inner product S : X × X →R to fulﬁl H0, H1, H3 and replacing
H2 with the symmetry property:
H2’. S(u, v) = S(v, u) for any u, v ∈X.
A real semi-inner product is a real inner product without H3, so to speak.
(3) Proposition 3.3 is still true for real (semi-)inner products, with the proviso that
the new polarisation formula reads:
S(x, y) = 1
4

p(x + y)2 −p(x −y)2
(3.7)
over the ﬁeld R.
(4) The polarisation identity (3.4) and the corresponding Eq.(3.7) for real vector
spaces are valid even if S is not an inner product, provided it is re-written into a
suitable form. In the complex case linearity in the left entry and antilinearity in the
right entry are sufﬁcient. In the real case bilinearity and symmetry are enough. This
matter is sorted out in Exercises 3.1 and 3.2.
■
A known result – rarely proved explicitly – is the following, due to Fréchet, von
Neumann and Jordan. The proof is carried out in Exercises 3.3–3.5.
Theorem 3.5 Let X be a complex vector space and p : X →R a norm (or semi-
norm). Then p satisﬁes the parallelogram rule (3.3) if and only if there exists a unique
inner product (or semi-inner product) S inducing p by way of (3.2).

3.1 Elementary Notions, Riesz’s Theorem and Reﬂexivity
111
Proof If the norm (seminorm) is induced by a Hermitian inner product, the paral-
lelogram rule (3.3) is valid by Proposition 3.3(c). The proof that (3.3) implies the
existence of an inner product (semi-inner product) S inducing p via (3.2) can be
found in Exercises 3.3–3.5.
□
Let us pass to isomorphisms of inner product spaces.
Deﬁnition 3.6 Let (X, SX), (Y, SY) be inner product spaces. A linear map L : X →
Y is called an isometry if:
SY(L(x), L(y)) = SX(x, y) for any x, y ∈X.
If the isometry L : X →Y is onto we call it an isomorphism of inner product
spaces.
If one such L exists, the spaces X and Y are said to be isomorphic (under L).
Remark 3.7 Every isometry L : X →Y is clearly 1-1 by H3, but may not be
onto, even when X = Y, if the dimension of X is not ﬁnite. Every isometry is
moreover continuous in the norm topologies induced by inner products. If surjective
(an isomorphism), its inverse is an isometry (isomorphism).
■
Since an inner product space is also normed, we have two notions of isometry for
a linear transformation L : X →Y. The ﬁrst refers to the preservation of inner
products (as above), the second was given in Deﬁnition 2.10, and corresponds to the
requirement: ||Lx||Y = ||x||X for any x ∈X, with reference to the norms induced
by the inner products. The former type also satisﬁes the second deﬁnition. Using
the polarisation formula (3.4) it can actually be proved that the two notions are
equivalent.
Proposition 3.8 A linear operator L : X →Y between inner product spaces is an
isometry in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.6 if and only if:
||Lx||Y = ||x||X for any x ∈X,
where the norms are induced by the corresponding inner products.
Notation 3.9 Unless we say otherwise, from now on ( | ) will indicate an inner
product and || || the induced norm, as in Proposition 3.3.
■
Now to the truly central notion of the entire book, that of Hilbert space.

112

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
Deﬁnition 3.10 (Hilbert space) A complex vector space equipped with a Hermitian
inner product is called a Hilbert space if the norm induced by the inner product
makes it a Banach space.
An isomorphism of inner product spaces between Hilbert spaces is called:
(i) isomorphism of Hilbert spaces, or
(ii) unitary transformation, or
(iii) unitary operator.
It must be clear that under an isomorphism of inner product spaces U : H →H1, H1
is a Hilbert space if and only if H is. Then U is a unitary transformation.
There is a result about completions similar to the one seen for Banach spaces.
Theorem 3.11 (Completion of Hilbert spaces) Let X be a C-vector space with inner
product S.
(a) There exists a Hilbert space (H, ( | )), called completion of X, such that X is
identiﬁed with a dense subspace of H (for the norm induced by ( | )) under a 1-1
linear map J : X →H that extends S to ( | ):
J(X) = H
and
(J(x)|J(y)) = S(x, y)
for any x, y ∈X.
(b) If the triple (J1, H1, ( | )1), with J1 : X →H1 a linear isometry and (H1, ( | )1) a
Hilbert space, is such that J1 identiﬁes X with a dense subspace in H1 by extending
S to ( | )1, then there is a unique unitary transformation φ : H →H1 such that
J1 = φ ◦J.
Sketch of proof. (a) It is convenient to use the completion theorem for Banach
spaces and then construct the Banach completion of the normed space (X, N), where
N(x) := √S(x, x). Since S is continuous and X is dense in the completion under
the linear map J, S induces a semi-inner product ( | ) on the Banach completion H.
Actually, ( | ) is an inner product on H because, still by continuity, it induces the
same norm of the Banach space. Thus H is a Hilbert space and the map J sending X
to a dense subspace in H satisﬁes all the requirements. (b) The proof is essentially
the same as in the Banach case.
□
Examples 3.12 (1)Cn withinnerproduct(u|v) := n
i=1 uivi,whereu = (u1, . . . , un),
v = (v1, . . . , vn), is a Hilbert space.
(2) A crucial Hilbert space in physics was deﬁned in Example 2.29(6), namely
L2(X, μ). Recall that if X is a measure space with positive, σ-additive measure
μ on a σ-algebra Σ of subsets in X, then L2(X, μ) is a Banach space with norm
|| ||2:
||[ f ]||2
2 :=

X
f (x) f (x)dμ(x) ,
f being any representative in the equivalence class [ f ] ∈L2(X, μ) (as usual, we
shall write f instead of [ f ]).

3.1 Elementary Notions, Riesz’s Theorem and Reﬂexivity
113
If f, g ∈L2(X, μ) then f (x)g(x) ∈L1(X, μ), for (| f (x)|−|g(x)|)2 ≥0 implies
2| f (x)||g(x)| ≤| f (x)|2 + |g(x)|2 .
Hence:
( f |g) :=

X
f (x)g(x)dμ(x),
f, g ∈L2(X, μ)
(3.8)
is well deﬁned (which follows also from Hölder’s inequality, cf. Example 2.29(6)).
Elementary features of integrals guarantee the right-hand side of (3.8) is a Hermitian
inner product on L2(X, μ), which clearly induces || ||2. Therefore L2(X, μ) is a
Hilbert space with inner product (3.8).
(3) If one takes X = N and the counting measure μ (Example 2.29(7)), as a subcase
of the previous situation we obtain the Hilbert space ℓ2(N) of square-integrable
complex sequences, where
({xn}n∈N| {yn}n∈N) :=

3.1.2
Riesz’s Theorem and Its Consequences
Our next aim is to prove that Hilbert spaces are reﬂexive. In order to do so we need
to develop a few tools related to the notion of orthogonal spaces, and prove the
celebrated Riesz theorem.
Let us recall the deﬁnition of convex set (Deﬁnition 2.65).
Deﬁnition A set ∅̸= K in a vector space X is convex if:
λu + (1 −λ)v ∈K,
f or any λ ∈[0, 1] and u, v ∈K.
Clearly any subspace in X is convex, but not all convex subsets of X are subspaces
in X: open balls (with ﬁnite radius) in normed spaces are convex as sets but not
subspaces. For the next theorem we remind that < K > denotes the subspace in X
generated by K ⊂X, and K is the closure of K.
Theorem 3.13 Let (H, ( | )) be a Hilbert space and K ⊂H a non-empty subset.
Then
(a) K ⊥is a closed subspace of H.
(b) K ⊥=< K >⊥= < K >⊥= < K >
⊥.
(c) If K is closed and convex, for any x ∈H there is a unique PK(x) ∈K such that
||x −PK(x)|| = min{||x −y|| | y ∈K}, where || || is the norm induced by ( | ).
(d) If K is a closed subspace, any vector x ∈H decomposes in a unique fashion as
zx + yx with zx ∈K and yx ∈K ⊥, so that:

114
3
Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
H = K ⊕K ⊥.
(3.9)
Moreover, zx := PK(x).
(e) (K ⊥)⊥= < K >.
Remark 3.14 Actually, (a) and (b) hold also on more general spaces than Hilbert
spaces; it is enough to have an inner product space with the associated topology. ■
Proof of Theorem 3.13. (a) K ⊥is a subspace by the linearity of the inner product.
By its continuity it follows that if {xn} ⊂K ⊥converges to x ∈H then (x|y) = 0 for
any y ∈K, hence x ∈K ⊥. So K ⊥, containing all its limit points, is closed.
(b) The ﬁrst identity is trivial by deﬁnition of orthogonality and by linearity of the
inner product. The second relation follows immediately from (a). As for the third
one, since < K >⊂< K > we have < K >⊥⊃< K >
⊥. But < K >⊥⊂< K >
⊥
by continuity, so < K >⊥= < K >
⊥, ending the chain of equalities, because we
know < K >⊥= < K >⊥.
(c) Let 0 ≤d = inf y∈K ||x −y|| (this exists since the set of distances ||x −y|| with
y ∈K is bounded below and non-empty). Deﬁne a sequence {yn} ⊂K such that
||x −yn|| →d. We will show it is a Cauchy sequence. From the parallelogram rule
(3.3), where x, y are replaced by x −yn and x −ym, we have
||yn −ym||2 = 2||x −yn||2 + 2||x −ym||2 −||2x −yn −yn||2 .
As yn/2 + ym/2 ∈K under the convexity assumption, and since d is the inﬁmum
of the numbers ||x −y|| when y ∈K, it follows ||2x −yn −yn||2 = 4||x −
(yn + ym)/2||2 ≥4d2. Given ε > 0, and taking n, m large enough, we have:
||x −yn||2 ≤d2 + ε, ||x −ym||2 ≤d2 + ε, whence
||yn −ym||2 ≤4(d2 + ε) −4d2 = 4ε .
So the sequence is Cauchy. As H is complete, {yn} converges to some y ∈K because
K is closed. The norm is continuous, so d = ||x −y||. We claim y ∈K is the unique
point satisfying d = ||x −y||. For any other y′ ∈K with the same property:
||y −y′||2 = 2||x −y||2 + 2||x −y′||2 −||2x −y −y′||2 ≤2d2 + 2d2 −4d2 = 0 ,
by the parallelogram rule; we have used, above, the fact that ||2x −y −y′||2 =
4||x −(y + y′)/2||2 ≥4d2 (K is convex, d is the inﬁmum of ||x −z|| when z ∈K,
so y/2 + y′/2 ∈K). As ||y −y′|| = 0 we have y = y′. Thus PK(x) := y fulﬁls all
requirements.
(d) Take x ∈H, and x1 ∈K with smallest distance from x. Set x2 := x −x1, and
we will show x2 ∈K ⊥. Pick y ∈K, so the map R ∋t →f (t) := ||x −x1 + ty||2
has a minimum at t = 0. This is true if K is a subspace, so that −x1 + ty ∈K for
any t ∈R if x1, y ∈K. Hence its derivative vanishes at t = 0:

f ′(0) = lim
t→0
||x2 + ty||2 −||x2||2
t
= (x2|y) + (y|x2) = 2Re(x2|y) .
Therefore Re(x2|y) = 0. Replacing y by iy tells that the imaginary part of (x2|y)
is zero too, so (x2|y) = 0 and x2 ∈K ⊥. We have proved < K, K ⊥>= H. There
remains to show K ∩K ⊥= {0}. But this is obvious because if x ∈K ∩K ⊥, x must
be orthogonal to itself, so ||x||2 = (x|x) = 0 and x = 0.
(e) Any y ∈K is orthogonal to every element of K ⊥; by linearity and continuity of
the inner product this is true also when y ∈< K >. In other words,
< K > ⊂(K ⊥)⊥.
(3.10)
Using (d) and replacing K with the closed subspace < K > we obtain H = < K >⊕
< K >
⊥. By (b) that decomposition is equivalent to
H = < K > ⊕K ⊥.
(3.11)
If u ∈(K ⊥)⊥, by (3.11) there is a splitting into orthogonal ((u0|v) = 0) vectors
u = u0 + v, with u0 ∈< K > and v ∈K ⊥, and hence (u|v) = (v|v). But (u|v) = 0
(u ∈(K ⊥)⊥and v ∈K ⊥) so (v|v) = 0 and therefore (K ⊥)⊥∋u = u0 ∈< K >.
We conclude < K > ⊃(K ⊥)⊥, and hence the claim, by (3.10).
□
From (b) and (d) descends an immediate corollary.
Corollary 3.15 (to Theorem 3.13) If S is a subset in a Hilbert space H, < S > is
dense in H if and only if S⊥= {0}.
We are ready to state and prove a theorem due to F. Riesz, by far the most important
theorem in the theory of Hilbert spaces.
Theorem 3.16 (Riesz) Let (H, ( | )) be a Hilbert space. For any continuous linear
functional f : H →C there exists a unique element y f ∈H such that:
f (x) = (y f |x)
for any x ∈H .
The map H′ ∋f →y f ∈H is a bijection.
Proof Let us prove that for any f ∈H′ such a vector y f ∈H exists. The null space
of f , Ker f := {x ∈H | f (x) = 0}, is a closed subspace since f is continuous.
As H is a Hilbert space, H = Ker f ⊕(Ker f )⊥by Theorem 3.13. If Ker f = H
we deﬁne y f = 0 and the proof ends. If Ker f ̸= H we shall show (Ker f )⊥
has dimension 1. Let 0 ̸= y ∈(Ker f )⊥. Then f (y) ̸= 0 (y /∈Ker f !). For any
z ∈(Ker f )⊥, the vector z−f (z)
f (y) y belongs to (Ker f )⊥, being a linear combination of
elements in (Ker f )⊥. But z−f (z)
f (y) y ∈Ker f as well, by the linearity of f . Therefore
z −f (z)
f (y) y ∈Ker f ∩(Ker f )⊥, and z −f (z)
f (y) y = 0. So any other vector z ∈(Ker f )⊥
is a linear combination z =
f (z)
f (y) y of y, meaning y is a basis for (Ker f )⊥. If y is as
above, deﬁne:

116

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
y f := f (y)
(y|y) y
and we now show y f represents f in the sense required. If x ∈H, we decompose
x = n + x⊥along Ker f ⊕(Ker f )⊥, where
x⊥= f (x⊥)
f (y) y = f (x)
f (y) y,
because f (x⊥) = f (x) (by linearity, since f (n) = 0). So
(y f |x) =

f (y)
(y|y) y
					 n + f (x)
f (y) y

= 0 + f (y)
f (y)
(y|y)
(y|y) f (x) = f (x) .
The function H′ ∋f →y f ∈H is well deﬁned, i.e. f determines y f uniquely: if
(y|x) = (y′|x) for any x ∈K then (y −y′|x) = 0 for any x ∈K; and choosing
x = y −y′ gives ||y −y′||2 = (y −y′|y −y′) = 0, so y = y′. Injectivity is an easy
consequence of having f (x) = (y f |x). The map H′ ∋f →y f ∈H is further onto,
because, for any y ∈H, H ∋x →(y|x) is a point in H′ by linearity and continuity
of the inner product.
□
Corollary 3.17 (to Riesz’s theorem) Every Hilbert space is reﬂexive.
Proof First of all we can endow H′ with an inner product ( f |g)′ := (yg|y f ), where
f, g ∈H′ with f (x) = (y f |x) and g(x) = (yg|x), x ∈H. The norm induced by
( | )′ on H′ coincides with the norm of H′
|| f || := sup
||x||=1
| f (x)| ,
for which H′ is complete (Theorem 2.44). By Theorem 3.16 we may write, in fact,
|| f || = sup
||x||=1
|(y f |x)| ,
and the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality implies || f || ≤||y f ||. We also have |(y f |x)| =
||y f || for x = y f /||y f ||, hence || f || = ||y f ||, which is precisely the norm induced
by ( | )′.
Therefore (H′, (|)′) is a Hilbert space and (H′)′ its dual. Theorem 3.16 guarantees
that for any element in (H′)′, say F, there exists gF ∈H′ such that F( f ) = (gF| f )′
for any f ∈H′. But (gF| f )′ = (y f |ygF) = f (ygF). We have thus shown, for any
F ∈(H′)′, the existence (and uniqueness, by Corollary 2.59 to Hahn–Banach) of a
vector ygF ∈H such that:
F( f ) = f (ygF)
for any f ∈H′. This is the reﬂexivity of H.

Remark 3.18 FromthisproofweseethatthetopologicaldualH′,equippedwithinner

antilinear, 1-1, onto and it preserves the inner product by construction. In this sense
H and H′ are anti-isomorphic.

3.2
Hilbert Bases
Now we can introduce the mathematical arsenal attached to the notion of a Hilbert
basis. This is a well-known generalisation, to inﬁnite dimensions, of an orthonor-
mal basis. We shall work in the most general setting, where Hilbert spaces are not
necessarily separable and a basis can have any cardinality, even uncountable.
First we have to explain the meaning of an inﬁnite sum of non-negative numbers,
often over an uncountable set. An indexed set {αi}i∈I is a function I ∋i →αi. The
set I is the set of indices and αi is the ith element of the indexed set. Note that it
can happen that αi = α j for i ̸= j.
Deﬁnition 3.19 If A = {αi}i∈I is a non-empty set of non-negative reals indexed
by a set I of arbitrary cardinality, the sum of the indexed set A is the number, in
[0, +∞) ∪{+∞}, deﬁned by :

i∈I
αi := sup
⎧
⎨
⎩

j∈F
α j
						
F ⊂I ,
Fﬁnite
⎫
⎬
⎭.
(3.12)
Remark 3.20 From now on a set will be called countable when it can be mapped
bijectively to the natural numbers N. Thus, here, a ﬁnite set is not countable.
■
Proposition 3.21 In relation to Deﬁnition 3.19 we have:
(a) the sum of the set A coincides with the sum 
i∈I αi if I is ﬁnite, and with the sum
of the series +∞
n=0 αin if I is countable, irrespective of the ordering, i.e. independently
of the bijection N ∋n →in ∈I. (The series always converges, possibly to +∞,
because its terms are non-negative.)
(b) If the sum of the set A is ﬁnite, the subset of I for which αi ̸= 0 is ﬁnite or
countable. By restricting to this subset, the sum of A equals either the sum of ﬁnitely
many terms or the sum of the series, as in (a).
(c) If μ is the counting measure on I, deﬁned by the σ-algebra of the power set of I
(if J ⊂I then μ(J) ≤+∞is the cardinality of J by deﬁnition):

i∈I
αi =

A
αi dμ(i) .
(3.13)

118

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
Proof (a) The case when I is ﬁnite is obvious, so we look at I countable and suppose
to have chosen a particular ordering on I, so that we can write A = {αin}n∈N. We
will show that the sum +∞
n=0 αin of {αin}n∈N coincides with the sum of (3.12), which
by deﬁnition does not depend on the chosen ordering. Because of (3.12) we have:
N

n=0
αin ≤

i∈I
αi .
The limit as N →+∞exists and equals the supremum of the set of partial sums,
since the latter are non-decreasing. Therefore:
+∞

n=0
αin ≤

i∈I
αi .
(3.14)
On the other hand, if F ⊂I is ﬁnite, we may ﬁx NF large enough so that {αi}i∈F ⊂
{αi0, αi1, αi2, . . . , αiNF }. Thus

i∈F
αi ≤
NF

n=0
αin ,
Taking now the supremum over ﬁnite sets F ⊂I, and remembering that the supre-
mum of the partial sums is the sum of the series, gives

i∈I
αi ≤
+∞

n=0
αin .
(3.15)
Then (3.14) and (3.15) produce the claim.
(b) Suppose S < +∞, S ≥0, is the sum of the set A. If S = 0 all elements of
A are zero and the proof ends, so assume S > 0. Any αi is contained in [0, S],
for otherwise the sum would be larger than S, and in particular αi ̸= 0 implies
αi ∈(0, S]. Deﬁne Sn := S/n, n = 1, 2, . . .. If Nk denotes the number of indices
i ∈I for which αi belongs in (Sk+1, Sk], then surely S ≥Sk+1Nk, hence Nk is ﬁnite
for any k. But ∪+∞
k=1(Sk+1, Sk] = (0, S], so all αi ̸= 0 are accounted for. There can be
at most countably many of these values, since: (i) there are countably many intervals
(Sk+1, Sk] and (ii) each interval contains a ﬁnite number of αi ̸= 0.
(c) Since any function is measurable with respect to the given measure (the σ-algebra
is the power set), identity (3.13) is an immediate consequence of the deﬁnition of
integral of a positive function (cf. Sect.1.4.3).
□
Now we can deﬁne, step by step, complete orthonormal systems, also known as
Hilbert bases.
Deﬁnition 3.22 (Hilbert basis) Let (X, ( | )) be an inner product space and ∅̸=
N ⊂X a subset.

(a) N is an orthogonal system (of vectors) if (i) N ̸∋0 and (ii) x ⊥y for any
x, y ∈N, x ̸= y.
(b) N is an orthonormal system if its elements are mutually orthogonal unit vectors,
(x|x) = 1 for any x ∈N.
If (H, ( | )) is a Hilbert space, N ⊂H is a complete orthonormal system, or a
Hilbert basis, if it is orthonormal and:
N ⊥= {0} .
(3.16)
When no confusion arises, a Hilbert basis will be simply referred to as a basis.
Remark 3.23 Any orthogonal system N is made of linearly independent vectors: if
F ⊂N is ﬁnite and 0 = 

As ||x|| > 0 and |αx|2 ≥0, necessarily |αx| = 0, so αx = 0, for any x ∈F.

Theorem 3.24 (Bessel’s inequality) For any orthonormal system N ⊂X in an
inner product space (X, ( | )),

z∈N
|(x|z)|2 ≤||x||2 for any x ∈X .
(3.17)
In particular, only a countable number of products (x|z) are non-zero, at most.
Proof By Deﬁnition 3.19 and Proposition 3.21(b) the claim holds if inequality (3.17)
is true for all ﬁnite F ⊂N. So let F = {z1, . . . , zn}, x ∈X and take α1, . . . , αn ∈C.
Expanding ||x −n

Lemma 3.25 Let {xn}n∈N be a countable orthogonal system indexed by N in the
Hilbert space (H, ( | )), and let || || be the norm induced by ( | ). If

which in turn implies that the partial sums {An} are a Cauchy sequence. Since H is
complete, the sequence has a limit point x ∈H, and so does the series. But H is
normed, and the Hausdorff property tells that limits, x included, are unique.
(b) Fix a bijective map f : N →N. Set, as above, An := n
k=0 xk and σn :=

k=0 x f (k). The positive-term series +∞
k=0 ||x f (k)||2 converges because its partial
sums are smaller than the converging series +∞
k=0 ||xk||2. From part (a) the limit in
H of σn exists, and the rearranged series will converge in H, too. We claim this limit
is precisely x.
Deﬁne rn := max{ f (0), f (1), . . . , f (n)}, so
||Arn −σn||2 ≤

k∈Jn
||xk||2
where Jn arises from
{0, 1, 2, . . . , max{ f (0), f (1), . . . , f (n)}}
by erasing f (0), f (1), . . . , f (n). By bijectivity the remaining elements correspond
to certain points of the inﬁnite set

Therefore

As +∞

On the other hand rn ≥n ( f is injective, and if we had
max{ f (0), f (1), . . . , f (n)} < n ,
the various f (n) should be n + 1 non-negative integers smaller than n, a contradic-
tion). Therefore limn→+∞rn = +∞, so:

We can now state, and prove, the fundamental theorem about Hilbert bases, accord-
ing to which Hilbert bases generalise orthonormal bases in inner product spaces of
ﬁnite dimension. The novelty is that, at present, also inﬁnite linear combinations are

122

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
allowed, using the topology of H: any element of a Hilbert space can be written in a
unique fashion as an inﬁnite linear combination of basis elements.
Irrespective of the existence of bases, by Zorn’s lemma (or equivalently, the axiom
of choice) there are also ‘algebraic’ bases that require no topology. The difference
between a Hilbert basis and an algebraic basis is that the latter concerns ﬁnite combi-
nations only: despite the basis has inﬁnite cardinality, any vector in the (Hilbert) space
can be decomposed, uniquely, as a ﬁnite linear combination of the basis’ elements.
Theorem 3.26 Let (H, ( | )) be a Hilbert space and N ⊂H an orthonormal system.
The following facts are equivalent:
(a) N is a Hilbert basis (an orthonormal system with N ⊥= {0}).
(b) Given x ∈H, (at most) countably many products (z|x) are non-zero for all z ∈N,
and:
x =

z∈N
(z|x)z ,
(3.22)
where the series converges in the sense that partial sums converge in the inner product
topology.
(c) Given x, y ∈H, (at most) countably many products (z|x), (y|z) are non-zero for
all z ∈N, and
(x|y) =

z∈N
(x|z)(z|y) .
(3.23)
(d) If x ∈H:
||x||2 =

z∈N
|(z|x)|2 .
(3.24)
in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.19.
(e) < N > = H, i.e. the span of N is dense in H.
Under any of the above properties, in (3.22) and (3.23) the indexing order of non-null
coefﬁcients of (x|z), (z|x) = (x|z) and (z|y) is irrelevant.
Proof (a) ⇒(b). By Theorem 3.24 only countably many coefﬁcients (z|x) are non-
null, at most. Indicate by (zn|x), n ∈N, these numbers and ﬁx SN := N
n=0(zn|x)zn.
The system {(zn|x)zn}n∈N is by construction orthogonal, and because ||zn|| = 1
Bessel’s inequality implies +∞
n=0 ||(zn|x)zn||2 < +∞. By Lemma 3.25(a) the series
(3.22) converges to a unique x′ ∈H, x′ = +∞
n=0(zn|x)zn. Moreover, the series can
be rearranged, with the same limit x′ by Lemma 3.25(b). We claim x′ = x. The
linearity and continuity of the inner product force, for z′ ∈N:
(x −x′|z′) = (x|z′) −

z∈N
(x|z)(z|z′) = (x|z′) −(x|z′) = 0
where we have used the fact that the set of coefﬁcients z is an orthonormal system.
Since z′ ∈N is arbitrary, x−x′ ∈N ⊥and so x−x′ = 0, as N ⊥= {0} by assumption.

3.2 Hilbert Bases
123
This proves that (3.22) holds independently from the way we index the coefﬁcients
(z|x) ̸= 0.
(b) ⇒(c). If (b) holds, (c) is an obvious consequence, due to continuity and linearity
of the inner product, plus the fact N is orthonormal.
(c) ⇒(d). When y = x, (d) is a special case of (c).
(d) ⇒(a). If (d) is true and x ∈H is such that (x|z) = 0 for any z ∈N, then ||x|| = 0,
i.e. x = 0. In other words N ⊥= {0}, that is to say (a) holds.
So, we have proved (a), (b), (c) and (d) are equivalent. To ﬁnish notice that (b) implies
immediately (e), while (e) implies (a): if x ∈N ⊥, the inner product’s linearity gives
x ∈< N >⊥⊂< N >⊥. But Theorem 3.13(b) says < N >⊥= < N >
⊥. Since
< N > = H by hypothesis, x ∈H⊥= {0}. But this is (a), given that N ⊥= {0}.
The fact that the complex series in (3.23) can be rearranged to have the same sum
relies on the following argument. Consider the set
A := {z | (x|z) ̸= 0 or (y|z) ̸= 0} ,
which is countable. The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality in ℓ2(A) produces:

z∈A
|(x|z)||(z|y)| ≤

z∈A
|(x|z)|2

1/2 
z∈A
|(y|z)|2

1/2
< +∞
by (d). Hence the series 
z∈N(x|z)(z|y) = 
z∈A(x|z)(z|y) can be rearranged as
one likes, because it converges absolutely.
□
Zorn’s lemma now guarantees each Hilbert space admits a complete orthonormal
system.
Theorem 3.27 Every Hilbert space H ̸= {0} admits a Hilbert basis.
Proof Let H ̸= {0} be a Hilbert space and consider the collection A of orthonormal
systems in H. Deﬁne on A the partial order relation given by set-theoretical inclusion.
By construction any ordered subset E ⊂A is bounded above by the union of all
elements of E . Zorn’s lemma tells us that A has maximal element N. Therefore
there are in H no vectors that are normal to every element in N, non-zero and not
belonging to N itself. This means N is a complete orthonormal system.
□
Before moving on to separable Hilbert spaces, let us give another important result
from the general theory.
Theorem 3.28 Let H be a Hilbert space with Hilbert basis N. Then
(a) H is isomorphic, as Hilbert space, to L2(N, μ), where μ is the positive counting
measure of N (see Examples 2.29(6, 7) and 3.12(2)); the unitary transformation that
identiﬁes the two spaces is
H ∋x →{(z|x)}z∈N ∈L2(N, μ) ;
(3.25)

124
3
Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
(b) all Hilbert bases of H have the same cardinality (that of N), called the dimension
of the Hilbert space. (If H = {0} the dimension of H is assumed to be 0.)
(c) If H1 is a Hilbert space with the same dimension as H, the two spaces are
isomorphic as Hilbert spaces.
Proof (a) The map U : H ∋x →{(z|x)}z∈N ∈L2(N, μ) is well deﬁned because
if x ∈H and N is a basis, then property (d) of Theorem 3.26 holds, according to
which {(z|x)}z∈N ∈L2(N, μ). This function is deﬁnitely 1-1: if x, x′ ∈H give equal
coefﬁcients (z|x) = (z|x′) for any z ∈N, then x = x′ by Theorem 3.26(b). The map
is onto as well: if {αz}z∈N ∈L2(N, μ), so 
z∈N |αz|2 < +∞, by Lemma 3.25 there
is x := 
z∈N αzz and (z|x) = αz by inner product continuity and orthonormality of
N. Now Theorem 3.26(c) implies U is isometric. Therefore U : H →L2(N, μ) is
a unitary operator, making H and L2(N, μ) isomorphic Hilbert spaces.
(b) If one Hilbert basis has ﬁnite cardinality c, it must be an algebraic basis for H.
Elementary geometric techniques allow to prove that if a basis of ﬁnite cardinality
c exists, then any other set of linearly independent vectors M has cardinality ≤c,
and the maximum is reached if and only if M spans the whole space. Since a basis,
being an orthogonal system, is made of linearly independent vectors, we conclude
that any basis of H has cardinality ≤c, hence = c because it spans H ﬁnitely. This
forbids the situation where one basis is ﬁnite and another inﬁnite. So let N and M be
bases di H of inﬁnite cardinality. If x ∈M, deﬁne Nx := {z ∈N | (x|z) ̸= 0}. As
1 = (z|z) = 
x∈M |(z|x)|2, we must have, for any z ∈N, an element x ∈M such
that z ∈Nx. Therefore N ⊂∪x∈M Nx and then the cardinality of N will be less than
or equal to that of ∪x∈M Nx. But the latter is the cardinality of M because any Nx is
at most countable by Theorem 3.26(b). So the cardinality of N does not exceed the
cardinality of M. Swapping the roles of N and M we obtain that the cardinality of
M is not larger than that of N, and the theorem of Schröder–Bernstein ensures the
two cardinalities are equal.
(c) Let N and N1 be bases of H and H1 respectively, and suppose they have the
same cardinality. Then there is a bijective map taking points in N to points in N1
that induces a natural isomorphism V of inner product spaces between the L2 space
on N and the L2 space on N1 with respect to the counting measure. Therefore V
is an isomorphism of Hilbert spaces. If U1 : H1 →L2(N1, μ) is the isomorphism
analogous to the aforementioned U : H →L2(N, μ), then UVU−1
1
: H1 →H is a
unitary transformation, by construction, making H and H1 isomorphic spaces.

So-called separable Hilbert spaces are particularly interesting in physics.
Deﬁnition 3.29 A Hilbert space is separable if it admits a countable dense subset.
There is a well-known characterisation of separability.

3.2 Hilbert Bases
125
Theorem 3.30 Let H ̸= {0} be a Hilbert space.
(a) H is separable if and only if either dim H < ∞or it has a countable Hilbert
basis.
(b) If H is separable, then every basis is either ﬁnite, with cardinality equal to dim H,
or countable.
(c) If H is separable then it is isomorphic either to ℓ2(N), or to the standard Cn,
where n = dim H.
Proof (a) If the Hilbert space has a ﬁnite or countable basis, Theorem 3.26(b) ensures
that a countable dense set exists, because rational numbers are dense in the reals.
This set consists clearly of ﬁnite linear combinations of basis elements with complex
coefﬁcients having rational real and imaginary parts. The proof is easy and left to
the reader. Conversely, suppose a Hilbert space is separable. By Theorem 3.27 we
know bases exist, and we want to show that any basis must be countable at most.
Suppose, by contradiction, that N is an uncountable basis for the separable Hilbert
space H. For any chosen z, z′ ∈N, z ̸= z′, any point x ∈H satisﬁes ||z −z′|| ≤
||x −z′|| + ||z −x||, by the triangle inequality induced by the inner product. At
the same time {z, z′} is an orthonormal system, so ||z −z′||2 = (z −z′|z −z′) =
||z||2 + ||z′||2 + 0 = 1 + 1 = 2. Hence ||x −z|| + ||x −z′|| ≥
√
2. This implies that
two open balls of radius ε <
√
2/2 centred at z and z′ are disjoint, irrespective of how
we pick z, z′ ∈N with z ̸= z′. Call {B(z)}z∈N a family of such balls parametrised by
their centres z ∈N. If D ⊂H is a countable dense set (the space is separable), then
for any z ∈N there exists x ∈D with x ∈B(z). The balls are pairwise disjoint, so
there will be one x for each ball, all different from one another. But the cardinality
of {B(z)}z∈N is not countable, hence neither D can be countable, a contradiction.
Although (b) and (c) are straightforward consequences of Theorem 3.28, for the
sake of the argument let us outline a proof.
(b) From the basic theory, if a (Hilbert or algebraic) basis is ﬁnite, the cardinality of
any other basis equals the dimension of the space. Moreover, any linearly independent
set (viewed as basis) cannot contain a number of vectors exceeding the dimension.
From this, if a Hilbert space is separable and one of its bases is ﬁnite, then all bases are
ﬁnite and have cardinality dim H. Under the same hypotheses, if a basis is countable
then any other is countable by (a).
(c) Fix a basis N. Using Theorem 3.26 one veriﬁes quickly that the map sending
H ∋x = 
u∈N αuu to the (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) family {αu}u∈N is an isomorphism
sending H to Cn (if dim H is ﬁnite) or to ℓ2(N) (if dim H is inﬁnite).
□
Here is another useful proposition about separable Hilbert spaces.
Proposition 3.31 Let (H, ( | )) be a Hilbert space with H ̸= {0}.
(a) If Y := {yn}n∈N is a set of linearly independent vectors and Y ⊥= {0}, or
equivalently < Y > = H, then H is separable and there exists a basis X := {xn}n∈N
in H such that, for any p ∈N, the span of y0, y1, . . . , yp coincides with the span of
x0, x1, . . . , x p.
(b) If H is separable and S ⊂H is a (non-closed) dense subspace of H, then S
contains a basis of H.

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
Proof (a) We shall only sketch the proof, since the argument essentially duplicates
the Gram–Schmidt orthonormalisation process known from basic geometry courses
[Ser94I].
Since y0 ̸= 0, we set x0 := y0/||y0||. Consider the non-null vector z1 := y1 −
(x0|y1)x0 (recall y0, y1 are linearly independent). Clearly x0, z1 are not zero, they are
orthogonal (so linearly independent) and span the same subspace as y0, y1. Setting
x1 := z1/||z1|| produces an orthonormal set {x0, x1} spanning the same space as
y0, y1. The procedure can be iterated inductively, by deﬁning:
zn := yn −
n−1

k=0
(xk|yn)xk ,
and considering the set of xn := zn/||zn||. By induction it is easy to see z0, . . . , zk are
non-null, orthogonal (hence linearly independent) and span the same space generated
by the linearly independent y0, . . . , yk. If u ⊥yn for any n ∈N, then u ⊥xn for
any n ∈N (it is enough to express xn as a linear combination of y0, . . . , yn), and
conversely (writing yn as combination of x0, . . . , xn). Therefore X⊥= Y ⊥= {0}
and X is a basis for H.
(b) We claim S must contain a subset S0 that is countable and dense in H. In fact, let
{yn}n∈N be countable and dense in H. For any yn there is a sequence {xnm}m∈N ⊂S
such that xnm →yn as m →+∞. It is straightforward that the countable subset
S0 := {xnm}(n,m)∈N×N of S is dense in H. Relabelling the elements of S0 over the
naturals so that x1 ̸= 0 we have S0 = {xq}q∈N. Now we can decompose S0 in
two subsets S1 and S2 as follows. The set S1 contains x1. Further, if x2 is linearly
independent from x1 we put x2 in S1, otherwise in S2. If x3 is linearly independent
from x1, x2 ∈S1 we put it in S1, otherwise in S2, and we continue like this until we
exhaust S0. Then by construction S1 contains a set of linearly independent generators
of S0. Thus < S1 > ⊃S0 = H. This process builds a complete orthonormal system
by ﬁnite linear combinations of Y := S1, as explained in (a), and so it gives a basis
made of elements of S since S ⊃S1 is a subspace.

Examples 3.32 (1) Consider the Hilbert space L2([−L/2, L/2], dx) (cf. Examples
3.12(2)) where dx is the usual Lebesgue measure on R and L > 0. Take measurable
functions (they are continuous)
fn(x) := ei 2πn
L x
√
L
(3.26)
for n ∈Z and x ∈[−L/2, L/2]. It is immediate to see that the fn belong to the
space and form an orthonormal system for the inner product:

of L2([−L/2, L/2], dx). Consider the Banach algebra C([−L/2, L/2]) (a vector
subspaceof L2([−L/2, L/2], dx))ofcontinuousmapswithsupremumnorm(Exam-
ples 2.29(4, 5)). The subspace S ⊂C([−L/2, L/2]) spanned by all fn, n ∈Z, is a
subalgebra of C([−L/2, L/2]). Now, S contains 1, it is closed under complex con-
jugation and it is not hard to see that it separates points in [−L/2, L/2] (the maps
fn already separate points), so the Stone–Weierstrass Theorem 2.30 guarantees S
is dense in C([−L/2, L/2]). On the other hand it is well known that continuous
maps on [−L/2, L/2] form a dense space in L2([−L/2, L/2], dx) in the latter’s
topology [Rud86, p. 85]. At last, the topology of C([−L/2, L/2]) is ﬁner than the
topology of L2([−L/2, L/2], dx), because ( f | f ) ≤L sup | f |2 = L(sup | f |)2 if
f ∈C([−L/2, L/2]). Therefore S is dense in L2([−L/2, L/2], dx). By Theorem
3.26(e), the vectors fn form a basis in L2([−L/2, L/2], dx), making the latter sep-
arable.
(2) Consider the Hilbert space L2([−1, 1], dx), dx being the Lebesgue measure. As
in the previous example the Banach algebra C([−1, 1]) is dense in L2([−1, 1], dx)
in the latter’s topology. In contrast to what we had previously, let
gn(x) := xn ,
(3.28)
for n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., x ∈[−1, 1]. It can be proved that these vectors are linearly
independent. Their span S in C([−1, 1]) is a subalgebra in C([−1, 1]) that contains
1, is closed under conjugation and separates points. Hence the Stone–Weierstrass
Theorem 2.30 implies it is dense in C([−1, 1]). By arguing as in the above exam-
ple S is also dense in L2([−1, 1], dx). The novelty is that now the functions gn
do not constitute an orthonormal system. However, using Proposition 3.31 we can
immediately build a complete orthonormal system on L2([−1, 1], dx). These basis
elements, up to a normalisation, are called Legendre polynomials:
Pn(x) =
1
2nn!
dn
dxn (x2 −1)n,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
By deﬁnition they obey orthogonality relations:

[−1,1]
Pn(x)Pm(x)dx =
2δnm
2n + 1 .
(3) In the previous examples we exhibited two separable L2 spaces. It can be proved
that L p(X, μ) (1 ≤p < +∞) is separable if and only if the measure μ is separable,
in the following sense. Take the subset of the σ-algebra Σ of μ made of all ﬁnite-
measure sets and mod out zero-measure sets. The quotient is a metric space (cf.
Deﬁnition 2.82) with distance:
d(A, B) := μ((A \ B) ∪(B \ A)) .

subset. Concerning separable measures we have the following result [Hal69].
Proposition 3.33 (On separable L p measures and spaces) A σ-additive positive
measure μ, and hence also L p(X, μ), is separable if the following conditions hold:
(i) μ is σ-ﬁnite (X is the union of at most countably many sets of ﬁnite measure) and
(ii) the σ-algebra of the measure space of μ is generated by a countable collection
of measurable sets at most.
As consequence we have
Proposition 3.34 (On separable Borel measures and L p spaces) Every σ-ﬁnite
Borel measure on a second-countable topological space produces a separable L p
space.
Remark 3.35 This is the case, in particular, of the L p space relative to the Lebesgue
measure on Rn restricted to Borel sets in Rn. Note, though, that this L p space is
the same we ﬁnd by using the entire Lebesgue σ-algebra, since the latter is the
completion of the Borel σ-algebra for the Lebesgue measure restricted to Borel
subsets, by Proposition 1.57 (see the remark following Proposition 1.66).
■
Positive and σ-additive Borel measures on locally compact Hausdorff spaces are
called Radon measures if they are regular and if compact sets have ﬁnite measure.
A Radon measure is σ-ﬁnite if the space on which it is deﬁned is σ-compact, i.e. the
union of (at most) countably many compact sets.
(4) Consider the space L2((a, b), dx), with −∞≤a < b ≤+∞and dx being
the usual Lebesgue measure on R. From the deﬁnitions of the Fourier and Fourier–
Plancherel transforms (Proposition 3.115) we infer an extremely useful result:
Let f : (a, b) →C be measurable and such that: (1) the set {x ∈(a, b) | f (x) =
0} has zero measure, and (2) there exist constants C, δ > 0 such that | f (x)| <
Ce−δ|x| for any x ∈(a, b).
Then the ﬁnite span of the maps x →xn f (x), n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., is dense in
L2((a, b), dx).
The importance of this fact lies in that it allows to construct with ease bases in
L2((a, b), dx) even when a or b are inﬁnite (a case in which we cannot apply the
Stone–Weierstrass Theorem 2.30). In fact, the Gram–Schmidt process applied to
fn(x) := xn f (x) yields a basis as explained in Proposition 3.31.
For instance, applying Gram–Schmidt to f (x) := e−x2/2 gives, normalisation
apart, the basis of L2(R, dx) of so-called (normalised) Hermite functions:
ψ0(x) = π−1/4e−x2/2
and, recursively,
ψn+1 = (2(n + 1))−1/2(x −d
dx )ψn
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .

3.2 Hilbert Bases
129
A computation, still relying on Gram–Schmidt essentially, shows that ψn can be
obtained alternatively as:
ψn(x) := (2nn!√π)−1/2Hn(x)e−x2/2
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
where Hn is a polynomial of degree n = 0, 1, 2, . . . called nth Hermite polynomial:
Hn(x) = (−1)nex2 dn
dxn e−x2
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
There are orthogonality relations:

R
e−x2 Hn(x)Hm(x)dx = δnm2nn!√π .
In QM this particular basis is important when one studies the physical system known
as the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator.
Applying the same procedure to f (x) := e−x/2 produces a basis of L2((0, +∞),
dx) given, up to normalisation, by Laguerre’s functions e−x Ln(x), n = 0, 1, . . ..
The polynomial Ln has degree n and goes under the name of nth Laguerre polyno-
mial. Laguerre polynomials are obtained from the formula:
Ln(x) = ex dn
dxn (xne−x) n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Again, we have normalising relations:

[0,+∞)
e−x Ln(x)Lm(x)dx = δnm(n!)2 .
In QM the basis of Laguerre functions is important when working with physical
systems having a spherical symmetry, like the hydrogen atom, for instance.
(5) Consider the separable Hilbert space L2(Rn, dx) (dx being the usual Lebesgue
measure on Rn). It is a renowned fact [Vla02] that real-valued smooth functions on
Rn with compact support (or complex-valued functions that decrease at inﬁnity faster
than any negative power of |x|) are dense in L p(Rn, dx), 1 ≤p < ∞. It falls out of
Proposition 3.31(b) that such subspaces contain bases of L2(Rn, dx).
(6) We will now construct the so-called Bargmann–Hilbert space, also known as
Bargmann–Fock space. This is a Hilbert space with a host of applications in QM and
Quantum Field Theory. Consider the following positive σ-additive measure deﬁned
on Borel sets E ⊂C, where χE is the characteristic function of E (χE(z) = 1 if
z ∈E, χE(z) = 0 if z /∈E):
μ(E) := 1

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
Here, as is customary in this formalism, we denoted by dzdz the Lebesgue measure
of R2 identiﬁed with C. A function f : C →C is entire if it is holomorphic
everywhere on C. Let H(C) be the space of entire functions. Take the subspace of
L2(C, μ) given by the intersection L2(C, μ) ∩H(C) – where the elements of H(C)
represent equivalence classes of maps (as for L p spaces). It is far from obvious that
L2(C, μ) ∩H(C) is a closed subspace of L2(C, μ), because it is not evident that a
sequence of entire functions converges, in L2(C, μ) sense, to an entire function (i.e.
the limit will be entire up to zero-measure sets). Bargmann, however, managed to
prove [Bar61] that
if f ∈H(C), then

C
| f (z)|2dμ(z) =
+∞

n=0
| fn|2 ≤+∞
(3.29)
where:
fn =
√
n!an
with
f (z) =
+∞

n=0
anzn .
(3.30)
The power series in (3.30) is just the Taylor expansion of f : it converges absolutely
for any z ∈C and uniformly on any compact set in C, and it exists by the mere
fact that f is entire. Notice that (3.29) establishes in particular that the positive-term
series on the right converges iff the integral of the left-hand-side function converges.
Hence f, g ∈L2(C, μ)∩H(C) if and only if { fn}n∈N, {gn}n=1,2... ∈ℓ2(N) (Example
2.29(7)), in which case the polarisation formula (3.4) and (3.29) give:

C
f (z)g(z)dμ(z) =
+∞

n=0
fngn .
(3.31)
In the notation of (3.30), let us consider the map:
J : L2(C, μ) ∩H(C) ∋f →{ fn}n∈N ∈ℓ2(N) .
This linear, isometric (hence 1-1) transformation is actually surjective as well. In fact,
since the series 
n∈N
|z|2n
(n!)2 converges for any z ∈C, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality
implies that the series:

n∈N
cn
√
n!
zn
√
n!
=: f (z)
converges absolutely for any z ∈C, provided {cn}n∈N ∈ℓ2(N) and if we deﬁne an
entire map f and J( f ) = {cn}n∈N. Since ℓ2(N) is complete we conclude that:
(a) the complex vector space B1 := L2(C, μ) ∩H(C) is a Hilbert space, i.e. a
closed subspace of L2(C, μ),
(b) B1 is isomorphic to ℓ2(N) under J (hence in particular separable),
(c) the system of entire maps {un}n∈N:

3.2 Hilbert Bases
131
un(z) =
zn
√
n!
for any z ∈C, n ∈N
(3.32)
is a basis for B1.
B1 is called the Bargmann–Hilbert or Bargmann–Fock space.
To conclude we observe that all constructions have a straightforward gener-
alisation to n copies of C, giving the n-dimensional Bargmann space Bn :=
L2(Cn, dμn) ∩H(Cn) where, for any Borel set E ∈Cn:
μn(E) := 1
πn

Cn χE(z)e−n

H(Cn) is the space of holomorphic maps in n variables on Cn and the integral is
computed in the product of the measures μ on each copy of C.

3.3
Hermitian Adjoints and Applications
We examine here one of the most important notions of the theory of operators on a
Hilbert space that derives from Riesz’s Theorem 3.16: (Hermitian) adjoint operators.
We have to stress that this concept can be extended to unbounded operators, but in this
section we consider only the bounded case. The general situation will be dealt with
extensively in a subsequent chapter. It is also worth recalling that a (related) notion
of adjoint operator (or conjugate operator) was given in Deﬁnition 2.45, without the
need of Hilbert structures. In the sequel we will not use the latter, exception made
for the occasional remark.
From a more abstract viewpoint, the Hermitian conjugation will give us the oppor-
tunity for introducing relevant mathematical notions in advanced formulations of
QM: we are talking about ∗-algebras, C∗-algebras and their representations.
3.3.1
Hermitian Conjugation, or Adjunction
Let (H1, ( | )1), (H2, ( | )2) be Hilbert spaces and T ∈B(H1, H2) an operator. For
a given u ∈H2, consider:
H1 ∋v →(u|T v)2 ∈C .
(3.33)
This map is certainly linear and bounded:
|(u|T v)2| ≤||u||2 ||T v||2 ≤||u||2 ||T|| ||v||1 .
Hence it belongs to H′
1. By Riesz’s Theorem 3.16 there exists wT,u ∈H1 such that

132
3
Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
(u|T v)2 = (wT,u|v)1 ,
for any v ∈H1 .
(3.34)
Moreover, the map H2 ∋u →wT,u ∈H1 is linear. In fact:
(wT,αu+βu′|v)1 = (αu +βu′|T v)2 = α(u|T v)2 +β(u′|T v)2 = (αwT,u +βwT,u′|v)1 ,
so, for any v ∈H1,
0 = (wT,αu+βu′ −αwT,u −βwT,u′|v)1 .
Choosing v := wT,αu+βu′ −αwT,u −βwT,u′, we have wT,αu+βu′ −αwT,u −βwT,u′ = 0
hence
wT,αu+βu′ = αwT,u + βwT,u′
for any α, β ∈C, u, u′ ∈H2. Therefore there exists a linear operator:
T ∗: H2 ∋u →wT,u ∈H1 .
By construction T ∗satisﬁes (u|T v)2 = (T ∗u|v)1 for any pair u ∈H2, v ∈H1, and
actually it is the unique linear operator with such property. If there were another
such B ∈L(H2, H1), then (T ∗u|v)1 = (Bu|v)1 for any v ∈H1. Consequently
((T ∗−B)u|v)1 = 0 for any v ∈H1. Choosing v := (T ∗−B)u would give ||(T ∗−
B)u||2
1 = 0, so T ∗u −Bu = 0. Since u ∈H2 is arbitrary, T ∗= B. Overall, we have
proved the following fact.
Proposition 3.36 Let (H1, ( | )1), (H2, ( | )2) be Hilbert spaces, and T ∈B(H1, H2).
There exists a unique linear operator T ∗: H2 →H1 such that:
(u|T v)2 = (T ∗u|v)1 ,
for any pair u ∈H2, v ∈H1.
(3.35)
We are ready to deﬁne adjoint Hermitian operators. From now on we will drop the
adjective “Hermitian”, given that this textbook will never use non-Hermitian adjoint
operators as we said at the beginning.
Deﬁnition 3.37 Let (H1, ( | )1), (H2, ( | )2) be Hilbert spaces and T ∈B(H1, H2).
The unique linear operator T ∗∈L(H2, H1) fulﬁlling (3.35) is called the (Hermitian)
adjoint, or Hermitian conjugate to the operator T .
Recall that given a linear operator T : X →Y between vector spaces, Ran(T ) :=
{T(x) | x ∈X} and Ker(T ) := {x ∈X | T (x) = 0} denote the subspaces of Y and
X called range (or image) and kernel (or null space) of T .
The operation of Hermitian conjugation enjoys the following elementary
properties.
Proposition 3.38 Let (H1, ( | )1), (H2, ( | )2) be Hilbert spaces and T ∈B(H1, H2).
Then
(a) T ∗∈B(H2, H1), and more precisely:

3.3 Hermitian Adjoints and Applications
133
||T ∗|| = ||T || ,
(3.36)
||T ∗T || = ||T ||2 = ||T T ∗|| .
(3.37)
(b) The Hermitian conjugation is involutive:
(T ∗)∗= T .
(c) If S ∈B(H1, H2) and α, β ∈C:
(αT + βS)∗= αT ∗+ βS∗,
(3.38)
and if S ∈B(H, H1), with H a Hilbert space:
(T S)∗= S∗T ∗.
(3.39)
(d) We have:
Ker(T ) = [Ran(T ∗)]⊥,
Ker(T ∗) = [Ran(T )]⊥.
(3.40)
(e) T is bijective if and only if T ∗is bijective, in which case (T ∗)−1 = (T −1)∗.
Proof From now on we will write || || to denote both || ||1 and || ||2, and similarly
for inner products. It will be clear from the context which is which.
(a) For any pair u ∈H2, x ∈H1 we have |(T ∗u|x)| = |(u|T x)| ≤||u||||T||||x||. By
choosing x := T ∗u we have in particular ||T ∗u||2 ≤||T || ||u|| ||T ∗u||, so ||T ∗u|| ≤
||T || ||u||. Hence T ∗is bounded and ||T ∗|| ≤||T ||. Therefore it makes sense to
deﬁne (T ∗)∗, so ||(T ∗)∗|| ≤||T ∗||. This inequality becomes ||T|| ≤||T ∗|| by (b)
(whose proof only uses the boundedness of T ∗). As ||T ∗|| ≤||T|| and ||T|| ≤||T ∗||,
equation (3.36) follows. Let us pass to (3.37). It sufﬁces to prove the ﬁrst identity,
since the second descends from the ﬁrst one and (3.36), by (b) (which does not depend
on (a)). By Theorem 2.44(b), case (i), whose conclusion holds for S ∈B(Y, X),
T ∈B(Z, Y) with X, Y, Z normed, we have ||T ∗T || ≤||T ∗|| ||T || = ||T||2. At the
same time:
||T||2 = ( sup
||x||≤1
||T x||)2 = sup
||x||≤1
||T x||2 = sup
||x||≤1
(T x|T x) .
By deﬁnition of adjoint and by Cauchy–Schwarz (on the last term) we obtain:
||T ||2 = sup
||x||≤1
(T x|T x) = sup
||x||≤1
|(T ∗T x|x)| ≤sup
||x||≤1
||T ∗T x|| = ||T ∗T || .
Therefore ||T ∗T || ≤||T ||2 and ||T ||2 ≤||T ∗T ||, so ||T ∗T || = ||T||2.
(b) This follows immediately from the uniqueness of the adjoint operator. By known
properties of the inner product and the deﬁnition of adjoint to T , in fact, we have:

134
3
Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
(v|T ∗u) = (T ∗u|v) = (u|T v) = (T v|u) .
(c) If u ∈H2, v ∈H1 then
(u|(αT + βS)v) = α(u|Tv) + β(u|Sv) = α(T ∗u|v) + β(S∗u|v) = ((αT ∗+ βS∗)u|v) .
The adjoint’s uniqueness gives (3.38). If v ∈H, u ∈H2,
(u|(T S)v) = (T ∗u|Sv) = ((S∗T ∗)u|v) .
By uniqueness (3.39) holds.
(d) It is enough to prove the ﬁrst identity, as the second one is a consequence of it and
of part (b). Since (T ∗u|v) = (u|T v), if v ∈Ker(T ) then (T ∗u|v) = 0 for any u ∈H2,
so v ∈[Ran(T ∗)]⊥. Conversely, still by (T ∗u|v) = (u|T v), if v ∈[Ran(T ∗)]⊥then
(u|T v) = 0 for any u ∈H2. If we choose u := T v then T v = 0 and so v ∈Ker(T ).
(e) If T is bijective then T −1 is bounded by Banach’s inverse operator theorem.
Therefore (T −1)∗exists. We have: T −1T = T T −1 = I. Using the second property
of (c) and remembering I ∗= I, let us compute the adjoint of both sides: T ∗(T −1)∗=
(T −1)∗T ∗= I. These are equivalent to saying T ∗is bijective and (T ∗)−1 = (T −1)∗.
Eventually, if T ∗is bijective, then also (T ∗)∗= T is bijective, by what we have just
seen and by (b).
□
Remark 3.39 The relationship between Hermitian adjoints and conjugate operators
seen in Deﬁnition 2.45 goes as follows. Start with T ∈B(H1, H2) and compute the
conjugate T ′ ∈B(H′
2, H′
1) and the adjoint T ∗∈B(H2, H1). Then:
(T ∗y f |x)1 = (y f |T x)2 = (T ′ f )(x) for any f ∈H′
2, x ∈H1,
where f ∈H′
2, while y f ∈H2 is the element in H2 representing f under Riesz’s
Theorem 3.16. As x ∈H1 is arbitrary, we may write:
T ′ f = (T ∗y f |
)1
for any f ∈H′
2.
(3.41)
Given that the Riesz map H′
2 ∋f →y f ∈H2 is bijective, the above equation
determines T ′ completely whenever T ∗is given, and conversely.

3.3.2
∗-Algebras, C∗-Algebras, and ∗-Representations
Hermitian conjugation gives us an excuse for introducing one of the most useful
mathematical concepts in advanced formulations of QM, namely C∗-algebras (also
known as B∗-algebras). We shall return to this notion in Chap.8 to discuss the

3.3 Hermitian Adjoints and Applications
135
spectral decomposition theorem, and in Chap.14, when we will deal with the so-
called algebraic formulation of quantum theories.
Deﬁnition 3.40 (C∗-algebra) Let A be a (commutative, Banach and unital) algebra
(normed by || ||) over the ﬁeld C. A map ∗: A →A such that:
I1. (antilinearity) (αx + βy)∗= αx∗+ βy∗for any x, y ∈A, α, β ∈C,
I2. (involutivity) (x∗)∗= x for any x ∈A,
I3. (xy)∗= y∗x∗for any x, y ∈A,
is called an involution, and the structure (A,∗) is a ∗-algebra (respectively commu-
tative, Banach, unital, normed).
A Banach ∗-algebra (with unit) is a C∗-algebra (with unit) if, further:
||x∗x|| = ||x||2 .
(3.42)
Given (unital) ∗-algebras A1 and A2, an algebra homomorphism f : A1 →A2 is a
∗-homomorphism if it preserves the involution: f (x∗1) = f (x)∗2 for any x ∈A1 (∗1
is the involution of A1 and ∗2 the involution in A2) and also the units, if present. We
call f a ∗-isomorphism if it is additionally bijective. A ∗-isomorphism f : A1 →A2
is called ∗-automorphism when A1 = A2.
An element x in a ∗-algebra A (with unit I in cases (iii), (iv) below) is called:
(i) normal if xx∗= x∗x,
(ii) Hermitian or self-adjoint if x∗= x,
(iii) isometric if x∗x = I,
(iv) unitary if x∗x = xx∗= I.
A ∗-subalgebra (C∗-subalgebra) of a ∗-algebra (C∗-algebra) A is the natural object:
a subalgebra that is a ∗-algebra (C∗-algebra) for the restricted involution (and for the
restricted Banach structure in case of a C∗-subalgebra). If the ∗-algebra (C∗-algebra)
has a unit, any ∗-subalgebra (C∗-subalgebra) with unit is required to have the same
unit of the ∗-algebra.
Remarks 3.41 (1) If A is a ∗-algebra (with unit), and {Ai}i∈I is a collection of ∗-
subalgebras (with unit), it is easy to see 
i∈i Ai is a ∗-subalgebra (with unit) of
A. If we add the topological structure and {Ai}i∈I are C∗-subalgebras (with unit)
of the C∗-algebra (with unit) A, then 
i∈i Ai is a C∗-subalgebra (with unit) of A.
Everything is completely obvious except possibly for the completeness of 
i∈i Ai.
This follows directly from the fact it is closed, hence complete, being an intersection
of closed (complete) sets Ai.
(2) If S ⊂A is a subset in a (unital) ∗-algebra A, the (unital) ∗-algebra generated
by S is the intersection of all (unital) ∗-subalgebras in A that contain S. The same
holds for (unital) C∗-algebras, mutatis mutandis.
(3) It is easy to prove that the inverse map of a ∗-isomorphism is a ∗-isomorphism as
well.

136

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
(4) The deﬁnition of involution ∗and C∗-algebra can be stated, almost identically, for
(associative) algebras over R instead of C. The only difference is that the involution is
R-linear and satisﬁes I2 and I3. This book will only deal with the complex versions. ■
Sometimes a ∗-homomorphism is deﬁned as a linear map preserving products and
involutions, but not necessarily units (when present), contrarily to our assumption.
However the following elementary result holds.
Proposition 3.42 Let A1, A2 be unital ∗-algebras and consider a linear map φ :
A1 →A2 that preserves the products and the involutions. If φ is surjective, then it
is a ∗-homomorphism.
Proof It is sufﬁcient to establish that φ preserves unit elements. With the obvious
notation, φ(a) = φ(I1a) = φ(I1)φ(a) for every a ∈A1. Since φ : A1 →A2 is
surjective, there exists a1 ∈A1 such that φ(a1) = I2, so I2 = φ(a1) = φ(I1)φ(a1) =
φ(I1)I2 = φ(I1).
□
Remark 3.43 Note that the proof remains valid irrespective of the involutions: a
product-preserving surjective linear map between unital algebras must also preserve
the units.
■
Before we return to B(H), let us see a few general features of ∗-algebras (and C∗-
algebras) that descend from the deﬁnition.
Proposition 3.44 Let A be a ∗-algebra with involution ∗.
(a) If (A, || ||) is a C∗-algebra and x ∈A is normal, then for any m = 1, 2, . . .:
||xm|| = ||x||m .
(b) If (A, || ||) is a C∗-algebra and x ∈A,
||x∗|| = ||x|| .
(c) If A has unit I, then I∗= I. Moreover, x ∈A has an inverse if and only if x∗has
an inverse, in which case (x−1)∗= (x∗)−1.
Proof (a) If ||x|| = 0 the claim is trivial, so assume x ̸= 0. A repeated use of (3.42),
I2, I3 and the fact that xx∗= x∗x gives:
||x2||2 = ||(x2)∗x2|| = ||(x∗)2x2|| = ||(x∗x)∗(x∗x)|| = ||x∗x||2 = (||x||2)2
whence ||x2|| = ||x||2 by norm positivity. Iterating we obtain ||x2k|| = ||x||2k for
any natural number k. If m = 3, 4, . . . there exist two natural numbers n, k with
m + n = 2k, so:
||x||m||x||n = ||x||n+m = ||xn+m|| ≤||xm|| ||xn|| ≤||xm|| ||x||n ≤||x||m||x||n .

3.3 Hermitian Adjoints and Applications
137
But then all inequalities are equalities, so in particular:
||xm|| ||x||n = ||x||m||x||n,
dividing which by ||x||n (non-zero since x ̸= 0 and ||·|| is a norm) proves the claim.
(b) Equation (3.42) implies ||x||2 = ||xx∗|| ≤||x|| ||x∗|| so ||x|| ≤||x∗||. Similarly
||x∗|| ≤||(x∗)∗||, and then (x∗)∗= x concludes this part.
(c) II∗= I∗by deﬁnition of unit; on the other hand II∗= (I∗)∗I∗= (I∗I)∗. From
these two descends I∗= (I∗I)∗= (I∗)∗= I. The other statement follows from this,
I2 and the uniqueness of the inverse.
□
It is easy to construct a C∗-algebra out of a family of C∗-algebras with the following
procedure.
Proposition 3.45 Let {A j} j∈J be a family of C∗-algebras, not necessarily unital,
where J has arbitrary cardinality. Consider the set 
j∈J A j ⊂× j∈JA j of families
{a j} j∈J, such that
				{a j} j∈J
				 := sup
j∈J
||a j|| j < +∞.
(3.43)
Equip 
j∈J A j with a ∗-algebra structure by declaring (with obvious notation)
(i) α{a j} j∈J + β{a′
j} j∈J := {αa j + βa′
j} j∈J with α, β ∈C,
(ii) {a j} j∈J ◦{a′
j} j∈J := {a j ◦j a′
j} j∈J,
(iii) {a j}∗
j∈J := {a
∗j
j } j∈J,
Under these assumptions, (3.43) deﬁnes a norm making 
j∈J A j a C∗-algebra. If
every A j is unital, I := {I j} j∈J is the unit of this C∗-algebra.
Proof The argument is straightforward. The completeness of 
j∈J A j as a Banach
space is essentially the same as the completeness of C(K, Kn) (Proposition 2.18) or
any other space of C-valued, bounded functions. The C∗relation
				{ak}∗
k∈J ◦{a j} j∈J
				 =
				{a j} j∈J
				2
descends immediately from the C∗property of each C∗-algebra A j and the given
deﬁnitions.
□
Deﬁnition 3.46 The C∗-algebra 
j∈J A j constructed in Proposition 3.45 is called
direct sum of the family of C∗-algebras {A j} j∈J. An element of 
j∈J A j is denoted
by ⊕ja j := {a j} j∈J.
Remark 3.47 The structure of a C∗-algebra is remarkable in that its topological and
algebraic properties are deeply intertwined. We will prove later (Corollary 8.18)
that a ∗-homomorphism φ : A →B between unital C∗-algebras is automatically
continuous, because ||φ(a)||B ≤||a||A for any a ∈A. Moreover, φ is isometric, i.e.
||φ(a)||B = ||a||A for any a ∈A, if and only if it is injective (Theorem 8.22).

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
Examples 3.48 (1) The Banach algebras of complex-valued functions seen in Exam-
ples 2.29(2), (3), (4), (8) and (9) are all instances of commutative C∗-algebras whose
involution is the complex conjugation of functions.
(2) By virtue of (a), (b), (c) in Proposition 3.38 we have this result.
Theorem 3.49 If H is Hilbert space, B(H) is a C∗-algebra with unit if the involution
is deﬁned as the Hermitian conjugation.
(3) The algebra H of quaternions is a 4-dimensional real vector space with a priv-
ileged basis {1, i, j, k}. It is equipped with a product that turns it into an R-algebra
with unit, given by the basis element 1. The product is determined, keeping in mind
Deﬁnition 2.24, by the relations ii = j j = kk = −1, i j = −ji = k, jk = −kj = i,
ki = −ik = j.
As R identiﬁes naturally with the Abelian subalgebra of elements the form a1,
a ∈R, the algebra H can be viewed as a real normed algebra with unit: it is enough
to think real numbers as quaternions, and deﬁne the product of a real scalar by a
quaternion using the product in H. The norm is the usual Euclidean norm for the
standard basis of H, namely ||a1+bi +cj +dk|| :=
√
a2 + b2 + c2 + d2. It is easy
to check that H becomes thus a real Banach algebra with unit. Although the ground
ﬁeld is R, it is possible to deﬁne an involution on H via quaternionic conjugation:
(a1+bi+cj+dk)∗= a1−bi−cj−dk,witha, b, c, d ∈R.Thentheusualproperties
of involutions hold (the ﬁeld is real, so the involution is R-linear), in relation to the
norm too, and also the property typical of C∗-algebras: ||a∗a|| = ||a||2. Product and
norm are linked by the rule ||ab|| = ||a|| ||b||, a, b ∈H, reminiscent of the modulus
on C and the absolute value on R. A further property, shared by R and C as well,
is that the quaternion algebra is a real associative division algebra: an associative
algebra with multiplicative unit different from the additive neutral element where
any non-zero element is invertible.
A concrete representation of H is given by the real subalgebra of M(2, C)
(2 × 2 complex matrices) spanned over R by the identity I and the three Pauli
matrices −iσ1, −iσ2, −iσ3: these correspond to the quaternionic units 1 and i, j, k
(see Remark 7.28(3)).
Hence H is also a (non-commutative) division ring, that is a non-trivial ring where
every non-zero element admits a multiplicative inverse. A commutative division ring
is obviously a ﬁeld, just like R and C.
In 1887 Frobenius proved what has become a classical result.
Theorem 3.50 (Frobenius) A ﬁnite-dimensional associative division algebra over
R is necessarily isomorphic to R, C or H.
Amuchmorerecentresult[UrWr60],extendingapreviousclassicalresultbyHurwitz
(where also a ﬁnite dimension was assumed), replaces ﬁnite-dimensionality for a
demand on the norm.

3.3 Hermitian Adjoints and Applications
139
Theorem 3.51 An associative, unital normed division algebra A over R such that
||ab|| = ||a|| ||b||, a, b ∈A, is necessarily isometrically isomorphic to R, C or H.
Such A is therefore ﬁnite-dimensional, Banach and can be turned into a real C∗-
algebra using the isomorphism. If one demands ||ab|| = ||a|| ||b|| in the ﬁnite-
dimensional case, as established by Hurwitz (and published posthumously in 1923),
dropping associativity adds to the list only one other instance, the Cayley numbers,
also known as octonions. The inﬁnite-dimensional non-associative case is more com-
plicated [UrWr60].
■
To conclude the section let us see a very relevant deﬁnition in advanced formalisations
of, for example, quantum ﬁeld theories. We will come back to these notions later,
especially in Chap.14.
Deﬁnition 3.52 Let A be a ∗-algebra (not necessarily unital, nor C∗) and H a Hilbert
space. A ∗-homomorphism π : A →B(H) is called a representation of A on H.
(Note π preserves units if present.) Furthermore, one says that
(a) π is faithful if it is one-to-one;
(b) a subspace M ⊂H is invariant under π (or π-invariant) if π(a)(M) ⊂M for
any a ∈A.
(c) π is irreducible if there are no π-invariant closed subspaces other than {0} and
H itself.
(d) If π′ : A →B(H′) is another representation of A on H′, π and π′ are said to be
unitarily equivalent:
π ≃π′
if there exists a surjective isometry U : H →H′ such that:
Uπ(a)U −1 = π′(a) for any a ∈A.
(e) A vector ψ ∈H is called cyclic for π if {π(a)ψ | a ∈A} = H.
Remarks 3.53 (1) One can also consider representations of ∗-algebras in terms of
unbounded operators and operators deﬁned on a common invariant domain of the
Hilbert space.
(2) In case A is a C∗-algebra with unit, every representation is automatically con-
tinuous with respect to the norm of A on the domain and the operator norm on
the codomain, as ||π(a)|| ≤||a|| for any a ∈A. Then π is faithful iff isometric:
||π(a)|| = ||a|| for any a ∈A. All this will be proved in Theorem 8.22.
(3) With our deﬁnition of representation, the map A ∋a →0 is a representation
called the zero representation (also known as the trivial representation) in two
cases only: either the ∗-algebra A has no unit, or H = {0}. This is because our def-
inition requires π(I) = I, but I ̸= 0 when H ̸= {0}. If one drops the requirement
π(I) = I in the deﬁnition of a representation, the zero representation makes sense
also for unital ∗-algebras and H ̸= {0}.
■
Here is an elementary yet important fact.

140
3
Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
Proposition 3.54 If π : A →B(H) is an irreducible representation of a ∗-algebra
A with unit on H ̸= {0}, then every non-zero vector in H is cyclic for π.
Proof If ψ ̸= 0, deﬁne Mψ := {π(a)ψ | a ∈A}. Since every π(b) is bounded,
necessarily π(b)(Mψ) ⊂Mψ for every b ∈A, and therefore either Mψ = H or
Mψ = {0} because π is irreducible. The second case is excluded, as it would imply
π(a) = 0 for every a ∈A and in particular π(I) = 0 ̸= I (because H ̸= {0}) which
is impossible by deﬁnition of representation of unital ∗-algebra.
□
Deﬁnition 3.52 explicitly requires that a representation map the unit of the algebra
to the identity operator: π(I) = I. The reader should pay attention to this fact, since
some books do not impose π(I) = I when deﬁning representations of ∗-algebras with
unit (see Proposition 3.42 for the analogous issue regarding ∗-homomorphisms). The
two inequivalent deﬁnitions are related by the following elementary result, whose
proof requires the mathematical technology presented in Sect.3.4 and which appears
in the solution of Exercise 3.32.
Proposition 3.55 Let A be a ∗-algebra with unit, H a Hilbert space, and consider a
linear map φ : A →B(H) which preserves the products and the involutions. Then
(a) Hφ := Ran(φ(I)) and H⊥
φ are closed subspaces of H satisfying H = Hφ ⊕H⊥
φ ,
and each one is invariant under φ(a) for every a ∈A.
(b) φ(a)↾H⊥
φ = 0 for every a ∈A.
(c) The restriction to the complement
πφ : A ∋a →φ(a)↾Hφ∈B(Hφ)
is a representation of A over Hφ according to Deﬁnition 3.52. It also satisﬁes
(i) πφ is faithful ⇔φ is injective;
(ii) πφ is the zero representation ⇔φ(I) = 0 (in this case Hφ = {0});
(iii) πφ = φ if φ is surjective;
(iv) πφ = φ if φ is not the zero map and is irreducible (i.e. there are no closed
subspaces {0} ⊊M ⊊H such that φ(a)(M) ⊂M for every a ∈A).
Proof See the solution of Exercise 3.32.
□
3.3.3
Normal, Self-Adjoint, Isometric, Unitary and Positive
Operators
Returning to the C∗-algebra B(H) (or more generally to B(H, H1)), we recall the
most important types of operators we will encounter in subsequent chapters.
Deﬁnition 3.56 Let (H, (|)), (H1, (|)1) be Hilbert spaces and IH, IH1 their respective
identity operators.
(a) T ∈B(H) is said to be normal if TT ∗= T ∗T .

3.3 Hermitian Adjoints and Applications
141
(b) T ∈B(H) is self-adjoint if T = T ∗.
(c) T ∈L(H, H1) is isometric if bounded and T ∗T = IH; equivalently, T ∈
L(H, H1) is isometric if (T x|T y)1 = (x|y) for any pair x, y ∈H.
(d) T ∈L(H, H1) is unitary if bounded, T ∗T = IH and T T ∗= IH1; equivalently,
T ∈L(H, H1) is unitary if it is isometric and onto, i.e. an isomorphism of Hilbert
spaces.
(e) T ∈L(H) is positive, written T ≥0, if (u|T u) ≥0 for any u ∈H.
(f) If U ∈L(H), we write T ≥U in case T −U ≥0.
Remarks 3.57 (1) Let us comment on the equivalence in (c): if T ∈B(H, H1)
and T ∗T = IH, then (T x|T y)1 = (x|y) for any pair x, y ∈H, since (x|y) =
(x|T ∗T y) = (T x|T y)1. On the other hand, if T ∈L(H, H1) and (T x|T y)1 = (x|y)
for any x, y ∈H, then T is bounded (set y = x), so T ∗is well deﬁned. At last
T ∗T = IH, because (x|T ∗T y) = (T x|T y)1 = (x|y) for any pair x, y ∈H, so in
particular (x|(T ∗T −I)y) = 0 with x = (T ∗T −I)y.
As for the equivalence in (d), notice that any isometric operator T is obviously
injective, for T u = 0 implies ||u|| = 0 and hence u = 0. Thus surjectivity is
equivalent to the existence of a right inverse that coincides with the left inverse (the
latter exists by injectivity, and equals T ∗). From this it follows immediately that
T ∗T = IH and T T ∗= IH1 are together equivalent to saying that T ∈L(H, H1) is
isometric (hence bounded) and surjective. Our deﬁnition of a unitary operator agrees
with Deﬁnition 3.10.
(2) There exist isometric operators in B(H) that are not unitary (this cannot happen
if H has ﬁnite dimension). For instance, the operator on ℓ2(N):
A : (z0, z1, z2, . . .) →(0, z0, z1, , . . .) ,
for any (z0, z1, z2, . . .) ∈ℓ2(N).
(3) Unitary and self-adjoint operators in B(H) are normal, but not conversely in
general.
■
To close the section we consider properties of normal, self-adjoint, unitary and pos-
itive operators on one Hilbert space. First, though, a deﬁnition that should be known
from elementary courses.
Deﬁnition 3.58 Let X be a vector space over K = C, or R, and take T ∈L(X). The
number λ ∈K is an eigenvalue of T if:
T u = λu
(3.44)
for some u ∈X \ {0} called an eigenvector of T relative (or associated) to λ.
The subspace of X made of the null vector and all eigenvectors relative to a given
eigenvalue λ is called the eigenspace of T with eigenvalue λ (of, associated to,
relative to λ).

142

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
Notation 3.59 Only to avoid cumbersome and long sentences we shall also adopt
the terms λ-eigenvector and λ-eigenspace for eigenvectors and eigenspaces relative
to a given eigenvalue λ.
■
Now here is the proposition summarising the aforementioned properties.
Proposition 3.60 Let (H, ( | )) be a Hilbert space.
(a) If T ∈B(H) is self-adjoint:
||T || = sup {|(x|T x)| | x ∈H , ||x|| = 1} .
(3.45)
More generally, if T ∈L(H) satisﬁes (x|T x) = (T x|x) for any x ∈H and the
right-hand side of (3.45) is ﬁnite, then T is bounded.
(b) If T ∈B(H) is normal (in particular self-adjoint or unitary):
(i) λ ∈C is an eigenvalue of T with eigenvector u ⇔λ is an eigenvalue for T ∗
with the same eigenvector u;
(ii) eigenspaces of T relative to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal;
(iii) the relation:
||T x|| = ||T ∗x|| for any x ∈H
(3.46)
holds, so Ker(T) = Ker(T ∗) and Ran(T ) = Ran(T ∗).
(c) Let T ∈L(H):
(i) if T is positive, its possible eigenvalues are real and non-negative;
(ii) if T is bounded and self-adjoint, its possible eigenvalues are real;
(iii) if T is isometric (in particular unitary), its possible eigenvalues are unit
complex numbers.
(d) If T ∈L(H) satisﬁes (y|T x) = (T y|x) for any pair x, y ∈H, then T is bounded
and self-adjoint.
(e) If T ∈B(H) satisﬁes (x|T x) = (T x|x) for any x ∈H, T is self-adjoint.
(f) If T ∈B(H) is positive, it is self-adjoint.
(g) The relation ≥is a partial order on L(H) (hence on B(H)).
Proof (a) Set Q := sup {|(x|T x)| | x ∈H , ||x|| = 1}. Since we take ||x|| = 1
|(x|T x)| ≤||T x||||x|| ≤||T x|| ≤||T|| ,
hence Q ≤||T||. To conclude it sufﬁces to show ||T|| ≤Q. The immediate identity
4(x|T y) = (x + y|T (x + y))−(x −y|T(x −y))−i(x +iy|T(x +iy))+i(x −iy|T(x −iy)),
together with the fact that (z|T z) = (T z|z) = (z|T z), allow to rephrase 4Re(x|T y)
= 2(x|T y) + 2(x|T y) as:
4Re(x|T y) = (x + y|T (x + y)) −(x −y|T (x −y)) ≤Q||x + y||2 + Q||x −y||2
= 2Q||x||2 + 2Q||y||2 .

3.3 Hermitian Adjoints and Applications
143
Thus we proved:
4Re(x|T y) ≤2Q||x||2 + 2Q||y||2 .
Let y ∈H, ||y|| = 1. If T y = 0, it is clear that ||T y|| ≤Q; otherwise, deﬁne
x := T y/||T y|| and we obtain the above inequality:
4||T y|| = 4Re(x|T y) ≤2Q(||x||2 + ||y||2) = 2Q(1 + 1) = 4Q,
from which ||T y|| ≤Q once again. Overall, ||T y|| ≤Q if ||y|| = 1, so
||T || = sup{||T y|| | y ∈H , ||y|| = 1} ≤Q .
The more general statement follows from the second part of the above proof (||T|| ≤
Q).
(b)(iii). The claim follows from the observation that T T ∗= T ∗T implies ||T x||2 =
(T x|T x) = (x|T ∗T x) = (x|T T ∗x) = ||T ∗x||2. The remaining identities are now
obvious, in the light of Proposition 3.38(d). Let us prove (i). As T −λI is normal
with adjoint T ∗−λI, (iii) gives
||T u −λu|| = ||T ∗u −λu||
and the claim is proved. (ii) Let u be a λ-eigenvector of T , v a μ-eigenvector of T .
By (i), λ(v|u) = (v|T u) = (T ∗v|u) = (μv|u) = μ(v|u), so (λ −μ)(v|u) = 0. But
λ ̸= μ, so (v|u) = 0.
(c) If T ≥0 and T u = λu with u ̸= 0, then 0 ≤(u|T u) = λ(u|u), and since
(u|u) > 0, λ ≥0. Let now T = T ∗and T u = λu with u ̸= 0. Then λ(u|u) =
(u|T u) = (T u|u) = λ(u|u). From (u|u) ̸= 0 we have λ = λ, i.e. λ ∈R. If, instead,
T is isometric, (u|u) = (T u|T u) = |λ|2(u|u), so |λ| = 1 as u ̸= 0.
(d) It is enough to prove T is bounded. The adjoint’s uniqueness implies that T = T ∗
because (y|T x) = (T y|x) for any pair x, y ∈H. By the closed graph Theorem 2.99,
to prove T bounded we can just show it is closed. Let then {xn}n∈N ⊂H be a sequence
converging to x and suppose the vectors T xn form a converging sequence: the claim
is T xn →T x. Given y ∈H, our assumptions imply
(y|T xn) = (T y|xn) →(T y|x) = (y|T x) .
The inner product is continuous, and by hypothesis limn→+∞T xn exists, so

y

n→+∞(T x −T xn)

= 0 .
Given that y is arbitrary, by choosing precisely y := limn→+∞(T x −T xn) we obtain
limn→+∞(T x −T xn) = 0.

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
(e)–(f) We have ((T ∗−T )x|x) = 0 for any x ∈H. By Exercise 3.21 T ∗−T = 0 i.e.
T = T ∗. If T ∈B(H) is positive, then (x|T x) is real and coincides with its complex
conjugate (T x|x) (by the properties of the inner product), so we fall back into the
previous case.
(g) We have to prove three things. (i) T ≥T : this is obvious because it means
((T −T )x|x) ≥0 for any x ∈H. (ii) if T ≥U and U ≥S then T ≥S:
this is immediate by noting T −S = (T −U) + (U −S), so ((T −S)x|x) =
((T −U)x|x) + ((U −S)x|x) ≥0 for any x ∈H, since T ≥U and U ≥S. (iii) if
T ≥U and U ≥T then T = U. For this last one notice (x|(T −U)x) = 0 for any
x ∈H. Exercise 3.21 forces T −U = 0, so T = U.
□
Remark 3.61 On real Hilbert spaces the relation ≥is not a partial order, because
A ≥0 and 0 ≥A do not imply A = 0. For example consider a skew-symmetric
matrix A acting on Rn (seen as real vector space with the ordinary inner product).
Then A ≥0 and also 0 ≥A, since (x|Ax) = 0 for any x ∈Rn, but A can be very
different from the null matrix.

3.4
Orthogonal Structures and Partial Isometries
In this section we introduce further mathematical structures related to the notions of
isometry and orthogonality in a Hilbert space.
3.4.1
Orthogonal Projectors
The elementary notion we wish to introduce is that of orthogonal projectors, which
will play a role to construct the formalism of QM.
Deﬁnition 3.62 (Orthogonal projector) If (H, ( | )) is a Hilbert space, a projector
P ∈B(H) (Deﬁnition 2.100) is called an orthogonal projector if P∗= P.
Remark 3.63 With this in place, orthogonal projectors are precisely the bounded
operators H →H deﬁned by P = PP (P is idempotent) and P = P∗(P is self-
adjoint). An immediate consequence is their positivity: for any x ∈H
(u|Pu) = (u|P Pu) = (P∗u|Pu) = (Pu|Pu) = ||Pu||2 ≥0 .
■
The next couple of propositions characterise orthogonal projectors.
Proposition 3.64 Let H be a Hilbert space and P ∈B(H) an orthogonal projector
onto a subspace M (necessarily closed by Proposition 2.101(b)). Then
(a) Q := I −P is an orthogonal projector.

3.4 Orthogonal Structures and Partial Isometries
145
(b) Q(H) = M⊥, so the direct sum decomposition associated to P and Q, as of
Proposition 2.101(b), is given by M and its orthogonal M⊥:
H = M ⊕M⊥.
(c) For any x ∈H, ||x −P(x)|| = min{||x −y|| | y ∈M}.
(d) If N is a basis on M, then:
Px =

u∈N
(u|x)u ,
x ∈H .
(e) I ≥P; moreover, ||P|| = 1 if P is not the null operator (the projector onto {0}).
Proof (a) We know already that Q := I −P is a projector (Proposition 2.4). By
Proposition 3.38(c), since I ∗= I, we have Q∗= Q, so Q is an orthogonal projector.
(b) By Proposition 2.101(b) it is enough to show Q(H) = M⊥. For that notice that
if x ∈Q(H) and y ∈M, then (x|y) = (Qx|y) = (x|Qy) = (x|y −Py) =
(x|y −y) = 0, so Q(H) ⊂M⊥. We claim M⊥⊂Q(H), hence M⊥= Q(H). By
Proposition 2.101, we have a direct sum:
H = M ⊕Q(H)
At the same time Theorem 3.13(d) gives the (orthogonal) decomposition:
H = M ⊕M⊥.
If y ∈M⊥, the ﬁrst decomposition induces y = yM + z with yM ∈M and z ∈Q(H).
As we saw, Q(H) ⊂M⊥, so the uniqueness of the above splitting implies that
y = yM + z must also be the decomposition of y induced by H = M ⊕M⊥. Thus
yM ∈M and z ∈M⊥. Then by assumption yM = 0, and y = z ∈Q(H). Since
y ∈M⊥is arbitrary, we have proved M⊥⊂Q(H).
(c) The statement is a straightforward consequence of Theorem 3.13(d) when K :=
M, because the decomposition is unique.
(d) We may extend N to a basis of H by adding a basis N ′ of M⊥(in fact N ∪N ′ is
an orthonormal system by construction; moreover, part (b) gives H = M ⊕M⊥, so
any x ∈H orthogonal to both N and N ′ must be null. Then, by deﬁnition, N ∪N ′
is basis for H.) We can immediately verify that, varying x ∈H,
Rx =

u∈N
(u|x)u
and
R′x =

u∈N ′
(u|x)u

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
deﬁne bounded operators (at most countably many products (u|x) are non-zero for
every ﬁxed x ∈H), and they satisfy RR = R, R(H) = M, R′R′ = R′, R′(H) = M⊥
and also R′R = RR′ = 0 and R + R′ = I. By Proposition 2.101 R and R′ are
projectors associated to M ⊕M⊥. By uniqueness of the decomposition of any vector
we must have R = P (and R′ = Q).
(e) Q = I −P is an orthogonal projector such that:
0 ≤(Qx|Qx) = (x|QQx) = (x|Qx) = (x|I x) −(x|Px) ,
for any x ∈H. This means I ≥P. What we have just seen also implies
||Px||2 = (Px|Px) = (x|P Px) = (x|Px) ≤(x|x) = ||x||2 .
Therefore taking the supremum over all x with ||x|| = 1 yields ||P|| ≤1. If P ̸= 0,
there will be a unit vector x ∈H so that Px = x, hence ||Px|| = 1. If so, ||P|| = 1.
□
Proposition 3.65 Let H be a Hilbert space and M ⊂H a closed subspace. The
projectors P and Q that decompose H = M ⊕M⊥as in Proposition 2.102 (with
N := M⊥), and project onto M and M⊥respectively, are orthogonal.
Proof It is enough to prove P = P∗. That Q = Q∗follows from Q = I −P.
If x ∈H we have a unique decomposition x = y + z, y = P(x) ∈M and
z = Q(x) ∈M⊥. Let x′ = y′ + z′ be the analogous splitting of x′ ∈H. Then
(x′|Px) = (y′ + z′|y) = (y′|y). We also have (Px′|x) = (y′|y + z) = (y′|y),
hence (x′|Px) = (Px′|x) i.e. ((P∗−P)x′|x) = 0 for any x, x′ ∈H. By choosing
x = (P∗−P)x′ we obtain Px′ = P∗x′ for any x′, so P = P∗.
□
Our last result characterises commuting orthogonal projections.
Proposition 3.66 Two orthogonal projectors P ̸= 0 and P′ ̸= 0 on a Hilbert space
H commute,
P P′ = P′P,
if and only if there exists a Hilbert basis N of H such that, for every ﬁxed x ∈H:
Px =

u∈NP
(u|x)u and, simultaneously,
P′x =

u∈NP′
(u|x)u,
for some pair of subsets NP, NP′ ⊂N.
Proof If Px = 
u∈NP(u|x)u and P′ = 
u∈NP′(u|x)u for subsets NP, NP′ ⊂N,
where N is a basis in H, then trivially P P′ = P′P, as a direct computation, involving
the orthogonality relations of u ∈N, shows. Conversely, assume P P′ = P′P. If
M := P(H), it is not hard to see P′(M) ⊂M and P′(M⊥) ⊂M⊥. Moreover, P′↾M
and P′↾M⊥are orthogonal projectors on Hilbert spaces M and M⊥respectively, and

3.4 Orthogonal Structures and Partial Isometries
147
in addition P′ = P′↾M ⊕P′↾M⊥, corresponding to H = M ⊕M⊥. By Proposition
3.64(d) (as any orthonormal system can be completed to a basis) we can ﬁx bases
NM of M and NM⊥of M⊥such that, for suitable subsets N ′
M ⊂NM, N ′
M⊥⊂NM⊥,
with obvious notation,
P′↾M=

u∈N ′
M
u(u| ) ,
P′↾M⊥=

v∈N ′
M⊥
v(v| ) .
Therefore
P′ = P′↾M ⊕P′↾M⊥=

w∈N ′
M∪N ′
M⊥
w(w| ) .
By construction, from H = M ⊕M⊥we have that NM ∪NM⊥is a basis of H, and
Px =

w∈NM
(w|x)w ,
x ∈H
again from Proposition 3.64(d). The basis N := NM ∪NM⊥of H satisﬁes the require-
ments once we set NP := NM and NP′ := N ′
M ∪N ′
M⊥.
□
3.4.2
Hilbert Sum of Hilbert Spaces
The notion of direct Hilbert sum of a family of Hilbert spaces plays a relevant role
in many technical constructions. We discuss here the most general case where the
family’s cardinality may be arbitrary.
Deﬁnition 3.67 (Hilbert sum of Hilbert spaces) Let {(H j, (·|·) j} j∈J be a family of
arbitrary cardinality of Hilbert spaces H j ̸= {0} for every j ∈J.
The (direct orthogonal) Hilbert sum of the Hilbert spaces H j is the Hilbert
space 
j∈J H j formed by families of vectors {ψ j} j∈J ∈× j∈JH j such that

j∈J
||ψ j||2
j < +∞
(3.47)
(in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.19). The linear structure is deﬁned by
α{ψ j} j∈J + β{φ j} j∈J := {αψ j + βφ j} j∈J
α, β ∈C ,
and the inner product:

{ψ j} j∈J
		{φ j} j∈J

:=

j∈J
(ψa |φa ) j .
(3.48)

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
An element {ψ j} j∈J ∈⊕j∈JH j is denoted by ⊕j∈Jψ j.
Remark 3.68 (1) We shall typically use the same symbol 
α∈A Hα for both the
ordinary direct sum and the Hilbert sum, since the nature of the structure in question
will be clear from the context.
(2) In the ﬁnite case J = {1, . . . , n}, the simpler notation
H1 ⊕· · · ⊕Hn :=

j∈J
H j
and
ψ1 ⊕· · · ⊕ψn := ⊕j∈Jψ j
are more common.
(3) When J is ﬁnite, condition (3.47) is automatically true, so H1⊕· · ·⊕Hn coincides
with the product H1 × · · · × Hn equipped with the natural component-wise linear
structure and the standard inner product
(v1 ⊕· · · ⊕vn|u1 ⊕· · · ⊕un) :=
n

i=1
(vi|ui)i
which makes it a Hilbert space. It is easy to show that the topology of Hilbert space
on H1 × · · · × Hn coincides with the product topology of the factors Hi.
■
Irrespective of the cardinality of J in Deﬁnition 3.67, we have
Proposition 3.69 The Hilbert space 
j∈J H j is well deﬁned.
Proof First of all, if vectors ⊕j∈Jψ j, ⊕j∈Jφ j satisfy (3.47), their inner product (3.48)
is well deﬁned (it complies with Deﬁnition 3.1). This is because there are at most
countably many non-vanishing pairs (ψ jn, ψ jn), so the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality
can be exploited to achieve

j∈J
|(ψ j|φ j) j| =

n∈N
|(ψ jn|φ jn) jn| ≤

n
||ψ jn|| jn||φ jn|| jn ≤

j∈J
||ψ j||2
j

i∈J
||φi||2
i < +∞.
In particular, the sum (3.48), which is actually a series (or a ﬁnite sum), converges
absolutely and can be rearranged.
The only nontrivial fact to check is the completeness of 
j∈J H j, so let us prove it.
Consider a Cauchy sequence {⊕j∈Jψ jn}n∈N. Since 
j∈J ||ψ jn||2
j < +∞for every
n, there is only a ﬁnite or countable set of indices j with ψ jn ̸= 0 for every ﬁxed n.
Hence the full set of j ∈J such that ψ jn ̸= 0 for some n ∈N is at most countable,
and we call them jk with k ∈N (the ﬁnite case being a trivial subcase). Thus we
reduce to dealing with a countable family {ψ jkn}n,k∈N. The remaining vectors ψ jn
necessarily vanish. For every ε > 0 there exists Nε with

3.4 Orthogonal Structures and Partial Isometries
149
|| ⊕j∈J ψ jn −⊕j∈Jψ jm||2 =

k∈N
||ψ jkn −ψ jkm||2 < ε2
(3.49)
for n, m > Nε. In particular, for a ﬁxed k, we have ||ψ jkn−ψ jkm||2 < ε2 if n, m > Nε.
Since H jk is complete, ψ jkn →ψ jk ∈H jk as n →+∞and, from (3.49),
N

k=0
||ψ jkn −ψ jkm||2 < ε2
(3.50)
Taking ﬁrst the limit as m →∞and then as N →+∞in (3.50) we ﬁnd
|| ⊕j∈J ψ jn −⊕j∈Jψ j||2 =

k∈N
||ψ jkn −ψ jk||2 < ε2
(3.51)
for n > Nε, where we deﬁned ⊕j∈Jψ j to have components ψ jk, or ψ j = 0 when
j /∈{ jk}k∈N. Condition (3.51) proves that ⊕j∈Jψ jn →⊕j∈Jψ j as n →+∞
provided ⊕j∈Jψ j ∈
j∈J H j. This is the case because:

j∈J
||ψ j||2 =

k∈N
||ψ jk||2 ≤

k∈N
(||ψ jkn|| + ||ψ jkn −ψ jk||)2


k∈N
||ψ jkn −ψ jk||2 + 2

k∈N
||ψ jkn|| ||ψ jkn −ψ jk||
≤|| ⊕j∈J ψ jn||2 + ε2 + 2|| ⊕j∈J ψ jn||

k∈N
||ψ jkn −ψ jk||2
= (|| ⊕j∈J ψ jn|| + ε)2 < +∞,
if n > Nε.
□
The summands H j in a Hilbert sum are naturally identiﬁed with (non-trivial) closed
subspaces of 
j∈J H j itself, and H j ⊥Hi if i ̸= j. The converse is true too, for we
have the following proposition.
Proposition 3.70 Let H be a Hilbert space and {Hα}α∈A a collection of arbitrary
cardinality of closed subspaces such that
(i) Hα ̸= {0} for every α ∈A,
(ii) Hα ⊥Hβ if α, β ∈A with α ̸= β.
Then

α∈A
Hα
is isomorphic to < {Hα}α∈A >
(3.52)
under the map

L : < {Hα}α∈A > ∋ψ
→⊕α∈A Pαψ ∈

α∈A
Hα ,
(3.53)
where Pα : H →H is the orthogonal projector onto Hα, for every α ∈A.
Proof Take a Hilbert basis Nα ⊂Hα, for every α ∈A. The orthonormal set N :=
∪α∈ANα is a Hilbert basis of the closed subspace < {Hα}α∈A > because the span of
N is dense therein. If we take ψ ∈< {Hα}α∈A >, then
||ψ||2 =

z∈N
|(z|ψ)|2
where, as usual, only a ﬁnite, or countable, set of summands are strictly positive.
Thus, interpreting the sum as an integral for the counting measure on N, we may use
the dominated convergence theorem and safely rearrange the sum as
||ψ||2 =

α∈A

z∈Na
|(z|ψ)|2 ,
In other words,
||ψ||2 =

α∈A
||Pαψ||2 .
This identity proves at once that the linear map L in (3.53) is both well deﬁned and
isometric. To prove that L is a Hilbert space isomorphism it is enough to show it is
surjective. If {φα}α∈A ∈⊕α∈AHα, we have 
α∈A ||φα||2 < ∞by hypothesis, so that
φ := 
α∈A φα exists in H in view of Lemma 3.25 (again, only a ﬁnite or countable
number of φα do not vanish, and φα ⊥φβ for α ̸= β). Moreover φ ∈< {Hα}α∈A >,
since φ is a limit of elements in the span of {Hα}α∈A. Evidently Lφ = {φα}α∈A.
□
Notation 3.71 In the rest of the book, under the assumptions of Proposition 3.70, we
shall often write 
α∈A Hα in place of < {Hα}α∈A >, since the isomorphism between
the two spaces is canonical.
■
From the proof of Proposition 3.70 we can extract the identity
||Pψ||2 =

α∈A
||Pαψ||2
for every ψ ∈H ,
(3.54)
where P is the orthogonal projector onto ⊕α∈AHα viewed as a subspace of H in
accordance with Proposition 3.70. All norms refer to H, and Pα ̸= 0 is the orthogonal
projector onto Hα for any α ∈A. Note that Pα ⊥Pβ if α ̸= β, forcing the map
A ∋α →Pα to be injective, as Pα ̸= 0. Furthermore, we also found the other useful
relation
Pψ =

α∈A

for every ψ ∈H ,

3.4 Orthogonal Structures and Partial Isometries

where the series may be rearranged arbitrarily. The sum is a standard (inﬁnite) series
or a ﬁnite sum, since at most countably many terms Pαψ do not vanish (Proposition
3.21(b)). If A is countable, as when H is separable and inﬁnite-dimensional, (3.55)
can be interpreted as a series in the strong operator topology
P = s-

a∈A
Pa .
(3.56)
3.4.3
Partial Isometries
We can pass to the useful notion of a partial isometry, a weaker version of the
isometries seen earlier.
Deﬁnition 3.72 A bounded operator U : H →H, with H a Hilbert space, is a
partial isometry when:
||Ux|| = ||x|| ,
for x ∈[Ker(U)]⊥.
If so, [Ker(U)]⊥is called the initial space of U and Ran(U) the ﬁnal space.
Any unitary operator U : H →H is a special partial isometry whose initial and ﬁnal
spaces coincide with the entire Hilbert space H. Observe also that if U : H →H
is a partially isometric operator then H decomposes orthogonally into Ker(U) ⊕
[Ker(U)]⊥, and U restricts to an honest isometry on the second summand (with
values in Ran(U)), while it is null on the ﬁrst summand. This self-evident fact can
be made stronger by proving that Ran(U) is closed, hence showing U ↾[Ker(U)]⊥:
[Ker(U)]⊥→Ran(U) is indeed a unitary operator between Hilbert spaces (closed
subspaces in H). The second statement in the ensuing proposition shows U ∗is a
partial isometry if U is, and its initial and ﬁnal spaces are those of U, but swapped.
Proposition 3.73 Let U : H →H be a partial isometry on the Hilbert space. Then
(a) Ran(U) is closed.
(b) U ∗: H →H is a partial isometry with initial space Ran(U) and ﬁnal space
[Ker(U)]⊥.
Proof (a) Let y ∈Ran(U) \ {0} (if H = {0} the proof of the whole proposition
is trivial). There is a sequence of vectors xn ∈[Ker(U)]⊥such that Uxn →y as
n →+∞. Since ||U(xn −xm)|| = ||xn −xm|| by deﬁnition of partial isometry, the
sequence xn is Cauchy and converges to some x ∈H. By continuity y = Ux, so
y ∈Ran(U). But y = 0 clearly belongs to Ran(U), so we have proved Ran(U)
contains all its limits points, and as such it is closed.
(b) Begin by observing Ker(U ∗) = Ran(U) and Ran(U ∗) = [Ker(U)]⊥by Propo-
sition 3.38, so if we use part (a) there remains only to prove U ∗is an isometry when
restricted to Ran(U). Notice preliminarily that if z, z′ ∈[Ker(U)]⊥, U being a
partial isometry implies:

||z + z′||2 −||z −z′||2 −i||z + iz′||2 + i||z −iz′||2)
 
= (z|z′) .
From what we have seen, suppose y = Ux with x ∈[Ker(U)]⊥. Then
||U ∗y||2 = (U ∗Ux|U ∗Ux) = (Ux|U(U ∗Ux)) = (x|U ∗Ux) = (Ux|Ux) = ||y||2.
In other terms U ∗is isometric on Ran(U), and it remains isometric also on the
closure by continuity. This proves (b).
□
At last, we present a relationship between partial isometries and orthogonal
projectors.
Proposition 3.74 Let U : H →H be a bounded linear operator on the Hilbert
space H.
(a) U is a partial isometry if and only if U ∗U is an orthogonal projector. In such a
case UU ∗is an orthogonal projector as well.
(b) If U is a partial isometry, U ∗U projects onto the initial space of U, and UU ∗
projects onto the ﬁnal space of U.
Proof Suppose U is partially isometric, and let us show U ∗U is an orthogonal pro-
jector. Since the latter is patently self-adjoint, it sufﬁces to show it is idempotent.
Decompose H ∋x = x1 + x2 by x1 ∈Ker(U) and x2 ∈[Ker(U)]⊥. Then
(x|(U ∗U)2x) = (Ux|U ∗UUx) = (Ux2|U(U ∗Ux2)) = (x2|U ∗Ux2) = (Ux2|Ux2)
= (Ux|Ux) .
That is to say, (x|((U ∗U)2 −U ∗U)x) = 0 whichever x ∈H is taken. Choose
x = y ± iz and x = y ± y, and then (y|((U ∗U)2 −U ∗U)z) = 0 for any y, z ∈H.
Therefore U ∗U is idempotent, so an orthogonal projector. Conversely if U ∗U is
an orthogonal projector, let N be the closed subspace onto which it projects. If
U ∗Ux = 0 then Ux ∈Ker(U ∗) = [Ran(U)]⊥. But Ux ∈Ran(U), hence Ux = 0.
Therefore U ∗Ux = 0 if and only if x ∈Ker(U), so N⊥= Ker(U ∗U) = Ker(U)
and N = [Ker(U)]⊥. If additionally x ∈[Ker(U)]⊥= N, then U ∗Ux = x and
||Ux||2 = (U ∗Ux|x) = ||x||2, proving U is a partial isometry. Throughout we also
proved U ∗U projects onto the initial space N = [Ker(U)]⊥. The remaining part
follows easily from Proposition 3.73(b). In fact, if U is a partial isometry, U ∗is
partially isometric and so UU ∗= (U ∗)∗U ∗is an orthogonal projector. From the
previous part it projects onto the closed subspace [Ker(U ∗)]⊥= Ran(U).

3.5 Polar Decomposition

3.5
Polar Decomposition
This section is rather technical and contains useful notions in the theory of bounded
operators on a Hilbert space. The central result is the so-called polar decomposition
theorem for bounded operators, that generalises the polar form of a complex number
whereby z = |z|ei arg z splits as product of the modulus times an exponential with
purely imaginary logarithm. In the analogy z corresponds to a bounded operator, |z|
plays the role of a certain positive operator called modulus, and ei arg z is represented
by a unitary operator when restricted to a subspace. The modulus of an operator is
useful to generalise the “absolute convergence” of numerical series, and is built using
operators and bases. We shall use these series to deﬁne Hilbert–Schmidt operators
and operators of trace class, some of which represent states in QM. Part of the
ensuing proofs are taken from [Mar82, KaAk82].
3.5.1
Square Roots of Bounded Positive Operators
Deﬁnition 3.75 Given a Hilbert space H and A ∈B(H), one says that B ∈B(H)
is a square root of A if B2 = A. If additionally B ≥0, we call B a positive square
root.
We will show in a moment that any bounded positive operator has one, and one only,
positive square root. For this we need the preliminary result below, about sequences
and series of orthogonal projectors in the strong topology, which is on its own a
useful fact in spectral theory.
Proposition 3.76 Let H be a Hilbert space and {An}n∈N ⊂B(H) a non-decreasing
(or non-increasing) sequence of self-adjoint operators. If {An} is bounded from above
(resp. below) by K ∈B(H), there exists a self-adjoint operator A ∈B(H) such that
A ≤K (A ≥K) and:
A = s-
lim
n→+∞An .
(3.57)
Proof We prove it in the non-decreasing case, for the other case falls back to this
situation if one considers K −An.
Set Bn := An + ||A0||I. Then we can prove the following facts.
(i) The Bn form a non-decreasing sequence of positive operators. If ||x|| = 1,
in fact, (x|Anx) + ||A0|| ≥(x|A0x) + ||A0||, but −||A0|| ≤(x|A0x) ≤||A0|| by
Proposition 3.60(a). Therefore (x|Anx) + ||A0|| ≥0 for any unit vector x. That is
to say (y|Any) + ||A0||(y|y) ≥0 for any y ∈H, i.e. Bn = An + ||A0||I ≥0.
(ii) Bn ≤K + ||A0||I =: K1, and K1 is positive (K cannot be).
(iii) (x|K1x) ≥(x|Bnx) −(x|Bmx) ≥0 for any x ∈H if n ≥m. In fact,
(x|K1x) ≥(x|Bnx), and also −(x|Bmx) ≤0 and (x|Bnx) −(x|Bmx) ≥0.
Since any positive operator T deﬁnes a semi-inner product that satisﬁes Schwarz’s
inequality:

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
|(x|T y)|2 ≤(x|T x)(y|T y) ,
(3.58)
we have, if n ≥m:
|(x|(Bn −Bm)y)|2 ≤(x|(Bn −Bm)x)(y|(Bn −Bm)y) ≤(x|K1x)(y|K1y)
≤||K1||2||x||2||y||2 .
Hence
|(x|(Bn −Bm)y)|2 ≤||K1||2||x||2||y||2 .
If we set x = (Bn −Bm)y and take the supremum over unit vectors y ∈H, we ﬁnd:
||Bn −Bm|| ≤||K1|| .
(3.59)
From (3.58), putting y = (Bn −Bm)x and T = Bn −Bm, we obtain
||(Bn −Bm)x||4 = ((Bn −Bm)x|(Bn −Bm)x)2 ≤(x|(Bn −Bm)x)((Bn −Bm)x|(Bn −Bm)2x)
for x ∈H, n ≥m. By (3.59), the last term is bounded by
(x|(Bn −Bm)x)||Bn −Bm||3||x||2 ≤||K1||3||x||2[(x|Bnx) −(x|Bmx)] ,
and so
||(Bn −Bm)x||4 ≤||K1||3||x||2[(x|Bnx) −(x|Bmx)] .
The non-decreasing, bounded sequence of positive numbers (x|Bkx) has to converge,
so it is Cauchy. Therefore also the Bkx must form a Cauchy sequence, and as k →
+∞the limit exists. Deﬁne
B : H ∋x →
lim
n→+∞Bnx .
By construction B is linear, and it satisﬁes
0 ≤(Bx|x) = (x|Bx) ≤(x|K1x)
since 0 ≤(Bkx|x) = (x|Bkx) ≤(x|K1x) for any k ∈N.
Now, K1 is bounded and self-adjoint (it is positive), so Proposition 3.60(a) forces
B to be bounded, since:
sup{|(x|Bx)| | x ∈H , ||x|| = 1} ≤sup{|(x|K1x)| | x ∈H , ||x|| = 1} = ||K1|| .
But B is also self-adjoint because of Proposition 3.60(e). Therefore A := B−||A0||I
is a bounded, self-adjoint operator and

n→+∞(Bn −||A0||I)x =

Eventually, A ≤K because for any x ∈H we have (x|Anx) ≤(x|K x) by assump-
tion, and this is still true when taking the limit as n →+∞.

The above result allows us to prove that bounded positive operators admit square
roots.
Theorem 3.77 Let H be a Hilbert space and A ∈B(H) a positive operator. Then
there exists a unique positive square root, indicated by

if AB = B A with B ∈B(H), then

(b) if A is bijective,
√
A is bijective.
Proof We may as well suppose ||A|| ≤1 without any loss of generality, so let us set
A0 := I −A. We shall show A0 ≥0 and ||A0|| ≤1.
First of all A0 ≥0 because (x|A0x) = (x|x)−(x|Ax) ≥||x||2−||A||||x||2, where
we have used A = A∗, so (Proposition 3.60(a)) ||A|| = sup{|(z|Az)||||z|| = 1}, and
|(z|Az)| = (z|Az) by positivity. Since (x, y) →(x|A0y) is a semi-inner product,
from A0 ≥0, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality:
|(x|A0y)|2 ≤(x|A0x)(y|A0y) ≤||x||2||y||2
holds, having used the positivity of A = I −A0 and A0 in the ﬁnal step. Since
A = A∗, using y = A0x in the inequality gives
|(A0x|A0x)|2 ≤||x||2||A0x||2 ,
hence ||A0x|| ≤||x||, and so:
||A0|| ≤1 .

From (3.60), using the norm’s properties,
||Bn|| ≤1 for any n ∈N .
(3.62)
By induction, the operators Bn are polynomials in A0 with non-negative coefﬁcients.
Recall, here and in the sequel, that all operators Bk commute with one another and
with A0, by construction. Equation (3.61) implies

i.e.
Bn+1 −Bn = 1

This identity implies, via induction, that Bn+1 −Bn are polynomials in A0 with non-
negative coefﬁcients: every Bn + Bn−1 is a sum of polynomials with non-negative
coefﬁcients, and is itself a polynomial with non-negative coefﬁcients; moreover, the
product of two such is still of the same kind.
Since A0 ≥0, any polynomial in A0 with non-negative coefﬁcients is a positive
operator: the polynomial is a sum of terms a2n A2n

Weconcludetheboundedoperators Bn and Bn+1−Bn arepositive.Sothesequence
of positive, bounded (and self-adjoint) operators Bn is non-decreasing. The sequence
is also bounded from above by I. In fact, B∗
n = Bn ≥0 implies, due to Proposition
3.60(a), that (x|Bnx) = |(x|Bnx)| ≤||Bn||||x||2. From (3.62) follows Bn ≤I. So,
we may apply Proposition 3.76 to obtain a positive bounded operator B0 ≤I such
that
B0 = s-

n→+∞Bn .
By deﬁnition of strong topology, and because the continuous operators Bk commute,
B0Bmx = ( lim

B0x = 1
2(A0x + B2
0 x) ,
for any x ∈H, i.e.
2B0 = A0 + B2
0 .
To conclude, let us write the above identity in terms of B := I −B0:
B2 = I −A0 ,
i.e.
B2 = A .
Therefore B is a square root of A. Note that B ≥0 because B0 ≤I and B = I −B0,
so B is a positive root of A. Moreover, if C is bounded and commutes with A, it
commutes with A0 and hence with any Bn. Therefore C commutes also with B0 and
B = I −B0.
Let us now show the uniqueness of a positive square root V of A. The above
positive root B commutes with all operators that commute with A. Since
AV = V 3 = V A ,
V and A commute, forcing B to commute with V . Fix an arbitrary x ∈H and set
y := Bx −V x. Then:
||Bx−V x||2 = ([B−V ]x|[B−V ]x) = ([B−V ]x|y) = (x|[B∗−V ∗]y) = (x|[B−V ]y) (3.63)
We will show that By = 0 and V y = 0 independently. This will end the proof,
because then ||Bx −V x|| = 0 will imply B = V .
Now,
(y|By)+(y|V y) = (y|[B + V ][B −V ]x) = (y|[B2 −V 2]x) = (y|[A −A]x) = 0.
Since (y|V y) ≥0 and (y|By) ≥0,
(y|V y) = (y|By) = 0 .
This means V y = By = 0, for if W is a positive root of V , from
||W y||2 = (W y|W y) = (y|W 2y) = (y|V y) = 0
it follows that W y = 0 and a fortiori V y = W(W y) = 0. Analogously, By = 0.
There remains to prove

3.5.2
Polar Decomposition of Bounded Operators
To conclude the section we will show that any bounded operator A in a Hilbert space
admits a decomposition A = U P as a product of a uniquely-determined positive
operator P with an isometric operator U, deﬁned and unique on the image of P. The
splitting is called polar decomposition and has a host of applications in mathematical
physics. A preparatory deﬁnition is needed ﬁrst.
Deﬁnition 3.80 Let H be a Hilbert space and A ∈B(H). The bounded, positive and
hence self-adjoint operator
|A| :=
√
A∗A
(3.64)
is called modulus of A.
Remark 3.81 For any x ∈H: || |A| x||2 = (x| |A|2x) = (x|A∗Ax) = ||Ax||2, so:
|| |A| x|| = ||Ax|| ,
(3.65)
whence:
Ker(|A|) = Ker(A)
(3.66)
and so |A| is injective if and only if A is. Another useful property is
Ran(|A|) = (Ker(A))⊥,
(3.67)
consequence of
Ran(|A|) = ((Ran(|A|))⊥)⊥= (Ker(|A|∗))⊥= (Ker(|A|))⊥= (Ker(A))⊥.
■

3.5 Polar Decomposition
159
Now to the polar decomposition theorem. We present the version for bounded oper-
ators. Theorem 10.39 will give us a more general statement about a special class of
unbounded operators.
Theorem 3.82 (Polar decomposition of bounded operators) Let H be a Hilbert
space and A ∈B(H).
(a) There exist unique operators P,U ∈B(H) such that:
(1) the decomposition
A = U P
(3.68)
holds,
(2) P is positive,
(3) U is isometric on Ran(P),
(4) U is null on Ker(P).
(b) P = |A|, so Ker(U) = Ker(A) = Ker(P) = [Ran(P)]⊥.
(c) If A is bijective, U coincides with the unitary operator A|A|−1.
Proof (a)Westartwiththeuniqueness.Supposewehave(3.68), A = UP with P ≥0
(beside bounded) andU bounded. Then A∗= PU ∗, since P is self-adjoint as positive
(Theorem 3.77(c)), and hence
A∗A = PU ∗U P .
(3.69)
That U is isometric on Ran(P) is expressed as (U Px|U Py) = (Px|Py) for
any x, y ∈H, or (x|[PU ∗U P −P2]y) = 0 for any x, y ∈H. Therefore
PU ∗U P = P2. Substituting in (3.69) we have P2 = A∗A. As P is positive and
extracting the only positive root (Theorem 3.77) of both sides we get P = |A|.
So if a decomposition as claimed exists, necessarily P = |A|. Let us prove U is
unique as well. From H = Ker(P)⊕(Ker(P))⊥, Proposition 3.38(d) and Theorem
3.13(e) imply (Ker(P))⊥= Ran(P∗) = Ran(P) because P is self-adjoint. Hence
H = Ker(P) ⊕Ran(P). To deﬁne an operator on H it sufﬁces to have it on both
summands: U = 0 on Ker(P), while U Px = Ax for any x ∈H determines U on
Ran(P) uniquely. By assumption, on the other hand, U is bounded, and it remains
bounded if restricted to Ran(P). A bounded operator over a dense domain can be
extended to a unique bounded operator on the closed domain (cf. Proposition 2.47).
Therefore U is completely determined on Ran(P), hence on H. This concludes the
proof of the uniqueness, so let us deal with the existence.
We must show that U P = A, P = |A|, or better: U : |A|x →Ax, for any x ∈H,
actually deﬁnes an operator, say U0, on Ran(|A|). To make it well deﬁned, it is
necessary and sufﬁcient that |A|x = |A|y ⇒Ax = Ay, otherwise it would not be a
function. By (3.65), if |A|x = |A|y, then Ax = Ay, so U0 : Ran(|A|) ∋|A|x →Ax
is well deﬁned (not multi-valued). That U0 is linear is obvious by construction, as
is the fact that it is an isometry, for U0 preserves norms by (3.65) (cf. Exercise
3.8). Being an isometry on Ran(|A|) implies, by continuity, that we can extend it
uniquely to an isometry, still called U0, on the closure of Ran(|A|). Now deﬁne

160
3
Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
U : H →H by setting U ↾Ker(|A|):= 0 and U ↾Ran(|A|):= U0, relative to the splitting
H = Ker(|A|) ⊕Ran(|A|). It is immediate to see that U ∈B(H) and U satisﬁes
(3.68). Furthermore, by construction Ker(U) ⊃Ker(|A|). We claim the latter two
are equal. Any u with Uu = 0 splits into u0 + x, with u0 ∈Ker(|A|) annihilated
by U, and x ∈Ran(|A|) such that U0x = 0. Since on Ran(|A|) U0 is isometric,
then x = 0 and so u = u0 ∈Ker(|A|). Therefore Ker(U) ⊂Ker(|A|), so overall
Ker(U) = Ker(|A|) = Ker(A) by (3.66).
(b) was proved within part (a).
(c) If A is injective, using (b) we see Ker(A) = Ker(U) is trivial and so U is
injective. Directly from A = U P, though, we have Ran(U) ⊃Ran(A), so if A is
onto also U is. Hence, if A is bijective then U must be as well. If so, U is a surjective
isometry on Ran(P) = (Ker(P))⊥= {0}⊥= H by (b), hence unitary. At last, from
A = U|A| follows that |A| is bijective because A and U are, whence we can write
U = A|A|−1.
□
Remarks 3.83 (1) The operator U showing up in (3.69) is a partial isometry (Deﬁ-
nition 3.72) with initial space
[Ker(U)]⊥= Ran(|A|) = [Ker(A)]⊥= Ran(A∗) .
Bearing in mind Proposition 3.73(a) we see easily that the ﬁnal space of U is
Ran(U) = Ran(A) .
(2) Theorem 10.39 gives a polar decomposition under much weaker assumptions on
A. We will also prove that the partial isometry U has the same initial and ﬁnal spaces
above, and is unitary precisely when A is injective and, simultaneously, Ran(A) is
dense in H.
■
Deﬁnition 3.84 Let H be a Hilbert space and A ∈B(H). The splitting
A = U P ,
(3.70)
with P ∈B(H) positive, U ∈B(H) isometric on Ran(P) and null on Ker(P), is
called polar decomposition of the operator A.
A corollary of the polar decomposition, useful in several applications, is this.
Corollary 3.85 (to Theorem 3.82) Under the assumptions of Theorem 3.82, if
U|A| = A is the polar decomposition of A, then:
|A∗| = U|A|U ∗.
(3.71)
Proof From A = U|A| follows A∗= |A|U ∗= U ∗U|A|U ∗, where we used
U ∗U|A| = |A|, since U is isometric on Ran(|A|). Thus the self-adjoint operator
AA∗satisﬁes

3.5 Polar Decomposition
161
AA∗= U|A|U ∗U|A|U ∗.
As U|A|U ∗is clearly positive, by uniqueness of the root we have
|A∗| =

(A∗)∗A∗=
√
AA∗= U|A|U ∗,
proving the claim.
□
We cite, in the form of the next theorem, yet another consequence of the polar
decomposition theorem valid when A ∈B(H) is normal, i.e. commuting with A∗.
Theorem 3.86 (Polar decomposition of normal operators) Let A ∈B(H) be a
normal operator on the Hilbert space H, and W0 : Ker(A) →Ker(A) a given
unitary operator.
There exists a unique pair W, P ∈B(H) such that P ≥0, W is unitary and:
A = W P
with W↾Ker(A)= W0 .
Moreover, P = |A|, W ↾Ker(A)⊥does not depend on W0, and W commutes with A,
A∗and |A|.
Proof Under the assumptions made, A = W P implies A∗A = PW ∗W P = P2, so
P = |P|. Then consider the polar decomposition A = U|A|. As we know (Remark
3.83(1)) U is partially isometric, with initial space Ker(A)⊥and ﬁnal space Ran(A).
We have H = Ker(A)⊕Ker(A)⊥= Ker(A)⊕Ran(A∗), and since A is normal, by
(iii) in Proposition 3.60(b) we can write H = Ker(A)⊕Ran(A). SoU is unitary from
Ran(A) to Ran(A), and is null from Ker(A) to itself. Notice Ker(|A|) = Ker(A),
as seen earlier, so Ran(|A|) = Ran(A). Now if there exists W unitary with A =
W|A|, it must be isometric on Ker(A)⊥= Ran(A), so it must coincide with U there
by the polar decomposition theorem. Therefore the restriction of W to Ran(A) gives
a unitary operator from Ran(A) to Ran(A). The condition W ↾Ker(A)= W0 ﬁxes
W completely on the whole Hilbert space as a unitary operator, ending the proof
of uniqueness. As far as existence is concerned, it is enough to verify that W :=
W0 ⊕U, corresponding to H = Ker(A) ⊕Ran(A), is an operator that commutes
with A, A∗, and that |A| fulﬁls A = W|A|. The latter request is true by the polar
decomposition theorem, for Ker(|A|) = Ker(A). Since A∗(Ker(A∗)) ⊂Ker(A∗),
we have A(Ker(A∗)⊥) ⊂Ker(A∗)⊥, i.e. A(Ran(A)) ⊂Ran(A). With respect to
the usual orthogonal splitting of the Hilbert space, A = 0 ⊕A↾Ran(A). Since we have
W = W0 ⊕U ↾Ran(U) and A = 0 ⊕A↾Ran(A), the condition AW = W A holds if
AU = U A. So let us prove the latter. By polar decomposition, A = U|A|. Normality
(AA∗= A∗A) can be rephrased as U|A|2U ∗= |A|U ∗U|A| = |A|2, since U is
isometric on Ran(|A|). Therefore U ∗U|A|2U ∗= U ∗|A|2 i.e. |A|2U ∗= U ∗|A|2.
Taking adjoints gives U|A|2 = |A|2U. Theorem 3.77(a) says the root of an operator
commutes with anything that commutes with the given operator, so U|A| = |A|U.

162

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
Still by polar decomposition we infer U A = AU, so W A = AW, as required.
Eventually, taking adjoints: A∗W ∗= W ∗A∗, and using W on both sides produces
W A∗= A∗W. Consequently W commutes with A∗A = |A|2, and hence also with
its square root |A|.

3.6
Introduction to von Neumann Algebras
Prominent examples of C∗-algebras, which are absolutely fundamental for the appli-
cations in Quantum Field Theory (but not only), are von Neumann algebras. Before
we introduce them, let us ﬁrst deﬁne the commutant of an operator algebra, and state
an important theorem.
3.6.1
The Notion of Commutant
If M ⊂B(H) is a subset of bounded operators on a complex Hilbert space, the
commutant of M is:
M′ := {T ∈B(H) | T A −AT = 0 for any A ∈M} .
Remark 3.87 If M is closed under the Hermitian conjugation (i.e. A∗∈M if A ∈
M) the commutant M′ is surely a ∗-algebra with unit. In general, M2 ⊂M1 ⇒
M′
1 ⊂M′
2, and M ⊂(M′)′, which imply M′ = ((M′)′)′. Hence we cannot reach
beyond the second commutant by iterating the construction.
■
The continuity of the product of operators says that the commutant M′ is closed in
the uniform topology, so if M is closed under Hermitian conjugation, its commutant
M′ is a C∗-subalgebra in B(H).
M′ has other pivotal topological properties in this general setup. It is easy to prove
M′ is both strongly and weakly closed. This holds, despite the product of operators
is not continuous, because separate continuity in each variable is sufﬁcient.
In the sequel we shall adopt the standard convention used for von Neumann
algebras and write M′′ instead of (M′)′ etc.. The next crucial result is due to von
Neumann [BrRo02].
Theorem 3.88 (Double commutant theorem) If H is a complex Hilbert space and
A a unital ∗-subalgebra of B(H), the following facts are equivalent.
(a) A = A′′.
(b) A is weakly closed.
(c) A is strongly closed.
Furthermore, if B is a unital ∗-subalgebra of B(H), then

3.6 Introduction to von Neumann Algebras
163
B′′ = B
w = B
s ,
where the bars denote the closure in the weak (·w) or strong (·s) topology.
Proof (a) implies (b) because the commutant S′ of a set S ⊂B(H) is closed in
the weak topology, as we can also show directly: if An ∈S′ for any n ∈N and
An →A ∈B(H) weakly, then A∗
n →A∗weakly (this is immediate), so for B ∈S:
0 = (ψ|(An B −B An)φ) = (Bφ|A∗nψ) −(B∗ψ|Anφ) →(Aψ|Bφ) −(B∗ψ|Aφ)
= (ψ|(AB −B A)φ) ,
hence (ψ|(AB −B A)φ) = 0. Being ψ, φ arbitrary in H, A commutes with B, and
A ∈S′ because B ∈S is generic.
(b) implies (c) because strong convergence implies weak convergence, and therefore
a limit point in the strong topology remains a limit point in the weak one.
To ﬁnish the proof of the ﬁrst part we have to show that (c) implies (a). Since
S ⊂S′′ for any set, so that A ⊂A′′, we only need to prove that A′′ ⊂A
s since
A
s = A by (c).
Lemma 3.89 If A is a unital ∗-subalgebra of B(H), then A′′ ⊂A
s.
Proof of Lemma 3.89. For ψ ∈H deﬁne the closed subspace: Hψ := {Aψ | A ∈A},
and call P the orthogonal projector onto Hψ. By construction, if φ ∈Hψ then
Bφ ∈Hψ for any B ∈A and so P Bφ = Bφ. That is to say P B P = B P for B ∈A.
Taking adjoints gives P B∗= B∗P, since P = P∗by deﬁnition of orthogonal
projector. Since B∗= A for some A ∈A, and since B varies in the whole A as
A ∈A, we conclude P ∈A′. Therefore for any X ∈A′′ we have P X = X P. But
I ∈A, so ψ ∈Hψ and Xψ ∈Hψ (since P Xψ = X Pψ = Xψ). By deﬁnition of
Hψ, Xψ ∈Hψ implies that for any ε > 0 there exists A ∈A with ||Aψ −Xψ|| <
ε. Consider then a ﬁnite collection of vectors ψ1, ψ2, . . . , ψn and the direct sum
Hn := H ⊕· · · ⊕H (n copies) with inner product ((x1, . . . , xn)|(y1, . . . , yn)) :=
n
k=1(xk|yk) (see Sect.3.4.2 for a precise description of this structure, called the
n-fold Hilbert sum of H). On this Hilbert space, take the algebra An ⊂B(Hn) of
operators of the form A⊕· · ·⊕A : (v1, . . . , vn) →(Av1, . . . , Avn), with νk ∈H for
k = 1, . . . , n, A ∈A. It is immediate that An is a ∗-subalgebra (with unit) in B(Hn).
If X ∈A′′, then X ⊕· · ·⊕X ∈A′′
n. With the same argument as before, for any ε > 0
there exists A ∈A such that ||Aψk −Xψk|| < ε, for k = 1, . . . , n. By deﬁnition of
strong topology, this implies that if X ∈A′′ then X ∈A
s. In other words A′′ ⊂A
s,
as wanted.
□
Let us come to the last statement of Theorem 3.88 and end its proof. First observe
that B
w is a unital ∗-subalgebra of B(H) (this is direct). Then (1) B
w ⊂B′′, since
B′′ = (B′′)′′ and so B′′ is a weakly closed set containing B (by (b) with A = B′′).
On the other hand B ⊂B
w trivially, so that (2) B′′ ⊂B
w′′ = B
w where, in the last
passage, we have used (a) because B

3.6.2
Von Neumann Algebras, Also Known as W∗-Algebras
At this juncture we are ready to deﬁne von Neumann algebras.
Deﬁnition 3.90 (von Neumann algebra a.k.a. W ∗-algebra) If H ̸= {0} is a complex
Hilbert space, a von Neumann algebra over H, also known as W ∗-algebra over H,
is a unital ∗-subalgebra of B(H) that satisﬁes one of the three equivalent properties
(a), (b), (c) in von Neumann’s double commutant Theorem 3.88.
The centre of a von Neumann algebra R is the subset R ∩R′.
A factor is a von Neumann algebra R whose centre is trivial: R ∩R′ = {cI}c∈C.
Remarks 3.91 (1) Von Neumann algebras are also known as W ∗-algebras, even if
the latter were originally introduced to describe a certain abstract category of C∗-
algebras: a W ∗-algebra, ofﬁcially, is a C∗-algebra arising as topological dual of a
Banach space. In 1970 Sakai proved [Tak00] that abstract W ∗-algebras are in one-
to-one correspondence (up to isomorphism) to concrete von Neumann algebras of
operators on Hilbert spaces. For this reason in the rest of the book we shall use the
two terms as synonyms.
(2) A von Neumann algebra A in B(H) is a C∗-algebra with unit, or better, a C∗-
subalgebra of B(H) with unit. This is because if A is closed in the strong operator
topology then it is also closed in the uniform topology.
(3) The commutant M′ is a von Neumann algebra provided M is a ∗-closed subset
of B(H), because (M′)′′ = M′ as we saw above.
(4) A von Neumann algebra R on a Hilbert space H is not just closed in the weak
and strong operator topologies: it is also complete with respect to both. In other
words, if {An}n∈N ⊂R is such that {Anψ}n∈N is Cauchy in H for every ψ ∈H (or
{(φ|Anψ)}n∈N is Cauchy in C for every φ, ψ ∈H), then An →A for some A ∈R
in the strong (or weak, respectively) operator topology. See Exercises 3.34 and 3.35.
(5) If {Rα}α∈A is a family of von Neumann algebras on the Hilbert space H, it is easy
to prove that
!
α∈A
Rα :=

α∈A
Rα
is a von Neumann algebra on H. It is the largest von Neumann algebra contained in
each Rα.

If M ⊂B(H) (with H ̸= {0}) is closed under Hermitian conjugation, M′′ turns
out to be the smallest (set-theoretically) von Neumann algebra containing M as a

165
subset. Indeed, if A is a von Neumann algebra and M ⊂A, then M′ ⊃A′ and
M′′ ⊂A′′ = A. This fact leads to the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 3.92 Let H ̸= {0} be a complex Hilbert space and M ⊂B(H) a closed
set under Hermitian conjugation. The von Neumann algebra M′′ is called the von
Neumann algebra generated by M.
If M is a unital ∗-subalgebra of B(H), the von Neumann algebra M′′ is nothing but
the weak, and strong, closure of M, due to the double commutant theorem.
If {Rα}α∈A is a family of von Neumann algebras on the Hilbert space H, the
following notation is used for the smallest von Neumann algebra containing every
Rα:
#
α∈A
Rα :=
$
α∈A
Rα

′′
.
An elementary fact regarding the simplest case R = B(H) is the following.
Proposition 3.93 Let H ̸= {0} be a complex Hilbert space. Then
(a) B(H)′ = {cI}c∈H, so that B(H)′′ = B(H);
(b) if P ∈B(H)′ is a projector, then either P = I or P = 0;
(c) there are no non-trivial closed subspaces that are invariant under the action of
every element of B(H).
Proof If H has dimension 1 all statements are true, trivially, so let us consider higher
dimensions. (a) Suppose that A ∈B(H)′. If x ∈H, the orthogonal projector onto the
linear space generated by x commutes with A and so Ax = λxx for some λx ∈C.
If y ̸= x, similarly Ay = λyy and A(x + y) = λx+y(x + y). Linearity yields
λxx + λyy = λx+y(x + y)
so that
(λx −λx+y)x = −(λy −λx+y)y .
This immediately implies that both (λx −λx+y) = 0 and (λy −λx+y) = 0 must be
valid whenever x and y are linearly independent (such y exists if dim(H) ≥2). In
particular λx = λy. To conclude the proof, consider a Hilbert basis B for H, so that
z and z′ are linearly independent if z, z′ ∈B and z ̸= z′. What we established above
immediately implies that Az = cz for some ﬁxed c ∈C and every z ∈B. In view of
the continuity of A,
Ax = A

z∈B
(z|x)z =

z∈B
(z|x)Az = c

z∈B
(z|x)z = cx ,
for every x ∈H. We have found that any A ∈B(H)′ has the form A = cI for
some c ∈C. And then obviously B(H)′′ = {cI}′
c∈H = B(H). The ﬁrst part of
(b) immediately follows from PP = P since P = cI for some c ∈C. Let us

166
3
Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
ﬁnally prove (c). If M ⊂H is a closed subspace and A ∈B(H), the inclusion
A(M) ⊂M easily implies P AP = AP, where P is the orthogonal projector onto M.
By assuming A = A∗and taking the adjoint of both sides we also get P AP = P A,
so P A = AP for every self-adjoint A ∈B(H). Decomposing B ∈B(H) as
B = 1
2(B + B∗)+ 1
2i i(B −B∗), and observing that both (B + B∗) and i(B −B∗) are
self-adjoint, then P B = B P holds for every element B ∈B(H). Therefore either
P = 0 or P = I by (b) and, correspondingly, M = {0} or M = H.
□
3.6.3
Further Relevant Operator Topologies
In addition to the uniform, strong and weak topologies, there are at least two further
operator topologies that are relevant when dealing with von Neumann algebras. Given
a Hilbert space H, consider a sequence X := {xn}n∈N ⊂H such that 
n∈N ||xn||2 <
+∞. Deﬁne the seminorm on B(H)
σX(A) :=

n∈N
||Axn||2 ,
for every A ∈B(H).
(3.72)
Similarly, if Y := {yn}n∈N ⊂H is another sequence such that 
n∈N ||yn||2 < +∞,
deﬁne the seminorm on B(H)
σXY(A) :=
					

n∈N
(xn|Ayn)
					 ,
for every A ∈B(H).
(3.73)
It easy to prove that the family of seminorms σX separates points, i.e., σX(A−B) = 0
for all X as above ⇒A = B. The same property is true for the family of seminorms
σXY with X, Y as above.
Deﬁnition 3.94 Given a Hilbert space H consider the families of seminorms deﬁned
by (3.72) and (3.73) for all sequences X := {xn}n∈N ⊂H and Y := {yn}n∈N ⊂H
such that 
n∈N ||xn||2 < +∞and 
n∈N ||yn||2 < +∞.
The topologies on B(H) induced by these two families of seminorms, in accor-
dance with Deﬁnition 2.68, are respectively called σ-strong topology (or ultra-
strong topology) and σ-weak topology (or ultraweak topology).
It is easy to prove that, on B(H),
(a) the uniform topology is ﬁner than the σ-strong topology;
(b) the σ-strong topology is ﬁner than the σ-weak topology;
(c) the σ-strong topology is ﬁner than the strong topology;
(d) the σ-weak topology is ﬁner than the weak topology.

3.6 Introduction to von Neumann Algebras
167
Remark 3.95 (1) A von Neumann algebra in B(H) is closed in the uniform topology
(being a C∗-subalgebra of B(H)), in the weak topology and in the strong topology
(Theorem 3.88). Hence it is also closed for both the σ-weak and the σ-strong topolo-
gies, as a consequence of (c) and (d) above.
(2) A surjective ∗-homomorphism α between two von Neumann algebras is necessar-
ily continuous with respect to the σ-strong and σ-weak topologies [BrRo02, Vol.1,
Theorem 2.4.23].
(3) A special class of ∗-isomorphisms between von Neumann algebras R1 ⊂B(H1)
and R2 ⊂B(H2) are the so-called spatial isomorphisms. These are maps of the
form
α : R1 ∋A →Vα AV ∗
α ∈R2 ,
where Vα : H1 →H2 is some ﬁxed unitary operator (Deﬁnition 3.56(d)). Spatial
isomorphismsalwaysextendtothewholeB(Hi),andtothecommutantsinparticular:
α(R′
1) = α(R′
2) .
■
In the simplest case where R1 = R2 = B(H), it is possible to prove that a ∗-
isomorphism (to be precise, a ∗-automorphism) α : B(H) →B(H) is always spatial.
Theorem 3.96 If H ̸= {0} is a complex Hilbert space and α : B(H) →B(H) a
∗-automorphism, then α is spatial: there exists a unitary operator Uα : H →H such
that
α(A) = Uα AU ∗
α
for every A ∈B(H).
Every unitary operator deﬁnes a ∗-automorphism by the formula above, and a unitary
operatorU1 satisﬁestheformula(inplaceofU)forthegivenα ifandonlyifU1 = χU
for some χ ∈U(1).
Proof If dim(H) = 1, the only ∗-automorphism is the identity and so the thesis
is obvious. Let us pass to dim(H) > 1. The last statement is trivial, in particular
U1 = χU follows from Proposition 3.93 because U1U ∗∈B(H)′, so we shall prove
the ﬁrst claim only. Let N be a Hilbert basis of H and deﬁne the orthogonal projector
Px := (x|·)x for every x ∈N. Every operator P′
x := α(Px) is an orthogonal projector
as well, because α(Px)α(Px) = α(Px Px) = α(Px) and α(Px)∗= α(P∗
x ) = α(Px).
We intend to construct a second Hilbert basis N ′ using α. The projection space of P′
x
is one-dimensional as is the projection space of Px. Indeed, if there existed a pair of
orthonormal vectors z1, z2 in P′
x(H) and we set Qzi := (zi|·)zi for i = 1, 2, we would
have P′
x ̸= Qzi P′
x = Qzi ̸= 0. Then applying α−1 would give Px ̸= α−1(Qzi)Px =
α−1(Qzi) ̸= 0. However, since Px projects onto a one-dimensional subspace, no
such orthogonal projector α−1(Qzi) can exist. Next, observe that ⊕x∈N Px(H) = H
because N is a Hilbert basis, but also ⊕x∈N P′
x(H) = H. In fact, ﬁrst of all P′
x P′
y =
α−1(Px Py) = 0 if x ̸= y, so that P′
x(H) ⊥P′
y(H) when x ̸= y. Furthermore, if
there were z ⊥⊕x∈N P′
x(H) with unit norm, by deﬁning Qz := (z|·)z we would

168
3
Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
have Qz P′
x = 0 for every x ∈N and hence α−1(Qz)α−1(P′
x) = 0. That would
mean α−1(Qz)Px = 0 for every x ∈N and, in turn, α−1(Qz) = 0 so that Qz = 0,
against the hypothesis. If x, y ∈N, the maps Txy := (y|·)x restrict to Hilbert space
isomorphisms between the one-dimensional, mutually orthogonal subspaces Py(H)
and Px(H). If we deﬁne T ′
xy := α ((y|·)x), we have P′
zT ′
xy = α(PzTxy) = 0 for z ̸= x
or α(PzTxy) = T ′
xy if z = x. Since ⊕x∈N P′
x(H) = H and T ′
xy ̸= 0, we conclude that
the range of T ′
xy is one-dimensional and coincides with P′
x(H) itself. Using a similar
argument and T ′∗
xyT ′
xy = α(T ∗
xyTxy) = α(Px) = P′
x, we ﬁnally conclude that the maps
T ′
xy restrict to Hilbert space isomorphisms between the one-dimensional, mutually
orthogonal subspaces P′
y(H) and P′
x(H). To construct the new Hilbert basis N ′, ﬁx a
unit vector y′ ∈P′
y(H) and deﬁne the other unit vectors x′ := T ′
xy y′ for every x ∈N.
Evidently N ′ := {x′}x∈N is a Hilbert basis since each P′
x(H) is one-dimensional and
⊕x∈N P′
x(H) = H, as previously established. One can check the fundamental identity
α(Txy) = UαTxyU ∗
α
for every x, y ∈N,
(3.74)
directly, where Uα : H →H is the unique linear and bounded operator such that
Uαx := x′ for every x ∈N. This operator is unitary because the vectors x form
a Hilbert basis, as do the x′. To conclude the proof, consider A ∈B(H) and the
operators Txx ATyy for x, y ∈N. As Txy := (y|·)x, it is clear that Tyy ATxx = aTxy
where a = (x|Ay), so that (3.74) produces
α(Tyy ATxx) = (x|Ay)UαTyxU ∗
α
because α is linear. Since α preserves the products, the above reads
α(Tyy)α(A)α(Txx) = (x|Ay)UαTyxU ∗
α .
Exploiting (3.74) again,
UαTyyU ∗
αα(A)UαTxxU ∗
α = (x|Ay)UαTyxU ∗
α ,
that is
TyyU ∗
αα(A)UαTxx = (x|Ay)Tyx ,
so that, applying both sides to x and taking the inner product with y,
(y|U ∗
αα(A)Uαx) = (x|Ay) .
Since x, y are generic elements of a Hilbert basis and A, U ∗
αα(A)Uα are bounded,
we have found that
U ∗
αα(A)Uα = A ,
which is equivalent to α(A) = Uα AU ∗
α, concluding the proof.

Hilbert Sum of von Neumann Algebras
There exists a nice interplay between Hilbert sums of Hilbert spaces and direct sums
of C∗-algebras, which specialises to the case of von Neumann algebras.
Proposition 3.97 Consider a family of non-trivial Hilbert spaces {H j} j∈J and a
family of C∗-algebras of operators {A j} j∈J, with A j ⊂B(H j) for every j ∈J.
(a) If ⊕j∈J A j ∈
j∈J A j (Proposition 3.45), the operator
ˆ⊕j∈J A j :

j∈J
H j →

j∈J
H j
given by
ˆ⊕j∈J A j : ⊕jx j →⊕j A jx j
(3.75)
is a well-deﬁned element of B(
j∈J H j). Moreover
|| ˆ⊕j∈J A j|| = || ⊕j∈J A j|| ,
where the norm on the left is the uniform norm of B(
j∈J H j), whereas the one on
the right is the C∗-norm of 
j∈J A j. Therefore the map

j∈J
A j ∋⊕j∈J A j →ˆ⊕j∈J A j ∈B
⎛
⎝

⎠
is an isometric ∗-homomorphism, making the set ˆ
j∈JA j of operators ˆ⊕j∈J A j a
C∗-subalgebra (not necessarily unital) of B(
j∈J H j).
(b) We have


j∈JA′
j .
(c) ˆ
j∈JA j is a von Neumann algebra if each summand A j is a von Neumann
algebra.
Proof (a) First of all we must prove that ˆ⊕j A j ∈B(
j A j). For every ⊕jx j ∈

j H j we have:
|| ˆ⊕j A j(⊕jx j)||2 ≤sup
j
||A j||2 
j
||x j||2 = || ⊕j A j||2 || ⊕j x j||2 .
The result implies at once that ˆ⊕j A j ∈B(
j A j) and || ˆ⊕j A j|| ≤|| ⊕j A j||. To
prove that || ˆ⊕j A j|| = ||⊕j A j|| it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a sequence {⊕j y j,n}n∈N ⊂
j H j
such that || ⊕j y j,n|| = 1 and || ˆ⊕j A j(⊕j y j,n)|| →|| ⊕j A j|| as n →+∞.

170

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
If we look at || ⊕j A j|| := sup j ||A j|| there are two possibilities. Either
(1) || ⊕j A j|| = ||A j0|| for some j0
or
(2) there is a sequence j1, j2, . . . with ||A jn|| →|| ⊕j A j|| as n →+∞.
In case (1), as we know that ||B|| = sup||x||=1 ||Bx||, there must be a sequence
xn ∈H j0 with ||xn|| = 1 and ||A j0xn|| →||A j0|| as n →+∞. In this situation, the
required sequence {⊕j y j,n}n∈N is deﬁned by y j,n = 0 for j ̸= j0 and y j0,n := xn.
In case (2), by exploiting again the general identity ||B|| = sup||x||=1 ||Bx|| on
each operator A jn we conclude that there must exist a sequence of vectors x jn ∈H jn
with ||x jn|| = 1 and | ||A jnx jn|| −||A jn|| | < 1/n. The sequence {⊕j y j,n}n∈N we
need is therefore deﬁned by y j,n = 0 for j ̸= jn and y jn,n := x jn.
The fact that the map ⊕j A j →ˆ⊕j A j is linear, preserves the product and unit
elements is straightforward. Regarding Hermitian conjugation, observe that

Since ⊕jx j, ⊕j y j ∈
j H j are arbitrary, we have ˆ⊕j A j = ( ˆ⊕j A∗
j)∗and hence
( ˆ⊕j A j)∗= ˆ⊕j A∗
j. We have obtained that ⊕j∈J A j →ˆ⊕j∈J A j is an isometric ∗-
homomorphism from the C∗-algebra 
j A j into the C∗-algebra B(
j H j), so the
image ˆ
j∈JA j is a C∗-subalgebra of B(
j H j).
(b) Establishing that


is rather elementary, so let us prove the opposite inclusion. First of all notice that

j A j contains elements ⊕jδi j I j, where i ∈J and I j : H j →H j is the identity
operator. It is easy to prove that Pi := ˆ⊕jδi j I j is the orthogonal projector onto Hi,
viewed as a closed subspace of 
j H j. If B ∈

ˆ
j∈JA j
′
then Pi B = B Pi for all
i ∈J in particular. Obviously, if Ψ ∈
i∈J ψ, we have Ψ = ⊕iψi with ψi = PiΨ .
Therefore Ψ = 
i∈I PiΨ is a ﬁnite or countable sum, for at most countably many
vectors ψik, k ∈N, do not vanish. Consequently, Pi B = B Pi and Pi Pi = Pi imply
B(⊕iψi) = B

k∈N
PikΨ =

k∈N
Pik B PikΨ = ⊕i(Pi B Pi)ψi .
Set Bi := Pi B Pi ∈B(Hi). Then ⊕i Bi ∈
i B(Hi) is well deﬁned because
supi ||Bi|| = supi ||Pi B|| ≤supi ||Pi|| ||B|| ≤||B|| < +∞. By construction
B(⊕iψi) = ⊕i Biψi = ˆ⊕i Bi(⊕iψi) .

Therefore imposing (B A −AB)Ψ = 0 for every A = ˆ⊕i Ai ∈ˆ
iAi and every
Ψ ∈
i ψi implies (Bi Ai −Ai Bi)ψi = 0 for every i ∈J and ψi ∈Hi. In other

3.7
The Fourier–Plancherel Transform
In the last section of the chapter we introduce, rather concisely, the basics on Fourier
and Fourier–Plancherel transforms, without any mention to Schwartz distributions
[Rud91, ReSi80, Vla02].
Notation 3.100 From now on we will use the notations of Example 2.91, origi-
nally introduced for differential operators: in particular xk ∈R will denote the kth
component of x ∈Rn, dx the ordinary Lebesgue measure on Rn, and
Mα(x) := xα1
1 · · · xαn
n
for any multi-index α = (α1, . . . , αn) .
By D(Rn) we shall denote the space of smooth, complex-valued functions with
compact support (in the literature this is also called C∞
c (Rn) or C∞
0 (Rn)), while
S (Rn) willindicatetheSchwartzspace onRn (cf.Example2.91).Inthesenotations
S (Rn) is the C-vector space of complex-valued maps in C∞(Rn) with this property:

172
3
Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
for any f ∈S (Rn) and any multi-indices α, β, there exists K < +∞(depending
on f , α, β) such that
|Mα(x)∂β
x f (x)| ≤K,
for any x ∈Rn .
(3.76)
The norms || ||1, || ||2 and || ||∞will denote, throughout the section, the norms
of L1(Rn, dx), L2(Rn, dx), L∞(Rn, dx) and the corresponding seminorms of
L 1(Rn, dx), L 2(Rn, dx), L ∞(Rn, dx) (see Examples 2.29(6) and (8)).
■
Below we recall a number of known properties.
(1) The spaces D(Rn) and S (Rn) are invariant under Mα(x) (seen as multiplica-
tive operator) and ∂α
x . Put otherwise, functions stay in their respective spaces when
acted upon by Mα(x) and ∂α
x .
(2) Clearly D(Rn) ⊂L p(R, dx) as a subspace, for any 1 ≤p ≤∞, since
compact sets in Rn have ﬁnite Lebesgue measure and any f ∈D(Rn) is continuous,
hence bounded on compact sets.
(3) For any 1 ≤p ≤∞we have S (Rn) ⊂L p(R, dx) as a subspace. In fact, if
C ⊂Rn is a compact set containing the origin, f ∈S (Rn) is bounded on C because
continuous, while outside C we have | f (x)| ≤Cm|x|−m for any n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . .
as long as we choose Cn ≥0 big enough. In summary, | f | is bounded on Rn, so it
belongs to L ∞. But it is also bounded by some map in L p, for any p ∈[1, +∞):
the bounding function is constant on C, and equals Cm/|x|m, m > n/p, outside C.
(4) Beside the obvious inclusion D(Rn) ⊂S (Rn), recall a notorious fact (inde-
pendent of this section) that we will use shortly [KiGv82]:
Proposition 3.101 The spaces D(Rn) and S (Rn) are dense in L p(R, dx), for any
1 ≤p < ∞.
(5) The next important lemma, whose proof can be found in [Bre10, Corollary
IV.24], is independent of this section’s results.
Lemma 3.102 Suppose f ∈L 1(Rn, dx) satisﬁes

Rn f (x)g(x) dx = 0 for any g ∈D(Rn) .
Then f (x) = 0 almost everywhere for the Lebesgue measure dx on Rn.
Let us introduce the ﬁrst elementary deﬁnitions concerning the Fourier transform.
Deﬁnition 3.103 The linear maps L 1(Rn, dx) →L ∞(Rn, dx) given by
(F f )(k) :=

Rn
e−ik·x
(2π)n/2 f (x) dx ,
f ∈L 1(Rn, dx), k ∈Rn ,

(F−g)(x) :=

Rn
eik·x
(2π)n/2 g(k) dk ,
g ∈L 1(Rn, dk), x ∈Rn
(3.78)
are respectively called Fourier transform and inverse Fourier transform.

Remarks 3.104 (1) Above, dk always denotes the Lebesgue measure on Rn. We have
used a different name for the variable on Rn (k, not x) in the inverse Fourier formula,
only to respect the traditional notation, and to simplify subsequent calculations.
(2) By the integral’s properties it is obvious that
|(F f )(k)| ≤
				

Rn e−ik·x f (x)
dx
(2π)n/2
				 ≤

Rn |e−ik·x| | f (x)|
dxn
(2π)n/2 =

Rn | f (x)|
dx
(2π)n/2
=
|| f ||1
(2π)n/2 ,
and similarly |(F−g)(x)| ≤||g||1/(2πn/2) for any x, k ∈Rn. Therefore it makes
sense to deﬁne the Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms as operators with values
in L ∞(Rn, dx).
■
In the sequel we will discuss features of the Fourier transform that most immediately
relate to the Fourier–Plancherel transform. We shall inevitably overlook many results,
like the continuity in the seminorm topology in the Schwartz space, for which we
refer to any text on functional analysis or distributions [Rud91, ReSi80, Vla02] (see
also Sect.2.3.4).
Proposition 3.105 The Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms enjoy the following
properties.
(a) They are continuous in the natural norms of domain and codomain:
||F f ||∞≤
|| f ||1
(2π)n/2
and
||F−g||∞≤
||g||1
(2π)n/2 .
(b) The Schwartz space is invariant under F and F−: F(S (Rn)) ⊂S (Rn) and
F−(S (Rn)) ⊂S (Rn).
(c) When restricted to the invariant space S (Rn) they are one the inverse of the
other: if f ∈S (Rn), then
g(k) =

Rn
e−ik·x
(2π)n/2 f (x) dx
if and only if
f (x) =

Rn
eik·x
(2π)n/2 g(k) dk.
(d) When restricted to the invariant space S (Rn) they are isometric for the semi-
inner product of L 2(Rn, dxn): if f1, f2, g1, g2 ∈S (Rn), then

Rn (F f1)(k)(F f2)(k)dk =

Rn f1(x) f2(x)dx

174

and

Rn (F−g1)(x)(F−g2)(x)dx =

Rn g1(k)g2(k)dk .
(e) They determine bounded maps from L1(Rn, dx) to C0(Rn) (continuous maps
that vanish at inﬁnity, cf. Example 2.29(4)), and so the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma
holds: for any f ∈L1(Rn, dx)
(F f ) (k) →0 as |k| →+∞
and analogously for F−.
(f) They are injective if deﬁned on L1(Rn, dx).
Remark 3.106 Concerning statement (f), more can be proved [Rud91], namely: if
f ∈L1(Rn, dx) is such that F f ∈L1(Rn, dk), then F−(F f ) = f . The same
holds if we swap F and F−.
■
Proof of Proposition 3.105. Part (a) was proved in Remark 3.104(2). As for (b), let
us prove the claim about F, the one about F−being similar. Set
g(k) :=

Rn
e−ik·x
(2π)n/2 f (x) dx.
The right-hand side can be differentiated in k by passing the operator ∂α
k inside the
integral. In fact,
		∂α
k e−ik·x f (x)
		 =
		i|α|Mα(x)e−ik·x f (x)
		 ≤|Mα(x) f (x)| .
The function x →|Mα(x) f (x)| is in L 1 because f ∈S (Rn). Since the absolute
valueofthederivativeoftheintegrandisuniformlyboundedbyanintegrable,positive
map, known theorems on exchanging derivatives and integrals allow to say:
∂α
k g(k) = (−i)|α|

Rn
e−ik·x
(2π)n/2 Mα(x) f (x) dx .
(3.79)
But f vanishes faster than any negative power of |x|, as |x| →+∞, so:
Mβ(k)g(k) =

Rn i|β|∂β
x
 e−ik·x
(2π)n/2

f (x) dx
and, integrating by parts,
Mβ(k)g(k) = (−i)|β|

Rn
e−ik·x
(2π)n/2 ∂β
x f (x) dx .
(3.80)
Writing ∂α
k g instead of g in (3.80), and by (a), we have:

3.7 The Fourier–Plancherel Transform
175
|Mβ(k)∂α
k g(k)| ≤
				∂β (Mα f )
				
1 ,
for any k ∈Rn. The right-hand-side term is ﬁnite, since f ∈S (Rn); and because α
and β are arbitrary, we conclude g ∈S (Rn).
(c) Identities (3.79) and (3.80) read:
∂α F = (−i)|α| F Mα ,
(3.81)
Mβ F = (−i)|β| F∂β ,
(3.82)
where F is the restriction of the Fourier transform to S (Rn). Observing that
Fh = F−h
for any h ∈S (Rn), it is easy to obtain
∂α F−= i|α| F−Mα ,
(3.83)
Mβ F−= i|β| F−∂β .
(3.84)
Then (3.81), (3.82), (3.83) and (3.84) imply in particular that:
FF−Mα = MαFF−,
(3.85)
F−F Mα = MαF−F ,
(3.86)
where Mα is thought of as multiplicative operator (Mα f )(x) := Mα(x) f (x), and
FF−∂α = ∂αFF−,
(3.87)
F−F ∂α = ∂αF−F .
(3.88)
By virtue of those commuting relations, we claim J := FF−and J−:= F−F are
the identity of S (Rn). To begin with, we show, given x0 ∈Rn and f ∈S (Rn), that
the value (J f )(x0) depends only on f (x0). If f ∈S (Rn) we can write:
f (x) = f (x0) +
 1
0
d f (x0 + t(x −x0))
dt
dt = f (x0) +
n

i=1
(xi −x0i)gi(x) ,
where the gi (in C∞(Rn), as is easy to see) are:
gi(x) :=
∂
∂xi
 1
0
f (x0 + t(x −x0))dt.
Hence if f1, f2 ∈S (Rn) and f1(x0) = f2(x0):

176
3
Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
f1(x) = f2(x) +
n

i=1
(xi −x0i)hi(x) ,
(3.89)
where, subtracting, the map x →n
i=1(xi −x0i)hi(x) and also the hi belong to
S (Rn). Using J on both sides of (3.89) and recalling J commutes with polynomials
in x by (3.85), we have:
(J f1)(x) = (J f2)(x) +
n

i=1
(xi −x0i)(Jhi)(x) .
Taking x = x0 shows (J f1)(x0) = (J f2)(x0) under the initial assumption f1(x0) =
f2(x0). Hence, as claimed, (J f )(x0) is a map of f (x0) only. This map must be linear,
as J is linear by construction. Consequently (J f )(x0) = j(x0) f (x0) for some map
j : Rn →C. Given that x0 was arbitrary, J acts as multiplication by a function j. The
latter must be C∞. To justify this, choose f ∈S (Rn) equal to 1 on a neighbourhood
I (x0) of x0. If x ∈I (x0), then (J f )(x) = j(x). The left-hand side is C∞on I (x0), so
also the right term is. That being valid around any point in Rn, we have j ∈C∞(Rn).
Equation (3.87) implies
j(x) ∂
∂xi f (x) =
∂
∂xi j(x) f (x)
for any f ∈S (Rn), x ∈Rn. Choose as before f equal 1 on an open set, so the
above identity forces all derivatives of j to vanish there. This holds around any point,
and Rn is connected, so the continuous map j is constant on Rn. The constant value
clearly does not depend on the argument of J, and may be computed by evaluating
J on an arbitrary function S (Rn). Computing J on x →e−x2 is a useful exercise,
and reveals the constant value is exactly 1. The argument for J−is similar.
(d) Using (c) the claim is immediate. Let us carry out the proof for F; the one for
F−is the same, essentially. Let f1, f2 ∈S (Rn) and set, i = 1, 2:
gi(k) :=

Rn
e−ik·x
(2π)n/2 fi(x) dx .
With the assumptions made, the theorem of Fubini–Tonelli gives:

Rn g1(k)g2(k)dk =

Rn g1(k)

Rn
e−ik·x
(2π)n/2 f2(x)dxdk
=

Rn×Rn
e−ik·x
(2π)n/2 g1(k) f2(x)dx ⊗dk .
Now we rephrase the last integral and apply Fubini–Tonelli again:

3.7 The Fourier–Plancherel Transform
177

Rn g1(k)g2(k)dk
=

Rn×Rn
eik·x
(2π)n/2 g1(k) f2(x)dx ⊗dk =

Rn f2(x)

Rn
eik·x
(2π)n/2 g1(k)dkdx
=

Rn f1(x) f2(x)dx ,
where part (c) was used. This was what we wanted.
(e) We prove the statement for F, and leave the similar assertion about F−to the
reader. Notice that both transformations are well deﬁned on L1(Rn, dx) since the
integral does not change by altering the maps by sets of zero Lebesgue measure. The
estimate ||F f ||∞≤
|| f ||1
(2π)n/2 guarantees the linear map F : S (Rn) →S (Rn) ⊂
C0(Rn) is continuous when the domain has the L1 norm and the codomain has
|| · ||∞. Now recall S (Rn) is dense in L1 in the given norm, and the codomain
is complete in the second norm. Hence the Fourier transform, initially deﬁned on
S (Rn), can be extended by continuity – in a unique way – to a bounded linear
map L1(Rn, dx) →C0(Rn) that preserves the same norm by Proposition 2.47 (and
coincides with the aforementioned linear transformation on L1(Rn, dx)). If f ∈L1,
F f ∈C0(Rn), then for any ε > 0 there is a compact set Kε ⊂Rn such that
|(F f )(k)| < ε if k /∈Kε. Choose, for any ε > 0, a ball at the origin of radius rε
large enough to contain Kε. Then there exists, for any ε > 0, a real number rε > 0
such that |(F f )(k)| < ε if |k| > rε.
(f) We prove the claim for F, as the one for F−is analogous. Since F is a lin-
ear operator, it sufﬁces to show that if F f is the zero map then f is null almost
everywhere. Therefore assume:

Rn
e−ik·x
(2π)n/2 f (x) dx = 0 ,
for any k ∈Rn.
If g ∈S (Rn), the Fubini–Tonelli theorem gives
0 =

Rn g(k)

Rn

(2π)n/2 f (x) dx dk =

Rn

Rn

(2π)n/2 g(k) dk

f (x) dx .
Since F is bijective on S (Rn), what we have proved is equivalent to:

Rn ψ(x) f (x) dx = 0 for any ψ ∈S (Rn)
(note ψ f ∈L 1(Rn, dx) for any ψ ∈S (Rn), as ψ is bounded). As D(Rn) ⊂
S (Rn), Lemma 3.102 forces f to vanish almost everywhere.
□
We move on to the Fourier–Plancherel transform. As S (Rn) is dense in L 2(Rn),
by considering equivalence classes we can say S (Rn) determines a dense subset,

178

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
still called S (Rn), in the Hilbert space L2(Rn). The operators F and F−can be
seen as deﬁned on that dense subspace of L2(R, dx). Proposition 3.105(d) says in
particular that these operators are bounded with norm 1, since they are isometric.
Then Proposition 2.47 tells us F and F−determine unique bounded linear operators
on L2(Rn, dx). For instance, the operator extending F to L2(Rn, dx) is deﬁned as
%
F f :=
lim
n→+∞F fn ,
for f ∈L2(Rn, dx). Above, { fn}n∈N ⊂S (Rn) is an arbitrary sequence converging
to f in the topology of L2(Rn, dx). By the inner product’s continuity, the extended
operator %
F will preserve the inner product of L2(R2, dx), and as such %
F will be 1-1
on L2(Rn, dx). The following elementary argument explains why %
F is surjective,
too. Beside %
F, we can construct the operator &
F−that extends to L2(Rn, dx) the
inverse Fourier transform. On S (Rn, dx)
FF−= IS (Rn).
Now pass to the L2 extensions, by linearity and continuity, and recall that the unique
linear extension of the identity from S (Rn, dx) to L2(Rn, dx) is the latter’s identity
operator I (constructed in the general way explained above). Then
%
F %
F−= I ,
This condition implies %
F is onto.
Deﬁnition 3.107 The unique operator %
F : L2(Rn, dx) →L2(Rn, dx) that extends
linearly and continuously the Fourier transform on S (Rn) is called Fourier–
Plancherel transform.
Theorem 3.108 (Plancherel) The Fourier–Plancherel transform:
%
F : L2(Rn, dx) →L2(Rn, dx)
is a bijective and isometric linear operator.
Proof The proof was given immediately before Deﬁnition 3.107.

ciates ( f, g) ∈L2(Rn, dx) × L2(Rn, dx) to

Exploiting Theorem 3.108, it is simple to prove that
⟨%
F f, g⟩= ⟨f, %
F g⟩.

3.7 The Fourier–Plancherel Transform
179
This result is the starting point to deﬁne Fourier transforms of distributions.
■
There is still one issue we have to deal with. If f ∈L1(Rn, dx) ∩L2(Rn, dx) (but
f /∈S (Rn)), a priori F f and %
F f may be different, because to deﬁne %
F we did
not extend F from L1(Rn, dx), but rather from the subspace S (Rn). This was the
only possible choice because L1(Rn, dx) ̸⊂L2(Rn, dx).
The next proposition sheds light on the matter, and provides a practical method to
compute the Fourier–Plancherel transform by means of limits of Fourier transforms.
Remark 3.110 Recall that if K ⊂Rn is a ﬁnite-measure set, in particular compact,
(compact sets have ﬁnite Lebesgue measure):
(1) L2(K, dx) ⊂L1(K, dx);
(2) if { fn}n∈N ⊂L2(K, dx) converges in norm || ||2 to f ∈L2(K, dx), it con-
verges in norm || ||1 to f ;
(3) L∞(K, dx) ⊂L p(K, dx), 1 ≤p < ∞;
(4) if { fn}n∈N ⊂L∞(K, dx) converges in norm || ||∞to f ∈L∞(K, dx), it
converges to f in norm || ||p as well.
These four statements are proved as follows: concerning the ﬁrst two, recall the
constant map 1 on a compact (of ﬁnite measure) set is integrable. Since
2| f (x)| ≤| f (x)|2 + 1 ,
the integral of the left is bounded by the integral of the right, so we have statement
(1). As for the second claim, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality

with f (x) −fn(x) replacing g(x) proves (2). To settle the other two, note that by

Proposition 3.111 The Fourier–Plancherel and Fourier transforms satisfy the fol-
lowing properties.
(a) If f ∈L2(Rn, dx) ∩L1(Rn, dx), the Fourier–Plancherel transform reduces to
the Fourier transform F f computed by integral formula (3.77).
(b) If f ∈L2(Rn, dx), the Fourier–Plancherel transform can be computed as the
limit (understood in L2(Rn, dk))

gn(k) :=

Kn
e−ik·x
(2π)n/2 f (x)dx ,
(3.90)
where Kn ⊂Rn are compact, Km+1 ⊃Km, m = 1, 2, . . ., and ∪∞
m=1Km = Rn.
Proof (a) Begin with proving the claim for f ∈L2(Rn, dx) different from 0 on a
zero-measure set outside a compact set K0. Such an f belongs to L1(Rn, dx). Let
then {sn}n∈N ⊂S (Rn) be a sequence converging to f in L2(Rn, dx). If B, B′ are
open balls of ﬁnite radius with B ⊃B′ ⊃B′ ⊃K0, we can construct a function
h ∈D(Rn) equal to 1 on B′ and null outside B. Obviously, letting fn := h · sn, the
sequence { fn} is in D(Rn) and hence in S (Rn). The supports lie in the compact set
K := B. Therefore every fn belongs to L1(Rn, dx) and the sequence { fn} tends to
f in L2(Rn, dx) and L1(Rn, dx).
By deﬁnition, as fn →f in norm || ||2,
||F fn −ˆ
F f ||2 →0
(3.91)
as n →+∞. At the same time, since fn →f in norm || ||1, by Proposition 3.105(a)
we have ||F fn −F f ||∞→0 as n →+∞. But on ﬁnite-measure sets, convergence
for || ||∞implies convergence for || ||2, so
||F fn −F f ||2 →0
(3.92)
and hence %
F f = F f by (3.91) and by uniqueness of the limit.
Suppose now f ∈L2(Rn, dx) ∩L1(Rn, dx), and nothing more. Consider an
exhaustion of Rn by compact sets {Kn}. Deﬁne maps fn := χKn · f , where χE is the
characteristic function of E (χE(x) = 0 if x /∈E and χE(x) = 1 if x ∈E). It is clear
that fn →f pointwise, as n →+∞. Moreover | f (x) −fn(x)|p ≤| f (x)|p, p =
1, 2, . . .. By Lebesgue’s dominated convergence theorem, fn →f as n →+∞,
both for || ||1 and || ||2. On the other hand what we have proved just above tells:
F fn = %
F fn .
Proposition 3.105(a) gives ||F f −F fn||∞→0 and at the same time || %
F f −
F fn||2 →0. These facts hold also when restricting %
F f , F f , F fn to any compact
set K. For maps that are zero outside a compact set uniform convergence implies
L2 convergence, so if x belongs to a compact set, (F f )(x) = ( %
F f )(x) almost
everywhere. But every point x ∈Rn belongs to some compact set, so F f = %
F f
as elements in L2(Rn, dx).
(b) This was proved in the ﬁnal part of (a).
□
Examples 3.112 (1) There is an important property distinguishing D(Rn) from
S (Rn): only the former is not invariant under the Fourier transform (and inverse
Fourier transform). Since D(Rn) ⊂S (Rn), in fact, it is clear that F(D(Rn)) ⊂
F(S (Rn)) ⊂S (Rn). This cannot be sharpened:

3.7 The Fourier–Plancherel Transform
181
Proposition 3.113 Take f ∈D(Rn). If F f ∈D(Rn) then f = 0. The same holds
for the inverse Fourier transform.
Proof The proof is easy, and we show it only for F, because the case F−is similar.
If
g(k) =

Rn
e−ik·x
(2π)n/2 f (x) dx ,
where f has compact support, the integral converges also for k ∈Cn. Using
Lebesgue’s dominated convergence, moreover, we can differentiate the components
ki of k inside the integral, and their real and imaginary parts. Since k →e−ik·x is
analytic (in each variable ki separately), it solves the Cauchy–Riemann equations in
each ki. Consequently also g will solve those equations in each ki, becoming analytic
on Cn. The restriction of g to Rn deﬁnes, via its real and imaginary parts, real analytic
maps on Rn. If g has compact support, there will be an open, non-empty set in Rn
where Re g and Im g vanish. A known property of real-analytic maps (of one real
variable) on open connected sets (here Rn) is that they vanish everywhere if they
vanish on an open non-empty set of the domain. Therefore if g has compact support
it must be the zero map. Then also f is zero, since F is invertible on S (Rn).
□
(2) Related to (1) is the known Paley-Wiener theorem (see for instance [KiGv82]):
Theorem 3.114 (Paley-Wiener) Take a > 0 and consider L2([−a, a], dx) as sub-
space of L2(R, dx). The space
ˆ
F(L2([−a, a], dx)) consists of maps g = g(k) that
can be extended uniquely to analytic maps on the complex plane (k ∈C) such that
|g(k)| ≤Ce2πa|Imk| ,
k ∈C
for some constant C ≥0 depending on g.
Since
ˆ
F(L2([−a, a], dx)) ⊂L2(R, dk) by Plancherel’s theorem, the result of
Paley-Wiener implies that analytic maps g bounded as above determine elements
of L2(R, dk) when k is real.
■
To conclude, consider the space L2((a, b), dx), where −∞≤a < b ≤+∞and dx
is the usual Lebesgue measure on R. The following extremely practical fact, used in
Example 3.32(4) to build bases, descends from the Fourier–Plancherel theory.
Proposition 3.115 Let f : (a, b) →C be a measurable map such that:
(1) the set {x ∈(a, b) | f (x) = 0} has zero measure,
(2) there exist C, δ > 0 for which | f (x)| < Ce−δ|x| for any x ∈(a, b).
Then the ﬁnite linear span of the maps x →xn f (x) =: fn(x), n = 0, 1, 2, . . .,
is dense in L2((a, b), dx).
Proof Let S := { fn}n∈N. It is enough to prove S⊥= {0}, because S⊥⊕< S > =
L2((a, b), dx) by Theorem 3.13. So take h ∈L2((a, b), dx) such that
 b
a
xn f (x)h(x)dx = 0

182
3
Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
for any n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Extend h to the whole real line by setting it to zero outside
(a, b), so now:

R
xn f (x)h(x)dx = 0 ,
(3.93)
for any n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Moreover, the following three facts hold:
(i) f · h ∈L1(R, dx): both maps are in L2(R, dx), so their product is in L1(R, dx);
(ii) f · h ∈L2(R, dx), because | f (x)|2 < C2e−2δ|x| < C2 < +∞and |h|2 is
integrable by assumption;
(iii) the map sending x ∈R to eδ′|x| f (x)h(x) is in L1(R, dx) for any δ′ < δ. In fact,
since x →|eδ′|x| f (x)| ≤Ce−(δ−δ′)|x|, the function x →eδ′|x| f (x) is in L2(R, dx),
and h ∈L2(R, dx) by hypothesis, so the product belongs to L1(R, dx).
Using (i) we compute the Fourier transform:
g(k) =

R
e−ik·x
√
2π
f (x)h(x) dx .
This coincides with the Fourier–Plancherel transform of f · h by (i), (ii) and Propo-
sition 3.111(a). Using (iii), if k is complex and |Imk| < δ, then g = g(k) is well
deﬁned and analytic on the open strip B ⊂C given by Rek ∈R, |Imk| < δ; this is
proved similarly to what we did in example (1). Lebesgue’s dominated convergence
and exchanging derivatives and integrals allow to see that
dng
dkn |k=0 = (−i)n
√
2π

R
xn f (x)h(x)dx
for any n = 0, 1, . . .. All derivatives vanish by (3.93), and so the Taylor expansion
of g at the origin is zero. This annihilates g on an open disc contained in B, so
analyticity guarantees g is zero on the open connected set B, and in particular on the
real line parametrised by k. Therefore the Fourier–Plancherel transform of f · h is
the null vector of L2(R, dk). Since the transform is unitary we conclude f · h = 0
almost everywhere on R: in particular on (a, b), where by assumption f ̸= 0 almost
everywhere. But then h = 0 almost everywhere on (a, b), which is to say each
h ∈S⊥coincides with the null element in L2((a, b), dx), ending the proof.

well, simply by replacing H2 with S(u, v) = S(v, u), and using real linear combi-
nations in H1.
Show that with this deﬁnition Proposition 3.3 still holds, provided the polarisation
formula is written as in (3.7).
3.4 (Hard.) Consider a real vector space and prove that if a (semi)norm p satisﬁes
the parallelogram rule (3.3):
p(x + y)2 + p(x −y)2 = 2(p(x)2 + p(y)2) ,
(3.94)
then there exists a unique (semi-)inner product S, deﬁned in Exercise 3.3, inducing
p via (3.2).
Solution. If S is a (semi-)inner product on the real vector space X, we have the
polarisation formula (3.7):
S(x, y) = 1
4 (S(x + y, x + y) −S(x −y, x −y)) .
This implies S is unique, for S(z, z) = p(z)2. For the existence from a given norm
p set:
S(x, y) := 1
4

p(x + y)2 −p(x −y)2
.
We shall prove S is a semi-inner product or an inner product according to whether
p is a norm or a seminorm. If this is true and p is a norm, then substituting S to p
above, on the right, gives S(x, x) = 0 and x = 0, making S an inner product.
To ﬁnish we need to prove, for any x, y, z ∈X:
(a) S(αx, y) = αS(x, y) if α ∈R,
(b) S(x + y, z) = S(x, z) + S(y, z),
(c) S(x, y) = S(y, x),
(d) S(x, x) = p(x)2.
Properties (c) and (d) are straightforward from the deﬁnition of S. Let us prove (a)
and (b). By (3.3) and the deﬁnition of S:
S(x, z) + S(y, z) = 4−1 
p(x + z)2 −p(x −z)2 + p(y + z)2 −p(y −z)2

(3.95)
Then (a) clearly implies (b), and we have to prove (a) only. Take y = 0 in (3.95) and
recall S(0, z) = 0 by deﬁnition of S. Then
S(x, z) = 2S(x/2, z) .
Iterating this formula gives (a) for α = m/2n, m, n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. These numbers are
dense in [0, +∞). At the same time R ∋α →p(αx + z) and R ∋α →p(αx −z)
are both continuous (in the topology induced by p), so
S(x, y) := 1
4 (p(x + y, x + y) −p(x −y, x −y))
allows to conclude R ∋α →S(αx, y) is continuous in α. That is to say, (a) holds
for any α ∈[0, +∞). Again by deﬁnition of S we have S(−x, y) = −S(x, y), so
the previous result is valid for any α ∈R, ending the proof.
3.5 (Hard.) Suppose a (semi)norm p satisﬁes the parallelogram rule (3.3):
p(x + y)2 + p(x −y)2 = 2(p(x)2 + p(y)2)
(3.96)
on a C-vector space. Show that there is a unique (semi-)inner product S inducing p
by means of (3.2).
Solution. If S is a (semi-)inner product on the complex vector space X we have
the polarisation formula (3.4):
4S(x, y) = S(x+y, x+y)−S(x−y, x−y)−iS(x+iy, x+iy)+iS(x−iy, x−iy).
Since S(z, z) = p(z)2, as in the real case, that implies uniqueness of S for a given
norm p on X. Existence: deﬁne, for a given (semi)norm p and x, y ∈X:
S1(x, y) := 4−1(p(x + y)2 −p(x −y)2) ,
S(x, y) := S1(x, y) −iS1(x, iy) .
Notice S(x, x) = p(x)2, and if p is a norm, by construction S(x, x) = 0 implies
x = 0. There remains to show that the above S is a Hermitian (semi-)inner product.
By Deﬁnition 3.1 we have to check:
(a) S(αx, y) = αS(x, y) if α ∈C,
(b) S(x + y, z) = S(x, z) + S(y, z),
(c) S(x, y) = S(y, x),

Exercises
185
(d) S(x, x) = p(x)2.
The last one is true by construction. Proceeding as in the previous exercise, using
S1 instead of S, we can prove (b) for S1, (a) for S1 with α ∈R, and also S1(x, y) =
S1(y, x). These, using the deﬁnition of S in terms of S1, imply (a), (b) and (c).
3.6 Let X be a real vector space equipped with a real inner product ⟨·, ·⟩and asso-
ciated norm || · ||. Prove that
||x1 + · · · + xn|| ≤||x1|| + · · · + ||xn|| ,
where
||x1 + · · · + xn|| = ||x1|| + · · · + ||xn||
if and only if xk = λkx for some x ∈X and λk ∈[0, +∞) for all k = 1, . . . , n.
Hint. First show that ||x1 + · · · + x p|| ≤||x1|| + · · · + ||x p||. Then prove the
second part of the thesis for n = 2, using the fact that |⟨x, y⟩| = ||x|| ||y|| ⇔x
and y are linearly independent, then extend the result using induction. Observe that
||x1 + · · · + x p + x p+1|| = ||x1|| + · · · + ||x p|| + ||x p+1|| implies ||x1 + · · · + x p|| =
||x1|| + · · · + ||x p|| since ||x1 + · · · + x p + x p+1|| ≤||x1 + · · · + x p|| + ||x p+1||.
3.7 Prove the claim in Remark 3.4(1) on a (semi-)inner product space (X, S): the
(semi-)inner product S : X×X →C is continuous in the product topology of X×X,
having on X the topology induced by the (semi-)inner product itself. Consequently
S is continuous in both arguments separately.
Hint. Suppose X × X ∋(xn, yn) →(x, y) ∈X × X as n →+∞. Use the
Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to show that if S is the (semi-)inner product associated
to p, then:
|S(x, y) −S(xn, yn)| ≤p(xn)p(yn −y) + p(xn −x)p(y) .
Recall that p(xn) →p(x) and that the canonical projections are continuous in the
product topology.
3.8 Prove Proposition 3.8: a linear operator L : X →Y between inner product
spaces is an isometry, in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.6, if and only if
||Lx||Y = ||x||X
for any x ∈X,
where norms are associated to the respective inner products.
Hint. Polarise.

3.11 In the Hilbert space H consider a sequence {xn}n∈N ⊂H converging to x ∈H

in the topology of H. However, if we additionally assume ||xn|| →||x||, n →+∞,
then xn →x, n →+∞, also in the topology of H.
Hint. Riesz’s theorem implies that {xn}n∈N ⊂H weakly converges to x ∈H iff
(z|xn) →(z|x), n →+∞, for any z ∈H. Let {xn}n∈N be a basis of H, thought of as
separable. Then xn →0 weakly but not in the topology of H. For the second claim,
note ||x −xn||2 = ||x||2 + ||xn||2 −2Re(x|xn).

Outline. It sufﬁces to prove that the space < sn >n=1,2,... of ﬁnite linear com-
binations of the sn is dense in D((0, L)) for || ||∞, because this would imply, by
elementary integral properties, that they are dense in the topology of L2([0, L], dx).
Since D((0, L)) is dense in L2([0, L], dx), we would have < sn >n=1,2,... dense in
L2([0, L], dx). Because {sn}n=1,2,... is an orthonormal system (Exercise 3.16), this
would in turn imply the claim, by Theorem 3.26. To show that < sn >n=1,2,... is dense
in D((0, L)) with respect to || ||∞, ﬁx f ∈D((0, L)) and extend it to F on [−L, L]
by imposing F be an odd map. By construction F is in D((−L, L)) and satisﬁes
F(−L) = F(L), because it and its derivatives vanish around x = 0 and x = ±L. A

3.21 LetHbeaHilbertspaceand T : D(T ) →Halinearoperator,where D(T ) ⊂H
is a dense subspace in H (D(T ) = H, possibly). Prove that if (u|T u) = 0 for any
u ∈D(T ) then T = 0, i.e. T is the null operator (sending everything to 0).
Solution. We have
0 = (u + v|T (u + v)) = (u|T u) + (v|T v) + (u|T v) + (v|T u) = (u|T v) + (v|T u)
and similarly
0 = i(u + iv|T (u + iv)) = i(u|Tu) + i(v|T v) −(u|T v) + (v|T u) = −(u|T v) + (v|T u) .
Adding these two gives (v|T u) = 0 for any u, v ∈D(T ). Choose {vn}n∈N ⊂D(T )
such that vn →T u, n →+∞. Then ||T u||2 = (T u|T u) = limn→+∞(vn|T u) = 0

3.30 Let U : H →H be a bounded operator over a Hilbert space H. Prove that if
(x|y) = 0 implies (Ux|Uy) = 0 for x, y ∈H and U ̸= 0, then there is a > 0 such
that V := aU is isometric.
Solution. The ﬁrst part of the hypothesis can be rephrased as y ⊥x implies
y ⊥U ∗Ux. As a consequence U ∗Ux ∈{{x}⊥}⊥which is the linear span of x.
In other words, if x ∈H then U ∗Ux = λxx for some λx ∈C. Let us prove
that λx does not depend on x. To this end, consider a couple of vectors x ⊥y
with x, y ̸= 0. Using the argument above we have U ∗Ux = λxx ,
U ∗Uy =
λyy,
U ∗U(x+y) = λx+y(x+y). Linearity ofU ∗U applied to the last identity leads
to U ∗Ux +U ∗Uy = λx+yx +λx+y y, namely U ∗Ux −λx+yx = −(U ∗Uy−λx+y y).
Exploiting U ∗Ux = λxx and U ∗Uy = λyy we get (λx −λx+y)x = −(λy −λx+y)y.
Since x ⊥y and x, y ̸= {0}, the only possibility is that λx = λx+y = λy. In summary,

3.31 Let A be a C∗-algebra without unit. Consider the direct sum A ⊕C and deﬁne
the product:
(x, c) · (y, c′) := (x ◦y + cy + c′x, cc′),
(x′, c′), (x, c) ∈A ⊕C ,
where ◦is the product on A. Deﬁne the norm:
||(x, c)|| := sup{||cy + xy|| | y ∈A, ||y|| = 1}
and the involution: (x, c)∗= (x∗, c), where c is the complex conjugate of c and the
involution on the right is the one of A. Prove that the vector space A ⊕C with the
above structure is a C∗-algebra with unit (0, 1).
Hint. The triangle inequality is easy. The proof that ||(x, c)|| = 0 implies c = 0
and x = 0 goes as follows. If c = 0, ||(x, 0)|| = 0 means ||x|| = 0, so x = 0.
If c ̸= 0, we can simply look at c = 1. In that case ||y + xy|| ≤||y|| ||(x, 1)||,
so ||(x, 1)|| = 0 implies y = xy for any y ∈A. Using the involution we have
y = yx∗for any y ∈B. In particular x∗= xx∗= x, and then y = xy = yx
for any y ∈A. Therefore x is the unit of A, a contradiction. Hence c = 0 is the
only possibility, and we fall back to the previous case. Let us see to the C∗prop-
erties of the norm. By deﬁnition of norm: ||(c, x)||2 = sup{||cy + xy||2 | y ∈
A, ||y|| = 1} = sup{||y∗(ccy + cxy + cx∗y + x∗xy)|| | y ∈A, ||y|| = 1}.
Hence ||(c, x)||2 ≤||(c, x)∗(c, x)|| ≤||(c, x)∗|| ||(c, x)||. In particular ||(c, x)|| ≤
||(c, x)∗||, and replacing (c, x) with (c, x)∗gives ||(c, x)∗|| = ||(c, x)||. The

192

inequality ||(c, x)||2 ≤||(c, x)∗(c, x)|| ≤||(c, x)∗|| ||(c, x)|| implies ||(c, x)||2 ≤
||(c, x)∗(c, x)|| ≤||(c, x)||2, and so ||(c, x)||2 = ||(c, x)∗(c, x)||.
3.32 Prove Proposition 3.55:
Proposition. Let A be a ∗-algebra with unit, H a Hilbert space, and consider a linear
map φ : A →B(H) which preserves the products and the involutions. The following
facts hold.
(a) Hφ := Ran(φ(I)) and H⊥
φ are closed subspaces of H satisfying H = Hφ ⊕H⊥
φ ,
and each subspace is invariant under φ(a), for every a ∈A.
(b) φ(a)↾H⊥
φ = 0 for every a ∈A.
(c) The restriction to the complement
πφ : A ∋a →φ(a)↾Hφ∈B(Hφ)
is a representation of A over Hφ according to Deﬁnition 3.52. It also satisﬁes
(i) πφ is faithful ⇔φ is injective;
(ii) πφ(a) is the zero representation ⇔φ(I) = 0 (in this case Hφ = {0});
(iii) πφ = φ if φ is surjective;
(iv) πφ = φ if φ is not the zero map and irreducible (i.e. there are no closed subspaces
M of H with {0} ⊊M ⊊H and such that φ(a)(M) ⊂M for every a ∈A).
Solution. (a) First of all we notice that P := φ(I) is an orthogonal projector
because P P = φ(I)φ(I) = φ(II) = φ(I) = P and P∗= φ(I)∗= φ(I∗) =
φ(I) = φ, where we have used Proposition 3.44(c). Therefore Hφ := P(H) is a
closed subspace by Proposition 2.101(b). Moreover I −P projects orthogonally
onto H⊥
φ , and H = Hφ ⊕H⊥
φ by Proposition 3.64(a, b). Now observe that Pφ(a) =
φ(I)φ(a) = φ(Ia) = φ(a) = φ(aI) = φ(a)P, which entails that Hφ is invariant
under every φ(a). The same fact holds for H⊥
φ when we replace P by I −P in the
previous argument. (b) If x ∈H⊥
φ , φ(a)x = φ(a)(I −P)x = φ(a)x −φ(aI)x =
φ(a)x −φ(a)x = 0. (c) Since P restricts to the identity map I on Hφ, we have
φ(a)↾Hφ (I) = I. Then the restriction A ∋a →π(a) := φ(a)↾Hφ is a representation
on the Hilbert space Hφ in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.52, because it is linear and it
preserves the product and the involution, as the reader immediately proves using
the same properties of φ. (i) It is obvious that πφ(a) = 0 ⇔φ(a) = 0, since
φ(a)↾H⊥
φ = 0 and this is the same as saying that πφ is injective (faithful) if and only
if φ is injective. (ii) If πφ is the zero representation then πφ(I) = 0 in particular,
and hence φ(I) = 0 as well, by construction. If φ(I) = 0 then πφ(I) = 0 and so
πφ(a) = πφ(Ia) = πφ(I)πφ(a) = 0πφ(a) = 0 for every a ∈A. (If φ(I) = 0, we
also have Hφ = P(H) = {0} since P = φ(I).) (iii) If φ is surjective, there exists
a1 ∈A with φ(a1) = I so I = φ(a1) = φ(Ia1) = φ(I)φ(a1) = φ(I)I = φ(I) = P.
Therefore Hφ = H, which implies φ = πφ. (iv) M := P(H) satisﬁes φ(a)(M) ⊂M
for every a ∈A, so either M = H, and thus φ = πφ as we wanted, or M = {0}. The
latter is forbidden by hypothesis, because it would imply φ(a) = 0 for every a ∈A.

3.34 Prove that a von Neumann algebra R on a Hilbert space H is complete in the
strong operator topology. In other words, given {An}n∈N ⊂R such that {Anx}n∈N is
Cauchy in H for every ﬁxed x ∈H, there exists A ∈R such that An →A strongly
(the converse being trivially true).
Solution. As R is strongly closed in B(H), it is enough to prove that B(H)
is strongly complete. Fix x ∈H. As {Anx}n∈N is Cauchy, Ax := limn→+∞Anx
does exist. Linearity of each An implies linearity of A : H ∋x →Ax. There
remains to prove that A is bounded. As Anx admits limit, we have ||Anx|| < +∞
for every x ∈H and every n ∈N. The Banach–Steinhaus Theorem 2.62 implies that
||An|| < S < +∞for every n ∈N. Moreover, if x ∈H, for every εx > 0 there is
nεx ∈N such that ||(A −An)x|| < εx if n > nεx. Summing up,
||Ax|| ≤||Ax −Anx|| + ||Anx|| < εx + S||x|| for n > nεx.
Since εx > 0 is arbitrary,
||Ax|| ≤S||x|| ∀x ∈H ,
which entails ||A|| ≤S < +∞and therefore A ∈B(H).
3.35 Prove that a von Neumann algebra R on a Hilbert space H is complete in the
weak operator topology. In other words, if {An}n∈N ⊂R is such that {(y|Anx)}n∈N
is Cauchy in C for every ﬁxed x, y ∈H, then there exists A ∈R such that An →A
weakly (the converse being trivially true).
Solution. As R is weakly closed in B(H), it sufﬁces to prove that B(H) is weakly
complete. Fix x, y ∈H. As {(y|Anx)}n∈N is Cauchy, Ayx := limn→+∞(y|Anx) ∈C
exists. Each An is linear and the inner product is Hermitian, so H ∋x →Ayx is linear
and H ∋y →Ayx antilinear. We claim there exist a linear operator A : H →H such
that Ayx = (y|Ax) for every x, y ∈H. For x, y ∈H ﬁxed, |(y|Anx)| < +∞for
every n ∈N. Therefore, for ﬁxed x, applying the Banach–Steinhaus Theorem 2.62
to the family of linear functionals H ∋y →(y|Anx), we conclude that there is a
positive number Sx < +∞satisfying ||(·|Anx)|| < Sx uniformly in n. Moreover, if
y ∈H, for every εy > 0 there is nεy ∈N such that |Ayx −(y|Anx)| < εy if n > nεy.
Summing up,
|Ayx| ≤|Ayx −(y|Anx)| + |(y|Anx)| < εy + Sx||y|| for n > nεy.
Since εy > 0 is arbitrary,
|Ayx| ≤Sx||y|| ∀y ∈H ,

194

Hilbert Spaces and Bounded Operators
which entails ||A·x|| ≤Sx < +∞. Therefore Riesz’s lemma proves that there exists
Ax ∈H with
Ayx = (y|Ax) ∀y ∈H .
It easy to prove that H ∋x →Ax =: Ax is linear. So now we have a linear
operator A : H →H such that (y|Anx) →(y|Ax) for every x, y ∈H. To ﬁnish it
sufﬁces to prove that A is bounded. Since (A∗
ny|x) = (y|Anx) we know the sequence
{(A∗
ny|x)}n∈N is Cauchy for every choice of x, y ∈H. Repeating the procedure
above, there exists an operator B : H →H such that (A∗
ny|x) →(By|x) for every
x, y ∈H, so that (y|Ax) = (By|x) for every x, y ∈H. This identity easily implies
that B is closed (Deﬁnition 2.98). Applying the closed graph Theorem 2.99, we
conclude that B ∈B(H). The identity (y|Ax) = (By|x), x, y ∈H, rewritten as
(Ax|y) = (x|By) = (B∗x|y), implies A = B∗∈B(H).
3.36 Let H, K be complex Hilbert spaces, A ⊂B(H) and B ⊂B(K) unital C∗-
algebras of operators, and φ : A →B a continuous linear map relatively to the
strong operator topology (or weak operator topology) of both A and B. Prove that φ
extends uniquely to a continuous linear map Φ : A′′ →B′′ relatively to the strong
operator topology (resp. weak operator topology) both on A′′ and B′′.
Solution. Let us treat the case of strong topologies. Since A is strongly dense
in A′′, any strongly continuous extension Φ must be unique. Let us prove that Φ
exists by using Exercise 3.34. Since A is dense in A′′, if A ∈A′′ there is a sequence
{An}n∈N ∈A converging to A strongly. Deﬁne Φ(A) := s-limn→+∞φ(An). First of
all we prove that {φ(An)}n∈N ⊂B′′ is Cauchy (with respect to the strong operator
topology) and hence its limit belongs to B′′, which is complete in that topology as
established in Exercise 3.34. Fix a seminorm py(·) := || · y|| in B(K) associated to
the vector y ∈K. Since φ is strongly continuous, for every ε > 0 there is an open set
Oy,ε containing 0 ∈B(H), given by intersecting a ﬁnite number of balls deﬁned by
seminorms px(y)
1 , . . . px(y)
ny . The vectors x(y)
k
and the number ny also depend on ε, with
py(φ(A)) < ε if A ∈Oy,ε ∩A. In other words ||φ(A)y|| < ε if ny
k=1 ||Ax(y)
k || < δ
for some δ > 0 depending on y and ε. If A does not satisfy the last condition,
A′ :=
δA
ny
k=1 ||Ax(y)
k || certainly will. Therefore, for every y ∈K there is a constant
Cy ≥0 (= ε/δ) and there are vectors x(y)
1 , . . . , x(y)
ny ∈H, such that
||φ(A)y|| ≤Cy
ny

k=1
||Ax(y)
k || ∀A ∈A .
This inequality implies that the sequence {φ(An)}n∈N is Cauchy in the strong operator
topology if {An}n∈N is. We conclude that Φ(A) := s-limn→+∞φ(An) is well deﬁned.
Notice that a different sequence {A′
n}n∈N tending to A (strongly) would produce the
same limit, because

fore clear that Φ extends φ, because for any A ∈A we may deﬁne Φ(A) :=
s-limn→+∞φ(An), using a constant sequence An = A. The limiting process used
to deﬁne Φ immediately proves that Φ is linear as well, since φ is. Regarding the
strong continuity of Φ, observe that, by construction
||Φ(A)y|| =

n→+∞φ(An)y

Since Anx(y)

inequality is equivalent to the continuity of Φ in the strong topology of the two von
Neumann algebras A′′ and B′′.
The case of weak topologies is completely analogous if we replace the seminorms
px(·) = || · x|| with the seminorms px,y(·) = |(x| · y)|. Then Φ is the unique
map satisfying (x|Φ(A)y) = limn→+∞(x|φ(An)y) for x, y ∈K, A ∈A′′ and
A ∋An →A weakly.
3.37 Let H, K be complex Hilbert spaces, A ⊂B(H) and B ⊂B(K) unital C∗-
algebras of operators. Prove that a continuous ∗-homomorphism φ : A →B (rel-
atively to the weak operator topology of A and B) extends to a unique continuous
∗-homomorphism of von Neumann algebras Φ : A′′ →B′′ (in the weak topology).
Solution. As φ is linear it deﬁnes a unique weakly continuous linear extension
Φ : A′′ →B′′, as established in Exercise 3.36. We shall exploit the fact that A is
weaklydenseinA′′,bythedoublecommutanttheorem.Theclaimis that Φ(IH) = IK,
Φ(A∗H) = Φ(A)∗K and Φ(A◦H B) = Φ(A)◦K Φ(B) for A, B ∈A′′. (We henceforth
omit the subscripts H,K for simplicity.) The ﬁrst requirement automatically holds
because it is valid for φ. Let us prove Φ(A∗) = Φ(A)∗. If A ∋An →A weakly,
then A ∋A∗
n →A∗weakly. From now on all limits will be meant in the weak sense.
We have

Φ(A∗) =

because Φ is weakly continuous and extends the ∗-homomorphism φ. To conclude,
we need to establish Φ(AB) = Φ(A)Φ(B) for A, B ∈A′′. Let us start by assuming
A ∈A′′ but B ∈A. Then A ∋An →A weakly implies A ∋An B →AB weakly.
Therefore, by the very deﬁnition of Φ:
Φ(AB) =
lim
n→+∞Φ(An B) =

n→+∞φ(An B) =

n→+∞φ(An)φ(B)

n→+∞φ(An)Φ(B) = Φ(A)Φ(B) ,
where we have used the fact that φ(An) →Φ(A) weakly implies φ(An)Φ(B) →
Φ(A)Φ(B) weakly. (With a similar proof, Φ(AB) = Φ(A)Φ(B) holds true also if
A ∈A but B ∈A′′.) Let us ﬁnally focus on the general case A, B ∈A′′. Since Φ is
weakly continuous, and A ∋Bn →B ∈A′′ weakly implies ABn →AB, we have:
Φ(AB) =
lim
n→+∞Φ(ABn) =

n→+∞Φ(A)Φ(Bn) = Φ(A)Φ(B) .
3.38 Let H be a complex Hilbert space and suppose h : B(H) →B(H) is an
antilinear map preserving the product, the operation ∗, and ﬁxing the identity: h(I) =
I. Prove that if h is bijective, then there exists an isometric and surjective antilinear
map U : H →H (called an anti-unitary operator) such that h(A) = U AU −1.
Hint. If N ⊂H is a Hilbert basis, deﬁne the map C : H →H by

for every z ∈H. Next, set α(A) := Ch(A)C−1 for every A ∈B(H), so that the map

Families of Compact Operators on Hilbert
Spaces and Fundamental Properties
Measure what can be measured, and make measurable what
can’t be.
Galilei
The aim of this chapter, from the point of view of quantum mechanical applications,
is to introduce certain types of operators used to deﬁne quantum states in the standard
formulation of the theory. These operators, known in the literature as operators of
trace class, or nuclear operators, are bounded operators on a Hilbert space that admit
a trace. In order to introduce them it is necessary to deﬁne ﬁrst compact operators,
also known as completely continuous operators, which play an important role in
several branches of mathematics and physical applications irrespective of quantum
theories.
The ﬁrst section introduces compact operators on normed spaces, then brieﬂy
discussesgeneralpropertiesinnormedandBanachspaces.Wewillprovetheclassical
result on the non-compactness of the inﬁnite-dimensional unit ball.
In section two we specialise to Hilbert spaces, with an eye to L2 spaces where com-
pact operators (such as Hilbert–Schmidt operators) admit an integral representation.
We will show that compact operators determine a closed ∗-ideal in the C∗-algebra
of bounded operators on a Hilbert space, hence, a fortiori, a C∗-subalgebra. We will
prove Hilbert’s celebrated theorem on the spectral expansion of compact operators,
to be considered as a precursor of all spectral decomposition results of subsequent
chapters.
The ∗-ideal of Hilbert–Schmidt operators and their elementary properties are the
subject of section four. We will show that Hilbert–Schmidt operators form a Hilbert
space.
The penultimate section is concerned with the ∗-ideal of operators of trace class,
and the basic (and most useful in physics) properties. In particular we shall prove

that the trace of a product of operators is invariant under cyclic permutations of the
factors.
The ﬁnal section is devoted to a short introduction to Fredholm’s alternative
theorem for Fredholm’s integral equations of the second kind.
4.1
Compact Operators on Normed and Banach Spaces
This section deals with compact operators on normed spaces. We start by recall-
ing general results about compact subsets in normed spaces, especially inﬁnite-
dimensional ones. In the next section we shall discuss the theory in Hilbert spaces.
4.1.1
Compact Sets in (Inﬁnite-Dimensional) Normed Spaces
CompactnessinacompletelygeneraltopologicalspaceX wasaddressedinDeﬁnition
1.19, which we recall below.
Deﬁnition Let (X, T ) be a topological space and K ⊂X a subset. One says that
(a) K is compact if any open covering of it admits a ﬁnite sub-covering: if
{Ai}i∈I ⊂T , ∪i∈I Ai ⊃K, em then ∪i∈J Ai ⊃K for some ﬁnite subset J ⊂I;
(b) K is relatively compact if K is compact;
(c) X is locally compact if every point admits a relatively compact open neighbour-
hood.
Related to this is the notion of sequential compactness.
Deﬁnition 4.1 A subset K in a topological space is sequentially compact if any
sequence {xn}n∈N ⊂K has a subsequence {xn p}p∈N that converges in K.
Remark 4.2 Let us list below a few general features of compact sets that should be
known from basic topology courses (Ser94II). We shall make use of them later.
(1) Compactness is hereditary, in the sense that it is passed on to induced topologies
(cf. Remark 1.22(2)).
(2) Closed subsets in compact sets are compact, and in Hausdorff spaces (like normed
vector spaces or Hilbert spaces), compact sets are closed.
(3) In metrisable spaces (in particular normed vector spaces, Hilbert spaces), com-
pactness is equivalent to sequential compactness.
■
The next, useful, property is also valid in metric spaces.
Proposition 4.3 Let (X, || ||) be a normed space and A ⊂X. If any sequence in A
admits a converging subsequence (not in A necessarily), then A is relatively compact.

4.1 Compact Operators on Normed and Banach Spaces
199
Proof The only thing to prove is that {yk}k∈N ⊂A admits a subsequence that
converges (in A, A being closed). Given {yk}k∈N ⊂A, there will be sequences
{x(k)
n }n∈N ⊂A, one for each k, with x(k)
n
→yk as n →+∞. Fix k and pick a number
nk large enough to construct, term by term, a new sequence {zk := x(k)
nk }k∈N ⊂A such
that ||yk −zk|| < 1/k. Under the assumptions made on A there will be a subsequence
{zkp}p∈N of {zk}k∈N converging to some y ∈A. Then
||ykp −y|| ≤||ykp −zkp|| + ||zkp −y|| .
Since 1/kp →0 when p →+∞, for any given ε > 0 there will be P such that, if
p > P, ||zkp −y|| < ε/2 and 1/kp < ε/2, so ||ykp −y|| < ε. In other words ykp →
y as p →+∞.
⊓⊔
Remark 4.4 This proposition holds on metric spaces too, and the proof is the same
with minor modiﬁcations.
■
Examples of compact sets in an inﬁnite-dimensional normed space (X, || ||) are
easily obtained from ﬁnite-dimensional subspaces. As we know from Sect.2.5, any
ﬁnite-dimensional space S is homeomorphic to Cn (or Rn for real vector spaces).
Therefore any closed and bounded set K ⊂S (e.g., the closure of an open ball of
ﬁnite radius) is compact in S by the Heine–Borel theorem. Since compactness is
a hereditary property (cf. Remark 1.22(2)) K is compact also in the topology of
(X, || ||).
The following is an important result, that discriminates between ﬁnite- and inﬁnite-
dimensional normed spaces. We leave to the reader the proof of the fact that the
closure of an open ball in a normed space is nothing but the corresponding closed
ball with the same centre and radius:
{x ∈X | ||x −x0|| < r} = {x ∈X | ||x −x0|| ≤r} .
Proposition 4.5 Let(X, || ||)beanormedspaceofinﬁnitedimension.Theclosureof
the open unit ball {x ∈X | ||x|| < 1} (that is, the closed unit ball {x ∈X | ||x|| ≤1})
cannot be compact.
The same is true for any ball, with arbitrary centre and positive, ﬁnite radius.
Proof Let us indicate by B the open unit ball centred at the origin, and suppose by
contradiction that B is compact. Then we can cover B, hence B, with N > 0 open
balls Bk of radius 1/2 centred at certain points xk, k = 1, . . . , N. Consider a subspace
Xn in X, of ﬁnite dimension n, containing the vectors xk. Since dim X is inﬁnite, we
may choose n > N as large as we want. Deﬁne further “balls” P := B ∩Xn of radius
1 and Pk := Bk ∩Xn, k = 1, . . . , N, all of radius 1/2. Let us identify Xn with R2n (or
Rn if the base ﬁeld is R) by choosing a basis of Xn, say {zk}k=1,...,n. Notice that a “ball”
Pk does not necessarily have the round shape of a Euclidean ball. If we normalise the
Lebesguemeasurem onR2n bydividingbythevolumeof P (non-zerosince P isopen
and non-empty by Proposition 2.107), then m(P) = 1. We claim m(Pk) = (1/2)n.
The Lebesgue measure is translation-invariant, so we may only consider balls B(r)

200
4
Families of Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces and Fundamental Properties
centred at the origin of radius r. Since every norm is a homogeneous function,
B(λr) = {λu | u ∈B(r)} =: λB(r) for any λ > 0. The Lebesgue measure on R2n
satisﬁes m(λE) = λ2nm(E), hence m(Pk) = m((1/2)P) = (1/2)nm(P) = (1/2)n.
Eventually, as B ⊂∪N
k=1Bk and P ⊂∪N
k=1Pk, we have m(P) ≤N
k=1 m(Pk) by sub-
additivity, i.e. 1 ≤N(1/2)2n. But this is impossible if n is large enough (N is ﬁxed).
The argument is completely analogous for open balls of ﬁnite radius centred at any
other point in the space.
⊓⊔
The next result explains, once more, how compact sets acquire ‘counter-intuitive’
properties when passing to inﬁnitely many dimensions. In the standard spaces Cn or
Rn there exist compact sets with non-empty interior: it is enough to close a bounded
open set, for the Heine–Borel theorem warrants that the closure (still bounded) is
compact and clearly has points in its interior.
The complete space C can be viewed as the countable union of compact subsets:
take all open discs with rational centres and rational radii. In the inﬁnite-dimensional
case, instead, the picture changes dramatically.
Corollary 4.6 Let X be a normed space of inﬁnite dimension.
(a) If K ⊂X is compact, the interior of K is empty.
(b) If X is also complete (i.e. a Banach space), X cannot be obtained as a countable
union of compact subsets.
Proof (a) If the interior of K were not empty, it would contain an open ball B,
since open balls form a basis for the topology. Compact subsets are closed because
normed spaces are Hausdorff, so B ⊂K = K, and closed subsets in compact sets
are compact, hence B would be compact, contradicting the previous proposition.
(b) The claim follows from (a) and the last statement in Baire’s Theorem 2.93, where
X is our complete normed space.
⊓⊔
4.1.2
Compact Operators on Normed Spaces
We are ready to introduce compact operators.
Recall that a subset M in a normed space (X, || ||) is bounded (relative to || ||) if
there is an open ball Bδ(x0), of ﬁnite radius δ > 0 and centred at some x0 ∈X, such
that M ⊂Bδ(x0).
Clearly, M is bounded if and only if there is a metric ball of ﬁnite radius δ > 0
and centred at the origin of X, containing M (just choose δ + ||x0|| as radius).
Deﬁnition 4.7 Let X, Y be normed spaces over R or C. The operator T ∈L(X, Y) is
called compact (or completely continuous) when either of the following equivalent
conditions holds:
(a) for any bounded subset M ⊂X, T (M) is relatively compact in Y;
(b) if {xn}n∈N ⊂X is bounded, there is a subsequence {xnk}k∈N such that {T xnk}k∈N
converges in Y.

4.1 Compact Operators on Normed and Banach Spaces
201
The set of compact operators from X to Y is indicated by B∞(X, Y), and
B∞(X) := B∞(X, X) is the set of compact operators on X.
Remark 4.8 (1) Clearly (a) ⇒(b). The opposite implication (b) ⇒(a) is an imme-
diate consequence of Proposition 4.3.
(2) Any compact operator is certainly bounded, for it maps the unit closed ball cen-
tred at the origin to a set (containing the origin) with compact closure K. The latter
can be covered by N open balls of radius r > 0, say Br(yi). Then K ⊂∪N
i=1Br(yi) ⊂
BR+r(0), where R is the largest distance between the centres yi and the origin. In
particular ||T (x)|| ≤(R + r) for ||x|| = 1, so ||T || ≤r + R < +∞.
■
The sets B∞(X, Y) and B∞(X) are actually vector spaces under the usual linear
combinations of operators, hence subspaces of B(X, Y) and B(X) respectively. But
there is more:
Proposition 4.9 If X, Y are normed spaces, then
(a) B∞(X, Y) is a vector subspace of B(X, Y).
(b) if Z is a normed space and A ∈B∞(X, Y):
(i) B ∈B(Z, X) implies AB ∈B∞(Z, Y),
(ii) B ∈B(Y, Z) implies B A ∈B∞(X, Z);
(c) If, additionally, Y is a Banach space and {An}n∈N ⊂B∞(X, Y) converges uni-
formly to A ∈B(X, Y), then A ∈B∞(X, Y). In other words B∞(X, Y) is a closed
subspace in the Banach space (B(X, Y), || ||), where || || is the operator norm.
Proof (a) Consider the operator αA + βB, α, β ∈C, A, B ∈B∞(X, Y). Let us
prove it is compact by showing that any bounded sequence {xn}n∈N ⊂X has a sub-
sequence {xnr }r∈N ⊂X whose image {(αA + βB)(xnr )}r∈N ⊂Y converges.
Let {xn}n∈N ⊂X be a bounded sequence. There is a subsequence {xnk}k∈N for
which Axnk ⊂Y converges, as A is compact. The subsequence {xnk}k∈N is also
bounded by assumption, so there is a sub-subsequence {xnkm }m∈N such that Bxnkm ∈Y
converges. Now, by construction, {xnkm }m∈N is a subsequence of {xnk}k∈N for which
αAxnkm + βBxnkm ⊂Y converges.
(b) In case (i), if {zk}k∈N ⊂Z is bounded by M > 0, the set {Bzk}k∈N is bounded
by ||B||M, as B is bounded. But A is compact, so there is a subsequence {znk}k∈N
for which ABznk converges. Thus AB is compact. In case (ii), as A is compact, if
{xk}k∈N ⊂X is bounded there is a subsequence {xnk}k∈N such that the Axnk converge.
Since B is continuous, also the B Axnk converge, and so B A is compact.
(c) Let B(X, Y) ∋A = limi→+∞Ai with Ai ∈B∞(X, Y). Take a bounded sequence
{xn}n∈N in X: ||xn|| ≤C for any n. We want to prove the existence of a convergent
subsequence of {Axn}. Using a hopefully-clear notation, we build recursively a fam-
ily of subsequences:
{xn} ⊃{x(1)
n } ⊃{x(2)
n } ⊃· · ·
(4.1)
such that, for any i = 1, 2, . . ., {x(i+1)
n
} is a subsequence of {x(i)
n } with {Ai+1x(i+1)

convergent. This is always possible, because any {x(i)
n } is bounded by C, being a

Given ε > 0, if n is large enough then 2C||A −An|| ≤ε/2, since An →A. Fix

{An(x(n)

onal” terms of all those subsequences, each of which is a subsequence of the pre-
ceding one by (4.1); moreover, it is still a subsequence of the convergent sequence
{An(x(n)

⊓⊔
Keeping in mind Proposition 2.74, a remarkable property of compact operators
is spelt out by the next fact.
Proposition 4.10 Let X, Y be normed spaces. If X ∋xn →x ∈X weakly and T ∈
B∞(X, Y), then ||T (xn) −T (x)||Y →0 as n →+∞. In words, compact operators
map weakly convergent sequences to sequences that converge in norm.
Proof See Exercise 4.5.
⊓⊔
The last general property of compact operators on normed spaces concerns eigenval-
ues. We will give a proof before moving on to compact operators on Hilbert spaces.
Theorem 4.11 (On the eigenvalues of compact operators on normed spaces) Let X
be a normed space and T ∈B∞(X).
(a) For any δ > 0 there exist ﬁnitely many λ-eigenspaces of T such that |λ| > δ.
(b) If λ ̸= 0 is an eigenvalue of T , the λ-eigenspace has ﬁnite dimension.
(c) The eigenvalues of T , in general complex numbers, form a bounded, at most
countable, set; they can be ordered by decreasing modulus:
|λ1| ≥|λ2| ≥· · · 0,
with 0 as unique possible limit point.
Proof We shall need a lemma in order to prove parts (a) and (b).

4.1 Compact Operators on Normed and Banach Spaces
203
Lemma 4.12 (Banach) Let x1, x2, . . . be a (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) sequence of linearly
independent vectors in a normed space X, and set Xn :=< {x1, x2, . . . , xn} >. Then
there exists a corresponding sequence y1, y2, . . . ⊂X such that:
(i) ||yn|| = 1,
(ii) yn ∈Xn,
(iii) d(yn, Xn−1) > 1/2,
for any n = 1, 2, . . ., where
d(yn, Xn−1) =
inf
x∈Xn−1 ||x −yn||
is the distance of yn to Xn−1.
Proof of lemma 4.12. Observe d(yn, Xn−1) exists and is ﬁnite, since it is the inﬁmum
of a non-empty set of real numbers bounded from below by 0. Choose y1 := x1/||x1||
and build the sequence {yn} inductively, as follows. The vectors x1, x2, . . . are linearly
independent, so xn /∈Xn−1 and d(xn, Xn−1) = α > 0. So let x′ ∈Xn−1 be such that
α < ||xn −x′|| < 2α. As α = d(xn, Xn−1) = d(xn −x′, Xn−1), the vector
yn :=
xn −x′
||xn −x′||
satisﬁes (i), (ii), (iii).
⊓⊔
Let us resume the proof of (a) and (b). If X is ﬁnite-dimensional the claims hold
because eigenvectors with distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent. So con-
sider X inﬁnite-dimensional, where there can be inﬁnitely many eigenvalues and
eigenvectors. The proof of both (a) and (b) follows simultaneously from the exis-
tence, for any δ > 0, of a ﬁnite number of linearly independent λ-eigenvectors with
|λ| > δ. Let us prove that, then. Let λ1, λ2, . . . be a sequence of eigenvalues of T ,
possibly repeated, such that |λn| > δ. Assume, by contradiction, there is an inﬁnite
sequence x1, x2, . . ., of corresponding linearly independent eigenvectors. We are
claiming, by refuting the theorem, that there are inﬁnitely many linearly independent
λ-eigenvectors such that |λ| > δ. Using Banach’s lemma, construct the sequence
y1, y2, . . . fulﬁlling (i), (ii) and (iii), where Xn is spanned by x1, x2, . . . , xn. Since
|λn| > δ, the sequence { yn
λn }n=1,2,... is bounded. We will show that we cannot extract
a convergent subsequence from the images {T yn
λn }n=1,2,.... By construction, in fact,

Therefore we have to conclude that an inﬁnite sequence of linearly independent
eigenvectors x1, x2, . . . cannot exist. This ends the proof of (a) and (b).
(c) This part follows from (a) by picking a sequence of numbers δ > 0 of the form
δn = 1/n, n = 1, 2, 3, . . ..
⊓⊔
Remark 4.13 (1) One ﬁnal property, that we shall not prove, states that in the Banach
setting the adjoint operator (cf. Deﬁnition 2.45) to a compact operator is compact.
We will prove it for Hermitian adjoints to compact operators on Hilbert spaces.
(2) From Lemma 4.12 descends an alternative proof that the closed unit ball in an
inﬁnite-dimensional normed space is not compact (see Exercise 4.2).

4.2
Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces
From now on we will consider compact operators on Hilbert spaces, even if certain
properties are valid in less structured spaces, like normed or Banach spaces.
4.2.1
General Properties and Examples
In the ﬁrst theorem about compact operators, the space’s completeness is necessary
only for the last statement.
Before, though, we need a preparatory proposition.
Proposition 4.14 Let H be a Hilbert space. Then A ∈B(H) is compact if and only
if |A| is compact (see Deﬁnition 3.80).
Proof Assume A is compact. Let {xk}k∈N be a bounded sequence in H and {Axkn}n∈N
a subsequence of {Axk}k∈N that converges, by virtue of compactness. Since the latter
is a Cauchy subsequence by (3.65), the subsequence {|A|xkn}n∈N of {|A|xk}k∈N is a
Cauchy sequence and converges. Hence |A| is compact. For the reverse implication
just swap A and |A| and repeat the argument.
⊓⊔

4.2 Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces
205
Theorem 4.15 Let H be a Hilbert space. The set of compact operators B∞(H) ⊂
B(H) is
(a) a linear subspace;
(b) a two-sided ∗-ideal: T K, K T, T ∗∈B∞(H) for any T ∈B∞(H), K ∈B(H);
(c) a C∗-subalgebra (without unit if dim H = ∞), as closed in the uniform topology.
Proof (a) We proved this, for general normed spaces, in Proposition 4.9(a).
(b) Proposition 4.9(b) shows that, in normed spaces, the left and right multiplica-
tions by a bounded operator preserve B∞(H). To show closure under Hermitian
conjugation, observe that |T | is compact iff T is compact, by Proposition 4.14. From
the polar decomposition T = U|T | of Theorem 3.82, we have T ∗= |T |U ∗, where
we used |T | ≥0, so |T | is self-adjoint. The boundedness of U ∗together with the
compactness of |T | force the product T ∗= |T |U ∗to be compact.
(c) This part follows directly from Proposition 4.9(c) and the deﬁnition of C∗-algebra
(recall H has inﬁnite dimension, so the identity I is not compact, for otherwise the
closed ball would be compact, and we know this cannot be).
⊓⊔
Remark 4.16 ThestatementoftheprevioustheoremcanbereversedifHisseparable,
as we have the following result due to Calkin (Cal41).
Theorem 4.17 If the Hilbert space H is separable, B∞(H) is the unique non-trivial
two-sided ∗-ideal of B(H) which is closed with respect to the uniform topology.
■
Examples 4.18 (1)IfX, Y arenormedspacesand T ∈B(X, Y)hasﬁnite-dimensional
ﬁnal space Ran(T ), then T must be compact. Let us prove it. If V ⊂X is bounded, i.e.
V ⊂Br(0) for some number r > 0, then ||T (V )|| ≤r||T|| < +∞, whence T (V )
is bounded. Therefore T (V ) is closed and bounded in a ﬁnite-dimensional normed
space homeomorphic to Cn (Proposition 2.107). By the Heine–Borel theorem T (V )
is compact in the topology induced on the range of T . Hence T is compact, because
compactness in the induced topology is the same as compactness in the ambient
space.
In particular, suppose H is a Hilbert space and consider the operator Tx ∈L(H):
Tx : u →(x|u)y ,
where x, y ∈H are given vectors (possibly equal). As it has ﬁnite-dimensional range,
Tx is compact.
(2) If {xn}n∈N and {yn}n∈N are orthogonal sets in H, and if T = 
n∈N(xn| )yn is a
bounded operator (interpreting the series in the uniform topology), then T is compact
by Theorem 4.15(a, c).
(3) Consider the operator A : {xn} →{xn+1/n} on ℓ2(N). It is compact because is
arises as uniform limit of:
Am : {xn} →{x2/1, x3/2, . . . , xm+1/m, 0, 0, . . .}

for n = 1, 2 . . . In fact, it is easy to prove (exercise)
||A −An|| ≤1/(n + 1) .
(4) Consider a measure μ on the σ-algebra Σ of X, and suppose μ is σ-ﬁnite, so
to deﬁne the product measure μ ⊗μ. We will use the simpler notation L2(μ) :=
L2(X, μ) and L2(μ ⊗μ) := L2(X × X, μ ⊗μ). Given K ∈L2(μ ⊗μ), we shall
prove that
TK : L2(μ) ∋f →

X
K(x, y) f (y)dμ(y)
deﬁnes a compact operator TK ∈B(L2(μ)) in case μ is separable (cf. Examples
3.32(3)). First of all, irrespective of separability, if f ∈L2(μ):

X
K(·, y) f (y)dμ(y) ∈L2(μ)
and



X
K(·, y) f (y)dμ(y)


L2(μ)
≤||K||L2(μ⊗μ)|| f ||L2(μ) ,
which is to say:
||TK|| ≤||K||L2(μ⊗μ) .
(4.2)
The proof of this is entirely based on the Fubini–Tonelli theorem: if K ∈L2(μ ⊗μ),
by Fubini–Tonelli we have:
(1) |K(x, ·)|2 ∈L1(μ), a.e. in μ,
(2)

X |K(·, y)|2dμ(y) ∈L1(μ) .
From (1) K(x, ·) ∈L2(μ) a.e., so K(x, ·) f ∈L1(μ) a.e. By the Cauchy–Schwarz
inequality:
(3)

X |K(x, y)|| f (y)|dμ(y) ≤||K(x, ·)||L2|| f ||L2.
Setting F(x) :=

X K(x, y) f (y)dμ(y), F is measurable, and by (3):
(4) |F(x)|2 ≤|| f ||2
L2

X |K(x, y)|2dμ(y).
From (2) we have |F|2 ∈L2(μ), so it is true that

X
K(·, y) f (y)dμ(y) ∈L2(μ) .

4.2 Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces

By (4) and Fubini–Tonelli, ﬁnally, we obtain


X
K(·, y) f (y)dμ(y)


L2(μ)
≤||K||L2(μ⊗μ)|| f ||L2(μ) ,
hence (4.2).
In order to show TK is compact, let us further assume μ is separable, so to make
L2(X, μ) separable (see Proposition 3.33). For instance, X could be an interval in R
(or a Borel set) and μ the Lebesgue measure on R. If {un}n∈N is a Hilbert basis of
L2(μ), {un · um}n,m∈N is a Hilbert basis of L2(μ ⊗μ) (· is the ordinary pointwise
product of functions). Then, in the topology of L2(μ ⊗μ), we have
K =

n,m
knmun · um ,
where the numbers knm ∈C depend on K. So, setting
K p :=

n,m≤p
knmun · um
we have K p →K as p →+∞in L2(μ ⊗μ). Applying (4.2) to TK p−K = TK p −
TK, where TK p is induced by the integral kernel K p, we have
||TK −TK p|| =



n,m>p
knmun · um


L2(μ⊗μ)
→0 ,
as p →+∞. Then TK is compact, because the operators TK p are compact, being
ﬁnite sums of operators with ﬁnite-dimensional ranges, like those of example (1)
above.
Even without assuming μ separable, and demanding instead K ∈L2(μ ⊗μ) and
μ σ-ﬁnite, it is easy to see that
TK = T ∗
K ,
(4.3)
where K(x, y) := K(x, y) for any x, y ∈X, and the bar is complex conjugation.
The proof follows from Proposition 3.36 and Fubini–Tonelli.

Spectral Decomposition of Compact Operators on
Hilbert Spaces
Compact operators on Hilbert spaces enjoy remarkable properties: concerning eigen-
vectors, eigenvalues and eigenspaces, in particular, the features of compact and self-

208

Families of Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces and Fundamental Properties
adjoint operators generalise to inﬁnite dimensions the properties of Hermitian matri-
ces. The ﬁrst two results clarify this matter.
Theorem 4.19 (Hilbert) Let H be a Hilbert space, T ∈B∞(H) an operator satis-
fying T = T ∗.
(a) Every λ-eigenspace of T , for λ ̸= 0, has ﬁnite dimension.
(b) The set σp(T ) of eigenvalues of T is:
(1) non-empty,
(2) real,
(3) at most countable;
(4) it has one limit point at most, and this is 0;
(5) it satisﬁes:
sup{|λ| | λ ∈σp(T )} = ||T|| .
More precisely, the least upper bound is Λ ∈σp(T ), where
Λ = ||T ||
if
sup||x||=1(x|T x) = ||T|| ,
(4.4)
or
Λ = −||T ||
if
inf||x||=1(x|T x) = −||T || .
(4.5)
(6) T coincides with the null operator if and only if 0 is the only eigenvalue.
Partial proof.
(a) Let Hλ be the λ-eigenspace of T , with λ ̸= 0. If B ⊂Hλ is the open unit ball at
the origin, we can write B = T (λ−1B), and λ−1B is bounded by construction. Since
T is compact, B is compact too. Hence in the Hilbert space Hλ the closure of the
open unit ball is compact, and so dim Hλ < +∞by Proposition 4.5. An alternate
proof immediately arises from Theorem 4.11(b).
(b) We will prove all items but (3) and (4), which will be part of the next theorem. If
σp(T ) is not empty it must consist of real numbers by (ii) in Proposition 3.60(c), T
being self-adjoint. Proposition 3.60(a) says that −||T || ≤(x|T x) ≤||T || for any unit
vector x, so only one of two possibilities can occur: either sup||x||=1(x|T x) = ||T|| or
inf||x||=1(x|T x) = −||T ||. Suppose the former is true, the other case being analogous
by ﬂipping the sign of T . Assume ||T || > 0, otherwise the theorem is trivial. For
any eigenvalue λ choose a unit λ-eigenvector x, so ||T|| ≥|(x|T x)| = |λ|(x|x) =
|λ|, and then sup |σp(T )| ≤||T ||. To prove (5) it sufﬁces to exhibit an eigenvector
with eigenvalue Λ = ||T ||. This also proves σp(T ) ̸= ∅by the way. By assumption
there is a sequence of unit vectors xn such that (xn|T xn) →||T || =: Λ > 0. Using
||T xn|| ≤||T||||xn|| = ||T ||, we have
||T xn −Λxn||2 = ||T xn||2 −2Λ(xn|T xn) + Λ2 ≤||T ||2 + Λ2 −2Λ(xn|T xn) .
As ||T || = Λ, taking the limit as n →+∞in the inequality gives
T xn −Λxn →0 .
(4.6)

4.2 Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces
209
To conclude it would be enough to show either that {xn}n∈N converges, or that a
subsequence does. As ||xn|| = 1, the sequence {xn}n∈N is bounded. But T is compact,
so we may extract from {T xn}n∈N a convergent subsequence {T xnk}k∈N.
Then (4.6) implies that
xnk = 1
Λ[T xnk −(T xnk −Λxnk)]
converges to some x ∈H, as k →+∞, for it is a linear combination of converging
sequences. Since T is continuous and xnk →x, formula (4.6) forces
T x = Λx .
Observe that x ̸= 0 because ||x|| = limk→+∞||xnk|| = 1. So we have shown x is a
Λ-eigenvector.
(6) is an immediate consequence of (5).
⊓⊔
Let us move on to the celebrated theorem of Hilbert on the expansion of self-
adjoint compact operators in terms of eigenvector bases.
Theorem 4.20 (Hilbert decomposition of compact operators) Let (H, ( | )) be a
Hilbert space and assume T ∈B∞(X), with eigenvalue set σp(T ), satisﬁes T = T ∗.
(a) If Pλ is the orthogonal projector onto the λ-eigenspace, then
T =

λ∈σp(T )
λPλ .
(4.7)
If σp(T ) is inﬁnite, series (4.7) is understood in uniform topology, and the eigenval-
ues: λ0, λ1, . . . (λi ̸= λ j, i ̸= j) are ordered so that |λ0| ≥|λ1| ≥|λ2| ≥. . ..
(b) If Bλ is a Hilbert basis of the λ-eigenspace, then ∪λ∈σp(T)Bλ is a Hilbert basis of
H. Equivalently, H admits a basis made of eigenvectors of T .
Remark 4.21 Notice that there can only be at most two distinct non-trivial eigenval-
ues with equal absolute value (the eigenvalues are real). As
|λ0| ≥|λ1| ≥|λ2| ≥. . . ,
the ambiguity in arranging the terms of the series regards pairs λ, λ′ with |λ| = |λ′|.
As we shall see after the proof, the sum of the series does not depend on this choice.■
Proof (including parts (3), (4) of Theorem 4.19). (a) Let λ be an eigenvalue with
eigenspace Hλ. Call Pλ the orthogonal projector onto Hλ and Qλ := I −Pλ the
orthogonal projector onto H⊥
λ . Then
T Pλ = PλT = λPλ .
(4.8)
In fact, if x ∈H, Pλx ∈Hλ then T Pλx = λPλx, so T Pλ = λPλ. Recalling that λ ∈
R, T = T ∗, Pλ = P∗
λ , by taking adjoints we ﬁnd PλT = λPλ = T Pλ. A further

210
4
Families of Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces and Fundamental Properties
consequence is, directly by deﬁnition of Qλ and the above, that
QλT = T Qλ .
(4.9)
Observe that from I = Pλ + Qλ we infer T = PλT + QλT , i.e.
T = λPλ + QλT .
(4.10)
The operator QλT :
(i) is self-adjoint, for (QλT )∗= T ∗Q∗
λ = T Qλ = QλT ,
(ii) is compact by Theorem 4.15(b),
(iii) satisﬁes, by construction, Pλ(QλT ) = (QλT )Pλ = 0 since PλQλ = QλPλ = 0.
In the rest of the proof these identities will be used without further mention, and
we shall write Pn, Qn, Hn instead of Pλn, Qλn, Hλn.
Let us begin by choosing an eigenvalue λ = λ0 with largest absolute value: there
are, at most, two such eigenvalues differing by a sign, and we pick either one. If
T1 := Q0T then
T = λ0P0 + T1
where T1 satisﬁes the above (i), (ii) and (iii). If T1 = 0 the proof ends; if not, we know
T1 is self-adjoint and compact, so we can iterate the procedure using T1 in place of
T and ﬁnd
T = λ0P0 + λ1P1 + T2
where T2 := Q1T1. Now λ1 is a non-null eigenvalue of T1 of largest absolute value
(if the largest eigenvalue were zero, then T1 = 0 by (6) in Theorem 4.19(b)). Fur-
thermore, P1 is the orthogonal projector onto the λ1-eigenspace of T1.
Observe that any eigenvalue λ1 of T1 is also an eigenvalue of T , because, if
T1u1 = λ1u1,
T u1 = (λ0P0 + T1)u1 = λ0P0T1
1
λ1
u1 + T1u1 = λ0P0Q0T 1
λ1
u1 + T1u1
= λ0 · 0 · T 1
λ1
u1 + λ1u1 = λ1u1 .
What is more, λ1 ̸= λ0 since u1 ∈RanT1 = Ran(Q0T ) ⊂H⊥
0 . At last, every λ1-
eigenvector of T is a λ1-eigenvector of T1. In fact, using T1 = Q0T = (I −P0)T
we have, with T u = λ1u,
T1u = λ1u −λ1P0u = λ1u + 0 = λ1u ,
also using P0u = 0 (because eigenspaces with distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal
for self-adjoint operators, like T ). Overall, the λ1-eigenspace H(T1)
1
coincides with the

4.2 Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces
211
λ1-eigenspace H1 of T . Therefore P1 is the orthogonal projector onto this common
eigenspace.
Since |λ0| is the maximum,
|λ1| ≤|λ0|.
There is an important consequence to this. Since ||T|| = |λ0| and ||T1|| = λ1 by the
previous theorem,
||T1|| ≤||T || .
If T2 = 0 the proof ends, otherwise we proceed as before, ﬁnding
T −
n

k=0
λk Pk = Tn ,
(4.11)
where
|λ0| ≥|λ1| ≥· · · ≥|λk| ≥. . .
and
||Tk|| = |λk|
(4.12)
If none of the Tk is null, the process never stops. In such a case we claim that
the decreasing sequence of positive numbers |λk| must tend to 0 (there cannot be a
positive limit point). Suppose |λ0| ≥|λ1| ≥· · · ≥|λk| ≥. . . ≥ε > 0 and pick a unit
vector xn ∈Hn for any n. The sequence of the xn is bounded, so the sequence of T xn,
or a subsequence of it, must converge as T is compact. But this is impossible: xn and
xm are perpendicular (their eigenvalues are distinct and the operator is self-adjoint,
cf. Proposition 3.60(b), part (ii)), so
||T xn −T xm||2 = ||λnxn −λmxm||2 = |λn|2 + |λm|2 ≥2ε ,
for any n, m. Therefore neither the T xn, nor any subsequence, can converge, for they
are not Cauchy sequences. This is a contradiction, so the sequence of the λn (if there
really are inﬁnitely many thereof) converges to 0. By (4.11) and (4.12), what we have
proved implies
T =
+∞

k=0
λk Pk
(4.13)
in the uniform topology. By construction, this result does not depend on how we
decide to order pairs of eigenvalues with equal absolute value. Now we claim that
(4.13) coincides with (4.7), because the sequence of eigenvalues {λk} exhausts σp(T )
except, possibly, for 0 (which at any rate interferes neither with (4.13) nor with (4.7)).

Families of Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces and Fundamental Properties
Let λ ̸= λn for any n be an eigenvalue of T , and Pλ its orthogonal projector. Given
that Pn Pλ = 0 for any n (again, by (ii) in Proposition 3.60(b)), (4.13) implies
TPλ =
+∞

k=0
λk Pk Pλ = 0 ,
whence, if u ∈Hλ,
T u = T Pλu = 0 .
This means λ = 0.
The proof of part (a) ends here, and in due course we have also justiﬁed the
leftovers of Theorem 4.19.
(b) The bases Bλ always exist by Theorem 3.27, eigenspaces being closed (exer-
cise) in H and hence Hilbert spaces themselves. Call B := ∪λ∈σp(T)Bλ the union. We
assert that if u ∈B⊥then u = 0; since B is orthonormal, by Deﬁnition 3.22 the proof
would end. Take then u ∈B⊥, so u ⊥Bλ for any λ ∈σp(T ), and hence Pλu = 0 for
any λ ∈σp(T ). Using decomposition (4.7) for T we ﬁnd T u = 0. Hence u belongs
to the 0-eigenspace H0. But u is orthogonal to every eigenspace of T by construction,
so u ∈H⊥
0 . This forces u = 0, as claimed.
⊓⊔
Hilbert’s theorem, together with the polar decomposition Theorem 3.82, allows to
generalise formula (4.7) to compact operators that are not self-adjoint. First, let us
see a deﬁnition useful for the sequel.
Deﬁnition 4.22 Let H be a Hilbert space and A ∈B∞(H). Non-zero eigenvalues λ
of |A| are called singular values of A, and their set is denoted by sing(A).
The (ﬁnite) dimension mλ of the eigenspace of λ ∈sing(A) is called multiplicity
of λ.
Theorem 4.23 Let (H, ( | )) be a Hilbert space and A ∈B∞(H), A ̸= 0. Suppose
sing(A) is non-empty and ordered as λ0 > λ1 > λ2 > . . . > 0. Then
A =

(4.15)
The sums, if inﬁnite, are meant in the uniform topology, and for any λ ∈sing(A) the
set of uλ,1, . . . , uλ,mλ is an orthonormal basis for the λ-eigenspace of |A|. Moreover,
for any λ ∈sing(A), i = 1, 2, . . . , mλ, the vectors
vλ,i := 1
λ Auλ,i

4.2 Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces

form an orthonormal system, and
vλ,i = Uuλ,i ,
(4.17)
where U is deﬁned by the polar decomposition A = U|A|.
Proof The operator |A| is self-adjoint, positive and compact. Its eigenvalues are real,
positive and satisfy conditions (a) and (b) in Theorem 4.19. We examine the case
where the eigenvalue set is inﬁnite (countable), leaving the ﬁnite case to the reader.
Theorem 4.20 allows to expand |A|:
|A| =

λ∈σp(|A|)
λPλ ,
where the convergence is uniform. It is clear we can reduce to non-zero eigenvalues
since 0 does contribute to the series, so
|A| =

λ∈sing(A)
λPλ .
If U is bounded and B(H) ∋Tn →T ∈B(H) uniformly, then UTn →UT in the
uniform topology. Since U (from A = U|A|) is bounded, in the uniform topology
we have:
A = U|A| =

λ∈sing(A)
λU Pλ .
(4.18)
Theorem 4.19(a) says the closed projection space of each Pλ (λ > 0) has ﬁnite
dimension mλ, so we may ﬁnd an orthonormal basis {uλ,i}i=1,...,mλ for it. Note
(uλ,i|uλ′, j) = δλλ′δi j by construction, as eigenvectors with distinct eigenvalues are
orthogonal (|A| is normal because positive) by virtue of (ii) in Proposition 3.60(b).
From uλ,i = |A|(uλ,i/λ) we have uλ,i ∈Ran(|A|). Therefore U acts on uλ,i isomet-
rically, and the vectors on the right in (4.17) are still orthonormal. Equation (4.17)
is equivalent to (4.16) by polar decomposition:
Auλ,i = U|A|uλ,i = Uλuλ,i = λvλ,i .
It is an easy exercise to show that the orthogonal projector Pλ (λ > 0) can be written
as
Pλ =
mλ

i=1
(uλ,i|
) uλ,i .
Consequently,
U Pλ =
mλ

i=1
(uλ,i|

mλ

i=1
(uλ,i|
) vλ,i .

Substituting in (4.18) gives (4.14). Equation (4.15) arises from (4.14) if we consider
the following two facts: (i) the conjugation A →A∗is antilinear (it transforms linear
combinations of operators into linear combinations of the adjoints with conjugated
coefﬁcients); (ii) conjugation is continuous in the uniform topology of B(H) because
Proposition 3.38(a) implies ||A∗|| = ||A||.
From these two facts, (4.14) gives (recall λ ∈R):
A∗=

λ∈sing(A)
mλ

i=1
λ [(uλ,i|
) vλ,i]∗,
where the series converges in the uniform topology. An easy exercise shows that
[(uλ,i|
) vλ,i]∗= (vλ,i|
) uλ,i ,
from which (4.15) is immediate.
⊓⊔
The theorem just proved allows us to introduce Hilbert–Schmidt operators and
operators of trace class, which we will describe in the ensuing sections.
4.3
Hilbert–Schmidt Operators
A particular class of compact operators is that of Hilbert–Schmidt operators. They
have several applications in wide-ranging areas of mathematical physics, besides
QM. This section is devoted to their study.
4.3.1
Main Properties and Examples
Warning. In this section, and sometimes also elsewhere, the operator norm || ||2 will
denote the Hilbert–Schmidt norm (see later) and not the usual L2 norm. This should
not be cause of ambiguity, for the correct meaning will be clear from the context. ■
Deﬁnition 4.24 Let (H, ( | )) be a Hilbert space and || || the inner product norm.
An operator A ∈B(H) is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator (HS) if there exists a basis
U such that 
u∈U ||Au||2 < +∞in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.19.
The class of Hilbert–Schmidt operators on H will be indicated with B2(H). If A ∈
B2(H),
||A||2 :=
	
u∈U
||Au||2 ,
(4.19)
where U is the chosen Hilbert basis.

4.3 Hilbert–Schmidt Operators
215
As ﬁrst thing let us prove that the choice of a particular Hilbert basis is not important,
and that ||A||2 does not depend on it.
Proposition 4.25 Let (H, ( | )) be a Hilbert space with norm || || induced by the
inner product, U and V bases (possibly coinciding) and A ∈B(H). Then:
(a) {||Au||2}u∈U has ﬁnite sum ⇔{||Av||2}v∈V has ﬁnite sum. In this case:

u∈U
||Au||2 =

v∈V
||Av||2 .
(4.20)
(b) {||Au||2}u∈U has ﬁnite sum ⇔{||A∗v||2}v∈V has ﬁnite sum. If so:

u∈U
||Au||2 =

v∈V
||A∗v||2 .
(4.21)
Proof In the light of Theorem 3.26(d),
||Au||2 =

v∈V
|(v|Au)|2 < +∞,
so, given u, only a countable number of coefﬁcients |(v|Au)|, at most, is non-zero
by Proposition 3.21(b). This gives at most a countable set V (u) ⊂V such that

u∈U
||Au||2 =

u∈U

v∈V (u)
|(v|Au)|2 < +∞.
(4.22)
In particular, using Proposition 3.21(b) again, it means that a countable (at most) set
of u ∈U gives non-zero sum 
v∈V (u) |(v|Au)|2. Therefore the coefﬁcients (v|Au)
do not vanish only for a countable (at most) set Z of pairs (u, v) ∈U × V . Deﬁne
sets (at most countable):
U0 := {u ∈U | there exists v ∈V with (v|Au) ̸= 0} ,
V0 := {v ∈V | there exists u ∈U with (v|Au) ̸= 0} .
Thus Z ⊂U0 × V0. Endow U0 and V0 with counting measures μ and ν, and write the
above series using integrals and these measures (Proposition 3.21(c)). In particular
(4.22) becomes:

u∈U
||Au||2 =

u∈U

v∈V (u)
|(v|Au)|2 =

U0
dμ(u)

V0
dν(v)|(v|Au)|2 < +∞.
(4.23)
As U0 and V0 are at most countable, μ and ν are σ-ﬁnite, so we can deﬁne the product
μ ⊗ν and use the Fubini–Tonelli theorem. Concerning the last part of (4.23), this

216
4
Families of Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces and Fundamental Properties
theorem ensures that (v, u) →|(v|Au)|2 is integrable in the product measure and we
can swap integrals:

u∈U
||Au||2 =

U0×V0
|(v|Au)|2dμ(u) ⊗dν(v) =

V0
dν(v)

U0
dμ(u)|(v|Au)|2 < +∞.
Note (v|Au) = (A∗v|u), so just countably many, at most, products (A∗v|u) (with
(u, v) ∈U × V ) will be different from zero, and in particular:

v∈V

u∈U
|(A∗v|u)|2 =

V0
dν(v)

U0
dμ(u)|(A∗v|u)|2 =

u∈U
||Au||2 < +∞.
But the left-hand side is precisely 
v∈V ||A∗v||2. Therefore we have proved the
following part of assertion (b): if {||Au||2}u∈U has ﬁnite sum, so does{||A∗v||2}v∈V ,
and the sums coincide. Recalling that (A∗)∗= A for bounded operators, we can now
use the same proof, just exchanging the bases and starting from A∗, to prove the
remaining part of (b): if {||A∗v||2}v∈V has ﬁnite sum, then also {||Au||2}u∈U does,
and then (4.21) holds.
The proof of (a) is straightforward from (b) because the bases used are arbitrary.
⊓⊔
With that settled we can discuss some of the many and interesting mathematical
properties of HS operators. The most fascinating from a mathematical viewpoint
is stated as (b) in the next theorem: HS operators A form a Hilbert space whose
inner product induces precisely the norm we called ||A||2. Another important fact
is that HS operators are compact, and their space is a ∗-closed ideal inside bounded
operators.
Theorem 4.26 Hilbert–Schmidt operators on a Hilbert space H enjoy the following
properties.
(a) B2(H) is a subspace in B(H) and, actually, a two-sided ∗-ideal in B(H); more-
over:
(i) ||A||2 = ||A∗||2 for any A ∈B2(H);
(ii) ||AB||2 ≤||B|| ||A||2 and ||B A||2 ≤||B|| ||A||2 for any A ∈B2(H), B ∈
B(H);
(iii) ||A|| ≤||A||2 for any A ∈B2(H).
(b) If A, B ∈B2(H) and if N is a basis in H, deﬁne:
(A|B)2 :=

x∈N
(Ax|Bx) .
(4.24)
The map
( | )2 : B2(H) × B2(H) →C

is well deﬁned (the sum always reduces to an absolutely convergent series and does
not depend on the basis) and determines an inner product on B2(H) such that:
(A|A)2 = ||A||2
2
(4.25)
for any A ∈B2(H).
(c) (B2(H), ( | )2) is a Hilbert space.
(d) B2(H) ⊂B∞(H). More precisely, A ∈B2(H) if and only if A is compact and
the set of positive numbers {mλλ2}λ∈sing(A) (mλ is the multiplicity of λ) has ﬁnite
sum. In this case:
||A||2 =
	

λ∈sing(A)
mλλ2 .
(4.26)
Proof (a) Obviously B2(H) is closed under multiplication by a scalar. Let us show
it is closed under sums. If A, B ∈B2(H) and N is any Hilbert basis:

u∈N
||(A + B)u||2 ≤

u∈N
(||Au|| + ||Bu||)2 ≤2


u∈N
||Au||2 +

u∈N
||Bu||2

.
Thus B2(H) is a subspace in B(H). A consequence of Proposition 4.25(b) is the
closure under Hermitian conjugation, which proves (i). We prove (ii) and at the same
time that B2(H) is closed under left and right composition with bounded operators.
If A ∈B2(H) and B ∈B(H):

u∈N
||B Au||2 ≤

u∈N
||B||2||Au||2 = ||B||2 
u∈N
||Au||2 .
This shows B2(H) is closed under composition on the left, and also the second
inequality in (ii). Closure under right composition follows from closure under
Hermitian conjugation and left composites: B∗A∗∈B2(H) if A ∈B2(H) and
B ∈B(H), so (B∗A∗)∗∈B2(H), i.e. AB ∈B2(H). From (i) we ﬁnd that if A ∈
B2(H) and B ∈B(H), then ||AB||2 = ||(AB)∗||2 = ||B∗A∗||2 ≤||B∗|| ||A∗||2 =
||B|| ||A||2, ﬁnishing part (ii). As for (iii) observe:
||A|| = sup

||Ax|| = sup

= ||A∗||2 = ||A||2 .
(b) If A, B ∈B2(H) and N is a Hilbert basis, the number of non-zero terms Au
and Bu, for u ∈N, is at most countable by Deﬁnition 4.24 and Proposition 3.21(b).
Since
|(Au|Bu)| ≤||Au|| ||Bu|| ≤1
2(||Au||2 + ||Bu||2) ,
the number of non-vanishing products (Au|Bu), u ∈N, is alsocountableat most, and
the series of non-null terms (Au|Bu) is absolutely convergent, so the term ordering
in (4.24) is irrelevant. In a moment we will show that the choice of Hilbert basis is
not important. First, though, notice that (4.25) holds trivially and ( | )2 satisﬁes the
axioms of a semi-inner product, as is easy to check. Positive deﬁniteness (axiom H3)
follows directly from (iii), so ( | )2 is an inner product inducing || ||2. Therefore we
have polarisation, for this formula holds for any inner product:
4(A|B)2 = ||A + B||2
2 + ||A −B||2
2 −i||A + i B||2
2 + i||A −i B||2
2 .
Since, by Proposition 4.25, the number on the right does not depend on any Hilbert
basis, neither will the left-hand side.
(c) We need only prove the space is complete. Take a Hilbert basis N of H and {An}n∈N
a Cauchy sequence of HS operators with respect to || ||2. From part (iii) in (a), that
is a Cauchy sequence also in the uniform topology, and since B(H) is complete by
Theorem 2.44, there will be A ∈B(H) with ||A −An|| →0 as n →+∞. Cauchy’s
property asserts that however we take ε > 0 there is Nε such that ||An −Am||2
2 ≤ε2
if n, m > Nε. By deﬁnition of || ||2, for the same ε we will also have that for any
ﬁnite subset I ⊂N:

u∈I
||(An −Am)u||2 ≤||An −Am||2
2 ≤ε2
whenever n, m > Nε. Passing to the limit as m →+∞, we ﬁnd

u∈I
||(An −A)u||2 ≤ε2 ,
for any ﬁnite I ⊂N if n > Nε. Overall, given that I is arbitrary,
||A −An||2 ≤ε
if n > Nε .
(4.27)
In particular, then, A −An ∈B2(H), and so:
A = An + (A −An) ∈B2(H) .

4.3 Hilbert–Schmidt Operators
219
Furthermore, also ε > 0 was arbitrary in (4.27), so An tends to A in norm || ||2.
Therefore every Cauchy sequence for || ||2 converges inside B2(H), making the
latter complete.
(d) Let A ∈B2(H): we claim it is compact and fulﬁls (4.26). Take a Hilbert basis
N. Then 
u∈N ||Au||2 < +∞, where at most countably many summands do not
vanish, and the sum can be written as series, or ﬁnite sum, by taking only the un for
which ||Aun||2 > 0. Therefore, for any ε > 0 there exists Nε such that
+∞

n=Nε
||Aun||2 ≤ε2 .
The same property can be expressed in terms of N: for any ε > 0 there is a ﬁnite
subset Iε ⊂N such that

u∈N\Iε
||Au||2 ≤ε2 .
Let then AIε be the operator deﬁned by AIεu := Au if u ∈Iε and AIεu := 0 if u ∈
N \ Iε. The range of AIε is spanned by the Au with u ∈Iε, because these are ﬁnite
in number, and AIε is bounded and compact (Example 4.18(1)). By construction
||A −AIε||2 exists, and:
||A −AIε||2
2 =

u∈N
||(A −AIε)u||2 =

u∈N\Iε
||Au||2 .
By part (iii) in (a), therefore,
||A −AIε|| ≤||A −AIε||2 =
⎛
⎝
u∈N\Iε
||Au||2
⎞
⎠
1/2
≤ε .
Hence A is a limit point in the space of compact operators in the uniform topology. As
the ideal of compact operators is uniformly closed (Theorem 4.15(c)), A is compact.
Now let us prove (4.26). Consider the positive compact operator |A| =
√
A∗A and
let {uλ,i}λ∈sing(A),i={1,2,...,mλ} be a Hilbert basis of Ker(|A|)⊥, built as in Theorem
4.23. We may complete it to a basis of the Hilbert space by adding a basis for
Ker(|A|), and Ker(|A|) = Ker(A) by Remark 3.81. (Using the orthogonal splitting
H = Ker(|A|) ⊕Ker(|A|)⊥, if {ui} is a basis for the closed subspace Ker(|A|) and
{v j} a basis for the closed Ker(|A|)⊥, the orthonormal system N := {ui} ∪{v j} is
a basis of H, since x ∈H orthogonal to N implies x = 0.) Using that basis to write
||A||2:
||A||2

where the basis of Ker(A), by construction, does not contribute, |A|uλ,i =
√
A∗Auλ,i = λuλ,i and (uλ,i|uλ′, j) = δλλ′δi j.
If, conversely, A is compact and {mλλ2}λ∈sing(A) has ﬁnite sum, then (4.28) implies
||A||2 < +∞, so A ∈B2(H).
⊓⊔
Examples 4.27 (1) Let us go back to example (4) in (4.18). Consider the operators:
TK : L2(X, μ) →L2(X, μ)
induced by integral kernels K ∈L2(X × X, μ ⊗μ)
(TK f )(x) :=

X
K(x, y) f (y)dμ(y)
for any f ∈L2(X, μ)
(μ is a σ-ﬁnite separable measure). We did prove earlier that these operators are
compact. Now we show they are Hilbert–Schmidt operators.
Using the same deﬁnition of the example mentioned above, if f ∈L2(X, μ) we
saw (cf. part (3) in Example 4.18(4)) that for any x ∈X
F(x) =

X
|K(x, y)| | f (y)|dμ(y) < +∞.
Since F ∈L2(X, μ), for any g ∈L2(X, μ) the map x →g(x)F(x) is integrable (so
we can deﬁne the inner product of g and F). The Fubini–Tonelli theorem guarantees
the map (x, y) →g(x)K(x, y) f (y) is in L2(X × X, μ ⊗μ) and that

X×X
g(x)K(x, y) f (y) dμ(x) ⊗dμ(y) =

X
dμ(x) g(x)

X
K(x, y) f (y)dμ(y) = (g|Tk f ) .
(4.29)
So let us consider a basis of L2(X × X, μ ⊗μ) of type {ui · u j}i, j, where {uk}k is a
basis for L2(X, μ) (and so is {uk}k, as is easy to prove). As K ∈L2(X × X, μ ⊗μ),
we have an expansion:
K =

i, j
αi jui · u j ,
(4.30)
and then
||K||2
L2 =

i, j
|αi j|2 < +∞.
(4.31)
On the other hand, (4.29) and (4.30) imply
(ui|TKu j) =

X×X
ui(x)u j(y)K(x, y) dμ(x) ⊗dμ(y) = (ui · u j|K) = αi j ,

4.3 Hilbert–Schmidt Operators
221
hence (4.31) rephrases as:
||K||2
L2 =

i, j
|(ui|TKu j)|2 < +∞.
By deﬁnition TK is therefore a Hilbert–Schmidt operator, and
||TK||2 = ||K||L2
(4.32)
(2)ItisnotsohardtoprovethatifH = L2(X, μ)withμseparableandσ-ﬁnite,B2(H)
consists precisely of the operators TK with K ∈L2(X × X, μ ⊗μ), so that the map
identifying K with TK is a Hilbert space isomorphism between L2(X × X, μ ⊗μ)
and B2(H). To see this, we take T ∈B2(H) and shall exhibit K ∈L2(X × X, μ ⊗μ)
for which T = TK. Given any basis {un}n∈N of L2(X, μ) we have 
n∈N ||T un||2 <
+∞. Consequently, by expanding T un in {un}n∈N we obtain:
+∞>

n∈N
||T un||2 =

m∈N

n∈N
|(um|T un)|2 .
Interpreting the series as integrals on {un}n∈N, and applying Fubini–Tonelli, we con-
clude 
(n,m)∈N2 |(um|T un)|2 < +∞, so the HS operator TK with integral kernel:
K :=

(n,m)∈N2
(um|T un)um · un ∈L2(X × X, μ ⊗μ)
is well deﬁned. At the same time, the results of the previous example tell that, by
construction:
(um|TKun) =

X
dμ(x)um(x)

X
dμ(y)K(x, y)un(y) = (um|T un)
and so TKun = T un for any n ∈N. By continuity TK = T follows immediately.
(3) Consider the Volterra equation in the unknown function f ∈L2([0, 1], dx):
f (x) = ρ
 x
0
f (y)dy + g(x) ,
with given g ∈L2([0, 1], dx) and ρ ∈C \ {0}.
(4.33)
Above, dx is the Lebesgue measure, and the integral exists because, for any given x ∈
[0, 1], we can view it as the inner product of f and the map [0, 1] ∋y →θ(x −y):
 x
0
f (y)dy =
 1
0
θ(x −y) f (y)dy ,

222

Families of Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces and Fundamental Properties
where θ(u) = 1 if u ≥0 and θ(u) = 0 if u < 0. Clearly (x, y) →θ(x −y) is also
in L2([0, 1]2, dx ⊗dy), so the equation can be rephrased using a Hilbert–Schmidt
operator T :
f = ρT f + g ,
with given g ∈L2([0, 1], dx) and ρ ∈C \ {0}
(4.34)
where we deﬁned the Volterra operator:
(Tg)(x) :=
 x
0
g(y)dy
g ∈L2([0, 1], dx) .
(4.35)
Volterra operators, and the associated equations, are more generally deﬁned as:
(TV f )(x) :=
 x
0
V (x, y)g(y)dy ,
for some suitably regular V : [0, 1]2 →R. We will study the simplest situation, given
by (4.35). If the operator (I −ρT ) is invertible, the solution to (4.34) reads:
f = (I −ρT )−1g .
(4.36)
Formally, using the geometric series we see that the (left and right) inverse to I −ρT
is:
(I −ρT )−1 = I +
+∞

n=0
ρn+1T n+1 ,
(4.37)
where the convergence is in the uniform topology. A sufﬁcient condition for con-
vergence is ||ρT || < 1, proved in analogy to the geometric series. Yet we will look
for a ﬁner estimate. Use the norm of B2(L2([0, 1], dx)) and recall part (iii) in The-
orem 4.26(a). Moreover, if ||An|| ≤an ≥0 for any An ∈B(L2([0, 1], dx)) where
+∞
n=0 an converges, then also +∞
n=0 An converges in B(L2([0, 1], dx)). The proof
of the latter fact is similar to that of Weierstrass’s ‘M-test’ in elementary calculus. A
direct computation with (4.35) shows that if n ≥1:
(T n+1g)(x) =
 x
0
(x −y)n
n!
g(y)dy ,
so T n ∈B2(L2([0, 1], dx)) and:
||T n|| ≤||T n||2 =

Since the series with general term ρn2n

converges, for any ρ ̸= 0 the operator (I −
ρT )−1 exists in B(L2([0, 1], dx)) and is given by sum (4.37). Therefore (4.36) solves
the initial Volterra equation. It is possible to make (I −ρT )−1 explicit

For these operations we used a notion of pointwise convergence that is different
from the uniform operator convergence. That the above expression is indeed the
explicit inverse to I −ρT can be checked by a direct computation, using (4.35) and
integrating by parts with g ∈C([0, 1]). The result extends to L2([0, 1], dx) because
the operator with integral kernel θ(x −y)eρ(x−y) is bounded (HS), and C([0, 1]) is
dense in L2([0, 1], dx). The inverse’s uniqueness concludes the proof.

the latter’s norm topology.

and the convergence is in L2(X × X, μ ⊗μ).
The map L2(X × X, μ ⊗μ) ∋K →TK ∈B2(L2(X, μ)) is an isomorphism of
Hilbert spaces.
Mercer’stheorem(RiNa53)canbeusefulwhenwedealwithacompactspaceX ⊂Rn
with Lebesgue’s measure μ. In such a case, if K is continuous and TK is positive,
the convergence of (4.39) is in || ||∞, provided one uses a basis of eigenvectors for
TK. We state and prove the theorem in a slightly more general setup, so to cover
Lebesgue measures on compact sets in Rn.
Theorem 4.29 (Mercer) Let μ be a positive, separable Borel measure on a compact
Hausdorff space X such that μ(X) < +∞and μ(A) > 0 for any open set A ̸= ∅.
Assume K : X × X →C is a continuous function.
If TK in (4.38) is positive, i.e. ( f |TK f ) ≥0 for f ∈L2(X, μ), then
K(x, y) =

(4.40)
where the series converges on X × X in norm || ||∞. The number mλ indicates the
dimension (ﬁnite if λ ̸= 0) of the λ-eigenspace of TK, and {uλ,i}λ∈σp(Tk),i=1,...,mλ is a
Hilbert basis of eigenvectors (continuous if λ ̸= 0) of TK.
Proof For simplicity let us relabel eigenvectors as u j with j ∈N, and call λ j the cor-
responding eigenvalues (it may happen that λ j = λk if j ̸= k). To begin with, notice
the eigenvectors with λ ̸= 0 are continuous, by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality:
|u j(x) −u j(x′)|2 ≤

X
|K(x, y) −K(x′, y)|2dμ(y)

X
|u j(y)|2dμ(y) →0
as x →x′.
Weuseddominatedconvergencefortheﬁrstintegralontheright,since K isintegrable
on X, as μ(X) is ﬁnite, and also continuous on the compact set X × X and hence
|K(x, ·) −K(x′, ·)|2 is bounded, uniformly in x, x′, by some constant map C ≥0.
So take the continuous maps

where the last series converges in L2(X × X, μ(x) ⊗μ(y)) by Theorem 4.28. Note
λ j ≥0, because 0 ≤(u j|TKu j) = λ j. In the topology of L2(X × X, μ(x) ⊗μ(y))
we have:
Kn(x, y) =

We claim that this fact implies Kn(x, x) ≥0. If there were x0 ∈X with Kn(x0, x0) <
0, as Kn is continuous we would be able to ﬁnd an open neighbourhood (x0, x0) where
Kn(x, y) ≤Kn(x0, x0) + ε < 0. Since X × X has the product topology, we could
choose the neighbourhood to be Bx0 × Bx0 where Bx0 is an open neighbourhood of
x0. By Urysohn’s lemma (Theorem 1.24) we could ﬁnd a continuous map f with
support in Bx0 such that 0 ≤f ≤1 and f (x0) = 1 ({x0} is compact because closed
inside a compact space). Then a contradiction would ensue, since μ(Bx0) > 0 by
assumption:

by virtue of the above series’ uniform convergence on X (of ﬁnite measure). But we
also know the series on the right converges to TK f in L2(X, dμ(x)): we claim it
converges to (TK f )(x) also pointwise at x. Since K is continuous on X (compact
and of ﬁnite measure), an obvious consequence of dominated convergence shows
X ∋x →

X |K(x, y)|2dμ(y) is continuous, so a constant C exists such that:

X
|K(x, y)|2dμ(y) < C2
for any x ∈X .
Hence if fn →f in L2(X, μ), then TK fn →TK f in norm || ||∞:

f (x) =


j=0
u j(x)

X
u j(y) f (y)dμ(y),
we obtain a convergent expansion in L2(X, dμ(x)). Applying TK must give a uni-
formly converging series at x ∈X. Therefore the last series in (4.41) converges
pointwise (and uniformly) to (TK f )(x) for any x ∈X. Comparing with the left-hand
side of (4.41) and recalling that (TK f )(x) =

K(x, y) f (y)dμ(y) we ﬁnally get

X
(B(x, y) −K(x, y)) f (y)dμ(y) = 0 .
Choosing f (y) := B(x, y) −K(x, y), for any given x ∈X, allows to conclude
B(x, y) = K(x, y) by using Proposition 1.71 suitably. So
K(x, x) = B(x, x) =

4.3 Hilbert–Schmidt Operators
227
The terms are continuous, non-negative and the sum is a continuous map, so Dini’s
Theorem 2.20 forces uniform convergence. From Cauchy–Schwarz we deduce that
+∞
j=0 λ ju j(x)u j(y) converges uniformly, jointly in x, y, to some K ′(x, y). But
X × X has ﬁnite measure, so the convergence is in L2(X × X, μ ⊗μ). Since we
know the series converges to K(x, y) in that topology, then it converges uniformly
to K(x, y) and the proof ends.
⊓⊔
Remark 4.30 The theorem is still valid if TK has a ﬁnite number of negative eigen-
values, as is easy to prove.

4.4
Trace-Class (or Nuclear) Operators
In this part we introduce operators of trace class, also known as nuclear operators.
We shall follow the approach of (Mar82) essentially (a different perspective is found
in (Pru81)).
4.4.1
General Properties
Proposition 4.31 Let H be a Hilbert space and A ∈B(H). The following three facts
are equivalent.
(a) There exists a Hilbert basis N of H such that {(u||A|u)}u∈N has ﬁnite sum:

u∈N
(u||A|u) < +∞.
(a)’ √|A| is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator.
(b) A is compact and the indexed set {mλλ}λ∈sing(A), where mλ is the multiplicity of
λ, has ﬁnite sum.
Proof Statement (a)’ is a mere translation of (a), for √|A|√|A| = |A|, so (a) and
(a)’ are equivalent.
Wewillshow(a)⇒(b).RecallthatanyHSoperator,inparticular√|A|,iscompact
(Theorem 4.26(d)); secondly, the product of compact operators, e.g. |A| = (√|A|)2,
is compact (Theorem 4.15(b)); at last, |A| = (√|A|)2 is compact iff A is compact
(Proposition 4.14). As a consequence of all this, A is compact. Let us take a basis
of H made of eigenvectors of |A|: uλ,i, i = 1, . . . , mλ (mλ = +∞possibly, only for
λ = 0) and |A|uλ,i = λuλ,i. In such basis:

⊓⊔
Deﬁnition 4.32 Let H be a Hilbert space. The operator A ∈B(H) is said to be of
trace class, or a nuclear operator, if it satisﬁes either of (a), (a)’ or (b) in Proposition
4.31. The set of trace-class operators on H will be denoted by B1(H). In the notation
of Proposition 4.31, if A ∈B1(H),
||A||1 :=



|A|


2
2 =

λ∈sing(A)
mλλ .
(4.42)
Remark 4.33 (1) The name “trace class” has its origin in the following observation.
For an operator A of trace class, the real number ||A||1 generalises to inﬁnite dimen-
sions the notion of trace of the matrix corresponding to |A| (not A). As a matter of
fact, the analogies do not end here, as we shall soon see.
(2) The following inclusions hold:
B1(H) ⊂B2(H) ⊂B∞(H) ⊂B(H) .
The only relation we have not yet proved is the ﬁrst one. To this end, if A ∈B1(H),
by deﬁnition √|A| ∈B2(H), so |A| = √|A|√|A| is HS by Theorem 4.26(a). From
the polar decomposition A = U|A|, U ∈B(H), we have A ∈B2(H) by Theorem
4.26(a).
(3) Each of the above sets is a subspace in the vector space of bounded operators,
and also a two-sided ∗-ideal (for trace-class operators we will prove it in a moment).
Furthermore, each has a natural Hilbert or Banach structure: compact operators are
closed in B(H) in the uniform topology, so they form a Banach space for the operator
norm; HS operators form a Hilbert space with the Hilbert–Schmidt inner product;
trace-class operators form a Banach space with norm || ||1, as we will explain later.
■
Before we extend the notion of trace to the inﬁnite-dimensional case, let us review
the key features of nuclear operators.
Theorem 4.34 Let H be a Hilbert space. Nuclear operators on H enjoy the follow-
ing properties.
(a) If A ∈B1(H) there exist two operators B, C ∈B2(H) such that A = BC. Con-
versely, if B, C ∈B2(H) then BC ∈B1(H) and:
||BC||1 ≤||B||2 ||C||2 .
(4.43)

4.4 Trace-Class (or Nuclear) Operators
229
(b) B1(H) is a subspace of B(H), and actually a two-sided ∗-ideal. Moreover:
(i) ||AB||1 ≤||B|| ||A||1 and ||B A||1 ≤||B|| ||A||1 for any A ∈B1(H) and B ∈
B(H);
(ii) ||A||1 = ||A∗||1 for any A ∈B1(H);
(c) || ||1 is a norm on B1(H).
Remark 4.35 It can be proved (B1(H), || ||1) is a Banach space (Sch60, BiSo87).■
Proof of Theorem4.34 (part (b)(ii) is deferred to Proposition4.38). (a) If A is of
trace class, the polar decomposition A = U|A| tells B and C can be taken to be
B := U√|A| and C := √|A|. By deﬁnition of trace-class operator √|A| is a Hilbert–
Schmidt operator, so C is, too. Also B is HS, for U ∈B(H) and B2(H) is a two-sided
ideal in B(H), by Theorem 4.26. Let now B, C be HS operators, and let us show
A := BC is of trace class. By Theorems 4.26(d) and 4.15(b) A is compact. Hence we
need only show 
λ∈sing(A) mλλ < +∞. If BC = 0, the claim is obvious. Assume
BC ̸= 0 and expand the compact operator BC after Theorem 4.23:
A = BC =

λ∈sing(A)
mλ

i=1
λ(uλ,i| )vλ,i .
Lest the notation become too heavy, set
Γ := {(λ, i)|λ ∈sing(A), i = 1, 2, . . . , mλ}
and suppose λ j is the ﬁrst element in the pair j = (λ, i). Then, clearly,

j∈Γ
λ j =

λ∈singA
mλλ .
From the polar decomposition theorem A = U|A|, with U ∗U = I on the range of
|A|. Since v j = Uu j implies U ∗v j = u j, we have:
(v j|BCu j) = (v j|Au j) = (v j|U|A|u j) = λ j(v j|Uu j) = λ j(U ∗v j|u j) = λ j(u j|u j) = λ j .
If S ⊂Γ is ﬁnite:

As the orthonormal systems u j = uλ,i and v j = vλ,i can be both completed to give
bases of H, the ﬁnal term in the chain of inequalities above is smaller than

Taking the supremum over all ﬁnite sets S we conclude

and in particular A = BC ∈B1(H).

itself. Let us show B1(H) is closed under sums. Take A, B ∈B1(H). If A + B = 0,
A + B is clearly nuclear. So assume A + B ̸= 0 (compact anyway) and write polar
decompositions: A = U|A|, B = V |B|, A + B = W|A + B|. Use the familiar sum
over singular values, like we did in (a), to ﬁnd:
A + B =

β∈sing(A+B)
mβ

i=1
β(uβ,i| )vβ,i .
Set Γ := {(β, i)|β ∈sing(A + B), i = 1, 2, . . . , mβ}, take S ⊂Γ ﬁnite and let β j
be the ﬁrst element in the pair j ∈Γ . Then:

j∈S
β j =

j∈S
(v j|(A + B)u j) =

j∈S
(v j|Au j) +

j∈S
(v j|Bu j) .
We can rewrite this as follows:

|A|u j) +

Proceeding as in (a) gives:

(in the ﬁnal passage we use the inequality ||√|A|U ∗||2 ≤||√|A|||2 ||U ∗|| (part (ii)
in Theorem 4.26(a)), since √|A| is Hilbert–Schmidt. Furthermore, it is easy to see
||U ∗|| ≤1, because U ∗is isometric on Ker(|A|)⊥and vanishes on Ker(|A|)).
Eventually note:

|A|||2

So we have proved A + B ∈B1(H) and that the triangle inequality

4.4 Trace-Class (or Nuclear) Operators

holds on B1(H). This turns || ||1 into a seminorm. It is indeed a norm, for ||A||1 = 0
implies the eigenvalues of |A| are all zero. By compactness |A| = 0, from (b) in
Theorem 4.19(6). The polar decomposition of A = U|A| forces A = 0. At this stage
we have proved B1(H) is a subspace of B(H) and || ||1 is a norm. Let us show
that B1(H) is closed under composition with bounded operators on either side.
Take A ∈B1(H), B ∈B(H) and write A = U|A|. Then B A = (BU√|A|) √|A|,
where the two factors are HS operators, so B A ∈B1(H) by part (a). Using Theorem
4.26(a)(ii), Eq.(4.42) and part (a):
||B A||1 ≤||BU

|A|||2 ≤||BU|| ||

2 = ||B|| ||A||1 .
Moreover AB = (U√|A|) √|A|B ∈B1(H) because both factors are HS and (a)
holds. In a manner similar to part (a) one proves ||AB||1 ≤||B|| ||A||1. Statement
(ii) in part (b) will be justiﬁed in the proof of Proposition 4.38.
⊓⊔
4.4.2
The Notion of Trace
To conclude we introduce the notion of trace of a nuclear operator, and we show how
it has the same formal properties of the trace of a matrix.
Proposition 4.36 If (H, ( | )) is a Hilbert space, A ∈B1(H) and N is a basis of H,
then
tr A :=

u∈N
(u|Au)
(4.44)
is well deﬁned, since the series on the right is ﬁnite or absolutely convergent. More-
over:
(a) tr A does not depend on the chosen Hilbert basis;
(b) for any pair (B, C) of Hilbert–Schmidt operators such that A = BC:
tr A = (B∗|C)2 ;
(4.45)
(c) |A| ∈B1(H) and:
||A||1 = tr|A| ;
(4.46)
(d) |tr A| ≤tr|A|, so that tr : B1(H) →C is continuous with respect to || ||1.
Proof (a)–(b). Any trace-class operator can be decomposed in the product of two
HS operators as we saw in Theorem 4.34(a). We begin by noticing that if A = BC,
with B, C Hilbert–Schmidt, then
(B∗|C)2 =

u∈N
(B∗u|Cu) =

u∈N
(u|BCu) =

u∈N
(u|Au) = tr A .

232
4
Families of Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces and Fundamental Properties
This justiﬁes (4.45) but also explains that tr A is well deﬁned, being a Hilbert–
Schmidt inner product. Moreover, it says that in the inﬁnite sum (4.44) only countably
many summands, at most, are non-zero, and that the sum reduces to a ﬁnite sum or to
an absolutely convergent series, since 
u∈N |(B∗u|Cu)| < +∞by deﬁnition of HS
inner product. (It also shows (B∗|C)2 = (B′∗|C′)2 if BC = B′C′, for B, B′, C, C′
are HS operators.) The result eventually proves the invariance of tr A under changes
of basis, because ( | )2 does not depend on the chosen Hilbert basis.
(c) Firstly, by uniqueness of the square root, | (|A|) | = |A|. In fact | (|A|) | is the
only positive bounded operator whose square is |A|∗|A| = |A|2, and |A| is bounded,
positive and squaring to |A|2. As A is of trace class:
+∞>

u∈N
(u||A|u) =

u∈N
(u|| (|A|) |u) ,
so Deﬁnition 4.32 implies |A| itself is of trace class. Choosing a basis {uλ,i} of
eigenvectors for |A| we have:
tr|A| =

λ∈sing(A)
mλ

i=1
(uλ,i| |A|uλ,i) =

λ∈sing(A)
mλ

i=1
λ =

λ∈sing(A)
mλλ = ||A||1 .
Eventually, (d) is easy: to compute tr A we use again a basis N of eigenvectors u of
|A| and exploit the polar decomposition of A = U|A|.
|tr A| ≤

λ∈sing(A)
mλ

i=1
|(uλ,i| U|A|uλ,i)| =

λ∈sing(A)
mλ

i=1
λ|(uλ,i|Uuλ,i)| ≤

λ = tr|A| .
Hence the proof ends.
⊓⊔
Deﬁnition 4.37 Let H be a Hilbert space and A ∈B1(H). The number tr A ∈C is
called the trace of the operator A.
The next proposition summarises other useful properties of nuclear operators on
Hilbert spaces: in particular – and precisely as in the ﬁnite-dimensional case – the
trace is invariant under cyclic permutations. We remark that the operators of the
statements below need not necessarily be all of trace class (an important fact in
physical applications).
Proposition 4.38 Let H be a Hilbert space. The trace enjoys the following proper-
ties.
(a) If A, B ∈B1(H) and α, β ∈C, then:
tr A∗= tr A ,
(4.47)
tr(αA + βB) = α tr A + β tr B .
(4.48)

4.4 Trace-Class (or Nuclear) Operators
233
(b) If A is of trace class and B ∈B(H), or A and B are both HS operators, then
tr AB = tr B A .
(4.49)
(c) Let A1, A2, . . . An be in B(H). If one is of trace class, or two are HS operators,
then the trace is invariant under cyclic permutations:
tr (A1A2 · · · An) = tr (Aσ(1)Aσ(2) · · · Aσ(n)) ,
(4.50)
where (σ(1), σ(2), . . . , σ(n)) is a cyclic permutation of (1, 2, . . . , n).
(d) If A ∈B1(H) then:
||A|| ≤||A||2 =

tr(|A|2) ≤tr|A| = ||A||1 .
Proof of proposition 4.38 and of part (ii) in Theorem 4.34(b).
(a) Immediate by deﬁnition of trace.
(b) Let us begin by proving the statement if A and B are both HS operators. By
Theorem 4.26(b), Eq.(4.49) is equivalent to
(A∗|B)2 = (B∗|A)2 .
(4.51)
The proof of (4.51) is straightforward using the polarisation formula (valid for any
inner product and the induced norm)
4(X|Y) = ||X + Y||2 + ||X −Y||2 −i||X + iY||2 + i||X −iY||2 ,
and recalling that, for HS norms, ||Z||2 = ||Z∗||2 ((i) in Theorem 4.26(a)).
Now suppose A is of trace class and B ∈B(H). Then A = C D, with C and D
Hilbert–Schmidt operators by Theorem 4.34(a). In addition, DB and BC are Hilbert–
Schmidt, for B2(H) is a two-sided ideal in B(H). By swapping two HS operators at
a time:
tr AB = tr((C D)B) = tr(C(DB)) = tr((DB)C) = tr(D(BC)) = tr((BC)D)
= tr(B(C D)) = tr B A .
(c) Since B1(H) is a two-sided ideal in B(H), one operator of trace class among
A1, . . . , An is enough to render their product of trace class. In particular, using
Theorem 4.34(a) and the fact that B2(H) is a two-sided ideal of B(H) we see clearly
that if two among A1, . . . , An are HS, their product is of trace class. Then (4.50) is
equivalent to:
tr (A1A2 · · · An) = tr (A2 A3 · · · An A1) .
(4.52)

Families of Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces and Fundamental Properties
In fact, one transposition at a time, we obtain any cyclic permutation. Let us prove
(4.52). Consider ﬁrst the case of two HS operators Ai, A j, i < j. If i = 1, the claim
follows from (b) with A = A1 and B = A2 · · · An. If i > 1, the four operators (i)
A1 · · · Ai, (ii) Ai+1 · · · An, (iii) Ai+1 · · · An A1, (iv) A2 · · · Ai are necessarily HS, for
they involve either Ai or A j as factor (never both). Hence:
tr(A1 · · · An) = tr(A1 · · · Ai Ai+1 · · · An) = tr(Ai+1 · · · An A1A2 · · · Ai)
= tr(A2 · · · Ai Ai+1 · · · An A1) ,
which is what we wanted.
Let us prove invariance under permutations, assuming Ai is of trace class. If i = 1
the claim follows from part (b) by taking A = A1 and B = A2 · · · An. So suppose
i > 1. Then A1 · · · Ai and A2 · · · Ai are of trace class because both contain Ai, and
then:
tr(A1 · · · An) = tr(A1 · · · Ai Ai+1 · · · An) = tr(Ai+1 · · · An A1A2 · · · Ai)
= tr(A2 · · · Ai Ai+1 · · · An A1) ,
recalling part (b). Invariance under permutations allows to prove part (ii) in Theorem
4.34(b). Using (4.46) we have to prove tr|A| = tr|A∗|. By the corollary to the polar
decomposition theorem (Theorem 3.82) we deduce |A∗| = U|A|U ∗, where U|A| =
A is the polar decomposition of A. Hence
||A∗||1 = tr|A∗| = tr(U|A|U ∗) = tr(U ∗U|A|) = tr|A| = ||A||1 ,
where we used U ∗U|A| = |A|, for U is isometric on Ran(|A|) (Theorem 3.82).
(d) Taking (iii) in Theorem 4.26(a) into account, observing that |A|2 = A∗A, and
applying the various deﬁnitions, the only thing to be proved is

tr(|A|2) ≤tr(|A|),
that is tr(|A|2) ≤(tr(|A|))2. This inequality is trivially true if we write traces using
a basis of eigenvectors of |A|.
⊓⊔
Remark 4.39 (1) If A ∈B1(H) and A = A∗, computing the trace of A through a
basis of eigenvectors of A itself (this exists by Theorem 4.20), we conclude tr(A) =

λ∈σp(A) mλλ, where σp(A) is, as always, the set of eigenvalues of A and mλ the
dimension of the λ-eigenspace. As for ﬁnite dimensions, the trace of a self-adjoint
operator of trace class coincides with the sum of the eigenvalues. This is true even if
A is not self-adjoint, provided we clarify the meaning of eigenvalue multiplicity.
Theorem 4.40 (Lidskii) If H is a complex Hilbert space and T ∈B1(H), then
tr(T) = 
λ∈σp(T ) μλλ, where σp(T ) is the eigenvalue set of T , μλ is the algebraic
multiplicity of the eigenvalue λ, and the series converges absolutely.

4.4 Trace-Class (or Nuclear) Operators
235
The result is far from obvious, and a proof can be found in (GGK00, BiSo87).
The algebraic multiplicity is discussed in (BiSo87, p.77), so we just mention that
0 < mλ ≤μλ.
(2)TakingtheinclusionsB1(H) ⊂B2(H) ⊂B(H)intoaccount,Proposition4.38(d)
now has the following consequence. If {xn}n∈N ⊂B1(H) converges to x ∈B1(H) in
the topology of || ||1, then it converges in the topology of || · ||2. The same result holds
replacing (B1(H), || ||1) by (B2(H), || ||2) and (B2(H), || ||2) by (B(H), || ||). In
other words the topology of B1(H) is ﬁner than the topology of B2(H), and this is
in turn ﬁner than the topology of B(H).
■
To conclude we present alternative deﬁnitions of trace-class operators (stated in the
form of propositions), which can be found in textbooks.
We will be able to justify the ﬁrst one only after the spectral theorem for self-adjoint
operators:
Proposition 4.41 If H is a complex Hilbert space, T ∈B(H) is of trace class if and
only if 
u∈N |(u|T u)| < +∞for every Hilbert basis N ⊂H.
Proof See the solution to Exercise 8.20.
⊓⊔
If the Hilbert spaces is inﬁnite-dimensional and separable, there is a third character-
isation:
Proposition 4.42 If H is an inﬁnite-dimensional, separable complex Hilbert space,
T ∈B(H) is of trace class if and only if its trace is well deﬁned, i.e. +∞
n=0(un|T un)
converges to a unique s ∈C for every Hilbert basis {un}n∈N.
Proof If T is of trace class, +∞
n=0(un|T un) converges for any basis {un}n∈N, and
the sum does not depend on the basis because it is nothing but trT . If, conversely,
+∞
n=0(un|T un) = s ∈C for every basis {un}n∈N, then +∞
n=0(u′
n|T u′
n) = s where
u′
n := u f (n) for any bijection f : N →N. In other words the sum does not depend
of the summation order and may be rearranged. In view of Theorem 1.83, the series
of complex numbers +∞
n=0(un|T un) converges absolutely, i.e., +∞
n=0 |(un|T un)| <
+∞. Since this result is valid for every basis {un}n∈N of H, Proposition 4.41 proves
that T is of trace class.
⊓⊔
Example 4.43 Here some familiarity with Riemannian geometry is required.
A important trace-class operator in physics arises (see, e.g. (Mor99)) when studying
the Laplace-Beltrami operator (or Laplacian) on a Riemannian manifold (M, g). In
local coordinates x1, . . . , xn on the n-manifold M, the Laplacian is the differential
operator:
Δ =

where g is the determinant of the matrix (gi j)i, j=1,...,n that describes the metric ten-
sor in the given coordinates, and gi j are the coefﬁcients of the inverse matrix. If
V : M →(K, +∞), for a certain K > 0, is an arbitrary smooth map, we consider

236

the operator A = −Δ + V deﬁned on the space D(M) of smooth complex-valued
maps on M. We may view D(M) as a (dense) subspace in L2(M, μg), where μg, the
natural Borel measure associated to the metric, reads √gdx1 · · · dxn in local coor-
dinates. The operator A is positive, not bounded, and admits a unique inverse (also
positive): A−1 : L2(M, μg) →D(M). Thinking of A−1 as an L2(M, μg)-valued
operator, it turns out that A−1 ∈B(L2(M, μg)). The ﬁrst interesting fact is that
A−1 ∈B∞(L2(M, μg)) actually. But there is more to the story. According to a the-
orem of Weyl the eigenvalues λ j ∈σp(A) of A (where j labels eigenvectors φ j and
not eigenvalues, so that φi ̸= φk if k ̸= i but 0 < K ≤λ0 ≤λ1 ≤λ2 ≤· · · ) satisfy
the asymptotic formula:
lim

(4.53)
where vol(M) is the manifold’s volume (ﬁnite by compactness) and kn a universal

form a basis of L2(M, μg), which implies that the eigenvalue set of A−k is σp(A−k) =
{λ−k

of eigenvectors of A, we have:

Weyl’s law (4.53) implies that A−k ∈B1(L2(M, μg)) if k > n/2, and A−k ∈

Introduction to the Fredholm Theory of Integral
Equations
Integral equations are a central branch of functional analysis, especially with regard
to applications in physics (for instance in the theory of quantum scattering (Pru81)
and the study of inverse problems) and other sciences. In the sequel we shall present
general results, due to Fredholm for the most part, and we will regularly take an
abstract viewpoint, whereby integral operators are seen as particular compact opera-
tors on Hilbert spaces (even though several results can be extended to Banach spaces).
We shall essentially follow (KoFo99).
To ﬁx ideas, let us consider a measure space (X, Σ, μ), where μ : Σ →[0, +∞]
is a positive (σ-additive) measure that is σ-ﬁnite and separable, and take a map
K ∈L2(X × X, μ ⊗μ) with no further properties. Deﬁne TK ∈B2(H) to be the
usual integral operator (cf. Examples 4.18(3), (4) and 4.27(1), (2)) on H = L2(X, μ):
(TKψ)(x) :=

X
K(x, y)ψ(y)dμ(y) .
(4.54)

4.5 Introduction to the Fredholm Theory of Integral Equations
237
We wish to study, in broad terms, the following integral equation in the unknown
ϕ ∈H:
TKϕ −λϕ = f
(4.55)
where f ∈H is given and λ ∈C is a constant.
To begin with, consider the case λ = 0. This is the so-called Fredholm equation
of the ﬁrst kind on the Hilbert space H.
From the abstract point of view we have to solve for ϕ ∈H the equation:
Aϕ = f ,
where A : H →H is a compact operator (in the concrete case A is TK, a Hilbert–
Schmidt operator) and f ∈H a given element.
An important general result, valid also with an inﬁnite-dimensional Banach space
B replacing H, which assumes A compact, is that the equation has no solution for
certain f ∈H, irrespective of A ∈B∞(H). This follows from the next proposition.
Proposition 4.44 If B is a Banach space of inﬁnite dimension and A ∈B∞(B),
then Ran(A) ̸= B.
Proof We can write B = ∪n∈NBn, where Bn is the open ball of radius n at the origin,
so:
Ran(A) = ∪n∈N A(Bn) .
If Ran(A) were equal to B we could write:
B = ∪n∈N A(Bn) ⊂∪n∈N A(Bn) ⊂B,
hence
B = ∪n∈N A(Bn) ,
where any A(Bn) is compact because A is compact and Bn bounded. Therefore B
would become a countable union of compact sets, which is impossible by Corollary
4.6.
⊓⊔
The next proposition raises a second issue concerning Fredholm equations of the
ﬁrst kind.
Proposition 4.45 Let X be a normed space. Every left inverse to a compact injective
operator A ∈B∞(X) cannot be bounded if X is inﬁnite-dimensional.
Proof The proof is in Exercise 4.1.
⊓⊔
Because of this result, the solutions to Aϕ = f1 and Aϕ = f2 may be very dif-
ferent, even if f1 and f2 are close in norm. Fredholm equations of the ﬁrst kind,
in other terms, are ill posed problems à la Hadamard. This does not entail, obvi-
ously, that Fredholm equations of the 1st kind are mathematically uninteresting, nor

238
4
Families of Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces and Fundamental Properties
that they are useless in applied sciences. What it means is that their study is hard
and requires advanced and specialised topics, that reach well beyond the present
elementary treatise.
Equation (4.55), when λ ̸= 0, is called Fredholm equation of the second kind.
For a short moment we assume that TK admits a Hermitian kernel. In other terms we
consider:
TKϕ −λϕ = f ,
(4.56)
where TK has the form (4.54) with λ ̸= 0 ﬁxed, and K(x, y) = K(y, x), so that, by
(4.3), TK = T ∗
K. In such a case we can state a more general theorem.
Theorem 4.46 (Fredholm equations of the 2nd kind with Hermitian kernels) Let
H = L2(X, μ) be a Hilbert space with σ-ﬁnite and separable, positive, σ-additive
measure μ. Given f ∈H and λ ∈C \ {0}, consider Eq. (4.56) in ϕ ∈H with
(TKϕ)(x) =

X
K(x, y)ϕ(y)dμ(y) ,
where K ∈L2(X × X, μ ⊗μ) and K(x, y) = K(y, x). Then the following hold.
(a) If λ is not an eigenvalue of TK, Eq.(4.56) has always a unique solution, whichever
f ∈H.
(b) If λ is an eigenvalue of TK, (4.56) has solutions if and only if f is orthogonal to
the λ-eigenspace. In such case there exist inﬁnitely many solutions.
Proof Multiplying (4.56) by λ−1 allows to study only λ = 1 (redeﬁning λ−1K as
K and λ−1 f as f ). Hence we prove it in this case only. We know TK is compact
by Example 4.18(4) and self-adjoint up to a possible and inessential factor 1/λ. So
we shall refer to Theorems 4.19 and 4.20. Let {ψn}n∈N be a basis of Ker(TK)⊥of
eigenvectors of TK. We can decompose, uniquely, any ϕ ∈H as
ϕ =
+∞

n=1
anψn + ϕ′ ,
(4.57)
where ϕ′ ∈Ker(TK) and the an ∈C are uniquely determined by ϕ. In particular
f =
+∞

n=1
bnψn + f ′ .
Let us seek a solution to (4.56):
ϕ = TKϕ −f
in the form (4.57). We must ﬁnd the numbers an and the map ϕ′ once TK and f are
given. Substituting (4.57) and the expression of f in (4.56), we easily ﬁnd

4.5 Introduction to the Fredholm Theory of Integral Equations
239

n
anψn + ϕ′ =

n
anλnψn −

n
bnψn −f ′ ,
where λn are the non-null eigenvalues of TK corresponding to eigenvectors ψn (in
general it may happen that λn = λn′, for we have labelled eigenvectors and not
eigenvalues). That is to say:

n
an(1 −λn + bn)ψn = −f ′ −ϕ′
n .
The two sides are orthogonal by construction, and so are the vectors ψn, pairwise.
Therefore the identity is equivalent to:
ϕ′ = −f ′,
an(1 −λn) = −bn, n = 1, 2, . . ..
In any case ϕ′ is always determined, for it coincides with f ′. The existence of
solutions to (4.56) amounts to:
ϕ′ = −f ′,
an =
bn
λn−1 for λn ̸= 1
b0 = 0 for λm = 1.
If λn ̸= 1 for every n, the coefﬁcients an are uniquely determined by the bn. If λm = 1
for some m and bm ̸= 0, the last condition is false, and Eq.(4.56) has no solution.
Instead, if bm = 0 for any m such that λm = 1 (i.e. if f is normal to the 1-eigenspace
of TK), the coefﬁcients am can be chosen at will, whereas the remaining an are
determined. In this case there exist inﬁnitely many solutions to (4.56).
⊓⊔
To conclude we move to the general case and drop the assumption on Hermitian
kernels. In order to stay general we shall study the abstract Fredholm equation of the
2nd kind in the Hilbert space H:
Aϕ −λϕ = f ,
(4.58)
where f ∈H,λ ∈C \ {0}and A ∈B∞(H)aregivenonHandϕ ∈Histheproblem’s
unknown. Nothing more is assumed on A, apart from compactness. In particular, we
do not suppose A is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator. Let us prove the following general
theorem, due to Fredholm, which can be stated also for A ∈B∞(B) on a Banach
space B.
Theorem 4.47 (Fredholm) On the Hilbert space H consider the abstract Fredholm
equation of the second kind
Aϕ −λϕ = f
(4.59)

Families of Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces and Fundamental Properties
in the unknown ϕ ∈H, with f ∈H, λ ∈C \ {0} and A ∈B∞(H) given. Consider
as well the corresponding homogeneous equation, the adjoint equation and the
homogeneous adjoint equation:
Aϕ0 −λϕ0 = 0 ,
(4.60)
A∗ψ −λψ = g ,
(4.61)
A∗ψ0 −λψ0 = 0 ,
(4.62)
respectively, with g ∈H given and ϕ0, ψ, ψ0 ∈H unknown. Then
(a) Equation(4.59) admits solutions ⇔
f is orthogonal to each solution ψ0
to (4.62);
(b) either (4.59) admits exactly one solution for any f ∈H, or (4.60) has a non-
zero solution;
(c) Equation(4.60), (4.62) admit the same, ﬁnite, number of linearly independent
solutions.
Remark 4.48 (1) Statement (b) is the acclaimed Fredholm alternative.
(2) The above theorem holds in particular when A is self-adjoint, and becomes
Theorem 4.46.
■
Proof of theorem 4.47. Here, too, dividing the initial equation by λ ̸= 0 permits to
reduce to λ = 1 (after redeﬁning λ−1A as A, λ−1 f as f and λ
−1g as g). Henceforth,
then, λ = 1. Observe T := A −I is bounded but not compact, for I is not compact.
The theorem relies on three lemmas. Let us ﬁrst notice that Ker(T) is always closed
in H if T is continuous, as in the present situation, whereas Ran(T ) may not. The ﬁrst
lemma shows that Ran(T ) is closed as well, provided T := A −I with A ∈B∞(H).
Lemma 4.49 Under the assumptions made on T , Ran(T ) is closed.
Proof Let yn ∈Ran(T ), n ∈N, and suppose yn →y as n →+∞. We need to prove
y ∈Ran(T ). By assumption:
yn = T xn = Axn −xn
(4.63)
for some sequence {xn}n∈N ∈H. With no loss of generality we may assume xn ∈
Ker(T)⊥, possibly eliminating from the sequence what projects onto Ker(T). The
claimisprovenifwecanshowthesequence{xn}isbounded:infact, A beingcompact,
there will exist a subsequence xnk such that Axnk →y′ ∈H as k →∞. Substituting
in (4.63) we conclude xnk →x for some x ∈H as k →+∞. By the continuity of
A, T x = Ax −x = y, so y ∈Ran(T ).
We will proceed by contradiction, and assume {xn}n∈N ⊂Ker(T )⊥is bounded. If
not, there would be a subsequence xnm with 0 < ||xnm|| →+∞as m →+∞. Since
the yn form a convergent, hence bounded, sequence, dividing by ||xnm|| in (4.63)
gives:
T
xnm
||xnm|| = A xnm
||xnm|| −
xnm
||xnm|| =
ynm
||xnm|| →0 .
(4.64)
But A is compact and the
xnm
||xnm || are bounded, so we can extract a further subsequence
xnmk /||xnmk || such that:

4.5 Introduction to the Fredholm Theory of Integral Equations
241
xnmk
||xnmk || →x′ ∈H
and
T
xnmk
||xnmk || →T x′
as k →+∞.
By (4.64) we infer x′ ∈Ker(T ). By assumption
xnmk
||xnmk || ∈Ker(T)⊥, and Ker(T )⊥
is closed, so x′ ∈Ker(T )⊥. Consequently x′ ∈Ker(T) ∩Ker(T )⊥= {0}, in con-
tradiction to
||x′|| = lim
k→+∞
||xnmk ||
||xnmk || = 1 .
This ends the proof.
⊓⊔
The second lemma claims the following.
Lemma 4.50 Under the same assumptions on T we have orthogonal decomposi-
tions:
H = Ker(T ) ⊕Ran(T ∗) = Ker(T ∗) ⊕Ran(T ) .
(4.65)
Proof Since T, T ∗∈B(H), Theorem 3.13(e, d) and Proposition 3.38(d) imply
Ker(T) = (Ran(T ∗)⊥)⊥= Ran(T ∗), Ker(T ∗) = (Ran(T )⊥)⊥= Ran(T ), and:
H = Ker(T ) ⊕Ran(T ∗) = Ker(T ∗) ⊕Ran(T ) .
Lemma 4.49 also holds if we replace T with T ∗, for (A −I)∗= A∗−I where A∗
is compact if A is.
⊓⊔
Theorem 4.47(a) now follows from Lemma 4.50 (we still had to ﬁnish the proof
for λ = 1). In fact the lemma implies f ⊥Ker(T ∗) ⇔f ∈Ran(T ) ⇔T ϕ = f
for some ϕ ∈H.
To continue with the proof of part (b) in the main theorem we deﬁne the subspaces
Hk := Ran(T k), k = 1, 2, . . . (all closed by Lemma 4.49), so that:
H ⊃H1 ⊃H2 ⊃H3 ⊃· · ·
By construction T (Hk) = Hk+1. And now we have the third lemma.
Lemma 4.51 With T as above and Hk = Ran(T k), k = 1, 2, . . ., there exists j ∈N
such that:
Hk+1 = Hk
if k ≥j.
Proof Assume, by contradiction, that such an index j does not exist. Then Hk ̸= Hh
if k ̸= h, and we can manufacture a sequence of orthonormal vectors xk ∈Hk such
that xk ⊥H k+1, k = 1, 2, . . .. If l > k
Axl −Axk = −xk + (xl + T xl −T xk),
so ||Axl −Axk||2 ≥1 because xl + T xl −T xk ∈Hk+1. But now we cannot extract
any convergent subsequence from {Axk}, contradicting the compactness of A.
⊓⊔

242

Families of Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces and Fundamental Properties
Next we prove two lemmas that, combined, will eventually yield the proof of
Theorem 4.47(b) (for λ = 1).
Lemma 4.52 Under the previous assumptions on T , Ker(T ) = {0} ⇒Ran(T ) =
H.
Proof Assume Ker(T ) = {0}, making T one-to-one, but by contradiction suppose
Ran(T ) ̸= H. Then the Hk, k = 1, 2, 3, . . ., would be all distinct, violating lemma
4.51.
⊓⊔
Lemma 4.53 Under the assumptions made on T , Ran(T ) = H ⇒Ker(T) = {0}.
Proof If Ran(T ) = H, by Lemma 4.50 we have Ker(T ∗) = {0}. Then the previous
lemma (with T ∗instead of T ) guarantees Ran(T ∗) = H. Now Lemma 4.50 again
forces Ker(T) = {0}.
⊓⊔
Now it is patent that Lemmas 4.52 and 4.53 together prove statement (b) in
Theorem 4.47.
We ﬁnish by proving part (c) (always for λ = 1).
Suppose dim Ker(T ) = +∞, rebutting (c). Then there is an inﬁnite orthonor-
mal system {xn}n∈N ⊂Ker(T ). By construction Axn = xn and so ||Axk −Axh||2 =
2. But this cannot be, for it would run up against the existence of a subse-
quence in the bounded set {xn}n∈N such that {Axnk}k∈N converges, which is granted
by compactness. Hence dim Ker(T ) = m < +∞. Similarly dim Ker(T ∗) = n <
+∞. Assume, contradicting the statement, that m ̸= n. In particular we may sup-
pose m < n. Let {ϕ j} j=1,...,n and {ψ j} j=1,...,m be orthonormal bases for Ker(T) and
Ker(T ∗) respectively. Deﬁne S ∈B(H) by:
Sx := T x +
m

j=1
(ϕ j|x)ψ j .
As S = A′ −I, with A′ compact (obtained from the compact operator A by adding
a compact operator, since the range is ﬁnite-dimensional), the results found above
for T = A −I hold for S, too.
We claim Sx = 0 ⇒x = 0. Write, explicitly,
T x +
m

j=1
(ϕ j|x)ψ j = 0 .
(4.66)
By virtue of Lemma 4.50, all vectors ψ j are orthogonal to any one of the form T x,
so (4.66) implies T x = 0. Moreover, (ϕ j|x) = 0 if 1 ≤j ≤m, because x is a linear
combination of the ϕ j and it must simultaneously be orthogonal to them, so x = 0.
Hence Sx = 0 implies x = 0. From part (b), then, there exists y ∈H such that

4.5 Introduction to the Fredholm Theory of Integral Equations
243
Taking the inner product with ψm+1 gives a contradiction: 1 on the right equals 0
on the left, because T y ∈Ran(T ) and Ran(T ) ⊥Ker(T ∗). This shows we cannot
assume m < n. Had we instead supposed n < m earlier on, we would have run into a
similar contradiction by arguing exactly as above with the roles of T and T ∗swapped.
This eventually ends the proof of (c).
⊓⊔
Examples 4.54 An interesting instance of a Fredholm equation of the 2nd kind is
Volterra’s equation of the second kind:
ϕ(x) =
 x
a
K(x, t)ϕ(t)dt + f (x) ,
(4.67)
where ϕ ∈L2([a, b], dx) is the unknown function, f ∈L2([a, b], dx) is given and
the integral kernel satisﬁes |K(x, t)| < M < +∞for any x, t ∈[a, b], t ≤x. (Any
multiplicative factor ρ ∈C \ {0} is absorbed in K.)
This equation beﬁts the theory of Fredholm’s theorem if we rewrite the integral as
an integral over all [a, b] and assume K(x, t) = 0 if t ≥x. For this type of equation,
though, there is a better result based on contraction maps (cf. Sect.2.6). It turns
out, namely, that a certain high power of TK : L2([a, b], dx) →L2([a, b], dx) is a
contraction, where TK is the integral operator in (4.67)
(TKϕ)(x) =
 x
a
K(x, t)ϕ(t)dt .
Consequently the homogeneous equation TKϕ = 0 has one, and one only, solution
by Theorem 2.112, and the solution must be ϕ = 0. The proof that T n
K is a contraction
if n is large enough is similar to what we saw in Example 2.113(1), where the Banach
space (C([a, b]), || ||∞) is replaced by (L2([a, b], dx), || ||2) (cf. Exercise 4.19).
That said, parts (a) and (b) in Fredholm’s theorem imply that Eq.(4.67) has exactly
one solution, for any choice of the source term f ∈L2([a, b], dx).

Exercises
4.1 Prove that if X is a normed space and T : X →X is compact and injective, then
any linear operator S : Ran(T ) →X that inverts T on the left cannot be bounded if
dim X = ∞.
Solution. If S were bounded, Proposition 2.47 would allow to extend it to a
bounded operator ˜S : Y →X, where Y := Ran(T ), so that ˜ST = I. Precisely as in
the proof of Proposition 4.9(b), we can prove that ˜ST is compact if T ∈B(X, Y)
is compact and ˜S ∈B(Y, X). Then I : X →X would be compact, and thus the unit
ball in X would have compact closure, breaching Proposition 4.5.
4.2 Using Banach’s Lemma 4.12 prove that in an inﬁnite-dimensional normed space
the closed unit ball is not compact.

Families of Compact Operators on Hilbert Spaces and Fundamental Properties
Outline. Let x1, x2, . . . be an inﬁnite sequence of linearly independent vectors
with ||xn|| = 1 (hence all belonging to the closure of the unit ball). Banach’s lemma
constructs a sequence of vectors y1, y2, . . . such that ||yn|| = 1 and ||yn−1 −yn|| >
1/2. This sequence cannot contain converging subsequences.
4.3 Prove that if A∗= A ∈B∞(H) on a Hilbert space H, then
σp(|A|) = {|λ| |λ ∈σp(A)} .
Conclude that if A∗= A ∈B∞(H),
sing(A) = {|λ| |λ ∈σp(A) \ {0}} .
Solution. Expand the compact, self-adjoint operators A and |A| according to
Theorem 4.20:
A =

λ∈σp(A)
λPλ
and
|A| =

μ∈σp(|A|)
μP′
μ ,
with the obvious notation. By squaring A and |A| and using their continuity (this
allows to consider all series as ﬁnite sums), using the idempotency and orthogonality
of projectors relative to distinct eigenvectors, and recalling |A|2 = A∗A = A2, we
have

λ∈σp(A)
λ2Pλ =

μ∈σp(|A|)
μ2P′
μ .
(4.68)
Now keep in mind PλPλ0 = 0 if λ ̸= λ0 and PλPλ0 = Pλ0 otherwise, and the same
holds for the projectors in the decomposition of |A|. Composing with Pλ0 on the
right in (4.68), taking adjoints and eventually right-composing with P′
μ0 produces
λ2

μ0 = μ2

μ0 = 0 ,
(4.69)
for any λ0 ∈σ(A) and μ0 ∈σp(|A|). The fact that A admits a basis of eigenvectors
(Theorem 4.20) is known to be equivalent to
I = s-

λ0∈σ(A)
Pλ0 .
Fix μ0 ∈σp(|A|). If Pλ0 P′
μ0 = 0 for any λ0 ∈σ(A), from the above identity we
would have P′
μ0 = 0, absurd by deﬁnition of eigenspace. Therefore, (4.69) with-
standing,theremustexistλ0 ∈σ(A)suchthatλ2
0 = μ2
0,i.e.μ0 = |λ0|.Ifλ0 ∈σp(A),
swapping A and |A| and using a similar argument would produce μ0 ∈σp(|A|) such
that λ2

0, i.e. μ0 = |λ0|. The ﬁrst assertion is thus proved. The second one is
evident by the deﬁnition of singular value.

4.4 Consider a separable Hilbert space H with basis { fn}n∈N ⊂H and the sequence
{sn}n∈N ⊂C where |sn| ≥|sn+1| and |sn| →0 as n →+∞. Using the uniform topol-

is well deﬁned and T ∈B∞(H). Show that if every sn is real, T is further self-adjoint
and every sn is an eigenvalue of T .

n=M
|( fn|x)|2 ≤|sM|2||x||2
for N ≥M. Taking the least upper bound over unit vectors x ∈H gives:
||TN −TM|| ≤|sM|2 →0
as N, M →+∞,
whence the ﬁrst part. The rest follows by direct inspection.
4.5 Prove that if T ∈B∞(H) and if H ∋xn →x ∈H weakly, i.e.
(g|xn) →(g|x)
as n →+∞, for any given g ∈H,
then ||T(xn) −T (x)|| →0 as n →+∞. Put otherwise, compact operators map
weakly convergent sequences to sequences converging in norm. Extend the result to
the case T ∈B∞(X, Y), X and Y normed.
Solution. Suppose xn →x weakly. If we bear in mind Riesz’s theorem, the set
{xn}n∈N is immediately weakly bounded in the sense of Corollary 2.64. According to
this corollary, ||xn|| ≤K for any n ∈N and for some K > 0. So deﬁne yn := T xn,
y := T x and note that for any h ∈H,
(h|yn) −(h|y) = (T ∗h|xn) −(T ∗h|x) →0
as n →+∞,
hence also the yn converge weakly to y. Suppose, by contradiction, ||yn −y|| ̸→0
as n →+∞. Then there exist ε > 0 and a subsequence {ynk}k∈N with ||y −ynk|| ≥ε
for any k ∈N. Since {xnk}k∈N is bounded by K, and T is compact, there must be a
subsequence {ynkr }r∈N converging to some y′ ̸= y. This subsequence {ynkr }r∈N has
to converge to y′ also weakly. But this cannot be, for {yn}n∈N converges weakly to
y ̸= y′. Therefore yn →y in the norm of H. The argument works in the more general
casewhere T ∈B∞(X, Y),X andY normedspaces,byinterpretingX ∋xn →x ∈X
in weak sense:
g(xn) →g(x)
as n →+∞, for any given g ∈X′,

Densely-Deﬁned Unbounded Operators
on Hilbert Spaces
Von Neumann had just about ended his lecture when a student
stood up and in a vaguely abashed tone said he hadn’t under-
stood the ﬁnal argument. Von Neumann answered:
“Young man, in mathematics you don’t understand things. You
just get used to them.”
David Wells
This chapter will extend the theory seen so far to unbounded operators that are not
necessarily deﬁned on the entire space.
In section one we will deﬁne, in particular, the standard domain of an operator
built by composing operators with non-maximal domains. We will introduce closed
and closable operators. Then we shall study adjoint operators to unbounded and
densely-deﬁned operators, thus generalising the similar notion for bounded operators
deﬁned on the whole Hilbert space.
The second section deals with generalisations of self-adjoint operators to the
unbounded case. For this we will introduce Hermitian, symmetric, essentially self-
adjoint and self-adjoint operators, and discuss their main properties. In particular we
will deﬁne the core of an operator and the deﬁciency index.
Section three is entirely devoted to two examples of self-adjoint operators of
the foremost importance in Quantum Mechanics, namely the operators position and
momentum on the Hilbert space L2(Rn, dx). We will study their mathematical prop-
erties and present several equivalent deﬁnitions.
In the ﬁnal section we shall discuss more advanced criteria to establish whether a
symmetric operator admits self-adjoint extensions. We will present von Neumann’s
criterion and Nelson’s criterion. The technical instruments needed for this study are
the Cayley transform and analytic vectors: the latter, deﬁned by Nelson, turned out
to be crucial in the applications of operator theory to QM.

Densely-Deﬁned Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
5.1
Unbounded Operators with Non-maximal Domains
Let us introduce the theory of unbounded operators with non-maximal domains. The
domains under exam will always be vector subspaces of some ambient space, and
we will often consider dense subspaces. Despite the operators of concern will not be
bounded, all deﬁnitions will reduce in the bounded case to the ones seen in earlier
chapters.
5.1.1
Unbounded Operators with Non-maximal Domains
in Normed Spaces
The ﬁrst deﬁnitions are completely general and do not require any Hilbert structure.
A notion of graph was already given in Deﬁnition 2.98 for operators with maximal
domain. The following deﬁnition extends Deﬁnition2.98 slightly.
Deﬁnition 5.1 Let X be a vector space. We shall call a linear mapping
T : D(T) →X ,
an operator on X, where D(T) ⊂X is a subspace called the domain of T. The
graph of the operator T is the subspace of X ⊕X (see Deﬁnition2.97(3))
G(T) := {(x, Tx) ∈X ⊕X | x ∈D(T)} .
If α ∈C, and A, B are operators on X with domains D(A), D(B), we deﬁne the
following operators on H:
(a) AB, given by ABf := A(Bf ) on the standard domain:
D(AB) := {f ∈D(B) | Bf ∈D(A)}
(b) A + B, given by (A + B)f := Af + Bf on the standard domain:
D(A + B) := D(A) ∩D(B)
(c) αA, given by αAf := α(Af ) on the standard domain: D(αA) = D(A) if
α ̸= 0, and D(0A) := X.
Remark 5.2 By taking standard domains the usual associative properties of the sum
and product of operators hold. If A, B, C are operators on X:
A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C ,
(AB)C = A(BC) .

5.1 Unbounded Operators with Non-maximal Domains
253
Distributive properties are weaker than expected (see Deﬁnition 5.3 below for the
meaning of ⊃):
(A + B)C = AC + BC ,
A(B + C) ⊃AB + AC ,
for it may happen that (B+C)x ∈D(A) even if Bx or Cx do not belong in D(A).
■
The above notion of graph evidently coincides with the familiar graph of T ∈
L(X), where the latter is nothing else than an operator on X with D(T) = X.
Extensions of closed operators play a central role in the sequel. The ﬁrst notion
is straightforward.
Deﬁnition 5.3 If A is an operator on the vector space X, an operator B on X is called
an extension of A, written A ⊂B, or B ⊃A, if G(A) ⊂G(B).
Remark 5.4 With the above deﬁnitions of standard domains, it is easy to prove that
for any operators A, B, C on X,
(i) A ⊂B and B ⊂C ⇒A ⊂C;
(ii) A ⊂B and B ⊂A ⇔A = B;
(iii) A ⊂B ⇒AC ⊂BC and CA ⊂CB;
(iv) if D(A) = X, then AB ⊂BA ⇒A(D(B)) ⊂D(B);
(v) if D(A) = X, then AB = BA ⇒A(D(B)) ⊂D(B) and D(B) = A−1(D(B)) (so
that A(D(B)) = D(B) if A is surjective).
■
5.1.2
Closed and Closable Operators
We shall extend the reach of Deﬁnition 2.98, allowing for domains smaller than the
whole space. This will accommodate new concepts, such as closed operators.
We remind that if X is normed, the product topology on the Cartesian product X×X
is the one whose open sets are ∅and unions of products of open balls Bδ(x)×Bδ1(x1)
centred at x, x1 ∈X with any radii δ, δ1 > 0.
Deﬁnition 5.5 Let A be an operator on the normed space X.
(a) A is called closed if its graph is closed in the product topology of X × X.
Consequently A is closed if and only if for any sequence {xn}n∈N ⊂D(A) such that:

254
5
Densely-Deﬁned Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
(i) xn →x ∈X as n →+∞and
(ii) Axn →y ∈X as n →+∞,
it follows x ∈D(A) and y = Ax.
(b) A is closable if the closure G(A) of its graph is the graph of a (necessarily closed)
operator. The latter is denoted A and is called the closure of A.
The next proposition characterises closable operators.
Proposition 5.6 Let A be an operator on the normed space X. The following facts
are equivalent:
(i) A is closable,
(ii) G(A) does not contain elements of type (0, z), z ̸= 0,
(iii) A admits closed extensions.
Proof (i) ⇔(ii). A is not closable iff there exist sequences in D(A), say {xn}n∈N and
{x′
n}n∈N, such that xn →x ←x′
n, and Axn →y ̸= y′ ←Ax′
n. By linearity this is the
same as saying there is a sequence x′′
n = xn−x′
n →0 such that Ax′′
n →y−y′ = z ̸= 0.
In turn, this amounts to G(A) containing points (0, z) ̸= (0, 0).
(i) ⇔(iii). If A is closable, A is a closed extension of A. Conversely, if there is a closed
extension B of A, there cannot be in G(A) elements of the kind (0, z) ̸= (0, 0), for
otherwise G(B) = G(B) ⊃G(A) ∋(0, z), since A ⊂B and B is closed. Therefore
B would not be linear as B(0) ̸= 0.
⊓⊔
Here is a useful general property of closable operators on Banach (hence Hilbert)
spaces.
Proposition 5.7 Let X, Y be Banach spaces, T ∈B(X, Y) and A : D(A) →Y an
operator on Y (in general unbounded, and with D(A) properly contained in Y). If
(i) A is closable,
(ii) Ran(T) ⊂D(A),
then AT ∈B(X, Y).
Proof As the closure of A extends A, AT = AT is well deﬁned. Now it sufﬁces to
show AT : X →Y is closed and invoke the closed graph theorem (Theorem 2.99) to
conclude. To prove AT is closed, assume X ∋xn →x ∈X and (AT)(xn) →y ∈Y as
n →+∞. Then Txn →z ∈Y, for T is continuous. As A is closed and A(Txn) →y,
then z ∈D(A) and Az = y. That is to say, (AT)(x) = y. Therefore AT is closed by
deﬁnition.
⊓⊔
5.1.3
The Case of Hilbert Spaces: The Structure of H ⊕H
and the Operator τ
Let us look at the situation in which X = H is a Hilbert space with inner product
( | ). We know that there is a convenient way to deﬁne a Hilbert space structure on

5.1 Unbounded Operators with Non-maximal Domains
255
the direct sum H ⊕H, yielding the Hilbert sum of H with itself. This structure was
presented in Deﬁnition 3.67, referring to a much more general situation. Here we
wish to make further comments on the elementary case at hand. From Deﬁnition3.67,
we know that the inner product:
((x, x′)|(y, y′))H⊕H := (x|y) + (x′|y′) if (x, x′), (y, y′) ∈H ⊕H
(5.1)
makes the two summands of H⊕H mutually orthogonal, so the sum is not only direct,
but orthogonal. Furthermore, it turns H⊕H into a Hilbert space, for the induced norm
|| ||H⊕H satisﬁes:
||(z, z′)||2
H⊕H = ||z||2 + ||z′||2
for any (z, z′) ∈H ⊕H.
(5.2)
Let us see how. Any Cauchy sequence {(xn, x′
n)}n∈N ⊂H ⊕H for the norm || ||H⊕H
determines Cauchy sequences in H: {xn}n∈N and {x′
n}n∈N. The latter converge to x and
x′ in H respectively. It is therefore immediate to see (xn, x′
n) →(x, x′) as n →+∞
in norm || ||H⊕H, by (5.2). Therefore (H ⊕H, || ||H⊕H) is complete. Topologically
speaking, H ⊕H can be endowed with the product topology of H × H, the same
used to deﬁne the closure of an operator. But this is exactly the topology induced by
the inner product. To see this directly, in analogy to the discussion of Sect.2.3.6, it
sufﬁces to recall the inclusions of open balls
Bδ/2(x) × Bδ/2(y) ⊂B(H⊕H)
δ
((x, y)) ⊂Bδ(x) × Bδ(y),
where B(H⊕H)
δ
((x, y)) ⊂H ⊕H has centre (x, y) ∈H ⊕H and radius δ > 0, while
Bε(z) ⊂H has centre z and radius ε > 0.
A useful tool to prove results quickly is the bounded operator
τ : H ⊕H ∋(x, y) →(−y, x) ∈H ⊕H .
(5.3)
If we refer ∗and ⊥to the Hilbert space H ⊕H, then:
τ ∗= τ −1 = −τ ,
(5.4)
so, in particular, τ is unitary on H ⊕H. Moreover, a direct computation shows τ and
⊥commute:
τ(F⊥) = (τ(F))⊥
(5.5)
for any F ⊂H ⊕H.

Densely-Deﬁned Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
5.1.4
General Properties of the Hermitian Adjoint Operator
We now pass to deﬁne the Hermitian adjoint of an (unbounded) operator T whose
domain D(T) is dense in a Hilbert space H.
We cannot rely on Riesz’s theorem and must proceed differently. First of all let us
deﬁne the domain D(T ∗) of the adjoint, bearing in mind we are aiming at obtaining
(T ∗x|y) = (x|Ty) with x ∈D(T ∗) and y ∈D(T). To this end we put
D(T∗) :=

x ∈H | there exists zT,x ∈H with (x|Ty) = (zT,x|y) for any y ∈D(T)

,
(5.6)
and later we will set T ∗x := zT,x, x ∈D(T ∗).
At any rate, let us show deﬁnition (5.6) is well posed, ﬁrst, and that it determines:
(a) a subspace D(T ∗) ⊂H, and (b) an operator T ∗: D(T ∗) ∋x →zT,x.
(a) D(T ∗) ̸= ∅for 0 ∈D(T ∗) if we deﬁne zT,0 := 0. Moreover, by linearity of
the inner product and of T, if x, x′ ∈D(T ∗) and α, β ∈C then αx + βx′ ∈D(T ∗).
That happens because (αx + βx′|Ty) = (zT,αx+βx′|y) if zT,αx+βx′ := αzT,x + βzT,x′.
Hence D(T ∗) is a subspace.
(b) The assignment D(T ∗) ∋x →zT,x =: T ∗x will deﬁne a function, linear by
construction as we saw above, only if any x ∈D(T ∗) determines a unique element
zT,x. We claim that this is the case when D(T ∗) is dense, as we have assumed.
If (z′
T,x|y) = (x|Ty) = (zT,x|y) for any y ∈D(T), then 0 = (x|Ty) −(x|Ty) =
(zT,x −z′
T,x|y). Since D(T) = H, there exists {yn}n∈N ⊂D(T) with yn →zT,x −z′
T,x.
The inner product is continuous, so (zT,x −z′
T,x|y) = 0 implies ||zT,x −z′
T,x||2 = 0
and then zT,x = z′
T,x.
Deﬁnition 5.8 (Adjoint operator) If T is an operator on the Hilbert space H with
D(T) = H, the (Hermitian) adjoint operator to T, denoted T ∗, is the operator on
H with domain
D(T ∗) :=

x ∈H | there exists zT,x ∈H with (x|Ty) = (zT,x|y) for any y ∈D(T

deﬁned by T ∗: x →zT,x.
Remark 5.9 (1) It is clear that by construction
(T∗x|y) = (x|Ty) ,
for any pair (x, y) ∈D(T ∗) × D(T)
as we wanted.
(2) If T ∈B(H), Deﬁnition 5.8 implies immediately D(T ∗) = H by Riesz’s
Theorem3.16. Hence:

5.1 Unbounded Operators with Non-maximal Domains
257
Deﬁnitions 5.8 and 3.37 coincide for adjoints to operators in B(H).
(3) If T is a densely-deﬁned operator on the Hilbert space H, D(T ∗) is not automat-
ically dense in H. Therefore (T ∗)∗will not exist, in general.
(4) If A, B are densely-deﬁned operators on the Hilbert space H:
A ⊂B
⇒
A∗⊃B∗.
(5.7)
The proof is straightforward from Deﬁnition 5.8.
(5) If A, B are operators on the Hilbert space H with dense domains, and D(AB) is
dense, then
B∗A∗⊂(AB)∗.
Furthermore
B∗A∗= (AB)∗
if A ∈B(H).
Similarly, if D(A + B) is dense,
A∗+ B∗⊂(A + B)∗.
Furthermore
A∗+ B∗= (A + B)∗
if A ∈B(H).
The proofs are deferred to the exercise section at the end of this chapter.

Theorem 5.10 Let A be an operator on the Hilbert space H with D(A) = H. Then
(a) A∗is closed and
G(A∗) = τ(G(A))⊥.
(5.8)
(b) A is closable ⇔D(A∗) is dense, in which case
A ⊂A = (A∗)∗.
(c) Ker(A∗) = [Ran(A)]⊥and Ker(A) ⊂[Ran(A∗)]⊥, with equality if D(A∗) is dense
in H and A is closed.
(d) If A is closed then H ⊕H splits orthogonally:
H ⊕H = τ(G(A)) ⊕G(A∗) .
(5.9)

258
5
Densely-Deﬁned Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
Proof (a) Write τ(G(A))⊥explicitly, using (5.5):
τ(G(A))⊥= {(x, y) ∈H ⊕H | −(x|Az) + (y|z) = 0
for any z ∈D(A)} .
That is to say, τ(G(A))⊥is the graph of A∗(so long as the operator is deﬁned!) and
(5.8) holds. By construction τ(G(A))⊥is closed, being an orthogonal complement
(Theorem 3.13(a)), so A∗is closed.
(b) Consider the closure of the graph of A. Then we have G(A) = (G(A)⊥)⊥by
Theorem 3.13. Since ττ = −I, S⊥= −S⊥for any set S, and because (5.5), (5.8)
hold, we have:
G(A) = −τ( τ(G(A))⊥)⊥= −τ(G(A∗))⊥= τ(G(A∗))⊥.
(5.10)
By Proposition 5.6, G(A) is the graph of an operator (the closure of A) iff G(A) does
not contain elements (0, z), z ̸= 0. I.e., G(A) is not the graph of an operator iff there
exists z ̸= 0 such that (0, z) ∈τ(G(A∗))⊥. More explicitly
there exists z ̸= 0 such that
0 = ((0, z)|(−A∗x, x)) ,
for any x ∈D(A∗) .
Put equivalently, G(A) is not the graph of an operator iff D(A∗)⊥̸= {0}, which
happens precisely when D(A∗) is not dense in H. To sum up: G(A) is a graph ⇔
D(A∗) = H.
If D(A∗) is dense in H, then (A∗)∗exists, and by (5.10), (5.8) we have
G(A) = τ(G(A∗))⊥= G((A∗)∗) .
Eventually, by deﬁnition of closure, G(A) = G(A). Substituting above:
G(A) = G((A∗)∗) ,
so A = (A∗)∗.
(c) The claims descend directly from
(A∗x|y) = (x|Ay) ,
for any pair(x, y) ∈D(A∗) × D(A)
by the density of D(A), and from (b) when A is closed.
(d) Since A is closed, G(A) is closed and so τ(G(A)) is closed, because τ :
H⊕H →H⊕H is unitary. From (5.8) and Theorem 3.13 (b, d) we have immediately
(5.9). This ends the proof.
⊓⊔
Remark 5.11 The density of D(A) implies (A −λI)∗= A∗−λI for λ ∈C, so the
ﬁrst equation in (c) has the immediate consequence:
Ker(A∗−λI) = [Ran(A −λI)]⊥,

5.1 Unbounded Operators with Non-maximal Domains
259
while the second equation yields:
Ker(A −λI) ⊂[Ran(A∗−λI)]⊥.
In the rest of the book these relations will be used repeatedly.

5.2
Hermitian, Symmetric, Self-adjoint and Essentially
Self-adjoint Operators
We are now in a position to deﬁne in full generality self-adjoint operators and related
objects.
Deﬁnition 5.12 Let (H, ( | )) be a Hilbert space. An operator A : D(A) →H on H
is called
(a) Hermitian if (Ax||y) = (x|Ay) for any x, y ∈D(A);
(b) symmetric if:
(i) A is Hermitian and
(ii) D(A) is dense;
therefore A is symmetric if and only if:
(i)’ D(A) = H and
(ii)’ A ⊂A∗;
(c) self-adjoint if:
(i) D(A) is dense and
(ii) A = A∗;
(d) essentially self-adjoint if:
(i) D(A) is dense,
(ii) D(A∗) is dense and
(iii) A∗= (A∗)∗(the adjoint is self-adjoint).
Equivalently (by Theorem 5.10(b)), A is essentially self-adjoint if:
(i)’ D(A) is dense,
(ii)’ A is closable and
(iii)’ A∗= A;
(e) normal if A∗A = AA∗, where either side is deﬁned on its standard domain.

Densely-Deﬁned Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
Remark 5.13 (1) A comment on (c) in Deﬁnition 5.12: by Theorem 5.10(a), every
self-adjoint operator is automatically closed.
(2) It is worth noting that:
(i) the deﬁnitions of Hermitian, symmetric, self-adjoint and essentially self-adjoint
operator coincide when the operator’s domain is the whole Hilbert space;
(ii) the following important result holds.
Theorem 5.14 (Hellinger-Toeplitz) A Hermitian operator with the entire Hilbert
space as domain is necessarily bounded (and self-adjoint in the sense of deﬁnition
3.56).
Proof Boundedness follows from Proposition 3.60(d). The operator is therefore self-
adjoint, according to Deﬁnition 3.9.
⊓⊔
(iii) Bounded self-adjoint operators for Deﬁnition 3.56 are precisely the self-adjoint
operators of Deﬁnition 5.12 with domain the whole space.
(3) Essential self-adjointness is by far the most important property of the four for
applications to QM, on the following grounds. As we will explain soon, an essen-
tially self-adjoint operator admits a unique self-adjoint extension, so it retains the
information of a self-adjoint operator, essentially. For reasons we shall see later in
the book, paramount operators in QM are self-adjoint. At the same time it is a fact
that differential operators are the easiest to handle in QM. It often turns out that
QM’s differential operators become essentially self-adjoint if deﬁned on suitable
domains. Thus self-adjoint differential operators are on one hand easy to employ,
on the other they carry, in essence, the information of self-adjoint operators useful
in QM. Because of this we will indulge on certain features related to essential self-
adjointness.
(4) Given an operator A : D(A) →H on the Hilbert space H, B ∈B(H) commutes
with A when:
BA ⊂AB .
If the domain of A is dense and so A∗exists, it is easy to check that if B ∈B(H)
commutes with A then B∗commutes with A∗(prove it as an exercise). Denote by
{A}′ the commutant of A : D(A) →H:
{A}′ := {B ∈B(H) | BA ⊂AB}
If A = A∗then {A}′ is a unital ∗-subalgebra of B(H) that is closed in the strong topol-
ogy (prove it as an exercise). Therefore it is a von Neumann algebra (see Sect.3.3.2).
The double commutant {A}′′ := {{A}′}′ is still a von Neumann algebra, called the
von Neumann algebra generated by A.

5.2 Hermitian, Symmetric, Self-adjoint and Essentially Self-adjoint Operators
261
The following important, yet elementary, proposition will be frequently used without
explicit mention. Its easy proof is left to the reader.
Proposition 5.15 LetH1,H2 beHilbertspacesandU : H1 →H2 aunitaryoperator.
If A : D(A) →H1 is an operator on H1, consider the operator on H2
A2 : D(A2) →H2 with A2 := UA1U −1and D(A2) := UD(A1).
Then A2 is closable, or closed, Hermitian, symmetric, essentially self-adjoint, self-
adjoint, or normal if and only if A1 is alike.
Notation 5.16 From now on we shall also write A∗∗···∗instead of (((A∗)∗) · · · )∗. ■
Proposition 5.17 Let (H, ( | )) be a Hilbert space and A an operator on H.
(a) If D(A) and D(A∗), are dense,
A∗= A
∗= A∗= A∗∗∗.
(5.11)
In particular the identities are true when A is symmetric.
(b) A is essentially self-adjoint ⇔A is self-adjoint.
(c) If A is self-adjoint, it is maximal symmetric, i.e. it has no proper symmetric
extensions.
(d) If A is essentially self-adjoint, A admits only one self-adjoint extension: A (coin-
ciding with A∗).
Proof (a) If D(A) and D(A∗) are dense, the operators A∗, A∗∗and A∗∗∗exist (in
particular D(A∗∗) ⊃D(A) is dense). Moreover
A
∗= (A∗∗)∗= A∗∗∗= (A∗)∗∗= A∗
by Theorem 5.10(b). Since A∗is closed (by Theorem 5.10(a)) we have A∗= A∗. If
A is symmetric, it has dense domain, so that A∗⊃A has dense domain as well.
(b) If A is essentially self-adjoint, A = A∗, and in particular D(A) = D(A∗) is
dense. Compute the adjoint of A and recall Theorem 5.10(b): A
∗= (A∗)∗= A, i.e.
A is self-adjoint.
Vice versa, if A is self-adjoint, i.e. there exists A
∗= A, then D(A), D(A∗), D(A∗∗)
are dense and by part (a): A∗= A∗= A
∗. Hence A∗= A, and A is essentially
self-adjoint.
(c) Let A be self-adjoint and A ⊂B, B symmetric. Taking adjoints gives A∗⊃B∗.
But B∗⊃B by symmetry, so
A ⊂B ⊂B∗⊂A∗= A ,
and then A = B = B∗.

262
5
Densely-Deﬁned Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
(d) Let A∗= A∗∗, A ⊂B with B = B∗. Taking the adjoint of A ⊂B we see that
B = B∗⊂A∗. Taking the adjoint twice yields A∗∗⊂B, but then
B = B∗⊂A∗= A∗∗⊂B ,
hence B = A∗∗. The latter coincides with A by Theorem 5.10(b).
⊓⊔
Now we discuss two crucial features that characterise self-adjoint and essentially
self-adjoint operators.
Theorem 5.18 Let A be a symmetric operator on the Hilbert space H. The following
are equivalent:
(a) A is self-adjoint;
(b) A is closed and Ker(A∗± iI) = {0};
(c) Ran(A ± iI) = H.
Proof (a) ⇒(b). If A = A∗, A is closed because A∗is. If x ∈Ker(A∗+ iI), then
Ax = −ix, so
i(x|x) = (Ax|x) = (x|Ax) = (x| −ix) = −i(x|x) ,
whence (x|x) = 0 and x = 0.
The proof that Ker(A∗−iI) = {0} is analogous.
(b) ⇒(c). By deﬁnition of adjoint we have (see Remark 5.11) [Ran(A −iI)]⊥=
Ker(A∗+ iI). Hence part (b) implies Ran(A −iI) is dense in H. Now we shall use
the closure of A to show that Ran(A −iI) = H. Fix y ∈H arbitrarily and choose
{xn}n∈N ⊂D(A) so that (A −iI)xn →y ∈H. For z ∈D(A),
||(A −iI)z||2 = ||Az||2 + ||z||2 ≥||z||2 ,
whence {xn}n∈N is a Cauchy sequence and x = limn→+∞xn exists. The closure of A
forces A−iI to be closed, so (A−iI)x = y and then Ran(A−iI) = Ran(A −iI) = H.
The proof of Ker(A∗−iI) = {0} is similar.
(c) ⇒(a). Since A ⊂A∗by symmetry, it is enough to show D(A∗) ⊂D(A). Take
y ∈D(A∗). Given that Ran(A −iI) = H, there is a vector x−∈D(A) such that
(A −iI)x−= (A∗−iI)y .
On D(A) the operator A∗coincides with A and therefore, by the previous identity,
(A∗−iI)(y −x−) = 0 .
But Ker(A∗−iI) = Ran(A + iI)⊥= {0}, so y = x−and y ∈D(A). The argument
for Ran(A + iI) is completely analogous.
⊓⊔

5.2 Hermitian, Symmetric, Self-adjoint and Essentially Self-adjoint Operators
263
Theorem 5.19 Let A be a symmetric operator on the Hilbert space H. The following
are equivalent:
(a) A is essentially self-adjoint;
(b) Ker(A∗± iI) = {0};
(c) Ran(A ± iI) = H.
Proof (a) ⇒(b). If A is essentially self-adjoint, then A∗= A∗∗and A∗is self-adjoint
(and closed). Applying Theorem 5.18 gives Ker(A∗∗± iI) = {0} and so (b) holds,
for A∗∗= A∗.
(b) ⇒(a). A ⊂A∗by assumption, and because D(A) is dense so is D(A∗). Con-
sequently, Theorem 5.10(b) implies A is closable and A ⊂A = A∗∗(in particular
D(A∗∗) = D(A) ⊃D(A) is dense). Therefore A ⊂A∗implies A ⊂A∗, and Proposi-
tion 5.17(a) tells A∗= A
∗. Overall, A ⊂A
∗, i.e. A is symmetric. Then we may apply
Theorem 5.18 to A, for this operator satisﬁes (b) in the theorem. We conclude A is
self-adjoint. From Proposition 5.17(b) it follows A is essentially self-adjoint.
(b) ⇔(c). Since Ran(A±iI)⊥= Ker(A∗∓iI) and Ran(A ± iI)⊕Ran(A±iI)⊥= H,
(b) and (c) are equivalent.
⊓⊔
To ﬁnish we present a useful notion for the applications: the core of an operator.
Deﬁnition 5.20 Let A be a closed, densely-deﬁned operator on the Hilbert space H.
A dense subspace S ⊂D(A) is a core of A if
A ↾S = A .
The next proposition is obvious, yet important.
Proposition 5.21 If A is a self-adjoint operator on the Hilbert space H, a subspace
S ⊂D(A) is a core for A if and only if A ↾S is essentially self-adjoint.
Proof If A ↾S is essentially self-adjoint, it admits a unique self-adjoint extension,
which coincides with its closure by Proposition 5.17(d). In our case the extension
necessarily coincides with A, which is self-adjoint. Hence A ↾S is a core.
Conversely, if A ↾S is a core, the closure of A ↾S is self-adjoint because it coincides
with the self-adjoint A. By Proposition 5.17(b) A ↾S is essentially self-adjoint.
⊓⊔
5.3
Two Major Applications: The Position Operator
and the Momentum Operator
To exemplify the formalism described so far we study the features of two self-adjoint
operators of the foremost relevance in QM, called position operator and momentum
operator. Their physical meaning will be clariﬁed in the second part of the book.
In the sequel we shall adopt the conventions and notations of Sect.3.7, and x =
(x1, . . . , xn) will be a generic point in Rn.

Densely-Deﬁned Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
5.3.1
The Position Operator
Deﬁnition 5.22 (Position operator) Consider H := L2(Rn, dx), where dx is the
Lebesgue measure on Rn. If i ∈{1, 2, . . . , n} is given, the operator on H:
(Xif )(x) = xif (x) ,
(5.12)
with domain:
D(Xi) :=

f ∈L2(Rn, dx)


Rn |xif (x)|2 dx < +∞

,
(5.13)
is called ith position operator.
Proposition 5.23 The operator Xi of Deﬁnition 5.22 satisﬁes these properties.
(a) Xi is self-adjoint.
(b) D(Rn) and S (Rn) are cores: Xi = Xi ↾D(Rn) = Xi ↾S (Rn).
Proof (a) The domain of Xi is certainly dense in H for it contains the space D(Rn) of
smooth maps with compact support, and also the space of Schwartz functions S (Rn)
(see Notation 3.100), both of which are dense in L2(Rn, dx). Therefore Xi admits an
adjoint. By deﬁnition we have (g|Xif ) = (Xig|f ) if f , g ∈D(Xi). Consequently Xi is
Hermitian and symmetric. We claim it is self-adjoint, too. By symmetry Xi ⊂X∗
i , so
it sufﬁces to show D(X∗
i ) ⊂D(Xi). Let us deﬁne the adjoint to Xi directly: f ∈D(X∗
i )
if and only if there exists h ∈L2(Rn, dx) (h = X∗
i f by deﬁnition) such that

Rn f (x)xig(x)dx =

Rn h(x)g(x)dx
for anyg ∈D(Xi).
Since D(Xi) is dense and

Rn[xif (x) −h(x)]g(x)dx = 0 for any g ∈D(Xi),
we can also say f ∈L2(Rn, dx) belongs to D(X∗
i )
⇔
xif (x) = h(x) almost
everywhere, with h ∈L2(Rn, dx).
Hence D(X∗
i ) consists precisely of maps f ∈L2(Rn, dx) for which

Rn |xif (x)|2 dx < +∞,
and so D(X∗
i ) = D(Xi) and Xi is self-adjoint.

5.3 Two Major Applications: The Position Operator and the Momentum Operator
265
(b) If we deﬁne Xi as above, apart from restricting the domain to D(Rn) or S (Rn),
the operator thus obtained is no longer self-adjoint, but stays symmetric. The adjoints
to Xi ↾D(Rn) and Xi ↾S (Rn) both coincide with the above X∗
i , for in the construction
we only used that Xi is the operator that multiplies by xi on a dense domain: whether
this is the D(Xi) of (5.13), or a dense subspace, does not alter the result. If we deﬁne
Xi through (5.12) and (5.13), the adjoint X∗
i must satisfy Ker(X∗
i ± iI) = {0} by
Theorem 5.18(b). But as X∗
i is the same as we get by restricting the domain of Xi
to D(Rn) or S (Rn) by Theorem 5.19(b), the restricted Xi is essentially self-adjoint.
Part (b) is now an immediate consequence of Proposition 5.21.
⊓⊔
5.3.2
The Momentum Operator
Let us introduce the momentum operator. Henceforth we adopt the deﬁnitions and
conventions taken from Example 2.91, and retain Notation 3.100. First, though, we
need a few deﬁnitions.
We say f : Rn →C is a locally integrable function on Rn if f · g ∈L1(Rn, dx)
for any map g ∈D(Rn).
Deﬁnition 5.24 Let f be locally integrable and α a multi-index. A map h : Rn →C
is the αth weak derivative of f , written w-∂αf = h, if h is locally integrable and:

Rn h(x)g(x) dx = (−1)|α|

Rn f (x)∂α
x g(x) dx
(5.14)
for any map g ∈D(Rn).
Remark 5.25 (1) If it exists, a weak derivative is uniquely determined up to sets of
zero measure: if h and h′ are locally integrable (the following is trivial if they are in
L2(Rn, dx)) and satisfy (5.14), then:

Rn(h(x) −h′(x))g(x) dx = 0 for anyg ∈D(Rn).
(5.15)
This implies h(x) −h′(x) = 0 almost everywhere by the Du Bois–Reymond lemma
[Vla02]:
Lemma 5.26 (Du Bois–Reymond) Suppose φ is a locally integrable map on Rn.
Then: φ is zero almost everywhere ⇔

Rn φ(x)f (x) dx = 0 for any f ∈D(Rn).
(2) In case f ∈C|α|(Rn), the αth weak derivative of f exists and coincides with the
usual derivative (up to a zero-measure set). However, there are situations in which
the ordinary derivative does not exist, whereas the weak derivative is deﬁned.

266

Densely-Deﬁned Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
(3) Maps in L2(Rn, dx) are locally integrable, for D(Rn) ⊂L2(Rn, dx) and f ·g ∈L1
if f , g ∈L2.
■
In order to deﬁne the momentum operator let us construct the operator Aj on H :=
L2(Rn, dx):
(Ajf )(x) = −iℏ∂
∂xj
f (x)
with D(Aj) := D(Rn),
(5.16)
where ℏis a positive constant (Planck’s constant), whose precise value is irrelevant
at present. By deﬁnition we have (g|Ajf ) = (Ajg|f ) if f , g ∈D(Aj). Thus Aj is
symmetric because D(Aj) = H. Let us ﬁnd the adjoint to Aj, denoted Pj := A∗
j ,
directly from the deﬁnition. Given f ∈D(A∗
j ) = D(Pj) there must be φ ∈L2(Rn, dx)
(coinciding with Pjf by deﬁnition) such that:

Rn φ(x)g(x)dx = −iℏ

Rn f (x) ∂
∂xj
g(x)dx ,
for any g ∈D(Rn) .
(5.17)
Conjugating the equation we may rephrase (5.17) as follows: f ∈L2(Rn, dx) belongs
in D(Pj) if and only if it admits weak derivative φ ∈L2(Rn, dx).
Deﬁnition 5.27 (Momentum operator) Let H := L2(Rn, dx), dx being the Lebesgue
measure on Rn. Given j ∈{1, 2, . . . , n}, the operator on H:
(Pjf )(x) = −iℏw- ∂
∂xj
f (x) ,
(5.18)
with domain:
D(Pj) :=

Proposition 5.29 Let Pj be the momentum operator of Deﬁnition 5.27. Then

Proof To simplify notations, in the sequel we will set ℏ= 1 (absorbing the constant
ℏ−1 in the unit of measure of the coordinate xj), and denote by ∂j the jth derivative and
by w-∂j the weak derivative. We want to prove Ker(A∗
j ±iI) = {0}. This would imply,
owing to Theorem 5.19, that Aj is essentially self-adjoint, i.e. Pj = A∗
j is self-adjoint.
The space Ker(A∗
j ± iI) consists of maps f ∈L2(Rn, dx) admitting weak derivative
and such that i(w-∂jf ± f ) = 0. Let us consider the equation:
w-∂jf ± f = 0 ,
(5.22)
with f ∈L2(Rn, dx). Multiplying by an exponential gives:

So we can reduce to proving the following.
Lemma 5.30 If h : Rn →C is locally integrable and
w-∂jh = 0 ,
(5.24)
h coincides almost everywhere with a constant function in xj.
Proof of lemma 5.30. Without loss of generality we can suppose j = 1. We indicate
by (x, y) the coordinates of Rn, where x is x1 and y subsumes the remaining n −1
components. Take h locally integrable satisfying (5.24). Explicitly:

Rn h(x, y) ∂
∂x g(x, y)dx ⊗dy = 0 ,
for any g ∈D(Rn) .
(5.25)
Pick f ∈D(Rn), and choose a > 0 large, so to have supp(f ) ⊂[−a, a]×[−a, a]n−1.
Deﬁne a map χ ∈D(R) with supp(χ) = [−a, a] and

R χ(x)dx = 1. Then there is
a map g ∈D(Rn) such that
∂
∂x g(x, y) = f (x, y) −χ(x)

f (u, y)du .

This map is smooth by construction, and its x-derivative coincides with:


R
f (u, y)du .

Moreover the support of g is bounded: if some coordinate satisﬁes |yk| > a, then
f (u, y) = 0 whichever u we have, so g(x, y) = 0 for any x. If x < −a the ﬁrst
integral in (5.26) vanishes, and also the second one, for χ is supported in [−a, a].
Conversely, if x > a

h(u, y)χ(u)du
is locally integrable on Rn, because
(x, y, u) →f (x, y)h(u, y)χ(u)
is integrabile on Rn+1 for any f ∈D(Rn) (it is enough to observe |f (x, y)| ≤
|f1(x)||f2(y)| for suitable f1 in D(R) and f2 in D(Rn−1)). Equation (5.27), valid for
any f ∈D(Rn), implies immediately
h(x, y) −

R
h(u, y)χ(u)du = 0
almost everywhere on Rn by the Du Bois–Reymond Lemma 5.26. That is to say

In the case under scrutiny the result implies that every solution to (5.22) must have
the form f (x) = e±xjh(x), where h does not depend on xj. The theorem of Fubini–

j ± iI) = {0} and so
Pj = A∗
j is self-adjoint (Aj is essentially self-adjoint).
Because S (Rn) ⊃D(Rn) it is easy to see that A′

There is another way to introduce the operator Pj, using the Fourier–Plancherel
transform
ˆ
F : L2(Rn, dx) →L2(Rn, dk) seen in Sect.3.7.
We deﬁne on L2(Rn, dk) the analogue to Xj, which we call Kj (conventionally, the
target space Rn of the Fourier–Plancherel transform has coordinates (k1, . . . , kn)).
Since
ˆ
F is unitary, the operator
ˆ
F −1Kj ˆ
F is self-adjoint if deﬁned on the domain
ˆ
F −1D(Kj).
Proposition 5.31 Let Kj be the jth position operator on the target space of the
Fourier–Plancherel transform
ˆ
F : L2(Rn, dx) →L2(Rn, dk). Then
Pj = ℏˆ
F −1Kj ˆ
F .
Proof It sufﬁces to show the operators coincide on a domain where they are both
essentially self-adjoint. To this end consider S (Rn). From Sect.3.7 we know the
Fourier–Plancherel transform is the Fourier transform on this space, and
ˆ
F(S (Rn)) = S (Rn). Moreover, the properties of the Fourier transform imply

Existence and Uniqueness Criteria for Self-adjoint
Extensions
In this remaining part of the chapter we examine a few criteria to determine whether
an operator admits self-adjoint extensions, and how many. A deeper analysis on
these topics can be found in [ReSi80, vol. II], also in terms of quadratic forms, or in
[Wie80, Rud91, Tes09, Schm12].
5.4.1
The Cayley Transform and Deﬁciency Indices
One crucial technical tool is the Cayley transform, introduced below. Before that,
we generalise the notion of isometry (Deﬁnition 3.6) to operators with non-maximal
domain.
Deﬁnition 5.32 An operator U : D(U) →H, on the Hilbert space H, is an isometry
if
(Ux|Uy) = (x|y)
for any x, y ∈D(U).
Remark 5.33 (1) Clearly, if D(U) = H the above deﬁnition pins down isometric
operators in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.56.
(2) By Proposition 3.8, the above condition is the same as demanding ||Ux|| = ||x||,
for any x ∈D(U).
■
The transformation R ∋t →(t −i)(t + i)−1 ∈C is a well-known bijection
between the real line R and the unit circle in C minus the point 1. There is a similar
correspondence that maps isometric operators to symmetric operators, called the
Cayley transform.
Theorem 5.34 Let H be a Hilbert space.
(a) If A is a symmetric operator on H:
(i) A + iI is injective,

5.4 Existence and Uniqueness Criteria for Self-adjoint Extensions
271
(ii) the Cayley transform of A:
V := (A −iI)(A + iI)−1 : Ran(A + iI) →H ,
(5.28)
is a well-deﬁned operator,
(iii) V is an isometry with Ran(V ) = Ran(A −iI).
(b) If (5.28) holds for some operator A : D(A) →H with (A + iI) injective, then:
(i) I −V is injective,
(ii) Ran(I −V ) = D(A) and
A := i(I + V )(I −V )−1 .
(5.29)
(c) If A is symmetric on H, the following facts are equivalent:
(i) A is self-adjoint,
(ii) its Cayley transform V is unitary on H.
(d) If V : H →H is unitary and I −V injective, then V is the Cayley transform of
some self-adjoint operator on H.
Proof (a) A direct computation using the symmetry of A and the linearity of inner
products proves that
||(A ± iI)f ||2 = ||Af ||2 + ||f ||2
(5.30)
if f ∈D(A). Therefore if (A + iI)f = 0 or (A −iI)f = 0 then f = 0. The
operators A±iI are therefore injective on D(A), turning V into an operator D(V ) :=
Ran(A + iI) →H. From (5.30)
||(A −iI)g|| = ||(A + iI)g||
for any g ∈D(A). Set g = (A + iI)−1h, with h ∈Ran(A + iI). Then
||V h|| = ||(A −iI)(A + iI)−1h|| = ||h|| ,
so V is an isometry with domain D(V ) = Ran(A+iI) and range Ran(V ) = Ran(A−
iI).
(b) The domain D(V ) consists of vectors g = (A + iI)f with f ∈D(A). Applying V
to g gives Vg = (A −iI)f . Adding and subtracting g = (A + iI)f produces
(I + V )g = 2Af ,
(5.31)
(I −V )g = 2if .
(5.32)
Now, (5.32) tells (I −V ) is injective, for if (I −V )g = 0 then f = 0 and so
g = (A + iI)f = 0. Therefore if f ∈D(A) we can write

272
5
Densely-Deﬁned Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
g = 2i(I −V )−1f .
(5.33)
Furthermore, Ran(I−V ) = D(A) follows immediately from (5.32). Applying (I+V )
to Eq. (5.33) and using (5.31):
Af = i(I + V )(I −V )−1f
for any f ∈D(A).
(c) Suppose A = A∗. By Theorem 5.18 Ran(A + iI) = Ran(A −iI) = H. Then part
(a) implies V is an isometry from Ran(A + iI) = H onto H = Ran(A −iI). Hence
V is a surjective isometry, i.e. a unitary operator.
Suppose now V : H →H is the unitary Cayley transform of a symmetric operator
A on H. By part (a) Ran(A+iI) = Ran(A−iI) = H. This means A = A∗by Theorem
5.18.
(d) It is enough to prove V is the Cayley transform of a symmetric operator. By
part (c) this symmetric operator is self-adjoint. By assumption there is a bijective
map z →x, from D(V ) = H to Ran(I −V ), given by x := z −V z. Deﬁne
A : Ran(I −V ) →H as
Ax := i(z + V z) ,
ifx = z −V z.
(5.34)
By taking x, y ∈D(A) = Ran(I −V ) we have x = z −V z and y = u −V u for some
z, u ∈D(V ). But V is an isometry, so
(Ax|y) = i(z + V z|u −V u) = i(V z|u) −i(z|V u) = (z −V z|iu −iV u) = (x|Ay) ,
and A is Hermitian. To show it is symmetric, note D(A) = Ran(I −V ) is dense. In
fact [Ran(I −V )]⊥= Ker(I −V ∗). If Ker(I −V ∗) were not {0}, there would exist a
non-zero vector u ∈H such that V ∗u = u, and then applying V would give u = V u.
But that is not possible, for I −V is injective by assumption.
To ﬁnish, we prove V is the Cayley transform of A. Equation (5.34) reads:
2iV z = Ax −ix ,
2iz = Ax + ix ,
if z ∈H.
(5.35)
Hence V (Ax + ix) = Ax −ix for x ∈D(A) and H = D(V ) = Ran(A + iI). But then
V is the Cayley transform of A because V (A + iI) = A −iI, and so
V = (A −iI)(A + iI)−1 .
This ends the proof.
⊓⊔
Remark 5.35 From the statement and proof we infer that Ker(A ± iI) = {0} if A is
symmetric. The further condition Ker(A∗± iI) = {0} is very restrictive, equivalent
to the essential self-adjointness of A (if A is symmetric) by Theorem 5.19.
■
Before we pass to the consequences of Theorem 5.34 concerning the existence
of self-adjoint extensions of a symmetric operator, let us make a general remark.

5.4 Existence and Uniqueness Criteria for Self-adjoint Extensions
273
Other textbooks that discuss these issues suppose the symmetric operator A be also
closed. We shall not make that hypothesis, because the (differential) operators typi-
cally handled in practical computations of QM are symmetric but not closed. Besides,
imposing closure from the start is not that essential, in view of the following elemen-
tary result.
Proposition 5.36 If A is symmetric, then A is symmetric, and B is a self-adjoint
extension of A if and only if it is a self-adjoint extension of A.
Proof By direct inspection, one sees that A symmetric ⇒A symmetric (see the
solutions of Exercises 5.7 and 5.8). A self-adjoint operator is closed because an
adjoint operator is always closed. If B = B∗extends A, then B is a closed extension
of A so that A ⊂B, since A is the smallest closed extension of A. The converse is
trivial: if B is self-adjoint and B ⊃A then B ⊃A ⊃A.
⊓⊔
The ﬁrst result we introduce is about deﬁciency indices. If A is a symmetric
operator on the Hilbert space H, we call
d±(A) := dim Ker(A∗± iI)
the deﬁciency indices of A. They can be deﬁned equivalently as:
d±(A) := dim [Ran(A ∓iI)]⊥,
because Ker(A∗± iI) = [Ran(A ∓iI)]⊥. Furthermore, the deﬁciency indices of the
symmetric operator A and those of A coincide, and more strongly we have
Ker(A∗± iI) = Ker(A
∗± iI) .
In fact, since A = A∗∗and A∗= A∗∗∗due to Proposition 5.17(a), and because
(B + aI)∗= B∗+ aI and B + aI = B + aI for densely-deﬁned, closable operators
B (as one immediately proves), then A and A have the same adjoint.
Theorem 5.37 If A is a symmetric operator on the Hilbert space H, the following
facts hold.
(a) A admits self-adjoint extensions ⇔d+(A) = d−(A).
(b) If d+(A) = d−(A), there is a 1-1 correspondence
U0 : Ker(A∗−iI) →Ker(A∗+ iI)
between self-adjoint extensions of A and surjective isometries.
In particular, A admits more than one self-adjoint extension whenever d+(A) =
d−(A) > 0.
As a matter of fact, the domain of the self-adjoint extension AU0 is
D(AU0) = D(A) + (I −U0)(Ker(A∗−iI)) ,
(5.36)

274
5
Densely-Deﬁned Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
where the sum is direct (but not orthogonal in general). Furthermore, AU0 acts by
AU0z = Ax + i(I + U0)y ,
(5.37)
for z = x + (I + U0)y with x ∈D(A) and y ∈Ker(A∗−iI),
Proof (a) Consider the Cayley transform V of A. Suppose A has a self-adjoint exten-
sion B and let U : H →H be the Cayley transform of B. It is straightforward to
see U is an extension of V using (5.28), recalling (B + iI)−1 extends (A + iI)−1 and
B −iI extends A −iI. Hence U maps Ran(A + iI) to Ran(A −iI). As U is unitary,
y ⊥Ran(A + iI) ⇔Uy ⊥U(Ran(A + iI)), that is to say U([Ran(A + iI)]⊥) =
[Ran(A −iI)]⊥. By Theorem 5.10(c) this means U(Ker(A∗+ iI)) = Ker(A∗−iI).
Since U is an isometry, dim Ker(A∗+ iI) = dim Ker(A∗−iI), i.e. d+(A) = d−(A).
(b) Let us show, conversely, that if d+(A) = d−(A) then A has a self-adjoint
extension, not unique in case d+(A) = d−(A) > 0. The Cayley transform V of
A is bounded, so Proposition 2.47 says we can extend it, uniquely, to an isometric
operator U : Ran(A + iI) →Ran(A −iI). The same we can do for V −1, extending
it to a unique isometry Ran(A −iI) →Ran(A + iI). By continuity this operator is
U −1 : Ran(A −iI) →Ran(A + iI). Now recall Ran(A ± iI)
⊥= [Ran(A ± iI)]⊥=
Ker(A∗∓iI). Having assumed d+(A) = d−(A), we can deﬁne a unitary operator
U0 : Ker(A∗−iI) →Ker(A∗+ iI) .
Since
H = Ran(A + iI) ⊕Ker(A∗−iI) = Ran(A −iI) ⊕Ker(A∗+ iI)
is an orthogonal decomposition by closed spaces,
W := U ⊕U0 : (x, y) →(Ux, U0y) ,
with x ∈Ran(A + iI) and y ∈Ker(A∗−iI) ,
is a unitary operator on H. Moreover I −W is injective. In fact, Ker(I −W) consists
of pairs (x, y) ̸= (0, 0) with Ux = x and U0y = y: the ﬁrst condition has only
the solution x = 0 because U is an isometry, and the second one implies y ∈
Ker(A∗+ iI) ∩Ker(A∗−iI), giving y = 0. Therefore Theorem 5.34(d) applies,
and W is the Cayley transform of a self-adjoint operator B. As W extends U, B is a
self-adjoint extension of A.
We now claim that the correspondence between self-adjoint extensions of A
and surjective isometries U0 is bijective. First of all we must prove that every
self-adjoint extension is constructed out of a surjective isometry U0. If, as above,
U : Ran(A + iI) →Ran(A −iI) denotes the unique unitary extension of the Cayley
transform V of A, each self-adjoint extension B of A has a unitary Cayley transform
W extending U to a unitary operator on the whole Hilbert space H. Since

5.4 Existence and Uniqueness Criteria for Self-adjoint Extensions
275
H = Ran(A + iI) ⊕Ker(A∗−iI) = Ran(A −iI) ⊕Ker(A∗+ iI) ,
and W extends U, the only possibility is that W determines a surjective isometry
U0 : Ker(A∗−iI) →Ker(A∗+ iI). Therefore B is determined by U0. Let us prove
that the correspondence B →U0 is one-to-one. Two distinct self-adjoint extensions
B, B′ give distinct operators U0,U ′
0, otherwise the Cayley transforms W, W ′ would
coincide. But Theorem 5.34(a, b) tells that two symmetric operators are distinct iff
their Cayley transforms differ. The map is also onto by what we said above, because
the choice of U0 determines a self-adjoint extension of A, i.e., the one with Cayley
transform W := U ⊕U0.
There are many choices for U0 if d+(A) = d−(A) > 0, and each one produces a
different self-adjoint extension of A.
We conclude the proof by showing (5.36) and (5.37). First assume that A is
symmetric and closed. In this case Ran(A ± iI) = Ran(A ± iI) (since A ± iI is
also closed, (A ± iI)−1 is bounded and by the deﬁnition of closed operator in
terms of sequences), so V = U. Denote by AU0 the self-adjoint extension con-
structed out of U0, and by WU0 = V ⊕U0 its Cayley transform. Using the splitting
H = Ran(A + iI) ⊕Ker(A∗−iI), from (ii) in Theorem 5.34(b) we have
D(AU0) = Ran(I −WU0) = Ran(I + V ) + (I −U0)Ker(A∗−iI) ,
that is
D(AU0) = D(A) + (I −U0)(Ker(A∗−iI)) .
We claim that this is a direct sum. Suppose x + (I −U0)y = 0 with x ∈D(A) and
y ∈Ker(A∗−iI),sothatU0y ∈Ker(A∗+iI).Wewanttoprovethatx = (I−U0)y = 0.
Indeed, applying A∗to x + y −U0y = 0 and noticing that A∗⊃A, we have
0 = A∗x + A∗y −A∗U0y = Ax + (A∗−iI)y + (A∗+ iI)U0y + iy −iU0 = Ax + iy −iU0y .
Comparing the result with x + y −U0y = 0 we ﬁnd (A −iI)x = 0 which, in turn,
implies x = 0 because A −iI is injective since A is symmetric. As a consequence
(I −U0)y = 0, as required.
Let us prove (5.37) to conclude the proof for A symmetric and closed. In accor-
dance with (5.36), take D(AU0) ∋z = x + (I −U0)y with x ∈D(A) and
y ∈Ker(A∗−iI). Then
AU0z = i(I + WU0)(I −WU0)−1z = i(I + V )(I −V )−1x + i(I + U0)(I −U0)−1(I −U0)y ,
that is
AU0z = Ax + i(I + U0)y ,
which is (5.37).

Densely-Deﬁned Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
Eventually, observe that (5.36), (5.37) are also valid for A symmetric with A ⊊A,
since the self-adjoint extensions of A and A coincide and Ker(A∗± iI) = Ker
(A
∗± iI).
⊓⊔
Next comes the ﬁrst important corollary to Theorem 5.37.
Theorem 5.38 A symmetric operator A on the Hilbert space H is essentially self-
adjoint if and only if it admits a unique self-adjoint extension.
Proof If A is essentially self-adjoint it has a unique self-adjoint extension by Propo-
sition 5.17(d). Theorem 5.37 implies that a symmetric operator A has self-adjoint
extensions only if d+ = d−. In particular, if the extension is unique d+ = d−= 0.
But then Theorem 5.19(b) forces A to be essentially self-adjoint.
⊓⊔
5.4.2
Von Neumann’s Criterion
Another consequence of Theorem 5.34, proved by von Neumann, establishes sufﬁ-
cient conditions for a symmetric operator to admit self-adjoint extensions. First we
need two deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 5.39 Let X and X′ be C-vector spaces with Hermitian inner products
( | )X and ( | )X′ respectively. A surjective map V : X →X′ is an anti-unitary
operator if:
(a) V is antilinear: V (αx + βy) = αV x + βV y for any x, y ∈X, α, β ∈C;
(b) V is anti-isometric: (V x|V y)X′ = (x|y)X for any x, y ∈X.
Remark 5.40 Despite the complex conjugation in (b), note that ||V z||X′ = ||z||X for
any z ∈X. Moreover, V is bijective.
■
Deﬁnition 5.41 If (H, ( | )) is a Hilbert space, an anti-unitary operator C : H →H
is called a conjugation operator, or just conjugation, if it is involutive, i.e. CC = I.
Remark 5.42 ConjugationsaredeﬁnedonHermitianinnerproductspaces.Ingeneral
they differ from involutions in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.40, as the latter are deﬁned
on algebras.
■
Theorem 5.43 (Von Neumann’s criterion) Let A be a symmetric operator on the
Hilbert space H. If there exists a conjugation C : H →H such that
CA ⊂AC ,
then A admits self-adjoint extensions.

5.4 Existence and Uniqueness Criteria for Self-adjoint Extensions
277
Proof To begin with, let us show C(D(A∗)) ⊂D(A∗) and CA∗⊂A∗C. By deﬁnition
of adjoint (A∗f |Cg) = (f |ACg) for any f ∈D(A∗) and g ∈D(A). As C is anti-
unitary, (CCg|CA∗f ) = (CACg|Cf ). As C commutes with A and CC = I, we have
(g|CA∗f ) = (Ag|Cf )), i.e. (CA∗f |g) = (Cf |Ag) for any f ∈D(A∗) and g ∈D(A).
By deﬁnition of adjoint, this means Cf ∈D(A∗) if f ∈D(A∗) and CA∗f = A∗Cf .
Let us pass to the existence, using Theorem 5.37. According to what we have just
proved, if A∗f = if , applying C and using that C is antilinear and commutes with
A∗, we obtain A∗Cf = −iCf . Thus C is a map (injective because it preserves norms)
from Ker(A∗−iI) to Ker(A∗+iI). It is also onto, for if A∗g = −ig, picking f := Cg
we have A∗f = +if . Applying C to f again (recall CC = I) gives Cf = g. Therefore
C is a bijection Ker(A∗−iI) →Ker(A∗+ iI). That it is also anti-isometric, i.e. it
preserves orthonormal vectors, implies it must map bases to bases. In particular it
preserves their cardinality, so d+(A) = d−(A). The claim now follows from Theorem
5.37.

Nelson’s Criterion
We present, in conclusion, Nelson’s criterion, which provides sufﬁcient conditions
for a symmetric operator to be essentially self-adjoint. Although we will be able to
appreciate the theorem in full only after delving into spectral theory (Chaps.8 and
9), we believe it is better to present the result at this juncture. The reader might want
to postpone the proof until he becomes familiar with the material of those chapters.
First, though, a few preliminaries are in order.
Deﬁnition 5.44 Let A be an operator on the Hilbert space H.
(a) A vector ψ ∈D(A) such that Anψ ∈D(A) for any n ∈N (A0 := I) is called a
C∞vector for A, and we denote by C∞(A) the subspace of C∞vectors for A.
(b) A vector ψ ∈C∞(A) is an analytic vector for A if:
+∞

n=0
||Anψ||
n!
tn < +∞for some t > 0.
(d) A vector ψ ∈C∞(A) is a vector of uniqueness for A if A ↾Dψ is an essentially
self-adjoint operator on the Hilbert space Hψ := Dψ, where Dψ ⊂H is the span of
Anψ, n = 0, 1, 2 . . .
We shall come back to analytic vectors more extensively in Sect.9.2. Here we will
just introduce some results towards Nelson’s criterion. If ψ is an analytic vector for
A, the series:

easily proved, that comes from using the triangle inequality and the norm’s homo-
geneity repeatedly (the details will appear in the proof of Proposition 9.25(f)).
Proposition 5.45 If ψ is an analytic vector for an operator A on the Hilbert space
H, every vector in Dψ is analytic for A. More precisely, if the series

converges for t > 0 and φ ∈Dψ, then
+∞

n=0
||Anφ||

We have a proposition, called Nussbaum lemma.
Proposition 5.46 (“Nussbaum lemma”)
Let A be a symmetric operator on the
Hilbert space H. If D(A) contains a set of vectors of uniqueness whose linear span
is dense in H, A is essentially self-adjoint.
Proof By Theorem 5.19 it is enough to prove the spaces Ran(A ± iI) are dense.
With our assumptions, given φ ∈H and ε > 0, there is a ﬁnite linear combination
of vectors of uniqueness ψi with ||φ −N
i=1 αiψi|| < ε/2. Since ψi ∈Hψ and
A ↾Dψ is essentially self-adjoint on this Hilbert space, Theorem 5.19(c) implies there
exist vectors ηi ∈Hψ with ||(A ↾Dψ +iI)ηi −ψi|| ≤ε/2

. Setting
η := N
i=1 αiηi and ψ := N
i=1 αiψi, we have η ∈D(A) and
||(A + iI)η −φ|| ≤||(A ↾Dψ +iI)η −ψ|| + ||φ −ψ|| < ε .

5.4 Existence and Uniqueness Criteria for Self-adjoint Extensions
279
But ε > 0 is arbitrary, so Ran(A + iI) is dense. The claim about Ran(A −iI) is
similar. So, A is essentially self-adjoint by Theorem 5.19(c).
⊓⊔
The above result prepares the ground for the proof of Nelson’s ‘analytic-vector
theorem’. As we mentioned, the proof needs the spectral theory of unbounded self-
adjoint operators (which is logically independent from the criterion, albeit presented
in Chaps.8 and 9).
Theorem 5.47 (Nelson’s criterion) Let A be a symmetric operator on the Hilbert
space H. If D(A) contains a set of analytic vectors for A whose span is dense in H,
A is essentially self-adjoint.
Proof By Proposition 5.46 it sufﬁces to show that an analytic vector ψ0 for A is a
vectorofuniquenessforA.NoteA ↾Dψ0 issurelyasymmetricoperatoronHψ0 := Dψ0,
because it is Hermitian and its domain is dense in Hψ0. Suppose A ↾Dψ0 has a self-
adjoint extension B in Hψ0. (NB: we are talking about self-adjoint extensions of
A ↾Dψ0 on the Hilbert space Hψ0, and not on H!) Let μψ be the spectral measure of
ψ ∈Dψ0 for the PVM of the spectral expansion of B (cf. Theorems 8.52 (c) and
9.13), deﬁned by μψ(E) := (ψ|P(B)
E ψ) for any Borel set E ⊂σ(B) ⊂R, where P(B)
E
is the PVM associated to the self-adjoint operator B. As ψ0 is analytic

In particular, if ψ ∈Dψ0, this happens if z = it (with |t| < t0) because the domain

(5.38)
(Note the power series on the right converges on an open disc of radius t0, i.e. it
deﬁnes an analytic extension of the function on the left when it is replaced by z in
the disc, even if ψ does not belong to the domain of ezB.) Now consider another
self-adjoint extension of ADψ0 , say B′. Arguing as before, for |t| < t0 we have
(ψ|eitB′ψ) =
+∞

n=0
(it)n
n! (ψ|Anψ) .
(5.39)
Then (5.38) and (5.39) imply, for any |t| < t0 and any ψ ∈Dψ0,
(ψ|(eitB −eitB′)ψ) = 0 .
But Dψ0 is dense in Hψ0, so (cf. Exercise 3.21) for any |t| < t0:
eitB = eitB′ .
Compute the strong derivatives at t = 0 and invoke Stone’s theorem (Theorem 9.33),
to the effect that
B = B′ .
Therefore all possible self-adjoint extensions of A ↾Dψ are the same. We claim there
exists at least one. Deﬁne C : Dψ0 →Hψ0 by
C :

5.4 Existence and Uniqueness Criteria for Self-adjoint Extensions
281
Easily C extends to a unique conjugation operator on Hψ0, which we still call C (see
Exercise 5.17). What is more, by construction CA ↾Dψ0 = A ↾Dψ0 C, so A ↾Dψ0 admits
self-adjoint extensions by Theorem 5.43.
Altogether, for any analytic vector ψ0, A ↾Dψ0 must be essentially self-adjoint on
Hψ0 by Theorem 5.38, because it is symmetric and it admits precisely one self-adjoint
extension. We have thus proved that any analytic vector ψ0 is a vector of uniqueness,
ending the proof.
⊓⊔
Examples 5.48 (1) A standard example to which von Neumann’s criterion applies
is an operator of chief importance in QM, namely H := −Δ + V , where Δ is the
usual Laplacian on Rn
Δ :=
n

i=1
∂2
∂x2
i
,
and V is a locally integrable real-valued function.
By setting the domain of H to be D(Rn), H becomes immediately a symmetric oper-
ator on L2(Rn, dx). Deﬁne C as the anti-unitary operator mapping f ∈L2(Rn, dx) to
its pointwise-conjugate function. Clearly CH = HC, so H admits self-adjoint exten-
sions. By choosing a speciﬁc V it is possible to prove H is essentially self-adjoint,
as we will see at the end of Chap.10.
(2) We know the operator Ai := −i ∂
∂xi on D(Rn) (see Proposition 5.29) is essentially
self-adjoint, and as such it admits self-adjoint extensions. Is there a conjugation C
that commutes with Ai? (The issue is moot, as such a C it might not exist). The con-
jugation operator of (1) does not commute with Ai despite its invariant subspace is
the domain. Another possibility is C : L2(Rn, dx) →L2(Rn, dx), (Cf )(x) := f (−x)
(almost everywhere) for any f ∈L2(Rn, dx). It is not hard to see C(D(Rn)) ⊂D(Rn)
and CAi = AiC.
(3) Consider the Hilbert space H := L2([0, 1], dx) with Lebesgue measure dx. Take
the operator A := i d
dx acting on functions in C1([0, 1]) (i.e. maps f ∈C1((0, 1)) that
are continuous on [0, 1] and whose ﬁrst derivative has ﬁnite limit at 0, 1) that further
vanish at 0 and 1. The operator is Hermitian, as can be seen integrating by parts
and because the maps annihilate boundary terms, so they vanish at the endpoints of
the integral. One can also verify the domain of A is dense, making A symmetric.
Let us show A is not essentially self-adjoint. The condition that g ∈D(A∗) satisﬁes
A∗g = ig (resp. A∗g = −ig) reads:
 1
0
g(x)

f ′(x) + f (x)

dx = 0
(resp.
 1
0 g(x)

f ′(x) −f (x)

dx = 0) for any f ∈D(A). Integrating by parts shows
that the L2 map g(x) = ex (g(x) = e−x) solves the above equation for any f in
C1([0, 1]) that vanishes at 0, 1. This latter fact is crucial when integrating by parts,

282
5
Densely-Deﬁned Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
because the exponential does not vanish at 0 and 1. Theorem 5.19 says A cannot be
essentially self-adjoint.
Theorem 5.43 warrants, nonetheless, the existence of self-adjoint extensions. The
antilinear transformation C : L2([0, 1], dx) →L2([0, 1], dx), (Cf )(x) := f (1 −x)
maps the space of C1 functions on [0, 1] vanishing at the endpoints to itself. In
addition

Ci d
dx f

(x) = −i
d
d(1 −x)f (1 −x) = i d
dx f (1 −x) = i d
dx (Cf )(x) ,
whence CA = AC. There must be more than one such extension, otherwise A would
be essentially self-adjoint by Theorem 5.37, a contradiction.
The argument does not change if one takes domains akin to the above, in particular
the space of C∞maps on [0, 1] that vanish at 0 and 1, or smooth maps on [0, 1] with
compact support in (0, 1).
(4) Take H := L2([0, 1], dx) with the usual Lebesgue measure dx, and consider
A := −i d
dx deﬁned on smooth periodic maps on [0, 1] with periodic derivatives
of any order (of period 1). Integration by parts reveals that A is Hermitian. The
exponential maps en(x) := ei2πnx, x ∈[0, 1], n ∈Z, form a basis of H, as shown in
Exercise 3.32(1). They are all deﬁned on D(A), and their span is dense in H, so D(A)
is dense in H and A is symmetric.
Anyf ∈Hcorresponds1-1tothesequenceofFouriercoefﬁcients{fn}n∈Z ⊂ℓ2(Z)
of the expansion
f =

n∈Z
fnen .
This deﬁnes a unitary operator U : H →ℓ2(Z), f →{fn}n∈Z (see Theorem 3.28).
The elementary theory of Fourier series tells that UD(A)U −1 =: D(A′) is the space
of sequences {fn} in ℓ2(Z) such that nN|fn| →0, n →+∞, for any N ∈N. Moreover,
if A′ := UAU −1 and {fn}n∈Z ∈D(A′), then
A′ : {fn}n∈Z →{2πnfn}n∈Z .
Replicating the argument used for Xi in the proof of Proposition 5.23 allows to arrive

On this domain

As in Proposition 5.23, we can verify without problems that the adjoint to A′∗is
A′∗itself. Hence A′∗is self-adjoint and A′ essentially self-adjoint. As U is unitary,

5.4 Existence and Uniqueness Criteria for Self-adjoint Extensions
283
also A is essentially self-adjoint and the unique self-adjoint extension A satisﬁes
A = UA′U −1. (Fill in all details as exercise.)
(5) Example (4) can be settled in a much quicker way using Nelson’s criterion. The
domain of A contains the functions en, whose span is dense in H := L2([0, 1], dx).
Moreover Aen = 2πnen. Then

(t)k = e2π|n|t < +∞,
for any t > 0. As a consequence, A is essentially self-adjoint.
(6) Let us go back again to example (4), this time using Theorem 5.37 (for more
details see [ReSi80, vol. II] and [Tes09]). For the sake of computational simplicity
we replace [0, 1] by [0, 2π]. Referring to the Hilbert space L2([0, 2π], dx), consider
the operator A := −i d
dx with domain
D(A) =

ψ : [0, 2π] →C
 ψ ∈C1([0, 2π]) , ψ(0) = ψ(1) = 0

where ψ ∈C1([0, 2π]) means that both ψ and dψ
dx (with the derivatives at the
boundary of [0, 2π] deﬁned by limits) are continuous. Observe that D(A) is dense in
L2([0, 2π], dx) (because it contains the dense space of smooth, compactly supported
functions) and, by direct inspection, A is symmetric. Then D(A∗) turns out to be the
subspace of L2([0, 2π], dx)
D(A∗) =

ψ ∈C([0, 2π])
 ∃w-dψ
dx ∈L2([0, 2π], dx)

.
Equivalently, ψ ∈D(A∗) if and only if ψ is absolutely continuous (Deﬁnition 1.74
and Theorem 1.76) and its derivative (deﬁned a.e.) belongs to L2([0, 2π], dx) (see
[Tes09]). The derivative coincides with the weak derivative w- dψ
dx and, obviously,
A∗ψ = −iw- dψ
dx . The analysis of Ker(A∗± iI) proves that, as expected, these spaces
are one-dimensional and Ker(A∗± iI) is the span of e±x. So on the one hand A is not
essentially self-adjoint, and hence it does not determine (precisely) one self-adjoint
operator. On the other hand it admits an inﬁnite family of self-adjoint extensions
because d+(A) = d−(A) = 1.
The unitary operators Ker(A∗−iI) →Ker(A∗+iI) are completely and faithfully
labelled by the parameter θ ∈[0, 2π) and act in this way
Uθ : e2πe−x →eiθex
(the factor e2π makes both sides have the same L2-norm

2−1(e4π −1), as due).
Denoting by Aθ the self-adjoint extension of A associated with Uθ, according to
(5.36), fθ ∈D(Aθ) iff

284
5
Densely-Deﬁned Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
fθ(x) = f (x) + α(e2π−x −eiθex)
(5.40)
for some α ∈C and f ∈D(A), where it is possible to prove that
D(A) =

ψ ∈C([0, 2π])
 ψ(2π) = ψ(0) = 0 , w-dψ
dx ∈L2([0, 2π], dx)

.
Equivalently, ψ ∈D(A) ⇔ψ is absolutely continuous, its derivative (deﬁned a.e.)
belongs to L2([0, 2π], dx) and ψ vanishes at the boundary of [0, 2π]. Since f in
(5.40) vanishes at 0 and 2π, the value attained by the generic fθ ∈D(Aθ) at 0, 2π is
determined by the second summand in (5.40):
fθ(2π) = eiθ′fθ(0) ,
eiθ′ = 1 −eiθe2π
e2π −eiθ .
(5.41)
It easy to see that θ′ ranges over the whole [0, 2π) when θ ∈[0, 2π). In other words,
the choice of a self-adjoint extension of A relaxes the boundary conditions of the
functions on which it acts, as a glance at
D(Aθ) =

ψ ∈C([0, 2π])
 ψ(2π) = eiθ′ψ(0) , w-dψ
dx ∈L2([0, 2π], dx)

and D(A) (or D(A)) conﬁrms. We may also phrase the condition ψ ∈D(Aθ) by
demanding that ψ is absolutely continuous, its derivative (deﬁned a.e.) belongs
to L2([0, 2π], dx) and it satisﬁes the almost-periodic boundary conditions written
above. A nice physical analysis of the self-adjoint extensions of −i d
dx on the interval
[a, b] appears in [ReSi80, vol. II].

5.1 Let B be a closable operator on the Hilbert space H with dense domain D(B).
Prove that Ran(B) = Ran(B) and therefore Ker(B∗) = Ker(B
∗).
Solution. If y ∈Ran(B), there is a sequence of elements xn ∈D(B) such that
xn →x ∈H and Bxn →y, so y ∈Ran(B). Hence Ran(B) ⊂Ran(B). Since B ⊂B
we ﬁnally conclude that: Ran(B) ⊂Ran(B) ⊂Ran(B). Taking again the closure:
Ran(B) ⊂Ran(B) ⊂Ran(B), so that Ran(B) = Ran(B). Eventually: Ker(B∗) =

Solution. If A is symmetric so is A−1 : H →D(A). The latter is deﬁned on the
whole Hilbert space, so it is self-adjoint. Its inverse will, in turn, be self-adjoint.

Hint. The operator Δ is symmetric on S (Rn), so we can use Theorem 5.19,
verifying condition (b). Since the Schwartz space is invariant under the action of the
unitary operator 
F given by the Fourier–Plancherel transform, as seen in Sect.3.7,
we may consider Theorem 5.19(b) for 
Δ := 
FΔ 
F −1. This operator is essentially
self-adjoint on S (R3) iff Δ is deﬁned on S (R3). Now, 
Δ acts on S (Rn) by mul-
tiplication by −k2 = −(k2

n), giving a self-adjoint operator on the
aforementioned standard domain. Condition (b) can then be veriﬁed easily for 
Δ∗,
by using the deﬁnition of adjoint plus the fact that S (Rn) ⊃D(Rn). The uniqueness
of self-adjoint extensions for essentially self-adjoint operators proves the last part,
because 
F is unitary.

if ψ ∈D((Δ ↾D(Rn))∗) then (Δϕ|ψ) = (ϕ|ψ′), with ψ′ = (Δ ↾D(Rn))∗ψ ∈

suppose, conversely, ψ ∈D(Δ). Using the Fourier–Plancherel transform gives

Phenomenology of Quantum Systems and
Wave Mechanics: An Overview
Two are the possible outcomes: if the result conﬁrms the
hypotheses, you only took a measurement. But if the result
contradicts the assumptions, then you made a discovery.
Enrico Fermi
In this chapter we shall present a circle of ideas aiming at understanding the mean-
ing of quantum systems and quantum phenomenology. The more mathematically-
oriented reader, perhaps not so interested in the genesis of QM notions in physics,
may skip the sections following the ﬁrst. Starting from sections two, in fact, we
address a number of experimental facts, and brieﬂy review the theoretical “proto-
quantum” methods that led to the formulation of Wave Mechanics ﬁrst, and then
to proper QM. Many of the physics details can be found in [Mes99, CCP82]. We
shall eschew discussing important steps in this historical development, e.g. atomic
spectroscopy,themodelsoftheatom(Rutherford’s,Bohr’s,Bohr–Sommerfeld’s),the
Franck–Hertz experiment, for which we recommend physics textbooks (e.g. [Mes99,
CCP82]). This overview is meant to shed light on the basic theoretical model behind
QM, which will be fully developed in ensuing chapters.
Notation 6.1 As is customary in physics texts, in this chapter, and possibly others
too, we will denote vectors in three-space (identiﬁed with R3 once Cartesian coor-
dinates have been ﬁxed in a frame system), by boldface letters, e.g. x. In the same
way, Lebesgue’s measure on R3 will be written d3x.

Phenomenology of Quantum Systems and Wave Mechanics: An Overview
6.1
General Principles of Quantum Systems
We use the term physical system loosely, as a manner of speaking. It is quite hard
to deﬁne, from a physical point of view, what a quantum system actually is. We can
start by saying that rather than talking of a physical quantum state it may be more
suitable to discuss a physical system with quantum behaviour, thus distinguishing
these systems more by their phenomenological/experimental aspects than by theo-
retical ones. Within the theoretical formulation of QM there is no clear borderline
separating classical systems from quantum systems. The divide is forced artiﬁcially;
demarcation issues are very debated, today more than in the past, and the object of
intense theoretical and experimental research work.
Generically speaking we can talk of quantum nature for microphysical systems,
i.e. molecules, atoms, nuclei and subatomic particles when taken singularly or in
small numbers. Physical systems made of several copies of those subsystems (like
crystals) can display a quantum behaviour. Certain macroscopic systems behave in
a typical quantum fashion only under speciﬁc circumstances that are hard to achieve
(e.g. Bose-Einstein condensates, or L.A.S.E.R.). There is a way to reﬁne slightly the
roughdistinctionbetweentheabovemicro-andmacrosystems.Wemaysaythatwhen
any physical system behaves in a quantum manner, the system’s characteristic action,
i.e. the number of physical dimensions of energy × time (equivalently, momentum
× length or angular momentum), obtained by combining suitably the characteristic
physical dimensions (mass, speed, length,…) in the processes examined, is of order
smaller than Planck’s constant:
h = 6.6262 · 10−34 Js.
Planck’s constant, and the word quantum stamped on Quantum Mechanics, were
ﬁrst introduced by Planck in a 1900 work on the black-body theory: this dealt with
the issue of the theoretically-inﬁnite total energy of a physical system consisting of
the electromagnetic radiation in thermodynamical equilibrium with the walls of an
enclosure at ﬁxed temperature. Planck’s theoretical prediction, later proved to be
correct, was that the radiation could exchange with the walls quantities of energy
proportional to the frequencies of the atomic oscillators inside the walls, whose
universal factor is the Planck constant. These packets of energy were called by the
Latin name quanta. But let us return to the criterion for distinguishing quantum from
classical systems using h, and look for instance at an electron orbiting around a
hydrogen nucleus. A characteristic action of the electron is, for example, the product
of its mass (∼9 · 10−31 Kg), the estimated orbiting speed (∼106 m/s) and the value
of Bohr’s radius for the hydrogen atom (∼5 · 10−11 m). This gives 4.5 · 10−35 Js,
smaller than Planck’s constant. One would therefore expect the hydrogen electron
behaved in a quantum manner, and this is indeed the case. A similar computation can
be carried out for macroscopic systems like a pendulum, of mass a few grams and
length one centimetre, swinging under gravity’s pull. A characteristic action for this

6.1 General Principles of Quantum Systems
291
can be the maximum kinetic energy times the period of oscillation, which is several
orders of magnitude bigger than h.
Remark 6.2 The set of values taken by physical quantities, like energy, that char-
acterise a quantum systems’s state is called the spectrum, in the jargon. One of the
peculiarities of quantum systems is that their spectrum is usually quite dissimilar to
the spectrum measured on comparable macroscopic systems. Sometimes the differ-
ence is astonishing, for one passes from a continuous spectrum of possible values
in the classical case, to a discrete spectrum in quantum situations. It is important
to point out that in QM it is not essential for a given physical quantity to have a
discrete spectrum: there are quantum quantities in QM with a continuous spectrum.
This misunderstanding is the cause – or the consequence, at times – of a recurrent
oversimpliﬁed interpretation of the word quantum in QM.

6.2
Particle Aspects of Electromagnetic Waves
Under special experimental circumstances electromagnetic waves, hence light as
well, reveal a behaviour that is typical of collections of particles. The mathematical
description of these anomalies (from a classical viewpoint) involves Planck’s con-
stant. In this respect we can cite two examples of classically deviant behaviour: the
photoelectric effect and Compton’s effect. In the infant stages of the development of
QM these played a fundamental role in the construction of the proto-quantum models
meant to explain them.
6.2.1
The Photoelectric Effect
The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons (a current) by a metal irradiated
with an electromagnetic wave, a phenomenon known since the ﬁrst half of the XIX
century. Some of its features remained with no explanation within the classical theory
of interactions between matter and electromagnetic waves for a long time [Mes99,
CCP82]. One conundrum, in particular, was to make sense of a threshold beaming
frequencybelowwhichnoemissioncouldbemeasured.Thisminimumvaluedepends
on the metal employed. At the time it did not seem possible to explain why the
emission started instantaneously once that particular frequency was exceeded.
According to the classical theory, an electronic emission should be detected inde-
pendently of the frequency used, as long as enough time lapses for the metal’s elec-
trons to absorb sufﬁcient energy to bond with atoms.
In 1905 A. Einstein proposed a very daring model to account for the strange prop-
erties of the photoelectric effect.1 Compared to the experimental data, the precision
1Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.

Phenomenology of Quantum Systems and Wave Mechanics: An Overview
of his predictions was outstanding. Following Planck, Einstein’s point was that a
monochromatic electromagnetic wave, i.e. one with ﬁxed frequency ν, was in reality
made of particles of matter, called light quanta, each having energy prescribed by
Planck’s radiation formula:
E = hν .
(6.1)
The total energy of the electromagnetic wave in this model would then be the sum
of the energies of the single quanta of light “associated” to the wave.
All this was, and still is, in contrast with classical electromagnetism, according to
which an electromagnetic wave is a continuous system whose energy is proportional
to the wave’s amplitude rather than its frequency. What happened in the photoelectric
effect, Einstein said, was that by irradiating the metal with a monochromatic wave
each energy packet associated to the wave was absorbed by an electron in the metal,
and transformed into kinetic energy. To justify the experimental evidence Einstein
postulated, more precisely, that the packet could be absorbed either completely or not
at all, without intermediate possibilities. If, and only if, the energy of the quantum
was equal to, or bigger than, the electron’s bonding energy E0 to the metal (which
depends on the metal, and can be measured irrespective of the photoelectric effect),
would the electron be instantaneously emitted, transforming the energetic excess of
the absorbed quantum into kinetic energy. The frequency ν0 := E0/h would thus
detect the threshold observed experimentally. This conjecture turned out to match
the experimental data perfectly.
6.2.2
The Compton Effect
The ﬁrst observation and study of the Compton effect dates back 1923. It concerns
the scattering of monochromatic electromagnetic waves of extremely high frequency
– x-rays (> 1017 Hz) and γ rays (> 1018 Hz) – caused by matter (gases, ﬂuids and
solids). It is useful to remind that monochromatic electromagnetic waves have both
a ﬁxed frequency ν and a ﬁxed wavelength λ, whose product is constant and equal
to the speed of light, νλ = c, irrespective of the kind of wave. Hence in the sequel
we will talk about the wavelength of monochromatic waves. Simplifying as much
as possible, the Compton effect consists in the following phenomenon. Suppose we
irradiate a substance (the obstacle) with a plane monochromatic electromagnetic
wave that moves along the direction z with given wavelength λ. Then we observe a
wave scattered by the obstacle and decomposed into several components (i.e. several
wavelengths or frequencies). One component is scattered in every direction and has
the same wavelength of the incoming wave. Every other component has a wavelength
λ(θ), depending on the angle θ of observation, that is slightly bigger than λ. If we
deﬁne θ to be the angle between the wave’s incoming direction z and the outgoing
direction (after hitting the obstacle, wavelength λ(θ)), we have the equation

6.2 Particle Aspects of Electromagnetic Waves
293
λ(θ) = λ + f (1 −cos θ) ,
(6.2)
where the constant f has the dimension of a length and comes from the experimental
data. Its value2 is f = 0.024(±0.001) Å. The region around the z-axis is isotropic.
Classical electromagnetic theory was, and still is, inadequate to explain this phe-
nomenon. However, as Compton proved, the effect could be clariﬁed by making
three assumptions, all incompatible with the classical theory but in agreement with
Planck and Einstein’s speculations about light quanta.
(a) The electromagnetic wave is made of particles that carry energy according to
Planck’s equation (6.1), exactly as Einstein predicted.
(b) Each quantum of light possesses a momentum
p := ℏk ,
(6.3)
where k is the wavevector of the wave associated to the quantum (see below). Here
and henceforth, following the standard notation of physicists:
ℏ:= h
2π .
(c) Quanta interact, through collisions (in relativistic regime, in general), with the
outer-most atoms and electrons of the obstacle, obeying the conservation laws of
momentum and energy.
Remark 6.3 Concerning assumption (c), let us stress that the wavevector k asso-
ciated to a plane monochromatic wave has, by deﬁnition, the same direction and
orientation of the travelling wave, and its modulus is 2π/λ, where λ is the wave-
length. Equivalently, if ν denotes the frequency,
|k| = 2π/λ = 2πν/c ,
(6.4)
where we have used the well-known relationship
νλ = c
(6.5)
for monochromatic electromagnetic waves and c = 2.99792 · 108 m/s is the speed
of light in vacuum.
■
The interested reader will ﬁnd below a few more details. Under the assumptions
made above, the energy and momentum conservation laws to be used in a relativistic
regime, i.e. when (certain) speeds approach c, read as follow:

On the left we have the quantities before the collision, on the right those after the
interaction. The constant me = 9.1096 · 10−31 Kg is the mass of the electron. The
electron is thought of as at rest prior to the collision with the quantum of light. After
the collision the quantum is scattered at an angle θ, while the electron travels at
velocity v. The wavevector before the collision, k, is parallel to z (this direction is
arbitrary, but ﬁxed), while the wavevector of the quantum after the collision, k(θ),
forms an angle θ with z.

Because of (6.1) and ν = c/λ, we easily ﬁnd Eq.(6.2) written in the form
λ(θ) = λ +

(6.9)
so that f = h/(mec). The actual numerical value coincides with the experimental
one when one substitutes the values for h, me, c. By taking the formal limit as
me →+∞, Eq.(6.9) gives λ(θ) →λ. This explains the isotropic component of the
scattered wave with identical wavelength (to the incoming one), as if this component
were due to quanta of light interacting with particles of much bigger mass than the
electron’s (an atom of the substance, or the entire obstacle).
Remark 6.4 The models of Einstein and Compton explain the photoelectric effect
and formula (6.2) perfectly, both in quantitative and qualitative terms. Yet they must
be considered ad hoc models, unrelated and actually conﬂicting with the physics
knowledge of their times. The idea that electromagnetic waves, hence also light,
have a particle structure cannot account for the wavelike phenomena – such as inter-
ference and diffraction – known since Newton and Huygens. Somehow, the wave
and corpuscular nature of light (or an electromagnetic wave) must co-exist in the
real world. This is forbidden in the paradigm of classical physics, but possible in
the totally-relativistic formulation of QM by the introduction of photons, massless
particles which we shall not examine thoroughly.

6.3
An Overview of Wave Mechanics
In this text we will not discuss the quantum properties of light, which would require
a deeper study of the formalism of Quantum Mechanics. In a reversal of viewpoint,
the ideas about the early attempts to describe light from a quantum perspective,
introduced previously, proved very practical to formulate Wave Mechanics, which
has rights to be considered the ﬁrst step towards a formulation of QM.
Wave Mechanics is among the ﬁrst rudimentary versions3 of QM for particles with
mass. We will spend only a little time on spelling out the foundational ideas of Wave
Mechanics that shed light on the cornerstones of the QM formalism. In particular,
we will forego result that are historically related to Schrödinger’s stationary equation
and the ensuing description of the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom. We will
return to these issues after the formalism has been set up.
6.3.1
De Broglie Waves
A quantum of light, according to Einstein and Compton, is associated to a monochro-
matic plane electromagnetic wave with wavenumber k = p/ℏand angular frequency
ω = E/ℏ, which is just the 2π-multiple of the frequency ν. Each component of the
plane wave (one along each of the three orthonormal directions of the electric or
magnetic ﬁeld vibrating perpendicularly to k) has the form of a scalar wave:
ψ(t, x) = Aei(k·x−tω) .
(6.10)
Actually only the real part of the above has any physical meaning, but it is much
more convenient to use complex-valued waves, for a number of reasons. For instance,
complex waves appear in Fourier’s decomposition (see Sect.3.7) of a general solution
to the electromagnetic ﬁeld equations (Maxwell’s equations) or, more generally,
d’Alembert’s equation. In terms of momentum and energy of the quantum of light,
the same wave may be written as
ψ(t, x) = Ae
i
ℏ(p·x−t E) .
(6.11)
Note how only the momentum and the energy of the quantum of light appear in the
expression. In 1924 de Broglie put forward a truly revolutionary conjecture: just like
particles (photons) are associated to electromagnetic waves in certain experimental
contexts, so one should be able to relate some sort of wave to a particle of matter.
According to de Broglie, this ‘wave of matter’ should be of the form (6.11), where
now p and E are understood as the momentum and (kinetic) energy of a particle.
The wavelength associated to a particle of momentum p,
3Another version, developed in parallel by Heisenberg, consists in so-called Matrix Mechanics,
which we will not treat.

296

Phenomenology of Quantum Systems and Wave Mechanics: An Overview
λ = h/|p| ,
(6.12)
is called de Broglie wavelength of the particle.
It was not at all clear what the nature of these alleged waves could be until 1927,
when experimental evidence was gained of waves associated to electronic behaviour,
throughtwoexperimentscarriedoutbyDavissonandGermer,andindependentlyG.P.
Thompson. Without going into details, let us just say the following. It is a known fact
that when a (sound, electromagnetic,…) wave hits an obstacle with an inner structure
of dimensions comparable to, or larger than the wavelength, the scattered wave
undergoes so-called diffraction. The various internal parts of the obstacle interact
with the wave creating constructive and destructive interference. The resulting wave
creates a pattern made of areas of alternating intensity on a screen placed behind
the obstacle (darker and brighter areas in the case of light beams). These ﬁgures are
called diffraction patterns. If the obstacle is a crystal, the analysis of the diffraction
pattern allows to determine the inner structure of the crystal itself. Davisson, Germer
and G.P. Thompson shot beams of electrons through a crystalline structure of mesh
1 Å, thus generating patterns made of clusters of pinhead dots: the traces left by the
electrons that had hit the screen. The incredible fact, endorsing de Broglie’s thesis,
was that the diffraction patterns would appear only if de Broglie’s wavelength was
comparable to or smaller than the mesh, exactly as in electromagnetic diffraction.
Remark 6.5 It is important to underline that the diffraction phenomenon strictly
depends on the wavelike nature of waves (it is due to something that oscillates and
to the superposition principle). Diffraction patterns cannot be generated by particles
that obey the usual laws of classical mechanics, whatever the obstacle.
■
6.3.2
Schrödinger’s Wavefunction and Born’s Probabilistic
Interpretation
In 1926 Schrödinger took de Broglie’s ideas seriously and in two famous and extra-
ordinary papers made a more detailed hypothesis: he associated to a particle not a
single plane wave like (6.11), but rather a wave packet made by the superposition of
de Broglie waves (in the sense of the Fourier transform). For free particles, whose
energy is purely kinetic, Schrödinger’s wave reads:
ψ(t, x) =

R3
e
i
ℏ(p·x−t E(p))
(2πℏ2)3/2
ˆψ(p) d3p ,
(6.13)
where E(p) := p2/(2m), and m is the particle’s mass. Schrödinger observed that
ray optics relies on a relation, called eikonal equation [GPS01, CCP82], that bears
a strong formal resemblance to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation [FaMa06, GPS01,
CCP82] of classical mechanics. He was looking for a fundamental equation for matter
in a wave mechanics of sorts, hoping it would stand to Hamilton-Jacobi’s equation

6.3 An Overview of Wave Mechanics
297
in a similar way d’Alembert’s equation approximates the eikonal equation [GPS01,
CCP82]. In a nutshell, wave mechanics should stand to classical mechanics as wave
optics stands to ray optics. The celebrated Schrödinger equation was born. Only after
we have constructed the formalism will we recover Schrödinger’s equation. For a
particle subject to a force with potential U, say f(t, x) = −∇U(t, x), the equation
reads:
iℏ∂ψ(t, x)
∂t
=

−ℏ2
2m Δ + U(t, x)

ψ(t, x)
(6.14)
where Δ = 3
j=1
∂2
∂x2
j is the Laplacian on R3.
The de Broglie-Schrödinger wave ψ is a complex-valued function, and was called
the wavefunction of the particle to which it is attached. The physical interpreta-
tion of the wavefunction ψ – at least in the standard interpretation (“Copenhagen’s
interpretation”) of the QM formalism – came from Born in 1926:
ρ(t, x) :=
|ψ(t, x)|2

R3 |ψ(t, y)|2d3y
is the probability density of detecting the particle at the point x and at time t measured
during an experiment meant to determine the particle’s position.
Born’s interpretation turned out to agree with later experience, but essentially
was already in line with the experimental evidence found by Davisson, Germer and
G.P. Thompson, by which the traces left by particles on the screen clustered in
regions where ρ(t, x) > 0 and were absent where ρ(t, x) = 0, thus giving rise to the
diffraction pattern.
Remark 6.6
(1) From a mathematical point of view Born’s hypothesis only requires square-
integrable wavefunctions that are not almost everywhere zero. Put equivalently, non-
zero elements in L2(R3, d3x) make physical sense, and a Hilbert space makes its
appearance for the very ﬁrst time in the construction of QM. (It is physically irrelevant
that de Broglie’s plane waves have no straightforward meaning in the light of Born’s
interpretation, for they do not belong in L2(R3, d3x). Plane monochromatic waves,
used to understand experimental results à la de Broglie, can be approximated arbi-
trarily well by elements of L2(R3, d3x) by using distributions ˆψ(p) close to a value
p0, which in turn determines with the desired accuracy the wavelength λ0 = |p0|/h
of de Broglie.)
(2) Assuming Born’s interpretation, and in absence of experiments to determine
its position, the particle with wavefunction ψ cannot evolve in time by the laws of
classical mechanics. For if it followed a regular trajectory, as classically prescribed,
the function |ψ|2 would have to vanish almost everywhere away from the trajectory.
But any regular curve in R3 has zero measure, so |ψ|2 would be null almost every-

298

Phenomenology of Quantum Systems and Wave Mechanics: An Overview
where in R3, a contradiction. In other terms when no experiment is made to detect
a particle’s position, the particle cannot be thought of as a classical object, for its
time evolution is governed by the evolution of the wave ψ (solution to Schrödinger’s
equation).
(3) If we accept, as in the Copenhagen interpretation, that the wavefunction ψ
describes in full the physical state of the particle, then the particle’s position must be
physically indeﬁnite before an experiment is conducted to pin it down. Furthermore,
it must be attached indissolubly to the experiment in a probabilistic way. It is wrong
to think that the probabilistic description is meant to cover for our ignorance about
the system’s state (“the position is well determined, but we do not know it”). In the
Copenhagen interpretation the position does not exist until we make an experiment to
determine it and until the particle’s state (the maximum amount of information about
its physical properties in time) is described by ψ. In wave mechanics a quantum
has, thus, a dual wave-particle essence, but the two never clash because they never
manifest themselves simultaneously.

6.4
Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle
When one tries to evaluate experimentally an arbitrary quantity in a physical system,
the state of the system may be altered by interacting with it. In principle, the clas-
sical description would allow to make this perturbation negligible. In 1927 Heisen-
berg realised that the combined hypotheses of Planck, Einstein, Compton and de
Broglie had a momentous (and epistemologically relevant) consequence. In quanti-
tative terms Heisenberg’s principle asserts that if we consider quantum systems and
particular quantities to be measured, it is not always possible to disregard (as inﬁn-
itesimal) the variation in the state of the system generated by a measurement: that
is because Planck’s constant bounds from below the product of certain quantities.
Having made thought experiments involving some of the hypotheses in the Planck,
Einstein, Compton and de Broglie models, Heisenberg concluded that:
in trying to determine the position or the momentum of a particle moving along
a given axis x, we alter the momentum or the position, respectively, along the same
axis, in such a way that the product of the two smallest variations Δx, Δp (of the
ﬁnal values of position and momentum) obeys
ΔxΔp ≳h .
(6.15)
Instead, if position and momentum are measured along orthogonal axes the above
product can be made arbitrarily small.

6.4 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle
299
Equation(6.15) is Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle for position and momentum.
An analogous relationship holds for the uncertainty ΔE of a particle’s energy E and
the uncertainty Δt of the instant t of measurement of the energy4:
ΔEΔt ≳h .
(6.16)
To illustrate the matter let us consider the thought experiment whereby one seeks to determine
the position X of an electron, with known initial momentum P, by hitting it with a monochromatic
beam of light of wavelength λ that propagates in the direction x. Let us imagine we can read the
position off a screen parallel to the axis x using a lens placed between the axis and the screen. A
quantum of light that has interacted with the electron will go through the lens and hit the screen,
thus producing an image X′. Since the lens’ aperture is ﬁnite, the outgoing direction of the quantum
of light generating X′ cannot be pinned down with absolute precision. Wave optics predicts at X′
a diffraction pattern by which we may measure the coordinate X with a bounded precision
ΔX ≳
λ
sin α ,
where α is half the angle under which we see the lens from X. To the quantum of light there
corresponds a momentum h/λ, so the uncertainty in the component Px of the outgoing quantum
will approximately be h(sin α)/λ. The total momentum of the system ‘particle + quantum of light
+ microscope’ will remain constant, hence the uncertainty in the x-component of the particle’s exit
momentum must equal the corresponding uncertainty in the quantum itself:
ΔPx ≳h

Remark 6.7 Heisenberg’s principle, at this level, bears the same logical (in)consi-
stency of the proto-quantum models of Planck, Einstein, Compton et al. It should be
viewed more like a working assumption towards a novel notion of particle, for which
the classical terms position and momentum make sense only within the boundaries
ﬁxed by the principle itself: a quantum particle is allowed only in physical states in
which momentum and position are neither deﬁned, nor deﬁnable, simultaneously.
It is worth stressing, as we will see, that Heisenberg’s principle is a theorem in
the ﬁnal formulation of QM.

thornier issue than the former’s. We will not enter this territory, and refer to classical textbooks as

Phenomenology of Quantum Systems and Wave Mechanics: An Overview
6.5
Compatible and Incompatible Quantities
Quantum phenomenology, irrespective of the uncertainty principle, shows that there
are pairs of quantities A and B that are incompatible. This means that, in princi-
ple, arbitrarily accurate and simultaneous measurements of A, B cannot be carried
out. More explicitly, suppose we ﬁrst measure quantity A, obtaining a as result, and
immediately after we measure B obtaining b. Any further reading of A, inﬁnitesi-
mally close to B (so not to blame the time lapse), will give a value a1 that is typically
different from a, even by far. The same happens if we swap the roles of A and B.
For instance, position and momentum along a ﬁxed direction are incompati-
ble pairs, and comply with Heisenberg’s principle. The allegiance to Heisenberg
and incompatibility have to do with each other, but the precise relationship can be
explained properly only after the formalism has been set up completely. In general,
incompatible quantities do not satisfy the uncertainty principle.
It turns out that incompatible quantum quantities never depend on one another,
nor do there exist devices capable of measuring them simultaneously.
There is a point to call the attention to: quantum phenomenology shows that
compatible quantities A′ and B′ do exist. This entails that if we measure ﬁrst A′
on the system and read a′, and immediately afterwards measure B′ reading b′, the
next measurement of A′ – as close to B′ as we want (so that time evolution does not
interfere with measurements) – gives the same result a′. The same happens swapping
A′ and B′. In particular, any physical quantity A is compatible with itself and with
any function depending on A (like the position of a particle along a line and its
position squared.)
An example of an incompatible pair on which Heisenberg’s principle does not
pronounce itself is that of two distinct components of a particle’s spin. The spin of the
electron (and of all nuclear and subnuclear particles) was introduced by Goudsmit
and Uhlenbeck in 1925 [Mes99, CCP82] in order to make sense of some “bizarre”
properties, the so-called anomalous Zeeman effect, of atomic energy spectra (spectral
lines) in alkali metals. In a semi-classical sense the spin represents the intrinsic
angular momentum of the electron, which may be considered, from a certain point
of view, a consequence of the nonstop rotation of the electron around its centre of
mass. This explanation, however, is misleading and cannot be taken verbatim. The
deeper meaning of the spin emerges in Wigner’s framework, whereby an elementary
quantum particle is deﬁned as an elementary system that is invariant under the action
of the Poincaré group.
Associated to the spin is an intrinsic magnetic momentum responsible for the
anomalous Zeeman effect. At any rate, the spin is a vector-valued quantity with char-
acteristic quantum features, which distinguish it from a classical angular momentum
andhencemakeitaquantumangularmomentum.Theﬁrstdifferenceisintherangeof
the spin’s modulus. In the unit ℏthese values are always of the type √s(s + 1), where
s is an integer ﬁxed by the kind of particle; for instance, s = 1/2 for the electron.
Each of the three components of the spin, in a positive orthonormal frame system,
can take any of the 2s + 1 discrete values −s, −s + 1, . . . , s −1, s. The spin’s three

components are pairwise incompatible quantities, for measuring in rapid sequence
two of them gives distinct readings, as explained above. It is important to say that
the components of a particle’s orbital momentum and total angular momentum are
incompatible exactly in the same way.
Compatible quantities for a quantum particle are, for instance, the x-component
of the momentum and the y-component of the position vector.

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions,
Quantum States and Observables
Some historians claim that it is very difﬁcult, nowadays, to ﬁnd
the line separating – and at the same time joining – the
experimental level from the so-called theoretical one. But their
view already includes several arbitrary elements, the so-called
approximations.
Paul K. Feyerabend
In this chapter we will describe the overall mathematical structure of Quantum
Mechanics. The strategy essentially goes back to von Neumann, but we shall present
a more contemporary account based on Gleason’s theorem. It will entail extending
classical (Hamiltonian) mechanics and keeping track of the experimental evidence
about the nature of quantum systems seen in the previous chapter.
The ﬁrst section summarises the results of Chap.6, emphasising aspects that will
be fundamental later.
In section two we will re-examine a few facets of Hamilton’s formulation of
mechanics from a set-theoretical and formal/logical perspective. We shall present
the interpretation of the theory’s foundations, whereby elementary propositions on
the physical system are described by a σ-algebra, while states can be described by
Borel probability measures (possibly, Dirac measures) on the σ-algebra.
Section three will show how the classical structure may be modiﬁed to comprise
quantum phenomenology. Now the σ-algebra is replaced by the lattice of projectors
on a suitable Hilbert space, and a generalised σ-additive measure on the projectors’
lattice takes the place of states. Similar approaches have been explored in depth by
[Mac63, Jau73, Pir76, Var07].
We shall enter the heart of the matter in sections four. With the aid of Gleason’s
theorem we shall explain that the aforementioned generalised measures are nothing
but positive trace-class operators with trace one. This will allow us to introduce the
convex space of quantum states, in which pure states (or rays) are identiﬁed with
extreme points.

Section ﬁve is devoted to the heuristic deﬁnition of observables as collections
of elementary propositions giving projector-valued measures (PVM) on the Hilbert
space of the system. The construction will also motivate the spectral theorem, proved
later in the book. We will also describe formally the notion of compatible proposi-
tions.
A number of advanced issues, both foundational and technical, will be addressed
in the penultimate section. One example for all is the famous Solèr theorem, that
tells how to recover the Hilbert space form the lattice of elementary propositions
of a quantum system. This part also includes a survey of the features of von Neu-
mann algebras relevant in quantum theories. A general critical discussion appears in
[BeCa81], while more recent results can be found in [EGL09].
The last section introduces superselection rule at the level of the lattice of ele-
mentary propositions.
7.1
The Pillars of the Standard Interpretation of Quantum
Phenomenology
Let us begin by summarising a few cardinal features of the behaviour of quantum
systems, which were brieﬂy described in Chap.6.
QM1. (i) On a quantum system whose state has been ﬁxed, measurements have a
probabilistic outcome. Hence it not possible to foresee the measurement’s outcome,
but only its probability.
(ii) However, if a quantity has been measured and gives a certain reading, repeat-
ing the measurement immediately after (so that the system does not evolve in the
meantime) will give the same result.
QM2. (i) There exist incompatible physical quantities, in the following sense. Call
A, B two such quantities. If we ﬁrst measure A on the system (in a given state) and
read a as outcome, and immediately after we measure B obtaining b, a subsequent
measuring of A – as close as we want to the measurement of B to avoid ascribing
the result to the evolution of the state – produces a reading a1 ̸= a, in general. The
same happens swapping A and B.
Consequently: (a) incompatible quantum quantities never depend on one another,
and (b) there are no instruments capable of simultaneous measurements.
(ii) There exist compatible physical quantities in the following sense. Call A′,
B′ two such quantities. If we ﬁrst measure A′ on the system (in a given state) and
obtain a as result, and immediately after we measure B obtaining b, a subsequent
measuring of A – as close as we want to the measurement of B to avoid attributing the
result to the evolution of the state – produces the same reading a. The same happens
swapping A and B.
Consequently: (a) every physical quantity is compatible with itself, and (b) if two
quantities are functionally dependent (e.g. the energy and its square), then they are
compatible.

7.1 The Pillars of the Standard Interpretation of Quantum Phenomenology
305
Remark 7.1 (1) QM1 and QM2 refer to physical quantities that do not characterise
a physical system. By this we intend quantities whose range does not depend on the
state and therefore allow to distinguish a system from another. On the contrary, the
remaining quantities mentioned by QM1 and QM2 take values that depend on the
state of the system.
The physical quantities that QM1 and QM2 refer to, in relation to whether the
outcome of successive experiments can or not be reproduced, are of course quantities
that attain discrete values. As far as continuous quantities are concerned the matter is
much more delicate, and we will not examine it [BGL95]. Irrespective of the type of
quantities (continuous vs. discrete) what we can say, in general, is: two quantities are
compatible if and only if there exists a device capable of simultaneous measurements.
Furthermore, QM1 and QM2 refer to extremely idealised measuring processes,
in particular those during which the microscopic physical system is not destroyed
by the measurement itself. The measuring procedures employed in the experimental
practice are rather diversiﬁed.
(2) It is clear we cannot be absolutely certain that quantum systems satisfy (i) in QM1.
We could be tempted to think that the stochastic outcome of measurements is really
due to the lack of full knowledge scientists have of the system’s state, and that by
knowing it in toto they would be able to predict the outcome of measurements. In this
sense quantum probability would merely have an epistemic nature. In the standard
interpretation of QM, the so-called Copenhagen interpretation, the stochastic out-
come of a measurement is assumed as a primitive feature of quantum systems. There
are nonetheless interesting attempts to interpret quantum phenomenology based on
alternative formalisms (the so-called formulations by hidden variables) [Bon97].
There, the stochastic feature is explained as it were due to partial human knowledge
about the system’s true state, which is described by more variables (and in differ-
ent fashion) than those needed in the standard formulation. None of these attempts
is considered nowadays completely satisfactory, and does not threaten the standard
interpretation and formulation of QM when one also considers relativistic quantum
theories, and relativistic QFT in particular (despite some are indeed deep, like Bohm’s
theory).
But we must stress that one cannot build a completely classical physical theory
(that counts non-quantum relativistic theories among classical ones) that is capable
of explaining the experimental phenomenology of a quantum system in its entirety.
Hidden variables, in order to agree with known evidence, must at any rate satisfy a
rather unusual contextuality property for classical theories. Furthermore, any theory
that wishes to explain the quantum phenomenology, QM included, must be nonlocal
[Bon97]. As we shall see in Sect.13.4.3, actually, subsequent to the work of Einstein,
Podolsky and Rosen ﬁrst, and then Bell, experiments have proved the existence of
correlations among measurements made in different regions of space and at lapses
so short that transmission of information between events is out of the question, by
whichever physical mean moving slower than the speed of light in vacuum.

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
(3) It is implicit in QM1 and QM2 that the physical systems of interest, both in quan-
tum theory and quantum phenomenology, are divided in two large categories: mea-
suring instruments and quantum systems. The Copenhagen formulation assumes that
measuring devices are systems obeying the laws of classical physics. These hypothe-
ses match the data coming from experiments, and although quite crude, theoretically-
speaking, they lie at the heart of the interpretation’s formalism. Therefore not much
can be said about them within the standard formulation. At the moment, for instance,
it is not clear where to draw the line between classical and quantum systems, nor
how this boundary may be described inside the formalism, and not even whether the
compound system ‘instrument + quantum system’ can be itself considered a larger
quantum system, and as such treated by the formalism. In closing, the interaction
between an instrument and a quantum system, which produces the actual measure-
ment, is not described from within the standard quantum formalism as a dynamical
process. For a deeper discussion on these stimulating and involved issues we refer
to [Bon97, Des99], and also to the superb section dedicated to foundational aspects
of quantum theories in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.1

Classical Systems: Elementary Propositions and States
Letusseehow(Borel)probabilitymeasurescanbeemployedtorepresentthephysical
states of classical systems. A generalisation will be used later to describe the states
of a quantum system mathematically.
7.2.1
States as Probability Measures
The modern formal treatment of probability theory, due to Kolmogorov, translates
into the study of probability measures. We recap below a few deﬁnitions taken from
Sect.1.4.
Deﬁnition A positive, σ-additive measure μ on the measure space (X, Σ) is called
a probability measure if μ(X) = 1.
The simplest case of a probability measure on (X, Σ) is certainly the Dirac measure
δx concentrated at x ∈X:
δx(E) = 0 if x /∈E,
δx(E) = 1 if x ∈E,
for any E ∈Σ.
We shall work with Borel measures, so we recall the following notions from Sect.1.4,
which we have already used and will be useful in the rest of the book.

7.2 Classical Systems: Elementary Propositions and States
307
Deﬁnition Let X be a topological space.
(a) The Borel σ-algebra of X, B(X), is the smallest (under intersections) σ-
algebra containing the open sets of X.
(b) The elements of B(X) are called Borel sets of X.
(c) A map f : X →C is (Borel) measurable if it is measurable with respect to
B(X) and B(C), i.e. f −1(E) ∈B(X) for any E ∈B(C).
Obviously, in (c), B(C) refers to the standard topology of C, and the deﬁnition can
be stated to comprise R-valued maps and B(R).
Deﬁnition If X is a locally compact Hausdorff space, a Borel measure on X is a
positive, σ-additive measure on B(X).
Consider a classical physical system with n spatial freedom degrees, so 2n degrees
overall, including kinetic degrees (“velocities”). The Hamiltonian formulation
[GPS01, FaMa06] of the system’s dynamics, very brieﬂy, goes as follows.
(i) The ambient space is the phase spacetime Hn+1. This is a smooth manifold of
real dimension 2n + 1 formed by the disjoint union2 of 2n-dimensional submanifolds
Ft, all diffeomorphic and smoothly depending on t ∈R:
Hn+1 =

t∈R
Ft .
(ii) The coordinate t ∈R is time, every Ft is the phase space at time t and any
point in Ft represents a state of the system at time t.
(iii) Hn+1 admits an atlas with local coordinates: t, q1, . . . , qn, p1, . . . , pn (where
q1, . . . , qn, p1, . . . , pn are symplectic coordinates on Ft) in which the system’s
evolution is governed by Hamilton’s equations:
dqk
dt
= ∂H(t, q(t), p(t))
∂pk
k = 1, 2, . . . , n ,
(7.1)
dpk
dt = −∂H(t, q(t), p(t))
∂qk
k = 1, 2, . . . , n ,
(7.2)
where H, the Hamiltonian (function) of the system in local coordinates, is known
once the system is known.
With this representation the system’s evolution in time is described by the integral
curves of Hamilton’s differential equations. If s(t) ∈Ft is the state of the system at
time t, each integral curve determines, at any given time t ∈R, a point (t, s(t)) ∈
Hn+1 where the curve meets Ft.
We remark that (in absence of constraints) the choice of a frame system I allows
to decompose locally Hn+1 as a the Cartesian product R × F, where R is the
2Hn+1 is the total space of a ﬁbre bundle with base R (the time axis) and ﬁbres Ft given by 2n-
dimensional symplectic manifolds. There is an atlas on Hn+1 whose local charts have coordinates
t, q1, . . . , qn, p1, . . . , pn, where t is the natural parameter on the base R while the remaining 2n
coordinates deﬁne a local symplectic frame on each Ft.

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
time axis (once the origin has been ﬁxed) and F is identiﬁed with phase space
at time t = 0. Other choices of the framing give different identiﬁcations. Similarly,
the Hamiltonian H, identiﬁed in certain circumstances with the total mechanical
energy of the system, depends on the frame system. However, Hamilton’s equations
of motion are independent of any frame: their solutions do not depend on choices,
but are the same on Hn+1 irrespective of the coordinates.
In certain, fundamental, contexts, like Statistical Mechanics or Thermodynamical
Statistics, the system’s state is not known with absolute precision, so neither is
the evolution of the system. In these cases one uses statistical ensembles [Hua87,
FaMa06]: rather than considering a single system, one takes a statistical ensemble
of identical and independent copies of the system, whose states are distributed in
the various Ft with a certain probability density given locally by a C1 map ρ =
ρ(t, q, p). The density evolves in time in accordance to Liouville’s equation:

i=1

∂qi
∂H
∂pi
−∂H
∂qi
∂ρ


= 0 .
(7.3)
The function ρ(t, s), with s ∈Ft, represents the probability density that the system
is in the state s at time t. The interpretation of ρ requires, for any t:
ρ(t, s) ≥0 and

Ft
ρ dμt = 1 .
(7.4)
The measure μt on B(Ft) is the Lebesgue measure dq1 · · · dqndp1 · · · dpn on every
local symplectic chart of Ft (and extended to Ft using a partition of unity). The
known Liouville theorem states that with this choice μt on every phase space, the
integral in (7.4) does not depend on t ∈R provided ρ solves (7.3) [Hua87, FaMa06,
CCP82].
In case one works with statistical ensembles, the density ρt is still thought of as
the system’s state at time t, even if this notion of state is more general. We shall abide
by this convention, and distinguish sharp states, given by points r(t) ∈Ft, from
probabilistic states, determined by a Liouville density ρt on Ft. In either case the
state at time t can be viewed as a Borel probability measure {νt}t∈R deﬁned on Ft.
More precisely:
(i) for a probabilistic state3 νt(E) :=

E ρ(t, s)dμt if E ∈B(Ft);
(ii) for a sharp state νt := δr(t).
Remark 7.2 In order to represent the system’s states at time t in a completely gen-
eral way, thereby foregoing the evolution problem and also abandoning the standard
Hamiltonian formulation, one could use topological manifolds Ft rather than smooth
ones. States (at time t) could be represented in terms of probability measures for the
Borel σ-algebra. The existence of a topology on Ft is intrinsically tied to the exis-
3Ft is a smooth manifold hence a locally compact Hausdorff space (since locally homeomorphic
to Rn). As μt is deﬁned on B(Ft) and ρt is continuous, νt is well deﬁned on B(Ft).

7.2 Classical Systems: Elementary Propositions and States

tence of “neighbourhoods” for its points, arising from experimental errors that may
be inﬁnitesimal but not negligible. More precisely, the possibility of distinguishing
points in Ft, despite the measuring errors, is expressed mathematically by requesting
a Hausdorff topology on Ft (as happens on a smooth manifold).
■
7.2.2
Propositions as Sets, States as Measures on Them
If we assume that the Hamiltonian description of our system retains all physical
properties, then it must be possible to describe, in phase space Ft at time t, all
statements about the system that at time t are true, false, or true with a certain
probability, in some way or another. Moreover, it should be possible to recover the
truth value of those propositions, i.e. the probability they are true, from the state νt
of the system. Here is a natural way to do this.
Observe ﬁrst that every proposition P determines a subset in Ft that contains the
points (thought of as sharp states) that render P true (at time t). We indicate this set
by the same symbol P ⊂Ft. Next, suppose we work with a sharp state, so that νt
is a Dirac measure. Then proposition P is true at time t if and only if the point r(t)
describing the system at time t belongs to the set P. Now assign the conventional
value 0 to a false proposition at time t, and 1 to a true one at t, in relation to state
νt = δr(t). The crucial observation is that the truth value of P is νt(P), when the state
is νt, thought of as the measure of P ⊂Ft with respect to the (Dirac) measure νt.
This fact clariﬁes the concrete meaning of the Dirac measure νt viewed as system’s
state at time t. Furthermore, the same interpretation can be employed when the state
is probabilistic: νt(P) represents the probability that proposition P ⊂Ft is true at
time t when the state νt is probabilistic.
Remark 7.3 (1) Everything we said makes sense if the set P belongs to the σ-algebra
on which the measures νt are deﬁned. This is the Borel σ-algebra, and hence it is
reasonably large.
(2) One proposition may be formulated in different yet equivalent ways. When we
identify propositions with sets in Ft we are explicitly assuming that if two proposi-
tions determine the same subset in Ft, they must be considered identical.
■
7.2.3
Set-Theoretical Interpretation of the Logical
Connectives
Given two propositions P, Q, we can compose them using logical connectives to
obtainotherpropositions.Inparticular,wecanformthepropositions PO Q and PE Q
using the binary connectives called disjunction (‘inclusive or’), and conjunction
(‘and’). Negifying one proposition produces its negation ⊣P.
We can interpret these propositions in terms of sets in the Borel σ-algebra on Ft:

310
7
The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
(i) P O Q corresponds to P ∪Q;
(ii) P E Q corresponds to P ∩Q;
(iii) ⊣P corresponds to Ft \ P.
There is a partial order relation on subsets of Ft given by the inclusion: P ≤Q if
and only if P ⊂Q.
At the level of propositions, the most natural interpretation of P ⊂Q is to say
that P implies Q, i.e. P ⇒Q. Equivalently: each time the system is in a sharp state
satisfying P, the state satisﬁes Q as well. For non-sharp states, the probability that
Q is true is not smaller than the probability that P is true.
Remark 7.4 (1) The truth probability of composite propositions can be computed
from the starting propositions using the measure νt, because a σ-algebra is closed
under the set-theoretical operations corresponding to O, E , ⊣.
(2) It is easy to see that if νt is a Dirac measure, the truth probability (in this case either
0 or 1) assigned to each expression (i), (ii), (iii), coincides with the value found on the
truth tables of the connective used. For instance, PO Q is true (νt(P ∪Q) = 1) if and
only if at least one of its constituent propositions is true (νt(P) = 1 or νt(Q) = 1);
in fact the point x at which the Dirac measure δx = νt concentrates lies in P ∪Q iff
x lies in P or in Q.
■
7.2.4
“Inﬁnite” Propositions and Physical Quantities
Propositional calculus normally disregards propositions made by inﬁnitely many
propositions and connectives like P1O P2 O . . . Interpreting propositions and con-
nectives in terms of points and operations on a σ-algebra, though, allows to “handle”
inﬁnitely-long propositions.
We can relate (at least) some of these propositions to measurable physical quan-
tities on the system. Generally speaking, we may consider the physical quantities
deﬁned on our Hamiltonian system as a collection of functions, regular to some
degree, deﬁned on phase spacetime and real-valued: f : Hn+1 →R. A fairly broad
choice for regularity is to take the class of maps that restrict to Borel measurable
maps on each ﬁbre Ft. Less radical options are continuous maps, C1 maps, or
even C∞maps. From the point of view of physics it may seem natural to require
physical quantities be described by functions that are at least continuous, because
measurements are always affected by experimental errors when ﬁnding the point in
Ft representing the state at time t: if the maps were not continuous, small errors
would cause enormous variations in a quantity’s values. Nevertheless we must also
remember there might be quantities with discrete range, for which the above issue is
meaningless (discrete values can be distinguished using instruments with sufﬁcient
– ﬁnite – precision). As we are interested in the passage to the quantum case rather
than in analysing the classical case, we shall not go deep into this kind of problem.
We shall limit ourselves to working at instants t for which the quantities of con-
cern will be measurable functions f : Ft →R. If f : Ft →R is a quantity that can

7.2 Classical Systems: Elementary Propositions and States
311
be measured on the system (at time t), using it we can construct statements of this kin:
P( f )
E
=
“The value that f assumes on the system’s state belongs to the Borel subset E ⊂R”,
Considering Borel sets E, and not just open intervals or singlets for example, allows
to treat quantities with both continuous and discrete ranges in the same way, and also
keep track of the fact that the measurement made by an instrument is a set, not just
a point, owing to the ﬁnite precision of the instrument. As a matter of fact B(R)
contains closed sets, ﬁnite sets, countable sets and so on. In set-theoretical terms
P( f )
E
is associated to the Borel set
P( f )
E
= f −1(E) ⊂Ft ,
that we continue to denote by the same symbol. (As explained above, by this con-
vention the probability that P( f )
E
is true for the system at time t is νt(P( f )
E ), once the
state νt is known.)
Consider an interval [a, b), b ≤+∞. Decompose it in the disjoint union of
inﬁnitely many subintervals: [a, b) = ∪∞
i=1[ai, ai+1), where a1 := a, ai < ai+1 and
ai →b as i →∞. Then the proposition
P( f )
[a,b) =
“The value of f on the state of the system falls in the Borel set [a, b)”
can be clearly written as an inﬁnite disjunction
P( f )
[a,b) = O+∞
i=1 P( f )
[ai,ai+1)
of statements of the form:
P( f )
[ai,ai+1) =
“The value of f on the state of the system falls in the Borel set [ai, ai+1)”.
This corresponds to writing the set P( f )
[a,b) as the disjoint union:
P( f )
[a,b) = ∪+∞
i=1 P( f )
[ai,ai+1) .
Therefore it makes physical sense to assume the existence of statements built by
inﬁnitely many connectives and propositions.
Since negating O gives E , if we assume the set of admissible propositions is
closed under ⊣, then we must also accept propositions involving inﬁnitely many E s
as physically meaningful.
The possibility of representing propositions as sets in a σ-algebra, and thus com-
pute the probability they are true on a state using the corresponding measure, suggests

312
7
The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
to allow for propositions with countably many connectives O or E , because the cor-
responding sets still belong in the σ-algebra, which is closed under countable unions
and intersections.
To obtain a structure “isomorphic” to the σ-algebra built from atomic formulas
and O, E , ⊣, we need to add two more propositions, playing the role of the sets ∅and
Ft. These are the contradiction (whose truth probability is 0, whichever the state),
denoted 0, and the tautology 1 (of truth probability equal to 1, whichever the state).
Once propositions and sets are identiﬁed, the σ-algebra structure enables us to
declare that the set of elementary propositions P relative to the physical system of
concern, equipped with the logical connectives O, E , ⊣, is “isomorphic” to a σ-
algebra. The truth value of a proposition P, for sharp states, or its truth probability,
for probabilistic states, on a given state at time t equals νt(P), where now P ⊂Ft
is the set corresponding to the proposition.
Remark 7.5 (1) We may ask whether the σ-algebra of all propositions on the system
corresponds to the full Borel σ-algebra of Ft, or if it is smaller. If we assume every
bounded measurable real map on Ft is a physical quantity, then the answer is clearly
yes, because among those maps are the characteristic functions of measurable subsets
of Ft.
(2) As earlier remarked, once we ﬁx a frame system I (in absence of constraints, as
in the cases at hand) the phase spacetime Hn+1 of the system is locally diffeomorphic
to the Cartesian product R × F, where F is the phase space at time 0 and R the
time line (with given origin). Thus we may regard propositions at any given instant
t as Borel subsets of F, and any state at time t as a probability measure on F.
Henceforth, especially when generalising to the quantum case, we will harness this
simpliﬁcation of the formalism that results from a choice of frame.

7.2.5
Basics on Lattice Theory
In physical systems we can identify propositions and sets, and think of states as mea-
sures on sets. In order to pass to quantum systems, where there is no notion of phase
space, it is important to raise the following question. Do there exist mathematical
structures that are not σ-algebras of sets but sort of isomorphic to one? The answer
is yes and comes from the theory of lattices.
In the sequel we will use some basic notions about posets. We shall assume they
are known to the reader; if not they can be found in Sect.A.1.
Deﬁnition 7.6 A partially ordered set (X, ≥) is a lattice when, for any a, b ∈X,
(a) sup{a, b} exists, denoted a ∨b (sometimes called ‘join’ of a, b);
(b) inf{a, b} exists, written a ∧b (sometimes ‘meet’ of a, b).
(The poset is not required to be totally ordered.)
Remark 7.7 (1) If (X, ≥) is partially ordered, as usual a ≤b means b ≥a, for any
a, b ∈X. The following equivalences are easy: a ∧b = a ⇔a ∨b = b ⇔a ≤

b.
(2) On any lattice X, by deﬁnition of inf, sup we have the following properties, for
any a, b, c ∈X:
associativity: (a ∧b) ∧c = a ∧(b ∧c) and (a ∨b) ∨c = a ∨(b ∨c);
commutativity: a ∨b = b ∨a and a ∧b = b ∧a.
absorption: a ∨(a ∧b) = a and a ∧(a ∨b) = a.
idempotency: a ∨a = a and a ∧a = a.
By the associative property we can write a ∨b ∨c ∨d and a ∧b ∧c ∧d without
ambiguity.
(3) The above properties characterise lattices: a set X equipped with binary operations
∧: X × X →X, ∨: X × X →X that satisfy the properties of (2) is partially ordered
by the relation a ≥b ⇔b = b ∧a. In that case sup{a, b} = a ∨b and inf{a, b} =
a ∧b.
■
Various types of lattices exist, and the next deﬁnition describes some of them.
Deﬁnition 7.8 (Lattice) A lattice (X, ≥) is called:
(a) distributive if ∨and ∧distribute over one another: for any a, b, c ∈X,
a ∨(b ∧c) = (a ∨b) ∧(a ∨c) ,
a ∧(b ∨c) = (a ∧b) ∨(a ∧c) ;
(7.5)
(b) bounded if it admits a minimum 0 and a maximum 1 (sometimes called ‘bottom’
and ‘top’);
(c) orthocomplemented if it is bounded and admits a mapping X ∋a →¬a, where
¬a is the orthogonal complement of a, such that:
(i) a ∨¬a = 1 for any a ∈X,
(ii) a ∧¬a = 0 for any a ∈X,
(iii) ¬(¬a) = a for any a ∈X,
(iv) a ≥b implies ¬b ≥¬a for any a, b ∈X;
two elements a, b are
orthogonal, written a ⊥b, if ¬a ≥b (or equivalently ¬b ≥a);
commuting, if a = c1 ∨c3 and b = c2 ∨c3 with ci ⊥c j if i ̸= j;
the centre of the lattice is the set of elements commuting with every element of the
lattice and the lattice is irreducible if its centre is {0, 1};
(d) modular, if q ≥p implies (p ∨r) ∧q = p ∨(r ∧q), ∀p, q,r ∈X;
(e) orthomodular, if orthocomplemented and q ≥p implies q = p ∨((¬p) ∧q),
∀p, q ∈X;
(f) σ-complete, if every countable set {an}n∈N ⊂X admits least upper bound (indi-
cated by ∨n∈Nan) and greatest lower bound (indicated by ∧n∈Nan).
(f)’ complete, if every set A ⊂X admits both least upper bound and greatest lower
bound;
(g) Boolean algebra, if has properties (a), (b) and (c) (hence (d) and (e));
(g)’ Boolean σ-algebra if is a Boolean algebra satisfying (f).

A (distributive, bounded, orthocomplemented, σ-complete, complete) sublat-
tice is a subset in X admitting a lattice structure (distributive, bounded, orthocom-
plemented, σ-complete, complete, respectively) for the restrictions of ≥and ¬.
Remark 7.9 (1) It is immediate to prove that arbitrary intersections of orthocom-
plemented sublattices are orthocomplemented sublattices (with the same minimum,
maximum and orthogonal complement of X).
(2) If X is an orthocomplemented lattice and p, q ∈X belong to a Boolean subalgebra
of X, then p and q commute (remark (6) below). The converse also holds [BeCa81].
Proposition 7.10 Let X be an orthocomplemented lattice. Then p, q ∈X commute
if and only if the orthocomplemented sublattice generated by {p, q} (the intersection
of all bounded orthocomplemented sublattices containing {p, q}) is Boolean.
Proof See Exercise7.7. □
(3) In a general orthocomplemented lattice:
if a ⊥b then a ∧b = 0.
(4) It is easy to see that orthocomplemented lattices X satisfy De Morgan’s laws:
for any a, b ∈X,
¬(a ∨b) = ¬a ∧¬b ,
¬(a ∧b) = ¬a ∨¬b .
(7.6)
These relations can be generalized. The proof of the following statement is immedi-
ate, simply by using the deﬁnition of inf and sup (§A.1).
Proposition 7.11 Let X be an orthocomplemented lattice. Then for any subset A ⊂
X
(a) if A is ﬁnite, then
¬ sup
a∈A
a = inf
a∈A ¬a ,
¬ inf
a∈A a = sup
a∈A
¬a ;
(7.7)
(b) if A is inﬁnite, then supa∈A a exists ⇔infa∈A ¬a exists, and similarly, infa∈A a
exists ⇔supa∈A ¬a exists. In either case, the corresponding relation in (7.7) is valid.
(c) (7.7) holds for every (countable) subset A ⊂X if X is complete (σ-complete).
(5) We have the following implications:
distributivity ⇒modularity ⇒orthomodularity
Therefore the orthomodular condition (the only one satisﬁed by quantum lattices, as
we shall see shortly) is a weaker form of distributivity and modularity.
(6) A Boolean algebra X is distributive, modular, orthomodular and every pair

7.2 Classical Systems: Elementary Propositions and States
315
a, b ∈X commutes: using the distributive law, in particular, a = (a ∧¬b) ∨(a ∧b)
and b = (b ∧¬a) ∨(a ∧b).
■
We leave the following elementary proposition as an exercise for the reader.
Proposition 7.12 The centre of an orthomodular lattice L is a Boolean subalgebra
of L .
Deﬁnition 7.13 If X, Y are lattices, a map h : X →Y is a (lattice) homomorphism
when
h(a ∨X b) = h(a) ∨Y h(b) ,
h(a ∧X b) = h(a) ∧Y h(b) ,
a, b ∈X
(with the obvious notations.) We further require that a homomorphism h satisﬁes:
if X, Y are bounded
h(0X) = 0Y ,
h(1X) = 1Y ;
if X, Y are orthocomplemented
h(¬Xa) = ¬Yh(x) ;
if X, Y are σ-complete
h(∨n∈Nan) = ∨n∈Nh(an) and h(∧n∈Nan) = ∧n∈Nh(an) if {an}n∈N ⊂X ;
and if X, Y are complete
h(sup A) = sup h(A) and h(inf A) = inf h(A) if A ⊂X .
In every case (bounded, orthocomplemented, (σ-)complete lattices, Boolean
(σ-)algebras) if h is bijective it is called isomorphism of the corresponding structure;
in particular, it is called automorphism if X = Y.
Remark 7.14 (1) Since b ≥a ⇔b ∧a = a, the following facts hold. If h : X →Y
is a homomorphism then for any a, b ∈X, a ≥X b implies h(a) ≥Y h(b), with the
obvious notation.
(2) It is immediate to see that the inverse h−1 : Y →X of an isomorphism h : X →Y
(of lattices or Boolean (σ-)algebras) is an isomorphism.
Concerning isomorphisms of lattices:
Proposition 7.15 Let h : X →Y be an orthocomplemented lattice isomorphism. If
both X and Y are (σ-)complete, then h is a (σ-)complete lattice isomorphism.
Proof See Exercise7.4. □
(3) Given an abstract Boolean σ-algebra X, does there exist a concrete σ-algebra
of sets that is isomorphic to X? The answer is contained a general result known as
Loomis–Sikorski theorem [Sik48]. This guarantees that every Boolean σ-algebra

316

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
is isomorphic to a quotient Boolean σ-algebra Σ/N , where Σ is a concrete σ-
algebra of sets over a measurable space and N ⊂Σ is closed under countable
unions; moreover, ∅∈N and for any A ∈Σ with A ⊂N ∈N , then A ∈N . The
equivalence relation is A ∼B ⇔A ∪B \ (A ∩B) ∈N , for any A, B ∈Σ. It is
easy to see the coset space Σ/N inherits the structure of Boolean σ-algebra from
Σ with respect to the (well-deﬁned) partial order [A] ≥[B] if A ⊃B, A, B ∈Σ.
This is the sharpest result in the general case. Consider, for instance, the σ-algebra
B([0, 1]) of Borel sets in [0, 1]. Take the quotient B∗([0, 1]) := B([0, 1])/N ,
where N consists of subsets in [0, 1] of zero (Lebesgue) measure. It can be proved
that B∗([0, 1]) is isomorphic to no σ-algebra of subsets on any measurable space.
But if one restricts to Boolean algebras only, the known Stone representation
theorem [Sto36] asserts that an abstract Boolean algebra is always isomorphic to
some concrete algebra of sets, without the need of a quotient.

7.2.6
The Boolean Lattice of Elementary Propositions for
Classical Systems
We can revert to σ-algebras of sets, and with the deﬁnitions given above the following
assertions are trivial, so their proof is left as exercise.
Proposition 7.17 Every σ-algebra on X is a Boolean σ-algebra where:
(i) the partial order is the inclusion (hence ∨corresponds to ∪and ∧to ∩),
(ii) the maximum and minimum in the Boolean algebra are X and ∅,
(iii) orthocomplements correspond to set-theoretical complements with respect to
X.
Proposition 7.18 Let Σ, Σ′ be σ-algebras on X and X′ respectively, and f : X →
X′ a measurable function.
(a) The sets P( f )
E
:= f −1(E), E ∈Σ′, deﬁne a Boolean σ-subalgebra of the Boolean
σ-algebra of Proposition7.17.
(b) The mapping Σ′ ∋E →P( f )
E
is a homomorphism of Boolean σ-algebras.

7.2 Classical Systems: Elementary Propositions and States
317
The same assertions hold for the set of propositions relative to a physical system.
Proposition 7.19 Propositions relative to a classical physical system form a dis-
tributive, bounded, orthocomplemented and σ-complete lattice, i.e. a Boolean σ-
algebra, where:
(i) the order relation is the logical implication, the conjunction is the intersection
and the disjunction is the union;
(ii) the maximum and minimum are the tautology 1 and the contradiction 0;
(iii) orthocomplementation corresponds to negation.
If a measurable function f : F →R represents a physical quantity, then:
(a) as E varies in the Borel σ-algebra of R, the propositions
P( f )
E
=
“The value that f takes on the state of the system belongs in the Borel set E ⊂R”,
deﬁne a Boolean σ-algebra;
(b) the map that sends a Borel set E ⊂R to the proposition P( f )
E
is a homomorphism
of Boolean σ-algebras.
7.3
Quantum Systems: Elementary Propositions
We can now move on to quantum systems. We shall begin by examining the structure
of elementary propositions, and later we shall discuss the notion of quantum state.
7.3.1
Quantum Lattices and Related Structures in Hilbert
Spaces
In trying to follow an approach that is closest to the classical case, we ﬁrst aim at
ﬁnding a mathematical model for the class of elementary propositions relative to a
quantum system. Then we will evaluate at time t by conducting experiments with
the aid of suitable instruments, whose results will be merely 0 (= the proposition
is false) or 1 (= the proposition is true). At this stage we still do not know how to
describe the system, but we do know that the quantum quantities that are measurable
have to satisfy QM1 and QM2.
For the moment let us concentrate on QM2. As there exist incompatible quantities,
necessarily there must be incompatible propositions. If A and B are incompatible,
then
P(A)
J
=

318
7
The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
“The value of A on the state of the system belongs to the Borel set J ⊂R”,
P(B)
K
=
“The value of B on the state of the system belongs to the Borel set K ⊂R”,
are, in general, incompatible propositions. Their truth values interfere with each
other when we measure them within inﬁnitesimally short lapses (so that the system’s
state is not responsible for the time evolution). We also know no instrument exists
that is capable of evaluating simultaneously two incompatible quantities. Hence it is
physically meaningless, in this context, to say that the above propositions, which are
associated to incompatible quantities, can assume on the system a given truth value
simultaneously. The propositions P(A)
J
and P(B)
K , in this sense, are called incompat-
ible.
Important remark. The propositions we are considering must be understood as
statements about physical systems to which we assign a truth value, 0 or 1, as a
consequence of a corresponding experimental measuring process. In this light the
incompatibility of two propositions does not prevent them from being both false, so
that their conjunction is always false, for example. The meaning is much deeper:
‘incompatible’ points to the fact that it makes no (physical) sense to give them,
simultaneously, any truth value whatsoever. Nor should we try to make sense of
propositions like P(A)
J
O P(B)
K
or P(A)
J
E P(B)
K
in this case, because there is no exper-
iment that can evaluate the truth of such propositions.
By this remark we cannot take, as model for the set of elementary propositions to
be tested on our quantum system, a σ-algebra of sets where ∩and ∪are interpreted
as E and O respectively. If we were to do so, we would then have to impose con-
straints on the model, for instance veto symbolic combinations built by incompatible
propositions. An alternative idea of von Neumann turns out to be successful: ele-
mentary propositions are modelled using orthogonal projectors of a complex Hilbert
space. As we will see, the set of projectors is a lattice. Although the structure is not
that of a Boolean σ-algebra, it will allow us to distinguish among compatible and
incompatible propositions, and to interpret E and O as the standard ∧and ∨provided
the former are used on compatible propositions.
7.3.2
The Non-Boolean (Non-Distributive) Lattice of
Projectors on a Hilbert Space
The set of orthogonal projectors on a Hilbert space enjoys properties that closely
resemble those of Boolean lattices. There are, however, important differences that
will enable us to model the incompatible propositions of a quantum system. First of
all we shall deal with a number of technical features of commuting projectors.

7.3 Quantum Systems: Elementary Propositions
319
Proposition 7.20 Let (H, ( | )) be a Hilbert space and L (H) the set of orthogonal
projectors on H.
The following properties hold for any P, Q ∈L (H).
(a) The following facts are equivalent:
(i) P ≤Q;
(ii) P(H) is a subspace of Q(H);
(iii) P Q = P
(iv) QP = P.
(b) The following facts are equivalent:
(i) P Q = 0;
(ii) QP = 0;
(iii) P(H) and Q(H) are orthogonal;
(iv) Q ≤I −P;
(v) P ≤I −Q.
If (i)–(v) hold, P + Q is an orthogonal projector and projects onto P(H) ⊕Q(H).
(c) If P Q = QP then P Q is an orthogonal projector and projects onto P(H) ∩
Q(H).
(d) If P Q = QP then P + Q −P Q is an orthogonal projector and projects onto
the closed space < P(H), Q(H) >.
(e) P Q = QP if and only if there exist R1, R2, R3 ∈L (H) such that:
P = R1 + R3 ,
Q = R1 + R2 with Ri(H) ⊥R j(H) for i ̸= j .
Proof (a) First, notice that if P is a projector onto M, then Pu = 0 ⇔u ∈M⊥,
by the orthogonal decomposition H = M ⊕M⊥(Theorem3.13(d)) and because the
component of u on M is precisely Pu.
(i) ⇒(ii). If P ≤Q then (u|Qu) ≥(u|Pu). Since projectors are idempotent and
self-adjoint, the latter is equivalent to (Qu|Qu) ≥(Pu|Pu), i.e. ||Qu|| ≥||Pu||.
In particular Qu = 0 implies Pu = 0, so Q(H)⊥⊂P(H)⊥. Using Theorem3.13(e)
and noting that Q(H) and P(H) are closed, we ﬁnd P(H) ⊂Q(H).
(ii) ⇒(iii). If S is a basis for P(H), complete it to a basis of Q(H) by adding
the orthogonal set S′ to S. By Proposition3.64(d), P = s-
u∈S u(u| ) and Q = s-

u∈S∪S′ u(u| ). Since S and S′ are orthogonal and orthonormal systems, and because
the inner product is continuous, the claim follows.
(iii) ⇔(iv). The statements are implied by one another by taking adjoints.
(iii) + (iv) ⇒(i). If u ∈H, (u|Qu) = ((P + P⊥)u|Q(P + P⊥)u) where P⊥= I −
P. Notice P and P⊥commute with Q by (iii) and (iv), and moreover P P⊥=
P⊥P = 0. Expanding the right side of (u|Qu) = (u|(P + P⊥)Q(P + P⊥)u), and
neglecting terms that are null by the above considerations, gives
(u|Qu) = (u|P QPu) + (u|P⊥QP⊥u) .
On the other hand by (iii) and (iv): (u|P QPu) = (u|P Pu) = (u|Pu). Therefore
(u|Qu) = (u|Pu) + (u|P⊥QP⊥u) ,

320
7
The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
so (u|Qu) ≥(u|Pu).
(b) Assuming P Q = 0 and taking adjoints gives QP = 0, hence P(H) and Q(H)
are orthogonal, for P Q = QP = 0. If P(H) and Q(H) are orthogonal we ﬁx
on each a basis, say N and N ′ respectively. By writing P and Q as prescribed
by Proposition3.64(d): P = 
u∈N(u| )u, Q = 
u∈N ′(u| )u we have immediately
P Q = QP = 0. At last, Q ≤I −P (P ≤I −Q) iff Q (resp. P) projects on a sub-
space in the orthogonal space to P(H) (resp. Q(H)) by part (a), i.e. P(H) ⊥Q(H).
Using the above expressions for P, Q, recalling N ∪N ′ is a basis of P(H) ⊕Q(H)
and using again Proposition3.64(d) implies P + Q is the orthogonal projector onto
P(H) ⊕Q(H).
(c) That P Q is an orthogonal projector (self-adjoint and idempotent) if P Q = QP,
with P, Q orthogonal projectors, is straightforward. If u ∈H, then P Qu ∈P(H) but
also P Qu = QPu ∈Q(H), so P Qu ∈P(H) ∩Q(H). We have shown P Q(H) ⊂
P(H) ∩Q(H), so to conclude it sufﬁces to show P(H) ∩Q(H) ⊂P Q(H). If
u ∈P(H) ∩Q(H) then Pu = u, Qu = u, so also Pu = P Qu = u, i.e. u ∈P Q(H).
This means P(H) ∩Q(H) ⊂P Q(H).
(d) That R := P + Q −P Q is an orthogonal projector is straightforward. Consider
the space < P(H), Q(H) >. We can build a basis as follows. Begin with a basis
N for the closed subspace P(H) ∩Q(H). Then add a basis N ′ for the rest, i.e. the
closed orthogonal complement P(H) ∩(P(H) ∩Q(H))⊥. With the same criterion
build a third basis N ′′ for Q(H) ∩(P(H) ∩Q(H))⊥. The three bases thus obtained
are pairwise orthogonal and together give a basis of < P(H), Q(H) >. All this shows
that
< P(H), Q(H) > =
(P(H) ∩Q(H)) ⊕(P(H) ∩(P(H) ∩Q(H))⊥) ⊕(Q(H) ∩(P(H) ∩Q(H))⊥)
is an orthogonal sum. With our assumptions the projector onto the ﬁrst summand
is P Q by (c). Hence the projector onto (P(H) ∩Q(H))⊥is I −P Q. Again by (c)
the orthogonal projector onto the second summand is P(I −P Q) = P −P Q, and
similarly the third projector is
Q(I −P Q) = Q −P Q .
By part (b) the projector onto the whole sum < P(H), Q(H) > is
P Q + (P −P Q) + (Q −P Q) = P + Q −P Q .
Statement (e) is another way to phrase Proposition3.66. □
Based on what we have proved, consider orthogonal projectors P, Q ∈L (H) that
commute, and suppose they are associated to statements about the physical system
(i.e. propositions, denoted by the same letters). Under the correspondence

7.3 Quantum Systems: Elementary Propositions
321
P E Q ←→
P Q ,
P O Q ←→
P + Q −P Q ,
⊣P ←→I −P ,
the right-hand sides are orthogonal projectors. The latter, moreover, satisfy prop-
erties that are formally identical to those of propositional calculus. For example,
⊣(P E Q) =⊣P O ⊣Q. In fact,
⊣P O ⊣Q ←→(I −P) + (I −Q) −(I −P)(I −Q) = 2I −P −Q −I + P Q + P + Q
= I −P Q ←→⊣(P E Q) .
and in the same way one may check every relation written previously, provided the
projectors commute. Note, further, that if P, Q commute and P ≤Q then P Q =
QP = P and P + Q −P Q = Q. If we interpret the latter by their truth value,
the above correspondence will tell that P ≤Q corresponds to Q being a logical
consequence of P.
The real difference between orthogonal projectors and the propositions of a clas-
sical system is the following. If the projectors P, Q do not commute, P Q and
P + Q −P Q are not even projectors in general, so the above correspondence breaks
down.
All this seems very interesting in order to ﬁnd a model for the propositions of
quantum system, under axiom QM2. The idea is that
the propositions of quantum systems are in 1–1 correspondence with the orthogonal
projectors of a Hilbert space. The correspondence is such that:
(i) the logical implication P ⇒Q between propositions P and Q corresponds to
the relation P ≤Q of the corresponding projectors;
(ii) two propositions are compatible if and only if the respective projectors com-
mute.
Remark 7.21 Before going any further let us shed some light on the nature of com-
muting orthogonal projectors. One might be led to suspect that P and Q com-
mute only when: (a) projection spaces are one contained in the other, or (b) pro-
jection spaces are orthogonal. With the following explicit example we show that
there are other possibilities. Consider L2(R2, dx ⊗dy), dx, dy being Lebesgue
measures on the real line, and take the sets A = {(x, y) ∈R2 | a ≤x ≤b} and
B = {(x, y) ∈R2 | c ≤y ≤d} in the plane, with a < b, c < d given. If G ⊂R2 is
a measurable set, deﬁne the linear operator
PG : L2(R2, dx ⊗dy) →L2(R2, dx ⊗dy)
by PG f = χG · f for any f ∈L2(R2, dx ⊗dy), where χG is, as always, the char-
acteristic function of G and · is the pointwise product of two maps. The operator PG
is an orthogonal projector, and moreover

322
7
The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
PG(L2(R2, dx ⊗dy)) = { f ∈L2(R2, dx ⊗dy) | ess supp f ⊂G} .
Then it is immediate to prove PA PB = PB PA = PA∩B, whilst:
(a) none of PA(L2(R2, dx ⊗dy)), PB(L2(R2, dx ⊗dy)) is included in the other,
(b) nor are they orthogonal.
■
If the speculative correspondence between propositions about quantum systems and
orthogonal projectors on a suitable Hilbert space is to be meaningful, the structural
analogies of orthogonal projectors and the σ-complete Boolean algebra of proposi-
tions must reach farther than the case of two propositions. We expect, in particular,
to be able to determine the structure of a Boolean (σ-)algebra on some set of projec-
tors representing pairwise-compatible properties. The following fact asserts that the
space of all orthogonal projectors is a non-distributive lattice, and establishes some
of its peculiarities. We shall see later that the lack of distributivity is salvaged by a
weaker form of it, the orthomodularity property.
Referring to part (c) let us remark that if A ⊂L (H) is a set of commuting
orthogonal projectors, by Zorn’s lemma there exists a maximal commutative subset
L0(H) ⊂L (H) with A ⊂L0(H): every projector in L (H) commuting with any
element in L0(H) belongs to L0(H).
Theorem 7.22 Let H be a (complex) Hilbert space.
(a) The collection L (H) of orthogonal projectors on H is an orthocomplemented,
complete (in particular σ-complete) lattice, typically non-distributive. More pre-
cisely:
(i) ≥is the order relation between projectors. If {Pi}i∈I is family of orthogonal
projectors of arbitrary cardinality:
(a) ∨i∈I Pi := supi∈I Pi is the projector onto < {Pi(H)}i∈I >,
(b) ∧i∈I Pi := infi∈I Pi is the projector onto ∩i∈I Pi(H);
(ii) the maximum and minimum elements in L (H) are: I (identity operator) and
0 (null operator) respectively;
(iii) the orthocomplement to the projector P corresponds to
¬P = I −P
(7.9)
and furthermore
¬ (∧α∈A Pα) = ∨α∈A¬Pα ,
¬ (∨α∈A Pα) = ∧α∈A¬Pα
(7.10)
for every family {Pα}α∈A ⊂L (H);
(iv) the projection spaces of P, Q ∈L (H) are orthogonal iff P, Q are orthogonal
elements in L (H);
(v) the projectors P, Q ∈L (H) commute iff they commute as lattice elements;
(vi) L (H) is not distributive if dim H ≥2.

7.3 Quantum Systems: Elementary Propositions
323
(b) In L (H) the following hold:
(i) if P, Q ∈L (H) commute:
P ∧Q = P Q ,
(7.11)
P ∨Q = P + Q −P Q ,
(7.12)
(ii) if {Qn}n∈N ⊂L (H) consists of commuting elements:
∨n∈N Qn = s- lim
n→+∞Q0 ∨· · · ∨Qn ,
(7.13)
∧n∈NQn = s- lim
n→+∞Q0 ∧· · · ∧Qn ,
(7.14)
independently of the labelling of the Qn.
(c) If L0(H) ⊂L (H) is a maximal commutative set of orthogonal projectors, then
L0(H) is a Boolean σ-subalgebra. In particular 0, I ∈L0(H), L0(H) is closed
under orthocomplementation, the inf and sup of a countable subset in L0(H) exist
in L0(H) and coincide with the inf and sup on L (H).
Proof (a) Recall ≥is a partial order on L0(H) by Proposition3.60(f). By Proposi-
tion7.20(a):
P ≤Q
⇔
P(H) ⊂Q(H) .
(7.15)
This partial ordering of orthogonal projectors corresponds one-to-one to the par-
tial order of projection spaces. The class of closed subspaces in H is a lattice: we
claim that if M, N are closed, their least upper bound is M ∨N = < M, N > and the
greatest lower bound M ∧N = M ∩N. Now, < M, N > is closed and contains M, N;
moreover, any closed space L containing M, N must contain < M, N > as well, so
M ∨N = < M, N >. By construction M ∩N closed in M and N, and if L is another
such space, it must be contained in M ∩N, whence M ∧N = M ∩N. Passing to pro-
jectors and using (7.15), we have that for P, Q ∈L (H), P ∨Q is the orthogonal
projector onto < P(H), Q(H) >, while P ∧Q the projector onto P(H) ∩Q(H).
The same argument applies to a family of orthogonal projectors {Pi}i∈I of arbitrary
cardinality. In that case ∨i∈I Pi := supi∈I{Pi} is the projector onto < {Pi(H)}i∈I >
and ∧i∈I Pi := infi∈I{Pi} the projector onto ∩i∈I Pi(H), so the lattices of orthogonal
projectors and closed subspaces are both complete (and in particular σ-complete).
In the lattice of closed subspaces the min and max are clearly {0} and H. Passing to
orthogonal projectors via (7.15), the minimum and maximum are the orthogonal pro-
jectors onto {0} and H, i.e. the null operator and the identity. Orthocomplementation
of projectors, ¬P := I −P, corresponds to complementation of closed subspaces
¬P(M) := P(M)⊥, by Proposition3.64(b). Identities (7.10) immediately descend
from Proposition7.11 by exploiting the completeness of the lattice. Part (iv) in (a)
follows directly from Proposition7.20(b), whilst (v) in (a) descends from Proposi-
tion7.20(e). To prove (vi), we shall exhibit a counterexample to distributivity.

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
Take a two-dimensional subspace S in a (complex) Hilbert space H of dimension
≥2, and identify S with C2 by ﬁxing an orthonormal basis {e1, e2}. Now consider
the subspaces: H1 :=< e1 >, H2 :=< e2 > and H3 :=< e1 + e2 >.
From
H1 ∧(H2 ∨H3) = H1 ∧S = H1
and
(H1 ∧H2) ∨(H1 ∧H3) = {0} ∨
{0} = {0} follows
H1 ∧(H2 ∨H3) ̸= (H1 ∧H2) ∨(H1 ∧H3) .
Let us prove (b) and (c) together. If the projectors P and Q commute, or if the Qn
pairwise commute, by Zorn’s lemma there is a maximal commuting chain L0(H)
containing P and Q, or {Qn}n∈N respectively. Let us ﬁrst prove that L0(H) is a
Boolean subalgebra and (i) holds. Clearly 0 and I belong to L0(H) because they
commute with everything in L0(H). The same happens for ¬P = I −P if P ∈
L0(H). We have to prove, for any P, Q ∈L0(H), the existence of the sup and the
inf of {P, Q} inside L0(H), that they are computed as prescribed in part (b), and that
these projectors actually coincide with the sup and inf of {P, Q} inside L (H). The
distributive laws of ∨and ∧follow easily from (7.12) and (7.11), from the projectors’
commutation and from the idempotency of any projector, P P = P.
By Proposition7.20(c), the projector onto M ∩N, corresponding to P ∧Q in
L (H), is exactly P Q, and this belongs to L0(H) because by construction it com-
mutes with any element of the maximal space L0(H). Therefore
P ∧Q := inf
L0(H){P, Q} = inf
L (H){P, Q} = P Q .
As P, Q commute, the projector onto < M, N >, corresponding to P ∨Q in L (H),
is P + Q −P Q by Proposition7.18(d). The latter lives in L0(H) for it commutes
with L0(H). As before,
P ∨Q := sup
L0(H)
{P, Q} = sup
L (H)
{P, Q} = P + Q −P Q .
This makes L0(H) a Boolean subalgebra and proves (b)(i).
To conclude we need to show L0(H) is σ-complete by proving (b)(ii). Consider a
countable family of projectors {Qn}n∈N and associate to each the projector Pn deﬁned
recursively by: P0 := Q0, and for n = 1, 2, . . .:
Pn := Qn(I −P1 −. . . −Pn−1) .
By induction we can prove with ease:
(i) Pn Pm = 0 if n ̸= m;
(ii) Q1 ∨· · · ∨Qn = P1 ∨· · · ∨Pn = P1 + · · · + Pn, n = 0, 1, . . ..
If we introduce bounded operators
An := P1 + · · · + Pn,

7.3 Quantum Systems: Elementary Propositions
325
then:
(iii) An = A∗
n and An An = An for any n = 0, 1, . . ., i.e. the An are orthogonal pro-
jectors, so An ≤I, for any n = 0, 1, . . . by Proposition3.64(e).
(iv) An ≤An+1 for any n = 0, 1, . . .
By virtue of Proposition3.76 there exists a bounded self-adjoint operator A deﬁned
by the strong limit:
A = s- lim
n→+∞Pn = s- lim
n→+∞Q0 ∨· · · ∨Qn .
Immediately, then, AA = A, making A an orthogonal projector in L0(H) because
(strong) limit of operators commuting with L0(H). Still by Proposition3.76, An ≤A
and in particular Qn ≤Q1 ∨· · · ∨Qn ≤A for any n ∈N. We claim A is the least
upper bound of the Qn, in L (H) and in L0(H). Suppose an orthogonal projector K ∈
L (H) satisﬁes K ≥Qn for any n ∈N. Then K Qn = Qn by Proposition7.20(a). By
deﬁnition of the Pn, K Pn = Pn and hence K An = An, so also K ≥An for any natural
number n, by Proposition7.20(a). Hence Proposition3.76 warrants K ≥A. In other
words A ∈L0(H) bounds the Qn from above, and any other upper bound K ∈L (H)
is bigger than A. By deﬁnition of supremum, A = supL (H){Qn}n∈N =: ∨n∈NQn. As
A ∈L0(H), A is also the sup in L0(H). In the above identity
∨n∈NQn = s- lim
n→+∞Q0 ∨· · · ∨Qn
the indexing order of the Qn is not relevant, given that the left-hand side, i.e. the
supremum of {Qn}n∈N, does not depend on arrangements. Formula (7.14) is easy
using ¬ and (7.13). □

Propositions and States on Quantum Systems
In this section we set out to discuss the ﬁrst two axioms of the general formulation
of QM, and describe propositions and states of quantum systems by using a suitable
Hilbert space. An important theorem due to Gleason characterises those states. We
will also show that quantum states form a convex set, and can be obtained as linear
combinations of extreme states. The latter, called pure states, are in one-to-one cor-
respondence with elements (rays) of the projective space associated to the physical
system’s Hilbert space.
7.4.1
Axioms A1 and A2: Propositions, States of a Quantum
System and Gleason’s Theorem
Based on what we saw in the previous section, we shall assume the following QM
axiom. Propositions and projectors are denoted by the same symbol, as customary.

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
A1. Let S be a quantum system described in a frame system I . Then the set of
testable propositions on S at any given time corresponds one-to-one to a subset of
the lattice L (HS) of orthogonal projectors of S on the separable complex Hilbert
space HS ̸= {0}. The space L (HS) is called the logic of elementary propositions
of the system, and HS is the Hilbert space associated to S.
Moreover:
(1) compatible propositions correspond to commuting orthogonal projectors;
(2) the logical implication of compatible propositions P ⇒Q corresponds to the
relation P ≤Q of the associated projectors;
(3) I (identity operator) and 0 (null operator) correspond to the tautology and the
contradiction;
(4) the negation ¬P of a proposition P corresponds to the projector ¬P = I −P;
(5) only when the propositions P, Q are compatible, the propositions P O Q, P E Q
make physical sense and correspond to the projectors P ∨Q, P ∧Q;
(6)if{Qn}n∈N isacountablesetofpairwise-compatiblepropositions,thepropositions
corresponding to ∨n∈NQn, ∧n∈NQn make sense.
Remark 7.23 (1) A proper explanation of why HS should be separable will be given
later, when we will consider concrete quantum system and give an explicit repre-
sentation of HS. The hypothesis is also necessary in some theoretical results in this
book.
(2) From now on we shall assume that the subset of L (HS) is the entire logic of
elementary propositions L (HS), leaving out for the moment superselection rules.
As we will see in Sect.7.6.2 the matter is quite subtle. A weaker assumption would be
to have elementary propositions described by the sublattice of orthogonal projectors
of a von Neumann algebra RS ⊂B(HS). Self-adjoint elements RS identify with
bounded observables on S, as we will have time to explain, especially in Chap.11.
(3) As we shall discuss better in Sect.7.6, the set L (HS) contains the subset of
so-called atomic propositions. These correspond (see Theorem7.56) to the atoms
of the lattice. Atomic propositions are deﬁned as follows: P ̸= 0 is atomic if there
is no P′ ∈L (HS) such that P′ ⇒P apart from P′ = 0, P′ = P. It turns out that
atomic propositions P, Q commute (P Q = QP) if and only if they are either mutu-
ally exclusive P Q = 0 or they coincide P = Q. In L (HS) atomic propositions
are the orthogonal projectors onto one-dimensional subspaces, which implies that
R, S ∈L (HS) are compatible if and only if they can be written, separately, as dis-
junctions (at most countable) of sets NR, NS of atomic propositions, so that the atomic
propositions of the union NR ∪NS are pairwise compatible. The proof, by the above
argument, follows immediately by Proposition3.66. That atomic propositions exist
in classical systems, by the way, is not at all obvious (see [Jau73]).
The existence of a subset of atoms is physically remarkable. If we restrict the
family of physically admissible elementary propositions to some proper sublattice
of L (H), atoms may still exist but they might not necessarily be one-dimensional
projectors.
(4) Apart from S, also the Hilbert space HS depends on the frame system of choice.
Picking a different (inertial) frame system boils down to having a new, yet isomorphic
Hilbert space, as we will see in Chaps.12 and 13.

7.4 Propositions and States on Quantum Systems
327
Another formulation, alternative to ours, to build the quantum formalism is the
following. Given a quantum system S, one assigns to any instant t ∈R a Hilbert
space HS(t) that does not depend on any frame system. This reminds of absolute
space at time t in classical physics, a notion that is independent of frames. The way
the various HS(t) are related depends on the frame system and the time evolution,
the latter described by isomorphisms between spaces at different times t; it does
not depend upon the chosen frame, in contrast to what we will obtain in Chap.13
(albeit the formalism will be equivalent). If we chose to use frame-independent (but
time-dependent) Hilbert spaces {HS(t)}t∈R, we would not be able to describe the
evolution by a one-parameter group of unitary operators on the same Hilbert space.
This is precisely what happens after having ﬁxed a frame and the Hilbert space once
and for all, as we will see in Chap.13.4
■
Let us pass to the second axiom about quantum states. The crux of the matter is that
a quantum state at time t gives the “probability” that every proposition of the system
is true. Hence the idea is to generalise the notion of σ-additive probability measure.
Instead of deﬁning the measure on a σ-algebra, we must think of it as living on the
set of associated projectors. We know every maximal set of compatible propositions
deﬁnes a σ-ﬁnite Boolean algebra, itself an extension of a σ-algebra where measures
are deﬁned. So here is the natural principle.
A2 (measure-theory version). A state μ at time t on a quantum system S is a
σ-additive probability measure on L (HS), i.e., a map μ : L (HS) →[0, 1] such
that:
(1) μ(I) = 1;
(2) if {Pi}i∈N ⊂L (HS) satisfy Pi Pj = 0, i ̸= j, then
μ
	
s-
+∞

i=0
Pi

=
+∞

i=0
μ(Pi) .
Remark 7.24 (1) Demand (1) just says the tautology is true on every state.
(2) Demand (2) clearly holds for ﬁnitely many propositions: it is enough that Pi = 0
from a certain index i onwards.
(3) We may rephrase (2) as:
μ (∨i∈NPi) =
+∞

i=1
μ(Pi) ,
for any collection {Pi}i∈N ⊂L (HS) of compatible, mutually-exclusive propositions,
so that +∞
i=0 Pi = ∨i∈NPi exists by Theorem7.22.
4Although we will not do so, one could also use two-parameter groupoids of unitary transformations
between different Hilbert spaces.

328

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
The proof of the existence of +∞
i=0 Pi is spelt out next, at any rate. Under the
assumptions, partial sums give self-adjoint idempotent operators, hence orthogonal
projectors. Therefore N
i=0 Pi ≤I by Proposition3.64(e). Moreover N+1
i=0 Pi ≥
N
i=0 Pi, as is easy to see. So by Proposition3.76 the sequence admits a strong limit.
Immediately, this limit is idempotent and self-adjoint, hence a projector.
(4) Everystate μ clearly determines the equivalent of a positive σ-additiveprobability
measure on any maximal commutative set of projectors L0(Hs), which, as seen
before, generalises a σ-algebra. Thus we have extended the notion of probability
measure, as suggested by the term σ-additive probability measure itself.
(5) The reader should however be careful when identifying the probability measure
μ on the non-Boolean lattice L (HS) with an honest probability measure on a σ-
algebra: the fact that we now consider quantum incompatible propositions alters
drastically the rules of conditional probability. The probability that “P is true when
Q holds” abides by a different set of rules from the classical theory if P and Q are
incompatible in quantum sense.
(6)IfHS isseparable,aσ-additiveprobabilitymeasureμonL (HS)inthesenseofA2
is completely determined by its range over atomic propositions (see Remark7.23(3)),
i.e. over orthogonal projectors onto subspaces of dimension 1 in H. The proof follows
directly property (2) in A2, to which μ is subjected.
■
Important remark. When we assign a state there will be propositions with prob-
ability 1 of being true, and propositions with probability less than 1, if the system
undergoes a measurement. We may view the ﬁrst class as properties that the system
really possesses in the state considered.
Under the standard interpretation of QM, where probability has no epistemic
meaning, we are forced to conclude that the properties relative to the second class of
propositions are not deﬁned for the state examined.
An important example for physics is this. Consider a system formed by a quantum
particle on the real line and take propositions PE of the form: “the particle’s position
is in the Borel set E ∈B(R)”. If the state μ assigns to each PE, E bounded, a
probability less than 1 (such states come by easily, as we shall see with Heisenberg’s
uncertainty principle/theorem) then we must conclude that the particle’s position, in
state μ, is not deﬁned.
From this point of view, the spatial description of particles as points in a manifold
– here R, representing the “physical space at rest” of a frame system – does not play
a central role anymore, unlike in classical physics. In some sense all the properties
of a system (which may vary with the state) are put on an equal footing, and the
“space” in which system and states are described is a Hilbert space.
■
From the mathematical perspective the ﬁrst question to raise is whether maps such
as μ in A2 exist at all.

7.4 Propositions and States on Quantum Systems

Given a Hilbert space H we will show they do exist. Recall that B1(H) denotes
trace-class operators on H (Chap.4).
Proposition 7.25 Let H be a Hilbert space and T ∈B1(H) a positive (hence self-
adjoint) operator with trace 1. Deﬁne μT : L (H) →R by μT (P) := tr(T P) for
any P ∈L (H). Then:
(a) μT (P) ∈[0, 1] for any P ∈L (H),
(b) μT (I) = 1,
(c) if {Pi}i∈N ⊂L (H) satisﬁes Pi Pj = 0, i ̸= j, then
μT
	
s-

i=0
Pi

=
+∞

i=1
μT (Pi) .
Proof (a) The operator T P is of trace class for any P ∈L (H) by Theorem4.34(b),
for P is bounded, hence we can compute tr(T P). The positivity of T ensures the
eigenvalues of T are non-negative (Proposition3.60(c)). We claim they all belong to
[0, 1]. First, T is compact and self-adjoint (as positive). Using the decomposition of
Theorem4.23, since |A| = A (A ≥0) and so in A = U|A| we have U = I,
T =

λ∈σp(A)
mλ

i=1
λ (uλ,i| ) uλ,i .
(7.16)
The ﬁnite (or countable) set σp(A) consists of the eigenvalues of A, and if λ > 0,
{uλ,i}i=1,...,mλ is a basis of the λ-eigenspace. The convergence is in the uniform
topology. Let us write the above expansion as
T =

j
λ j(u j| )u j .
(7.17)
We labelled over N (or a ﬁnite subset thereof, if dim(H) < +∞) the set of eigen-
vectors u j = uλ j,i, λ j > 0, where λ j is the eigenvalue of u j. Moreover, the set of
eigenvectors was completed to a basis of H by adding a, generally uncountable, basis
for the kernel of T .
Computing the trace of T with respect to the u j gives
1 = tr(T ) =

j
λ j ,
so λ j ∈[0, 1]. Note that the above equation proves part (b) as well, for T I = I. Take
now P ∈L (H) and compute the trace of T P in said basis:
tr(T P) =

λ j(u j|Pu j) .

Both i and j range over a ﬁnite or countable set (only the eigenvalues λ j > 0 and the
corresponding ﬁnite or countable set of eigenvectors appear in (7.18)). We assume
that the set of indices is N in either case, and the remaining possibilities can be treated
similarly. We may interpret the above double sum as an iterated integral with respect
to the counting measure μ on N:
μT (P) =

N

N
λ j(u j|Piu j)dμ(i)

dμ( j) .
Since N is σ-ﬁnite we can deﬁne the product measure μ ⊗μ and we are allowed
to swap the integrals, provided the function N × N ∋(i, j) →|λ j(u j|Piu j)| is inte-
grable with respect to the product measure, in view of the Fubini–Tonelli theorem.
The function is, again by Fubini–Tonelli, μ ⊗μ-integrable if

However, λ j(u j|Piu j) = λ j(Pju j|Piu j) ≥0 because T ≥0, so we can replace
|λ j(u j|Piu j)| by λ j(u j|Piu j) above. The required condition is, indeed, fulﬁlled

The next result, due to Gleason [Gle57, Dvu93], is truly paramount, in that it provides
a complete characterisation of the functions that satisfy axiom A2.
Theorem 7.26 (Gleason) Let H be a Hilbert space of ﬁnite dimension ̸= 2, or
inﬁnite-dimensional and separable.
For any map μ : L (H) →[0, +∞] with μ(I) < +∞satisfying statement (2) in
A2, there exists a positive operator T ∈B1(H) such that
μ(P) = tr(T P) for any P ∈L (H).
Sketch of proof. Take a Hilbert space H, either separable and inﬁnite-dimensional, or
just ﬁnite-dimensional. If dim H = 1 the thesis is obvious as H is isomorphic to C.
The convex set of positive trace-class operators is made by multiplicative operators
Sm : C ∋z →mz ∈C where tr(Sm) = m ≥0. On the other hand L (C) = {0, 1},
viewed as multiplicative operators. There is only one map μ : L (C) →[0, +∞]
for every ﬁxed value 0 ≤m < +∞satisfying statement (2) in A2, viz. the map
μ(0) := 0, μ(1) = m. For each such μ, T := Sμ satisﬁes Gleason’s thesis.
Let us consider the case dim H > 2. Deﬁne a non-negative frame function on H to
be a mapping f : SH →[0, +∞), SH := {x ∈H | ||x|| = 1}, for which there exists
W ∈[0, +∞) such that

i∈K
f (xi) = W
for any Hilbert basis {xi}i∈K ⊂H. A lengthy argument relying on results of von
Neumann (cf. Gleason, op. cit.) proves the following lemma.
Lemma 7.27 On any Hilbert space, either separable or of ﬁnite dimension > 2, for
any non-negative frame function f there exists a bounded, self-adjoint operator T
such that f (x) = (x|T x), for every x ∈SH.
Consider the projectors Px := (x| ) x, x ∈SH. With the assumption made on μ it is
straightforward that f (x) := μ(Px) is a non-negative frame function, since μ ≥0
and

i∈K
f (xi) =

i∈K
μ(Pxi) = μ
	
i∈K
Pxi

= μ (I) < +∞.
By the lemma there is a self-adjoint operator T such that μ(Px) = (x|T x) for
any x ∈SH. Since (x|T x) ≥0 for any x, then T is positive, so T = |T | (in fact:

332

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
|T|2 = T ∗T by polar decomposition, but T ∗T = T 2 because positive roots are
unique (Theorem3.77)). If {xi}i∈K ⊂H is a Hilbert basis,

i∈K
(xi|T xi) =

By Deﬁnition4.32 then T = |T | is of trace class. Take now P ∈L (H), pick a Hilbert
basis {xi}i∈J of P(H) and complete it by adding a Hilbert basis {xi}i∈J ′ of P(H)⊥.
Then J is countable (or ﬁnite) by Theorem3.30, plus:
P = s-

i∈J
Pxi
by Proposition3.64(d). Eventually,
Pxi Px j = 0
if i ̸= j are in J. Since Pxi = xi if i ∈J, and Pxi = 0 if i ∈J ′, we have
μ(P) =

i∈J
μ(Pxi ) =

i∈J
(xi|T xi) =

i∈J∪J ′
(xi|T Pxi) = tr(T P) .
The sketch of the proof ends here.
□
Remark 7.28 (1) Gleason’s proof works for separable real and quaternionic Hilbert
spaces, too [Var07].
(2) The operator T has trace 1 if μ(I) = 1, as in the case of A2.
(3) If the Hilbert space is complex, as in A2 and always in this text, the operator
T associated to μ is unique: any other T ′ of trace class such that μ(P) = tr(T ′P)
for any P ∈L (H) must also satisfy (x|(T −T ′)x) = 0 for any x ∈H. If x = 0
this is clear, while if x ̸= 0 we may complete the vector x/||x|| to a basis, in which
tr((T −T ′)Px) = 0 reads ||x||−2(x|(T −T ′)x) = 0, where Px is the projector onto
< x >. By Exercise3.21 we obtain T −T ′ = 0.
(4) Imposing dim H ̸= 2 is mandatory, as the next example shows. On C2 the orthog-
onal projectors are 0, I and any matrix of the form

There is a one-to-one correspondence between projectors Pn and points n ∈S2 on
the unit two-sphere. The functions μ of Gleason’s theorem can be thought of as
maps on S2 ∪{0, I}. Gleason’s assumptions boil down to μ(0) = 0, μ(I) = 1 and

It is easy to prove, however, that there are no operators ρu like (7.20) such that
μ(Pn) := tr(ρu Pn) for any projector Pu; that is to say, there are no u ∈R3, |u| ≤1,
such that
(1 + u · n) =

1 + (v · n)3
for any n ∈S2.

Gleason’s theorem, the fact that the trace-class operator representing a state is unique
as discussed Remark7.28(3), plus the fact that, in absence of superselection rules,
every known quantum system has a Hilbert space satisfying Gleason’s assumptions,5
lead to a reformulation of axiom A2 involving a technically more useful notion of
state.
A2. A state ρ at time t, on a quantum system S with associated Hilbert space HS, is
a positive trace-class operator on HS with unit trace.
The probability that the proposition P ∈L (HS) is true on state ρ equals tr(ρP).
In conclusion, and more generally, we can say the following.
Deﬁnition 7.29 (State) Let H be a Hilbert space (not necessarily separable nor ﬁnite-
dimensional). A positive trace-class operator with trace 1 is called a state on H. The
set of states on H is denoted by S(H).

2. The same occurs to the Hilbert space in which the polarisation of light is described (cf. helicity
of photons). When these systems are described in full, however, for instance by including freedom
degrees relative to position or momentum, they are representable on a separable Hilbert space of
inﬁnite dimension.

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
We have the following almost obvious result (valid also for H non-separable or
dim H = 2) which proves that there is no redundancy in our deﬁnition of states and
elementary propositions.
Proposition 7.30 If H is a Hilbert space, the following facts hold.
(a) S(H) separates L (H): if P, P′ ∈L (H) satisfy tr(ρP) = tr(ρP′) for all ρ ∈
S(H), then P = P′.
(b) L (H) separates S(H): if ρ, ρ′ ∈L (H) satisfy tr(ρP) = tr(ρ′P) for all P ∈
L (H), then ρ = ρ′.
Proof Both statements immediately arise form the property that if A, A′ ∈B(H)
satisfy (ψ|(A −A′)ψ) = 0 for every ψ ∈H, then A = A′ (Exercise3.21). To prove
(a) it sufﬁces to use states ρ = ψ(ψ|·). For (b) it is enough to exploit projectors
P = ψ(ψ|·) with ψ ∈H and ||ψ|| = 1.
Remark 7.31 For H separable, the statement of the theorem is still valid when we
replace S(H) with the space of σ-additive probability measures over L (H): part
(b) is nothing but the deﬁnition of measure; part (a) is a consequence of Propo-
sition7.30(a), because positive trace-class operators with trace 1 are σ-additive
probability measures even when dim H = 2 (a case not covered by Gleason’s
theorem).

7.4.2
The Kochen–Specker Theorem
Gleason’s theorem has a momentous consequence in physics, which distinguishes the
states of classical systems from quantum ones. Classical systems admit completely
deterministic states, described by what we have called sharp states: Dirac measures
with support at a point in phase space at the time considered. Each such measure
maps sets either to 0 or to 1. These are states on which every statement is either
true or false, and there is no intermediate option. States of this kind do not occur in
quantum systems because of the following important fact [KoSp67].
Theorem 7.32 (Kochen–Specker) If H is a Hilbert space, separable or of ﬁnite
dimension > 2, there is no function μ : L (H) →[0, 1] fulﬁlling (1) and (2) in axiom
A2 (measure-theory version) and taking values in {0, 1}.
Proof If x belongs to SH (unit length) and Px is the orthogonal projector (x|·)x, any
such μ gives by Gleason’s theorem (the dimension is > 2) a map SH ∋x →μ(Px) =
(x|T x), where μ determines a unique T ∈B1(H) with T ≥0, trT = 1. This map is
patently continuous for the topology of SH induced by the ambient H. We claim SH
is path-connected, i.e., for any x, y ∈SH there is a continuous path γ : [a, b] →SH
starting at γ (a) = x and ending at γ (b) = y. If so, since SH ∋x →μ(Px) = (x|T x)
is continuous, its image is clearly path-connected (as composite of paths in SH with μ
itself). As this image belongs in {0, 1}, the possibilities are that it is {0, 1}, or {0}, or

7.4 Propositions and States on Quantum Systems
335
{1}. But there is no path joining 0 and 1 contained in {0, 1}, so necessarily μ(Px) = 0
for any x ∈SH, or μ(Px) = 1 for any x ∈SH. In the former case (x|T x) = 0 for any
x, hence tr(T) = 0, violating tr(T) = 1. In the latter case (x|T x) = 1 for any x,
again contradicting tr(T) = 1 by dimensional reasons.
To conclude we must then show SH is indeed path-connected. Taking x, y ∈SH
we have two options. The ﬁrst is that x = eiα0 y for some α0 > 0, so x is joined to y
by the curve [0, α0] ∋α →eiαy. The curve is continuous in the Hilbert topology and
totally contained in S. The second option is that x is a linear combination of y and
some y′ ∈SH orthogonalto y,obtainedfromcompleting y toanorthonormalbasisfor
the span of y, x. Since ||x|| = ||y|| = ||y′|| = 1 and y ⊥y′, then x = eiα(cos β)y +
eiδ(sin β)y′ for three real numbers α, β, δ. But then x is joined to y by the continuous
curve, all contained in SH, deﬁned by varying each of the three parameters on suitable
adjacent intervals. □
In particular, if H is separable or of ﬁnite dimension > 2, it is impossible to deﬁne
a state such that in each maximal set of compatible elementary propositions L0(H),
every proposition P ∈L0(H) is certainly either true or false. This is because every
P ∈L (H) belongs to a maximal set L0(H) and the theorem above holds. This no-go
result is relevant when one tries to construct classical models of QM by introducing
“hidden variables” of classical type, essentially, because these severely restrict the
models. The result by Kochen and Specker (obtained independently from Gleason’s
theorem, with a much more complicated and involved proof) implies that it is possible
to embed the set of quantum-mechanical observables in a set of classical quantities
only in presence of constraints on the simultaneous values attained by the variables.
Hidden variables must satisfy a constraint known as contextuality and thus cannot
be completely classic. For a general discussion on the use of hidden variables and
the obstruction due to the lack of dispersion-free states, i.e. sharp states (also in
more general contexts than the formulation of QM in Hilbert spaces) we recommend
[Jau73, Chap.7] and [BeCa81, Chap.25].
7.4.3
Pure States, Mixed States, Transition Amplitudes
Let us now study the set of states S(HS) when HS is the Hilbert space associated to
the quantum system S. A few reminders will be useful.
Given a vector space X, a ﬁnite linear combination 
i∈F αixi is called convex if
αi ∈[0, 1], i ∈F, and 
i∈F αi = 1.
Moreover (Deﬁnition2.65) C ⊂X is called convex if for any pair x, y ∈C, λx +
(1 −λ)y ∈C for all λ ∈[0, 1] (and thus every convex combination of elements in
C belongs to C).
If C is convex, e ∈C is called extreme if it cannot be written as e = λx + (1 −
λ)y, with λ ∈(0, 1), x, y ∈C \ {e}.

Deﬁnition 7.33 (Ray of a projective space) Let X be a vector space over K = C or
R. Consider the equivalence relation:
u ∼v ⇔v = αu for some α ∈K \ {0}.
The quotient space X/∼is the projective space over X. We call elements of X/∼
other than [{0}] (the equivalence class of the null vector) rays of X.
Proposition 7.34 Let (H, ( | )) be a Hilbert space.
(a) S(H) is a convex closed subset in B1(H).
(b) The extreme points in S(H) are those of the form:
ρψ := (ψ| )ψ ,
for every vector ψ ∈H with ||ψ|| = 1.
This sets up a bijection between extreme states and rays of H, which maps the extreme
state (ψ| )ψ to the ray [ψ].
(c) Any state ρ ∈S(H) satisﬁes
ρ ≥ρρ,
and is extreme if and only if
ρρ = ρ .
(d) Any state ρ ∈S(H) is a linear combination of extreme states, including inﬁnite
combinations in the strong operator topology (or the uniform one if we rearrange
the sum in accordance with the decomposition of Theorem4.23). In particular there
is always a decomposition
ρ =

φ∈N
pφ(φ| )φ,
where N is an orthonormal eigenvector basis for ρ, pφ ∈[0, 1] is the eigenvalue of
φ ∈N, every pφ-eigenspace (pφ ̸= 0) is ﬁnite-dimensional, and

φ∈N
pφ = 1 .
Proof (a) Take two states ρ, ρ′. It is clear λρ + (1 −λ)ρ′ is of trace class because
trace-class operators form a subspace in B(H) (Theorem4.34). By the trace’s lin-
earity (Proposition4.36):
tr[λρ + (1 −λ)ρ′] = λtrρ + (1 −λ)trρ′ = λ1 + (1 −λ)1 = 1 .
If f ∈H and λ ∈[0, 1], since ρ and ρ′ are positive:
( f |(λρ + (1 −λ)ρ′) f ) = λ( f |ρ f ) + (1 −λ)( f |ρ′ f ) ≥0 .

7.4 Propositions and States on Quantum Systems
337
Hence λρ + (1 −λ)ρ′ is a state if ρ, ρ′ are states and λ ∈[0, 1]. To conclude, we
prove that S(H) is closed in the natural topology of B1(H). Let ρ be an oper-
ator in B1(H) such that ρn →ρ as n →+∞for some sequence of elements
ρn ∈S(H). Consequently ρn →ρ also holds in the natural topology of B(H)
((Proposition4.38(d)) and hence in the weak topology. Therefore, as ρn ≥0 for
every n ∈N, we ﬁnally have that ρ ≥0. The fact that tr(ρ) = 1 immediately fol-
lows from tr(ρn) = 1 for every n, since the trace is continuous with respect to || · ||1.
We conclude that ρ ∈S(H). But ρ was an arbitrary limit point of S(H), so S(H) is
closed in B1(H).
(b)–(d) Consider ρ ∈S(H). The operator ρ is compact and self-adjoint (as positive).
Using the decomposition of Theorem4.23, and since |ρ| = ρ (ρ ≥0), so U = I in
the polar decomposition of ρ = U|ρ|, we ﬁnd:
ρ =

λ∈σp(ρ)
mλ

i=1
λ (uλ,i| ) uλ,i .
(7.21)
Above, σp(ρ) is the set of eigenvectors of ρ, and if λ > 0, {uλ,i}i=1,...,mλ is a basis of
the λ-eigenspace. At last, convergence is understood in the uniform topology if the
eigenspaces are ordered in accordance with Theorem4.23. If not, convergence is in
the strong operator topology (we shall see in Example8.60(1) that this is customary
for spectral expansions). We have proved (d).
Completing ∪λ>0{uλ,i}i=1,...,mλ by adding a basis for Kerρ, by Proposition4.36
we obtain:
1 = tr(ρ) =

λ∈σp(ρ)
mλλ .
(7.22)
Suppose now ρψ := (ψ| )ψ , ||ψ|| = 1. Immediately, ρψ ∈S(H). We want to prove
ρψ is extreme in S(H). So assume there are ρ, ρ′ ∈S(H) and λ ∈(0, 1) such that
ρψ = λρ + (1 −λ)ρ′ .
We claim ρ = ρ′ = ρψ.
Consider the orthogonal projector Pψ = (ψ| )ψ. It is clear (completing ψ to a
basis) that tr(ρψ Pψ) = 1, so
1 = λtr(ρPψ) + (1 −λ)tr(ρ′Pψ) .
As λ ∈(0, 1) and 0 ≤tr(ρPψ) ≤1, we have 0 ≤tr(ρ′Pψ) ≤1, which is possible
onlyif tr(ρPψ) = tr(ρ′Pψ) = 1.Soletusprovethat tr(ρPψ) = 1andtr(ρ′Pψ) = 1
imply ρ = ρ′ = ρψ.
Decomposing ρ as in (7.21), tr(ρPψ) = 1 becomes

where: the eigenvectors u j = uλ,i, λ > 0, were labelled by N or a ﬁnite subset, λ j is
the eigenvalue of u j and we added to these eigenvectors a basis for the null space of ρ.
The overall basis may be uncountable, but the values j for which λ j ̸= 0 form a ﬁnite
or countable set, because ρ is compact. Also the indices j such that |(u j|ψ)| ̸= 0
are countable at most. For the rest of the proof only the union of these two subsets
of indices is relevant, so we shall assume that j ∈N (the ﬁnite case being trivial, by
the way). By assumption we have

λ j = 1 ,
(7.24)

|(u j|ψ)|2 = 1 .

j
λ2
j ≤1 ,
(7.26)

j
|(u j|ψ)|4 ≤1 .
(7.27)
Therefore the sequences of the λ j and |(u j|ψ)|2 belong to ℓ2(N). Identity (7.23),
plus (7.26), (7.27) and the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality in ℓ2(N), give

j = 1 ,
(7.28)

j
|(u j|ψ)|4 = 1 .
(7.29)
Since λ j ∈[0, 1] for any j ∈N, (7.24) and (7.28) are consistent only if all λi vanish
except one, say λp = 1. Likewise, since |(u j|ψ)|2 ∈[0, 1] for any j ∈N, (7.25) and
(7.29) are consistent only if all |(u j|ψ)| are zero except for |(uk|ψ)| = 1. As the ui
are a basis and ||ψ|| = 1, necessarily ψ = αuk, with |α| = 1. Clearly, then, k = p,
for otherwise tr(ρPψ) = 0. But
ρ =

j
λ j(u j| )u j ,
so eventually
ρ = λk(uk| )uk = 1 · (uk| )uk = α−1α−1(ψ| )ψ = |α|−1(ψ| )ψ = (ψ| )ψ = ρψ .
In the same way we can prove ρ′ = ρψ.

7.4 Propositions and States on Quantum Systems
339
If a state ρ is not of the type (ψ| )ψ, we can still decompose it orthogonally as
ρ =

j
λ j(u j| )u j ,
where at least two vectors u p, uq do not vanish and are perpendicular. Hence in
particular λp, 1 −λp ∈(0, 1). Then we can write ρ as
ρ = λp(u p| )u p + (1 −λp)

j̸=p
λ j
(1 −λp)(u j| )u j .
As already said (u p| )u p is a state, and easily, we also have
ρ′ :=

j̸=p
λ j
(1 −λp)(u j| )u j
is a state of S(H) (obviously ρ′ ̸= (u p| )u p by construction, as uq ≁u p). So we
have proved ρ is not extreme.
The function f mapping the extreme state (ψ| )ψ to the ray [ψ] is well deﬁned.
In fact, let us ﬁrst notice that ||ψ|| = 1 by deﬁnition of extreme state, so ψ ̸= 0
and [ψ] is a ray. Extremes states may be expressed in different ways: namely (as is
immediate to see from ||φ|| = 1) (ψ| )ψ = (φ| )φ iff ψ = eiαφ for some α ∈R.
But then by deﬁnition of ray [ψ] = [φ]. We claim f is one-to-one: if φ, ψ are unit
vectors and [ψ] = [φ], then ψ = eiαφ for some α ∈R, so (ψ| )ψ = (φ| )φ. The
function is also onto, because if [φ] is a ray, ||φ|| ̸= 0 so there exists ψ ∈[φ] with
||ψ|| = 1. Then f ((ψ| )ψ) = [φ] since ψ = αφ for some non-zero α ∈C.
(c) Begin with the second claim. If ρ is extreme, ρρ = ρ using the form in part (b)
for extreme points. Decomposing a state ρ as:
ρ =

j
λ j(u j| )u j
(see the meaning above) gives
ρρ =

λ2
j(u j| )u j .

with λ j ∈[0, 1]. This is possible only if all λ j are zero but one, λk = 1. Then
ρ =

j
λ j(u j| )u j = 1 · (uk| )uk ,
which is an extreme state by (b).
Now to the ﬁrst claim. Let x = 
j α ju j be a point in H (the u j are a basis of H).
Since λ j ∈[0, 1],
(x|ρρx) =

λ j(x|u j)(u j|x) = (x|ρx) .
Therefore ρρ ≤ρ. □
Remark 7.35 Let || ||i refer to the spaces of compact operators Bi(H), for i = 1, 2.
The following four facts are equivalent:
(i) ρ ∈S(H) is extreme,
(ii) ||ρ|| = ||ρ||1,
(iii) ||ρ||2 = ||ρ||1,
(iv) ||ρ|| = ||ρ||2,
(v) ||ρ||2 = 1.
The elementary proof is left to the reader.
■
Now we have a deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 7.36 Let (H, ( | )) be a Hilbert space.
(a) Extreme elements in S(H) are called pure states, and their set is indicated by
Sp(H). Non-extreme states are mixed states, mixtures or nonpure states.
(b) Suppose:
ψ =

i∈I
αiφi ,
where I is ﬁnite, or countable (and the series converges), the vectors φi ∈H are non-
null and 0 ̸= αi ∈C for any i ∈I. One says the state (ψ| )ψ/||ψ||2 is a coherent
superposition of the states (φi| )φi/||φi||2.
(c) If ρ ∈S(H) satisﬁes:
ρ =

i∈I
piρi
with I ﬁnite, ρi ∈S(H), 0 ̸= pi ∈[0, 1] for any i ∈I, and 
i pi = 1, the state ρ
is called incoherent superposition of the ρi (possibly pure).
(d) If ψ, φ ∈H satisfy ||ψ|| = ||φ|| = 1:
(i) the complex number (ψ|φ) is the transition amplitude or probability ampli-
tude of state (φ| )φ on state (ψ| )ψ;
(ii) the non-negative real number |(ψ|φ)|2 is the transition probability of state
(φ| )φ on state (ψ| )ψ.

7.4 Propositions and States on Quantum Systems

Remark 7.37 (1) The vectors of the Hilbert space of a quantum system associated
to pure states are often referred to, in physics, as wavefunctions. The reason for
the name is due to the earliest formulation of QM in terms of Wave Mechanics (see
Chap.6). Similarly, operators in S(H) are very often called statistical operators or
density matrices in physics’ literature. We will use this language sometimes.
(2) The possibility of creating pure states by non-trivial combinations of vectors
associated to other pure states is called, in the jargon of QM, superposition principle
of (pure) states.
(3) In (c), in case ρi = ψi(ψi| ), we do not require (ψi|ψ j) = 0 if i ̸= j. However
it is immediate to see that if I is ﬁnite, if ρi is a mixed or pure state and if pi ∈[0, 1]
for any i ∈I, 
i pi = 1, then:
ρ =

i∈I
piρi
is of trace class (obvious: trace-class operators are a vector space and every ρi is of
trace class), positive (as positive linear combination of positive operators), and it has
unit trace: this because by the trace’s linearity (Proposition4.36) we have
trρ = tr
	
i∈I
piρi

=

i∈I
pitrρi =

i∈I
pi · 1 = 1 .
The decomposition of ρ over an eigenvector basis can be considered a limiting case
of the above: when I is countable, in fact, ρi = ψi(ψi| ) and (ψi|ψ j) = δi j.
It is important to remark that in general, a given mixed state admits several
incoherent decompositions by pure and nonpure states.
(4) Consider a pure state ρψ ∈Sp(H), written ρψ = (ψ| )ψ for some ψ ∈H with
||ψ|| = 1. What we want to emphasise is that this pure state is also an orthogonal
projector Pψ := (ψ| )ψ, so it must correspond to a proposition about the system.
The naïve and natural interpretation6 of the proposition is: “the system’s state is the
pure state given by the vector ψ”.
This interpretation is due, if ρ ∈S(H), to the fact that tr(ρPψ) = 1 ⇔ρ =
(ψ| )ψ. In fact, if ρ = (ψ| )ψ, by completing ψ to a basis and taking the trace,
we have tr(ρPψ) = 1. Conversely, suppose tr(ρPψ) = 1 for the state ρ. Then ρ =
(ψ| )ψ from the proof of Proposition7.34.
(5) Part (4) allows to interpret the squared modulus of the transition amplitude (φ|ψ).
If ||φ|| = ||ψ|| = 1, as the deﬁnition of transition amplitude imposes, tr(ρψ Pφ) =
|(φ|ψ)|2, where ρψ := (ψ| )ψ and Pφ = (φ| )φ. Using (4) we conclude:
|(φ|ψ)|2 is the probability that the state, given (at time t) by the vector ψ, following
a measurement (at time t) on the system becomes determined by φ.
6We cannot but notice how this interpretation muddles the semantic and syntactic levels. Although
this could be problematic in a formulation within formal logic, the use physicists make of the
interpretation eschews the issue.

342
7
The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
Notice |(φ|ψ)|2 = |(ψ|φ)|2, so the probability transition of the state determined
by ψ on the state determined by φ coincides with the analogous probability where
the vectors are swapped. This fact is, a priori, highly non-evident in physics.
■
To conclude we state and prove an elementary but useful technical result concerning
states.
Proposition 7.38 LetHbeaHilbertspace,takeρ ∈S(H), P ∈L (H)andconsider
the eigenvectors decomposition
ρ =

φ∈N
pφ(φ| )φ
of Proposition7.34(d). The following facts are equivalent.
(a) tr(Pρ) = 1.
(b) φ ∈P(H) for every eigenvector φ of ρ in the basis N.
(c) PρP = ρ.
Proof Evidently (b) implies (a). Indeed, if (b) holds true, we have
tr(Pρ) =

φ∈N
pφ||Pφ||2 =

φ∈N
pφ||φ||2 =

φ∈N
pφ = 1 .
Let us prove the converse implication. First of all, observe that, for P ∈L (H)
and ψ ∈H, we immediately have ||Pψ −ψ||2 = ||Pψ||2 + ||ψ||2 −(Pψ|ψ) −
(ψ|Pψ) = ||Pψ||2 + ||ψ||2 −(Pψ|Pψ) −(Pψ|Pψ) = ||Pψ||2 + ||ψ||2 −2
||Pψ||2. We have found that ||Pψ −ψ||2 = ||ψ||2 −||Pψ||2. We conclude that
ψ ∈P(H) is equivalent to ||Pψ|| = ||ψ||. Now assume that (a) is valid. It can be
rephrased as
1 = tr(Pρ) =

φ∈N
pφ||Pφ||2 .
Since ||Pφ||2 ≤||φ||2 = 1 and pφ ≥0 with 
φ∈N pφ = 1, the identity above can be
fulﬁlled only if ||Pφ||2 = 1 for every φ ∈N. In other words ||Pφ|| = ||φ|| and thus
Pφ ∈P(H) for every φ ∈N. To conclude, notice that (b) implies (c) immediately by
the eigenvector decomposition of ρ. Moreover, if (c) is valid, tr(Pρ) = tr(P Pρ) =
tr(PρP) = trρ = 1, so that (a) is also true. □
7.4.4
Axiom A3: Post-Measurement States and Preparation
of States
The standard formulation of QM assumes a third axiom, introduced by von Neumann
and generalised by Lüders [BeCa81], about what occurs to a system S, in state

7.4 Propositions and States on Quantum Systems

ρ ∈S(HS) at time t, when we measure a proposition P ∈L (HS) that is true (so in
particular tr(ρP) > 0, prior to the measurement).
A3. If the quantum system S is in state ρ ∈S(HS) at time t and a proposition
P ∈L (HS) is true after a measurement at time t, the system’s state immediately
afterwards is:
ρP :=
PρP
tr(ρP) .
(7.30)
In particular, if ρ is pure and determined by the unit vector ψ, immediately after
measurement the state is still pure, and determined by:
ψP =
Pψ
||Pψ|| .
Obviously, in either case ρP and ψP deﬁne states. In the former, in fact, ρP is positive
of trace class, with unit trace, while in the latter ||ψP|| = 1.
Remark 7.39 (1) As already highlighted, measuring a property of a physical quan-
tity goes through the interaction between the system and an instrument (supposed
macroscopic and obeying the laws of classical physics). Quantum Mechanics, in its
standard formulation, does not establish what a measuring instrument is; it only says
they exist. Nor is it capable of describing the interaction of instrument and quantum
system beyond the framework set in A3. Several viewpoints and conjectures exist on
how to complete the physical description of the measuring process. These are called,
in the slang of QM, collapse, or reduction, of the state or of the wavefunction. For
various reasons, though, none of the current proposals is entirely satisfactory [Des99,
Bon97, Ghi07, Alb94]. A very interesting proposal was put forward in 1985 by G.C.
Girardi, T. Rimini and A. Weber (Physical Review D34, 1985 p. 470), who described
in a dynamically nonlinear way the measuring process and assumed it is due to a
self-localisation process, rather than to an instrument. This idea, alas, still has sev-
eral weak points: in particular it does not allow – at least not in an obvious manner
– for a relativistic description.
(2) Axiom A3 refers to non-destructive testing, also known as indirect measurement
or measurement of the ﬁrst kind [BrKh95], where the physical system examined (typ-
ically a particle) is not absorbed/annihilated by the instrument. They are idealised
versions of the actual processes used in labs, and only in part can they be modelled
in such a way.
(3) Measuring instruments are commonly employed to prepare a system in a cer-
tain pure state. Theoretically-speaking the preparation of a pure state is carried out
like this: a ﬁnite collection of compatible propositions P1, . . . , Pn is chosen so that
the projection subspace of P1 ∧· · · ∧Pn = P1 · · · Pn is one-dimensional. In other
words P1 · · · Pn = (ψ| )ψ for some vector with ||ψ|| = 1. The existence of such
propositions is seen in practically all quantum systems used in experiments. (From a
theoretical point of view these are atomic propositions in the sense of Remark7.23(3),
and must exist because of the Hilbert space.) The propositions Pi are then simul-
taneously measured on several identical copies of the physical system of concern

(e.g., electrons), whose initial states, though, are unknown. If the measurements of
all propositions are successful for one system, the post-measurement state is deter-
mined by the vector ψ, and the system was prepared in that particular pure state.
Normally each projector Pi is associated to a measurable quantity Ai on the
system, and Pi deﬁnes the proposition “the quantity Ai belongs to the set Ei”. So in
practice, in order to prepare a system (available in arbitrarily many identical copies) in
the pure state ψ, one measures a number of compatible quantities Ai simultaneously,
and selects the systems for which the readings of the Ai belong to the given sets Ei.
(4) Let us explain how to obtain nonpure states from pure ones. Consider q1 identical
copies of system S prepared in the pure state associated to ψ1, q2 copies of S prepared
in a different pure state associated to ψ2 and so on, up to ψn. If we mix these states
each system will be in the necessarily nonpure state (see Exercise7.18):
ρ =
n

i=1
pi(ψi| )ψi ,
where pi := qi/ n
i=1 qi. In general, (ψi|ψ j) is not zero if i ̸= j, so the above
expressionforρ isnotthedecompositioninaneigenvectorbasisforρ.Thisprocedure
hints at the existence of two different types of probability: one intrinsic and due to
the quantum nature of state ψi; the other epistemic, and encoded in the probability
pi. But this is not true: once a nonpure state has been created, as above, there is
no way, within QM, to distinguish the states forming the mixture. For example, the
same ρ could have been obtained mixing other pure states than those determined by
the ψi. In particular, one could have used those in the eigenvector decomposition.
For physics, no kind of measurement (under the axioms of QM available thus far)
would distinguish the two mixtures.
(5) Axiom A3 permits us to give an interesting and natural interpretation to quantities
like ||P Qψ||2 = tr(ρψ P Q) where P, Q are incompatible propositions and ψ a
normalised vector representing a pure state. If P and Q were compatible ||P Qψ||2
would simply be the probability that P ∧Q is true in the pure state deﬁned by ψ.
This interpretation is now untenable. Taking the second case in A3 into account, we
can easily interpret the right-hand side of
||P Qψ||2 =


P Qψ
||Qψ||


2
||Qψ||2 .
It has the natural meaning of the probability of measuring ﬁrst Q true and next P true
in a consecutive measurement of Q and P. The asymmetry ||P Qψ||2 ̸= ||QPψ||2 is
in agreement with this interpretation. It is worth noticing that the same interpretation
can be given if P and Q are compatible. In that case, however, we will ﬁnd the same
result as by a simultaneous measurement of P and Q.
■
Axiom A3 can equivalently be stated using σ-additive probability measures on
L (HS) as, for dim HS ̸= 2, these are in one-to-one correspondence with the ele-

7.4 Propositions and States on Quantum Systems
345
ments of S(HS) by Gleason’s theorem. This equivalent formulation provides a nat-
ural interpretation of the axiom itself in terms of conditional probability:
A3 (measure-theory version). If μ : L (HS) →[0, 1] is the σ-additive probability
measurerepresentingthestateofthesystem,andproposition P ∈L (HS)istrueafter
a measurement at time t, the system’s state immediately afterwards is represented
by the σ-additive probability measure μP given by
μP(Q) := μ(P QP)
μ(P)
for every Q ∈L (HS) .
(7.31)
This formula is nothing but the translation of A3 in terms of associated measures. The
formulation of the post-measurement postulate in terms of measures, in principle, is
valid also for dim HS = 2.
The measure μP actually enjoys a natural conditional-probability property which
completelyﬁxesit,andthereforeitcanbeusedasajustiﬁcationofaxiomA3.Theidea
is that as soon as a proposition P has been proved to be true for a state (probability
measure) μ, another proposition Q ≤P must have probability μ(Q)/μ(P) to be
true in the post-measurement state μP. This constraint is completely natural when
the probability measures are deﬁned on Boolean lattices (σ-algebras), and is the basic
idea of conditional probability. In those Boolean cases, the requirement completely
ﬁxes the new probability measure μP over the whole lattice and not only over the
sublattice of the events P ≤Q. The reader can prove this easily, by observing that
a probability measure μP satisfying μP(Q) = μ(Q)/μ(P) for Q ≤P must have
support contained in P since μP(P) = μ(P)/μ(P) = 1. Actually, the result is true
even if L (HS) is not Boolean.
Proposition 7.40 Suppose dim(HS) ̸= 2 in axiom A3. The post-measurement prob-
ability measure μP (relative to the probability measure μ with value 1 on P ∈
L (HS)) is the unique probability measure on L (HS) such that
μP(Q) = μ(Q)
μ(P)
for every Q ∈L (HS) with Q ≤P .
Proof If Q ≤P then P QP = Q so that μP(Q) = μ(P QP)
μ(P)
= μ(Q)
μ(P). Conversely, let
ν be a σ-additive probability measure on the whole space L (HS) such that ν(Q) =
μ(Q)
μ(P) if Q ≤P, and indicate by Tν the trace-class operator associated with ν and by
TμP the one associated with μP. For Q = P we ﬁnd tr(Tν P) = μ(P)/μ(P) = 1 =
tr(TμP P). Now, Proposition7.38 implies Tν = PTν P and TμP = PTμP P. Hence
both Tν and TμP keep M = P(HS) invariant and vanish on M⊥. As a consequence it
is enough to prove that TμP↾M= Tν↾M to conclude that TμP = Tν, i.e., ν = μP. As a
matter of fact we already know that tr(Tν↾M Q) = ν(Q) = μP(Q) = tr(TμP↾M Q)

for Q ≤P. If we choose Q = (ψ|·)ψ with ψ ∈M of unit norm then the above
identity reads (ψ|(Tν↾M −TμP↾M)ψ) = 0, which implies Tν↾M −TμP↾M= 0, as we
wanted. □
7.4.5
Quantum Logics
The discussion in Sect.7.3.2 explains that it makes sense to describe propositions
about quantum system in terms of the (non-Boolean) projector lattice of a Hilbert
space, and incompatible propositions in terms of non-commuting projectors. More-
over, it makes sense to assign the usual meaning to ∧, ∨in terms of the connectives E ,
O, provided the former are employed with projectors describing compatible propo-
sitions.
In the general case R := P ∧Q denotes simply the projector onto the intersection
of the targets of P, Q. This R may be a meaningful statement about the system, but
as we noted earlier it does not correspond to the proposition P E Q when P, Q
relate to incompatible propositions. Conversely, the approach of Birkhoff and von
Neumann, that beﬁts the so-called Standard Quantum Logic, uses ∨and ∧as proper
connectives (yielding an algebra different from the usual one), even if they operate
between projectors of incompatible propositions (i.e. for which no instrument can
evaluate the truth of P, Q simultaneously). This is the reason why the point of
view of Quantum Logic has been criticised by physicists (cf. [Bon97, Chap.5] for
a thorough discussion). In the past years, alongside the modern development of
Birkhoff’s and von Neumann’s approach [EGL09], many authors have introduced
new formal strategies that differ from Quantum Logic à la Birkhoff–von Neumann,
in particular by means of topos theory [DoIs08, HLS09].
A difﬁcult issue is the operational meaning of P ∧Q and P ∨Q when P and
Q are incompatible. We know that P ∧Q and P ∨Q are orthogonal projectors
and correspond to some elementary proposition in their own right, which can be
experimentally tested by some procedure. However, just because P and Q cannot be
simultaneously tested, this procedure does not have an evident meaning in terms of
the outcome of the measurements of P and Q. Even if we will shall not enter into
the details of this ongoing debate (see also Sect.7.6.1), let us observe that as soon
as one assumes that elementary propositions are described by orthogonal projectors
on the Hilbert space HS, a proposition P ∈L (HS) is completely determined by
the class of states ρ ∈S(HS) for which P is always true: tr(ρP) = 1. This is an
immediate consequence of Proposition7.38. We therefore may identify a proposition
with the class of states for which the proposition is always true. This approach
permits us to partially grasp the operational meaning of P ∧Q even when P and
Q are incompatible. A state ρ makes P ∧Q always true (tr(ρP ∧Q) = 1) if and
only if the outcome of separate measurements of P, Q on that state (either on the
same system or on different copies, all prepared in the same state ρ) is always 1:
tr(ρP) = tr(ρQ) = 1. The proof of this fact is trivial: a measurement of P or Q
does not change the state ψ, in agreement with A3, because tr(ρP ∧Q) = 1 implies

7.4 Propositions and States on Quantum Systems
347
that each eigenvector in the decomposition of ρ belongs to the intersection of the
projection spaces of P and Q, by Proposition7.38. Irrespective of whether P and
Q are compatible, therefore, P ∧Q is the elementary proposition which is always
true on ρ if and only if P and Q are always true on ρ when measured separately
(independently from the order, when the measurements are performed on a single
system). This interpretation of the Boolean operation ‘meet’ can be taken to the level
of the abstract elementary propositions L [BeCa81, Sect.16.5], see Sect.7.6.1. A
similar proposal for P ∨Q would use the identity P ∨Q = ¬(¬P ∧¬Q), valid in
orthocomplemented lattices. But the ensuing interpretation is much more difﬁcult to
accept, for it involves a counterfactual conditional statement.
The observation above on the practical meaning of P ∧Q in case of incompatible
propositions also leads to a suggestive operational interpretation of P ∧Q due to
Jauch [Jau73], based on a result of von Neumann (Theorem13.7 in [Neu50]).
Theorem 7.41 (von Neumann’s theorem on iterated projectors) Let H be a complex
Hilbert space and P, Q : H →H orthogonal projectors, in general not commuting.
Calling, as usual, P ∧Q the orthogonal projector onto P(H) ∩Q(H), we have:
(P ∧Q)x =
lim
n→+∞(P Q)nx
for any x ∈H.
(7.32)
Proof First, Q(P Q)n = (QP Q)n = (QP)n Q. The sequence An = (QP Q)n ∈
B(H) satisﬁes An ≥An+1 ≥0: ||√QP Q||2 = ||QP Q|| ≤||Q||2||P|| ≤1 and 0 ≤
(x|An+1x) = ||√QP Q(QP Q)n/2x||2 ≤||√QP Q||2||(QP Q)n/2x||2 = ||√QP Q||2
(x|Anx). By Proposition3.76, s- limn→+∞(QP Q)n = R ∈B(H). Immediately,
RR = R and (Rx|y) = limn(x|(Q(P Q)n)∗y) = limn(x|(QP)n Qy) = (x|Ry), so
R = R∗. By construction P R = s- limn P Q(P Q)n = R. Therefore (P Q)n →R ∈
L (H) in the strong topology. Analogously (QP)n →R′ ∈L (H) in the same topol-
ogy. However, (x|(P Q)ny) →(x|Ry) is equivalent to ((QP)nx|y) →(x|Ry), i.e.
(R′x|y) = (x|Ry). Since R′ = R′∗we have R′ = R. Clearly RP = R = RQ, so
R(H) ⊃P(H) ∩Q(H). The orthogonal to the latter space is generated (by De Mor-
gan’s laws) by (¬P)(H) and (¬Q)(H). As R(¬P) = R(¬Q) = 0, we conclude
R(H) = P(H) ∩Q(H). □
There is an interesting physical point of view that interprets the right-hand side of
(7.32) as the consecutive and alternated measurement of an inﬁnite sequence of
propositions P, Q. From this perspective the proposition P ∧Q is always true for a
pure state represented by the unit vector ψ of a quantum system (||P ∧Qψ||2 = 1)
only if all propositions in the sequence turn out to be true (see (5) in Remark7.39)
when performed on the system in the initial pure state ψ.7
The extension to mixed states is easy.
7If ||P ∧Qψ||2 = 1, the state does not change after each single measurement of P or Q, in
accordance with A3, because of Proposition7.38, as already observed for a general ρ.

Observables as Projector-Valued Measures on R
At this point we want to introduce observables by means of projector-valued mea-
sures (PVM). This notion lies at the heart of the mathematical formulation of standard
QM. In ensuing chapters this notion will be generalised and made more precise, but
it will be only in the spectral decomposition of unbounded self-adjoint operators that
PVMs will reveal their full potential.
7.5.1
Axiom A4: The Notion of Observable
In Quantum Mechanics, a physical quantity that is testable on a physical system and
whose behaviour is described by QM1 and QM2 is called an observable.
As seen in Sect.7.2.4, it is reasonable to label measurement readings by Borel
subsets of R. From the physical point of view it is natural to assume that if the orthog-
onal projectors P(A)
E
associated to the observable A commute with each other then
E ∈B(R) (the Borel σ-algebra of R), since we expect, for E ∈B(R), propositions
like
P(A)
E
:=
“The value of A on the state of the system belongs to the Borel set E ⊂R”
to be all compatible. If it were not so, we would not have an observable, but distinct
incompatible quantities. Since the outcome belongs to both E and E′ if and only if it
belongs to E ∩E′, we take P(A)
E
∧P(A)
E′
= P(A)
E∩E′. Assume also P(A)
R
= I, because
the result certainly belongs to R, so P(A)
R
is a tautology, independent of the state on
which the measurement is done. Eventually, for physically self-evident reasons and
because of the logical meaning of ∨, it is reasonable to suppose
∨n∈NP(A)
En = P(A)
∪n∈NEn
for any ﬁnite or countable collection {En}n∈N of Borel sets of R. Although one could
also take sets of arbitrary cardinality, we will stop at countable, as we did in the
classical case.
Deﬁnition 7.42 If H is a Hilbert space, a function A mapping E ∈B(R) to an
orthogonal projector P(A)
E
∈L (H) is called an observable if:
(a) P(A)
E
P(A)
E′

(c) P(A)

∨n∈NP(A)
En = P(A)
∪n∈NEn .

7.5 Observables as Projector-Valued Measures on R
349
Remark 7.43 (1) It is straightforwardtoseethat {P(A)
E }E∈B(R) is a Booleanσ-algebra
for the usual partial order relation ≤of projectors. In general {P(A)
E }E∈B(R) is not
maximal commutative.
(2) Bearing in mind Deﬁnition7.13 it is easy to prove that an observable is nothing but
a homomorphism of Boolean σ-algebras, mapping the Borel σ-algebra B(R) to the
Boolean σ-algebra of projectors {P(A)
E }E⊂B(R). It can be proved ([Jau73, Chaps.5–
6]) that if H is a separable Hilbert space, any subset of projectors in L (H) forming
a Boolean σ-algebra is automatically an observable, i.e. of the form {P(A)
E }E∈B(R),
and satisﬁes Deﬁnition7.42.
■
Observables may be redeﬁned in an equivalent way, but mathematically simpler, as
the next proposition shows.
Proposition 7.44 Let H be a Hilbert space. A map P : B(R) →B(H) is an observ-
able if and only if the following hold.
(a) P(B) ≥0 for any B ∈B(R);
(b) P(B)P(B′) = P(B ∩B′) for any B, B′ ∈B(R);
(c) P(R) = I;
(d) for any family {Bn}n∈N ⊂B(R) with Bn ∩Bm = ∅if n ̸= m:
s-
+∞

n=0
P(Bn) = P(∪n∈NBn) .
Proof If P : B(R) →B(H) is an observable properties (a), (b), (c), (d) are trivially
true. So we have to prove that any P : B(R) →B(H) satisfying them is an observ-
able.
Let us collect all operators P(B) with B ∈B(R) in one maximal set of commuting
projectors L0(H) (which exists by Zorn’s lemma), and from now on we shall work
in it without loss of generality.
(a) says that every operator P(B) is self-adjoint by Proposition3.60(f), so (b) implies
P(B)P(B) = P(B ∩B) = P(B), whence every P(B) is an orthogonal projector.
Moreover (b) implies, if P(B)P(B′) = P(B ∩B′) = P(B′ ∩B) = P(B′)P(B),
that all projectors commute with one another. Using the ﬁrst identity in (i) of
Theorem7.22(b), condition (b) above reads P(B) ∧P(B′) = P(B ∩B′). To ﬁn-
ish we need to show property (d) of Deﬁnition7.42. Consider countably many sets
{En}n∈N ⊂B(R), in general not disjoint. We want to ﬁnd ∨n∈NP(En) and prove that
∨n∈NP(En) = P(∪n∈NEn) .
To do so deﬁne a collection {Bn}n∈N of pairwise disjoint Borel sets: B0 := E0 and
Bn = En \ (E1 ∪· · · ∪En−1)

rem7.22(b) recursively, we ﬁnd
∨p
n=0P(En) = ∨p
n=0P(Bn) for any n ∈N.
As part (d) of the present proposition implies

for ﬁnitely many disjoint Bn (this collection may be made countable by adding
inﬁnitely many empty sets), we have

P(Bn) .
(7.33)
To conclude we take the strong limit as p →+∞in (7.33). This exists by Theo-

∨n∈NP(En) = s- lim
p→+∞

P(Bn) = P(∪n∈NBn) = P(∪n∈NEn) .
□
Remark 7.45 (1) Notice that (c) and (d) alone imply I = P(I ∪∅) = I + P(∅),
so
P(∅) = 0 .
(2) If B ∈B(R) then R \ B ∈B(R) and R = B ∪(R \ B). By (d), taking B0 = B,
B1 = R \ B and all remaining Bk = ∅, we obtain I = P(B) + P(R \ B). Therefore
¬P(B) = P(R \ B) .
■
The above proposition sets up a 1-1 correspondence between observables and well-
known objects in mathematics, namely projector-valued measures on R. The latter
will be generalised in the next chapter.

7.5 Observables as Projector-Valued Measures on R
351
Deﬁnition 7.46 A map P : B(R) →B(H), H a Hilbert space, satisfying (a), (b),
(c) and (d) in Proposition7.44 is called a projector-valued measure (PVM) on R
or spectral measure on R.
We are ﬁnally in the position to disclose the fourth axiom of the general mathematical
formulation of Quantum Mechanics.
A4. Every observable A on a quantum system S is described by a projector-valued
measure P(A) on R in the Hilbert space HS of the system. If E is a Borel set in R, the
projector P(A)(E) corresponds to the proposition “the reading of a measurement of
A falls in the Borel set E”.
Remark 7.47 (1) Let us suppose, owing to a superselection rule (see Sect.7.7), that
the Hilbert space splits into coherent sectors HS = ⊕k∈KHSk. Call Pk the orthogonal
projector onto HSk. From Sect.7.7.1, every projector P(A)
E
of an observable A satis-
ﬁes Pk P(A)
E
= P(A)
E
Pk for any k ∈K and any Borel set E ⊂R.
(2) We say that the observable B is a function of the observable A, written
B = f (A), when there is a measurable map f : R →R such that P(B)(E) =
P(A)( f −1(E)) for any Borel set E ⊂R. This is totally natural: if “B = f (A)” then
to measure B we can measure A and use f on the reading. In this sense the outcome
of measuring B belongs to E iff the outcome of A belongs in f −1(E). In particular,
the elementary propositions (orthogonal projectors) P(B)
E
and P(A)
F
are always com-
patible, and {P(B)
E }E∈B(R) ⊂{P(A)
F }F∈B(R). It is possible to prove [Jau73] that for
given observables A, B in a separable Hilbert space, the previous inclusion is equiv-
alent to the existence of a measurable map f such that B = f (A). More important is
a result of von Neumann and Varadarajan [Jau73, Chaps.6–7] (valid for any ortho-
complemented, σ-complete, separable lattice, not necessarily the projector lattice of
a Hilbert space):
Theorem 7.48 If {A j} j∈J is a family of pairwise-compatible observables (that is,
P( j)(E)P(i)(F) = P(i)(F)P( j)(E) if P( j)(E) ∈A j, P(i)(F) ∈Ai) on a separable
Hilbert space, there exists an observable A and a corresponding family of measurable
maps f j : R →R, j ∈J such that A j = f j(A) for any j ∈J.

Self-adjoint Operators Associated to Observables:
Physical Motivation and Basic Examples
This section contains the idea underpinning the correspondence between self-adjoint
operators and observables. We will, in other words, provide the physical motivation
for the spectral theorems of Chaps.8 and 9.
For classical systems, at time t on phase space F, we know that observables
correspond to what have been called physical quantities, i.e. measurable maps

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
f : F →R. To any physical quantity f we can associate the collection of all propo-
sitions/Borel sets of the form:
P( f )
E
:=
“The value of f on the system’s state belongs to the Borel set E ⊂R”,
or, set-theoretically,
P( f )
E
:= f −1(E) ∈B(F) .
Propositions7.18 and 7.19 told us that {P( f )
E }E∈B(R) is a (Boolean) σ-algebra and the
map B(R) ∋E →P( f )
E
∈B(F) a Boolean σ-algebra homomorphism. The picture
is the same in the quantum case when we look at the class {P(A)
E }E∈B(R) of proposi-
tions/projectors associated to an observable A: they form a Boolean σ-algebra and
B(R) ∋E →P(A)
E
∈L (H) is a homomorphism of Boolean σ-algebras. If we com-
pare {P( f )
E }E∈B(R) and {P(A)
E }E∈B(R) the situation is analogous. In the classical case,
though, there exists a function f consenting to build the collection {P( f )
E }E∈B(R):
this map retains, alone, all possible information about the propositions P( f )
E . This is
no surprise since we deﬁned propositions/sets starting from f ! In the quantum case,
when an observable {P(A)
E }E∈B(R) is given, we have nothing, at least at present, that
may correspond to a function f “generating” the PVM {P(A)
E }E∈B(R). So is there a
quantum analogue to f ?
In order to answer the question we must dig deeper into the relationship between
f and the associated family {P( f )
E }E∈B(R). We know how to get the latter out of the
former, but now we are interested in recovering the map from the family, because in
the quantum formulation one starts from the analogue of {P( f )
E }E∈B(R). As a matter
of fact the σ-algebra {P( f )
E }E∈B(R) allows to reconstruct f by means of a certain
limiting process reminiscent of integration.
To explain this point we need a technical result. Recall that if (X, Σ) is a measure
space, a Σ-measurable map s : X →C is simple if its range is ﬁnite.
Proposition 7.49 Let (X, Σ) be a measure space, S(X) the space of complex-valued
simple functions with respect to Σ, M(X) the space of C-valued, Σ-measurable
maps, and Mb(X) ⊂M(X) the subspace of bounded maps. Then
(a) S(X) is dense in M(X) pointwise.
(b) S(X) is dense in Mb(X) in norm || ||∞.
(c) If f ∈M(X) ranges over non-negative reals, there is a sequence {sn}n∈N ⊂S(X)
with:
0 ≤s0 ≤s1 ≤· · · ≤sn(x) →f (x) as n →+∞, for any x ∈X.
Furthermore, the convergence is in norm || ||∞as well, provided f ∈Mb(X).
Proof It is enough to prove the claim for real-valued maps, for the complex case
is a consequence of decomposing complex functions into real and imaginary parts.
Deﬁne f+(x) := sup{0, f (x)} and f−(x) := inf{0, f (x)}, x ∈X; then f = f+ +

f−, where f+ ≥0, f−≤0 are known to be measurable since f is. Now we construct
a sequence of simple maps converging to f+ (whence part (c) is proven, as f = f+
if f ≥0). For given 0 < n ∈N let us partition the real semi-axis [0, +∞) into Borel

f+ pointwise if n →+∞. The estimate | f+(x) −sn(x)| ≤1/2n is uniform in x
if f+ is bounded (take n > sup f+), and then sn →f+ uniformly, too. Similarly,
by partitioning the negative semi-axis we may construct another simple sequence
{s(−)
n
≤0} tending to f−pointwise. Overall, the simple sequence s(−)
n
+ sn converges
to f pointwise, and uniformly if f is additionally bounded. □
Remark 7.50 If f is non-negative, part (a) still holds even when f : X →[0, +∞],
by taking simple maps that attain the value +∞.

It is clear thus that a given classical quantity f : F →R (measurable) can be recov-
eredusingasequenceofmapsthatareconstantnon-zeroonlyonsetsin{P( f )
E }E∈B(R).
Without loss of generality we focus on the situation f : F →R+ and further sup-
pose f bounded. This entitles us to forget, in (7.34) and for n large enough: (i)
all intervals En and (ii) the En,i with left endpoint ((i −1)2−n) larger, say, than
(sup f ) + 1/2n, for the pre-image of these sets under f is empty. If we do so the
sum in (7.34) can be truncated:
f =

(7.35)
This limit may be understood as an integration of sorts with respect to a “measure
with values on characteristic functions”:
ν( f ) : B(R) ∋E →χ f −1(E) ∈S(X),
associating to a Borel subset E ⊂R (in the range of the map) a characteristic function
χ f −1(E) : X →C. Observe, in fact, that i−1

P( f )
n,i – the estimate becomes more accurate as n increases – and the right-hand side
in (7.35) is just a “Cauchy sum”. Equation (7.35) might be formally written as:
f =

R
λdν( f )(λ) .
(7.36)
But as we are concerned with the quantum setting, we will not push the analogy
further, even though doing that would give a rigorous meaning to the above integral.
In such case the similar formula to (7.36) is:
A =

R
λd P(A)(λ)
where the characteristic functions χ f −1(E) have been replaced by the orthogonal
projectors P(A)
E
of the observable A. This relation deﬁnes a self-adjoint operator A
associated to an observable, that was called A and that corresponds to the classical
quantity f . From such an operator the observable {P(A)
E }E∈B(R) can be recovered, a
posteriori, in a similar manner to what we do to get {P( f )
E }E∈B(R) out of f . We will
see all this in full generality, and rigorously, in the sequel (Chaps.8 and 9). At this
juncture we shall describe an elementary example of observable and show how to
associate to it a self-adjoint operator.
Examples 7.51 (1) Consider a quantum system described on a Hilbert space H, and
take a quantity ranging, from the point of view of physics, over a discrete and ﬁnite
set of distinct values {an}n=1,··· ,N ⊂R. We ﬁrst show how to ﬁnd an observable A
given by a family of orthogonal projectors P(A)
E , E ∈B(R). We posit that there are
non-null orthogonal projectors labelled by an, {Pan}n=1,··· ,N, such that Pan Pam = 0 if
n ̸= m (i.e., taking adjoints, Pam Pan = 0 if n ̸= m), and moreover:
N

n=1
Pan = I .
(7.37)
The meaning of Pan, clearly, is:
“the value of A, read by a measurement on the system, is precisely an”.
Obviously the equations Pan Pam = Pam Pan = 0, i.e. Pan ∧Pam = 0 for n ̸= m corre-
spond to two physical requirements: (a) the propositions Pan, Pam are physically com-
patible, but (b) the observable’s measurement cannot produce distinct values an and
am simultaneously (the proposition associated to the null projector is contradictory).
Demanding N
n=1 Pan = I, i.e. Pa1 ∨· · · ∨Pan = I, amounts to asking that at least
one proposition Pan is true when measuring A. The observable A : B(R) →L (H)
is built as follows: for any Borel set E ⊂R

P(A)
E
:=

an∈E
Pan ,
with P(A)
∅
:= 0 .
(7.38)
Properties (a), (b), (c) and (d) in Proposition7.44 are immediate.
(2) Referring to example (1), to the observable A we can associate an operator still
called A:
A :=
N

n=0
an Pan .
(7.39)
This A is bounded and self-adjoint by construction, being a real linear combination
of self-adjoint operators. It has another interesting property: the eigenvalue set σp(A)
of A coincides with the values the observable A can assume.
The proof is direct: if 0 ̸= u ∈Pan(H) then Pamu = Pam Panu = u if n = m or 0 if
n ̸= m. Inserting this in (7.39) gives Au = anu, so an ∈σp(A). Conversely, if u ̸= 0
is a λ-eigenvector of A (λ real since A = A∗), then (7.39) implies
λu =
N

n=0
an Panu .
On the other hand, since 
an Pan = I we obtain
N

n=0
λPanu =
N

n=0
an Panu ,
hence
N

n=0
(λ −an)Panu = 0 .
(7.40)
Now apply Pm and recall Pm Pn = δm,n Pn, resulting in N identities:
(λ −am)Pamu = 0 .
If all of them were solved by Pmu = 0 for any m, we would obtain a contradiction,
because
0 ̸= u = Iu =
N

n=0
Panu .
Therefore there must be some n in (7.40) for which λ = an. This can happen for one
value n only, since by assumption the an are distinct. Overall the eigenvalue λ of A
must be one particular an. So we proved that the eigenvalue set of A coincides with
the values A can assume. The self-adjoint operator A here plays a role similar to that
of f for the classical quantity {P( f )
E }E∈T (R).

(3) Suppose A is the operator of an observable in the sense of (7.39), and g : R →R
is a map. We can deﬁne a new observable, as if it were a function of the previous
one, determined entirely by the self-adjoint operator
C := g(A) :=
N

n=0
g(an)Pan .
(7.41)
By construction the possible values of the new observable are the images g(an), that
in turn determine the eigenvalues of C.
■
In the next chapters we will develop a procedure for associating to each observable
A (i.e. a PVM on R) a unique self-adjoint operator (typically unbounded) denoted
by the same letter A, thereby generalising the previous examples. The values the
observable can take will be elements in the spectrum σ(A), which is normally larger
than the set σp(A) of eigenvalues. The major tool will be the integration with respect
to a projector-valued measure, corresponding to a generalisation of

λ∈σp(A)
h(λ)Pλ =:

σ(A)
h(λ) d P(A)(λ)
to the case when the λ can be inﬁnite. In particular
A =

σ(A)
λ d P(A)(λ) ,
I =

σ(A)
1 d P(A)(λ),
whose interpretation beﬁts the theory of spectral measures.
7.5.3
Probability Measures Associated to Couples
State/Observable
Here is yet another remarkable property about PVMs on R, with important conse-
quences in physics.
Proposition 7.52 Let H be a Hilbert space and A = {PE}E∈B(R) a projector-valued
measure on R. If ρ ∈S(H) is a state, the map μ(A)
ρ
: E →tr(ρPE) is a Borel
probability measure on R.
Proof The proof is elementary. It sufﬁces to show μ(A)
ρ
is positive, σ-additive and
μ(A)
ρ (R) = 1. As R is Hausdorff and locally compact, every positive σ-additive mea-
sure on the Borel algebra is a Borel measure. Decompose ρ in the usual way with an
eigenvector basis:
ρ =

j∈N
p j(ψ j| )ψ j ,

7.5 Observables as Projector-Valued Measures on R
357
where the p j are non-negative and their sum is 1. Then μ(A)
ρ (E) = tr(ρPE) ≥0
because orthogonal projectors are positive, Pj ≥0 and tr(ρPE) = 
j∈N p j(ψ j|
PEψ j). Moreover μ(A)
ρ (R) = 1, since PR = I implies

j∈N
p j(ψ j|Iψ j) = trρ = 1 .
Let us show σ-additivity. If {En}n∈N are pairwise-disjoint Borel sets and E :=
∪n∈NEn, by Proposition7.44(d):

Since p j ≥0 and (ψ j|PEiψ j) ≥0, Fubini’s theorem allows to swap the series:
tr(ρPE) =
+∞

i=0
+∞

j=0
p j(ψ j|PEiψ j) =


i=0
tr(ρPEi) .
That is to say, if {En}n∈N are pairwise-disjoint Borel sets then
μ(A)
ρ (∪n∈NEn) =
+∞

n=0
μ(A)
ρ (En) ,
ending the proof.
□
Examples 7.53 (1) The observable A of (1) and (2) in Example7.51 assumes a ﬁnite
number N of discrete values an. Let A (cf. 7.39) also denote the self-adjoint operator
of the observable. Fix a state ρ ∈S(H) and consider its probability measure relative
to the observable {P(A)
E }E∈B(R). By construction, if E ∈B(R):
μ(A)
ρ (E) := tr(ρP(A)
E ) =

an∈E
tr(ρPan) =

an
pnδan(E)
with
pn := tr(ρPan) .
Hence
μ(A)
ρ

an
pnδan ,
(7.42)
where δan are Dirac measures centred at an: δa(E) = 1 if a ∈E, δa(E) = 0 if a /∈E.
Note 0 ≤pn ≤1 and 
n pn = 1 by construction. Thus the probability measure
associated to the state ρ and relative to A is a convex combination of Dirac measures.

(2) The mean value ⟨A⟩ρ, of A and its standard deviation ΔA2

In case ρ is pure, i.e. ρ = ψ(ψ|·), ||ψ|| = 1, (7.43) implies
⟨A⟩ψ = (ψ|Aψ) ,

where ⟨A⟩ψ indicates the mean value of A on the state of the vector ψ. By deﬁnition
the deviation equals

The formulas above are actually valid, under suitable technical assumptions, in a
broader context. This will be proved in Proposition11.27, after we show in full
generality the procedure for associating self-adjoint operators to observables.

More Advanced, Foundational and Technical Issues
In this section we shall mainly focus on a number of foundational issues concerning
the nature of the quantum lattice of elementary propositions and on historically
related technical result, such as the direct decomposition into von Neumann algebra
of deﬁnite type. The last subsection will characterise the space of states S(H) and
will have a purely mathematical ﬂavour.
Foundational studies on the role of the projector lattice, in relationship to the
logical formulation of QM, are found in [Mac63, Jau73, Pir76, BeCa81, Red98,
DCGi02, Var07, EGL09] besides [Bon97]. The reader can read about a different
approach in [Emc72]: this book is based on Jordan algebras and prepares for the
algebraic formulation following ideas of Segal.
7.6.1
Recovering the Hilbert Space from the Lattice: The
Theorems of Piron and Solèr
A reasonable question to ask is whether there are more cogent reasons for choosing
to describe quantum systems via a projector lattice, other than the kill-all argument
“it works”. To tackle the problem we shall need certain special properties of the
lattice of projectors. We start with some abstract deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 7.54 In a lattice (X, ≥), we say that a ∈X covers b ∈X if a ≥b, a ̸= b,
and a ≥c ≥b implies either c = a or c = b.
In a bounded lattice (X, ≥), an element a ∈X \ {0} is called an atom if 0 ≤r ≤
a ⇒r = 0 or r = a.
An orthocomplemented lattice (X, ≥) is said:
(a) separable if any collection {r j} j∈A ⊂X of orthogonal elements, ri ⊥r j, i ̸= j,
is countable at most;
(b) atomic if for any r ∈X \ {0} there exists an atom a ≤r;
(b)’ atomistic if it is atomic and every r ∈X \ {0} is the join of the atoms a ≤r;
(c) to satisfy the covering property if, for any p ∈X and any atom a, then a ∧p =
0 ⇒a ∨p covers p;
(d) irreducible if the centre of X only contains 0 and 1.
Remark 7.55 It is easy to prove two atoms a, b in an orthocomplemented lattice
commute if and only if either a ⊥b or a = b.
■
The following result holds for the projection lattice L (H).

360
7
The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
Theorem 7.56 The orthocomplemented, complete lattice L (H) of Theorem7.22 is
(i) separable ⇔H is separable,
(ii) atomic and atomistic,
(iii) orthomodular;
(iv) it satisﬁes the covering property, and is
(v) irreducible.
The atoms in L (H) are the orthogonal projectors onto one-dimensional subspaces.
Proof (i) If H is separable, every set of orthogonal projectors {Pj} j∈J with Pj ⊥Ph,
i.e. Pj Ph = 0, if h ̸= j must be ﬁnite or countable. Having an uncountable set of
pairwise-orthogonal vectors (one could choose one in each Pj(H)) is forbidden by
Theorem3.30, for maximal sets of orthonormal vectors in a separable Hilbert space
are ﬁnite or countable. If L (H) is separable, the set N of orthogonal projectors Pu
associated to the elements of a Hilbert basis U ∋u of H satisfy Pu ⊥Pv if u ̸= v,
and so N must be ﬁnite or countable. Then H is separable by Theorem3.30.
(ii) It is easy to prove that the atoms are the orthogonal projectors onto one-
dimensional subspaces just by applying the deﬁnition. Hence L (H) is atomic. Let
us prove that it is atomistic. If P ∈L (H) projects onto M and U is a (Hilbert) basis
of M, evidently supu∈U Pu = P, where Pu is the orthogonal projector onto the space
generated by u. If AM is the set of atoms Q ≤P, then supQ∈AM Q ≥supu∈U Pu, just
because Pu ∈AM. On the other hand, (a) in Theorem7.22(i) implies that supQ∈AM Q
projects onto < {Q(H)}Q∈AM >, which is contained in M because closure of ﬁnite
combinations of elements in M, and M is closed. Hence supQ∈AM Q ≤supu∈U Pu.
Summing up, supQ∈AM Q = supu∈U Pu = P, which means L (H) is atomistic.
(iii) We must prove that P ≤Q ⇒Q = P ∨((I −P) ∧Q) for any orthogonal pro-
jectors P, Q. To this end, by Proposition7.20 P ≤Q ⇒P Q = QP = P. There-
fore, again by Proposition7.20 the identity to prove is Q = P + (I −P)Q −P(I −
P)Q. But that is trivial, by direct inspection.
(iv) If A, P ∈B(H) and A is an atom, asking A ∧P = 0 is equivalent to say-
ing that A(H) is a one-dimensional subspace not contained in the closed subspace
M := P(H). Hence A ∨P projects onto a subspace of dimension one more than
P(H). We can write A ∨P(H) = M ⊕< n > for some unit vector n ⊥M. The cov-
ering property is then equivalent to the obvious fact that if 0 ̸= n ⊥M, there are no
closed subspaces N with M ⊊N ⊊M ⊕< n >.
(v) Irreducibility can be proved using the same proof of Proposition3.93(a): A ∈
B(H)′ can be replaced by A ∈L (H)′ to give the same ﬁnal result, namely that
A = cI for some c ∈C. Since at present A ∈L (H), so that A = A∗and AA = A,
we must have either A = 0 or A = I. In other words, the centre of L (H) is {0, I}
and L (H) is irreducible. □

Remark 7.57 (1) Atomicity and atomisticity necessarily coalesce under orthomodu-
larity:
Proposition 7.58 An orthomodular lattice is atomic if and only if it is atomistic.
Proof See Exercise7.6 □
(2) An orthocomplemented, atomistic lattice with the covering property is sometimes
called an AC lattice. In an atomic orthomodular lattice X, the covering property is
equivalent to each of the following statements [BeCa81].
(i) For every a ∈X and for every pair of atoms p, q ∈X with p ≰a and q ≰a, the
relation p ≤a ∨q implies q ≤a ∨p.
(ii) For every a ∈X and every atom p ∈X with p ≰a⊥, the element (called Sasaki
projection of p onto a) a ∧(p ∨a⊥) is an atom.
■
All the properties of Theorem7.56 admit an operational interpretation (e.g. see
[BeCa81]). Based on the experimental evidence of quantum systems, therefore, we
might try to prove, in absence of an Hilbert space, that the elementary propositions
about a quantum system with experimental outcome in {0, 1} form a poset. For that
we would ﬁrst need a bounded, orthocomplemented, complete lattice that veriﬁes
conditions (i)–(v) above. Then we should prove that this lattice is described by the
orthogonal projectors of a Hilbert space. The second step is an entire, and challeng-
ing, programme, known as the coordinatisation problem [BeCa81]: it was initiated
by several researchers in the 1960s and completed by M.P. Solèr in 1995, as we shall
see below.
Although the partial order of elementary propositions can be deﬁned in various
ways, it will always correspond to the logical implication, in some way or another.
Starting from [Mac63] a number of approaches (either of physical nature, essentially,
or formal) have been developed toward this end: among them are those making use
of the notion of (quantum) state. The objects are now [Mac63] pairs (O, S ), where
O is the class of observables and S are the states. Elementary propositions form
a subclass L of O equipped with a natural poset structure (L , ≤) (and satisfying
weakened versions of conditions (i)–(v)). A state s ∈S , in particular, deﬁnes the
probability ms(P) that P is true for every P ∈L [Mac63]. As a matter of fact,
if P, Q ∈L , P ≤Q is deﬁned to mean ms(P) ≤ms(Q) for every state s ∈S .
A different, and apparently weaker, interpretation due to Jauch appears in [Jau68]:
there P ≤Q means that if P is true in a state s, also Q is true in s. More difﬁcult
is to justify that the poset thus obtained is a lattice, i.e. that it admits greatest lower
bound P ∨Q and least upper bound P ∧Q for any P, Q. Nowadays there exist
several proposals, very different in character, to justify the lattice structure. See
Aerts in [EGL09] for a recent operational viewpoint, and [BeCa81, Sect.21.1] for a
summary on several possible ways to introduce the lattice structure on the poset of
abstract elementary propositions L . If we accept the lattice structure on elementary
propositions of a quantum system, then we may deﬁne orthocomplementation by
the familiar logical/physical negation. Compatible propositions can then be deﬁned
in terms of commuting propositions as of Deﬁnition7.8 (by (v) in Theorem7.22(a)
this notion of compatibility is the usual one when propositions are interpreted via

362
7
The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
projectors). Now fully-ﬂedged with an orthocomplemented lattice of elementary
propositions and the notion of compatible propositions, we can attach a physical
meaning (an interpretation backed by experimental evidence) to the requests that
the lattice be orthocomplemented, complete, atomic, irreducible, and to the covering
property [BeCa81]. Under these hypotheses, and supposing there exist at least 4
pairwise-orthogonal atoms, Piron ([Pir64, JaPi69, Pir76], [BeCa81, Chap.21], Aerts
in [EGL09]) used projective geometry techniques to show that the lattice of quantum
propositions can be identiﬁed canonically with a certain class of subspaces in a
generalised vector space of sorts. We shall merge Piron’s theorem with a result by
Maeda–Maeda [MaMa70] (part (b) below). There are other versions of this result
where the lattice is atomic, rather than atomistic (this is only apparently weaker, for
the lattice is orthomodular).
Theorem 7.59 (Piron–Maeda–Maeda) Let L be an orthocomplemented, complete,
irreducible and atomistic lattice satisfying the covering property. Suppose L con-
tains at least 4 pairwise orthogonal atoms.8 Then, there exist
(i) a (generally noncommutative) division ring B with unit 1 and zero 0,
(ii) an involutive anti-automorphism (i.e., a map B ∋λ →λ ∈B such that
μ + ν = μ + ν, μν = ν μ, and μ = μ),
(iii) a ‘generalised’ vector space E over B,
(iv) a Hermitian form ⟨·|·⟩: E × E →B (i.e. linear in the second slot and
conjugate-symmetric) which is non-singular (⟨x|x⟩= 0 implies x = 0),
satisfying the following properties.
(a) L is isomorphic to the orthocomplemented lattice of subspaces M ⊂E sat-
isfying (M⊥)⊥= M (⊥in reference to the Hermitian product), ordered by inclusion.
(b) L is orthomodular if and only if M + M⊥= E for any M ⊂E with M =
(M⊥)⊥.
And this is not the whole story. Many people conjecture (see [BeCa81]) that if the lat-
tice is also orthomodular, the division ring B becomes a real division algebra and can
only be picked among R, C or H (quaternion algebra). More recently Solèr [Sol95],
Holland [Hol95] and Aerts-van Steirteghem have found sufﬁcient hypotheses for this
to happen. We state below, in a joint proposition, the results of Solèr and Holland.
The notation is the same as in Theorem7.59.
Theorem 7.60 (Solèr–Holland) Consider a lattice L that is orthocomplemented,
complete, irreducible and atomistic, satisﬁes the covering property and contains at
least four pairwise-orthogonal atoms. Assume L is orthomodular. Suppose that one
of the following (equivalent) conditions holds:
(a)(Solèr)Econtainsaninﬁniteorthonormalsequence{en}n∈N ⊂E,i.e.⟨en|en⟩=
1 for every n ∈N (1 is the unit of the division ring B).
(b) (Holland) E contains an inﬁnite orthogonal sequence {en}n∈N ⊂E with
⟨en|en⟩= a for every n ∈N and some ﬁxed a ∈B \ {0}.
8With our hypotheses, this is equivalent to supposing L contains 4 distinct elements 0 ̸= p1 <
p2 < p3 < p4, as in other formulations of this result.

7.6 More Advanced, Foundational and Technical Issues
363
(c) (Holland) E does not have ﬁnite (algebraic) dimension and, for every orthog-
onal atoms p, q ∈L there exists a linear bijective map U : E →E such that
⟨x|y⟩= ⟨Ux|Uy⟩for all x, y ∈E and U(p) = q.
Then the following hold:
(i) B is either R, C or H with the respective conjugation as anti-automorphism,9
(ii) either ⟨·|·⟩or −⟨·|·⟩is positive,
(iii) E is complete for the norm induced by ⟨·|·⟩, hence a real or complex Hilbert
space or a generalised structure (e.g., see [GMP13]) if B = H.
The Hilbert space E is separable if and only if L is separable.
Irreducibility is not really essential. If we remove it the lattice can be split into
irreducible sublattices [Jau73, BeCa81] and the argument goes through on each
summand. Physically speaking this situation is natural in presence of superselection
rules, of which more soon.
It is worth stressing that the covering property, on the contrary, is a crucial hypoth-
esis for Theorem7.60. Indeed there are other relevant lattices in physics that verify
all remaining properties. Remarkably, the family of so-called causally closed sub-
sets in some physically meaningful spacetime satisﬁes all properties but the covering
law [Cas02, CFJ17]. This obstruction prevents one to endow a spacetime with the
structure of a (generalised) Hilbert space. Having said that, it might suggest a way
towards a formulation of quantum gravity.
Recently, M. Oppio and the author of this book [MoOp17, MoOp18] have
explained why one can rule out real and quaternionic Hilbert spaces as possible tools
to describe elementary physical systems acted upon by the Poincaré group (elemen-
tary particles), when some hypotheses in the Solèr–Piron theorem are relaxed (such
as the covering property).
7.6.2
The Projector Lattice of von Neumann Algebras and the
Classiﬁcation of von Neumann Algebras and Factors
A historically important point for developing von Neumann’s theory was that the
lattice of elementary propositions on a quantum system should satisfy the modularity
condition (Deﬁnition7.8(d)). We will not go into explaining the manifold reasons
for this (see Rédei in [EGL09]). It will be enough to remark, as von Neumann
himself proved, that L (H) is not modular if H does not have ﬁnite dimension.
The way out proposed by von Neumann and Murray is to reduce the number of
elementary observables on the quantum system, so to guarantee modularity also in
the inﬁnite-dimensional case. The ensuing theoretical results have become of the
utmost importance in quantum theories, independently from the initial problem of
von Neumann, so we shall spend a few words about them. Later in the book these
facts we be needed, especially when we deal with superselection rules.
9In R this is the identity map, in C the standard conjugation, and in H it is a + bi + cj + dk :=
a −bi −cj −dk for every a, b, c, d ∈R.

The point is to start from a von Neumann algebra R (also called W ∗-algebra,
Deﬁnition3.90) on a (not necessarily separable) Hilbert space H ̸= {0}, as opposed
to the complete lattice L (H). Then consider the logic of the von Neumann algebra
R:
LR(H) := R ∩L (H) ,
i.e., the set of orthogonal projectors belonging to R. Here LR(H) represents the
actual set of elementary propositions associated to the physical system, and self-
adjoint elements in R are interpreted as bounded observables (this will be clearer
in Chap.11). There is a intimate relationship between R and LR(H) as the latter
generates the former as a von Neumann algebra. Moreover the poset structure of
LR(H) is very similar to the one on the whole L (H), and allows for analogous
physical interpretations. Everything is stated in the following proposition.
Proposition 7.61 Let R be a von Neumann algebra on the complex Hilbert space
H ̸= {0} and LR(H) the set of orthogonal projectors P ∈R. The following facts
hold.
(a) LR(H) is an orthomodular (hence bounded and orthocomplemented) complete
lattice, with structure inherited from L (H).
(b) The von Neumann algebra generated by LR(H) is R itself:
R = LR(H)′′ .
(c) The centre of the lattice generates the centre of the algebra,

LR(H) ∩LR(H)′′′ = R ∩R′ .
(d) R is a factor (Deﬁnition3.90) if and only if LR(H) is irreducible.
(e) R = B(H) if and only if LR′(H) = {0, I}.
Proof (a) LR(H) trivially inherits a poset structure from L (H), including a mini-
mum and a maximum because 0, I ∈LR(H). It also inherits the orthocomplemented
structure from L (H). In fact, if P, Q ∈LR(H), P ∧Q in L (H) can be com-
puted by (7.32). Since R is closed in the strong operator topology, P ∧Q ∈LR(H)
and, in particular, the ∧(inf) of L (H) must coincide with the meet of LR(H)
since LR(H) ⊂L (H). Next observe that ¬P = I −P ∈R if P ∈LR(H), since
R is an algebra. Thus ¬P ∈LR(H) if P ∈LR(H). Consequently, P ∨Q =
¬(¬P ∧¬Q) ∈LR(H) if P, Q ∈LR(H), and the ∨(sup) of L (H) must coin-
cide with the join of LR(H) since LR(H) ⊂L (H). Very easily, orthomodularity
passes from L (H) to LR(H). At this stage LR(H) is just an orthocomplemented,
orthomodular lattice with the induced operations. More difﬁcult is to establish com-
pleteness. From (iii) in Theorem7.22(a)
∧α∈A Pα = ¬ (∨α∈A¬Pα) ,

7.6 More Advanced, Foundational and Technical Issues
365
if {Pα}α∈A ⊂L (H). Therefore, since the logic LR(H) is closed under ¬, its com-
pleteness is equivalent to
∨α∈A Pα ∈R if {Pα}α∈A ⊂LR(H) ,
(7.47)
where ∨is the join of L (H). Let us prove (7.47). Deﬁne P := ∨α∈A Pα (which
does exist in L (H)). Take X ∈R′ and an element Pα in {Pα}α∈A ⊂LR(H). Since
LR(H) ⊂R, we have Pα X −X Pα = 0. On the other hand P Pα = Pα (since P ≥
Pα) so that
(P X −X P)Pα = P X Pα −X P Pα = P Pα X −X P Pα = Pα X −X Pα = 0 .
In other words Pα(H) ⊂Ker(P X −X P). If K denotes the orthogonal projec-
tor onto Ker(P X −X P), we therefore have K ≥Pα. That inequality is valid for
every Pα, so it must also hold for the supremum of the Pα. Hence K ≥P, so that
(P X −X P)P = 0, i.e., P X P = X P. Since X ∈R′ is arbitrary and R′ is closed
under Hermitian conjugation, starting with X∗in place of X gives P X∗P = X∗P
and the adjoint relation P X P = P X. This and the earlier, analogous condition prove
X P = P X. We have established that P ∈(R′)′ = R, and therefore (7.47) holds.
(b) Here we need a few (independent) results from Chap.8. As LR(H) ⊂R, we have
R′ ⊂LR(H)′ and ﬁnally LR(H)′′ ⊂R′′ = R. Let us prove that LR(H)′′ ⊃R to
conclude. Since the von Neumann algebra LR(H)′′ is closed in the strong oper-
ator topology (Theorem3.88), it is sufﬁcient to prove that if A ∈R, there is a
sequence of elements An ∈LR(H)′′ such that An →A strongly. As A = 1
2(A +
A∗) + i 1
2i (A −A∗) and both 1
2(A + A∗) and 1
2i (A −A∗) are self-adjoint elements
of R, we may prove our claim for self-adjoint elements A ∈R. Since self-adjoint
operators of B(H) are normal, we can apply the spectral theorem for bounded nor-
mal operators Theorem8.56, and write A =

K xd P(A)(x) where {P(A)(E)}E∈B(R)
is the PVM associated to A, and K ⊂R is a sufﬁciently large compact set con-
taining the spectrum of A. By Theorem8.56(c) P(A)(E) =

K χE(x)d P(A)(x) com-
mutes with every bounded operator commuting with A (and A∗= A) where χE
is the characteristic function of the Borel set E ⊂R. As A ∈R = (R′)′, P(A)(E)
commutes with every element of R′ and thus P(A)(E) ∈R′′ = R. In particular,
P(A)(E) ∈LR(H) because it is an orthogonal projector. Finally, consider a bounded
sequence of simple functions sn tending pointwise to id : K ∋x →x ∈R (such a
sequence exists as a consequence of Proposition1.49). Then Theorem8.54(c) yields

K sn(x)d P(A)(x) →A strongly as n →+∞. On the other hand
An =

K
sn(x)d P(A)(x) =
Nn

k=1
skn P(A)(Ekn)
commutes with every operator which commutes with the elements of LR(H) because
we saw P(A)(Ekn) ∈LR(H). We conclude that An ∈LR(H)′′. Summarising, we
have found that LR(H)′′ ∋An →A strongly, as we wanted.

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
(c) From (b), LR(H)′ = LR(H)′′′ = R′ so that LR(H) ∩LR(H)′ ⊂R ∩R′. As
the right-hand side is a von Neumann algebra, it contains the smallest von Neumann
algebra containing the left-hand side: (LR(H) ∩LR(H)′)′′ ⊂R ∩R′. Let us estab-
lish the converse inclusion. We will prove that if A ∈R ∩R′, there is a sequence
< LR(H) ∩LR(H)′ >=< LR(H) ∩R′ >∋An →A strongly, where < A > is
the space of ﬁnite, complex linear combinations of elements of A ⊂B(H). As
(LR(H) ∩LR(H)′)′′ ⊃< LR(H) ∩LR(H)′ >
and
(LR(H) ∩LR(H)′)′′
is
strongly closed, this concludes the proof. It sufﬁces to restrict to self-adjoint oper-
ators A in view of the same argument used to prove (b). If A∗= A ∈R ∩R′, the
spectral measure P(A) of A belongs to R and commutes with the same operators
of B(H) commuting with A (Theorem8.56). Therefore P(A)(E) ∈LR(H) ∩R′ =
LR(H) ∩LR(H)′ for every Borel set E ⊂R. In analogy to part (b) we can construct
An ∈< LR(H) ∩LR(H)′ > with
An =
Nn

k=1
skn P(A)(Ekn) →A strongly as n →+∞,
for some real numbers skn and Borel sets Ekn ⊂R. This concludes the proof of (c).
(d) From (c), if LR(H) is irreducible, LR(H) ∩LR(H)′ = {0, I} so that (LR(H) ∩
LR(H)′)′ = B(H) and thus R is a factor because
R ∩R′ =

LR(H) ∩LR(H)′′′ = {cI}c∈C .
Conversely, if LR(H) is not irreducible, there is a non-trivial orthogonal projector
P in LR(H)′ ∩R. In particular P commutes with every spectral measure of every
self-adjoint operator A ∈R, hence it commutes with A itself by the spectral decom-
position of A (Theorem8.56). Since every element of R is a linear combination of
two self-adjoint elements of R, P ∈R′ ∩R and hence R cannot be a factor.
(e) R = B(H) is equivalent to R′ = {cI}c∈C (Proposition3.93). If R′ = {cI}c∈C then
LR′(H) = {0, I}. On the other hand, if LR′(H) = {0, I}, then R′ = LR′(H)′′ =
{0, I}′′ = B(H)′ = {cI}c∈C. □
Ultimately it is possible to choose R so that LR(H) becomes modular. This hap-
pens for certain factors (Deﬁnition3.90), i.e. von Neumann algebras R with trivial
centre, R′ ∩R = {cI}c∈C. The classiﬁcation of factors of Murray and von Neumann
proves, among other things, that only the logic LR(H) of so-called factors of type
I I1 is modular if H is not ﬁnite-dimensional. Although modularity is nowadays no
longer deemed fundamental, and some of von Neumann motivations have proved
indefensible,10 von Neumann algebras, factors, and the classiﬁcation and study of
factors have been decisive for the development of the mathematical formulation of
quantum theories, including algebraic Quantum Field Theories [Haa96].
10See Rédei in [EGL09] and it was established by Piron that modularity is incompatible with
localisability of elementary particles [Pir64, p. 452].

7.6 More Advanced, Foundational and Technical Issues

Whereas in algebraic Quantum Field Theory all types of factors are relevant,
the factors that play a role in standard QM are the so-called factors of type I (spe-
cial ∗-algebras isomorphic to some B(K), see below). This fact easily implies that
the bounded, orthomodular, complete, irreducible lattices of projectors onto type-I
factors are also atomic, hence atomistic (Remark7.57(1)), and satisfy the covering
property. The projector lattice of factors of other types, though bounded, orthomod-
ular, complete and irreducible, does not contain atoms.
Following Murray and von Neumann (for a complete account, see [Tau61]), fac-
tors are classiﬁed in the following way (see [Red98, Pan93] for a quick report, and
[Tak00, vol. I], [KaRi97, vol. II] for a complete and detailed discussion on the sub-
ject). If R is a von Neumann algebra in the complex (non-separable, in general)
Hilbert space H we deﬁne an equivalence relation on LR(H),
P ∼Q for P, Q ∈LR(H) means that there is a partial isometry U ∈R such that
P = U ∗U and Q = UU ∗.
(Refer to Deﬁnition3.72 and Proposition3.74.) In other words, P is equivalent to Q
if and only if there is a Hilbert-space isomorphism P(H) →Q(H), and the map U
that extends it on P(H)⊥, where U = 0, belongs to R.
This equivalence relation has the property that, if Pi ∼Qi for i = 1, 2 and P1 ⊥
P2 and Q1 ⊥Q2, we also have P1 + P2 ∼Q1 + Q2.
We next introduce an order relation on LR(H) by saying that P ⪯Q when
P ∼P′ ≤Q for some P′ ∈LR(H).
Deﬁnition 7.62 If R is a von Neumann algebra over the complex Hilbert space
H ̸= {0}, an element P ∈LR(H) is said to be
(a) ﬁnite if P ∼Q ≤P for some Q ∈R ⇒P = Q (P is not equivalent to any
proper subprojector);
(b) inﬁnite if it is not ﬁnite;
(c) properly inﬁnite if P ̸= 0 is inﬁnite and QP is either 0 or inﬁnite for every
Q ∈LR(H) that is central (in the centre of R).
It is possible to prove that LR(H)/∼, with the order relation induced by ⪯, is totally
ordered if R is a factor. Moreover, the following crucial result holds (see for instance
[Red98] for a short exposition).
Proposition 7.63 If R is a factor for the complex Hilbert space H ̸= {0}, there exists
a map (unique up to a positive multiplicative constant) d : LR(H) →[0, +∞] such
that
(i) d(P) = 0 ⇔P = 0,
(ii) d(P) = d(Q) ⇔P ∼Q,
(iii) d(P) ≤d(Q) ⇔P ⪯Q,
(iv) d(P) < +∞⇔P is a ﬁnite projection,
(v) d(P) + d(Q) = d(P ∧Q) + d(P ∨Q),
(vi) d(P + Q) = d(P) + d(Q) if P ⊥Q,
for any P, Q ∈LR(H).

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
The map d, called the dimension function on LR(H), has necessarily one of the
following ranges – after suitable normalisation, depending on the nature of the factor
R:
1. Type In: d(LR(H)) = {0, 1, . . . , n} where n = 1, 2, . . . , ∞.
2. Type I I1: d(LR(H)) = [0, 1].
3. Type I I∞: d(LR(H)) = [0, ∞) ∪{∞}.
4. Type I I I: d(LR(H)) = {0, ∞}, where d(P) = 0 only if P = 0.
The factor R is called of type In, I I1, I I∞, I I I in accordance with the above table
for d. Factors of type I∞can be further subdivided in more reﬁned types, still denoted
by In, where now n indicates an inﬁnite cardinal number, whose meaning will be
discussed shortly. With this reﬁnement the classiﬁcation is exhaustive: a factor is
necessarily of one, and only one, type among In, I I1, I I∞and I I I, where n can be
any non-zero cardinal (ﬁnite or inﬁnite).
Henceforth, by a type-I factor we shall mean a factor of type In with n > 0 a
ﬁnite or inﬁnite cardinal, while type-I∞will indicate a factor for type In with n
inﬁnite. Similarly, a type-I I factor may be of type I I1 or I I∞. The next result can
be found as a subcase of Theorem9.1.3 and Example9.1.5 in [KaRi97, vol. II]. It
is technically important for it relates a factor R with R′ (the commutant is a factor
since R and R′ have the same centre).
Proposition 7.64 A factor R on a complex Hilbert space H ̸= {0} is of type In, I I
or I I I if and only if its commutant R′ is of type Im, I I or I I I respectively, where
n, m are arbitrary cardinals.
Type-I factors enjoy very nice properties [KaRi97, vol. II]:
(a) among the factors of type In, with n > 0 ﬁnite or inﬁnite, are the minimal
projectors, i.e. the atoms of the projector lattice;
(b) type-In factors are ∗-isomorphic to B(Hn), where dim(Hn) = n may be inﬁ-
nite. As a matter of fact, there exist Hilbert spaces Hn, Hm of dimensions n, m
and a unitary operator U : H →Hn ⊗Hm such that URU −1 = B(Hn) ⊗CIm, and
UR′U −1 = CIn ⊗B(Hm),where Il istheidentityonHl (thenotionoftensorproduct
will be introduced in Sect.10.2). This property can actually be taken as a deﬁnition
of type-In factors;
(c) only factors of type In may be irreducible (R is irreducible iff R′ = {cI}c∈C.
Since {cI}c∈C is of type I1, R = {cI}′
c∈C must be of type I by Proposition7.64.)
Other general features of the lattices of orthogonal projectors for the various factors
are listed below (see [Tak00, KaRi97] and [Red98] for a summary).
The projector lattice of type-In factors, with ﬁnite n, is non-distributive for n ≥2,
modular and, as already said atomic (thus atomistic because orthomodular); more-
over, d(P) = dim P(Hn).
The projector lattice of type-I∞factors is orthomodular, non-modular, atomic
(thus atomistic because orthomodular).
The projector lattice of type-I I1 factors is modular but non-atomic.
The projector lattice of type-I I∞and type-I I I factors is neither modular nor
atomic.

Von Neumann algebras R that are not factors can be classiﬁed, similarly, in
disjoint types: In, I I1, I I∞, I I I. In contrast to the previous sorting, however, this
classiﬁcation does not exhaust all instances, for there are W ∗-algebras that do not
belong to any one class above. But every von Neumann algebra is a direct sum of the
above types. This classiﬁcation of von Neumann algebras of deﬁnite type requires a
pair of deﬁnitions.
Deﬁnition 7.65 Let R be a von Neumann algebra over the complex Hilbert space
H ̸= {0}.
(a) A ﬁnite projector P ∈LR(H) is called Abelian if PRP := {P AP | A ∈R} is
an Abelian W ∗-algebra.
(b) If A ∈R, its central carrier is the orthogonal projector CA := I −PA where
PA := ∨{P ∈LR(H) ∩R′ | P A = 0}.
We are in a position to state the involved classiﬁcation of von Neumann algebras of
deﬁnite type (see [Tak00, vol. I], [KaRi97, vol. II] and the discussion in [BEH07,
Chap.6]).
Deﬁnition 7.66 A von Neumann algebra R over the Hilbert space H ̸= {0} is said
to be
(a) of type I if LR(H) contains an Abelian projector with central carrier I; it is,
further, of type In if I is the orthogonal sum of n equivalent Abelian projectors (n
can be any ﬁnite or inﬁnite cardinal);
(b) of type I I if LR(H) does not contain any non-zero Abelian projectors, but
contains a central projector with central carrier I; it is of type I I1 if I is ﬁnite, and
of type I I∞when I is properly inﬁnite;
(c) of type I I I if LR(H) has no non-zero ﬁnite projectors.
All these types are pairwise distinct, so in particular In and Im are different if n ̸= m.
The fundamental link between the classiﬁcation of factors and the classiﬁcation of
von Neumann algebras of deﬁnite type is the following: A factor is of type In, I I1,
I I∞or I I I if and only if it is of type In, I I1, I I∞or I I I respectively, as a von
Neumann algebra.
Conversely, in a separable Hilbert space, (see the paragraph below Remark7.69)
a von Neumann algebra is of type In, I I1, I I∞, I I I if and only if it is a direct integral
of factors of type, respectively, In, I I1, I I∞, I I I.
Remark 7.67 The von Neumann algebras of quantum ﬁeld operators associated to
bounded regions in Minkowski spacetime are usually of type I I I, while the whole
algebra may be a factor of type I or I I I depending on the state used to construct
the representation: type I is typical for ground states and type I I I for extended
thermodynamical (KMS) states. These types also appear in the theory when one
describes extended thermodynamical systems. After the breakthrough brought by the
Tomita–Takesaki modular theory [Haa96], and its implications in thermodynamical
Quantum Field Theory, at the end of the 1960s, it became possible for Connes
to further reﬁne the classiﬁcation of type-I I I algebras in an uncountable family
of algebras of type I I Iλ, λ ∈[0, 1] [KaRi97]. Type I I I1 is of particular interest in

physics. A nice and rapid discussion on the occurrence of these types of von Neumann
algebras and factors for describing quantum physical systems, with all the relevant
references, can be found in [ReSu07].

7.6.3
Direct Decomposition into Factors and Deﬁnite-Type
von Neumann Algebras and Factors
A number of theoretical results later mentioned in the book will require that we
know a crucial result concerning the decomposition of a von Neumann algebra into
deﬁnite-type algebras (a reformulation of Theorem6.5.2 in [KaRi97]).
Theorem 7.68 (Type decomposition) Let R be a von Neumann algebra on the
Hilbert space H ̸= {0}. There is a unique family {Q j} j∈J ⊂LR(H) ∩LR(H)′ with
(i) Q j ̸= 0,
(ii) Q j ⊥Qi if i ̸= j,
(iii) ∨j∈J Q j = I,
such that
H =

j∈J
H( j) and R =

j∈J
R( j) ,
(7.48)
where H( j) := Q j(H), R( j) := Q jR↾H( j)⊂B(H( j)) and the direct sums refer to Def-
inition3.98. Moreover, each von Neumann algebra R( j) is of deﬁnite type In (for any
possible ﬁnite or inﬁnite cardinal 0 < n ≤dim(H)), I I1, I I∞, and I I I, and each
such type appears at most once in the sums.
Remark 7.69 (1) A von Neumann algebra is said to be of type I∞if it is a sum (as
in (7.48)) of von Neumann algebras of type In where every n is inﬁnite.
(2) It follows from the theorem ([KaRi97, vol. II], p. 422) that, if P ∈LR(H) \ {0}
is central and the von Neumann algebra R is of type In, I I1, I I∞or I I I, then the
von Neumann algebra PR := {P A | A ∈R} has the same deﬁnite type.
(3) Proposition7.64 is valid for general von Neumann algebras R [KaRi97, vol. II,
Theorem9.1.3], if one replaces In and Im by I.
■
Von Neumann proved a related result, that in a sense [BrRo02] is ﬁner than Theo-
rem7.68: if a Hilbert space H is separable, von Neumann algebras on H can always
be written as direct integrals of factors which, as we know, are of deﬁned type. Let us
show how this decomposition arises and how it is related to Theorem7.68. We shall
consider a simpliﬁed situation where the centre of the associated projector lattice is
atomic and the direct integral becomes a Hilbert sum. This is the only case that is
truly relevant for this book. Besides, H does not even need to be separable.
Given a von Neumann algebra R on a Hilbert space H, by Zorn’s lemma the
centre R ∩R′ (i.e. the centre LR(H) ∩LR(H)′) contains a maximal set of non-
vanishing orthogonal projectors {Pk}k∈K such that Pk ⊥Ph if k ̸= h. At this point we

7.6 More Advanced, Foundational and Technical Issues
371
make the non-trivial assumption that there exists a maximal set of central pairwise-
orthogonal projectors such that, for every ﬁxed k ∈K, there is no projector Q ∈
R ∩R′ satisfying 0 ≤Q ≤Pk and Q ̸= 0, Pk. In other words the central projectors
Pk are atoms of LR∩R′(H). This condition determines uniquely this maximal family,
and the following result holds.
Proposition 7.70 Let R be a von Neumann algebra on the complex Hilbert space
H ̸= {0} and {Pk}k∈K ⊂LR(H) a family of orthogonal projectors such that:
(i) every Pk is non-zero and central: 0 ̸= Pk ∈R ∩R′,
(ii) Pk ⊥Ph if k ̸= h,
(iii) the family is maximal (among all families satisfying (i)-(ii)),
(iv) each Pk is an atom of R ∩R′.
Then the following facts hold.
(a) Irrespective of (iv), the set of conditions (i), (ii), (iii) is equivalent to the set
(i), (ii), (iii)’ where
(iii)’ ∨k∈K Pk = I .
(b) The family {Pk}h∈K ⊂LR(H) satisfying (i)-(iv) is unique up to term relabelling.
(c) Every closed subspace Hk := Pk(H) is invariant under R, i.e.,
A(Hk) ⊂Hk
if A ∈R .
(d) Each map
R ∋A →πk(A) := A↾Hk: Hk →Hk
is a ∗-algebra representation of R.
(e) Each Rk := πk(R) is a factor on the Hilbert space Hk.
(f) We have splittings
H =

k∈K
Hk ,
R =

k∈K
Rk ,
(7.49)
called direct decompositions into factors.
(g) There is a partition K = ⊔j∈J K j such that
H( j) =

k∈K j
Hk
and R( j) =

k∈K j
Rk ,
(7.50)
where H( j) and R( j) are the closed subspaces and deﬁnite-type W ∗-algebras of
Theorem7.68. In particular, each factor Rk with k ∈K j has the same type as the
corresponding R( j).
Proof (a) Assume that (i)–(iii) are valid. The element 
k∈K Pk = ∨k∈K Pk (the
sum is in the strong operator topology, and we use this notation everywhere in
the proof, considering families of pairwise-orthogonal projectors), exists in R ∩R′
(a von Neumann algebra, hence strongly closed). Therefore (iii)’ follows, for oth-
erwise I −
k∈K Pk ̸= 0 would be central and orthogonal to every Pk, contra-
dicting maximality. If, conversely, (i),(ii),(iii)’ hold, take a central projector Q

372

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
satisfying Q ⊥Pk for all k ∈K. We therefore have Pk Q = QPk = 0 and thus
Qx = Q 
k∈K Pkx = 
k∈K QPx = 0 for every x ∈H so that Q = 0 and (i) is
false. This means {Pk}k∈K is maximal ((iii) holds) if we require (i),(ii), (iii)’.
(b) Let us pass to the uniqueness property. If {Qh}h∈H is another maximal set of non-
vanishing, pairwise-orthogonal, atomic and central orthogonal projectors, we have
Pk Qh = Qh Pk and so Pk Qh is an orthogonal projector with Pk Qh ≤Pk. Under our
hypotheses either Pk Qh = Pk or Pk Qh = 0. Since Qh = 
k∈K Pk Qh we also have
Qh = 
k∈Kh Pk for some subset Kh ⊂K. If Kh is contained more than one index,
Qh would not be an atom. We conclude that Qh = Pkh for a unique kh depending on
h. The condition 
h Qh = I implies that kh ranges over the whole K when h ∈H,
since 
k∈K ′ Pk < I if K ′ is properly included in K. Therefore {Qh}h∈H and {Pk}h∈K
denote the same set.
(c)–(d). We observe that any element of R commutes with every central projector Pk,
and therefore the closed subspace Hk := Pk(H) is invariant under the whole algebra
R. Moreover
R ∋A →πk(A) := A↾Hk: Hk →Hk
is a ∗-algebra representation of R, the proof being straightforward.
(e) The space Rk := πk(R) ⊂B(Hk) contains I and is ∗-closed. We claim that
Rk is strongly closed, and hence a von Neumann algebra (Theorem3.88). Suppose
Rk ∋Bn →B ∈B(Hk) strongly. We know that Bn = An↾Hk for some An ∈R, so
that An Pkφ →B′φ foreveryφ ∈Hwhere B′ extends B as0 onH⊥
k .Then B′ ∈R,for
it is the strong limit of An Pk ∈R and R is a von Neumann algebra. By construction,
if ψ ∈Hk, B′ψ = B′↾Hk ψ and so Bnψ = An Pkψ →B′ψ = B′↾Hk ψ = πk(B′)ψ.
Consequently Rk is strongly closed, as required. Now, R′
k is a factor because, if Q
is an orthogonal projector in the centre of R′
k, by extending it to the zero operator on
H⊥
k we obtain an orthogonal projector Q′ in the centre of R which satisﬁes Q′ ≤Pk.
Under our hypotheses either Q′ = 0 or Q′ = Pk, viz. Q = 0 or Q = Ik (the identity
in Rk) and hence Rk is a factor due to Proposition7.61(d).
(f) In terms of subspaces, I = ∨k∈K Pk means H = < Hk >k∈K. Since Pk ̸= 0 and
Pk ⊥Ph if k ̸= h, just by deﬁnition of Hilbert sum we ﬁnd H = ⊕k∈KHk. With
this decomposition of H, applying Deﬁnition3.98 immediately gives R = 
k∈K Rk
where Rk = πk(R).
(g) To prove the last statement, let Pk be a central orthogonal projector onto Hk and
Q j a central projector in the type-decomposition of Theorem7.68. The following
facts hold: (1) if Pk ≤Q j then Q j is uniquely determined by Pk. (Since Q j ⊥Qi
for i ̸= j, if Pk ≤Qi, i.e., Pk = Pk Qi, we also have Pk = Pk Q j = Pk Qi Q j = 0,
a contradiction). (2) For every Pk there exists Q jk such that Pk ≤Q jk. (Pk Q j ≤Pk
and, as Pk is an atom of the centre, either Pk Q j = 0 or Pk Q j = Pk. If Pk Q j = 0 for
every j ∈J, since 
j∈J Q j = I, we would have Pk = 
j∈J Pk Q j = 0, impossi-
ble.) (3) Every Q j satisﬁes Pk j ≤Q j for some k j ∈K. (Since Q j = 
k∈K Q j Pk
and Q j Pk ≤Pk we have either Q j Pk = 0 or Q j Pk = Pk because Pk is an atom of
the centre. Hence Q j = 
k∈K j Pk and Pk j ≤Q j if k j ∈K j.) Summing up, K can
be decomposed in non-empty, pairwise-disjoint subsets K j = {k ∈K | Pk ≤Q j}
where j ∈J. Furthermore, rephrasing (1), (2) and (3) in terms of Rk = PkR and

7.6 More Advanced, Foundational and Technical Issues
373
R( j) = Q jR, we ﬁnd that each factor Rk is contained in a unique von Neumann
algebra R( jk), so that Rk has the same type of R( jk) (Remark7.69(2)). Moreover,
every von Neumann algebra R( j) contains a factor Rk, necessarily of the same type.
Finally, since Q j = 
k∈K j Pk (where Pk ⊥Ph if k ̸= h), (7.50) holds true. □
It is mathematically relevant that the four requirements (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) (or (i), (ii),
(iii)’, (iv)) are together equivalent to a unique demand on the centre of LR(H).
Proposition 7.71 Let R be a von Neumann algebra on the complex Hilbert space
H ̸= {0}. Then R contains a (unique) family {Pk}k∈K ⊂LR(H) satisfying (i)-(iv)
of Proposition7.70 if and only if the centre of the lattice LR(H) is atomic (Deﬁni-
tion7.54).
Proof If the centre of LR(H) is an atomic lattice, there are sets of pairwise orthog-
onal atoms. Zorn’s lemma immediately proves that there are maximal such sets.
A maximal set of pairwise orthogonal atoms {Pk}k∈K satisﬁes (i)-(iv) evidently.
Suppose, conversely, that the family of central projectors {Pk}k∈K satisﬁes (i)–(iv)
and therefore (iii)’ of Proposition7.70 in particular. Let Q ∈LR(H) ∩LR(H)′. We
have Q = ∨k∈K QPk where the projectors QPk and QPh are orthogonal if h ̸= k. If
Q ̸= 0, there must be l ∈K with QPl ̸= 0. As QPl ≤Pl, and since Pl is an atom, we
also have Pl = QPl ≤Q. The arbitrariness of Q implies that the centre of LR(H)
is atomic. □
We have seen that R can be decomposed into a direct sum of factors. However, to
achieve this nice result, we made the overall quite strong assumption that the centre
of the lattice LR(H) is atomic or, equivalently, that it contains a maximal set of
pairwise orthogonal atoms {Pk}k∈K. Similar central maximal sets always exist by
Zorn’s lemma, but there is no guarantee that they are made of atoms of the centre.
In the general case, if H is separable, a ﬁner but analogous decomposition of a von
Neumann algebra can be constructed in terms of a direct integral of factors, taking
the place of the Hilbert sum. This generalised decomposition reduces to (7.49) as
soon as the centre is atomic. In the general case, the direct integral decomposition
into factors is essentially unique.

Gleason’s Theorem for Lattices of von Neumann
Algebras
There is a version of Gleason’s theorem that holds for measures on lattices of von
Neumann algebras. It necessitates certain conditions [Mae89] on the deﬁnite-type
decomposition of the von Neumann algebra.
Theorem 7.72 (General Gleason theorem) Consider a von Neumann algebra R on
a complex Hilbert space H ̸= {0} whose deﬁnite-type decomposition (Theorem7.68)
does not include a type-I2 algebra. Denote, as before, by LR(H) the (orthomodular,
complete) lattice of orthogonal projectors in R.

Each of the following three conditions is equivalent to the existence of a positive,

hand side of (7.52) is well-deﬁned because its terms are non-negative).
(ii) μ admits a support, namely an element P ∈LR(H) such that μ(Q) = 0 for
Q ∈LR(H) if and only if Q ⊥P.
(iii)

μ(I)μ is the restriction of a normal algebraic state on the C∗-algebra R
(Deﬁnition14.10).
Remark 7.73 (1) If H is separable the theorem immediately implies that μ is auto-
matically represented by an operator of trace class. This is because every family of
pairwise orthogonal projectors is at most countable if H is separable, so μ is auto-
matically completely additive since σ-additive. In contrast to the case R = B(H),
the trace-class operator representing μ is not unique in general.
(2) A probability measure μT over a von Neumann algebra R on H (possibly with
type-I2 summands) that is induced by a positive trace-class operator T of trace one is
called a normal state of R. Such a measure is nothing but the restriction to LR(H)
of the measure deﬁned by Proposition7.25 on L (H). A normal state as understood
in (iii) is more appropriately the functional ωT := R ∋A →tr(T A). However, it is
obvious that ωT↾LR(H)= μT . The general notion of normal (algebraic) state will be
introduced and discussed in Chap.14.

Algebraic Characterisation of a State as a
Noncommutative Riesz Theorem
This section is purely mathematical, and focuses on a characterisation of the space
of states S(H). The description has a certain interest for the algebraic formulation of
QM [Str05a] and quantum theories in general, which we will brieﬂy see in Sect.14.1.
Its mathematical relevance resides in that it implies a noncommutative version of
Riesz’s Theorem1.58 on (ﬁnite) positive Borel measures. The word noncommutative

7.6 More Advanced, Foundational and Technical Issues

refers to measures on the projector lattice L (H) in the sense of axiom A2 (measure-
theory version), rather than on a σ-algebra.
First of all observe that a positive trace-class operator T determines a linear
functional of the C∗-algebra of compact operators B∞(H), given by ωT : B∞(H) →
C, ωT (A) = tr(T A). This is positive:
ωT (A∗A) ≥0 for any A ∈B∞(H).
(7.53)
Infact,tr(A∗T A) = tr(A∗T 1/2T 1/2 A) = tr((T 1/2 A)∗T 1/2 A) ≥0.Thelastinequal-
ity comes from expanding the trace in some basis of H. Viewing ωT as linear operator
on the Banach space B∞(H) (with the norm of B(H)), we have
||ωT || = trT .
(7.54)
In fact, if A ∈B∞(H) and ||A|| ≤1, taking the trace in a basis {ψ j} j∈J of eigen-
vectors of T = T ∗gives
|ωT (A)| ≤

j∈J
|p j(ψ j|Aψ j)| ≤

j∈J
p j||Aψ j|| ≤

j∈J
p j = trT .
Eventually ωT (AN) →trT , as N →+∞, if AN := 
0≤p j<N ψ j(ψ j| ), where
||AN|| ≤1 and AN ∈B∞(H) because the latter’s range is ﬁnite-dimensional (see
Example4.18(1)).
Deﬁnition 7.74 Let H be a complex Hilbert space. Positive and linear functionals
ω : B∞(H) →C of unit norm are called algebraic states on the C∗-algebra B∞(H).
Their set will be denoted C(B∞(H)).
Therefore every state T ∈S(H) determines an algebraic state ωT ∈C(B∞(H)).
This can be accompanied by the following characterisation.
Theorem 7.75 If H is a complex Hilbert space, the mapping S(H) ∋T →ωT ∈
C(B∞(H)), with ωT (A) = tr(T A), A ∈B∞(H), is well deﬁned and bijective.
Equivalently: states in S(H) are in one-to-one correspondence with algebraic states
in C(B∞(H)).
Proof The map T →ωT is well deﬁned by the above argument, and also one-to-
one: if ωT = ωT ′ in fact, then tr((T −T ′)A) = 0 for any compact operator A. By
decomposing the self-adjoint, trace-class operator T −T ′ over an eigenvector basis
{φi}i∈I and choosing A = φi(φi| ) for any i ∈I, we conclude the eigenvalues of
T −T ′ must all vanish, so T −T ′ = 0 by (6) in Theorem4.19(b).
Let us prove the surjectivity of T →ωT . Considering ω ∈C(B∞(H)) we try to
ﬁnd T ∈S(H) such that ω = ωT . If ψ, φ ∈H, deﬁne Aψ,φ := ψ(φ| ) ∈B∞(H).
By deﬁnition of norm ||Aψ,φ|| = ||ψ|| ||φ||. The coefﬁcients ω(φ, ψ) := ω(Aψ,φ)
deﬁne a function H × H →C, linear in the right argument and antilinear in the
left one. Further, |ω(φ, ψ)| = |ω(Aψ,φ)| ≤1||Aψ,φ|| = ||ψ|| ||φ||. Then Riesz’s

376
7
The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
representation Theorem3.16 implies there is a linear map T ′ : H →H such that
ω(Aψ,φ) = (T ′ψ|φ), for any ψ, φ ∈H. As ||T ′ψ||2 = |(T ′ψ|T ′ψ)| = |ω(Aψ,T ′ψ)|
≤||ψ|| ||T ′ψ||, we conclude ||T ′|| ≤1. Setting T := T ′∗, we have an operator
T ∈B(H) with ||T|| ≤1 and ω(Aψ,φ) = (ψ|T φ) for any ψ, φ ∈H. As ω is posi-
tive, taking ψ = φ implies T ≥0, so in particular T = T ∗and |T | = T . Now take a
Hilbert basis N of H. If F ⊂N is ﬁnite deﬁne L F := 
z∈F z(z| ). By construction
L F ∈B∞(H) and ||L F|| ≤1 (orthogonal projector). Therefore
0 ≤

(z||T|z) =

z∈F
ω(Az,z) = ω (L F) = |ω (L F) | ≤||ω|| .
But F is arbitrary, so 
z∈N(z||T |z) ≤1 < +∞, and by deﬁnition of trace class, T ∈
B1(H). Splitting T over an eigenvector basis, T = 
i∈I piψi(ψi| ) (by construction
pi ≥0, trT = 
i pi ≤||ω||), and taking the trace, by linearity we have
|ω(A)| = |tr(T A)| ≤

i∈I
pi|(ψi|Aψi)| ≤(trT )||A||
if A ∈B∞(H) is a ﬁnite combination of the Aψ,φ. Since the above operators A
are dense in B∞(H) in the uniform topology (Theorem4.23), by continuity and
linearity ω(A) = tr(T A) and |ω(A)| ≤trT ||A|| for any A ∈B∞(H). The latter
tells ||ω|| ≤tr(T); but since we know trT ≤||ω||, then trT = ||ω||. In particular
trT = 1, for ||ω|| = 1 by assumption. Hence we have ω = ωT for some T ∈S(H),
rendering the map onto. □
Remark 7.76 One fact becomes evident from the proof: we may drop the hypothesis
that ω has unit norm, and demand, more weakly, that the norm be ﬁnite. Then the
positive operator Tω ∈B1(H) corresponding to ω will satisfy tr(Tω) = ||ω||.
■
We wish to interpret the result in the light of the theory of the probability measure
ρ on the lattice L (H), in the sense of axiom A2 (measure-theory version). To this
end recall Riesz’s theorem on positive Borel measures Theorem1.58 on the locally
compact Hausdorff space X. Consider, slightly modifying the theorem’s hypotheses,
positive linear functionals Λ : C0(X) →C, where C0(X) is the space of continuous
complex functions on X that vanish at inﬁnity with norm || ||∞(Example2.29(4)).
Proposition 7.77 If X is locally compact, Hausdorff and Λ : C0(X) →C is a
bounded positive linear functional (with norm || ||∞on the domain), there exists
a unique positive and σ-additive regular measure μΛ on B(X), such that Λ( f ) =

X f dμΛ for any f ∈C0(X). Moreover μΛ is ﬁnite and ||Λ|| = μΛ(X).
Proof The restriction Λ↾Cc(X) gives a positive functional as in Riesz’s Theorem1.58.
Applying the theorem produces a measure μΛ : B(X) →[0, +∞] mapping com-
pact sets to a ﬁnite measure, uniquely determined by Λ( f ) =

X f dμΛ, f ∈Cc(X),
if we impose μΛ is regular. So we assume regularity from now on. If Λ is
bounded, easily μΛ(X) = ||Λ||, so μΛ(X) is ﬁnite. (For any f ∈C0(X) we have

7.6 More Advanced, Foundational and Technical Issues
377
|Λ( f )| ≤

X | f |dμλ ≤|| f ||∞μΛ(X), hence ||Λ|| ≤||μΛ(X)||. For any compact
set K ⊂X, by local compactness and Hausdorff’s property, Urysohn’s lemma
(Theorem1.24) gives fK ∈Cc(X) such that f : X →[0, 1] with fK(K) = {1},
so μΛ(K) ≤

X fKdμΛ ≤||Λ|||| fK||∞= ||Λ|| and then μΛ(X) ≤||Λ||, because
μΛ(X) = sup{μΛ(K) | K ⊂X , compact} by inner regularity of μΛ.) That μΛ is
ﬁnite implies that any map of C0(X) can be integrated. Then the above con-
straint on the integral in dμΛ, ﬁxing the regular measure μΛ on B(X), becomes
Λ( f ) =

X f dμΛ for any f ∈C0(X). □
We know that any positive operator T ∈B1(H) gives a generalised measure on
L (H) (a probability measure if trT = 1) in the sense of Proposition7.25. Then
Theorem7.75 implies a noncommutative version of Riesz’s representation theorem
for ﬁnite measures, stated in Proposition7.77. This comes about as follows: think
of the projector lattice L (H) as the noncommutative variant of the Borel σ-algebra
B(X), and the C∗-algebra of compact operators B∞(H) as the noncommutative
correspondent to the commutative C∗-algebra C0(X). (Both algebras are without
unit if H is inﬁnite-dimensional and X non-compact, respectively.) In that case the
bounded positive functional Λ on C0(X) becomes the bounded positive functional
ω on B∞(H). In either case the existence of positive functionals ω, Λ implies the
existence of corresponding ﬁnite measures on L (H), B(X) respectively. The latter
is what we denoted μΛ above, whilst the former is simply deﬁned as ρω(P) :=
tr(TωP) for any P ∈L (H), where Tω ∈B1(H) and ω correspond to one another
as in Theorem7.75 (there Tω was called T and ω was ωT ). The requests ﬁxing μΛ
(assumed regular) and ρω are
Λ( f ) =

X
f (x) dμ(x) ∀f ∈C0(X) and ω(A) = tr(Tω A) ∀A ∈B∞(H)
respectively. The identity ||Λ|| = μΛ(X) now is ||ω|| = trTω.
Remark 7.78 This discussion serves to explain that the generalisation of the integral
of maps in C0(X) with respect to μΛ should be viewed, in the noncommutative
setting, as the trace tr(Tω·) acting on B∞(H). Hence if Tρ ∈B1(H) is the operator
associated (by Remark7.28(3) only) to a probability measure ρ : L (H) →[0, 1]
(fulﬁlling (1) and (2) of axiom A2 (measure-theory version)) by Gleason’s theorem,
we will use the writing

L (H)
Adρ := tr(Tρ A) .
(7.55)
■
Now we can prove the noncommutative version of Proposition7.77.
Theorem 7.79 If H is a complex Hilbert space, separable or of ﬁnite dimension
̸= 2, and ω : B∞(H) →C is a bounded positive linear functional with unit norm,
there exists a unique probability measure ρω : L (H) →[0, 1] (satisfying (1), (2) in
axiom A2 (measure-theory version)), such that:

378

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
ω(A) =

L (H)
Adρω ∀A ∈B∞(H) .
Suppose further ||ω|| is ﬁnite, but not necessarily one. Then ρ : L (H) →[0, ||ω||]
and ρω(I) = ||ω|| instead of ρ(I) = 1.
Proof Deﬁne ρω(P) := tr(Tω P) for any P ∈L (H), where ω and Tω ∈B1(H) cor-
respond bijectively as in Theorem7.75. Then ω(A) = tr(Tω A) =:

L (H) Adρω for
any A ∈B∞(H), because of (7.55) and Tω is by construction associated to the
measure ρω by Gleason’s theorem. (Proposition7.25 ensures ρω fulﬁls (1), (2) in
axiom A2 (measure-theory version)). Let us prove uniqueness. By Gleason’s Theo-
rem7.26 and Remark7.28(3), every probability measure ρ on L (H) satisﬁes ρ(P) =
tr(Tρ P) for a unique positive operator Tρ of trace class with unit trace and any
P ∈L (H). If ω(A) =

L (H) Adρ := tr(Tρ A) for any compact operator A, since we
saw ω(A) = tr(Tω A), choosing A = ψ(ψ| ) will give (ψ|(Tω −Tρ)ψ) = 0 for any
ψ ∈H. Hence Tρ = Tω, and consequently ρ(P) = tr(Tρ P) = tr(TωP) = ρω(P)
for any P ∈L (H). All this extends to the case 0 < ||ω|| ̸= 1, by using the functional
ω′ := ||ω||−1ω. If ||ω|| = 0 then ω = 0. Therefore a possible measure ρ compatible
with 0 = ω(A) = Tr(Tρ A) for any A ∈B∞(H) is the null measure. It is unique by
the same argument. □

Introduction to Superselection Rules
For known quantum systems, not all normalised ψ determine states that are phys-
ically admissible for describing the quantum system. There are various theoretical
reasons (which we shall return to in the sequel) that force the existence of so-called
superselection rules. This section is an introduction to this notion. A more advanced
presentation, relying on spectral theory technicalities that we will discuss in ensuing
chapters, appears in Sect.11.2.
7.7.1
Coherent Sectors, Admissible States and Admissible
Elementary Propositions
For some quantum systems affected by so-called superselection rules, the system’s
(separable) Hilbert space H is a Hilbert sum of preferred closed subspaces called
coherent sectors:
H =

k∈K
Hk ,
(7.56)
where Hk ̸= {0} and Hk ⊥Hh for every k ̸= h. (We wrote H instead of HS for the
sake of notational simplicity. This will be the convention in this section.) The rel-

7.7 Introduction to Superselection Rules
379
evance of these subspaces comes from the fact that physically admissible states in
Sp(H) are only those represented by vectors in one of the Hk. States given by linear
combinations over distinct coherent sectors are not physically permitted. Coherent
sectors are associated to collections of mutually exclusive propositions – i.e. orthog-
onal projectors Pk onto the corresponding coherent sectors, with 
k∈K Pk = I. The
sum, if inﬁnite, is meant in strong sense since K is at most countable (otherwise

k∈K Pk := ∨k∈K Pk when H is not separable, but this is not our situation). The
proposition associated to Pk corresponds to the assertion that the quantity determin-
ing the superselection rule has a certain value. More generally, the quantity will not
be required to take a speciﬁc value on each subspace, but only to range over a certain
set speciﬁed by the proposition. Let us explain this with two examples. A further
example will be given in Sect.11.2.2 and a fourth one, regarding Bargmann’s super-
selection rule, in Sect.12.3.4.
Example 7.80 (1) The ﬁrst instance is the superselection rule of the electric charge
for a charged quantum system. It prescribes that each vector ψ, determining a sys-
tem’s state, satisfy a proposition PQ of the type: “the system’s charge equals Q”
for some value Q. Mathematically, then, tr(PQ(ψ| )ψ) = 1 for some Q, which
amounts to saying PQψ = ψ for some Q (Proposition7.38). In other words: states
that are determined by single vectors and whose charge is not a deﬁnite value are
not admissible. This demand is obvious in classical physics, but not in QM, where
an electrically charged system could, a priori, admit states with indeﬁnite charge.
Asking the Hilbert space to be separable requires that the number of values Q of the
charge, i.e. the coherent sectors with given charge, be at most countable, so that the
electric charge cannot vary with continuity.11
(2) Another superselection rule concerns the angular momentum of any physical
system. From QM we know that the squared modulus J 2 of the angular momentum,
when in a deﬁnite state, can only take values j( j + 1) with j integer or semi-integer
(in ℏ=
h
2π units, where h is the usual Planck constant). The Hilbert space of the
system decomposes in two closed orthogonal subspaces, one associated to integer-
valued j, the other associated to semi-integer j. The superselection rule of the
angular momentum dictates that vectors representing states are not linear combi-
nations over both subspaces. It is important to remark that a pure state can have
an undeﬁned angular momentum, since the state/associated vector is a linear com-
bination of pure states/vectors with distinct angular momenta; by superselection,
however, these values must be either all integer or all semi-integer. We will return to
this point in Sect.12.3.2.
■
11Here we are using notions that will be introduced in Chaps.8 and 9. If the charge is taken to
be continuous and Hq is the subspace where it takes the value q ∈R, i.e. the q-eigenspace of a
self-adjoint operator Q, then the Hilbert space (non-separable) is still a sum ⊕q∈RHq, and R is the
point spectrum of Q. Some authors, instead, prefer to think of the Hilbert space as a direct integral,
thereby preserving its separability, and in this case R = σc(Q).

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
In presence of superselection rules associated to the coherent decomposition (7.56)
we can deﬁne spaces of states S(Hk) and pure states Sp(Hk) of each sector. These
can be identiﬁed with subsets in S(H) and Sp(H) respectively, by the following
obvious argument: if M is a closed subspace in H, A ∈B(M) is identiﬁed with
an operator of B(H) simply by extending it as the null operator on M⊥. If A is
positive and of trace class, the extension is positive, of trace class, and the trace is
preserved. If A is of the form (ψ| )ψ, ψ ∈M, ||ψ|| = 1, the extension is alike. In
the case considered we identify every S(Hk) and Sp(Hk) with a subset in S(H) and
Sp(H) respectively, extending each state ρ, nonpure or pure, to the zero operator on
H⊥
k . Hence S(Hk) ∩S(H j) = ∅and Sp(Hk) ∩Sp(H j) = ∅if k ̸= j. Physically
admissible pure states for the system described on H are precisely those in:
Sp(H)adm :=

k∈K
Sp(Hk) .
(7.57)
Wecallthefamilyabovethesetofadmissiblepurestatesinpresenceofsuperselection
rules. Physically-admissible nonpure states for the system described on H are then
those that can be built as mixtures of admissible pure states. Hence physically-
admissible mixed states will be convex combinations of elements of

k∈K
S(Hk) .
(7.58)
Certain physically-admissible mixed states will be ﬁnite sums

qiρi
where qi ∈(0, 1], 
i qi = 1 and ρi ∈Hki for some ki ∈K. The subtle point is that
one should also comprise inﬁnite convex combinations. For the moment we shall
stick to the ﬁnite case. Each state ρi decomposes along a basis of eigenvectors, which
belong to the corresponding coherent sector Hki, in accordance with Theorem4.20:
ρi =
+∞

j=1
pi jφi j(φi j|·)
where pi j ∈[0, 1] with 
j pi j = 1, and these numbers are arranged to guarantee
the convergence of the series in the uniform topology. Collecting the decompositions
of all states we obtain the overall expression for ρ:

7.7 Introduction to Superselection Rules

By using the strong operator topology, which does not care about the order we follow
to sum terms, we may rearrange:
ρ = s-

h∈H
phψh(ψh|·) with ψh ∈Hkh for kh ∈K
(7.59)
where ph ∈[0, 1] and 
h ph = 1. States ρ ∈S(H) of form (7.59) are supposed to
be all admitted by the superselection rule (the elements of Sp(H)adm are obviously
among them). We stress that, here, we can assume the indexing set H is countable.
It is clear that a statistical operator of the form (7.59) satisﬁes
ρPk = Pkρ
for any k ∈K,
(7.60)
where Pk is the orthogonal projector onto the coherent sector Hk. Using the spectral
theory developed in Chap.8, it is easy to establish that if ρ ∈S(H) satisﬁes (7.60)
then it is of the form (7.59). Hence equation (7.60) characterises the set of physically
admissible states completely.
Based on the discussion above we can state the ﬁrst axiom for quantum systems
with superselection rules. This, and the second axiom below, are to be understood
as constraints on A1, A2, A3.
Ss1. In presence of superselection rules in a physical system described on a separable
Hilbert space H ̸= {0}, there is a preferred, at most countable family of orthogonal
projectors {Pk}k∈K that is assumed to describe elementary propositions and satisﬁes
(i) Pk ̸= 0,
(ii) Pk ⊥Ph if h ̸= k,
(iii) s-
k Pk = I.
The pairwise-orthogonal, closed subspaces Hk := Pk(H) are called coherent sec-
tors or superselection sectors.
The only possible states of the system, called admissible states, are the elements
in:
S(H)adm := {ρ ∈S(H) | ρPk = Pkρ
for any k ∈K} .
(7.61)
The admissible pure states are therefore those in the subset Sp(H)adm of (7.57).
As one might expect,
Proposition 7.81 The subset S(H)adm is convex in S(H), and Sp(H)adm is the set
of extreme elements of S(H)adm.
Proof Evidently S(H)adm is convex, due to (7.61). The extreme elements of S(H)
are those in Sp(H) (Proposition7.34), so Sp(H) ∩S(H)adm = Sp(H)adm is made
of extreme elements of S(H)adm. If ρ ∈S(H)adm does not belong to Sp(H)adm, it
is an incoherent superposition of elements of Sp(H)adm and therefore it cannot be
extreme. □

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
Let us now look at the lattice of elementary propositions in presence of superselection
rules. Axiom A3 about post-measurement states has some remarkable implications
as soon as states are bound by Ss1. Suppose P ∈L (H) satisﬁes P Pk = Pk P for
every k ∈K, and that a measurement says it is true when the state is ρ ∈S(H)adm.
Then the post-measurement state ρP :=
PρP
tr(Pρ) still satisﬁes PkρP = ρP Pk, hence it
is admissible. As it turns out, only these propositions can be admitted, as established
by the following proposition.
Proposition 7.82 Assume that Ss1 holds. In view of axiom A3 on post-measurement
states, only certain orthogonal projectors of L (H) can be admitted as elementary
propositions on the physical system. These are the projectors P satisfying Pk P =
P Pk for every k labelling a coherent sector Hk.
Proof If ψ ∈Hk \ {0} is a pure state and we measure the pair of mutually exclusive,
compatible elementary observables P, P′ := I −P, one of them must be true. The
post-measurement state, up to renormalisation, is given by vectors Pψ or P′ψ. The
corresponding states must still belong to Sp(H)adm in view of Ss1. This requirement
implies that Pψ ∈Hr and Pψ ∈Hs for some r, s. If Pψ = 0, we automatically
think Pψ in Hk. But Hk ∋ψ = Pψ + P′ψ ∈Hr ⊕Hs. As Hk, Hr, Hs are pairwise
orthogonal if k,r, s are distinct, k = r cannot be if Pψ ̸= 0. In conclusion Pψ ∈Hk
if ψ ∈Hk (when ψ = 0 this is trivial). If φ ∈H, we can say P Pkφ ∈Hk, and so
Ph P Pkφ = δhk P Pkφ = Pk P Phφ. Using I = s- 
h Ph and the continuity of Pk P,
then Ph P Pkφ = Pk P Phφ implies P Pk = Pk P. □
Example 7.83 Referring to Example7.80(1), all elementary propositions of a phys-
ical system carrying an electric charge must commute with every projector PQ cor-
responding to the statement: “the system’s charge equals Q” for some value Q.
■
By direct inspection one easily proves that the subset L (H)adm ⊂L (H) of elements
P commuting with the projectors Pk (pairwise orthogonal and satisfying s- 
k Pk =
I) is a complete orthomodular sublattice of L (H). The Pk are clearly central in
L (H)adm, so L (H)adm cannot coincide with L (H), whose centre is just {0, I}.
If the family of projectors Pk describes all superselection rules of the system, in
each Hk all possible coherent combinations of vectors must be physically admissible.
Therefore Hk cannot admit ﬁner coherent decompositions: there is no element P in
the centre of L (H)adm such that 0 < P < Pk, making Pk an atom of the centre of
L (H)adm. The second axiom incorporates everything we have just seen.
Ss2. The set L (H)adm of elementary propositions permitted by superselection rules,
called the logic of admissible elementary propositions of the system, is a complete,
orthomodular sublattice of L (H) satisfying the following properties.
(i) The centre of L (H)adm contains the family {Pk}k∈K.
(ii) Each Pk is an atom of the centre of L (H)adm (when {Pk}k∈K describes all
superselection rules of the physical system, as we assumed).

7.7 Introduction to Superselection Rules
383
Remark 7.84 (1) The meaning of the propositions Pk is provided by physics. Some
example have been illustrated previously. A broader physical discussion on the rela-
tionship between the Pk and relevant observables deﬁning superselection rules is
undertaken in Sects.11.2.2 and 14.1.7 speciﬁcally in comparison with the so-called
algebraic approach.
(2) The description above is appropriate for the so-called discrete superselection
rules. There is another type, called continuous superselection rules, to which we will
come back in Chap.11.
■
Here is an elementary but important point. The states in S(H)adm, even if fewer than
those in S(H), are however sufﬁcient to separate admissible elementary propositions.
Proposition 7.85 Under Ss1 and Ss2, the space of admissible states separates the
lattice of admissible elementary propositions: if P, P′ ∈L (H)adm and tr(ρP) =
tr(ρP′) for every ρ ∈S(H)adm, then P = P′.
Proof If P(H) ⊂Hk and P′(H) ⊂Hh with h ̸= k, then tr(ρP) = tr(ρP′) for every
ρ ∈S(H)adm is impossible, because ρ = ψ(ψ|·) with ψ ∈P(H) and ||ψ|| = 1 sat-
isﬁes ρ ∈S(H)adm and gives tr(ρP) = 1 but tr(ρP′) = 0. If P, P′ project onto the
same sector Hk, the claim is true in view of Proposition7.30(a). □
7.7.2
An Alternate Formulation of the Theory of
Superselection Rules
Atthebeginningofthedescriptionofsuperselectionrulesweassumedthatadmissible
states are the ones in S(H)adm, which is strictly contained in S(H). Irrespective of
our previous choices of description, it is theoretically reasonable to think of the states
of the system as σ-additive probability measures on the lattice L (H)adm. Without
superselection rules, and if dim H ̸= 2, these measures correspond one-to-one, by
Gleason’s theorem, to positive trace-class operators with unit trace, namely elements
of S(H). In that case the description in terms of states (trace-class operators) is
equivalent to the description in terms of measures.
Now that the focus is on situations where superselection rules are present, we wish
toproposeananalogousalternativedescriptionofthespaceofstates.Itisbasedon two
axioms, understood as constraints on A1, A2 (measure-theory formulation) and
A3 (measure-theory version). The Hilbert space H is implicitly always separable
and non-trivial. Since we start by looking at observables instead of states, as opposed
to what we did in Ss1 and Ss2, now the ﬁrst axiom regards observables and the second
one states.
Ss1 (measure-theory formulation). The set L (H)adm of elementary propositions
permitted by superselection rules, called logic of admissible elementary propo-
sitions, is a complete, orthomodular sublattice of L (H) satisfying the following
properties.

384

The First 4 Axioms of QM: Propositions …
(i) The centre of L (H)adm contains the countable (at most) family {Pk}k∈K of
orthogonal projectors satisfying Pk ̸= 0, Pk ⊥Ph if h ̸= k, and s-
k Pk = I.
(ii) Each Pk is an atom of the centre of L (H)adm (since {Pk}k∈K is assumed to
describe all superselection rules of the physical system).
By the same argument that gave Proposition7.70(b) we have that the family {Pk}k∈K,
if it exists, is uniquely determined by those properties.
Ss2 (measure-theory formulation). In the presence of superselection rules, the
quantum states of the system are described by σ-additive probability measures on
L (H)adm. These are maps
μ : L (H)adm →[0, 1] with μ(I) = 1
(7.62)
such that

(7.63)
As we saw about admissible states, it is easy to see (but important to note) that
the σ-additive probability measures on L (H)adm are sufﬁcient to separate admissi-
ble elementary propositions. By contrast to states, however, measures representing
quantum states also satisfy the reciprocal statement.
Proposition 7.86 Under Ss1 (measure-theory formulation) and Ss2 (measure-
theory formulation):
(a) σ-additive probability measures on L (H)adm separate admissible elementary
propositions: if P, P′ ∈L (H)adm and μ(P) = μ(P′) for every σ-additive proba-
bility measure, then P = P′;
(b) the lattice L (H)adm of admissible elementary propositions separates the set
of σ-additive probability measures on L (H)adm: if μ′(P) = μ(P) for every P ∈
L (H)adm, then μ = μ′.
Proof The proof of (a) descends immediately from Proposition7.85 and the fact that
states deﬁne σ-additive probability measures on L (H) (Proposition7.25) and hence
on L (H)adm by restriction. Part (b) is true just by deﬁnition of measure. □
Theoretically speaking, the formulation relying on the notion of state in terms of
a measure is preferable to the one where states are trace-class operators. That is
because the physical objects we can really handle are just the probabilities that an
elementary proposition P is found true after measurement. The class of all those
probabilities μ(P), P ∈L (H)adm, univocally ﬁxes a (generalised) probability mea-
sure μ : L (H)adm →[0, 1]. Conversely, there could, in principle, be different states
ρ ̸= ρ′ ∈S(H)adm with tr(ρP) = tr(ρ′P) for every P ∈L (H)adm, so our deﬁni-
tion of state may be affected by redundancies. Obviously this surplus is impossible
in the absence of superselection rules, since L (H) contains all orthogonal projectors
onto one-dimensional subspaces and these are enough to separate the elements of

7.7 Introduction to Superselection Rules
385
S(H) (Proposition7.30). The next result (which uses Proposition7.70) proves that,
apart from this possible excess, the use of measures or states is essentially equivalent
when the von Neumann algebra L (H)′′
adm has certain properties.
Proposition 7.87 Let H ̸= {0} be a separable Hilbert space. Suppose that
(i) S(H)adm ⊂S(H) is deﬁned by a family, at most countable, {Pk}k∈K ⊂L (H),
with Pk ̸= 0, Ph ⊥Pk if h ̸= k and s-
k∈K Pk = I, as in (7.61);
(ii) L (H)adm ⊂L (H) is a complete orthomodular sublattice whose centre con-
tains {Pk}k∈K as atoms.
Then the following hold.
(a) If ρ ∈S(H)adm, there exists a unique σ-additive probability measure μ :
L (H)adm →[0, 1] such that tr(ρP) = μ(P) for every P ∈L (H)adm.
(b) If μ : L (H)adm →[0, 1] is a σ-additive probability measure, and L (H)′′
adm
does not contain algebras of type I2 as summands (Theorem7.68), then there exists
ρ ∈S(H)adm such that tr(ρP) = μ(P) for every P ∈L (H)adm.
(c) Suppose that either (a) or (b) hold, and ﬁx P ∈L (H)adm. Then the associ-
ated post-measurement state and measure, in accordance with A3, (7.30) and A3
(measure-theory version), (7.31), satisfy
tr(ρP Q) = μP(Q)
for every Q ∈L (H)adm.
Proof (a)Proposition7.25establishesthatμ′ : L (H) ∋P →tr(Pρ)isaσ-additive
probability measure on L (H). The map μ := μ′↾L (H)adm is therefore a σ-additive
probability measure on L (H)adm, the latter being a complete sublattice of L (H).
By construction, tr(ρP) = μ(P) for every P ∈L (H)adm.
(b) Theorem7.72 and Remark7.73 entail that there is a state ρ0 ∈S(H) with
tr(ρ0P) = μ(P) for every P ∈L (H)adm. We claim that there also exists ρ ∈
S(H)adm with the same property. If ψ ∈H, deﬁne ρψ := 
k∈K Pkρ0Pkψ. The
series converges as {Pkρ0Pkψ}k∈K
is a system of orthogonal vectors and

so that ρ = |ρ|. Moreover Pkρ = ρPk for every k ∈K just by construction. Let us

then {ψ(k)

Thus far we have established ρ ∈S(H)adm. To conclude, observe that, if P ∈
L (H)adm then Pρψ(k)
jk = P Pkρ0Pkψ(k)
jk = Pk Pρ0ψ(k)
jk , and consequently

as wanted.
(c) This claim immediately follows from the deﬁnitions of μP and ρP, using P QP ∈
L (H)adm. □
There remains the issue about whether there exist pairs of distinct elements ρ, ρ′ ∈
S(H)adm determining the same σ-additive probability measure μ : L (H)adm →
[0, 1], in the sense that tr(ρP) = tr(ρ′P) =: μ(P) for every P ∈L (H)adm. Equiv-
alently, whether or not L (H)adm separates S(H)adm.
The following statement provides sufﬁcient conditions.
Proposition 7.88 Assume the hypotheses (i) and (ii) of Proposition7.87. Suppose,
further, that
L (H)adm ⊃L (Hk) with Hk := Pk(H) for every k ∈K,
(7.64)
where elements in L (Hk) are viewed as elements in L (H) by extending them trivially
(as zero) on H⊥
k . The following facts hold.
(a) L (H)adm separates the elements of S(H)adm: if ρ, ρ′ ∈S(H)adm satisfy
tr(Pρ) = tr(Pρ′) for every P ∈L (H)adm
then ρ = ρ′.
(b) Under the hypotheses of Proposition7.87(b), for every σ-additive probability
measure μ : L (H)adm →[0, 1] there is exactly one ρ ∈S(H)adm such that μ(P) =
tr(ρP) for all P ∈L (H)adm.
Proof Obviously (a) implies (b), so it is sufﬁcient to prove (a). Suppose ρ, ρ′ ∈
S(H)adm satisfytr(ρQ) = tr(ρ′Q)forevery Q ∈L (H)adm.Since Q canbedecom-
posed as Q = 

then ρ −ρ′ = ⊕hρh −ρ′
h = 0. □
Remark 7.89 (1)ConcerningvonNeumannalgebrasofobservables(Proposition7.71),
in
Sect.11.2.2 we shall discuss sufﬁcient conditions to guarantee the validity of (7.64).
However,ingeneral(7.64)failsandthereexistmanystates ρ ∈S(H)adm correspond-
ing to a given measure μ : L (H)adm →[0, 1]. The logic of admissible elementary
propositions is not able to separate states, as opposed to probability measures. This
fact suggests that the notion of quantum state, in the presence of superselection rules,
is better described by σ-additive measures on the lattice of admissible elementary
propositions rather than trace-class operators and vectors. Besides, we have already
hinted at operators being in excess to describe the quantum features of a quantum
system.
(2) Sometimes, in presence of superselection rules, no constraint the states is assumed
and every ρ ∈S(H) is supposed admissible, though the lattice of elementary propo-
sitions is restricted to L (H)adm. With this third formulation the redundancy becomes
huge, due to the profusion of states that determine the same probability measure on
L (H)adm, and hence carry exactly the same physical information. The following
instructive example elucidates that the difference between coherent and incoherent
superposition becomes unsustainable within this picture. Take
ρ :=

Ψ :=

for any choice of ck ∈R. We claim ρ and Ψ give rise to the same σ-additive proba-
bility measure on L (H)adm. Indeed, if Q ∈L (H)adm, we deﬁne ρ′ := Ψ (Ψ |·) and
complete both Ψ and {ψk}k∈K to separate Hilbert bases of H. Then

In general Ψ (Ψ |·) will not belong in S(H)adm, because it is a coherent superposition
of pure states of different sectors as soon as pk > 0 for at least two values of k.
The picture can be made even more general by allowing for more than one vector
in each coherent sector Hk. This is yet another bit of suggesting evidence that – in
the presence of superselection rules – the notion of quantum state is better portrayed
by σ-additive measures on admissible elementary propositions than by trace-class
operators and vectors.

7.2 Prove that every orthocomplemented lattice X satisﬁes De Morgan’s laws (7.6).
Then prove Proposition7.11:
Proposition. Let X be an orthocomplemented lattice. The following facts hold for
any subset A ⊂X.
(a) If A is ﬁnite, then ¬ supa∈A a = infa∈A ¬a ,
¬ infa∈A a = supa∈A ¬a.
(b) If A is inﬁnite, then supa∈A a (infa∈A a) exists if and only if infa∈A ¬a (supa∈A ¬a)

in the deﬁnition of orthocomplemented lattice.
7.3 Show that an orthocomplemented lattice is complete (σ-complete) iff every set
(resp. countable set) A ⊂X admits greatest lower bound.
Hint. Exploit Exercise7.2.
7.4 Prove Proposition7.15:
Proposition. Let h : X →Y be an isomorphism of orthocomplemented lattices. If
both X and Y are (σ-)complete, then h is an isomorphism of (σ-)complete lattices.
Solution. We only consider complete lattices, for the other case is similar. We
have to prove that if A ⊂X then h(sup A) = sup h(A) and h(inf A) = inf h(A).
Remark7.9(4) permits us to prove the former relation only. Since a ≤sup A for

Exercises
389
every a ∈A and h preserves the ordering (Remark7.14(1)), then h(a) ≤h(sup A)
so that (i) sup h(A) ≤h(sup A). Since h(a) ≤sup h(A) for a ∈A, applying the
isomorphism of orthocomplemented lattices h−1 (it preserves the order), we get
a ≤h−1(sup h(A)) so that sup A ≤h−1(sup h(A)). Applying h, we conclude (ii)
h(sup A) ≤sup h(A). Now (i) and (ii) together imply h(sup A) = sup h(A).
7.5 Let (X, ≥) be atomic and orthomodular. Prove that if p ∈X is not an atom, then
Ap := {a ≤p | ais an atom} contains more than one atom.
Solution. Since (X, ≥) is atomic, there exists a ∈Ap. Then observe that ortho-
modularity implies p = a ∨(¬a ∧p) and hence either ¬a ∧p = 0 (and p = a)
or ¬a ∧p ̸= 0. The second case is only possible when p ̸= a. Next, atomicity
implies that ¬a ∧p ≥a′ for some atom a′. Moreover, a′ ̸= a because otherwise
a′ ≤¬a and a′ ≤¬a′ would imply a′ = 0, and atoms cannot be zero. Since then
a′ ≤(¬a ∧p ≤) p, we conclude that Ap ∋a′ ̸= a.
7.6 Prove that an orthomodular lattice (X, ≥) is atomistic iff atomic.
Solution. The only thing that needs to be proved is that ‘atomicity ⇒atomisticity’.
Consider p ∈X and Ap := {a ≤p | ais an atom}. Suppose that there exists q ̸= p
such that a ≤q ≤p if a ∈Ap. Orthomodularity requires p = q ∨(¬q ∧p), and so
¬q ∧p ̸= 0 because p ̸= q. Since X is atomic, there is an atom a′ ≤¬q ∧p, so in
particular a′ ≤¬q and also a′ ≤p. Hence a′ ∈Ap and, in turn, a′ ≤q. Therefore
a′ ≤q ∧¬q = 0, which is forbidden because a′ is an atom. In summary, the element
q cannot exist, and p is the smallest element satisfying a ≤p if a ∈Ap, namely
p = sup Ap. This shows X is atomistic.
7.7 Prove Proposition7.10:
Proposition. If X is an orthocomplemented lattice, then p, q ∈X commute if and
only if the orthocomplemented lattice generated by {p, q} (the intersection of all
bounded orthocomplemented sublattices containing {p, q}) is Boolean.
Solution. Suppose the intersection of all (orthocomplemented) sublattices con-
taining {p, q} is Boolean. Then r1 := p ∨¬q, r2 := q ∨¬p, r3 := p ∧q are con-
tained in that Boolean lattice and hence satisfy ri ⊥r j if i ̸= j, p = r1 ∨r3, and
q = r2 ∨r3. Assume, conversely, p1 and p2 commute so that p = r1 ∨r2 and
q = r2 ∨r3 with ri ⊥r j if i ̸= j. A sublattice X0 containing p and q is made of
the following elements: 0, r1, r2, r3, r4 := ¬(r1 ∨r2 ∨r3), all possible two-fold,
three-fold and four-fold joins of them (1 is one of these). It is easy to prove that X0
is Boolean. Every sublattice containing p and q necessarily contains r1,r2,r3, and
so it also contains X0. In summary, X0 is the intersection of all (orthocomplemented)
sublattices containing {p, q}.

7.15 Prove that two mixed states ρ1, ρ2 on the Hilbert space H satisfy Ran(ρ1) ⊥
Ran(ρ2) iff there exists an orthogonal projector P ∈L (H) with tr(ρ1P) = 1,
tr(ρ2P) = 0.
Solution. If Ran(ρ1) ⊥Ran(ρ2), the orthogonal projector onto Ran(ρ1) solves
the problem. Conversely, if tr(ρ1P) = 1 and tr(ρ2P) = 0 for some P ∈L (H), let
P′ := I−P. Then 1=tr(ρ1)=tr(Pρ1P) + tr(P′ρ1P′) + tr(P′ρ1P) + tr(Pρ1P′).
But
tr(Pρ1P) = tr(ρ1P) = 1,
tr(P′ρ1P) = tr(ρ1P P′) = 0,
tr(Pρ1P′) =
tr(ρ1P′P) = 0, and therefore tr(P′ρ1P′) = 0. Since P′ρ1P′ is positive, self-adjoint
and of trace class, and the trace equals the sum of the eigenvalues, the latter all van-
ish. By the spectral decomposition Theorem4.20 we have P′ρ1P′ = 0, so ρ1 =
Pρ1P + P′ρ1P + Pρ1P′. From this identity we easily see that Pρ1P′ ̸= 0 implies
(x + ay|ρ1(x + ay)) < 0 for some x ∈P(H), y ∈P′(H), with a ∈R or a ∈iR of
sufﬁciently large modulus. Hence Pρ1P′ = P′ρ1P = 0 and ρ1 = Pρ1(P + P′) =
Pρ1, and then Ran(ρ1) ⊂P(H). A similar reasoning gives P′ρ2P = Pρ2P′ = 0,
whence ρ2 = P′ρ2(P + P′) = P′ρ2. This implies Ran(ρ2) ⊂P′(H), and therefore
Ran(ρ1) ⊥Ran(ρ2).

C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
A mathematician plays a game and invents the rules. A physicist
plays a game whose rules are dictated by Nature. As time goes
by it is more and more evident that the rules the mathematician
ﬁnds appealing are precisely the ones Nature has chosen.
P.A.M. Dirac
In this purely mathematically-ﬂavoured chapter we introduce the basic spectral the-
ory on normed spaces, leading up to spectral measures and the spectral decomposition
theorem for normal operators in B(H), with H a Hilbert space. (The spectral the-
orem for unbounded self-adjoint operators will be discussed in the next chapter.)
Here we present a number of general results about abstract C∗-algebras and ∗-
homomorphisms.
The ﬁrst part is devoted to the resolvent set and spectrum of an operator, or an
element in a Banach algebra with unit. Given a normal element in a unital C∗-
algebra, possibly a normal operator in a concrete algebra of bounded operators on a
Hilbert space, we shall prove there exists a ∗-homomorphism mapping continuous
functions deﬁned on a compact subset in C (the spectrum of the element) to algebra
elements, i.e. operators. In case we are dealing with operators we will show that
this ∗-homomorphism extends to the C∗-algebra of bounded measurable functions
deﬁned on the compact set.
The spectrum of an operator is a collection of complex numbers that generalise
eigenvalues. The spectral theorem, proved afterwards, decomposes any operator – in
this chapter always bounded and normal – by integrating the spectrum with respect
to a suitable “projector-valued” measure. Altogether, the spectral theorem may be
viewed as a generalisation to Hilbert spaces of the diagonalisation of complex-valued
normal matrices. The tools necessary to establish the spectral theorem are useful
also for other reasons. Through them, namely, we will be able to deﬁne “operators
depending on operators”, a notion with several applications in mathematical physics.

Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
The relationship between spectral theory and Quantum Mechanics lies in the fact
that projector-valued measures are nothing but the observables deﬁned in the previous
chapter. Via the spectral theorem, observables are in one-to-one correspondence with
self-adjoint operators (typically unbounded), and the latter’s spectra are the sets of
possible measurements of observables. The correspondence observables/self-adjoint
operators will allow us to formulate Quantum Theory in tight connection to Classical
Mechanics, where the observables are the physical quantities represented by real
functions. Let us present the contents in detail.
In section one we will deﬁne the spectrum, the resolvent set and the resolvent
operator, establish their main properties and discuss the formula for the spectral
radius. All this will be generalised to abstract Banach algebras or C∗-algebras, and
include the proof of the Gelfand–Mazur theorem and a brief overview of the major
featuresofC∗-algebrarepresentations.WeshallstatetheimportantGelfand-Najmark
theorem, whereby any unital C∗-algebra is a concrete C∗-algebra of operators on a
Hilbert space. The proof will be given in Chap.14, after the GNS theorem.
In section two we shall construct continuous ∗-homomorphisms of C∗-algebras
of functions, induced either by normal elements in an abstract C∗-algebra or by
bounded self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces. These homomorphisms represent
the primary tool towards the spectral theorem. We will discuss the general properties
of ∗-homomorphisms of unital C∗-algebras and positive elements of C∗-algebras.
Then we will introduce the Gelfand transform to study commutative C∗-algebras
with unit, and prove the commutative Gelfand-Najmark theorem.
In the third section we shall introduce spectral measures, also known as projector-
valued measures (PVMs), and deﬁne the integral of a bounded function with respect
to a PVM.
The spectral theorem for normal bounded operators (in particular self-adjoint or
unitary) and further technical facts will be dealt with in Sect.8.4.
The ﬁnal section is devoted to Fuglede’s theorem and some consequences.
8.1
Spectrum, Resolvent Set and Resolvent Operator
In this section we study the structural concepts and results of spectral theory in
normed, Banach and Hilbert spaces, but also in the more general context of Banach
and C∗-algebras.
We shall make use of analytic functions deﬁned on domains in C with values in
a complex Banach space [Rud86], rather than in C.
Deﬁnition 8.1 Let (X, || ||) be a Banach space over C and Ω ⊂C a non-empty
open set. A function f : Ω →X is called analytic if for any z0 ∈Ω there exists
δ > 0 such that
f (z) =

for any z ∈Bδ(z0),
where Bδ(z0) ⊂Ω, an ∈X for any n ∈N and the series converges in norm || ||.

8.1 Spectrum, Resolvent Set and Resolvent Operator
395
The theory of analytic functions in Banach spaces is essentially the same as that of
complex-valued analytic functions, which we take for granted; the only difference is
that on the range the Banach norm replaces the modulus of complex numbers. With
this proviso, all deﬁnitions, theorems and proofs are the same as in the holomorphic
case.
8.1.1
Basic Notions in Normed Spaces
We begin with operators on normed spaces, and recall that if X is a vector space, the
sentence “A is a operator on X” (Deﬁnition 5.1) means A : D(A) →X, where the
domain D(A) ⊂X is a subspace, usually not closed, in X.
Deﬁnition 8.2 Let A be an operator on the complex normed space X.
(a) One calls resolvent set of A the set ρ(A) of numbers λ ∈C such that:
(i) Ran(A −λI) = X;
(ii) (A −λI) : D(A) →X is injective;
(iii) (A −λI)−1 : Ran(A −λI) →X is bounded.
(b) If λ ∈ρ(A), the resolvent of A is the operator
Rλ(A) := (A −λI)−1 : Ran(A −λI) →D(A) .
(c) The spectrum of A is the set σ(A) := C \ ρ(A).
The spectrum of A is the disjoint union of the three subsets below:
(i) the point spectrum σp(A), made by the λ ∈C for which A −λI is not
injective;
(ii) the continuous spectrum σc(A), made by the λ ∈C such that A −λI is
injective and Ran(A −λI) = X, but (A −λI)−1 is not bounded;
(iii) the residual spectrum σr(A), made by the λ ∈C for which A −λI is
injective, but Ran(A −λI) ̸= X.
Remarks 8.3 (1) It is clear that σp(A) consists precisely of the eigenvalues of A (see
Deﬁnition 3.58). In case X = H is a Hilbert space and the eigenvectors of A form
a basis in H one says A has purely point spectrum. This does not mean, gener-
ally speaking, that σp(T ) = σ(T ). For example compact self-adjoint operators have
purely point spectrum, but 0 may belong to the continuous spectrum.
(2) There exist other decompositions of the spectrum in the case that X = H is a
Hilbert space and A is normal in B(H), or self-adjoint on H. We shall consider alter-
native splittings in the following chapter, after the spectral theorem for unbounded
self-adjoint operators. An in-depth analysis of these classiﬁcations, with reference
to important operators in QM, can be found in [ReSi80, BiSo87, AbCi97, BEH07,
Schm12].
■
We start making a few precise assumptions, like taking X Banach and working with
closed operators. In particular, the next result holds if T ∈B(X) or, on a Hilbert

Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
space X = H, if T : D(T ) →H is self-adjoint or an adjoint operator on H, since
both are automatically closed.
Theorem 8.4 Let T be a closed operator on a Banach space X ̸= {0}. Then
(a) λ ∈ρ(T ) ⇔T −λI : D(T ) →X is a bijection.
(b) (i) ρ(T ) is open,
(ii) σ(T ) is closed,
(iii) if ρ(T ) ̸= ∅, the map ρ(T ) ∋λ →Rλ(T ) ∈B(X) is analytic.
(c) If D(T ) = X (hence T ∈B(X)):
(i) ρ(T ) ̸= ∅,
(ii) σ(T ) is non-empty and compact,
(iii) |λ| ≤||T|| for any λ ∈σ(T ).
(d) For any λ, μ ∈ρ(T ) the resolvent identity holds:
Rλ(T ) −Rμ(T ) = (λ −μ)Rλ(T )Rμ(T ) .
Remarks 8.5 (1) A comment on (c): if X is a Banach space and D(T ) = X, then
T : D(T ) →X is closed iff T ∈B(X), by the closed graph Theorem2.99.
(2) Part (a) is rather useful for deciding whether λ belongs in ρ(T ). It is not necessary
to consider the topology, i.e. the density of Ran(T −λI) and the boundedness of
(T −λI)−1. As a matter of fact, it is enough to check T −λI : D(T ) →X is
bijective, a set-theoretical property.
■
Proof of Theorem 8.4. (a) If λ ∈ρ(T ), it sufﬁces to show Ran(T −λI) = X. Since
(T −λI)−1 is continuous, there exists K ≥0 such that ||(T −λI)−1x|| ≤K||x||
for any x = (T −λI)y ∈Ran(T −λI). Consequently, for any y ∈D(T):
||y|| ≤K||(T −λI)y|| .
(8.1)
Because Ran(T −λI) = X, if x ∈X there is a sequence {yn}n∈N ⊂D(T ) for
which (T −λI)yn →x, as n →+∞. From (8.1) we conclude {yn}n∈N is a Cauchy
sequence and so it admits a limit y ∈X. As T is a closed operator, y ∈D(T ) and
(T −λI)y = x, hence x ∈Ran(T −λI). Therefore Ran(T −λI) = X, as claimed.
Suppose now T −λI is a bijection from D(T ) to X; to prove the claim we need
to show (T −λI)−1 is continuous. Since T is closed, then also T −λI is closed, i.e.
its graph is closed. But T −λI is a bijection, so (T −λI)−1 has a closed graph and
is therefore closed. Being (T −λI)−1 deﬁned on X by assumption, Theorem2.99
implies (T −λI)−1 is bounded.
(b) If μ ∈ρ(T ), the series
S(λ) :=
+∞

n=0
(λ −μ)n Rμ(T )n+1

8.1 Spectrum, Resolvent Set and Resolvent Operator

converges absolutely in operator norm (hence in the uniform topology) provided
|λ −μ| < 1/||Rμ(T )|| .
(8.2)
In fact,

n=0
|λ −μ|n||Rμ(T )n+1|| ≤

n=0
|λ −μ|n||Rμ(T )||n+1 = ||Rμ(T )||

n=0
| (λ −μ) ||Rμ(T )|| |n .
The last series is geometric, of reason | (λ −μ) ||Rμ(T )|| |, and converges because
| (λ −μ) ||Rμ(T )|| | < 1 by (8.2).
If λ satisﬁes the above condition, applying T −λI = (T −μI) + (μ −λ)I ﬁrst
to the left, and then to right of S(λ) gives (again using the deﬁnition Rμ(T )0 := I):
(T −λI)S(λ) = IX
while:
S(λ)(T −λI) = ID(T ) .
Hence if μ ∈ρ(T ) there exists an open neighbourhood of μ such that, for any λ in
that neighbourhood, the left and right inverses of T −λI, from X to D(T ), exist and
are ﬁnite. By (a) then, the neighbourhood is contained in ρ(T ), and so ρ(T ) is open
and σ(T ) = C \ ρ(T ) closed. Moreover Rλ(T ) has a Taylor series around any point
of ρ(T ) in the uniform topology, so by deﬁnition ρ(T ) ∋λ →Rλ(T ) is analytic
and maps ρ(T ) to the Banach space B(X).
(c) In case D(T ) = X, since T is closed and X Banach, the closed graph theorem
makes T bounded. If λ ∈C satisﬁes |λ| > ||T ||, the series
S(λ) =
+∞

n=0
(−λ)−(n+1)T n
(T 0 := I), converges absolutely in operator norm. A direct computation, as before,
gives the identities
(T −λI)S(λ) = I
and
S(λ)(T −λI) = I ,
hence S(λ) = Rλ(T ) by (a). Again (a) implies that every λ ∈C with |λ| > ||T||
belongs to ρ(T ), which is thus non-empty. Furthermore, if λ ∈σ(T ), |λ| ≤||T||,
and σ(T ) will be compact if it is non-empty, being closed and bounded. Let us show
σ(T ) ̸= ∅. Assume the contrary and argue by contradiction. Then λ →Rλ(T ) is
deﬁned on C. Fix f ∈X′ (dual to X) and x ∈X, and consider the complex-valued
function ρ(T ) ∋λ →g(λ) := f (Rλ(T )x). It is certainly analytic on C, because if

398
8
Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
μ ∈ρ(T ), on a neighbourhood of μ contained in ρ(T ) we have a Taylor expansion
f (Rλ(T )x) :=
+∞

n=0
(λ −μ)n f (Rμ(T )n+1x) .
We have used the continuity of the linear functional f , and the fact the series con-
verges uniformly (and so weakly). Hence assuming σ(T ) = ∅, g is analytic on C.
We notice that for |λ| > ||T || we have
g(λ) := f (Rλ(T )x) =
+∞

n=0
(−λ)−(n+1) f (T nx) .
This series converges absolutely (by Abel’s theorem on power series), so we can
write, for |λ| ≥1 + ||T ||:

with K > 0. Thus |g|, everywhere continuous and bounded from above by K|λ−1|,
when |λ| ≥ for some constant , must be bounded on the entire complex plane.
Being analytic on C, g is constant by Liouville’s theorem. As |g(λ)| vanishes at
inﬁnity, g is the null map. Then f (Rλ(T )x) = 0. But the result holds for any f ∈X′,
so Corollary2.56 to Hahn–Banach (where X ̸= {0}), implies ||Rλ(T )x|| = 0. As
x ∈X ̸= {0} was arbitrary, we have to conclude Rλ(T ) = 0 for any λ ∈ρ(T ).
Therefore Rλ(T )cannotinvert T −λI,andthecontradictiondisprovestheassumption
σ(T ) = ∅.
(d) The resolvent identity is proved as follows. First, we have
(T −λI)Rλ(T ) = I
and (T −μI)Rμ(T ) = I .
Consider T Rλ(T ) −λRλ(T ) = IX and T Rμ(T ) −μRμ(T ) = IX, multiply the ﬁrst
by Rμ(T ) on the left and the second by Rλ(T ) on the right, and then subtract them.
Recalling Rμ(T )Rλ(T ) = Rλ(T )Rμ(T ) and Rμ(T )T Rλ(T ) = Rλ(T )T Rμ(T ), we
obtain the resolvent equation. The ﬁrst commutation relation used above follows
from the evident fact
(T −μI)(T −λI) = (T −λI)(T −μI),
which also gives a similar equation for inverses. The other relation is explained as
follows:

8.1 Spectrum, Resolvent Set and Resolvent Operator
399
Rμ(T)T Rλ(T ) = Rμ(T )(T −λI)Rλ(T ) + Rμ(T )λI Rλ(T ) = Rμ(T )I + λRμ(T )Rλ(T )
= Rμ(T) + λRλ(T )Rμ(T ) = (I + λRλ(T))Rμ(T ) = (Rλ(T )(T −λI) + λRλ(T ))Rμ(T )
= Rλ(T)T Rμ(T ) .
This ends the proof. □
A useful corollary is worth citing that descends immediately from the resolvent
identity and (a), (b) in Proposition 4.9.
Corollary 8.6 Let T : D(T ) →X be a closed operator on the Banach space X. If
for one μ ∈ρ(T ) the resolvent Rμ(T ) is compact, then Rλ(T ) is compact for any
λ ∈ρ(T).
8.1.2
The Spectrum of Special Classes of Normal Operators
on Hilbert Spaces
Let us focus on unitary operators and self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces, and
discuss the structure of their spectrum. Using Deﬁnition 8.2 we shall work in full
generality and consider unbounded operators with non-maximal domains.
Proposition 8.7 Let H be a Hilbert space.
(a) If A is self-adjoint on H (but not necessarily bounded, nor deﬁned on the whole
H in general):
(i) σ(A) ⊂R,
(ii) σr(A) = ∅,
(iii) the eigenspaces of A with distinct eigenvalues (points in σp(A)) are orthog-
onal.1
(b) If U ∈B(H) is unitary:
(i) σ(U) is a non-empty compact subset of {λ ∈C | |λ| = 1},
(ii) σr(U) = ∅.
(c) If T ∈B(H) is normal:
(i) σr(T ) = σr(T ∗) = ∅,
(ii) σp(T ∗) = σp(T ),
(iii) σc(T ∗) = σc(T ), where the bar denotes complex conjugation.
Proof (a) Let us begin with (i). Suppose λ = μ + iν, ν ̸= 0 and let us prove
λ ∈ρ(A). If x ∈D(A),
((A−λI)x|(A−λI)x) = ((A−μI)x|(A−μI)x)+ν2(x|x)+iν[(Ax|x)−(x|Ax)].
1The analogous property for normal operators (hence unitary or self-adjoint too) in B(H) is con-
tained in Proposition 3.60(b).

Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
The last summand vanishes for A is self-adjoint. Hence
||(A −λI)x|| ≥|ν| ||x|| .
With a similar argument we obtain
||(A −λI)x|| ≥|ν| ||x|| .
The operators A −λI and A −λI are then one-to-one, and ||(A −λI)−1|| ≤|ν|−1,
where (A −λI)−1 : Ran(A −λI) →D(A). Notice
Ran(A −λI)
⊥= [Ran(A −λI)]⊥= Ker(A∗−λI) = Ker(A −λI) = {0} ,
where the last equality makes use of the injectivity of A −λI. Summarising: A −λI
in injective, (A −λI)−1 bounded and Ran(A −λI)
⊥= {0}, i.e. Ran(A −λI) is
dense in H. Therefore λ ∈ρ(A), by deﬁnition of resolvent set.
Now to (ii). Suppose λ ∈σ(A), but λ /∈σp(A). Then A −λI must be one-to-one
and Ker(A −λI) = {0}. Since A = A∗and λ ∈R by (i), we have Ker(A∗−
λI) = {0}, so [Ran(A −λI)]⊥= Ker(A∗−λI) = {0} and Ran(A −λI) = H.
Consequently λ ∈σc(A).
Proving (iii) is easy: if λ ̸= μ and Au = λu, Av = μv, then
(λ −μ)(u|v) = (Au|v) −(u|Av) = (u|Av) −(u|Av) = 0 ;
from λ, μ ∈R and A = A∗. But λ −μ ̸= 0, so (u|v) = 0.
(b) (i) The closure of σ(U) is a consequence of Theorem8.4(b), because any unitary
operator is deﬁned on H, bounded and so closed. As ||U|| = 1, part (c) of that
theorem implies σ(U) is a compact non-empty subset in {λ ∈C | |λ| ≤1}. To
ﬁnish, consider the series
S(λ) =
+∞

n=0
λn(U ∗)n+1
with |λ| < 1. Since ||U|| = ||U ∗|| = 1, the series converges absolutely in operator
norm, so it deﬁnes an operator in B(H). Because U ∗U = UU ∗= I,
(U −λI)S(λ) = S(λ)(U −λI) = I .
By Theorem8.4(a) λ ∈ρ(U). To sum up: σ(U) is compact and non-empty inside
{λ ∈C | |λ| = 1}.
(ii) This follows from part (i) of (c), because every unitary operator is normal.
(c) Recall that T ∈B(H) normal implies λ ∈C is an eigenvalue iff λ is an eigenvalue
of T ∗((i) in Proposition 3.60(b)). This is enough to give (ii). The three parts of the
spectrum are disjoint, and σ(T ) = σ(T ∗) (by Proposition 8.14(b), whose proof is
independent from this theorem), so to prove (iii) it is enough to show (i). Assume

8.1 Spectrum, Resolvent Set and Resolvent Operator
401
λ ∈σ(T), but λ /∈σp(T ).Since σ(T ) = σ(T ∗)andσp(T ) = σp(T ∗),thehypothesis
is equivalent to λ ∈σ(T ∗), but λ /∈σp(T ∗). Then T ∗−λI must be one-to-one and
Ker(T ∗−λI) = {0}. Now Proposition 3.38(d) tells [Ran(T −λI)]⊥= Ker(T ∗−
λI) = {0}, hence Ran(T −λI) = H (here the bar denotes the closure). Therefore
λ ∈σc(T ), i.e. σr(T ) = ∅. The proof for T ∗is the same, because (T ∗)∗= T
(Proposition 3.38(b)). ⊓⊔

Spectral Radius, Gelfand’s Formula, Gelfand–Najmark
Theorem
Now we consider, more abstractly, unital Banach algebras and unital C∗-algebras
(Deﬁnitions 2.24 and 3.40). Recall that B(X) is a unital Banach algebra if X is
normed, by (i) in Theorem2.44(c). If H is a Hilbert space, B(H) is a unital C∗-
algebra whose involution is the Hermitian conjugation, by Theorem3.49.
First of all we generalise the notions of resolvent set and spectrum to an abstract
setting. We shall use B(X) as model, with X Banach, so to have Theorem8.4 at work.
Recall that in an algebra A with unit I the inverse a−1 to a ∈A is the unique element,
if present, such that a−1a = aa−1 = I.
Deﬁnition 8.8 Let A be a Banach algebra with unit I and take a ∈A.
(a) The resolvent set of a is the set:
ρ(a) := {λ ∈C | ∃(a −λI)−1 ∈A} .
(b) The spectrum of a is the complement σ(a) := C \ ρ(a).
The following fact generalises the assertion in Theorem8.4 about operators of B(X).
Theorem 8.9 Let A ̸= {0} be a Banach algebra with unit I, a ∈A an arbitrary
element.
(a) ρ(a) ̸= ∅is open, σ(a) ̸= ∅is compact and:
|λ| ≤||a|| ,
for any λ ∈σ(a).
(b) The map ρ(a) ∋λ →Rλ(a) := (a −λI)−1 ∈A is analytic.
(c) If λ, μ ∈ρ(a) the resolvent identity holds:
Rλ(a) −Rμ(a) = (λ −μ)Rλ(a)Rμ(a) .
Proof The argument is the same as for properties (b), (c), (d) of Theorem8.4, because
of Remark8.5(1): just replace, in the proof of (c), f (Rλ(T )x) by f (Rλ(a)), where
f ∈A′ (Banach dual to A). ⊓⊔

A straightforward, yet important corollary is the Gelfand–Mazur theorem, whereby
every complex, normed division algebra is isomorphic to C, so in particular is com-
mutative.
Theorem 8.10 (Gelfand–Mazur) A complex Banach algebra B ̸= {0} with unit, in
which every non-zero element is invertible, is naturally isomorphic to C. (In partic-
ular B is commutative.)
Proof Take x ∈B, so σ(x) ̸= ∅by part (a) in the previous theorem. Then x −cI
is not invertible for some c ∈C by deﬁnition of spectrum. In our case x −cI = 0,
so x = cI. But c is completely determined by x, for cI ̸= c′I if c ̸= c′. The map
B ∋x →c ∈C is a Banach algebra isomorphism, as is easy to see.
⊓⊔
Remark 8.11 The assumption that the ﬁeld is C is crucial. There exist Banach divi-
sion algebras that are not commutative, like the algebra H of quaternions introduced
in Example3.48(3). The latter, though, is a real algebra.
■
According to Theorem8.9(a), the spectrum of a ∈A is contained in the disc of
radius ||a|| centred at the origin of C. Yet there might be a disc of smaller radius at
the origin enclosing σ(a). In this respect we have the next deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 8.12 Let A be a Banach algebra with unit. The spectral radius of a ∈A
is the non-negative real number
r(a) := sup{|λ| | λ ∈σ(a)} .
This applies in particular when A = B(X), X a Banach space.
Remark 8.13 Any element a in a unital Banach algebra A satisﬁes the elementary
(yet fundamental) property:
0 ≤r(a) ≤||a|| ,
(8.3)
immediately ensuing from Theorem8.9(a).
■
There exists an explicit expression for the spectral radius, due to the mathematician
I.Gelfand. We shall recover Gelfand’s formula using a property of the spectrum of
polynomials over A.
Proposition 8.14 Let A be a Banach algebra with unit I, a ∈A and p = p(z) a
complex-valued polynomial in the variable z ∈C.
(a) Let p(a) be the element in A obtained by formally substituting the element a to
z in p(z) and interpreting powers an in the obvious way (a0 := I); then
σ(p(a)) = p(σ(a)) := {p(λ) | λ ∈σ(a)} .
(8.4)
(This holds in particular for A = B(X), X Banach.)

8.1 Spectrum, Resolvent Set and Resolvent Operator
403
(b) If A is additionally a ∗-algebra, the spectrum of a∗satisﬁes
σ(a∗) = σ(a) := {λ | λ ∈σ(a)} .
(8.5)
(This holds in particular for A = B(H) with H a Hilbert space.)
Proof (a) If α1, . . . , αn denote the roots of a polynomial q (not necessarily distinct),
q(z) = c n
i=1(z −αi) for some complex number c. Hence q(a) = c n
i=1(a −αiI).
Let λ ∈σ(a), so (a −λI) is not invertible by deﬁnition. Set μ := p(λ). Consider
now the polynomial q := p−μ. As q(λ) = 0, one factor in the above decomposition
of q will be (z −λ), and so choosing the root order appropriately, and recalling that
the a −αiI commute, we have:
p(a) −μI = c
n−1

i=1
(a −αiI)

(a −λI) = c(a −λI)
n−1

i=1
(a −αiI) .
Thus p(a) −μI cannot be invertible, for a −λI is not. (If p(a) −μI were invertible,
we would have
I = (a −λI)
	n−1

i=1
c(a −αiI)

(p(a) −μI)−1

,
I =
	
(p(a) −μI)−1
n−1

i=1
c(a −αiI)

(a −λI) ,
implying (a −λI) invertible. Applying the big bracket to the ﬁrst equation would
say that the right and left inverses of (a −λI) coincide:
(p(a) −μI)−1
n−1

i=1
c(a −αiI) =
	n−1

i=1
c(a −αiI)

(p(a) −μI)−1 ,
as it should be.) By deﬁnition we must have μ ∈σ(p(a)), hence we proved
p(σ(a)) ⊂σ(p(a)). Now we go for the other inclusion. Let μ ∈σ(p(a)), set
q = p −μ and factor q(z) = c n
i=1(z −αi). Therefore
p(a) −μI = c
n
i=1
(a −αiI)
as before. If all roots αi belonged to ρ(a), every (a −αiI) : X →X would be
invertible, so p(a) −μI would become invertible, which is excluded by assumption.
Therefore there is a root αk such that (a −αkI) is not invertible, so αk ∈σ(a). But
then p(αk) −μ = 0, so μ ∈p(σ(a)), and hence p(σ(a)) ⊃σ(p(a)).

(b) (a −λI) is invertible if and only if (a −λI)∗= a∗−λI by Proposition 3.44(c),
hence the claim. ⊓⊔
Theorem 8.15 Let A be a Banach algebra with unit and a ∈A.
(a) The spectral radius of a can be computed by Gelfand’s formula:
r(a) =
lim
n→+∞||an||1/n ,
where the limit always exists. (This holds in particular when A = B(X) with X
Banach.)
(b) If A is a C∗-algebra with unit and a is normal (a∗a = aa∗), then
r(a) = ||a|| ,
(8.6)
and consequently:
||a|| = r(a∗a)1/2 for any a ∈A.
(8.7)
(Valid in particular for A = B(H), H Hilbert.)
Proof (a) By Proposition 8.14(a) (σ(a))n = σ(an), so r(a)n = r(an) ≤||an||, and
then
r(a) ≤lim inf
n ||an||1/n .
(8.8)
(In contrast to the limit inﬁmum, which always exists, the limit might not.) If |λ| >
r(a),
Rλ(a) =
+∞

n=0
(−λ)−(n+1)an ,
(8.9)
because a theorem of Hadamard guarantees that the convergence disc of the Laurent
series of an analytic function touches the singularity closest to the point at inﬁnity.
In our case all singularities belong to the spectrum σ(a), so the boundary consists of
points λ ∈C with |λ| > r(a). Therefore the above series converges for any λ ∈C
such that |λ| > r(a), hence it converges absolutely on any disc, centred at inﬁnity,
passing through such λ. In particular
|λ|−(n+1)||an|| →0 ,
as n →+∞, for any λ ∈C with |λ| > r(a). Hence for any ε > 0
||an||1/n < ε1/n|λ|(n+1)/n = (ε|λ|)1/n|λ|
deﬁnitely. Since (ε|λ|)1/n →1 for n →+∞, we have lim supn ||an||1/n ≤|λ| for
every λ ∈C with |λ| > r(a). We can get as close as we want to r(a) with |λ|, so
lim supn ||an||1/n ≤r(a). Finally, by (8.8),

8.1 Spectrum, Resolvent Set and Resolvent Operator
405
r(a) ≤lim inf
n ||an||1/n ≤lim sup
n
||an||1/n ≤r(a) .
This shows the limit of ||an||1/n exists as n →+∞, and it coincides with r(a).
(b) By Proposition 3.44(a) we have ||an|| = ||a||n if a is normal. Gelfand’s formula
gives
r(a) =
lim
n→+∞||an||1/n =
lim
n→+∞(||a||n)1/n = ||a|| .
Equation (8.7) follows from a property of C∗-algebras, i.e. ||a∗a|| = ||a||2 for any
a, because a∗a is self-adjoint hence normal.
⊓⊔
Identity (8.7) explains that the norm of a C∗-algebra is uniquely determined by
algebraic properties, because the spectral radius is obtainable from the spectrum,
and this in turn is built by algebraic means entirely.
Corollary 8.16 A unital ∗-algebra A admits one norm at most that makes it a unital
C∗-algebra.
Notation 8.17 Let A and A1 be C∗-algebras with unit and take a ∈A1 ∩A. A priori,
the element a could have two different spectra if thought of as element of A1 or of
A. That is why here, and in other similar situations where confusion might arise, we
will label spectra: σA(a) or σA1(a).
■
There is another important consequence of (8.7) concerning algebra homomor-
phisms, to which we will return later with a general theorem. Remarkably enough,
∗-homomorphisms mapping unital Banach ∗-algebras to unital C∗-algebras are con-
tinuous. Later we will see something stronger when domain and target are unital
C∗-algebras: if injective, namely, ∗-homomorphisms are automatically isometric.
Corollary 8.18 Let φ : A →B be a ∗-homomorphism between a unital Banach
∗-algebra A and a unital C∗-algebra B. Then
(a) φ is continuous, for ||φ(a)||B ≤||a||A for any a ∈A;
(b) for every a ∈A, σB(φ(a)) ⊂σA(a);
(c) if A is a unital C∗-algebra and φ is additionally a ∗-isomorphism, it is also
isometric: ||φ(a)||B = ||a||A for any a ∈A, and σB(φ(a)) = σA(a) for any a ∈A.
Proof We start with the proof of (b). If a′ exists such that (a −λIA)a′ = a′(a −
λIA) = IA, applying the ∗-homomorphism φ we conclude (φ(a) −λIB)φ(a′) =
φ(a′)(φ(a) −λIB) = IB, so ρ(φ(a)) ⊃ρ(a) and the claim follows.
Let us pass to (a). By part (b), σ(φ(a)) ⊂σ(a), and r(φ(a)) ≤r(a). Equation (8.7)
implies ||φ(a)||2
B = rB(φ(a)∗φ(a)) = rB(φ(a∗a)) ≤rA(a∗a) ≤||a||2
A, where we
have also used (8.3).
(c) is obvious from (a) and (b), replicating the argument for φ−1.
⊓⊔
To end the abstract considerations we are making, let us present the next result on
C∗-algebras in relationship to the classiﬁcation (i)-(iv) of Deﬁnition 3.40.

406

Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
Proposition 8.19 Let A be a unital C∗-algebra (in particular B(H), H Hilbert
space).
(a) If a ∈A admits a left inverse, then σ(a−1) = σ(a)−1 := {λ−1 | λ ∈σ(A)}.
(b) If a ∈A is isometric, i.e. a∗a = I, then r(a) = 1.
(c) If a ∈A is unitary, i.e. a∗a = aa∗= I, then σ(a) ⊂S1 ⊂C.
(d) If a ∈A is self-adjoint, i.e. a = a∗, then σ(a) ⊂R. More precisely, σ(a) ⊂
[−||a||, ||a||], and σ(a2) ⊂[0, ||a||2].
(e) If a, b ∈A then σ(ab) \ {0} = σ(ba) \ {0}.
Proof (a) If a is left-invertible, 0 /∈σ(a) ∪σ(a−1). For λ ̸= 0, then,
λI −a = λa(a−1 −λ−1I) and λ−1I −a−1 = λ−1a−1(a −λI) .
Thus a −λI is invertible iff a−1 −λ−1I is.
(b) If a∗a = I then ||an||2 = ||(an)∗an|| = ||(a∗)nan|| = ||I|| = 1. Gelfand’s
formula implies r(a) = 1.
(c) By (b) and the deﬁnition of spectral radius we infer σ(a) ⊂{λ ∈C | |λ| ≤1}.
On the other hand we know from Proposition 8.14 that σ(a) = σ(a∗). As a∗= a−1
and using part (a) we have σ(a) = σ(a)
−1. Hence any element λ ∈σ(a) satisﬁes
|λ| ≤1 and can be written as λ = μ−1, |μ| ≤1. This implies |λ| = 1.
(d) First of all we prove σ(a) ⊂R. Fix λ ∈R, λ−1 > ||a||, so that | −iλ−1| =
λ−1 > r(a) and consequently I + iλa = iλ(−iλ−1I + a) is invertible. Deﬁne
b := (I −iλa)(I + iλa)−1. Then b∗= (I −iλa)−1(I + iλa), and since the terms in
brackets trivially commute,
b∗b = (I −iλa)−1(I + iλa)(I −iλa)(I + iλa)−1 = I .
A similar computation gives bb∗= I, making b unitary. We may then invoke part
(c), so that σ(b) ⊂S1. Directly, |(1 −iλμ)(1 + iλμ)−1| = 1 iff μ ∈R. Therefore
z := (1 −iλμ)(1 + iλμ)−1I −b
is invertible when μ ∈C \ R. Solving the expression of b for a gives
z = 2iλ(I + iλμ)−1(a −μI)(I + iλa)−1,
hence a −μI is invertible for any μ ∈C \ R. It follows σ(a) ⊂R. But r(a) = ||a||,
so σ(a) ⊂[−||a||, ||a||] is immediate by deﬁnition of spectral radius.
(d) follows from Proposition 8.14(a, b).
(e) If c is the inverse of I −ab, then (I + bca)(I −ba) = I −ba + bc(I −ab)a = I
and (I −ba)(I + bca) = I −ba + b(I −ab)ca = I. Hence I + bca inverts I −ba,
implying (e).
⊓⊔
We might ask ourselves whether there exist C∗-algebras that cannot be realised as
algebras of operators on Hilbert spaces. The answer is no, even if the identiﬁcation
between the C∗-algebra and a C∗-algebra of operators is not ﬁxed uniquely. In fact,

8.1 Spectrum, Resolvent Set and Resolvent Operator
407
the following truly paramount result holds, which we shall prove as Theorem14.29
after the GNS theorem (Chap.14).
Theorem (Gelfand–Najmark). If A is a C∗-algebra with unit, there exist a Hilbert
space H and an isometric
∗-isomorphism φ : A →B, where B ⊂B(H) is a
unital C∗-subalgebra of B(H).
8.2
Functional Calculus: Representations of Commutative
C∗-Algebras of Bounded Maps
This section aims to show how to represent an algebra of bounded measurable func-
tions f by an algebra of functions f (T, T ∗) of a bounded normal operator T . We
shall construct a continuous map

ΦT : Mb(K) ∋f →f (T, T ∗) ∈B(H) ,
preserving the structure of unital, commutative C∗-algebra, from bounded measur-
able functions deﬁned on a compact set K, to bounded operators on a Hilbert space
H (see Examples2.29(4) and 3.48(1)). This will be a representation (Deﬁnition 3.52)
of the unital, commutative C∗-algebra Mb(K) on H. It will be “generated” by a nor-
mal operator T ∈B(H), and K = σ(T ). The idea of viewing 
ΦT ( f ) as f (T ),
when T = T ∗, arises also from the physical interpretation related to the notion of
observable, as we shall see. This theory goes under the name of functional calculus.
In a subsequent section we will show how the operator f (T, T ∗) can be understood
as an integral of f with respect to an operator-valued measure. For the time being
we shall construct f (T, T ∗) with no mention to spectral measures.
The ﬁrst part of the construction involves only continuous maps f , and one speaks
about continuous functional calculus. Continuous functional calculus overlooks the
concrete C∗-algebra of bounded operators, and is valid more abstractly if we replace
T by a normal element a in a given C∗-algebra. Therefore we shall work ﬁrst in an
abstract setting, and build a continuous functional calculus for self-adjoint elements.
Afterwards we will consider normal elements in a general C∗-algebra with unit, using
the Gelfand transform. Eventually, when dealing with measurable functions, we will
return to operator algebras. By the way, continuous functional calculus touches upon
∗-homomorphisms of C∗-algebras, and allows to characterise positive elements of a
C∗-algebra, as we will explain in a moment.
8.2.1
Abstract C∗-Algebras: Functional Calculus for
Continuous Maps and Self-adjoint Elements
Let us put ourselves in a general case where A is a C∗-algebra with unit I. We
may think rather concretely that A = B(H) for some Hilbert space H, although the
following considerations transcend this case.

408
8
Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
The ﬁrst step to build the aforementioned ∗-homomorphisms is to study polyno-
mial functions of a self-adjoint element a∗= a ∈A.
Deﬁne the function φa that maps a polynomial with complex coefﬁcients p =
p(x), x ∈R, to the normal element p(a) of A, in the obvious way: i.e., evaluating
at a and interpreting the product in the algebra. Set also a0 := I.
This map φa has interesting features, of immediate proof:
(a) it is linear: φa(αp + βp′) = αφa(p) + βφa(p′) for any α, β ∈C;
(b) it transforms a product of polynomials into a composite in the algebra: φa(p ·
p′) = φa(p)φa(p′);
(c) it maps the constant polynomial 1 to the neutral element: φa(1) = I.
By Deﬁnition 2.24 these properties make φa a homomorphism of algebras with unit,
from the unital commutative ∗-algebra of complex polynomials to the unital C∗-
algebra A.
Here are other properties:
(d) φa maps the polynomial R ∋x →x (denoted x, inappropriately) to a, i.e.
φa(x) = a;
(e) if p is the conjugate polynomial to p (p(x) = p(x), x ∈R), then φa(p)∗=
φa(p);
(f) if ba = ab for some b ∈A, then bφa(p) = φa(p)b for any polynomial p.
Property (e) establishes that φa is a ∗-homomorphism (Deﬁnition 3.40) from the
unital ∗-algebra of polynomials to the unital C∗-algebra A.
There is a further property if we deal with self-adjoint elements. Since a = a∗,
φa(p) = p(a) is normal. By virtue of Theorem8.15(b)
||p(a)|| = r(p(a)) = sup{|μ| | μ ∈σ(p(a))} .
The fact that σ(p(a)) = p(σ(a)) (Proposition 8.14(a)) implies
||φa(p)|| = sup{|p(x)| | x ∈σ(a)} .
(8.10)
That is to say: if the algebra of polynomials on σ(a) is endowed with norm || ||∞,
φa is an isometry. As we shall see, this fact can be generalised beyond polynomials.
Remark 8.20 Assuming σ(a) is not a ﬁnite set, with a minor reinterpretation of the
symbols we denote, henceforth, by φa the map sending a function p↾σ(a) to p(a) ∈A,
where p is a polynomial. Thus ||p||∞will for instance indicate the least upper bound
of the absolute value of p over the compact set σ(a). Properties (a)-(f) still hold,
because a polynomial’s restriction to an inﬁnite set determines the polynomial: the
difference of two polynomials (in R or C, with complex coefﬁcients) is a polynomial,
and if it has inﬁnitely many zeroes it must be the null polynomial.
In the case σ(a) is ﬁnite, the matter is more delicate, because the restriction q↾σ(a)
of a polynomial q does not determine the polynomial completely. However,
||q(a)|| = sup{|q(x)| | x ∈σ(a)}

8.2 Functional Calculus: Representations of Commutative C∗-Algebras …
409
implies immediately that if q↾σ(a)= q′↾σ(a) then q(a) = q′(a). Therefore everything
we say will work for σ(a) ﬁnite as well, even though we will not distinguish much
the two situations.
■
Recall that the space C(X) of complex-valued, continuous maps on a compact
space X (cf. Example2.29(4), 3.48(1) in §2, 3), is a commutative C∗-algebra with
unit: the norm is || ||∞, sum and product are the standard pointwise operations, the
involution is the complex conjugation and the unit is the constant map 1.
Theorem 8.21 (Functional calculus for continuous maps and self-adjoint elements)
Let A be a C∗-algebra with unit I and a ∈A a self-adjoint element.
(a) There exists a unique ∗-homomorphism deﬁned on the unital, commutative C∗-
algebra C(σ(a)):
Φa : C(σ(a)) ∋f →f (a) ∈A
such that
Φa(x) = a,
(8.11)
x being the map σ(a) ∋x →x.
(b) The following properties hold:
(i) Φa is isometric: for any f ∈C(σ(a)), ||Φa( f )|| = || f ||∞;
(ii) if ba = ab with b ∈A, then bf (a) = f (a)b for any f ∈C(σ(a));
(iii) Φa preserves involutions: Φa( f ) = Φa( f )∗for any f ∈C(σ(a)).
(c) σ( f (a)) = f (σ(a)) for any f ∈C(σ(a)).
(d) If B is a C∗-algebra with unit and π : A →B a ∗-homomorphism:
π( f (a)) = f (π(a)) for any f ∈C(σ(a)).
Proof In the sequel we assume the spectrum of a is inﬁnite; the ﬁnite case must be
treated separately by keeping in account the previous remark. We leave this easy task
to the reader.
(a) Let us show existence. The spectrum σ(a) ⊂C is compact by Theorem8.4(c),
and C(σ(a)) is Hausdorff because C is, so we can use Stone-Weierstrass (Theo-
rem2.30). The space P(σ(a)) of polynomials p = p(x) restricted to x ∈σ(a) and
with complex coefﬁcients is a subalgebra in C(σ(a)) that contains the unit (the func-
tion 1), separates points in σ(a) and is closed under complex conjugation. Hence
Theorem2.30 guarantees it is dense in C(σ(a)). Consider the map
φa : P(σ(a)) ∋p →p(a) ∈A ,
to properties (a)–(f). We know φa is linear and ||φa(p)|| = ||p||∞by (8.10), which
implies continuity. By Proposition 2.47 there is a unique bounded linear operator
Φa : C(σ(a)) →A extending φa to C(σ(a)) and preserving the norm. This must
be a homomorphism of unital algebras because: (a) it is linear, (b) Φa( f · g) =
Φa( f )Φa(g) by continuity (it is true on the subalgebra of polynomials, by deﬁnition

410
8
Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
of φa), (c) it maps the constant function 1 ∈P(σ(a)) to the identity I ∈A, by
deﬁnition of φa. Equation (8.11) holds trivially by property (d). That Φa is a ∗-
homomorphismisduetothisargument:if{pn}arepolynomialsconverginguniformly
on σ(a) to the continuous map f , {pn} tends uniformly on σ(a) to the continuous map
f ; as seen above, though (cf. property (e)), Φa(pn) = φa(pn) = φa(pn)∗= Φa(pn)∗
and Hermitian conjugation is continuous in the uniform topology. By continuity of
Φa, Φa( f ) = Φa( f )∗.
Now to uniqueness. Any ∗-homomorphism χa of C∗-algebras with unit, fulﬁlling
(8.11), must agree with Φa on integer powers of x, hence on any polynomial by def-
inition of ∗-homomorphism. Moreover χa must be continuous by Corollary8.18(a).
Since χa and Φa are linear, by Proposition 2.47 χa coincides with Φa.
(b) Property (iii) was proved above. (i) and (ii) are immediate for polynomials, so
they extend by continuity to C(σ(a)).
(c) Observe ﬁrst that the set of non-invertible elements in A is closed under the norm
because its complement is open (Proposition 2.27). Consider a polynomial sequence
{pn} converging to some f ∈C(σ(a)) uniformly on σ(a). Then pn(λ) ∈σ(pn(a))
by Proposition 8.14(a), i.e. pn(a)−pn(λ)I is not invertible. The set of non-invertible
elements is closed in A, so we can take the limit and obtain that f (a) −f (λ)I is
not invertible. Hence f (λ) ∈σ( f (a)) and then f (σ(a)) ⊂σ( f (a)). Conversely, if
μ /∈f (σ(a)), then g : σ(a) ∋λ →( f (λ) −μ)−1 is in C(σ(a)). That is because
f is continuous and f (σ(a)) closed (continuous image in C of a compact set). By
construction g(a)( f (a) −μI) = ( f (a) −μI)g(a) = I, so f (a) −μI is invertible,
hence μ /∈σ( f (a)).
(d) The statement is true if f is a polynomial. By the continuity of π (Corol-
lary8.18(a)) it stays true when passing to continuous maps.
⊓⊔
What we would like to do now is generalise the above theorem to normal elements,
not necessarily self-adjoint, in a unital C∗-algebra A. We want to deﬁne an element
f (a, a∗) ∈A for an arbitrary continuous map f deﬁned on the spectrum σ(a) ⊂C
of a, so that its norm is || f ||∞.
One possibility is to do as follows:
(1) start from polynomials p(z, z) (dense in C(σ(a)) by the Stone-Weierstrass
theorem) deﬁned on the spectrum of a;
(2) associate to each p(z, z) the polynomial operator p(a, a∗) ∈A;
(3) show the above correspondence is a continuous ∗-homomorphism of unital
∗-algebras.
Yet there is a problem when we pass from polynomials to continuous maps by
a limiting procedure. We should prove ||p(a, a∗)|| ≤||p||∞. In case a is self-
adjoint the equality was proved using ‘spectral invariance’ (Proposition 8.14(a),
i.e. σ(p(a)) = p(σ(a))) and Theorem8.15(b), for which ||p(a)|| = r(p(a)) =
sup{|μ| ∈C | μ ∈σ(p(a))}. In the case at stake there is nothing guaranteeing
σ(p(a, a∗)) = p(σ(a, a∗)). The failure of the fundamental theorem of algebra for
complex polynomials in the variables z and z is the main cause of the lack of a direct
proof of the above fact, and the reason why we have to look for an alternative, albeit
very interesting, way.

8.2.2
Key Properties of ∗-Homomorphisms of C∗-Algebras,
Spectra and Positive Elements
This section is devoted to a series of technical corollaries to Theorem8.21, essential
to extend continuous functional calculus to normal, not self-adjoint, elements. A
number of results are nonetheless interesting on their own.
Corollary 8.18(c) tells that a ∗-homomorphism φ : A →B between C∗-algebras
with unit is isometric if one-to-one and onto. But surjectivity is not necessary, for
a consequence of the previous theorem is that injectivity is equivalent to the norm
being preserved. We encapsulate in the next statement also Corollary8.18(a), which
we proved earlier.
Theorem 8.22 (On ∗-homomorphisms of unital C∗-algebras) A ∗-homomorphism
π : A →B of unital C∗-algebras is continuous, for
||π(a)||B ≤||a||A for any a ∈A.
Furthermore
(a) π is one-to-one iff isometric, i.e. ||π(a)|| = ||a|| for any a ∈A.
(b) π(A) is a unital C∗-subalgebra inside B.
Proof As said, the ﬁrst statement is Corollary8.18(a).
(a) If π is isometric it is obviously injective, so we prove the converse. We have
||π(a)|| ≤||a|| by Corollary8.18, so it sufﬁces to prove that injectivity forces
||π(a)|| ≥||a||. If that is true for self-adjoint elements in a C∗-algebra with unit, it
holds for any element:
||π(a)||2 = ||π(a)∗π(a)||2 = ||π(a∗a)|| ≥||a∗a|| = ||a||2 .
So assume there is a self-adjoint element a ∈A with ||π(a)|| < ||a||. Then Propo-
sition 8.19 says σA(a) ⊂[−||a||, ||a||] and r(a) = ||a||, so ||a|| ∈σA(a) or
−||a|| ∈σA(a). Similarly σB(π(a)) ⊂[−||π(a)||, ||π(a)||]. Choose a continuous
map f : [−||a||, ||a||] →R that vanishes on [−||π(a)||, ||π(a)||] and such that
f (−||a||) = f (||a||) = 1. Theorem8.21(d) implies π( f (a)) = f (π(a)) = 0, for
f ↾σB(π(a))= 0 and || f (a)|| = || f ||∞,C(σA(a)) ≥1. Then f (a) ̸= 0, contradicting
the injectivity of π.
(b) Consider the set K := Ker(π) := {a ∈A | π(a) = 0}. One easily proves that K
is a closed two-sided ∗-ideal of A. The closure arises from ||π(a)|| ≤||a||. In view
of the fact that K is a two-sided ∗-ideal of A, the quotient vector space A1 := A/K
has a natural ∗-algebra structure induced from that of A. Moreover, it is known that
||[a]|| := inf{||a + b|| | b ∈K} is a C∗-norm on A1 (see Theorem 3.1.4 in [Mur90]).
By construction π1 : A1 →B, π1([a]) := π(a) for a ∈A, is a well-deﬁned ∗-
homomorphism. However π1 is injective – and therefore it is isometric by (a) – and,
by construction π1(A1) = π(A). Now claim (b) is immediate because π1 is isometric

and by deﬁnition of unital C∗-subalgebra. In particular, π1 isometric guarantees that
π(A) = π1(A1) is closed in B, hence complete as a normed space.
⊓⊔
A second result shows that the spectrum does not change by restricting to C∗-
subalgebras or taking ∗-isomorphic images.
Theorem 8.23 (Invariance of spectrum) Let A and B be C∗-algebras with unit.
(a) If A is a unital C∗-subalgebra in B,
σA(a) = σB(a) for any a ∈A.
(b) If π : A →B is a ∗-homomorphism,
σB(π(a)) = σπ(A)(π(a)) ⊂σA(a) for any a ∈A.
The last inclusion is an equality if π is one-to-one.
Proof (a) Let us observe, preliminarily, that the unit I is the same in A and B. If
a ∈A moreover, also a∗is the same in A and B. It is clear that ρA(a) ⊂ρB(a),
or equivalently σB(a) ⊂σA(a). Therefore it is enough to prove, for any a ∈A,
that (a −λI) has inverse (a −λI)−1 ∈B belonging to A. This is the same as
demanding that the possible inverse a−1 ∈B to a ∈A is in A. Let us consider
the subcase where a = a∗is invertible in B. Then σB(a) ⊂R, and since ρB(a)
is open and 0 ∈ρB(a) there is a disc D ⊂C of radius r > 0 at the origin that
does not intersect σB(a). Hence f : x →1/x is continuous and bounded on
σB(a), and we can deﬁne f (a) = Φa( f ) using Theorem8.21 on a = a∗∈B.
By construction af (a) = f (a)a = I, i.e. f (a) = a−1 in B. If f (a) ∈A the
proof ends here. By construction of the one-to-one ∗-homomorphism Φa, we have
f (a) = limn→+∞pn(a), where the pn are polynomials and the limit is understood in
B. But pn(a) ∈A by deﬁnition, for A is closed under algebraic operations. Since A
has the induced topology of B and is closed, f (a) ∈A as required, hence a−1 ∈A.
Now consider the case a ∈A not self-adjoint, such that a−1 ∈B. Then also
(a∗)−1 = (a−1)∗∈B and we can write a−1 = (a∗a)−1a∗. Notice a∗a ∈A is
self-adjoint, so (a∗a)−1 ∈A by the previous argument. Trivially a∗∈A, so a−1 =
(a∗a)−1a∗∈A, thus ending part (a).
(b)Theinclusionσπ(A)(π(a)) ⊂σA(a)wasprovedinCorollary8.18(b).Theequality
σB(π(a)) = σπ(A)(π(a)) follows from part (a) and the fact π(A) is a unital C∗-
subalgebra in B by Theorem8.22(b). If π is one-to-one, σπ(A)(π(a)) = σA(a)
follows from (a) and the fact that π : A →π(A) is a ∗-isomorphism of unital
C∗-algebras by Theorem8.22(a).
⊓⊔
Theorem 8.21 also permits to give a reasonable meaning to positive elements in a
C∗-algebra with unit. The deﬁnition and characterisation that follow will play an
important role in advanced formulations of quantum ﬁelds.
Deﬁnition 8.24 An element a in a unital C∗-algebra A is positive if a = a∗and
σ(a) ⊂[0, +∞). The set of positive elements of A is denoted by A+.

8.2 Functional Calculus: Representations of Commutative C∗-Algebras …
413
We have arrived at the characterisation of positive elements, together with other
properties, given in the next result.
Theorem 8.25 (On positive elements in a C∗-algebra with unit) Let A be a C∗-
algebra with unit.
(a) If α1, . . . αn ∈[0, +∞) and a1, . . . , an ∈A are positive, then n
j=1 α ja j is
positive, so A+ is a closed convex cone in A.
(b) The following assertions, for any a ∈A, are equivalent.
(i) a is positive.
(ii) a = a∗and a = c∗c for some c ∈A.
(iii) a = a∗and a = b2 for some self-adjoint b ∈A.
(c) If A0 ⊂A is a unital C∗-subalgebra, then A+
0 = A0 ∩A+, and A0 =< A+
0 >.
(d) If π : A →B is a ∗-homomorphism of unital C∗-algebras, and a ∈A is positive,
then π(a) is positive.
Proof (a) The claim is clearly true if n = 1, for σ(α1a1) = α1σ(a1), and α1a is
self-adjoint iff a1 is and α1 ≥0. So we will just prove the claim for n = 2 with α1
and α2 both non-zero. We will use the fact that d is positive iff self-adjoint, plus
I −||d||−1d
 ≤1 .
The above condition implies σ

I −||d||−1d

⊂[−1, 1] i.e. 1 −||d||−1σ(d) ⊂
[−1, 1], by the properties of the spectral radius. This implies σ(d) ⊂[0, 2||d||],
so d is positive. Conversely, if d is positive then σ(d) ⊂[0, ||d||], so as before
||I −||d||−1d|| ≤1. If d = d∗and
||I −d|| ≤1
then d is positive with ||d|| ≤2. The proof is the same as the previous one. All these
facts in turn imply, if a1 and a2 are self-adjoint, positive, with ||a1|| = ||a2|| = 1 and
α1, α2 ∈(0, 1), α1 + α2 = 1, that the self-adjoint element α1a1 + α2a2 is positive.
In fact,
||I −α1a1 + α2a2|| ≤α1||I −a1|| + α2||I −a2|| ≤α1 + α2 = 1
so α1a1 + α2a2 is positive. Multiply by λ > 0, so (renaming constants) λμa1 +
λ(1 −μ)a2 is positive whichever μ ∈(0, 1) and λ ∈(0, +∞) are chosen. If we
now take α1, α2 > 0 without further conditions, λ = α1 + α2 ∈(0, +∞) and
μ = α1/(α1 + α2) ∈(0, 1) immediately, and
λμa1 + λ(1 −μ)a2 = α1a1 + α2a2 .
But now α1a1 +α2a2 is positive for arbitrary α1, α2 > 0, so the claim is proved (note
that the constraint ||a1|| = ||a2|| = 1 has disappeared). Let us show A+ is closed. If
A+ ∋an →a ∈A then ||an −a|| →0, so ||an|| −||a|| →0. That an ∈A+, by the

414
8
Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
properties of spectrum and spectral radius, implies || ||an||I −an|| ≤||an||. In the
limit n →+∞we ﬁnd || ||an||I −a|| ≤||a||, hence a ∈A+.
(b) If (iii) holds, Proposition 8.19(d) gives σ(a) = σ(b2) = {λ2 | λ ∈σ(a)} ⊂
[0, +∞), so (iii) implies (i). Now the converse. Using continuous functional calculus,
and recalling a = a∗, the real continuous map √· : σ(a) ∋x →√x allows to
deﬁne √a := Φa(√·). Set b := √a, so b = b∗and b2 = a, because Φa is a ∗-
homomorphism. Hence (i) and (iii) are equivalent. That (iii) implies (ii) is obvious.
So there remains to show (ii) ⇒(i). Let a = a∗, a = c∗c, and we claim σ(a) ⊂
[0, +∞). By contradiction assume σ(−a) ⊂(0, +∞). Then Proposition 8.19(e)
tells σ(−cc∗) \ {0} = σ(−c∗c) \ {0} ⊂(0, +∞). By decomposing c := c1 + ic2,
with c1, c2 self-adjoint, we have
c∗c + cc∗= 2c2
1 + 2c2
2 .
But c2
1 and c2
2 are positive by (iii), and −cc∗is positive by assumption. Hence the
linear combination with positive coefﬁcients 2c2
1 + 2c2
2 −cc∗= c∗c is a positive
operator by (a). Therefore σ(c∗c) ⊂[0, +∞), but since σ(−c∗c) \ {0} ⊂(0, +∞)
as well, we have σ(c∗c) = {0} i.e. σ(a) = σ(−a) = {0}, a contradiction. Hence
σ(−a) ⊂(−∞, 0], i.e. σ(a) ⊂[0, +∞), so (ii) implies (i).
(c) If a ∈A0 is positive in A, it is positive in A0 and conversely, for σA(a) = σA0(a)
by Theorem8.23(a), and also a = a∗is invariant. Hence A+
0 = A0 ∩A+. If a ∈A0,
write a = a1 + ia2, with a1 := (a + a∗)/2 and a2 := (a −a∗)/(2i) self-adjoint.
If b is self-adjoint, we can deﬁne b+ := (|b| + b)/2 and b−:= (|b| −b)/2, where
|b| = Φb(|·|) and |·| : C →[0, +∞) is the modulus. Since Φb is a ∗-homomorphism
and |·| is real-valued, b+ and b−are self-adjoint because b is (in particular σ(b) ⊂R).
Property (c) in Theorem8.21 says b+ and b−are positive, as |x| ± x ≥0 for any
x ∈σ(b) ⊂R. In conclusion, every a ∈A0 is the complex linear combination of 4
positive elements in A0, so A0 =< A+
0 >.
(d) This follows immediately from (b) bearing in mind π is a ∗-homomorphism.
⊓⊔
8.2.3
Commutative Banach Algebras and the Gelfand
Transform
In order to generalise the isometric ∗-homomorphism Φa : C(σ(a)) →A (deﬁned
for a∗= a ∈A in Sect.8.2.1) to subsume a normal, not self-adjoint, we shall
introduce some technical results in the theory of commutative Banach (C∗-)algebras,
due to Gelfand and interesting by their own means. We will prove a characterisation
called commutative Gelfand–Najmark theorem, according to which any commutative
C∗-algebra with unit is canonically a C∗-algebra C(X) of functions with norm || ||∞
over the compact Hausdorff space X given by the algebra itself.

8.2 Functional Calculus: Representations of Commutative C∗-Algebras …

We need a technical result that explains the relationship between maximal ideals
in Banach algebras and multiplicative linear functionals, after the mandatory deﬁn-
itions. In the sequel every Banach algebra will be complex.
Deﬁnition 8.26 If A is a Banach algebra with unit, a subset I ⊂A is a
maximal ideal if
(i) I is a linear subspace in A,
(ii) ba, ab ∈I for any a ∈I, b ∈A,
(iii) I ̸= A;
(iv) if I ⊂J, with J as in (i), (ii), then either J = I or J = A.
Remark 8.27 Conditions (i) and (ii) say I is an ideal, whereas (iii) prescribes the
ideal must be proper. Maximality is expressed by (iv).
■
Deﬁnition 8.28 If A is a Banach algebra with unit, a multiplicative linear functional
φ : A →C is called a character of A (where multiplicative means φ(ab) =
φ(a)φ(b)).
If A is also commutative, the set of non-trivial characters is denoted by σ(A) and
called the spectrum of the algebra.
Now we can state and prove the advertised proposition.
Proposition 8.29 Let A be a Banach algebra with unit I.
(a) A character χ of A is non-zero iff χ(I) = 1.
(b) A maximal ideal I ⊂A is closed.
(c) If A is commutative, the map I : σ(A) ∋χ →Ker(χ) ⊂A is a bijection onto
the set of maximal ideals.
(d) If A is commutative, then characters are continuous.
Proof Observe preliminarily that the existence of the unit I in A, with ||I|| = 1,
implies A ̸= {0}.
(a) If χ is a character χ(a) = χ(Ia) = χ(I)χ(a). If χ ̸= 0 then χ(a) ̸= 0 for some
a ∈A. Then χ(I) = 1. If χ(I) ̸= 0, clearly χ ̸= 0.
(b) By assumption I ̸= A, so I /∈I (otherwise a = aI ∈I for any a ∈A). Hence
I /∈I. In fact, if I ∈I, since the set of invertible elements is open (Proposition 2.27),
there would be an open neighbourhood B of I of invertible elements intersecting I.
For any a ∈B ∩I, then, I = a−1a ∈I, which cannot be. Therefore I ̸= A, I being
excluded. Since I ⊃I and I satisﬁes (i), (ii), (iii) in Deﬁnition 8.26, we have I = I
by Deﬁnition 8.26(iv).
(c) If χ ∈σ(A), Ker(χ) is a maximal ideal: (i),(ii) in Deﬁnition 8.26 are true as
χ is linear and multiplicative, and (iii) holds for χ ̸= 0. Notice A = Ker(χ) ⊕V ,
where dim(V ) = 1, for this must be the dimension of the target space C of χ. Hence
any subspace J ⊂A containing Ker(χ) properly must be A itself, so Ker(χ)
is a maximal ideal. Therefore the map I sends characters to maximal ideals. Let
us show it is one-to-one. If χ, χ′ ∈σ(A) and Ker(χ) = Ker(χ′) = N, from
A = N ⊕V we have χ(a) = χ(va) and χ′(a) = χ′(va), where na ∈N and va ∈V
are the projections of a on N and V . If e is a basis of V (1-dimensional), va = cae

416
8
Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
for some complex number ca determined by a. Hence Ker(χ) = Ker(χ′) implies
χ(a) = avχ(e) and χ′(a) = avχ′(e). By (a) χ(I) = χ′(I) = 1, so χ(e) = χ′(e) and
χ = χ′, proving injectivity. Now surjectivity. If I is a maximal ideal, it is closed by
(b). It is easy to show that the quotient space A/I of cosets [a] (a ∼a′ ⇔a−a′ ∈I)
inherits a natural Banach space structure and a commutative Banach algebra structure
with unit [I] from A. By construction A/I does not contain ideals other than A/I
itself. So any non-null element [a] ∈A/I is invertible, otherwise [a]A/I would be
a proper ideal in A/I. The Gelfand–Mazur Theorem(8.10) guarantees the existence
of a Banach space isomorphism ψ : A/I →C. If π : A ∋a →[a] ∈A/I denotes
the canonical projection (continuous by construction), χ := ψ ◦π : A →C is an
element of σ(A) with trivial null space Ker(χ) = I.
(d) As χ →Ker(χ) is a bijection, the last argument also tells that any character χ
must look like ψ ◦π, for Ker(χ) = I. Hence χ is continuous, because ψ and π
are. ⊓⊔
Now it is time for the ﬁrst theorem of Gelfand on commutative Banach algebras
with unit. We shall refer to the ∗-weak topology on the dual A′ of A (seen as Banach
space) introduced by Deﬁnition 2.72. More precisely, viewing σ(A) as subset of A′
with the induced topology, we consider the unital algebra C(σ(A)) of continuous
maps σ(A) →C with norm ||||∞. One part of the theorem establishes that σ(A) is a
compact Hausdorff space. As we saw in Chaps.2 and 3 (Examples2.29(4), 3.48(1)),
in fact, C(σ(A)) is a Banach algebra with unit (and also a C∗-algebra).
Theorem 8.30 Take a commutative Banach algebra A with unit I and let
G : A ∋x →x : σ(A) →C
(8.12)
denote the Gelfand transform
x(χ) := χ(x) ,
x ∈A, χ ∈σ(A),
(8.13)
Then
(a) σ(A) is a ∗-weakly compact Hausdorff space, and ||χ|| ≤1 if χ ∈σ(A) (||.|| is
the strong norm on A′).
(b) If x ∈A:
σ(x) = {x(χ) | χ ∈σ(A)} .
(c) A ⊂C(σ(A)), and G : A →C(σ(A)) is a homomorphism of unital Banach
algebras.
(d) G : A →C(σ(A)) is continuous, ||x||∞≤||x|| for any x ∈A.
Proof (a) Consider χ ∈σ(A) and the maximal ideal I = Ker(χ) associated to
it under Proposition 8.29(c). If x ∈A, χ(x −χ(x)I) = 0, so x −χ(x)I ∈I
cannot be invertible (cf. Proposition 8.29(b)). Then χ(x) ∈σ(x), so |χ(x)| ≤||x||
by elementary properties of the spectral radius. Consequently ||χ|| ≤1, where the
norm deﬁnes the strong topology. Therefore σ(A) is contained in the unit ball of the

8.2 Functional Calculus: Representations of Commutative C∗-Algebras …
417
dual A′. We know this set is ∗-weakly compact by Theorem2.80 (Banach–Alaoglu).
Since the ∗-weak topology is Hausdorff, to ﬁnish it sufﬁces to show σ(A) is ∗-weakly
closed. Saying σ(A) ∋χn →χ ∈A′ in that topology means χn(x) →χ for any
x ∈A. By continuity χ is a character if all χn are. Thus σ(A) is closed in the ∗-weak
topology.
(b) Above we proved χ(x) ∈σ(x), so {x(χ) | χ ∈σ(A)} ⊂σ(x). Let us prove the
converse inclusion. If λ ∈σ(x) then x−λI is not invertible, so xA := {(x−λI)y|y ∈
A} is a proper ideal. Zorn’s lemma gives us a maximal ideal I containing xA. Let χI ∈
σ(A) be the associated character by Proposition 8.29(c). Then x(χI) = χI(x) = λ
and so {x(χ) | χ ∈σ(A)} ⊃σ(x), as required.
(c)–(d). That G is a homomorphism of algebras with unit is straightforward, because
x acts on characters χ (linear and multiplicative, plusI(χ) := χ(I) = 1). Moreover,
from (b) and the deﬁnition of spectral radius we have ||x||∞= r(x). On the other
hand r(x) ≤||x|| by elementary properties of the spectral radius.
⊓⊔
Example 8.31 Let ℓ1(Z) be the Banach space of maps f : Z →C such that
|| f ||1 :=

n∈Z
| f (n)| < +∞.
Equip ℓ1(Z) with the structure of a unital Banach algebra by deﬁning the product
using the convolution:
( f ∗g)(m) :=

n∈Z
f (m −n)g(n),
f, g ∈ℓ1(Z).
This product is well deﬁned and satisﬁes || f ∗g||1 ≤|| f ||1||g||1, because:

n∈Z
|( f ∗g)(n)| =

|g(m)| || f ||1
= || f ||1 ||g||1 .
There is a unit I, namely the map I(n) = 1 if n = 0 and I(n) = 0 if n ̸= 0. Since
f ∗g = g ∗f , as is easy to see, ℓ1(Z) becomes a commutative Banach algebra with
unit, and we can apply Gelfand’s theory.
Set S1 := {z ∈C | |z| = 1} and deﬁne characters χz associated to z ∈S1:
χz( f ) :=

n∈Z
f (n)zn .

Trivially, these are well-deﬁned characters. Hence we have a function  : S1 ∋
z →χz ∈σ(ℓ1(Z)) easily seen to be invertible. Actually, it is a homeomorphism,
for we shall prove it is a continuous bijection between compact Hausdorff spaces
(Proposition 1.23). Continuity, using the ∗-weak topology on σ(ℓ1(Z)), amounts to
continuity of S1 ∋z →χz( f ) ∈C with f ∈ℓ1(Z) ﬁxed, because z →χz( f ) is the
uniform limit of the continuous map gm(z) := 
|n|<m f (n)zn, for 
n∈Z | f (n)zn| =
|| f ||1 < +∞with |z| = 1.
Therefore we may identify the spectrum σ(ℓ1(Z)) with S1 under the homeomor-
phism . The Gelfand transform f of f ∈ℓ1(Z) is therefore continuous on S1, and
deﬁned by
f (z) :=

n∈Z
f (n)zn .

The elementary theory of Fourier series forces f (n) to be the Fourier coefﬁcient

f (eiθ)e−inθdθ .
Therefore G (ℓ1(Z)) is the subset, in the unital Banach algebra (C(S1), || ||∞), of
maps with absolutely convergent Fourier series. Gelfand observed that there is an
interesting consequence to this fact, which corresponds to a classical statement due
to Wiener (but proved by different means):
Proposition 8.32 If h ∈C(S1) has absolutely convergent Fourier series and no
zeroes, the map S1 ∋z →1/h(z) (belonging in C(S1)) has absolutely convergent
Fourier series.
Proof First, h = f for some f ∈ℓ1(Z). Since f (z) ̸= 0, then 0 /∈σ( f ) by
Theorem8.30(b). Hence f has inverse g ∈ℓ1(Z) and g = 1/h. We conclude that
the Fourier series of 1/h must converge absolutely.
⊓⊔
To conclude we consider the more rigid case in which A is a commutative C∗-
algebra with unit. Then the Gelfand transform deﬁnes an honest ∗-isomorphism of
C∗-algebras with unit, and must be isometric by Theorem8.22(a). In fact we have
the following commutative version of the Gelfand–Najmark theorem.
Theorem 8.33 (Commutative Gelfand–Najmark theorem) Let A be a commutative
C∗-algebra with unit. Then every character of A is a ∗-homomorphism. Moreover,
if we think of C(σ(A)) as a commutative C∗-algebra with unit (for the norm || ||∞),
the Gelfand transform
G : A ∋x →x ∈C(σ(A)) where
x(χ) := χ(x) ,
x ∈A, χ ∈σ(A),
is an isometric ∗-isomorphism.

Proof The only thing to prove is that the Gelfand transform deﬁnes a ∗-isomorphism,
because the rest follows from Theorem8.22(a). Knowing the Gelfand transform is
an algebra homomorphism, though, requires only that we prove surjectivity and the
involution property. The ﬁrst lemma is that x is real if x∗= x ∈A. If so, with t ∈R
we deﬁne
ut := eitx :=
+∞

n=0
(it)n
n! xn
with respect to the norm of A. Since A is commutative, and working as we were in
C, we have u∗
t = ut and u∗
t ut = u0 = I. Taking norms gives ||ut|| = ||u−t|| = 1. If
now χ is a character (continuous, linear and multiplicative), we see χ(ut) = eitχ(x)
and χ(u−t) = e−itχ(x). So by Theorem8.30(d):
|χ(u±t)| = | 
u±t(χ)| ≤|| 
u±t||∞≤||u±t|| ≤1 .
That is to say |e±itχ(x)| ≤1, implying χ(x) ∈R. Now if x ∈A we can decompose
x = a + ib, a = a∗, b = b∗so that χ(x) = χ(a) −iχ(b) = χ(x∗). This
proves that characters of commutative C∗-algebras are ∗-homomorphisms and not
only homomorphisms. Hence, coming back to the Gelfand transform,
x∗(χ) = χ(x∗) = χ(a −ib) = χ(a) −iχ(b) = χ(a) + iχ(b) = χ(x) = x(χ) .
Therefore the Gelfand transform preserves the involution.
To conclude we settle surjectivity, showing {x | x ∈A} = C(σ(A)). The set on
the left is closed as compact (continuous image of a compact set, Theorem8.30) in
a Hausdorff space. By construction, this set is a closed ∗-subalgebra of C(σ(A))
containing the identity (I = 1, identity map). The elements of that algebra separate
points of σ(A): if χ1 ̸= χ1 then χ1(x) ̸= χ2(x) for some x ∈A, so x(χ1) ̸= x(χ2).
The Stone-Weierstrass theorem implies {x | x ∈A} = C(σ(A)).
⊓⊔
Remarks 8.34 (1) The commutative Gelfand–Najmark theorem proves that every
commutative C∗-algebra A with unit is canonically a C∗-algebra C(X) of functions
with norm || ||∞on a compact set X = σ(A). The “points” of X are the characters of
the C∗-algebra. Put equivalently, commutative C∗-algebras with unit are C∗-algebras
of functions built in a canonical manner via the algebra’s spectrum σ(A).
(2) If we start from a concrete C∗-algebra C(X) of functions on a compact Hausdorff
space X, Gelfand’s procedure recovers exactly this algebraic construction, because
characters, in the present case, are nothing but points in X. In fact, any x ∈X can be
mapped one-to-one to the corresponding character χx : C(X) →C, χx( f ) := f (x)
for any f ∈C(X). It can be proved that every character has this form by showing it
is positive (by multiplicativity), and that it must be a positive Borel measure by the
theorem of Riesz. Since the only multiplicative Borel measures are Dirac measures
δx, we have χ( f ) =

X f dδx = f (x) for some x ∈X determined by χ. Observe that

420

the topology on X coincides with the ∗-weak topology if we interpret points x ∈X
as characters χx, as is immediate to verify.
Naïvely speaking, a compact Hausdorff space can be fully described by the com-
mutative C∗-algebra of its continuous complex functions. This remark can be taken,
and indeed was by A. Connes, as a starting point to develop noncommutative geome-
try: instead of using a commutative C∗-algebra with unit one takes a noncommutative
algebra, and the associated “space” is deﬁned in terms of continuous linear function-
als on the algebra.

8.2.4
Abstract C∗-Algebras: Functional Calculus for
Continuous Maps and Normal Elements
We wish to extend Sect.8.2.1 to normal elements a ∈A (a∗a = aa∗) in a C∗-algebra
A with unit I. We want to make sense of the function f (a, a∗) ∈A of a, a∗when f
is a continuous complex-valued map deﬁned on the spectrum of a.
A few preliminary remarks and notational issues must be seen to, before we
proceed to deﬁne f (a, a∗).
We can always decompose a and a∗into linear combinations of two commuting
self-adjoint elements x, y:
a = xa + iya ,
a∗= xa −iya ,
(8.14)
where by deﬁnition
xa := a + a∗
2
,
ya
:=
a −a∗
2i
.
(8.15)
xa and ya are clearly self-adjoint. That they commute is also obvious, for a and a∗
commute.
Decomposition (8.14) reminds of the analogue splitting of a complex number into
real and imaginary parts
z = x + iy ,
z = x −iy ,
(8.16)
where
x := z + z
2
,
y :=
z −z
2i
.
(8.17)
Remark 8.35 The maps f : σ(a) →C we shall deal with are to be thought of as
functions in x and y, imagining σ(a) as subset of R2 rather than C. Equivalently, the
variables may be taken to be z and z, considered independent. They are bijectively
determined by x, y, so maps in x, y are in one-to-one correspondence to maps in z,
z: to f = f (z, z) we may associate

8.2 Functional Calculus: Representations of Commutative C∗-Algebras …
421
g = g(x, y) := f (x + iy, x −iy)
and conversely, to g = g(x, y) is associated
f1 = f1(z, z) := g((z + z)/2, (z −z)/2i) .
Clearly, f1 = f . This fact will be used often without further notice.
■
Now we are ready for the continuous functional calculus for normal elements. The
proof will be substantially different from Theorem8.21, in that it will involve the
Gelfand transform of the previous section. We shall still use the name Φa for the
∗-isomorphism, because it generalises the morphism of Theorem8.21.
Theorem 8.36 (Functional calculus for continuous maps and normal elements) Let
A be a C∗-algebra with unit I and a ∈A a normal element. View f as a function of
the independent variables z and z.
(a) There exists a unique ∗-homomorphism on the unital commutative C∗-algebra
C(σ(a)):
Φa : C(σ(a)) ∋f →f (a, a∗) ∈A ,
such that
Φa(z) = a
(8.18)
with z being the polynomial σ(a) ∋(z, z) →z.
(b) The following properties hold:
(i) Φa is isometric: for any f ∈C(σ(a)), ||Φa( f )|| = || f ||∞;
(ii) if ba = ab and ba∗= a∗b for some b ∈A, then bf (a, a∗) = f (a, a∗)b for
any f ∈C(σ(a));
(iii) Φa preserves involutions: Φa( f ) = Φa( f )∗for any f ∈C(σ(a)).
(c) σ( f (a, a∗)) = f (σ(a), σ(a)) for any f ∈C(σ(a)).
(d) If B is a C∗-algebra with unit and π : A →B a ∗-homomorphism,
π( f (a, a∗)) = f (π(a), π(a∗)) for any f ∈C(σA(a)).
(e) If a = a∗the ∗-homomorphism Φa coincides with its analogue of Theorem8.21.
Proof (a)–(b)–(e). Uniqueness is evident because if two ∗-homomorphisms Φa :
C(σ(a)) →A and Φ′
a : C(σ(a)) →A satisfy Φa(z) = Φ′
a(z) = a, by deﬁnition
they coincide on the polynomial algebra in z and z, which is dense in C(σ(a)) in norm
|| ||∞by Stone-Weierstrass (σ(a) is compact and Hausdorff). As ∗-homomorphisms
are continuous (Theorem8.22), Φa( f ) = Φ′
a( f ) for any f ∈C(σ(a)). The same
argument proves, in the case a = a∗, that the ∗-homomorphism Φa coincides with
its cousin in Theorem8.21. Likewise, if Φa is deﬁned, then (ii) in (b) holds, because
if b commutes with a and a∗it commutes with every polynomial in a, a∗, and by
continuity with any Φa( f ).

422
8
Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
Let us show Φa exists and satisﬁes the remaining requests in (a) and (b). Consider
the unital commutative C∗-(sub)algebra Aa ⊂A spanned by I, a and a∗. It is the
closure, for the norm of A, of the set of polynomials p(a, a∗) with complex coefﬁ-
cients. The idea is to deﬁne Φa(a) by G −1( f ), because the inverse Gelfand transform
G −1 : C(σ(A )) →Aa is an isometric ∗-isomorphism by Theorem8.33. The prob-
lem is that now f is deﬁned on σ(Aa), not on σ(a). So let us prove σ(Aa) and
σ(a) are homeomorphic under F : σ(Aa) ∋χ →χ(a) ∈σ(a). That χ(a) ∈σ(a)
follows from Theorem8.30(b). The function is continuous because characters are
continuous, by Proposition 8.29(d), and it acts between compact Hausdorff spaces.
Hence it is enough to show it is bijective to have a homeomorphism (Proposition
1.23). If F(χ) = F(χ′) then χ(a) = χ′(a), χ(a) = χ′(a) (see the proof of Theo-
rem8.33) and χ(a∗) = χ′(a∗). On the other hand χ(I) = χ′(I) = 1 by Proposition
8.29(a). Since χ preserves sums and products, by continuity χ(b) = χ′(b) if b ∈Aa,
and F is injective. F is onto by Theorem8.30(b). Deﬁne
Φa( f ) := G −1( f ◦F)
for f ∈C(σ(a)). By construction Φa is an isometric ∗-isomorphism from C(σ(a))
to Aa such that Φ−1
a (a) = z, where z is σ(a) ∋(z, z) →z. In fact, Φ−1
a (a) = z
means G (a) = z ◦F i.e. χ(a) = z(χ) for any character χ ∈σ(Aa). But the latter
is true by deﬁnition of F. Hence (a), (b) are valid by redeﬁning Φa as valued in the
larger algebra A.
(c) By Theorem8.23, ﬁrst of all, σA( f (a, a∗)) = σAa( f (a, a∗)), so we look at
the spectrum of f (a, a∗) in Aa. Then Φa : C(σ(a)) →Aa deﬁnes an isomet-
ric ∗-isomorphism. The abstract function f (a, a∗) −λI corresponds to the con-
crete map σ(s) ∋(z, z) →f (z, z) −λ. Therefore f (a, a∗) −λI is invertible iff
σ(s) ∋(z, z) →( f (z, z)−λ)−1 is in C(σ(a)). Since the range of f is compact (con-
tinuous image of a compact set), the assertion is equivalent to λ /∈f (σ(a), σ(a)).
Now (c) is immediate.
(d) We prove the equivalent fact π(Φa( f )) = Φπ(a)( f ). By construction C(σ(a)) ∋
f →π(Φa( f )) ∈π(A) and C(σ(a)) ∋f →Φπ(a)( f ) ∈π(A) are continuous
∗-homomorphisms. Trivially, π(Φa(z)) = π(a) = Φπ(a)(z), π(Φa(z)) = π(a)∗=
Φπ(a)(z) and π(Φa(1)) = I = Φπ(a)(1). Therefore π(Φa(p)) = Φπ(a)(p) on poly-
nomials p = p(z, z), and by continuity they coincide on any f ∈σ(a).

C∗-Algebras of Operators in B(H): Functional
Calculus for Bounded Measurable Functions
Let us return to functional calculus for operators and specialise Sect.8.2.4 to A =
B(H), H a Hilbert space. Instead of a normal element a ∈A consider a normal
operator T ∈B(H). Then the ∗-homomorphism ΦT is a representation of C(σ(T ))
on H (deﬁnition 3.52). Here as well it is convenient to decompose T into self-adjoint

8.2 Functional Calculus: Representations of Commutative C∗-Algebras …

operators X, Y ∈B(H):
T = X + iY ,
T ∗= X −iY ,
(8.19)
where
X := T + T ∗
2
,
Y
:=
T −T ∗
2i
.
(8.20)
The operators X and Y are patently self-adjoint by construction, and commute since
T is normal and commutes with T ∗.
As previously remarked, decomposition (8.19) is akin to the real/imaginary
decomposition of a complex number
z = x + iy ,
z = x −iy ,
(8.21)
where
x := z + z
2
,
y :=
z −z
2i
.
(8.22)
As before, we may view f (z, z) as a complex function in x and y. Theorem8.36
specialises, with identical proof, as follows. We refer to Deﬁnition 3.52 for the notion
of representation of a C∗-algebra.
Proposition 8.37 Let H be a Hilbert space and T ∈B(H) a normal operator.
(a) There exists a unique representation of the unital commutative C∗-algebra
C(σ(T )) on H:
ΦT : C(σ(T )) ∋f →f (T, T ∗) ∈B(H) ,
such that
ΦT (z) = T
(8.23)
if z is the polynomial σ(T ) ∋(z, z) →z.
(b) Moreover:
(i) ΦT is faithful, as isometric: for any f ∈C(σ(T )), ||ΦT ( f )|| = || f ||∞;
(ii) if, for A ∈B(H), AT = T A and AT ∗= T ∗A, then AΦT ( f ) = ΦT ( f )A for
any f ∈C(σ(T ));
(iii) ΦT preserves involutions: ΦT ( f ) = ΦT ( f )∗for any f ∈C(σ(T )).
(c) σ(ΦT ( f )) = f (σ(T ), σ(T )), for any f ∈C(σ(T )).
One consequence is worth making explicit.
Corollary 8.38 Let H be a Hilbert space and T ∈B(H) a normal operator. Con-
sider the isometric ∗-homomorphism ΦT : C(σ(T )) →B(H) deﬁned in Proposi-
tion 8.37. Then the set ΦT (C(σ(T ))) of continuous functions in the variables T ,
T ∗(deﬁned on σ(T )) is the smallest C∗-subalgebra with unit in B(H) containing
I and T .

424
8
Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
Proof Every unital C∗-subalgebra A of B(H) containing I and T must contain
polynomials in T , T ∗(restricted to σ(T )). The construction that led to ΦT shows
A contains all continuous maps in T and T ∗, i.e. ΦT (C(σ(T ))). The latter, being
the image of a C∗-algebra with unit under an injective ∗-homomorphism, is a C∗-
subalgebra with unit of B(H) (Theorem8.22(b)).
⊓⊔
The fact that we are now working with a concrete C∗-algebra of operators allows to
make one step forward in functional calculus. We can generalise the above theorem by
deﬁning f (T, T ∗) when f is a bounded and measurable, not necessarily continuous,
map. In order to do so, in the absence of a Stone-Weierstrass-type theorem for
bounded measurable functions (C(X) is not dense in Mb(X) if X is compact with non-
empty interior in Rn, cf. Remark2.29(4)), we shall use heavily Riesz’s representation
results (for Hilbert spaces and Borel measures).
Recall that on a topological space X, B(X) is the Borel σ-algebra on X. The
C∗-algebra of bounded measurable maps f : X →C is indicated by Mb(X) (Exam-
ples2.29(3) and 3.48(1)).
Proposition 8.37 can be generalised to prove the existence and uniqueness of a
∗-homomorphism of unital C∗-algebras Mb(σ(T )) →B(H) (the topology on σ(T )
is induced by C ⊃σ(T )). The consequences of the next theorem are legion. It will,
in particular, be a crucial ingredient to prove the existence of spectral measures, in
Theorem8.56. Statement (iii) in (b) will be completed by Theorem9.11.
Theorem 8.39 (Functional calculus for bounded measurable functions of normal
operators) Let H be a Hilbert space and T ∈B(H) a normal operator.
(a) There is a unique representation of the unital commutative C∗-algebra Mb(σ(T ))
(with respect to || ||∞) on H:

ΦT : Mb(σ(T )) ∋f →f (T, T ∗) ∈B(H)
such that:
(i) if z is the polynomial σ(a) ∋(z, z) →z,

ΦT (z) = T ;
(8.24)
(ii) if { fn}n∈N ⊂Mb(σ(T )) is bounded and converges pointwise to f : σ(T ) →
C, then

ΦT ( f ) = w- lim
n→+∞
ΦT ( fn) .
(b) The mapping 
ΦT enjoys these properties:
(i) the restriction of 
ΦT to C(σ(T )) is the ∗-homomorphism ΦT of Proposition
8.37;
(ii) for any f ∈Mb(σ(T )), ||
ΦT ( f )|| ≤|| f ||∞;
(iii) with A ∈B(H), if AT = T A and AT ∗= T ∗A then A 
ΦT ( f ) = 
ΦT ( f )A
for any f ∈Mb(σ(T ));
(iv) 
ΦT preserves involutions: 
ΦT ( f ) = 
ΦT ( f )∗for any f ∈Mb(σ(T ));

(v)if{ fn}n∈N ⊂Mb(σ(T ))isboundedandconvergespointwiseto f : σ(T ) →C,
then

ΦT ( f ) = s- lim
n→+∞
ΦT ( fn) ;
(vi) if f ∈Mb(σ(T )) takes only real values and f ≥0, then 
ΦT ( f ) ≥0.
Proof (a). Fix x, y ∈H. The map
Lx,y : C(σ(T )) ∋f →(x|ΦT ( f )y) ∈C
is linear and ||Lx,y|| is given by:
sup{|Lx,y( f )| | f ∈C(σ(T )) ,
|| f ||∞= 1}
≤||x|| ||y|| sup{||ΦT ( f )|| | f ∈C(σ(T )) ,
|| f ||∞= 1}
(Cauchy–Schwarz was used). Since ΦT is isometric we ﬁnd
||Lx,y|| ≤||x|| ||y|| ,
so Lx,y is bounded.
By Theorem2.52 (Riesz’s representation theorem for complex measures) there
existsauniquecomplexmeasureμx,y (Deﬁnition1.81)onthecompactsetσ(T ) ⊂C,
such that for any f ∈C(σ(T )):
Lx,y( f ) = (x|ΦT ( f )y) =

σ(T )
f (λ) dμx,y(λ) .
(8.25)
Moreover, |μx,y|(σ(T )) = ||Lx,y|| ≤||x|| ||y||. Aside, note that x = y forces
μx,x to be a real, positive, ﬁnite measure: in fact, if f ∈C(σ(T )) is real-valued
ΦT ( f ) = ΦT ( f )∗by part (iii) of Proposition 8.37(b), so

σ(T )
f (λ) h(λ)d|μx,x(λ)| =

σ(T )
f (λ) h(λ)d|μx,x(λ)| = (x|ΦT ( f )x) = (ΦT ( f )x|x)
= (x|ΦT ( f )x) =

σ(T )
f (λ) h(λ)d|μx,x(λ)| ,
where we have written dμx,x as hd|μx,x|, h being a measurable map of unit norm
determined, almost everywhere, by μx,x (Theorem1.87), and |μx,x| being the total
variation of μx,x (Remark 1.82(2)). By linearity

σ(T)
f (λ) h(λ)d|μx,x(λ)| =

σ(T )
f (λ) h(λ)d|μx,x(λ)|

426
8
Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
must hold when f ∈C(σ(T )) is complex-valued. Riesz’s Theorem2.52 on complex
measures guarantees hd|μx,x| = hd|μx,x|, so h(λ) = h(λ) almost everywhere; but
|h(λ)| = 1, so h(λ) = 1 almost everywhere, and hence μx,x is a real, positive and
ﬁnite measure (so is |μx,x|).
Use (8.25) to generalise Lx,y( f ) to the case f ∈Mb(σ(T )), since the right-hand
side is well deﬁned anyway: if g ∈Mb(σ(T )),
Lx,y(g) :=

σ(T )
g(λ) dμx,y(λ) .
(8.26)
By general properties of complex measures (cf. Example2.48(1)):
|Lx,y(g)| ≤||g||∞|μx,y|(σ(T )) ≤||g||∞||x|| ||y|| .
(8.27)
By construction, given g ∈C(σ(T )), (x, y) →Lx,y(g) is antilinear in x and linear
in y. One can prove this is still valid for g ∈Mb(σ(T)). Let us for instance show
linearity in y, the other part being similar. Given x, y, z ∈H and g ∈Mb(σ(T)), if
α, β ∈C then
α

σ(T )
g(λ) dμx,y(λ) + β

σ(T )
g(λ) dμx,z(λ) =

σ(T)
g(λ) dν(λ) ,
(8.28)
where ν is the complex measure ν(E) := αμx,y(E) + βμx,z(E) for any Borel set
E ⊂σ(T ). Remembering how we deﬁned the μx,y (cf. (8.25)) and using the inner
product’s linearity on the right, we immediately see that for any f ∈C(σ(T ))
replacing g in (8.28):

σ(T )
f (λ) dμx,αy+βz(λ) =

σ(T )
f (λ) dν(λ) .
Riesz’s theorem now tells μx,αy+βz = ν. Therefore (8.28) reads, for any
g ∈
Mb(σ(T )):
α

σ(T )
g(λ) dμx,y(λ) + β

σ(T )
g(λ) dμx,z(λ) =

σ(T)
g(λ) μx,αy+βz(λ) .
We proved Lx,y(g) is linear in y for any given x ∈H and any g ∈Mb(σ(T )).
Equation (8.27) implies the linear operator y →Lx,y(g) is bounded, so by The-
orem3.16 (Riesz once again), given g ∈Mb(σ(T )) and x ∈H, there exists a unique
vx ∈H such that Lx,y(g) = (vx|y) for any y ∈H. Since vx is linear in x (Lx,y(g)
is antilinear in x and the inner product (vx|y) is antilinear in vx), there is also a
unique operator g(T, T ∗)′ ∈L(H) such that vx = g(T, T ∗)′x for any x ∈H. Hence
Lx,y(g) = (g(T, T ∗)′x|y). Condition (8.27) implies g(T, T ∗)′ is bounded, for:
||g(T, T ∗)′x||2 = |(g(T, T ∗)′x|g(T, T ∗)′x)| = |Lx,g(T,T ∗)′x(g)| ≤||g||∞||x|| ||g(T, T ∗)′x|| ,

hence
||g(T, T ∗)′x||
||x||
≤||g||∞
and then ||g(T, T ∗)′|| ≤||g||∞.
Setting g(T, T ∗) := g(T, T ∗)′∗, we proved that for g ∈Mb(σ(T )) there is a
unique operator g(T, T ∗) ∈B(H) such that
Lx,y(g) = (x|g(T, T ∗)y)
for any x, y ∈H. The linear mapping

ΦT : Mb(σ(T )) ∋f →f (T, T ∗) ∈B(H) ,
where, for any x, y ∈H,
Lx,y( f ) = (x| f (T, T ∗)y) :=

σ(T )
f (λ) dμx,y(λ) ,
is, by construction, an extension of ΦT : in particular (8.24) holds and 
ΦT (1) =
ΦT (1) = I. The extension is continuous because ||
ΦT ( f )|| ≤|| f ||∞for any f ∈
Mb(σ(T )), in fact:
||
ΦT ( f )|| = || f (T, T ∗)|| = || f (T, T ∗)′∗|| = || f (T, T ∗)′|| ≤|| f ||∞.
As 
ΦT extends the algebra homomorphism ΦT , to prove 
ΦT is an algebra homomor-
phism it sufﬁces to show 
ΦT ( f · g) = 
ΦT ( f )
ΦT (g) when f, g ∈Mb(σ(T )). If the
two maps belong in C(σ(T )), the claim is true by Proposition 8.37 above. Suppose
f, g ∈C(σ(T )). Then

σ(T )
f · g dμx,y = (x|
ΦT ( f · g)y) = (x|
ΦT ( f )
ΦT (g)y) =

σ(T)
f dμx,
ΦT (g)y .
The aforementioned theorem of Riesz on complex measures implies that dμx,
ΦT (g)y
coincides with g dμx,y. Hence, if f ∈Mb(σ(T )),

σ(T )
f · g dμx,y =

with 
ΦT on C(σ(T )). Given x, y ∈H, the map

where E is an arbitrary Borel set in σ(T ) and χE its characteristic function, is a
complex measure on σ(T ). In fact νx,y(∅) = (x|Ψ (0)y) = 0; moreover, if {Sk}k∈N

νx,y(Sk)
holds irrespective of the arrangement of the terms, and the series converges absolutely
(Theorem1.83). This means νx,y is a complex measure.
Bearing in mind the linearity of both Ψ and the inner product, plus the deﬁnition
of integral of a simple map, we easily see

σ(T )
s dνx,y = (x|Ψ (s)y)
for any simple map s ∈S(σ(T )). If f ∈Mb(σ(T )) and {sn} ⊂S(σ(T )) converges
uniformly to f (the sequence exists by Proposition 7.49(b)), then the continuity of
Ψ in norm || ||∞and dominated convergence relative to |νx,yS| imply
(x|Ψ ( f )y) =

ΦT ( f ) for any
f ∈Mb(σ(T)), for νx,y = μx,y.
(b). We only need to prove (iii), (v) and (vi), because the rest were shown in part (a).
Property (iii) holds when f ∈C(σ(T )), as we know from Proposition 8.37(b). If

for any vectors x, y ∈H and any f ∈C(σ(T )). Riesz’s Theorem2.52 on the

ΦT ( f )A =

ΦT ( f ) if f ∈Mb(σ(T )).
Let us prove (v). Take a sequence { fn}n∈N ⊂Mb(σ(T )) that is bounded (in
absolute value) by K > 0 and that converges to f : σ(T ) →C. Therefore || f ||∞≤
K and f is measurable, forcing f ∈Mb(σ(T )). Given x, y ∈H and using (iv) in
(b),

The last terms can be written as

| f −fn|2 hd|μx,x| ,
where |μx,x| is the positive measure (the total variation of Remark1.82(2)) associated
the real (signed) measure μx,x, and h is a measurable function of constant modulus
1 (Theorem1.87). (Actually, we saw in part (a) that μx,x is a positive real measure,
so |μx,x| = μx,x and h = 1.) Because
|μx,x|(σ(T )) < +∞,
the dominated convergence theorem implies |h|| f −fn|2 converges to 0 in L1(σ(T ),
|μx,x|). Hence as n →+∞, ||(
ΦT ( fn) −
ΦT ( f ))x||2 →0 for any x ∈H.
Eventually, let us prove (vi). The proof is easy and follows from Theorem8.25(iii),
but here is an alternative argument. If Mb(σ(T )) ∋f ≥0, then f = g2 where
0 ≤g ∈Mb(σ(T )). By (a), 
ΦT ( f ) = 
ΦT (g · g) = 
ΦT (g)
ΦT (g). Moreover,

ΦT (g)∗= 
ΦT (g) = 
ΦT (g) (by (iv)), so 
ΦT (g · g) = 
ΦT (g)∗
ΦT (g). The right-hand

Remark 8.40 The spectral decomposition theorem, proved later, is in some sense
a way to interpret the operator f (T, T ∗) in terms of an integral of f with respect
to an operator-valued measure: integrating bounded measurable functions produces,
instead of numbers, operators. The version of the spectral decomposition theorem
presented in this chapter states that there is always such a measure, for any bounded
normal operator.
■
8.3
Projector-Valued Measures (PVMs)
In this section we introduce projector-valued measures (PVMs), also called spec-
tral measures. They are the central tool to state spectral theorems, and represent a
generalisation of the notion of measure on a measurable space (X, Σ(X)). Now the
measure’s range is no longer contained in R. Rather, it is a subset of orthogonal
projectors L (H) in a Hilbert space H:
Σ(X) ∋E →P(E) ∈L (H) ,
using which we will be able to integrate functions to obtain operators. We will see,
in particular, that the homomorphism 
ΦT associated to a bounded normal operator
T , studied in the previous section, is nothing but an integral with respect to a PVM
generated by T :

ΦT ( f ) =

σ(T )
f (x)d P(T )(x) ,
where X := σ(T ) ⊂C is viewed as a second-countable topological space equipped
with the topology induced from R2, and Σ(X) is the associated Borel σ-algebra
B(σ(T )).
Projector-valued measures made their appearance already in Chap.7 (Deﬁnition
7.46), in the special situation where the σ-algebra of the PVM was the Borel σ-
algebra B(R). A quantum observable, in the sense of the previous chapter, is a
special spectral measure, by virtue of Proposition 7.44. In that case the operator to
which such a PVM is attached is not just normal, but self-adjoint as well.
8.3.1
Spectral Measures, or PVMs
We remind that for T,U ∈B(H) on a Hilbert space H, the writing T ≥U means
(x|T x) ≥(x|Ux) for any x ∈H (see Deﬁnition 3.56(f) and the ensuing comments).
Deﬁnition 8.41 (Spectral measure) Let H be a Hilbert space and (X, Σ(X)) a mea-
surable space. One calls P : Σ(X) →B(H) a spectral measure on X, or projector-
valued measure on X (PVM), if the following requisites are satisﬁed.

432

Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
(a) P(B) ≥0 for any B ∈Σ(X);
(b) P(B)P(B′) = P(B ∩B′) for any B, B′ ∈Σ(X);
(c) P(X) = I;
(d) if {Bn}n∈N ⊂Σ(X), with Bn ∩Bm = ∅, n ̸= m:
s-
+∞

n=0
P(Bn) = P(∪n∈NBn) .
Remark 8.42 Notice that (c) and (d) imply P(∅) = 0.
■
A relevant deﬁnition is that of support of a PVM in the special case where X is a
topological space and Σ(X) is the Borel σ-algebra B(X).
Deﬁnition 8.43 Specialising Deﬁnition 8.41 to the case of a PVM P : B(X) →
B(H) deﬁned on the Borel σ-algebra B(X) of a topological space (X, T ), the
support of P is the closed set
supp(P) := X \

A∈T ,P(A)=0
A .
When X = Rn or Cn with the standard topology, such P is called bounded if
supp(P) is bounded.
The next proposition treats the basic properties of PVMs. In particular, as the name
PVM itself suggests, every P(E) is an orthogonal projector onto the Hilbert space H.
Proposition 8.44 Retaining Deﬁnition 8.41, the following facts hold.
(a) P(B) is an orthogonal projector for any B ∈Σ(X).
Keeping (c) and (d), condition (a) and (b) in Deﬁnition 8.41 may be replaced by the
equivalent requirement that P(B) is an orthogonal projector if B ∈Σ(X).
(b) P is monotone: C ⊂B ⇒P(C) ≤P(B), for all B, C ∈Σ(X).
(c) P is sub-additive: if Bn ∈Σ(X), n ∈N, then
(x |P (∪n∈NBn) x) ≤

n∈N
(x|P(Bn)x) for any x ∈H.
(d) Assume Σ(X) := B(X) for some topological space (X, T ), and that at least
one of the following conditions is true:
1. (X, T ) is second-countable;
2. (X, T ) is Hausdorff, locally compact, and the positive Borel measure B(X) ∋
E →(x|P(E)x) is inner regular for every x ∈H;
then P is concentrated on supp(P), i.e.
P(B) = P(B ∩supp(P)) for B ∈B(X).
In particular P(supp(P)) = I.

8.3 Projector-Valued Measures (PVMs)
433
Proof (a) The operators P(B) are idempotent, P(B)P(B) = P(B ∩B) = P(B),
by Deﬁnition 8.41(b), and self-adjoint because bounded and positive (by Deﬁnition
8.41(a)), so they are orthogonal projectors. We claim that if (c) and (d) in deﬁnition
8.41 hold, and every P(B) is an orthogonal projector, then also (a) and (b) hold in
Deﬁnition 8.41. Part (a) is trivial, for any P(E) is an orthogonal projector, hence
positive. By part (d), if E1, E2 ∈Σ(X) and E1 ∩E2 = ∅then P(E1 ∪E2) =
P(E1) + P(E2). Multiplying by P(E1 ∪E2) = P(E1) + P(E2), and recalling
we are using (idempotent) projectors, gives P(E1)P(E2) + P(E2)P(E1) = 0
and so P(E1)P(E2) = −P(E2)P(E1). Applying now P(E1) and recalling that
P(E1)P(E2) = −P(E2)P(E1), we also ﬁnd P(E1)P(E2) = P(E2)P(E1). There-
fore P(E1)P(E2) = 0 if E1∩E2 = ∅. Now set C = B∩B′, E1 = B\C, E2 = B′\C
for B, B′ ∈Σ(X). Remember E1 ∩E2 = E1 ∩C = E2 ∩C = ∅. Then
P(B)P(B′) = (P(E1) + P(C))(P(E2) + P(C)) = P(C)P(C) = P(C) = P(B ∩B′)
i.e. property (b) in 8.41.
(b) B = C ∪(B \ C) and C ∩(B \ C) = ∅so by Deﬁnition 8.41(d) it follows that
P(B) = P(C) + P(B \ C). But P(B \ C) ≥0, so P(C) ≤P(B).
(c) Deﬁne B := ∪n∈NBn and the sequence {Cn}n∈N, with C0 := B0, C1 := B1 \
B0, C2 := B2 \ (B0 ∪B1) and so on. Clearly Ck ∩Ch = ∅if h ̸= k and B =
∪n∈NCn. By Deﬁnition 8.41(d), then, P(B)x = +∞
n=0 P(Ck)x and so (x|P(B)x) =
+∞
n=0(x|P(Ck)x). Since Ck ⊂Bk for any k ∈N, by monotonicity (x|P(Ck)x) ≤
(x|P(Bk)x), i.e.
(x|P(B)x) ≤
+∞

n=0
(x|P(Bk)x) .
(d) P(supp(P)) = I is obviously equivalent to P(A) = 0, where A := X\supp(P).
To prove P(A) = 0 under hypothesis (1), notice that by deﬁnition A is the union of
open sets with null spectral measure. As X is second-countable, Lindelöf’s lemma
(Theorem1.8) says we can extract a countable subcovering A = ∪n∈N An, with
P(An) = 0 for any n ∈N. Using sub-additivity, for any x ∈H,
0 ≤||P(A)x||2 = (P(A)x|P(A)x) = (x|P(A)x) ≤

n∈N
(x|P(An)x) = 0 ,
hence P(A) = 0. If, instead, hypothesis (2) holds, consider the inner-regular Borel
measure B(X) ∋E →μx(E) := (x|P(E)x). If O ⊂X is open and P(O) = 0,
then (x|P(O)x) = ||P(O)x||2 = 0 for every x ∈H. Hence the union A :=
X\supp(P) of all such O satisﬁes ||P(A)x||2 = μx(A) = 0 by Proposition 1.45(ii),
so P (X \ supp(P)) = 0 since x is arbitrary.
With A deﬁned as above, decomposing B = (B ∩supp(P))∪(B ∩A), Deﬁnition
8.41(d) in fact gives P(B) = P(B ∩supp(P)) + P(B ∩A), and monotonicity
0 ≤(x|P(B ∩A)x) ≤(x|P(A)x) = 0. In summary, since x is arbitrary, P(B) =
P(B ∩supp(P)), as required.
⊓⊔

Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
Another related and useful deﬁnition is the following.
Deﬁnition 8.45 If P : Σ(X) →B(H) is a PVM, a measurable function f : X →C
is called essentially bounded for P when
P({x ∈X | | f (x)| ≥M}) = 0 for some M < +∞.
(8.32)
If f is essentially bounded, the greatest lower bound || f ||(P)
∞on the set of numbers
M ≥0 satisfying (8.32) is called essential (semi)norm of f in P.
Remarks 8.46 (1) Let f : X →C be measurable. If Proposition 8.44(d) holds, then
P is concentrated on supp(P). Hence the ﬁrst inequality below is easy to prove:
|| f ||(P)
∞≤|| f ↾supp(P) ||∞≤|| f ||∞.
(8.33)
(the second one is obvious). Equation (8.33) holds trivially when one among || f ||(P)
∞,
|| f ↾supp(P) ||∞, || f ||∞is +∞.
(2) The set of measurable functions that are essentially bounded for P is a vector
space, and || ||(P)
∞is a seminorm on it.

8.3.2
Integrating Bounded Measurable Functions in a PVM
We pass now to deﬁne a procedure to integrate bounded measurable functions with
respect to a PVM.
Recall that given a space X with a σ-algebra Σ, a (complex-valued) map s : X →
C, measurable for Σ, is called simple when its range is ﬁnite.
Notation 8.47 If X is a measurable space, S(X) denotes the vector space of complex-
valued simple functions on X, relative to the σ-algebra Σ(X).
■
Let a PVM be given on X, with values in B(H) for some Hilbert space H. Consider
a map s ∈S(X). We can always write it, for suitable ci ∈C and I ﬁnite, as follows:
s =

i∈I
ciχEi .
(8.34)
As, by deﬁnition, the range of a simple function consists of ﬁnitely many distinct
values, the expression above is uniquely determined by s once we require the mea-
surable sets Ei to be pairwise disjoint, and that the complex numbers ci are distinct.
We deﬁne the integral of s with respect to P (or in P) as the operator in B(H):

X
s(x) d P(x) :=

i∈I
ci P(Ei) .
(8.35)

8.3 Projector-Valued Measures (PVMs)
435
Remark 8.48 If we do not insist the above ci be distinct, there are several ways to
write s as a linear combination of characteristic functions of disjoint measurable sets.
Using the same argument as for an ordinary measure it is easy to prove, however,
that the integral of s does not depend on the particular representation of s chosen. ■
The mapping
I : S(X) ∋s →

X
s(x) d P(x) ∈B(X) ,
(8.36)
is linear, i.e. I ∈L(S(X), B(H)), as the previous remark easily implies. Since
S(X) and B(H) are normed spaces, L(S(X), B(H)) is equipped with the operator
norm. Then I turns out to be a bounded operator for this norm. Let us prove this
fact, and consider s ∈S(X) of the form (8.34). As the Ek are pairwise disjoint,
P(E j)P(Ei) = P(E j ∩Ei) = 0 if i ̸= j or P(E j)P(Ei) = P(Ei) if i = j. If
x ∈H
||I(s)x||2 = (I(s)x|I(s)x) =

ity

i∈I ′
(x|P(Ei)x) ≤(x|P(∪i∈I ′ Ei)x) ≤(x|P(X)x) = (x|x) = ||x||2 .
But I ′ isﬁnite,sotrivially||s||P
∞= supi∈I ′ |ci|,andhence||I(s)x||2 ≤||x||2(||s||P
∞)2.
Taking the least upper bound over unit vectors x ∈H:
||I(s)|| ≤||s||(P)
∞.
But ||s||(P)
∞coincides with one of the values of |s|, say |ck| if we choose x ∈P(Ek)(H)
(̸= {0} by construction). Hence x = P(Ek)x implies
I(s)x =

i∈I ′
ci P(Ei)x =

i∈I ′
ci P(Ei)P(Ek)x = ck P(Ek)x = ckx .
So choosing x with ||x|| = 1 we obtain ||I(s)x|| = ||s||(P)
∞. Therefore I is certainly
continuous on S(X) ⊂Mb(X) in norm || ||∞, by what we have just proved and by
(8.33):
||I(s)|| = ||s||(P)
∞≤||s||∞
(8.37)
This settled, we can deﬁne integrals of bounded measurable functions, by prolong-
ing I by linearity and continuity to the whole Banach space Mb(X) of bounded
measurable maps f : X →C. The space Mb(X) contains S(X) as dense subspace

436
8
Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
for the norm || ||∞, by Proposition 7.49(b). The operator I : S(X) →B(H) is
continuous. By Proposition 2.47 there exists one, and only one, bounded operator
Mb(X) →B(H) extending I.
Deﬁnition 8.49 Let (X, Σ(X)) a measurable space, H a Hilbert space and P :
Σ(X) →B(H) a PVM.
(a) The unique bounded extension I : Mb(X) →B(H) of the operator I : S(X) →
B(H) (cf. (8.35)–(8.36)) is called integral operator in P.
(b) For any f ∈Mb(X):

X
f (x) d P(x) := I( f )
is the integral of f with respect to the projector-valued measure P.
(c) Let f : X →C be measurable, not necessarily bounded. If f ↾E∈Mb(E) with
E ⊂Σ(X), we deﬁne:

E
f (x) d P(x) :=

X
χE(x) f (x) d P(x) .
If g ∈Mb(E), with E ⊂Σ(X), we set:

E
g(x) d P(x) :=

X
g0(x) d P(x) ,
where g0(x) := g(x) if x ∈E, or g0(x) := 0 if x /∈E.
Remark 8.50 Let us concentrate on the topological case: take X a topological space,
Σ(X) = B(X) and suppose hypotheses (1) or (2) in Proposition 8.44(d) are valid.
If P is a spectral measure on X and supp(P) ̸= X, we can restrict P to a spectral
measure P ↾supp(P) on supp(P) (with induced topology), by deﬁning P ↾supp(P)
(E) := P(E) for any measurable set E ⊂B(supp(P)). The fact that P↾supp(P) is
a PVM is immediate using Proposition 8.44, especially part (d). From (d) we have,
for any s ∈S(X),

X
sd P =

supp(P)
sd P =

supp(P)
s↾supp(P) d P↾supp(P) ,
where the second integral is understood in the sense of Deﬁnition 8.49(c). If S(X) ∋
sn →f in norm || ||∞, then S(X) ∋sn ↾supp(P)→f ↾supp(P) in the same norm.
Therefore the deﬁnition of integral of f ∈Mb(X) with respect to P tells that

X
f d P =

supp(P)
f d P =

supp(P)
f ↾supp(P) d P↾supp(P)
for any f ∈Mb(X).

8.3 Projector-Valued Measures (PVMs)

Examples 8.51
(1) Let us see a concrete example lest the procedure seem too abstract. The (gener-
alisation of this) example actually covers all possibilities, as we shall explain.
Consider the Hilbert space H = L2(X, μ), where X is a topological space and μ
a positive σ-additive measure on the Borel σ-algebra of X. For any ψ ∈L2(X, μ)
and E ∈B(X), set
(P(E)ψ)(x) := χE(x)ψ(x) ,
for almost every x ∈X .
(8.39)
The map B(X) ∋E →P(E) easily deﬁnes a spectral measure on L2(X, μ). We
want to understand what the operators

X f (x) d P(x) look like, for any map of
Mb(X).
If ψ ∈L2(X, μ) and f ∈Mb(X), then f ·ψ ∈L2(X, μ), where · is the pointwise
product of maps, for:

X
| f (x)ψ(x)|2 dμ(x) ≤|| f ||2
∞

X
|ψ(x)|2 dμ(x) < +∞.
In particular, we proved
|| f · ψ|| ≤|| f ||∞||ψ||
if f ∈Mb(X) and ψ ∈L2(X, μ). Consequently:
if { fn}n∈N ⊂Mb(X) and
fn →f ∈Mb(X) in norm || ||∞, as n →+∞, then
also fn · ψ →f · ψ in L2(X, μ).
Moreover, if s ∈S(X), the operator

X s(x) d P(x) can be made explicit using
(8.39) and (8.35): for any ψ ∈L2(X), in fact,

X
s(y) d P(y)ψ

(x) = s(x)ψ(x) .
Hence if {sn} ⊂S(X) converges uniformly to f ∈Mb(X) (by Proposition 7.49(b)
such a sequence exists for any f ∈Mb(X)), we have
sn · ψ =

X
sn(x) d P(x)ψ →

X
f (x) d P(x)ψ
as n →+∞, by the deﬁnition of integral via the continuous prolongationI of I. On
the other hand we saw at the beginning that under our assumptions (with fn := sn)
we have sn · ψ →f · ψ in L2(X), as n →+∞, so

X
f (y) d P(y)ψ

(x) = f (x)ψ(x)
for almost every x ∈X,
(8.40)
for any f ∈Mb(X), ψ ∈L2(X, μ). Equation (8.40) gives the explicit form of the
integral operator of f with respect to the PVM of (8.39).

Regarding the supports, we have supp(P) = supp(μ) (P(E) = 0 is equivalent
to

E |ψ|2dμ = 0 for every ψ ∈L2(X, μ) so that, taking ψ = χE, P(E) = 0 iff
μ(E) = 0). If X is second countable then P is concentrated on supp(P), because
hypothesis (1) in Proposition 8.44(d) holds. Even if X is not second countable, but
Hausdorff and locally compact, and μ is inner continuous, then both P and μ are
concentrated on their respective supports, as follows from Proposition 1.45(ii).
(2)InthesecondexampleweconsideraHilbertbasis N ofa(generallynon-separable)
Hilbert space H, and deﬁne Σ(N) to be the power set of N. Actually this σ-algebra
can be viewed as a Borel σ-algebra if we endow N with the discrete topology
of the power set of N, for which singlets are open and the associated Borel σ-
algebra is the topology itself. This topology is Hausdorff and locally compact, and
furthermore second countable if H is separable. If E ⊂N, consider the closed
subspace HE := < {z}z∈E >. The orthogonal projector onto it is (cf. Proposition
3.64(d))
P(E)x :=

z∈E
(z|x)z ,
x ∈H
E being a basis of HE. It is easy to check P : B(N) ∋E →P(E) is a PVM. One
can also prove, for any f : N →C bounded and x ∈H

N
f (z) d P(z)x =

z∈N
f (z) (z|x) z .
(8.41)
The proof can be obtained using example (1), because (Theorem3.28) H and
L2(N, μ) are isomorphic Hilbert spaces under the surjective isometry U : H →
L2(N, μ) sending x ∈H to the map z →ψx(z) := (z|x), where μ is the count-
ing measure of N. Indeed, Q(E) := U P(E)U −1 is the operator in L2(N, μ) that
multiplies by the characteristic function of E: we obtain thus a spectral measure
Q : B(N) ∋E →Q(E) of the kind of example (1). Using the integral of a map
f ∈Mb(X) deﬁned by simple integrals, for which

N
s(z) dQ(z) =

i
ci Q(Ei) = U

i
ci P(Ei)U −1 = U

N
s(z) d P(z)U −1 ,
we obtain

N
f (z) dQ(z) = U

N
f (z) d P(z)U −1 ,
(8.42)
by continuity of the composite in B(H). Equation (8.40) implies

N
f (z) dQ(z)ψ = f · ψ .
(8.43)

8.3 Projector-Valued Measures (PVMs)
439
From (8.42) and (8.43), then

N
f (z) d P(z)φ = U −1 f · Uφ =

z∈N
f (z) (z|φ) z ,
where we used the deﬁnition of U (cf. Theorem3.28):
U : H ∋φ →{(z|φ)}z∈N ∈L2(N, μ)
and the inverse:
U −1 : L2(N, μ) ∋{αz}z∈N →

z∈N
αzz ∈H .
Altogether, we proved that

N
f (z) d P(z)x =

z∈N
f (z) (z|x) z
for x ∈H as required.
Concerning supp(P), it is clear that it coincides with N itself, since every subset
E ⊂N satisﬁes P(E) ̸= 0, unless E = ∅.
(3) The third example generalises the previous one. Consider a set X equipped with
a σ-algebra Σ in which every singlet {x}, x ∈X, belongs to Σ(X). Let us deﬁne a
family of orthogonal projectors 0 ̸= Pλ : H →H on the Hilbert space H, for any
λ ∈X. In order to have a PVM on B(X) we impose three conditions:
(a) PλPμ = 0, for λ, μ ∈X, λ ̸= μ;
(b) 
λ∈X ||Pλψ||2 < +∞, for any ψ ∈H;
(c) 
λ∈X Pλψ = ψ , for any ψ ∈H.
Condition (b) implies that only countably many (at most, see Proposition 3.21) ele-
ments Pλψ are non-zero, even if X is not countable; by (a), the vectors Pλψ and
Pμψ are orthogonal if λ ̸= μ, so Lemma 3.25 guarantees that the sum of (c) is well
deﬁned and may be rearranged at will.
That (a), (b), (c) hold is proved by exhibiting a family that satisﬁes them. The
simplest case is given by the projectors P({z}), z ∈N, of example (2) when X = N
is a Hilbert basis. An instance where X is not a basis is the following. Take a self-
adjoint compact operator T , set X = σp(T ) ⊂R (with induced topology and the
associated Borel σ-algebra) and deﬁne Pλ, λ ∈σp(T ), to be the orthogonal projector
onto the λ-eigenspace. By Theorems 4.19 and 4.20 conditions (a), (b) and (c) follow.
With these assumptions, P : Σ(X) →B(H), where
P(E)ψ =

λ∈E
Pλψ ,
(8.44)

440
8
Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
for any E ⊂Σ(X) and any ψ ∈H, is a PVM on H. The sum 
λ∈E Pλψ always
exists in H, for any ψ ∈H, and does not depend on the ordering: this fact is a
consequence of condition (b), because of lemma 3.25. Now we wish to prove

X
f (x) d P(x)ψ =

x∈X
f (x)Pxψ
(8.45)
for any f ∈Mb(X) and ψ ∈H. The right-hand side is well deﬁned and can be
rearranged by Lemma 3.25, because for any ψ ∈H:

x∈X
|| f (x)Pxψ||2 ≤|| f ||2
∞

x∈X
||Pxψ||2 = || f ||2
∞

x∈X
(Pxψ|Pxψ) = || f ||2

ψ


x∈X
Pxψ

= || f ||2
∞(ψ|ψ) = || f ||2
∞||ψ||2 ,
the last equality coming from (c). If s ∈S(X) is simple, using (8.44) and the deﬁnition
of integral, we have

X
s(x) d P(x)ψ =

i
ci P(Ei)ψ =

i

x∈Ei
s(x)Pxψ =

x∈X
s(x)Pxψ ,
(8.46)
for any ψ ∈H. Note that in the second equality we used that s(x) = 
i ciχEi
implies ci = s(x) for all x ∈Ei.
If {sn} ⊂S(X) and sn →f ∈Mb(X) uniformly, then for any ψ ∈H:

X
f (x) d P(x)ψ −

X
sn(x) d P(x)ψ →0 ,
(8.47)
as n →+∞, by deﬁnition of integral of bounded measurable maps. At the same
time, (8.46) and condition (a) give



x∈X
f (x) Pxψ −

X
sn(x) d P(x)ψ

=

x∈X
| f (x) −sn(x)|2||Pxψ||2 ≤|| f −sn||2
∞||ψ||2 .
The last term goes to zero as n →+∞. By (8.47) and uniqueness of limits in H,

x∈X
f (x) Pxψ =

X
f (x) d P(x)ψ ,
for any ψ ∈H, so (8.45) holds.

8.3.3
Properties of Operators Obtained Integrating Bounded
Maps with Respect to PVMs
In this section we examine the properties of the integral operator, separating them in
two groups. The ﬁrst theorem establishes basic features.
Theorem 8.52 Let (X, Σ(X)) a measurable space, (H, ( | )) a Hilbert space and
P : Σ(X) →B(H) a PVM.
(a) For any f ∈Mb(X),



X
f (x) d P(x)

 = || f ||(P)
∞.
(8.48)
(b) The integral operator with respect to P is positive:

X
f (x) d P(x) ≥0 if 0 ≤f ∈Mb(X) .
(c) For any ψ, φ ∈H, the map
μψ,φ : B(X) ∋E →

ψ


X
χE d P(x)φ

satisﬁes the following properties:
(i) μψ,φ is a complex measure on X, called complex spectral measure associated
to ψ and φ,
(ii) if ψ = φ, then μψ := μψ,ψ is a ﬁnite positive measure on X, called (positive)
spectral measure associated to ψ,
(iii) μψ,φ(X) = (ψ|φ), and in particular μψ(X) = ||ψ||2,
(iv) for any f ∈Mb(X):

ψ


X
f (x) d P(x)φ

=

X
f (x) dμψ,φ(x) ,
(8.49)
(v) if X is a topological space, Σ(X) = B(X) and condition (1) or (2) of Propo-
sition 8.44(d) is valid, then
supp(μψ,φ) ⊂supp(P) and supp(μψ) ⊂supp(P) ,
and furthermore
supp(P) =

ψ∈H
supp(μψ) .
(8.50)
(d) If f ∈Mb(X),

X f (x)d P(x) commutes with every operator B ∈B(H) such
that P(E)B = B P(E) for any E ∈Σ(X).

Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
Proof (a) Consider a sequence of simple functions sn converging to f in norm || ||∞.
Then ||sn −f ||(P)
∞≤||sn −f ||∞→0, so |||sn||(P)
∞−|| f ||(P)
∞| ≤||sn −f ||(P)
∞implies
||sn||(P)
∞
→|| f ||(P)
∞. We also know ||

X snd P|| = ||sn||(P)
∞by (8.37). From the
deﬁnition of integral of bounded maps ||

X snd P|| →||

X f d P||, hence ||sn||(P)
∞→
|| f ||(P)
∞= ||

X f d P||, proving (8.48).
(b) Using Proposition 7.49(c) if 0 ≤f ∈Mb(X) there is a sequence of simple
functions {sn}n∈N, 0 ≤sn ≤sn+1 ≤f for any n, that converges uniformly to f .
Keeping in mind the deﬁnition of integral in P, and that uniform convergence implies
weak convergence, we have (ψ|

X snd Pψ) →(ψ|

X f d Pψ), as n →+∞, for
any ψ ∈H. For the positivity of

X f d P it sufﬁces to show (ψ|

X snd Pψ) ≥0 for
any n. Directly from (8.35) we ﬁnd


snd P ψ

=

i∈In
c(n)
i

ψ
P(E(n)


≥0 ,
because every orthogonal projector is positive and the numbers c(n)
i
are non-negative
for sn ≥0.
(c) By (8.35),
μψ,φ(E) =

ψ


X
χE(x) d P(x)φ

= (ψ|1 · P(E)φ) = (ψ|P(E)φ) ,
(8.51)
and (ψ|P(E)ψ) ≥0. Then Deﬁnition 8.41(d) and the inner product’s continuity
imply μψ,φ is a complex measure on Σ(X). Moreover, parts (d) and (a) in Deﬁnition
8.41 say that if ψ = φ, μψ is a positive, σ-additive, ﬁnite measure on Σ(X). At last
Deﬁnition 8.41(c) forces μψ,φ(X) = (ψ|φ), in particular μψ(X) = (ψ|ψ) = ||ψ||2.
As μψ and |μψ,φ| are ﬁnite measures, their integral is continuous in norm || ||∞on
Mb(X). (In fact, for any f ∈Mb(X),


X
f (x) dμψ,φ(x)
 ≤

X
| f (x)| d|μψ,φ(x)| ≤|| f ||∞|μψ,φ|(X) ,
whence the integral’s continuity in sup norm.)
If sn ∈S(X), using (8.51) and (8.35) we immediately see

ψ


X
sn(x) d P(x)φ

=

X
sn(x) dμψ,φ(x) .
If now f ∈Mb(X) and {sn}n∈N ⊂S(X) converges to f uniformly, as n →+∞
(cf. Proposition 7.49(b)), we can use the continuity of the inner product and of the
integral associated to μψ,φ (uniform convergence) to obtain

X

Let us prove (v), or equivalently, X \ supp(μψ,φ) ⊃X \ supp(P). Take x ∈X \
supp(P), so that there is an open set A ⊂X with x ∈A and P(A) = 0. By
monotonicity P(B) = 0 if B(X) ∋B ⊂A, and therefore
μψ,φ(B) =


ψ


X
χB(x) d P(x)φ

= (ψ|P(B)φ) = 0 .
By the deﬁnition of total variation (Remark 1.82(2)) |μψ,φ|(A) = 0, so x ∈X \
supp(μψ,φ). The case μψ is analogous.
Let us prove (8.50). If x ∈X \ supp(P), there exists an open set O ∋x with
P(O) = 0 and therefore μψ(O) = ||P(O)ψ||2 = 0 for every ψ ∈H. As a conse-
quence X \ supp(P) ⊂∩ψ∈HX \ supp(μψ), namely supp(P) ⊃∪ψ∈Hsupp(μψ)
and also, since supp(P) is closed, supp(P) ⊃∪ψ∈Hsupp(μψ). Let us prove
the converse inclusion. If x ∈supp(P) and O ∋x is open, then P(O) ̸= 0
(otherwise x ∈X \ supp(P)). Therefore, there must exist ψO ∈H such that
μψO(O) = ||P(O)ψO||2 ̸= 0. Consequently O ∩supp(μψO) ̸= ∅due to Proposi-
tion 1.45. Taking xO ∈O ∩supp(μψO) we also have xO ∈O ∩∪ψ∈Hsupp(μψ).
In summary, if x ∈supp(P), for every open set O ∋x there is xO ∈O such that
xO ∈∪ψ∈Hsupp(μψ). This is equivalent to saying x ∈∪ψ∈Hsupp(μψ), proving
supp(P) ⊂∪ψ∈Hsupp(μψ), as we wanted.
(d) The claim is obvious when f is simple, and extends by continuity to any f .
⊓⊔
Remarks 8.53 (1) It must be said that if we want the positive measures μψ, deﬁned
on Σ(X) := B(X) when X is a topological space, to be proper Borel measures, then
we should also demand X be Hausdorff and locally compact (Deﬁnition 1.42(iv)).
In concrete situations, like when we use PVMs for the spectral expansion of an
operator, X is always (a subset of) R or R2, so the extra assumptions hold. In such
case the measures μψ are also regular, see Remark8.46(3), so that P is concentrated
on supp(P) by Proposition 8.44(d)(2). The same result follows from Proposition
8.44(d)(1), since the standard topology of Rn is second countable.
(2) A useful remark is that the complex measure μψ,φ decomposes as complex linear
combination of 4 positive ﬁnite measures μχ. Since μψ,φ(E) = (ψ|P(E)φ) =
(P(E)ψ|P(E)φ), by the polarisation formula (3.4) we obtain:
μψ,φ(E) = μψ+φ(E) −μψ−φ(E) −iμψ+iφ(E) + iμψ−iφ(E) for any E ∈Σ(X).
■
The next theorem establishes the primary feature of a PVM: it gives rise to an
isometric ∗-homomorphism of C∗-algebras Mb(X) →B(H). In the topological case,
when X = R2 and Σ(X) = B(R2), this ∗-homomorphism extends the representation

ΦT of Theorem8.39, provided we deﬁne the normal operator T suitably.

Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
This will be a crucial point in the spectral theorem, proved immediately after.
Theorem 8.54 Let H be a Hilbert space, (X, Σ(X)) a measurable space and P :
Σ(X) →B(H) a projector-valued measure.
(a) The integral operator:
I : Mb(X) ∋f →

X
f (x)d P(x) ∈B(H)
is a (continuous) representation on H of the unital C∗-algebra Mb(X). Equivalently:
beside (8.48) the following hold:
(i) if 1 is the constant map on X,

X
1 d P(x) = I ,
(ii) for any f, g ∈Mb(X), α, β ∈C,

X
(αf (x) + βg(x)) d P(x) = α

X
f (x)d P(x) + β

(iii) for any f, g ∈Mb(X),

X
f (x) d P(x)

X
g(x) d P(x) =

X
f (x)g(x) d P(x) ,
(iv) for any f ∈Mb(X),

X
f (x) d P(x) =

X
f (x)d P(x)

.
(b) If ψ ∈H and f ∈Mb(X) then



X
f (x) d P(x)ψ


2
=

X
| f (x)|2 dμψ(x) .
(c) If { fn}n∈N ⊂Mb(X) is bounded and converges to f : X →C pointwise, the
integral of f in the spectral measure P exists and equals:

X
f (x) d P(x) = s- lim
n→+∞

X
fn(x) d P(x) .
(d) If X = R2 with the Euclidean topology, Σ(X) := B(R2), and supp(P) is
bounded, then
supp(P) = σ(T ) ,

8.3 Projector-Valued Measures (PVMs)
445
where σ(T ) is viewed as subset in R2, and we deﬁned the normal operator:
T :=

supp(P)
z d P(x, y) ,
with z denoting the map R2 ∋(x, y) →z := x + iy.
In this case let us identify Mb(σ(T )) with the closed subspace of Mb(R2) of maps
vanishing outside the compact set σ(T ). Then the restriction
I↾Mb(σ(T )): Mb(σ(T )) →B(H)
coincides with the representation 
ΦT of the normal operator T of Theorem8.39, and
we may write
f (T, T ∗) =

σ(T )
f (x, y)d P(x, y) ,
f ∈Mb(σ(T )),
where f (T, T ∗) := 
ΦT ( f ).
Proof of Theorem 8.54. (a) The only facts that are not entirely trivial are (iii) and (iv),
so let us begin with the former. Choose two sequences of simple functions {sn} and
{tm} that converge uniformly to f and g respectively. A direct computations shows

X
sn(x) d P(x)

X
tm(x) d P(x) =

X
sn(x)tm(x) d P(x) .
Given m, sn · tm tends to f · tm uniformly, as n →+∞, because tm is bounded. By
continuity (in the sense of Theorem8.52(a)) and linearity of the integral, the limit as
n →+∞gives

X
f (x) d P(x)

X
tm(x) d P(x) =

X
f (x)tm(x) d P(x) ,
where we used the fact that the composite of bounded operators is continuous in
its arguments. Similarly, since f · tm tends to f · g uniformly as m →+∞, we
obtain (iii). Property (iv) is proven by choosing a sequence of simple functions {sn}
converging to f uniformly. Take ψ, φ ∈H. Directly by deﬁnition of integral of a
simple function (orthogonal projectors are self-adjoint), we have

X
sn(x) d P(x)ψ

=

ψ


X
sn(x) d P(x)φ

.
Notice sn →f uniformly, as n →+∞. Hence by continuity and linearity of the
integral (in the sense of Theorem8.52(a)), plus the continuity of the inner product,
when we take the limit as n →+∞, the above identity gives

Given the freedom in choosing ψ ∈H, (c) is proved.
(d) If supp(P) is bounded, it is compact (as closed by deﬁnition) and every con-
tinuous map on it is bounded. The mapping R2 ∋(x, y) →zχsupp(P)(x, y) ∈C is
thus bounded, so T :=

supp(P) z d P(x, y) :=

R2 zχsupp(P)(x, y) d P(x, y) is well
deﬁned and a normal operator ((ii) and (iv) in (a)) in B(H). Its residual spectrum is
in particular empty, by Proposition 8.7(c).
By deﬁnition of resolvent set, the claim is the same as asking:
C ∋λ /∈supp(P) ⇔λ ∈ρ(T ).
Let us prove λ /∈supp(P) ⇒λ ∈ρ(T ). Since R2 ∋(x, y) →z = x + iy is
bounded on supp(P), suppose λ /∈supp(P). If so, there is an open subset in R2,
A ∋(x0, y0) with x0 + iy0 = λ, such that P(A) = 0. It follows that (x, y) →
(z −λ)−1 is bounded on the closed set supp(P). Then we have the operator

of B(H). By virtue of (iii) and (i) in (a),

supp(P)

z −λ d P(x, y) = I .
Put differently, T −λI is a bijection of H so that λ ∈ρ(T ). By Theorem8.4(a)
λ ∈ρ(T).
Now we show λ ∈ρ(T ) ⇒λ /∈supp(P), and actually we shall prove the
equivalent statement: λ ∈supp(P) ⇒λ ∈σ(T ) = σp(T ) ∪σc(T ).
If λ ∈supp(P), is may happen that T −λI : H →H is not one-to-one, in which
case λ ∈σp(T ) and the proof ends. If, on the contrary, T −λI : H →H is injective
we can prove the inverse (T −λI)−1 : Ran(T −λI) →H cannot be bounded, so
λ ∈σc(T). For that it is enough to show, for λ ∈supp(P), n = 1, 2, . . ., that there
exists ψn ∈H, ψn ̸= 0, such that
||(T −λI)ψn||/||ψn|| ≤1/n .
(under our assumptions ψn = (T −λI)−1φn, for any n = 1, 2, . . ., with φn ̸= 0 so
that ψn ̸= 0. Then
1/n ≥||(T −λI)ψn||/||ψn|| = ||(T −λI)(T −λI)−1φn||/||(T −λI)−1φn|| .
In other terms, for n = 1, 2, . . ., there is φn ∈H, φn ̸= 0, such that
||(T −λI)−1φn||
||φn||
≥n .
Then (T −λI)−1 cannot be bounded, and hence λ ∈σc(T ).)
If λ ∈supp(P), any open set A ∋λ must satisfy P(A) ̸= 0. Set x0 + iy0 := λ
and consider the family of open discs Dn ⊂R2, centred at (x0, y0) and of radii
1/n, n = 1, 2, . . .. As P(Dn) ̸= 0, there exists ψn ̸= 0 with ψn ∈P(Dn)(H). In
such a case

The ﬁnal statement is an easy consequence of the uniqueness of 
ΦT , because I
restricted to Mb(σ(T )) = Mb(supp(P)) trivially satisﬁes all the conditions (see
Theorem8.39). □
It is worth to state explicitly an important elementary consequence of the theorem (a

8.4 Spectral Theorem for Normal Operators in B(H)

8.4
Spectral Theorem for Normal Operators in B(H)
At this juncture enough material has been gathered to allow to state the ﬁrst important
spectral decomposition theorem for normal operators in B(H). Later in this section
we will prove another version of the theorem that concerns a useful spectral repre-
sentation for bounded normal operators T , in terms of multiplicative operators on
certain L2 spaces built on the spectrum of T .
8.4.1
Spectral Decomposition of Normal Operators in B(H)
The spectral decomposition theorem, reversing (d) in Theorem8.54, explains how
any normal operator in B(H) can be constructed by integrating a certain PVM,
whose support is the operator’s spectrum and which is completely determined by
the operator. In view of the applications it is important to point out that the theorem
holds in particular for self-adjoint operators in B(H) and unitary operators, since
both are subclasses of normal operators.
Theorem 8.56 (Spectral decomposition of normal operators in B(H)) Let H be a
Hilbert space and T ∈B(H) a normal operator.
(a) There exists a unique bounded projector-valued measure P(T ) : B(R2) →B(H)
(R2 has the standard topology) such that:
T =

supp(P(T ))
z d P(T )(x, y) ,
(8.52)
where z is the map R2 ∋(x, y) →z := x + iy ∈C.
(a)’ If T is self-adjoint, or unitary, statement (a) can be reﬁned by replacing R2 with:
R or S1 := {(x, y) ∈R2 | x2 + y2 = 1}, respectively.
(b) P(T ) is concentrated on its support and
supp(P(T )) = σ(T ) .
In particular, for λ = x + iy ∈C (λ = x ∈R, or λ = x + iy ∈S1 respectively):
(i) λ ∈σp(T )
⇔
P(T )({λ}) ̸= 0. In this case P(T )({λ}) is the orthogonal
projector onto the λ-eigenspace of T ;
(ii) λ ∈σc(T ) ⇔P(T )({λ}) = 0, and P(T )(Aλ) ̸= 0 for any open set Aλ ⊂R2
(R or S1 respectively), Aλ ∋λ;
(iii) if λ ∈σ(T ) is isolated, then λ ∈σp(T );
(iv) if λ ∈σc(T ), then for any ε > 0 there exists φε ∈H with ||φε|| = 1 and
0 < ||T φε −λφε|| ≤ε .

(c) If f ∈Mb(σ(T )), the operator

σ(T ) f (x, y) d P(T )(x, y) commutes with every
operator in B(H) that commutes with T and T ∗.
Remarks 8.57 (1) In practice, property (iv) of (b) says that when λ ∈σc(T ), despite
T has no λ-eigenvectors (the continuous and discrete spectra are disjoint), we can
still construct non-zero vectors of constant norm that solve the characteristic equation
with arbitrary approximation.
(2) We may rephrase part (c) as follows: the
∗-subalgebra of B(H) of operators
f (T, T ∗), for f ∈Mb(σ(T )), is contained in the von Neumann algebra generated
by T , T ∗in B(H). In Theorem9.11 we will prove that this inclusion is actually an
equality, provided H is separable.
■
Proof of Theorem 8.56
(a)–(a)’–(c). Uniqueness. We begin with the spectral measure’s uniqueness. First,
observe that if P(T ) exists it must be concentrated on its support, since the standard
topology of R2 is second countable and hence (1) in Proposition 8.44(d) applies.
Next, note that if a spectral measure P satisﬁes (8.52) it must have bounded support,
since the map z is not bounded on unbounded sets and the right-hand side in (8.52) is
understood as in Deﬁnition 8.49(c). So let P, P′ be PVMs over B(R2) with bounded
support (so compact, for supp(P) is closed in R2 by deﬁnition) and such that:
T =

supp(P)
z d P(x, y) =

supp(P′)
z d P′(x, y) .
(8.53)
Using (i)–(iv) in Theorem8.54(a), this gives, for any polynomial p = p(z, z),
p(T, T ∗) =

supp(P)
p(x + iy, x −iy) d P(x, y) =

supp(P′)
p(x + iy, x −iy) d P′(x, y) ,
where the polynomial p(T, T ∗) is deﬁned in the most obvious manner, i.e. reading
multiplication as composition of operators and setting T 0 := I, (T ∗)0 := I. If
u, v ∈H are arbitrary, for any complex polynomial p = p(z, z) on R2,

supp(μu,v)
p(z, z) dμu,v(x, y) =

u


supp(P)
p(z, z) d P(x, y)v

=

u

supp(P′)
p(z, z) d P′(x, y)v

=

supp(μ′u,v)
p(z, z) dμ′
u,v(x, y) .
The two complex measures μu,v and μ′
u,v are those of Theorem8.52(c) (where u, v
were called ψ, φ). Moreover supp(μu,v), supp(μ′
u,v) are compact subsets of R2 (by
(v) Theorem8.52(c)), so there exists a compact set K ⊂R2 containing both. Let us
extend in the obvious way the measures to K, maintaining the supports intact, by
deﬁning the measure of a Borel set E in K by μu,v(E ∩supp(μu,v)), and similarly
for μ′
u,v.

8.4 Spectral Theorem for Normal Operators in B(H)
451
Since polynomials in z, z with complex coefﬁcients correspond bijectively to
complex polynomials q(x, y) in the real variables x, y (under the usual identiﬁcation
z := x + iy and z := x −iy, so p(x + iy, x −iy) = q(x, y)), we can rewrite the
above identities in terms of polynomials with complex coefﬁcients in (x, y) ∈K:

K
p(x + iy, x −iy) dμu,v(x, y) =

K
p(x + iy, x −iy) dμ′
u,v(x, y) .
By the Stone–Weierstrass Theorem(2.30), the algebra of complex polynomials
q(x, y) is dense inside C(K) for the sup norm. Therefore the algebra of complex
polynomials p(x + iy, x −iy) restricted to K is dense in C(K) for the sup norm.
Since integrals of complex measures are continuous functionals in sup norm,

K
f (x, y) dμu,v(x, y) =

K
f (x, y) dμ′
u,v(x, y) for any f ∈C(K) .
Riesz’s Theorem2.52 for complex measures ensures the two extended measures must
coincide. Consequently the yet-to-be-extended measures must have the same support
and coincide. Now by (iv) in Theorem8.52(c), for any pair of vectors u, v ∈H and
any bounded measurable g on R2 we have

u


supp(P)
g(x, y) d P(x, y)v

=

u


supp(P′)
g(x, y) d P′(x, y)v

,
i.e.

u


R2 g(x, y) d P(x, y)v

=

u


R2 g(x, y) d P′(x, y)v

.
Therefore

R2 g(x, y) d P(x, y) =

R2 g(x, y) d P′(x, y)
because u and v are arbitrary. If E is an arbitrary Borel set of R2 and we pick g = χE,
the above equation implies
P(E) =

R2 χE(x, y) d P(x, y) =

R2 χE(x, y) d P′(x, y) = P′(E) ,
proving P = P′.
Observe, furthermore, that (8.53) and Theorem8.54(d) give supp(P(T )) = σ(T ).
Uniqueness for the cases of (a)’ follows by what we have just proved, because
supp(P(T )) = σ(T ) and by (i) in Proposition 8.7(a, b).
Existence. Let us see to the existence of the spectral measure P(T ).
Consider the ∗-homomorphism 
ΦT associated to the normal operator T ∈B(H),
as of Theorem8.39. If E is a Borel set in R2, deﬁne E′ := E ∩σ(T ) whence
P(T )(E) := 
ΦT (χE′). The operator P(T )(E) is patently idempotent, for 
ΦT is

452
8
Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
a homomorphism and χE′ · χE′
= χE′. By property (vi) of Theorem8.39(b)
and the positivity of characteristic functions, P(T )(E) ≥0, so P(T )(E) is self-
adjoint. Therefore every P(T )(E) is an orthogonal projector. It is easy to check
B(R) ∋E →P(T )(E) is a PVM: P(T )(E) ≥0 we saw above. Concerning Deﬁni-
tion 8.41: (b) follows from χE′ · χF′ = χE′∩F′ and because 
ΦT is a homomorphism;
(c) descends from 
ΦT (χσ(T )) = I, which holds by deﬁnition of algebra homo-
morphism; eventually, (d) follows from (v) in Theorem8.41(b), because, pointwise,
limN→+∞
N
n=0 χE′n = χ∪n∈NE′n when the E′
n are pairwise disjoint. By construction,
supp(P(T )) is bounded because supp(P(T )) ⊂σ(T ), the latter being compact by
Theorem8.4(c).
To continue with the proof, let us remark the following fact. By the above argu-
ment, and because the integral operator of P(T ) and 
ΦT are both linear,

ΦT (s ↾σ(T )) =

supp(P(T ))
s(x, y) d P(T )(x, y) ,
for any simple function s : R2 →C. Either functional is continuous in the sup topol-
ogy ((ii) in Theorem8.39(b) and (a)), so Proposition 7.49 gives

ΦT ( f ↾σ(T )) =

supp(P(T ))
f (x, y) d P(T )(x, y) ,
(8.54)
for any f : R2 →C measurable and bounded. In particular, by (i) Theorem8.39(a)
T =

supp(P(T ))
z d P(T )(x, y) .
As far as the proof of (c) is concerned, notice that (8.54) implies that A ∈B(H)
commutes with

supp(P(T )) f (x, y)d P(T )(x, y), when A commutes with T , T ∗; that is
because A commutes with 
ΦT ( f ↾σ(T )) in consequence of (iii) in Theorem8.39(b).
(b) Let us prove the claim for the general case where T is not necessarily self-adjoint
nor unitary; these special cases are easily proved with this argument. As already said
above, P(T ) must be concentrated on its support. The fact that supp(P(T )) = σ(T )
is a straightforward consequence of Theorem8.54(d). Let us prove the equivalence
λ ∈σc(T ) ⇔P(T )({λ}) = 0 in (i). We shall write P instead of P(T ) to simplify
the notation. Let λ := x0 + iy0 be a complex number. By (iii) of Theorem8.54(a),
T P({(x0, y0)}) =

σ(T )
(x + iy)χ{(x0,y0)}(x, y) d P(x, y)
=

σ(T )
(x0 + iy0)χ{(x0,y0)}(x, y) d P(x, y) = λ

σ(T)
χ{(x0,y0)}(x, y) d P(x, y) .

8.4 Spectral Theorem for Normal Operators in B(H)
453
Hence T P({(x0, y0)}) = λP({(x0, y0)}). We conclude that P({(x0, y0)}) ̸= 0
implies λ := x0 + iy0 is an eigenvalue of T and hence λ ∈σp(T), because any
vector u ̸= 0 in the target subspace of P({(x0, y0)}) is a λ-eigenvector.
Suppose conversely λ ∈σp(T ) so that T u = λu, u ̸= 0 and λ := x0 + iy0. Then
(cf. (b) of (i) in Proposition 3.60) T ∗u = λu, T n(T ∗)mu = λnλ
mu, and by linearity
p(T, T ∗)u =

supp(P)
p(x + iy, x −iy) d P(x, y)u = p(λ, λ)u
(8.55)
for any polynomial p = p(x +iy, x −iy), because the integral deﬁnes a ∗-homomor-
phism. Every polynomial p = p(x + iy, x −iy) is also a complex polynomial q =
q(x, y) in the real variables x, y by setting q(x, y) := p(x+iy, x−iy) pointwise; the
correspondence is bijective. Since the q(x, y) approximate continuous maps f (x, y)
in sup norm, the second equality of (8.55) holds when p(x + iy, x −iy) = q(x, y)
is replaced by the continuous map f = f (x, y). If λ = x0 + iy0, it is not hard to see
χ{(x0,y0)} is the pointwise limit of a bounded sequence of continuous maps fn. Using
Theorem8.52(c) and dominated convergence (μu is ﬁnite), we have:
(u|P{(x0,y0)}u) =

u


supp(P)
χ{(x0,y0)}(x, y)d P(x, y) u

fn(x, y)d P(x, y) u

=
lim
n→+∞(u| fn(x0, y0)u) = χ{(x0,y0)}(x0, y0)(u|u) .
Since orthogonal projectors are idempotent and self-adjoint, and since χ{(x0,y0)}
(x0, y0) = 1 by deﬁnition,
(P{(x0,y0)}u|P{(x0,y0)}u) = (u|u) ̸= 0 .
Hence P{(x0,y0)} ̸= 0.
We conclude the proof of (i) by proving that P{λ} is the orthogonal projector onto
the λ-eigenspace Hλ of T , if λ ∈σp(T ). We proved above that
T P({λ}) = λP({λ})
for λ ∈σp(T ), so that P({λ})(H) ⊂Hλ. Let us show the opposite inclusion. Suppose
that u ∈Hλ, so that (T −λI)u = 0. We therefore have
0 = ||(T −λI)u||2 =

because the vectors in the right-hand side are pairwise orthogonal as the Dn are
pairwise disjoint. Since PDnu = 0, we conclude that u = P{λ}u, that is Hλ ⊂P{λ}(H)
as wanted.
Let us pass to (ii). As σc(T ) ∪σp(T ) = σ(T ) (by (i) Proposition 8.7(c)) and
σc(T ) ∩σp(T ) = ∅by deﬁnition, we must have λ ∈σc(T ) if and only if λ ∈σ(T )
and λ /∈σp(T ). But supp(P(T )) = σ(T ), so λ ∈σ(T ) is the same as saying, for
any open set A in R2 containing (x0, y0), x0 + iy0 = λ, that P(A) ̸= 0. On the other
hand, by (i), λ /∈σp(T ) means P(T )({(x0, y0)}) = 0.
Now (iii). If λ = x0 + iy0 ∈C is an isolated point in σ(T ), by deﬁnition there is
an open set A ∋{(x0, y0)} disjoint from the remaining part of σ(T ). If P({(x0, y0)})
were 0, then λ would belong to supp(P(T )), for in that case P(A) = 0. Necessarily,
then, P(T )({(x0, y0)}) ̸= 0. By (i) we have λ ∈σp(T ).
The proof of (iv) is contained in Theorem8.54(d), where we proved, among other
things, that if λ ∈σc(T ), for any natural number n > 0 there exists ψn ∈H with
||ψn|| ̸= 0 and 0 < ||T ψn −λψn||/||ψn|| ≤1/n. To have (iv) it sufﬁces to deﬁne
φn := ψn/||ψn|| with n such that 1 ≤εn for the given ε. □
8.4.2
Spectral Representation of Normal Operators in B(H)
The next important result provides a spectral representation for any normal operator
T ∈B(H): it is shown that every bounded normal operator can be viewed as a
multiplicative operator, on a suitable L2 space, basically built on the spectrum of T .
Theorem 8.58 (Spectral representation of normal operators in B(H))
Let H be a
Hilbert space, T ∈B(H) a normal operator, P(T ) the spectral measure of T over
the Borel sets of σ(T ), as of Theorem8.56(a).
(a) H splits as a Hilbert sum H = ⊕α∈AHα (A at most countable if H is separable),
where the subspaces Hα are closed and mutually orthogonal, such that:
(i) for any α ∈A, T Hα ⊂Hα and T ∗Hα ⊂Hα;
(ii) for any α ∈A there exist a positive, ﬁnite Borel measure μα on the spectrum
σ(T ) ⊂R2, and a surjective isometry Uα : Hα →L2(σ(T ), μα), such that

Proof (a) We prove (i), (ii) and (iii). The proof of (ii)’ is similar to (ii).
To begin with, assume there is a vector ψ ∈H whose subspace Hψ, containing
vectors of type

σ(T ) g(x, y) d P(T )(x, y)ψ, g ∈Mb(σ(T )), is dense in H. If μψ is
the spectral measure associated to ψ (ﬁnite since

1 dμψ = ||ψ||2 )
we have supp(μψ) ⊂supp(P(T )) by (iv) in Theorem8.52(c). Consider the Hilbert
space L2(σ(T), μψ) and the linear surjective operator
Vψ : Mb(σ(T )) ∋g →

σ(T )
g(x, y) d P(T )(x, y)ψ ∈Hψ .
As μψ is ﬁnite, Mb(σ(T )) ⊂L2(σ(T ), μψ) as subspace. Hence for any g1, g2 ∈
Mb(σ(T )),

The proof of (8.58) descends by the following observation. If E, E′ ⊂σ(T ) are

By Proposition 7.49, using the deﬁnition of integral of a measurable bounded map for
a spectral measure, by dominated convergence with respect to the ﬁnite measure μψ
and by the inner product’s continuity, the above identity implies (8.58). Thus we have
proved Vψ is a surjective isometry mapping Mb(σ(T )) to Hψ. Notice that Mb(σ(T ))
is dense in L2(σ(T), μψ), because if g ∈L2(σ(T ), μψ), the maps gn := χEn · g,
En := {(x, y) ∈σ(T ) | |g(x, y)| < n} ,
belong in Mb(σ(T )), and gn →g in L2(σ(T ), μψ) by dominated convergence
(pointwise |gn −g|2 →0, as n →+∞, and |gn −g|2 ≤2|g|2 ∈L1(σ(T ), μψ)).
So we can extend Vψ to a unique surjective isometry Vψ : L2(σ(T ), μψ) →Hψ,
whose inverse will be denoted by Uψ. Then Hψ = H.
If f ∈Mb(σ(T )), from (8.58) and using (iii) in Theorem8.54(a) we see that

The operator f · : L2(σ(T ), μψ) →L2(σ(T ), μψ), i.e. the multiplication by
f ∈Mb(σ(T )), is easily bounded. Since Mb(σ(T )) is dense in L2(σ(T ), μψ),
by deﬁnition of Uψ, because

σ(T )
f (x, y) d P(T )(x, y)
is bounded and, eventually, by continuity of the inner product, we have

Now we pass to the case in which there is no ψ with Hψ = H.
If so, let ψ be an arbitrary vector in H, and indicate by Hψ the space of vectors

σ(T) f (x, y)d P(T )(x, y)ψ, f ∈Mb(σ(T )). We have T (Hψ) ⊂Hψ and T ∗(Hψ) ⊂

analogous, using
T ∗=

σ(T )
(x −iy) d P(T ) .
By continuity T (Hψ) ⊂Hψ and T ∗(Hψ) ⊂Hψ. Deﬁning Uψ as before we have
(8.60).
Now let us show how to build another closed subspace Hψ′, orthogonal to Hψ,
invariant under T , T ∗and satisfying (8.60) for a corresponding surjective isometry
Uψ′ : Hψ′ →L2(σ(T ), μψ′). If 0 ̸= ψ′ ⊥Hψ then

ψ′


σ(T )

for any f ∈Mb(σ(T )). But then the properties of the integral with respect to spectral

where we used g· f ∈Mb(σ(T )). Overall, if ψ′ ⊥Hψ then Hψ′ is orthogonal to Hψ,
so the same holds for the closures by continuity of the inner product. The space Hψ′
is invariant under T and T ∗(the proof is the same as for Hψ), and (8.60) holds for the
surjective isometry Uψ′ : Hψ′ →L2(σ(T ), μψ′) (see the proof at the beginning).
Thus, choosing {ψα} suitably, we can construct closed subspaces Hα = Hψα, each
with a surjective isometry Uα : Hα →L2(σ(T ), μψ′), so that: (a) the spaces are
pairwise orthogonal; (b) each one is T -invariant and T ∗-invariant; (c) they satisfy

(8.61)
for any f ∈Mb(σ(T )). Call C the collection of these subspaces. We can order
C (partially) by inclusion. Then every ordered subset in C is upper bounded, and
Zorn’s lemma gives us a maximal element {Hα}α∈A in C. We claim H = ⊕α∈AHα.
It sufﬁces to show that if ψ belongs to the orthogonal complement of every Ha,
then ψ = 0. If there existed ψ ∈H with ψ ⊥Hα for any α ∈A and ψ ̸= 0, we
would be able to construct Hψ, distinct from every Hα but satisfying (a), (b), (c).
Consequently{Hα}α∈A∪{Hψ} wouldcontain{Hα}α∈A,producingacontradiction.We
conclude that if ψ is orthogonal to every Hα, it must vanish ψ = 0. Put equivalently,
< {Hα}α∈A > = H, so H = ⊕α∈AHα for the spaces are mutually orthogonal.
Now we prove (b) when T is normal (T self-adjoint or unitary is obtained spe-
cialising the same proof). We shall prove that λ /∈∪αsupp(μα) ⇔λ ∈ρ(T ),
which is equivalent to the claim. In turn, λ
/∈∪αsupp(μα) is equivalent to

460
8
Spectral Theory I: Generalities, Abstract C∗-Algebras and Operators in B(H)
λ ∈C \ ∪αsupp(μα), that is λ ∈Int(C \ ∪αsupp(μα)). The latter means
λ ∈Int(∩α(C \ supp(μα)).
(⇒) If λ ∈Int(∩α(C \ supp(μα)), take an open disc DR of radius R > 0 centred at
λ, with μα(DR) = 0 for any α ∈A; such a disc exists by the assumptions. On every
space L2(σ(T ), μα) the multiplication by (x, y) →(x + iy −λ)−1 is bounded,
with norm not exceeding 1/R (independent from α), and inverts (on the left and the
right) the multiplication by (x + iy −λ). Let Rλ(α) : Hα →Hα be the operator
U −1
α (x + iy −λ)−1 · Uα. It has the same norm of the operator (x + iy −λ)−1·, since
Ua is a surjective isometry, so ||Rλ(α)|| ≤1/R. Deﬁne Rλ : H →H so that
Rλ :

for any ψ ∈H. Remembering the Hα are invariant under T and Rλ (i.e. Rλ(α) on
each Hα), we easily see that ||Rλ|| ≤1/R and Rλ(T −λI) = (T −λI)Rλ = I. In
fact, RanRλ(α) = Hα implies

so Rλ(T −λI) = I. By Theorem8.4(a) λ ∈ρ(T ).
(⇐) Suppose now λ ∈ρ(T ), so (T −λI)−1 : H →H is the closed inverse to T −λI.
Pick ε > 0 so that ||(T −λI)−1|| =: 1/ε. We claim μα(Dε) = 0 for any α ∈A, Dε
being the open disc of radius ε centred at λ, so that λ ∈Int(∩α(C \ supp(μα)). We
proceed by contradiction. Suppose the last assertion is false, so there exists β ∈A
such that μβ(Dε) > 0. Consider an element ψ ∈H \ {0} deﬁned by Pαψ = 0 if
α ̸= βsps and Uβψ = f , such that f = 0 outside Dε and

Dε | f |2dμβ > 0. We can
always redeﬁne ψ so that ||ψ|| = 1. Then,

Therefore
||(T −λI)ψ|| < ε .
On the other hand, by deﬁnition of norm,
||(T −λI)−1|| ≥||(T −λI)−1φ||
||φ||
for any φ ∈H \ {0}. Setting (T −λI)−1φ = ψ, we have
1/ε = ||(T −λI)−1|| ≥
||ψ||
||(T −λI)ψ|| ,
so, as ||ψ|| = 1,
1/ε ≥
1
||(T −λI)ψ|| > 1/ε .
But that is a contradiction.
We ﬁnish the proof by showing (c). If H is separable, consider the collection of
orthogonal non-zero vectors {ψn}n∈N built as the {ψα}α∈A above, where now the index
α iscalledn ∈N(ifthereareﬁnitelymanyvectorsψα theargumentissimilar).Weare

on the nth factor σ(T ). It is clear that, in this way, μT (MT ) = +∞
n=0 ||ψn||2 < +∞.
The map FT clearly restricts to (x + iy)· on each component σ(T ). Hence FT is
bounded, because every copy of σ(T ) is bounded. The operator UT is built in the
obvious manner using the Un.
⊓⊔
One can rearrange canonically the decomposition of H into spaces isomorphic to L2.
In particular [DuSc88, vol.I] the following fact holds. In the statement we use the
symbol A△B := (A ∪B) \ (A ∩B) for the symmetric difference of two sets.
Theorem 8.59 Let T ∈B(H) be a normal operator on the separable Hilbert space
H.
(a) There exists a pair (μT , {ET n}n∈N), where μT is a positive, ﬁnite Borel measure on
C and {ET n}n∈N ⊂B(C) satisﬁes C = ET 1 ⊃ET 2 ⊃· · · , so that Theorem8.58(a)
holds (replacing σ(T ) by C everywhere) with A = N, μα(F) := μT (F ∩ETα) for
any α ∈N, F ∈B(C).
(b) If (μ′
T , {E′
T n}n∈N) satisﬁes part (a) then μT ≺μ′
T ≺μT and μT (ETn△E′
T n) =
μ′(ETn△E′
Tn) = 0 for any n ∈N.
(c) Let S ∈B(H) be a normal operator and suppose (μS, {ESn}n∈N) satisﬁes (a)
together with S. Then there exists a unitary operator U : H →H with U SU −1 = T
if and only if μT ≺μS ≺μT and μT (ET n△ESn) = μS(ET n△ESn) = 0 for any
n ∈N.

Evidently σ(T ) = supp(μT ). In case μT (ET n) ̸= 0 but μT (ETn+1) = 0, one says
T has spectral multiplicity n (including n = +∞if μT (ETn) ̸= 0 for any n). The
deﬁnition is clearly independent of the pair (μT , {ET n}n∈N) of (a). If μT (ET k) = 0
for some k then μ′
T (ETk) = 0, for μT ≺μ′
T ≺μT . Since μ′
T (ET k△E′
Tk) = 0
we have μ′
T (E′
Tk) = 0. By symmetry μ′
T (E′
T k) = 0 implies μT (ETk) = 0. The
unabridged theory of the spectral multiplicity can be found in [Hal51].
Examples 8.60
(1) Consider a compact self-adjoint operator T ∈B(H) on the Hilbert space H. By
Theorem4.19, σp(T ) is discrete in R, with possible unique limit point 0. Conse-
quently σ(T ) = σp(T ), except in case σp(T ) accumulates at 0, but 0 /∈σp(T ). In
that case (σ(T ) is closed by Theorem8.4) σ(T ) = σp(T ) ∪{0} and 0 is the only
point in σc(T ) (for σr(T ) = ∅by Proposition 8.7). Following Example8.51(3), we
can deﬁne a PVM on R that vanishes outside σ(T ):
PEx :=

λ∈E
Pλx
x ∈H
where E ⊂σ(T ), while Pλ is either the null projector Pλ = 0, or an orthogonal
projector onto the λ-eigenspace. The former case can occur only when λ = 0 is not
an eigenvalue. Mimicking Example8.51(3), we see

σ(T )
λP(λ)ψ =

λ∈σ(T )
λPλψ ,
for any ψ ∈H. On the other hand Theorem4.20 gives

λ∈σ(T )
λPλ = T ,
where P0 = 0 if 0 ∈σc(T ).
The statement of Theorem4.20 explains that the decomposition is valid in the
uniform topology provided we label eigenvalues properly. Using such an ordering,
for any ψ ∈H

λ∈σ(T )
λPλψ = T ψ .
We may interpret the sum as an integral in the PVM on σ(T ) deﬁned above. This also
proves that the series on the left can be rearranged (when projectors are applied to
some ψ ∈H). By construction, supp(P) = σ(T ). In conclusion: the above measure
on σ(T ) is the spectral measure of T , uniquely associated to T by the spectral
theorem. Moreover, the spectral decomposition of T is precisely the eigenspace
decomposition with respect to the strong topology:
T = s-

λ∈σp(T )
λPλ .

8.4 Spectral Theorem for Normal Operators in B(H)

The point 0 ∈σc(T ), if present, brings no contribution to the integral.
(2) Consider the operator T on H := L2([0, 1] × [0, 1], dx ⊗dy) deﬁned by
(T f )(x, y) = x f (x, y)
almost everywhere on X := [0, 1] × [0, 1], for any f ∈H. It is not hard to show T
is bounded, self-adjoint and its spectrum is σ(T ) = σc(T ) = [0, 1].
A spectral measure on R, with bounded support, that reproduces T as integral
operator is given by orthogonal projectors P(T )
E
that multiply by characteristic func-
tions χE′, E′ := (E ∩[0, 1]) × [0, 1], for any Borel set E ⊂R. Proceeding as in
Example8.51(1), and choosing appropriate domains, allows to see that

[0,1]
g(λ) d P(λ) f

(x, y) = g(x) f (x, y) ,
almost everywhere on X
for any g ∈Mb(X). In particular

[0,1]
λ d P(λ) f

(x, y) = x f (x, y) ,
almost everywhere on X ,
so
T =

[0,1]
λ d P(λ) ,
as required. This spectral measure is therefore the unique measure on R satisfying
condition (a) in the spectral representation theorem.
Let us concentrate on part (c) in the spectral representation theorem. A decompo-
sition of H of the kind prescribed in (c) can be obtained as follows. Let {un}n∈N be a
Hilbert basis of L2([0, 1], dy). Consider subspaces of H := L2([0, 1] × [0, 1], dx ⊗
dy) given, for any n ∈N, by
Hn := { f · un | f ∈L2([0, 1], dx)} .
It is easy to see that these subspaces, with respect to T , fulﬁl every request of item (c).
In particular, Hn is by construction isomorphic to L2([0, 1], dx) under the surjective
isometry f · un →f , so μn = dx.

In the ﬁnal section we state and prove a well-known result. Fuglede’s theorem estab-
lishes that an operator B ∈B(H) commutes with A∗, for A ∈B(H) normal,
provided it commutes with A. The result is far from obvious, and has immediate

consequences in the light of the previous section. Due to the spectral decompo-
sition Theorem8.56(c), for example, one corollary is that if B commutes with A
then it commutes with every operator

σ(T ) f (x, y)d P(A)(x, y), for any measurable
bounded map f : σ(T ) →C.
8.5.1
Fuglede’s Theorem
Theorem 8.61 (Fuglede) Let H be a Hilbert space. If A ∈B(H) is normal and
B ∈B(H) commutes with A, then B commutes with A∗as well.
Proof For s ∈C consider the function Z(s) = e−s A∗Bes A∗, where the exponentials
are deﬁned spectrally by integrals of C ∋x + iy →e∓s(x−iy) with respect to the
spectral measure P(A) of A. As usual z = x + iy and z = x −iy. Now observe
e∓s(x−iy) = +∞
n=0
(∓s(x−iy))n
n!
, and for given s, the convergence is uniform in (x, y)
on every compact set, like σ(A). In particular this means the sequence of partial
sums is bounded in norm || ||∞. Using again the PVM associated spectrally to A, by
Theorem8.54(c) we have
e∓s A∗= s-
+∞

n=0
(∓s A∗)n

.
(8.62)
Expanding Z(s)Aψ and AZ(s)ψ as above, and recalling A∗and B commute with
A, we see An Z(s)ψ = Z(s)Anψ for any ψ ∈H. Hence the exponential expansion
gives
e∓s AZ(s)ψ = Z(s)e∓s Aψ
for any ψ ∈H.
Therefore
Z(s) = Z(s)e+s Ae−s A = e+s AZ(s)e−s A = e−s A∗e+s A Bes A∗e−s A = e−s A∗+s ABes A∗−s A .
To obtain this we need the identities e−s A∗e+s A = e−s A∗+s A and e+s Ae−s A = I, which

The map C ∋s →(ψ|Z(s)φ) is then bounded on the entire complex plane. If this
function were entire (i.e. analytic on C), Liouville’s theorem would force it to be
constant. So let us assume the map is entire, hence constant. Consequently, since
ψ, φ are arbitrary, Z(s) = Z(0) for any s ∈C. This identity reads e−s A∗Bes A∗= B,
i.e. Bes A∗= es A∗B. Therefore (ψ|Bes A∗φ) = (ψ|es A∗Bφ) for any ψ, φ ∈H. This
equation can be written (B∗ψ|es A∗φ) = (ψ|es A∗Bφ), and by the properties of PVMs
and the spectral theorem:

derivative and integral (the derivatives of the integrands are continuous in (s, (x, y)),
hence bounded on the compact set C×K, whereC is some compact subset containing
s = 0; hence Theorem1.88 applies). The outcome is

which we can write (ψ|B A∗φ) = (ψ|A∗Bφ). Varying ψ and φ, we obtain that B

⊓⊔
The theorem generalises, if we drop the boundedness of A (but keeping that of B).
This was Fuglede’s original statement [Fug50], whose proof requires the spectral
theory of unbounded normal operators that we will not develop.
8.5.2
Consequences to Fuglede’s Theorem
Corollary 8.62 Let H be a Hilbert space. If M, N ∈B(H) are normal and satisfy
N M = M N, then N M is normal.
Proof First, M N(M N)∗= M N M∗N ∗. By Fuglede’s theorem the right-hand side
is M M∗N N ∗= M∗M N ∗N = M∗N ∗M N = (N M)∗M N. But N, M commute, so
(N M)∗M N = (M N)∗M N. Hence we have proved M N(M N)∗= (M N)∗M N, i.e.
the claim.
⊓⊔
Corollary 8.63 (Fuglede–Putnam–Rosenblum) Let H be a Hilbert space and
T, M, N ∈B(H). If M, N are normal and MT = T N then M∗T = T N ∗.
Proof Consider the Hilbert space H ⊕H with standard inner product ((u, v)|
(u′, v′)) := (u|u′)(v|v′), and the operators of B(H ⊕H):
T ′ : (u, v) →(0, T u) ,
N ′ : (u, v) →(Nu, Mv) .
By direct computation N ′N ′∗= N ′∗N ′, i.e. N ′ is normal, and N ′T ′ = T ′N ′ by the
fact that MT = T N. We can apply Fuglede’s theorem to get N ′∗T ′ = T ′N ′∗. Since
N ′∗: (u, v) →(N ∗u, M∗v), taking the components of the identity N ′∗T ′(u, v) =
T ′N ′∗(u, v) gives M∗T u = T N ∗u for any u ∈H, i.e. M∗T = T N ∗.
⊓⊔
Corollary 8.64 Let M, N ∈B(H) be normal operators on the Hilbert space H. If
there is a bijection S ∈B(H) such that
MS = SN ,

8.5 Fuglede’s Theorem and Consequences
467
then there is also a unitary operator U ∈B(H) such that
U MU −1 = N .
Proof Observe preliminarily S−1 ∈B(H) by Theorem2.96. By polar decomposition
S = U|S|, with U unitary, and therefore MU|S| = U|S|N. In our case |S|−1 exists
and equals |S−1|, as is easy to see. The proof ﬁnishes if we can show that |S|N =
N|S|, for then we can left-apply |S|−1 on MU|S| = U N|S|. Let us prove that. By
by Fuglede–Putnam–Rosenblum theorem MS = SN implies M∗S = SN ∗. Taking
adjoints, S∗M = N S∗. Using MS = SN again, we get S∗MS = S∗SN = N S∗S,
i.e. |S|2N = N|S|2. By Theorem3.77(a), |S|N = N|S|.

8.4 Prove that the residual spectrum of a unitary operator is empty, without using
the fact that ‘unitary ⇒normal’.
Solution. If λ ∈σr(U), Ran(U −λI) is not dense, so there exists f ̸= 0
orthogonal to Ran(U −λI). For any g ∈H, ( f |λg) = ( f |Ug), so (λ f |g) =
(U ∗f |g) for any g ∈H. Hence U ∗f = λ f . Letting U act on this relation gives
f = λU f , and then U f = λf , because 1/λ = λ by |λ| = 1. Consequently
λ ∈σp(U). But this is absurd, for the point and residual spectra are disjoint, and
hence σr(U) = ∅.

Solution. 0 ∈σr(U) and U −0I is one-to-one, but Ran(U −0I) = RanU is
not dense. Let us prove that by contradiction. If it were dense, for any f ∈H there
would exist { fn}n∈N ⊂H with U fn →f . Since || fn −fm|| = U fn −U fm, then
{ fn} would be a Cauchy sequence, and fn →g ∈H. Hence Ug = f for any f ∈H,

Hint. Consider the operator of Exercise8.6 and the operator that multiplies by the
coordinate x in L2([0, 1], dx), where dx is the Lebesgue measure on R.

(Af )(x) =
 x
0
f (t)dt .
Studyitsspectrumandproveσ(A) = σc(A) = {0}.Conclude,withoutcomputations,
that A cannot be normal.
Solution. Since [0, 1] has ﬁnite Lebesgue measure, then L2([0, 1], dx) ⊂
L1([0, 1], dx), and we can view Lebesgue’s integral as a function of the upper limit
of integration (in particular, Theorem1.76 holds). Notice the spectrum of A cannot
be empty by Theorem8.4, since A is bounded and hence closed. If λ ̸= 0, then
(λ−1A)n is a contraction operator for n large enough, as we saw in Exercise4.19. By
the ﬁxed-point theorem λ ̸= 0 cannot be an eigenvalue, since the unique solution ψ
to the characteristic equation λ−1Aψ = ψ is ψ = 0, which is not an eigenvector.
As A is compact, Lemma 4.52 guarantees that if 0 ̸= λ (hence λ /∈σp(A)), then
Ran(A −λI) = H (i.e. the Hilbert space L2([0, 1], dx)). Moreover, since A −λI
is bijective, (A −λI)−1 : H →H is bounded by the inverse-operator theorem.
Therefore λ /∈σ(A) if λ ̸= 0. So the unique point in the spectrum is λ = 0.
By Theorem1.76(b) there are no non-zero solutions to Aψ = 0, and we conclude
0 ∈σr(A)∪σc(A). If 0 were in σr(A), Ran(A) would not be dense in L2([0, 1], dx),
i.e. Ker(A∗) ̸= {0} because H = Ran(A) ⊕Ker(A∗). This is not possible, because
(A∗f )(x) =
 1
x f (t)dt (see Exercise3.29), so applying Theorem1.76(b) would give
a contradiction.
If A were normal, its boundedness would imply ||A|| = r(A). But r(A) = 0, for
σ(A) = {0}. Therefore A would be forced to be null.

Outline of solution. If σ(T ) is ﬁnite the claim is obvious by the spectral theorem
and because operators with ﬁnite-dimensional range are compact. Consider the other
case. Expand T spectrally: T = 
j λ j(ψ j| )ψ j, where ||T || ≥λ j ≥λ j+1 →0+
by compactness, and for any given j, λ j+k = λ j only for a ﬁnite number of k (if
the eigenvalue is non-null). Recall that for compact operators the expansion con-
verges in the uniform topology, too. If α ≥1 and m, n are large enough, then

j=n λ j(ψ j|)ψ j||. Bearing in mind the spectral decompo-
sition theorem for the self-adjoint operator T α, conclude that T α, α > 1, is compact
as uniform limit of compact operators (ranges are ﬁnite-dimensional). When α < 1,
observe ||T 1/2x −T 1/2y||2 = ((x −y)|T (x −y)) ≤||x −y||||T x −T y||, then
conclude that T 1/2 is compact if T is compact, by using the deﬁnition of compact
operator. When α ∈[1/2, 1), T α = (T 1/2)β for some β ∈[1, 2). Relying on the
previous proof recover that T α is compact if T is when α ∈[1/2, 1). Iterating the

procedure obtain that T 1/4 and T α, α ∈[1/4, 1/2), are compact if T is, and so on;
hence reach any T α, with α ∈(0, 1), because in that case α ∈[1/2k+1, 1/2k) for
some k = 0, 1, 2, . . ..

ﬁnd x ∈H such that

σ(T ) λdμx(λ) < 0.
8.20 If H is a Hilbert space, prove T ∈B(H) is of trace class (T ∈B1(H)) ⇔

u∈N |(u|T u)| < +∞for every Hilbert basis N ⊂H.
Solution. Suppose 
u∈N |(u|T u)| < +∞for every Hilbert basis N. Assume,
ﬁrst, T

=

R λd P(T )(λ). Deﬁne T−:=

(−∞,0) λd P(T )(λ) and T+ :=

[0,+∞) λd P(T )(λ). Clearly T± ∈B(H) (|λχ(−∞,0)| ≤
|λ|, |λχ[0,+∞)| ≤|λ| and λ is bounded on the support of P(T ) by the spectral theorem
for self-adjoint bounded operators). Moreover ±T± ≥0 by exercise 8.19. Further-
more, H = H−⊕H+ is a closed orthogonal sum where H−:= P(T )((−∞, 0))H,
H+ := P(T )([0, +∞))H. Let N−⊂H−, N+ ⊂H+ be Hilbert bases, so N :=
N−∪N+ is a Hilbert basis of H. As −T−, T+ ≥0 and T±u = 0 if u ∈H∓, we have

Therefore T± ∈B1(H) by Deﬁnition 4.32, so T = T+ + T−∈B1(H) by Theo-

A := 1

Chapter 9
Spectral Theory II: Unbounded Operators
on Hilbert Spaces
The language of mathematics turns out to be unreasonably
effective in natural sciences, a wonderful gift that we don’t
understand nor deserve.
Eugene Paul Wigner
In this second chapter on spectral theory we shall examine a number of mathematical
issues concerning typically unbounded self-adjoint operators.
The ﬁrst section is devoted to extending the spectral decomposition theorem of
the previous chapter to unbounded self-adjoint operators. The proof relies on a gener-
alisation of the integration procedure for spectral measures to unbounded functions,
and on the Cayley transform. The resulting technique will also enable us to prove,
in passing, an important characterisation of the von Neumann algebra generated by
a bounded normal operator and its adjoint. Then we will describe two physically-
relevant examples of unbounded self-adjoint operators and their spectral decompo-
sition: the Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator, and the position and momentum
operators. Finally we will state a spectral representation theorem for unbounded
self-adjoint operators and introduce joint spectral measures.
The second, very short, section is dedicated to exponentiating unbounded opera-
tors, in relationship to earlier-deﬁned analytic vectors.
In section three we will focus on the theory of strongly continuous one-parameter
groups of unitary operators. First we will establish that the various notions of conti-
nuity are equivalent. Next we will show von Neumann’s theorem on the continuity
of measurable one-parameter groups of unitary operators, and then go on to prove
Stone’s theorem and a few important corollaries. In particular, we will discuss a useful
criterion, based on one-parameter unitary groups generated by self-adjoint operators,
to establish when the spectral measures of two self-adjoint operators commute. We
recommend [Schm12] for a recent and quite complete treatise on the whole subject.

Spectral Theory II: Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
9.1
Spectral Theorem for Unbounded Self-adjoint
Operators
We now set out to generalise some of the material of Chap.8. In particular we want
to prove the spectral decomposition theorem in the case of unbounded self-adjoint
operators. The physical relevance lies in that most self-adjoint operators representing
interesting observables in Quantum Mechanics are unbounded. The paradigmatic
case is the position operator of Chap.5.
9.1.1
Integrating Unbounded Functions with Respect
to Spectral Measures
We will often use the following natural deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 9.1 Let X be a complex vector space, T an operator on X with domain
D(T ) and p(x) = m
k=0 akxk a polynomial of degree m with complex coefﬁcients.
(a) The operator p(T ) on X is deﬁned by writing T in place of the variable x, with
T 0 := I, T 1 := T , T 2 := T T , and so on.
(b) The domain of p(T ) is
D(p(T )) :=
m

k=0
D(akT k) ,
(9.1)
with D(akT · · · T ) given in Deﬁnition5.1.
Extending the previous chapter’s results to unbounded operators requires ﬁrst a def-
inition for the integral of unbounded functions with respect to a PVM. If P is a
spectral measure on the measurable space (X, Σ(X)), in the sense of Deﬁnition8.41,
and if f : X →C is a measurable function (for the σ-algebra Σ(X)), but not neces-
sarily bounded, based on what we know

X f (x)d P(x) is meaningless. The point is
to make sense of this integral.
Consider a vector ψ, in a Hilbert space H, of the projector-valued measure P such
that

X
| f (x)|2 dμψ(x) < +∞,
(9.2)
where the spectral measure μψ for ψ was deﬁned in Theorem8.52(c). We can ﬁnd
a sequence of bounded measurable maps fn such that, for every ﬁxed ψ ∈H, we
have fn →f as n →+∞in L2(X, μψ). For example, using Lebesgue’s dominated
convergence it sufﬁces to consider fn := χFn · f , where {Fn}n∈N is any family of
Borel subsets of X such that

∪m∈N Fm = X ,
Fn+1 ⊃Fn ,

∀x ∈Fn, for some Cn ∈R, ∀n ∈N.
(9.3)
A simple choice is
Fn := {x ∈X | | f (x)| < n} .
(9.4)
Using (ii) in (a) and (b) of Theorem8.54 we immediately ﬁnd

Therefore
the

vectors

to
some

X f (x)d P(x)ψ:

X
f (x)d P(x)ψ :=
lim
n→+∞

X
fn(x)d P(x)ψ .
(9.6)
We may use (9.6) as deﬁnition of the integral in P of the unbounded measurable func-
tion f . This is well deﬁned since

X f (x)d P(x)ψ does not depend on the sequence
{ fn}n∈N. In fact if {gn}n∈N is another sequence of bounded measurable maps con-
verging to f in L2(X, μψ), proceeding as before we obtain



X
fn(x)d P(x)ψ −

X
gn(x)d P(x)ψ



X

so
lim
n→+∞

X
fn(x)d P(x)ψ =
lim
n→+∞

X
gn(x)d P(x)ψ .
If we use (9.6) to deﬁne the integral of an unbounded function we must remember that
this operator is not deﬁned on the whole Hilbert space, but only on vectors satisfying
(9.2). Consequently we have to check that these vectors form a subspace in H. To
show this, and much more, we need to a lemma that relates the spectral measure μψ
to μφ,ψ via (9.2), for ψ ∈H.

The next theorem gathers several technical facts seen above, and establishes the ﬁrst
general properties of integrals of unbounded maps with respect to a spectral measure.
Theorem 9.3 Let (X, Σ(X)) be a measurable space, H a Hilbert space and P :
Σ(X) →B(H) a PVM.
For any measurable f : X →C deﬁne
Δ f :=

9.1 Spectral Theorem for Unbounded Self-adjoint Operators
477
(withright-hand-sidetermasin(9.6),andusinganysequenceofboundedmeasurable
maps { fn}n∈N converging to f in L2(X, μψ)):
(i) is a linear operator;
(ii) extends the integral operator of measurable bounded functions f ∈Mb(X)
of Deﬁnition8.49(b).
(c) Assume that X is a topological space, Σ(X) = B(X) and at least one of the
hypotheses (1) and (2) in Proposition8.44(d) is valid, so that P is concentrated on
supp(P). If f ↾supp(P) is bounded, then:
Δ f = H and

X
f (x)d P(x) =

supp(P)
f (x)d P(x) ∈B(H) ,
where the right side is the operator of Deﬁnition8.49(c).
Proof (a)–(b). As ﬁrst thing we have to prove, for any given measurable f : X →C,
that φ + ψ ∈Δ f and cφ ∈Δ f for any c ∈C if φ, ψ ∈Δ f . Note Δ f contains the
null vector of H, so it is non-empty.
If φ, ψ ∈Δ f , E ∈Σ(X):
||PE(φ + ψ)||2 ≤(||PEφ|| + ||PEψ||)2 ≤2||PEφ||2 + 2||PEψ||2 ;
since μχ(E) = (χ|PEχ) = (χ|PE PEχ) = (PEχ|PEχ) = ||PEχ||2:
μφ+ψ(E) ≤2(μφ(E) + μψ(E)) .
This implies, for L2(X, μφ) ∋f and L2(X, μψ) ∋f , that L2(X, μφ+ψ) ∋f . That
is to say, φ, ψ ∈Δ f ⇒φ + ψ ∈Δ f . On the other hand μcφ(E) = |c|2(PEφ|φ) =
|c|2μφ(E), so f ∈L2(X, μcφ) for f ∈L2(X, μφ) and c ∈C. That is to say,
φ ∈Δ f ⇒cφ ∈Δ f , so Δ f is a subspace. That

X f (x)d P(x) : Δ f ∋ψ 
→

X f (x)d P(x)ψ is linear is a consequence of the deﬁnition of

X f (x)d P(x)ψ and
of the linearity of the integral of a bounded map in a PVM.
Now we show Δ f is dense in H. Given f as in the statement, let:
En := {x ∈X | n −1 ≤| f (x)| < n} ,
for any n ∈N, n ≥1.
Note En ∩Em = ∅if n ̸= m and ∪n En = X. By Deﬁnition8.41 the closed subspaces
Hn := P(En)H are mutually orthogonal, and by propriety (d) of the same deﬁnition
ﬁnite combinations over the Hn form a dense space inside H. We claim Δ f contains
this subspace. By monotone convergence, if ψ ∈H:

X
| f (x)|2dμψ(x) = lim
k→+∞
k

n=1

X
|χEn(x) f (x)|2dμψ(x) ≤+∞.
(9.10)
The integral inside the sum can be written as follows, using Theorem8.54(b):


X
χEn(x) f (x)d P(x)ψ


X
χEn(x) f (x)d P(x)ψ
	
.
But since x 
→χEn(x) f (x) is bounded and χEn = χEn · χEn, using (iii) in Theo-
rem8.54(a) gives

X
χEn(x) f (x)d P(x)ψ =

X
χEn(x) f (x)d P(x)

X
χEn(x)d P(x)ψ
=

X
χEn(x) f (x)d P(x) ◦P(En)ψ .
If ψ ∈Hn, then, as projectors P(Em) are orthogonal,

X
χEk(x) f (x)d P(x)ψ = 0,
for k ̸= n .
Under the assumptions on ψ, therefore, the series of (9.10) becomes

X
| f (x)|2dμψ(x) =

X
|χEn(x) f (x)|2dμψ(x) ≤

X
n2dμψ(x) = n2||ψ||2 < +∞.
We conclude Hn ⊂Δ f , for any n = 1, 2, . . .. But Δ f is a subspace so it contains
also the dense space of ﬁnite combinations of the Hn. Hence Δ f itself is dense.
The new deﬁnition of integral extends the old one for functions in Mb(X) of
Deﬁnition8.49(b). For if the sequence Mb(X) ∋fn →f ∈Mb(X) in (9.6) is
chosen as fn = χFn · f with Fn deﬁned in (9.4), then this sequence is bounded
and converges pointwise to f . Hence, Theorem8.54(c) implies that the limit (9.6)
deﬁning the new notion of integral coincides with that of Deﬁnition8.49(b).
(c) Given f : X →C, let Fn be deﬁned as in (9.4). Suppose f ↾supp(P) is bounded.
Deﬁne bounded measurable maps fn := χsupp(P)· f +gn where gn = χFn ·χX\supp(P)·
f . Since supp(μψ) ⊂supp(P) by Theorem8.52(v), for any ψ ∈H we have
f ∈L2(X, μψ), hence Δ f = H because μ f is ﬁnite, and:

X
| fn(x) −f (x)|2dμψ(x) =

supp(P)
| f (x) −f (x)|2dμψ(x) = 0 .
Consequently fn →f in L2(X, μψ) for any ψ ∈H, so:

X
f (x)d P(x)ψ :=
lim
n→+∞

X
fn(x)d P(x)ψ =

Now a result that deals, in particular, with composites of integrals of spectral mea-

(h) If (X′, Σ′(X′)) is a measurable space and φ : X →X′ is measurable (i.e.
φ−1(E′) ∈Σ(X) for E′ ∈Σ′(X′)), then
Σ′(X′) ∋E′

We claim T :=

X f (x)d P(x), deﬁned on Δ f , is closed. Notice, ﬁrst, that the
bounded operators
Tk :=

X
χFk(x) f (x)d P(x) ,
(9.27)
for ψ ∈Δ f , are such that: (1) T PFkψ = PFk T ψ = Tkψ and (2) Tkψ →T ψ,
k →+∞. The proof of (1) is similar to Theorem9.3(c), whilst (2) follows from the
argument preceding Lemma9.2. So let {ψn}n∈N ⊂Δ f be such that ψn →ψ ∈H
and T ψn →φ, n →+∞. We claim ψ ∈Δ f and T ψ = φ, implying the closure of
T . By (1) and because PFk →I strongly as k →+∞for (9.25):
Tkψ =

in H as k →+∞.
Deﬁne φk := Tkψ; then

X
χFk(x) f (x)d P(x)ψ = φk →φ
in H as k →+∞.
(9.28)
By Theorem8.54(b):

X
χFk(x)| f (x)|2dμψ(x) = ||φk||2 →||φ||2 < +∞as n →+∞.
Monotone convergence ensures f ∈L2(X, μψ), i.e. ψ ∈Δ f . Rewriting (9.28) as
Tkψ = φk, and taking the limit as k →+∞using (2), gives T ψ = φ, as required.
(b) Δ f = Δ f is an obvious consequence of the deﬁnition of Δ f and | f | = | f |. We

T :=

X f (x)d P(x) and take the bounded operators Tk of (9.27). Fix ψ ∈D(T ∗).
Then there exists h ∈H such that, for any φ ∈Δ f , (ψ|T φ) = (h|φ). Choosing
φ = T ∗
k ψ we obtain (ψ|TkT ∗
k ψ) = (h|T ∗
k ψ), where we used T T ∗
k = TkT ∗
k because
T ∗
k = PFk T ∗
k from T PFk = Tk. Therefore ||T ∗
k ψ||2 = (h|T ∗
k ψ), so ||T ∗
k ψ||2 ≤
||T ∗
k ψ|| ||h||, i.e. ||T ∗
k ψ|| ≤||h||. Consequently, by Theorem8.54(b):

X
χFk(x)| f (x)|2dμψ(x) ≤||h||2
for any k ∈N,
which implies ψ ∈Δ f by monotone convergence. So we have D(T ∗) ⊂Δ f .
(c) Formulas (9.12), (9.13) and the ensuing remark are trivial consequences of the
given deﬁnitions and of standard domains. Let us prove (9.14), (9.15). Assume f
is bounded so that Δ f ·g ⊂Δg, and ψ ∈Δg. Take a sequence {gn}n∈N of bounded
measurable maps converging to g in L2(X, dμg). Then f ·gn →f ·g in L2(X, dμg),
and because the integrals of f , gn, f · gn are as in Deﬁnition8.49, plus (iii) in
Theorem8.54(a), we immediately have, for n →+∞:

X
f (x)d P(x)

X
gn(x)d P(x)ψ =

X
( f ·gn)(x)d P(x)ψ →

X
( f ·g)(x)d P(x)ψ.
As

X f d P is continuous, we will prove that f bounded and ψ ∈Δg imply

X
f (x)d P(x)

X
g(x)d P(x)ψ =

X
( f · g)(x)d P(x)ψ .
(9.29)
Let now φ :=

X gd Pψ. By (f) the identity shows

X
| f (x)|2dμφ(x) =

X
|( f ·g)(x)|2dμψ(x) if f is bounded and ψ ∈Δg. (9.30)
Take now f just measurable, possibly unbounded. As (9.30) holds for bounded maps,
it holds for unbounded ones too. Since
D

X
f (x)d P(x)

X
g(x)d P(x)
	
contains all ψ ∈Δg such that φ ∈Δ f , which happens by (9.30) precisely when
ψ ∈Δ f ·g, we conclude:
D

X
f (x)d P(x)

X
gd P(x)
	
= Δg ∩Δ f ·g .
Suppose φ ∈Δg ∩Δ f ·g. When ψ =

X g(x)d P(x)φ and fn := χFn · f (Fn as
previously), then fn →f in L2(X, μψ), fn · g →f · g in L2(X, μφ) and (9.29) and
part (f) ( fn replacing f ) imply:

This ends the proof of (9.14) and (9.15).
Inclusion (9.14) plus the equality in case Δg ⊃Δ f ·g easily imply (9.18) and
(9.19). Concerning (9.18), we have Δ f ⊃Δ f · f = Δ| f |2 for the following reason: as
μψ is ﬁnite, if ψ ∈Δ| f (x)|2

X
| f (x)|2dμψ(x) =

X
| f (x)|2·1dμψ(x) ≤

X
| f (x)|4dμψ(x)

X
12dμψ(x) < +∞.
(d) By (9.14) and (9.12) we have
p(T ) ⊂

X
p(x) d P(x) .
Hence the claim is true when D(p(T )) = Δp. To prove this we shall start from
showing by induction
D(T n) = Δxn
for n ∈N.
(9.31)
When n = 0, 1, the identity is true: D(T 0) = Δ1 = H, D(T ) = Δx. Assume it
true for a given n and let us prove it for n + 1: D(T n+1) = Δxn+1. We have to show
D(T T n) = Δx◦xn. Using the special property stated after (9.15), we know the claim
is equivalent to Δx◦xn ⊂Δxn. The latter holds because μψ is positive and ﬁnite, and
|xn+1| > |xn| outside a compact set J ⊂R, so ψ ∈Δxn+1 implies

R
|x|2ndμψ(x) =

R\J


R
1dμψ(x) < +∞.
We remark, for later, that we have also obtained
D(T n+1) = Δxn+1 ⊂Δxn = D(T n) .
To ﬁnish the proof of D(p(T )) = Δp we compute separately the two sides. Take the
leading coefﬁcient am ̸= 0 in p. As D(T n+1) ⊂D(T n), and in general D(A + B) =
D(A) ∩D(B), we have

484

Spectral Theory II: Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
D(p(T )) = D(T m) .
(9.32)
Let us compute Δp. Since Δxn+1 ⊂Δxn, we ﬁnd Δxm ⊂Δp. Let us prove the opposite
inclusion. From |p(x)|/|x|m →|am|, |x| →+∞, follows |p(x)|/|x|m ≤|am|+ε >
0 for any ε > 0, provided x does not belong in too large a compact set Jε ⊂R.
Hence if ψ ∈Δp:

and so ψ ∈Δxm. Therefore Δp ⊂Δxm and Δp = Δxm. From (9.31) and (9.32) we
have Δp = Δxm = D(T m) = D(p(T )), ending this part.

X f (x)d P(x).
(f) This statement follows, by continuity, from the similar property of bounded maps,
seen in Theorem8.54(b), when we use our deﬁnition of integral of unbounded maps.
(g) Likewise, Theorem8.52(b) implies (g). In fact if f ≥0, ψ ∈Δ f , the sequence
of maps χFn · fn ≥0 (Fn as in (9.3)) tends to f in L2(X, μψ), so

(h) We shall outline the proof as it is elementary, if tedious. By direct inspection
P′ is a PVM. If f is simple, assertion (9.24) is trivial. Using Deﬁnition8.49 one
generalises (9.24) to bounded measurable maps, so (9.24) extends by virtue of the
deﬁnition of integral for unbounded f .
□
Corollary 9.5 Under the assumptions of Theorem9.3, if f : X →C is measurable
the following facts are equivalent.
(a) Δ f = H.
(b) f is essentially bounded with respect to the projector-valued measure P (Deﬁn-
ition8.45).
(c)

X f (x)d P(x) is bounded.

Then we can redeﬁne f on a zero-measure set for P obtaining || f ||∞< +∞, and
without altering

X f d P: that latter can be computed with Deﬁnition8.49 and yields
the same result.
Proof Let us prove (a) ⇔(b) ⇔(c) ⇒(9.33). Regarding (d), we will show (a) + (c)
⇒(d), while (d) ⇒(c) is trivial.

X f d P isclosedbyTheorem9.4(a).
On the other hand, (c) ⇒(a) because

X f d P is closed with dense domain by
Theorem9.3(a). Indeed, if x ∈H, there is a sequence D(

X f d Pxn converges to some point in H because the operator is bounded assuming
(c). Next, closure implies that x ∈D(

(b) ⇒(c). Deﬁne Fn as in (9.4). If fn := χFn · f , then fn →f pointwise as n →+∞.

***** Inclusions (9.12) and (9.14) can be turned into equalities by taking the clo-
sures of the left-hand sides, as shown in the next proposition. We need a preliminary
technical lemma, whose proof was essentially contained in Theorem9.4(a), but is
interesting in its own right.
Lemma 9.6 Under the assumptions of Theorem9.3, take a measurable f : X →C
and a family {Fn}n∈N ⊂Σ(X) as in (9.3).
The subspace < PFn(H) >n∈N containing ﬁnite linear combinations of the PFn(H)
satisﬁes:
(a) < PFn(H) >n∈N⊂Δ f , and it is dense in H,
(b)

X f d P(< P(Fn)(H) >n∈N) ⊂< P(Fn)(H) >n∈N,
(c) < PFn(H) >n∈N is a core for

X f d P.
Proof (a) Deﬁne E0 = F0 and En := Fn \ Fn−1 as in the proof of Theorem9.4(a),
so that: (i) Ek ∩Eh = ∅for h ̸= k, (ii) Fn = ∪n
j=0E j, (iii) ∪∞
j=0En = X, and (9.26)
holds true. Next (i), (ii) and the basic properties of a PVM imply
D0 :=< P(Fn)(H) >n∈N=< P(En)(H) >n∈N
and (9.26) entails that D0 is dense in H. Furthermore D0 ⊂Δ f . Indeed, we know
that ψ ∈D0 ⇔ψ = m
j=0 P(E j)ψ for some ﬁnite m. Hence (i) and elementary
properties of a PVM imply

j=0

E j
| f (x)|2dμψ(x) < +∞,
since f is bounded on each E j ⊂Fj by deﬁnition of Fj.

which means that

X f d P(D0) ⊂D0.
(c) We start by observing that

X f d P is closed by Theorem9.4(a), so

X f d P ↾D0
is closable and

X f d P ↾D0 ⊂

X f d P. To obtain the converse inclusion, ﬁx a point
(ψ,

X f d Pψ) in the graph of

X f d P and consider the sequence of points of the
graph of

X f (x)d P(x) ↾D0:

P(Fn)ψ,

X
f d P ↾D0 P(Fn)ψ
	
n ∈N ,
where the second entry is well deﬁned as P(Fn)ψ ∈D0. We have:

P(Fn)ψ,

X
f d P ↾D0 P(Fn)ψ

P(Fn)ψ,

X
f d P P(Fn)ψ
	
=

P(Fn)ψ,

X
fnd Pψ
	
where fn := χFn · f , and we have exploited (9.19) with E = Fn. Just in view of
(9.25) and the very deﬁnition (9.9) of

X f (x)d P(x) we have that, as n →+∞, in
the topology of the graph

P(Fn)ψ,

X
fnd Pψ
	
→

ψ,

X
f d Pψ
	
.
This result can be rephrased as

X f d P(x) ↾D0 ⊃

X f d P, concluding the proof.

Proof Deﬁne Borel sets Fn := {x ∈X | | f (x)| + |g(x)| + | f (x)g(x)| < n}, when
n ∈N. This family satisﬁes (9.3) for f , g, f + g and f · g simultaneously, so in
particular < P(Fk) >k∈N is contained in Δ f , Δg, Δ f +g, Δ f ·g by Lemma9.6(a), and
it is a core for the corresponding integral operators by Lemma9.6(c).
Let us ﬁrst focus on (9.34). From (9.12) we have

↾<P(Fk)>k∈N⊂

↾<P(Fk)>k∈N ⊂

↾<P(Fk)>k∈N =

X
f + g d P .

To prove (9.36), deﬁne the pairwise disjoint sets Ek associated to the Fk as in the
proof of Lemma9.6, so that ψ ∈< P(Fk) >k∈N ⇔ψ = n

Since < P(Fk) >k∈N is a core of

X f + g d P (Lemma9.6(c)), taking closures we
obtain (9.36), proving (9.34).
Let us pass to (9.35). As in the previous case, from (9.14) we have

X
f d P

X
gd P
	
↾<P(Fk)>k∈N ⊂

X
f d P

X
gd P ⊂

X
f · g d P ,
where the ﬁrst integral is well deﬁned because of Lemma9.6(b). The proofs ends as
soon as one proves that

X
f d P

X
gd P
	
↾<P(Fk)>k∈N =

X
f · g d P .
(9.37)

sees that

X

↾<P(Fk)>k∈N=

X
f · g d P ↾<P(Fk)>k∈N .
Since < P(Fk) >k∈N is a core for

X f · g d P, taking closures yields (9.37), con-
cluding the proof.
□
The next deﬁnition is based on (9.9). We can also make use of Theorem9.4(e) to
obtain a more elegant, equivalent deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 9.8 Let (X, Σ(X)) be a measurable space, H a Hilbert space and P :
Σ(X) →B(H) a PVM.
(a) If f : X →C is measurable with Δ f as in (9.8), the operator

X
f (x)d P(x) : Δ f →H
of (9.9) is called integral of f with respect to the projector-valued measure P.
Equivalently,

X f (x)d P(x) is the unique operator S : Δ f →H such that
(φ |Sψ ) =

X
f (x)dμφ,ψ(x) ,
for any φ ∈H, ψ ∈Δ f ,
where the complex spectral measure μφ,ψ is deﬁned in Theorem8.52(c).
(b) For every E ∈Σ(X), f : X →C and g : E →C measurable, the integrals


E
f (x) d P(x) :=

X
χE(x) f (x) d P(x) and

E
g(x) d P(x) :=

X
g0(x) d P(x) ,
with g0(x) := g(x) if x ∈E and g0(x) := 0 if x /∈E, are respectively called
integral of f on E and integral of g on E (in the projector-valued measure P).
Remarks 9.9
(1) By Theorem9.3(c), the above extends Deﬁnition8.49 for bounded maps.
(2) Assume that X is a topological space, Σ(X) = B(X) and at least one of the
hypotheses (1) and (2) in Proposition8.44(d) is valid, so that P is concentrated on
supp(P). For any f : X →C measurable,

X
f (x)d P(x) =

supp(P)
f (x)d P(x) and so

X\supp(P)
f (x)d P(x) = 0 .
(9.38)
The proof is straightforward: χsupp(P) is bounded, by deﬁnition its integral is (χsupp(P)
is simple):

supp(P)
1d P :=

X
χsupp(P)d P = P(supp(P)) = I ,
where Proposition8.44(d) was used in the last equality. Now the second identity in
(9.19) gives

X
f (x)d P(x) =

X
f (x)d P(x)

X
χsupp(P)(x)d P(x) =

supp(P)
χsupp(P)(x) f (x)d P(x)
=:

supp(P)
f (x)d P(x) .
The rest of (9.38) follows, similarly, by using P(X \ supp(P)) = 0.

Example 9.10 (1) Consider the spectral measure:
P : B(N) ∋E 
→PE =

z∈E
z(z| )
of Example8.51(2) on a basis N of a separable Hilbert space H, and equip N with
the second-countable topology of power sets. We are interested in writing an explicit
formula for the integral of an unbounded map f : N →C relying on deﬁnition (9.6).
In the case under exam

N | f (z)|2dμψ(z) < +∞becomes 
z∈N | f (z)|2|(z|ψ)|2 <
+∞. We aim to show

N
f (z)d P(z) = s-

z∈N
f (z)z(z| )
for f unbounded. This formula was proved in Example8.51(2) for f bounded. Sup-
pose {Nn}n∈N are ﬁnite subsets in N, Nn+1 ⊃Nn and ∪n∈NNn = N. The sequence

9.1 Spectral Theorem for Unbounded Self-adjoint Operators
491
of bounded maps fn := χNn · f converges in L2(N, μψ), for any ψ ∈H such
that 
z | f (z)|2|(z|ψ)|2 < +∞, simply by Lebesgue’s dominated convergence. By
deﬁnition (9.6) we have, if 
z∈N | f (z)|2|(z|ψ)|2 < +∞:

N
f (z)d P(z)ψ :=
lim
n→+∞

N
fn(z)d P(z)ψ
(9.39)
But fn is bounded, so Example8.51(2) guarantees

N
fn(z)d P(z)ψ = s-

z∈N
fn(z)(z|ψ) =

z∈Nn
f (z)z(z|ψ) ,
where the sum is ﬁnite for Nn contains a ﬁnite number of points. Deﬁnition (9.39)
reduces to

N
f (z)d P(z)ψ =
lim
n→+∞

z∈Nn
f (z)z(z|ψ) ,
i.e.

N
f (z)d P(z) = s-

z∈N
f (z)z(z| ) .
(9.40)
Later we will see a concrete example of an unbounded self-adjoint operator built
with this type of spectral measure.
(2) Consider the spectral measure of Example8.51. Take the Hilbert space H =
L2(X, μ), with X second countable and μ positive, σ-additive on the Borel σ-algebra
of X. The spectral measure on H we wish to consider is the following. For any
ψ ∈L2(X, μ), E ∈B(X), let
(P(E)ψ)(x) := χE(x)ψ(x) ,
for almost every x ∈X .
(9.41)
With ψ ∈H, the measure μψ is
μψ(E) = (ψ|P(E)ψ) =

E
|ψ(x)|2dμ(x) ,
for any E ∈B(X) .
Consequently if g : X →C is measurable:

X
g(x)dμψ(x) =

X
g(x)|ψ(x)|2dμ(x) .
In Example8.51(1) we saw that if f : X →C is measurable and bounded:


X
f (y) d P(y)ψ
	
(x) = f (x)ψ(x)
for every ψ ∈L2(X, μ) and almost every x ∈X.
(9.42)
This is valid for unbounded measurable maps, too, as long as ψ ∈Δ f . If f : X →C
is unbounded and measurable take a sequence of bounded measurable maps fn such
that fn →f , n →+∞, in L2(X, μψ), with ψ ∈Δ f . In other words, by the above
expression for μψ we take

X
| fn(x) −f (x)|2|ψ(x)|2dμ(x) →0 as n →+∞.
By (9.42):
|| f · ψ −fn · ψ||2
H =

X
| f (x) −fn(x)|2|ψ(x)|2dμ(x) →0 as n →+∞.

9.1.2
Von Neumann Algebra of a Bounded Normal Operator
Corollary9.5 has an important consequence for the von Neumann algebra generated
by a bounded normal operator and the adjoint.
Theorem 9.11 (Von Neumann algebra generated by a bounded normal operator and
its adjoint) Take a normal operator T ∈B(H) with H separable. The von Neumann
algebra generated by T and T ∗(the subspace in B(H) that commutes with every
operator commuting with T and T ∗) consists precisely of the operators f (T, T ∗) of
Theorem8.39, for f ∈Mb(σ(T )).
Proof Indicate by M the von Neumann algebra generated by T , T ∗. We know
that any f (T, T ∗), with f : σ(T ) →C measurable and bounded, belongs to M
by (iii) in Theorem8.39(b) (in the sequel we will need Theorem8.54, the spec-
tral Theorems8.56 and 8.58). Let us show the converse. Clearly M coincides with
the von Neumann algebra generated by the unital ∗-algebra of complex polyno-
mials in T , T ∗(restricted to σ(T ), from now on always assumed). By the dou-
ble commutant theorem (3.88) M is the strong closure of complex polynomials
in T , T ∗. That is to say, if B ∈M there is a sequence of bounded measurable
fn (better: restrictions of polynomials to σ(T )) such that fn(T, T ∗)x →Bx,

9.1 Spectral Theorem for Unbounded Self-adjoint Operators

n →+∞, for any x ∈H. We claim B = f (T, T ∗) for some bounded measur-
able map f deﬁned on σ(T ). As g(T, T ∗) =

σ(T ) gd P(T ) by Theorem8.54(d) for
g bounded and measurable, let {ψα}α∈N ⊂H be an orthonormal system (count-
able since H is separable – the ﬁnite case is alike) as the one of the proof of
Theorem8.58. As in the mentioned proof, build corresponding orthogonal spaces
Hψα ⊂H whose orthogonal sum is H. Each Hψα is invariant under any g(T, T ∗),
and isomorphic to L2(σ(T ), μα), where μα(E) := (ψα|P(T )(E)ψα) are the usual
positive probability measures, P(T ) is the PVM of T and E ⊂σ(T ) a Borel set.
The vector ψα is described in L2(σ(T ), μα) by the constant map 1. The operator
fn(T, T ∗) is described in each L2(σ(T ), μα) by the multiplication by fn. Now look at
x := ⊕α∈N2−α/2ψα ∈H. The sequence fn(T, T ∗)x is a Cauchy sequence by assump-
tion. Expanding H = ⊕α∈NHψα, the inequality || fn(T, T ∗)x −fm(T, T ∗)x||2 < ε,
n, m > Nε, is equivalent to 
α∈N

σ(T ) | fn −fm|22−αdμα < ε, n, m > Nε, by
Theorem8.58(a). Let μ(E) := 
α∈N 2−αμα(E) be a bounded positive Borel mea-
sure. Then the previous condition says { fn}n∈N is Cauchy in L2(σ(T ), μ) (and in
every L2(σ(T ), μα)), so there is a subsequence (of the same name, for simplicity)
converging μ-almost everywhere to a measurable map f ∈L2(σ(T ), μ), possibly
unbounded. Since zero-measure sets for μ are so also for each μα, convergence holds
almost everywhere for P(T ) as well, by Theorem8.58. (In fact for any z = ⊕αφα ∈H
with φα ∈L2(σα(T ), μα), we have (z|P(T )(E)z) = 

Spectral Decomposition of Unbounded Self-adjoint
Operators
The time is right to prove the spectral decomposition theorem for unbounded self-
adjoint operators, exploiting the properties of the Cayley transform. A similar state-
ment is valid also for unbounded (closed) normal operators. The classical proof of

Spectral Theory II: Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
this general proposition can be found in [Rud91], which uses the self-adjoint case,
and thus relies again on the Cayley transform as a crucial tool. A general proof for
(closed) normal unbounded operators, which does not rely on the Cayley transform,
appears in [Schm12]. Extensions of the spectral decomposition theorem of (gener-
ally unbounded) normal operators to quaternionic Hilbert spaces appear in [GMP13]
and [GMP17].
Theorem 9.13 (Spectral decomposition of unbounded self-adjoint operators) Let T
be a self-adjoint (possibly unbounded) operator on the Hilbert space H.
(a) There exists a unique projector-valued measure P(T ) : B(R) →B(H) (R
equipped with the standard topology) such that
T =

R
λ d P(T )(λ) .
(9.44)
(b) P(T ) is concentrated on its support and
supp(P(T )) = σ(T ) .
(9.45)
In particular:
(i) λ ∈σp(T )
⇔
P(T )({λ}) ̸= 0. In this case P(T )({λ}) is the orthogonal
projector onto the λ-eigenspace of T ;
(ii) λ ∈σc(T ) ⇔P(T )({λ}) = 0, and any open set Aλ ⊂R containing λ satisﬁes
P(T )(Aλ) ̸= 0;
(iii) if λ ∈σ(T ) is isolated, then λ ∈σp(T );
(iv) if λ ∈σc(T ), then for any ε > 0 there exists φε ∈D(T ), ||φε|| = 1 with
0 < ||T φε −λφε|| ≤ε .
Proof (a) Let V be the Cayley transform of T , a unitary operator by Theorem5.34
because T is self-adjoint. Setting S1 := {(x, y) ∈R2 | x2 + y2 = 1}, deﬁne
X := S1 \ {(1, 0)} and write z = x + iy. Put on X the topology induced by R2 (or
S1, which is the same) and consider its Borel σ-algebra B(X) ⊂B(S1). Let also
P(V )
0
be the spectral measure of V on S1, stemming from the spectral decomposition
Theorem8.56(a)’. Then
V =

S1 zd P(V )
0
(x, y) .
(9.46)
The operator I −V is one-to-one by (i) in Theorem5.34(b), so 1 = 1 + i0 /∈
σp(V ). This in turn implies P(V )
0
({(1, 0)}) = 0 by (i) in Theorem8.56(b). Consider
orthogonal projectors
P(V ) : B(X) ∋E 
→P(V )
0
(E) ∈L (H) ,
where B(X) ⊂B(S1). By construction P(V ) is a PVM on X (cf. Deﬁnition8.41);
note that P(V )(X) = I because P(V )
0
({(1, 0)}) = 0:

(X) = P(V )
0
(S1\{(1, 0)}) = P(V )
0
(S1)−P(V )
0
({(1, 0)}) = I−0 = I.
For the same reason the integral of a simple map s on S1 in P(V )
0
coincides trivially
with the integral of s ↾X in P(V ). From the construction of the integral of bounded
maps, taking f ∈Mb(S1), hence f ↾X∈Mb(X), it follows that

X f ↾X d P(V ) =

X f d P(V )
0
. However we choose φ, ψ ∈H, E ⊂B(S1):
μ(P(V ))
φ,ψ (E \ {(1, 0)}) = (φ|P(V )(E \ {(1, 0)})ψ) = (φ|P(V )
0
(E \ {(1, 0)})ψ)
= (φ|P(V )
0
(E)ψ) = μ
(P(V )
0
)
φ,ψ (E) ,
(in the obvious notation). Then using the deﬁnition of integral of measurable maps
we ﬁnd

X f ↾X d P(V ) =

X f d P(V )
0
for any f : S1 →C measurable. In particular,
from (9.46) and dropping↾X, we obtain:
V =

X
zd P(V )(x, y) .
(9.47)
Now deﬁne the real-valued, measurable unbounded map on X:
f (z) := i 1 + z
1 −z
z ∈X ,
(9.48)
and integrate it in P(V ) on X, to get the operator (unbounded, in general):
T ′ :=

X
f (z)d P(V )(x, y) .
(9.49)
As f ranges in the reals ((x, y) ∈X), T ′ must be self-adjoint by Theorem9.4(b).
The equation f (z)(1 −z) = i(1 + z), by virtue of Theorem9.4(c), implies:
T ′(I −V ) = i(I + V )
(9.50)
(it is easy to see that there is ‘=’ in (9.14)). In particular (9.50) implies Ran(I −V ) ⊂
Δ f =: D(T ′). From Theorem5.34 we know
T (I −V ) = i(I + V ) and D(T ) = Ran(I −V ) ⊂Δ f .
Comparing with (9.50) allows to conclude T ′ is a self-adjoint extension of T . As
T = T ∗has no proper self-adjoint extension (Proposition5.17(c)), then T = T ′.
Hence
T =

X
f (z)d P(V )(x, y) .
(9.51)

Spectral Theory II: Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
The function f : X →R is actually bijective and so its range is R. From Theo-
rem9.4(h) B(R) ∋E 
→P(T )(E) := P(V )( f −1(E)) is a PVM on R and (9.51)
may be written as in (9.44):
T =

R
λd P(T )(λ) .
But this is exactly the spectral expansion we wanted. So let us pass to the uniqueness
of the measure solving (9.44). Let P′ be a PVM on R with
T =

R
λd P′(λ) .
The Cayley transform, by Theorem9.4(c), reads
V = (T −i I)(T + i I)−1 =

R
λ −i
λ + i d P′(λ) .
Using statement (h) in the same theorem, with the same measurable f : X →R
with measurable inverse (9.48), we ﬁnd
V =

X
zd P′( f (x, y)) ,
where B(X) ∋F 
→Q(F) := P′( f (F)) is a PVM on X which we can extend to a
PVM on S1 by Q0(F) := Q(F \ {(1, 0)}), F ∈B(S1). Thus
V =

S1 zdQ0(x, y) .
By (9.46), then, as the spectral measure associated to a bounded normal operator
is unique by Theorem8.56, necessarily Q0(F) = P(V )
0
(F) for any Borel set in S1.
Hence Q(F) = P(V )(F) for any Borel set of X. Therefore, for any E ∈B(R),
Q( f −1(E)) = P(V )( f −1(E)), i.e. P′(E) = P(T )(E), as required.
(b) First, observe that P(T ) is concentrated on its support since the standard topology
of R is second countable and so (1) in Proposition8.44(d) applies. Now let us show
σ(T ) = supp(P(T )), or equivalently, λ0 ∈ρ(T ) ⇔λ0 /∈supp(P(T )). First of all
we shall prove λ0 /∈supp(P(T )) ⇒λ0 ∈ρ(T ). In fact, there exists an open interval
(a, b) ⊂R \ supp(P(T )), λ0 ∈(a, b). Hence I =

9.1 Spectral Theorem for Unbounded Self-adjoint Operators
497
By Theorem9.4(c), as the last integrand is bounded,
Rλ0(T ) :=

R
1
λ −λ0
d P(T )(λ) ∈B(H) .
Always by Theorem9.4(c) (and keeping an eye on the domains of the products):
Rλ0(T )(T −λ0I) = I ↾D(T ) ,
(T −λ0I)Rλ0(T ) = I .
The second is true everywhere on H, so Ran(T −λ0I) = H. The operator Rλ0(T ) is
therefore the resolvent of T associated to λ0 by Theorem8.4(a), as the name suggests.
By deﬁnition, then, λ0 ∈ρ(T ).
Conversely, let us prove λ0 ∈ρ(T ) ⇒λ0 /∈supp(P(T )). Under the assumptions
on λ0, P(T )({λ0}) = 0, otherwise there would exist ψ ∈P(T )
{λ0}(H) \ {0} such that (by
Theorem9.4(c)):
T ψ =


R
λ0χ{λ0}(λ)d P(T )(λ)ψ = λ0P(T )
{λ0}ψ = λ0ψ
and then ψ ∈σp(T ), contradicting λ0 ∈ρ(T ). Furthermore, the resolvent exists
(as T is closed and by Theorem8.4(a, b)). This is the operator Rλ0(T ) ∈B(H) that
satisﬁes
(T −λ0I)Rλ0(T ) = I
and
Rλ0(T )(T −λ0I) = I ↾D(T ) .
On the other hand Theorem9.4(c) and P(T )({λ0}) = 0 imply

(T −λ0I) = I ↾D(T ) ,

(again, beware of domains). From the ﬁrst we also see that the domain of


R

λ −λ0
d P(T )(λ) = Rλ0(T ) ,
and the operator on the left is bounded. Now suppose by contradiction that λ0 ∈
supp(P(T )). Then any open set containing λ0, in particular any interval In := (λ0 −
1/n, λ0 + 1/n), must satisfy P(T )(In) ̸= 0. Take ψn ∈P(T )
In (H) \ {0} for any
n = 1, 2, . . .. Without loss of generality assume ||ψn|| = 1. Using Theorem9.4(f)
we obtain

We have reached the absurd that Rλ0(T ) cannot be bounded. Therefore λ0
/∈
supp(P(T )).
Let us prove the ﬁrst part of (i); the second part can be proved as we did for the
correspondingpartof(i)inTheorem8.56(b),using(9.22).Asabove,if P(T )({x}) ̸= 0
then x ∈σp(T ).Suppose x ∈σp(T ).BydeﬁnitionofCayleytransform,((x−i)/(x+
i)) ∈σp(V ). We may apply (i) in Theorem8.56(b) to the normal (unitary) operator
V replacing T . Then P(V )({ x−i
x+i }) ̸= 0. Looking at the way the PVM associated to
T was obtained from the PVM of V , we see P(T )(x) = P(V )({ x−i
x+i }) ̸= 0.
Now to (ii). By Proposition8.7(a), x ∈σc(T ) means: (1) x ∈σ(T ) but (2)
x /∈σp(T ). Assertion (1) implies x ∈supp(P(T )), so any open set Ax containing x
must satisfy P(T )(Ax) ̸= 0. Number (2) is equivalent to P(T )({x}) = 0 (otherwise
(i) would give a contradiction).
The proof of (iii) is immediate: if x ∈supp(P(T )) is an isolated point, then
P(T )({x}) ̸= 0, otherwise x could not belong to supp(P(T )), and using (i) the claim
follows.
At last, let us prove (iv). If x ∈σc(T ), using (ii) on the intervals In := (x −
1/n, x + 1/n), n = 1, 2, . . ., we have P(T )(In) ̸= 0. So choose ψn ∈P(T )
In (H) with
||ψn|| = 1 for any n. Then

So for any n = 1, 2, . . . there exists a unit vector ψn with ||T ψn −xψn|| ≤1/n.
The claim follows, since x /∈σp(T ) by assumption, and 0 < ||T ψn −xψn||.

Having eventually settled the spectral theorem we can pass to a deﬁnition useful for
the applications to QM.

9.1 Spectral Theorem for Unbounded Self-adjoint Operators
499
Deﬁnition 9.14 Consider a self-adjoint operator T on the Hilbert space H and a
Borel-measurable map f : σ(T ) →C. The operator:
f (T ) :=

σ(T )
f (x)d P(T )(x) ,
(9.52)
with domain
D( f (T )) = Δ f :=

ψ ∈H


σ(T )
| f (x)|2dμ(T )
ψ (x) < +∞

,
where μ(T )
ψ (E) := (ψ|P(T )(E)ψ) for any E ∈B(σ(T )), is called function of the
operator T .
Since supp(P(T )) = σ(T ), the PVM P(T ) associated to T can be thought of as being
deﬁned either on σ(T ) or on R. Even when deﬁned on σ(T ) only (precisely, on the
Borel σ-algebra B(σ(T ))) we still have supp(P(T )) = σ(T ) by the deﬁnition of
support in the subspace σ(T ) of R with induced topology. Therefore we can view
the right integral in (9.52) as living on R, by extending f trivially (as zero) outside
σ(T ) or directly taking a measurable f : R →C:
f (T ) :=

R
f (x)d P(T )(x) ,
with
D( f (T )) = Δ f :=

.
Inthesequelweshallusethemostconvenientviewpointwithoutfurtherexplanations.
We leave to the reader the obvious check that the deﬁnition of f (T) coincides with
the known one when T ∈B(H), f ∈Mb(σ(T )) (relying on the functional calculus
for bounded measurable functions, cf. Chap.8).
Remarks 9.15
(1) The spectral theorem allows for a second decomposition of the spectrum of a
self-adjoint operator T : D(T ) →H. Its constituents are the discrete spectrum
σd(T ) :=

λ ∈σ(T )
dim

P(T )
(λ−ε,λ+ε)(H)

is ﬁnite for some ε > 0

,
and the essential spectrum σess(T ) := σ(T ) \ σd(T ).
It is not hard to see that λ ∈σd(T )
⇔
λ is an isolated point in σ(T ), and as
such, λ is an eigenvalue for T with ﬁnite-dimensional eigenspace. By Theorem9.13
σd(T ) ⊂σp(T ). In general, though, the opposite inclusion fails, for instance because
there may be non-isolated points in σp(T ).
(2) A third spectral decomposition for a self-adjoint operator T : D(T ) →H arises
by splitting the Hilbert space into the closed span Hp of the eigenvectors and its

500
9
Spectral Theory II: Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
orthogonal complement: H = Hp ⊕H⊥
p . Both Hp ∩D(T ) and H⊥
p ∩D(T ) are easily
T -invariant. With the obvious symbols:
T = T ↾Hp ⊕T ↾H⊥p .
One calls purely continuous spectrum the set σpc(T ) := σ(T ↾H⊥p ), where for
simplicity T ↾H⊥p stands for T ↾D(T )∩H⊥p here and in the sequel. Then σ(T ) = σp(T )∪
σpc(T ). The latter is not necessarily a disjoint union, and in general σpc(T ) ̸= σc(T ).
(3) A fourth spectral decomposition of T : D(T ) →H on the Hilbert space H (and
even on a normed space), is that into approximate point spectrum
σap(T )
:=

λ ∈σ(T ) | (T −λI)−1 : Ran(T −λI) →D(T) does not exist or is not bounded

and purely residual spectrum σpr(T ) := σ(T ) \ σap(T ). The unboundedness of
(T −λI)−1 is equivalent to the existence of δ > 0 with ||(T −λI)ψ|| ≥δ||ψ|| for
any ψ ∈D(T ), so we immediately see how the next result comes about, thereby
justifying the names: λ ∈σap(T ) ⇔there exists a unit vector ψε ∈D(T ) such that
||T ψ −λψ|| ≤ε
for any ε > 0. For self-adjoint operators the above holds for any λ ∈σc(T ) due
to Theorem8.56(b), but clearly also for λ ∈σp(T ); since σ(T ) = σp(T ) ∪σc(T )
in this case, we conclude σap(T ) = σ(T ) and σpr(T ) = ∅for every self-adjoint
operator.
(4) The last partial spectral classiﬁcation for self-adjoint operators (cf. [ReSi80, vol.
I] and [Gra04]) descends from Lebesgue’s Theorem1.77 on the decomposition of
Borel measures on R. If T is self-adjoint on the Hilbert space H and μψ is the spectral
measure of the vector ψ (Theorem8.52(c)), we deﬁne the sets (all closed spaces):
Hac := {ψ ∈H | μψ is absolutely continuous for the Lebesgue measure},
Hsing := {ψ ∈H | μψ is continuous and singular for the Lebesgue measure},
Hpa := {ψ ∈H | μψ is purely atomic (hence singular for the Lebesgue measure)}.
Then set σac(T ) := σ(T ↾Hac), σsing(T ) := σ(T ↾Hsing), respectively called
absolutely continuous spectrum of T and singular spectrum of T . It turns out
that σac(T ) ∪σsing(T ) = σpc(T ) and σp(T ) = σ(T ↾Hpa).
(5) As supp(P(T )) = σ(T ), deﬁnition (9.52) reads:
f (T ) :=

σ(T )
f (x)d P(T )(x) .
(9.53)
Likewise, the domain of f (T ) is

D( f (T )) =



σ(T )
| f (x)|2dμ(T )

,
as supp(μφ,ψ) ⊂supp(P(T )). Eventually, if f : R →R is measurable, decompos-
ing f (T ) (self-adjoint by Theorem9.4(b)) under the spectral Theorem9.13 produces

σ( f (T ))
λd P( f (T ))(λ) =

σ(T )
f (λ)d P(T )(λ) =

σ( f (T ))
λd P(T )( f −1(λ)) .
(9.54)
The last identity follows from Theorem9.4(h). By uniqueness of the PVM associated
to f (T ) we have
P f (T )(E) = P(T )( f −1(E)) for any E ∈B(σ( f (T ))).
(9.55)
(6) Theorem9.3(d) implies that for any self-adjoint T , the standard domain of a
polynomial p(T ) coincides with the domain of p(T ) thought of as function of T
according to Deﬁnition9.14. By deﬁnition of standard domain we also have, for any
self-adjoint T :
D(T m) ⊂D(T n) ,
for any 0 ≤n ≤min N.
(9.56)
■
Functions of an operator enjoy properties that descend directly from Theorems9.3
and 9.4. The next proposition speciﬁes more features of the spectrum of f (T ). In
order to stay general, we shall state the ﬁrst result for spectral measures that do not
necessarily come from self-adjoint operators. But ﬁrst a deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 9.16 If P : B(X) →B(H) is a PVM on the topological space X and
f : X →C is Borel measurable, the essential rank of f with respect to P
ess ran P( f ) ⊂C
is the closed complement of the union of all open sets A ⊂C such that P( f −1(A)) =
0. I.e., z ∈ess ranP( f ) ⇔P( f −1(A)) ̸= 0 if A ⊂C open and z ∈A.
(Note that f −1(A) ∈B(X) since f is Borel measurable and A is open.) If V is the
union of said sets A then P( f −1(V )) = 0, because V is the union of countably many
sets A by Lindelöf’s lemma, and PVMs are sub-additive.
Proposition 9.17 Let P : B(X) →B(H) be a PVM on the topological space X
and f : X →C a Borel measurable map. If Ez := f −1({z}), z ∈C then:

Specialising to the PVM P(T ) : σ(T ) →B(H) of a normal or self-adjoint operator
T , the following results hold for f : σ(T ) →C (Borel measurable).
(b) If f : σ(T ) →C is continuous and T self-adjoint, σ( f (T )) = f (σ(T )), with
bar denoting closure.
(c) If f : σ(T ) →C is continuous and T ∈B(H) normal, σ( f (T )) = f (σ(T )).
(d) If f : σ(T ) →C is measurable and T as in (b) or (c), then σp( f (T )) ⊃
f (σp(T )) (not an equality, in general).
Proof (a) In the sequel Ψ ( f ) :=

X f d P and we assume z = 0 without loss of
generality. Let us prove (i). If P(E0) ̸= 0, there exists x ∈P(E0)(H) with ||x|| = 1.

P(E0), Ψ ( f )x = Ψ ( f )P(E0)x = Ψ ( f )Ψ (χ)x = 0, proving (i).
Now to (ii). By assumption P(E0) = 0, but P(Fn) ̸= 0 if Fn := {s ∈
X || f (s)| < 1/n}, n = 1, 2, . . ., because z ∈ess ranP( f ). Choose xn ∈P(Fn)(H),
||xn|| = 1 and let χn := χFn. As before ||Ψ ( f )xn|| = ||Ψ ( f χn)xn|| ≤||Ψ ( f χn)|| =
|| f χn||∞≤1/n. Therefore Ψ ( f )xn →0, notwithstanding ||xn|| = 1. This shows
that Ψ ( f )−1 (and, similarly, (Ψ ( f )−zI)−1) cannot be bounded if it exists. To show
0 (z in general) is in the continuous spectrum we need prove Ker(Ψ ( f )) = {0} and
Ran(Ψ ( f )) = H. Suppose Ψ ( f )x = 0 for some x ∈Δ f . Then

X
| f |dμx = ||Ψ ( f )x||2 = 0 .
(9.57)
As P( f −1(0)) = 0 and hence (x|P( f −1(0))x) = 0, we have | f | > 0 almost every-
where for μx, so that (9.57) entails 0 = μx(X) = ||x||2. That is, Ker(Ψ ( f )) = {0}.
To ﬁnish part (ii) we prove Ran(Ψ ( f )) = H. Since Ψ ( f )∗= Ψ ( f ), the same argu-
ment used above tells Ker(Ψ ( f )∗) = {0} and Ran(Ψ ( f )) = (Ker(Ψ ( f )∗)⊥)⊥=
{0}⊥= H.
There remains the ﬁrst assertion in (a). By (i)–(ii) we have ess ran P( f ) ⊂
σ(Ψ ( f )). For the opposite inclusion assume z = 0 /∈ess ran P( f ) (z ̸= 0 is
analogous). Then f ′ := 1/f is bounded and f f ′ = 1, so ψ( f )Ψ ( f ′) = I and
Ran(Ψ ( f )) = H. Since | f | > 0, Ψ ( f ) is one-to-one as in case (ii). Therefore
Ψ ( f )−1 ∈B(H) by the closed graph theorem. This ends the proof because Theo-
rem8.4(a) implies 0 /∈σ(Ψ ( f )).
(b) Recall supp(P(T )) = σ(T ) (viewing P(T ) on C, or only on σ(T ) if we
use the induced topology). Certainly f (supp(P(T ))) ⊂ran essP( f ) (if z ∈
f (supp(P(T ))), for any open set A ⊂C, A ∋z, the open set f −1(A) includes x ∈
supp(P(T )) with f (x) = z and so P(T )( f −1(A)) ̸= 0 otherwise x /∈supp(P(T ))).
Because ran essP(T )( f ) is closed, we have f (supp(P(T ))) ⊂ran essP(T)( f ). If
z ∈ran essP(T )( f ) but z /∈f (supp(P(T ))), there would be an open set A ∋z
not intersecting f (supp(P(T ))). Thus P(T )( f −1(A)) = P(T )(∅) = 0, which cannot
be by deﬁnition of ran essP(T )( f ).

9.1 Spectral Theorem for Unbounded Self-adjoint Operators
503
(c) The statement is straightforward from (b): if T ∈B(H), then the spectrum
σ(T ) is compact and its continuous image in C under f is compact, so closed and
f (σ(T )) = f (σ(T )).
(d) If λ ∈σp(T ) then P(T )({λ}) ̸= 0. If x ∈P(T )({λ})(H)\{0}, using Theorem9.4(c)
we get f (T )x = f (T )χ{λ}(T )x = f (λ)x, hence f (λ) ∈σp( f (T )).
Here is an example where σp( f (T )) ⊋f (σp(T )) for T = T ∗. Take (a, b) ⊂σc(T )
so that P(T )((a, b)) ̸= 0. If f is measurable, it equals a constant c > 0 on (a, b)
and f (λ) = 0 outside the interval, so c ∈σp( f (T )) by (i) in (a). But c /∈f (σp(T ))
(which at most includes 0 < c) and hence σp( f (T )) ⊋f (σp(T )).

Example of Operator with Point Spectrum: The
Hamiltonian of the Harmonic Oscillator
On the complex Hilbert space L2(R, dx) (dx is the Lebesgue measure on R) consider
the operator
H0 := 1

P ↾S (R)
2 + mω2
2

X ↾S (R)

where X, P are the position and momentum operators for a particle moving on the
real line, seen in Chap.5. In other terms
H0 := −ℏ2
2m
d2
dx2 + mω2
2
x2 ,
where x2 stands for the multiplication by R ∋x 
→x2 and ℏ, ω, m are positive
constants. Deﬁne D(H0) := S (R), where S (R) is the Schwartz space of R, i.e.
the space of smooth complex functions that vanish at inﬁnity, together with any
derivative, faster than any negative power of x (see Example2.91).
The numbers ℏ, ω, m have no mathematical relevance (and could be set to 1 in the
sequel), yet it is their physical meaning that is important. The operator H0 is called
the Hamiltonian of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with characteristic
frequency ω/(2π) for a particle of mass m, and h := 2πℏis Planck’s constant. Note
that H0 is not an observable as it is not self-adjoint. However, its closure H0 is self-
adjoint: it is the energy observable of the system under exam. In this section we shall
not be concerned with the physical background, and just study the operator from
a mathematical perspective, leaving any comment about the physics to Chaps.12
and 13.
Evidently H0 issymmetric,asHermitianandbecauseS (R)isdensein L2(R, dx).
Moreover, it admits self-adjoint extensions by von Neumann’s criterion (Theo-
rem5.43), for it commutes with the (anti-unitary) complex conjugation of L2(R, dx).
We will show H0 is essentially self-adjoint, provide an explicit expression for it in
terms of the spectral expansion of its unique self-adjoint extension H0, and also
describe the spectrum.

Spectral Theory II: Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
Let us introduce three operators, called creation operator, annihilation operator
and number operator:
A⋆:=
mω
2ℏ

x −ℏ
mω
d
dx
	
,
A :=
mω
2ℏ

x +
ℏ
mω
d
dx
	
,
N := A⋆A .
(9.58)
In this case, as well, we assume the operators are densely deﬁned on D(A) =
D(A⋆) = D(N ) := S (R). It should be clear that A⋆⊂A∗, justifying the notation,
and N is further symmetric. Notice S (R) is dense and invariant under H0, A, A⋆.
Using A, A⋆we will build eigenvectors for N and H0 that form a basis in L2(R, dx).
As eigenvectors are obviously analytic vectors, by Nelson’s criterion (Theorem5.47)
H0 and N are essentially self-adjoint on their domain S (R).
We start by observing that, by deﬁnition, the commutation relation
[A, A⋆] = I ,
(9.59)
holds, where either side acts on the dense invariant space S (R).1 The proof is
immediate. What is more, still by deﬁnition,
H0 = ℏω

A⋆A + 1
2 I


N + 1
2 I
	
.
(9.60)
Consider the equation in S (R):
Aψ0 = 0 ,
(9.61)
A solution is, easily,
ψ0(x) =
1
π1/4√s e−x2
2s2 ,
s :=

ℏ
mω ,
where the factor was chosen so to normalise ||ψ0|| = 1. The function ψ0 is the
ﬁrst Hermite function introduced in Example3.32(4), provided we use the variable
x′ = x/s and consider the factor 1/√s not to destroy the normalisation. Now deﬁne
vectors:
ψn := (A⋆)n
√
n!
ψ0
(9.62)
for n = 1, 2, . . .. Only using (9.61), (9.59) it is easy to prove by induction that
Aψn = √nψn−1 ,
A⋆ψn =
√
n + 1ψn+1 ,
(ψn|ψm) = δnm ,
(9.63)
n, m ∈N. The second identity actually follows from the deﬁnition of the ψn, whilst
the ﬁrst is proved like this:
1More appropriately, identity (9.59) should be written [A, A⋆] ⊂I.

[A, (A⋆)n]ψ0 + 0 ;
but (9.59) implies [A, (A⋆)n] = n(A⋆)n−1, substituting which above gives what
needed. Here is the proof of the third identity (for n ≥m, the other case is similar):
(ψm|ψn) =
1
√
n!m
(ψm−1|A(A⋆)nψ0) =

m (ψm−1|ψn−1) = · · · =

n!
m!(n −m)!(ψ0|ψn−m) .
If n = m the result is 1, otherwise 0, for
(ψ0|ψn−m) = (n −m)−1/2(ψ0|A⋆ψn−m−1) = (n −m)−1/2(Aψ0|ψn−m−1) = 0 .
The second equation in (9.63) (the normalisation is preserved when using x′ = x/s
because of 1/√s) is the recurrence relationship of Hermite functions mentioned in
Example3.32(4). Hence the ψn are (up to a multiplicative constant and a change of
variable) Hermite functions, and so they are a basis of L2(R, dx). The last equation
in (9.63) implies {ψn}n∈N is, as it should, an orthonormal system in L2(R, dx); the
ﬁrst two tell
N ψn = nψn ,
(9.64)
so by (9.60) the ψn are a Hilbert basis of eigenvectors of H0, as:
H0ψn = ℏω

n + 1
2
	
ψn .
(9.65)
By the way this proves H0 (but also N ) is unbounded, since the set {||H0ψ|| | ψ ∈
D(H0) , ||ψ|| = 1} contains all numbers ℏω(n + 1/2), n ∈N. By Nelson’s criterion
(Theorem5.47) the symmetric operators N , H0 are both essentially self-adjoint,
since their domains contain a set {ψn}n∈N of analytic vectors spanning a dense subset
in L2(R, dx).
To obtain the spectral decomposition of H0, construct a spectral measure on R
with support on the naturals n ∈N:
PF := s-

n∈F∩N
ψn(ψn| ) for F ∈B(R).
The PVM we have found can be reinterpreted as a PVM deﬁned on N, identiﬁed with
N := {ψn}n∈N. Following in the footsteps of Example9.10(1), for any measurable
map f : R →C we have

(9.66)
We claim H = H0. Let < N > be the dense space spanned by ﬁnite combinations
of the ψn. By Nelson’s criterion H0 ↾<N> is still essentially self-adjoint. Therefore
H0 = H0 ↾<N>, i.e. H0 and H0 ↾<N> have the same (unique) self-adjoint extension
(their closure). On the other hand H is certainly a self-adjoint extension of H0 ↾<N>,
because (9.66) implies
Hψn = ω

n + 1
2
	
ψn = H0ψn
for any n, and so H ↾<N>= H0 ↾<N>. Therefore H must be the unique self-adjoint
extension of H0 ↾<N>, hence of H0. This means H = H0, as was claimed. Under
the spectral decomposition Theorem9.13 the spectral measure associated to H0 is
B(R) ∋F 
→PF, and we also have the spectral decomposition of H0 into
H0 = s-

We must remark that the spectrum of H0 is a point spectrum and eigenspaces are all
ﬁnite-dimensional, even though the operator itself is not compact (it is unbounded).
Yet the ﬁrst and second inverse powers of H0 are compact, for they are a Hilbert–
Schmidt operator and a trace-class operator respectively (exercise).
The numbers in σp(H0) are, physically, the levels of total mechanical energy that
a quantum oscillator may assume for given ω, m, in contrast to the classical case
where the energy varies with continuity.

Examples with Continuous Spectrum: The Operators
Position and Momentum
We return to the operators position (5.12)–(5.13) and momentum (5.18)–(5.19) on
the Hilbert space H = L2(R3, dx) with Lebesgue measure. In the sequel we shall
set x = (x1, x2, x3). We saw that Xi and Pi, i = 1, 2, 3, are self-adjoint, and we set
out to determine their spectra and spectral expansion.
Start by the position operator X1. The ﬁndings will work for X2 and X3 by
swapping names. A PVM on R with values in B(H) = B(L2(R3, dx)) is
(P(E)ψ)(x1, x2, x3) = χE(x1)ψ(x1, x2, x3) for any E ∈B(R), ψ ∈L2(R3, dx).
(9.67)
If ψ ∈L2(R3, dx), it is easy to see the measure μψ on B(R) is deﬁned by:
μψ(E) =

E×R2 |ψ(x1, x2, x3)|2dx ,
E ∈B(R),
so

R
g(y)dμψ(y) =

E×R2 f (x1)ψ(x1, x2, x3)dx
(9.68)
for g : R →C Borel measurable. In analogy to Example9.10(2) it is easy to check,
for f : R →C Borel measurable and ψ ∈Δ f (i.e.

R | f (x1)ψ(x1, x2, x3)|2dx <
+∞), that

R
f (y)d P(y)ψ
	
(x1, x2, x3) = f (x1)ψ(x1, x2, x3) a.e. for (x1, x2, x3) ∈R3.
(9.69)
We can then introduce the operator X′
1 associated, in (9.69), to the map f := f1 :
R ∋y 
→y. It is self-adjoint by Theorem9.4(b), as the map is real. By comparison
with (5.13) we infer Δ f1 = D(X1), and from (9.69) we get
X′
1ψ = X1ψ
for any ψ ∈D(X1).
The spectral decomposition Theorem9.13 warrants uniqueness of the spectral mea-
sure, whence (9.67) is the spectral measure associated to X1. The spectral expansion
of Xi, i = 1, 2, 3, must therefore be

R
yd P(Xi)(y)ψ
	
(x1, x2, x3) = (Xiψ)(x1, x2, x3) a.e. for (x1, x2, x3) ∈R3,
(9.70)
where
(P(Xi)(E)ψ)(x1, x2, x3) = χE(xi)ψ(x1, x2, x3) ∀E ∈B(R), ψ ∈L2(R3, dx).
(9.71)

Spectral Theory II: Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
This spectral measure allows to ﬁnd the spectrum of Xi, i = 1, 2, 3. Applying (ii) in
Theorem9.13(b) immediately gives
σ(Xi) = σc(Xi) = R .
(9.72)
Nowtomomenta.TheargumentisratherstraightforwardbecauseofProposition5.31,
since the Fourier-Plancherel transform is unitary. As such, it preserves spectra (Exer-

σ(Pi) = σ(ℏˆ
F −1Ki ˆ
F) = ℏR = R ,
i.e.
σ(Pi) = σc(Pi) = R .
(9.73)
The spectral measure of Pi must be supported on the whole R. The reader may prove
easily, using Proposition5.31 and Exercises9.1–9.4, that the PVM associated to the
momentum Pi is just
P(Pi)(E) =
ˆ
F −1P(Ki) ˆ

E ∈B(R).
(9.74)
where P(Ki) is the spectral measure of Ki.

Spectral Representation of Unbounded Self-adjoint
Operators
The next spectral representation generalises Theorem8.58 to self-adjoint unbounded
operators. The details are left as exercise, as they essentially replicate the proof of
Theorem8.58.
Theorem 9.18 (Spectral representation of unbounded self-adjoint operators) Let H
be a Hilbert space, T : D(T ) →H a self-adjoint operator on H, P(T ) the PVM of
T over Borel sets of σ(T ) according to Theorem9.13.
(a) H may be decomposed as a Hilbert sum H = ⊕α∈AHα (A countable, at most, if
H is separable), whose summands Hα are closed and orthogonal. Moreover:
(i) for any α ∈A and any measurable map f : σ(T ) →C,
f (T )(Hα ∩D( f (T ))) ⊂Hα ,
in particular
T (Hα ∩D(T )) ⊂Hα ,

9.1 Spectral Theorem for Unbounded Self-adjoint Operators
509
(ii) for any α ∈A there exist a unique ﬁnite positive Borel measure μα on
σ(T ) ⊂R, and a surjective isometric operator Uα : Hα →L2(σ(T), μα), such
that:
Uα

σ(T )

for any measurable f : σ(T ) →C. In particular
UαT ↾Hα∩D(T ) U −1
α

where f · is the multiplication by f on L2(σ(T ), μα):
( f · g)(x) = f (x)g(x)
a.e. on σ(T )if g ∈D( f ·),
and
D( f ·) := {g ∈L2(σ(T ), μα) | f · g ∈L2(σ(T ), μα)} .
(b) We have
σ(T ) =

α∈A
supp(μα) .
(c) If H is separable, there exist a measure space (MT , ΣT , μT ), μT (MT ) < +∞, a
map FT : MT →R and a unitary operator UT : H →L2(MT , μT ) such that:

UT TU −1
T


(m) = FT (m) f (m) ,
f ∈L2(MT , μT ),U −1
T
f ∈D(T ).
(9.75)
Proof The proof mimics Theorem8.58 for T self-adjoint and any Hψ. Apart from
the obvious adaptations, it sufﬁces to replace bounded measurable maps Mb(σ(T ))
with the space L2(σ(T ), μψ), paying attention to domains.
□
9.1.7
Joint Spectral Measures
The ﬁnal notion of this section is the joint spectral measure of self-adjoint operators
with commuting spectral measures.
Theorem 9.19 (Joint spectral measure) Let A := {A1, A2, . . . , An} be a set of self-
adjoint operators (even unbounded) on the separable Hilbert space H, and suppose
the associated spectral measures P(Ak) commute:
P(Ak)(E)P(Ah)(E′) = P(Ah)(E′)P(Ak)(E) ,
E, E′ ∈B(R), h, k ∈{1, 2, . . . , n}.

Spectral Theory II: Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
Then there exists a unique PVM P(A) : B(Rn) →B(H) such that
P(A)(E(1)×· · ·×E(n)) = P(A1)(E(1)) · · · P(An)(E(n)),
E(k) ∈B(R), k = 1, . . . , n.
(9.76)
This PVM P(A) is called the joint spectral measure of A1, A2, . . . , An and
supp(P(A)) is the joint spectrum of A.
For any measurable f : R →C:

Rn f (xk(x))d P(A)(x) =

R
f (xk)d P(Ak)(xk) = f (Ak) ,
k = 1, 2, . . . , n,
(9.77)
where xk(x) is the kth component of x = (x1, x2, . . . , xk . . . , xn) ∈Rn.
Proof We need a couple of technical lemmas.
Lemma 9.20 Let H be a Hilbert space, {Pα}α∈A ⊂L (H) an inﬁnite family of
orthogonal projectors such that Pα Pα′ = Pα′ Pα = Pβ for any α, α′ ∈A and some
β ∈A depending on α, α′. Deﬁne Ma := Pα(H), M := ∩α∈AMα and let PM be the
orthogonal projector onto M.
(a) If H is separable, there exists a countable subfamily {Mαm}m∈N such that
∩m∈NMαm = M.
(b) (ψ|PMψ) = infα∈A(ψ|Pαψ) for any ψ ∈H.
Proof (a) We have H\M = ∪α∈A(H\Mα), where the H\Mα form an open covering
of H \ M. As H is separable, it is second countable (see Remark2.86(2) because
the topology of H is induced by the norm distance). By Theorem1.8 we can take a
countable subcovering H \ M = ∪m∈N(H \ Mαm). Now we take complements in H,
and obtain (a).
(b) Noting that P1 ≥P2 for orthogonal projectors means (x|P1x) ≥(x|P2x) for all
x ∈H, the claim is nothing but item (i) in Theorem7.22(a).
□
Lemma 9.21 Let A be an algebra (Deﬁnition1.30) or a σ-algebra of subsets in X.
If P : A →L (H), with H a Hilbert space, satisﬁes (c) and (d) in deﬁnition 8.41
(the latter if ∪n En ∈A ), then it also satisﬁes (a) and (b) of that deﬁnition.
Proof The proof is the same as for Proposition8.44(a).
□
It is easy to see that ﬁnite unions of products E(1) × · · · × E(n), with E(k) ∈B(R),
form an algebra of sets, denoted B0(Rn); the same can be obtained by taking disjoint
ﬁnite unions of products (just decompose further in case of non-empty intersections).
The σ-algebra generated by B0(Rn) contains countable unions of products of open
balls in R: as Rn is second countable, the σ-algebra includes all open sets in Rn, so
a fortiori the Borel σ-algebra B(Rn), and then it must coincide with the latter.

Since P(Ak)(E(k)

projector that commutes with every other Q(S′). It is not hard to prove B0(Rn) ∋
S

n∈S Q(Sn) ∈P(H) exists when
Sk ∩Sh = ∅, h ̸= k. Moreover the ‘strong’ sum equals Q(∪k∈NSk) if ∪k∈NSk ∈
B0(Rn).ApplyingLemma9.21gives Q(S1)Q(S2) = Q(S1∩S2)if S1, S2 ∈B0(Rn).
If R ∈B(Rn) let P(A)(R) be the projector onto the intersection of all projection
spaces of 
k Q(Sk), for any family {Sk}k∈N ⊂B0(Rn) such that Sk ∩Sh = ∅
for h ̸= k, ∪n∈NSk ⊃R. By construction P(A)(Rn) = I: if ∪k∈NSk = Rn, for
R ∈B0(Rn), σ-additivity implies 
k Q(Sk) = Q(Rn) = I. The latter projects
onto H, so P(Rn) = I. Using Lemma9.20, with ψ ∈H:

As consequence of Theorem1.41, for ψ ∈H, B(Rn) ∋E

deﬁnes a positive σ-additive ﬁnite measure on B(Rn), namely the unique extension
of B0(Rn) ∋S

is a projector, (c) by construction and (d) by σ-additivity of B(Rn) ∋E 
→
(ψ|P(A)(R)φ). Eventually, (b) follows from Lemma9.21. The identity P(A)(E(1) ×
· · · × E(n)) = P(A1)(E(1)) · · · P(An)(E(n)) implies P(A)(Π−1
k (E(k))) = P(Ak)(E(k))
for any E(k) ∈B(R), where Πk : Rn →R is the kth canonical projection
of Rn = R × · · · × R. Using Theorem9.4(h) with φ := Πk and the spectral
Theorem9.13 for Ak gives

Rn f (Πk(x))d P(A)(x) =

R
f (xk)d P(Ak)(xk) = f (Ak) ,
k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Now, every PVM P′ : B(R) →L (H) satisfying
P′(E(1) × · · · × E(n)) = P(A1)(E(1)) · · · P(An)(E(n))
for any E(k) ∈B(R) must also satisfy
(ψ|P′(E(1) × · · · × E(n))ψ) = (ψ|P(A1)(E(1)) · · · P(An)(E(n))ψ) .

Spectral Theory II: Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
As positive measures doing just that are unique, we have (ψ|P′(R)ψ) = (ψ|P(A)
(R)ψ) for any R ∈B(Rn) and any ψ ∈H. Therefore P(A) = P′, since the previous
relation, by polarisation, implies (ψ|P′(R)φ) = (ψ|P(A)(R)φ) for ψ, φ ∈H. □
An exhaustive discussion on joint spectral measures, their integrals, and the mean-
ing in QM can be found in [Pru81] and [BeCa81]. In analogy to Theorem9.11 we
could prove what follows (see [BeCa81], and Exercise9.6 for n = 1). An introduc-
tory deﬁnition is necessary.
Deﬁnition 9.22 Let A = {A1, . . . , An} be a collection of self-adjoint operators on
the Hilbert space H. The commutant of A, denoted by A′, is the von Neumann
algebra made of all elements of B(H) that commute with the spectral measures of
each Ak ∈A.
We leave to the reader to prove that this deﬁnition reduces to the standard one if
A ⊂B(H), and to the deﬁnition in Remark5.13(4) when n = 1.
Proposition 9.23 Let A = {A1, . . . , An} be a collection of self-adjoint opera-
tors on the separable Hilbert space H whose spectral measures commute. The
von Neumann algebra A′′ (the set of operators in B(H) commuting with operators in
B(H) that commute with all spectral measures) coincides with the collection of oper-
ators f (A1, . . . , An) :=

supp(P(A)) f (x1, . . . , xn)d P(A) with f : supp(P(A)) →C
measurable and bounded.
If f is real-valued, f (A1, . . . , An) is self-adjoint: interpreted as an observable, it is
a function of the observables A1, . . . , An of the quantum system. This corresponds
to the notion of Remark7.47(2).

Exponential of Unbounded Operators: Analytic Vectors
This section is short and technical. We go back to analytic vectors, introduced at
the end of Chap.5, and uncover other properties in the light of the theory developed
since. The results will be used at various places in the rest of the book.
Here is an interesting general problem. If A is a self-adjoint operator on the Hilbert
space H, the exponential ezA can be deﬁned as a function of A (Deﬁnition9.14). We
expect, in some cases, to be able to employ the Taylor expansion:
ezA =
+∞

n=0
zn
n! An ,
using Deﬁnition9.14 for the left-hand side. If A ∈B(H) the above identity does
hold, provided we understand the expansion in the uniform topology, as is easy to
see (Exercise8.16). If A is not bounded, the issue is subtler and the above equation
makes no sense in the uniform topology. As Nelson clariﬁed, it has a meaning in

9.2 Exponential of Unbounded Operators: Analytic Vectors
513
the strong topology and over a dense subspace in the Hilbert space, which is a core
for A: we shall prove in Proposition9.25 that this dense core is the space of analytic
vectors for A.
Let A be an operator with domain D(A) on the Hilbert space H. Recall (Deﬁni-
tion5.44) that a vector ψ ∈D(A) such that Anψ ∈D(A) for any n ∈N (A0 := I)
is called a C∞vector for A. The subspace of C∞vectors for A is written C∞(A).
Furthermore, ψ ∈C∞(A) is an analytic vector for A if
+∞

for some t > 0.
(9.78)
Recall also Nelson’s Theorem5.47, for which a symmetric operator on a Hilbert
space is essentially self-adjoint if its domain contains analytic vectors whose ﬁnite
combinations are dense.
Notation 9.24 If A is an operator on H with domain D(A), we shall indicate by
A (A) the subset in C∞(A) of elements satisfying (9.78).
■
The next proposition discusses useful properties of analytic vectors, in particular the
exponential of (self-adjoint) unbounded operators.
Proposition 9.25 Let A be an operator on the Hilbert space H.
(a) A (A) is a vector space.
(b) If A is closable:
A (A) ⊂A (A) .
(c) (i) For any c ∈C, deﬁning A + cI on its standard domain:
A (A + cI) = A (A) .
(ii) For any c ∈C \ {0}, deﬁning cA on its standard domain:
A (cA) = A (A) .
(iii) If A is Hermitian, deﬁning A2 on its standard domain:
A (A2) ⊂A (A) .
(d) If A is self-adjoint and ψ ∈A (A) ∩D(ezA), viewing ezA as in Deﬁnition9.14:
ezAψ =
+∞

n=0
zn
n! Anψ
for any z ∈C, |z| ≤t, and t satisfying (9.78) for ψ . (9.79)
If Rez = 0, equation (9.79) holds for ψ ∈A (A), provided |z| ≤t and t solves
(9.78) for the given ψ.

Spectral Theory II: Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
(e) If A is self-adjoint, viewing ezA as in Deﬁnition9.14:
eis A(A (A)) ⊂A (A) ,
s ∈R.
(f) If A is self-adjoint, D(A) contains a dense subset made of analytic vectors for
p(A) for any t > 0 in (9.78) (where A is replaced by p(A)) and for any complex
polynomial p(A) of A.
Proof (a) The claim follows from the estimate
||An(aψ + bφ)|| ≤|a| ||Anψ|| + |b| ||Anφ|| ,
ψ, φ ∈A (A), by choosing t > 0 small enough to satisfy (9.78) for ψ and φ.
(b) This is a direct consequence of the deﬁnitions, for A is an extension of A and so
A
n extends An.
(c) To prove (i), note that if t > 0 satisﬁes (9.78) for ψ, then:

The Fubini–Tonelli theorem on the counting product measure of N allows us to
compute the product of the series (integral in the product measure) as a double
integral in:

Therefore A (A + cI) ⊃A (A). Now deﬁne A′ := A + cI, so A = A′ + c′I and
c′ = −c. It follows that A (A′ + c′I) ⊃A (A′), which is equivalent to A (A) ⊃
A (A + cI), so A (A) = A (A + cI). Property (ii) is obvious by deﬁnition, so
let us see to (iii). By construction C∞(A) = C∞(A2). Since A is Hermitian and
√x ≤1 + x for x ≥0, in C∞(A) we have:
||Anψ|| =

(ψ|A2nψ) ≤

||ψ||

||A2nψ|| ≤

||ψ||(1 + ||(A2)nψ||) .
The claim is therefore true, since for t > 0:

where (9.78) is needed in the last passage. Then Theorem1.87 (for that |h| = 1 a.e.)
and Fubini–Tonelli imply, for |z| ≤t, that we may swap sum and integral:

Hence for |z| ≤t, if ψ belongs to the domain of ezA (cf. Deﬁnition9.14) and by

As φ is arbitrary, we have (9.79). In case Rez = 0, i.e. z = is, s ∈R, the map

(e) If A is self-adjoint, by Theorem9.4(c) eis A(eis A)∗= (eis A)∗eis A = I, so eis A is
unitary. Using Theorem9.4(c) with ψ ∈A (A) ⊂C∞(A) produces Aneis Aψ =
eis A Anψ, but eis A is unitary and ||eis A Anψ|| = ||Anψ||, whence the claim follows.
(f) Consider the spectral decomposition A =

R xd P(A)(x), partition the real line
R = ∪n∈Z(n, n+1] and take its closed, pairwise-orthogonal subspaces Hn = Pn(H),
where we deﬁne projectors Pn :=

Hn for any n, the union of all bases is a basis of H. Notice supp(μψ(n)
k ) ⊂(n, n+1] by
deﬁnition of μφ (Theorem8.52). From Theorem9.4(e) every ψ(n)

since


(n,n+1] |x|2mdμψ(n)
k (x) ≤|n + 1|2m||ψ(n)
k ||2. Finite
linear combinations are, by construction, a dense subspace in H, and analytic for A
(for any t > 0) by (a).
Now take a complex polynomial pN(x) = N
k=0 xn of degree N, and deﬁne
pN(A) on the domain D(pN(A)) = D(AN) (Theorem9.4(d)). We will check every
ψ(n)
k

Choose one of them of unit norm, say ψ, and suppose its spectral measure μψ has
support in some interval (−L, L]. Then ||Akψ|| ≤Lk||ψ|| = Lk. Therefore

Strongly Continuous One-Parameter Unitary Groups
The goal of this section is to prove Stone’s theorem, one of the most important results
in view of the applications to QM (and not only that). To state it we will present some
preliminary results about one-parameter groups of unitary operators, and in particular
an important theorem due to von Neumann.

9.3 Strongly Continuous One-Parameter Unitary Groups
517
9.3.1
Strongly Continuous One-Parameter Unitary Groups,
von Neumann’s Theorem
Deﬁnition 9.26 (One-parameter group of operators) Let H be a Hilbert space. A
collection {Ut}t∈R ⊂B(H) is called a one-parameter group (of operators) on H if
U0 = I
and UtUs = Ut+sfor any t, s ∈R
(9.80)
A one-parameter group {Ut}t∈R ⊂B(H) is said:
(a) one-parameter unitary group if Ut is unitary for any t ∈R,
(b) weakly continuous at t0 ∈R, or strongly continuous at t0 ∈R, if the mapping
t 
→Ut is continuous at t0 in the weak, resp. strong, topology (and R is standard);
(c) weakly continuous or strongly continuous if it is weakly, or strongly, continuous
at each point of R.
By (9.80), if the Ut are unitary:
(Ut)∗= U −1
t
= U−t ,
for any t ∈R .
(9.81)
Proposition 9.27 Let{Ut}t∈R beaone-parameterunitarygroupontheHilbertspace
(H, (·|·)). The following assertions are equivalent.
(a) (ψ|Utψ) →(ψ|ψ) as t →0 for any ψ ∈H.
(b) {Ut}t∈R is weakly continuous at t = 0.
(c) {Ut}t∈R is weakly continuous.
(d) {Ut}t∈R is strongly continuous at t = 0.
(e) {Ut}t∈R is strongly continuous.
Proof First, let us number the properties.
(1) {Ut}t∈R is weakly continuous at t = 0.
(2) (ψ|Utψ) →(ψ|ψ) as t →0 for any ψ ∈H.
(3) {Ut}t∈R is strongly continuous at t = 0.
(4) {Ut}t∈R is strongly continuous.
(5) {Ut}t∈R is weakly continuous.
We will show (1) ⇒(2) ⇒(3) ⇒(4) ⇒(5) ⇒(1).
(1) ⇒(2). Weak continuity at t = 0 implies, when t →0, that (ψ|Utψ) →
(ψ|U0ψ) = (ψ|ψ) and (Utψ|ψ) →(U0ψ|ψ) = (ψ|ψ) by conjugation.
(2) ⇒(3). Strong continuity at t = 0 amounts to saying, for any ψ ∈H,
||Utψ −U0ψ|| →0
as t →0. Since U0 = I, squaring and writing norms via inner products transforms
the above into
(Utψ|Utψ) −(ψ|Utψ) −(Utψ|ψ) + (ψ|ψ) →0 .

518
9
Spectral Theory II: Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
But Ut unitary implies (Utψ|Utψ) = (ψ, ψ), so the identity reads
(ψ|ψ) −(ψ|Utψ) −(Utψ|ψ) + (ψ, ψ) →0 ,
as t →0 .
As we said at the beginning, the latter holds if (2) does.
(3) ⇒(4). If ψ ∈H:
Utψ −Ut0ψ = Ut(ψ −U −1
t
Ut0ψ) = Ut(ψ −Ut0−tψ) ,
where (9.81) was used. As Ut is unitary, for any ψ ∈H:
||Usψ −Ut0ψ|| = ||Us(ψ −Ut0−sψ)|| = ||ψ −Ut0−sψ|| .
Under strong continuity at t = 0, since t0 −s →0 for s →t0, we ﬁnd ||Usψ −
Ut0ψ|| →0. Hence strong continuity at t = 0 forces strong continuity at any t0 ∈R.
(4) ⇒(5). Obvious because strong convergence implies weak convergence.
(5) ⇒(1). True by deﬁnition.
□
Here is another property of unitary groups.
Proposition 9.28 Let{Ut}t∈R beaone-parameterunitarygroupontheHilbertspace
(H, (·|·)), and H ⊂H a subset such that:
(a) the ﬁnitely-generated span < H > is dense in H,
(b) (ψ|Utψ) →(ψ|ψ), as t →0, for any ψ ∈H .
Then {Ut}t∈R is a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group.
Proof The same argument used in Proposition9.27 gives that (φ0|Utφ0) →(φ0|φ0),
as t →0, for φ0 ∈H implies ||Utφ0 −φ0|| →0, t →0. If, more generally,
φ ∈< H > then φ = 
i∈I ciφ0i where I is ﬁnite and φ0i ∈H . Hence as t →0
||Utφ −φ|| =

i
ci(Utφ0i −φ0i)


≤

i
|ci|||Utφ0i −φ0i|| →0 .
By Proposition9.27 it now sufﬁces to extend this to H. That is to say, ||Utφ−φ|| →0,
as t →0, for any φ ∈< H > implies ||Utψ −ψ|| →0, t →0, for any ψ ∈H.
As < H > is dense, for any given ψ ∈H there is a sequence {ψn}n∈N ⊂< H >
with ψn →φ, n →+∞. If {tm}m∈N is a real inﬁnitesimal sequence, by the triangle
inequality
||Utmψ −ψ|| ≤||Utmψ −Utmφn|| + ||Utmφn −φn|| + ||φn −ψ||
for any given n ∈N. Since the Utm are unitary and the norm non-negative, that means

9.3 Strongly Continuous One-Parameter Unitary Groups
519
0 ≤||Utmψ −ψ|| ≤||Utmφn −φn|| + 2||φn −ψ|| .
(9.82)
For ﬁxed n, ||Utmφn −φn|| →0, m →+∞, by assumption, so:
lim sup
m
||Utmφn −φn|| = lim inf
m
||Utmφn −φn|| =
lim
m→+∞||Utmφn −φn|| = 0 .
By (9.82), for any n ∈N:
0 ≤lim sup
m
||Utmψ −ψ|| ≤2||φn −ψ||,
0 ≤lim inf
m
||Utmψ −ψ|| ≤2||φn −ψ||.
On the other hand for n large enough we can make ||φn −ψ|| inﬁnitesimal, so:
lim sup
m
||Utmψ −ψ|| = lim inf
m
||Utmψ −ψ|| = 0 .
Therefore
lim
m→+∞||Utmψ −ψ|| = 0 .
As ψ ∈H and the {tm}m∈N are arbitrary, for any ψ ∈H we have:
lim
t→0 ||Utψ −ψ|| = 0 ,
ending the proof.
□
The theory developed thus far puts us in the position to prove an important result due
to von Neumann, which shows how the strong continuity of one-parameter unitary
groups is, actually, not such restrictive a fact in separable Hilbert spaces.
Theorem 9.29 (Von Neumann) Let {Ut}t∈R be a one-parameter unitary group on
the Hilbert space (H, (·|·)). If H is separable, {Ut}t∈R is strongly continuous if and
only if the map R ∋t 
→(Utψ|φ) is Borel measurable for any ψ, φ ∈H.
Proof Obviously if the group is strongly continuous then any R ∋t 
→(Utψ|φ)
is Borel measurable, being continuous. We show the converse. Suppose every such
map is Borel measurable, hence Lebesgue measurable. Schwarz’s inequality and
||Ut|| = 1 imply that these maps are bounded. Given a ∈R, ψ ∈H,
H ∋φ 
→
 a
0
(Utψ|φ)dt
is a bounded linear functional with norm not exceeding |a| ||ψ|| by Schwarz and
||Ut|| = 1. Riesz’s Theorem3.16 provides ψa ∈H such that
(ψa|φ) =
 a
0
(Utψ|φ)dt ,
for any φ ∈H.

520

So
(Ubψa|φ) = (ψa|U−bφ) =
 a

(Utψ|U−bφ)dt =
 a

(Ut+bψ|φ)dt =
 a+b

|(Ubψa|φ) −(ψa|φ)| =

 +

 a+b
a
(Utψ|φ)dt
 ≤2b||φ|| ||ψ||.
Then (Ubψa|φ) →(ψa|φ), as b →0, and so by conjugation:
lim
t→0(φ | Ubψa) →(φ | ψa) .
We are done if we can prove that the set {ψa | ψ ∈H, a ∈R} ﬁnitely generates
a dense space in H, by the previous proposition and choosing φ = ψa. Take φ ∈
{ψa | ψ ∈H, a ∈R}⊥and let {ψ(n)}n∈N be a countable Hilbert basis for H, which
we have by separability (the ﬁnite-dimensional case is the same). For any n ∈N:
0 = (ψ(n)
a |φ) =
 a
0
(Utψ(n)|φ)dt ,
a ∈R ,
implying (Theorem1.76(b)) R ∋t 
→(Utψ(n)|φ) is null almost everywhere. Call
Sn ⊂R the set where the map does not vanish, and ﬁx t0 ∈R \ "
n∈N Sn. The
latter exists for "
n∈N Sn cannot coincide R: the former, in fact, has zero measure as
countable union of zero-measure sets. (This is the point where we need the basis to be
countable, i.e. separability.) Then (Ut0ψ(n)|φ) = 0 for any n, forcing φ = 0 because
Ut0 is unitary and {Ut0ψ(n)}n∈N is a basis. Since {ψa | ψ ∈H, a ∈R}⊥= {0}, the
span of {ψa | ψ ∈H, a ∈R} is dense, as required, and the theorem is proved.
□
Remark 9.30 In the statement we may substitute Borel measurability with measura-
bility for the Lebesgue σ-algebra. If Lebesgue measurability holds, in fact, the proof
does not change and so the group is strongly continuous. Under strong continuity
Borel measurability is granted, so also Lebesgue measurability.

One-Parameter Unitary Groups Generated by
Self-adjoint Operators and Stone’s Theorem
This section contains the celebrated Stone’s theorem, that describes strongly continu-
ous one-parameter unitary groups obtained by exponentiating self-adjoint operators.

9.3 Strongly Continuous One-Parameter Unitary Groups
521
Later we will use these groups to provide a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for the
spectral measures of self-adjoint operators to commute.
Before all this we need a technical result, which we state separately given its
usefulness in many contexts. As usual, dx is the Lebesgue measure on Rn and χ[a,b]

Proposition 9.31 Let H be a complex Hilbert space and {Vt}t∈Rn ⊂B(H) a family
of operators satisfying the two following conditions:
(i) s-limt→t0 Vt = Vt0, for any t0 ∈Rn,
(ii) there exists C ≥0 such that ||Vt|| ≤C for any t ∈Rn.
Then for any f
∈L1(Rn, dx) there is a unique operator on B(H), denoted

φ, ψ ∈H.
(9.83)
If f ∈L1(Rn, dx) has compact (essential) support, condition (i) is enough to guar-
antee the existence of

Rn f (t)Vtdt.
The latter satisﬁes:

integral
I (φ, ψ) :=

It is well deﬁned as Rn ∋t 
→(φ|Vtψ) is continuous, since {Vt}t∈Rn is weakly
continuous, and bounded by (ii) from Schwarz’s inequality. Hence
|I (φ, ψ)| ≤|| f ||1C||ψ||||φ|| .
Since H ∋ψ 
→I (φ, ψ) is linear and we have the above inequality, Riesz’s theorem
gives, for any φ ∈H, a unique Φφ ∈H such that
I (φ, ψ) = (Φφ|ψ) ,
for any ψ ∈H.
The map H ∋φ 
→T φ := Φφ is linear, and by construction
|(ψ|T φ)| = |(T φ|ψ)| = |(Φφ|ψ)| = |I (φ, ψ)| ≤|| f ||1C||ψ||||φ|| ,
with φ, ψ ∈H.
Choosing ψ = T φ shows that T , and hence its adjoint

Rn f (t)Vt dt, are bounded.
By construction (9.83) holds, and the argument ensures uniqueness. From (9.83)
follows

and taking φ =

Rn f (t)Vt dtψ leads to (9.84). Identity (9.85) follows from (9.83).
In case the essential support of f is in a compact set K we can equivalently deﬁne
I (ψ, φ) by integrating on it and then proceeding as before. In such a case the constant
C of (ii) (t ∈K) automatically exists. By continuity, in fact, whichever ψ ∈H we
take there is Cψ ≥0 such that ||Vtψ|| ≤Cψ if t ∈K. By Banach–Steinhaus this
implies that C ≥0 exists with ||Vt|| ≤C if t ∈K. So let us prove (c). Choose [a, b]
so that [a, b] × [a, b] contains an open neighbourhood of (t, s), to which (t′, s′)
belongs. From (a) we have

It is time to pass to Stone’s theorem. This name actually refers to assertion (b), the
only non-elementary statement.
Theorem 9.33 (Stone) Let H be a Hilbert space.
(a) If A : D(A) →H, with D(A) dense in H, is a self-adjoint operator and P(A) is
its spectral measure, then the operators
Ut = eit A :=

σ(A)
eiλt d P(A)(λ) ,
t ∈R ,
form a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group. Moreover:
(i) the limit



exists in H if and only if ψ ∈D(A);
(ii) if ψ ∈D(A):


t=0
ψ = i Aψ .
(9.88)
(b) If {Ut}t∈R is a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group on H, there exists
a unique self-adjoint operator A : D(A) →H (with D(A) dense in H) such that
eit A = Ut ,
for any t ∈R.
(9.89)
Proof (a) If t ∈R, R ∋λ 
→eitλ is trivially bounded, so eit A ∈B(H) by Corol-
lary9.5. Theorem9.4(c) implies (t ∈R) eit A(eit A)∗= (eit A)∗eit A = I, making eit A

unitary. To prove strong continuity it is enough to check (ψ|Utψ) →(ψ|ψ) for any
ψ ∈H as t →0, by Proposition9.27. This is true, by Theorem9.4(f) and since the
domain of eit A is all of H, because:
(ψ|Utψ) =

σ(A)
eitλdμψ(λ) →

σ(A)
1dμψ(λ) = (ψ|ψ) as t →0 .
We used that eitλ →1 and so Lebesgue’s dominated convergence applies, as |eitλ| =
1 for any t and the constant 1 is integrable as μψ is ﬁnite.
Let us prove (i)–(ii). If ψ ∈D(A), from Theorem9.4(c) we compute

The map R ∋λ


Ut −I

ψ −i Aψ

 →0 as t →0, for any ψ ∈D(A).
To ﬁnish we show that Utψ−ψ
t
→φψ ∈H, t →0, implies ψ ∈D(A). The set of
ψ ∈H for which the limit exists is a subspace D(B) in H containing D(A), and
as such is dense. The mapping ψ 
→i Bψ := φψ deﬁnes an operator with dense
domain D(B). If ψ, ψ′ ∈D(B), using U ∗
t = U−t:

Hence B is a symmetric extension of A. But A is self-adjoint, so B = A by Propo-
sition5.17(c). Thus any vector ψ for which the limit of Utψ−ψ
t
exists as t →0 lives
in D(A). This concludes part (a).

9.3 Strongly Continuous One-Parameter Unitary Groups
525
(b) The uniqueness of A is immediate. If there were two self-adjoint operators A,
A′ with eit A = Ut = eit A′ for any t ∈R, (i)–(ii) in (a) would force A = A′. Let
us manufacture a self-adjoint operator A satisfying Ut = eit A for a given strongly
continuous one-parameter unitary group. Specialise Proposition9.31 to a strongly
continuous one-parameter unitary group Vt = Ut. Call D the space of vectors of the
form

R f (t)Ut dtφ, φ ∈H, with arbitrary f ∈D(R) (smooth complex functions
on R with compact support). This vector space D is called Gårding space. Equation
(9.83) easily implies its invariance: UsD ⊂D for any s ∈R, i.e.

For any t ∈R, the function s 
→ht(s) has support contained in a compact set and
is C∞(hence bounded). As (r, s) 
→(φ|Ur−sφ) is also bounded, we may interpret
the integral using the product Lebesgue measure:

(9.92)
Now: the integrand is pointwise inﬁnitesimal as t →0, the maps
(s,r) 
→ht(s)ht(r) (φ|Ur−sφ)
all have support in one large-enough compact set if t varies in a bounded interval
around 0, and they are, there, uniformly bounded by some constant not depending
on t (as (t, s,r) 
→ht(s)ht(r) (φ|Ur−sφ) is jointly continuous in its variables).
Because of all this, we apply dominated convergence and obtain that both sides in
(9.92) vanish as t →0. Therefore, for ψ ∈D we have proven Utψ−ψ

as t →0. The map ψ 
→iSψ := ψ0 is clearly linear. Continuing as in part (a) one
can see S is Hermitian. As a matter of fact S is symmetric since D is dense, which is
what we prove next. Given φ ∈H consider the sequence of

R fn(t)Ut dtφ, where

we conclude
D ∋

Hence D is dense in H and S is symmetric. Now we prove it is essentially self-adjoint
on D. If ψ± ∈Ran(S ± i I)⊥, then for any χ ∈D (recall UtD ⊂D):

and F±(t) := (ψ±|Utχ)isoftheform F±(0)e±t.Ifwewantitbounded(||Ut|| = 1for
any t ∈R), necessarily F±(0) = 0 and ψ± = 0, in turn implying Ran(S ± i I) = H.
By Theorem5.19 that means S : D →H is essentially self-adjoint. Now let S be the
self-adjoint extension of S. To ﬁnish observe that if Vt := eitS, for any ψ, φ ∈D:

Thus (ψ|(Vt)∗Utφ) = (ψ|Iφ). As D is dense, (Vt)∗Ut = I, i.e. Ut = eitS for any
t ∈R.

Corollary 9.34 If A is self-adjoint on the Hilbert space H and D0 ⊂D(A) is dense
and such that eit AD0 ⊂D0 for any t ∈R, then A ↾D0 is essentially self-adjoint, i.e.
D0 is a core of A.
Proof Take ψ ∈D0 ⊂D(A). Then Utψ = eit Aψ is differentiable and its derivative
is i AUtψ. Going through the ﬁnal part of Stone’s proof and replacing the Gårding
space D with D0 proves the claim.
□
Now comes a related technical, and useful, elementary result.
Proposition 9.35 Let A beself-adjointontheHilbertspaceH,anddeﬁneUt := eit A,
t ∈R. For any measurable f : σ(A) →C:
Ut f (A) = f (A)Ut ,
∀t ∈R,
(9.93)
and, consequently
Ut(D( f (A))) = D( f (A)) ,
∀t ∈R.
(9.94)
Proof On one hand ψ ∈D( f (A)) ⇔

σ(A) | f (λ)|2dμψ(λ) < +∞. On the other,
the measures μψ and μUtψ are the same, since
(Utψ|P(A)(E)Utψ) = (ψ|U ∗
t P(A)(E)Utψ) ,
but U ∗
t P(A)(E)Ut = P(A)(E) from (9.14)–(9.15) in Theorem9.4(c) (recall all inte-
grals refer to bounded maps so the operators are deﬁned on the entire space). In
conclusion ψ ∈D( f (A)) ⇔Utψ ∈D( f (A)). Conversely, f (A)ψ ∈D(Ut) = H
holds trivially, since Ut is unitary. With this, using (9.14)–(9.15) in Theorem9.4(c),
we get Ut f (A)ψ = f (A)Utψ for any ψ ∈D( f (A)), i.e. (9.93). Summing up, we
haveprovedthatUt f (A) ⊂f (A)Ut.ApplyingU−t tobothsides(seeRemark5.4) we
alsohave f (A)U−t ⊂U−t f (A).Sincet ∈Risarbitrary,wecanrecastthisidentityas
f (A)Ut ⊂Ut f (A). Since Ut f (A) ⊂f (A)Ut we ﬁnally obtain Ut f (A) = f (A)Ut.
Remark5.4(v) eventually proves Ut(D( f (A))) = D( f (A)).
□
The next deﬁnition will be fundamental for physical applications, as we will see in
Chaps.12 and 13.
Deﬁnition 9.36 (Self-adjoint generator) Let H be a Hilbert space, {Ut}t∈R ⊂B(H)
a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group. The unique self-adjoint operator
A on H fulﬁlling (9.89) is called (self-adjoint) generator of {Ut}t∈R ⊂B(H).
The self-adjoint generator A is typically unbounded. It is bounded – and so deﬁned
on all H – precisely when {Ut}t∈R is continuous at t = 0 (and hence everywhere) in
the uniform topology. See Exercise9.7.
Stone’s theorem has a host of useful corollaries, and here is one.
Corollary 9.37 If A : D(A) →H has dense domain in the Hilbert space H and is
self-adjoint (in general unbounded), and U : H →H1 is an isomorphism (surjective
isometry), then

528
9
Spectral Theory II: Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
Ueis AU −1 = eisU AU −1 ,
s ∈R .
The same holds, in particular, when H = H1 and U is unitary.
Proof The operator U AU −1 is clearly self-adjoint on U D(A) by deﬁnition. Hence
the strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group {eisU AU −1}s∈R is well deﬁned.
As U is an isomorphism, {Ueis AU −1}s∈R too is a strongly continuous one-parameter
unitary group on H1. Furthermore, if ψ = U −1φ ∈U −1D(A) then
lim
s→0
Ueis AU−1ψ −ψ

By Stone’s theorem the generator of {Ueis AU −1}s∈R is a self-adjoint extension of
U AU −1; but the latter is already self-adjoint, so the generator of {Ueis AU −1}s∈R is
U AU −1 itself, and
Ueis AU −1 = eisU AU −1 ,
s ∈R .
□
Remarks 9.38
(1) In a sense Stone’s theorem is a special case in the larger picture created by the
Hille–Yosida theorem [Rud91]. This has had a momentous impact in mathematical
physics, esp. concerning the applications of the theory of semigroups. Let us remind
that, in a Banach space (X, || ||), a strongly continuous semigroup of operators
{Qt}t∈[0,+∞) is a collection of operators Qt ∈B(X) such that: (a) Q(0) = I, (b)
Qt+s = Qt Qs for s, t ∈[0, +∞), and (c) ||Qtψ −ψ|| →0 as t →0 for any
ψ ∈X. A generator is an operator A on X such that
d
dt Qtψ = −AQtψ = −Qt Aψ ,
ψ ∈D(A).
This condition determines A completely. The derivative is computed in the norm of
X.
If we look at the subcase of normal (bounded) operators {Qt}t∈[0,+∞) on a Hilbert
space X = H, then [Rud91]: (1) every semigroup has a densely deﬁned generator A,
(2) A is normal (unbounded, in general), and (3)
Qt = e−t A ,
where the right-hand side is deﬁned by the integral of
σ(A) ∋λ 
→e−tλ
inthePVMofthespectraldecompositionof A (extendingTheorem9.13tounbounded
normal operators [Rud91]). At last: (4) the real part of the spectrum of A is lower
bounded, i.e. there exists γ ∈R such that γ < Re(λ) for any λ ∈σ(A).

9.3 Strongly Continuous One-Parameter Unitary Groups
529
The following fundamental general result is however valid in Banach spaces
[Rud91].
Theorem 9.39 (Hille–Yosida) Let A be a closed linear operator deﬁned on a linear
subspace D(A) of a Banach space X, and ﬁx r, M ∈R with M > 0.
Then A is the generator of a strongly-continuous semigroup {Qt}t∈[0,+∞) ⊂B(X)
that satisﬁes
||Qt|| ≤Mert
t ∈[0, +∞)
if and only if D(A) is dense in X, every λ > r belongs to ρ(A) and for such λ and
every positive n ∈N the bound
||(A −λI)−n|| ≤
M
(λ −r)n
holds.
(2) A useful and important result in operator theory is the Trotter formula, which has
a big impact in the rigorous theory of path integrals [AH-KM08]. We present the
statement in the unitary case [Che74].
Theorem 9.40 Let A, B be self-adjoint operators on the Hilbert space H and sup-
pose that A + B, deﬁned on D(A) ∩D(B), is essentially self-adjoint. Then the
corresponding strongly continuous unitary groups satisfy the Trotter formula

9.3.3
Commuting Operators and Spectral Measures
To ﬁnish the chapter we prove a bunch of technical results about commuting spectral
measures of self-adjoint operators, which rely on the one-parameter groups they gen-
erate. For bounded self-adjoint operators the spectral measures commute if and only
if the operators themselves commute, an easy consequence of the spectral theorem
(see also Corollary9.42). For unbounded operators, instead, there are domain-related
issues and the criterion cannot be used. Using unitary groups is a simple way to over-
come this problem. The next result is widely applied in QM.
Theorem 9.41 Let A, B be (in general unbounded) operators on the Hilbert space
H, with A further self-adjoint.
(i) Suppose B is self-adjoint and call P(A), P(B) the respective spectral measures.
Then the following statements are equivalent.
(a) For any Borel sets E, E′ ⊂R:
P(A)(E)P(B)(E′) = P(B)(E′)P(A)(E) .

530

Spectral Theory II: Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
(b) For any Borel set E ⊂R and any s ∈R:
P(A)(E)eisB = eisB P(A)(E) .
(c) For any t, s ∈R:
eit AeisB = eisBeit A .
(d) For any t ∈R:
eit AB ⊂Beit A ,
(d)’ For any t ∈R:
eit AB = Beit A ,
If these conditions hold, then
eit A(D(B)) = D(B) for all t ∈R.
(ii) Under either of the above ﬁve conditions:
ABψ = B Aψ
if ψ ∈D(AB) ∩D(B A)
(Aϕ|Bψ) −(Bϕ|Aψ) = 0
if ψ, ϕ ∈D(A) ∩D(B).
(iii) If B ∈B(H) (not necessarily self-adjoint) and P(A) is the PVM of A, the
following are equivalent.
(e) B A ⊂AB.
(f) B f (A) ⊂f (A)B for any measurable f : σ(A) →R.
(g) B P(A)(E) = P(A)(E)B for any Borel set E ⊂R.
(h) Beit A = eit AB for every t ∈R.
Proof (i) First of all we notice that (d)’ is equivalent to (d): the former implies
the latter, and the latter entails, applying e−it A, Be−it A ⊂e−it AB. Since t ∈R
is arbitrary, we have Beit A ⊂eit AB which, in turn, implies (d)’. (d’) immediately
implies the last statement of (i).
Let us pass to the remaining part of (i). Using Deﬁnition9.14 the identity in (b)

where the standard deﬁnition of integral of a bounded measurable map in a spectral
measure was employed, by Theorem9.4(a). That (a) implies (c) is immediate by
deﬁnition of integral of a bounded map in a spectral measure (Chap.8) working in
the strong topology. Let us prove (c) ⇒(b) ⇒(a). For the ﬁrst implication, from
(9.96), given Us := eisB, ψ, φ ∈H and s ∈R, we have

where we introduced complex measures as in Theorem8.52(c). The above integrals
can be transformed in integrals for ﬁnite positive measures by Theorem1.87. Next,
using Fubini–Tonelli in (9.97) we can say that if f is (up to the sign of t) the Fourier
transform of a map in the Schwartz space S(R) (see Chap.3):

satisﬁes gn ∈D(R) and converges uniformly to h as n →+∞. As gn ∈D(R) ⊂

As ψ, φ are arbitrary, obvious manipulations give (b):
P(A)(E)eisB = eisB P(A)(E) for any Borel set E ⊂R, any s ∈R.
(9.101)
Now we can prove (b) ⇒(a). Iterating the procedure that leads to (b) knowing (c),
where now eisB replaces eit A and the unitary Us is replaced by the projector P(A)(E),
we obtain that (9.101) implies (a): P(A)

To ﬁnish (i) there remains to show that (d) is equivalent to one of the preceding
statements. If (c) holds, by Stone’s theorem and the continuity of eit A, (d) follows
immediately. On the other hand (d) ⇒(c), let us see why. First of all (d) amounts

532

Spectral Theory II: Unbounded Operators on Hilbert Spaces
to eit ABe−it A = B, so exponentiating gives eis(eit A Be−it A) = eisB. For any given
s ∈R the strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups t 
→eis(eit A Be−it A) and
t 
→eit AeisBe−it A have the same generator, so they coincide by Stone’s theorem.
Hence eit AeisBe−it A = eisB, i.e. (c).
Let us prove (ii). For the ﬁrst assertion, take ψ ∈D(AB) ∩D(B A) and look at
(c) in (i): eit AeisBψ = eisBeit Aψ. Differentiating in t at the origin, Stone’s theorem
gives AeisBψ = eisB Aψ. Now we differentiate in s at the origin. The right side
gives i B Aψ by Stone. On the left we can move the derivative past A, as A = A∗
is closed and because the limit exists. Hence i ABψ = i B Aψ, as we wanted. Now
we prove the second assertion, assuming again (c). If ψ ∈D(A) and ϕ ∈D(B),
(eit Aψ|eisBϕ) = (e−isBψ|e−it Aϕ). Differentiating in t and s at t = s = 0 proves the
claim by Stone’s theorem.
Assertion (iii) goes like this. It is obvious that (f) implies (e) and (g) (choose
f = χE for (g)). So we show (e) ⇒(h) ⇒(f). First we prove that (e) forces B to
commute with eit A for any t ∈R, that is, (h). For this we shall use Proposition9.25(d,
f). Let ψ be analytic for A and for every power in the dense set of Proposition9.25(f).
As B is bounded, using Proposition9.25(d):
Beit Aψ =
+∞

n=0
(it)n
n! B Anψ =
+∞

n=0
(it)n
n! An Bψ = e−it ABψ .
In the last two equalities we used B Aψ = ABψ repeatedly, plus ||An Bψ|| =
||B Anψ|| ≤||B||||Anψ||, so Bψ is analytic for A. But ψ moves in a dense set
and the operators B, eit A are continuous, so Beit A = eit AB. If B is bounded and
commutes with every eit A, B commutes with the spectral measure of A, and this
incidentally proves that (h) ⇒(g). The proof is similar to the proof that, in (i), (c)
implies (b): we just have to replace Us by B. Hence by deﬁnition of g(A), if g is
bounded (and so is g(A)) then Bg(A) = g(A)B. At this point notice
μ(A)
Bψ(E) = (Bψ|P(A)(E)Bψ) = (P(A)Bψ|P(A)(E)Bψ)
= (B P(A)ψ|B P(A)(E)ψ) ≤||B||2μ(A)
ψ (E)
(9.102)
so ψ ∈D( f (A)) implies Bψ ∈D( f (A)). Applying the deﬁnition of f (A) for
f measurable unbounded, and taking a sequence of bounded measurable maps fn
converging to f in L2(σ(A), μψ), we obtain (f), by taking the limit as n →+∞
of B fn(A)ψ = fn(A)Bψ, for any n ∈N, since B is continuous (the equality holds
for fn is bounded). At last, (g) implies (9.102), and (e) follows from the previous
argument with f (x) = x.

if and only if their spectral measures commute.
Proof If the operators commute, (g) holds in (iii) above. Apply (iii) giving B the role
of A and P(A)(E) the role of B. Then P(B)(F)P(A)(E) = P(A)(E)P(B)(F) for any
Borel sets E, F ⊂R. Conversely, if the spectral measures commute, by deﬁnition
of integral of a bounded PVM it follows that B P(A)(E) = P(A)(E)B for any Borel
set E ⊂R. Now (iii) implies ABψ = B Aψ for any ψ ∈D(A), which is another
way to write B A ⊂AB.
□
Here is another useful technical consequence.
Corollary 9.43 Let A be self-adjoint on the Hilbert space H and B0 : D(B0) →H
essentially self-adjoint. If
eit AB0 ⊂B0eit A ,
∀t ∈R ,
then A and B := B0 satisfy (a), (b), (c), (d) in Theorem9.41(i).
Proof It sufﬁces to note that by deﬁnition of closure, using the continuity of eit A,
the self-adjoint operator B : D(B) →H satisﬁes
eit AD(B) ⊂D(B) ,
eit ABφ = Beit Aφ ,
∀t ∈R , ∀φ ∈D(B) .
Then part (i) in Theorem9.41 produces the claim.

Hint. The second condition amounts to saying λ does not belong to σp(T ), so
(T −λI)−1 : Ran(T −λI) →D(T ) exists. Then λ ∈σ(T ) = σp(T ) ∪σc(T ). Can
(T −λI)−1 be bounded?
9.4 Consider the space L2(X, μ) with μ positive and ﬁnite on the Borel σ-algebra
of a space X. Let f : X →R be an arbitrary real, measurable, and locally L2 map
(i.e. f · g ∈L2(X, μ) for any g ∈Cc(X)). Consider the operator on L2(X, μ):
T f : h 
→f · h
where D(T f ) := {h ∈L2(X, μ)| f ·h ∈L2(X, μ)}. Prove T f is self-adjoint. Without
using Proposition9.17 explicitly, show
σ(T f ) = ess ran( f ) .
For f : X →R, ess ran( f ) is the essential rank of the measurable map f , deﬁned
by R ∋v ∈ran ess( f ) ⇔μ

f −1(v −ε, v + ε)

> 0 for any ε > 0.
Hint. The domain of T f is dense because f is locally L2, and the self-adjointness
comes from computing T ∗
f = T f . The second part goes along these lines. Observe
that λ ∈ρ(T f ) ⇔the resolvent Rλ(T f ) exists on L2(X, μ) and is bounded, i.e.
there is M > 0 such that ||Rλ(T f )h|| ≤M for any unit map h ∈L2(X, μ). That is
to say, λ ∈ρ(T f ) if and only if:

X
|h(x)|2
| f (x) −λ|2 dμ(x) < M
for any unit h ∈L2(X, μ) .
If λ /∈ess ran( f ), by deﬁnition of essential rank and μ(X) < +∞we see that
the condition holds, so λ /∈ess ran( f ) ⇒λ /∈σ(T f ). If λ ∈ess ran( f ), still
by deﬁnition of essential rank we may build a sequence of unit vectors hn such
that

X
|h(x)|2
| f (x)−λ|2 dμ(x) > 1/n2 for any n = 1, 2, . . .. Hence λ ∈ess ran( f ) ⇒
λ ∈σ(T f ).
9.5 Consider a PVM P : B(C) →H with H separable. Prove A ∈B(H) has the
form A =

C f d P for some f ∈Mb(C) if and only if it commutes with every
B ∈B(H) satisfying B P(E) = P(E)B for any E ∈B(C).
Solution. The sufﬁcient implication is known, so we just prove the necessary part
of the equivalence. Divide supp(P) in a disjoint collection, at most countable, of
bounded sets En, and H in the corresponding orthogonal sum H = ⊕nHn, Hn :=
P(En)(H). Every Hn is A-invariant, since AP(En) = P(En)A by assumption. If
An := A ↾Hn: Hn →Hn, then Aψ = 
n Anψ for any ψ ∈H. Moreover (see
Corollary9.42) An commutes with any operator in B(Hn) that commutes with the
bounded normal operator Tn :=

Then fn →f (the fn are null outside En) in L2(C, μψ) by dominated convergence
if ψ ∈Δ f . Therefore Aψ =

9.6 Let H be separable and T : D(T ) →H self-adjoint on H (not necessarily
bounded). Prove that A ∈B(H) has the form A = f (T ), for some f : R →C
measurable and bounded, if and only if A commutes with every B ∈B(H) such that
BT ψ = T Bψ for any ψ ∈D(T ).
Solution. If P(T ) is the PVM of T , B P(T )(E) = P(T )(E)B ⇔BT ψ = T Bψ
for any ψ ∈D(T ). The claim boils down to proving A =

f d P(T ), f bounded, iff
A commutes with any B ∈B(H) commuting with P(T ). Exercise9.5 does exactly
that.
9.7 If A is the self-adjoint generator of a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary
group Ut = eit A, prove that A is bounded (and hence it is deﬁned on the whole
Hilbert space) if and only if ||Ut −I|| →0, as t →0.
Hint. Passing to the spectral representation of A, we have ||Ut −I|| = || ft||∞
where ft(λ) = |eitλ −1|. Since (a, b) ∋λ 
→ft(λ) tends to 0 uniformly in λ, as
t →0, if and only if a, b are ﬁnite, the claim follows.
9.8 Consider the operators A, A⋆of Sect.9.1.4. Prove they are closable, and
σp(A) = C
so that σ(A) = C while σc(A) = σr(A) = ∅.
Outline of solution. The operators are closable because they admit closed exten-
sions, for A ⊂(A⋆)∗and A⋆⊂A∗. Using the Hilbert basis {ψn}n∈N of Sect.9.1.4,
construct explicitly an eigenvector ψ ∈H \ {0} of A (i.e. Aψ = λψ) for every
λ ∈C \ {0}. Supposing ψ = 
n∈N cnψn we may heuristically assume that
Aψ = λ 
n∈N cn
√nψn−1, so that
cn+1 =
cn
λ√n + 1 .
and thus the candidate eigenvector reads
ψ =

n∈N
c0λ−n
√(n + 1)!ψn .
It is easy to prove that, for c0 ̸= 0, the series converges to a non-zero element of H
which belongs to D(A) and satisﬁes Aψ = λψ. We already know that ψ0 satisﬁes
Aψ0 = Aψ0 = 0, so 0 ∈σp(A).

the deﬁnition of adjoint, prove that D(A) and A have the form claimed. Finally,
again exploiting the deﬁnition of adjoint, demonstrate that (A⋆)∗= A and conclude

Particles are solutions to differential equations.
Werner Karl Heisenberg
In this chapter we examine applications of the theory of unbounded operators in
Hilbert spaces, where spectral theory, as developed in Chaps.8 and 9, plays a para-
mount technical role during the proofs. The ﬁnal part of the chapter presents a series
of classical results about certain operators of interest in Quantum Mechanics, in par-
ticular regarding self-adjointness and spectral lower bounds. We recommend [Tes09]
for a quite complete, recent treatise on spectral theory applied to QM and Schrödinger
operators, in addition to the classical book [ReSi80].
Section one is devoted to the study of abstract differential equations in Hilbert
spaces.
The second section pertains the notion of Hilbert tensor product of Hilbert spaces
and of operators (typically unbounded), plus their spectral properties. We apply this
to one example, the orbital angular momentum of a quantum particle.
Weextendthepolardecompositiontheoremtoclosed,densely-deﬁnedunbounded
operators in the third section. The properties of operators of the form A∗A, with A
densely deﬁned and closed, are examined, together with square roots of unbounded
positive self-adjoint operators.
Section four contains the statement, the proof and a few direct applications of the
Kato–Rellich theorem, which gives criteria for a self-adjoint operator, perturbed by
a symmetric operator, to remain self-adjoint, and establishes lower bounds for the
perturbed spectrum.

Spectral Theory III: Applications
10.1
Abstract Differential Equations in Hilbert Spaces
Looking at spectral theory from the right angle allows to tackle the issue of existence
and uniqueness of solutions to certain PDEs that are important in physics. Recall
[Sal08] that a second-order linear differential equation in u ∈C2(Ω; R), for given
open set Ω ⊂Rn and continuous real maps ai j, bi, c, has the form:
n

i, j=1
ai j(x) ∂2u
∂xi∂x j
+
n

i=1
bi(x) ∂u
∂xi
+ c(x)u = 0 .
Equations of this kin are classiﬁed, pointwise at each x ∈Ω, into (a) elliptic, (b)
parabolic or (c) hyperbolic type according to the spectrum of the symmetric matrix
ai j(x). He have type (a) when the eigenvalues have the same sign ±, (b) when there
is a null eigenvalue, (c) when there are eigenvalues with opposite sign but none
vanishes. An equation is called elliptic, parabolic or hyperbolic if it is such at each
point x ∈Ω.
By a smart coordinate choice around each point in Ω, the equation can be written
as:
a(t, y) ∂2
∂t2 u(t, y) +
n−1

i, j=1
a′
i j(t, y) ∂2u
∂yi∂y j
+ b(t, y)∂u
∂t
+
n−1

i=1
b′
i(t, y) ∂u
∂yi
+ c(t, y)u(t, y) = 0 .
For elliptic equations (e.g. Poisson’s equation) a(t, y) is never zero and has the same
sign of the eigenvalues (all non-zero) of the symmetric matrix a′
i j(t, y). Parabolic
equations (e.g. the heat equation where b(t, y) ̸= 0) have a(t, y) = 0. For hyperbolic
equations (e.g. d’Alembert’s equation) a(t, y) has opposite sign to some eigenvalues
(none zero) of the symmetric matrix a′
i j(t, y).
We shall suppose all functions we consider are complex-valued, and study the
theory of these PDEs from a different point of view. The above will be considered
“abstract differential equations” in Hilbert spaces equipped with suitable topologies.
The variable t will be regarded as a parameter upon which the solutions depends:
this will give a curve in the Hilbert space. The differential operators determined by
the matrix a′
i j and the vector b′
i will become operators acting on a subspace in the
Hilbert space L2(Ω, dy) containing the support of the solution curve. One can even
use a completely abstract Hilbert space H, without mentioning coordinates, whence
solutions become H-valued functions t →ut ∈H. This generalisation will allow
us to treat equations that do not beﬁt the classical trichotomy (like the Schrödinger
equation), equations of degree higher than the second, and equations that cannot be
classiﬁed within the above scheme, like those where the differential operator given
by the matrix a′
i j is formally replaced by a square root. For instance

or not) and k = 0, 1, 2, . . . is ﬁxed, we let

exists and is continuous for j = 0, 1 . . . , k

where derivative and continuity refer to the topology of H.
We shall also write C(J; S) := C0(J; S).
Remark 10.2
(1) Of course C(J; S) is a complex vector space.
(2) It is easy to prove, by inner product/norm continuity and Schwarz’s inequality,
that:

for every t ∈J, when u, v : J →H are differentiable everywhere on J (in

(3) If H = L2(Ω, dx), with Ω ⊂Rn open, and we take a family of maps ut ∈
L 2(Ω, dx), (t, x) ∈J ×Ω for a given open interval J ⊂R, the existence of the
derivative at t forces the existence in L2(Ω, dx), under rather weak hypotheses.
For example
Proposition 10.3 Let Ω ⊂Rn be bounded and open, J ⊂R an open interval and
{ut}t∈J ⊂L 2(Ω, dx) a family deﬁned on Ω.
If the maps u = ut(x) are differentiable in t for every x ∈Ω and | ∂ut
∂t | ≤M
in Ω for some M ∈R and any t ∈J, then (viewing {ut}t∈J ⊂L2(Ω, dx) for the
derivative):
∃dut
dt
for every t ∈J and
dut
dt = ∂ut
∂t
a.e. at x for any t ∈J,
where the derivative is computed as usual.
(This generalises to higher derivatives in the obvious way.)
Proof Note Ω ∋x →
∂ut
∂t is measurable for any t ∈J as pointwise limit of
measurable functions. For any given t ∈J, the mean value theorem says that for

The right integrand is smaller, uniformly with respect to h, than the constant M
in L2(Ω, dx), since Ω has ﬁnite Lebesgue measure. As the integrand is pointwise
inﬁnitesimal when h →0, dominated convergence proves the claim.

Having Ω bounded can be dropped in favour of a uniform estimate in t, of the sort

10.1.1
The Abstract Schrödinger Equation (With Source)
The ﬁrst equation we study is Schrödinger’s equation, for which we allow a source
term to be present. The equation will be considered abstractly, in a Hilbert space, and
without referring to physics. We shall return to it in chapter 13, when the physical
meaning of the sourceless case will be discussed. For the standard theory of PDEs
the Schrödinger equation has the following structure (numerical coefﬁcients apart,
whose great relevance is neglected for the time being):
−i ∂
∂t ut(x) + (A0ut)(x) = S(t, x)
(10.2)
where J ⊂R is a ﬁxed open interval, Ω ⊂Rn a given open set,
A0 := −Δx + V (x) : D(A0) →L2(Ω, dx)
(10.3)
is deﬁned on some domain D(A0) ⊂C2(Ω), V : Ω →R and S : J × Ω →C are
given maps, say continuous, and ﬁnally Δx is the usual Laplacian on Rn.
A function u = u(t, x) is called classical solution to (10.2) if it is deﬁned for
(t, x) ∈J ×Ω, of class C1 in t and C2 in x1, . . . , xn, and of course if it solves (10.2)
on its domain.
If the functions in D(A0) decay quickly outside compact sets in Ω and the ﬁrst
derivatives are bounded, the operator A0 is certainly Hermitian, as is clear by inte-
grating by parts. At least for Ω := Rn, we expect that choosing D(A0) properly will
make A0 essentially self-adjoint in L2(Ω, dx). We already know that for Ω := Rn
and V := 0, the operator A0 of (10.3) is essentially self-adjoint on the domain
D(A0) := S (Rn) (Exercises 5.13 and 5.14); as we shall see, the same holds on
D(A0) := D(Rn). We will discuss more general cases, with V ̸= 0, in Sect.10.4.
Assuming A := A0 is self-adjoint leads to a different interpretation of Eq.(10.2),
where A0 is replaced by any self-adjoint operator and differentiation in t is deﬁned
with reference to the topology of the Hilbert space.
Let us ﬁx an open interval J ⊂R, J ∋0. If A : D(A) →H is a self-adjoint
operator on the Hilbert space H and J ∋t →St ∈H a given map in C(J; H), the
abstract Schrödinger equation with source is:
−i d
dt ut + Aut = St
(10.4)

10.1 Abstract Differential Equations in Hilbert Spaces
543
where u ∈C1(J; D(A)) is the unknown. As we said, the derivative is computed
in the topology of H. The source is the function S = St. If St = 0 for any t ∈J,
Eq.(10.4) is as usual called homogeneous.
The Cauchy problem for the Schrödinger equation, whether with source or
homogeneous, is the problem of ﬁnding a function u ∈C1(J; H) solving (10.4),
with or without source, together with the initial condition:
u0 = v ∈D(A).
(10.5)
Remark 10.4 If A0 is of the form (10.3) and essentially self-adjoint, we can consider
a classical solution u = u(t, x) to (10.2), for which u(t, ·) ∈D(A0) for any t ∈J.
Under assumptions of the kind of Proposition 10.3, u also solves the abstract equation
(10.4), as D(A) = D(A0) ⊃D(A0). Therefore classical solutions are abstract
solutions, under mild assumptions.
■
The ﬁrst result establishes the uniqueness of the solution to the abstract Schrödinger
equation with any initial condition.
Proposition 10.5 If u = ut solves the homogeneous equation (10.4):
||ut|| = ||u0|| for any t ∈J.
(10.6)
Hence if a solution to the Cauchy problem (10.4)–(10.5) exists, with St ̸= 0 in
general, it is unique.
Proof From (10.1) and (10.4), for St = 0:
d
dt ||ut||2 = d
dt (ut|ut) = i(Aut|ut) −i(ut|Aut) = 0
because A is self-adjoint. So ||ut|| = ||u0||. Uniqueness follows immediately because
if u, u′ both solve the Cauchy problem (St is the same), then J ∋t →ut −u′
t solves
(10.4) with St = 0 and initial condition u0 = 0, so ut −u′
t = 0 for every t ∈J. □
We are interested in existence now. Actually, we already have everything we need,
because Stone’s theorem (Theorem 9.33) implies existence in the homogeneous case:
Proposition 10.6 A solution to the homogeneous Cauchy problem (10.4)–(10.5) has
the form:
ut = e−it Av ,
t ∈J ,
where the exponential is understood in spectral sense.
Proof Immediate consequence of Theorem 9.33.
□

544
10
Spectral Theory III: Applications
Remark 10.7 If v /∈D(A) we can still deﬁne ut := e−it Av, because the domain of
the unitary operator e−it A is H. The map J ∋t →ut does not solve the homogeneous
Schrödinger equation. But trivially
d
dt (z|ut) + i(Az|ut) = 0 for any z ∈D(A), t ∈J,
(10.7)
by Stone’s theorem, because the inner product is continuous and e−it A is unitary,
implying (z|e−it Av) = (eit Az|v). Due to (10.7) the map J ∋t →ut is called a weak
solution to the homogeneous Schrödinger equation.
■
It should be clear that the solution set to the Schrödinger equation with source (10.4)
– if non-empty – consists of functions
J ∋t →u(0)
t
+ st ,
where: s is an arbitrary, but ﬁxed, solution to the non-homogeneous equation (10.4),
and u(0) is free in the vector space of homogeneous solutions. A solution to the
equation with source satisfying the zero initial condition can be written as:
st = e−ti A
	 t
0
eτi ASτdτ ,
assuming something on S ∈C(J; H). We can prove the next theorem.
Theorem 10.8 Let A : D(A) →H be a self-adjoint operator on the Hilbert space
H, J ⊂R an open interval with 0 ∈J. If:
(i) v ∈D(A),
(ii) J ∋t →St is continuous in the topology of H,
(iii) St ∈D(A) for any t ∈J,
(iv) J ∋t →ASt is continuous in the topology of H,
there exists a unique solution J ∋t →ut ∈C1(J; D(A)) to the Cauchy problem

 dut

u0 = v .

The solution has the form:

t ∈J .
(10.9)
The integral above has to be interpreted as follows. If J ∋t →Lt ∈B(H) is
continuous in the strong topology and J ∋t →ψt ∈H is continuous, the vector
 b
a Lτψτdτ ∈D(A), a, b ∈J, is by deﬁnition the unique element in H satisfying:

Proposition 10.5 grants uniqueness, so we just need existence. We will show the
right side of (10.8) solves the Cauchy problem (10.9). By deﬁnition
 t
0 eτi ASτdτ is
the null vector if t = 0, so the right-hand side of (10.9) satisﬁes u0 = v. We claim
ut ∈D(A). We know eit Av ∈D(A) by Proposition 10.6. In reality ut belongs in

proved that if Sτ ∈D(A):

(10.12)
Summing up we have ut ∈D(A) since eit Av ∈D(A),
 t
0 eτi ASτdτ ∈D(A) and so
e−it A  t
0 eτi ASτdτ ∈D(A) since e−it A(D(A)) ⊂D(A) for one-parameter unitary
groups generated by self-adjoint operators.
Now we show ut is a solution. The ﬁrst term on the right in (10.9) admits derivative
−i Ae−it Av by Stone’s theorem. We want to prove the derivative of the second term

10.1.2
The Abstract Klein–Gordon/d’Alembert Equation
(With Source and Dissipative Term)
The second equation we shall analyse is the Klein–Gordon equation. Once a again
we will assume there is a source term, and now also a dissipative term proportional to
the time derivative by a positive coefﬁcient. We shall not return to it at a later stage,
so the study begins and ends here. Yet it has to be remembered that the equation
has great importance in Quantum Field Theory. Assuming a certain parameter (the
mass, in physics) vanishes and in absence of dissipation, the equation goes under
the name of D’Alembert equation and describes small deformations of (any kind of)
waves in linear media. Under the lens of standard PDE theory, the Klein–Gordon
equation (with dissipative term and source as well) is hyperbolic in nature. Its struc-
ture (ignoring the important physical meaning of the coefﬁcients) is the following:
given an open interval J ⊂R and an open set Ω ⊂Rn the equation reads
∂2
∂t2 ut(x) + 2γ ∂
∂t ut(x) + (A0ut)(x) = S(t, x)
(10.14)

10.1 Abstract Differential Equations in Hilbert Spaces
549
where, on some domain D(A0) ⊂C2(Ω),
A0 = −Δx + m2 : D(A0) →L2(Ω, dx) ,
(10.15)
m > 0, γ ≥0 are constants, V : Ω →R and S : J × Ω →C are given functions,
for instance continuous, and Δx is the Laplace operator on Rn. The D’Alembert
equation arises from setting m = 0, γ = 0 in (10.14)–(10.15). One can consider
equations where m and γ are functions, too.
A map u = u(t, x) is a classical solution to (10.14) if it is deﬁned on (t, x) ∈
J × Ω, it is twice differentiable with continuity in every variable, and it solves the
equation on its domain.
We can make the same comments of the previous section about A0. Supposing
A := A0 is self-adjoint, we can reinterpret Eq.(10.14), where now A0 is replaced by
any self-adjoint operator, here positive deﬁnite, and the t-derivative is in the topology
of the Hilbert space.
Fix an open interval J ⊂R with J ∋0. Let A : D(A) →H be self-adjoint on
the Hilbert space H, J ∋t →St ∈H a given map in C(J; H), γ > 0 a constant.
The abstract Klein–Gordon equation with source and dissipative term reads:
d2
dt2 ut + 2γ d
dt ut + Aut = St
(10.16)
where u ∈C2(J; D(A)) is the unknown function. Derivatives are deﬁned with
respect to H. The source is the function S = St and the dissipative term is the one
multiplied by γ ≥0. If St = 0 for any t ∈J, Eq.(10.16) is homogeneous.
The Cauchy problem for the Klein–Gordon equation with dissipative term,
whether with source or homogeneous, is the problem that seeks a solution u ∈
C2(J; D(A)) to (10.16), respectively with source or homogeneous, subject to the
initial conditions:
u0 = v ∈D(A) ,
dut
dt |t=0 = v′ ∈H .
(10.17)
Remark 10.10
(1) If A0 is of type (10.15) and essentially self-adjoint, we may take a classical
solution u = u(t, x) to (10.14), for which u(t, ·) ∈D(A0) for any t ∈J. Under
assumptions of the kind of Proposition 10.3 for the ﬁrst and second time-derivatives,
the solution also satisﬁes the abstract equation (10.16), as D(A) = D(A0) ⊃D(A0).
Therefore, under not so strong assumptions, classical solutions are solutions in the
abstract sense.
(2) The abstract approach presented allows for operators A different from self-adjoint
extensions of Laplacians. The abstract equation beﬁts important situations in physics,
like waves created by small deformations of elastic media with inner tensions at rest

Spectral Theory III: Applications
(a violin’s sound board): A is a self-adjoint extension of the squared Laplacian
Δ2, which is a fourth-order differential operator. Allowing for dissipative term and
source, the classical equation governing the deformation u = u(t, x) is:
a ∂2u
∂t2 + bΔ2
xu + c∂u
∂t = S(t, x)
for a, b > 0, c ≥0.
■
Our ﬁrst result establishes uniqueness for the abstract Klein–Gordon with any given
initial condition, provided A, apart from being positive, does not have zero as an
eigenvalue. These assumptions are automatic for operators like (10.15), and if one
works on reasonable domains such as D(Rn). Note that closing the operator might
cause 0 to appear as an eigenvalue.
Proposition 10.11 Suppose u = ut solves the homogeneous equation (10.16), with
γ ≥0, and A is self-adjoint, A ≥0 and Ker(A) = {0}. Then the energy estimate

E[ut] :=



2
+ (ut|Aut) .
(10.19)
Hence, if a solution J ∋t →ut to (10.16) exists (St ̸= 0 in general), it is uniquely
determined, for t ∈[0, +∞) ∩J, by u0 and dut/dt|t=0. If γ = 0 the solution is
unique everywhere on J.

Consider now two solutions to Eq.(10.16) with source, and suppose they have the
same initial data. The difference of the solutions, u = ut, solves the homogeneous
equation, hence also (10.18). By construction u0 = 0, dut/dt|t=0 = 0, and the
function on the right in (10.18) is continuous. Therefore, for any t ≥0:
E[ut] ≤E[u0] = 0 ,
where we used u0 = 0 and dut/dt|t=0 = 0. As E[ut] ≥0 by deﬁnition (10.19), we
conclude that
E[ut] = 0 if t ≥0 .
Deﬁnition (10.19) implies (ut|Aut) = 0, so by Theorem (9.4) (
√

√
Aut) = 0,
i.e. ut ∈Ker(
√
A), if t ≥0 (recall D(A) ⊂D(

A ≥0, by deﬁnition of D( f (A))). If we had
√
Aut = 0, then
√

√
Aut = 0 i.e.
Aut = 0, which is impossible unless ut = 0. So ut = 0 when t ≥0, and the two
solutions coincide for t ≥0. If γ = 0 the argument works for t < 0 as well, by
ﬂipping the sign of t to −t.
□
We are interested in having global existence on J. We will establish a result in
the homogeneous case with “small” dissipative term, when σ(A) is bounded from
below by a positive constant and restricting the initial condition v′.
Proposition 10.12 Let γ ≥0 be given, and assume A −γ 2I ≥εI for some ε > 0.
Given initial conditions (10.17) with v ∈D(A), v′ ∈D(
√
A), the homogeneous
Cauchy problem (10.16)–(10.17) admits a solution, for t ∈J:

the assumptions made. By Proposition 10.11 the solution found is unique, because
A ≥0 and Ker(A) = {0} from the lower bound γ 2 + ε > 0 of σ(A).
That ut is C1 (as it should) descends from a computation of the derivative, which
needs Stone’s theorem, and the boundedness of (A −γ 2I)−1/2 (it has bounded
spectrum). Therefore

is continuous since: ut is continuous as differentiable, and the remaining part of
dut/dt is the action of strongly continuous one-parameter groups on given vectors
(plus an extra continuous factor e−γ t).
That ut is in C2(J; H) goes as follows: write d2ut/dt2 as combination of ut,
dut/dt, Aut and St using the differential equation, and recall ut, dut/dt and St are

10.1 Abstract Differential Equations in Hilbert Spaces
553
Example 10.14 A frequent situation in classical applications is that in which the
self-adjoint operator A satisﬁes A ≥εI for some ε > 0 and has compact resolvent
(by Corollary 8.6 it sufﬁces for this to happen at one point of the resolvent set).
The resolvent’s spectrum computed at ε/2 (so that to have a self-adjoint operator) is
made by eigenvalues only, possibly with 0 as point of the continuous spectrum, and
every eigenspace is ﬁnite-dimensional by Theorem 4.19. Proposition 9.17 implies
σ(A) = σp(A), since σ(A) = {μ−1 + ε/2 | μ ∈σ(Rε/2(A))} and every eigenvector
of the resolvent Rε/2(A) is an eigenvector for A. Each eigenspace of A has ﬁnite
dimension, as it corresponds to an eigenspace (with non-zero eigenvalue) of the
compact resolvent Rε/2(A).
For example, this is the case when −A is the closure of the Laplacian on the
relatively compact open set Ω ⊂Rn, with D(Δ) containing maps ψ ∈C2(Ω)
vanishing at the boundary and whose derivatives up to order two are ﬁnite on ∂Ω.
Then the Laplacian is essentially self-adjoint and the closure’s resolvent is compact.
If c > 0 is constant (the travelling speed of waves in the medium), the equation
d2ut
dt2 −c2Δut = 0
presides over the evolution of the vertical deformation ut(x) of a ﬂat horizontal elastic
membrane represented by the region Ω ⊂R2, assumed to be ﬁxed at the rim.
Let A := −c2Δ, and call {φn}n∈N an eigenvector basis for A with corresponding
eigenvalues 0 < ε ≤λ0 ≤λ1 ≤λ2 ≤· · · . Decompose the initial conditions v, v′:
v =

The solution clearly oscillates by the system’s natural frequencies (eigenfrequen-

It should be clear that the solution set to the Klein–Gordon equation with source and
dissipative term (10.16) – if not empty – consists of maps
J ∋t →u(0)
t
+ st ,
where s is an arbitrary, but ﬁxed, solution to (10.4), while u(0) varies in the vector
space of solutions to the homogeneous equation (possibly with dissipative term).
This solution exists if the source is regular enough. In fact the following analogue to
Theorem 10.8 holds.

Example 10.16
(1) In the hypotheses of Theorem 10.15 let us consider a physical system described
by the Klein–Gordon equation with dissipative term, and periodic source
St = eiωtψ
where ω ∈R is a given constant and ψ ∈D(A). Under Theorem 10.15, but explicitly
with γ > 0, we want to study the solution u = ut of the Cauchy problem with initial
conditions v, v′ in the “far future”, meaning t >> 1. Provided γ > 0, a direct
computation (see Exercise 10.1) following from (10.24) yields:

for Cω,t ∈B(H), ||Cω,t|| ≤Kω, some constant Kω ≥0 and any t ≥0. Assuming
γ > 0, the resolvent of A at ω2 −2iγ , i.e. (A−ω2I +2iγ Iω)−1, is well deﬁned and
in B(H), as σ(A) ⊂(0, +∞) by assumption. For large t > 0 only the last summand
in ut above survives. The term e−γ tCω,tψ tends to zero in the norm of H and the part
of solution depending on the initial conditions also goes to zero, because:

10

where we call
u(∞,ψ,ω)
t

the long-time solution.
(2) Referring to example (1), we shall explain the phenomenon called resonance.If
the source oscillates at a frequency ω that is (up to sign) in the spectrum of A, then
the smaller the damping term γ is, the larger the long-time solution u(∞,ψ,ω)
t
can
be rendered by choosing a suitable ψ. In fact let P(A) be the PVM of A and set
I δ
ω := [ω2 −δ, ω2 + δ], for δ > 0 ﬁnite. If the source is given by the unit vector

This is all the more evident if the resolvent of A is compact (see Example 10.14),

In contrast to solution (10.22), which arises in absence of source and dissipation,
the long-time solution, besides having lost track of the initial conditions, no longer
oscillates by the natural frequencies √λn of the system described by A as in (10.22);
rather, the oscillations are forced by the frequencies of the source ω j. However, the
system’s eigenfrequencies leave traces in the denominator on the right of (10.26),
thus generating resonance. That is why the sound of a violin essentially depends on
the harmonic1 frequencies of the strings ω j despite being produced by the sound
board, whose non-harmonic resonance frequencies are λ j ̸= ω j.

10.1.3
The Abstract Heat Equation
In the standard theory of PDEs the heat equation is parabolic. Coefﬁcients apart,
whose meaning – albeit relevant – we shall ignore, the heat equation over a given
open set Ω ⊂Rn reads:
∂
∂t ut(x) + (A0ut)(x) = S(t, x) .
(10.27)
Above
A0 := −Δx : D(A0) →L2(Ω, dx)
(10.28)
for some domain D(A0) ⊂C2(Ω), with Δx being the Laplace operator on Rn.
A map u = u(t, x) is a classical solution to (10.27) if it is deﬁned for (t, x) ∈
[0, b) × Ω with b ∈(0, +∞] given, continuous on [0, b) × Ω, differentiable with
continuity in t and twice in x1, . . . , xn on (0, b) × Ω, and clearly if it solves (10.27)
on (0, b) × Ω.
Assuming, as before, that A := A0 is self-adjoint leads to a generalised interpreta-
tion of (10.27), where A0 is replaced by any self-adjoint operator and t-differentiation
is meant in the Hilbert space.
Fix b ∈(0, +∞]. If A : D(A) →H is self-adjoint on the Hilbert space H and
[0, b) ∋t →St ∈H is continuous and ﬁxed in C((0, b); H), the abstract heat
equation with source is
d
dt ut + Aut = St .
(10.29)
1Harmonic here means that these frequencies are integer multiples of a fundamental frequency. The
presence of a fundamental frequency makes the distinction between sound and noise.

558
10
Spectral Theory III: Applications
The unknown is the continuous map u : [0, b) →D(A) with u ∈C1((0, b); D(A)).
Continuity and derivative are meant in H. The source is the map S = St. As usual,
if St = 0 for any t ∈[0, b) the Eq.(10.29) is homogeneous.
The Cauchy problem for the heat equation, with source or homogeneous, seeks
a C1 map u : [0, b) →D(A) solving (10.29), respectively with source or homoge-
neous, together with the initial condition:
u0 = v ∈D(A).
(10.30)
Remark 10.17 If A0 is of the form (10.28) and essentially self-adjoint, we may
consider a classical solution u = u(t, x) to (10.27), for which u(t, ·) ∈D0(A0) for
any t ∈[0, b). Under assumptions of the kind of Proposition 10.3, this solution will
solve the abstract equation (10.29) too, since D(A) = D(A0) ⊃D(A0). Therefore
under relatively mild hypotheses classical solutions are abstract solutions.
■
The next result guarantees the abstract heat equation has a unique solution for any
initial condition, provided the operator A is positive.
Proposition 10.18 If A is self-adjoint and A ≥0, and u = ut solves the homoge-
neous equation (10.29), then
||ut|| ≤||u0|| for any t ∈[0, b).
(10.31)
Hence, for A ≥0, the Cauchy problem (10.29)–(10.30), with St ̸= 0 in general, has
at most one solution.
Proof By (10.1) and (10.29), for St = 0:
d
dt ||ut||2 = d
dt (ut|ut) = −(Aut|ut) −(ut|Aut) ≤0
as A is self-adjoint. Hence ||ut|| ≤||ut0|| if t ≥t0 ∈(0, b). By continuity the
estimate holds at t0 = 0. Uniqueness is proved as follows. If u, u′ solve the Cauchy
problem (with the same St), then J ∋t →ut −u′
t solves the Cauchy problem
(10.29) with St = 0 and initial condition u0 = 0. Then 0 ≤||ut −u′
t|| ≤||0|| = 0
for any t ∈J and hence ut = u′
t for any t ≥0.
□
Now we go for an existence result.
Proposition 10.19 If A is self-adjoint and A ≥0, a (hence, the) solution to the
Cauchy problem (10.29)–(10.30) reads:
ut = e−t Av ,
t ∈[0, b) ,
where the exponential is meant in spectral sense.

10.1 Abstract Differential Equations in Hilbert Spaces
559
Proof Take ψ ∈H and t, t′ ∈[0, b). Observe, as σ(A) ⊂[0, +∞), that Theorem
9.4 implies e−t A ∈B(H) if t ≥0, e−0A = I and also:
||e−t Aψ−e−t′ Aψ||2 =
	
σ(A)
|e−λt −e−λt′|2dμψ(λ) =
	
[0,+∞)
|e−λt −e−λt′|2dμψ(λ).
Since μψ is ﬁnite, if we bound the integrand uniformly in t, t′ in a given neighbour-
hood by some constant, dominated convergence forces ||e−t Aψ −e−t′ Aψ||2 →0
as t →t′. Consequently ut := e−t Av is continuous on [0, +∞), and in particular
u0 = v.
Suppose v ∈D(A), so
	
[0,+∞)
|λ|2dμv(λ) < +∞.
Assume as well
	
[0,+∞)
λ2e−2λtdμv(λ) < +∞,
justiﬁed by λ ≥0 and t ≥0, so 0 ≤e−λt ≤1. Then for t ∈(0, b):
	
[0,+∞)

e−λ(t+h) −e−λt
h
−λ


dμv(λ) →0 as h →0,
because the integrand tends pointwise to 0 as h →0 and is bounded, uniformly
around h = 0, by the map [0, +∞)λ →Cλ2e−2λt (integrable if ν ∈D(A)). Thus
we proved


1
h (e−(t+h)A −e−t A)ν −Aν


2
→0 as h →0,
if t ∈(0, +∞). That means ut := e−t Av solves (10.29) for t ∈(0, b). Recalling
Theorem 9.4(f):

So with a similar argument involving Lebesgue’s dominated convergence and using
λe−tλ ≤1/t, we immediately ﬁnd dut
dt (t) is continuous in (0, +∞). Consequently
u ∈C1((0, b); D(A)), as needed.
□
Remark 10.20
(1) If v /∈D(A), we may still deﬁne ut := e−t Av, since the domain of the operator
e−t A is H. The map [0, b) ∋t →ut does not solve the homogeneous heat equation.
Since (e−t A)∗= e−t A, though:

560
10
Spectral Theory III: Applications
d
dt (z|ut) + (Az|ut) = 0 for any z ∈D(A), t ∈(0, b).
(10.32)
The map [0, b) ∋t →ut is called a weak solution to the homogeneous heat
equation.
(2) For A ≥0 self-adjoint, the set of operators Tt := e−t A, t ≥0, is a strongly
continuous semigroup of operators (see Remark 9.38) generated by the self-adjoint
operator A. Put otherwise the functions [0, +∞) ∋t →Tt, beside being strongly
continuous (cf. above), satisfy T0 = I and TtTs = Tt+s, t, s ∈[0, +∞).
From λne−λt ≤Cnt−n, with Cn := nne−n, n ≥0, t, λ > 0, we obtain, for a
self-adjoint operator A ≥0 on H:
||AnTtψ||2 =
	
[0,+∞)
|λne−λt|2dμψ(λ) ≤C2
nt−2n
for any unit vector ψ ∈H (bearing in mind Theorem 9.4(c)). Therefore:
||AnTt|| ≤Cnt−n .
In particular:
Ran(Ttψ) ⊂D(An) for any n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , ψ ∈H and t > 0.
When A is, say, the closure of −Δ on S (Rn), then
ψt := e−tΔψ ∈D(Δ
n) for any n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , ψ ∈L2(Rn, dx) and t > 0.
Using the Fourier–Plancherel transform (see Sect.3.7), we obtain easily that ψt
admits weak derivatives (Deﬁnition 5.24) of any order, and the latter belong to
L2(Rn, dx). Well-known results of Sobolev (cf. [Rud91], always with t > 0) imply
ψt is in C∞(Rn) up to a zero-measure set; on the other hand ψt →ψ as t →0+
in L2(Rn, dx). In this sense semigroups generated by elliptic operators like −Δ are
employed to regularise functions.
(3) It should be clear, once again, that the solutions to the heat equation with source
(10.29) – if they exist – have the form
J ∋t →u(0)

where s is any ﬁxed solution to (10.29) and u(0) roams the vector space of homoge-
neous solutions.

Hilbert Tensor Products
We shall see in Chap.13 that composite quantum systems in elementary QM are
described on tensor products of the Hilbert spaces of the component subsystems. We
will explain in the sequel what exactly a tensor product in the category of Hilbert
spaces is, and assume the reader has a familiarity with (standard) tensor products of
ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces [Lan10] for general motivations and the notations
used. For the inﬁnite-dimensional case we shall follow the approach of [ReSi80].
10.2.1
Tensor Product of Hilbert Spaces and Spectral
Properties
Consider n (complex) Hilbert spaces (Hi, (·|·)i), i = 1, 2, . . . , n, and choose a vector
vi in each Hi. Mimicking the ﬁnite-dimensional situation one can deﬁne the tensor
product v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vn of the vi as the multilinear functional:
v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vn : H′
1 × · · · × H′
n ∋( f1, . . . , fn) →f1(v1) · · · fn(vn) ∈C ,
whereH′
i isthetopologicaldualtoHi andthedots·,onthefarright,denotetheproduct
of complex numbers. Equivalently, by Riesz’s theorem, we may deﬁne the action of
v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vn on n-tuples in H1 × · · · × Hn rather than on H′
1 × · · · × H′
n. This keeps
trackoftheanti-isomorphism(builtfromtheinnerproduct)thatidentiﬁesdualHilbert
spaces. In this manner v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vn acts on n-tuples (u1, . . . , un) ∈H1 × · · · × Hn
via the inner products, and induces an antilinear functional in each variable. This
latter, more viable, deﬁnition will be our choice.
Deﬁnition 10.21 Consider n (complex) Hilbert spaces (Hi, (·|·)i), i = 1, 2, . . . , n,
and pick one vector vi in each Hi. The tensor product v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vn of v1, . . . , vn is
the mapping:
v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vn : H1 × · · · × Hn ∋(u1, . . . , un) →(u1|v1)1 · · · (un|vn)n ∈C .
(10.33)
With T n
i=1Hi we denote the collection of maps {v1⊗· · ·⊗vn|vi ∈Hi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n}
while 
n
i=1Hi is the C-vector space of ﬁnite linear combinations of tensor products
v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vn ∈T n
i=1Hi.
Remark 10.22 From this deﬁnition it is evident that the mapping v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vn :
H1 × · · · × Hn →C is conjugate-multilinear, that is antilinear in each variable
ui ∈Hi separately, as we see from (10.33), since the inner product is conjugate-
linear on the left. This notwithstanding, (v1, . . . vn) →v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vn is multilinear,
as one proves immediately.

Spectral Theory III: Applications
Let us show how we may deﬁne an inner product (·|·) on 
n
i=1Hi. Consider the map
S : T n
i=1Hi × T n
i=1Hi →C,
S(v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vn, v′
1 ⊗· · · ⊗v′
n) := (v1|v′
1) · · · (vn|v′
n).
(10.34)
The following result holds.
Proposition 10.23 The mapping S : T n
i=1Hi × T n
i=1Hi →C extends, by linearity in
the right slot and antilinearity in the left, to a unique Hermitian inner product on the
complex space 

for Ψ = 
i αiv1i ⊗· · · ⊗vni and Φ = 
j β ju1 j ⊗· · · ⊗unj (both sums being
ﬁnite).
Proof Just to preserve readability let us reduce to the case n = 2. If n > 2 the proof
is conceptually identical, only more tedious to write. Take Ψ, Φ ∈H1⊗H2. First we
have to show that distinct decompositions of the same vectors
Ψ =

(10.36)
This would prove that the extension of S to H1⊗H2 is well deﬁned, for it does not
depend on the particular representatives S acts on. So let us prove this fact just for
the right variable (10.35), because for (10.36) the argument is similar. The left-hand
side in (10.35) may be written:


where we used Φ =

k = 
s δszs ⊗z′
s. Therefore S extends uniquely to
a map, linear in the second argument and antilinear in the ﬁrst, (·|·) : H1⊗H2 →C.
By deﬁnition of S:
(Ψ |Φ) = (Φ|Ψ ) .
To prove that (·|·) is indeed a Hermitian inner product we just have to show positive
deﬁniteness. That is easy. If Ψ = n
j=1 α jv j ⊗v′
j, where n < +∞by assumption,
consider the (ﬁnite!) orthonormal basis u1, . . . , um (m ≤n) in the span of v1, . . . , vn,
and a similar basis u′
1, . . . , u′
l, (l ≤n) in the span of v′
1, . . . , v′
n. Using the bilinearity
of ⊗, we can write Ψ = m
j=1

deﬁnition of S and since the bases are orthonormal, we obtain

Deﬁnition 10.24 Consider n (complex) Hilbert spaces (Hi, (·|·)i), i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
The (Hilbert) tensor product of the Hi, written n
i=1 Hi or H1 ⊗· · · ⊗Hn, is the
completion of 
n
i=1Hi with respect to the inner product (·|·) of Proposition 10.23.
It is immediate to verify that the deﬁnition reduces to the elementary (algebraic) one
if the spaces Hi are ﬁnite-dimensional. Moreover, the next results hold.
Proposition 10.25 Take n (complex) Hilbert spaces (Hi, (·|·)i) with Hilbert bases
Ni ⊂Hi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Then
N := {z1 ⊗· · · ⊗zn | zi ∈Ni , i = 1, 2, . . . , n}
is a Hilbert basis for H1 ⊗· · · ⊗Hn. In particular, H1 ⊗· · · ⊗Hn is separable if
every Hi is.
Proof By construction N is an orthonormal system (by deﬁnition of inner product
on the tensor product). We have to prove ⟨N⟩is dense in H1 ⊗· · · ⊗Hn. As linear
combinations of the v1 ⊗· · ·⊗vn are dense in H1 ⊗· · ·⊗Hn, it is enough to show any
v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vn can be approximated arbitrarily well by combinations of z1 ⊗· · · ⊗zn
in N. To simplify the notation we will reduce again to n = 2, since the general
case n > 2 goes in the same way. For suitable coefﬁcients γz and βz′, we have
v1 = 
z∈N1 γzz and v2 = 
z′∈N2 βz′z′, so (Theorem 3.26 and Deﬁnition 3.19):

increasing F. This ends the proof.
□
Proposition 10.26 Let (Hi, (·|·)i) be (complex) Hilbert spaces, Di ⊂Hi dense
subspaces, i = 1, 2, . . . , n. The subspace D1 ⊗· · · ⊗Dn ⊂H1 ⊗· · · ⊗Hn, spanned
by tensor products v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vn, vi ∈Di, i = 1, . . . , n, is dense in H1 ⊗· · · ⊗Hn.
Proof As is by now customary, we prove the claim for n = 2. Finite combinations
of tensor products u ⊗v are dense in H1 ⊗H2, so it is enough to prove the following:
if ψ := u ⊗v ∈H1 ⊗H2, there exists a sequence in D1 ⊗D2 converging to ψ.
By construction there exist sequences {un}n∈N ⊂D1 and {vn}n∈N ⊂D2 respectively
tending to u and v. Then
||un ⊗vn −u ⊗v|| ≤||un ⊗vn −un ⊗v|| + ||un ⊗v −u ⊗v|| .
But ||un ⊗vn −un ⊗v||2 = ||un ⊗(vn −v)||2 = ||un||2
1||vn −v||2
2 →0 as n →+∞,
because if the un converge then {||un||1}n∈N is bounded. Similarly ||un⊗v−u⊗v||2 =
||(un −u) ⊗v||2 = ||un −u||2
1||v||2
2 →0 as n →+∞.
□
Example 10.27
(1) We will exemplify Hilbert tensor products by showing that for separable L2 spaces
(the spaces of wavefunctions in QM), the Hilbert tensor product may be understood
alternatively using product measures.
Consider a pair of separable Hilbert spaces L2(Xi, μi), i = 1, 2, and assume both
measures are σ-ﬁnite, so that the product μ1 ⊗μ2 is well deﬁned on X1 × X2.
Proposition 10.28 Let L2(Xi, μi) be separable Hilbert spaces, i = 1, 2, with σ-
ﬁnite measures. Then
L2(X1 × X2, μ1 ⊗μ2) and
L2(X1, μ1) ⊗L2(X2, μ2)
are canonically isomorphic as Hilbert spaces.

10.2 Hilbert Tensor Products
565
The unitary identiﬁcation is the unique linear bounded extension of:
U0 : L2(X1, μ1) ⊗L2(X2, μ2) ∋ψ ⊗φ →ψ · φ ∈L2(X1 × X2, μ1 ⊗μ2)
where (ψ · φ)(x, y) := ψ(x)φ(y), x ∈X1, y ∈X2.
Proof First, if N1 := {ψn}n∈N and N2 := {φn}n∈N are bases of L2(X1, μ1) and
L2(X2, μ2) respectively, then N := {ψn ·φm}(n,m)∈N×N is a basis in L2(X1×X2, μ1⊗
μ2). It is clearly an orthonormal system by elementary properties of the product
measure, and if f ∈L2(X1 × X2, μ1 ⊗μ2) is such that
	
X×X2
f (x, y)ψn(x)φm(y)dμ1(x) ⊗dμ2(y) = 0
for any ψn · φm, by Fubini–Tonelli we have:
	
X2
	
X1
f (x, y)ψn(x)dμ1(x)

φm(y)dμ2(y) = 0 .
As the φm form a basis
	
X1
f (x, y)ψn(x)dμ1(x) = 0 ,
except for a set Sm ⊂X2 of zero μ2-measure. Then for y /∈S := ∪m∈NSm (of zero
measure as countable union of zero-measure sets):
	
X1
f (x, y)ψn(x)dμ1(x) = 0
for any ψn ∈N1, which implies f (x, y) = 0 except for x ∈B, B having zero
μ1-measure. Overall f (x, y) = 0, with the exception of the points in S × B, of zero
measure for μ1 ⊗μ2 by elementary properties of product measure. Viewing f as in
L2(X1 × X2, μ1 ⊗μ2), we then have f = 0. Consequently N is a basis, being an
orthonormal system with trivial orthogonal complement.
ConsidertheuniqueboundedlinearfunctionU mappingthebasiselementψn⊗φm
of L2(X1, μ1)⊗L2(X2, μ2) to the basis element ψn ·φm of L2(X1×X2, μ1⊗μ2). By
construction U is unitary. Moreover, U sends ψ ⊗φ ∈L2(X1, μ1) ⊗L2(X2, μ2) to
the corresponding ψ ·φ ∈L2(X1 ×X2, μ1 ⊗μ2) (just note ψ ⊗φ and ψ ·φ have the
same components in the respective bases), so U is a linear unitary extension of U0.
Any other linear bounded extension U ′ of U0 must reduce to U on bases ψn ⊗φm,
ψn · φm, and as such it coincides with U by linearity and continuity.
□
The result clearly generalises to n-fold products of L2 spaces with separable σ-ﬁnite
measures.

Spectral Theory III: Applications
(2) Here is another important result about Hilbert tensor products, that deals with the
case where all summands Hk of a Hilbert sum (Deﬁnition 3.67) coincide.
Proposition 10.29 If H is a Hilbert space and 0 < n ∈N is ﬁxed, the Hilbert space
H ⊗Cn is naturally isomorphic to %n
k=1 H.
The unitary identiﬁcation is the unique linear bounded extension of
V0 : H ⊗Cn ∋ψ ⊗(v1, . . . , vn) →(v1ψ, . . . , vnψ) ∈
n
&
k=1
H .
Proof The proof is similar to the one in example (1). Fix a Hilbert basis N ⊂H, so
by construction the vectors
(ψ, 0, . . . , 0), (0, ψ, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , (0, . . . , 0, ψ)
form a basis of %n
k=1 H as ψ varies in N. Take the unique linear bounded transfor-
mation mapping ψ ⊗ei to (0, . . . , ψ, . . . , 0), where: ψ ∈N, ei is the ith canonical
vector in Cn, and the only non-zero entry in the n-tuple, ψ, is in the ith place. This
is easily unitary, and restricts to V0 on ψ ⊗(v1, . . . , vn). Uniqueness is proved in
analogy to example (1).
□
(3) The Fock space F(H) generated by H is the inﬁnite Hilbert sum
F(H) :=

Remark 10.30 This discussion begs the question whether it makes sense to deﬁne
a tensor product of inﬁnitely many Hilbert spaces. The answer is yes (see [BrRo02,
vol.1]). The deﬁnition, however, depends on certain choices. Consider a collection
{Hα}α∈Λ of Hilbert spaces (over C) of any cardinality. Fix unit vectors ψα ∈Hα and
U := {ψα}α∈Λ. We can construct the Hilbert tensor product (U)
α∈Λ Hα of as many
Hilbert spaces as we like in the following way.
(1) Take the subspace in ×α∈ΛHα of elements (xα)α∈Λ for which only ﬁnitely
many xα are distinct from the corresponding ψα. Deﬁne conjugate-linear maps in
each argument ⊗αφα : ×α∈ΛHα →C by ⊗βφβ((xα)α) := Πα∈Λ(xα|φα)α, where,
again, only ﬁnitely many φα (depending on ⊗αφα) do not belong in U. Consider the
ﬁnite span 
⊗(U)α∈ΛHα of the functionals ⊗α∈Λφα.
(2) Now deﬁne ⊗(U)
α∈ΛHα to be the completion of 
⊗(U)α∈ΛHα in the norm generated
by the only inner product such that (⊗αφα| ⊗α φ′
α) := Πα(φα|φ′
α)α.
If Λ is ﬁnite it is not hard to see that the deﬁnition reduces to the previous one,
and does not depend on the choice of U. This fact ceases to hold, in general, if Λ is
inﬁnite.

10.2.2
Tensor Product of Operators
As ﬁnal mathematical topic we discuss the Hilbert tensor product of operators. If A
and B are operators with domains D(A) and D(B) in the respective Hilbert spaces
H1 and H2, we will denote by D(A) ⊗D(B) ⊂H1 ⊗H2 the subspace of ﬁnite
combinations of elements ψ ⊗φ, with ψ ∈D(A), φ ∈D(B). Let us try to deﬁne
an operator:
A⊗B : D(A) ⊗D(B) →H1 ⊗H2
by extending linearly ψ ⊗φ →(Aψ) ⊗(Bφ). The question is whether it is well
deﬁned. So suppose, for Ψ ∈D(A) ⊗D(B), to have two (ﬁnite!) decompositions
Ψ =

k
ckψk ⊗φk =

We have to check that

Take a basis (ﬁnite!) of vectors fr for the joint span of the ψk and the ψ′

j. In particular,
ψi ⊗φi =

making A ⊗B well deﬁned indeed. The procedure extends trivially to N operators

Spectral Theory III: Applications
Deﬁnition 10.31 If Hk, k = 1, 2, . . . , N, are Hilbert spaces and Ak : D(Ak) →Hk
operators with domains D(Ak) ⊂Hk, the (Hilbert) tensor product of the Ak is the
unique operator
A1 ⊗· · · ⊗AN : D(Ak) ⊗· · · ⊗D(AN) →H1 ⊗· · · ⊗HN
extending
A1 ⊗· · · ⊗AN (v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vN ) = (A1v1) ⊗· · · ⊗(AN vN ) for vk ∈D(Ak), k = 1, . . . , N.
In view of the applications the next elementary result is useful.
Proposition 10.32 Let Ak : D(Ak) →Hk, k = 1, . . . , N, be operators on Hilbert
spaces Hk.
(a) If D(Ak) = Hk and Ak is closable for any k, then all operators of the form
B1 ⊗· · · ⊗Bn
with Bk ∈{Ik, Ak} for k = 1, . . . , N
(Ik is the identity operator on Hk) or Ak and their ﬁnite combinations, deﬁned
on
D(A1) ⊗· · · ⊗D(AN) ,
are closable;
(b) if D(Ak) = Hk and Ak ∈B(Hk) for k = 1, 2, . . . , N, then:
(i) A1 ⊗· · · ⊗AN ∈B(H1 ⊗· · · ⊗HN) and
(ii) ||A1 ⊗· · · ⊗AN|| = ||A1|| · · · ||AN||.
Proof (a) Let us study n = 2, the rest being completely analogous. Note D(A1) ⊗
D(A2) is dense by construction (use Proposition 10.26), so the operators in (a)
have adjoints. The generic element Ψ ∈D(A∗
1) ⊗D(A∗
2), by deﬁnition, satisﬁes
(Ψ |A1 ⊗A2Φ) = (A∗
1 ⊗A∗
2Ψ |Φ) for any Φ ∈D(A1) ⊗D(A2). By deﬁnition of
adjoint
D(A∗
1) ⊗D(A∗
2) ⊂D((A1 ⊗A2)∗) .
Apply Theorem 5.10(b), for A1, A2 densely deﬁned and closable, to the effect that
the adjoints are densely deﬁned and so D((A1 ⊗A2)∗) is, too. Therefore A1 ⊗A2
is closable, by Theorem 5.10(b) again. For linear combinations the argument is the
same. Claim (b) is proved in the exercise section.

Atthispointwewishtoconsiderpolynomialsofoperators A1⊗· · ·⊗AN,when Ak are

Q should be understood as I ⊗· · · ⊗I ⊗Ak ⊗I ⊗· · · ⊗I, but we will simplify the
otherwise cumbersome notation.

10.2 Hilbert Tensor Products

Theorem 10.33 Let Ak : D(Ak) →Hk, D(Ak) ⊂Hk, k = 1, 2, . . . , N, be self-
adjoint operators and Q(a1, . . . , an) a real polynomial of degree nk in the kth
variable. Let Dk ⊂D(Ak) be a domain on which Ank
k is essentially self-adjoint
(Dk := D(Ak), in particular). The following statements are true.
(a) Q (A1, . . . , A1) is essentially self-adjoint on N
k=1 Dk;
(b) If every Hk is separable, the spectrum of Q (A1, . . . , AN) is:
σ

Q (A1, . . . AN)

= Q (σ(A1), . . . , σ(AN)) .
Proof (a) The operator Q(A1, . . . , An) is well deﬁned on D := ⊗N
k=1D(Ank
k ) (in
particular by Theorem 9.4(d)) and symmetric, by a direct computation involv-
ing the deﬁnition of tensor product and the fact that Q has real coefﬁcients and
every Am
k , m ≤nk is symmetric on D(Ank
k ). More can be said: Q(A1, . . . , An)
is essentially self-adjoint on D, by Nelson’s Theorem 5.47, for we can exhibit
a set of analytic vectors for Q(A1, . . . , An) whose span is dense in the overall
Hilbert space. Keeping in mind Example 10.27(1) and the proof of Proposition
9.25(f), a set of analytic vectors is given by tensor products ψ(L,1)
αL
⊗· · · ⊗ψ(L,N)
αL
,
L = 1, 2, . . ., where {ψ(L,k)
αL
}αL∈GL ⊂D(Ak) is a Hilbert basis for the closed sub-
space P(Ak)([−L, L)∩σ(Ak)), and P(Ak) is the spectral measure of Ak. Each time L
increases by 1, and [−L, L) gets replaced by [−L−1, −L)∪[−L, L)∪[L, L+1), we
must care to keep the same basis for the subspace associated to [−L, L). That those
vectors are analytic for Q(A1, . . . , An) is easy, just replicating the proof of Proposi-
tion 9.25(f). To prove Q(A1, . . . , An) is essentially self-adjoint on D(e) := ⊗N

it sufﬁces to prove the inclusion Q(A1, . . . , An)↾D(e) ⊃Q(A1, . . . , An)↾D (by con-
struction, in fact, Q(A1, . . . , An)↾D(e)⊂Q(A1, . . . , An)↾D so Q(A1, . . . , An)↾D(e) ⊂
Q(A1, . . . , An)↾D; if, further, Q(A1, . . . , An)↾D(e) ⊃Q(A1, . . . , An)↾D, then
Q(A1, . . . , An)↾D(e) = Q(A1, . . . , An)↾D
and the right side is self-adjoint, whence Q(A1, . . . , An) ↾D(e) is essentially self-
adjoint being symmetric with self-adjoint closure.)
To prove Q(A1, . . . , An)↾D(e) ⊃Q(A1, . . . , An)↾D assume ⊗N
k=1φk ∈D. Then
φk ∈D(Ank
k ), and Dk being the domain of essential self-adjointness of Ank
k , there
exists a sequence {φl

k →φk and Ank
k φl
k →Ank
k φk, as l →+∞. A simple
estimate involving the spectral decomposition of Ak tells Am

of ⊗N
k=1φk, which implies Q(A1, . . . , An)↾D(e) ⊃Q(A1, . . . , An)↾D.
(b) Using Theorem 9.18(c) and remembering the separability of each Hk, we rep-
resent every Ak via a multiplication operator by Fk on the Hilbert space L2(Mk, μk)
identiﬁed with Hk. We remind ⊗N
k L2(Mk, μk) is isomorphic to L2(×N
k=1Mk, μ), μ =
⊗N
k=1μk, as we saw in Example 10.27(1). Under that correspondence Q(A1, . . . , AN)
on D is mapped to the multiplication by Q(F1, . . . , FN), and D corresponds to

the span, inside L2(×N

Fnk
k · φk ∈L2(Mk, μk).
Suppose λ ∈Q(σ(A1), . . . , σ(AN)). If I ∋λ is an open interval, Q−1(I) ⊃
×N
k=1Ik for some open interval Ik ⊂R, so that Ik ∩σ(Ak) ̸= ∅for any k =
1, 2, . . . , N. Notice σ(Ak) = ess ran(Fk), by Exercise 9.4. Therefore μk(F−1
k (Ik)) ̸=
0, and so μ[Q(F1, . . . , FN)−1(I)] ̸= 0. This means λ ∈ess ranQ(F1, . . . , FN) =
σ(Q(A1, . . . , PN)) by Exercise 9.4. Conversely, if λ /∈Q(σ(A1), . . . , σ(AN)) the
function
(λ −Q(F1, . . . , FN)) : ×N
k=1Mk →R
is bounded, hence λ ∈ρ(Q(A1, . . . , AN)), i.e. λ /∈σ(Q(A1, . . . , AN)).

To conclude, consider two von Neumann algebras R1, R2 on complex Hilbert spaces
H1, H2. There is a corresponding tensor product of von Neumann algebras R1 ⊗R2.
Deﬁnition 10.34 IfR1 andR2 arevonNeumannalgebrasoncomplexHilbertspaces
H1 and H2 respectively, their tensor product R1 ⊗R2 is the von Neumann algebra
on H1 ⊗H2 given by the strong completion in B(H1 ⊗H2) of the unital ∗-algebra
of ﬁnite combinations of products A1 ⊗A2, with A1 ∈R1, A2 ∈R2.
The generalisation to ﬁnite products is straightforward, while the tensor product of
inﬁnitely many von Neumann algebras is more complicated to deﬁne.
The important theorem on the commutant of tensor products of von Neumann
algebras [KaRi97, vol. II, p. 821] asserts what follows.
Theorem 10.35 If Rk, k = 1, . . . , N, are von Neumann algebras on complex
Hilbert spaces Hk respectively, then
(R1 ⊗· · · ⊗Rk)′ = R′
1 ⊗· · · ⊗R′
k .
(10.39)
An elementary but important consequence is the following. Referring to the largest
von Neumann algebras on H1 and H2 we then have
(B(H1) ⊗B(H2))′ = {c1I1}c1∈C ⊗{c2I2}c2∈C = {cI}c∈C ,
and hence
(B(H1) ⊗B(H2))′′ = {cI}′
c∈C = B(H1 ⊗H2) .
On the other hand, using (10.39) twice, we also get:
(B(H1) ⊗B(H2))′′ = B(H1)′′ ⊗B(H2)′′ = B(H1) ⊗B(H2) .
Summing up, we recover the known fact
B(H1) ⊗B(H2) = B(H1 ⊗H2) .

10.2.3
An Example: The Orbital Angular Momentum
The observables corresponding to the three Cartesian components of the orbital
angular momentum of a particle, in QM, are the unique self-adjoint extensions of
the operators:
L1 := X2↾S (R3) P3↾S (R3) −X3↾S (R3) P2↾S (R3) ,
L2 := X3↾S (R3) P1↾S (R3) −X1↾S (R3) P3↾S (R3)
L3 := X1↾S (R3) P2↾S (R3) −X2↾S (R3) P1↾S (R3) ,
(10.40)
on the Hilbert space L2(R3, dx) (dx being the Lebesgue measure on R3). Notation-
wise, recall Xi and Pi are the operators position and momentum of Sect.5.3, while
S (R3) is the Schwartz space of smooth complex functions that vanish at inﬁnity
faster than any inverse power of r :=

x2
1 + x2
2 + x2
3 together with all their deriva-
tives (cf. Sect.3.7). In the sequel we will take D(L1) = D(L2) = D(L3) = S (R3)
as domain, since S (R3) is invariant under Xi and Pi (hence under Li). We will show
that the orbital angular momentum operators Li are essentially self-adjoint on
the aforementioned domain, and we will ﬁnd the spectrum and a spectral expression
for them. In this section we shall concentrate on the mathematical features, reserving
any physical consideration for Chaps.11 and 12.
We focus on L3, because the results will apply to the other two by rotating
coordinates. Explicitly:
L3 = −iℏ

x1

∂x2

,
where x1, x2 are viewed as multiplicative operators by the corresponding functions.
A fourth operator used in the sequel is the total angular momentum (squared):
L 2 := L 2
1 + L 2
2 + L 2
3 ,
deﬁned on S (R3). This, too, is essentially self-adjoint on S (R3). We will compute
its spectrum and make the spectral expansion of L2 := L 2 explicit.
It is convenient to write the operators in spherical coordinates r, θ, φ, where
x1 = r sin θ cos φ, x2 = r sin θ sin φ, x3 = r cos θ, so r ∈(0 + ∞), θ ∈(0, π),
φ ∈(−π, π). In this manner a simple computation produces

where operators act on functions in S (R3) whose argument has undergone coor-
dinate change. From (10.41) it is evident that the operators do not depend on the

572

radial coordinate r, a fact of the utmost importance. Keeping that in mind, note that
R3 = S2×[0, +∞), where (up to zero-measure sets) the unit sphere S2 is the domain
of θ, φ, whilst [0, +∞) is where r varies. Furthermore, the Lebesgue measure on
R3 can be seen as the product
dx = dω(θ, φ) ⊗r2dr ,
where
dω(θ, φ) = sin θdθdφ
is the standard measure on S2 identiﬁed with the rectangle (0, π) × (−π, π) by the
spherical angles (θ, φ) (the complement to (0, π) × (−π, π) in S2 has null dω-
measure, so it does not interfere). Thus we obtain the decomposition:
L2(R3, dx) = L2(S2 × [0, +∞), dω(θ, φ) ⊗r2dr) .
By Example 10.27(1):
L2(R, dx) = L2(S2, dω) ⊗L2((0, +∞),r2dr) .
(10.42)
At this point we introduce two operators on the Hilbert space L2(S2, dω):

with domain C∞(S2). As the sphere is a C∞manifold,2 the space C∞(S2) of smooth
maps on S2 is dense in L2(S2, dω) (exercise). These operators are Hermitian, hence
symmetric, as a simple computation reveals. Long before the formulation of QM,
it was known from the study of the Laplace equation (and classical electrodynam-
ics) that there exists a distinguished basis of L2(S2, dω) whose elements are called
spherical harmonics [NiOu82]:

(10.45)
2See Appendix B: the idea is to cover S2 with local charts in θ,φ, by rotating the Cartesian axes.
Three local charts sufﬁce to cover S2. The functions of C∞(S2), by deﬁnition, have domain in S2
and codomain C, and are C∞when restricted to any local chart of the sphere.

10.2 Hilbert Tensor Products
573
The maps Y l
m ∈C∞(S2) are notoriously eigenfunctions of the differential operators
S2L3 and S2L 2 given in (10.43):
S2L3Y l
m = ℏmY l
m ,
S2L 2Y l
m = ℏ2 l(l + 1)Y l
m .
(10.46)
Note how the ﬁrst is obvious by deﬁnition of Y l
m. In particular the vectors Y l
m are
analytic for the symmetric operators S2L 2, S2L3 deﬁned on C∞(S2). As Y l
m form a
basis of L2(S2, dω), by Nelson’s criterion (Theorem 5.47) they warrant essential self-
adjointness to S2L 2, S2L3 on C∞(S2). Following the recipe of Sect.9.1.4 concerning
the Hamiltonian operator of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, we obtain
analogue spectral decompositions (in the strong operator topology):
S2L 2 =

l∈N, m∈Z ,|m|≤l
ℏ2l(l +1)Y l
m(Y l
m| ) and
S2 L3 =

l∈N, m∈Z ,|m|≤l
ℏmY l
m(Y l
m| ). (10.47)
In this context the spectra read
σ(S2L 2) = σp(S2L 2) =
+
ℏ2 l(l + 1)
l = 0, 1, 2 . . .
,
,
(10.48)
and
σ(S2L3) = σp(S2L3) = {ℏm | |m| ≤l , m ∈Z, l = 0, 1, 2 . . . } .
(10.49)
Now let us go back to L2(R3, dx). As the space D(0, +∞) of smooth maps with com-
pact support in (0, +∞) is dense in the separable Hilbert space L2((0 + ∞),r2dr),
by Proposition 3.31(b), there will be a basis {ψn}n∈N of maps in D(0, +∞). Passing
to Cartesian coordinates it is easy to see that
fl,m,n(x) = Y l
m(θ, φ)ψn(r)
(10.50)
belong in C∞(R3) (the only singularity could be at x = 0, but around that point the
maps vanish by construction). By deﬁnition fl,m,n have compact support, so they live
in S (R3). By the deﬁnitions and domains given,
S2L3 ⊗I↾D(0,+∞)⊂L3
and
S2L 2 ⊗I↾D(0,+∞)⊂L 2 ,
so {Y l
m ⊗ψn | n,l ∈N, |m| ≤l , m ∈Z} ⊂S (R3) is a basis of L2(R3, dx) =
L2(S2, dω) ⊗L2((0, +∞),r2dr) by Example 10.27(1). Thinking L3 and L 2 as
acting on S (R3),
L3Y l
m ⊗ψn = ℏmY l
m ⊗ψn ,
L 2Y l
m ⊗ψn = ℏ2 l(l + 1)Y l
m ⊗ψn .
(10.51)
Again, L 2, L3 are essentially self-adjoint on that domain, and their unique self-
adjoint extensions L2 := L 2, L3 := L3 decomposespectrally(inthestrongoperator
topology) as

L2 =

(10.52)
and
L3 =

l,n∈N, m∈Z ,|m|≤l
ℏmY l
m ⊗ψn(Y l
m ⊗ψn|) .
(10.53)
The spectra of L2, L3 remain those of (10.48), (10.49). Note how the spectral mea-
sures of L2, L3 commute.
The same conclusions can be reached using Theorem 10.33 appropriately.
10.3
Polar Decomposition Theorem for Unbounded
Operators
Consider a densely-deﬁned closed operator A : D(A) →H on the Hilbert space
H. Using the fact that A∗A is self-adjoint and positive (as we will see) and by the
spectral theorem for unbounded operators, it is possible to deﬁne the positive self-
adjoint operator |A| :=
√
A∗A. Setting U = A|A|−1 at least on Ran(|A|), and then
extending trivially (as zero) to the complement of Ran(|A|), we immediately ﬁnd
the decomposition
A = U|A| .
Formally, and without caring too much about domains, U ↾Ran(|A|) is an isometry.
Heuristically, this is a generalisation of Theorem 3.82, which we proved for bounded
operators deﬁned on the entire Hilbert space. Our hands-on approach is nevertheless
ﬂawed, in that is does not say where the polar decomposition should be valid (the
domains of A and |A| could be different, a priori) and any attempt to formalise the
argument soon becomes punishing. That is why we will follow an indirect route
based on a more general theorem.
The generalised polar decomposition we will eventually prove plays a crucial part
in rigorous Quantum Field Theory, especially in relationship to the modular theory
of Tomita and Takesaki, and in deﬁning KMS thermal states [BrRo02].
10.3.1
Properties of Operators A∗A, Square Roots
of Unbounded Positive Self-adjoint Operators
We proceed in steps, proving ﬁrst that if A is closed and densely deﬁned, A∗A is self-
adjoint and D(A∗A) is a core for A. Then we will show a result that in some sense
generalises the polar decomposition, thus specifying properly the domains involved.

10.3 Polar Decomposition Theorem for Unbounded Operators
575
At last we will prove the existence and uniqueness of positive self-adjoint square
roots of unbounded self-adjoint operators.
Theorem 10.36 (von Neumann) Consider a closed, densely-deﬁned operator A :
D(A) →H on the Hilbert space H. Then:
(a) A∗A, deﬁned on the standard domain D(A∗A), is self-adjoint;
(b) the dense subspace D(A∗A) is a core for A:
A↾D(A∗A) = A .
(10.54)
Proof For (a), call I : H →H the identity and introduce I + A∗A on its standard
domain (coinciding with D(A∗A), by Deﬁnition 5.1). We claim there is a positive
operator P ∈B(H) such that
(I + A∗A)P = I ,
P(I + A∗A) = I↾D(I+A∗A) .
(10.55)
By Proposition 3.60(f) P ∈B(H) is self-adjoint as positive. By uniqueness of the
inverse the operator I + A∗A coincides with the inverse of P, obtained by spectral
decomposition:
P−1 =
	
σ(P)
λ−1d P(P)(λ) .
This is self-adjoint by Theorem 9.4. Therefore A∗A = (I + A∗A) −I is self-adjoint
on D(I + A∗A) = D(A∗A), which is consequently dense.
Now we have to exhibit the aforementioned positive P ∈B(H) satisfying (10.55).
If f ∈D(I + A∗A) = D(A∗A) then Af ∈D(A∗) by deﬁnition of D(A∗A). Hence
( f | f ) + (Af |Af ) = ( f | f ) + ( f |A∗Af ) = ( f |(I + A∗A) f ) .
We proved (I + A∗A) ≥0, and by Cauchy–Schwarz also || f ||2 ≤|| f || ||(I +
A∗A) f ||, so I + A∗A : D(A∗A) →H is injective. Consider the operator A, closed
and densely deﬁned. The identity of Theorem 5.10(d) says that for any h ∈H there
are unique Ph ∈D(A) and Qh ∈D(A∗) such that
(0, h) = (−APh, Ph) + (Qh, A∗Qh)
(10.56)
in H ⊕H. By construction P, Q are deﬁned on all of H, and the two vectors on the
right, seen in H ⊕H, are orthogonal. By deﬁnition of norm on H ⊕H, the identity
also tells:
||h||2 ≥||Ph||2 + ||Qh||2 ,
for any h ∈H, so P, Q ∈B(H) because ||P||, ||Q|| ≤1. Considering the single
components in (10.56), we have
Q = AP
and h = Ph + A∗Qh = Ph + A∗APh = (I + A∗A)Ph ,

576
10
Spectral Theory III: Applications
for all h ∈H. Hence (I + A∗A)P = I and P : H →D(I + A∗A) must be one-to-
one, but also onto since we saw (I + A∗A) is injective. The inverse of a bijection is
unique, so
P(I + A∗A) = I↾D(I+A∗A) .
Up to now we have proved P ∈B(H) has range covering D(I + A∗A), and that
(10.55) holds. Let us show that P ≥0. If h ∈H, then h = (I + A∗A) f for some
f ∈D(A∗A), so:
(Ph|h) = (P(I + A∗A) f |(I + A∗A) f ) = ( f |(I + A∗A) f ) ≥0 .
To ﬁnish we prove (b). As A is closed, its graph is closed in H ⊕H, so a Hilbert
space itself. Suppose ( f, Af ) ∈G(A) is orthogonal to G(A↾D(A∗A)). Then for any
x ∈D(A∗A):
0 = (( f, Af )|(x, Ax)) = ( f |x) + (Af |Ax) = ( f |x) + ( f |A∗Ax) = ( f |(I + A∗A)x) .
But Ran(I + A∗A) = H, so f = 0 and the orthogonal complement to G(A↾D(A∗A))
in the Hilbert space G(A) is trivial. Therefore G(A↾D(A∗A)) = G(A).
□
Together with the uniqueness for positive roots of (unbounded) positive self-adjoint
operators, the next theorem contains, as subcase, the polar decomposition theorem
for closed and densely-deﬁned operators. Recall that for a pair P, Q with the same
domain D, P ≤Q means ( f |P f ) ≤( f |Q f ) for any f ∈D.
Theorem 10.37 Let A : D(A) →H, B : D(B) →H be closed and densely deﬁned
on the Hilbert space H.
(a) If
D(A∗A) ⊃D(B∗B) and
A∗A↾D(B∗B)≤B∗B ,
(10.57)
then D(A) ⊃D(B) and there exists C ∈B(H) uniquely determined by:
A ⊃C B ,
Ker(C) ⊃Ker(B∗) .
(10.58)
Furthermore, ||C|| ≤1 and C↾(Ran(B))⊥= 0.
(b) If
A∗A ⊃B∗B
(10.59)
then C↾Ran(B) is an isometry and Ker(C) = Ker(B∗).
(c) If
A∗A = B∗B ,
(10.60)
then D(A) = D(B).

10.3 Polar Decomposition Theorem for Unbounded Operators
577
Proof (a) Begin by the uniqueness of C. If C, C′ ∈B(H) and Ax = C Bx,
Ax = C′Bx for x ∈D(B), then C −C′ is the null operator on Ran(B). By conti-
nuity C↾Ran(B)= C′↾Ran(B). From the splitting H = Ran(B) ⊕(Ran(B))⊥, where
(Ran(B))⊥= Ker(B∗), having KerC ⊃Ker(B∗), KerC′ ⊃Ker(B∗) implies
C↾(Ran(B))⊥= C′↾(Ran(B))⊥= 0. Hence C = C′.
Let us prove there exists C ∈B(H) such that A ⊃C B (hence D(B) ⊂D(A)),
Ker(C) ⊃Ker(B∗), ||C|| ≤1 and C↾(Ran(B))⊥= 0.
Call A′, B′ the restrictions of A, B to D(A∗A), D(B∗B) respectively. By the
previous theorem these are cores for A, B, so Ran(A′) = Ran(A) and Ran(B′) =
Ran(B) in particular. Note Ker(A) = Ker(A′), Ker(B) = Ker(B′) for the very
deﬁnition of D(A∗A) and D(B∗B).
Let us deﬁne an operator such that A′ ⊃C B′, to begin with. Deﬁne C on Ran(B′)
such that:
A′ f = C B′ f ,
for every f ∈D(B∗B) ⊂D(A∗A) .
For it to be well deﬁned, we need B′ f = B′g to imply A′ f = A′g, i.e. B′h = 0 ⇒
A′h = 0 for any h ∈D(B∗B) ⊂D(A∗A). But the latter is true, for: B′h = 0 implies
(B′h|B′h) = 0, so 0 = (B′h|B′h) = (h|B∗Bh) ≥(h|A∗Ah) = (A′h|A′h) =
||A′h||2 ≥0. Hence A′h = 0. The claim is that C is bounded on Ran(B′) with
||C|| ≤1. Since A∗A ≤B∗B, using D(A∗A) ⊂D(A) and D(B∗B) ⊂D(B), we
have
||C(B′ f )||2 = (C B′ f |C B′ f ) = (A′ f |A′ f ) = ( f |A∗Af ) ≤( f |B∗B f )
= (B′ f |B′ f ) = ||B′ f ||2 ,
(10.61)
if f ∈D(B∗B) ⊂D(A∗A). Therefore C extends uniquely to Ran(B′) = Ran(B),
preserving ||C|| ≤1. To fully deﬁne C : H →H it sufﬁces to know it on the
complement (Ran(B))⊥= Ker(B∗). Let C be null there. Then C : H →H is
bounded, ||C|| ≤1 and Ker(C) ⊃Ker(B∗). By construction:
Af = C B f
for any f ∈D(B∗B) ⊂D(A∗A) .
Since D(B∗B) is a core for B, if g ∈D(B) there is a sequence { fn}n∈N ⊂D(B∗B) ⊂
D(A∗A) such that fn →g and B fn →Bg. By continuity of C,
lim
n→+∞Afn =
lim
n→+∞C B fn = C lim
n→+∞B fn = C Bg .
But A is closed, so g ∈D(A) and limn→+∞Afn = Ag. Hence A′ = C B′ actually
extends to A = C B on D(B) ⊂D(A).
(b) Assuming A∗A ⊃B∗B, Eq.(10.61) is replaced by:
||C(B′ f )||2 = (C B′ f |C B′ f ) = (A′ f |A′ f ) = ( f |A∗Af ) = ( f |B∗B f ) = (B′ f |B′ f )
= ||B′ f ||2

578
10
Spectral Theory III: Applications
if f ∈D(B∗B) ⊂D(A∗A). Therefore C is an isometry on Ran(B) and by conti-
nuity on Ran(B) as well. There remains to prove Ker(C) ⊂Ker(B∗), for the other
inclusion is valid in the general case (a). If s ∈Ker(C), from H = Ran(B)⊕Ker(B∗)
we have s = r +n, r ∈Ran(B), n ∈Ker(B∗). Since Ker(B∗) ⊂Ker(C), we obtain
0 = Cs = C(r + n) = Cr + Cn = Cr + 0 = Cr. On the other hand C is iso-
metric on Ran(B), so 0 = ||Cr|| = ||r|| and r = 0. Therefore s ∈Ker(C) implies
s = n ∈Ker(B∗), ending the proof of Ker(C) ⊂Ker(B∗).
(c) We show that D(A) = D(B) if A∗A = B∗B. From the proof of the more
general case (a), D(B) ⊂D(A). In the present case A and B can be swapped, so
D(A) = D(B).
□
And now the last ingredient, generalising part of Theorem 3.77.
Theorem 10.38 Let A : D(A) →H be self-adjoint on the Hilbert space H. Then
(a) A ≥0 ⇔σ(A) ⊂[0 + ∞);
(b) if A ≥0, there exists a unique self-adjoint operator B ≥0 such that B2 = A,
where the left-hand side is deﬁned on its standard domain D(B2), coinciding with
D(A).
By using the integral in the spectral measure of A it turns out that B =
√
A.
Proof (a) If σ(A) ⊂[0 + ∞), Theorem 9.4(g), with reference to the PVM P(A)
of A, implies A ≥0. Vice versa, suppose A ≥0 and, by contradiction, that there
exists λ with 0 > λ ∈σ(A). If λ were in σp(A) there would be a λ-eigenvector
ψ ∈H \ {0}, and 0 ≤(ψ|Aψ) = ||ψ||2λ < 0, impossible. Instead, if λ ∈σc(A),
by Theorem 9.13 P(A)
(a,b) ̸= 0 for any open interval (a, b) ∋λ. So we could choose
(a, b) = (2λ, λ/2), getting, for 0 ̸= ψ ∈P(A)
(a,b)(H),
0 ≤(ψ|Aψ) =

(2λ,λ/2)
xdμψ(x) ≤
	
(2λ,λ/2)

2 dμψ(x) = λ
2 ||ψ||2 < 0 ,
using Theorem 9.4 and that μψ vanishes outside (a, b). This is absurd.
(b) A positive self-adjoint root of A is just
B =
√
A :=
	
σ(A)
√xd P(A)(x) .
The operator is well deﬁned, since σ(A) ⊂[0, +∞), it is self-adjoint by Theorem
9.4(b) and B2 = A, where B2 is deﬁned on its standard domain D(B2) = D(A)
by Theorem 9.4(c, d). At last B ≥0 by Theorem 9.4(g). Let us pass to uniqueness.
Assume B ≥0 is self-adjoint and B =

[0,+∞) xd P(B)(x). If B2 = A with A ≥0,
by (9.54) we obtain
	
[0,+∞)
xd P(A)(x) =
	
[0,+∞)
x2d P(B)(x) =
	
[0,+∞)
xd P(B)( f −1(x)) ,

where f (x) = x2, x ≥0, so f −1 : [0, +∞) →[0 + ∞) is a well-deﬁned map.
The spectral measure of A is unique, so in particular P(B)( f −1(E′)) = P(A)(E′) for
any Borel set E′ ⊂[0, +∞). If E ⊂[0, +∞) is a Borel set, f (E) ⊂[0, +∞).
Setting E′ = f (E) gives P(B)(E) = P(A)( f (E)) for any Borel set E ⊂[0, +∞)
(and P(B)(E) = 0 if E ⊂(−∞, 0)). Therefore A determines B completely, for it
determines its unique PVM.

10.3.2
Polar Decomposition Theorem for Closed
and Densely-Deﬁned Operators
We can ﬁnally prove the polar decomposition for closed, densely-deﬁned operators.
The idea of the proof is to start, rather than from A, from A∗A. If the polar decompo-
sition is to hold, one expects A∗A = |A| |A|, with |A| :=
√
A∗A deﬁned spectrally,
remembering A∗A is self-adjoint. Now Theorem 10.37(c) yields the required polar
decomposition of A. The powerfulness of this approach becomes apparent when
considering the properties of the domains involved: usually hard to study by a more
direct method, they are now automatic, by Theorem 10.37.
Theorem 10.39 Let A : D(A) →H be closed and deﬁned densely on the Hilbert
space H.
(a) There exists a unique pair P,U on H such that:
(1) the polar decomposition
A = U P
(10.62)
holds,
(2) P is positive, self-adjoint and D(P) = D(A),
(3) U ∈B(H) is isometric on Ran(P),
(4) Ker(U) ⊃Ker(P).
(b) Moreover:
(i) P = |A| :=
√
A∗A,
(ii) Ker(U) = Ker(P) = Ker(A) = (Ran(P))⊥and Ran(P) = Ran(A∗),
(iii) Ran(U) = Ran(A).
Remark 10.40 The operator U of (10.62) is a partial isometry (Deﬁnition 3.72) with
initial space
[Ker(U)]⊥= Ran(P) = [Ker(A)]⊥= Ran(A∗)
and ﬁnal space
Ran(U) = Ran(A) .
■

Spectral Theory III: Applications
Proof (a) We prove uniqueness by ﬁnding P and U explicitly, assuming (10.62)
plus (2), (3), (4). First we show D(A∗A) = D(P P). By deﬁnition of adjoint, as
U ∈B(H), (10.62) implies A∗= P∗U ∗= PU ∗. Hence f ∈D(A∗A) if and only
if f ∈D(PU ∗U P). Splitting H into Ran(P) ⊕Ker(P∗) = Ran(P) ⊕Ker(P),
and since U is assumed to be isometric on Ran(P) and zero on Ker(P), we get
(U ∗U)↾Ran(P)= I ↾Ran(P). Hence the claim f ∈D(A∗A) ⇔f ∈D(PU ∗U P) is
equivalent to f ∈D(A∗A) ⇔f ∈D(P P). So we have proved D(A∗A) = D(P P).
Let us use it towards uniqueness. If g ∈D(A∗A) ⊂D(A) (i.e. g ∈D(P P) ⊂
D(P)), recalling U is isometric on Ran(P), then
( f |A∗Ag) = (Af |Ag) = (U P f |U Pg) = (P f |Pg) = ( f |P Pg) for f ∈D(A) = D(P).
Being D(A) = D(P) dense, we conclude A∗A = P P. Therefore P is a positive
self-adjoint root of A∗A, hence unique by Theorem 10.38, and P =
√
A∗A =: |A|.
Now we can apply Theorem 10.37 with B = P (closed and densely deﬁned, being
self-adjoint) to ﬁnd that U is uniquely determined and coincides with C satisfying (3)
and (4). We have proved that, if they exist, P and U are uniquely determined by (1)–
(4). Reversing our reasoning, let A be as in the hypothesis, and deﬁne P := |A| and
U := C (see Theorem 10.37, with B = |A| so that A∗A = B∗B). Then requirements
(1), (2) are valid.
(b) We already know that P = |A|. That Ker(U) = Ker(P) = (Ran(P))⊥
follows from Theorem 10.37(b), because B = P = P∗= B∗in our case and
(Ran(P∗))⊥= Ker(P). The claim Ker(A) = Ker(P) goes as follows:
0 = ||Af ||2 = (Af |Af ) = ( f |A∗Af ) = ( f |P P f ) = (P f |P f ) = ||P f ||2 ,
where we used the fact that Af = 0 implies f ∈D(A∗A) by deﬁnition of the
latter. Now Ran(P) = Ran(A∗) follows immediately from the previous prop-
erties: Ran(P) = Ker(P)⊥= Ker(A)⊥= Ran(A∗). In the ﬁnal equality we
used Theorem 5.10(c), as A is closed and the domain of A∗is dense by Theorem
5.10(b). Let us prove Ran(U) = Ran(A). By the decomposition U P = A, taking
Ker(U) = [Ran(P)]⊥into account, we have Ran(U) = U(Ran(P)) = Ran(A),
so Ran(U) = U(Ran(P)) = Ran(A). Then it sufﬁces to show Ran(U) is closed.
Let y ∈Ran(U) \ {0}. There exists {xn}n∈N ⊂(KerU)⊥with Uxn →y,
n →+∞. Since ||U(xn −xm)|| = ||xn −xm||, {xn}n∈N is a Cauchy sequence.
Deﬁne x = limn→+∞xn, so Ux = y, y ∈Ran(U) and then Ran(U) contains its
limit points, i.e. it is closed.
□
Corollary 10.41 In the hypotheses of Theorem 10.39 the operator U : H →H is
unitary precisely when A is injective and Ran(A) is dense in H.
In particular U is unitary and U = A|A|−1 in case A is bijective.
Proof If U is unitary, in particular it is one-to-one and onto, so (ii) and (iii) in
(b) imply A is injective and Ran(A) dense in H. Conversely, if A is injective, by
(a) and (b) in the theorem above and by continuity of U, we have U isometric on

10.3 Polar Decomposition Theorem for Unbounded Operators
581
Ran(|A|) = Ker(|A|)⊥= Ker(A)⊥= H. As Ran(U) = Ran(A) in case Ran(A)
is dense, we conclude U : H →H is isometric and onto, hence unitary as claimed.
If A is further bijective, it is injective and Ran(A) is trivially dense, so U is unitary
as seen before. From A = U|A|, then, A and U being bijective, we obtain |A| is
bijective, so U = A|A|−1, ending the proof.

10.4
The Theorems of Kato–Rellich and Kato
The last results we will state and prove are those of Kato–Rellich and Kato. They are
extremely useful to study self-adjointness and lower boundedness for QM operators
(especially the so-called Hamiltonian operators), in the framework of perturbation
theory. The Kato–Rellich theorem provides sufﬁcient conditions for an operator of
the form T + V , called a perturbation of T , to be self-adjoint, and have lower-
bounded spectrum when T has. Kato’s theorem considers speciﬁc situations, where
T is the Laplacian on R3 or Rn. A general treatise, with applications to quantum
physics, is [ReSi80], from which several proofs of this section are taken.
10.4.1
The Kato–Rellich Theorem
A preliminary deﬁnition is in order.
Deﬁnition 10.42 Let T : D(T ) →H and V : D(V ) →H be densely-deﬁned
operators on the Hilbert space H, with D(T ) ⊂D(V ). If there are a, b ∈[0, +∞)
such that
||V ϕ|| ≤a||T ϕ|| + b||ϕ|| for any ϕ ∈D(T ) ,
(10.63)
V is called T-bounded. The greatest lower bound of the numbers a satisfying (10.63)
for some b is called the relative bound of V with respect to T . If the relative bound
is zero, V is called inﬁnitesimally small with respect to T .
Remark 10.43
(1) If T and V are closable, by Deﬁnition 5.20 it sufﬁces to verify (10.63) over a
core of T .
(2) Equation (10.63) is equivalent to:
||V ϕ||2 ≤a2
1||T ϕ||2 + b2
1||ϕ||2
for any ϕ ∈D(T ) ,
(10.64)
In fact, (10.64) implies (10.63) by putting a = a1, b = b1. For the converse, take
a2
1 = (1 + δ)a2, b2
1 = (1 + 1/δ)b2 for any δ > 0: then (10.63) implies (10.64).
(The greatest lower bound of the numbers a1 satisfying (10.64) for some b1 is also

582
10
Spectral Theory III: Applications
called the relative bound of V with respect to T . Due to the arbitrariness of δ > 0,
it coincides with the relative bound computed using (10.63).)
■
Let us pass to the Kato–Rellich theorem. For a self-adjoint operator A : D(A) →H,
we know σ(A) ⊂[M, +∞) ⇔(ψ|Aψ) ≥M(ψ|ψ) for any ψ ∈D(A), by Theorem
10.38(a). Therefore statement (c) below may be equivalently expressed in terms of
lower-bounded quadratic forms.
Theorem 10.44 (Kato–Rellich) Let T : D(T ) →H and V : D(V ) →H be
densely-deﬁned operators on the Hilbert space H such that:
(i) T is self-adjoint,
(ii) V is symmetric,
(iii) V is T -bounded with relative bound a < 1.
Then
(a) T + V is self-adjoint on D(T ).
(b) T + V is essentially self-adjoint on every core of T .
(c) If σ(T ) ⊂[M, +∞) then σ(T + V ) ⊂[M′, +∞) where:
M′ = M −max

b
(1 −a), a|M| + b

,
with a, b satisfying (10.63).
Proof For (a) we try to apply Theorem 5.18, showing that if we choose D(T ) as
domain for the symmetric operator T +V , we obtain Ran(T +V ±i I) = H. Actually
we will prove there exists ν > 0 such that
Ran(T + V ± iνI) = H ,
givingthepreviousrelationbylinearity.Ifϕ ∈D(T ), T self-adjointimplies Ran(T +
iμI) = H and
||(T + iμI)ϕ||2 = ||T ϕ||2 + μ2||ϕ||2 .
Setting ϕ = (T + iμI)−1ψ, gives
||T (T + iμI)−1|| ≤1 and ||(T + iμI)−1|| ≤μ−1 .
Applying (10.63) with ϕ = (T + iμI)−1ψ produces
||V (T +iμI)−1ψ|| ≤a||T (T +iμI)−1ψ||+b||(T +iμI)−1ψ|| ≤

a + b

||ψ||.
If μ = ν is large enough, the bounded operator
U := V (T + iνI)−1 ,

10.4 The Theorems of Kato–Rellich and Kato
583
deﬁned on H, satisﬁes ||U|| < 1, as a < 1. This implies −1 /∈σ(U) by (iii) in
Theorem 8.4(c). By Theorem 8.4(a) (U is closed as bounded), we have Ran(I +U) =
H. At the same time, since T is self-adjoint, Ran(T + iνI) = H by Theorem 5.18.
Hence
(I + U)(T + iνI)ϕ = (T + V + iνI)ϕ ,
ϕ ∈D(T )
implies, as claimed, Ran(T + V +iνI) = H. The proof of Ran(T + V −iνI) = H
is completely similar, so (a) is proved.
Let us pass to (b). Equation (10.63) implies, if D ⊂D(T ) is a core for T :
D(T ) = D

T↾D

⊂D

(T + V )↾D

.
On the other hand, by construction and because T + V is self-adjoint on D(T) hence
closed:
D

(T + V )↾D

⊂D

(T + V )

= D (T + V ) = D(T ) .
Putting

produces
D

(T + V )↾D

= D (T + V )
so
(T + V )↾D = T + V , as T + V is closed. Then (T + V )↾D is essentially self-
adjoint by Proposition 5.21.
Now (c). By assumption, the spectral theorem implies σ(T ) ≥M (with obvious
notation). Choosing s > −M (with s ∈R) gives σ(T + sI) > 0, so 0 /∈σ(T + sI).
But T + sI is self-adjoint, so it is closed, and by Theorem 8.4(a) Ran(T +sI) = H.
The same estimates used before prove ||V (T + sI)−1|| < 1 if
−s < M′ := M −max

b
(1 −a), a|M| + b

.
Consequently, for these s:
Ran(T + V + sI) = H and (T + V + sI)−1 = (T + sI)−1(I + U)−1 ,
implying −s ∈ρ(T + V ), and then −s /∈σ(T + V ). But T + V self-adjoint has
real spectrum, whence σ(T + V ) ≥M′.

An Example: The Operator −Δ + V and Kato’s
Theorem
Condition (10.63) arises naturally in certain contexts, and is of great use, in physical
applications, to study the Schrödinger equation, where the Laplace operator Δ is
perturbed by a potential V . To discuss this application of the Kato–Rellich theorem
we begin with a proposition and a lemma.

Proposition 10.45 Let

be the Laplace operator on Rn thought of as operator on (suitable domains of)
L2(Rn, dx).
(a) If -
F : L2(Rn, dx) →L2(Rn, dk) is the unitary Fourier–Plancherel operator
(cf. Sect.3.7), then Δ is essentially self-adjoint on S (Rn), on D(Rn) and on
-
F(D(Rn)) with the same (unique) self-adjoint extension Δ.

(c) The operator −Δ = −Δ is bounded from below:
σ(−Δ) ⊂[0, +∞) ,
or equivalently (ψ|−Δψ) ≥0 for any ψ ∈D(−Δ).
(10.67)
Proof Most of (a) and (b) were proven in Exercises 5.13, 5.14. What we still do not
have is that Δ is essentially self-adjoint on -
F(D(Rn)) and has a common self-adjoint
extension over both D(Rn) and S (Rn). To this end notice -
F(D(Rn)), D(Rn) ⊂
S (Rn), so the three extensions coincide because there is one self-adjoint extension to
any essentially self-adjoint operator. That Δ is essentially self-adjoint on -
F(D(Rn)),
given -
F is unitary and (10.66), is equivalent to the essential self-adjointness of the
symmetric multiplication by −k2 on D(Rn). In turn the latter, in view of Nelson’s
Theorem 5.47, follows from the observation that every ϕ = ϕ(k) in D(Rn) is analytic
for the multiplication by −k2, since ||−(k2)nϕ|| ≤||ϕ||(supk∈suppϕ |k|2)n. Statement
(c) descends from (b) and from Theorem 10.38(a).
□
Now a fundamental, classical result.
Lemma 10.46 Fix n = 1, 2, 3 and consider f ∈D(Δ). Then f coincides almost
everywhere with a continuous bounded map, and for any a > 0 there exists b > 0
independent from f such that:
|| f ||∞≤a||Δ f || + b|| f || .
(10.68)
Proof Let us prove (10.68) for n = 3, the other cases being similar. Call ˆf := -
F f .
By Proposition 3.105(a) and Plancherel’s theorem (Theorem 3.108), the claim is true

10.4 The Theorems of Kato–Rellich and Kato
585
if we manage to prove ˆf ∈L1(R3, dk), and for any given a > 0 there is b ∈R such
that:
|| ˆf ||1 ≤a||k2 ˆf ||2 + b|| ˆf ||2 .
(10.69)
If f ∈D(Δ), by Proposition 10.45,
ˆf ∈D( -
FΔ -
F −1), so also (1 + k2) ˆf ∈
L2(R3, dk). Since (k1, k2, k3) →1/(1 + k2) belongs to that same space,
ˆf ∈
L1(R3, dk) by the Hölder inequality. Moreover:
|| ˆf ||1 ≤c||(1 + k2) ˆf ||2 ≤c(||k2 ˆf ||2 + || ˆf ||2)
(10.70)
where c :=

(1 + k2)−1dk. If r > 0 deﬁne ˆfr(k) := r3 ˆf (rk). Then || ˆfr||1 =
|| ˆf ||1, || ˆfr||2 = r3/2|| ˆf ||2 and ||k2 ˆfr||2 = r−1/2||k2 ˆf ||2. Using (10.70) for ˆfr the
three previous identities give
|| ˆf ||1 ≤cr−1/2||k2 ˆf ||2 + cr3/2|| ˆf ||2
for any r > 0.
Then (10.69) holds for a = cr−1/2.
□
Remark 10.47 The lemma can be generalised (see [ReSi80, vol. II]) bythis statement
based on Young’s inequality: Consider f ∈L2(Rn, dx) with f ∈D(Δ). If n ≥4
and 2 ≤q < 2n/(n −4) then f ∈Lq(Rn, dk), and for any a > 0 there exists b ∈R
not depending on f (but on q, n, a) such that || f ||q ≤a||Δ f || + b|| f ||.
■
We can eventually apply the Kato–Rellich theorem to a very interesting case for
Quantum Mechanics, and prove a result due to Kato. Later we will see a more
general statement, known in the literature as Kato’s theorem.
Theorem 10.48 (Essential self-adjointness of −Δ + V ) Fix n = 1, 2, 3 and take
V = V2 + V∞, with V2 ∈L2(Rn, dx), V∞∈L∞(Rn, dx) real functions.
(a) −Δ + V is essentially self-adjoint on D(Rn) and on S (Rn).
(b) The only self-adjoint extension −Δ + V of the operators of (a) coincides with
the (self-adjoint) operator −Δ + V deﬁned on D(Δ).
(c) σ(−Δ + V ) is bounded from below.
Proof As V is real it gives a multiplicative operator on the domain
D(V ) := {ϕ ∈L2(Rn, dx) | V ϕ ∈L2(Rn, dx)} .
Using the deﬁnition it is easy to see the operator is self-adjoint. By construction,
moreover,
||V ϕ||2 ≤||V2||2||ϕ||∞+ ||V∞||∞||ϕ||2 < +∞
(10.71)
for ϕ ∈D(Rn) or ϕ ∈S (Rn). Hence D(Rn) ⊂S (Rn) ⊂D(V ). What is more,
since S (Rn) ⊂D(Δ) (by Proposition 10.45), using (10.68) in Lemma 10.46 (n ≤3)
we ﬁnd, for any a > 0, a number b > 0 such that:

586
10
Spectral Theory III: Applications
||V ϕ||2 ≤a||V2||2 || −Δϕ||2 + (b + ||V∞||∞)||ϕ||2
for any ϕ ∈S (Rn) .
That is to say: given a′ > 0 there is b′ > 0 with
||V ϕ||2 ≤a′|| −Δϕ||2 + b′||ϕ||2
for any ϕ ∈S (Rn)
(10.72)
so in particular for any ϕ ∈D(Rn). Consequently
||V ϕ −V ϕ′||2 ≤a′ ||(−Δϕ) −(−Δϕ′)||2 + b′||ϕ −ϕ′||2
with ϕ, ϕ′ in S (Rn). Now, V is closed, as self-adjoint, and S (Rn) is a core for
the self-adjoint (hence closed) operator −Δ (by Proposition 10.45), so the inequality
proves D(V ) ⊃D(−Δ).Exploitingtheclosureofoperatorsweconcludethat(10.72)
holds on the entire domain of −Δ:
||V ϕ||2 ≤a′||−Δϕ||2 + b′||ϕ||2
for any ϕ ∈D(−Δ).
If we choose a′ < 1, T := −Δ satisﬁes the assumptions of Theorem 10.44, with V
as we have it now. By Kato–Rellich, using that S (Rn) and D(Rn) are cores for −Δ
by Proposition 10.45, we conclude.
□
Remark 10.49 Remembering Remark 10.47, this theorem generalises to n > 3 with
these modiﬁcations: V = Vp + V∞with Vp ∈L p(Rn, dx), V∞∈L∞(Rn, dx),
where p > 2 for n = 4, p = n/2 for n ≥5. The proof is analogous.

Theorem 10.50 (Kato) Fix n = 1, 2, 3 and denote by (y1, . . . , yN) the elements in
RnN, where yk ∈Rn for any k = 1, . . . , N. If Δ is the Laplacian (10.65) on RnN,

are real functions. Then
(a) −Δ + V is essentially self-adjoint on D(RnN) and S (RnN).
(b) The only self-adjoint extension −Δ + V of the operators in (a) coincides with
the (self-adjoint) operator −Δ + V deﬁned on D(−Δ).
(c) σ(−Δ + V ) is lower bounded.

10.4 The Theorems of Kato–Rellich and Kato
587
Proof We prove for n = 3, for the other cases are identical. Consider the potential
V12(y1 −y2) and call Δ1 the Laplacian corresponding to the coordinates of y1.
Take ϕ ∈S (R3N). Fix y2, . . . yN ∈R3(N−1) and deﬁne R3 ∋y1 →ϕ′(y1) :=
ϕ(y1, y2, . . . , yN). Then ϕ′ belongs in D(R3N) or S (R3N), according to whether
ϕ ∈D(R3N) or ϕ ∈S (R3N) respectively. Similarly, let R3 ∋y1 →V ′
12(y1) :=
V12(y1 −y2). As in the previous proof, by decomposing V12 = (V12)2 + (V12)∞we
arrive at the estimate, for any a > 0 and any y2, . . . , yN:
||V ′
12ϕ′||L2(R3) ≤a||(V12)2||L2(R3) || −Δ1ϕ′||L2(R3) + (b + ||(V12)∞||L∞(R3))||ϕ′||2
where b > 0 depends on a, not on y2, . . . yN ∈R3(N−1). Norms are in the spaces
over the ﬁrst copy of R3 in R3N. It is important to note, due to the invariance of
(y1, y2) →V12(y1 −y2) under translations, that the norms ||(V12)k||Lk(R3) do not
depend on the variable y2. From Remark 10.43 this inequality is the same as
||V ′
12ϕ′||2
L2(R3) ≤a′ || −Δ1ϕ′||2
L2(R3) + b′||ϕ′||2
L2(R3)
for certain a′, b′ > 0 with a′ arbitrarily small because of a||V12||2. Integrating the
inequality in the variables y2, . . . yN ∈R3(N−1) produces, for any a′ > 0, a corre-
sponding b′ > 0 such that
||V12ϕ||2
L2(R3N ) ≤a′ || −Δ1ϕ||2
L2(R3N ) + b′||ϕ||2
L2(R3N ) .
(10.74)

From this point onwards the proof picks up from Eq.(10.72) in the proof of Theorem
10.48, replacing Rn with R3N.
□
In conclusion we mention, without full proof, another important result of Kato. The
demands on V to have −Δ + V essentially self-adjoint on D(Rn) are different (and
weaker than Theorem 10.48 if n = 3). Recall that f : Rn →C is called locally
square-integrable if f · g is in L2(Rn, dx) for every g ∈D(Rn).
Theorem 10.51 The operator −Δ + VΔ + VC deﬁned on L2(Rn, dx) is essen-
tially self-adjoint on D(Rn), and its unique self-adjoint extension −Δ + VΔ + VC
is bounded from below, provided the following conditions hold.
(i) VΔ : Rn →R is measurable and induces a (−Δ)-bounded multiplicative oper-
ator with relative bound a < 1 (cf. Deﬁnition 10.42).
(ii) VC : Rn →R is locally square-integrable with VC ≥C almost everywhere, for
some C ∈R.
Part (i) holds if
VΔ ∈L p(Rn, dx) + L∞(Rn, dx) ,
with p = 2 when n ≤3, p > 2 when n = 4 and p = n/2 when n ≥5.
Sketch of proof. The ﬁnal statement was proved with Theorem 10.48 if n ≤3. The
argument is the same for n > 4 by the remark ensuing Lemma 10.46. If (i) holds
−Δ+VΔ is essentially self-adjoint on D(Rn) and −Δ + VΔ is lower bounded by the
Kato–Rellich theorem. If (ii) holds as well, −Δ + VΔ + (VC −C) is essentially self-
adjoint on D(Rn) by [ReSi80, vol.II, Theorem X.29], for Vc −C ≥0. Therefore
−Δ + VΔ + VC = (−Δ + VΔ + (VC −C)) + C I is essentially self-adjoint on
D(Rn). Since −Δ + VΔ and VC are both bounded from below on that domain, so
are −Δ + VΔ + VC and −Δ + VΔ + VC.
□

10.4 The Theorems of Kato–Rellich and Kato
589
Example 10.52
(1) A case in R3 that is interesting to physics is one where the Laplacian perturbation
V is the attractive Coulomb potential:
V (x) = eQ
|x| ,
with e < 0, Q > 0 constants, |x| :=

x2
1 + x2
2 + x2
3. The hypotheses of Kato’s
Theorem 10.50 (or 10.48) are valid for the operator:
H0 := −ℏ2
2m Δ + V (x)
(the constants m, ℏ> 0 are irrelevant to the previous theorem, since we may multiply
the operator by 2m/ℏ2 and then apply it, without losing in generality). So H0 is
essentially self-adjoint if deﬁned on D(R3) or S (R3). The self-adjoint extension
H0, if Q = −e, corresponds to the Hamiltonian operator of an electron in the
electric ﬁeld of a proton (neglecting spin effects and viewing the proton as a classical
object). This gives the simplest quantum description of the Hamiltonian operator of
the hydrogen atom. Here −e is the common absolute value of the charge of electron
and proton, m is the electronic mass, ℏ> 0 is Planck’s constant divided by 2π.
The spectrum of the unique self-adjoint extension of this operator determines, in
physics, the admissible values of the energy of the system. Despite V is not bounded
from below, it is important that the spectrum of the operator considered is always
bounded, and therefore also the energy values that are physically admissible have
a lower bound. In Chaps.11, 12 and 13 we will examine better the meaning of the
operators here brieﬂy described.
(2) A second case of physical interest, always in R3, is given by the Yukawa potential:
V (x) = −e−μ|x|
|x|
,
where μ > 0 is another positive number. Here, too, the operator H0 = −ℏ2
2m Δ+V (x)
is essentially self-adjoint if deﬁned on D(R3) or on S (R3), as we know from Kato’s
Theorem 10.50 (or 10.48). The Yukawa potential describes, roughly, interactions
between a pion and a source of the strong force, the latter thought of, in this manner
of speaking, as being caused by a macroscopic source.
(3) The third physically-relevant case is the Hamiltonian of a system of N particles
that interact under an external Coulomb potential and the Coulomb potentials of
all pairs (not necessarily attractive). Call xi ∈R3 the position vectors, mi > 0 the
masses and ei ∈R \ {0} the charges (i = 1, . . . , N). The full operator is

V (y1, . . . , yN) satisﬁes Kato’s Theorem 10.50, so H0 is essentially self-adjoint on
D(R3N) and its unique self-adjoint extension is bounded from below.
(4) Theorem 10.51 allows to say the following. Adding any real function V ′, locally
integrable and bounded from below, to the Hamiltonian operators H0 seen in the
previous examples gives an essentially self-adjoint operator on the corresponding
D(Rn). An important instance is the harmonic potential (non-isotropic, in general)
V ′(x) = kx2

10.2. Take n = 2, the generalisation being similar. If A1 = 0 or A2 = 0 the claim
is obvious, so assume ||A1||, ||A2|| > 0. When solving (2) we found ||A1 ⊗A2|| ≤
||A1|| ||A2||, so it is enough to obtain the opposite inequality. By deﬁnition of ||A1||

||ψ||=1
||A1 ⊗A2ψ|| ≥||(A1 ⊗A2)(ψ(ε)

for any ε > 0 we have ||A1 ⊗A2|| ≥||A1|| ||A2|| −ε(||A1|| + ||A2||) + ε2,
where −ε(||A1|| + ||A2||) + ε2 < 0. That value tends to 0 as ε →0+. Eventually,
||A1 ⊗A2|| ≥||A1|| ||A2|| as required.

10.6 Suppose that A : D(A) →H is a closed, densely deﬁned, normal operator
(A∗A = AA∗). Prove that D(A) = D(A∗).
Solution. Since A∗A = AA∗can be written A∗A = (A∗)∗A∗, Theorem 10.37(c)
implies D(A) = D(A∗).
10.7 Suppose that A : D(A) →H is a closed, densely deﬁned, normal operator
(A∗A = AA∗). Referring to the polar decompositions A = U P and A∗= V S, show
the following facts hold
(i) V = U ∗and S = P,
(ii) U is normal,
(iii) U A ⊂AU, U ∗A ⊂AU ∗, U P ⊂PU, U ∗P ⊂PU ∗, AP ⊂P A, A∗P ⊂
P A∗.

Spectral Theory III: Applications
Solution. Start from U P PU ∗= AA∗= A∗A = PU ∗U P. Since U ∗U|Ran(P) =
I|Ran(P), we have U P2U ∗= P2 and so P2U ∗= U ∗P2. Therefore U ∗commutes
with the PVM of P2, and hence with every function of it, in particular P =
√
P2:
U ∗P ⊂PU ∗. Taking the adjoint we also have U P ⊂PU. Taking the adjoint
of both sides of A = U P we get A∗= PU ∗, and then A∗x = U ∗Px provided
x ∈D(P). However D(P) = D(A∗) because D(P) = D(A) = D(A∗) (Theorem
10.37), so that A∗= U ∗P. Now, notice that U ∗is an isometry on Ran(P) because
U is an isometry on Ran(U) and (U ∗Px|U ∗Px) = (x|PUU ∗Px) = (x|AA∗x) =
(x|A∗Ax) = (x|PU ∗U Px) = (x|P Px) = (Px|Px). A similar argument proves
that (Px|(U ∗U −UU ∗)Px) = 0. Actually, since Ker(P) ⊥Ran(P), Ker(P) ⊕
Ran(P) = H and ﬁnally U(Ker(P)) ⊂Ker(P) and U ∗(Ker(P)) ⊂Ker(P) (for
U and U ∗commute with P), then (Px|(U ∗U −UU ∗)Px) = 0 can be extended
to (y|(U ∗U −UU ∗)y) = 0 for every y ∈H. We conclude that UU ∗= U ∗U as
requested, but also Ker(U ∗) = Ker(U). The latter contains Ker(P) by hypothesis,
so Ker(U) ⊃Ker(P). In summary, A∗= U ∗P satisﬁes all requirements deﬁning
the polar decomposition of A∗. Uniqueness concludes the proof of the fact that A∗=
U ∗P is the polar decomposition of A∗. Finally observe that, since U commutes with
P, we have U A = UU P ⊂U PU = AU. A similar argument proves U A∗⊂A∗U.
Regarding the last inclusions: AP = U P P ⊂PU P = P A and A∗P = U ∗P P ⊂
PU ∗P = P A∗.
10.8 Suppose that A : D(A) →H is a closed, densely deﬁned, self-adjoint (or
anti-self-adjoint) operator and assume that Ker(A) = {0}. Referring to the polar
decomposition A = U P prove that U = U ∗= U −1 (respectively, U = −U ∗=
U −1).
Hint. Use the spectral decomposition theorem.
10.9 Study the polar decomposition A = U P for the operator A of Sect.9.1.4. Prove
that U satisﬁes
Uψn = ψn−1
if n ≥1 and {ψn}n∈N is the basis of L2(R, dx) deﬁned in Sect.9.1.4.

∗= V P1 for the operator A of Sect.9.1.4.
Prove that V satisﬁes
V ψn = ψn+1
if n ≥0 and {ψn}n∈N is the basis of L2(R, dx) deﬁned in Sect.9.1.4.
10.11 Referring to Exercises (10.9) and (10.10), prove that
P =

N
and
P1 =
√
N + I
where N is the unique self-adjoint extension of the symmetric operator deﬁned
on the ﬁnite span of the Hilbert basis {ψn}n∈N, introduced in Sect.9.1.4, such that
Nψn = nψ for n ∈N.

10.12 Consider the operator A of Sect.9.1.4 and prove that σp(A∗) = σc(A∗) = ∅
and σr(A∗) = C.
Solution. We already know from Exercise 9.8 that σp(A) = C, while Exercises
10.10 and 10.11 tell us that A∗= V √N + 1. Consider ψ ∈H such that A∗ψ = λψ
for some λ ∈C. Since √N + 1 is invertible, this equation is equivalent to V φ =

−1φ where both V and √N + 1
−1 are bounded and everywhere deﬁned.

n |cn|2 = +∞, and we conclude ψ cannot exist. We have proved that σp(A∗) = ∅.
Next observe that, as A is closed and the domain of A∗= A
∗is dense, Theorem
5.10(c) implies Ran(A∗−λI)⊥= Ker(A−λI)̸={0} (the last inequality was proved
in Exercise 9.8). Hence Ran(A∗−λI) cannot be dense for every λ ∈C, and therefore
σr(A∗) = C because A∗−λI is injective for every λ ∈C, as we proved above.
10.13 Prove the statement in Remark 10.43(2).

Chapter 11
Mathematical Formulation
of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
Every science would be redundant if the essence of things and
their phenomenic appearance coincided.
Karl Marx
In this chapter we shall mainly enucleate the axioms of QM for the elementary system
made by a non-relativistic spinless particle, and discuss a series of important results
related to the canonical commutation relations (CCRs).
In section one we will revisit, especially in the light of spectral theory, the four
axioms of Chap.7. We will introduce the von Neumann algebra of observables and
complete sets of commuting observables.
Section two further develops the notion of superselection rules, and presents a
few new technical results in relation with von Neumann algebras.
Section three deals with several technical facts, of physical relevance, about the
notion of observable viewed as a self-adjoint operator.
Then, in section four, we will add an axiom for the formalisation of the quantum
theory of the spin-zero particle. We shall introduce the CCRs and prove they cannot be
satisﬁed by bounded operators. We will show how Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
is actually a theorem in the formulation.
The penultimate section is dedicated to the famous theorem of Stone–von Neu-
mann, later reﬁned by Mackey, which characterises continuous unitary representa-
tions of the CCRs. To prove the theorem we will introduce Weyl ∗-algebras and
discuss their main properties. After proving the theorems of Stone–von Neumann
and Mackey, we will use the formalism to extend Heisenberg’s relations under rather
weak hypotheses on the states involved, and then generalise them to mixtures. We
shall reformulate the results of Stone–von Neumann and Mackey in terms of the
Heisenberg group. A short description of Dirac’s correspondence principle and its
relationship to the procedure called deformation quantisation closes the chapter.

Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
11.1
Round-up and Further Discussion on Axioms A1, A2,
A3, A4
In Chap.7 we saw the general axioms of QM. Let us summarise part of that chapter
in the light of the spectral theory developed subsequently. We focus in particular on
axiom A4, the notion of observable and superselection rules, to which we can add
further theoretical material.
11.1.1
Axioms A1, A2, A3
A1. Given a quantum system S described in an (inertial) frame system I , exper-
imentally testable propositions on S at any given time correspond bijectively to
(a sublattice, at least in presence of superselection rules, of) the lattice L (HS) of
orthogonal projectors of a complex separable Hilbert space HS ̸= {0}, respectively
called the logic of elementary propositions of S and the Hilbert space associated
to S. Moreover (using the same letter for propositions and corresponding projectors):
(1)thecompatibilityoftwopropositions(frommeasuringprocessesattributingsimul-
taneous truth values to both) corresponds to the commutation of the orthogonal pro-
jectors;
(2) the logical implication of two compatible propositions P ⇒Q corresponds to
the projectors’ relation P ≤Q;
(3) I (identity operator) and 0 (null operator) correspond to the tautology and the
contradiction;
(4) the negation ⊣P of P corresponds to the orthogonal projector ¬P = I −P;
(5) the propositions P O Q and P E Q have a physical meaning only when P, Q are
compatible, and correspond to the orthogonal projectors P ∨Q and P ∧Q (respec-
tively projecting onto the closure of the union and the intersection of the projection
spaces of P, Q);
(6) if {Qn}n∈N is a countable collection of pairwise-compatible propositions, the
propositions corresponding to ∨n∈NQn and ∧n∈NQn are physically meaningful.
In the sequel we shall assume, loosely speaking, that all the elements in the logic
L (HS) describe elementary propositions on S. Different choices, especially in pres-
ence of superselection rules but not only, will be discussed separately.
Remarks 11.1 (1) The Hilbert space HS actually depends on the frame system I
as well, as explained in Remark7.23(4). Another system will give an isomorphic
Hilbert space. We will return to this in Chap.13.
(2) The fact that HS is separable turns out to be useful in several technical construc-
tions. For elementary non-relativistic systems HS is automatically separable, as we
shall see in this chapter. We will also explain that the Hilbert space of a system made
of a ﬁnite number of elementary systems is, in turn, separable as it is described as

a ﬁnite tensor product of separable spaces. As for quantum ﬁelds, their the Hilbert
space is the Fock space, again separable. However, if we stick to the Hilbert space
description of quantum systems where states are trace-class operators, there is at
least one physical reason to assume that the Hilbert space of a physical system is
separable, and the argument is purely thermodynamical. Thermodynamical states
of a system in equilibrium with a thermostat, or in equilibrium with other thermo-
dynamical systems, are represented quantistically by mixed states (see axiom A2
below) of the form Zβe−βH where Zβ := tr(e−βH). Here H is the Hamiltonian of
the system, β := 1/(kBT ) where T is the absolute temperature, and kB is Boltz-
mann’s constant (the case of an open system can be studied similarly by introducing
chemical potentials). In this situation e−βH must obviously be of trace-class so, in
particular, e−βH, and hence H itself, must have purely point spectrum (up to perhaps
the value 0 ∈σc(e−βH)). It should be clear that if HS were not separable, the trace-
class operator e−βH would not exist, because it would have an uncountable set of
orthonormal eigenvectors with strictly positive eigenvalue, giving rise to a divergent
trace.
When the setup seems to lead inevitably to a non-separable scenario or, more
generally, if the description of trace-class states generates insurmountable problems,
a more interesting possibility is to abandon Hilbert spaces completely. One radically
different line of action describes the system by the so-called algebraic approach,
which we will introduce in the last chapter. With this approach it does not matter
whether the Hilbert space representations are separable or not. When one deals with
extended thermodynamical systems, where the notion of state in terms of trace-class
operator cannot be used, it is much better to rely on algebraic states (which we
shall address in Chap.14) and the celebrated KMS condition in order to characterise
algebraic thermodynamical states [Haa96].
■
A2. A state ρ at time t on a quantum system S, with associated Hilbert space HS, is
a positive, trace-class operator on HS with trace one.
The probability that the proposition P ∈L (HS) on ρ is true equals tr(ρP).
If, as we said, we suppose elementary propositions are described by the whole
logic L (HS), states ρ are convex combinations (also inﬁnite, if we consider spectral
decompositions of states) of extreme states in the convex set S(HS) of states. Extreme
statesarecalledpureandhavetheformρ = ψ(ψ|)forsomeunitvector ψ ∈HS. The
space of pure states is denoted by Sp(HS) and is in one-to-one correspondence with
the (projective) space of rays of HS, i.e. the quotient of HS \ {0} by the equivalence
relation φ ∼φ′ ⇔φ = aφ′ for some a ∈C \ {0}. States that are not pure are
called mixed states or mixtures, and the corresponding trace-class operators are
often called statistical operators or density matrices in the literature. The convex
decomposition of a mixed state in terms of pure states, arising for instance from
the spectral theorem, is called incoherent superposition of pure states. There are,
typically, several convex decompositions into pure states for a single mixed state.
An important notion in physics, also historically speaking, is the transition (or
probability) amplitude (ψ|φ) of the pure state determined by the unit vector φ on
the pure state determined by the unit vector ψ. The square modulus of the transition

598
11
Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
amplitude represents the probability that the system in state φ passes to state ψ after
a measurement. Note that we may swap states, by the symmetry of Hermitian inner
products, without changing the transition probability.
A3. If the quantum system S is in state ρ ∈S(HS) at time t and proposition P ∈
L (HS) is validated by a measurement taken at the same t, the system’s immediate
post-measurement state is
ρP:= PρP
tr(ρP) ,
in accordance with the Lüders-von Neumann collapse postulate. In particular if ρ
is pure and given by ψ ∈HS, ||ψ|| = 1, the post-measurement state is still pure,
and given by the vector
ψP =
Pψ
||Pψ||.
We emphasise that this axiom refers to ideal ﬁrst-kind measurements, or non-
destructive or indirect, as they are known; a lab’s practice adopts several types of
testing, that in general do not obey the axiom.
Remark 11.2 States can alternatively be described in terms of σ-additive prob-
ability measures on L (HS). However only for dim HS ̸= 2 is the correspon-
dence between states and measures one-to-one, in view of the celebrated Gleason
Theorem7.26. We have two alternative formulations of A2 and A3, respectively
denoted by A2 (measure-theory version) and A3 (measure-theory version) and
stated in Sects.7.4.1 and7.4.4. With the reformulation axiom A3 turns out to have
a very natural interpretation in terms of conditional probability, as established in
Proposition7.40: if the state before the measurement of P is represented by the
probability measure μ over L (HS) and P turns out to be true, the probability mea-
sure μP after the measurement is the only probability measure over L (HS) satisfying
μP(Q) = μ(Q)/μ(P) if L (HS) ∋Q ≤P.

A4 Revisited: von Neumann Algebra of Observables
The subsequent axiom, introduced in Chap.7, is concerned with the observables of
a quantum system.
A4. Every observable A of the quantum system S is described by a projector-valued
measure P(A) on R, on the system’s Hilbert space HS, so that the projector P(A)(E)
corresponds to the proposition “the outcome of measuring A falls in E”, for any
Borel set E in R.
The spectral theorem for unbounded self-adjoint operators, proved in its maximal
generality in Chap.9 (Theorem9.13), allows to associate to any observable a unique
self-adjoint operator on the Hilbert space of the physical system. With this, if HS
is the Hilbert space of some system, the spectrum σ(A) ⊂R of an observable A,
i.e. of a self-adjoint operator A : D(A) →HS, contains all possible outcomes of

a measurement of the observable A, theoretically viewed as Borel subsets of σ(A),
especially intervals (a0−δ, a0+δ). Mathematically, σ(A) coincides with the support
of the PVM P(A) associated to the observable. From the spectral theorem we also
easily have that
||A|| = sup{|a| | a ∈σ(A)} .
This subsumes also the case A unbounded, or equivalently D(A) ⊊HS, correspond-
ing to the (formally incorrect) value ||A|| = +∞. As a consequence, observables
may be unbounded self-adjoint operators A, simply because the possible (experi-
mental) values of A belong to an unbounded set σ(A) of real numbers.
Remark 11.3 If a measurement process regards an observable A with σ(A) = σp(A)
and the elements of the spectrum are isolated points, it is always possible to assume
the existence of a measuring instrument whose sensitivity δ > 0 is smaller than the
distance between (ﬁnitely many) consecutive values of A. In this way, even if the
measurement is affected by an experimental error represented by δ > 0, we can
distinguish between couples of eigenvalues, and the Lüders-von Neumann axiom
A3 takes the more familiar and standard form presented in elementary formulations,
i.e. when the associated eigenspaces have dimension 1: after a measurement with
outcome a0 the state is represented by the a0-eigenvector. More generally, the same
result is achieved by measuring simultaneously a ﬁnite set of mutually-compatible
observables whose common eigenspaces have dimension 1 (see the discussion after
Deﬁnition11.11 below). The case of a continuous spectrum, and in particular the
precise form of the post-measurement state, is much more problematic, and it was
analysed by several authors. Ozawa [Oza84, Oza85], using a natural theoretical
description of the measurement procedure, established that the measurements of
continuous-spectrum observables are not repeatable. Also for this reason, the postu-
late by Lüders and von Neumann is viewed with suspicion in presence of continuous
spectrum, and a more accurate description of the quantum measurement process
might be given in terms of quantum operations, POVMs and the related measuring
operators, see Sect.13.2.2.
■
Sticking for the moment to bounded observables, a theoretical tool of great relevance
is the so-called von Neumann algebra of observables of S, henceforth denoted by
RS. It is the von Neumann algebra generated (in the sense of Deﬁnition3.92) by
the set all of bounded observables. Thus the self-adjoint elements of RS represent
all possible bounded observables of the physical system S. A fundamental physical
issue is to determine RS for a given physical system S. The problem can be traced
back to the analogous issue of selecting the lattice of elementary propositions of the
system. The assumption that the elementary propositions on S are described by all the
projectors in L (HS) is questionable, and anyway incompatible with superselection
rules (see below). Generally speaking, one could ask less, like having elementary
propositions described by the sublattice LRS(HS) of orthogonal projectors of the
von Neumann algebra RS (still called the logic of elementary propositions of S).
By Proposition7.61
RS = LRS(HS)′′ ,

600
11
Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
so that, in turn, the elementary propositions of the system completely ﬁx the von
Neumann algebra of observables of the system. Rather relevantly, the centre of the
logic generates the centre of the algebra of observables LRS(HS) ∩LRS(HS)′,
(LRS(HS) ∩LRS(HS)′)′′ = RS ∩R′
S
as established in Theorem7.61.
In absence of superselection rules it is usually assumed, and we are indeed doing
this in discussing axioms A1–A4, that LRS(HS) = L (HS). Then
RS = B(HS) ,
so that R′
S = {cI}c∈C and LRS(HS)∩LRS(HS)′ = {0, I} (the lattice is irreducible).
This, though, is not the general case.
JustlikethelatticeL (HS)ofallorthogonalprojectorsontoHS,thelogicLRS(HS)
is an orthomodular (hence bounded and orthocomplemented), complete lattice which
is separable if, as we assume, HS is separable (Proposition7.61). The remaining
properties of L (HS) listed in Theorem7.56 (atomicity and atomisticity, the covering
property, irreducibility) are not valid in general. We will come back to these issues
when we address superselection rules.
Remark 11.4 If RS is a proper subalgebra of B(HS) the notion of state deﬁned
as a trace-class operator becomes redundant, since different states of S(HS) can
determine the same probability measure on LRS(HS). In this case the notion of state
as a probability measure LR(HS) is a more faithful representation of the physical
realm. However, even in this case, the elements of S(HS) exhaust the convex body of
σ-additive probability measures on LR(HS). This is because every such measure can
be described by a positive trace-class operator with trace one, provided the splitting
of RS into algebras of deﬁnite type does not include type-I2 terms (Remark7.73). ■
How can the information of unbounded observables be included in RS?
We have the following useful technical result regarding unbounded observ-
ables A.
Proposition 11.5 Let A : D(A) →H be a (typically unbounded) self-adjoint oper-
ator on the Hilbert space H and deﬁne the collection of operators
An =

[−n,n]
λd P(A)(λ) for n ∈N.

Set id : R ∋λ →λ ∈R, in part (b) below. The following facts hold:
(a) A∗
n = An ∈B(H);
(b) P(An)(E) = P(A)((χ[−n,n] · id)−1(E)) for every Borel set E ⊂R, so that
P(A)(E)ψ =

n→+∞P(An)(E)ψ
for every E ∈B(R) and ψ ∈H;

(c) ∪n∈Nσ(An) coincides with σ(A), possibly up to the value 0. More precisely,
(i) σp(A) ⊂∪n∈Nσp(An) ⊂σp(A) ∪{0},
(ii) σc(A) \ {0} ⊂∪n∈Nσc(An) ⊂σc(A);
(d) If ψ ∈D(A), then Aψ = limn+∞Anψ.
Proof (a) The statement is an immediate consequence of Theorem9.4(b, f).
(b) The ﬁrst identity is a trivial application of Theorem9.4(h). The second identity
arises from the former, because either
(χ[−n,n] · id)−1(E) = E ∩[−n, n] if 0 /∈E
or
(χ[−n,n] · id)−1(E) = (E ∩[−n, n]) ∪(R \ [−n, n]) if 0 ∈E.
Consequently
P(An)(E) = P(A)(E ∩[−n, n]) if 0 /∈E
or, respectively,
P(An)(E) = P(A)(E ∩[−n, n]) + P(A)(R \ [−n, n]) if 0 ∈E,
which can be rephrased as
P(An)(E)ψ =

R
χEχ[−n,+n]d P(A)ψ
if 0 /∈E
or
P(An)(E)ψ =

R
χEχ[−n,+n]d P(A)ψ +

R
χR\[−n,n]d P(A)ψ
if 0 ∈E.
Eventually, Theorem9.4(f) together with the monotone convergence theorem (used
for the measure μψ) implies (11.2).
(c) Let us prove (c)(i). If λ ∈σp(An), where λ ∈[−n, n] since σ(An) ⊂[−n, n],
then P(An)({λ}) ̸= 0 from Theorem9.13(b)(i). Assuming λ ̸= 0, from the proof
of (b) we have that P(A)({λ}) = P(An)({λ}) ̸= 0. Therefore λ ∈σp(A) again by
Theorem9.13(b)(i). We have established that ∪nσp(An) ⊂σ(A) ∪{0}. With the
same argument, we see that if λ ∈σp(A) and λ ∈(−n, n), then either P(An)({λ}) =
P(A)({λ}) ̸= 0 or (if λ = 0) P(An)({λ}) = P(A)({λ})+ P(A)(R\[−n, n]) ̸= 0 again.
In both cases λ ∈σp(An) from Theorem9.13(b)(i). Therefore σp(A) ⊂∪nσp(An)
concluding the proof of (i).
Let us prove (ii). Suppose that λ ∈σc(A). From Theorem9.13(b)(ii), P(A)({λ}) =
0 and every open set J ∋λ satisﬁes P(A)(J) ̸= 0. Fix n and an open set J ′ such
that λ ∈J ′ ⊂(−n, n). As before P(An)({λ}) = P(A)({λ}) + P(A)(R \ [−n, n]), the
second term on the right-hand side appearing only if λ = 0. If λ ̸= 0, P(A)({λ}) = 0
implies P(An)({λ}) = 0. With the same reasoning we have P(An)(J ′) = P(A)(J ′) +
P(A)(R \ [−n, n]), the second term on the right-hand side appearing only if 0 ∈J ′.

602
11
Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
Since P(A)(J ′) ̸= 0 we conclude that P(An)(J ′) ̸= 0. If J ⊃J ′ is any other open set
containing λ, we similarly have P(An)(J) ≥P(An)(J ′) ̸= 0. Hence P(An)({λ}) = 0
and P(An)(J) ̸= 0, Theorem9.13(b)(ii) yields λ ∈σc(An) and so σc(A) \ {0} ⊂
∪nσc(An).Toestablishtheotherinclusion,assumeλ ∈σc(An)forsomen.Therefore,
usingTheorem9.13(b)(ii)andpart(b)above,0 = P(An)({λ}) = P(A)({λ})+P(A)(R\
[−n, n]),thesecondsummandpresentonlyifλ = 0.Weconcludethatboth P(A)({λ})
and P(A)(R\[−n, n]) vanish. If J ∋λ is any open set containing λ with J ⊂(−n, n),
again from Theorem 9.13(b)(ii) and (b) above, 0 ̸= P(An)(J) = P(A)(J)+ P(A)(R\
[−n, n]), where the last term may be there only if 0 ∈J. However we know that
P(A)(R \ [−n, n]) = 0 and so P(A)(J) ̸= 0. By enlarging J, what we have found
remains valid exactly as before. Theorem9.13(b)(ii) implies that λ ∈σc(A) since
P(A)({λ}) = 0 and P(A)(J) ̸= 0 for every open set J ∋λ. Summing up, we have
established the remaining inclusion ∪nσc(An) ⊂σc(A).
There is no way to ﬁx the problem with 0, since 0 may belong to ∪nσp(An)
even if 0 /∈σp(A), and in particular also when 0 ∈σc(A). In fact, 0 ∈σp(An) if
σ(A) ̸⊂[−n, n] for some n. In that case, deﬁning E := σ(A) \ [−n, n] we have
P(A)
E
̸= 0 (otherwise σ(A) ⊂[−n, n]) and every ψ ∈P(A)
E (H) with ψ ̸= 0 therefore
satisﬁes Anψ = 0, proving that 0 ∈σp(An). And this happens also when 0 /∈σp(A).
(As an example consider the operator X on L2(R, dx) such that Xψ(x) = xψ(x)
for x ∈R, with domain D(X) := {ψ ∈L2(R, dx) |

|xψ(x)|2dx < +∞}. Here
σ(X) = σc(X) = R, but σp(Xn) = {0} for every n = 1, 2, . . . .).
(d) The proof descends again from Theorem9.4(f) together with the monotone
convergence theorem.
□
The physical meaning of An is not completely obvious. Roughly speaking, we
can say that this observable is A itself, but it is measured by an instrument capable
of producing outcomes inside [−n, n].1 Every concrete instrument is of this type,
for n sufﬁciently large. It is therefore natural to assume, if the observable A is not
bounded, that every bounded observable An as above belongs to RS nevertheless.
This is equivalent to saying that the PVMs of the bounded self-adjoint operators An
belong to LRS(HS), because the elements of the PVM of a bounded normal operator
B commute with every bounded operator commuting with B (Theorem8.56(c), with
a characteristic function in place of f ). Since the PVM of A can be constructed out of
the PVMs of the An by exploiting the strong operator topology (Proposition11.5(b)),
we have that RS and therefore LRS(HS) contains the PVM of A as well. If, con-
versely, the PVM of A belongs in LRS(HS), every bounded operator An is contained
in RS as it is the strong limit of linear combinations of the elements of the PVM of
A, by (11.1).
In summary, we may say that although it contains only bounded observables, RS
retains however the full information of all observables of the system, including the
unbounded ones. This is because (we shall assume that henceforth) LRS(HS) also
1This characterisation is not 100% consistent with the features of An, since An more properly
describes an observable with value 0 if the outcome of the measurement of A belongs to R\[−n, n].
A real instrument with ﬁnite range would not perform any measurement outside its range.

contains the elements of the PVMs of every unbounded observable A. Equivalently,
RS contains the physically relevant bounded approximations An of A.
Technically speaking the mathematical notion relevant in this context is the fol-
lowing.
Deﬁnition 11.6 Given a von Neumann algebra R over the Hilbert space H, an oper-
ator A : D(A) →H, with D(A) ⊂H, is said to be afﬁliated to R if
U A ⊂AU
for every unitary operator U ∈R′.
In this case we write AηR.
The condition displayed above is equivalent to an apparently stronger requirement.
Proposition 11.7 Given a von Neumann algebra R over the Hilbert space H, an
operator A : D(A) →H with D(A) ⊂H is afﬁliated to R if and only if
U A = AU
for every unitary operator U ∈R′
(which is equivalent to
U AU ∗= A for every unitary operator U ∈R′).
In particular, it turns out that U(D(A)) = D(A) if U ∈R′ is unitary.
Proof If U A = AU for every unitary operator U ∈R′ then A is trivially afﬁliated to
R. Conversely, if AηR, left-applying U ∗gives U ∗U A ⊂U ∗AU, that is A ⊂U ∗AU.
Right-applying U ∗produces AU ∗⊂U ∗A. To conclude, observe that U ∈R′ ⇔
U ∗∈R′, so we may swap U ∗and U to obtain AU ⊂U A. Since also U A ⊂AU is
true, we conclude that U A = AU for U ∈R′. As a consequence U(D(A)) ⊂D(A),
but since U ∗A = AU ∗holds too, we also have U ∗(D(A)) ⊂D(A). Finally, applying
U gives D(A) ⊂U(D(A)), so that U(D(A)) = D(A).
□
The following useful result – especially condition (c) – holds.
Proposition 11.8 Let R be a von Neumann algebra over the complex Hilbert space
H and A : D(A) →H a closed operator with D(A) ⊂H dense. The following facts
are equivalent.
(a) AηR.
(b) If A = V P is the polar decomposition of A, then
(i) V ∈R,
(ii) PηR.
If A is self-adjoint, (a) and (b) are equivalent to
(c) the PVM of A satisﬁes P(A)

If A ∈B(H), then (a) and (b) are equivalent to

□
The conclusion is that given a quantum system described by a certain von
Neumann algebra of observables RS, the observables, bounded and unbounded,
are represented by self-adjoint operators afﬁliated to RS. Bounded observables are
also elements of RS.
11.1.3
Compatible Observables and Complete Sets of
Commuting Observables
The notion of compatible observables is important in physics:
Deﬁnition 11.9 Let S be a quantum system described on the Hilbert space HS. Two
observables A, B of S are compatible if the spectral measures P(A), P(B) of the
corresponding self-adjoint operators commute, i.e.
P(A)(E)P(B)(E) = P(B)(E)P(A)(E) ,
for any Borel set E ⊂R.
Two observables that are not compatible are called incompatible.
In physics, compatibility means the observables can be measured at the same time (in
agreement with axiom A1 and with the meaning of the associated spectral measures).
If we have a ﬁnite set of compatible observables A = {A1, A2, . . . , An}, a joint
spectral measure P(A) on Rn can be constructed using the spectral measures of
the self-adjoint operators representing the observables, by Theorem9.19. Retaining
those notations, if f : Rn →C is measurable, the self-adjoint operator
f (A1, . . . , An) :=

Rn f (x1, . . . , xn)d P(A)(x1, . . . , xn)
(11.3)
– with domain given by vectors ψ ∈H for which f ∈L2(Rn; μψ), where μψ(E) =
(ψ|P(A)(E)ψ), E ∈B(Rn), as usual – has the customary meaning of an observable
that is function of the observables A1, . . . , An.
From the physical point of view, if f is real-valued and the observables Ak are
pairwise compatible, the meaning of the observable f (A1, . . . , An) should be clear:
f (A1, . . . , An) is measured by simultaneously measuring A1, . . . , An, and then eval-
uating f on the values of the observables found. Obviously, this interpretation also
holds for n = 1, that is for f (A).
Remark 11.10 A necessary condition to have compatible observables is that the
corresponding operators commute, paying attention to domains as prescribed by
Theorem9.41. For unbounded self-adjoint operators this condition is not sufﬁcient,
despite what certain physics books might say: Nelson [Nel59] proved that there
are pairs of operators that commute on a dense subspace, invariant for both and on

11.1 Round-up and Further Discussion on Axioms A1, A2, A3, A4
605
which both are essentially self-adjoint, yet the spectral measures of the self-adjoint
extensions do not commute. A useful necessary and sufﬁcient condition for A and B
to be compatible is Theorem9.41(c):
eit AeisB = eisBeit A
for anys, t ∈R .
Another necessary and sufﬁcient condition is (d) in the same theorem.
■
The following notion, relying on Deﬁnition9.22 and due to Jauch [Jau60] (see also
[BeCa81]), plays a relevant role in the theory.
Deﬁnition 11.11 Consider a quantum system S described on the Hilbert space HS
and a family A = {A1, . . . , An} of observables with pairwise-commuting spectral
measures. Suppose
A′ = A′′ .
In other words, every operator B ∈B(HS) that commutes with the spectral measures
of the Ak necessarily belongs to A′′, which is equivalent to saying (Proposition9.23)
B = f (A1, . . . , An) for some f : supp(P(A)) →C bounded and measurable.
Then A = {A1, . . . , An} is called a complete set of commuting observables.
The condition A′ = A′′ is equivalent to the apparently weaker one A′ ⊂A′′, as
the inclusion A′ ⊃A′′ follows from the fact that the bounded measurable functions
f (A1, . . . , An) commute with the spectral measure of each Ak by construction. The
requirement A′ = A′′ can be proved to be the same as asking the Hilbert space be iso-
morphictoan L2 spaceonthejointspectrumofthe Ak [BeCa81],ortotheexistenceof
a cyclic vector for the joint spectral measure. Dirac speculated that the set of observ-
ables of a quantum system always admits a complete set of commuting observables.
Jauch [Jau60] gave the general version of Dirac’s postulate in terms of von Neumann
algebras, positing the existence of a set of pairwise-commuting observables A such
that A′ = A′′. Dirac’s original conjecture referred only to observables with point
spectrum. Some simple examples of complete sets of commuting observables will
be given below.
If RS = B(HS), we can use any complete set of compatible observables A =
{A1, . . . , An} to prepare the system in a pure state, in the sense of Remark7.39(3),
when each Ak admits a point spectrum part. Indeed, if λk ∈σp(Ak) for k = 1, . . . , n,
then the orthogonal projector
P(λ1,...,λn) := P(A1)
{λ1} · · · P(An)
{λn}
projects onto a subspace H(λ1,...,λn) ⊂HS which must be one-dimensional. (If that
were not the case, it would be easy to construct an observable commuting with the
spectralmeasuresofallofthe Ak,whichisnotafunctionofthem:ifH(λ1,...,λn) contains
two normalised orthogonal vectors ψ1, ψ2, the orthogonal projector B = (ψ1| )ψ1
is such an observable.) Therefore, whenever the outcome of the simultaneous (non-
destructive, ideal) measurements of A1, . . . , An is the set of values (λ1, . . . , λn), the

606
11
Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
state after the measurement procedure must be the pure state represented by the unit
vector (unique, up to phase) ψ ∈H(λ1,...,λn), as follows immediately from A3.
In the general case where RS does not necessarily coincide with the whole B(HS),
the existence of a complete set of commuting observables implies that the commutant
R′
S is contained in RS, and therefore it coincides with the centre of RS. In particular,
a self-adjoint operator or an orthogonal projector that commutes with the observables
is an observable itself. We have, in fact, the following elementary, though important,
result by Jauch [Jau60].
Proposition 11.12 If RS contains a complete set of commuting observables then
R′
S is Abelian and coincides with the centre RS ∩R′
S.
Proof Let A ⊂RS be a complete set of commuting observables. As A′ = A′′ we also
have A′′ = A′′′. On the other hand RS ⊃A′′ ⇒A′′′ ⊃R′
S ⇒RS ⊃A′′ = A′′′ ⊃R′
S.
We conclude RS ⊃R′
S, and therefore R′
S coincides with the centre of RS. In
particular R′
S is Abelian.
□
Example 11.13
(1) Consider a quantum particle without spin, with reference to the rest space R3 of an
inertial frame system (see below, axiom A5). In this case HS = L2(R3, dx). The three
position operators A = {X1, X2, X3} or the momentum operators B = {P1, P2, P3}
give complete sets of commuting observables. A further property of these complete
sets of commuting observables is that RS is the von Neumann algebra generated by
A ∪B. It is in fact possible to prove that the commutant (which coincides with the
centre) of this von Neumann algebra is trivial (for it contains an irreducible unitary
representation of the Weyl–Heisenberg group), so (A ∪B)′′ = B(H) = RS. (See
also Remark11.46.)
(2) If we add to the picture the spin space (for instance when we consider an electron
“without charge”), then HS = L2(R3, dx) ⊗C2. A complete set of commuting
observables is A = {X1 ⊗I, X2 ⊗I, X3 ⊗I, I ⊗S3}, where S3 is the spin observable
(see Sect.12.3.1) along the z-axis. Another is B = {P1 ⊗I, P2 ⊗I, P3 ⊗I, I ⊗S1}.
As before (A ∪B)′′ is the von Neumann algebra of observables of the system (note
the crucial change of spin component in A and B). In this case, too, the commutant
of the von Neumann algebra of observables is trivial, yielding RS = B(HS).
■
The von Neumann algebra A generated by a complete set of observables is a
maximal Abelian von Neumann subalgebra of RS, namely it satisﬁes A = A′. Spelt
out: (a) it is Abelian, A′ ⊂A, and (b) it satisﬁes the maximality requirement that A
already contains all the elements of B(HS) commuting with each element of A. The
existence of a maximal Abelian von Neumann subalgebra of RS is equivalent to the
commutativity of R′
S:
Proposition 11.14 Let R be a von Neumann algebra. The following three facts are
equivalent.
(a) R admits a maximal Abelian von Neumann subalgebra A ⊂R with A = A′.
(b) R′ coincides with the centre of R: R′ = R ∩R′.
(c) R′ is Abelian: R′ ⊂R′′.

11.1 Round-up and Further Discussion on Axioms A1, A2, A3, A4
607
Proof The implications (a) ⇒(b) ⇒(c) have already been established in Propo-
sition11.12: A ⊂R entails R′ ⊂A′, but A′ = A ⊂R by (a), so R′ ⊂R and
hence (b) holds. If (b) holds, R′ ⊂R = R′′ so (c) holds. It is evident that (c) ⇒(b):
R′ ⊂R(= R′′), so that R′ ∩R′ ⊂R′ ∩R ⊂R′ and so R′ = R′ ∩R.
Let us ﬁnally prove (b) ⇒(a). From Zorn’s lemma one easily obtains that every
von Neumann algebra R always contains an Abelian von Neumann subalgebra A that
is maximal with respect to R: there is no larger Abelian von Neumann subalgebra
of R. In particular, if A ∈R commutes with every element of A, A (and hence
A∗) must belongs to A, for otherwise the algebra generated by A, A∗and A would
be Abelian and larger than A. Our algebra A therefore satisﬁes A′ ∩R ⊂A. As
A ⊂A′ and A ⊂R we also have A ⊂A′ ∩R. Summarising, every von Neumann
algebra R always contains a von Neumann subalgebra A such that A = A′ ∩R.
Let us resume the proof of (b) ⇒(a). Take A ⊂R such that A = A′ ∩R. Part
(b) implies R′ = R ∩R′, but R ∩R′ ⊂R ∩A′, because A′ ⊃R′ as A ⊂R.
Finally R ∩A′ = A in view of our initial choice for A. To sum up, we have obtained
R′ ⊂A, and consequently R(= R′′) ⊃A′. The hypothesis A = A′ ∩R entails
A = A′, concluding the proof.

Remark 11.15 A further result established by Jauch in [Jau60] is that a maximal
Abelian von Neumann subalgebra A ⊂R can always be written as A = {A}′ for
a suitable self-adjoint operator A ∈A. Assuming that R = RS is the algebra of
observables of a quantum system, since {A}′ = A = A′ = {A}′′, Propositions11.14
and 11.12 prove that the existence of a complete set of commuting observables in
RS (in particular {A}) is equivalent to the fact that R′
S is Abelian.

Superselection Rules
This section is devoted to the extension of the concept of superselection rules that
were introduced in Sects.7.71 and 7.7.2.
11.2.1
Superselection Rules and von Neumann Algebra of
Observables
Let us summarise the elementary theory of superselection rules of Sects.7.7.1, 7.7.2
and add further material and remarks. The focus will be on the interplay between
the algebra of observables RS and the associated logic of elementary propositions
LRS(HS). We shall mainly discuss the mathematical structures, since physical exam-
ples were presented in 7.7.1 (see also Sect.12.3.2). A further instance regarding the
Bargmann superselection rule will be presented in Sect.12.3.4. The discussion will
continue in Sect.14.1.7. As a general reference on the subject we suggest [Ear08].

Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
In presence of superselection rules, axioms Ss1 and Ss2 (Sect.7.7.1) are con-
straints on A1–A3.2 We will analyse ﬁrst the von Neumann algebra RS, and next the
space of states in presence of superselection rules.
Speaking about the von Neumann algebra of observables RS over the separable
Hilbert space HS, axiom Ss2 is mathematically equivalent to the identiﬁcation
L (HS)adm := LRS(HS)
(11.4)
together with the demand of a non-trivial centre for RS, because the centre of the asso-
ciated lattice LRS(HS) is supposed non-trivial and atomic. More precisely (according
to Proposition7.71) the centre of LRS(HS) contains a family of orthogonal projectors
{Pk}k∈K with the following properties:
(i) Pk ̸= 0,
(ii) Pk ⊥Ph if h ̸= k,
(iii) s-
k∈K Pk = I,
(iv) there is no orthogonal projector Q ∈RSk ∩R′
Sk with 0 < Q < Pk for any
k ∈K.
(Proposition7.70 permits to replace (iii) with
(iii)’ the central family {Pk}k∈K is maximal with respect to (i) and (ii).)
The structure of RS and HS according to Ss2 (taking Proposition7.70 into account)
can now be described as follows. Setting HSk := Pk(HS):
(a) the family {Pk}h∈K is unique up to relabelling.
(b) Each HSk is invariant under RS: A(HSk) ⊂HSk if A ∈RS.
(c) RS ∋A →πk(A) := A↾HSk: HSk →HSk is a ∗-algebra representation of RS.
(d) Each RSk := πk(RS) is a factor in the Hilbert space HSk.
(e) RS has a direct decomposition into factors RSk:
H =

k∈K
HSk ,
RS =

k∈K
RSk
(11.5)
(f) There is a partition K = ⊔j∈J K j such that
H( j)

and R( j)
S

k∈K j
RSk ,

whereH( j)

S aretheclosedsubspacesanddeﬁnite-typevonNeumannalgebras
of Theorem7.68. In particular every factor RSk, for k ∈K j, is of the same type as
the corresponding R( j)
S .
2Alternatively, if we wish to describe states in terms of σ-additive measures, superselection rules are
encapsulatedinaxiomsSs1(measure-theoryformulation)andSs2(measuretheoryformulation)
(Sect.7.7.2). These, too, should be understood as limitations to A1, A2 (measure-theory version),
A3 (measure-theory version).

11.2 Superselection Rules
609
The pairwise orthogonal spaces HSk are the well-known coherent sectors or
superselection sectors. The representations πk deﬁned in these sectors enjoy a
couple of relevant properties.
Proposition 11.16 In presence of superselection rules on the separable Hilbert
space HS ̸= {0} with coherent sectors HSk, k ∈K, the above ∗-algebra repre-
sentations πk of the von Neumann algebra of observables RS are
(i) not faithful, i.e. not injective,
(ii)pairwiseunitarilynon-equivalent:thereisnounitaryoperatorU : HSk →HSh
such that Uπk(A)U −1 = πh(A) for every A ∈RS when h ̸= k.
Proof As πk(Pk) = πk(I) for I ̸= Pk, πk cannot be injective. A unitary operator U
intertwining πk and πh with k ̸= h cannot exist because it would satisfy
0h = πh(Pk) = Uπk(Pk)U −1 = U IkU −1 = Ih ,
where 0h is the zero operator and Ih the identity on Hh (Hh ̸= {0} since Ph ̸= 0). □
Remark 11.17 When superselection rules are present R′
S ∩RS is not trivial, since it
contains the orthogonal projectors onto coherent sectors. A more difﬁcult question is
the converse one: to decide whether superselection rules are present in case R′
S ∩RS
is non-trivial. The point is to understand whether the centre of LRS(HS) is atomic. If
not, the desired decomposition 
k Pk = I in terms of central atoms is not achievable.
However, in that case the Hilbert space HS can be written as a direct integral, and
one can talk about continuous superselection rules [Jau60, Giu00]. These have a
different nature, and will not be of our concern. (See also Remark 11.22 below.) ■
Let us address states in presence of superselection rules.
To complete the description of superselection rules, Ss1 requires that the admis-
sible states in presence of superselection rules are those in the convex subset (7.61):
S(HS)adm := {ρ ∈S(HS) | ρPk = Pkρ
for any k ∈K}.
The extreme elements of S(HS)adm identify naturally with elements of the sets
Sp(HSk), and hence deﬁne admissible pure states (7.57) in presence of superselec-
tion rules
Sp(HS)adm :=

k∈K
Sp(HSk) .
An alternative description employs σ-additive probability measures over
L (HS)adm = LRS(HS) (see (7.63)). These are maps
μ : L (H)adm →[0, 1] with μ(I) = 1

610

such that
μ


i=0
Qi
	
=
+∞

i=0
μ(Qi) for {Qi}i∈N ⊂LRS(HS) with Qi ⊥Q j if i ̸= j.
It turns out that both the space of admissible states S(HS)adm and the space of σ-
additive probability measures over L (H)adm are big enough to separate the elements
of L (H)adm (Propositions7.85 and 7.86). The space of measures is, vice versa,
separated by admissible propositions L (HS)adm (Proposition7.86).
Proposition7.87 establishes that the two descriptions of quantum states, via trace-
class operators or measures, are essentially equivalent also in the presence of super-
selection rules. Every state ρ ∈S(HS)adm deﬁnes a unique associated σ-additive
probability measure: μ(P) := tr(ρP) for every P ∈LRS(HS). Conversely, if none
of the RSk is a type-I2 factor, for every σ-additive probability measure over LRS(HS)
there is at least one state ρ ∈S(HS)adm satisfying the condition above.
There remains the problem that two states ρ, ρ′ ∈S(HS)adm may result physically
equivalent, as they determine the same probability measure on LRS(HS), that is
μ(P) = tr(Pρ) = tr(Pρ′) for every P ∈LRS(HS). In this respect the next
result is interesting: it relies on Proposition7.88 and has an important interplay with
Proposition11.12. It is a reﬁnement of an analogous result established in [Jau60]
when the centre of LRS(HS) is atomic.
Proposition 11.18 In presence of superselection rules, assume that R′
S is Abelian
(which happens, in particular, if RS contains a complete set of commuting observ-
ables). The following two facts hold.
(a) The subalgebra RSk associated to the superselection sector HSk, as in (11.5),
is a maximal factor: RSk = B(HSk) and the representation πk is irreducible. In
particular, RS is of type I.
(b) If two states ρ, ρ′ ∈S(HS)adm satisfy tr(Pρ) = tr(Pρ′) for every P ∈
LRS(HS)adm, they must coincide: ρ = ρ′.
If, conversely, R′
S is not Abelian, both (a) and (b) are false (but RS may still be of
type I).
Proof (a) Consider an orthogonal projector P ∈LRSk(HSk)′ for some k ∈K. Since
LRSk(HSk)′′ = Rk we furthermore have P ∈R′
k. Extending it to the null operator
on H⊥
Sk we ﬁnd an orthogonal projector in R′
S, still denoted by P. In our hypotheses
R′
S ⊂R′′
S = RS so that R′
S = RS ∩RS (this is the case in presence of a complete set
of commuting observables, by Proposition11.12). Therefore P ∈R′
S ∩RS and, in
particular, P belongs to the centre of the lattice LRS(HS). More precisely, it belongs
to the centre of LRSk(HSk), which is trivial simply due to the superselection rule.
So, either P = 0 or P = Pk. We have obtained that LRSk(HSk)′ = {0, Ik} where
Ik is the identity operator in HSk viewed as Hilbert space. Hence RSk = B(HSk)
(Proposition7.61(e)) and so LRSk(HSk) = L (HSk). Since Rs is the direct sum of
type-I factors, it has type I as well. Evidently πk is irreducible, because its image
coincides with the whole B(HSk) and by Proposition3.93.

11.2 Superselection Rules
611
(b) Immediately descends from Proposition7.88.
Let us prove the last statement. Suppose that R′
S is not Abelian. By decomposing
every operator B ∈R′
S as B = C + i D with C, D ∈R′
S self-adjoint, we conclude
that there must exist an operator A ∈R′
S that is self-adjoint but not of the form λI
(otherwise R′
S would be Abelian). Therefore U = eit A ∈R′
S is not a pure phase
but it commutes with every observable, and in particular with every superselection
projector Pk. For some k ∈K there must exist ψ ∈HSk with unit norm such
that ψ′ = Uψ ̸= eiaψ for every a ∈R (otherwise U would be a pure phase).
Since U commutes with every observable, we have tr(Pρψ) = tr(Pρψ′) for every
P ∈B(HS)adm, and therefore (b) is violated. Notice that U restricted to HSk deﬁnes
a non-trivial unitary operator in R′
Sk, so RSk is strictly contained in B(HSk) and (a)
is false.
□
Deﬁnition 11.19 If a given physical system S with algebra of observables RS is
subjected to superselection rules and R′
S Abelian, then the superselection rules are
said to be Abelian.
If a quantum system admits Abelian superselection rules, then the simplest versions
of axioms A1–A4 hold as soon as we restrict to a coherent sector HSk and the factor
RSk (not of type I2): all orthogonal projectors represent elementary observables, all
self-adjoint operators represent observables and states are correspond one-to-one to
probability measures on the lattice of elementary propositions.
11.2.2
Abelian Superselection Rules Induced by Central
Observables
In the exhaustive survey [Wigh95], Wightman conjectured that superselection rules
are associated to a set of pairwise compatible, physically meaningful observables
Q1, . . . , Qn, sometimes called superselection charges, whose spectral measures (as
well as any bounded Q j, if any) belong to the centre of RS. It is also supposed that
σ(Q j) = σp(Q j) .
(What follows is however valid also in case σc(Q j) ̸= ∅for some j, provided
P
(Q j)
σc(Q j) = 0, where P(Q j) is the PVM of Q j.) As every Q j refers to a different
superselection rule, it is implicit that the different superselection rules are compatible
with one another, in the obvious sense. This comes from experimental evidence.
From this point of view the Hilbert space splits in an orthogonal sum of closed
subspaces HSk, k ∈K, and every k is ﬁxed by the values that all charges Q j simul-
taneously assume on HSk. In other words, if P
(Q j)
q j
is the orthogonal projector of
Q j onto the q j-eigenspace, the family of central projectors {Pk}k∈K is the family of
spectral projectors

where k ∈K (⊂N) labels bijectively n-tuples of values (q1, . . . , qn) ∈σ(Q1) ×
· · · × σ(Qn). To obtain a fully ﬂedged superselection rule, in view of Ss2, we have
to impose that the orthogonal projectors Pk are atoms of the centre of LRS(HS) and
that Ss1 holds: the admissible states are those commuting with the Pk.
Example 11.20 The proton and the neutron can be viewed as two different pure
states of the so-called isotopic spin τ3, described by the self-adjoint operator
τ3 =
 1 0
0 −1

(11.7)
on the Hilbert space C2. This quantity is related to the electric charge observable Q
(here assumed normalised to ±1) under Q = 1
2(τ3 + I). Neutron states correspond
to eigenvalue −1 whereas proton states correspond to eigenvalue 1. In view of the
superselection rule of the electric charge, no coherent superposition of a proton state
and a neutron state is possible. In other words, in every admissible state the charge
must have a deﬁnite value. On the other hand, if we treat these particles as non-
relativistic particles, the superselection rule of the mass is present (see Sect.12.3.4):
the mass observable M must have a deﬁnite value in every pure state. The Hilbert
space of the proton/neutron system must split into coherent sectors where the mass
and the charge of the system are deﬁned simultaneously in every possible vector
state.
The full isotopic spin consists of further components τ1 and τ2 together with τ3.
These bounded, self-adjoint operators are described by the other Pauli matrices σ1
and σ2 (which are also used for the spin components of a particle with spin 1/2, see
later). The operators τi are deﬁned on an internal Hilbert space isomorphic to C2 but
different from the spin space. Within the isospin model of strong interactions, the
physical demand is that strong interactions (i.e. the part of the Hamiltonian operator
associated with the strong force) are invariant under the unitary group SU(2) spanned
by the τi: U(β1, β2, β3) = ei 3
j=1 β jτ j. However, as Q, that is τ3, is associated to
a superselection rule (τ3 belongs to the centre of RS), the remaining self-adjoint
operators τ1 and τ2 cannot live in RS nor in R′
S, since they do not commute with τ3 ∈
RS ∩R′
S. Of the three, in other words, only the self-adjoint operator τ3 corresponds
mathematically to an observable.
■
The requirement that the orthogonal projectors P(Q1)
q1
· · · P(Qn)
qn
generating the joint
spectral measure of the Q j are atoms of the centre of LRS(HS) is equivalent to the
demand that every bounded, central observable must be a function of Q1, . . . , Qn in
the sense of Eq.(11.3):
{Q1, . . . , Qn}′′ = RS ∩R′
S .

11.2 Superselection Rules
613
(As usual {Q1, . . . , Qn}′ is deﬁned as the commutant of the spectral measures of
all the Q j if one of them is not bounded, cf. Deﬁnition9.22.) We have indeed the
following result.
Proposition 11.21 Let RS be the von Neumann algebra of a quantum system S
described on the separable Hilbert space HS. Consider n observables Q1, . . . , Qn
such that, for j = 1, . . . , n,
(i) the spectral measure P(Q j) belongs to the centre of RS,
(ii) σ(Q j) = σp(Q j).
If P
(Q j)
q j
is the orthogonal projector onto the q j-eigenspace of Q j, the following facts
are equivalent.
(a) The orthogonal projectors P(Q1)
q1
· · · P(Qn)
qn
with (q1, . . . , qn) ∈σ(Q1) × · · · ×
σ(Qn) are atoms of the centre of LRS(HS).
(b) Every observable A ∈RS ∩R′
S is a function of Q1, . . . , Qn as in (11.3).
If the above facts hold and A is a (typically unbounded) observable with spectral
measure P(A) in ∈RS ∩R′
S, then
P(A)
σc(A) = 0 .
In particular, the interior of σc(A) must be empty.
Proof (a) ⇒(b). Assume that (a) is valid. If A is a self-adjoint operator in RS we
must have AP(Q1)
q1
· · · P(Qn)
qn
= P(Q1)
q1
· · · P(Qn)
qn
A because P(Q1)
q1
· · · P(Qn)
qn
belongs to
the centre of RS. Consequently:
A(q1,...,qn):=A↾H(q1,...,qn): H(q1,...,qn) →H(q1,...,qn)
is a bounded self-adjoint operator on the common eigenspace H(q1,...,qn) of Q1, . . . Qn
with eigenvalues (q1, . . . , qn), viewed as Hilbert space. Suppose by contradiction
A(q1,...,qn) ̸= r I(q1,...,qn)
for every r ∈R (I(q1,...,qn) is the identity operator on H(q1,...,qn)). Then the spectral
measure of A(q1,...,qn) would contain some non-trivial projector P ̸= 0, I(q1,...,qn).
Extending P to the null operator over H⊥
(q1,...,qn) would generate a central orthogonal
projector P such that 0 < P < P(Q1)
q1
· · · P(Qn)
qn
, because P commutes with every
operator commuting with A and A is in the centre of RS. This is incompatible with
the hypothesis that P(Q1)
q1
· · · P(Qn)
qn
is a central atom of LRS(HS). Therefore
A(q1,...,qn) = r(q1, . . . , qn)I(q1,...,qn)
for some real number r(q1, . . . , qn).
In other words (in strong sense)
A =

(q1,...,qn)∈σ(Q1)×···×σ(Qn)
r(q1, . . . , qn)P(Q1)
q1
· · · P(Qn)
qn

614
11
Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
which is (11.3) specialised to our case. Hence (b) holds. (Since σp(Q1)×· · ·×σp(Qn)
is a countable subset of Rn, as HS is separable, it easy to prove that every map
r : σp(Q1) × · · · × σp(Qn) →R extended as zero on the rest of Rn is Borel-
measurable.)
Next, we claim that if (a) fails, then (b) fails. For that we notice preliminarily that
any observable in RS ∩R′
S that is function of Q1, . . . , Qn has the form (in strong
sense)
f (Q1, . . . , Qn) =

(q1,...,qn)∈σ(Q1)×···×σ(Qn)
f (q1, . . . , qn)P(Q1)
q1
· · · P(Qn)
qn
,
(11.8)
for some bounded function f : σ(Q1) × · · · × σ(Qn) →R. As a consequence,
the operator f (Q1, . . . , Qn) is the identity up to a constant factor (the eigenvalue
f (q1, . . . , qn)) over each H(q1,...,qn). If P(Q1)
q1
· · · P(Qn)
qn
were not an atom of the centre
of LRS(HS), for ﬁxed (q1, . . . , qn), there would be a central orthogonal projector Q
with 0 < Q < P(Q1)
q1
· · · P(Qn)
qn
. This would be a central observable different from a
constant multiple of the identity on H(q1,...,qn), so it could not possibly be a function
of Q1, . . . , Qn. This proves that (a) false ⇒(b) false.
The last statement is easy. Since (Proposition11.5) A is the strong limit on D(A)
of An := AP(A)
(−n,n] and each observable An is bounded, belongs to RS ∩R′
S, and
σc(A) = ∪n∈Nσc(An) up to the zero value, it is enough to prove the claim for
A ∈RS∩R′
S.From(11.8)everysuch A (whichweknowisafunctionof Q1, . . . , Qn)
admits every common eigenvector of Q1, . . . , Qn as eigenvector. Fixing a Hilbert
basis (of common eigenvectors) in every H(q1,...,qn) we have an overall Hilbert basis of
HK made of eigenvectors of A. This is equivalent to saying that I = s- 
a∈σp(A) P(A)
{a} ,
where P(A)
{a} is the orthogonal projector onto the a-eigenspace. From (i) in the spectral
Theorem8.56(b) we know that P(A)
{a} is also the projector of the PVM of A associated
with the Borel set {a}. Since these sets are pairwise disjoint when a ∈σp(A), we
have:
P(A)
σp(A) = s-

a∈σp(A)
P(A)
{a} = I .
(11.9)
But σc(A) ∩σp(A) = ∅⇒0 = P(A)
σc(A)P(A)
σp(A), so (11.9) forces 0 = P(A)
σc(A).
If (a, b) ⊂σc(A), by (ii) in the spectral Theorem8.56(b), P(A)
(a,b) ̸= 0. But that is
impossible since P(A)
(a,b) ≤P(A)
σc(A) = 0.
□
The superselection rules induced by the central observables Q1, . . . , Qn give rise
to the usual factor decomposition (11.5). Each sector HSk carries a corresponding
representation πk of the algebra RS of observables of the system. The fact that
different representations πk are unitarily inequivalent can now be proved by looking
at the superselection charges. For k ̸= h, there is no Hilbert space isomorphism (i.e.,
unitary operator) U : HSk →HSh with
Uπk(A)U −1 = πh(A) ∀A ∈RS .

11.2 Superselection Rules
615
This is because πk(Q j) = q jk Ik and the sets (q1k, . . . , q jk) are different for different
k by hypothesis, so that every such U would produce the contradiction:
Uπk(Q j)U−1 = q jkU IkU−1 = q jk Ih ̸= q jh Ih = πh(Q j) for some j = 1, 2, . . . , n.
As we already know in the general case, the representations πk cannot be faithful
because πk(Q j −q jk I) = 0, albeit Q j −q jk I ̸= 0 for some j, otherwise the centre
RS ∩R′
S would be trivial and no superselection rule would occur. If, ﬁnally, R′
S is
Abelian, the representations πk are also irreducible, as proved in Proposition11.18,
since their images are the whole spaces B(HSk).
In summary: if the superselection rules are Abelian, the πk are non-faithful, irre-
ducibleandunitarilyinequivalentrepresentationsofthetype-I vonNeumannalgebra
of observables RS, labelled by the set of eigenvalues of the superselection charges
Q j. Notice that the charges Q j generate the full R′
S, for this coincides with the centre
RS ∩R′
S in the case at hand.
We shall return to these issues in Sect.14.1.7, when we compare this description
of the superselection rules with the one arising from the algebraic formulation of
quantum theories.
Remarks 11.22 (1) It is worth stressing that Wightman’s hypothesis on Abelian
superselection rules cannot be the general way to select admissible states and admis-
sible observables. In non-Abelian gauge theories, like quantum chromodynamics,
the commutant of the algebra of observables is not Abelian. This is evident from the
fact that every admissible observable must be invariant under a non-Abelian (unitary)
gauge (Lie) group. It is not possible to deﬁne simultaneously the self-adjoint gener-
ators of the corresponding Lie algebra because these do not commute by hypothesis.
Hence these self-adjoint operators do not represent central observables (it is even dis-
putable whether they all represent observables, if truth be told), nor is the selection
of admissible states and observables a consequence of Wightman’s superselection
rule in this setting. We remark that, in agreement with Proposition11.12, quantum
chromodynamics and other non-Abelian gauge theories cannot admit any complete
set of commuting observables, nor is it possible, in these theories, to prepare a state
represented by a vector (up to phases) by a sequence of measurements.
(2) It has been conjectured more than once that quantities with classical behaviour are
actually quantum observables whose spectral projectors describe superselection rules
[BGJKS00], i.e. superselection charges. From this perspective certain superselection
rules are dynamical and arise from the interaction between the physical system and
the ambient, thereby producing the phenomenon called decoherence [BGJKS00].
(3) Theoretically speaking, the picture in which superselection rules are associated
to central observables with only point spectrum is completely general, and applies
to all quantum systems affected by superselection rules. Indeed, if a physical system
admits superselection rules deﬁned by the central family {Pk}k∈K satisfying the usual
properties (i)–(iv) on the separable Hilbert space HS, it is always possible to deﬁne
a central observable Q inducing the family {Pk}k∈K. It sufﬁces to relabel the family
by N ⊂N (the whole N if K is inﬁnite) and deﬁne

Q := s-

Obviously σ(Q) = σp(Q) = N.
(4) In view of (3) and the last statement in Proposition11.21, if the centre of
the von Neumann algebra of observables RS contains at least one observable
A with P(A)
σc(A) ̸= 0 (in particular σc(A) contains an interval), no superselection
rules are allowed. However, it would still be possible to understand the structure
of RS (and the convex set of states) in terms of continuous superselection rules
(Remark11.17).

11.2.3
Non-Abelian Superselection Rules and the Gauge
Group
Given a physical system S described on the (separable) Hilbert space HS with von
Neumann algebra of observables RS, either in presence of superselection rules or
not, R′
S may or not be Abelian. It is non-Abelian if and only if R′
S is larger that the
centre of RS. In this case, and if we restrict to one superselection sector HSk, not
every orthogonal projector represents an elementary proposition, and not each self-
adjoint operator corresponds mathematically to an observable. Therefore we are led
to conclude that there exist further constraints on the nature of physical observables,
besides the commutation with the central projectors Pk describing superselection
rules, since the elements of RS are supposed to commute with all elements in R′
S
and not only the central elements. It may happen that the centre of RS is trivial, so
that no superselection (described by central projectors) takes place, yet R′
S is non-
trivial. In the remaining part of the section we shall consider the generic case, where
RS has a non-trivial centre and R′
S is not Abelian.
In relation to the noncommutativity of R′
S, Jauch and Misra [JaMi61] studied the
interplay between superselection rules and gauge symmetries.3
Deﬁnition 11.23 Givenaphysical system S described on the Hilbert spaceHS ̸= {0}
with von Neumann algebra of observables RS, a gauge symmetry (also known as
a gauge transformation) is a unitary operator on HS that commutes with every
element of RS. These unitary operators form a unitary group called the gauge group
which is a subset of R′
S called, in turn, gauge algebra.
Evidently, the interesting case is that in which the gauge group and the gauge algebra
are not Abelian.
Remark 11.24 (1) It should be clear that a densely-deﬁned closed operator A :
D(A) →HS commutes with every element of the gauge group if and only if it is
afﬁliated to RS. In particular, A ∈B(HS) commutes with every gauge symmetry if
and only if A ∈RS.

If U belongs to the gauge group of RS, U is unitary and so it admits a spectral
decomposition and an associated PVM P(U) in fulﬁlment of Theorem8.56. Every
orthogonal projector P(U)
E
must commute with every bounded operator commuting
with U, therefore P(U)
E
∈R′
S and the closed subspaces H(U)
E
:= P(U)
E
(HS) are
invariant under every element of RS. In case U does not belong to the centre of
RS we therefore have further RS-invariant subspaces, in addition to the possible
coherent sectors. If the spectrum of U is a point spectrum, we have a direct Hilbert
decomposition of HS into eigenspaces of U: this decomposition is invariant under
RS, exactly as the decomposition into coherent sectors, but it does not coincide with
it. Finally, if there is another gauge transformation U ′ that does not commute with
U, it gives rise to its own decomposition of HS, different from that of U. So some
of the features of superselection rules linger in the presence of a non-Abelian gauge
group, even if the centre of RS is trivial. For this reason one sometimes says that
non-Abelian superselection rules are present if the gauge group is non-Abelian.
Referring to Non-Abelian Gauge Field Theories, this is the case for the so-called
global gauge transformations acting on the physical Hilbert space (after all non-
physical states with “non-positive norm"have been removed by the gauge-ﬁxing
procedures) [BNS91].
Due to Proposition11.12, however, the existence of a complete set of commuting
observables implies that the gauge group is Abelian. Said otherwise, a non-Abelian
gauge group prevents the existence of complete sets of commuting observables.
This happens for instance in quantum chromodynamics, where the gauge group of
quarks, called internal colour gauge symmetry, is isomorphic to SU(3). Remark
13.45 will address another example of an algebra of observables admitting a non-
Abelian gauge group, in relation to quantum systems made of identical subsystems
(see also Remark13.47 and the end of Sect.13.4.8).
What is the general structure of RS? First of all we have to focus on the centre
RS ∩R′
S of RS, and check whether it is trivial or not. In view of Proposition11.18
there are two instances of the utmost physical interest.
(A) RS ∩R′
S is non-trivial (with atomic associated lattice) and R′
S is Abelian.
Then superselection rules occur and RS splits in a direct sum of factors RSk. As
R′
S is Abelian this is the end of the story, since RSk = B(HSk) and RS is of type
I. Consequently, the representations πk of RS on each sector HSk are not faithful,
irreducible and unitarily inequivalent (Remark 11.22(3)). Bounded observables cor-
respond exactly to self-adjoint operators in 
k∈K B(HSk). This is the same as saying
that observables (even unbounded ones) exhaust the self-adjoint operators afﬁliated
to that von Neumann algebra.
In this situation, describing quantum states in terms of trace-class operators in
S(HS)adm is physically sound, because elementary propositions separate these oper-
ators. An equivalent description (up to the issues with type-I2 factors) is the one in
terms of probability measures on BRS(HS).

11
Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
(B) RS ∩R′
S is non-trivial (with atomic and central associated lattice) and R′
S
is non-Abelian. Additional constraints on the observables are present, so RSk ̸=
B(HSk) for some k ∈K. Since RS ∩R′
S = R′′
S ∩R′
S, the centre of RS coincides
with the centre of R′
S. Having assumed the lattice is atomic, also R′
S is a direct
sum of factors (R′)Sk ⊂B(HSk). It is easy to see that (R′)Sk = (RSk)′ =: R′
Sk
for every k ∈K. Hence the observables pertinent to each sector are constrained to
commute with every element of R′
Sk. Each sector HSk is therefore associated with
a pair of, generally non-trivial, factors RSk, R′
Sk (which satisfy, in particular: (a)
(R′
Sk)′ = RSk, (b) RSk ∧R′
Sk = {cI}c∈C and (c) RSk ∨R′
Sk = B(HSk)). Each
sector HSk has its own gauge group and at least one of them is not Abelian. The
representations πk of RS on each sector HSk are not faithful nor unitarily equivalent,
and some representations are reducible. When its centre is not trivial, the factor RSk
may or not be of type I, and there is no complete set of commuting observables.
The overall von Neumann algebra of observables is 
k∈K RSk, with commutant

k∈K R′
Sk.
In this situation, a description of quantum states in terms of trace-class operators
on S(HS)adm turns out to be redundant, because elementary propositions do not
separate operators of this kind. Probability measures on BRS(HS) work better. In
particular, pure states cannot be faithfully described by unit vectors (up to phase),
and furthermore it is not possible to prepare the state of the system in a vector state
by measuring a family of compatible observables with pure point spectrum.
Therearethreemainways,atleast,todescribethephysicalpropertiesofaquantum
system in terms of the non-Abelian commutant of the von Neumann algebra of
observables.
1. Elementary systems (particles) with non-Abelian internal gauge symmetry. This
is the case of quarks and other hadrons. The Hilbert space representing a single
sector of the Abelian superselection rules affecting the system (e.g., the electric
charge) is a product H ⊗HG. While HG is isomorphic to Cn for some n ≥3
and carries an irreducible representation of SU(3) (the colour group SU(3)),
H supports an irreducible representation of the (universal covering of the proper
orthochronous) Poincaré group with positive energy and mass, and deﬁnite spin s.
The bounded observables are the elements in the von Neumann algebra generated
by the representation of the Poincaré group, hence they are of the form A ⊗I for
every self-adjoint operator A ∈B(H). As H is isomorphic to L2(R3, dk)⊗C2s+1,
the algebra of observables R is a type-I∞factor. Instead R′, which is made of
operators I ⊗B with B ∈B(Cn), is a factor of type In.
2. Inﬁnitely extended thermodynamical systems at ﬁnite (non-zero) temperature.
These systems may be studied as thermodynamical limits of localised systems
(e.g. systems deﬁned on increasingly large lattices), or as genuinely inﬁnitely
extended systems like quantum ﬁelds in Minkowski or curved spacetime (for
instance represented by a Weyl C∗-algebra via the GNS construction associ-
ated to a KMS state, see Chap.14). The von Neumann algebra of observables is
reducible (as required by the very KMS condition), but under suitable hypotheses

– corresponding to a pure phase state – it is a type-III factor[Emc72, Haa96,
ReSu07].
3. A von Neumann algebra of observables R(O) localised on a bounded causally-
complete region O in spacetime for a quantum ﬁeld in Minkowski space-
time within the so-called Haag–Kastler formulation[Emc72, Haa96, Rob04,
ReSu07]. Here R(O)′ is made of the observables localised on the causal com-
pletion of O and is a highly non-trivial von Neumann algebra. In general R(O)′
is not a factor, but a type-I I I von Neumann algebra.

Miscellanea on the Notion of Observable
This section focuses on some features of either practical or theoretical nature regard-
ing observables.
11.3.1
Mean Value and Standard Deviation
Proposition7.52 enables us to associate to any pair “observable–state”, A, ρ, a prob-
ability measure on R, μ(A)
ρ
: E →tr(ρP(A)(E)) with E ∈B(R) (coinciding with
μ(A)
ψ
= (ψ|P(A)(E)ψ), cf. Theorem8.52(c), if ρ is pure and determined by the unit
vector ψ ∈H). By construction supp(μ(A)
ρ ) ⊂σ(A). Since by deﬁnition μ(A)
ρ (E)
is the probability that the measurement of A belongs to E, in the state ρ, it makes
sense to deﬁne the mean value and the standard deviation of A in the state ρ.
Deﬁnition 11.25 Let A be an observable of the physical system S described on the
Hilbert space HS, ρ ∈S(HS) a state of S and μ(A)
ρ
the probability measure associated
to ρ and A as above. The mean value of An, n = 1, 2, . . . , is
⟨An⟩ρ :=

R
λn dμ(A)

when R ∋λ →λnis in L1(R, μ(A)
ρ ).

ρ (λ),
when R ∋λ →λ2is in L1(R, μ(A)

(11.11)
The mean value of An (or the standard deviation) does not exists for ρ in case
expression (11.10) (or (11.11)) cannot be made sense of.
Remark 11.26 If the map λn belongs to L1(R, μ(A)
ρ ) then also λk does, for any
k = 1, 2, . . . , n −1, because μ(A)
ρ
is ﬁnite. Therefore if ⟨An⟩ρ exists, so does ⟨Ak⟩ρ

Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
The properties of Example 7.53 generalise as follows.
Proposition 11.27 Let A be an observable for a system described on the separable
Hilbert space HS, and take ρψ := ψ(ψ|·) ∈Sp(HS) associated to ψ ∈HS with
||ψ|| = 1 and ρ ∈S(HS).
(a) (i) ⟨A⟩ρψ exists ⇔ψ ∈D(|A|1/2), and Aρψ exists ⇔ψ ∈D(A).
(ii) If ψ ∈D(A) then ⟨A⟩ρψ exists, and:
⟨A⟩ρψ = (ψ|Aψ) ,
(11.12)
(iii) If ψ ∈D(A2) then ⟨A⟩ρψ and Aρψ exist, Eq.(11.12) holds, and:
A2
ρψ =

(11.13)
(b) (i) ⟨A⟩ρ exists ⇔Ran(ρ1/2) ⊂D(|A|1/2) and |A|1/2ρ1/2 ∈B2(H).
(ii) Aρ exists (equivalently ⟨A2⟩ρ exists) ⇔Ran(ρ1/2) ⊂D(A) and Aρ1/2 ∈
B2(H).
(iii) If ⟨A2⟩ρ exists, then Aρ ∈B1(HS) and:
⟨A⟩ρ = tr(Aρ) .
(11.14)
(iv) If ⟨A4⟩ρ exists, then Aρ ∈B1(HS), Eq.(11.14) holds, (A −⟨A⟩ρ I)2ρ ∈
B1(HS) and:
A2
ρ = tr

(A −⟨A⟩ρ I)2ρ

= tr(A2ρ) −tr(Aρ)2 .
(11.15)
Proof (a) We have tr(ρψ P(A)(E)) = (ψ|P(A)(E)ψ) = μ(A)
ψ (E). Therefore asking
that R ∋λ →λ and R ∋λ →λ2 belong in L1(R, μ(A)
ρψ ) is respectively equivalent
to ψ ∈D(|A|1/2) and ψ ∈D(A), by Deﬁnition9.14. By deﬁnition, and using
Theorem9.4(e, f) for the standard deviation:

Using Theorem9.4(e) these imply (11.12) and (11.13) if ψ ∈D(A)(⊂D(|A|1/2))
and ψ ∈D(A2)(⊂D(A)), respectively.
(b) Let {ψn}n∈N be a basis of HS (separable). Then μ(A)

ρ1/2ψ(E) implies that (11.18) is trivially true if | f | = s
is a simple non-negative map. For any Borel-measurable function g ≥0 there is a
simple sequence 0 ≤s0 ≤s1 ≤· · · ≤sn →g (Proposition7.49). By monotone
convergence on the single integrals and on the counting measure of N we obtain
(11.18), with | f | replaced by an arbitrary g ≥0. If f is real-valued, and in (11.18)
we have < +∞, decomposing f in its positive and negative parts f = f+ −f−,
0 ≤f+, f−≤| f |, gives (11.19) by linearity. If f is complex-valued the argument is
similar, we just work with real and imaginary parts separately. Now, ⟨f (A)⟩ρ exists
precisely when the left-hand side in (11.18) is ﬁnite. In turn, this is the same as saying
every summand on the right is ﬁnite and the sum is ﬁnite. The generic term is ﬁnite if
and only if ρ1/2ψn ∈D(| f (A)|1/2) by deﬁnition of D(g(A)) (Deﬁnition9.14). Since
ψn is an arbitrary unit vector in H, Ran(ρ1/2) ⊂D(| f (A)|1/2). Every integral on the
right in (11.18) can be written as (see Theorem9.4(f)) ||| f (A)|1/2ρ1/2ψn||2, where
| f (A)|1/2ρ1/2 ∈B(HS) by Proposition5.7. By Deﬁnition4.2.4 we conclude that the
left-hand side (11.18) is ﬁnite iff | f (A)|1/2ρ1/2 ∈B2(HS). Choose f (λ) = λ, so (i)
in (b) holds, then choose f (λ) = λ2 to obtain (ii) in (b), because λ2 integrable in
μ(A)
ρ
implies λ integrable, plus D(A) = D(|A|). To prove (iii) assume ⟨A2⟩ρ exists
(so also ⟨A⟩ρ exists), and notice that Ran(ρ) ⊂D(A) from Ran(ρ1/2) ⊂D(A),
since ρ = ρ1/2ρ1/2 ⇒Ran(ρ1/2) ⊃ran(ρ). Applying (11.19) to f (λ) = λ and
recalling Theorem9.4(e) we ﬁnd:
⟨A⟩ρ =

n∈N
(ρ1/2ψn|Aρ1/2ψn) =

n∈N
(ψn|ρ1/2 Aρ1/2ψn) = tr(ρ1/2 Aρ1/2) ,
where we used ρ1/2, Aρ1/2 ∈B2(H2), so their product (in any order) is of trace
class. Since the trace is invariant under cyclic permutations (Proposition4.38(c))
we have ⟨A⟩ρ = tr(Aρ1/2ρ1/2) = tr(Aρ), concluding (iii). The proof of (iv) is
similar: replace A with A2 and observe that if ⟨A4⟩ρ exists, so does ⟨A2⟩ρ, and (iii)
holds. The second identity in (11.15) now follows from the ﬁrst by obvious algebraic
manipulations.
□
Remark 11.28 The right-hand sides of (11.14) and (11.15) ((11.12) and (11.13) for
pure states) are not the deﬁnitions of mean value and standard deviation. These are
given, in general, by (11.10) and (11.11), independently from Proposition11.27. ■

11.3.2
An Open Problem: What is the Meaning of
f (A1, . . . , An) if A1, . . . , An are Not Pairwise
Compatible?
The interpretation, both mathematical and physical, of certain formal objects that
appear in textbooks has been deliberately swept under the carpet, until now. We have
in mind particular expressions of the sort f (A1, . . . , An), for a real-valued function
f and a set of observables A1, . . . , An that are not pairwise compatible. Expressions
of this kind have great relevance in physics: think of the Hamiltonian operator of
the electron in the hydrogen atom. i.e.
P2
2m + V (x). Here the two summands are
incompatible observables. Even von Neumann tackled the issue in his celebrated
book on theoretical foundations of QM without reaching a conclusive answer. Here
we shall just introduce the physical side of the problem, without ﬁnding a solution
to it. The mathematics will be discussed brieﬂy in one case of physical relevance in
Sect.11.5.8.
Even the physical meaning of f (A1, . . . , An) is dubious, since the observables
A1, . . . , An cannot be measured simultaneously. If we were able to measure a bunch
of observables simultaneously, f (A1, . . . , An) would clearly be the observable that
is measured by evaluating f on the simultaneous readings of the Ak. This physical
interpretation for compatible observables agrees with the mathematical deﬁnition of
f (A1, . . . , An) given by (11.3). Not all is lost though, for in certain cases something
can be said for incompatible observables, too. Consider:
S := f (A1, . . . , An) = a1A1 + · · · + an An
for some real coefﬁcients ak. Suppose that S is (essentially) self-adjoint on some
dense domain D common to all operators Ak. Recalling the deﬁnition of mean
value, we can think of the observable S as the only observable that satisﬁes:
⟨S⟩ρψ = a1⟨A1⟩ρψ + · · · + an⟨An⟩ρψ
for every unit vector ψ ∈D.
(The interpretation can be extended to include mixed states.) The point is that to
check the relation above it is not necessary to measure A1, . . . , An simultaneously.
It is enough to measure them separately on a corresponding statistical ensemble
of identical physical systems, when the physical systems of the various statistical
ensembles are all prepared in the pure state ρψ. The advantage of this proposal is
that it holds also when A1, . . . , An are pairwise incompatible. Its drawback is that it
will not work for more complicated functions f , though it sometimes suggests other
remarkable interpretations. First of all, even if A1, . . . , An are pairwise incompatible,
the observable (a1A1 +· · ·+an An)k is well deﬁned and has a clear physical meaning
whenever a1A1 + · · · + an An is deﬁned as above. But more interestingly, we take
inspiration from the real function

(11.20)
when A and B are incompatible. In principle, the right-hand side has a clear physical
interpretation relying upon the iteration of the mean-value interpretation presented
above. Life, however, is not that easy. Indeed, if we forget that meaning for the
moment, the right-hand side in (11.20) can equivalently be rewritten as:
1
2(AB + B A) .
Unfortunately, this operator is only Hermitian and not (essentially) self-adjoint in
general, when A and B are self-adjoint but not bounded (more or less the standard in
Quantum Mechanics). Therefore the initial, simplistic physical interpretation cannot
always be supported by the mathematics we have developed. Every case has to be
investigated separately, for instance by choosing some essential self-adjoint exten-
sion of the Hermitian operator at hand, constructed as a function of incompatible
observables.
11.3.3
The Notion of Jordan Algebra
From a completely theoretical point of view, it is worth noticing that (11.20) can
be understood as a Jordan product, when A and B are elements of the algebra of
bounded operators B(H):
A ◦B := 1
2(AB + B A) .
(11.21)
Domains cause no trouble, and A ◦B is self-adjoint if A and B are self-adjoint. The
Jordan product is commutative:
A ◦B = B ◦A for all A, B ∈B(H)
(11.22)
but not associative. On the contrary it satisﬁes:
(A ◦B) ◦(A ◦A) = A ◦(B ◦(A ◦B)) for all A, B ∈B(H).
(11.23)
As a consequence of latter two, it can be proved that a weak form of associativity
holds, for powers of a ﬁxed element. Hence A ◦A ◦· · · ◦A is well deﬁned.

624
11
Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
Deﬁnition 11.29 A vector space A (over C or R) equipped with an operation ◦:
A × A →A that is bilinear, distributive with respect to the product by scalars, and
satisﬁes (11.22) and (11.23), is called a (complex or real) Jordan algebra.
A Jordan algebra is said to be special if it is constructed out of an associative algebra
by deﬁning the Jordan product as in (11.21), making use of the product in the algebra
itself. So, in particular, B(H) is a complex special Jordan algebra. Similarly, the real
algebra of bounded self-adjoint operators in B(H) generates a corresponding real
special Jordan algebra. More generally, if RS ⊂B(HS) is the von Neumann algebra
of observables of a physical system, the class of self-adjoint operators of RS form
a real special Jordan algebra when equipped with the natural structure induced by
B(HS). Sometimes it is convenient to develop the quantum theory on S by referring
directly to this Jordan algebra instead of the whole RS.
The notion of real special Jordan algebra plays an important role in the attempts
of several authors, especially I. Segal and G.G. Emch [Emc72, Str05a], to justify
physically the algebraic formulation of quantum theories that we will introduce in
the last chapter.
11.4
Axiom A5: Non-relativistic Elementary Systems
In order to move farther into the mathematical formulation of QM we need to set
axioms about special elementary systems. These correspond to the particles of the
non-relativistic theory. In other terms, the group of transformations under which the
theory is invariant is the Galilean group, not the Poincaré group. We will return to this
point later. In physics this description is adequate until speeds do not reach the order
of the speed of light (about 300.000km/s). However certain mathematical concepts,
like the Weyl ∗-algebra introduced in the forthcoming non-relativistic description,
are signiﬁcant in a wider context. They are employed in relativistic regimes as well,
in formulations of Quantum Field Theory that we will not discuss.
In elementary formulations of quantum theories, complex systems are built by
composing elementary systems via the Hilbert tensor product, as we shall see when
we study compound systems.
The simplest elementary system in non-relativistic QM consists in a quantum
particle of mass m > 0 and spin 0. The next axiom holds in this system.
A5. Consider an inertial frame system I with orthonormal Cartesian coordinates
x1, x2, x3 on the rest space of the frame. A non-relativistic particle of mass m > 0
and spin 0 is described as follows.
(a) The system’s Hilbert space is H = L2(R3, dx), where R3 is identiﬁed with the
rest space of I under the coordinates x1, x2, x3, and dx is the ordinary Lebesgue
measure on R3.
(b) The three observables associated to x1, x2, x3 are self-adjoint operators, called
position operators:

(c) The three observables associated to the momentum components p1, p2, p3 in I
are self-adjoint operators, called momentum operators:
Pk = −iℏ∂

,
(11.25)
k = 1, 2, 3, where the operator on the right is the closure of the essentially self-adjoint
differential operator:
−iℏ∂
∂xk
: S (R3) →L2(R3, dx)
and S (R3) is the Schwartz space on R3 (see Sect.3.7).
Vectors (normalised to 1) of L2(R3, dx) associated to a particle are called its
wavefunctions in physics’ literature. Wavefunctions determine (not uniquely, owing
to arbitrary numerical factors) the particle’s pure states.
Remarks 11.30 (1) The discussion of Sect.5.3 explains that the same notions can
be given if we deﬁne D(Xi) using ψ ∈D(R3) or ψ ∈S (R3), instead of ψ ∈
L2(R3, dx). In either case one has to take the unique self-adjoint extension of the
operator on D(R3) or S (R3).
(2) Pi may be deﬁned equivalently by (see Deﬁnition 5.27, Proposition5.29 and the
ensuing discussion):

(see Proposition5.29) can be deﬁned, equivalently, substituting the Schwartz space
with D(R3) and taking the unique self-adjoint extension of the operator obtained,
which is still essentially self-adjoint.
(3) Let Ki denote the ith position operator on the codomain of the Fourier–Plancherel

The Canonical Commutation Relations (CCRs)
The deﬁnition of position and momentum is such that there exist invariant spaces
H0 ⊂L2(R3, dx) for all six observables, despite the latter’s domains are different:
Xi(H0) ⊂H0 and Pi(H0) ⊂H0, i = 1, 2, 3. One instance is the Schwartz space
H0 = S (R3), whose invariance is immediate, by deﬁnition. On S (R3) a direct com-
putation that uses (11.24) and (11.25) yields Heisenberg’s canonical commutation
relations (CCRs) :
[Xi, Pj] = iℏδi j I ,
where δi j = 0 for i ̸= j and δi j = 1 for i = j . More precisely
Lemma 11.31 The operators position Xi and momentum Pj, i, j = 1, 2, 3, deﬁned
in A5, obey Heisenberg’s commutation relations:
[Xi, Pj]ψ = iℏδi jψ
for every ψ ∈D(Xi Pj) ∩D(Pj Xi), i, j = 1, 2, 3 . (11.28)
Equations (11.28) do not change when we replace Xi with X′
i := Xi + ai I and Pj
with P′
j := Pj + b j I, for any constants ai, b j ∈R.
Proof A straightforward computation shows D(X′

D(Pj Xi). On ϕ ∈D(R3), the operator P′

Since X′

Consequently (11.28) holds by taking a j = b j = 0, j = 1, 2, 3.

plest manifestation of general CCRs for bosonic quantum ﬁelds, where position and

momentum are deﬁned suitably to beﬁt the theory. From the physical viewpoint it
has been noticed over and over, during the history of QM and its evolution, that the
canonical commutation relations are much more important than the operators Xi and
Pi themselves.
As the deﬁnitions make obvious, position and momentum are unbounded opera-
tors, and are not deﬁned on the entire Hilbert space. Technically speaking this is a
thorn in the side, for it forces to bring into the picture the spectral theory of unbounded
operators, which is more involved than the bounded theory. This begs the question
whether a substitute deﬁnition of Xi, Pi might exists, that preserves Heisenberg’s
relations and makes the operators bounded. The answer is no, and the reason is
dictated by Heisenberg’s CCRs.
Proposition 11.32 There are no self-adjoint operators X and P such that, on a
common invariant subspace, [X, P] = iℏI and at the same time X, P are bounded.
Proof Suppose, by contradiction, [X, P] = iℏI on a common invariant space D
where X, P are bounded. Restrict to D (or its closure D, by extending X, P to self-
adjoint operators deﬁned on D), and consider it as the Hilbert space. The restrictions
will now be self-adjoint and bounded. From [X, P] = iℏI:
P Xn −Xn P = −inXn−1 .
If n is odd, using Proposition3.38(a) repeatedly (as X p = (X p)∗for any natural
number p) and the norm’s properties:
n||X||n−1 = n||Xn−1|| ≤2||P||||Xn|| ≤2||P||||X||||Xn−1|| = 2||P||||X||||X||n−1.
As ||X|| ̸= 0 (because of (11.28)), we obtain the absurd: n ≤2||P||||X|| < +∞for
any n = 1, 3, 5, . . . .

11.4.2
Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle as a Theorem
A comforting immediate consequence of the CCRs and of the formalism is to turn
Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle for the variables position and momentum (cf.
Sect.6.4) into a theorem. We shall prove the principle in its classical form on pure
states, only to reformulate it later under weaker assumptions on vectors and then
extend it to mixed states.
Theorem 11.33 (“Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle”) Let ψ be a unit vector,
describing a pure state of a classical spinless particle, such that:
ψ ∈D(Xi Pi) ∩D(Pi Xi) ∩D(X2

(in particular ψ ∈S (R3)). Then

Weyl’s Relations, the Theorems of Stone–von
Neumann and Mackey
The CCRs satisfy a remarkable property: in the statement of axiom A5 it is some-
how superﬂuous that the Hilbert space be L2(R3, dx), as is to ask that the position
and momentum operators have the given form. This information is by some means
contained in Heisenberg’s relations so long as, loosely put, the representation of
position and momentum is irreducible. This fact is the heart of the famous theorem
of Stone–von Neumann, that we will prove in this section. By dropping irreducibility
Mackey proved (as a consequence of more general facts in the theory of imprimitivity
systems) that the Hilbert space is an orthogonal sum of irreducible representations
(countably many if the space is separable). We will prove Mackey’s theorem after
Stone–von Neumann’s.

11.5.1
Families of Operators Acting Irreducibly and Schur’s
Lemma
Before we get going, a few generalities on families of operators acting irreducibly
are necessary. Tightly linked to this notion is Schur’s lemma, a very useful result
from abstract representation theory of unitary groups that we will encounter in the
next chapter. We remind the reader that a subspace M in a vector space X is said to
be invariant under the operator A : X →X when A(M) ⊂M (Deﬁnition2.35).
Deﬁnition 11.35 Let H be a Hilbert space and A := {Ai}i∈J a family of operators
Ai : H →H. The space H is called irreducible under A , and A is an irreducible
family of operators on H, if there is no closed subspace in H different from H and
{0} that is invariant under every element in A simultaneously.
Remark 11.36 Every so often it is necessary to distinguish between irreducibility
and topological irreducibility under a given family of operators. Irreducibility refers
to the absence of non-trivial invariant subspaces, whereas topological irreducibility
concerns the absence of closed non-trivial invariant subspaces. In this book we shall
notmakethatdistinction:forusirreducibilitywillrefertoclosedsubspacesimplicitly,
and we shall omit the term “topological” everywhere.

Here is Schur’s lemma.
Proposition 11.37 (Schur’s lemma) Let A := {Ai}i∈J ⊂B(H) be a family of
operators on a complex Hilbert space, closed under Hermitian conjugation (A∗
i ∈A
if Ai ∈A ). Then
(a) A is irreducible ⇔every operator V ∈B(H) satisfying
V Ai = AiV
for every i ∈J,
has the form V = χ I for some complex number χ ∈C.
(b) Let A ′ := {A′
i}i∈J ⊂B(H′) be a family on another Hilbert space H′, indexed
by the same set J and closed under the Hermitian conjugation. Suppose
A∗
i = A ji ⇒A′∗
i = A′
ji for every i ∈Jand some ji ∈J.
(11.31)
If H and H′ are irreducible, then every bounded linear operator S : H →H′ such
that
SAi = A′
i S for every i ∈J,
has the form S = rU where U : H →H′ is unitary and r ∈R.
Proof Let us begin with the more involved part (b), which we will employ for (a).
(b) Taking adjoints of SAi = A′
i S gives A∗
i S∗= S∗A′∗
i for any i ∈J. That is to
say A ji S∗= S∗A′
ji, i ∈J. Note how ji covers J as i varies in J, since for every
Ai ∈A , (A∗
i )∗= Ai, so we may rephrase the identity as Ai S∗= S∗A′
i for every

630
11
Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
i ∈J. Comparing with SAi = A′
i S gives Ai S∗S = S∗SAi and A′
i SS∗= SS∗A′
i.
From the former the bounded self-adjoint operator V := S∗S commutes with every
Ai, so by Theorem8.56(c) the spectral measure P(V ) on R commutes with each Ai.
But then, for every E ∈B(R), the closed space P(V )
E
(H) is invariant under each Ai.
As the space is irreducible, either P(V )
E
(H) = H i.e. P(V )
E
= I, or P(V )
E
(H) = {0}
i.e. P(V )
E
= 0, for any Borel set E ⊂R. Suppose the spectrum of V contains at least
two values α ̸= α′ and let us use Theorem9.13(b). Consider two open disjoint real
intervals E ∋α, E′ ∋α′. Then P(V )
E
̸= 0, P(V )
E′
̸= 0 since the intervals intersect
the spectrum, and therefore the only possibility is P(V )
E
= P(V )
E′
= I. On the other
hand P(V )
E
P(V )
E′
= 0 since E ∩E′ = ∅. This is absurd because standard properties
of PVM imply P(V )
E′
+ P(V )
E
≤I. So the spectrum of V (never empty) contains a
single isolated point, which is in the point spectrum. Hence S∗S = V = λI for some
λ ∈[0, +∞), V being clearly positive. In a similar manner we obtain SS∗= λ′I for
some λ′ ∈[0, +∞). But then
λS∗= S∗SS∗= λ′S∗.
Consequently either λ = λ′ or S∗= 0 and so S = (S∗)∗= 0. In the second case the
proof ends. In the ﬁrst instance, let U := λ−1/2S, so that UU ∗= I ′ and U ∗U = I
where I, I ′ are the identity operators of H, H′. Therefore U is unitary. The claim is
proved by taking r = λ1/2.
Let us pass to (a) and assume H is irreducible under A . If V Ai = AiV , then
A∗
i V ∗= V ∗A∗
i , meaning AiV ∗= V ∗Ai for any i ∈J, as A is ∗-closed. Then the
bounded self-adjoint operators V+ := 1
2(V + V ∗) and V−:= 1
2i (V −V ∗) commute
with A , implying that their spectral measures commute with A . Arguing as in part
(b) we conclude V± = λ±I for some real constants λ±. Then V = V+ + iV−=
(λ+ + iλ−)I = χ I, χ ∈C. Conversely, suppose that the only operators commuting
with A are multiples χ I. If H0 is invariant under A and P is the orthogonal projector
onto H0, then PAiP = AiP for any i ∈J. Take adjoints: PA∗
i P = P A∗
i . As A is
∗-closed and i ∈J arbitrary, the identity reads P Ai P = P Ai. Comparing with the
initial relation gives P Ai = Ai P, i ∈J. Therefore P = χ I for some χ ∈C. But
P∗= P ⇒χ ∈R, and P P = P ⇒χ2 = χ. So there are two possibilities: P = 0,
and then H0 = {0}, or P = I so H0 = H. This means H is irreducible under A .
□
Remark 11.38 Schur’s lemma, in cases (a) and (b), will be particularly useful in
these situations:
(i) A , A ′ are images of two representations π : A →B(H), π′ : A →B(H′)
of the same ∗-algebra (or C∗-algebra) A.
(ii) A , A ′ are images of two unitary representations G ∋g →Ug, G ∋g →U ′
g
of a single group G.
In either case, closure under Hermitian conjugation in case (a), and (11.31) in case
(b), are automatic if one takes respectively G and A as the indexing set I.

11.5.2
Weyl’s Relations from the CCRs
In order to illustrate the Stone–von Neumann theorem we proceed step by step. A
relevant technical point is that Heisenberg’s commutation relations are too hard to
use rigorously, for they involve subtleties about domains. To by-pass these issues
we can abandon Xi and Pi for the one-parameter unitary groups they generate.
Even better, we may take, for n = 3, the operators n
i=k tk Xk + uk Pk, tk, uk ∈R.
These are essentially self-adjoint on S (R3), so we can look at the exponentials of
their self-adjoint extensions n
i=k tk Xk + uk Pk. A brute-force computation based on
Heisenberg’s relations (11.28) and the formal Taylor expansion of the exponential
(not yet justiﬁed) yields the following identity4:

The above are called Weyl relations, and follow formally from Heisenberg’s com-
mutation relations.
The announced proposition proves, completely independently from previous results
that involve different techniques, that the operators Xi, Pi are essentially self-adjoint
if restricted to S (R3), even in dimension higher than 3. For convenience, we will
assume ℏ= 1 in the sequel.
Proposition 11.39 Consider L2(Rn, dx), with given n = 1, 2, · · · and Lebesgue
measure dx on Rn. For k = 1, 2, · · · , n deﬁne symmetric operators:
Xk : S (Rn) →L2(Rn, dx) and Pk : S (Rn) →L2(Rn, dx)
(Xkψ) (x) = xkψ(x) ,
(11.32)
(Pkψ) (x) = −i ∂ψ

(x) .
(11.33)
Then:
(a) the symmetric operators n
k=1 tkXk + ukPk, deﬁned on S (Rn), map S (Rn)
to itself and are essentially self-adjoint for any (t, u) ∈R2n.
(b) L2(Rn, dx) is irreducible under the family of bounded operators:
4If the exponentiated operators were n × n complex matrices the result would follow from the cel-
ebrated Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula: eAeB = e[A,B]/2eA+B, valid when the matrix [A, B]
commutes with both A and B.

(c) The operators W satisfy Weyl’s relations:
W((t, u))W((t′, u′)) = e−i
2(t·u′−t′·u)W((t+t′, u+u′)),
W((t, u))∗= W(−(t, u)).
(11.35)
(d) For given (t, u) ∈R2n, every mapping R ∋s →W(s(t, u)) satisﬁes:
s- lim
s→0 W(s(t, u)) = W(0) .
(11.36)
Proof Let us begin with L2(Rm, dx) where m = 1, for the generalisation to ﬁnite
m > 1 is obvious. We will use tools from Sect.9.1.4. At present we just have the
operators X and P. Both are well deﬁned when restricted to the Schwartz space
S (R), and admit each a self-adjoint extension that coincides with X, P, as previously
discussed.
We want to construct a dense subspace of analytic vectors for the symmetric
operators aX + bP : S (R) →L2(R, dx), for any a, b ∈R. Deﬁne, on the
dense domain S (R), the annihilation operator, creation operator and number
operator:

(11.37)
By construction A∗⊃A⋆, (A⋆)∗⊃A, and N is symmetric. By direct computation
the CCRs (or the above deﬁnition) force certain commutation relations on S (R),
namely:
[A, A⋆]↾S (R)= I↾S (R) .
(11.38)
It is a well-known fact in the theory of orthogonal polynomials that the complete
orthonormal system in L2(Rn, dx) of Hermite functions {ψn}n=0,1,... ⊂S (R) (cf.
Example3.32(4)) satisﬁes ψ0 = π−1/4e−x2/2 and the recursive formula:

By deﬁnition of A⋆, that is the same as saying Hermite functions arise, once ψ0 is

At the same time a straightforward computation produces

Aψ0 = 0.
(11.40)
Equations (11.39), (11.40) and (11.38) justify, by induction, the middle relation in
the triple (details in Sect.9.1.4):
A⋆ψn =
√
n + 1ψn+1 ,
Aψn = √nψn−1 ,
N ψn = nψn ,
(11.41)
The right side in the second one is assumed null if n = 0, and as one sees easily the
ﬁrst identity is just the recursive relation introduced a few lines above; the third one
follows from the other two.
As the ψn are normalised to 1, the ﬁrst two in (11.41) give the inequality:

where every Ai is either A or A⋆. Consider a symmetric operator on S (R) given by
an arbitrary real combination T := aX + bP, a, b ∈R. By (11.37), if z := a + ib
we have
T = zA + zA⋆

(11.43)
This and (11.42) imply, for any Hermite function ψn:
||T kψn|| = 2−k/2||(zA + zA⋆)kψn|| ≤2−k/22k|z|k!
(n + k)! = |z|k!

(in the end we used Stirling’s formula). Therefore any ﬁnite combination of Hermite
functions is analytic for every T := aX +bP on S (R). As the latter are symmetric,
they must be essentially self-adjoint on S (R) by Nelson’s theorem (Theorem5.47).
This ends the proof of case (a) for m = 1. If m > 1 the argument is similar, keeping
in mind that Hermite functions in n variables:
ψk1,...,km(x1, . . . , xm) := ψk1(x1) · · · ψkm(xm)
are a complete orthonormal system in L2(Rm, dx) (see Example10.27(1)). What we
have seen proves (a), but also (d) and the second identity in (c): in fact

by construction, because by deﬁnition of closable operator A we have s A = s A for

since R ∋s →W(s(t, u)) is a one-parameter unitary group.
To prove (b) we shall invoke Lemma11.40, which we will prove after the present
theorem but relies only on part (a). Suppose there is a non-null closed space H0 ⊆
L2(Rn) invariant under W((t, u)), and let ψ ̸= 0 be an element of H0. Taking
φ ∈H⊥
0 , we will prove φ = 0 and so H0 = L2(Rn). By assumption, H0 and the
orthogonal complement are invariant:
(φ|W((t, 0)W((0, u))ψ) = 0 ,
for any (t, u) ∈R2n.
I.e.

= 0 ,
for any (t, u) ∈R2n.
The left side can be computed with (11.50), (11.51) in Lemma11.40:

Rn eit·xφ(x)ψ(x + u) dx = 0 ,
for any t, u ∈Rn.
Since the map x →hu(x) := φ(x)ψ(x + u) is in L1(Rn, dx), as product of
L2(Rn, dx) maps, and given that t ∈Rn is arbitrary, the identity simply tells that
the Fourier transform of hu ∈L1(Rn, dx) is zero. By Proposition3.105(f)hu is null
almost everywhere. In other terms:
φ(x)ψ(x + u) = 0 almost everywhere for any given u ∈Rn.
(11.44)
Call E ⊂Rn the set on which ψ is not null, and F the set where φ never vanishes.
(Both are measurable as pre-images of the open set C\ {0} under measurable maps.)
Denote by m the Lebesgue measure of Rn, so m(E) > 0 by assumption. To satisfy
(11.44) we must have:
m(F∩(E−u)) = 0 for anyu ∈Rn, i.e.

χF(x)χE(x+u)dx = 0 for anyu ∈Rn.

As m(E) > 0, we have m(F) = 0 and so F = ∅. Therefore φ is null almost
everywhere, hence the null vector of L2(Rn, dx). So H0 = L2(Rn, dx), proving
irreducibility in (b).
There remains to show
W((t, u))W((t′, u′)) = e−i
2(t·u′−t′·u)W((t + t′, u + u′)) .
(11.45)
For this we need two steps. Introduce
U((t, u)) := e
i
2 (t·u)W((t, 0))W((0, u)) .
Step one will prove that
U((t, u))U((t′, u′)) = e−i
2(t·u′−t′·u)U((t + t′, u + u′)) .
(11.46)
Step two consists in showing
U((t, u)) = W((t, u)) ,
(11.47)
which will conclude the overall proof.
Exactly as in part (b), Lemma11.40 implies:

Hence, for given ψ ∈L2(Rn, dx),

This is the same as (11.46), which is eventually justiﬁed. Let us pass to (11.47).
Consider, for t, u ﬁxed, the unitary family Us := U(s(t, u)), s ∈R. Directly from

(11.48) we verify Us+s′ = UsUs′ and U0 = I. Therefore {Us}s∈R is a one-parameter
unitary group. The strategy is now to prove that the group is strongly continuous, ﬁnd
its generator and show it coincides with the generator of {W(s(t, u))}s∈R. By Stone’s
theorem (Theorem9.33) the two groups will be the same, hence giving (11.47). As

Consider the integrals on the right. The middle one, by Schwarz’s inequality, tends
to zero when the other two do, because its square is less than the product of the

other two. By dominated convergence the last integral is inﬁnitesimal as s →0,
because the integrand tends to 0 pointwise and is uniformly bounded by the L1
map C|t · xψ(x)|2, for some constant C > 0. The ﬁrst integrand also tends to 0
pointwise, as s →0. We want to use Lebesgue’s theorem, so we need an L1 upper
bound, uniform in s around 0 (hence independent of s). Decomposing the integral
and recalling ψ ∈S (Rn), it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a uniform L1 bound in s ∈[−ε, ε] for
the expressions


and


in order to obtain a bound of the whole integrand. Assume ψ real (if not, decompose
ψ in real and imaginary parts) and invoke the mean value theorem:

ψ(x + su) −ψ(x)
s
 =
u · ∇ψ|x+s0u
 ,
where s0 ∈[−ε, ε]. Since ψ ∈S (Rn), for any p = 1, 2, . . . there is K p ≥0 with
|u · ∇ψ|x| ≤
K p
1 + ||x||p .
If we ﬁx ε > 0, u ∈Rn and p = 2, 3, . . . , there is C p,ε > 0 such that
1
1 + ||x + s0u||p ≤
C p,ε
1 + ||x||p−1
for any x ∈Rn, s0 ∈[−ε, ε].
Therefore, for a certain constant C ≥0:

ψ(x + su) −ψ(x)
s
 ≤
C
1 + ||x||n+1 ,
x ∈Rn, s ∈[−ε, ε].
The map on the right and its square are in L1(Rn, dx), and this is what we wanted
in order to apply Lebesgue’s theorem. Hence (11.49) is proved.
Summing up, the self-adjoint generator of the strongly continuous unitary group
{U(s(t, u))}s∈R coincides with the generator of {W(s(t, u))}s∈R on S (Rn). Since
the second generator is essentially self-adjoint on that space, and as such it admits
a unique self-adjoint extension, the generators coincide everywhere. Consequently
the groups coincide, for both arise by exponentiating the same self-adjoint generator.

The proof of parts (b), (c) rely on the following lemma, itself a consequence of (a).
We state it aside given its technical usefulness.

11.5.3
The Theorems of Stone–von Neumann and Mackey
Weyl’s relations are valid for bounded operators W((t, u)), (t, u) ∈R2n, that form
an irreducible set on a complex Hilbert space H, and imply that s →W(s(t, u))
are strongly continuous at s = 0. We intend to show how they force H to become
isomorphicto L2(Rn, dx)undertheidentiﬁcationsending W((t, u))toei
k tk Xk+uk Pk.
In particular, the Hilbert space H turns out to be separable.
The theorem will be stated in a slightly more general form, for which we shall
need symplectic geometry.
Let us recall some facts about symplectic vector spaces.
Deﬁnition 11.41 A pair (X, σ) is called a (real) symplectic vector space if X is
a real vector space and the symplectic form σ : X × X →R is a bilinear, skew-
symmetric and weakly non-degenerate map: σ(u, v) = 0 ∀u ∈X ⇒v = 0.
If (Y, τ) is another symplectic vector space, we call a linear map f : X →Y
a symplectic linear map if it preserves the symplectic forms: τ( f (x), f (y)) =
σ(x, y), x, y ∈X.
A symplectomorphism is a bijective symplectic linear map.
Note that any symplectic linear map f : X →Y is one-to-one (see Exercise 11.6),
so the image ( f (X), τ) is a symplectic subspace of (Y, τ) isomorphic to (X, σ). If
X is a normed space (inﬁnite-dimensional), there exists a stronger concept of non-
degeneracy: it requires (a) σ(·, v) ∈X′ for any v ∈X, and (b) X ∋v →σ(·, v) ∈X′
is bijective (where X′ denotes the topological dual of X). In ﬁnite dimension weak
non-degeneracy is the same as this strong non-degeneracy.
The next result is due to Darboux (and is related to a more famous theorem on
symplectic manifolds, which we shall not be concerned about [FaMa06]).

Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
Theorem 11.42 (Darboux)If(X, σ)isa(real)symplecticvectorspacewithdim X =
2n ﬁnite, there exists a basis (inﬁnitely many, actually), called standard symplectic
basis, {e1, · · · , en, f1, · · · , fn} ⊂X, in which σ assumes the following canonical
form:

It is not hard to prove that an automorphism of a symplectic vector space is a sym-
plectomorphism if and only if it preserves Darboux bases.
Now we can state the Stone–von Neumann theorem, whose proof is postponed to
after we have introduced Weyl ∗-algebras. In a dedicated section ensuing the proof
we will comment on the mathematics and the physics of the theorem.
Theorem 11.43 (Stone–vonNeumann)LetHbeacomplexnon-trivialHilbertspace
and (X, σ) a real 2n-dimensional symplectic vector space. Suppose H admits a family
of operators {W(z)}z∈X ⊂B(H) with the following properties:
(a) H is irreducible under {W(z)}z∈X;
(b) the Weyl relations
W(z)W(z′) = e−i
2 σ(z,z′)W((z + z′)) ,
W(z)∗= W(−z) ,
z, z′ ∈X
(11.57)
hold;
(c) for given z ∈X, every mapping R ∋s →W(sz) satisﬁes
s- lim
s→0 W(sz) = W(0) .
(11.58)
Then, in a given standard symplectic basis of X for which z ∈X is determined by
(t(z), u(z)) ∈Rn×Rn, there exists a Hilbert space isomorphism S : H →L2(Rn, dx)
such that:
S W(z) S−1 := exp

⎨
⎩i


k=1

⎬
⎭,
for any z ∈X.
(11.59)
where the symmetric operators Xi, Pi are as of Proposition11.39.
Consequently H must be necessarily separable, as L2(Rn, dx) is.
To complement the Stone–von Neumann theorem we state immediately another
result, proved by Mackey, that treats reducible representations of the Weyl ∗-algebra.
The notion of Hilbert sum used below is the one found in Deﬁnition3.67.
Theorem 11.44 (Mackey)AssumethehypothesesofTheorem11.43,with(a)replaced
by one of the following equivalent facts.
(a1) Every generator W(z), z ∈X, has trivial kernel.

11.5 Weyl’s Relations, the Theorems of Stone–von Neumann and Mackey
641
(a2) Every generator W(z) is unitary.
(a3) W(0) is the identity operator on H.
Then the Hilbert space H is the Hilbert sum of a family (at most countable if H is
separable) of closed, irreducible and W(z)-invariant subspaces. On each such com-
ponent the Stone–von Neumann theorem holds with respect to the restricted operators
W(z).
With the Darboux theorem in mind, an alternative way to formulate the Stone–
von Neumann theorem, more often encountered in the literature, goes as follows.
Mackey’s theorem has a similar reformulation as well, which we omit but the reader
can easily reconstruct.
Theorem 11.45 (Alternative version of the Stone–von Neumann theorem) Let H be
a complex non-trivial Hilbert space and suppose {U(t)}t∈Rn, {V (u)}u∈Rn ⊂B(H)
satisfy the following properties.
(a) H is irreducible under {U(t)}t∈Rn ∪{V (u)}u∈Rn.
(b) The relations (also called Weyl relations):
U(t)V (u) = V (u)U(t)eit·u ,
t, u ∈Rn,
U(t)U(t′) = U(t + t′),
V (u)V (u) = V (u + u′),
U(t)∗= U(−t),
V (u)∗= V (−u)
hold for all t, u, t′u′ ∈Rn.
(c) For any pair t ∈Rn, u ∈Rn:
s- lim
s→0 U(st) = U(0) and s- lim
s→0 V (su) = V (0) .
(11.60)
Then there there exists an isomorphism S1 : H →L2(Rn, dx) such that:
S1 U(t) S−1

where the symmetric operators Xi, Pi are deﬁned as in Proposition11.39.
Let us explain how the two versions are equivalent. Assume the Hilbert spaces H
of the statements are the same. We begin by proving that Theorems11.43 implies
11.45. From the hypotheses of Theorem11.45 and its Weyl relations it is immediate
to see that the W((t, u)) := eit·u/2U(t)V (u) fulﬁl Theorem11.43 over the symplectic
vector space (Rn × Rn, σc), where σc is the symplectic form already in canonical
form:
σc((t, u), (t′, u′)) =

in the standard basis of Rn ×Rn. If we choose the symplectic basis to be the standard
one on Rn × Rn, then Theorem11.43 implies Theorem11.45 by taking S1 = S.

642
11
Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
So let us prove Theorems 11.45 implies 11.43. Choose a standard symplectic basis
on X and identify elements in X with pairs (t, u) in Rn × Rn. If the W((t, u)) satisfy
Theorem11.43, then the new operators V (t) := W((t, 0)) and U(u) := W((0, u))
fulﬁl Theorem11.45. A direct computation shows 11.45 implies Theorem11.43 for
S = S1.
Remarks 11.46 Referring to Deﬁnition11.11, we can give here an elementary exam-
ple of complete set of commuting observables and von Neumann algebra of observ-
ables RS for a quantum particle without spin. As we know HS = L2(R3, d3x). A
complete set of commuting observables is the set of the three position operators
A1 = {X1, X2, X3} or the set of the three momenta A2 = {P1, P2, P3}. We leave
the elementary proof to the reader. The algebra RS must contain at least the von
Neumann algebra generated by A1 ∪A2. We conclude that all self-adjoint opera-
tors Xk and Pk are afﬁliated to RS (Proposition11.8) and therefore RS contains all
bounded functions of these operators and linear combinations of these functions. In
particular it must contain the operators U(t) and V (u) and so the whole Weyl alge-
bra generated. The commutant of RS is consequently trivial, as it contains a unitary
irreducible representation of the Weyl algebra, in view of the ﬁrst part of Stone–von
Neumann theorem. We conclude that RS = B(HS).
■
11.5.4
The Weyl ∗-Algebra
The statement of the Stone–von Neumann theorem contains an extremely important
notion, both for the proof but also in view of developing QM towards Quantum Field
Theory. We are talking about Weyl ∗-algebras. Let us spend some time on this.
Deﬁnition 11.47 Let X be a real non-trivial vector space of arbitrary dimension
(possibly inﬁnite) and σ : X × X →R a symplectic form on it.
A ∗-algebra W (X, σ) is called Weyl ∗-algebra of (X, σ) if there exists a family
{W(u)}u∈X of non-zero elements, called generators , such that:
(i) Weyl’s (commutation) relations:
W(u)W(v) = e−i
2 σ(u,v)W(u + v) ,
W(u)∗= W(−u) ,
u, v ∈X
(11.61)
hold;
(ii) W (X, σ) is generated by {W(u)}u∈X, i.e. W (X, σ) is the linear span of ﬁnite
combinations of ﬁnite products of {W(u)}u∈X.
What we show now, amongst other things, is that a symplectic vector space (X, σ)
determines a unique Weyl ∗-algebra up to ∗-isomorphisms.
Theorem 11.48 Let X be a non-trivial real vector space of arbitrary dimension
(possibly inﬁnite) and σ : X × X →R a symplectic form.

11.5 Weyl’s Relations, the Theorems of Stone–von Neumann and Mackey
643
(a) There exists, always, a Weyl ∗-algebra W (X, σ) associated to (X, σ).
(b) Any Weyl ∗-algebra W (X, σ) has a unit I, and:
W(0) = I ,
W(u)∗= W(−u) = W(u)−1 , u ∈X.
(11.62)
The generators {W(u)}u∈X are linearly independent, so in particular W(u) ̸= W(v)
if u ̸= v.
(c) If W (X, σ), generated by {W(u)}u∈X, and W ′(X, σ), generated by {W ′(u)}u∈X,
are Weyl ∗-algebras of (X, σ), there is a unique ∗-isomorphism α : W (X, σ) →
W ′(X, σ), which is determined by imposing:
α(W(u)) = W ′(u) ,
for any u ∈X.
(d) Every representation of W (X, σ) on a Hilbert space H ̸= {0}
π : W (X, σ) →B(H)
is faithful.
(e) Let W (X′, σ ′) be a Weyl ∗-algebra of the symplectic vector space (X′, σ ′).
If f
: X →X′ is a symplectic linear map, there exists a ∗-homomorphism
(∗-isomorphism if f is a symplectomorphism) α f : W (X, σ) →W (X′, σ ′) that
is completely determined by:
α f (W(u)) = W ′( f (u)) ,
u ∈X
(11.63)
(with obvious notation). Furthermore, α f is injective.
Proof (a) Consider the Hilbert space H := L2(X, μ) where μ is the counting
measure of the set X. With u ∈X consider W(u) ∈B(L2(X, μ)) deﬁned by
(W(u)ψ)(v) := eiσ(u,v)/2ψ(u + v) for any ψ ∈L2(X, μ), v ∈X. It is immediate
that such operators are non-null and satisfy Weyl’s commutation relations (11.62),
by using Hermitian conjugation as involution. Finite combinations of ﬁnite products
form a Weyl ∗-algebra of (X, σ).
(b) From the ﬁrst equation in (11.61) we have W(u)W(0) = W(0) = W(0)W(u)
and W(u)W(−u) = W(0) = W(−u)W(u), because the W(u) do not vanish and
generate the whole ∗-algebra. Hence W(0) = I and W(−u) = W(u)−1. The latter,
bearing in mind the second equation in (11.61), implies W(u)∗= W(u)−1. Now
let us prove the generators’ linear independence. Consider a subset of n generators
{W(u j)} j=1,...,n, with u1, . . . , un all distinct, and let us show the W(u j) are indepen-
dent. Over arbitrary subsets (and ﬁnite combinations) the claim is proved. Consider
the null combination n
j=1 a jW(u j) = 0 and let us prove, by induction, a j = 0
for j = 1, . . . , n. If n = 1 this is true as every W(u) is non-null by deﬁnition.
Suppose the claim holds for n −1 generators, however chosen, and let us prove the
assertion for n. Without loss of generality (relabelling if necessary) we may assume,
by contradiction, an ̸= 0. Then n
j=1 a jW(u j) = 0 implies

an e−iσ(−un,u j)/2. To prove the claim it sufﬁces to show b j = 0 for


j=1
b je−iσ(u,u j−un)W(u j) .
As the generators W(u j), j = 1, 2, . . . , n −1, are linearly independent, we have
b j(1−e−iσ(u,u j−un)) = 0. If b j ̸= 0 for some j then we would have 1 = e−iσ(u,u j−un),
and so σ(u,u j−un)
2π
= k(u) ∈Z. But the left-hand side is linear in u ∈X, so the map-
ping X ∋u →k(u) must be linear. Being Z-valued it is the zero map. Therefore
σ(u, u j −un) = 0 for any u ∈X. The non-degeneracy of σ implies u j = un for
j < n, an absurd.
(c) The Weyl generators are linearly independent, and the product of two is a
complex multiple of a generator (by the ﬁrst Weyl identity), whence genera-
tors form a vector basis for the Weyl ∗-algebra. Consider the unique linear map
α : W (X, σ) →W ′(X, σ) deﬁned by α(W(u)) = W ′(u) for any u ∈X. As
{W(u)}u∈X and {W ′(u)}u∈X are bases of the corresponding ∗-algebras, α is a vector-
space isomorphism. But products of elements of the two ∗-algebras are combinations
of the generators, by the ﬁrst set of Weyl relations (the same for both ∗-algebras), so

11.5 Weyl’s Relations, the Theorems of Stone–von Neumann and Mackey
645
α must preserve products. Moreover, α(W(0)) = W ′(0) implies that α preserves the
multiplicative unit. Eventually α(W(−u)) = W ′(−u) and the second Weyl set imply
α commutes with involutions as well. The procedure also shows that α is uniquely
determined by ﬁxing α(W(u)) = W ′(u) for every u ∈X.
(d) Consider a representation π : W (X, σ) →B(H). By construction the operators
{π(W(u))}u∈X satisfy Weyl’s relations. If every π(W(u)) is non-null, they deﬁne
a Weyl ∗-algebra of (X, σ). By part (c) the representation π, when the codomain
restricts to π(W (X, σ)), is a ∗-isomorphism, making π injective. If, on the contrary,
π(W(u)) = 0 for some u ∈X, then π is the zero representation. That is because
if z ∈X, setting z −u =: v implies π(W(z)) = e
i
2 σ(u,v)π(W(u))π(W(v)) =
e
i
2 σ(u,v)0π(W(v)) = 0 by Weyl’s relations. Hence π is null as the W(v) form a basis
for W (X, σ). Since the Weyl algebra is a unital ∗-algebra and H ̸= {0}, the zero
representation is not admitted Remarks3.35(3)).
(e) As the generators of the Weyl ∗-algebra form a basis, as we said in (c), there is
one and only one linear map α f : W (X, σ) →W (X′, σ ′), completely determined
by (11.63). Using the Weyl relations, and recalling f preserves symplectic forms, we
obtain α f is a ∗-homomorphism. Its uniqueness is clear, since any ∗-homomorphism
is linear, and (11.63) determine α f for they ﬁx its values on given bases. Injectivity
goes like this: if α(
i aiW(ui)) = 0 (summing over an arbitrary, ﬁnite, set) then

i aiα(W(ui)) = 0, i.e. 
i aiW ′( f (ui)) = 0, where f (ui) ̸= f (u j) for i ̸= j as
f is one-to-one (σ ′ is weakly non-degenerate). Since the W ′(u′) are linearly inde-
pendent, ai = 0 for every i and α(
i aiW(ui)) = 0 implies 
i aiW(ui), as we
wanted.
□
Remarks 11.49 (1) In the sense of (a), (c) above, the pair (X, σ) and Eq.(11.61)
determine the Weyl ∗-algebra W (X, σ) of (X, σ) universally (up to ∗-isomorphisms).
Any concrete Weyl ∗-algebra of (X, σ) made of operators in B(H), for a complex
Hilbert space H ̸= {0} and where the involution is the Hermitian conjugation, is
sometimes called a realisation of the Weyl ∗-algebra of (X, σ). In other words, in
view of Theorem11.48(c), a realisation of the Weyl ∗-algebra of (X, σ) over H is
an injective linear map φ : W (X, σ) →B(H) which preserves the product and the
involution, and maps W(0) to an operator φ(W(0)) that deﬁnes the identity element
on the image of φ. In formulas, φ(W(u))φ(W(0)) = φ(W(0))φ(W(u)) = φ(W(u))
for every u ∈X. We henceforth use the notation WH(u) := φ(W(u)).
(2) If φ : W (X, σ) →B(H) is a realisation of W (X, σ) over H, it is in general false
that the identity operator I : H →H coincides with the neutral element WH(0) of
the ∗-algebra WH(X, σ) := φ(W (X, σ)), though this unital ∗-algebra is isomorphic
to W (X, σ).
Let us show a simple counterexample. Start from a realisation of W (X, σ) on a
Hilbert space (H, (·|·)) such that WH(0) = I and consider the Hilbert space H′ :=
H ⊕C with product ⟨(ψ, z)|(ψ′, z′)⟩= (ψ|ψ′) + zz. A realisation of W (X, σ) is
the unique ∗-isomorphism φ from W (X, σ) to the ∗-algebra WH′(X, σ) ⊂B(H′)
generated by the operators WH′(u) := WH(u)⊕0, and such that φ(W(u)) = WH′(u)
for every u ∈X. In this case WH′(0) is not the identity on H′, but just the orthogonal
projector onto H viewed as closed subspace of H′.

11
Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
As established in Proposition3.55, this annoying possibility is just due to the fact
that φ is not a representation of unital ∗-algebras. If, conversely, φ is a representation,
then WH(0) is the identity on H just because this is a requirement in the very deﬁnition
of ∗-algebrarepresentation(Deﬁnition3.52).Animportantcasearetheso-calledGNS
representations, that we will encounter later. They are fundamental in formulations
of Quantum Field Theories.
We ﬁnally observe that for a Hilbert space realisation, WH(0) = I (the realisation
is a faithful representation) is equivalent to saying that all operators WH(u) are
unitary, because WH(u)WH(u)∗= WH(u)∗WH(u) = WH(0).
(3) If φ : W (V, σ) →B(H) is a realisation on the Hilbert space H ̸= {0} of the
Weyl ∗-algebra of (V, σ) and H is irreducible under the generating set {WH(u)}u∈V,
then WH(0) = I and hence the WH(u) are unitary.
Here is the proof. Note WH(u) ̸= 0, for some u ∈V, for otherwise the set of
operators W(u) would act reducibly. Since WH(u)WH(0) = WH(u) = WH(0)WH(u),
WH(0) is an orthogonal projector that commutes with every WH(u), so irreducibility
forces WH(0) = I or WH(0) = 0. The latter is impossible because it would imply
WH(u) = WH(u + 0) = WH(u)WH(0) = 0 for every u ∈V.
(4) If φ : W (V, σ) →B(H) is a realisation on the Hilbert space H ̸= {0} of the
Weyl ∗-algebra of (V, σ), then WH(0) = I and the WH(u) are unitary precisely when
each generator WH(u) has trivial kernel {0}.
The proof is straightforward. If every WH(u) has trivial null space, the orthogonal
projector WH(0) has trivial kernel and must coincide with the projector I. Conversely
if WH(0) = I then the WH(u) are unitary, hence their null spaces are trivial.
(5) The Weyl ∗-algebra W (V, σ) of a symplectic vector space (V, σ) admits a norm
rendering its Banach completion a unital C∗-algebra: this is the Weyl C∗-algebra of
(V, σ). Take, for example, the closure of the realisation of (V, σ) on B(L2(X, μ))
described in the proof of Theorem11.48(a). The important fact, proved in Chap.14,
is that this C∗-algebra is determined by (V, σ), for one can prove there is a unique
norm on a Weyl ∗-algebra satisfying the C∗-identity ||a∗a|| = ||a||2. Moreover, the
∗-isomorphism of Theorem11.48(c) extends to an (isometric) ∗-isomorphism of the
C∗-algebras. Weyl C∗-algebras are but one starting point to build the quantum theory
of bosonic ﬁelds [BrRo02]. See [Str05a] for examples of (Weyl) C∗-algebras used
in QM.

Proof of the Theorems of Stone–von Neumann and
Mackey
In this section we prove the Stone–von Neumann theorem as given by 11.43, and
then Mackey’s Theorem11.44. Part of the arguments are a mere reworking of what
is found in [Str05a].

11.5 Weyl’s Relations, the Theorems of Stone–von Neumann and Mackey
647
Proof of theorem 11.43 (Stone–von Neumann) Begin by observing that every operator
W(z) ∈B(H) is non-zero: for if W(z0) = 0, for every z ∈X with z −z0 =: v,
we would have W(z) = e
i
2 σ(z0,v)W(z0)W(v) = e
i
2 σ(z0,v)0W(v) = 0. Then H would
not be irreducible under the entire family W(z) ∈B(H). By Deﬁnition11.47, the
set of W(z) ∈B(H) is a generating system for the realisation of the Weyl ∗-algebra
W (X, σ) of the symplectic vector space (X, σ). This is given by ﬁnite combinations
of ﬁnite products of the W(z), and realised as the image of an irreducible faithful
representation π : W (X, σ) →B(H) of (X, σ) (notice that irreducibility forces
W(0) = I by Remark11.49(3)).
Fix a basis in X, so to associate bijectively every z ∈X to its components
(t(z), u(z)) ∈Rn × Rn. Consider the Hilbert space L2(Rn, dx). The family of non-
null (unitary) operators

corresponding faithful representation Π : W (X, σ) →B(L2(Rn, dx)). We denote
by az ∈W (X, σ) the generators of W (X, σ), so that π(az) = W(z) and also
Π(az) = exp

for any z ∈X.
Suppose now there are two non-zero vectors Φ0 ∈H, Ψ0 ∈L2(Rn, dx) such that:
(i) D := π(W (X, σ))Φ0 is dense in H, (ii) D1 := Π(W (X, σ))Ψ0 is dense in
L2(Rn, dx), and (iii):
(Φ0 |π(a)Φ0 ) = (Ψ0 |Π(a)Ψ0 ) ,
a ∈W (X, σ).
(11.64)
Let us show that, consequently, there is a linear map *S : D →D1
*Sπ(a)Φ0 = Π(a)Ψ0 ,
a ∈W (X, σ),
(11.65)
extending by continuity to a Hilbert isomorphism H →L2(Rn, dx) satisfying
(11.59), and hence proving the theorem.
The mapping is well deﬁned: suppose π(a)Φ0 = π(b)Φ0. For (11.65) to be well
deﬁned we must have Π(a)Ψ0 = Π(b)Ψ0. From π(a)Φ0 = π(b)Φ0 follows, for
any c ∈W (X, σ):
(π(c)Φ0|π(a)Φ0) = (π(c)Φ0|π(b)Φ0) .
Since π is a representation of ∗-algebras, so π(c∗) = π(c)∗and π( f )π(d) = π( f d),
the displayed equation is equivalent to

Φ0|π(c∗a)Φ0

=

Φ0|π(c∗b)Φ0

648
11
Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
and by (11.64) we have (Ψ0|Π(c∗a)Ψ0) = (Ψ0|Π(c∗b)Ψ0). Proceeding backwards,
for any c ∈W (X, σ):
(Π(c)Ψ0|Π(a)Ψ0) = (Π(c)Ψ0|Π(b)Ψ0) .
As Π(c)Ψ0 roams the dense space D1, necessarily Π(a)Ψ0 = Π(b)Ψ0, as required.
Therefore *S in (11.65) is well deﬁned. It is immediate to see that *S is linear, for
π, Π are representations. By construction *S preserves the inner product, and so is
isometric:

By Proposition2.47 we can extend, by linearity and continuity, the transformation
*S from the dense domain D to the Hilbert space, obtaining a linear map S : H →
L2(Rn, dx). The extension S stays isometric by inner product’s continuity. Similarly,
we can construct, ﬁrst on the dense space D1, then on L2(Rn, dx), a linear isometry
S′ : L2(Rn, dx) →H by extending
*S′Π(a)Ψ0 = π(a)Φ0
for any a ∈W (X, σ).
(11.66)
Since *S*S′ = ID1, *S′*S = ID on the dense spaces D1, D, these are valid by continuity
on the extended domains: SS′ = IL2(Rn,dx), S′S = IH. Overall, S : H →L2(Rn, dx)
is a Hilbert isomorphism satisfying
Sπ(a)Φ0 = Π(a)Ψ0
for any a ∈W (X, σ).
(11.67)
Invert the identity for b ∈W (X, σ) to obtain π(b)Φ0 = S−1Π(b)Ψ0. Substituting
in (11.67), and replacing π(a) by π(ab) = π(a)π(b) on the left and Π(a) by
Π(ab) = Π(a)Π(b) on the right, ﬁnally produces:
Sπ(a)S−1 Π(b)Ψ0 = Π(a) Π(b)Ψ0 .
The vectors Π(b)Ψ0 deﬁne a dense space in L2(Rn, dx), so
Sπ(a)S−1 = Π(a) for any a ∈W (X, σ) .
Picking as a ∈W (X, σ) a generic Weyl generator transforms the identity into
(11.59).
To end the proof we have to exhibit vectors Φ0, Ψ0 satisfying (11.64) and gen-
erating, under the respective representations, dense subspaces. Let Φ0 ∈H be any
non-zero vector. The closed space π(W (X, σ))Φ0 is invariant under any π(a), and

11.5 Weyl’s Relations, the Theorems of Stone–von Neumann and Mackey

in particular under any π(W(z)), by construction. Since H is irreducible under these
vectors, then π(W (X, σ))Φ0 = H, i.e. D := π(W (X, σ))Φ0 is dense in H. A simi-
lar argument says D1 := Π(W (X, σ))Ψ0 is dense in L2(Rn, dx) for every non-zero
Ψ0 ∈L2(Rn, dx). There remains to determine Φ0, Ψ0 fulﬁlling (11.64). Consider in
L2(Rn, dx) the vector
Ψ0(x) = ψ0(x1) · · · ψ0(xn) = π−n/4e−|x|2/2
where ψ0 is the ﬁrst Hermite function. A straightforward calculation based on

(11.68)
If we manage to ﬁnd a vector Φ0 ∈H such that
(Φ0 |W(z) Φ0) = e−(|t(z)|2+|u(z)|2)/4 ,
for any z ∈X,
(11.69)
then (11.64) holds by linearity, as any Π(a) is a combination of elements Π(az) and
the corresponding π(a) is a combination (same coefﬁcients) of elements π(az). At
this point the existence of Φ0 is warranted by the next proposition.
Proposition 11.50 Under the assumptions of Theorem11.43, if a (standard sym-
plectic) basis on X has been ﬁxed so to map every z ∈X to its components
(t(z), u(z)) ∈Rn × Rn, there exists Φ0 ∈H satisfying (11.69).
Proof First, the operators W(z) are unitary with W(0) = I, by Remark11.49(3) and
because H is W(z)-irreducible. We claim X ∋z →W(z) is continuous in the strong
topology (the regularity assumption s-lims→0 W(sz) = W(0) = I is only appar-
ently weaker than strong continuity at z = 0, since the limit might not be uniform
along directions tending to the origin). Set W((t(z), u(z))) := W(z) in the sequel. Let
us begin by proving Rn ∋t →W((t, 0)) and Rn ∋u →W((0, t)) are strongly
continuous. We will prove it for Rn ∋t →W((t, 0)) only, as the other case is
identical. Weyl’s relations imply additivity: W((t, 0))W((t′, 0)) = W((t + t′, 0)). If
e1, . . . , en are the basis vectors expressing t = n
k=1 tkek we can write W((t, 0)) =
W((t1e1, 0)) · · · W((tnen, 0)). Each map R ∋tk →W((tkek, 0)) is strongly contin-
uous by regularity, i.e. s-lims→0 W(sz) = W(0) = I in Theorem11.43. Take ψ ∈H
and let us show ||W((t, 0))ψ −ψ|| →0 as t →0. We have

Since the map is continuous it must vanish everywhere, so W(z) = 0. As earlier said
this cannot be. To ﬁnish the proof we need to justify:
PW(z)P = e−|z|2/4P .
(11.71)
Indeed, choosing z = 0 in (11.71) gives PP = P, making P a non-null orthogonal
projector. If Φ0 ∈P(H) \ {0} with ||Φ0|| = 1, as PΦ0 = Φ0, Eq.(11.71) implies,
for any z ∈X
(Φ0|W(z)Φ0) = e−|z|2/4 = e−(|t(z)|2+|u(z)|2)/4 .
Hence our Φ0 satisﬁes (11.69), as requested.

This concludes the proof of Theorem11.43 (Stone–von Neumann). □
Proof of theorem 11.44 (Mackey). The hypotheses (a1), (a2), (a3) are equivalent
because of Remark11.49(3), (4). With those assumptions the W(z) are unitary, with
W(0) = I. Then we can go through the proof of Proposition11.50 – which only used
that the W(z) were unitary with W(0) = I, and did not rely on the representation’s
irreducibility – and build the orthogonal projector P ̸= 0:

as we have seen. First consider the closed space H0 := < {W(z)P(H)}z∈X > proving
that H0 = H. By construction H0 is invariant under W(z). Then H⊥
0 is also invariant. If

To conclude, take a Hilbert basis {Φk}k∈I of P(H) and consider the closed spaces
Hk := < {W(z)Φk}z∈X > invariant under W(z). Notice Φk ∈Hk, since W(0) = I,
so Hk ̸= {0} for any k ∈I. By (11.71):
(Φ j|W(z)Φk) = (Φ j|PW(z)PΦk) = e−|z|2/4(Φ j|PΦk) = 0 if j ̸= k .
We have found closed subspaces H j ̸= {0} that are mutually orthogonal (in particular
j varies in a countable set if H is separable). By construction, as
< {W(z)P(H)}z∈X > = H
and {Φk}k∈I is a basis in P(H), the space of ﬁnite combinations of vectors in the
mutually orthogonal Hk is dense in H. Therefore H is the Hilbert sum ⊕k∈IHk of the
closed spaces Hk, k ∈I (Deﬁnition3.67). To ﬁnish, on every Hk we can replicate
the proof of Stone–von Neumann with H replaced by Hk and π : W (X, σ) →B(H)
replaced by πk : W (X, σ) →B(Hk), restriction of the image of each operator
in π(W (X, σ)) to Hk. The only difference is that now πk(W (X, σ))Φk is dense
in Hk by assumption, whereas in the theorem it descends from the irreducibility
of πk(W (X, σ)). Therefore the restriction πk(W (X, σ)) of π(W (X, σ)) to Hk is
isomorphic – under a suitable Hilbert space isomorphism Sk : Hk →L2(Rn, dx) –
to the standard representation Π of the Weyl algebra on L2(Rn, dx) such that
Skπk(a)S−1
k
= Π(a) ,
∀a ∈W (X, σ) .
As Π is irreducible, so must be every πk. This ends the proof.

More on “Heisenberg’s Principle”: Weakening the
Assumptions and the Extension to Mixed States
The formalism developed to prove the Stone–von Neumann theorem allows to gen-
eralise Theorem11.33, i.e. Heisenberg’s principle, by taking weaker assumptions

on the set to which ψ belongs (the existence of (Xi)ψ, (Pj)ψ sufﬁces). It also
enables to extend it to cover mixed states. Let us begin with a technical lemma.
Lemma 11.51 Let Xi, Pj be the position and momentum operators of axiom A5, and
deﬁne X′
i := Xi + ai I, P′
j := Pj + b j I, with ai, b j ∈R. If ψ, φ ∈D(Xi) ∩D(Pj)
then the CCRs
(X′
iψ|P′
jϕ) −(P′
jψ|X′
iϕ) = iℏδi j(ψ|ϕ)
(11.73)
hold, here written using quadratic forms.
Proof Notice D(Xi) = D(X′
i), D(Pj) = D(P′
j). In case ai, b j = 0, consider
(11.35), so
(W((−t, 0))ψ |W((0, u))ϕ ) −(W((0, −u))ψ |W((t, 0))ϕ )
= (1 −e−i(t·u)/2) (W((−t, 0))ψ |W((0, u))ϕ ) .
Using Stone’s theorem (X′
iψ|P′
jϕ) −(P′
jψ|X′
iϕ) = iℏδi j(ψ|ϕ). Add ai I and b j I to
the operators inside the inner products on the left. Since the Xi, Pj are Hermitian,
the terms on the right cancel out, yielding (11.73) in the general case. □
Theorem 11.52 Let Xi and Pj be the position and momentum operators of axiom
A5. If the unit vector ψ ∈HS is such that (Xi)ψ and (Pi)ψ exist, then Heisen-
berg’s principle holds:
(Xi)ψ(Pi)ψ ≥ℏ/2 .
Proof By part (i) in Proposition11.27(a) if (Xi)ψ and (Pi)ψ are deﬁned then
ψ ∈D(Xi) ∩D(Pi). Referring to Lemma11.51 we choose ai = −(ψ|Xiψ), b j =
−(ψ|Piψ). By deﬁnition of standard deviation (11.11) and Theorem9.4(f) we have
(Xi)2
ψ =

(λ −ai)2dμ(A)
ψ (λ) = ||X′
iψ||2. Similarly, ||P′
i ψ||2 = (Pi)2
ψ. On the
other hand (for any ai, bi) from (11.73) we infer:
||X′
iψ||||P′
i ψ|| ≥|(X′
iψ|P′
i ψ)| ≥|Im(X′
iψ|P′
i ψ)| = ℏ
2 .
(11.74)
Since (Xi)ψ(Pi)ψ = ||X′
iψ||||P′
i ψ||, the claim is proved.
□
So now we can extend “Heisenberg’s principle” to mixed states as well.
Theorem 11.53 Let Xi and Pj be the position and momentum operators of axiom
A5. If ρ is a mixed state for the spinless particle such that (Xi)ρ and (Pi)ρ exist,
then:
(Xi)ρ(Pi)ρ ≥ℏ
2 .
Proof Let us notice, preliminarily, that if (Xi)ρ and (Pi)ρ can be deﬁned, then
also ⟨(Xi)k⟩ρ and ⟨(Pi)k⟩ρ, k = 0, 1, 2, are deﬁned, as is easy to see using Deﬁn-
ition11.25, because measures are ﬁnite. Furthermore, Ran(ρ) ⊂D(Xi) ∩D(Pi)

by (ii) in Proposition11.27(b), as Ran(ρ1/2) ⊃Ran(ρ). Set X′
i := Xi + ai I,
P′
i := Pi + bi I, and choose ai := −⟨Xi⟩ρ, bi := −⟨Pi⟩ρ. A direct computation
relying on Deﬁnition11.25 tells that (Xi)2
ρ = ⟨(X′

ρ = ⟨(P′
i )2⟩ρ.
Write ρ = 
n pnψn(ψn| ) in a basis of unit eigenvectors. We argue as in Propo-
sition11.27 when we proved (11.19). As A = X′
i, P′
i and f (λ) = λ, and since
μ(A)
ρ (E) = tr(P(A)(E)ρ) = 
n pnμψn(E), using that pn ≥0 we can prove:

where ψn ∈D(X′
i) ∩D(P′
i ) = D(Xi) ∩D(Pi), because ψn ∈Ran(ρ) ⊂D(Xi) ∩
D(Pi). Therefore:

The Stone–von Neumann Theorem Revisited:
Weyl–Heisenberg Group
Our approach to the proof of Stone–von Neumann relies on the structure of (Weyl)
∗-algebra. There is, however, another point of view, due to Weyl, in which the Weyl–
Heisenberg group plays the algebra’s role. The Weyl–Heisenberg group in R2n+1,
which we shall indicate by H(n), is the simply connected Lie group diffeomorphic
to R2n+1 with product law
(η, t, u) ◦(η′, t′, u′) =

η + η′ + 1

iti , t + t′ , u + u′
	
(as usual t ∈Rn, u ∈Rn whilst η ∈R). A direct computation of its Lie algebra
shows there is a basis of 2n + 1 generators xi, pi, e, i = 1, 2, . . . , n that satisfy:
[xi, p j] = δi je ,
[xi, e] = [pi, e] = 0 ,
i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n .
The linear mapping determined by e →−i I, xk →−i Xk, pk →−i Pk is an
isomorphism from the Heisenberg Lie algebra to the Lie algebra of ﬁnite real com-
binations of the conjugate self-adjoint operators −i I, −i Xk, −i Pk, restricted to the
common, dense and invariant domain S (Rn), with commutator [·, ·] as Lie bracket.

Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
This map induces a Lie group isomorphism. By direct inspection, in fact, if the
operators W((t, u)) are deﬁned by Proposition11.39, the map
R2n+1 ∋(η, t, u) →eiηW((t, u)) =: H((η, t, u))
(11.75)
is an irreducible unitary representation of the (2n+1)-dimensional Weyl–Heisenberg
group on L2(Rn, dx) (not faithful since H(η, t, u) = H(η + 2kπ, t, u) if k ∈Z).
Moreover,
s- lim
s→0 H(s(η, t, u)) = I
for any given (η, t, u) ∈R2n+1 .
(11.76)
Conversely,
Proposition 11.54 An irreducible unitary representation of the Weyl–Heisenberg
group H(n) ∋(η, t, u) →H((η, t, u)) on the non-trivial complex Hilbert space H,
satisfying (11.76), has the form (11.75):
H((η, t, u)) = eicηW((t, u)) ,
where the W((t, u)) satisfy the Stone–von Neumann Theorem11.43 with σ replaced
by cσ and the constant c ∈R \ {0} is determined by H((1, 0, 0)) = eicI.
Representations H, H ′ over respective Hilbert spaces H, H′ with different values
of c are unitarily inequivalent: there is no unitary operator U : H →H′ such that
U H((η, t, u))U −1 = H ′((η, t, u)) for every (η, t, u) ∈H(n).
Proof The centre R of the Weyl–Heisenberg group is represented by a unitary
Abelian subgroup. As the elements of R commute with the Weyl–Heisenberg group,
every element H((η, 0, 0)) commutes with the whole representation. But the lat-
ter is irreducible, so Schur’s lemma forces H((η, 0, 0)) = χ(η)I, with χ(η) ∈C,
and |χ(η)| = 1 as H((η, 0, 0)) is unitary. Eventually, since η →H((η, 0, 0)) is
strongly continuous, Stone’s theorem implies χ(η) = eicη for every η ∈R and
some constant c so that H((1, 0, 0)) = eicI in particular. The group’s commuta-
tion rules require c ̸= 0, but also ensure that the W((t, u)) := e−icηH((η, t, u)) =
H((η, 0, 0))−1H((η, t, u)) = H((1, 0, 0))−1H((0, t, u)) obey Weyl’s relations as
in Theorem11.43 with σ replaced by cσ, the proof being elementary.
If H and H ′ are representations associated to constants c ̸= c′, there is no unitary
operator U such that U H(u)U −1 = H ′(u) for every u, because choosing u =
(η, 0, 0) we would ﬁnd eicη = eic′η for every η ∈R, which is impossible. □
The absolute value of the constant c equals Planck’s constant ℏ, as will become
evident in the next theorem. The fact that the sign of c can be reversed and we
still have a representation of the Weyl–Heisenberg group is related to the fact that
the operation of time reversal (xi →xi, pi →−pi) produces a representation of
the Weyl–Heisenberg group. In this framework we have an alternative statement of
Stone–von Neumann, ﬁrst proved by Weyl.

11.5 Weyl’s Relations, the Theorems of Stone–von Neumann and Mackey
657
Theorem 11.55 Every irreducible unitary representation of the Weyl–Heisenberg
group H(n) satisfying (11.76) is unitarily equivalent to the representation:
R2n+1 ∋(η, t, u) →eicηW((t, u))
on L2(Rn, dx), where the W((t, u)) are the operators of Proposition11.39 but the
Pk now are:
(Pkψ) (x) = −ic ∂ψ
∂xk
(x)
for some constant c ̸= 0.
Proof It is an immediate consequence of Proposition11.54 and the ﬁrst identity in
(11.35).
□
Remarks 11.56 (1)TheStone–vonNeumanntheoremprovesthatthenon-relativistic
elementary particle with spin 0 is described by an irreducible representation of a cer-
tain Lie group. The same happens for particles with spin, charge, etc., provided one
picks the right group. Elementary systems are therefore described by irreducible rep-
resentations of a group, which is typically related to the symmetries of the physical
system. This point of view has proved – thanks to Wigner in particular – incredibly
rewarding for the development of relativistic quantum theories, where irreducible
representations of the Poincaré group are employed to deﬁne elementary particles,
and irreducibility is a characteristic feature of elementary systems.
(2) There exist more or less rigorous formulations of the Stone–von Neumann theo-
rem that rely only on Heisenberg’s relations (11.28) and do not need exponentials.
To set up these formulations, though, the technical assumptions on domains (spaces
of analytic vectors) and on the existence of self-adjoint extensions are neither obvi-
ous, nor is their physical meaning straightforward. Beside the foundational work of
E. Nelson [Nel59], an important and thorough result is that of J. Dixmier [Dix56],
which we shall return to in the next chapter. In a nutshell, the theorem, generalised to
an arbitrary ﬁnite dimension, states that if P, Q are symmetric on a dense invariant
space on which Heisenberg’s relations hold, and on that same space P2 + Q2 is
essentially self-adjoint, then P, Q give a strongly continuous representation of the
Weyl algebra on the Hilbert space; hence, up to isomorphisms, P, Q have the usual
form on a (Hilbert sum of spaces) L2(R, dx).

11.5.8
Dirac’s Correspondence Principle, Weyl’s Calculus
and Deformation Quantisation
The formulation of QM we have presented leaves open the question of how to pick out
operators on H that correspond to observables of physical interest, other than posi-
tion and momentum. Several respected authors have written much about procedures
allowing to pass from relevant classical observables to major quantum observables.

658
11
Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
But that is somewhat like ﬁghting a losing battle: from a physical perspective Quan-
tum Mechanics is ‘more central’ than Classical Mechanics, whence the latter should
be seen as a limiting case of the former. Even this fact is by no means easy to prove,
apart in a few general cases: one such is Ehrenfest’s theorem, whose precise mathe-
matical formulation was found only recently [FrKo09]. Therefore one expects there
should be quantum entities, observables in particular, without classical counterparts
(for instance the “parity” of elementary particles, and in many respects also the spin).
That said, certain quantum observables for the spinless particle will, in principle,
be “functions” of the observables Xi, Pi. The common belief is that the quantum
quantity corresponding to the classical F(x, p) should look something like F(X, P).
But going down this road is a real challenge, more than what mathematics prospects,
as already partially discussed (see Sect.11.3.2). In fact: (1) is it not at all obvious
what meaning one should assign to a function of X and P when these operators have
non-commuting spectral measures (in the commuting case there are ways out that
use joint measures, like (11.3)); (2) naïve recipes in this direction do not produce
self-adjoint, not even symmetric, operators when the operators do not commute.
For the sake of clarity, let us consider the classical quantity x· p. Which observable
– i.e. self-adjoint operator – should it correspond to? Passing to the spectral measures
is ill-advised, because they do not commute. So let us try to use the operators them-
selves, restricted to an invariant and dense subspace where they are both deﬁned.
The hope is to produce an essentially self-adjoint operator, or at least symmetric, and
then in some way or another choose among its self-adjoint extensions (if any at all,
in case the operator is symmetric). The tentative answer:
“x · p corresponds to X · P(= n
i=1 Xi Pi)”
is totally inadequate, even if we view the operators on the invariant dense space
S (R3). That is because X · P is not symmetric on S (R3), for Xi and Pi do not
commute (exercise). Nor would it make sense to seek self-adjoint extensions of X · P.
Another possibility is to associate to x · p the symmetric operator (X · P + P · X)/2
deﬁned on S (R3), and study its self-adjoint extensions. When examining more
complicated situations, like x2
k pk, this recipe reveals itself very ambiguous, because
a priori there are several possibilities: (X2
k Pk + Pk X2
k)/2 is symmetric on the domain
S (R3), but also Xk(Xk Pk + Pk Xk)/4+(Xk Pk + Pk Xk)Xk/4 is, and there are others.
These choices correspond to “symmetrised” products, of sorts, of (non-commuting)
operators, that should produce an operator that is at least symmetric.
A criterion, helpful but not decisive to solve the issues raised, was found by
Dirac, and goes under the accepted name of “Dirac’s correspondence principle”. A
short but clear technical analysis of Dirac’s correspondence principle can be found
in [Str12]. Here we shall only consider some elementary issues. To present Dirac’s
correspondence principle, let us recall that a Lie algebra (V, [·, ·]) is a vector space
(here, over R) equipped with a skew-symmetric bilinear map [·, ·] : V × V →V,
called a Lie bracket, that satisﬁes the Jacobi identity:
[u, [v, w]] + [v, [w, u]] + [w, [u, v]] = 0 ,
for any u, v, w ∈V.

11.5 Weyl’s Relations, the Theorems of Stone–von Neumann and Mackey
659
In studying the phase space F of the classical particle (although the setup is fully
general), Dirac considered the real vector space G (F) of sufﬁciently regular maps
F →R with Poisson bracket:
{ f, g} :=

i
∂f
∂xi
∂g
∂pi
−∂g
∂xi
∂f
∂pi
,
f, g ∈G (F) .
He observed that (G (F), {·, ·}) is a Lie algebra. In particular the CCRs:
{xi, p j} = δi j
hold. These equations are Heisenberg’s relations once we substitute xi →Xi, pi →
Pi and {·, ·} →−iℏ−1[·, ·]. The idea behind “Dirac’s correspondence principle” is
the following.
Let ˆf denote the quantum analogue (an operator at least symmetric, and deﬁned
on a dense invariant domain, irrespective of the speciﬁc quantity) of the generic
classical quantity f ∈G (F). Under Dirac’s correspondence, if
h = { f, g}
for classical f, g, h ∈G (F), the corresponding ˆf , ˆg, ˆh in the quantum realm satisfy
ˆh = −iℏ−1[ ˆf , ˆg] .
Even though it is not very often declared explicitly, it is also assumed that the map
f →ˆf is linear and that the constant function 1 is mapped to the identity operator.
Just as an example, consider the usual classical particle. The components of the
classical angular momentum
li =


j,k=1

correspond to
Li =

Dirac’s principle could be explained for observables corresponding to the generators
of unitary transformations in a symmetry group of the system; these, though, do not
exhaust all possible observables (all this might be more enlightening after reading
the book’s ﬁnal three chapters). In that case it is only natural to request that (a) the
Lie algebra of the symmetry group, (b) the Lie algebra of the unitary representation
of transformations on the quantum system, and (c) the Lie algebra of generators of
the group of classical canonical transformations that correspond to symmetries of
the classical system, be all isomorphic.
Although we will not push the study any further, we have to mention that serious
technical hurdles crop up if one pursues Dirac’s idea literally. Suppose, in particular,
of working with polynomial functions of arbitrarily large degree in the canonical
variables xi, p j. Then [Stre07] it is not possible to deﬁne a “symmetrised prod-
uct” of self-adjoint operators corresponding to canonical variables (so to produce
operators that are at least symmetric) that does not depend on the degree and that
yields the isomorphism f →
ˆf . More generally, the Groenewold—van Hove
theorem establishes that the Lie algebra P of real polynomials in the variables
(x1, . . . , xn, p1, . . . , pn) ∈R2n equipped with the canonical Poisson bracket {·, ·}
has no quantisation map: this would be a linear map Q : h →ˆh from P to a vec-
tor space of symmetric operators deﬁned on a common invariant and dense domain
in some Hilbert space H, satisfying some natural requirements (for a survey see
[Got99]). In particular Q(1) = I and, obviously,
[Q( f ), Q(g)] = iℏQ({ f, g})
(11.77)
as assumed by Dirac’s correspondence principle.
In spite of the inherent difﬁculties of Dirac’s original principle, some of the under-
lying ideas have found a rigorous treatment within quantisation procedures called
Weyl quantisation or Weyl calculus (in particular see [Jef04], [ZFC05], [Gra04] and
[DA10]). The following formula, proved by Weyl and based on the Fourier transform,
tells how to associate to a function f = f (x1, . . . , xn, p1, . . . , pn) the operator
f (X1, . . . , Xn, P1, . . . , Pn)

This expression is a function of the operators X1, . . . , Xn, P1, . . . , Pn, *f is the
Fourier transform of f , and the integral is meant in the sense of Proposition9.31,

11.5 Weyl’s Relations, the Theorems of Stone–von Neumann and Mackey
661
assuming f is suitable, e.g. a Schwartz function on R2n. By using duality theorems
the deﬁnition extends to Schwartz distributions f , for which also polynomial func-
tions can be considered (see Sect.2 in [Jef04] for a brief and precise technical account
of Weyl calculus, and Chap.1 for other, related procedures). Weyl’s procedure does
provide operators that can be viewed as functions of the non-commuting Xk, Pk,
but still has problems. First of all, it maps real functions to self-adjoint operators,
but it does not preserve positivity (positive functions are not mapped, in general, to
positive operators). Furthermore, it maps the Poisson bracket of two polynomials to
the commutator of the corresponding functions of operators only if the polynomials
are at most quadratic.
Deformation quantisation [BFFL78] provides another interesting way out, and
of different nature. It keeps the space of classical observables P, but deforms the
classical commutative product · to a quantum noncommutative product ∗by means
of a (formal) power series in ℏof the form
f ∗g = f · g + ℏi{ f, g} + ℏ2G2( f, g) + · · · .
(11.78)
Within this picture Q( f ) = f , but condition (11.77) is weakened into
[Q( f ), Q(g)] = f ∗g −g ∗f = iℏQ({ f, g}) + O(ℏ2) ,
(11.79)
and the Groenewold–van Hove obstruction is avoided.
Remark 11.57 Expression (11.78) suggests that in the classical limit ℏ→0 the
quantum noncommutativity of observables disappears, but a relic of the noncommu-
tative structure survives in the classical Poisson structure.
■
In conclusion, despite interesting and remarkable technical attempts, the broad valid-
ity of Dirac’s correspondence principle is shaky. Its many snags are critical, appar-
ently inescapable and borne by the attempt to provide a serious framework to Dirac’s
original idea, even in its most rigorous versions such as Weyl’s calculus. That said,
the extension of Dirac’s idea to deformation quantisation seems to be very fruitful
also in Quantum Field Theory [BrFr09].

Mathematical Formulation of Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
Solution. As U A ⊂AU, taking adjoints gives A∗U ∗⊃U ∗A∗, since U ∗is a
generic unitary element of R′, and the thesis is proved.
11.3 Prove Proposition11.8.
Proposition. Let R be a von Neumann algebra over the complex Hilbert space H
and A : D(A) →H a closed operator with D(A) ⊂H dense. The following facts
are equivalent.
(a) AηR.
(b) If A = V P is the polar decomposition of A, then
(i) V ∈R,
(ii) PηR.
If A is self-adjoint, (a) and (b) are equivalent to
(c) the PVM of A satisﬁes P(A)
E
∈R for every Borel set E ⊂R.
If A ∈B(H), then (a) and (b) are equivalent to
(d) A ∈R.
Solution. (a) ⇔(b). If (a) holds, that is A = V P is afﬁliated to R, then U A = AU
for every U ∈R′ unitary. Taking adjoints gives A∗U ∗= U ∗A∗which, as R′ is ∗-
closed, means U A∗= A∗U for every U ∈R′ unitary. Consequently U A∗A =
U A∗U ∗U A = A∗AU. In other words U ∈R′ commutes with the operator A∗A
which is self-adjoint (Theorem10.36). Due to Theorem9.41(iii), U commutes with
the PVM of A∗A and with every function f (A∗A). In particular U commutes with
P =
√
A∗A, which is therefore afﬁliated to R. Notice that U P = PU implies in
particular that U(Ran(P)) ⊂Ran(P) and U(Ker(P)) ⊂Ker(P). From the polar
decomposition A = V P and from U A = AU we also have UV P = V PU, so
that UV P = VU P. This means UV x −VUx = 0 if x ∈Ran(P) and also x ∈
Ran(P) by continuity. However H = Ker(P) ⊕Ran(P) and Ker(P) = Ker(V )
(Theorem10.39(b) where V is called U). We conclude that UV −VU = 0 for
every U ∈R′. Let Q ∈R′ be an orthogonal projector. Then U := i Q −i(I −Q)
is unitary and belongs to R′. The condition UV = VU immediately produces
QV = V Q, so we conclude that V commutes with every orthogonal projector
of R′. Therefore, exploiting Proposition7.61 and the fact that S′′′ = S′′ we ﬁnd
V ∈(LR′(H))′ = (LR′(H))′′′ = (R′)′ = R. We have established (a) ⇒(b). If,
conversely, (b) is true and U ∈R′, then U A = UV P = VU P = V PU = AU, so
(b) ⇒(a).
(a) ⇔(c). Suppose that A = A∗. The operator A is afﬁliated to R iff U A = AU for
every U ∈R′. Theorem9.41(iii) guarantees that this is equivalent to the fact that the
PVMs of A and U commute. This concludes the proof that (a) ⇔(c).
(d) ⇔(a). If A ∈B(H), then A ∈R ⇒A is afﬁliated to R immediately. If A ∈B(H)
is afﬁliated to R, by decomposing A = B + iC with B, C ∈B(H) self-adjoint, and
using the fact that A∗is also afﬁliated to R, both B and C turn out to be afﬁliated
to R. Now (c) proves that the spectral measures of B, C belong to R. Since R is
closed in the strong operator topology, this entails that B, C (which are strong limits
of linear combinations of orthogonal projectors in R) stay in R. Hence A = B + iC
stays in R as well.

11.4 Prove that, if dim(H) = n < +∞, there are no operators A, B : H →H such
that [A, B] = cI for any c ∈C \ {0}. (Do not use Proposition11.32.)
Solution. If such operators A, B existed, one would have 0 = tr(AB)−tr(AB) =
tr(AB) −tr(B A) = tr([A, B]) = tr(cI) = nc.
11.5 Consider a particle moving on the real line, and suppose the pure state rep-

Hint. We refer to the proof of Theorem11.33, and note that we can have
(X)ψ(P)ψ = ℏ/2 only if ||X′ψ||||P′ψ|| = |(X′ψ|P′ψ)|, plus Re(X′ψ|P′ψ) =
0. The ﬁrst condition implies, by Proposition3.3(i), that X′ψ = cP′ψ for some
c ∈C. Since σp(X) = ∅and ψ ̸= 0, the second condition implies Re(c) = 0.
Solving the differential equation X′ψ = i Im(c)P′ψ, and using ||ψ|| = 1, leads to
the required expression for ψ.
11.6 Prove that a symplectic linear map f : (X, σ) →(X′, σ ′) is one-to-one.
Solution. Remember that symplectic forms are weakly non-degenerate, and
f (x) = 0 ⇒σ(y, x) = σ ′( f (y), 0) = 0 for any y ∈X so that x = 0.
11.7 Consider the Hilbert space H := L2([a, b], dx) and the self-adjoint operator
X on H deﬁned by (Xψ)(x) := xψ(x), for any ψ ∈H such that Xψ ∈H. Prove
there is no self-adjoint extension P of the symmetric operator −i d
dx , deﬁned on
the subspace of C1 maps either vanishing, or periodic, at the boundary of [a, b], so
that the one-parameter unitary groups U(u) := eiuX, V (v) := eivP satisfy Weyl’s
relations: U(u)V (v) = V (v)U(u)eiuv for any u, v ∈R.
Hint. First note that, trivially, V (sv),U(su) →I in strong sense, as s →
0, because one-parameter unitary groups generated by self-adjoint operators are
strongly continuous. There are various ways to solve the exercise. For example
we can prove σ(X) = [a, b]. This is impossible if P as above exists, because by
Theorem11.45 there should be a unitary operator S mapping X and P to the opera-
tors on L2(R, dx) of axiom A5 (passing from R3 to R1 in the obvious way). Another
possibility is to split L2([a, b], dx) in a Hilbert sum of closed, X- and P-invariant
spaces, on each of which there is the aforementioned unitary operator S. In either
case we can prove σ(X) = σ(SX S−1) = R ̸= [a, b].

Chapter 12
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
Mathematical sciences, in particular, display order, symmetry
and clear limits: and these are the uppermost instances of
beauty.
Aristotle
This chapter continues in the description of the mathematical structure of Quantum
Mechanics, by introducing fundamental notions and tools of great relevance.
Section one is devoted to deﬁning and characterising quantum symmetries. We
will present examples, discuss what happens in presence of superselection rules,
and deﬁne Kadison symmetries and Wigner symmetries. We shall then prove the
theorems of Wigner and Kadison, which show that the two notions of symmetry
actually coincide, and manifest themselves via unitary or anti-unitary operators.
In section two we will address the problem of representing symmetry groups, by
introducing projective representations, projective unitary representations and cen-
tral U(1)-extensions of a (symmetry) group. A part of the section will be in particular
dedicated to topological groups and the study of strongly continuous projective uni-
tary representations. We will examine the special case of the Abelian group R, that
has important applications in QM. Next, after recalling the basics on Lie groups and
Lie algebras, we will discuss key results due to Bargmann, Gårding and Nelson (and
a few generalisations thereof) about projective unitary and unitary representations of
Lie groups. We will consider the Peter–Weyl theorem on strongly continuous uni-
tary representations of compact Lie groups (or better, compact Hausdorff topological
groups).
Section three will present and discuss several physically important examples. As
an instance of primary importance in physics, we will study unitary representations
of the symmetry group SO(3) in relationship to the spin. Eventually we will apply
the machinery to the Galilean group, and prove Bargmann’s superselection rule of
the mass.

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
12.1
Deﬁnition and Characterisation of Quantum
Symmetries
A truly crucial notion in QM, also in view of the subsequent developments in Quan-
tum Field Theories, is that of symmetry of a quantum system. There are two ideas
of symmetry in quantum physics: one is dynamic and concerns conserved quantities
under temporal evolution, while the other, more elementary, one does not involve
temporal evolution. In this ﬁrst section we will deal with the second kind only, and
tackle the dynamic type in the next chapter.
Consider a physical system S described on the Hilbert space HS (not necessarily
separable in this context), and denote by S(HS) the space of states and by Sp(HS) the
space of pure states. When we act by a transformation g on S we alter its quantum
state. To the physical transformation g there corresponds a map γg : S(HS) →
S(HS) of states, or γg : Sp(HS) →Sp(HS) if we restrict to pure states. The
relationship between g and γg is not relevant at present, and we will take it for
granted; at any rate, it will depend upon the description of S. We shall call γg a
symmetry of the system if it obeys certain conditions. Abusing the terminology we
will often say g is a symmetry of S. Two are the requisites for γg to be a symmetry:
Sym1. γg must be bijective,
Sym2. γg should preserve some mathematical structure of S(HS) or Sp(HS). For
the moment we will not specify which structure exactly, although this will have a
precise physical interpretation.
In physics, requisite Sym1 can actually be forced upon the transformation g acting
on the system, and corresponds to asking that g be reversible, in other words (i) there
must exist an inverse transformation g−1, associated to γ −1
g
: S(HS) →S(HS), that
takes back to the original state, and (ii) any quantum state should be reachable via
γg, by choosing the initial state suitably.
The differences between the several symmetry notions known depend on the
interpretation of condition Sym2, i.e. on the γg-invariant structure. There are at
least two possible choices. The simplest structure that the map can preserve is the
convexity of the space of states, physically corresponding to the fact that a state arises
from mixing states with certain statistical weights. Symmetry operations modify the
constituent states, but do not change the weights. Quantum symmetries of this sort
were studied by Kadison [Kad51], and are nowadays called “Kadison symmetries”.
Another type, due to Wigner [Wig59], refers to functions on Sp(HS). For these one
requires that the metric structure of the projective space of rays be preserved. We
will call them “Wigner symmetries”. In the language of physics Wigner symmetries
modify pure states but do not change the transition probabilities of pure pairs.
As we shall see later, the symmetries of Kadison and Wigner have a dual action
on the observables of the theory. In this sense, symmetries can be viewed as bijec-
tive transformations of the observables of the theory (preserving some algebraic
structures) instead of states. This approach can be adopted right from the start, in
particular by deﬁning symmetries as automorphisms of the lattice of the elemen-
tary propositions of a quantum system. A more elaborated version of this idea of

12.1 Deﬁnition and Characterisation of Quantum Symmetries
667
quantum symmetry, introduced by Segal, enlarges the lattice to a Jordan algebra of
observables (see Sect.11.3.3) and deﬁnes symmetries as its automorphisms.
In the sequel we will mainly study the ﬁrst two types of symmetries deﬁned
as transformations of states. We will prove that mathematically they reduce to the
same concept, and that they are described by unitary or anti-unitary operators (hence
Wigner symmetries may be extended to Kadison symmetries deﬁned on the entire
space of states). The characterisation in terms of (anti-)unitary operators is hugely
important in physics, and is formulated in two results known as Kadison’s theorem
and Wigner’s theorem. The latter is much more renowned in the physical community,
despite the former is equally important. Some results on symmetries as transforma-
tions of observables, and Segal’s symmetries in particular, appear in Sect.12.1.7;
there we shall state a theorem establishing a bijection between Segal symmetries and
Kadison (or Wigner) symmetries, at least in absence of superselection rules. In that
section we shall also prove that Kadison symmetries are in one-to-one correspon-
dence with automorphisms of the lattice of elementary propositions (provided the
Hilbert space is separable and has dimension ̸= 2).
Remark 12.1 In quantum theory there is another physically relevant notion of trans-
formation, similar to – and sometimes confused with – a symmetry acting on observ-
ables. We are referring to gauge transformations (rather regrettably, also known as
gauge symmetries). A gauge symmetry is a unitary transformation of the Hilbert
space of the theory which leaves invariant every (typically unbounded) self-adjoint
operator representing an observable. This is equivalent to saying that it ﬁxes every
element of the von Neumann algebra of observables (in agreement with Deﬁnition
11.23, Exercise 11.3 and Remark 11.24). This is very different from a symmetry:
there is always at least one observable that is changed by any non-trivial symmetry,
whereas no observable is changed under gauge symmetries.
■
12.1.1
Examples
Before going into mathematical subtleties, let us describe a few examples of physical
operations that are (both Wigner and Kadison) symmetries for quantum systems.
Suppose we take an isolated physical system S in a certain inertial frame system
I . Transformations known to generate symmetries of S are the rigid translations of S
along a given vector, or the rotations about a ﬁxed real axis. Any continuous isometry
of the rest space of inertial frames produces a quantum symmetry. Another instance
is the transformation of inertial frame system (in relativistic theories as well): the
isolated system S in the inertial frame I is transformed so that the ﬁnal system
appears, in a different inertial system I ′ ̸= I , as it appeared at the beginning in I .
A third transformation giving symmetries, for isolated systems in inertial frames, is
time translation (not to be confused with time evolution), which we will see later.
All these transformations are active, meaning that they change the system S, or
better, its quantum state.

668

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
It must be crystal clear that the transformations we are talking about do not occur
because the system’s state evolves in time: they are idealised transformations, pure
mathematical notions. Some of them, by the way, could never occur in reality in a
system that evolves under its own dynamics, and others could hardly exist. A classical
example is the inversion of parity. This physical transformation, loosely speaking,
substitutes a system S with its mirror image. Sometimes the only way to invert the
parity, ideally, is to destroy the system and rebuild its symmetric image from scratch.
And sometimes even this abstract operation is physically hollow, owing to the very
nature of physical laws. Particles that interact under the weak force, surprisingly,
constitute systems whose states do not admit parity transformation as a symmetry,
in a rather radical sense: the space of states has no transformation γ representing the
ideal physical transformation of parity inversion. This simply means that the alleged
symmetry is not a true symmetry of the system.
Another type of transformation that shares some features with parity inversion,
and that is at times associated to symmetries, is time reversal. The examples seen so
far have to do with spacetime isometries. Albeit active on states, they are related to
passive transformations of frame systems (or just of coordinates) by means of passive
isometries of spacetime. In this case one expects (not always true, as we saw) active
transformations on states to be symmetries, precisely because the various frames or
coordinate systems – relative to passive (Galilean or Poincaré) transformations used
to describe reality, at least macroscopically – are equivalent. In other words: if we
act on the physical system S by an active transformation, we can always revoke the
outcome by changing frame system (or just coordinates), knowing the new framing
is physically equivalent to the original one.
In contrast to all this, there exist transformations related to symmetries which
are neither associated to spacetime isometries, nor reversed by changing frame. A
standard example is charge conjugation, which ﬂips the sign of all charges (of the type
considered) present in S, and thus changes the superselection sector of the charge.
There exist even more abstract transformations relative to internal symmetries and
gauge symmetries, on which we will not spend any time.
In conclusion we wish to underline an important physical fact. The lesson that
weak interactions teach us is this: deciding whether a transformation acting ideally
on a system is indeed a quantum symmetry, is ultimately to be established – after
Sym2 has been speciﬁed – experimentally.
After the theorems of Kadison and Wigner we will describe symmetries in terms
of (anti-)unitary operators, for the case in which the physical transformations form
an abstract, topological or Lie group [War75, NaSt82].
In the next chapter we shall treat dynamical symmetries, which emerge when one
deﬁnes the time evolution of the quantum state of a system S. In that context we will
recover the tight link between dynamical symmetries and associated conservation
laws. It is well known, in the classical setup, that this relationship is encoded into
the various formulations of the celebrated Noether’s theorem.

12.1.2
Symmetries in Presence of Abelian Superselection
Rules
As was observed already in Chap.7, if M is a closed subspace in the Hilbert space H
we can identify S(M) (or Sp(M)) with a subset of S(H) (resp. Sp(H)) in a natural
manner, i.e. by viewing S(M) (Sp(M)) as the collection of states ρ ∈S(H) (Sp(H))
such that Ran(ρ) ⊂M. This is the same as extending each ρ ∈S(M) to an operator
on H by declaring it equals zero on M⊥. In the remaining part of the chapter we will
implicitly make this identiﬁcation, which is useful in the next situation.
In certain circumstances the possible state of a physical system is not an element
in S(HS) (Sp(HS) if pure), because certain convex combinations are forbidden. This
is the case when we have superselection rules (see Sects.7.7.1, 7.7.2 and 11.2.1).
Without repeating everything, let us only recall that in presence of superselection
rulesHS splitsintoaHilbertsumofclosed,pairwiseorthogonal,non-trivialsubspaces
called coherent sectors:
HS =

k∈K
HSk .
Remark 12.2 Toguaranteethemaximumgeneralitywedonotassume,unlessexplic-
itly stated, that the spaces HS and HSk are separable nor that K is countable, even
though in concrete physical cases these are physical requirements.
■
Then we can deﬁne the spaces of states S(HSk) and pure states Sp(HSk) of each
sector. Note S(HSk) ∩S(HSj) = ∅and Sp(HSk) ∩Sp(HSj) = ∅if k ̸= j.
Concerning physically-admissible pure states for the superselection rule, these will
be precisely the constituents of the disjoint union

k∈K
Sp(HSk) .
Admissible mixtures by the superselection rule for the system S on H, instead, will
be all possible convex combinations (also inﬁnite, in the strong operator topology)
in

k∈K
S(HSk) .
The previous is equivalent to imposing that admissible states are the ρ in S(HS) (or
Sp(HS)) under which every HSk is invariant, namely Pkρ = ρPk for every k ∈K
where Pk is the orthogonal projector onto HSk (see Sect.7.7.1).
Itisworthnotingthatthispictureisnotthemostgeneralpossible,becausedifferent
elements ρ, ρ′ ∈S(HSk) can be physically indistinguishable if a gauge group is
present, as discussed in Sect.11.2.1. When the gauge group is trivial, one speaks of
Abelian superselection rules, the only type we shall consider henceforth. We will
come back on this issue at the end of Sect.12.1.4.

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
In case of Abelian superselection rules the symmetries must respect the coherent
decomposition of H, and one allows symmetries that jump sector, i.e. functions
γkk′ : S(HSk) →S(HSk′), k, k′ ∈K, possibly with k′ ̸= k. Every mapping γkk′ :
S(HSk) →S(HSk′) must be invertible and satisfy Wigner’s or Kadison’s invariance.
12.1.3
Kadison Symmetries
Consider a quantum system S described on the Hilbert space HS, with space of states
S(HS). There is a (physically weak) demand to have a symmetry that refers to the
mixing procedure of quantum states. An operation on S deﬁnes a symmetry if the
mixing procedure is invariant under it, or more precisely:
if a state is obtainable as mixture of certain states with given statistical weights,
then by transforming the system under an operation that generates a symmetry, the
same state must be obtainable as mixture of the transformed constituent states with
the same statistical weights.
Putequivalently,abijectionγ : S(HS) →S(HS)isasymmetrywhenitpreserves

Henceforth J will be ﬁnite. It is obvious that we may take J made of two points,
without loss of generality. Now we can present the formal deﬁnition in the general
case, when coherent superselection sectors are present.
Deﬁnition 12.3 (Kadison symmetry). Consider a quantum physical system S
described on the Hilbert space HS = ⊕k∈KHSk split in coherent sectors due to
Abelian superselection rules.
A symmetry of S according to Kadison from sector HSk to sector HSk′, k, k′ ∈K,
is a map γ : S(HSk) →S(HSk′) such that:
(a) γ is bijective;
(b) γ preserves the convex structures of S(HSk) and S(HSk′). Equivalently:
γ (p1ρ1 + p2ρ2) = p1γ (ρ1) + p2γ (ρ2) for ρ1, ρ2 ∈S(HSk) , p1 + p2 = 1, p1, p2 ∈[0, 1] .
(12.1)
If the Hilbert space H does not have coherent sectors, every bijection γ : S(H) →
S(H) preserving convexity is called a Kadison automorphism on H.
A symmetry according to Deﬁnition 12.3 is induced by an operator U : HSk →HSk′
that is either unitary or anti-unitary (Deﬁnition 5.39):
γ (U)(ρ) := UρU −1 ,
ρ ∈S(HSk).
(12.2)
To prove this we need an elementary lemma.

12.1 Deﬁnition and Characterisation of Quantum Symmetries
671
Lemma 12.4 Let U : H →H′ be an anti-unitary operator from H to H′, and N ⊂H
a Hilbert basis. Then U = VC, where V : H →H′ is unitary and C : H →H is
the natural conjugation (Deﬁnition 5.41) associated to N:
Cψ :=

z∈N
(z|ψ)z .
Proof Deﬁne V ψ := 
z∈N(z|ψ)Uz. The proof is immediate, because an anti-
unitary operator is anti-isometric and continuous and by elementary properties of
bases. Note that {Uz}z∈N is basis of H′.
⊓⊔
Proposition 12.5 Let U : HSk →HSk′ be unitary (isometric and onto), or anti-
unitary, where HSk and HSk′ are coherent sectors of the Hilbert space HS associated
to the quantum system S with space of states S(H). Then γ (U) : S(HSk) →B(H)
as deﬁned in (12.2) is a symmetry HSk →HSk′ according to Kadison.
Proof Property (12.1) is trivial under either assumption on U (not so, though, if we
allowed complex coefﬁcients pi). Let us prove γ (U)(ρ) ∈S(HSk′) for ρ ∈S(HSk).
Begin by assuming U unitary. If ρ is of trace class on HS so must be UρU −1 as
well, since trace-class operators form an ideal in B(HS) by Theorem 4.34(b) if we
view UρU −1 as composite in B(HS). For this it sufﬁces to think of ρ in S(HS)
as vanishing on the complement to HSk, and ρ(HSk) ⊂HSk, then extend U and
U −1 trivially on the orthogonal to HSk and HSk′ respectively, hence viewing them
as in B(HS). If ρ ≥0 then (ψ|UρU −1ψ) = (U ∗ψ|ρU ∗ψ) ≥0, so γ (U)(ρ) ≥0.
Using the basis formed by merging a basis on HSk and a basis on (HSk)⊥we obtain
tr

γ (U)(ρ)
	
= tr

UρU −1	
= tr(U −1Uρ) = tr(ρ) = 1. In the last passage we
used U −1U↾HSk= I↾HSk in computing the trace, and that ρ = 0 on (HSk)⊥. Therefore
γ (U)(ρ) ∈S(HSk′) for ρ ∈S(HSk). Now assume U anti-unitary. Decompose U as
in Lemma 12.4: U = VC with respect to some basis N ⊂HS, speciﬁed later. We
claim UρU −1 is positive, of trace class and with trace one. As V is unitary (in which
case the claim holds by what we have just seen) and UρU −1 = V (CρC−1)V −1, it is
enough to prove the claim for U = C. Choose N to be made of eigenvectors ψ for
ρ (Theorem 4.20 ensures its existence). Hence
ρφ =

ψ∈N
pψ(ψ|φ)ψ ,
φ ∈H. Now recall C is continuous and antilinear, CC = I, ( f |g) = (C f |Cg) by
deﬁnition of conjugation, every eigenvector pψ of ρ is real (positive), and Cψ = ψ.
Consequently
CρC−1φ =

ψ∈N
pψ(ψ|Cφ)Cψ =

ψ∈N
pψ(CCψ|Cφ)Cψ =


ψ∈N
pψ(Cψ|φ)Cψ =

ψ∈N
pψ(ψ|Cφ)ψ = ρφ .

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
We proved CρC−1 = ρ, so CρC−1 is of trace class, positive and has trace 1 for
ρ ∈S(HSk).
⊓⊔
Example 12.6 If the superselection rule regards the electrical charge of a system,
there will be (inﬁnitely many, in general) sectors Hq, one for each value q of the
charge. Charge conjugation can be constructed as a collection of symmetries of type
γ (Uq), where Uq : Hq →H−q for any q.
■
12.1.4
Wigner Symmetries
Now let us pass to quantum symmetries according to Wigner. Consider the usual
quantum system S, described on the Hilbert space HS and with space of states S(HS).
We focus on pure states Sp(HS) (the rays of HS). Let us restrict to transformations
δ : Sp(HS) →Sp(HS) .
From the experimental viewpoint we can control the transition probability
|(ψ|ψ′)|2 = tr(ρρ′)
of two pure states ρ = ψ(ψ| ), ρ′ = ψ′(ψ′| ). Wigner’s condition for a bijection
δ : Sp(HS) →Sp(HS) to be a symmetry is that it preserves transition probabilities:
if two pure states have a certain transition probability, when transforming the system
by a physical operation that determines a symmetry the transformed states must
maintain the same transition probability.
The next deﬁnition takes into account coherent sectors.
Deﬁnition 12.7 (Wigner symmetry). Consider a quantum system S described on
the Hilbert space HS with space of states S(HS). Assume HS splits coherently as
HS = ⊕k∈KHSk due to Abelian superselection rules.
A symmetry of S according to Wigner from HSk to HSk′, k, k′ ∈K, is a mapping
δ : Sp(HSk) →Sp(HSk′) with the following properties:
(a) δ is bijective;
(b) δ preserves transition probabilities:
tr (ρ1ρ2) = tr (δ(ρ1)δ(ρ2)) ,
ρ1, ρ2 ∈Sp(HSk) .
(12.3)
If H has no coherent sectors every bijection δ : Sp(H) →Sp(H) that preserves
transition probabilities is a Wigner automorphism on H.
An example according to Deﬁnition 11.25 is, as with Kadison symmetries, the sym-
metry induced by the (anti-)unitary operator U : HSk →HSk′ (Deﬁnition 5.32),
where:
δ(U)(ρ) := UρU −1 ,
ρ ∈Sp(HSk).
(12.4)

12.1 Deﬁnition and Characterisation of Quantum Symmetries
673
In contrast to Kadison’s symmetries, here the proof is really straightforward.
Remarks 12.8 (1) Since pure states have the form ψ(ψ| ), ||ψ|| = 1, the action of
δ(U) on pure states can be described, equivalently though sloppily, by saying δ(U)
sends the pure state ψ to the pure state Uψ. This is the way in which QM books
often describe symmetries induced by (anti-)unitary operators.
(2) Every Kadison symmetry transforms pure states to pure states, so it deﬁnes a
bijective map on the space of pure states. However, we do not know a priori that this
will deﬁne a Wigner symmetry, because it is far from evident that it will preserve
transition probabilities. On the other hand, a Wigner symmetry does not extend
naturally from pure to mixed states. Therefore it is not obvious that the two notions
coincide. Yet every unitary or anti-unitary operator determines at the same time a
Wigner symmetry and a Kadison symmetry by means of ρ →UρU −1.
■
To ﬁnish, here is a general notion of Wigner symmetry.
Deﬁnition 12.9 (General Wigner symmetry). Suppose the Hilbert space HS of sys-
tem S decomposes in coherent sectors due to Abelian superselection rules, so that
admissible pure states are the elements of
Sp(HS)adm :=

k∈K
Sp(HSk) .
A symmetry according to Wigner (no mention of sectors) is a bijective map δ from
Sp(HS)adm to itself that preserves transition probabilities.
We can recover the above deﬁnition using Wigner symmetries between pairs of
sectors, as follows.
Proposition 12.10 Let δ be a Wigner symmetry of S, and suppose the Hilbert space
HS of S splits coherently in such a way that admissible pure states are only those in:
Sp(HS)adm =


where || ||1 is the canonical norm of trace-class operators. Then the sets Sp(HSk) are
theconnectedcomponentsofSp(HS)adm (Exercise12.6).Themapδ : Sp(HS)adm →
Sp(HS)adm is a surjective isometry for d as follows from Proposition 12.41 (the latter
is independent of the present result). In particular δ is a homeomorphism. As such,
it preserves maximal connected subsets, and so it must split as a sum of isometric
bijections between distinct sectors, i.e. Wigner symmetries between distinct sectors.
⊓⊔
Before we examine the mathematical structure of symmetries we wish to put
the spotlight one more time on the remaining physical limitation of the picture
we are drawing. As already stressed in Sect.7.7.2 (especially the comment below
Proposition 7.86 and Remark 7.89(2)) and Sect.11.2.1, distinct density matrices
ρ ̸= ρ′ ∈S(HSk) represent different physical situations only when observables
separate states. This is equivalent to the demand that the von Neumann algebra
of observables pertinent to the sector HSk is the whole B(HSk) (see Proposition
11.18), and this is the case when Abelian superselection rules occur, the only type
we have so far considered. But this is not true in the general situation, in which
the commutant R′
S of the algebra of observables is larger than the centre RS ∩R′
S:
think of quarks and other hadrons for instance. When observables do not separate
trace-class operators of trace one, the physical meaning of the facts we are about
to prove becomes dubious (although the statements are valid), because the require-
ments Sym1 and Sym2, which we have assumed deﬁne symmetries, are no longer
physically justiﬁed when interpreted in terms of density matrices. For instance there
is no need for a symmetry to be bijective as a map S(HSk) →S(HSk′), since
copies of distinct operators ρ, ρ′ ∈S(HSk) can still represent exactly the same
measure on LRSk(HSk) and such measures are better suited to retain, without redun-
dancies, the experimental information of a physical state. To encompass the most
general situation of non-Abelian superselection rules, the deﬁnition of symmetry
should be reformulated by relying upon axioms A1 (measure-theory version) and
A2 (measure-theory version) regarding states and observables and by adopting the
description Ss1 (measure-theory formulation) and Ss2 (measure-theory formula-
tion) of superselection rules. A very small step towards this more general description
will appear in Sect.12.1.7. Alternatively, if we stick to the description of states in
terms of operators in S(HSk), symmetries should be deﬁned as maps between spaces
S(HSk) that are bijective up to transformations of the gauge group of the theory (see
Sect.11.2.3). Then requisite Sym2 should also be relaxed accordingly.
12.1.5
The Theorems of Wigner and Kadison
We begin by Wigner’s theorem. Using that, we will prove Kadison’s result along the
lines of [Sim76]. The proof of Wigner’s theorem is quite direct. Although there are
more elegant, but indirect arguments, our approach has the advantage of showing
explicitly how to manufacture U with a basis. Let us remark, in passing, that several

675
authors (including Emch, Piron, Bargmann and Varadarajan) proved that a slightly
modiﬁed version of Wigner’s theorem holds within QM formulations based on real
and quaternionic Hilbert spaces.
Theorem 12.11 (Wigner). Consider a quantum system S described on the (not nec-
essarily separable) complex Hilbert space HS. Suppose HS coherently splits1 as
HS = ⊕k∈KHSk and dim HSk > 1 for every k ∈K. Assume
δ : Sp(HSk) →Sp(HSk′)
is a symmetry of S according to Wigner from HSk to HSk′, k, k′ ∈K. Then
(a) there exists an operator U : HSk →HSk′, unitary or anti-unitary depending on
δ, such that:
δ(ρ) = UρU −1 for any pure state ρ ∈Sp(HSk);
(12.5)
(b) U is determined up to a phase factor, i.e., U1 satisﬁes (12.5) (replacing U) if and
only if U1 = χU for some χ ∈C, |χ| = 1.
In case dim HSk = 1(= dim HSk′) for some k, (a) is still valid with the difference
that δ (which is unique) can be represented by a unitary or an anti-unitary operator
indifferently.
Proof (a) Let us build an operator U representing δ. Take a Hilbert basis {ψn}n∈N
in HSk where N is any ﬁnite or inﬁnite set of indices, with ψn ̸= ψm when n ̸=
m, and the space is not necessarily separable but has dimension ≥2. To each ψn
associate the pure state ρψn := ψn(ψn| ). Let δ act on these states, obtaining pure
states δ(ρψn) = ψ′
n(ψ′
n| ) ∈Sp(HSk′), where the unit vectors ψ′
n ∈HSk′ are
determined up to a phase factor. Fix once and for all this phase, arbitrarily. Note
{ψ′
n}n∈N is a Hilbert basis of HSk′: the vectors are in fact orthonormal, because
|(ψ′
n|ψ′
m)|2 = tr(δ(ρn)δ(ρm)) = tr(ρψnρψm) = |(ψn|ψm)|2 = δnm. We claim that
ψ′ ⊥ψ′
n ⇒ψ′ = 0. Let ψ′ ⊥ψ′
n for every n ∈N. If ψ′ ̸= 0, without loss of
generality we assume ||ψ′|| = 1 and deﬁne ρ′ := ψ′(ψ′| ) ∈Sp(HSk′). Since δ is
onto, then ρ′ = δ(ρ) with ρ = ψ(ψ| ) for some ψ ∈HSk, ||ψ|| = 1. Therefore:
|(ψ′|ψ′
n)|2 = tr(δ(ρ)δ(ρψn)) = tr(ρρψn) = |(ψ|ψn)|2 = 0
and then ψ = 0, for {ψn}n∈N is a basis. But this is impossible as ||ψ|| = 1. Conse-
quently ψ′ = 0, and {ψ′
n}n∈N is a basis.
Using the bases {ψn}n∈N and {ψ′
n}n∈N we will deﬁne the operator U in stages.
Select a preferred index o ∈N and deﬁne unit vectors
Ψk := 2−1/2 (ψo + ψk) ,
k ∈N \ {o}
and corresponding pure states: (Ψk| ) Ψk, k ∈N \ {o}. The transformed state
δ(Ψk(Ψk| )) = Ψ ′
k(Ψ ′
k| ) satisﬁes, in particular:
1If K = {1} one should replace HSk, HSk′ by H in the statement.

with |χ′

k can be chosen as we want.
The χk carry the information of δ, and we shall employ them soon.
Let us deﬁne the action of a map U (for the moment not necessarily linear or
antilinear) on all vectors ψn and on (ψo + ψk)/
√
2 by declaring:
U(ψo) := ψ′
o ,
U(ψk) := χkψ′
k ,
U(2−1/2(ψ0 + ψk)) := 2−1/2(ψ′
o + χkψ′
k) ,
(12.6)
k ∈N \ {o}. With this we are sure that if φ is one of the above arguments of U and
ρφ its pure state, then δ(ρφ) is associated to ρUφ as requested by the thesis.
Now we extend U to any normalised vector ψ = 
n∈N anψn ∈HSk in a way
that U continues to represent δ. Assume ||ψ|| = 1 and let ψ′ ∈HSk′ with ||ψ′|| = 1
be such that ψ′(ψ′| ) = δ(ρψ). Then
ψ′ =

n∈N
a′
nψ′
n .
(12.7)
The coefﬁcients a′
k are given, up to a global phase factor, by the coefﬁcients an and
by δ. With our assumptions on δ we have
|(ψ′|ψ′
n)|2 = tr(δ(ρψ)δ(ρψn)) = tr(ρψρψn) = |(ψ|ψn)|2 .
In other words, |a′
n| = |an|. Using this, together with the ﬁrst two of (12.6), identity
(12.7) can be rephrased as
ψ′ = χ
⎛
⎝aoU(ψo) +

n∈N\{o}
χ−1

nU(ψn)

⎠,
where χ, |χ| = 1, is arbitrary. Now deﬁne
U(ψ) := aoU(ψo) +

n∈N\{o}
χ−1
n a′
nU(ψn) .
(12.8)
This ensures, by construction, ρU(ψ) = δ(ρψ), and one veriﬁes that the deﬁnition
extends (12.6). However, U(ψ) is not yet ﬁxed, because we still do not know the
coefﬁcients a′
n in terms of the components an of ψ. Let us ﬁnd this relation. By
construction of U and under the hypotheses on δ, |(Ψk|ψ)| = |(U(Ψk)|U(ψ))|. By
(12.8) this means

12.1 Deﬁnition and Characterisation of Quantum Symmetries

|ao + ak|2 = |ao + χ−1
k a′
k|2 .
Since |ak| = |a′
k|, the latter implies
Re(aoak) = Re(aoχ−1
k a′
k) .
If we assume ao ∈R \ {0}, recalling that |ak| = |a′
k|, the previous equations occur
only in one of these cases
a′
k = χkak
or a′
k = χkak ,
where we henceforth assume χo := 1 according to the ﬁrst identity in (12.6), Hence,
for any ψ = 
n anψn with ao ∈R \ {0} we have
U(ψ) =

n∈Aψ
anχnψ′
n +

n∈Bψ
anχnψ′
n .
For the given ψ we can always choose one of Aψ, Bψ empty.2 Suppose the contrary.
The components of ψ′ satisfy a′
p = χpap and a′
q = χqaq, for some pair p ̸= q,
where Imap, Imaq ̸= 0. If φ = 2−1/2(ψp + ψq), then by construction:
|(φ′|ψ′)|2 = |(φ|ψ)|2 ,
where φ′ := U(φ) = 2−1/2(χpψ′
p + χqψ′
q). The displayed equation reads
ap + aq
2 =
ap + aq
2 ,
i.e.
Re(apaq) = Re(apaq).
This would imply Imaq = −Imaq, an absurd.
In summary, if ψ = 
n anψn ∈HSk, ||ψ|| = 1 and ao ∈R \ {0}, there are two
possible deﬁnitions for Uψ:
Uψ =

n∈N
anχnψ′
n
or Uψ =

n∈N
anχnψ′
n .
(12.9)
With both choices we are sure that Uψ represents δ(ρψ) when ||ψ|| = 1 and ao ∈
R \ {0}. We claim the choice of one deﬁnition does not depend on ψ. Consider a
generic unit vector ψ = 
n anψn ∈HSk and ao ∈R \ {0}. Deﬁne ψ(nc) associated
to c ∈C, Imc ̸= 0, for every n = 1, 2, . . .:
2There is a certain ambiguity in deﬁning Aψ and Bψ, because the subscripts n of the possible real
coefﬁcients an can be chosen either in An or in Bn indifferently.

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
ψ(nc) :=
1

1 + |c|2 (ψo + cψn) .
Since |(ψ|ψ(nc))| = |(Uψ|Uψ(nc))| has to hold, necessarily ψ(nc) and ψ are of the
same type with respect to the option of (12.9). Therefore all ψ = 
n anψn ∈HSk,
||ψ|| = 1, and ao ∈R \ {0} are of the same type.
We can ﬁnally pass to the whole Hilbert space, dropping the requirement ||ψ|| = 1
and deﬁne the operators U : HSk →HSk′ by:
U : ψ =

n∈N
anψn →

n∈N
anχnψ′
n
in the linear case,
U : ψ =

n∈N
anψn →

n∈N
anχnψ′
n
in the antilinear case.
By construction, since both {ψn}n∈N and {χnψ′
n}n∈N are Hilbert bases, the former
are isometric and onto (unitary), the latter anti-isometric and onto (anti-unitary).
Moreover, restricting to unit vectors ψ = 
n anψn with a0 ∈R \ {0}, we have
ρUψ = δ(ρψ)
(12.10)
in either case, as required. There remains to prove that (12.10) holds for pure states
associated to ψ = 
n∈N anψn with ao /∈R \ {0}. First observe that only the case
ao = 0 has to be investigated, since ao /∈R can be reduced to ao ∈R \ {0} by
multiplying ψ by a phase χ, because this change does not affect ρψ and ρUψ. The
remaining case ao = 0 can be treated with a continuity argument. From Proposition
12.41 (whose proof is independent from the present result), if ρψ, ρψ′ ∈Sp(H) then
||ρψ −ρψ′||1 = 2

1 −|(ψ|ψ′)|2 .
It is therefore obvious that both maps δ : Sp(HSk) ∋ρψ →δ(ρψ) ∈Sp(HSk′)
and u : Sp(HSk) ∋ρψ →ρUψ ∈Sp(HSk′), with U : HSk →HSk′ unitary or
anti-unitary from earlier, are continuous with respect to these distances because they
are isometric. A pure state in Sp(HSk) described by a unit vector with a0 = 0 is
a limit point of pure states described by unit vectors with ao ̸= 0, as is evident if
we look at the components. For these states δ(ρ) = u(ρ) as established in (12.10),
hence continuity implies that this identity holds also for pure states associated to unit
vectors with ao = 0: (12.10) is valid everywhere on Sp(HSk).
Let us ﬁnally prove that the unitary and anti-unitary character of U is decided by
δ. The above construction of U is affected by a choice of phases at several places.
On the contrary, the next argument is independent from the construction. Here only
the requirement dim(HSk) > 1 is crucial. Suppose that there exist U unitary and V
anti-unitary such that both implement the same δ. As a consequence, if ρψ = ψ(ψ|·)
for ||ψ|| = 1, we immediately have UρψU −1 = δ(ρψ) = VρψV −1. Deﬁning the

12.1 Deﬁnition and Characterisation of Quantum Symmetries
679
anti-unitary operator C := V −1U we therefore have Cρψ = ρψC for every unit
vector ψ. Hence Cψ = λψψ for some λψ ∈U(1) (this restriction arises from
C2ψ = |λψ|2ψ where C2 is unitary so that |λψ|2 ∈U(1), i.e. |λψ| = 1). If φ is
another unit vector normal to ψ, which exists for dim(H) > 1, then
λφφ + λψψ = Cφ + Cψ = C(φ + ψ) = λ2−1/2(φ+ψ)(φ + ψ)
and so
(λφ −λ2−1/2(φ+ψ))φ = −(λφ −λ2−1/2(φ+ψ))ψ .
Since φ and ψ are linearly independent, the identity found implies
λφ = λψ = λ2−1/2(φ+ψ) .
Repeating the argument for each pair of vectors of a Hilbert basis B := {ψn}n∈N
(recall that dim(HSk) > 1), we get Cψn = λBψn for every n ∈N and some common
λB ∈U(1). As a consequence, for every vector ψ = 
n∈N anψn ∈HSk,
Cψ = λB

n∈N
anψn .
(12.11)
Next, consider another basis B1 := {φn := eiβnψn}n∈N, where the constants βn ∈R
are ﬁxed arbitrarily, so that ψ = 
n∈N e−iβnanφn. The previous argument applied
to B1 yields, for some other constant λB1 ∈U(1),
Cψ = λB1

n∈N
e−iβnanφn = λB1

n∈N
aneiβnφn .
(12.12)
On the other hand, (12.11) and φn = eiβnψn furnish
Cψ = λB

n∈N
ane−iβnφn .
Comparing with (12.12) and using the fact that {φn}n∈N is a basis, we conclude that,
in particular, for a pair of indices n1 ̸= n2,
λBλ−1
B1 = e2iβn1 = e2iβn1 .
Since we are free to deﬁne B1 by ﬁxing βn1 ̸= βn2 + kπ (k ∈Z), the identity above
is impossible and therefore U and V cannot exist simultaneously.
(b) Let us prove that if U exists, it is unique up to a phase factor. Clearly if U
satisﬁes the thesis for δ, then U1 := χU will do the same for any χ ∈C, |χ| = 1.
We claim this is the only possibility. Suppose there is another U1 for δ. From the
proof of (a) U and U1 must be both unitary or both anti-unitary. If ρ = ψ(ψ| ) then,

680
12
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
setting L := U −1U1 we have Lψ(ψ|L−1φ) = ψ(ψ|φ) for any unit vectors ψ, φ.
Hence Lψ(Lψ|φ) = ψ(ψ|φ), as L is unitary. Since Lψ(Lψ| ) = ψ(ψ| ), Lψ
and ψ determine the same pure state, so Lψ = χψψ for every unit vector ψ ∈HSk
and for some unit number χψ ∈C. Choose ψ, ψ′ orthogonal (they exist because
dim HSk > 1). The linearity of L implies
χ2−1/2(ψ+ψ′)(ψ + ψ′) = L(ψ + ψ′) = Lψ + Lψ′ = χψψ + χψ′ψ′ .
Therefore
(χ2−1/2(ψ+ψ′) −χψ)ψ = (χψ′ −χ2−1/2(ψ+ψ′))ψ′ .
As ψ, ψ′ are linearly independent, we have (χ2−1/2(ψ+ψ′) −χψ) = 0 and (χψ′ −
χ2−1/2(ψ+ψ′)) = 0, so χψ = χψ′. Hence, decomposing L along a Hilbert basis, for
some unit χ ∈C we have
Lψ = χψ
for every ψ ∈HSk ,
and so either U1 = χU or U1 = χU according to the unitary or anti-unitary nature
of U and U1.
The last statement is obvious: if HSk and HSk′ have dimension 1, for every choice
of unit vectors ψ ∈HSk and ψ′ ∈HSk′, necessarily δ(ψ(ψ| )) = ψ′(ψ′| ), so both
U : aψ →aψ′ and U1 : aψ →aψ′ for every a ∈C implement δ.
⊓⊔
Remark 12.12 It is worth stressing that, in spite of the multiple descriptions of δ|HSk
in terms of unitary and anti-unitary operators if dim HSk = 1, the map δ|HSk is
uniquely ﬁxed, because HSk (and HSk′) contains only one equivalence class of unit
vectors.
■
Let us move on to Kadison’s theorem, which we will reduce to Wigner’s theorem
following an idea of Roberts and Roepstorff [RoRo69], see [Sim76]. We start by
proving the theorem in dimension two.
Proposition 12.13 Let H be a two-dimensional Hilbert space. If γ : S(H) →S(H)
is a Kadison automorphism, there exists U : H →H unitary, or anti-unitary, such
that:
γ (ρ) = UρU −1 ,
ρ ∈S(H).
Proof Let us characterise states and pure states on H by means of the Poincaré
sphere. A state ρ ∈S(H) is, in the present situation, a positive-deﬁnite Hermitian
matrix with unit trace. The real space of Hermitian matrices has a basis made by I
and the Pauli matrices:
σ1 =
 0 1
1 0

, σ2 =
 0 −i
i 0

, σ3 =
 1 0
0 −1

.
(12.13)
So for some a, bn ∈R

ρ = aI +

n=1
bnσn .
The condition tr(ρ) = 1 ﬁxes a = 1/2, since the σn are traceless. Positive def-
initeness, i.e. the demand the two eigenvalues of ρ are positive, is equivalent to

b1

3 ≤1/2, by direct computation. Overall, the elements ρ of S(H) are
in one-to-one correspondence to vectors n ∈R3, |n| ≤1:
ρ = 1
2 (I + n · σ) .
(12.14)
Having ρ pure, i.e. having a unique eigenvalue 1, is equivalent to |n| = 1, as a direct
check shows. Altogether S(H) is in one-to-one correspondence with the closed unit
ball B in R3 centred at the origin; the subset of pure states Sp(H) corresponds one-
to-one to the surface ∂B. We call B, viewed in this way, the Poincaré sphere. The
correspondence just deﬁned:
B ∋n →ρn ∈S(H)
is a true isomorphism: by (12.14), in fact,
ρpn+qm = pρn + qρm
for any n, m ∈B if p, q ≥0, p + q = 1 .
Hence the convex geometry of the spaces is preserved. An important property, for
later, is the formula
tr (ρmρn) = 1
2 (1 + m · n)
(12.15)
that descends directly from tr(σ j) = 0, tr(σiσ j) = 2δi j (easy to prove). Now we are
ready to characterise Kadison automorphisms. Assigning a Kadison automorphism
γ : S(H) →S(H) is patently the same as deﬁning a bijection γ ′ : B →B such
that
γ ′(pn + qm) = pγ ′(n) + qγ ′(m) for any n, m ∈B if p, q ≥0, p + q = 1 .
If the Kadison automorphism γ : S(H) →S(H) ﬁxes γ ′ : B →B, the map
Γ : R3 →R3:
Γ (0) := 0 ,
Γ (v) := |v|γ ′
 v
|v|

,
v ∈R3 \ {0}
extends γ ′, is linear and invertible. The proof is straightforward. Kadison auto-
morphisms, being isomorphisms, map extreme elements to extreme elements, so
Γ (n) = γ ′(n) = 1 if |n| = 1, and by linearity:

682
12
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
|Γ (v)| = |v| ,
v ∈R3 .
In conclusion the linear map Γ : R3 →R3 associated to the Kadison automor-
phism γ is an isometry of R3 with the origin as ﬁxed point, so Γ ∈O(3), the
three-dimensional orthogonal group. Conversely, Γ ∈O(3) implies γ ↾Sp(H) is an
automorphism according to Wigner. In fact if ρn and ρm are pure, their transition
probability equals tr (ρnρm), which we can express via (12.15). Since Γ is orthog-
onal:
tr (γ (ρn)γ (ρm)) = 1
2 (1 + Γ (n) · Γ (m)) = 1
2 (1 + n · m) = tr (ρnρm) .
Recalling γ ′ ↾∂B= Γ ↾∂B: ∂B →∂B is trivially a bijection (this is true for every
orthogonal matrix), then γ↾Sp(H): Sp(H) →Sp(H) is bijective, and hence a Wigner
automorphism. Wigner’s theorem implies the existence of a unitary or anti-unitary
operator U : H →H such that γ (ρ) = UρU −1 for any ρ ∈Sp(H). If ρ ∈S(H)
we can decompose it as convex combinations of two pure states associated to the
eigenvectors of ρ. If ρ1, ρ2 ∈Sp(H) are the states in question for some p ∈[0, 1],
then ρ = pρ1 + (1 −p)ρ2, and so
γ (ρ) = pγ (ρ1) + (1 −p)γ (ρ2) = pUρ1U −1 + (1 −p)Uρ2U −1
= U (pρ1 + (1 −p)ρ2) U −1 = UρU −1 .
Therefore the unitary (or anti-unitary) operator U satisﬁes the theorem’s claim.
⊓⊔
Let us state and prove Kadison’s theorem in general. (Kadison originally proved
the non-trivial statements (a) and (b)).
Theorem 12.14 (Kadison). Consider a quantum system S described on the (not
necessarily separable) complex Hilbert space HS. Suppose HS coherently splits3 as
HS = ⊕k∈KHSk and dim HSk > 1 for every k ∈K. Suppose the map
γ : S(HSk) →S(HSk′)
is a symmetry of S according to Kadison from HSk to HSk′, k, k′ ∈K. Then
(a) there exists an operator U : HSk →HSk′, unitary or anti-unitary depending on
γ , such that:
γ (ρ) = UρU −1 for every state ρ ∈S(HSk).
(12.16)
(b) U is determined up to phase, i.e. U1 satisﬁes (12.16) (replacing U) if and only if
U1 = χU with χ ∈C, |χ| = 1.
(c) The restriction of γ to pure states is a Wigner symmetry.
(d) Every Wigner symmetry δ : Sp(HSk) →Sp(HSk′) extends, uniquely, to a Kadi-
son symmetry γ (δ) : S(HSk) →S(HSk′).
3If K = {1} one should replace HSk, HSk′ by H in the statement.

12.1 Deﬁnition and Characterisation of Quantum Symmetries
683
In case dim HSk = 1(= dim HSk′) for some k, then (a), (c), (d) are still valid, with
the difference that γ (which is unique) can be represented indifferently by a unitary
or an anti-unitary operator.
Proof (b) and (c). Suppose U in (a) exists. Since γ is bijective and preserves con-
vexity, it preserves extreme and non-extreme sets, and maps pure states to pure states
and mixed ones to mixed ones. It is therefore clear that δ := γ ↾Sp(HSk) deﬁnes a
Wigner symmetry associated to the same U and thus the common character (unitary
or anti-unitary) of U and any other operator satisfying (12.16) is ﬁxed by δ. By the
same argument it is clear that U is determined up to a phase by δ, in view of Wigner’s
theorem. Part (d) will show that δ completely deﬁnes γ and so the character of U is
determined by γ , and U itself is determined up to a phase by γ .
(d) If δ is a Wigner symmetry, by Wigner’s theorem there is a unitary or anti-
unitary operator U such that δ(ρ) = UρU −1 for any pure state, which deﬁnes the
Kadison symmetry γ (δ)(ρ) = UρU −1 extending δ to the whole space of states.
Let us prove the uniqueness of γ (δ). If two Kadison symmetries γ, γ ′, associated to
U, U ′ (unitary or anti-unitary), coincide on Sp(HSk), then the Wigner symmetries
δ(U) = U · U −1, δ(U ′) = U ′ · U ′−1 are the same. By Wigner’s theorem U and U ′ are
both unitary or both anti-unitary, and U = χU ′ with |χ| = 1. Therefore
γ (ρ) = UρU −1 = χU ′ρU ′−1χ−1 = χχ−1U ′ρU ′−1 = U ′ρU ′−1 = γ ′(ρ)
for every ρ ∈S(HSk), so γ = γ ′.
Let us pass to (a) and divide the proof in steps. As already remarked γ maps
pure states to pure states and mixed ones to mixed ones, bijectively. We claim that if
M ⊂HSk is a two-dimensional subspace there is a two-dimensional space M′ ⊂HSk′
such that γ (S(M)) = S(M′). If ψ1, ψ2 are unit vectors forming a (non-orthogonal,
in general) basis of M, the generic element in S(M) is ρ = pψ1(ψ1| ) + qψ2(ψ2| ),
p + q = 1 and p, q ≥0. Hence:
γ (ρ) = pγ (ψ1(ψ1| )) + qγ (ψ2(ψ2| )) = pψ′
1(ψ′
1| ) + qψ′
2(ψ′
2| ) ,
where the unit vectors ψ′
1, ψ′
2 arise (up to phase) from the corresponding pure states
γ (ψ1(ψ1| )), γ (ψ1(ψ1| )). The latter must be distinct, otherwise the bijection γ −1 :
S(HSk′) →S(HSk), that preserves convexity, would map pure to mixed. So ψ′
1 and
ψ′
2, both unit, satisfy ψ′
1 ̸= aψ′
2 for any a ∈C, and hence are linearly independent.
The space M′ is then generated by ψ′
1, ψ′
2.
Now we need two lemmas.
Lemma 12.15 Under our assumptions on γ , there exists a Wigner symmetry δ :
Sp(HSk) →Sp(HSk′) such that γ (ρ) = δ(ρ) for every ρ ∈Sp(HSk).
Proof of Lemma 12.15. Since γ and γ −1 preserve extreme and non-extreme sets,
γ ↾Sp(HSk): Sp(HSk) →Sp(HSk′) is invertible, because the left and right inverse is
just γ −1↾Sp(HSk′): Sp(HSk′) →Sp(HSk). The proof ends once we show γ ↾Sp(HSk)
preserves transition probabilities. Given φ, ψ ∈HSk unit and distinct, let M be their

684
12
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
span and M′ ⊂HSk′ the two-dimensional space such that γ (S(M)) ⊂S(M′), as
above. Call U : M′ →M an arbitrary unitary operator. Deﬁne
γ ′(ρ) := Uγ (ρ)U −1 ,
ρ ∈S(M).
Immediately, γ ′ is a Kadison symmetry if we restrict to the 2-dimensional Hilbert
space H = M. As shown in Proposition 12.13, Kadison’s theorem holds and there is a
unitary, or anti-unitary, map V : M →M such that γ ′(ρ) = Uγ (ρ)U −1 = VρV −1.
Otherwise said:
γ (ρ) = UVρ(UV )−1 ,
ρ ∈S(M).
We stress that even though U and V depend on M and M′, their existence is enough to
conclude the proof. Consider any two linearly independent unit vectors ψ, φ ∈HSk,
deﬁne M as their span and M′ as the span of the associated ψ′, φ′ ∈HSk′, obtained
(up to phase) by applying γ as we said above. Using the result we have found,
tr (γ (ψ(ψ| ))γ (φ(φ| ))) = tr

UV ψ(ψ| )(UV )−1UV φ(φ| )(UV )−1	
=
= tr

UV ψ(ψ| )φ(φ| )(UV )−1	
= tr (ψ(ψ| )φ(φ| )) .
In other words γ ↾Sp(HSk) preserves transition probabilities between different pure
states. If instead ψ(ψ| ) = φ(φ| ), we have
tr (γ (ψ(ψ| ))γ (ψ(ψ| ))) = 1 = tr (ψ(ψ| )ψ(ψ| )) ,
trivially. So we have proved that γ ↾Sp(HSk) preserves transition probabilities, and
hence is a Wigner symmetry.
□
By the previous lemma, and invoking Wigner’s Theorem 12.11, there exists a
unitary, or anti-unitary, operator U : HSk →HSk′ such that
γ (ρ) = UρU −1 ,
ρ ∈Sp(HSk).
(12.17)
The proof now ends if we prove that the above identity holds also for ρ ∈S(HSk),
and not only for Sp(HSk). For that, note (12.17) is equivalent to:
U −1γ (ρ)U = ρ ,
ρ ∈Sp(HSk).
(12.18)
Therefore Γ := U −1γ (·)U : S(HSk) →S(HSk) is a Kadison symmetry (a Kadison
automorphism,actually)thatreducestotheidentityonpurestates.Kadison’stheorem
is eventually proved after we establish the following lemma.
Lemma 12.16 Let H ̸= {0} be a Hilbert space. If a Kadison automorphism Γ :
S(H) →S(H) restricts to the identity on pure states, it is the identity.
Proof of Lemma 12.16. Let ρ = N
k=0 pkψk(ψk| ) be a ﬁnite convex combination
of pure states. Then

Therefore the claim holds for every ρ ∈S(H) provided ﬁnite (convex) combinations
of pure states are dense in S(H) in some topology for which Γ is continuous. Let
us show this works if we take the topology of trace-class operators induced by the
norm ||T ||1 := tr(|T|) (see Chap.4).
If ρ ∈S(H) we can decompose the operator spectrally:
ρ =


where pk > 0, 
k∈N pk = 1. Convergence is understood in the strong topology, and
also in uniform topology (if pk ≥pk−1), as we know from Chap.4. Let us prove,
further, that we may approximate ρ by ﬁnite (convex) combinations of pure states
ρN ∈S(H), so that ||ρN −ρ||1 →0 as N →+∞. To this end set:

Evidently ρN ∈S(H) for any N ∈N. Since q(N)

(adding a basis of ker(ρ) ⊃ker(ρN)) give a basis of H of eigenvectors of ρ, ρN and
hence of ρ −ρN. The trace of |ρ −ρN| in that basis satisﬁes

We will show Γ is continuous for || ||1, and conclude. First of all extend Γ from
S(H) to positive trace-class operators on H, by deﬁning:
Γ1(A) := tr(A)Γ
 1
tr A A

,
Γ1(0) := 0
where A ∈B1(H), A ≥0 (so tr(A) > 0 if A ̸= 0). It follows that Γ1(A) ∈B1(H),
Γ1(A) ≥0, and:
Γ1(αA) = αΓ1(A) if α ≥0, and tr (Γ1 (A)) = tr(A) .

686
12
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
Since Γ preserves convexity, it is not hard to see
Γ1 (A + B) = Γ1(A) + Γ1(B) .
To conclude extend Γ1 to self-adjoint trace-class operators:
Γ2(A) := Γ1(A+) −Γ1(A−) ,
where A−:= −

(−∞,0) xd P(A)(x) and A+ :=

[0,+∞) xd P(A)(x). Observe A+ −
A−= A and |A| = A+ + A−by deﬁnition, since P(A) is the PVM of A.
If A ∈B1(H) is self-adjoint, then Γ2(A) belongs to B1(H) and is self-adjoint.
Moreover:
||Γ2(A)||1 ≤||Γ1(A+)||1 + ||Γ1(A−)||1 = tr (A+) + tr (A−) = ||A||1 .
Therefore Γ2 is continuous for || ||1, and so also its restriction Γ : S(H) →S(H)
is.
□
Altogether we have proved the existence of U unitary, or anti-unitary, satisfying
γ (ρ) = UρU −1 for any ρ ∈S(HSk). This ends part (a), and the proof of Kadison’s
theorem is concluded since the proof of the last statement in the thesis is trivial.
⊓⊔
Form the last part of the proof of part (a) we can extract yet another fact, interesting
by its own means.
Proposition 12.17 Let γ be a Wigner (or Kadison) automorphism of the complex
Hilbert space H, and denote by B1(H)R ⊂B1(H) the real space of trace-class
self-adjoint operators with norm || ||1.
There exist a unique continuous linear operator γ2 : B1(H)R →B1(H)R that
restricts to γ on Sp(H) (or on S(H), respectively). More precisely
||γ2(A)||1 ≤||A||1 for every A ∈B1(H)R.
Finally, γ2(A) ≥0 if A ≥0.
Proof If γ is a Kadison automorphisms, the proof is contained in Lemma 12.16,
where we proved the existence of Γ2 given Γ (above called γ2 and γ ). Uniqueness
holds because linearity implies

where the right-hand side depends on γ only (and a summand is omitted if the relevant
trace vanishes). For Wigner automorphisms the proof follows from the Kadison case,
by statement (d) in Kadison’s theorem.
⊓⊔

12.1 Deﬁnition and Characterisation of Quantum Symmetries
687
12.1.6
Dual Action and Inverse Dual Action of Symmetries
on Observables
The theorems of Wigner and Kadison enable us to deﬁne in a very elementary manner
the (dual) action of a symmetry on the observables of the physical system.
Consider a physical system S described on the Hilbert space HS. For simplicity
we shall consider the case of one sector only, as the generalisation to several coherent
sectors is immediate. We know the set L (HS) of elementary propositions on S is
described by orthogonal projectors on H. Observables on S are PVMs built with
these projectors, i.e. self-adjoint (in general unbounded) operators associated to the
PVMs.
Suppose γ : S(HS) →S(HS) is a symmetry associated with the (anti-)unitary
operator U, up to a phase. We deﬁne its dual action γ ∗: L (HS) →L (HS) on the
lattice of projectors by:
γ ∗(P) := U −1PU ,
P ∈L (HS)
(12.19)
(the arbitrary phase affecting U being irrelevant). A duality identity holds:
tr

ργ ∗(P)
	
= tr (γ (ρ)P) .
(12.20)
This follows γ (ρ) = UρU −1 by Kadison’s theorem and the fact that (when comput-
ing traces if U is anti-unitary) anti-unitary operators preserve bases.
The mapping γ ∗: L (HS) →L (HS) not only transforms orthogonal projec-
tors into orthogonal projectors, but also preserves orthocomplemented, σ-complete
bounded lattices. It is a (bounded, orthocomplemented, σ-complete) lattice auto-
morphism according to Deﬁnition 7.13. For example, the orthogonal projectors P,
Q of L (HS) commute if and only if γ ∗(P) commutes with γ ∗(Q). Moreover
γ ∗(P ∨Q) = γ ∗(P) ∨γ ∗(Q), and so on.
If A : D(A) →H is self-adjoint on H with spectral measure P(A) ⊂L (HS),
then U −1AU : U −1D(A) →HS is self-adjoint with spectral measure γ ∗
P(A)	
(see
Exercise 9.1 if unitary, Exercise 12.8 if anti-unitary). This fact allows to extend the
action of γ ∗to every observable in agreement with the spectral decomposition: just
deﬁne, for a self-adjoint operator A : D(A) →HS representing an observable of S:
γ ∗(A) := U −1AU .
(12.21)
The physical meaning of γ ∗(A) is the following. When we deﬁne a Kadison sym-
metry γ , we are prescribing an experimental procedure under which the system S
should be transformed. Mathematically speaking the action on states is described
precisely by γ : S(HS) →S(HS). The action γ ∗on observables, instead, repre-
sents operative procedures on measuring instruments which, intuitively, correspond
and generalise passive transformations of the coordinates. Better said, the procedure
is such that if we act by γ act on the system, or by γ ∗on the instrument, we obtain the

688
12
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
same result (expectation values, variances, outcome frequencies) as when we take
the measurements.
For instance, ⟨γ ∗(A)⟩ρ and ⟨A⟩γ (ρ) are equal expectation values:
⟨γ ∗(A)⟩ρ = tr

γ ∗(A)ρ
	
= tr

U−1 AUρ

= tr

AUρU−1
= tr(Aγ (ρ)) = ⟨A⟩γ (ρ) .
This is, in practice, the content of the duality Eq.(12.20). The result is equivalent to
saying that the action of γ on the system can be neutralised, concerning measurement
readings on the system, by the simultaneous action of (γ ∗)−1 on the instruments.
Another action of symmetries on observables of great relevance in physical appli-
cation is the aforementioned inverse dual action on the self-adjoint operator A (in
particular an orthogonal projector P = A)
γ ∗−1(A) := U AU −1 .
(12.22)
It plays a crucial role in Quantum Field Theory when transforming ﬁeld operators.
The meaning of γ ∗−1 is just the action of γ on instruments that neutralises the action
of γ on the system.
We shall return to these actions in Sect.12.2.2 when we deal with groups of sym-
metries, and in Sect.14.3.2 when discussing symmetries by the algebraic approach.
In the rest of the book γ ∗and γ ∗−1 will be often interpreted as maps B(HS) →
B(HS), as a matter of fact automorphisms (or anti-automorphisms if U is anti-
unitary) of B(HS), deﬁned by (12.21) and (12.22) respectively when U is given
(up to phase). The extension to many superselection sectors is trivial.
Remark 12.18 From the experimental point of view it is not obvious that a trans-
formation acting on the system can be cancelled by a simultaneous action on the
measuring instrument. Symmetries, à la Kadison or Wigner, have this property.

Example 12.19
(1) Consider a spinless quantum particle described on R3, thought of as rest space
of an inertial frame system with given positively-oriented orthonormal coordinates.
FromChap.11weknowtheparticle’sHilbertspaceis L2(R3, dx).Purestatesarethus
determined, up to arbitrary phases, by wavefunctions, i.e. by vectors ψ ∈L2(R3, dx)
such that

R3 |ψ(x)|2dx = 1.
We want to explain how the isometries of R3 determine Wigner symmetries (hence
Kadison symmetries) by the invariance of the Lebesgue measure.
The notions of group theory used in the sequel will be summarised at a later stage
(elementary facts are present in the book’s appendix). Denote by IO(3) the isometry
group of R3, which is the semidirect product (see the appendix) of O(3) with the
Abelian group of translations R3. In practice, every element Γ ∈IO(3) is a pair
Γ = (R, t) acting on R3 as follows: Γ (x) := t + Rx. The composition law of IO(3)
is:
(t′, R′) ◦(t, R) = (t′ + R′t, R′R) hence (t, R)−1 = (−R−1t, R−1) .

12.1 Deﬁnition and Characterisation of Quantum Symmetries
689
Let Γ : R3 →R3 belong to IO(3), so Γ could in particular be: a translation
Γ : R3 ∋x →x+t along an axis t, a rotation of O(3) about the origin R3 ∋x →Rx
(including rotations with negative determinant), or a combinations of the two. We
can deﬁne a transformation of square-integrable maps:
(UΓ ψ) (x) := ψ

Γ −1x
	
,
ψ ∈L2(R3, dx).
(12.23)
The operator U is clearly linear, surjective (every isometry Γ of R3 is bijective) and
isometric, as the Jacobian matrix J of an isometry has determinant ±1:
||UΓ ψ||2 =

The transformation γΓ induced by the unitary operator UΓ on states (pure or mixed)
is a symmetry (Wigner or Kadison, respectively), which naturally represents the
action of the isometry Γ on S given by the particle examined.
The map IO(3) ∋Γ →UΓ satisﬁes
Uid = I ,
UΓ UΓ ′ = UΓ ◦Γ ′ ,
Γ, Γ ′ ∈IO(3)
where id is the identity of IO(3), because of (12.23). Hence IO(3) ∋Γ →UΓ
preserves the group structure (in particular UΓ −1 = (UΓ )−1); as such it is a represen-
tation of the group IO(3) by unitary operators. We will discuss these representations
in the next section.
Take now a PVM on R3, denoted P(X), that coincides with the joint spectral
measure (see Theorem 9.19) of the three position operators:
(P(X)
E
ψ)(x) = χE(x)ψ(x) ,
ψ ∈L2(R3, dx).
It is easy to prove the position operators arise by integrating the corresponding
functions in this PVM:
Xi =

R3 xid P(X)(x) i = 1, 2, 3.
Directly from Deﬁnition (12.23) the so-called imprimitivity condition holds:
UΓ P(X)
E U −1
Γ

Γ (E) .

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
Equation (12.24) follows since ψ is arbitrary. Note that the imprimitivity equation can
be written equivalently in terms of the inverse dual action of the Kadison symmetry:
γ ∗−1
Γ

P(X)
E


Γ (E) .
In general a system of imprimitivity on X according to Mackey is given by: (i) a
PVM P on the separable complex Hilbert space H for the Borel σ-algebra of the
metrisable space X (that admits a metric making it complete and separable), (ii) a
second-countable, locally compact group G acting on X so that the action4 G× X ∋
(g, x) →gx ∈X is measurable, (iii) a unitary representation G ∋g →Vg ∈B(H)
that is strongly continuous and satisﬁes the imprimitivity condition (which is better
written using the inverse dual action of the symmetry induced by Vg):
Vg PEV −1
g
= Pg(E)
for any E ∈B(X), g ∈G .
The imprimitivity system is said to be transitive when the action of G on X is tran-
sitive, i.e. such that any two points x1, x2 ∈X can be transformed into one another,
x2 = gx1, by some g ∈G. The unitary representations of G for any imprimitiv-
ity system, up to unitary equivalence, are determined by the famous Imprimitivity
theorem of Mackey, which we shall not be concerned with (see for instance [Jau73,
Var07]).
We have veriﬁed that P(X), IO(3), U form a transitive imprimitivity system on R3
(we did not check the topological requests, which hold if we embed IO(3) in the Lie
group GL(4)). Transitivity is obvious from elementary geometry.
The action of γ ∗
Γ on the position operators can be obtained by direct computation,
in analogy to the imprimitivity condition, or using the latter to integrate the spectral
measure. Let X = (X1, X2, X3) be the column vector of the X1, X2, X3 restricted to
the common invariant Schwartz domain S (R3), where the operators are essentially
self-adjoint. Then
γ ∗
Γ (X) = U −1
Γ XUΓ = RX + tI ,
(12.25)
and in particular, considering pure translations:
γ ∗
(t,I) (X) = U −1
(t,I)XU(t,I) = X + tI ,
(12.26)
and pure rotations:
γ ∗
(0,R) (X) = U −1
(0,R)XU(0,R) = RX .
(12.27)
The element (0, −I) ∈IO(3) deﬁnes the reﬂection about the origin. The unitary
representation P := U(0,−I), and the associated Wigner (Kadison) symmetry γP,
are called parity inversion. Not so precisely, one often calls (0, −I) parity inversion.
Easily, P∗= P (so PP = I as P−1 = P∗). Therefore the inversion of parity
4The map (g, x) →gx is customarily taken so that g′(gx) = (g′g)x and ex = x for every
g, g′ ∈G, x ∈X, where e ∈G is the neutral element.

admits an associated observable, called parity, with two possible eigenvalues ±1. We
must emphasise that the unitary operator representing (0, −I) is actually deﬁned, as
usual,uptophase,sotheobservableP associatedtotheparitysymmetrycorresponds
to a speciﬁc choice of phase. There remain two possibilities for the phase, namely the
sign of the observable P, since also −P is an observable representing the inversion
of parity.
(2) Consider the system of the previous example, and let us study it via the momentum
representation. Using the Fourier–Plancherel transform, in other terms, we identify
H and L2(R3, dk), so that the three momentum observables (the components of
the momentum in the orthonormal Cartesian coordinates of the inertial frame) are
represented by the multiplication operators:

Pi 
ψ
	
(k) = ℏki 
ψ(k) ,
as we saw in Chap.11. We indicate by 
ψ = 
F(ψ) the Fourier–Plancherel transform
of ψ ∈L2(R3, dx). An extremely interesting symmetry in physics is the time rever-
sal γT , described by anti-unitary operators (later we will see why). This symmetry
corresponds to ﬂipping the sign of time, but also changing sign to particles’ velocities
and hence to their momentum. The anti-unitary operator 
T describing time reversal
can be chosen (uniquely, up to phase) thus:
 
T 
ψ
	
(k) := 
ψ(−k) ,

ψ ∈L2(R3, dk).
(12.28)
In contrast to P in the previous example, any chosen phase for 
T maintains 
T 
T =
I because 
T is anti-unitary. Nonetheless, 
T is not an observable since the operator
is not linear. Reverting to the position representation with the chosen phase, it can
be proved that the symmetry γT is associated to an anti-unitary operator
T := 
F −1 
T 
F
( 
F is the Fourier–Plancherel transform as in Chap.11), such that
(T ψ) (x) := ψ(x) ,
ψ ∈L2(R3, dx).
(12.29)
We will come back to the time-reversal symmetry in Example13.22 and determine
completely its form.
(3) Consider a particle having electric charge represented by the observable Q with
discretespectrummadebyeigenvalues±1.FixaninertialframeI ,withorthonormal
Cartesian coordinates for which the rest space is R3. Then the system’s Hilbert space
is
H = C2 ⊗L2(R3, dx) ≡L2(R3, dx) ⊕(R3, dx) ,
where ⊕denotes orthogonal sum. The canonical isomorphism between the above
spaces (cf. Example 10.27(2) as well) descends from the fact that any Ψ ∈C2 ⊗

692
12
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
L2(R3, dx) can be written:
Ψ = |+⟩⊗ψ+ + |−⟩⊗ψ−,
where {|+⟩, |−⟩} is the canonical basis of C2 made by eigenvectors of the Pauli matrix
σ3 (cf. (12.13)) with eigenvalues +1 and −1 respectively. Hence the isomorphism
reads:
L2(R3, dx)⊕(R3, dx) ∋(ψ+, ψ−) →|+⟩⊗ψ+ + |−⟩⊗ψ−∈C2 ⊗L2(R3, dx).
It preserves the Hilbert structure (the inner product) if we view L2(R3, dx)⊕(R3, dx)
as an orthogonal sum. The charge observable can be thought of as the Pauli matrix
σ3 in C2, so on the complete space
Q = σ3 ⊗I ,
where I is the identity on L2(R3, dx). The superselection rule of the charge, in this
simple situation, requires that the space split in two coherent sectors H = H+ ⊕H−,
where H± are the ±1-eigenspaces of Q. By construction, the coherent decomposition
coincides exactly with the natural:
H = L2(R3, dx) ⊕L2(R3, dx) .
Referring to the latter, admissible pure states are only those determined by vectors
(ψ, 0) or (0, ψ), with ψ ∈L2(R3, dx). Therefore the symmetry γC+, called con-
jugation of the charge from the sector H+ to the sector H−is represented by the
unitary operator C : H+ →H−:
C+ : (ψ, 0) →(0, ψ) ,
ψ ∈L2(R3, dx).
(12.30)
The symmetry γC−, called conjugation of the charge from the sector H−to the
sector H+ is similar:
C−: (0, φ) →(φ, 0) ,
φ ∈L2(R3, dx).
(12.31)
Notice that C−is the inverse of C+. Eventually, we deﬁne the Wigner symmetry
called conjugation of the charge, that acts on the entire Hilbert space (respecting
sectors) and restricts to the two above on the relative coherent spaces:
C := C+ ⊕C−.
By construction C C = I, so C = C ∗is self-adjoint. Moreover
C ∗QC = −Q
.

Symmetries as Transformations of Observables:
Symmetries as Ortho-Automorphisms and Segal
Symmetries
In this section we brieﬂy discuss the opposite approach, where quantum symmetries
are deﬁned from the start as bijective transformations of observables, as opposed to
states which preserve some relevant algebraic structures. For the sake of simplicity
we shall only consider physical systems which are not affected by superselection
rules.
Since a quantum system is mainly deﬁned by the lattice of its elementary proposi-
tions L (H), it is natural to deﬁne a symmetry of that quantum system as an automor-
phism of an orthocomplemented σ-complete lattice, according to Deﬁnition 7.13.
Remark 12.20 Proposition 7.15 establishes that an automorphism of an orthocom-
plemented lattice h : X →X is automatically an automorphism of orthocomple-
mented (σ-)complete lattices if X is (σ-)complete. Therefore a symmetry of a quan-
tum system can be deﬁned as an automorphism of the orthocomplemented lattice
L (H). In the following we shall call ortho-automorphisms the automorphisms of
an orthomodular lattice.
■
Remarkably, if the Hilbert space of the system is separable and has dimension ̸=
2, this deﬁnition is completely equivalent to the notion of Kadison and Wigner
symmetry, as we go to illustrate.
First of all observe that, if H is separable with dimension ̸= 2, every ortho-
automorphism α : L (H) →L (H) induces a Kadison automorphism. In fact, the
property α(∨j∈J Pj) = ∨j∈Jα(Pj) (Proposition 7.15) and (ii) in Theorem 7.22(b)

Gleason’s Theorem 7.26 (systems associated to separable complex Hilbert spaces of
dimension ̸= 2) each ortho-automorphism α induces a corresponding Kadison sym-
metry acting on states by a duality process. In fact, if μ : L (H) →[0, 1] is a quantum
state in the sense of axiom A2 (measure-formulation form) and α : L (H) →L (H)
satisﬁes the previous identity, μ ◦α : L (H) →[0, 1] is still a state for axiom
A2 (measure-formulation form). If the Hilbert space has dimension ̸= 2, for every
mixed state (positive trace-class operator of trace one) ρ ∈S(HS) whose associ-
ated measure is μ, there exists a unique mixed state γα(ρ) associated to μ ◦α due
to Gleason’s theorem. Therefore γα(ρ) is completely determined by the require-
ment tr (γα(ρ)P) = tr(ρα(P)) for any P ∈L (H). Then γα : S(H) →S(H)
is immediately bijective (α is) and maps convex combinations of states to convex
combinations, preserving statistical weights, and the mapping α →γα is injective.

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
Put differently, every ortho-automorphism α of the lattice of elementary proposi-
tions faithfully corresponds to a Kadison symmetry γα. An immediate consequence
of Kadison’s Theorem 12.14 is that α →γα, viewed from the set of symmetries
of observables to the set of Kadison symmetries, is surjective as well. In fact, if
γ is a Kadison symmetry on H, then there exists a unitary or anti-unitary operator
U : H →H such that γ (ρ) = UρU −1 for every ρ ∈S(H) due to the afore-
mentioned theorem. On the other hand, α : L (H) ∋P →U −1PU ∈L (H) is a
ortho-automorphism and γα = γ evidently. Finally observe that the dual action on
observables of the Kadison symmetry γα associated to the lattice automorphism α
coincides with the action of α itself:
γ ∗
α (P) = α(P) for every P ∈L (H).
(12.33)
In summary we have achieved the following result.
Proposition 12.21 For a quantum system associated to a separable Hilbert space
with dimension > 2, in absence of superselection rules, ortho-automorphisms of the
lattice of elementary propositions α and Kadison symmetries γα are in one-to-one
correspondence, and they are physically equivalent under (12.33).
Remark 12.22 The mathematical byproduct of the discussion above is the most
elementary version of Dye’s theorem.
Theorem 12.23 (Dye) If H ̸= {0} is a complex Hilbert space, separable and with
dimension ̸= 2, an ortho-automorphism of L (H) is of the form
L (H) ∋P →V PV −1 ∈L (H)
for some (unitary or anti-unitary) V : H →H. For dim H > 1, V is determined
up to a phase by the automorphism itself.
See the solution of Exercise 12.1 for the detailed proof.
■
As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, there is a another notion of quan-
tumsymmetryintroducedbySegal,thatreliesontheJordanalgebra(seeSect.11.3.3)
of operators instead of the lattice of elementary propositions. If a quantum system
is described on the complex separable Hilbert space H, in absence of superselection
rules the associated (real) Jordan algebra of observables J(HS) is the real vector
space of bounded self-adjoint operators in B(HS) equipped with the commutative,
non-associative Jordan product (11.21)
A ◦B := 1
2(AB + B A) for all A, B ∈B(HS) .
In absence of superselection rules, J(HS) contains all bounded observables of the
system S, in particular the elementary propositions of L (HS). The product ◦is the
most natural product of bounded observables, as it produces self-adjoint operators

12.1 Deﬁnition and Characterisation of Quantum Symmetries

when the factors are self-adjoint (see Sect.11.3.3). It is natural to deﬁne a notion
of symmetry which involves operators representing (bounded) observables, hence
enlarging L (HS) to the whole J(HS) and preserving the relevant algebraic structure.
We state the corresponding deﬁnition by focusing only on quantum systems not
affected by superselection rules, for the sake of simplicity.
Deﬁnition 12.24 (Segalsymmetry).Consideraquantumphysicalsystem S described
on the complex separable Hilbert space HS in absence of superselection rules. A
weak symmetry of S according to Segal (or weak Segal automorphism) is a map
σ : J(HS) →J(HS) such that:
(a) σ is bijective;
(b) σ(A ◦B) = σ(A) ◦σ(B) for A, B ∈J(HS) with AB = B A.
A weak symmetry according to Segal is said to be strong (a strong Segal auto-
morphism) if (b) is valid regardless of AB = B A.
Evidently, if U : H →H is unitary or anti-unitary, the map
J(H) ∋A →U AU −1 ∈B(H)
is a strong Segal automorphism. A natural question is whether or not this sort of
Segal automorphism exhausts all possible Segal automorphisms. The answer is once
again yes: weak and strong symmetries coincide, and also coincide with Kadison
and Wigner symmetries. The following remarkable result rephrases a statement in
[Sim76], and will not be proved.
Theorem 12.25 Every weak Segal automorphism σ : J(H) →J(H), on a complex
separable Hilbert space of dim(H) ≥2, is a strong Segal automorphism, and there
exists an either unitary or anti-unitary map U : H →H, depending on σ and deﬁned
up to phase, such that
σ(A) = U AU −1 for every A ∈J(H).
Therefore, every weak Segal automorphism σ deﬁnes a unique Wigner and Kadison
automorphism γ , the only one satisfying
γ ∗−1(A) = σ(A) for every A ∈J(H).
This means that Segal, Kadison and Wigner symmetries are physically equivalent.

tations, applied to quantum symmetry groups.

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
12.2.1
Projective and Projective Unitary Representations
Suppose we look at a group G (with product · and neutral element e) as a group
of transformations acting on a physical system S, described on the Hilbert space
HS. For simplicity we assume HS is the only coherent sector. Suppose, further, each
transformation g ∈G is associated to a symmetry γg, which we can then view as
a Kadison (or Wigner) automorphism. We have already met this setup in Example
12.6(1), where G was the isometry group of the three-dimensional rest space of an
inertial frame and S was the particle with no charge nor spin. Kadison automorphisms
in S(HS) clearly form a group under composition. Hence the idea is taking shape
that there is a representation of G in terms of Kadison automorphisms: these should
describe the action of G on the quantum states of S. In other words we can suppose
the map G ∋g →γg is a group homomorphism from G to the group of invertible
maps on S(HS):
γg·g′ = γg ◦γg′ ,
γe = id ,
γg−1 = γ −1
g
,
g, g′ ∈G,
where id is the identity automorphism. Actually, the last condition is unnecessary
because it follows from the former two by uniqueness of the inverses. We also
expect, as it happens in the majority of concrete physical cases, the representation
G ∋g →γg to be faithful, which means the homomorphism G ∋g →γg is
injective. This is very often the case in physics.
Deﬁnition 12.26 (Projective representation). Consider a quantum system S
described on the non-trivial Hilbert space HS. Let G be a group with an injective
homomorphism (a faithful representation) G ∋g →γg deﬁned by Wigner auto-
morphisms γg : Sp(HS) →Sp(HS). Then G is called a symmetry group of S, and
G ∋g →γg is its projective representation on Sp(HS).
Remarks 12.27 (1) Referring only to Wigner symmetries is not restrictive since
Kadison’s theorem (in our formulation) warrants every Wigner automorphism γg
extends, uniquely, to a Kadison automorphism γ ′
g : S(HS) →S(HS). It is straight-
forward that G ∋g →γ ′
g is an injective homomorphism, i.e. a faithful representa-
tion of G by Kadison automorphisms. Conversely, every faithful G-representation by
Kadison automorphisms determines a unique faithful G-representation by Wigner
automorphisms, by restriction to Sp(HS). In the sequel, despite mentioning Wigner
symmetries most of the times, we will think the representation G ∋g →γg as given
by Wigner or Kadison automorphisms, according to what will suit us best.
(2) The name projective representation is appropriate because Sp(Hs) is a projective
space, as we saw in Chap.7, and the map γg : Sp(HS) →Sp(HS) is well deﬁned.
(3) Since the homomorphism G ∋g →γg is explicitly required to be injective, we
can equivalently take, as group of symmetries, the set of automorphisms γg, with
g ∈G, equipped with the natural group structure coming from composition of maps.
Indeed, this group is isomorphic to G by construction.
■

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
697
Now here is an interesting issue. Suppose we have a symmetry group and a projective
representation G ∋g →γg. The map G →γg is certainly a representation, but not a
linear representation, because the γg : Sp(HS) →Sp(HS) are not linear maps. Yet
since to every automorphism γg there corresponds a unitary or anti-unitary operator
Ug : HS →HS that satisﬁes γg(ρ) = UgρU −1
g
for any ρ ∈Sp(HS), a natural
question arises: can G ∋g →Ug be an (anti)linear representation of G? Can it
be given, in other terms, by (anti)linear (unitary and/or anti-unitary) operators in
B(H)? We are equivalently asking whether G ∋g →Ug is a group homomorphism,
i.e. if it preserves the group structure:
Ug·g′ = UgUg′ ,
Ue = I ,
Ug−1 = U −1
g
for any g, g′ ∈G,
(12.34)
where I : HS →HS is the identity operator. The matter is relevant from a technical
point to view, too: the profusion of results available on linear representations over
(Hilbert) spaces can be used to study symmetry groups of quantum systems. The
answer to the preceding questions is typically negative, because the conditionUg·g′ =
UgUg′ in general fails. Namely, as γg ◦γg′ = γgg′, we have
UgUg′ρ(UgUg′)−1 = Ug·g′ρU −1
g·g′
for any ρ ∈S(HS).
Consequently:
(Ug·g′)−1UgUg′ρ(UgUg′)−1Ug·g′ = ρ ,
ρ ∈Sp(HS).
This means that (Ug·g′)−1UgUg′ deﬁnes the trivial symmetry given by the identity
operator I. Consequently, for dim(H) > 1: (a) (Ug·g′)−1Ug is linear (that is, Ug·g′
and UgUg′ are both unitary or anti-unitary) and (b) (Ug·g′)−1UgUg′ amounts to a pure
phase ω(g, g′)I depending on g, g′. This result is sharp – the best possible – because
the Ug themselves are deﬁned up to phase. Overall, if the (unitary or anti-unitary)
Ug are associated to a projective representation of a certain symmetry group, the
condition Ug·g′ = UgUg′ weakens, in the general case, to
UgUg′ = ω(g, g′)Ug·g′ ,
g, g′ ∈G,
where ω(g, g′) ∈C, |ω(g, g′)| = 1, are complex numbers depending on how the
Ug are associated to the automorphisms γg, but in any case respecting the theorems
of Wigner and Kadison.5 Therefore if, as usual, U(1) denotes the group of unit
complex numbers, ω(g, g′) ∈U(1). In particular, setting g = g′ = e, the above
implicit deﬁnition of ω(g, g′) tells
Ue = ω(e, e)I ,
(12.35)
5For dim(H) = 1, every γg coincides with the identity map and we are free to choose, for instance,
Ug = I so that ω(g, g′) = 1 for every g, g′ ∈G.

698

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
(e being the neutral element of G) hence UeρU −1
e
= ρ as it should be.
It is not at all obvious that one can redeﬁne phases so to obtain ω(g, g′) = 1 for
every g, g′ ∈G.
Remark 12.28 Henceforth we will work with unitary operators, and drop the anti-
unitary case, since this is the most common case when dealing with groups of sym-
metries. The explanation, and a further discussion, is put off until the end of the
section.
■
The functions G×G ∋(g, g′) →ω(g, g′) ∈U(1) are not totally arbitrary, because
associativity holds:
(UgUg′)Ug′′ = Ug(Ug′Ug′′) .
A computation shows that the above is equivalent to:
ω(g, g′)ω(g · g′, g′′) = ω(g, g′ · g′′)ω(g′, g′′)
(12.36)
In turn, the latter implies:
ω(g, e) = ω(e, g) ,
ω(g, e) = ω(g1, e) ,
ω(g, g−1) = ω(g−1, g) ,
g, g1 ∈G ,
(12.37)
The next deﬁnition transcends the physical meaning of the objects involved.
Deﬁnition 12.29 (Projective unitary representation). Let G be a group and H a
(complex) Hilbert space.
(a) A projective unitary representation of G on H is a map
G ∋g →Ug ∈B(H)
(12.38)
such that: Ug are unitary operators, and the multiplier of the representation
Ω(g, g′) := U −1
g·g′UgUg′ ,
g, g′ ∈G,
(12.39)
has the form
Ω(g, g′) = ω(g, g′)I
with ω(g, g′) ∈U(1) for any g, g′ ∈G
(12.40)
(hence (12.36) holds).
The projective representation on Sp(H) given by (with obvious notation)
G ∋g →Ug · U −1
g
is induced by the projective unitary representation (12.38).
The projective unitary representation (12.38) is called irreducible if the family
of operators {Ug}g∈G is irreducible on H.
Given Hilbert spaces H, H′ (possibly equal), two projective unitary representations

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
699
G ∋g →Ug ∈B(H) and G ∋g →U ′
g ∈B(H′)
are said to be (unitarily) equivalent if there exist a unitary operator S : H →H′
and a map χ : G ∋g →χ(g) ∈U(1) satisfying:
χ(g)SUgS−1 = U ′
g ,
g ∈G.
(12.41)
(b) A group homomorphism
G ∋g →Ug ∈B(H)
(12.42)
mapping elements of G to unitary operators on H is a (proper) unitary represen-
tation of G on H. (That is to say, a unitary representation is a projective unitary
representation whose multipliers equal 1.)
The unitary representation (12.42) is irreducible if the family of operators
{Ug}g∈G is irreducible on H.
Given Hilbert spaces H, H′ (possibly equal), two unitary representations
G ∋g →Ug ∈B(H) and G ∋g →U ′
g ∈B(H′)
are (unitarily) equivalent if there is a unitary operator S : H →H′ such that
SUgS−1 = U ′
g
for every g ∈G.
(12.43)
Important remark. The reader should now be able to see the difference between
projective representations, projective unitary representations and unitary represen-
tations. The ﬁrst type act on Sp(HS) or S(HS) representing symmetry groups, and
do not involve choices without physical meaning. The other two kinds act on HS,
induce projective representations, but are affected by physically arbitrary choices of
the phases of the unitary operators by which they act.
■
Remarks 12.30 (1) The notion of unitary equivalence of two projective unitary rep-
resentations is transitive, symmetric and reﬂexive, so it is an honest equivalence
relation on the space of projective unitary representations of a given group on a
given Hilbert space. If G is a symmetry group for the physical system S, described
on the Hilbert space HS, projective representations of G on Sp(HS) are patently in
one-to-one correspondence with equivalence classes of projective unitary represen-
tations of G.
(2) The property that a projective unitary representation G ∋g →Ug be equivalent
to a unitary representation is actually a property of the coset of the projective unitary
representation: it means that the equivalence class contains a unitary representative.
When talking about symmetry groups of a quantum system, that is a feature of the
projective representation on S(HS) corresponding to the class.

700
12
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
(3) The property that a projective unitary representation G ∋g →Ug be irreducible
is a property of the coset of the projective unitary representation: if one representa-
tive in the equivalence class is irreducible, all other elements are irreducible, as is
clear from the deﬁnitions. Irreducible representations are important because every
representation can be constructed as a direct sum, or direct integral, of irreducible
representations [Var07].
■
Here is a more concrete way of asking whether a projective representation G ∋g →
γg of a symmetry group G can be described, on HS, by a unitary representation of
G. Inside the equivalence class of projective unitary representations associated to
G ∋g →γg we ﬁx an arbitrary representative (the ensuing discussion does not
depend on this element, by remark (2) above) and consider its multipliers.
Thus we reduce to decide whether there might be a map χ : G ∋g →χ(g) ∈
U(1) such that:
ω(g, g′) = χ(g · g′)
χ(g)χ(g′)
for any g, g′ ∈G .
(12.44)
Proof: if said χ exists, inserting it on the left in (12.41) renders the multipliers of
G ∋g →U ′
g trivial by (12.44). Conversely, if the multipliers of G ∋g →U ′
g are
trivial for some choice of the function χ in (12.41), that particular χ solves (12.44).
There are many strategies to tackle and solve the existence problem of χ [Var07],
and one can see there exist groups, e.g. the Lorentz group and the Poincaré group,
whose projective representations are described by unitary representations on the
Hilbert space of the system. At the same time there exist other groups, like the
Galilean group, whose (non-trivial) projective representations cannot be given by
unitary representations, but only by projective unitary representations: the multipliers
cannot be suppressed by smart choices of the phases.
There is a colossal literature on the topic. Irreducible projective unitary represen-
tations of the groups of interest in physics, especially Lie groups, have been studied
and classiﬁed (e.g., see [BaRa86] for a broad, though not completely rigorous nor
mathematically complete, treatise on the subject).
12.2.2
Representations of Actions on Observables: Left and
Right Representations
Given a symmetry group G with projective representation G ∋g →γg, two func-
tions are automatically deﬁned that represent group actions on observables, namely
G ∋g →γ ∗
g and G ∋g →γ ∗−1
g
, the dual action (12.19) and the the inverse dual
action (12.22) respectively, discussed in Sect.12.1.6. The deﬁnitions hold beyond the
particular choice of projective unitary representation of the theory on the system’s
Hilbert space: the phases that we have to ﬁx to pass from γg to the Ug cancel out when
we transfer the action to observables: γ ∗
g (A) = U −1
g AUg and γ ∗−1
g
(A) = Ug AU −1
g .

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
701
Note that G ∋g →γ ∗
g does not deﬁne a left G-representation; it is easy to see,
from the deﬁnition of γ ∗
g , that:
γ ∗
g ◦γ ∗
g′ = γ ∗
g′·g ,
g, g′ ∈G
by construction, and not γ ∗
g γ ∗
g′ = γ ∗
g·g′. Furthermore, γ ∗
e = id and γ ∗
g−1 = (γ ∗
g )−1.
The function G ∋g →γ ∗
g is a right representation of G, provided we endow
observables with the structure of a vector space at least – for instance restricting to
(self-adjoint) operators in B(HS).
Deﬁnition 12.31 Let G have neutral element e. A (linear) right representation of
G on a (real or complex) vector space V is a map G ∋g →αg ∈GL(V ) such that
αa ◦αb = αb·a ,
αe = id ,
(αc)−1 = αc−1
for any a, b, c ∈G.
The inverse dual action γ ∗−1

of G as the reader immediately proves:

12.2.3
Projective Representations and Anti-unitary Operators
Letusreturntothe‘unitaryvs.anti-unitary’issueoftheoperatorsUg.Supposetohave
a symmetry group with projective representation G ∋g →γg. To an automorphism
γg there corresponds either a unitary operator or an anti-unitary operator Ug : HS →
HS satisfying γg(ρ) = UgρU −1
g
for every ρ ∈Sp(HS), by Wigner’s theorem. Are
there criteria to decide whether the Ug are all unitary, all anti-unitary, or maybe
both depending on g ∈G? If Ug and Ug′ were anti-unitary, the constraint UgUg′ =
χ(g, g′)Ug·g′ would force Ug·g′ to be unitary. Therefore representations of groups
withmorethantwoelements,allmadebyanti-unitaryoperators(identityapart,which
is always unitary) cannot exist. The hybrid case when a certain number of anti-unitary
operators (more than one) are present is anyway non-trivial, due to constraints such
as the aforementioned one. In this respect the next proposition shows that the group
G might impose the operators be all unitary.
Proposition 12.32 Let H be a complex Hilbert space with dim H > 1 and G a group.
Suppose each g ∈G is the product of elements g1, g2, . . . , gn ∈G (dependent on
g, with n dependent on g) that admit a square root (there exist rk ∈G such that
gk = rk · rk for every k = 1, . . . , n). Then for every projective representation
G ∋g →γg, the elements γg can only be associated to unitary operators under
Wigner’s theorem (or Kadison’s).

702

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
Proof The proof is obvious, for UrkUrk is linear even when Urk is antilinear. As
Ugk and UrkUrk represent the same Wigner symmetry associated to gk = rk · rk,
they are both unitary or anti-unitary and hence they differ by a phase. From Ugk =
χ(rk,rk)UrkUrk follows Ugk is linear, so also Ug must be linear.
⊓⊔
Remark 12.33 The case dim H = 1 has no direct physical interest as each symmetry
γg must be the identity. In particular, G ∋g →γg can always be unitarily represented
by the trivial representation Ug = I for all g ∈G. Nevertheless, the case dim H = 1
may result mathematically interesting, and in the following we will also consider the
case of (non-trivial) unitary representations on one-dimensional spaces.
■
The following result is important in the applications, especially the case n = 1.
Proposition 12.34 In relationship to Proposition 12.32, the projective representa-
tions of the additive group G = Rn are associated to unitary operators only.
Proof If t ∈Rn then t = t/2 + t/2, and the rest is a corollary of Proposition 12.32.
⊓⊔
We shall see later that Proposition 12.32 is automatic when we assume G is a con-
nected Lie group, so anti-unitary operators appear only with discrete groups or when
we change connected component. For this reason in the sequel we will deal with the
case where the Ug are all unitary.
12.2.4
Central Extensions and Quantum Group Associated to
a Symmetry Group
The approach we are about to illustrate allows to study all projective unitary represen-
tations of a certain group, by looking at them as restrictions of unitary representations
of a larger group, a central extension of the starting one. The recipe, albeit apparently
overcomplicated, is technically useful (also to detect possible unitary representations
of G) in that it lets us use the speciﬁc toolbox of the much developed theory of uni-
tary representations (of the extension). Let us brieﬂy explain the basic idea of the
procedure, postponing the fundamental example where G is the Galilean group; the
reader might skip this section at ﬁrst and return to it when needed.
Take any group G and a projective unitary representation G ∋g →Ug on a
Hilbert space H with multipliers ω. Deﬁne another group Gω consisting of pairs
(χ, g) ∈U(1) × G with product:
(χ, g) ◦(χ′, g′) =

χχ′ω(g, g′) , g · g′	
,
(χ, g), (χ′, g′) ∈U(1) × G.
The reader can check the deﬁnition is well posed, owing to the fact ω satisﬁes (12.36),
and that it produces a group with neutral element (ω(e, e)−1, e), e being the neutral
element of G (remember (12.37)), and inverse

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
703
(χ, g)−1 = (χ−1ω(e, e)−1ω(g, g−1)−1, g−1) .
The following deﬁnition disregards the origin of the function ω, and only requires
Eq.(12.36) to be valid.
Deﬁnition 12.35 (Central extension). Let G be a group and ω : G × G →U(1)
any function satisfying (12.36). The group Gω = U(1) × G with product
(χ, g) ◦(χ′, g) =

χχ′ω(g, g′) , g · g′	
,
(χ, g), (χ′, g′) ∈U(1) × G,
is a central extension of G by U(1) with multiplier function ω. The injective map
U(1) ∋χ →(χ, e) ∈Gω andthesurjectivehomomorphism Gω ∋(χ, g) →g ∈G
are respectively called canonical injection and canonical projection of the central
extension.
The names (see the appendix at the end of the book for a minimal dictionary of group
theory) come about as follows: the canonical projection Gω ∋(χ, g) →g ∈G is
a surjective homomorphism, whose null space is the normal subgroup N (range of
the canonical injection and isomorphic to U(1)) of pairs (χ, e) with χ ∈U(1). The
kernel N is contained in the centre of Gω, as its elements commute with the whole
Gω (in fact ω(e, g) = ω(g, e)). In practice the group G has been extended, to Gω,
by adding the kernel of the surjection Gω ∋(χ, g) →g ∈G), which is central.
Notice that G is naturally identiﬁed with the quotient group Gω/N .
The procedure for obtaining all projective unitary representations G ∋g →Ug
of G relies on three important points.
(1) If G ∋g →Ug has multiplier function ω, the map
Gω ∋(χ, g) →V(χ,g) := χUg ,
is a unitary Gω-representation on H. In fact the operators V(χ,g) : H →H are unitary,
so V(ω(e,e)−1,e) = I and
V(χ,g)V(χ′,g′) = χUgχ′Ug′ = χχ′ω(g, g′)Ug·g′ = V(χ,g)◦(χ′,g′) .
(2)Theinitialrepresentationarisesfromtheunitaryrepresentation Gω ∋(χ, g) →
V(χ,g) by restriction: i.e., restricting the domain of V to elements (1, g), g ∈G. We
will say that the unitary representation V restricts to G in this case.
(3) Given any unitary representation
Gω ∋(χ, g) →V(χ,g)
of a central extension, the restriction to {1} × G, say Ug := V(1,g), is a projective
unitary representation if and only if:
V(χ,e) = χω(e, e)I
for every χ ∈U(1).
(12.45)

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
In fact, V(χ,g) = χUg implies V(χ,e) = χUe = χω(e, e)I (for any projective unitary
representation ω(e, e) := U −1
ee UeUe = Ue). From (χ, g) = (χω(e, e)−1, e)(1, g),
conversely, if (12.45) holds we can write
V (χ, g) = V (χω(e, e)−1, e)V (1, g) = χV (1, g) =: χUg .
So we have this proposition.
Proposition 12.36 Every projective unitary representation of a group G is the
restriction of a unitary representation of a suitable central extension Gω whose
multiplier function satisﬁes (12.45).
The extension procedure, especially when G is a Lie group, is extremely powerful.
Cohomology techniques enable to catalogue all projective unitary representations
that are continuous in some topology (and all unitary representations of a simply
connected Lie group) starting from the Lie algebra of G. We will return here at a
later stage.
As a matter of fact we need not know all central extensions of G to classify projec-
tive unitary representations. It sufﬁces to know central extensions whose multipliers
are non-equivalent. Two multiplier functions on the same group, G×G ∋(g, g′) →
ω(g, g′) ∈U(1) and G × G ∋(g, g′) →ω′(g, g′) ∈U(1), are called equivalent if
there is a map χ : G →U(1) such that
ω(g, g′) = χ(g · g′)
χ(g)χ(g′) ω′(g, g′) ,
g, g′ ∈G.
If two projective unitary representations U, U ′ of G are equivalent, they are restric-
tions of unitary representations of central extensions Gω, Gω′ with equivalent multi-
plier functions ω, ω′. Hence, by knowing central extensions of G whose multipliers
are not equivalent and their unitary representations, we actually know the equiva-
lence classes of projective unitary representations of G, and so all projective unitary
representations of G.
Further, if ω(e, e) ̸= 1 for a certain ω, using an equivalence transformation by
a constant function χ we can reduce to the case ω(e, e) = 1. Multipliers such that
ω(e, e) = 1 (whence ω(e, g) = ω(g, e) = ω(e, e) = 1) are normalised. In this
case the canonical injection turns out to be a group homomorphism. The central
extension has neutral element (1, e), and (12.45) reads
V(χ,e) = χ I ,
χ ∈U(1) .
(12.46)
Projective unitary representations arising thus satisfy Ue = I.
To ﬁnish, we make a few physical considerations on the meaning of Gω, when there
are no unitary representations of G, only projective unitary representations. Suppose
we have a symmetry group G ∋g →γg for the physical system S, hence a projective
representation on S(HS), that is not describable by means of a unitary representation.
We can anyway choose phases arbitrarily and extend G to Gω using the multipliers

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups

found, and then take Gω as the true symmetry group of S. The latter admits in this
way two representations. One from G itself:
Gω ∋(χ, g) →g ∈G ,
that captures the classical action of the group. But there is also a quantum and unitary
representation:
Gω ∋(χ, g) →χUg ,
describing the group action on the states of the system (actually on the system’s
Hilbert space, and so on states, too).
In this light the group Gω is sometimes called the quantum group associated to
G. Note, however, that a speciﬁc central extension Gω cannot be selected using the
construction seen above, for which only projective representations given by Wigner
or Kadison automorphisms have a physical meaning. In order to choose among the
various central extensions it is necessary to give a physical meaning to the single pro-
jective unitary representations of G, or to the unitary representations of the possible
extensions Gω. This can be done, by enriching G and turning it into a Lie group, as
we will see. For the projective unitary representations of the Galilean group, multi-
pliers have a straightforward meaning, for they are related to the mass of the physical
system. This will be all the more clear after discussing Lie groups of symmetries.
12.2.5
Topological Symmetry Groups
We turn to topological symmetry groups and Lie groups of symmetries. Lie groups
are a subclass of topological groups. The majority of quantum symmetry groups, with
the notable exclusion of discrete symmetries (parity inversion and time reversal) in
particular, are Lie groups. We will study in depth the additive Lie group R, whose
importance should not go amiss, both physically and technically.
Deﬁnition 12.37 A topological group is a group G and a topological space at the
same time, whose operations of product G×G ∋( f, g) →f · g ∈G, and inversion
G ∋g →g−1, are continuous in the product topology of G × G and the topology
of G, respectively.
The theory of topological groups and their representations occupies a huge chapter
of mathematics [NaSt82], and we shall be just concerned with a few very elemen-
tary results that beﬁt our physical models. We present below some examples and
properties of topological groups, with an eye to the Haar measure.
Example 12.38
(1) The real general linear group GL(n, R) and the complex general linear group
GL(n, C) of non-singular n ×n real and complex matrices, are (evident) topological
groups, if we equip them with the topology induced by Rn2 and Cn2.

706
12
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
(2) Using the standard topology any subgroup of the above two is a topological group.
For instance:
• the unitary group
U(n) = {U ∈GL(n, C) | UU ∗= I},
• the special unitary group
SU(n) := {U ∈U(n) | det U = 1},6
• the orthogonal group
O(n) := {R ∈GL(n, R) | RRt = I}
• the special orthogonal group
SO(n) := {R ∈O(n) | det R = 1},
• the special linear group
SL(n, R) := {A ∈GL(n) | det A = 1},
• the Lorentz group (η := diag(−1, 1, 1, 1))
O(1, 3) := {Λ ∈GL(4) | ΛηΛt = η}
• the orthochronous Lorentz group
O(1, 3)↑:= {Λ ∈O(1, 3) | Λ11 > 0},
• the special orthochronous Lorentz group
SO(1, 3)↑:= {Λ ∈O(1, 3)↑| det Λ > 0}.
The list (including GL(n, R) and GL(n, C)) is made of closed subsets in Rn2, or
Cn2 if matrices are complex. This comes from the deﬁnitions: just notice that by
continuity every sequence in one of those groups converges in Rn2, or Cn2, to an
element of the group.
The groups O(n), SO(n),U(n), SU(n) (not the others listed above) are bounded,
and therefore compact groups. Boundedness follows from the deﬁnition and the
Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. For example, for U ∈U(n) we have n
k=1 UikU jk =
δi j by deﬁnition of U(n). Hence n
i,k=1 UikUik = n, so n
i,k=1 |Uik|2 = n and U(n)
is contained in the closed ball of radius √n in Cn2.
(3) Some groups do not look like matrix groups, like the additive group R. But it, too,
just like the isometry group of Rn, I O(n), built as in Example 12.19(1) replacing
O(3) with O(n), can be realised by matrices. For I O(n), one representation is by
real (n + 1) × (n + 1) matrices
M((R, t)) :=
 1 0t
t R

,
t ∈Rn, R ∈O(n)
(12.47)
(a subgroup of the topological group GL(n + 1, R) with induced topology). The
map I O(n) ∋(R, t) →M((R, t)) is an isomorphism. The additive group Rn arises
by restriction, via the homeomorphism Rn ∋t →M((I, t)) (Rn with standard
structure).
The Galilean group (Sect.12.3.3) and the Poincaré group are topological groups,
built analogously via matrices.
6The word special, for matrix groups, indicates determinant equal to 1, and is alwaysdenoted by
an S before the group’s name.

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
707
(4) Yet there exist topological groups (even Lie groups) that cannot be viewed
as matrix groups, an example being the universal covering (Deﬁnition 12.54) of
SL(2, R).
(5) Locally compact Hausdorff groups, like Rn (an Abelian group with the sum
as composition law), GL(n, R), GL(n, C) and subgroups thereof, admit a special
regular Borel measure, called the Haar measure. The Haar measure is deﬁned up to
a factor and is translation-invariant by group elements.
Its deﬁnition is contained in the following classical theorem, proved by Weil in
full generality [Hal69], of which we provide no proof. Recall that if G has product
◦, the left and right orbits of B ⊂G under g ∈G are:
gB := {g ◦b | b ∈B} and
Bg := {b ◦g | b ∈B}
respectively. A positive σ-additive measure μ on the Borel σ-algebra B(G) of the
locally compact Hausdorff group G is called left-invariant if
μ(gB) = μ(B) for any B ∈B(G), g ∈G,
and right-invariant if
μ(Bg) = μ(B) for any B ∈B(G), g ∈G.
Note that μ(gB), μ(Bg) are well deﬁned. Since the multiplication by h ∈G on the
left, G ∋b →fh(b) := h ◦b, is an homeomorphism, and since gB = ( fg−1)−1(B),
we have gB ∈B(G) if B ∈G. Similarly Bg ∈B(G) if B ∈G.
Theorem 12.39 Let G be a locally compact Hausdorff group. Up to a positive
factor, there exists a unique positive σ-additive measure μG on the Borel σ-algebra
B(G) such that it is regular (μG(B) = inf{μG(U) | B ⊂U, Uopen} and μG(B) =
sup{μG(K) | K ⊂B, Kcompact}) and:
(i) μG is left-invariant,
(ii) μG(B) > 0 if B ̸= ∅is open and μG(K) < +∞if K is compact.7
Furthermore,ifGiscompact,μG isalsoright-invariantbecauseμG(E) = μG(E−1),
where E−1 := {g−1 | g ∈E} for any E ∈B(G).
μG is called left-invariant Haar measure of G.
Asimilarresultforright-invariantmeasuresdeﬁnes,uptotheusualpositivefactor,the
right-invariant Haar measure νG. This in general is different (factor apart) from
the (left-invariant) Haar measure μG: they coincide in case G is compact, by the
theorem, because ν(E) := μ(E−1) is right-invariant on B(G) if μ is left-invariant
on B(G). If so, one speaks of the bi-invariant Haar measure.
The Abelian group (R, +) has the Lebesgue measure as Haar measure: the left-
and right-invariant Haar measures coincide. The group GL(n, R) (and its subgroups
of (2)) has Haar measure:
7Some authors require the condition on compact sets in the deﬁnition of regular Borel measure.

■
At this point we want to specialise the notion of symmetry group to topological
groups, which entails imposing topological constraints on the associated projective
representation.
Suppose we have a symmetry group G ∋g →γg for the quantum system
S described on the Hilbert space HS. If G is a topological group, we expect the
homomorphism g →γg to be continuous in some sense. This means choosing
a topology on the space of maps γg, which we may think of as either Kadison
automorphisms or Wigner automorphisms. In the sequel we adopt Wigner’s point of
view. We give ﬁrst the deﬁnition and then explain it mathematically and physically.
Deﬁnition 12.40 Consider a quantum system S described on the Hilbert space HS.
Let G be a topological group with a projective representation G ∋g →γg on H,
such that
lim
g→g0 tr

ρ1γg(ρ2)
	
= tr

ρ1γg0(ρ2)
	
,
g0 ∈G, ρ1, ρ2 ∈Sp(HS).
Then G is a topological group of symmetries for S, and G ∋g →γg is a continuous
projective representation on Sp(HS).
Physically this is reasonable, for it says the transition probability between two pure
states, one of which is the image of the action of the symmetry group, is a continuous
map for the action. In Wigner’s quantum-symmetry setup, this is more than sound.
But the deﬁnition is also natural in mathematical terms, as we explain now. Let
B1(HS)R be the real vector space of self-adjoint, trace-class operators with norm
|| ||1. By Proposition 12.17 every Wigner automorphism γg is the restriction to
Sp(HS) of a linear operator (γ2)g : B1(HS)R →B1(HS)R, determined by γg and
continuous for || ||1. Consider then the mapping Γ : G ∋g →(γ2)g. Putting the
strong topology on B1(HS)R and the standard one on the domain, we will say Γ is
continuous if for any ρ ∈B1(HS), g0 ∈G:
lim
g→g0 ||(γ2)g(ρ) −(γ2)g0(ρ)||1 = 0 .
NowrestricttoSp(HS)withtheinducedtopology,thusrevertingtotherepresentation
G ∋g →γg in terms of Wigner automorphisms. Then G ∋g →γg is continuous
if, for any ρ ∈Sp(HS), g0 ∈G:
lim
g→g0 ||γg(ρ) −γg0(ρ)||1 = 0 .
This notion of continuity is, apparently, different from that of Deﬁnition 12.40. The
next proposition tells they are indeed the same.

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
709
Proposition 12.41 Let H be a complex Hilbert space and ||ρ||1 = tr(|ρ|) the norm
on trace-class operators S(HS). Then restricting to pure states:
||ρ −ρ′||1 = 2

1 −(tr(ρρ′))2 ,
ρ, ρ′ ∈Sp(H).
(12.48)
Equivalently:
||ψ(ψ| ) −ψ′(ψ′| )||1 = 2

1 −|(ψ|ψ′)|2 ,
ψ, ψ′ ∈H, ||ψ|| = ||ψ′|| = 1.
(12.49)
Therefore Sp(H) is a metric space with distance function:
d(ρ, ρ′) := 2

1 −(tr(ρρ′))2 ,
ρ, ρ′ ∈Sp(H).
Proof The ﬁrst assertion is a trivial transcription of the second one, and the third is
obvious once the ﬁrst two are proven, by general properties of norms. To prove the
second statement in the non-trivial case ψ(ψ| ) ̸= ψ′(ψ′| ), it sufﬁces to observe that
ρ = ψ(ψ| ) −ψ′(ψ′| ), viewed as an operator in the span of ψ, ψ′, is self-adjoint
with zero trace, so its eigenvalues are ±λ for some λ > 0. Hence
2λ2 = tr(ρ2) = 2 −2|(ψ|ψ′)|2 ,
where we have expanded the trace of ρ2 in a Hilbert basis to obtain the second
identity. We conclude that λ =

1 −|(ψ|ψ′)|2, so
||ψ(ψ| ) −ψ′(ψ′| )||1 = λ + | −λ| = 2

1 −|(ψ|ψ′)|2 .
⊓⊔
Remarks 12.42 (1) The last claim of the proposition is quite interesting, for Sp(H)
is not a normed space, not even being a vector space. Nonetheless, it is a metric
space (Deﬁnition 2.82) and the distance has a meaning: it is related to the probability
amplitude.
(2) By direct inspection one also sees that, referring to the Hilbert–Schmidt norm
|| · ||2 (Deﬁnition 4.24),
||ψ(ψ| ) −ψ′(ψ′| )||2 =
√
2

1 −|(ψ|ψ′)|2 = ||ψ(ψ| ) −ψ′(ψ′| )||1/
√
2 ,
for any pair of vectors ψ, ψ′ with ||ψ|| = ||ψ′|| = 1. So, up to a multiplicative
constant, the distance on Sp(HS) constructed out of the Hilbert–Schmidt norm is
the same as the distance constructed out of || · ||1.

Mathematics and physics eventually meet in the next result.

HS. Let G be a topological group. A projective representation G ∋g →γg on H is

continuous according to Deﬁnition 12.40, so G is a topological symmetry group for
S, if and only if it is continuous with respect to:
(i) the topology of G on the domain,
(ii) the strong topology on the codomain, restricted to Sp(HS):
lim

ρ ∈Sp(HS), g0 ∈G.

Strongly Continuous Projective Unitary
Representations
Consider a physical system S described on the Hilbert space HS, a topological sym-
metry group G and a projective representation G ∋g →γg. Let us associate to G
a projective unitary representation G ∋g →Vg, in the sense γg(ρ) = VgρV −1
g ,
for every pure state ρ ∈Sp(HS) of the system and every element g ∈G. Clearly if
G ∋g →Vg is strongly continuous, then G ∋g →γg is a continuous projective
representation: Deﬁnition 12.40 holds, in fact, since if ρi = ψi(ψi| ), i = 1, 2:
tr

ρ1Vgρ2V ∗
g
	
= |(ψ1|Vgψ2)| →|(ψ1|Vg0ψ2)| = tr

ρ1Vg0ρ2V ∗

as g →g0 .
Here is an interesting problem: knowing G ∋g →γg is continuous, establish if the
phases χg of the unitary operators Ug = χgVg can be ﬁxed so to obtain a projective
unitary representation G ∋g →Ug (yet associated to the initial G ∋g →γg) that
is strongly continuous. We would like, in other words,
Ugψ →Ug0ψ
as g →g0 for any ψ ∈H.
In its general form the question is very hard, although Wigner gave a local answer.
We will show that given a topological symmetry group G and a continuous projective
representation G ∋g →γg, it is possible to ﬁx the multipliers ω so to make the
projective unitary representation G ∋g →Ug become strongly continuous on a
neighbourhood of the neutral element of G. Moreover, also the multipliers will be
continuous on that neighbourhood. This local result is not usually global. We will
prove that for G = R the result holds everywhere on the group and multipliers
can be ﬁxed to 1, so that the representation is simultaneously unitary and strongly
continuous. The consequences in physics reach far: we will be able to justify the
postulate of time evolution, and explain the relationship between the existence of
symmetries and the presence of preserved quantities as the system S evolves in time:
a quantum formulation, in other words, of Noether’s theorem. All this later though,
because now we shall focus on mathematical aspects.
Proposition 12.44 Consider a quantum system S described on the Hilbert space
HS, and let G be a topological group with continuous projective representation
γ : G ∋g →γg.
There exist an open neighbourhood A ⊂G of e ∈G and a projective unitary
representation associated to γ , G ∋g →Ug, that is strongly continuous on A.
The multipliers
ω(g, g′)I =

Ug·g′	−1 UgUg′ ,
g, g′ ∈G
deﬁne a continuous map on an open neighbourhood A′ of e with A′ · A′ ⊂A.

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
Proof Fix φ ∈H, ||φ|| = 1. As G ∋g →tr(φ(φ| )γg(φ(φ| ))) is continuous and
equals 1 for g = e, there is an open neighbourhood A0 of e where
tr(φ(φ| )γg(φ(φ| ))) ̸= 0 .
Represent γ by a projective unitary representation V , arbitrarily chosen, which we
have by Wigner’s theorem. Around A0, then:
0 ̸= tr(φ(φ| )γg(φ(φ| ))) = |(φ|Vgφ)|2 .
Deﬁne ((φ|Vgφ) ̸= 0 guarantees it is possible):
χg := (φ|Vgφ)
|(φ|Vgφ)|
and pass to a new projective unitary representation U:
Ug := χgVg ,
if g ∈A0 and
Ug := Vg ,
if g /∈A0 .
Then on A0:
0 < |(φ|Vgφ)|2
|(φ|Vgφ)| = (φ|Ugφ)
so
0 < (φ|Ugφ) .
(12.51)
Equation (12.51) has two consequences on some open neighbourhood A of e, A ⊂
A0:
Ue = 1 ,
and Ug−1 = U −1
g
,
g ∈A.
(12.52)
In fact, Ue = χ I for some χ ∈U(1), so (φ|Ueφ) = χ(φ|φ) = χ. As (φ|Ueφ) > 0,
we can only have χ = 1. As for the second property, Ug−1 = χ′
gU −1
g
for some χ′
g ∈
U(1). Since g →g−1 is continuous and e−1 = e, there is an open neighbourhood
of e, A ⊂A0, for which g−1 ∈A0 if g ∈A. Working on A,
0 < (φ|Ug−1φ) = χ′
g(φ|U −1
g φ) = χ′
g(φ|U ∗
g φ) = χ′
g(Ugφ|φ) = χ′
g(φ|Ugφ)
because (φ|Ugφ) is real so (φ|Ugφ) = (Ugφ|φ). Since (φ|Ugφ) > 0, necessarily
χ′
g = 1. This proves (12.52).
Fix a unit vector ψ ∈H, possibly distinct from the above φ. By continuity of γ ,
as in Deﬁnition 12.40 with ρ1 = Usψ(Usψ| ) and ρ2 = ψ(ψ| ), we ﬁnd
lim
r→s |(Urψ|Usψ)| = |(Usψ|Usψ)| = 1 .
(12.53)

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
713
Choosing ρ1 = φ(φ| ), ρ2 = ψ(ψ| ) gives
lim
r→s |(φ|Urψ)| = |(φ|Usψ)| .
(12.54)
Substituting in the general identities produces
||Usψ −(Urψ|Usψ)Urψ||2 = 1 −|(Urψ|Usψ)|2 ,
(12.55)
so
lim
r→s(Urψ|Usψ)Urψ = Usψ
(12.56)
and in particular, for ψ = φ,
lim
r→s(Urφ|Usφ)(φ|Urφ) = (φ|Usφ) .
(12.57)
On the other hand, our choice of φ and of the phase in U implies
lim
r→s(φ|Urφ) = lim
r→s |(φ|Urφ)| = |(φ|Usφ)| = (φ|Usφ) ,
(12.58)
and so using (12.58) in (12.57), tells
lim
r→s(Urφ|Usφ) = 1 .
(12.59)
Now, Ut is unitary, and for any ψ ∈H (any ψ = φ) we have
||Urψ −Usψ||2 = 2 −2Re(Urψ|Usψ) ,
(12.60)
so (12.59) and (12.60) imply, for r ∈A, that the map r →Urφ is continuous, with
the chosen φ. Therefore r →(Ur)−1φ is continuous, since (12.57) holds when r
is replaced by r−1 and s by s−1 (g →g−1 is continuous, and (Ur)−1 = Ur−1 by
(12.52)). From (12.56) follows
lim
r→s(Urψ|Usψ)((Ur)−1φ|ψ) = (φ|Usψ) .
In other words,
lim
r→s(Urψ|Usψ)(φ|Urψ) = (φ|Usψ) .
(12.61)
If ψ is a unit vector with (φ|Usψ) ̸= 0, (12.61) entails
lim
r→s(Urψ|Usψ) = 1 .
(12.62)
Using this result in (12.60) we establish

(12.63)
for the vectors ψ. Notice that (12.63) trivially extends to every ψ ∈H with
(φ|Usψ) ̸= 0 even if its norm is not 1 and, obviously, it is also valid for ψ = 0.
In case (φ|Usψ) = 0, (12.63) holds however with ψ replaced by ψ′ := ψ+U −1
s φ,
since it satisﬁes (φ|Usψ′) ̸= 0 by direct inspection. With this choice we have by
construction
Urψ −Usψ = (Urψ′ −Usψ′) + (UrU −1
s φ −φ) .
The ﬁrst difference in the right-hand side vanishes when r →s since (12.63) is valid
for ψ′, the second difference vanishes as well because
||UrU −1
s φ −φ|| = ||U −1
s φ −U −1
r φ|| →0 asr →s,
as established at the beginning of this proof. We conclude that (12.63) holds for every
ψ ∈H and A ∋g →Ug is strongly continuous.
Now the second claim. From U(e) = 1 and Ug−1 = U −1
g , on A we have
ω(g, e) = ω(e, g) = 1 ,
(12.64)
From

A Special Case: The Topological Group R
We prove in this section a very important theorem about continuous representations
of the additive group R equipped with the standard topology. The result is crucial in
physics, as we will have time to explain.
Theorem 12.45 Let R ∋r →γr be a continuous projective representation of R on
the Hilbert space H.
(a) There exists a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group (Deﬁnition 9.26)
R ∋r →Wr such that
γr(ρ) = WrρW −1
r
for anyr ∈R, ρ ∈Sp(H).
(12.66)

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
715
(b) A second strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group R ∋r →Ur satisﬁes
(12.66) (with Ur replacing Wr) if and only if there exists c ∈R such that
Ur = eicrWr
for anyr ∈R.
(c) There exists a self-adjoint operator A : D(A) →H on H, unique up to additive
constants, such that:
γr(ρ) = eir Aρe−ir A for anyr ∈R, ρ ∈Sp(H).
Proof (a) Let [−b, b] ⊂A, b > 0, be an interval in the open neighbourhood of 0,
say A ⊂R, satisfying Proposition 12.44 for G = R. Decompose R into the disjoint
union of intervals (na, (n + 1)a], n ∈Z, with a = b/2. Any r ∈R belongs to one
interval only, so r = nra + tr for unique tr ∈(0, a] and nr ∈Z. Since γxγy = γx+y:
γr = γnra+tr = (γa)nr γtr .
Hence if R ∋r →Ur is the projective unitary representation of Proposition 12.44:
γr(ρ) =

(Ua)nrUtr
	
ρ

(Ua)nrUtr
	−1 ,
for every ρ ∈Sp(HS). For every t ∈(−a −ε, a + ε) and some ε > 0 the map
t →Ut is strongly continuous, so
R ∋r →Vr
with Vr := (Ua)nrUtr , nr ∈Z and tr ∈(0, a] as above
(12.67)
is strongly continuous almost everywhere. The only discontinuities can occur at the
endpoints of the intervals (na, (n + 1)a]. Consider then r ∈(na, (n + 1)a] and let
us verify Vr is continuous at na. With r−< na, r+ > na we have
Vr−ψ = (Ua)(n−1)Utr−ψ
and
Vr+ψ = (Ua)nUtr+ ψ .
As (−a, a] ∋t →Utψ is continuous, by deﬁnition of V :
lim
r−→na−Vr−ψ = Vnaψ .
To prove that the map R ∋r →Vr deﬁned in (12.67) is continuous at na we also need
to check that the right and left limits coincide, i.e. that the limit of (Ua)(n−1)Utr−ψ,
as tr−→a−(computed above), coincides with the limit of (Ua)nUtr+ ψ as tr+ →0+.
We have
lim
t→a−(Ua)n−1Utψ =

t−a→0−(Ua)n−1ω(a, t −a)−1UaUt−aψ

lim
t−a→0−ω(a, t −a)−1(Ua)nUt−aψ = lim
τ→0−ω(a, τ)−1(Ua)nUτψ .
By the previous proof (0, a] ∋τ →ω(a, τ)−1 is continuous, sincea, τ, a+τ ∈A by
construction. Moreover, χ(a, 0) = 1 from (12.64). We also know (0, a] ∋t →Utψ
is continuous, so:
lim
t→a−(Ua)n−1Utψ = lim
τ→0−ω(a, τ)−1(Ua)nUτψ = lim
τ→0+ ω(a, τ)−1(Ua)nUτψ
= lim

We have proved

lim
tr−→a−(Ua)(n−1)Utr−ψ =

as required. Note (Vr)−1 = (Utr )−1(Ua)−nr = U−tr (Ua)−nr , where the second iden-
tity in (12.52) was used. In analogy to the proof for Vr, also R ∋r →(Vr)−1 is
continuous in the strong topology.
We claim the multipliers of V can be set to 1. For this, ﬁrst we will show they
give a continuous map R2 ∋(r, s) →ω(r, s) ∈U(1), using that R ∋t →Vtψ
and R ∋t →(Vt)−1ψ are continuous. Then we will prove the latter function is
equivalent to the constant map 1. By deﬁnition
ω(r, s)Vr+s = VrVs .
Fix (r0, s0) ∈R2. There must exist ψ, φ ∈H\{0} so that (ψ|Vr0+s0φ) ̸= 0, otherwise
Vr0+s0 = 0, which is impossible by hypothesis as Vt is unitary. By continuity there
is a neighbourhood B of (r0, s0) such that (r, s) ∈B implies (ψ|Vr+sφ) ̸= 0. Then
ω(r, s) = ((Vr)−1ψ|Vsφ)
(ψ|Vr+sφ)
.
Hence R2 ∋(r, s) →ω(r, s) ∈U(1) is continuous around (r0, s0), and so contin-
uous on R2. We may write ω(r, s) = e−i f (r,s) for some function f : R2 →R. The
continuous map ω can be thought of as valued in the unit circle S1, homeomorphic
to U(1). The map f can be chosen to be continuous (the fundamental group of R2 is
trivial, so the lifting property of covering spaces holds, cf. [Ser94II, Theorem 18.2]).
Equation (12.36) now reads
f (s, t) −f (r + s, t) + f (r, s + t) −f (r, s) = 2πkr,s,t
forkr,s,t ∈Z .
Continuous functions map connected sets (R3) to connected sets (a subset of 2πZ
with induced standard topology), so the right-hand side is constant. But the left-hand
side is zero for r = s = t = 0 as a consequence of (12.64), so:

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
717
f (s, t) −f (r + s, t) + f (r, s + t) −f (r, s) = 0 for everyr, s, t ∈R . (12.68)

The new representation Wr := χ(r)Vr has multiplier ω′(r, s) = ω(r, s) χ(r)χ(s)
χ(r+s) , so
ω(r, s)′ = e−i f ′(r,s)
where
f ′(r, s) = f (r, s) −h(r + s) + h(r) + h(s) .

eventually gives f ′(r, s) = 0 , i.e. χ′(r, s) = 1 for any (r, s) ∈R2. This makes the
projectiveunitaryrepresentationR ∋r →Wr actuallyunitary.SinceR ∋x →χ(x)
is continuous by construction and R ∋r →Vr is strongly continuous, also W = χV
is strongly continuous. That is to say, R ∋r →Wr is a strongly continuous one-
parameter unitary group satisfying (12.66), thus ending (a).
(b) Suppose there is another strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group U
representing γ :
U−rWrψ = χ(r)ψ ,
ψ ∈H.
(12.70)
(We have already proved χ(r) and ψ are independent in similar situations.) Conse-
quently Wr = χ(r)Ur. Multiply by Ws = χ(s)Us, and use the additivity of W and
U in the parameter:
Wr+s = χ(r)χ(s)Ur+s
so U−(r+s)Wr+s = χ(r)χ(s)I.
Comparing with U−(r+s)Wr+s = χ(r + s)I, produces
χ(r + s) = χ(r)χ(s) .
(12.71)
Equation (12.70) has another corollary:
(Urφ|Wrψ) = χ(r)(φ|ψ) .

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
By Stone’s theorem (Theorem 9.33) we can write Ut = eit B, Wt = eit A for self-
adjoint operators deﬁned on dense domains D(A), D(B). Choose φ ∈D(B), ψ ∈
D(A) so that (φ|ψ) ̸= 0 (always possible by density). By Stone the ﬁrst derivative
of R ∋t →χ(r) has to satisfy
d
dt (Urφ|Wrψ) =
 d

hence it exists and equals
(i BUrφ|Wrψ) + (Urφ|i AWrψ) .
Since the derivative of χ exists, and (12.71) holds:
d
dx χ(x) = lim
h→0
1
h (χ(x + h) −χ(x)) = χ(x) lim
h→0

h (χ(h) −χ(0)) = −χ(x)c .
Hence χ(x) = e−icx for some c ∈R and then
Wx = e−icxUx .
Converselylet W beasin(a)andﬁxc ∈R.AdirectcomputationshowsUx := eicxWx
is a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group that represents γ .
(c) The strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group R ∋r →Wr, built in
(a), represents γ and has a self-adjoint generator A, by Stone’s theorem. Therefore
Wr = eir A. If B : D(B) →H is another self-adjoint operator representing γ , its one-
parameter group Ut = eit B fulﬁls (b). Then there is c ∈R such that eitA = eitceitB.
By Stone’s theorem the left-hand side admits strong derivative at t = 0 on D(A),
and the derivative is i A. Similarly, the right-hand side admits strong derivative at
t = 0, at least on D(B), which equals icI + i B. Consequently D(A) ⊂D(B)
and A = (cI + B)↾D(A). Note cI + B is self-adjoint on D(B). Since A is self-
adjoint it does not have proper self-adjoint extensions, and then D(A) = D(B) and
A = B + cI.
⊓⊔
Example 12.46
(1) Consider Example 12.19(1). The physical system is a quantum particle with no
spin, described on the Hilbert space L2(R3, dx) if we ﬁx an inertial frame system
and identify R3 with the rest space via orthonormal Cartesian coordinates.
The subgroup ISO(3) of isometries of R3 consists of functions:
(t, R) : R3 ∋x →t + Rx ,
(12.72)
with t ∈R3, R ∈SO(3). Taking R ∈SO(3), as opposed to R ∈O(3) explains the
‘S’ in ISO(3). As said in Example 12.38(3) (about I O(n) there, but the argument is
the same), ISO(3) is a matrix group. Consider 4 × 4 real matrices:

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
719
g(t,R) :=
 1 0t
t R

,
t ∈Rn, R ∈SO(3).
(12.73)
The topology is inherited from GL(4, R) i.e. R16. The matrices g(t,R) correspond
one-to-one to elements of ISO(3), and ISO(3) ∋(t, R) →g(t,R) is an isomorphism,
beside a linear representation of ISO(3). In order to make the action of ISO(3) explicit
on points in R3, let us write points as column vectors (1, x1, x2, x3)t of R4, where
x1, x2, x3 are the Cartesian coordinates of x ∈R3. In this way we recover the action
of g(t,R) on R3 described by (12.72). We can indifferently see ISO(3) as the group of
maps (12.72) or the matrix group (12.73). In either case it will be a topological group
from now on. Similarly we may imagine IO(3) as a matrix group, simply allowing R
to vary in the whole O(3). With the given topologies, the construction makes ISO(3)
a topological subgroup of IO(3) and its connected component at the identity (0, I).
The linear unitary ISO(3)-representation on L2(R3, dx) seen in Example
12.19(1):
(UΓ ψ) (x) := ψ(Γ −1x) ,
Γ ∈ISO(3), ψ ∈L2(R3, dx)
is strongly continuous, since
||UΓ ψ −UΓ0ψ|| = ||UΓ −1
0
◦Γ ψ −ψ|| →0 as Γ →Γ0.
(12.74)
Now look at UΓ acting on pure states of H = L2(R3, dx):
γΓ (ψ(ψ| )) := UΓ ψ (ψ| ) U −1
Γ
.
The strongly continuous unitary representation ISO(3) ∋Γ →UΓ renders ISO(3)
a topological group of symmetries for the spinless quantum particle.
(2) Let Pi be the self-adjoint operator of the momentum observable along the axis
xi, and P the column vector (P1, P2, P3)t. With an eye on the previous example, let
us focus on the subgroup of translations along an axis t ∈R3. Such subgroup is the
strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group R ∋r →U (t)
r , with

U (t)
r ψ
	
(x) := ψ(x −rt) ,
t ∈R, ψ ∈L2(R3, dx) .
It is easy to prove the symmetric operator t · P↾S (R3) is essentially self-adjoint, so
(cf. Lemma 11.40)

e−i r

ψ ∈L2(R3, dx).
(12.75)
Therefore
the self-adjoint operator, which exists by Theorem 12.45(c), generating the strongly
continuous one-parameter unitary group of translations along t is the momentum

Observe that the generator can be modiﬁed by adding constants.

12.2.8
Round-Up on Lie Groups and Algebras
In this last section we assume the reader is familiar with differentiable manifolds,
including real-analytic ones (the basic notions are summarised in the appendix with
some detail). We recall fundamental results in the theory of Lie groups and provide
a few examples, all without proofs [Kir76, NaSt82, Var84].
Deﬁnition 12.47 (Lie group). A real Lie group of dimension n is a real-analytic
n-manifold G equipped with two analytic maps:
G ∋g →g−1 ∈G and G × G ∋(g, h) →g · h ∈G
(where G × G has the analytic product structure), that make G a group with neutral
element e.
The dimension of the Lie group G is the dimension n the manifold G.
Deﬁnition 12.48 (Lie group morphism). Consider Lie groups G, G′, with respective
neutral elements e, e′ and operations ·, ◦.
A Lie group homomorphism is an analytic map f : G →G′ that is also a group
homomorphism.
If the homomorphism f : G →G′ is invertible and f −1 is a homomorphism, f
is called Lie group isomorphism, and G, G′ are isomorphic (under f ).
A local homomorphism of Lie groups is an analytic map h : Oe →G′, where
Oe ⊂G is an open neighbourhood of e and h(g1 · g2) = h(g1) ◦h(g2) provided
g1 · g2 ∈Oe. (This forces h(e) = e′8 and h(g−1) = h(g)−1 for g, g−1 ∈Oe.)
If the local homomorphism h is an analytic diffeomorphism on its range (given
by an open neighbourhood Oe′ of e′), and the inverse f −1 : Oe′ →G is a local
homomorphism, then h is a local isomorphism of Lie groups. The Lie groups G,
G′ are locally isomorphic (under h).
Remark 12.49 Analyticity in Deﬁnition 12.47 can be watered down to having G just
a topological manifold with continuous operations in the manifold topology (i.e. a
topological group that is Hausdorff, paracompact, and locally homeomorphic to Rn).
In fact, a famous theorem proved in 1952 by Gleason, Montgomery and Zippin –
solving part of Hilbert’s ﬁfth problem – proves the following.
Theorem 12.50 (Gleason, Montgomery, Zippin) Every topological group with the
structure of a C0 manifold is isomorphic (as a topological group) to a Lie group,
and the real-analytic structure is unique up to Lie group isomorphisms.
8In fact h(e) = h(e · e) = h(e) ◦h(e), so applying h(e)−1 we get e′ = h(e).

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
721
Notice that the theorem implies that the initial (maximal) C0 atlas A0 of the topolog-
ical group whose operations are continuous contains at least one sub-atlas consisting
of a (maximal) real-analytic atlas Aω rendering the group operations analytic, and
producing a Lie group structure. Any other analytic structure on the initial topolog-
ical group compatible with the group operations must be analytically isomorphic to
Aω and produces an isomorphic Lie group structure.
■
In the same spirit of the previous remark we may weaken the assumptions of
differentiability when deﬁning local (and global) homomorphisms [NaSt82].
Proposition 12.51 Let G, G′ be Lie groups, Oe ⊂G an open neighbourhood of the
identity e ∈G.
If h : Oe →G′ is continuous and h(g1·g2) = h(g1)◦h(g2) provided g1·g2 ∈Oe,
then h is analytic on its domain and hence a local homomorphism of Lie groups.
In particular, a continuous group homomorphism between Lie groups is a Lie
group homomorphism.
Remark 12.52 A Lie group can be deﬁned by requiring that the group operations are
C∞, rather than analytic, with respect to some smooth differentiable structure. This
approach [War75, HiNe13] preserves all aforementioned results as well as all the
results we will state in the rest of the section, simply by replacing the word analytic
with smooth everywhere. Further, an analytic Lie group structure is contained in a
unique (maximal) C∞Lie group structure. Conversely a C∞Lie group structure
deﬁnes an analytic Lie group by direct application of the GMZ theorem. The larger
C∞structure associated to that analytic Lie group is isomorphic to the initial C∞
Lie group. This is due to Proposition 12.51 stated for C∞groups and where h is the
global identity map.
■
Two important concepts for our purposes are one-parameter subgroups and Lie
algebras, which we now recall.
Let G be a Lie group with neutral element e and product ·. The tangent space
at a point g ∈G is denoted TgG. Every g ∈G deﬁnes an (analytic) map Lg :
G ∋h →g · h, and let us write dLg : ThG →Tg·hG for its differential. Given
A ∈TeG, we consider the ﬁrst-order Cauchy problem on G: ﬁnd a differentiable
map f : (−α, β) →G, α, β > 0 such that
d f
dt = dL f (t)A with f (0) = e.
The maximal solution is always complete, i.e. with largest-possible domain
(−α, β) = R. We will indicate the maximal solution by
R ∋t →exp(t A)
and we will call it the one-parameter subgroup generated by A. If T ∈TeG it can
be proved that
exp(tT ) exp(t′T ) = exp((t + t′)T ) ,
(exp(tT ))−1 = exp(−tT ) , ∀t, t′ ∈R.

722
12
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
Consider now a given T ∈TeG and the collection of maps:
Ft,T : G ∋g →exp(tT ) g exp(−tT)
parametrised by t ∈R. As Ft,T (e) = e, the differential dFt,T |e maps TeG to itself,
and is called the adjoint of Ft,T
Ad Ft,T : TeG →TeG .
The commutator [War75] is the map TeG × TeG →TeG:
[T, Z] := d
dt |t=0(Ad Ft,T ) Z ,
T, Z ∈TeG .
The commutator has three properties:
linearity:
[aA + bB, C] = a[A, C] + b[B, C] ,
skew-symmetry:
[A, B] = −[B, A] ,
Jacobiidentity:
[A, [B, C]] + [B, [C, A]] + [C, [A, B]] = 0
holding for any a, b ∈R and A, B, C ∈TeG. The ﬁrst two actually imply bilinearity.
The third property is a consequence of the associativity of the group law.
Let us ﬁx a local coordinate system x1, . . . , xn compatible with the (analytic)
structure of G over an open neighbourhood U of e, so that the neutral element
becomes the origin. In these coordinates we can expand the group law on U × U in
Taylor series up to the second order
ψ(X, X′) = X + X′ + B(X, X′) + O

|X|2 + |X′2|
	3/2
,
(12.76)
where X, X′ ∈Rn are the column vectors of the coordinates of elements g, g′ ∈U
whose product g · g′ belongs to U. The mapping B : Rn × Rn →Rn is bilinear, and
it is easy to see that the commutator, in the coordinate basis of TeG, becomes:
[T, T ′] = B(T, T ′) −B(T ′, T ) ,
(12.77)
where T , T ′ are (column) vectors in TeG.
Deﬁnition 12.53 (Lie algebra). A vector space V (with ﬁeld K = R or C) endowed
with a bilinear, skew-symmetric map { , } : V × V →V that satisﬁes the Jacobi
identity is called a Lie algebra, and { , } is the Lie bracket.
Given Lie algebras (V, { , }), (V′, { , }′), a linear mapping φ : V →V′ is a Lie
algebra homomorphism if {φ(A), φ(B)}′ = φ({A, B}) for any A, B ∈V. If φ is
also bijective one calls it a Lie algebra isomorphism.

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
723
If V′ is a K-linear space of linear operators on a given vector space X and { , }′
is the standard commutator of operators on X, the Lie algebra homomorphism φ is
called representation of the Lie algebra (V, { , }) on X.
Given a Lie group G, the tangent space TeG with the Lie bracket [ , ] given by
the commutator is the Lie algebra of the Lie group G.
A Lie subalgebra V′ in a Lie algebra (V, [ , ]) is a closed subspace under the Lie
bracket, [A, B] ∈V′ for A, B ∈V′. An ideal J in a Lie algebra (V, [ , ]) is a Lie
subalgebra such that
[A, B] ∈J
for any A ∈J, B ∈V.
A Lie algebra V is said to be simple if it is not Abelian and it contains no non-trivial
proper (i.e. different from {0} and V itself) ideals, and semisimple if it is a direct
sum of simple Lie algebras.
A Lie group whose Lie algebra is semisimple is called a semisimple Lie group.
A crucial feature of Lie groups for physics is that the Lie algebra of a Lie group
determines the group almost entirely, as the classical, and famous, next results shows
[NaSt82]. First, though, a topological reminder.
Deﬁnition 12.54 (Covering space). Let X be a topological space. Another topo-
logical space R is a covering space of X if there exists a continuous, onto map
π : R →X, called covering map, as follows:
(i) for any x ∈X there exists an open set U ∋x such that π−1(U) = ∪j∈J A j, with
A j ⊂R open, A j ∩Ai = ∅if i ̸= j, i, j ∈J,
(ii) π↾A j: A j →U is a homeomorphism for every j ∈J.
A covering R of X is a universal covering if it is simply connected (Deﬁnition
1.28).
Two universal coverings R, R′ of X are homeomorphic under a map f : R →R′
such that Π = f ◦Π′, where Π : R →X, Π′ : R′ →X are the covering maps.
Similarly, if X has a universal covering R and a covering R′, with covering maps
Π : R →X, π : R′ →X, then there is a covering map p : R →R′ with π ◦p = Π
[Ser94II].
The ﬁrst result, customarily called Lie’s third theorem in the literature, is stated
below [NaSt82]. A discrete subgroup of a topological group G is a subgroup G′
such that, for every element of G′ there is an open set in G containing only that
element of the subgroup. In other words G′ is discrete iff every singlet {g} ⊂G′ is
open in the induced topology.
Theorem 12.55 (Lie’s third theorem) Let V be a ﬁnite-dimensional (real) Lie alge-
bra.
(a) There exists a connected and simply connected (real) Lie group GV with Lie
algebra V.
(b) GV is, up to isomorphisms, the universal covering of any Lie group G having V
as Lie algebra, and the covering map π : GV →G is a Lie group homomorphism.

724
12
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
(c) If a connected Lie group G has V as Lie algebra, it is isomorphic to a quotient
GV/HG, where HG ⊂GV is a discrete normal subgroup, contained in the centre of
GV,9 that coincides with the kernel of π.
Another important result the following one.
Theorem 12.56 (Lie, Pontrjagin) Let G, G′ be (real) Lie groups with Lie algebras
V, V′.
(a) f : V →V′ is a Lie algebra homomorphism if and only if there is a local Lie
group homomorphism h : G →G′ such that dh|e = f , where e is the neutral
element of G. Moreover:
(i) h is determined completely by f ,
(ii) f is an isomorphism ⇔h is a local Lie group isomorphism.
(b) If h : G →G′ is a Lie group homomorphism then:
(i) dh|e : V →V′ is surjective ⇔the connected component of G containing e
is surjectively mapped onto the connected component of G′ containing the neutral
element of G′.
(ii) dh|e : V →V′ is injective ⇔the kernel of h is a discrete subgroup of G.
(c) If G, G′ are connected and G also simply connected, then f : V →V′ is a
homomorphism if and only if there is a homomorphism h : G →G′ such that
dh|e = f . Moreover:
(i) h is determined completely by f ,
(ii) f isomorphism ⇒h onto,
(iii) f isomorphism and G′ simply connected ⇒h isomorphism.
Deﬁnition 12.57 (Lie subgroup – simple Lie group). An embedded (analytic) sub-
manifold G′ ⊂G in a Lie group that is also a subgroup inherits a Lie group structure
from G. In such case G′ is a Lie subgroup of G.
The Lie subgroup G′ is said to be discrete when the set {e} (e being the neutral
element of both) is open in the induced topology on G′.
A Lie group G is said to be simple if it does not admit non-trivial proper (i.e.
different from {e} and G) connected Lie subgroups G′ that are normal ({g·h·g−1|h ∈
G′} ⊂G′ for every g ∈G).
Remark 12.58
(1) The deﬁnition of discrete Lie subgroup we gave is equivalent to the aforemen-
tioned standard deﬁnition, valid for topological groups (G′ is discrete iff every singlet
{g} ⊂G′ isopenintheinducedtopology)becausethetranslationG′ →G′ : h →gh
is a homeomorphism. Evidently a discrete Lie group is a 0-dimensional submanifold,
made of a ﬁnite or countable set of points, and its Lie algebra is the trivial vector
space.
(2) A connected Lie group is simple iff its Lie algebra is simple.
(3) According to Sect.A.2, a simple Lie group may be not simple as an abstract
group. In particular, a simple Lie group (e.g., SL(2, C)) can contain a non-trivial
discrete normal subgroup.

9It is also possible to prove that HG is isomorphic to the fundamental group (the ﬁrst homotopy
group) of G which, for Lie groups, is known to be Abelian.

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
725
We have a pair of relevant results [NaSt82].
Theorem 12.59 (Cartan) If G′ ⊂G is a closed subgroup of the Lie group G, then
G′ is a Lie subgroup of G (including the case of a discrete Lie group).
It is possible to prove the converse fact (see, e.g., [Lee06, Proposition 8.30]).
Proposition 12.60 An embedded submanifold of a Lie group which is a Lie group
with respect to the induced structure is necessarily closed.
Summing up, closure completely characterises Lie subgroups.
Theorem 12.61 Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra V .
(a) The Lie algebra of a Lie subgroup G′ is a Lie subalgebra of V .
(b) If L ⊂TeG is a Lie subalgebra of V , there exists a unique connected Lie subgroup
G′ ⊂G whose Lie algebra is L.
Remarks 12.62 (1) In principle an abstract Lie algebra can have inﬁnite dimension
as vector space. The dimension of the Lie algebra of a Lie group G, instead, is always
ﬁnite for it coincides with the dimension of the manifold G.
(2) Theorem 12.59 clearly subsumes discrete subgroups as special cases. Then the
manifold underlying the Lie subgroup has dimension zero.
(3) Let G be a Lie group of dimension n and {T1, . . . Tn} a basis of the Lie algebra
TeG. As the Lie bracket is bilinear it can be written in components
[Ti, Tj] =
dim TeG

k=1
Ci jkTk .
The coefﬁcients Ci jk are the structure constants of the Lie group.10 The Jacobi
identity is equivalent to the following equation (of obvious proof):
n

s=1

Ci jsCskr + C jksCsir + CkisCsjr
	
= 0 ,
r = 1, . . . , n.
(12.78)
If two Lie groups have the same structure constants with respect to some bases
of their Lie algebras, they are locally isomorphic in the sense of Theorems 12.55,
12.56. (If the structure constants are equal, the linear map identifying bases is an
isomorphism.) Conversely, the structure constants of locally isomorphic Lie groups
are the same in two bases related by the pullback of the local isomorphism.
■
Given a Lie group G, the exponential mapping is the analytic function
exp : TeG ∋T →exp(tT )|t=1 .
(12.79)
10The structure constants, sometimes denoted by Ck
i j, are the components of a tensor, called the
structure tensor of the Lie group.

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
The exponential mapping has an important property, sanctioned by the next result
[NaSt82].
Theorem 12.63 Let G be a Lie group with neutral element e and exponential map
exp.
(a) There exist open neighbourhoods U of 0 ∈TeG and V of e ∈G such that
exp↾U: U →V
is an analytic diffeomorphism (bijective, analytic, with analytic inverse).
(b) If G is compact then exp(TeG) = G.
(c) If G′ is a Lie group with exponential map exp′ and h : G →G′ a Lie group
homomorphism:
h ◦exp = exp′ ◦dh|e .
Property (a) has a useful corollary. Fix a basis T1, . . . , Tn on the Lie algebra of G,
Then the inverse to
F : (x1, . . . , xn) →exp
 n

k=1
xnTn

deﬁnes a local chart, compatible with the analytic structure, around the neutral ele-
ment. This is called a normal coordinate system or system of coordinates of ﬁrst
type. Normal coordinates, in general, do not cover G. In normal coordinates a vector
T ∈TeG ≡Rn determines a point of G only around e. Hence the group multipli-
cation in G becomes a map ψ : Rn × Rn →Rn. Expanding the latter with Taylor
around the origin of Rn × Rn gives
ψ(T, T ′) = T + T ′ + 1
2[T, T ′] + O

(12.80)
where [T, T ′] : Rn × Rn →Rn is the commutator in the basis of TeG × TeG
associated to normal coordinates. The proof is left to the reader. Property (a) has also
another consequence (whose proof is an exercise).
Proposition 12.64 Let G be a Lie group with neutral element e and product ·.
(a) There exists an open set A ∋e in TeG such that any g ∈A can be written as
g = exp(tT ) for some t ∈R and some T ∈TeG.
(b) If G is connected and g /∈A, there are ﬁnitely many elements g1, g2, . . . , gn ∈A
such that g = g1 · · · · · gn.
Another useful local chart around the neutral element, called system of coordinates
of second type is obtained as the inverse of
G : (x1, . . . , xn) →exp (x1T1) · · · exp (xnTn)
where · is the group multiplication and (x1, . . . , xn) varies in a sufﬁciently small
open neighbourhood of (0, . . . , 0) in Rn.

The fundamental Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula [NaSt82]:
exp(X) exp(Y) = exp(Z(X, Y))
(12.81)
holds on any connected and simply connected Lie group G, with X, Y in the open
neighbourhood U of the origin where exp is a local diffeomorphism onto the open
neighbourhood exp(U) ⊂G of the neutral element. In (12.81) the term Z(X, Y) is
deﬁned by the series:

Example 12.65
(1) M(n, R) will denote from now on the set of real n × n matrices, and M(n, C)
complex n × n matrices.
The group GL(n, R) of invertible real n × n matrices is a n2-dimensional Lie
group with analytic structure induced by Rn2. Its Lie algebra is the set of real n × n
matrices M(n, R) and the Lie bracket is the usual commutator [A, B] := AB −B A,
A, B ∈M(n, R).
An important feature of GL(n, R) is that its one-parameter subgroups have this
form:
R ∋t →et A :=
+∞

k=0
tk
k! Ak ,
for any A ∈M(n, R), and the convergence is meant in any of the equivalent norms
of the Banach space Rn2 (Sect.2.5).
(2) Any closed subgroup of GL(n, R) we have met as topological group, like O(n),
SO(n), I O(n), I SO(n), SL(n, R), the Galilean, Lorentz and Poincaré groups, are
therefore Lie groups. As GL(n, C) can be seen as a subgroup in GL(2n, R) (decom-
posing every matrix element in real and imaginary part), complex matrix groups like
U(n) and SU(n), too, are real Lie groups. We must emphasise that working with
matrix Lie groups is not a major restriction, since every compact Lie group is isomor-
phic to a matrix group [War75]. For non-compact Lie groups the story is completely
different, a counterexample being the universal covering of SL(2, R).
(3) The exponential of matrices A, B ∈M(n, C) has interesting characteristics.
First, eA+B = eAeB = eBeA if AB = B A. The proof is similar to the case of
numbers, for which one uses Taylor’s expansion. There is, though, another useful
fact: A ∈M(n, C) satisﬁes, for any t ∈C,

728

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
det et A = ettr A ,
in particular det eA = etr A .
Let us prove this identity. We want to differentiate C ∋t →det et A , i.e. ﬁnd
lim
h→0
det e(t+h)A −det et A
h
= lim
h→0
det (et Aeh A) −det et A
h
= det et A lim
h→0
det eh A −1
h
as long as the last limit exists. Since eh A = I + h A + ho(h) , with o(h) →0 as
h →0 in the standard topology of Cn2, it follows
lim
h→0
det e(t+h)A −det et A
h
= det et A lim
h→0
det (I + h A + ho(h)) −1
h
.
There are many ways to see that det(I + h A + ho(h)) = 1 + h n
i=1 Aii + ho(h),
and substituting above we ﬁnd
d det et A
dt
= det et AtrA .
That also proves the function is smooth. Hence f A : C ∋t →det et A solves the
differential equation:
d f A(t)
dt
= (tr A) f A(t) .
Also gA : C ∋t →ettr A solves the equation. And both functions satisfy the initial
condition f A(0) = gA(0) = 1, by uniqueness of maximal solutions of ﬁrst-order
equations we obtain det et A = ettr A, any t ∈R.
(4) The group of rotations O(n) := {R ∈M(n, R) | RRt = I} of Rn is an important
Lie group in physics. That it is a subgroup of GL(n, R) is evident because {R ∈
M(n, R) | RRt = I} is closed in the Euclidean topology. (Clearly O(n) contains
its limit points: Ak ∈O(n) and Ak →A ∈Rn2 as k →∞imply At
k →At and
I = Ak At
k →AAt.) The Lie algebra of O(n), denoted o(n), is the vector space of
real, skew-symmetric n × n matrices, and has dimension n(n −1)/2 = dim O(n).
The proof is that Lie algebra vectors are tangent vectors ˙R(0) at the identity of the
group (the identity matrix) to curves R = R(u) such that R(u)R(u)t = I, R(0) = I.
By deﬁnition, then, they satisfy ˙R(0)R(0)t + R(0) ˙R(0)t = 0, i.e. ˙R(0)+ ˙R(0)t = 0.
But this deﬁnes real skew-symmetric n×n matrices, a space of dimension n(n−1)/2.
On the other hand, if A is a real skew-symmetric n×n matrix, R(t) = et A ∈O(n) as
follows from the elementary properties of the exponential function, and ˙R(0) = A.
We conclude that the Lie algebra of O(n) is nothing but the whole collection of real
skew-symmetric n × n matrices.
Eventually note that O(n) is compact since closed and bounded, as we saw earlier.
Boundedness is explained in analogy to U(n):

The three-dimensional Lie group O(3) has two connected components: the compact
(connected) group SO(3) := {R ∈O(3) | det R = 1} and the compact set (not a
subgroup) PSO(3) := {P R ∈O(3) | R ∈SO(3)}, where P := −I is the parity
transformation.
(5) We will explain how the exponential map is a covering map for the whole group
SO(3). Deﬁne a special basis of so(3) given by matrices (Ti) jk = −εi jk where
εi jk = 1 if i, j, k is a cyclic permutation of 1, 2, 3, εi jk = −1 if i, j, k is a non-cyclic
permutation, εi jk = 0 otherwise. More explicitly

All are skew-symmetric so they belong in so(3), and they are clearly linearly inde-
pendent, hence a basis of so(3). Structure constants are simple in this basis:
[Ti, Tj] =

k=1

(12.85)
The exponential representation of SO(3) is as follows: R ∈SO(3) if and only if
there exist a unit vector n ∈R3 and a number θ ∈R such that
R = eθn·T ,
where n · T :=
3

i=1
niTi .
(6) The Lie algebra of the compact group SU(2), seen as a real Lie group, is the
real vector space of traceless skew-Hermitian matrices (because the determinant in
the group equals 1). Consequently it has a basis formed by −i
2σ j, j = 1, 2, 3,
where σk are the Pauli matrices of (12.13). The factor 1/2 is present so to satisfy the

By the remark ensuing Theorem 12.59 the Lie algebras of SU(2) and SO(3) are
isomorphic. Hence by Theorems 12.55, 12.56 the Lie groups are locally isomorphic.
As SU(2) is connected and simply connected (it is homeomorphic to the boundary
S3 of the unit ball in R4), whereas SO(3) is not simply connected, SU(2) must be
the universal covering of SO(3). The Lie algebra isomorphism should arise from

differentiating a surjective homomorphism SU(2) →SO(3). The latter is actually
well known (Exercise 12.18), so let us recall it brieﬂy. The exponential map of SU(2)
covers the entire group by compactness. In practice every matrix U ∈SU(2) can be
written
U = e−iθn· σ

where θ ∈R and n is a unit vector in R3. The aforementioned surjective morphism
is the onto map

12.2.9
Continuous Unitary Finite-Dimensional
Representations of Connected Non-compact Lie
Groups
We discuss here a technical result that is mentioned very often, and used to prove that
there are no non-trivial unitary continuous ﬁnite-dimensional representations of the
special orthochronous Lorentz group SO(1, 3)↑. The result extends to its universal
covering SL(2, C), as we shall explain after the proof. Unfortunately the proof of
many books, and often the statement itself, of this remarkable proposition contains
mistakes.
Observe that the theorem does not refer to strong or weak continuity, just because,
inann-dimensionalHilbertspace,thesenotionsofcontinuityareevidentlyequivalent
to the continuity in the standard Cn.
Theorem 12.66 Let G be a connected non-compact Lie group and
U : G ∋g →Ug ∈B(H)
a continuous unitary representation on a ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space H. Then
(a) U cannot be faithful;
(b) If G is a simple group or, more generally, if it does not contain non-trivial proper
normal closed subgroups, then U is the trivial representation U : G ∋g →I.
Proof Let us identify H with Cn by means of an orthonormal basis. In this way, the
representation U can be viewed as an injective continuous group homomorphism
f : G →U(n).
(a) Our ﬁnal goals is proving that f (G) is a compact embedded submanifold of
U(n) and that the injective homomorphism f : G →f (G) is actually a homeomor-
phism. This will not be possible, because G is not compact by hypothesis.

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
731
Due to Theorem 12.56, f is differentiable (analytic) and d f |e is a Lie algebra
homomorphism which is injective if f is faithful (because the kernel of f is the
discrete subgroup {e}). Assuming that f is injective (i.e., U is faithful), consider
the Lie subalgebra u0 := d f |eTeG ⊂u(n) where u(n) is the Lie algebra of U(n).
Since d f |e is injective, u0 is isomorphic to TeG. There is exactly one connected Lie
subgroupU0 ⊂U(n)whoseLiealgebraisu0 inviewofTheorem12.61.Bydeﬁnition
of Lie subgroup, U0 is an embedded submanifold of U(n). It must be clear that
f (G)∩U0 contains all one-parameter subgroups of U(n) generated by the elements
of u0, because these subgroups are simultaneously in U0 and in f (G), as the reader
can prove immediately using Theorem 12.63(c). On the other hand, every element
h ∈U0 is a ﬁnite product of elements belonging to the one-parameter subgroups of
U0 as a consequence of Proposition 12.64, and hence h is also a ﬁnite product of
elements of f (G). Since f is a group homomorphism, every element h ∈U0 satisﬁes
h ∈f (G). We have so far established that U0 = f (G). The map f : G →U0 is
a bijective differentiable map from the manifold G to the embedded submanifold
U0 of U(n). Since d f |g = dLg−1 ◦d f |e ◦d Rg where Rg : G ∋h →hg ∈G and
Lk : U(n) ∋r →kr ∈U(n) are diffeomorphisms and therefore both dLg−1 and d Rg
are a bijections, we conclude that d f |g is everywhere injective. As a consequence
[Wes78, Proposition 4.2(2)], if p = dim G and q = dim U(n) ≥p, then for any
chart (Sg, φ) around any g ∈G there is some chart (Vg, ψ) in U(n) around f (g)
with
ψ ◦f ◦φ−1(x1, . . . , x p) = (x1, . . . , x p, 0, . . . , 0)
where (x1, . . . , x p) belongs to the open set φ(Vg) ⊂Rq. Since f (G) = U0 is an
embeddedsubmanifoldofU(n),wehavethat Vg∩f (G) = f (Sg)possiblyrestricting
Vg around f (g). In other words f (Sg) is open in the induced topology of f (G) ⊂
U(n). Since g ∈G is arbitrary and the property is valid by replacing Sg with any
smaller open set containing g, the injectivity of f proves that f : G →U0 = f (G)
is open: every open set A ⊂G is the union of open sets A = ∪g∈GA ∩Sg; since
f is bijective onto U0 we also have that f (A) = ∪g∈G f (A ∩Sg), which is open
because union of open sets. The inverse f −1 : U0 →G exists (because f is bijective
onto U0), and is therefore continuous. By Proposition 12.60 U0 is closed and hence
compact (U(n) is compact). This is absurd, because f −1(U0) = G is not compact
by hypothesis and f −1 is continuous. We conclude that f : G →U(n) cannot be
injective, that is, U : G →B(H) cannot be faithful.
(b) If G does not contain non-trivial proper closed normal subgroups, the normal
closed subgroup U −1(I) of G must equal either G or {e}. In the second case U
would be faithful, which is not permitted by (a). Summing up, U −1(I) = G so that
U(G) = {I}.
⊓⊔
Remarks 12.67 (1) The theorem applies to SO(1, 3)↑since this is non-compact,
connected and it has no non-trivial closed normal subgroups: its strongly continuous
unitary representations are inﬁnite-dimensional or trivial. The same result is valid

732
12
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
for SL(2, C), which is non-compact and connected but not simple11: SL(2, C) does
not admit non-trivial proper ﬁnite-dimensional continuous unitary representations.
Indeed, {±I} is the unique non-trivial proper normal closed subgroup of SL(2, C). A
ﬁnite-dimensional continuous unitary representation U : SL(2, C) →B(H) cannot
be faithful by (a). Therefore the closed normal subgroup U −1(I) cannot be trivial
and therefore coincides with either SL(2, C), making U trivial, or with {±I}. Let
us examine this second possibility, and prove that U has to be trivial also in this
case. As is well known, the Lie group SL(2, C) is the universal covering of the Lie
group SO(1, 3)↑in accordance with Theorem 12.55, and {±I} is just the kernel of
the covering homomorphism, so SO(1, 3)↑is diffeomorphic to SL(2, C)/{±I}. It is
easy to prove that, consequently,U : SL(2, C) →B(H) deﬁnes a ﬁnite-dimensional
continuous unitary representation
U ′ : SO(1, 3)↑∋±A →UA ∈B(H) .
The representation U ′ must be trivial by (b). In turn, U must be trivial as well because
U ′(SO(1, 3)↑) = U(SL(2, C)).
(2) Since O(n) is compact, like U(n), the same argument exploited for the theorem
above can be used to prove that a connected non-compact Lie group cannot admit
faithful continuous representations on orthogonal matrices and, in particular, all these
representations are trivial if the hypotheses in (b) are true.

12.2.10
Bargmann’s Theorem
We proceed in the study of symmetry groups and deal with connected Lie groups G.
Any projective G-representation is representable by unitary operators.
Proposition 12.68 Let G be a connected Lie group. For any projective represen-
tation G ∋g →γg on a Hilbert space H of dim H > 1, the images γg can be
associated to unitary operators only, according to Wigner’s theorem (or Kadison’s).
If dim H = 1 a unitary representation is always possible.
Proof If dim H > 1, by Proposition 12.64, every g ∈G is the product of a
ﬁnite number of elements h = exp(tT ). Then h = r · r with r = exp(tT/2).
Using Proposition 12.32 the claim follows. If dim H = 1 every γg is the iden-
tity and therefore it can be represented unitarily by the trivial representation
G ∋g →I.
⊓⊔
At this point we shall present a number of general results on strongly continuous
unitary representations of Lie groups.
It will be useful, in the sequel, to observe that any projective representation of a
topological group G may be seen as projective representation of its universal covering
11Though it is a simple Lie group because it has no non-trivial proper connected normal Lie sub-
groups.

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups

group G. In fact if π : G →G is the covering map (a continuous homomorphism of
topological groups [NaSt82], also guaranteed by Theorem 12.55 for Lie groups), and
γ : G ∋g →γg is a continuous projective G-representation on the Hilbert space
H, then γ ◦π : G ∋h →γπ(h) is a continuous projective G-representation; note
that it does not distinguish elements h, h′ ∈G if π(h) = π(h′). Put equivalently,
if h · h′−1 ∈Ker(π) then γ ◦π(h) = γ ◦π(h′) i.e. (γ ◦π)(Ker(π)) = id, or
Ker(π) ⊂Ker(γ ◦π). This proves the following.
Proposition 12.69 Let G be a topological group and π : G →G its universal
covering. Every continuous projective representation γ : G ∋g →γg of G on the
Hilbert space H arises from the continuous projective representation γ ′ : G ∋g →
γ ′
g of G ≡G/Ker(π) on H such that Ker(π) ⊂Ker(γ ′).
Remark 12.70 When needed, henceforth, we will use projective unitary representa-
tions of G instead of G, because the latter are determined by the former and, in case
of Lie groups, G is determined by its Lie algebra.
■
We will prepare the ground for an important theorem due to Bargmann [Bar54], that
provides sufﬁcient conditions for a continuous projective representation to be given
by a unitary representation when the groups in questions are Lie groups. An exhaus-
tive discussion on the mathematical technology necessary to prove the theorem of
Bargmann appears in [Var07, Chap.VII] together with several physical examples.
The preliminary idea, presented in Sect.12.2.5, is that a projective unitary represen-
tation
G ∋g →Ug
of a group G is the restriction Ug := U(1,g) of a unitary representation
Gω ∋(χ, g) →U(χ,g) = χUg
of a suitable central extension Gω of G. This is always possible by virtue of Proposi-
tion 12.36. Assume G is a topological group, and the projective unitary representation
G ∋g →Ug induces a continuous projective representation. We can choose the
phases of the Ug so that the representation G ∋g →Ug is continuous around
the identity of G by Proposition 12.44. This cannot be extended to the entire G, in
general. The next technical result extends the result to when G is a Lie group.
Theorem 12.71 Let G be a connected Lie group and γ : G ∋g →γg a continuous
projective representation on the Hilbert space H. There exist a central extension Gω
and a unitary representation
Gω ∋(χ, g) →U(χ,g) ∈B(H)

with12 ω(e, e) = ω(g, e) = ω(e, g) = 1 and U(χ,e) = χ I for any χ ∈U(1), such
that:
(a) Gω is a connected Lie group, the canonical injection U(1) →Gω and canon-
ical projection Gω →G are Lie group homomorphisms;
(b) as topological space Gω is the product U(1) × Ag around every element
(χ, g), where Ag ⊂G is an open neighbourhood of g ∈G (but Gω is not U(1) × G
globally in general);
(c) as C∞manifold Gω is the product U(1) × A around the unit element (1, e),
where A ⊂G is an open neighbourhood of e ∈G;
(d) the map G ∋g →U(1,g) =: Ug is a projective unitary representation that
induces γ :
γg(ρ) = UgρU −1
g
for any g ∈G, ρ ∈Sp(H)
(12.87)
and is strongly continuous on an open neighbourhood of the unit e ∈G;
(e) the unitary representation Gω ∋(χ, g) →U(χ,g) is strongly continuous.
Outline of the proof. Given γ , consider an initial projective unitary representation
G ∋g →Vg inducing γ with multiplier ω0 and the associated unitary representa-
tion of the corresponding central extension Gω0. Using Proposition 12.44, pass to a
different but equivalent projective unitary representation G ∋g →Ug such that in a
neighbourhood A of e ∈G the map A ∋g →Ug is strongly continuous. According
to Lemma 7.20 in [Var07], it is possible to replace the multiplier of that extension with
an equivalent multiplier that is C∞on a neighbourhood of e and that we shall indicate
by ω again. Notice that this change preserves the strong continuity of A ∋g →Ug.
Finally, deﬁne the unitary representation Gω ∋(χ, g) →U(χ,g) := χUg inducing
γ so that γ (ρ) = U(χ,g)ρU −1
(χ,g) = UgρU −1
g . According to [Kir76, Exercises 1 and
2, Sect.14.3], exploiting again the argument of the proof of Proposition 12.44, every
g ∈G admits a neighbourhood Ag and a corresponding local homeomorphisms
Gω →U(1) × G:
Gω ⊃U(1) × Ag ∋(χ, h) →(χ(g)
h χ, h) ∈U(1) × Ag ⊂U(1) × G ,
where the maps Ag ∋h →χ(g)
h
are such that Ag ∋h →χ(g)
h Uh is strongly
continuous. By construction χ(e)
g
= 1 for g ∈Ae =: A. This class of local home-
omorphisms deﬁnes a C0 atlas on Gω (made of charts with domain U(1) × Ag)
compatible with the group operations of Gω. Hence the Gleason–Montgomery–
Zippin theorem implies that the C0 structure of Gω contains an analytic Lie sub-
structure. (a) and (b) hold because the canonical maps U(1) →Gω and Gω →G
are topological group homomorphisms (the proof is immediate) and therefore they
are Lie group homomorphisms in view of Proposition 12.51. To prove (c) con-
sider the topological group structure of Gω on a neighbourhood U(1) × A of the

map.

unit element. The group operations of Gω constructed out of the smooth func-
tion ω are smooth with respect to the product of C∞structures of U(1) and
A. Applying Theorem 9.4.4 in [HiNe13] to U(1) × A, one sees that there is a
unique C∞Lie group structure on the topological group Gω such that the inclusion
U(1) × A →Gω is a C∞diffeomorphism onto its image. From Corollary 2.17
in [HiNe13], the said global C∞structure must coincide with the C∞Lie group
structure obtained by enlarging the analytic GMZ structure. In summary, the C∞
structure around the identity of Gω coincides with that of U(1) × G. To prove (d),
observe that A ∋g →Ug coincides with the unitary projective representation found
in Proposition 12.44, that is strongly continuous in A. Therefore A ∋g →Ug
is strongly continuous. Statement (e) is easy. Since (χ, g) →U(χ,g) = χUg is
a unitary representation, it is strongly continuous iff it is strongly continuous at
the unit element (1, e). The latter is true because g →Ug is continuous on a
neighbourhood A of e and Gω is homeomorphic to U(1) × A around (1, e), so
that (χ, g) →(1, e) in the topology of Gω means (χ, g) →(1, e) in the product
topology and ||U(χ,g)ψ −U(1,e)ψ|| = ||χUgψ −1Ueψ|| = ||χUgψ −ψ|| →0 if
(χ, g) →(1, e) in the product topology.
□
So let us assume, by the above theorem, that any continuous projective repre-
sentation of a Lie group G is obtainable as strongly continuous projective unitary
representation of a central extension of G, itself a Lie group. This allows to introduce
Bargmann’s theorem.
Let us go through the proof’s idea, heuristically. Take a Lie group G (connected
and simply connected in the theorem) and its central U(1)-extensions Gω. Projective
unitary representations of G are honest continuous unitary representations of U(1)-
extensions of G. The question is when are continuous unitary representations of Gω
reducible to continuous unitary representations of G. Since the C∞structure of Gω
is isomorphic to that of U(1) × G around the identity, this is enough to guarantee
that the Lie algebra of Gω is the vector space R ⊕TeG with bracket

r ⊕T,r′ ⊕T ′
= α(T, T ′) ⊕[T, T ′] ,
where r ⊕T is the generic element in R ⊕TeG and α : TeG × TeG →TeG a
bilinear skew-symmetric map. A common alternative way to write this is to ﬁx a
basis {Tk}k=1,...,n of TeG and set

The coefﬁcients αi j := α(Ti, Tj) are by construction skew-symmetric, and, in
consequence of Jacobi’s identity (and corresponding to (12.94) under Bargmann’s
Theorem) (12.90) holds:

The numbers αi j are often called central charges. The key idea behind Bargmann’s
theorem is to change basis in the Lie algebra of Gω, passing to the new generators
I ′ := I ,

(12.93)
(note Ci jk and αi j are given, once Gω is known) we can write the bracket relations

[T ′

These are the very commutation relations of the Lie algebra of the direct product
of U(1) and G, where ω(g, g′) = 1 always. If this is possible, we expect to view a
unitary Gω-representation as an honest unitary G-representation times U(1), getting
rid of the phases.
The hypothesis of Bargmann’s Theorem [Bar54], formulated by (12.95), is just
condition (12.93), as the proof will explain. The linear function β of the statement,
in fact, is completely determined by the coefﬁcients βk if we set β(Tk) := βk.
Theorem 12.72 (Bargmann) Let G be a connected, simply connected Lie group.
Every continuous projective G-representation on the Hilbert space H is induced by
a strongly continuous unitary representation on H provided the following condition
holds. For any skew-symmetric bilinear map α : TeG × TeG →R satisfying

(12.95)
Proof Consider a continuous projective representation γ : G ∋g →γg on the
Hilbert space H. By Theorem 12.71, there is a central U(1)-extension Gω of G with
the structure of Lie group, and a projective unitary representation U : G ∋g →Ug
that is strongly continuous around e ∈G and induces γ . The canonical inclusion and
projection are Lie homomorphisms. Moreover, around the origin the C∞structure
of Gω is the product U(1) × A for some neighbourhood A of e ∈G. The multiplier
function is normalised so that ω(e, e) = ω(e, g) = ω(g, e) = 1, hence the neutral
element of Gω is (1, e). The real vector space underlying the Lie algebra of Gω is
R ⊕TeG, where ⊕is the direct sum. We will denote by r ⊕T the elements, where
r ∈R and T ∈TeG. As already said, by the deﬁnition of Lie bracket [ , ] of TeG,
a few computations involving (12.77) say that the bracket [ , ]ω of T1⊕eGω has the
form:

r ⊕T,r′ ⊕T ′
ω = α(T, T ′) ⊕[T, T ′]
(12.96)
where α : TeG × TeG →R is a bilinear skew-symmetric map satisfying (12.94),
owing to the Jacobi identity of [ , ]ω. Now we show that, retaining the hypotheses
of the theorem, the universal covering of Gω is the Lie group R ⊗G, where ⊗is
the direct product (R is an additive Lie group). The topological space underlying
R ⊗G is the product R × G, simply connected as the factors are. By Theorem 12.55
R ⊗G is the unique simply connected Lie group, up to isomorphisms, having that
Lie algebra, and hence is the universal covering of all Lie groups with the Lie algebra
of R ⊗G. We will show Gω is one of those. The Lie algebra of R ⊗G is R ⊕TeG
with bracket:

r ⊕T,r′ ⊕T ′
⊗= 0 ⊕[T, T ′]
(12.97)
To prove the claim it sufﬁces to exhibit an isomorphism mapping the Lie algebra of
R ⊗G to the Lie algebra of Gω, when there is β : TeG →R satisfying (12.95). Let
us construct the isomorphism. Fix a basis T1, . . . , Tn in the Lie algebra of G, and a
corresponding basis
1 ⊕0, 0 ⊕T1, . . . , 0 ⊕Tn
∈T(0,e)R ⊗G
in the Lie algebra of R ⊗G. Consider the new basis in the Lie algebra of Gω:
1 ⊕0, β(T1) ⊕T1, . . . , β(Tn) ⊕Tn
∈T(1,e)Gω .
This is clearly a basis because the vectors are linearly independent if T1, . . . , Tn form
a basis. Consider the unique linear bijection f : T(0,e)R ⊗G →T(1,e)Gω such that:

738
12
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
f (1 ⊕0) := 1 ⊕0 ,
f (0 ⊕Tk) := β(Tk) ⊕Tk
for k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
We claim it preserves brackets:
[ f (r ⊕T ) , f (r′ ⊕T ′)]ω = f ([r ⊕T , r′ ⊕T ]⊗) ,
and hence is an isomorphism. As f is linear and brackets are bilinear and skew, it
is enough to prove the claim on pairs of distinct basis elements. Evidently [ f (1 ⊕
0) , f (0 ⊕Tk)]ω = 0 = f ([1 ⊕0 , 0 ⊕Tk]⊗). As for the remaining non-trivial
commutators,
[ f (0 ⊕Th) , f (0 ⊕Tk)]ω = [β(Th) ⊕Th , β(Tk) ⊕Tk]ω = α(Th, Tk)[Th, Tk]
= β([Th, Tk]) ⊕[Th, Tk] = β

where Chks are the structure constants of G in the basis T1, . . . , Tn. Therefore the
universal covering of Gω is R ⊗G, and there is a surjective Lie homomorphism
Π : R ⊗G ∋(r, g) →(χ(r, g), h(r, g)) ∈Gω ,
such that
dΠ|(0,g) = f
(12.98)
(the latter determines the map uniquely, by Theorem 12.56). Now let us study Π,
exploiting the fact that Gω is a central U(1)-extension of G. Easily h(r, e) = e for
any r ∈R. Consider in fact the one-parameter group of R ⊗G
R ∋r →(r, e) = exp{r(1 ⊕0)} ;
Π maps it, by Theorem 12.55(c), to the one-parameter subgroup of Gω:
R ∋r →exp{r f (1 ⊕0)} = (χ(r, e), h(r, e)) = exp{r(1 ⊕0)} = exp{(r ⊕0)} .
The Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula (12.81) and the relations (12.96) give, for
any r ∈R around 0:
(χ(r, e), h(r, e)) = exp{(r ⊕0)} = (χ(r, e), e) .

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
739
As h(r, e)h(s, e) = h(r + s, e) by the properties of one-parameter subgroups, the
identity found extends to any r ∈R, so h(r, e) = e for every r ∈R. Deﬁne
χ(r) := χ(r, e). Then
Π : (r, e) →(χ(r), e) and χ(r)χ(r′) = χ(r + r′) for anyr,r′ ∈R.
The second equation follows because r →exp{r f (1 ⊕0)} = (χ(r, e), h(r, e)) is
a one-parameter subgroup. Setting h(g) := h(0, g) and φ(g) := χ(0, g), we can
write
Π : R ⊗G ∋(r, g) →(χ(r)φ(g), h(g)) ∈Gω .
(12.99)
Let us study the map h : (0, g) →g and prove it is an isomorphism. As Π is a group
homomorphism it maps the product (r, g) · (r′, g′) to the images’ product, so
(χ(r), h(g)) · (χ(r), h(g′)) = (χ(r + r′)φ(g)φ(g′)ω(h(g), h(g′)) , h(gg′)) .
This implies h : G ∋g ≡(0, g) →h(g) ∈G is a group homomorphism, the
domain G being a Lie subgroup in R ⊗G. But Π is onto, so h is onto, too. The
map Gω(χ, s) →s ∈G is a surjective Lie homomorphism by deﬁnition of central
extension,soweconcludeh : G ∋g →h(g) ∈GisasurjectiveLiehomomorphism.
By (12.98), it is easy to see dh : 0 ⊕Tk →Tk. Consequently, by (iii) of Theorem
12.56(c) dh is the differential at the identity of a unique Lie isomorphism from G
(subgroup of R ⊕G) to G. By construction it must coincide with h.
To ﬁnish take the multiplier function ω and φ : G →U(1). Then φ(e) = 1,
because Π : (0, e) →(1, e). Since Φ : (0, g) →(φ(g), h(g)) is a Lie homo-
morphism and the C∞structure of Gω is the product around the identity, there φ is
differentiable. The projection Π maps (0, g) · (0, g′) to the product of the images.
Therefore
(φ(g)φ(g′)ω(h(g), h(g′)) , h(gg′)) = (φ(gg′), h(gg′)) ,
so
φ(g)φ(g′)ω(h(g), h(g′)) = φ(gg′) ,
g, g′ ∈G.
(12.100)
There remains to ﬁnd a continuous unitary representation
W : G ∋g →Wg
inducing the projective representation γ . Since h : G →G is an isomorphism,
deﬁne
Wg := φ(h−1(g))Ug ,
g ∈G.
By construction this projective unitary representation induces γ , since φ(h−1(g)) ∈
U(1). At the same time, by (12.100):

WgW ′
g = φ(h−1(g))φ(h−1(g′))UgUg′
= ω(g, g′)φ(h−1(g))φ(h−1(g′))Ugg′ = φ(gg′)Ugg′ = Wgg′ .
Hence W is a proper unitary representation. To ﬁnish we show W is continuous. As
U is continuous around e, h−1 is continuous, h−1(e) = e and φ is continuous around
e, then g →Wg = φ(h−1(g))Ug is certainly continuous on a neighbourhood A of e.
That W is a representation of unitary operators implies its continuity (in the strong
topology) at every point. In fact, if ψ ∈H:
||Wgψ −Wg0ψ|| = ||Wg−1
0 (Wgψ −Wg0ψ)|| = ||Wg−1
0 gψ −ψ|| →0 as g →g0.
We used the fact that g−1
0 g ∈A if g is sufﬁciently close to g0, as G is a topological
group.
⊓⊔
Remarks 12.73 (1) By a previous remark, Bargmann’s theorem provides informa-
tions also in case the connected Lie group is not simply connected, by looking at
its projective representations as representations of the (simply connected) universal
covering.
(2) An alternative, and more sophisticated, way to state Bargmann’s theorem relies
on the cohomology theory of Lie groups.
Deﬁnition 12.74 If (V, { , }) is a real Lie algebra, let Z 2(V, R) indicate the real
vector space of real bilinear skew-symmetric maps α : V × V →R that have the
property
α(R, {S, T }) + α(S, {T, R}) + α(T, {R, S}) = 0 for any S, R, T ∈V ,
and let B2(V, R) be the subspace of Z2(V, R) consisting of maps of the form
V × V ∋(S, T ) →β({S, T })
for every linear β : V →R.
The quotient H 2(V, R) := Z2(V, R)/B2(V, R) (viewed as an additive group) is the
real second cohomology group of V.
It is now obvious that the existence of a linear map β for every bilinear skew map α
satisfying (12.94) is equivalent to imposing that the real second cohomology group
H 2(TeG, R) of the Lie algebra of G is trivial: namely, that it is made of the zero
element 0 only.
(3) It is worth stressing that Bargmann’s theorem gives sufﬁcient conditions for
every continuous projective G-representation to be induced by a strongly continuous
unitary representation. These conditions may still fail, but a certain continuous pro-
jective G-representation (induced by a unitary representation of some 
Gω according
to Theorem 12.71, and therefore associated to some particular α ∈H 2(TeG, R)) is
nevertheless induced by a strongly continuous unitary representation. The argument

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
741
of Bargmann’s proof actually also shows that this happens exactly for the continuous
projective G-representation whose α equals zero as an element in H 2(TeG, R).
Proposition 12.75 Let G ∋g →γ be a continuous projective representation of a
connected simply connected Lie group G on the Hilbert space H.
Suppose that γ is induced by a strongly continuous unitary representation of a
central extension Gω as in Theorem 12.71. If ω is represented on TeG by the map α
such that [α] = [0] ∈H 2(TeG, R), then there exists a strongly continuous unitary
representation G ∋g →Ug ∈H such that
γg(ρ) = UgρU −1
g
if g ∈G for any ρ ∈S(H).
Proof We established this during the proof of Bargmann’s theorem.
⊓⊔
(4)ThediscussionbeforethestatementBargmann’stheoremimpliesthat H 2(TeG, R)
retains relevant information about the class of smoothly inequivalent (Lie) central
extensions of a connected Lie group G. This is because every such central extension
Gω deﬁnes a corresponding element α ∈Z2(TeG, R). Furthermore, suppose that
α, α′ are associated to central extensions Gω and G′
ω and these extensions are equiv-
alent under an assignment of phases, smooth on a neighbourhood of the identity of
G,
K : G ∋g →χg ∈U(1) where χe = 1,
(12.101)
(i.e. ω(g, g′) = χgχg′χ−1
gg′ω′(g, g) for any g, g′ ∈G). Then
φK : Gω ∋(χ, g) →(χgχ, g) ∈Gω′
(12.102)
is a local Lie group isomorphism, as one proves without effort. It is easy to see that
dφK : TeGω ∋r ⊕T →(r + β(T )) ⊕T ∈Gω′ ,
for some linear map β : TeG →TeG. Since dφK is a Lie algebra isomorphism and
the Lie bracket has the form (12.96), then
α′(T, S) = α(T, S) + β([T, S]) for any T, S ∈TeG.
In other words, central extensions Gω and G′
ω that are equivalent under a locally
smooth change of phase deﬁne maps α and α′ in the same class in H 2(TeG, R).
(5) An important result is that Bargmann’s theorem holds for connected simply
connected Lie groups G whose Lie algebra is simple or semisimple [Bar54].
Proposition 12.76 If the real Lie algebra (V, {·, ·}) is simple or semisimple, then
H 2(V, R) = {0}.
The result extends to Lie algebras of afﬁne groups, like the Poincaré group [Bar54].

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
Physically important cases where Bargmann’s theorem applies are [Bar54]
SL(2, C) (the universal covering of the proper orthochronous Lorentz group) and
the universal covering of the connected component at the identity of the Poincaré
group. In particular the Lie algebra of the former is semisimple. Therefore, within
relativistic quantum theories one can always take advantage of Bargmann’s theorem
to deal with spacetime symmetries. Conversely, the treatment of spacetime sym-
metries in Galilean quantum mechanics is much more complicated, as we shall see
soon, just because H 2(TeG, R) is non-trivial when G is (the universal covering of
the connected component of the) Galilean group. Non-trivial elements of the group
H 2(TeG, R) classify the possible inequivalent central extensions of G: the latter are
parametrised by a number corresponding to the mass of the physical system.
Example 12.77
(1) The Abelian Lie group R is the simplest instance, yet far from trivial, to which
Bargmann’s theorem applies. The assumptions are automatic, for the Lie algebra is
R with zero bracket, and the only skew functional α : R × R →R is the null map.
However, the result is not obvious, as conﬁrmed by the fact that we proved it with a
certain effort using Theorem 12.45 (only the topological group structure, actually).
The same arguments applies to the Abelian group U(1).
(2) Consider the simply connected Lie group SU(2), and indirectly SO(3), which has
SU(2) as universal covering (Examples 12.65(5, 6)). We want to prove all continuous
projective unitary SU(2)-representations (hence of SO(3) by Proposition 12.69)
are induced by corresponding strongly continuous unitary SU(2)-representations,
because the latter’s Lie algebra beﬁts Bargmann’s theorem. Actually this follows
from the fact that the Lie algebra of SU(2) is semisimple and from Proposition
12.76, but we intend to present an explicit proof.
The Lie algebra su(2) of SU(2) (Example 12.65(6)) has a basis made of −iσk/2,
where σ1, σ2, σ3 are the Pauli matrices seen several times. Identify su(2) with R3
by the vector space isomorphism that sends the basis of su(2) to the canonical basis
e1, e2, e3 of R3. Every linear skew functional α : su(2) × su(2) →R is a real skew-
symmetric matrix A, in the sense there is a unique real skew-symmetric 3×3 matrix
A such that α(u, v) = 3
i, j=1 ui Ai jvk, u, v ∈R3 (the proof is left to the reader). By
(12.86), condition (12.95) reads, in terms of the A associated to the functional α,

for any u, v ∈R3 (i.e. su(2)) and a given linear functional β : R3 →R (to be

for any u, v ∈R3 and some b ∈R3 whose components bk = β(ek) determine
β. Observe that the vector b, i.e. the functional β satisfying (12.95), exists, since
every real skew matrix A acting on R3 corresponds one-to-one to some b ∈R3:
Ai j = 3
k=1 εi jkbk (inverting bk = 1

3
i, j=1 εi jk Ai j), as is well known and as one
proves with ease.
Therefore condition (12.95) holds for any linear skew functional, and so
Bargmann’s theorem applies. Note that we did not have to assume (12.94) for
α : su(2) × su(2) →R, for it is granted: using α(u, v) = 3
i, j,k=1 εi jkuiv jbk,
where b ∈R3 determines α, a direct computation shows (12.94) is valid, because of
the known formula

Now we will discuss the converse problem: construct continuous projective repre-
sentations that give a Lie group of symmetries. We already know it sufﬁces to build
continuous unitary representations of the group’s central extensions, so we concen-
trate on the problem of manufacturing strongly continuous unitary representations of
a given Lie group (see [Schm90, Chap. 10] for a quick rigorous review). The idea is to
start from a Lie algebra representation in terms of self-adjoint operators, reminiscent
of the exponentiation of the generators of a Lie group. Physically, the procedure is
appealing because generators have a precise meaning. In the next chapter we will
see that the generators (self-adjoint operators) represent preserved quantities during
motion, if the time evolution is a subgroup of the symmetry group.
As ﬁrst step we construct an operator representation for the Lie algebra, in pres-
ence of a strongly continuous unitary representation of the Lie group. Consider a
strongly continuous unitary representation of the Lie group G
G ∋g →Ug
on the Hilbert space H. Fix a one-parameter subgroup R ∋t →exp(tT ) ∈G
associated to the element T ∈TeG. Stone’s Theorem 9.33 ensures
Uexp(tT ) = e−it AU (T ) ,
for any t ∈R,
(12.103)
where AU(T ) is a self-adjoint operator on H, in general unbounded (the sign −is
conventional, and we ﬁx it for future convenience) with domain D(AU(T )), and
completely determined by T ∈TeG. We will call the self-adjoint operators AU(T ),
T ∈TeG, the generators of the representation U. From Stone’s theorem they are

deﬁned as
AU(T )ψ := i d
dt |t=0Uexp(tT )ψ
iff ψ ∈D(AU(T )).
(12.104)
Regarding the fact the TeG ∋T →−i AU(T ) deﬁne a representation of the real Lie
algebra of G, we can only hope they satisfy:
[−i AU(T ), −i AU(T ′)]ψ = −i AU([T, T ′])ψ ,
(12.105)
ψ ∈D, where D ⊂D(AU(T )) is an invariant subspace for all the AU(T ), and that
the map TeG ∋T →−i AU(T )↾D is obviously (R-)linear.
As a matter of fact it is well known that such a D exists and is dense in H. A
candidate is the Gårding space DG.
Deﬁnition 12.78 (Gårding space). Let G be a (ﬁnite-dimensional real) Lie group
and consider a strongly continuous unitary representation G ∋g →Ug on the
complex Hilbert space H. If f ∈C∞
0 (G) and x ∈H, in analogy to Proposition 9.31,
deﬁne
x[ f ] :=

G
f (g)Ugx dg ,
(12.106)
where dg denotes the left-invariant Haar measure on G (the normalisation does not
matter) and the integral is deﬁned in a weak sense exploiting Riesz’ lemma: since
the map H ∋x →

G f (g)(y|Ugx)dg is continuous (the proof being elementary),
x[ f ] is the unique vector in H such that
(y|x[ f ]) =

G
f (g)(y|Ugx)dg ,
∀y ∈H .
The complex span of vectors x[ f ] ∈H with f ∈C∞
0 (G; C) and x ∈H is called the
Gårding space of the representation and is denoted by DG.
The subspace DG enjoys very remarkable properties stated in the next theorem. In
the following Lg : C∞
0 (G) →C∞
0 (G) denotes the standard left action of g ∈G on
complex-valued, smooth, compactly supported functions deﬁned on G:
(Lg f )(h) := f (g−1h) ∀h ∈G ,
(12.107)
and, if T ∈TeG, XT : C∞
0 (G) →C∞
0 (G) is the smooth vector ﬁeld on G (a smooth
differential operator) deﬁned by:
(XT ( f )) (g) := lim
t→0
f (exp(−tT)g) −f (g)
t
∀g ∈G .
(12.108)
Then the map
TeG ∋T →XT
(12.109)

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
745
deﬁnes a representation of the Lie algebra TeG in terms of vector ﬁelds (differential
operators) on C∞
0 (G). In particular,
XT ◦XT ′ −XT ′ ◦XT = X[T,T ′] .
(12.110)
We have the following theorem, establishing that the Gårding space has all the
expected properties.
Theorem 12.79 (Gårding) Let G be a Lie group and consider a strongly continuous
unitary representation G ∋g →Ug on the complex Hilbert space H. The Gårding
space DG satisﬁes the following properties.
(a) DG is dense in H.
(b) If g ∈G, then Ug(DG) ⊂DG. In other words the Gårding space is invariant
under the action of the unitary representation U. More precisely, if f ∈C∞
0 (G),
x ∈H, g ∈G, then
Ugx[ f ] = x[Lg f ] .
(12.111)
(c) If T ∈TeG, then DG ⊂D(AU(T )) and furthermore AU(T )(DG) ⊂DG.
More precisely
−i AU(T )x[ f ] = x[XT ( f )] .
(12.112)
(d) The map
TeG ∋T →−i AU(T )↾DG
(12.113)
is a representation by anti-symmetric operators on DG. In other words, the map
(12.113) is R-linear and (12.105) is valid if ψ ∈DG.
(e) AU(T ) with T ∈TeG is essentially self-adjoint on DG, namely
AU(T ) = AU(T )↾DG ,
∀T ∈TeG .
(12.114)
Remark 12.80 Item (e) can be strengthened: DG is a core for every operator
p(AU(T )) where p is a real polynomial of arbitrary degree (see, e.g., Corollaries
10.11.15 and 10.11.16 in [Schm90]).
■
Proof (a) Let f ∈C∞
0 (G) have support K f and satisfy f ≥0 and

K f f dg = 1.
From the very deﬁnition (12.106),
x[ f ] −x =

G
f (g)(Ug −I)xdg .
Hence ||x[ f ]−x|| ≤maxg∈K f ||Ugx −x||. Consequently, if we choose a sequence of
fn such that K fn shrinks to e ∈G, we have x[ fn] →x by continuity of G ∋g →Ug.
As x ∈H is arbitrary, DG is dense in H.
(b) This is easy because Ugx[ f ] can be written as

G
f (h)UgUhxdh =

G
f (h)Ughxdh =

G
f (g−1z)Uzxdz =

(Lg f )(z)Uzxdz = x[Lg f ] .

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
Notice that Lg f ∈C∞
0 (G) if f ∈C∞
0 (G), so that Ugx[ f ] ∈DG.
(c) Due to the invariance of the Haar measure if h(t) := exp(tT ) for T ∈TeG,
we obtain

G
f (h−1g)Ugxdg =

G
f (g)Uh(t)gxdg = Uh(t)

G
f (g)Ugxdg .
Hence
t−1(Uh(t) −I)x[ f ] =

G
t−1[ f (h(t)−1g) −f (g)]Ugxdg .
The function g →t−1[ f (h(t)−1g)−f (g)] is integrable on G and the limit as t →0
is XT ( f ) ∈C∞
0 (G). Moreover, the mean value theorem implies that
t−1[ f (h(t)−1g) −f (g)] = (XT ( f )) (h−1(τ(t, g))g)
for some point τ(t, g) ∈[−|t|, |t|]. As a consequence, it is not so difﬁcult to prove
that there is a function f0 ∈C∞
0 (G) with
t−1[ f (h(t)−1g) −f (g)] −(XT ( f ))(g)
 ≤f0(g)

of the functions G ∋g →(XT ( f )) (h−1(τ)g) for τ ∈I. If M < +∞is greater
than all values of the continuous compactly-supported function I × K ∋(τ, g) →

t−1[ f (h(t)−1g) −f (g)] −(XT ( f ))(g)
 ≤2M if
t ∈I and g ∈G. The function f0 can be deﬁned as a non-negative smooth compactly-
supported function on G that equals the value 2M on K ′.) Lebesgue’s dominated
convergence therefore implies that

G
t−1[ f (h(t)−1g) −f (g)] −(XT ( f ))(g)
 dg →0 if t →0.
(12.115)
On the other hand, a direct use of the Deﬁnition 12.78, the fact that |(Ug′x|Ugx)| ≤
||x||2 and Fubini–Tonelli produce

t−1(Uh(t) −I)x[ f ] −x[Xt( f )]

Therefore (12.115) yields −i AU(T )x[ f ] = x[XT ( f )] as wanted, including x[ f ] ∈
D(AU(T )) in view of Stone theorem.
(d) The fact that TeG ∋T →−i AU(T )↾DG is linear is obvious form (12.112)
because TeG ∋T →XT is linear, as can be proved directly. Making use of (12.112)
and (12.110), we have

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
747
[−i AU(T ), −i AU(T ′)]x[ f ] = x[(XT ◦XT ′ −XT ′ ◦XT )( f )] = x[X[T,T ′]( f )]
= −i AU([T, T ′])x[ f ] .
The fact that AU(T ) is self-adjoint and DG is dense and invariant, immediately imply
that AU(T )↾DG is symmetric, so that −i AU(T )↾DG is anti-symmetric.
(e) The proof descends from Corollary 9.34, noting that DG ⊂D(AU(T )) is
dense and invariant under the unitary one-parameter group generated by AU(T ),
because it is invariant under the whole representation U.
⊓⊔
From (b) and (c) it follows easily that, if ψ ∈DG, then G ∋g →Ugψ is a smooth
map (differentiating in the Hilbert topology and with respect to any local coordinate
system on G). In other words ψ ∈DG is a smooth vector of the representation U.
However an important result proves that also the converse is true (Theorem 3.3 in
[DiMa78]; the result remains valid if H is replaced by a Fréchet space).
Theorem 12.81 (Dixmier–Malliavin) Let G be a Lie group, G ∋g →Ug a strongly
continuous unitary representation on the Hilbert space H. Then ψ ∈DG if and only
if the map G ∋g →Ugψ is C∞.
There is another relevant subspace of H introduced by Nelson [Nel59], which turns
out to be more useful than the Gårding space to recover the representation U by
exponentiating the Lie algebra representation.
Deﬁnition 12.82 Let G be a Lie group, G ∋g →Ug a strongly continuous unitary
representation on the Hilbert space H. We denote by DN the space of vectors ψ ∈H
such that G ∋g →Ugψ is analytic in g, i.e. developable in power series in analytic
coordinates around every point of G.
The elements of DN are called analytic vectors of the representation U and DN
is the space of analytic vectors of the representation U.
Since the composition of elements in G is analytic with respect to the analytic atlas
of G, the Dixmier–Malliavin Theorem 12.81 has the following consequence.
Proposition 12.83 Let G be a Lie group, G ∋g →Ug a strongly continuous
unitary representation on the Hilbert space H. The subspace DN ⊂H satisﬁes the
following properties.
(a) Ug(DN) ⊂DN for every g ∈G.
(b) DN ⊂DG.
An important relationship exists between analytic vectors in DN and analytic vectors
of the self-adjoint operators AU(T ) according to Chap.9.
Proposition 12.84 Let G be a Lie group, G ∋g →Ug a strongly continuous
unitary representation on the Hilbert space H. Fix a basis T1, . . . , Tn of TeG. Then
ψ ∈DN if and only if ψ is an analytic vector for every skew-symmetric operator

Proof The proof immediately follows from Lemma 7.1 and the comment at the top
of p. 575 in [Nel59]).
⊓⊔
Nelson [Nel59] proved an important result ((b) in the theorem below), which implies
that DN is not trivial, and is even dense in H. It involves an operator, called Nelson
operator, that sometimes is related to the Casimir operators of the group represented.
Proposition 12.85 Let G be a Lie group and G ∋g →Ug a strongly continuous
unitary representation on the Hilbert space H. Take T1, . . . , Tn ∈TeG a basis and
deﬁne Nelson’s operator as the non-negative symmetric operator

(12.116)
Then
(a) Δ is essentially self-adjoint.
(b) Every analytic vector of Δ belongs to DN, so that DN is dense.
Proof It is useful to remember that the analytic vectors of a self-adjoint operator
(Δ) are dense by Proposition 9.25(f). (b) is proved in in [Nel59, Theorem 3]. The
comment after that proof proves (a).
⊓⊔
Remark 12.86 Nelson’s operator was originally introduced [Nel59] as the elliptic
second-order differential operator n
k=1 TkTk, where each Tk is interpreted as left-
invariant vector ﬁeld on the Lie group G. Our −Δ is a representation of that dif-
ferential operator through the unique extension of the representation TeG ∋T →
−i AU(T )|DG to a representation of the universal enveloping algebra generated by
TeG [Nel59].

. Summing up, (12.117) holds. The second equation in
(a) summarises the above argument to prove (12.117). Parts (b) and (c) are easy. If
T ∈TeG, we can complete T1 = T to a basis by adding n −1 suitable vectors.
Clearly DN is a core for the trivial linear combination AU(T ) = AU(T1) since it is
essentially self-adjoint on DN as we have just seen. Proposition 9.25(d) yields now
the ﬁnal expansion (12.118).
⊓⊔
The validity of expansion (12.118) shows a feature of DN which DG does not possess:
DN permits us to reconstruct part of the action of the (representation of) the group
fromtheactionoftherepresentativesoftheLiealgebraontheHilbertspace.However,
it is not evident that the restriction of AU(T ) to DN deﬁnes a proper representation
of TeG as T varies. This would be true if we replaced DN by DG, but with this
change (12.118) generally fails. The next theorem collects various results due to R.
Goodman [Goo69]13 and sorts out all problems.
Theorem 12.88 Let G be a connected Lie group and G ∋g →Ug a strongly
continuous unitary representation on the Hilbert space H. The subspace DN ⊂H
has the following properties.
(a) ψ ∈DN if and only if ψ is an analytic vector of

I + Δ, where Δ is deﬁned
by (12.116) with respect to any ﬁxed basis of TeG.
(b) DN is invariant under AU(T ) if T ∈TeG.
(c) TeG ∋T →−i AU(T )↾DN is a representation of TeG by skew-symmetric
operators (with AU(T ) = AU(T )↾DN ∀T ∈TeG and verifying (12.118)).
13Here the opposite convention on the sign of Δ is adopted, and the representation of the Lie
algebra is constructed on the whole space of smooth vectors, which coincides with DG by the
Dixmier–Malliavin Theorem 12.81.

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
We can ﬁnally state the famous theorem of Nelson [Nel59] that enables to associate
representations of the only simply connected Lie group with a given Lie algebra to
representations of that Lie algebra.
Theorem 12.89 (Nelson) Consider an n-dimensional real Lie algebra V of oper-
ators −iS (with each S symmetric on the Hilbert space H, deﬁned on a common
subspace D, dense in H and V -invariant) with the usual commutator of operators
as Lie bracket.
Let −iS1, . . . , −iSn ∈V be a basis of V and deﬁne Nelson’s operator:
Δ :=
n

k=1
S2
k
with domain D. If Δ is essentially self-adjoint, there exists a strongly continuous
unitary representation
GV ∋g →Ug
on H of the unique connected simply connected Lie group GV with Lie algebra V,
that is completely determined by
S = AU(−iS) for every −iS ∈V.
In particular, the symmetric operators S are essentially self-adjoint on D, their
closures being self-adjoint.
The above assumptions were weakened by Flato, Simon, Snellman and Sternheimer
[FSSS72]:
Theorem 12.90 (FS3 (Flato, Simon, Snellman, Sternheimer)) Consider a real
n-dimensional Lie algebra V of operators −iS (with each S symmetric on the Hilbert
space H, deﬁned on a common subspace D, dense in H and V -invariant) with the
usual commutator of operators as Lie bracket.
Let −iS1, . . . , −iSn ∈V be a basis. If the elements of D are analytic vectors for
every Sk, k = 1, . . . , n, then there is a strongly continuous unitary representation
GV ∋g →Ug
on H, of the unique simply connected Lie group GV with Lie algebra V, that is
completely determined by:
S = AU(−iS) for every −iS ∈V
In particular, the symmetric operators S are essentially self-adjoint on D, their
closures being self-adjoint.

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
751
Example 12.91
(1) Consider two families of operators Pk, Xk, k = 1, 2, . . . , n, on a dense subspace
D ⊂H in a Hilbert space, and suppose they are symmetric. Assume they satisfy,
on the domain, Heisenberg’s commutation relations, seen in Chap.11 (where we set
ℏ= 1):
[−iXh, −iPk] = −iδhk I
k, h = 1, . . . , n.
(12.119)
We may add −i I to the generators. Then −i I, −iX1, . . . , −iXn, −iP1, . . . , −iPn
form a basis for the Lie algebra of the Heisenberg group H(n) on R2n+1 (see the end of
Chap.11). The Heisenberg group is simply connected. Nelson’s theorem guarantees
that if, on D, the operator:
Δ −I :=
n

k=1
X 2
k +
n

k=1
P2
k
is essentially self-adjoint (we should consider Δ, but it is clear that Δ is essentially
self-adjoint if and only if Δ −I is), then there is a unique unitary and strongly con-
tinuous representation H(n) ∋(η, t, u) →H((η, t, u)) on H with I, Xh =: Xh
and Ph =: Ph, h = 1, . . . , n as (self-adjoint) generators. Therefore if this represen-
tation of the Heisenberg group is irreducible, by the Stone-von Neumann theorem
(Theorem 11.55) there is a unitary transformation H →L2(Rn, dx) mapping Xh
and Ph to the usual position and momentum operators of axiom A.5, Chap.11 (for
n = 3 and with the obvious generalisation for n > 3).
An elementary example is to take n = 1, H = L2(R, dx), the operator X seen as
multiplication by the coordinate x, P := −i ∂
∂x , and deﬁning D to be the Schwartz
space S (R). In this case Δ −I coincides with the Hamiltonian of the harmonic
oscillator of Chap.9. The operator Δ −I has an eigenvector basis made by Hermite
functions (belonging in S (R)), which are a basis of L2(R, dx) as well. Hence Δ−I
(and so Δ, by Proposition 9.25) admits a set of analytic vectors (Hermite functions)
whose ﬁnite combinations are dense in the Hilbert space. By Nelson’s criterion Δ−I
is essentially self-adjoint, and we may apply the above result.
(2) We have a result about commuting spectral measures.
Theorem 12.92 Let A : D(A) →H, B : D(B) →H be symmetric operators. If
there is a dense space D ⊂D(A2 + B2) ∩D(AB) ∩D(B A) on which A and B
commute, and where A2 + B2 is essentially self-adjoint, then A and B are essentially
self-adjoint on D and the spectral measures of A and B commute.
The proof is an easy consequence of Nelson’s Theorem 12.89.

A Few Words About Representations of Abelian
Groups and the SNAG Theorem
We summarise here the most important theorem concerning continuous unitary rep-
resentations of Abelian topological groups. Some preliminary notions are necessary.
Deﬁnition 12.93 Let G be a commutative, Hausdorff, locally compact group with
product · and neutral element e.
A character of the group G is a continuous map χ : G →U(1) such that
χ(g)χ(g1) = χ(g · g1) for all g, g1 ∈G.
The set G of characters of G is called the dual space of G.
Remarks 12.94 (1) It is clear that a character satisﬁes χ(e) = 1 and χ(g−1) =
χ(g)−1, and that G is an Abelian group with respect to the pointwise product of
functions, with unit element given by the constant function 1.
(2) A classical result by Weil [Wei40, Sect.2g] says that G is a locally compact
Hausdorff group when equipped with the compact-open topology. The compact-
open topology on the space C(X, Y) of continuous functions between topological
spaces X, Y has a basis formed by C(X, Y) itself and all ﬁnite intersections of sets
{ f ∈C(X, Y) | f (K) ⊂A}, for all open sets A ⊂Y and compact sets K ⊂X.14 ■
An elementary but important result is the following one.
Theorem 12.95 According to Deﬁnition 12.93, every χ ∈G is an irreducible,
continuous, unitary representation of G on C. Up to unitary equivalence, G is in 1-1
correspondence with strongly continuous irreducible unitary representations of G.
Proof If χ ∈G, the map χ : G →U(1) is evidently a strongly continuous irre-
ducible unitary representation of G on C. Now consider a strongly continuous unitary
representation U : G →H. Since G is commutative, every Ug commutes with every
other element Ug1. However, since U is irreducible, Schur’s lemma requires that
Ug = χ(g)I for a complex number χ(g) with |χ(g)| = 1. As UgUg1 = Ug·g1,
necessarily χ(g) · χ(g1) = χ(g · g1). Furthermore, the map G ∋g →χ(g) is
continuous by construction, so χ ∈G. Finally notice that, since Ug = χ(g)I,
every subspace of H must be invariant. This is not possible when U is irreducible,
unless H is one-dimensional. Therefore, there exists an isometric surjective operator
V : H →C. In particular, VUgV −1 = V χ(g)I V −1 = χ(g). In other words U is
unitarily equivalent to a character. This correspondence between classes of strongly
continuous irreducible representations and characters is evidently one-to-one.
⊓⊔
14The compact-open topology is Hausdorff if Y is Hausdorff. When Y is a metric space (as U(1),
in our case), the compact-open topology on C(X, Y) coincides with the topology of uniform con-
vergence on compact sets of X.

12.2 Introduction to Symmetry Groups
753
The result characterises continuous irreducible unitary representations of an Abelian
topological group in terms of its characters completely. The natural issue is to ﬁnd
how strongly continuous reducible unitary representations are built. The answer is
contained in famous theorem by Stone, Najmark, Ambrose and Godement. Tradi-
tionally referred to as the SNAG theorem, we shall state it without proof because
the argument is based on Bochner’s integration technique [Fol95]. The SNAG theo-
rem establishes that unitary representations are constructed out of irreducible unitary
representations by means of a suitable PVM deﬁned on G.
Theorem 12.96 (SNAG theorem) Let U : G →H be a strongly continuous unitary
representation of the Abelian, locally compact Hausdorff group G on the complex
Hilbert space H. Then there exist a PVM P, on the Borel sets of 
G equipped with the
compact-open topology, such that
Ug =


G
χ(g)d P(χ) .
The measure P is uniquely determined by requiring that for every x ∈H, varying
E ∈B(
G), μx(E) := (x|P(E)x) is the unique ﬁnite regular Borel positive measure
on 
G such that
(x|Ugx) =

G
χ(g)dμx(χ) for everyx ∈H and g ∈G.
Example 12.97
(1) Consider the additive group G = Rn equipped with the standard topology. Every
character χ : R →U(1) has the form
χy(x) = ei(y1x1+···+ynxn)
for all x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Rn ,
where y = (y1, . . . , yn) ∈Rn is arbitrary and uniquely ﬁxes χy. It is not difﬁcult to
prove that the compact-open topology on %
Rn coincides with the standard topology.
Consequently Rn and %
Rn are isomorphic topological groups under the map
Rn ∋y →χy ∈%
Rn ,
which is both a group isomorphism and a homeomorphism.
A strongly continuous unitary representation U : Rn ∋x →Ux on a Hilbert
space H can always be decomposed as

but the joint measure deﬁned in Theorem 9.19 for the n self-adjoint operators Ak

U(1) is made of maps

U(1) ≡Z coincides with the

Continuous Unitary Representations of Compact
Hausdorff Groups: The Peter–Weyl Theorem
This section contains a general theorem about strongly continuous unitary represen-
tations of compact Hausdorff groups: the celebrated Peter–Weyl theorem. Compact
Lie groups are covered, of course, due to their structure of differentiable mani-
folds. The theorem by Peter and Weyl states, in particular, two remarkable facts that
we will prove: strongly continuous unitary representations of compact Hausdorff
groups can be split in orthogonal sums (even with uncountably many summands) of
(topologically) irreducible representations, and strongly continuous irreducible uni-
tary representations are necessarily ﬁnite-dimensional. Both are far from obvious.
In particular, Theorem 12.66 proves that compactness is crucial, for Lie groups at
least. In general, a strongly continuous unitary representation of a topological group
might be a direct integral of strongly continuous irreducible unitary representations
(e.g., unitary representations of the Abelian Lie group R); moreover, there could be
inﬁnite-dimensional irreducible representations (like for the Lorentz group).
Let us start with a lemma taking care of the ﬁnite-dimensional case.
Lemma 12.98 Let π : G ∋g →Ug be a unitary representation (not necessarily
continuous) of the group G (even if not topological) on the ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert
space H. Then H decomposes in an orthogonal sum H = &n
k=1 Hk where for each
k = 1, 2, . . . , n:
(i) Ug(Hk) ⊂Hk for every g ∈G,
(ii) πk : G ∋g →Ug↾Hk is an irreducible unitary G-representation on Hk.
If G is a topological group and G ∋g →Ug is strongly continuous, so are all
maps πk.
Proof If π is not irreducible it will have a non-trivial invariant subspace ˆH1 ⊂H,
with 0 < dim( ˆH1) ≤dim(H) −1. Consider the new unitary representation of
ˆπ1 : G ∋g →Ug↾ˆH1. If this is not irreducible, as above we can ﬁnd a non-trivial π-
invariant space ˆH2 ⊂ˆH1 with 0 < dim( ˆH2) ≤dim(H) −2. The iteration stops after

a ﬁnite number of steps, since dim(H) < +∞, and produces an invariant subspace
H1 ̸= {0} for which π1 : G ∋g →Ug↾H1 is irreducible.
Consider H′
2 := H⊥

1 , since z ∈H⊥
1 and x ∈H1
imply (Ugz|x) = (z|U ∗

H = H1 ⊕H′
2 and π′
2 : G ∋g →Ug ↾H′
2 is a unitary G-representation on H′
2.
If π′
2 is irreducible we ﬁnish, otherwise we iterate to obtain H′
2 = H2 ⊕H′

π2 : G ∋g →Ug↾H2 is irreducible, H2, H′
3 are orthogonal to H1, π(H′
3) = π2(H′
3) ⊂
H′
3 and π′
3 : G ∋g →Ug ↾H′
3 is a unitary G-representation on H′
3. By induction
the algorithm is ﬁnite, and yields H′
k = {0} if k = n + 1 for n large enough,
because every Hk has dimension at least 1, so n
k=1 dim(Hk) ≥n, but we also have
n
k=1 dim(Hk) ≤dim(H) < +∞.
The last claim is immediate, because everything is ﬁnite-dimensional.

of the Haar measure of Example 12.38(5) in Theorem 12.39.

non-trivial closed subspace invariant under the representation considered.

Theorem 12.100 (Peter–Weyl, part I) Let G be a compact Hausdorff group and
π : G ∋g →Ug ∈B(H) a strongly continuous unitary representation on H ̸= {0}.
(a) If π is irreducible, then H is ﬁnite-dimensional: dim(H) < +∞.
(b) If π is reducible, it can be decomposed in a sum of strongly continuous, ﬁnite-
dimensional irreducible unitary representations of G. That is, H is the Hilbert sum
of mutually orthogonal closed subspaces H = &
k∈K Hk, where for each k ∈K:
(i) Hk ⊂H is ﬁnite-dimensional,
(ii) Ug(Hk) ⊂Hk for every g ∈G,
(iii) πk : G ∋g →Ug ↾Hk is a strongly continuous and irreducible unitary
G-representation on Hk.
Remark 12.101 Every representation πk constructed out the initial representation π
as explained in the theorem will be called a subrepresentation of π henceforth. ■
Proof From now on μG will be the Haar measure of G, which by Theorem 12.39 is
bi-invariant and may be normalised so that μG(G) = 1 (since G is compact). The

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
As in the proof of Proposition 9.31, using Riesz’s representation and the deﬁnition
of adjoint to bounded operators, Kx is well deﬁned and Kx ∈B(H). In particular,
since Ug is isometric:
||Kx y||2 ≤

G
|(Kx y|Ugx)| |(Ugx|y)|dμG(g) ≤

G
||Kx y|| ||Ugx|||(Ugx|y)|dμG(g)
so
||Kx y|| ≤

G
||Ugx||||Ugx||||y||dμG(g) = ||x||2||y||

= ||x||2||y|| ,
and then ||Kx|| ≤||x||2. Moreover
UgKx = KxUg
for any x ∈H, g ∈G .
(12.122)
In fact, Ug is unitary and UgUg′ = Ugg′, so

But z ∈H is arbitrary, so (12.122) holds. With this settled, let us begin to prove
(a). If the representation G ∋g →Ug ∈B(H) is irreducible, by Proposition 11.37
(Schur’s lemma) Eq.(12.122), valid for every g ∈G, is valid only if Kx = χ(x)I

Using (12.123) with x, y swapped allows to conclude the left-hand side equals
χ(y)||x||2, so that χ(x)||y||2 = χ(y)||x||2 irrespective of x, y ∈H. This means
χ(x) = c||x||2 for any x ∈H and some constant c ≥0. Set x = y, ||x|| = 1, so
(12.123) gives:

|2 dμG(g) = χ(x)||x||2 = c||x||4 = c ;
hence c > 0 because the continuous, non-negative map G ∋g →|(x|Ugx)| reaches
||x|| = 1 at g = e, and non-empty open sets have non-zero Haar measure (Theorem
12.39(ii)). To ﬁnish with (a), consider n orthonormal vectors {zk}k=1,...,n ⊂H. Setting
x = ek and y = e1 in (12.123) gives:

||e1||2dμG(g) = 1 .
Whichever c > 0, the number n cannot be arbitrarily large: it must be ﬁnite. Therefore
the dimension of H is ﬁnite and not bigger than 1/c. This concludes (a).
(b). For this we need a lemma.

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
Lemma 12.102 Suppose that for every non-trivial closed subspace H1 ⊆H such
that Ug(H1) ⊂H1, g ∈G, there exists a non-trivial ﬁnite-dimensional space H0 ⊂
H1 such that, for any g ∈G, Ug(H0) ⊂H0 and G ∋g →π↾H0 is irreducible on H0.
Then H is the Hilbert sum of mutually orthogonal, closed subspaces H = &
k∈K Hk,
where for each k ∈K:
(i) Hk ⊂H is ﬁnite-dimensional,
(ii) Ug(Hk) ⊂Hk for every g ∈G,
(iii) πk : G ∋g →Ug ↾Hk is a strongly continuous and irreducible unitary
G-representation on Hk.
Proof of Lemma 12.102. Consider the family Z = {H j} j∈J, where J has arbi-
trary cardinality and the sets H j ⊂H are ﬁnite-dimensional, non-null and such that
π(H j) ⊂H j, H j ⊥H j′ for j ̸= j′. Furthermore, we require π j : G ∋g →Ug↾H j
be an irreducible G-representation on H j. (Note that Z is not empty because, deﬁn-
ing H1 := H, our hypotheses guarantee the existence of a non-trivial irreducible
ﬁnite-dimensional subspace H0. The argument applies replacing H with H⊥
0 and so
on.) The π j are certainly strongly continuous since π is. Endow Z with the order
relation given by inclusion. Clearly any ordered subset E ⊂Z is upper bounded
by the union of elements in E . Zorn’s lemma tells we have a maximal element in
Z . By construction this is a chain {H′
m}m∈M ∈Z not properly contained in any
{H j} j∈J ∈Z . Now consider the closed Hilbert sum H′ := &
m∈M H′
m. By construc-
tion Ug(H′) ⊂H′, because every Ug is continuous. The orthogonal complement H′⊥
is π-invariant, because x ∈H′⊥and y ∈H′ imply (Ugx|y) = (x|Ug−1 y) = 0 since
Ug−1 y ∈H′, y ∈H′. Suppose H′⊥̸= {0}. Then H′⊥contains a ﬁnite-dimensional
subspace H0 ̸= {0}. By construction {H′
m}m∈M ∪{H0} is in Z and contains the
maximal {H′
m}m∈M, a contradiction. Therefore H′⊥= {0}, i.e. H = &
m∈M H′
m.
□
To ﬁnish the proof of part (b) it sufﬁces to prove the next result.
Lemma 12.103 Let H1 ⊆H be a closed non-trivial subspace such that Ug(H1) ⊂
H1, g ∈G. There exists a ﬁnite-dimensional non-trivial space H0 ⊂H1 such that,
for any g ∈G, Ug(H0) ⊂H0 and G ∋g →π↾H0 is irreducible on H0.
Proof of Lemma 12.103. From (12.121) and the inner product’s elementary properties
(Kxz|y) = (z|Kx y) for any x, y, z ∈H. Since Kx ∈B(H), we have K ∗
x = Kx, i.e.
Kx is self-adjoint. By (12.121):
(x |Kxx ) =

G
|(Ugx|x)|2 dμG(g) ≥0 .
At the same time |(Ugx|x)|2 = 1 if g = e, and by continuity (x |Kxx ) > 0 since
non-empty open sets have ﬁnite measure. Hence Kx ̸= 0 for any x ∈H. Now we
claim Kx ∈B2(H) (Kx is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator). For this it sufﬁces to show
Deﬁnition 4.24 applies. If {ek}k∈S indicates a Hilbert basis in H, a few manipulations
give

⊓⊔
Remark 12.104
Theorem 12.100, actually, applies to a wider class of strongly continuous represen-
tations of compact Hausdorff groups. Let π : G ∋g →Ag ∈B(H) be a strongly
continuous representation of the compact Hausdorff group G, given by bounded
(perhaps non-unitary) operators on the Hilbert space H. Using the Haar measure of
G, we deﬁne the inner product
⟨u|v⟩G :=

G
(Agu|Agv)dμG(g) ,
u, v ∈H
on H. This inner product: (1) is well deﬁned, (2) renders (H, ⟨| ⟩G) a Hilbert space,
(3) makes its associated norm || ||G equivalent (Deﬁnition 2.103) to the norm || ||
of ( | ). In addition, π : G ∋g →Ag ∈B(H) is a strongly continuous unitary
representation on the Hilbert space (H, ⟨| ⟩G).
■
We want to study further general features of strongly continuous unitary represen-
tations of compact Hausdorff groups. Some of them are encompassed in the second
part of the Peter–Weyl theorem, which we shall discuss later.
Notation 12.105 In the rest of this section, given a compact Hausdorff group G,
we will denote by {T s}s∈S a family of strongly continuous irreducible unitary rep-
resentations T s : G ∋g →T s
g ∈B(Hs). Later on we will assume the family also
exhausts, up to unitary equivalence, the class of strongly continuous irreducible uni-
tary representations of G. We adopt this notation also in Proposition 12.114 although,
there, irreducibility will be relaxed.
■
As a ﬁrst result we have the following proposition.
Proposition 12.106 Under the assumptions of Theorem 12.100, if T s and T s′ are a
pair of strongly continuous unitary irreducible representations of G, then the matrix
elements Ds(g)i j = (φi|T s(g)φ j) and Ds′(g)i j = (ψi|T s′(g)ψ j), in orthonormal
bases for the respective (ﬁnite-dimensional) Hilbert spaces, satisfy the following
relations:

G
Ds′(g)mn Ds(g)i jdμG(g) = 0 if T s and T s′ are not equivalent;
(12.124)
if T s and T s′ are unitarily equivalent, i.e. UT (s)(g)U −1 = T s′(g) for a unitary map

Proof Deﬁne operators Ei j : Hs′ →Hs by
Ei jψ :=

G
T s(g)φi(ψ j|T s′(g−1)ψ)dμG(g)
for ψ ∈Hs′. As the Hilbert spaces are ﬁnite-dimensional, the above integral is a
standard integral of Ck-valued functions. We claim Ei jT s′(h) = T s(h)Ei j for every
h ∈G. Indeed,
T s(h)

G
T s(g)φi(ψ j|T s′(g−1)ψ)dμG(g)T s′(h) .
If the two representations are not unitarily equivalent, since Ei jT s′(h) = T s(h)Ei j,
part (b) of Schur’s lemma (Proposition 11.37) entails Ei j = 0. Hence in particular

G
(φk|T s(g)φi)(ψ j|T s′(g−1)ψl)dμG(g) = 0 ,
which can be rephrased as

lj(g)dμG(g) = 0 .
We have found (12.124). If, instead, the representations are unitarily equivalent,
representing everything in Hs with respect to the same Hilbert basis, part (a) of
Schur’s lemma (Proposition 11.37) implies Ei j = λi j I, namely

⊓⊔
To state the second part of the famous Peter–Weyl theorem we need to use the right
regular representation of G, i.e., the strongly continuous unitary representation
R : G ∋g →Rg acting on L2(G, μG) by
(Rg f )(h) := f (hg) ,
g, h ∈G, f ∈L2(G, μG).
That Rg is unitary is a consequence of the fact that the Haar measure is bi-invariant,
if G is compact. The right regular representation turns out to play a crucial role
in the theory of unitary representations of a compact group G. A ﬁrst important
result, arising from Proposition 12.106, is that R subsumes all strongly continuous
irreducible unitary representations of G.
Proposition 12.107 Every strongly continuous unitary representation of a compact
Hausdorff group G is unitarily equivalent to a subrepresentation of the right regular
representation R : G ∋g →Rg in accordance with Theorem 12.100.
Proof Let T : G ∋g →Tg ∈B(H) be a strongly continuous unitary representation
of G. Call Di j(g), i, j = 1, . . . , dim H =: d the coefﬁcients of a matrix of T in a
Hilbert basis of H. For i arbitrarily ﬁxed, consider the functions e j(g) :=
√
d Di j(g)
for g ∈G. These functions are continuous and bounded on the compact set G. Hence
they are in L2(G, μG). Furthermore
(Rge j)(h) = e j(hg) =

d Di j(hg) =
√

In other words, the (closed, because ﬁnite-dimensional) space HT spanned by the d
vectors e j is invariant under the action of R, and the subrepresentation of R in this
invariant subspace has a matrix with elements

where we have exploited Proposition 12.106. This result proves that the restriction
of R to HT is unitarily equivalent to T , since these representations have the same
matrix.
⊓⊔
We focus again on the family of strongly continuous irreducible unitary represen-
tations of G and consider unitary equivalence classes. In every equivalence class
[T s] of irreducible unitary representations, we select a representative T s acting on
the ds-dimensional Hilbert space Hs common to the entire class [T s], thus obtain-
ing a family {T s}s∈G where T s is unitarily inequivalent to T s′ if s ̸= s′. The family,
moreover, exhausts the whole set of strongly continuous unitary irreducible represen-
tations of G up to unitary equivalence. A bit improperly, we call {T s}s∈G the family
of strongly continuous irreducible representations of G. The set of indices G is
actually in one-to-one correspondence to equivalence classes of strongly continuous
irreducible representations of G under unitary equivalence.
We are now in a position to state and prove the second part of the Peter–Weyl
theorem, which concerns the nice interplay between irreducible representations of
G and the right regular representation R.
Theorem 12.108 (Peter–Weyl, part II) Let G be a compact Hausdorff group.
(c) Let {T s}s∈G be the family of strongly continuous irreducible representations of
G. For every s, consider an orthonormal basis {φs

of T s, and the corresponding matrix elements Ds(g)i j = (φs

The subrepresentation of R given by the restriction to Hs
k, for each k = 1, . . . , ds
is unitarily equivalent to T s. Up to unitary equivalence, every element of {T s}s∈G
appears with multiplicity ds in the decomposition of R.
Proof (c) Let H ⊂L2(G, μG) be the closed subspace generated by the functions
Ds
i j, for all s and i, j = 1, . . . , ds. (These functions are continuous and belong to
L2(G, μG), as they are bounded on the compact group G with ﬁnite measure.) Our
goal is to show H⊥= {0}. The space H is R-invariant, because R is continuous and
the ﬁnite span of the functions Ds
i j is R-invariant, as immediately follows from the

proof of Proposition 12.107. As a consequence H⊥is R-invariant as well, because
each Rg is unitary.
Assume that there is v ∈H⊥\ {0} and deﬁne the function over G
u(g) :=

G
v(hg)v(h)dμG(h) .
(12.126)
It is continuous because, from (12.126) and the strong continuity of R,
|u(g) −u(g0)| ≤||Rgv −Rg0v|| ||v|| →0 for g →g0.
Therefore, as G is compact, u is bounded and therefore it stays in L2(G, μG) for
the measure of G is ﬁnite. Furthermore u ∈H⊥\ {0} because, again by (12.126),
u(e) = ||v||2 ̸= 0 and

Next we deﬁne w(g) := u(g) + u(g−1), which is again a continuous element of
H⊥: the proof is direct, just take μG(E−1) = μG(E) into account (Theorem 12.39)).
Consider the operator
(Aψ)(g) :=

G
w(gh−1)ψ(h)dμG(h) ψ ∈L2(G, μG) .
(12.127)
Since K(g, h) := w(gh−1) is continuous and G × G is compact with ﬁnite product
Haar measure, A is compact (Examples 4.18(4)). As the kernel w is real, A = A∗.
Since w ̸= 0, we have A ̸= 0 and therefore it admits an eigenvalue λ ∈R\{0} whose
eigenspace Hλ has ﬁnite dimension due to the compactness of A. If ψ ∈Hλ \ {0} we
have ψ ∈H⊥\ {0} because, applying the deﬁnition of A,

posed in a Hilbert sum of (strongly continuous) unitary irreducible representations
of G. The Hilbert spaces of these representations are ﬁnite-dimensional by Theorem
12.100. We end up with at least one ﬁnite-dimensional subspace Kλ ⊂Hλ ⊂H made
of eigenvectors of A, and supporting a unitary strongly continuous representation of
G. If e1, . . . , en is a Hilbert basis of Kλ, we must have

In particular, setting h = e

which is impossible since it would imply ek ∈H, whereas 0 ̸= ek ∈H⊥. We
conclude that H⊥= {0} as we wanted. Observe that ek(e) ∈C is well deﬁned since
the function G ∋g →ek(g) is continuous because it is an eigenfunction of A. The
continuity of the eigenfunctions of A follows easily from (12.127), by noting that w
is continuous and then arguing as for the continuity of u (12.126).
(d) The proof is easy. Consider the Hilbert basis made by the Ds
i j, where i, j =
1, . . . , ds and s labels inequivalent irreducible representations, and let Hs be the
closed subspace spanned by the Ds
i j with ﬁxed i. This space supports exactly ds
irreducible, strongly continuous representations of G acting on orthogonal subspaces
whose sum is Hs itself. In fact, for k ﬁxed in {1, . . . , ds}, the subspace Hs

spanned by the orthonormal functions e(sk)

as established in the proof of Proposition 12.107. For s ̸= s′ we have Hs ⊥Hs′

k′. Finally, from Proposition 12.107, every strongly con-
tinuous unitary irreducible representation of G is unitarily equivalent to one of the
representations acting on some Hs
k.
⊓⊔
The last, remarkable, result by Peter and Weyl regards the dense span of the
√ds Ds
i j. We already know that these functions span a dense set in L2(G, μG). And
we know they are continuous. As a matter of fact, the Hilbert basis of the √ds Ds
i j
can be used to approximate every continuous function of G in the natural topology
of the space of continuous maps over compact sets. We need a pair of lemmas that
are interesting in their own right.

Lemma 12.110 Let G be a compact group and f : G →C a continuous function.
For every ε > 0 there exists an open neighbourhood Vε of e ∈G such that | f (x) −
f (y)| < ε when xy−1 ∈Vε.
Proof Fix y ∈G. Since f is continuous, for every ε > 0 there is an open neigh-
bourhood Uε of y such that | f (x) −f (y)| < ε/2 if x ∈Uε. Deﬁning the open

Characters of Finite-Dimensional Group
Representations
A technically useful notion is that of character of a ﬁnite-dimensional representation
of a group.
Deﬁnition 12.112 The character of a ﬁnite-dimensional unitary group representa-
tion G ∋g →Tg ∈B(H) is the map
G ∋g →χ(g) := tr(Tg) ∈C .
Remark 12.113 This notion is evidently related to the one of Deﬁnition 12.93. If G
is Abelian and χ : G →U(1) is a character for Deﬁnition 12.93, χ is a character for
Deﬁnition 12.112: in fact, tr(χ(g)) = χ(g) when we think of χ(g) as an operator
on the one-dimensional Hilbert space C.
■
Proposition 12.106 and the deﬁnition of character of a representation entail the fol-
lowing elementary but very useful proposition.
Proposition 12.114 The characters χ of a ﬁnite-dimensional unitary representation
T of a group G satisfy the following properties.
(a) χ(h−1gh) = χ(g) if h, g ∈G.
(b) χ(g−1) = χ(g) if g ∈G.
Assume that G is Hausdorff and compact, and T is strongly continuous.
(c) If the representations T and T ′ are irreducible, the associated characters χ and
χ′ satisfy
(i) χ = χ′ if T and T ′ are unitarily equivalent.
(ii)

G χ(g)χ′(g)dμG(g) = 1 if T and T ′ are unitarily equivalent.
(iii)

G χ(g)χ′(g)dμG(g) = 0 if T and T ′ are unitarily inequivalent.
(d) According to Lemma 12.98, assume that the ﬁnite-dimensional unitary repre-
sentation T , with character χ, is decomposed in a direct sum of irreducible unitary

representations T 1, T 2, . . . , T n, where unitarily equivalent representations are iden-
tiﬁed and T k is unitarily inequivalent to T h for h ̸= k. Let us indicate the respective
characters by χ1, χ2, . . . , χn, with multiplicities m1, m2, . . . , mn. Then
(i) χ = 

i =

(iii) 

(e) A ﬁnite-dimensional strongly continuous unitary representation T of G is irre-
ducible if and only if its character χ satisﬁes

G χ(g)χ(g)dμG(g) = 1.
Proof (a) and (b) are immediate by deﬁnition of character. (c)(i) follows straightfor-
wardly from the invariance of the trace under change of orthonormal basis. (ii) and
(iii) are easy consequences of Proposition 12.106, by computing the traces of the
matrices in the integrals of the statement.
(d) According to Lemma 12.98, we choose as Hilbert basis of the Hilbert space
H of the representation T a union of Hilbert basis for each invariant irreducible
subspace. Then (i) follows from (c)(i) and the deﬁnition of trace. Eventually, (c)(i),
(c)(ii) and (c)(iii) immediately yield (d)(ii), (d)(iii) and (e).
⊓⊔
Remark 12.115 Items (a) and (b) are valid for ﬁnite-dimensional unitary representa-
tions of any group G. The remaining items (c), (d), (e) hold also for ﬁnite-dimensional
unitary representations of a ﬁnite group G, with NG elements. This can be proved,
disregarding any topological issue, by equipping G with the measure that counts
the number of elements, normalised by 1/NG. This measure is evidently invariant
under left and right translations. This is equivalent to replacing

In this section we discuss a few important quantum-mechanical examples of the
theory we have developed, with particular regard to the Peter–Weyl theorem applied
to SU(2) and the Galilean group.
12.3.1
The Symmetry Group SO(3) and the Spin
We now concentrate on unitary representations of the compact Lie group SU(2), seen
as the universal covering of SO(3) (Example 12.38(2)). With the aid of Bargmann’s
theorem and Proposition 12.69 (see Example 12.77(2) as well), unitary SU(2)-
representations will be used to deﬁne an SO(3)-action – by a continuous projective
representation – on the physical system made by a particle of spin s.
By Theorem 12.100 unitary SU(2)-representations are direct sums of irreducible,
ﬁnite-dimensional unitary representations. In the sequel we shall describe them.

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
Until now we discussed the quantum system of a particle on the Hilbert space
L2(R3, dx) (ﬁxing an inertial frame I that identiﬁes R3 with the rest space, with a
right-handed triple of Cartesian axes). Experience shows that this description is not
physically adequate: L2(R3, dx) is not always good enough to account for the phys-
ical structure of real particles. The latter possess a feature, called spin, determined
by an associated constant s, just like the mass is attached to the particle; this constant
can only be integer or semi-integer s = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, . . ..
Having a spin means, physically, that the particle possesses an intrinsic angular
momentum [Mes99, CCP82], and there are observables, not representable by the
fundamental position and momentum, that describe the intrinsic angular momen-
tum. Let us overview the mathematics involved, referring to [Mes99, CCP82] for a
sweeping physics’ debate on this crucial topic.
If a particle has spin s = 0 the description is the usual one for spinless particles.
If s = 1/2, the particle’s Hilbert space is larger, and in fact is the tensor product
L2(R3, dx)⊗C2, where C2 (seen as Hilbert space) is the spin space. The three spin
operators are the Hermitian matrices (for the moment we introduce the constant
value ℏ, only to set it to 1 subsequently for simplicity) Sk := ℏ
2 σk, k = 1, 2, 3 and
the σk are the Pauli matrices seen earlier. The commutation relations:


k=1

(12.130)
hold.Theassociatedobservablesarethecomponentsoftheparticle’sintrinsicangular
momentum in the given inertial frame system. For s = 1/2 the possible values of
each component are −ℏ/2 and ℏ/2, since the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are ±1.
For generic spin s the description is similar, but the spin space is now C2s+1. There
the matrices Sk of the spin operators, replacing ℏ
2 σk, are Hermitian, satisfy (12.130)
and have 2s + 1 eigenvalues −ℏs, −ℏ(s −1), . . . , ℏ(s −1), ℏs of multiplicity 1. For
m, m′ = s, s −1, . . . , −s + 1, −s, here is what they look like, explicitly:
(S1)m′m = ℏ

,
(S3)m′m = mℏδm′,m .
For the recipe to construct the Sk and a deeper analysis of the spin we suggest
consulting [Mes99, CCP82]. Here we just make three comments.
(a) The operator S2 := 3
k=1 S2
k satisﬁes
S2 = ℏ2s(s + 1)I
where I : C2s+1 →C2s+1 is the identity matrix.

12.3 Examples
771
(b) The space C2s+1 is irreducible under the SU(2)-representation given by expo-
nentiating −iSk:
V s : SU(2) ∋e−iθ ℏ
2 n·σ →e−iθn·S .
(12.131)
For s = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, . . . and up to unitary equivalence, the V s produce every
irreducible ﬁnite-dimensional unitary SU(2)-representation.
(c) The matrix S3 is chosen so to coincide with
ℏdiag(s, s −1, . . . , −s + 1, −s).
Typically the eigenvector basis of S3, i.e. the canonical basis of C2s+1, is denoted
{|s, s3⟩}|s3|≤s. Pure states Ψ (Ψ |
) are thus determined by a collection of 2s + 1
wavefunctions ψs3 in L2(R3, dx) with unit norm, and therefore a pure state is given
by a unit vector
Ψ =

|s3|≤s
ψs3 ⊗|s, s3⟩.
Because of this L2(R3, dx)⊗C2s+1 becomes naturally isomorphic to the orthogonal
sum of 2s + 1 copies of L2(R3, dx), so Ψ is identiﬁed with a column vector
Ψ ≡(ψs, ψs−1, · · · , ψ−s+1, ψ−s)t
of wavefunctions. In QM jargon these are called spinors of dimension s.
If s is an integer, the representation SU(2) ∋e−iθ 1
2 n·σ →e−i θn·S
ℏ
on C2s+1,
associated to the spin matrices, is a faithful SO(3)-representation, since the kernel
of the covering map SU(2) →SO(3) consists of the identity I and of −I. If s is
half an integer, instead, the above is a faithful SU(2)-representation.
One last important remark on the construction of the observables Sk and the
relative irreducible SU(2)-representations, found in all QM manuals and based on
the commutation relations of the Sk only, is the following. The purely algebraic
construction works because we assume the observables Sk are deﬁned on the whole
Hilbert space, and have discrete spectrum. This is theoretically not obvious, and is
merely due to the ﬁnite-dimensional ambient one works in, so the operators Sk are
Hermitian matrices. This is guaranteed by the Peter–Weyl theorem, provided one
uses irreducible unitary representations of a compact group like SU(2). The same
procedure would not work as well with non-compact groups such as the Lorentz
group.
This is the point where we start setting ℏ= 1 to simplify notations. We wish to
discuss the relationship between the total angular momentum and SU(2), or the
rotation group SO(3). For a particle of spin s let
Jk = Lk ⊗I + I ⊗Sk
(12.132)
be the (total) angular momentum operators on H = L2(R3, dx) ⊗C2s+1. The
orbital angular momentum operators Lk, deﬁned in (10.40) and discussed in
Chap.10, have as closure the observables associated to the components of the orbital

angular momentum. Above, the ﬁrst I denotes the identity operator on C2s+1 and
the second the identity on L2(R3, dx). The domain is the invariant linear space
D := S (R3) ⊗C2s+1. By construction these operators satisfy the bracket relations
deﬁning the Lie algebra so(3):
[−iJi, −iJ j] =


k=1
εi jk(−iJk) .
(12.133)
We wish to apply Nelson’s Theorem 12.89 to the Lie algebra spanned by the operators
Jk. Consider the symmetric operator
J 2 =
3

k=1
(Lk ⊗I + I ⊗Sk)2
deﬁned on D. It admits an eigenvector basis
|l, m, sz, n⟩:= Y l
mψn ⊗|s, sz⟩∈D ⊂L2(R3, dx) ⊗C2s+1
obtained from the basis of H, with l = 0, 1, 2 . . . ,, m = −l, −l + 1, . . . ,l −1,l,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., sz = −s, −s + 1, . . . , s −1, s, and where the |s, sz⟩∈C2s+1 are
unit eigenvectors of S3 relative to sz. As S3 is Hermitian, the 2s +1 vectors |s, sz⟩are
an orthonormal basis in C2s+1. The space L2(R3, dx) has a basis made by the Y l
mψn
of (10.50), Chap.10. Proposition 10.25 ensures the Y l
mψn ⊗|s, sz⟩form a basis for
the product space. The |l, m, sz, n⟩are not eigenvectors of J 2. The purely algebraic
Clebsch–Gordan procedure15 [Mes99, CCP82] shows how to build, out of ﬁnite
combinations of vectors |l, m, sz, n⟩, an eigenvector basis
| j, j3,l, n⟩
for J 2, Jz, L 2, where |l + s| ≥j ≥|l −s|, l = 0, 1, 2, . . . j3 = −j, −j +
1, . . . , j + 1, j, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (the j implicitly differ by integers). Then
J 2| j, j3,l, n⟩= j( j + 1)| j, j3, n⟩,
J3| j, j3, n⟩= jz| j, j3, n⟩,
L 2| j, j3, n⟩= l(l + 1)| j, j3, n⟩.
The | j, j3,l, n⟩belong in D being ﬁnite combinations of |l, m, s, sz, n⟩. As eigenvec-
tors, they are analytic vectors for J 2. Nelson’s criterion tells J 2 is essentially self-
adjoint on D. Then there exists a strongly continuous unitary SU(2)-representation
on H, by Nelson’s theorem, the generators of which are the self-adjoint operators
15Back when the author was an undergraduate, the procedure was impertinently known among
students by the cheeky name of computation of “Flash Gordon coefﬁcients”.

Jk := Jk = Lk ⊗I + I ⊗Sk. (Notice Lk ⊗I = Lk ⊗I since I is in that case
deﬁned on a ﬁnite-dimensional space.)
In the exercises we will show that the strongly continuous unitary representation
obtained when exponentiating the Jk, if s = 0, is an SO(3)-representation, and
coincides with the known one from Example 12.19(1), where Γ ∈IO(3) specialises
to Γ = R ∈SO(3). (The representation is strongly continuous owing to Example
12.46(1).) This fact easily implies (see the exercises), when s ̸= 0, that the SU(2)-
representation arising by exponentiating the generators Jk as in Nelson’s theorem
has the form:
SU(2) ∋e−iθ 1
2 n·σ →e−iθn·J = e−iθn·L ⊗V s 
e−i θ
2 n·σ
(12.134)
where Lk := Lk is the self-adjoint operator associated to the kth component of the
orbital angular momentum, as in Chap.9. Furthermore

(x) = ψ

e−θn·Tx

(12.135)
where
SU(2) ∋e−iθ 1
2 n·σ →eθn·T ∈SO(3)
is the covering map SU(2) →SO(3) discussed in Example 12.65(6).
Remark 12.116 Because of Proposition 12.69, the physical assumption is that
the projective SO(3)-representation induced by the unitary SU(2)-representation
(12.134) corresponds to the action of SO(3) on the spin-s particle, when we view
SO(3) as symmetry group of the system.

12.3.2
The Superselection Rule of the Angular Momentum
We consider a generic quantum system admitting a continuous projective representa-
tion of the rotation group SO(3) illustrating the physical effect of rotating states. We
may view the representation as a strongly continuous unitary SU(2)-representation
by Bargmann’s theorem and Proposition 12.69. Using Peter–Weyl we conclude the
system’s Hilbert space decomposes in a sum H = &
s∈A Hs of closed orthogonal
spaces Hs, on which irreducible, hence ﬁnite-dimensional, unitary representations
of SU(2) act. Each such is unitarily equivalent to one V s of the previous section,
where now s(s + 1) will not correspond to the spin squared of a particle, but rather
to the squared eigenvalue of the total angular momentum J 2 on V s, including orbital
and spin components. From the previous section the parameter s can only be integer
or semi-integer, s = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, . . ., so the index set A cannot be larger than
the set of those values. Suppose the set A of our physical system contains either type
of values. Let J3 be the self-adjoint generator of rotations about the z-axis, however
ﬁxed, corresponding to the component of the total angular momentum along z by

774
12
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
deﬁnition. Consider a pure state given by Ψ = ψs + ψs′ ∈Hs + Hs′, with s integer
and s′ semi-integer. Irrespective of the axis x3, and remembering the expression for
S3 of the previous section:
e−i2π J3Ψ = e−i2π S(s)
3 ψs + e−i2π S(s′)
3 ψs′ = ψs −ψs′ ̸= Ψ .
This is physically nonsense, for it says that a complete revolution (by 2π) about
an axis alters the pure state Ψ (Ψ | ). Therefore, when A contains both integers and
semi-integers, we need to assume a superselection rule for the angular momentum
that forbids coherent superpositions of pure states with total angular momentum
(the s giving the irreducible SU(2)-representations) partly integer and partly semi-
integer. As remarked in Sect.7.7, a pure state can have undeﬁned angular momentum,
when the state’s vector is a combination of vectors corresponding to pure states with
different angular momenta. The superselection rule, however, forces the values to
be all either integer or semi-integer. Another approach leading to the same result is
based on the time reversal symmetry and will be brieﬂy discussed in Example 13.22.
12.3.3
The Galilean Group and Its Projective Unitary
Representations
This subsection analyses the elementary structure of continuous projective unitary
representations of the Galilean group, viewed as a Lie group. We shall construct
the action of the group on wavefunctions adopting a physical viewpoint, that is,
supposing we know the physical meaning of (some of) the self-adjoint generators
of the one-parameter subgroups of the Galilean group. We shall ﬁnd that this action
is intrinsically projective unitary. This fact leads to a superselection rule of the
mass. However, another more mathematically minded and powerful approach is
available [CDLL04], whereby the irreducible projective unitary representations are
constructed from scratch as consequence of the structure of the second cohomology
group of Galilean group, and using the imprimitivity technology of Mackey. This
second approach is more general and the physical interpretation of the generators is
given a posteriori. Nevertheless, the physically meaningful representations arising
thus take exactly the form we shall ﬁnd by our way, and the superselection rule of
the mass shows up again.
In classical physics the transformations between the orthonormal Cartesian coor-
dinates of two inertial frames I , I ′ are elements of the Galilean group G . In
this sense Galilean transformations are passive transformations. With the obvious
notation we can write them as:
⎧
⎪⎨
⎪⎩
t′ = t + c ,
x′i = ci + tvi +
3

j=1
Ri jx j , i=1,2,3,
(12.136)

12.3 Examples
775
where c ∈R (not the speed of light!), ci ∈R and vi ∈R are any constants, and the
numbers Ri j deﬁne a matrix R ∈O(3). Every element of G is then given by four
quantities (c, c, v, R) ∈R × R3 × R3 × O(3). Composing Galilean transformations
rephrases as
(c2, c2, v2, R2)·(c1, c1, v1, R1) = (c1 + c2, R2c1 + c1v2 + c2, R2v1 + v2, R2R1) .
(12.137)
This composition law turns R × R3 × R3 × O(3) into a group, the Galilean group.
In particular, the neutral element is (0, 0, 0, I) and the inverse:
(c, c, v, R)−1 = (−c, R−1(cv −c), −R−1v, R−1) .
(12.138)
We may interpret Galilean transformations as active transformations, that actively
move spacetime events seen as column vectors (x, t)t of Cartesian coordinates (ortho-
normal, right-handed) in an inertial frame system ﬁxed once and for all.
The group G acts by matrix multiplication if we identify the generic element
(c, c, v, R) ∈G with the real 5 × 5 matrix:
⎡
⎣
R v c
0 1 c
0 0 1
⎤
⎦
(12.139)
and the columns (x, t)t ∈R4 with (x, t, 1)t ∈R5. In this way G becomes a Lie
subgroup of GL(5, R) (the analytic structure coincides with the one inherited from
R × R3 × R3 × O(3)).
In the sequel we shall reduce to the restricted Galilean group SG , the connected
Lie subgroup where R has positive determinant, i.e. R ∈SO(3). We will not consider
the inversion of parity, which is known to not always be a symmetry and must be
treated separately, at least at a quantum level.
The universal covering ,
SG , arises by replacing SO(3) with SU(2) (real Lie
group of dimension 3 inside GL(4, R)). As a matter of fact ,
SG is diffeomorphic to
R × R3 × R3 × SU(2) with product
(c2, c2, v2, U2) · (c1, c1, v1, U1) = (c1 + c2, R(U2)c1 + c1v2 + c2, R(U2)v1 + v2, U2U1) ,
(12.140)
where SU(2) ∋U →R(U) ∈SO(3) is the covering homomorphism of Example
12.65(6) (see also the exercises). This Lie group is the universal covering of SG ,
being simply connected (as product of simply connected spaces) and having the
same Lie algebra as SG .
An interesting basis, in physics, of the Lie algebra of ,
SG is given by the 10 vectors
−h , pi , ji , ki
i=1,2,3,

(note the conventional −sign in the ﬁrst one), where:

The Galilean group is in all likelihood the most important group in all of classical
physics, given that classical laws are invariant under the active action of this group.
Galilean invariance is a way to express the equivalence of all inertial frame systems,
interpreting passively the group transformations. We expect the restricted Galilean
group, seen as group of active transformations from now on, to be a symmetry group
for any quantum system in low-speed regimes (compared to the speed of light), when
relativistic effects are petty.
Projective unitary SG -representations describing the action of the symmetry
group SG on a physical system are well understood (see [Mes99, CCP82], for exam-
ple). To start discussing them, take a physical system given by a particle of spin s (cf.
previous section) and mass m > 0, not subject to any forces. Fix an inertial frame
system I with right-handed orthonormal Cartesian coordinates that identify the rest
space with R3. The system’s Hilbert space H is L2(R3, dx) ⊗C2s+1. Pure states are
wavefunctions with spin:

|s3|≤s
ψs3 ⊗|s, s3⟩
The wavefunctions 
ψ ∈L2(R3, dk) are given in momentum representation, and are

ℏ= 1 for simplicity. Assume s = 0 for a moment. In this representation of H, the

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
If k is understood as momentum vector, k →k +mv is precisely the transformation
of the momentum under a Galilean transformation that changes the velocity of the
frame of reference, but does not contain space or time translations, nor rotations. The
transformation corresponds to an active transformation of the wavefunction under a
pure Galilean transformation associated to −v. Eventually, incorporating the rotation
R(U), i.e. actively transforming the wavefunction by R(U)−1, gives:

Overall the right-hand side of (12.147) corresponds to the combined action (in agree-
ment with the Galilean product) of the subgroups of transformations. Bearing in mind
(12.138) our discussion now justiﬁes (12.145).
(2) The operators 
Z (m)g (i.e. the Z(m)g, in the position representation) are associated
to the universal covering ,
SG rather than the group SG itself. We made this choice
in order to apply the theory of previous sections. We know, in fact, that projective
representations of a group are obtained from the universal covering’s projective rep-
resentations, and this is particularly convenient because the Galilean group contains
a subgroup isomorphic to SO(3). We saw in the previous section that if the spin s is
a semi-integer, the projective unitary SO(3)-representations of physical interest are
unitary SU(2)-representations.
■
Using Deﬁnition (12.145), the representation ,
SG ∋g →Z(m)
g
(equivalently, ,
SG ∋
g →
Z(m)g working in the momentum representation) is projective unitary, due to
the presence of a multiplier function
ω(m)(g′, g) = e

,
g = (c, c, v,U), g′ = (c′, c′, v′,U ′)
(12.148)
after a boring computation. The result (clearly) remains valid in case the spin s is
non-zero, and the unitary operators 
Z(m)
g
generalise to the unitary operators (12.146),
because the representation U →V s(U) on the spin space C2s+1 is unitary and does
not affect the multiplier function.
It is easy to prove the projective unitary representation ,
SG ∋g →
Z(m)g (equiv-
alently ,
SG ∋g →Z(m)g in the position representation) is strongly continuous. To
that end, as operators are unitary, ω(m) is continuous and ω(m)(e, e) = 1, it sufﬁces
to prove 
Z(m)g
ψ →
ψ as g →e, for any ψ ∈H. This is an easy consequence of the
explicit form of 
Z(m)g.
We do not know whether the projective unitary representation ,
SG ∋g →Z(m)g is
equivalent to a unitary representation, by multiplying Z(m)g by suitable phases χ(g).
The Galilean Lie algebra shows that Bargmann’s Theorem 12.72 does not hold.
But the aforementioned theorem gives sufﬁcient conditions, not necessary ones, so
we are not in a position to answer the question. What we will see now is that the

12.3 Examples
779
representations found are intrinsically projective: they cannot be made unitary by a
clever choice of phase.
In order to keep general, we consider every possible projective unitary represen-
tation ,
SG ∋g →Z(m)
g , on any Hilbert space, with multipliers as in (12.148), but
irrespective of the fact the Z(m)
g
are as in (12.145) or (12.146) on L2(R3, dk)⊗C2s+1.
Proposition 12.118 Let ,
SG ∋g →Z(m)
g
be projective unitary representations with
multipliers (12.148) and m ∈R.
(a) Given m ̸= 0, it is not possible to deﬁne the phases of Z (m)
g
to obtain a unitary
,
SG -representation (nor strongly continuous).
(b) Representations with distinct numbers m cannot belong to the same unitary
equivalence class.
Proof We prove (a) and (b) simultaneously. If two representations with m1 > m2
belong to the same equivalence class, there exists a map χ = χ(g) such that
ω(m1)(g′, g)

ω(m2)(g′, g)
	−1 = χ(g′ · g)
χ(g′)χ(g) ,
g, g′ ∈,
SG .
(12.149)
Writing m := m1 −m2, this is the same as
ω(m)(g′, g) = χ(g′ · g)
χ(g′)χ(g) ,
g, g′ ∈,
SG .
(12.150)
We claim that for any given m ̸= 0 there is no function χ satisfying (12.150), proving
the theorem.
By contradiction if such a χ existed, letting Vg := χ(g)Z(m)
g
would force the
multipliers of ,
SG ∋g →Vg to be 1, hence the representation would be unitary.
Consider the elements in ,
SG of the form f := (0, c, 0, I) and g := (0, 0, v, I). By
(12.137) they commute, so f −1 · g−1 · f · g = e. The corresponding computation for
Z(m), keeping (12.145) in account, gives Z(m)
f −1 Z(m)
g−1 Z(m)
f
Z(m)
g
= e−i2mc·vZ(m)
e
. This
becomes, with our assumptions:

χ( f −1)χ(g−1)χ( f )χ(g)
	−1 V f −1Vg−1V f Vg = e−i2mc·vχ(e)−1I ;
as the multipliers of V are trivial because V is unitary by assumption, we have
f · g = g · f , and permuting the order of the coefﬁcients χh:

χ( f −1)χ( f )χ(g−1)χ(g)
	−1 V f −1· f ·g−1·g =

χ( f −1)χ( f )χ(g−1)χ(g)
	−1 Ve
= e−i2mc·vχ(e)−1I .
Therefore
χ( f −1 · f )
χ( f −1)χ( f )
χ(g−1 · g)
χ(g−1)χ(g) = χ(e)e−i2mc·v .

780
12
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
Using (12.150) this identity becomes ω( f, f −1)ω(g, g−1) = χ(e)e−i2mc·v. Comput-
ing the left-hand side explicitly, with the help of (12.148), yields
1 = χ(e)e−i2mc·v.
This has to be true for any c, v ∈R3, hence m = 0 and χ(e) = 1. But m = 0 was
excluded right from the start. The contradiction invalidates the initial assumption, so
χ does not exist.
⊓⊔
By virtue of this proposition, and since the quantity m labelling equivalence classes of
projective unitary representations has a very explicit physical meaning (for m > 0),
we might think that the symmetry group of a non-relativistic quantum system of
mass m, instead of being the Galilean group, is the central extension %
,
SG m given by
the multiplier function of the value m of the mass. From the general theory the rep-
resentation ,
SG ∋g →Z(m)
g
arises thus: (a) build the central U(1)-extension %
,
SG m,
with multiplier function (12.148) ( %
,
SG m is a product manifold since ω(m) is analytic
on ,
SG × ,
SG ); (b) restrict to ,
SG the strongly continuous unitary representation

,
SG m ∋(χ, g) →χ Z(m)
g
.
On that account, (intrinsically) projective unitary ,
SG -representations are substituted
by unitary %
,
SG m-representations. There is a price to pay: the symmetry group changes
when the mass varies. Consider the strongly continuous unitary representation
%
,
SG m ∋(χ, g) →χ Z(m)
g
.
Restrict to the space D ⊂L2(R3, dk) of smooth complex functions 
ψ = 
ψ(k) with
compact support. By (12.145) every map
%
,
SG m ∋(χ, g) →χ
Z(m)g
ψ
is smooth whenever 
ψ ∈D. Hence D is contained in the Gårding space of %
,
SG m.
With a minor notational misuse we indicate by D the inverse Fourier–Plancherel
image of D inside L2(R3, dx). Consider the 11 one-parameter Lie subgroups of
%
,
SG m generated by the Lie algebra basis:
1 ⊕0, −0 ⊕h, 0 ⊕pi, 0 ⊕ji, 0 ⊕ki ,
i = 1, 2, 3 .
Composing each one with %
,
SG m ∋(χ, g) →χ Z(m)
g
produces eleven strongly con-
tinuous one-parameter unitary groups. Let us ﬁnd their self-adjoint generators. If we
restrict to D when differentiating in the strong topology, the generators are (note the
−sign of H):

and

Since D is a core for all of the above, the self-adjoint generators of one-parameter
group representations of %

SG m associated to:
1 ⊕0, −0 ⊕h, 0 ⊕pi, 0 ⊕ji, 0 ⊕ki ,
i = 1, 2, 3
(12.153)
must coincide with the corresponding:
I, −H, Pi, Li, Ki ,
i = 1, 2, 3.
Each one, as an observable, has a physical meaning. We will talk about the observable
H in the next chapter. By considering Lie algebra relations, for instance on D,
we realise we are actually working with a central extension of the Galilean group,
because one bracket (the last one below) is new: the fault is of a central charge that
is represented by the mass:
[−i Pi, −i Pj] = 0 ,
[−i Pi, i H] = 0 ,
[−i Li, i H] = 0 ,
[−i Ki, −i K j] = 0 ,
[−i Li, −i Pj] =

εi jk(−i Kk),
[−i Ki, i H] = −i Pi ,
[−i Ki, −i Pj] = −mδi j(−i I).
Referring to (12.88), the central extension we have found is therefore determined by
α(ki, p j) = −α(p j, ki) = −mδi j ,
and α(a, b) = 0 in all remaining cases with a, b ranging in the basis (12.141). It
is possible to prove that this α (with m ̸= 0) does not comply with Bargmann’s
Theorem 12.72.

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
Remarks 12.119 (1) We started from a precise central extension of 
G based on phys-
ical requirements. Our results, however, are general and Proposition 12.118 holds
for every projective unitary representation of 
G . By Remark 12.73(2)–(5), in fact,
the direct inspection of H 2(TeG , R) proves [Bar54] that (a) every equivalence class
in H 2(TeG , R) contains a representative whose function α has the above form for
a precise value of m ∈R; (b) representatives with different m are inequivalent, i.e.
deﬁne different classes of H 2(TeG , R). In other words, m ∈R labels the elements
of H 2(TeG , R) bijectively, and consequently also the different (inequivalent) contin-
uous projective unitary representations of 
G . Having said that, physically speaking
the values m ≤0 have no meaning. Only m = 0 (as of yet, still ‘unphysical’) gives
rise to proper unitary representations.
(2) Since K j = mX j, the unitary representation (χ, g) →χ
Z(m)g incorporates oper-
ators that obey Weyl’s relations on L2(R3, dk). By Proposition 11.39(b) L2(R3, dk)

(3) If we take into account the portion of Hilbert space due to the spin, the difference

Z(m)g ⊗V s(U) ,
where g = (c, c, v,U). The irreducibility seen for the case s = 0 extends, so for the
particle with spin s the above representation is irreducible on L2(R3, dk) ⊗C2s+1.

12.3.4
Bargmann’s Rule of Superselection of the Mass
Now we shall consider systems more complicated than a free particle. We refer to
the next chapter for the general matter, and recall here that when we study an isolated
system of N interacting particles of masses m1, . . . , m N, the theory’s Hilbert space
splits:
L2(R3, dx) ⊗Hint ⊗C2s1+1 ⊗· · · ⊗C2sN +1 .
The Hilbert space Hint is relative to the system’s internal orbital degrees of freedom
(the particles mutual positions, for example in terms of Jacobi coordinates, e.g.
see [AnMo12] for a more explicit construction). L2(R3, dx) is the Hilbert space of
the centre of mass. The centre of mass of the system is the unique particle of mass
M := N
n=1 mn determined by the observables Xk (the position of the centre of mass)
and Pk (total momenta of the system), k = 1, 2, 3, of the usual form on L2(R3, dx).

12.3 Examples
783
Each factor C2sn+1 is the spin space of one particle. Via Fourier transform L2(R3, dx)
can be seen as L2(R2, dk), which we will assume from now on.
In this context – exactly as in classical mechanics – the symmetry group SG acts
by
,
SG ∋(c, c, v,U) →Z(M)
(c,c,v,U) ⊗V (int)
R(U)W (int)
c
⊗V S1(U) ⊗· · · ⊗V SN (U) .
Above,
SO(3) ∋R →V (int)
R
and R ∋c →W (int)
c
are representations – both unitary and strongly continuous – of the rotation subgroup
of SG (of elements (0, 0, 0, R)), and of time translations (of type (c, 0, 0, I)) respec-
tively. In addition, V (int)
R
W (int)
c
= W (int)
c
V (int)
R
for every R ∈SO(3), c ∈R. These
two representations depend on how we deﬁne orbital coordinates and on the kind
of inner interactions among the particles. The transformation Z(M)
(c,c,v,U) acts only on
the freedom degrees of the centre of mass. Since every representation involved is
unitary except Z(M), the multiplier function ω(M) of the overall representation on
L2(R3, dk)⊗Hint ⊗C2s1+1 ⊗· · ·⊗C2sN +1 is the same we had before, using the total
mass M as parameter m. Therefore the previous proposition reaches to this much
more general instance of quantum system.
Let us look at a physical system S obtained by putting together a ﬁnite number,
though not ﬁxed, of the previous systems. Or even more generally, we may assume
that the value of the mass of S, for some reason, is not ﬁxed. The mass of S may
then range over several values mi, with i ∈I at most countable. It is only natural
to associate to the mass a quantum observable, i.e. a self-adjoint operator M whose
spectrum is the values of mass (even if all that follows is completely general, explicit
models have been constructed in [Giu96, AnMo12]). Likewise, we deﬁne a Hilbert
space for the system:
HS =

m∈σ(M)
H(m)
S
,
where the H(m)
S
are the eigenspaces of the mass operator with distinct eigenvalues
m > 0. What happens if the Galilean group acts on S? A different projective unitary
representation Z(m), depending on m, will act on each H (m)
S
. The representation of
the restricted Galilean group will thus look like:
SG ∋g →Zg :=

m∈σ(M)
χ(m)(g)Z(m)
g
.
(12.154)
We claim this structure leads to a superselection rule. Since the representation is
projective unitary, the multiplier
Ω(g, g′) := Z(gg′)−1Z(g)Z(g′) ,

784
12
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
computed using (12.154), produces
Ω(g, g′)I =

m∈σ(M)
ω(m)(g, g′)Im ,
where the ω(m) account for possible new phases χ(m) and the Im on the right are the
identities on each H(m)
S . Since
I =

m∈σ(M)
Im ,
so
Ω(g, g′)I =

m∈σ(M)
Ω(g, g′)Im ,
necessarily we have:
ω(m1)(g, g′) = ω(m2)(g, g′) = Ω(g, g′) for every m1, m2 ∈σ(M) .
Bu this is not possible, because it implies, solving for χ(m), the false relation (12.149).
The net result is this: if the Galilean group is to be a symmetry group for our
physical system, we are compelled to ban pure states arising from combinations of
different subspaces H(m)
S . Therefore we have found a superselection rule related to the
mass, known as Bargmann’s superselection rule for the mass. The coherent sectors
of this rule are the summands H(m)
S
with given mass. The result is deeply rooted in
the fact that physically-interesting projective representations of the Galilean group
do not come from unitary representations, and the mass appears in the multiplier
function.
A physically more appropriate situation is that in which one replaces the restricted
Galilean group with the (proper orthochronous) Poincaré group: then the superselec-
tion rule ceases to hold, because irreducible projective representations of the Poincaré
group always arise from irreducible unitary representations [Var07], and states with
indeﬁnite (relativistic) mass are allowed.
Remark 12.120 Since m multiplies the exponent in (12.148), we may introduce a
central extension G1 of the Galilean group (of the universal covering to be precise)
that does not depend on m. It is enough to redeﬁne the multiplier by setting m =
1 in the right-hand side of (12.148). The value of the mass is subsequently ﬁxed
by a particular unitary representation (raising the multiplier and the variables χ ∈
U(1) to the mth power) when a physical system is chosen to have that mass and
to be invariant by the Galilean group. This extension G1 should be considered as
the quantum version of the Galilean group. This approach, adopted in [Giu96], lets
the superselection rule of the mass arise dynamically, by enlarging the system with
more degrees of freedom, already at the classical level. The mass becomes, a priori,
a (classical) variable and deﬁnes a self-adjoint operator (the mass operator of the

12.3 Examples
785
physical system) after quantisation. The approach was improved in [AnMo12], in
particular by presenting a physical procedure giving rise to the superselection rule
once the mass spectrum is supposed discrete.

12.1 Prove Theorem 12.23.
Proposition. If H ̸= {0} is a separable complex Hilbert space of dimension ̸= 2, an
ortho-automorphisms of L (H) is of the form
L (H) ∋P →V PV −1 ∈L (H)
for a given unitary or anti-unitary V : H →H. For dim H > 1, V is determined by
the automorphism, up to phase.
Solution. We ﬁrst assume dim H > 1. If h : L (H) →L (H) is an automorphism,
the map h∗: S(H) ∋ρ →h∗(ρ) ∈B(H), h∗(ρ)(P) = ρ(h(P)) for P ∈L (H),
is a Kadison symmetry. In fact, h∗(ρ) ∈S(H) easily follows from the fact that h
is an ortho-automorphism of L (H). Moreover, if ρ, ρ′ ∈S(H) and p + q = 1
for p, q ∈[0, 1], one has h∗(pρ + qρ′)(P) = (pρ + qρ′)(h(P)) = pρ(h(P)) +
qρ′(h(P)) = ph∗(ρ)(P) + qh∗(ρ′)(P), so that h∗is a Kadison automorphism. By
Kadison’s theorem, there exists U : H →H unitary or anti-unitary depending on
h∗, such that h∗(ρ) = UρU −1 (viewing ρ as a trace-class positive operator with unit
trace). Consequently tr(ρ(h(P)−U −1PU)) = 0 for every P ∈L (H) and every ρ.
In particular, (ψ|ρ(h(P)−U −1PU)ψ) = 0 for every ψ ∈H. Consequently, h(P) =
U −1PU, for every P ∈L (H), which is what we wanted (just rename V := U −1).
Finally, suppose that V and V ′ (both unitary or anti-unitary) are associated to the
same h. Then V ′V −1 commutes with every one-dimensional orthogonal projector.
The standard argument used in the proof of Wigner’s theorem shows that V ′ = eiaV
for some a ∈R. Vice versa, it is obvious that V ′ = eiaV and V , either unitary
or anti-unitary, deﬁne the same ortho-automorphism hV ′ given by L (H) ∋P →
V PV −1 =: hV (P).
If dim H = 1 the identity is the only automorphism. It will be unitary or anti-
unitary depending on whether we extend ψ →ψ linearly or antilinearly.

The triple P corresponds to the momentum’s components, and the identities hold on

operator UP satisfying
U −1
P XUP = −X ,
U −1
P PUP = −P ,
(12.158)
will also satisfy UP = eiaP for a real constant a ∈R (a = ±1 if, additionally,
U ∗
P = UP). Similarly, an anti-unitary operator UT satisfying
U −1
T XUT = X ,
U −1
T PUT = −P
(12.159)
will also satisfy UT = eibT for some real constant b ∈R.
Hint. Prove that PUP and T UT are unitary operators commuting with the Weyl
operators W((t, u)) of the Weyl algebra associated with the position and momentum
operators of our particle, as in Proposition 11.39. Then observe that the family of the
W((t, u)) is irreducible (Proposition 11.39) and use Proposition 11.37.
12.5 Consider the self-adjoint operators L1, L2, L3 representing the components of
the orbital angular momentum (Chap.10). If L indicates their column vector, then
L↾S (R3)= X↾S (R3) ∧P↾S (R3) .

Equip Sp(HS) with distance d(ρ, ρ′) := ||ρ −ρ′||1 := tr(|ρ −ρ′|), where || ||1 is
the natural trace-class norm. Prove the sets Sp(HSk) are the connected components

Sketch of the solution. Consider pure states ρ, ρ′ ∈Sp(HSk) with ρ = ψ(ψ| )
and ρ′ = ψ′(ψ′| ), and ψ not parallel to ψ′ (otherwise they give the same state).
Deﬁne ψt = tψ + (1 −t)ψ′ and prove the curve [0, 1] ∋t →
ψt
||ψt||2 (ψt| ) is
continuous and entirely contained in Sp(HSk). This makes Sp(HSk) path-connected,
hence connected. To prove the Sp(HSk) are disjoint, it is sufﬁcient to ﬁnd ||ρ −ρ′||1
for ρ ∈Sp(HSk), ρ′ ∈Sp(HSk′) with k ̸= k′. In that case the vectors of ρ, ρ′ are
orthogonal, so ρ −ρ′ is actually the sum of the positive and negative parts of the
element ρ −ρ′ itself. Hence |ρ −ρ′| = ρ + ρ′, i.e. ||ρ −ρ′||1 = 2. Consider an
open set Ak ⊃Sp(HSk) union of open balls of radius 1/2 centred in Sp(HSk), and
another open set Ak′ ⊃Sp(HSk′) union of similar balls centred in Sp(HSk′). These
two sets cannot intersect by the triangle inequality, so Sp(HSk) and Sp(HSk′) are
disjoint.

Introduction to Quantum Symmetries
Outline of the solution. The ﬁrst equality in (12.74) descends from UΓ unitary,
U −1
Γ0
= UΓ −1
0
and UΓ ′UΓ = UΓ ′◦Γ . Hence it is enough to show, for any ψ ∈
L2(R3, dx):
||UΓ ψ −ψ|| →0 as Γ →(0, I).
Let us prove this for compactly-supported continuous maps φ. As ISO(3) × R3 ∋
(Γ, x) →φ(Γ −1x) is continuous, if Γ restricts to a relatively compact neighbour-
hood J of the identity, there is K ≥0 such that |φ(Γ −1x)| ≤K if (Γ, x) ∈J × R3.
Because of Γ there is a compact set S ⊂R3 containing every support of φ(Γ −1·). So
there is φ0 ∈L2(R3, dx) such that |(UΓ φ)(x)−φ(x)| ≤|φ0(x)| if (Γ, x) ∈J ×R3:
it sufﬁces to choose a continuous map φ0 with absolute value larger than 2K at each
point of S, and vanishing fast outside S. Since (UΓ φ)(x) →φ(x) pointwise, by
dominated convergence ||UΓ ψ −ψ|| →0 as Γ →(0, I), in L2 norm. Let us pass
to ψ generic in L2(R3, dx). If ε > 0, take φ continuous with compact support and
such that ||ψ −φ|| < ε/3. Then
||UΓ ψ−ψ|| ≤||UΓ ψ−UΓ φ||+||UΓ φ−φ||+||φ−ψ|| = ||UΓ φ−φ||+2||φ−ψ||,
since UΓ is isometric so ||UΓ ψ −UΓ φ|| = ||ψ −φ||. Choose Γ close enough to
(0, I). By the above argument, ||UΓ φ −φ|| ≤ε/3. Hence for any ε > 0, if Γ is
close enough to (0, I) we have ||UΓ ψ −ψ|| ≤ε.
12.10 Using Exercise 12.2, prove t · P↾S (R3) is essentially self-adjoint.
Hint. If t = 0 the claim is trivial. Otherwise we know P1 ↾S (R3) is essentially
self-adjoint. Consider the unitary operator UR representing an active rotation moving
the axis t/|t| onto e3. Show URt · P↾S (R3) U −1
R

12.11 Using Exercise 12.2, prove formula (12.75).
Hint. Prove the statement for P3, passing from wavefunctions in x to wavefunc-
tions in k via the Fourier transform. Extend to the general case as in the previous
exercise. Note that U unitary and A : D(A) →H closable imply that U AU −1
(deﬁned on U(D(A))) is closable and
U AU −1 = U AU −1 .
12.12 Starting from (12.36), show formula (12.37).
Hint. First, substitute the neutral element e appropriately for one among g, g′, g′′,
then write g−1 in place of g′ and/or g′′.
12.13 Let G be a connected topological group and G ∋g →γg a strongly continu-
ous projective representation (Proposition 12.43) on the Hilbert space HS, associated

a function γg mapping a certain sector to a different sector?

Hint. Decompose Sp(H) in a disjoint union of pure states of each sector, and
equip sectors with || ||1. Remember that continuous maps preserve connected sets.
12.14 Prove that the Lie algebra of SU(2) is the real vector space of skew-Hermitian
matrices. Then show SU(2) is simply connected.
Hint. SU(2) is closed in GL(4, R), hence a Lie group. Therefore one-parameter
groups are of type R ∋t →et A, with A in the Lie algebra su(2). Impose et A(et A)∗=
I and tr(et A) = 1 for every t, and infer how A has to look like. Vice versa, suppose
A is skew-Hermitian and check that the above two conditions hold. As for simple
connectedness, parametrise the group by 4 real variables so that SU(2) is in one-
to-one correspondence with the unit sphere in R4. Show the parametrisation is a
homeomorphism.
12.15 Prove that U ∈SU(2) iff there exist a unit vector n ∈R3 and a real number
θ such that:
U = e−iθn· σ
2 .
Hint. Use the spectral theorem for the unitary operator U ∈SU(2), keeping in
account that the Pauli matrices and I form a real basis of 2 × 2 Hermitian matrices.
Conversely, if U = e−iθn· σ
2 , what are U ∗U and det U?
12.16 Prove the matrices T in (12.84) satisfy:

Hint. Use (Ti) jk = −εi jk and write the above equations component-wise. Recall
εi jk are the coefﬁcients of a pseudo-tensor that is invariant under proper rotations.
12.17 Show that R ∈SO(3) iff there exist a unit vector n ∈R3 and a real angle θ
such that:
R = eθn·T .
Hint. Prove the claim for n = e3 by taking, for R ∈SO(3), a rotation about e3.
Show every R ∈SO(3) admits an eigenvector n. Rotate the axes so to move n onto
e3, and recall the previous exercise. If, conversely, R = e−iθn·T, what are Rt R and
det R?
12.18 Demonstrate that for every U ∈SU(2) there exists a unique RU ∈SO(3)

is a surjective homomorphism that coincides with:
R : SU(2) ∋e−iθn· σ
2 →eθn·T ∈SO(3) .
Eventually prove the kernel is {±I} ⊂SU(2).
Sketch of the solution. Note |t|2 = det (t · σ), and conclude every U ∈SU(2)
determines a unique transformation of R3 mapping t to some t′, with |t| = |t′|,
deﬁned by Ut · σU ∗= Ut′ · σU ∗. The transformation t →t′ is then an orthogonal
matrix R(U) ∈O(3). That R : SU(2) ∋U →R(U) ∈O(3) is a homomorphism is
immediate by construction. In the case Uθ = e−iθ σ3
2 one checks in various ways (e.g.
directly, expanding the exponentials) that R(Uθ) = eθT3. The general case relies on
Exercise (12.16), rotating e3 onto an arbitrary unit vector n. Clearly, R(Uθ) = eθn·T
implies R(U) ∈SO(3). Surjectivity is a consequence of the fact that every SO(3)
matrix can be written as eθn·T. The kernel is computed by reducing to the one-
parameter subgroup generated by σ3, by rotation of n. The result becomes thus
obvious by direct computation.
12.19 Referring to Sect.12.3.1, prove the strongly continuous unitary SU(2)-repre-
sentation obtained by exponentiating the L k is the representation SO(3) ∋R →UR
of Example 12.19 (where Γ ∈IO(3) is now restricted to Γ = R ∈SO(3)), which
is strongly continuous (cf. Example 12.46(1)).
Hint. By Nelson’s theorem 12.89 it sufﬁces to check the one-parameter groups
θ →Ueθn·Tx, with n = e1, e2, e3, are generated by the self-adjoint elements L1, L2,
L3. It is convenient to work with polar coordinates, using the core of L1, L2, L3
given by spherical harmonics multiplied by a basis of L2(R+,r2dr).
12.20 Show that the SU(2)-representation obtained by exponentiating the genera-
tors Jk, by Nelson’s theorem, has the form:
SU(2) ∋e−iθ 1
2 n·σ →e−iθn·J = e−iθn·L ⊗V s 
e−i θ
2 n·σ
.
Hint. Employ the properties of the tensor product of operators to show
e−iθn·J = e−iθn·L ⊗V s 
e−i θ
2 n·σ
.
Hence we have to prove the representation SO(3) ∋R →UR of the previous
exercise can be written as Ueθn·T = e−iθn·L. This is certainly true, for instance, for
n = e3. As for the general case: on one hand we have
U ∗
Re−iθn·LUR = e−iθn·U∗
RLUR ,
and Exercise 12.5; on the other Exercise 12.16 holds.

12.21 Consider a strongly continuous unitary representation G ∋g →Ug of a

Prove the following facts.
(1) If E commutes with AU(T ) on DN for some T ∈TeG, then E commutes with
Uexp(tT ) for every t ∈R.
(2) If furthermore E is essentially self-adjoint on DN, then the spectral measures

Suppose that sE,ψ is the supremum of the real numbers t for which the above rela-
tion holds. If sE,ψ < +∞, the fact that E is closed and that t →e−it AU (T )Eψ is
continuous at t = sE,ψ immediately implies that
Ee−isE,ψ AU (T )ψ = e−isE,ψ AU (T)Eψ .
(12.163)
Deﬁning φ := e−isE,ψ AU (T )ψ and using again the same argument, we have that, for
some τ > 0,
e−iτ AU (T )Ee−isE,ψ AU (T )ψ = Ee−iτ AU (T )e−isE,ψ AU (T )ψ = Ee−i(sE,ψ+τ)AU (T )ψ
so that, from (12.163),
Ee−i(sE,ψ+τ)AU (T )ψ = e−i(sE,ψ+τ)AU (T)Eψ .
This is impossible by deﬁnition of sE,ψ unless sE,ψ = +∞. An analogous procedure
can be carried out for the inﬁmum of the numbers t such that

Eventually the inf will be −∞. We have found that

Since Ug(DN) ⊂DN, that means

But DN is a core for E, so taking the closure gives

Niels Bohr, to Einstein
With this chapter we complete the list of axioms for non-relativistic Quantum
Mechanics, by deﬁning time evolution and compound systems. Certain notions, here
deﬁned formally, have already been introduced in the ﬁnal part of the previous chapter
when we were talking about symmetry groups. More advanced reference texts, which
we have followed here and there, are [Pru81] and [DA10].
In the ﬁrst section we will state the axiom of time evolution, described by a strongly
continuous one-parameter unitary group that is generated by the Hamiltonian oper-
ator of the system. We will deﬁne dynamical symmetries as a special kind of the
symmetries seen earlier. Then we shall discuss the nature of Schrödinger’s equation
and introduce the important concept of stationary state. As a classical example of this
formalism we will analyse in depth the action of the Galilean group in the position
representation (we saw it in the momentum representation in the previous chapter).
We will also explain how wavefunctions transform under changes of inertial frame
systems. Then we will pass to the basic theory of non-relativistic scattering. We will
make a few remarks on the existence of the unitary time-evolution operator in absence
of time homogeneity (we will examine the convergence in B(H) of the Dyson series
for a Hamiltonian), and discuss the anti-unitary nature of the time-reversal symmetry.
In the following section we will present a version of Pauli’s theorem, whose
concern is the possibility of deﬁning the “time operator” as self-adjoint conjugate
to the Hamiltonian. In this respect we will brieﬂy discuss POVMs, which may be
employed to give a weaker meaning to the time observable.
Heisenberg’s picture of observables will be introduced in section three, where we
shall address the relationship between constants of motion and dynamical symme-
tries, present the quantum version of Noether’s theorem and study the case of con-
stants of motion associated to generators of a Lie group, including the one-parameter

subgroup of time evolution. A digression will give us the chance to present the math-
ematical problems raised by the Ehrenfest theorem. The section will close with the
constants of motion associated to the Galilean group.
Section four is devoted to the theory of compound quantum systems: systems
with an inner structure and multi-particle systems. We will consider, in particular,
entangled states and discuss some problems related to the EPR paradox and the
notion of decoherence. Eventually, we will pass to the general theory of systems of
identical particles, and ﬁnish with the spin-statistic correlation.
13.1
Quantum Dynamics and Its Symmetries
As we quickly recalled in Sect.7.2.1, physical systems evolve in time according to
their dynamics. In the classical Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics the evolution
in time of a system’s state is described in phase spacetime by the solutions to Hamil-
ton’s equations. Let us consider the situation in which the Hamiltonian function H
does not depend explicitly on time in the coordinates of a given inertial frame I .
We will talk in this case of time being homogeneous with respect to the considered
physical system. Hamilton’s equations are autonomous PDEs, i.e. the time variable
does not show up explicitly if the equations are written in those canonical coordinates
and the phase spacetime splits naturally in a product R × F, where F is the phase
space. The solutions to Hamilton’s equations determine a one-parameter group of
diffeomorphisms φτ : F →F mapping the initial state r ∈F, at time 0 (taken to
be sharp for simplicity) to the state φτ(r) ∈F, at time τ. The basic mathematical
tool to construct the time-evolution operator – the one-parameter group {φτ}τ∈R –
is the Hamiltonian H of the system, which is identiﬁed with the total mechanical
energy of the frame system I [GPS01, FaMa06]. In the sequel we will present the
quantum analogues of the Hamiltonian function and the evolution operator.
13.1.1
Axiom A6: Time Evolution
The quantum setting is not dissimilar to the classical case. The following axiom com-
prises time evolution in a quantum system S, described on the Hilbert space HS for
given inertial frame I , with homogeneous time. The axiom deﬁnes the Hamiltonian
(operator) of the quantum system as the generator of the one-parameter unitary group
capturing the evolution, hence the dynamics, of the quantum state. (We will return
to this in Sect.13.1.6 when looking at a more general situation.) Using the notion of
time evolution makes it possible to treat dynamical symmetries and, as we will see
later, state the quantum Noether theorem.
A6. Let S be a quantum system described on the Hilbert space HS associated to the
inertial frame I . There exists a self-adjoint operator H, called the Hamiltonian

of the system S in the frame I and corresponding to the observable of the total
mechanical energy of S in the frame I , such that
(i) σ(H) is lower bounded,
(ii) setting Uτ := e−iτ
ℏH, if the system’s state at time t is ρt ∈S(HS), then the
state at time t + τ is:
ρt+τ = γ (H)
τ
(ρt) := UτρtU −1
τ
.
(13.1)
The strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group R ∋τ →Uτ is called time-
evolution operator of S in the frame I , and the continuous projective representa-
tion R ∋τ →γ (H)
τ
of R induced by U is called dynamical ﬂow of S in the frame I .
Remarks 13.1 (1) From now on, unless strictly necessary for better physical clarity,
we will omit to write ℏexplicitly in formulas, and set ℏ= 1.
(2) The evolution of states is therefore given by a continuous projective representation
of the Abelian group R. This fact enables us to phrase differently axiom A6, using the
results of the preceding chapter. With the intent to weaken the axiom’s assumptions
as much as possible, and think of the evolution as a function ρ →γτ(ρ) mapping
states to states for any τ ∈R, we may require γτ to satisfy the following conditions,
all rather reasonable from the physical viewpoint:
(i) γτ preserves the convexity of the space of states (Kadison symmetry), or equiv-
alently, it preserves transition probabilities (Wigner symmetry);
(ii) γτ is additive: γτ ◦γτ ′ = γτ+τ ′, for τ, τ ′ ∈R,
(iii) (viewing symmetries γτ à la Wigner) γτ is continuous for Deﬁnition12.40 or
equivalently, continuous in the topology of Sp(HS) induced by || ||1, as in (12.50).
Then Theorem12.45 proves that the projective representation R ∋τ →γτ has the
form predicted by axiom A6. One of the possible self-adjoint generators – which exist
and differ by an additive constant, by Theorem12.45 – is the system’s Hamiltonian,
by deﬁnition. But we still need to impose the spectrum be bounded from below. In
deﬁning the Hamiltonian, the ambiguity coming from the additive constant is actu-
ally present in physics, because the energy of a classical system (non-relativistic) is
given up to constant. (As classical physics arises as an approximation of relativistic
physics [AnMo12], however, the picture is not so obvious because one must account
for the superselection of the mass, or the like.)
(3) That the Hamiltonian spectrum of a real physical systems is bounded stems from
thermodynamical stability. Unless we consider an ideal system – perfectly isolated
from the environment, which in reality does not exist (also by deep theoretical moti-
vations that demand Quantum Field Theory to be explained properly) – the lower
limit constraining the spectrum of H (the mechanical energy) is unavoidable. In
absence of a threshold there could be transitions to states with decreasingly lower
energy. This (inﬁnite!) energy loss towards the outside, in some form or other (parti-
cles, electromagnetic waves), would in practice make the system collapse. The lower
limit of σ(H) has other important theoretical repercussions we will see later.
(4) The inverse symmetry to time evolution is called time displacement. We met
this symmetry when we were studying the Galilean group. Physically it is an

active transformation of S. In other words, for given τ, it is a Kadison symme-
try γ (−H)
τ
: S(HS) →S(HS) that transforms the state ρ at a generic given time
t0 into the state ττ(ρ) at the same time t0, so that γ (H)

ρ. By construction γ (−H)

τ
is
−H, as the name already suggests. This explains the “−” sign used for the self-
adjoint generator of the time displacement symmetry when we were discussing the
subgroups of the Galilean group in Sect.12.3.3 interpreted as active transformations
of the physical system.
(5) The use of an inertial reference frame is not strictly necessary, and a reference
frame with temporal homogeneity is in fact sufﬁcient for the physical validity of
all statements up to Sect.13.1.6. In that section we shall address what happens in
absence of time homogeneity.
■
Now let us suppose HS is decomposed in coherent sectors HSk, k ∈K, because
Abelian superselection rules occur. Then the space of admissible pure states splits
in the disjoint union of sets Sp(HSk), and mixed states are convex combinations
of elements in the various S(HSk). The next result shows that the dynamical ﬂow
preserves this splitting, as expected.
Proposition 13.2 Let S be a quantum system described on the Hilbert space HS
associated to the inertial frame I , with dynamical ﬂow γ (H). Suppose HS splits
in coherent sectors HSk, k ∈K. Then the dynamical ﬂow preserves both pure and
mixed states. More precisely:
(a) if ρ ∈S(HSk) for some k ∈K, then γ (H)
t
(ρ) ∈S(HSk) for every t ∈R;
(b) if ρ ∈Sp(HSk) for some k ∈K, then γ (H)
t
(ρ) ∈Sp(HSk) for every t ∈R.
Proof Since
γ (H)
t
(ψ(ψ| )) = e−it Hψ

e−it Hψ
 
,
clearly the representation γ (H) maps pure states to pure states, so mixed to mixed
ones. Restrict γ (H) to pure states. Fix ρ ∈Sp(HSk) and consider the path R ∋t →
γ (H)
t
(ρ). By Proposition12.43 it is continuous for || · ||1. We know Sp(HSk) are the
connected components of Sp(HS)adm for the topology induced by the aforemen-
tioned norm (Exercise12.6), so the curve is conﬁned to live in one component only.
The latter is Sp(HSk), since the path passes through there at t = 0. If Ut = e−it H,
then, for any unit vector ψ ∈HSk we have Utψ ∈HSk for all t. Consider now
ρ ∈S(HSk) and its spectral decomposition ρ = 
j∈J p jψ j(ψ j| ). The series con-
verges strongly and by construction ψ j ∈HSk, j ∈J, is a unit vector. Therefore for
any t ∈R:

Remark 13.3 From now on the system’s Hilbert space HS will not contain coherent
sectors, apart from a few cases we will comment upon. We leave it to the reader to
generalise the ensuing deﬁnitions and results to the multi-sector case.
■
13.1.2
Dynamical Symmetries
Time evolution allows to reﬁne the notion of symmetry seen in the previous chapter,
and deﬁne dynamical symmetries.
Consider a quantum system S with dynamical ﬂow γ (H). Let us assume, as we
said, the Hilbert space consists of a single coherent sector. Take a symmetry σ
(Kadison or Wigner) acting on states, paying attention that now states evolve in time
following the dynamics of the ﬂow γ (H). If we apply σ to the evolved state γ (H)
t
(ρ)
and obtain ρ′
t := σ(γ (H)
t
(ρ)), nothing guarantees that the function R ∋t →ρ′
t
will describe the possible evolution under γ (H) of a certain state (necessarily ρ′
0 =
σ(γ (H)
0
(ρ)) = σ(ρ)). But if this does happen (for any choice of initial state ρ), σ
is called a dynamical symmetry, because its action is compatible with the system’s
dynamics.
A variant to having R ∋t →σ(γ (H)
t
(ρ)) describing the evolution of a state in S,
is to take a whole family of symmetries σ (t) parametrised by time t ∈R. To have a
time-dependent dynamical symmetry we require R ∋t →σ (t)(γ (H)
t
(ρ)) still be an
evolution under γ (H) for some state of S.
More formally:
Deﬁnition 13.4 Let S be a quantum system described on the Hilbert space HS (made
of one sector) and associated to the inertial frame I , with Hamiltonian H and
dynamical ﬂow γ (H). A symmetry σ : S(HS) →S(HS) is called a dynamical
symmetry of S if
γ (H)
t
◦σ = σ ◦γ (H)
t
for every t ∈R.
(13.2)
A family of symmetries parametrised by time {σ (t)}t∈R is a time-dependent dynam-
ical symmetry when:
γ (H)
t
◦σ (0) = σ (t) ◦γ (H)
t
for every t ∈R.
(13.3)
The ﬁrst result we prove characterises dynamical symmetries. Part (c) is a conse-
quence of the spectral lower bound of H and characterises dynamical symmetries
when σ(H) is unbounded, as for the majority of concrete physical systems.

Theorem 13.5 Let S be a quantum system described on the Hilbert space HS asso-
ciated to the inertial frame I with Hamiltonian H (hence, with lower-bounded
spectrum) and dynamical ﬂow γ (H).
(a) Consider a family of symmetries labelled by time {σ (t)}t∈R and induced by
unitary (or anti-unitary) operators V (σ (t)) : HS →HS. Then {σ (t)}t∈R is a time-
dependent dynamical symmetry of S if and only if
χtV (σ (t))e−it H = e−it H V (σ (0))
f or every t ∈R and some unit number χt ∈C
(b) Consider a symmetry σ induced by a unitary (or anti-unitary) V (σ) : HS →
HS. Then σ is a dynamical symmetry of S if and only if
e−iatV (σ)e−it H = e−it H V (σ) for every t ∈R and some a ∈R
where a = 0 in the unitary case.
(c) Consider a symmetry σ induced by a unitary (or anti-unitary) operator V (σ) :
HS →HS and suppose σ(H) is not bounded above (but is bounded below). Then σ
is a dynamical symmetry of S if and only if
V (σ)e−it H = e−it H V (σ) for every t ∈R,
or equivalently, if and only if the following hold:
(i) V (σ) is unitary and
(ii) V (σ)H = HV (σ).
Proof (a) and (b). For S : HS →HS unitary (or anti-unitary), Sψ(ψ|S−1·) =
Sψ(Sψ|·). Set Ut := e−it H, V (t) := V (σ (t)) and use the identity with the unitary
operator S := (V (t)Ut)−1UtV (0). Then (13.3) implies, for any pure ρ = ψ(ψ| ):
(V (t)Ut)−1UtV (0)ψ

(V (t)Ut)−1UtV (0)ψ
 
= ψ(ψ| ) ,
hence for some unit number χt ∈C:
(V (t)Ut)−1UtV (0)ψ = χtψ
for all ψ ∈H.
The same proof of the analogous fact in Theorem12.11 says that χt does not depend
on ψ. Therefore if σ (t) is a time-dependent dynamical symmetry:
χtV (σ (t))Ut = UtV (σ (0))
for all t ∈R and some χt ∈C, |χt| = 1.
Conversely, if the condition holds, trivially σ (t) is a time-dependent dynamical sym-
metry. Statement (b) is a subcase, except for the proof that χt = eict for some c ∈R,
which we will settle at the end.
(c) We claim that if σ is a dynamical symmetry then (i), (ii) hold. By (a), if σ is
a dynamical symmetry:

13.1 Quantum Dynamics and Its Symmetries
799
χtV (σ)Ut = UtV (σ)
for some unit χt ∈C
(13.4)
Hence χt I = (V (σ)Ut)−1UtV (σ) and χt(φ|ψ) =

V (σ)Utφ
UtV (σ)ψ

if V (σ) is
unitary, or χt(ψ|φ) =

V (σ)Utφ
 UtV (σ)ψ

if V (σ) is anti-unitary. Choose φ ∈
D(H) not orthogonal to ψ ∈V (σ)−1(D(H)) (since D(H) is dense), apply Stone’s
theorem and conclude t →χt is smooth everywhere. We rewrite (13.4) as:
χtUt = e±itV (σ)−1HV σ ,
(13.5)
with ‘−’ sign if V (σ) is unitary, ‘+’ if anti-unitary (in the latter case the ﬁnal χt coin-
cides with the initial χt). Using Stone’s theorem in (13.5) we obtain D(V (σ)−1HV (σ))
⊂D(H) = D(cI + H) and
∓V (σ)−1HV (σ)↾D(H)= cI + H
where c:= i dχt
dt |t=0.
(13.6)
Note c must be real since ∓V (σ)−1HV (σ) −H is symmetric on D(H). Actually
(13.6) holds on the entire domain of V (σ)−1HV (σ) because the latter is self-adjoint
and does not have self-adjoint extensions (cI + H) other than ∓V (σ)−1HV (σ) itself.
Therefore
V (σ)−1HV (σ) = ∓cI ∓H .
(13.7)
In particular (cf. Exercise12.8 in the anti-unitary case):
σ(H) = σ(V (σ)−1HV (σ)) = σ (∓cI ∓H) = ∓c ∓σ(H) .
If σ(H) is bounded below but not above, the identity cannot be valid if on the
right side we have the minus sign, irrespective of the constant c. Hence V (σ) must
be unitary. Therefore infσ(H) = inf(c + σ(H)) = c + infσ(H) and c = 0, for
infσ(H) is ﬁnite by hypothesis (σ(H) ̸= ∅is bounded below). We obtained that a
dynamical symmetry σ fulﬁls (i) and (ii): V (σ) is unitary and V (σ)H = HV (σ). If
so, H = V (σ)−1HV (σ). Exponentiating,
V (σ)e−it H = e−it H V (σ)
for every t ∈R,
eventually showing that σ is a dynamical symmetry, and ending part (c).
We still have to ﬁnish part (b). If σ is a symmetry, using the proof of (c) we
arrive at (13.7). Yet we cannot say c = 0, unless V (σ) is unitary, for in that case
σ(H) = c + σ(H) and the reasoning still works. Exponentiating (13.7) gives:
e−ictUt = V (σ)−1UtV (σ) ,
whence
e−iatV (σ)e−it H = e−it H V (σ)
where a = −c if V (σ) anti-unitary. This ends part (b) and the proof.

Schrödinger’s Equation and Stationary States
Consider a pure initial state ρ ∈Sp(HS). As already noticed, the evolution is such
that any evolved state ρt is pure. Theoretical physicists refer to this property1 by
saying that the evolution of quantum states is unitary. If t →ρt ∈Sp(HS) denotes
the evolution of a pure state, we can determine any ρt, up to phase, by a vector
ψt normalised to 1. Choosing the simplest phases for the pure states involved,
the equation governing the evolution of pure states becomes (reintroducing the
constant ℏ):
ψt′ = e−i(t′−t)
ℏ
Hψt .
(13.8)
We can manipulate this relation to obtain an equation of great historical relevance.
For this we observe that ψt ∈D(H) implies ψt′ ∈D(H) for any other time t′ ∈R. In
fact, ψt ∈D(H) means

R λ2dμ(H)
ψt
< +∞, where μ(H)
ψt (E) = (ψt|P(H)(E)ψt) =
(ψt′|e+ iτ
ℏH P(H)(E)e−iτ
ℏHψt′), for t −t′ = τ. On the other hand, trivially,
e+ iτ
ℏH P(H)(E)e−iτ
ℏH = P(H)(E) ,
since P(H)(E) is a projector of the PVM of H. Hence

R λ2dμ(H)
ψt
< +∞is equiv-
alent to

R λ2dμ(H)
ψt′ < +∞, i.e. ψt′ ∈D(H). Let us suppose ψt ∈D(H) for some
t, from which ψt′ ∈D(H) for every t′. Applying Stone’s theorem to (13.8) and
interpreting the resulting derivative in strong sense, we obtain
iℏd
dt ψt = Hψt .
(13.9)
This is the fundamental time-dependent Schrödinger equation. We have to notice
that (13.9) only holds if ψt ∈D(H), whereas the evolution Eq.(13.1) has a general
reach.
Let us make a few comments on Schrödinger’s equation and then pass to more
general matters.
Consider a system formed by one particle of mass m (without spin for simplic-
ity) subjected to a force with sufﬁciently regular potential energy V = V (x), in the
inertial frame I with right-handed orthonormal coordinates. Following the discus-
sion about Dirac’s correspondence principle, at the end of Chap.11, one expects the
Hamiltonian of this system to correspond, quantum-wise, to a certain self-adjoint
extension H of the symmetric operator
H0:= 1

initially deﬁned on some invariant dense subspace where Pi and Xi are well deﬁned.
This choice formally fulﬁls Dirac’s correspondence, at least with reference to the
commutation relations of H0 and Xk, Pk on domains where everything is well deﬁned.
This expectation turns out to be correct, and the Hamiltonian observables do have
the mentioned form in the physical world. Systems formed by atoms and molecules,
for instance, behave like that [Mes99, CCP82].
We shall identify the particle’s Hilbert space with L2(R3, dx) so that position
operators are multiplicative. If we work with functions that are regular enough, the
starting expression for H is
H0 = −ℏ2
2m Δ + V (X) ,
(13.10)
where Δ is the familiar Laplacian on R3 and V (X) is the multiplication by the original
function V = V (x). Schrödinger’s equation then reads:

−ℏ2
2m Δ + V (X)
	
ψt(x) = iℏ∂
∂t ψt(x) ,
which is precisely how Schrödinger wrote it in his astounding 1926 papers. Beware,
however, that the equation should not be taken literally, as a usual PDE, because:
(1) the t-derivative is not meant pointwise, but in Hilbert sense2; (2) the equation is
valid up to zero-measure sets for x, since wavefunctions belong to L2(R3, dx). If we
were to ﬁnd “naïve” solutions (functions f (t, x) in t and x), we would then have to
prove they solve (13.9) in the unknown ψt = f (t, ·) ∈L2(R3, dx).
Let us return to how to deﬁne the Hamiltonian operator from the symmetric
differential operator (13.10) deﬁned on a dense domain. We have to verify, case
by case, if the operator admits self-adjoint extensions or if it is essentially self-
adjoint. In this respect the symmetric operator H0 commutes with the operator C :
L2(R3, dx) →L2(R3, dx) representing the complex conjugation of L2 functions.
By von Neumann’s theorem5.43, then, there are self-adjoint extensions. The general
theory of self-adjoint extensions of operators like H0 was developed and harvested
by T. Kato [Kat66]. For several potentials of interest, like the attractive Coulomb
potential and the harmonic oscillator, one can prove H0 is essentially self-adjoint. We
saw these results in Examples10.52, Sect.10.4, as consequences of general theorems.
There is a whole branch of functional analysis in Hilbert spaces devoted to this sort
of problems. We mention just one easy corollary of Theorem10.50.
Theorem 13.6 (Kato) Consider the differential operator on R3:
H0:= −ℏ2
2m Δ + V (x) ,
(13.11)
2Observe, nevertheless, that if the derivative exists both in the ordinary and in the L2 sense, the two
coincide by Proposition2.32 for p = 2.

deﬁned on some dense domain D(H0) ⊃S (R3). Suppose
V (x) =
N

j=1
g j
|x −x j| + U(x) ,
(13.12)
where g j are constants, x j ∈R3 are given points and U : R3 →R is measurable
and (essentially) bounded. Then
(a) H0 is essentially self-adjoint on D(H0), D(R3) and S (R3).
(b) The common self-adjoint extension H0 of the operators in (a) coincides with the
self-adjoint operator −Δ + V deﬁned on D(−Δ).
(c) σ(H0) is bounded from below.
In general, if the Hamiltonian H of a certain system has point spectrum σp(H), every
eigenvector ψE of H, for E ∈σp(H), has a trivial evolution:
UtψE = e−i t E
ℏψE .
This says the pure state ρE := ψE(ψE| ) associated to ψE (||ψE|| = 1) does not
evolve in time. These very special states are called stationary states of the system.
When one studies the macroscopic system of an atom or a molecule, the starting
point is describe the heavier parts – nuclei – as classical systems, that act by electric
Coulomb forces on peripheral electrons viewed as quantum particles. The electrons’
quantum states are stationary for their Hamiltonian. More on this in Example13.8(3).
Remarks 13.7 (1) Referring to Theorem13.6 it can be proved (cf. [CCP82, Sect.VI]
and especially [Hel64, Sect.11]) that if some g j vanish and the remaining are strictly
negative then σp(H0) ̸= ∅.
(2) By virtue of Theorem10.51, H0 continues to be essentially self-adjoint on D(R3)
and the only self-adjoint extension is bounded from below providedU is non-negative
and lower bounded. In that case [CCP82, Hel64], if g j = 0 for every j and U is
regular enough and tends to inﬁnity as |x| →+∞, then σ(H0) = σp(H0) ̸= ∅.
(3) One of the highest mountain tops the inexperienced student has to conquer when
taking on QM is to understand the motivations behind the regularity constraints
imposed on the eigenvalues of the theory’s Hamiltonian. The characteristic equation
H0ψE = EψE ,
with E ∈R ,
ψE ∈L2(R3, dx) ,
should give, roughly speaking, the stationary states of the system whose Hamiltonian
is determined by H0. Consider, as often in physics, an operator of the form (13.11)
where the function U : R3 →R of (13.12) has ﬁnite discontinuities on some
regular surfaces σk, k = 1, 2, . . . , N (disjoint from one another and from other
isolated singularities of V ) and is continuous everywhere else. We also want U to
be bounded (by remark (2) we could just require lower boundedness). QM manuals
typically require the functions ψE further satisfy the following conditions:
(1) away from the singularities of V the ψE are C2 (actually C∞),

13.1 Quantum Dynamics and Its Symmetries
803
(2) the ψE solve H0ψE = EψE for some E ∈R, i.e. interpreting the operator as
if it were a differential operator, away from the singularities of V ,
(3) on singular surfaces σk the maps ψE and the normal derivatives are continuous,
(4) at isolated singularities ψE admits ﬁnite limits.
The constraints are sometimes justiﬁed in a sort-of-whimsical way in textbooks (this
happens in particular for the analogous statements for R1).
What we can say is, ﬁrst, that H0 is not the operator representing the Hamiltonian
observable, because H0 is not self-adjoint! The operator in question is a self-adjoint
extension of H0. Theorem13.6 warrants, under the assumptions made, H0 is essen-
tially self-adjoint on D(R3), so there is one self-adjoint extension that coincides with
the closure of H0 and with its adjoint as well: H0 = H ∗
0 . Stationary states are given
by the spectrum of H ∗
0 , i.e. by solutions to
H ∗
0 ψE = EψE ,
E ∈R ,
ψE ∈D(H ∗
0 ) .
This equation, since D(R3) is dense in L2(R3, dx), may be written:
(ϕ|H ∗
0 ψE) = E(ϕ|ψE),
E ∈R,
for every ϕ ∈D(R3) and a given ψE ∈D(H ∗
0 ).
Using the deﬁnition of adjoint, the equation reads
(H0ϕ|ψE) = E(ϕ|ψE) ,
E ∈R ,
for any ϕ ∈D(R3) and a given ψE ∈D(H ∗
0 ).
Put differently, we seek functions ψE ∈L2(R3, dx) such that, for any ϕ ∈D(R3):

R3

−ℏ2
2m Δϕ(x) + V (x)ϕ(x) −Eϕ(x)

ψE(x) dx = 0 .
(13.13)
Hence the ψE do not necessarily solve H ∗
0 ψE = EψE, for it is enough they solve it
weakly: they must satisfy (13.13) for any ϕ ∈D(R3). Issues of this kind [ReSi80]
are dealt with by the general theory of elliptic regularity, which proves [CCP82,
Hel64] ψE ∈L2(R3, dx) satisﬁes (13.13), with the aforementioned assumptions on
the potential V , if and only if ψE satisﬁes conditions (1)–(4).

Let us brieﬂy discuss its self-adjointness. Although everything should be clear from

Pk↾2
S (R3)= −ℏ2

is essentially self-adjoint. The proof is direct via the unitary Fourier-Plancherel oper-
ator 
F, noting that in the space L2(R3, dk) of transformed maps 
ψ := 
F(ψ), the
above operator multiplies by:
k →ℏ2
2m k2 ,
and has dense domain D( 
F −1H0 
F) := S (R3). By construction 
F −1H0 
F is
symmetric, and it is easy to prove its essential self-adjointness by showing
Ker(( 
F −1H0 
F)∗± i I) = {0} ,
or by proving that each vector of D(R3) ⊂S (R3) is analytic for 
F −1H0 
F. The
same holds for H0, since 
F is unitary.
By construction if H := H0, then 
H :=

However, H0 is still essentially self-adjoint and its self-adjoint extension is the pre-
vious H. Or, we could deﬁne H0 on 
F(D(R3)), and ﬁnd the same result. All this
descends from Proposition10.45.

where e < 0, Q > 0 are constants expressing the electric charges of the particle
and the centre of attraction respectively. The assumptions of Kato’s theorem10.50
(or 10.48) hold (m, ℏ> 0 are constants that play no role, since we can multiply the
operator by 2m/ℏ2 without loss of generality). Therefore:
H0 := −ℏ2
2m Δ + V (x)
is essentially self-adjoint, whether deﬁned on D(R3) or S (R3). If −Q = e is the
charge of the electron (−1.60 · 10−19 C), and m = me its mass (9.11 · 10−31 Kg), the
only self-adjoint extension H0 corresponds to the Hamiltonian of an electron inside
the electric ﬁeld of a proton (neglecting spin effects and envisaging the proton as
a classical object of inﬁnite mass). This gives the simplest quantum description of
the Hamiltonian operator of the hydrogen atom. Although V is not bounded from
below, it is important to note the spectrum of the operator is always bounded, so also
the admissible values of energy are constrained. This implies the hydrogen atom
is an energetically stable system: it cannot collapse under an inﬁnite energy loss
caused by the interaction with the electromagnetic ﬁeld (i.e. losing the energy of
photons emitted by the atom: this way will not be treated in this physically-very-
elementary book). The analogous classical model, for which the electron and the
attractive centre are dimensionless points, would not have total energy bounded from
below.3 Studying the spectrum of H0 [Mes99, CCP82] shows σc(H0) = [0, +∞),

By examining the interaction between photons and the hydrogen atom [Mes99,
CCP82] we know that the electron, initially in a stationary state determined by an
eigenvector of H0 with eigenvalue En, can change state and pass to a new stationary
state of energy Em < En transferring the excess of energy to a photon. The reverse
process may occur, whereby the electron acquires energy from a photon and passes
from a state of energy Em to a state of energy En. Due to the interactions with
photons, it can be proved that only the state of minimum energy E1 = 2π Rℏc,
the so-called ground state, is stable, while the others are all unstable. The electron
decays to the ground state after a certain mean lifetime to be determined. (Therefore
the name stationary state is not completely appropriate for the system formed by
an atom and the electromagnetic ﬁeld described by photons. One should rather just
speak of eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom.) The collection
of energy differences En −Em determine all possible photonic frequencies (light
frequencies) that a gas of hydrogen atoms can emit or absorb, by Einstein’s formula
En−Em = hνn,m. The latter relates the frequency νn,m of photons emitted by the atom
to the energy needed by photons that switch from energy En to Em (see Chap.6). XIX
century spectroscopists, though puzzled by the values νn,m, knew them long before
QM was formulated [Mes99, CCP82]. Finding the same values and being able to
explain them in a completely theoretical manner is certainly one of the pinnacles of
physics in the past century.
(3) A second interesting situation, in R3, is that in which to the Hamiltonian of the
free particle of example (1) we add the Yukawa potential:
V (x) = −e−μ|x|
|x|
,
where μ > 0 is a positive constant. Here, too, H0 = −ℏ2
2m Δ+V (x) is essentially self-
adjoint if either deﬁned on D(R3) or on S (R3), because of Kato’s theorem10.50 (or
10.48). The Yukawa potential describes, roughly speaking, the interaction processes
between a pion and the strong force originating from a macroscopic source.
(4) Still referring to example (1), the action of the evolution operator is evident using
the Fourier representation:

for ψ ∈S (R3). In general the integrals should be understood in the sense of the
Fourier-Plancherel transform.
(5) In the previous example Eq.(13.18) can be written without Fourier-transforming
the initial datum ψ, as this proposition establishes.
Proposition 13.9 Take ψ ∈S (R3) and H = −ℏ

ψ of ψ ∈S (R3) is in S (R3). Multiplying by the
exponential e−iℏk2/(2m) produces a map of S (R3). Since S (R3) is Fourier-invariant,
Eq.(13.18) implies ψ(t, ·) ∈S (R3).

For t ̸= 0 and x ∈R3 ﬁxed, we can take the limit inside the integral due to
dominated convergence: the integrand, in fact, is in absolute value smaller than
|ψ| ∈L1(R3, dx), uniformly in ϵ > 0. This gives (13.20).
(c) Follows from (b) directly.
□
Equation(13.20) holds on Rd if we replace the exponent 3/2 with d/2. (The wave-
functions ψ(t, x), x ∈Rd, evolve under the evolution operator generated by the
self-adjoint closure of −1
2m Δ, where Δ : S (Rd) →L2(Rd, dx) is the Laplacian in
d dimensions.)
Since the integral of |ψ(t, x)|2 over R3 is constant in time, and |ψ(t, x)|2 at any
point x ∈R3 is inﬁnitesimal by (13.21), a wavefunction that is initially non-zero on
a small region in space must increase its support as time goes by, and “spread out”
over increasingly larger regions.

The Action of the Galilean Group in Position
Representation
Example13.8(4) allows to make explicit, in position representation, the Galilean
group’s action, which we saw at the end of Chap.12 in momentum representation
for the free particle of spin s. If (τ, c, v,U) is the generic element of the universal
covering 
SG of the restricted Galilean group, the aforementioned representation is
induced by the unitary operators Z(m)
(τ,c,v,U) that act, in momentum representation, as

for ψ ∈L2(R2, dx). Put otherwise, if ψ′(t, x) :=


(x) is the wave-
function acted upon by the element (τ, c, v,U) of the (universal covering of the)
Galilean group at t = 0, which evolves to time t, we have:


(τ, c, v, U)−1(t, x)

(13.22)
by (12.138). For particles with spin s, as we saw in the previous chapter, for ﬁxed
inertial frame the Hilbert space is L2(R3, dx) ⊗C2s+1 and wavefunctions are unit
vectors
Ψ =
s

sz=−s
ψsz ⊗|s, sz⟩,
where |s, sz⟩form the canonical basis of C2s+1 in which the spin operator Sz is
diagonal with eigenvalues sz.
By this decomposition L2(R3, dx) ⊗C2s+1 becomes naturally isomorphic to the
orthogonal sum of 2s + 1 copies of L2(R3, dx). Consequently, the vectors Ψ deﬁne
spinors of order s, that is, column vectors of wavefunctions for particles without
spin:
Ψ ≡(ψs, ψs−1, · · · , ψ−s+1, ψ−s)t .
Similarly, let Ψ ′
t :=

Ut Z(m)
(τ,c,v,U) ⊗V (s)(U)Ψ

, where V (s)(U) is the action of
U ∈SU(2) on spinors for particles of spin s (cf. Sect.12.3.1). Then the active
Galilean action, in terms of spinors, reads:
ψ′
s′z(t, x) = eim(v·x−v2t/2)

(13.23)
where V (s)(U)i j is the matrix entry of V (s)(U) in the canonical basis of C2s+1.
Now think of Galilean transformations passively, hence view the Z(m)
(τ,c,v,U) as uni-
tary operators between distinct Hilbert spaces associated to different frame systems
that describe the same physical system. We can thus describe the transformations
of quantum states between different frame systems. The basic idea is that when one
acts on a state by an active Galilean transformation, and then changes to the trans-
formed reference system by the same active map, in the new frame the transformed
state must look like the original, pre-transformation, one. Therefore the law of pas-
sive transformations of states (coordinate change) corresponds to the inverse active
transformation seen above, meaning that we replace (τ, c, v, U) with (τ, c, v, U)−1
in (13.23). Let us see this recipe implemented. Take two inertial frames I , I ′ with
right-handed Cartesian coordinates x1, x2, x3 and x′
1, x′
2, x′
3 and time coordinate t, t′
respectively. Suppose the coordinate change is the Galilean transformation:

Hilbert space is H := L2(R3, dx)⊗C2s+1 for I , and H′ := L2(R′3, dx′)⊗C2s+1′ for
I ′. The spaces R3 and R′3 are identiﬁed with the rest spaces of their frame systems
by the coordinates. The canonical bases of C2s+1, C2s+1′ are the eigenvector bases
of the spin operators along the third axes, S3 and S3′. Choose a matrix U ∈SU(2)
whose image under the covering of SO(3) is R. (Note the parameters v, U also show
up in the phase factor, and are given up to sign, as seen in the previous chapter: this
sign may change the vectors representing a pure state, but does not alter the state
itself.) Consider a pure state described in I by the unit vector Ψ and its evolution
in I . The state Ψ corresponds to a state Ψ ′ in I ′, together with its evolution. The

appear in the phase, and the ones of the inverse Galilean transformation must be
used). For spin s = 0, in particular:
ψ′(t′, x′) = e−im(v·R(U)x+v2t′/2)ψ (t + τ, R(U)x + τv + c) ,
(13.26)
where the coordinates (t, x) and (t′, x′) are related by (13.24).
Remark 13.10 Notice how the term e−im(v·R(U)x+v2t/2) cannot be removed by taking
another representative for the projective ray, since the phase depends on the vari-
able x. The resulting equation, therefore, is not the transformation we would expect
intuitively, if we imagine that the spinless wavefunction and each component of
the wavefunction with spin s ̸= 0 are scalar ﬁelds on the spacetime of classical
physics. The scalar-ﬁeld interpretation of wavefunctions in position representation
is a priori not automatic, and totally false (not just for one choice of phase) in rela-
tivistic theories, where wavefunctions in position representation (within the so-called
Newton-Wigner formalism [Var07]) are highly nonlocal objects.4
■
4One should not confuse a wavefunction in position representation with the ﬁeld of second quanti-
sation, which is a local object instead.

Basic Notions of Scattering Processes
Consider a quantum system, for instance a single quantum particle, described on the
Hilbert space H (after an inertial system has been ﬁxed) and whose evolution is given
by a Hamiltonian operator H = H0 + V . The term H0 is the Hamiltonian of the
“non-interacting theory” that we may think, to ﬁx ideas, as described by the purely
kinetic Hamiltonian of the particle, even if we could consider more involved multi-
particle quantum systems. The other term V represents therefore the interaction with
an external ﬁeld or the self-interaction, and is often unknown or partially known. In
certain circumstances, in the distant past or future a state described by ψ behaves
“as if it evolved” under the non-interacting Hamiltonian H0. This happens typically
in scattering processes.
Consider for example one particle: initially free, it interacts brieﬂy with a scat-
tering centre – a system we can treat as semi-classical – and then becomes again
free. Experimentally speaking, we can say the system is prepared at t →−∞in an
approximatively free state, and after the interaction, as t →+∞, it manifests itself
in a state that can still be seen as free. Examining the difference between prepared
state and observed state gives informations on the structure of the scattering centre,
and more generally on the type of interaction described by V . In more complicated
situations there is no scattering centre, and one has to deal with two or more particles,
or even systems with an unknown number of particles that (self-)interact very brieﬂy
and return swiftly to a non-interacting setup.
We will introduce the basic mathematical ideas to formalise all that, referring
the reader to advanced texts [ReSi80, Pru81, Mes99, CCP82] for details and gen-
eralisations to several particles (or relativistic processes with unknown number of
particles).
The fact that for certain state vectors in the system, generically indicated by φ, the
evolution in time is approximated by the non-interacting evolution in the far future,
is expressed by
lim
t→+∞||e−it Hφ −e−it H0ψ|| = 0 .
(13.27)
for some state ψ distinct from, but determined by, φ. Equivalently, since eit H is
unitary:
lim
t→+∞||φ −eit He−it H0ψ|| = 0 .
(13.28)
The argument can be clearly replicated for t →−∞, to describe what happens long
before the interaction takes place, when the evolution is taken to be free. For several
reasons, both theoretical and experimental, it is convenient to describe scattering
using vectors like ψ, that evolve by the Hamiltonian of the non-interacting theory,
rather than φ, which evolves under the interacting Hamiltonian. This motivates the
introduction of wave operators Ω±, also known as Møller operators:
Ω±ψ := lim
t→±∞eit He−it H0ψ ,
ψ ∈H,
(13.29)

812
13
Selected Advanced Topics in Quantum Mechanics
assuming the limit exists.
If the operators Ω± : H →H exist they must be isometries, since they are strong
limits of unitary operators. More precisely Ω± are partial isometries (Deﬁnition3.72)
with initial space the whole H. Consequently the ﬁnal spaces
H± := Ran(Ω±)
(13.30)
are closed in H by Proposition3.73. By construction if φ± ∈H±, so φ± = Ω±ψ for
some ψ ∈H, it follows5
||e−it Hφ± −e−it H0ψ|| →0 as t →±∞.
(13.31)
Hence H± determine the class of states whose long-time future evolution, or long-
time past evolution, can be approximated by the free evolution of the states obtained
by swapping the Ω±. Equation(13.31), exactly as we wanted, tells that the state of
the interacting system φ±, evolving under the full Hamiltonian H = H0 + V , has
the asymptotic behaviour (as t →±∞, respectively) of the state ψ in the non-
interacting system, which evolves under the free Hamiltonian H0.
In detail:
Proposition 13.11 If the surjective isometry Ω± : H →H± of (13.29) is deﬁned,
then
e−it HΩ± = Ω±e−it H0 .
(13.32)
Consequently
e−it HH± ⊂H±,
e−it H↾H±= Ω±e−it H0Ω−1
± ,
H↾H±∩D(H)= Ω±H0Ω−1
± , (13.33)
and in particular:
σ(H↾H±∩D(H)) = σ(H0) .
(13.34)
Proof As for the ﬁrst statement
e−it HΩ±ψ = lim
s→±∞ei(s−t)He−isH0ψ = lim
z→±∞eizHe−izH0e−it H0ψ = Ω±e−it H0ψ ,
whence e−it HH± ⊂H± and e−it H ↾H±= Ω±e−it H0Ω−1
± . Stone’s theorem easily
implies the other relation. Eventually, Ω± : H →H± being isometric proves (13.34)
by the last identity in (13.33) (Exercise8.9).
□
For the usual non-relativistic particle the non-interacting Hamiltonian H0, that
accounts for the kinetic energy only, has spectrum σ(H0) = σc(H0) = [0, +∞).
Under the above proposition’s assumptions, then, σ(H↾H±∩D(H)) = σc(H↾H±∩D(H)
) = [0 + ∞).
5In fact ||e−it HΩ±ψ−e−it H0ψ|| = ||Ω±ψ−eit He−it H0ψ|| →||Ω±ψ−Ω±ψ|| = 0 as t →±∞.

13.1 Quantum Dynamics and Its Symmetries
813
So let us assume the wave operators Ω± : H →H± do exist on some physical
system, and suppose the system has been prepared in a state that, as t →−∞, tends
to be described by the non-interacting evolution of e−it H0ψin. Hence the system’s
real state will be described, at t = 0, by the state φ−:= Ω−ψin. After the interaction,
as t →+∞, the state will be described approximatively by a non-interacting vector
e−it H0ψout. The real state, at t = 0, is described by φ+ := Ω+ψout. The probability
of the process is thus:
|(φ+|φ−)|2 = |(Ω+ψout|Ω−ψin)|2 = |(ψout|Ω∗
+Ω−ψin)|2 .
Deﬁne the scattering operator, also called S matrix:
S := Ω∗
+Ω−: H →H .
(13.35)
Thetransitionamplitudefromastatethatbehavesasanon-interactingstatee−it H0ψin,
as t →−∞, to the state that behaves like a non-interacting state e−it H0ψout as
t →+∞, equals:
(ψout|Sψin) .
(13.36)
In this picture, the interaction V is completely “withheld” by S, while we can consider
the states ψin/out as being indeed free. Overall we have, as we were saying at the
beginning, a recipe to describe the scattering in terms of states in a non-interacting
system. To conclude, we have a proposition.
Proposition 13.12 If the surjective isometries Ω± : H →H± of (13.29) exist, and
H+ = H−(in particular, under asymptotic completeness, see Remark13.13(1)), the
scattering operator (13.35) is unitary.
Proof It is enough to prove S∗S = SS∗= I. Since Ω± is a partial isometry with
initial space H and ﬁnal space H±, by Proposition3.74
Ω∗
±Ω± = I ,
Ω±Ω∗
± = PH± .
where PH± : H →H is the orthogonal projector onto H±. Therefore
S∗S = Ω∗
−Ω+Ω∗
+Ω−= Ω∗
−PH+Ω−= Ω∗
−PH−Ω−= Ω∗
−Ω−= I .
Similarly,
SS∗= Ω∗
+Ω−Ω∗
−Ω+ = Ω∗
+PH−Ω+ = Ω∗
+PH+Ω+ = Ω∗
+Ω+ = I ,
ending the proof.
□
Remarks 13.13 (1) Next to H± it is useful to introduce the space of stationary
states Hp, given by the closure of the span of eigenvectors of H, which describe
stationary states (see Remark9.15(2)). Physically, one expects elements φ ∈Hp to

814

represent precisely states whose evolution cannot be approximated, at large times,
by non-interacting states. That is because the evolution of such a state φ(φ| ) (with
||φ|| = 1) is trivial, for φ is an eigenvector of H. What we expect, said more
accurately, is to have an orthogonal sum
H = H± ⊕Hp .
(13.37)
If this happens one speaks about asymptotic completeness. Note that (13.37)
implies:
H+ = H−= H⊥
p ,
(13.38)
and by (13.34), also
σpc(H) = σ(H0)
(13.39)
(Remark9.15(2)). At last, asymptotic completeness and (13.38) make the operator
S unitary by Proposition13.12.
(2) The next easy result relates the orthogonality of H± and Hp with the properties
of the evolution operator generated by H0.
Proposition 13.14 If the surjective isometry Ω± : H →H± of (13.29) exists, and
(ψ|e−it H0ψ′) →0 as t →±∞for any ψ, ψ′ ∈H, then H± ⊥Hp.
Proof Deﬁne φ± := Ω±ψ and suppose HφE = EφE. Then
(φ±|φE) = lim
t→±∞(eit He−it H0ψ|φE) = lim
t→±∞(e−it H0ψ|eit HφE)
= limt→±∞e−i Et(e−it H0ψ|φE) = 0.
□
(3) The short and compressed description of scattering theory we have presented does
not work in Quantum Field Theory: deﬁning the unitary operators Ω± is not possible
under simple, physically plausible hypotheses on spatial homogeneity (the theory’s
invariance under the group of space translations). The obstruction is exquisitely the-
oretical and goes under the name of Haag theorem [Haa96]. In order to overcome the
problem we can turn to the LSZ formalism [Haa96], in which scattering descriptions
employ the weak topology. However, these issues assume an ivory-tower ﬂavour, so
to speak, when compared to the much more serious problem of renormalisation. ■
Example 13.15 Take a free spinless particle (in the sequel ℏ= 1) of mass m > 0,
subject to a square-integrable potential V on R3 in a given inertial system. Then
H = L2(R3, dx), H0 = −1
2m Δ (the Laplacian Δ is as usual initially deﬁned on
D(R3) or S (R3)), and V ∈L2(R3). Theorem10.48 (redeﬁning the coordinates of
R3 so to comprise the factor (2m)−1) guarantees H = H0 + V is self-adjoint on
D(H0), so D(H) = D(H0).
We wish to show the wave operators Ω± are well deﬁned, and that H± ⊥Hp.
First, a technical lemma.

13.1 Quantum Dynamics and Its Symmetries

Lemma 13.16 If H = L2(R3, dx), H0 = −1
2m Δ and V ∈L2(R3), let H = H0 + V
and U0(t) := e−it H0, U(t) := e−it H. Then
d
dt U(−t)U0(t)ψ = U(−t)iVU0(t)ψ ,
ψ ∈D(H0) = D(H).
(13.40)
Hence, for T > t:
||(U(−T)U0(T ) −U(−t)U0(t))ψ)|| ≤

 T

||VU0(s)ψ||ds ,
(13.41)
Proof Set Ωt := U(−t)U0(t). Then

h
ψ .
Since U0(t)D(H0) ⊂D(H0) = D(H), Stone’s theorem shows the second limit
equals
U(−t)i HU0(t)ψ .
As for the ﬁrst limit, we compute the norm squared of the difference between
−iU(−t)H0U0(t)ψ and U(−(t+h))(U0(t+h)−U0(t))
h
ψ. By Stone’s theorem and the uni-
tarity of U(−(t + h)):
lim
h→0
U(−(t + h))(U0(t + h) −U0(t))
h
ψ = −iU(−t)H0U0(t)ψ .
As H −H0 = V , we have:
d
dt Ωtψ = U(−t)iVU0(t)ψ ,
for ψ ∈D(H0), so for any φ ∈H
d
dt (φ|Ωtψ) = (φ|U(−t)iVU0(t)ψ) .
The right-hand side is continuous, so the fundamental theorem of calculus gives
(φ|ΩT ψ) −(φ|Ωtψ) =

 T

(φ|U(−s)iVU0(s)ψ)ds .

But U(s) is unitary,

||φ||||VU0(s)ψ||ds ,
and choosing φ = (ΩT −Ωt)ψ we recover (13.41):

ending the proof.
□
This lemma allows to prove the existence of wave operators on the system considered.
Proposition 13.17 Take H = L2(R3, dx), H0 = −1
2m Δ, V ∈L2(R3), and consider
the self-adjoint operator H = H0 + V .
(a) The wave operators Ω± : H →H± in (13.29) are well deﬁned.
(b) H± ⊥Hp.
Remark 13.18 The theorem applies to the special case where V is a Yukawa
potential (Example13.8(3)). One can reach a stronger conclusion: by assuming
V ∈L1(R3, dx)∩L2(R3, dx), as for the Yukawa potential, asymptotic completeness
holds, hence the scattering operator is unitary [ReSi80].
■
Proof (a) Let us begin with the existence of Ω+, for Ω−is similar. If ψ ∈S (R3) ⊂
D(H0) = D(H), estimate (13.41) implies immediately:
||(U(−T )U0(T ) −U(−t)U0(t))ψ)|| ≤

 T
t
||V ||2||U0(s)ψ||∞ds
because if ψ ∈S (R3) then U0(t)ψ ∈S (R3) (cf. Example13.8(5)). Using (13.21)
we ﬁnd:
||(U(−T )U0(T )ψ −U(−t)U0(t)ψ)|| ≤2CV,ψ
 1
√|t| −

.
(13.42)
This shows every sequence of vectors ψn := U(−tn)U0(tn)ψ is a Cauchy sequence
when tn →+∞for n →+∞, so it converges to φ ∈H. On the other hand
Eq.(13.42) proves such limit does not depend on the sequence chosen. Hence if
ψ ∈S (R3) there exist a (unique) φ ∈H so that
lim
t→+∞U(−t)U0(t)ψ = φ .
(13.43)
This extends easily to ψ ∈H, because S (R3) is dense in H. Let us prove the
latter assertion. Set Ωt := U(−t)U0(t). By the above considerations Ω′ψ :=
limt→+∞Ωtψ is well deﬁned provided ψ ∈S (R3). Since this space is dense in

13.1 Quantum Dynamics and Its Symmetries
817
H and every Ωt is isometric, the operator Ω′ extends to a linear isometry on H. To
conclude it sufﬁces to prove Ωtψ →Ω′ψ, t →+∞, for any ψ ∈H. If ψ ∈H
consider a sequence {ψn}n∈N ⊂S (R3) with ψn →ψ, n →+∞in H. Then
||Ωtψ −Ω′ψ|| ≤||Ωtψ −Ωtψn|| + ||Ωtψn −Ω′ψn|| + ||Ω′ψn −Ω′ψ|| .
Since Ωt and Ω′ are isometric, we can rewrite it as
||Ωtψ −Ω′ψ|| ≤||ψ −ψn|| + ||Ωtψn −Ω′ψn|| + ||ψn −ψ|| .
Given ϵ > 0, choose n ∈N large enough so that ||ψ −ψn|| < 2ϵ/3. For that n,
by the ﬁrst part of the proof, we can pick T ∈R so that ||Ωtψn −Ω′ψn|| < ϵ/3
for t > T . Hence we can determine, for every ϵ > 0, T ∈R such that t > T gives
||Ωtψ −Ω′ψ|| ≤ϵ. And this holds for any ψ ∈H, ending (a).
(b)Itisenoughtoprove,inourhypotheses,thatProposition13.14holds.Wewillshow
that this descends from (13.21). Fix ψ, φ ∈H and consider corresponding sequences
ψn, φn ∈S (R3) with ψn →ψ, φn →φ in H as n →+∞. If δn := ψ −ψn and
δ′
n := ψ′ −ψ′
n, we have
|(ψ|U0(t)ψ′)| ≤|(δn|U0(t)δ′
n)|+|(δn|U0(t)ψ′
n)|+|(ψn|U0(t)δ′
n)|+|(ψn|U0(t)ψ′
n)|.
By using Schwarz’s inequality and the fact U0(t) is isometric we ﬁnd
|(ψ|U0(t)ψ′)| ≤||δn||||δ′
n|| + ||δn||||ψ′
n|| + ||ψn||||δ′
n|| + |(ψn|U0(t)ψ′
n)| .
But the norm is obviously continuous in H, and δn →0 and δ′
n →0 as n →+∞.
Hence for any given ϵ > 0, ||δn||||δ′
n|| , ||δn||||ψ′
n|| and ||ψn||||δ′
n|| are all smaller
than ϵ/4 for some large n ∈N. Therefore
|(ψ|U0(t)ψ′)| ≤3ϵ/4 + |(ψn|U0(t)ψ′
n)| .
Computing the inner product on L2(R3, dx) explicitly, and since ψn, ψ′
n, U0(t)ψ′
n ∈
S (R3), we obtain
|(ψn|U0(t)ψ′
n)| ≤||U0(t)ψ′
n||∞

R3 |ψn(x)|dx .
By (13.21) there exists T > 0 for which the right-hand side above is bounded by
ϵ/4 when t > T . Altogether, for any pair ψ, ψ′ ∈H, if ϵ > 0 there is T > 0 such
that |(ψ|U0(t)ψ′)| ≤ϵ whenever t > T .

13.1.6
The Evolution Operator in Absence of Time
Homogeneity and Dyson’s Series
We return to the evolution operator to discuss a generalisation that has to do with
Schrödinger’s equation. An important remark, made in axiom A6, is that the evolution
operator Uτ is actually independent of the initial instant. If we ﬁx the state ρ at initial
time t, UτρU ∗
τ will be the state at time t + τ. Had we ﬁxed the same state ρ at initial
time t′ ̸= t, the state at time t′ + τ would have been UτρU ∗
τ again. So the system’s
laws of dynamics are unaffected in the time interval [t, t′]. In other terms axiom A6
adopts, for the system S in the frame I , the homogeneity of time. Classically, this
situation corresponds to having the Hamiltonian not explicitly dependent on time in
the coordinates of a certain frame. This is not the case in more general dynamical
situations, like when S interacts with an evolving external world. If, on the contrary,
S is isolated (though this is not the only possibility) and we describe it in an inertial
system, then time is homogeneous, as in classical mechanics.
But if time is not homogeneous, time evolution is axiomatised as follows.
A6’. Let the quantum system S be described in an (inertial) reference frame I , with
space of states HS. There exists a family {U(t2, t1)}t2,t1∈R of unitary operators on HS,
called evolution operators from t1 to t2, satisfying, for t, t′, t′′ ∈R:
(i) U(t, t) = I,
(ii) U(t′′, t′)U(t′, t) = U(t′′, t),
(iii) U(t′, t) = U(t, t′)∗= U(t′, t)−1
and such that the function R2 ∋(t, t′) →U(t, t′) b is strongly continuous.
Furthermore, if ρ is the state at time t0, the evolved state at time t1 (which may
precede t0) is U(t1, t0)ρU(t1, t0)∗.
The main difference with axiom A6 is that now we cannot associate a self-adjoint gen-
erator to the family {U(t2, t1)}t2,t1∈R. What is more, speaking of Hamiltonian of the
system makes no longer sense, in general. We may still retain such a notion nonethe-
less (in the sense of a time-dependent Hamiltonian) by generalising Schrödinger’s
equation and deﬁning the U(t′, t) as its solutions. Formally, the operator Uτ of A6
satisﬁes Schrödinger’s equation (with ℏ= 1):
s−d
dτ Uτ = −i HUτ .
For the generalised evolution operator U(t′, t), we can assume an analogous equation
s−d
dτ U(τ, t) = −i H(τ)U(τ, t) ,
(13.44)
whenever to each instant τ an observable is assigned, called Hamiltonian at time
τ, that expresses the system’s energy (in the given frame) at time τ. This energy is,
in general, not a preserved quantity. In order to treat Eq.(13.44) rigorously we must

13.1 Quantum Dynamics and Its Symmetries

address a few delicate technical problems concerning the distinct domains of the
various H(τ). Despite that, the equation remains extremely useful in a number of
practical applications. The Dyson series, pivotal in Quantum Electrodynamics and
Quantum Field Theory, is a formal solution to (13.44). To this end let us prove a result
that illustrates the simpliﬁed situation where each Hamiltonian H(τ) is bounded and
deﬁned on the entire Hilbert space. In that case the collection of the H(τ) determines,
via (13.44), a continuous family of evolution operators U(t′, t) given by the Dyson
series.
Proposition 13.19 Let H be a Hilbert space and R ∋t →H(t) = H(t)∗∈B(H)
strongly continuous. Consider the Dyson series of the operators U(t, s):

where iterated integrals are deﬁned as in Proposition9.31. Then the series converges
uniformly. Moreover:
(a) the U(t, s) are unitary and satisfy (i), (ii), (iii) in A6’;
(b) the map R ∋(t, s) →U(t, s) is continuous in the uniform topology;
(c) the generalised Schrödinger equation holds:
s −d
dt U(t, s) = −i H(t)U(t, s) for every t, s ∈R;

Above,
T [H(t1)H(t2) · · · H(tn)] := H(τn)H(τn−1) · · · H(τ1)
is the chronological reordering operator of the product: τn is the largest among
t1, . . . , tn, then comes τn−1 ≤τn as second-largest and so on for every t1, . . . , tn,
up to the smallest value τ1.

continuous and valued in B(H), so it can be integrated. Using Proposition9.31,
where now the L1 map is the characteristic function of the interval [s, tk], the nth
term Un(t, s) in Dyson’s series, t, s ∈[T, S], satisﬁes
||Un(t, s)|| ≤Aa,b := |b −a|n

(t, s) ∈[a, b]2 .
(13.48)
As we observed in the proof of Proposition9.31, since τ →H(τ) is strongly con-
tinuous, supτ∈[a,b] ||H(τ)|| < +∞by Banach-Steinhaus. Hence 0 ≤Aa,b < +∞.
Since the series of positive terms Aa,b converges, the Dyson series converges in the
uniform topology, uniformly in (s, t) on every compact set. Therefore if every Dyson
term is uniformly continuous (proved next) then (t, s) →U(t, s) is uniformly con-
tinuous. To show that the Dyson terms are uniformly continuous, we must resort to
their recurrence relation:
Un(t, s) = −i

 t
s
H(τ)Un−1(τ, s)dτ .
(13.49)
It implies, working on the compact set [a, b] × [a, b],
||Un(t, s) −Un(t′, s′)|| ≤

so by Proposition9.31(a):

(τ,σ)∈[a,b]2 ||H(τ)||||Un−1(τ, σ)|| .
Hence if (t, s) →Un−1(t, s) is uniformly continuous, so is (t, s) →Un(t, s); in
particular
sup
τ∈[a,b]
||H(τ)||||Un−1(τ, s) −Un−1(τ, s′)|| →0 as s →s′
because the continuity of (t, s) →Un−1(t, s) on [a, b]2 implies uniform continuity
(besides, supτ∈[a,b] ||H(τ)|| < +∞exists). The induction principle tells we can just

is continuous. But this is true by (i) in Proposition9.31(c). With this we proved
(b) and part of (a). To ﬁnish (a) we will use (c), so let us prove that ﬁrst. Applying
Proposition9.31(b, c) to the terms of the Dyson series computed on ψ, differentiating
term by term and using (13.49), we arrive at
d
dt U(t, s)ψ = −i H(t)U(t, s)ψ,
i.e. s−d
dt U(t, s) = −i H(t)U(t, s), (13.50)
provided we can exchange sum and derivative. Using (13.48) together with
sup
t∈[a,b]
||H(t)|| < +∞
tells the derivatives’ series converges uniformly on compact sets in the uniform
topology, hence uniformly in the strong topology. Hence the Dyson series can be
differentiated in t (strongly) term by term, which proves (13.50) and thus (c). Now
we can ﬁnish claim (a). With a similar procedure, in particular employing Proposi-
tion9.31(ii), we obtain
d
ds (φ|U(t, s)ψ) = i(φ|U(t, s)H(s)ψ) .
From this and (13.50) follows
d
ds (φ|U(t, s)U(s, t)ψ) = i(φ|U(t, s)(H(s) −H(s))U(s, t)ψ) = 0 ,
so in particular (φ|U(t, s)U(s, t)ψ) = (φ|U(t, t)U(t, t)ψ) . But U(t, t) = I, so
U(s, t) = U(t, s)−1. From (13.50) we have
d
dt ||U(t, s)ψ||2 = d
dt (U(t, s)ψ|U(t, s)ψ) .
The right-hand side is easy, and equals
(−i H(t)U(t, s)ψ|U(t, s)ψ) + (U(t, s)ψ| −i H(t)U(t, s)ψ) = 0
by linearity in the right entry, antilinearity in the left, and because H(t) = H(t)∗.
In other words ||U(t, s)ψ|| = ||U(s, s)ψ|| = ||ψ||. Consequently every U(t, s) is
unitary, being isometric and onto. So we proved
U(t, s)∗= U(s, t) = U(t, s)−1 .

Thereremains to check (iii) of A6’. The operator V (t, s) := U(t, s)−U(t, u)U(u, s)
clearly satisﬁes d
dt V (t, s)ψ = −i H(t)V (t, s)ψ. Exactly as before
d
dt ||V (t, s)ψ||2 = d
dt (V (t, s)ψ|V (t, s)ψ) = 0 ,
by the inner product’s linearity and by H(t) = H(t)∗. Hence ||V (t, s)ψ|| =
||V (s, s)ψ||. But this is null, for U(s, s) = I and U(s, u)U(u, s) = I. Eventu-
ally, then,
U(t, s)ψ = U(t, u)U(u, s)ψ
for every ψ ∈H.
To show (13.47) it sufﬁces, starting from the last relation, to express the iterated
integrals of each series using suitable maps θ, and change names to variables, to get
(13.45). For instance
T [H(t1)H(t2)] = θ(t1 −t2)H(t1)H(t2) + θ(t2 −t1)H(t2)H(t1) ,
where θ(t) = 1 for t ≥0 and θ(t) = 0 otherwise. Integrating the sum in dt1dt2 over
[t, s]2, and swapping t1, t2 in the term with θ(t2 −t1), produces the second summand
on the right in (13.45), apart from the constant (−i)2/2!.
□
Remarks 13.20 (1) Dyson’s series, written as in (13.47), resembles the expansion of
the time-ordered exponential. For that reason the series is often encountered, with ℏ
back in, in the integral form:
U(t, s) = T

e−i

s H(τ)dτ
.
(13.51)
If H does not depend on time, the right-hand side reduces precisely to e−i (t−s)
ℏ
H as
expected.
(2) We have already noted that the Dyson series is central in Quantum Field Theory. It
is even more fundamental in perturbation theory, where the Hamiltonian decomposes
as H = H0 + V , and V is a correcting term to H0 and to the dynamics it generates.
In such cases one proceeds by the so-called Dirac’s interaction picture [Mes99,
CCP82], in which the Dyson series plays a key part. In general concrete applications
the Dyson series is used also when H is not bounded. For that reason the above
theorem does not apply and the series should be understood in a weak sense of sorts
[ReSi80].

unitary transformation. If a system S with Hamiltonian H possesses the time reversal

(We set ℏ= 1 henceforth). Equivalently,
e−it HT ρT −1e+it H = T e+it Hρe−it HT −1
for every ρ ∈S(HS).
(13.52)
Therefore time reversal, when present, is not a dynamical symmetry in the sense of
Deﬁnition13.4, owing to the sign ﬂip of time in the dynamical ﬂow. The following
important result rephrases, partially, Proposition13.2.
Theorem 13.21 Consider a system S with Hamiltonian H (of lower-bounded spec-
trum) on the Hilbert space HS. If the spectrum of H is unbounded above, every
operator T : HS →HS satisfying (13.52) is anti-unitary and such that
T −1HT = H .
This applies in particular to the time-reversal symmetry (if it exists).
Proof If V : HS →HS is unitary (or anti-unitary), then V ψ(ψ|V −1·) = V ψ(V ψ|·).
Setting Ut := e−it H and taking the unitary operator V := (T U−t)−1UtT , for any
pure state ρ = ψ(ψ| ) we have
(T U−t)−1UtT ψ

(T U−t)−1UtT ψ
 
= ψ(ψ| ) .
Hence for some χt ∈C with |χt| = 1:
(T U−t)−1UtT ψ = χtψ ,
ψ ∈H.
Replicating the argument of Theorem12.11 shows χt does not depend on ψ. What is
more, the map R ∋t →χt is differentiable: take φ ∈D(H), ψ ∈T −1D(H) with
(φ|ψ) ̸= 0 (D(H) is dense) and differentiate the identity (T U−tφ|T −1UtT ψ) =
χt(φ|ψ), if T is unitary, or (T U−tφ|T −1UtT ψ) = χt(φ|ψ) if T is anti-unitary.
Stone’s theorem guarantees derivatives exist. Hence there is a differentiable map
R ∋t →χt such that e−it HT = T χteit H, so T −1e−it HT = χteit H. Therefore
e∓itT −1HT = χteit H
with ‘−’ if T is unitary and ‘+’ if anti-unitary (cf. Exercise12.8 for the latter). Note
T −1HT is self-adjoint, so the left-hand side is a strongly continuous unitary group

parametrised by t ∈R. Applying Stone’s theorem tells D(T −1HT ) ⊂D(H) =
D(cI + H) and
∓T −1HT ↾D(H)= cI + H
where c := −i dχt
dt |t=0 .
(13.53)
The constant c is real, for ∓T −1HT −H is symmetric on D(H). As a matter of fact
(13.53) is valid everywhere on the domain of the self-adjoint operator ∓T −1HT ,
which has no self-adjoint extensions (cI + H) other than itself. Therefore
T −1HT = ∓cI ∓H .
In particular (cf. Exercise12.8 for the anti-unitary case):
σ(H) = σ(T −1HT ) = σ (∓cI ∓H) = ∓c ∓σ(H) .
Suppose σ(H) is bounded below but not above: the last identity cannot hold if on
the right there is a −sign, whichever the constant c. Then T must be anti-unitary,
and infσ(H) = inf(c + σ(H)) = c + infσ(H). Hence c = 0, as infσ(H) is ﬁnite
by assumption (σ(H) ̸= ∅is bounded below).
□
Example 13.22
(1) Let us consider a spinless non-relativistic particle described on L2(R3, dx), as
discussed in Sect.11.4. Assume that T is anti-unitary, as when the Hamiltonian is
bounded from below but unbounded above. Since the time-reversal symmetry leaves
unchanged the positions of the particles but reverts their velocities, it is expected that
the action of T on the position and momentum operators will look like this
T −1XkT = Xk ,
T −1PkT = −Pk
k = 1, 2, 3 .
(13.54)
By direct inspection one sees that, if K : L2(R3, dx) →L2(R3, dx) is the standard
complex conjugation of wavefunctions ((Kψ)(x) := ψ(x) for every x ∈R3 and
ψ ∈L2(R3, dx)), then
K −1Xk K = Xk ,
K −1Pk K = −Pk
k = 1, 2, 3 ,
(13.55)
so that K is a candidate to represent T . Let us prove that it is essentially unique.
Suppose T is an anti-unitary operator (representing the time-reversal symmetry).
Then U := T K −1 is unitary, and (13.54) and (13.55) entail
U Xk = XkU ,
U Pk = PkU ,
k = 1, 2, 3 .
(13.56)
We leave to the reader the proof of the fact that these relations imply that U commutes
with all the operators W((t, u)) of the Weyl algebra associated with the position and
momentum operators of our particle, as discussed in Proposition11.39. Alternatively

13.1 Quantum Dynamics and Its Symmetries
825
one may assume from scratch the validity of
T −1W((t, u))T = W((t, −u)) ,
for all (t, u) ∈R3 × R3 ,
(13.57)
instead of the physically equivalent identities (13.54), (13.55). Now (13.57) imme-
diately implies that U = T K −1 commutes with all the operators W((t, u)).
Since the family of operators W((t, u)) is irreducible (Proposition11.39), Propo-
sition11.37 implies that U = cI for some complex number c with |c| = 1 because
U ∗U = I. Summing up, every operator representing the time-reversal symmetry of
a spin-0 particle must have the form
T0 = eiaK ,
a ∈R .
And every such operator satisﬁes (13.54), (13.55) and (13.57), so it may be used to
represent the time-reversal symmetry of a spinless particle. Note that this anti-unitary
time-reversal operator leaves ﬁxed Hamiltonian operators of the form (13.14) and,
at least formally, also the self-adjoint extensions of
H0 = −ℏ2
2m Δ + V (x) .
(2) What happens by introducing the spin? We conﬁne ourselves to spin-1/2 par-
ticles. In this case the Hilbert space of the particle is enlarged to the tensor prod-
uct L2(R3, dx) ⊗C2, where the second factor is the spin-1/2 Hilbert space (cf.
Sect.12.3.1). Here the three spin operators are represented by (ℏ= 1)
Sk = 1
2σk ,
using the standard Pauli matrices. Let us again assume that the time-reversal operator
T : L2(R3, dx) ⊗C2 →L2(R3, dx) ⊗C2 is anti-unitary, as when the Hamiltonian
is bounded below but not above. In addition to (13.54) and (13.55) – obviously
interpreting the operators Xk and Pk as Xk ⊗I and Pk ⊗I respectively – the time-
reversal symmetry is also supposed to satisfy
T −1I ⊗SkT −1 = −I ⊗Sk
k = 1, 2, 3 .
The reason is that the relations above must be valid for the orbital angular momentum
constructed out of the Xk and Pk, and it is natural to extend these to the spin which,
in some respects, may be considered as a sort of angular momentum. By direct
inspection one sees that an anti-unitary operator which satisﬁes (13.54), (13.55) and
the constraint above is
(I ⊗iσ2)C .

826
13
Selected Advanced Topics in Quantum Mechanics
where now C is the natural complex conjugation in L2(R3, dx) ⊗C2: the unique
antilinear extension of C(ψ ⊗χ) := (Kψ) ⊗χ for every χ ∈C2 and ψ ∈
L2(R3, dx). Exactly as for the spinless caseU = T C−1 commutes with all operators
W((t, u)) ⊗I and I ⊗σk. We leave to the reader the proof of the fact that the family
of operators W((t, u)) ⊗I and I ⊗σk where (t, u) ∈R3 × R3 and k = 1, 2, 3 is
irreducible. Hence, U is again a pure phase. We conclude that the operator describing
the time-reversal symmetry of a spin-1/2 particle has necessarily the form
T1/2 = eia I ⊗iσ2C ,
a ∈R .
Comparing T0 and T1/2 we discover an important difference:
T 2
0 = I
whereas T 2
1/2 = −I .
This result is general: if Ts denotes the time-reversal operator for a particle with spin
s = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, . . ., we ﬁnd
T 2
s = (−1)2s I .
This result can be used to justify the superselection rule of the angular momentum
introduced in Example7.80.

13.2
From the Time Observable and Pauli’s Theorem to
POVMs
There is yet another consequence of the spectral lower bound of H. It addresses the
existence of a quantum observable corresponding to the classical quantity of time,
which satisﬁes canonical commutation relations with the Hamiltonian. The existence
of such an operator may be suggested by Heisenberg’s ‘time-energy’ uncertainty
relationship, mentioned in Chap.6. In Chap.11 we deduced Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle for position and momentum as a theorem, following the CCR
[X, P] = iℏI .
We might expect a self-adjoint operator T to correspond to the observable time (the
instant at which a phenomenon occurs, or its duration in a given quantum system);
it should moreover satisfy a similar commutation relation with the Hamiltonian, on
some domain:
[T, H] = iℏI ,

13.2 From the Time Observable and Pauli’s Theorem to POVMs
827
and therefore there should be an analogue time-energy uncertainty
(ΔH)ψ(ΔT )ψ ≥ℏ/2 ,
exactly as for the pair position-momentum. We saw in Chap.11 that by interpreting
in strong sense the position-momentum CCR, i.e. passing from operators to the
exponential algebra, the commutation of the exponentials determined the operators
up to unitary transformations, by virtue of the Stone-von Neumann theorem. These
alleged relations would read e−i h
ℏT e−i t
ℏH = ei ht
ℏe−i t
ℏHe−i h
ℏT . But in the case at
stake that is not possible. There no way to deﬁne properly the operator time, and
make sense of the time-energy relations: a no-go result that bears the name of Pauli’s
theorem. It is however possible to try to deﬁne the observable time, case by case, by
invoking generalised observables, which are useful in other contexts like the theory
of Quantum Information.
13.2.1
Pauli’s Theorem
Putting together a series of results collected from previous chapters we will prove
our version of a result known as Pauli’s theorem.
Theorem 13.23 Consider a system S with Hamiltonian H (with lower-bounded
spectrum) on the Hilbert space HS. Suppose there exist a self-adjoint operator T :
D(T ) →HS and a subspace D ⊂D(H) ∩D(T ) in HS on which T H and HT are
well deﬁned and the CCR (ℏ= 1)
[T, H] = i I
holds. Then none of the following facts can occur.
(a) D is dense and invariant under T and H; the symmetric operator T 2 + H 2 is
essentially self-adjoint on D.
(b) D is dense, invariant under T and H, and made of analytic vectors for both T
and H.
(c) The exponential operators satisfy CCRs:
eihT eit H = eiht eit HeihT ,
t, h ∈R.
Proof If (a) were true, by Nelson’s theorem12.89 H↾D and T↾D would be essentially
self-adjoint (making D a core for both self-adjoint operators H, T ) and there would
be a strongly continuous unitary representation of the unique simply connected Lie
group whose Lie algebra is generated by I, H, T under the CCRs and the trivial
brackets [T, I] = [H, I] = 0. But that deﬁnes the Heisenberg group H(2), as
seen in the previous chapter, and we would have proven (c). The same conclusion
follows from assuming (b) because of Theorem 12.90. So let us suppose (c) holds.

828

Going through the argument after Theorem11.45, we could prove that the W(t, h) :=
eiht/2eit HeihT satisfyWeyl’srelationsandthehypothesesofMackey’stheorem11.44.
Then the Hilbert space HS would split in an orthogonal sum HS = ⊕kHk of closed
invariant spaces under eit H and eihT for any t, h; and for any k there would be
a unitary map Sk : Hk →L2(R, dx), so Skeit H ↾Hk S−1
k
= eit X in particular,
with X denoting the standard position operator on R. Applying Stone’s theorem to
eit HHs ⊂Hs we would obtain these consequences: ﬁrstly H(Hk ∩D(H)) ⊂Hk,
secondly H ↾Hk∩D(H) is self-adjoint on Hk, and then eit H ↾Hk= eit H↾Hk ∩D(H). At this
point the condition satisﬁed by Sk would read eit H↾Hk ∩D(H) = S−1
k eit X Sk. Reapplying
Stone’s theorem would produce H↾Hk∩D(H)= S−1
k X Sk, hence
σ(H) ⊃σ(H↾Hk∩D(H)) = σ(S−1
k X Sk) = σ(X) = R .
(For the ﬁrst inclusion it sufﬁces to use the deﬁnition of spectrum.) But that is
impossible because σ(H) is bounded from below.
□
13.2.2
Generalised Observables as POVMs
The problem raised by Pauli’s theorem about the deﬁnition of time is hard, and
not yet completely construed. One attempt, that weakens the notions of observable
and PVM, has found several other uses in QM, especially in Quantum Information
[NiCh07].
Let us look into the proof of Proposition7.52, which associates probability mea-
sures to observables seen as PVMs on R: given a state ρ ∈S(H), we did not employ
requirement (b) in Proposition7.44; and concerning property (d), we only made use
of weak convergence (implied by strong convergence). So we may rephrase Propo-
sition7.52 like this.
Proposition 13.24 Let H be a Hilbert space and {P(E)}E∈B(R) a collection of oper-
ators in B(H) satisfying:
(a)’ P(E) ≥0 for every E ∈B(R);
(b)’ P(R) = I;
(c)’ for any countable set {En}n∈N of pairwise-disjoint Borel sets in R,
w-
+∞

n=0
P(En) = P (∪n∈NEn) .
If ρ ∈S(H), the mapping μρ : E →tr(P(E)ρ) is a probability measure on R.
The numbers μρ(E) are the probabilities the experimental readings of the observable
{P(E)}E∈B(R) fall in the Borel set E. Sometimes it is convenient to adopt generalised
observables, assuming they are given by maps E →P(E) satisfying conditions
(a)’, (b)’, (c)’: these are weaker than the ones for PVMs, but still guarantee μρ is a

13.2 From the Time Observable and Pauli’s Theorem to POVMs
829
probability measure. In particular, the P(E) are no longer orthogonal projectors, but
mere bounded positive operators. All this leads to the following deﬁnition. We refer
to [Ber66] for a broad mathematical treatise and [BGL95] for an extensive discussion
on the applications to QM.
Deﬁnition 13.25 Let H be a Hilbert space and (X, Σ(X)) a measurable space. A
mapping A : Σ(X) →B(H) is called positive-operator valued measure (POVM)
on X if:
(a)’ A(E) ≥0 for any E ∈Σ(X);
(b)’ A(X) = I;
(c)’ for any countable set {En}n∈N of disjoint measurable subsets in X:
w-
+∞

n=0
A(En) = A(∪n∈NEn) .
A generalised observable on H is a collection of operators {A(E)}E∈Σ(X) such that
Σ(X) ∋E →A(E) is a positive-operator valued measure.
If A is a POVM on H, since B(H) ∋A(E) ≥0 for every E ∈Σ(X), we
have A(E) = A(E)∗by Proposition3.60(f). Moreover, by Deﬁnition13.25(c, d)
0 ≤A(E) ≤I, so ||A(E)|| ≤1 from Proposition3.60(a).
On a Hilbert space H the convex set E(H) of elements A ∈B(H) with 0 ≤A ≤I
is called the space of effects, and the effects are the operators A.
Remark 13.26 Differently from PVMs, the elements of a POVM are not assumed
to commute. This feature has the nice consequence that a convex linear combination
of a pair of POVMs over the same Σ(X) is still POVM.
■
The effects on H are the operators used to build every POVM on H, and their space
is the analogue of L (H) in deﬁning observables via PVMs. The space E(H) contains
L (H) and is partially ordered by the usual relation ≥, though it is not a lattice.This
prevents a generalised interpretation of orthogonal projectors as propositions on the
system.
Extending axiom A3 from post-measurement states to generalised observables is
problematic. It is not possible to establish, in practice, in which state the system is
after a measurement whose reading is E ∈B(R) if the observable is represented by
a POVM {A(E)}E∈B(R), and without further information. The extra data is assigned
by decomposing each A(E) = B(E)∗B(E) in the POVM, where the operators
B(E) ∈B(H) are called measuring operators. If so, the post-measurement state,
if E is the outcome, is supposed to look like
ρ′ = B(E)ρB(E)∗
tr(A(E)ρ)
.
For PVMs, clearly, A(E) = B(E) are orthogonal projectors. In the general case,
since the B(E) are not required to be positive, there are an inﬁnite number of solu-

830
13
Selected Advanced Topics in Quantum Mechanics
tions B(E) to the equation B(E)∗B(E) = A(E) when A(E) is given. From the
physical viewpoint, this implies that there are inﬁnitely many different experimental
apparatuses that give the same probabilities for the outcomes.
Another remarkable difference from standard measurements is that a POVM is
not repeatable in general, even if the possible values of the measured observable form
a discrete set. Indeed, if the state ρ′ is subjected to the same measurement associated
with the same Borel set E, the new state turns out to be:
ρ′′ =
B(E)ρ′B(E)∗
tr(B(E)ρ′B(E)∗) =
B(E)B(E)ρB(E)∗B(E)∗
tr(B(E)B(E)ρB(E)∗B(E)∗)
which, in general, coincides to ρ′ only if B(E)2 = B(E). However this identity is
false for a generic element of a POVM. See [BGL95] for further details and many
examples.
Here is an interesting application of generalised observables to the deﬁnition of
time. Suppose time is deﬁned as the observable associated to the lapse it takes a
particle to hit a detector. By Pauli’s theorem13.23 such observable is unlikely going
to be deﬁned via projectors if we impose that the observable is somehow “conjugated”
to the Hamiltonian.
The attempts to deﬁne the time observable in terms of POVMs are very promising.
Candidates for a generalised time observable T , e.g. the arrival time of a free particle,
arise from a suitable POVM T := {A(E)}E∈B(R) dependent on the system [Gia97,
BrFr02]. Introducing measures μ(T )
ψ,φ(E) := (ψ|A(E)φ), E ⊂B(R), and setting
μ(T )
ψ
:= μ(T )
ψ,ψ, we can deﬁne ⟨T ⟩ψ and (ΔT )ψ as we did for PVMs. If T is built
appropriately, on suitable domains, then (ΔT )ψ(ΔH)ψ ≥ℏ/2 and analogues hold
[Gia97, BrFr02], where H is the system’s Hamiltonian. In analogy to PVMs, we
may associate to the POVM T an operator, denoted by T , characterised by being the
unique operator such that:
(ψ|T φ) :=

R
λdμ(T )
ψ,φ(λ) ,
where ψ ∈H and φ belongs to a dense and suitable domain D(T ). This T turns out to
be symmetric, but non self-adjoint. For a particle of mass m > 0, free to move along
the real axis, the operator T of [Gia97] has the obvious form T = m
2 (X P−1+P−1X),
on a suitable dense subspace of L2(R, dx).
Remarks 13.27 (1) Gleason’s theorem7.26 has an important extension (yet much
easier to prove) to generalised observables due to Busch [Bus03].
Theorem 13.28 (Busch) Let H be a complex Hilbert space of ﬁnite dimension
≥2 or separable. For any map μ : E(H) →[0, 1] such that μ(I) = 1 and

n=0 An ≤I, there exists ρ ∈S(H) such that μ(A) = tr(Aρ), A ∈E(H).
(2) An important theorem shows the tight relationship between PVMs and POVMs.

13.2 From the Time Observable and Pauli’s Theorem to POVMs
831
Theorem 13.29 (Neumark) Let (X, Σ(X)) be a measurable space and H a Hilbert
space. If A : Σ(X) →B(H) is a POVM, there exist a Hilbert space H′, an operator
U : H →H′ and a PVM P : Σ(X) →L (H′) such that A(E) = U ∗P(E)U for
every E ∈Σ(X).
Condition (b)’ in Deﬁnition13.25 and the analogue for PVMs imply U ∗U = IH,
so U is an isometry (not surjective, otherwise A would be a PVM). Hence H is
isomorphic to a (proper) closed subspace of H′. Yet P(E) does not, in general, have
a direct physical meaning, because H′ is not the system’s Hilbert space.

13.3
Dynamical Symmetries and Constants of Motion
This section is devoted to extending to QM the various versions of Noether’s theorem.
In classical theories Noether’s theorem relates dynamical symmetries to constants of
motion. In QM this relationship is as straightforward as it can get. To state the relative
theorem we need to introduce the so-called Heisenberg picture of observables.
13.3.1
Heisenberg’s Picture and Constants of Motion
Take a quantum system S described in the inertial frame I with evolution operator
R ∋τ →e−iτ H. Fix once for all the instant t = 0 for the initial conditions. Then
consider the associated continuous projective representation of R, R ∋t →γ (H)
t
:=
e−it H ·eit H, and the dual action (cf. Sect.12.1.6) on observables. If A is an observable
(possibly an orthogonal projector representing an elementary property of S) we call
AH(t) := γ (H)∗
t
(A) = eit H Ae−it H
the Heisenberg picture of A at time τ. By construction σ(AH(τ)) = σ(A) and
the observables’s spectral measures satisfy P(AH (t))(E) = γ (H)∗
t
(P(A)(E)) for any
E ∈B(R).
In Heisenberg’s picture, coherently with the symmetries’ dual action of Chap.12,
quantum states do not evolve in time and the dynamics acts on observables. In
particular, the expectation value of A on the state ρt (the evolution at time t of the
initial state ρ) can be computed either as ⟨A⟩ρt or equivalently as ⟨AH(t)⟩ρ, because
⟨A⟩ρt = tr

= ⟨AH(τ)⟩ρ
if we put ourselves in the hypotheses of Proposition11.27 (using the measure μ(A)
ρ
directly shows that the result holds generally). And the same happens for the proba-
bility that the reading of A at time τ falls within the Borel set E, if ρ was the state
at time 0:

tr(P(A)
E ρt) = tr(P(AH(t))
E
ρ) .
Remarks 13.30 (1) According to Sect.12.2.2, Heisenberg’s evolution of observables
coincides with the inverse dual action (Sect.12.22) on observables of the time dis-
placement symmetry (Remark13.1(4)). This is an immediate consequence of the fact
that time displacement is generated by −H, which entails γ (−H)∗
t
= (γ (H)∗
t
)−1. This
fact plays a crucial role in Quantum Field Theory, where the action of symmetries
on quantum-ﬁeld operators is pictured in terms of inverse dual actions (so that these
actions give rise to standard left representations of the symmetry group instead of
right representations). Heisenberg’s evolution is then the natural representation of
the time displacement symmetry.
(2) To distinguish Heisenberg’s picture from the ordinary picture in which states –
not observables – evolve, the latter is often called Schrödinger picture, a convention
we will adopt.
(3) It must be noted that an observable may depend on time in Schrödinger’s picture
as well. Better said, it is convenient to use a self-adjoint family {At}t∈R parametrised
by time t, and view it as a single observable denoted At. If so, we say the observable
depends on time explicitly. In Heisenberg’s picture time dependency takes care of
both (implicit and explicit) dependencies:
AHt(t) := γ (H)∗
t
(At) = eit H Ate−it H .
(13.58)
Now that we have seen the evolution of observables in Heisenberg’s picture, we can
introduce constants of motion by mimicking the classical deﬁnition.
■
Deﬁnition 13.31 Let S be a quantum system described on the Hilbert space HS
associatedtotheinertialframeI withHamiltonian H.Anobservable A is aconstant
of motion or a ﬁrst integral if its Heisenberg picture is does not depend on time:
AH(t) = AH(0) for any t ∈R.
(13.59)
An explicitly time-dependent observable At is called constant of motion or ﬁrst
integral provided
AHt(t) = AH0(0) for any t ∈R.
(13.60)
Remarks 13.32 (1) An observable that does not depend on time explicitly is a con-
stant of motion if and only if its Heisenberg and Schrödinger pictures coincide.
(2) The notions of Heisenberg’s picture and constants of motion extend to situations
where time is not homogeneous and with evolution operators different from U(t2, t1).
We will not worry about this.
(3) Identity (13.60) is oftentimes found in books written as
∂AHt
∂t
+ i[H, AHt(t)] = 0 ,
(13.61)

13.3 Dynamical Symmetries and Constants of Motion
833
where the partial derivative refers to the explicit time variable only, i.e. the subscript
Ht. In practice if we do not care about domain issues, that equation is a trivial conse-
quence of (13.60), and implies (13.60) if we also assume (13.58). The equivalence, in
general false, is however troublesome to prove. At any rate, the concept of constant
of motion is perfectly formalised, physically, by (13.60), with no need to differentiate
in time and incur in spurious technical problems.
■
Notation 13.33 Lestweoverburdennotationsfor(explicitly)time-dependentobserv-
ables, we will simply write AH(t) instead of AHt(t) from now on, if no confusion
arises.
■
We are ready to exhibit the relationship between constants of motion and dynamical
symmetries. In classical physics one-parameter symmetry groups are known to cor-
respond, in the various formulations of Noether’s theorem, to constants of motion.
We wish to extend that to QM. Let us start with an easy case.
Proposition 13.34 Let σ(·) := V (σ) · V (σ)−1 be a dynamical symmetry with V (σ)
simultaneously unitary and self-adjoint. Then the observable V (σ) is a constant of
motion.
Proof If Ut is the evolution operator, by Theorem13.5(b) UtV (σ)U −1
t
= V (σ).
□
It is not rare that an interesting operator is together unitary and self-adjoint (and thus
represents a symmetry and an observable). An example is the parity inversion, which
we discussed in Examples12.19. The situation is completely different from that of
classical mechanics, where a system invariant under parity inversion (or any discrete
symmetry) does not gain an associated constant of motion.
Let us deal with one-parameter groups of continuous symmetries, for which the
link dynamical symmetries–constants of motion is forthright.
To begin with we consider a time-dependent observable {At}t∈R, in a certain
system S with Hamiltonian H. If At is a constant of motion, then, by the previous

eit H Ate−it H = A0 .
If we exponentiate the self-adjoint operators in the equation we obtain
eiaeit H Ate−it H = eiaA0 ,
a relation that known properties transform into
eit HeiaAte−it H = eiaA0 ,
i.e.
eiaAte−it H = e−it HeiaA0 ,
a ∈R, t ∈R.
This equation’s interpretation in terms of dynamical symmetries is quite relevant. It
says that for any given a ∈R the symmetries {σ (At)
a
}t∈R, with

a
(ρ) := eiaAtρe−iaAt
where ρ ∈S(HS)
form, by Theorem13.5, a time-dependent dynamical symmetry of S. If we restrict to
At = A time-independent, the same argument proves that
σ (A)
a
(ρ) := eiaAρe−iaA
where ρ ∈S(HS),
deﬁnes a dynamical symmetry for every a ∈R.
All this shows that constants of motion determine dynamical symmetries but also
continuous projective representations R ∋a →σ (At)
a
(·) of R, since R ∋a →eiaAt
is strongly continuous by Deﬁnition12.40 (cf. Sect.12.2.6).
Now we ask about the converse.
Given a family of time-dependent dynamical symmetries {σ (t)
a }t∈R where R ∋
a →σ (t)
a
is a continuous projective representation of the group R for every t ∈R,
is it possible to write each one of them as σ (At)
a
(·) := eiaAt · e−iaAt, so that the self-
adjoint operators At give an (explicitly time-dependent) observable that is a constant
of motion?
According to Theorem12.45 we can always ﬁnd self-adjoint operators At such
that σ (At)
a
(·) := eiaAt · e−iaAt for every a ∈R. But these are determined up to a real
constant At →A′
t := At −c(t)I, so the point is whether one can ﬁx the maps c(t)
so that
eit H A′
te−it H = A′
0 .
The answer of the next theorem, the quantum version of Noether’s theorem, is yes.
Theorem 13.35 (“QuantumNoethertheorem”)Let S beaquantumsystem,described
on the Hilbert space HS associated to the inertial frame I , with Hamiltonian H
and dynamical ﬂow γ (H). If constants of motion and dynamical symmetries refer to
γ (H), the following facts holds.
(a) If A is a constant of motion:
σ (A)
a
(ρ) := eiaAρe−iaA ,
∀ρ ∈S(HS)
deﬁnes a dynamical symmetry for every a ∈R, and R ∋a →σ (A)
a
(·) is continuous.
(b) Let {At}t∈R be a time-dependent observable and a constant of motion. As t ∈R
varies,
σ (At)
a
(ρ) := eiaAtρe−iaAt ,
∀ρ ∈S(HS)
deﬁnes a time-dependent dynamical symmetry for every a ∈R, and R ∋a →
σ (At)
a
(·) is continuous ∀t ∈R.
(c) Let σa be a dynamical symmetry and R ∋a →σa a continuous projective
representation, ∀a ∈R. Then there exists a constant of motion A such that
σa(·) := eiaA · e−iaA ,
a ∈R.
(13.62)

13.3 Dynamical Symmetries and Constants of Motion
835
A constant of motion A′ satisﬁes (13.62) if and only if
A′ = A + cI
for some constant c ∈R.
(d) Let {σ (t)
a }t∈R be a time-dependent dynamical symmetry ∀a ∈R, and such that
the map R ∋a →σ (t)
a
is a continuous projective representation ∀t ∈R. Then there
exists a time-dependent observable {At}t∈R that is a constant of motion plus
σ (t)
a (·) := eiaAt · e−iaAt ,
a ∈R, t ∈R.
(13.63)
A time-dependent observable {A′
t}t∈R is a constant of motion satisfying (13.63) if
and only if
A′
t = At + cI
for every t ∈R and some constant c ∈R.
Proof Claims (a), (b) were proved above, while (c) is evidently a subcase of (d)
if we set σ (t)
a
= σa and At = A for any t ∈R. So there remains to prove (d).
By Theorem12.45, for any t ∈R we can write σ (t)
a (ρ) := eiaA′
tρe−iaA′
t, a ∈R,
ρ ∈S(HS), where the self-adjoint operators A′
t are given by the group R ∋→σ (t)
a
and can be redeﬁned to A′
t + c(t)I = At by adding real constants c(t). We want
to show that it is possible to ﬁx c = c(t) in order that {At}t∈R be a time-dependent
constant of motion. Let us imagine we have made a choice for those operators. By
Theorem13.5(a), for suitable unit complex numbers χ(t, a) we have
χ(t, a) = eiaA′
te−it He−iaA′
0eit H ,
(13.64)
whence χ(t, 0) = 1 for every t ∈R. Furthermore
χ(t, a)(ψ|φ) =

.
Choosing, for given t ∈R, ψ ∈(D(A′
t)) and φ ∈eit H(D(A′
0)) not orthogonal
(the domains are dense because At is self-adjoint and eit H unitary), and applying
Stone’s theorem on the right for the variable a, we obtain that the derivative in a of
the left-hand side exists for every a ∈R. At the same time (13.64) implies, for given
t ∈R:
χ(t, a + a′) = ei(a+a′)A′
te−it He−i(a+a′)A′
0eit H

For t ∈R given, the map R ∋a →χ(t, a) is differentiable and satisﬁes χ(t, a +
a′) = χ(t, a)χ(t, a′), so ∂χ(t,a)
∂a
= ∂χ(t,a)

|a=0χ(t, a). Since |χ(t, a)| = 1, χ(t, 0) =

1 for all t ∈R, the differential equation is solved by χ(t, a) = e−ic(t)a with c(t) =
i ∂χ(t,a)
∂a
|a=0 ∈R. So we have
e−ic(t)a = eiaA′
te−it He−iaA′
0eit H ,
and hence
eia(A′
t+c(t)I)e−it H = e−it HeiaA′
0 .
By (13.64) e−ic(0)a = 1 for any a ∈R, so necessarily c(0) = 0. Then the above
identity reads
eia(A′
t+c(t)I)e−it H = e−it Heia(A′
0+c(0)I) .
As we said earlier we are free to modify the A′
t by adding constants, so with At :=
A′
t + c(t)I we obtain
eiaAte−it H = e−it HeiaA0 .
(13.65)
The identity implies eit H Ate−it H = A0 so that {At}t∈R deﬁnes a time-dependent
constant of motion. To conclude observe that we are still free to modify At by adding
a real constant d(t) for every given t ∈R. But from (13.65) we immediately have
that (A1)t := At + d(t) satisﬁes
eia(A1)te−it H = e−it Heia(A1)0 ,
∀t ∈R ,
only if d(t) is constant: d(t) = c ∈R for every t ∈R.
□
Remark 13.36 Suppose the system’s Hilbert space splits in coherent sectors under
a superselection rule, and assume this rule corresponds to a certain observable Q
being deﬁned and taking a precise value in every sector, on each pure state. This is
the case of the electric charge, for example. The self-adjoint operator representing
Q is a constant of motion, since the evolution prevents the (pure) state to escape the
sector where it initially lives. This observation unveils a deep relationship, between
superselection rules and constants of motion, that proved extremely relevant in the
algebraic formulation of quantum theories [Haa96]. We will talk about it in Chap.14.

13.3.2
A Short Detour on Ehrenfest’s Theorem and Related
Mathematical Issues
Before we go on to examine the constants of motion of the Galilean group, we
would like to spend some time on a topic related to the evolution of observables.
In QM manuals there is a statement of acclaimed heuristic importance, especially
for relating QM to its classical limit, known as Ehrenfest theorem. The heart of
Ehrenfest’s theorem is, formally, quite straightforward. Take a quantum system S

13.3 Dynamical Symmetries and Constants of Motion
837
described on the Hilbert space HS and an observable or self-adjoint operator A (for
simplicity time-independent). Fix a pure state/unit vector ψ and consider its evolution
under the operator e−it H. In formal terms (overlooking domains),
d
dt ⟨A⟩ψt = d
dt

e−it Hψ
 Ae−it Hψ

= i (Hψt|Aψt) −i (ψt|AHψt)
for ψt := e−it Hψ. This implies the general Ehrenfest relation:
d
dt ⟨A⟩ψt = ⟨i[H, A]⟩ψt .
(13.66)
Although to obtain (13.66) we ignored important mathematical details, it is easy to
prove (exercise) that the relation is implied by the following three conditions: (i)
A ∈B(H); (ii) ψτ ∈D(H) around t, or equivalently ψ ∈D(H), since D(H)
is evolution-invariant; (iii) ψτ ∈D(H A) around t. It is far from easy to make
assumptions of some help to physical applications that only concern H, A, ψ and
are valid on a neighbourhood of some t. We can nevertheless weaken (i), (ii), (iii):
beside A ∈B(H), assume only ψ ∈D(H), and interpret ⟨i[H, A]⟩ψt in (13.66) as
a quadratic form:
⟨i[H, A]⟩ψt := i(Hψt|Aψt) −i(Aψt|Hψt) .
This yields a weaker version of Ehrenfest’s theorem:
d
dt ⟨A⟩ψt = i(Hψt|Aψt) −i(Aψt|Hψt) .
(13.67)
Even in this reading the statement is still too abstract, because practically every
observable A of interest in QM is not a bounded operator. In fact, the importance
of Ehrenfest’s theorem becomes evident precisely when applied to the unbounded
operators position and momentum.
Consider, to that end, a system made by a spin-zero particle of mass m, subject
to a potential V , in an inertial frame. The Hamiltonian is a self-adjoint extension
of the differential operator H0 := −ℏ2
2m Δ + V . Suppose we work with τ →ψτ,
which around t belongs to some subdomain of D(Xi H0) ∩D(H0Xi) on which the
Hamiltonian H0 is differentiable. Then (reintroducing ℏeverywhere):

Similarly, working around t with τ →ψτ in some domain inside D(Pi H0) ∩
D(H0Pi) where H0 is differentiable, we obtain

so from (13.66):

(13.69)
The classical statement of Ehrenfest’s theorem consists of the pair of Eqs.(13.68)–
(13.69), from which the mean values of position and momentum have a classical-like
behaviour. Precisely, assume the gradient of V does not vary much on the spatial
image of the wavefunction ψt(x). Then we can estimate the right-hand side of (13.69)
by

Substituting in (13.69) we get the classical equation:
d

∂xi

⟨X⟩ψt

(13.70)
The punchline is that under Ehrenfest’s equations (13.68)–(13.69), the more wave
packets cluster around their mean value – under a potential whose force varies slowly
on the packet’s spatial range – the better the momentum and position mean values
obey the evolution laws of classical mechanics.
Alas, the entire discussion is rather academic, because establishing mathematical
conditions on H0 that are physically sound and can justify in full the argument leading
to (13.68)–(13.69), is a largely unsolved problem.
Remarks 13.37 (1) Recently, conditions on H and A have been found that realise
(13.67) when A is neither bounded nor self-adjoint, including the case where A is the
position or the momentum. The result we are talking about is the following [FrKo09].
Theorem 13.38 Let H : D(H) →H, A : D(A) →H be densely-deﬁned operators
on the Hilbert space H such that:
(H1) H is self-adjoint and A Hermitian (hence symmetric);
(H2) D(A) ∩D(H) is invariant under R ∋t →e−it H, for every t ∈R;
(H3) if ψ ∈D(A) ∩D(H) then supI ||Ae−it Hψ|| < +∞for any bounded interval
I ⊂R.
Let ψt := e−it Hψ. Then for any ψ ∈D(A) ∩D(H) the map t →⟨A⟩ψt is C1 and
d
dt ⟨A⟩ψt = i(Hψt|Aψt) −i(Aψt|Hψt) .

13.3 Dynamical Symmetries and Constants of Motion
839
As earlier claimed, the above hypotheses subsume the case where A is the position
or the momentum on H = L2(Rn, dx), even though proving it is highly non-trivial
(op. cit., corollary 1.2). For it to happen it is enough that H is the only self-adjoint
extension of H0 = −Δ + V on D(Rn) with V real and (−Δ)-bounded with relative
bound a < 1, in the sense of Deﬁnition10.42.
(2) From the point of view of physics it is impossible to build an experimental
device capable of measuring all possible values of an observable described by an
unbounded self-adjoint operator. For the position observable, for instance, it would
mean ﬁlling the universe with detectors! So we expect any observable represented by
the unbounded self-adjoint operator A to be – physically speaking – indistinguishable
from the observable of the self-adjoint operator AN :=

σ(A)∩[−N,N] λd P(A)(λ) ∈
B(H), with N > 0 large but ﬁnite. The general form of Ehrenfest’s theorem(13.66)
applies to such class of observables, if we assume (ii) and (iii), or only ψ ∈D(H)
to have (13.67). In this case, though, it is not easy to use the formal commutation of
position and momentum with a Hamiltonian like −ℏ2
2m Δ + V , which would bring to
(13.68), (13.69).

13.3.3
Constants of Motion Associated to Symmetry Lie
Groups and the Case of the Galilean Group
Consider a quantum system S with Hilbert space HS, Hamiltonian H and inertial
frame I . Suppose there is a Lie group G with a strongly continuous unitary repre-
sentation G ∋g →Ug on HS, and assume the evolution operator R ∋t →e−it H
coincides with the representation of a one-parameter subgroup of G (clearly G is a
symmetry group for S, since the representation U induces a projective representa-
tion of the same group). What we want to prove is that every T ∈TeG determines
a dynamical symmetry and a constant of motion (explicitly time-dependent, in gen-
eral). In fact,
Theorem 13.39 Let S be a quantum system on the Hilbert space HS, with Hamil-
tonian H (in some inertial frame). Let G ∋g →Ug be a strongly continuous
unitary representation on HS of the n-dimensional Lie group G, and deﬁne the evo-
lution operator R ∋t →e−it H as the representation of a given one-parameter
subgroup generated by h ∈TeG:
e−it H = Uexp(th) ,
t ∈R.
(a) To each b ∈TeG there correspond a constant of motion {Bt}t∈R, in general time-
dependent, and an associated dynamical symmetry according to Theorem 13.35.
(b) The operator −i Bt (restricted to the Gårding space) for t ∈R is the image under
the Lie-algebra isomorphism (12.113) of some element bt of the Lie algebra of G

840
13

such that b0 = b.
(c) If [h, b] = 0 the constant of motion {Bt}t∈R is time-independent.
Proof (a)–(b). Consider the map R →G:
R ∋a →exp(th) exp(ab) exp(−th) .
It is certainly a one-parameter subgroup for any given b ∈TeG and every t ∈R. So
if T1, . . . Tn is a basis of TeG, for suitable real functions c j = c j(t) we can write
exp(th) exp(ab) exp(−th) = exp(a
n

j=1
c j(t)Tj) =: exp(abt) .
Apply U and pass to the Lie algebra representation TeG ∋b →AU[b] :=
AU(b)↾DG, where the Gårding space DG is invariant and a core for the self-adjoint
operators AU(b) (Chap.12, in particular Theorem12.79 and Corollary 12.87). Then
e−it He−iaAU [b]eit H = e−ian
j=1 c j(t)AU [Tj] = e−iaAU (bt) .
(13.71)
Deﬁne self-adjoint operators parametrised by time
Bt :=
n

j=1
c j(t)AU[Tj] = AU(bt) .
Then (13.71) shows Bt is a constant of motion that depends explicitly on time, for
(13.71) implies:
eit H Bte−it H = AU(b) = B0 ,
t ∈R .
Again (13.71) shows that the family of symmetries σ (t)
a
:= e−iaBt · eiaBt, for any
a ∈R, is a time-dependent dynamical symmetry. In fact (13.71) forces
e−iaBte−it H = e−it He−iaB0 ,
t ∈R,
and then Theorem13.5 proves the claim.
(c) Assuming [b, h] = 0, and using the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula (12.81),
(12.82), (12.83), we obtain
exp(τh) exp(ab) = exp(ab) exp(τh)
(13.72)
so long as |a|, |τ| < ϵ with ϵ > 0 small enough. Those formulas actually hold for
any value of a, τ ∈R. To see that, it sufﬁces to observe, irrespective of a and τ, that
we can write a = N
r=1 ar and τ = N
r=1 τr so that |ar|, |τr| < ϵ for any r. For
example,

exp(τh) exp(ab) = exp(τN h) · · · exp(τ2h) exp(τ1h) exp(a1b) exp(a2b) · · · exp(aN b)

so
eτheab = eabeτh .
Consequently, deﬁning t = −τ and using U we get
eit He−iaAU (b)e−it H = e−iaAU (b) ,
whence the claim.
□
To exemplify the general result found above, we revert to the Galilean group and its
projective unitary representations seen at the end of the previous chapter. We will
show there are 10 ﬁrst integrals for a system having the restricted Galilean group SG
as symmetry group (described by a unitary representation of a central extension of
the universal covering 
SG ). We consider in particular the spinless particle of mass
m, and refer to the unitary representation of the central extension !

SG m of Chap.12.
The Lie algebra is the extension of the Lie algebra of 
SG , which has 10 generators
−h , pi , ji , ki,
i = 1,2,3, such that:
(i) −h generates the subgroup R ∋c →(c, 0, 0, I) of time displacements,
(ii) the pi generate the Abelian subgroup R3 ∋c →(0, c, 0, I) of space transla-
tions,
(iii) the ji generate the subgroup SO(3) ∋R →(0, 0, 0, R) of space rotations,
(iv) the ki generate the Abelian subgroup R3 ∋v →(0, 0, v, I) of pure Galilean
transformations.
Remark 13.40 We have already remarked that time displacement and time evolution
are one the inverse of the other. Hence h is the generator of time evolution in accor-
dance with the notation used in Theorem13.39, whereas −h is the generator of time
displacement. This observation should explain the conventional sign of the generator
of time translations: one considers time evolution to be physically more important
than time displacement.
■
These elements obey the commutation relations (12.144). To pass from the Lie alge-
bra of 
SG to that of !

SG m we add a generator commuting with the above ones, plus
central charges for the commutation relations between ki and p j equal to the mass m

[pi, −h] = 0 ,
[ji, −h] = 0 ,

(13.73)
Adapting the proof of Theorem13.39 to the representation !


the ﬁrst two brackets give
e−iτ He−iaPi = e−iaPi e−iτ H
(13.74)
and
e−iτ He−iaLi = e−iaLie−iτ H .
(13.75)
Using Theorem13.5 and Deﬁnition13.31, these tell, in agreement with Theo-
rem13.39:
(a) the three momentum components and the three orbital angular momentum
components are (time-independent) constants of motion;
(b) the symmetries generated by these integrals of motion, i.e. the translations
along the axes and the rotations about the axes are (time-independent) dynamical
symmetries (see Examples12.46 and (12.135) for the explicit action on wavefunc-
tions).
Let us address the last bracket in (13.73). A direct use of the Baker–Campbell–
Hausdorff formula is not trivial, even if technically possible with a bit of work, also
in the general case. To understand what this third identity corresponds to in terms
of the associated one-parameter subgroups, let us study the matter in the Galilean
group. The subgroup generated by −h is the time displacement:
exp(τh) = (−τ, 0, 0, I) τ ∈R .
The subgroup generated by k j is a pure Galilean transformation along the jth axis
with unit vector e j:
exp(ak j) = (0, 0, ae j, I) a ∈R : .

13.3 Dynamical Symmetries and Constants of Motion
843
Immediately, then, the group law (12.137) gives
exp(τh) exp(ak j) exp(−τh) = exp(a(τp j + k j)) .
Applying the unitary representation these become
e−iτ He−aK j eiτ H = e−ia(τ Pj↾DG +K j↾DG) .
Therefore, if we deﬁne self-adjoint operators
K jt := t Pj ↾DG +K j ↾DG
j = 1, 2, 3,
each observable is a constant of motion explicitly dependent on time, and each one
deﬁnes a dynamical symmetry for every a ∈R:
e−iaK jte−it H = e−it He−iaK j0
The dynamical symmetry e−iaK jt thus deﬁnes a pure Galilean transformation along
e j at time t.
Remarks 13.41 (1) It can be interesting to question about the meaning of the con-
servation law of K jt, which is not at all obvious. We remind that the boost is deﬁned
(see (12.152)) as K j = −mX j. Choosing ψ ∈DG and letting it evolve under the
evolution operator, ψt := e−it Hψ, the conservation law for K jt implies:
t(ψt|Pjψt) −m(ψt|X jψt) = const,
i.e.
⟨Pj⟩ψt = m d
dt ⟨X j⟩ψt .
(13.76)
Hence the average momentum of the particle is, in some sense, the product of the
mass times the velocity, the latter indicating the average position of the particle. The
result is a priori not evident, since in QM the momentum is not the product of mass
and velocity.
(2) Suppose we work with a multi-particle system, admitting the Galilean group as
symmetry group described by a unitary representation of a central extension associ-
ated to the total mass M (see Chap.12). Identity (13.76) is proved in the same way,
and hence holds true. But now Pj is the component along e j of the total momentum,
and X j is the e j-component of the position vector of the centre of mass. A similar
relationship holds for systems invariant under the Poincaré group, and follows from
the invariance under pure Lorentz transformations. The term corresponding to the
total mass accounts for the energy contributions of the single components (like the
kinetic energies of the isolated points making the system), in conformity to equation
M = E/c2.

This accounts for 9 ﬁrst integrals, but we said there are 10 in total.
The attentive reader will have noticed there is still a dynamical symmetry around,
and a corresponding conservation law: yes, energy! Namely, the obvious commu-
tation relation [h, h] = 0 holds on the Lie algebra, or [H, H] = 0 at the level of
self-adjoint generators, or [e−iτ H, e−iτ ′ H] = 0 for the exponentials. By Theorem13.5
and Deﬁnition13.6, the last identity, in agreement with Theorem13.39, says that
(a) the Hamiltonian is a constant of motion,
(b) the symmetry generated by −H (the time displacement) is a dynamical sym-
metry.
The result is completely general and does not depend on having the Galilean group
as symmetry group; it sufﬁces that the Hamiltonian exists.

Compound Systems and Their Properties
We met in Chap.12 systems composed by subsystems, and we saw that the overall
Hilbert space is the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces relative to the subsystems. But
this is actually an axiom of the theory. Compound systems bear a host of fascinating
non-classical features, which we will review in this section.
13.4.1
Axiom A7: Compound Systems
We are ready to state the seventh axiom of QM, the one about compound quantum
systems. For the mathematical contents we refer to the deﬁnitions and results of
Sect.10.2.1.
A7. When a quantum system consists of a ﬁnite number N of subsystems, each
described on a Hilbert space Hi ̸= {0}, i = 1, 2, . . . , N, the comprehensive system
is described on the Hilbert space "N
i=1 Hi.
Any observable Ai : D(Ai) →Hi on the ith subsystem (including elementary
observables deﬁned by orthogonal projectors) is identiﬁed in the larger system with
the observable I ⊗· · · ⊗I ⊗Ai ⊗I ⊗· · · ⊗I.
Two are the types of compound systems we have already met: those made of ele-
mentary particles with internal structure, and multi-particle systems (elementary
particles with or without internal structure). In the ﬁrst case the Hilbert space is
L2(R3, dx) ⊗H0, where H0 is ﬁnite-dimensional and describes the particle’s inter-
nal degrees of freedom: spin and charges of various sort (cf. Chap.11). By elementary
particle with internal structure we mean that the internal space is ﬁnite-dimensional.
The literature, when referring to systems of elementary particles with space H0, calls
L2(R3, dx) the orbital space or space of orbital degrees of freedom, and H0 the

13.4 Compound Systems and Their Properties

internal space or space of internal degrees of freedom. In case the space of internal
freedom degrees describes a (certain type of) charge, we should also keep possible
superselection rules into account.
WewouldliketomakeafewremarksontheHamiltonianoperatorofmulti-particle
systems, when the single Hilbert spaces are L2(R3, dx) with a ﬁxed inertial frame,
and R3 is the rest space (using orthonormal Cartesian coordinates). The Hilbert
space of a system on N particles with masses m1, . . ., m N is the N-fold tensor
product of L2(R3, dx). From Example10.27(1) this product is naturally isomorphic
to L2(R3N, dx). Indicate by (x1, . . . , xN) the generic point in R3N, where xk =
((xk)1, (xk)2, (xk)3) is the triple of orthonormal Cartesian coordinates of the kth
factor of R3N = R3 × · · · × R3. The natural isomorphism turns (prove it as exercise)
the position operator of the kth particle into the multiplication by the corresponding
xk = ((xk)1, (xk)2, (xk)3), and the momentum into the unique self-adjoint extension
of the xk-derivatives (times −iℏ), for instance on D(R3N). The Hamiltonians of each
particle, assumed free, coincide with the self-adjoint extension, say on D(R3N), of
the corresponding Laplacian −Δk = 3
i=1
∂2
∂(xk)2
i times −ℏ2/(2mk). Relying on
Sect.11.5.8, if the particles undergo interactions described classically by a potential
V = V (x1, . . . , xN), the Hamiltonian is expected to be some self-adjoint extension
of
H0 :=
N

k=1

Δk + V (x1, . . . , xN) .
For instance, particles with charges ek interacting with one another under Coulomb
forces and also with external charges Qk are expected to have as Hamiltonian a
self-adjoint extension of
H0 :=

As we explained in Sect.10.4 and Examples10.52, important results mainly due to
Kato imply, under natural assumptions on V , that not only H0 is essentially self-
adjoint on standard domains like D(R3N) or S (R3N), but the only self-adjoint
extension is bounded below, therefore making the system energetically stable. This
happens in particular for the operator with the Coulomb interaction presented above
(cf. Examples10.52).
If the N particles have an internal structure, with internal Hilbert space H0k, the
overall Hilbert space will be isomorphic to L2(R3N, dx) ⊗N
k=1 H0k, and the possible
Hamiltonians are more complicated, usually. We encourage the reader to consult the
specialised texts [Mes99, CCP82, Pru81, ReSi80] for examples of this kind.

Independent Subsystems: The Delicate Viewpoint of
von Neumann Algebra Theory
Apropos compounds of independent subsystems, we shall make a few superﬁcial
observations from a more abstract point of view (see [ReSu07, ReSu10]). Suppose
that a quantum system S described by the von Neumann algebra R on the Hilbert
space H contains mutually independent subsystem Sk, k = 1, . . . , N with corre-
sponding von Neumann algebras of observables Rk on H. We expect that
Rk ⊂R′
h
if k ̸= h,
(13.77)
because the subsystems are independent and any two observables of different sub-
systems are therefore always compatible. For the same reason
Rk ∩Rh = {cI | c ∈C} when k ̸= h
(13.78)
because Rk contains non-trivial observables of Sk but not of Rh. If S is consists of
Sk only (no other independent subsystem exists) then we may assume that
R =
 N
#
k=1
Rk
′′
.
(13.79)
Further possible requirements for describing independent subsystems will be about
states. Consider a system made of N subsystems, so that its von Neumann algebra
R is the product R1 ⊗· · · ⊗RN of N von Neumann algebras on the same Hilbert
space, whose pairwise intersections are trivial. Given N normal states ρ1, . . . , ρN
(i.e. positive trace-class operators of unit trace, Remark7.73(2)) on the respective
von Neumann algebras Rk, it is reasonable to assume that there is an extension ρ
deﬁning a (normal) state on R with the separability property
tr(ρ(A1 · · · An)) = tr(ρ1A1) · · · tr(ρN AN) ∀Ak ∈Rk, k = 1, . . . , N.
(13.80)
(Another condition is the injectivity of the GNS representation associated to ρ when
the GNS representations of the ρk are injective. We will not pursue this now, as
it is related to Chap.14). We can assume an even more abstract viewpoint. Sup-
pose we start from N von Neumann algebras Mk over different Hilbert spaces Hk,
forming a compound system described on H by the von Neumann algebra R. The
previous discussion is still valid if there exist injective ∗-homomorphisms of von
Neumann algebras hk : Mk →R (in particular, hk maps the identity to the identity:
hk(Ik) = I), so that each Mk is identiﬁed with a von Neumann subalgebra Rk ⊂R.
This identiﬁcation is also topological, by Remark3.95(2). A stronger version would
require that the isomorphisms hk be implemented unitarily. Conditions (13.77)–
(13.80) are supposed to be valid for the hk-images Rk in place of the algebras Mk

themselves. We leave it to the reader to discover the related picture involving elemen-
tary propositions (orthogonal projectors) of LMk(Hk), LR(H) and isomorphisms of
(σ-)complete orthocomplemented lattices.
What is the relationship between axiom A7 and this abstract and apparently more
general approach to composite systems? Let us prove that they are in agreement
axiom A7, as a special case of the more general notion of composite system.
When Rk ⊂B(Hk), axiom A7 gives a natural procedure to build H and R under
(13.77)–(13.79): beside H = ⊗n
k=1Hk we also have R = ⊗N
k=1Rk, the tensor product
of von Neumann algebras as of Deﬁnition10.34 (in particular, Theorem10.35 holds).
Each map
hk : Rk ∋A →I ⊗· · · ⊗I ⊗A ⊗I ⊗· · · ⊗I⊗∈⊗N
k=1Rk ,
with A in the kth entry in the right-hand side, is a ∗-isomorphism onto its image,
the von Neumann subalgebra CIH1 ⊗· · · ⊗Rk ⊗· · · ⊗CIHN of ⊗N
k=1Rk. Moreover
(13.80) is also valid, simply by setting ρ := ρ1⊗· · ·⊗ρN, where each ρk is a positive
trace-class operator of trace one on Hk, deﬁning a normal state on Rk.
Yet no one says that tensor products of Hilbert spaces and von Neumann alge-
bras is the only possibility to describe compound system in terms of the algebras
of observables of the subsystems. Indeed, there exist compound systems – in the
abstract sense of (13.77)–(13.79) – for which R ⊂B(H) cannot be interpreted as
the tensor product of the Rk ⊂B(H) of its subsystems, if at the same time we wish
to identify each Rk with a von Neumann algebra ˆRk ⊂B(Hk) over a suitable Hilbert
space Hk, so that H is isomorphic to ⊗N
k=1Hk.
The identiﬁcations simultaneously regard Hilbert spaces and von Neumann alge-
bras, so they should be implemented by a unitary operator. As a matter of fact, we
must look for a surjective, norm-preserving operator U : H →⊗N
k=1Hk such that
URkU −1 = CIH1 ⊗· · · ⊗ˆRk ⊗· · · ⊗CIHN
for k = 1, 2, . . . , N
and
R = U −1 ˆR1 ⊗· · · ⊗ˆRNU
hold.
Here is an elementary example to make the point. Suppose that R1 is a factor
on the Hilbert space H, and deﬁne R2 := R′
1. Then R1 ∩R2 = {cI | c ∈C}
and (R2 ∪R2)′′ = B(H), and hence (13.77)–(13.79) are satisﬁed. We interpret6 the
picture as that of a bipartite system with total algebra of observables R := B(H) and
subsystems’ algebras R1, R2. It will not be possible to interpret the tensor product
with axiom A7. In fact, when R1 is not of type I, we cannot ﬁnd Hilbert spaces H1,
H2 with von Neumann algebras ˆR1 ⊂B(H1), ˆR2 ⊂B(H2), and a unitary operator
6According to Sect.11.2.3, another natural interpretation would be that R2 is the algebra generated
by the gauge group of a system with von Neumann algebra of observables R1, in absence of Abelian
superselection rules.

U : H →H1 ⊗H2, satisfying UR1U −1 = ˆR1 ⊗CIH2 and UR2U −1 = CIH1 ⊗ˆR2
[KaRi97, vol. II, p. 816]. On the other hand, if R1 has type In, so R2 has type Im
(n, m = 1, 2, . . . , +∞), then U does exist, and moreover ˆR1 = B(H1), ˆR2 =
B(H2). Hence we also have (13.80). In standard Quantum Mechanics, fortunately,
all operator algebras are of type I (or direct sums of such), so no problems arise.
For extended thermodynamical systems, or in Quantum Field Theory, the picture is
much more delicate: factors of other type appear (type-III factors, see [Haa96, Rob04,
ReSu07] for instance) and tensor products may no longer be appropriate to describe
compound systems. In Chap.14 we shall take the next step in the abstraction and
describe observables using C∗-algebras. When one plays that game, though, there is
no unique deﬁnition of tensor product [KaRi97, Sect.11.3].
We will not address these advanced issues in this book and just stick to axiom A7
as it stands. For a detailed study of independent subsystems from the viewpoint of
von Neumann algebras (and C∗-algebras) the reader is advised to look in [Red98,
ch. 10–12]. Those three chapters also analyse the implications in Quantum Field
Theory, especially with regard to the EPR paradox. We will cover the latter in the
next section, albeit from a much more elementary point of view.
13.4.3
Entangled States and the So-Called “EPR Paradox”
A measuring device is not necessarily located at a point in space. On the contrary,
if we want to measure quantities deﬁned in space, ﬁrst and foremost the position
of a quantum particle, we must ﬁll space with instruments: particle detectors that
measure the position. The process of reduction of the state described by axiom A3 is
“instantaneous”. This means that once a device has detected the particle at the point
p and at time t, from that instant onwards no other device, as remote in space as we
want from the ﬁrst detector, will be able to detect the particle. The reduction of state
therefore seems to be a nonlocal process: apparently it implies a “simultaneous”
transmission of information between faraway places. This appears to violate the
principles of the theory of relativity. In 1935 Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen [Des99,
Bon97, Ghi07, Alb94], whilst considering systems of two particles, showed that the
question can be phrased in physically-operative terms by which the violation seems
to materialise effectively [EPR35].
Axiom A7 describes the possible states of a compound quantum system. Let S be
a system made of two subsystems A, B. The Hilbert space of S is HS = HA ⊗HB,
in the obvious notations. The vectors of HA ⊗HB are not just of the factorised sort
ψA⊗ψB, with one tensor product, for there are linear combinations of these products,
too, like
Ψ = ψA ⊗ψB −ψ′
A ⊗ψ′
B
√
2
.
(13.81)

13.4 Compound Systems and Their Properties
849
Pure states corresponding to unit vectors of the above form are called entangled
pure states.7
Consider the entangled state associated to the vector Ψ of (13.81), and let us
suppose ψA and ψ′
A are eigenstates normalised to 1 of some observable G A with
discrete spectrum on system A, respectively corresponding to distinct eigenvalues a
and a′. Assume the same for ψB, ψ′
B: they are unit eigenstates of an observable G B
with discrete spectrum on system B, with eigenvalues b ̸= b′.
The discrete-spectrum observables G A, G B are, for instance, relative to internal
freedom degrees of the systems A and B. They can typically be components of the
spin or the polarisation of the particles. In that case the spaces HA, HB are also
factorised into orbital space and internal space.
Until we measure it, the quantity G A is not deﬁned on the system, if the latter is
in the state given by Ψ ; there are two possible values a, a′ with probability 1/2 each.
The same pattern is valid for G B. The minute we measure G A, reading – say – a (a
priori unpredictable, at least in principle), the state of the total system changes, in
allegiance to axiom A3, becoming the pure state of the unit vector
ψA ⊗ψB .
The crucial point is the following: if the initial state is the entangled state Ψ , the
measurement of G A determines a measurement of G B as well: in the pure state asso-
ciated to ψA ⊗ψB the value of G B is well deﬁned, and equals b in our conventions.
Any measurement of G B can only give b.
Following the famous study of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, consider now com-
pound systems of two particles A, B, prepared in the entangled pure state of the
vector Ψ of (13.81), that move away from each other at great speed (i.e., the state’s
orbital part is the product of two very concentrated packets that separate rapidly from
each other). In principle we can measure G A and G B on the respective particles in
distant places and at lapses so short that no physical signal, travelling below the speed
of light, can be transmitted from one experiment to the other in good time.
If axiom A3 is to be valid, there should be a correlation between the outcomes:
every time the reading of G A is a (or a′), G B will give b (respectively, b′).
How can system A communicate to system B the outcome of the measurement
of G A in time to produce the aforementioned correlations, without breaching the
cornerstones of relativity?
This is a common situation in classical systems too, and in that case the explana-
tion is very easy: there is no superluminal communication between the systems, for
the correlations pre-exist the measurements. We call local realism this viewpoint,
though, philosophically speaking, local realism is a much more articulate position.
For example, let the observed quantities G A, G B be some particle “charge” or the like,
and suppose the overall system S has charge 0 in the state in which it has been pre-
pared, while the particles could have charge ±1 corresponding to the aforementioned
7Analogously, for mixed states: ρ ∈S(HA ⊗HB) is entangled if it is not a convex combination
of states of the form ρA ⊗ρB, ρA ∈S(HA), ρB ∈S(HB).

values a, a′ and b′, b. If we reason with classical particles, we have to conclude one
particle has charge 1, the other −1. If the values of charge are pre-existent, i.e. if they
exist before and independently of the fact that we take a measurement to observe
the charge, we can rest assured that if a particle has charge 1 when measured, the
second one will give −1 when observed, irrespective of where and when charges are
measured, because the values are ﬁxed beforehand.
The picture described by QM is, however, different: even if the state associated to
Ψ has total charge G = G A+G B equal to 0, the subsystems’s charges are not deﬁned
on the state of Ψ , and become ﬁxed at the time of the measurement (of either state).
Therefore the situation pre-existing the measurement cannot be held responsible for
the correlations predicted by QM, if we accept the standard interpretation of QM.
The idea of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen was that if said correlations were really
observed (as required by QM), and since defying the assumption of relativistic local-
ity was out of the question, the reason for the correlations was due to a pre-existing
state to the measurements. As this cannot be described in the framework of the stan-
dard formulation of QM, it would have proved that the standard formulation of QM
was, by nature, incomplete. (The probabilities used in QM, moreover, would reduce
to mere epistemic probabilities).
J. Bell, in a brilliant paper published in 1964 [Bel64, Bon97, Ghi07], while mea-
suringatleastthreetypesof“charges”producingcorrelations(inrealityonemeasures
three spin components for massive particles or polarisation states of photons), proved
it is possible to distinguish experimentally between two situations, where the charges
are either:
(i) ﬁxed before the measurements,
or
(ii) ﬁxed at the same time of the measurements.
Bell proved that case (i) occurs only if the outcomes obey a series of inequalities:
the celebrated Bell inequalities.
It is important to remark that a potential experimental infringement of Bell’s
inequalities does not automatically validate the standard formulation of QM. Non-
local correlations, if observed experimentally, could in principle be justiﬁed without
QM. What is true is that Quantum Mechanics, in contrast to Classical Mechanics,
forecasts the presence of the correlations and at the same time the violation of Bell’s
inequalities, as we will see in short.
13.4.4
Bell’s Inequalities and Their Experimental Violation
We will discuss brieﬂy the simpliﬁed version of Bell’s inequalities proposed by
Wigner and d’Espagnat. The Wigner-d’Espagnat inequality has never, up to now,
been used in practical experiments. We essentially follow the presentation by Sakurai
[Sak94].
Take two particles A, B of spin 1/2 produced together, in a region O, in the
“singlet state”, i.e. in the unique pure state of zero total spin. Fix an inertial system

where the phenomenon is described. The entangled pure spin state is representable
by Ψsing in the spin space HAspin ⊗HBspin:
Ψsing = ψ(n)

√

,
(13.82)
where each HAspin, HBspin is isomorphic to C2, since each particle has spin s = 1/2.
Moreover, ψ(n)
+ and ψ(n)
−are unit eigenvectors with respective eigenvalues 1/2, −1/2
for the spin operator Sn := n · S along n (unit three-dimensional vector), for the sin-
gle particle (as usual, ℏ= 1). The decomposition (13.82) holds for the singlet state
Ψsing, irrespective of where the axis n is.
We suppose the particles part from each other. In other words the state’s orbital
part will, for example, be a product of wavefunctions, one in the orbital variables of
A and one in the orbital variables of B, given by packets concentrated around their
centres. The packets move away quickly from O in the chosen frame, so that the
packets never overlap when the spin measurements are taken on A and B (we will
not discuss the case of identical particles, which is practically the same anyway).
To study the correlation of spin measurements that violate locality, actually, it is not
even necessary to assume the orbital part has the form we said. It sufﬁces to place
the devices measuring spin in faraway regions OA, OB (and far from O), and make
sure the axis of the spin analyser of A in OA can be re-oriented during consecutive
measurements (see below) fast enough to prevent signals from propagating sublu-
minally from OA and reach OB during measurements on the spin of B. This setup
was concretely put into practice by Aspect’s experiments.
To ﬁx ideas imagine OB is on the right of O and OA on the left. The spin mea-
surements in A and B (even two or more consecutive readings along distinct axes
for each particle) can be taken, independent of one another, along given independent
directions u, v, w, not necessarily orthogonal. Assume at last that N pairs AB in spin
singlet state are generated in O, and that each pair is then analysed by spin measure-
ments on A, B in OA, OB along three given independent unit vectors u, v, w. Suppose
that on the N pairs the values of the spin components are ﬁxed before measuring in
OA and OB. This is the contrary of what the standard formulation of QM predicts.
In order to have zero total spin, for each pair AB the spin triples (Su, Sv, Sw)A for A
and (Su, Sv, Sw)B for B must have opposite corresponding components. For instance,
(+, −, +)A and (−, +, −)B are admissible, whereas (+, +, +)A and (−, +, −)B are
not (from now on we shall abbreviate +1/2 by + and −1/2 by −). There are 8 pos-
sible combinations altogether, tabled below.
Among the N pairs there will be N1 pairs (+, +, +) for A and (−, −, −) for B
irrespective of whether measured or not, N2 pairs (+, +, −) for A and (−, −, +)
for B irrespective of whether measured or not, and so on. At any rate we will have
N = 8
n=1 Nk.
With our “classical” hypotheses, every pair among the N examined must belong,
after it has been created, in one of the sets, independently of what sort of spin
measurements is taken. So let us suppose, for a certain pair, we measure Su on A

there are N3 + N4 possibilities out of N that this happens. If we call p(u+, v+) the
probability of ﬁnding + measuring Su on A and + measuring Sv on B, we have
p(u+, v+) = N3 + N4

(13.83)
Similarly
p(u+, w+) = N2 + N4

p(w+, v+) = N3 + N7

N
= p(u+, w+) + p(w+, v+) ,
i.e. Bell’s inequalities hold:
p(u+, v+) ≤p(u+, w+) + p(w+, v+) .
(13.85)
These inequalities hold whatever basis of unit vectors (not necessarily orthogonal)
u, v, w we pick, provided the values of the spin components along them are deﬁned
before we take the spin measurements, and the total spin of each pair is null. QM’s
prediction leads to a violation of the inequalities if we choose the axes suitably.
Compute ﬁrst p(u+, v+) with the quantum recipe. Suppose the measure on A of Su
is +. Measuring Su on B will give (or has already given) −, by (13.82). Anyway,
particle B will have spin state represented by ψ(u)
−in the eigenvector basis of Su. So
we can evaluate p(u+, v+) as:

where 1/2 is the initial probability of having + on A when measuring Su in state

angle θuv between u and v:

Remark 13.42 Despite the whole theory has unfolded within the non-relativistic for-
malism, one could already at this juncture raise an important question, unabated when
passing to the relativistic formalism. In the quantum commutation of p(u+, v+) we
assumed we had measured ﬁrst the spin of A, and then the spin of B. If measurements
are taken in causally disjoint spacetime events – events that cannot be connected by
future-directed timelike or spacelike paths – then the chronological order of the
events is conventional, and depends on the choice of (inertial) frame, as is well
known in special relativity. Thus we can ﬁnd a frame where B is measured before
A. So the question is whether computing p(u+, v+) in this situation – which by the
principle of relativity is physically equivalent to the previous one – gives the same
result found earlier. Leaving behind the issue of a relativistic formalisation, the prob-
ability p(u+, v+) is easily seen not to change, since the particles’ spin observables
commute. We will return to this kind of problem later.

Since 1972 several experiments have been conducted to test the existence of the
aforementioned correlations, and the truth or falsity of Bell’s inequalities (an impor-
tant experiment was made in 1982 by A. Aspect, J. Dalibard and G. Roger [Bon97,
Ghi07]). As a byproduct of the large number of experimental tests over the years,
various common deﬁciencies in the testing of Bell’s theorem have been found, in par-
ticular the detection loophole and communication loophole. The experiments have
been gradually improved to better deal with these loopholes. In 2015, for the ﬁrst
time, R. Hanson and collaborators8 corroborated the violation of Bell’s inequalities
during an experimental test of Bell’s theorem. The reported results are free of any
additional assumptions or loophole. Within the acceptability range of experimen-
tal errors, we can conclude that (a) the nonlocal correlations predicted by QM do
exist, (b) Bell’s inequalities are violated. Unless we deny the validity of the above

experiments, therefore, and independent of whether we accept or not the standard
formulation of Quantum Mechanics, we must agree that the correlations anticipated
by Quantum Mechanics exist, and the outcomes are ﬁxed at the moment of the mea-
surements. Most physicists nowadays think that local realism is untenable. From a
philosophical viewpoint, however, local realism cannot be excluded completely if we
adopt extreme (unfalsiﬁable) assumptions such as the hypothesis of superdetermin-
ism, where everything, including all experiments and outcomes, is predetermined.

EPR Correlations Cannot Transfer Information
Although we developed QM in its non-relativistic version, the problems posed by the
EPR analysis do not substantially change in the relativistic framework. But one ques-
tion remains unanswered (we retain the conventions and notations of Sect.13.4.3):
how does system A communicate to system B the outcome of the measurement of
G A, in time to produce the correlations we know of, and without destroying the cor-
nerstones of relativity?
The answer is quite intricate, and by no means conclusive. First of all, one has to
say that the question is ill posed, because it understates that the outcome of measuring
G A causes the outcome of G B. In spacetime regions where the two measurements
are taken (or can be taken) the latter are, in relativistic language, causally disjoint:
there is no future-directed “spacelike” or “timelike” path in spacetime joining them.
It is well known from relativity that there exists an inertial system in which A is mea-
sured before B, and another one where the situation is opposite: the measurement
of B precedes in time the measurement of A. So it makes no sense to say that the
outcome of the experiment on A is the consequence, or the cause, of the outcome
on B. One could, notwithstanding, resort to the partial conventionality of Einstein’s
synchronisation procedure in order to dismiss that problem. But despite the con-
ventional choices underpinning special relativity, it is known that the correlations
between causally disjoint events are “dangerous” in relativistic theories, for they can
spawn causal paradoxes: using a chain of causally disjoint events we can put two
events in the history of a given system in any chronological order whatsoever. If it
were possible to use the correlations of causally disjoint events to transfer informa-
tion either way, we would be able to communicate with the past (inside the light
cone) and thereby obtain causal paradoxes.
It can be proved (see [Bon97] and references for a detailed study) that by accepting
thestandardformulationofQMforsystemsmadebyentangledstateslike(13.81)(but
also general entangled mixed states), no piece of information can be transmitted from
(event) X, where part of the system is measured, to (event) Y, where the other part
is measured, by measuring arbitrary pairs of quantities and exploiting the quantum
correlations between the readings. Not only that, but observing the outcomes on one
part of the system we cannot establish whether on the other part any measurements
have been taken, if they are being taken as we speak, nor if they will be taken in the
future.

13.4 Compound Systems and Their Properties
855
Let us examine two ways of transferring information from X to Y via EPR cor-
relations.
(a) Consider the single pairs of measurements on A, B of the observables G A,
G B, which we know have correlated outcome. We cannot pass information from
X to Y using the correlation, because the outcome, albeit correlated, is completely
accidental. It is like having two coins A, B with the remarkable property that each
time one shows “heads”, the other one gives “tails”, independent of the fact they
are tossed far away, rapidly, and that A is tossed before or after B in some frame.
The coins, though, have a quantum character and it is physically impossible to force
one to give a certain result: the outcome of the toss is determined in a probabilistic
way and whatever our wish is. Thus the two coins, i.e. our quantum system made by
parts A and B, cannot be used as a Morse telegraph of sorts to transmit information
between X and Y.
(b) The second possibility is to consider not the single measurements of G A and
G B, but a large number thereof, and study the statistical features of the outcome
distributions. The statistics of the measurements of G A might be different according
to whether we measure G B as well, or whether we measure a new quantity G′
B.
In this way, by measuring or not measuring G B (and measuring G′
B or measuring
nothing at all) in Y, we can send an elementary signal to X, of the type “yes” or
“no”, that we recover by checking experimentally the statistics of A. We claim that
neither this procedure allows to transfer information, since the statistics relative to
G A is exactly the same in case we also measure G B (or any other G′
B) or we do
not measure G B. Consider the state ρ ∈S(HA ⊗HB) of the system composed by
A, B. Suppose G A = G(A) ⊗IB, with G(A) self-adjoint on HA, has discrete and
ﬁnite spectrum {g(A)

n }, with eigenspaces Hg(A)
k
⊂HA ⊗HB as ranges
of the orthogonal projectors P(G A)

⊗IB. Similarly, G(B) is self-adjoint
on HB, G B = IA ⊗G(B) has spectrum {g(B)

2 , . . . , g(B)
m } discrete and ﬁnite,
the eigenspaces Hg(B)

⊂HA ⊗HB are targets of orthogonal projectors P(G B)

Hence the probability of getting g(A)

The ﬁnal result is: the probability of obtaining g(A)
h
from A when the quantity B
has been measured (with any possible outcome) coincides with the probability of
obtaining g(A)
h
from A without measuring B.
So even by considering the statistics of outcomes of A, there is no way to transmit
information by EPR correlations: when measuring part B of the system, the presence
or the absence of the correlations is completely irrelevant if we observe only part A.
Therefore, Quantum Mechanics and Special Relativity seem to coexist peacefully.
In reality the above discussion turns a blind eye on whether spacetime is classical
or relativistic. Apparently, the lesson learned is that the processes of compound
quantum systems are not describable in spacetime. Only the outcomes of measure-
ments, interpreted as states of macroscopic systems (detectors, meters, etc…) can be
described in spacetime using events. Spacetime allegedly resembles an “a posteriori”
structure in which macroscopic phenomena are recorded, sometimes in relationship
to microscopic phenomena. But this is not the only possible way to look at things.
The apparent violation of locality due to the “collapse of the state” might in fact
be a purely speculative construction, related to an all-too-simplistic model of the
measuring procedures. Furthermore, a careful analysis might reveal that spacetime

categories carry on being fundamental at the quantum level as well. In this respect
see the recent study [Dop09].
13.4.6
The Phenomenon of Decoherence as a Manifestation
of the Macroscopic World
It must be clear that the point of view outlined in the previous section has to be con-
sidered as a starting point and not the end of the journey, at least until we understand,
experimentally, what a macroscopic/classical system is, what a microscopic/quantum
system is, and which are the reasons for switching from one regime to the other.
An interesting perspective for recovering the classical world from the quantum
one is based on the notion of decoherence [BGJKS00]. We present the main idea
quite rapidly (see in particular [Kup00], [Zeh00]). Consider a quantum system S
interacting with another quantum system E, the latter seen as the ambient where the
evolution takes place (E may include measurement instruments and any other object
that interacts with S). The evolution is described on the Hilbert space H = HS ⊗HE
by an operator (unitary and strongly continuous) R ∋t →Ut. If ρ(0) is a state
(mixed in general) of the total system at time t = 0, measurements of observables
on S at time t are taken using an effective statistical operator ρS(t) of the form:
ρS(t) = trE

Utρ(0)U −1
t

,
(13.89)
where trE(W) denotes the partial trace with respect to E of the self-adjoint operator
W ∈B1(HS ⊗HE) (we used it tacitly in the previous section as well). Then trE(W)
is the unique self-adjoint operator in B1(HS) for which

n∈N
(φ ⊗ψn|Wφ ⊗ψn) = (φ|trE(W)φ) ,
φ ∈HS
in any basis {ψn}n∈N ⊂HE. The role of the partial trace (for the subsystem E) is to
assign, in a natural way, a state (trE(W)) to the subsystem (S) with respect to which
the trace is not taken, whenever we have a state (W) for the total system (S + E). If
an observable A⊗IHE is bounded on S, as expected tr(AtrE(W)) = tr(A⊗IHE W).
The evolution given by (13.89), in general, cannot be expressed canonically by a
unitary evolution operator acting directly on ρS(0). This approach seems to account
well for the experimental behaviour of many systems that interact intensely with
the ambient (like macromolecules). In certain cases the interaction with the ambient
determines a collection {Pk}k∈K ⊂B(HS) of pairwise-orthogonal projectors, not
dependent on the overall state, for which almost instantaneously the state ρt satisﬁes:
ρS(t) =

k∈K
PkρS(t)Pk .

858

Selected Advanced Topics in Quantum Mechanics
Any mechanism due to the interaction of S and E that produces this situation is
called a decoherence process. In practice decoherence corresponds to a dynamical
procedure that generates a superselection rule for S, whose coherent sectors are the
projection spaces of the Pk which give propositions about quantities that are typically
considered completely classical. A mechanism of this sort (see [Kup00] and the
models therein) could shed light on the reasons why large molecules, for example,
have geometric features that vary with continuity and can be described in classical
terms. What is more, it could elucidate why certain macroscopic objects behave
classically. Perhaps it could explain, alternatively, what in the common interpretation
of the formalism goes under the name of collapse of the state (which would never
occur in reality), even though it is not clear how to justify the apparent violation of
locality [BGJKS00]. An elementary physical process leading to the superselection
of the mass, once we assume that the spectrum mass is a discrete set of positive reals,
was presented in [AnMo12].
It is worth remarking that the decoherence process is especially used to try to
describe quantum measurement procedures [BGJKS00], assuming that, even during
the interaction system-apparatus, an overall Schrödinger evolution holds. Actually,
in this case the actors are three: the system S, the environment E and the experimental
apparatus A.Thelatterisdescribedseparatelyfromtheenvironment,andisdevotedto
measuring some observable of S. Here the decoherence phenomenon should concern
the interaction A-E. It is however disputable whether these approaches really permit
to describe the notion of collapse of the state completely, hence removing it from
quantum theories.
13.4.7
Axiom A8: Compounds of Identical Systems
In QM elementary particles are identical. The fact that they cannot be distinguished
is formalised in QM in a precise way by keeping axiom A7 in account, as we will
see in a moment.
First we need a few technical results.
Deﬁnition 13.43 The permutation group Pn on n elements is the set of bijective
mapsσ : {1, 2, . . . , n} →{1, 2, . . . , n}(calledpermutationsofn objects)equipped
with the composition product.
In particular, a permutation of two objects is a map σ ∈Pn that restricts to the
identity on a subset of n −2 elements of {1, 2, . . . , n}.
To any σ ∈Pn we associate a number (−1)σ ∈{−1, +1} called its parity. If σ
is the product of an even number of permutations of two objects then (−1)σ := 1,
while if the number of permutations is odd, (−1)σ := −1. Despite the number of
permutations of two objects appearing in σ is not uniquely determined, the parity is,
as one can show.
Consider a Hilbert space H and its n-fold tensor product H⊗n := "n
i=1 H. Any σ ∈
Pn induces a unitary operator Uσ : H⊗n →H ⊗n deﬁned as follows. Pick a basis N

13.4 Compound Systems and Their Properties
859
for H. By Proposition10.25 the vectors ψ1⊗· · ·⊗ψn, with ψk ∈N, k = 1, 2, . . . , n,
form a basis of H⊗n. If σ is an arbitrary permutation also ψσ −1(1) ⊗· · ·⊗ψσ −1(n) will
give a basis for H⊗n. This basis, actually, is precisely the same one we had before
acting by σ, up to rearrangements. Deﬁne Uσ : H⊗n →H⊗n as the unique bounded
operator satisfying
Uσ(ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ψn) := ψσ −1(1) ⊗· · · ⊗ψσ −1(n) ,
ψk ∈N, k = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Then Uσ is unitary, for it preserves bases. Moreover if φ1, . . . φn ∈H are arbitrary
(even not in N), decomposing over the ψi and exploiting linearity and continuity
gives
Uσ(φ1 ⊗· · · ⊗φn) := φσ(1) ⊗· · · ⊗φσ(n) .
This proves half of the following proposition.
Proposition 13.44 Consider H⊗n := "n
i=1 H, where H is a Hilbert space, and let
Pn denote the permutation group on n elements.
(a) If σ ∈Pn there exists a unique unitary operator Uσ : H⊗n →H⊗n such that:
Uσ(φ1 ⊗· · · ⊗φn) := φσ −1(1) ⊗· · · ⊗φσ −1(n) ,
(13.90)
for any φ1, . . . , φn ∈H.
(b) U : Pn ∋σ →Uσ is a faithful unitary representation of Pn.
Proof (a) The claim descends from the arguments preceding the proposition: just
deﬁne Uσ via a basis and check (13.90) holds for any φ1, . . . , φn ∈H. Two bounded
operators satisfying (13.90) coincide on a basis, hence everywhere (being bounded).
(b) By direct inspection (using the fact that σ −1 appears in the right-hand side
of (13.90)) (UσUσ ′)(φ1 ⊗· · · ⊗φn) = Uσ◦σ ′(φ1 ⊗· · · ⊗φn). Linearity and
continuity imply UσUσ ′ = Uσ◦σ ′, making σ →Uσ a (unitary) representation
of Pn. Faithfulness is granted by the injectivity of U, since Uσ = I implies
φσ −1(1) ⊗· · ·⊗φσ −1(n) = φ1 ⊗· · ·⊗φn for any orthonormal vectors φ1, . . . , φn ∈H,
hence σ −1 = id = σ.
□
Physically,ifΨ ∈H⊗n isapurestateofasystemmadeofn identicalsubsystems,each
described on its own Hilbert space H, the pure state of UσΨ is naturally interpreted
as the state in which the n subsystems have been permuted under σ. The action of Uσ
extends to all states ρ ∈S(H⊗n) by the transformation that maps ρ to UσρU −1
σ . As
Uσ is unitary, the transformation preserves the positivity and trace of ρ (UσρU −1
σ

if ρ ∈S(H⊗n).
The permutation group’s action on states dualises to an action on propositions
P ∈L (H⊗n) on the system. The inverse dual action, as usual, is given by the trans-
formation mapping P to Uσ PU −1
σ . Since Uσ is unitary, Uσ PU −1
σ
is an orthogonal
projector if P is.
By the properties of the trace (Proposition4.38(c))

Then, this action of permutations on propositions cancels the action of permutations
on states. The natural interpretation of the transformation associating P to Uσ PU −1
σ
is an active action on physical instruments of the permutation σ. The action of Uσ
on propositions induces an action on each PVM {P(A)(E)}E∈B(R) (associated to
the observable A) that maps it to a PVM {U −1
σ P(A)(E)Uσ}E∈B(R). From the spectral
theorem we know the latter action corresponds to transforming the observable A into
Uσ AU −1
σ . The physical meaning is obvious in the light of previous considerations.
Now we are ready to state the axiom for compounds of identical systems.
A8. If a physical system S consists of n < +∞identical subsystems, each described
on one copy of the Hilbert space H, physically-admissible propositions correspond
to the subset in L (H⊗n) of orthogonal projectors that are invariant under the per-
mutation group (cf. Proposition 13.44).
Equivalently: P ∈L (H⊗n) makes physical sense on S only if
Uσ PU −1
σ
= P ,
for every σ ∈Pn.
Therefore physically-admissible observables A on S are those whose spectral mea-
sures satisfy the above condition, i.e.
Uσ AU −1
σ
= A ,
for every σ ∈Pn.
Just for example, if we work with a compound of two identical particles of mass
m, with coordinates x(1)
i
and x(2)
i , an admissible observable is the ith component of
the average position (X(1)
i
+ X(1)
i )/2. Without going into details, using the spectral
measures of X(1)
i
and X(2)
i
we can construct an admissible proposition (an orthogonal
projector commuting with every Uσ) corresponding to the statement: “one of the
particles has ith coordinate falling within the Borel set E”. Conversely, propositions
like “ particle 1 has ith coordinate falling in the Borel set E” are not admissible.
Remark 13.45 Referring to the notion of gauge group presented in Deﬁnition11.23,
we conclude that the von Neumann algebra R of a system of n identical systems is a
subalgebra of B(H×n) admitting a non-Abelian commutant R′ whose gauge group
contains the representation {Uσ}σ∈Pn.
■
13.4.8
Bosons and Fermions
At last, we would like to show one consequence of axiom A8 that is worthy of
mention. Consider the usual system S made of n identical subsystems. Take σ ∈Pn
and the λ-eigenspace of Uσ inside H⊗n:
(H⊗n)(σ)
λ
:= {Ψ ∈H⊗n | UσΨ = λΨ } .

13.4 Compound Systems and Their Properties
861
Note Uσ is unitary, so |λ| = 1.
Every meaningful proposition must commute with Uσ, so if the system’s state
Ψ ∈(H⊗n)(σ)
λ
is initially pure, following a measurement by the admissible (true)
proposition P the state will be described by PΨ/||PΨ ||; this is in (H⊗n)(σ)
λ
since
Uσ
PΨ
||PΨ || = Uσ PΨ
||PΨ || = PUσ Ψ
||PΨ || = λ
PΨ
||PΨ ||. By taking measurements, therefore, we cannot
“make the system leave” the space (H⊗n)(σ)
λ
if it was in a pure state described by a
vector in (H⊗n)(σ)
λ
immediately prior to the measurement. Not even time evolution,
at least under time homogeneity, “allows the system to leave” the space (H⊗n)(σ)
λ
if it was, at the initial time, in a pure state in (H⊗n)(σ)
λ . In fact, the Hamiltonian
observable H (being admissible) will have spectral measure that commutes with Uσ.
Consequently
e−it HUσ =

σ(H)
e−ih d P(H)(h)Uσ = Uσ

σ(H)
e−ih d P(H)(h) = Uσe−it H .
If UσΨ = λΨ , then UσΨt = Uσe−it HΨ = e−it HUσΨ = e−it HλΨ = λΨt, so Ψt ∈
(H⊗n)(σ)
λ , for any time t ∈R. In case the evolution operator is not the exponential of
the Hamiltonian (lack of time homogeneity), under suitable assumptions one can still
prove the same result. This happens if, for instance, the evolution operator is given
by the Dyson series (see Proposition13.19) for a special class of time-dependent
Hamiltonian observables. We have the following result.
Proposition 13.46 Suppose a compound system S is made of n < +∞identical
subsystems, each described on the same Hilbert space H, and at some time t0 the
system is in a pure state represented by a vector in (H⊗n)(σ)
λ
for some σ ∈Pn. Then
the evolution (in regime of time homogeneity), or a measurement, leaves the system
in a pure state represented by a vector in (H⊗n)(σ)
λ .
The experimental evidence not only conﬁrms this fact, but shows that pure states
of a compound of identical particles in 4 dimensions (three for space plus time)
are determined by vectors in two subspaces only, built intersecting the (H⊗n)(σ)
λ . To
explain that fact we need a few comments.
Consider a permutation δ ∈Pn of two elements, so δ ◦δ = id and UδUδ = I.
As Uδ is unitary, Uδ is self-adjoint. Hence Uδ is an observable, actually a constant
of motion (exercise). Not just that: σ(Uδ) ⊂{−1, 1} because σ(Uδ) is contained
in R (Uδ is self-adjoint) and also in the unit circle in C (Uδ is unitary). Therefore
σ(Uδ) = σp(Uδ) because the spectrum consists of one or two isolated points. It is
easy to prove σp(Uδ) = {−1, 1}. In fact, if δ swaps the kth and jth elements, every
vector of H⊗n of the form
(ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ψk ⊗· · · ⊗ψ j ⊗· · · ⊗ψn) ± (ψ1 ⊗· · · ⊗ψ j ⊗· · · ⊗ψk ⊗· · · ⊗ψn)
is an eigenvector of Uδ with eigenvalue ±1. From this follows, for any σ ∈Pn, that
Uσ admits the eigenvalues (possibly coinciding) 1 and (−1)σ. It is enough to write
Uσ = Uδ1 · · · Uδm, where the σi are permutations of two elements. The intersections

862

+ := ∩m
i=1(H⊗n)(δi)
+1
and (H⊗n)(σ)
−:= ∩m
i=1(H⊗n)(δi)
−1
are eigenspaces for Uσ with respective eigenvalues +1 and (−1)σ, since Uσ =
Uδ1 · · · Uδm.
The space H⊗n has two physically interesting and mutually-orthogonal closed sub-
spaces, obtained from the intersections of all spaces of type (H⊗n)(σ)
+ and (H⊗n)(σ)
−,
respectively, as σ ∈Pn varies. These are the totally symmetric product
(H⊗n)+ := {Ψ ∈H⊗n | UσΨ = Ψ , ∀σ ∈Pn}
and the totally skew-symmetric product
(H⊗n)−:= {Ψ ∈H⊗n | UσΨ = (−1)σΨ , ∀σ ∈Pn} .
The physical relevance of these subspaces lies in that every known compound of iden-
tical particles has pure states described by vectors either in (H⊗n)+ or in (H⊗n)−.
Particles of the ﬁrst type, called bosons (whose mixtures are incoherent superposi-
tions of pure states in (H⊗n)+), have integer spin; particles of the second type (whose
mixtures are incoherent superpositions of pure states in (H⊗n)−), called fermions,
have semi-integer spin. This phenomenon is often referred to as the spin statistical
correlation.
Remark 13.47 Notice that the restrictions of the representation Pn ∋σ →Uσ :
H⊗n →H⊗n to these invariant subspaces are Abelian representations. So if we
deal with systems of identical subsystems whose Hilbert space is either (H⊗n)(σ)
+ or
(H⊗n)(σ)
−, i.e. either bosons or fermions, the gauge group of the algebra of observables
is still Abelian.
■
Within the non-relativistic formulation of QM there is no proof for the relationship
to the value of spin. We can only show, using Proposition13.46, that if a system of
particles has a fermionic or a bosonic behaviour, at time t0, it will maintain the
behaviour so long it is described by pure states.
In the non-relativistic formulation there are states represented by vectors that,
in principle, are neither symmetric nor skew-symmetric and belong to a subspace
H′ of H⊗n = (H⊗n)+ ⊕(H⊗n)−⊕H′ orthogonal to both (H⊗n)±. This subspace
is again invariant under measurement procedures and temporal evolution and, obvi-
ously, under the unitary representation of the permutation group Pn. Actually H′
can be decomposed into a direct sum of subspaces of dimension ≥2 which are
separately invariant under the algebra of observables, time evolution, and the action
of the permutation group. What we are discussing refers to each of these subspaces.
In the jargon, one says that elementary physical systems (particles) admitting such
vector states obey a parastatistics. Particles of this sort have never been observed. It
is however theoretically interesting to notice that a physical system made of identical
subsystems described on H′ cannot admit complete sets of commuting observables
(Deﬁnition11.11). (This is because the existence of a maximal observable would

13.4 Compound Systems and Their Properties
863
imply that the commutant of the algebra of observables is commutative by Proposi-
tion11.12, while the commutant of the von Neumann algebra of observables relative
to the invariant carrier space H′ contains a unitary representation of Pn which can-
not be commutative. This representation is the restriction to H′ of the overall unitary
faithful representation Pn ∋σ →Uσ : H⊗n →H⊗n. The restriction to the invari-
ant subspaces (H⊗n)± is trivially commutative. If it were commutative also when
restricted to the remaining invariant subspace H′, it would be commutative on the
whole H⊗n, but we know that it is not the case since the overall representation is
faithful and Pn is not Abelian.) A consequence of the fact that the commutant of
the algebra of observables restricted to H′ is not trivial is that the one-to-one corre-
spondence between pure states and rays no longer holds. Indeed, if V is a unitary
non-trivial element of the commutant of the algebra of observables in H′, it is impos-
sible to distinguish Ψ and Ψ ′ = V Ψ by means of measurement procedures. (This
fact does not apply to (H⊗n)± because the representation of Pn there is just given
in terms of global phases.)
Passing to relativistic formulations of QM – more precisely the Relativistic Quan-
tum Field Theory on 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime – many authors (mainly
W. Pauli) obtained a famous theorem, aptly called spin statistical correlation theorem
[StWi00]. It proves that the restriction on pure states and the spin statistical correla-
tion observed experimentally are consequences of the theory’s invariance under the
Poincaré group, rather than the Galilean group. In three-dimensional spacetime mod-
els there are compounds of identical particles that do not abide by Fermi’s statistics,
nor Bose’s.
Remark 13.48 Axiom A8 imposes constraints on the observables of a system of
identical particles. One may adopt a physically much more rigid, quite unmotivated,
but very popular, point of view by focusing on vectors instead observables. The
requirement is that
a normalized vector Ψ ∈H⊗n represents a state if and only if the associated ray is
ﬁxed under the action of permutations and the arbitrary phase does not depend on
the representative vector: UσΨ = λσΨ for every σ ∈Pn and some λσ ∈C with
|λσ| = 1.
This stronger version of A8 implies that only vectors in (H⊗n)+ and (H⊗n)+ can
be admitted to represent states, ruling out any parastatistics (Exercise13.6).

In conclusion we mention that when we deal with compounds of inﬁnitely many
identical subsystems described on H, the natural Hilbert spaces to develop the theory
are the subspaces of the Fock space (Example10.27(3)):

(Hn⊗)−,
called the bosonic Fock space and fermionic Fock space generated by H. As usual
we assumed (H0⊗)± := C, and that the unique pure state determined by (H0⊗)± is
the vacuum state of the system. This is the framework of Quantum Field Theory,

Prove ρ′ is well deﬁned and ρ′ ∈S(H).
Hint. Pk Ph = 0 if k ̸= h, s-
k Pk = I, and ||ρ2|| ≤1. This allows to prove the

That ρ′ is positive and ||ρ′|| ≤1 follows by the construction and the similar
properties of ρ. Using the basis N of H made by the union of bases for each summand
Hk, with Proposition4.31 one proves ρ′ is of trace class, plus trρ′ = trρ = 1.
13.2 In Sect.13.4.5 it was shown that the probability of measuring g(A)

13.3 Referring to (13.90) prove that UσUσ ′ = Uσ◦σ ′.
Solution. By linearity, and exploiting the fact that the operators are bounded and
deﬁned everywhere, it is sufﬁcient proving that
Uσ(Uσ ′(φ1 ⊗. . . ⊗φn)) = Uσ◦σ ′(φ1 ⊗. . . ⊗φn) .
Let us establish that identity. If σ, σ ′ ∈Pn then:
Uσ(Uσ ′(φ1 ⊗. . . ⊗φn)) = Uσ(φσ ′−1(1) ⊗. . . ⊗φσ ′−1(n)) .
Redeﬁning ui := φσ ′−1(i) so that uσ −1( j) := φσ ′−1(σ −1( j)), one ﬁnds

13.4 Compound Systems and Their Properties

13.4 Consider a compound of n identical particles in H⊗n. Prove that under axiom
A8, if δ ∈Pn is a permutation on two elements, then Uδ is a constant of motion.
13.5 Prove that (H⊗n)+ and (H⊗n)−are orthogonal, that H⊗2 = (H⊗2)+ ⊕(H⊗2)−
if n = 2, and that the previous fact is false already for n = 3.
13.6 Prove that if Ψ ∈H⊗n represents a pure state and UσΨ = λσΨ , with |λσ| = 1,
for every σ ∈Pn, then either Ψ ∈(H⊗n)−or Ψ ∈(H⊗n)+.
Solution. Consider a permutation of two elements j, k in {1, . . . , n}, indicated by
( j, k) ∈Pn. Hence
( j, k) = (2, k) ◦(1, j) ◦(1, 2) ◦(2, k) ◦(1, j) .
On the other hand U(p,q)Ψ = λ(p,q)Ψ with λ(p,q) = ±1, since U(p,q)U(p,q) = I
because (p, q)2 = id, for every choice of p and q. Therefore, assuming Ψ ̸= 0,
λ( j,k) = λ(2,k)λ(1, j)λ(1,2)λ(2,k)λ(1, j) = λ(1,2) .
We conclude that, for every permutation of two elements δ ∈Pn,
UδΨ = λ(1,2)Ψ .
Hence, by the deﬁnition of (−1)σ stated below Deﬁnition13.43, and setting 1σ := 1,
UσΨ = λσ
(1,2)Ψ ,
σ ∈Pn .
Therefore if λ(1,2) = 1 then Ψ ∈(H⊗n)+; if λ(1,2) = −1, then Ψ ∈(H⊗n)−.
13.7 Assume that, for a system of n identical particles, the vectors representing
states deﬁne a closed subspace K ⊂H⊗n and satisfy UσΨ = λΨ,σΨ , where now
λΨ,σ may also depend on Ψ . Prove that K is a subspace of either (H⊗n)−or (H⊗n)+
provided its dimension is ≥2.
Outline of the solution. If Ψ,  ∈K are orthogonal and have unit norm, the
linearity of Uσ entails λ(Ψ +)/
√
2,σ = λΨ,σ = λ,σ =: λσ. Therefore Uσ is repre-
sented by λσ along the vectors of an orthonormal basis of K, that is: Uσ|K = λσ I.
By applying Exercise13.6 one concludes the proof.

Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation
of Quantum Theories
I would like to make a confession which may seem immoral: I do
not believe absolutely in Hilbert spaces any more.
von Neumann, letter to Birkhoff about the mathematical
formulation of QM (1935)
In the last chapter of the book we offer a short presentation of the algebraic for-
mulation of quantum theories, and we will state and prove a central theorem about
the so-called GNS construction. We will discuss how to treat the notion of quantum
symmetry in this framework, by showing that an algebraic quantum symmetry can
be implemented (anti-)unitarily in GNS representations of states invariant under the
symmetry.
As general references, mostly concerned with the algebraic formulation of Quan-
tum Field Theories, we recall [Emc72, Haa96, Ara09, Rob04, BDFY15] and the
more recent [Str05a, Str12] on the algebraic formulation of QM. On the mathematical
side, detailed and critical studies on the present material are [BrRo02, KaRi97].
We will routinely resort to Deﬁnition 3.52 throughout the chapter.

Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation
of Quantum Theories
The fundamental Theorem 11.43 of Stone-von Neumann is stated in the jargon of
theoretical physics as follows:
“all irreducible representations of the CCRs with a ﬁnite, and ﬁxed, number of
freedom degrees are unitarily equivalent,”.
The expression unitarily equivalent refers to the existence of a Hilbert-space
isomorphism S, and the ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom is the dimension of the
symplectic space X on which the Weyl algebra is built.

Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
What happens then in inﬁnite dimensions? Let us keep irreducibility, and suppose
we pass from X ﬁnite-dimensional – parametrising, e.g., the coordinates of a point-
particle in phase space – to X inﬁnite-dimensional – describing a suitable solution
space to free bosonic ﬁeld equations, say. Then the Stone–von Neumann theorem no
longer holds. Theoretical physicists would say that
“there exist non-equivalent irreducible CCR representations with an inﬁnite num-
ber of freedom degrees”.
What happens in this situation, in practice, is that one can ﬁnd strongly continuous
irreduciblerepresentationsπ1,π2,on(separable)HilbertspacesH1,H2,oftheWeyl ∗-
algebra A := W (X, σ) (here thought of as C∗-algebra, with no change in the results)
associated to the physical system under exam (a quantised bosonic ﬁeld, typically),
that admit no isomorphism S : H1 →H2 satisfying:
Sπ1(a) S−1 = π2(a) ,
for any a ∈A.
Pairs of this kind are called (unitarily) non-equivalent. Jumping from X ﬁnite-
dimensional to inﬁnite-dimensional corresponds to passing from Quantum Mechan-
ics to Quantum Field Theory (relativistic QFT, possibly, and on curved spacetime
[Wal94, KhMo15, FeVe15]). In these situations (but not only), the existence of non-
equivalent representations has often to do with spontaneous symmetry breaking. The
presence of non-equivalent representations of a single physical system (X, σ) shows
that a formulation in a ﬁxed Hilbert space is completely inadequate, and we must
free ourselves of the Hilbert structure in order to lay the foundations of quantum the-
ories in broader generality (an interesting and detailed technical analysis of several
problems with the Hilbert-space formulation, based on concrete models of quantum
ﬁelds and statistical mechanics’ systems, can be found in [Emc72, Sect.1, Chap. 1]).
This programme has been developed by and large, starting from the pioneering
work of von Neumann himself, and is nowadays called algebraic formulation of
Quantum (Field) Theories. Within this framework it was possible to formalise, for
example, ﬁeld theories on curved spacetime in relationship to the quantum phenom-
enology of black-hole thermodynamics.
14.1.1
Algebraic Formulation
The algebraic formulation prescinds, anyway, from the nature of the quantum sys-
tem, and may be stated for systems with ﬁnitely many freedom degrees as well
[Str05a]. The viewpoint falls back on two assumptions [Haa96, Ara09, Str05a, Str12,
BDFY15] (which somehow generalise the results of Sect.7.6.5).
AA1. A physical system S is described by its observables, viewed now as self-adjoint
elements in a certain C∗-algebra ASwith unit I associated to S.

14.1 Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
869
AA2. An algebraic state on AS is a linear functional ω : AS →C such that:
ω(a∗a) ≥0 ∀a ∈AS,
ω(I) = 1 ,
that is, positive and normalised to 1.
We have to stress that AS is not seen as a concrete C∗-algebra of operators on
a given Hilbert space, but remains an abstract C∗-algebra. Physically, ω(a) is the
expectation value of the observable a ∈A in state ω.
Remark 14.1 (1) AS is usually called the algebra of observables of S though, prop-
erly speaking, the observables are the self-adjoint elements of AS only.
(2) We can assign AS to S irrespective of any reference frame, provided we assume
that the (active) transformations of the various frames are given by automorphisms
of AS. If the algebra depends on the frame, the time evolution with respect to the
given frame is described by a one-parameter group of ∗-automorphisms {αt}t∈R,
where αt : AS →AS is a ∗-homomorphism for any t ∈R, α0 is the identity and
αt ◦αt′ = αt+t′ for t, t′ ∈R. It is natural to demand weak continuity in t: for every
state ω on As, the map R ∋t 
→ω(αt(a)) is continuous for every a ∈AS.
In case the algebra of observables is independent of the reference frame, AS is
actually thought of as a net of algebras: it will be described by a function O 
→AS(O)
mapping to an algebra AS(O) any regular bounded region O in spacetime (extending
both in the space and time directions). From this point of view time evolution is
replaced by causal relations between algebras localised at spacetime regions that are
causally related, in particular when one region belongs to another’s future. The above
approach, thoroughly discussed for the ﬁrst time in the crucial paper of Haag and
Kastler [HaKa64], is the modern stepping stone to develop algebraic ﬁeld theory in
the local covariant formulation.
(3) It is important to emphasise that, differently form the Hilbert space formula-
tion, the algebraic approach can be adopted to describe both classical and quantum
systems. The two cases are distinguished on the base of the commutativity of the
algebra of observables AS. A commutative algebra is assumed to describe a classical
system, whereas a noncommutative one is supposed to be associated with a quantum
system.

14.1.2
Motivations and Relevance of Lie-Jordan Algebras
Before going on with the mathematical technology, a brief discussion about the
motivations underlying the algebraic formulation may be useful. In the rest of this
subsection, whose content is quite heuristic, we shall denote the observables with
capital letters A, B, . . . and use corresponding small letters a, b, . . . to denote the
values attained by the observables.

Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
The most evident, a posteriori, justiﬁcation of the algebraic approach lies in its
powerfulness [Haa96]. There have been a host of attempts to account for assumptions
AA1 and AA2 and their physical meaning, in full generality (see the study of [Emc72,
Ara09, Str05a, Str12] and especially the work of I. E. Segal [Seg47] based on Jordan
algebras), yet none seems to be deﬁnitive [Stre07].
There are at least two interrelated basic issues to consider when attempting to
justify assumptions AA1 and AA2 physically.
(a) The identiﬁcation of the notions of state and expectation value.
This identiﬁcation would be natural within the Hilbert space formulation, where
the class of observables includes elementary observables, which are represented by
orthogonal projectors and correspond to “yes-no” statements. The expectation value
of one such observable coincides with the probability that the outcome of the mea-
surement is “yes”. The set of all those probabilities deﬁnes, in fact, a quantum state
of the system, as we know. The analogues of these elementary propositions, however,
generally do not belong to the C∗-algebra of observables in the algebraic formula-
tion (see Sect.14.1.6). Even so, this obstruction is not insurmountable. Following
[Ara09], in a completely general physical system the most general notion of state ω
would be the assignment of all probabilities w(A)
ω (a) that the outcome of measuring
the observable A is a, for all observables A and all values a. On the other hand, it is
known [Str05a] that all experimental information on the measurement of A in state
ω – the probabilities w(A)
ω (a) in particular – is recorded in the expectation values
of the polynomials of A. Here, we should think of p(A) as the observable whose
values are given by the p(a), for all values a of A. This characterisation of an observ-
able is theoretically supported by the various solutions to the momentum problem
in probability theory. To adopt this paradigm, therefore, we have to assume that the
set of observables must include all real polynomials p(A) whenever it contains the
observable A. This is in agreement with the much stronger requirement AA1.
We stress that, within the algebraic formulation, it is natural to suppose that the
full set of observables and the whole set of states together encompass the maxi-
mum amount of information available on the physical system we are studying. As a
byproduct of this assumption and of the identiﬁcation of the notion of state with that
of expectation value, we are committed to conclude that, in our formalism:
(i) states separate observables: two observables A, B coincide if and only the
corresponding expectation values coincide: A = B ⇔ω(A) = ω(B) for all states
ω;
(ii) observables separate states: two states ω, ω′ coincide if and only if the corre-
sponding expectation values coincide: ω = ω′ ⇔ω(A) = ω′(A) for all observables
A.
As a matter of fact, AA1 and AA2 theoretically support these two statements.
Indeed, (ii) follows immediately from the fact that a state is a linear functional on
the C∗-algebra AS and that every element (also not self-adjoint) of AS is a linear
combination of self-adjoint elements representing observables. Assertion (i) is a
straightforward consequence of the Gelfand-Najmark theorem, as we shall see in
Corollary 14.30.

14.1 Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
871
(b) The incarnation of observables as a C∗-algebra.
Whilst the nature and the physical meaning of the associative product of the algebra,
in particular, is difﬁcult to justify a priori, the assumption on the boundedness of
observables in a suitable norm does not seem so hard to clarify from an operational
point of view [Str05a]. An observable A is deﬁned in terms of a concrete experimental
apparatus, which yields the numerical results of measurements in any state ω. Since
each concrete experimental apparatus has inevitable limitations that imply a scale
bound independent of the state on which measurements are performed, the result of
measurements of A on the various states is a bounded set of real numbers, whose
bound is related to the scale bound of the associated experimental apparatus. It is
then natural to associate to each observable A a ﬁnite bound (in perfect agreement
with the theoretical result of Corollary 14.30):
||A|| := sup
ω∈
|ω(A)| < +∞
(14.1)
where  is the set of all possible states. As the notation suggests, this bound can be
interpreted as a norm, once we have built the algebraic structure of the observables
(see [Str05a] for details). Let us next focus on the purely algebraic features of the
space of observables, the associative algebra of product in particular. In this respect
we can observe that, actually, a weaker form of AA1 must certainly be true. As
already noticed, if p is a real polynomial and A is an observable (so that the possible
values a are real numbers), p(A) is a well-deﬁned object and it is an observable
as well. As we said p(A) is nothing but the observable whose values are p(a), for
all values a of A. If p is complex, p(A) deserves the same operative interpretation
since its real and imaginary parts are observables. All this indicates the existence, for
every observable A, of a natural structure of a commutative ∗-algebra on complex
polynomials p(A). The involution here is the obvious one p(A)∗:= p(A). It is not
difﬁcult to prove that (14.1) turns out to be a norm for this ∗-algebra.
Following the same route of Sect.11.3.2, objects like real linear combinations
αA + βB of observables can be made physically meaningful even if A and B cannot
measured simultaneously: αA + βB is the observable whose expectation values ver-
ifyω(αA + βB) = αω(A) + βω(B)for everystate ω.Noticethat,fromthephysical
point of view, we are enlarging the class of observables, for we are assuming that
new observables verifying the previous constraint exist (and thus they are uniquely
determined, since their expectation values are known). The extension to complex
combinations is now straightforward. All that on the one hand justiﬁes the appear-
ance of a complex vector space structure, equipped with an antilinear bijective and
involutive operation (extending the previous one), (αA + βB)∗:= αA + βB, and
with a norm that extends (14.1), as is not difﬁcult to prove. This structure becomes a
fully ﬂedged normed ∗-algebra if the construction is supplemented by an associative
product, that extends the one deﬁned in each algebra of polynomials p(A) generated
by any ﬁxed element A. On the other hand, the procedure gives rise to a generally
non-distributive and non-associative Jordan product (see Sect.11.3.2 and Deﬁnition
11.29):

,
(14.2)
where (A + B)2, A2 and B2 are well deﬁned as indicated above.
However, similarly to what happens in the Hilbert space formulation, if p denotes
a general polynomial with two entries, and A and B are observables that cannot be
measured simultaneously (see Sect.11.3.2), the interpretation of p(A, B) turns out
to be very difﬁcult. Certainly, the product of the C∗-algebra of AA1 provides a sound
mathematical meaningto p(A, B),thoughtitdoes notelucidatethe physical meaning
of p(A, B) in terms of A and B. That said, it is difﬁcult to justify the existence
of a C∗-algebra product in the complex vector space of extended observables, even
assuming the existence of a meaningful Jordan product and norm [Str05a]. Necessary
and sufﬁcient conditions have been found (e.g., see [AlSc03]) for the existence
of a C∗-algebra structure that completes the algebraic and topological structures
outlined above. However the physical interpretation of these conditions does not
seem transparent. (Sect.2, Chap. 1 of [Emc72] contains a deep study on the Jordan-
algebra induced C∗-structure, and the many steps involved are analysed thoroughly.)
Another, much stronger, possibility is to assume – without any true physical
justiﬁcation – that the real linear space of observables is also equipped with a Lie-
algebra structure of pure quantum nature (the Lie bracket [A, B] is proportional to
the Planck constant), and that the two products enjoy the properties below.
Deﬁnition 14.2 A (real) Jordan algebra A) (Deﬁnition 11.29) equipped with a Lie
bracket { , } is called (real) Lie-Jordan algebra when, for a constant c ∈R, it
satisﬁes:
(A ◦B) ◦C −A ◦(B ◦C) = c
4{{A, C}, B} for all A, B, C ∈A.
(14.3)
and furthermore the Leibniz rule is valid:
{A, B ◦C} = {A, B} ◦C + {A, C} ◦B
for all A, B, C ∈A.
(14.4)
From the physical side, in our context it is natural to assume c = ℏ2. Moreover,
if we look at the Hamiltonian formulations of classical physics for instance, { , }
could be interpreted as the quantum analogue of the Poisson bracket. In other words
the Lie bracket should be understood as the standard commutator of (self-adjoint)
observables multiplied by iℏ, in accordance with a version of Dirac’s correspondence
principle (see Sect.11.5.8).
A posteriori, the Lie-Jordan structure arises quite naturally when one knows that
(complexiﬁed) observables form a ∗-algebra. In fact, given a complex ∗-algebra, by
deﬁning the Lie bracket in terms of the standard commutator as:
{ , } := i
ℏ[ , ]
(14.5)

14.1 Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
873
and setting
A ◦B = 1
2 (AB + B A) ,
(14.6)
one ﬁnds a natural real Lie-Jordan algebra when restricting to the real space of
self-adjoint elements. In particular:
AB = A ◦B + iℏ
2 {A, B} for all A, B, C ∈A.
(14.7)
Taking (14.6) into account, that is the same as:
AB = A ◦B + 1
2[A, B] for all A, B, C ∈A .
(14.8)
Theprocedurewehaveoutlinedcanbereversedifweassumethatobservablespossess
a Lie-Jordan structure. Given a real Lie-Jordan algebra A with c = ℏ2, requiring
(14.5) produces an associative complex ∗-algebra. We can perform this on A1 :=
C ⊗A: the involution ∗is (a ⊗A)∗:= a ⊗A for every a ∈C and A ∈A, and the
associative product is given by extending (14.8) C-linearly.
It is important to notice that the Lie-Jordan algebra structure can be equipped
with a natural norm. After completion, this will generate an associated C∗-algebra
[AlSc03].
Coming back to physics, it is ﬁnally worth stressing that with this formulation
both the non-commutativity and non-associativity underlying the algebra of observ-
ables appear to have a quantum nature, and seem to realise quantum deformations of
classical structures, in the sense that commutativity and associativity are restored as
soon as ℏ→0. However, a relic of quantum non-commutativity remains in the Pois-
son bracket even at classical level. As a matter of fact, the picture we have described
can be developed further. The (algebraic) deformation quantisation procedure, intro-
duced in Sect.11.5.8, starts by assuming that (14.7) is just the ﬁrst-order expansion
in ℏof the quantum product. This approach has been exploited in algebraic Quan-
tum Field Theory in a modern and powerful fashion to reformulate the perturbative
interacting theory, including the renormalisation procedure [BrFr09].
14.1.3
The GNS Reconstruction Theorem
The set of algebraic states on AS is a convex subset in the dual A′
S of AS: if ω1 and
ω2 are positive and normalised linear functionals, ω = λω1 + (1 −λ)ω2 is clearly
still positive and normalised, for any λ ∈[0, 1].
Hence, just as we saw for the standard formulation, we can deﬁne pure algebraic
states as extreme elements of the convex body.

Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
Deﬁnition 14.3 An algebraic state ω : A →C on the unital C∗-algebra A is called
a pure algebraic state if it is extreme in the set of algebraic states. An algebraic
state that is not pure is called mixed.
Later we will show that the space of states is non-empty and compact in the ∗-weak
topology. Consequently, pure states exist.
Surprisingly, most of the abstract apparatus given by a C∗-algebra and a set of
states admits elementary Hilbert space representations once a reference algebraic
state has been ﬁxed. This is by virtue of a famous procedure Gelfand, Najmark and
Segal came up with, that we present below [Haa96, Ara09, Str05a].
Theorem 14.4 (GNS theorem) Let A be a C∗-algebra with unit I and ω : A →C
a positive linear functional with ω(I) = 1. Then
(a) there exist a triple (Hω, πω, 	ω), where Hω is a Hilbert space, πω : A →B(Hω)
a A-representation over Hω and 	ω ∈Hω, such that:
(i) 	ω is cyclic for πω: the invariant subspace Dω := πω(A)	ω is dense in Hω;
(ii) (	ω|πω(a)	ω) = ω(a) for every a ∈A.
(b) If (H, π, 	) satisﬁes (i) and (ii), there exists a unitary operator U : Hω →H
such that 	 = U	ω and π(a) = Uπω(a)U −1 for any a ∈A.
Proof (a) For a start we will build the Hilbert space. We will refer to the elementary
theory of Hilbert spaces of Chap.3. Let us deﬁne the quadratic form ⟨x, y⟩ω :=
ω(x∗y), x, y ∈A. This is a Hermitian semi-inner product by the requests made on
ω, so for the seminorm pω(x) := √⟨x, x⟩ω the Schwarz inequality
ω(x∗y) ≤

ω(x∗x)

ω(y∗y)
(14.9)
holds. Consider now the set Iω := {x ∈A | pω(x) = 0}. Since pω is a seminorm,
by (14.9) Iω is a subspace of A. As the symbol suggests, Iω is a left ideal in A, i.e.
a subspace such that yx ∈Iω for any x ∈Iω, y ∈A. In fact by (14.9):
0 ≤pω(yx)4 = ω(x∗y∗yx)2 ≤ω(y∗yxx∗y∗y)ω(x∗x) = 0 .
Hence we may deﬁne the vector space Dω := A/Iω, quotient of A by the ideal
Iω. The elements of Dω are thus cosets [x] for the equivalence relation A: x ∼y
⇔x −y ∈Iω. The vector space structure is naturally inherited by A, and makes
α[x] + β[y] := [αx + βy] meaningful,1 for any α, β ∈C, x, y ∈A. That Iω is a
subspace guarantees the structure is well deﬁned. Since Iω is also the left ideal
of zeroes of the seminorm associated to the semi-inner product ⟨, ⟩ω, as we just
showed,
([x] |[y])ω := ⟨x, y⟩ω
∀x, y ∈A
(14.10)
1Notice that there is no identity like [ab] = [a][b] in this construction. Only the linear structure,
not the algebra, is constructed on the quotient.

is a well-deﬁned Hermitian inner product on Dω. Introduce the Hilbert completion
Hω of Dω for the inner product, which we continue to indicate with (14.10) on the
entire Hω. The representation πω is deﬁned in the natural way on the dense subspace
Dω = A/Iω ⊂Hω as:
(πω(a))([b]) := [ab] .
(14.11)
Then Dω is by construction invariant under every πω(a). At last, let 	ω := [I]. As
a ∈A varies, the sets πω(a)	ω = [a] ﬁll the dense space Dω. Therefore 	ω is cyclic,
as needed. It is easy to see that, by construction, A ∋a 
→πω(a) is linear on the
dense domain Dω (hence it has an adjoint) and satisﬁes, for any a, b, c ∈A, μ ∈C:
(i) πω(a)πω(b) = πω(ab),
(ii) πω(a) + πω(b) = πω(a + b),
(iii) μπω(a) = πω(μa),
(iv) (πω(b)	ω |πω(a)πω(c)	ω )ω = (πω(a∗)πω(b)	ω |πω(c)	ω )ω.
The last fact, equivalent to
πω(a)∗↾Dω= πω(a∗) ,
follows by
(πω(b)	ω |πω(a)πω(c)	ω )ω = ([b] |[ac])ω = ω(b∗ac) = ω

ω = (πω(a∗)πω(b)	ω|πω(c)	ω)ω .
By construction, for a ∈A:
ω(a) = ω(I∗aI) = ([I]|[a][I])ω = (	ω |πω(a)	ω )ω .
(14.12)
To ﬁnish (a) it is enough to prove that every operator πω(a) : Dω →Hω is bounded,
so it extends uniquely to a bounded operator on Hω, because Dω ⊂Hω is dense. We
will call the extended operators with the same names πω(a). Therefore properties
(i)–(iv) will still be valid, by continuity. In particular, the operators being bounded,
(iv) implies πω(a)∗= πω(a∗). It is obvious that πω(I) = I and so the map πω : A →
B(Hω) will be a ∗-representation.
To prove the boundedness of the πω(a), we begin by showing ω is continuous. We
will only assume that the linear functional ω is positive, without using ω(I) = 1. If
h ∈A is normal, since |σ(h)| ≤||h|| by the features of the spectral radius, Theorem
8.36(c) gives σ(h ± ||h||I) ≥0. By Theorem 8.25, h ± ||h||I = c∗c, so the positivity
andlinearityofω allowstosayω(h) ± ||h||ω(I) ≥0,meaning|ω(h)| ≤ω(I)||h||.In
turn this implies ω is a bounded linear functional. In fact, if y ∈A is any element, y∗y
is self-adjoint and so normal. Using the above result gives immediately |ω(y∗y)| ≤
ω(I)||y∗y||. Finally, (14.9) with x = I says
|ω(y)|4 ≤ω(I)2 ||y∗y||2 = (ω(I)||y||)2 ,

Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
hence ||ω|| ≤ω(I). On the other hand, from |ω(I)| = ω(I) and ||I|| = 1 we have
||ω|| = ω(I) .
In our case, as ω(I) = 1, we obtain ||ω|| = 1.
If ω(x∗x) > 0 we can repeat the argument for the linear functional
A ∋z 
→ρ(z) := ω(x∗zx)
ω(x∗x) ,
by construction linear, positive and such that ρ(I) = 1; therefore ||ρ|| = ρ(I) = 1.
We conclude that the state ω satisﬁes
ω(x∗y∗yx) ≤||y∗y||ω(x∗x) ,
holding also when ω(x∗x) = 0 because the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality forces 0 ≤
ω(x∗y∗yx) = ω((x∗y∗y)x) ≤√ω((x∗y∗y)∗(x∗y∗y))√ω(x∗x). Consequently
||(πω(y))([x])||ω = ||[yx]||ω =

ω(x∗y∗yx) ≤

||y∗y||

ω(x∗x) ≤||y|| ||[x]||ω ,
and so ||πω(y)|| ≤||y||. This ends part (a).
(b) Just asking Uπω(a)	ω := π(a)	 for any a ∈A determines a densely-deﬁned
isometric operator, which we call U. This is well deﬁned because πω(a)	ω =
πω(a′)	ω implies π(a)	 = π(a′)	, as is evident from
||π(a −a′)	||2 = ω((a −a′)∗(a −a′)) = ||πω(a −a′)	ω||2
ω .
For the same reason U is isometric:
||Uπω(a)	ω||2 = ||π(a)	||2 = ω(a∗a) = ||πω(a)	ω||2
ω .
Hence we can extend U to a continuous isometric operator on H with the same
name. Similarly, let us construct an isometric operator V : H →Hω as the unique
continuousextensionof V π(a)	 = πω(a)	ω.Bycontinuity,andusingthedensityof
π(A)	, we have UV  =  for every  ∈H. Therefore U is onto, beside isometric,
and so unitary. That 	 = U	ω and π(a) = Uπω(a)U −1, a ∈A, are obvious by
construction.
□
The GNS theorem shows that given an algebraic state, the observables of A are still
represented by (bounded) self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space Hω, where the
expectation value of ω takes the usual form (	ω|π(a)	ω) with respect to a reference
vector 	ω. The latter vector allows to recover the whole Hilbert space by means of
the representation πω itself, as we said in the GNS theorem (a), part (i). However
the reader should notice that not all algebraic states on A are represented by positive
trace-class operators on Hω, as we shall discuss shortly.

14.1 Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
877
The representation πω need not be injective, i.e. faithful. From the proof and
(14.11) with b = I in particular, we immediately have
Proposition 14.5 The GNS representation πω : A →B(Hω) of the algebraic state
ω on the unital C∗-algebra A is faithful if the Gelfand left ideal of ω,
Iω := {a ∈A | ω(a∗a) = 0} ,
is trivial, i.e., Iω = {0}.
Algebraic states with trivial Gelfand left ideal are called faithful. Notice that the
kernel Ker(πω) of the GNS representations πω of a C∗-algebra is a closed two-sided ∗-
ideal: it only depends on ω, not on the particular GNS triple, and generally it is smaller
than Iω. In fact, form (14.11) and the construction of the GNS representation, one
easily sees that the elements of Iω are the elements a ∈A such that πω(a)	ω = 0.
Conversely, a ∈Ker(πω) satisﬁes πω(a)πω(b)	ω = 0 for all b ∈A, which is a much
strongerrequirement.Therefore,inprinciple ω canhavefaithfulGNSrepresentations
even if Iω ̸= {0} but just because Ker(πω) is trivial.
A technical result that was proved in passing, during the previous proof, and that
is useful in itself, is the following.
Theorem 14.6 (Continuity of positive functionals) If ω is a positive functional on
the C∗-algebra A with unit I, then ω is continuous and ||ω|| = ω(I).
There is a useful technical corollary to the GNS theorem that deserves being stated
and proved.
Corollary 14.7 Let ω be an algebraic state on the unital C∗-algebra A with asso-
ciated GN S triple (Hω, πω, 	ω).
(a) If ψ : A →C is linear, positive and ψ ≤ω (ω −ψ is positive), there exists a
unique T ∈B(Hω) such that
ψ(b∗a) = (πω(b)	ω|T πω(a)	ω)ω ∀a, b ∈A .
Moreover 0 ≤T ≤I and T ∈πω(A)′ (T commutes with each πω(a), a ∈A).
(b) Conversely, if 0 ≤T ≤I and T ∈πω(A)′, then ψ(a) := (	ω|T πω(a)	ω)ω, for
every a ∈A, is a positive functional with ψ ≤ω.
Proof (a) Take ψ as in the assumptions. Since
|ψ(b∗a)|2 ≤ψ(b∗b)ψ(a∗a) ≤ω(b∗b)ω(a∗a) = ||[b]||ω ||[a]||ω ,
setting ψ′([b], [a]) := ψ(b∗a), Riesz’s theorem warrants the existence of T ∈
B(Hω) with ψ′([b], [a]) = ([b]|T [a])ω. In other terms ψ(b∗a) = (πω[b]	ω|
T πω(a)	ω). Furthermore, by construction:
([b] |(T πω(a) −πω(a)T)[c])ω = ψ(b∗ac) −ψ((a∗b)∗c) = ψ(b∗ac) −ψ(b∗ac) = 0 .
(b) is immediate.

Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
Remark 14.8 (1) The cyclic vector 	ω is a unit vector, by (a) (ii) in the GNS theorem,
since a = I and ω(I) = 1.
(2) Irrespective of the way one proves the GNS theorem, the ∗-representation of
unital C∗-algebras πω must be continuous, because of Theorem 8.22, and must also
satisfy ||πω(a)|| ≤||a|| for any a ∈A. In addition, the same theorem implies πω is
isometric (||πω(a)|| = ||a|| for any a ∈A) precisely when it is faithful (one-to-one).
(3) If we deal with C∗-algebras without unit, algebraic states can be deﬁned anyway.
They are positive, bounded linear functionals, but ω(I) = 1 is replaced by ||ω|| = 1.
These two conditions are equivalent on unital C∗-algebras, by Theorem 14.6. We
saw in Sect.7.6.5 that if we restrict to the C∗-algebra B∞(H) of compact operators
on a Hilbert space H (which has no unit, because in inﬁnite dimensions the identity
operator is never compact), algebraic states are exactly the positive operators of trace
class with unit trace.
■
If ω is an algebraic state on A, every statistical operator on the Hilbert space of
a GNS representation of ω, i.e. every positive, trace-class operator with unit trace
T ∈B1(Hω) (a statistical operator), determines an algebraic state
A ∋a 
→tr (T πω(a)) ,
evidently. This is true, in particular, for  ∈Hω with ||||ω = 1, in which case the
above deﬁnition reduces to
A ∋a 
→(|πω(a))ω .
To this end we have
Deﬁnition 14.9 If ω is an algebraic state on the unital C∗-algebra A, every algebraic
state on A obtained either from a statistical operator or a unit vector, in a GNS
representation of ω, is called normal state of ω. The set Fol(ω) of normal states is
the folium of the algebraic state ω.
Note that in order to determine Fol(ω) one can use a ﬁxed GNS representation
of ω. In fact, as the GNS representation of ω varies, normal states do not change, as
implied by part (b) of the GNS theorem.
The folium of a state ω of the algebra of observables A can be naïvely thought
of as the set of algebraic states arising from the action of observables of A on ω,
possibly through a limiting process.
By the GNS theorem, namely, every unit vector  ∈Hω is a limit of πω(bn)	ω
as n →+∞, provided we choose bn ∈A suitably. Hence, the GNS theorem implies
that the algebraic state associated to , which is an element of Fol(ω), can be always
computed as
ω(a) = (|πω(a))ω =
lim
n→+∞ω(b∗
nabn) .
The other algebraic states in the folium of ω are determined by positive, trace-class
operators T ∈B(Hω)withunittrace.Decomposing T spectrallyasaninﬁniteconvex

and fall back into the previous case.
In case A is a von Neumann algebra of operators on H, normal states are deﬁned
as follows (recall that there already is a natural representation of A, the one over A
itself).
Deﬁnition 14.10 Looking at a von Neumann algebra R ⊂B(H) on the Hilbert
space H as a C∗-algebra, a normal state of R is an algebraic state ω satisfying
ω(A) = tr(ρω A) for some positive ρω ∈B1(H) with unit trace determined by ω,
and for every A ∈R.
An important characterisation holds [BrRo02].
Proposition 14.11 Consider an algebraic state ω : R →C on the von Neumann
algebra R ⊂B(H) for a given Hilbert space H. The following facts are equivalent:
(a) ω is normal;
(b) ω is continuous in the σ-weak topology (cf. Deﬁnition 3.94);
(c) ω is completely additive:
ω

Pj
⎞
⎠=

j∈J
ω(Pj)
for every family {Pj} j∈J ⊂R of pairwise-orthogonal, orthogonal projectors (nota-
tion as in Theorem 7.72).
Remark 14.12 If R = B(C2), every state is normal, by direct inspection. Instead, if
we consider σ-additive measures on L (C2), Remark 7.28(4) proves that there exist
measures which are not normal states. This is the reason why Theorem 7.72 needs
the further hypothesis that the direct sum of R does not contain type-I2 algebras
(Sect.7.6.3). In this regard, the notion of state on a von Neumann algebra seems
to be more rigid than the notion of measure over the projector lattice of that von
Neumann algebra.
■
We will prove during Lemma 14.28 that any unital C∗-algebra always admits states
(hence a convex set of states). We can ask whether pure states exist, i.e. if the set of
states of a unital C∗-algebra contains extreme elements. The answer is yes, and one
shows that every algebraic state can be obtained as a limit of a sequence of a convex
combination of pure states, in the ∗-weak topology.
Theorem 14.13 The set S(A) of algebraic states of a C∗-algebra A with unit is a
bounded and convex compact subset of A′ in the ∗-weak topology. Moreover, S(A)
coincides with the ∗-weak closure of the convex hull of pure states (which is therefore
non-empty).

880
14
Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
Proof By Theorem 14.6 the convex set S(A) is contained in the closed unit ball inside
the dual of A. The latter is ∗-weakly compact, by Theorem 2.80 of Banach-Alaoglu.
As the set of states is closed in that topology (the proof is straightforward), it is also
compact in the dual of A and convex. The Krein-Milman theorem 2.81 guarantees
the set of extreme algebraic states is not empty, and the closure of its convex hull is
S(A).
□
14.1.4
Pure States and Irreducible Representations
We devote this section to an important relationship between pure algebraic states and
irreducible representations of the algebra of observables: ω is pure if and only if the
representation πω is irreducible. To prove it we need the following lemma.
Lemma 14.14 An algebraic state φ on a unital C∗-algebra A is pure if and only
if φ = ψ1 + ψ2 for positive functionals ψi : A →C, i = 1, 2, implies ψi = λiφ for
some λ1, λ2 ∈C.
Proof Ifφ isnotpure,itisnotextremeinthesetofalgebraicstates,soφ = 1
2φ1 + 1
2φ2
for φ1 ̸= φ ̸= φ2. Deﬁning ψi := 1
2φi, we see that φ = ψ1 + ψ2, where ψ1 ̸= λ1φ
irrespective of λ1. Let us assume φ is pure, conversely. First, if λ ∈(0, 1) and φ =
λφ1 + (1 −λ)φ2 for some states φi, then φ = φ1 = φ2. So assume such φ satisﬁes
φ = ψ1 + ψ2, for some positive functionals ψ1, ψ2. We claim ψi = λiφ for some
numbers λi.
If ψi(I) = 0 for i = 1 or i = 2, then ψi = 0 by Theorem 14.6, and the conclu-
sion follows trivially. So suppose ψi(I) ̸= 0,i = 1, 2. Deﬁne φi(a) := ψi(I)−1ψi(a).
Then φi is a state and φ = λφ1 + (1 −λ)φ2, with λ = ψ1(I) and 1 −λ = φ(I) −
ψ1(I) = ψ2(I). Since φ is extremal, φ1 = φ2 = φ, hence ψi = ψi(I)φ, i = 1, 2. □
Now the announced result can be stated.
Theorem 14.15 (Characterisation of pure algebraic states) Let ω be an algebraic
state on the unital C∗-algebra A and (Hω, πω, 	ω) a corresponding GNS triple. Then
ω is pure if and only if πω is irreducible.
Proof By Schur’s lemma (see esp. Remark 11.38), πω is irreducible iff πω(A)′ =
{cI}c∈C. A direct consequence of Corollary 14.7 is that πω(A)′ = {cI}c∈C iff
0 ≤ψ ≤ω implies ψ = cω for some c ∈C. But 0 ≤ψ ≤ω iff ω = ψ + (ω −ψ),
together with ψ ≥0 and ω −ψ ≥0. In summary, πω is irreducible iff ω = ψ1 + ψ2,
ψi ≥0 imply ψi = λiω for some choice of λi. The previous lemma tells πω is irre-
ducible iff ω is pure.
□
Now we have two important consequences that relate pure states to irreducible rep-
resentations of a C∗-algebra with unit.
Corollary 14.16 Let ω be a pure state on the unital C∗-algebra A and  ∈Hω a
unit vector. Then

14.1 Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
881
(a) the functional
A ∋a 
→(|πω(a))ω ,
deﬁnes a pure algebraic state and (Hω, πω, ) is a GNS triple for it. In that case, GNS
representations of algebraic states given by non-zero vectors in Hω are all unitarily
equivalent.
(b) Unit vectors , ′ ∈Hω give the same (pure) algebraic state if and only if
 = c′ for some c ∈C, |c| = 1, i.e. if and only if  and ′ belong to the same ray
of Hω.
Proof (a) Consider the closed space M := πω(A); we will show it coincides with
Hω. By construction π(a)M ⊂M for a ∈A, so M is closed and πω-invariant.
As the representation is irreducible, necessarily M = Hω or M = {0}. The latter
case is impossible because πω(I) =  ̸= 0. Now the claim is clear by construction,
because (Hω, πω, ) satisﬁes the GNS assumptions for a triple of an algebraic state
given by  as above, which is pure because the GNS representation is irreducible.
The last statement is obvious since all GNS representations can be constructed as
above. The unitary transformation between two such is always the identity operator.
(b) If  = c′ the two vectors give the same pure algebraic state. If, conversely,
two unit vectors determine the same pure algebraic state, i.e. (|πω(a))ω =
(′|πω(a)′)ω for every a ∈A, then we decompose  = c′ + 	 with 	 orthog-
onal to ′. In this way
(|πω(a))ω = |c|2(′|πω(a)′)ω + c(	|πω(a)′)ω + c(′|πω(a)	)ω ,
whence
(1 −|c|2)(′|πω(a)′)ω = c(	|πω(a)′)ω + c(′|πω(a)	)ω .
Choose a = I, so that the right-hand side vanishes and then the left-hand side does,
too. This is possible only if |c| = 1. Back to  = c′ + 	, we obtain 	 = 0 because
1 = ||′||2 = |c|2 + ||	||2.
□
Corollary 14.17 If A is a C∗-algebra with unit, every irreducible representation
π : A →H is the GNS representation of a state pure.
Proof Let 	 ∈H be a unit vector. As the representation is irreducible, π(A)	 is
dense in H. It is easy to see that (H, π, 	) is a GNS triple for ω(·) = (	|π(·)	).
The latter state is pure because of irreducibility.
□
Remark 14.18 Consider, in the standard (not algebraic) formulation, a physical sys-
tem S described on the Hilbert space HS, and a mixed state ρ ∈S(H). The map
ωρ : B(H) ∋A 
→tr(ρ A) deﬁnes an algebraic state on the C∗-algebra B(HS).
By the GNS theorem, there exist another Hilbert space Hρ, a representation πρ :
B(HS) →B(Hρ) and a unit vector 	ρ ∈Hρ such that
tr(ρ A) = (	ρ|πρ(A)	ρ)

882
14
Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
for A ∈B(HS). Therefore it seems that the initial mixed state has been transformed
into a pure state! How is this possible?
The answer follows from Theorem 14.15: 	ρ cannot correspond to any vec-
tor U −1	ρ in HS, under any unitary transformation U : HS →Hρ with U AU −1 =
πρ(A). In fact the representation B(HS) ∋A 
→A ∈B(HS) is irreducible, whereas
πρ cannot be irreducible because the state of ρ is not an extreme point in the space
of non-algebraic states, and so it cannot be extreme in the larger space of algebraic
states. (The precise form – up to unitary transformations – of the representation πρ
will be discussed in Example 14.19(4).)
This remark should clarify that the correspondence pure (algebraic) states vs. state
vectors, automatic in the standard formulation (in absence of superselection rules),
holds in Hilbert spaces of GNS representations of pure algebraic states, but not in
Hilbert spaces of GNS representations of mixed algebraic states.
■
Example 14.19 (1) Let us focus on the standard theory described on a complex
separable Hilbert space H in order to discuss the simplest possible example. Assume
that the algebra of observables is the whole B(H) and ﬁx a Hilbert-space pure state
represented, up to phase, by a unit vector ψ. The map
ωψ : B(H) ∋A 
→(ψ|Aψ)
deﬁnes a normal algebraic state. Let us construct a GNS representation of ωψ, and
remember that all other GNS representations will be unitarily equivalent to it, in view
of Theorem 14.4(b). If we set ı(A) := A for every A ∈B(H), then (H, ı, ψ) is easily
a GNS triple for ωψ. The only thing to check is that Aψ ranges in a dense subspace as
A varies in B(H). To this end, deﬁne M := {Aψ | A ∈B(H)}. Evidently, M is a non-
trivial closed subspace of H invariant under the action of B(H). As a consequence
of Proposition 3.93, M = H. We have proved that (H, ı, ψ) is a GNS triple for ωψ.
Notice that the representation ı is clearly irreducible. Using B(H) as algebra of
observables, this result implies that pure Hilbert-space states, as of Deﬁnition 7.36,
are pure states also in the algebraic sense, for Theorem 14.15. This is not an evident
result because a pure state of Deﬁnition 7.36 could be, in principle, a non-trivial
convex combination of algebraic states which are not normal.
(2) For commutative C∗-algebras with unit the following characterisation of pure
states holds.
Proposition 14.20 If A is a commutative C∗-algebra with unit, a state ω : A →C
is pure if and only if it is multiplicative: ω(ab) = ω(a)ω(b) for any a, b ∈A.
Proof That ω is pure implies πω is irreducible, but πω(a) commutes with every other
πω(b) since A is commutative. By Schur’s lemma πω(A) = {cI | c ∈C}. Using the
GNS representation gives ω(ab) = ω(a)ω(b). Conversely if ω is multiplicative, by
the GNS theorem we can write
(πω(a∗)	ω|πω(b)	ω)ω = (πω(a∗)	ω|	ω)ω(	ω|πω(b)	ω)ω ,

14.1 Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
883
so 	ω, alone, is a basis of Hω, because πω(A)	ω is dense in Hω. Therefore Hω has
dimension 1, and all its operators are numbers. In particular, πω(A)′ = {cI | c ∈C},
which means πω is irreducible by Schur’s lemma.
□
(3) The next example does not originate in QM. Take a compact Hausdorff space X
and the commutative C∗-algebra with unit C(X) of C-valued continuous maps on X,
equipped with the usual pointwise algebraic operations, involution given by complex
conjugation and norm || ||∞. If μ denotes a Borel probability measure on X, then
ωμ : C(X) ∋f 
→

X
f dμ
deﬁnes an algebraic state onC(X). The GNS theorem then gives a triple (Hμ, πμ, 	μ)
where: Hμ = L2(X, dμ), (πω( f )ψ)(x) := f (x)ψ(x) for every x ∈X, ψ ∈Hμ and
f ∈C(X). The cyclic vector 	ω coincides with the constant map 1 on X.
It can be checked that pure states are the Dirac measures δx concentrated at points
x ∈X. In this sense probability measures can be understood as “thick” points.
(4) Let us again return to the standard theory described on a complex separable
Hilbert space H, and suppose that the algebra of observables is the whole B(H). Fix
a mixed state represented by positive trace-class operator T with unit trace. The map
ωT : B(H) ∋A 
→tr(T A)
deﬁnes a normal algebraic state. Let us construct a GNS representation of ωT , remem-
bering that all other GNS representations are unitarily equivalent to this one by
Theorem 14.4(b). First of all decompose T spectrally,
T =

k∈N
pk(ψk| )ψk .
Above, N may be uncountable but the non-zero pk form a ﬁnite or countable set,
1 ≥pk ≥pk+1 ≥0, 
k∈N pk = 1 and {ψk}k∈N is a Hilbert basis of H. The series
of T converges in the uniform topology. With these hypotheses, consider the Hilbert
space HωT deﬁned by the Hilbert orthogonal sum
HωT := ⊕k∈N ′Hk
with Hk = H for every k ∈N ′
(14.13)
where N ′ ⊂N contains only the indices k such that pk > 0. Next deﬁne the vector
	ωT := ⊕k∈N ′√pkψk .
(14.14)
It is evident that 	ωT ∈HωT and it is easy to prove that the map
πωT : B(H) ∋A 
→⊕k∈N ′ Ak
with Ak = A for every k ∈N ′

pk(ψk|Aψk) = ωT (A) for every A ∈B(H).
To conclude that (HωT , πωT , 	ωT ) is a GNS triple of ωT it is sufﬁcient to establish
that 	ωT is cyclic for πωT . Let us show it. If  = ⊕k∈N ′φk ∈HωT , assume that

(14.16)
To prove our claim it is enough to obtain  = 0. Fix k ∈N ′ and consider the sub-
set of B(H) made of elements B := APk, where A ∈B(H) and Pk := (ψk| )ψk.
Specialising (14.16) to these elements, we have
(φk|Aψk) = 0 ,
∀A ∈B(H) .
The set of vectors Aψk is dense in H = Hk when A varies in B(H), as a trivial
consequence of Corollary 14.16(a), so that φk = 0. Since k is arbitrary, we may
conclude that  = 0 and thus 	ωT is cyclic for πωT as wanted.
We have constructed a GNS triple for ωT . It is evident from the construction that
(14.15) is reducible if N ′ contains more than one element, as every closed subspace
Hk ⊂HωT is invariant under πωT . All this agrees with Theorem 14.15, since a mixed
Hilbert-space state T , deﬁned in accordance with Deﬁnition 7.36, must be a non-pure
algebraic state a fortiori when viewed as an algebraic normal state ωT .
Moreover the representation we have found is evidently injective. This last result
is clearly invariant under the action of unitary operators, and hence is valid for every
GNS representation of ωT . In other words the following proposition holds.
Proposition 14.21 Let H be a separable Hilbert space. Normal states of B(H)
necessarily have faithful GNS representations. Therefore if the GNS representations
of a state ω of B(H) is not faithful, ω cannot be normal.
The kernel Kω of a non-faithful GNS representation πω of a state ω of B(H) is a
two-sided ∗-ideal of B(H), as one proves immediately. Since πω is continuous, Kω
is also closed in the uniform topology of B(H). If H is separable, there is only one
non-trivial two-sided ∗-ideal of B(H) that is closed in the uniform topology, namely
the ideal of compact operators B∞(H) (Theorem 4.17). So, in particular, ω(A) = 0
for every compact operator whenever ω admits non-faithful GNS representations
and hence is not normal. This suggests that non-normal states of B(H) may display
quite pathological features.

Further Comments on the Algebraic Approach and
the GNS Construction
In a general setup, especially when we deal with algebras arising from Quantum
Field Theories, it is sometimes reasonable to suppose that the C∗-algebra A whose
self-adjoint elements represent observables be simple.
Deﬁnition 14.22 A C∗-algebra A is simple if its only closed two-sided ideals that
are invariant under the involution are A and {0}.
The reason for ﬁnding simple algebras appealing is that every non-trivial repre-
sentation (whether GNS or not), on whichever Hilbert space, is faithful (injective)
hence isometric, as the next proposition proves.
Proposition 14.23 If A is a simple C∗-algebra with unit and π : A →B(H) a
representation on the Hilbert space H ̸= {0}, then π is faithful (one-to-one) and
isometric.
Proof The null space of π : A →B(H) is a two-sided ideal in A that is closed (π
is continuous by Theorem 8.22) and invariant under the involution, as is immediate
to see. But Ker(π) = A is impossible since π(I) = I ̸= 0. Hence our representation
must be injective because Ker(π) = {0}, and so isometric by Theorem 8.22.
□
This means that every operator representation of a simple, unital C∗-algebra faith-
fully represents the algebra, quite literally. However, as we saw at the end of Example
14.19(4), there are cases of interest in physics where the relevant algebra of observ-
ables is not simple.
Sometimes the C∗-structure is too rigid, whereas a ∗-algebra with unit is better
tailored to described observables. This is the case when one studies bosonic quantum
ﬁelds without using Weyl C∗-algebras. The key part of the GNS theorem is still valid.
In fact, we have the following version of the GNS theorem, whose proof is similar
to (actually much simpler than) the previous one.
Theorem 14.24 (GNS theorem for ∗-algebras with unit) Let A be a ∗-algebra with
unit I and ω : A →C a positive linear functional with ω(I) = 1. Then
(a)thereexistsaquadruple(Hω, Dω, πω, 	ω)madeofaHilbertspaceHω,asubspace
Dω ⊂Hω, a linear map πω : A →L(Dω, Hω) and an element 	ω ∈Dω, such that:
(i) Dω is πω(a)-invariant for every a ∈A, since Dω = πω(A)	ω;
(ii) 	ω is cyclic for πω, that is, Dω is dense in Hω;
(iii) πω : A →πω(A) is an algebra homomorphism satisfying: πω(I) = I and
πω(a∗) = πω(a)∗↾Dω, a ∈A;
(iv) (	ω|π(a)	ω) = ω(a), a ∈A.
(b) If (H, D, π, 	) fulﬁls (i)–(iv), there exists a unitary operator U : Hω →H such
that 	 = U	ω, D = UDω and π(a) = Uπω(a)U −1 for any a ∈A.
Now the function πω is not continuous (there is no preferred topology on A). The
operators πω(a) do not belong in B(Hω), in general. Every operator πω(a) is closable

Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
in Dω by Theorem 5.10(b), since the domain contains the dense subspace Dω, making
πω(a)∗densely deﬁned, and moreover πω(a∗) ⊂πω(a)∗.
Still referring to Theorem 14.24, it is worth remarking that elements properly
corresponding to observables – i.e. self-adjoint elements a ∈A – are mapped to
symmetric operators πω(a) by the last requirement in (iii). In general, however, even
if a = a∗the associated operators will not be self-adjoint: πω(a)∗= πω(a). The
weaker version πω(a)∗∗= πω(a)∗(essential self-adjointness) should be valid for
self-adjoint elements a under some condition on either the algebra and/or the state.
Alas, precise technical conditions and their physical signiﬁcance are poorly explored
in the literature, and deserve further investigation.
A general quantum theory, formulated algebraically, seeks to ﬁnd, among the
immense collection of algebraic states on a C∗-algebra of observables in a given
physical system, those states that bear some meaning. We refer to the aforemen-
tioned suggestions for a deep study of such a wide-ranging topic. We shall return to
this point later, although usually it is the physics that suggests the choice of some
privileged state ω. For instance, the reference state of Quantum Field Theories with-
out gravity (Minkowski’s ﬂat spacetime) and without interactions is the so-called
vacuum. The vacuum state corresponds to the absence of particles associated to the
ﬁeld in question, and is invariant under the Poincaré group. The picture changes
abruptly when “gravity is turned on”, i.e. when one introduces curvature on the
spacetime: the absence of the Poincaré symmetry, in general, does not allow to select
one’s favourite (algebraic) state uniquely, but rather an entire class of states. Most
of the times these are known as Hadamard states [Wal94, KhMo15]. These enable
to make sense of renormalisation, and also deﬁne important observables such as the
energy-momentum tensor (cf. [Mor03], for example).
14.1.6
Hilbert-Space Formulation Versus Algebraic
Formulation
Withholding the point of view adopted up to Chap.13 included, in which one starts
from a given Hilbert space HS, the C∗-algebra AS of observables associated to a
system S can, in the limit situation, be the whole space of bounded operators B(HS).
A choice that makes more physical sense is to deﬁne the algebra of observables as
a unital C∗-subalgebra in B(HS): this typically has the structure of a von Neumann
algebra (see Sect.3.3.2) of type I when the possible superselection rules are Abelian
(Proposition 11.18(a)), and is generated by the PVMs of the system’s observables
in accordance with Deﬁnition 3.92. However, type I arises also in the presence of a
non-Abelian superselection rules for elementary particles, as brieﬂy discussed at the
end of Sect.11.2.3.
Since AS is a von Neumann algebra and hence is strongly closed, we can inte-
grate spectral measures, at least in bounded measurable functions, and still obtain
elements of the algebra. This von Neumann algebra is actually completely deter-

mined by the associated lattice of its orthogonal projections, by Proposition 7.61(b).
Taking bounded operators is no major restriction from the point of view of physics.
Any observable A represented by an unbounded self-adjoint operator, namely, is
physically the same as the sequence of observables represented by bounded self-
adjoint operators An :=

(−n,n] λd P(A)(λ), n = 1, 2, . . . as discussed in Sect.11.1.2.
For the time being we will assume AS = RS = B(HS), and later return to the general
case where superselection rules are turned on.
Clearly every state ρ ∈S(HS) determines a (normal) algebraic state on the
C∗-algebra B(HS) by setting ωρ(A) := tr(ρ A), A ∈B(HS). From what we said,
a state in S(HS) is pure precisely when it is algebraically pure in the C∗-algebra
B(HS). The set of algebraic states on B(HS) coming from positive trace-class oper-
ators with unit trace does not exhaust all algebraic states on B(HS), but only a small
part of them.
Nevertheless, viewing the C∗-algebra of observables as a speciﬁc C∗-algebra of
operators on a Hilbert space (possibly the entire algebra of bounded operators) in
the general framework of the algebraic formulation would be like sliding back in the
theory, for it would lead to assume the theoretical existence of a privileged Hilbert
space where states are described. This would rule out, for systems with inﬁnitely
many degrees of freedom, a host of states corresponding to non-unitarily equivalent
representations, which do exist and have a meaning.
In the general case observables are therefore taken to form an abstract C∗-algebra
A; the Hilbert space representation is ﬁxed only after a state ω has been given, and is
the Hilbert space Hω of the GNS construction. At this point, in the Hilbert space the
C∗-algebra may be enlarged to a von Neumann algebra (still C∗), simply by taking the
doublecommutant πω(A)′′ generatedbyπω(A).Itis herethattype-I I I vonNeumann
algebras naturally arise, and may be used to represent physical systems in the peculiar
physical states discussed in the second and third case at the end of Sect.11.2.3.
Notice however that as πω(A)′′ is closed in the weak, strong and uniform topologies,
there are elements in πω(A)′′ that are not limits in π(A) in the uniform topology
(coinciding with the topology of A under πω). These elements do not correspond
to elements of A, and cannot be considered, in this sense, “true observables of the
system”, independent of the choice of state. In particular, elementary propositions
like: “the reading of a falls in the Borel set E” are not usually thinkable as elements
of A, i.e. observables. These should correspond to maps χE(a), where the function
of the self-adjoint element a is deﬁned via continuous functional calculus under the
representation a : C(σ(a)) →A of Theorem 8.36. But χE /∈C(σ(a)) in general.
Strictly speaking, we can make sense of these observables only after having ﬁxed a
state, working in its GNS representation.
It would, actually, be possible to narrow down this gap between the two formula-
tions in the following, a bit artiﬁcial, manner [Stre07]. From Chap.8 we know that
the integral of a bounded, measurable map in a PVM on the Hilbert space H is deﬁned
using the uniform topology, which is the natural topology of the C∗-algebra B(H).
Hence one could always ask the C∗-algebra A of observables of a physical system be
generated by the p ∈A that have the same features of orthogonal projectors in Hilbert
spaces: p = pp and p∗= p. These elements correspond to orthogonal projectors in

888
14
Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
the Hilbert space of any GNS representation of A. Therefore one could choose the
elements p, using GNS representations of physically meaningful states, so to obtain
the PVMs of the relevant observables, whence also the (bounded measurable) maps
of those observables.
However, regardless any a priori constraint on the algebra of observables or a
posteriori additions – a general comprehensive technical discussion on all these pos-
sibilities appears in [Emc72, Sect. 2.1.g] – something about elementary propositions
can be said in the general case, as we go to illustrate (essentially following a remark
in [Wal94]). Let Bs(R) be the algebra of subsets of R including ∅and all ﬁnite dis-
joint unions of intervals (a, b] and (c, +∞) with −∞≤a ≤b < +∞and c ∈R.
One can easily prove that for every E ∈Bs(R) there is a sequence of real continu-
ous functions fn and a constant K < +∞such that | fn(x)| ≤K for all x ∈R and
n ∈N and fn(x) →χE(x) for every x ∈R. The elements fn(a) are well-deﬁned in
A, but the sequence { fn(a)}n∈N generally does not converge in A. However, its GNS
representation {πω( fn(a))}n∈N, referred to any ﬁxed state ω, strongly converges to
the correct element of the PVM of πω(a):
P(πω(a))
E
= s- lim
n→+∞πω( fn(a)) ,
as one easily verify (taking (i) in Theorems 8.39(b) and 8.54(c, d) into account, for
T ∗= T = πω(a)). Even the probability that, in the state ω, the reading of a falls in
the Borel set E ∈Bs(R), can be computed using only that sequence of observables:
(	ω|P(πω(a))
E
	ω) =
lim
n→+∞ω( fn(a)) .
In this sense, the sequence of abstract observables { fn(a)}n∈N ⊂A embodies the
entire information of the elementary proposition “the reading of a falls in the Borel
set E ∈Bs(R)”, though that proposition cannot be represented in terms of an ele-
ment of A. Notice that two bounded sequences of continuous functions fn and gn,
pointwise converging to the same characteristic function χE, for E ∈Bs(R), give
rise to the same P(πω(a))
E
for every ﬁxed state ω. Therefore, more properly, elemen-
tary propositions are univocally represented by equivalence classes of sequences of
observables of A.
Actually, the restriction E ∈Bs(R) is not as strong as it could seem at ﬁrst
glance, since {P(πω(a))
E
}E∈Bs(R) can uniquely be extended to a PVM that, in turn,
coincides with the whole PVM {P(πω(a))
F
}F∈B(R). This follows straightforwardly from
Theorem 1.41, since the σ-algebra generated by Bs(R) is nothing but the Borel σ-
algebra B(R) itself.
At this juncture the abstract formulation appears to part rather evidently from the
elementary formulation, which is based on a pre-existing Hilbert space and on the
fundamental nature of elementary propositions about observable readings.
The process of reduction of the state, that follows the outcome of a measurement,
should be treated likewise. Take an observable a ∈A, suppose the system is in the

14.1 Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
889
pre-measurement state ω, and let the (ideal) reading of a fall in the Borel set E. After
the measurement the state is
ωE : A ∋b 
→(	ω|PEπω(b)PE	ω)
(PE	ω|PE	ω)
,
where, to simplify the notation, PE is the PVM element of the self-adjoint operator
πω(a) corresponding to the Borel set E.
An interesting theoretical question concerns the possibility to introduce the notion
of coherent superposition of (algebraic) pure states without explicitly referring to
their vector-space representation via the GNS construction, but dealing with the alge-
braic framework only. The answer is that this is indeed possible, though technically
involved [Zan91].
14.1.7
Algebraic Abelian Superselection Rules
The algebraic formulation permits to handle situations – necessary on physical
grounds, as we said – in which non-unitarily equivalent representations of the same
algebra AS of observables of a given system S coexist. Such representations are asso-
ciated to pairs of distinct algebraic states giving inequivalent GNS representations.
If ≃denotes the unitary equivalence of GNS representations, we may decompose
the set of pure states, i.e. of irreducible representations, in equivalence classes under
the relation:
ω1 ∼ω2
if and only if πω1 ≃πω2 .
(14.17)
These classes have a meaning in relationship to superselection rules (see Sects.7.7.1,
7.7.2, 11.2.1, 11.2.2), as Haag and other mathematical physicists noticed.
To get into the matter we need to take a step back. Let us return to the standard
formulation in the Hilbert space, though with algebraic focus on observables rather
than the logic of admissible propositions. Consider a quantum theory that admits
superselection rules. At least in some cases (Sect.7.7.1) these require an observable
Q (like the electric charge) to be always deﬁned, with arbitrary value q, on pure
normal states. We will assume for a moment that the possible values are countable
(we assume σ(Q) = σp(Q)), so to have closed, pairwise orthogonal coherent sectors
HSq in the separable Hilbert space HS. The HSq are the q-eigenspaces of Q. The
algebra of (bounded) observables is the von Neumann algebra AS := RS generated
by the orthogonal projectors in L (HS) (hence all bounded operators) that commute
with the projectors Pq onto the HSq. In other words RS := ({Pq | q ∈σp(Q)}′)′′ =
{Pq | q ∈σp(Q)}′. Clearly RS has a non-trivial centre that contains Pq. Therefore
eachcoherentsectorisinvariantundereveryphysicallyadmissibleobservable,andon
every sector there will be a representation of RSq obtained by restricting observables
to the closed invariant space. This algebra evidently has the form

890
14
Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
RSq = {A↾HSq | A ∈RS}
(14.18)
and is a von Neumann algebra on HSq as the reader can easily prove. We simultane-
ously have a Hilbert decomposition into pairwise orthogonal closed subspaces and
a corresponding direct decomposition of von Neumann algebras
HS =

q∈σp(Q)
HSq ,
RS =

q∈σp(Q)
RSq .
Every value q that Q can take gives a coherent sector HSq equipped with its own
algebra RSq, which by (14.18) is a representation
πq : RS ∋A 
→A↾HSq∈RSq
of RS itself. Distinct choices of q produce unitarily inequivalent and non-faithful
representations. In fact, if q1 ̸= q2 on HSq1 and HSq2, Q is represented by different
multiples of the identity q1I and q2I. Hence Uq1IU −1 = q1I ̸= q2I whichever
unitary map U : HSq1 →HSq2 we take. Non-faithfulness arises form the fact that if
Q assumes the value q on HSq, then Q −qI ̸= 0 but πq(Q −qI) = 0.
If more than one superselection rule is activated, Wightman [Wigh95] conjec-
tured that the rules are associated to a ﬁnite set of pairwise compatible observables
Q1, . . . , Qn in the centre of RS (we again assume σ(Q j) = σp(Q j) and that the
chargesareboundedoperators.Thelatterrequirementcaneasilyberelaxedbyassum-
ing that the charges are simply afﬁliated to RS). Supposing Wightman is right (see
however Remark 11.22 and Sect.11.2.3), the Hilbert space splits in an orthogonal
sum of coherent sectors HSk, k ∈K, common to all superselection rules. Every k
is completely ﬁxed by the values that all charges Q j assume on HSk, and for every
set of these values there is a k ∈K deﬁning a superselection sector HSk (K is a
countable set, or even ﬁnite if the spectrum of each Q j is ﬁnite). On each sector
we have a representation πk of the algebra RS of observables of the system. These
representations are mutually inequivalent, as we have seen.
If we assume, more restrictively, that the family {Q1, . . . , Qn} completely
describes all superselection rules of the system – in this case we say that the supers-
election rules are Abelian (see Sect.11.2.2), then we are committed to suppose that
every other central observable must be a function of them. In other words
{Q1, . . . , Qn}′′ = RS ∩R′
S .
It is possible to prove that this hypothesis is equivalent to requiring that the orthogonal
projectors P(Q1)
q1
· · · P(Qn)
qn
generating the joint spectral measure of the Q j are atoms
of the centre of the lattice LRS(HS) of projectors of RS (Proposition 11.21). As
we said before, the family of central projectors {Pk}k∈K is nothing but the family of
spectral projectors

and k ∈K (a subset of N) simply labels the values (q1, . . . , qn) ∈σ(Q1) × · · · ×
σ(Qn). In this way we recover the description of superselection rules of Sects.7.7.1,
7.7.2 and 11.2.1. We therefore have decompositions
HS =

k∈K
HSk ,
RS =

k∈K
RSk ,
(14.19)
where the algebras RSk are now factors, as we know from Sect.7.7.1.
If we further assume that RS contains a complete set of commuting observables,
we eventually have that RSk = B(HSk) and RS is of type I, by Proposition 11.18.
Each representation πk : RS ∋A 
→A↾HSk∈RSk of RS on each superselection sec-
tor is also irreducible. The representations πk are therefore non-faithful, unitarily
inequivalent irreducible representations of RS labelled by the values of the supers-
election charges Q j.
States over RS, in the sense of the non-algebraic formulation, can be described in
terms of σ-additive probability measures over LRS(HS) as discussed in Sects.7.7.1,
7.7.2. In turn, these measures can be identiﬁed with positive trace-class operators of
trace one using the generalisation of Gleason’s theorem, as discussed in Sect.7.7.2.
(All that happens in accordance with Propositions 14.11, 7.70, 7.72 and Remark 7.73,
when we assume HS separable with dim HSk ̸= 2 for every k ∈K). These are normal
states of RS from the algebraic viewpoint, and form a convex set S(HS)adm whose
subset Sp(HS)adm of extreme elements still contains normal states, represented by
the unit vectors of the sectors HSk.
Let us pass to the algebraic formulation, based on a C∗-algebra of observables
and the general notion of algebraic state – thus freeing ourselves from Hilbert spaces
and von Neumann algebras as the characterising structures of a physical system. The
picture now is suddenly more straightforward, for the use of C∗-algebras eschews
convoluted arguments and technical complications. Extending Wightman’s assump-
tion, in the algebraic formalism, superselection rules are accounted for by observ-
ables Q in the centre of the C∗-algebra AS of observables, i.e. the subalgebra of
elements commuting with all of AS. Every pure algebraic state ω, corresponding to
an irreducible representation of the algebra of observables, must inevitably select a
value of Q in the GNS representation by Schur’s lemma, as πω(Q) commutes with
all elements. That is to say, πω(Q) = qI for some q ∈R (now the values may be
uncountable, since the separable Hilbert space is not unique). Exactly as before, two
purealgebraicstatesω, ω′ withdistinctq ̸= q′ produceinequivalentGNSrepresenta-
tions, so there is no unitary operator U : Hω →Hω′ such that Uπω(a)U −1 = πω′(a)
for each a ∈AS (this identity is false for a = Q).
In general we expect that families of non-equivalent pure states (i.e. of inequiv-
alent irreducible representations) can be labelled by distinct values of a charge of
sorts, corresponding to some central observable. Eventually, at least for physically
important theories, the existence of superselection charges could be the reason for the

892
14
Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
existence of inequivalent irreducible representations of the C∗-algebra of observables
AS [Rob04], though no proof of this conjecture exists.
Remark 14.25 (1) The aforementioned interesting conjecture posits that irreducible
inequivalent representations of a given C∗-algebra of observables are due to supers-
election rules; these, in turn, arise from superselection charges. This is untenable for
elementary, and hence maybe un-physical, cases. In fact, the representations πω of
AS associated to different values of Q, if any, are non-faithful since πω(Q −qI) = 0
if q is the value of Q in the GNS representation of the state ω. If the algebra AS is
simple, all representations are faithful (Proposition 14.23) hence no superselection
charge Q may exist, even if unitarily inequivalent irreducible representations do
exist. This is the case for the Weyl C∗-algebra we will discuss shortly (see Lemma
14.37). However one expects that adding further elements to the algebra of observ-
ables which are natural in the von Neumann algebras of the GNS representations (as
the so-called number of particles for the Weyl C∗-algebra) will allow to restore a
description of the superselection rules in terms of superselection charges.
(2) In principle, further superselection rules can anyway show up in a speciﬁc GNS
representation of AS associated to a state ω, in case we think of the algebra, in such
representation, as the von Neumann algebra πω(AS)′′. This is larger than πω(AS),
so in general it has a non-trivial centre even if AS does not. (See [Pri00] for this
point, in particular concerning the interpretation of central observables of πω(AS)′′
as classical observables.)
■
Even in the absence of superselection charges with clear physical meaning, it is
natural to think of the GNS representations of the algebra AS associated with unitarily
inequivalent pure states ω as algebraic superselection sectors. For this, let us look at
the equivalence relation (14.17), denote by  the space of equivalence classes, and
pick a representative ω in every equivalence class [ω]. Then the Hilbert sum of the
unitarily inequivalent irreducible GNS representation spaces Hω,
H =

[ω]∈
Hω ,
can be viewed as the Hilbert space of the system in the presence of superselection
rules, each Hω playing the role of a superselection sector. Indeed, the unit-vector
states in all sectors exhaust the set of all possible algebraic pure states on A by
construction. Moreover, coherent superpositions
α	 + β	′
of unit vectors 	 ∈Hω, 	′ ∈Hω′ in different sectors (with |α|2 + |β|2 = 1) and
incoherent superpositions
|α|2	(	| ·) + |β|2	′(	′| ·)

14.1 Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories

deﬁne the same algebraic state. This is because they are indistinguishable when
acting on elements a ∈AS (represented on H through the GNS representation of
the case):

α	 + β	′ πω(a) ⊕πω′(a)(α	 + β	′)

= |α|2(	|πω(a)	) + |β|2(	′|πω′(a)	′) .
The algebraic mixed states on AS can be obtained as weak limits of incoherent
superpositions of unit vectors belonging to the spaces Hω, due to Theorem 14.13.
There are, however, crucial differences in comparison with the genuine Hilbert-
space description of superselection rules previously summarised.
(1) In general, H is not separable and  is uncountable.
(2) Not all (algebraic) mixed states are represented by trace-class operators on
H, though they are elements of the ∗-weak closure of the convex body generated
by the vector states of the sectors H.
(3) AS is a C∗-algebra, rather than a von Neumann algebra.
(4) In general, there are no elements in AS corresponding to orthogonal projectors
onto coherent sectors Hω. This contrasts with the standard Hilbert-space formulation,
where such elements are the central atomic projectors Pk ∈RS.
(5) A consequence of (4) is that an identity such as
AS =

[ω]∈
πω(AS) (false)
is generally false, whereas the analogue
RS =

k∈K
πk(RS) =

k∈K
RSk ,
holds for the standard Hilbert-space formulation of superselection rules.
(6) As a second consequence of (4), the representations πω of AS may be faithful,
again differently form the analogous representations πk of RS in the standard Hilbert-
space formulation, which are never faithful.
Remark 14.26 (1) If the set  has the cardinality of R at most, it would be also
possible to enlarge A by adding an observable Q to its centre, which is represented
by qI in each sector, with different q for different inequivalent sectors. Such a Q
would however merely be an artiﬁcial construction of dubious physical meaning.
(2) We stress that there is no real need for reformulating all the algebraic machinery
backwards in the Hilbert space H. Its introduction was only meant to point out
the analogies between the algebraic formulation and the Hilbert-space formulation
in relationship to the notion of coherent sectors. On the other hand, the crucial
differences listed above would deﬁnitely make a full Hilbert-space reformulation, in
particular without artiﬁcially extending AS, impossible.

Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
Thealgebraicinterpretationofsuperselectionsectorsthatwehavediscussedisappro-
priate for elementary systems, i.e., elementary particles in absence of non-Abelian
internal gauge symmetry. Here, pure states, vacuum states and ground states in par-
ticular play a crucial role. The picture is the natural algebraic extension of the case of
Abelian superselection rules, introduced in Sects.11.2.1 and 11.2.2 within the Hilbert
space formulation. For other physically important systems different from elementary
particles, like ﬁnite-temperature systems in the so-called thermodynamical limit, a
more appropriate algebraic description of superselection sectors exists. It is pro-
vided by unitary equivalence classes of GNS representations of states ω (satisfying
the so-called KMS condition) where the irreducibility condition πω(A)′ = {cI}c∈C
is relaxed to the factorial condition πω(A)′ ∩πω(A)′′ = {cI}c∈C. This is the alge-
braic analogue of non-Abelian superselection rules in the Hilbert-space formulation,
where the von Neumann algebra of observables in each sector is a factor (usually of
type I I I) with non-trivial commutant. The aforementioned algebraic states states ω
still describe some particular physical situation, as opposed to generic mixtures. For
instance, in case of thermodynamical equilibrium, some such factorial states – with
πω(A)′ ̸= {cI}c∈C – describe pure phases of a quantum system in the thermodynam-
ical limit.
14.1.8
Fell’s Theorem
We suggest to consult [Haa96, Rob04, Ear08] to ﬁnd lucid reviews on the algebraic
formalism and superselection sectors, especially for local theories based on nets
of observable algebras arising from Quantum Field Theory. Let us just make here
one general comment. We saw how the space of pure states decomposes in disjoint
families of states giving inequivalent representations, and the states of a same family
can be viewed as state vectors on one Hilbert space. So we would like to know if
it is possible, experimentally speaking, to say to which family a given pure state ω
belongs to. The answer is not simple, as shown by a theorem proved by Fell. For
pure states on a C∗-algebra with unit, Fell’s theorem says that pure states in a given
family are dense in the set of all pure states for the ∗-weak topology. Let us explain
why this abstract fact is relevant. In the real world we can conduct only a ﬁnite
(arbitrarily large) number of experiments. Suppose we can measure N observables
a1, a2, . . . , aN. The accuracy is ﬁnite, so the true value αi of the reading ω(ai) of ai
is only given up to εi > 0:
|ω(ai) −αi| < εi ,
i = 1, 2, . . . , N .
Now observe that the numbers αi and εi determine a neighbourhood in the space of
states with respect to the ∗-weak topology. Fell’s result implies that it is not possible
to establish to which family a given pure state ω belongs by using an arbitrarily large,
but ﬁnite, number of measurements with however small, yet ﬁnite, errors.

One way to simplify the problem [Haa96] is to choose a priori a family of pure
states with some ad hoc criterion. Supposing, for instance, that the algebra is spatially
localisable, we may assume that outside a certain region the physical system is absent.
Then all states of interest are those that outside a given and arbitrarily large region
resembling the vacuum state, when we measure on it observables localised outside
the region.

Proof of the Gelfand-Najmark Theorem, Universal
Representations and Quasi-equivalent
Representations
The GNSconstruction has a purely mathematical consequence known as theGelfand-
Najmark theorem (stated in Chap.8). It says that every abstract C∗-algebra with unit
can be realised as a C∗-algebra of operators on a Hilbert space, albeit not uniquely.
To prove the result we need a few technical lemmas.
Lemma 14.27 Let A be a C∗-algebra with unit I. Any bounded linear functional
φ : A →C with φ(I) = ||φ|| is positive.
Proof We will make use of Theorem 8.25, and, a usual, r(c) will denote the spectral
radius of c. Without loss of generality we assume φ(I) = 1. Let a ∈A be posi-
tive and set φ(a) = α + iβ, with α, β ∈R. We have to show α ≥0 and β = 0.
For small s ≥0 we have σ(I −sa) = {1 −st | t ∈σ(a)} ⊂[0, 1], since σ(a) ⊂
[0, +∞). Hence ||I −sa|| = r(I −sa) ≤1. Therefore 1 −sα ≤|1 −s(α + iβ)| =
|φ(I −sa)| ≤1, so α ≥0. Now deﬁne βn := a −αI + inβI, n = 1, 2, . . .. Then
||bn||2 = ||b∗
nbn|| = ||(a −αI)2 + n2β2I|| ≤||a −αI||2 + n2β2 .
Consequently
(n2 + 2n + 1)β2 = |φ(bn)|2 ≤||a −αI||2 + n2β2
n = 1, 2, . . .
and then β = 0.
□
Lemma 14.28 Let A be a C∗-algebra with unit and a ∈A.
(a) If α ∈σ(a) there exists a state φ : A →C such that φ(a) = α.
(b) If a ̸= 0, there exists a state φ : A →C with φ(a) ̸= 0.
(c) If a = a∗, there exists a state φ : A →C such that |φ(a)| = ||a||.
Proof (a) For any complex numbers β, γ we have αβ + γ ∈σ(βa + γ I), so |αβ +
γ | ≤||βa + γ I||. Hence asking φ(βa + γ I) := αβ + γ deﬁnes (unambiguously) a
linear functional on the subspace {βa + γ I | β, γ ∈C} such that φ(a) = α, φ(I) = 1
and ||φ|| = 1. By a corollary to the Hahn-Banach theorem, we can extend φ to a

896

Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
continuous linear functional on A satisfying ||φ|| = φ(I) = 1. The previous lemma
guarantees that the functional is a state on A with φ(a) = α.
(b) If a = a∗and a ̸= 0, then σ(a) ̸= {0}, for otherwise the properties of the spectral
radius of self-adjoint elements would imply ||a|| = r(a) = 0. Then the state φ of part
(a) satisﬁes φ(a) ̸= 0 for α ∈σ(a) \ {0}. Consider when a ̸= a∗,a ̸= 0. Then we can
decompose a = b + ic with b = b∗, c = c∗. If φ(a) = 0 for any state φ : A →C,
we would have 0 = φ(a) = φ(b) + iφ(c) for any φ. But the GNS theorem implies
φ(d) = φ(d) for d = d∗. Hence φ(b) = φ(c) = 0 for any φ. Since c and d are self-
adjoint, the proof’s initial argument forces b = c = 0 so a = 0. As this was excluded,
there must exist a state with φ(a) ̸= 0.
(c) Since ||a|| = sup{|λ| | λ ∈σ(a)} and σ(a) is compact in R, there must be an
element  ∈σ(a) with || = ||a||. Using part (a) with α =  proves the claim. □
Now we are ready to state and prove the Gelfand-Najmark theorem.
Theorem 14.29 (Gelfand-Najmark) For any unital C∗-algebra A there exist a
Hilbert space H and an (isometric) ∗-isomorphism φ : A →B, where B ⊂B(H)
is a C∗-subalgebra of B(H).
Proof For every x ∈A \ {0} let us ﬁx a state φx : A →C with φx(x) ̸= 0. This
state exists by part (b) of the above lemma. Consider the collection of GNS triples
(Hx, πx, 	x) associated to each φx, and the Hilbert sum
H :=

x∈A\{0}
Hx .
In this way the elements of H are of the form ψ = ⊕x∈A\{0}ψx := {ψx}x∈A\{0} with:

x∈A\{0}
||ψx||2
x < +∞.
(14.20)
On H we have an inner product making it a Hilbert space:
(ψ|ψ′) =

x∈A\{0}
(ψx|ψ′
x)x .
Deﬁne the map π : A →B(H) by imposing:
π(0) := 0 and (π(a)ψ)x := πx(a)ψx
for ψ ∈H, a ∈A \ {0} .
It is not hard to see π is a ∗-homomorphism of unital C∗-algebras mapping A to
B(H). By Theorem 8.22(c) π(A) is a unital C∗-algebra subalgebra of B(H). In
particular, ||π(a)|| ≤||a||, as prescribed by Theorem 8.22. In fact if (14.20) holds,
since Theorem 8.22 gives ||πx(a)|| ≤||a||, we obtain

14.1 Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
897
||π(a)ψ||2 =

x∈A\{0}
||πx(a)ψx||2
x ≤||a||2

x∈A\{0}
||ψx||2
x = ||a||2||ψ||2 < +∞.
To end the proof it sufﬁces to show π is isometric. By Theorem 8.22(a) that is equiv-
alent to injectivity. Suppose π(a) = 0, so πx(a)ψx = 0 for any x ∈A \ {0}, ψx ∈
Hx. In particular φx(a) = (	x|πx(a)	x) = 0, so choosing x = a gives φa(a) = 0.
But this is not possible if a ̸= 0. Therefore a = 0 and π is one-to-one, hence
isometric.
□
OneelementarycorollaryoftheGelfand-Najmarktheorem,inparticular,hasphysical
interest: it proves that the norm of a unital C∗-algebra is determined by the whole
collection of states.
Corollary 14.30 Let A be a C∗-algebra with unit I and denote by S(A) the collection
of algebraic states on A. Then:
||a|| =
sup
ω∈S(A)
|ω(a)|
if a∗= a ∈A.
(14.21)
Consequently:
||a||2 =
sup
ω∈S(A)
|ω(a∗a)|
if a ∈A.
(14.22)
Finally, if a, b ∈A:
a = b if and only if ω(a) = ω(b) for every ω ∈S(A).
Proof Let us start from the ﬁrst couple of statements. The second is an immedi-
ate consequence of the ﬁrst since ||a||2 = ||a∗a|| and (a∗a)∗= a∗a, so we have to
prove the former only. To this end, in view of the fact that states are positive hence
continuous, and that ||ω|| = ω(I) = 1 due to Theorem 14.6, we have:
sup
ω∈S(A)
|ω(a)| ≤
sup
ω∈S(A)
||ω|| ||a|| ≤
sup
ω∈S(A)
1 ||a|| .
We conclude that:
sup
ω∈S(A)
|ω(a)| ≤||a|| .
To obtain the opposite inequality, we pass to the C∗-algebra B ⊂B(H) representing
A isometrically under the action of the ∗-isomorphism φ (Gelfand-Najmark theorem).
Since φ(a) ∈B(H) is self-adjoint, Proposition 3.60(a) yields:
||a|| = ||φ(a)|| = sup{|(ψ|φ(a)ψ)| | ψ ∈H , ||ψ|| = 1} = sup
||ψ||=1
|ωψ(a)|
≤
sup
ω∈S(A)
|ω(a)| ,

898
14
Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
where we have exploited the fact that, for ||ψ|| = 1, the linear map
A ∋b 
→ωψ(b) := (ψ|φ(b)ψ)
is an algebraic state. The proof of the ﬁrst (and second) statement in the thesis ends
here, since we have established that:
sup
ω∈S(A)
|ω(a)| ≤||a|| ≤
sup
ω∈S(A)
|ω(a)| .
Concerning the last item in the thesis the only implication to prove is that a = b if
ω(a) = ω(b) for every ω ∈S(A). Let us prove it. If ω(a) = ω(b) then ω(a) = ω(b),
sothatω(a∗) = ω(b∗)bytheGNSconstruction.Therefore:ω(a + a∗−(b + b∗)) =
0 and ω(i(a −a∗) −i(b −b∗)) = 0. Since the arguments of ω are self-adjoint in
both cases and ω is arbitrary, the ﬁrst statement of the corollary implies a −b +
(a∗−b∗) = 0 and a −b −(a∗−b∗) = 0, which entail a −b = 0.
□
The Gelfand-Najmark theorem enables us to introduce an extremely useful technical
tool, the universal representation of a unital C∗-algebra.
Let A be a C∗-algebra with unit and denote by S(A) ⊂A′ the convex set of
its algebraic states. Take the GNS representation (Hω, πω, 	ω) of state ω ∈S(A)
and consider the Hilbert sum 
ω∈S(A) Hω. Its elements ⊕ω∈S(A)ψω := {ψω}ω∈S(A)
satisfy

ω∈S(A)
||ψω||2
ω < +∞.
(14.23)
The space 
ω∈S(A) Hω is a Hilbert space for the inner product
(ψ|ψ′) =

ω∈S(A)
(ψω|ψ′
ω)ω .
The universal representation of A is the representation:
 : A →B
⎛
⎝
ω∈S(A)
Hω
⎞
⎠
given by 
⎛
⎝
ω∈S(A)
ψω
⎞
⎠:=

ω∈S(A)
πω(a)ψω .
Deﬁnition 14.31 Let π : A →B(H) be a representation of the ∗-algebra A on the
Hilbert space H. A subrepresentation of π is a representation of the form π↾H0:
A →B(H0), where the subspace H0 ⊂H is closed and π-invariant.
Clearly any GNS representation of a C∗-algebra with unit is a subrepresentation of
the universal representation. Then the next easy, but useful, fact holds.

14.1 Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
899
Proposition 14.32 The universal representation of any given C∗-algebra with unit
is faithful and isometric.
Proof That a representation is faithful implies, by Theorem 8.22, that it is isometric.
Faithfulness descends immediately from the fact that , as a subrepresentation,
contains the representation π used in the proof of the Gelfand-Najmark theorem (the
latter is injective).
□
Eventually we mention a result on the structure of the folium of an algebraic state.
First, a notation and an important deﬁnition.
Notation 14.33 Let π : A →B(H) be a representation of the ∗-algebra A, and n a
cardinal number. We denote by nπ the representation on n
i=1 Hi, Hi := H deﬁned
by
nπ(a)(⊕n
i=1ψi) := ⊕n
i=1π(a)ψi
for any a ∈A, ψi ∈H .
■
Deﬁnition 14.34 Two representations π1 : A →B(H1), π2 : A →B(H2) of the
same ∗-algebra A are called quasi-equivalent, written
π1 ≈π2 ,
if they are unitarily equivalent up to multiplicities. Equivalently, there exists cardinals
n1, n2 such that n1π1 ≃n2π2.
For example
π : A →B(H) and π1 : A ∋a 
→π(a) ⊕Uπ(a)U −1 ∈B(H ⊕H′)
are quasi-equivalent if U : H →H′ is a unitary operator. Unitarily equivalent repre-
sentations are obviously quasi-equivalent. And quasi-equivalence is an equivalence
relation. About this (see [Haa96] and [BrRo02, vol. 1]) we have
Proposition 14.35 Let A be a C∗-algebra with unit and ω : A →C an algebraic
state with GNS representation πω.
(a) If π1 and π2 are representations of A, π1 ≈π2 if and only if the von Neumann alge-
bras π1(A)′′, π2(A)′′ are isomorphic as ∗-algebras, and the ∗-isomorphism restricts
to a ∗-isomorphism π1(A) →π2(A).
(b) The GNS representations of A generated by states in Fol(ω) are quasi-equivalent.
In particular, if ω = λω1 + (1 −λ)ω2, with λ ∈(0, 1) and ω1 ̸= ω, the GNS repre-
sentation of ω1 is unitarily equivalent to a GNS subrepresentation of ω.
(c) If π is a representation of A and π ≈πω, then π is a GNS representation of a
state in Fol(ω).

Example of a C∗-Algebra of Observables: The Weyl
C∗-Algebra
This section is devoted to the simplest non-trivial C∗-algebra of observables used
in physics. We are talking about the Weyl C∗-algebra involved in the description of
several systems, among which are non-interacting bosonic quantum systems. Almost
all systems that are describable using a Weyl C∗-algebra can also be described by
weakening the observables’ structure to a ∗-algebra. Yet Weyl C∗-algebras are math-
ematically attractive, which motivates our interest.
14.2.1
Further Properties of Weyl ∗-Algebras W (X, σ)
Keeping in mind Sect.11.5.4, let (X, σ) be a symplectic space: a pair consisting of a
real vector space X of even dimension (possibly inﬁnite), henceforth non-trivial, and
a weakly non-degenerate symplectic form σ : X × X →R. Let W (X, σ) denote the
Weyl ∗-algebra of (X, σ) introduced in Deﬁnition 11.47. We know (Theorem 11.48)
W (X, σ) is deﬁned up to ∗-isomorphisms. We wish to explain that it is possible, and
in a unique way, to enlarge W (X, σ) to a C∗-algebra called the Weyl C∗-algebra
associated to (X, σ). More precisely, we will deﬁne on W (X, σ) a unique norm
satisfying the C∗property ||a∗a|| = ||a||2. The Weyl C∗-algebra will be the comple-
tion of W (X, σ) for that norm. In order to prove all this we need a few preliminary
facts that form the contents of the section. There are various procedures, and dis-
tinct (equivalent) formulations, that prove the ensuing properties (see [BrRo02] in
particular). We will essentially follow the approach of [BGP07].
Lemma 14.36 Let X be a non-trivial real vector space, σ : X × X →R a weakly
non-degenerate symplectic form, and consider a Weyl ∗-algebra W (X, σ) associated
to the system.
(a) There exists a norm || || on W (X, σ) satisfying the C∗property: ||a∗a|| = ||a||2
for any a ∈W (X, σ).
(b) If ψ ∈X, the generator W(ψ) is unitary, so for the above norm ||W(ψ)|| = 1.
(c) If ψ, φ ∈X, ψ ̸= φ, in the above norm
||W(ψ) −W(φ)|| = 2 ,
so W (X, σ) is not separable.
(d) If we set, for any a ∈W (X, σ):
||a||c := sup{p(a) | p : W (X, σ) →[0, +∞) is a C∗norm} ,
then || ||c is a C∗norm.

14.2 Example of a C∗-Algebra of Observables: The Weyl C∗-Algebra
901
Proof (a) Let us focus again on the construction of W (X, σ) of Theorem 11.48(a).
Consider the complex Hilbert space H := L2(X, μ) where μ is the counting mea-
sure on X. For u ∈X the operators W(u) ∈B(L2(X, μ)), (W(u)ψ)(v) := eiσ(u,v)/2
ψ(u + v) for ψ ∈L2(X, μ), v ∈X, deﬁne a Weyl ∗-algebra associated to (X, σ):
W (X, σ) ⊂B(H). The norm || || of B(H) satisﬁes the C∗property. Starting from a
different representation W ′(X, σ), || || induces a C∗norm on W ′(X, σ) by means of
the ∗-isomorphism α : W (X, σ) →W ′(X, σ) of Theorem 11.48(c).
(b) From the Weyl relations we know W(ψ)W(ψ)∗= W ∗(ψ)W(ψ) = I, so W(ψ)
is unitary. The C∗property implies ||W(ψ)|| = 1.
(c) Let us complete W (X, σ) with respect to the norm || || of (a), so to obtain a C∗-
algebra.ByWeyl’srelationswehave W(χ)W(φ −ψ)W(χ)−1 = e−iσ(χ,φ−ψ)W(φ −
ψ). Since W(φ −ψ) is unitary, σ(W(φ −ψ)) ⊂{z ∈C | |z| = 1}. By deﬁnition of
spectrum
σ(W(χ)W(φ −ψ)W(χ)−1) = σ(W(φ −ψ)) = e−iσ(χ,φ−ψ)σ(W(φ −ψ)) .
Since ψ ̸= φ, σ(χ, φ −ψ) covers the whole R as χ varies in X. Hence σ(W(φ −
ψ)) = {z ∈C | |z| = 1}. Therefore σ(eiσ(ψ,φ)W(φ −ψ) −I) is the unit circle in
C centred at −1, so if r is the spectral radius, then r(eiσ(ψ,φ)W(φ −ψ)) = 2. But
eiσ(ψ,φ)W(φ −ψ)isnormal:2 = r(eiσ(ψ,φ)W(φ −ψ)) = ||eiσ(ψ,φ)W(φ −ψ) −I||.
Using the norm’s C∗property and the generators’ unitarity, the Weyl identities imply
that ||W(φ) −W(ψ)||2 equals
||(W(φ)∗−W(ψ)∗)(W(φ) −W(ψ))|| = ||eiσ(ψ,φ)W(φ −ψ) −I|| = 4 .
There are uncountably many elements ψ ∈X (X ̸= {0} by assumption), so W (X, σ)
is not separable: if S ⊂X were dense, there would be an element of S inside the
ball of radius 1/2 centred at each W(ψ). As said balls do not intersect, S cannot be
countable.
(d) Every property of a norm, plus the C∗property ||a∗a||c = ||a||2
c, hold by direct
inspection. The only thing left is to show that the supremum deﬁning ||a||c is ﬁnite.
To this end, on W (X, σ) we have a norm (not C∗in general): || 
i aiW(ψi)||0 :=

i |ai|. As every W(ψ) has unit norm in any C∗norm p, as seen in (b), we have
p(a) ≤||a||0 < +∞. Therefore the least upper bound in ||a||c is smaller than ||a||0,
hence is ﬁnite.
□
Lemma 14.37 Let (X, σ) be a non-trivial, weakly non-degenerate real symplectic
space, W (X, σ) a Weyl ∗-algebra associated to (X, σ). Denote by CW (X, σ) the C∗
completion of W (X, σ) in the norm || ||c of Lemma 14.36(d).
Then CW (X, σ) is simple: it does not admit two-sided closed ideals that are
invariant under the involution, other than {0} and CW (X, σ) itself.
Proof Write A for the C∗-algebra with unit obtained by completion of W (X, σ)
under || ||c. Suppose I ⊂A is a closed, two-sided ideal that is ∗-invariant. Then

I0 := I ∩{cW(0) | c ∈C} is a complex subspace of {cW(0) | c ∈C} identiﬁed with
C. Hence I0 = {0} or I0 = {cW(0) | c ∈C}. In the latter case I would then contain
I, so it would coincide with A. So assume I0 = {0} and consider the map:
P : W (X, σ) →{cW(0) | c ∈C} , with
P
⎛
⎝
φ∈F⊂X
W(φ)

⎠= a0W(0) in case F ⊂X is ﬁnite .
We claim P is bounded, and that it extends continuously to an operator, P, deﬁned
on A. To do so let us realise W (X, σ) in the C∗-algebra of operators B(L2(X, μ)), as
in the proof of Lemma 14.36(a). Call δ0 ∈L2(X, μ) the map δ0(0) = 1, δ0(φ) = 0
for φ ̸= 0. For a = 
φ∈F⊂X aφW(φ) and ψ ∈X we have


φ∈F⊂X
aφeiσ(φ,ψ)/2δ0(φ + ψ)
= a−ψeiσ(−ψ,ψ)/2 = a−ψ .
Consequently
(δ0|aδ0)L2(X,μ) =

ψ∈X
δ0(ψ)(aδ0)(ψ) = (aδ0)(0) = a0 .
In addition, ||δ0|| = 1, so
||P(a)||c = ||a0W(0)||c = |a0| = |(δ0|aδ0)L2| ≤||a||op ≤||a||c ,
proving P extends to a bounded operator on A.
Take now a ∈I ⊂A and ﬁx ε > 0. Write
a = a0W(0) +

a je−iσ(ψ,φ j)/2W(φ j) + r(ψ) ,
since
||r(φ)||c = ||W(ψ)rW(−ψ)||c ≤||r||c < ε .

and eventually obtain, for some rn with ||rn||c < ε:
a0W(0) + rn ∈I .
As ε > 0 is arbitrary and I closed, we conclude P(a) = a0W(0) ∈I0, so a0 = 0.
With ψ ∈X and a = 
φ aφW(φ) ∈I arbitrary, we similarly have W(ψ)a ∈I,
whence P(W(ψ)a) = 0. This means a−ψ = 0 for any ψ ∈X, so a = 0. Therefore
I = {0}, ending the proof.
□
Now to the key theorem on Weyl C∗-algebras of a given symplectic space.
Theorem 14.38 Let (X, σ) be a non-trivial weakly non-degenerate real symplectic
space, and consider a Weyl ∗-algebra W (X, σ) associated to (X, σ).
(a) There exist a unique norm on W (X, σ) satisfying the C∗property:
||a∗a|| = ||a||2 for any a ∈W (X, σ).
(b) Let CW (X, σ) be the C∗-algebra completion of W (X, σ) for the C∗norm of (a).
If W ′(X, σ) is another Weyl ∗-algebra associated to the same space (X, σ) and || ||′
the unique C∗norm, call CW ′(X, σ) the corresponding C∗-algebra with unit.
Then there is a unique isometric ∗-isomorphism γ : CW (X, σ) →CW ′(X, σ)
such that:
γ (W(ψ)) = W ′(ψ) for any ψ ∈X,
where W(ψ), W ′(ψ) are generators of the Weyl ∗-algebras W (X, σ), W ′(X, σ).
Proof (a) By Theorem 11.48(c) it is known that two Weyl ∗-algebras W (X, σ),
W ′(X, σ)onthesamesymplecticspaceare ∗-isomorphicundersomeα : W (X, σ) →
W ′(X, σ) that is totally determined by α(W(ψ)) = W ′(ψ), ψ ∈X. Equip W (X, σ),

The kernel of α is a closed ∗-invariant two-sided ideal, hence trivial by the pre-
vious lemma. In conclusion α is one-to-one and an isometry by Theorem 8.22(a).
Suppose now W (X, σ) = W ′(X, σ), so || || = || ||′ too. Then α has to be the iden-
tity, extending to the identity α, and also isometric by the above argument. So,
|| ||c = || ||′ = || || is the only C∗norm on W (X, σ).
(b) We have to prove that the ∗-isomorphism α : W (X, σ) →W ′(X, σ), deter-
mined by α(W(ψ)) = W ′(ψ), ψ ∈X, extends to a ∗-isomorphism between the
C∗-algebras CW (X, σ) and CW ′(X, σ). The same argument used above (now
we do know || || = || ||c) shows that α extends to an injective ∗-homomorphism
γ : CW (X, σ) →CW ′(X, σ). On the other hand we can swap W (X, σ) and
W ′(X, σ), and extend α′ : W ′(X, σ) →W (X, σ), determined by α′(W ′(ψ)) =
W(ψ), ψ ∈X, to γ ′ : CW ′(X, σ) →CW (X, σ). By construction α′α = idW (X,σ),
αα′ = idW ′(X,σ). These relations continue to hold, by continuity, when extended
to γ ′γ = idCW (X,σ), γ γ ′ = idCW ′(X,σ). Therefore γ is onto, as well, and thus a ∗-
isomorphism.

14.2.2
The Weyl C∗-Algebra CW (X, σ)
By keeping Theorem 14.38 into account, we can deﬁne Weyl C∗-algebras.
Deﬁnition 14.39 Let X be a non-trivial real vector space equipped with a weakly
non-degenerate symplectic form σ : X × X →R. The Weyl C∗-algebra CW (X, σ)
associated to (X, σ) is a C∗-algebra with unit generated by non-zero elements W(ψ),
ψ ∈X, satisfying the Weyl relations:
W(ψ)W(ψ′) = e−i
2 σ(ψ,ψ′)W(ψ + ψ′) ,
W(ψ)∗= W(−ψ) ,
ψ, ψ ∈X .
This notion is well deﬁned, and as consequence of Theorem 14.38 we obtain the
following result. It shows that the Weyl C∗-algebra is unique up to ∗-isomorphisms.
Theorem 14.40 Let (X, σ) be a non-trivial weakly non-degenerate real symplectic
space, CW (X, σ) a Weyl C∗-algebra associated to it.
(a) If CW ′(X, σ) is a second Weyl C∗-algebra associated to (X, σ), there exists a
unique (isometric) ∗-isomorphism γ : CW (X, σ) →CW ′(X, σ) such that
γ (W(ψ)) = W ′(ψ) for any ψ ∈X,

where W(ψ), W ′(ψ) generate the Weyl ∗-algebras W (X, σ), W ′(X, σ) respectively.
(b) CW (X, σ) is simple: there are no non-trivial closed, ∗-invariant two-sided ideals.
(c) If CW (X′, σ ′) is the Weyl C∗-algebra associated to the weakly non-degenerate
symplectic space (X′, σ ′) and f : X →X′ a symplectic linear map, there is a unique
injective and isometric ∗-homomorphism γ f : CW (X, σ) →CW (X′, σ ′) such that:
γ f (W(ψ)) = W ′( f (ψ)) for any ψ ∈X.
Furthermore, γ f (CW (X, σ)) is a unital C∗-subalgebra of CW (X′, σ ′).
Proof Items (a) and (b) were proven with Theorem 14.38. Let us see to (c). By The-
orem 11.48(f) there is one injective ∗-homomorphism α f : W (X, σ) →W (X′, σ ′)
such that α f (W(ψ)) = W ′( f (ψ)), ψ ∈X. The C∗norm || ||′ on CW (X′, σ ′)
induces a C∗norm on W (X, σ), ||a|| = ||α f (a)||′. By uniqueness of the C∗norm on
a Weyl ∗-algebra, the latter coincides with the original norm of CW (X, σ). Hence
α f is isometric and continuous, and extends continuously to an isometric (so injec-
tive) ∗-homomorphism γ f : CW (X, σ) →CW (X′, σ ′). That γ f (CW (X, σ)) is a
C∗-subalgebra with unit in CW (X′, σ ′) follows from Theorem 8.22(b).

Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
For given solutions X, one can prove that the symplectic form does not depend
on the choice of t ∈R by the nature of the Klein-Gordon equation itself. The C∗-
algebra CW (X, σ) is the algebra of observables of the Klein-Gordon quantum ﬁeld
φ, and can be taken as the starting point for the procedure of “second quantisa-
tion” of bosonic ﬁelds. In this case an algebraic state of paramount importance is
the so-called Minkowski vacuum, i.e. the Gaussian state (see Remark 14.41) deter-
mined by a special μ that takes spatial Fourier transforms of solutions at time t = 0.
This particular state represents the absence of particles, and is invariant under the
Poincaré group. In the GNS representation of the state, the Weyl generators have the
form πωμ(W(φ)) = ei(φ). The self-adjoint operator (φ) is called operator of the
ﬁeld of second quantisation. There exists a well-known generalisation of all these
notions to Quantum Field Theory in curved spacetime (see [Wal94, KhMo15] for an
introductory review).

14.3
Introduction to Quantum Symmetries Within the
Algebraic Formulation
In this section we brieﬂy discuss how quantum symmetries are dealt with in the
algebraic formulation [Haa96, Str05b]. After recalling the basic notions, we will
prove two theorems about the (anti-)unitary representation of symmetries on the
GNS space of an invariant algebraic state. The strategy allows to describe precisely, in
mathematical terms, the concept known as the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry.
14.3.1
The Algebraic Formulation’s Viewpoint on Quantum
Symmetries
Consider a quantum system S described by the unital C∗-algebra AS of observables.
Said better, the observables are the self-adjoint elements of AS. A quantum symmetry
α should be seen either as a ∗-automorphism α : AS →AS, i.e. as a bijective ∗-
homomorphism (hence isometric), or as a ∗-anti-automorphism.
Deﬁnition 14.43 If A is a C∗-algebra with unit I, a ∗-anti-automorphism is a
bijective, antilinear isometry α : A →A such that α(I) = I, α(a∗) = α(a)∗and
α(ab) = α(a)α(b), for any a, b ∈A.
The above deﬁnition of algebraic symmetry has a “psychological explanation” based
on the notion of quantum symmetry when the theory is formulated on a Hilbert space
(and recalling the theorems of Wigner and Kadison). Fix a GNS triple (Hω, πω, 	ω),
suppose the GNS representation πω : AS →B(H) is injective (always the case if
AS is simple, as we said in Sect.14.1.6), and represent the symmetry on Hω by the
operator U, which is unitary or anti-unitary. Then we can set

a ∈AS,
where, mimicking the previous section’s deﬁnition, the action γ of the symmetry U
on observables is the inverse dual action (12.22)
γ ∗−1(A) := U AU −1 .
The map α is well deﬁned, and gives a ∗-automorphism or ∗-anti-automorphism
provided U · U −1 maps observables (seen as operators) to observables, as is only
natural to suppose. The reason for preferring the inverse dual action to the dual action
(12.21) will be clear when we pass to representations of groups of symmetries.
Here is the formal deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 14.44 Let S be a physical system described by the unital C∗-algebra of
observables AS. An (algebraic) quantum symmetry of S is a ∗-automorphism or a
∗-anti-automorphism α : As →As.
This naturally begs a question: given a symmetry α and an algebraic state ω, under
which assumptions is α representable by a unitary, or anti-unitary, operator on the
Hilbert space Hω of the GNS representation of ω? The next theorem is a big step
forward in this direction.
Theorem 14.45 Let α be an algebraic quantum symmetry of system S, described
by the unital C∗-algebra AS of observables. Suppose ω is an α-invariant algebraic
state on AS:
ω(α(a)) = ω(a) for a ∈AS with a = a∗.
(14.24)
If (Hω, πω, 	ω) is the GNS triple of ω, there exists only one operator Uα : Hω →Hω,
unitary or anti-unitary according to whether α is linear or antilinear, such that:
Uα	ω = 	ω and Uαπω(a)U −1
α
= πω(α(a)) ,
a ∈AS.
(14.25)
Remark 14.46 Since any a ∈AS can be written as a = a1 + ia∗
2 with a1, a2 self-
adjoint, and ω(a∗) = ω(a) for any state ω (straightforward from the GNS theo-
rem), ω being α-invariant is the same as imposing ω(α(a)) = ω(a) if α is linear, or
ω(α(a)) = ω(a), if α is antilinear, for any a ∈AS.
Proof of theorem 14.45. The idea is to deﬁne Uα ﬁrst on the dense space π(AS)	ω
by
Uπω(a)	ω := πω(α(a))	ω ,
(14.26)
and then extend it continuously to Hω, interpreting the result as Uα. The deﬁnition of
U is unambiguous if πω(a)	ω = πω(a′)	ω implies πω(α(a))	ω = πω(α(a′))	ω,
i.e. if πω(b)	ω = 0 implies πω(α(b))	ω = 0. But this is true by the GNS theorem
and the invariance of ω:
||πω(α(b))	ω||2 = (πω(α(b))	ω|πω(α(b))	ω)

908
14
Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
= (	ω|πω(α(b∗))πω(α(b))	ω)
= (	ω|πω(α(b∗b))	ω) = ω(α(b∗b)) = ω(b∗b) = (	ω|πω(b∗b)	ω)
= ||πω(b)	ω||2 .
By construction U, as in (14.26), is linear or antilinear depending on how α is.
Moreover, it is isometric/anti-isometric, if α is a ∗-isomorphism/anti-isomorphism
respectively. Hence it is continuous, for above computations show that
||Uπω(b)	ω||2 = ||πω(b)	ω||2 .
We extend U by continuity to Hω, since π(AS)	ω is dense in H, and obtain a
linear/antilinear operator Uα : Hω →Hω preserving the norms. Our Uα is onto, as
inverse of the analogous uniquely-deﬁned extension of
U −1
α πω(a)	ω = πω(α−1(a))	ω .
(14.27)
ThereforeUα : Hω →Hω is well deﬁned, unitary/anti-unitary if α is linear/antilinear,
and (14.25) are true. The ﬁrst condition is trivially true if we set b = I in (14.26). As
for the second one, put a = bc in (14.27):
Uαπω(b)πω(c)	ω = πω(α(b))πω(α(c))	ω .
Using (14.26):
Uαπω(b)U −1
α πω(α(c))	ω = πω(α(b))πω(α(c))	ω .
That is to say, if  ∈πω(α(AS))	ω = πω(AS)	ω:
Uαπω(b)U −1
α  = πω(α(b))U −1
α  .
Since πω(AS)	ω is dense in Hω, the second identity in (14.25) holds. Uniqueness
is patent by construction, because if U ′ satisﬁes (14.25) (U ′ replacing Uα) it must
satisfy (14.27) as well (U ′ replacing Uα). This fact determines it completely.
□
Remark 14.47 (1) A system S may admit an algebraic symmetry α that is not repre-
sentable unitarily (or anti-unitarily) on the Hilbert space of the theory (e.g., a GNS
representation of a reference algebraic state ω). If so, the symmetry α is said to
have been broken spontaneously by the representation employed. The phenom-
enon of spontaneous symmetry breaking is hugely important in particle physics
and statistical mechanics [Str05b].

(2) An alternate deﬁnition for a ∗-anti-automorphism [BrRo02, Ara09] is a linear
map α : A →A such that α(ab) = α(b)α(a) for every a, b ∈A. With this deﬁnition,
if ω is ﬁxed under the action of α, the corresponding part of Theorem 14.45 holds
anyway, with the same hypothesis, and this change: there is an anti-unitary operator
Uα : Hω →Hω such that
Uα	ω = 	ω

(14.28)
wherewestressthepresenceofa∗inplaceofa inthesecondidentitywhencomparing
to (14.25). The proof is evident if we observe that α′(a) := α(a)∗, for a ranging in A,
deﬁnes a ∗-automorphism in accordance with Deﬁnition 14.43, and Theorem 14.45
is valid if α leaves ω invariant. This alternative but essentially equivalent deﬁnition
of ∗-anti-automorphism can be exploited when one deals with real ∗-algebras or other
algebraic structures deﬁned over the ﬁeld of real numbers.

14.3.2
(Topological) Symmetry Groups in the Algebraic
Formalism
We want to show, concisely, how Theorem 14.45, proven in Sect.14.3.1 in the alge-
braic formalism, generalises naturally to the situation where the algebraic symmetry
α is replaced by an algebraic symmetry group.
So take a quantum system S described, in the algebraic formalism, by the unital
C∗-algebra AS, whose self-adjoint elements are the system’s observables. Suppose
there is a representation α : G ∋g 
→αg of the group G in terms of ∗-automorphisms
αg of AS. If ω is an invariant algebraic state, Theorem 14.45 guarantees every αg
is representable by a unitary operator Uαg on the Hilbert space Hω of the GNS
representation of ω. We will show that this correspondence produces automatically
a unitary representation of G, without the need to redeﬁne the phases of the unitary
maps Ug. This representation is also strongly continuous under a certain hypothesis.
Theorem 14.48 Let S be a quantum system described, in the algebraic formalism,
by the unital C∗-algebra AS, and let G be a group with a representation
α : G ∋g 
→αg
by ∗-automorphisms αg of AS. Suppose ω is a G-invariant algebraic state on S
represented by α:
ω(αg(a)) = ω(a) for any g ∈G, a ∈AS with a = a∗.
(14.29)
(a) If Uαg : Hω →Hω is the unitary operator associated to the ∗-automorphism αg
by Theorem 14.45 (as the unique unitary extension of the operator in (14.26) with
α = αg), for any g ∈G the map

910
14
Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
G ∋g 
→Uαg
(14.30)
is a unitary representation of G on Hω.
(b) If G is a topological group, G ∋g 
→ω(a∗αg(a)) is continuous for any given
a ∈AS if and only if the representation (14.30) is strongly continuous.
Proof Consider the operators Uαg deﬁned by Theorem 14.45. By assumption, since
Uαh	ω = 	ω so 	ω = U −1
αh 	ω, we have:
UαgUαhπω(a)	ω = UαgUαhπω(a)U −1
αh 	ω = Uαgπω(αh(a))	ω
= Uαgπω(αh(a))U −1
αg 	ω = πω(αg(αh(a)))	ω = πω((αg ◦αh)(a))	ω =
= πω(αg·h(a))	ω = Uαg·hπω(a)U −1
αg·h	ω = Uαg·hπω(a)	ω .
As πω(AS)	ω is dense in HS, then UαgUαh = Uαgh. Similarly we can prove U −1
αg =
Uαg−1 and Uαe = I. In other terms (14.30) is a unitary representation of G.
Now assume G is a topological group and G ∋g 
→ω(a∗αg(a)) is continuous
for every a ∈AS. By the GNS theorem, and the fact that Uαg	ω = 	ω, this implies
G ∋g 
→ω(a∗αg(a)) = (πω(a)	ω|Uαgπω(a)	ω) is a continuous function. But a ∈
AS is generic, so we have proved that for every  in the dense space πω(AS)	ω,
G ∋g 
→(|Uαg) is continuous. Using that Uαg is unitary, it is easy to see that,
consequently:
||Uαg −Uαg′||2 = ||Uαg·g′−1  −||2 →0
as g →g′, for any  in the dense subspace πω(AS)	ω. Therefore G ∋g 
→Uαg is
strongly continuous on the dense space πω(AS)	ω. This generalises to the generic
vector 	 ∈HS as follows. For every ε > 0 we can ﬁnd  ∈πω(AS)	ω so that ||	 −
|| < 2ε/3. For such , there is a neighbourhood Ig′ of g′ in G such that ||Uαg −
Uαg′|| < ε/3 if g ∈Ig′. Hence for g′ ∈G and any ε > 0 there is a neighbourhood
Ig′ of g′ such that:
||Uαg	 −Uαg′	|| ≤||Uαg	 −Uαg|| + ||Uαg −Uαg′|| + ||Uαg′ −Uαg′	||
= ||	 −|| + ||Uαg −Uαg′|| + || −	|| < ε
for g ∈Ig′. To conclude, observe that if G ∋g 
→Uαg is strongly continuous, then
G ∋g 
→ω(a∗αg(a)) = (πω(a)	ω|Uαgπω(a)	ω) is continuous for every a ∈AS.
This ends the proof.
□
Remark 14.49 (1) We could also decide to make the algebraic symmetry α in The-
orem 14.45 act in the GNS representation by means of the dual action (12.21) of
Uα:
πω(α(a)) = U −1
α πω(a)Uα ,

14.3 Introduction to Quantum Symmetries Within the Algebraic Formulation
911
simply redeﬁning as U −1
α
the previous Uα. With this choice, Theorem 14.48 remains
valid provided we assume that the representation G ∋g 
→αg of ∗-automorphisms
of A is a right representation (Sect.12.2.2) instead of a standard left representation:
αe = id, αg−1 = α−1
g , but
αg ◦αh = αh·g
g, h ∈G .
In the algebraic formulation, where the focus is more on observables than on states,
one normally adopts the viewpoint based on inverse dual actions to deal with stan-
dard representations in terms of automorphisms instead of the more exotic right
representations.
This happens especially for the quantum ﬁeld operators introduced in Example
14.42 (e.g., see [KhMo15] Proposition 5.1.17 and Sect.5.2.7):
αg(W(φ)) = W(φ ◦g−1)
where g ∈G, G is the isometry group (Poincaré group) of Minkowski spacetime
M and W(φ) is the Weyl element associated to the solution φ of the Klein–Gordon
equation. In the GNS representation of an isometry-invariant state ωM, the Gaussian
Poincaré vacuum, we therefore have
πωM(W(φ ◦g−1)) = πωM(αg(W(φ))) = UgπωM(W(φ))U −1
g
.
(14.31)
Passing to the exponential description πωM(W(φ)) = ei(φ) in the GNS Hilbert space
of ωM, we easily obtain
(φ ◦g−1) = Ug(φ)U −1
g
.
Within this formalism, Heisenberg’s evolution is nothing but the inverse dual action
on observables of the time displacement symmetry (Remark 13.1(4)) contained in G.
(2) In case G is the topological group R, right and standard representations coincide.
If {αt}t∈R satisﬁes part (b) for the invariant state ω, Stone’s theorem warrants that the
one-parameter unitary group {Ut}t∈R representing R (πω(αt(a)) = Utπω(a)U −1
t
)
admits a self-adjoint generator H : D(H) →Hω deﬁned on the dense domain
D(H) ⊂Hω, for which Ut = eit H. Then we may think of {αt}t∈R as a one-parameter
group of ∗-automorphisms that describes the time evolution of the observables of the
system with the parameter t as time. This is the algebraic correspondent of Heisen-
berg’s time evolution of observables, namely, the algebraic analogue of the inverse
dual action of the time displacement symmetry R ∋t 
→e+it H acting on states, as
remarked above.
By Stone’s theorem, the ﬁrst condition in (14.25) implies 	ω ∈D(H) and
H	ω = 0, so 0 ∈σp(H). If σ(H) ⊂[0, +∞) (and sometimes one further requires
dim(Ker(H)) = 1), ω is called a ground state for the time evolution {αt}t∈R.

912
14
Introduction to the Algebraic Formulation of Quantum Theories
(3) One may try to prove an analogous theorem for representations G ∋g 
→αg,
where each αg is either a ∗-automorphism or a ∗-anti-automorphism. We shall not
address this issue here. We only observe that if every element g ∈G can be written
as product of squares g = g2
1 · · · g2
n, as happens for R and connected Lie groups, then
every αg must be linear since αg = α2
g1 ◦· · · ◦α2
gn is linear, no matter whether every
αgk is linear or antilinear. So, in a representation of a Lie group, ∗-anti-automorphisms
(and the corresponding anti-unitary operators) may show up only if the group is not
connected.
■
Condition (b) in Theorem 14.48 seems non-physical, as it does not concern physically
accessible quantities in an evident way. A continuity condition should be formulated
in terms of physical quantities like expectation values. As a matter of fact it is
possible to reformulate the theorem and replace condition (b) by a more meaningful
request, physically. To this end we note that given a state ω on a unital C∗-algebra AS
representing a physical quantum system, and having chosen b ∈AS with ω(b∗b) ̸= 0
(which is equivalent to πω(b)	ω ̸= 0), the functional
AS ∋a 
→ωb(a) := ω(b∗ab)
ω(b∗b)
(14.32)
is still a state. Its meaning is clearer when we pass to the GNS representation of ω
where, by construction, we immediately ﬁnd
ωb(a) = (πω(b)	ω|πω(a)πω(b)	ω)
||πω(b)	ω||2
.
We see in this way that ωb is a state in the folium of ω. The ﬁnite span Dω of the
vectors associated to these states is the one used to construct the Hilbert Hω space of
the GNS Theorem 14.4 as Hω = Dω.
If we keep all other hypotheses in Theorem14.48, condition (b) can be replaced
by the equivalent demand that the expectation values, with respect to those states, of
every observable a = a∗∈AS subjected to the action αg of the group are continuous
functions of g ∈G. We have the following physically-enhanced version of Theorem
14.48.
Proposition 14.50 Let S be a quantum system described, in the algebraic formalism,
by the unital C∗-algebra AS, and let G be a topological group with a representation
α : G ∋g 
→αg by ∗-automorphisms αg of AS. Suppose ω is a G-invariant algebraic
state on S represented by α as in (14.29), and that U : G ∋g 
→Uαg is the unitary
representation of G as in (14.30).
The following facts are equivalent.
(a) U is strongly continuous.
(b) The map
G ∋g 
→ω(a∗αg(a)) ∈C
is continuous for any given a ∈AS.

14.3 Introduction to Quantum Symmetries Within the Algebraic Formulation
913
(c) The map
G ∋g 
→ωb(αg(a)) ∈C
is continuous for any given a = a∗∈AS and any b ∈AS with ω(b∗b) ̸= 0 as in
(14.32) inducing the state ωb.
Proof We already know that (a) and (b) are equivalent. Moreover, (b) implies (c)
because
ωb(αg(a)) =
(πω(b)	ω|Ugπω(a)U −1
g πω(b)	ω)
||πω(b)	ω||2
(14.33)
and G ∋g 
→Ug is strongly continuous. Suppose (c) holds so that all maps (14.32)
are continuous. From (14.33), we conclude, for every vector  in the dense linear
space Dω spanned by all πω(b)	ω, that the function
G ∋g 
→(|Uαgπω(a)U −1
αg )
(14.34)
is continuous for every a = a∗∈AS. Observing in particular that πω(a) = πω(a)∗,
it is easy to prove that the form
⟨, ′⟩a,g := (|Uαgπω(a)U −1
g ′)
is linear in the right entry, antilinear in the left one and ⟨, ′⟩a,g = ⟨′, ⟩a,g. By
polarisation, we conclude that also the map
G ∋g 
→(|Uαgπω(a)U −1
αg ′)
is continuous, if , ′ ∈Dω. Taking ′ = 	ω (corresponding to b = I), since
Uαg	ω = 	ω, we have that
G ∋g 
→(|Uαgπω(a)	ω)
(14.35)
iscontinuous.Bylinearitytheself-adjointelementa canbereplacedwithanyelement
of AS. Since  is a ﬁnite linear combination of vectors πω(a)	ω with a ∈AS, we
can replace πω(a)	ω in (14.35) with  itself, and preserve continuity. Hence
G ∋g 
→(|Uαg)
is continuous for every  ranging in a dense space. Here the argument used in the
proof of Theorem 14.48 also proves that G ∋g 
→Uαg is continuous, and therefore
(a) is true.

Order Relations and Groups
A.1
Order Relations, Posets, Zorn’s Lemma
A relation ≥on an arbitrary set X is called a partial order (relation) if it is reﬂexive
(x ≥x, ∀x ∈X), transitive (x ≥y ≥z ⇒x ≥z, ∀x, y, z ∈X) and skew-symmetric
(x ≥y ≥x ⇒x = y, ∀x, y ∈X). The pair (X, ≥) is then said a partially ordered
set (shortened to poset).
An equivalent writing of a ≥b is b ≤a.
The partial order ≥is a total order if, further, either x ≥y or y ≥x for any
x, y ∈X.
If (X, ≥) is a partially ordered set:
(i) Y ⊂X is upper bounded (resp. lower bounded) if it admits an upper bound
(lower bound), i.e. an element x ∈X such that x ≥y (y ≥x) for any y ∈Y;
(ii) an element x0 ∈X for which there is no element x ̸= x0 in X such that x ≥x0 is
maximal in X. (Note that for us a maximal element in X may not be an upper bound
in X).
If (X, ≥) is a poset, a subset Y ⊂X is (totally) ordered if the relation ≥, restricted
to Y × Y, is a total order.
Recall that Zorn’s lemma is an equivalent statement to the Axiom of Choice (or
to the well-ordering axiom).
Theorem A.1 (“Zorn’s lemma”) If any ordered subset in a poset (X, ≥) is upper
bounded, X admits a maximal element.
Among the various notions related to posets (X, ≥), those of supremum and inﬁmum
are useful:
(i) a is called a least upper bound (or supremum, or just sup) of the set A ⊂X,
written a = sup A, if a is an upper bound of A and any other upper bound a′ of A
satisﬁes a ≤a′;
(ii) a is called a greatest lower bound, (or inﬁmum or inf) of A ⊂X, written
a = inf A, if a is a lower bound for A and any other lower bound a′ satisﬁes a′ ≤a;
It is immediate to see that any subset A ⊂X has at most one least upper bound and
one greatest lower bound.

Round-up on Group Theory
A group is an algebraic structure (G, ◦) consisting in a set G and an operation
◦: G × G →G (the composition law, often called product) satisfying three
properties:
(1) ◦is associative
g1 ◦(g2 ◦g3) = (g1 ◦g2) ◦g3 ,
for any
g1, g2, g3 ∈G ;
(2) there exists an element e ∈G, variously called identity, neutral element or unit,
such that
e ◦g = g ◦e = g ,
for any
g ∈G ;
(3) each element g ∈G admits an inverse, i.e.
for any
g ∈G
there exists
g−1 ∈G
such that
g ◦g−1 = g−1 ◦g = e .
The identity and the inverse to a given element are easily seen to be unique.
A group (G, ◦) is commutative or Abelian if g ◦g′ = g′ ◦g for any g, g′ ∈G;
otherwise it is noncommutative or non-Abelian.
A subset G′ ⊂G in a group is a subgroup if it becomes a group with the product
of G restricted to G′ × G′. A subgroup N in a group G is normal if it is invariant
under conjugation, i.e. for any n ∈N and g ∈G the conjugate element g ◦n ◦g−1
belongs to N. A group is said to be simple if it does not admit normal subgroups
different from {e} and itself.
If N is a normal subgroup in G, then G/N denotes the quotient, i.e. the collection
of cosets in G deﬁned by the equivalence relation g ∼g′
⇔g = ng′ for some
n ∈N. It is easy to prove that G/N inherits a natural group structure from G.
The centre Z of G is the commutative subgroup of G made by elements z that
commute with every group element: z ∈Z ⇔z ◦g = g ◦z for any g ∈G.
If (G1, ◦1) and (G2, ◦2) are two groups, a (group) homomorphism from G1 to
G2 is a map h : G1 →G2 that preserves the group structure, i.e.:
h(g ◦1 g′) = h(g) ◦2 h(g′)
for any
g, g′ ∈G1 .
Using obvious notation, it is clear that h(e1) = e2 and h(g−11) = (h(g))−12 for any
g ∈G1.
The kernel Ker(h) ⊂G of a homomorphism h : G →G′ is the pre-image under
h of the identity e′ of G′, i.e. the set of elements g such that h(g) = e′. Notice Ker(h)
is a normal subgroup. Clearly h is one-to-one if and only if its kernel contains the
identity of G only. Moreover, the image h(G) of a homomorphism h : G →G′ is a
subgroup of G′ isomorphic to G/Ker(h).

Appendix A: Order Relations and Groups
917
A group isomorphism is a bijective group homomorphism. An isomorphism
h : G →G is an automorphism of G. The set Aut(G) of automorphisms of G is
itself a group under the composition of maps.
If (G1, ◦1), (G2, ◦2) are groups, the direct product G1 ⊗G2 is a group with the
following structure. Its elements are the pairs (g1, g2) of the Cartesian product of
the sets G1, G2. The composition law is
(g1, g2) ◦( f1, f2) := (g1 ◦1 f1, g2 ◦2 f2) ∀(g1, g2), ( f1, f2) ∈G1 × G2 .
The neutral element is obviously (e1, e2), where e1, e2 are the identities of G1, G2.
Moreover, G1 and G2 can be identiﬁed with normal subgroups of G1 ⊗G2.
The ensuing generalisation of the direct product plays a big role in physical ap-
plications. Let (G1, ◦1), (G2, ◦2) be groups and suppose that for any g1 ∈G1 there
is a group isomorphism ψg1 : G2 →G2 such that:
(i) ψg1 ◦ψg′
1 = ψg1◦1g′
1,
(ii) ψe1 = idG2,
where ◦is the composition of functions and e1 the neutral element in G1. (Equiv-
alently, ψg ∈
Aut(G2) for any g ∈G1, and the map G1 ∋g →ψg is
a group homomorphism G1 →Aut(G2).) We can endow the Cartesian prod-
uct G1 × G2 with a group structure simply by deﬁning the composition law on
(g1, g2), ( f1, f2) ∈G1 × G2 as
(g1, g2) ◦ψ ( f1, f2) := (g1 ◦1 f1, g2 ◦2 ψg1( f2)) .
The operation is well deﬁned, so (G1 ⊗ψ G2, ◦ψ) is a group called the semidirect
product of G1 and G2 by ψ. The order of the factors in the product is clearly relevant.
One can prove N is a normal subgroup of G ⊗ψ N, and
ψg(n) = g ◦ψ n ◦ψ g−1
for any g ∈G, n ∈N.
There is also a converse of sorts. Consider a group (H, ◦), let G be a subgroup of H
and N a normal subgroup. Assume N ∩G = {e}, e being the identity of H. Suppose
also H = GN, meaning that any h ∈H is the product h = gn of an element g ∈G
and some n ∈N. Then one can prove that the pair (g, n) is uniquely determined by
h, and H is isomorphic to the semidirect product G ⊗ψ N with
ψg(n) := g ◦h ◦g−1
for any g ∈G, n ∈N.
Now take a vector space V (real or complex). The group of bijective linear maps
f : V →V with the usual composition law is indicated by GL(V), and is called the
(general) linear group of V.
If V := Rn or Cn then GL(V) is denoted by GL(n, R) or GL(n, C), respectively.

918
Appendix A: Order Relations and Groups
Let us deﬁne linear representations of a group. Take a group (G, ◦) and a vector
space V. A (linear, left) representation of G on V is a homomorphism ρ : G →
GL(V).
A representation ρ : G →GL(V) is called:
(1) faithful if it is injective;
(2) free if the subgroup made of elements hv such that ρ(hv)v = v is trivial for any
v ∈V \ {0}, i.e. it contains only the neutral element of G;
(3) transitive if, for any v, v′ ∈V \ {0} there exists g ∈G with v′ = ρ(g)v;
(4) irreducible if there exists no proper subspace S ⊂V that is invariant under the
action of ρ(G), i.e. ρ(g)S ⊂S for any g ∈G.
In case V is a Hilbert or Banach space and ρ(G) are bounded operators on the
entire space V, the representation is said topologically irreducible if there are no
closed ρ(G)-invariant subspaces in V.

Elements of Differential Geometry
Let n, m = 1, 2, . . ., k = 0, 1, . . . be ﬁxed integers and Ω ⊂Rn an open, non-empty
set. A map f : Ω →Rm is of class Ck (or simply Ck), written f ∈Ck(Ω; Rn), if
all partial derivatives of the components of f are continuous up to order k included.
Conventionally, Ck(Ω) := Ck(Ω; R).
A function f : Ω →Rm is (of class) C∞, or smooth, if it is Ck for any k =
0, 1, . . ., so one deﬁnes
C∞(Ω; Rn) :=

k=0,1,...
Ck(Ω; Rn) .
Again, C∞(Ω) := C∞(Ω; R). Eventually, f : Ω →Rm is Cω or real-analytic
if it is C∞and it admits a Taylor expansion (in several real variables) at any point
p ∈Ω, on some ﬁnite open ball around p contained in Ω. Usually, when the order
k of differentiability is not mentioned explicitly it means that k = ∞.
Notation B.1 In this section upper indices denote coordinates of Rn and components
of (contravariant) vectors. Hence the standard coordinates on Rn will be denoted by
x1, . . . , xn, instead of x1, . . . , xn.

Smooth Manifolds, Product Manifolds, Smooth
Functions
The most general and powerful tool for describing the features of spacetime, the
three-dimensional physical space and the abstract space of physical systems in clas-
sical theories, is the notion of smooth manifold. In practice a smooth manifold is a
collection of objects, generally called points, that admits local coordinates identifying
points with n-tuples of Rn.

Appendix B: Elements of Differential Geometry
Deﬁnition B.2 Let n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . and k = 1, 2, . . . , ∞, ω be ﬁxed. A Ck man-
ifold of dimension n is a set M, whose elements are called points, equipped with
the geometric structure deﬁned below.
(1) M has a differentiable structure A = {(Ui, φi)}i∈I of class Ck, that is a
collection of pairs (Ui, φi), called local charts, where Ui is a subset in M and φi a
map Ui →Rn (the local coordinate system or local frame) such that:
(i) ∪i∈IUi = M, every mapping φi is injective and φi(Ui) ⊂Rn is open (so M is
called an n-dimensional manifold, or just n-manifold);
(ii) local charts in A must be pairwise Ck-compatible. Two injective maps φ :
U →Rn, ψ : V →Rn with U, V ⊂M are Ck-compatible if either U ∩V = ∅, or
U ∩V ̸= ∅and the maps φ ◦ψ−1 : ψ(U ∩V ) →φ(U ∩V ), ψ ◦φ−1 : φ(U ∩V ) →
ψ(U ∩V ) are both Ck;
(iii) A is maximal: if U ⊂M is open and φ : U →Rn is compatible with every
local chart of A , then (U, φ) ∈A .
(2) The topological requirements are:
(i) M is a second-countable Hausdorff space;
(ii) M is, by way of A , locally homeomorphic to Rn. In other terms, if (U, φ) ∈A
then U is open and φ : U →φ(U) is a homeomorphism.
A Cω manifold is more often called real-analytic manifold.
Remark B.3
(1) We include in the deﬁnition of manifold the case n = 0: R0 = {0} is the typical
0-dimensional manifold. Also N equipped with the topology induced by R is a 0-
dimensional manifold. Second-countability forces a 0-dimensional manifold to be a
ﬁnite or countable collection of discrete points, and the value of k becomes irrelevant.
(2) Every local chart (U, φ) enables us to assign n real numbers (x1
p, . . . , xn
p) = φ(p)
bijectively to every point p of U. The entries of the n-tuple are the coordinates of
p in the local chart (U, φ). Points in U are thus in one-to-one correspondence with
n-tuples of φ(U) ⊂Rn.
(3) If U ∩V ̸= ∅, the compatibility of local charts (U, φ), (V, ψ) implies that the
Jacobian matrix of φ◦ψ−1 is invertible and so has everywhere non-zero determinant.
Conversely, if φ ◦ψ−1 : ψ(U ∩V ) →φ(U ∩V ) is bijective, of class Ck, and with
non-vanishing Jacobian determinant on ψ(U ∩V ), then also ψ ◦φ−1 : φ(U ∩V ) →
ψ(U ∩V ) is Ck and the local charts are compatible. The proof can be found in the
renowned [CoFr98II].
Theorem B.4 (Implicit function theorem) Let D ⊂Rn be open, non-empty, and
f : D →Rn a Ck function, for some k = 1, 2, . . . , ∞. If the Jacobian of f at
p ∈D has non-zero determinant, there exist open neighbourhoods U ⊂D of p and
V of f (p) such that: (i) f ↾U: U →V is bijective, (ii) the inverse f ↾−1
U : V →U
is Ck.
(3) The topological requirements in (2)(i) (valid for the standard topology of Rn) are
technical and guarantee unique solutions to differential equations on M (necessary
in physics when the equations describe the evolution of physical systems) and the
existence of integrals on M. Condition (2)(ii) intuitively says that around any of its

Appendix B: Elements of Differential Geometry
921
points M is undistinguishable from a continuous image of Rn. Standard counterex-
amples show that the Hausdorff property of Rn is not carried over to M by local
homeomorphisms, so it must be imposed explicitly.
(4) Let M be a second-countable Hausdorff space. A collection of local charts A on
M satisfying (i) and (ii) in (1), but not necessarily (iii), plus (ii) in (2) is called a Ck
atlas on the n-manifold M. It is not hard to see that any atlas A on M is contained
in some maximal atlas. Two atlases on M such that every chart of one is compatible
with any chart of the other induce the same differentiable structure on M. Therefore
to assign a differentiable structure it sufﬁces to prescribe a non-maximal atlas, one of
the many that determine it. The unique differentiable structure associated to a given
atlas is said to be induced by the atlas.
(5) If 1 ≤k < ∞there might be superﬂuous charts in the differentiable structure
(only a ﬁnite number!); by eliminating them we obtain a C∞atlas.
■
Examples B.5
1. The simplest examples of differentiable manifolds, of class C∞and dimension
n, are non-empty open subsets of Rn (including Rn itself) with the standard differ-
entiable structure determined by the identity map (the inclusion, alone, deﬁnes an
atlas).
2. Consider the unit sphere S2 in R3 (with topology inherited from R3) centred at the
origin:
S2 :=

(x1, x2, x3) ∈R3  (x1)2 + (x2)2 + (x3)2 = 1

in canonical coordinates x1, x2, x3 of R3. It has dimension 2 and a smooth structure
induced by R3 by deﬁning an atlas with 6 local charts (S2
(i)±, φ(i)
± ) (i = 1, 2, 3) as
follows. Take the axis xi (i = 1, 2, 3) and the pair of open hemispheres S2
(i)± with
‘south-to-north’ direction given by xi, and consider local charts φ(i)
± : S2
(i)± →R2
that map p ∈S2
(i)± to its coordinates on the plane xi = 0. It can be proved (see
below) that S2 cannot be covered by a single (global) chart, in contrast to R3 (or any
open subspace). This shows that the class of smooth manifolds does not reduce to
open non-empty subsets of Rn, and hence is quite interesting. A similar example is
the unit circle in R2.
■
Given Ck manifolds M and N of respective dimensions m, n, we can construct a third
Ck manifold of dimension m +n over the topological product M × N. (The resulting
space will be Hausdorff and second-countable.) This is called product manifold of
M and N, and denoted simply by M × N. The structure described below is called
product structure. Given local charts (U, φ) on M and (V, ψ) on N it is immediate
to see
U × V ∋(p, q) →(φ(p), ψ(q)) =: φ ⊕ψ(p, q) ∈Rm+n
(B.1)
is a local homeomorphism. If (U ′, φ′) and (V ′, ψ′) are other charts, compatible with
the previous ones, the charts (U × V, φ ⊕ψ) and (U ′ × V ′, φ′ ⊕ψ′) are obviously
compatible. As (U, φ) and (V, ψ) vary on M and N the charts (U ×V, φ⊕ψ) deﬁne

922
Appendix B: Elements of Differential Geometry
an atlas on M × N. The structure this atlas generates is, by deﬁnition, the product
structure.
Deﬁnition B.6 Given Ck manifolds M, N of dimension m, n, the product manifold
is the set M × N equipped the with product topology and the Ck structure induced
by the local charts (U × V, φ ⊕ψ) in (B.1), when (U, φ), (V, ψ) vary on M, N.
Since a manifold is locally indistinguishable from Rn, the differentiable structure
allows to make sense of differentiable functions deﬁned on a manifold other than Rn
or subsets. The idea is simple: reduce locally to the standard notion on Rn using the
local charts that cover the manifold.
Deﬁnition B.7 Let M, N be manifolds of dimensions m, n and class C p, Cq re-
spectively (p, q ≥1). A continuous map f : M →N is said Ck (0 ≤k ≤p, q,
possibly k = ∞or ω) if ψ ◦f ◦φ−1 : Rm →Rn is a Ck map, for any choice of
local charts (U, φ) on N and (V, ψ) on M.
The collection of Ck functions from M to N, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , ∞, ω is denoted
by Ck(M; N); if N = R one just writes Ck(M).
A Ck diffeomorphism f : M →N is a bijective Ck map with Ck inverse.
If there is a Ck diffeomorphism f mapping M to N, the two manifolds are called
diffeomorphic (under f ).
Remark B.8
(1) Notice how we allowed for differentiable maps of class C0, which are simply
continuous maps (just as C0 diffeomorphisms are homeomorphisms). Every Ck dif-
feomorphism is clearly a homeomorphism, which explains why there cannot exist
any diffeomorphism between S2 and (a subset of) R2, for the former is compact, the
latter not. Consequently, the sphere S2 does not admit global charts.
(2) For f : M →N to be C p it is enough that ψ ◦f ◦φ−1 is C p for any local charts
(U, φ), (V, ψ) in the given atlases, without having to check the condition for every
possible local chart on the manifolds.
■
A useful notion is that of embedded submanifold. The space Rn is an embedded
submanifold in Rm if m > n. In the canonical coordinates x1, . . . , xm on Rm, Rn is
identiﬁed with the subspace given by equations xn+1 = · · · = xm = 0, while the ﬁrst
n coordinates of Rm, x1, . . . , xn, are identiﬁed with the standard coordinates on Rn.
Now the idea is to replace Rn, Rm using local frames, and generalise to manifolds
N, M.
Deﬁnition B.9 Let M be a Ck (k ≥1) manifold of dimension m > n. An embedded
Ck submanifold of M of dimension n is an n-manifold N of class Ck such that
(a) N is a subset in M with induced topology;
(b) the differentiable structure di N is given by the atlas {(Ui, φi)}i∈I where:
(i) Ui = Vi ∩N, φi = ψ↾Vi∩N for a suitable local chart (Vi, φi) on M;
(ii) in the frame x1, . . . , xm associated to (Vi, φi), the set Vi ∩N is determined
by xn+1 = · · · = xm = 0, and the remaining coordinates x1, . . . , xn are the local
frame associated to φi.

To ﬁnish we state an important result (see [doC92, Wes78] for example) to decide
whenasubsetinamanifoldisanembeddedsubmanifold.Theproofisstraightforward
from Dini’s theorem [CoFr98II].
Theorem B.10 (On regular values) Let M be a Ck manifold of dimension m. Con-
sider the set
N := {p ∈M | f j(p) = v j , j = 1, . . . , c}
determined by c(< m) constants v j and c functions f j : M →R of class Ck.
Suppose that around each point p ∈N there exists a local chart (U, φ) on M such
that the Jacobian matrix ∂( f j ◦φ−1)/∂xi|φ(p) ( j = 1, . . . , c, i = 1, . . . , m) has
rank r. Then N is an embedded Ck submanifold in M of dimension n := m −c.
In particular, if the square c × c matrix
∂f j ◦φ−1
∂xk
,
j = 1, . . . , c,
k = m −c + 1, m −c + 2, . . . , m
is non-singular at φ(p), p ∈N, then the ﬁrst n coordinates x1, . . . , xn deﬁne a
frame system around p in N.
B.2
Tangent and Cotangent Spaces. Covariant
and Contravariant Vector Fields
Let M be Ck manifold of dimension n (k ≥1). Consider the space Ck(M) as an
R-vector space under linear combinations
(af + bg)(p) := af (p) + bg(p) ,
for any p ∈M
where a, b ∈R, f, g ∈Ck(M). Given a point p ∈M, a derivation at p is an
R-linear map L p : Ck(M) →R satisfying the Leibniz rule:
L p( f g) = f (p)L p(g) + g(p)L p( f ) ,
f, g ∈Ck(M).
(B.2)
A linear combination aL p + bL′
p of derivations at p (a, b ∈R),
(aL p + bL′
p)( f ) := aL p( f ) + bL′
p( f ) ,
f, g ∈Ck(M),
is still a derivation. Hence derivations at p form a vector space over R, which we
denote Dk
p. Every local chart (U, φ) with U ∋p automatically gives n derivations at
p, as follows. If x1, . . . , xn are coordinates associated to φ, deﬁne the kth derivation

space of M at p and is written TpM. The elements of the tangent space at p are the
tangent vectors at p to M. Tangent vectors are examples of contravariant vectors.
We recall that the space V ∗of linear maps from a real vector space V to R is called
dual space to V . If the dimension of V is ﬁnite, so is the dimension of V ∗, for they
coincide. In particular, if {ei}i=1,...,n is a basis of V , the dual basis in V ∗is the basis
{e∗j} j=1,...,n deﬁned via e∗j(ei) = δ j
i , i, j = 1, . . . , n, by linearity. With f ∈V ∗,
v ∈V , one uses the notation ⟨v, f ⟩:= f (v).

point.
The dual space to TpM is called cotangent space of M at p, written T ∗
p M. Points

are instances of covariant vectors (covectors). For any basis

in any local chart (U, ψ).
Consider a Cr curve inside the Ck manifold M (r = 0, 1, . . . , k), i.e. a Cr function
γ : I →M where I ⊂R is an open interval thought of as a submanifold in R.
Assume explicitly that r > 1. We can deﬁne the tangent vector to γ at p ∈γ (I) by

So we have this deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition B.14 A Cr curve, r = 0, 1, . . . , k, in the n-dimensional Ck manifold M
is a Cr map γ : I →M, where I ⊂R is an open interval (embedded in R). When
r > 1, the tangent vector to γ at p = γ (tp), tp ∈I, is the vector ˙γ (p) ∈TpM

Pushforward and Pullback
Let M and N be manifolds of dimensions m and n, and f : N →M a function (all at
least C1). Given a point p ∈N consider local charts (U, φ) around p in N and (V, ψ)
around f (p) in M. Indicate by (y1, . . . , yn) the coordinates on U, by (x1, . . . , xm)
those on V and introduce maps f k(y1, . . . , yn) = xk( f ◦φ−1), k = 1, . . . , m. Now
deﬁne:
(i) the pushforward d f p : TpN →T f (p)M, in coordinates:

(ii) the pullback f ∗

It is not hard to see they do not depend on local frame systems. The pushforward is
also written f p∗: TpN →T f (p)M.
