Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant knowledge through their
outputs, though it is often unclear whether false outputs are due to a lack of knowl-
edge or dishonesty. In this paper, we investigate instructed dishonesty, wherein
we explicitly prompt LLaMA-2-70b-chat to lie. We perform prompt engineering
to find which prompts best induce lying behavior, and then use mechanistic inter-
pretability approaches to localize where in the network this behavior occurs. Using
linear probing and activation patching, we localize five layers that appear especially
important for lying. We then find just 46 attention heads within these layers that
enable us to causally intervene such that the lying model instead answers honestly.
We show that these interventions work robustly across many prompts and dataset
splits. Overall, our work contributes a greater understanding of dishonesty in LLMs
so that we may hope to prevent it.

Introduction
As large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing capability [Bubeck et al., 2023] and begun
to see widespread societal adoption, it has become more important to understand and encourage
honest behavior from them. Park et al. [2023] and Hendrycks et al. [2023] argue that the potential for
models to be deceptive (which they define as “the systematic inducement of false beliefs in the pursuit
of some outcome other than the truth”; Park et al. [2023]) carries novel risks, including scalable
misinformation, manipulation, fraud, election tampering, or the speculative risk of loss of control.
In such cases, the literature suggests that models may have the relevant knowledge encoded in their
activations, but nevertheless fail to produce the correct output because of misalignment [Burns et al.,
2022]. To clarify this distinction, Zou et al. [2023] delineates the difference between truthfulness and
honesty: a truthful model avoids asserting false statements while an honest model avoids asserting
statements it does not “believe.” A model may therefore produce false statements not because of a
lack of capability, but due to misalignment in the form of dishonesty [Lin et al., 2022].
Several works have since attempted to tackle LLM honesty by probing the internal state of a model
to extract honest representations [Burns et al., 2022, Azaria and Mitchell, 2023, Li et al., 2023,
Levinstein and Herrmann, 2023]. Recent black box methods have also been proposed for prompting
and detecting large language model lies [Pacchiardi et al., 2023]. Notably, Zou et al. [2023] shows
that prompting models to actively think about a concept can improve extraction of internal model
representations. Moreover, in a context-following environment, Halawi et al. [2023] finds that
there exists some “critical” intermediate layer in models, after which representations on true/false
answers in context-following seem to diverge–a phenomenon they refer to as “overthinking." Inspired

by Halawi et al. [2023], we expand the scope from mis-labeled in-context learning to instructed
dishonesty, wherein we explicitly instruct the model to lie.
In this setting, we aim to isolate and understand which layers and attention heads in the model are
responsible for dishonesty using probing and mechanistic interpretability approaches.
Our contributions are as follows:
1. We demonstrate that LLaMA-2-70b-chat can be instructed to lie, as measured by meaning-
fully below-chance accuracy on true/false questions. We find that this can be surprisingly
sensitive and requires careful prompt engineering.
2. We isolate five layers in the model that play a crucial role in dishonest behavior, finding
independent evidence from probing and activation patching.
3. We successfully perform causal interventions on just 46 attention heads (or 0.9% of all heads
in the network), causing lying models to instead answer honestly. These interventions work
robustly across many prompts and dataset splits.
2
Experimental Setup
Because we want to test dishonesty (or how the model ‘intends’ to answer, as opposed to whether
it knows the answer in the first place), we compile an easy true/false dataset by taking the Azaria
and Mitchell [2023] dataset and filtering for statements a smaller model would be most confident
about. We do this by running LLaMA-2-7b-chat on a given datapoint (when prompting it to answer
truthfully) and discarding it if it doesn’t answer correctly (namely, the “True” or “False” token) with
a probability > .85. We do this across all six splits of the dataset: “Cities", “Inventions", “Chemical
Elements", “Animals", “Companies", and “Scientific Facts."
Having compiled this dataset, we then use it to evaluate LLaMA-2-70b-chat along with various
system prompts that either encourage it to tell the truth or lie. We input the true/false statements in a
dialog context, wherein a user asks the model whether the statement is true or false. To determine the
model’s answer with a single token, we append a prefix to the model’s answer so that the next most
likely token is either “True” or “False”.
We consider a model to act honestly if its accuracy on these true/false questions is significantly
above random chance and dishonestly if its accuracy is significantly below random chance. We
consider such behavior dishonest because in order answer with dramatically below-chance accuracy,
the model must first accurately estimate the truth-value of the statement, but then actively negate it in
its response. We find that inducing lying behavior can be surprisingly difficult and requires careful
prompt engineering.
2.1
Probing
We train and test linear probes on the parallelized attention head activations (which we refer to as z
activations, of dimension 128). These are binary logistic classifiers trained on the model’s cached
activations over the dataset, with labels corresponding to the truth value of the prompt. More details
and definitions can be found in Appendix A.1.
2.2
Activation Patching
We also conduct activation patching, a technique from Meng et al. [2023] and Wang et al. [2022], on
z activations. In activation patching, an intermediate activation is “patched” to have a different value
(given by a different input) than it otherwise would have, affecting all future layers and the output of
the model. This enables us to see the counterfactual effect of any given architectural component. In
our setting, we store activations from the honest model’s forward pass and edit them into the lying
model’s forward pass.

Results
3.1
Prompting for Dishonest Behavior
We find engineer prompts that successfully cause LLaMA-2-70b-chat to tell the truth and lie. Our
prompts are illustrated in Table 1. Full prompts consist of 1) a system prompt, 2) a user prompt
asking about the truthfulness of a statement, and 3) a prefix. We also report testing accuracy (recall)
on both true and false statements, as opposed to a uniform accuracy metric, to ensure we can check if
the model’s output tends to be imbalanced. We measure performance by comparing the next token
probability for “True” and “False”.
LLaMA-2-70b-chat is capable of lying, though it can be difficult to cause the model to output the
incorrect answer on the token level. For example, the model appears to have a strong unbalanced bias
toward outputting “False” instead of “True” on the token level on prompts inducing lying behavior,
as seen in prompts 2-6 for "no prefix" in Figure 1 where accuracy on false statements is high and
accuracy on true statements is low (in an ideal lying case, accuracy on all statements would be
low). Empirically, we find that this is because when prompted to lie, the model tends to output filler
tokens before “True” more often than for “False” (e.g. when model told to lie on a false statement, it
generates “That’s simple! Of course the statement is true...”; for a true statement, it generates “False!
...”).
3

Figure 1: Model recall tested across different system prompts and splits of the Azaria and
Mitchell [2023] dataset, separated by prompts that contained and did not contain a pre-written
prefix in the model response. Recall is measured on both true (recall_pos) and false (recall_neg)
statements. The prefixes tend to result in much better prompted lying performance, while non-prefix
lying prompts tend to heavily bias toward “False” over “True” on the next token. The “Unexpected”
column indicates if both True and False tokens are too low, and is measured as a percentage of all
splits of the dataset. Details on exact prompts can be found in Table 1. Results on 200 randomly
selected samples in the test set of each split.
We overcome these issues by adding assistant response prefixes that reduce the observed biases.
For example, we may start the assistant’s answer with “Oh that’s an easy one! The statement is
definitely...”, which significantly improves the rate at which the model consistently outputs the
incorrect answer when prompted to lie.
We demonstrate these prompt engineering subtleties in Figure 1. In each row, we evaluate a different
combination of system prompt, user prompt, and prefix as defined in Table 1. Overall, our honest
prompts can achieve accuracies upwards of 95% correct (high accuracy indicates excellent honest
4

prompt performance), while our best liar prompts often get less than 5% correct (low accuracy
indicates excellent lying prompt performance). Furthermore, the best lying prompts consistently and
reliably negate the truth, as indicated by both positive and negative recall both being close to zero
(few true positives or true negatives) – as opposed to failing to estimate truth properly, being confused
and answering questions ambiguously, or being biased towards a certain token. By contrast, on all
splits, random chance hovers around 50%. It’s worth noting that it is much more difficult to instruct
smaller models to output incorrect answers and act dishonestly. The prompts we use tend to perform
poorly on LLaMA-2-7b-chat and LLaMA-2-13b-chat.
For our experiments below, we indicate which prompts were used via the indexing scheme outlined in
Table 1. For example, prompt 2aii refers to system prompt “Lying 2”, user prompt “a”, and prefix “ii”.
System prompt 1 (Honest) is simply the standard LLaMA-2 system prompt as outlined in Touvron
et al. [2023].
3.2
Honest-Liar Probe Transfer
We test the in-distribution and out-of-distribution transfer accuracy of all z activation probes at the
last sequence position, across honest and liar system prompts. We also compare cosine similarities
between probe coefficients as a proxy for similarities in representation.
Figure 2a shows probes trained on one of the prompts (honest top row and liar bottom row) and tested
on one of the prompts (honest left column and liar right column). The diagonal demonstrates the
in-distribution accuracy of the probes, and the off-diagonal demonstrates transfer accuracy. Figure
2b similarly shows the cosine similarities between probe coefficients between the honest and lying
prompts.
We find that both transfer probe accuracies and cosine similarities between honest and liar system
prompts diverge at some intermediate layer; in the early-middle layers, a not-insignificant number of
probes transfer with very high accuracy (reaching 90% chance) and discovered probe coefficients
have very high cosine similarity. However, after an intermediate layer (around layer 23), many of
the probes seem to reach very low (down to 10%) accuracy when transferred and the honest vs. liar
probe coefficients become anti-parallel.
The Honest-Liar transfer suggests there are parallel representations before layer 23 and anti-parallel
representations thereafter. This could be explained by the dishonest model first estimating the
truth-value of the statement and then negating this representation around layers 19-23.
This “flip” in representation may be a result of the model’s manipulation of the truth value at the last
sequence position. This result mirrors the “overthinking” phenomenon found in Halawi et al. [2023].
Although they consider models who repeat mis-labeled data in a few-shot learning setting, one could
see analogies between a model that has been implicitly instructed to repeat incorrect labels and a
model that has been explicitly instructed to lie.
3.3
Activation Patching
3.3.1
Layer-wise Patching
To further investigate this phenomenon, we patch in z activations from the honest model to the lying
model to see if we can flip its predictions so that it instead answers honestly. We first test patching in
groups of 5 contiguous attention layers on the last 25 sequence positions, finding that patching layers
19 through 23 is sufficient to get the lying model (whose base accuracy is 2%) to give the correct
answer at a rate of 63% (shown in Figure 3). We also do patching for one to four contiguous layers,
which can be found in Appendix B.3, where we again see the importance of layers 19-23.
3.3.2
Head-Level Patching
We next look to localize our activation patching further by finding a small set of attention heads
that suffice to get the lying model to answer truthfully. After finding that layers 19-23 are the most
important for lying, we decide to patch those five layers (from the honest to lying model) and find
the most important heads within them. We do this by iterating through all attention heads in layers
19-23 and measure which heads’ absence, i.e. lack of patching, causes the biggest drop in the patched
5

Figure 2: (a) Probe transfer accuracy and (b) probe coefficient cosine similarities between the
honest and liar system prompted activations, across all layers (rows) and heads (columns) in
LLaMA-2-70b-chat, using a filtered version of Azaria & Mitchell’s Scientific Facts dataset split.
Evaluated at the last sequence position.
Figure 3: Activation patching from honest to liar on the last 25 sequence positions. All patches
conducted 5 layers at a time (x refers to start of 5-layer range). We see that layers 19-23 are sufficient
to bring the dishonest model’s accuracy to 63%.
model’s accuracy. We patch the last 25 sequence positions, though the experimental setup can be
replicated for any arbitrary number of sequence positions.
We run this exhaustive search over 50 samples from the Scientific Facts dataset split and on a baseline
honest and liar prompt (starred in Table 2) and show our results in Figure 4. In particular, we see that
the vast majority of heads in these layers have absolutely no effect on the model’s accuracy on these
50 data points. On the other hand, there are 46 heads which do lower the patched model’s accuracy
when removed. Hence, we decide to perform activation patching with these 46 heads across 5 layers
(which make up 0.9% of all heads in the network).
When we patch these 46 heads on the full Scientific Facts dataset split, we find that the patched
model’s accuracy improves (from 64% to 83%) over when we patched all heads across layers 19-
23. We suspect this might have to do with the presence of inhibitory heads (which when removed
individually increase model accuracy as shown in Figure 4). Alternatively, it could be that too much
blind patching results in a lower signal-to-noise ratio, motivating the need to test how well the selected
heads generalize to other prompts and datasets.
6

Figure 4: Only a small subset of heads in layers 19-23 have any effect on accuracy. We patch all
but one attention head in layers 19-23, iterating through the heads that we leave out. When we run
this search process, only 46 heads have any impact on the patched model’s accuracy, suggesting that
these are the heads that matter for lying.
3.3.3
Out-of-Distribution Generalization
Given the same heads that were selected based on 50 samples from the Scientific Facts dataset split
and on one prompt, we evaluate how robust their effect is across four varying prompts and on all six
topic splits of the filtered Azaria and Mitchell [2023] dataset in Table 2. We test a limited set of
prompts and patch the last 25 sequence positions; a table with results for many more prompts can be
found in Appendix B.4, and comparisons of patching performance across more sequence positions
can be found in Appendix B.5. The prompts we use to test generalization can be found in Table 1.
Remarkably, we find strong generalization across both prompts and datasets (in spite of the few data
points and single prompt used in selecting the 46 heads). In majority of prompt-dataset combinations,
the “Patched Liar” – which was instructed to lie but patched with selected honest-prompted model
head outputs – significantly recovers honest-prompted performance (>50% accuracy). We further
find that one can patch both ways, as shown by the “Patched Honest” model – which was instructed
to be honest but patched with selected liar-prompted model head outputs – nearing liar-prompted
performance (<50% accuracy).
In some cases, the patching also transfers remarkably well. For prompt 6fiii, the patching works
very strongly, despite prompt 2fii being used to select the heads. In fact, on the Chemical Elements
dataset split, the “Patched Liar” model actually gets higher accuracy than the honest model. On two
other splits, the “Patched Liar” matches the honest model exactly, getting upwards of 98% accuracy.
However, there exist some dataset/prompt combinations out of distribution that patching heads does
not generalize as well on. On many of these combinations, both the honest and liar models tend to
perform worse (without patching) at getting high and low accuracy respectively, which the model’s
performance might be inherently challenged in those particular contexts.

Conclusions and Future Work
We investigate a basic scenario of lying, in which we instruct an LLM to either be honest or lie
about the truthfulness of a statement. Building on previous results that indicate activation probing
can generalize out-of-distribution when prompted, our findings show that large models can exhibit
dishonest behavior, in which they output correct answers if prompted to be honest and incorrect
answers if prompted to lie. Nevertheless, we find this can require extensive prompt engineering given
issues such as the model’s propensity to output the “False” token earlier in the sequence than the
“True” token. We obtain consistent prompted lying through prefix injection, and we then compare the
activations of honest and dishonest models, localizing layers and attention heads implicated in lying.
We explore this lying behavior using linear probes and find that model representations between
honest and liar prompts are quite similar in early-to-middle layers and then diverge sharply, becoming
anti-parallel. This may provide evidence that a context-invariant representation of truth, as sought
after by a collection of literature [Burns et al., 2022], ought to be found in earlier layers.
Furthermore, we use activation patching to learn more about the mechanisms of individual layers
and heads. Indeed, we find localized interventions that can fully correct the misalignment between
the liar and honest-prompted models in either direction. Importantly, these interventions on just 46
attention heads show a reasonably strong level of robustness across datasets and prompts.

While previous work has mostly focused on the truthfulness and accuracy of models that are honest
by default, we zone in on lying by using an easy dataset and explicitly instructing the model to lie.
This setting has offered us valuable insights into the intricacies of prompting for dishonesty and the
mechanisms by large models perform dishonest behavior. We hope that future work in this setting
may give rise to further ways to prevent LLM lying to ensure the safe and honest use of LLMs in the
real world.
Future Work
Our analysis is in a toy scenario—realistic lying scenarios will not simply involve the model outputting
a one-token incorrect response, but could involve arbitrarily misaligned optimization targets such as
swaying the reader’s political beliefs [Park et al., 2023] or selling a product [Pacchiardi et al., 2023].
Future research may use methods similar to those presented here to find where biases/misalignments
exist in the model and how more complex misalignments steer LLM outputs away from the truth.
Furthermore, much more work should be done on analyzing the mechanisms by which the model
elicits a truth-value representation and then on how the model uses this representation along with
the system prompt to decide whether or not to respond truthfully. The observed representation flip
could be a “truth” bit, “intent” bit, or could be related to more general behavior such as answer
tokens or some inscrutable abstraction. Further mechanistic interpretability work testing the various
truthfulness representations and heads discovered would enable stronger, more precise claims about
how lying behavior works.

Model Activations (extended)
We utilize an autoregressive language model with a transformer architecture. We follow the multi-
head attention (MHA) representation set in Gurnee et al. [2023] and Li et al. [2023]. Given an input
sequence of tokens X of length n, the model M : X →Y outputs a probability distribution over the
token vocabulary V to predict the next token in the sequence.
This prediction mechanism involves the transformation of each token into a high-dimensional space
dmodel. In this paradigm, intermediate layers in M consist of multi-head attention (MHA) followed
by a position-wise multi-layer perception (MLP) operation, which reads from the residual stream xi
and then writes its output by adding it to the residual stream to form xi+1.
In MHA, the model computes multiple sets of Q, K, and V matrices to capture different relations
within the input data. Each set yields its own self-attention output z. The specific attention head
output z for any given head corresponds to the matrix of size dhead prior to undergoing a linear
projection that yields the final self-attention output for the mentioned head. It can be conceptualized
as a representation that captures specific relational nuances between input sequences, which might
be different for each attention head. For this reason, while the MHA process is typically done
with multiple sets of weight matrices with the results concatenated and linearly transformed, we
train probes on the individual output activations z of each attention head, which has dimension
dmodel/nheads = 8192/64 = 128.
It’s important to note that while LLaMA-2-70b-chat utilizes a variant of the multi-head attention
mechanism known as grouped-query attention (GQA), the fundamental principle remains similar to
MHA. In GQA, key and value matrices are shared among groups of attention heads, as opposed to
each head having its own distinct key and value matrices in standard MHA. This variation slightly
alters the way attention is computed in intermediate steps, but does not significantly change the
validity of methods that train probes on or activation patch the attention head output z.

Logit Attribution
We examine the logit attributions of the honest and the liar models, which is a technique for demon-
strating how much each layer’s attention directly contributes to the logit difference between the
correct and incorrect logit ("True" - "False" or "False" - "True") by unembedding the attention output
of every layer to the residual stream [Wang et al., 2022]. The main conclusion we can draw from this
logit attribution is that layers before 40 do no or very little logit attribution, 40-45 start to do some,
and 45-75 do the bulk of the logit attribution.
This seems to provide further evidence that the best truthful representations and lying preprocessing
would not be found in the later layers, as the later layers merely seem to “write the model’s output”
and contain information about the model’s response rather than the truth. Instead, the best truthful
representations and the mechanisms for processing system prompts in order to lie are more likely to
be found before most of the logit attribution is done, before layer 40.
B.2
Concept Erasure
Belrose et al. [2023] introduces a technique called concept scrubbing, specifically applied to inter-
mediate activations in models. This method, known as LEACE (Least-Squares Concept Erasure),
is designed to selectly remove specific types of information – in this case, linear truth information –
from each layer of a model while perturbing the activations as little as possible. This permits us to
analyze which truth representations the model actually makes use of. If concept scrubbing a particular
set of layers causes the model to become much less accurate, it is likely that the model was relying
on the linear truth information in those layers.
10

Figure 5: Logit attributions of each layer’s attention output towards the difference in correct
minus incorrect token logits.
Given a concept defined by a classification dataset (X ∈Rn×d, y ∈{0, ..., k}n), LEACE can
transform X such that no linear classifier can attain better than trivial accuracy at predicting the
concept label from the transformed data (applying an affine transformation to each example depending
on its class yi).
We specifically use Oracle LEAst-squares Concept Erasure, a variant of LEACE that uses test labels
at inference time, to scrub as much linear truthful information as possible. However, due to varying
lengths and information content in true/false statements, we choose to only apply O-LEACE to
the last 15 sequence positions. Thus, not all linear truth information is erased across all sequence
positions.
We run O-LEACE on both honest and lying models, attempting to erase the concept of truthfulness
from each. As Figure 6 demonstrates, only a small number of layer range concept-erasures produce
any noticeable change in model accuracy. Testing the erasure of five layers at a time, we find that
task performance is most affected by O-LEACE on layers 19-23 (as well as 25-29), indicating a key
role in processing truth-related information.
Figure 6: Accuracy after LEACE, patching on the last 15 sequence positions, showing the honest
and liar model’s accuracy post-LEACE. All patches conducted 5 layers at a time to magnify effect
(x refers to start of 5-layer range). Tested on the filtered Scientific Facts dataset split.
B.3
Layer-wise Activation Patching
We show results for when we patch k layers on the Scientific Facts dataset split. For point i on the
x-axis, we patch layers i through i + k. From left to right, we have k range from 1 to 5. In all cases,
11

layer 19 seems especially prominent.
Figure 7: Patching ranges of k attention layers from honest to liar. Patching multiple layers
at once predictably produces a larger effect, but there are clear effects for some individual layers.
Layer-wise patching does not seem as effective as patching the individual attention heads within
these layers.
B.4
More Activation Patching Generalization Results for Patched Liar Model
The generalization of the activation patching technique was further assessed by testing its efficacy
across many different prompts and datasets. This analysis was crucial to determine the robustness of
the identified 46 attention heads in influencing the model’s response towards honesty, irrespective of
the initial prompt or the context of the dataset. Table 3 and Table 4 present extended results of this
evaluation, showcasing how the patched model performed across different dataset splits and prompts.
The tables display the performance of the honest model, the liar model, and the patched liar model
under various prompts. Each row corresponds to a specific combination of prompt and dataset.
The performance is measured in terms of accuracy - the percentage of responses that were correct
for the given dataset and prompt. These results provide a comprehensive view of how well the
patching technique generalizes across different contexts and how effective it is in aligning the model’s
responses with honesty.
These findings indicate that the patching of selected attention heads significantly improves the
accuracy of the model’s responses in most cases, even when tested on prompts and datasets that were
not part of the initial selection process for these heads.
B.5
Activation patching across sequence positions
The effectiveness of activation patching was also evaluated across different sequence positions to
understand its impact better. The performance was assessed by patching the heads at varying distances
from the end of the sequence, specifically testing at the last 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, and 1 sequence
positions. The results, as summarized in Table 5, hint at how the model may process information
across different stages of its sequence generation. For example, we found that patching the last 10
versus the last 5 sequence positions seems to make no difference in prediction accuracy, indicating
that 46 heads identified may not conduct computation relevant to the prediction between sequence
positions -10 and -5.
As expected, patching at earlier sequence positions (i.e. last 30, 25, 20 sequence positions) resulted
in higher accuracy. Large drops in accuracy indicate regions that are likely involved in the initial
stages of truth evaluation or processing the prompt’s instruction for honesty/lying; this seems to occur
between sequence position ranges [-15, -10] as well as [-5, -1].
