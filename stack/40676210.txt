 tant systems. With present-day antennae of relatively small size,
 such measurements will allow us to determine the spectrum of the
 continuum and perhaps to obtain a rough idea of the distribution
 of radio brightness across a galaxy. Larger antennae of the future
 will no doubt be capable of resolving some of the finer detail in
 the nearer systems such as M 31 and NGC5128.
 More striking than the work on normal galaxies is the dis-
 covery of a number of very abnormal cases such as the colliding
 pair Cygnus A. In the optical range, two galaxies in collision
 excite very little attention, except for possible distortions in the
 shape of the spiral arms ; there is no interaction between indi-
 vidual stars of the two systems, and the emission from the col-
 liding gas masses adds little to the total light. The radio emission,
 on the other hand, can be as much as 108 times the normal radio
 radiation from the two systems in the absence of collision. In these
 freak cases there must exist very efficient mechanisms for the
 conversion of kinetic energy to radio-frequency energy. Because
 of the great distance at which such objects can be detected, they
 offer interesting possibilities for cosmological investigation and
 speculation.
 THE GALAXY
 The discovery of radio emission from our own galaxy
 Jansky in 193 11 is generally accepted to mark the birt
 astronomy. Jansky's investigations, which were a by
 work on transatlantic communications, established that 
 was a source of radio emission at the long meter wavele
 that the most intense emission was observed from t
 mate direction of the galactic center. His initial dis
 tracted little attention and was not investigated further
 years. The first serious surveys of the distribution of ra
 ness over the celestial sphere were made by Reber an
 Parsons, and Phillips in the northern hemisphere2'3 and
 and Westfold in the southern hemisphere.4 These inv
 were made using antennae of low resolving power and t
 of the fine detail was lost owing to instrumental bl

 emission from extragalactic nebulae. When observations with
 high-resolution antennae at the centimeter wavelengths became
 available, it was clear that the brightness concentration to the
 galactic plane was much greater than that shown by the meter-
 wavelength investigations. At the time, however, this did not
 give rise to undue concern, for a different origin of the radiation
 at widely differing wavelengths was quite acceptable. While the
 centimeter radiation could be explained in terms of thermal radia-
 tion from emission regions surrounding hot stars, and thus might
 reasonably be expected to follow a Population I distribution, the
 observed high intensities of the meter-wavelength radiation pre-
 cluded assuming an appreciable contribution from this mechanism.
 The first suggestion that the meter-wavelength results, even
 when "corrected" for the effects of the antenna beam, were in fact
 very poor approximations to the truth was made by Hanbury
 Brown and Hazard from a theoretical study of both meter- and
 centimeter-wavelength surveys.5 Experimental confirmation of
 their predictions in the meter-wavelength range was obtained by
 the interferometer observations of Scheuer and Ryle6 and Bolton.7
 These observers showed that there was a narrow band of intense
 emission within one or two degrees of the galactic plane. This
 was principally within 90° of longitude about the galactic center
 and there was some fine structure in longitude. More accurate and
 detailed observations have since been made by McGee, Slee, and
 Stanley at a wavelength of 75 centimeters8 and by Mills at four
 meters9 using pencil-beam antennae (see Figure 1). As a result,
 the position at the present time is that there are probably two
 distinct distributions, one which, in the absence of greater detail,

 lation I stars, and the other that is popularly referred to as the
 "halo." Even if some allowance is made for an extragalactic con-
 tribution, the flattening of the halo is certainly relatively small.
 The brightness of the halo, although fairly weak in contrast to the
 intense regions near the galactic plane, is such that it would con-
 tribute the major part of the integrated radiation from the Galaxy
 observed from an external point.
 There is also evidence for halo radiation from M 31, both in
 the work by Hanbury Brown and Hazard using a pencil-beam
 antenna10 and in interferometer measurements by Baldwin.11
 More extensive and brighter halos may also exist in NGC 5128
 and NGC 1316, which are unusual in having abnormally large

 The observation of the halo radiation from our own galaxy and
 the determination of its radio frequency spectrum present one
 of the most difficult technical problems in radio astronomy. It
 can only be carried out satisfactorily with large steerable re-
 flectors and will no doubt form an important part of the program
 of those under construction at present, which include a 250'
 reflector at Manchester, England, and an 84' reflector at the
 Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. Also projected
 are a 140' reflector in West Virginia, two 90' reflectors at the
 California Institute of Technology, and a reflector of the order
 of 200' in Australia.
 OTHER NORMAL GALAXIES
 Radiation in the meter-wavelength range has be
 from a number of other normal galaxies. For the
 Nebula and the two Magellanic Clouds, the resolving p
 radio telescopes is sufficient to obtain rough brightne
 tions. Thus Mills has been able to show that the r
 ness of the Large Magellanic Cloud roughly follow
 brightness of the 21 -centimeter line radiation and th
 of the bright stars.9 Results on M 31 indicate isop
 central region comparable to the optical isophotes and
 existence of a "halo."
 All other systems are too small to investigate in detail and
 only the integrated brightnesses can be measured. Such observa-
 tions have been made by Hanbury Brown and Hazard in the
 northern hemisphere13 and by Mills in the southern hemisphere.9
 Hanbury Brown adopted a radio magnitude scale such that the
 radio magnitude of a normal (in his case actually Sb or Sc)
 galaxy at 160 Mc/s is approximately the same as the photo-

 where 5 is the flux density in watts per square meter per cycle-

 servations at other wavelengths have to be corrected by a "radio
 color index" for purposes of comparison. Although Hanbury
 Brown's system has not been ratified by any international scien-
 tific union, it has been adopted unanimously by other workers and
 is likely to persist.

 radiation in our own galaxy and in M 3 1 has recently been dis-
 cussed by G. R. Burbidge.16
 ABNORMAL GALAXIES
 A considerable number of the bright "radio stars" ha
 found to be abnormal galaxies ; in fact, two of the first t
 cessful identifications were such cases. One of these, N

 to optical emission for normal systems, the radio em

 northern hemisphere ; it is hoped that astronomers in the
 hemisphere will investigate the distance and magnitud
 system.
 The second object is M 87, one of the largest ellipticals. In
 addition to abnormal radio emission, this galaxy has two curious
 features ; one is a large number of clusters at the periphery and
 the other is a jet extending radially from the nucleus. This jet
 is actually made up of five or more condensations and has a very
 blue continuous spectrum. Recently, Baade has found strong
 polarization of the light of the jet, the direction changing between
 the condensations.18 There seems little doubt that for this object,
 as for the Crab Nebula, the synchrotron process is responsible for
 the unusual optical and radio emission.
 Still more extreme in the ratio of radio to optical radiation is
 that of the collision case, Cygnus A. The identification of this

 emission is believed to be associated with the interaction of the
 gas of the two colliding systems, although the process of the con-
 version from kinetic to radio energy is unknown. However, it
 must be extremely efficient ; the total energy in the observable
 radio spectrum exceeds that in the form of light, a great deal of
 which is concentrated in the emission lines (see Plate I). The
 available kinetic energy from the collision is being dissipated
 almost as fast as it becomes available, and thus the radio source
 cannot be expected to exist much longer than the time taken for
 the collision, which is of the order of 107 years.
 There is one other well-substantiated collision case, a partial
 collision of two systems in the Perseus cluster of galaxies. This
 object, NGC 1275, although a strong radio emitter, has a ratio
 of radio to light emission smaller than that of Cygnus A by about
 4 X 103.
 Two other radio stars, Hydra A and Hercules A, correspond
 very closely in position with pairs of faint galaxies and their
 identifications as such are considered almost certain, although the
 appearance of the individual galaxies on direct photographs sug-
 gests only weak interactions. From the radio and optical magni-
 tudes these would fit between NGC 1275 and Cygnus A in rela-
 tive strength of radio emission. Minkowski (private communica-
 tion) considers that two further identifications are almost cer-
 tain. There is very good agreement in position between two radio
 stars of the recent Cambridge survey and two galaxies in a list
 by Haro.22 These galaxies are classified as peculiar SO's and are

 extremely blue; they show strong nuclear emission lines, par-
 ticularly À 3727, but these lines are not alone responsible for the
 extreme color.
 The Cygnus A source is the intrinsically brightest radio object
 known. If it were ten times farther away it would still be among
 the first hundred brightest radio stars with an apparent photo-
 graphic magnitude of -f-23. One hundred times farther away
 would not put it beyond the reach of present radio telescopes, yet
 it would be inaccessible to the largest optical telescope. At ten
 times its distance the red shift would be half the velocity of light
 and the spectrum of a normal galaxy at this distance could hardly
 be obtained. However, because of the strength of the emission
 lines it might still be possible to obtain a spectrum of a Cygnus A
 case. Thus Cygnus A-type systems may very well present the
 astronomer with a means of extending the red-shift measure-
 ments for selected objects. To secure an identification of this
 type, however, the radio position measurements must be ex-
 tremely accurate, i.e., well within one square minute of arc, and
 preferably much better.
 This presents an extremely difficult observational problem.
 Smith and Mills were able to obtain accuracy of this order in the
 case of Cygnus A, but it is the second brightest radio star in the
 sky. For fainter objects, the position finding becomes more dif-
 ficult owing to the proximity of other radio stars of comparable
 brightness. The effects of such confusion, as it is called, are diffi-
 cult to overcome. The only possible method is interferometry, but
 experience has shown that with an interferometer it is possible to
 obtain a very accurate apparent position (or in some cases a series
 of alternate accurate positions) of an object which does not in
 fact exist at all. The location determined is the centroid, as seen
 by the particular instrument, of a number of other objects - for
 such a situation Minkowski has used the word "blends." The
 accuracy required demands both the use of interference systems
 and the use of primary antennae of sufficiently narrow beam
 width to avoid the possibility of confusion. A further source of
 error to be overcome in position finding is the effect of both
 large- and small-scale irregularities in the earth's ionosphere.
 Experience at wavelengths of three meters has shown that even

 near the zenith small-scale irregularities in 
 cause short-period changes in the apparent 
 star with a root-mean-square value of the order
 of arc. A serious effort to overcome some of these difficulties
 forms part of the program at the California Institute of Tech-
 nology where an interferometer consisting of two 90' reflectors
 is to be constructed.* At the short wavelengths where the equip-
 ment will be used, the primary beams of the individual antennae
 will be about Io and ionospheric effects should be considerably
 reduced.

 plane for bright sources was found by Hanbury Brown 
 Hazard from observations over a limited region of the galac
 plane.13 Similar results were also obtained by Bolton, Stanl

 galactic center. Away from the galactic plane they did not g

 A similar result was also obtained by Kraus from a survey 
 207 radio stars.26
 Last year the results of a survey with the large Cambridge
 interferometer became available. The catalogue compiled by Ryle
 and his associates includes 1936 objects, nearly twenty times
 more than any previous survey.27 The results were subjected to
 a statistical analysis by Ryle and Scheuer, who again found an
 excess of faint stars, the excess increasing up to the limit of their
 survey28 (see Figure 3). This excess was slightly reduced in a
 narrow belt near the galactic plane, but otherwise was shown to
 be constant in five equal independent sections of the balance of
 the celestial sphere. Ryle and Scheuer advanced arguments to
 show that this result was not caused by failure to detect some of
 the brighter radio stars because of their probable larger angular
 diameters or other instrumental selection effects. Even if the radio
 stars were made up of a number of widely differing classes, their
 result indicated that there must be an increasing spatial density
 with distance for at least one class. If they identified Cygnus A
 as the prototype of this class, their result meant that the density
 of colliding galaxies was more frequent in the distant past, and
 thus supported an evolutionary expanding universe rather than
 a steady-state cosmology.
 At the Jodrell Bank Symposium on Radio Astronomy in
 August 1955, it was brought out that the preliminary results of
 a survey with the Mills Cross in Sydney appeared to be in con-
 flict with the Cambridge result of a large excess of faint stars.
 The Australian results showed no abnormality over the range of
 flux densities of the Cambridge survey, but an excess was found
 for lower values of 5" near the sensitivity limit of this survey.

 This discrepancy has not yet been resolved. It has been pointed
 out by the writer that an excess ,of faint stars is the logical result
 of a survey where confusion exists or where the signal-to-noise
 ratio becomes small.29 The result of either of these difficulties is
 to introduce errors into the measurement of flux density that
 increase with increasing faintness of the star. This has the same
 result as an increase in the dispersion of the intrinsic star bright-

 of faint stars. No doubt it will be some time before the situation
 is clarified. If the excess of faint stars remains, as it well may
 after removal of the present experimental uncertainties, the cos-

 RADIO OBSERVATIONS AND THE RED SHIFT
 Early this year, Lilley and McClain made one

 tenacity in observation. The line was found by 
 ratio between the flux densities of Cygnus A an
 over a wide range of frequencies. About forty ob
 made at each of twelve different frequencies. Ab
 variation in the ratio established the existence of the line.
 As can be seen in Figure 4, the line breadth corresponds to
 a velocity spread of about 1000 km/sec, and its center corre-
 sponds to a red shift of 17,000 km /sec. This is in very good
 agreement with the value of 16,830 km/sec obtained by Baade and
 Minkowski from measurements in the optical spectrum. The
 observation is remarkable for two reasons, first because of the
 agreement between the red shifts at the two vastly different wave-
 lengths and second because of the strength of the absorption line.
 The agreement between the radio and optical red shift is very
 close. No doubt it could be improved by more accurate measure-
 ments, but there is no reason to suppose that the two results
 should agree exactly, as different parts of the gas masses are
 responsible for the optical emission lines and the radio absorption
 line.
 Minkowski and Wilson have examined the radio and optical
 data for the Cygnus A collision ; they find that the relative change
 in the red shift with wavelength for the lines in the optical spec-
 trum alone is less than 3 X 10"4 per 1000 Ä.31 However, com-
 bination of the optical and radio results shows that the relative
 change is less than 3 X 10'9 per 1000 Ä. Thus the fairly crude
 radio measurements combined with the optical measurements

 of emission about 45" X 20" in size separated by T26".32 It
 would be reasonable to assume that the hydrogen covers the radio
 emission sources alone ; an envelope of the order of Y 20" diame-
 ter would put the radius at 20 kiloparsecs and A, the surface area,
 at 5 X 103 kiloparsecs. This makes the total mass of the hydrogen
 in the envelope 8 X 1010 m®. It is, of course, possible that the
 spatial distribution of the source of the continuum radiation at
 a wavelength of 21 centimeters is entirely different from that at
 160 Mc/s ; any reduction would demand less hydrogen in the
 envelope. However, this must await further investigation.
 Recently Heeschen at Harvard has reported the observation
 of 21 -centimeter hydrogen emission from the Coma cluster of
 galaxies. With the introduction of larger reflectors, this type of
 observation will no doubt be extended to more distant clusters.
 Although the measurement of the red shift will not have the same
 importance as in the Cygnus A case, such observations will be of
 great value in determining the mass and spatial extent of atomic
 hydrogen in clusters.
