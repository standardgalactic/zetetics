This series is devoted to the universal approach to logic and the development of a general
theory of logics. It covers topics such as global set-ups for fundamental theorems of logic
and frameworks for the study of logics, in particular logical matrices, Kripke structures,
combination of logics, categorical logic, abstract proof theory, consequence operators, and
algebraic logic. It includes also books with historical and philosophical discussions about
the nature and scope of logic. Three types of books will appear in the series: graduate
textbooks, research monographs, and volumes with contributed papers.

Foreword
The project of an arithmetical logic has been in the making for many years and the present
work is the continuation of my 2002 book Internal Logic. Foundations of Mathematics
from Kronecker to Hilbert (Kluwer, Dordrecht). In the intervening years, I have pursued
the programme and I have published many scientiﬁc papers and a book in French on
the subject. The progress made towards an arithmetical logic is here recorded, but the
idea of an internal logic of arithmetic has not been altered. It is still the inner structure
of classical arithmetic or number theory, which is the objective of the foundational
enterprise. I have baptized that arithmetic the Fermat-Kronecker(FK) arithmetic and I have
constantly opposed it to Peano arithmetic. What I have been trying to show is that there
is no set-theoretic element in pure arithmetic, while Peano or Dedekind-Peano formalized
arithmetic is embedded in a transﬁnite set-theoretic framework. Kronecker’s ﬁnitist stand
in mathematics extends from Hilbert to contemporary constructive mathematics, e.g.
Bishop’s constructive analysis and Nelson’s predicative arithmetic. Gödel’s ‹extended
ﬁnitism› of the Dialectica Interpretation could be counted as a mitigated reappropriation
of Kronecker’s radical constructivism via Hilbert’s introduction of functionals inherited
from Kronecker’s higher-order forms (polynomials). This is one of the main themes I have
proposed in the recent years.
The central thesis of this book has been expanded to cover the constructivist insights
in physics and mathematical physics, from relativity theory to quantum physics and
cosmology where I have attempted to explore the ramiﬁcations of the constructivist-
ﬁnitist motives. My objective here has been to elaborate on the foundational aspects
of arithmetical logic—the proper name of which I have dubbed modular polynomial
logic—with incursions in probability theory and theoretical and mathematical physics.
At the same time, I have been trying to see what is conceptually (and technically) going
on in contemporary ‹real› mathematics from the constructivist viewpoint of arithmetical
foundations, without too much prejudice as to what constitutes mathematical practice with
or without foundational concerns. Still, needless to say that constructivist foundations are
inherently critical of mathematical (and logical) practice in classical logic and classical
mathematics, but the critique comes from within, that is without invoking principles that
are alien to mathematical activity in its historical, epistemological and rational pursuits.

Foreword
In that endeavour, the main source of my inspiration remains André Weil with whom I
discovered both Fermat and Kronecker in the 1980s. Early on, André Weil had encouraged
me in correspondence to explore further the mathematical virtues of Fermat’s method of
inﬁnite descent and I discovered at the same time the importance of Kronecker’s general
arithmetic in Weil’s original writings on algebraic geometry (see his Œuvres scientiﬁques.
Collected Works, Springer-Verlag, 3 vols, 1980)—see my review Gauthier (1994b) of Weil
(1992). Weil has put Kronecker’s theory of forms or homogeneous polynomials and his
divisor theory (moduli systems) at the very beginning of algebraic-arithmetic geometry
with the emphasis on ﬁnite ﬁelds where Fermat’s inﬁnite descent is at work. I must also
acknowledge the beneﬁcial exchanges I have had over a period of years, either in personal
contacts or in correspondence with Henri Margenau, A. Wheeler, E.P. Wigner, I.M. Segal,
G. Chew, René Thom, N.A. Shanin, H.M. Edwards, Ed Nelson, G. Kreisel, Y. Gurevich,
U. Kohlenbach, H. Putnam, D. van Dalen, A. Urquhart, A. Joyal, Bas van Fraassen either
for scientiﬁc counsels, critical assessments or friendly approvals. All have contributed to
my understanding of the many facets of foundations, may they be logical, mathematical,
physical or philosophical.
In the writing of this opus, I have drawn freely from previous work, my two books on
the subject Internal Logic mentioned above and Logique arithmétique. L’arithmétisation
de la logique (PUL, Québec, 2010) and numerous papers that have appeared in recent years
in a variety of scientiﬁc journals, Synthese, Logique et Analyse, Revue internationale de
philosophie, Foundations of Science, International Studies in the Philosophy of Science,
Reports on Mathematical Logic, International Journal of Theoretical Physics, Journal
of Physical Mathematics, International Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics and
Reports on Mathematical Physics. Some of the ideas that are still on the forefront here
have appeared in earlier publications in Modern Logic, Zeitschrift für mathematische Logik
und Grundlagen der Mathematik and Archiv für mathematische Logik und Grundlagen-
forschung, Zeitschrift für allgemeine Wissenschaftstheorie, Notre-Dame Journal of Formal
Logic, Dialectica and Philosophy of Science, but those ideas have taken on new clothes in
my up-to-date synthesis. I have completed the writing of this work in the summer and fall
of 2014, not without the assistance of my two LATEX men, David Montminy and Benoit
Potvin. Benoit Potvin has made it possible for me to be up to the requirements of scientiﬁc
journals by diligently latexizing my papers in the last ﬁve years. He is here thanked for
his expertise as a computer scientist. I also wish to thank the Canadian Research Council
(SSHRC) for funding my research in the last four years (and many years before!). Finally,
I am grateful to Jean-Yves Béziau who has had a sympathetic ear and a friendly reception
to my work over the years.

Chapter 1
Introduction: The Internal Logic of Arithmetic
The idea of an internal logic of arithmetic or arithmetical logic is inspired by a variety
of motives in the foundations of mathematics. The development of mathematical logic in
the twentieth century, from Hilbert to the contemporary scene, could be interpreted as a
continuous tread leading to arithmetical logic. Arithmetization of analysis with Cauchy,
Weierstrass and Dedekind and arithmetization of algebra with Kronecker have lead to the
foundational inquiries initiated by Hilbert. Frege’s logical foundations of mathematics,
mainly arithmetic, have contributed to clarify philosophical motives and although Frege’s
logicism has not achieved its goals, it has given birth to Russell’s theory of types and to
some extent to Zermelo’s set-theoretic cumulative hierarchy while launching philosophical
logic and philosophy of language. But the “arithmetism” I have in mind here is mostly anti-
Fregean in that in turns logicism upside down and asks the question: “how far can we go
into logic with arithmetic alone” rather than the Fregean question: “how far can we go into
arithmetic with deductive logic alone?” It is Kronecker’s polynomial arithmetic that guides
here and the purpose of this book is to see how far a Kroneckian constructivist program
can go in the arithmetization (and algebraization) of logic in the twenty-ﬁrst century.
The present work has been conceived has a sequel to my 2002 book Internal Logic,
Foundations of Mathematics from Kronecker to Hilbert (Kluwer) and as a continuation
of my efforts towards an arithmetical logic.
Hilbert is the starting point in the arithmetization process of logic; he is the one who
introduced logic into mathematics and if he wanted to provide foundations for logic
and arithmetic at the same time, he realized later on that logic should be arithmetized
in order to provide a consistency proof for arithmetic and he adopted ﬁnally a ﬁnitist
foundational stance reminiscent of his former teacher, Kronecker. Skolem wanted also
a ﬁnitist arithmetic and Brouwer’s theory of choice sequences with his assignment of
natural numbers to members of a species (set) and sequences was a predecessor to Gödel’s
arithmetization of syntax (formal system). The birth certiﬁcate of model theory, Tarski’s
method of quantiﬁer elimination, can be traced to Kronecker’s theory of substitution-
elimination of indeterminates. The proof theory of ﬁrst-order arithmetic and its subsystems
is another witness to the arithmetization program and ﬁnally the idea of algorithm and

Introduction: The Internal Logic of Arithmetic
ramiﬁcations in complexity theory, in computer algebra and in theoretical computer
science counts certainly as one of the major achievements of such a programme. Cantor’s
transﬁnite arithmetic is also part of the arithmetization of analysis and we could pinpoint
the reasons why the Cantorian enterprise has ended in transarithmetical transﬁnite set
theory. And can analysis be constructivized? Brouwer said yes, to a certain extent. Bishop
thought that it could be arithmetized, that is, have numerical content. Non-standard
analysis with Robinson’s hyperreals goes even further in trying to give some content to
inﬁnitesimals. Cantorian set theory has nevertheless become the standard semantics of
classical logic and Peano arithmetic and it is not easy to disentangle the arithmetical
syntax from the set-theoretical semantics of contemporary logical theories, may they
be Martin-Löf’s constructive or intuitionistic type theory and other alternatives like
reverse mathematics and Feferman’s predicative mathematics. Only Nelson’s predicative
arithmetic stands out as a radical program, but it is considered too restrictive to serve as a
foundational guideline.
From a more philosophical viewpoint, Yessenin-Volpin’s ultraﬁnitism is out of touch
with actual practice and Wittgenstein’s ﬁnitist views do not seem to have grasped the full
extent of mathematical logic in the twentieth century. What is at stake is not the existence
of mathematical or logical entities, the ideal elements Hilbert had introduced to eliminate
them afterwards as a mere detour, nor the objectivity of public mathematical construction,
but the arithmetical, ultimately computational, content of logical or mathematical theory.
The objectual reality of mathematics can be summarized as the different ways it counts
physical objects and non-physical entities and how it accounts for the uncountable, if at
all. Kronecker’s attitude in that matter has been largely misinterpreted and it must be
emphasized that Kronecker’s polynomial arithmetic, which he called general arithmetic
“allgemeine Arithmetik”, has been a central theme in the advent of abstract algebra. One
must keep in mind that contemporary algebraic or arithmetic geometry has originated
in Kronecker’s work on elliptic functions, as has been pointed out by André Weil, and
Kronecker’s arithmetical ideal could be tracked in present-day grandiose programmes of
Langlands and Grothendieck. Algebraic number theory has also beneﬁted immensely from
Kronecker’s arithmetic theory of algebraic quantities—that is the subject matter of his
1882 seminal paper dedicated to Kummer—and Hermann Weyl has stressed the advan-
tages of the Kroneckerian theory of domains of rationality over Dedekind’s ideal theory.
Elementary or ordinary number theory was the arena of the ﬁrst axiomatisations by
Dedekind and Peano. Recursive functions and the idea of recurrence made an early ap-
pearance. Dedekind is supposed to have introduced that mode of thought in his “What are
and what should be numbers”—“Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen” but the procedure
is implicit in Kronecker’s theory of forms (homogeneous polynomials). Dedekind’s and
Peano’s axiomatisations are based on Cantorian set theory and they are impregnated in
a set-theoretic semantics which obnubilate the arithmetical motivations. Hilbert will be
more aware of that arithmetical background in his metamathematics devoted to formalized
mathematics in a ﬁnite system of arithmetical operators and polynomials equations (and
inequations).
Kronecker’s work has been ignored, except by mathematicians. Logicians and philoso-
phers know only his “On the concept of number” (Über den Zahlbegriff), not his most
important work by far. Frege mentioned Kronecker only once and characterized him as

an empiricist, in the like of Helmholz—which Kronecker quotes at the end of his “On
the concept of number”—then discrediting him as a non-logician. Most people associated
Kronecker with his dictum stating that “Integers are the creation of God, the rest is the
creation of man”, which is not to be found in Kronecker’s writings, but is probably
attributed to him by association! Hilbert, maybe with some resentment towards his former
professor, depicted him as a “Verbotsdiktator” or dictator of interdiction.
Arithmetization of logic took place without the contribution of the algebra of logic
before Tarski. De Morgan, Boole, Peirce, Schröder and Löwenheim were not part and
parcel of the process, except that Boole was inﬂuential in the algebrization of classical
elementary logic, which he linked to the theory of probability in his 1854 An Investigation
of the Laws of Thought. But what should be emphasized at this point is the separation
of arithmetic from number theory. The tradition of number theory from Fermat, Euler,
Gauss, Legendre, Lagrange, Dirichlet up to Kummer, Kronecker’s cherished professor,
has developed autonomously, as the queen of sciences, as Gauss would name it. Classical
number theory is not on the same footage as Dedekind-Peano arithmetic and one should
make it clear that there is no historical connection between number theory and formal
arithmetic of logical descent. However arithmetical logic is aimed at bridging the gap
between logic and arithmetic (the “true” arithmetic of number theory) and this is why
I shall be using extensively Fermat’s method of inﬁnite descent still prominent in the
work of contemporary number-theorists from Mordell to Weyl. Inﬁnite descent combined
with Kronecker’s polynomial arithmetic will reveal an essential ingredient of the program
of an arithmetical logic that I want to confront here with alternative programs in the
foundations of mathematics. In so doing, I hope to connect historical, philosophical,
logical, mathematical and foundational questions—foundations being the synthesis of
all—into a uniﬁed treatment and propose a new framework for the philosophical question
and the mathematical problem of the consistency of arithmetic. The programme of
arithmetical logic ﬁnds its ﬁnal justiﬁcation in the internal logic of arithmetic, an internal
logic that shows that arithmetic has to be self-consistent if it is to be the building stone of
logic and mathematics.1

Chapter 2
Arithmetization of Analysis and Algebra
Arithmetization of analysis evokes at once the names of Cauchy, Weierstrass, Cantor
and Dedekind and to a lesser degree those of Dirichlet, Abel or Bolzano; the process
of arithmetization illustrates the need to instill rigour in analysis through what Cauchy
called algebraic analysis in order to overcome the intuitive limitations of the geometer’s
method of proof. The story of arithmetization needs not to be retold here (see Grattan-
Guinness 1970); it is not a one-sided history, for rigour had a different meaning then and
the tools used for rigorization (e.g. quadratic forms or homogeneous polynomials) were
partly available in the nineteenth century. The algebraic symbolism (Descartes, Fermat
and Leibniz) was already invading geometry and number theory (Diophantine equations)
from Fermat on was to become the queen of arithmetical sciences.
2.1
Cauchy and Weierstrass
In the introduction of his 1821 Cours d’analyse, Cauchy warns that: “It would be a
serious error to think that certainty can be found only in geometrical demonstration or
in the testimony of the senses”, but he begins with an algebraic analysis of real functions
and their limits, polynomials as continuous functions and of convergent and divergent
series. Cauchy still talks of inﬁnitively small quantities or inﬁnitesimals, but he equals
them with limits approached by real-valued functions. He introduces there the convolution
product—also named Cauchy product—for convergent series and recursive series (“séries
récurrentes”) or polynomials in the increasing or decreasing order of their powers. Cauchy
achievement resides in his precise deﬁnitions of limits 0 and 1 for an inﬁnite quantity.
When the successive values given to the same variable approach indeﬁnitely a ﬁxed value in such
a way as to differ from it as little as one wishes, this ﬁxed value is called the limit of all the other
values (Cauchy 1847, p. 14)
Weierstrass has not been satisﬁed with Cauchy’s notion of a variable approaching a
limit. In his text “Theorie der Maxima und Minima von Functionnen einer und mehrerer

Arithmetization of Analysis and Algebra
Veränderlichen” or Theory of maxima and minima of functions of one and many variables,
Weierstrass innovates with his idea of the   ı method.
For a function f.x/, one says that its value at x D a is a minimum when it is smaller for x D a than
all the neighboring values of x, that is when a positive quantity ı can be determined such that
f.a C h/  f.a/ > 0
with jhj < ı. And the values of a function f.x/ for x D a is called a maximum, when for all values
under the restriction h < ı, one has
f.a C h/  f.a/ < 0
(Weierstrass 1894–1927, p. 7)
Weierstrass then shows that for the derivative
f.a C h/  f.a/ D hf 0.a C h/
a quantity is needed with the sufﬁcient condition
0 <  < 1
and the ﬁrst necessary condition for the existence of a minimum or a minimum for f.x/
at x D a is that F0.a/ D 0; the second necessary condition is that in the sequence of
derivatives the ﬁrst non-vanishing derivative for x D a must be of even order. Weierstrass
goes on and generalizes easily these conditions to many-variable functions (Weierstrass
1894–1927, p. 7).
The interesting fact here is that Weierstrass couches his ideas in the language of
quadratic forms (homogeneous polynomials): these are the arithmetical foundations by
excellence in the number-theoretic tradition since Gauss. Of course Bolzano has already
proven that polynomials are continuous and Weierstrass had only to deﬁne a vanishing
positive deﬁnitive form as one whose variable have all the value 0 (Weierstrass 1894–
1927, p. 20). Further considerations have to do with Sturm’s theorem on changed signs
in the real roots of an algebraic equation; Kronecker had also dealt with reﬁnements
of Sturm’s theorem as he has criticized Bolzano’s intermediate value theorem for being
imprecise, since the interval for the values was not deﬁned, although Bolzano had believed
to arithmetize the geometrical intuitive proofs for continuous functions. But Cantor and
Dedekind will give a new twist of the history of arithmetization in extending the more
or less constructive methods of their predecessors into a new array of non-constructive
techniques.
2.2
Dedekind and Cantor
From Dedekind’s side, arithmetization is a logical enterprise to the extent that proof and
provable are interwoven in mathematical constructions, and the logic he has in mind is
internal to arithmetic or the science of number (“Wissenschaft der Zahlen”). Irrational

numbers, Dedekind insists, must be grounded arithmetically, but foundations have to be
general or abstract, for the science of number is a priori, independent of space and time;
this is why Dedekind speaks of things and systems of things as the building blocks
of arithmetic (Dedekind 1965). Soon enough, those concrete building blocks will be
assembled by abstract concepts like mappings (Abbildungen) and images (Bilder). Chains
(Kette) remain the concrete links for the assembly-line of things and systems. In Dedekind
chain of thought however, the highest point is his uniﬁcation of an inﬁnite system as a
system which is in bijection with a proper part of itself, that is excluding itself; otherwise,
a system is ﬁnite. The proof of the statement has been diversely appreciated—some
have downgraded it as a metaphysical or psychological proof—it involves “the world
of my thoughts” (“meine Gendankenwelt”) as an actual inﬁnite system, while Dedekind
expressly says that the world of my thoughts, that is the totality of things that can be objects
of my thought, is inﬁnite, which points out to a potential inﬁnite at most (Dedekind 1965,
p. 14). It is not without reason that Dedekind notes that there is a similar consideration
in the Platonist Bolzano. One could say there is a clash here between the arithmetical
potentialities and the set-theoretical actuality of the transarithmetical or transcendental
world.
In Dedekind’s hands, the construction of the natural number system with complete in-
duction as a simply inﬁnite bijection system N ! N is straightforward. In a sharp contrast,
the construction of the rational and irrational numbers in his “Stetigkeit und irrational
Zahlen” (Continuity and irrational numbers) is completed in a purely arithmetical style,
as if we are entering the real mathematical world with rational and irrational numbers.
Dedekind’s writes:
I see the whole arithmetic as a necessary or at least as a natural consequence of the simplest
arithmetical act of counting, and counting itself as nothing more than the successive creation of
the unending sequence of positive whole numbers (integers): : : (Dedekind 1965, II, p. 5)
The idea of a chain is born out of the step by step unfolding of numbers in their natural
succession, rational numbers when compared to a point or straight line, are situated on
the right or on the left of a given point and on the continuous line there is an inﬁnity of
points which do not correspond to any rational number. The essence of continuity lies in
the principle:
If we cut the straight line in two segments (or classes) in such a manner as to put all the points of
the ﬁrst segment to the left of any point of the second segment, then there is only one point that
divides all the points in two segments of the straight line. (Dedekind 1965, II, p. 10)
A cut (“Schnitt”) (A1; A2) has the meaning that every rational number in A1 is smaller
than any number in A2 and also that there is either a largest number in A1 or a smallest
number in A2. It follows immediately that there is an inﬁnity of cuts in the straight line
that are not generated by rational numbers which therefore do not exhaust the whole
continuous line. So an irrational number like
p
2 is represented by an irrational cut. Total
order and Dedekind-completeness of the real line are properties directly following from
the cut construction, since supremum and inﬁmum are consequences of the theorem that
there is only one number that cuts the system of all real numbers in two. Dedekind also
saw his theory of cuts as applying easily to differential calculus or inﬁnitesimal analysis
because of the centrality of the concept of continuity.

Arithmetization of Analysis and Algebra
Of greater importance to us is Dedekind emphasis on the arithmetic construction of the
real continuum; for him, the main guiding principle, despite the set-theoretic overtones,
is the arithmetic process that extends in a natural way ordinary arithmetic into higher
arithmetic (number theory and algebra) and analysis. In the same arithmetical spirit, Cantor
went even further into a transﬁnite arithmetic that would exhaust not only the real line, but
also the real arithmetic spirit itself by immersion in the set-theoretic universe!
At the beginning, Cantor was interested in number theory and algebra, as his ﬁrst
writing reveals. Indeed, his 1867 dissertation deals with quadratic forms (homogeneous
polynomials) and one of his thesis is that purely arithmetical methods prevail over
analytical ones. These writings seem to be mere exercises on problems raised by number-
theorists from Gauss to Kronecker (his professor in Berlin) until he reaches the rich terrain
of trigonometric functions where his mathematical talent ﬁnds its start. Cantor inherits
from Riemann and Heine the problem of how to represent a real-valued function f.x/ by a
convergent trigonometric series for all the values of x and show that there is no other series
of the same form which is convergent and uniquely represent the said function f.x/. In
other words, it is the problem of the canonical representation of a real-valued function
by a trigonometric series. In the course of his work on the canonical representation,
Cantor came to beneﬁt from Kronecker’s comments for a simpliﬁcation of his proof; the
simpliﬁcation amounted to evince inﬁnitesimals by using two arithmetical expressions
y C x and y  x where y is a constant in order to cancel or make vanish the inﬁnitesimal
coefﬁcients
lim.cnnx/ D 0
for n D 1
It is interesting to note that Cantor’s rejection of inﬁnitesimals originates in Kronecker’s
arithmetization program. But Cantor was quick to ﬁnd another use for his ﬁnite limits
in his theory of derived sets of points. As I said, Cantor did not rest content with
the arithmetical simpliﬁcations (or restrictions) suggested by Kronecker and went on
extending his results on trigonometric series in 1872. Here Cantor develops a theory
of limit points (“Grenzpunkte”) or accumulation points (“Häufungspunkte”), which is
of geometric inspiration (with Cartesian coordinates) even if it looks like Weierstrass’
arithmetical theory from the outside. Cantor’s inﬁnitary inclination is apparent in his
propension to include the inﬁnite as well as the ﬁnite in his mathematical research.
The limit point of a set of points P is a point on the straight line such that every
neighborhood of that point contains an inﬁnity of points, but in the interior (“in seinem
Innern”) of the (real) interval. We have here the ﬁrst lineaments of point-set topology.
Cantor denotes P0 the set of limit points as the ﬁrst derived set of points of P, if that
derived set of points contains an inﬁnite number of points, P has a second derived set of
points denoted by P00 and so on till P.v/ for the vth derived set of points. The construction
of an unending series of derived sets of points opens the way for a theory of fundamental
sequences, deﬁned by
lim
v!1.˛vC  ˛v/ D 0

2.2
Dedekind and Cantor

and in general
lim
v!1 ˇv D ˇ:
Those sequences remind us of Cauchy sequences, but where Cauchy and his followers
saw a limit, Cantor took that limit symbol as a radical departure from traditional views. He
wrote:
One should pay attention to this cardinal point, the signiﬁcance of which could easily be
misunderstood in the third deﬁnition of the real number—with the help of fundamental sequences
as in
lim
v!1 ˛v D b
number b is not deﬁned as the bound (“Grenze”) of the parts of a fundamental sequence (˛v), it
would be a logical mistake similar to our discussion of the ﬁrst deﬁnition—of a limit as a sum—
where the existence of the bound
lim
v!1 ˛v
would only be presumed; it is much more the other way around, since from our former deﬁnitions
of the concept with its properties and relations in the rational number system we can conclude
with certainty that the limit exists and is equal to b. Forgive my insistence on this apparent triﬂe
(“Kleinigkeit”). . . (Cantor 1966, p. 187)
Cantor goes on and declares that the irrational numbers derive the same status of
determinate reality in our mind (“bestimmte Realität”) as do the rational numbers. Then
lim bv D b
also exists and arbitrary high orders of fundamental sequences exist as well. I see in this
passage the birth certiﬁcate of transﬁnite set theory with the unlimited generation of orders
of fundamental sequences becoming inﬁnite ordinals of the second number class

Arithmetization of Analysis and Algebra
Cantor even imagined a third number class
0; v; : : : !; !C1; : : :
in a transﬁnite hierarchy of ordinals, but the totality  of all ordinals like the totality
( , taw) of all cardinals would not be a set, but an absolute inconsistent plurality (“eine
absolut inkonsistent Vielheit”).
There is no doubt however that Cantor conceived his theory of transﬁnite numbers as
an extension of the arithmetic continuum. He explained that in the past there has not been
a satisfactory logico-mathematical treatment of the continuum (Cantor 1966, p. 190 and
ss). The ﬁrst generation principle (“Erzeugungsprinzip”), he explained, was the addition of
unity to a given number—the ﬁrst number class of ﬁnite ordinals,—the second generation
principle simply applies the same procedure to limit ordinals ! up to . In the same
1882 paper “On inﬁnite linear sets of (multiplicities) of points” (“Über unendliche lineare
Punktmannigfaltigkeiten”) Cantor formulated his continuum hypothesis
@0 < 2@0 D @1
still unproven. Cantor was probably devising his own “Mannigfaltigkeitslehre” or theory
of multiplicities in the footsteps of Riemann who had introduced his n-dimensional
multiplicities (manifolds) in differential geometry. The analogy is certainly in Cantor’s
mind when he mentioned n-dimensional continuum, but to his great surprise he found
out that n-dimensional continua have the same cardinality (“MRachtigkeit”) as the linear
continuum, that is c D 2@0. Brouwer has shown afterwards that beyond that set-theoretic
characterization, there is no homeomorphism between continua of different dimensions.
My intention is not to draw a complete picture of Cantor’s set-theoretic landscape, but
only delineate the essential elements that will be kept alive in the following tradition of
arithmetization.
We know that Hilbert wanted to keep the Cantorian paradise open to ideal elements and
he hoped to solve the continuum hypothesis (the ﬁrst problem of his famous 1900 list), but
he returned at the end to the safe haven of Kroneckerian ﬁnitism. Peano himself inherited
the set-theoretic model for his axiomatic number theory, but he left to others the business of
arithmetical logic. Gödel employed Cantor’s diagonal method in his incompleteness proof
for Peano arithmetic, but he renounced transﬁnite ordinal arithmetic in his later attempts
to prove the consistency of arithmetic.
I give a sketch of the diagonal method in the following. Cantor introduced the diagonal
method in his 1890 paper (“Über eine elementare Frage der Mannigfaltigkeitslehre”) (On
an elementary question of the theory of multiplicities), in order to prove that the power
set P.X/ of an inﬁnite set X is strictly greater than X or card X < card P.X/. Already
in 1874 (Cantor 1966, pp. 115–118), he had shown that the set R of real numbers is not
denumerable by an argument involving algebraic numbers of the form
a0!n C a1!n1 C : : : C an D 0I

2.2
Dedekind and Cantor

here the !’s are simply reals—and the described polynomials have ﬁnite degree n and
therefore algebraic numbers have a denumerable cardinality. The totality ! of such
numbers can be arranged in a sequence
!1; !2; : : : ; !n; : : :
Using Liouville proof in 1844 on the existence of irrational transcendental (non-algebraic)
numbers that can only be approximated by rationals, Cantor concludes that if there
are more numbers in the real interval than the algebraic irrationals, then they are not
denumerable. The diagonal appears at ﬁrst less as an existence proof and more as a
constructive method, but there is less than meets the eye. Cantor starts here with an inﬁnite
coordinate system M of elements with two “characters” m and w and dresses up an inﬁnite
array of sequences E of those elements
E1 D .m; m; m; m; : : : /
E2 D .w; w; w; w; : : : /
E3 D .m; w; m; w; : : : /
He then supposes that the totality of those sequences is not in bijection with the sequence
of natural numbers, is not denumerably inﬁnite with cardinality @0.
One has only to show that the denumerable array of sequences representing real
numbers
E1 D .a1;1; a1;2; : : : ; a1;; : : : /
E2 D .a2;1; a2;2; : : : ; a2;; : : : /
: : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : :
E D .a;1; a;2; : : : ; a;; : : : /
does not exhaust M, the set of real numbers in the interval .m; w/ or .0; 1/ since the
sequence
E D .b1; b2; b3; : : :/
deﬁned by b ¤ a; is not there, because the elements b are taken to be different from
any element a in the diagonal of E1 to E. The elements bi are taken on the antidiagonal
or on the codiagonal, as I prefer to say, since they are drawn from the complement R  N
of the presumed list of all natural numbers. Instead of Liouville expression
jx  p
qj > M
qn
where x is an algebraic irrational of degree n, p, q and M are integers, we have in Cantor
card N < card M

12

Arithmetization of Analysis and Algebra
for N the natural numbers and M the totality (“Inbegriff”) of real numbers. Cantor’s
method is nonetheless existential or non-constructive in the sense that it picks up freely
in the complement M  N diagonal elements different from all elements in a denumerable
diagonal list. Real numbers are more numerous than natural numbers and transcendental
numbers are the most numerous among the reals; since the element b is picked up
randomly in the complement M  N, it is most probably a transcendental element. At
the end of the 1880 paper, Cantor felt free to embark on his continuing search for larger
actually inﬁnite powers (“Mächtigkeiten”) M0 < M1 < : : : < Mn and believed that their
succession constitute a well-ordered set, thus building up on an extension of ﬁnite number
theory by other means (Cantor 1966, p. 280). But Cantor was now to discover that the
totality of all powers did not amount to a consistent set, but to an absolutely inconsistent
plurality.
Cantor’s diagonal method gave rise to paradoxes, one of them, Richard’s antinomy goes
like this: suppose that I want to enumerate all sentences in the French language which
denote a real number, for instance, the ratio between the circumference and the diameter
of the circle, that is ; I then put these sentences in a lexicographical order and call the nth
real number of the enumeration the nth Richard number
rn D 0; an1an2 : : : ann
in a decimal expansion. Deﬁne a diagonal real number; the real number whose nth decimal
is 1, if the nth decimal of the Richard number is not 1 and whose nth decimal is 2, if the
nth decimal of the Richard number is 1, that sentence deﬁnes a Richard number, say the
rth Richard number, but it differs from the Richard number previously deﬁned by the rth
decimal. What we have is rnn D 1, if ann ¤ 1 and rnn D 2, iff ann D 1; we have a
Richard number bn which is different from all the rn and consequently it does not belong
in the enumeration whilst it is deﬁned by a ﬁnite number of letters in the lexicographical
order. Gödel was inspired by the paradox, as well as by the liar’s paradox, his logical use
of Cantor’s diagonal method leading him to an undecidable sentence stating of itself that
it was not provable. Another logical use of Cantor’s theorem—which stipulates that for
set x, the cardinality of the set is smaller than its power set—is Skolem paradox which
goes like this: in a ﬁrst-order logical theory, there is no bijection between the set ! of
natural numbers and P.! its power set, for a ﬁrst-order language can only entertain
! being of cardinality @0, but a ﬁrst-order theory may have a model of arbitrary high
cardinality, like 2@0, by the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem. The question is : how could a
ﬁrst-order theory say anything about a non-denumerable model? In fact, the set P.!/ is
denumerable in the model of ﬁrst-order theory as seen from the outside and there is a
bijection between ! and P.!/, but that bijection is not the model as seen from the inside.
Such a paradoxical situation is derivable simply because the notion of cardinality and other
set-theoretic notions are semantically relative—to a model—or that set-theoretic semantics
cannot be absolute or invariant, as Skolem had remarked.
In conclusion, could Cantor’s transﬁnite number theory be counted as a legitimate
extension of the arithmetization program like number theory or p-adic analysis? And
Conway’s surreal numbers, are they an extension of Dedekind’s notion of cut? Extensions
of number theory and completions (of number ﬁelds) are not on the same footing.

2.3
Frege

One thing is sure, many mathematicians have renounced the Cantorian paradise (among
those the so-called French semi-intuitionists or pre-intuitionists, notably Poincaré). André
Weil, one of the major number theorists of the twentieth century did not admit Cantor’s
diagonal method as a valid method of proof in number theory. Weil had constructivist
leanings and one of his privileged methods was Fermat’s inﬁnite descent which he
characterized as a “method of ﬁnite descent in ﬁnite number ﬁelds”. For the arithmetician,
the denumerable means “denumerable at inﬁnity” and this involves only the unlimited
sequence of natural numbers, not a completed actual inﬁnity.
2.3
Frege
Neo-logicism has been milling Hume’s principle to rejuvenate Frege’s logicism, but the
lurking problem is the logical status of the principle (see Burgess 2005). On the face of
it, Hume’s principle is an abstraction principle that cannot count as being arithmetical in
Frege’s hands, although in his Treatise of Human Nature, Hume was only concerned with
numerical equality that we can express
8R8SŒ.Num .R/ D Num S// $ R  S
for R and S numerical relations: it says that numerical relations e.g. in algebra, are equal
if the numbers they relate are also equal in arithmetic. Hume thought that it is only
in arithmetic and algebra and not in geometry, that we can have a perfect exactness of
equality (Hume 1978, i, p. 3, 1). Hume’s idea accords quite well with the counting process
“Zahlen” omnipresent in the arithmetization program, whereas Frege deals with concepts
and general undetermined objets (“allgemeine unbestimmte Gegenstände”) and his basic
law V in the Grundgesetze der Arithmetic (§36) states
8F8GŒExt.F/ D Ext.G/ $ 8x.Fx  Gx/
that is, two concepts have the same extension, iff they have the same “general” objects.
Law V gives rise immediately to the unlimited comprehension principle
9x8y.y 2 x $ P.y//
and Russell’s contradictory instance when one substitutes general object x for y.
The truth is that new logicism, from C. Wright to G. Boolos, does not so much
rehabilitate Frege’s logicism as it tries to adopt it to second-order arithmetical theories,
for instance Peano’s arithmetic, by having recourse to Hume’s principle which was
arithmetical as a numerical equality. Frege’s initial idea of an internal logic of arithmetic
was to see how far one could go in arithmetic by deduction alone:
Wie weit man in der Arithmetik durch Schlüsse allein gelangen könnte, (Frege 1983, X.)

14

Arithmetization of Analysis and Algebra
Logical consequence, as Frege says, must mimick the sequential or serial order of
arithmetic (addition as a paradigm) insuring thus the uniformity of a process totally
independent of intuition. This was also the idea behind his 1874 Jena habilitation work
on the methods of calculation “based on the extension of the concept of quantity”.
Addition represents then the primary operation or for the foundation of arithmetic or as
a conceptualization of arithmetic in the sense that arithmetic remains the archetype of a
theory of concepts. This would explain the intention or motivation of Frege’s later work
on the notions of concept, object and function or on sense and reference; the resulting
philosophy of concept or philosophy of language could then ﬁt into the grand scheme of
a general philosophy based on an arithmetical model. My interpretation is not orthodox
here for it evacuates the essence of logicism understood as a full-ﬂedged foundation
of arithmetic and mathematics on logic. But what if logic is not the formalization of
arithmetic, as Frege seems to have taught us? If Frege takes refuge in geometry after
his attempt of conceptualization of arithmetic away from intuition and experience, it
is because he believed that geometry is the sole source of (experiential) mathematical
knowledge and that the spatio-temporal continuum (as in Kant) is the origin of the idea of
the inﬁnite; he also acknowledged that his notion of number as the extension of a concept
was a failure. One is tempted to say here that concepts play the role of Kronecker’s
indeterminates while numbers take the place of integral coefﬁcients in a polynomial
expression, the difference being that indeterminates as dummy variables do not have a
conceptual or Platonic existence conferred to Frege’s general indeterminate objects: only
numbers as counting symbols subsist in the ﬂatland of arithmetic.
The fate of logic in Frege’s project is certainly dependent upon the formalization of
the function concept. Function and argument are derived from polynomial functions in
arithmetic and Frege is quite explicit on this in his Preface to the Begriffsschrifft: his
formalization of a “formula language for pure thought” is modeled upon the formula
language of arithmetic. In a nutshell, then, Frege’s intent was at ﬁrst the arithmetization
of ordinary (Aristotelian) logic, a project that ﬁnally ended in a logicization of arithmetic
which could build on the whole of arithmetic up to function theory, i.e. summation and
integration. The arithmetical ideal is echoed in the 1877 Begriffsschrift where a formalized
language is designed to the sole purpose of translating the informal language of arithmetic.
There is no sign of “logicization” here, nor in the 1884 Grundlagen der Arithmetik in
which Frege is satisﬁed with a logico-mathematical research on the concept of number.
All this is still compatible with the arithmetization program and even with the non-logicist
mode of speech that one ﬁnds in Dedekind and Cantor.
Thus it seems that the logicist program of a logical conceptualization of arithmetic is
merely philosophical and is not meant as an alternative to the current arithmetical foun-
dations of mathematics, at least up to the Grundgezetze where the philosophical program
emerges. But one could interpret Frege’s anti-Kantian or non-aprioristic proposal, not so
much as a logicist imperative but as a philosophical motive akin to Leibniz’s calculus
philosophicus or ratiocinator. But the idea of a rational formalism or ideography is purely
an extension of arithmetic for the representation of classical logical judgments in the ﬁrst
two parts of the Begriffsschrift, whereas the third part deals with a notational representation
of sequences that could extend to calculus and even to analysis situs (topology) and
physics. Frege’s philosophical dream is driven by an arithmetical spirit; it is a pity that

2.4
Russell, Peano and Zermelo
15
Frege had not taken into account another extension of arithmetic, Kronecker’s polynomial
or general arithmetic (“allgemeine Arithmetik”), a purely mathematical development, in
his conceptual enterprise. One could conclude that Frege’s formal logic is nothing more
than a general arithmetic for the needs of philosophical conceptualization. The fact that
Frege’s formalization (without its notational system) has facilitated Russell’s theory of
deﬁnite descriptions is a sign of its philosophical fertility, not of its mathematical richness.
My interpretation of logicism attempts at showing that Frege’s so-called logicist program
is born in arithmetic and is not destined to provide foundations for arithmetic and the
whole of mathematics, but rather to continue arithmetic by other means.
Formal logic was initiated by Aristotle, it was arithmetized by Frege and made into
a fully arithmetized theory by Hilbert and his school. Philosophical logic was made
possible by Frege. Mathematical logic was realized by Hilbert. In between stands Russell
whose type theory is a hybrid creature which was the incentive for the conception and
demise of logicism as traditionally understood. After the dismissal of Frege’s attempted
arithmetical theory of concepts, Russell’s enterprise as well as Hilbert’s and Zermelo’s
axiomatizations could be seen as polynomializations of logic. Notwithstanding Quine’s
precept that second-order logic is no more logic, but mathematics, the proposal that
second-order logic with Hume’s equinumerical principle is equivalent to second-order
Peano arithmetic should not impress the mathematical logician who does not care much
about the philosophical underpinnings of his ﬁeld. This is why my arithmetization of
Frege’s logicism should not surprise him no more that my following characterization of
Russell’s logicism as a polynomial calculus of degrees (orders) of propositional functions
that look alike polynomial functions. Moreover the problems encountered in Russell’s
theory of types (simple or ramiﬁed) could have been solved by reverting to a theory of
polynomials of ﬁnite degree as the ﬁnite support of inﬁnite power series. That Russell was
partly aware of such a solution is the theme of the next section.
2.4
Russell, Peano and Zermelo
The incentive of Russell’s invention of the different theories of classes, the zigzag theory,
the limitation of size theory, and the no-classes theory is certainly his formulation of the
paradox for Frege’s unlimited comprehension axiom V of the Grundgezetze: the invention
of type theory was more in accordance with a simple arithmetical solution to the paradox.
It is not difﬁcult to see that the hierarchy of the simple theory of types with the ﬁrst
type 0 assigned to objects or individuals, the second to predicates, the third to predicates
of predicates and so on is on a natural number scale. Transﬁnite type theory is a later
extension; it was not considered by Russell. In that respect, it resembles closely Peano’s
axiomatization of arithmetic and the vicious-circle principle
Whatever contains an apparent (bound) variable must not be a possible value of that variable.
(Russell 1966, p. 163)
is there to prevent contradiction from arising. The ramiﬁed theory of types is a theory
of types for propositional functions, whose type depends on the types of their arguments

16
2
Arithmetization of Analysis and Algebra
but also on the types on bound variables they contain (which can be of a higher type than
the argument of the function). This forced Russell to introduce the notion of order and
the ensuing axiom of reducibility which states that any function of arbitrary order n is
coextensive with a predicative function of order n1, that is one of order equal to the type
of its bound variables. Had Russell thought of propositional functions as polynomials—the
translation from the one to the other is simple—he would have seen no need to introduce
the notion of order, for the notion of degree would have sufﬁced: the degree (or order)
of a polynomial is the maximum of the degrees of all the terms in the polynomial. The
same applies to Weyl’s predicative theory of levels: Weyl was however well aware of
the analogy of his hierarchy of levels with the hierarchy of polynomials of ﬁnite order—
their extensions of inﬁnite order are (formal) power series. In any event, the ramiﬁed type
theory was designed to tackle paradoxes—Russell called them reﬂexive fallacies—outside
of mathematics and Ramsey advised Russell that he should simply drop it in favor of the
simple theory of types. But Russell had added an axiom of inﬁnity, not having power
series of inﬁnite order. In this type theory, @0 must exist as the class of ﬁnite cardinals, i.e.
in Russell’s words, @0 exists as the cardinal of the class of classes of classes of individuals
and 2@0 exists as the class of classes of classes of classes of individuals! The enterprise of
Principa Mathematica co-authored with A.N. Whitehead was conducted on the ﬁrm basis
of a ﬁnite type theory. The remains of Russell’s endeavor are found however in his logic
and his philosophy of language (the theory of descriptions) e.g. the actual king of France
is bald
9xŒ..'x/ ^ 8y.'y ! x D y// ^  x
Russell used x as the deﬁnite descriptor.
As far as logic is concerned, Russell defends Frege’s alleged thesis that mathematics
should be based on logic, as exempliﬁed in Principia Mathematica. But the exempliﬁca-
tion as it is easily observed, is mainly notational and in many cases superﬂuous. If the
deﬁnitional logic of classes is set-theoretic, type theory could be recast in polynomial
arithmetic. As for Frege, the formal language of logic is entirely comprised in propositional
connectives and ﬁrst-order logic and if one follows Quine’s dogma, it means the whole
of logic. Later, Lindström will characterize (ﬁrst-order) logic as the language with the
properties of compactness and Löwenheim-Skolem. First-order logic consists in the
employment of quantiﬁers 9x (introduced by Russell) for “exists” and 8x (introduced
by Gentzen) Alle, for “all”, 0-order logic being the employment of connectives. The
propositional content in both cases is ﬁrst of all ordinary language and afterwards only
specialized languages, e.g. elementary mathematics. Formal logic separates sentences
(closed expressions) from formulas (open expressions) with constants and variables
(bound and free), well-formed formulas are generated by rules of formation in a vocabulary
and rules of transformation—in Carnap’s parlance—or inference allow for the passage
from axioms to theorems, e.g. modus ponens. Peano’s Formulaire seems to be plagued with
an absence of logical content despite his use of the notion of indeterminates for variable

2.4

signs. Peano arithmetic is still the basic system for arithmetic for logical purposes: his
axiom of induction (in the Formulaire reads) :
If a set F of natural numbers contains one and if, containing an arbitrary number a it contains also
its successor, then S contains all natural numbers. (Peano 1959, p. 35)
This is a second-order formulation and it corresponds to the axiom of inﬁnity in
Zermelo-Fraenkel axiomatic set theory
9xf; 2 x ^ 8y.y 2 x ! y [ fyg 2 x/g
for {y} as the singleton (or the one-element set). This formulation links clearly Peano
arithmetic to Cantor’s naive set theory, whence our notion of set-theoretic arithmetic.
Zermelo’s axiomatization of set-theory had also the goal of eliminating the paradox-
ical consequence of the axiom of unlimited comprehension of Frege’s law V in the
Grundgesteze and limited comprehension is expressed by axiom of separation (Ausson-
derungsaxiom), in Zermelo (1908a)
8x9x8z.z 2 y $ z 2 x ^ A.z//:
Zermelo is also prompted to attack Peano’s Formulaire and its tentative reduction
of mathematics to syllogisms in the Aristotelian-Scholastic sense (Zermelo 1908a,b). It
behooves to admit that Zermelo resumed with the arithmetical spirit of Cantor’s endeavor,
if only to introduce, as he said, some restrictions to Cantor’s theory; in his work on
ﬁnite sets which he identiﬁed with elementary arithmetic (Zermelo 1909), Zermelo did
not hope to restrict himself to ﬁnite sets and believed that the well-ordering principle for
natural numbers could be extended into the transﬁnite. But the axiomatic set theory he
initiated was to be reworked by others, Skolem, Fraenkel, von Neumann among them. Von
Neumann who introduced the axiom of foundation or regularity

quotes Mirimanoff (1917) who did deﬁne “ordinary sets” as those which generate only
ﬁnite descent—there is no inﬁnite descending sequence of elements e1 3 e2 3 e3 : : : for
it must stop at an indecomposable element ;, called also core (“noyau”) by Mirimanoff.
Mirimanoff who was familiar with Fermat’s method of inﬁnite descent in number theory
was followed also by Skolem who spoke of descending -sequences in his 1922 paper
“Some remarks on the axiomatic foundation of set theory”; such sequences have also to
terminate in the ﬁnite. In the same paper, Skolem stresses the fact that set-theoretic notion
are relative, result that would prompt Gödel to deﬁne absolute formulas in a minimal inner
model of Z-F.

in completed inﬁnite totalities have an absolute meaning or is it only relative to ﬁnite
arithmetic, as Skolem would have put it?
A number-theoretician or a constructivist logician in the lineage of Kronecker—as was
Skolem—cannot but deny absolute existence or validity to the full set-theoretic universe.
But many want to retrieve the arithmetical content of set theory, as Cauchy, Weierstrass
and Dedekind and Hilbert hoped to achieve for analysis where the notion of limit was
put to test by arithmetical methods, e.g. when it was not simply removed. What happened
with Cantor goes the other way around: the limit concept was actualized and ordinalized,
meaning that limit ordinals are not to be approached, they exist de facto and de jure by the
sanction of a transcendent decree—Kronecker would have added that actual existence of
these entities was a matter of philosophy or theology, not of mathematics.
A more tolerant attitude would simply deﬁne transﬁnite arithmetic as transarithmatic
extension of arithmetic to the beneﬁt of a few customers. What happened after Cantor is
that free creation attracted more people than the rigid Kronecker would have dreamed
of. There is no question of binding or bending mathematical imagination, but the
Kroneckerian heritage in pure mathematics, number theory and algebraic or arithmetic
geometry seems to have been more fruitful that the Cantorian inﬂuence, which however,
has spread rapidly in elementary mathematics, in the language of mathematics and in
foundational issues. Algebra as the proper extension of arithmetic is the right place to
look for the development of general arithmetic in the Kroneckerian sense.

Kronecker and the Arithmetization of Algebra
It could seem paradoxical that Kronecker entitled his program “the arithmetization of
algebra” since algebra is another name for general arithmetic or “allgemeine Arithmetic”.
Hankel in his 1867 “Prinzip der Permanenz der formalen Gesetze” (Principle of the
permanence of formal laws) after Peacock’s “principle of the permanence of equivalent
forms”, hoped to extend the laws of ordinary arithmetic to different number systems (e.g.
complex numbers). Kronecker’s ambition is different. In a letter to Lipschitz (1896), he
writes :
On that occasion [the publication of his 1882 paper], I have found the long-sought foundations of
my entire theory of forms which somehow bring to completion “the arithmetization of algebra”
which has been the goal of my entire mathematical life. It is entirely clear to me that at the same
time arithmetic cannot dispense with the “association of forms” and that without them, it only goes
astray in meandering thoughts “Gendankenspinste” as in the case with Dedekind, when the true
nature of the matter is obscured rather than illuminated.
Lipschitz 1896 (Gauthier 2002, pp. 181–182)
The 1882 paper in question is of course the major publication “Fundamental features of
an arithmetical theory of algebraic quantities” (“Grundzüge einer arithmetishen Theorie
der algebraishen Grössen”) where he lays the foundations of his theory of forms
(homogeneous polynomials). Beyond the polemical tone, one sees the central rôle of his
1882 formulation.
In the Kroneckerian approach, the transﬁnite construction of algebraically closed ﬁelds is avoided
by the simple expedient of adjoining new algebraic numbers to Q as needed.
(Edwards 1987a,b, p. 97)
Here adjoining new algebraic numbers constitutes a numerical extension, whereas an
algebraically closed ﬁeld is obtained by a universal (transﬁnite) quantiﬁcation on all
natural numbers. What this means is that the adjunction in the Kroneckerian approach
proceeds “step by step”, in extending the ﬁeld, not in the Dedekind’s transcendental
set-theoretic way of completing the ﬁeld Q in one stroke. As for the general setting of
Kronecker’s theory of forms, it is that very generality—independent of the ambient ﬁeld,
as one says—that is responsible for its foundational import. Kronecker’s arithmetization
programme can be summarized in the title “General Arithmetic” which contains, in
Kronecker’s words, the complete development of the theory of entire (rational and
algebraic) functions of a variable together with the system of divisors. In this complete
theory, the association of forms allows for the conservation of the laws of factorization, so
that the passage from natural and rational domains to the more general algebraic domains
(of algebraic integers) is perfectly uniform (Kronecker 1968a,b, III, pp. 350–351). The
conservative extension of arithmetic up to the highest reaches of algebra—the theory of
entire rational and algebraic functions—is the ultimate goal of general arithmetic deﬁned
as the theory of all forms with an arbitrary number of indeterminates.
It has been noticed why Kronecker has preferred the term “domain of rationality”
“Rationalitätsbereich” to the term “Körper”, “ﬁeld” in English. While “ﬁeld” is rather
innocuous, “Körper”, “corps” in French, was too “material” for Kronecker. Whether there
is an idealistic overtone implied here is open to question—what about ideals and ideal

Arithmetization of Analysis and Algebra
numbers? In any case, the notion of integral domains and unique factorization domains are
well known today and are part of contemporary algebra.
What does Kronecker understand by the foundation of the arithmetical existence of
algebraic quantities, as W. Hodges asks in his treatise on model theory (Hodges 1993).
Kronecker’s answer is in the title of chapter 13 of the ﬁrst part of his paper, but the
real answer is in chapter XII on “The general theory of rational functions of several
indeterminate quantities”. Starting with Galois’s and Abel’s theory of algebraic equations,
Kronecker wants to develop a theory of all equations of a given class for a given
domain of rationality, a problem which has escaped Galois, but has preoccupied Abel,
as Kronecker says. The problem is of the same kind as Diophantine equations, except that
here coefﬁcients are algebraic quantities (integers) belonging to an extended domain of
rationality. We have an entire function with integer coefﬁcients in the following equation
ˆ.g; f1; f2; : : : ; fn/ D 0
in which the f’s are symmetric functions and g a genus. On substitutes for those n C 1
quantities rational functions '0; '1; '2; : : : ; 'n in the equation
ˆ.'0; '1; '2; : : : ; 'n/ D 0
and thereby obtains an arithmetical formulation of the problem. Of course, the question is
the solubility of Diophantine equations of arbitrary degree, Kronecker hastens to explain,
but it is the general setting in arithmetical terms which is relevant. Diophantine equations
are also called indeterminate equations and involve unknowns which Gauss names “in-
determinatae”, whence the Gaussian heritage which Kronecker revendicates. For Galois,
it is the Galois ﬁeld, the smallest factorization ﬁeld (domain) for polynomials—which
is fundamental in the Kroneckerian context. As a polynomial can be factored into linear
factors by the group of permutations of the coefﬁcients, in the same manner one can order
the entire functions of a given genus according to the permutation group of generating
functions, so that one can arrive at a formulation like
rg.k/ D m0'
0
kg0 C m00'
00
k g00 C m000'
000
k g000
where the mi’s are integers, divisors of r, the 'i’s are entire functions with integer
coefﬁcients and g a genus function, that is a general function of the whole domain of
rationality. Such a formulation shows, after Kronecker, that all functions gi are reducible
to linear functions of the generic elements “Gattungselemente” of the fundamental domain
of rationality and the coefﬁcients of those linear functions are entire functions with rational
numbers as coefﬁcients.
Kronecker links his work on general arithmetic with his generalization of Sturm’s
theorem using the Jacobi-Hermite interpolation method for Sturm’s series where he
introduces entire functions of successive domains of rationality R; R0; R00 (Kronecker
1968a,b, I, pp. 305–348). Again, in this case, the goal is a general arithmetic or the
arithmetization of algebra, as he puts it his letter to Lipschitz mentioned above and

2.5
Kronecker and the Arithmetization of Algebra
21
Kronecker adds that it was a goal that he had wished to reach from the beginning. His
true “Jugendtraum” may be the arithmetization of algebra.
The second part of Kronecker’s main paper deals with the divisor theory of algebraic
quantities and also presents the general formulation of his programme in a sequence of
fundamental propositions. The theory of polynomial equations and their discriminants
ﬁnds here its fullest expression. The central concept is the concept of association of
quantitive formations “Grössengebilde” for the construction of general algebraic divisors
or moduli systems. Kronecker makes use of Kummer’s equivalence principle for classes of
ideal numbers and extends the principle to algebraic quantities without having to change
the theory of divisibility :
The conservation of these conceptual determinations in the transition from the rational to the
algebraic case was the incentive which has served me as the guiding principle in the treatment
of algebraic quantities.
(Kronecker 1968a,b, II, p. 327)
The general theory of elimination for polynomial equations proceeds along the lines of a
general arithmetic of rational functions with integer coefﬁcients and indeterminates. Forms
(polynomials) can contain “enthalten” other forms or be contained in other forms and two
forms are said to be “absolutely equivalent” when they contain each other. Deﬁnitions
of primitive, prime, irreducible forms follow. It is useful to quote in full proposition IX
(Kronecker 1886, p. 345):
When a homogeneous linear form F is contained in another form F0, the latter can be transformed in
the former provided that forms of the domain (of rationality) are substituted for the indeterminates
of F; those forms are linear if F0 is itself a linear form. In such a case the contained linear form F
is transformed into the containing form through a linear substitution with integral coefﬁcients and
this is a sufﬁcient condition for the containment “Enthalten-Sein” of F in F0.
Kronecker explains that the linear substitution refers to the indeterminates and the
integer coefﬁcients are the entire rational functions or integral quantities of the domain
of rationality R; R0; R00. Proposition X then ensues:
Equivalent homogeneous linear forms can be transformed one into the other through substitution
with integral coefﬁcients (ibid.).
Divisibility properties are easily deducible e.g. absolutely equivalent forms have the
same divisors and the ﬁnal conclusion is reached with the statement XIII (and XIIIı)
on the unique factorization of integral algebraic forms as products of irreducible (prime)
forms. What this shows, Kronecker maintains, is that the fundamental laws of ordinary
arithmetic are preserved in the encompassing sphere of algebraic quantities by the process
of association of algebraic forms.
The association of integral algebraic forms, Kronecker continues, is shown by the
result on unique factorization to conserve the conceptual determinations and the laws
(of arithmetic) in the extension of the rational to the algebraic; still further, it provides
the simplest apparatus, which is also necessary and sufﬁcient, capable to fully exhibit
the arithmetical properties of the most general algebraic quantities (Kronecker 1886,
p. 353). The association of forms is comparable to the association of imaginary numbers
in analysis, Kronecker contends, and shares the same necessity and the indeterminates

22

Arithmetization of Analysis and Algebra
involved in the process are totally in line with Gauss’s “indeterminatae” introduced
in his theory of quadratic forms. At the end, one could dispense with “irrational”
algebraic numbers, if it could be shown that they are algebraic after all, that is rational
approximations of a non-rational algebraic indeterminate number.
The programme of a general arithmetic has numerous ramiﬁcations, especially in the
theory of moduli systems where Kronecker constantly goes back to Gauss and Galois
as sources of his combinatorial ideas—in another tradition, of Dedekindian heritage,
modular systems are called polynomial ideals. It is Gauss’s congruence concept which
is at the origin of the general theory of modular systems and Galois’s permutation
group in the theory of polynomial equations—see the papers “Über einige Anwendungen
der Modulsystem auf elementare algebraische Fragen” and “Ein Fundamentalsatz der
allgemeinen Arithmetik” (Kronecker 1968a,b, II and III).
These results consolidate general arithmetic as an algorithmic theory of divisibility.
This is one of the major tasks that Kronecker has left to posterity from Hensel, Hurwitz
and Molk (1885) or König to Vandiver (1936), Weyl and Edwards. Hurwitz, for example,
shows how the Euclidean algorithm works in Kronecker’s theory of moduli systems while
Molk’s analysis offers a lengthy summary of Kronecker’s divisor theory. An interesting
example is Vandiver’s work on a “Constructive derivation of the decomposition-ﬁeld
of a polynomial” (Vandiver 1936). Building on Kronecker’s work and van der Waer-
den’s reworking, Vandiver obtains the decomposition ﬁeld by a ﬁnite algorithm for the
extraction of irreducible factors without the assumption of the beforehand existence
of the decomposition ﬁeld (or domain of rationality). Vandiver clearly confesses his
adhesion to Kronecker’s programme when he says that the method of moduli systems
with indeterminates is essential for the foundations of commutative algebra. Vandiver uses
induction, in fact the descent method, on a polynomial '.ˇ; z/ to obtain the decomposition
of a ﬁeld F.ˇ/. Edwards, another adherent to Kronecker’s programme, proceeds along the
same lines with his emphasis on natural rings of integers where there is a ﬁnite descent
method for the factorization of polynomials. Edwards (1989, p. 21) shows how one obtains
irreducible polynomials by assuming that if a polynomial h (an integral algebraic form,
“ganze algebraische Form” in Kronecker’s terminology) is not irreducible, then one can
suppose that there are polynomials of smaller degree than h ad inﬁnitum and with the same
properties as s, which is impossible, so that by a reductio ad absurdum we arrive in a “ﬁnite
number of steps” at an irreducible polynomial
h.x/ D b0xn C b1nnC1 C : : : C bn
in which the decreasing order of powers exhibit the ﬁnite descent from an arbitrary
integer n, the degree of the polynomial. This is, obviously, the essence of Kronecker’s
method. However, I think that Edward’s exposition is not entirely faithful to Kronecker’s
programme when he criticizes Weyl for having put the emphasis in his “Algebraic Theory
of Numbers” (1940) on unique factorization which was also the objective of Dedekind’s
theory of ideals. Edward’s argument rests on the fact that factorization depends on the
ambient ﬁeld, but one should add that one of Kronecker’s main results, on his own
admission as we have seen, is unique factorization of forms in the largest of ambient ﬁelds
or domains of rationality. Kronecker’s theory of general arithmetic encompasses the theory

23
of forms, their composition in terms of the association of forms and their decomposition
in terms of the theory of algebraic divisors or modular systems; it was undoubtedly
part and parcel of Kronecker’s programme to reach the most general result on unique
factorization for algebraic number ﬁelds—in Kronecker’s terminology again, in integral
algebraic forms. We have seen that Kronecker repeatedly insisted on the “generality” of
his general arithmetic.
Edwards (1989) also discusses Dedekind’s Prague theorem which generalizes Gauss’s
lemma to algebraic integers in relation to Kronecker’s earlier result on the theory of forms
of higher level (Kronecker 1968a,b, II, pp. 419–424). Gauss’s lemma says essentially in
one of its versions that two primitive polynomials have a product that is also primitive.
Kronecker’s generalization uses the Cauchy (convolution) product for polynomials
X

MhUk 
X

MmCiUiC1 D

k

where the M’s are integral forms and the U’s indeterminates so that the product

is “contained” in the resulting (primitive) form and the product can be expressed as
X
k
M0
kUk D .MkMmC1/k C .MkMmC1/k1 C .MkMmC1/k2 C : : : C .MkMmC1/
in the decreasing order of the degree k of the polynomial. This linear combination obtained
by the convolution product and the ﬁnite descent on powers shows simply that integral
algebraic forms “produce” integral algebraic forms, i.e. algebraic integers. What Edwards
ﬁnds so difﬁcult in Kronecker’s “terse style” is simply a generalization of Kronecker’s
1882 theory of forms which encompasses both the theory of moduli systems and the theory
of polynomials. The equivalence principle for forms stated in 1882 is extended to divisors.
The notion of content “Enthaltensein” is expressed thus : Fr is a form with indeterminates
Uhi which contains the product of forms where fi’s are entire functions of indeterminates
Uhi
Y

Kronecker refers explicitly to the content of primitive polynomials in his text, a remark
which leads immediately to Gauss’s lemma in its modern version “The product of two
primitive polynomials is primitive” (polynomials having the g.c.d. of their coefﬁcients).
As a matter of fact, Hurwitz (1895) obtained a proof of Kronecker’s theorem by using
Lagrange’s interpolation rather than Cauchy’s convolution and the Euclidean algorithm
which is also a form of the descent method—Hurwitz speaks of the elimination of
composite powers. Dedekind’s Prague Theorem which uses a form of descent is a

24

Arithmetization of Analysis and Algebra
consequence of Kronecker’s more general theorem on the product of forms. Again the
ring of polynomials is the proper arena (with the largest area!) for Kronecker’s general
arithmetic of forms and their divisors. Dedekind’s Prague theorem (1892) paradoxically
can be counted in Kronecker’s posterity—Kronecker died in 1891. I say paradoxically
since Kronecker has vividly polemicized with Dedekind and their methods were known at
the time to be divergent.
The immediate and long-term posterity of Kronecker’s programme includes a vast
number of people from Aldolf Hurwitz and Kurt Hensel to André Weil and Robert
Langlands. One should include in the list Brouwer, Poincaré and the French semi-
intuitionists like Borel and Lebesgue to a certain extent and even Hadamard, who like
Brouwer borrowed from Kronecker’s arithmetical theory of functions for the particular
purposes of topology—the winding number (which is an integer) or index giving the
number of times a closed curve C passes around a designated point P in the plane. Russian
constructivists like Markov, Shanin, Kolmogorov up to Essenine-Volpin have also some
share of Kronecker’s ﬁnitism. But it is certainly in algebraic geometry that Kronecker’s
heritage is most strongly felt. Weil (1976) considers Kronecker as the originator of modern
algebraic (arithmetic) geometry in the sense that Kronecker has initiated the work on the
arithmetic of elliptic functions—they have become the elliptic curves or the modular forms
of the contemporary scene. Elliptic curves even play a rôle in recent cryptography, for they
have an arithmetical content hidden under their surface of intersection!
On that count, Langland’s programme (1976) is consciously inspired by Kronecker
“Jugendtraum” which can be seen as an arithmetic theory at the interface of algebra and
analysis. It is still the arithmetical core which imports in that connection of the ﬁelds of
arithmetic, algebra and analysis, as Kronecker points out in his analysis of Dirichlet’s
theorem on the inﬁnity of primes in any arithmetic progression. Dirichlet was well aware,
Kronecker notes (1901, p. 482), of “the need for appropriate principle formulations of the
conditions under which transcendental connections involving indeterminate integers can
vanish”. Dirichlet was unable to further his investigations simply because he was blinded
by the overemployment of inﬁnite series for which there is no need beyond the formal
power series considered as a ﬁnite expression or a ﬁnite series, that is as a polynomial of
ﬁnite degree (Kronecker 1968a,b, III, p. 156). See also Lejeune-Dirichlet (1969) edited by
Kronecker.
It is decidedly the motto of the “ﬁnite number of steps” which is found in Hensel’s
introduction to Kronecker’s Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie (1901) that deﬁnes the
algorithmic or ﬁnitist stance in the foundations of mathematics. A number of logicians,
like many mathematicians, have adopted the motto, from Skolem and Goodstein to Nelson,
not to mention philosophers like Kaufmann or more importantly Wittgenstein (see Marion
1998). I contend that Hilbert was the ﬁrst to apply Kronecker’s programme, in a more
or less conscious fashion, to logic and that his own programme is the continuation of
Kronecker’s by other means. These other means are called “metamathematics”.

Chapter 3
Arithmetization of Logic
3.1
Hilbert after Kronecker
Hilbert is not the originator of the expression “metamathematics”, but he is the ﬁrst to
deﬁne it as the theory of formal systems designed to capture the internal logic (“inhaltliche
Logik”) of mathematics and it is the internal logic of arithmetic, what I call arithmetical
logic, that was to be his primary concern.
It is common knowledge that metamathematics—theory of formal systems or proof
theory—is concerned with ﬁnitary methods and requires a ﬁnitist approach in the sense of
Kronecker, as some early manuscripts of Hilbert seem to attest (see Hallett 1998).
The rather sketchy attempt at the simultaneous foundation of logic and arithmetic
(Hilbert 1905) puts forward the concept of homogeneous equations in a manner rem-
iniscent of Kronecker’s combinatorial theory of (homogeneous) polynomial equations.
Consistency, following Hilbert (1905) boils down to the homogeneous equation a D a
or inequation a ¤ a. At the time, according to the testimony of Bernays, Hilbert was
tempted to lay down his arms to the ﬁnitist Kronecker, whom he accused of dogmatism; but
under the threat of the paradoxes, he momentarily abandoned his foundational query, and
submitted to Kronecker in perpetuating the Kroneckerian tradition in number theory and
in algebra. It is only in 1918 that Hilbert resumed his foundational research and returned
to ﬁnitism, not without polemizing with Kronecker (posthumously!), Brouwer and Weyl
whom he considered as Kronecker’s direct heirs. The simultaneous foundation of logic
and arithmetic still dominates his preoccupations and the recourse to the notion of formal
system is meant as a mechanism (a ﬁnite algorithm) for the introduction of ideal elements.
My hypothesis is that this process mimicks Kronecker’s association of forms in his general
arithmetic and the consistency which is required for the association of ideal elements
can only be achieved by a formalism which is the exact counterpart of an arithmetic
(polynomial) algorithm, e.g. the method of descent as a generalized Euclidean algorithm.
The propositions of general arithmetic that are found in Kronecker’s “Grundzüge
einer arithmetischen Theorie der algebraischen Grössen” can be considered as so many
axioms from which Kronecker derived his results with arithmetical means alone. In

Arithmetization of Logic
his “Axiomatisches Denken” (1918), Hilbert pinpoints the properties of independence
and consistency as the main features of the axiomatic method. Relative consistency of
geometry and other scientiﬁc disciplines, Hilbert suggests, is based on the consistency of
arithmetic, but there is no further foundation for arithmetic and, Hilbert adds, set theory.
Logic is the ultimate foundation and it must also be axiomatized and in the ﬁnal analysis
there only remains for the axiomatic method the question of decidability which must be
settled “in a ﬁnite number of operations” (Hilbert 1935, III, p. 154). Here Hilbert gives
the example of the theory of algebraic invariants for which he had provided a ﬁniteness
proof inspired by the very method he had used in his major result (see Hilbert 1890 and
Hilbert 1893): Hilbert’s ﬁnite basis theorem depends heavily on Kronecker’s own methods
in general arithmetic and becomes the paradigm case for the decidability property of a
logical system! But there is no logic involved in Hilbert’s result and his paradigmatic
case is drawn from polynomial arithmetic (Kronecker’s general arithmetic of forms).
Decidability implies, of course, that we have an algorithm or a ﬁnite procedure to decide
of a given question in a “ﬁnite number of steps”. We then come back to our point of
departure and it is not surprising to see that foremost decidable theories are elementary
(ﬁrst-order) algebraic theories and have ended as the subject-matter of model theory, not
proof theory. The method of quantiﬁer elimination, for instance, is a test for decidability
and has been employed by Tarski in his well-known model-theoretic results; van den Dries
(1988) has stressed the inﬂuence of Kronecker’s methods in that context. But then what is
the logical point of the decision method? A decidable theory when consistent is ﬁnitely so.
In the speciﬁc case of the elementary theories, logic does not play any special rôle since
the equational calculus of polynomials does not need other operations than the purely
arithmetical (combinatorial) laws.
The case for logic rests solely on the alleged conservative extensions of arithmetic into
the transﬁnite domain of ideal elements. It remains though that even if Hilbert had hoped
for a logical introduction of ideal elements, he has constantly stressed that a ﬁnite process
(or procedure) is the inference engine of internal “innere” consistency.
Internal consistency is obtained by internal means in the case of general arithmetic
as in the case mentioned above of the theory of algebraic invariants. Hilbert was not
mistaken there and he saw consistency as internal to the polynomial equation calculus
when he deﬁned consistency as the equation a D a and inconsistency as a ¤ a. We have
observed that one of the essential tools of internal consistency is the convolution product
which generates linear polynomial expressions from linear polynomial expressions as in
Kronecker’s result, Dedekind’s Prague theorem or Hilbert’s work in invariant theory. The
convolution or Cauchy product can be called Cauchy diagonal. A serious blow to Hilbert’s
programme was given from the outside, the “external” Cantor diagonal in Gödel’s results.
The set-theoretic diagonalization does not belong to number theory or algebra, but to set-
theoretic arithmetic, as Hilbert himself has named it, but it is also set theory that he wanted
to secure in his proof theory. It is another paradoxical situation for the logician Hilbert to
see his full-blown programme for consistency of set theory and analysis put in jeopardy
by a set-theoretic device!
Kreisel has put the emphasis on modiﬁcations of Hilbert’s original programme; others,
Sieg, Feferman (1960) and Simpson among others have insisted on partial realizations
of Hilbert’s programme. Whatever the merits of the programme of Reverse Mathematics

3.1
Hilbert after Kronecker
27
(Friedman-Simpson), it is a posteriori and may serve only the limited goal of regressive
justiﬁcation. The Weyl-Feferman programme on the other side, or predicative mathematics
as an alternative to Hilbert’s programme, does not seem to recover as much mathematics
as Reverse Mathematics while sweeping too large for constructivist mathematics. The
objective of constructive foundations is not negative, it does not have to reject major
trends of mathematical practice, but only to enclose the safe haven of real mathematics,
in Kronecker’s words. A forward or progressive programme for logic and mathematics is
an attempt at extending the conservative domain without relinquishing the basic principles
of a foundational stance that need not be a philosophical refuge, nor a negativist attitude
against non-constructivist credos. And an incitation to revisionism is meant primarily as
an incentive to creative foundational work. Despite the moralizing overtones of many pro-
nouncements by Kronecker, one is reminded that he has been the target of numerous vin-
dictive attacks. Hilbert was not himself immune to polemics (nor Brouwer, for that matter).
A more balanced view would call for a reconciliation of Kronecker’s and Hilbert’s
programmes. New foundations for Hilbert’s programme invite to dig deeper in Hilbert’s
programme and to lay bare the roots of Hilbert’s metamathematical idea. Consistency and
decidability constitute the main avenues we have followed—independence being a minor
logical track for our purpose—and they appear already in Kronecker’s work in another
disguise. I have put these ideas together (with some others) in a consistency proof for
arithmetic which I claim to be Kroneckerian in spirit and at the same time compatible with
(a revised) Hilbert’s programme.
Hilbert hoped for a logic of arithmetic that would transgress ﬁnite arithmetic into
transﬁnite arithmetic; the logic of arithmetic would thus be transformed into an “external”
set-theoretic logic. The internalization of the logic of arithmetic goes the other way around
for it is the logical continuation of the arithmetization of analysis.
The nineteenth century was the century of arithmetization from Gauss and Cauchy
to Kronecker, Weierstrass and Dedekind, who conceived his theory of cuts as an arith-
metization of the real numbers. Even Cantor is interpreted in the arithmetic framework,
since some pretend that transﬁnite arithmetic belongs to an “extended” ﬁnitist programme,
forgetting that Cantor saw things “from the inside”, for example in his interpretation of the
concept of limit. Cauchy and Weierstrass introduced the concept of (ﬁnite) limit, the   ı
formalism, in order to approach “inﬁnitely” the ﬁnite; that is certainly the idea behind
Cauchy sequences (of rational numbers). For Cantor, it is not the process of approaching
the limit that counts, it is possession of the limit “beforehand”, as some sort of Platonic a
priori. Cantor’s normal form theorem, seldom discussed in that context, is only apparently
a ﬁnite descent for the second number class (the !-hierarchy) for ordinals that are all limit-
ordinals supposed to subsist independently of any approaching or approximation process.
Such a Jacob’s ladder never touches the ground!
The ground in question is arithmetic and its internal logic. But what is that logic, beyond
and above what Kronecker called the conceptual determinations “Begriffsbestimmungen”
or what Dedekind and Hilbert called “the laws of thought” inherent in arithmetic itself?
Frege asked the question “How far can one go in arithmetic by using only inferences?”
and his answer was that the inferential link consisted in transforming the concept of
succession in a series “Anordnung in einer Reihe” into the concept of logical consequence
“logische Folge” (Frege 1983). Sequences or consequences, one is tempted to say. Frege’s

28
3
Arithmetization of Logic
logic overpasses arithmetic in a theory of concepts that reaches for a Platonic world of
subsistent entities also inaccessible to mathematical practice, if not to philosophical and
theological—in Cantor’s case—speculation.
The internal logic of arithmetic consists simply of the arithmetical operations and the
laws that can be extracted from their combinations. The logic of the content emerges from
the content and is not superimposed on it. Formal logic, in the sense that Hilbert has
initiated, after Frege and Russell, is external to a logic of contents, but for Hilbert the
ﬁnitist conception of mathematics or proof theory (or the theory of formal systems) had
to stay close to the proper inferential structures of arithmetic while retaining classical
(Aristotelian, traditional or ordinary) logic, in particular its law of excluded middle.
Excluded middle is of course part of ﬁnitary reasoning, but is not an a priori principle,
it must be derived from the internal logic of arithmetic, for example, as the conclusion
of a descent procedure after a ﬁnite number of steps in a reductive process of inﬁnitely
proceeding sequences, where the principle does not apply following Brouwer.
Formal logic or a formal system with its axiomatic apparatus would then be nothing
else than the projection in the external world—the world “out there” of realists, platonists
and some structuralists—of the internal structure of arithmetic. I have named that internal
logic of arithmetic, arithmetical logic and its extension to Kronecker’s general arithmetic
of forms, polynomial logic. More recently, the name “modular logic” has seemed also
appropriate for a logic built on the model of modular arithmetic or the arithmetical
theory of modular systems in which congruence represents an equivalence relation
in a polynomial equational calculus. Herbrand and Gödel, among many others (e.g.
Goodstein) after Hilbert, have grounded logic on an equational calculus. All of these
logical developments take their source, in my opinion, in the ramiﬁcations of Kronecker’s
original programme. I say ramiﬁcation, for I do not want to give the impression that
everything was already in Kronecker. There are more things in “general arithmetic” than
Kronecker could ever dream of, but not as many as Dedekind or Cantor have wanted.
Dedekind hoped to go further in arithmetic with unrestricted inductive deﬁnitions and
Cantor still further with his normal form theorem for the second number class. But, as
Brouwer has objected, the second number class does not exist, it is only replete with
“indeterminate ordinals”. What we have called arithmetic continuation can go as far as
Kronecker’s general arithmetic and not into any transcendental realm where association of
forms becomes formless, as one is tempted to say after Kronecker. Arithmetic continuation
means rather arithmetization of algebra and it may be the notion of algebraic extension
which could best serve Kronecker’s original purpose. Extensions with a ﬁnite number of
indeterminates are isomorphic with polynomials in the ﬁeld (domain of rationality) of
algebraic integers, so that the notion of modular systems affords a “reductive” algebraic
theory, Kronecker’s general arithmetic.

Hilbert’s Arithmetization of Logic and the Epsilon Calculus
Hilbert introduced the epsilon calculus in 1920 to translate the quantiﬁer 9 and 8 and
replace the axiom of choice, according to Bourbaki in his Théorie des ensembles (Bourbaki
1970). But Hilbert’s deeper motive was a ﬁnitary reduction of the consistency problem for

arithmetic, Hilbert was prompted by the failure of the logicist programme to provide a
ﬁnitist foundation of arithmetic and eventually for analysis and set theory.
Hilbert’s intent in introducing the -symbol was to insure the passage from arithmetic
to the ideal elements of set theory (including analysis), that is to insure consistency
of inﬁnitary mathematics with the help of ﬁnitary arithmetic, the theory of (primitive
recursive) classical arithmetic. Hilbert devised the transﬁnite choice function to bridge the
gap between ﬁnite arithmetic and Cantor’s transﬁnite arithmetic (see Hilbert 1926). But
once the higher level of existence has been reached, one as to return or climb back to the
ﬁnite basis: this is the descent method “Methode der Zurückführung” (Hilbert and Bernays
1968–1970, p. 190) which consists of a construction “Aufbau” and its decomposition
“Abbau” in arithmetical terms. The whole problem of consistency is thus a matter of
recovering ﬁnite arithmetic through a process of elimination of the -symbol and the
critical formulas attached to it. To the question often asked “Why introduce the -symbol
if it is only to eliminate it afterwards?” the answer is simply: “To build up the ideal realm
and redescend to the (arithmetical) foundations in order to secure the whole ediﬁce of
mathematics”. Logic (and the axiomatic method) remains only a tool, insofar at it warrants
elementary arithmetical inferences and the truth of elementary arithmetical statements.
The ﬁrst axiom for the -symbol is
A.a/ ! A.xA.x//
where .A/ is a transﬁnite logical choice function (Hilbert 1926). The existential quantiﬁer
is deﬁned by
9xAx  A.xA.x//
and the universal quantiﬁer by
8xAx  A.x:A.x//
meaning that universal quantiﬁcation can be asserted if no counterexample can be found—
after a ﬁnite search, that is a ﬁnite iteration of the transﬁnite choice function.
Together with the Aristotelian axiom
8xAx ! A.a/
and the excluded middle principle
:8xAx ! 9x:A.x/
these axioms constitute the axiomatic framework for the symbol and its minimal character
could provide a passage from arithmetic to analysis and set theory with the rules of logic
being only an auxiliary means “Hilfsmittel” or even a deviation “Umweg”.

Arithmetization of Logic
The introduction of the -symbol requires two theorems on critical formulas and their
elimination: the ﬁrst -theorem eliminates critical formulas attached to a term t
A.t/ ! A.rA.r//
by a method of symbolic resolution
.R/ D

ˆˆ<
ˆˆ:
A.t1/ ! A.rA.r//

which reproduces the decomposition of polynomials since terms and expressions are
ordered according to degree and rank; the degree here is the maximal (ﬁnite) number
of terms in a sequence of -terms and the rank of an -expression is the maximal (ﬁnite)
number of expressions in a sequence of -expressions. As for polynomials, one obtains a
reduction to a disjunctive form of terms without the -symbol, that is a linear expression.
The second -theorem applies the same method to existential formulas and the identity
axiom. It is the induction schema which creates problems here and requires a new critical
formula
A.t/ ! rA.r/ ¤ t
0:
Substitution in this case is effected by means of number-names “Ziffer” or numerals for
the -terms and the method will induce a formulation of the principle of induction with the
help of the -symbol. The formulas
A.a/ ! xA.x/ ¤ a
0
and
a ¤ 0 ! ı.a/0 D a
for the existence of successors and their recursion give way to a new induction principle
which is stated:
For every numerical predicate P which applies to at least one number, there is a number
corresponding to P but for whose predecessor, if it exists at all, P is not applicable (1970 II, 87).
The principle is a direct consequence of the least number principle with the general
recursive function 
A.a/ ! .xA.x//;
and
A.x/ ! 9y.A.y/ ^ 8z.z < y:A.z///;

but the general procedure is reminiscent of polynomial decomposition in irreducible
factors, i.e. the Euclidean algorithm of the greatest common divisor and its generalization
by inﬁnite descent for polynomials of degree n or by the chain condition for polynomial
rings.
The substitution principle takes the form of global or partial substitutions and the
effective substitutions for terms will consist in ﬁnding the resolvent or the solution
polynomial in reducing substitutions of term instances to substitutions in fundamental
types of terms, i.e. terms that are not part of an other term. The process mimicks
Kronecker’s general theory of elimination and the consistency proof will lead to the
“irreducible” reduced formulas, as can be shown on the example of Ackermann’s
consistency proof for arithmetic—reproduced in the second edition of Hilbert and Bernays
(1968–1970, Supplement V, pp. 535–555). Ackermann’s proof relies essentially on the
reduction number of global substitutions “Gesamtersetzungen” for numerals and functions
using the machinery of recursive function theory: one ends up with a “normal sequence”
in a polynomial expression
n0  2h C n1  2h1 C : : : C nh1  2 C nh
for the numbers n substituting for terms. The reduction number has the value 1 or 0,
depending upon the global substitution being reduced to 0 or j ¤ 0. The total number
of global substitutions is 2n when the number of -terms (of rank) occurring in the series
of formulas is n, as is the case for the number of coefﬁcients in the binomial, for example.
For higher ranks, primitive recursive equations sufﬁce
 .1; n/ D 2n
 .m C 1; n/ D 2n'.m;n/   .m; n/:
The second -theorem has to do with the critical formulas of the second kind and the
symbolic resolution of existential formulas. The main idea is to eliminate the existential
quantiﬁer from formulas like
9r1 : : : 9rr8n1 : : : 8nsA.r1; : : : ; ns/
to obtain a disjunction

If an equality axiom is added, a pure predicate calculus without the -symbol can be
formulated and opens the way to an Herbrand-type consistency proof.
3.3
Herbrand’s Theorem
The elimination theory can be seen as a forerunner to Herbrand’s consistency theorem for
the predicate calculus. We give a brief treatment of Herbrand’s formulation. Let A be a
formula in prenex form, for instance
A  9x8y9z8tB.x; y; z; t/
with B quantiﬁer-free. Introduce two new function letters with f unary and g binary with
terms U1 : : : Un; W1 : : : Wn, then A is provable in predicate calculus in the form
A  B.U1; f.U1/; W1; g.U1; W1// _ : : : _ B.Un; f.Un/; Wn; g.Un; Wn//:
This disjunction, as the former one, is derivable in propositional calculus and may be used
as a criterion of refutability in a negative interpretation (see Hilbert and Bernays 1968–
1970, II, p. 170 ss).
The negation of A is
:A  8x9y8x9t:B.x; y; z; t/
or
:A  :B.x; f.x/; z; g.x; z//
and while Herbrand thought of propositional formulas as refutable in an inﬁnite or
indeﬁnite recursive domain “champ inﬁni”, Kreisel has introduced the no counterexample
interpretation as a functional interpretation of higher type: the type recursive functionals
are simply deﬁned by
Bx1:::xnŒF1.f1; : : : fn/; : : : Fm.F1; : : : Fn/
with B open. For a true formula A, we have
BŒF.f; g/; f.F.f; g//; G.F; g/; g.F.f; g//; G.f; g//
where the F’s and the G’s are obviously our new type recursive functionals (on this see
Cook and Urquhart 1993).
This last formula A is true if there is no counterexample of the form
:BŒx; f.x/; z; g.x; z/

3.4
Tarski’s Quantiﬁer Elimination

with f and g being arguments of the higher-type recursive functionals F and G  H; F and
G are continuous and may thus be linked with polynomials of arbitrary degree; we can
deﬁne the composition of F and G as

Since we cannot quantify over all such functionals—by diagonalization there is a recursive
functional which is distinct from all recursive functionals—we must restrict ourselves to
polynomials of ﬁnite degree and use descent on degrees and heights of polynomials to
recover a ﬁnitist version.
Let us remark that primitive recursive functions can be easily translated as polynomial
functions. It is obvious for initial constant functions; composition and recursion are treated
as the convolution product of functions G  H for G and H such as

Along with Hilbert’s idea of a terminating sequence of predecessors for a give n, Fermatian
descent allows for a ﬁnite reduction process in the guise of a decreasing linear order of
powers of a given polynomial.
3.4
Tarski’s Quantiﬁer Elimination
Another line of attack in Hilbert’s metamathematical programme was pursued by Tarski
and gave birth to model theory. Elimination of quantiﬁers led Tarski to the positive solution
of the decision problem for elementary algebra and geometry with the use of Sturm’s
Theorem (Tarski 1951). Artin and Schreier also used Sturm’s theorem in their 1927
construction of real ﬁelds, but it can be dispensed with and replaced by quadratic forms
(polynomials), as is shown by later proofs for the closure of real ﬁelds, the end result of
which is a disjunctive normal form (disjunction of conjunctions of atomic formulas), a
close relative to the Hilbert-Ackermann theorem (1928) for open theories, that is theories
whose non-logical axioms are formulas without quantiﬁers. Obviously, here is a meeting

34

Arithmetization of Logic
ground for proof theory and model theory—which evolved quite independently afterwards
under the auspices of the compactness theorem and Skolem’s functions. But to arrive at
the syntactic result, Tarski followed a route quite similar to Hilbert’s elimination theory.
The point of departure is a system of polynomials (see Tarski 1951, p. 31)

where E
k 	 means “there exist exactly k values of 	00” such that T.˚/ is an equivalent
quantiﬁer-free formula. The elimination procedure relies essentially on Sturm’s theorem
on the number of real roots of a polynomial between two arbitrary values F0.x/ and F1.x/
of the variable and reduces to an Euclidean algorithm for ﬁnding the greatest common
divisor of F0.x/ and F1.x/ in the counting of variations of sign in the given polynomial
(equation or inequality). Although Tarski mentions Kronecker and despite van den Dries’
suggestion that elimination theory has evolved in the wake of Kronecker (1988), Tarski
does not draw directly from Kronecker’s theory of forms (polynomials). Kronecker’s
general arithmetic of “algebraic quantities” is a theory of content of polynomials,
but Tarski will use a notion of content only in his theory of implication and logical
consequence. In that context, Sturm’s theorem appears as a special case of Kronecker’s
divisor theory. I shall outline in the next section a treatment of polynomials in the more
general setting of Kronecker together with Fermat’s inﬁnite descent, which is in fact a
generalization of Euclid’s algorithm. If Tarski concludes (1951, p. 53) that the decision
method amounts to a proof of consistency and completeness (for real closed ﬁelds, for
example), my aim is self-consistency of arithmetic and I review now Gödel’s idea of an
internal consistency proof as an extension of the ﬁnitist point of view.
3.5
Gödel’s Functional Interpretation
Gödel (1958) introduced functionals (recursive functions of higher types) over all ﬁ-
nite types as abstract objects beyond the (concrete) natural numbers. The Dialectica
interpretation has been extended by Spector, Howard and Kreisel and others in the
intuitionistic spirit of bar-induction and bar-recursion of ﬁnite type. Although Gödel was
animated by intuitionistic motives, his proof for Heyting arithmetic can be translated

3.5
Gödel’s Functional Interpretation
35
for Peano arithmetic where its constructive content can be carried over. I propose a
different approach to the consistency problem. Arithmetic here is not Peano arithmetic, but
Fermat (or Fermat-Kronecker) arithmetic with Fermat’s inﬁnite descent replacing Peano’s
induction and we have Kronecker’s indeterminates instead of functional variables. The
“general arithmetic” of polynomials (or forms, in Kronecker’s terminology) is built upon
“efﬁnite” (inﬁnitely proceeding, in Brouwerian terminology) sequences. Finite sequences
are sets and the Cauchy (convolution) product for polynomials is used as a mapping from
sequences to sequences in while the degree of a polynomial replaces the type of a formula,
the motive here being a formulas-as-polynomials interpretation.
Gödel states in a phrase reminiscent of Gentzen that the notion of accessibility
“Erreichbarkeit” is an abstract concept which requires a kind of reﬂection on ﬁnite
constructions. Such a notion is the notion of a computable functional of ﬁnite type over
the integers, which Gödel substitutes for the abstract notions of assertion and proof in
intuitionistic mathematics. Formulas like
F D 8x9yAŒx:y:z
and
G0 D 8w9vBŒw; v; u
will be used to obtain a consistent interpretation of Heyting’s arithmetic: for example, we
have
.F  G/0 D 8y; w9VZŒA.y; Z.yw/; x/  B.V.y/; w; u/
and
:.F/0 D 9y9NZ:A.y; NZ.y/; x/
where x, y, z and w are ﬁnite sequences of variables of arbitrary type, u is a sequence of
number variables while Y, V, Z and NZ are second-order variables—A and B are quantiﬁer-
free. Those generalized formulas (see Schoenﬁeld 1967, p. 218) constitute the functional
interpretation. Gödel deﬁnes the ﬁnite types inductively with the following three clauses:
1. 0 is a ﬁnite type (the type of integers)
2. if s and t are ﬁnite types, then s  t (their Cartesian product) is a ﬁnite type
3. if s and t are ﬁnite types, then s ! t is also a ﬁnite type.
Remark: the third clause means that there is a mapping from functionals of type s to
functionals of type t.
The last transformation raises questions of interpretation and the literature on the
subject is abundant, but I observe only that I translate this mapping as a convolution
product for polynomials. By the Curry-Howard isomorphism we can identify types and
formulas, in particular a product of types is identiﬁed to a conjunction of formulas. I extend

36

Arithmetization of Logic
the isomorphism by having implication identiﬁed to a power representation. Formulas can
be rendered in the following manner:
9x8x  9yBy D

and
8xAx  8yBy D

n
where Na0 stands for 1  a with integral coefﬁcients a and b and indeterminate x.
Combinatory logic is of no help in that context, since it fulﬁls only an abstract goal which
seems superﬂuous in arithmetic.
Such a rendering of formulas is in line with Hilbert’s arithmetization programme as we
shall presently see.
Hilbert had introduced the notion of a “disparate (mixed) system of functions” with the
explicit aim of producing a consistency proof for the pure predicate calculus (i.e. without
identity). The functions in question are simple arithmetic functions which associate a
numeral with a numerical expression in such a manner that for a given numerical symbol
“Ziffer” p and a disparate function system
'1; : : : ; 's;
the disjunction S.'/
p
is derivable in the propositional calculus. A disparate or mixed function
system is, for example (see Hilbert 1968–1970, II, p. 175)
'i.ni; : : : ; nr/ D  i
0   ni
1 : : :  nr
r
.i D 1; : : : ; s/
where the  i’s are the ﬁrst r C 1 primes. The idea is to associate, disparately, to
each r-tuple of numerical symbols a different numerical symbol. The procedure looks
like Brouwer’s choice sequences, as Hilbert remarks, and can be extended to inﬁnitely
proceeding sequences. This ﬁrst step in the arithmetization process must be completed
by an arithmetical imitation of the grammatical structure of logical formulas (1968–1970
II, 217) through a translation with the help of recursive functions and predicates. Gödel
achieved that kind of translation for the syntax of Peano arithmetic. We know that in
this case the arithmetization could not be completed, mainly because the induction over
an inﬁnite set of numbers lends itself to Cantor’s diagonalization procedure in contrast
to Cauchy’s diagonalization (the convolution product) which we can apply to Fermat-
Kronecker arithmetic.
It might be worthwhile to note that the potential inﬁnity of Brouwer’s choice sequences,
which Hilbert alludes to, allows for a treatment of the consistency problem compatible with
Hilbert’s programme. It is apparently in his attack on Cantor’s continuum problem (see
Hilbert and Bernays 1968–1970,II, p. 216) that Hilbert had the idea of arithmetization. The

3.5
Gödel’s Functional Interpretation
37
fact that the translation of transﬁnite arithmetic into ﬁnite arithmetic has not succeeded in
Hilbert’s hands is certainly one of the reasons for the success of the incompleteness results.
Hilbert’s programme however is not conﬁned to set-theoretic arithmetic in Hilbert’s own
terminology and I am tempted to say that the ideal of arithmetization survives for the very
reason that, as Hilbert confessed, the programme itself antedates Hilbert’s efforts and can
be traced back to Kronecker’s idea of arithmetization of algebra. Arithmetization of logic
is but a consequence of that original programme which was taken anew by E. Nelson’s
predicative arithmetic.
Robinson’s theory of arithmetic Q is consistent and essentially undecidable. But E.
Nelson’s proof for the self-consistency of Q in (Nelson 1987a,b) rests on a notion of
genetic, as opposed to formal, number which allows for a computable or polynomially
bounded exponentiation in the form
0.`; n/ D 9 f Exp Comp .`; n; f/
n D 0.n; n/:
The theorem on logical consistency says for a theory T:
T is tautologically consistent ! T is   consistent
and the inference
.b/ ! .Sb/
is genetic while exponentiation e.n/ does not imply 8n e.n/; exponentiation is not total
9n:'.n/
for ' D ey:
This is reminiscent of Herbrand’s arithmetic with induction on formulas without free
variables (quantiﬁer-free induction). Nelson’s proof is based upon the Hilbert-Ackermann
consistency proof for open theories (without quantiﬁers) which reduce to disjunctive
propositional formulas—as in Herbrand’s theorem—and they can be considered as de
facto or intrinsic polynomials. In Nelson’s genetic self-consistency proof for predicative
arithmetic, the numbers denoted by terms of the arithmetized theory are bounded by
the terms themselves (see Nelson 1987a,b, p. 176), while in the case of polynomialized
arithmetic, the numbers (the terms) are bounded by the degree (and the height) of the
translation polynomial. Bounded polynomial arithmetic would be an appropriate name
for such an arithmetic. If we look at primitive recursive arithmetic and add as in Hilbert
or Herbrand some restricted form of the least number principle (also found in Nelson),
we are coming close to an arithmetic which I call Fermat arithmetic, where the Peano’s
induction postulate is replaced by the method of inﬁnite descent, which is not equivalent
to (formal) inﬁnite induction from a constructive point of view: the equivalence requires
a double negation over an inﬁnite set of natural numbers, a procedure which is obviously
disallowed on constructivist (intuitionistic) grounds. Poincaré—who calls inﬁnite descent

38

Arithmetization of Logic
“rKecurrence”—and Peirce are two authors who have forcefully emphasized the distinction
for different reasons. The main reason to me is that inﬁnite descent embodies a central
method of proof in number theory. The method is employed negatively as reductio ad
absurdum, but also positively. Fermat, Euler, Lagrange, Legendre and Kummer all used
the method to prove important theorems in number theory. Nowadays, Mordell, Weil and
others use it in arithmetic (algebraic) geometry.
Hilbert acknowledges that Kronecker has succeeded in constructing a ﬁnitary theory
of algebraic numbers and of the ﬁeld of algebraic numbers, but he says that this theory
was to be found only in Kronecker’s lectures without mentioning that the major paper
of 1889 “Grundzüge einer arithmetischen Theorie der algebraischen Grössen” contains
certainly the main ingredients of the theory. Nevertheless, Hilbert does not misrepresent
Kronecker’s achievements and one can suppose that it is the same process of association
he has in mind when he wants to adjoin ideal elements to ﬁnite arithmetic, although he
seems to give credit to Kummer rather than to Kronecker (Hilbert 1926).
The ﬁnitist “stand”, “die ﬁnite Einstellung”, is certainly the heir of Kronecker’s
arithmetical constructivism, but the introduction of the -symbol and formal logic that one
eliminates to come back to the internal “inhaltliche” logic of arithmetic means that ﬁnite
arithmetic is self-consistent by construction: logical formulas are true by granting them
numerical content through numeral substitution in the method of return and polynomial
decomposition or descent reverses the process of construction into a process of reduction.
If the notion of predecessor is more structural or less internal than the notion of “smaller
than”, as Hilbert suggests, it is to preserve the axiomatic character of the least number
principle, but its true arithmetical nature is revealed in the ﬁnite process of the Fermatian
method of descent.
Formal logic for Hilbert has only an ancillary rôle, it only guarantees the passage
from arithmetic to its algebraic extensions through the adjunction of ideal elements
(indeterminates). But these ideal elements are algebraic in essence and Kronecker did not
need formal logic for his general arithmetic. From Kronecker, the negative transcendence
of non-algebraic extensions cannot be redeemed by indeterminate quantities (Kronecker
1882, p. 253). At this point, one is reminded of Steinitz who in his 1910 “Algebraische
Theorie der Körper” has “completed” the Kroneckerian theory of domains of rationality
integrating inﬁnite transcendent extensions (with an inﬁnite number of indeterminates also
called “transcendents”), but only by resorting to set-theoretic notions of well-order (the
axiom of choice and transﬁnite induction on ordinals). The continuation is no more of
Kronecker’s intent and Kronecker had warned (Kronecker 1882, p. 156) against inﬁnitary
procedures and had emphasized the fact that inﬁnite power series have an arithmetical
construction of their coefﬁcients and also that ﬁnite polynomial expressions dispense with
any extension of the concept of ﬁnite series.
The way back from extensions in the ideal realm meant for Hilbert that consistency of
analysis and set theory could be attained by ﬁnite means. But the reduction has also another
meaning for Kronecker: the theory of divisors or congruences in modular systems affords
a reductive theory of algebraic extensions under the isomorphism between extensions with
a ﬁnite number of indeterminates and polynomials in the ﬁeld (or rather domain of ratio-
nality) of algebraic numbers. It is that lesson which Hilbert seems to have remembered, at
least partially, in his ultimate ﬁnitist programme of the Grundlagen der Mathematik. But

3.6
Skolem and Brouwer
39
it is the algebraic closure of the theory of indeterminates (beneath the theory of real ﬁelds)
which limits upstream Hilbert’s programme whilst Gödel’s incompleteness results are only
a downstream obstacle that is not fatal to ﬁnitist foundations understood in Kroneckerian
terms.
3.6
Skolem and Brouwer
Skolem, like Herbrand, was an arithmetician and has conceived arithmetic as a recursive
procedure in terms of elementary operations indeﬁnitely iterated and he has defended
a ﬁnitist constructivist standpoint in the line of Kronecker (see Skolem 1970). He is
the ﬁrst to deﬁne primitive recursive functions without having recourse to quantiﬁers or
inﬁnite domains with quantiﬁcation over variables in the inﬁnite set of natural numbers.
Again, like Herbrand, he was inspired by intuitionistic or rather constructivist motives
and rejected the excluded middle principle beyond primitive recursive functions and into
general recursive functions admitting the least number principle with the  operator. The
functions of addition, multiplication and the relation of divisibility deﬁned as
D.a; b/ D
X
x.a D bx/
are limited to a ﬁnite domain of application, as in the case of the Euclidean algorithm for
the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple. Here Skolem devotes a long
development to the notion of prime number and to the deﬁnition of a least number for
which a certain proposition P is true without binding it to a universal quantiﬁcation on an
inﬁnite domain; such a proposition is always decidable for an arbitrary x in a ﬁnite domain.
This discussion reminds of Hilbert’s idea of the least number principle in his elimination
procedure of the epsilon symbol, but with Fermatian and Kroneckerian overtones on this
occasion, if one may say.
What Skolem calls a descriptive function is a function that does run on a ﬁnite set or
sequence of positive integers with the constructive deﬁnition (or description) of a given
integer n; the same goes for the concept of cardinality when one uses a ﬁnite function or
mapping to deﬁne a cardinal number of a ﬁnite class of elements and then generalize the
notion to an arbitrary class of objects. Skolem concludes by saying that he doubts of the
possibility of a justiﬁcation for the actual inﬁnite or the transﬁnite and he reiterates his
adhesion to a ﬁnitist standpoint in agreement with the Kroneckerian idea of determination
“Bestimmung” of mathematical concepts: such a determination, which one can identify
with an algorithm, is a process completed in a ﬁnite number of steps according to Hensel’s
characterization of Kronecker’s ﬁnitism.
Although Brouwer did not deal with arithmetic or number theory, his main interest
being analysis, he did contribute to the arithmetization of logic with his critique of the
excluded middle principle for inﬁnite sequences and non-constructive proofs in classical
analysis. He introduced the notion of choice sequences which constituted the foundations
of constructive analysis for which Bishop (1967) claimed numerical content (see below).

These are “negative” counter-principles or counter-examples, but they should not be
counted as improductive. The positive side has been used by Kolmogorov to distinguish
“true” mathematics from the (classical) mathematics of pseudo-truth, while Gödel intro-
duced his 1933 “negative” one-way translation of intuitionistic logic into classical logic in
order to insure its consistency:
1. P D ::P
2. .P ! Q/ D P ! Q

5. .P _ Q/ D :.:P ^ :Q
6. .8xPx/ D 8xPx
7. .9xPx/ D :9x:Px).
Gödel also recognized that Brouwer’s critique of classical logic and mathematics was
an incentive for his own Dialectica functional interpretation as an extension of the
ﬁnitist point of view. However it is certainly the Brouwerian procedure of associating
natural numbers as integral values to species (sets) and choice sequences as in the
fan theorem for ﬁnite sequences or the bar theorem—a constructive analogue of the
Peano’s induction postulate which has been an important moment in the arithmetization
process. Notwithstanding the real constructive content of those principles, il is clear
that they are important steps in the arithmetization of logic. Brouwer’s attempts at the
constructivization of analysis can certainly be seen as preparing Gödel’s arithmetization
of syntax, even though Gödel’s incompleteness results for Peano arithmetic cannot be
deemed as thoroughly constructive.
3.7
Gödel and Turing
Gödel has achieved the arithmetization of syntax following the steps of Hilbert and Russell
in the axiomatization of arithmetic. The arithmetic in question is Peano’s arithmetic—
the S2 formal system as we label it—and it involves the inﬁnite set of natural numbers

3.7
Gödel and Turing
41
with the cardinality @0 (see Gödel 1931 and Gödel 1967). His completeness result
for ﬁrst-order predicate logic was already couched in the model-theoretic language of
set-theoretical semantics with a denumerable universe. The representation of recursive
functions (primitive and general) and relations in Peano’s arithmetic led him to arithmetize
the logical syntax of the formal system with the help of a numbering (Gödel numbering)
which associates formulas to natural numbers. Using a diagonal argument à la Cantor,
Gödel could now construct an undecidable sentence in S2. The relation PrA..u/; y/ is
primitive recursive; Pr is represented in S2 by the wff Pr.x1; x2/ in the object language.
Take now the formula 8x2:Pr.x1; x2/ and k as r the Gödel number of that formula; by
substituting Nk to x1 in the formula, one obtains the closed formula or the sentence
8x2:Pr.Nk; x2/
()
which corresponds to the relation Pr..u/; y/. That formula says in reality that there is no
proof represented by the variable x2, of 8x2:Pr.Nk; x2/ and such a formula supposes the
ﬁxed-point theorem for the sentence k
`S2 k $ A.Nk/I
the formula A.k/ is obtained by substituting in A.x1/—which has x1 as its only variable—
the Gödel number of the sentence k to x1. The sentence k then says indirectly about itself
that it is true by the equivalence between the sentence and the formula expressing its Gödel
number. This leads to Gödel’s theorem (1931) which states that:
1. If S1 is consistent, then the wff ./ is not provable in S2.
The proof is simple: suppose that S2 is consistent and that 8x2:Pr.Nk; x2/. Take t as the
Gödel number of a proof of that wff in S2; we have then Pr.k; t/, hence `S2 Pr.Nk;Nt/. But
from 8x2:Pr.Nk; x2/, one gets E8(by elimination of the universal quantiﬁer) :Pr.Nk;Nt/.
Pr.Nk;Nt/ et :Pr.Nk;Nt/ are both provable, therefore contradiction (since we have supposed S2
to be consistent).
2. S2 is !-consistent, then the negation of ./ is not provable in S2.
Proof: !-consistency means that for any A.x/ and for all natural numbers n
`S2 A.Nn/ ! NnS29x:A.x/:
Let us suppose ﬁrst that : ./, that is
`S2 :8x2:Pr.Nk; x2/;
we have then
`S2 9x2 Pr.Nk; x2/;
()

42

Arithmetization of Logic
but by the consistency of S2, we have
°S2 :8x2:Pr.Nk; x2/
thus
8n.`S2 :Pr.Nk; Nn//
and by !-consistency of S2, this means that for all natural numbers n, n is not the Gödel
number of ./, consequently
°S2 9x2Pr.Nk; x2/
()
which contradicts ./.
The second incompleteness theorem or theorem on the consistency proofs asserts that
if S2 is consistent, the wff formula ConsS2 is not provable in S2, then °S2 ConsS2. As a
matter of fact, Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem supposes that
`S2 ConsS2 ! the wff ./
but is not provable as shown above, thus
`S2 ConsS2 ! the wff ./
is a false sentence. Otherwise, if S2 is inconsistent
`S2 ConsS2 ! the wff ./
is a true sentence, then
°S2 ConsS2:
Other results like Tarski’s theorem on the undeﬁnability of truth in S2 characterize Peano’s
theory as a set-theoretic arithmetic. But Turing gave a new turn to arithmetization of formal
systems by introducing the notion of computation as a mechanical process.
With Turing, arithmetization of logic entered the era of theoretical computer science
which has become in the words of Yuri Gurevich a challenge for logic itself (Gurevitch
1988). Gödel had praised Turing already in 1937 for the correct deﬁnition of computability
(as a mechanical procedure), but later on deplored that Turing’s machines put a limitation
on the transcendent powers of the human mind! In any case, Turing computability has to
do with ﬁnite procedures or algorithms and could certainly be considered as a natural (or
artiﬁcial!) extension of Kronecker’s ﬁnitism. Turing himself has attempted to overcome
the limitations of the incompleteness theorems by investigating ordinal logics which were
intended to pull back the transﬁnite ordinal machinery into the ﬁnite. Gurevich’s abstract
machines as ﬁnite state machines are an instance of drawing on bounded resources to

3.8
Arithmetic
43
produce dynamic structures capable of surmounting the limitations of classical logic.
In the same vein, Gurevich’s search for a logic of infons or information units indicates
that classical logic, or even intuitionististic logic, do not capture the internal structure
of information from a computer-theoretical point of view. From a different perspective,
ﬁnite model theory does not house the metalogical properties (completeness, Löwenheim-
Skolem, etc.) of classical ﬁrst-order logic since Trakhtenbrot’s theorem (1950) has shown
that the set of all ﬁnite structures or classes—due to the lack of a deﬁnite cardinality—is
not recursively enumerable, i.e. is not decidable.
The problem of computational complexity for decision problems has come to the
forefront and complexity classes range from polynomial time to exponential space
inside deterministic and non-deterministic Turing machines with the culmination in the
P D NP problem; is the non-polynomial reducible to the polynomial? The question is
still undecided, but it shows that the theory of algorithms and complexity theory have
taken up arithmetization beyond the ﬁeld of logic. Applied proof theory, programming
languages and proof veriﬁers (Coq, Agda) exhibit constructive features that tend to
demonstrate that ﬁnitism is gaining ground in the arithmetical foundations of mathematics.
Meanwhile, work on formal arithmetic, Peano arithmetic and its fragments or subtheories
and subsystems, has been going on.
3.8
Arithmetic
The study of fragments of Peano arithmetic (see Hájek and Pudlák 1993; Kaye 1991) is
relatively recent; for all practical purposes, it has taken over the study of subsystems of
analysis which has not given the expected fruits. Reductive proof theory for subsystems
of classical analysis aimed at reducing the consistency problem of classical analysis.
Reductive model theory may be the appropriate name for the consistency problem
of fragments of arithmetic. But here also consistency is a genetic problem, since the
consistency of a fragment depends on the consistency of the whole, i.e. Peano arithmetic.

Consistency in that context puts constraints on the length of proofs, their incompressibility
rate, if one is willing to speak the language of Kolmogorov-Chaitin algorithmic complexity
theory. In that connexion, logics without modus ponens (without the need of cut elimina-
tion) are conceivable that would reduce maximally the length of proofs in the spirit of
complexity theory (see Carbone and Semmes 1997). In the same direction, probabilistic
proof systems, interactive proof systems or zero-knowledge proofs (see Goldreich 1995),
all deﬁne effective computation in terms of effective bounds on the complexity of proofs
taking into account a randomization process that delivers pure validity of a proof without
further ado. Classical proof theory is then reduced to its bare essentials in the form of a
ﬁnite system, over and above the geometry of proofs which displays proof ﬁgures as spatial
(graphical) conﬁgurations with or without interaction. Geometry is still another possibility,
this time maybe without any player of the game, unlike current game theory.
In that context, Robinson arithmetic Q is an open theory with a ﬁnite set of axioms
and without Peano’s induction postulate, but it has the inﬁnite set of natural numbers as
its intended interpretation and is thus essentially undecidable. E. Nelson’s proof for the
consistency of Q rests on a notion of a genetic number, that is a non-formal number which
allows for a computable or polynomially bounded exponentiation in the form
0.I; n/ D 9 fExp Comp .1; n; f/
n D n.n; n/:
The theorem on (logical) consistency says for a theory T
T is tautologically consistent ! T is -consistent
and the inference
.b/ ! .Sb/
is genetic while exponentiation e.n/ does not imply 8n e .n/; exponentiation is not total
9n:'.n/
for ' D ey
and one goes back to Parikh’s theorem (1971) which states that total exponentiation
cannot be proven in bounded arithmetic. However, as Nelson notes, Parikh’s proof is not
constructive, since it is cast in a non-standard model (of Peano arithmetic) in which a
non-standard integer is called upon
8x9k.x < ˛k/
for a standard k
generating a submodel where bounded arithmetic is valid. The non-standard model hosts
also a non-standard y such that for B D ˛  k, one gets
9y.x  B/ 	 1  ˛k/ for y ¤ 0

46
3
Arithmetization of Logic
which is impossible. By way of consequence, Parikh’s theorem states for bounded
exponentiation r D xk that
8x9y'.x; y/ ! 8x9y 
 r.x/'.x; y/
and for Herbrand’s theorem, that we have a term t.x/ such that
8x9y'.x; y/ ! 8x9t.x/'.x; t.x//:
In the framework of feasible arithmetic introduced by Parikh, there is no proof of
Pk.A/ _ Pk.:A/
for P.A/ the smallest number of symbols corresponding to a (reasonable) feasible proof
of A for a sufﬁcient large k in Zermelo-Fraenkel axiomatic set theory. It is certainly
appropriate to recall here Poincaré’s critique of induction in the footsteps of Parikh’s
feasible arithmetic. The critique addresses the justiﬁcation of (formal) complete induction
grounded on another formal induction, that is by !-induction on all n
PŒA.N0/ _ PŒA.Nn/ ! PŒA.SNn/ ! PŒA.Nn C 1/:
By MP, it follows that
8xAx  8nPŒA.Nn/:
Bars mean that we have to do with numerals and formal equivalence is obtained in a
Gödelian fashion when one supposes that !-induction is a logical inference on 8xAx;
we are back to Nelson’s critique of unbounded induction, since inductive exponentiation
e.n/ is subjected to Gödel’s second incompleteness result, but the self-consistency of
Robinson’s arithmetic does not fall a prey to the predicament for the reason that the consis-
tency proof is bounded by the very terms of predicative arithmetic. Poincaré’s criticism is
further evidence for the link between the impredicativity of formal induction (or complete
induction) and MP inference for unbounded arithmetic. Poincaré, as a semi-intuitionist,
seems to have anticipated to some extent the rise of bounded predicative arithmetic.

 A. Notice that a well-
order is a well-founded order which is linear for a linear polynomial x such that x !
yx. Obviously, König’s lemma is inﬁnitary when we have quantiﬁcation over all ﬁnite
sequences of natural numbers; here an ordinal is the number of a transitive well-order
which is a well-founded linear order. To any initial segment corresponds an ordinal and
Zermelo’s theorem states that the class of all ordinals is well-ordered by 2 .

up to !1; this iterated exponentiation of linear order cannot be predicative and might be
inconsistent. But let us regress to our point of departure.
König’s lemma is akin to Brouwer’s bar-induction principle for lawless sequences
(well-founded species of ﬁnite sequences)

has been compared to transﬁnite induction on ordinals

but it has more import in association with Brouwer’s principle for numbers
8˛8xX.Na; x/ ! 8˛9x9y8ˇ. N˛x D Nˇx ! X.ˇ; y//
which means that if we have a procedure which allows for the determination of a natural
number x for any choice sequence ˛, then the same procedure allows for the determination
of a natural number y for any other choice sequence having the same initial segments; in
other words, the existence of a deﬁnite numerical value for an arbitrary choice sequence
implies that there is a continuous regular functional which can determine that value
X N˛x D X Nˇy:
The fan theorem looks more like a ﬁniteness theorem for choice sequences
8˛9xX.˛˛; x; ˛0; K/ ! 9y8˛9x8ˇ.˛ay D ˛aˇy ! X.˛ˇ; x; ˛0; k//
where X is a species (of properties),  a continuous functional, ˛ a choice sequence, x a

3. 9n9x.an ¤ 0 ! an  Ox ¤ 0/
4. 8n9z8x.an  Ox ¤ 0 ! x

The fourth clause is a ﬁniteness stipulation. The fan theorem is instrumental in Brouwer’s
proof of his fundamental theorem “any real-valued function deﬁned on the interval Œ1; 1
is uniformly continuous”—for all these notions, see Gauthier (2000).

3.9
Constructive Arithmetic and Analysis

It would be excessive to consider the various principles of intuitionistic arithmetic as
a formal bounded arithmetic, but its ﬁnitary inspiration is quite evident. It is not an easy
matter to trace a boundary line between the constructive and the non-constructive and
the extensions of the ﬁnitary viewpoint open up often with inﬁnite vistas on the non-
constructible.
Let us take, for example, induction on 0 bounded formulas (for fragments of
arithmetic) together with the following collection or replacement axiom

where 2jtjC1 is a ﬁnite polynomial bound. Fragments of arithmetic must be bounded
themselves in order to cope with the notion of ﬁnite computability central to bounded
arithmetic (see Buss 1986). Recursive function theory or classical recursion theory
are unable to capture elementary calculable functions without the concept of bounded
recursion. If Nelson’s predicative arithmetic is self-consistent, it is because the numbers
denoted by the terms of the arithmetic theory are bounded by the terms of the original
theory Q. Buss’ bounded arithmetic entertains two special functions
jxj D Œlog2.x C 1/
for the length of the binary representation of x and the diesis function
x#y D 2log xlog y
for logarithmic bounds.

Bounded arithmetic hoists also logarithmic and polynomial bounds for induction

1 LIND ; Pb
1 ˘IND or even Pb
1 LMIN for the least number principle which is dual
to Pb
1 ˘IND. The idea of a logarithmic induction enables the veriﬁcation of an inductive
property taking only polynomial time and this leads us again to (algorithmic) complexity
theory where the principal question is P D NP? i.e., is polynomial time (of a computation)
the same as non-deterministic polynomial time in which many actions take place in a
given state (of a Turing machine, for example)? Another problem is
NP D CO  NP‹
for the complement of NP. But here in analogy with the n hierarchy of fragments of
arithmetic, the hierarchy of polynomial time P; Pp
1; ˘ p
1 (between linear and exponential
time) does not collapse on a ﬁnite level, it is inﬁnite. Induction is once again the target and
it seems that in order to deal with inﬁnity, one has to bind down induction to ﬁnite descent,
the bound of inﬁnite or indeﬁnite descent.
Bishop (1967) has baptized “principle of logical omniscience” the generalized excluded
middle principle
8xP.x/ _ 9x:P.x/
which Brouwer was the ﬁrst to reject (only for inﬁnitely proceeding sequences, of
course). But the principle is clothed in different forms. For example, the relation of total
accessibility in a Kripkean semantics induces a principle of transit over all possible worlds.
At the other extreme, the concept of feasible number conﬁnes to a limited accessibility and
Sazonov’s (1995) principal axiom imposes the limit
8y.log2 log2 < 10/
and makes it impossible to transgress
2210 D 21024 D 1:
Compare this bound to the bound of superexponentiation in Nelson’s predicative arith-
metic (1986)

or to J. Mycielski’s theory of ﬁnite sets (Mycielski 1981) with the bound

3.10
Complexity
51
for constant c and a rational number p. In the last case, the notion of potential inﬁnity
plays an important rôle in set-theoretic semantics, but it doesn’t have any impact on
complexity theory where untractable problems concern computational feasibility rather
than decidability in a logical classical sense. Bounded linear logic (see Buss and Scott
1990) enjoys resource polynomials to take care of perishable goods (temporary data)!
Although not on a par with classical logic, theoretical computer science can display its
riches, but they are of limited applicability and negation by default lurks at the corner.
Greater danger lies in the deep: inﬁnitary classical logic and Peano arithmetic are but
superﬁcial symptoms of a science of the inﬁnite which Leibniz had dreamed of, but would
be actualized only in a model theory of ﬁnitely generated inﬁnitesimals (with compactness
and ultrapowers!).
The theory of series is the true arena of the inﬁnite and before Cauchy and Weierstrass
introduced the limiting ı concepts, inﬁnitesimal calculus had a light rein over the theory
of series. Here could be found the very foundations of the theoretical (or ideological) clash
between Cantor and Kronecker. Either one supposes that the limit of an inﬁnite series (e.g.
trigonometric series) actually exists, this is the case of Cantor who would say that it is
because we already possess the notion of limit as an irrational number that the limit of a
fundamental sequence
lim
v!1 av D b
exists while the limit process confers only potential existence; or someone like Kronecker
who would extract the arithmetical core, the polynomial support of the series (e.g. power
series) or someone like Brouwer after Kronecker who would insist that an inﬁnite sequence
is a process “ein Fortgangsprozess” in Kronecker’s words or “a process in becoming” “ein
Prozess im Werden” in Brouwer’s phrase. Cantor also believed that points at inﬁnity of
projective geometry really exist; nowadays, arithmetic geometry tends to eliminate them
without too much ado, i.e. Hermitian metrics. The gulf between the two attitudes is still
sensible in the distinction between Peano arithmetic (with inﬁnite induction) and Fermat
arithmetic (with inﬁnite descent).
The great American philosopher-mathematician C. S. Peirce who considered Fermat’s
method of inﬁnite descent as “the greatest feat of pure intellect ever performed” made
use of inﬁnite descent to distinguish between what he termed a numerable collection and
an innumerable collection in a way analogous to the distinction he had drawn using De
Morgan’s syllogism of transposed quantity between a ﬁnite and an inﬁnite collection.
However, Peirce would write to Cantor that Fermatian inference, as he called it, was not
equivalent to what was very improperly called “vollständige Induktion” in German.
We have observed that induction was the main target of a constructivist critique. Inﬁnite
descent can do the job of complete induction, even though it cannot be identiﬁed with it,
unless double negation is performed on an inﬁnite set as we indicate in Chap.4. Inﬁnite
descent ﬁnds a natural berth in the theory of forms (polynomials) and arithmetical or
polynomial logic aims at a radical reduction of logic to arithmetic. Formulas become
polynomials in the polynomial translation (see Gauthier 1998), but it is not a functional
(combinatorial or lambda) interpretation which is at stake here. Proof theory and abstract

52

Arithmetization of Logic
languages of programmation tend to be oblivious of the concrete advantages of effective
computation, a resource readily available in a polynomial calculus. A ﬁnite degree
polynomial is more easily subjected to a calculus than a theory of arbitrary types. Finite
recursiveness is steadily insured by the sum and product operations; composition (sub-
stitution and recursion) is embodied in the convolution Cauchy product for polynomials
and the -operator is replaced by inﬁnite descent. We see then that elementary recursive
function theory is absorbed by the theory of polynomials. So goes arithmetic.
Logical constants loose their “logicality” when translated into polynomial operations,
they do not loose their inferential power which a sequent calculus (or intelim rules) can
adequately reproduce. The very idea of a “Sequenzenkalkül” derives from the sequential
character of series and polynomials and the generalized arithmetic of polynomials is
apt to encompass the conceptual or logical ramiﬁcations of the notion of sequence and,
by the same token, of the notion of a consequence. The notion of logical consistency
with its propositional disjunctive expression (Herbrand and Hilbert-Ackermann theorems)
lends itself to arithmetical consistency. Molecular formulas are made up of monomials
and their evaluation is effected on atomic components (coefﬁcients), i.e. polynomial
compositionality is guaranteed by the evaluation map
1. O' (A) D 1
8A 2 DM
2. O' (: A) D 0
:8A 2 DM
8A … DM
where DM is an arithmetical domain which can be seen as a domain of rationality
in Kroneckerian terms. The valuation map is unique and is deﬁned for addition and
multiplication such that
O'.:.A ^ A//Œn D .1  a0x/
since .1  a0x/ C .1  a0x/ D 0 for A D 1 and the negation of an atomic formula A gives
O'.:A/Œn D .1  a0x/
where Œn is obtained by the assignment of a natural number to the formula A in the
arithmetical universe D. Logical validity is therefore reduced by the polynomial valuation
map to arithmetical existence and arithmetical consistency to :.0 D 1/ or 0 ¤ 1, which
we have shown to be the case for polynomial arithmetic. Classical validity in terms of truth
and falsity becomes superﬂuous in that context. Propositional disjunctions are transposed
into constant polynomials or, if one wishes, positive formulas are transformed into constant
polynomials and their negations into zero polynomials; all this amounts either to 0 ¤ 1
or 1 ¤ 0, where 1 is the degree of the zero polynomial, 0 the degree of constant
polynomials and 1 the degree of linear polynomials.
The total absorption of logic by polynomial arithmetic has an anti-Fregean or anti-
logicist ﬂavor. However, the fundamental motive of Frege’s entreprise was to translate
the notion of ordered series “Anordnung in einer Reihe” into the concept of logical
consequence “logische Folge” and we have seen that the missing link or the middle term
here is the notion of polynomial form. Frege’s original idea is not responsible for his ill-
fated logicism, it is the conceptual foundation of his formal system of arithmetic which is

3.10
Complexity
53
at stake and the comprehension axiom is faulty only because it has unlimited extent and
intent, as a critic could say. Internal logic stands in closer relationship to the mathematical
practice and does not allow for conceptual (metaphysical) foundations that divorce a
mathematical theory from its constructive content. Platonism does not inform us on our
practice, it is only an ideal account of intelligible structures. Structuralism itself need not
be the mundane version of a Platonic realm withdrawn from the actual construction of
mathematical objects whose objectivity cannot be detached from the creative subject, as
Brouwer would certainly claim.
Intuitionistic arithmetic has a privileged access to internal logic, for it is a theory of
content. The same could be said of polynomial arithmetic in Kronecker’s formulation
of the theory of forms. Tarski initially thought that logic was a theory of the content
of implication or logical consequence. Hilbert, Brouwer and Weyl have all emphasized
content over form. From the vantage viewpoint of internal logic, the whole of formal logic
appears as a surface phenomenon, a photographic developer which, despite its ancillary
function, plays an instrumental rôle in the foundations of mathematics. The concrete
combinatorial content of the arithmetic of polynomial logic singles out its internal logic
as a minimal logic for formalized logic. Pure predicate logic is the logical core Hilbert
wanted to retain, but for the needs of arithmetic it is easily translatable in the arithmetic
of polynomials and one could ﬁnally ask what, if any, is the place of logic in arithmetic?
Once again, formal logic occupies the same place as the “ideal elements” which would
only serve as a detour “Umweg” to be dispensed with when there is or could be a direct
route. The polynomial translation is that direct route in the internal logic of arithmetic and
inﬁnite or rather efﬁnite descent, in our terminology, together with the indeterminates of
the Kroneckerian theory of forms leads us back to our point of departure. It remains to be
seen if Kronecker’s and Hilbert’s legacy can testify for our “efﬁnitism”.

Kronecker’s Foundational Programme
in Contemporary Mathematics

Introduction
A few important mathematicians have emphasized Kronecker’s inﬂuence on contemporary
mathematics, among them, ﬁrst and foremost Weil (1976, 1979a) has stressed the fact that
Kronecker is the founder of modern algebraic geometry and Edwards (1987a,b, 1992)
after Weyl (1940) has insisted on Kronecker’s pioneering work in algebraic number
theory (divisor theory). Bishop (1970) has admitted in his work on the computational
(or numerical) content of classical analysis that his enterprise was more in line with
Kronecker than with Brouwer. Brouwer himself paid tribute to Kronecker—as did
Poincaré and Hadamard—for his contribution to the ﬁxed point theorems (see Gauthier
2009a). Poincaré for one among many others like Skolem or van der Waerden repeated
Hensel’s catch phrase in the Preface of Kronecker (1901) “a ﬁnite number of trials” (eine
endliche Anzahl von Versuchen) to characterize Kronecker’s ﬁnitist stand; Poincaré used
the phrase “ﬁnite number of hypotheses” (nombre ﬁni d’hypothèses) in his work on
the arithmetical properties of algebraic curves (Poincaré 1951) which was the starting
point of contemporary algebraic geometry, from Mordell to Weil and Faltings. I want to
concentrate in the following on contemporary algebraic-arithmetic geometry and the two
main programmes in the ﬁeld, Langlands’ programme and Grothendieck’s programme as
they are motivated to a large extent by Weil’s own work in algebraic geometry (see Weil
1979a,b,c). Both programmes invoke Kronecker’s dream of youth, his theory of forms
(homogeneous polynomials) and modular systems which consist in sums and products of
polynomials in a general divisor theory that was to become a theory of moduli spaces by
successive generalisations and enlargements. In my view, these programmes share some
measure of Kronecker’s arithmetical philosophy which sees arithmetic as the building
block of mathematics.

Kronecker’s Foundational Programme
The Kroneckerian point of view, as Grothendieck will emphasize, implies that function
ﬁelds are the analogue of number ﬁelds in the sense that an algebraic function ﬁeld in
one variable over the ﬁeld of rational numbers Q is an extension of ﬁnite degree of
the ring of polynomials in one indeterminate QŒx; function ﬁelds behave in QŒx as
algebraic number ﬁelds in Z, the ring of integers, while the ﬁeld of rational functions
is the ﬁeld of quotients QŒx of QŒx. Kronecker (1883) had sketched in his paper “On
the Theory of Higher-Level Forms” (Zur Theorie der Formen höherer Stufen) a notion
of content or inclusion (Enthalten-Sein) for forms or homogeneous polynomials with
sums and products of rational functions in a domain of rationality—Rationalitätsbereich
is the term used by Kronecker instead of Dedekind’s term Körper, corps in French and
ﬁeld in English (see Gauthier 2002). The notion of Enthalten-Sein or “being contained
in” is not perfectly clear in Kronecker (1882). Molk (1885) and Vandiver (1936) have
shown how to give a meaning to Kronecker’s construction. Molk had insisted on the
divisibility theory of polynomials and Vandiver has exhibited an explicit construction of
decomposition or devolution (as opposed to convolution) for polynomial ideals. I give
here a brief description (or reconstruction) of Kronecker’s construction of these higher-
level forms—Kronecker’s terminology is in various contexts Stufe, Rang, Ordnung or even
Dimension. Kronecker had outlined (1882) the most general setting for the decomposition
(Zerlegung) of polynomial content. I propose here my own interpretation in terms of
the convolution (Cauchy) product for polynomials. The general form of the convolution
product of two polynomials (forms) encloses (includes) or contains higher-order forms and
the substitution-elimination method enables one to remain within the conﬁnes of integral
forms. Let us start with the convolution or Cauchy product of two polynomials
f  g D .
X
m
fmxm/  .
X

with addition of their coefﬁcients m and n. In his major work, Kronecker (1882, p. 343)
states that a form M is contained in another form M0 when the coefﬁcients of the one are
contained in the second. He then goes on to formulate propositions on the equivalence of
forms like:
Linear homogeneous forms that are equivalent can be transformed into one another through
substitution with integer coefﬁcients.
(Proposition X in Kronecker 1882, p. 345.)
and
Two forms are absolutely equivalent, when they contain each other.
(Proposition X0 in Kronecker 1882, p. 351.)
Kronecker states then what he calls a principal result (Hauptresultat),
Every entire algebraic form in the sense of the absolute equivalence of Proposition X0 is
representable as a product of irreducible (prime) forms in a unique way.
(Proposition XIII0 in Kronecker 1882, p. 352.)

4.1
Introduction
57
Here Kronecker declares that this result shows that the association of entire algebraic
forms by the method of indeterminate coefﬁcients conserves the conceptual determinations
of the elementary laws (of arithmetic) in the passage from the rational domain or the
domain of entire rational functions to the domain of algebraic functions. But Kronecker is
not satisﬁed and comes back the following year (Kronecker 1883, p. 422) to the question
and introduces the product

the product of forms

which he maintains is still more general than the 1882 formulation. “To be contained” here
means only that the polynomials in the domains of rationality are included or contained
in a higher rank (order) of their coefﬁcients. A moduli system will then decompose
this construction into irreducible polynomials. Hence, the notions of inclusion and of
equivalence (reciprocal inclusion) of forms are valid generally, i.e. for both forms and
divisors and factor decomposition is a descending technique perfectly similar to the
division algorithm for integers or the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials. Dedekind’s
Prague Theorem is in the continuity of Kronecker’s construction; it says1 that if all
coefﬁcients of the product fg of two polynomials f and g (in one indeterminate) are
algebraic, then the product of any coefﬁcient of f and any coefﬁcient of g is an algebraic
integer.
For this unique decomposition of polynomials, descent is used to arrive at irreducible
polynomials, much in the same way as in Euclid’s proof of the divisibility of composite
numbers by primes. Now the fact (Gauss lemma) that the product of two primitive
polynomials (with the g.c.d. of their respective coefﬁcients D 1) is primitive can also be
had with inﬁnite descent and reductio ad absurdum. From this fact combined with the fact
that there is unique decomposition into irreducible (prime) polynomials, we obtain unique
prime factorization. Kronecker’s version of unique decomposition rests on the formula
quoted above

in the decreasing order of the rank k of the polynomial sum. This linear combination
obtained by the convolution product and the ﬁnite descent on powers shows simply that
integral rational forms generate integral algebraic forms, i.e. algebraic integers. What we
ﬁnd in the 1883 text is simply a generalisation of Kronecker’s 1882 theory of forms which
encompasses both the theory of modular systems and the theory of polynomials. The
equivalence principle for forms stated in 1882 is valid in full generality and the generalised
notion of content or being contained in (Enthalten-sein) shows that in the construction
(Bildung) of entire or integral functions the sphere of forms ﬁnds its fullest expression
(Kronecker 1883, p. 423). This is not to say that Kronecker has fully realized his dream,
only that he has conceived of an ambitious project that could possibly be fulﬁlled by a long
list of successors.
Kronecker (1883, p. 422) refers explicitly to his 1882 text for the narrower concept
of content in his text. As a matter of fact, Hurwitz (see 1932–1933, vol. 2, pp. 198–207)
obtained a proof of Kronecker’s theorem by using Lagrange’s interpolation (rather than
Cauchy’s convolution product) and the Euclidean algorithm which is also the original
form of the descent method—Hurwitz speaks of the elimination of composite powers.

4.2
Grothendieck’s Programme
59
Here again the ring of polynomials is the proper arena (with the largest area!) for
Kronecker’s general arithmetic of forms and their divisors. It is at this point that Dieudonné
(1974, vol. 1, p. 200) speaks of Kronecker’s old dream (vieux rêve) as being realized by
Grothendieck’s notion of scheme (schéma). It is of course Kronecker’s Jugendtraum that
Dieudonné evokes here and he describes Kronecker’s ambitious project as encompassing
both number theory and algebraic geometry in the polynomial theory of moduli systems
(see Dieudonné 1974, vol. 1, pp. 59–61). Kronecker’s forms or homogeneous polynomials
become algebraic varieties and his notion of level (Stufe) means dimension or codimension
in algebraic geometry—Kronecker’s dream of youth in that context is translated into
Hilbert’s 12th problem on the extension of Kronecker’s proposition on Abelian ﬁelds in
an arbitrary algebraic domain of rationality.
The decomposition process or division algorithm is thus a descent to irreducible
(linear) polynomials and Kronecker (1884, p. 336) in a later paper “On Some Uses of
Modular Systems in Elementary Algebraic Questions” (Über einige Anwendungen der
Modulsysteme auf elementare algebraische Fragen) makes it clear that his theory of higher
forms or moduli systems makes it unnecessary to have recourse to inﬁnite series as in
formal power series and that ﬁnite series, that is polynomials, sufﬁce or are up to the
task of extracting the arithmetic-algebraic content of general arithmetic, as Kronecker
says. The content in question amounts to substructures and extensions in model-theoretic
terms and the function ﬁeld appears then naturally as an extension of the number ﬁeld,
but Kronecker’s way was algorithmic in the combinatorial build-up of the hierarchy of
forms. As Edwards points out in his Divisor Theory (1987a), such extensions of ﬁnite
degree are not couched in an algebraic closed ﬁeld in modern usage and Kronecker
avoids the transﬁnite setting by simply introducing new algebraic numbers to Q in a ﬁnite
process of adjunction (see Gauthier 2002, Chap. 4 for details). Weil has insisted on the
deep connection between function ﬁelds and number ﬁelds without avoiding entirely the
transﬁnite construction and Grothendieck in his pursuit of Weil’s conjectures has enlarged
the geometric landscape with his notion of scheme.
4.2
Grothendieck’s Programme
In SGA 1, that is Séminaire de Géométrie algébrique du Bois-Marie of 1961, Grothendieck
and Raynaud (1971) starts his inquiry into what will be called Grothendieck’s programme
of the new foundation of algebraic geometry by taking a Kroneckerian point of view:
The present volume introduces the foundations of a theory of the fundamental group in algebraic
geometry from a “Kroneckerian” point of view which allows to deal on the same footing with an
algebraic variety (of current usage) and with the ring of integers over a number ﬁeld, for example.
This point of view is best expressed in the language of schemes [. . . ].
(my translation)
What we call today an algebraic variety (with a ﬁnite number of polynomials in a ﬁeld
K) was essentially a divisor system or a moduli system (Modulsystem) for the polynomial
ring in the hands of Kronecker; when it changes hands it becomes a locally ringed space

60

Kronecker’s Foundational Programme
in the functorial category-theoretic style of Grothendieck. Here functors transport arrows
(functions) and their objects by making room for the larger topological or toposical (topos-
theoretic) structures. I would call this approach structuralist as it is in line with the
Bourbaki School to contrast it with the constructivist approach of Kroneckerian ascent
and one could consider algebraic geometry à la Grothendieck as a tension between two
mother-structures, algebraic structures and topological structures, as deﬁned by Bourbaki.
Grothendieck (1960) in any case refers indifferently to descent techniques or construction
techniques in his 1958–1961 exposés in the Bourbaki Seminar. Algebraic geometry could
be seen more accurately as pulled between a purely arithmetical internal logic and an
external geometrical logic. I would put Langlands’ programme more on the side of
arithmetic geometry with Grothendieck’s programme on the other, geometric side of
algebraic geometry. In Langlands’ case as we shall see, the “principle of functoriality” puts
the emphasis on the correspondence between arithmetic objects and analytic data or a
deep relationship between algebra (groups) and analysis over the complex numbers, while
for Grothendieck the question is, is algebraic geometry more algebraic than geometric?
For example in Grothendieck’s theory of motives (motifs), correspondences are sought
between arithmetic objects and algebraic-geometric structures. One answer could be
found, I believe, in the massive work of Jacob Lurie (2009) on Higher Topos Theory.
Lurie’s work is certainly of Grothendieck’s lineage and I would like to concentrate my
short analysis of the matter in the chapter “Descent versus Hyperdescent” of Lurie’s
treatise.
4.3
Descent
Descent is a central topic in algebraic geometry. It is of course of arithmetic inspiration
having its origin in Fermat’s notion of inﬁnite or indeﬁnite descent. It has been practised
in number theory by Fermat, Euler, Gauss, Lagrange, Legendre, Dirichlet, Kummer and
Kronecker (see Kronecker 1901) and in modern times by Hilbert, Poincaré, Mordell,
Weil, Faltings, Serre and many others. Since I have explored inﬁnite descent extensively
elsewhere (see Gauthier 2002, 2010), I shall simply again quote André Weil’s version:
Inﬁnite descent à la Fermat depends ordinarily upon no more than the following simple observation,
if the product ˛ˇ of two ordinary integers (resp. two integers in an algebraic number-ﬁeld) is equal
to an m-th power, and if the g.c.d. of ˛ and ˇ can take its values only in a given ﬁnite set of integers
(resp. of ideals), then both ˛ and ˇ are m-th powers, up to factors which take their values only in
some assignable ﬁnite set. For ordinary integers this is obvious; it is so for algebraic number-ﬁelds
provided one takes for granted the ﬁniteness of the number of ideal-classes and Dirichlet’s theorem
about units. In the case of a quadratic number-ﬁeld Q.
p
N/, this can be replaced by equivalent
statements about binary quadratic forms of discriminant N.
(see Weil 1984, pp. 335–336)
For algebraic number theory, descent in Weil’s sense boils down via a height function
on integers m 	 2 to the ﬁnite quotient group A/mA of rational points of an Abelian
group A, which is then said to be ﬁnitely generated: this is the starting point of Galois
cohomology inaugurated by Weil. I would designate this form of inﬁnite descent as

4.3
Descent
61
a general Euclidean algorithm for divisor theory and Kronecker (1889) has used it
accordingly in his theory of modular systems where we have an extensive treatment of the
elimination or decomposition of forms into irreducible factors. For model theory, Tarski’s
theory of quantiﬁer elimination has its source in Kronecker’s elimination theory following
van den Dries (1988). For algebraic geometry (and Galois cohomology), it should be noted
that Kronecker had deﬁned a generalized Galois principle which consists essentially to
move from the group of substitutions for algebraic equations to the permutation group
of a higher invariant theory, that is for entire functions with integer coefﬁcients and n
indeterminates (see Kronecker 1968b, Chap. 11, pp. 284–285), these are the forms for
which Kronecker claims that it is the most complete arithmetical theory of algebraic
quantities (ibid, p. 377). His principal result quoted above, as Kronecker emphasizes, is
the analogue of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic for algebraic forms:
Any entire algebraic form is representable as a product of irreducible (prime) forms in a canonical
way.
(my translation of Kronecker 1968b, p. 352)
This amounts in contemporary elementary algebra to the fact that the domain F[x]
of polynomials is a principal ideal domain, a major ingredient of divisor theory. The
Noetherian chain condition on ideals is ascending and descending on the ﬁeld of F(x)
of rational functions. The direct method of calculating the g.c.d. here is the Euclidean
algorithm or in the more general algebraic-geometric situations, the descent method à
la Fermat described by Weil above and which I have characterized as a generalized
Euclidean algorithm. This is one of the junction points between number theory and
algebraic geometry that Weil (1979b) has stressed and it is here that Weil and Grothendieck
would agree, despite Weil’s reluctance to admit the category-theoretical language. Even
the recalcitrant Dieudonné who didn’t have much taste for constructive mathematics
had recognized that Grothendieck’s notion of scheme was genetically linked to the
Modulsysteme or moduli systems of Kronecker.
If classical inﬁnite descent relied on the well-ordering of the natural numbers to prove
impossibility results by reductio ad absurdum for example, it consisted also in reduction
procedures for Diophantine equations of ﬁnite degree with possibly inﬁnite solutions, a
kind of positive descent. It is also a kind of positive descent that Weil deﬁnes and Serre
as well as Grothendieck have named that descent “descending induction” or “recurrent
induction”—Poincaré preferred the term “récurrence” to “induction”. It is Weil again
who has introduced the practice of inﬁnite descent for ﬁeld extensions in the theory
of Galois cohomology. Cohomology as the computational dual of homology harbours
various devices and descent appears under many disguises such as spectral sequences,
exact sequences, descending sequences, recurrence hypothesis, ﬁniteness conditions, etc.
Noetherian rings and spaces have an intrinsic descent (chain) condition. Grothendieck
has even invented the term “dévissage” to express the unscrewing of the sequence of
integers inherent to the descent method. But in his categorical idiom, descent consists in
representing the algebraic structures—on a Noetherian frame most of the time—in the
geometric universe or universes by arrows pointing to the objects of the ground level
(the discrete topology), thus collecting the descent data from above and glueing them
below. This is more or less a pictorial or intuitive approach, as Giraud (1964) admits in his

62
4
Kronecker’s Foundational Programme
treatise on Grothendieck’s theory of descent. For a recent example of the use of descending
induction in a somewhat more constructive style, one should consult Serre’s paper (2009)
“How to use ﬁnite ﬁelds for problems concerning inﬁnite ﬁelds”, a most elegant illustration
of a simple descent technique. For an another illustration, Faltings had built his proof of the
Mordell conjecture—on the ﬁnite number of rational points of a rational algebraic curve
(of genus greater than one)—on moduli spaces which are geometric spaces endowed with
a Noetherian algebraic structure and ﬁnite coverings (see Faltings and Wüstholz 1984).
The method of descent still works by climbing down the ladder of natural numbers from a
given n or the sparser rungs of the prime numbers from a given p or l (for l-cohomology).
The same is true for the ring of integers and the ring of polynomials which are Noetherian,
as are ﬁnite ﬁelds. Geometric descent with functors and morphisms must count on the
algebraic-arithmetic descent to recover the ground ﬁeld or the polynomial ring which is
the fundamental arena of algebraic geometry. A nice illustration of this fact can be found
in Jacob Lurie’s voluminous Higher Topos Theory.
Inﬁnite categories or inﬁnity-categories (1-categories or !-categories) along with n-
categories are new objects of higher category theory and topos theory. For brevity’s sake,
let us say that n-categories for n ﬁnite become inﬁnite when n D 1. The same holds
for topoi and Grothendieck descent applies to n-topoi, where it is the usual descent à la
Fermat as introduced by Weil. Recall that Serre deﬁnes “descending induction” as acting
on two (positive) integers m and N with m > N descending to m D N (see Serre 2009,
p. 10). What happens in the case of inﬁnite topoi above and beyond cohomology and
cobordism for inﬁnite categories? The notion of cobordism was introduced by René Thom
in differential topology and was a starting point of cohomology and homotopy theories.
The situation becomes more complicated with hyperdescent, as Lurie admits (2009, p. 67)
and one has to introduce the set-theoretic machinery of transﬁnite iteration (induction)
on limit ordinals that reside in the universe of a regular uncountable cardinal; descent
consists then in a transﬁnite sequence of downward-closed subsets (ibid., p. 800) in order
to decompose them into pieces before glueing them in a suitable topological space. Lurie
does not refrain again from using higher set-theory with regular (inﬁnite) cardinals and
an uncountable cardinal in his 2012 treatise Higher Algebra for inﬁnity-categories (or
quasi-categories) and their descent machinery—see also André Joyal’s 2008 Notes on
quasi-categories. Even M. Makkai’s scheme of FOLDS, that is ﬁrst-order logic with
dependent choices has to use a descent (via the axiom of regularity) from the !-categories
it entertains in his type-theoretic categorical treatment of abstract sets—see his 2013 paper
“The theory of abstract sets based on ﬁrst-order logic with dependent choices”. In the
same Grothendieck’s lineage or line of thought, Voevodsky (2010) is proposing geometric
(non set-theoretic) univalent foundations for homotopy types—with equivalence classes
of continuous maps for paths between topological spaces—for an axiomatization in a
dependent type system à la Martin-Löf (intuitionnistic type theory). But he needs, as
he says “at least one unreacheable cardinal ˛” (ibid., 5), which means that one has to
climb the cumulative hierarchy of axiomatic set theory ZFC up to an inaccessible cardinal
before redescending to a topological space or to its fundamental groupoid–groupoids are
a generalization of the notion of group and they construct all morphisms as isomorphisms
in category theory by having a partial function instead of a binary operation between
group elements or objects. Here univalent logico-geometrical foundations might be seen

4.4
Langlands’ Programme
63
as multivalent transﬁnite arithmetical foundations! It is true that Grothendieck didn’t care
much about the cardinality of the universes of his U-topoi, the totality of which could be
called U-topia from a ﬁnitist point of view! But here we are a far cry from the Kroneckerian
point of departure of SGA 1, to say the least. The set-theoretic background (the category
of sets)—as a matter of fact the category of sets is reducible to a point in topoi theory
and contractible to a point in homotopy type theory—is the starting point of category
theory and topos theory, but the algebraic side of algebraic geometry ﬁnds its basic objects
in simplicial sets, that is ﬁnite series of ordinals. Here, I would put Quillen’s original
work in homotopical algebra with the Quillen-Sullivan rational homotopy theory in the
algebraic trend, while the geometric side exploits the ground territory of (homogeneous)
topological spaces with the full resources of higher set theory. Of course, one could accept
the logical, classical equivalence of arithmetic descent with transﬁnite induction, but from
a constructivist point of view, it can be shown that the equivalence does not hold since
it involves the excluded middle principle via a double negation over an inﬁnite set of
natural numbers (see Appendix 1 “La descente inﬁnie, l’induction transﬁnie et le tiers
exclu” of Gauthier 2010, pp. 133–151, and also Gauthier 2002, p. 51). Let us note that
higher topoi theory, not unlike ordinary (lower) topoi theory, makes room for Heyting
topoi where a second-order intuitionistic logic leaves no place for the classical excluded
middle principle. The arithmetic scope of arithmetic-algebraic geometry appears to be
more faithful to its Kroneckerian inspiration and I want to look brieﬂy at Langlands
programme in that perspective.
4.4
Langlands’ Programme
In his paper on contemporary problems with origins in Kronecker’s Jugendtraum Lang-
lands (1976) evokes Hibert’s 12th problem in the 1900 list which reads “Extension
of Kronecker’s proposition on Abelian ﬁelds over an arbitrary algebraic domain of
rationality”. Hilbert declares that it is one of the deepest and far-reaching problems of
number theory and function theory to generalize Kronecker’s proposition on the generation
of every commutative (Abelian) rational ﬁeld through the decomposition of ﬁelds for the
roots of unity; the idea here is to extend the rational ﬁeld to any algebraic number ﬁeld—
what is called today the Kronecker-Weber theorem asserts that any Abelian extension of
Q belongs to the cyclotomic ﬁeld Q.m/. Hilbert holds the problem to be at the internal
junction of number theory, algebra and the theory of functions (analysis). Such a language
recalls Kronecker’s statement in his inaugural speech at the Berlin Academy of Science in
the year 1861 (see Kronecker 1968a, vol. V, p. 388):
[. . . ] the study of complex multiplication of elliptic functions leading to works the object of which
can be characterized as being drawn from analysis, motivated by algebra and driven by number
theory.

Kronecker’s Foundational Programme
Kronecker was perfectly aware of the centrality of his programme which he sees in
the continuity of Gauss and Dirichlet and there is no doubt that he hoped for a full
arithmetization of analysis. The dream of his youth (Jugendtraum) was that vision of
an arithmetical theory of elliptic functions, an arithmetic of ellipotomy or divison of
the ellipse, as I venture to say in analogy with the notion of cyclotomy. In a letter to
Dedekind, Kronecker goes even as far as to say that the fundamental relation he has found
between arithmetic and analysis originates in a philosophical intuition (see Kronecker
1899, vol. V, p. 453). Kronecker’s foundational insight is given its fullest expression in
his main paper on the arithmetical theory of algebraic quantities of 1882 where he gives
the ﬁnal formulation of his Allgemeine Arithmetik or General Arithmetic. It contains,
in Kronecker’s words, the complete development of the theory of entire (rational and
algebraic) functions of a variable together with the systems of divisors. In such a complete
theory, the association of forms allows for the conservation of the laws of factorization, so
that the passage from natural and rational domains to the more general algebraic domains
(of algebraic integers) is perfectly uniform. The conservative extension of arithmetic up to
the highest reaches of algebra—the theory of entire rational and algebraic functions—is
the ultimate goal of general arithmetic deﬁned as the theory of all forms, homogeneous
polynomials with integer coefﬁcients and an arbitrary number of indeterminates.
Langlands insists also on number theory in connection with algebraic geometry, as Weil
has taught. Here Langlands points to the continuation of Kronecker’s work on Abelian
extensions by the generalization to Abelian varieties in the hands of a long offspring of
number theorists from Hilbert to Shimura and Deligne. For example, Shimura varieties
embody some ideas of Kronecker who sought arithmetic objects within the analytic core
of elliptic curves which are supported by polynomials of degree 3 over Q and extended to
R and C. Abelian varieties are nowadays spread out over algebraic number ﬁelds, ﬁnite
ﬁelds, local ﬁelds and extend to contemporary arithmetic algebraic geometry in the work
of Faltings and Wiles—by the way, descent is still present in the proof of Fermat’s last
theorem, if it is only by the Noetherian ring on the sequence of primes, modular and
automorphic forms being on their side generalizations of Kronecker’s moduli systems;
moreover Wiles’ (and Tailor’s) proof rests on an Euler system of primes, the arithmetic
bone structure of Riemann zeta function.
Langlands’ programme or Langlands’ philosophy, as it has come to be known, could be
seen as a contemporary revival of Kronecker’s idea of the deep analogy or correspondence
between number ﬁelds and function ﬁelds. Evidently, as I mentioned above, the contem-
porary mathematician will not refrain from transcendental methods, but when he comes
down to the arithmetic level, he sticks as the typical arithmetician would say, to the motto
“denumerable at inﬁnity”, which means that denumerable inﬁnity is seen as a limit or
that the non-denumerable is unknown territory (terra incognita). Langlands’ philosophy
has met with success in two recent instances, Lafforgue’s and Ngô’s contributions to
Langlands’ programme. I want to deal brieﬂy with Laurent Lafforgue’s result.
Lafforgue (2002) has succeeded in showing the exact Langlands’ correspondence
between pieces of the modular space (or algebraic variety) and its (denumerable) rational
points with the help of an iteration technique on Drinfel’d chtoukas—chtoukas comes
from the Russian < штука > and is drawn from the German Stücke, meaning pieces.
The ground ﬁeld of Langlands’ correspondence is a ﬁnite ﬁeld F with a Galois group

G and we come back to the priviledged arena of applications for Fermat’s descent on
Weil’s conception. I’ll not pursue that theme, but only recall that Drinfel’d himself has
drawn on some motives from Kronecker, his chtoukas are elliptic moduli and have an
ancestral relationship to Kronecker’s search for arithmetic objects or “discrete pieces” in
the complex multiplication of elliptic functions.
Kronecker’s dream and programme of a general arithmetic have provided a fertile soil
for large-scale foundational projects, if only as deep-seated motivations or inspirational
ideas. The immediate and long-term posterity of Kronecker’s programme includes a
vast number of people from Hurwitz and Hensel to Weil and Langlands. One should
include in the list Brouwer, Poincaré and the French semi-intuitionists like Borel and
Lebesgue to a certain extent and even Hadamard, who did borrow from Kronecker’s
arithmetical theory of functions for the particular purposes of topology e.g. the winding
number (Windungszahl) which is an integer or index giving the number of times a closed
curve c passes around a designated point P in the plane or in contemporary idiom the
topological degree for a continuous function to itself on the closed unit ball Dn. Russian
constructivists like Markov, Shanin, Kolmogorov up to Essenine-Volpin have also some
share of Kronecker’s ﬁnitism. But it is certainly in algebraic geometry that Kronecker’s
heritage is most strongly felt. Weil (1976) considers Kronecker as the originator of modern
algebraic (arithmetic) geometry in the sense that Kronecker has initiated the work on the
arithmetic of elliptic functions—they have become the elliptic curves or the modular forms
of the contemporary scene. Arithmetic elliptic curves are the central target of the Shimura-
Taniyama-Weil conjecture that led to the proof of Fermat’s last theorem. Wiles and Taylor
solved the semi-stable case and Breuil, Conrad, Diamond and Taylor ﬁnally proved the
full conjecture. The calculations needed for the proof along with Faltings’ result on the
ﬁniteness of rational points on an elliptic curve (the Mordell conjecture) are a testimony to
the ﬁniteness results in the rational number ﬁeld Q in the tradition of Fermat-Kronecker-
Weil arithmetic, the F-K-W arithmetical tradition, as I may encapsulate it.
4.5
Kronecker’s and Hilbert’s Programmes in Contemporary
Mathematical Logic
I see Hilbert’s metamathematical programme as the continuation of Kronecker’s arithmeti-
cal programme with other means, that is the means of logic. In turn, I consider Hilbert’s
theory of formal systems and axiomatization as the initiation of the arithmetization of
logic after Kronecker’s arithmetization programme. Such an arithmetization of logic is
manifest in contemporary theoretical computer science and in applied proof theory. I want
to emphasize the new developments in Hilbert’s proof-theoretical programme.
It is common knowledge that metamathematics or proof theory is concerned with
ﬁnitary methods, as in Hilbert’s conception of the theory of formal systems. I contend
(see Gauthier 1989, 1991, 1994, 2002) that the consistency question is the crux of the
matter and that it requires a ﬁnistist approach in the sense of Kronecker, as some Hilbert’s
early manuscripts seem to attest—see Sieg (1999) for Hilbert’s later papers. The rather

66

Kronecker’s Foundational Programme
sketchy attempt on the simultaneous foundation of logic and arithmetic (Hilbert 1905) puts
forward the concept of homogeneous equations in a manner reminiscent of Kronecker’s
combinatorial theory of homogeneous polynomials. Consistency, following Hilbert boils
down to the homogeneous equation a D a or inequation a ¤ a. In his report on Hilbert’s
research on the foundations of arithmetic, Bernays says that Hilbert, in spite of his durable
opposition to Kronecker whom he accused of dogmatism, has wanted a reconciliation with
Kronecker’s ﬁnitist stand:
Kronecker has elaborated a clear conception which he has put to use in many cases and his
conception accords essentially with our ﬁnitist position
(see Hilbert 1935, vol. III, p. 203, my translation).
The quotation refers to Hilbert (1930) on the foundations of elementary number theory
and is a sequel to Hilbert’s paper “Über das Unendliche” (1926). The ﬁnitist position in
question is the metamathematical idea of proof theory which I would formulate in the
following way, To use ﬁnite logical rules with transﬁnite axioms in order to extend the
ﬁnite into the inﬁnite. The metamathematical conception is modeled after Kronecker’s
extension of elementary arithmetic into general arithmetic, an extension which should
preserve the conceptual determinations of elementary arithmetic, following Kronecker;
for Hilbert, the objective was to preserve the laws of ﬁnite logic with the excluded middle
principle in the transﬁnite (set-theoretic) realm of ideal elements (ideale Elemente) for
which classical (Aristotelian) logic could not make place because it did not distinguish
between the ﬁnite and the transﬁnite—Kronecker could respond to Hilbert here by saying
that there was no actual inﬁnite in Aristotelian logic either, but only a potential inﬁnite for
Aristotle and Euclid. Logic will provide the passage from the ﬁnite to the inﬁnite, since
there is no place for the inﬁnite (Hilbert 1930, p. 487) as it was also proclaimed in the
lecture “On the Inﬁnite”. From my point of view, Hilbert’s metamathematical programme
is but the continuation or the consequence of Kronecker’s arithmetization programme.
A further proof of Kronecker’s inspiration, if not direct inﬂuence, on Hilbert’s proof
theory is the introduction by Hilbert of the ﬁnite-type functionals in his (unsuccessful)
attempt to prove Cantor’s continuum hypothesis in his 1926 paper “On the Inﬁnite” (see
Hilbert 1926)). As Kohlenbach notes (2008a,b) those ﬁnite-type functionals were used
by Gödel (1958) in his Dialectica interpretation for the consistency of intuitionistic
arithmetic and it is an essential tool (with Herbrand’s theorem) for applied proof theory
(see Gauthier 2009a); it must be added here that Gödel had already referred to Hilbert’s
construction in his 1931 paper on completeness and consistency (cf. Über Vollständigkeit
und Widerspruchsfreiheit. Ergebnisse eines mathematischen Kolloquiums 3 (1932, p. 13))
where he imagines a transﬁnite sequence of formal systems of higher type. Let us remark
though that in his proof for the consistency of intuitionnistic arithmetic (the Dialectica
interpretation), Gödel limits his (impredicative) construction to all ﬁnite types up to !.
Hilbert’s idea was to introduce number-theoretic functions “as those functions of an
integral argument whose values are also integers” and then add up functions of functions,
functions of functions of functions in a ﬁnite procedure for the iteration of types of
functional variables over primitive integral types. Those higher-type functionals according
to their height are associated with propositions that are supposed to come into a one-to-one
correspondence with the transﬁnite ordinals up to the 0 of Cantor’s second number class.

4.5
Kronecker’s and Hilbert’s Programmes
67
Hilbert needed transﬁnite induction here, but since only a ﬁnite iteration was necessary
for the build-up of the functional hierarchy, the methods of substitution and recursion
would sufﬁce to produce a ﬁnitary proof, because substitution and recursion are counted
as ﬁnitary procedures according to Hilbert. Hilbert’s course, I forcibly suggest, follows
up or reproduces Kronecker’s construction of higher-level (Stufe) or (Rang) forms or
homogeneous polynomials in his 1883 paper (Kronecker 1883) where substitution and
decomposition—or descent for recursion—were used in a radical ﬁnitist setting, as I have
shown above. Kronecker’s idea was to build a ﬁnite hierarchy of (polynomial) functions
to encompass the content of general arithmetic, what he calls the multilevel extension
domain of arithmetic (stufenweise Gebietserweiterung der Arithmetik) in the footsteps of
Gauss (Kronecker 1889, p. 356). Beyond and above this—and despite his repeated ﬁnitist
commitment (ﬁnite Einstellung)—Hilbert wanted to include Cantor’s transﬁnite arithmetic
(up to 0).
lim
n!! !!:::! 
n D 0:
One step further and the ordinal rank structure of von Neumann or the cumulative rank
structure of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory would look like transcendental extensions of
Kronecker’s ﬁnite arithmetical rank construction! In this line of thought, one could follow
the thread of the classical identiﬁcation of inﬁnite descent with transﬁnite induction and
go a long way with the axiom of foundation into von Neumanns universe of classes having
transitive sets playing the rôle of inner models in Gödel’s constructible universe (with the
axiom V D L). And still going into Cohen’s generic extensions of the forcing method as
analogues of Kronecker’s ﬁnite ﬁeld extensions with indeterminates, one ends up in an
idealized—or realized in a Platonic or Cantorian paradise—version of Fermat-Kronecker
arithmetic. It is no wonder that Gödel’s and Cohen’s results for the axiom of choice and
the continuum hypothesis could not be contained within Z-F axiomatic set theory, realizing
their independence in the free spirit of transﬁnite ideal arithmetic, which could be called
transcendental arithmetic, not to be confused with transcendental number theory.
Hilbert took a more direct course by following faithfully the Kroneckerian construction
I have outlined above in using the two fundamental procedures of substitution (for new
variables) and recursion (Rekursion) where the values of a function of height n C 1 are
derived from the values of a function of height n (Hilbert 1926, p. 184). Kronecker had
instead polynomials of order n generating a system of order n C 1 by the product operation
(Kronecker 1883, p. 419).
Hilbert’s attempt failed, but the construction was pursued by Hilbert’s followers like
Gentzen, Ackermann (1940), Kalmár—with the inﬁnite descent idea—and Gödel in
allegedly extended ﬁnitist ways—see my critique in Gauthier (2002, pp. 57–58) where
I insist that transﬁnite induction with an (excluding third) double negation on the inﬁnite
set of natural numbers cannot be identiﬁed with inﬁnite descent from a constructive ﬁnitist
point of view. Gödel did not use transﬁnite induction in his Dialectica interpretation, but
induction on all ﬁnite types and I contend that the functional interpretation has a natural
translation in the polynomial arithmetic of Kronecker’s theory of higher-level forms (see
Gauthier 2002, pp. 74–76).

Kronecker’s Foundational Programme
Herbrand (see 1968, p. 152), a follower of Hilbert, wanted also a consistency proof for
arithmetic and he had formulated what I call Herbrand conjecture (see Gauthier 1983a),
Transcendental methods cannot demonstrate theorems in arithmetic that could not be demonstrated
by arithmetical means alone.
(my tranlation)
Herbrand stated his conjecture for a suitable formal system which he does not describe.
Herbrand was also a practitioner of (algebraic) number theory and he expressed himself in
Kroneckerian terms when he used what he called “intuitionistic” arguments where one
supposes that an object, logical or mathematical, does not exist without the means to
construct it. In the same line of thought, he defends the potential inﬁnite for his notion
of inﬁnite domain (champ inﬁni) by saying that it is built iteratively (pas-à-pas) or (Schritt
zu Schritt) in Kroneckerian terms, an expression also used by Skolem. Herbrand worked
for instance on extensions (ﬁnite and inﬁnite) of ﬁnite ﬁelds in the tradition of Hilbert and
Kronecker, foreshadowing to some extent the contemporary work of Weil and Serre.
4.6
Conclusion: Finitism and Arithmetism
<Arithmetism> is the name I give to a foundational option in radical opposition to
logicism and to Frege’s question (1983, X), “How far can one go in arithmetic solely
by deductive (logical) means?” (Wie weit man in der Arithmetik durch Schlüsse allein
gelangen könnte?), the arithmetician Kronecker would respond, “How far can one go
in mathematics with arithmetic alone?” and Hilbert following suit as a logician would
ask, “How far can we go into the transﬁnite using only ﬁnite logical means?”. One must
admit that after the demise of the logicist programme (Frege and Russell) and despite the
efforts of philosophers and logicians to recover Frege’s logicist foundations of arithmetic
with the second-order Hume principle, it is Kronecker’s arithmetics programme which
is still alive in the farthest reaches of contemporary mathematics, arithmetic-algebraic
geometry. That does not mean however that mathematicians inspired by Kronecker from
Hilbert to Weil adhere wholly to the Kroneckerian doctrine of ﬁnitism. On the contrary,
most would allow for methods that leave Kronecker’s arithmetical safe haven and venture
into transarithmetical (set-theoretic), geometrical or analytical (trancendental) extended
universes. A good pilot here is certainly Hilbert himself.
Hilbert introduced ideal elements (ideale Elemente) in order to have a clear-cut divide
between the ﬁnite and the non-ﬁnite, a divide that Aristotelian logic did oversee, because
it could not survey—(Unübersichtlichkeit) in Hilbert’s text (1926)—the extent of its
applications. The idea of the epsilon-calculus for the -symbol was to enable the extension
of the simple laws of Aristotelian logic, excluded middle and universal instantiation with
existential import, to the transﬁnite universe of ideal statements. Once this is achieved, one
could redescend in the ﬁnite by elimination of the ideal elements or the epsilon formulas
by a ﬁnite process in polynomial arithmetic, that is Hilbert’s use of inﬁnite descent
(die Methode der Zurückführung) (see Gauthier 2002, 2011) which reduces transﬁnite
expressions to arithmetical statements. In recent lectures on Hilbert’s programme, Saul

Kripke has seemed to rediscover the same argument (see Kripke 2009). Although Kripke
does not mention inﬁnite descent as in previous lectures, he refers to a minimilazation
argument which amounts to the same for Mirimanoff’s “ensembles ordinaires” obtained
from descent or transitive sets in ZF via the axiom of foundation or regularity—on this
compare (Gauthier 1989, 1997a, 2007).
Intuitionistic logic, after the work of Brouwer, Kolmogorov, Heyting and Gödel,
fares better in discriminating between the ﬁnite and the inﬁnite, simply by rejecting the
extension of classical logical laws beyond the ﬁnite domain and by exploring the potential
inﬁnite. This explains why it is the starting point of the functional interpretation privileged
by applied proof-theorists; in their hands, intuitionistic logic is extended by various non-
constructive principles or one-way translations from intuitionistic logic to classical logic.
There is the foundational shift from Hilbert’s programme and it has proven successful in
recent proof-theoretic research with Kohlenbach (2008a) and others.
If applied proof theory and the proof mining enterprise represent a shift of emphasis
in original (pure!) proof theory as Kohlenbach repeats after Kreisel (Kreisel 1981), it
remains that the idea of extracting more constructive information (with an enrichment
of data) from a given classical proof concurs with the idea of certainty (Sicherheit) or of
certiﬁcation (Sicherung) that Hilbert deﬁned as the ideal goal of his proof theory and the
motto of applied proof theory could very well be “More information, more certainty”.
Detracting from that ideal would mean fruitless prospection for proof-theorists, either
in the abstract realm of constructivist principles or in the mining ﬁeld of promising
applications. Of course, the motto has to be substantiated by further foundational research
into the historical, logico-mathematical and philosophical motives of proof theory. Hilbert
was certainly the ﬁrst mathematician to think of mathematical proofs in terms of a
systematic study of the internal logic of deductive reasoning “das inhaltliche logische
Schliessen” in line with Kronecker’s constructive stance in his general arithmetic “all-
gemeine Arithmetik” for which he claimed “innere Wahrheit und Folgerichtigkeit”, that
is internal truth and consistency; these objectives could very well be shared by applied
proof theory in the search for effective proofs in classical analysis where proofs were
made available by the (constructive and non-constructive) means at hand. Proof theory
puts the emphasis on proofs with the aim of making manifest their constructive hidden
content and I would count such an enterprise as a revival of the Kroneckerian spirit with
the logical means that Hilbert introduced in the programme of the arithmetization of logic
after the arithmetization of analysis by Cauchy and Weirstrass along the arithmetization
of algebra by Kronecker. It is maybe in contemporary theoretical computer science, for
example in computational algebraic geometry with the Gröbner basis technique as well
as in a variety of computational disciplines, that arithmetization can be pursued with a
ﬁnite number of procedures as I would translate Hensel’s phrase (eine endliche Anzahl
von Versuchen). Finitist arithmetism may sound redundant, but it renders the idea of
the arithmetical foundations of mathematics as a ﬁnitist programme quite different from
Weierstrass’ programme claimed by Felix Klein as the epitome of the arithmetization of
mathematics. Arithmetization of analysis in the Cauchy-Weierstrass ﬁle is not really on par
with Kronecker’s foundational entreprise of general arithmetic (allgemeine Arithmetik).

Kronecker’s Foundational Programme
Finally, if Klein’s Erlanger Program as a uniﬁcation of classical geometry based on
the notion of group could be compared according to the category theorist André Joyal
to the Grothendieck program of uniﬁcation of modern algebraic geometry based on the
notion of topos, both programs belong to algebraic foundations. And if Kronecker program
of the arithmetization of algebra were to succeed, for example in Grothendieck’s idea
of an arithmetic (motivic geometry), it would still be in the Kroneckerian spirit that
Grothendieck himself announced in SGA1 when he introduced the notion of scheme
(schéma) as a generalization of Kronecker’s concept of moduli system (Modulsystem).
In that case, the intent and the goal is to obtain concrete arithmetical results on the integers
from abstract algebraic, category-theoretic methods and the like and this is the spirit of
arithmetical logic.

Introduction: The Notion of Analytical Apparatus
The notion of analytical apparatus was introduced in the paper by Hilbert, Nordheim and
von Neumann (1928)  Über die Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik : The analytical
apparatus <der analytische Apparat> is simply the mathematical formalism or the set
of logico-mathematical structures of a physical theory. Von Neumann used the notion
extensively in his 1932 seminal work on the mathematical foundations of Quantum
Mechanics and he stressed particularly the auxiliary notion of conditions of reality
<Realitätsbedingungen>. I want to show that this last notion corresponds grosso modo
to our notion of model in contemporary philosophy of physics. Hermann Weyl, who
has initiated group theory in Quantum Mechanics (1928), also exploited the idea in his
conception of the parallelism between a mathematical formalism and its physical models.
We know that Weyl defended a constructivist interpretation of physics and the exact
sciences in general (see Weyl 1918, 1960). But one can even go further and argue that
Minkowski, a close friend of Hilbert, shared the same idea of the prevalence of the
analytical apparatus over its physical interpretation and it can be shown that in his papers
on physics, particularly his 1908 paper  Raum und Zeit , Minkowski proposed a
derivation of physical geometry from the geometry of numbers in the Leibnizian spirit of
the harmony between pure mathematics and the physical world.
I am drawing here parts from various recent papers of mine, especially from three different sources

Arithmetical Foundations for Physical Theories
5.2
Analytical and Empirical Apparatuses
In order to show the relevance of the concept of analytical apparatus, one needs to
contrast it with the usual notion of the experimental apparatus. The experimental apparatus
is the set of the observation experiments and measurement procedures of experimental
data together with their preparations recorded in a physical instrument or a laboratory
equipment while the analytical apparatus consists solely of the theoretical data, that is,
those data collected from logical and mathematical structures in pure mathematics or in
mathematical physics. The distinction here is ﬁner than the distinction between theoretical
physics and experimental physics, since any physical theory, may it be in applied physics,
needs an analytical apparatus. The laser as an applied measurement device is a good
example of an experimental instrument that would not have been possible without the
quantum theory of Bose-Einstein statistics for symmetric amplitudes. The philosophical
problem of the applicability of mathematics to the physical world is not addressed in that
context as a mystery in E.P. Wigner’s terms, but rather as the relationship between two
apparatuses which process information from two different sources in order to give a full
picture of physical reality. In that picture, experimental data are at ﬁrst overdetermined by
the analytical apparatus through the mediation of models, our new conditions of reality
<Realitätsbedingungen> for a given formalism. The idea of theory-ladenness takes a new
turn in such a perspective and the schema below is meant to illustrate the rôle of models
in the construction of physical theories to the extent that they are supposed to combine a
theoretical framework with the physical universe as interpreted in our theories:
5.3
Models
Arrows (or homomorphisms) on the left show the direction of overdetermination while
arrows on the right indicate that in turn the analytical apparatus can be modiﬁed according
to new conditions of reality reﬂected in the models of the theory. Those models are
multifarious since the analytical apparatus in not canonical—the formalism cannot be
categorical (or univocal) and from a logical point of view there cannot be a standard
model of a physical theory, when it is couched in a ﬁrst-order logical language as shown
by Putnam and others. In the most interesting cases, for example General Relativity or
Quantum Mechanics (with a Hilbert space formalism), physical theories cannot be reduced
to ﬁrst-order languages and theorems like the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem cannot be
applied to generate non-standard models. But even in the case of higher-order theories,
non-principal models coexist with the principal model of a physical theory. A physical
theory has a standard model only from a sociological point of view in the sense that a
standard model in physics or in the sciences in general is the model accepted by a majority
in a given ﬁeld, e.g. the standard model in elementary particle physics. The multiplicity of
models points also to the ﬂexibility of the physical interpretation in view of the rigidity of

5.3
Models
73
the axiomatic or formal part of a physical theory, as Hilbert emphasized. But Hilbert also
insisted that it is only through axiomatization that a concept like probability could loose
its mystical character.
A nice illustration of the complex relationships that are entertained between the
analytical apparatus and the experimental apparatus is the interaction of the observed
system and the observing system in Quantum Mechanics: The observer disposes of
an analytical apparatus which imposes an instrumentalist meaning to the measurement
process, since the probabilistic account of measurement is given in terms of the square
j j2 of the absolute value of the wave function  —a state of affairs derived from the
analytical apparatus related to Hilbert’s work on L2 (square integrable functions).
Of course, Hilbert did not have our notion of model and could not appreciate the
richness of non-standard models either in logic or in physical axiomatics, a ﬁeld he has
invented for a foundational purpose. The logical empiricists (Carnap, Reichenbach et
alii) who conceived of physical theories as semi-interpreted axiomatics systems could not
imagine that the syntactical view of theories could be supplemented or even superseded by
a semantical (one is tempted to say semi-model theoretic) view of physical theories. Notice
that the above schema only depicts the interdependence of analytical and experimental
apparatuses via the double rôle of models as mediators and stresses the dynamical structure
or the constructive content of a physical theory. There is no provision for ontological

74
5
Arithmetical Foundations for Physical Theories
commitments or metaphysical options in our view, except for an overt constructivist
foundational posture in the foundations of physics (and mathematics).
5.4
The Consistency of Physical Theories
Hilbert’s idea of a physical axiomatics is introduced in his 6th problem in his 1900
list. It is the axiomatization of probability and mechanics, he says, that should concern
the mathematician who wishes to secure the foundations of physics as rigorously as
it is achieved in arithmetic and geometry. In his major work (1968, III, pp. 245–387),
Kronecker, who had inspired Hilbert in more ways than one, referred to Kirchhoff’s
mechanics as a model of a scientiﬁc theory for its simplicity and completeness, attributes
he claimed for his own general arithmetic. The same Kirchhoff furnished to Hilbert
a radiation theory for his early work on foundations of physics (1932, III, pp. 217–
257). What we call now Kirchhoff’s law on the equality between rates of emission and
absorption of energy in thermal equilibrium is indeed a good example of a physical domain
that should be investigated in view of the consistency of its axioms. One is reminded here
that Hilbert had made of this question already in 1900 the sixth problem of his list “The
mathematical treatment of the axioms of physics”. Hilbert names probability theory and
mechanics as the two privileged domains of such interpretations. The central problem in
physical theories is still the consistency problem, because a fundamental physical theory
proceeds like geometry from general axioms to more speciﬁc ones and the extension from
the ﬁrst principles to the secondary ones must preserve consistency. Consistency is not
a matter of feeling or experimentation, but of logic, Hilbert insists, and the extension
of the theory of thermal radiation to elementary optics is possible only on the grounds
of consistency. For Hilbert, there is a clear distinction between classical mechanics and
quantum mechanics: on the one hand, you have a deterministic treatment, on the other,
you must employ probabilistic methods to deal with classical and quantum-mechanical
theories. But the differential treatment has to obey the internal logic of a physical theory
which turns out to be of arithmetical nature.
The problem area under discussion is of no particular interest for our purposes, nor
are Hilbert’s contributions to relativity theory (1932, III, pp. 257–289) since they are
mathematical elaborations and only partly foundationally illuminating—Hilbert had also
worked on the foundations of the kinetic theory of gases and other occasional physical
subjects. The work on (general) relativity theory in particular seems to have been inspired
by the groundbreaking inquiries of Weyl, more than by Einstein’s original work (see also
von Neumann 1932). Of greater interest to us is the paper written in collaboration with
von Neumann and Nordheim “On the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics” (1928).
In that paper we ﬁnd the clear exhortation to make explicit the concept of probability
in order to extract the mathematical content from its mystical (philosophical) gangue. But
the main themes are, in my view, associated with the notions of “analytical apparatus”
(analytischer Apparat) and “conditions of reality” (Realitätsbedingungen). Which comes
ﬁrst, the analytical apparatus or conditions of reality, is a matter of foundational outlook
and we shall see how Hilbert conceived a so-called “physical axiomatics”.

5.5
Quantum Mechanics
75
Probabilities and their relationships constitute the material we start from. The physical
requirements a probability theory of physical phenomena has to fulﬁl represent the basis
on which a “simple” analytical apparatus is deﬁned; then follows a physical interpretation
of the analytical structure and if the basis is fully determined, the analytical structure
should be canonical. This is the axiomatic formulation already present in the Hilbertian
foundations of geometry and the general argument leaves no doubt as to the permanence
of the axiomatic ideal in Hilbert’s work on the foundations of physics. What Hilbert seems
to strive to is the conception of a categorical mathematical theory with a multiplicity
of models; however, not all models would be isomorphic. Non-standard models point
rather to a complete ﬁrst-order theory that generates a variety of interpretations. But the
mathematical structure is generally not ﬁrst-order. The dilemma of a physical axiomatics
or of a “physical logic” opens up numerous avenues of research.
The analytical apparatus or the mathematical formalism is ﬁrst conjectured and then
tested through an interpretation in order to check its adequacy. The two components,
analytical apparatus and its physical interpretation, must be sharply distinguished and
that separation has the effect that the formalism is stable throughout the variations of
its (physical) interpretations where some degree of freedom and arbitrariness cannot be
eliminated. However, this is the price to pay for the axiomatization and vague concepts
like probability will ﬁnally loose their fuzzy character. The conditions of reality in general
call for the complex Hilbert space to have models in the reals, but the speciﬁc conditions
of reality for probability will prove to be intrinsically linked with the calculus of Hermitian
operators and Hilbert’s early theory of integral equations. Thus the fact that a probability
measure is real positive depends on the ﬁniteness of the sum
a1x1 C a2x2 C : : :
for a linear function. Hilbert’s result, which is a building-block of the Hilbert space
formalism, was inspired by a similar result of Kronecker on linear forms. Kronecker’s
inﬂuence on Hilbert has also a conservative extension in the foundations of quantum
mechanics (see Kronecker 1889, Chap. 12 and Hilbert 1932, pp. 56–72).
Hilbert’s ideas of the foundations of QM have been made to work by von Neumann
(1932, 1961) in the Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics, which is the standard
formulation of QM. We shall explore in the following the continuation of Hilbert’s
programme in the hands of his followers. I start with a notion which is not found in Hilbert,
but can be traced back to von Neumann’s foundational work in QM.

The usual presentation of QM requires the analytical apparatus of Hilbert space as a linear

space, the closed ones or the subspaces are of special interest for physics (i.e. QM here),
since notions like orthogonal vectors, orthogonal complements, projections, etc., can be
deﬁned on them. It is a well-known fact that not all linear manifolds are closed (see Halmos
1957) and that the set of all linear subsets of the inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space is not
orthocomplementable(see Jauch 1968, p. 122): it is this possibility which I want to exploit,
keeping in mind that a Hilbert space is a metric and topological space. The interesting
fact about Hilbert space from a physical point of view is that it permits the deﬁnition of
orthogonality
.f; g/ D 0
written f?g; the orthogonal complement of f, f ?? obeys the Boolean rule f ?? D f and
f ? forms a subspace of H. For QM, it is important to notice that there is a bijection
between subspaces and projections, i.e. the linear operators E such that EE? D E for
E? the adjoint of E deﬁned by

E?? D E (if E? D E, then E is a self-adjoint or
Hermitian operator). The spectral theorem states that there is a bijection between self-
adjoint operators and spectral measures on (the Borel set of) the real line R1 and the von
Neumann dogma states that there is a bijection between self-adjoint operators and the
observables of QM.1 Let us look at the orthogonal complement: we have seen that f ?? D
f; consequently, the orthogonal complement corresponds to the orthocomplement.a/ D

Other spaces, like Banach spaces, which lack the restriction of orthogonality, do not seem
to be suited to the needs of QM.
1Von Neumann’s dogma has been challenged in 1952 by Wick, Wightman and Wigner who introduced
superselection rules showing that there exist Hermitian operators that do not correspond to observables;
on the other side, Park and Margenau argue that there are observables, for example, the non-commuting x
and z—components of spin which are not represented by Hermitian operators.

5. the projection postulate which states that immediately after a measurement (that is, an
interaction), the superposition P cjj˛j is transformed or reduced to n˛n.
The ﬁfth postulate for the wave packet reduction characterizes von Neumann’s theory of
measurement. For instance, the superposition of states P j˛j is made up of the combined
system—the observer and the observed system—and for von Neumann a measurement
projects the system † in a state n˛n (we neglect the terms of the expansion here). Vectors
n˛n have a well-deﬁned value since projections are in bijection with the subspaces of
the Hilbert space, but the system is no more in a pure state, but in a mixture. Everett’s
multiverse theory (or relative state theory) supposes that the superposition is not reduced
or projected in a determinate state, but ramiﬁes after an interaction in a multitude of
branches each corresponding to a component of the superposition: there would be as many
worlds as there are components and the result of measurement would be valid on only one
world among a (non-denumerable) inﬁnity of universes. Here is the rub, more irritating
than von Neumann’s cut (Schnitt) between the observed system and the observer: the
set of all values of the wave function  is C, the set of complex numbers, which has
the cardinality 2@0; thus, the ramiﬁed  cannot be measured, for the set of all possible
measurements certainly does not exceed @0 and there is no bijection between @0 and
2@0. The inconsistency is fatal in view of Everett’s idea that the formalism generates its
own interpretation. If the ramiﬁcation of  must have a probabilistic objective content,
one is obliged to admit that it cannot emerge from the divergent ramiﬁcation of non-
denumerable probability values, a probability theory being at most -additive, that is
denumerably convergent. Another example of an inconsistent probability theory of QM
is the theory of consistent histories, ﬁrst formulated by Grifﬁths (1984) and adopted since
by some important physicists, Gell-Mann and Hartle, among others. The theory can be
considered as a variant of Everett’s many-universe or multiverse interpretation with a
historical component, since parallel universes can have different histories, that is temporal
sequences of quantum events. In order for a given history to be consistent, it is granted a
weakened logical status which forbids, for instance, joining two incompatible events (e.g.
spin states a and b of an electron) in a classical conjunction a ^ b. These singular histories
must preserve probability measures or -additivity for denumerable measures with the
help of elementary logical notions such as modus ponens, conditional probabilities and
counterfactuals, truth and liability. But the main question is the consistency of consistent
histories. Recent work by Goldstein and Page (1995), Dowker and Kent (1996) tends to
show that Grifﬁth’s theory is inconsistent in its probabilistic assumptions about consistent
histories. From a combinatorial point of view, denumerable or -additivity supposes that
the decomposition of probability measures covers up inconsistent history subsequences
(subsets) as well as consistent but irreconcilable subsequences in the density matrix of
consistent histories; in other words, there is no bijection between the @0 sequences and
the 2@0 subsequences (the power set of all histories) and standard probabilities are lost

in the multiplicity of divergent histories (and subhistories). The lesson to be drawn here is
perhaps that a paraconsistent logic that accommodates contradictions as well as tautologies
can take care of a “quasi-consistency” for the “quasi-classicality” in a mixture of coherent
histories in quantum systems and decoherent histories in classical (macroscopic) systems,
as quantum decoherence theory seems to indicate. But the term “consistency histories”
would nonetheless sound like a misnomer for a theory which makes room for too many
divergent histories, as the universal ramiﬁcation of the wave function would have it in
Everett’s multiverse interpretation.
5.5.2
Probabilities
Hilbert (followed in this by von Neumann) introduced the notion of analytical apparatus
(analytischer Apparat) drawn from the general structure of an axiomatic system in physics
and he made no mystery of his intention to provide physics with the same kind of axiomatic
foundations as geometry. Physical situations must be mirrored in an analytical apparatus,
physical quantities are represented by mathematical constructs which are translated back
into the language of physics in order to give real meaning to empirical statements. The
analytical apparatus is not subjected to change while its physical interpretation has a
variable degree of freedom or arbitrariness. What this means is that the mathematical
formalism of a physical theory is a syntactical structure which does not possess a canonical
interpretation, the analytical apparatus does not generate a unique model. At the same time,
axiomatization helps in clarifying a concept like probability which is thus rescued from its
mystical state. It is noteworthy that another pair of renowned mathematicians, Hardy and
Littlewood, expressed the same opinion at about the same time: “Probability is not a notion
of pure mathematics, but of philosophy or physics.”
Probabilities had, long before Quantum Mechanics, been knocking at the door of
physics, but Laplace had entitled his work Essai philosophique sur les probabilités (1814)
after having called it Théorie analytique des probabilités (1812). Statistical mechanics can
certainly count as a forerunner of QM as far as the statistical behaviour of a large number
of particles is an essential ingredient in the probability theory of quantum-mechanical
systems. But even in the work of pioneers like Born and Pauli, probability has entered
QM somehow through the backdoor and it seems that it is only reluctantly that Born,
for example, has admitted the idea of probability. Later work by Kolmogorov on the
axiomatic foundations of elementary probability theory or von Mises and Reichenbach
on the frequentist interpretation of probability will achieve some measure of success, but
it is the historical advent of a rigorous formalization of the notion of probability as it occurs
in quantum physics which has not been sufﬁciently stressed.
If probability has evidently a multiple application in QM, it remains that it is mainly
a mathematical notion. Von Neumann’s work in 1927–1932 focuses on what is called the
ﬁniteness of the eigenvalue problem. The point here is that any calculation is ﬁnite and
since we have only ﬁnite results, those must be the products of a ﬁnite calculation which is

80

itself made possible only if the analytical apparatus contains the mathematical structures
which enable such calculations. Such a formalism is the complex Hilbert space with
j j2 2 L2 ./
where  is a real positive measure on the functional space L2 (i.e. the equivalence class of
square-integrable functions). The integral
Z
j j2 d
is ﬁnite, which is equivalent to the fact that, in the theory of bounded quadratic forms, the
sum
K .x; x/ D
1
X
p;qD1
kpqxpxq
of all sequences x1; x2; : : : (of complex numbers) is ﬁnite in an orthonormal system of
vectors. That mathematical fact, which Hilbert derived in the theory of integral equations
in 1907, states that a linear expression
k1x1 C k2x2 C : : :
is a linear function, if and only if the sum of the squares of the coefﬁcients in the linear
expression k1; k2; : : : is ﬁnite. The theorem, inspired by Kronecker’s result on linear forms
(homogeneous polynomials), is the very basis of the Hilbert space formulation of QM. No-
tice that on the probabilistic or statistical interpretation, the “acausal” interaction between
an observed system and an observing system takes place in a given experimental situation
and produces a univocal result of ﬁnite statistics for real or realized measurements.
In order for real measurements to have real positive probability values, the analytical
apparatus must satisfy certain realizability conditions, (Realitätsbedingungen) as Hilbert
and von Neumann put it. For example, orthogonality for vectors, linearity and hermiticity
for functional operators and the ﬁniteness of the eigenvalue problem for Hermitian opera-
tors, as in von Neumann’s further work Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik,
are such constraints of realizability.
5.5.3
Logics
The requirements for realizability are not limited to additivity for Hermitian operators—
Grete Hermann seems to have been the ﬁrst one to criticize the requirement on philo-
sophical grounds—but are strictures imposed by the analytical apparatus or the de-
ductive structure of the theory in von Neumann’s terminology. In their joint paper of
1936, Birkhoff and von Neumann, attempt to deﬁne the “logical calculus” of quantum-
mechanical propositions associated with projection operators alluded to in von Neumann

(1932, p. 134). They are led to denote the orthogonal complement (?) as the “negative” of
an experimental proposition in an orthocomplemented lattice satisfying
1. a?? D a
2. a 
 b; iff b? 
 a?
3. a ^ a? D 0
4. a _ a? D 1:
The dual antiautomorphism of period two (or the involuntary antiautomorphism of
projective geometry) does not however uniquely determine complements in a continuous
geometry and von Neumann came back to quantum logic in his paper “Quantum Logics”
(1961) with the discussion of a continuous geometry without points and whose elements
are all the linear subspaces of a given space (more general than a Hilbert space); von
Neumann thought that the logic of quantum probabilities (frequencies) could be built
upon such a geometry. But here the probability measures must be inﬁnite in order to
be convergent and the probability statements that express those measures are required
to have a ﬁnite meaning, as Reichenbach claimed for the veriﬁability theory of his
probability theory. Von Neumann was dissatisﬁed with Hilbert space vector formalism—
but was unable to deﬁne a ﬁnite probability theory for his abstract projective geometry
framework—the type II factor of a modular non-atomic lattice.
In that context, Birkhoff and von Neumann deny the distributive law of logic in favour
of a weaker modular identity or orthomodularity
a 
 b ! a _ b .b ^ c/ D .a _ b/ ^ c
weakened by Jauch and Piron to
a 
 b iff a and b are compatible
(compatibility is an equivalence relation which is symmetric, but not transitive). The
underlying logic here is the non-commutativity of operators P1 et P2
P1P2 ¤ P2P1
of which the uncertainty relations are “a direct intuitive explanation,” as Heisenberg said.
But the denial of the distributive law did not prove to be sufﬁcient basis for a quantum
logic, that is an internal logic of quantum mechanics.
The quantum logic of Jauch and Piron is another example of an impossibility proof
for hidden variables as compatible propositions in the framework of essentially non-
compatible quantum-mechanical propositions. Kochen and Specker devised rather a
quantum logic for a partial Boolean algebra of commuting (or “commeasurable,” as
they say, (1967, p. 64)) quantum-mechanical observables (or propositions) which is not
embeddable in a commutative Boolean algebra—there is no 2-valued homomorphism h
from the partial algebra A to the Boolean algebra B with the properties
1. h .a/ h .a/ h .b/

2. h .a C b/ D  .h .a//  .h .b//
3. h .ab/ D h .a/ h .b/
4. h .1/ D 1
where is the relation of commensurability, a; b are elements of A and ;  belong to a ﬁeld
of sets K (compare with the relation of compatibility deﬁned in 2.4 above).
The fact that the 2-valued propositions form a commutative algebra which does not
imbed commeasurable quantum-mechanical propositions can be seen as a far-reaching
consequence of Gleason’s theorem on the measure of the closed subspaces of a Hilbert
space (Gleason 1957). See Hrukovski and Pitkowsky (2004) for contructive proofs.
5.5.4
Local Complementation
Even in the case of set complementation (as in the theory of Hilbert spaces), we can
have local complementation. Consider Hilbert space as a metric and a topological space;
D is in this case the set of subspaces of the Hilbert space and E is obtained by local
complementation; E is the “location” of the local observer. We shall see that the Hilbert
space can make room for a notion of local observer: the observer becomes the (local)
complement of the observable, i.e. the closed linear manifolds of the Hilbert space—
of course the whole Hilbert space contains all bounded linear transformations (deﬁned
on open subsets) and is therefore not orthocomplementable. But here we obtain non-
orthocomplementability in a different way. (Remember that in a ﬁnite-dimensional space,
every linear manifold is closed).
Theorem. Hilbert space admits the observer through local negation (or complementation)
—that is, we do not have orthocomplentation on the whole Hilbert space even in the ﬁnite-
dimensional case (For the notion of local negation, see Gauthier 1985).
Proof. Let H be an n-dimensional Hilbert space and let F? be the set of closed linear
manifolds f ?, F? D F, the closure of all f. One can now deﬁne the relative complement
FC of F such that HF D FC; FC is then an open subset. From the topology, we pass
to the metric of H; for the metric of H, a subset A of H is located (this notion of located
subset has been introduced by Brouwer. E. Bishop has put it to use in his Foundations of
Constructive Analysis (1967), if the distance
8x 2 H Œ .x; A/  inf f .x; y/ W y 2 Ag

which is open, since
8x; y 2 H Œ .x; A/ 
  .x; y/ C  .y; A/ :
Here the observer has a topological and metrical place as the local complement of the
closed set of subspaces of H. In order to further constructivize this result, I introduce the
topological boundary operator b which is to be interpreted as the boundary between the
observable (or observed) and the observer : we have the relations
E D :D  b .E/
and
D D :E [ b .D/
thus
:D .H/ D E .H/  b .E .H// :
The interior of E, i.e. Eı, is the complement of the closure of the complement of E and is
thus open; we have also
E D Eı:
For any x, D .:x/ means that x 2 E. So for some a, we have
E .a/ D D .: a/  b .D .: a// I
On the other hand, the closure of D, i.e. D implies that
B .D .: a// D a \ .D  a/ :
Hence
A D a [ b .D .: a//
and
a 2 E .H/ D a 2 D .H/ [ b .a 2 D .H//
and
a 2 D .H/ D a 2 E .H/  b .E .H//

which shows that E is disjoint from its boundary, that is, it is open and consequently the
whole Hilbert space D .H/ [ E .H/ is not orthocomplementable, since local complemen-
tation excludes .a/ D a.2
Remark: the effect of abandoning orthocomplementation amounts to adopting an indeﬁnite
metric which may, in fact, be more convenient for some physical theories (e.g. quantum
ﬁeld theory).
5.5.5
The Total Hilbert Space
Gleason’s theorem says that in a separable Hilbert space of dim 	 3, every measure on the
closed subspaces has the form
 .A/ D Tr .WPA/
where the trace Tr means TrX D P
R

'R; X'R

for any complete system of normalized
orthogonal vectors 'R; PA denotes the orthogonal projection of A and W is a Hermitian
operator which satisﬁes
W > 0; TrW D 1 and W2 
 W:
Since the sum for the linear span B over a countable set of orthogonal subspaces Ai
 .B/ D
X
 .Ai/
is ﬁnite,  can be regarded as a real positive measure on the functional space L2 as we saw
above. Gleason’s result states that “frame functions” deﬁned on the unit sphere are regular,
that is, there exists a self-adjoint operator T deﬁned on the Hilbert space H such that the
frame function f is
f .x/  .Tx; x/ :
When the (real) Hilbert space is ﬁnite-dimensional, the frame functions are regular, iff
they are the restriction to the unit sphere of quadratic forms (homogeneous polynomials of
degree 2)—again in accordance with the Hilbert-Kronecker theorem on the ﬁnite sum of
the squares of coefﬁcients in a linear expression. But the total Hilbert space containing not
only the subspaces (closed varieties), but all the linear varieties is inﬁnite-dimensional and
is not orthocomplementable.In view of the fact that complements in the total Hilbert space
cannot be uniquely determined, a fact that von Neumann and Birkhoff had noticed, one
can introduce a local or relative complement in the lattice of open subsets of H beyond the
2Orthocomplementation requires that .a/ D a; a \ a D ; and a  b $ b  a.

5.5

closed sequence of subspaces ofH. Topologically then, the local complement is an open
subset of H and the topological boundary operator separates the space of the observed
system from the space of the observing system, since points on the boundary are neither
in A nor in X  A for a given set and its complement in a topological space X. All linear
varieties are closed in a ﬁnite-dimensional space H, and we have to “open up” that space;
we need to locate ﬁnitely the relative complement and a metric to that effect can be deﬁned
on the topology. Brouwer has introduced the notion of located subset for subsequences: a
subsequence A of B, i.e. A  B, is localised, if there exists a distance  (for points x and y)
such that
8x 2 H Œ .x; A/  inf fp .x; y/ W y 2 Ag :
The metric local complement A of the subsequence A is
A  fx W x 2 H;  .x; A/ > 0g
and is open, since
8x; y 2 H Œ .x; A/ 
  .x; y/ C  .y; A/ :
The notion of local complement with its distance function constitutes the basis of a
probability calculus which differs from the classical notions.
5.5.6
Finite Derivation of the Local Complement
In accordance with Hilbert’s result on ﬁnite sums for linear expressions, the local
complement of our probability calculus is also embedded in a ﬁnite form. Instead of
Kolmogorov’s inﬁnite probability space, we have a ﬁnite probability space as in Nelson
(1987a,b): a ﬁnite probability space is a ﬁnite set  and a (strictly positive) function pr on
 such that for ! 2 

arithmetic ﬁnite descent from a given n to the ﬁrst ordinal (0, or 1). The ﬁnite descent
(or derivation) is applied to a probability calculus, but it could be applied also to a
propositional calculus as in Kochen and Specker (1967). The interesting difference is that
the calculus is no more classical nor Boolean, but intuitionistic, since the local complement
corresponds to intuitionistic implication
a ! b D In ..X  a/ [ b/
and the algebra of propositions (or events) is not even a partial Boolean algebra, but a
Brouwerian lattice, that is a partially ordered set with two binary operations (meet and
join) and a relative “pseudo-complement”

Heyting algebra, which is the algebraic structure corresponding to the intuitionistic logic
of propositions. The open subsets of a topological space also determine a Brouwerian
lattice.

where In is the set of interior points and A; B; C are open subsets of a topological space X

the main distinctive feature of a Brouwerian lattice. We see that probabilities according to
the local complement do not satisfy the Boolean equality or duality and make it possible
to adjoin an intermediary or included third, that is the open subset B here. The expectation

where :A is the local complement of the space of events. For non-interactive systems
and dispersion-free states, the local complement has a negligible effect on the statistics.
But in quantum interactive systems (where a measurement is some kind of interaction
between an observed system and an observing system), the statistical weight of the
local complement cannot be ignored, although it is conﬁned and indeterminate. The
indeterminacy has something to do with the Indeterminacy or Uncertainty relations,
but only indirectly in that the local complement acquires a determinate value upon
measurement and only within actual measurement results as a relative complementation
of probabilities. It might be the place here to put some emphasis on the indeterminacy
relations “Unbetimmtheitsrelationen”. As one knows, quantum mechanics can be derived
entirely from those determinate relations, for instance between the position x and the

which makes it clear that probability is ingrained in the analytical apparatus of QM,
since it coincides with the mathematical structure of QM and its measurement theory.
Again, reﬁnements of measurements reveal that the interaction between the observed
system and the external observing system is the essence of the Copenhagen (Bohr-
Heisenberg) interpretation of QM and as far as the entropic (Shannon) information is
involved H D K log p, the local observer is one more time the (entropic or anthropic?)
informant, since in statististical mechanics, entropy is a measure of uncertainty or, better
said, of indeterminacy as in quantum mechanics. And it should not be a surprise to observe
that the formalisms of quantum mechanics and statististical mechanics are intertranslatable
for the simple fact that the Markov stochastic processes active in the latter are memoryless
when it comes to measurement. There is no mystery in probability, as Hardy and Hilbert
had deplored, when it becomes measured in an actual measurement—with or without
von Neumann entropy for the wave function collapse—and the same demystiﬁcation
applies to Everett’s internal observer who gets caught in the collapse and is then split
or ramiﬁed in as many universes as there are in the uncountable cardinality of the
wave function where measurements, according to Everett’s relative state theory, could be
(ideally) perfectly accurate and not only approximate as they are in the actual world. Such
an ideal universe or multiverse is not really different from an unstable or false metastable
vacuum of quantum ﬁeld theory in which someone might ﬁnd some true nothingness
(L. M. Krauss) turning into something! More seriously, uniﬁed theories which look for
stringy or granular ultimate constituents of the ground stuff (Urstoff in German), String
Theory with supersymmetry and supergravity or Loop Quantum Gravity, are trying to
ﬁnd a common ground between Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity. Quantum
ﬂuctuations of the true vacuum are deﬁned as Heisenberg indeterminacy relations between

What this means is that the quantum vacuum is full of energy—potentially beyond the
Higgs mass at 125 GeV and even Planck length at 1033 cm—the nothing universe, to
mock Krauss’ popular title “A Universe from Nothing”, is impatient to rush into being and
become something real before a Big Bang in the standard model or after a (Bojowald’s)
Big Bounce or forever in a Penrose’s ekpyrotic cyclic universe (or whatever in a non-
standard alternative cosmological scenario, inﬂationary or not). In any case, the old adage
still stands “Ex nihilo, nihil ﬁt” which could be translated or paraphrased as “From nothing,
nothing ﬁts”!
It is possible to reconstruct the EPR argument for “elements-of-reality” without Bell’s
inequalities by appealing to indirect measurements or reductio ad absurdum arguments.
The contextuality and nonlocality appear as features of a realist interpretation incompatible
with QM to the extent that undeﬁned values for observables of QM become deﬁnite
for “elements-of-reality” in the EPR reconstruction. The simple case of the spin angular
momentum will sufﬁce for our argument.
The fundamental relationship for the x; y; z components of spin along the x; y; z
axes is (S being the spin observable and squaring)
S2
x C S2
y C S2
z D S2:
Direct measurement of the z component excludes attributing deﬁnite values to the other
components, but realism speciﬁcally supposes that there are independent “elements-of-
reality” that can be subjected to indirect measurements.
Léon Rosenfeld, a harsh defender of the Copenhagen interpretation, summarizes the
instrumentalist view:
A phenomenon is therefore a process (endowed with the characteristic quantal wholeness) involving
a deﬁnite type of interaction between the system and the apparatus (1967, p. 82).
Thus, the probability calculus must be inherent to the quantum-mechanical measure-
ment process. The tacit assumption of a classical probability structure must be questioned
and a better adjustment of the analytical apparatus and its physical interpretation remains
a lasting problem for foundational research. The completeness of Quantum Mechanics,
despite Bell’s pronouncement, is such a problem, may it be of a quantum-logical
or mathematical nature. The topological solution suggested here has instrumentalist

overtones, but it aims essentially at explaining Quantum Mechanics as the physics of
“local” experiments. Although the metaphysics of wholeness or non-separability is not
totally dispelled by such an attempt, it might provide the sceptic with some good reasons
not to despair about the so-called incompleteness of Quantum Mechanics in his search
for reality. As Redhead (1987, p. 45) puts it, on Bohr’s complementarity interpretation,
the value of an observable Q, when the state of the system is not an eigenstate of Q, is
undeﬁned or “meaningless” and one cannot impugn such an interpretation by denying a
locality principle which says that a previously undeﬁned value for an observable cannot be
deﬁned by measurements performed “at a distance”. On Redhead’s reckoning, the charge
of incompleteness cannot be levelled against Bohr’s view, unless staunch realism and
non-constructive reductio ad absurdum arguments are invoked. But if the Indeterminacy
or Uncertainty Principle has given rise to a non-commutative geometry and analysis
(A. Connes), Bohr’s Complementarity Principle could yield on a par a non-classical logic
and probability calculus. And this militates for a proportionate anti-realist or, as I prefer to
say, a constructivist (instrumentalist) interpretation of QM.
5.6
Riemannian Geometry
Hermann Weyl’s foundational stance in mathematics is many-faceted. From the predica-
tive mathematics of Das Kontinuum (1917) to the constructivist Kroneckerian point of
view of Algebraic theory of numbers (1939), Weyl has sustained a continuous effort to
defend a constructivist philosophy in mathematics, physics and science in general. I do
not want to put any emphasis on his philosophical inspirations from Kant and Fichte to
Husserl and Brouwer. I shall rather insist on the motivations internal to his mathematical
work and particularly on his appraisal of Riemannian geometry, which has played a major
role in Weyl’s theoretical endeavours.
I recall the main ideas of Riemann’s 1867 paper “Über die Hypothesen welche der
Geometrie zu grunde liegen”, “On the hypotheses of the foundations of geometry”
(Riemann 1990). The concept of an n-dimensional manifold or space (Mannigfaltigkeit) is
a topological one, that is, it is to be treated with continuous (real and complex) functions.
As a metric space, it is endowed with the metric invariant ds2 and here Riemann refers to
Gauss’ theory of curved surfaces.
The fundamental quantity for any surface is the element of arc length
ds2 D dx2 C dy2 C dz2:
Gauss had given a general form to this notion of distance by introducing parameters u and
v to represent the coordinates (x; y; z) of any point on the surface and had obtained
ds2 D e.u; v/dv2 C 2f.u; v/dudv C g.u; v/dv2
(where e; f; g are functions of the parameters u and v). The general formula for the ds2 is
ds2 D gmndxmdxn

92
5
Arithmetical Foundations for Physical Theories
where dxm and dxn are the inﬁnitesimal transformations of the parameterized curves on
the surface; and the gmn are the quantities that depend on those curves. The curvature of
a surface is then determined from this fundamental quadratic form; this is the point of
departure of Riemann’s work. The local or inﬁnitesimal approach favoured by Riemann
allows for a generalization of Gauss’ surfaces into the n-dimensional manifold with the
metrical groundform or fundamental metrical tensor (Weyl 1950, p. 39)
ds2 D guvdxudxv.for u, v D 1; : : : ; n/
which controls the behaviour of the geodesics for a point and a direction in an n-
dimensional manifold.
The local inﬁnitesimal point of view insures that the Pythagorean theorem is valid
in the inﬁnitely small and in his remarks on Riemann’s lecture, Weyl insists again
on the fact that the differential form ds2 is not only the simplest, but also the most
appropriate one for the classiﬁcation of all possible geometries, as I have said above.
Group theory enters the picture as, for example, in the case of the alternate subgroup
of even permutations of a given group for the distinction between geometries of various
dimensions. But Pythagorean-Riemannian geometry is a special case and Weyl adds that
one has to supplement the names of Lie and Helmholtz in order to have inﬁnitesimal
mobility (Beweglichkeit) in an n-dimensional manifold.
The inﬁnitesimal Lie group of rotations obeys the same positive deﬁnite quadratic form
and also validates the Pythagorean theorem in the inﬁnitely small. Weyl points out that his
solution to the new problem of space implied in Relativity Theory, as he says, had urged
him to construct a different solution, that is the afﬁne geometry of parallel displacement
which Weyl will put to use in his Raum, Zeit, Materie, (“Space, Time, Matter”) of 1918
(Weyl 1950).
5.7
Riemann’s “Hypotheses”
Weyl has put the emphasis on Riemann’s achievement for being the ﬁrst to deﬁne the idea
of a physical geometry. Against all former mathematicians and philosophers, Weyl says it
is Riemann who maintains that the metric ﬁeld is determined by the material content of
the world and has the same status as the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In a Riemannian manifold
of constant curvature, free mobility is guaranteed by the Lie group of rotations. But this
again implies that the physical content of the space participates in the metric in such
a way that it is the distribution of matter which deﬁnes ultimately the metric ﬁeld, an
idea rediscovered by Einstein, Weyl tells us. It is not doubtful that Riemann did have
such a scientiﬁc objective. In his Pariser Arbeit, for example, he deals with the linear
transformations involved in second-order differential equations to tackle the problem of
an isothermic system again in terms of a fundamental quadratic form. In many of his
works, Riemann could be considered as a mathematical physicist, as Weyl suggests, and
I would suggest that he could be considered also as a philosopher of science, at least to
the extent that he has expressed himself even so brieﬂy on matters philosophical. Take, for
instance, Riemann’s notion of hypothesis.

5.8
Physical Geometry
93
As a student of the Kantian Herbart, who had defended a kind of physical a priori,
Riemann distinguishes his sense of hypothesis from the Newtonian notion found in
Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica:
Quidquid enim ex Phaenomenis non deducitur, Hypothesis vocanda est.
Riemann prefers to deﬁne hypothesis as anything (concepts and principles) that goes
beyond phenomena, and not as ﬁgments of one’s imagination:
Man pﬂegt jetzt unter Hypothese Alles zu der Erscheinungen Hinzugedachte zu verstehen (Riemann
1990, p. 525).
For Riemann, hypotheses and facts <Thatsachen> share a common status as conceptual
structures that supervene on phenomena; the law of inertia, for example, as a law of motion
is a hypothesis, not different from an axiom, since it belongs to the transempirical or
empirical a priori realm, while an axiom in the traditional sense should be analytical.
By the same token, one could say that facts are the same as hypotheses and Helmholtz’
1868 work <Über die Thatsachen die der Geometrie zugrunde liegen> stands in perfect
continuity with Riemann’s notion of hypothesis. As a matter of fact, Riemann states the law
of inertia as a counterfactual conditional, much in the manner of later logical positivism:
If there were only a single material point in the world moving in space at a deﬁnite velocity, it
would always move with the same velocity. (My translation of Riemann 1990, p. 525).
Riemann’s notion of hypothesis reaches beyond Kant to Descartes and Aristotle. One
could justify the hypothetico-deductive method by quoting Descartes who says in his
Principles of Philosophy (IV, 204):
For the things that our senses cannot reach, it sufﬁces to explain how they could be.
Descartes adds: it is exactly what Aristotle has done and he refers here to Aristotle’s
Meteors (I, p. 7):
If it is true that for phenomena which escape our senses we deem to have given a rational
explanation by ascending to their possible causes, it is certainly true for those phenomena which
we now study (the meteors).
This anagogical way has been called abduction by Peirce and it is certainly part of
what has been termed  inference to the best explanation . In any case and without
pouring too much philosophy into Riemann’s sparse remarks, one should not neglect the
foundational motivations in Riemann’s mathematical work.
5.8
Physical Geometry
In the Special Theory of Relativity, the Minkowskian four-dimensional manifold is
Euclidean, but the quadratic form here is not positive deﬁnite, it has an index of inertia
of 1; it is then called semi-Riemannian as in the case of Special Relativity
ds2 D dx2 C dy2 C dz2  c2dt2

94
5
Arithmetical Foundations for Physical Theories
while in the General Theory, the manifold is Riemannian, since the gravitational material
content of the world forces a curvature onto the structure of the metric ﬁeld.
Incidentally, Riemann points out in his lecture that such a curved space or spherical
universe could be unlimited in extension without being inﬁnite from the point of view
of measurement. In the case of a space with positive curvature, however small it is, an
unlimited spherical surface is necessarily ﬁnite (Riemann 1990, p. 284).
In his paper “Reine Inﬁnitesimalgeometrie”, Pure Inﬁnitesimal Geometry (1918), Weyl
declares that Riemann is not always consequent, for inﬁnitesimal geometry forbids to
relate two ﬁnite elements when they are at an arbitrary ﬁnite distance from each other,
as Riemann supposes. The relation is possible only in inﬁnitesimal afﬁne geometry for
inﬁnitely near points. As Weyl puts it in Space, Time, Matter, it is:
The principle of gaining knowledge of the external world from the behaviour of its inﬁnitesimal
parts. In a Riemannian geometry, geodesics have a stationary length, which is not the case in afﬁne
geometry (Weyl 1950, p. 193).
I want to comment brieﬂy on the fate of Weyl’s own geometrical idea of afﬁne geometry,
an idea which has been instrumental in his uniﬁed ﬁeld theory of electromagnetism and
gravitation in Raum, Zeit, Materie.
Weyl indicates that an afﬁne relationship or transfer of direction and not only of length
in inﬁnitesimal parallel displacements is inherent in metric space. The metric ﬁeld is still
dominated by the quadratic form ds2 while the electromagnetic ﬁeld is endowed with a
linear fundamental form 'idxi which has its origin in the metric ﬁeld. Weyl will admit later
that the gauge invariance between the electromagnetic and the gravitational ﬁelds was to be
grounded on a more fundamental quantum theory. He had also introduced a cosmological
constant as Einstein did, but Weyl thought that Einstein’s lambda () was arbitrary, as
Einstein later admitted, for it was meant only to insure spatial closure of a stationary
universe, while Weyl claims an inner necessity for his own , because his afﬁne geometry
accounts for the electromagnetic potentials and fully obey Maxwell’s equations which
demand the equilibrium state of the total mass of a closed universe. An inner necessity
however which ﬁnally vanished like Einstein’s blunder. The fact that it is revived today
in supersymmetry theories is evidence that blunders have their own constancy, if not their
own cosmology. There remains though Weyl’s fundamental idea of a uniﬁed theory based
on gauge invariance which is still a major building block in contemporary physics. But
Weyl has also emphasized the Minskowskian world picture in Relativity Theory.
5.9
Minkowski’s Spacetime
I am interested here in the connection of Minkowski’s spacetime formulation of Special
Relativity with his geometry of numbers or Geometrie der Zahlen which Minkowski had
developed prior to his famous 1908 paper “Raum und Zeit”. There is an inner mathemat-
ical connection between the two enterprises and I want to argue that spacetime diagrams
are an illustration in physical geometry of a central scheme in the geometry of numbers
which was the main endeavour of Minkowski’s mathematical career. Minkowski’s work

5.9
Minkowski’s Spacetime
95
in physics belongs to mathematical physics and his statement at the end of the “Raum und
Zeit” paper can be counted as the philosophical motto of the mathematical physicist:
With the elaboration of its mathematical consequences, there will be plenty of hints for the
experimental conﬁrmation of the postulate (of the absolute world), so that anyone who feels
uncomfortable with the loss of traditional pictures (Anschauungen) will ﬁnd himself compensated
with the idea of a preestablished harmony between physics and pure mathematics. (Minkowski
1967, my translation)
Such a declaration of principle echoes Minkowski’s assessment of Dirichlet’s achieve-
ments in mathematical physics—see his 1905 address “Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet
und seine Bedeutung für die heutige Mathematik” (in Minkowski 1967, II, pp. 449–
461). Minkowski says that the two directions of number theory and mathematical
physics, though they seem to diverge, are harmoniously integrated in Dirichlet’s work
by the use of the integral calculus. Here Minkowski mentions Dirichlet’s results on the
convergence of Fourier series and the Dirichlet principle on the minima of the potential
function. In praising Dirichlet for having introduced discontinuous factors in the multiple
integrals of the potential function, Minkowski evokes Leibniz’s idea of a grand scheme
for a perfectly harmonious world. This mathematician’s dream was encapsulated in
Minkowski’s postulate of the absolute world and I want to explore now its mathematical
motivation.
Hermann Weyl credited Minkowski for having recognized that:
The fundamental equations for moving bodies are determined by the principle of relativity if
Maxwell’s theory for matter at rest is taken for granted. (Weyl 1960)
He also said, referring to Minkowski’s 1907 paper “Die Grundgleichungen für die
elektromagnetischen Vorgänge in bewegten Körper” (in Minkowski 1967, II, pp. 352–404)
or “The Fundamental Equations for the Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies”,
that:
The adequate mathematical formulation of Einstein’s discovery was ﬁrst given by Minkowski: to
him we are indebted for the idea of four-dimensional world-geometry. (Weyl 1960)
Minkowski had distinguished in the aforementioned paper the theorem of relativity
from the principle of relativity; the ﬁrst is purely mathematical in terms of the covariance of
Lorentz transformations and the second, the principle of relativity, allows, in Minkowski’s
words, for the derivation of the laws of mechanics solely from the principle of the
conservation of energy. The language here is still of spacetime vectors and does not
anticipate on the 1908 paper on “Raum und Zeit” where the vocabulary of worldpoints and
worldlines is canonized and serves as the basic ingredient for a graphic representation, as
Minkowski says, of the group of spatiotemporal transformations. Minkowski then suggests
that the terminology for the postulate of relativity is rather dull—“matt” in German—
when one wants to stress the invariance properties of the group of the transformations and
he comes up with his “postulate of the absolute world” (Postulat der absoluten Welt). Let
me point out that at one time Einstein himself had wanted to rename relativity theory as
invariant theory.
My contention is that Minkowski’s idiom has essentially a mathematical meaning as
a representational means for the spatiotemporal structure of the physical world. And

96
5
Arithmetical Foundations for Physical Theories
I assume that Weyl did not interpret the Minkowskian mathematical picture otherwise
(see Gauthier 2005). I shall give some reasons to substantiate that claim in the following.
5.10
Geometry of Numbers
Minkowski’s work on physical problems (hydrodynamics, capillarity, etc., and on rela-
tivity theory) is marginal compared to his endeavour in number theory, geometry and
especially what Minkowski called the geometry of numbers. It is in the geometrical
representation of number-theoretic relations that Minkowski introduces the notion of
Zahlengitter or number grids. Minkowski deﬁnes there a three-dimensional number
grid as a geometrical representation of three integers in rectangular coordinates—see
“Über Geometrie der Zahlen” (Minkowski 1967, I, pp. 264–265). These three integers
correspond to discrete points in space; and these points in turn represent bodies (Körper)
and the main question is the content of the surface (Flächeninhalt) on which those bodies
ﬂoat or are immersed in, so to speak. To illustrate this train of thought, let us look at a
diagram drawn by Minkowski to deﬁne the approximation of a real quantity (number) by
rational numbers (Fig. 5.1):
The three grid points H, J and K on the straight line Y D 1 stand in the following
relation: HJ D JK D OA for O the null point at the center of the grid and A a point
corresponding to K on the straight line G parallel to Y D 1. The inscribed parallelogram
does not contain any other grid point besides O in its interior. Minkowski uses such
diagrams to show that two relatively prime numbers x and y can be represented by linear
forms  D ˛x C ˇy;  D 
x C ıy for the straight lines  and  with arbitrary coefﬁcients
˛; ˇ; 
; ı and a determinant ˛ı  ˇ
 D 1 so that the norm or the length between x and y
(not both zero) is
j  j 
 1=2:

5.10
Geometry of Numbers
97
Fig. 5.2 “Diagonalketten”
(diagonal chains) from
Minkowski (1967, II, p. 45)
Minkowski’s diagrams and calculations are quite involved as is shown by the following
diagram intended to illustrate the “very intuitive link between all the possible solutions of
the inequality j  j 
 1=2 in whole numbers without common divisors” in Minkowski’s
words (Fig. 5.2):
Here Minkowski uses continued fractions to obtain the desired inequality
1=2 <  < 1=2
for what he calls diagonal chains of continued fractions (Diagonalkettenbrüche).
This geometry of numbers has an arithmetical core, while geometry has an intuitive
appeal. The main idea is to inscribe triangles or parallelograms in rectangular Cartesian
coordinates in order to represent geometrically the reticular system or grid (Gitter) of all
grid points (Gitterpunkte) of positive quadratic forms with integer coefﬁcients. A number
grid or mesh or point lattice (as it is now called when points have integer coefﬁcients)
is most important for the representation of the volume of a body and its fundamental
arithmetical property is the generalization of the length of a straight line into the principle
that in a triangle the sum of the lengths of two sides is never smaller than the length of

98

the third side. As a special case, one easily points to the Pythagorean Theorem for right
triangles:
c2 D a2 C b2
which is at the foundation of the differential form
ds2 D dx2
1 C dx2
2
in Euclidean coordinates. Weyl pointed out that the differential form ds2 is not only the
simplest, but also the canon for the classiﬁcation of possible geometries since the positive
quadratic form generates all linear transformations of the variables involved as a unique
mathematical structure. Of course, the ds2 is the fundamental (quadratic) form
ds2 D c2dt2  dx2  dy2  dz2
for the invariant metric element in Special Relativity. Let me remark that if one lifts the
quadratic restriction, one gets Finsler spaces which are akin to Riemannian spaces. I do
not need to mention that Minkowski devoted much of his work to the theory of quadratic
forms, i.e. homogeneous polynomials of the second degree, which were the main object
of study in number theory from Gauss to Kronecker. Rather than elaborate on this, I can
only mention that number grids are clearly connected to what we now call Minkowski
diagrams.
5.11
Spacetime Diagrams
In his mathematical diagrams, Minkowski depicts grid points and intersection points for
the approximation of a real number (or quantity) by rational numbers or diagonal chains
of continued fractions that illustrate the fact that in a triangle the sum of the lengths of two
sides cannot be smaller than the length of the third one. Here entire rational functions are
used as denominators of continued fractions. What we have is an intuitive representation
of solutions of a real inequality in terms of integers without common divisors.
Those diagrams do not differ essentially from the ones which are to be found in the
paper “Raum und Zeit”. What is represented here as a grid point is the notion of an
arbitrary point like charge or electron or potential ﬁeld (with vector potential and scalar
potential components) in a light cone. The world postulate or the postulate of the absolute
world is nothing more than the totality of those grid points along grid lines in a gridded
universe without any ontological import.
To obtain a physical picture for Minkowski’s diagrams, one has to make the assumption
of a correspondence between the energy vector of motion and the energy vector in motion,
as Minkowski clearly said:
Der Kraftvektor der Bewegung ist gleich dem bewegenden Kraftvektor. (Minkowski 1967, II, p. 441)

5.11
Spacetime Diagrams
99
Fig. 5.3 From Minkowski
(1967, II, p. 442)
What this means is that motion can only be represented by the picture of a moving
vector on a continuous line, a worldline as a moving world point; diagrams can then be
drawn to picture motion in a physical geometry as grids were used to cover the content of
a surface (Flächeninhalt) in a geometry of numbers (arithmetical geometry). The parallel
between the two tasks, to cover a surface with numerical grids and to ﬁll up a two-
dimensional space with diagrams, strongly suggests that there is a continuous path in
Minkowski’s mathematical Weltanschauung or theoretical construction of the world, to
use Weyl’s terminology. Let us examine in detail the following diagram (Fig. 5.3).
The diagram depicts an electron e in motion along its worldline through worldpoints P,
P1 and Q. Minkowski wants to describe here a moving pointlike charge in the “absolute
world”, that is in a four-dimensional continuum with three space coordinates x, y and z and
a time coordinate t. The vector P1Q has a norm or length r, whereas the vector PQ has a
length e=r since P lies on the tangent orthogonal to P1Q which cuts through the worldline
of e. All this combined with c, the speed of light in the light cone, deﬁnes the potential
ﬁeld of the pointlike electron e at point P1. Set against the negative curvature hyperbola of
the timelike world line, the diagram should provide the appropriate scene for the equations
of the ponderomotive force in an electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Let us remark that this diagram is meant to represent a four-dimensional world—
there are continuous curved lines—while the diagrams in the geometry of numbers were
meant to represent a three-dimensional world of spatial bodies (Körper)—there were
only continuous straight lines. The four-dimensional world is of course expressed in the
quadratic form
dt2 D dx2  dy2  dz2  ds2

100

or equivalently for the invariant metric element
ds2 D c2dt2  dx2  dy2  dz2
which is the central formulation of Minkowski’s version of Special Relativity.
5.12
Physical Axiomatics
Is this Minkowskian representation a physical or a mathematical one? In view of
Minkowski’s pronouncements on mathematical physics, one would be tempted to advocate
a purely mathematical treatment. This might be the reason why Einstein was reluctant at
ﬁrst to adopt Minkowski’s formulation. I would rather put Minkowski’s achievements in
the Hilbertian tradition of the axiomatization of physics. We know that Hilbert was a close
friend of Minkowski’s and he praised him on many occasions.
One is reminded that Hilbert had put the problem of “The mathematical treatment of
the axioms of physics” as the number 6 item on his famous 1900 list of mathematical
problems. Hilbert names probability theory and mechanics as the two major candidates
for axiomatization. The central problem in physical theories is the consistency problem in
Hilbert’s view because a fundamental physical theory proceeds like geometry from general
axioms to more speciﬁc ones and the extension from the ﬁrst principles to the secondary
ones must preserve consistency. Consistency is not a matter of feeling or experimentation,
but of logic (or mathematics), Hilbert insists.
Hilbert’s ideas of the foundations of Quantum Mechanics have been made to work
by von Neumann in the Hilbert space formulation, which is the standard formulation of
Quantum Mechanics. From my point of view, Minkowski’s diagrams belong to the models
of a canonical analytical apparatus and I want to come back to Minkowski’s other works
in mathematical physics. I see Minkowski’s endeavour as part of the Hilbertian program
for the axiomatization of physics. Hilbert had mentioned as candidates for axiomatization
limit processes and laws of motion for solid bodies in continua: it is precisely that kind of
problem that Minkowski had already tackled in a 1888 paper on “The Motion of a Solid
Body in a Liquid” (“Über die Bewegung eines festen Körpers in einer Flüssigkeit”) in the
line of Kirchoff’s work. His subsequent work on capillarity is a sequel to that ﬁrst work and
it is in 1907 paper mentioned above on “The fundamental equations for electromagnetic
processes in moving bodies” that he states his relativity theorem (Theorem der Relativität)
for the pure mathematical fact of the covariance of Lorentz transformations and then
proceeds to formulate his relativity principle in a canonical (axiomatic) fashion, for which
everything follows from the sole principle of the conservation of energy. In that paper,
Minkowski declares that
It is not a serious difﬁculty for the mathematician accustomed to n-dimensional manifolds and non-
Euclidean geometry to adapt the concept of time (as a fourth dimension) to the concrete Lorentz
transformations. (Minkowski 1967, II, p. 366, my translation).
This is in accordance with Einstein’s account of Special Relativity, Minkowski
concludes. Minkowski’s efforts in the axiomatization of physics are continued in the

5.13
Hermann Weyl and the Free-Will Theorem
101
paper on “The derivation of the fundamental equations for electromagnetic processes in
moving bodies from the point of view of the theory of the electron” (Minkowski 1967, II,
pp. 405–430). But that text had to be rewritten by Max Born on Hilbert’s invitation after
Minkowski’s death. Born says that he had to work with a hundred-page manuscript full of
formulas but with no helpful advice; needless to say, it is not a conclusive treatment of the
theory of electrons.
What philosophical conclusions can be drawn from my analysis? For the ontology of
space-time, a grid universe could be empty or devoid of any substance, or Substanz if we
want to use Minkowski’s word for matter. Substantial points or worldpoints constitute
worldlines which embrace the whole world, Minkowski insisted (Minkowski 1967 II,
434) and the universal validity of the world postulate points to the pre-established
harmony of pure mathematics and physics (Minkowski 1967, II, p. 444). Since the
postulate of the absolute world can be given a purely mathematical signiﬁcation in
virtue of its arithmetico-geometrical foundations, I would grant it, following Weyl, only
a transcendental status, that is the status of an a priori structure in the theoretical
construction of the world, as Weyl put it in his Philosophy of Mathematics and Natural
Science (Weyl 1960, p. 235). Minkowski diagrams belong to the analytical apparatus—der
analytische Apparat as Hilbert had termed it in his work on the foundations of Quantum
Mechanics. The diagrams do not belong to a model of the physical world. From that
standpoint, a realist interpretation of the Minkowskian world view is thereby excluded
on Minkowski’s own terms. Although Minkowski states that his intuitions of space and
time rest on the solid ground of experimental physics, their validity must be sought in the
mathematical justiﬁcation of the intuitive content. Behind or below the physical geometry,
“physikalische Geometrie”, as Helmholtz called it, lies a geometry of numbers, the heart
of which is arithmetic or number theory or simply number. Minkowski’s four-dimensional
manifold is an instance of the concept of n-dimensional manifold and the mathematician
has no problem in dealing—or toying, one might say—with that notion.
Weyl had of course novel ideas beyond Special and General Relativity theories and he
has emphasized the probabilistic world view of Quantum Mechanics. His idea in the 1920s
could indeed be seen as anticipating the free-will theorem of Conway and Kochen and also
the no-cloning philosophy in QM and multiverse cosmology.

Hermann Weyl and the Free-Will Theorem3
Hermann Weyl has defended a probabilistic approach to quantum physics as early as
1920. At the time (Weyl 1920), Weyl shared with the intuitionist Brouwer the idea that
the mathematical continuum was a process of becoming <ein Prozess im Werden> (Weyl
1918). For Weyl, the physical world is also in an inﬁnite process of becoming and the
notion of the end of time is only a limit idea <Grenzidee>. While the causal outlook

Arithmetical Foundations for Physical Theories
is bound to the eternal cycle of causal chains, the statistical or probabilistic view
privileges decisions that are autonomous and causally absolutely independent of each
other <selbständige, kausal voneinander absolut unabhängige Entscheidungen> (Weyl
1920, p. 541). Weyl adds that these <decisions> are the real ingredients of the world. The
causal static view describes only the world scene <Schauplatz>, not the real events (of the
statistical probabilistic worldview), Weyl concludes—see (Busek and Hillery 1996) for
Weyl’s view on the causal universe of Relativity Theory.
To me, Weyl’s foundational stance offers a strong supportive hypothesis to the Conway-
Kochen free will theorem and I would like to add a combinatorial probabilistic argument to
defend the idea. Weyl himself uses the binomial distribution (Weyl 1920, p. 539) to stress
the probabilistic independence of physical events and I shall use the argument against the
naïve thesis of a current cosmological view on inﬁnite worlds with inﬁnite reproduction of
true copies or doubles (or Doppelgänger)—Weyl had insisted on the one world of inﬁnitely
novel becoming. Let us start with the binomial distribution

Cantor has shown that all continua in any dimension are isomorphic, but Brouwer has
subsequently shown that they are not homeomorphic, that is the bijection is not continuous,
for example there is no continuous transformation between points on a circle and points on
a sphere. The argument shows that ﬁnite subsets are indistinguishable in the continuum;
in terms of measure-theoretic probability theory (Borel-Kolmogorov), they are negligible
or of measure zero, so that there is no inﬁnite reproduction of a ﬁnite conﬁguration
(combination) in an indeterministic universe. In a deterministic universe, eternal return
is possible only in a spatially ﬁnite world. Poincaré’s recurrence theorem states that an
isolated mechanical system will come back arbitrarily close to its initial state or conditions
in a universe of ﬁnite volume on an arbitrarily long temporal sequence (see Gauthier
2009a).
The combinatorial argument points to inﬁnististic hypotheses in contemporary physics,
from quantum theory (e.g. Everett’s multiverse theory) to cosmology (e.g. parallel
universes) as well as to logical or mathematical theories which postulate actual inﬁnities.

5.14
The Conway-Kochen Free-Will Theorem
103
In the case of Everett’s multiverse hypothesis, the fact there is no bijection between @0 and
2@0 can be invoked against the thesis of the universal ramiﬁcation of the wave function
in QM. The universal ramiﬁcation has 2@0 branches (the real or complex values of the
wave function). We assume that there are at most @0 observers in an inﬁnite multiverse,
otherwise there would be an instantaneous realization of the 2@0 values, which means
that measurement results would be indistinguishable and the universe (multiverse) would
be in all its states simultaneously (toto universo simul). Therefore no distinct (ﬁnite)
measurement results would be available to any local observer and this is sufﬁcient to
refute Everett’s thesis with the collateral thesis that the formalism generates its own
interpretation! From a quantum-thoretical probabilistic point of view, a single experiment
would deliver the inﬁnite decimal expansion of a real number in one blow—no need here
to pinpoint the inconsistency! Everett’s relative state formulation has been taken anew by
the physicist Carlo Rovelli (1996), but with the proviso that the new formulation takes into
account the relational structure between the measured system and the measuring system,
which I call the local observer (see Gauthier 1983a,b). My argument here is in accord
with Special Relativity where there are no simultaneous measurable events and also with
General Relativity since the invariant ds2 applies to cosmic events through the covariance
principle.
Hermann Weyl as a constructivist logician and mathematician who was also deeply
involved in physics and its philosophy could not conceive of the continuum, mathematical
or physical, as a static set-theoretic transﬁnite universe. This accords well with a ﬁnitistic
worldview which grants the physical world with a spontaneous self-determining becoming
or evolution as advocated in the Conway-Kochen proposal (Conway and Kochen 2006,
2009). The Conway-Kochen argument dispenses with probability or random processes;
for Weyl, the causal (deterministic) independence of decisions <Entscheidungen> is likely
indistinguishable from the statistical (stochastic) <indecisions> in the constructive theory
of a becoming continuum (Weyl 1920, p. 541) from the point of view of local observers
(see Gauthier 1983a,b).
5.14
The Conway-Kochen Free-Will Theorem
In their paper, Conway and Kochen (2009) quote Hermann Weyl’s saying: <The objective
world simply is, it does not happen> and reject this block-universe vision of an eternal
spacetime arena for General Relativity, but they neglect to add that Weyl mentions the
<gaze of consciousness> (Weyl 1963, 116) as the sequential order of events in the
transcendental world which is a physico-mathematical construction of our own. This
last view is certainly coherent with the free will idea that Conway and Kochen put forward
in their papers.
To make explicit their idea of free will in Quantum Mechanics, they have formulated
three axioms:
1. the SPIN axiom says that a triple experiment, that is an experiment in a three-axes x; y; z
coordinate system, yields the outcome 1; 0; 1 for spin-1 particles

104
5
Arithmetical Foundations for Physical Theories
2. the TWIN axiom asserts that spatially separated coupled spin-1 particles can give
the same answer when they are asked the same question as in the well-known EPR
experiment with the spin-1=2 statistics
ˆ D 1=
p
2Œ.'C ˝  C/ C .' ˝  /
3. ﬁnally, the FIN axiom states a causal antecedence (relativistic causality) of the source
of a signal over its reception.
The FIN axiom is put in a stronger form in Conway and Kochen (2009) under the name
MIN claiming that two experimenters exchanging on the 33 particular directions (with
40 triples x; y; z) of the Kochen-Specker coordinate frame for spin-1 particles are free
to pick any direction and any triple on their side of the exchange: the Strong Free Will
Theorem declares that the freedom of choice is not <a function of properties of that
part of the universe that is earlier than a response in this exchange with respect to any
initial frame of reference> (Conway and Kochen 2009, p. 228). Notice the ontological
import of the exchange process, since it is a spin-1 particle responding to the call, so
that if an experimenter is free to experiment or to set up an experiment, the <objects> of
the experiment, that is the particles experience an equal amount of freedom in such a
way that the independence of both outcome and set-up parameters is preserved. Conway
and Specker are clearly defending an objective realist interpretation of free will and if
experimenters (human, robotic or otherwise) have a share of that freedom, it is imparted
on them by Nature! This view is a far cry from Weyl’s transcendental standpoint, but is in
line with the assumed realism of the EPR experiment, the Bell theorem on non-contextual
local hidden-variable theories or Bohm’s version of QM and various no-go theorems in
QM. The question of determinism is at the philosophical center here and of course it is
not settled by the free will theorem, nevertheless there is an immediate proﬁt to be gained
by the foundational discussion and we can compare brieﬂy the Conway-Kochen way with
Weyl’s views in the ﬁrst section.
While Weyl puts the emphasis on the statistical worldview, Conway and Kochen insist
that they do not need any notion of probability or stochastic process to establish their
result. They argue for an overarching indeterminism that is grounded in the very nature
of the quantum-mechanical world. Weyl’s views in 1920 were expressed in the infancy
of quantum physics and although he had a clear understanding of the distinction between
causal and statistical theories, he did advocate the idea that decisions or free will choices
are autonomous and causally absolutely independent of each other and that they are
the real ingredients of the world in an everlasting process of becoming. This is, in my
opinion, in complete agreement with the Conway-Kochen ontological posture, but once
again one should not ignore that there is a deep philosophical divide between the two
positions. Let me emphasize the rôle that quantum logic has played in the evolution of
ideas in that context. Hermann Weyl was among the ﬁrst to advocate the concept of a
quantum logic that is at the heart of the contemporary debate. Gleason’s theorem on
the measure of closed subspaces of a Hilbert space and Kochen-Specker theorem on
the non-embeddability of the partial Boolean algebra of observables in a commutative
Boolean algebra can be seen as the ﬁnal blows on non-contextual hidden-variable theories;

5.15
A General No-Cloning Theorem in the Multiverse

those results among others belong to quantum logic and non-standard logic including
intuitionistic logic and maybe non-classical probability theory (see Nelson 1987a,b).
Surely, Conway and Kochen are not reluctant to consider logical issues, but they seem to be
more inclined to adopt a general philosophical perspective, maybe along Lucretius’poem
De rerum natura in which the Roman philosopher and disciple of Epicurus defends the
idea that man’s free will is deducible from free will in nature through the <clinamen>, the
deviation or declination of particles (or atoms for Lucretius) in the void of the universe or
universes, since Lucretius proclaims a multiplicity of universes in an inﬁnite world much
in the spirit of multiverse theory.
5.15
A General No-Cloning Theorem in the Multiversal
Cosmology
There is strong analogy between the Conway-Kochen theorem and the general no-
cloning proposal: both have to do with the non-reproducibility of measurements and their
outcomes in an indeterministic setting. But there is also a deep difference between the two
for free will cannot be demonstrated mathematically, while the general no-cloning theorem
has a rigorous mathematical proof based on set theory and algebraic topology. Let us begin
with some preliminaries.
5.15.1
The No-Cloning Theorem in QM
The argument for the no-cloning theorem in QM goes back to the papers of Wootters and
Zurek (1982) and Diecks (1982). The fundamental idea is quite simple: a single quantum
(or quantum state) cannot be cloned. Wooters and Zurek even question the very notion of
quantum state (Wootters and Zurek 2009). One singles out an arbitrary state and shows
that due to the time evolution operator and linearity and unitarity (bounded linearity)
conditions, all states—for the single-out state is arbitrary—cannot be cloned in a copy-
multiplier experiment. Quantum Mechanics is couched in an inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert
in a second-order language whose cardinality is 2@0 in the set-theoretic idiom. Inﬁnite-
dimensional means @0 dimensions, that is the countable inﬁnity of the set N of positive
integers—2@0 is uncountable and it corresponds to the set R of real numbers. There is
no bijection between @0 and 2@0 which is also the power set of @0. It is in that context
that Cantor formulated his Continuum Hypothesis as stated above in section 1. The ﬁrst
occurrence of the continuum Hypothesis appears in a 1878 paper <Contributions to the
theory of multiplicities (manifolds)> (Cantor 1966, pp. 119–133) in which Cantor attempts
to prove that all continuous manifolds are of the same denumerable dimension using the
concept of the uncountable cardinality (Mächtigkeit) of the reals 2@0. In a subsequent paper
<On a proposition in the theory of continuous manifolds> (Cantor 1966, pp. 134–138),
Cantor gives a defective proof that all continua are of the same dimension, this time using

106
5
Arithmetical Foundations for Physical Theories
the Riemannian notion of a multivalued function. One has to wait till Brouwer’s papers
in 1910 and the following years (Brouwer 1912a,b) to get the right concept: continua
of different dimension might be isomorphic (have the same cardinality), but they cannot
be homeomorphic. It is in his 1910 paper <Proof of the invariance of the dimension
number> that Brouwer proves the following statement:
An m-dimensional manifold cannot contain a one-to-one continuous function of a domain of a
greater dimension number. (My translation of Brouwer 1910, p. 165)
The same is true for l < m and this means that there is homeomorphism or a bicontinu-
ous mapping between manifolds of different dimension. Brouwer uses various concepts
like simplicial maps and the ﬁxed-point theorem. In particular, Brouwer’s ﬁxed-point
theorem was inspired by Kronecker’s notion of the winding number <Windungszahl> or
indicatrix. The ﬁxed-point theorem states that a one-to-one continuous transformation of
an n-dimensional element in itself posesses a ﬁxed point; in contemporary idiom, the
indicatrix is called an index or a topological degree for a continuous function to itself
on the closed unit ball Dn such that it has at least one ﬁxed point (see Gauthier 2009b). In
the language of general (set-theoretic) topology, Brouwer’s proof says simply that if U is
an open subset of a Euclidean space Rn and we have an injective map f W U ! Rn, then
the image of f.U/ is open and homeomorphic: Rn is not homeomorphic to Rm if m ¤ n.
I use those notions to formulate a general theorem to the effect that there cannot be
exact copies of elements (states, objects or persons) that could be clones or doppelgangers
in an inﬁnite multiverse. There are cosmologists like A. Vilenkin (see 2006 and 2010)
and string theorists like B. Greene who would be inclined to think that there is an exact
reproduction of states of affairs in an inﬁnite universe of ﬁnite (or inﬁnite) dimension. The
following theorem shows that it cannot be the case (see Gauthier 2013b).
5.15.2
A No-Cloning Theorem in the Multiverse Cosmology
I state now the main argument as the following:
Theorem.
In an n-dimensional inﬁnite universe, there cannot be an exact reproduction or homomorphic
images of items (ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite) in any ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite @0 subuniverse
of the uncountable multiverse of the power of the continuum.
Proof. We take the notion of multiverse in its original sense of Everett’s many-universe
interpretation of QM—as the universal ramiﬁcation of the wave function—but the notion
excludes any ﬁnite renormalizable cosmological theory like herotetic string theory in
10, 11 or 26 dimensions even with at least 10500 universes attempting a uniﬁcation of
cosmology or General Relativity with Quantum Mechanics. The most general setting is
set-theoretic combinatorial: an arbitrary subset X of a countably inﬁnite set @0 is included
in the power set of that set, that is
X  P.X/

5.15
A General No-Cloning Theorem in the Multiverse
107
and by the Cantor theorem on cardinalities
8X .card X < card P.X//
Recall that the power set 2n, the set of all the subsets of a given set n, represents all the
combinations C of the elements or members of the set, as in the binomial theorem used by
Weyl (see above) in his probabilistic picture of a universe in a process of inﬁnite becoming.
There is no bijection between @0 and P.@0/ and a fortiori there in no continuous bijection
between an arbitrary subset (subuniverse) and the multiverse or between of a ﬁnite
member of a (countable) subuniverse and the (uncountably) superuniverse. Turning to the
topological setting, we have topological spaces (manifolds) which are locally Euclidean
Rn to refer to Cantor’s original faulty argument; here we deal with homeomorphic images
and since Brouwer’s proof on the invariance of the dimension number works for open
sets and the system of their neighbourhoods, the argument is straightforward: there is no
homeomorphic image of an n-universe to an m-universe for m ¤ n. We can still specify
our argument to metric topological spaces, for example a Hilbert space which is also a
Banach space where we have the open mapping theorem which sends open sets to open
sets between Banach spaces. Moreover, the sequence of linear subspaces of a Banach
space has a local open complement by the following argument:
Let B be an n-dimensional Banach space and let F? be the sequence of closed linear
manifolds or subspaces F? of B . Set F? D F, the closure of all F?. The local
complement FC of F such that
F? D FC  F
is an open subset of B. If we take a locally convex space as the space B, the sequence G
of open subsets g containing a neigbourhood of each of their points admits readily a local
complement which is also open (by locality), since the metric complement
A  fx W x 2 X; .x; A/ > 0g
of a located subset A, i.e.
.x; A/  inff.x; y/ W y 2 Ag
(if this distance from x to A exists 8x 2 X ) is open, for we have
.x; A/ 
 .x; y/ C .x; A/ .8y 2 A/
(see Bishop 1967 for the notion of located subset). A still more special case can be
obtained, if we restrict ourselves to a ﬁxed point and a local homeomorphism, a ﬁber in
the language of sheaves, deﬁned by the restriction on a function f W X ! Y for topological
spaces X and Y with
fjX W X ! f.X/

108

Arithmetical Foundations for Physical Theories
and the inverse image f 1.y/ for y
2
Y. Here again we have an open set (and
neighbourhoods) and it is only that in spaces of the same dimension that this obtains,
since as Brouwer’s theorem shows that for spaces of different dimensions n ¤ m, there is
no homeomorphic image (or open map) in the neighbourhood of an open set in a Banach
space, even at inﬁnitesimal distance .
Although Brouwer’s ﬁxed point theorem is notably non-constructive, there are con-
structive versions which are approximations or approximative of the ﬁxed-point theorem.
Our own version of Bishop’s located subset provides with a local ﬁxed point which
accentuates the impossibility of a <proximate> cloning in a multidimensional universe.
One should not forget in that context that the origin of the ﬁxed-point theorem is to be
found in Kronecker’s notion of the winding number (Windungszahl) which he introduced
in his 1869 work on functions of several variables. In algebraic topology, the winding
number is called an index or a topological degree for a continuous function to itself on the
closed unit ball Dn; the winding number is generated by a ﬁnite iteration of the progression
principle (Fortgangsprinzip) for closed curves. The notion is central to (constructive)
approximation theory as it deals essentially with approximating polynomials. Even though
our result looks non-constructive at ﬁrst sight since it is based on set-theoretic concepts,
it is constructively justiﬁed insofar as it deals with inﬁnite totalities that are subjected to
a combinatorial procedure deﬁned in the ﬁnite, that is the power set of a given ﬁnite set.
The non-constructive burden rests on those who believe in the existence of inﬁnite sets and
the applicability of the power set to those transcendental powers: : : Of course, the result
obtained above is independent of the continuum hypothesis which is nowadays believed to
be false (by Woodin and alli). Our result depends only on the combinatorial content of the
power set of any inﬁnite set of cardinality @0.
The immediate effect of that result is that there cannot be any reduplication of an
open map in manifolds of dimensions n > 1 and a particle cannot meet its exact
double in the free world of the multiverse! In QM, the phenomenon of entanglement
of states is invoked, but our result is equally valid for disentangled dual states—duality
is not an internal mathematical property in Banach spaces, nor an intrinsic feature of
the physical world. The ontological indiscernability principle of Leibnizian inspiration
and reduced to the statistical principle of invariance permutation by van Fraassen in the
quantum-mechanical context (see for example van Fraassen 1991, Chap. 11) is used to the
same effect and is thereby included in the no-cloning theorem which could be termed
the homeomorphic indiscernability principle, since it is a domain invariance theorem
and not a simple state invariance condition. Our result also strengthens the no-cloning
theorem in QM and imposes also limitations on approximate clonings as in the paper of
Busek and Hillery (1996) in which they imagine copying states in the (undeﬁned) neigh-
bourhood of a given state or hyperinstances or almost exact copies in multidimensional
cosmology. For supersymmetric theories, one should remember that homeomorphisms
and diffeomorphisms reduce to automorphisms in spaces of the same dimension and
should not expect superpartners at near range or in a nearby dimension. The no-cloning
idea applies equally to the <transdimensional> cosmology suggested by Vilenkin and
others in the measure problem of the multiverse, since the essential use of the notion of
hypersurface refers to an m-dimensional manifold with an m-1 dimensional submanifold

5.15
A General No-Cloning Theorem in the Multiverse
109
in differential topology. And again from the point of view of the combinatorial topology
of knot theory, higher-dimensional knots become n-dimensional spheres emerging from
an m-dimensional Euclidean space and thus losing their homeomorphic images as untied
strings or loose loops: : :
From a geometrical point of view, this result is in accordance with Poincaré conjecture
(solved by Perelman) on the homeomorphism between simply connected, closed 3-
manifolds to the 3-sphere, since they are of the same dimension for all integers n; ﬁxed
points are present in the Riemann surface of the Thurston geometrization conjecture which
inspired Perelman and such manifolds are also homotopy equivalent, but homeomorphy
is not reducible to homotopy. Incidentally, it is the polynomial constitution of the moduli
space—as objects in a Grothendieck scheme—of a Riemann surface that earned a Fields
medal in 2014 to the Iranian Maryam Mirzhakani, the ﬁrst woman ever to win the prize.
Homotopy equivalence comes down to identity and indiscernability, which means that
homotopy morphisms are coarser than homeomorphisms and they trespass dimensional
frontiers, for homotopy equivalence becomes weaker in inﬁnite dimensions! Here ﬁbers
from ﬁber bundles as surjections on the same space come into play, but ﬁbrations as
generalized ﬁbers can go across borders and build a common path between different
spaces or spaces of different dimensions. This is why the common path of homotopy
theory becomes narrower in an inﬁnite dimension. From a cosmological point of view,
supersymmetry theories introduce superpartners of elementary particles like the selectron
for the electron or the fotino for the photon which cannot replicate exactly the original
particles for they would have to transfer their quantum numbers over dimensions with non-
homeomorphic consequences...Indeed, in the abstract framework of anabelian geometry
conjectured by Grothendieck and pursued by Mochizuki in his inter-universal geometry,
the inﬁnite multiverse has no commutative subsets, since all sit far and apart from an
abelian nuclear group. But how could those specimens of a non-commutative species
(Mochizuki’s idiom) could reassemble in a set-theoretic superuniverse under the leading
of an inaccessible cardinal, as Mochizuki suggests, is a very open question.
In any case, our general no-cloning theorem stated above supersedes other theorems on
no-cloning. Take for example Lindblad’s (1999) on the operator algebra of observables in
the Hilbert space of QM or Barnum et alii result on the no-broadcasting of exact copies
of mixed states from the information-theoretic viewpoint; those results are limited to the
quantum-mechanicalscene. Even the more ambitious (and most problematic) <constructor
theory> of D. Deutsch et alii aiming at a uniﬁed theory of Quantum Mechanics and
General Relativity cannot account for the most general no-cloning setting. In both cases,
a superﬂuous objectivist ontology does not make place for the local observer, the real
informant or the only <constructor>, the outsider in the observable scene (Lindblad 1999).
In the quantum-mechanical context, an inﬁnite-dimensional (of cardinal @0 and ordinal
!) Hilbert space has 2@0 states inhabited by real numbers, all distinct between them.
In the abstract category-theoretic framework of dagged categories—categories with an
involution—one can reproduce the no-cloning result in compact spaces of the same
dimension for ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, but not for inﬁnite-dimensional ones.
And ﬁnally, in the most general combinatorial set-theoretic setting, the subsets of @0
form a totality 2@0 of distinct combinations. Let us remark that the general no-cloning
or no-homeomorphism theorem applies equally to abstract theories of sets, types, classes,

110

Arithmetical Foundations for Physical Theories
categories and topoi where are involved many universes or multiverses of higher transﬁnite
dimensions; it is also valid for anabelian higher-dimensional algebraic varieties in the
sense of Grothendieck or anabelian inter-universal geometry in the sense of Mochizuki!
If we come down to ﬁnite dimensions, algebraic topology with Brouwer’s result teaches
us that there is no transdimensional identity (even with Poincaré recurrence in a ﬁnite
volume). Here approximations accentuate distinctions and indiscernability comes down to
unique identity, which means that there cannot be clones of exact status in any universe
or multiverse of different dimension. The lesson that could be drawn here is maybe that
if you have to live an eternal life (before and after forever), you will never (have been) be
exactly the same self. This lesson should not however be considered as a plea for a theory
of multiple reincarnation!
From the perspective of the local observer (Gauthier 1983a,b), the cosmological
holographic principle (introduced by Gerhard ’t Hooft among others) which reduces
the dimensions of the multiverse to a two-dimensional surface is certainly compatible
with our result, since everything happens outside the local observer and the physical
universe appears as a homeomorphic image to the same local observer. That the two-
dimensional image or information is a projection of a three-dimensional spatial structure
or form forbids any homeomorphic transmission of information to the local observer
who lives in a three-dimensional world, but the local observer qua observer is indifferent
to dimensions, it is a zero-dimensional observer. Put differently, the local observer is a
ﬁxed-point observer in interaction with the observable universe. Otherwise, the highly
speculative theory of eternal and inﬁnite observers is not immune to serious foundational
criticisms and even though string theory (superstring or M-theory in 11 dimensions) is a
viable theory as a ﬁnitary renormalizable theory, it should be free of doppelgängers or
ghost observers: : : The philosophical shortcomings of cosmologists and string theorists
are no excuse when it comes to logico-mathematical foundations.
The general result is congenial to Weyl’s views on the ever-becoming world and
Brouwer’s idea of the (mathematical) continuum as a process. In the classical Can-
torian view, the continuum is made of uncountable distinct real numbers, while in
the Brouwerian-Weylian view the continuum as an ever-becoming process is made of
indistinguishable elementary processes. In both cases, as we have seen, there is no
exact reproduction or copying of arbitrary individuals, may they be items of a countably
inﬁnite species, animal, human, robotic, alien or supernatural, entities, Lebnizian monads,
Nietzschean <cyclists> in an inﬁnite return or physical objects in general in an inﬁnite-
dimensional universe. It may seem that the modern cosmologists who speculate on inﬁnite
copies of the same make the error of thinking that there is only a ﬁnite number of
combinations or subsets in an inﬁnite set (universe). The French writer Auguste Blanqui
believed so in his 1872 book L’éternité par les astres and concluded that there was an
inﬁnite number of duplicates of himself in an eternal and inﬁnite universe. Blanqui was
also a revolutionary and the fact that he was imprisoned at the time of his writing probably
led him to imagine inﬁnite possibilities under ﬁnite circumstances! But speculations of the
kind are not rare though among thinkers and writers, from the Presocratic philosophers to
Giordano Bruno, Fontenelle and Edgar Allan Poe and they are not all devoid of interest.
Our result is also compatible with the Conway-Kochen free will approach for even in the
absence of time, particles have the choice of a countable inﬁnity of directions and not just

5.16

111
the 33 directions of the triple x; y; z experiment—of course an actual experiment requires
time and is limited to a ﬁnite number of decisions, as Weyl puts it. Those decisions take
1=10 of a second for human experimenters as Conway and Kochen admit (2006, p. 1142),
but they also take place in Weyl’s transcendental (a priori) time for observers. From an
information-theoretic point of view, transmission of signals also takes time and there is
a limit above, may it be the speed of light or more generally causal antecedence of the
emission of a signal over its reception and this also can be accounted for in a non-realist
constructivist way as the transcendental channel of intersubjective communication that can
even be quantiﬁed—counting is an objective activity of a free agent...
As far as the philosophy of free will is concerned, our result means that the question
is not of ontological import, as Conway and Kochen claim in their realistic posture, but is
essentially of a constructivist nature, as Weyl describes (1963 and 1968) the theoretical or
symbolic construction of the world in physico-mathematical terms.

The consistency problem for physical theories raised by Hilbert in his axiomatization
programme has taken a new turn in recent years with the renormalization idea. Consistent
theories in quantum ﬁeld theories and the theories of critical phenomena must be
renormalizable, that is they have to remove their inﬁnities or their divergences in order
to be granted a physical meaning as theories of ﬁnite measurable quantities. The two
cases of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)—
for the uniﬁed theory of the electroweak ﬁeld—are exemplary. Here the consistency
question could be termed <external> in the sense that the procedures of renormalization
(and regularization) are applied to the mathematical or analytical apparatus of a physical
theory and are meant to get rid of inconsistencies and anomalies (inﬁnite divergences).
In this way, F. Dyson a pioneer in the renormalization programme made the distinction
between an ideal observer capable of inﬁnite precision and the real observer limited to
ﬁnite measurements. Others, like J. Schwinger separate the dynamical variables at the
mathematical level of a theory from the observed particles at the physical level. Dirac and
Feynman expressed serious doubts about the relevance of renormalization, but subsequent
work by K.G. Wilson, M. Veltman and G. ’t Hooft among others have introduced new
techniques for renormalization that proved successful (see Gauthier 2002, Chap. 6). But
one should not hide the fact that the renormalization procedures are somewhat artiﬁcial
as they consist in simply cutting off divergences or substract inﬁnite quantities and
make the theory ﬁt for ﬁnite measurements while at the same time using inﬁnitary
mathematical tools like analytic continuation in the toolbox of classical mathematics (and
physics)—for the Hamiltonian and the Lagrancian formalisms. This means that there is
no overt constructive aim in the renormalization process, only a pragmatic goal and the
<physical logic> or physical axiomatics that Hilbert had in view is not practicable to
its full extent in physical theories. The <consistent histories> approach of Gellmann and
Hartle does not fare better as far as <internal> consistency is concerned, since it does
suppose an objective decoherence of superpositions of states, so as to make the theory

Arithmetical Foundations for Physical Theories
consistent and the physical world coherent before the Schrödinger wave even reaches any
measurement apparatus, as if quantum-mechanical (and cosmological) probable histories
were predetermined or predestined by Nature or some other metaphysical entity. Theories
renormalizable from the start, like string theory, might be more likely candidates for
constructivization, since they are ﬁnitely generated from discrete objects and not from
point-like particles. In any event, internal consistency as we have it in mathematical or
logical theories is not yet available for physical theories and the external consistency of
renormalization is only from the outside, not the inner consistency that Hilbert hoped for
his metamathematical programme of ﬁnitist proof theory in the foundations of logic and
arithmetic and by extension of the whole of mathematics.
On the proper pragmatic side of the consistency question, one should emphasize the
interaction between the analytical apparatus and the experimental apparatus, if a coherent
philosophy of physics is desired. Experimental physics depend upon theoretical physics
to probe physical facts and achieve precision measurements. Technology itself, e.g. the
laser apparatus, telescopes or laboratories like CERN, is aimed at conﬁrming or inﬁrming
models of theories while the statistics of measurement are not always adequate—the
Opera faster-than-light neutrino programme failed, but the Higgs apparently succeeded—
till further test and testimony beyond the mass of 125 GeV. And black holes might not exist
after all as witting white holes with no loss of information, at least without wormholes
and other serpentine or stringy creatures—one might say in French that these are indeed
 de troublants trous blancs ! Conservation of information is the issue here and
since entropy is a local phenomenon, an open universe, cyclic or bouncing or inﬁnite
in both or all directions would not suffer from any loss of information, which is just an
other form for energy, energy being itself in any kinematical or thermodynamical form in
action—for those notions, see Gauthier (2009a). The postulated gravitational waves have
been dusted by a Planck experiment in recent observations, but they do not conﬁrm a
deﬁnite cosmological model, may it be inﬂation (eternal or not), a multiverse scenario in
principle unobservable or a string theory alternative with as many possible models as a
consistent ﬁnitely renormalizable theory permits. The most precise measurements of our
own inﬂationary universe seem to indicate that the observable cosmos is very ﬂat (not
fat!) with a corresponding Euclidean model and our best experimental theory, quantum
electrodynamics (QED), requires ﬁfteen decimals for the tuning of the ﬁne structure
constant of the electron.
What this means is also that discoveries are not haphazardly or by happenstance,
experimental physicists ﬁnd what they are looking for being guided by theories and their
models, but they rarely ﬁnd it, statistically speaking. And statistics themselves have to be
as reﬁned as the observation apparatuses are ﬁne-tuned to precision measurements, in the
lab or in the outer world (within ﬁve sigma, that is 99.9999% in terms of the standard
deviation). There again, a physical phenomenon, may it be a quantum-mechanical one or a
relativistic (special or general) is subjected to the interaction between the observed (small
or large scaled) and the observer, who is always local. That interaction can be subsumed
under a quadratic polynomial in the internal logic which assigns a rôle and a locus or a
place to the local observer of the observable world in the binomial combination observed-
observer.

But how far can one (the local observer) see beyond the event horizon of a black hole
or the Big Bang as a singular black hole? Only the theoretical eye can fathom the outer
worlds and it is on the ultimate ﬂuctuating vacuum ﬁeld, the physical counterpart of the
chaotic tohu-wa-bohu of the Bible or the Tiamat of the Babylonians, that the universal
or multiversal observer comes to rest in the search of a global vision, a uniﬁed theory
of everything. In this quest, physics takes the place of ancient religions and obsolete
metaphysics in order to make sense of it all in the terms of science. That does not mean
however that the ﬁeld of vision is devoid of any unphysical impurity and that speculative
research can totally obviate ﬁctional dreams and inconsistent views. There is always the
sanction of empirical veriﬁcation, but it is not possible in all interesting cases, e.g. string
theory still awaiting to go beyond the Higgs ﬁeld and see the larger multidimensional
picture of a supersymmetric universe. Here again the horizon is receding and any original
account or ﬁnal story of the origin and the end is an unending tale that will remain to be
told.

Principles for a Theory of Measurement in QM
1. Principle of denumerability (or distinguishability) for results; measurement results must
be distinguishable from one another (ﬁnitely or at most with the limit cardinality @0).
2. Quantum states could be indistinguishable in the wave function  which represents the
probability density as a continuum (of cardinality 2@0)—here the experimental setting
or apparatus is needed to obtain a ﬁnite measurement result.
3. A measurement result must be realized in order to count as a measurement (in a
successful experiment in an experimental setting).
4. An ideal measurement result is not a real result and although it could be integrated to a
thought experiment, it must also be denumerable or distinguishable.
5. There is no bijection between @0 and 2@0.
6. The combinatorial theory of measurements forbids any simultaneous measurement
giving for an @0 universe 2@0 measurement results which would be indistinguishable,
in other words, all possible states of the system would be realized at the same time
or simultaneously, the system would be in all its states <simul> and this would make
impossible any single measurement with discrete values of a given state of the system.
Those principles are the foundations of a measurement theory for QM and they allow
for a probability theory à la Kolmogorov compatible with a QM where Schrödinger’s
wave function describes the time evolution of a quantum system and where Heisenberg’s
indeterminacy relations deﬁne the parameters of a denumerable probability theory in
agreement with the constructivist theory stipulating that a quantum phenomenon is an
interactive process between an observed system and an observer (observing system or
apparatus). There follows Bohr’s complementarity thesis between the causal and the
spatiotemporal descriptions for QM. The internal logic of QM calls here for a pseudo-
boolean logic where the observer occupies the position of a relative or local complement

in a measurement experiment as expressed in the following formula:
a ! b D In..X  a/ [ b/
which can be transformed into a modular polynomial expression as I show in Chap. 7.
Admittedly, no-go theorems for hidden variable theories in QM like Gleason, Bell,
Kochen-Specker and Conway-Kochen theorems designed for ideal measurements (in the
analytical apparatus) are valid in the theoretical framework and the recent work of Meyer,
Kent and others on the ﬁnite precision loophole in quantum information theory do not
invalidate them. The ﬁnite precision requirement is still a theoretical constraint and does
not apply to concrete measurements, since real measurements by a local observer are
always ﬁnite and precision is realized through ﬁnite approximations closing effectively
any measurement loophole numerically. Again, the internal physical logic points to an
arithmetical foundation not only of the analytical apparatus, but also of the experimental
apparatus in the same measure.
Along those lines, the recent attempt by Couder, Fort and others to draw a
hydrodynamic picture of the quantum-mechanical world has resulted only in a surface
analogy (or a toy model) of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave deterministic interpretation
of orthodox QM; the de Broglie-Bohm theory is not naturally Lorentz invariant and it
doesn’t modify the standard statisticical measurement theory of an essentially stochastic
quantum regime, it only superposes a macroscopic analogue of a supposedly causal
(deterministic) substratum or subquantum world. We know that work on hydrodynamics
in the 18th century gave rise to partial differential equations and subsequently to Navier-
Stokes equations for ﬂuid dynamics on the model of classical mechanics. Apparently,
this is the physico-mathematical background of Couder’s enterprise. Couder’s water or
oil drop experiments with an artiﬁcial zitterbewegung seem to point to a nonlocal hidden-
variable theory overriding relativistic constraints of parameter independence or outcome
independence or both for spatially separated and correlated systems in line with Bell’s
theorem and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment in the reformulation of
Bohm, as discussed above. More importantly though, any hidden-variable theory faces the
bijection problem @0 ½ 2@0 for quantum states and their measurement, a paradox that
affects Everett’s multiverse interpretation as well as any hidden-variable theory in QM,
relativistic as non-relativistic alike.
It is clear that the macroscopic picture cannot recapture the quantum-mechanical
behaviour beyond the classical limit or below the quantum limit. Here in the unobservable
(meta of infra-physical) underworld, there is no place for observers, nor for measurement.
Indeed, all this is a far cry from the analytical apparatus of QM with its usual Hilbert
space formalism (with possible substitutes like the C von Neumann algebras or Connes’
non commutative analysis or even string and M-brane theory), but that does not mean
that graphical analogies or pictorial analogues cannot be useful, for example as aids in
thought experiments, for instance the classical <Gedankenexperimente> from Zeno to
Galileo, Newton, Einstein and Schrödinger among many others. I give here a simple
illustration of my own for the derivation of the main formulas of Special Relativity with the
Pythagorean theorem as the sole tool from the analytical apparatus and the two postulates
of SR, Galilean relativity or inertia principle and the constancy of the velocity of light c in

to call it :
The sailboat moves with velocity v and l is the length or height of the (stationary) mast
MN. A light signal is sent from a source L to N when the boat is at rest and is sent down to
O with ct0 the distance traveled by the light signal when the boat is traveling the distance
vt0 between the points M and O. We take ct0 as the hypothenuse of this square rectangle
and we get the following derivation from the Pythagorean theorem : c2 D a2 C b2 with
sides a and b and hypotenuse c.

The sailboat of time seems to be a reﬂection of the relativity of simultaneity as it drifts
silently on a uniform sea under a starlight signal ﬂowing down from the canopy of heaven!
This seems to be a nice thought experiment compared to Einstein’s horseback riding a
light beam as he imagined himself in his 1905 paper on the electrodynamics of moving
bodies. In both cases though, the sailer and the rider, there is an observer aboard! The
ﬁnal outcome is that Relativity Theory (Special and General) and Quantum Mechanics
are observer dependent and cannot do without the measurement of an observable
universe. There is no doubt that beyond the observable universe, measurement takes
on a new meaning and inevitably cosmological hypotheses (eternal inﬂation, ekpyrotic
or cyclic universes, homogeneous or heterogeneous multiverses) or uniﬁed theories of
General Relativity and Quantum Gravity border on metaphysical speculations and some
hypothetical anthropic principle must sometimes come to the rescue to save the phenomena
in a soft atonement like ﬁne tuning; the detour is needed for the task of measuring the

apparently immeasurable, if only by indirect means like the CMB (Cosmic Background
Radiation) or other tracking devices that can only register traces of the unobservable. The
frontiers of the observable are those that are traced above and below by the grand uniﬁed
theories (GUTs) that hope to link gravitation (General Relativity or alternative theories
like loop quantum gravity) with the electromagnetic, weak and strong ﬁelds (Quantum
Mechanics). For cosmology, the limit is the standard model of the Big Bang with or
without inﬂation beyond the singularity, for particle physics, the frontier is below the
Higgs bosons at 125 GeV/c2. In both cases, new physics looms large on the observable
horizon (and far beyond) to absorb dark matter or energy, supersymmetric partners or
exotic particles even parallel universes to supplement or complement the local observable
landscape. In the no man’s land of the unobservable, string theory seems to be the
proximate probe to explore the terra incognita. Strings, superstrings or M-branes need to
have “all strings attached” to cope with the physical continuum which can be considered as
a combinatorial superstructure of discrete units (ﬁnite strings with the minimal length ls of
1034 m) that need to be stuck together in accordance with our view of an evolving, chaotic
universe described earlier. In that sense, the physical continuum is not different from the
mathematical continuum, if as H. Weyl envisioned, even the mathematical continuum is
nowhere and never a completed totality from a constructivist viewpoint. The continuum is
ﬁlling up all the time, since it is a combinatorial process in motion or a process in becoming
<ein Prozess im Werden>, as Brouwer would have it. The local observer still remains
unique in his capacity to combine cosmos and chaos in the ﬁnite polynomial equations that
puts him ahead of the broken order of a hidden and fearful symmetry (or supersymmetry!),
knowing that his own location qua observer is at the center of the observable universe or
of any universe. As a local gauge, if one may say, the (theoretical) observer is absolutely
stable in a thermodynamical instable or metastable universe insofar as any quantum ﬁeld,
including any hypothetical ﬁeld beyond the Higgs ﬁeld of the Standard Model, must
preserve symmetry above or below any spontaneous symmetry breaking for the sake of
a consistent model of the persistence of the universe(s). The local observer literally sees
worlds revolving around him as if they were immersed in the sphere containing all things,
as the Ancients thought.
Physical logic or the logic of physics, from quantum logic to cosmological logic or
cosmologic as a true universal logic, that is the logic of the cosmos, the universe or the
multiverse also rests on the ﬁrm ground of arithmetical logic to the extent that the ﬁxed-
point observer is the one who measures all things, as Pythagoras proclaimed, and is at the
center of it all.

Transcendental Versus Elementary: The Gel’fond-Schneider
Theorem
Mathematical constructivism could be summarized by the phrase: “Arithmetical state-
ments proven by analytical means can be proven without them, that is by elementary
non-analytical means”. Herbrand expressed the idea clearly in the 1920s. It was repeated
recently by H. Friedman, following Avigad (2003). The classical example in this con-
nection is Dirichlet who proved in 1837 the prime number theorem and the theorem on
arithmetical progressions by analytical means; the elementary proofs were provided only
in 1949 by Selberg and Erdös. A less known example is the 1933 Gel’fond-Schneider
theorem for which Gel’fond gave a constructive version in the 1960s. I give here a brief
account of the theorem and its foundational implications.

Transcendental Number Theory
To illustrate the excluded middle principle of classical logic, Dummett (2000, p. 6) cites
the well-known example of a theorem in classical logic which gives a rational solution to
two irrational numbers xy:
There are solutions of xy D z with x and y irrational and z rational. Take

be proven or instantiated (as for the existential quantiﬁer). Of course, we know now that
p
2
p
2 is irrational and even transcendental, due to the Gel’fond-Schneider theorem: here
an intuitionist logician like A.S. Troelstra (2003) (see his Proof theory and Constructivism)
is content to say that there is a constructive proof and simply refers to the Gel’fond-
Schneider theorem without further comment!
The Gel’fond-Schneider theorem (1934) is a solution to Hilbert’s 7th problem:
For ˛ and ˇ algebraic numbers with ˛ ¤ 0; 1 and ˇ irrational, ˛ˇ is transcendental.
Schneider (1934a,b) puts the problem in the form:
For ! an algebraic number ¤ 0; 1 and  irrational, ! is transcendental with  D log =log ! for
 D !.
The proof proceeds by logarithmic approximations to algebraic numbers and concludes
that any logarithm of an algebraic number with an algebraic base must be a transcendental
or a rational number. By reductio ad absurdum, ! is transcendental. With a similar
procedure, Gel’fond (1934) comes to the conclusion that the logarithms of algebraic
numbers with an algebraic base are transcendental or rational numbers.
Both proofs are (partially) constructive in the sense that they extract arithmetical content
(that is logarithmic approximations, minorizations and majorizations, effective bounds,
etc.) from analytical methods (inﬁnite series or power series, periodic functions, etc.); they
use polynomial inequalities for the rational values of an analytic function f.x/ and end up
by contradicting an assumption to the effect that ﬁnite values make it vanish identically
f.x/ D 0.
Baker (1975) extended and generalized those results in transcendental number theory
using auxiliary functions or polynomials—which he calls fundamental polynomials—
linear forms and logarithms for approximations of algebraic numbers in order to establish
algebraic independence by contradiction or reductio ad absurdum.
It is only in 1962 that Gel’fond produced an elementary (constructive) proof for real
algebraic numbers !, a > 0, b for e! with e the base of natural logarithms and ab (see
Gel’fond and Linnik 1965, Chap. 12). Gel’fond relates that he used only Rolle’s theorem as
an analytical tool—here a radical constructivist could mention that a constructive version
of Rolle’s theorem is to be found in Bishop (1967). Essentially, Rolle’s theorem says
classically that a continuous function of a real variable on Œa; b with f.a/ D f.b/ for
a < b has a derivative f 0.c/ D 0. Bishop’s constructive version introduces jf 0.x/j 
 
with  > 0 for moduli of continuity of f 0 and differentiability of f. In other words, Bishop
deﬁnes more precisely the limits of the real interval Œa; b much in the manner of Kronecker
for Bolzano’s theorem on intermediate values (see Gauthier 2002). Bishop has admitted
(Bishop 1970) that his foundational project was closer to Kronecker’s ﬁnitist programme
than to Brouwer’s intuitionism.
However, Gel’fond’s work is in analytic number theory and constructive number theory,
not in constructive analysis. His results in transcendental number theory are algebraic
in nature. The main theorem in Gel’fond and Linnik (1965, Chap. 12) states that « if
! ¤ 0 is an algebraic real, than e! is not algebraic » and is couched in the language of
algebraic integers in ﬁnite ﬁelds. A ﬁnite ﬁeld is also the arena for an another elementary
proof (Gel’fond and Linnik 1965, Chap. 10), Hasse’s theorem on integral solutions for the

6.2

119
equation :
y2  x3 C ax C b .mod p/
for integers a, b and a prime p > 3. Gel’fond formulates his solution in terms of an
inequality
jN  pj < 2pp
where N is the number of integral solutions of the equation. Here, the language used
is the language of polynomials and divisors with an algebro-geometric interpretation
and Gel’fond quotes a major result of André Weil on Riemann’s hypothesis in function
ﬁelds (see Weil 1941). Weil’s result is a special case of the Riemann hypothesis for
quadratic ﬁnite ﬁelds (with a ﬁnite number of elements or points on a projective surface)
and Weil claims that his result is free of the transcendental (analytic) theory. The main
arithmetical tool here is the theory of forms or homogeneous polynomials. That theory has
been developed ﬁrst in great generality by Kronecker in his <Allgemeine Arithmetik> or
General Arithmetic and Weil has repeatedly referred to Kronecker as the founding
father of algebraic—arithmetic geometry on ﬁnite ﬁelds. Kronecker’s theory of forms
is equivalently a divisor theory (of modular systems) for which inﬁnite descent works,
since homogeneous polynomials are ﬁnite (integral and rational) functions with integer
coefﬁcients and indeterminates (variables). In the same context, Weil stated his main
conjectures on the Riemann hypothesis in ﬁnite ﬁelds in (Weil 1949) and states that the
case for curves being settled, he was working on varieties of higher dimensions. Weil’s
conjectures were proven in full generality by P. Deligne in 1973 using also a form of
descent, i.e. cohomological descent (see above, Chap.4). Weil’s work in this area has
emphasized the deep analogy or rather the internal connection between ﬁnite number
ﬁelds and (algebraic) function ﬁelds as extensions of ﬁnite degree of the ﬁeld Q of rational
numbers and also of the ring Z of integers. The main reason for this is certainly the ﬁnite
character of the polynomial arena, as Kronecker had conceived it in his theory of forms
or general arithmetic. And it is in that arena where divisor theory naturally applies that
Fermat’s descent comes to play.
Fermat’s inﬁnite or indeﬁnite descent, as Fermat qualiﬁed it, is in fact a ﬁnite process.
Weil describes inﬁnite descent in the following :
Inﬁnite descent à la Fermat depends ordinarily upon no more than the following simple observation:
if the product ˛ˇ of two ordinary integers (resp. two integers in an algebraic number-ﬁeld) is equal
to an m-th power, and in the g.c.d. of ˛ and ˇ can take its values only in a given ﬁnite set of integers
(resp. of ideals), then both ˛ and ˇ are m-th powers up to factors which take their values only in
some assignable ﬁnite set. For ordinary integers this is obvious; it is so for algebraic number-ﬁelds
provided one takes for granted the ﬁniteness of the number of ideal-classes and Dirichlet’s theorem
about units. In the case of a quadratic number-ﬁeld Q.
p
N), this can be replaced by equivalent
statements about binary quadratic forms of discriminant N. (see Weil 1984, pp. 335–336)
What interests us here in this modern terminology is the ﬁniteness results and the
character of effectivity that attaches to the proofs by inﬁnite descent. In that context,
Fermat’s inﬁnite descent is a generalized Euclidean algorithm or a division algorithm in

120
6
The Internal Logic of Constructive Mathematics
ﬁnite number ﬁelds and in ﬁnite function ﬁelds. The original idea of Fermat’s inﬁnite or
indeﬁnite descent appears in his 1670 commentary on Diophantus:
Eodem ratiocinio dabitur et minor istâ inventa per viam prioris, et semper in inﬁnitum minores
invenientur numeri in integris idem praestantes. Quod impossibile est quia, dato numero quovis
integro, non possunt dari inﬁniti in integris illo minores (Fermat 1899).
I translate the last quotation as:
By the same calculation it is supposed that a smaller number is found in a descending procedure and
that one can always ﬁnd numbers smaller than the preceding one ad inﬁnitum, which is impossible,
since for an arbitrary integer there cannot be found an inﬁnity of smaller ones in integers.
Let us remark that the method of inﬁnite descent can be applied to a variety of problems,
starting with the proof of the irrationality of
p
2 or the impossibility of
x4 C y4 D z2
for all z > 0 and x; y ¤ 0. Inﬁnite or indeﬁnite descent is, in fact, ﬁnite; it does not
transcend the ﬁnite and the reductio ad absurdum is innocuous here, since the ensuing
double negation is ﬁnitary. The ﬁniteness of the procedure is still more evident when it is
applied to “positive” questions, as Fermat says. Take the theorem: Any prime number
which is greater than a multiple of 4 by one must be composed of two squares. If there
was such a prime number greater than a multiple of 4 by one, but which would not be
composed of squares, there would be a smaller one of the same nature and still smaller ones
till one reaches 5, which is the smallest number having the said property. One must then
conclude that the theorem is true. What we have here is simply a generalization of Euclid’s
division algorithm, but it has been used variedly from Fermat to contemporary arithmetic
geometry as a proof-theoretical device of reduction (Legendre’s term), Kronecker’s
elimination theory or decomposition of forms (homogeneous polynomials) in divisor
theory and diverse descent techniques as in Grothendieck’s programme. Of course, not
all those techniques are effective, even in number theory, that is, they do not necessarily
provide calculations with explicit bounds. In some cases, like in n-category theory (inﬁnity
or !-categories), descent can be encapsulated as a ﬂy down escape from the aether of
higher-dimensional categories, the totality of which live in the ˝-universe of all ordinals—
described by Cantor as an absolutely inconsistent plurality eine absolut inkonsistente
Vielheitgg. But even without the ˝ totality of universes, categorical foundations still need
an inaccessible cardinal of higher set theory, that is transﬁnite induction beyond 0, as V.
Voevodsky admits in his univalent foundations for homotopy type theory (see Voevodsky
2010). The same is true for Martin-Löf intuitionistic (or so-called constructive) type theory
with dependent or contextual types together with the program proof assistant Coq also
needed in Voevodsky’s categorical foundations. However, descent is still lurking in the
background under the clothings of the axiom of foundation introduced by von Neumann
for the cumulative rank structure of axiomatic set theory. Mochizuki (2012) is keen on
keeping the axiom of foundation as a descent procedure in the set-theoretic foundations of
his ambitious programme of inter-universal geometry for the putative proof of the so-called
ABC conjecture in number theory.

6.3
The Internal Logic
121
I would qualify such foundational programmes as descriptive—like in descriptive set
theory—as opposed to reductive foundational programmes, meaning that foundations
should incorporate a critical evaluation and a justiﬁcation for mathematical practice
hopefully within mathematics itself with a minimal (constructivist) philosophy, not just a
unifying language. Although descriptive theories may have a computational or algorithmic
intent, as in Voevedsky’s univalent foundations or in Mochizuki inter-universal geometry,
the abstract or general framework in higher category theory or higher topos theory,
which both need transﬁnite induction (and recursion), is not constructive or so feebly
constructive that the computational output seems to be a by-product, rather than a
natural outcome of the theory—the algorithmic results are most of the time grounded on
polynomial arithmetic as a basis for higher (alien) structures or creatures! Note that the
ABC conjecture mentioned above has been demonstrated for polynomials constructively,
that is by elementary (non-analytic) means. In the theorem about polynomials, for coprime
polynomials A.t/, B.t/, C.t/ with ACB D C, one uses simply the maximum of the degrees
which is smaller or equal to the number n0 of roots of ABC
max.degfA; B; Cg 
 n0.ABC/  1:
For coprime positive integers A, B, C and the product of distinct prime factors or radical
of (ABC), the conjecture states that
rad.ABC/ < C D A C B
and that there is only a ﬁnite number of such triples A, B, C.
This is a ﬁniteness result and if it were to be proven conclusively for integers,
many other ﬁniteness results would follow constructively, for example Faltings’ result
for Mordell’s conjecture on the ﬁnite number of rational points on an elliptic curve or
Wiles’ result for Fermat’s last theorem. If this programme is going to succeed, instead of
Mochizuki’s inter-universal geometry, one could speak of universal arithmetic in the sense
of Newton’s arithmetica universalis or of general arithmetic in the sense of Kronecker’s
allgemeine Arithmetik!
Let us remark that there is connection between the ABC conjecture and Pythagorean
triples like a2 C b2 D c2 at the basis of the Pythagorean theorem which is the foundation
of differential geometry—and physical geometry. We have thus a thorough arithmetization
from pure mathematics to theoretical physics in a constructivist perspective.
6.3
The Internal Logic
The logical outcome of this can be stated in a few words : both disjuncts in number theory
must have a number-theoretic content, while intuitionistic logic requires only that one of
the disjuncts be instantiated in order that a disjunction may have a truth-value or rather a
veriﬁcation value—the same for the existential quantiﬁer. What our example shows is that
a constructivist logic must be dependent upon an external resource, a numerical content, in

122

The Internal Logic of Constructive Mathematics
order to be effective in arithmetic. This means that the logic is derived and comes after or
is posterior to what Hilbert called <inhaltliches logische Schliessen>, a terminology I have
translated as <internal logic> (see Gauthier 2002 for details). Formal logic, in Hilbert’s
view, was an external metamathematical means <äusseres Handeln> to treat the internal
logic of mathematical theories or the inferences pertaining to mathematics proper, not to
the metamathematics or the proof theory of formal systems.
But if we follow Hilbert’s lead, formal logic must depend upon mathematics’ inner
workings and Brouwer, who is not a Hilbertian by any means, would follow suit and
concur by saying that the excluded middle principle is not admissible particularly in the
mathematical analysis of inﬁnite sequences or inﬁnitely proceeding sequences (of natural
numbers). Kolmogorov was well aware of the signiﬁcance of intuitionistic logic which
he interpreted as a logic of problems (and solutions) and he made a distinction between
real mathematics and the classical mathematics of pseudo-truth (pseudoistinosti) where
transﬁnite induction is operative. Problems, in Kolmogorov’s mind, are essentially well-
posed mathematical problems, since in the Hilbertian spirit, they must have a solution.
We know that Brouwer was suspicious of logic and we could ask if intuitionistic logic,
following Heyting and his successors, is faithful to Brouwer’s original intent. I give only
one example or counterexample in line with Brouwer’s practice, the attempt to confound
Gentzen’s transﬁnite induction with Fermat’s inﬁnite descent ; the former is designed to
provide a consistency proof for Peano arithmetic while, the latter is a constructive method
of proof in classical number theory, from Fermat, Euler, Gauss, Lagrange, Legendre,
Kummer, Kronecker to contemporary number theory and algebraic-arithmetic geometry
in the hands of Mordell, Hermann Weyl, André Weil, Gert Faltings among others.
6.4
Descent or Descending Induction
Inﬁnite descent in classical number theory from Fermat to Kronecker and Weil is not
inﬁnite descent in the set-theoretic setting of an inﬁnite set of natural numbers. It is in fact
a ﬁnite arithmetical procedure that has little to do with the transarithmetical process of
transﬁnite induction.
As A. Baker explains in his major work on transcendental number theory (Baker 1975),
Gel’fond’s and Schneider’s proofs proceed by construction of auxiliary functions and
polynomials and they then derive their results by induction on an arbitrary (ﬁnite) large
integer n by assuming that if the result holds for n  1, it holds for all n. In the same vein,
J.-P. Serre deﬁnes descending induction as acting on two (positive) integers m and N
with m > N descending to N  (see Serre 2009). For integers or numerical predicates,
the procedure looks like

Axn.n1/
Ax0 D Axnn:
Axn is what Bourbaki has called a general term. While classical inﬁnite descent works with
the descending sequence of ﬁnite ordinals (natural numbers), designated as weak well-
ordering by Kreisel, transﬁnite induction calls for the strong well-ordering of transﬁnite
ordinals up to 0 of Cantor’s second number class. This well-ordering has to deal with the
subsets of N. Here the logician must pick up a certain quantiﬁer-free subset of the ordinal
! hierarchy, because he knows that the set of all countable ordinals of the !’s including
the ’s is the uncountable !1 corresponding to the cardinal @1—Cantor suggested that the
continuum c was @1 D 2@0. The power set of the set of natural numbers is signiﬁcant in
that connexion, since the well-ordering principle says
8S  N.S ¤ 0 ^ Ax.x 2 S// ! .9y < x ^ y 2 S/;
that is, there exists a strictly decreasing sequence for all elements of the subsets of the set
N of natural numbers. This is the strong strict well-ordering of N requiring the excluded
middle on the power set of P.N/ D 2@0! Transﬁnite induction runs along an initial segment
of the !-sequence beyond the ﬁrst ! up to its limit 0, while inﬁnite descent starts with
an arbitrary integer n below the ﬁrst !. Here is one main cleavage between ﬁnitist and
inﬁnitist proof theory, but Gentzen wanted to believe that classical inﬁnite descent was
a disguised form of complete induction in order to justify transﬁnite induction over the
denumerable ordinals (see Gentzen 1969) Following suit, Kreisel has simply noticed that
it was a form of inﬁnite descent that Gentzen had used (see Kreisel 1976).
Polynomials as the ﬁnite support of inﬁnite power series are the natural extension of
natural numbers and provide with a ﬁnitist alternative to set-theoretic Peano-Dedekind
arithmetic. For polynomials of the form
P.x/ D a0xn C a1xn1 C : : : C an1x C an
in decreasing powers for integer coefﬁcients a’s and indeterminates x’s, one works with
their degrees (exponents or powers) and heights (the maximum of the absolute values of
the coefﬁcients) and the idea is to come down to irreducible polynomials, i.e. polynomials
that cannot be factorized over the integers.
I have emphasized the ﬁnitist character of inﬁnite descent and I want now to contrast it
with the inﬁnitist dimension of transﬁnite induction.
6.5
Induction Principles
Let us see the classical formulation of various induction principles
1. Peano’s induction postulate (ﬁrst order)
(PIP)
8xAx.A0 ! .8xAx ! ASx// ! 8xAx

124

The Internal Logic of Constructive Mathematics
—one replaces A by X (for subsets) to obtain Peano’s second-order postulate.
2. Axiom of inﬁnity in Z-F (correspond to second-order PIP)
(IA)
9x.; 2 x ^ 8y.y 2 x ! y [ fyg 2 x//
—this is Peano’s original formulation in Peano’s Opere scelte (Peano 1959)
3. Complete induction
(CI)
8x.8y.y  x/Ay ! Ax/ ! 8xAx
4. Transﬁnite induction
(TI)
8Œ.8/.  /A.; x/ ! A.; x/ ! 8A.; x/ I
—for ordinals  and 
5. Least number principle
(LNP)
9xAy ! 9y.Ay ^ 8z.z  y/:Az/
6. Set-theoritic inﬁnite descent
(STID)
8x.Ax ! 9y.y  x/Ay/ ! 8x:Ax:
By successive transformations on classical equivalences (tautologies)
8x:Ax _ 9yAy
and
.:8x:Ax ^ :9yAy/ _ 8:Ax
and by
.:8x:Ax/ $ 9xAx
I obtain
8x:Ax _ 9xAx
i.e. the excluded middle.
This way 3, 4, 5 are equivalent from the classical point of view (by contraposition or
indirect way), 5 and 6 are not from the intuitionistic point of view, since one would have
8xAx $ :9x:Ax;

6.6
Intuitionistic Logic and Transﬁnite Induction
125
with the passage
:9x:Ax ! 8xAx
prohibited in intuitionism, although 3 and 6 are supposed to be equivalent since Peano’s
postulate (PIP) is admitted. Markov’s rule allows only the passage
(MR)
::9A.x; y/ ! 9xA.x; y/;
Kolmogorov had allowed the excluded third for ﬁnitary judgments and he had recognized
that transﬁnite induction implied the axiom of choice (and excluded third) in the classical
framework of pseudoistinosti (pseudo-truth). (Kolmogorov 1925, Gauthier 2002, pp. 666–
667).
I conclude that intuitionistic logic should reject the identiﬁcation of transﬁnite induction
with Fermat’s inﬁnite descent, since it does involve a double negation of the denumerable
(inﬁnite) set ! of natural numbers or ordinals numbers 0.
6.6
Intuitionistic Logic and Transﬁnite Induction
In classical logic and mathematics, the least-number principle (LNP) is equivalent to
transﬁnite induction on the inﬁnite set of ﬁnite ordinals
(LNP)
9xBx ! 9x.Bx ^ 8y < x:By/
Substitute :Bx for Bx to obtains bq contraposition
(TI)
8yŒ8x < yAx ! Ay ! 8xAx:
From the intuitionistic view point, LNP replaces the excluded third for Heything
arithmetic (see Troestra and van Dalen 1968).
Suppose that I have a predicate A much that :
Ax D
8
ˆ<
ˆ:
0 ^ P
1 ^ :P
n
I have 9xAx; if I had a smallest y much that Ay and y D n, then :A0, : A1 hence
:.0 D 0 ^ P/ and .1 D 1 ^ :P/, which gives P et ::P (contradiction). If y D 0, I have
P and if y D 1, I have :P.
The intuitionist has a ﬁnal recourse through Markov’s principle
::9A.x; y/ ! 9xA.x; y/

126
6
The Internal Logic of Constructive Mathematics
and he can assert with a double negation on the existential quantiﬁer that
::Œ9xAx ! 9x.Ax ^ 8y < x:Ay/:
From a proof-theoretical viewpoint (here in a sequent calculus) one will suppose that
the universal quantiﬁer is isolated from the positive instances of the existential quantiﬁer
and from disjunction (Mints-Orevkov condition). Of course, intuitionistic logic requires
that in a disjunction .A _ B/, one of the member has a proven instance and the same is true
for existential quantiﬁer 9xAx that must exhibit an instance An.
One can then show that
9xAx ! ::9x.Ax ^ Ay < x:Ay/
is equivalent to
8xŒAx ! ::9z.Az ^ 8y < z:Ay/;
but here one must use the transﬁnite induction principle which is supposedly equivalent to
complete induction in Heyting’s arithmetic. Complete induction is admitted by intuition-
ists for all constructive properties of natural numbers. But there is a gap, since it can be
shown that the equivalence between CI and TI (and STID) rests on a double negation over
an inﬁnite set. It sufﬁces to repeat the preceding exercise with the least-number principle
(LNP)
9xAy ! 9y.Ay ^ 8z.z  y/:Az/:
I substitute :Ay for Ay
:9y.Ay ^ 8z.z  y ! :Az//
and I obtain by transformation on classical equivalences and MP
8y.:Ay ^ 8z.z  y ! :Az//
and
8y.8z.z  y ! :Az// ! Ay
and
8y:Ay
which is the consequent of the descent with
(STID)
8y.Ay ! 9z.z  x/Az/ ! 8y:Ay

6.6
Intuitionistic Logic and Transﬁnite Induction
127
obtained classically from the induction rule
.A0 and 8yAy ! ASy/
and from Peano’s induction postulate
(PIP)
8xAx.A0 ! .8xAx ! ASx// ! 8xAx
by MP.
The equivalence between LNP and STID is classically proven, but LNP is not deducible
from TI in intuitionistic logic (because of the excluded third principle). Otherwise, TI is
equivalent to CI and STID both classically and intuitionistically. There is a dilemma or
rather a trilemma: either CI, TI and STID are not equivalent in intuitionistic logic or LNP
cannot be derived from TI (or CI), nor from STID.
In order to contrast inﬁnite descent with transﬁnite induction, let us introduce the
version of Fermat’s descent with the efﬁnite quantiﬁer >
˙ for the unlimited sequences of
natural numbers.
I. Positive descent.

Positive descent excludes clearly the excluded third by

As “ﬁnite” descent stops at 0; 1 or n. It is only in that context that a quadratic polynomials
or a diophantine equation can have an inﬁnite (unlimited or efﬁnite) number of solutions.
For negative problems, as Fermat says, double negation must come down to 0 or 1 with
1 ¤ 0. This is the very meaning of reductio ad absurdum which boils down to the reduction
of a false premise to a contradictory conclusion in a ﬁnite number of steps, which is a
proper proof procedure for ﬁnite sequences (sets) in constructive logic and mathematics.
Brouwer had clearly criticized the excluded middle principle in his 1923 paper on
“The meaning of the excluded middle principle in mathematics, especially in the theory
of functions” (Brouwer 1975). What Brouwer calls the reciprocity principle for the
complementary species (set)
8x.::Ax ! Ax/

128
6
The Internal Logic of Constructive Mathematics
or the global decidability principle for a predicate P
8x.Px _ :Px/
is essentially from the “local” testability or decidability principle.
:A _ ::A
for a constructible element x0 D x or a sequence of such elements. The said principle,
Brouwer insists, does not apply indifferently to ﬁnite and inﬁnite species—species or
collections of properties in Brouwer’s intuitionism.
In his programme for the revision of classical analysis, Brouwer introduced intuition-
istic principles for the well-ordering of choice sequences, this is sequences of choice of
values in the well-ordered sequence of natural numbers. The bar theorem, the fan theorem,
and the uniform continuity theorem on the compact interval Œ0; 1 are such principles. The
bar theorem stipulates that “if a property is true for any sequence a (inhabited by initial
value) and is true for initial segment of values for a and if it is true for the concatenation
a < n > for all n, then it is true for all sequences in S (the universal spread, Dutch
“spreiding”)—for these notions see Gauthier (1976, Chap. 2) and Gauthier (1997a,b,
Chap. 5). There is a close or “barred” induction relationship between the bar theorem and
Peano’s induction postulate and S.C. Kleene has shown (Kleene and Vesley 1965) that the
general principle of barred induction implied the excluded third and there was the need to
restrict the induction to local decidability for sequences in order to constructively validate
the bar theorem. Kleene’s results and others are duly reported in Dummett’s Elements
of Intuitionnism (Dummett 2000). See also Troelstra (1969) and Troelstra (1976) for the
intuitionistic theoy of choice sequences.
Choice sequences are generated by successive choice of values that are stratiﬁed by
continuous operations or functionals on a reticular set of anterior choices to give rise the
to spread of choice sequences. A ﬁrst valid principle for choice sequences is intensional
continuity stated as
X˛ ! 9 .9ˇ.˛ D ˇ/ ^ 8ˇX.ˇ//
i.e. if a choice sequence possesses an extensional predicate or belongs to a given species
(set of properties), it is always possible to ﬁnd a continuous functional on another choice
sequence which corresponds to the ﬁrst choice sequence, since it possesses the same
extensional predicate or belongs to the same species having the same initial segment of
values. One can also deﬁne an extensional continuity (Brouwer’s principle for numbers)
8˛9xX.˛; x/ ! 9X8x8y8ˇ. N˛x D Nˇx ! X.ˇ; y//
meaning that if we have for an arbitrary choice sequence a procedure which can determine
a natural number x, then for all other choice sequences having the same initial segments,
we can have the same procedure for a natural number y; in other terms, the existence a
given numerical value for a choice sequence implies that there is a continuous lawlike
functional acting on that choice sequence.

6.6
Intuitionistic Logic and Transﬁnite Induction
129
An important consequence of the principles is the fan theorem for spreads. The notion
of spread is deﬁned by two laws, a spread law represented by a lawlike function a with the
following rules:
1) a0 ¤ 0
2) 8n8m.a.n  m/ ¤ 0 ! an ¤ 0/
3) 8n9x.an ¤ 0 ! a.n  x ¤ 0//
a fourth ﬁniteness rule
4) 8 n9z8 x.a.n  x ¤ 0/ ! x  z )
deﬁnes a ﬁnitary spread law of fan. Here  denotes again the concatenation < x >,
a sequence containing one element. A fan law can be represented by a tree with the top
being the empty sequence.

The other law deﬁning a spread is a complementary map 	 of a spread law which associates
positive natural numbers to the members of a given species. A given spread is either
dressed or naked, according to the map 	 being in a species or not and a sequence is a
member of a spread if it immediately follows in the spread (tree).

The fan theorem is in essence a ﬁniteness theorem for choice sequences: in words if to each
element x of a fan ˛ is associated a natural number x, a natural number y can be speciﬁed
in such a way that x be determined by the y ﬁrst choices which generate a by the fan law ˛.
König’s classical lemma is the contrapositive of the fan theorem for a detachable species,
i.e.
8x 2 X.x 2 Y _ x … Y/
for species X and Y. König’s lemma says that any inﬁnite tree with ﬁnite branching displays
a inﬁnite branch (the trunk!) and requires the excluded third and the axiom of choice of
classical logic. It is therefore necessary to have a weaker form of the fan theorem to make
it constructively acceptable.

130
6
The Internal Logic of Constructive Mathematics
The fan theorem has been used by Brouwer in his proof of an important theorem in
intuitionistic analysis: “Any real-valued functions deﬁned on the compact interval Œ0; 1 is
uniformly continuous.” Intuitively, one can see that ay real-valued .x/ deﬁned iteratively
everywhere on the real line must also be so by the n ﬁrst choices of values for .x/ in such
a way that the difference between two functions .p/ and .q/ for two points p and q is
always smaller than a rational number 2n, whence uniform continuity—note the contrast
with the classical   ı formulation.
Let us ﬁnally remark that the induction principles on ordinals (the well-orders) have
the same meaning in classical and intuitionistic logic, except that one supposes species to
be decidable, that is for a strictly descending arbitrary sequence (or subsequence) F, one
has x0 … F or x0 2 F (see Troestra 1969). To the set-theoretic notion of well-order on the
subsets of N corresponds the intuitionistic notion of well-founded tree for which there is
no strictly decreeing (descending) sequence—a statement perfectly similar to the axiom
of foundation in Z-F set-theory. In both cases, if we want to pass to Fermat’s inﬁnite or
indeﬁnite descent, we have to use the double negation bridge on the denumerable inﬁnite
set of natural numbers N, while ﬁnite descent, the true meaning of Fermat’s descent, is
exclusive of the excluded third by
:.:FD/ $ FD
in a polynomial calculus for constructive logic and mathematics.
6.7
Transﬁnite Induction
The transﬁnite induction principle says:
8Œ.8/.  /A.; x/ ! A.; x/ ! 8A.; x/
for  and  as ordinals in the 0 segment of Cantor’s second number class deﬁned by
lim
n!! !!:::! 
n D 0
where epsilon naught is the limit ordinal of the omega hierarchy with n tending to !, the
limit of ﬁnite natural numbers n. Inﬁnite descent in set-theoretic terms with a universal
quantiﬁer on natural numbers boils down to
8x.Ax ! 9y.y  x/Ay/ ! 8x:Ax:
By successive transformations (classical equivalences and tautologies), I get
8x:Ax _ 9yAy

6.7
Transﬁnite Induction
131
and
.:8x:Ax ^ :9yAy/ _ 8x:Ax
and by
.:8x:Ax/ $ 9xAx
I get
8x:Ax _ 9xAx
which is the excluded middle. What we end up with is a derivation of the excluded middle
obtained from a double negation operation on the inﬁnite set of natural numbers. This is
equivalent to the double negation elimination rule, not admissible in intuitionistic logic
where the excluded middle principle is prohibited in general and speciﬁcally in non-
ﬁnite situations. Kolmogorov thought that the principles of excluded middle and double
negation were involved in some forms of transﬁnite induction (Kolmogorov 1925, 666–
667). The fact that intuitionists after Heyting (see Troelstra and Dalen 1988) accept
complete induction on the inﬁnite set of natural numbers
8x.8y.y  x/Ay ! Ax/ ! 8xAx
leads them naturally to accept transﬁnite induction, which is just complete induction on
ordinals up to 0. A similar exercise can be made with the smallest number principle
(equivalent to inﬁnite descent as classically interpreted, but not intuitionistically valid)
9yAy ! 9y.Ay ^ 8z.z  y/:Az/
By substituting :Ay to Ay, we have
:9y.Ay ^ 8z.z  y ! :Az//

Conclusion: A Finitist Logic for Constructive Mathematics
A simple idea for the internal logic of ﬁnite arithmetic is that such a logic should be
arithmetical, that is, it should represent or translate the logic of arithmetic in arithmetical
terms. The idea is to interpret logical operators, expressions and formulas in arithmetic and
that arithmetic is polynomial arithmetic. Logic can be embedded in polynomial arithmetic,
since it is a larger arena than integral arithmetic with all the arithmetic operations and it
constitutes a ﬁeld, in particular a ﬁnite ﬁeld where inﬁnite (indeﬁnite or ﬁnite descent)
can be freely enacted. The main advantage of the polynomial translation is that it is not
simply an assignment of integers to logical expressions (like Gödel numbers), but a direct
interpretation of logic in a purely arithmetical syntax. Such a direct translation would look
like the following:
a ^ b WD a  b
a _ b WD a C b

Remarks: The new quantiﬁer >
˙ is meant to express quantiﬁcation over the unlimited
sequence of natural numbers or Brouwer’s inﬁnitely proceeding sequences beyond the
ﬁnite sets subjected to the classical quantiﬁers. A way to formalize inﬁnite descent in
Fermat-Kronecker arithmetic would be to use the unlimited or «efﬁnite quantiﬁer » in the
following formulation:
>
˙xf.ŒAx ^ 9y.y < x/Ay ! 9y>
˙z.z < y/Azg ! >
˙x:Ax

6.8
A Finitist Logic for Constructive Mathematics
133
which is the «negative » version of inﬁnite descent. This means unlimited or indeﬁnite
quantiﬁcation on an arbitrary sequence (not an inﬁnite set) of natural numbers. The positive
formulation looks like this :
>
˙xf.ŒAx ^ 9y.y < x/Ay ! 9y8z.z < y/Azg ! 9z.z D 0 _ 1 _ n/Azg ! >
˙xAx
and it means that a descent could stop at 0 or 1 or any positive integer (like 5) in order to
give way to an unlimited number of solutions for diophantine equations, for example. This
quantiﬁcation is not bounded quantiﬁcation, nor quantiﬁcation in predicative arithmetic
à la Nelson, it just reveals a formal contrast to Peano’s induction postulate or complete
induction on the (completed) inﬁnite set of natural numbers.
The numerical expression “1” refers to the unlimited arithmetical universe. The
arithmetical expression Na for 1  a stands for a local negation in stead of the set-theoretic
topological relative complement. Such a logic could be called a modular polynomial logic
if we add a Modus Ponens in the form of
1  a0x  b0x .mod a0x/
where a0x and b0x are monomials (see Gauthier 2010 for details) and from the point of
view of Gentzen’s sequent calculus, the cut rule equivalent to MP is innocuous, since it
is modular, that is, taken into account and then discarded in a pure (cut-free) equational
calculus. Such a calculus is a calculus of polynomial content and could be considered as
an internal logic for Kronecker’s theory of forms in his general arithmetic (see Chap. 7 for
a detailed construction of the calculus).
The arithmetical logic I have sketched should be ﬁnitely decidable—the theory of
ﬁnite ﬁelds is decidable. Of course, the arithmetic in question is not Peano arithmetic
(or Dedekind-Peano) with its induction postulate on the denumerable set of natural
numbers, but rather Fermat-Kronecker arithmetic with inﬁnite descent substituting for
inﬁnite induction and acting on forms, that is the homogeneous polynomials with integer
coefﬁcients and indeterminates of Kronecker’s general arithmetic (allgemeine Arithmetik).
After the arithmetization of analysis by Cauchy and Weierstrass—one can include also
Dedekind and Cantor—and the arithmetization of algebra by Kronecker, my contention is
that Hilbert has inaugurated the arithmetization of logic pursued in the work of Skolem,
Gentzen and Gödel and particularly active in contemporary theoretical computer science
after Turing.
As far as number theory is concerned, the Gel’fond-Schneider theorem is a revealing
instance of constructive (see Gauthier 1978) proofs. Liouville’s and Lindemann’s proofs
on the existence of transcendental numbers were not constructive, Dirichlet’s analytical
proof on the inﬁnity of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions had to wait for the
1949 Selberg’s constructive proof. The French logician and number-theorist Jacques
Herbrand, a follower of Hilbert (see Coquand 2008), even formulated a general hypothesis
to the effect that theorems in non-analytic (elementary) number theory must have a non-
analytic, i.e. constructive proof (Herbrand 1968). It is an intrinsic feature of transcendental
number theory that the existence of transcendental numbers is only negatively or indirectly
demonstrated by reductio ad absurdum, but direct elementary proofs provide more

The Internal Logic of Constructive Mathematics
information on the content of a theorem in the case of constructive mathematics and
more so in ﬁnitist foundations. The emphasis is on what Hilbert called «Sicherheit» and
«Sicherung», certainty or certiﬁcation of the tools and means of the mathematician or the
logician who wants to count on more information in order to rely on the concrete proof
procedures at work in constructive mathematics and in its internal logic.

Chapter 7
The Internal Consistency of Arithmetic with Inﬁnite
Descent: A Syntactical Proof
7.1
Preamble
The question of the consistency or non-contradiction of arithmetic is a philosophical
question, that is the certainty of a mathematical theory and it has become a logical problem
requiring a mathematical solution. It is Hilbert who has put the original question and who
has attempted a ﬁrst answer. Having demonstrated in 1899 the consistency of elementary
geometry on the basis of a consistent arithmetic of real numbers, he turned to the question
of that arithmetic (the second problem of his 1900 list) which included besides the axiom
of elementary arithmetic an axiom of continuity, i.e. the Archimedean axiom with syntactic
completeness. Hilbert introduces functionals, that is second-order functions or functions
of functions, in order the use induction over the ordinals. Transﬁnite induction proved
successful in the hands of Gentzen, and thereafter Gödel’s second incompleteness results
which aimed to show that Peano’s arithmetic cannot contain its own consistency. Skolem
had already indicated in 1923 that a ﬁnitary consistency proof could be attained only by
ﬁnite processes, as Skolem says following Kronecker.
Gödel himself has not relinquished the problem of the consistency of arithmetic and
in his 1958 Dialectica paper, he came back to Hilbert’s functionals using complete
induction on ﬁnite types rather than transﬁnite induction over the ordinals. The extension
of the ﬁnitist point of view meant only that one has to transcend the formal system
of ﬁnite arithmetic in order to encompass all ﬁnite types, that is the totality of natural
numbers. Gödel will seek relentlessly philosophical (foundational) justiﬁcations for the
functional interpretation, as he admits (see Gödel 1990, vol. II, p. 305), but Gödel will

The Internal Consistency of Arithmetic
Fermat-Kronecker arithmetic, Kronecker’s general arithmetic of forms or homogeneous
polynomials with Fermat’s inﬁnite descent. It is primitive recursive arithmetic without
induction on the inﬁnite sequence of natural numbers, the denumerable set @0 from a set-
theoretical point of view. I call the unlimited sequence of natural numbers an “efﬁnite”
sequence adopting Brouwer’s idea of an inﬁnitely proceeding sequence, efﬁnite meaning
then indeﬁnite extension of the ﬁnite. There is no inﬁnite set in Fermat-Kronecker (F-K)
arithmetic only ﬁnite ﬁelds with extensions (possibly inﬁnite extensions) provided by the
adjunctions of indeterminates (Unbestimmte). The adjunctions are processes performed
in a ﬁnite number of steps for indeterminate quantities that can be iterated indeﬁnitely.
Fermat’s inﬁnite or indeﬁnite descent is also a ﬁnite process since it starts with an arbitrary
ﬁnite natural number and it stops at 0, the only limit-ordinal accepted in F-K arithmetic,
there is no !, the ﬁrst transﬁnite ordinal without an immediate predecessor. Of course, we
have here the dividing line between the Fermat-Kronecker arithmetic and Peano arithmetic
with its Cantorian set-theoretic universe underlying the semantics of ﬁrst-order and higher-
order logic.
The problem of the consistency of arithmetic from an internal point of view is purely
syntactical and consists in separating theorems from non-theorems (sentences from their
negations) and in showing that only theorems are provable, i.e. a D a or :.0 D 1/. The
decidability follows by enumerating the theorems and syntactic completeness ends up by
listing exhaustively the requiring axioms of the consistent arithmetic theory; above and
beyond, semantic completeness is external to arithmetic, since it requires that theorems
be true in a model—here consistency means “have a model” and it is in a set-theoretic
universe that a model is located in general.
The arithmetical (polynomial) translation or interpretation of logic allows for the direct
passage from the ring of integers to the ring of polynomials (and then to ﬁnite number
ﬁelds and function ﬁelds), in other words, from the ordinary arithmetic of integers to
the general arithmetic of polynomials. Such a course is deﬁned by a ﬁnitary ﬁnitist
constructivism without the detour via recursive functions in a set-theoretic setting, since
polynomials are already recursive having the property of continuity.
The idea of arithmetical logic is in line with E. Bishop’s constructivist stand of mathe-
matics as a numerical language. Bishop had confessed that his endeavor in constructivist
analysis was closer to Kronecker’s ﬁnitism then Brower’s intuitionism (see Bishop 1967).
But my programme of an arithmetical logic originated in my discovery of Fermat’s inﬁnite
descent in the writings of André Weil.
It is also André Weil who has directed me to Kronecker’s arithmetical theory of
algebraic quantities which Weil considers as the foundation of algebraic geometry (see
Gauthier 1994 for early indications of an arithmetical logic).
7.2
Introduction
The primary goal of an arithmetical logic consists in substituting inﬁnite descent à
la Fermat to Peano’s induction postulate. From the point of view of classical logic,
inﬁnite descent and complete induction are equivalent principles. However, in order to

7.2
Introduction
137
demonstrate that equivalence, one has to use the excluded middle principle with a double
negation over the denumerable (inﬁnite) set of natural numbers, a procedure forbidden
by the constructivist. Transﬁnite induction or complete induction on ordinals in Cantor’s
ﬁrst and second classes up to the limit (lim ! D 0) cannot correspond to inﬁnite
descent on ﬁnite number ﬁelds without violating the very idea of ﬁnite descent. Fermat,
Euler, Lagrange, Legendre, Dirichlet, Kummer and Kronecker have all used descent in
the spirit of ﬁnite elementary arithmetic. And Poincaré, Mordell, Weyl and Weil have
followed suit in their work on algebraic-arithmetic geometry. And Kronecker being a
pioneer of algebraic geometry, as Weil has emphasized, has elaborated a general arithmetic
(allgemeine Arithmetik) or the arithmetical theory of algebraic quantities, which has all
the essential characteristics of ordinary arithmetic of integers. For instance the unique
factorization of polynomials in prime polynomials, which Kronecker points out as one
of his fundamental results (see Kronecker 1968a). The main tool here is the theory of
polynomial content at the heart of general arithmetic: the actual formulation states
that two forms (homogeneous polynomials) F and F0 are equivalent, if they have the same
coefﬁcients (i.e. arithmetical content).
The coefﬁcients are integral and one can perform linear substitutions on such forms
provided that one substitutes integral coefﬁcients for the variables or indeterminates of
the forms. Indeterminates, Gauss’ indeterminatae, play a fundamental rôle in the sense
that they give the mathematical theory its greatest generality and invest sufﬁcient means
in the theory of forms for the integral representation of algebraic quantities. This notion
of polynomial representation avoids any recourse to semantics (notions of model or set-
theoretic interpretation). The needed syntactic instruments are formulated in a minimal
reduced formal apparatus.
The term “reduction” refers to the Euclidian algorithm for divisors or decomposition of
composite numbers. Inﬁnite descent is here applied as a generalized Euclidian algorithm
extended to the ﬁeld Q of rational numbers. The content of a polynomial in the context of
divisibility can be seen as the greatest common divisor of its coefﬁcients.
It is the ring KŒx of irreducible (prime) polynomials with coefﬁcients in the ﬁnite
number ﬁeld K.x/ which is going to be the principal theater of our operation and F.x/
will serve as the ﬁnite ﬁeld of decomposition where descent is effective. Vandiver (1936)
inspired by Kronecker has shown how to recompose the decomposition ﬁeld F.x/ of a
rational number ﬁeld Q of algebraic numbers by adjoining indeterminates one at a time,
that is in a linear time algorithm. Vandiver has therefore recomposed by ﬁnite induction
the decomposition ﬁeld Q by ﬁnite descent.
What is represented in the polynomial theory? First what we call Gödel’s polynomials
rather than Gödel’s numbers which are assigned to logical formulas on the one side and
on the other side the logical operations which are responsible for the composition of
formulas i.e. logical constants while variables are represented by the indeterminates in the
polynomials. The calculus has the goal of producing a ﬁnal inequation 0 ¤ 1 as a proof of
consistency for arithmetic. It is a double bijection that we ﬁnally have in the polynomial
representation; ﬁrst a bijection between integers and their polynomial representatives
and second a bijection between formulas and their polynomial representatives—in this
case we have an isomorphism. Here we have an internal isomorphism since we are all

along in general arithmetic, while the Curry-Howard isomorphism between types and
formulas can be deemed as external, since it is without arithmetic, not within. Finally,
arithmetical logic exhibits the features of a modular polynomial logic. Polynomial signiﬁes
“multiple division” as in the generalized Euclidean algorithm (Fermat’s inﬁnite descent)
and modularity pertains to Kronecker’s theory of forms which is at the same time a theory
of modular systems.
Our ﬁrst-order language L.T/ for our ﬁrst-order theory T has an efﬁnite supply of
atomic symbols:
1. letters for formulas (and sentences), A; B; C together with their punctuation signs,
points, commas, parentheses, brackets, etc.
2. letters for constants or coefﬁcients a; b; c; : : : and variables or indeterminates
x1; x2; : : : ; xn;
3. predicate letters pn
j and the predicate symbol D plus the arithmetical symbols
C; ; ./; ; ¤; Š; ; mod; 0; 1, polynomial symbols PnQn; a0b0 the absurdity symbol
?, and the symbol  for the end of a proof.
4. functions letters f n
j —when f is 0-ary, we consider it as a constant, plus function letters,
;  ; 
5. the connectives ^; _; :; !
6. the quantiﬁers 8; 9 and >
˙.
Remarks: the quantiﬁers 8 and 9 quantify over ﬁnite sequences (sets), while the efﬁnite
quantiﬁer >
˙ quantiﬁes over efﬁnite (unlimited) sequences with a pre-positional bound or
initial term without a post-positional bound or ﬁnal term (for instance the sequence of
natural numbers).
The terms consist exclusively of:
1. variables and constants
2. sequences composed of terms and functions letters, e.g. f n
j ; t1; : : : ; tn—for the terms
t1; : : : ; tn.
Formulas or wffs consist exclusively of:
1. atomic formulas composed of terms and predicate letters, e.g. pn
j t1; : : : ; tn for the terms
t1; : : : ; tn
2. any wff with connectives and quantiﬁers
Remarks: sentences are closed formulas, that is, formulas are “open” sentences with
the free occurrence of variables. An instance or an exemplar .t1; : : : ; tn=x1; : : : ; xn/ of a
formula A is the result of a substituting terms for the occurrences of a free variable.
The minimal logic has only one axiom, the axiom of identity

the elimination of connectives and quantiﬁers in a natural deduction system à la Gentzen.
Intelim rules are less systematic than the equivalent rules in a calculus of sequents, but
they are “closer” to the deductions in a constructive logic.

Remarks: it is understood that the variable of quantiﬁcation is not free, Axn meaning that
we have an unlimited sequence of variables and the meaning that with the elimination of
the efﬁnite quantiﬁer >
˙x, we get an initial numerical term. We still have the intuitionistic
properties of the disjunction—A _ B is provable if A or B is provable—and the provable
instance for 9xAx which is provable if we can ﬁnd a numerical instance t. Moreover, our
logic is endowed with constructive properties that apply only locally on ﬁnite sequence
(sets) and efﬁnite sequences (unlimited iterations). In the same manner, the sequent
calculus in the forms  ` A for  the antecedent and A the consequent—unique in the
case of intuitionistic logic—the rules for ! have the following form:
.I !/
; A ` B
 ` A ! B
.E !/
 ` A
; B ` C
; A ! B ` C
and the cut rule
 ` A
 0; A ` B
;  0 ` B
says that if we have A from  and if we have deduced B from another antecedent  and
from A, then we can infer B from  and  by “cutting” A. The cut rule corresponds to the
“Modus Ponens” or detachment rule.
A ! B

As for structural rules, we have simply

and this serves only to order antecedents following various combinations like additions,

the ordering of powers in polynomials—is allowed. The symmetry of inference rules in he

as is the excluded third from the cut rule. The cut rule itself does not show explicitly in our
formulation, since the polynomial calculus is a uniform calculus which rests on the chain
continuity of polynomial sequences (or ﬁnite series) which have an inherent subformula
property. Finally there is no ! rule, nor a @0 set; there is no set-theoretic semantics and
a fortiori no completeness theorem, completeness and other semantical properties being
excluded for ﬁnite structures by Trakhtenbrot’s theorem (1950). The inﬁnite is only a
“façon de parler” following Gauss’ dictum and it is not a manner of speech we use.
7.3
Arithmetic
R.M. Robinson’s minimal arithmetic (see Nelson 1987a,b, Chap. 3) will serve as a point
of departure. Robinson’s theory R D< 0; S; C;  > has the following axioms:
1. Sx ¤ 0
2. Sx D Sy ! x D y
3. x C 0 D x
4. x C Sy D S.x C y/
5. x  0 D 0
6. x  Sy D x  y C x
7. Px D y $ Sy D x _ .x D 0 ^ y D 0/
Axiom 7 for predecessor has been introduced by Nelson and replaces Robinson’s
formulation for successors
x ¤ 0 ! 9ySy D x:
The last formula is then a theorem and as Nelson mentions, axioms of associativity,
distributivity and commutativity are assumed to hold. Nelson has shown that R (rather a
variant Q or its formal system Q0/ is self-consistent. This minimal arithmetic is an open
theory, that is without quantiﬁers 8xx<y and 9xx<y for ﬁnite sequences (sets). For efﬁnite
sequences, e.g. the efﬁnite sequence of natural numbers we have the efﬁnite quantiﬁer >
˙x
or

This formulation of inﬁnite descent means that for given n, there is no unlimited sequence

The postulate of inﬁnite descent or Fermat’s postulate, as we can call it, is substituted
here for Peano’s postulate and it is manifest that there is no inﬁnite set in our axiomatiza-
tion. Fermat’s postulate allows for descending induction on the predecessors of an arbitrary
natural number n and it also allows a generalized Euclidean algorithm for polynomial
reduction and decomposition in Kronecker’s general arithmetic; exponentiation is also
bounded by the ﬁnite degree polynomials. For our present purpose though, we refer to
Weil’s algebraic version of inﬁnite descent (see Chap.6) as a ﬁnite decomposition process
in number ﬁelds (for ordinary and algebraic integers) as ﬁnite extensions Q.˛/ of the
ﬁeld of rational numbers Q where algebraic integers are roots of polynomials. The ﬁnite
decomposition process is closely related to the Euclidean division algorithm for quadratic
forms, i.e. homogeneous polynomials. Finite descent as a generalized Euclidean algorithm
is the method we use in the following. Here ﬁnite descent could be called positive in the
sense that it descends to 0 as the ﬁrst ordinal or 1 for the ﬁrst positive integer or n as
an arbitrary integer and for polynomials to degree 1 for linear polynomials or n D p
for prime polynomials or 0 for the constant polynomial (the zero polynomial is noted—
1). As Davenport (1968, p. 159) points out, Fermat’s version of descent was meant
for insolubility of Diophantine equations while Legendre’s version (and many others,
e.g. Lagrange’s reduction) was designed for solubility of polynomial equations as it is
the case for Kronecker’s theory of forms and polynomial division for modular systems
which is a main ingredient of our proof for the internal consistency of Fermat-Kronecker
arithmetic formalized in a modular polynomial logic. Since the efﬁnite quantiﬁer is not
itself bounded, it can be used as an induction principle, but as we have shown, it is not
equivalent to the classical principles of complete induction, transﬁnite induction or to the
least number principle which are all equivalent classically via the indirect route of the
excluded middle and the double negation principles, a route that is not practicable by the
direct orientation of the constructivist logician and number theorist or arithmetician.

Arithmetization of Syntax
In his classical results on the incompleteness of Peano’s arithmetic, Gödel supposed the
!-consistency of the arithmetic on the inﬁnite set of natural numbers. The weaker 1-
consistency for ˙0
1 sentences on recursively enumerable sets in the arithmetic hierarchy
derives from !-consistency for existential sentences and still needs the inﬁnite set of
natural numbers. Peano’s original second-order formulation of the induction principle is
based on the existence of the same inﬁnite set
9xf 2 x ^ 8y.y 2 x ! Sy 2 x/g ! 8y 2 x:

7.4
Arithmetization of Syntax
143
A formal system S in the sense of Hilbert has a ﬁnite characterization and Gödel devised
a way to assign natural numbers (Gödel numbers) to the primitive signs of S and to the
ﬁnite sequence of such signs (the formulas of S); the bijection between a ﬁnite sequence
of natural numbers in N and a ﬁnite sequence of signs in S is deﬁned by a map
 W Ns ! N
in such a way that a sequence n1; n2; : : : ; nk is assigned a number
2n1  3n2 : : :  pn;k
k
where pk denotes the kth prime number; Gödel is than able to immerse the formal system
S into Peano arithmetic. This is the arithmetic of primitive recursive functions generated
by substitution and composition (or recursion) from the initial functions, the successor
function, the constant functions like zero
8x.Zx D 0/
and identity functions. If one has also the  function for the least number k such
.k C 1; x2; : : : ; xn/ D .k; '.k; x2; : : : ; xn/; x2; : : : ; xn/;
one obtains the general recursive functions. Here, if recursive functions are arithmetical
functions, they have as domain the denumerable set N of natural numbers. In Gödel’s
words, !-consistency is deﬁned for the properties F.x/ of natural numbers, since it runs
through all the values of a function applied to the set of natural numbers. Rosser’s simple
consistency result for Peano’s arithmetic only substitutes to ! consistency the concept of
recursive enumerability which is equivalent by the fact that @0 D card @.
Our polynomial representation operates on a different stage. Take for the instance the
binary quadratic forms x2 C y2. These are homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 with two
variables and they induce equivalent representations of integers (see Davenport 1968). By
the isomorphism between polynomials p and integers a

for an integer a and p prime or not, signs and sequences of signs can be represented
by polynomials. A reduced polynomial in a ﬁnite ﬁeld F.x/ of g elements is simply a
polynomial of a lesser degree < q in each variable. Any polynomial
f.x/ 2 FŒx1; : : : ; xn
in that context is equivalent to a reduced polynomial (see Ireland and Rosen 1980).

144
7
The Internal Consistency of Arithmetic
If we go to general recursive functions with the  operator, we can avoid the least
number principle with the help of the minimal reduced polynomial which is irreducible
(being linear or of degree 1); we can also descend or reduce down to the zero polynomial
(noted—1). Since we can use the Chinese remainder theorem on congruences with
our generalized Euclidean algorithm (inﬁnite descent), we reach down to a minimal
polynomial of degree 1 or of degree 0 for the constant polynomial or—1 for the zero
polynomial. Besides, the least integer in a ﬁnite ﬁeld is obviously a ﬁnite integer and it
corresponds to the degree of the minimal polynomial (of minimal degree); that polynomial
is indeed irreducible.
One can immediately see how the polynomial representation works for Gödel numbers
that are replaced by what we can freely call Gödel polynomials. Take for a speciﬁc
example Gödel’s function ˇ which served to represents sequences of natural numbers (and
their associated sentences); it is a somewhat artiﬁcial device using the Chinese remainder
theorem in order to obtain a primitive recursive function. In order to have a more natural
representation, one has only to introduce the notion of reduced polynomial in the following
formulation

with the sum P.i1; i2; : : : ; in/ over the indices i’s.
We are going to need elementary facts about polynomials in one indeterminate with our
principal tool, the convolution (or Cauchy) product for polynomials. Polynomials of the
form
f D f0 C f1x C f2x2 C : : : C fnxn
where the fi are the coefﬁcients with the indeterminate x build up the subring KŒx of the
ring KŒŒx of formal power series. The degree of a polynomial is the degree of the last non-
zero coefﬁcient k D n, while the leading coefﬁcient of a polynomial f of degree k is the
constant fk and f is called monic if its leading coefﬁcient is 1. Thus polynomials are power
series having only a ﬁnite number of non-zero coefﬁcients. The convolution or Cauchy
product of two polynomials will play an important role in our translation; we write it

The sum f C g of polynomials f and g is obtained by simply adding corresponding
coefﬁcients. Homogeneous polynomials have all their non-zero terms of the same degree
and they can be put in the following convenient form
a0xm C a1xm1 C : : : C amx:
We are interested in irreducible (D prime in KŒx) polynomials. Every linear polynomial is
irreducible. KŒx has the property of unique factorization and this fact will be crucial in our
future developments.1 We are going to make an essential use of Kronecker’s notion of the
content of forms in (1968b, p. 343). A form M is contained in another form M0 when the
coefﬁcients of the ﬁrst are convoluted (combined in a Cauchy product) in the coefﬁcients
of the second. This idea of a content “Enthalten-Sein” of forms can be summarized in the
phrase “The content of the product is the product of the contents (of each form)” which can
be extracted from Kronecker’s paper (1968, pp. 419–424). Thus, for a form to be contained
or included in another form is simply to be linearly combined with it (to have its powers
convoluted with the powers of the second form).
We can adopt here a general principle of substitution—elimination formulated by
Kronecker (1882). We state the Substitution Principle:
1) Two homogeneous forms (polynomials) F and Fı are equivalent if they have the same
coefﬁcients (i.e. content);
2) Forms can be substituted for indeterminates (variables) provided the (linear) substitution is
performed with integer coefﬁcients.
We have immediately the following Proposition 1 (proposition X in Kronecker):
Linear homogeneous forms that are equivalent can be transformed into one another through
substitution with integer coefﬁcients.2
We have also the following Proposition 2 (proposition Xı in Kronecker):
Two forms F and Fı are absolutely equivalent, if they can be transformed into one another.
1Kronecker had proven the unique factorization theorem in the following formulation: “Every integral
form (D polynomial) is representable as a product of irreducible (prime) forms in a unique way” (see
Kronecker 1882, p. 352). Kronecker is interested in the theory of divisibility for prime forms (forms with
no common divisors greater than 1), rather than prime polynomials in his work. The notion of integral
domain and unique factorization domain are direct descendants to that theorem.
2This can be seen as the precursor of the problem of quantiﬁcation over empty domains. We know that we
have
A; A  B
B
in an empty domain, provided that A and B have the same free variables. But Kronecker had a more general
theory of inclusion or content of forms in mind and the transformation in question is a composition of
contents, an internal constitution of polynomials (forms) where indeterminates are not the usual functional
variables.

146
7
The Internal Consistency of Arithmetic
These propositions can be considered as lemmas for the unique factorization theorem
for forms which Kronecker considered as one of his main results. The substitution pro-
cedure is simultaneously an elimination procedure, since indeterminates “Unbestimmte”
are replaced by integer coefﬁcients. Thus an indeﬁnite (or efﬁnite) supply of variables can
be made available to a formal system and then reduced by the substitution-elimination
method to an inﬁnitely descending or ﬁnite sequence of natural numbers, as will be shown
in the following. The equivalence principle makes it possible to have a direct translation
between forms (polynomials) and (logical) formulas.
The substitution process takes place inside arithmetic, from within the Galois ﬁeld
F, i.e. the minimal, natural or ground ﬁeld of polynomials which is the proper arena
of the translation and indeterminates—Kronecker credits Gauss for the introduction of
“indeterminatae”—are the appropriate tools for the mapping of formulas into the natural
numbers. The main idea is that indeterminates in Kronecker’s sense can be freely adjoined
and discharged and although Kronecker did not always suppose that his forms were
homogeneous, we restrict ourselves to homogeneous polynomials.
We introduce an isomorphism:
 W Form ! Poly
between formulas and polynomials together with two more valuation maps:
 W Form ! .0; 1/
which evaluates formulas into Œn and
 W Poly ! .0; 1/
which evaluates polynomials into n, the degree of a polynomial.
We deﬁne the polynomial translation in eight clauses.
Clause 1) An atomic formula A can be polynomially represented by the isomorphism:
 W .A/Œn Š a0x.for an arbitrary A/
(where the a0 part is called the determinate and the x part the indeterminate and  is the
polynomial valuation function or map). Here the coefﬁcient a0 corresponds to a given natural
number (the “valuator”) and indicates that it is the ﬁrst member of a sequence, x being its associate
indeterminate. The “valuator” of the formula A is indicated by n and Œn represents the Gödel
number of the formula associated to a natural number n; it is thus a Gödel polynomial—here a
monomial. Molecular formulas are built up from monomials.
Clause 2) The negation of an atomic formula, that is :A, is translated as
 W .:A/Œn D .1  a0x/:
Clause 3) The conjunction A and B is translated as  .A^B/.n	m/ Š .a0x/.b0x/ for the product
of monomials .a0x/ and .b0x/.

Linear combination of coefﬁcients is of course of central importance in Kronecker’s view
and one of his fundamental results is stated: “Any integral function of a variable can be
represented as a product of linear factors” (1968a, pp. 209–247). In his (1968b, pp. 147–
208), Kronecker refers to Gauss’s concept of congruence and shows that a modular system
with inﬁnite (indeterminate) elements can be reduced to a system with ﬁnite elements.
This is clearly the origin of Hilbert’s basis theorem (1965, III, pp. 199–257) on the ﬁnite

Remarks: The efﬁnite quantiﬁer calls for some clariﬁcation. While the classical universal quantiﬁer
stands here for ﬁnite sets only, the efﬁnite quantiﬁer is meant to apply to inﬁnitely proceeding
sequences or efﬁnite sequences (with the three dots at the end signifying a continuing process).
These are not sets and do not have a post-positional bound; we put an n to such sequences and 2n
to sequences of such sequences
0; 1; 2; : : : ; n; : : : ; 2n
with the understanding that n signiﬁes an arbitrary bound. It should be pointed out that Boole in
his Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847) had also a universe (of classes) denoted by 1; negation
was interpreted as 1  x. The fact that the ring KŒx of polynomials enjoys the unique factorization
property exhibited by inﬁnite descent coupled with the proof by inﬁnite descent of the inﬁnity of
primes makes essential use, from our point of view, of the efﬁnite quantiﬁer.
We then have a combinatorial formulation
n
Y
0:::
.a0xb0xc0x : : : nnxn/
for the efﬁnite quantiﬁer; since nŠ D Q
c<n c, the combinations of n, I call this scheme the
absolute or standard scale. Any other scale is an associate scale (of indeterminates) and it
is reducible by substitution to the standard scale.
As a foundational precept, there is no !. Any transnatural or transarithmetic (transﬁnite,
in Cantorian terminology) ordinal scale, e.g. up to 0, is an associate scale and is
by deﬁnition reducible. It is clear, from a Kroneckerian point of view, that Cantor’s
transﬁnite arithmetic becomes a dispensable associate (with an indeterminate pay-off!).
The arithmetic universe N is naturally bounded by 2n and not by 2@o for inﬁnite power
series!
The internal consistency proof for (FK) Fermat-Kronecker arithmetic is following the
course of the radical translation or interpretation of logic into polynomial arithmetic, the
embedding of arithmetic into polynomials—with indeterminates as variables—where the
degree of a polynomial substitutes for the Gödel number of a given formula (or sentence) in
the arithmetical universe and ﬁnally inﬁnite descent which reduces polynomials according
to the decreasing order of their powers down to linear irreducible polynomials of degree
1 or down to the zero polynomial. What we have then is 1 ¤ 0, hence consistency or

 W P.deg—1/ D 0:
In that proof, Cauchy diagonal (the convolution product)does not transcend the domain
of rationality of polynomials and the combinatorial nature of polynomials is preserved
or conserved as a natural extension of elementary arithmetic. The elimination of logic in
that process is not alien to the quantiﬁer elimination procedure in model theory which
originates in Kronecker’s elimination theory, as we have seen (Chap.2). By replacing the
rank of a formula by the degree of the corresponding polynomial, we obtain a reduction
by unique factorization, that is a ﬁniteness result for arithmetic with inﬁnite descent.
7.5
Reducibility and Divisibility
The method of descent we used in our proof and which is most common could also
be called the method of decomposition, as Weil has called it—see Weil (1979a). The
decomposition process necessarily stops and this form of the descent is the one most
commonly used for the positive solutions of Diophantine equations. After Fermat,
Legendre used the method which he called reduction and it is the way it is used by
most contemporary authors from Mordell and Weil on.3 Local decomposition of forms
in a descent corresponds to a division process as in the Euclidean algorithm. Kronecker
has outlined in (1968b, pp. 419–424) the most general setting for the decomposition
of polynomial content. His notion of inclusion or content is expressed in terms of the
convolution product. The general form of the convolution product of two polynomials
(forms) encloses or contains higher-order forms and the substitution-elimination method
enables one to remain within the conﬁnes of integral forms. The product of forms

3Mordell says of inﬁnite descent in 1922 that you start with an arbitrary n—an arbitrary choice made
once and for all—and descend ﬁnitely. Hasse’s principle of local solvability implying global solvability
for quadratic forms relies on the same principle and is related to Legendre “positive” inﬁnite descent (see
Davenport 1968).

The Internal Consistency of Arithmetic
Hence, the notions of inclusion and of equivalence (reciprocal inclusion) of forms are
valid generally, i.e. for both forms and divisors.4 Factor decomposition—which we may
call devolution—is a descending technique perfectly similar to the division algorithm
for integers or the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials. The notion of greatest common
divisor of a ﬁnite set of elements is an equivalence class of polynomials and Kronecker’s
main result says as stated above.5
Every integral algebraic form is canonically representable as a product of irreducible (prime) forms.
For this unique decomposition (devolution) of polynomials, descent is used to arrive at
irreducible polynomials, much in the same way as in Euclid’s proof of the divisibility of
composite numbers by primes. Take a polynomial
f.x/ D a0xn C a1xn1 C : : : C an1x C an
of degree n. Suppose that n is not prime, then it must be divisible by two factors i and j
one of which, say j, must be prime; if not, j must be divisible by two factors, h and g, one
of which, say i, must be prime; if not, we go on in that process, until we reach an n which
is necessary prime, since there is no inﬁnite descent and we must stop at 1, that is linear
(and irreducible) polynomials. Formally,

By reductio ad absurdum, there are irreducible polynomials. Now the fact (Gauss lemma)
that the product of two primitive polynomials (with 1 as the greatest common divisor of
their respective coefﬁcients) is primitive can also be had with inﬁnite descent and reductio
ad absurdum. This fact combined with the fact that there is unique decomposition into
irreducible (D prime) polynomials, we obtain unique prime factorization. Kronecker’s
version of unique decomposition rests on the formula quoted above

4My emphasis is different from Edwards (1987a,b) who has chosen to look at divisor theory rather than
the theory of forms which is, in my view, the encompassing theory.
5See Kronecker (1889). Edwards (1987a,b) rightly says that Dedekind’s Prague theorem—a generalization
of Gauss lemma to the algebraic case—is but a consequence of Kronecker’s result. See also Edwards et al.

In translating logical formulas into congruent forms, we want to represent logical constants
in a polynomial language in order to integrally arithmetize (polynomialize) logic. It is
manifest in that context that deduction expressed in a turnstile A ` A or A=A is a
congruence relation in a modular calculus. Implication is rewritten
.Naox C box/n
for Naox D 1  aox, the local negation (complement) of logic; exponent n denotes the
degree of the polynomial (content) of implication that we reduce in the following way by

in the same manner, but we shall postpone the general case till we come to the efﬁnite

The combinatorial content of the polynomial is expressed by the power set 2n of the n
coefﬁcients of the binomial. I contend that this combinatorial content expresses also the
meaning of local (iterated) implication. Convolution exhibits the arithmetic connectedness
that serves to render the logical relation of implication. Implication is seen here as a power
of polynomials, ak and bm with k < m having their powers summed up and expanded in
the binomial expansion. Some other formula may be used for the product, but it is essential
to the constructive interpretation that the arithmetic universe be bounded by 2n. One way
to make things concrete is to analyse a ! b in terms of
a ! b D C..2n  a/ C b/
where C can stand for combinations or coefﬁcients. The formula is an arithmetical
analogue of the topological interpretation of intuitionistic implication.
Theorem. Local implication a ! b can be eliminated by interpreting it as .Na C b/n.
Proof. By the above construction.

7.9
Conclusion: The Polynomial Extension from a Finitist
Point of View
In his 1958 Dialectica paper, Gödel introduced his idea of the consistency of arithmetic
as an extension of the ﬁnitist point of view and instead of using the traditional Gentzen-
style transﬁnite induction, he conceived of functionals of ﬁnite types inspired by Hilbert’s
himself inspired by Kronecker, as I have shown in Gauthier (2013a). The proof exposed
above could be seen as a polynomial extension of the ﬁnitist arithmetical point of view and
I would like to review brieﬂy Gödel’s attempt from a polynomial perspective. Presumably,
Gödel who had insisted on an internal proof of consistency for arithmetic was dissatisﬁed
with the proof in transﬁnite induction and proposed induction on all ﬁnite types. A
polynomial interpretation of the functional Dialectica interpretation is thus suggested.
The central notion of the Dialectica interpretation is the notion of computable function
of ﬁnite types over the natural numbers. Types are derived by the following classes, type
0 is the type of natural numbers and the rule for generating types that stipulates that if 
and 1; : : : ; n are types, then .; 1; : : : ; n/ is also a type. These are really functions
on arguments from 1 to n, that is functionals since these functions are over other
functions for types > 0 i.e. beyond the natural numbers considered as individuals in the
universe of types, the logic of the functional interpretation is intuitionistic in principle or
constructivist in a loose sense, since Gödel considers that his interpretation is independent
of intuitionist logic. Gödel’s idea consists in translating a formula A of Heyting arithmetic
into a computable function
9x8yA.x; y/
where A is quantiﬁer-free.
We have then for the deﬁnitional equality for logic:
A ^ B/ WD 9xu8vy.A ^ B/0
.A _ B/ WD 9zxu8vy.z D 0 _ 1/ ^ .A _ B/0
8zAz

9zAz
WD 9zx8yA.x; z; y/0
A ! B/ WD 9UY8xv.A.x; Yxv/ ! B.Ux; v//0
For two recursive functionals, we have
F0 D 9y8zA.y; z; x/
and
G0 D 9v8wB.v; w; u/
where z, y, v and w are ﬁnite sequences or typed variables.

in order to gain the formal content of forms (homogeneous polynomials) with implication
or inclusion of contents “Enthalten-Sein” as in Kronecker.
In view of Gödel’s Dialectica interpretation, one could wonder if logic is concrete
or abstract, since it is the meaning of the concept which is at stake here. Gödel says—
thinking probably of Gentzen—that the notion of accessibility “Erreichbarkeit” is an
abstract concept which involves a kind of reﬂection on ﬁnite constructions. The notion
of functional of ﬁnite simple type over the integers is such a concept. Gödel shows how to
eliminate logic (implication and the quantiﬁers) by using a recursive functional
F D 9y8yA.y; z; x/
where y and z, z and w are ﬁnite sequences of variables of arbitrary type and A is a
quantiﬁer-free expression with the variables x; y; z. In the case of implication,
9xHx  9yRy
formulas are simply identiﬁed with (two) functionals (with their proper variables) which
coordinate “zuordnen” the consequent with the antecedent. I claim that the convolution
product achieves the aim (of the computational extraction of the content) of implication in
a direct fashion.
The formal content of forms (polynomials) in Kronecker’s sense of entailment or
inclusion “Enthalten-Sein” seems to call for such an interpretation by adjunction of
indeterminates. Whether the calculus of content needs an abstract (intensional) setting is
of foundational import. There is no doubt that the requirement of constructivity is satisﬁed,
while the requirement of ﬁniteness might be relaxed (with the efﬁnite quantiﬁer and inﬁnite
descent?). In any case, those requirements were the motivation for Gödel’s extension of
the ﬁnitist point of view in order to prove the consistency of arithmetic.

The Internal Consistency of Arithmetic
Recall that the Dialectica interpretation has inspired subsequent important work by
Kreisel, Spector, Luckhardt, Scarpellini, Girard and more recently Kohlenbach (1998),
Fereira, Oliva and Schwichtenberg in the proof mining project of classical analysis.6 Note
also that the functional interpretation is close to the no-counterexample interpretation
introduced by Herbrand and pursued by Kreisel who introduced higher type functionals—
Herbrand had used a negative interpretation, following Hilbert and Bernays (see Herbrand
1968), with his notion of primitive recursive function in the form

Kreisel (1961) has also wanted to use extensionally deﬁned sentences in a “strong”
interpretation of logical constants in a classical framework of truth conditions. Disjunction
has here the form
a; M; XjjB.a/ _ C.a/
and means
a; M; XjjB.a/ or a; M; XjjC.A/;
that is, we have either B(a) or C(a) in all the submodels M of a theory X for the sentences
of a ﬁnite type theory in the style of the Dialectica interpretation. Kreisel’s attempt was
not successful, but one may think that it is on this track that Cohen had his idea of forcing
in his proof the independence of the continuum hypothesis in Zermelo-Fraenkel axiomatic
set theory.
The forcing condition C for disjunction reads
C  .A _ B/ $ C  A _ C  B
and for implication !
C  .A ! B/ $def C  B _ C  A
with
C  ::A ½ C  A:
Forcing conditions are compatible with intuitionistic logic, even if they were not
intended to prove the consistency of arithmetic as in Gödel, but the consistency of the
6One may notice in that context that Kohlenbach with collaborators has adopted the Dialectica inter-
pretation for Kreisel’s proof mining project instead of Kreisel’s own no-counter-example interpretation.
This turn in logic is somewhat ironical when one remembers that Kreisel downgraded the Dialectica
Interpretation in his Gödel obituary in the Bibliographical Memoirs of the Royal Society 26, 1980.

negation of the continuum hypothesis in a minimal (transitive) model of Z-F. It is worth
mentioning here that the injection of generic elements in the minimal model obeys closely
the patterns of ﬁeld extensions to the minimal Galois ﬁeld, with the proviso that the
procedure here is not constructive, since the generic extension comes in a block or a
gender, while Kronecker introduces new indeterminates one by one—generic sets comes
as inﬁnite bunches of indeterminates in a set-theoretic universe!
Such a context is alien to Hilbert’s ﬁnitism (see Hilbert 1904, 1926). Hilbert for-
mulated the consistency problem in terms of primitive homogeneous equations that
are conservative over logical inferences with consequences “Folgerungen” coded in
homogeneous sequences “Folgen” regulated by the deﬁnitional equality D which Gödel
has recuperated. For Hilbert, deﬁnitional equality provides the basis for consistency
through the conservation of polynomial equations
x D x
and
x D y ^ w.x/ ! w.y/
where w is an arbitrary combination of objects x and y. Hilbert mentions composition
and decomposition of numerical signs or numerals “Auf – und Abbau der Zahlzeichen” to
which the proof procedure is reducible and he invokes here a kind of internal induction
“inhaltiche Induktion” different from (external) mathematical induction. This is perfectly
in agreement with Kronecker’s line of thought in his ﬁnitist enterprise. Moreover, the
elimination of ideal elements and the transﬁnite epsilon function in Hilbert and Bernays
(1968–1970) proceeds in the same way as it is a true descent “Abstieg” in the sense of
Fermat’s arithmetic and Kronecker general arithmetic of forms. The recurrence process,
as Herbrand calls it, must terminate in the ﬁnite and in accordance with Hilbert’s idea of in-
ternal induction, it is not equivalent to complete induction as I have shown above (Chap. 5).
Gödel, who late in his philosophical career, was still preoccupied with a ﬁnitist
(internal) proof of consistency of arithmetic, was unsatisﬁed with transﬁnite induction,
but could not escape the impredicative theory of functionals over all ﬁnite types and by
the same token could not match the ﬁnitist requirements of Kronecker and Hilbert, since
Gödel wished to eliminate logic (the formal system) in his consistency proof of arithmetic.
Our proof is meant to achieve that goal by appealing to a polynomial interpretation of the
arithmetical syntax of the ring KŒx of irreducible polynomials with coefﬁcients in the
ﬁeld k.x/ under the guidance of ﬁnite descent in the Galois ﬁeld f.x/ of ﬁnite elements.
The descent is an eliminative procedure and we come down to the bottom polynomial
equation with degrees
deg 0 ¤ deg 1
or
deg—1 ¤ deg 0

The Internal Consistency of Arithmetic
which essentially means that the arithmetical content of a polynomial or polynomial func-
tion is computable in a ﬁnite time, a performance out of reach for the Dialectica functional
interpretation reserved for the classical set-theoretic notion of recursive function.
Modular polynomial logic as the internal logic of arithmetic with its embedding in
the general arithmetic of polynomials does not need a truth-conditional or set-theoretic
semantics for the veriﬁcation of a D a, only a syntax, the correction of which is secured by
a calculus—from the Latin calculi meaning those small stones on which one can walk step
by step (Schritt zu Schritt), following in Kronecker’s steps. Since the polynomials in one
variable (indeterminate) I have used in my proof deﬁne a decidable theory (like monadic
ﬁrst-order predicate logic),7 I am conﬁdent I have kept pace with Kronecker’s ascent in
his ﬁnitist theory of higher forms (homogeneous polynomials) and at the same time with
Fermat’s descent in the ﬁnite ﬁeld of modular polynomial arithmetic. I have shown that
Fermat-Kronecker is internally consistent when embedded in a modular polynomial logic
which reﬂects the polynomial structure. Undecidability as in Robinson-Davis-Putnam-
Matijasevich theorem for Hilbert’s 10th problem begins in polynomials with thirteen
indeterminates. Polynomials in two variables are believed to be decidable with the gap
between two and thirteen still undecided.
In our case, polynomials in one variable (indeterminate) with coefﬁcients the natural
numbers are sufﬁcient to translate logical contents into a modular polynomial logic which
reproduces the internal structure of Fermat-Kronecker arithmetic. In any case, multivariate
polynomials from a computational point of view can be factored down to univariate
polynomials with the use of a modular algorithm (e.g. Gröbner basis) for evaluation
maps where the Euclidean algorithm or the generalized Euclidean algorithm, as we called
Fermat descent, is at work.
7The analogy is misleading though, since the algebrization of logic from Boole for the sentential calculus
to Tarski (cylindrical algebra) and Halmos (polyadic algebra) for the predicate calculus does not have
the generality or the extent of the polynomial calculus which is, as Kronecker has emphasized, a general
arithmetic with purely arithmetical content. In contrast then to the algebra of logic, the polynomial calculus
of the theory of forms pertains to the arithmetization of logic. Categorical logic as an algebraic logic does
not fare better since it does only translate isomorphically logical calculi into categorical structures (from
Lawvere’s elementary topos to closed cartesian categories or monoidal categories) only reﬂecting the
surface features of deductive systems.

Conclusion: Arithmetism Versus Logicism
or Kronecker Contra Frege
8.1
Introduction: Arithmetical Philosophy
I understand arithmetical philosophy on the model of Russell’s mathematical philosophy
as an internal examination of arithmetical concepts—in the case of Russell, the internal
examination of logical and general mathematical concepts (Russell 1919). From the
mathematical point of view, Kronecker’s general arithmetic could be seen as a successor to
Newton’s Arithmetica Universalis in the sense that both Newton and Kronecker wanted to
integrate algebra into a general or universal arithmetic. The two texts “On the concept of
number” (Kronecker 1887a,b) and his last lectures in Berlin “On the concept of number in
mathematics” (see the German text edited by Boniface and Schappacher 2001) summarize
Kronecker’s conception of number or whole number (integer). Kronecker shares with
Gauss the idea that the concept of number is in the mind or a priori while space is a
property or relation in the external world; geometry and mechanics do not belong to the
realm of pure mathematics since they have to represent and picture natural processes
by using the concept of continuity whereas number inhabits the discrete universe of
ordinals. Cardinals are invariants for the counting of groups of objects and equivalence
is an intensional relation. The concrete combinatorial procedures (Verfahren) of addition,
multiplication, congruence, etc. join with the general concepts of forms or homogeneous
polynomials and their properties in the process of arithmetization.
There is a Kantian background to Kronecker’s conception of number and Kronecker
could not help but mock the philosophy of mathematics of post-Kantian philosophers
like Schelling and Hegel.1 Philosophical deﬁnitions of number are useless and one must
start with the basic facts of a science (arithmetic here) and then fully elaborate the
1Kronecker does not reject all of Hegel and he quotes him approvingly on certain occasions, but he
has not taken Hegel’s conception of number seriously. One should mention however that contemporary
mathematicians, like Lawvere in category theory, logicians in non-standard analysis and philosophers of
logic (dialetheism and paraconsistent logic) have tried to make good of some of Hegel’s ideas.

Arithmetism versus Logicism
conceptual determinations (Begriffsbestimmungen) of the subject matter. In that sense,
pure mathematics was for Kronecker an experimental science in the construction of
concepts in accord with Kant’s dictum “Mathematics constructs concepts, philosophy
analyzes them”. Beyond this motto, Kronecker has hoped for a thorough arithmetization
of mathematics, especially algebra; arithmetization of algebra has been the main task of
his mathematical life as Kronecker confesses in a letter to Lipschitz (Kronecker 1886,
pp. 181–182)
On that occasion (the publication of his 1882 paper), I have found the long-sought foundations of
my entire theory of forms which somehow brings to completion “the arithmetization of algebra”
which has been the goal of my whole mathematical life; it is evident to me that at the same time
arithmetic cannot dispense with the “association of forms” and that without them, it can only go
astray in meandering thoughts (Gedankengespinste) as is the case with Dedekind, where the true
nature of the matter is obscured rather than illuminated.
(my translation)
Beyond the polemical tone, one sees the central role of his 1882 formulation and
it is especially in that connection that Hermann Weyl has asserted the superiority
of Kronecker’s algorithmic approach in algebraic number theory with his domains of
rationality (Rationalitätsbereiche) over Dedekind’s concept of ﬁeld (Körper). Association
of forms means in that context homogeneous polynomials with integer coefﬁcients and
indeterminates, the central topic of Kronecker’s major work (1882) “Die Grundzüge einer
arithmetischen Theorie der algebraischen Grössen” (“On the Fundamental Features of an
Arithmetical Theory of Algebraic Quantities”).
As far as analysis is concerned, Kronecker has sought arithmetical invariants in
the theory of elliptic functions and Weil has granted him the status of the pioneer of
algebraic-arithmetic geometry. In those lectures of 1891, Kronecker comes back to the
approximation method which he calls localization (Isolierung) of real roots of an algebraic
equation in well-deﬁned intervals of values for algebraic equalities and inequalities. In his
criticism of Bolzano’s theorem on intermediate values, Kronecker villiﬁes Bolzano for
having used the crudest means (mit den rohesten Mitteln) to obtain an analytical result
which cannot be applied to the roots of an entire function. He also mentions Dirichlet’s
celebrated analytical proof on the inﬁnity of primes in any arithmetical progression which
he has discussed in his Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie (Kronecker 1901). As K. Hensel
puts it in the Preface, the methods of arithmetic and algebra rest on a ﬁnite number of
steps, “eine endliche Anzahl von Versuchen”, while analysis is built upon the concepts
of continuity and limit. Here Kronecker tackles Dirichlet’s transcendental proof on the
inﬁnity of primes in any arithmetical progression and introduces an arithmetical extension
on a ﬁnite interval ( : : : ) for two integers ;  where one must ﬁnd at least one prime
of the form hm C r for m and r with no common divisors. Kronecker says that it is one
case among others where arithmetic can do more than analysis and go beyond analytical
methods. Dirichlet had used inﬁnitesimal analysis (inﬁnite series) in his proof and had
confessed that what was still lacking were the right principles or conditions under which
transcendental relations between indeterminate integers could be removed.
Kronecker deﬁnes arithmetic as pure mathematics free from space and time (see
Boniface and Schappacher 2001, p. 227) and pays tribute to Gauss for having deﬁned

8.1
Introduction: Arithmetical Philosophy
165
the true nature of arithmetic with the introduction of the concepts of composition (and
decomposition into roots) of algebraic systems, in this case quadratic forms (ibid.,
262), and he credits him also with the introduction of the notion of indeterminates
(indeterminatae). In his opposition to the analytical concepts of continuity and limit,
Kronecker is echoing Gauss who in a 1831 letter to Schumacher did denounce the use of
completed inﬁnite quantities (vollendete unendliche Grösse) with the maxim “The inﬁnite
is only a manner of speech”, “Das Unendliche ist nur eine Façon de parler”. Kronecker
could have made that maxim his own, but Leibniz had already qualiﬁed those inﬁnitesimal
quantities as useful ﬁctions in the calculus. Kronecker would have been surprised though,
had he studied more seriously Hegel’s conception of the mathematical inﬁnite, to learn that
Hegel espoused the Leibnizian-Gaussian idea of a differential calculus dealing with the
relative character of quantities rather than with the absolute limits of an inﬁnite iterative
process. In any case, Kronecker’s view of the matter is in total agreement with Gauss’
arithmetical philosophy and it is no surprise this time if he has opposed Cantor’s practice
of transﬁnite arithmetic which he has discarded as mathematical sophistry.
Kronecker even invited Cantor on one occasion to do real mathematics rather than
theology! But both were in agreement that mathematics was a free creation of the human
mind. They would disagree though on the kind of creations that could constitute real math-
ematics. For the ﬁnitist or constructivist mathematician there is a divide between tractable
and intractable problems, as contemporary theoretical computer science would name it.
Transﬁnite arithmetic in that sense is only tractable maybe in God’s mind or in some ideal
realm, as Cantor (or a Platonist) would believe. Only well-posed problems could have a
deﬁnitive solution, Hilbert would advise. One example is Cantor’s continuum hypothesis.
Hilbert’s failed attempt at a solution was ill-advised as the problem is intractable within
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, since Gödel’s and Cohen’s results indicate that it is not
decidable in Z-F, meaning that it is not a well-posed problem within that theory. Another
example is E. Nelson’s failure at proving the inconsistency of Peano arithmetic with a
variant (Chaitin’s incompressibility) of Gödel’s incompleteness argument, Chaitin’s and
Gödel’s ideas are couched in the inﬁnististic language of Peano arithmetic with induction
on the set of natural numbers and Gentzen had to resort on induction on transﬁnite ordinals
while Gödel admitted that he had to adopt a transcendent point of view on ﬁnite arithmetic
to obtain his incompleteness result. Of course, Robinson arithmetic, a weak subsystem
of Peano arithmetic, does without Peano’s induction postulate and is still subjected to
Gödel’s results, but it is only due to the fact that Robinson arithmetic is also a set-
theoretical arithmetic with an unbounded quantiﬁcation over the set of natural numbers
as its natural universe and this conﬁrms again the idea that consistency or inconsistency
of Peano arithmetic is not provable by ﬁnite means. Constructivist or ﬁnitist foundations
do not lead to philosophical fundamentalism, they serve only as a guide to clarify the
distinction between the ﬁnite and the inﬁnite or the non-ﬁnite. Poincaré, who was also
an adversary of transﬁnite set theory, would have added that it is the inﬁnite that is an
approximation of the ﬁnite and not vice versa, a motto that Kronecker would have certainly
endorsed and that could well serve as a ﬁnitist slogan.

Arithmetism versus Logicism
8.2
Kronecker Today
Kronecker is present in contemporary mathematics as we have seen and his arithmetical
theory is at the core of today’s mathematical investigations in number theory and algebraic-
arithmetic geometry. But his work remains unchartered territory to many mathematicians
and most logicians and philosophers. From Hermann Weyl who has emphasized the
supremacy of Kronecker’s algebraic number theory over Dedekind’s theory of ideals
to André Weil who has ranked Kronecker as a most important pioneer in algebraic
geometry and to Grothendieck and Langlands, all have been inspired by Kronecker’s
arithmetical foundations. Brouwer, Hadamard and Poincaré have borrowed his notion
of winding number <Windungszahl> for the ﬁxed-point theorem in analysis, but it is
Kronecker’s theory of ﬁnite ﬁelds (domains of rationality in Kronecker’s idiom) and their
extensions that constitutes the heart of the matter. Of course, it is in the tradition of Fermat,
Gauss, Galois and Kummer that the idea of ﬁnite ﬁeld has played a central rôle. Finite
ﬁelds and their generalizations in algebraic varieties in the work of Weil, Chevalley and
Grothendieck have become the basis of much current research, e.g. motivic integration
and higher category or topoi theory. In that context, Grothendieck’s notion of scheme is
of Kroneckerian inspiration or, as Grothendieck says, is derived from the Kroneckerian
point of view. As we have shown, it is Kronecker’s theory of forms or homogeneous
polynomials and divisor theory (modular systems) which serve as the foundation for the
theory of algebraic varieties.
Arithmetic or general arithmetic as arithmetization of algebra in the hands of Kronecker
means that arithmetical foundations reach up to the higher stages of the mathematical
ediﬁce. It is that far that arithmetic goes with arithmetical means alone and the direction of
the search is the reverse of Frege’s intention of seing how far he could go in arithmetic with
logical means alone. We know that Frege stopped short at an early stage of the arithmetic
of real numbers without gaining much mathematical terrain in his logicist programme.
Frege’s legacy rests with logicians and philosophers of mathematics or philosophers of
language. Despite the efforts of contemporary logicists, Frege’s programme cannot be
rescued by logical means alone. The only outcome of mathematical interest seems to be
the complexity theory of Frege’s propositional systems and it has nothing to do with the
logicist thesis. As far as logic is concerned, the salvage move deals with a second-order
Hume principle of equality for numbers, transformed for the occasion as an extensional
equality for number concepts. The end effect is that second-order Fregean arithmetic is
equivalent to Peano arithmetic with no logical gain, if one adopts the Quinean dictum that
second-order logic is no more <pure> logic. In any case, some have asked for a change of
paradigms in philosophy of mathematics. H. M. Edwards, a mathematician and historian
of mathematics has urged for a foundational shift from set theory and logic to Kronecker’s
constructivism and the logician and philosopher J. Hintikka has also pleaded for a retreat
from Frege and logicism. But Kronecker remains ignored by a majority and a paradigm
shift is not looming large at the time being.
From the mathematical point of view, there is no doubt that Kronecker’s arithmetism
is winning over Frege’s logicism. From the philosophical point of view, there is not
much philosophy in the strict sense in Kronecker’s writings or in his mathematical

practise beyond the decidedly ﬁnitist posture. The foundational motive of ﬁnitism is the
leading force in the continuation of Kronecker’s programme of arithmetization by logical
means. Here comes Hilbert. Hilbert is the true initiator of mathematical logic which
he called metamathematics—for proof theory or the theory of formal systems—and the
ﬁrst contender for the arithmetization of logic. I pretend that Hilbert has not only taken
up Kronecker’s programme of arithmetization of algebra, as is evident from Hilbert’s
Nullstellensatz and other algebraic results, but he has also followed Kronecker’s lead in his
introduction of functionals in his attempt to prove the consistency of arithmetic by arith-
metical means, a project that was taken anew by Gödel in his extended ﬁnitist Dialectica
Interpretation. Hilbert, as I have mentionned, may have been helped in that direction by his
former student Hermann Weyl, who introduced in his Das Kontinuum (1918) procedures
of iteration and substitution for ideal elements on the basis of the sequence of natural
numbers in the spirit of Kronecker’s general arithmetic. Philosophically speaking, Weyl
was inspired by Husserl’s phenomenological theory of judgment as is the contemporary
Martin-Löf’s idea of a constructive type theory, this time though without the Kroneckerian
heritage of constructive general arithmetic.
The pivotal question of computability theory is the decision problem <Entschei-
dungsproblem> in Hilbert’s terms. A decision method for a formal system S consists in
determining in a ﬁnite number of steps if a given sentence is a theorem of S or not; the
decision problem is then to ﬁnd for the formal system S in question such a decision method
or show that there is no such method. Hilbert’s terminology in that context is <a ﬁnite
number of operations> (Hilbert 1935, III, p. 154). What Hilbert called internal consistency
<innere Widerspruchslosigkeit> is accessible from without through the axiomatization of
logic, a ﬁnite process which must end up on the question of decidability. The procedure
has to do with the internal logical deduction <das innere logische Schliessen> which must
remain as close as possible to the inner structure of arithmetic. Hilbert gives here the
example of his 1890 theorem on rational algebraic invariants which reduce to a ﬁnite
number of invariants for the entire system of invariants; this is the theological proof
denounced by Gordan—who produced later a one page proof!—but then Hilbert gave
a proof of his result in 1893 after Kronecker’s fashion of a ﬁnite number of steps (or
operations). Hilbert there pays homage to Kronecker who had created the tools for the
calculation of rational invariants in his theory of modular systems—see Gauthier (2002,
p. 20 and ss). for mathematical and historical details. But Hilbert’s notion of decidability
has also given rise to the host of undecidable problems as negative answers to his 10th
problem on a general or universal algorithm for rational solutions of diophantine equations
(polynomials with integer coefﬁcients). The undecidability results are stated in a set-
theoretic context from Gödel to Turing (the halting problem) to Matijasevich and problems
outside the ﬁeld of logic in number theory, algebraic geometry and computer science
as couched in the set-theoretical universe of abstract algorithmic methods. Particular
questions in those ﬁelds have usually positive answers and applied proof theory having
also more precise goals has more concrete results in extracting constructive content from
non-constructive logic and mathematics.
Transcendental arithmetic, as I have called it, is inhabited by transcendent ideal
creations like a supercompact cardinal in the universe V of higher set theory, but its
inner models touch the ground of mundane arithmetic by downward transitive sets, other

168

Arithmetism versus Logicism
creatures in category theory or in the topos-theoretic multiverse are linked also to the
same ground level through various descent techniques, arithmetic geometry is focused
on the ﬁnite accounting of rational points on elliptic curves—Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s
last theorem with the tools of algebraic geometry has a natural arithmetic grounding in
the ring-theoretic Noetherian chain condition for prime numbers while Matijasevich’s
undecidability proof for Hilbert’s 10th problem follows the path of a Fibonacci sequence
of even integers. What this means is that if  is in the sky, the sky is still anchored in the
earthly arithmetic of counting, if not in the rule-and-compass geometry of the terrestrial
plane. In any event, the anchoring is secured in algebraic geometry by the general
(polynomial) arithmetic of rational points as solutions of polynomial equations in a (ﬁnite)
ﬁeld K of an algebraic variety or scheme of ﬁnite type. Scheme is a Grothendienck creature
of Kroneckerian ancestry, as we have seen; although Weil and Chevalley have worked on
the concept, Grothendieck’s abstract notion is derived from Kronecker’s conception of
modular systems. Finiteness (polynomial arithmetic) is all over the place (geometry), if
one may say, and the internal logic of ﬁnite arithmetic grounds it all...
If Hilbert’s proof theory is a <logical arithmetic> and Tarski’s model theory a <logical
algebra> to some extent dependent on Kronecker’s arithmetism as I have attempted to
show, one could suggest that constructive algebra in the steps of Kronecker’s general
arithmetic may become the arithmetic of the logic of computer science or the true
algorithmic logic. The notion of Gröbner basis is a nice illustration of such a programme
with its organon of primitive elements in a polynomial ring furnishing ﬁnite algorithms
for the Euclidean division of large common divisors or for Gaussian elimination in matrix
theory and further in integral linear programmation where the programme variables are
integers. Of course, algorithms abound in arithmetic and number theory, from Euclidean
division algorithm and Erastothenes sieve to the various sieve methods. But the computer
science agenda looks like a combination of Fermat’s descent and Kronecker’s divisor
theory. The procedures are concrete here and cannot be compared with the abstract com-
putation techniques associated with the logical representation and translation of computer
programmes; the symbolic concrete implementation is of the essence in constructive
algebra and could be compared with the recent result of Agrawal et al. (2004) which use
Fermat’s <little> theorem,
ap1  1.mod p/
where p is a prime number and a is a prime relative to p. It is such a congruence
which provides the algorithm for the factorization of large primes and one can think that
the polynomial time needed for the actual computation is derived from a phenomenon
anterior to the computational programme, a phenomenon ingrained in the internal logic of
modular polynomial arithmetic (the FK or Fermat-Kronecher arithmetic). On a different
scale, Voevodsky’s idea of univalent foundations is a far cry from radical constructive
mathematics although it is supposedly representable in type theory (Martin-Löf’s intu-
itionistic type theory) and implementable in Coq’s system for the registration of proofs.
Algebraic theories in a categorical setting cannot provide either the concrete foundations
of constructive algebra since they rest on formal analogies (interpretations) between
logic, algebra and topology ultimately based on polynomials in an abstract general non-

sensical! picture. For example, the univalence axiom in homotopy theory says simply that
isomorphic structures are identical and that amounts to homotopical equivalence possibly
implementable in a computer programme for proof assistance or veriﬁcation. The alleged
content of the theory is geometric, while the formal calculus, if successful as it is assumed
to be, must rely on polynomial arithmetic in order to be consistent. Eventually, the abstract
construction must be grounded on concrete ﬁnite proof derivations with a reduction of
higher-level structures to elementary ones, which is the domain of arithmetic.
I could have argued in that connection that Kronecker’s higher-order form theory is
the mother (or the paradigm) of all type theories, at least in the tradition of Hilbert’s
functionals, von Neumann’s cumulative rank structure for set theory, Gödel’s functional
interpretation and constructive type theories. Russell didn’t probably know about Kro-
necker’s construction, but his idea of a ﬁnite logical type hierarchy is close enough to be
translated into the arithmetical polynomial structure. It should be noted that Frege used
the notion of <Stufe> or level in his 1893 Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, but they were not
meant as Kronecker’s levels or ranks of polynomials, but the ordering of concepts and
concepts of concepts (of numbers), and it is not clear that the Fregean logical hierarchy of
concepts has a mathematical (Kroneckerian) origin, but it is certainly the inspiration for
the Russellian simple theory of types with a ﬁrst level of individuals and higher levels of
properties or predicates like in higher-order logic.
Since the notion of Stufe was originally used in the algebraic theory of quadratic forms,
it could be couched naturally in Kronecker’s general theory of forms or homogeneous
polynomials, as I have shown in Chap.1. As for transﬁnite type theories of set-theoretic
descent, may they be called intuitionistic or constructive, they rely on resources beyond
ﬁnitistic foundations and as such should be considered as transarithmetical ideal copies of
the higher-order polynomial theory originated by Kronecker. Predicativity in the context
of constructive type theory means simply that one doesn’t want the full universe of sets
(U 2 U) in one embrace, but stops at a high enough cardinal to crown large (big)
sets, categories, types, topoi and homotopoi. From beyond and above there, it is hard to
imagine a safe descent to the ﬁrm ground of real classical arithmetic (elementary number
theory)! The claim of constructivity for constructive type theory (and related theories)
consists mainly in the rejection of LEM, the law of excluded middle, but once you have
climbed to ! or !! and so on up the Church-Kleene recursive ordinals or to 0, the limit
ordinal of the ! hierarchy, you have transgressed the prohibition, since you have used
a double negation on an inﬁnite set to identify transﬁnite induction à la Gentzen with
inﬁnite descent, as we have seen in Chap. 6. Even if you use quantiﬁer-free induction,
you have to pass over all ﬁnite ordinals to get to the ﬁrst ! and then proceed to !! for
the ordinal of primitive recursive arithmetic PRA or down to !3 for elementary function
arithmetic EFA with bounded quantiﬁers. One could argue under those circumstances
that formalized arithmetic, Peano arithmetic and its subsystems e.g. Robinson arithmetic,
cannot bypass ! for having essentially a set-theoretical, metamathematical, undercover
clothing. Indeed, classical arithmetic (elementary or constructive number theory) is an
entirely different apparel with an internal logic of its own with (in) ﬁnite descent and ﬁnite
polynomials, the (FK) Fermat-Kronecker arithmetic. However, constructive type theory
claims to be able to get beyond ! to higher inductive types with the help of a well-
founded induction – induction on the subsets of the inﬁnite set @0 of natural numbers

Arithmetism versus Logicism
– equivalent to transﬁnite induction. The protocole, ordinal encoding, is reﬂected in Coq
(after Thierry Coquand), a proof assistant for checking and verifying proofs once they are
done, that is after the fact. Coq as a calculus of constructions and constructors of operations
in a functional programming language with types is a computerized representation of
proofs that mimick constructive type theory through speciﬁcation and implementation of
programmes for value-dependent inductive types. The procedure indeed constructs types
inductively or iteratively as they come in as mathematical data, but here constructive is
meant in the broad sense of construction at large in a building site. Homotopy theory
à la Voevodski is an attempt to combine different approaches into a uniﬁed univalent
scheme—the univalent axiom—whose foundational signiﬁcance is still unclear despite
some high expectations. Rather, the homotopical or homotopological enterprise should be
looked upon as an interesting general framework for the presentation and representation
of abstract logical and mathematical structures, an unexpected progeny maybe of the
Bourbaki structuralist school or alternatively as a hybrid creature between a functional
language (typed -calculus) and a geometric theory (of topological spaces) couched in the
univalent language of equivalence classes (isomorphisms) reducible to logical identities.
What is the gain for logic and mathematics in that joint enterprise remains to be seen.
From the ﬁnitist stance, a consistency proof for classical mathematics is hopeless, as is
the inconsistency proof for Peano’s arithmetic as advertised by Ed Nelson, for it is only
from a transcendental point of view (or the view from above) advocated by Gödel in his
incompleteness result that one could raise such questions. Of course, the ﬁnitist views
those questions from below and cannot but refuse to imagine a Platonic realm of ideal
mathematics beyond the horizon of mathematical activity and its foundational justiﬁcation.
Arithmetical logic is the internal logic of arithmetic in the precise sense that there
is a correspondence between logical propositions (sentences) and arithmetical formulas
(polynomials) with logical constants translated into arithmetical operations. Set-theoretic
foundations are still present in type theory à la Martin-Löf and in homotopy theory à
la Voevodsky as an inaccessible ordinal is needed to cap the higher-order or higher-
dimensional structures and constructs. No doubt that these ideal entities would be deemed
transcendental by Kronecker and reducible or removable as ideal elements by Hilbert.
And the transﬁnite induction required, as a kind of analytic continuation, cannot be
constructively justiﬁed. Arithmetical foundations are devoid of geometric or set-theoretic
content insofar as they espouse the concrete procedures of a ﬁnite calculus on integers and
rational numbers. Polynomial arithmetic with integer coefﬁcients and indeterminates (free
variables) is a straightforward generalization of elementary arithmetic into Kronecker’s
general arithmetic in the passage from the ring of polynomials to the ﬁeld of rational
numbers and other ﬁnite ﬁelds. Arithmetical logic is likewise extended to a modular
polynomial logic—with a congruence relation to accommodate division for the ﬁeld of
rational numbers—if one considers that Kronecker’s general arithmetic is associated to a
divisor theory which is itself in a close relationship to the generalized Euclidean division
algorithm, that is essentially Fermat’s (in)ﬁnite descent on ﬁnite ﬁelds. Thus Fermat-
Kronecker (FK) arithmetic is the right characterization of an internal logic of arithmetic, a
modular polynomial logic intended as a descriptive theory of arithmetical foundations for
mathematics.

Surprisingly, the predicativist Nelson thought that he could use an incompressibility
argument à la Chaitin while Chaitin’s own incompleteness theorem is inspired by Berry’s
paradox and assumes at the same time the denumerable set @0 of natural numbers with
its implied consistency. As a related issue, Voevodsky’s ill conceived discussion of the
possible inconsistency of Peano arithmetic is symptomatic of a foundational disarray in
inﬁnitary mathematics, may it be in category theory, (higher) topoi theory, homotopy
theory and its companion constructive type theory (despite its name). All these theories
reach beyond PA to higher ZF theory looking for at least an inaccessible cardinal in the
transﬁnite cumulative hierarchy of ordinals. Even Gentzen’s proof of the consistency of
PA using the limit 0 is transcendent in that respect, despite the constructivist claim on
the part of many logicians. The transcendent or transcendental viewpoint from above
cannot be recovered or descended to the ﬁnitist standpoint and there is simply no hope
for a consistency (or inconsistency) proof for inﬁnitary mathematics as there is no use of
the consistency question for univalent foundations of homotopy theory or constructive
type theory with or without a Coq veriﬁer as a witness. Grothendieck himself didn’t
care much about doing mathematics in U-topia as the totality of all topoi and their
respective universes. It is no surprise then to see one of the main promoters of homotopy
theory, S. Awodey, expressed his scepticism as to the foundational signiﬁcance of the
univalent foundations of homotopy theory. On the opposite side of presumed abstract or 
continuous  foundations, ﬁnite computability and ﬁnite results with ﬁnitistic concrete
or  discrete  objects constitute the safe haven and the solid rock of constructive
mathematics.

Arithmetization of Geometry: From Algebraic Geometry
to Arithmetic Geometry
From the arithmetic of the triangle with a quadratic form to the arithmetic of the circle in
Kummer’s cyclotomy theory and what could be called ellipotomy in Kronecker’s theory
of the ellipse through the arithmetic theory of the plane, the surface and the sphere
from Descartes and Desargues to Gauss and Riemann, arithmetization of geometry seems
to be a major trend in contemporary mathematics and results like Perelman’s proof
of Poincaré’s conjecture (with the idea of a ﬁnite fundamental group) or Mochizuki’s
putative proof of the abc conjecture in number theory using the arithmetic of the elliptic
curves, as the celebrated results of Weil, Deligne, Faltings and Wiles, all point to a
vast programme of arithmetization of geometry. Mochizuki’s intended proof points to an
arithmetic version of Teichmüller theory of holomorphic (continuous complex) structures
with indeterminates or an indeterminate isomorphism, notions which suggest an extended
Kroneckerian landscape in Mochizuki’s own programme of general arithmetic geometry.
Whether the proof of the abc conjecture can be carried out is still an unresolved question,
but it remains that the conjecture itself is central in the mathematical panorama (see for
example Granville and Tucker 2002, It’s as easy as abc, Notices of the AMS, pp. 1224–
1231). One could conclude here that if arithmetic is not always the point of departure

172

Arithmetism versus Logicism
of mathematical theories, it is often their ﬁnishing line or their ultimate outcome, as
Kronecker had stressed in his time and as one should still emphasize nowadays. One
important conjecture yet unproven is the celebrated Riemann Hypothesis. Riemann had
conjectured in a 1859 paper that the zeros (roots) of the zeta function .s/ over complex
numbers > 1 have all real part 1=2; .s/ D

for the primes p of the Euler product:
It has also connections with physics via the generalization of global Dirichlet L-functions
from statistical mechanics to noncommutative geometry, quantum ﬁeld theory, M-theory,
etc., but these connections or analogies may not be deep enough to help with the proof of
the conjecture. Riemann had left aside his hypothesis saying in a note that it was secondary
to his main arithmetical objective—which was the search for the number of primes below
a given n. And Riemann turned decidedly to geometry and its hypotheses, but not without
arithmetic underpinnings.
In his 1867 Über die Hypothesen welche der Geometrie liegen, Riemann points out
that the construction of manifolds (Mannigfaltigkeiten) or n-dimensional spaces is based
on arithmetical metrical measures and their realization rests ultimately on the application
of the Pythagorean theorem in the inﬁnitely small. A Riemanniann surface as a complex
analytic manifold can be subjected to the same treatment when metrics are introduced
into the one-dimensional surface. I recall that Cantor had originally called his set theory
(Mengenlehre) by the name Mannigfaltigkeitslehre or theory of multiplicities. The name
itself, translated into English as manifold (in French <variétés>) means the same thing as
polynomials or multiple divisions. The connexion between the two is not accidental and
Brouwer who knew the meaning of words had adopted the name <spreads> (spreiding in
Dutch) to convey the same idea—the connexion extends to a bridge between geometry and
algebra! An other extended bridge can be built that connects Brouwer’s algebraic topology
to algebraic and arithmetic geometry. Among the many generalizations of Brouwer’s
ﬁxed-point theorem, Lefschetz’ theorem with its ﬁxed-point counting formula plays an
important rôle, for example, in Deligne’s proof of the Weil conjectures for arbitrary
algebraic varieties.
In the Riemannian context, the inﬁnitesimal ideas are derived from Gauss’ theory of
curved surfaces with the metric invariant ds2, the quadratic (polynomial) groundform.
This arithmetical geometry is the foundation of the theory of abstract spaces from the
vector calculus on metric spaces in Grassmann’s Ausdehnungslehre (theory of extension)
to Hausdorff and Fréchet (theory of metric spaces) or Choquet (theory of capacities).
Nowadays, Konsevich’s motivic integration or Voevodsky’s homotopy theory (and higher
topoi theory) look at geometric forms and spatial volumes in search of an arithmetical
content which they recover by descending to discrete (simplicial) sets and to fundamental
polynomials—also called forms by Kronecker. In the case of Voevodsky, it is instructive
to know that he started with ﬁnite-valued homotopy types with an integer n to make them

correspond to algebraic varieties (as untyped spaces) and then come back in the so-called
univalent foundational programme to type theory with transﬁnite types in the hope of
recovering some constructive content beyond the univalent axiom of (logical) identity
expanding into homotopic equivalence through paths between isomorphic structures or
spaces. Homotopy type theory is then typiﬁed in a companion so-called constructive
type theory climbing up a parallel transﬁnite scale assisted by a programming language
(Coq or Agda) that typically recopy proofs of theorems. In another parallel universe the
amplituhedron, a recent invention in quantum ﬁeld theory, is a geometric form endowed
with a positive Grassmannian, that is an internal arithmetical structure for the calculation
of amplitudes in terms of k-planes ﬁlling up an n-dimensional space.
The hypothesis I have been defending here is that mathematical imagination can
freely create abstract spaces or geometric forms, but these are abstractions that acquire
concrete meaning through the arithmetical operations which innervate all mathematical
structures. For example, motives in Grothendieck’s programme of algebraic geometry
were designed as a systematic study of algebraic varieties in order to articulate the
numerical equivalences embodied in their fundamental groups (of cycle classes on
subvarieties that is, algebraic correspondences deﬁned on the integers). One can ﬁnd a
similar <motivation> in Descartes’ Dioptrics where he speaks of geometric motives in
order to compose the <embroidery> of geometric motives for algebraic curves, a theme
which Descartes introduced at the birth of arithmetic algebraic geometry. After Riemann,
geometry has become a Riemannian manifold and the notion of space in algebraic
geometry has been algebrized as notions of vector spaces and algebraic spaces (and even
arithmetic spaces); at the same time, topology as study of spaces has been algebrized from
Brouwer on to Grothendieck and the notion of topos as a generalization of topological
space has transformed into étale topology a generalization of Euclidean space, itself an
algebraic object.
The geometry of algebraic varieties bears upon arithmetic geometry, since it has to
do with rings, number ﬁelds and function ﬁelds in the tradition of Kronecker’s theory
of moduli systems which has guided Grothendieck’s <schematic> programme (with
the notion of <schème>), as well as Langland’s programme with its number-theoretic
<correspondences>. Diophantine equations and Diophantine approximation also belong
to arithmetic geometry which could be deﬁned as the study of the intrinsic arithmetical
structures of algebraic varieties. If the starting point of algebraic geometry was the study
of systems of polynomial equations, it has lifted up to the height of abstract spaces and
varieties, the modern name for manifolds, but from the higher planes of abstraction, there
is a natural descent to the ground level of effective calculations and the internal operations
of arithmetical logic. The abstract language of geometric forms and abstract structures
is nonetheless necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of reconciling the abstract and the
concrete the continuous and the discrete, geometry and arithmetic. What we could call
Grothendieck’s dream is summarized in those few words: in his unpublished testament
Récoltes et semailles, he speaks of a river where all the king’s horses would come and drink
“tous les chevaux du roi pourraient y boire ensemble” (drawn from a beautiful traditional
French song Aux marches du palais). Let me remark that Grothendieck’s dream is similar
to Kronecker’s dream of unifying arithmetic, algebra and analysis, but without geometry
which was not an apriori mathematical theory for Kronecker. Grothendieck had chosen

174
8
Arithmetism versus Logicism
to express his dream in a categorical language and a topos-theoretic vernacular idiom,
but his dream transcends those linguistic limitations. Category theory, a descendant of
homological algebra and topoi theory, a generalization of the notion of topological space,
are the favorite candidates for mathematical generality and geometric abstraction, but they
must toil hard to redescend to the ground level of concrete content. Fortunately, descent
techniques in homology and cohomology devised by Weil are successful in regaining
most of the ground, especially in arithmetic geometry. However, higher topoi theory and
homotopy theory still need to climb down the transﬁnite ladder of the set-theoretic and
type-theoretic universes, as we have seen.
Arithmetic is the common ground of all mathematical theories, including the all-
encompassing category theory. There is no category-theoretic foundation of arithmetic
or number theory, let alone pure number theory. Category theory has evolved from
homological algebra to a general theory of symmetrical situations in mathematics with
functors and natural transformations or equivalences (isomorphisms for homology and
homotopy) and logic (equivalence classes). Here the notion of morphism, that is a map
between objects or structures, becomes a functor between categories and even that most
general notion can be approximated by polynomial functors in the Goodwillie calculus
mimicking the approximation of a Taylor series by ﬁnite polynomial functions of an
entire (complex-valued) function . Category theory is a diagrammatic art and a calculus
of diagrams designed to represent graphically algebraic relations by analogies between
different mathematical structures. As a theory of classiﬁcation of structures, model theory
stands in clear opposition to category theory. Here a theory of inﬁnite structures uses
deﬁnable sets (deﬁned by ﬁrst-order logic) to access categoricity in uncountable power
via the compactness and the Löwenheim-Skolem theorems to reach out to higher planes of
parent mathematical theories where stability and invariance describe common features in
various mathematical theories like algebraic and arithmetic geometry, complex manifolds,
differential equations, ﬁnite structures in search for a uniﬁed theory. The work of Morley,
Shelah and Hrushovski among other model theorists in that connection remains unmatched
by “structuralist” category theorists, but again the uniﬁcation in this case has to boil down
to some arithmetic foundational common ground which is not yet in view. In the case of
category theory, analogies extend beyond mathematics into logic, physics and linguistics
among many other disciplines. For logic, closed cartesian—with a cartesian product—
categories provide a link (isomorphism) between simply-typed lambda calculus and
intuitionistic logic via the Curry–Howard isomorphism while braided monoidal categories
reach larger or more numerous logical systems with enriched categorical structure. The
same is true for the notion of topos which once baptized elementary topos (by Lawvere)
becomes a powerful machinery with adjoint functors as substitutes for logical notions. By
the way, the notion of topos, invented by Grothendieck as a generalization of the notion of
topological space is endowed with a categorical structure, but the category of topological
spaces is not cartesian closed and therefore is not a topos : the general notion of topos
does not <cover> the notion of topological space, there is no topos of topoi therefore the
many universes imagined by Grothendieck! In that connection, a full universe of sets or
classes, categories and topoi might be inconsistent, as Voevodsky admits, but then the
inaccessible ordinal his univalent foundations scheme seems to require could belong to
an inconsistent universe. Needless to say, Max Tegmark own mathematical (Platonist

8.3
Arithmetization of Geometry
175
or Pythagorean) universe—see his book Our Mathematical Universe—is saturated with
inconsistencies and nonsensical analogies. I recall here that the general no-cloning or no-
homeomorphism theorem forbids analogies of any kind beyond crude isomorphisms. As I
have said (Chap. 5), the theorem applies to any many-dimensional not only physical, but
also mathematical universe (multiverse) of any dimension in any theory of sets, classes,
types, categories or topoi and <homotopoi> (from homotopy theory). It is in a way a
no-go theorem for universal or inter-universal (strict, exact or deep) analogies. On the
logical, philosophical and metaphysical side of things, not everything is possible in one
world, because there is a unique (zero to n-dimensional) actual world (like a point or a
line a surface at inﬁnity) and Leibniz could dream of such a world as the best of all the
possible worlds only God could dream of and even in God’s view that inﬁnity of inﬁnities,
as Leibniz expressed himself in his 1697 opusculum De rerum originatione radicali,
could only be an imperfect analogous multitude of combinations—pace possible worlds
semantics which also falls prey to the combinatorial argument! Apologists of the possible
worlds hypothesis like David Lewis invoke a recombination or patching principle of parts
provided they occupy different spacetime locations and this calls for higher dimensions
for which the no-homeomorphism idea is valid along with the indiscernability and domain
invariance corollaries as explained in Chap. 5.
The analogical way is not the pure logical direct route. That is not to say however that
pictures and patterns are not useful in logic and mathematics as representations of concepts
and surely category theory is a study of concepts, mathematical and extra-mathematical,
sometimes reduced to a taxonomy of structures. But in the context of the connectedness
of the abstract and the concrete the paradigmatic case is Grothendieck’s motivic theory
of geometrico-arithmetical correspondences in algebraic geometry. Here again there is
a counting of rational points or measures in motivic theory (e.g. motivic integration).
However some category theorists have followed the lead of Grothendieck and have built
(silk or lace?) inter-theoretical or inter-universal bridges between mathematical continents
as if categories and structures (after the 1965 book title of Charles Ehresmann) and topoi
were to achieve the grand uniﬁcation that was dreamed of by the Bourbaki school—
Grothendieck is a rebellious child of that school—although the axiomatic ideal of French
mathematical structuralism was alien to the American categorical spirit of Eilenberg and
MacLane. Analogies abound in mathematics and the most fruitful ones are deeply rooted
in mathematical theories. A paradigmatic example is the analogy (deep relationship,
correspondence or inner connection are better words here) between number ﬁelds and
function ﬁelds, an idea which originated in Kronecker’s theory of forms and which has
been pursued by a long chain of major mathematicians in algebraic number theory from
Hilbert to Hermann Weyl and André Weil, as well as in Grothendieck’s and Langlands’
programmes (see Chaps. 4 and 6). Here analogies work more like undercurrentsor tectonic
plates moving towards each other to create a uniform stratum. In any case, bridges (mobile
or not) themselves don’t hang in the air and they eventually land and sit down both ends
on their fulcrum, the solid rock of the ﬁnite arithmetic of polynomials.

Arithmetism versus Logicism
8.4
From Geometry of Numbers to Physical Geometry
and Physics
The scope of arithmetical foundations is not limited to pure mathematics, it extends to
mathematical physics and to theoretical physics, as I have tried to show. Hilbert, von
Neumann, Weyl had an idea of a <physikalische Logik>, a physical logic with a polynomial
probability calculus as an arithmetical foundation. Hilbert wished to axiomatize the notion
of probability to deprive it of its mystical character and Kolmogorov has succeeded
in providing such an axiomatization. A physics based on algorithms and probability
theory with local notions (states and observers) is certainly in line with a constructivist
outlook that privileges computations over metaphysical constructions, e.g. determinism
and ontological realism. In relativity theory, Minkowski’s spacetime is a good candidate
for an arithmetical treatment (with the geometry of numbers in the background) and
in quantum theory and cosmology renormalization procedures are meant to dissipate
inﬁnities in the ﬁeld of physics. In his 1926 paper <On the Inﬁnite>, Hilbert stated that
the inﬁnite is nowhere to be found in the physical world or even in physical theories, but
that the inﬁnite could have a place in our thought. The radical constructivist posture here
consists in eradicating the inﬁnite from our mathematical, logical and scientiﬁc thought
altogether. Arithmetical logic can achieve that goal if it obeys the Kroneckerian incentive
of proceeding in a ﬁnite number of steps <eine endliche Anzahl von Versuchen> as echoed
by Hensel in Kronecker (1901).
8.5
Arithmetization of Logic
The arithmetization of logic began with Hilbert and was pursued by Skolem, Herbrand,
Gödel, Tarski—for the algebrization of logic—Turing and theoretical computer science.
Brouwer has not contributed to logic—his heir Heyting did—or number theory, but he
has introduced the creating subject and its construction of the mathematical continuum
as a process in becoming <ein Prozess im Werden> in his theory of sequences, lawlike
sequences , choice sequences and lawless sequences on the foundation of the arithmetical
unlimited (efﬁnite) sequence of natural numbers. A natural consequence of the arithme-
tization of logic should be an arithmetical logic as an internal logic of arithmetic, as I
have argued, and if pure number theory, not formalized <external> Peano arithmetic, uses
Fermat’s inﬁnite descent as an induction or récurrence—Poincaré’s preferred idiom—
procedure instead of complete induction on the inﬁnite set of natural numbers or
transﬁnite induction on the inﬁnite set of denumerable ordinals and if the deductive
process must be made secure (Hilbert’s <Sicherheit>), it has to be performed within
arithmetic itself, as Kronecker claimed internal truth and provability <innere Wahrheit
und Folgerichtigkeit> for his general arithmetic. Besides Fermat’s descent, Kronecker’s
theory of forms provides with the internal content—contentual or internal logic—of
the modular polynomial logic sufﬁcient to encompass the conservative extensions of
ﬁnite arithmetic and logic. Internal consistency or self-consistency is achieved with

8.5
Arithmetization of Logic
177
arithmetical syntactical means alone—with elementary arithmetic as a minimal model,
if one wishes some semantical additional ﬂavor. No set-theoretic model notion is invoked
and we do not refer anywhere to the @0 set of natural numbers, only to the unlimited
sequence of natural numbers equipped with the arithmetical operations of addition,
multiplication, substraction, division (for the ﬁeld of rational numbers) and polynomial
(limited) exponentiation. Our interpretation of implication is crucial, we use a binomial
formulation of a ! b as .a C b/ for :a _ b to express the arithmetical content of logical
inference. There is no involvement of logic proper, since logical operations are directly
interpreted in a polynomial calculus with a congruence relation to cover inequality as
a local negation. Logic in the arithmetical setting has only a secondary role, it serves
as an ancillary formal device for the presentation or the exhibition of the arithmetical
content. The designation <modular polynomial logic> might sound as a misnomer, insofar
as logic is concerned, but insisting on internal logic, Hilbert’s <inhaltiches Schliessen>,
removes the logical or formal stint. This is not to say that formal logic is of no import for
mathematics, only that as the hygiene of the mathematical discourse, as Weil ventured
to say to the displeasure of many a logician, it must be used strictly at the threshold
of internal logic. Internal logic of arithmetic could be looked at as ﬁrst-order arithmetic
without the formal apparatus of classical logic and as a constructive foundational theory
for the whole of mathematics, it could also constitute the basis for the hierarchy of
logics by weighing their constructive content, from arithmetic to algebra to geometry to
algebraic and arithmetic geometry up to higher set theory and category or topoi theory
(and homotopoi theory!). In that perspective, arithmetical logic as a building stone for the
internal logic of mathematics is only a starting point.
