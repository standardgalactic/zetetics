**Freedom is the recognition of necessity/'
Engels

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE
This
is one of the great books of our time*
It
is not easy
reading* It is a book to be studied and annotated and returned
to again and again* The reader will then find that, however
often he takes
it up,
it will always give him fresh food for
thought*
The
author,
Christopher
St*
John
Sprigg,
was
born
in
Putney on October 20,
1 907* He was educated at the Benedic-
tine school at Ealing* He left school at sixteen and a half and
worked
for three years as a reporter on the
Yorkshire Observer.
Then he returned to London and joined a firm of aeronautical
publishers, first as editor and later as a director* He invented an
infinitely variable gear, the designs for which were published
in the Automobile Engineer. They attracted a good deal of atten-
tion from experts* He published five textbooks on aeronautics,
seven detective novels, and some poems and short stories* All
this before he was twenty-five*
In May, 1935, under the name of Christopher Caudwell, he
published his first serious novel, This My Hand. It shows that he
had made
a
close study of psychology, but he had not yet
succeeded in relating his knowledge to
life*
At the end of 1934 he had come across some of theMarxist
classics,
and
the
following summer
he
spent
in
Cornwall
immersed in the works of Marx,
Engels, and Lenin* Shortly
after his return to London he finished the first draft of Illusion
and Reality. Then, in December, he took lodgings in Poplar and
later
joined
the
Poplar
Branch
of
the
Communist
Party*
Many of
his Poplar
comrades were
dockers,
almost
aggres-
sively proletarian, and a little suspicious at first of the quiet,
well-spoken young man who wrote books
for a
living; but
before long he was accepted as one of themselves, doing his
share of whatever had to be done*
A few months after joining the Party he went over to Paris to
get a first-hand experience of the Popular -Front, and he came
back with renewed energy and enthusiasm* Besides continuing
to write novels for a
living, he re-wrote
Illusion and
Reality^

4
ILLUSIOJSL AND REALITY
completed
the
essays published subsequently
as
Studies
in
a
Dying
Culture, and began The
Crisis
in
Physics. He worked to
the clock* After spending the day at his typewriter, he would
leave the house at five and go out to the Branch to speak at an
open-air meeting,
or
sell the Daily
Worker
at
the
corner of
Crisp Street Market*
Meanwhile,
the
Spanish
Civil War had broken
out. The
Poplar Branch threw itself into the campaign, with Caudwell
as one of the leading
spirits* By November they had raised
enough
money
to
buy
an
ambulance,
and
Caudwell
was
chosen to drive
it across France. After handing
it over to the
Spanish Government, he joined the International Brigade, and
was
killed
in action on
the Jarama on Fcbruaiy^
12 ,
1937*
In a letter from Spain he wrote: ‘I'm beginning to feel an
old soldier, and already act as machine-gun instructor to our
section* I'm political delegate to the group, joint editor of the
wall newspaper, and have another
political
job,
so you see
I
have my spare time fairly well filled." He goes on to ask for
news from
Poplar,
no
matter how
small* "Out
here",
he
continues,
"where
our
Labour
Party
group
meets
in
the
Communist Political Commissar's room in the
offices of the
local
Anarchist Trade Unions,
it's
difficult
to
imagine
the
frame of mind of the Labour Party leadership at home."
His death was reported by a fellow Brigader, one of his best
friends, who has since been killed in the Second World War*
"On the
first day, John's section was holding a position on a
hill crest. They got it rather badly from all ways: first artillery,
then
aeroplanes, then three enemy machine guns. The Moors
then attacked the hill in large numbers. As there were only a
few of our fellows
left, including John, who had been doing
great work with his machine gun, the Company Commander
gave the order to retire. I got in touch later with one of his section
who was wounded while retiring, and he told me the last he
saw of John was covering the retreat with the Moors less than
thirty yards away* I enquired of all our chaps for him for the
next seven days, while I was on that front, but no one had seen
him again*
It was obvious he never managed to get off the
hill*"

for the novels and textbooks on aviation,

Illusion
and
Reality was in the
press when he left for Spain; Studies in a Dying Culture appeared
in 1938, Poems and The Crisis in Physics in 1939*
In a review of The Crisis in Physics^ Professor J. B* S. Haldane
wrote:
^^Caudwell has something
to
say about
science, and
something very important indeed, though he only half-said it.
I believe that the book will be a quarry of ideas for philosophers
for generations to come.^^ The same may be said of Illusion and
Reality. It marks an entirely new departure in literary criticism*
It
is the
first comprehensive attempt to work out a Marxist
theory
of
art,
and,
while some
parts
of the argument will
doubtless be modified by further research,
it
is as a whole a
permanent contribution to the subject, destined to become a
classic.
Caudwell was a map of genius, but he might have been that
and still not achieved what he did in his short life. A naturally
gifted thinker, he became a man of action. It was not an ac-
cident that his most productive period as a writer coincided
with
his
political
activity
in
Poplar. And
his death was
a
tragedy in the true sense of the word, because in it his life was
consummated. He lived and died a Communist.

INTRODUCTION
This
is
a book
not
only about
poetry but
also about
the
sources of poetry^ Poetry
is written in language and therefore
it is a book about the sources of languages* Language is a social
product,
the
instrument
whereby
men
communicate
and
persuade each other; thus the study of poetry's sources cannot
be separated from the study of society*
It
is
a common assumption of literary
criticism that the
sources of literature
are
irrelevant or unimportant, and that
literature can be completely
criticised in terms of literature*
There was for some time a similar philosophy about the study
of nature—^the mechanical materialism of d'Holbach, adopted
unconsciously by most scientists to-day* It was supposed that
matter could be completely described in terms of itself, and
since man
is made of matter, these terms would describe him
also. This philosophy began by divesting matter of all those
qualities
which
have
a
subjective
or
mental
component
colour, solidity, taste* Mass, size, time and space were regarded
as objective material qualities—matter described in terms of
itself; until Einstein proved that the observer also entered into
the determination of these* Einstein, however, made the same
attempt to produce an
absolute
term, the tensor, which,
in
its turn, has been shown by the quantum physicists' Principle
of Indeterminacy to depend on the observer* Nothing
is left
absolute
by modern
physics
but
equations—and
these
are
thoughts* Obviously
this unexpected outcome of mechanical
materialism is not due to the fact that it was materialistic, but
to the
fact that
it was not
materialistic enough. By giving
thoughts
and
sensuous
qualities
a
purely
subjective
and
fictitious
existence,
excluded from the reality of matter, the
mechanical
materialists
at
once
established
a
field
of non-
material reality which contradicted the basis of their procedure*
While mechanical materialism was developing the objective
or contemplated aspect of matter, idealism was developing its
active
or
subjective
side.
Idealism
became
the
study
of
sensuousnessy and
sensing
is an
active
process. The world
as

8
ILLUSION AND REALITY
known to man was shown to consist only of sensory qualities
forms,
concepts,
ideas* At
first Kant admitted
an unknown
thing-in-itself, but Hegel exploded this and left only the idea,
not
existing in man's head but out of
it—the absolute Idea.
Being absolute, it was objective; being objective, it was material.
Idealism had become materialism, but because from the start it
had excluded objective, contemplated matter it was the rigid,
ghostly materialism of Hegel's
Logic,
witli
a
self-sufficient
structure determined by thought.
This had only come about because in materialism the object
had been separated from the subject and regarded contempla-
tively,
while
in
idealism
the
subject
had
certainly
been
considered actively, but active on a nothing, on mere appear-
ance. Marx's
realisation of this led to the conception of the
subject-object relation
as an active one—man's
theory as
the
outcome
of
practice on
the
object^
sensing
as
the
sensing
of
something. Theory was seen to be generated by the struggle of
man the subject with nature the object.
But this conception could not rest there*
For, once
it had
become plain that the
errors of philosophy were due
to
its
abstraction of subject from object,
it also became
clear that
the active subject-object relation was nothing but man living
in nature. Not an abstract man in abstract nature, but men as
they really live and behave, who must live concretely before
they come to speculate abstractly, and whose abstract specula-
tions
therefore will bear the marks of their concrete
living.
Marx saw that the separation of subject in enjoyment and object
in contemplation which had occurred in philosophy was the
abstract
reflection
of a
similar
cleavage
in
concrete
living
between
the
conscious
existence of the
philosophising
class
and the unconscious actions of the remainder of society* Theory
and practice were sundered in consciousness because they were
divided in social reality.
Thus the understanding of concrete living came
to appear
to Marx as primary to the understanding of the products of
concrete living, of which philosophy is one* There is concrete
living itself, which includes both theory and practice, and there
is the theory of concrete living, which attempts to reduce
to
theory the concrete relation of theory and practice*

INTRODUCTION
9
Concrete living
is not solid
crystal. At any one time men
are doing different things and therefore stand in relation to
one another. The study of these human relations in a general
form is
sociology* This sum of human relations is not change-
less in time but changes rapidly. The general laws determining
the relations of human beings at a given period, and the change
of tliese relations from period to period, form the theory of
historical materialism.
Mechanical
materialism and
idealism
are
not
peculiar
to
philosophy but are
expressed
in the
science,
aesthetics and
history
of men.
If poetry
is
approached by
a
mechanical
materialist
in psychology,
it will be regarded
as
a form of
behaviour;
if by one in philosophy, as nothing but the grati-
fication of tlie ^^aesthetic^' sense inherent in matter organised
in a human body. The idealist position
is generally regarded
as a more suitable approach to poetry, which is then explained
in terms of the Beautiful, the True or the Good.
It
is not very
difficult for anyone genuinely interested
in
art to repel these attacks, although they are often as insidious
as they
are confused. But the same
cleavage of approach
is
also seen in the methods of those who remain entirely within
the
province
of
art and
refuse
to
accept any but
*^pure
aesthetic considerations.
The mechanical materialists of art regard the art work
as
the detached object, and attempt to elicit a theory of art from
which the subject or
artist
is
excluded,
a theory written in
terms of the technique or forms of the art. It is supposed that
when the
devices,
technique and
^Vbstract'^
qualities of the
art which can be examined independently of the
artist have
all been extracted and reduced to theory,
art will have been
described in its own terms. This is the theory of
formalism^
,
and
it
is evident that as a theory it corresponds in aesthetics
to
mechanical
materialism
in philosophy.
Like
these phil-
osophers,
the
formalists
are
left
at
the
end
widi
merely
subjective realities—^with concepts, ideas, schemes and rules.
The
idealists of
art regard the art work as
subjective,
as
tlie
'Teeling*'
in the mind of the appreciator or
artist, and
attempt to write a theory of art entirely on this basis. They
believe
that
the
aesthetic
emotion
is
ultimately
final and

10
ILLUSION AND REALITY
unquestionable,
that
it
is
wholly
inside
them,
that
any
criticisms of art are personal and subjective* This is the theory
of ^^emotionism''*
Not only does this theory correspond to that of the idealists
of philosophy, but like theirs it ends in a phantom materialism.
As
Ogden's
and
Richards'
theories
show,i
ultimately
tlie
aesthetic emotion is reduced to coenaesthesia and this in turn
is the excitation of certain nerves* Just as formalism becomes
*hdeas", emotionism becomes '^physiology"*
When Hegel had brought
the
contradiction
to
the
limit
where it was finally resolved on a new plane by Marx,
it was
still
possible
for
a
bastard compromise
to
arise,
the com-
promise
of
positivism
or phenomenalism*
This
solved
the
problem of the subject-object relation by making the relation
alone real* Only phenomena existed*
This solution was no solution. Since only appearances exist,
there is no reality (such as the mind or matter) which can serve
to organise or value appearances and
all have equal validity*
As the number of appearances is infinite, those organisations of
appearances, known as science, theory or truth,
are arbitrary
and unfounded*
In
fact,
positivism
is always dishonest and from the very
start smuggles
another
reality
(usually
the mind)
into
the
system in order to organise
it and provide some standard of
validity*
This
reality
will
be
concealed
under some
such
name as "convenience"
or "probability"*
Positivism
is thus
in fact generally shamefaced idealism or occasionally
(in the
form of agnosticism) shamefaced
materialism.
Positivism
in
philosophy
marks
a
degradation
as
compared
even
with
Hegelianism, and more so as compared with the real resolution
of the problem achieved in dialectical materialism*
Positivism,
therefore,
also appears in aesthetics as the pure
act of enjoyment of the art work, as "art for art's sake". Of
course this would give absolutely no standard of discrimination
between art works or between enjoyments of art works, and,
therefore,
in
fact
all
aesthetic
positivists
smuggle
in some
organising principle,
generally emotionist (integration of the

personality or reality of the emotion) but occasionally formal
(rhythm or ^Torm^')*
If well-known English works on aesthetics are examined,
it
will
be
found
that
even
those
writers who remain
purely
aesthetic
in
their approach adopt the emotionist standpoint
in one
part and then
in another part use
formalist
criteria
without any attempt to reconcile the obvious contradictions
of the two viewpoints* But it is, in fact, rare to find an English
writer on aesthetics who maintains a rigidly aesthetic approach*
Generally he imports also, from outside the field of art, con-
siderations which are psychological, historical or even biological
in origin, and as some of the considerations may be idealist in
their
theory
(as,
for
example,
psycho-analysis)
and
others
materialist (as, for example, physiology or Darwinian biology),
and as these may be mixed with metaphysical theories drawn
from
sources
as
far
apart and
hopelessly
in
opposition
as
Descartes,
Spinoza,
Hegel
and
even
Marx,
the
result
is
remarkable*
Specialisation
is
useful;
integration
is
essential;
eclecticism,
which
avoids
both,
makes
the
worst
of both
worlds and
is a characteristic feature of modern thought*
As regards this study of poetry, we reject from the outset
any limitation to purely aesthetic categories* If anyone wishes
to remain entirely in the province of aesthetics, then he should
remain
either a creator or an appreciator of art works* Only
in this limited field is aesthetics
^"pure''*
But as soon as one passes from the enjoyment or creation of
art works
to the criticism of
art, then
it
is
plain that one
passes outside art, that one begins to look at it from
^ ^outside
*
But what
is outside art? Art
is the product of society,
as the
pearl
is the product of the oyster, and to stand outside art is
to stand inside society* The criticism of art differs from pure
enjoyment
or
creation
in
that
it
contains
a
sociological com-
ponent* In
art criticism,
values
are ranged and integrated in
a perspective or world-view which is a more general view of art
from outside*
It
is an active view, implying an active living
relation to art and not a cold contemplation of it, and implying
therefore a view of art as active, with an explosive, energetic
content* And it is a view of art, not of society or of the mind*
But physics, anthropology, history, biology, philosophy and

12
ILLUSION AND REALITY
psychology are also products of society, and therefore a sound
sociology would enable the art critic to employ criteria drawn
from those fields without falling into eclecticism or confusing
art
with
psychology
or
politics.
There
is
only
one sound
sociology which
lays
bare the general
active
relation of the
ideological
products
of
society
with
each
other
and
with
concrete living*—historical materialism. Historical materialism
is therefore the basis of this study.
Although the other arts are discussed in their general relation
to society,
it was thought better to concentrate primarily on
one particular
art,
that of poetry, because
its ancient history
and somewhat
obsolescent
appearance
to-day
raises
crucial
problems for the student of aesthetics, while, in addition, the
fact that it was the art most attractive to the writer gave him
a special interest in the task.

I
THE BIRTH OF POETRY
I
Poetry is one of the earliest aesthetic activities of the human
mind* When it cannot be found existing as a separate product
in the early
literary art of a people,
it
is because
it
is then
coincident with literature as a whole; the common vehicle for
history, religion, magic and even law*Where a civilised people^s
early literature
is preserved,
it
is found to be almost entirely
poetical in form—that is to say, rhythmical or metrical* The
Greek, Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon, Romance, Indian, Chinese,
Japanese and Egyptian peoples are instances of this generalisa-
tion.
This poetry
is not ^^pure^' poetry in any modern sense. Wfe
may
describe
it
as
a heightened form of ordinary
speech,
without committing ourselves to this as an adequate definition
of poetry* This heightening is shown by a formal structure
metre,
rhyme,
alliteration,
lines
of
equal
syllabic
length,
regular stress or quantity, assonance—devices diat distinguish
it from
ordinary
speech and
give
it a mysterious,
perhaps
magical
emphasis.
There
are
repetitions,
metaphors
and
antitheses
which,
because
of
their
formality, we
regard
as
essentially
poetic.
This generalisation
is commonly accepted, and there
is no
need
to give more than a few
instances. Hesiod thought
it
natural to use a poetical framework for a theological work and
a
farmers^
guide.
Solon
cast
his
political
and
legislative
maxims into metre
as a matter of course* The metaphysical
speculations of the Aryan race in India were versified* Egyptian
astronomy and cosmogony were
poetical
in form*
Religion
spoke always in rhythm or metre, and
just as the epic grew
out of a poetic theogony glorifying aristocratic history, so the
early
agricultural
ritual,
cast
in
metrical
form, became
the
Athenian
tragedy
and
comedy,
and
finally,
after
various

14
ILLUSION AND REALITY
I
vicissitudes, survives as poetical drama to-day in the opera and
the Christmas pantomime*
Ethnological researches have further shown how any words
worth
preserving—^weather
saws,
farmers'
wisdom,
magical
spells or the more refined subtleties of ritual and religion
tend among
all
races,
in
all
ages,
to a heightened language*
This
heightened
language,
as
the
people becomes
self-con-
sciously
literary,
is eventually set on one side
as the
specific
vehicle of a department of literature known
as
Poetry, and
distinguished
to varying
extents
in
different
ages from
the
other uses of writing and speech* The form peculiar to poetry
in
a
civilised age
is
the primitive form of
all
literature* A
consideration of poetry must therefore be fundamental for a
consideration of literary art*
Among primitives we usually meet witli
a heightening of
language
on
formal
occasions
which
disappears
when
the
phrases
are written down*
This
heightening
is
eiffected by
accompanying
the words
with
music
or Tude rhythm—by
chanting them* It is tempting to assume, though by no means
certain,
that
rhythmical
or
metrical
language,
before
the
invention of writing, was always accompanied by some rude
music* Indeed one could make out a case for the supposition
that music itself was generated at the same time as primitive
poetry and that an aboriginal physical rhythm,
expressed in
gestures and leaps, in shouted words and meaningless ejacula-
tions, and in artificial noises made by beating sticks and stones,
was the common parent of dance,
poetry and music* Much
evidence for this theory could be found in Africa* Significant,
for
instance,
are
the
Ashanti
talking drums
described
by
Rattray, which transmit messages—not by code, an abstraction
impossible
to
a
primitive
people
lacking
letters,
but
by
mimicking the rhythm and pitch of speech on drums, so that
the drums literally talk.
However,
it would be dangerous
to build our foundations
on a hypothesis of this sort, which, however attractive,
is too
sweeping to be capable of rigorous proof* All that is assumed,
therefore,
is
the
general
evolution
of
a
written
civilised
literature from a special form of heightened language* At first
monopolising nearly all traditional literature,
this heightened

I
THE BIRTH OF POETRY
15
language,
as
civilisation
progresses,
becomes
confined
to
a
niche of its own.
In
its
early
stages
this
heightened language
is
usually in
association with music and the dance. Even such a self-conscious
literature
as that of Periclean Athens does not seem to have
seen any real distinction between poetry and music. Every form
of Greek poetry had
its appropriate musical, and in the case
of dramatic
poetry,
its
choreographic, accompaniment. This
liaison persists in a shadovy form to-day. Music and poetry
have long existed in their own right, but the frontiers overlap
in the region of song and dance music.
This
differentiation
and
specialisation
of
language
with
increasing civilisation is of course characteristic of all civilised
functions. The development of civilisation consists of a con-
tinually
differentiating
division
of
labour,
which
is
not
opposed to but is the cause of a continually integrating web of
social
economy.
Just
as
the human
body,
because
of the
specialisation of
its
parts,
is more highly
integrated by an
elaborate nervous system than a
jelly-fish, from which parts
can be severed which will continue to live, so the productive
basis of society grows in elaborateness and differentiation at
the same time as it becomes more and more unified. This
is
seen in any civilisation taken as a whole, which, as its economic
basis
elaborates
and
interpenetrates,
becomes
increasingly
differentiated in all
its cultural superstructure. Poetry, maid-
of-all-work in a simple
tribal economy, becomes in the rich
elaboration of a modem culture an activity which exists side
by side with the novel, history and the drama. This develop-
ment
will
give us
the
clue,
not merely
to
the meaning of
poetry, but also,
if we follow the successive trails as they open
up, to the significance in man’s life of all art and science. As
man’s
society
develops, we must
expect
his
art to show
a
corresponding
development,
and
therefore
to
reveal
with
increasing
clarity the implicit
qualities of man,
society and
culture which made this development possible.

l6
ILLUSION AND REALITY

How are we to judge whether a given society is more highly
developed than another? Is it a question of biological evolution?
Fisher has pointed out that there can be only one definition
of
*
'fitness^'
justified by biological considerations, and that
is
increase
of numbers
at
the
expense
of
the
environment,
including other species* In man this increase must depend on
the level of economic production—the more advanced this
is,
the more man will dominate his environment*
But
there
is only one
species
of man—Homo
sapiens—and
his level of economic production is unequal at different points
and develops in self-contained systems
of* various
sizes* This
inter-specific
difference
in mankind
is
just what
separates
humanity from other species, and makes biological standards
no longer the most important in the very department in which
we are interested—^tliat of culture. The non-biological change
of man, superimposed upon his relatively constant biological
make-up
during
historic
times,
is
the
subject
of
literary
history* This development is non-biological just because
it is
economic*
It
is the story of man's struggle with Nature,
in
which his increasing mastery of her and himself is due, not to
any improvement in his inborn qualities but to improvements
in systems of production,
including
tools,
the
technique of
using
‘ them,
language,
social
systems,
houses,
and
other
transmissible external structures and relations. This inheritance
is the vast concrete accumulation of "'human qualities" which
are not transmitted somatically but
socially. Mother wit
is
needed for their use, but
it
is a plastic force which inflates
these developing and transmitted
forms. Looked
at
in
this
way,
culture cannot be separated from economic production
or poetty from social organisation* They stand together in sliarp
opposition to the ordinary biological properties of species.
Poetry is to be regarded then, not as anything racial, national,
genetic or specific in
its essence, but as something economic.
We
expect
cultural
and
therefore poetical development
to
increase with the complexity of the division of labour on which
it is based* As yet no aesthetic standards have been introduced.
Complexity
is
not
an
aesthetic
criterion.
It

associated
only with
division
and
organisation
of
labour*
Among
primitives—^peoples
with whom
economic
pro-
duction
has
not passed
its
early
stage of food-gathering
or
hunting and
fishing—there
is less differentiation in function
than among more
historically-developed
peoples* The
only
differences of importance are
sexes,
age-grades and marriage'
classes
or
totemic
groups*
Each member
of
the
tribe
can
perform the social, magical and economic offices proper to his
sex, age or totem, providing of course that he is not ceremoni-
ally impure or outcast* Hence
it
is not surprising that their
formal language and their art are equally undifferentiated, and
that poetry, or heightened language,
is the common medium
of collective wisdom*
As to the exact process of differentiation, there is difference
of
opinion
among
anthropologists*
Even
the
Australian
aborigines
possess a culture obviously resulting from a con-
siderable period of historical development* Indeed the diffusion-
ists
see
in
it
traces
of
indirect Eg^tian
influence*
Frazer
visualises the process
as one by which the
clever primitive
appropriates
to himself magical
offices, and by
this means
becomes
a
priest or
god-king.
This
view
is
confused,
for
individual cleverness could not create permanent classes, unless
they played some part in the mechanism of social production*
This
in
fact the god-king did, being an important
class
in
agricultural organisation, but Frazer does not mention this*
Extrapolating into the
past, Durkheim
sees
the primitive
tribe as a homogeneous unit with a group consciousness, and
L^vy-Bruhl regards
this group
consciousness as
'^prelogical''.
Durkheim
imagines
such
a
primitive
tribe
to
be
almost
entirely undifferentiated, so that one can consider the members
as
without
character
or
individuality
except
the common
impress
of
the
tribe's
collective
representations,
which
are
coercive and overcome the individual s free thoughts*
This
is an abstract conception, since no such homogeneous
tribe can be found to-day. Abstractions of this kind are limits
to which society never fully attains* If this school had a clearer
idea of the connection between economic function and genetic
make-up
in
creating
characters
or
''types",
they would not
confuse,

so many
other
anthropologists,

with
individuation.
Individual
differences
are
genetic,
the
result of a particular pack of genes* Biologically speaking, they
are
^ Variations'
But
social
differentiation means
that
an
individual plays
a particular role in
social production* This
differentiation may be the very antithesis of individuation, for
by
it the individual may be pressed into a mould—whether
that of miner, bank clerk, lawyer or parson—^which is bound
to suppress some part of his native inividuality. He becomes
a type instead of an individual* An inherited character is forced
into an acquired mould* The greater the differentiation,
the
more specialised will be the mould and the more painful the
adjustment*
Psychologically,
as Jung has shown,
the process
takes place by
the
exaltation of one psychic function—that
most marked genetically, and therefore most likely to prove
economically remunerative* The hypertrophy of this function
and
its accommodation
to
the purposes of the
chosen pro-
fessional
type
result
in
the
wilting
of
the
other
psychic
functions, which eventually become largely unconscious, and
in the unconscious exercise an opposing force to the conscious
personality* Hence the typical ^hnodern" unease and neuroses*
Twentieth-century
civilisation,
the
creation
of
a
gospel
of
unadulterated economic individualism, has thus finally become
anti-individualistic* It opposes the full development of genetic
possibilities by forcing
the
individual
to mould a favoured
function
along
the
lines
of a
type whose
services
possess
exchange-value; so that for a refreshing contrast we turn (like
T* E* Lawrence) to a nomad civilisation such as that of the
Bedouins* Here genetic individuality, the character of a man,
is most respected and most highly developed; and yet it is just
here that economic differentiation is at a minimum*
Does
diis mean that biological individuality
is opposed to
economic
differentiation,
and
that
civilisation
fetters
the
free"
instincts—as the followers of Freud,
Adler, Jung and
D* H.
Lawrence by
implication
claim? No,
it
is
precisely
economic
differentiation, by
the
possibility of specialisation
that it affords, which gives opportunity for the most elaborate
development of the peculiarities or "variations"
constituting
the difference" of a biological
individual* But
this oppor-
tunity
presupposes
a
free
choice by any
individual
of the

I
THE BIRTH OF POETRY
19
complete range of economic functions* There
is no such free
choice in modern civilisation, because of its class structure* Not
only
is an
individual
heavily weighted
in
the
direction of
following an occupation approximately equivalent in income
and cost of training to that of his parents, but also a marked
bent for a slightly remunerative occupation (such
as poetry)
will be sacrificed to a slight bent for a markedly remunerative
occupation
(such
as company
promoting),
while
the
career
of being unemployed,
the involuntary function of so many
millions to-day, muffles
all useful variations*
It
is
not
ciyilisation
as such which by
its
differentiation
stifles genetic
individuality; on the
contrary,
its complexity
gives added scope for
its development and increases the sum
*
of
* ‘standard
deviation^^ One
incident
of
civilisation—the
development of classes in society and the increasing restriction
of choice of function for the individual—^holds back the very
development of individuality which
the
existing productive
forces could allow in a more fluid system of social relations*
Capitalism,
by making
all
talents and
gifts
a
commodity
subject to the inexorable and iron laws of the “free^' market,
now restrains that free development of the individual which its
vast productive forces could
easily permit,
if released* This
gives
rise
to
the
complaints
of
the
instincts
tortured by
civilisation which are investigated by Freud, Jung and Adler*
It is not surprising that a civilisation in which this rigidity
has become pathological and individuality has almost vanished
—as in the declining Egyptian and Roman Empires—collapses
before “barbarians"' at a lower stage of economic pr0duction
in which, however,
individuality has a freer rein* This
class
rigidity
is itself the reflection of a complete disintegration of
the economic foundations of a culture, in which the productive
forces, like men's imprisoned characters, are wasting themselves
in
a
sterile
quarrel with
the
iron
fetters of obsolete
social
relations*
Durkheim's
conception of a
tribe whose
consciousness
is
solid
crystal- and
undifferentiated,
corresponding
to
its
undifferentiated
economy,
in
its
absoluteness
misses
the
significance of genetic individuality as the basis of economic
differentiation,
just
as

ILLUSION AND REALITY

civilised man

ignores
the
importance
of economic
differentiation
as
a
fruitful
outlet
for
individuality*
Biologists
will
notice
here
a
significant
parallel
to
the
famous
dispute on
their own
science
over
^^acquired^^ and
^‘innate**
characters.
Durkheim
distinguishes
the
collective
representations
of
the tribe which constitute its collective mind, from individual
representations which constitute the individual mind, because
of the coercive character of the former* This error
is only the
fundamental error of contemporary philosophy which, by its
false conception of the nature of freedom, continually generates
the same stale antithesis. The consciousness made possible by
the development of society is not by its nature coercive; on the
contrary
this
consciousness,
expressed in
science and
art,
is
the means whereby man attains freedom. Social consciousness,
like social labour, of which it is the product and auxiliary,
is
the instrument of man s freedom* And it
is not the instincts
unadapted by society which are of their essence free; on the
contrary the unmodified instincts deliver man into the slavery
of blind necessity and unconscious compulsion.
Yet social consciousness is sometimes felt by men as coercive
—^why
is
this? Because
it
is a consciousness which no longer
represents social truth; because it is no longer generated freely
in the whole process of social co-operation. Such a conscious-
ness is the product of a class antagonism; it is the consciousness
of a class which by the development of the division of labour
and absolute property-right has become isolated from economic
production,
and
is
therefore maimed
and
obsolete*
This
consciousness now becomes the bulwark of privilege instead
of the spontaneous expression of social fact, and must therefore
be coercively enforced on the rest of society* Durkheim does
not see that this coercive type of group consciousness
is least
common with a primitive people, and most common with a
sophisticated civilisation*
We cannot help
noticing
already the connection of early
poetry—^poetry which is also tribal wisdom and rude chronology
—with a state of society in which economic differentiation due
to division of labour hardly exists. In primitive society man's

I
THE BIRTH OF POETRY
21
genetic individuality realises itself simply like a physical trait*
—a wide forehead or a splay
foot* Remembering that there
seems in
all ages something simple and direct about poetry,
that good poetry can be written by
the comparatively im-
mature, that it has a more personal and emotional core than
other forms of literary art, we may already guess that poetry
expresses
in a special manner the genetic instinctive part of
the individual, as opposed, say, to the noyel, which expresses
the individual as an adapted type, as a social character, as the
man realised in society* Such an art form as the novel could
therefore only arise in a society where economic differentiation
gives such scope
for the realisation of individual differences
that
it
is
useful and valuable to tackle man, the individual,
from this angle* There is no essential diflFerence;
it is a diflFer-
ence of aspect. But it
is an important difference, and one to
which we will return again and again. In this sense poetry is the
child of Nature, just as the developed novel is the child of the
sophistication of modern culture^
We must repeat the warning against mechanically separating
genetic
individuality from
social
differentiation*
One
is
a
means of realising the
other* In tragedy,
in dramatic verse,
and in the epic they unite, because these flourish at a time of
rapidly-changing
society,
a
society
in
which
older
class-
distinctions are cracking and man s genetic individuality,
his
passions,
his
instincts,
his blind
desires,
are
the means by
which new
economic
functions,
new
differentiations,
new
standard
types,
are
being
idealised and
realised*
Odysseus,
Oedipus and Hamlet are such figures of a social poetry, and
the problems these epics and tragedies resolve are the problems
peculiar to such a period of change.
All such problems
are problems concerning the nature of
freedom, and hence tragedy poses with overwhelming poignancy
the question of necessity, although in each culture the necessity
wears a different aspect,
for in each culture necessity presses
on men through different channels. The necessity that drives
on Oedipus
is wholly
different from
that which torments
Hamlet, and this difference expresses the difference between
Athenian and Elizabethan cultures* The same necessity, but
posed in a metaphysical way and with its solution postponed

All peoples present,
to ethnologists who
live among them,
distinct
individualities,
as
indeed do
animals. Among
rhe
Australian aborigines,
as
Gillen and Spencer have observed,
men
acquire reputations
for
special
types of socially
' useful
dexterity
and
exercise
it
to
an
extent
which
shows
that
differentiation
already
exists.
Some
division
of labour
has
appeared but it
is
still mainly genetic. It
is not produced by
a complex which moulds each generation, and
leads
to
the
formation of a class.
Thus,
as a rough type of the matrix in which poetry was
born, we take the average food-gathering or hunting tribe of
to-day
where
poetry
is
charm,
prayer
and
history.
This
undifferentiated group
shares
social
functions and
therefore
thoughts in common, and is bound by that “primitive passive
sympathy”
which
Kdliler has
observed
in anthropoid
apes,
and which McDougall
considers a
specific human
instinct.
With this group appears a heightened language, the common
vehicle of all that seems worthy of preservation in the experi-
ence of men.
We must think of this language, not as it looks recorded in
arid script, but as it was originally born, and as from age to age
it lived its group
life, accompanied by the rhythmic bearing
of drums, by dance and gesture, by the violent emotions of the
group
festival, a fountain of tradition in which not only the
living
group
participated,
but
also
all
the
ghosts
of dead
ancestors which
are a
tribe's
chief strength. From
this un-
differentiated
society
the
class-types
proper
to
the
priest,
lawyer, administrator and
soldier
arise by division of labour,
and, in the same way, the heightened language of die primitive
corroboree splits into science, history, theology, law, economics
and other appropriate divisions of cultural capital. In* doing so
each department evolves a special phraseology and method of

I
THE BIRTH OF POETRY
Z3
literary
attack which
not
only
differs from
tliose
of other
departments but
also from those of spoken speech* But the
departments are not watertight compartments* Their develop-
ment affects each other and also spoken speech, mutually and
continuously,
because
all
are rooted
in
the one
developing
complex of real social life.
For the sake of convenience we talk of heightened language.
But at this stage the adjective should not be allowed to carry
any tincture of a value-judgment. For any given people at any
given stage of evolution the precise heightening adopted can
be defined in objective terms of prosody, musical or choreo-
graphic
accompaniment,
or
the
use
of
special
words
not
permitted
for
profane
purpose.
As
yet we have found
no
reason why an imposed rhythm should improve
a language.
The reading of almost any manual of prosody will give grounds
for supposing that poetry is inferior to unhampered speech as
a vehicle of expression, but we claim as yet neither superiority
nor inferiority for prosody, only a qualitative difference, and
if it be asked why the language should be made. different, if it
was not intended to make
it better, an answer can be given.
The function of rhythm may be purely mnemonic. This
is
evidently the case in rhymed wisdom such as:
Red at night,
The shepherd's delight.
Red in the morning,
'pie shepherd's warning,
or
'
Ne'er cast a clout
Till May is out.
It was at one time supposed that the ^Taculty of attention'
was weak in primitive peoples, and that the rhythmic pattern
held their wandering
attention. Few modern anthropologists
would accept this view. Attention
is not a ‘Taculty" but an
instinctive component of psychic life, and if anything is more
powerful where intelligence
is
less. A cat stalking a bird, or
an Eskimo watching a seal blow-hole, show at least as much
attention as a modem scientist* watching an experiment. On
any matter that interests them—a ritual, dramatic performance

or a hunt—^primitive peoples show greater capacity for sustained
attention than more civilised groups. Rivers has recorded how,
during his researches among the Melanesians, he found that
an
interrogation
which
left him
exhausted
and
mentally
dispersed, found his source of information still fresh and ready
to keep up the supply. Yet as between two
civilised people,
it
is
almost
invariably
the
interrogated,
rather
than
the
interrogator, who tires first.
We
call the primitive's heightened language, which
is
as
it were speech in ceremonial dress, poetry, and we saw how in
the course of evolution
it became prosaic and branched into
history, philosophy, theology, the story and drama. This raises
a question whether poetry was ever anything but a reflection
of the
undiflFerentiated economy in which
it was born, and
whether poetry in its own right has now any real justification
for
existence. The fact that
it
still continues
to
exist
is no
complete answer,
since evolution
is
full of vestigial
organs,
and poetry may be one of these.
Poetry has an
increasingly
small
^ ^public". Alone in
literature,
it
clings
tenaciously
to
heightened language.
This might be
merely
the stigma
of
degeneration, as if poetry, like a mental deficient, still babbled
in a childish tongue outgrown by the rest of the family, which
has had to earn its living in an adult world.
We know there is a certain accident in the survival of poetry.
Men speak,
tell ancient tales, repeat bits of wisdom, and this
vanishes. Poetry in its heightened language survives, and there-
fore we
think of
it
as
* literature", making
too
artificial a
separation from the rest of social speech. This in turn may lead
us to overlook why poetry has a heightened language, why
it
survives, why it has a relative changelessness and eternity.
Primitive poetry
is not so much the matrix of subsequent
"literature",
as one pole of
it.
Because of its collective and
traditional nature,
it is the one which survives, and leads us,
who
see
in
it the
sole
literature of a primitive
people,
to
imagine a kind of golden age in which even the oracles speak
the language of epics.
What
is
the nature of this
other pole? A modem mind,
suryqi'ing the
primitive
scene,
and
noticing
all
the vague
aspirations, religious phantasies, mythological cosmologies and

I
THE BIRTH OF POETRY
collective
emotions
collecting
at
the
pole
of
rhythmical
language, would be disposed to think of the other pole as the
scientific pole* This would be the pole of pure statement, of
collections
of
facts
uncoloured
by
emotion:
pedigrees,
as-
tronomical
calculations,
censuses and
all
other
literary pro-
ductions which aim at a strong grasp of simple reality*
But science is not likely to seem the opposite of poetry to the
primitive mind* He does not know of science as a branch of
literature* He knows science only as a practice, a technique, a
way of building boats and planting trees which can best and
most
easily be learned through a kind of dumb
imitation,
because the practice is common to all the members of a tribe*
The idea of a statement devoid of prejudice and intended only
to be the cold vehicle of sheer reality is quite alien to that mind*
Words represent power, almost magical power, and the cold
statement seems to divest them of this power and substitute
a mirror-image of external
reality* But what difFerence,
save
of inferiority,
is there between the real object and its mirror-
image? The image of reality which the primitive seeks in words
is of a different kind:
it
is a magic puppet image^ such as one
makes of one's enemies* By operating on
it, one operates on
reality*
The primitive would defend in this way his lack of interest
in the
' 'photographic" scientific statement* It is a late abstrac-
tion in the history of thought,
a limit to which
all sciences
work,
but
only
fully
achieve
in
their mathematic
content,
perhaps not even then, except in so far as it is translated into the
logistic of Principia Mathematical
This
colourless
statement
is
alien
to
a mind shaped by
primitive
culture,
and
the
primitive
does
not
understand
language
without
a
purpose*
The
purpose
of
rhythmical
language
is
obvious—to
give him
that
feeling
of
internal
strength,
of communication with the gods,
that keeps him
in good
heart* The purpose of non-rhythmical
language
is
equally obvious* There
is no question of finding a function
for
it* The function
itself,
as in
all biological development,
created the organ and was shaped by
it* The need to extend
his personality, to bring it to bear on his neighbours, to bend
their
volitions
into harmony

immobility or attack, would have given birth to the gestures and
then
the
grunts
which
finally
became
articulate
speech*
Indeed Sir Richard Paget's plausible theory of the origin of
human speech
is based on
the assumption
that man,
with
tongue
and
other
movable
portions
of
his
vocal
organs,
attempted to imitate in gesture the images he wished to impose
on his fellows' minds.
The
function
of non-rhythmical
language,
then,
was
to
persuade*
Born
as
a personal
function, an
extension of one
individual
volition,
it can be
contrasted with the
collective
spirit of rhythmical language, which draws in primitive society
all
its power from
its
collective
appearance*
Poetry's
very
rhythm makes its group celebration more easy, as for example
in an infants'
class, which imposes prosody upon the multi-
plication
table
it recites, making mathematics poetical.
As with
all polar opposites the two interpenetrate, but on
the whole
the non-rhythmical language,
based
on
everyday
speech,
is the language of private persuasion, and rhythmical
language, the language of collective speech,
is the language of
public emotion.
This
is
the
most
important
difference
in
language at the level of primitive culture*
4
Poetry is characteristically song, and song is characteristically
something which, because of its rhythm,
is sung in unison^
is
capable of being the egression of a collective emotion. This
is one of the secrets of
^^heightened" language*
But why should the
tribe
need
a
collective emotion? The
approach of a
tiger, of a foe, of rain,
of an earthquake will
• instinctively
elicit a conditioned and collective response.
All
will be menaced,
all
will
fear* Any instrument
to produce
such
a
collective
emotion
is
therefore
unnecessary
in such
situations. The tribe, responds dumbly,
like a frightened herd
of deer.
But such an instrument is socially necessary when no visible
or tangible cause exists, and yet such a cause is potentiaL This
is how poetry grows out of the economic life of a tribe, and
how illusion grows out of reality.

I
THE BIRTH OF POETRY
27
Unlike
the
life of
beasts,
the
life
of the
simplest
tribe
requires a series of efforts which are not instinctive, but which
are demanded hy the necessities of a non-biological economic
aim—for
example a
harvest* Hence
the
instincts must
be
harnessed to the needs of the harvest by a social mechanism*
An important part of this mechanism
is the group
festival,
the matrix of poetry, which frees the stores of emotion and
canalises them in a
collective channel* The
real
object,
the
tangible aim—a harvest—^becomes in the festival a phantastic
object* The real object is not here now* The phantastic object
is here now—^in phantasy* As man by the violence of the dance,
the screams of the music and the hypnotic rhythm of the verse
is alienated from present reality, which does not contain the
unsown harvest, so he is projected into the phantastic world in
which these things phantastically
exist* That world becomes
more real, and even when the music dies away the ungrown
harvest has a greater reality for him, spurring him on to the
labours necessary for
its accomplishment*
Thus
poetry,
combined
with
dance,
ritual,
and
music,
becomes
the
great switchboard of the
instinctive energy of
the
tribe,
directing
it into
trains of collective actions whose
immediate causes or gratifications are not in the visual
field
and which are not automatically decided by instinct*
It
is
necessary
to
prepare
the ground
for
harvest*
It
is
necessary to set out on an expedition of war*
It
is necessary
to retrench and retract in the long scarcity of winter* These
collective
obligations demand from man
the
service
of his
instinctive energy, yet there is no instinct which tells him to
give them* Ants and bees store instinctively; but man does not*
Beavers
construct
instinctively;
not man*
It
is
necessary
to
harness man's
instincts
to the mill of labour,
to
collect his
emotions
and
direct them
into
the
useful,
the
economic
channel* Just because
it
is economic,
ue. non-instinctive, this
instinct must be
directed. The instrument which directs them
is therefore economic in origin*
How can these emotions be
collected? Words,
in ordinary
social life, have acquired emotional associations for each man*
These
words
are
carefully
selected,
and
the
rhythmical
arrangement makes
it possible to chant them in unison, and

28
ILLUSION AND REALITY
I
release
their
emotional
associations
in
all
the
vividness
of
collective existence. Music and the dance co-operate to produce
an alienation from reality which drives on the whole machine
of society* Between the moments when the emotion is generated
and raised to a level where it can produce *Vork'^ it does not
disappear* The tribal individual is changed by having partici-
pated in the collective illusion* He
is educated
Le. adapted
to tribal life. The feasts or corroborees are crises of adaptation
—some general and intended to last throughout life, such
as
the initiation or marriage ceremonies, others regularly renewed
or directed to special ends, such as the harvest and war festivals
or mid-winter Saturnalias*
But
this
collective emotion organised by
art
at the
tribal
festival,
because
it sweetens work and
is
generated by
the
needs of labour, goes out again into labour to lighten
it* The
primitive conducts such collective tasks
as hoeing, paddling,
ploughing, reaping and hauling to a rhythmic chant which has
an
artistic
content
related
to
the
needs
of
the
task,
and
expressing the collective emotion behind the task.
The increasing division of labour,
wliich includes also
its
increasing
organisation,
seems
to
produce
a movement
of
poetry away from concrete living, so that art appears to be in
opposition to work, a creation of leisure* The poet is typically
now
the
solitary
individual;
his
expression,
the
lyric* The
division of labour has led to a class society, in which conscious-
ness has gathered at the pole of the ruling
class, whose rule
eventually
produces
the
conditions
for
idleness*
Hence
art
ultimately is completely separated from work, with disastrous
results
to both, which can only be healed by the ending of
classes. But meanwhile the movement has given rise to a rich
development of technique.
These emotions,
generated
collectively,
persist
in
solitude
so that one man, alone, singing a song,
still feels his emotion
stirred by
collective
images* He
is
already
exhibiting
that
paradox of art—man withdrawing from his fellows
into the
world of art, only to enter more closely into communion with
humanity. Once made fluid, this collective emotion of poetic

the ancient freshness of the rose are enriched by all the complex
history of emotions and experience shared in common by
a
thousand generations* None of these reactions
is
instinctive,
therefore none
is personal. To the monkey, or the man reared
likeMowgli by a
wolfish foster-mother,
the
rose would be
something perhaps
edible,
a bright colour. To the poet
it
is
the rose of Keats, of Anacreon, of Hafiz, of Ovid and of Jules
Laforgue. For this world of art is the world of social emotion
of words and images which have gathered, as a result of the life
experiences of all, emotional associations common to
all, and
its increasing complexity reflects the increasing elaboration of
social life.
The emotions common to all change with the development
of
society. The
primitive
food-gathering
or
hunting
tribe
projects himself into Nature
to
find there
his own
desires.
He changes himself socially to conform with Nature. Hence
his art is naturalistic and perceptive. It is the vivid drawings
of Palaeolithic man or the bird- and animal-mimicking dances
and songs of the Australian aborigine. Its sign
is the totem
the man really Nature. Its religion is mana.
The crop-raising and herd-rearing tribe is an advance on this.
It takes Nature into itself and changes Nature to conform with
its own desires by domestication and taming.
Its art
is con-
ventional
and
conative.
It
is
the
arbitrary
decoration
of
Neolithic man or the elaborate rituals of African or Polynesian
tribes. Its sign is the corn-god or the beast-god’—Nature really
man. Its religion is one of fetishes and spirits.
The introduction of Nature into the tribe leads to a division
of labour and so to the formation of chiefs, priests and ruling
classes. The choreagus detaches himself from the
ritual and
becomes an actor—an individual. The art depicts noble persons
as well as gods. The chorus becomes an epic—a collective tale
about
individuals—and,
finally,
the
lyric—an
individual
utterance. Man, already conscious,
first of his difference, and
then of his unity with Nature, now becomes conscious of his
internal differences, because for the first time conditions exist
for their realisation.
Thus the developing complex of society, in its struggle with
the environment, secretes poetry as it secretes the technique of

harvest,
as
part of its non-biological and specifically human
adaptation
to
existence* The
tool adapts the hand
to a new
function, without changing the inherited shape of the hands
of humanity* The poem adapts the heart to a new purpose,
without changing the eternal desires of men's hearts*
It does
so by projecting man into a world of phantasy which is superior
to his present reality precisely because it is a world of superior
reality—a world of more important
reality not yet revised,
whose realisation demands the very poetry which phantastically
anticipates
it* Here is room for every error, for the poem pro-
poses something whose very reason for poetical
treatment
is
that we cannot touch, smell or taste it yet* But only by means
of this illusion can be brought into being a reality which would
not
otherwise
exist*
Without
the
ceremony
phantastically
portraying the granaries bursting with grain, the pleasures and
delights
of
harvest, men would
not
face
the
hard
labour
necessary to bring it into being* Sweetened with a harvest song,
the work goes well* Just because poetry is what it is, it exhibits
a reality beyond the reality it brings to birth and nominally
portrays, a reality which though secondary
is yet higher and
more complex. For poetry describes and expresses not so much
the grain in its concreteness, the harvest in its factual essence
which it helps to realise and which are the conditions for its own
existence—^but the
emotional,
social and
collective complex
which
is
that
tribe's
relation to
the
harvest*
It
expresses a
whole new world of truth—^its emotion,
its comradeship,
its
sweat,
its
long-drawn-out wait and happy consummation
which^has been brought into being by
the
fact that man's
relation to the harvest is not instinctive and blind but economic
and conscious* Not poetry's abstract statement—its content of
facts—^but its dynamic r61e in society—its content of collective
emotion—is therefore poetry's truth

n
THE DEATH OF MYTHOLOGY
I
We
have
reached
the
birth
of
religions*
This
collective
phantasy of poetry which passes into the individual life of each
because it is secreted in the web of society, again emerges (as
that web
is
differentiated out by division of labour) in the
form of an elaborate outgrowth, a world of religion separate
from the material world of terrestrial life*
Poetry
is the nascent self-consciousness of man, not as an
individual but
as
sharer with
others
of a whole world of
common emotion* This emotion, because it is common, has for
each
individual an
objective,
and
therefore
pseudo-external
existence* This social objectivity is confused by primitive man
with material objectivity, so that the phantastic world, because
it
is presented
to the individual
'^firom outside^
^ by outside
manipulation,
is
confused with
the
naaterial world
against
which he bumps himself* Other men confirm by their actions,
the
objectivity of a material world;
similarly they seem
to
confirm a like reality for the phantastic world whose sanctions
they recognise*
Man^s emotions are fluid and confusing* They are projected
into the outside world in animism, orondism and mana at his
primitive
stage of
culture,
not because he
is one with
his
environment, but because he has consciously separated himself
from
it in order to seek his desires in it by hunting or crop-
gathering*
Because
the
environment
is
already
something
consciously
distinct
from
himself,
he
is
concerned
with
locating
*
^things"
^
out
there
or
in
himself*
Because
these
collective emotions, unlike a pain or a wound but like a sunset
or a thunder-storm,
are manifestly experienced by
all,
they
gain the sanction of objectivity and therefore of material reality
and are located *'out there^^ in the object which arouses them*

ILLUSION AND REALITY
Man
enters
into
nature:
nature
becomes
^ ^animated''

What in
fact
is
this emotional complex of tribal
poetry?
Is it material reality or completely ideal illusion?
It is neither.
It
is a
social
reality.
It expresses the social relation of man's
instincts to the ungathered fruit. These instincts have generated
these emotions just because they have not blindly followed the
necessities of the germ plasm, but have been moulded by the
objective necessities of collective action to a common economic
end. The phantasy of poetry is a social image.
Therefore
the
phantastic world of poetic
ritual, myth
or
drama expresses a social truth, a truth about the instincts of
man as they
fare, not in biological or individual experience,
but in associated experience. Such truths are necessarily phrased
therefore in the language of the emotions. A pianola roll
is
pierced with holes. Those holes are real concrete entities. But
they are not the music. The music is what happens when it is
played. The poem is what happens when it is read*
Hence tribal poetry, and that part of religion from which it
is at
first indistinguishable,
is man's confused knowledge of
society and of his relation to it.
And magic? Man, conscious of his personal emotions, locates
the irregularity in the object which stimulates them, because
such
conscious
affects
as
terror and
desire
are
due
to
the
common experience of a tribe, are impressions common to all
individuals of the
tribe
in
relation
to
certain
things. The
emotion then seems located in these things and, because of its
immediate vividness, seems the soul,
the
essential
reality of
these
things.
Force,
the
kin-aesthetic
sensation of muscular
effort, even up to a late date dominated the thought of science,
and yet
expresses
this primitive
animistic way of regarding
nature.
Man's emotions are also in him. They therefore seem under
his control. They therefore seem to be the means whereby he
can dominate reality—through the emotional essence of things.
He, the individual, can dominate reality by his wilL By evok-
ing—through charms,
ceremonies
and sympathetic magic
the emotions proper to the achieved
act, he believes
the act
accomplished. It seems to him that he can control outer reality

II
THE DEATH OF MYTHOLOGY
33
by returning into himself* So indeed he can, but only if this
thought is scientific thought and, acting as a guide
to action,
returns out again to grapple with reality;
Because society stands as environment to individual man, and
as associated men to the environment, magic and religion overlap,
and
blend
more
closely
in
a
primitive
economy,
where
society is only slightly developed and is therefore a thin blanket
between the individual and outer reality*
Magic
gives
birth
to
science,
for magic commands
outer
reality to conform to certain laws, and reality refuses, so that
knowledge of the stubborn nature of reality
is impressed on
the magician* He does not try to walk upon the water with
spells, or if he does, the spells fail. Rainmakers are not found
in the desert, but in regions where rain sometimes comes. No
magician makes
spells
for
a
winter
harvest.
Thus
certain
stubbornnesses in reality for which stronger spells are needed
are
gradually
recognised;
and
so
it becomes
accepted
that
certain laws can only be overridden by mighty forces—^by gods,
by Fate, and eventually Fate dissolves
into that very decree
that these forces may not be overborne by anyone* Even Jove
is
subject
to
Fate.
Fate
is
law. Magic has turned
into
its
opposite, scientific determinism*
In proportion
as man, by the development of economics,
discovers more and more of the nature of reality, magic sets
itself bolder and more elaborate tasks, and more and more is
corrected by experience.
It proposes to man phantastic possi-
bilities, which man realises* But he does not realise them by
magic* Without the absurd ambitions of the shaman and the
impossible
hopes
of
the
alchemist,
the modern
chemistry
which
fulfils them would
not
be.
Always
the magician
is
defeated by *Tate^^ by the inexorable determinism of things,
and
it
is
precisely when
he
has become
conscious
of that
determinism, and magic has turned into science, that he is able
to do in reality the things magic only feigned* Illusion thus
plays into the hands of reality. Magic, promising freedom by
a blind pressure of the affects,
is realised when the emotional
content vanishes, when the magician s eyes are opened, and he
becomes conscious of the passionless causality of reality.
Magic can only
exist,
as
a
confused perception of outer

reality,
because man
is himself confused about his
relations
with
it* He has not distinguished himself from his environ-
ment—^subjective affects are confused with objective qualities*
How
does he
clear up
this
confusion? Not by mere
con-
templation, refusing to handle the pitch lest he become soiled*
He
separates
himself consciously from
his
environment by
struggling with it and actively interpenetrating it, in the course
of the development of economic life* When man has grasped
the nature of outer reality by his constant struggle with it in
economic
production,
then he
understands
clearly
the
dis-
tinction between environment and self, because he understands
their unity* He learns that man, as a machine,
is subject also
to necessity, and that the universe,
as a process,
is the theatre
of free development.

How can we separate religion from poetry in the childhood
*of the
race? Both have an economic
function and
a
social
content*
We can distinguish them because we find in poetry, in
all
ages, a characteristic we do not find in religion the more and
more clearly it emerges as **true^* religion. Poetry is productive
and changeful* The poetry of one age
does not
satisfy
the
next age, but each new generation (while appreciating the old
poetry) demands poems which more peculiarly and specially
express
its own problems and aspirations* Thus we have the
constant generation of a mass of songs,
stories, myths,
epics,
novels,
as a
peculiarity of poetic
life,
which
reveals
art
as
something organic and changeful, a flower on the social plant
developing and growing with the plant as a whole, because it
sucks the same sap, and performs an
office that benefits the
whole plant.
This incessant change of poetic art
is only possible because
the appreciator accepts the illusion as illusory* He accepts the
phantasy as expressing objective reality while immersed in the
phantasy, but, once the phantasy is over, he does not demand
that it be still treated as part of the real world* He does not
demand a correspondence of all stories and all poetic statements

n
THE DEATH
OF MYTHOLOGY
35
as he demands a correspondence between the experiences of
what he calls his real life*
The world may be fairyland in one story,
hell in another*
Helen may be seized by Paris in one epic, in another she may
elude him and die an honoured death in Egypt* Because of
this the poet and his hearer are not faced with die problem of
integrating the mock worlds of poetry with the real world of
everyday existence on the basis of the logical laws of thought
which by no means implies that no integration of ariy kind
takes place* But the poem or novel is accepted as an illusion*
We give to the statements of poetic art only a qualified assent,
and therefore reality has no vested interest in them* Because
of this there is no barrier to the fluent production which is the
life of art in all ages*
This
too
is
the
characteristic of religion, but only in the
early stage, when it is still merged with poetry* Religion is then
mythology and shows
all the spontaneous inventiveness and
recklessness
of
self-contradiction which
is
characteristic
of
mythology*
Why
does
mythology
show
this
organic
characteristic?
Because it
is organic* Because
it
is
still organically connected
with
society,
penetrating
every
pore*
Native
races who
see
an aeroplane presendy have a great white bird figuring in their
mythology*
Early
Christianity
shows
the
same
insurgent
proliferation of mythology so characteristic of art*
A new form of religion begins when the mythologising era
ends* The mytholog}’'
is taken over, but
it
ossifies*
Religion
has become
*‘true^^ religion*
It
is
plain
that mythology,
because of the
contradictions
it contains, can gain only a special kind of consent from the
primitive*
It demands from him
assent
to
the
illogical* So
far L^vy-Bruhl is correct* But this same illogical assent is given
by twentieth-century man to
the productions of poetry and
literary art* Hamlet lives for him* So do the Furies* So does the
Inferno* Yet he does not believe in an after-existence in hell or
in personal agents of retribution*
True, the assent is not of the same strength with twentieth-
century man* The gods live for the primitive in the collective
festival and the collective emotion* Because so
little division

36
ILLUSION AND REALITY
H
of labour exists, because society is still so undifferentiated, the
collective world of emotion in which the gods live penetrates
every hour of the individual's life. Not so with the worlds of
the theatre or the novel, which segregate themselves from the
more complex
social
life of men. The world of twentieth-
century art is more withdrawn—so much so that philosophers
continually conceive of
it
as
entirely
separate,
and advance
^'purely" aesthetic criteria—art for art's sake.
But though the strength of the assent
differs,
the quality
is the same. The world of literary art
is the world of tribal
mythology
become
sophisticated
and
complex
and
self-
conscious because man, in his struggle with Nature, has drawn
away from her, and laid bare her mechanism and his own by
a mutual reflexive action. Mythology with
its ritual, and art
with its performances, have similar functions—the adaptation
of man's emotions
to the
necessities of social
co-operation.
Both embody a confused perception of society, but an accurate
feeling of society. Mythology,
it
is
true,
has other functions.
But we are concerned here with the poetic content of myth-
ology,
which
afterwards
separates
itself out
as
a
distinct
sphere.
Because mythology so interpenetrates the daily
life of tlie
primitive,
it demands
no
overt,
formal
assent* No Holy
Inquisition rams
it down
people's
throats,
because
in
the
collective festival
it rises vividly from their hearts. Therefore
it is flexible. It yields and changes as the tribe's relation to the
environment or itself changes. The incursion of an aeroplane
or
a conqueror produces a corresponding adaptation
of the
collective mind by a recasting of the always fluid mythology.
Hence mythology has a ''self-righting" tendency;
it remains
on the whole true; it reflects accurately the collective emotional
life of the tribe in
its relations with the environment to the
degree in which the
tribe's own interpenetration of
its en-
vironment in economic production makes accuracy possible*
Why does
the age of mythology
as a real organic growth
give place
to the age of dogma and
"true"
religion when,
because the mythology must now be accepted as true, it ceases
to
reflect
the
continual movement of
reality and
tends
to
become
ossified and
dead?
Mythology

change and contradict itself, and is set up as something rigid
. and absolutely true* Faith, a virtue unknown to the primitive,
is necessary for its acceptance* Faith was not necessary to the
primitive because of his simple direct experience in the world
of
collective emotion*
Faith
is not
necessary
to
the
novel-
reader, because of his immediate direct experience in the world
of art* Faith becomes necessary when mythology ossifies into
'"true'^ religion* Faith and dogma are the signs of lack of faith
and suspicion of doctrine* They show that mythology has in
some way separated itself from society*
How has this come about? Only because society has separated
itself from
itself; because the matrix of religion has become
only a part of society, standing in antagonism to the rest of
society*
Because of this,
religion becomes
isolated from the
rest
of
society*
^^True*\ religion
marks
the
emergence
of
economic
classes
in
society*
The
end
of mythology
as
a
developing thing is the end of undifferentiated tribal life*

Marx has explained how
the
division of labour demands
a
class of overseers,
village headmen, managers of irrigation
works,
etc*,
whose
supervision,
as
differentiation
proceeds,
gradually passes from administration of the
social means of
production to that special right or privilege known as owner-
ship of them* The emergence of the ownership of the means
of production,
as
an
absolute
right,
distinct from
elective
administration of them at
society's behest, marks a definite
stage in the development of society, the stage of class society*
These
class divisions rend society in twain, and yet are the
only means by which society can pass to higher stages of pro-
ductive development until a stage is reached generating a class
whose economic circumstances enable it to end classes*
The
special
role
of the members
of the
ruling
class
as
supervisors gives them the means of directing into their own
lives all the goods produced by society, save for those needed
to
ensure
the
continued
existence
of
die
exploited
class*
Originally
chosen
as
supervisors

ability,
their
role,
even when

ILLUSION AND REALITY
II
therefore
independent
of
mental
capacity,
yet
demands
primarily mental work,
just as the working of the means of
production demands primarily manual work. At the same time
the privileged conditions and leisure afforded by consumption
of the lion s share of the social product encourages the cultiva-
tion of thought and culture among this class, while the hard-
driven and
beastly condition of the
other
class
discourages
this culture.
This rapidly generates a position of increasing
instability,
like that which causes “critical” vibration in engineering and
in the world of Nature produces in certain species a flare-up
of
unfavourable
adaptions—enormous
crests,
huge
hides,
colossal
tails and huge protuberances.
Like a snowball,
the
organism increases its own impetus to disaster.
In
the same way,
once
tire
formation
of
classes
due
to
division of labour passes a certain stage, the process of cleavage
is accelerated. The differentiation of the classes produces on
the one hand an exploiting class more and more isolated from
reality, more and more concerned with thought, with pleasure,
with culture, and on the other hand an exploited class more
and more
isolated from thought, more and more
laborious,
more and more subject to circumstances.
This specialisation of function, at first beneficial, eventually
becomes
pathological.
Thought
originally
separated
itself
from
action,
but
it only develops by continudly returning
upon action. It separated from action to guide
it. Once from
supervisors
and
leaders
the
exploiting
class
turn
to
mere
enjoyers and
parasites,
thought
has
finally
separated
itself
from material
reality, and
ossifies in a
barren formalism or
scholasticism. And once from partners and fellow-tribesmen
the
exploited
class
turns
to mere
slaves,
action has
finally
separated itself from thought and becomes blind mechanism.
This is reflected in the life of society as a whole by the decay
of
culture,
science and
art
in
formalism and
Alexandrine
futility, and the decay of economic production in inefficiency
and anarchy. Egypt, China, India, the declining Roman Empire,
are
all examples of this degeneration.
This
division of .the undifferentiated
tribe into a
class of
supervisors who exercise thought, and a class of workers who

II
THE DEATH OF MYTHOLOGY
39
only work,
is reflected by a similar dichotomy in religion and
art* Religion and art cease to be the collective product of the
tribe, and become the product of the ruling class who impose
a religion just as they impose an act*
A tribe does not give orders to
its members to work; their
work naturally
arises from the
collective functioning of the
group as a whole, under the pressure of tradition and religion
whose genesis we have already examined* Any problem or job
can only be solved according to the interests of the tribe as a
whole because the
tribe
is
a whole* But when
interests
are
divided, the ruling class orders the ruled* The relation is now
,coercive*
In
the same way
religion becomes
dogma*
As
the
class
society
forms,
religion,
which
continues
to
function
as
a
confused
perception
of
society,
produces
a new and more
elaborate world of phantasy but one now with a class structure*
There is a supreme god in a monarchical society, or family of
gods in an autocracy, or a pantheon in a state such as Egypt
formed
by
the
syjicresis
of
various
developed
class
units
already godded* There are heavenly peers, scribes, priests and
captains,
corresponding to the division of the earthly ruling
class*
Meanwhile the unequal division of goods and the opposed
class
interests
have
created
an
antagonism
which
divides
society* There are outbreaks, rebellions and revolts which must
be crushed* Absolute ownership of the means of production,^
not being thrown up as a natural response to the task confront-
ing the tribe
as
a whole,
is arbitrary, and depends therefore
ultimately on violence* It is not made necessary by things and
is therefore enforced by men* In the same way class religion,
no longer expressing the collective adaptation of society, must
be equally arbitrary* It becomes dogma* A challenge to it is a
challenge to the State* Heresy is a civil crime*
The ruling class now seems to dispose of all social labour*
With
a highly-developed agriculturd
civilisation a god-king
is formed at the top of the pyramid, and he seems to wield all
social power* The slave by himself seems very small compared
with the might of social labour wielded by the god-king* In
association the slave wields a tremendous power,
the power

ILLUSION AND REALITY
11
40
of building pyramids* But
this power does not seem
to the
slave to be his; it seems to belong to the god-king who directs
it* Hence the slave humiliates himself before his own collective
power; he deifies the god-king and holds the whole ruling class
as
sacred* This
alienation of self is only a reflection of the
alienation
of property which
has
produced
it* The
slave's
humility
is the badge not merely of his slavery, but of the
power of a society developed to a stage where slavery exists and
yields a mighty social power* This power
is expressed at the
opposite pole to the slave by the divine magnificence of the
god-kings of Egypt,
China, Japan, and the Sumerian, Baby-
lonian and Accadian city-states* In a syncretic empire like that
of Rome,
other religions can exist beneath the State cult of
the worship of the Emperor* These local
cults express
local
forms of exploitation on which Imperialist
exploitation has
been imposed, and only a challenge to the god-Emperor
is a
challenge
to
Imperial
exploitation and
therefore
a crime
in
Roman law. As Marx, studying the phenomenon of religion,
had
perceived
as
early
as
1844:
‘*This
State,
this
society,
produces
religion—an inverted
consciousness of the world
because
the world
is
itself an
inverted mrld. Of
this world
Religion is the general theory,
its encyclopaedic compendium,
its
logic
in
popular
form,
its
spiritual
point
Hhonneur^
its
enthusiasm,
its moral
sanction,
its solemn complement,
its
general
consolation
and
justification*
It
is
the
phantastic
realisation of man,
hecmse man possesses no true realisation*
*
.
* Religious misery is at once the expression of real misery
and a protest against that real, misery.
As
society,
increasingly rent by
this
class
division,
enters
on
a period
of failing economy
like
that of the
declining
Roman
Empire,
the
goods
produced become
less and
the
share-out
more
and more
coercive.
Therefore
religion
too
becomes more and more coercive, more rigid, more tremblingly
alive to heresy*
At first the ruling class believes
its religion, for differentia-
tion from a primitive mythology has only just taken place* It
endeavours therefore to appropriate for itself all the goods of
religion, as it is already doing those of society* The best seats

in Heaven
are
taken,
or—as with the
early
rulers of Egypt
and the aristocracy of Greece—^the, Elysian fields are monopol-
ised by them* But as this ruling class is challenged by a restive
exploited
class,
the
exploiting
class
appeases
it by
sharing
with
it
its own
spiritual
goods,
for
these,
unlike
material
goods, do not grow
less
for being
shared* Hence in Egypt
immortality
was
gradually
extended
even
to
slaves;
and
mystery
religions,
in
the
decaying
Empire,
offered
to
the
meanest the deification at
first peculiar to the god-Emperor*
Thus the increasing misery of the exploited class
is reflected
in the increasing loveliness of its
after-life, provided
it leads
the good life
i.e. one obedient to
its employers* The harvest
of phantasy, which in tribal life
is always eventually reaped,
is for the majority in a class society postponed to a phantastic
after-life,
because the
real
harvest ^so
is not consumed by
the majority*
This
increasing
consciousness
of the
function
of religion
leads
to
scepticism on
the
part
of the
ruling
class
itself,
which coercively enforces a religion
it no longer believes
in,
and
itself
takes
refuge
in
an
elegant
idealism
or
esoteric
philosophy*
Beneath the official religion, which can no more be changed
than the system of productive relations which has generated it,
lurks a whole undergrowth of ^‘superstition
' and “legend''*

Spirit, and,
if not of an undivided society,
at least of an un-
divided class. It is the poetry of religion at a time when religion
itself ceases to be poetic. It is the art of the oppressed. Though
it fulfils the function of poetry in adapting man's instincts to
social
life,
it cannot be great poetry, for it is no
lie that great
poetry can only be written by the
free. This poetry moves
within the boundaries of wish-fulfilment. Its creators have too
little
spontaneity
in
their
life
to
be
greatly
conscious
of
necessity. It is not therefore ever tragic poetry.
Tribal
mythology
was
free
and
poetic
because
the
un-
differentiated economy of the tribe made its members' actions
relatively free. This freedom was true freedom—the conscious-
ness of necessity. The job demanded evidently such actions,
and they were done spontaneously—by the individual's con-
sciousness of their necessity. Of course this freedom
is only
relative.
It
reflects
the limited consciousness produced by a
limited economy. The divisions of class society were necessary
to
break
the
soil
for
a
deeper
consciousness and
a
higher
freedom. But still primitive freedom is freedom—such freedom
as human society in that stage can know, a stage where, because
the economy is undifferentiated, the limited freedom, like the
limited product,
is
at
least equally shared by
all. Poetry or
poetic mythology, fluid and spontaneous, grows in such soil.
In a class society the workers do their tasks blindly as they
are told by supervisors. They build pyramids but each contri-
butes a stone; only the rulers know a pyramid is being built.
The Scale of the undertakings makes possible a greater con-
sciousness of reality, but this consciousness
all gathers at the
pole of the ruling class. The ruled obey blindly and are unfree.
The rulers arc free in the measure of their consciousness.
Therefore
tlie
exercise of art becomes more and more
their
exclusive prerogative,
reflecting their aspirations and
desires*
Religion is ossified by the need of maintaining a class right and
therefore
art now
separates
itself from
religion.
Moreover,
religion is already disbelieved by the ruling class because of its
openly exploitive character. The ossification of religion and the
growth of scepticism
in
a
class
society
is
therefore always
accompanied by a flourishing of art, the art of the free ruling
class, an art which sucks into itself all the fluid, changeful* and

11
THE DEATH OF MYTHOLOGY
43
adaptive characteristics of primitive religion. Religion
is now
primarily an expression of class coercion, an expression of real
misery and a protest against that real misery, while art is now
the emotional expression of the ruling class. Sophisticated art
of the exploiters sets itself up against die fairy tale and folk art
of the exploited. Both flourish for a time side by side.
This stage
itself is only transitory. For as the ruling
class
becomes more and more parasitic, and delegates increasingly
its work of supervision,
it itself becomes less free. It repeats
formally the old consciousness of yesterday, yet the reality
it
expressed has changed. The class
is no longer truly conscious
of reality, because it no longer holds the reins, whose pressure
on its hands guided it. The exercise of art, like the exercise of
supervision, becomes a mechanical repetition by stewards and
servants of the forms,
functions and operations of the past.
Art perishes in a Byzantine formality or an academic conven-
tionality
little better than religious dogma. Science becomes
mere pedantry—little better than magic. The ruling class has
become blind and therefore unfree. Poetry grows in no such
soil.
The exploited class too, as this occurs, become more exploited
and more miserable. The decay of economy, due to the decay
of the ruling class, produces a sharper and more bitter exploita-
tion. The cleavage between the rulers and the ruled makes the
life of the ruled more mechanical and slavish, and unfree. A
peasant or small landholder economy changes to an economy
of overlords and serfs. To produce even ^Tolk*^ art and
^ ^super-
stition"^ a limited spontaneity
is necessary. Unlike a class of
nomads, smallholders or burghers, a class of slaves has no art.
The still essential function of adaptation is now performed for
men"s minds by a religion whose fixed dogmatism and super-
stitious faith expresses the lack of spontaneity of the ruled and
their diminished consciousness.
Such collapses are not necessarily complete, for between the
ruling class and the class which bears the brunt of the exploita-
tion, other classes may develop, in turn to become the ruling
class as a result of a revolution. Ossified religions are challenged
by heresies which succeed precisely because they express the
interests of another class formed secretly by the development

of economy and soon to supersede the old. Such heresies are
fought as what they are—a challenge to the. very existence of
the ruling class.

Poetry,
then,
cannot be separated from the society whose
specifically human activity secretes
it. Human activity is based
on the instinctive. But those forms of human activity which are
most changeful and least dependent on instinct are highest and
most human. These activities, because they are based on the
inheritance from generation to generation of developing forms
and systems which are real and material and yet are not environ-
mental in the biological sense, mould in a difiFerent way each
new generation, which
is not however mere clay,
for its own
inner activity drives on the movement of die external system.
This
contradiction between individual or
natural man, and
associated or civilised man, is what makes poetry necessary, and
gives
it its meaning and
its truth. Poetry
is a productive or
economic activity of man. To separate it from this foundation
makes
its development impossible to understand.
How far do men’s own estimates of the function of poetry
at various times agree with our analysis? It has been generally
realised by poets such as Milton, Keats, Shelley or Wordsworth
that the poet as “seer”, “prophet” or “teacher” had a social
function of importance. This was not expressed precisely but
in a metaphorical way, a poetic way, in which the resounding
magnitude of the
claims
concealed a
certain vagueness and
poverty of social insight. Indeed the conditions of bourgeois
economy—under which
poetry
tends,
like
everything
else
hitherto thought sacred, to become a commodity, and the poet,
hitherto drought inspired, tends to become a producer for the
anonymous
free market—these
conditions make
it
almost
impossible for any critic who remains within the categories of
bourgeois thought to penetrate the idealistic veils with wliich
poetry in the modem
era has concealed her commercialised
shame.
Yet it is impossible to appeal to primitive self-appraisement,
for literary criticism cannot exist among the unself-conscious
primitives—the undifferentiated state of their society makes it

unnecessary* The criticism is direct and dumb and efficacious
—the valuation of the poet
is expressed by the place he
is
voluntarily
accorded
in
tribal
society,
the
valuation of the
poems by their repetition and survival*
In Athens of the fifth century B*c* a society had emerged
which, although it was still sufficiently near to primitive society
to be
conscious
of the
social
function of poetry,
was
also
sufficiently diflFerentiated to be able to separate poetry off as a
distinct
‘*sphere^^ of culture*
Poet
as producer
is not yet a
trade, because Athens is not a capitalistic town engaged chiefly
in commodity production*
It
is a port, a centre of exchange*
The
vending
of poems
is
therefore
a
trade—the
trade
of
rhapsodist or paid reciter*
It is a society in ferment, in revolution. The developing com-
merce of the Aegean
is producing a class of merchants and
slave-owners who are displacing the old land-owning aristocracy*
In Athens already the qualifications for rule have ceased to be
based on land, and are now based on money income; and this
brings it in sharp opposition to Sparta* From a market town
and residence of nobles which was a mere appendage of the
estates of Attica, Athens has become a town in its own right,
a centre of merchants and artisans* This
is regarded by the
Hellenes as a change from an ^^oligarchy^^ to a *^democracy^^
As
in later transitions of the same kind,
it has taken place
through a transitional period of strong, centralised government
or "'tyranny'' like the Tudor monarchy* The "democracy" of
course
is
extremely
qualified—^it
is a democracy of men of
property* The proletariat has no franchise*
Unlike a somewhat similar stage in medieval economy—^the
transition from feudalism
to
capitalism—this
is not a
class
struggle which ends with the clear victory of the revolutionary
class,
but
rather with the "mutual ruin of the contending
classes"* The struggle between the oligarchs and the democrats,
between Athens and Sparta,
tears Greece to fragments* It is a
struggle between town and country, between slave latifundia
and slave-town*
Because
it remains within the
categories of
slave-owning,
it
is incapable of a final solution* No decisive
stroke
is possible such as the freeing of the tied serfs which
provides the basis of the bourgeois revolution* Neither class can

completely undermine the foundations of the other,
for both
are based on slavery, and slavery of a similar character*
Culture is
still sufficiently undifferentiated for one man to
survey the whole, and Plato and Aristotle stand out as philoso-
phers surveying the whole field of culture, including that of
literary art* Both were fortunate in that they were born before
the class struggle was reaching its final sterile issue in Greece*
There had recently been an alliance between the classes against
the common enemy, Persia, and the alliance was still dynamic
and creative*
Plato, spokesman of the oligarchic
class,
reacts
creatively upon Aristotle, who voices the aims and aspirations
of the newer class, more tough-minded, more practical, more
in touch with
reality*
It was no
accident
that
Aristotle of
Stagira had been so closely allied with Philip and Alexander, for
if at last his class were to score a more solid triumph, and to
emerge somewhere as conquerors,
it was only by bursting the
confines of the city and ruling beyond the bounds of Greece in
the Hellenistic empires of Alexander’s heirs*
Aristotle
clearly
sees
the
primitive
distinction
between
private
and
public
speech,
between
non-rhythmical
and
rhythnoical language, between individual persuasion and collec-
tive emotion* Indeed to a Greek of that time the distinction
appeared so self-evident and practical that it needed no explana-
tion* On the one hand was the great instrument of Rhetoric
whereby an individual swayed his fellow men; on the other
hand
the world of
Poetics
wherein men
were
collectively
moved to emotion*
Aristotle writes about both
like a man
writing a text-book on a useful and important human activity*
Aristotle’s view of Rhetoric is simply this—the art of Per-
suasion* But he makes it clear that he has chiefly in mind the
obvious and impressive public occasions where the art of per-
suasion is needed—^in the law courts and the political assemblies*

occasions, must be distinguished from the
publicity of poet^* It is the publicity of State occasions where

the
city from men* The occasions when men use the State

THE DEATH OF MYTHOLOGY
47
Aristotle considered as separate from the occasions when one
man
speaks
to
others
to
persuade them about
the normal
incidents of daily life. The development of classes has made
the city a *‘targ.er of men^^ something already towering above
society as a structure separate and imposed on it, a view which
was to reach
its zenith with the Hegelian conception of the
absolute State. But it is already implicit in Socrates^ refusal to
flee the city^s judgment of death. In this refusal, Socrates fore-
casts
that the
class struggle was doomed
to destroy Greece,
because the
city could not generate a class or even one man
able to look beyond the city.
Aristotle's treatment of Poetics requires a more detailed con-
sideration. He deals with a primitive poetry already in process
of differentiation in odes, dramas, epics and love poetry, and
already
distinct frpm
rhetoric; and he
therefore looks
for a
characteristic common
tO“ poetic
creations which will
distin-
guish them as a species from the non-poetic. An obvious charac-
teristic of poetry to the Greeks was that
it told some sort of
story. It made some statement about the ways of gods or men
or the emotions of the poet which, even thotigh it was not true,
seemed
true. The
epic
is
a
false
history, and the drama a
feigned action. Even in love poetry the poet may justly say
die for love of Chloe" when no Chloe exists. The essence of
poetry therefore seemed to the Greeks to be illusion, a conscious
illusion.
To Plato diis feature of the poet's art appeared so deplorable
that he would not admit poets to his Republic, or at least only
if their productions were
strictly censored. Such reactionary
or Fascist philosophies as Plato's are always accompanied by a
denial of culture, particularly contemporary culture, and Plato's
contemporary culture was pre-eminently poetic. He therefore
hates poetry as a philosopher even though he is charmed by it
as a man. In a revolutionary period culture expresses the aspira-
tions of the revolution or the doubts of the dispossessed. The
philosophers of the dispossessed regard both the aspirations and
the doubts as ^'dangerous", or '^corrupt", and want a culture
which shores up their rottenness. Such a culture idealises the
past in which they were strong. This ideal past does not bear
much likeness to the real past, for it is one carefully arranged

SO
that,
unlike the
real
past,
it will not again generate
the
present. For Plato this past is idealised in his Republic, ruled by
aristocrats and practising a primitive communism which is the
way Plato hopes to undermine the trade by which the rival class
has come to power.
The Greeks reasoned that poetry was designed to create an
illusion.
Evidently
then
the
poet made
something
which
created
the
illusion,
even
if the
something
was
fabulous.
He made
stories
actually
visible on the stage
or,
as
in the
Homeric cycle, a history more real than the transactions of the
market-place,
the
reallest thing in the
collective
life of the
Hellenes. This creation the Greeks rook to be the special mark
of the poet. The very name etymologically was derived from
"making”, just as was the Anglo-Saxon word for poet
niakar:
To build from matter is sublimely great,
But only gods and poets can create.
, However,
the Greeks did not suppose
that
a poet could
create something out of nothing by words, which
are
only
symbols
of
reality.
They
considered
the
poet
created
an
artificial imitation of reality, a mimesis. For Plato the poet* is
essentially a man who mimics the creations of life in order to
deceive his hearers with a shadow-world. In this the poet is like
the Demiurge, who mocks human dwellers in the cavern of life
with shadows of reality.
This theory of mimesis gives Artistotle the specific mark to
differentiate between
the
class of rhetoric and the
class of
poetry. Though
it
is,
to our modem minds, imperfect
as a
distinction, owing to the differentiation which has taken place
in
literature
since
then,
it was
an adequate
distinction
in
Aristotle’s day.
We separate poetry from the novel and drama; he did not.
But the categories of literature are not eternal, any more than
the classifications of systematic biology; bodi must change, as
the objects of systematisation evolve and alter’in the number
and characteristics of their species. Culture changes faster than
species, and cultural criticism must be correspondingly flexible.
, Aristode’s theory of mimesis, as our analysis will show, so far

from being superficial,
is fundamental for an understanding of
the function and method of art*
Aristotle, with his
extraverted mind turned firmly on the
object, was more interested in the created'^thing, e.g. the play
than in the man who was influenced by it or who produced it*
Thus his angle of attack
is
aesthetically correct; he does not
approach literature like a psychologist or a psycho-analyst*
Plato, with the more intuitive, introverted mind, is interested
in the poet and in his hearer rather than the composition itself*
His conception of the productive and receptive states of the
poetic mind is primitive, corresponding to the more reactiona^
character of Plato's thought,
but behind the
barbarity
is
a
cultured
snigger
which
is
characteristically
Platonic*
The
barbarity rather than the culture makes Plato
to some extent
a spokesman of the primitive view of the poet's r61e, at a time
when poetry is passing, as a result of the invention of writing,
from a collective to a private phase*
Plato, belonging to the older world of Athens,
is not aware
of
the
change* He does
not
see
that
the development
of
Hellenic economy makes
the poem an
object
of exchange
between cities and people, like Athenian vases* The poem
is
no longer, as in old Athenian tragedy, rooted in a collective
festival where actors and audience are simultaneously plunged
into an associated world of art* Neitzsche's passage from the
Dionysian to the Apollonian in art has already taken place as
a result of the passage of Athens from the primitive to the
sophisticated,
the differentiated* Poems
are now separate
from
the body of
society,
to be enjoyed by
individuals
or
groups separate from society* And the invention of writing,
made
necessary by the development of economy
to
a
stage
where records and messages were essential because records were
no
longer
the
collective memory of the
tribe and men no
longer lived in common,
led to
written poems, not
simply
because
writing was
invented,
but
because
the
needs
that
demanded
writing
also demanded
that
poetry be
detached
from the collective festival and be enjoyed by men alone*With
Euripides even drama becomes a
closet
art*
Plato, however,
was only conscious of this in a general way, as expressed in his
condemnation of books and the art of writing* Plato's criticisms
D

are like D. H. Lawrence's, they reach back to the past, to the
time of an
undifferentiated
society and
collective
emotion.
They are correct but useless because the critic is unaware that
what he condemns is a product of a class differentiation rooted
in economy. He does not therefore reach forward to a solution
of present
difficulties, but backwards
to a time before those
difficulties arose. But one cannot put back the clock of history.
Plato is the most charming, humane and civilised of Fascist
philosophers, corresponding to a time before the aftermath of
the PeloponnesianWar had made reaction murderously bitter.
In
this
respect he
is an
Athenian
Hegel. No
reactionary
philosopher of to-day could attain Plato’s urbanity or charm.
This is Plato’s conception of the poet:
Socrates
is speaking to Ion, a rhapsoiist:
It is a divine influence which moves you,
like that which resides in the
stone called Magnet by Euripides, and Heraclea by the people. For not only
does
this stone possess the power of attracting iron rings, but
it can com-
municate to them the power of attracting pther rings; so that you may see
sometimes a long chain of rings and other iron substances, attached and sus-
pended one to Ae other by diis influence. And as the power of the stone
circulates through all the links of the series, and attaches each to each, so the
Muse,
communicating through those whom she has
first inspired,
to
all
others capable of that first enthusiasm, creates a chain and a succession. For
the authors of those great poems which we admire, do not attain to excel-
lence through the rules of any art, but they utter their beautiful melodies of
verse in a state of inspiration, and, as it were, possessed by a spirit not their
own. Thus the composers of lyrical poetry create those admired songs of
theirs in a state of divine insanity, like the Corybantes, who lose all control
of their reason in the enthusiasm of the saaed dance;
and,
during
this
supernatural possession, are excited to the rhythm and harmony which they
communicate to men. Like the Bacchantes who, when possessed by the god,
draw honey and milk from the rivers, in which, when they come to their
senses, they find nothing but simple water. For the souls of the poets, as
poets tell us, have this peculiar ministration in the world. They tell us that
these souls, flying like bees from flower to flower, and wandering over the
gardens and the meadows and the honey-flowing fountains of the Muses*
return to us laden with the sweetness of melody; and, arrayed as they are in
the plumes of rapid imagination, they speak truth. For a poet is indeed a
thing
ethereally
light, winged and sacred, nor can he compose anything
worth' calling poetry until he becomes inspired, and,
as
it were, mad, or
whilst any reason remains in him. For whilst a man retains any portion of
the thing called reason, he
is utterly incompetent to produce poetry or to
vaticinate.

choral, epic, or iambic, is excellent in proportion to the extent of his partici-
pation in the divine influence, and the degree in which the Muse itself has
descended upon him. In other respects, poets may be sufficiently ignorant
and incapable. For they do not compose according to any art which they
have acquired, but from the impulse of the divinity within them; for did
they know any rules of criticism according to which they could compose
beautiful verses upon any one subject, they would be able to exert the same
faculty in respect
to
all or any
other. The god seems purposely to have
deprived all poets, prophets, and soothsayers of every particle of reason and
understanding,
the
better
to
adapt them
to
their employment
as
his
ministers and interpreters; and that we,
their auditors, may acknowledge
that those who write so beautifully* are possessed, and address us inspired by
the god*i
Here Plato shows poetry to be something different in kind
from conscious rhetoric, the art of persuasion, which, according
to Greek views,
could be reduced
to rule and learned. But
poetry can never be learned,
for according to Plato
it
is not
a conscious function, with rules of criticism, but an inpouring
of the god, and he is sufficiently near to primitive culture to
place the poet beside the prophet and the soothsayer. Moreover,
according to Plato's view this inspiration is not only essential
for the poet, but for his reader. The rhapsodist who declaims
him, and the auditor who
is affected by him, must also be
inspired by the god. In other words, not only the writing but
also the appreciation of poetry is an unconscious (or irrational)
function. To
Plato
all deception
is a form of enchantment.
Poets
are
wizards
wielding
quasi-religious
powers.
Plato's
symbol of the magnetised rings well expresses the
collective
character of primitive poetry. In contrast to
Aristotle,
Plato
the idealist
is concerned with the enjoyment rather ^than the
function of poetry.
Aristotle, however,
is uninterested in the poet's mind, and
does not concern himself with whether or not the
creation
and appreciation of poetry is a conscious function. He judges
it by results, by poems. He systematises them, analyses them,
and reduces them to rule. He finds that mimesis
is the dis-
tinguishing features of Poetics, and he investigates the rules
for producing a convincing and successful mimesis.
Unlike Plato, he goes fiirther. As befits a philosopher who

Studied the constitutions of existing
states, he asks: what
is
the social function of tragedy?
His answer
is well known*
Its
effect
is
cathartic—purging*
The answer
is somewhat enigmatic, once one attempts
to go
behind
it* It
is tempting to give to the expression a modern
interpretation* It has been suggested, for example, that this
is
merely the basic therapy of Freudism—therapy by abreaction
—^in a Greek dress* This is on the one hand an over-refinement
of Aristotle, and on the other hand a misunderstanding of what
therapy by abreaction actually
is* Poetic creations,
like other
phantasies, may be the vehicle of neurotic conflicts or com-
plexes* But a phantasy is the cloak whereby the ‘^censor*' hides
the
unconscious
complex.
So
far
from
this
process
being
cathartic, it is the opposite according to Freud^s own principles.
To cure the basic complex by abreaction the phantasy must be
stripped of
its
disguise and the
infantile and archaic kernel
laid bare.
Thus the poetic construct, according to Freud^s own empirical
discoveries, cannot represent an abreactive therapy even for the
poet.
But
Aristotle
visualises
tragedy
as
cathartic
for
rhe
spectators. Even if the poetic phantasy did have an abreactive
effect on the poet, it is impossible that every spectator should
have, not only the same complex
as the poet, but the same
associations, which analysis shows are generally highly personal.
Hence
followers
of
Freud who
suggest
that
Aristotle's
catharsis
is the equivalent of Freud's
therapy
by
abreaction, not
only
misunderstand
Aristotle,
but
also
are
imperfectly
acquainted with the empirical
discoveries on which psycho-
analysis rests.
It
is
best,
in
fact,
not
to
go
behind
Aristotle's
simple
conception, until we ourselves are clear as to the function of
poetry, and can compare Aristotle's ideas with our own* How
Aristotle arrived at his definition
is
fairly
clear. On the one
hand he saw
tragedy
arousing
unpleasant
emotions
in
the
spectator—fear and anxiety and grief. On the other,hand these
same spectators went away feeling the better for it, so much so*
that they returned for more* The emotions, though unpleasant,
had done them good. In the same way unpleasant medicaments
do
people
good,
and
perhaps
Aristotle went
further,
and

II
THE DEATH OF MYTHOLOGY
53
visualised
the tragedy concentrating and driving out of the
mind the unpleasant emotions,
just
as
a purge concentrates
and
drives
out of the body the
unpleasant humours.
This
highly
practical attitude towards
tragedy
is not
only,
as
it
seems to me, healthy, and good literary criticism, but essenti-
ally Greek.
If the tragedy did not make the Athenians
feel
better, in spite of its tragedy,
it was bad. The tragic poet who
made them weep bitterly at the fate of their fellow Hellenes in
Persia was fined. A similar imposition suggests
itself for our
own purely sentimental war literature.
This,
then, was the intelligent Greek view of literature as
the differentiation, carried so far in our own culture, had just
begun. On
the one hand
Rhetoric,
the
art
of
persuasion,
exercised consciously and appreciated consciously, an art which
was simply ordinary conversation hypostatised ,by the hypos-
tasis of the city-state. On the other hand Poetics, a mimesis
whose
success
in
imitating
reality
can
be
judged by
the
poignancy of the emotions roused, just as if the auditors were
really Concerned in
it. Both Plato and
Aristotle agree
here.
But in Platons view no rules can be laid down for achieving
that poignancy, for both creation and appreciation come from
outside the
conscious mind.
Plato,
moreover,
sees no
social
justification
for
poetry.
‘‘The
emotions
aroused* ^
retorts
Aristotle, “serve a social end, that of catharsisj*
Such a definition of poetry is insuJB&cient in literature to-day,
not because the Greeks were wrong but because literature, like
society, has changed. If he were systematising literature to-day,
Aristotle would see that the criterion of mimesis was insufficient
to distinguish the existing species of literature, not because of
any weakness in the original definition, but simply because in
the
course
of social
evolution new forms of
literature had
arisen. Mimesis
is characteristic also of the modern novel and
prose play. What we nowadays agree to
call poetry
is some-
thing apart from both play and novel, for which fresh specific
differences must be sought. Our next task is to find them.
But
Aristotle*s

will be devoted to a general historical study of the development
of modern poetry*

THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN POETRY
I
When we use the word ^"modern"^ in a general sense, we use'
it to describe a whole complex of culture which developed in
Europe and spread beyond it from the fifteenth century to the
,
present
day^ There
is something
^^modern'^
in Shakespeare,
Galileo, Michael
Angelo,
Pope,
Goethe and
Voltaire which
we can distinguish from Homer, Thales, Chaucer and Beowulf,
and compare with Valery, Cezanne, James Joyce, Bergson and
Einstein, This complex rests on an economic foundation, The
complex
itself is changeful—no epoch of human history has
been so variegated and dynamic as that from the Elizabethan
age
to
ours*
But
then,
the economic foundations
too have
changed, from feudal to
^
^industrial* L This culture complex
is
the superstructure of the bourgeois revolution in production
a revolution whose nature was
first analysed completely by
Marx in Das KapitaL Modern poetry is capitalist poetry*
It
is
impossible
to understand modern
poetry
unless we
understand it historically—in motion* We can only bring back
dead formulae from a study of poetry as static
^ ‘works of art**,
as something
frozen and
ossified*
This
is
particularly
true
where poetry is the organic product of a whole society violently
in motion*
Yet
to study
the poetry of bourgeois
culture
as
a whole
during
that time
is
a formidable
task. Many nations
and
many languages have been caught up into the bourgeois move-
ment, and yet it is the characteristic of poetry that it demands
for its appreciation a more intimate knowledge of the language
in which it was written than any other form of literature*
But as it happens, England pioneered the bourgeois revolution
in economy* Italy preceded it—^but its* development was stifled
early*
America
outstripped
it—^but
only
at
a
late
date*
In
England
alone the
greater
part of the
bourgeois revolution

unfolded itself, and from there spread to the rest of the globe.
In
France
during
the
period
1789-1871
the
bourgeois
revolution moved
through many
stages
with
grcviter
speed,
greater precision and more relentless logic than here, but
its
very speed made the ideological superstructure more confused.
For a study of bourgeois literary art in general, France during
that short period is more valuable; but for the study of poetry
in
particular; England—where
the revolution unfolded itself
•so much more evenly and in so much more detail—is a better
field.
Owing to
its
earlier and fuller development, the decay of
English bourgeois economy arrived later than in other countries.
Therefore during the period of Imperialism the poetic symp-
toms come to light at
first in other countries than England
in France, Germany and Russia. With the exception, therelore,
of this
concluding
period,
our
historical survey
of modern
poetry will be confined to one country—England.
It
is no accident that this same country, England, has also
been notable for the volume and variety of its contribution
to modern poetry. The fact that England for three centuries
led
the world
in
the development of capitalism and
that,
during the same period,
it led the world in the development
of poetry, are not unrelated coincidences but part of the same
movement of history.
The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part.
The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all
feudal,
patriarchal,
idyllic
relations.
It
has
pitilessly
torn
asunder
the
motley feudal ties that bound man to his “natural superiors,*^ and has left
no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous
“cash payment’*.
The
bourgeoisie
cannot
exist
without
constantly
revolutionising
the
means of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them
the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production
in unaltered form was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all
earlier
industrial
classes. Constant revolutionising of production*
uninter-
rupted
disturbance of
all
social
conditions,
everlasting
uncertainty and
agitation
distinguish the bourgeois epoch from
all
earlier ones.
All
fixed
fast-frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and
opinions,
are swept away,
all new-formed ones become antiquated before
they can ossify. AU that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned,

and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of
life and his relations with his kind.^
Capitalist poetry reflects these conditions. It is the outcome
of these conditions. The birth of poetry took place from the
undifferentiated matrix of the
tribe, which gave
it a myth-
ological character.
It separated itself from religion as the art
of a ruling class in class society, but, except in moments of
revolutionary
transition
like
that
of
fourth
century
B.c.
Greece,
this art led a quiet existence, mirroring the slow rise
and slow collapse of a class “whose first condition of existence
is conservation of its mode of production in unaltered form”.
Then a class developed beneath the quiet, stiff art of feudalism,
whose vigour is first announced by the Gothic cathedrals. This
class in turn became a ruling class, but one whose condition of
existence
is a constant revolution of the means of production,
and thereby the relations of production, and with them the
whole relations of society.
Its art
is therefore in its essence an insurgent, non-formal,
naturalistic
art. Only the art of revolutionary Greece in any
way
forecasts
the
naturalism of bourgeois
art.
It
is an
art
which constantly revolutionises
its own conventions,
just as
bourgeois economy
constantly
revolutionises
its own means
of production. This constant revolution,
this constant sweep-
ing-away of “ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions”,
this
“everlasting
uncertainty
and
agitation”,
distinguishes
bourgeois art from all previous art. Any bourgeois artist who
even for a generation rests upon die conventions of his time
becomes “academic” and his art lifeless. This same movement
is characteristic of English poetry.
The characteristic of capitalist economy is that it apparently
sweeps away
all
directly
coercive
relations between men—
and seems to substitute for them the coercive relations of men
to a thing—the State-upheld right to property. Men are no
longer
coercively tied together,
as in a feudal society serf is
tied to lord and lord to overlord, but they produce independ-
ently for the
free market, and buy independendy from
this
free market. They take
not merely their products but

in
58
ILLUSION AND REALITY
their abilities to the market and are entitled to sell their labour-
power there without let or hindrance
to
the highest bidder.
This unreserved access to an unrestricted market
constitutes
the “freedom” of capitalist society.
Thus there appear to be no coercive relations between men,
but
only
force-upheld
relations
between men
and
a
thing
(property) which result in relations between an individual and
the market. The market seems to be a part of Nature, a piece
of the environment, subject to natural “laws” of supply and
demand. Its coercion does not seem the coercion of men, but
of blind natural forces, like a gale or volcanic eruption.
In fact the market
is nothing but the blind expression of
real
relations between men. These
relations are
relations of
coercion,
the
characteristic
exploitation
of
capitalism
by
ownership of the means of production and the purchase of the
labour-power of the free labourer—free of all property but his
bare
hands.
But
just because
it
is a
blind
expression,
it
is
coercive and anarchic, and acts with the violence and uncon-
trolled recklessness of a natural force. Just because the coercive
relations between capitalist and wage-labourer are veiled, they
are so much the more brutal and shameless.
Capitalist economy,
therefore,
is
the economy of a sham
individualism and a hollow freedom
for the
majority. The
condition of existence of the bourgeois class as a ruling class,
and therefore the condition of its freedom in society,
is the
absence of directly coercive relations between man and man.
Such
coercive
relations
are
restrictions—^like
the
feudal
restrictions which bind serf to lord. But freedom without social
relations would be no freedom at all, but only a blind anarchy
in which society must perish. In addition,
therefore,
to the
absence
of direct
relations between men,
bourgeois
society
must include the presence of rights to absolute ownership of
means of production—the right of “private property”. This
absolute right is maintained by the device of a coercive State
power, with
its laws and police and army, which, because
it
enforces a property right and not any direct ownership of men
by men, seems to tower over society as something mediating
and independent. But in fact, since this property right gives
the bourgeois coercive power over the “free” labourer through

Ill
DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN POETRY
59
ownership of the means of production, both the State and the
bourgeois economy
it enforces veil a coercive society for the
majority, and the only freedom it contains is the freedom of the
bourgeois from nature—due to his monopolisation of the social
product—and his freedom from human coercion—due to the
elimination from society of
all
directly coercive relations of
a feudal character. Seen from the viewpoint of the bourgeois,
bourgeois society is a free society whose freedom
is due to its
individualism,
to
its completely free market and
its absence
of direct social relations, of which absence the free market is
the cause and expression. But to the rest of society bourgeois
society
is
a
coercive
society whose
individualism and
free
market is the method of coercion* This is the basic contradic-
tion of bourgeois society, which must be grasped to understand
the
whole
movement
which
secures
the
development
of
capitalist culture.
We saw in our
analysis of the birth of poetry
that
early
poetry
is
essentially
collective emotion,
and
is born
in the
group festival. It is not collective emotion of an unconditioned,
"
instinctive kind, such as might be roused in a herd by a foe;
it
is the collective emotion of a response conditioned by the
needs of economic association.
Now bourgeois
culture
is the culture of a
class
to whom
freedom—man^s
realisation
of
all
his
instinctive powers—^is
secured by
* "individualism* \
It might
therefore seem
that
bourgeois
civilisation should be
anti-poetic,
because
poetry
is collective and the bourgeois is an individualist.
But this is to take the bourgeois at his own valuation. Certainly
we must
first of all do
this, whether to understand him
as
capitalist or as poet. The bourgeois sees himself as an heroic
figure fighting a lone fight for freedom—as the individualist
battling against all the social relations which fetter the natural
man, who
is born free and
is for some strange reason every-
where in chains. And in fact his individualism does lead to a
.continual
technical
advance
and
therefore
to an
increasing
freedom. His
fight against
feudal
social
relations
permits
a
great
release
of the
productive
forces
of
society.
His
in-
dividualism expresses the particular way in which the bourge
is
economy
continually
revolutionises
the
base
on
which
it

in
6o
illusion and reality
stands, until the base becomes too much for the superstructure,
and bourgeois economy explodes into
its opposite.
And,
in the same way,
the bourgeois poet sees himself as
an
individualist
striving
to
realise what
is
most
essentially
himself by an expansive outward movement of the energy of
his heart, by a release of internal forces which outward forms
are crippling. This
is the bourgeois dream,
the dream of the
one man alone producing the phenomena of the world. He
is
Faust, Hamlet, Robinson Crusoe, Satan and Prufrock.
This
^'individualism"" of the
bourgeois, which
is born of
the need to dissolve the restrictions of feudal society, causes a
tremendous and ceaseless technical advance in production. In
the same way
it causes in poetry a tremendous and
ceaseless
advance in technique.
But both
capitalist and
poet become
darker
figures—first
tragic, then pitiful and finally vicious. The capitalist finds his
very individualism, his very freedom, producing all the blind
coercion of war, anarchy, sltmip and revolution. The machine
in
its productiveness finally threatens even him. The market
in its blindness becomes a terrifying force of nature.
By means of the market,
capitalist constantly hurls down
fellow capitalist into wage-labour or relegates him to die ranks
of the temporarily privileged "salariat"". The artisan of yester-
day is the factory hand of to-day. The shop-owner, of this year
is die chain-store manager of the next year* Last week, owner
of a small business—to-day, salaried executive in a large trust:
this
is the dramatic process whereby capitalism revolutionises
itself. It does so by means of the very free market on which
the
bourgeois
depends
for
freedom.
This
guarantee
of
in-
dividualism and independence produces
the very
opposite
trustification and dependence on finance capital. This golden
garden of fair competition produces the very opposite of fair-
ness:
price-cutting,
wars,
cartels,
monopolies,
'corners"" and
vertical trusts. But all these evils seem to the bourgeois, who
is hurled from his freedom by them, to be—as indeed diey are
—direct and
coercive
social
relations and he
revolts
against
them as the very opposite of his ideal recipe, the free market.
'He
therefore
revolts
against them
by demanding
a
fairer
market and keener competition, without realising that since

m
DEVELOPMENT OF 3S40DERN POETRY
6l
these
ills
are
created by
the
free
market,
to demand
the
intensification of its freedom is to demand an intensification of
the slavery he hates. He therefore drives on the movement he
detests, and can only escape by escaping from the bourgeois
contradiction. The bourgeois
is always talking about liberty
because it is always slipping from his grasp.
The
bourgeois
poet
treads
a
similar
circle. He
finds
the
loneliness which is the condition of his freedom unendurable
and coercive. He finds more and more of his experience of the
earth
and
the
universe
unfriendly and
a
restraint on
his
freedom. He ejects everything soci^ from his soul, and finds
that it deflates, leaving him petty, empty and insecure.
How has this come about? We can only discover why if we
now cease to take the bourgeois at his own valuation, and lay
bare the economic motion of which his own valuation of him-
self is the reflection. At each stage the bourgeois finds that his^
abolition of social ^Restrictions** leads to their intensification*
His drive towards a free market exposes the producer to a gale
of competition of which the only outcome is—an amalgama-
tion. His
destruction of feudal
'Complexities**
in favour
^ of
the simple bourgeois right to property produces all the staggering
elaboration of the bourgeois law of contract. His hate of feudal
rule and
social
coercion
produces
the
strongly-centralised,
bourgeois State with
its endless petty interferences with the
liberty of the
individual.
Individualism has produced
anti-
individualism. The very economy whose mission it seemed to
be to sweep away all social relations, produces a society more
overwhelmingly
complex
than
any
hitherto
known.
His
demand for freedom is a negation of freedom. He is a
mirror-
revolutionary** and continually revolutionises society by asking
for that which will procure the opposite of what he desires.
This
self-contradictory movement
is
given
in
the funda-
mental law of capitalist production. It is a result of the same
law which brings about a price-cutting war,
in which each
capitalist is compelled to ruin the other, and cannot do other-
wise, for to delay the final ruin of all would ensure his earlier
extinction. This moyement produces the continual increa.se of
constant capital in every industty, which leads to a falling rate
of interest and causes the familiar capitalist crisis, from which

6z
III
ILLUSION AND REALITY
recovery is only possible by means of the destruction of a large
portion
of
the
country's
wealth.
This
same
contradiction
produces also the expansive growth of capitalism,
its constant
revolution of its own basis and
its eager pressure into eveiy
corner of the world. It produces a continual amalgamation and
trustification which, by increasing the proportion of constant
capital, only accelerates the falling rate of profit.
This
contradiction in
capitalist production, which
secuies
its revolutionary expansion, also brings about its revolutiona^
decline. When the expansive powers of capitalism have
laid
the whole world under tribute, the rival centres of advance cl^h
against each other in concealed or open war, only to intensify
in each other the causes which demand expansion. The pro-
ductive forces
strain at the productive
relations. There
is
a
final
crisis of
^ ^over-production* ^ The
falling
rate of profit,
unavoidable
fruit of the
self-contradiction
in
the
heart
of
capitalism, becomes apparent in mass unemployment, a world
crisis,
a
general slowing-down
of
capitalist
expansion,
war
and revolution. And this final movement, in which the bour-
geois
finds
his
charter of freedom the very bond chat
seals
him slave to necessity,
is reflected also in his poetry, in the
poetry of Imperialism and Fascism.
The
very destruction of
all
direct
social
coercion—^which
was
the
condition of bourgeois pre-eminence and
therefore
freedom—is
the condition of slavery
for the
exploited
and
expropriated,
because
it
is
the
means
of maintaining
the
indirect
coercion of
capital,
and
for
this
uses
the
openly
coercive machinery of the State. Therefore in the latter part
of
capitalist development,
the
bourgeois
finds himself con-
fronted by a class, the means of whose freedom is an organisa-
tion into trade unions, which alleviate the rigour of, the free
market.
These
can
only
secure freedom
for
themselves by
imposing coercive restrictions on him. This class
is the
class
of wage-labourers or proletarians. Organising themselves
first
as
Chartists,
then in the trade unions, and
finally
led
by^ a
conscious
political
party,
they
impose
on
the
capitalist
coercive restrictions, such as the Factory Acts, social insurance
and the> like, which are the conditions of such liberty as they
can obtain within the categories of bourgeois economy. But

Ill
DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN POETRY
63
each class's ^freedom secures the unfreedom of the other—that
is the contradiction which now comes nakedly to light*
Bourgeois production imposes on
this
class
the means
of
organisation* Bourgeois economy groups its members in towns
and
factories
and makes them work
in
co-operation* The
bourgeois class temporarily buried the competition of men and
appealed
to
the
brotherhood
of men whenever
it
required
their
alliance
to overthrow
feudal
restrictions; and
this gave
the wage-labourers a political education and led to the forma-
tion of their political party*
This new class finally secures its own freedom by a complete
executive
organisation of itself as a
ruling
class—the Soviets
of workers' power—and imposes on the bourgeoisie the
final
"Treedom"
of release from
ownership
of
private
property,
thus exposing the lie on which the bourgeois notion of freedom
was based* But with the disappearance of the bourgeoisie the
last
coercive
relation rooted
in
the
necessities
of economic
production
disappears,
and man
can
set
about
becoming
genuinely free*
This proletarian revolution is accomplished in circumstances
which
necessarily uproot and
proletariamse numbers of the
bourgeoisie themselves*
^‘Just
as
therefore,
at an
earlier
period,
a
section of the
nobility went over to the bourgeoi§ie, so now a portion of the
bourgeoisie
goes over to
the
proletariat, and
in particular
a
portion of the bourgeois ideologists who have raised themselves
to
the
level
of comprehending
theoretically
the
historical
movement as a whole* They thus defend not their present, but
their
future
interests;
they
desert
their own standpoint
to
place themselves at that of the proletariat*" ^
This desertion of the bourgeois ideologists to defend their
future
interests,
in the
final movement of capitalism,
is
also
reflected in English poetry*
We cannot therefore understand the fundamental movement
of capitalist poetry unless we understand that the self-contra-
diction which drives on the development of bourgeois poetry
so rapidly and restlessly
is the ideological counterpart of the
self-contradiction which
produces
the
increasing movement
1 The Communist Manifesto*

64
of capitalist economy and is the cause of the growth of constant
capital,
the falling rate of profit, and the recurrent capitalist
crisis* What
the bourgeois encounters in
real life necessarily
moulds his ideal experience* The collective world of art is fed
by the
collective world of real society because
it
is built of
materials which derive their structure and emotional associa-
tions from social use*
z
To
the
bourgeois, freedom
is
not
the
consciousness
of
necessity but the ignorance of it* He stands society on its head.
To him the instincts are 'Tree’^ and society everywhere puts
them in chains* This
is the reflection, not only of his revolt
against feudal restrictions, but of capitalism's continual revolt
against its own conditions, which at every step drives it forward
to revolutionise
its
base.
The bourgeois is a man who believes in an inborn spontaneity
which secures man^s free will. He does not see
that man
is
only free in so far as he is conscious of the motive of his actions
—as opposed to involuntary actions of a reflex character, like
a
tic, or imposed actions of a coercive character,
like a shove
in the back* To be conscious of the motive is to be conscious
of the cause, that is of the necessity. But the bourgeois protests
against this, because determinism seems to him the antithesis
of free will.
To be conscious of one's motives
is
to will freely—to be
conscious of the necessity of one's actions* Not to be conscious
is to act instinctively like an animal,
or blindly like a man
propelled by a push from behind his back* This consciousness
is not secured by introspection but by a struggle with reality
which
lays
bare
its laws, and secures
to man the means of
consciously using them*
The bourgeois refusal to acknowledge
tliis
is paralleled by
his attitude to society, in which he drinks he
is free
if he
is
free from overt
social
duties—the
restrictions of feudalism.
But at the same time the conditions of capitalist production
demand that he enter into an increasingly complex
series of
relations
with
his
fellow men*
These,
however,
appear
as
relations
to an
objective market controlled by
the
laws of

m
DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN POETRY
65
supply and demand* He
is therefore unconscious of their true
nature and ignorant of the real determinism of society that has
him in its grasp* Because of this he is unfree* He is ruined by
blind
forces; he
is
subject to
crises,
wars,
and slumps and
'*unfair^^
competition*
His
actions
produce
these
things,
although he is undesirous of producing them*
In so far as man understands the laws of outer reality—the
determinism
or
necessity
of dead
nature
as
expressed
by
science—he is free of nature, as is shown by machines* Freedom
here too
is the consciousness of necessity* The bourgeois
is
able to attain to this freedom, which is lacking in earlier class
societies* But this freedom is dependent not on the individual
but on associated men* The more elaborate the machine, the
more
elaborate
the
association needed
to
operate
it* Hence
man cannot be really free of nature without being conscious
of the laws of association in society* And the more the pos-
sibility of being really free develops with the development of
machinery, the more rudely he
is reminded of the slavery of
ignorance*
In
so
far
as man understands
the
nature of society—^the
determinism which connects the consciousness and productive
relations of men—^he can control society's impact upon himself
as an individual and on nature as a social force* But the very
conditions of bourgeois economy demand that social relations
be veiled by the free market and by the forms of commodity
production,
so
that
relations between men
are
disguised
as
relations
to
things* The bourgeois regards any demand that
man should control economic production and become conscious
of determinism as
'"interference with
liberty'"*, And
it
is an
interference with liberty in this respect, that it interferes with
his status as a bourgeois and his privileged position in society
—the
privilege of monopolising
the products and
therefore
the freedom of society*
Thus the root of the bourgeois illusion regarding freedom
and the function of society in relation to the instincts,
is seen
to spring from the essential contradiction of bourgeois economy
—^private
(z*^* individual) property in social means of produc-
tion* The
bourgeois
ceases
to
be
bourgeois
as soon
as he
becomes conscious of the determinism of his social relations,.
E

for consciousness
is not mere contemplation,
it is the product
of an
active
process.
It
is generated by
his experiments
in
controlling social relations, just as his consciousness of Nature’s
determinism
is generated by
his experiments
in
controlling
her. But before men can control
their social
relations,
they
must have the power to do so—that
is, the power of control
tlie means of production on which
social relations
rest. But
how can tliey do this when these means are in the power of a
privileged class?
The condition of freedom for the bourgeois class in a feudal
society
is the non-existence of feudal
rule. The condition of
the freedom of the workers in a capitalist society is the non-
existence
of
capitalist
rule.
This
is
also
the
condition
of
freedom
for
a
completely
free
society—that
is,
a
classless
society. Only in such a society can all men actively develop
their consciousness of social determinism by controlling their
associated
destinies.
The
bourgeois
can
never
accept
this
definition of freedom for all until he has ceased to be a bour-
geois and comprehended the historical movement as a whole.
The nature of this contradiction in the bourgeois notion of
freedom only becomes apparent in so far as bourgeois society
decays,
and
the
freedom
of
the
bourgeois
class
becomes
increasingly antagonistic to the freedom of society as a whole.
The freedom of society
as a whole consists in
its economic
products. These represent the freedom man has won in
his
struggle with Nature. In proportion as these expand, not only
does the bourgeois feel himself free, thanks to the conditions
of bourgeois economy, but the rest of society, which shares
these products,
is not proposed to challenge these
conditions
in a revolutionary way.
It also—^passively—accepts them. All
this seems therefore a confirmation of the bourgeois theory of
freedom. In these particular circumstances the bourgeois theory
of freedom is true. It is an illusion, a phantastic illusion, which
at this stage realises itself in practice. Man
is gaining freedom
by denying
the
relations of
society,
for
these
were
feudal
relations,
already
made
obsolete
by
the
development
of
bourgeois economy in their pores.

existence* The serf, in the period of serfdom, raised himself to
membership
in
the commune,
just
as
the petty
bourgeois,
under the yoke of feudal absolutism, managed to develop into
a bourgeois* The modern labourer, on the contrary, instead of
rising widi the progress of industry, sinks deeper and deeper
below the conditions of existence of his own class* He becomes
a pauper, and pauperism develops more rapidly than population
and wealth* And here it becomes evident that the bourgeoisie
is
unfit any longer to be the ruling

society and
to
impose
its

riding law* It is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure
an existence to its slave within his slavery, because it cannot
help letting him sink into such a state, that it has to feed him
instead of being fed by him* Society can no longer live under
this
bourgeoisie:
in
other words,
its
existence
is no
longer
compatible with society*^'
1
At
this
point,
' therefore,
the
contradictory
nature of
, the
bourgeois
definition
of freedom
discloses
itself because
the
advance of society has objectively negated
it* This,* therefore,
gives way
to
a
definition of freedom
as a
consciousness of
determinism, and the condition of man's freedom is now 'seen
to be the consciousness and the control of the determining
causes of social
relations—the productive
forces* But
this
is
a
revolutionary demand—
demand
for
socialism and
pro-
letarian power,
and
it
is opposed by
the
bourgeois
as
the
negation of freedom—as indeed
it
is for him,
as a bourgeois*
He attempts to speak here in the name of all society, but the
revolutionary movement of the bulk of society
itself denies
him
this
right*
Thus
the
bourgeois
illusion
regarding
freedom,
which
counterposes freedom and individualism to determinism and
society,
overlooks
the
fact
that
society
is
the
instrument
whereby man,
the unfree
individual,
in
association
realises
his freedom and that the conditions of such association are
the conditions of freedom* This illusion
is itself the product
of
a
particular
class-society, and
a
reflection of the
special
privilege
on
which
bourgeois
rule
rests,
and which
rends
society in two as long as it persists*

ILLUSION AND RRALITY
Other class societies have their own illusions. Thus a slave-
owning society sees freedom,
nor
in the absence of coercive
relations, but in a special coercive relation,
that of Will,
in
which the lord directs, and the slave blindly obeys as of right.
In such a society,
to be free
is to will. But the development
of classes sunders the consciousness that directs the will from
the reality with which the slave, who blindly obe}’s the will,
must
actively
struggle. The economic
decline which
results
from this is a reflection of unfreedom due to man's increasing
unconsciousness of necessity, due to the increasing inactivity
of the class which is supposed to be the vehicle of consciousness
and therefore of freedom. Consciousness is generated by man’s
active struggle with Nature, and perishes in a blind formalism
once that grapple
ceases.
To be aware of the true nature of freedom— that it involves
consciousness of the determinism of the environment and of
man and of the society which expres.ses
their mutual .struggle
—to be aware of this, not as a result of contemplation, which
cannot generate consciousness, but in active struggle,
is to be
engaged
in a
struggle
to end
those
very
relations
of blind
coercion or exploitation in society which obstruct the develop-
ment of this consciousness. To end them is to end cksses and
give men the means of becoming truly free: but this can only
happen because capitalism has evolved
its own grave-digger
the
class whose conditions of existence nor only drive
it
to
' revolt and make possible a successful rule, but also ensure that
its rule can only be based on an extinction of all rights which
can produce classes,

The ^adual self-exposure of
thi.s
illttsion
is the history of
bourgeois freedom. We may find
it as tragic
as Macbeth,
as
comic as Falstaff,
as inspiring as
Henry V, or
as disgusting
as the world of Timon of Athens—all these aspects are reflected
in
its
development, corresponding to
a similar development
in the economic foundations.
Have we
not
said
that
tragedy
is
always
a
problem
of
necessity? To Oedipus tragedy appears in the very guise by
which freedom seems to be secured in a slave-owning society

—as Will,
as Fate visualised in the form of a divine, superior
will overriding all human wills* 1 To Macbeth tragedy appears
in
the
cloak
of bourgeois
freedom:
man's
free
desires

temperately
issuing
forth
are
reflected
back upon him by
circumstances and now appear
as
their opposite—Macbeth's
wishes, granted by the three Witches, reappear as those wishes
inverted,
as
a
contradiction
of
their
very
essence*
Birnam
Wood comes

All bourgeois poetry
is an expression of the movement of
the bourgeois
illusion,
according
as the contradiction rooted
in bourgeois economy emerges
in the course of the develop-
ment of capitalism* Men are not blindly moulded by economy;
economy
is
the
result
of
their
actions,
and
its movement
reflects the nature of men* Poetry is then an expression of the
real essence of associated men and derives its truth from this*
The bourgeois
illusion
is then seen to be a phantasy and
bears the same relation to truth as the phantasy of primitive
mythology* In the collective festival, where poetry is born, the
phantastic world of poetry anticipates the harvest and, by so
doing, makes possible the real harvest* But the illusion of this
collective phantasy is not a mere drab copy of the harvest yet
to be:
it
is a reflection of the emotional complex involved in
the fact that man must stand in a certain relation to others
and
to the harvest,
that his
instincts must be adapted in a
certain way to Nature and other men,
to make the harvest
possible* The collective poetry or the
festival, although
it
is
a confused perception of the real harvest-to-be,
is an accurate
picture of the
instinctive
adaptations involved in associated
man's relation to the harvest process*
It
is a real picture of
man's heart*
In the same way bourgeois poetry reflects, in all its variety
and
complexity,
the
instinctive adaptations of men
to
each
other and Nature necessary in those social relations which will
produce freedom—for freedom,
as we saw,
is merely's man's
phantastic and poetic expression for the economic product of
society which secures his self-realisation* We include of course

in this economic product not merely the commercial or sale-
able
product
of
society,
but
the
cultural
and
emotional
products, including men’s consciousnesses themselves. Hence
this bourgeois illusion regarding freedom, of which bourgeois
poetry is the expression, has a reality in so far as it produces, by
its existence, freedom—I do not mean in any formal sense,
I
mean that just as primitive poetry is justified by the material
harvest
it produces, which
is
the means of the
primitive’s
freedom,
so
bourgeois
poetry
is
justified
by
the
material
product of the society which generates it in its movement. But
it
is a freedom not of all society, but of die bourgeois class
which appropriates the major part of society’s products.
For freedom
is not a
state,
it
is a
specific struggle with
Nature. Freedom
is always
relative,
relative
to
the
success
of the struggle. The consciousness of the nature of freedom
is
not the simple contemplation of a metaphysical problem, but
the very act of living and behaving like a man in a certain
state of society. Each stage of consciousness is definitely won;
it is only maintained as a living thing by social movement
the movement we call labour. The working-out of the bour-
geois illusion concerning freedom,
first as a triumphant truth
(the growth and increasing prosperity of capitalism), next as
a gradually revealed lie (the decline and final crisis of capital-
ism) and finally as its passage’ into its opposite, freedom as the
life-won
consciousness
of
social
necessity
(the
proletarian
revolution), is a colossal movement of men, materials, emotions
and ideas,
it
is a whole history of toiling, learning, suffering
and hoping men.
Because of the
scale,
energy and
material
complexity of the movement, bourgeois poetry is the glittering,
subtle, complex, many-sided thing it is. The bourgeois illusion
which
is also the condition of freedom for the bourgeoisie
is
realised in their own poetry, because bourgeois poets,
like the
rest of the
bourgeoisie,
realise
it
in
their
lives,
in
all
its
triumphant emotion,
its tragedy,
its power of analysis and its
spiritual
disgust. And
the
consciousness
of
socidi
necessity
which is the condition of freedom for the people as a whole in
classless,
communist
society,
will be
realised in communist
poetry because
it can only be realised in its essence, not as a
metaphysical formula, but by living as men in a developing

The bourgeois
sees man^s instincts—^his
^
'heart'^ source of
his
desires and aims—as the source of his freedom* This
is
false inasmuch as the instincts unadapted are blind and unfree*
But when adapted by the relations of society they give rise to
emotions, and these adaptations,
of which the emotions
are
the
expression and mirror,
are
the means whereby
the
in-
stinctive energy of man
is diverted to drive the machine of
society: the machine of society, revolving, enables man to face
Nature and
struggle with her,
not
as individual, instinctive
man but as associated, adapted men* Thus the instincts drive
on the movement which secures man's freedom* This illusion
and this truth about the relation of the instincts to freedom and
society work themselves out in bourgeois poetry and constitute
its secret energy and constant life* Thus, knowing the essence
of this bourgeois
illusion
to
be a special
belief concerning
"individualism" or the "natural man", which in turn derives
from
the
conditions
of bourgeois
economy, we
cannot be
surprised
that
the
bourgeois
poet
is
the
lonely man who,
apparently turning away from society into himself, by so doing
expresses
the more
strongly
the
essential
relations
of con-
temporary society* Bourgeois poetry
is individualistic because
it expresses the collective emotion of its era.
We saw
that
all
literary
art—originally
generated by
the
passage of mythology into
religion,
so that poetry separated
itself from
mythology—^is
rooted
in
freedom,
and
is
the
expression of the spontaneity of society, which in turn is based
on the material products of society and is a kind of mould of
the
emotional
relations
these
material
products demand of
associated man*
It
is because art is the expression of freedom
that,' in a developed class-society,
art
is an expression of the
illusion, not of all society but only of the ruling class* In the
course of the development of the bourgeois
illusion,
literary
art in turn separates the story from poetry* Poetry, younger,
more
primitive,
more
emotionally
direct,
is
therefore
in
capitalist
culture concerned with the emotions struck from

72
the
instincts—like
sparks
from
flint—in
the
conditioning
of instinctive responses by the relations of society. It expresses
that part of the bourgeois illusion which sees the heart and the
feelings of the individual man as the source of freedom,
life
and
reality,
because the freedom of society
as
a whole
rests
ultimately on the drive of those instincts whose struggle with
Nature has created society. Because
it must use the collective
world of language it focuses all the emotional life of society in
one giant 'T' which
is common to
all, and gives to all men
one breathless experience.
The story takes the reverse of the
tapestry, and
expresses
the
instincts
as
they emerge
in
society
in one adapted
in-
dividual. In
this case the individualism of bourgeois
society
is expressed as an interest in men not as abstracted into one
common experience, but as characters^ as social types living in
a real world.
We
shall
understand
the
way
in
which
the
bourgeois
illusion gives rise to poetry, how this self-contradiction works
itself out
in
actual
poems, when we have
studied
(a)
the
development of English poetry in the persons of representative
poets,
schools and trends,
(b) the technique of poetiy,
(c)
its
relation to language as a whole,
(d) the nature of the impact
of the poet's
life on his environipent, and
(e) the particular
way in which this impact gives rise to poems.

IV
ENGLISH POETS
(I. The Period of Primitive Accumulation)
I
Capitalism requires two conditions for its existence—masses
of
capital
and
^Tree^^
i.e.
expropriated—^wage,
labourers^
Once the movement has started,
capitalism generates
its own
conditions
for
further
development* The sum
of constant
capital grows by accumulation and aggregates by amalgamation,
and this amalgamation, by continually expropriating
artisans
and other petty bourgeoisie, produces the necessary supply of
wage-labourers*
A period of primitive accumulation
is
therefore
necessary
before
these
conditions
can
be
realised*
This
primitive
accumulation must necessarily be violent and forcible, for the
bourgeoisie,
not yet a ruling
class,
has not yet
created
the
political
conditions
for
its own
expansion:
the State
is
not
yet a bourgeois state*
In
England
during
this
period
the
bourgeoisie
and
that
section of the nobility which had gone over to the bourgeoisie,
seized the Church lands and treasure and created a horde of
dispossessed vagfants by the enclosure of common lands, the
closing of the
monasteries,
the
extension of sheep-farming,
and the final extinction of the feudal lords with their retainers*
The
seizure of gold and
silver from the New World
also
played an important part in providing a base for capitalism*
This movement was
possible because
the monarchy,
in
its
fight with the
feudal
nobility,
leant on the bourgeois
class
and
in
turn rewarded them
for
their
support* The Tudor
monarchs were autocrats in alliance with the bourgeoisie and
bourgeoisified nobility*
In this period of primitive accumulation the conditions fot

74
ILLUSION AND REALITY
IV
the growth of the bourgeois
class
are
created
lawlessly* To
every bourgeois
it seems as if his instincts—his “freedom*"
are
intolerably
restricted by laws*
rights and
restraints* and
that
beauty and
life
can
only be
obtained
by
the
violent
expansion of his desires.
Intemperate
will,
“bloody,
bold and
resolute*",
without
norm or measure, is the spirit of this era of primitive accumula-
tion. The
absolute-individual
will overriding
all other
wills
is
therefore
the
principle
of
life
for
the
Elizabethan
age.
Marlowe*s Faust and Tamburlaine express this principle in its
naivest form.
This
life-principle reaches
its highest embodiment in
the
Renaissance
“prince**.
In
Italy and
England—at
this
time
leaders
in
primitive
accumulation—life
reaches
its
most
poignant issue in the absolute will of the prince—this figure
of the prince
expresses most
clearly
the
bourgeois
illusion,
just
as
in
real
society the prince
is the necessary means of
realising the conditions for bourgeois expansion. To break the
moulds of feudalism and wrench from them capital requires
the strength and remorselessness of an absolute monarch. Any
established bound or let to the divine right of his will would
be
wrong,
for
such bounds
or
lets,
being
established and
traditional,
could only be
feudal, and would therefore hold
back the development of the bourgeois class.
Elizabethan poetry
in
all
its
grandeur and
insurgence
is
the
voice
of this
princely
will,
the
absolute bourgeois
will
whose very virtue consists in breaking all current conventions
and realising
itself. That
is why
all Shakespeare*s heroes are
princely; why kingliness is the ideal type of human behaviour
at this time.
Marlowe,
Chapman,
Greene,
but
above
all
ShakewSpeare,
born of bourgeois parents,
exactly
express the cyclonic force
of the princely bourgeois will in this era, in all its vigour and
recklessness.
Lear,
Hamlet,
Macbeth,
Antony,
Troilus,
Othello, Romeo and
Coriolanus,
each
in
his
different way
knows no other obligation than to be the thing he is, to realise
himself to the last drop,
to give out in its purest and most
exquisite form the aroma of self. The age of chivalry appears,
not
as
it
sees
itself,
but
discredited
and
insulted,
as
the

IV
ENGLISH POETS
75
bourgeois class sees
it, in the person of Hotspur, Falstaff and
Armado, English cousins of Don Quixote*
Even the meanest creature, the empty, discredited, braggart
Parolles, realises this unbounded self-realisation to be the law
of his stage existence and in some sort the justification of his
character:
Simply to be the thing I am
Shall make me live*
In this intemperate self-expression, by which |:hey seem to
expand and
fill the whole world with their internal phantas-
mogoria,
lies
the
significance of Shakespeare's
heroes. That
even death does not end
their
self-realisation,
that they
are
most essentially themselves in death—Lear, Hamlet, Cleopatra
and Macbeth—in this too is both the secret of their death and
the solution of the tragedy.
The depth with which Shakespeare moved in the bourgeois
illusion, the greatness of his grasp of human society,
is shown
by the fact that he
is ultimately a tragedian. This unfettered
realisation
of human
individualities
involves
for him
the
equally unfettered play of Necessity* The contradiction which
is the driving force of capitalism finds its expression again and
again in Shakespeare's tragedies. In Macheth the hero's ambitions
are realised—^inverted. In King Lear the hero wrecks himself
against the equally untempered expression of his daughters'
will and also against Nature, whose necessity is expressed in a
storm* The power of the storm symbolism lies in the fact that
in a thunderstorm Nature seems to conduct herself, not as an
inexorable machine but like a human being in an ungovernable
passion.
In
Othello man's
love
realises the
best in himself,
yet by the free play of that realisation "kills the thing it loves"*
In Hamlet the problem of a
conflict of unmeasured wills
is
posed in yet another form—^here a man's will is divided against
itself,
and
therefore
even
though
nothing
""external"
can
oppose
or
reflect
it,
it
can yet
struggle with
itself and be
wrecked. This ""doubleness" of a single will is aptly symbolised
by the poisoned swords and goblet in which the one aim is as
it 'were two-faced, and secures opposite ends* In Antony and
Cleopatra and in Romeo and Juliet the fulfilment of the simplest

76
ILLUSION AND REALITY
IV
and most violent instinct is to love without bound or compass,
and
this love ensures the destruction of the
lovers, who
are
justified simply because
the
love
is unbounded, and scorns
patriotism,
fanrily
loyalty,
reason
and
self-interest.
Such
deaths are tragic because at this era the intemperate realisation
of the self is heroic;
it is the life principle of hisroiy. We feel
that
the
death
is
necessary
and
is what must
have
been:
“Nothing is here for tears”.
At this stage the strength and vigour of the bourgeois depends
on
his
cohesion
as
a
class under monarchist
leadership.
In
many
parts
already
a
self-armed,
self-acting commune,
the
bourgeoisie in England, has as
its spear-head the court. The
court is the seat of progress, and its public collective life is for
the moment the source of bourgeois progress and fountain of
primitive accumulation. The court
itself is not bourgeois:
it
seeks the coercive imposition of its will like a feudal overlord,
but it can only do so by allying itself with the bourgeoisie for
whom the “absoluteness” of the monarch, although feudal in
its essence,
is bourgeois in
its outcome because
it
is creating
the conditions for their development.
Hence we find Shakespeare, although expressing the bourgeois
illusion,
is an official of the court or of the bourgeois nobility.
Players are the “Queen’s Servants”. He is not a producer for
the bourgeois market
or
“public”. He
has
a
feudal
status.
Hence
his
art
is not in
its form
individualistic:
it
is
still
collective. It breathes the collective life of the court. As player
and as dramatist he lived with his audience in one simultaneous
public world of emotion. That
is why Elizabethan poetry
is,
in
its
greatest expression, drama—real,
acted drama.
It can
still remain social and public and yet be an expression of the
aspirations of the bourgeois class because of the alliance of the
monarchy with the bourgeoisie.
Elizabethan poetry tells a story. The story always deals with
men’s
individualities
as
realised
in
economic
functions—^it
sees them from the outside as “characters” or “types”. It sites
them in a real social world seen from the outside. But in the
era of primitive accumulation,
bourgeois economy
has
not
differentiated to an extent where social “types” or “norms”
have been
stabilised.
Bourgeois man

establishing an economic role by simply realising his character,
like a splay foot* The instinctive and the economic seem to him
naturally one:
it
is only the feudal roles which seem to him
forced and
*'artificiar\ Hence the
story and poetry
are not
yet antagonistic: they have not yet separated out*
In this era of primitive accumulation all is fluid and homo-
geneous* Bourgeois society has not created its elaborate division
of
labour,
to
which
the
elaborate
complexity
of
culture
corresponds*
To-day psychology,
biology,
logic,
philosophy,
law,
poetry,
history, economics, novel-writing, the
essay,
are
all separate spheres of thought, each requiring specialisation
for their exploration and each using a specialised vocabulary*
But men like Bacon and Galileo and da Vinci did not specialise,
and their language reflects this lack of differentiation* Eliza-
bethan tragedy speaks a language of great range and compass,
from the colloquial to the sublime, from the technical tp the
narrative, because language itself is as yet undifferentiated*
Like all great language, this has been bought and paid for*
Tyndale paid for
it with his
life; the English prose style as
a simple and clear reality,
fit for poetry, was written in the
fear of death, by heretics for whom it was a religious but also
a revolutionary activity demanding a bareness and simplicity
which scorned
all trifling ornament and convention* Nothing
was asked of it but the truth*
These
facts
combined make
it
possible
for
Elizabethan
poetry to be drama and story, collective and undifferentiated,
and yet
express with
extraordinaty power the vigour of the
bourgeois illusion in the era of primitive accumulation*
Shakespeare could not’ have achieved the stature he did
if
he had not exposed,
at the dawn of bourgeois development,
the whole movement of the capitalist contradiction, from its
tremendous achievement
to
its mean
decline*
His
position,
his feudal
* ^perspective**, enabled him to comprehend in one
era all the trends which in later eras were to separate out and
sp
be beyond

only to find this spirit the miserable prisoner of the cash-nexus

its
opposite
and
by
a
unanimous
movement
puritanically
draws its skirt's hem away from the dirt of the court life. The
movement which
at
first was
a
reaction
of the
Reformed
Church against the Catholic Church is now a reaction of the
puritan against the Reformed Church.
The Church,
expressing the absolute
will of the monarch
and
the privileges of the
nobility,
is met by the individual
^‘conscience"
of the
puritan, which knows no law but
the
Spirit—^his own will
idealised.
His
thrift
reflects
the
need,
now that primitive accumulation
is over, to amass the capital
in which freedom and virtue inheres by “saving" and not by
gorgeous and extravagant robbery.
Donne expresses the transition, for he
is torn by
it. At first
captivated by
the
sensuality and
glittering
brilliance of the
court, the insolent treatment he receives produces a movement
away from it, into repentance. The movement is not complete.
In Donne's last years,
filled
as they are with death-thoughts
and magniloquent hatred of
life,
the pride of the
flesh
still
tears at his heart.
Poetry, drawing away from the collective life of the court,
can only withdraw
into the privacy of the bourgeois study,
austerely furnished,
shared only with a few chosen
friends,
surroundings
so
different
from
the
sleeping
and
waking
publicity
of court
life
that
it
rapidly
revolutionises
poetic
technique.
Crashaw,
Herrick,
Herbert,
Vaughan—all
the
poetry of this era seems written by shy, proud men writing
alone
in
their
studies—appealing
from
court
life
to
the
country or to heaven. Language reflects the change. Lyrics no
longer become something that a gentleman could sing to his
lady; conceits are no longer something which could be tossed
in courtly conversation. Poetry
is no longer something
to be
roared out to a mixed audience. It smells of the library where
it was produced. It is a learned man's poetry; student's poetry,
Poe^ is read, not declaimed: it is correspondingly subtle and
intricate.
But Suckling and Lovelace write court poetry, the simple,
open poetry of their class. They stand in antagonism to puritan
poetry, and maintain the traction of the Elizabethan
court
lyric.

The
collective drama, born of the
collective
spirit* of the
court, necessarily perishes. Webster and Tourneur express the
final corruption,
the malignantly
evil and Italiante death of
the first stage of the bourgeois illusion.
3
The
transitional
period moves
towards
Revolution. The
bourgeoisie
revolt
against
the monarchy and
the
privileged
nobility in the name of Parliament, liberty and the
''Spirit^"
which
is
nothing
but
the
bourgeois
will
challenging
the
monarchical. This is the era of armed revolution, of civil war,
and
with
it
emerges
England's
first
openly
revolutionary
poet, Milton.
Revolutionary
in
style,
revolutionary
in
content.
The
bourgeois now
enters
a
stage of the
illusion where he
sees
himself as defiant and lonely, challenging the powers that be.
With this therefore goes an artificial and consciously noble style,
an isolated style, the first of its kind in English poetry*
Bourgeois revolutions, which are only accomplished by the
help of the people as a whole, always reach a stage where it is
felt that they have ^^gone too far*^ The bourgeois demand for
unlimited freedom is all very well until the ''have-nots^' too
demand unlimited freedom, which can only be obtained at the
expense of the ^*haves^\ Then a Cromwell or Robespierre steps
in to hold back coercively the progress of the Revolution.
Such a bourgeois halt must always lead to a reaction, for the
bourgeois class thus destroys its own mass basis.. A Robespierre
gives place to a Directory and then a Napoleon; at an earlier
stage a Cromwell gives place to a Monk and a Charles II. The
wheel does not come back full circle: there is a compromise.
To those who expressed directly the interests of the petty
bourgeois, the puritans, this final stage of reaction is a betrayal
of the Revolution. Therefore in Paradise Lost Milton sees him-
self as Satan overwhelmed and yet
still courageous: damned
and
yet
revolutionary.
In
Paradise
Regained
he
has
already
rejected power
in
this world in exchange
for power in the
next. He scorns
the temples and towers of this world;
his
reward is in the next because he will not compromise^ Hence
F

this poem is defeatist, and lacks the noble defiance of Paradise
Lost In Samson Agonistes Milton recovers his courage* He hopes
for the day when he can pull the temple down on the luxury of
his wanton oppressors and wipe out the Philistine court*
Did
he
consciously
figure
himself
as
Satan,
Jesus
and
Samson? Only consciously perhaps
as Samson* But when he
came
to
tackle
the bourgeois theme of how man,
naturally
good,
is everywhere bad, and to give
the familiar answer
because of Adames
fall from natural goodness
as a result of
temptation—^he was led to consider the tempter, Satan and his
fall* And Satan's struggle being plainly a revolution, he filled
it with
his revolutionary experience and made
tlie defeated
revolutionary
a
puritan,
and
the
reactionary God
a
Stuart*
Thus
emerged
the
towering
figure
of Satan,
which
by
its
unexpected
disproportion
shows
that
Milton's
theme
had
'*mn away with him"*
In Paradise Regained Milton tries to believe that to be defeated
temporally
is
to win
spiritually,
to win "in the long run".
But Milton was a real active revolutionary and in his heart
he finds
this
spiritual satisfaction emptier than real defeat
as the unsatisfactoriness of the poem shows. In Samson Agonistes
he tries to combine defeat and victory.
Of course
the choice was
already made
in
CotnuSf
where
the Lady spurns the luxury of the court and allies herself with
the simple virtue of the people.
Note how
already
the
bourgeois
illusion
is
a
little
self-
conscious.
Milton
is
consciously
noble—Shakespeare
never.
The Elizabethans are heroic: the Puritans are not, and therefore
have to see themselves
as heroic,
in an archaistic dress. The
verse and vocabulary of the Latin secretary to the Provisional
Government
well
expresses
this
second movement
of
the
illusion* The theme of the poems cannot at once be noble and
in any sense contemporary*
Poetry
is
already isolating
itself
from the collective daily
life, which makes
it inevitable that
the prose "story" now begins to appear as an opposite pole.
Of course the transition from the court, like all other move-
ments of the bourgeois illusion, is foreshadowed in Shakespeare*
In The
Tempest Prospero withdraws from corrupt court life to
the peace of his
island study,
like a Herbert or
a Milton*

ENGLISH POETS

83
Shakespeare did the same in life when he retired to^ Stratford-
on-rAvon*
But he could not write there* His magic wand was a collective
one* He had broken it with the breaking of his tie with the
court, and the cloud-cappM palaces of his fancy became ^mpty
air*
4
The atmosphere of a period of reaction such as that which
followed
the
Puritan
Revolution
is
of
good-humoured
cynicism* A betrayal of the extreme
^'ideals"*
for which the
battle had been
fought
appeared prudent
to
the
majority*
Unrestrained
liberty and
the
free
following
of
die
spirit,
excellent in
theory, had in practice been proved
to involve
awkwardnesses for the very class of whom it was the battle-cry*
The bourgeois illusion went through a new stage, that of the
Restoration*
Such a movement is cynical, because it is the outcome of a
betrayal of ''ideals'' for earthly reasons. It is luxurious because
the class with whom the bourgeoisie, having taught it a sharp
lesson, now
allies
itself again—the landed nobility—^has no
need of thrift to acquire capital. It is collective because there
is a return to
the public
court
life and the play*
It
is not
decadent in any
real
sense;
true,
the bourgeoisie has
allied
itself with the old doomed class—^but it has breathed new life
into that class* Webster, expressing the decadence of the court,
gives way to Dryden, expressing its vigour. And Dryden, with
his
turn-coat
life,
so
different
from
Milton's
rectitude,
exactly
expresses
the confused and
rapid movement of the
bourgeoisie of the time, from Cromwell to Charles II and from
James
II
to William
III*
It
is
a
real
alliance—there
is no
question of the feudal regime returning. James II's fate in the
"Glorious
Revdution"
clearly shows
the
bourgeoisie
have
come to rule.
The poet must return from his study to court, but it is now
a more cityfied, sensible,
less romantic and picturesque court.
The
court
itself has become almost burgher. .The language
shows the same passage from study to London
street, from
conscious
heroism
to
business-like
common
sense.
The

84
ILLUSION AND REALITY
IV
sectarian
bourgeois
revolutionary,
a
little
inclined
to
pose,
becomes the sensible man-of-the-world. This is the transition
from
Milton
to
Dryden.
The
idealisation
of compromise
between
rival
classes
as
'"order*^ and
‘hncasure''—a familiar
feature of reaction—leads to the conception of the Augustan
age, which passes by an inevitable transition into eighteenth-
century nationalism, once the Glorious Revolution has shown
that the bourgeoisie ate dominant in the alliance.
The self-valuation of this age as Augustan
is in fact singu-
larly fitting. Caesar played the role of Cromwell, and Augustus
of Charles
II
in
a
similar movement
in Rome,
where
the
knightly class at first rebelled against the senatorial and, when
it became
dangerous
to
go
farther,
entered
on
a
road
of
compromise and reaction.
Elizabethan insurgence, the voice of primitive accumulation,
thus turns into
its opposite, Augustan propriety, the voice of
manufacture. Individualism gives place to good
taste. In
its
early stages bourgeoisdom requires the shattering of all feudal
forms, and therefore its illusion is a realisation of the instincts
in freedom. In the course of this movement,
first to acquire
capital, and then to give capital free play,
it leans
first on the
monarchy—Shakespeare—^and then on the common people
Milton. But because it is the interests of a class it dare not go
too far in its claims, for to advance the interests of all society'
is to deny its own. It must not only shatter the old forms which
maintained the rule of the feudal class,
b^it it must create the
new forms which will ensure its own development as a ruling
class. This
is the epoch of manufacture and of agricultural
capitalism. Land, not factories,
is
still the pivot.
This epoch
is not only opposed
to
that of primitive
ac-
cumulation,
it
is
also opposed to that of free trade.
Capital
exists, but the
proletariat
is
as yet barely in existence* The
ntinpLerous
artisans and
peasants
are
not yet
proletarianised
by the very movement of capital: the State must therefore be
invoked to assist the process. The expansive period of capital-
ism,
in which
the rapid
expropriation
of the
artisan
hurls
thousands
of
« free
labourers on
to
the market,
has not yet
arrived. The vagrants of Elizabethan days have already been
absorbed. The bourgeoisie
finds
that
there
is a
shortage of

IV
ENGLISH POETS
85
wage labour which might lead to a rise in the price of labour-
power over and above its value
(i.e. its cost of reproduction in
food and rent).
Hence there
is need' for a network of laws
to keep down
wages and prices and regulate labour in order to secure
for
the
bourgeois
class
the
conditions
of
its
development.
It
now
sees
the
^^impracticable
idealism^"
of
its
revolutionary
demands
for
liberty.
Order,
measure,
law,
good
taste and
other imposed forms are necessary. Tradition and convention
are valuable. Now
that the feudal State has perished,
these
restraints
ensure the development of bourgeois economy. Free
trade seems the very opposite of desirable to the economists of
this era. The bourgeois illusion betrays itself.
5
Therefore, during the eighteenth century, bourgeois poetry
expresses the spirit of manufacture, of the petty manufacturing
bourgeoisie, beneath the wings of the big landowning capital-
ists,
giving
birth
to
industrial
capitalism. The
shattering
expansion of capitalism has
not yet begun.
Capitalism
still
approximates
to
those economies where ^^conservation
is the
first condition of existence'' and has not yet fully entered into
the state where it
* ^cannot exist without constantly revolution-
ising the means of production". Capitalism
is revolutionising
itself, but like a slowly-growing plant that needs protection,
instead of like an explosion in which the ignition of one part
detonates the rest. By the compromise of the Glorious Revolu-
tion,
the Whig landed-aristocracy were prepared to give that
protection because they had themselves become bourgeoisified.
It was only when the separation between agricultural and
industrial capitalism took place as a result of the rise of the
factory
that
the
cleavage between
the
aristocracy
and
the
bourgeoisie began to have a determining effect on the bourgeois
illusion. While
the woollen-mill was
still no more than
a
hand-loom and an appendage of the
agricultural
capitalist's
sheep-farm there was no direct antagonism between the classes:
it was only as the woollen-mill became a cotton-mill, depending

IV
86
ILLUSION AND REALITY
for
its
raw
material on
outside
sources, and when
sheep-
farming developed in Australia and provided wool for English
mills, that there arose a direct antagonism between agricultural
and industrial capitalism which expressed itself ultimately on
the side of the industrialists as a demand for Free Trade and
the repeal of the Corn Laws*
Pope's
poetry, and
its
''reason '—a reason moving within
singularly simple and shallow categories but moving accurately
—^with its polished language and metre and curt antitheses,
is
a reflection of that stage of the bourgeois illusion where freedom
for
the
bourgeoisie
can
only
be
"limited"—man must
be
prudent in his demands, and yet there is no reason for despair,
all goes well* Life
is on the up-grade, but it is impossible to
hurry* The
imposition
of outward
forms
on
the
heart
is
necessary and accepted. Hence the contrast between the elegant
corset of the eighteenth-century heroic couplet and the natural
luxuriance of Elizabethan blank
verse, whose sprawl almost
conceals the bony structure of the iambic rhythm inside
it.
Pope
perfectly
expresses
the
ideals of the
bourgeois
class
in alliance with a bourgeoisified aristocracy in the epoch of
manufacture.
It is important to note that even now the poet himself has
not been bourgeoisified as a producer* He does not produce as
yet for the free market. Almost a court or aristocratic official
in
the time of Shakespeare,
poet
is a parson's
or
scholar's
occupation in the ensuing period, and even as late as Pope he
is dependent on being patronised,
he has a "patriarchal" or
"idyllic"
relation to the class of whom he
is the spokesman
in the time of Pope.
Such
an
"idyllic"
relation means
that
the
poet
writes
non-idyllic
poetry* He
still
sees himself as
a man playing
a socii
r61e* This was the
case with the primitive poet;
it
remains true of Pope* It imposes on him the obligation to speak
the language of his paymasters or co-poets—in the primitive
tribe
these
constitute
the whole
tribe,
in Augustan
society
these
are the men who form his patron's
circle—the ruling
class*
Johnson—dependent
on
subscribers—bridges
the
gap
between the poet by status and the poet as producer* Thus
poetry remains in this sense collective* It talks a more or less

current language, and the poet writes for an audience he has
directly in mind, to whom perhaps he will presently read his
poems and so .be able to watch their
eflFect. Poetry
is
still for
him not so much a poem—a self-subsisting work of art—as
a movement from
writer
to
reader,
like the movement
of
emotion
in
a
publicly-acted drama
or
the movement
of a
Muse in the minds of men. Hence he realises himself as playing
a social role: inspirer of humanity or redresser of the follies of
mankind. He has not yet become a self-conscious artist.

V
ENGLISH POETS
(IL THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION)
I
The bourgeois illusion now passes to another stage, that of the
Industrial
Revolution,
the
''explosive*'
stage
of
capitalism*
Now the growth of capitalism transforms all idyllic patriarchal
relations—including
that
of
the
poet
to
the
class
whose
aspirations he voices—^into "callous" casivnexus*
Of course this does not make the poet regard himself as a
shopkeeper and his poems as cheeses. To suppose this is to over-
look the compensatory and dynamic nature of the connection
between illusion and reality. In fact it has the opposite effect.
It has the effect of making the poet increasingly regard himself
as a man removed from society, as an individualist realising only
the
instincts
of
his
heart and
not
responsible
to
society's
demands—whether expressed in the duties of a citizen, a fearer
of God or a faithful servant of Mammon. At the same time his
poems come increasingly to seem worthy ends-in-themselves.
This
is the final explosive movement of the bourgeois con-
tradiction. The
bourgeois
illusion
has
already swayed from
antithesis to antithesis, but as a result of this last final move-
ment it can only pass, like a whirling piece of metal thrown off
by an exploding flywheel, out of the orbit of the bourgeois
categories of thought altogether.
As a result of the compromise of the eighteenth century,
beneath the network of safeguards and protections which was
characteristic of the
era of manufacture,
bourgeois economy
developed to the stage where by the use of the machine, the
steam-engine and
the power-loom
it
acquired an enormous
power
of
self-expansion.
At
the same
time
the
"factory"
broke away from
the farm of which
it was
the handicraft
adjunct and challenged it as a mightier and opposed force.

V
ENGLISH POETS
89
On the one hand organised Jabour inside the factory pro-
gressively increased, on the other hand the individual anarchy
of the external market also increased* On the one hand there
was an
incr-easingly public form of production, on the other
hand an increasingly private form of appropriation* At the one
pole was an increasingly landless and toolless proletariat, at the
other an increasingly wealthy bourgeoisie* This self-contradic-
tion in capitalist economy provided the terrific momentum of
the Industrial Revolution*
The
bourgeoisie, who had
found
its own
revolutionary-
puritan ideals of liberty *'extreme*\ and returned to the com-
promise of mercantilist good taste that seemed eternal reason,
now again found its heart had been right, and reason wrong*
This
revealed
itself
first of all
as
a
cleavage between the
former
landed-aristocracy and the industrial bourgeoisie,
ex-
pressing the rise of the factory to predominance over the farm*
The landed aristocracy, and the restrictions it demanded for its
growth,
was now
confronted by
industrial
capital and
its
demands*
Capital had found an inexhaustible self-expansive
power in machinery and outside sources of raw material* So far
from any of the earlier forms being of value to
it, they were
so many restraints* The cost of labour-power could safely be
left to fall to its real value, for the machine by its competition
creates the proletariat it requires to serve it* The real value of
labour-power in turn depends on the real value of wheat, which
is
less
in the colonies and America than in England because
there it embodies less socially-necessary labour* The Corn Laws,
which safeguard the agricultural
capitalist,
therefore hamper
the industrialist* Their interests—^reconciled during the period
of wage-labour shortage—are now opposed* All the forms and
restraints
that oppose
this
free
expansion of the
industrial
bourgeoisie must be shattered* To accomplish this shattering,
the bourgeoisie called to its standard all other classes, precisely
as in the time of the Puritan Revolution* It claimed to speak
for the people as against the oppressors* It demanded Reform
and the Repeal of the Corn Laws*
It attacked the Church,
either as Puritan (Methodist) or as open sceptic* It attacked all
laws as restrictive of equality* It advanced the conception of the
naturally good man, born free but everywhere in chains* Such

ILLUSION AND REALITY
V
90
revolts
against
existing systems
of laws^
canons,
forms and
traditions always appear as a revolt of the heart against reason,
a revolt of feeling and the sentiments against sterile formalism
and the tyranny of the past. Marlowe, Shelley, Lawrence and
Dali have a certain parallelism here; each expresses this revolt
in a manner appropriate to the period.
We cannot understand this final movement of poetry unless
we understand that at every step the bourgeois is revolutionary
in that he is revolutionising his own basis. But he revolutionises
it only to make it consistently more bourgeois. In the same way
each important bourgeois poet is revolutionary, but he expresses
the very movement which brings more violently into the open
the contradiction against which his revolutionary poetry
is a
protest. They are ^'mirror revolutionaries' ^ They attempt to
reach an object in a mirror, only to move farther away from the
real
object. And what can
that object be but the common
object of man as producer and
as poet—freedom? The poig-
nancy of their tragedy and pessimism derives its bite from this
perpetual recession of the desired
object
as they advance
to
grasp
it. ^Ta Belle Dame Sans Merci" has them all in
thrall.
They wake up on the cold hillside.
2
Blake,
Byron,
Keats, Wordsworth and Shelley express
this
ideological
revolution,
each
in
their
different
ways,
as
a
Romantic Revolution.
Byron is an aristocrat—^but he is one who is conscious of die
break-up of his
class
as a force, and the necessity to go oyer
to
the
bourgeoisie.
Hence
his
mixture
of
cynicism
and
romanticism.
These deserters are in moments of revolution always useful
and always dangerous allies. Too often their desertion of their
class and their attachment to another,
is not so much a **com-
prehension of the historical movement as a whole" as a revolt
against the cramping circumstances imposed on them by their
own class's dissolution, and in a mood of egoistic anarchy they
seize upon the aspirations of the other
class as a weapon in

V
ENGLISH POETS
91
their private battle* They are always individualistic, romantic
figures with
a
strong element of the poseur. They
will
the
destruction of their own class but not the rise of the other, and
this
rise, when
it becomes
evident and demands
that
they,
change their merely destructive enmity to the dying class to a
constructive loyalty to the new, may, in act if not in word,
throw them back into the arms of the enemy* They become
counter-revolutionaries* Danton and Trotsky are examples of
this type*
Byron^s death at Missolonghi occurred before any
such complete development, but
it is significant that he was
prepared to fight for liberty in Greece rather than England* In
him the revolt of the heart against the reason appears
as the
revolt
of
the
hero
against
circumstances,
against
morals,
against all **pettiness^* and convention* This Byronism is very
symptomatic, and it is also symptomatic that in Byron it goes
with a complete selfishness and carelessness for the sensibilities
of others* Milton's Satan has taken on a new guise, one far
less' noble, petulant even*
Byron is most successful as a mocker—as a Don Juan* On the
one hand to be cynical, to mock at the farce of human exist-
ence, on the other hand to be sentimental, and complain of the
way in which the existing society has tortured one's magnificent
capabilities—^that is the essence of Byronism* It represents the
demoralisation in the ranks of the
aristocracy
as much
as a
rebellion against the aristocracy* These men are therefore always
full of death-thoughts: the death-thoughts of Fascism fighting
in the last ditch, the death-thoughts of Jacobites; the glorifica-
tion of a heroic death justifying a more dubious life* The same
secret death-wishes are shown by these'^aristocrats if they turn
revolutionary,
performing
deeds
of
outstanding
individual
heroism—sometimes unnecessary, sometimes useful, but always
romantic and
single-handed* They
cannot
rise beyond
the
conception of the desperate hero of revolution*
Shelley, however,
expresses
a
far more genuinely dynaniic
force* He speaks for the bourgeoisie who, at this stage of his-
tory, feel themselves ,,the dynamic force of society and therefore
voice demands not merely for themselves but for the whole of
suffering humanity*
It seems to them that if only
they could

necessary for their own freedom, this would of itself ensure the
freedom of all Shelley believes that he speaks for all men, for
all sufferers, calls them all to a brighter future. The bourgeois
trammelled by
the
restraints
of the
era
of mercantilism
is
Prometheus, bringcr of fire, fit symbol of the machine-wielding
capitalist. Free him and the world is free. A Godwinist, Shelley
believed that man is naturally good—institutions debase him.
Shelley is the most revolutionary of the bourgeois poets of this
era because Prometheus Unbound is not an excursion into the past,
but a revolutionary programme for the present. It tallies with
Shelley's
own
intimate
participation
in
the
bourgeois-
democratic revolutionary movement of his day.
Although Shelley is an atheist, he is not a materialist. He is
an
idealist. His vocabulary
is,
for the
first time,
consciously
idealist—that
is,
full of words
like
''brightness",
"truth",
"beauty", "soul", "aether", "wings", "fainting", "panting",
which
stir a whole world of indistinct emotions. Such com-
plexes,
because
of
their
numerous
emotional
associatibns,
appear to make the word indicate one distinct concrete entity,
although in fact no such entity exists, but each word denotes a
variety of different concepts.
This idealism
is a reflection of the revolutionary bourgeois
belief that,
once the
existing social relations that hamper a
human being are shattered, the "natural man will be realised"
’—^his
feelings,
his
emotions,
his
aspirations,
will
all
be
immediately bodied forth as material realities* Shelley does not
see that these shattered social relations can only give place to
the social relations of the class strong enough to shatter them
and that in any case these feelings,
aspirations and emotions
are the product of the social relations in which he exists and
that to realise them a social act is necessary, which in turn has
its effect upon a man's feelings, aspirations and emotions.
The bourgeois illusion is, in the sphere of poetry, a revolt.
In Wordsworth the revolt takes the form of a return to the
natural man,
just
as
it
does
in
Shelley.
Wordsworth,
like
Shelley profoundly influenced by French Rousseauism,
seeks
freedom, beauty—^all that
is not now in man because of his
social
relations—in "Nature". The French Revolution now
intervenes.
The
bourgeois demand
for freedom has now
a

V
ENGLISH POETS
93
regressive
tinge*
It no
longer
looks forward
to freedom by
revolt but by return to the natural man*
Wordsworth's ''Nature" is of course a Nature freed of wild
beasts and danger by aeons of human work, a Nature in which
the poet, enjoying a comfortable income, lives on the products
of industrialism even while he enjoys the natural scene "un-
spoilt" by industrialism* The very division of industrial capit-
alism
from
agricultural
capitalism
has now
separated
the
country from the town* The
division of labour involved in
industrialism has made it possible for sufficient surplus produce
to exist to maintain a poet in austere idleness in Cumberland*
But to see the relation between the two, to see that the culture,
gift of language and leisure which distinguish a Nature poet
from a dumb sub-human are the product of economic activity
—to
see
this would be to pierce the bourgeois
illusion and
expose the
artificiality of "Nature" poetry* Such poetry can
only arise at a time when man by industrialism has mastered
Nature—but not himself*
Wordsworth
therefore
is
a
pessimist*
Unlike
Shelley,
he
revolts regressively—^but still in a bourgeois way—by demand-
ing freedom from social relations, the specific social relations of
industrialism, while
still retaining the products, the freedom,
which these relations alone make possible*

products of man's struggle with Nature* They merely represent
different spheres and stages of that struggle and are good or
bad not in themselves, but in relation to this struggle* Under
the spell of this theory some of Wordsworth's worst poetry is
written*
Wordsworth's
form
of
the
bourgeois
illusion
has
some
kinship with Milton's* Both exalt the natural man, one in the
form of Puritan "Spirit", the other in the more sophisticated
form
of pantheistic "Nature"* One
appeals
to
the primal

the other to the

their best when consciously noble and elevated. Milton, react-
ing against primitive accumulation and its deification of naive
princely desire and will, does
not, however—as Wordsworth
does—glorify the wild element in man, the natural primitive.
Hence he
is saved from a technical theory
that conduces to
'
^sinking' ^ in poetry.
Keats
is the
first great poet to feel the strain of the poet's
position in this stage of the bourgeois illusion, as producer for
the
free market. Wordsworth has
a small income;
Shelley,
although always in want, belongs to a rich family and his want
is 'due simply to carelessness, generosity and the impracticability
which
is
often
the
reaction of
certain
temperaments
to
a
wealthy home. But Keats comes of a small bourgeois family and
is always pestered by money problems. The sale of his poems is
an important consideration to him.
For Keats therefore freedom does not lie, like Wordsworth,
in
a
return
to
Nature;
his
returns
to Nature were
always
accompanied
by
the
uncomfortable
worry,
where
was
the
money coming from?
It could not
lie,
as with Shelley,
in a
release from the social relations of this world, for mere formal
liberty would
still leave the individual with the problem of
earning a living. Keats' greater knowledge of bourgeois reality
therefore led him to a position which was to set the keynote
for
future
bourgeois
poetry:
^ devolution"
as
a
flight from
reality.
Keats
is the bannerbearer of the Romantic
Revival.
The poet now escapes upon the ^dapid wings of poesy"
to a
world of romance, beauty and sensuous life separate from the
poor,
harsh,
real world of everyday
life, which
it sweetens
and by
its own loveliness silently condemns.
This world is the shadowy enchanted world built by Lamia
for her lover or by the Moon for Endymion. It is the golden-
gated upper world of Hyperion, the word-painted lands of the
nightingale,
of the Grecian urn,
of Baiae's
isle. This other
world is defiantly counterposed to the real world*
**Beauty is truth, truth beauty*'—^that is all
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.
And always it is threatened by stern reality in the shape of
sages,
rival powers or the drab forces of everyday.

redress the balance of the old, but however much voyaged in,
it is still only a world of fancy*
A new
vocabulary
emerges
with
Keats,
the
dominating
vocabulary
of
future
poetry*
Not
Wordsworth's—because
the appei
is not to the unspoilt simplicity of the country*
Not Shelley's—^because the appeal
is not to the ^hdeas" that
float on the surface of real material life and can be skimmed
off like froth* The country is a part of the real material world,
and the froth of these metaphysical worlds is too unsubstantial
and therefore
is always a reminder of the real world which
generated it* A world must be constructed which is more real
precisely because
it
is more
unreal and has
sufficient
inner
stiffness
to
confront the real world with the self-confidence
of a successful conjuring trick*
Instead of taking,
like Wordsworth and
Shelley, what
is
regarded
as
the most
natural,
spiritual
or
beautiful part of
the real world,
a new world
is built up out of words,
as by
a mosaic artist, and these words therefore must have solidity
and
reality* The
Keatsian vocabulary
is
full of words with
a hard material texture,
like tesserae, but it
is an

texture—all crimson, scented, archaic,
stiff, jewelled and anti-
contemporary*
It
is
as vivid
as missal painting*
Increasingly

world*
It
is
a
bourgeois
world—the
world
of
the
Gothic
cathedrals and all the growing life and vigour of the bourgeois
class under late feudalism* Here too poetic revolution has a
strong regressive
character,
just as
it had with Wordsworth,
but
had
not
with
the most
genuinely
revolutionary
poet,
Shelley*
The
bourgeois,
with
each
fresh
demand
he
makes
for
individualism,
free
competition,
absence
of
social
relations
and more
equality, only brings to birth greater organisation,
more complex social relations, higher degrees of trustification
and combination, more inequality* Yet each of these contra-
dictory movements
revolutionises
his
basis and
creates new
productive forces. In the same way the bourgeois revolution,
expressed in the poetry
of
Shelley, Wordsworth and Keats,
although
it
is contradictory in its movement, yet brings into
being vast new technical resources for poetry and revolutionises
the whole apparatus of the art.
The basic movement is in many ways parallel to the move-
ment of primitive accumulation which gave rise to Elizabethan
poetry* Hence there was at this era among poets a revival of
interest in Shakespeare and the
Elizabethans* The insurgent
outburst of the
genetic
individuality which
is
expressed
in
Elizabethan
poetry had
a
collective
guise,
because
it was
focused
on
that
collective
figure,
the
prince*
In
romantic
poetry
it
has
a more
artificial
air
as an
expression of the
sentiments
and
the
emotions
of the
individual
figure,
the
^ ^independent*^ bourgeois* Poetry has separated itself from the
story, the heart from tlie intellect, the individual from society;
all
is more
artificial, differentiated and complex.
The poet now begins
to show
the marks of commodity-
production* We shall analyse this
still further when,
as in a
latjer
date,
it
sets
tlie whole key for poetry* At present the
most important sign
is Keats* statement*
that he could write
for ever, burning his poems afterwards* The poem has become
already an end in itself*
But it is more important to note the air of tragedy that from
now on looms over
all
bourgeois
poetry
that
is worth
the
adjective
*
"great***
Poetry
has become
pessimistic and
self-
lacerating* Byron, Keats and Shelley die young* And though it

V
ENGLISH POETS
97
is usual
to
regret
that they died with their best works un-
written, the examples of Wordsworth, Swinburne and Tenny-
son make fairly clear that this is not the case, that the personal
tragedy of their deaths, which in the case of Shelley and Byron
^
at least seemed sought, prevented the tragedy of the bourgeois
illusion working itself out impersonally in their poetry* For
the contradiction which secures the movement of capitalism
was now unfolding so rapidly that it exposed itself in the life-
time of a poet and always in the same way* The ardent hopes,
the aspirations,
the faiths of the poet's youth melted or
else
were repeated in the face of a changed reality with a stiffness
and
sterility that Betrayed the lack of conviction and made
them a mocking caricature of their youthful sincerity* True,
all men grow old and lose their youthful hopes—but not in
this way* A middle-aged Sophocles can speak with searching
maturity of the tragedy of his
life, and at eighty he writes a
drama that reflects the open-eyed serenity of wisdom's child
grown aged* But mature bourgeois poets
are not capable of
tragedy or resignation, only of a dull repetition of the faiths
of youth—or
silence* The movement of history
betrays the
contradiction for what it
is, and yet forces the bourgeois to
cling to it* From that moment the lie has entered his soul, and
by shutting his eyes to the consciousness of necessity, he has
delivered his soul to slavery*
In the French Revolution the bourgeoisie,
in the name of
liberty,
equality
and
fraternity,
revolted
against
obsolete
social relations* They claimed,
like Shelley,
to speak in the
name of all mankind; but then arose, at first indistinctly, later
with continually increasing clarity, the claim of the proletariat
also demanding liberty,
equality and fraternity* But to grant
these
to
the
proletariat
means
the
abolition
of
the
very
conditions which secure the
existence of the bourgeois
class
and the exploitation of the
proletariat* Therefore the move-
ment for freedom, which at first speaks largely in the voice of
mankind,
is always halted
at a
state where
the bourgeoisie
must betray its ideal structure expressed in poetry, forget that
it claimed to speak for humanity, and crush the class whose
like demands are irreconcilable with its own existence* Once
robbed
of
its
mass
support,
the

bourgeoisie

always be beaten back a stage by the forces of reaction. True,
these forces have learned "^a sharp lesson'* and do not proceed
too far against the bourgeoisie who have shown their power.
Both

Ensues
an
equilibrium when
the
bourgeoisie
have
betrayed
their
talk
of
freedom,
and
compromised
their

structure,
only
themselves to have lost part of the ideal fruit of their struggle
to the more reactionary forces—feudal forces, if the struggle is
against feudalism, landowning and big financial forces, if the
struggle
is between agricultural and industrial capitalism.
Such a movement was that from Robespierre to the Directory
and the anti-Jacobin movement which as a result of the French
Revolution
swept
Europe
everywhere.
The
whole
of
the
nineteenth century is a record of the same betrayal, which in
the life of the poets expresses itself as a betrayal of youthful
idealism.
1830,
1848 and,
finally,
1871
are the dates which
make all bourgeois poets now tread
tlie path of Wordsworth,
whose revolutionary fire, as the result of the proletarian content
of the
final
stage of the French
Revolution, was suddenly
chilled and gave place
to common
sense,
respectability and
piety.
It was Keats who wrote:
'*None can usurp this height**, the shade returned,
**Save those to whom the misery of the world
Is misery and will not let them rest.**
The doom of bourgeois poets in this epoch
is precisely that
the misery of the world, including their own special misery,
will not let them rest, and yet the temper of the time forces
them
to support the
class which
causes
it. The proletarian
revolution
has
not
yet
advanced
to
a
stage
where
^*some
bourgeois ideologists, comprehending the historical movement
as a whole", can ally themselves with it and really speak for
suffering humanity and for a class which is the majority now
and the whole world of men to-morrow. They speaJk only for
a class that is creating the world of to-morrow willy-nilly, and
at each step draws back and betrays its instinctive aspirations
because
of
its
conscious knowledge
that
this world of
to-
morrow it is creating, cannot include
itself.

ENGLISH POETS
(III. The Decline of Capitalism)
I
Arnold,
Swinburne, Tennyson and Browning,
each
in
his
own way,
illustrate the movement of the bourgeois
illusion
in this
'
'tragic^ ^ stage of its history.
Tennyson's
Keatsian
world
is
shattered
as
soon
as
he
attempts
to .compromise between
the world of beauty and
the
real world of misery which will not
let him rest. Only
the

Memoriamy with
its profound pessimism,
the
most genuinely pessimistic poem in English up to this dat^,
in any way
successfully
mirrors
contemporary problems
in
contemporary terms.
Like Darwin, and even more Darwin's followers, he projects
the conditions of capitalist production into Nature (individual
struggle for existence) and then reflects this struggle, intensified
by its instinctive and therefore unalterable blindness, back into
society, so that God—symbol of the internal forces of society
—^seems captive to Nature—^symbol of the
external environ-
ment of society:
Are God and Nature then at strife,
That Nature lends such evil dreams?
So careful of die type she seems,
So careless of the single life;
That
I, considering everywhere
Her secret meaning in her deeds,
And jSnding that of fifty seeds
She often brings but one to bear,
I falter where I firmly trod.
*

The
unconscious
rutlilessness
of
Tennyson's
‘‘Nature"
in
fact only
reflects
the
ruthlessness of a
society
in which
capitalist
is
continually hurling down
fellow-capitalist
into
the proletarian abyss:
*'Sq careful of the type?” but no.
From scarped cliff and quarried stone
She cries: ”A thousand types arc gone:

A discord. Dragons of the prime
Which tear each other in the slime
Were mellow music matched with him.
O life as futile, then, as frail!
O for thy voice to soothe and bless!
What hope of answer, or redress
Behind the veil, behind the veil?
Browning revolts from the drab present not to the future
but to the glories of the virile Italian springtime of the bour-
geoisie. Never before had that vigour been given in English
poetry so deep a colouring. But his vocabulary has a foggy
verbalism which
is a reflection of his
intellectual dishonesty
in
dealing with
real
contemporary problems. To Tennyson
the
Keatsian
world
of romance,
to
Browning
the
It^ian
springtime;
both
are
revolting
backwards,
trying
to
escape
from
the
contradiction of the
class
for whom
they
speak.
Browning dealing with contemporary problems, can produce
no higher poetry than that of Mr. Sludge or Bishop Blougram.
Yet he too in his eager youth could reproach an older bourgeois
poet for following the familiar round of reaction:
Shakespeare was of us, Milton was for us,
Burns, Shelley was with us—They watch from their graves!
He alone breaks from the van and the freemen,
He alone sinks to the rear and the slaves!
Swinburne's poetry
is
Shelley's world of immanent light
and
beauty made
more
separate
by
being
stiffened
with
something of the materiality and hypnotic heaviness of Keats'
world. Fate, whether as Hertha or the Nemesis of Atalanta in

VI
ENGLISH POETS
lOI
Calydon,^
is no
longer
tragic,
but
sad,
sad
as
the
death of
Baudelaire* Swinburne
is profoundly moved by the appeal of
the
contemporary
bourgeois-democratic
revolutions
taking
place all over Europe (1848-1871), but the purely verbal and
shallow character of his response reflects the essential shallow-
ness of all such movements in this late era when, owing to the
development of the
proletariat, they almost instantly negate
themselves*
Arnold's poems breathe the now characteristic '^pessimism"
of the bourgeois illusion, which is now working out its
final
and (to itself) tragic stages* Arnold battles against the Philistine,
but he has an uneasy suspicion that he is doomed to lose* And
in fact he
is, for he fights his mirror reflection* As long as he
moves
within
the
categories
of
bourgeois
society
his own
movement produces the Philistine; he drives on the movement
which generates Philistine and poet, by separating the poet
from society*
2
The
next
phase
of bourgeois
poetry
is
therefore
that
of
^'commodity-fetishism"—or "art for art's sake"—and is given
in the false position of the bourgeois poet as producer for the
market,
a
position
forced on him by
the
development
of
bourgeois economy* As soon as the pessimism of Arnold and
the young Tennyson, and the even sadder optimism of Browning
and Swinburne and the old Tennyson when dealing with the
contemporary scene, made
it inevitable that the poet quit the
contemporary
scene,
it was
equally inevitable that the poet
should
fall
a victim
to
commodity-fetishism* This meant a
movement which would completely separate the world of art
from the world of reality and, in doing so, separate it from the
source of art itself so that the work would burst like a bubble
just when it seemed most self-secure*
Engels in Anti-~Duhring very clearly explains the characteristic
of every society based on commodity-production:
[It] has the peculiarity that in it the producers have lost control of their
own social relationships. Each produces for himself, with the means of pro-
duction which happen to be at his disposal and in order to satisfy his indi-
vidual needs through the medium of exchange. No one knows how much of

102
ILLUSION AND REALITY
VI
the article he produces is coming on the market* or how much demand there
is for itj no one knows whether his individual product will meet a real need,
whether he will cover his costs or even be able to sell at all. Anarchy reigns
in social production. But commodity production,
like
all other forms of
production, has
its own laws, which are inherent and inseparable from
it;
and these laws assert themselves in spite of anarchy, in and through anarchy.
.
.
. They assert themselves, therefore, apart from the producers and against
the producers,
as the natural laws of their form of production, working
blindly. The p'oduct dominates the producers.
Engels
contrasts
this with
the
older and more
universal
method of production for use instead of exchange. Here the
origin and end of production are clearly seen. All arc part of
the one social act, and the product is only valued in so far as
it is of use to the society which produces
it. In such a society
the poem as such derives
its value from its collective appear-
ance, from the effect it has on the hearts of its heaters and the
impact, direct and evident, on the life of the tribe.
In
capitalist production,
which
is commodity
production
in
excelstst
all
this
is
altered.
Everyone produces blindly for
a market whose laws are unfathomable, although they assert
themselves with iron rigidity. The impact of the commodity
upon the life of society cannot be measured or seen. ^'Man has
lost control of his social relationships/' The whole elaborate
warp and woof of capitalism, a complex web spun in anarchy,
makes this helplessness inevitable.
To the poet the bourgeois market’ appears as the ‘^public".
The invention and -development of printing and publishing
was part of the development of the universal bourgeois
free
market.
Just
as
the
development
of
this
market
(by
the
extension of colonisation and transport and exchange facilities)
made
it possible for a man to produce for places whose very
names he did not know, much less their location, so the poet
now writes for men of whose existence he
is ignorant, whose
social life, whose whole mode of being is strange to him. The
'
market is for him ^^The Public"—
^blind, strange, passive*
.
This
leads
to what Marx
called "commodity-fetishism",
*
The
social
character
of
the
art-process,
so
evident
in
the
collective festival, now disappears, "A commodity is therefore
a mysterious
thing, simply because in
it the social character

*
*
* In the same
way the light from an object

form of something outside the eye itself*"^ In the same way the
art work, once its social realisation in the hearts of society
is
veiled by the
' ^market*
^ or the
' ^public’^ appears to the poet
as something objective* This
is helped by the swing-over of
art from forms visibly dependent on men in association—the
dance,
the song, music, the spontaneous drama and commedia
deir am—^to crystallised records of the art process not therefore
visibly dependent on society—the written poem, the musical
score,
the
written
play,
the
picture
or
sculpture* The

stimulus becomes objective—a commodity*
Capitalist production

its movement—capital*

of
capital*
This
constant
capital
takes
the
visible form of
elaborate
factory
plant and
indirectly
the
more
highly-de-
veloped technique and organisation necessary to use this plant*
This growth of constant capital and therefore of social organisa-
tion due to increasing productivity of labour contrasts with the
growth of individualism in ownership and appropriation due
to the increasing wealth of private capitalists* In the same way
bourgeois poetry is marked by a continually increasing sum of
tradition and technique, of which the poet feels the pressure,
so that there is a continual contradiction between the tremend-
ous
social
experience
embodied
in
the poem and
the
in-
dividualistic and anti-social attitude of the poet* **Tradition*^
towers
up
before
the
poet
as
something
formidable
and
tremendous, with which he must settle accounts as an ego*

the
capitalist

takes
the

sacralisation
of

of
all

far
as he

a purely
capitalist mentality* He may even himself exploit
labour by means of secretaries and hacks who do his

VI
104
ILLUSION AND REALITY
artist, for it is the characteristic of the artist that his products
are
adaptative,
that
the
artistic
illusion
is begotten
of the
tension between instinct and consciousness, between productive
forces and productive relations, the very tension which drives
on
all
society
to
future
reality.
In
bourgeois
society
this
tension
is
that between
the
productive
forces
(the
socially
organised power of capitalist technique in the factories) and
the
social
relations
(production
for
private
profit and
the
resulting anarchy in the market as a whole indicated by die
universdity of the money or ‘‘exchange*'
relation instead of
the direct or “use" relation). Because this is the fundamental
contradiction, the poet “revolts" against the system of profit-
making
or
production
for
exchange-value
as
crippling
the
meaning and
significance of
art.
But
as long
as he
revolts
within the
categories of bourgeois thought— that
is,
as long
as he cannot cast off the basic bourgeois illusion—his revolt
takes
a form made
necessary by
the
.system of commodity
production.
3
The exploited—of which the poet thus becomes one—^are
of two kinds in capitalist production: These two kinds,
the
labourer and the craftsman, may be regarded as descendants
of
the
serfs
and
artisans
of medieval
days.
However,
the
lineage is not direct. Serfs became capitalists and artisans were
hurled down into the proletariat during the capitalist revolu-
tion. The
exploited may be regarded
as descendants
of the
one
class of artisans. The
labourer has been thoroughly pro-
letarianised; the craftsman^ for special reasons, has still retained
a measure
of privilege
in
capitalist production which
gives
him the illusion of belonging to the “middle
class",
a class
immune from and superior to die class
struggle' as a whole.
None the less, the proletarian abyss yawns always beneath his
feet.
His
privilege
is an
accident
of a
particular
stage
of
capitalist production and is always being torn from his grasp.
However,
the historical change of capitalist production pro-
duces
always new members
of
this
class,
which
therefore
appears always to have a certain stability and separate existence,
although
its
actual composition
is
in a
state of wild
flux.

VI
ENGLISH POETS
105
The
final stages of capitalism reveal the fallacy of even this
phantom
separation,
and
the
petty
bourgeoisie
finds
its
privileges being torn from its hands*
Let us examine the main history of these two divisions in
England*
(i) The Lalourer ,—He is the man who works drably, monoton-
ously and
at
the most-sweated
wages,
a mere
cog
in
the
machine* He is the proletarian proper, the unique creation of
capitalism* His fight against the capitalist
is most bitter and
uncompromising because his work, by its very nature,
is of a
kind it is impossible to like, and therefore his revolt is expressed
as a fight for leisure, an attempt to snatch from his employers'
reluctant hands every
extra hour of decent human existence
outside the factory* This fight goes with a struggle for higher
wages,
to make those short hours of leisure as full and free
as possible*
This
is
the only form his struggle
for freedom can
take
within the categories of capitalist production, for in his dull
task freedom expresses itself as the opposite to social activity
or ^Vork"* Because he constitutes the majority of those from
.
the surplus value of whose labour-power me capitalist derives
his
profit,
the antagonism between the two
classes
is naked
and
direct*
This
antagonism
is
the
real
core
of the
class
struggle
in
capitalist
society* Each minute of his
leisure
or
penny of his wages is so much from the capitalist's profit* His
freedom
is precisely the capitalist's unfreedom, and vice versa.
(ii)
The
Craftsman .—^Xhis
class,
as
foreman,
overseer,
or
mechanic,
or in a profession as barrister,
doctor, engineer or
architect,
occupies a special position in capitalist production
because of his personal skill, technique or *^key" job* Because
of his favoured position, his delight in his skill, and his higher
wages, the craftsman finds himself often in opposition to the
genuine
proletariat* Work
for him does not stand
in such
sharp opposition to
leisure, or his freedom to the capitalist's
freedom, as in the case of the labourer* Somietimes he is even
in business ‘hn a small way" himself, not as a capitalik, but
employing two
or
three
apprentice-assistants and
selling
to
large capitalists* This apparent cleavage of interests is expressed
in these workers'
organisations* The

Liberal
traditions of the “Junta"
that
had, at an earlier date, ousted the original militant but badly
organised lodges.
None
the
less,
the
development of
capitalist
production
remorselessly turns the craftsman into a labourer. The machine
competes with and ousts the product of his skilled hands in
all departments and
forces him into the “industrial
reserve
army" of the unemployed.
The effect is at first to make him revolt against the demands
of a “commercialised" market by setting up his skill as a good
in
itself,
detached from
social
uses. You
will hear such a
craftsman admire an old Napier car, for example, as a superb
production of skilled craftsmen, and compare it witli a modern
mass-producHon
Ford, which
fulfils the same social
rfile and
is
cheaper. The
old
skill,
although more
wasteful
of human
labour, has acquired a specif value to the craftsman because
it is the condition for his existence as a class distinct from the
proletariat^ and
is
set over and against
the market with
its
criterion of profit, which is the cause of the outdating of his
skill*
Eventually, employed
as
a factory hand, he may
still
cherish His outdated skill by making models, by indulging in
little private ^‘hobbies'' and other socially meaningless activities
that exercise his craft.
In
this
his attitude
is fundamentally akin
to
that of the
writer. The
writer's
relation to capitalism
is
also
privileged
and craft, although
its
''ideal" content gives it a still higher
privilege than manual craftsmanship in an age where the class
division has separated thinking from doing. The writer. is a
part
of upper
bourgeois
society,
like
the
doctor,
barrister,
architect,
teacher
or
scientist
whose
work
has
a
similar
theoretical content—the manual craftsman is never more than
"lower middle
class". None
the
less,
both find diemselves
expressing
the* special aspirations and delusions of the petty
bourgeoisie.
Just
as the growth of capitalism tends more and more

whelm all industrial production in mass production, expropriate
artisans in thousands, and proletarianise the craftsman to the
level of a labourer or machine-minder, so it has the same effect
in the realm of art. Mass-production art enforces a dead level
of mediocrity. Good
art becomes
less saleable. Because
art^s
role is now that of adapting the multitude to the dead mechan-
ical existence of capitalist production,
in which work sucks
them of their vital energies without awakening their instincts,
where leisure becomes a time
to deaden the mind with the
easy
phantasy
of
films,
simple
wish-fulfilment
writing,
or
music that
is mere emotional massage—^because of this
the
paid craft of writer becomes as tedious and wearisome as that
of
machine-minder.
Journalism
becomes
the
characteristic
product of the age. Films, the novel and painting all share in
the
degradation.
Immense
technical
resources
and
steady
debasement and stereotyping of the human psyche are charac-
teristics
alike
of factory production and
factory
art in
this
stage of capitalism. Let any artist who has had to earn a living
by journalism or writing
^‘thrillers^*
testify to the inexorable
proletarianisation of his
art. The modern thriller, love story,
cowboy romance,
cheap
film,
jazz music
or yellow Sunday
paper form the
real
proletarian
literature of to-day—^that
is,
literature which
is
the
characteristic accompaniment of the
misery and
instinctual poverty produced in the majority of
people by modern capitalist production. It is literature which
proletarianises the writer.
It
is at once an expression of real
misery and a protest against that real misery. This art, universal,
constant,
fabulous,
full of the easy gratifications of instincts
starved by modern
capitalism,
peopled by passionate
lovers
and heroic cowboys and amazing detectives,
is the religion of
to-day, as characteristic an expression of proletarian exploitation
as Catholicism
is of feudal exploitation.
It
is the opium of
the people;
it pictures an inverted world because the world of
society
is inverted. It is the real characteristic art of bourgeois
civilisation,
expressing
the
real
and
not
the
self-appraised
content of the bourgeois illusion. ^"High-brow^^ bourgeois art
grows on the
bourgeois
class's
freedom.
^^Low-brow"
pro-
letarian art grows on the proletariat's unfreedom and helps,
by
its massage of the starved revolting instincts, to maintain

Io8
ILLUSION AND REALITY
VI
that unfreedom in being. Because
it
is mere massage, because
it helps to maintain man in unfreedom and not to express his
spontaneous creation, because of that,
it
is bad art. Yet
it
is
an art which is far more really characteristic, which plays a far
more important and
all-pervasive
r61e
in
bourgeois
society
than, for example, the art of James Joyce.
The poet
, is the most craft of writers. His arc requires the
highest degree of technical skill of any artist; and it is precisely
this technical skill which is not wanted by the vast majority of
people in a developed capitalism. He
is as out of date as a
medieval stone-carver in an era of plaster casts. As thd' virtual
proletarianisation of society increases, the conditions of men’s
work,
robbed
of spontaneity,
more
and more make them
demand a mass-produced “low-brow”
art, whose flatness and
shallowness serve to adapt them to their unfreedom. The poet
becomes a “high-brow”, a man whose skill is not wanted. It
becomes too much trouble for the average man to read poetry.
Because of the conditions of his
life, the poet's reaction is
similar to that of the craftsman. He begins to set craft skill in
opposition to social function, “art” in opposition to “life”. The
craftsman’s particular version of commodity-fetishism is sMl-
fetishism. Skill now seems an objective thing, opposed to social
value. The art work therefore becomes valued in and for itself.
But the art work lives in a world of society. Art works are
always composed of objects that have a social reference. Not
mere noises but words from a vocabulary, not chance sounds
but notes from a socially-recognised scale, not mere blobs but
forms with a meaning, are what constitutes the material of art.
All these things have emotional associations wliich are social.
Yet if an art work
is valued for
its own sake in defiant and
rebellious opposition to the sake of a society wliich now has no
use for skill, it is in fact valued/of the artist's sake. One cannot
simply construct random poems. If their associations are not
social they are personal, and the more the art work is opposed
to society, the more are personal associations defiantly selected
which are exclusive of social—^bizarre, strange, phantastic. In
this stage of the bourgeois illusion therefore poetry exhibits a
rapid movement from the social world of art to the personal
world of private phantasy. This
leads
to
individualism.
In

the
poet,
because

remains
within the sphere of bourgeois categories, simply moves on to
an extreme individualism, utter “loss of control of his social

and
absolute
commodity-production—to
the
essence, in fact, of the capitalism he condemns. He is the com-
plete mirror-revolutionary.
And
his

This movement into the world of “art for art’s sake”
Le.
“art for my sake”—of course is well marked in England with
Rossetti, Morris before he became a socialist, Wilde and to a
certain extent Hopkins. But in this epoch of the final stage of
capitalism
the
movement
becomes
most
rapid
in
other
countries.
England,
the
quickest
to
develop
methods
of
capitalist production, is slowest to decline. The final movement
in bourgeois art is accomplished most fully in other countries.
The movement
is seen in
its purity in France.
Baudelaire
begins it: “II ne peut ^tre du progr^s (vrai, c’est k dire moral)
que dans I’individu et par I’individu lui-m^me”. Verlaine aud
Rimbaud continue
it, though Rimbaud, allying himself with
the Commune, passes from poetry with the collapse of the first
proletarian dictatorship.
From then on the movement develops via the Parnassians,
through the symbolists,
to
its climax in the surrealistes. With
the
Parnassians, the word
is valued for
its marmoreal
craft
qualities;
with
the
symbolists
for
the
vague pentrabra
of
emotional associations lying beyond the word—^t^t is, for its
extra-social
associations—; with the surrealistes directly for its
private unconscious significance. The transition from Heredia
via Laforgue to Apollinaire is surprisingly rapid and d^.
In Fngland poetry
at
first seems exhausted. The universal
movement of the bourgeois economy which is debasing all art,
or making it mbve to-surrhlisme, is halted in England by little
“pockets”
or sheltered occupations, representing the reserves
of England’s long bourgeois summer. The coimtry

and protected by the rich
industrial
capitalist who
finds
it
better
to
exploit
ruthlessly
the
colonial
'^country''
for raw
material and keep some vestige of idyllic relations around him
—is one such pocket; it gives us Hardy and a succession of less
gnarled country poets such as Thomas and Davies, Oxford and
Cambridge
are other such pockets;
they
give us Housman,
Flecker, Brooke and various other ^^Gcorgiaii
' poets. The war
closes this period In 1929 the final economic crisis of capitalism
affects' even England, and English poetry too moves rapidly
towards symbolism and the most logically consistent expression
of poetic craft revolt
surrialisme.
The surrhliste
is somewhat equivalent to the craftsman who
makes trifling models and toys in his spare time to exercise his
skill. This
is the way he expresses his revolt and secures some
free outlet for his craft, by deliberately making something of
its nature useless and therefore opposed to the sordid craftless-
ness of mass-production. We will deal later with the aesthetic
theory of surrhlisme and
the importance
it
attaches
to
the
Unconscious, when we have had time
to
consider
the
real
function of the instincts and of the Unconscious in art. At the
moment we need only point out
that,
so
far from the
free
association whiih
is the basis of surrealistic technique being
really
free,
it
is
far more compulsive than ordinary
rational
association, as Freud, Jung and MacCurdy have clearly shown.
In rational association images are controlled by a social experi-
ence of reality—^the consciousness of necessity. In free associa-
tion the images are controlled by the iron hand of the uncon-
scious
instincts—and
it
is
therefore no more
free than
the
'"thinking^'
of the
ant, Man becomes
free
jiot by
realising
himself
in
opposition
to
society
but
by
realising
himself
through society, and the character of the association in itself
imposes certain common forms, and conventions which are the
badge of his freedom. But because the surrhliste is a bourgeois
and has
lost
control of his
social
relationships,
he
believes
freedom to
consist in revolting against these forms whereby
freedom has been realised in the past* Social activity, the means
of freedom,
is—^because
its products
are
appropriated more
completely by individuals the more social the activity becomes
—opposed by a resolutely non-social activity which
is Jelt to

n
III
ENGLISH POETS
lonstitute freedom because
its products are useless to society
ind therefore cannot be appropriated by individuals* Of course
iiis
is an outside view of the process. Subjectively the artist
relieves himself to be realising an ideal freedom derived from
:he 'magic'' qualities of art works and the unique features of
lie artist's mind.
At each stage the bourgeois contradiction by unfolding itself
‘evolutionises its own base and secures a fresh development of
lechnical resources. Hence the movement from "art for art's
sake" to surrealisme secures a development of the technique of
poetry, of which in England Eliot is the best example owing to
the already-mentioned lag. But it cannot continue indefinitely.
The conflict between technical resources and content reaches a
limit where it explodes and begins to turn into its opposite. A
revolution of content,
as
opposed
to
a mere movement
of
technique, now begins, corresponding in the social sphere to a
change in productive relations as opposed to a mere improve-
ment in productive forces. As a result the social associations of
words
will
all be
re-cast,
and
the whole
subject-matter of
poetry will become
different, because language
itself
is now
generated in a different society. There will be a really revolu-
tionary movement from the categories of bourgeois poetry to
the categories of communist poetry.
The
surrialiste therefore
is the last bourgeois revolutionary.
To pass beyond him—beyond Milton, beyond Godwin, beyond
Pater, beyond
finally Dada and Dali,
is to pass beyond the
categories of bourgeois thought. What politically
is this final
bourgeois revolutionary? He is an anarchist.
The anarchist
is a bourgeois so disgusted with the develop-
ment of bourgeois society that he asserts the bourgeois creed in
the most essential way: complete "personal" freedom, com-
plete destruction of alf social
relations. The anarchist
is yet
revolutionary because he represents the destructive element and
the complete negation of all bourgeois society. But he cannot
really pass beyond bourgeois society, because he remains caught
in its toils. In the anarchic organisation of bourgeois economy
certain laws of organisation
still assert themselves, and there-
fore can only be shattered by a higher organisation, that of a
new ruling-classi

IIZ
ILLUSION AND REALITY
VI
The
anarchist
is
the
typical
revolutionary product of the
country where industrial capitalism has developed late under
*^hot-house*'
conditions and has resulted in the rapid prole-
tarianisation of a large number of artisans or petty bourgeois
craftsmen. It is a petty bourgeois creed. Hence its strength in
^late'* capitalist countries like Italy, Spain, Russia and France
—precisely the countries where the surrealistic tendency in art
is also most marked.
But it is also the character of surrealisme, as it is the character
of anarchy as a political philosophy, that it negates itself in prac-
tice. The
difference between communism and anarchy
as
a
political philosophy is that communism believes that bourgois
rule can only be successfully overthrown by an organised move-
ment. This organisation, expressed in soviets and trade unions,
is a direct outcome of the organisation forced on the proletariat
by the general conditions of capitalist economy. The anarchist,
however, has recently been a petty bourgeois, a peasant or an
artisan. He has not been organised for long in an industrial and
political struggle against the capitalist class. He therefore sees
revolution
as
an
individual
destruction
of authority which
would suffice to restore the conditions in which he enjoyed the
fruit of his own small-scale labour.
But in practice the anarchist discovers that the mere destruc-
tion of an outworn society,
let alone the building of a new,
requires organisation. The mere necessities of the task driye him
first into trade unions and then into the creation of soviets.
This was seen in the Russian Revolution, when the sincere
Social
Revolutionaries were mostly
forced,
by
the
logic
of
events, to the Bolshevik standpoint, and again in Spain, where
in
Barcelona
the
anarchists
have
had
to
support
a
strong
Central
Government,
help
in
the
organisation
of
militia,
defence and supplies, and in every wscf negate their own creed.
Hence the truth of the old joke as to the anarchist s code:
*Tara.
i. There shall be no order at all.
*Tara.
2. No
one
shall be
obliged
to
comply
with
the
preceding paragraph* \
and the significance of the newspaper report after the Fascist

VI
ENGLISH POETS
revolt in Spain: **The anarchists are keeping order in Barcelona"'*
In the same way, as a revolutionary situation develops, the
surrealiste poets either retreat to reaction and Fascism (as many
in Italy) or are thrown into the ranks of the proletariat, like
Aragon in France.
In a country such as England, the final revolt of the crafts-
man usually takes a different form. The craftsman is not there
an independent artisan or petty bourgeois whose
first taste of
proletarianisation gives him a hatred of ''organisation
The
proletarianisation of the artisan took place in the late eighteenth
century in England, and because the possibilities of revolution
were more hopeless, his rebellion took the form of Ludditism
—the smashing of the machines which expropriated them. The
next great proletarianisation of the craftsman was marked by the
rise of the general labourers' unions in the face of the opposition
of the craft unions, and the struggle then was a struggle between
a developing
proletariat and
the
capitalists,
with
the
craft
unions standing aside.
.
Thus the final crisis in England found the craftsman a man
who, as the result of the long springtime of English capitalist
development, occupied a privileged position in production. He
formed the famous labour aristocracy who made
it seem as if
England, not content with a bourgeois aristocracy and a bour-
geois monarchy, aimed also at a bourgeois proletariat. In the
final crisis it soon became apparent that this favoured position
was only the expression of the temporary supremacy of England
in world capitalism and vanished with the growth of competi-
tion and tariffs. Unemployment, insecurity, wage-cuts and dis-
missals
as
the
result of rationalisation, from
1929 to 1936,
ravaged all the ranks of the "craft" and "professional" elements
of England just as, at a somewhat earlier date, they had those
of Germany. So, far,
however, from
proletarianisation in
all
cases producing an anarchic frame of mind in these types,
it
has an opposite effect in those who are "key" men rooted in the
heart of industry everywhere—in the tool-room of the factory,
as supervisors, foremen, technicians, specialists, managers and
consultants.
In
these
positions
they
find
that
their
skill
is
wasted,
not by the organisation of men into
factories, but
because the progress of 3iis organisation—^its logical conclusion
H

ILLUSION AND REALITY
VI
II4
in an immensely increased human productivity—is defeated by
the
characteristic anarchy of capitalist production—the indi-
vidual
o^vnership
and
mutual
competition
of
the
various
factories.
Hence their revolution against the system which is crippling
them
is
not
reactionary
in
content,
like
the
artisan's,
but
genuinely progressive, in that it demands greater organisation
—the extension of the organisation already obtaining in the
factories to production as a whole.
But though progressive in content,
it by no means follows
that
this demand will find an outcome in a progressive act.
Even at
this revolutionary stage the craftsman halts
at two
paths. One leads up to the bourgeoisie, with whom his respon-
sible position and higher salary have always associated him
indeed the doctor, architect, and artist, owing to the ''ideal"
concent of their work, have actually been a genuine part of the
bourgeoisie. The other path leads downward to the proletariat,
from whom his privileged position has alv^^ays sundered him
for proletarianisation, because it has involved worsened living
conditions, has been something to be avoided at all costs. Hence
he has an ingrained repulsion from alliance with the proletariat.
In the past he has measured his success and freedom by the dis-
tance he has climbed up from the proletariat to the bourgeoisie
—the
famous
petty
bourgeois
snobbery
and
exclusiveness
which is only the cold reflection of man's constant desire for
freedom.
If he
chooses
the upward
path,
he
chooses
organisation
imposed from
above
by
the
bourgeoisie—in
other
words.
Fascism. Of course this organisation
is a mere sham—it
is a'
cloak for further rationalisation, and the consolidating of the
power of the most reactionary section of the capitalist
class.
It results, not in the increased organisation of production but
in greater anarchy and more bitter competition. Rationalisation
is
in
fact
irrationalisation.
It leads to an increase in anarchy
outside and inside—internally by a profound disturbance in
economy resulting from the growth of armament and luxury
industry at the expense of necessities and a general lowering
of wages, and externally by an increase in tariffs and imperialism
and a general drive towards war. The only real organisation

VI
ENGLISH POETS
consists
in
the
counter-revolutionary
regimentation
of
the
proletariat and petty bourgeois
classes and
the smashing of
working-class organisations*
But equally the craftsman may choose the downward path^
and he is the more likely to do so as the development of the
industrial crisis and the objective examples of Fascism abroad
reveal the
inevitability of this move* This path
consists of
allying himself with the proletariat and extending the organisa-
tion of the workers within the factories to the organisation of
production as a whole by liquidating those rights which stand
in the way—individual ownership of the means of production*
Since this right is the real power of existing society, this means
the
substitution
of workers'
power
for
capitalists'
power*
When he makes this choice, the craftsman, because of his key
position
in
production,
his
privileged income
(giving him
more
leisure and
cultural
opportunities), and
his experience
of responsibility, becomes a natural leader of the proletariat,
instead of their most treacherous enemy, as he is when he is
allied with the bourgeoisie*
It is for this reason that the last three years in England have
been marked by the development of a revolutionary outlook
among those very craft and petty bourgeois types—the ^‘labour
aristocracy"—^who
formerly
displayed
all
the
reactionary
qualities that made a craft union notorious in this country and
made many of their spokesmen in Germany actual supporters
of
the
Fascist
regime*
Anyone
familiar
with
trade
union
affairs is aware that just as the craft unions and those industrial
unions with a strong craft composition formerly opposed the
general labourer's unions as being too militant and "socialist",
it
is now
the
craft and
semi-professional
unions
like
the
A*E*U*,
E*T*U*,
A*S*L*E. &
F*,
N*A*U*S*W* &
C*
and
N*U*C* who at the Trades Union Congress and through their
branches and Metropolitan Councils or District Committees
press
for militant action and are reproached by the general
unions for being too extreme and communist* In the same way
those
craftsmen whose
ideal
theoretical
content
has
given
them a special position among the bourgeoisie itself—doctors,
scientists,
architects and teachers—^are now moving Left and
entering
the
Communist
Party
in
considerable
numbers,

Il6
ILLUSION AND REALITY
VI
passing
straight
from
Liberalism
without
an
intermediate
sojourn in the Labour Party*
The same final movement of the bourgeois illusion is reflected
in
the growth of the
People's
Front,
where
all
the
liberal
elements,
representing the
craft content of modern
society,
put themselves under the leadership of the
proletariat
in
a
formal written alliance limiting the scope of that leadership*
In English poetry this
is reflected in the fact that English
poets, without ever moving completely into surrialiste anarchy,
change from
a position near
surrialismc
into
its opposite—^a
communist revolutionary
position,
such
as
that adopted by
Auden,
Lewis,
Spender
and
Lehmann* How
far
this
is
genuinely communist and what level of art it represents,
is a
consideration which will be deferred to our final chapter, for
with
this movement the bourgeois
contradiction passes
into
its
synthesis*
It now
starts
to
revolutionise,
not merely
its
productive forces but its own categories^ which now impossibly
restrict those productive forces which its tension has generated*
This movement
is
farther advanced
in
France,
with
Gide,
Rolland, Malraux and Aragon wearing the uniform at which
all once sneered* Here it has only begun*
We
have
surveyed
‘ briefly
the
most
important
general
determining forces influencing bourgeois English poetry* It is
now necessary
to change from a consideration of the
social
and historical movement which determines the poet's attitude
and produces that very tension which can only be
resolved
by poetry,
to a consideration of the movement of individual
creation—the specific way in which the individual responds to
this outward pressure and by a dialectic process imparts to
it
an impulsion from his own instinctive energy* Before we can
do so, we must survey the general technical characteristics of
poetry which condition his task*

THE CHARACTERISTICS OF POETRY
By poetiy we mean modem poetiy^ because not only have we
a special and intimate understanding of the poetry of our age
and time, but we look at the poetry of all ages through the
mist of our own* Modern poetry
is poetry which
is already
separate from story and has played a special part in the relation
of the consciousness of the developing bourgeois
class
to
its
surroundings*
What are the specific characteristics of this modern poetry
not
of good
modern
poetry,
but
of any modern
poetry?
Mimesis^
the
characteristic of Greek poetry,
is not a specific
characteristic
of
bourgeois
poetry
but
is common
to
the
bourgeois story and play*
The
characteristics which would make
a
given
piece
of
literature poetry for the sophisticated modern are as follows:
(a) Poetry
is rhythmic
The
marked rhythm
of
poetry,
superimposed upon
the
^
^natural"' rhythm of any language, seems
to have taken
its
root from two sources
(l)
It makes
easier declamation in common and
therefore
emphaCSises the collective nature of poetry* It is the impress of
the social mould in which poetry is generated* As a result the
nature of the rhythm expresses in a subtle and sensitive way
the
precise
balance
between
the
instinctive
or
emotional
^content of the poem and the social relations* through which
emotion realises
itself collectively* Thus any change in man s
self-valuation
of the
relation
of
his
instincts
to
society
is
reflected in his attitude to the metre and rhythmical conven-
tions into which he
is born, and which he therefore as poet
changes in one direction or another* We have already studied
in outline these changes in attitude toward metrical technique
during the movement of bourgeois English poetry, and
it
is

124
ILLUSION AND REALITY
VII
obvious that the final movement towards
^^free verse*
^ reflects
the
final
anarchic
bourgeois
attempt
to
abandon
all
social
relations in a blind negation of them, because man has com-
pletely lost control of his social relationships*
(2) But this brings us to a special feature of the bourgeois
contradiction
in
poetry—the
specific way
in which rhythm
facilitates
collective declamation and emotion* The body has
certain
natural
periodicities
(pulse-beat,
breath,
etc*) which
form a dividing line between the casual character of outside
events and the ego, and make it appear as if we experience time
subjectively in a special and direct manner* Any rhythmical
movement or
action
therefore
exalts
the
physiological com-
ponent of our conscious
field at the expense of the environ-
mental* It tends to produce introversion of a special kind, which
I
will
call
emotional
introversion and
contrast with
rational
introversion,
such
as
takes
place when we
concentrate on
a
mathematical problem*
There rhythm would be out of place*
Rhythm puts people at a collective
festival in touch with
each other in a particular way—^physiologically and emotion-
ally* They already
see each other, but this
is not the kind of
communion that is desired* On the contrary, when they cease
to see each other so clearly, when each retires darkly into his
body and shares the same physiological and elemental beat,
then they have a special herd commonness that is distinct j&om
the commonness of seeing each other in the same real world of
perceptual experience* It is instinctive commonness as opposed
to
conscious
commonness;
subjective
unity
as
opposed
to
objective unity* In emotional introversion men return to the
genotype, to the more or less common set of instincts in each
man which
is changed and adapted by
outer reality
in the
course of living*
This emotion^ introversion is in itself a social act* Society^
hangs together as a coherent working whole because men all
have the same equipment of instincts* The productive relations
into which a man
is born,
the environment he
enters
into,
mould his consciousness in a social way and also secure the
cohesion ^of any one
society*
It
is
true
that the same two
genotypes, one born into primitive Australian culture and the
other into modern European culture, would be different and

VII
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF POETRY
I25
if brought together later could not form one social complex^
But a monkey and a man born into the same culture would be
different too, in spite of their like surroundings, and could not
form
the same complex
either*
This
contradiction between
instinct and
cultural
environment
is
absolutely primary
to
society* Just as the specific form of it we have been analysing
drives on the development of capitalist society, so this general
contradiction
drives
on
the development of
all
society*
In
language
this
contradiction
is represented by the opposition
between the rational content or objective existence expressed
by words and the emotional
content
or
subjective
attitude
expressed by the same words*
It
is impossible to separate the
two completely, because they are given in the way language is
generated—in man^s
struggle with
Nature*
But
science
(or
reality)
is
the
special
field
of
the
former,
and
poetry
(or
illusion) the domain of the latter* Hence poetry in some form
is as eternal to society as man's struggle with Nature, a struggle
of which association in economic production is the outcome*
In poetry
itself this
takes the form of man entering
into
emotional communion with his fellow men by retiring into
himself* Hence when
the
bourgedis poet
supposes
that he
expresses his individuality and
flies from reality by entering
into a 'v^orld of art in his inmost* soul, he
is in fact merely
passing from the social world of rational reality to the social
world of emotional commonness* When the bourgeois poet
Ijecomes (as he thinks) anti-social and completely vowed to the
world of *'art for art's sake", his rhythm becomes increasingly
marked and hypnotically drowsy, as in Mallarm6's VAprh-miii
i*un Tame and Apollinaire's Alcools. Only when the bourgeois
passes to the anarchistic stage where he negates all bourgeois
society
and
deliberately
chooses
words
with
only
personal
associations, can rhythm vanish, for the poet now dreads even
the social bond of having instincts common with other men,
and
therefore
chooses
just
those words which
will
have
a
cerebral
peculiarity*
If he chooses words with
too strong an
emotional
association,
this,
coupled with
the hypnosis of a
strong rhythm,
will sink him into the common
lair of the
human instincts* Hence the
surrialiste technique of selecting
word combinations whose bizarre associations, though personal,

ILLUSION AND REALITY
VII
126
are not emotional but rational* Ultimately this is only possible
by
departing from language and
significance
altogether,
be-
cause
all
the
contents of consciousness
are both
genetically
and environmentally social in basis*
Thus, though rhythm is fundamental to poetry', it cannot be
dismissed with some
simple
formula
such
as
Rhythm
is
hypnotic and produces hypera'sthesia*'
or
Metrical patterns
express social norms^'* The significance of rhythm
is
historical
and at any given time depends upon the unfolding of society's
basic contradiction in language*
(b) Poetry
is difficult to translate
It
is recognised as one of the characteristics of poetry that
translations convey
little of the
specific emotion aroused by
that poetry in the original. This can be confirmed by anyone'
who,
after reading a translation, has learned the language of
the original* The metre may be reproduced* What is called the
^^sens.e" may be
exactly
translated*
But
the
specific
poetic
emotion evaporates* Wnere translations are good poetry,
like
FitzGerald's
Ruhdiydt
or
Pope's
Iliads
they
are
virtually
re-creations* The poetic emotion they re-create rarely has much
resemblance to that aroused by the
original*
We
have
no
right
to
attribute
this
to
any
mysterious
transcendent quality in poetry*
It may be so,
or
it may not*
It is a special characteristic of puns* It is a special characteristic
of poetry* No one certainly would claim that the translations
of great novels like War and Peace or The Idiot give to the English
reader all that is in the original* But the extraordinary power of
these works even in translation, when compared to translations
of, say, the Inferno or the Odyssey^ warrants us in claiming that
the
important
aesthetic
qualities
of
the
novel
do
survive
translation
in
a way
that
those
of poetry
cannot*
This
is
certainly
riot due to the difficulty of transferring the formal
metrical pattern* On the contrary—a point often overlooked
much more of the formal metrical pattern of French poetry
can be carried over into an English translation in verse than
can be salvaged of the unstressed spoken rhythm of French
prose
in aa English
prose
translation*
Yet
critics,
anxious

VII
THE CHARACTEHISTICS Ot POETRY
1:2,7
to get some faint flavour of a foreign poet, would far prefer
a literal prose translation to a metrical translation*
(c) Poetry
is irrational
That is not to say that poetry is incoherent or meaningless*
Poetry obeys the rules of grammar, and
is generally capable
of
paraphrase,
the
series
of
propositions
of which
it
consists can be stated in
different prose forms in the same
or other languages. But whereas
the philosophy of Spinoza
remains
the
philosophy
of Spinoza when
explained
by
a
disciple, and a novel of Tolstoi remains a novel of Tolstpi
when
translated,
and
a
fairy* tale
is
the same
fairy
tale by
whomsoever it is
told,
a paraphrase of a poem, though
still
making the same statements as the original,
is no longer the
^ame poem—is probably not a poem at all. By ^Tationaf' we
mean conforming with the orderings men agree upon seeing
in
the environment.
Scientific argument
is
rational
in
this
sense, poetry is not. We have already seen, however, that there
is
another
commonness
or
social
congruence
in
language
distinguishable
from
environmental
congruence.
This
is
emotional^ or subjective congruence. Let us call it '^congruence
with inner reality'L We have also seen that this characteristic
of poetry
is
linked
with
its
rhythmical
form.
Evidently,
therefore,
poetry
is
irrational
as
regards
its
environmental
congruity,
because
it
is
rational
as
regards
its
emotional
congruity and there is a contradiction between these two forms
of congruity. This
contradiction
is not exclusive: they inter-
penetrate in language because they interpenetrate in life. Poetry
is in fact just the expression of one aspect of the contradiction
between man's
emotions and
his
environment, which takes
the vety real and concrete form of man's struggle with Nature.
Because
it is a product of this struggle, poetry at every stage
of its historical development reflects in its own province nian's
active relation to his environment.
Plato referred
to
this special irrationality of poetry in the
quotation already made from Ion. This was what Shelley meant
when he said: "Poetry
is something not subject to the active
powers of the mind".

128
ILLUSION AND REALITY
VII
(d)
Poetry
is composed of voords
This may seem
a commonplace, but nothing
is common-
place
if it
is,
at almost all times and occasions, forgotten by
those who should know
it.
For instance we have Matthew
Arnold: 'Tor poetry the idea is everything; the rest is a world
of illusion, of divine illusion* Poetry attaches
its emotion t6
the idea; the idea is the fact. The strongest part of our religion
to-day
is
its unconscious
poetry,''
We know that the last sentence
distorts a
real
truth. But
the first two are so muddled that it is diJEcult to pick out the
actual meaning, although subsequent chapters will show that
Arnold,
as
a good
craftsman,
was
indicating an important
aspect of poetry.
Shelley uses the same loose speech: "Language, colour, form
and religious and civil habits of actions, are all the instruments
and materials of poetry; they may be
called poetry by
that
figure of speech which considers the
effect
as a synonym of
the cause,"
Beneath the looseness
is the truth that poetry
is produced
by man « real existence in society.
He
also
says: "The
distinction between
poets and
prose
writers
is a vulgar
error.
,
,
,
Plato was
essentially a poet.
Lord Bacon was a poet. ... A poem is the very image of life
expressed in its external truth. ..."
Here
he
talks with
a
looseness which
conceals
nothing.
Bacon was
not
a
poet.
These
overstatements
are
attempts
to
justify
poetry
at
the time when
the sweeping away
of
"idyllic relations" by the development of bourgeois economy
has started to give the poet an inferiority complex.
Mallarm^'s
advice
to
his
painter
friend
is
well
known:
"Poetry
is written with words, not ideas". This adds
to our
own
positive
characteristic
a
negative
one
that we
cannot
endorse. Poetry certainly evokes
ideas^
Le. memory images, or
it would be mere sound. We confine ourselves here therefore
to the proposition: "Poetry
is composed of words".
The reader will see that this characteristic is really generated
by the preceding
characteristic,
"Poetry
is
difficult to trans-
late", For if poetry were written only with ideas,
ue. with the

VII
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF POETRY
llg
aim of stimulating only ideas in the hearer,
it could be trans-
lated by choosing in the other language the words which would
stimulate the same ideas* Since
it cannot, the word
as word
must have some component additional to the idea it stimulates*
Hence we can say poetry
is written with words in a way the
novel
is not, without meaning that a special magic inheres in
the sound-symbol or black mark that objectively is the word*
In fact the word stimulates in addition to the idea an affective
''glow'', of such a character that it cannot be carried over by
translation*
(e) Poetry
is non-symholic
Here we
shall not be accused of a commonplace* On the
contrary,
this
is
the
negative
of ‘a commonplace,
sinte
the
customary
idealistic
conception
of
poetry
is
of something
vaguely symbolic* Yet it necessarily follows from the fact that
poetry is irrational that it is non-symbolic*
What do we mean when we say words are symbolic, that is,
symbols and nothing else? We mean that the words themselves
are nothing, we are not interested in them, but in what they
refer
toi* Thus when a mathematician writes
eight plus nine
equals seventeen^ he
is not interested in the words themselves,
but in the ordering of certain generalised classes encountered
in empirical
reality*
Because the words he makes use of are
symbolic,
that
is, emptied of personal meaning,
the sentence
would have precisely the same validity whatever words were
used* for instance, in French, German or Italian the operations
of ordering
referred
to would
be
precisely
the
same* to
a
mathematician, although described in different words, because
the words themselves are regarded as an arbitrary convention
standing for real mathematical operations of ordering* If the
phrase be translated yito 8 + 9=17, the sentence is still just
as adequate from the mathematician's point of view* Indeed
we can go
farther, and
if to-morrow mathematicians agreed
on a convention whereby 8 was replaced by 9, 9 by 8, and 17
by 23, the plus sign by the minus and the equals by the
is greater
1 There
is
a good
discussion of dbis
referential
character of words

Ogden and Richards, Meaning of Meaning*
I

ILLUSION AND REALITY
VII
130
than, then rihe sentence 9—8^23 would be the precise expres-
sion
of the
empirical
operations
symbolically
expressed by
8-^9= 17. But if to-morrow we decided to abolish all words
and give every word in the English dictionary its own number,
the
poetic
content
of a
speech
of Hamlet would
not
be
expressed by a series of numbers. We should have to translate
them mentally back into the original words before attaining it.
The
extreme
translatability
of the
symbolic
language
9f
mathematics, which has made it possible to evolve a universal
mathematical language,
therefore stands in opposition to the
untranslatability
of
non-symbolic
poetry.
This
universal
mathematical language is logistic or symbolic logic. 1
In so
far
as some of the quality of poetry can be
carried
over into translation, then in so far poetry has an element of
symbdlism in it.
But we also saw that just as poetry, though it was deficient
in
rational
congruence,
was
full
of emotional
congruence,
so, although it lacks external symbolism—^reference to external
objects—^it
is
full of internal symbolism—^reference
to emo-
tional attitudes. Now every real word indicates both an external
referent and a subjective attitude. Hence
scientific argument
contains some value-judgment; it is impossible to eliminate it.
These judgments are eliminated only in logistic. And poetry
contains some reference to external objects—^it
is impossible
to eliminate them and remain poetry.
What does poetry become if all external reference is elimin-
ated, in the way that all value-judgments are eliminated from
a
scientific
argument
to make
it
become
logistic?
Poetry
becomes
^"meaningless’^
sound, but sound
full of emotional
reference—in other words,
music; and music,
like
logistic,
is
translatable and universal. Thus we see that the mingling of
reference and emotion, which is characteristic of poetry,
is not
an adulteration, but expresses a dialectic relation between the
opposite poles of instinct and environment, a relation which is
rooted in real concrete social life—English, French or Athenian.
Poetry
is clotted social history, the emotional sweat of man s
struggle with Nature.

THE CHARACTERISTICS OF POETRY
I3I
(f) Poetry
is concrete
This
is a positive that matches the previous negative state-
ment* But concreteness is not the automatic converse of symbol-
ism* For instance, a symbolic language may approach nearer to
the concrete by rejecting the general for the particular* Arith-
metic is more concrete than algebra, because its symbols are less
generalised* A mathematic symbolism in which
the symbol
two stood only for two bricks, and other symbols were needed
for two horses, two men,
etc*, would plainly be more concrete
than existing mathematical symbolism, but
it would not be
less symbolic, for it would be still as conventional" and suscept-
ible
to arbitrary sign substitution* But it would be plain that
as a symbolic language becomes more concrete, it becomes more
and more
cumbersome*
Since no two men
are
the
same,
diflFerent symbols would be needed for each possible pairing
of men in a perfectly concrete symbolic language*
The
generality of mathematics
is
a
generality of external
reality;
hence
the
particularity
of mathematics would
also
be a particularity of external
reality, and since the number
of objects in external reality is infinite, mathematics must be
generalised* It is the most flexible tool for dealing with outer
reality because it
is the most generalised; Since
it
is dealing
with orderings only,
i*e* with classes, it can subdue the infinite
particularity of the universe*
It
is no
accident
that
infinity
appears so often in mathematics*
Compare poetry*
Its province
is subjective
attitudes* Now
the
conscious
field
consists
of
real
objects
and
subjective
attitudes towards them* By ordering these real objects in the
most
general way,
mathematics
arrives
at
infinity,
a
single
symbol which puts
all
external
reality in
its
grasp* But
if
poetry orders all these subjective attitudes in the most general-
ised way,
it arrives at the
e^o, a single symbol which puts
all
subjective reality in its grasp*
In
fact
it
is music,
not poetry, which
is
as
abstract and
generalised
in
regard
to
subjective
reality
as
mathematics
is to external
reality* In music the environment sinks away,
the ego inflates, and all the drama takes place within its walls*
Mathematics
is
externally
abstract
and
generalised;* music
internally so*

I3Z
ILLUSION AND REALITY
VII
But poetry
is like scientific argument,
it
is
''impure’’*
Its
emotions
are attached
to
real objects and
this
gives them a
certain
peculiarity*
Reality
hovers
in the
ego’s
vision. This
means
that
poetry
is
concrete
and
particularised,
just
as
scientific argument
is concrete and particularised, although of
course
in
each
case
the
concretion and
generality
refers
to
different spheres of reality*
For example, when the poet says
My love is like a red, red rose,
the language
is non-symbolic, for no conventional acceptation
will make the paraphrase, "my fiancee is a flower of the genus
rosacea
var*
red”,
a statement containing the poetic emotion
expressed in the original statement* The line
is non-symbolic*
It is not therefore to be supposed that it must be concrete. But
if it were not concrete, the statement would be in its present
form quite generally true. That is to say,
if it were abstract,
it would not be a specific case, a statement appropriate to the
poet, to a particular love, to one mood,
to one time, to one
poem,
but a quite
general statement,
so
that wherever
the
speaker is in a position to make the statement "my love is”, he
must inevitably have in mind,
as an already given fact, that
she is "like a red, red rose”.
But since poetry is not abstract, but a concrete non-symbolic
*
language, we are entitled, in the next poem we write, to say
or
My love is a white, white rose*
If flowers be blossoms, my love is no rose.
But with an abstract non-symbolic language we would only
be entitled to make this statement in a body of poetry other
than the one in which we made the
first,
that
is to
say,
in
another language* A misunderstanding of
this
point makes
Plato regard all poets as liars: and an understanding of it makes
Sidney able to answer him by explaining that the poet "is no
lyar, for he nothing affirms”.

.VII
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF POETRY
I33
Thus this concrete character of poetry^s subjective generalisa-
tion
is just what makes
it necessary to give poetry the half-
assent of illusion—^to accept its statements while we are in its
phantastic world but not to demand that all the statements of
all novels and poems should form one world in which the
principles of exclusion and contradiction would apply, as they
do
in the
real material world* This does not mean that no
integration
is
necessary
as between novels and poems* That
integration is the very province of aesthetics* It is the essential
task of aesthetics to rank Herrick below Milton, and Shakes-
peare above either, and explain in rich and complex detail why
and how they
differ* But such an act implies a standard, an
integrated world view, which
is not scientific
Le. rational
but aesthetic* This is the logic of art*
This concretion and particularity applies also to the sphere
of scientific argument, which,
like poetry,
is impure but
is
nearer the opposite pole* Everyone knows that biology, physics,
sociology and psychology are spheres in each of which different
laws
apply,
although
there
is
a
connecting
principle which
states that the law applicable to the more generalised sphere
must not be contradicted in any less generalised sphere,
^*^* the
laws of sociology must not contradict those of physics* In the
same way poetry must have this congruence,
that its experi-
ences always happen to the same
in whatever phantastic
world, and novels must have this congruence, that they always
have their scene laid in the same real world of human society
whatever the *T' (character) may be; and the structure of this
emotional
or real world determines the aesthetic judgment*
This ego is in fact the
^ Vorld-view'" in which a logic of art is
already given*
Does this
* impurity'* mean that neither science nor poetry
are ‘Teally'^ true? On the contrary* Because truth can only apply
to reality, to real concrete life, and because real concrete life is
neither wholly subjective nor wholly objective but a dialectic
active relation between the two (man's struggle with Nature),
it is only these ''impure" products of the struggle to which we
can at all apply the criterion "true"* Truth always has a social
human reference—it means "true" in relation to man* Hence
the
criterion of mathematics,
as
Russell has pointed
out,
is

ILLUSION AND REALITY
VII
134
never
truth" ^ it is consistency* In the same way the criterion
of music is '"beauty""* The fact that language in all its products
contains a blend of both is because man in his real life is always
actively striving to fulfil Keats" forecasts:
Beauty
is truth,
truth beauty;
he
is
always
struggling
to make
environment
conform
to
instinct,
consistency to beauty, and necessity to
desire—in a
word,
to be
free* Language
is
the product of that struggle
because
it
is
the
struggle not of one man but of men
in
association
and
language
is
the
instrument
of
associated
struggle; hence language is stamped everywhere with humanity
as well as with man"s environment* Just as science is near the
environmental pole, so poetry is near the instinctive* Consist-
ency is the virtue of science, beauty of poetry—neither can ever
become pure beauty or pure consistency, and yet
it
is
their
struggle
to achieve
this which
drives on their development*
Science yearns
always
towards
mathematics,
poetry towards
music*
(g) Poetry
is characterised hy condensed ejects
These
affects
are the
affects proper
to
it,
that
is
to
say,
aesthetic aflFects* A telegram, "Your wife died yesterday"", may
impart
extraordinarily condensed
aflFects
to the reader of
it,
but these are not of course aesthetic aflFects. Here the language
is used symbolically, and if the unhappy husband who received
this telegram had previously known that his wife was in danger
and (being of a parsimonious turn of mind) had arranged for the
code word "Kippers"" to be despatched to him as an indication
of his wife"s death, the affects accompanying the shorter mes-
sage would be just as strong* This would be just as true even
if the telegram were formally poetic* The scraps of doggerel in
The
Times obituary column have the formal characteristics of
poetry and carry strong affects for those who insert them; but
these affects are not aesthetic aflFects*
Now in both these cases another test could be applied* To
other persons not bereaved, the words could not carry the same
affects* The non-aesthetic affects are individual not collective,

THE CHARACTERISTICS OF POETRY
I35
and depend on particular not social experiences* Therefore it is
not enough
that poetry should be
charged with
emotional
significance if this emotion results from a particular personal
experience
unrealisable
or
unrealised
in
a
social form* The
emotion must be generated by the experience of associated men,
and we now see of what the generality of the poetic
con-
sists*
It
is not the
of one individual in civil society, any
more than the
infinity of mathematics
is the infinity of one
personas perceptual world* The infinity of mathematics
is the
infinity of the material world—of the world common to
all
men^s perceptual worlds* And the
of poetry
is the
common to all associated men's emotional worlds* How could
bourgeois ‘criticism, which never rises above the point of view
of the '‘individual in civil society", solve the problem of what
differentiates ' aesthetic
objects
and
emotions
from
others?
Aesthetic objects are aesthetic in so far as they arouse emotions
peculiar not to individual man but to associated men* From
this arises the disinterested, suspended and objective character
of aesthetic emotion*
To
summarise:
poetry
is
rhythmical,
not
translatable,
irrational,
non-symbolic,
concrete,
and
characterised
by
condensed aesthetic affects*
These characteristics will suffice to det^ach the body of poetry
from literature as a whole, and we can now proceed to a closer
examination of its method,
its technique,
its function and its
future*

VIII
THE WORLD AND THE 'T*
1
The characteristics of poetry flow necessarily from the nature
of language and the active function of poetry in relation to
society^ man and reality.
When we speak of ‘^man*" we mean the genotype or indi-
vidual,
the
instinctive man
as he
is
born, who
if
^left
to
himself^
^ might grow up into something like a dumb brute,
but instead of this he grows up in a certain kind of society as
a
certain kind
of man—^Athenian,
Aztec
or
Londoner. We
must not think
of the genotype
as
completely
plastic and
amorphous.
It has certain definite instincts and potentialities
which are the source of its energy and its restlessness. Nor are
all genotypes alike. Men differ among themselves because of
inborn characteristics. Society is not, however, opposed to this
inborn individuality; on the contrary, the differentiation which
comes with
increase of civilisation
is the means of realising
men^s
particularities. Man cannot
choose between being an
artist
or
a
scientist
in
a
society which has
neither
art nor
science; nor between biology and psychology where science
is
still no more than vague astrological superstition.
This genotype
is never found
''in the raw^\ Always
it
is
found as a man of definite concrete civilisation with definite
opinions, material surroundings, and education—a man with a
consciousness conditioned by the relations he has entered into
with other men and which he did not choose but was born into.
Men were
originally drawn
into
these
relations by
their
struggle with Nature or outer reality. There are certain laws of
the
individual—^physiological and
psychological.
But
in
the
extent to which man as one part of reality has separated him-
self from the other part (Nature) not in order to cut himself
from it, but to struggle with it and thereby interpenetrate with
it more closely in economic production—to that extent man

Vin
THE WORLD AND THE
''l'*
137
has generated yet another field of laws, those of sociology* None
of these sets of laws contradicts each other; they enrich each
other*
But it
is obvious that the field of sociology holds a special
place because it is the field of the interpenetration of man and
Nature, and the source of the generation ideologically of the
other laws*
The struggle of man and Nature
is
a material movement
which in the field of thought takes the form of the subject-
object relation, the oldest problem of philosophy* It becomes
an insoluble problem only because the division of society into
classes, by separating the class which generates ideology from
society’s active struggle with Nature, reflects this cleavage into
ideology as a separation of subject from object whereby they
become mutually exclusive opposites*
In the field of thought as a whole this struggle of man and
Nature in society
is
reflected as reality or ‘‘truth”* This truth
or reality is not something dropped down from on high, it is a
living, growing, developing complext Because it is truth about
the Universe,
it
is a truth about matter* When we say the
Universe
is material we mean that all phenomena have under-
ground
connections,
in
the form
of
causes
or determining
relations, which have an ultimate homogeneity called “matter”*
This is the first assumption of science, because to include any-
thing in the field of science
is to assert it has connections of
this kind* To deny such connectedness of any phenomena is to
deny their knowability and therefore the possibility of their
inclusion in the field of science* The Jiistory of science
is the
discovery
of these
connections,
and
their
demonstration
as
objective* They cannot be discovered by contemplation alone,
but at every stage experiment—the practical demonstration of
connections—^is necessary*
Thus truth
is an organised product of man’s struggle with
Nature* As that struggle accumulates
capital (technique and
knowledge) and grows in complexity, so the truth which is the
reflection of reality blossoms in man’s head* Only a partial
aspect of that truth, at any time, can be in any one man’s head*.
Distorted, partial and limited, in one head, this perception of
reality yet acquires the power of truth, of science^ in the heads

138
ILLUSION AND REALITY
VIII
of all living men, because it is organised by the conditions of
society
which
themselves
spring
from
the
necessities
of
economic production* Thus
at any time truth
is the special
complex formed by
the
partial
reflections
of reality
in
all
living men's heads—not as a mere lumping together, but as
these views
are organised in a given
society, by
its
level of
experimental
technique,
scientific
literature, means of com-
munication and discussion, and laboratory facilities*
In each man ‘'truth" takes the form of perception—^what he
seizes of reality with his senses—^and memory—^what
is active
at any moment of former perception, aflFecting his present per-
ception* Because these human consciousnesses acquire tremen-
dous power when their contents emerge organised by associa-
tion, and become truth, they reflect back again with increasing
penetration on the individual, whose memory and perception
thus become more and more modified by being in society* An
individual's consciousness
is, in this sense, a social product*
Truth is individual man's experience of the connections of
phenomena, become organised by homologation with millions
of other such experiences*
It can be organised because these
perceptual worlds
are
all phenomena
exhibited by
the one
material universe of which all individuals are a part, and not
phenomena of so many private subjective Universes* Without
this common factor, there would be no congruence of private
worlds and
therefore no
objective
truth*
Science,
which
is
objective truth, therefore is concerned with demonstrating the
material connections or “causality" of phenomena*
There is no absolute truth, but there is a limit to which the
truth of society at any monient continually aims* This limit
of absolute truth is *the Universe itself. When man shall have
completely interpenetrated with Nature
*
*
, Yet even
this
theoretical limit supposes both a Universe that stands still and
a truth which
is outside the Universe* Truth, however,
is a
part of the Universe* Yet truth is generated By man's struggle
with the
rest of reality, and hence, with each stage of the
struggle, new reality
is generated and the world made more
complex* As a result reality itself is enriched, and the goal-post
of “absolute truth" removed
a
stage
further by
that
very
increase
in
the complexity of
reality*
Society can no more

VIII
THE WORLD AND THE
''l''
139
reach absolute truth than a man can be tall enough to look down
on himself—yet just as man's height by continually increasing
extends his range of view, so society's development endlessly
extends its truth*
Language is the most flexible instrument man has evolved in
his associated struggle with Nature* Alone, man cannot plough
Nature deeply; hence alone he cannot know her deeply* But as
associated man, master of economic production, he widens his
active influence on her, and therefore enlarges the truth which
is‘ the product of that action* Language is the essential tool of
human
association*
It
is for
this reason that one can hardly
think of truth except as a statement in language, so much
is
truth the product of association.
How does truth emerge in language? The word is a gesture,
a cry. Take, for example, a herd of beasts that give a certain
cry in situations of danger* When one
cries, the others,
as a
result of a current of primitive passive sympathy, are terrified
too, and all flee together*
The cry therefore has a subjective side, a ^Teeling~tone", all
jtd terrified at the cry*
But the
cry
also
indicates some
thing
terrifying,
a foe
or
danger* The cry therefore has an objective side,
a
reference to
something perceivable in reality*
Evidently
for
purely
animal
existence
a
few
brief
cries
suffice* Some animals are dumb* But for the animal engaged
in
economic
production
in
association—the
animal
called
man—the cry becomes the word. Its ^Value"
is now no longer
instinctive—^resulting from the relation of genotype to habitual
environment—it
becomes
^ ^arbitrary"—^resulting
from
the
relation
of modified
genotype
to
artificial
environment
in
economic production* In becoming the word
as
a
result of
association
for economic production,
the
cry
still retains its
two
sides,
its
instinctive
feeling-tone and
its
acquired
per-
ceptual value, but both are made more precise and complex*
The feelings of the herd have a general similarity, because
of the similarity of their instinctive make-up* Their percep-
tions also have a similarity, because of the likeness in their
way
of
living*
These
like
feelings
are
not known
to
the
individual
animals
as
like,
any more than
each knows
the

140
ILLUSION AND REALITY
VIII
other^s percefptual worlds are like* The individual animal feels
and sees
alone. We, the onlookers, deduce the likeness in the
emotional and
perceptual
worlds
of the
animals from
the
similarity
of
their
behaviour;
but
the
animals
cannot
be
conscious in this way of a like world*
Man knom that there
is a likeness in the worlds of men;
this likeness
is expressed for example in science, the world of
perceptual
reality*
In
the same way
he knows
there
is
a
likeness in feelings* This likeness is expressed in art, the world
of affective reality*
Man
only came
to know
this
likeness
in
his
perceptual
worlds when he entered into association with other men* Why
did he
so
enter?
In
order
to change
his perceptual world*
This contradiction is simply the basic contradiction of science
—that man learns about reality in changing
it* That
is pre-
cisely what an experiment does; and the experiment is crucial
for science* This
characteristic contradiction reaches
its 6nal
expression in Heisenberg's Principle of Indeterminacy, which
declares
that
all knowledge of reality
involves
a change
in
reality* All laws of science are laws stating what actions produce
what changes in reality* Science is the sum of the changes in
perceptual worlds produced by men in their history, preserved,
organised, made handy, compendious and penetrating*
In the same way, man learns of the likeness of the
egos
of other men by attempting to change them* This change
is
essential
for living in
association
as men* Man's
instinct
is
to do always such and such* Unless therefore these
instincts
can be modified to make him do something different, man
will respond instinctively instead of in a conditioned way,, and
society will be impossible* Men
live
in
a common
feeling-
world only in so far as they'are able to produce changes in each
other's feelings by action* This change in feeling is crucial for
art* The sum of such changes, organised and made independent
of men,
is what art
is, not in
abstraction, but emerging in
concrete living*
Both science and
art
exist nascently
in
the
animal* The
wooing of the female, the frightening of enemies, mean that
the
active
animal must
change
feeling
in
the
other* The
courtship dance and the threatening preliminaries
to a fight

vin
THE WORLD AND THE

I4I
are art in embryo* But both are done instinctively* They lack
freedom and are therefore unconscious* They do not belong to
a
socially conditioned world. Only those feelings which are
changed by means not given explicitly in the nature of man or
of the natural environment are the subject of art* In so far as
art exposes the real necessity of the instincts by exposing all
the various possible changes following from the various possible
means
of
influencing
them,
art
becomes
conscious
of the
necessity of the world of feeling, and therefore free* Art is the
expression of man's freedom in the world of feeling,
just as
science
is
the expression of man's freedom in the world of
sensory perception, because both are conscious of the necessities
of their worlds and can change them—^art the world of feeling
or
inner
reality,
science
the world of phenomena
or
outer
reality*
The common
flight
of
a
herd from
a
terrifying
object
indicated by the
cry of one,
is science in embryo, but only
becomes science when
it
is the consciousness of a change in
the perceptual world produced,
not by
fleeing from danger
instinctively, but by altering it economically—^by, for example,
making weapons or a snare and killing the dangerous animal,
or retreating in an organised way, covering the rear*
Science and art, although expressions of the social common-
ness in perceptual and feeling worlds, do not reduce men to
replicas of each other* On the contrary, because they deal with
possible changes
i
and are expanded and enriched in proportion
as new changes
are discovered,
they are the means whereby
individual
differences
are
realised*
Differences which
at the
animal level reveal themselves as a hare-lip or an extra plump-
ness, now appear
as subtle
differences of emotional
life
or
Weltanschauung, colouring and enriching the whole complex of
reality* Language is the special medium whereby these changes
are made social coin* Words are the money of the ideological
market
of mankind*
Even
as’ a few
exchange
transactions
express all the bewildering complexity of modern social being,
so a few sounds express
all the rich universe of emotion and
truth which
is modern man's ideological world*

142
ILLUSION AND REALITY

Let us study the Word* Just as that simple thing, a pound
note, reveals a staggering intricacy when we pursue its reflection
in the spheres of value and price, supply and demand,
profit
and cost,
so the word is a microcosm of a whole universe of
ideological elaboration*
The word has
a subjective side
(feeling) and an objective
side (perception)* But these do not exist in the word-as-itself,
in contemplation, any more than a pound note exists in itself
as paper and print* They exist only in the word as a dynamic
social act, just as a pound note only exists in exchange*
The word is spoken and heard* Let us call the parties to this
act speaker and hearer* The word indicates some portion of
reality sensorily perceptible:
this
is
its symbolic or referential
context* The speaker wishes to change the hearer^s perceptual
world
so
as
to include the thing the word symbolises*
For
example, he may say,
^^Look,
a rosef
^ He wishes the hearer
to see a rose, or be aware of the possibility of seeing one* Or
he may say, ^^Some roses are blue*^* in which case he wishes
to modify
the
hearer s
perceptual world
to
the
extent
of
including blue roses* And so on up to the most elaborate and
abstruse mathematical discourse*
But in order to do this, there must be a Common Perceptual
World—common to both speaker and hearer—^with Common
Perceptual 'Symbols—^symbols -for indicating
entities
in that
common world which are accepted as current by both speaker
and hearer*
This Common Perceptual World is the* world of reality or
truth,
and
science
is
its most general
expression* We have
already seen how it was built up by men's experience of chang-
ing reality* If is sometimes described as the world of’percepts
or concepts (the distinction
is
artificial)* Because ^Tlue" and
^^rose" are common to this world, the speaker can change the
hearer's perceptual world by the injection of a blue rose into it*
Blue and rose are now combined and make a new entity—one
which was not before in*the Common Perceptual World, but
now colour each other in a whole which is more than the sum
of the parts*

VIII
THE WORLD AND THE
'‘l’*
I43
What, then, has been the result of the transaction? A blue
rose, which was in the speaker s perceptual world, but not in
their common
perceptual world
or
in
the
hearer s perceptual
world, has been formed in the common perceptual world and
introjected
into
the
hearer's
perceptual
world* Hence both
the
hearer's
perceptual' world and
the dommon
perceptual
world are changed* Thus,
if now the speaker says,
blue
rose
is scentless", the sentence will have a meaning it would
not have had
before,
because
blue
roses now
exist
in
the
common perceptual world of speaker and hearer*
Notice that a new word is not essential to introduce a new
entity to the common perceptual world, although
it
is some-
times used* We might have. said,
is a blue rose", ^^N
is
scentless"* Most new entires are introduced by recombination,
expansion, condensation and displacement of existing symbols
rather than by neologism*
But the transaction does not change only the hearer's per-
ceptual world and the common perceptual world* For, in order
to body forth his unique individual experience of a strange
blossom to the hearer,
the speaker had to transform
it into
current
coin* From a unique blossom,
unlike anything seen
before or
since,
it had to become for him a blue rose—as a
blossom, belonging to the order
rose;
as a visual rose,
to the
colour
blue.
Thus
the
act
of communication
changed
his
experience and as it were kept it on the social rails, just as it
changed
the common
perceptual world and
the
perceptual
world of his hearer*
But it would be inverting the process to suppose that the
^ common world cheapens our impressions by making unique
individual
experiences
conceptual and
trite* We respond
to
experience with broad instinctive drives, which divide experience
'into ^^edible", ".non-edible", "dangerous", "neutral", "light",
' "dark"* The possession of the common world of experience
enables us to discriminate flowers among the non-edible, roses
among flowers, colours among lightness, blue^among colours*
Objective reality thus separates itself out by social means from
a vague humming
chaos on the threshold of consciousness*
The more complex our social world, the more the individual
phenomenon becomes an intersection of a number of concepts

144
ILLUSION AND REALITY

and therefore the more
individual and unique
it
is*
Once
again we must repeat:
society
is the means of realising
in-
dividuality
and
therefore
the
road
of
freedom*
Keeping
the
perception
on
the
social
rails
is
merely
keeping
it
conscious*
This change in the perceptual worlds of speaker and hearer
and
in the common perceptual
' world,
is the essence of the
Word* The
lightest
" word produces such
a
change,
however
trifling* We measure the power of the word by the degree of
the change*
The word
is not fully realised except as
a dynamic
social
act* We overlook this just as we overlook that a pound note
only exists importantly as a social act, because the complexities
produced by the division of labour delay the impact between
producer and consumer by the interposition of a market* The
pound note,
like a word,
is only the expression of a transfer
between one man and another—of goods in one case, of ideas
in another—^but the conditions of commodity-production give
them a mysterious existence in their own right as concepts
the concept of ^Value^^ in the one case, the concept of 5^mean-
ing*^ in the other*
We must
therefore
picture mens
heads
as
full
of these
private perceptual worlds and then certain percepts in common
(or
concepts) which form a common perceptual world,
and
therefore
give them
the means
of modifying
each
other^s
private worlds* Truth is not just the lump-sum of all private
worlds;
it
is
the common world—the means whereby
these
private worlds modify each other* These private worlds have
relations with each other just as do the men who bear them
"
in their heads* This plexus of relations is Truth*
But neither truth nor perception
exist
as a self-contained
superstructure*
They
only
exist
as
reflections
oif
material
changes* The common perceptual world contains both truth
and
error*
True
or
false means
just
this:
‘‘Living
in
the
commdn
perceptual
world^'* Truth only
separates out from
falsehood by
the
active
relation of the common
perceptual
world with material reality*
We saw that man's interaction with Nature was continu-
ously enriched by economic production* Economic production

VIII
THE WORLD AND THE
''l'"
145
requires association which in turn demands the word* For men
to work together, that 'is, to operate together non-instinctively,
they must
have
a common
world
of
changeable
perceptual
reality, and by changeable I mean changeable by their actions;
and
by
changeable
by
their
actions
I
include
predictable
change, such as dawn and eclipse, and locatable change, such
as
*'here'^ and
there' \ for man's control over himself makes
it possible for him to be at such-and-such a place by night, for
example, and
so in
effect change
reality by his actions
as a
result
of simple perceptual
discrimination
of sequence and
location* Hence, by means of the word, men's association in
economic production
continually
generates
changes
in
their
perceptual private worlds and 'the common world,
enriching
both* A
vast moving superstructure
rises above man's busy
hands which is the reflection of all the change he has effected
or
discovered
in
ages of
life.
Presently
this common world
-becomes
as complex and remote from* concrete social
life as
the market,
of which
its
secret
life and unknown
creative
forces are the counterpart.
This is the shadow world of thought, or ideology* It is the
reflection in men's heads of the real world.
It
is always and
necessarily only symbolical of the real world* It is always and
necessarily a
reflection which
has an
active and
significant
relation to the object, and it
is this activity and significance,
and not the projective qualities of the reflection, which guar-
antee its truth* Every part of the Universe projectively reflects
the remainder; only man is conscious of his environment. The
idea
is not the thing: the reflection is not the object; but one
expresses or reflects the other. The words are tied to percepts
which are photographic memory-images of bits of reality* These
percepts are fused into concepts, are organised and ordered in
the broadest and most abstract way* Or, more accurately, out
of the
broad, humming chaos
of
"existence"—the simplest
percept—other concepts and percepts
arise by differentiation
and integration* All
this phantasmagoria
is accepted by man
as only symbolic, just as a remembered percept
is accepted as
symbolic* When man recalls a certain mrse or dwells on the
concept ""horse",
in neither case does he suppose a horse
is
act;ually in
his head. Even when’ he
dwells
on
the
refined
K

146
ILLUSION AND REALITY
VIII
concept
he still does not suppose all two things are in
his head or that his head is double*
The word
refers
to
this shadow world
of thought,
and
conjures up
portions
of
it in
a man s
head* The Common
Perceptual World, with
all
the
condensations,
organisations
and displacements
it has undergone,
refers to and symbolises
outer
reality*
It
is
all the percepts of reality mobilised
for
action* It is a compendium of what happens to percepts when
the underlying reality
is affected* The word symbolises
this
shadow world which it has helped to create, and is therefore
the symbol of a symbol*
*
This
is the sphere of truth and error* The word expresses a
social convergence of action*
"'X
is
here*"'" This
is true
if a
number of people
arrive
in practice
^^here''
simultaneously*
is blue'*
is true if there
is a general similarity in society's
reaction to S as a result of the message (for example, in com-
paring it with an already agreed colour on a chart)* Of course*
we do not always refer to the concrete living of society—the
Common Perceptual World is so organised as to make refer-
ence to it alone sufScient in most cases (logic, laws,
records)*
But if there is any difference not solvable by recourse to this
shadow world (contradiction between a hypothesis and experi-
ence) it can only be settled by a recourse to material reality (the
crucial experiment) whereby the common perceptual world
is
changed (new hypothesis)* In this way the shadow world is in
organic connection with material reality and continually sucks
life and
growth from
its
contradiction* The
contradiction
between theory and practice is what urges on both* Only their
organic
unity
enables them
to
contradict
each
other:
False
cannot contradict
hot because they live in
different spheres:
they are not one* False is contradicted by truey hot by colL Truth
and
error cannot
rest within the framework of the shadow
world; their resolution -demands recourse to the real material
world* Any dispute which remains within the confines of the
shadow world is not a dispute about truth and error but about
consistency* The whole use of this world
is to be
a
correct
and compendious reflection of material reality; not merely a
still reflection but a djmamic one*

THE WORLD AND'THE
''l''

But now we must summon into being another world,
also
lying behind the word—the world of feeling—the ego. Just as
the cry was connected not only with something outside and
terrifying but also with some state inside, the being terrified,
*
so all words, besides indicating some outer entity, include also
an inner
attitude towards
that
entity.
Brutes^
animals^
leasts^
living organisms^
are words
all indicating similar real
entities,
but each with a different group of feeling-tones.
It may be asked: Why not have
a different word for the
feeling-tone,
another
for
the
object,
and
so
increase
the
plasticity of language and facilitate clarity? The answer is: it is
not in the nature or possibility of experience; for the separation
between feeling-tone and real object is an abstraction. In reality
they are
one^—^part of the one active subject-object relation.
We may
separate the conscious
field into
real
(or objective)
qualities
and
apparent
(or
subjective
qualities),
but
the
separation is artificial.
Mechanical
materialism,
for
example,
started
from
the
position
that
only
those
qualities
are
real
into which
the
observer does not enter. Thus,
first the world was stripped of
colour, feeling, scent and temperature, for these could easily be
demonstrated to have a neural component. Einstein advanced
this a stage further by demonstrating the dependence of size,
weight, duration and motion on the observer—these too were
therefore eliminated and only the tensor was left invariant; but
the development of quantum mechanics impugned even this
and nothing invariant was left but a probability ^Vave*^
i.e.
a
mathematical
function.
Hence
the
search
for
complete
objectivity only leaves us with a bunch of equations—that
is,
of thoughts.
Mechanical materialism turns into its opposite
solipsism.
But the
idealist^s programme
is just as disastrous. Starting
from the opposite programme,
**All is mind that has nothing
material about it'^ he is driven to exclude everything but the
absolute Idea or concept. But a concept is ^^something^^ in a
human brain, and a human brainds matter. Thus the idealist is
left with nothing but material human brains. Or if he denies

148
ILLUSION AND REALITY
VIII
that concepts are dependent on human brains^ he is an absolute
idealist, and his world is made up of real things
j
ideas existing
objectively apart from men*
This
dualistic see-saw
is inevitable as long as the concrete
genesis of experience is ignored—its active subject-object rela-
tion—^man's struggle with Nature* For in every given experi-
ence
there
is
a
like and an
unlike,
i.e*
something given
in
previous experience, and something not given* The something
already encountered
is the
object,
the something new
is the
having of the experience—that which makes us able to differen-
tiate this object or this encounter with the object from others*
For example, we may pass the same rose every day, but the
^
'setting"^ of the day is different, and therefore our attitude to
the
rose* That newness
or
difference
is,
in
that
particular
experience, our subjective attitude to the rose—the 'Teeling-
tone** of that experience* Of course there
is
also something
located ^^out there'^ which accounts for the feeling of newness.
And there is in our experience, in the subjective side of it, also
^Recognition'', recognition of the rose as a flower, as an object,
as something real*
This
^Reeling-tone!'
inheres in
all experience:
there
is the
reality, the objective sector of the conscious field on the one
hand, and on the other hand the subjective attitude towards it*
One is the field of the ^T", the other the field of the Universe*
We may say that every real object has as a result of our experi-
ence subjective associations adhering to
it, but of course these
are not attached mechanically, but depend on the
setting
internal and
external* A
rose
in
one
setting
has
different
associations from a rose in another*
This in its most general form is the law of the conditioned
response, the law that fluid reality is classified by the instinctive
responses, and that these
classes
elaborate,
shift and change
according to experience*
The simplest form of this instinctive classification of external
reality is of course numerical—mathematics* The most elemen-
tary act of self-consciousness
is that which separates the 'T"
from Nature, and this ^recognition of separation,» of discon-
tinuity, when sympathetically introjected into objects, makes
possible the conception of numerous things* Thus mathematics

VIII
THE WORLD AND THE
''l''
149
is that order of experience in which the subjective content is
almost
nil,
so
primitive
is
it*
It
is not correct
to speak of
mathematics as bare of quality, for already we have the differ-
ence between the qualities of the numbers, in itself a reflection
of the difference between
and other* But it is almost bare
of quality, and for that reason,
as we have already noted, the
language of mathematics
is most purely symbolic* But since it
is based on the most fundamental part of self-consciousness it
seems the least objective and most ^^ideal"^ of the sciences*
Since
all
other
language,
however
rigidly
objective
and
symbolic, necessarily deals with categories of quality, since in
fact the sphere of any given science is defined by the particular
qualities
with
which
it
is
concerned,
all
other
language
^
necessarily contains varying amounts of feeling-tone—of that
subjective essence of experience which is part of '"quality^^
.
Quality can only be apprehended and distinguished subjec-
tively* But directly it is no longer new and has become a social
fact,
it can
be
established objectively and is drawn into the
sphere of quantity* Thus, once we have recognised socially the
colour blue,
it c^ be associated with a certain wave-length,
and becomes
an
objective
fact*
It
can then be
considered
objectively* But from its first appearance as something strange
and unique to its last vanishing as a mere figure on a dial,
it
retains some element of the subjective*
This shift of subjective experience into the more objective
sphere
is important because
it enables us to understand how
feeling-tone can never be completely separated from the object
in experience—and dierefore in the word—and how we can yet
have
words
for
feelings
only
e.g.
^^afraid'',
'Tear'\
But
‘^afraid'* and ^Tear^^ indicate here objective realities* The mind
can introspect and then watch other people, so that its feelings,
projected
into
the
social
world, become
objective,
become
objects of contemplation for it* In the experience indicated by
'^afraid'', we have both the subjective state it objectively refers
to, and the subjective feeling-tone in thinking of people being
afraid*
Thus
experience weaves back and
forth on
itself,
always
modified "by
its
settings,
always
generating
fresh
tones and
complexes and yet, in so far as
it
is activised by the Word,

ILLUSION AND REALITY
VIII
150
always
symbolic
of
external
reality
and
internal
feeling*
Just as the word refers to a portion of objective reality,
Le.
is the stimulus for the idea of it, so
it is the stimulus for a
portion of feeling-tone* 1 Due to the limitations of vocabulary,
any given word
is in fact the potential stimulus for a whole
series of possible classes, entities or movements in outer reality
—for example, the word ^^sea^^ By combination grammatically
with other words, however, only part of these meanings
are
released—it is seen to refer only to the sea, or to sea in certain
conditions* The same selection applies to the possible feeling
associations of a word, not all of which are generated at any
time*
We saw
that we were
able
to communicate part of our
experience of outer reality to others because of the existence of
a common perceptual world with agr(!ed symbols* In the same
way, we communicate
our
feelings
to
others
because
of
a
common
feeling world with
agreed symbols* This common
perceptual world was nothing but the
world, or truth
as^ reflected in the consciousness of society* What, then,
is the
common
affective
world?
This common
affective
world
is
nothing but the
which men construct as a result of their
social experience*
We know the dilemma of the critical idealist, who cannot
know what matter
is like in itself and so denies matter, and
of his opposite the behaviourist, who cannot know how other
men are for themselves and so denies consciousness* Now the
idealist is refuted by practice, by showing that matter can be
made to exhibit certain phenomena by certain operations, and
when all these possibilities of change have been explored the
thing-in-itself becomes a thing-for-us* In the same way,
the
behaviourist is refuted by practice, by our relations with our
fellow men,
in which we count on
their having instinctual
1 The distinction between the ajffective and rational significance of words
is of course an old one. Hindoo philosophy recognised the
‘^dhvana'^ or
hidden meaning of words as
characteristic of poetry. Dante distinguished
between signum rationale and signum sensuale, which in turn was based on a
division recognised by William of Occam. Milton*s well-known definition
of poetry as simple, sensuous, and passionate was no doubt influenced by this
conception* Ogden's and Richards' analysis of meaning is based on a distinc-
tion between the symbolic and emotive meaning of words.

I5I
drives
like
ourselves,
leading to like
actions, and
'^feel our-
selves^^ into them sympathetically, so that their consciousness-
of-themselves becomes behaviour-for-us*
The common lives of men in association—far more powerful
than the
life experience of one individual—^have summarised
symbolically a whole range of transactions with outer reality,
which are thus
accessible to each and constitute the known
Universe* In the same way associated man has amassed a whole
world of affective experience which is thus easily accessible and
constitutes the common ego or Mind*i Now a civilised man s
view of outer reality is almost entirely built up of the common
perceptual
world:
he
sees
the
sun- as
a
fiery
star,
cows
as
animals, iron as metal, and so on* The extraordinary'power and
universality of language guarantees this* But it
is just as true
that
his
whole
emotional
consciousness,
his whole
feeling-
attitude to the sun, iron, cows and so forth,
is almost entirely
built up from the common ego which enables us to live in close
relation as men*
Once again we must emphasise that neither the common
perceptual world nor the common ego makes men think or feel
in a standardised way* On the contrary, they are the very means
whereby man realises his individual differences* To members
of an animal species, the world looks very much alike because
it is such a simple world: their lives cannot differ much within
a narrow range* To a human being bom in a highly civilised
society, the world is so complex and elaborate that his life can
be unique—completely realisable of his genetic individuality*
In
the same way,
animals of one
species must have a very
similar emotional
life:
their
emotional world
is
so
simple*
But the social ego has been so*subtilised and refined by gener-
ations of
art and
experience,
that an
individual
can
realise
1 One hesitates to use the wotd mind, which is so confusedly treated by
most philosophers and psychologists. Probably the most consistent use of the
word is that of gestalt psychology. Of any conscious field, mind consists of
those elements most closely adherent to the sensory or subjective pole. Idealist
philosophers use the word mind more loosely. All phenomena are counted as
mental because they form part of conscious fields, and since all objects are
only known
as phenomena,
all
objects
are counted
as
mental. Thus the
idealist reduces Reality to *'Mind*', and since he knows phenomena as part
of his conscious field, Reality is only *‘his mind*’.

his
emotional
peculiarities
to
the
full
within
its
frame*
A sunset is nothing to a beast; art makes it what it is to us*
When words arouse a feeling-tone in us, we draw it from the
social ego; otherwise how could a mere sound exactly arouse,
like a note on a piano, a corresponding emotional reverberation
selected from a socially recognised scale of values?
It
is precisely because the complex
social world and social
ego offers such possibilities of realisation for the individuality,
that we hear in modern civilisation so many complaints of the
strangling of individuality by
society* No
such
complaints
are voiced in savage society, for the possibility of freedom does
not
yet
exist* Man
is
too
simple and
cabined* When
the
development of the productive forces has been accomplished by
a corresponding development in the social world and the social
ego, giving man undreamed-of possibilities of self-realisation,
and yet the utilisation of these forces
is manifestly
held hack hy
the
productive relations, then on all sides arise protests of
emotional
starvation'^ and ^'crippling of personalities" in a world of rich
consciousness,
complaints which are the ideological counter-
part of denunciations of malnutrition and unemployment in a
world of plenty* They are part of the continually increasing
volume
of
protest
against
modern
society*
They
are
the
harbingers of revolution*
4
We
saw
that
in
experience
neither
object
nor
subject,
matter nor mind,
is
ever completely "pure", and that
this
"impurity"
is
reflected in language* Therefore the common
world and
the common ego do
not
live
apart,
they
inter-
penetrate* Always, given in the Word,
is a certain subjective
attitude towards a certain piece of reality* Science, concerned
with objective
reality,
uses words
as far as possible so
as to
eliminate or cancel out the subject: art to build it up*
All experience
is organised,
is real There is not just a blur
of phenomena, but things separate themselves out into a real
spatial world*
In the same way
feelings
are organised,
they
come to a point in the ego, they have stability and radiate out
and have broad drives and homogeneities*

VIII
THE WORLD AND THE
''l*'
I53
Words therefore cannot just be flung together in a hotch-
potch* They must have organisation: express something real
a part of the universe, and a real attitude towards
it—a part
of the ego.
When we
are making a
scientific
statement, we make
it
about
observable
things—observable
operations
of ordering,
observable
colours,
actions and the
like. We assume always
there
is
^^someone^^
doing
this
ordering and
counting. The
assumption
is
so
implicit and
naive
that
scientists do
not
always realise that they are making this assumption and that
they are referring everything to one observer. If queried, they
will reply
that
this observer
is any
^'right-thinking person
^
without explaining what right-thinking person could have so
bewildering a range of experience, and maintain so
neutral,
so admirably judicial an attitude towards
it. The scientist has
tended to regard
this understood observer as just a piece of
scaffolding,
and
to
assume
that,
if
it were
necessary,,
the
scaffolding could easily be knocked away—it would make no
difference
to
the
building.
But
the
latest developments
of
physics! have shown that if this scaffolding is knocked away
nothing is left. The building absolutely depends on the scaffold-
ing
for
its
support. This
queer,
universal "Mock Ego"
of
science
is
illusory and yet
necessary:
all
the
reality which
science's
language
symbolises
is
attached
to "him". Only
mathematics seem’s to escape him, and then only because, as we
have seen,
it escapes from outer reality into the human brain
and becomes a mere extension of the Mock Ego^s personality.
This Mock Ego is not of course taken seriously by scientists.
He is appreciated as an abstraction. There is no interest in his
home life or hobbies.
Now in
precisely
the same way when poetry—or
literary
art generally—^wishes
to
"symbolise"
the
social
ego,
wishes
to convey
aflFective attitudes in an organised way,
it
is
still
compelled to make some statement about reality. The emotions
are only found in real life adhering to bits of reality; therefore
bits of reality—and moreover
organised' bits—^must always be
presented to achieve the emotional attitude. But the statement
! In particular, Heisenberg*s Principle of Indeterminacy and the conflict of
quantum physics with relativity physics.

154
ILLUSION AND REALITY
VIII
about
reality
selected for the underlying emotional
attitude
is not supposed to be about
material
reality, any more than
science's Mock Ego is supposed to be a real man* It is a mock
world;
it is an illusion, accepted as such* So, by a long road,
we have arrived back at the illusion, ^the mimesis^ which is the
essence and puzzle and method of literary art*
This mock ego of science and this mock world of art are
both necessary because object and subject are never parted in
experience,
but engage in the contradiction of an unceasing
struggle*
Science and
arc,
separated out from mythology by
an
initial
division of labour
so
that each can be better de-
veloped, keeps
as
a souvenir of separation a kind of scar or
blind side like the Norwegian trolls which are hollow behind*
This hollowness or blind side
is the mock ego of science and
the mock world of art* Science and art are like the two halves
produced by
cutting
the
original human hermaphrodite
in
half,
according to the story of Aristophanes in Mato's Sym-
posium^
so that each half evermore seeks
its counterpart* But
science and art do not when fitted together make a complete
concrete
world:
they make
a
complete
hollow
world—an
abstract world only made solid and living by the inclusion of
the
concrete
living of concrete men, from which
they
are
generated*
What then is the purpose^ the social function, of science and
art? Why are reared upon this mock world and this mock man
a frigid but true image of reality and a phantastic but warm
reflection of man's own countenance?
Both
are generated
as part of the
social process: they
are
social products, and the
social product whether material
or
ideological
can have
only one
goal,
that
of freedom*
It
is
freedom that man
seeks in
his
struggle with Nature*
This
freedom, precisely because it cannot be won except by action,
is not a freedom of mere contemplation* To attain it a man
does not merely relapse into himself—'let himself go"* Just
as the spontaneity of art
is the result of laborious
action,
so
freedom
has
as
its
price,
not
eternal
vigilance but
eternal
labour* Science and art are guides to action*
(l) Science makes available for the individual a deeper, more
complex insight into outer reality*
It modifies the perceptual

content of his consciousness so that he can move about a world
he more clearly and widely understands; and this penetration
of
reality
extends beyond
his
dead environment
to human
beings considered objectively,
that
is, as objects of his
action^
as the anvil to his hammer* Because this enlarged and complex
world is only opened up by men in association—^being beyond
the task of one man—^it is a social reality, a world common to
all men* Hence
its enlargement permits the development of
associated men to a higher plane at the same time as it extends
the freedom of the individual*
It
is the consciousness of the
necessity of outer reality*
(z) The other world of art^ of organised emotion attached
to experience, the world of the social ego that endures all and
enjoys all and by
its experience organises
all, makes available
for the individual a whole new universe of inner feeling and
desire* It exposes the endless potentiality of the instincts and
the ^^heart*^ by revealing the various ways in which they may
adapt themselves to experiences* It plays on the inner world of
emotion as on a stringed instrument* It changes the emotional
content of his consciousness so that he can react more subtly
and deeply
to the world* This penetration of inner
reality,
because it is achieved by men in association and has a com-
plexity beyond the task of one man to achieve,
also exposes
the hearts of his fellow men and raises the whole communal
feeling of society
to
a new plane of complexity*
It makes
possible new levels of conscious sympathy, understanding and
affection between men, matching the new
levels of material
organisation achieved by economic production* Just as in the
rhythmic
introversion
of
the
tribal
dance
each
performer
retired into
his
heart,
into the fountain of his
instincts,
to
share in common with his fellows not a perceptual world but
‘a world of instinct and blood-warm rhythm,
so
to-day the
instinctive ego of art is the common man into which we retire
to establish contact with our fellows* Art is the consciousness
of the necessity oTthe instincts*
(3) It
is important to understand that art
is no more pro-
paganda than
science* That does n6t mean that neither has
a»social role to perform* On the contrary, their role is one which
is as

propaganda: that of changing men's minds* They change men's
minds in a special way* Take
as an extreme case of science's
way of changing man's view of outer reality, a mathematical
demonstration* It cannot be said to persuade* A mathematical
demonstration appears either true or false:
if true,
it simply
injects
itself into our minds
as an additional piece of outer
reality* If false, we reject it as mere word-spinning* But if we
accept
it, we are no more persuaded of its truth than we are
persuaded of the
^Truth" of a house standing in front of us*
We do not accept it: we see it*
In the same way, in art, we are not persuaded of the existence
of Hamlet's
confusion
or
Prufrock's
seedy world-weariness,
we are not persuaded of the existence of Elsinore or Proust's
madeline cake* The whole feeling-complex of the poem or the
play or the novel
is injected into our subjective world* We
feel so-and-so and such-and-such* We
are no more persuaded
of their truth than of the truth of a toothache: but the vividness
or
social universality of the emotional pattern
is announced
by
the
poignancy of the
sensation we
call
Beauty*
Music
affords an even more striking example of this*
Thus neither Truth nor Beauty are persuasion,
just because
they are guides to action* Persuasion must be not a guide but a
persuasion to action, a pressure to be or do differently* In fact
science and art are opposite poles of language, and language
has
as
its main function
the
role of persuasion*
It has only
evolved these poles as refinements,
as tempered spearheads of
the advance of life* Art and science are persuasion become so
specialised as to cease to be persuasion,
just as in the flower
petals the leaves have become so specialised as to cease to fulfil
the function of leaves*
Language sucks
its lif®-blood from daily
life, and in daily
life all conversation which is not informative of outer reality
regarded objectively
(e*g* of events
or
the
speaker's
feelings
treated
objectively) or of inner
reality
(e*g*
accent, angry or
pleased "tones",
facial expressions,
circumlocutions, manner,
polite,
.curt,
surprising or warm phraseology),
is
rhetorical in
* the Aristotelian sense, that is, it is designed to persuade others
to act in a certain way and feel in a certain way*
Now rhetoric stands in this relation to science and art, that

VIII
THE WORLD AND THE
''l*'
157
it is not a guide to action on outer reality or on the instincts
but “is always mixed or counterpointed* Thus in so
far
as a
man already has an instinctive urge to do something in a certain
situation, then persuasion is directed to so explaining the nature
of outer
reality that he
will
see the
necessity of doing the
particular things to which we wish to persuade him* On the
other
hand,
if
the
situation
plainly
indicates
action,
our
persuasion
is directed to arousing the emotional urge to fulfil
the action* Thus there is a kind of reversal of the use of words:
for
emotional
reasons
objective
statements
are
used,
for
objective
reasons
emotional
statements;
but
generally both
are mixed*
Rhetoric
or persuasion
is the
tiniversal mode of language
through which men freely guide and leaH each other by appeal-
ing in day-to-day activity on the one hand to the necessities of
the task, and on the other hand to the demands of the instincts*
Rhetoric, too,
is rooted in outer reality and the genotype, and
because it is more direct, urgent and prosaic it is more primitive
and everyday* It is the warp and woof of language as an instru-
ment of association, from which science and art separate them-
selves as more
specialised, .more organised, more aloof, more
abstract and more real and convincing in their special fields precisely
because of their use of those unreal and illusory scaffoldings,
the mock ego and the mock world*
That persuasion can be used to mislead,
that rhetoric can
be empty
and
hypocritical,
is merely
to
repeat in another
form the well-known facts that truth and error both exist and
that man makes mistakes* It does not invalidate persuasion as
such* Science can be false, art trite, persuasion hypocritical or
misleading; as society develops historically, the false persuasion
emerges from the true*
We
see,
then,
that language communicates not simply a
dead image of outer reality but
also and simultaneously an
attitude towards it, and does so because all experience, all life,
all reality emerges .consciously in the course of man^s struggle
with Nature* This image of outer reality and this ego do not
confront each other stonily across a chasm; they emerge from

ILLUSION AND REALITY
VIII
158
and return again into concrete living; they are the results of a
dialectic development* Between them is the bridge of matter*
Both are built on the soil which connects body and environ-
ment* The very nature of language
is
a proof of that inter-
penetration. Art and science therefore, through the means of
social
action,
mediated by persuasion,
continually play into
each other's hands* Because man's life is educed from present
reality by the contradiction between man and Nature,
outer
reality and inner feeling by this very contradiction mutually
develop each other and themselves*
Poetry,
like the human
life of which
it
is an emanation,
springs from the fruitful quarrel of mathematics and music*

THE PSYCHE AND PHANTASY
I
Poetry
is
written
by
a
poet*
The
contradiction
which
generates it is a special case of the contradiction that drives on
society and is fought out in the real life and real consciousness
of men—the contradiction between man's desires and Nature's
necessity* Poetry springs from the contradiction between the
instincts and experience of the poet* This tension drives him
to build the world of illusory phantasy which yet has a definite
and functional
relation to the real world of which
it
is the
blossom*
The twentieth century has learned a good deal about the
general nature of phantasy* Among
its important discoveries
are
those
of psycho-therapy,
using
the" pioneer methods
of
Charcot, Janet, Morton Prince and, above
all, Freud* Freud's
disciples iFounded many rival schools, of which the best known
are those of Jung (analytical psychology) and Adler (individual
psychology)*
Probably
in no
other
field* has
the
essential weakness
of
modern science been more clearly shown than in the subsequent
development of the important data gained by Freud in his early
researches* This weakness
is the lack of any synthetic world-
view
in which
to
fit
the
empirical
discoveries made* The
researches
of a
brilliant
investigator such
as Freud
increase
instead of clarifying the hopeless confusion of modern ideology*
The scientist is left with two alternatives* On the one hand,
he
regards
his
discoveries
as
limited
to
his own particul^
sphere and
adopts
towards
reality
as
a whole
a
complete
eclecticism,
which
leads
inevitably
to
a view
of
reality
as
essentially unknowable and to a conception of science as a mere
collection of convenient summaries of empirical discoveries not
necessarily capable of coherence or synthesis* Or, on the other
hand, the scientist who has made some, important discoveries
may, in default of a world-view common to science as a whole,

l6o
ILLUSION AND REALITY
IX
erect a complete ideology on the limited basis of the particular
discoveries he has made* Naturally such an ideology will be a
travesty of reality and will
fail
to account for most of the
important
features of reality and of the human mind* The
things unaccounted for by its explanation are forcibly reduced
to the level of the other few facts by the crude
* ^nothing but'"
method*
If, however, this happens to be repugnant to the scientist, as
will be the case if he is a scientist of some breadth of culture,
then mystical explanations will be given for the other phen-
omena inexplicable by his limited world-view* A large portion
of
reality
will
be
conveniently removed
to
the
sphere
of
religion,
as
among
the
vitalists,
holists,
entelechists
and
spiritualists generally*
Freud
is
representative
of empiricism with
its
reductive
method,
while
Jung
tends
towards
a
more
eclectic
and
mystical point of view*
Freud
finds
sexuality—^using
a somewhat broad
definition
of sexuality—^present in all human ideology, but most clearly
seen in
the products of neurotic
conflicts* This sublimated
sexuality
takes
a number
of
forms:
artistic,
religious
and
philosophical* It
is in fact the generating force of all human
activity*
*'But then", the objector urges,
"sexuality
is some-
thing
else besides
sexuality, which by definition
is
a certain
instinct directed to the accomplishment of the sexual
act?"
"No," Freud answers, "sexuality is unable to take this simple
form, because it comes into conflict with the stern prohibitions
of the super-ego and the ego in the psyche* The wealth of
ideology is produced in its attempt to sublimate the conflict*
This
ideology
includes
religion,
morals,
art,
philosophy,
neuroses and dreams*"
Freud takes the
arbitrary,
ego-instinct duel further by his
concept of the Pleasure and Reality Principles* The pleasure
principle represents the instinctive desires of the sexual part of
the psyche* The ego
is associated with the reality principle*
Here we have noming but a special version of the familiar
biological opposition—the instinctive organism and its adapta-
tion to the environment*
Freud's pleasure principle (which as he himself admits, must

IX
THE PSYCHE AND PHANTASY
l6l
include hunger and other
instincts beside the sexual)
is
the
appetitive striving of life, and the reality principle is that con-
ditioning
or
adaptation
of
its
appetites
produced
by
the
environment. This adaptative instinct, seen in action, appears
as the cat stalking the mouse,
the otter fishing,
the deer on
watch ^nd
fleeing.
But no
hard-and-fast
line can be drawn
between the two. In seeking a mate,
in seeking food
or in
evading danger, a pleasure principle is being followed, but the
animkl cannot ignore external reality; indeed it is only by the
help of its adaptations to reality that it gratifies its appetitive
instincts. Why then do
the two not come
into" conflict
in
animals and so create a neurosis and an ideology? Why
is the
conscious ego in man associated with the reality principle and
not
with
the
more
''egoistic''
appetitive
instincts
of
sex,
hunger or self-preservation?
Freud
is, in
fact, only rediscovering in his new but
Linnted
sphere, categories as old as any known to human thought, and
then applying them, with the^ nomenclature and special twist
they receive in his domain, back to the whole sphere of human
thought. It is the old contradiction between subject and object,
between man and Nature, betw^n instinct and environment,
between free will and necessity, between life and matter, which
appears in Freud's psychology in three diflPerent dresses:
(a) as
the pleasure principle and the reality principle,
(h) as the life
instinct and the death mstinct,
(c) as the ego (together with its
emanations the id and the super-ego) and the libido.
Now we have
already remarked about
this
subject-object
dualism (which has been the constant ground of our study so
far) that men have tended to separate them as mutually exclu-
sive opposites and to give only one the status of reality. Thus
all reality is reduced to those phenomena which do not contain
any part of the other: since these two opposites are not exclusive
but
mutually
interpenetrate,
such
a
reduction
eventually
reduces the world to precisely nothing but a meaningless name.
Since he is a psychologist and not a philosopher, Freud does
not treat of all reality but only of mentation,
conscious and
unconscious, considered objectively. Yet here, exactly as in the
field of knowledge
as a whole,
the same interpenetration of
environihent and instinct takes place, and it is never possible
L

l6z
ILLUSION AND REALITY
IX
to separate any mentation as specifically instinctive and in no
way conditioned by the environment. The attempt to do so, to
discard as
* 'additional' ' or "sublimated"
all mentation which
bears the stamp of the environment,
involves excluding layer
after layer of consciousness as secondary and unreal until one
reaches
as the only true psychic reality something vague and
formless, a mere name-
libido.
Yet this discovery was in fact given from the start in Freud's
bourgeois approach to psychology. The bourgeois philosopher
is unable to rise above the standpoint of the individual in civil
society. All social activity is the product of the free will and
dynamic urge of the individual as it emerges immediately in its
own
consciousness
grappling
direct with Nature.
Since
its
instinctive centre is the source of its freedom, any restrictions
placed on it by social relations cripple and distort its range of
action.
This conception is, of course, appropriate to a class the con-
ditions of whose existence are that he is free to produce exactly
what seems best to him in view of the market,
the market
itself being but a kind of extension of Nature or the environ-
ment. To such a class, the initial condition of whose develop-
ment
was
that
it
abolished
all
feudal
relations,
freedom
necessarily seems to inhere in the individual by divine right,
and freedom appears as the ignorance of the necessity of those
social relations which influence the individual's desires.
Such a conception leads
to a wholly false view of society
and freedom, and in psychology, therefore,, to a misinterpreta-
tion of the social contents of the psyche and of the way in
which the instincts become free. It reflects the view of a class
whose own developing freedom
rests on
its
alienation from
active struggle with the environment, and in whose ideology
therefore there is already a cleavage between subject and object.
Instead of seeing that subject and object are separated actively
by their mutual struggle, such a view supposes that they are
already separated contemplatively by their mutually exclusive
nature. Such a misunderstanding can only lead to ari interpre-
tation
of
the
world
in
terms
of
either
subjectivism
or
mechanism,
and
Freud,
although
he
regards
himself
as
a
materialist, chooses the subject. Libido, the source of free action,

163
creates
the
psychic
environment which
cripples
it*
Freud^s
idealistic presumption is the simple presumption of Rousseau s
* ^natural man^^ who is born free and is everywhere in chains*
But we have already seen that the instincts, unadapted by
society, are blind and therefore unfree* The brute
is not free;
the ant is the slave of its innate responses* Mafrs freedom
is
obtained by association, which makes
it possible for him to
acquire mastery over Nature through becoming actively con-
scious of its necessity and his own* This association of itself
necessarily imposes certain restrictions, conventions and obliga-
tions, such as those of good behaviour, language and mutual
aid* But
all these things are not fetters on the free instincts
(libido);
they
are the instruments by which
instinctive man
realises his freedom* The view of reality which is science, the
canons of feeling which are art and ethics, are imposed on the
instincts from without; none the
less
they
are not
fetters,
distortions, inhibitions or sublimations* They are the means by
which instinct realises its freedom because they give it under-
standing of Nature^s necessity and its own and therefore are
since Nature will not yield to a mere wish—the only means by
which the will can actively realise itself* And man's conscious-
ness, with
its
ego,
its sublimations,
its
distortions, and
its
vivid rich complexity,
is nothing but the adaptation produced
in man's psychic genotype by the conditions of working
in
association with other men towards the realisation of freedom*
Consciousness, in the broadest sense (including therefore the
subconscious, which
is also the product of modified instinct),
is a social product* It
is not merely
dhiat consciousness has a
social component* The
construction of consciousness
is* the
socialising of the psyche*
-
^
Of course individuals vary, ^nd this individuality is reflected
in
their
consciousnesses,
just
as
the
difference
in
a man's
anatomy is reflected in his clothes* Yet clothes are clothes and
not flesh and blood, and these social adaptations of the human
psyche are the very means by which individual differences are
realised and accentuated* Also human experiences
differ, and
since consciousnesses are determined by experience, individual
consciousnesses will differ, but this is only to say that society
itself by division of labour has so differentiated itself as to give

ILLUSION AND REALITY
IX
164
rise to the possibility of widely different individual adventures
in the world of geography ot of feeling;
this difference con-
trasts with the simple sameness of lives among the members of
a herd and once again shows that the development of society
is the means by which differences are realised and personality
attains its full worth*
Since consciousnesses are determined by the social complex
made necessary by a given historical development of the pro-
ductive forces, and it is not, as Freud assumes, that society is
determined
instantly
by
the make-up
of
the
psyche,
the
historical production of ideology, phantasy, dream and the like
must depend on an historical change in the structure of men's
social complex*
It must be plain that
this
is
so,
for if the
innate qualities of the psyche determined the social complex
and also the consciousness and ideological productions of its
members, how could these vary so much from age to age and
culture to culture, when man's genetic make-up barely varies at
all in historical times?
It can be shown that the material productive forces of society,
and the relations between men made necessary by these, vary
and develop
historically according to deterministic laws of a
quality
peculiar
to
the
sphere
of
society,
and
since
this
development
is fought out in the consciousnesses of the men
who engage in these relations,
it is possible to explain scienti-
fically the
ceaseless change of ideology and
, individual
con-
sciousness in spite of an invariant psychic genotype* To cut
away all thesQ material causes, as Freud does, is to cut away the
only
means
of
understanding
scientifically
the
cause
of
historical changes in ideology*
It
also
robs
his
therapy of any’ but a local and particular
value*
Since the
distortions and
variations of consciousness,
including all neurotic conflicts, are generated, not by material
conditions of living but by the psyche torturing itself, by the
ego separating itself and issuing stern demands to the libido,
man can only be cured by becoming conscious of the cause of
his conflict which, since it is all in the psyche, can by the same
effort of will be removed* Hence Freud's therapeutic theory is
solipsist and religious*
Empiricist
as he
is, he does not of course carry
this out

IX
THE PSYCHE AND PHANTASY
165
consistently* He admits material causes for neurotic conflicts,
such
as
family
upbringing,
psychic
traumata
derived from
experience, unhappy surroundings and puritan education* But
he does not fully see that if this kind of explanation is to be
carried out in any
scientific
spirit of thorough-going deter-
minism,
it at once shifts the responsibility for the organisation
of consciousness on to the material basis of society* He does not
fully see that if the super-ego is a reflection of the parent, then
—since the parent's behaviour to the" child, and his status in
regard to it, are reflections of the economic development of the
erai—the formation of the super-ego, which is the key to most
neurotic conflicts,
is determined by sociological laws* To admit
this fully would make psycho-therapy—once the connections
between the psyche and the environment were understood
a matter of understanding how to modify the social environ-
ment itself* Of course with a rich neurotic the environment can
be modified more easily, and since Freud's patients are mainly
of this type, it suffices to state the problem of the environmental
causation of neuroses in the
partial vague way he does* But
applied to society as a whole, any such therapy is—^literally
revolutionary*
For although society is the instrument of man's freedom,
it
by no means follows that it
is a perfect' instrument* On the
contrary
its
imperfections
are
what
produce
the
constant
development of society* The very nature of class society neces-
sarily
involves
that
the
productive
forces—on whose power
men's freedom
is based—tend in varying degrees to become
stifled and crippled by the social relations which made possible
their initial development*
Class society itself is only a result
of the division of labour which raised social productivity to
new levels* At such periods it certainly seems as if man s social
relations
are
crippling
his
possibilities of freedom* At such
times he groans and travails and cries out because the forms and
restraints—the morals, religions and all the conscious formula-
tions of society—are crippling his
*^free"
instincts* The very
neuroses which Freud investigates, and which are so characteris-
tically modern, are products of this travail—the labour pangs
of a new society*

ILLUSION AND REALITY
IX
Freud
is
always
faced by
the dilemma
of deducing
the
changing phenomena of
consciousness
and
mentation from
unchanging
instincts and an unchanging
biological
environ-
ment*
This
can
only be
done,
as we
have shown,
by
the
introduction of a
variable,
the
relations made
necessary by
economic production: but Freud
ignores
this* Hence he
is
driven to deduce historical change from the make-up of the
individual psyche, and he therefore imagines to be a permanent
part of the psyche what
are merely
reflections of a special
social environment*
Jung
is well aware of the contradictions in psychology* He
regards them, however,
as mechanical and mutually exclusive
opposites—such
opposites
as
^introversion''
and
^^extra-
version", or ^^energic quantitative finality"- and ^^rAaterialistic
qualitative
causality"* He
is
never able
to
resolve
the con-
tradictions
he
raises,
because
he
never
passes 'from
the
contradictions
of
psychology
to
the
sphere
immediately
beneath psychology, that of society itself* Instead he passes in
the opposite direction, from psychology to the epistemology'
evolved by psyches, and
gets
lost in the old familiar meta-
physical
difficulties of subject and
object* Thus by a more
philosophical and less empirical path, Jung arrives at the same
dilemma as Freud* Since the neurotic
conflict
is due to the
conflict between life and reality, which religion in its various
forms has been evolved to sublimate, how is the patient to be
cured?
Freud
recommended
telling
the
patient
that
the
medicine was only water from the tap, in the belief that the
shock would cure him* (Cure by abreaction*) Jung recommends
that the patient should be allowed
to believe
in the water,
should in fact be encouraged to spin his own fancies about it*
(Cure ^by synthesis*) Jung justifies himself in this betrayal of
science by the belief that back of all mythology are primeval
structures inherent in the mind (the archetypes) which interact
with
the
patient's
ideology and
so
generate myths*
These,
although they are not truly true, are yet psychologically true*
(Birth of the Hero*) Thus Jung also chooses the subject and
a fundamentally idealistic approach* Their therapy is a therapy
of will-power and mystic mind-controL

candidly and openly, but only in the limited form of -erotic
transference to the analyst. The analyst tries to
fill the role of
society and necessarily
fills
it meanly and in a limited way.
Neither see that the problem is of its nature one which cannot
be solved only in the sphere of consciousness divorced from
action.
Nor do Freud
or Jung
see
that,
in
so
far
as
religion
is
brought in by man to j^l^ster up a decaying culture, man will
have no difficulty in giving birth to new mythologies without
the
need
of
archetypes
or
the .psycho-analyst*s
midwifery.
Dying
bourgeois
culture
has
in
fact
evolved
the
vigorous
religion of fascism, complete with mythology and choreagus,
as seen in Germany and Italy. The neurotic conflict
is a real
thing and Jung and Freud are right when they see the germs of
it in all
civilised beings. But they are wrong in supposing
it
to be a pathological product of civilisation which would be
removed if only we could do away with civilisation. The con-
flict between man^s
instincts
and
environmental
reality
is
precisely what
life
is, and
all the products of society—^hats,
art,
science,
houses,
sport,
ethics and political organisation
are adaptations
evolved
to moderate and
cure
that
conflict.
Since
the
successful
issue of this
conflict
is freedom,
it
is
nonsense to talk of these adaptations as crippling freedom qua
adaptations. They only cripple freedom to the degree in which
they grow obsolete and begin to stifle the developing freedom
they have already generated. This crippling is not a sign that
adaptations must be done away with but that fresh adaptations
are needed. It is therefore pointless to ask oneself, as Freud does,
whether civilisation
is worth the price one pays for
it in the
frustration and crippling of the instincts, for it was precisely
to moderate and lessen the frustration and crippling of the
instincts by the environment that civilisation was evolved.
Hence psycho-analysts play a petty part during the break-
down of modern civilisation in war, unemployment, universal
degradation, hatred and despair. Plainly there is a world-wide
conflict between the instincts and the environment and ^1 the
tremendous and elaborate superstructure of society—^religion,
art, laws, science,
states, patriotism,
ethics, political aims ancf
aspirations, liberty, comfort, peace, life itself—all these things

yet
it was
just
this splendid
edifice that man constructed to suhlimate^ in Freudian nomen-
clature,
to
resolve,
in
ours,
the
contradiction
between
his
environment
and
his
instincts*
This
immense
decaying
superstructure fills with awe the mind even of the revolutionary
who sees the cause of its collapse and the
still more complex
structure which will supersede
it; but
as
a substitute for
it
the
psycho-analysts solemnly
offer
th^ meagre
constructs
of
Freudian
philosophy
or Jungian
mythology,
tattered
scraps
expected to heal the conflict which a whole Europe of human
achievement cannot resolve*
On
the
surface
Adler's approach seems more
realistic*
In
his
theory of the struggle
for
existence and the consequent
development of an
inferiority complex and
a compensatory
ability,
he realised the way in which bourgeois
competition
strangles in its final stages all the best in man's individuality
and ability* He recognised the environment*
Let us take a quotation from Adler:
In a civilisation where one man is the enemy of the other—for this is what
our
whole
industrial
system means—demoralisation
is
ineradicable,
for
demoralisation and crime are the by-products of the struggle for existence as
known to our industrialised civilisation*
So
far,
so good* Here we have an analysis of the general
effect of capitalism on the individual* What
is his remedy?
To limit and do away with this demoralisation, a chair of curative pedagogy
should be established.

We
see,
then,
that
psycho-analysts
are
idealist
in
their
approach to the practical problems of living, and in no
'jvay
take up
an
attitude
different from that of the great
class-
religions* For
if man's
subjective
feelings of misery,
unease
and unhappiness, are not due to outer material causes but to
^Sin (as the religions put it) or Complexes (as the analyst puts
it), then man's misery, unhappiness and unease can be cured
by casting out sin, by self-control, by salvation, by abreaction

Indeed, many of
the class-religions have gone further in jthat they have developed
organisations
for
clearing up
certain
sectors
of misery
by
material action—societies to care for the sick, for example*
If the root causes of broad areas of human misery are due
to
the surroundings
in which the psyche
develops, and the
obstacles,
possibilities, adaptations and attractions offered by
the social relations of that environment, then they can only be
eliminated by a material change, which will make possible a
change of heart* This view is opposed both to that of religion
and of psycho-analysis*
Aside altogether from the question of revolution, if the strife
between man's
instincts and environment
can be cured by
^^education", by a mental self-change, why has man troubled
to
evolve
factories,

These
are
all
products of the struggle between the instincts and environnaent
and are all unnecessary if Freud and the religious teachers are
right,
since man's
conflict could be resolved merely by
his
becoming conscious of its causes*
Of
course,
faced with
such
an
obvious
instance
as
the
hunger
instinct,
Freud could not maintain
that
its
conflict
with
reality could be pacified by any means other than the
material therapy of food* But the logical basis of his theory is
certainly idealist or
and it is this which makes Freud-
ians
treat
art,
one of the instruments of men's freedom,
as
something childish and escapist in tendency* They do not see
that the human conflict between man and Nature (of which the
neurotic
conflict
is only a special form)
drives men
to
free
association, and that art is a necessity of this association, the
means whereby
it remains
free, and because it is free reaches
heights and depths inaccessible to a coerced association*
The whole
of
psycho-analytical
writing
flounders
in
the
marsh of bourgeois
epistemology, where
subject and object
appear as mutually exclusive opposites under a hundred will-
o'-the-wisp
disguises and where
the problems
of mind
are
insoluble precisely because in the society which generates this

have
ceased
to
interpenetrate
actively
and
so
establish in practice their theoretical identity of opposites*
What
is
consciousness? Unconsciousness?
Instinct?
Reality?
Mind? Illusion? Understanding of these concepts
is evidently
vital for a psychology—^and it is not surprising that Freudism,
with
its
naive
Rousseauistic
idealism,
cannot
achieve
a
satisfactory psychology*
The individual
is born with certain instincts,
evidenced in
action
(response
to
stimulus)
and
changed
in
that
action
(conditioned response)* That conditioning includes conscious-
ness: memory, images, thoughts, percepts and recognitions are
the conditioning of instincts*
But not
all
conditioning of instincts
is
consciousness*
It
is important to understand that there
is nothing mysterious
in
unconscious
mentation* The
repetition which
is
subtly
different,
the
circling rhythm which
is a spiral, the reaction
which
is
changed
because of what has gone
before,
is
not
peculiar to mind or life, but is a general characteristic of the
process of reality* The like. Space, is generated by the ingression
of the unlike. Time* Only when this process evidences itself
in the sphere of life do we call
it psychic; but then we have
no reason to
call
it conscious, any more than the purposeful
activities of the autonomous
nervous
system
are
conscious*
The thing to be explained and accounted for as an intruder is
not unconsciousness but
consciousness* Only our immediate
experience of it can give us grounds for accepting it*
As
soon
as
a mentation becomes
conscious,
it makes
a
qualitative leap and enters the sphere of free will* Conscious
mentations are different in quality from unconscious precisely
because they
are
conscious*
Consciousness
is a
real material
quality and not an epiphenomenon; it is the quality of freedom
in mentation*
The behaviourists argue that we have no right to deduce
consciousness
in
others,
and
that
their
actions
can
all
be
explained deterministically by the
sufficient stimulus* Their
argument as to the non-existence of mind is sound as long as it
remains
in
the
sphere
of theory,
just
as
is
the
subjective
idealist^s argument
as
to the non-existence of matter*
It
is
disproved in practice* Aware ourselves of a qualitative difference

THE PSYCHE AND PHANTASY
IJl
in actions when they are associated with conscious thoughts,
we jEnd, in our active intercourse with others, that their actions
show
similar
diflFerences*
In
so
far
as we depend on
their
consciousness in our transactions with them, and these transac-
tions are successful, we prove the reality of their consciousness*
This
in
itself gives us
the
clue
to what consciousness
is*
Consciousness
is
the
product
of
association:
not
of herd
association which
is mediated by instincts, but of association
for
economic
production
which
is
mediated
precisely
by
consciousness—^by specific adaptations of the psychic instincts*
We can never prove consciousness in terms of the theory of
the common perceptual world because it is entirely that world*
In the same way we can. never prove not-consciousness (matter)
because it is entirely not that world*
Objects
detach
themselves
as
objects
from
the
flux
of
perception in
so
far
as they become objects for social men*
The
sun,
a mere
unrecognised
source
of phototropism
for
animals, becomes a socially recognised object for man, ripener
of harvest, measure of the working day,
clock and compass
of the hunter* The field* of perception is organised into figure
and ground only in so far as figures have a significance for the
conjoint action of ‘men*
Instinctual appetite
is
the
basis of
this organisation, but it is lifted to a higher plane,
it becomes
conscious,
as soon as it is an organisation for society*
This
is
equally true of our
affective world* This
flowing
penumbra of instinctive music only acquires a pattern,
only
becomes conscious^ to the extent that social life itself organises
feelings,
sentiments,
passions,
enduring
trends,
aims
and
aspirations which draw
their
stability from the
relations of
associated men*
In the fashioning of consciousness the great instrument
is
language*
It
is language which makes us consciously
see the
sun,
the
stars,
the
rain and
the
sea—objects which merely
elicit responses from animals* It is this which makes us capable
of appreciating truth and beauty: for truth is a relation between
a perception of reality and the common perceptual world, and
beauty
is a relation between a feeling-tone of reality and the
xommon ego*
Thus we
see that what makes the difference between the

ILLUSION AND REALITY
IX
IJZ
unconscious brute that a man would be if reared like Mowgli
hj a wolfish foster-mother, and the conscious human he in fact
becomes in society,
is the active relation between his personal
experience
of reality and the common perceptual world and
common
affective
ego.
Science and
art expand and develop
this world and this ego. They are not contained in them; they
are secreted in the whole complex of a working society. Science
and art may for various reasons in some respect oppose or deny
the perceptual reality and affective attitude given in concrete
social experience. In such a case science or art seems to conflict
with a man's consciousness.
The common world and the common ego are generated by
the active struggle of associated men with Nature, as a living
historical development; and the consciousness' of an individual
is formed in organic connection with this struggle. Once again
we repeat that the common perceptual world and the common
ego do not stamp a standardised pattern on the genotype: like
the society of which they are products and reflections they are
the
meai^s
whereby
the
genotype
realises
its
individual
differences in the psychic sphere.
^
.
It is for this reason that consciousness and conscience have
so close a connection: for the conscience—^fche imprinted sum-
mary of the ethical laws of society—is a special integration of
the individual consciousness,
just as truth, beauty and reality
are other integrations, playing similar social roles.
This is not to say that there cannot be a conflict of conscience,
divided aims and the like. On the one hand man's struggle with
Nature is never absolutely victorious, and just as ^'accidents",
like an earthquake or an attack of malaria, may reveal the rela-
tivity of any victory, so in the psychological sphere madness,
murder, neuroses or melancholy reveal that man's adaptations
do not extend to the full conquest either of himself or Nature.
Man
is
not yet
completely
free. The
consciousness
is
not
completely
integrated—different
layers may
have
different
trends.
In addition man's struggle with Nature
is complicated by
contradictions generated in the very instrument of his freedom,
society* This gives rise to local stresses and strains,
giant up-
heavals, revolutions, or the ruin and decline of whole societies.

XX
the psyche and phantasy
173
This
is
necessarily
reflected
in man's
consciousness—^moral
problems; feelings of sin, worthlessness and despair; widespread
death
thoughts;
vast
spiritual
needs;
loss
of
faith—these
emotional pangs are part of the travail of society*
In a primitive society where man is as yet undifferentiated,
conscience and consciousness
are similarly simple,
direct and
homogeneous, and for this very reason lacking in depth and
vividness*
Primitive
communities seem
to
have
^‘collective
representations" and a participation
mystique. When
this
con-
sciousness
is attacked,
there
is no complexity or balancing of
forces to soften the blow; the collapse is complete* The primi-
tive who is once convinced that he has sinned or is bewitched
will promptly die—a fact well-attested by field anthropologists*
The shallowness of his consciousness
is revealed in the sim-
plicity of his dissociation, the ease with which his psyche can
be precipitated into hysteria, his high degree of suggestibility
and the
“all-or-none" nature of his emotional reactions—all
symptoms
pointing
to
a
mentation more
unconscious and
instinctive than that of “civilised" differentiated man*
We are born not merely primitives but brutes. Our instincts
are not adapted genetically but by the social environment* We
have alreacfy pointed out that this is the whole meaning of con-
sciousness* Because our instinctive adaptations are acquired, our
mentation presents different levels of unconsciousness and
is
more or less instinctive*
It has an outer layer of civilisation,
below
it a more
primitive
layer,, and
still
lower
a merely
animal core* This has long been generally known; but it was
the achievement; of psycho-analysts, while in general misunder-
standing the
social
basis of consciousness,
to understand the
importance of unconscious mentation and to devise a technique
for probing it*
Because the interpenetration of subject and object
is com-
plete, because life and experience is always the struggle of the
instincts with the environment,
all mentation necessarily has
in
it a component of outer
reality and an instinctual com-
ponent* This
is not peculiar to consciousness but
is a feature
of all
living
responses* The
fact that even the autonomous
nervous system responds to and may be conditioned by environ-
mental influences reveals that it too has a “reality" component

ILLUSION AND REALITY
IX
174
in
its mentation. Hence the whole field of neural activity
is
interpenetrated both with environmental
or acquired
effects
and
innate
or
instinctive
effects.
Previous psychology was
chiefly concerned with acquired
effects—the
‘'real things'^
in
the conscious field: even the sentiments, feelings and instincts
of earlier psychology were regarded objectively and figured as
real things. Psycho-analysis therefore found a whole new field
to
conquer —the
exploration
of
the
instinctive
or
innate
elements in mentation considered not objectively but in action,
i.e.
in
their
ov^n
terms. Unfortunately they went to the other
extreme and rejected
all the objective components, with the
result that life reduced itself to a blind dynamic libido. This
libido seemed something preformed which wandered into the
world like a Christian soul incarnate, instead of arising from a
process in reality itself*
When we divide man into instinct and environment, we must
remember that man^s instinct itself is the product of environ-
mental adaptation (natural selection) but that
this
is inborn
biological adaptation, whereas man^s conscious adaptation is to
the
social
environment
and
is
therefore
acquired
cultural
adaptation.
Conflicts may
arise between these two
layers of
adaptations—the
biological
or
instinctive,
the
Cultural
or
conscious.
In normal
life
each
has
its own
sphere.
Purely
biological
adaptations
attend
to
man^s
digestion,
purely
cultural adaptations to man's design of a house; but in so far
as they overlap a mutual distortion may arise, Man's digestion
may be upset by an ugly house; his design of a house may be
done for money
i.e. to feed himself. Cooking becomes an art.
Art a bread-and-butter activity. It is this distortion "’and over-
lapping which psycho-analysis has studied. Since the biological
instincts are closely connected with the generation of emotion
and the feeling-tone in consciousness (the exact connection has
not yet been satisfactorily established), the study by psycho-
analysis of the distortion of the consciousness (including the
volition) by the instincts has been largely a study of the influ-
ence of emotional associations and complexes on men's thoughts
and actions. And since we have already discussed the organisa-
tion of the
affective elements of consciousness into
a com-
mon ego by
art,
it is plain
that
the
discoveries of psycho-

analysis must be an important aid in
the
understanding
of
art*
3
No satisfactory classification of mentation has yet been pro-
posed* We are concerned with the flow of images (not neces-
sarily visual) to which I give the name phantasy, to distinguish
them from clear perception or memory* We will use the follow-
ing
classification
of
these:
(a)
Dream;
(i)
Day-Dream
or
Reverie;
(c)
Free
Association;
(d)
Directed
Thinking;
(e)
Directed Feeling*
Until the psycho-analysts, no psychologist seriously studied
the dream* Thanks to Freud, we now see the absurdity of that
omission* Because of its primitive character and strange features,
the dream throws light on the nature of phantasy and the role of
thought*
The dream has
certain
characteristics which distinguish
it
from other kinds of thought* By far the most important is the
fact that in it thoughts—^the memory-images of percepts con-
densed,
displaced and modified—take
the place of the
real
environment* This is the specific feature of dream* In all other
forms of phantasy the thinker is still vaguely conscious of his
environment and does not site himself in the products of his
fancy; he does not give them the status of immediate surround-
ings* The dreamer does* Hence they acquire a vividness and
rounded
actuality such
as always belongs
to
the immediate
environment when it is the object of attention*
This
^ ^materialising*^ of thoughts is the result of introversion,
of a withdrawing of sensory^ attention from the environment.
This
introversion
is what
constitutes
sleep*
Sufferers from
anaesthesia of the skin have only to close their eyes—providing
the room is quiet—to fall into slumber. All the aids to sleep
darkness,
quiet,
mental blankness—^are
devices
for reducing
external sensory stimuli.
The materiality and vividness of dream-thoughts are thus only
relative. If one recalls dream faces, forms, words and scenes, they
are all vague, blurred,
colourless,
full of holes,
indefinite and
incomplete* But because no external sensory reality existed to
qtU&:rel with them, they assumed the status and vividness of

ILLUSION AND REALITY
IX
176
the environment*
It
is
this concentration of attention which
gives the dream material
its reality and vividness and not its
own internal coherence* On the contrary, the material of dream
is confused and patchy*
Jung
investigated
ordinary
^'free
association''—waking
associations
of one image
to
another
formed by
the mind
freely,
without
conscious
attention
to
reality* Dream
is an
elaborate form of continuous
free
association,
in which the
free
flow
of
phantasy
acquires
the
material
reality
of an
environment*
Freud
laid
bare
the mechanism
of 'this more
elaborate free association of dream*
Surridisme
bases
its
technique on
this
free
association*
It
hopes thus to realise a spontaneous artistic production* Here it
only displays the classic bourgeois illusion that freedom is the
ignorance of necessity*
Freud's and Jung's experiments have
clearly proved that so far from dream or free association really
being free, they are subject to the iron determinism of uncon-
scious necessity* Distortions of instinctive drives
called com-
plexes inexorably force phantasy to follow a mean and narrow
groove*
MacCurdy's researches on the productions of maniacs revealed
the same iron law hidden beneath apparent spontaneity* The
seemingly
effortless and bewilderingly profuse flow of manic
raving proved, on the careful analysis of stenographic reports
over a long period, to be in fact all determined by some wish
of an
infantile
simplicity*
Once
the
unconscious
law was
revealed, the raving was seen to be simply a few thoughts which
oscillated within the bounds of the crudest symbols*
What is the function of dreamj Freud and Rivers agree that
it
is
physiologically
"'the
guardian of sleep"*
Stimuli
that
might rouse
the
sleeper
to
action—that
is, wake him—are
switched into non-motor channels unless they become impera-
tive* Such stimuli include not merely external stimuli, such as
bells whose sound is woven into the dream, but also internal
stimuli—Spains, hunger, sexual wishes,
all the nascent stirrings
of instinctive desire which make even a dog execute running
movements in his sleep*
Freud also saw that
this
explanation by no means ended
the matter* Granted that dreams enable one to sleep on in spite

IX
THE PSYCHE AND PHANTASY
177
of disturbing
stimuli, why do they take the particular form
they do? Freud showed
that they must take
the form of a
*
phantastic response to the external stimuli* It is a pity he gave
this
general
quality of dreams
the
particular
description of
*'wish-fulfilinent^\ as it has misled his followers and has tended
to separate psycho-analysis from other fields of psychology, such
as behaviourism and gestalt psychology*
Suppose a sleeper has been called* The knock penetrates his
dream; the active response to this would normally take the form
of his getting up* His phantastic response therefore takes the
form of dreaming that he gets up—^an experience most of us
have had* In the same way, if a sleeper is disturbed by hunger
pangs,
his waking response would be to
feed, and therefore
starving explorers dream perpetually of food*
Of course this
is "Vish-fulfilment"', inasmuch as in phan-
tasy one fulfils one^s wish to get up or to feed* But wish-fulfil-
ment is misleading as a general description, because
* 'wish''
is
a term usually used of a consciously formulated aim, and its
use here hides the close kinship of the phantastic response of
dream to the active response of waking life* All the countless
stimuli that move us in daily life to action—sl command, an
incentive, something seen, curiosity, a memorandum, a letter;
a burning sexual desire—^may be called wishes, since plainly we
would
perform
no
action
unless we
had some
instinctive
dynamism inside us to make us do
so* But to use the term
wish-fulfilment" of such actions, or of their phantastic equiva-
lent in dream, gives them a queer and freakish appearance and
leads Freud into
difficulties to explain "unpleasant" dreams
and
"unsatisfying"
dreams*
It
is
a
reflection of his
idealist
subjective approach to the subject-object relations of concrete
life*
Dreams are conscious* Now we have already seen that the
data^of consciousness
are
socially
given,
that man by
lan-
guage,
education
and
social
contacts
finds
his
instinctive
responses conditioned by the common world and the common
ego and given the status of consciousness. Therefore society is
still with man in dream* Even in dream the social ego phantas-
tically fulfils man's desires in the social world*
In the social world man may get up

ILLUSION AND REALITY

response
to
the
appropriate
stimuli*
But
the
conditions
of
association demand that an instinctive desire to strike a certain
man or kiss a certain woman be not gratified* In the
social
world therefore such illegal desire can meet with one of two
alternative
fates,
to which
Freud
has
given
the names
of
^‘repression
' and “sublimation*
If we “repress** the desire, we dismiss it from the conscious
field by an effort of will* Now we already saw that conscious-
ness
corresponded
to
the
“socialisation**
or
adaptation
to
civilisation of instinctive responses* Consequently a desire that
has a conscious dress already has its barbaric nudity clothed; it
is already half-civilised* If such a desire
is so strong that it is
not dismissed hy other interests
(i.e. other instirictive drives)
but requires to be forcibly repressed into the unconscious by an
act of will, then
it* is plain that this very repression strips the
wish of
its
veneer of education and makes
it
barbaric and
savage* Hence the evils of repression, which Freud*s school has
pointed out, are due to the very act which strips them of their
social adaptation and makes them savage prisoners* From diis
barbarising of conscious wishes springs the terrible ferocity of
the
saint, the bitterness of the puritan and the unspeakable
cruelties of a Holy Inquisition*
In sublimation the instincts
are given a
social adaptation
which permits them to
satisfy themselves
in
consciousness*
To
write *a
“strong**
letter,
to
indulge
in
violent
sport or
economic competition,
are ways in which society permits us
to give our instinctive wish a conscious dress* To wrestle with
nature,
to give our hate a
creative material
outlet,
are
still
higher forms of sublimation* To dance, to write love poetry,
to pay the woman we love the compliments of service or speech
are the ways in which we civilise our sex* Thus these instincts,
whose
blind
strength
might make
us
their
blind
slaves,
acknowledge us as their masters and increase our spontaneity,
because they are given a conscious and therefore social adapta-
tion* Here
too freedom
is
seen
to be the
consciousness of
necessity*
But the range of possibility of sublimation,
the width of
consciousness and therefore of spontaneity, is not settled in the
ideal world*
It
is part of the social product and like
all the

IX
THE PSYCHE AND PHANTASY
I79
freedom of society
is generated by labour*
In the past the
majority of consciousness and therefore the greatest range of
sublimation has gone
to« the class which has appropriated the
major
share of the
social
product; and
for
the
other
class,
the
sublimation
of
its
socially-thwarted
desires
for
leisure
and food have taken the crude form of religion and the phan-
tastic structure of a dream paradise*
The
of dream is still the socialised
the instinctive,
unconscious,
genotypical
ego
modified by
contact with
the
common ego* The world of dream is still the world of instinc-
tive
response
to
environment
modified
by
the
common
perceptual world* It is for this reason that as in real life so in
dream the hunger and getting-up urges are gratified by
direct
phantasy—wt dream of eating or dressing—^whereas instincts to
kill or rape other human beings are sublimated
or,
as Freud
puts
it,
''distorted by the censor' ^ Of course as instincts they
are neither to
kill nor
to rape—^since killing and raping are
social conceptions, unknown to the unconscious
instincts of
sex and self-preservation* However, these words must be used
in discussing the unconscious in the terms of the conscious*
The idea of a separate endo-psychic censor
is obviously an
abstraction*
In
fact
this
censor
and
the
distortion
"he"
produces
are not the work of a
special department of the
psyche but
are given
in
the nature of consciousness
itself*
Any neural "^ngram" whose activity forms a part of a dream-
consciousness
must
necessarily
respect
certain
social
laws,
because that very consciousness
is
like a suit of clothes and
a shave—sl sign that it has been civilised*
Why in that
case, do we in dream permit ourselves to do
things we should be ashamed to do in real
life? Two factors
combine
to
produce
this moral
looseness
of dream*
It has
already been remarked that the genotype
is born not merely
a savage but a brute? and hence the development or conscious-
ness is a shaping of the outside, a carving of the intact trunk*
Consciousness
begins
as
self-consciousness,
as
a detachment
of the
self from the environment, but
this alone does not
secure consciousness; it is in a sense opposed to it and merely
instinctive*
It
is only when self-consciousness returns on the
environment and by. experience impresses the environment on

l8o
ILLUSION AND REALITY
IX
itself that
it becomes
conscious
of
reality,
of
^^otherness'**
This is a social process* The baby grows conscious by becoming
interested
in
its
surroundings and
learning about them by
active experience* Because it does so by means of language and
social activity,
its experience of reality is an experience of the
rich complex reality of the common perceptual world* In the
introversion of sleep the environment sinks away and with it
therefore
vanishes much of the
social world of reality* We
tend
to
return
to
the
introversion
of
childhood
and
the
dawning
self-consciousness of infancy,
in which the
is
everything and
external
reality
as
yet
a vague
chaos*
This
explains
not merely
the
archaic and
infantile
character
of
dreams,
but
also
the
extent
to which
their
analysis
reveals
the influence of infantile experience* When we sleep the face
grows
childish*
For the same reason in dream
the Mother,
the return
to
the womb,
incest, and
all
the other
familiar
infantile Freudian motives play an important part* The
of dream, though so important,
is a petty ego, for social
life
is the means of its realisation* The
of dream
is like the
world of dream, only partly socialised* Thus dream is doubly
detached from
reality—external and
internal*
It
is not com-
pletely severed on either side but it is loosened*
It would be wrong to deduce from dream to
life without
allowing for the difference* This difference is the more active
role
in
life
of
the
environment which
in
its
consciously
perceived form is a social construct* We are born a genotype
merely
instinctive* We become self-conscious and, by
inter-
action
with
the environment,
receive an adaptation of the
instincts which
determines
our
infantile
consciousness
and
our
infantile
hopes,
aspirations
and
aims* Our
growth
to
manhood is accompanied by an enrichment of consciousness
that is, by a still more far-reaching adaptation of our childish
desires
to
the environment* Our
adult consciousness
is not
determined by
our
infantile,
any more
than
our
infantile
consciousness is determined by our instinctive genotype* There
is a difference which consists in the diflFerence in experience,
and
> this
experience
rests
on
a
deeper
penetration
of
the
environment
as a result of living in society* We have lived
and therefore are altered* Freudism^ by taking the dream at its

IX
THE PSYCHE AND PHANTASY
i8i
own
valuation,
constantly
dismisses
the adaptations of con-
sciousness
as
fetters
or inhibitions on the
instincts, without
seeing the vital fact that these adaptations are generated by the
struggle of the instincts with the environment* Robbed of these
adaptations the instincts would be so much the less free* To
strip the tortoise or the crab of its shell would not free it but
would
expose
it
to
the
necessity of the
environment*
This
does not of course exclude the possibility of these adaptations
becoming
relatively
cramping—^relative
to
the
freedom
of
other adaptations already made possible by
a change in the
material conditions* For example, the horny integument of the
cactus secures its free development in desert regions, but if it
should
grow
moist,
this
integument
woidd
cramp
its
development and the skin would
either be discarded or the
cactus would be crowded
out by more
thin-fleshed
plants*
This
applies
still
more
powerfully
to man
whose
social
organisation
secures
a
continuous
and
rapid
change
in
his
productive forces*
Thus
the loose character of the dream
is
partly explained
by its infantilism* Our social conditioning is closely associated
with
the
environment,
for
reasons
already
explained* Any
weakening
in
environmental
strength
tends
to
lessen
our
adaptation* We all know how we act differently away from the
home circle, or with friends, or in a foreign country* We know
that the instinctive outburst of rage or the non-social behaviour
of drunkenness are accompanied by a weakening of the reality
of the environment; ^Ve
forgot where we
were''*
In
sleep
introversion robs
the environment of absolute
reality; hence
a corresponding loosening of social coherence, which, however,
cannot vanish
as
long
as
the dream remains
conscious;
yet
conscious it must be to have value, for the instincts, owing to
their
long
conditioning,
cannot
act
except
upon
socially
accepted reality, and all such reality is conscious*
*
Because
of
its
archaic and
instinctive
nature,
the
reality
which makes up the conscious material of dream is crude and
limited as compared with the reality of waking consciousness*
This applies not merely to the external reality which figures
in a 4i^eam as ^"dream thoughts", but to internal reality, the
*T" which experiences them*
It
is a mean, petty and selfish

ILLUSION AND REALITY

We are not conscious of any nobility or heroic quality
in
this
on the contrary,
it never does anything we can
really be proud o£ Even its achievements are gained too easily.
After waking from dream we are only too glad we are not
^Veally like that'\ And in fact we are not, for it is the process
of association which makes men noble and heroic which gives
their
character more
beauty
arid
worth. Hence
the
of
dream, stripped of so much of its social adaptation, is stripped
of its largeness and human value.
Yet we
see phantasy even in the form of dream reaching
out towards an ameliorative role. In dream thd ego experiments
in action upon reality, but
it is now a plastic reality without
the stiffness of material things. In the space of a night it is
possible to combine and recombine,
free from the immediate
tension of a direct contact with reality^ and the limitations
of manipulating real stuff.
It is possible to experiment with new forms of reality more
appropriate to our instincts and to experience in a provisional
way what these forms would feel like and how our instincts
would react to their achievement. Thus the illusion of dream
has
this biological value, that by experimenting ideally with
possible realities and attitudes towards them it paves the way
for such changes in reality. Dream prepares the way for action;
man must
first dream the possible before he can do
it.
It
is
true that the realisation of our dream is never the same as the
dream;
it looks different and it feels different. Yet it also has
something in common with our desire, and its realisation was
only possible because dream went before and lured us on,
as
the harvest festival made possible the harvest. Of course dream
is too archaic and too phantastically isolated from social reality
to be of mych value in the concrete living of civilised man.
The '^remedy'' for the illusory character of dream is not to
abolish dream but to so enlarge and extend it that it becomes
increasingly
close To the realisation
it
is made to anticipate;
1 This plasticity and recombination of psychical elements possible in the
introversion of sleep
is perhaps a reflection of a similar physiological pro-
cess in all the higher cells of die body and therefore the biological "'reason**
for
sleep. In
sleep the
conditioning of the whole body may undergo a
liquidation and digestion such as takes place with' consciousness in dream.

to
fill it more full of life and reality and vivid content* Once
again freedom is extended by an extension of the consciousness
of
necessity*
This programme
calls
for
the
socialisation
of
dream*
4
Imagine,
therefore,
the
first sub-man
leading
his
almost
solitary
life of the
instincts
in
his
nearly
private world of
reality,
dreaming
like
the dog of the
simplest
actions
that
answer
his
desires,
and
faced by
reality with
the need
for
making
that dream more
real, more
full of content, more
useful*
His solution we have already recorded when we dealt with
the birth of poetry* Man made a tremendous stride forward
when he injected the dream into waking life, which forced it
to answer the categories of waking reality*
But
it was
essential that he should do
this without losing
the very quality that made dream useful,
its plasticity* Now
if
consciousness
is
faced
with
the demand
of
completely
coinciding with external reality, it then becomes indistinguish-
able from
perception—^perception
of things round-me-now,
perception of feelings inside-me-now.
Hence
the
joints
of this waking consciousness had to be
somehow loosened* Imagine the *T' located at a point in the
solid crystal of space-time* So far as the
is conscious of its
relations with space-time, they are simply a perceptual glowing
network running from the
out into infinity*
Two ways of
* loosening*^ are possible:
(i) One involves a separation of the subject froni the object*
This
in
itself
gives
rise
to
the
possibility
of two
further
subdivisions
(a) It is possible to concentrate on the reality of feeling-tone,
and dissolve the crystal of external reality* This does not mean
that external reality disappears;
it means that external reality
is manipulated not primarily according to
its own laws but
according
to
instinctive
and
subjective
laws*
Hence
the
plasticity
of dream
is
retained,
but
the waking
reality
of
subjective consciousness
is injected into dream
to enrich
it*

ILLUSION AND REALITY
IX
184
This gives us the
field of the illusory Mock World (but real
common ego), the world of art,
(b) Or
it
is
possible
to concentrate on the
reality of the
object and dissolve the nucleus of internal reality. This does
not mean that the
the observer, disappears; it means that
the
‘T'*
is manipulated not according to its own desires but
according to the necessity of external reality. Once again the
plasticity of dream
is retained, but the reality of the waking
environment
is brought into the world of dream to stiffen
it.
This
gives
us
the
real
perceptual world of the impersonal,
omnipresent, unemotional Mock Ego, the world of science,
(ii) It
is possible, besides separating subject from object, to
separate space from time, like from unlike, and quantity from
quality. This does not mean that space or time disappears,
but that one or the other is the manifold in which distortion
takes place,
(a)
Spatial
organisation
gives us
the
cla§sificatory
sciences
and poetry.
(b) Temporal organisation gives us the evolutionary sciences
and the story.
The
classificatory
sciences,
of which
mathematics
is
the
queen and physics an important sphere,
deal with space-like
orderings which are independent of time. Time enters only as
a homogeneous oscillation in which no new qualities emerge
except that of entropy. This
is the
field of timeless order, of
quality, of mechanical materialism.
The evolutionary sciences, which develop later, are historical
in their approach. They deal with reality as a process,
as the
emergence
of
new
qualities.
Sociology,
biology,
geology,
psychology, astronomy and physiology are
all sciences which
are interested in time, which roam about through time and
therefore abstract by telescoping, condensing and generalising
time, just as the classificatory sciences telescope, condense and
generalise
space.
Obviously
these
fields
penetrate.
Only
mathematics
is
purely
classificatory
and
dialectics
purely
evolutionary. The rise of the evolutionary sciences from 1750
to
1850
was
what
altered
the
mechanical
materialism
of
* Condillac, d'Holbach and Diderot to the dialectical material-
ism of Marx and Engels and made
it capable of including all

the
active
side of the
subject-object
relation
developed
by-
idealism.
The same division in the field of art gives
ris:e to a similar
distinction. In
literary art the novel
is evolutionary and the
poem
is
classificatory. As
this
distinction
is of fundamental
importance,
it must be considered in detail later.
Obviously
the
brute-man
did
not
evolve
these
external-
isations of dream/ as we have done, by taking thought. They
were generated by his struggle with Nature, by the need for
association in that struggle, and by the development of vocal
and
visual symbols which
that
association made
necessary*
The real world discovered with the aid of the mock ego, and
the
real ego
explored by means of the mock world
are the
conscious
world and
the
conscious
ego
and,
therefore,
the
social world and the social ego.
In the dance and the chant man retires into a half-sleep by
dismissing the world of immediate reality. This enables him
to play
fast and loose with the world of external reality,
to
build and unbuild
it. But not arbitrarily and lawlessly—there
would be no point or object in such an occupation. He builds
it according to the laws of the sockl
ego, and he does
this
because in the dance and the chant, while withdrawing from
the world of external
reality,
he maintains touch with
the
subjective world of his fellows by moving his body in rhythm,
by repeating the same words in unison, by weaving between
them an emotional network of common feelings evoked by
socially common
objects,
such
as
notes
of music,
animals
mimicked
jn the
dance, words denoting
socially recognised
entities
or
experiences.
Thus
the
items
of
the common
perceptual
world
are
selected,
organised,
blended
and
re-
orientated round
the
social
ego,
the
**god**
of
early Greek
ritual who
descended
- into
his
worshippers
and who
was
nothing but the symbol of the heightened common ego formed
by the dance.
Of course,
as society develops,
poetry detaches itself from
the
common
festival.
Civilised man
more
easily
secures
physiological introversion—the rhythm of poetry
is sufficient
to
achieve
it—and
the
collective
subjective
significance
of
words keeps him in touch with his fellows without the need

i86
ILLUSION AND REALITY

for that collective festival which has been out-moded by the
division of labour, a division reflected in the wider range and
greater content of language itself.
Such art
is timeless, for man himself is
still timeless,
still
lives entirely in the Now from age to age, with only a fabulous
past and future. This ideal timelessness reflects the fact that
man^s division of labour itself has not extended into time, that
he lives from hand to mouth, that he does not,
like niodern
man, inherit all the capital, the congealed labour, the technique
and cultural achievements of changing generations of men. He
has
only
the
barest
social
relations with
the dead and
the
unborn. A few
tools,
a limited technique and an unwritten
language he has certainly, and this commonness with the past
is reflected in a few time-myths—about heroes and a golden
age and a Prometheus
or Moses,
bringers of knowledge
to
barbarous
men.
But,
in
general, the
timelessness of poetry
matches his own childish simplicity which thinks, like Traherne,
that the wheat was golden and immortal, corn that had never
been sown or reaped.
But as history develops, man's interplay with his changeful
past is reflected in towns^^and temples and states and irrigation
and
finally
in
stories—^in
images
of men's
changing
lives
organised
in time. So a new
art emerges which reaches
its
height—the novel and film—exactly
in
that
era from
1750
onwards when the evolutionary sciences rise to notice. All this
new insight is in turn a product of the terrific historic changes
in Nature made possible by industrialisation.
In the story, man is young and grows old, and we are inter-
ested in watching how in this process of maturing his external
world and his own heart change. This distortion, organisation,
condensation and selection of the subjective contents of the
psyche and
its
real environment
in
gelation
to
a temporal
life-line distinguish the story from the poem.
This in turn reveals the greater sophistication of the novel.
In the undifferentiated tribe it is easily and always possible for
all men to be in one mind in one time in one place, and for
a
universal and
timeless
ego
to emerge from this congress,
speaking for
all with one voice. But the more differentiated
life of modern society
is
contrapuntal; men's
lives blend and

IX
run J>SYCHE AND PHANTASY
187
overlap and
interweave
in
a
complicated
tapestry, And
the
moments rarely arrive when all their minds and emotions are
gathered together in one public universal
Hence the hero
of the novel
is not like
the
**hero’^
of poetry,
a
universal
common
but a real concrete individual.
How is the ""collectiveness"" of the novel assured? It inheres
in the real environment that always figures in the novel—the
realism of the actions, of the other characters, and the events
considered
as one
social plexus. Thus
external
reality,
dis-
missed by introversion from the immediate attention of the
reader,
returns
in another guise—^not
as
reality-now,
not
as
the room in which
""I"" am sitting reading, but as the external
reality which has been or may be; and this
is only possible
precisely because the novel
is plastic in the time dimension.
Hence the immediate reality of the reader
is pushed out or
blanked off by the verisimilitude of the mock world of the
novel, which is therefore much more realistic and factual than
the shimmering, dream-like mock world of poetry.
In
this
the novel resembles
the day-dream. As compared
with the ordinary dream the day-dream has more
reality,
it
remains in the
field of the possible,
it does not contain the
wild extravagances
or abrupt transitions of the dream.
It
is
more orderly and less primitive, and this is necessary because
in the day-dream we are awake and therefore the phantasy has
to
have
this
material
coherence,
this
stiffening
of
objects
ranged in a real order so as to screen out the everyday environ-
ment and draw the mind to it. This quantity of ""matter"" in
the day-dream and the novel makes necessary their temporal
organisation,
because
without
such
an
organisation
the
narrative would become overloaded and confused and would
finally bulk out to coincide with the slow unwieldy movement
of perceptual reality itself—at which point
it would lose
all
value,
or possibility of affective
organisation. Dream by
its
sensory introversion, and poetry by its rhythm and concentra-
tion, escape the need for so great* a stiffening of reality and so
marked an
""organisation""
in time. Theirs
is an organisation
in space.
The day-dream
is characteristically a more ""civilised"" form
of phantasy. It is the expression of man as an individual plastic

ILLUSION AND REALITY
IX
l88
in reality, just as the dream is the expression of reality plastic
in the man* One expresses man^s power over Nature derived
from altering himself: the other man^s power over himself by
altering
Nature*
In
the
day-dream, man
experiments
with
adapting himself to reality; in the dream, with adapting reality
to himself; both these characteristics are carried over into their
respective arts*
Science
in
its
dichotomy
reveals
the same
parentage*
In
the classificatory sciences man does not introvert himself from
present reality by interposing thoughts of another precedent
or subsequent
reality, but by spreading over present reality
categories
derived from himself* This
is
precisely what the
field of order or quantity really
is* Just as man derives from
rhythm certain instinctive commonnesses, so he derives from
perception
certain
perceptual
commonnesses*
Three
cows,
three sticks, three apples, when bare of subjective aspects (the
cow appearing as one thing to one man, the apple as differently
valued to another), yet have a perceptual commonness among
men
which
is
^^threeness'^
number,
quantity*
All
these
qualityless categories of classification, by robbing the present
of its peculiarities, enable man to ^^abstract^^ to blend,
select
and combine all reality in a timeless way* By purging from the
common ego all those qualities which are peculiar to one man
in one
place,
it becomes
possible
to give man a
phantastic
and
flexible grasp of the whole
field of reality* The process
robs
reality
of
the
time
in
it—^the
emergence
of
new
qualities*
It is for that reason that in man^s daily life, counting, the
herdsman^s
science
(India), and geometry,
the
agriculturist's
science
(Egypt), emerge before
the more
qualitied historical
sciences* In a more primitive community men have much the
same experiences in common from day to day, and it is easy
for
them,
meeting
together
in
a
group,
to make
of
their
experience a bundle of world-perspectives from one point of
space-time,
a bundle bare of quality, of feeling-tone—^which
is just what rnathematics
is* It is easy for them to "^abstract"
themselves from those surrounding by abstracting from
the
surroundings all feeling-tone and therefore all quality* Because
they perform tasks in common it is easy for them to abstract

IX
THE PSYCHE AND PHANTASY
189
the commonness in all tasks—the quantitive element in them,
the number of cattle tended, of acres planted*
Thus
dream
becomes
mathematics
when,
for
the
intro-
version of sleep
shutting 6ut
all
sensory
stimuli from
the
environment,
is substituted the introversion of mathematics,
which shuts out all sensory qualities and so is able to extend
its grasp beyond
present
reality
to
all
reality*
In
sleep
the
rhythm of breathing and the flow of blood draw the perceptual
world into the ego; in mathematics the rhythm of breathing
and the flow of blood push the ego into the perceptual world.
It is only later, when civilisation becomes contrapuntal, and
men^s labours, aspirations and aims cross and interweave, that
the evolutionary sciences arise. Here introversion from present
reality
is
secured,
not by
abstracting
* all
quality from con-
sciousness but by substituting an ego whose appreciation of
quality is limited, distorted and organised in time* This mock
ego is not like that of mathematics, the ego gazing everywhere
and nowhere seeing quality, but the ego gazing everywhere yet
seeing only one particular type of quality,
the qualities that
demarcate the particular sphere of science in question* Hence,
with the rise of the evolutionary sciences,
science necessarily
splits up into
diflFerent spheres each with their own distinct
qualities—the
spheres
of
chemistry,
biology,
psychology,
sociology, etc. These spheres do not contradict each other; they
are selections from the one universal movement of qualities
which
is
reality, but which without
this
division of labour
would be beyond man s grasp*
The spheres are not arbitrarily selected, they are determined
by the nature of reality and* of man^s active relation to
it, and
mark his Successive concern with dead nature, with himself as
body, with
his own mind and with the society that
is the
matrix of their mutual relations. Because of the
fullness of
quality even in any one sphere,
it is still necessary to organise'
and condense them in time, just as man organises in retrospect
his own experience—by a condensation, blending and fusing of
the qualities that emerge in this sphere in the process of reality*
Just as the hero of the novel is an individual surrounded by
those very events and persons which will actively call forth the
subjective reactions for which the novel is written, so the hero

ILLUSION AND REALITY

of an
evolutionary
science
is
a
particular sphere of
quality-
observed by
just
that mock
ego
' or
one-sensed man whose
peculiarities of sight will
call forth
the
relations which the
science is evolved to organise and study.
5
This
development
of
art and
science
is
not
the
merely
contemplative discovery of static realities,
it
is part of men s
active
relation with
Nature. The
phantasy
of
art,
by
the
constant changes in organisation which
it produces in man^s
ego,
makes man
conscious
of the
necessity of his
instincts
and therefore free. This is not an absolute freedom but relative
to the means of change—the complex, rich,
social ego against
which man presses his own blind ego in the embrace of art.
This social ego us in turn built up not of ideal stuff but of the
real concrete emotions and aspirations that a man experiences
from living in a real, concrete society.
This is revealed, for example, in the nature of the material
of literary art—^words; the very words that are tools to man
in
his
associated operations, however ordinary;
the language
of court, camp and kitchen.
Science and art are the frontiers of phantasy. They embody
the most abstract, the most general, the most essential laws of
concrete feeling and perception. 'They are ^^pure^' and for that
reason they ^ have
separated out from
each
other. They
are
concerned with
the new,
with
just
those
general items
of
social experience which negate the already existing common ego
and common
perceptual
world,
and
therefore demand
the
extension of both ego and world (new art works, new hypoth-
eses) to include them. This
is the way practice unites with
theory,
because
men's
practical
experience
contradicts
the
already given consciousness of men and demands its modifica-
tion. To those who think mechanically
it«seems as if science
and art are not interpenetrated with living experience but are
opposed to it, because they are the fruit of its contradiction.
Science and art are artificially separated from life when they
are visualised as ideological spheres,
As practice,
as

I9I
known
experience,
they
are
at every step
derived from
the
struggle of man with Nature*
The world of phantasy which
arises
as the
* 'guardian'’ of
slumber
because
in
it man
rests from
the
active
struggle
with Nature, and
in accordance with
his
desires
rearranges
in his body the traces of his struggle, taking the symbol for
the fact—this world, by being introjected into the social world
of waking
reality,
is
forced
to
split and on
the one hand
increasingly tp reflect the necessity of external reality, on the
other hand to take the imprints of men’s hearts* Thus men are
affected by each other’s emotional experiences and experiences
of reality* Men make each other what they are.
The artist and the scientist participate in that manufacture*
They
are men who
acquire
a
special
experience
of
life
affective with the artist, perceputal with the scientist—^which
negates
the common ego
or the common
social world, and
therefore requires a refashioning of these worlds to include the
new
experience. Just
as
the producer of material goods
for
society brings them to the common market, so the artist or
the
scientist brings
his
special
experience
to the ideological
market in a fashioned form*
In
order
that
products
should have
the stamp
of
social
products, of commodities^
they must have been endowed with
a shape which gives them a social use-value* They must have
been fashioned by labour to be denizens of the world of social
utility* In the same way the artist or the scientist must give
his experience a social significance; it must be included in the
ideological world of society*
It
is
precisely
this
fashioning
which constitutes the labour of art or science, and which entitles
the artist or the scientist to regard himself as a producer.
Jung contrasted phantasy, or free association, with "directed
thinking”—thinking which
is forced to follow a "rational”
path,
a path conforming with our
conscious knowledge of
reality* This conscious knowledge, as we have already seen,
is
derived from the common perceptual world* Hence directed
thinking is scientific thinking; by directed thinking we fashion
our experience of external reality into a social product*
To Jung’s conception of directed thinking we wish to add
that of "directed feeling”* This
is what we do whenever we

IX
192
ILLUSION AND REALITY
direct our feelings along lines intended to conform with what
we think right, with our
''true''
self, with the valid or the
beautiful, with what we feel is the better part of us, with the
ideal each has in his breast* Just as directed thinking
is con-
trolled by the reason and acknowledges the social criterion of
truth,
so
directed
feeling
is
controlled
by
the
heart
and
acknowledges the social criterion of beauty or goodness*
It
is the crime of class religion to have separated goodness
from beauty and the conscience from the heart* Religion arises
as mythology, as early poetry in which science and art are still
mingled, for collective phantasy is still no more than collective
dream* Man has not fully separated himself from the environ-
ment,
is not yet conscious of the contradiction between the ego
and the environment, and, because he is not conscious,
is the
slave of that contradiction, blindly tossed hither and thither by
his feelings and events* But when science and art separate out,
religion no longer plays a useful role* It attempts to combine
both; therefore it distorts the truth of science and fetters the
plasticity of art*
We saw that in the realm of science phantasy gained pene-
trative power, gained the ability to reflect more accurately the
environment, because it replaced the real concrete ego with a
mock ego or scaffolding whose flexibility enabled the mould of
phantasy to adhere closely to the environment* But religion still
mixes the subjective with the objective* It announces as truths
what man hopes to be true* Its views of reality are distorted by
man's
affective
drives*
It
takes
poetic
illusions,
valued and
considered true for their subjective content, and demands that
men give them the status of statements symbolic of external
reality* But since man's practical experience proves or disproves
the truth of scientific hypotheses, religion can only protect its
illusions from exposure by making them symbolical of another
world than the material world—the kingdom of heaven,
the
"next world"* Obviously this is a degeneration from primitive
religion which stated, its tenets scientifically, referring them to
the visible material world,
as in the performance of miracles,
die moving of material mountains and so
forth, and whose
errors
therefore,
being
accessible
to
practice, could by their
self-exposure give rise to science*

IX
THE PSYCHE AND PHANTASY
I93
But
class
religion,
by
carefully
protecting
its
symbolical
statements from material test, confines them to a kingdom of
heaven which is either invisibly present behind the real world,
or in more sophisticated forms is simply ''in men s hearts'', ue.
is after
all subjective* In that case religion's truths are simply
symbolical of feeling-tone, and religion thus reduces itself to
art, with this difference, that the very method of its generation
gives
it a dogmatic and amateurish stiffness which is opposed
to the flexibility and technical richness of conscious art—con-
scious
of
its
role,
of
its
materials,
of
its
problems,
of
its
technique and of its traditions*
Thus like all survivals which have had their functions taken
over by other organs, modern religion exhibits the stigmata of
degeneracy* And
as we
have
previously
shown,
its
whole
ideological structure betrays the reasons that have kept it alive,
the same reasons that have kept alive the monarchy, the aris-
tocracy,
feudal
privilege and
similar non-functional
relics
the
special
conditions
and
ossifications
of
a
class
society
protecting obsolete privileges*
The confusion of religion—a confusion between subject and
object—reflects a society which has itself become confused by a
divorce between the active relation of subject and object which
alone procures the separation of each by a mutually reflexive
movement* In a society where consciousness (the subject) has
become separated from the environment (the object) because
the
thinking
class has become
separated from
the working
class,
there
is not possible that constant correction of men's
ideological image of reality by practice which secures the health
and movement of science*
Science, which adheres
closely
to
reality by active experiment in its particular spheres, cannot be
integrated
into
the
universal
"philosophy"
of a
class,
but
decomposes into a chaos of highly specialised, mutually con-
tradictory
.sciences
whose
separation
impoverishes
thought*
Even a scientist has as a rule an unscientific world-view* It
is
therefore possible for a subjectively distorted picture of reality
to arise and be, because of this cleavage, immune from correc-
tion by action* The slaves may know blindly they are not free-
and God is not good—but how are their masters to share
their
experiences? And in the same way the growth of another world,

not this material world but painted in glowing affective colours,
is generated by the misery of the material world endured by
the suffering class, for which they are compensated by future
delights* Hence arises the inverted world of religion, inverted
because the world of society
is
inverted* These two
factors
combine to maintain religion at a time when the development
of science and
art have replaced
it by keener
tools—by the
conscious illusion of art, by the impersonal truth of science, and
the richer concrete living these two make possible*
Thus phantasy develops as the inseparable accompaniment of
action, which creates
it and which
it in turn anticipates and
calls
into
being
in
a
richer
form* And
practice,
enriched,
corrects phantasy's anticipation and makes possible a new level
of achievement* Thus phantasy adapts man
in two ways
his instincts to the ego of society, and his perception to the
perception of society* This adaptation ennobles and heightens
and makes free the dumb brute of the genotype, because the
ego of society and the perception of society is infinitely more
penetrating and rich and complex than that of the unaided
individual, just as man in association is more powerful against
Nature than solitary man*
All
thought,
all
feeling,
reflects
in
some
measure
the
categories of science or art* Science and art are generated in our
daily existence* Scientific systems and art works are merely the
highest forms of organisation, the essence of this daily concrete
life*
Science and
art become
practical^
they
enter
into
concrete
real
life,
directly we knock away the mock world from any
artistic construction and substitute a real world, or knock away
the mock impersonal ego from any scientific construction and
substitute a real human being* In the
first
case we give an
''unattached" human
desire
a
real
materialisation;
in
the
second we give a part of reality the shape of an. answer
to
human desire* Thus, in entering into real concrete life, artistic
and
scientific
constructions become,
as
it were,
blended
or
"impure",
special
instead
of
general,
concrete
instead
of
abstract, and the language we use to make this possible belongs
to the realm of persuasion—the ordinary language of daily life,
removed from the pure and "impractical" worlds of science

and art. We must not regret this forced descent. Science and
art were made for man, not man for science and art. But there
is more to it than that. Science and art were made jfrom man,
not man from science and art* This issuing of science and art
into real ^^impure"' life-experience is what corrects, refines and
develops them,
so
that they return
to
their heavens
wiser,
richer, still more abstract and pure as a result of their incarna-
tion in
life. And though so
ethereal now, science and art in
their infancy were as concrete as concrete living.
This phantasy,
generated by association for economic pro-
duction,
is
communicated
by
material
symbols—^gestures,
sounds,
drawings,
touches.
Because
of the
nature
of man's
senses, sound proved at first the favoured sense, leaving men's
eyes free to con the external environment. The division of labour,
which no
longer made
all men concerned at the same time
with the environment, again restored advantages to sight and
the
sounds
became
visual
symbols—^writing.
Language
developed
as
the
favoured
tool
for
the communication of
phantasy, superior to diagrams or '^picture writing". Ignorance
of this concrete function of ‘language and concentration on its
formal aspects make many philosophers approach language
in
a strangely patronising way.
They find it '^imperfect", deviating from the ideal language,
and
illogical—^rather
as
a
biologist might study
species and
reproach them
for
their departure from some
ideal animal.
Such
philosophers
think
consciousness
is
contemplation—
a
limpid image of reality. In the same way they think language
• exists to be a passive photograph of the universe, Wittgenstein's
Tractatus Logio-Philosophicus is entirely based on this assumption.
This
is the error of philistines who imagine that a painting
must be exactly like the scene it pororays. They do not see that
it
is
a
silly
task
to make an
exact copy of something we
already have, and that the relation of language and thought to
reality is not a passive reflection but an active and tendencious
reaction, and that it is this activity and tendenciousness which
enables a mere reaction to become conscious and know. The
mirror reflects accurately:
it does not know. Each particle of
the Universe reflects the rest of the Universe, but knowledge is
only given to human beings as a result of an active and social

relation
to
the
rest
of
reality*
Knowledge
is
an
economic
phrases
the
Wittgenstein
conception
thus:
^"The
essential business of a language is to assert or deny facts' \ But
this
is not a business at alL Facts assert or deny themselves:
that is* they either exist or do not* A man sees them in external
reality or does not* He remains dumb* The business of language,
as an extension of life, is to decide what facts are worth assert-
ing or denying: what facts exist for men and what do not* It
is the business of language to be the best possible
tool
for
siting
facts
in an
ordered world-view, which can
select
or
condense or classify them hierarchically; and into such a world-
view the subject must enter* Society must appear twice, as ego
and world, and in both cases dragging its material history after
it* Russell's view of language is like that of the gushing lady
who said to Carlyle,
accept the Universe"* But man does
not accept the Universe, for the Universe does not accept him*
He must change it under penalty of extinction* And he can only
change it in association; therefore language reflects the relations
of men as feeling men and perceiving men in association for
economic production*
This historical function of language explains why existing
languages are so far from the
^ ^perfect" language postulated by
Wittgenstein* Such a perfect language would be perfectly use-
less* It would be a picture of the world, standing in the same
relation
to
external
reality
as
a mirror-image
to
the
thing
mirrored* But then it would be an inferior thing to the thing
imaged, and would be a useless construct* It would have no
*
hidden power over the world or the
subject*
It
is
precisely
because language expresses
feeling,
is a judging as well
as a
picturing of parts
of
reality,
that
it
is
valuable*
Language
expresses not merely what reality is (what reality is stares man
in the face) it expresses also what can be done with reality—its
inner hidden laws, and what man wants to do with it—^his own
unconscious
necessities*
Language
is a
tool
to
express what
reality
is in relation to man—^not abstract man but concrete
human beings*
Is
it not plain that the error of the philosophers regarding
language
springs
from
the
same
source
as
religion—the
product*

cleavage of the subject from the object in a class society? Then
thought comes
to seem merely contemplation and
is cut off
from the very activity which creates, develops and corrects
it.
Language, and the phantasy which has generated
it, and the
conscious psyche which is their offspring, and the man whose
straggle with Nature in association has created
all three,
are
bound together with a relation which Marx was the
first to
express in those hastily-scribbled eleven Theses on Feuerbach that
marked the beginning of a new era in human thought: “The
philosophers have only
interpreted the world in various ways;
the point, however,
is to change it”

POETRY^S DREAM-WORK
I
In an earlier chapter we stated that modern poetry was com-
posed
of
words,
was
non-symbolical,
irrational,
concrete,
characterised by condensed aflFect, and rhythmical. Investigating
dream we found that as compared with other forms of phantasy
it also was non-symbolical, and irrational. Poetry is composed
of words;
dream
is
composed
of memory-images.
Dream-
images do not follow rational laws drawn from external reality,
but,
as psycho-analysis shows, the flow of images is explained
by affective laws.
Dream is neither directed thinking nor directed feeling, but
free—that is non-social—^association. Hence the associations of
dream are personal and can only be' understood by reference to
the dreamer's personal life. The secret law of dream's structure
is the ^'dream-work".
Poetic irrationality bears this resemblance to dream, that its
flow of images
is explained by
affective laws; but
it
is not
"free"
association
as
in
dream.
Poetic
feeling
is
directed
feeling—^feeling controlled by the social ego. Poetic associations
are social.
As the dreamer lives
entirely in the images of his dream,
without reference to another reality,
so the reader of poetry
lives
in the words of the
poetry,
without
reference
to
the
external world. The poet's world is his world. As he reads the
poem he feels the emotions of the poet. Just as the pythoness
or bacchante speaks
for the god in
the
first- person,
so .the
reader under the influence of poetic illusion feels for the poet
in the first person.
The images of dream, like the ideas of poetry, are concrete.
In each dream, and in each poem, the memory-image and the
word play a different part, and therefore have different mean-
ings. Dreams and poems
are inconsistent among themselves.
Each dream and eadi poem is a world of its own.

X
poetry's dream-work
199
Poetry
is
rhythmical. Rhythm
secures
the heightening of
physiological consciousness so as to shut out sensory perception
of the environment. In the rhythm of dance^ music or song
we become self-conscions instead of conscious. The rhythm of
heart-beat and breathing and physiological periodicity negates
the physical rhythm of the environment. In this sense sleep too
is rhythmical. The dreamer retires into the citadel of the body
and closes the doors.
Why is ^^physiological" introversion more necessary in poetry
than in story, so that the poet accepts the difficulties of metre
and rhyme? The answer
is that introversion must be stronger
in poetry. By introversion is not meant merely a turning-away
from immediate environment—that could be secured by sitting
in
a
quiet study,
without disturbance. Such
introversion
is
equally desirable for all kinds of thought, for scientific think-
ing and novel-reading as well as poetry, and it is not secured by
the order of the words but by an effort of concentration. Some
people can
' ^concentrate" on a difficult scientific book or a book
of poetry
in
conditions where
others
cannot. This kind of
introversion does not therefore depend upon the order of the
words. No one has suggested facilitating scientific writing by
making it metrical.
But there
is another aspect of introversion. In introversion
for
scientific
phantasy
it
is
true
that we
turn away from
immediate environment,
yet none the
less we turn towards
those parts of external reality of which the words are symbols.
Ordinarily we
see,
hovering behind language,
the world of
external reality it describes.“ But in poetry the thoughts are to
be directed on to the feeling-tone of the words themselves.
Attention must
sink
below
the
pieces
of
external
reality
symbolised by the poetry, down into the emotional underworld
adhering to those pieces. In poetry we must penetrate behind
the dome of many-coloured glass into the white radiance of the
self. Hence the need for a physiological introversion, which is
a turning-away not from the immediate environment of the
reader hut from the environment (or external reality)
depicted in
the
poem. Hence poetry in its use of language continually distorts
and denies the structure of reality to ex^t the structure of the
self. By means of rhyme, assonance or alliteration
it couples

200
ILLUSION AND REALITY

together words which have no rational connection, that
is, no
nexus through the world of external reality'. It breaks the words
up into
lines of arbitrary length,
cutting across their logical
construction.
It breaks down their associations, derived from
the world of external reality, by means of inversion and every
variety of artificial stressing and counterpoint*
Thus the world of external reality recedes, and the world of
instinct, the affective emotional linkage behind the words, rises
to the view and becomes the world of reality* The subject
emerges from the object: the social ego from the social world*
Wordsworth
said
correctly:
^^The
tendency
of metre
is
to
divest language, in a certain degree, of its reality, and thus to
throw a soft of half-consciousness of unsubstantial
existence
over
the whole
composition" ^
In
the same way
Coleridge
reached out after a like conception to ours: ^^Metre
is simply
a stimulant of attention""—not of any attention but a special
kind of attention—attention to the affective associations of the
words themselves*
We have here a distinction between poetry and the novel
which
it
is
vital
to
grasp*
In
the novel
too
the
subjective
elements ate valued for themselves and rise to view, but in a
different way* The novel blots out external reality by substitu-
ting a more or less consistent mock reality which has sufficient
^^stuff"" to stand between reader and reality* This means that
in the novel the emotional associations attach not to the words
but to the moving current of mock reality symbolised by the
words* That
is why rhythm,
''preciousness"",
and
style
are
alien to the novel; why the novel translates so well; why novels
are not composed of words* They
are composed of scenes,
actions, sti^^ people, just as plays are* A "jewelled"" style is a
^
disadvantage, to the novel because it distracts the eye from the
things and people to the words—^not as words, as black outlines,
.
but as symbols to which a variety of feeling-tone
is
directly
attached* For example when someone exclaims
"Brute!"" we
do not think of animals and then of brutish qualities, but have
a powerful subjective reaction suggesting cruelty and clumsi-
ness* This
is a poetic reaction to a word; the other
is a story
reaction*
Because
words
are
few
they
are
what
Freud
called

X
poetry's dream-work
201
^^over-determined"* One word has many affective associations
because
it has many
^^meanings"
{e.g. the word "brute"
can
mean a foolish person,
a cruel person, the order of animals,
etc*)* In novel-writing the words are arranged so that all other
pieces of reality are excluded except the piece required, and
the emotional association
is to the resulting structure* Poetic
writing
is concerned with making the emotional associations
either exclude or reinforce each other, without a prior reference
to a coherent piece of reality, e.g. in novel-writing, in the phrase
"the Indian Ocean" the word "ocean" has been restricted to
a specific geographical ocean, which then has emotional associa-
tions for the reader* In poetry "the Indian sea" has a different
meaning, for the emotional associations are, not to a particular
sea but
to
the word "Indian" and the word
"sea", which
affect
each
other and
blend
to
produce
a glowing
cloudy
"feeling" quite different from the novel-writer's phrase*
Of course there may be stretches of poetic writing in a novel
(for example in Proust, Malraux, Lawrence and Melville) or of
novel-writing
in
poetry
(the
purely
explanatory
patches
in
Shakespeare's
plays),
but
this
does
not
affect
the
general
characteristics* The difference is so marked that it explains the
strange
insensitivity
to
poetry
displayed by
so many
great
novelists, and a similar fondness for bad novels on the part of
so many great poets* This difference between the technique
of poetry and the novel determines the difference between the
spheres of the two arts*
2
What is the basis of literary art? What is the inner contra-
diction which produces
its onward movement?
Evidently
it
can only be a special form of the contradiction which produces
the whole movement of society, the contradiction between the
instincts and the environment, the endless
struggle between
man and Nature which is life*
I, the
artist, have a certain consciousness, moulded by my
social world* As
artist I am concerned with my artistic con-
sciousness, represented by the direct and indirect effect on me
of all the art I have
felt, and
all the emotional organisation

20Z
ILLUSION AND REALITY
X
which has produced in me a conscious subject* This conscious-
ness
is contradicted by my experience
tha.t
is,
I have a
ntvo
personal experience, something not given in the social world of
poetry* Therefore I desire ^hat is called self-expression but is
really self-socialisation, the casting of my private experience in
such a form that it will be incorporated in the social world of
art and appear
as an art-work* The art-work represents the
negation of the negation—the synthesis between the existing
world of art (existing consciousness or theory) and my experi-
ence (life or practice)*
Therefore at the finish the world of art will be changed by
the incursion of my art-work* That is the revolutionary aspect
of my role as artist* But also my consciousness will be changed
because
I have, through the medium of the art world, forced
my life experience, new, dumb and unformulated, to become
conscious, to enter my conscious sphere* That is the adaptative
aspect of my r61e as artist* In the same way with the appre-
ciator of art,
his consciousness will be revolutionised by the
incursion into
it of a new art-work; but his appreciation of it
will
only be
possible
to
the
extent
that he
has had some
similar experience in life* The former process will be revolu-
tionary; the latter adaptative*
Rather than use the word revolutionary, however,
it would
be better to use the word evolutionary, restricting the other to
cases where the new content of experience is so opposed to the
existing consciousness that
it requires a wholesale
change,
a
complete revision of existing categories (conventions, traditions,
artistic standards) for
its inclusion, a revision which
is only
possible because concrete
life
itself has undergone a similar
change in the period* The Elizabethan age was one of such
periods. We are at the beginning of another such now*
It is plain that it is the emotional consciousness—that con-
sciousness which
springs
directly from
the
instincts—^with
which the
artist
is concerned* Yet exactly the same relation
holds between the scientist and his hypothesis (equivalent of
the art-work) and the rational consciousness, that consciousness
which springs directly from the perception*
Since the mediating factor in art processes is the social ego
in its relation to the experience of individuals,
it is plain that

X
poetry's dream-work
203
the integration performed hy the art-work can only be achieved
on
condition
that
the item
of private
experience which
is
integrated
(a)
is
important^
concerned
with
deep
emotional
drives,
with
the unchanging
instincts
which,
because
they
remain the same beneath the changing adaptations of culture,
act as the skeleton, the main organising force in the social ego
which ages of art have built up;
(h) is general,
is not a contra-
dictory item of experience peculiar to the artist or one or two
men, but
is encountered in a dumb unconscious way in the
experiences of most men—otherwise how could the art-work
be
meaningful
to
them, how
could
it
integrate and
give
expression
to
their
hitherto
anarchic
experience
as
it gave
expression to the artist's?
Condition
(a) secures that great art—^art which performs
a
wide and deep
feat of integration—^has something universal,
something timeless and enduring j&rom age to age* This time-
lessness we now see to be the timelessness of the instincts,' the
unchanging secret face of the genotype which persists beneath
all
the
rich
superstructure
of
civilisation*
Condition
(b)
explains why
contemporary
art
has
a
special
and
striking
meaning for us, why we find in even minor contemporary poets
something vital and immediate not
to be found in Homer,
Dante or Shakespeare* They live in the same world and meet
the same bodiless forces whose power they experience*
This
also
explains why
it
is
correct to have a materialist
approach
to
art,
to look in the art-works of any age
for
a
reflection of the social relations of that age* For the experience
of men in general is determined in general by the social relations
of
that
age,
or
to
be more
accurate,
the
social
relations
of that age are simply man's individual experiences averaged
out, just as a species is a group of animals' physical peculiarities
averaged out* Since art lives in the social world, and can only
be of value in integrating experiences general to men,
it
is
plain
that the
art of any age can only
express
the
general
experiences of men in that age* So far from the artist's being a
lone wolf, he is the normal man of that age—in so far as he is
an
artist* Of course normality in consciousness
is
as rare
as
normality in vision,
and,
unlike the latter,
it
is not a fixed
physical
standard but one which
varies from
year
to
year*

ILLUSION AND REALITY
X
204
Moreover his normality is, so to speak, the norm of abnormal
experiences* It
is the norm .of the queerness and newness and
accident in contemporary men^s lives: all the incursions of the
unexpected which shake their inherited consciousness* Hence
the apparent abnormality of the artist*
This,
finally, explains why in a class society art is class art*
For a
class, in the Marxian sense,
is simply a group of men
whose
life-experiences
are substantially similar, that
is, with
less internal differences on the average than they have external
differences froni the life-experiences of men in other
classes*
This
difference of course has an economic
basis,
a material
cause arising from the inevitable conditions of economic pro-
duction* Therefore the artist will necessarily integrate the new
experience and voice the
consciousness of that group whose
experience in general resembles his own—^his own
class* This
will be the class which practises
art—the class at whose pole
gathers the freedom and consciousness of society, in all ages the
ruling class*
This
is the most general movement of literary art, reflecting
the most
general
law
of
society*
Because
of the
different
techniques of poetry and the novel—already explained—this
movement is expressed in different ways in poetry and in the
novel*
Poetry concentrates on the immediate affective associations
of the word,
instead of going
first
to
the
object or
entity
symbolised by the word and then drawing the affective associa-
tion from
that*
Since words are fewer than the objects they
symbolise, the affects of poetry are correspondingly condensed,
but poetry itself is correspondingly cloudy and ambiguous. This
ambiguity, which Empson takes to be the essence of poetry,
is
in
fact
a
by-product* Now
this
concentration upon
the
affective tones of words, instead of going first to the symbolised
reality and then to the feeling-tone of that reality, is—because
of the nature of language
a. concentration on the more dumb
and instinctive part of man's consciousness* It is an approach
to the more instinctively common part of man's consciousness*
It is an approach to the secret unchanging core of the genotype
in
adapted
man*
Hence
the
importance
of
physiological
introversion in poetry*

X
poetry's dream-work
205
This
genotype
is
undifferentiated
because
it
is
relatively
unchanging* Hence the timelessness of poetry as compared to
the importance of time sequence in the novel* Poetry speaks
timelessly for one common "T' round which all experience is
orientated* In poetry all the emotional experiences of men are
arranged round the instincts, round the ‘1"* Poetry is a bundle
of
instinctive
perspectives
of
reality
taken from
one
spot*
Precisely because
it is cloudy and ambiguous,
its view
is far-
reaching;
its horizon seems
to open and expand and stretch
out to dim infinity* Because it is instinctive,
it is enduring* In
it the instincts give one loud cry, a cry which expresses what is
common in the general relation of every man to contemporary
life as a whole.
But the novel goes out first to reality to draw its subjective
associations from
it. Hence we do not seem to feel the novel
'fin us", we do not identify our feelings with the feeling-tones
of the novel* We stand inside the mock world of the novel and
survey it; at the most we identify ourselves with the hero and
look round with him at the "otherness" of his environment*
The novel does not express
the general tension between th^
instincts
and
the
surroundings,
but the changes
of tension
which take place as a result of change in the surroundings (life-
experience). This incursion of the time element (reality as
a
process) so necessary in a diflFerentiated society where men's
time-experiences
differ markedly among
themselves,
means
that the novel must particularise and have characters whose
actions
and
feelings
are
surveyed from
without*
Poetry
is
internal—a bundle of "I" perspectives of the world taken from
one point, the poet* The story is external
a. bundle of perspec-
tives of one "I" (the character)' taken from different parts of
the world.
Obviously
the novel
can
only
evolve
in a
society where
men's experiences do differ so markedly among themselves as
to make this objective approach necessary, and this difference
of experience
is itself the result of rapid change in society, of
an
increased
differentiation
of
functions,
of an
increased
realisation of life as process, as dialectic* Poetry is the product
of a tribe, where life flows on without much change between
youth and age; the novel belongs to a restless age where things

are always happening to people and people therefore are always
altering*
3
Yet
all art
is subjective. All art is emotional and therefore
concerned with the
instincts whose adaptation to
social
life
produces emotional consciousness. Hence art cannot escape its
close relation with the genotype whose secret desires link in one
endless series all human culture.
Now this genotype can be considered from two aspects; the
timeless and the timeful,
the changeless and changeful,
the
general and the particular.
(^i) Timeless,
changeless,
general in
that on the whole the
genotype is substantially constant in all societies and all men.
There is a substratum of likeness. Man does not change from
Athenian to Ancient Briton and then to Londoner by innate
differences stamped in by natural selection, but by acquired
changes
derived from
social
evolution.
Poetry
expresses
this
constant instinctive factor.
(1) Yet beneath this likeness the genotypes, because they are
bundles of genes, reveal individual differences. These genes are
perpetually shuffled to reveal new personalities. Because men
differ in this way among themselves they cannot be satisfied
with
the
simple
tribal
life
of
collective
civilisation. They
demand ‘duxuries^^ freedom,
special products which cannot
be
satisfied within the ambit of such a primitive economy.
This leads to an economic differentiation of society which,
as
we have already explained,
is not the means of suppressing
individuality but of realising it. Hence these individual genetic
differences produce change in time and also the realisation of
characters
j
of man^s deviation from the social ^'norm'L Thus the
very technique of the novel makes
it interested in the way
characters
strive to realise in existing society their individual
differences.
Poetry expresses the freedom which inheres in man's general
timeless unity in society; it is interested in society as the sum
and guardian of common instinctive tendencies;
it speaks of
death,
love,
hope, sorrow and despair as
all men experience

X
POETRY*S DREAM-WORK
207
them* The novel is the expression of that freedom which men
seek, not in their unity in society but in their differences, of
their search for freedom in the pores of society, and therefore
of their repulsions from,
clashes with and concrete motions
against other individuals different from themselves*
The novel was bound to develop therefore under capitalism,
whose increase in the productive forces brought about by the
division of labour not only vastly increased the differentiation
of society but also, by continually revolutionising its own basis,
produced
an
endless
flux
and
change
in
life*
Equally,
as
capitalism decayed, the novel was bound to voice the experi-
ence of men that economic differentiation had changed from a
means of freedom to a rubber-stamp crushing individuality (the
ossification of classes), and that the productive forces, by being
held back from developing further, had choked the free move-
ment of life (the general economic crisis)* Necessarily therefore
in such a period the decay of the novel occurs together with a
general revolutionary turmoil*
Thus we see in the technical differences of poetry and the
novel
the
difference
between
changelessness
and
change,
space and time, and
it
is
clear that these
are not mutually
exclusive opposites but
are
opposites
which
interpenetrate,
and,
as
they
fly
apart,
continually
generate an enrichening
reality*
This was the same kind of difference
as that between the
evolutionary
and
classificatory
sciences*
And
just
as
the
technique of poetry demands an immediate concentration on
the word, so the classificatory sciences, such as geometry and
mathematics,
demand
an
immediate
concentration
on
the
symbol* The novel demands that we pass from the symbol to
reality, and only then
to the
affective
organisation;- biology
demands that we go first to the concrete objects, and only then
to their rational organisation* Poetry passes straight from the
word to the affective organisation, careless of the reality whose
relation it accepts as already given in the word* Mathematics
passes straight from the symbol to the perceptual organisation,
careless of the concrete object, whose important qualities (to it)
are already accepted as crystallised in the symbol* Hence the
vital importance of precise speech—of the absolutely correct

word or correct symbol—^both to poet and mathematician, con-
trasted with the looser speech permitted
to the biologist or
novelist*
We have seen that music is an extreme kind of poetry, that
just
as mathematics escapes almost altogether from the sub-
jective
qualities
of matter,
so music (unlike poetry) escapes
almost
altogether from
the
objective
references
of sounds*
Therefore the musician
is even preciser in his language than
the
poet, and the
affective laws
of music's symbols
are
as
careful and minute as are the perceptual laws of mathematical
symbols*
We can now understand more clearly why poetry resembles
dream in its technique* The characteristic of dreams is that the
dreamer
always
plays
the
leading part
in
it* He
is
always
present in it, sometimes (as analysis shows) in many disguises*
The
same
egocentricity
is
characteristic
of
poetry*
Quite
naively the poet records
directly
all his impressions,
experi-
ences, thoughts, images* Hence the apparent egoism of poetry,
for everything
is
seen and experienced
directly*
Poetry
is
a
relationship of memory-images mediated by only two words
and
^W*
But this is not the egoism of dream; it is a social egoism* The
particular emotional organisation of the poet is condensed into
words, and the words are read, and the psyche of the reader
experiences the same emotional reorganisation* The reader puts
himself, for the duration of the poem, in the place of the poet,
and sees with his eyes* He
is the poet*
In a poem by Shelley, we are Shelley* As we read Shakespeare,
we see with his profound shimmering vision* Hence the un-
expected individuality of the poet* Though it
is the common
human creature, the genotype, and not the
* ^character" who
looks out in poetry on the common contemporary scene, he
looks at it through the eyes of one man, through the windows
of the poet's psyche*
How
is
this done? That
is
the
peculiar
secret of poetic
technique* Just as poetry can be equated with dream,
poetic
technique is similar to dream technique* The nature of dream
technique has been explored by analysts under the general name
of
4team-work^^

X
poetry's dream-work
209
A dream consists of two layers^ Obvious is the manifest con-
tent* We are walking by the seaside, a ship comes alongside,
we step on
it, we land in France, certain adventures befall us,
and so on. This is the manifest content of the dream as we tell
it 'at breakfast next morning to our bored family, who cannot
understand our interest in
it. But our interest in
it was due
to the
fact that the
illusion was perfect. While they lasted,
these things
really seemed to be happening to
us. And
this
vividness must spring from some affective cause. But we felt
little
real
emotion
in
the
dream,
however
surprising
the
adventures that befell us. If we felt emotion,
it was out of all
real proportion to our adventures. Surprising things happened
and we were not surprised. Trifling things happened and we
were appalled. The affects were displaced in relation to reality.
If we are asked to give our associations to these various com-
ponent images just as they spring to our mind, a whole under-
growth of displaced affective life
is revealed. Each symbol
is
associated with memories
in our
life,
not by association of
ideas but by affective associations.
The
characteristic of ^^dream-work"
is
that
every dream-
symbol
is over-determined and has a multitude of different
emotional significances. This we also saw was the characteristic
of poetic words, and springs from the same cause, that dream-
symbols
are valued directly
for
their
affective
content
and
not
as
symbols
of a
consistent mock world
in
which we
first
orientate
ourselves.
Hence
the
inconsequence
of
dream
matches
the
'^illogical"
rhythm
and
assonance
of
poetry.
The organisation
of* the psyche is such that in sleep all the
conscious
wishes,
hopes,
fears and
loves
of the
instinctive
are replaced by apparently arbitrary memory-images, but which
really are associated by the affective ties of simple unconscious
wishes. They are organised by the appetitive activity of the
instinctive and therefore unsleeping part of the psyche which,
because it is archaic phylogenetically,
is unmodified and there-
fore anti-social, or rather non-social. This affective substratum
does not normally appear in dream. It is
* ^repressed". Only the
arbitrary symbols, apparently unconnected, appear in the con-
sciousness.. But this affective basis
is the '^reasoning" of the
o

210
ILLUSION AND REALITY
X
dream, and directs its course* It is the latent content* But the
affects also have a '^reason'"' for their relation to the memory-
images of the dream* Thus
there
is a double
distortion—
a
distortion of reality and of emotion—a double shift of subject
and object*
Why cannot we achieve in sleep complete unconsciousness to
any stimuli? For the simple reason that sleep
is not death or
complete unconsciousness but something in which part of our
attention is still awake* In sleep attention, though turned from
the outside world,
is not completely asleep, otherwise external
stimuli would never wake us at all* The attention of a sleeper
can be attracted by a sufficiently loud noise* Obviously
it
is
dangerous
for animals
to
sleep
too profoundly*
All
stimuli
below the threshold, ^*|* gentle outside noises, sunlight falling
on the face, pressure on the limbs,
internal digestive disturb-
ances, are switched, not into their proper neurone paths, but
into
other paths
dictated by the
*^sets*^ of the unconscious
instincts*
The reality of an unconscious wish can be tested in practice*
If a sleeper resolves before sleeping to hold a certain object in
his hand, he will still be clutching it when he wakes, showing
that
throughout
his
sleep
some
unsleeping
neurones
con-
tinued to will unconsciously, and to send a continual stream of
nervous impulses down the
efferent
nerves
to the fingers to
maintain a muscular tetany* If the affects were to be wakened
by such stimuli,
sleep would end* Therefore the
associative
paths from the instinctive unconscious neurones to the affective
patterns
are
in some way
side-tracked and
the
stimuli
are
switched instead into the patterns associated at one remove,
ue,
the
memory-images*
These
are
connected with
these
side-
tracked
affective patterns by
association,, but are not them-
selves soaked with affects* These memory-images appear, in the
dream and thus give the flicker of attention something to focus
on, which otherwise would be focused on the stimuli and so
would wake the sleeper*
It
is no accident that sleep appears
only in higher animiis—those whose
life
is
full of acquired
adaptations which therefore require "Vorking out'* physiologi-
cally in sleep* Insects, with their elaborate innate adaptations,
do not sleep* Or when they do ^^sleep", as in the chrysalis,
it

X
211
poetry's dream-work
is
a
final and far more thoroughgoing adaptation,
in which
every cell in the body is re-orientated*
The
emotional
organisation of the memory-images—their
latent
content—is
therefore
given by
the
process
of
their
generation*
If a
certain
threshold
value
is
exceeded by the
stimuli,
or
anything
goes
wrong
with
the
switching,
too
powerful affects are released; the sleeper, becoming more con-
scious, at once wakes* The lack of affective reality accounts for
the ease with which dreams are forgotten, whereas nightmares,
in which the
sleeper wakes
or almost wakes owing
to
the
powerful
affects, "are generally clearly remembered* We wake
because the affects were on the point of becoming realised and
therefore of leading to action*
Dreams, then, contain a manifest and a latent content* The
manifest
content
is
imagic
phantasy,
the
latent
content
is
affective reality* Both have a double connection with a phan-
tastic affectivity manifest in dream and an imagic reality con-
nected with the latent content* Psycho-analysts have not made
this distinction because the analysis of dreams is done verbally*
They have not seen that in translating images and affects into
language there is an epistemological leak* In language images
and affects live simultaneously and cannot be separated: both
are
social and
conscious*
Ignoring
this,
the
psycho-analyst
meets a contradiction: in probing the latent content of dreams
he can never be given by the dreamer a bundle of ^^unconscious"
affects as associations, for the dreamer can only communicate by
language,
and
in
language
affect
is
always
attached
to
an
image, to a symbol of external reality, and is itself a conscious
feeling-tone* Therefore the analyst gets as the latent content of
the dream-images—still more images with
conscious
affects
attached* For this reason, not only does the psycho-analyst tend
to equate unconscious affects with .their social translations, but
he overlooks the gap between dream,
in which the affective
organisation 's unconscious and therefore personal
and art, in
which
the
affective
organisation
' is
conscious and
therefore
sociaL It is the difference between free association and directed
feeling*

This leads to surrealiste technique with its undirected feeling
and personal
affective
organisation,
where
freedom,
in
true
bourgeois style,
is the unconsciousness of necessity,
i.e. ignor-
ance of the affective organisation which determines the flow
of imagery and is conscious in good poetry Hence the cerebral
and visual character of surrealiste art. This bourgeois freedom
was already contained in the philosophy of symbolism, from
which surrealisme derives. Remy de Gourmont, the philosopher
of symbolism,
correctly
said:
Above
all
it
is
a
theory
of
liberty; it implies absolute freedom of thought and form: it is the
free and individual' development of the aesthetic personality"*.
And Rimbaud, greatest of the symbolist poets,
said: '1 have
come to hold sacred the disorder of my mind^".
Poetry,
like
dream,
contains
manifest and
latent
contents.
The manifest content can be roughly arrived at by paraphrasing
the poem. It is the imagery or the ^^ideas"". In a paraphrase the
latent content,
ue. the emotional content, has almost entirely
vanished.
It was contained,
then, not in the external
reality
symbolised by the words (for this has been preserved) but in
the words
themselves. The manifest
content
is
the
poetry
interpreted
^ Nationally"". It is the external reality in the poem.
It can be expressed in other ways and other languages. But the
latent content of poetry is in that particular form of wording,
and in no 'other.
How
is the latent content contained in the
original word
and not contained in the sense of the words
i.e. in the portions
of external reality which the words symbolise? The emotions
are
not
associated
aflFectively with
the portion
of external
reality symbolised by the 'manifest content,
for another lan-
guage can be made to symbolise the same portion of external
reality, and still it is not the poem. How then did the original
words contain the emotional content ‘Nn themselves"" and not
in the things they symbolised? Dream
analysis
gives us
the
answer, by
elective association of ideas. In any association of
ideas two images are tied to each other by something different,
like sticks by a cord. In poetry they are tied by affects.

X
poetry's dream-work
213
If a word
is abstracted from
its surroundings and concen-
trated on in the same way as an analyst asked his patient to
concentrate on any particular image of a dream, a number of
associations will rise vaguely to
thie mind. In a simple word
like
‘ 'spring"
there
are hundreds of them;
of greenness,
of
youth, of fountains, of jumping; every word drags behind it a
vast bag and baggage of emotional associations, picked up in
the thousands of different circumstances in which the word was
used. It is these associations that provided the latent content of
affect which
is
the
poem.
Not
the
ideas
of "greenness",
"youth", but the affective cord linking the ideas of "greenness"
and
"youth"
to
the
word
"spring",
constitutes
the
raw
material of poetry.
Of course
the
thing "spring"
(the season) denoted by the
word "spring" also has many affective associations. These are
used by the novel. Poetry is concerned with the more general,
subtle and instinctive affects which are inimediately associated
with
the word
"spring" and
therefore
include such almost
punning associations as those connected with spring (a foun-
tain) and spring (to jump). Hence the tendency of poetry to
play with words,
to pun openly or secretly,
to delight in the
texture
of words.
This
is
part of the technique of poetry
which treats words anti-grammatically to
realise their imme-
diate and even contradictory affective
tones. Tjie novel uses
words grammatically so as sharply to exclude all meanings and
therefore all affective tones, except one clear piece of reality,
and then
derives
the emotional content from
this
piece of
reality and its active relation with the other pieces of reality in
the story as part of a perceptual life-experience.
When we read a line of poetry these other ideas to which
the affects are associated do not rise to the mind. We get the
leaping and gushiness of "spring"
in poetry's use of it as a
word
fo3f the idea "season", but we do not get the fountain
or the jump except in an open poetic pun. They remain uncon-
scious. Poetry
is a kind of inverted dream. Whereas in dream the
real aflFects are partly suppressed and the blended images rise
into the conscious, in poetry the associated images are partly
suppressed and it is the blended affects that are present in the
consciousness, in the form of affective organisation.

Why
is
there a manifest content
at
all? Why
are not
all
.
images suppressed? Why is not great poetry like the poetry of
the extreme symbolists, a mere collection of words, meaning
nothing,
but words
themselves
full
of affective
association?
Why should poetry state, explain, narrate, obey grammar, have
syntax, be capable of paraphrase, since if paraphrased it loses
its affective value?
The answer
is, because poetry
is an adaptation
to
external
reality.
It
is an emotional attitude towards the world*
It
is
made of language and language was created to signify otherness,
to indicate portions of objective reality shared soci^ly* It lives
in the same language as scientific thought. The manifest con-
tent represents a statement of external reality. The manifest
content is symbolic of a certain piece of external reality—^be it
scene, problem, thought, event. And the emotional content
is
attached to
this statement of reality,
not in actual experience
but
in the poem. The emotional content sweats
out of the
piece of external reality. In life this piece of external reality is
devoid of emotional
tone,
but described
in those particular
words, and no others, it suddenly and magically shimmers with
affective
colouring.
That
affective
colouring
represents
an
emotional organisation similar to that which the poet himself
felt when faced (in phantasy or actuality) with that piece of
external reality. When the poet says.
Sleep, that knots up the ravelled sleave of care,
he is making a manifest statement. The paraphrase
Slumber, that unties worry, which is like a piece of tangled knitting,
carries over most of the manifest content, but the
affective
tones which lurked in the associations of the words used have
vanished. It is like a conjuring trick. The poet holds up a piece
of the world and we see it glowing with a strange emotional
fire. If we analyse it
^ Nationally'', we find no fibre. Yet none the
less,
for
ever afterwards,
that piece of reality
still keeps an
afterglow, about
it,
is
still
fragrant with emotional
life. So
poetry enriches external reality for us.
The* affective associations used by poetry are of many forms.

X
poetry's dream-work
215
Sometimes they are sound associations, and then we
call the
line '"musical"—^not that the language is specially harmonious;
to
a foreigner
it would- probably have no
particular
verbal
melody:
Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the books
In Vallambrosa
is not musical to someone who l^nows no English. But to an
English
ear
the
emotive
associations wakened
are
aroused
through sound rather than sense linkages, and hence we
call
the line musical.
So,
too, with Verlaine's
line, musical only
to ears attuned to the emotive associations of French nasals:
Et O—ces voix d*enfants chantant dans la coupole,
or the old fairy-tale title, "La Belle aux bois dormant".
It
is
impossible
to
have
affects
in
poetry without
their
adherence to symbols of external
reality,
for poetry's
affects
(in so far as they are poetic) are social, and it is impossible for
different
subjects
to be linked
except by
a common
object
(by
"matter"). The
logical conclusion of symbolism
is not
poetry but music. And here
it may be objected—^music con-
sists of sounds which refer to no external reality and yet music
is an art and has a social content. Exactly—^because in music the
symbols have
ceased to "refer"
to
external reality and have
become portions of external reality themselves ahd, in doing so,
have necessarily generated ai formal structure (the scale, "rules"
of harmony,
etc.) which
gives them the
rigidity and
social
status of external reality. The notes of music themselves are the
manifest
content
of
music,
and
they
therefore
obey
not
grammatical (subjective) but pseudo-mathematical (objective)
laws: of course they are necessarily distorted or organised within
the
compass
of those
rules.
In- the same way
architecture
becomes
external reality and
is distorted or organised within
the compass of the rules of use-function.
The technique of the poet consists in this,
that not all the
affects associated with any particular words
rise up into the
consciousness, but only those that are required. This is done by

2i6
illusion and reality
X
the arrangement of the words in such a way that their clusters
of associations, impinging on each other heighten some affec-
tive
associations
and
inhibit
the
others,
and
so
form
an
organised mass
of emotion. The
affective
colouring
of one
word takes reflected shadow and light from the colours of the
other
words*
It
does
this
partly through
their
contiguity,
particularly
in
synthetic
languages
(Latin and
Greek),
and
partly through
their grammatical
connection,
particularly
in
analytic languages (English, Chinese); but chiefly through the
''meaning^'
as
a
whole. The
manifest
content,
the
literal
meaning,
the
paraphrasable
sense,
is
a kind
of
bridge,
or
electrical conductor, which puts
all the
affective currents of
each word into contact. It
is like a switchboard; some of the
affective associations fade away directly they enter
it, others
run down into other words and alter their colour; others blend
together and heighten a particular word* The whole forms the
specific fused glow which is that poem's affective organisation
or emotional attitude to its meaning. Hence the same word has
a different affective coloration in one poem from what it has in
another, and it is for this reason that a poem is concrete. It is
affectively concrete; each word has a special affective signifi-
cance in that poem' different from what it has in another. In
this way the emotional content does not float about fluidly in
the mind;
it
is
firmly attached, by
a hundred
interweaving
strands, to the manifest content—a piece of external reality. A
poem's content is not just emotion,
it is organised emotion, an
organised
emotional
attitude
to
a piece
of external
reality.
Hence
its
value—^and
difficulty-p-as
compared
with
other
emotions, however
strong,
but unorganised—a sudden
inex-
plicable
fit of sorrow, a gust of blind rage,
a blank despair.
Such emotions are unaesthetic because unorganised. They are
unorganised socially because they are not organised in relation
to a socially accepted external reality. They are unconscious of
outer necessity* The emotions of poetry are part of the manifest
content. They seem to be in the. external reality as
it appears
in
the poem. We do not appear
to
take up
an emotional
attitude to a piece of reality;
it is there, given in the reality:
that
is the way of emotional cognition. In poetic cognition,
objects are presented already stamped with feeling-judgments.

X
poetry's dream-work
Z17
Hence the adaptive value of poetry* It is like a real emotional
experience*
It is plain that poetry may be judged in different ways; either
by the importance of the manifest content, or by the vividness
of the affective colouring* To a poet who brings a new portion
of external
reality
into
the ambit of poetry, we
feel more
gratitude
than
to
one who
brings
the
old
stale
manifest
contents* But the first poet may be poor in the affective colour-
ing with which he soaks his piece of reality* It may be the old
stale colouring, whereas our other poet, in spite of his conven-
tional piece of reality, may achieve a new affective tone* Old
poets we
shall judge almost
entirely by
their
affective tone;
their manifest
contents have long belonged to our world of
thought* Hence the apparent triteness of old poetry which yet
is a ^reat triteness* From new poets we demand new manifest
contents and new affective colouring, for it is their function to
give us new emotional attitudes to a new social environment,
A poet who provides both to
a high degree will be a good
poet* A poet who brings into his net a vast amount of new
reality to which he attaches a wide-ranging ajffective colouring
we shall
call a ^reat poet, giving Shakespeare
as an instance.
Hence great poems are always long poems, just because of the
quantity of reality they must include as manifest content* But
the manifest content, whatever it
is,
is not the purpose of the
poem* The
purpose
is
the
specific
emotional
organisation
directed towards
the manifest content and provided by the
released affects* The affects are not ^latent", as in dream; it is
the associated ideas which are suppressed to form the latent
content* Just
as
the key
to dream
is a
series of instinctive
attitudes which provide the mechanism of dream-work, so the
key
to poetry
is
a 'cluster of suppressed
pieces
of external
reality—a vague unconscious world of life-experience*
Poetry
colours
the world
of
reality with
affective
tones*
These affective colours are not ^^pretty-pretty",
for it is
still
the real world of necessity, and great poetry will not disguise
the nakedness of outer necessity, only cause it to shine with the
glow
of
interest*
Poetry
soaks
external
reality—^nature and
society—^with emotional significance* This significance, because
it gives the organism an appetitive interest in external reality,

ILLUSION AND REALITY
X
2i8
enables the organism to deal with it more resolutely, whether
in the world of reality or of phantasy* The primitive who would
lose interest in the exhausting labour necessary to plough an
arid abstract collection of soil, will find heart when the earth
is charged with the affective colouring of /^Mother Nature'',
for now, by the magic of poetry,
it glows with the appetitive
tints of sexuality or filial love* These affective colours are not
unreal because they are not scientific, for they are the colour-
ing of the genotype's own instincts, and these instincts are as
real as the earth is real* The significant expression projected by
poetry on
to
the
face
of external
reality
is simply
this,
a
prophecy of the
endless attempt of the genotype to mould
necessity to its own likeness, in which it obtains a continually
increasing success*
‘^Matter, surrounded by a sensuous poetic
glamour,
seems
to
attract man's
whole
entity by
winning
smiles*" So
said Marx and Engels of materialism before
it
became one-sided mechanical “materialism, when
it was
still
bathed in the artistic splendour of the Renaissance* That sensuous
glamour
is given by poetry; and materialism became one-sided
when, afraid of feeling the self, it became aridly scientific, and
matter vanishes in a logical but empty wave-system*
Poetry
restores life and value to matter, and puts back the genotype
into the world from which it was banished*

Although we equated dream to poetry, we saw that^thete
were
essential
differences*
Poetry
is
creative; dream
is
not*
Poetry
is
creative because
it
is
directed feeling* In dream the
associations
are
"free"—^reality's
images
are
'manipulated
according to the genotype's desires,
just as iron filings over a
magnet "freely" arrange themselves along the lines of force*
In poetry, however, feeling is fashioned into a social form by
being made to live in the common world of perceptual reality*
Poetry
externalises
emotion* The
self
is
eoafressed—forcibly
squeezed out* Emotion is minted—^made current coin* Feelings
are given soci4 value* Work is done* Dream-work is precisely
not labour, poetic dreamwork
is; because one produces
social
commodities, the other does not*

X
poetry's dream-work
'
219
It is for this reason that peotry-'s technique diflFers from that
of dream* Below the surface of the dream lie the unconscious
instinctive wishes*
Instinct
is
blind,
it cannot alter
itself as
long as it is unconscious and incapable of self-conditioning, for
it has no will but only automatic responses to stimuli* These
instinctive wish-patterns
dictate the dance of images in the
brain, which are associated with the wish-patterns by indirect
affective ties* But the ties themselves are suppressed in dream,
for
everything
that
wakes
the
affects
to
action must
be
avoided if the dreamer is to sleep on* The vast field of affect-
laden images is ""out of bounds"* ""Let sleeping affects lie"
is
the motto
of dream-wishes* They
are
suppressed by being
phantastically
gratified
as
easily
as one makes a thoughtless
habitual movement*
In poetic illusion the process is inverted* Dreams ascendffrom
the
unconscious
upwards
and
are' therefore
blind and
un-
creative* Poems
descend from the
consciousness downwards
and are therefore aware and creative* Dream fearfully avoids
the dynamic region of the emotions,
so
as not to wake the
sleeper
to
action;
poetry
explores
it
courageously,
so
as
to
change the inner world*
The
memory-images
of dream
blindly
follow
the
wire-
pulling of the instincts* But the words of poetry follow a pur-
poseful path* Their mission
is,
first to stir up the affects and
then to reorganise them* The only result of dream
is a tem-
porary and arbitrary pattern of images drawn from reality and
rearranged at the behest of the instincts* ""The world
is not
thus, but thus,"
say the
instincts, and remould
it in
their
dream, but sometimes the instincts are so modified that they
quarrel with themselves, and the contradictions of the dream
explode in affects that Wake us*
Poetry, however, takes its words and arranges them in such
a way that the affects are roused and forced to take up a new
organisation towards reality, a new emotional attitude* Dream
moulds reality to the instincts, and
is therefore of little use
except to guard the dreamer from external reality and so keep
him sleeping*
Poetry moulds the
instincts
to

Poetry
flo'W'S from
reality down
to the
instincts,
stopping
only
on
the
last
outpost
of perception where
it
encounters the instincts face to
face* Dream flows from the
instincts to the boundary of reality, at the limit of attention,
and stops there, short of actual achievement, because
it stops
short of action*
We need not be surprised,
therefore,
that poetry
is public
and dream private,
for consciousness
is a social construction*
The conscious psychic contents which the ego holds together
are socially given contents* True, they cohere because the body
which contains them is materially one object, but the materials
that cohere—^morals, knowledge, culture, aspirations, duties
are
all
socially
given*
Unsocial man
is
brute,
unconscious,
instinctive, and therefore without will* An instinctive uncon-
scious
organism
has no
will,
but only an automatic reflex,
responsive to internal or external stimuli* It has no freedom,
for freedom requires a will* The essence of willing is that con-
sciousness
is
aware
of
those
reasons
that make
its
choice
inevitable, and it
is just that inevitability which
is will* The
fulfilled will
is the conscious dialectic of the psyche in which
the strife between the instincts of the body and the necessity
of outer nature
is resolved by a conscious action which con-
tains both feeling and perception* This conscious microcosm is
creative because it can act voluntarily, for ultimately conscious
action and
creation
are
the same*
Creation,
as
opposed
to
accidental appearance,
is the will moulding instead of blind
necessity evolving* Accident carves the rocks into strange un-
premeditated shapes, but the will hews the stone into a desired
sculpture* Bothf are aspects of necessity*
The poet,
then, must be
a man sensitive above
all to the
associations and affective tones of words—^not the personal but
the collective tones* How
is he to differentiate between per-
sonal and collective tones? He cannot consciously, and no poet
can avoid the danger of writing verse which is meaningful to
himself but meaningless to other people* All he can do
is to
live his affective life socially; to live with words* For indeed
he can only live with words socially* He will meet them in
books, in literature, in scientific papers, in journals, in speech.

but always they will be met in public. Thus if he lives with
words instead of memory-images, he will master the technique
of poetry, for poetry is written with words.
The poet’s mastery of word associations gives him his tools
for his creative task. His task is this. An emotional reorganisa-
tion must be made public, must be expressed by words in a
collectively accessible form. Let us give our phrase—emotional
reorganisation—a more
current
psychological
form.
Psycho-
therapy has
evolved the conception of the autonomous com-
plex. A complex
is a constellation of contents in the psyche
which gather to themselves psychic energy. They become organ-
ised and full of dynamic power; they occupy a large part of the
psyche. The psyche has many small complexes, but they only
become complexes
in
the
therapeutic
sense when
they
are
repelled
by
the
chiefly
conscious
contents
of
the
psyche
(repression) and
are unknown to the
""ego”,
that
is,
to
the
consciously thinking and feeling portion of the psyche. They
become dangerous when they develop a ^Vill of their own”,
influence the actions of the psyche unknown to the conscious-
ness, and give
rise to neurotic
conflicts, doubts and strange
anxieties. The man seems torn in half. He has two motives and
two
wills.
Similar symptoms are seen in Pavlov’s dogs when
they have been conditioned to make two different responses to,
say, a square and a circle. If an object midway between these
shapes
is presented to them, they exhibit a canine caricature of
the neurotic’s hesitation. An emotional reorganisation
is the
resolution in some degree of an autonomous complex by making
it socially conscious.

Psycho-therapy draws its conceptions from pathology.
It
is
impossible
fully
to, understand
the
relation of
illusion
to
reality* in man’s mind and
life without understanding
the
relation of insanity to the healthy functioning of thought.
In
dream,
as we
already
saw,
the
stimulus
to
action
is
phantastically gratified in a stream of affectively-toned images
in which both affect and image are distorted in their relation to
reality.
This
distortion
is
permissible
precisely because the

222
ILLUSION AND REALITY
X
dream by definition cannot issue in action, since its purpose is
to
protect
the
living
body
from
active
relation
with
its
environment*
• Man makes a step forward when he injects the dream into
waking
life. But this very injection narrows the scope of the
biologically
permissible
in phantasy.
Because phantasy now
issues
in
action
it must be geared in some way
to present
reality, for present reality determines action.
But it cannot be geared to present reality on both sides, sub-
jective and objective, for to do so simply equates phantasy with
perception, with man's immediate vision of external reality and
his attitude towards that reality.
It
is
therefore
distorted
in
space
to produce
the mystic
illusion, centring round the spell and the rite, ‘which seems to
drag
all reality into the
circle of the tribe by the power of
magic and the word.
It
is
distorted in time to produce the
myth, or story. These two forms of phantasy, myth and magic,
or theology and mysticism, correspond to the evolutionary and
classificatory aspects of man's
plastic relation to
reality, but
they
are
still
impure—^subjective
is mixed with
objective,
science with art. They are still religion. To make the subjective
more pure and internal, and the objective more precise and
external,
they must be separated out by the dissolution and
manipulation of the ^^other" side.
Hence waking phantasy is distorted on one side. Art distorts
phantasy on the side of external reality by the device of the
mock world; science distorts it on the side of subjective reality
by the device of the mock ego. Yet this distortion is not dis-
tortion for the sake of distortion on the distorted side;
it
is
distortion for the sake of greater accuracy on the
^ ‘other" side.
Now that other side can only reach out to a greater precision
beyond that of present reality by association with
the con-
sciousnesses of other men—^by passing from, the semi-conscious-
ness qf brute phantasy to the consciousness of a man.
*
Therefore the undistorted side of art—the subjective side
is developed by interaction with a social subjectiveness or social
ego, and the undistorted side of science, the objective side,
is
developed by interaction with a social objectiveness or social
woHd.

X
poetry’s dream-work
223
Science and art are merely abstract and generalised forms of
the
scientific and
artistic elements in individual phantasies*
Individual
phantasies
are,* however,
subject
to
disturbance*
Men
go
insane*
Study
of these disturbances should throw
light on the nature of phantasy*
Madmen are men whose theory has got out of gear with
reality as evidenced by their practice—their action* This reality
can only be a social reality because this is the only reality known
to
society* Madmen
are men whose theory of reality differs
markedly from that of society* They are socially maladapted*
In them
there
is a
conflict—a
conflict between
their
social
experience—their
life in society—and their phantastic theory
of life*
Psychiatry now tends
to
recognise two main
divisions of
insanity: (J) the manic-depressive or cyclothymic disturbances,
and
(J) the schizophrenic,
catatonic or dementia praecox dis-
turbances* The two groups are by Kretschmer closely associated
with two
types of body constitution,
the pyknic (stout and
fleshy) and the asthenic (thin and spare)* Apart from insanity
or the psychoses, there are disturbances of mental functioning
—the psycho-neuroses* There
is a general tendency to find a
close
association between
hysteric
neuroses and cyclothymic
insanity, and between psychasthenic neuroses and schizophrenic
insanity*
Jung's division of psychological types into extraverted and
introverted
is
also based on
, the assumption that extraverted
types, when mentally disturbed, tend to hysteric and manic-
depressive
states, while introverted types
are more likely
to
suffer from the psychasthenic neuroses and schizophrenia* The
former group
is generally regarded as easier to cure than the
latter*
Now we saw that dream is the vehicle of^a tension which is
resolved wholly in the phantastic plane by a double distortion
of subject (affective tones) and object (memory images)* Mad-
men solve their conflicts by detaching their theory from social
reality and making
it personal* They are awake and cannot
. solve
their problems by
this double dream-like
shift* Their
phantasy will be geared at one end to social reality*
It
is
bur
contention
that
the
extraverted,
cycloth/mic

ILLUSION AND REALITY
X
224
hysteric
type
is geared
to
reality
externally* This
is
in
fact
clinically
correct*
Even
the
manic-depressive
can
^^orient*^
himself correctly, find his way about, and generally notice what
is going on*
MacCurdy points out that he reacts to real stimuli, but in an
exaggerated way* For example, he hears whispering below and
imagines it to be a conversation regarding his assassination* He
then
betrays
all
the
fear
appropriate
to
an
attempt
at
assassination*
In adjusting himself to reality he has desocialised his ego. As a
result it becomes unconscious and correspondingly violent and
barbaric*
It
oscillates
uncontrollably and explodes
with
the
slightest provocation on
the all-or-none
basis* To
observers,
therefore, the manic-depressive seems a man of wild passions
who has forgotten external reality* But to himself he does not
seem
like
that,
for
his
ego
has
become
unconscious
and
primitive and has therefore retired from his conscious field* Of
course this throws out of gear the external reality in his con-
scious field, so that it is always being distorted by unconscious
forces* If he hears the word
^ lobster' \ he promptly assumes he
is to be boiled alive* Because his ego has become unconscious
and desocialised, he is its slave.
The schizophrenic, however,
exhibits an emotional consist-
ency and
integration
like
the
manic-depressive's
orientation
towards external reality* The classical clinical sign of schizo-
phrenia, according to MacCurdy,. is when the patient does not
show an affective reaction proportioned to the stimulus* For
example, he declares that he hears people whispering that they
will
assassinate him,
but he shows
no
fear*
Eventually he
shows a complete lack of orientation,
is unable even to feed
himself, and finally passes into a private world of reality* As an
introvert, attaching most value to the subject, he has resolved
his conflict by desocialising external reality, so that he lives in
a dream world—a personal world* This dream world reflects his
conscious ego, which, however, because the dream world is an
unchecked
reflection of
its movement,
does
not seem
very
evident to the observer* The observer, being a part of negated
outer reality, is out of touch with the schizophrenic's ego* The
schizophrenic's
conscious
ego
is
not
roused
to
passion
or

X
poetry's dream-work
225
emotion because the dream world does not annoy it but ‘*con-
forms" to
it* Hence the conscience and strong social content
of the schizophrenic's mental world, which does not of course
affect his conduct, for (as in paranoia) the outer world is always
"*in the wrong"*
It
justifies
his desires by altering
itself to
conform' with them* This 'is why Freud
calls
the paranoiac
narcissistic; and
this
explains
his
incurability and untouch-
ability*
Now we regard the phantastic device of art as similar in its
general mechanism
to
the
introverted
distortion of schizo-
phrenia and psychasthenic neurosis, and the phantastic device
of science as similar in its general mechanism to the extraverted
distortion of cyclothymia and hysteria*
Does this mean that we regard science and art as in any sense
pathological and illusory? No, for although there
is a similar
psychological mechanism at work, art is no more neurosis than
thought is dream* And the difference consists precisely in this,
that science and art have a social content* The reality around
which
the
extraverted
hysteric
or
cyclothymic
distorts
his
theory is private reality, a reality that contradicts the whole of
the social theory of reffity in his consciousness* This contradic-
tion,
instead of leading
(as in science) to
a synthesis of his
private experience with the social theory of reality (demanding
a change of both),
leads
to conduct which denies the
social
theory of reality* The desocialisation of the cyclothymic's ego
leads to an uprush of the instincts from the unconscious which
distorts his relation to external reality and therefore his whole
action* The desocialisation of the schizophrenic's conception of
external
reality
leads
to
a
slavery of perception
to
the
ego
which removes the 'Trake" from it so that its world becomes
dream-like and unreal*
Thus the psychological mechanism of science,
because
its
reality is public and true, produces in the sphere of theory an
ego which
is
the
very opposite of that of the cyclothymic
extravert—an ego which is drained of affect and quality, which
is
neutral,
passive and
serenely
conscious
of
necessity* Of
course
this very
reality, because
it
is without the dynamism
and appetite of the instincts, requires the emotional reality of
art for its completion* It is true, therefore, that a world which
p

2z6
ILLUSION AND REALITY
X
tried to live by science alone would deny its theory in practice
and show the nervestorms of a cyclothymic, not because science
is
cyclothymic, but because
it
is only one part of concrete
living*
The
reality
around which
the
psychasthenic
neurotic
or
schizophrenic distorts the outside world
is a private ego,
his
own private desires and appetites. Around this he ^'arranges'* a
whole mock
world
(the
compulsive
actions,
obsessions
or
phobias of the neurotic, or the complete screen of fancy of the
schizophrenic).
But
the
psychological
mechanism
of
art,
because its ego
is public and noble, produces in the sphere of
theory
a world which
is
beautiful and
strong.
This
world,
because it is drained of necessity, requires the mechanism of
science for realisation. A world which lived by art alone would
deny
its theory in practice and
live in a beautiful world of
dream, while
all
its actions would produce only misery and
ugliness.

Let us examine the difference between the two forms of
extraverted mental
disturbance. The hysteric
does not deny
the world of external reality (taking external in the sen^e of
^'external to the body^^). He accepts this. The reality he dis-
torts and desocialises is that of his body regarded subjectively.
It
is
as if he does not dare to challenge social reality in that
portion of it where society is paost firmly entrenched, and he
therefore selects his body as something in which he has a special
proprietorial
interest,
and
distorts
that. Hence
the famous
hysteric-illnesses
(hysteric
dumbness,
paralysis,
blindness,
hyper-aesthesia and anaesthesia) which are socially unreal in the
sense that they are only functional and non-organic, and yet are
real to the hysteric because he
is, by definition, unconscious of
their real cause.
Classic examples of the solution of a conflict between the
instincts and
the
environment by
hysteric
means
are
the
hysteric
soldier, whose
fear of death
takes
the form of an
hysteric paralysis, and the hysteric woman, whose unsatisfied
love
or
fear
of domination
takes
the form
of an
hysteric

X
poetry's dream-work
227
illness*
Hence
the
term
'"organ-language*'
for
hysteric
symptoms.
But if the conflict
is unresolvable by this means, then the
extravert's
ego,
forced
into
unconsciousness,
challenges
the
whole domain
of
social
reality,
including
that
outside
his
body. He becomes mad in relation to his environment. Forces
coming from he knows not where, irrupt into his environment
and completely distort it. His ego, forced into the darkness of
his soul, grimaces back at him from the environment, though
he does not recognise it there.
The psychasthenic
neurotic,
however,
is a man who
chal-
lenges at first the social reality. Therefore, just as the conflict of
the extravert
is a conflict with an external reality (Le. a per-
ceived external reality) which
is too hard for his unconscious
ego, the conflict of the introvert is a conflict with a felt ego
(conscious or morality) which
is too hard for his unconscious
environment. Hence the psychasthenic symptoms of lack of
interest in external reality, in life—^an inability to face up to
its problems or to do anything about them. He invents such
external realities as inimical men (paranoia) or objects (phobias)
or processes (compulsions) in order to justify his desires. The
psychasthenic neurotic does not deny the existence of the ego
as a social individual, as an ego in touch with other egos, but
claims to be excepted from the usual rules owing to its difficult
environmental circumstances. Hence the endless martyrisation
and introspection of the psychasthenic neurotic which makes
such
remunerative and
almost
incurable
customers
of
the
psycho-analyst. Because of his "special difficulties", this type
of neurotic is always trying to create a specially "easy" world.
He solves his conflict by "blaming" the emotion caused by it
on
to
other
details
of environmental
reality. The emotion
generated by some sexual
crisis,
for example,
is attached to
some
trifling
object. The emotion generated by
a
soldier's
being buried in a trench,
or his fear of this,
is
in neurosis
displaced to all dark objects or shut-in places.
Thus just as the hysteric does not deny external reality but
adjusts
it in the domain of his body considered as an object
suffering from physical disease, so the psychasthenic neurotic
does not deny his responsibilities as a social ego but adjusts

ILLUSION AND REALITY
X
zz8
them
in
his
environment,
which
he^
distorts
by
elaborate
rationalisations and inventions* The slightest detail is seized on
and
twisted.
The
hysteric
speaks
an
organ-language;
the
neurotic
a
feeling-language*
One
asks
society
to
believe
nothing he
does not
see (and manufactures
the
proof);
the
other nothing he does not feel (and manufactures the cause)*
Thus just as the hysteric is unconscious of the real cause of his
paralysis,
the
neurotic
is
unconscious
of the
cause
of
his
'Mifl&cult**
circumstances* He avoids
fear by avoiding closed
places; he does not realise that what he is really avoiding by his
claustrophobia is going to the trenches.
But if the conflict is insoluble by this means then the neurotic
denies social reality completely and becomes unconscious of his
self*
This
is
schizophrenia* He
still
remains
conscious
of
external
reality* An example
is the Korsakoff syndrome* The
patient knows everything external that happens to him, but
does not know
it
is happening
as
to him* He
lacks what
ClaparMe
called
^*moiet^'\ To
take
an
example
given by
MacCurdy: a patient was pricked by her physician with a pin
concealed in his hand* Next time he went to touch her she
shrank away* Asked why, she replied hazily: ^^Hands sometimes
have pins in them^\ She could not be persuaded that she, as an
ego, had been pricked, but merely that a pricking had happened
in her field of perceptual consciousness* When occupied with
phantasy
this
type
is
simply
a
receptacle
for
phantastic
panoramas, whereas the cyclothymic is a phantastic Napoleon,
a hero, an enormous
Now we have already compared the mechanism of extra-
version with that of science* We will go further and compare
the mechanism of hysteria with the classificatory sciences and
of cyclothymia with the evolutionary sciences.
The hysteric distorts, his body to provide a reality consonant
with
a wished
reality* In the same way the mathematician
^^imagines*^ an ego ordering, classifying, operating everywhere in
external reality* But precisely because with the mathematician
this external reality is social, real and therefore conscious, the
ego which thus
operates
is unconscious,
abstract, drained of
any distorting or qualifying subjectivity*
The cyclothymic loses grip even on his ego to achieve an

X
poetry's dream-work
229
adjustment in accordance with his
'"difficulties". As a result
his delusion looks out at him everywhere in his perceptual field.
In the same way the biologist or sociologist imagines an ego
passively
observing,
noting, feeling everywhere
in the sphere
of
reality
chosen.
But
because
with
the
scientist
this
external reality is social, real and conscious, the ego which thus
observes
is
bare
of subjective
or
personal
bias—is
the
all-
observing neutral eye of concrete society which yet spreads the
quality it is interested in everywhere.
In the same way, since we have compared the mechanism of
introversion with that of art, we will go further, and compare
that of psychasthenic neurosis with poetry and that of schizo-
phrenia with the novel. The neurotic substitutes for the social
environment a special personal environment which "accounts
for"
his subjective difficulties. He makes an unreal environ-
ment
consistent with
his
desires. The
poet,
however,
sub-
stitutes for the affects and "I" of his experience a still more
real and social "I"; he forces his "I" completely to enter the
social ego, and produces, but for the opposite reason, a mock
"adjusted" external world. Hence all poetry, as we have seen,
turns on the social "T".
The
catatonic,
however,
does
not even make
his world
a
real world of exceptionally
difficult circumstances. The
real
world
vanishes, from
society
altogether; and
the
catatonic's
world
becomes
coincident
with
a
world
of
"I-organised"
environmental contents, an ego-created bundle of remembered
percepts. The novelist, however, makes his "T" coincide not
merely with a generalised human "I" (which
is the way the
poet lifts his "I" from an "I" in specially difficult circumstances
to an "I" in all human circumstances) but with the concrete
"I"s developed by the individuation of society. Hence
the
novel is not seen with all its contents oriented round one "I",
as in poetry, but it becomes an objective world, a world appar-
ently like a selection of society surveyed from without, just as
the catatonic's "I" is extended to become a world of apparently
objective percepts.
Why
is the hysteric and the cyclothymic (according to the
experience of anthropologists) far more common in primitive
societies?
Because,
in
their
primitive
undifferentiated
state.

ILLUSION AND REALITY
X
230
the environment or objective reality
is far more likely to be
the cause
^ of acute mental tension and require the
^^healing^^
phantasy than
is the ego or subjective reality.
Pririiitives are
held firmly to the demands of the simple social environment.
Conscience
is
clear
and
imperative.
The
development
of
ideology, and the cleavage of conscience due to the rise of class
antagonisms, produces the torn egos and suppressed selves of
modern
society.
Psychasthenic
neurosis
is
a
characteristic
bourgeois disease. In the war, hysteria was, according to Rivers,
commonest in the ranks;
psychasthenic
neurosis more usual
among the
officers. It
is the disease of a class thrown by the
cleavage of society away from external reality on to the con-
sciousness, just as hysteria is the disease of a class thrown away
from
consciousness
on
to
external
reality.
It
required
the
development of a class society to develop consciousness by its
separation, but it requires the reappearance of a classless society
to synthesise what has now grown pathologically far apart
thinking and being, theory and practice. Schizophrenia is the
disease of philosophy and idealism.
Thus, although
there
is
a correspondence between
artistic
and
schizophrenic
solutions,
and
between
scientific
and
cyclothymic mechanisms,
because there
is a resolution of a
social conflict by similar roads, the goal is in fact the opposite.
As compared with existing normality, the mad road leads
to
greater illusion, unconsciousness and privacy, the scientific or
artistic road
to
greater
reality,
consciousness and
publicity.
Hence in catatonia the affects are repressed and in art they are
abundantly conscious;
in cyclothymia the ego
is -^Vild^^*
in
science it is conscious of necessity.
For what it amounted to was this. Faced with a conflict in
experience between social consciousness and real life experience,
the mentally-deranged chose to solve it by eliminating what was
conflicting in consciousness, by making consciousness less true
and social, and more private and illusory; whereas the scientist
or artist chose to solve it by the opposite route, by dragging the
new in experience up into social consciousness, by making con-
sciousness more true and social, less private and illusory. They
meet a similar obstacle but go in opposite directions. Science
and art are '"divine madness' ' in this sense, that a contradiction

X
poetry's dream-work
231
in experience drives the madman to private
error and drives
scientist and
artist
to public truth* They are more sane than
the ''sane", who, because they experience no conflict or con-
tradiction in their lives,
are not faced with the possibility of
resolving it creatively* The only difference between artist and
scientist
is
that one
is
interested in the
subjective and the
other
in the
objective component of consciousness and
life*
The only difference between poet and mathematician on the
one hand, and the novelist and evolutionary scientist on the
other, is that one is interested in generalisation, in integration, in
a human
essence and an
abstract
reality, and
the
other
in
specialisation,
in
differentiation,
in human individuality and
a concrete reality*
Although the artist and the scientist in. the problems they
resolve go the opposite road to madness it does not follow that
they are wholly sane* For they can only resolve those problems
which are
socially real problems and have a general meaning
for society as a whole* The artist has subjective problems, the
scientist objective problems, which
are not susceptible of a
social solution, just as with other men* And of course the artist
faced with objective problems
is like the scientist faced with
subjective problems, both are at least as helpless as ordinary
men* This is only to say that science and art, because they are
social
reality
in
abstraction,
in
the most
generalised
and
essential form,
cannot
exactly
coincide with
concrete
living
which generates them,
but can only continually enrich and
develop it*
Psydio-analysis, and psychology generally, is unable to make
any clear distinction between the psychology of pathology and
genius, and between the process of mental creation and mental
delusion, because
it
is unable to show any causal distinction
between conscious and unconscious phantasy* The difference is
a social difference, but psychology, being bourgeois psychology,
cannot rise beyond the conception of an "individual in
civil
society";
it
cannot
separate
and
distinguish
the
biological
environment from the social environment, and consciousness is
a product of the social environment* We have already discussed
the
difficulties
to
which
this
gives
rise
in
the
Freudian
philosophy*

ILLUSION AND REALITY
X
23Z
The very cleavage of phantasy types
is due to the fact that
in dream, when the inactive body
is
released from concrete
living, distortion from reality can take place on two planes—
•
internal
and
external*
This
is
not
possible when dream
is
injected into waking life; hence the special types of madness*
At the same time, once madness has set in, the theoretical
possibility arises of a return to sleep of a deeper character, in
which adjustment takes place on a double plane once more,
but in a more penetrating way* In fact MacCurdy and Hoch's
work on benign stupors has revealed the clinical importance of
a special, prolonged, deep form of sleep (stupor) as a prognosis
of approaching cure in psychoses*
Evidently,
then,
sleep and
dream play an important part in the solution of private con-
flicts which arise during the day and are ^'solved** privately at
night* Hence,
too, no doubt the significance of the sleepless-
ness which
is so well recognised as a symptom of approaching
madness, and hence, too, the curative importance of bromides
and sleep-inducing drugs*

Our demarcation of ^^psychological
types^'
necessarily
calls
to mind Jung's
classic work on
the same
subject* How
far
does our division correspond with his?
Jung's earliest division was into extraverted and introverted
types* On
the whole
our
division
corresponds
with
his
extraversion involves valuation of externality, of perception, of
the olject^ whether in action or consciousness; and introversion
is valuation of internality, of feeling,
of the subject,
either in
consciousness or action*
Of course this does not mean that the introvert is essentially
sympathetic; on the contrary it is his feeling, not that of others,
which he values* It is the extravert who is sympathetic, but with
the weakness of a shallow feeling*
Jung found this vision insufficient, and therefore he distin-
guishedf four functions, irrespective of valuation of the object
or the subject* Of these functions two are rational—^feeling and
thinking,
and two
are
irrational—sensing and
intuiting* A
type has one main function and an auxiliary function which

X
poetry's dream-work
233
must be of a different character,
e.g. a rational function can
only be assisted by an
irrational function, and
vice versa. All
four functions exist in all psyches, and therefore individuation
—the development of one function at the expense of the other
—means that the functions not used sink into the unconscious*
Thus
in
a
thinker
feeling
sinks
into
the
unconscious
and
becomes correspondingly barbaric and crude* Here
it exerts a
compensatory
influence, and may
eventually
gain
in power
until, at first sporadically and then completely,
it becomes the
main function, and there is an enantiodromia^ a kind of conver-
sion pr complete
reversal of personality,
as when the
cold,
Christian-hating
Saul becomes
the
ardent
apostle
Paul,
or
when the dry mathematical person becomes a raving maniac*
Now
Jung's
rich
experience and
subtle mind
gives
this
classification great value and importance. It is confused, how-
ever,
owing
to
Jung's
epistemological
confusion
as
to
the
meaning of consciousness.
I regard Jung's
cleavage between
feeling and thinking as that between theory and practice. The
thinking
extravert
is
the
theoretical
extravert,
the man of
thought;
the
feeling
extravert
is the practical
extravert,
the
man of action* The feeling introvert, however, is the theoretical
introvert, and the thinking introvert is the practical introvert*
Of
course
both
the
theory
and
practice
of
introvert and
extravert is conditioned by their di&rent valuations of object
and subject—hence the apparent reversal of the functions in
theory and practice; and hence Jung's
initial mistake,
after-
wards corrected,
in believing introversion and extraversion to
be all-sufficient for the determination of psychological types*
Our
analysis
of
the
two-sidedness
of phantasy
(which
is
matched by a similar two-sidedness of practice) explains how
this reversal of functions occurs*
What
are we
to
make
of
^'sensing"
and
^ ^intuiting"
5
According
to
Jung,
* "sensing"
is
appreciation
of
external
phenomena
by
an
act
of
unconscious
apprehension,
and
""intuition"
is appreciation of internal phenomena by an act of
unconscious apprehension*
It seems to me that Jung has got himself into an epistemo-
logical confusion here* His types are real, but their mechanism
is wrongly grasped* Sensing
is not just irrational feeling, but

ILLUSION AND REALITY

the relation between them is the same as between poetry and
the
novel.
Sensing
is
conscious but poetic,
it
is
generalised
feeling; this-sidedness reduced to the common instinctive ego.
Feeling is conscious but concrete;
it
is individualised sensing,
sensing
given
the
status
of
particular
differentiated
egos.
Sensing is thus more primitive than feeling. In the same way
intuiting
is not irrational thinking, but the relation between
them
is the same
as between mathematics and biology.
In-
tuiting is conscious but mathematical; it is generalised thinking,
other-sidedness reduced to the abstract commonness of quan-
tity. Thinking
is
conscious but concrete;
it
is particularised
intuiting,
intuiting given the content of spheres of quality.
Intuiting is thus more primitive than feeling.
It has already been explained why poetry and mathematics
emerged in the history of our race before the story and the
evolutionary sciences. In the same way sensing and intuiting
are the earliest forms of thought—the reasoning of the leaders,
prophets, poets and lawgivers of primitive society.
Thus in general we agree with the importance of Jung's dis-
tinction between extraversion in which the object
is valued,
and introversion in which the subject is valued. We also agree
with
his warning that any one type may be
introverted in
relation
to
some
spheres
of
activity
and
extraverted
in
relation to others, and that this may change in the course of
his life. Hence a type has a fluidity and individuality even in
his
attitude
to
life. To
take Spearman's conception of two
factors
in
intelligence--^,
a
general
fund
applicable
to
all
fields, and
5, a special capacity, limited to one field—^not only
may g vary in
its ^^attitude"
as well as
its quantity, but the
various 5-factors too may^ vary in attitude and quantity.
Our analysis differs from Jung in three respects:
(i) He does not allow for the difference between a theoretical
and a practical approach
to
life, and the
existence of some
fields
in which a man
is
theoretical,
others
in which he
is
practical, and others where he shows a balanced unity. The more
a man is purely theoretical in some fields, the more he is likely
to be purely practical in others, and because of their divorce,
both tiieory and practice will show a special crude primitive-
ness which may make them seem of different quality from

X
poetry's dream-work
235
what they are when they appear as an active whole^ The thinking
and intuiting extraverts and the feeling and sensing introverts
are men
predominantly
theoretical
precisely
because
their
living behaviour
exhibits
a valuation of the object which
is
contrary to their phantastic valuation, and in the same way the
feeling and sensing extraverts and the thinking and intuiting
introverts have a predominantly practical approach to life*
(2) He regards sensing and intuiting as in some way uncon-
scious forms of feeling and
thinking,
although he uses
the
word irrational* But the
'"intuition" on which mathematical
reasoning
is based cannot be regarded as irrational* Of course
the word
"intuition"
begs the question, and
it
is not sug-
gested that the view of mathematics represented by Poincare's
school was right and Peano and Russell's logistic theory wrong*
Intuition is not used in a Platonic sense* It is simply applied
to the abstract generalising approach characteristic of logic and
a more primitive society, and so far from being irrational it is
rational in that
it
leads
(as
in Platonism-,
scholasticism and
Buddhist philosophy) to a glorification of the reason as against
practice*
(3) Jung has no adequate definition of consciousness and un-
consciousness except a reduction of "psychic energy" which
makes the unconscious contents sink below the threshold* For
this crude and unhelpful theory we have substituted the con-
ception of the desocidisation of conscious contents, either ego-
attached or environment-attached, due to the tension of con-
crete
living, which causes them
to become unconscious and
correspondingly archaic and infantile*
If real external re^ity conflicts with my consciousness in life,
I can actively and really change it* If I starve, I can get food;
if I am too cold,
I can put on clothes*
Scientific phantasy is
born from this kind of active change or practice, and though
it
is
introversion,
it
is
extraverted introversion—^introversion
with a view to changing outer reality* This change is its value,
purpose and mode of generation* The experience in life which
contradicts
existing
scientific
consciousness and demands
its
change
is always an experience in changing objective reality*
Science develops as an abstract system of knowing Nature by its
guidance of man's attempts to change Nature*

236
ILLUSION AND REALITY
X
But if my social ego conflicts with my consciousness in life,
I can actively and really change myself.
I can want
diflFerent
things—satisfy my
instincts
in
other ways open
to me
in
existing life—^by art-works for example. I then have an interest
in objects which is introverted—it is extraversion with a view
to changing my own ego. This change of the ego is the value,
purpose and mode of generation of art-works. The experience
in
life which
contradicts my
existing ego and demands
its
change
is always an experience encountered in satisfying my
wants, that
is, in changing myself. Art develops as a concrete
group of objects, a mock world, whereby man changes himself
and in doing so comes to know himself. The method of art is
the method of science turned inside out. One knows to do; the
other does
to
feel. One changes himself in order
to change
outer reality; the other changes' outer reality in order to change
himself. Both are necessary
to each other,
for the
limits of
outer and inner change are both set by necessity. Operating
with existing consciousness, men change reality to new forms.
Operating with existing forms, men change consciousness* The
first
is science in creative practice,
the second art in creative
practice.
Reverse
the
roles and we have
science
in
creative
theory, and art in creative theory.
Without
this understanding
of the
relation
of
theory
to
practice, Jung moves without realising it from one definition
of introversion to another*
Thinking and
intuiting
in
introversion,
ue.
in
theory,
are
practical
functions—functions
orienting
thought
round
the
outer
world.
In
practice,
in
extraversion,
they
are
world-
changing
actions,
actions changing perceptual
reality.
Feeling
and sensing in introversion, in theory, are theoretical functions
—functions orienting thought round the ego. In practice,
in
extraversion, they are self-changing,
ue, self-satisfying or self-
expressing
actions,
actions
satisfying
the
ego. This complex
relation is precisely what makes the complexity of types,
for
no man lives in the same way, no one has precisely the same
relation between phantasy and action. Hence Jung's thinking
and intuiting extraverts are men of
^ ^theory",
scientific men,
just as his thinking and intuiting introverts are men of action,
mysteriously practical men. His extraverted sensing and feeling

X
poetry's dream-work
Z37
men are practical men,
appetitive or sensual, and his feeling
and sensing introverts are theoretical men, mystics, prophets
or poets*
Jung s confusion regarding the ''compensatory"
r61e of the
unconscious springs from the same source* To say a function
becomes unconscious
is
to say that
it becomes
desocialised*
Jung's
functions
"sinking
into
the
unconscious"
through
repression or repulsion by the conscious contents are nothing
but man finding
parts of the
social ego
or
social
reality
in
himself at war with each other* His consciousness of himself
realised in his
life experience conflicts with his consciousness
of the outer world* We have already seen that he can adjust
himself in phantasy in two ways—by orienting the conscious-
ness of the outer world round his ego, or by orienting the ego
round the outer world*
If the outer world is major to him (the thinking intuiting
extravert) he will desocialise and adjust his ego round extern^
realities
so that
it becomes subjectively distorted; so that his
whole impression and valuation of it is false* In other words
the feeling side 6t the sensing side will become an unconscious
and archaic function; it will become desocialised and hence full
of instinct* As it emerges in objective action, the ego will to 14S
seem
inflated and
full
of
feeling*
But
precisely because
it
emerges in action in this wild instinctive way, the subjective
content of the ego will be slight* The maniac does not feel
profoundly; but he acts like a man in an overpowering passion,
because he lacks that consciousness of self which moderates,
complicates and subtilises man's response to reality* He makes
an "all or nothing" response* Jung's compensatory unconscious
is really the extravert's adjustment of life to reality in phantasy
,by
a
desocialisation of the
ego and an
unconsciousness
of
subjective
feeling, matched in
action by
a more passionate
behaviour,
Sijolie de grandeur or wild inflation of the ego*
The correct response of this type is scientific—changing the
environment and injecting a greater measure of environmental
reality into consciousness
as
a
result* The
first route
is the
route of illusion^ of madness, of an unsocial and unconscious
ego leading to a false conscious perception of the environment
and therefore a destructive behaviour; the second
is the route

238
ILLUSION AND REALITY
X
of sciencej of reality^ of a manipulation of the ego to produce a
truer conscious perception of the environment and therefore a
more
useful
behaviour* A
movement
of
extraversion
and
introversion is involved in both cases*
But
here
the maxim
^^Physician,
heal
thyself''
does
not
apply* The scientist's contribution to society as a result of his
special
tension
is
a
deeper
consciousness
of
environmental
reality, and what he requires from
it to heal
his own one-
sidedness
is
just what he cannot give but the
artist can
subjective consciousness and inner reality*
In
the same way with the feeling
or sensing
introvert,
a
conflict between consciousness and reality necessarily takes the
form of a distortion of conscious perception owing to the over-
valuing of the
ego* This leads to the psychasthenic neurotic
having
a
greater
consciousness
of emotion and
a
fictitious
independence of his environment, which, because of the denial
of the objective term, leads to a slavery to his environment in
the form of
^
^difficult circumstances"*
Nature,
not his ego,
becomes
primitive
and
uncontrollable
because
it
becomes
unconscious*
This type of introvert
is driven to
artistic production—to
change himself not by lowering
his
consciousness of outer
reality but by
injecting his
ego's
experience
into
the
social
consciousness* But this creative task in relation to society may
lead
to
a
one-sidedness
of personality which
can
only
be
corrected by the healing consciousness of outer reality drawn
from science*
The maladapted introvert attempts to free himself from his
conflict with **nature" by cutting himself off from the object;
but
his unconsciousness of the
object makes him
its blind
slave* The maladapted extrovert attempts to
cut himself off^
from the subject; but
his unconsciousness of himself makes
him the blind slave of his own instincts* Thus they prove in
their own persons that freedom
is the consciousness of neces-
sity* In theory they deny the ego or the world, only to prove
it in a wild barbaric way in practice—and this cleavage in them
between theory and practice is precisely wherein their madness
consists* Thus art points the road to the hysteric's cure; science^
to the neurotic's* Science and art in relation to the consciousness

X

239
are
therapeutic—science
for
the
introvert,
art
for
the
ex-
travert* In relation to practical life they are reality-changing,
science changing the world and art changing men.
Apart from
these weaknesses, Jung's study
is a profound
encyclopedia of the human psyche as a part of reality, a study
of how man realises or fails to realise his freedom in concrete
living. It represents the deepest study of the psyche possible to
a world-view which has not risen above the conception of an
individual living in civil society*
Science and art are the most abstract and generalised forms
of a way of phantastic adaptation via society which cannot be
separated from the reality of action, both of which are gener-
ated in the act of changing nature and so oneself, that
is, in
the act of living. Science and art are nothing if they do not
give to each of us an immediate guide to our personal lives in
all
their
aspects—^both a morality and an understanding, an
impulsion and an instrument which is not merely general but
guides each of us in every one of our concrete relations, which
is a compass to every act whereby we change nature and our-
selves. Our life is lived wrongly if this theory, which guides and
impels our every act, does not suck from every act new theory
and grow
as a developing thing. Human activity
is
activity
through objects. To separate science and art from ^^practical,
critical-revolutionary activity"
is to separate them from
life.
And this
is what modern civilisation increasingly tends to do.
Modern culture has known well enough how to tear itself
^
apart. It strove at fest in its rise to cut itself off from the sub-
ject, to throw itself completely into the object. Hence the wild
cyclothymic energy of the Elizabethan era of bourgeoisdom.
Now it has passed to the other pole, from hysteria to psychas-
thenia, and, attempting to cut itself off from the object which
it can no longer control, becomes the blind slave of necessity.
This
is the oscillation from mechanical material to
idealism
and thence to the helpless
eclecticism of positivism,
which,
by attempting to cut itself off from both subject and
object
and so dominate them both,
is the slave of both, a
helpless
victim of inere appearance.
Positivism leads to sumalisme in poetry. The dream-wori of
poetry
is abandoned, and men
float into
air, cut loose both

from subject and object—^unconscious of both, and
therefore
the
blind

of both*
^‘Free^^

Poetry
ceases
to
contain a dream-^work;
it
becomes
dream; the poet passes into a benign stupor* Benign^ for Aragon
has told us that the poet cannot rest on this position or return
to an earlier one, but can only recover by winning into a world
where
subject and object again become
social and
therefore
conscious, and the poet^s relation to
life again becomes
free,
revolutionary and laborious*

XI
THE ORGANISATION OF THE ARTS
I
Poetry
grasps
a
piece
of external
reality,
colours
it with
affective tone, and makes
it distil a new emotional attitude
which
is not permanent but ends when
die poem
is
over*
Poetry is in its essence a transitory and experimental illusion,
yet its effects on the psyche are enduring* It is able to live in
the same language with science—^whose essence is the expression
of objective reality—because in fact an image of external reality
is the distributed middle of both propositions, the other term
being external reality in the case of science, the genotype in the
case of poetry* This is not peculiar to poetry; it is general to all
the arts* What
is peculiar to poetry is its technique, and the
particular kind of emotional organisation which this technique
secures* None the less, an analysis of poetry should also throw
light on the technique of the other arts*
The other important artistic organisation effected by words
is the stoiy* How does the technique of poetry compare with
that of the story?
In a poem the affects adhere directly to die associations of the
words* The poet has to take care that the reader s mind does
not go out behind the words into the external reality they
describe before receiving the affects. It is quite otherwise with
the story* The story makes the reader project himself into the
world described; he sees the scene, meets the characters, and
experiences theit delays, mistakes and tragedies*
This technical difference accounts also for the more leisurely
character of the story* The reader identifies himself with the
poet;
to
both
the words
arise
already soaked with
affect,
already contsuning a portion of external reality* But the novel
arises
as
at
first
orly
an
impersonal
description
of
reality*
Nov-elist and the reader stand outside
it* They watch what
happensv They become sympathetic towards
characters* The
Q

24Z
illusion and reality
XI
characters
move
amid
familiar
scenes
which
arouse
their
emotions*
It seems
as if they walked into a world and used
their own judgment, whereas the world presented by the poet
is
already soaked
in
aflFective
colour*
Novel-readers do
not
immediately identify themselves with the novelist, as a reader
of poetry does with the poet* The reader of poetry seems to be
saying what the poet says, feeling his emotions* But the reader
of the story does not seem to be writing
it; he seems
to be
living through
it, in the midst of it* In the story,
therefore,
the affective tones cling to the associations of external reality*
The poem and the story both use sounds which awake images
of outer reality and affective reverberations; but in poetry the
aiffective reverberations are organised by the structure of the
language, while in the novel they are organised by the structure
of the outer reality portrayed*
In music the sounds do not refer to objects* They themselves
are
the
objects
of sense* To
them,
therefore,
the
affective
reverberations cling directly* Although the affective reverbera-
tions of poetry are organised by the structure of the language,
this structure itself is dependent on the ^^meaning^^
ue. on
the external reality referred to* But the structure of music
is
self-sufficient; it does not refer to outer reality in a logical way*
Hence music^s structure itself has a large formal -and pseudo-
mathematical
component**
Its
pseudo-logical
rigour
of scale
and chord replaces the logical rigour of external meaning* Thus
in music,
poetry and the novel the sound symbol has three
different functions:
in the novel
it stands
for an
object
in
external reality; in poetry for a word-born mental complex of
affective reverberation and memory-image; in music for part
of a pseudo-external reality*
The
social
ego
or
subjective world
is
realised in
artistic
phantasy by the
distortion of the
external world* But
for a
world to be distorted into an
affective organisation
it must
have a structure which is not affective (subjective) but logical
(objective)*
Hence
the
socially
recognised
laws
of
music,
which
are pseudo-logical laws* They correspond to the laws
of
language,
also
socially
recognised,
which
are
pseudo-
objective and are distorted by poetry, but not by the novel,
which distorts the time and space of objective reality*

XI
THE ORGANISATION OF THE ARTS
243
A logical external world can only exist in space and time*
Hence the musical world exists in space and time* The space
is
the movement of the
scale,
so that a melody describes a
curve in space as well as enduring in time* Although a melody
extends in time,
it is organised spatially* Just as a mathematical
argument is static and quantitative, although it ''follows on'^
in time, so a melody is timeless and universally valid* It is a
generalisation,
corresponding
to
the
classificatory content of
science*
It
is colourless and bare of quality in
its essence*
It
draws from the ego a universal emotional attitude within the
limits of its argument*
Harmony introduces into music a temporal element* Just as
space can only be described in terms of time (a succession of
steps),
so time
can only be
described in terms of space
(a
space
of time
imagined
as
existing
simultaneously,
like
a
panorama)* Time
is
the emergence of qualities* Hence two
qualities sounding simultaneously describe time in terms of
space* Just as the evolutionary sciences import from external
reality a perspective of a whole field of qualities evolving (yet
here visualised by an all-seeing eye as already fully developed),
so harmony brings into music a whole rich field of temporal
enrichment and complexity*
It individualises music and con-
tinually creates new qualities* It was therefore no accident but
a
result of the way
in which the
bourgeoisie
"continually
revolutionises
its own basis", that the richest development of
harmony in music should have coincided with the Industrial
Revolution, the rise of the evolutionary sciences and a dialec-
tical view of life* There was a parallel temporal movement in
story and symphony*
It was
equally no
accident
that
this
musical development should have coincided with a technical
development which on the one hand facilitated the instrumental
richness of bourgeois orchestras, and on the other hand by its
increase of communications made men's lives and experiences
interweave and counterpoint each other like a symphony*
In the world of melo4y undifferentiated man faces a universal
nature or static society, precisely as in poetry* In the novel and
the world
of harmony
a man
contemplates
the
rich and
complex movement of the passions of men in a changing and
developing world*

Rhythm was prior to either melody or harmony if anthro-
pological
researches
are any
guide,
and we assumed
that
a
rhythmic dancing and shouting was the parent also of poetry*
The external world of music exists, not to portray the world
but to portray the genotype* The world has therefore to be
dragged into the subject; the subject must not be squeezed out
into the object* Rhythm, because
it shouts aloud the dumb
processes of the body^s secret life and negates the indifferent
goings-on of the external universe, makes the hearer sink deep
down into himself in a physiological introversion* Hence the
logical laws of music, in spite of their externality and materi-
ality, must
first of all pay homage to rhythm, must be dis-
torted by rhythm, must be arranged round the
breath and
pulse-beats and
dark
vegetative
life
of the
body* Rhythm
makes
the
bare world of sound,
in
all
its
impersonality,
a
human 2.nd fleshy world* Melody and harmony impress on it a
more
differentiated and refined humanity, but a great con-
ductor is known most surely by his time* The beating baton
of the conductor says to the most elaborate orchestra: ^‘All this
complex and architectural tempest of sound occurs
mstde the
human
body*^ The
conductor
is
the common
ego
visibly
present in the orchestra*
When man invented rhythm,
it was the expression of his
dawning self-consciousness which had separated itself out from
nature* Melody expressed this self as more than a body, as the
self of a member of a collective tribe standing in opposition to
the universal otherness of nature* Rhythm
is the feeling of a
man; melody the feeling of Man. Harmony is the feeling ofmen,
of a man conscious of himself as an individual,
living in a
world where
the
interweaving
lives
of
society
reflect
the
orchestral pageant of growing and developing nature*
Just as the rhythm of music is physiological and distorts the
object to
its pattern so as to draw
it into the body,
so the
periodicity and ordering which is the essence of mathematics is
'"natural'" and logical, and squeezes the ego out of the body
‘ into the .object, so that it follows the grain of external nature*
The collective members of the tribe do not conflict in their
broad
desires and do not require
a mutual self-adjustment
to
secure freedom
for
each,
because
the
possibility of large

inequalities of freedom does not arise. There is no real surplus
of freedom* The
life
of the
primitive
corresponds
almost
exactly to a blind necessity* So small is the margin that to rob
him
of much
is
to
rob him
of
life
itself*
Therefore
just
because it is, in the sum, so scanty, it is shared equally by all,
and Nature, not other men, is a man^s chief antagonist* But the
individuation
produced
by
the
division
of
labour
and
a
corresponding
increase
in
productivity,
raises
this
mutual
interplay of diflFerent characters in conflict to a vital problem*
Appearing first with the static and logical simplicity of tragedy,
it
is in bourgeois
civilisation developed as the novel with a
more
flexible and changing technique* The development of
orchesttation in music has a similar significance as a road to
freedom*
The decay of art due to the decline of bourgeois economy is

in music* Just

literature,
the
religion of capitalism—so music produces the affective massage
of jazz,
which
gratifies
the

conflicts
in which freedom
is won* Both
think to escape necessity by turning their backs on it and so
create yet another version of the bourgeois
revolt against
a
consciousness of social relations* In contrast to the escape from
proletarian misery in bourgeois literature, there rises an expres-
sion of petty bourgeois misery* This characteristic expression is
the anarchic bourgois
revolt,
the surrhlisme that attempts to
liberate
itself by denying all convention, by freeing both the
inner
and
outer
worlds
from
social-commonness
and
so
^
'releasing^ ^ art into the magical world of dream* In the same
way, petty bourgeois music advances through atonality to an
anarchic expression of the pangs of a dying class* The opium
of
the
unawakened
proletariat
mixes
with
the
phantastic
aspirations of the
fruitlessly rebellious lower stratum of the
bourgeoisie*
Because the world of music with
its
logical
structure
is
pseudo-external and drawn out of the genotype, like the logical
content of mathematics, the

experience*
Because
the
external
realitp
of music
is
self-
generated,
it is as if music directly manipulated the emotions
of men*
Language expresses both external reality and internal reality
—facts and feelings* It does so by symbols, by ^^provoking^' in
the psyche a memory-image which is the psychic projection of
a piece of external reality, and a feeling which
is the psychic
projection of an
instinct*
But language
is not a haphazard
group of symbols*
It must be organised* This organisation
is
given in the arrangement of the symbols but cannot be itself
symbolised by these symbols** Wittgenstein, to whom we owe
this conception, saw it as a projective correspondence between
the symbols and outer reality* But there
is also a projectivity
correspondence between the symbols and inner reality, and the
final shape or pattern is the result of a tension or contradiction
between the two organising forces* Both orderings are shared in
common with the thing projected* If this is a part of external
reality, we may say Symbols and symbolised share the
real
world;
if it is a projection of internal reality, they share the
same affective manifold or social ego* Considered separately,
these orderings are only abstractions* They cannot in concrete
language be separated* In concrete language only
their tense
mutual
relation
is
reflected,
and
this
is
the
subject-object
relation—^man^s active struggle with Nature*
In poetry the manifold distorted or organised by the affective
forces of the common ego is the logical or grammatical mani-
fold inhering in the arrangement and syntactical organisation
of the words
themselves* Of
course
this
corresponds
to
a
similar logical arrangement *^out there'' in the external reality
symbolised* It corresponds, but it is not the same and there-
fore permits an affective organisation more direct, '^languagy"
and
primitive
than
that
of
the
novel,
where
the
logical
manifold
organised by common
ego
is
^"out
there"
in
the
external reality symbolised* Hence poetry is more instinctive,
barbaric and primitive than the novel*
It belongs to the age
when the Word is new and has a mystic world-creating power*
It comes from a habit of mind whidi gives a magical quality to
names,
spells, formulae and lucky expressions*
It belongs to
the '*taken for granted" knowledge in language which, when

XI

247
we discover
it consciously—as in logic^s laws—stems to us a
new, unhuman and imperious reality* The poetic Word is the
Logos, the word-made-flesh,
the active will ideally ordering;
whereas
the
novel's word
is
the symbol,
the
reference,
the
conversationally pointing gesture*
In music the logical manifold
is the formal or structural
element in music, corresponding to the grammatical or syntac-
tical element in language* It comprises die stuff-ness, the con-
ventions,
laws,
scales,
permitted
chords,
and
instrumental
limitations of musical theory* It is the impersonal and external
element in music* This
is
distorted affectively in time and
space
by
rhythm,
melody
and
harmony*
Wovon man
nicht
sprechen kann^
dariiher muss man schweigen^ (^Vhereof one cannot
‘
speak,
thereof one must

silent"),
ended
Wittgenstein,
asserting in a mystical form that since language corresponds to
facts, it cannot speak of non-factual entities, but must fall back
on mystical intuition* This is untrue* By
arbitrarily limiting
the function of language Wittgenstein excludes
it from
the
provinces
it
has
long occupied
successfully*
It
is
precisely
art—^music,
poetry
and
the
novel—^which
speaks
in
the
affective manifold what man
nicht sprechen kann in the logical
manifold*
The even pulse of rhythmic time contrasts with the irregu-
larity of time successions observed in the outside world* Man
naturally seizes therefore on the few natural periodicities—day
and night, months and years* Hence the conception of order
and
therefore number
is
given
to
us
physiologically,
and
mathematical calculation consists in giving different names to
different
periodicity
groups;
at
first
digital
symbols,
later
separate written characters* The ego is projected on to external
reality to order it* Subjective affective periodicity is the parent
of number,
therefore in mathematics affective time must be
distorted by
orderings found
in
external
reality* The
outer
manifold
is
the main
organising
force*
In music
external
periodicity is affectively distorted to follow the instinctive ego*
The
affective
manifold
is
here
the
organising
force* The
musician
is
an
introverted
mathematician* The
^lightning

is an extraverted conductor*
To summarise:

24S
ILiUSION ANP REALITY
XI
Mathematics uses spatial orderings of periodicities drawn
from subjective
sources,
these periodicities being distorted
to conform with external realityt
Music uses affective orderings of periodicities drawn from
objective
sources,
these
periodicities
being
distorted
to
conform with internal reality*
In poetry the affective rhythm is logico-spatial, not affective-
temporal* Unlike the basic rhythrn of mathematics,
it
is not
distorted by
cognitive material*
It
asserts
the tempo of the
body
as
against that of environment* Metre denies
external
time,
the
indifferent
passing
on
of
changing
reality—^by
^^marking time*^ and drawing in the object to it.
Music,
language,
mathematics,
all mere
sounds,
can yet
symbolise the whole Universe and express the active relation of
internal to external reality* Why has sound, a simple physical
wave system, become so apt a medium for the symbolisation of
life in all its concreteness?
In the life of animals external reality has been explored by
three distance receptors round which, as Sherrington has shown,
the brain has evolved; these are physico-chemical smell, sound
and sight. On the whole light-wave reception has proved
its
superiority
for
this
purpose
and
sound
therefore
became
specialised
as
a medium
of
inter-species
communication*
Among birds and tree-apes this would follow naturally from
the
engrossment
of
eye-sense by
the demands
of balance,
aerial
or arboreal* Long have
cries—^mere sounds—been
the
simple
voice
of
the
instincts
among
the
warm-blooded
animals from which we evolve* Long have our ears been tuned
to respond with affective association to simple sounds* Birds,
with their quick metabolism the most emotional of animals,
express with sound the simple pattern of their instincts in an
endlessly repeated melodic line* But man goes a step further,
along
the
line
indicated by
the warning
cry of birds* The
demands
of economic
co-operation—^perhaps
for hunting-
made
essential the denomination of objects and processes in
external

Perhaps

reality with
lips and tongue, man modified an

XI

instinctive sound# a feeling-symbol, to serve also as the symbol
of
a
piece
of
external
reality*
Language was
born.
Man's
simple cries, born of feeling, of primitive sympathy, of gesture,
of persuasion, became plastic; the same cry now stood for a
constant piece of external reality,
as also for a constant judg-
ment of
it. Something was born which was music,
poetry,
science and mathematics in one but would with time fly apart
and
generate
all
the dynamism
of language
and
phantasy
between the poles of music and mathematics, as the economical
operation which was its basis also developed.
It
is no mere
arbitrary ordering of emotion which music
performs.
It
expresses something
that
is
inexpressible
in
a
scientific language framed to follow the external manifold of
reality.
It projects the manifold of the genotype.
It
tells us
something that we can know in no other way; it tells us about
ourselves.
The
tremendous
truths we
feel
hovering
in
its
cloudy reticulations are not illusions; nor are they truths about
external
realities. They are truths about ourselves, not as we
statically are, but as we are actively striving to become*
2
In addition to the sound-symbolical arts, there are the visual
or
plastic
arts—painting,
sculpture
and
architecture.
It
is
easier to see how these fit into our analysis. The visual sense-
in all animals, eked out by tactile corrections—has been that
sense used most consistently to explore external reality, while
the hearing sense has been used to explore that particular part
of external reality which consists of other genotypes. Sound
mediates between genotype and genotype—the animal hears
the enemy or the mate. Light mediates also between genotype
and non-genotypical portions of external reality.-
As a result, when we make a visual symbol of external reality,
such as a diagram or a drawing,
it is naturally made projective
of external reality and not merely symbolic. Except in onoma-
topoeia, words individually are not mechanically projective of
things like a photograph,, but are only symbolic and themfore
^'conventional''* A drawing, however,
is directly projective of

250
ILLUSION AND REALITY
XI
reality without necessarily the mediation of pseudo-gramma-
tical rules or conventions. This
is shown by the resemblance
between a drawing and a photograph.
In drawing and sculpture bits of external reality are projected
into a mock world, as in a drawing of a flower or a sculpture
of
a
horse.
This
picture must have
in common with
the
external reality from which it is drawn something not describ-
able in terms of itself—the real or logical manifold or, more
simply, the ^likeness"\
But line and colour also have affective associations in their
own right. These must be organised in an attitude towards the
mock world, the ^Thing"' projected. This must be an affective
attitude, which is what the painting or sculpture has in common
with the genotype, or affective manifold, and cannot be itself
symbolised by a drawing, since it
is inherent in the drawing.
To the naive observer this appears as a distortion in the drawing
as a non-likeness to external reality. But of course it is really
a likeness, a likeness to the affective world of the genotype.
For the purpose of this brief survey, the only distinction that
need be made between painting and sculpture
is that one
is
three-dimensional
and
the
other
two-dimensional.
Thus
painting selects two out of the three dimensions of external
reality—or rather to be accurate, it selects two out of the four
dimensions, for unlike music, poetry and the story, the plastic
arts lack the fourth dimension, time. Pictures do not begin at
one moment in time and end at another. They are static; they
do not change. All
arts must select from external
reality in
some way, otherwise they would not have any looseness at the
joints to give play for ego-organisation. They must have one
degree of freedom.
Line and colour, symbolising real objects,
are organised ^by
the
‘ego-reality
projected. The
result
is
a new
emotional
attitude to a piece of reality. After viewing a Rembrandt or a
Cfeanne we su the exterior world differently. We still see ^he
same
external
reality, but
it
is drenched wiA new affective
tones and shines with
a bright emotional
colouring.
It
is a
more
^^appetising'^
world,
for
it
is
the
appetitive
instincts
which furnish the aesthetic affects.
Plainly
the same
criteria we have
already
established
for

language hold good
here* A Michael Angelo painting or
a
Dutch portrait contains more of external re^ity than a Picasso,
just
as a story contains more than a poem* But what
is the
scope and degree of the emotional reorganisation in the visual
field
that
it
effects?
It
is
chiefly on
this
that the
varying
estimates of greatness in painting are based* Just as in music
or poetry,
so in painting, easy solutions or shallow grasps of
reality are poor art*
Painting resembles poetry in this much, that the aflFects do
not inhere in the associations of the things, but in the lines
and forms and colours that compose them* Certain scenes—for
example a funeral—^have
affective associations in themselves*
But the affective associations used by painting do not pertain
to the funeral as an event but to a brownish rectangle in a large
transparent box with circles at the end drawn by greyish horse-
shapes* The affective associations adhering to ideas of bereave-
ment could quite properly be used in a story, and the novelist
could
legitimately bring in a
funeral in order
to
utilise
its
aflFective
associations
in
his
pattern*
Again
the mere
word
’^'funerar^ as a word has of course inherent affective associations
which can be used in poetry—the ^Tuneral of my hopes*'
but only if it is thoroughly understood that the whole group
of such linguistic associations will be brought into the poem,
and must either be utilised or inhibited,
e.g. suggestions of
darknesSj of purple^ of stujffy respectability
of a procession^ or pomp
and ceremony i of deep wells (sound association with funnel plus
the grave). The affective associations used by painting are only
those of colour, line and combinations of colour and line, but
they are used to organise the, meaning—^the real object repre-
sented.
Hence the static plastic arts which are representational are
akm to poetry and mathematics—to the classificatory sciences
and the universal arts* Just as we slip at once into the '1" of
the poem, so we slip at once into the viewpoint of the painter*
We see the world both from where the poet and where the
painter stands*
We have
already explained why
this approach leads
to a
**a:ibal" primitive attitude to living, why it tends to lead to
the realisation of a static universal human essence opposed to a

ILLUSION AND REALITY
XI
252
Static nature, and
is
therefore
the best medium
for voicing
universal cries of passion or insight* By a paradox which is not
really a paradox, but
is given in the nature of individuation,
poetry and painting are also the best mediums for expressing
individuality—the
individuality
however
only
of
the
poet*
Painting,
poetry and melody ^1 have this in common—this
timeless universal quality of the human gems rather than the
interesting sub-complications of a group of human individuals*
Hence too we find painting developed at an early stage in the
history of civilisation—as early as Palaeolithic man*
In
its
first appearance painting
is man^s
consciousness of
affective quality in Nature, hence the
* life-like*" character of
early Palaeolithic Art, when it deals with natural subjects* But
with the development of man from a group of hunters and food-
gatherers to a crop-raising and cattle-rearing tribe, man passes
from a co-operating observation of Nature, seeking his own
desires in
it, to a co-operative power over Nature, by drawing
it into the tribe and domesticating it* Hence he is now inter-
ested in the power of social forms over reality, which becomes
^convention"*
in perceptual rendering* Therefore naturalistic
Palaeolithic
Art
becomes
in
Neolithic
days
conventional,
arbitrary and sjicnbolic^iecoratm. Not only does this prepare
the way for
^writing, but it also expresses a psychic change in
culture similar to the passage from rhythm to poetry and to
melody*
The passage from the gens or tribe to class society is marked
by a further differentiation in pictorial art which takes
the
form of a return of
^^naturalism"*,
but man now
seeks
in
Nature, not the affective qualities of the solid tribe, but the
heightened and specialised qualities of the ruling class* These
are elaborated by the division of labour and the greater tech-
nical power and penetration of Nature
this makes
possible.
This naturalism is always ready to fall back into ^^convention-
ality"* when a
class ceases
to be vitally in touch with active
reality and its former discoveries ossify into dry shells* Natur-
alism becomes academicism* The most naturalistic pictorial art
is bourgois
art, corresponding to
its greater productivity- and
differentiation and more marked division of labour* Hence the
rise of naturalism in bourgeois art, and its revolutionary self-

XI
THE ORGANISATION OF THE ARTS
253
movement,
is connected with the rise of harmony in music and
of the evolutionary sciences generally during the same period*
Naturalism must not be confused with realism—^for example
the realism of bourgeois Flemish painting* This realism too
may be conventional* Since painting is like poetry, and not the
novel, the vital ego-organisation which
is the basis of natur-
alism does not take place in the real world depicted, but flows
from the complex of memory-images and affective reverbera-
tions awakened by the line or colour, and is organised by the
^ ^meaning'', by the projective characteristics of the painting*
In later bourgeois culture economic diiSFerentiation becomes
crippling and coercive instead of being the road to individua-
tion of freedom* There is a reaction against content, which, as
long as it remains within the bourgeois categories, appears as
' ^commodity-fetishism"** The
socid
forms which make
the
content marketable and give it an exchange value are elevated
as ends in themselves* Hence, cubism, futurism, and various
forms of so-called ^abstract"" art*
Finding himself ultimately enslaved by the social form and
therefore
still
^^bound
to
the
market"",
the
bourgeois
rebel
attempts to shake himself free even from the social ego and so
to escape into the world of dream where both ego and external
world are personal and unconscious* This is surrialisme^ with the
apparent
return
of
a
realism which
is
however
fictitious,
because
it
is
not
the
real,
social
external world which
returns, but the unconscious personal world* We have already
explained
why
surrealisme
represents
the
final
bourgeois
position*
3
The plastic arts are
static* A visual art moving in time
is
provided in the dance, the drama and (finally) the film* The
dance
is
primitive story—quality
separating
itself from
the
womb of rhythm* In the dance, rhythm gradually ceases to be
physiological and
begins
to
unfold
in time and
share
the
qualitative movement of reality, in which things happen*
Painting
shares with poetry
the
quality of having
affects
organised by the projective structure of the symbols* (A black

ILLUSION AND REALITY
XI
254
oblong, not a coiffin*) But directly the visual arts move in time
this
spatial or pseudo-grammatical organisation
is no longer
possible and therefore it must take place as in the story—the
affective
organisation
is
an
organisation
of
the
real
object
symbolised by the visual representation* (The real coffin*) The
courtship of the dance, the murder on the stage, the riot on the
films are the material which is afFectively organised, and not the
linked forms, prostrate figure, or scattered crowd, considered as
a projective structure, as would be the case if they were frozen
into
a
static tableau* This confusion between the projective
organisation of the static arts and the real organisation of the
temporal
arts leads to
all kinds of special expressionistic and
scenic theories of drama—for example those of Edward Gordon
Craig* The development of the ballet, the drama and the film
is
the
equivalent
of the development
of harmony,
of
the
counterpoint of individuals whose life-experiences
criss-cross
against a changing background of Nature because the division
of labour has wrought a similar differentiation and individua-
tion within the crystal of the collective tribe* Tragedy appears
in the rapid evolution of Greek classes out of the Greek gens
and blossoms again with the rise of bourgeois productivity in
the drama of the Elizabethan stage* In both, foetry still soaks
it because the drama is a transitional stage in class society* It is
the
product
of
a
society
passing
from
collectivity
to
individuality*.
The dance, the drama and the film are mixed or counter-
pointed
in
their
technique
as
compared
to
the
affective
organisations of language arid music. Just as music's sounds are
the objects of external reality and not symbols of such objects,
so the dancing or acting human being or the scenery around
him
is
the
real
object*
Admittedly,
the
dancing
or
acting
human being
also
refers
to another
object
(the
courting
or
dying human he mimics)* But he is also an object of external
reality in himself—a gracefully- or attractively-moving human
being*
Hence
acting
and
dancing
have
a
musical
*^non-
symbolical component", but they
also have
the
other com-
ponent,
the
characteristic of referring
to
objects
of external
reality* There
is a double organisation—^the thing mimicked
and the person mimicking* This double
organisation has
a

XI

255
certain danger, and gives rise to a quarrel between actor and
author, cast and producer, which can to-day only be overcome
in the
film, where the mechanical
flexibility of the camera
makes the cast wax in a good producer’s hands* However in an
era of bourgeois individualism this feature of the film cannot
be fully explored, and the film remains a "^starring” vehicle,
except in Soviet Russia*
The dancer or actor as himself
^
as an object of contemplation,
is static^ like tjie poetic word* The reality symbolised is like the
reality of story’s objects—in movement* Hence there is a tension
in a play or film between the static close-up or actor’s instant
and the moving action or author’s organisation—this resembles
the
tension
in an
epic between
the
poetic
instant and the
narrative movement*
The individual passages in epic or play that we conceive of as
particularly poetic or histrionic—Homer’s description of the
stars of heaven opening out, or the great moment of a Duse
are almost like music: the affects are attached to the words or
actions and only released by the meaning,
as
if a dam had
burst* The play or epic halts* There is a poetic instant and as
time vanishes, space enters; the horizon expands and becomes
boundless* The art reveals itself as double* The things described
in turn have their own affects which are organised by the action
of the story or the play in time* It
is* this that makes us think
of the Iliad and the Odyssey as substantial and spacious worlds,
stretching back as far as the eye can reach. In the great Shakes-
pearean plays we feel this double organisation as a world of vast
cloudy
significance,
not
orJy looming
vaguely
behind
the
action but in the poetic passages actuJly casting lights on it
from underneath,
so that the action itself is subtly modified
and glows with unexpected fluorescence* Hence the difi6cult7
of acting poetic plays* Action and poetry go together because
they live in
different structures* But poetry and
acting—the
of the poet and the
of the
actor,
are in the^same
structure and
blot
each
other
out*
Irving s
Hamlet
,
or
Shakespeare’s—^we have
to
choose* In a play which
is read,
poetry can take the place of acting, hence the satisfaction from
reading Shakespeare’s
plays not to be
paralleled by reading
Ibsen’s* Of course in Shakespeare’s time the actor was
less

256

Xl
dominating*
as
is shown by the use of boys to take women's
parts*
The same
characteristic and good mixture of the real and
symbolised objects which is to be found in dance and drama
is
to be
distinguished from
the same mixture
occasionally
found in music—the bastard kind of music in which nightin-
gales sing, monastery bells toll, and locomotives whistle* These
real
objects, mimicked or symbolised by sound,
disturb the
logical
self-consistent
structure
of music's
world,
and
are
therefore here impermissible*
In Palaeolithic Art the individual
is only self-conscious and
is still anchored in the perception of the object, giving rise to
an atomic naturalism of exactly-portrayed, unorganised percept-
things*
So
in
the dance of hunting
primitives,
the
natural
object—the animal—is mimicked unaltered because
it
is only
sought by man, not changed* The object draws the ego out of
man in Accurate perception* It is gained in cO-operation and so
becomes conscious, a fact which differentiates its qualities from
those
it possesses in brute perception, but
it
is sought,
not
created*
In
Neolithic
Art, when
hunting
or
food-gathering man
becomes a crop-raising or cattle-rearing tribe, the object is not
ime-rely -sought by society but changed by it* The man realises
hiihself in the percept as social man, as the tribe changing the
object according to conventions and forms rooted in the means
of communication* The dance becomes the formal
hietatic
movement of chorus and incipient tragedy* The hunting or
food-gatbering primitive's dance
is violently naturalistic and
mimicking;
the
food-raising or
cattle-rearing dance has
the
formality of a religious
rite and reveals the impress of the
tribe's soul on Nature* It emphasises the magical and wotld-
goveruing power of the
gesture* The
circling sun obeys the
circling dancer; the crop lifts with the leaping of young men;
life quickens with the dizzy motion* The tribe draws Nature
into its bosom*
The elaboration of class-socie’ty causes the dance to develop
into a story, into a play^ The intricacies of the chorus loosen
‘sufiSciently
to
permit
the
emergence
of
individual
players*
Individuation, produced by the division of labour in a
class

society,
is reflected in the tragedy* A god, a hero, a priest-king,
people,
great men,
detach diemselves from
the chorus and
appear on the stage, giving birth simultaneously to the static
acting and the moving action which were inseparably one in the
danced chorus,
just as were the static poem and the moving
story one
in the
ritual
chant, where the word
is
poetically
world-creating and yet also relates a mythical story*
Of course the decay and rigidity of a class society
is at any
moment
reflected
in
a
stiffening
and
typification
of
the
characters^'* The individuation is not rooted in the class but
in the division of labour* The class cleavage at first makes this
division possible but at a certain moment denies
its further
development
and
becomes
a
brake,
a
source
of academic
ossification, a corset which society must break or be stifled*
We said that the cathedrals were bourgeois and not feudal,
that
they
were
already
Protestant
heresies
in
the
heart
of
Catholicism,
the
bourgeois town
developing
in
the
feudal
country* Hence the bourgeois play begins in the cathedrals as
the mystery play frowned on by the Church authorities* When
the monarchy allies itself with the bourgeois class, the mystery
moves to court and becomes the Elizabethan tragedy* Here the
individual
is realised once again naturaHstically as the prince,
as the social will incarnate in the free desires of the hero*
Because of the special development of bourgeois individuality,
after Shakespeare the mimed action falls a victim to the static
actor* In Greek tragedy the actor' is swaddled in the trappings
of cothurni and mask; he
is the pure vehicle of poetry and
action* In the Elizabethan play the actor's personality
is
still
stifled, and because
the
actor
is
subordinate
to
the mimed
action the play
is
still poetic* In our day the actor's instant
conflicts with
the
poet's;
in
Shakespeare's
the boy-woman,
muffled in the collective representations of the feudal court,
was
still
a hollowness which gave room
for
the
poetry of
Cleopatra
to come
forward and
expand* The
incursion
of
woman on to the stage marks the rise of acting in the drama,
and the death of narrative and poetry* The personal individual
actor or actress becomes primary; his social relations with others
or with the social ego—^which constitute the story or poetry of
the play—become secondary* The play, because of the collective

basis
of

is
injured hy
the
individualism
of
bourgeois culture*
The play,
like painting, becomes increasingly realistic and
then moves over to commodity-fetishism—the abstract struc-
ture
of Expressionism
in which
the
conventions
or
social
forms are hypostatised, and the content or ^^story"' is expelled,
so that the play aspires towards the impossibility of becoming
the pure social ego* And the play finally makes a bid to cut
itself off both from social ego and external reality according to
the mechanism of surrealiste dream-work*
This same
basic movement
is only what we have
already
analysed
in
poetry*
For
the
cry,
reproducing the
authentic
image (the bird call or animal cry) in the dance of the hunting
primitive, becomes the elaborate chant or choral hymn, with
strophe, antistrophe and epode, in the crop-raising or pastoral
society which
has
sucked
Nature
into
its
undifferentiated
bosom* The rise of class society and its individuation, based on
division of labour,
is reflected in the emergence of the bard,
with his epic poetry, glorifying the deeds of heroes, stories in
which he does not speak for himself but for a general class, and
so his own persondi instant does not conflict with a poetic
instant which
is only given in
the
acts of heroes* But
the
further individuation of society, due to still greater division of
labour, gives rise to the
with his lyrical verse—amatory,
epistolary and personal—^in which the poetic instant coincides
with the personal instant, in which the collective
(formerly
general and heroic) has become personal and individual* With
this goes a natur^ism and
^^pathos^^ of the kind for which
Euripides was reproached by
his
contemporaries and which
seems to bourgeois culture so appealing and right*
The poet finds his full individuation in bourgeois poetry,
where chanted
lyrical poetry becomes written study poetry,
and the social ego of poetry
is identified with the free indi-
vidual* Here
too
there
is movement through naturalism
to
escape from the external world (symbolism) and escape also from
the social ego (surrealismi).

XI
THE ORGANISATION OF THE ARTS
4
Architecture
and
the
‘'applied'*
arts
(ceramics,
weaving,
design of clothes, furniture, machines, cars, printed characters
and the like) play a role in the visual field similar to that of
music
in the
aural
field in
that
the
“things"
are
parts
of
external reality and are “distorted" or organised directly by the
affects* But
architecture and
the
other
arts
are like
inverted
music* The “external" element
is not a formal ideal “struc-
ture"
as in music, with its pseudo-logical laws, but a human
and social function* The external reality' of a house or vase is
its use—its coveringness or its capaciousness* This use-form is
organised or distorted affectively either by the symbolisation of
natural
external
reality
(as when
a
carpet,
vase or house
is
covered with sculpture or decoration) or when it is given shape,
balance,
harmony,
curves
and movement
in
space*
This
organisation is poetic; the “I" which organises the use-function
is static and collective* Great architecture arises in the womb
of a society where social “I" and individual “I" do not conflict
but reinforce each other*
Hunting man expresses the use-value realistically* He. finds
in Nature the correspondence to his use* His house is a cave;
his vase a gourd; his weapon a rough flint; his covering a skin.
In this sense his applied art is as realistic as his drawings*
Crop-raising or pastoral man imposes on his materialised use-
value
a
decoration which
is conventional and distorting* He
takes Nature
into
the bosom
of the
tribe,
and moulds
it
plastically to his wish* The use-value is given a social form
it
is minted* The stone implements are polished* Instead of
seeking out a cave, he erects a rough hut in a convenient spot*
He no longer clothes himself in skins; his covering is woven*
Instead of gourds, he uses
pottery, moulded to a shape and
decorated*
The birth of a
class society
sees the birth of palaces and
temples where “coveringness" is affectively organised to express
the majesty and sacredness of a ruling class* This majesty and
sacredness has accrued through the division of labour and the
alienation of property whereby the increased social power seems
to gather at .the pole of the ruling class at the same time as the

z6o
ILLUSION AND REALITY
XI
humility and abasement appears at the pole of the slave class.
With the merchant
class of Athens and Rome
this
reflects
itself also in municipal buildings. In feudal society castles and
basilicas express the affective organisation of social power* The
cathedral and the
hotel
de
ville of medieval town life already
reflect
the
growing power
of
the
bourgeois
class
and
are
rebellious. The bourgeois class is still collective—it is gathered
in self-governing and self-arming communes—tribal islands in
the pores of feudalism* At first dieir social expansion appears in
the palaces and cathedrals of princes, who wield for a time the
power of the bourgeoisie against other feudal powers. Then it
passes
into
aristocratic villas and
State
structures;
finally,
it
appears in the form of gentlemen^s residences* At first this
is
a naturalistic movement* Houses become
less
^Tormal'^ and
more
useful and domestic*
This movement too
passes
into
abstraction*
Abstraaion
in
painting
is
functionalism
in
architecture.
Finally
even
the
social
ego
is
negated
and
architecture shows everywhere freakishness and personal whim,
irrespective of the needs of function. The same movement of
course takes place in ceramics,
textiles and other applied arts*
In general the products of a class society in this field show the
same rich elaboration and aesthetic idealisation of the aims and
aspirations of the ruling class as do the other forms of art.

Obviously the arts can also be arranged historically—^begin-
ning from
their
confused appearance
in food-gathering- and
hunting-man to their complex development in a class society
where individuation
is possible* We have already dealt with
this movement
in
general* The
three main
periods
are
all
sublated in modern
art's methods of subjective organisation
which
therefore
include
the
consciousness
of man
seeking
himself in Nature, of man drawing Nature into the social but
undiflFerentiated
of the tribe, and finally of man splitting
the
social *1"
into
living
individuals and
at the same time
resolving Nature into a differentiated universe which evolves.
If we are asked the purpose of art, we can make an answer
the precise nature of it depending on what we mean by purpose.
Art has
* ^survived"; cultures containing art have outlived and
replaced those that have not, because art adapts the psyche to
the
environment, and
is
therefore one of die conditions of
the development of society* But we get another answer if we
ask iow.art performs its task, for it does this by taking a piece
of environment and distorting
it, giving
it a non-likeness to
external
reality which
is
also a likeness to the genotype*
It
remoulds external reality nearer to the likeness of the genotype's
instincts, but since the instinctive genotype is nothing but an
unconscious and dynamic desire
it remoulds
external reality
nearer
to the
heart's
desire* Art becomes
ratore
socially and
biologically
valuable
and
greater
art
the
more
that
re-
moulding is comprehensive and true to the nature of reality,
using, as
its material the sadness, the catastrophes, the blind
necessities,
as well as the delights and pleasures of life* An
organism which thinks
life
is
all
*Tor the best in the best
possible of worlds" will have
little survival value* Great art
can thus be great tragedy, for here, reality at
its bitterest—

262
ILLUSION AND REALITY
X
death, despair, eternal failure—is yet given an organisation, a
shape, an affective arrangement which expresses a deeper and
more social view of fate* By giving external reality an affective
organisation drawn from
its
heart,
the genotype makes
all
reality, even death, more interesting because more
true* The
world glows with interest; our hearts go out to it with appetite
to encounter
it, to live in
it, to get to grips with it* A great
novel is how we should like our own lives to be, not petty or
dull, but full of great issues, turning even death to a noble
sound:
Notre vie est noble et tragique
Comme le masque d^un tyran
Nul drame hazardeux et magique
Aucun detail indifferent
Ne rend notre amour pathetiquei
A great picture is how we should like the world to look to us
brighter, full of affective colour* Great music is how we should
like our emotions
to run on,
full of strenuous purpose and
deep aims* And because, for a moment, we saw how it might
be, were given the remade object into our hands, for ever after
we tend to make our lives less petty, tend to look around us
with a more-seeing eye, tend to feel richly and strenuously*
If we ask why
art, by making the environment wear the
expression of the genotype, comes to us with the nearness and
significance it does, we must say still more about art^s essence*
In making external reality glow with our expression, art tells
us about ourselves* No man can look directly at himself, but
art makes of the Universe a mirror in which we catch glimpses
of ourselves, not as we are, but as we are in active potentiality
of becoming in relation to reality through society* The genotype
we see is the genotype stamped with all the possibilities and
grandeur of mankind—an
elaboration which
in
its
turn
is
extracted by society from the rest of reality* Art gives us so
many glimpses of thie inner heart of life; and that is its signifi-
cance, different from and yet arising out of its purpose* It is
like
a magic
lantern which
projects
our
real
selves on the
Universe and promises us that we, as we desire, can alter the
1 Apollinaire,

XI
THE ORGANISATION OF THE ARTS
263
Universe,
alter
it to the measure of our needs. But to do so,
we must know more deeply our real needs, must make our-
selves
yet more
conscious
of ourselves. The more we
grip
external reality, the more our art develops and grows increas-
ingly subtle, the more the magic lantern show takes on new
subtleties
and
fresh
richnesses.
Art
tells
us
what
science
cannot tell us, and what religion only feigns to tell us—^what
we are and why we are, why we hope and suffer and love and
die.
It does not
tell us
this
in the language of science,
as
theology and dogma attempt to do, but in the only language
that can
express
these
truths,
the language of inner
reality
itself, the la4guage of affect and emotion. And its message is
generated by our attempt to
realise
its
essence
in an
active
struggle with Nature, the struggle called
life.
All
this
is
only the inverse picture of what science
does.
Science too has a survival value and a purpose, and it
fulfils
this by adapting external reality to the genotype just as
art
adapts the genotype to external reality. Just as art achieves its
adaptative purpose by projecting the genotype^s inner desires
on to external reality, so science achieves its end by receiving
the orderings of external reality into the mind, in the phan-
tastic mirror-world of scientific ideology. Necessity, projected
into
the
psyche,
becomes
conscious
and man
can mould
external reality to his will. Just as art, by adapting the genotype
and projecting its features into external reality,
tells us what
the
genotype
is,
so
science,
by
receiving
the
reflection
of
external reality into the psyche, 'tells us what external reality
is. As art tells us the significance and meaning of all we are in
the language of feeling, so science tells us the significance of all
we see in the language of cognition. One is temporal, full of
change; the other spatial and seemingly static. One alone could
not generate a phantastic projection of the whole Universe, but
together, being contradictory, they are dialectic, and call into
being the spatio-temporal, historic Universe; not by themselves
but by the
practice,
the
concrete
living, from which they
emerge. The Universe that emerges is explosive, contradictory,
dynamically moving apart, because those are the characteristics
of the movement of reality which produced
it, the movement
of human life.

ILLUSION AND REALITY
XI
264
Art and science play contradictory and yet intermingled r61es
in the sphere of theory* Science in cognition gives art a pro-
jected selection from external reality which art organises and
makes affectively appealing, so that the energy of the genotype
is directed towards imposing its desires on that external reality*
Thus,
attention,
moving
inwards from
action,
through
art
moves
outwards
again
to
action*
Attention
to
change
of
externals causes the inward movement of cognition; attention
to change of internals the outward movement of action* For
the outward-moving energy to effect its aim, science is again
needed, and the original memory-images, now modified affec-
tively, must be rescanned to grasp their inner relationships so
that the desires of the genotype can be
effected*
Science
in
cognition now becomes science in action*
In
effecting those
desires with the aid of existing memory-images, more know-
ledge
is gained of the
real orderings of external
reality*
Its
object achieved, attention returns with fresh empirical experi-
ence to add to its treasure* This richer content is again organised
affectively by the genotype, and again flows outwards as energy
directed to an end* Energy is always flowing out to the environ-
ment of society, and new perception always flowing in from it;
as we change ourselves, we change the world; as we change the
world we learn more about it; as we learn more about
it, we
change ourselves; as we change ourselves, we learn more about
ourselves; as we learn more about that we are, we know more
clearly what we want* This is the dialectic of concrete life in
which associated men struggle with Nature* The genotype and
the external
reality
exist separately
in
theory,
but
it
is an
abstract separation* The greater the separation, the greater the
unconsciousness of each* The complete separation gives us on
the one hand the material body of a man, and on the other
hand the unknown environment* Spreading from the point of
interaction,
the psyche, two vast spheres of light grow out-
wards simultaneously; knowledge of external
reality,
science;
knowledge of ourselves,
art* As
these
spheres
expand,
they
change the material they dominate by interaction with each
other* The conscious sphere of the genotype takes colour from
the known sphere of external reality and vice versa. This change
—change in heart, change in the face of the earth—is not just

XI
THE ORGANISATION OF THE ARTS
Z65
a consequence of the expansion of the two circles,
it is the two
expansions,
just
as
the
flash of light
is
the electromagnetic
wave ^oup* As man becomes increasingly free and therefore
increasingly
himself
by
growing
increasingly
conscious of
Necessity, so Necessity becomes increasingly orderly and 'law-
abiding*', increasingly itself, as it falls increasingly within the
conscious grasp of the 'genotype*
Art
therefore
is
all
active
cognition,
and
science
is
all
cognitive action* Art in contemplation is all active organisation
of the subject of cognition, and in action all active organisation
of the
object of cognition*
Science
in contemplation
is
all
cognitive organisation of the subject of action, and in action all
cognitive
organisation
of
the
object
of
action*
The
link
between science and art, the reason they can live in the same
language, is this: the subject of action is the same as the subject
of cognition—the genotype* The object of action
is the same
as the object of cognition—external reality* Since the genotype
is
a
part of
reality,
although
it
finds
itself set up
against
another part of it, the two interact; there is development; man's
thought and man's society have a history*
Art is the science of feeling, science the art of knowing. We
must know to be able to do, but we must feel to know what
to do*
Art is born in struggle, because there is in society a conflict
between phantasy and
reality*
It
is
not a
neurotic
conflict
because
it
is a social problem and is solved by the artist for
society.
Psycho-analysts do not see the poet playing a social
function, but regard him as a neurotic working off his com-
plexes at the expense of the public* Therefore in analysing a
work of art, psycho-analysts seek just those symbols that are
peculiarly
private,
i*^*
neurotic, and hence psycho-analytical
c;riticism of. art finds
its examples and material always either
in
third-rate
artistic work or in accidental
features of good
work* In Hamlet they see an Oedipus-complex; but they do not
see that this does not explain the universal power of the great
speeches, or the equal greatness of Antony and Cleopatra^ which
cannot be analysed into an Oedipus complex*
The psycho-analyst can sometimes
cure the
neurotic who
cannot cure himself unaided, because he provides a force or

266
ILLUSION AND REALITY
XI
point of leverage outside the psyche of the neurotic* He
is a
member of society, and can therefore work from the outside
inwards,
into
the
socially
created
conscious
psyche,
the
neurotic's
'^better
self", and
so
attack
the unconscious,
his
'Vorse
self".
The
better
self,
the
conscious
psyche,
the
conscience
j
is
society's
creation,
while
the
"worse
self"
is
genotypical, the animal in us.
The psycho-analyst is only one man, and is also the possessor
of a worse self which may get between himself and his patient.
He is a luxury who can be afforded only by the well-to-do. In
art,
all
society, the sum of
all conscious psyches engaged in
social creation, speaks to a man's "better self". All the better
part
of
humanity,
endlessly
attacking
and
solving
life's
problems, stands ranged behind the artistic culture of a nation.
They are men not gods; like him they suffered and fought, but
when they died they left behind the enduring essence of their
transitory lives. Hence the consoling, healing and invigorating
power of art.
The
emotional
attitude of the
neurotic
or
the
psychotic
towards reality is permanent. That of the poet in creation, or
the reader in experiencing, is temporary. The essence of genuine
illusion is that it is non-symbolic and plastic. The neurotic
is
deluded because the complex is in his unconscious; he
is un-
free. The artist is only illuded because the complex is in his
conscious; he is free. We take up the attitude when reading a
poem, and experience the emotions, and then when the poem
has been experienced the attitude is thrown away. The attitude
was released by the conscious emotions; as the neurotic attitude
may be unfrozen if he becomes conscious of the complex; as the
sleeper wakes if the stimulus demands willed-action. The artist
releases the autonomous complex in a work of art and'^Torgets"
it, goes on to create anew, to experiment again with the eternal
adaptation of the genotype to
its eternally changing environ-
ment. If poetry becomes religion, if the non-symbolic is taken
to be symbolic, the emotional attitude becomes frozen like the
neurotic
attitude.
Thus
the
value
of
poetry's
illusions
in
securing
catharsis,
as compared to
religion's,
is that they are
known for illusion, and as compared to dream, that they are
social.

XI
THE ORGANISATION OF THE ARTS
267
If poetry s emotional attitudes pass, what is their value? It is
this;
experience
leaves
behind
it
a
trace
in memory.
It
is
stored by the organism and modifies
its action. The Universe
to-day is not what it was a million years ago, because it is that
much more full of experience, and that much more
historic.
Society is not what it was two thousand years ago, because its
culture has lived through much and experienced much. So too
a wise man, in the course of his life, has endured and experi-
enced. He has not acquired knowledge of external reality only,
for such a man we
call merely
^^^earned'^ and think of his
learning as something arid, devoid of richness. The wise man
has also learned about himself. He has had emotional experience.
It is because of this double experience that we call him wise,
with a ripeness,
a
poise,
a sagacity given to him by
all his
history. Of course neither science nor art are substitutes for
concrete living: they are guide-books to it.
The wisdom of a culture, our social heritage, inheres both in
its science and its
art. Either alone is one-sided wisdom, but
both together give ripe sagacity, the vigour and serenity of an
organism sure of itself in the face of external reality.
What, then,
is the illusion of art? In what does
it consist?
Not in the affective element, for artistic emotion is consciously
experienced, and is therefore real and true. Real and true as
applied to emotion mean, simply: Has it existed in reality?
Has
it been present in a psyche? The emotion of poetry is
certainly real in this sense. The illusion of poetry must there-
fore inhere in the piece of external reality to which the emotion
is attached—^in poetry to the meaning, in novel to the story.
The purpose of this piece of external reality was to provide a
subject for the affect, because an affect is a conscious judgment,
and must therefore be a judgment of something. Art is therefore
affective experimenting with selected pieces of external reality.
The situation corresponds to a scientific experiment. In this a
selected piece of external reality is set up in the laboratory. It
is a mock world, an imitation of that part of external reality
in which the experimenter is interested. It may be an animal's
heart in a physiological salt solution, a shower of electrified
droplets between two plates, or an aerofoil in a wind tunnel.
In each case there is a ‘Take" piece of the world, detached so as

ILLUSION AND REALITY
XI
z68
to be handled conveniently, and illusory in this much, that it
is not actually what we meet in real life, but a selection from
external reality arranged for our own purposes* It is an *"as if'\
In the same way the external reality symbolised in scientific
reasoning is never all external reality, or a simple chunk of it,
but a selection from
it* The difference between art's piece of
reality and science's
is that science
is only interested in the
relation of that selected piece to the world from which it
is
drawn, whereas
art
is interested in the relation between the
genotype and the selected piece of reality, and therefore ignores
the whole world standing behind the part*
If by the words
^'mock world", we denote the illusory piece of external reality,
the symbolical part alike of poetry and science, we get
this
relation:
External Reality
Mock World
Social Eg(
Science
Art
Hence
it
is
just
^hllusion"
that
art and
science
have
in
common. The
distinctive
concern
of
science
is
the world
of
external
reality;
art
is
occupied with
the world
of internal
reality* The
ordering
or
logical
manifold
characteristic
of
scientific language is that internal structure in its mock world
projected from the relationships of external reality. The order-
ing or affective manifold characteristic of artistic language
is
that internal structure in its mock world projected from the
relationships
of
internal
reality*
Hence
another
schematic
representation:
the World
experienced
by Art
MATTER
The World
coemised
by Science
But since the genotype is itself a part of external reality, we
can also represent it thus:

XI
THE ORGANISATION OF THE ARTS
THE MOCK WORLD
THE
SOCIAL
EGO
SCIENCE 8t ART
Hence science and art together are able to symbolise a com-
plete Inverse which includes the genotype itself. Each alone
is partial, but the two halves together make a whole, not as
fitted together, but as they interpenetrate man’s struggle with
Nature in the process of concrete living.

XII
THE FUTURE OF POETRY
I
The future was once a place to which one relegated one's hopes
and aspirations: a place where one took revenge for the world's
unkindness
by
holding
its
future
richness
to
the
narrow
categories of the present*
Of the
future one
can only dream—^with
greater
or
less
success* Yet to dream is not to associate ‘Treely" but to have
certain phantasies, a certain reshuffling of memory-images of
past reality blended and reorganised in a new way, because of
certain real causes in present reality* Even dream is determined^
and a movement in dream reflects perhaps a real movement into
daylight of material phenomena at present unrecognised* That
is why it is possible to dream with accuracy of the future—^in
other words, to predict scientifically* This is the prophetic and
world-creating power of dream*
It derives
its world-creating
power, not by virtue of being dream—this
is denied by the
phantasies of madmen—^but because it reflects in the sphere of
thought a movement which, with the help of dream, can be
fully realised in practice* It draws its creative power, like the
poetry of the harvest
festival, from
its value as a guide and
spur to action* It is dream already passed out of the sphere of
dream into that of social revolution* It is the dream, not of an
individual, but of a man reflecting in his individual conscious-
ness the creative role of a whole class, whose movement is given
in the material conditions of society*
Again and again we have emphasised the importance of study-
ing poetry as an organic part of society, historically—that is, in
movement*
But
movement
for
its
complete
specification
requires that we state not only/rom where but to where* In our
survey of its past we were already standing in its future—our
present—^but- now, to understand
its present, we must think
ourselves into the future* We can only do this broadly; we can

XII
THE FUTURE OF POETRY
ZJl
only predict a quantitative movement produced by the most
fundamental and elementary forces* Sociology as a real science
is still only in its infancy because science is not mere contem-
plation;
it arises from an active struggle with reality, whose
successive
changes
are
generalised
in
a
scientific
law* The
science of sociology
is
therefore
a product of revolutionary
activity,
for
this
is the activity which changes
social reality*
Man has not yet learned fully to control himself*
This movement will be fought out in our own conscious-
nesses and will be the very force enlarging and transforming
them* Thus a whole new world of values will be born, which
we can no more describe in terms of quality than a man can
look down on himself*
The first limitation must make us careful of any predictions
too
exact and detailed—a small alteration can often make a
quality transform itself into its opposite* The other limitation
should set us on our guard against reducing the novelty of the
future to the stale terms of the present*
The productive forces released by capitalism have developed
to
a
stage where
they
are no
longer
compatible with
the
limitations which engendered them* These limitations are now
being shattered and more or less rapidly transformed* These
changes do not happen
^ ^automatically^^ for history is made by
men^s actions, although their actions by no means always have
the effect they are intended to have* The results of history are
the net product of actions willed by men, but the results of
history are by no means willed by any men*
To-day
all bourgeois culture struggles in the throes of its
final crisis* The contradictions whose tension first drove on the
development of society's productive forces are now wrecking
them and a new system of social relations is already emerging
from the womb of the old—that of communism* Communism
is not an
ideal,
it
is
the inevitable solution of the ripening
contradictions in capitalism* On the one hand the increase of
organisation in the factories; on the other hand the increase of
competition for private profit between the factories* On the
one hand an unparalleled development of productive forces; on
the other hand a system of economy continually generating crises
which result in a restriction of production* On the one hand

zjz
ILLUSION AND REALITY
XII
an increase in international communication, unity of conscious-
ness and interweaving of production; on the other hand an
increasing nationalism and enmity. On the one hand a growing
desire for peace; on the other hand an increasing preparation for
war. Abroad idle capital wildly searching for profit;
at home
idle hands vainly searching for work. At one end of society the
creation of a diminishing number of plutocrats with an income,
power and purchasing capacity increasing beyond the dreams
of earlier
society;
at the other end
the growth of an army
without possessions, without work, without hope to a degree
unknown
to any previous
civilisation. On the one hand an
efflorescence of the sciences and the arts in a new universe of
technique; on the other hand their separation into spheres whose
disintegration and contradiction reduces knowledge
to
chaos
and men to spiritual despair.
These
contradictions
could
be
multiplied
indefinitely,
because they represent at various levels of social organisation
the working-out of the basic bourgeois contradiction—freedom
as the anarchic ignorance of social relations. This ignorance can
only mean freedom
to one
class,
the
class whose
existence
depends on
its continually revolutionising
its own basis and
therefore on its continually preparing the conditions for its own
destruction. The
^'free^^
market—the
blind
lawlessness
by
means of which the laws of anarchy brutally assert themselves
—^has governed the bourgeois mind for four centuries. For four
centuries
it has idealised this one freedom, freedom from
all
social restrictions except that by which the bourgeois class lives
—^restriction of the means of production to itself. This formula
means that freedom must increasingly be elevated to a vague
ideal plane, for to interpret bourgeois freedom materially is to
announce openly
the claim of one
class
to monopolise
the
means of freedom. The social product is the condition of free-
dom, and to monopolise it means monopolising such freedom
as
society has produced.
Stripped
to
its naked
essence
the
bourgeois formula of freedom
is
all too true—/or tie bourgeois
class. So stripped, it exposes its true significance. It shows that
all the bourgeois demands for the equality of human souls, for
the freedom of the individual,
for the realisation of personal
worth,
stop short of the one
issue which could make
these

demands real for the exploited majority* They stop short of
attacking the private property of the few which is the condition
for the annihilation of property for the many* They stop short
of attacking the monopolisation of the surplus social product
by the few which is the condition of the slavery of the many
to necessity. This does not, however, shame the bourgeois into
withdrawing his claims and ceasing altogether
to
talk about
freedom and personal worth* On
the
contrary,
this> under-
standing by the unfree of the essence of his formula forces him
to detach it still further from material reality and lift it com-
pletely into an ideal realm where it blossoms and spreads with-
out
restraint,
forming an
inverted world of
ideal freedom
which is at once a protest against real misery and an expression
of real misery—a wholly bourgeois phantasy,
the religion of
humanism.
It
is
precisely
as
the sum of human freedom
diminishes in society that this phantastic ideal world of liberty
and personal worth reaches its most characteristic development*
A
class
exists whose unfreedom
i§ dependent on bourgeois
private property* Its road to freedom is die destruction of the
bourgeois right and therefore the destruction of the class whose
continued existence depends on that right* This unfree
class
has long been famous as the proletariat* It is not merely the
most suffering class of modern society* This typically bourgeois
conception of it overlooks its most important role* History has
always known a most-suffering class since classes existed* Slaves
in ancient society, serfs and peasants in medieval society, wage-
slaves in modern society, their miseries have been apparently
ineradicable from the conscience of society since the day when
economic production reached a level where a man could pro-
duce more than his means of subsistence and it became profit-
able to exploit other men. ^^The poor ye have always with yoii.^"
Buddha, Christ and Luther accepted the sufferings of the major
part of humanity as part of the necessary lot of life on this
world, and called into being a whole phantastic other world to
redress the balance,
to soothe the suffering and therefore the
revolt of tortured men.i

world, and not in Nirvana or the next world,

But the movement of capitalist economy lays the foundations
of
its
destruction by the way
in which
it
creates
its most

class*
Its
organisation of the
proletariat
into huge
factories
creates
the
conditions
for a shadow, workers* state
behind the bourgeois

the use of the exploited by the
bourgeoisie
in
their
early
struggles
for power
educates
the
proletariat politically; the need of the proletariat to form
its
own organisations to protect itself in its struggle for part of the
surplus value of its labour raises
its
political education to a
higher
plane;
the
improved
communication
and
universal
education necessary for capitalist economy welds it into a com-
pact mass; the bourgeoisie proves its final incompetence to rule
by the onset of permanent crisis in which it is unable to secure
its slaves in the conditions of their slavery, and instead of being
fed by them is forced to feed them, to hurl them into the con-
centration camp or the fighting line* The
rise of permanent
unemployment
is the doom of an epoch;
it foreshadows the
end of the
prehistoric t>r
class
era of society, when men*s
actions made history, but a history quite other than what they
meant to make*
The relentless law of capitalist competition, with
its tend-
ency to a falling rate of interest only offset by actions which
hasten
its own
fall,
accelerates the rise of monopolies which
compete
still more bitterly among themselves, until the con-
tradiction
between
social

the

individual ownership of the factories reaches its height*
The vast majority of the people see themselves faced by a
few who have increasingly monopolised the means of produc-
tion* This
concentration,
so
far from easing the passage
to
socialism, makes* it more painful and disturbed,
because the
increasing irrationality of the privilege on which all capitalist
economy turns forces the bourgeoisie to employ increasingly
brutal, conspiratorial and autocratic methods for its maintenance*

It
costs
the
keenest
of human
pangs
to
produce
a
man,*
and events in Russia, Germany and Spain have only proved the
correctness of the communist warning
that
a
new
society
would be born only in sujSFering, torn by the violence of those
who will do anything to arrest the birth of a world in which the
freedom of the majority
is based on their unfreedom.
This
rebellion of the
suffering people, which has already
taken place in Russia,
is for the majority no clear-headed pas-
sage to a common goal. All classes injured by the final explo-
sion of capitalism—^workers,
peasants,
small
farmers,
shop-
keepers, artisans, technicians, artists, specialists—compose that
rebellious mass:
all are agreed as to the intolerableness of the
situation; but only one class
is organised by its conditions of
life to overthrow the old system and build a new. The other
classes are organised only as part of the system—the capitalist
State—and to overthrow
it
is to dissolve their only means of
organisation.
Only
the
industrial
workers,
via
their
trades
unions,’ co-operatives and political parties, are organised against
that system, and can therefore provide a structure able literally
to overturn society and bring tdie bottom to the top.
This special feature of the industrial working class gives
it
the leadership in the struggle. All odds but its numbers and its
organisation are against it. The bourgeoisie rule the old system
and everywhere monopolise the key points of judiciary, police,
army,
civil service, finance and business. All rnen's minds are
distorted by
bourgeois
presuppositions
through
living
in
a
bourgeois economy. But the pressure of material conditions not
only
drives
on
the
proletariat
to
revolt
as
did
slaves
and
peasants before
it, but unlike them puts the means df success
in
its hands—^its own organisation and the concentration of
capitalism. The organisation of the proletariat, which gives
it
the defacto leadership of revolt in this first period,
is expressed
after
the
success
of this period
in
the
dictatorship of the
proletariat—the most abused and least understood of categories
in the Marxian analysis because it expresses the creative role of
a
class which the bourgeois can sometime regard
as
^^most
suffering"\ but never as "^most advanced"".
The suffering majority are demanding the overthrow of the
old, they do not all see that this means the construction of a

new* Always
it seems to the petty bourgeoisie that one may
roll
history
backwards and
return
to an age when
private
property was not the means of exploitation,
for
tools were
undeveloped enough and scattered enough to be owned by the
man who worked them* Owner and producer were one* The
proletariat knows that the factories cannot be owned individu-
ally like tools* The proletariat does not regret this, but under-
stands that the whole development of capitalist economy, in so
far as it has led to organisation in factories and the socialisation
of labour, has raised the productive forces of society to a level
where the freedom of a few no longer depends on the un-
freedom of the many*
The social product can suffice to provide the freedom of all*
The raising of the level of social productivity which follows on
a proletarian revolution
is the special task of the dictatorship
of the proletariat* In it the other classes learn by practice that
history cannot be turned back; that it is a question of storming
new heights* And, when they understand that, the people as a
whole becomes socialist, and the dictatorship of the proletariat
begins to decay* This is already forecast by the birth of the new
Soviet Constitution, which gives equal rights to all, not as the
climax of communism but as the beginning of a new advance
towards
communism*
Only when communism
comes
into
being will the conception of equal
'Tights*^
pass from
the
fabric of the State, and the State, too, wither away. The very
'Tight'’ of man to realise his freedom by association with others
negates the bourgeois conception of equal right, which was the
highest
ethic
to which
bourgeois
culture
* could
aspire*
Its
average man was
a
reflection of the
equalisation of labour
power in the market. "From each, according to his powers; to
each, according to his needs.” When men's innate ability and
desires vary, how could such a creed—that of communism—^be
compatible
with
equal
rights} A
right
implies
something
exercised against another, and communism is a state of society
in which material conditions no longer force man to be the
enemy of man.
The State came into being to prevent a strife between the
haves and the have-nots, a strife which would have paralysed
society* The
cessation of open
strife
does not remedy
the

XII
THE FUTURE OF POETRY
277
inequality, for this inequality is the condition at this time for
labour reaching a level of increased productivity* The division
between haves« and have-nots
is produced by the division of
labour* The State makes possible the continued existence of
this
inequality, without the shipwreck of society* Since the
interests of haves and have-nots are opposed, it can only main-
tain
this continued existence of inequality by coercion* The
State is the coercive organ whereby the conditions for exploita-
tion by the ruling class are forcibly maintained* As long as men
are sundered by a property right and by the material conditions
of society into
classes of opposed
interests
at secret war,
a
truce can only be maintained by the emergence of a coercive
power apparently above both classes* This power
is the State*
The property of the bourgeois class which secured its freedom
is
the condition of unfreedom for the majority* When
this
majority in turn secures its freedom by expropriating the bour-
geoisie,
the condition of its freedom is the unfreedom of the
bourgeoisie; but whereas the bourgeoisie, like all other ruling
classes, requires an exploited unfree class for its existence, the
proletariat does
not
require
to maintain
the
bourgeoisie
in
order to maintain
its own freedom. Thus the conditions are
prepared for the ending of class-society*
As long as the bourgeoisie and its camp followers exist either
inside
a nation
or
outside
it, *so long must the proletarian
State exist as a coercive organ to maintain the conditions of
freedom for the proletariat. The remnants of bourgeois educa-
tion and the unique experience given them by their privileged
life make
the
expropriated
bourgeoisie
dangerous
enemies,
ready at any time to assert the material basis of their ideal of
freedom by plunging society into violence to regain it* But the
conditions of their
existeifice are not rooted in economy—^the
means of exploitation have been done away with*
State by
State the bourgeoisie withers away, and as it withers the State
too withers, for the State is the expression of a class division
in society, rooted in the material conditions of economy and
affecting the consciousness of men. When all human conscious-
ness is the consciousness of men who have never known bour-
geois conditions of production, then the State no longer needs
to exist as something separate and towering over society* The

278
ILLUSION AND REALITY

seemingly endless war, now secret, now open, but always tragic
and brutal, can cease, for at last^^the misery of a suffering class
has not been diverted against God or the Devil or the Jews or
other members of their own class in other countries or any
other fancied sources of evil, but against the material condi-
tions which produced their suffering as a class* Once rightly
directed against its source, this hate and misery ends* It does
not end peacefully, for the majority jfcd themselves opposed
by the class whose happiness
is rooted in just those conditions
the majority wish to end, and who are therefore prepared to
defend those conditions with violence*
But it is the last fight* The role of the proletarian party in this
tremendous revolution is to be the vanguard of the class whose
objective conditions make it the leader of the whole transition*
To be the vanguard is to lead, not to be swept along; it is also
to remain in touch with the class of which it is the organised
front, to be the active expression of diat classes guiding theory
and shaping will*
How then could the party fulfil this role and not be what it
is in Russia to-day?—in relation to the expropriated
class to
express
the
dictatorship of the
proletariat,
the
final use
of
coercion which
will make
coercion
no
longer
possible;
in
relation to the liberated majority to be the leader, not by any
coercive right but because it jexpresses most clearly and com-
pletely the aims and aspirations of the led* Hence the unique
spectacle of a party which is a minority in the State, and has
no rights or powers as a party, and yet which—^by the tutelage
its members
exert in
all the organs
of contemporary
soviet
society—^guides everywhere
the
activities of the
class whose
experience
it never ceases
to epitomise and express* But the
organisation of the leading members of society as a separate
organisation, however uncoerced,
indicates
a residue of un-
freedom in society due to the still imperfect level of social pro-
duction* Only when it is raised to a plane where all members
of society are able fully
to. realise their physical and mental
individuality can the era of socialism end and that of com-
munism begin* Then the party too will have withered away,
for it will have expanded to a stage where it includes
all, and
therefore will no longer be a party* Only then will men pass

completely from the realm of necessity to that of freedom, not
by
ignoring
necessity but by becoming through action com-
pletely conscious of necessity. In the past man had attained
consciousness of the necessity of the physical environment, but
not of society
itself*
and
so he was
enslaved
to the forms
of society—the machine,
the harvest and
the
relations they
generated. How
could
he
become
fully
conscious
of
the
necessity of society except in the same way as he became con-
scious of the necessity of the environment—^by experience in
changing it? How could political science be anything else but
the science of revolution? Tlius man realises in particulars and
concretely the general and abstract formula of freedom whicfi
is expressed as follows:
Men, in their struggle with Nature (/.^. in their struggle for
freedom) enter into certain relations with each other to win
that freedom, which
consists of the social product resulting
from the change of Nature by men in association for economic
production. But men cannot change Nature without changing
themselves. The full understanding of this mutual interpene-
tration or reflexive movement of men and Nature, mediated by
the necessary and developing relations known as society, is the
recognition of necessity, not only in Nature but in ourselves and
therefore also in society. Viewed objectively this active subject-
object relation
is science, viewed subjectively it is art; but as
consciousness
emerging
in
active union with
practice
it
is
simply concrete living—the whole process of working, feeling,
thinking and behaving like a human individual in one world
of individuals and Nature.
An analysis of the kind we have just completed, an economic
and
political
analysis
of
the^ movement
of society
to-day,
would be *ordinarily regarded as foreign to a study of poetry.
But no one who has patiently followed the argument thus far
can
fail
to
see
its
relevance
to
contemporary
art,
and
the
importance of understanding the revolutionary transformation
of the basis of society which is everywhere affecting art and the
artist.

This
tremendous
revolutionary
transition,
in
which
the
whole superstructure
is
''more or
less rapidly
transformed'',
is
not accomplished
in
the
realm
of ideology by
a simple
instantaneous movement* The transition
is a material one, a
change
of a whole system
of productive
forces and
social
relations, and these material movements are reflected in men's
consciousnesses where all struggles are fought out to an issue*
This transition has only begun, but already its effects are felt
throughout the sphere of art, in all the variety and rich develop-
nlent of the struggle. It is impossible to understand modern art
without some
understanding,
not only of the nature of the
revolution,
but
also of future
society,
the pressure towards
which
is expressed in the trajectory of every flying fragment
from the explosion taking place below the level of consciousness.
We speak of proletarian art; it is an art which expresses the
movement of the proletarian class itself, and this movement is
to annihilate
its exikence as a
class by becoming coincident
with society as a whole. It was the role of class society to gather
at one pole all consciousness and so enrich the development of
science and
art. How then could proletarian
art
exist,
as a
higher form than bourgeois art, before proletarian society had
developed its own distinctive consciousness? And this could only
happen
in any
full measure when
proletarian freedom had
exceeded bourgeois freedom—^for consciousness is the reflection
in ideology of the social product which secures its existence.
Art also
is a productive problem.
Proletarian consciousness, when
it has even equalled bour-
geois consciousness, will be of a higher quality, for the reason
that bourgeois freedom and consciousness was the monopoly of
one class in society and expressed only the aspirations and aims
of that class. Bourgeois art, because of this, is the art of a man,
half of whose organism has been cut away. The bourgeois class
is not a class or a minority in the sense that it is a group of
men more or less taken at random: such men may excellently
express in any sphere a complete and rounded consciousness of
redity—artists
or
scientists
in
any
society
will be
such
a
minority. But the bourgeois
class
is an economic class—^a

defined by a diflFerence in its whole material surroundings and
mode of life;
it is a class, not a self-suflScient society* It there-
fore handles only part of the concrete living of society* The
rest of life's movement goes out into the eternal night of the
other class and returns from
it into the day of consciousness/
transformed—no bourgeois knows how* To know how would
be to cease to be a bourgeois* Hence the final incompleteness of
the bourgeois vision, and as the material contradiction which is
the
cause of the
separation of classes
increases,
so
the gap
between thinking and acting widens*
Social consciousness
is
torn from
social
action
like
flesh from
bone* The
ravages
apparent in modern consciousness show that man can hardly
endure the pangs of this dismemberment*
The consciousness which remains adhering to the pole of the
ruling class contracts and stiffens because it is separated from
its organic nexus* It becomes academic, reactionary and fascist
and petrifies in a living death* The bulk of artistic consciousness
cannot
survive
this
fission* A
part
is
attracted—^by
all
the
blindness and instinct in it—to Ae pole of the exploited class,
but the effect of this is to explode the whole field of conscious-
ness into fragments* This unendurable tension is shown in the
chaotic and intoxicated confusion of all sincere modern bour-
geois
art, decomposing and whirling about in a flux of per-
plexed agony* It is expressed by the cries of the Lawrences and
their
followers,
demanding a
release from
the
torments
of
modern intellectual consciousness; and the schizophrenic vision
of Joyce, condemning the whole Witches' Sabbath of bourgeois
experience*
Pulled to the opposite pole by instinct and dumb experience,
retained there and clarified by the organising force of the prole-
tariat's
life,
part
of
the
bourgeois
artistic
consciousness
separates
out,
adhering
to
the
pole
of
the
exploited
and
revolutionary
class. It fuses there with such consciousness as
has
already formed
dtoring
the
developing
process
of
their
separation: this already formed consciousness is scientific rather
than artistic; intellectual and active rather than emotional and
expressive*
This new consciousness gradually attracts
all the dispersed
elements of the old* The pattern of the old consciousness almost

ILLUSION AND REALITY
XII
282
vanishes* Organised along the 'lines of force'* of the bourgeois
categories, it was necessary that it be wholly broken up before
the old elements could enter into a richer pattern, a pattern
that now becomes the creation, not of a limited part of society
but of a
class which has expanded
to include the whole of
concrete living* This expansion will be evidenced in the fuller
content of the new consciousness, which will now be fed by the
whole process of human reality and can therefore blossom as
organically as a flower, just as it did in tribal society, but with
all the te^nical elaboration evolved since then* Proletarian art
in realising itself will become communist art*
This process is simply a parallel in the sphere of ideology to
what will take place in the sphere of material economy* Here
the elements of bourgeois production,
the productive
forces,
are bursting into anarchy as a result of the repulsive movement
between the poles of the classes, generated by the development
of the categories of bourgeois economy* Only when these are
dissolved can the elements be arranged in die more fruitful
organisation of socialism, but meanwhile the
first clarifying
outline of the forms of socialist economy has already appeared
as an organising power at the proletarian pole, developing from
trade unions to soviets of workers' powers*
All this is fought out in the consciousnesses of men* In the
sphere of art this appears as the fugitive or confused alliances
of bourgeois artists with the proletariat, and the emergence (at
first within the limits of bourgeois technique) of proletarian
artists*
*
The bourgeois artist has thfee possible roles in relation to the
proletariat—opposition,
alliance
or
assimilation*
Opposition
.means a return to discarded categories: it is no longer possible
to
return
to
the
discarded
forms
of yesterday;
they
have
annihilated themselves* It is necessary to "regress" and return
to almost mythological themes, to interpret the world in terms
of the blood and the unconsciousness^ It is necessary to bar-
barise both the ego and the external world in order to find a
sanction for an opposition which can only be an alliance with
the privileged forces of reaction* This attempt to roll history
back gives us Spenglerian, "Aryan" and Fascist art*
Most bourgeois
artists are at present treading the road of

xn
THE FUTURE OF POETRY
283
alliance—Gide in France; Day. Lewis, Auden and Spender in
this country—and many of the surnalistes have signed the same
treaty
Such an alliance can only be an ^^anarchisd"
alliance*
The bourgeois
class cannot generate any higher organisation
than
that which
it has
generated—^the
organisation
of the
nationalist
State,
which
reaches
its
extremest form
in
the
Fascist State.
If, therefore, any artists reject this organisation
and become revolutionary, they can only be organised in the
higher forms created by the proletariat. But this is the road of
assimilation, and we are discussing now bourgeois artists who
enter
into an
alliance, which means they do not enter
the
proletarian organisation but remain outside the ranks as
' ‘fellow
travellers*h Their attitude to existing society therefore can only
be
destructive—^it
is
anarchist,
nihilist and
surrealiste. They
often glorify the revolution as a kind of giant explosion which
will blow up everything they feel to be hampering them. But
they have no constructive theory— mean as artists: they may
as economists accept the economic categories of socialism, but
as artists they cannot see the new forms and contents of an art
which will replace bourgeois art.
They know “something is to come** after this giant firework
display of the Revolution, but they do not feel with the clarity
of an artist the specific beauty of this new concrete living, for
they are by definition cut off from the organisation which is to
realise
it, and which therefore alone holds in its bosom the
nascent outlines of the future. They must put “something**
there
in
the
future, and they tend
to put their own vague
aspirations for bourgeois freedom and bourgeois equality. They
attempt
to
visualise the brave new world in terms of their
desires: this is in appearance not so different from the Fascist
haters of communism, who attempt to hold back the new
world to the measure of thir desires. In both cases a sketch of
the
future
is produced which
is
curiously pathological and
spiritually hysterical; but in the one case it is evolving back-
wards, in the other case
it
is full of forward movement and
blind presage.
Of course this anarchic position of the contemporary bour-
geois
artist
is only a variant of the old tragedy of bourgeois
revolt. At each stage the bourgeois revolts against the system

ILLUSION AND REALITY
XII
284
by the assertion of contradictory categories which only hasten
on the advance of the things he hates* But it is a nev) variant
of the tragedy* Actively to help on the development of bour-
geois economy at this final stage is to help on its destruction;
hence these allies of the proletariat are genuine revolutionaries
and the destructive element in their activity
is^ not fake,
it
is
real and complete* Their cleavage arises from the impossibility
of a constructive approach to the Revolution*
This Trotsky-like element in their orientation expresses itself
in many ways* The younger are Romantic Revolutionaries: it is
the wild and destructive part of revolution that seems to them
most picturesque: and in many cases it is evident that a revolu-
tion
without
violence
would
be
disappointing*
Baudelaire
expressed
this
revolutionary
spirit
which
is
anarchic
in an
extreme form when he said,
referring to his
fighting at the
barricades in 1848: ‘*Moi, quand je consens k ^tre r^publicain,
je fais le mal le sachant
*
*
* je dis: Vive la Revolution! comme
.
je dirais: Vive la Destruction! Vive la Mortf^
It gives even the revolutionary element in their art a Fascist
tinge, because they draw their hate at the same source, petty
bourgeois suflFeringffom bourgeois development* However, with
them this hate
is directed against its true source,
capitalism,
whereas with Fascists it is directed against mythical sources
Marxists, Jews, and other nations* (The destructive element in
genuinely
proletarian
art
arises
from
proletarian
suflFering,
which is a different kind of misery,)
On the constructive side the affective context of their work
is often vague, disorientated and confused:
it always copiceals
in some form or other a demand for '^freedom
for me^^
or
^'freedom from social restraints^'* There
is a slightly anxious
preoccupation with personal
liberties and a scurrying hither
and thither for reassurances or corrections in the proletarian
revolutionary theory because of its suspicious deviations from
petty bourgeois limitations and ideals*
This
is
a, source of confusion in their art, which too often
reduces
it
to
chaos,
or may even
silence them*
It must be
understood that this ^frefusd" to be assimilated in the prole-
tarian organisation does not
necessarily mean that they stand
completely outside
the
proletarian
revolutionary
ranks. The

proletarian revolution takes place under the hegemony of the
proletariat; and
this means that these
artists must accept to
some degree
the marching
orders of the proletarian general
staff
unless
they
are
to condemn
themselves
to
complete
nullity in action, which few of them now do* They must work
with the proletariat somehow, and this necessarily involves their
accepting the obligations of united action* This
is educative
and has had, for example, a considerable effect on Spender and
Day Lewis* In some cases it may even extend to their joining
the party of the proletariat—^the Communist Party—but the
extreme reluctance of most of these artists to take this step is
symptomatic* None the less, even if they join the party, this
anarchist quality in their alliance takes a characteristic form*
They announce
themselves
as prepared
to merge with
the
proletariat, to accept its theory and its organisation, in every
field of concrete living except that of art* Now this reservation
—^unimportant to an ordinary man—is absolutely disastrous for
an artist, precisely because his most important function is to
be an artist* It leads to a gradual separation between his living
and his art—his living as a proletarian diverging increasingly
from his art as a bourgeois* All his proletarian aspirations gather
at one pole,
all his bourgeois art at the other* Of course this
separation cannot take place without a mutual distortion* His
proletarian living bursts into his art in the form of crude and
grotesque scraps of Marxist phraseology and the medbanical
application of the living proletarian theory—^this is very clearly
seen in the three English poets most closely associated with the
revolutionary movement* His
bourgeois
art
bursts
into
his
proletarian living in the form of extraordinary and quite un-
necessary
outburts of bourgeois
'^independence'' and
indis-
cipline or quite apparent bourgeois distortions of the party's
revolutionary theory* It leads to an unconscious dishonesty in
his art—as of a man exploiting the revolution for his own ends*
This is due to the fact that he sees the revolution as a path to
a bourgeois heaven and is‘aware that his fellow revolutionaries
have different ideas* However, he is prepared to co-operate for
the sake of overthrowing the present system* This is only dis-
honest because it is unconscious—^if open,
it would be a fair
working
alliance,
an
acknowledged
treaty
like
that which

the

of

People's
Front.
Since the reservation extends chiefly to the field of art, this
artist's main preoccupation with the revolution
is
to secure
guarantees of his freedom in the field of art after the revolution.
He
is not at all concerned about what would to most people
seem more
important—^his
freedom
in
concrete
living. He
understands that his other activities will be freer then, because
in these other matters he already has a proletarian point of
view. He is concerned as to whedier art will be free, whether
there will be a
"'censorship" on
artt
All
his
conceptions of
freedom are in fact summed up in one word—"censorship".
He goes to Russia not so much to see if the people are free,
but if the artists are "interfered with" by the authorities. And
this leads him to a typically bourgeois conception of the artist
as a man whose r61e
is to be a lone wolf, a man who realises
beauty for society only because he is exempt from contemporary
social restraints; and he attempts to patchwork this conception
into proletarian theory.
Of course this
is not peculiar to the
artist.
Scientists,
for
example, will make an alliance with the proletariat in the same
way; they make reservations only in the field of* science. They
go
to
Russia
prepared
to
"sacrifice"
everything,
provided
scientific theory is not interfered with. They develop a typically
bourgeois conception of the scientist as a "lone wolf". And
this
extends
to
everyone—teachers,
peasants,
administrators,
historians,
actors,
economists,
soldiers and factory managers
who see the necessity of an alliance with the proletariat, freely
and consciously choose
it, and are prepared to accept prole-
tarian leadership in every field except the one which is valuable
to them, and where they demand the retention of bourgeois
categories. The fact that if all these different petty bourgeois
claims
were
granted
they
would,
when lumped
together,
negate any proletarian
society
at
all, and simply
equal
the
retention of the present system against which they revolt, does
not of course affect the individu^s who make the demand, for
they have carefully segregated their particular fields of interest
from the field of life as a whole, and the artist is, for example,
quite content to see the scientist proletarianised. It
is for this

XII
THE FUTURE OF POETRY
287
very reason .that the more the petty bourgeois becomes revolu-
tionary, the less he can operate in his own organisations with
other bourgeois revolutionaries, and the more he becomes an
individual under the hegemony of the proletariate
This dichotomy between life and the most valued function
is only possible because the development of bourgeois culture
has produced a flying apart of all ideology into separate spheres
of
art,
philosophy,
physics,
psychology,
history,
biology,
economics, music, anthropology and the like which,
as they
increase their internal organisation and achievement, mutually
repel each other and increase the general confusion* This
is
m'erely an equivalent in the
field of thought of the way in
which organisation within the factory has increased disorganisa-
tion between the factory; it is the struggle of productive forces
with productive relations;
it
is
the
quarrel of real elements
with bourgeois categories; it is part of the basic contradiction
of capitalism* The task of the proletariat is just as much to
integrate this ideological confusion and raise it to a new level
of consciousness, as
it is to integrate the economic confusion
and
raise
it
to ’a new
level of production* One task
is the
counterpart of the other, and both have a common aim—^to
win more freedom for humanity*
To all these bourgeois revolutionaries the conscious proletariat
therefore addresses the same kind of words:
?Your conception of freedom, because it is rooted in a part
of society,
is dso
partial* All consciousness is determined by
the society which produces it, but because you are ignorant of
this mode of determination, you imagine your consciousness to
be free and not determined by your experience and history*
This
illusion you
exhibit
so proudly
is
the badge of your
slavery to yesterday, for if you could see those causes which
determine your thought, you would be like us, on the road to
freedom* The recognition of necessity in society
is the only
passage to social freedom*
^^But when we say that consciousness is determined by the
society which produces
it, we say that thought
is ultimately
inseparable from concrete living, from practice. Each secures
and develops
the freedom of the
other* You think that by
separating theory from practice—and from the social obligations

288
ILLUSION AND REALITY
XII
and forms that go with practice—^y-ou are making thought free
from 'censorship'. You hope to segregate thought from life, and
so, by surrendering everything but this, in some way preserve
a part of man's freedom, like the man who wrapped his talent
in a napkin rather than adventure it in the market. However,
freedom
is not a substance to be preserved and isolated but a
force generated in an active struggle with the concrete problems
of
living. You would
deliver
thought
to
the
bondage
of
unconscious bourgeois
categories; you would rob
practice of
its soul.
"There
is no neutral world of art,
free from
categories or
determining
causes.
Art
is
a
social
activity.
Yours
is
the
fallacious freedom of dream, which imagines itself spontaneous
when it is rigidly determined by forces outside consciousness.
You must choose between class art which is unconscious of its
causality and is therefore to that extent false and unfree, and
proletarian art which is becoming conscious of its causality and
will therefore emerge as the truly free art ofcommunism. There
is no
classless art except communist
art, and that
is not yet
born; and class art to-day, unless it is proletarian, can only be
the art of a dying cla^s.
"We shall not cease to criticise the bourgeois content of your
art. You indignantly
reject
these
'economic'
categories,
not
because they are incorrect but because they are economic. But
what are
correct economic categories except categories drawn
from concrete living? Ours is simply a demand that you should
square life with art and art with life, that you should make art
living. Cannot you see that their separation is precisely what
is evil and bourgeois? Cannot you see that in this one matter
you line up with our enemies—^yoti, our ally—^which is why on
this point we fight your theory so bitterly?
"C5ur demand—that your art should be proletarian—^is not a
demand
that
you
apply
dogmatic
categories
and
Marxist
phrases to art. To do so would be bourgeois. We ask that you
should
really live in the new world and not leave your soul
behind in die past. It is your artist's soul for which we value
you; and how can your soul be in the new world if your art is
bourgeois? We
shall know
that
this
transition
has
taken
place when
your
art
has
become
living;
then
it
will
be

XII
THE FUTURE OF POETRY
289
proletarian*
Then we
shall
cease
to
criticise
it
for
its
deadness*
Ours is not a demand that you should accept in the realm
of art what you call proletarian dictatorship* On the contrary,
we shall say you are
still bourgeois as long as you impose a
proletarian dictatorship on yourself and import formulations
from
other
fields
of
proletarian
ideology
to
apply
them
mechanically to art* It is a demand that you, an artist, become
a proletarian
leader in the
field of art,* that you do not take
eidier of these
easy roads which
are
in essence the same
mechanically shufiling the outworn categories of bourgeois art
or mechanically importing the categories of other proletarian
spheres* You must take
the
difficult
creative road—that of
refashioning
the
categories and technique of art
so
that
it
expresses the new world coming into being and
is part of its
redisation* Then we shall say your art is proletarian and living;
then we shall say, your soul has left the past—it has dragged
the past into the present and forced the realisation of the future.
You
are not now
'just an
artist'
(which means
in
fact
a
bourgeois artist); you have become a proletarian artist*"
The
proletariat
addresses what
is
in
substance
the same
message to the scientist, the engineer, the factory manager, the
historian and the econonoist* But in each case the message
is
not understood; it is regarded as formal or even insincere. The
debate cannot be solved in theory, for the essence of this dis-
pute is that the antagonists live in two worlds—one of bour-
geois categories and ^ other of proletarian* It can, however,
be solved in the world of practice, for both are living in the
same real world* Hence the progress of the socialist revolution
hastens
the
assimilation
of
its
bourgeois
allies*
Still,
the
bourgeois
consciousness
drags
at the bourgeois revolutionary
and produces in certain characters a hopeless deavage, which
makes the degeneration of some of its leaders a law of revolu-
tion*
The
record
of Trotsky,
Zinoviev
and Kamenev
are
examples of how this may lead to complete treachery. On the
other hand it may act as a ''drag" to hold back the artist from
full ripening* The lives and work of Yessenin, Mayakovsky,
Pilnyak and Yury Olesha are examples of the conflict involved
in this inability to recast creatively the categories of bourgeois
T

290
ILLUSION AND REALITY
XII
art after the Revolution, Meanwhile, at the proletarian pole,
the whole process of assimilation
is hastened by the develop-
ment of the socialist revolution.
On the one hand men with proletarian lives attempt to inter-
pret these in terms of existing bourgeois
categories,
that
is,
they
use
the
already
existing
bourgeois
artistic
technique.
Necessarily marked
at
first by an uncertainty,
a poverty in
handling
alien
categories,
this attempt gives
rise
to what
is
sometimes
regarded
as
being
essentially
proletarian
art,
although
it
is really an art in transition. This art has a sim-
plicity and openness of theme which goes with a certain crudity
and clumsiness in handling the technique; rather like a prole-
tarian occupying for the
first time
a role in administration
which hitherto had been peculiarly the prerogative of the bour-
geois, Yet
it
is by this means that bourgeois technique and
bourgeois administration will be
lifted to a new
level by a
laborious refashioning, in which at first every mistake is made
except the fatal bourgeois mistakes.
On the other hand
artists with bourgeois
consciousnesses
attempt to refashion these in order to express proletarian life.
These meet the others, as it were, tunnelling from the opposite
side. One group attempts to push proletarian living (practice)
into
bourgeois
consciousness
(theory);
the
other
to
push
bourgeois
consciousness
into
proletarian
living.
Both
tasks
demand a complete refashioning of consciousness and neither
can be
successful
alone. The
bourgeois attempt produces
a
characteristic
art which
is
also sometimes regarded as
really
proletarian art instead of being bourgeois art in transition, an
art in which the rich but vague, fumbling and disorganised
elements
in
bourgeois
art
are
imperfectly transformed
into
large, concrete, proletarian realities.
Great proletarian art can only arise from a synthesis of the
two, from the complete assimilation after breakdown of the old
consciousness by the proletariat, which assimilation raises that
consciousness
to
a new
level,
the
level
of communist
con-
sciousness.
Because then the proletariat has become coincident with the
whole of society,
this consciousness
is no longer partial and
torn
apart from
life,
like
flesh from bone.
Society and
its

29I
reflection in man is no longer rent and wounded* Art returns

3
Poetty
expresses
in
a
generalised
and
abstract way
the
dynamic relation of the ego to the elements of outer reality
symbolised by words* This very generalisation is the source of
its ability to voice with unique power the instinctive emotional
element in man—the physiological component of the
social
ego-
Poetry
begins, we
recall,
as the
cries of primitive hunters
and food-gatherers in which man attempts to master Nature
by changing himself—^by throwing himself into Nature
so
that
his way
of associated
life
conforms with
the
desired
objects, just as his social perception expressed in art strives to
conform with the track of the beasts,
its special outline,
its
specific ferocity and vulnerability. This introjection of the self
into Nature is conscious because it is social; man could only
hunt and gather food successfully in co-operation even at this
early stage. This is the poetry which summons from the breast
of man a mimicry of Nature that is nor a mere reflection, but
a Nature as man desires her woven from the strands of Nature
as men share her in common effort. There is a tense bareness
about the art of this stage.
This passes into the poem as myth and ritual,
as chorus or
chant, where Nature in the shape of herds and crops is taken
into
the
heart
of
society. Men,
instead
of changing
their
associated perception and action to conform with the outline of
Nature, change Nature^s outline to conform with their own.
The world
process
is
extravagantly
distorted
to
suit man^s
whim. Yet the society into which Nature has been dragged is
still
undifferentiated and
collective.
Society
is
passive
yet
creative, like a pregnant woman. It has a certain closed compla-
cency. Life is now in it—^not outside.
In the next stage the introjection of Nature into society has
led to society itself splitting into antagonistic parts or classes.
Division of labour
is reflected in a division of society. The
development of agricultural and pastoral
civilisation leads to

292
ILLUSION AND REALITY
XII
the creation of a ruling class which becomes ossified and has
as its counterpart a class of serfs and slaves* The struggle with
Nature
is transformed into men's
struggle with each other*
The
first emergence of the ruling
class
is seen as the trans-
formation of mythology into the epic^ and into story, and in
the evolution of ritual into
play* The
conflict of society
is
reflected in a poetry sombre and clouded with moral issues
questions of right and wrong—balanced by a poetry concerned
with
delight—^with
love and
joy*
Doubt,
pathos,
nobility,
serenity,
fear and a
conscious beauty
all
enter
the
field of
poetry* And the development of classes, by rendering possible
the differentiation of function,
gives more freedom to indi-
viduality* For the
first time men speak personally in poetry*
The lyric is born*
The bourgeois class comes to rule—a class the conditions of
whose existence is the continual revolution of its basis* Poetry
becomes
dizzy,
tragic,
full
of contradictions*
Its
technique
undergoes the most rapid transformations* Its law of formation
decrees that each step it takes in revolt against the conditions
of its existence only urge on the ripening of those conditions
and
its own
fall* The continual revolt of poets
against the
negation of poetry and individual freedom by concrete bour-
geois existence only calls into being a whole world of poetry
precisely fulfilling the conditions of concrete bourgeois exist-
ence*
It flies away from life into a heaven of pure art, whose
assertion of personal worth and open denial of concrete living
increase
in proportion
to
the
rate
at which concrete living
strangles the realisation of personal worth* This withdrawal in
itself reflects the movement of the bourgeois class from reality,
the development of the contradiction between bourgeois con-
sciousness
and
proletarian
reality,
between
the
productive
forces of society and the social conditions of existence of the
capitalist class*
Poetry reaches technically an unprecedented competence;
it
draws more and more apart from the world of reality; it asserts
with inaeasing success the personal perception of life and the
personal feeling until
it becomes so desocialised that at
first
perception and then feeling cease to exist at all* The great mass
of men no longer read poetry, no longer feel the need for
it,

XII
THE FUTURE OF POETRY
293
no longer understand it, because poetry has moved away from
concrete living by the development of its technique, and this
movement was itself only the counterpart of a similar move-
ment in the whole of society*
Thus the poet was forced by life
Le. by his experience—to
concentrate on just those words and organising values which
were becoming steadily
less meaningful to men as a whole,
until poetry, from a necessary function of all society (as in a
primitive tribe), becomes the luxury of a few chosen spirits*
The movement
forward from
bourgeois
culture
to com-
munism
is
also a movement back to the social solidarity of
primitive communism, but one which includes and gathers up
all the development of the interim,
all the division of labour
which has made possible an increase in freedom, individuation
and consciousness. It is a movement back to the collectivism
and integrity of a society without coercion, where consciousness
and freedom are equally shared by all.
Such a society primitively was a society which, because of its
low productivity, had an integrity that was crude and bare, and
a sum of consciousness and freedom so scanty that although
shared by all each share was small. It was necessary for freedom
and consciousness to be monopolised, to gather for a time at
the pole of a ruling class, for man to develop all the productive
powers that slumbered in the lap of social labour. And when
this gives rise to a contradiction which can only be solved by
communism, the productive powers based on division and organ-
isation of labour have developed to a stage where individual
differentiation can take place freely within the integrity of one
society, where freedom and consciousness are sufficient for all
to share and yet be rich in liberty; a society where freedom and
consciousness, because
it
is general,
is higher than in a class
society, where it is perpetually maimed and torn. Individuality
reaches a new and higher realisation.
This means a great expansion in the poet^s public. As freedom
and consciousness become the right of all and not the preroga-
tive
of
a
class,
the
poet's
public must become
gradually
coincident with society, and poetry once more fulffl a function
similar to that of poetry in the primitive tribe, but with this
difference—that
the
tremendous
growth
of
the
productive

ILLUSION AND REALITY
XII
294
forces has differentiated poetry from the other
arts,
the
arts
from the sciences, and changed poetry itself from the poetry
of a tribe to the poetry of individual men* By becoming collec-
tive, therefore, poetry in the era of communism will not become
less individual but more so* This individuation will be artistic
—carried out by the change of the social ego, not personal and
dream-like—carried out by the reduction of the social ego to
unconsciousness*
The increase of the poet's public can already be seen in the
Soviet Union where poets have publics of two or three million,
books of poetry have sales of a size unknown previously in the
history of the world*
The
same
change
is
reflected
in
the
poet's
vocabulary*
The
vocabulary of the
bourgeois
poet became
esoteric and
limited*
It was
not
limited
in
the
sense
of limitation
of
number of words but limitation of useable public values of
words* In fact the number and type of words useable by the
bourgeois poet increased,
paralleling the continual revolution
in technique which, because
it
is the condition of capitalist
existence, continues right down to the end of capitalism* But
this increase and enrichment in technique
is paralleled by a
decrease and
impoverishment
of
the
social
associations
in
words which can be used by the poet*
One after another these associations became vulgar, common,
conventional, insincere,
trite, jaded or commercialised because
the life from which they sucked their souls was becoming these
things* Hence modem poetry grows barer and barer of life, of
real social content, and the only word-values useable by poetry
become increasingly personal until poetry is altogether esoteric
and private* It was for this reason that poetry became no longer
acceptable
to most people,
submerged in the
conditions of
bourgeois civilisation* It was too rebellious, too openly critical
of concrete
living*
It was
rebellious,
not revolutionary,
but
neither was
it opiate*
It did not take their vulgarised values
and outraged instincts and soothe both in an ideal wi^h-ful-
filment world like that of religion, jazz or the detective novel*
It quietly excluded all those vulgarised values, but in doing so,
it step by step excluded more and more of concrete living, and
it was this process that called into being the world of art for

XII
THE FUTURE OF POETRY
295
art's
sake, of otherness and illusion, the towering heaven of
dream which ultimate^ became completely private and turned
into an abyss of nightmare and submarine twilight*
Thus poetry lost that simplicity of outline,
that grandeur
and searching nobility which comes to
it from being sited in
the heart of concrete living and able to voice the most general
and important experiences in the most universally meaningful
way*
Though rebellious, poetry was not revolutionary, for revolu-
tion remains within the sphere of material reality and operates
with the common values and outraged instincts of men* It does
not organise them to soothe them in a phantastic heaven, but
bends their hate and aspirations, however limited, to the task
of wiping out the real cause of their misery here in the world
of concrete
life* The poet cannot be the leader of revolution
(although at a certain stage he can be its singer and inspirer),
because his world has become by the pressure of alien values too
small a part of the real world and it is part of the task of the
revolution to widen it*
The change of values, the de-vulgarisation of life, the growth
of collective freedom and the release of individual consciousness
which takes place in communism^ means the return of these
social values, regenerated and ennobled, to the palette of the
artist* His
vocabulary may at
first be even simplified
as to
number
of
words,
precisely
because
the
world
of
reality
released by those words for poetry is complicated and enriched*
Now he can speak in the old noble way* The world of values
behind language will expand for poetry in the same way as it
did during the Elizaberihan era—then by the revelation of a
whole world of values, before personal to the poet but for the
first time made social; now by the injection into poetry of a
whole world of purified social values for the
first time made
personal to the poet* This change in the technique of poetry is
a reflection of the way art returns into the life from which it
has flown away, bringing back with
it
all the development
produced by the cleavage*
The
individuality
developed by bourgeois economy, which
became anarchic and stifled itself, is still further elaborated by
the categories of communism, and at the same time integrated,

ILLUSION AND REALITY
XII
296
given a collective wholeness and sanity. This
is
likely to be
expressed in two ways. On the one hand the development of
broadcasting will give to poetry a new collective appearance, on
the other hand the individuality of the actor will no longer
conflict with the poetic instant, and poetry can return to drama
making it once more collective and real. It seems also (though
this
is bare conjecture) that the
film, because
it realises the
highest possibilities of the bourgeois stage in a more collective,
more richly powerful and more flexible form, will only come
into its own in communism.
As
conductor
is to
orchestra,
so producer
is
to
film,
the
incarnation of the ego in which the story takes place, but his
power is far greater than that of the conductor. It must not be
supposed that communism involves the stifling of actor,
or author. On the contrary,
it
is just then that their indivi-
duality will be given a more
elaborate and deeper meaning
because it will be a collective meaning. It is no accident that
the final period of bourgeois culture, which raised individuality
to its height, produc;ed no ^^heroes'^ no great authors,
artists,
actors or poets. The great man is not just an individuality but
an individuality given a collective embodiment and significance.
The shadow
is so enormous because it is cast over the whole
of society. Bourgeois culture mocked the proletariat because it
had in
its
first struggles produced Marx,
Lenin and
Stalin,
while according to bourgeois culture communism
^*does not
believe in great men'* or
^'in the individual" and so had here
contradicted
its own
teaching.
In
this mockery
bourgeois
culture only exposes the fallacies in its own conception of the
relation of the individual to society.
It will be seen that the
final movement of society has this
parallel to primitive communism, that dnce again man turns
outward from the ego to reality, and looks the world steadily in
the face. But now the world is not the world of a few beasts and
crops and a wandering sun, but a world enriched by the taking
in of Nature into society during the period of class formation.
It
is a reality elaborated by centuries of interpenetration of
Nature and man, evident in the division of labour in society,
and due to
the attempts of man
to change Nature, at first
solely by drawing her into himself without regard to the whole

XII
THE FUTURE OF POETRY
297
world of social relations
this movement necessarily produces*
When
this period
is ended men can look steadily at
this
whole world of social relations with all its richness and com-
plex values* Before it was only known to them by distortions
in their cognised world,
as secret presences or forces or gods,
as a mere abstraction—^man, the ^^human essence^*, civil society*
This concrete world of life which gathers up within itself as a
rounded, developing whole the divorced and simpler abstract
worlds of man and Nature, is the peculiar concern of the com-
munist poet* He is interested in his own individuality, not in
and for itself—a conception which conceals the contradiction
that wrecked bourgeois society—but in its developing relation
with other individualities in a communicating world that
is
not iust a fluid amorphous
sea, but has
its own rigidity and
reality* The communist poet
is concerned to a degree never
known before with the realisation of all the values contained
in the relations of human beings in real life*
Every phase of art,
every stage of culture, has
its moving
principle which is the source of its tragedy, its beauty, its satis-
faction and its creative power* To primitive culture, the tragedy
of the strong and savage beast; to pastoral society, the tragedy
of gods and myth; to all class society, the tragedy of the will of
the hero* To
early bourgeois
society, the tragedy of the will
of the prince; to
late
bourgeois
society,
the tragedy of the
will of Joyce's ‘^Ulysses" and Proust's ‘1" living in a world
wholly of personal phantasy* Tragedy is not in itself tragic; it
is beautiful,
tender and satisfying—^in the
Aristotelian sense
cathartic* But there
is also the spectacle of culture tragically
perishing because its matrix, society, has become dispersed and
sterile*
This
is
the
pathos
of
art,
which
cannot be
tragic
because it cannot resolve
its problems in a tragic way, but is
torn by insoluble conflicts and perplexed by all kinds of unreal
phantasies* This is the tragedy of art to-day in all its dissolution
and futility* It is the tragedy of will that does not understand
itself; of the unconscious individual who is slave to he knows
not what* Art is the privilege of the free*
All art is conditioned by the conception of freedom which
rules in the society that produces it; art is a mode of freedom,
and a class society conceives freedom to be absolutely whatever

298

relative freedom
that
class has attained
to* In bourgeois art
man is conscious of the necessity of outer reality but not of his
own, because he
is unconscious of the society that makes him
what he is. He is only a half-man. Communist poetry will be
complete, because it will be man conscious of his own necessity
as well as that of outer reality.
That everything which comes
into being must pass away;
that all is fleeting, all is moving; that to exist is to be like the
fountain and have a shape because one
is never
still—is the
theme of all art because
it
is the texture of reality. Man
is
drawn to
life because
it moves from him; he has desires as
ancient and punctual as the stars; love has a poignant sweetness
and the young life pushes aside the old; these are qualities of
being as enduring as man. Man too must pass away.
Therefore
the
stuff of art
endures
as
long
as man. The
fountain dwindles away only when men are rent and wasted by
a
sterile
conflict,
and
the
pulsing movement
of society
is
halted. All this movement is creative because it is not a simple
oscillation but a development unfolded by its very restlessness.
The
eternal
simplicities generate
the enrichment of art from
their own bosoms not only because they are eternal but also
because change is the condition of their existence. Thus art is
one of the conditions of man's realisation of himself, and in its
turn is one of the realities of man.
