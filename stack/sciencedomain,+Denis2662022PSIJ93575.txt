ABSTRACT 
 
After having explored some basic theoretical concepts about the quantum information approach, 
we focus on Entropic Information Theory which is an informational approach mathematically based 
on the mass of the bit of information;         
        
  
. The mass of the bit of information and the 
new entropy formulae associated to it,     
       
 
, and its alternative writings lead to new 
formulation,       
            
      
, to calculate the entropy of black holes independently of the law of 
area. Being able to express the fine-grained gravitational entropy of a black hole using the rules of 
gravity, we can, at this level, speak of quantum gravity as emerging through the fundamentality of 
entangled quantum information by considering that information emerges from degree of freedom; 
indeed, information being a quantum state change due to the modification of one degree of 
freedom from the considered quantum system. In addition, we calculated the informational content 
of the observable universe using the entropic information formula, to obtain,           bits, a result 
remarkably close to some previous estimates to account for all the dark matter missing in the 
visible Universe. After that, we calculated the amount of energy associated with this informational 
content using Landauer's principle, to obtain, 3         Joules, a result that we can relate to dark 
energy estimates. Moreover, some deep considerations based on the perspectives of Entropic 
Information Theory have been explored. This new complete mathematical framework of Entropic 
Information Theory can explain various processes being several aspects of the same, entangled 
information, by considering that information emerges from degree of freedom, it is the theoretical 
framework of the entangled informational universe.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
To begin with, we will examine some of the 
fundamental definitions and claims regarding the 
quantum information approach and explain them 
using The Entropic Information Theory to shed 
new light on these basic concepts. Indeed, after 
defining the notion of quantum information, 
entanglement and non-locality as well as the 
consideration of the measurement problem in the 
context of the generalization of the entropic 
information approach, we can see that this 
approach makes it possible to open new 
perspectives, indeed it provides new formulations 
of 
entropy 
from 
the 
theory 
of 
entropic 
information, as well as a new formulation of the 
entropy of black holes. In addition, a new formula 
for calculating the number of bits of the entire 
current observable universe and a formula about 
the energy currently associated with it have been 
used, leading to important new considerations on 
entropy, quantum gravity, dark matter or dark 
energy, 
respectively, 
presenting 
a 
global 
explanatory mathematical framework of the life 
and the universe. 
 
1.1 Definition of the Information Notion 
within 
the 
Entropic 
Information 
Theory Framework 
 
Some attempts to define the concept of 
information have been attempted, for example, 
Lucien Hardy's attempt at the informational 
properties of a system, where "the informational 
properties of a system should depend only on the 
number of distinct messages that can be 
encoded on that system" [1], can be related to 
the notion of a bit of information, which, in 
information theory, is the minimum amount of 
information conveyed by a message. But we can 
say about quantum information which is the basic 
entity of study in quantum information theory, 
and which can be manipulated using quantum 
information processing techniques; that following 
John 
Preskill's 
approach 
that 
quantum 
information is information about the state of a 
quantum system, that information is something 
physical that is encoded in the state of a 
quantum system [2]. Indeed, Gleason's theorem 
says that “a quantum state is completely 
determined by knowing only the answers to all 
possible yes/no questions”, a yes/no question is 
presumably a self-adjoint operator with two 
distinct eigenvalues. But information can only 
exist in a region that also contains energy. In 
addition, this energy has properties by which we 
can describe it. It has degrees of freedom. These 
degrees of freedom can be considered the 
minimum number of coordinates required to 
specify a configuration. “Each spin can be taken 
to represent a bit, and each spin flip corresponds 
to a bit flip. Almost any interaction between 
degrees of freedom is sufficient to perform 
universal quantum logic on these degrees of 
freedom” [3,4]. This leads Entropic Information 
Theory to define the notion of information in a 
more precise and relevant way; indeed, it can be 
said 
by 
following 
the 
theory 
of 
entropic 
information that information is a quantum state 
change due to the modification of a degree of 
freedom in the quantum system considered.  
 
1.2 Definition of the Entanglement Notion 
within 
the 
Entropic 
Information 
Theory Framework 
 
In quantum physics, certain states, called 
entangled 
states, 
show 
certain 
statistical 
correlations between measurements on particles 
that cannot be explained by classical theory. An 
entangled system is defined as a system whose 
quantum state cannot be factored as a product of 
the states of its local constituents. That is, they 
are not individual particles but an inseparable 
whole. In quantum entanglement, one constituent 
cannot be described in detail without taking into 
account the other or others. The entanglement 
process is carried out when two particles are 
linked together, regardless of the separation from 
one to the other. In quantum mechanics, even if 
these entangled particles are not physically 
connected; they are always able to instantly 
share information. In other words, in quantum 
mechanics, entanglement occurs when one or 
more properties of two particles or molecules 
such as spin, polarization, or momentum are 
shared at the quantum level; this connection 
persists even if the particles move away from 
each other. 
 
Quantum information can be measured using 
Von Neumann’s entropy. Indeed, entropy is 
considered a measure of entanglement. Entropy 
provides a tool that can be used to quantify 
entanglement. The entropy of a mixed state can 
be thought of as a measure of quantum 
entanglement. Von Neumann entropy is a 
measure of the statistical uncertainty represented

by a quantum state. Von Neumann entropy 
connects to all other forms of entropy and 
glimpses the real origin of the second law of 
thermodynamics. The growth of entanglement 
leads to both the second law of thermodynamics 
and the emergence of the classical world from 
quantum. In addition, it also defines the arrow of 
time that itself points in the direction of increasing 
entropy and multiplying entanglement. 
 
Following the theory of entropic information and 
its definition of information as a quantum state 
change due to the modification of a degree of 
freedom 
in 
the 
quantum 
system 
under 
consideration; quantum entanglement can be 
defined as the physical phenomenon that occurs 
when a group of particles is generated, interacts 
or shares spatial proximity such that one or more 
degrees of freedom are shared at the quantum 
level between each particle in the group; a 
particle that cannot be described independently 
of the quantum state of others because they 
share degrees of freedom, even when the 
particles are separated by a great distance. 
 
1.3 Definition of the Nonlocality within the 
Entropic 
Information 
Theory 
Framework 
 
Quantum nonlocality is sometimes understood as 
being equivalent to entanglement. However, this 
is not the case. Quantum entanglement can be 
defined only within the formalism of quantum 
mechanics, i.e., it is a model-dependent property. 
In contrast, nonlocality refers to the impossibility 
of a description of observed statistics in terms of 
a local 
hidden 
variable model, so it is 
independent of the physical model used to 
describe the experiment. Non-locality means that 
measuring the properties of a quantum particle in 
one location can instantaneously affect the 
properties of another, even if the two particles 
are in different locations. A local hidden variable 
theory (   ) of quantum mechanics assumes 
that all natural processes are local: information 
and correlations are propagated at most at the 
speed of light. In physics, hidden-variable 
theories are proposals to provide explanations of 
quantum mechanical phenomena through the 
introduction 
of 
unobservable 
hypothetical 
entities. However, quantum mechanics does not 
assume the existence of local hidden variables 
associated with individual particles. Quantum 
nonlocality does not allow for faster-than-light 
communication, [5] and hence is compatible with 
special relativity and its universal speed limit of 
objects. In the words of Lewis Carroll Epstein: 
“You can’t go faster than the speed of light 
because you can’t go slower than the speed of 
light. You are always going at the speed of light 
through spacetime. If you use some of your 
speed to go through space, then there is less 
speed through time”. Indeed, a semi-classical 
perspective can explain the notion of the 
entanglement; indeed, entanglement of photons 
can be explained in terms of the relativistic 
properties of space-time as defined by Einstein 
as well as by quantum mechanics. Yet, regarding 
photons and the theory of special relativity, all 
photons moving at the speed of light, the 
separation between those two points would be 
zero from the perspective of those photons. 
Those entangled photons which share one or 
more degrees of freedom at the quantum level 
between each photon cannot be described 
independently of the quantum state of the others 
because they share degrees of freedom. We can 
say thus that quantum theory is local in the strict 
sense defined by special relativity and, as such, 
the term "quantum nonlocality" is sometimes 
considered a misnomer. 
 
1.4 Definition 
of 
the 
Measurement 
Problem 
within 
the 
Entropic 
Information Theory Framework 
 
“What complicates this somewhat is that the 
major interpretations of quantum mechanics 
claim that a measurement causes decoherence. 
This is because the purpose of interpretations of 
quantum mechanics is to link the world of 
quantum mechanics to a hypothetical world 
governed 
by 
classical 
mechanics. 
This 
connection is made through vague terms like 
measure and collapse. The correlation predicted 
by quantum mechanics is due to the quantum 
entanglement of the pair, with the idea that their 
state is determined only at the point where a 
measurement is made on one or the other. This 
idea is entirely consistent with Heisenberg's 
uncertainty 
principle, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics” 
[6]. 
 
"It’s one thing to say that measurement requires 
information. It’s another thing to say that the 
thing being measured is created by the observer 
doing the measuring" [7]. 
 
Following the approach of Entropic Information 
Theory, we can say that during a measurement, 
to be informed by the measurement system, the 
measurer needs information; take information 
from the system during the measurement 

 
 
 
 
Denis; PSIJ, 26(6): 39-58, 2022; Article no.PSIJ.93575

process; but with measurement, the new system 
to consider is the system: "measurer-the thing to 
be measured", both parts of the system under 
consideration share one or more degrees of 
freedom. The two parts of the quantum system 
considered are entangled. It is a question of 
relating to the definition of information given by 
the approach of Entropic Information Theory, 
where a quantum state change due to the 
modification of a degree of freedom at the 
quantum level is the definition of quantum 
information, and by the proposed definition of 
entanglement, where, following the approach of 
Entropic 
Information 
Theory, 
quantum 
entanglement is the physical phenomenon that 
occurs when a group of particles is generated, 
interacts, or shares spatial proximity in such a 
way that one or more degrees of freedom are 
shared at the quantum level between each 
particle in the group, these particles cannot be 
described independently of the quantum state of 
the others because they share degrees of 
freedom. 
 
1.5 Definition of the Core of the Entropic 
Information Theory Framework 
 
“Entropic Information Theory is based on the 
information bit, where the quantum information of 
the bit is defined as a change in a quantum state 
due to the modification of a degree of freedom at 
the quantum level. Entropic Information Theory is 
based on the degree of freedom of the quantum 
system under consideration, based on the 
number of bits needed to specify the actual 
microscopic 
configuration 
among 
the 
total 
number 
of 
allowed 
microstates 
and 
thus 
characterize the macroscopic states of the 
system under consideration” [8]. Indeed, a 
probability distribution of possible states through 
a statistical set of all microstates defines a 
macrostate which is a state that can be observed 
experimentally. Entropy makes it possible to 
estimate the amount of information lost when 
microscopic 
information 
is 
summarized 
by 
macroscopic information. "We can say that 
entropy is information: indeed, in micro-canonical 
language, entropy is determined by the number 
of 
microstates 
compatible 
with 
a 
given 
macrostate” [9]. Considering the principle of 
mass-energy-information 
equivalence 
already 
stated by Melvin Vopson [10] proposing that a bit 
of information is not only physical, as already 
demonstrated, but that it has a finite and 
quantifiable mass while it stores information. The 
Entropic Information Theory sheds light on new 
global perspectives by introducing the mass of a 
bit of information into some famous equations in 
physics such as the hidden thermodynamics 
formula of Louis de Broglie, the classical 
formulation of entropy, the Bekenstein-Hawking 
entropy formula, the Bekenstein bound, or even 
some of Casini's work [11] leading to a new 
global mathematical framework based on the 
Entropic Information Theory approach. 
 
2 METHODOLOGY 
 
We start from the hidden thermodynamics of 
Louis de Broglie, 
      
 
    
       
 
, where we 
inject the mass of bit of information of the 
principle of equivalence mass-energy-information 
of Vopson,         
        
  
, proposing that a bit 
of information is not only physical, as already 
demonstrated, but that it has a finite and 
quantifiable mass while it stores information, 
leading to the expression of a new formulation of 
entropy,     
       
 
, by calculation based on 
the degree of freedom, on the number of bits in 
the system [8]. Several formulations of this 
entropy based on different relations, Einstein's 
mass-energy equivalence,             
 
, The 
Einstein Planck relation,              or based 
on the Avogadro number,   
            
          , are 
formulated. After that, we inject the Hawking 
temperature,     
 
 
   
    , into the new general 
entropy formula leading to a new formulation of 
the 
Bekenstein-Hawking 
entropy 
formula, 
      
            
      
 , a new formulation that can 
explain how this entropy occurs, based on the 
evaporation time of the black hole and on the 
degree of freedom of the black hole seen as an 
whole quantum system. After that, we dive into 
Casini's work on Von Neumann entropy and the 
Bekenstein bound, giving the proof that the 
Bekenstein bound is valid using quantum field 
theory [12-20], we can talk about the process of 
emergence of quantum gravity through the 
fundamentality of entangled quantum information 
by considering that information emerges from 
degree of freedom. Then, with the help of the 
formula of Entropic Information Theory, we 
answer the question "What is the informational 
content of the observable universe?". And based 
on this approach, we estimated the amount of 
energy associated with this number of bits 
representing the informational content of the 
observable universe. These two estimates are 
candidates for dark matter and dark energy 
respectively.

2.1 Generalization 
of 
the 
Entropic 
Information 
Theory 
framework 
to 
Entropy with Entropic Formulas 
 
The generalization of the framework of the 
Entropic Information Theory is based on a new 
concept of entropy based on the introduction of 
the mass of the bit of information revealing new 
entropic formulas.  
 
In general, entropy is related to the number of 
possible microstates according to Boltzmann's 
principle: 
 
           
 
Where  
 
  is the entropy of the system, 
  Boltzmann's constant,  
  is the number of microstates. 
 
  = 
number 
of 
states 
or 
microstates, 
characterized by the position and velocity of all 
particles so if we consider that the degree of 
freedom of a system can be viewed as the 
minimum number of coordinates required to 
specify a configuration. So YES ... W reflects the 
degree of freedom of a system [8]. 
 
Boltzmann entropy formula can be derived from 
Shannon entropy formulae when all states are 
equally probable 
 
                
        
 
 
          
 
So, you have   microstate equiprobable with 
probability    
 
  
 
We start this generalization by introducing the 
mass of bit of information formula into the hidden 
thermodynamics of Louis De Broglie: 
 
      
 
           
 
 
 
Where: 
 
   Boltzmann's constant 
                   
With                     
 
and            
 
      
 
  
    
 
   
       
 
  
        
 
  
 
We introduce the mass of bit of information into 
this relation as being: 
 
                
  
 
 
Where:  
 
   Boltzmann's constant 
   the temperature at which the bit of information 
is stored. 
   Time required to change the physical state of 
the information bit 
                 
 
      
 
      
 
  
        
  
   
 
           
 
          
 
 
 
      
 
    
 
             
 
           
 
         
 
                  
 
 
 
We obtain the validity proof by the Landauer limit 
as 
 
           
 
      
  
 
              
 
Indeed, the Landauer limit is the minimum 
possible amount of energy required to erase one 
bit of information, known as the Landauer limit: 
 
As       
 
             
 
Landauer’s principle can be derived from 
microscopic considerations [21] as well as 
derived from the well-established properties of 
the Shannon-Gibbs-Boltzmann entropy [22]. The 
principle thus appears to be fundamental and 
universal in application. Landauer’s principle 
applies both to classical and to quantum 
information. 
 
Moreover, as Entropy:

44 
 
           
 
We obtain a new value for the general entropy S 
formula based on the hidden thermodynamics of 
de Broglie with the introduction of mass of bit of 
information [23]: 
 
                     
 
 
 
            
 
 
 
With           expressed in the number of bits 
of information 
 
 
regarding the relation            , this new 
entropy concept [8] can take the form of  
 
           
 
 
 
with Einstein mass energy equivalence,        
    , this is  
 
            
 
, 
 
with Planck Einstein relation      , this is with 
h= 
 
    
 
     
       
 
  
, 
 
            
 
With kT =

as the Boltzmann constant may be used in place 
of the molar mass constant by working in pure 
particle count, N, rather than the amount of

2.2 Generalization 
of 
the 
Entropic 
Information Theory Framework to 
Quantum Gravity with Black Hole 
Entropic Formulas  
 
The theory of entropic information enters the 
problem of the black hole by introducing 
Hawking’s temperature into equations where the 
mass of the bit of information has been 
implemented in entropic formulas.  
 
We start from this equation obtained by the 
introduction of mass bits of information into the 
hidden thermodynamics of Louis de Broglie 
 
                 
 
 
 
wherein we inject the Hawking Temperature 
represented by this formula: 
 
     
 
   
     
 
With   
  
  , 
 
       
  
 
   
            
 
 
 
we obtain after simplification of k and h: 
 
               
       
 
It can also be shown that the Boltzmann entropy 
is an upper bound to the entropy that a system 
can have for a fixed number of microstates 
meaning [24]:

With W reflecting the degree of freedom of the 
considered system 
 
W 
= 
number 
of 
states 
or 
microstates, 
characterized by the position and velocity of all 
particles so if we consider that the degree of 
freedom of a system can be viewed as the 
minimum number of coordinates required to 
specify a configuration. So YES ... W reflects the 
degree of freedom of a system [8] 
 
We obtain the black hole entropy formula, at the 
hawking 
temperature, 
based 
on 
bits 
of 
information and the mass of bit of information, 
 
                     
       
 
The universal form of the bound was originally 
found by Jacob Bekenstein in 1981 as the 
inequality  
 
       
  
 
 
Where: 
 
S is the entropy,  
k is Boltzmann’s constant,  
R is the radius of a sphere that can enclose the 
given system,  
E is the total mass–energy including any rest 
masses,  
ħ is the reduced Planck constant, 
c is the speed of light.  
 
Note that while gravity plays a significant role in 
its enforcement, the expression for the bound 
does not contain the gravitational constant G.  
 
In informational terms, the relation between 
thermodynamic entropy S and Shannon entropy 
H is given by  
 
          
 
whence  
 
  
    
         
With E=mc² 
 
   
            
        
 
  
   
       
 
In the frame of a Black hole evaporating by 
Hawking radiation at the Hawking temperature 
with a time required to change the physical state 
of all the bits of information of the system equal 
to the time required by the black hole to 
evaporate (      . 
 
                         
      
 
 
With W reflecting the degree of freedom of a 
system. 
 
We see the relationship between the degree of 
freedom and the process of evaporation of the 
black hole. 
 
Where: 
 
              
          
 
We have showed that the black holes entropic 
information formula  
              
      
 is equal to the 
universal bound, 
     
  
 and that it is about the 
degree of freedom of black hole seen as a whole 
quantum system. 
 
We can see in Figs 4 to 7, the results obtained 
by the Entropic Information Theory approach in 
comparison to the Black hole entropy classical 
method of calculation. Regarding Black hole 
value of mass taken for the black holes 
considered all along the scale of the size of the 
black hole, those values are extremal, indeed we 
begin with GW170817 with a mass of 2.7 solar 
mass to go until the mass of the TON618 black 
hole which is equal to 66 billion of solar mass 
[23] passing by CYGNUS X1 or by MESSIER87 
for the other black hole masses considered. In 
this way, we have passed in review of all the 
scale sizes of the black holes. 
 
This allows us to have a global vision of the 
mass of the black holes along the scale. The 
results obtained are based on the two different 
relations from the entropic information approach 
as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the informational 
relation and the Planck relation; the other part of 
the results is from the classical method of black 
hole entropy.

As a side note, we must take into account that 
the black Hole information paradox can be 
established using the standard Copenhagen 
method of keeping the system separate from the 
measuring device. The black hole information 
paradox 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
quantum 
measurement problem. As such we can discuss 
the solutions to the information paradox without 
committing to any particular interpretation of 
quantum mechanics. 
 
We know, following the work of Casini in 2008 
about the Von Neumann entropy and the 
Bekenstein bound, that the proof of the 
Bekenstein bound is valid using quantum field 
theory [12-20].

For example, given a spatial region,  , Casini 
defines the entropy on the left-hand side of the 
Bekenstein bound as 
 
             
    
 
                    
       
   
 
Casini defines the right-hand side of the 
Bekenstein bound as the difference between the 
expectation value of the modular Hamiltonian in 
the excited state and the vacuum state, 
 
The ingenious proposal of Casini is to replace 2 
  R E, by: 
 
                 
   
 
With these definitions, the bound reads  
 
      
 
which can be rearranged to give: 
 
                       
     
 
This is simply the statement of positivity of 
quantum relative entropy, which proves the 
Bekenstein bound. 
 
In Casini’s work, on the right-hand side of the 
Bekenstein bound, a difficult point is to give a 
rigorous interpretation of the quantity 2   R E, 
where R is a characteristic length scale of the 
system and E is a characteristic energy.  
 
This product has the same units as the generator 
of a Lorentz boost, and the natural analog of a 
boost in this situation is the modular Hamiltonian 
of the vacuum state  
 
           
   
 
As black holes entropic information formula is 
equal to Bekenstein universal bound. 
 
As a side note, it can also be shown that the 
Boltzmann entropy is an upper bound to the 
entropy that a system can have for a fixed 
number of microstates 
 
Where S     is the Von Neumann entropy of the 
reduced density matrix    associated with  ,   in 
the 
excited 
state 
 , 
and     
   is 
the 
corresponding Von Neumann entropy for the 
vacuum state    
 
Finally, we obtain: 
 
                 
    
 
             
      
  
 
            
               
    
 
                    
       
    
     
  
 
 
Naïve definitions of entropy and energy density 
in quantum field theory suffer from ultraviolet 
divergences. In the case of the Bekenstein

bound, ultraviolet divergences can be avoided by 
taking the differences between the quantities 
calculated 
in 
the 
excited 
state 
and 
the                     
same quantities calculated in the empty state 
[25]. 
 
2.3 Generalization 
of 
the 
Entropic 
Information Theory Framework to 
Dark Matter with the Informational 
Content of the Universe  
 
How many bits of information are there in the 
content of the observable universe?” 
  
Going back as far as the late 1970s, since, in 
several studies, this question has been 
addressed and several answers have been 
given. For example, using the Bekenstein–
Hawking formula for the black-hole entropy 
[26,27] the information content of the universe 
has been calculated by Davies [28] 
 
         
 
  
             
 
where 
 
G is the gravitational constant,  
Mu is the mass of the universe enclosed within 
its horizon, 
h is Planck’s constant, 
c is the speed of light.  
 
Wheeler’s approach which estimated the number 
of bits in the present universe at T = 2.735 K 
from entropy considerations, resulting in 8 ×      
bits content [29]. Or Lloyd which took a similar 
approach and estimated the total information 
capacity of the universe as [30].  
 
   
 
                   
  
             
 
where:  
 
S is the total entropy of the matter dominated 
universe,  
   is the Boltzmann constant,  
  is the matter density of the universe,  
t is the age of the universe at present,  
c is the speed of light. 
 
"If the principle of mass-energy-information 
equivalence is correct and information does have 
mass, a digital informational universe would 
contain a lot of it, and perhaps the missing dark 
matter could be just information," Vopson said.  
 
Vopson even went so far as to speculate that the 
dark matter that holds galaxies together could 
also be composed of information. He said that 
since for more than 60 years we have been 
trying unsuccessfully to understand what dark 
matter is, it could very well be information.  
 
It is well-accepted that the matter distribution in 
the Universe is 5% ordinary baryonic matter, 
27% dark matter and 68%, dark energy [31]. 
 
The estimation of the bits of information 
contained in the observable universe can be 
calculated via the entropic information approach 
giving an accurate calculation of the bit content 
from the new formulation of entropy, entropy 
based on the mass of the information bit given as 
follows: 
 
            
 
 
 
with Einstein mass–energy equivalence, Energy= 
mc², this is  
 
            
 
, 
 
We use the mass of the universe and the age of 
this one for the calculations as 
 
                       
 
                                  
 
N.B: Here, with the Entropic Information Theory 
approach 
of 
the 
notion 
of 
entropy, 
the 
relationship between thermodynamic entropy S 
and Shannon entropy H is given by    
         is not used to convert the result into 
informational terms because the result of the 
Entropic Information Theory approach of entropy 
is expressed in informational terms, indeed It is 
the mass bit of the information that has been 
implemented to the initial equation considered, 
so the results of the entropy are expressed in the 
number of bits. Indeed, as seen above, the 
theory of entropic information is based on the 
number of bits of the system, the number of bits 
necessary to specify the real microscopic 
configuration 
among 
the 
total 
number 
of 
microstates 
allowed 
and 
thus 
characterize                 
the 
macroscopic 
states 
of 
the 
system 
considered.

This number estimated by calculation from 
Entropic Information Theory is remarkably close 
to an estimate of the bit-of-information content of 
the Universe with      bits that would be 
sufficient to account for all the dark matter 
missing 
in 
the 
visible 
Universe 
following              
Vopson using the reasoning developed following 
[32] 
 
Taking the estimated mass of our Milky                   
Way galaxy as  7       M solar masses [33], 
and using the mass of the sun M  2       Kg, 
then the estimated dark matter mass in our 
galaxy is               3.78       M = 7.56  
     Kg. Assuming that all the missing dark 
matter is made up of bits of information, then                 
the entire Milky Way galaxy has Nbits (Milky 
Way) =               /     (T=2.73K) = 2.59  
     bits. The estimated number of galaxies in 
the visible Universe is  2       [34], so the 
estimated total number of bits of information in 
the visible Universe is  52       bits. 
Remarkably, this number is reasonably close to 
another estimate of the Universe information bit 
content of      given by Gough in 2008 using 
Landauer’s principle via a different approach 
[35]. 
 
Vopson estimated that around 5,2 ×      bits 
would be enough to account for all the missing 
dark 
matter 
in 
the 
observable 
universe 
[32,36,37]. 
 
The 
estimated 
bit 
content 
of 
the                        
observable universe from entropic information              
is          . Note that           is significantly 
less 
than 
the 
theoretical 
maximum                      
information content of the universe of      bits 
provided by applying the holographic principle 
[26,38] to the universe. In the maximum 
information scenario, corresponding 
to the 
universe 
being 
a 
single 
black 
hole, 
      elementary squares of Planck length are 
needed to cover the surface of the current known 
universe. 
2.4 Generalization 
of 
the 
Entropic 
Information Theory Framework to 
Dark Energy with the Energy of 
Informational Content of the Universe  
 
From [35], we can read that Landauer’s principle 
was originally proposed to describe the energy 
dissipation when information is overwritten in 
computer systems and subsequently used to 
predict the future limits to shrinking computer 
circuit size [39-46]. Moreover, Landauer showed 
that any erasure of information is necessarily 
accompanied 
by 
heat 
dissipation 
[47]. 
A 
corresponding 
minimum            of 
heat 
energy has to be dissipated into the surrounding 
environment to increase the environment’s 
thermodynamic entropy in compensation, and in 
accord with the second law of thermodynamics. 
The total amount of information is conserved as 
the surrounding environment effectively contains 
the erased information, although clearly no 
longer in a form that the computer can use. More 
generally, Landauer’s principle applies to all 
systems 
in 
nature 
so 
that 
any 
system, 
temperature T, in which information is ‘erased’ by 
some physical process will output            of 
heat energy per bit ‘erased’ with a corresponding 
increase in the information of the environment 
surrounding that system. Information is therefore 
directly bound up with the fundamental physics of 
nature. This strong interdependence between 
nature and information is emphasized by 
astrophysicist John Wheeler’s slogan "it from bit" 
and computer scientist Rolf Landauer’s maxim 
“information is physical””. Landauer’s principle is 
fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics 
[22,46,48,49]. 
Landauer’s 
principle 
can 
be 
derived from microscopic considerations [21] as 
well as derived from the well-established 
properties of the Shannon-Gibbs-Boltzmann 
entropy [22]. The principle thus appears to be 
fundamental and universal in application. 
 
Landauer's principle provides an equivalent 
energy for each bit of information or bit of 
entropy. Landauer showed that information is 

 
 
 
 
Denis; PSIJ, 26(6): 39-58, 2022; Article no.PSIJ.93575 
 
 
 
52 
 
physical since the erasure of a bit of information 
in a temperature system,   results in the release 
of a minimum            of energy into the 
system environment [22,50]. Landauer's principle 
has now 
been experimentally 
verified for 
classical bits and quantum qubits [38,51-52]. 
 
This important physical prediction that links 
information theory and thermodynamics was 
experimentally verified for the first time in 2012 
[53]. 
 
However, information entropy is equivalent to 
thermodynamic entropy when the same degrees 
of freedom are considered. The information 
entropy of the physical world is thus the number 
of bits needed to account for all possible 
microscopic states. Then each bit of information 
is 
equivalent 
to 
             
 of 
thermodynamic entropy leading to Landauer’s 
principle 
that                 of 
heat 
is 
dissipated when a computer logic bit is erased 
[35]. 
 
Landauer's principle identifies temperature as the 
only parameter connecting information to energy. 
 
The equivalent energy of the total information, 
given by             , is proportional to both the 
total number of bits and the temperature, and 
therefore proportional to the volume of the 
universe 
as 
in 
the 
volume 
model, 
and 
proportional to the surface of the universe in the 
holographic model. 
 
The equivalent Landauer energy of these 
elementary bits would be defined in a form and 
value identical to the characteristic energy of the 
cosmological constant. 
 
We obtain the equivalent Landauer energy of a 
fundamental bit of information in a universe at 
temperature,      ,      is the total density of 
matter in our universe (baryon + dark). 
 
                           
  
 
        
This Landauer bit energy is defined identically to 
the characteristic energy of the cosmological 
constant, the cosmological constant is closely 
associated with the concept of dark energy. The 
right-hand side of this equation is identical to 
equation 17.14 of [54] for the characteristic 
energy of the cosmological constant—with the 
sole addition of ln(2) to convert between entropy 
units—between natural information units, nats, 
and bits. Information bit energy might then 
explain the low milli-eV (0.003 eV) characteristic 
energy of Λ, which Peebles [54] considered to be 
‘too low to be associated with any relevant 
particle physics [55]. 
 
The dark energy density in the universe is about 
7×      g/cm3 
on 
average 
according 
to 
Wikipedia. This is uniform throughout the Hubble 
volume of the entire universe i.e. the volume of 
the universe with which we are in causal contact. 
The Hubble volume is          i.e. cubic light 
years. This gives 8.46732×      cm3 as the 
volume of the universe. Using the mass-energy 
equivalence, you find that the total dark energy 
content in the entire universe is around 
    Joules. 
 
If we use the value obtained by the informational 
entropy for the estimation of the number of bits 
corresponding to all the mass content of the 
whole observable universe. 
 
With the formula of total information equivalent 
energy, given by Landauer’s principle: 
 
                    
 
              
 
The Entropic Information Theory can provide a 
quantitative account for dark energy, accounting 
for the present energy value, ∼    Joules. The 
Entropic 
Information 
Theory 
provides 
an 
estimation of           Joules remarkably close 
to this estimation.

3. DISCUSSION 
 
By way of introduction, we have reviewed some 
fundamental claims about quantum information 
theory from the perspective of the Entropic 
Information Theory approach based on the mass 
of the bit of information. Indeed, after having 
defined the notion of quantum information, 
quantum entanglement, and non-locality as well 
as the consideration of the measurement 
problem within the approach of the generalization 
of entropic information, this generalization lifts 
the veil on certain new formulations of notions of 
entropy based on the degree of freedom of the 
system considered. This new approach to 
entropic information is built on the bit of 
information considered as the change of the 
quantum state due to the modification of a 
degree of freedom of the system considered. 
This new informational approach taking into 
account the mass of the bit of information reveals 
new formulas of entropy based on different 
mathematical and physical perspectives; leading 
to the expression of new formulas of this 
particular entropy based on different relations, 
Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, the Einstein 
Planck relation or based on the Avogadro 
number. 
 
These perspectives, as part of this generalization 
of Entropic Information Theory, can lead us to in-
depth reflection. Indeed, we can see a new 
perspective on defining life in the approach of 
Entropic Information Theory. Based on the mass 
of 
the 
bit 
of 
information 
and 
entropic 
considerations, we can see life following Entropic 
Information Theory as the storage of information 
and the possibility of updating it through a self-
learning process to perpetuate this form of 
information, because the structures are ordered 
by 
storing 
information, 
the 
structure 
is 
information building. We can think of entropic 
structures as ordered as follows: “non-living 
entropic structure”, “living entropic structure”, 
“thinking 
entropic 
structure”, 
and 
“knowing 
entropic structure” (conscious one). With the fact 
that without information, the conscious has 
nothing to know. The conscious is considered as 
a specific processing of information based on 
“conscious individuality”, individuality based on 
memory, and memory on the storage of 
information. More specifically the human brain, 
calculates but not only; some human brain 
processes (such as intuition or creation seen as 
a not computable brain process from what 
emerges a new concept out of logical algorithm) 
are 
outside 
algorithmic 
logics 
so 
that 
consciousness or the universe cannot be coded.  
 
After all these distant considerations based on 
entropic 
considerations, 
following 
the 
continuation of the new formulations of the new 
different forms of entropy in the approach of 
Entropic Information Theory, we have shown that 
the entropic information formula of the black hole 
taking into account the mass of bit of information 
at 
Hawking 
temperature 
reveals 
a 
new 
formulation of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.  
 
With the help of Casini's work on the entropy of 
von Neumann and Bekenstein bound. And since 
the new formulation of the entropic information 
black hole formula is also equal to the 
Bekenstein 
bound, 
this 
leads 
to 
new 
considerations about quantum gravity. Indeed, 
the entropic information formula of black holes 
calculates the entropy of Hawking radiation as 
the entangled information of the black hole 
initially considered, this up to the quantum level 
of the system, the degrees of freedom describing 
the black hole, and this regardless of the law of 
the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy area, providing 
a sufficient microscopic description of how this 
entropy arises, showing that the evaporation 
process of black holes conforms to the principle 
of unitarity. In addition, this approach avoids 
ultraviolet 
divergences. 
These 
perspectives 
should be understood as the fine-grained entropy 
formulas discovered by Ryu and Takayanagi. 
The entropy of black holes turns out to be a 
special case of the Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture. 
The Ryu-Takayanagi formula is a general 
formula for fine-grained entropy of quantum 
systems coupled with gravity. This focused on 
the process of emerging quantum gravity through 
the 
fundamentality 
of 
entangled 
quantum 
information [25].  

 
 
 
 
Denis; PSIJ, 26(6): 39-58, 2022; Article no.PSIJ.93575 
 
 
 
54 
 
After that, we looked at an ancient but still topical 
question about the informational content of the 
observable universe: "How much information 
content is in the observable universe?” We were 
able to answer this question using the entropic 
information formula regarding entropy and the 
mass of the information bit. We obtain an 
estimate remarkably close to the dark matter of 
the universe with regard to the approach of 
Entropic Information Theory with a result 
obtained equal to      bits to be related to Melvin 
Vopson recent previous estimate based on a 
result of      bits of information, which would be 
sufficient, following Vopson, to account for all the 
dark matter missing in the visible Universe [32], 
[36,37]. The result of the Entropic Information 
Theory approach can also be related to Lloyd's 
approach which estimated the total information 
capacity of the universe at      bits of 
information [30]. In addition, we calculated the 
energy associated with this number of bits of 
informational content of the observable universe; 
to obtain again a result remarkably close to the 
actual estimate of dark energy being      joules; 
indeed, 
the 
Entropic 
Information 
Theory 
approach gives an estimate of      joules for 
estimating all the dark energy of the entire 
observable 
universe. 
A 
more 
detailed 
perspective on the estimation of dark energy, 
leads to see the result obtained in the form of the 
energy 
characteristic 
of 
the 
cosmological 
constant which is closely associated with the 
concept of dark energy. 
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
 
The Entropic Information Theory is based on the 
mass of the bit of the information of the system 
considered. This is to be put about the definition 
of quantum information which, from the point of 
view of entropic information, is a change of 
quantum state due to the modification of a 
degree of freedom in the quantum system 
considered. This definition of the notion of 
quantum information is itself consistent with the 
definition of entanglement proposed; in fact, 
according to entropic information, quantum 
entanglement can be defined as the physical 
phenomenon that occurs when a group of 
particles is generated, interacts, or shares spatial 
proximity in such a way that one or more degrees 
of freedom are shared at the quantum level 
between each particle of the group; a particle 
that cannot be described independently of the 
quantum state of others because they share 
degrees of freedom.  
We must be aware that a semi-classical 
perspective 
can 
explain 
the 
notion 
of 
entanglement; regarding entangled photons and 
the theory of special relativity, all photons moving 
at the speed of light, the separation between 
those two points would be zero from the 
perspective of those photons. Quantum theory is 
thus local in the strict sense defined by special 
relativity. 
 
These quantum perspectives are themselves 
consistent with the entropic information approach 
of the measurement problem, in essence, during 
a 
measurement, 
to 
be 
informed 
by 
the 
measurement system, the measurer needs 
information; take information from the system 
during the measurement process; but with 
measurement, the new system to consider is the 
system: “measurer-the thing to be measured”, 
the two parts of the system considered share one 
or more degrees of freedom of the considered 
quantum system.  
 
The 
Entropic 
Information 
Theory 
as 
an 
informational approach is mathematically based 
on the mass of bits of information, this was 
injected into the hidden thermodynamics of Louis 
de Broglie revealing a new entropic relationship 
based on the degree of freedom, on the number 
of bits of the system considered. That let’s 
appear some new entropy formulations based on 
different mathematical and physical perspectives; 
leading to the expression of new formulations of 
this 
particular 
entropy 
based 
on 
different 
relations; Einstein mass-energy equivalence, 
Planck Einstein relation, or based on the 
Avogadro number. 
 
Based on those perspectives some far deep 
considerations have been explored. Indeed, 
based on the mass of the bit of information and 
entropic considerations, we can define life 
following the entropic information theory as the 
storage of the information and the possibility to 
update it by a process of self-learning to 
perpetuate that form of information as the 
structures are ordered by storage of information.  
 
Mathematically, at this point, we have been 
capable 
to 
express 
several 
new 
entropy 
formulations wherein we have introduced the 
Hawking temperature formula which express 
itself by all the constant in modern physics 
bringing together: relativity, gravitation, quantum 
physics, and thermodynamics, leading to new 
expressions of black holes entropy. The Entropic 
Information 
Theory 
approach 
gives

mathematical interpretation of the microstates 
considered when calculating the entropy of black 
holes. Moreover, the new formulation of the 
entropic information approach, based on the 
information bit, shows that the evaporation 
process of black holes is consistent with the 
principle of unitarity while avoiding ultraviolet 
divergences and expressing the fine-grained 
gravitational entropy of a black hole using the 
rules of gravity. This allows a semi-classical 
gravitational approach to expressing the fine-
grained gravitational entropy of the black hole.  
 
Moreover, the entropic information formula of 
black holes calculates the entropy of Hawking 
radiation as the entangled information of the 
black hole initially considered, this up to the 
quantum level of the system, the degrees of 
freedom describing the black hole, and this 
regardless of the law of the Bekenstein-Hawking 
entropy area, providing a sufficient microscopic 
description of how this entropy arises. At this 
level we can relate the entropic information of 
black holes with the Ryu-Takayanagi formula 
which is a general formula for the fine-grained 
entropy of quantum systems coupled to gravity. 
As The black hole entropy horizon law which 
turns out to be a special case of the Ryu–
Takayanagi conjecture, we can put emphasis on 
the process of emergence of quantum gravity 
through the fundamentality of entangled quantum 
information [25].  
 
After that, we answered to the ancient but still 
topical question "How much information content 
is in the observable universe?” The Entropic 
Information Theory results are remarkably close 
to recent previous estimates of the dark matter of 
the universe. Moreover, the Entropic Information 
Theory approach gives an estimate of all the 
dark energy of the entire observable universe, 
again a result remarkably close to the actual 
estimate of dark energy. We are here, in the 
presence of a particular mathematical theoretical 
framework capable of explaining in the approach 
of Entropic Information Theory based on the 
mass of the bit of information various processes 
as being several aspects of the entangled 
informational 
content 
of 
the 
universe 
by 
considering that information emerges from 
degree of freedom.
